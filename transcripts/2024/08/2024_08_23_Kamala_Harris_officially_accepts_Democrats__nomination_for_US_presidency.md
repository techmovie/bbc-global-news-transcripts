*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:20.840* :  by advertising. Hi, it's Mark Bitman, host of Food with Mark Bitman. There are so many ways to
*00:20.840- 00:26.420* :  save on quality items at Whole Foods Market every single day, so here's some hints for doing that
*00:26.420- 00:32.180* :  coming into back to school season. One, check out the weekly sales at WholeFoodsMarket.com,
*00:32.380- 00:37.060* :  gets refreshed every Wednesday, so be sure to check them. Two, remember to look for
*00:37.060- 00:43.940* :  365 by Whole Foods Market, Snacks, Salads, and more. Three, just walk the store and look for
*00:43.940- 00:49.680* :  those little yellow signs that mention low price. There's one next to the responsibly farmed salmon
*00:49.680- 00:54.240* :  right now in the seafood department. There are so many ways to save at Whole Foods Market,
*00:54.240- 00:59.260* :  and now you know. Ryan Reynolds here from Midmobile. With the price of just about everything
*00:59.260- 01:04.640* :  going up during inflation, we thought we'd bring our prices down. So to help us, we brought in a
*01:04.640- 01:09.340* :  reverse auctioneer, which is apparently a thing. Midmobile unlimited, premium wireless,

*01:25.440- 01:35.480* :  CDTL. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Andrew Pageant at 13 hours
*01:35.480- 01:41.480* :  GMT on Friday the 23rd of August. These are our main stories. Kamala Harris officially accepts
*01:41.480- 01:47.300* :  the Democrats nomination for the US presidency. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi embraces
*01:47.300- 01:52.460* :  Ukraine's president on a trip to Kiev just weeks after he sparked anger by hugging Vladimir
*01:52.460- 01:58.400* :  Putin in Moscow. The UN says the military and political situation has deteriorated in Libya
*01:58.400- 02:03.260* :  in recent months with reports of paramilitary forces mobilising in the capital Tripoli.
*02:05.600- 02:10.840* :  Also in this podcast, a transgender woman from Australia wins a discrimination case after
*02:10.840- 02:16.940* :  being denied access to a women-only social media app. And a new discovery about how mosquitos
*02:16.940- 02:23.820* :  use infrared to detect the presence of humans. It heats up some neurons at the end of the antenna
*02:23.820- 02:33.720* :  on the mosquitos and that is what's being said. Kamala Harris has promised a new way forward in
*02:33.720- 02:38.840* :  American politics as she accepted the Democratic nomination for president. Addressing cheering
*02:38.840- 02:43.860* :  supporters at her party's national convention in Chicago, the vice president said there was a
*02:43.860- 02:49.040* :  fleeting chance to move past division and bitterness. She'll take on Donald Trump in what's
*02:49.040- 02:54.360* :  likely to be a bitter fight for the White House in November. Our correspondent Emma Vardy was at
*02:54.360- 02:59.000* :  the Democratic National Convention to see her set out her vision for the nation she hopes to lead.
*03:02.520- 03:05.360* :  A month ago, many people did not envisage this moment.
*03:05.420- 03:12.200* :  America's lesser known seconding command propelled into the starring role.
*03:13.240- 03:18.900* :  Now Kamala Harris is the woman Democrats believe can make history by becoming the first female
*03:18.900- 03:26.460* :  president of the United States. On behalf of everyone whose story could only be written
*03:27.480- 03:33.580* :  in the greatest nation on earth. I accept your nomination.
*03:34.560- 03:39.800* :  She offered Americans a chance to move beyond the highly polarized politics that have defined recent
*03:39.800- 03:49.960* :  years. I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations, a president who
*03:49.960- 04:03.480* :  leads and listens, who is realistic, practical and has common sense and always fights for the American
*04:03.480- 04:11.320* :  people. From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my life's work. And she took the
*04:11.320- 04:15.780* :  fight to her opponent with a warning. Donald Trump is an unserious man.
*04:18.380- 04:26.700* :  But the consequences, but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are
*04:26.700- 04:32.620* :  extremely serious. Women's bodies, she said, would be policed when it comes to America's most
*04:32.620- 04:42.660* :  divisive issue. He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report
*04:43.580- 04:52.260* :  on women's miscarriages and abortions. Simply put, they are out of their minds.
*04:57.660- 05:02.500* :  With the fourth day of protests outside the Convention Centre, Kamala Harris finally addressed
*05:02.500- 05:08.340* :  the war in Gaza. Anger over Joe Biden's handling of the conflict threatens to cost the Democrat
*05:08.340- 05:16.440* :  support. She reiterated her support of Israel. The people of Israel must never again face the horror
*05:16.440- 05:23.740* :  that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7th. But emphasized calls for the
*05:23.740- 05:30.100* :  end of suffering in Gaza. And the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity,
*05:30.100- 05:34.520* :  security, freedom, and self-determination.
*05:41.780- 05:45.640* :  A string of celebrities have thrown their support behind the current vice president.
*05:50.660- 05:55.880* :  Though the Convention finale wasn't the Beyonce or Taylor Swift concerts some had been hoping for.
*05:59.000- 06:03.400* :  But it didn't stop delegates dancing on the floor as balloons rained down from above.
*06:07.880- 06:13.020* :  Calls suggest Kamala Harris has taken the lead in this race. But Republicans have attacked her as
*06:13.020- 06:18.900* :  too liberal and there are fears about the economy and the U.S. border that play to Donald Trump's strengths.
*06:19.600- 06:24.240* :  There is still a lot to overcome if her dream of a new era for America is to be realized.
*06:26.160- 06:30.940* :  Our North America editor Sarah Smith was also watching proceedings in Chicago and taught my
*06:30.940- 06:36.320* :  colleague Justin Webb what she made of it. I think what she was trying to do very much was to look
*06:36.320- 06:40.500* :  and sound presidential. And she came across a little bit differently than she has been doing on
*06:40.500- 06:45.320* :  the campaign trail. There was less of the joyful sunny optimism that we've had from her that would
*06:45.320- 06:50.620* :  such a contrast with the way Joe Biden was running his election campaign before he stepped aside.
*06:51.220- 06:58.580* :  And this was more controlled, more serious, and probably deliberately so in order to introduce
*06:58.580- 07:02.980* :  herself to the country. Not only just who she is and telling us a little bit more of her backstory,
*07:02.980- 07:08.160* :  but very much trying to present herself as somebody that they can see as their president as their
*07:08.160- 07:13.280* :  commander in chief and whom they can trust really with the nation. And if that's what she was trying
*07:13.280- 07:18.620* :  to do, I think it was probably reasonably effective, but it just didn't have the uplifting mood that
*07:18.660- 07:22.060* :  some of the other speakers at this convention have had and that she's been able to bring to some of
*07:22.060- 07:26.280* :  her rallies. Did he get us any closer to knowing what she would do if she became president?
*07:26.420- 07:32.360* :  It's at the tone. I think she gave us some broad brush. She says she wants to cut taxes for lower
*07:32.360- 07:36.060* :  paid people that she wants to build more homes to make the cost of housing more affordable.
*07:36.060- 07:41.120* :  There's a big focus on bringing down the cost of prescription drugs and making access to
*07:41.560- 07:47.480* :  medicine cheaper and easier for people. And a big focus as well on moving the country forward.
*07:47.480- 07:51.840* :  I think there's quite an effective phrase that is using a lot in this campaign and that you
*07:51.840- 07:56.200* :  had chanted around the whole again and again and again, which is we are not going back.
*07:56.400- 08:00.820* :  That sounds fairly superficial, but it can mean quite a number of things. It means we're not going
*08:00.820- 08:05.920* :  back to the guy you've had as president before. You know all about him. You know what it was like
*08:05.920- 08:11.620* :  when he was president. Let's not move back to that. But also it's supposed to represent the idea
*08:11.620- 08:15.760* :  that if Donald Trump was reelected, he would remove some rights from Americans.
*08:15.980- 08:20.620* :  And really interesting Hillary Clinton used to talk a lot when she was running for the presidency
*08:20.620- 08:26.600* :  about the importance of it being the first woman potentially in the White House.
*08:27.040- 08:32.080* :  Kamala Harris didn't mention it. Not one word about the fact that she is only ever the second
*08:32.660- 08:37.440* :  female candidate for a major political party running for president that if elected she would be
*08:37.440- 08:41.880* :  the first woman president, never mentioned a toll in this speech, very, very rarely mentioned
*08:41.880- 08:46.660* :  actually at all by her on the campaign. She doesn't have to. I mean, it's pretty obvious that she
*08:47.220- 08:50.900* :  is a female candidate. It would be the first woman president, but it's not something that she
*08:50.900- 08:55.800* :  makes a big deal about North America. And it's Sarah Smith and we'll have more from the
*08:55.800- 09:01.580* :  Democrat convention in Chicago later in the podcast. I come to Ukraine with a message of peace,
*09:01.580- 09:06.300* :  the words of the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who's on a landmark visit to the country.
*09:06.980- 09:12.680* :  Mr. Modi was greeted in queue by President Flodomir Zelensky. The two leaders stood side by side
*09:12.680- 09:17.800* :  honoring a memorial for children killed in the conflict with Russia. Mr. Modi wrapped his arm
*09:17.800- 09:23.180* :  around Mr. Zelensky's shoulder and he was greeted warmly by members of the Indian business community
*09:28.320- 09:33.020* :  in Kiev. Now the two men's talks could have 10 moments. Weeks ago Mr. Zelensky said it had been
*09:33.020- 09:39.020* :  a devastating blow to see Mr. Modi warmly welcome by Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Previously,
*09:39.020- 09:43.540* :  he's refused to condemn Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine two and a half years ago.
*09:43.800- 09:49.700* :  In fact, since then, India has increased imports of Russian oil throwing a financial lifeline to Moscow.
*09:50.480- 09:54.080* :  Sue Hasini Haida is the different massacres affairs editor of the Hindu newspaper.
*09:54.080- 09:59.580* :  She spoke to Anitra McVeigh. It's quite possible that that embraces what led to this embrace,
*09:59.580- 10:06.300* :  in a sense, because there was a very sharp response from Kiev, from President Zelensky when
*10:06.300- 10:11.740* :  Prime Minister Modi had gone to Moscow on July 9th, met with President Putin. Of course,
*10:12.160- 10:17.780* :  India and Russia have very close ties, very strong ties, traditional ties. Prime Minister Modi's
*10:17.780- 10:25.620* :  visit to Moscow was a two-day visit full of bilateral agreements between the two. In contrast,
*10:25.620- 10:33.120* :  India's ties with the Ukraine are not as long and deep, but Prime Minister Modi has made this
*10:33.120- 10:39.500* :  a priority after his visit to Russia. I think firstly to show that India may not have a balance
*10:39.500- 10:44.300* :  when it comes to ties with Russia and Ukraine, but it certainly wishes to maintain
*10:44.920- 10:50.420* :  the semblance of a balance on the Russia you create more. You will recall that India has so far
*10:50.420- 10:56.020* :  really not come out on one side or the other, saying consistently, it's on the side of peace.
*10:56.600- 11:01.140* :  Prime Minister Modi is saying there are no victors on the battlefield wanting dialogue and diplomacy,
*11:01.660- 11:08.080* :  but not specifically criticizing Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. Nor has it really
*11:08.080- 11:14.940* :  sort of said much about Ukraine either in the last few years. Ukraine had made special requests,
*11:14.940- 11:19.760* :  for example, to come to the G20 to India, and India had not responded very favorably.
*11:20.200- 11:25.040* :  So there's no question that the two leaders have a lot to talk about, but the symbolism as you
*11:25.040- 11:30.280* :  pointed out of the hug between the two leaders seems to indicate that both Kiev and Delhi are
*11:30.420- 11:36.780* :  willing to put maybe the recriminations of the past month behind them and discuss how they can work
*11:36.780- 11:44.680* :  together. Yeah, and Ukraine has been asking India for a number of pieces of practical help, telecoms,
*11:44.680- 11:50.340* :  construction, medical equipment. Is there likely to be any movement on those? And secondly,
*11:50.340- 11:56.020* :  and more significantly, if not now, in a slightly longer term, does India have a role, do you think,
*11:56.020- 12:01.680* :  in facilitating any sort of peace agreement, any sort of ceasefire agreement between Ukraine and
*12:01.680- 12:06.060* :  Russia? The requests from Ukraine have come over the last couple of years, because India has,
*12:06.060- 12:11.900* :  of course, sent about 15 consignments of 10s and blankets, medicines, clothes, that kind of thing.
*12:12.260- 12:18.520* :  And Ukraine has consistently said it wants low cost reconstruction support, having Indian
*12:18.520- 12:25.420* :  companies supply things like telecom towers that have been taken out by Russian strikes.
*12:25.420- 12:31.440* :  Things like medical equipment for the hospitals, construction equipment, digging for reconstruction
*12:31.440- 12:37.540* :  efforts. That's something Delhi has so far dragged its feet on. And the hope is that when Prime
*12:37.540- 12:41.660* :  Minister Modi goes there, the request has been made at different levels, including when
*12:41.660- 12:47.000* :  Foreign Minister Dimitro Kuleva came to Delhi earlier this year. But the hope is that when Prime
*12:47.000- 12:53.380* :  Minister Modi is actually in Kiev, that he will agree to some kind of movement on those specific
*12:53.380- 12:58.780* :  requests, the larger requests, of course, are that India somehow get involved in the peace processes
*12:58.780- 13:04.760* :  again, something India has not done so far. Sue Hasini Hyder from the Hindu newspaper. A
*13:04.760- 13:10.060* :  transgender woman in Australia has won a case against a women-only social media app for alleged
*13:10.060- 13:14.960* :  gender discrimination. It's the first time Australia's federal court has ruled on such an
*13:14.960- 13:20.380* :  issue since changes were made to the country's Sex Discrimination Act in 2013. Here's our
*13:20.380- 13:25.800* :  Australia correspondent Katie Watson. Roxanne Tickle was born male, but changed her gender,
*13:25.800- 13:32.040* :  and since 2017, has been living as a woman. She downloaded the social media app Giggle for Girls in
*13:32.040- 13:38.140* :  2021. In order to gain access, she had to upload a photo to prove she was a woman. Seven months
*13:38.140- 13:43.680* :  after joining, her membership was revoked. Giggle's legal team maintained that sex is a biological
*13:43.680- 13:48.600* :  concept that Ms Tickle was male. The federal court found that she had not been directly
*13:48.600- 13:54.140* :  discriminated against, but was a victim of indirect discrimination, and Giggle was ordered to pay
*13:54.140- 14:01.460* :  her $6,700 US dollars, as well as her costs. This is a landmark decision by the federal court here
*14:01.460- 14:06.720* :  in Australia, and one that will have huge implications for many other countries in how they resolve
*14:06.720- 14:13.440* :  conflicts between gender identity and sex-based rights. Now to a discovery that Mosquitoes have an
*14:13.440- 14:19.680* :  extra weapon in their ability to find humans, infrared detection of body heat. Scientists
*14:19.680- 14:24.920* :  in the US have found that heat imaging is part of their armory. Professor Craig Montel,
*14:24.920- 14:28.060* :  molecular biologist from the University of California, Santa Barbara,
*14:28.440- 14:32.560* :  told my colleague James Cottonall the infrared detection happens in the antennae.
*14:33.140- 14:39.820* :  So our surface body temperature is about 34 degrees centigrade, and that has been converted
*14:39.820- 14:48.760* :  into electromagnetic radiation. That radiation is then converted back into heat. It heats up
*14:48.760- 14:54.860* :  some neurons at the end of the antenna on the mosquitoes, and that is what's being said.
*14:55.560- 15:00.300* :  And the result, presumably, is that wherever the human attempts to hide, the Mosquitoes
*15:00.300- 15:06.260* :  got a pretty good chance of finding you. Well, that's one of the really fascinating things about
*15:06.460- 15:14.420* :  mosquitoes that are driven to find humans in particular. They use lots of different sensory cues.
*15:14.420- 15:20.920* :  They have an arsenal that is really big. They first detect the CO2 coming out of our breath that
*15:20.920- 15:27.060* :  makes them really active, and then they start paying attention to our silhouettes, our images,
*15:27.700- 15:34.780* :  the human odors that come from our skin. And now, they're also sensing at some distance,
*15:34.780- 15:40.460* :  the infrared signature. And then when they get close, they can even really close. Just a few
*15:40.460- 15:45.400* :  centimeters away, they can detect the humidity from our skin, and even the convection heat from
*15:45.400- 15:50.560* :  our skin. And then when they land, they can taste chemicals on our skin. So they need lots of
*15:50.560- 15:56.320* :  different ways of finding us, because under some conditions, some senses are more salient than others.
*15:57.360- 16:02.160* :  It almost sounds as though these mosquitoes are perfectly designed to hunt down humans.
*16:03.560- 16:10.600* :  They are. They absolutely have to find us, because they need the blood meals for egg development.
*16:11.460- 16:18.300* :  And even before humans were around, they were able to hunt down other warm-blooded animals.
*16:18.840- 16:23.420* :  And because their life depends on it, you can imagine what strong selection there was
*16:23.960- 16:31.360* :  to enable these mosquitoes to find us. And the discovery here was that the infrared signatures
*16:32.180- 16:37.940* :  from coming from our bodies, the heat, which is then converted into infrared, they can detect
*16:37.940- 16:42.600* :  our body heat at a distance. Professor Craig Montel from the University of California,
*16:42.600- 16:47.940* :  Santa Barbara, with James Coppnell. Still to come in this podcast?
*16:47.940- 16:55.080* :  You could walk, but it's quite a trek, and almost all of it up hell, or you could try.
*16:56.100- 16:58.300* :  Slightly. I said try.
*16:58.860- 17:02.720* :  Cars aband, at an environmentally friendly music festival in the UK.
*17:11.040- 17:14.040* :  Ryan Reynolds here for, I guess, my hundredth mid commercial.
*17:14.600- 17:16.980* :  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*17:17.320- 17:19.980* :  I mean, honestly, when I started this, I thought I'd only have to do like four of these.
*17:20.240- 17:25.460* :  I mean, it's unlimited premium wireless for $15 and what, how are there still people paying two or
*17:25.460- 17:30.580* :  three times that much? I'm sorry, I shouldn't be victim blaming here. Give it a try at midmobile.com,

*17:46.000- 17:52.120* :  and there was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world. But something happened,
*17:52.900- 17:59.660* :  not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave, forced out.

*18:18.420- 18:22.160* :  The military situation in Libya has deteriorated in the last two months.
*18:22.160- 18:27.320* :  That's the assessment by the UN Mission to the North African country. The UN has also expressed
*18:27.320- 18:32.020* :  concern about reports of paramilitary forces mobilizing in the capital triply.
*18:32.480- 18:37.600* :  Here's our Middle East regional editor, Sebastian Usher. The security situation in Libya has
*18:37.600- 18:43.620* :  been a byword for instability for more than a decade. But the threat of all-out conflict in and
*18:43.620- 18:49.220* :  around triply has appeared to diminish in recent years. Concern has been rising, though, in the
*18:49.220- 18:54.880* :  past couple of months, that armed factions may be preparing for battle in the capital once again.
*18:54.880- 19:01.740* :  The immediate trigger focuses on the central bank and its head, Sadik Al-Khabir, one of the authorities
*19:01.740- 19:06.940* :  in the divided country. The presidency council issued a decision to remove him and his board,
*19:06.940- 19:11.860* :  but the parliament, which is based in the east of the country, has rejected this.
*19:11.860- 19:16.860* :  The crisis comes as the son of a veteran military commander in the east, Halif Haftar,
*19:16.960- 19:22.560* :  has been moving forces down in the southwest after blockading Libya's biggest oil field.
*19:22.560- 19:28.000* :  The move violates for 2020 ceasefire agreement that brought a halt to major combat.
*19:28.000- 19:34.880* :  As these events unfold, diplomats and analysts have been sounding the alarm, the latest to do so is
*19:34.880- 19:40.860* :  the UN mission to Libya, which says that the display of military power and armed confrontations
*19:40.860- 19:46.780* :  is threatening the lives and the security of civilians. Despite a relative respite from violence
*19:46.780- 19:52.640* :  in the past four years, Libya still remains mired in political division with no viable route
*19:52.640- 19:57.720* :  towards a stable democratic future. As the conflict rages in Sudan,
*19:57.720- 20:02.260* :  millions of people are trying to leave and find shelter in neighboring countries like Chad
*20:02.260- 20:08.680* :  or South Sudan, but South Sudan is already facing a humanitarian crisis of its own, with over 75%
*20:08.680- 20:13.640* :  of the population in desperate need and many struggling to feed themselves and their families.
*20:14.320- 20:19.280* :  The British government has just announced a package of around $100 million in aid for these
*20:19.280- 20:23.940* :  three countries. James Cottonall spoke to the British Minister for Development and Women in
*20:23.940- 20:28.880* :  Equality's Analysed Odds. She's been to a camp for displaced people in South Sudan.
*20:29.640- 20:34.400* :  The desperation has not diminished in fact, if anything, it's increased.
*20:35.100- 20:40.100* :  For those who are listening to this to provide a really quick picture of that camp,
*20:40.120- 20:47.380* :  it's essentially an island in the past, an island against flood water with flooding that would
*20:47.380- 20:55.100* :  happen, you know, perhaps every few years. Unfortunately, now the flood waters are not
*20:55.100- 21:00.260* :  receding and so you see very large numbers of people, a hundred thousand people who are
*21:00.260- 21:07.540* :  pretty much marooned with flood water, which is still there. So ultimately, that camp, I think,
*21:07.540- 21:14.620* :  shows how conflict can combine now with the climate crisis to exacerbate extreme poverty.
*21:15.480- 21:19.600* :  And that is a situation faced by South Sudan. I think most of the people in that camp are
*21:19.860- 21:27.160* :  displaced by South Sudan's own civil war, but the country also faces an influx of people from Sudan as
*21:27.160- 21:32.940* :  well, problem after problem after problem. Well, that's right. And of course, many people from
*21:32.940- 21:39.100* :  South Sudan had moved into Sudan because it was safer. Now, there were still cold returners
*21:39.100- 21:43.980* :  are having to come back to South Sudan, some of them have never lived there. They've lived all
*21:43.980- 21:49.660* :  of their lives in Sudan. And I did meet some of those attorneys there in a truly dreadful state,
*21:49.660- 21:54.440* :  some of them had to leave children on the way children died on the way as they were trying to
*21:54.820- 22:01.200* :  escape Sudan, brothers, sisters, parents, dying from diarrhea, from measles, just dying because of
*22:01.200- 22:06.080* :  their rain, because they were not able to escape together. Clearly, there's a desperate situation in
*22:06.080- 22:12.880* :  Sudan. The UK government will continue to push for the warring parties to ultimately hold the
*22:12.880- 22:20.800* :  Jedder agreement to de-escalate, to have the permanent ceasefire that's needed, because the
*22:20.800- 22:27.800* :  humanitarian situation in Sudan is intolerable. Are you optimistic about those talks? I mean,
*22:27.800- 22:31.900* :  there was a difficulty even getting the Sudanese armed forces when the main belligerents even
*22:31.900- 22:39.100* :  to show up. Is there a case for stronger action from Britain, from other interested countries,
*22:40.220- 22:44.860* :  more sanctions, for example, on those who might be dragging their feet in this peace process?
*22:46.200- 22:50.200* :  Well, we're very clear that the warring parties must engage in the peace process,
*22:50.860- 22:56.520* :  and there must be a meaningful ceasefire. And of course, the UK is the pen holder on Sudan in
*22:56.520- 23:02.840* :  the UN Security Council. We've been doing all that we can to really push very hard on this,
*23:02.840- 23:08.020* :  particularly as a new government. We're very concerned about the situation in Sudan. Of course,
*23:08.020- 23:13.620* :  we've been very clear about the need for humanitarian access. Unfortunately, we have not seen
*23:13.620- 23:19.880* :  the access that's needed, and we've been pressing both parties to really prevent any blockages
*23:20.020- 23:24.500* :  on access, because we're not seeing aid getting to those who desperately need it at the moment in Sudan.
*23:25.040- 23:27.120* :  The British government minister, Annelise Darts,
*23:27.440- 23:32.160* :  back to our main story now, the climax of the Democratic National Convention with a speech by
*23:32.160- 23:37.220* :  the party's presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. Rachel Palermo already knows her pretty well
*23:37.220- 23:41.060* :  having been on the Vice President's communications team for the past three years.
*23:41.780- 23:47.960* :  She is very kind. She's very empathetic. She is strategic. She's a brilliant legal mind,
*23:47.960- 23:52.600* :  and she's a person of great character who cares about this country, and she's going to make an
*23:52.600- 23:57.380* :  incredible president. My experience while working with her is there was a lot of attention and a lot
*23:57.380- 24:01.200* :  of interest in her, because every single thing that the Vice President has done while being
*24:01.200- 24:05.920* :  Vice President has made history. And I think you need to look no further than the fight for
*24:05.920- 24:11.260* :  reproductive rights and abortion access. The Vice President jumped on that issue with such
*24:11.260- 24:16.040* :  force and clarity of purpose, because she knew how problematic this was to the fundamental freedoms
*24:16.040- 24:20.880* :  in the United States. And as a part of that, she traveled the country in the midterms she was
*24:20.880- 24:25.860* :  traveling three to four days a week, galvanizing crowds of thousands of people, even then. And she
*24:25.860- 24:31.540* :  was the single most effective communicator on an issue that had a huge impact on the midterm
*24:31.540- 24:37.160* :  elections. And it's why the Democrats did so well in such an unexpected way. The Vice President
*24:37.160- 24:42.600* :  has been intentional about this joy and optimism that's been surrounding her campaign.
*24:42.600- 24:47.260* :  We call her a joyful warrior. And that's something where I think the American people are seeing
*24:47.260- 24:51.680* :  it and they're catching on. And they like the fact that she's running this happy forward-looking
*24:51.680- 24:56.100* :  campaign. And that's why it's felt so electric and exciting here in Chicago this week.
*24:56.740- 25:01.040* :  So if she's elected to the presidency, Kamala Harris will be the first woman to hold that
*25:01.040- 25:06.700* :  office. But she didn't mention that not once in her speech, a firm contrast with Hillary Clinton's
*25:06.700- 25:12.940* :  campaign in 2016. This report from Justin Webb begins with Hillary Clinton's campaign strategist
*25:12.940- 25:19.640* :  at that time, Amanda Renterra. At the time, it just felt like you were kind of watching a movie
*25:19.640- 25:26.680* :  that you could see happening. Tonight, we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a
*25:26.680- 25:34.500* :  more perfect union. The first time that a major party has dominated a woman for president.
*25:37.480- 25:42.340* :  We said it often. The Supreme Court is on the ballot, right? Women's rights aren't just
*25:42.340- 25:47.260* :  guaranteed. You really have to fight for them. And so I felt during that period of time that we
*25:47.260- 25:52.240* :  were giving so many warnings about why it was so important, particularly for young girls,
*25:52.240- 25:58.180* :  to get involved and engaged. And what was odd for me at the time was people just didn't believe
*25:58.180- 26:03.260* :  things would go back. I mean, if you think about it at the moment, right? Women were on the rise.
*26:03.460- 26:07.640* :  People were getting onto boardrooms and CEOs and you would see pictures of that going into
*26:07.640- 26:13.580* :  management. So it didn't seem like it could reverse. And unfortunately, it did reverse.
*26:13.580- 26:19.480* :  But at the time, people were so certain they would see a woman in their lifetime that there's no way
*26:19.480- 26:24.320* :  Roe v Wade would ever get turned back around. You know, it was just a different time.
*26:25.120- 26:29.480* :  What now then? Different times a different woman. And according to Amy Ponds, who wrote a book
*26:29.480- 26:34.820* :  about the Clinton disaster and works now for the Hill newspaper, a different approach from Kamala Harris.
*26:35.960- 26:41.160* :  Everyone knows that she's the first of many things, but she's not leaning into it. She's kind of
*26:41.160- 26:47.120* :  taking the opposite approach as Clinton. Wisely. Wisely. Because I think in me, when you looked at
*26:47.120- 26:52.960* :  the autopsy of Hillary Clinton's campaign, I think a lot of people felt like that was the wrong
*26:52.960- 26:59.120* :  play and the wrong tack. And I think she was advised not to do that. And you're not hearing her talk.
*26:59.120- 27:03.740* :  And you're not hearing her surrogates talk so much about this moment and how she can do it.
*27:03.840- 27:09.520* :  They're saying it's for the people instead of for her. Because however much you might, you know,
*27:09.520- 27:14.200* :  not appreciate toxic masculinity and all the rest of it, there are a lot of men in America aren't
*27:14.200- 27:18.740* :  there. And it's kind of, it's, it feels like a problem on this for the Democratic party that
*27:18.740- 27:23.860* :  it's quite easy for them to put them off. And indeed, if you look at the polls, there is a gap that
*27:24.420- 27:28.720* :  people sort of talk about, whoa, there's a huge gender gap when it comes to men and women supporting
*27:28.720- 27:32.440* :  the Democratic party. Almost as if it's a good thing, but it's, it's not, is it?
*27:32.680- 27:38.680* :  No, and especially when you see where at the convention, Kamala Harris has been able to lock down
*27:38.680- 27:44.320* :  and excite the base. But when you look at who she needs still to win the selection, it's really
*27:44.320- 27:52.880* :  white men, white blue collar, non-educated, non-college educated men. And I think that they're a little
*27:52.880- 27:57.940* :  bit turned off by that. And so I don't think she wants to do that and that's intentional.
*27:58.560- 28:02.720* :  But there is a pushback to the soft pedaling of the historic nature of the Kamala Harris
*28:02.720- 28:07.760* :  campaign. There are women in the Democratic party who are not going to be muted in their joy
*28:07.820- 28:13.140* :  for the sake of politics. It's a debate that has been very live as I heard from Hollywood
*28:13.140- 28:18.500* :  douler and Kate Ahern, two young Democrats excited by the moment. Kate spoke first.
*28:19.560- 28:27.360* :  I think that would be a tremendous mistake. America constantly views itself as being, you know,
*28:27.360- 28:33.440* :  a leader of the free world. And when you compare us to our Democratic peers, other nation states,
*28:33.440- 28:39.840* :  we are so far behind when it comes to the equality we see between the two sexes, right?
*28:40.480- 28:47.160* :  Having office, having this highest office, we've seen such rampant sexism with our female candidates
*28:47.160- 28:54.060* :  and the way that people talk about them. There's this idea that it does not matter what her qualifications
*28:54.060- 29:00.680* :  are. It does not matter how capable, how intelligent, how much of a strong good leader she is.
*29:00.680- 29:07.280* :  But the fact that she is a woman would somehow make her a weaker candidate and to not take a firm
*29:07.280- 29:14.140* :  hard stance and come out positively and strongly as America's first female president, which is
*29:14.140- 29:22.320* :  long overdue, is going to alienate young female voters like us. Okay, I put the same thing to you
*29:22.320- 29:26.060* :  then, Holly. You know, end of the day, policy is what really matters. And we're not just voting for
*29:26.060- 29:29.180* :  her because she's a woman, but we're voting for her because she's a good leader that will represent
*29:29.180- 29:33.900* :  the best interests of American values and people on the national stage and in the White House.
*29:34.440- 29:39.500* :  But additionally, it is really important for us to take a moment to pause and celebrate this moment
*29:39.500- 29:43.760* :  because the fact that we have a woman of color on the presidential ticket is huge.
*29:43.760- 29:49.100* :  I actually see myself at Kamala Harris a lot because she has the South Asian heritage that I do too
*29:49.320- 29:53.520* :  and I think seeing that representation is going to really resonate with a lot of young women,
*29:53.520- 29:57.620* :  especially girls. Like, we ain't even younger girls when they look up and see that they're being
*29:57.620- 30:01.440* :  represented on the biggest stage on international politics. Kate, you're nodding at that.
*30:01.980- 30:10.280* :  Absolutely. To have a female candidate for young Gen Z voters, especially women, is going to be
*30:10.760- 30:17.120* :  finally some sort of positive history that's happening within our lifetimes. It's monumental.
*30:19.180- 30:23.700* :  If you'd like more reaction, go to the latest episode of the Global Story podcast,
*30:23.700- 30:28.000* :  which comes from Chicago, that we're looking at the key moments from the Kamala Harris speech
*30:28.000- 30:33.000* :  and asking if the Democrats can maintain the momentum they have now going into election day.
*30:33.300- 30:36.780* :  Just search for the Global Story, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*30:37.740- 30:41.660* :  Now, this weekend, there are hundreds of music festivals across the UK. They are a much
*30:41.660- 30:47.200* :  loved part of the British summer time. But these big outdoor events can be bad news for the environment.
*30:47.200- 30:52.180* :  And that's why one festival in the West of England, headlined by the 90s banned massive attack,
*30:52.180- 30:57.740* :  he's doing things differently. Our answer correspondent David Sillato has been to Bristol to find out more.
*31:04.280- 31:07.560* :  Massive attack. Bristol's superstars of trip hop.
*31:08.960- 31:11.080* :  Five years after they last played their hometown,
*31:11.920- 31:17.100* :  Rob Del Nyer and Daddy G are back with something that's more than a concert, but a whole new
*31:17.100- 31:21.220* :  approach to festivals. No cars, no diesel, no rubbish.
*31:21.900- 31:27.520* :  It's the first. It's an experiment and we're just quite excited. It's a big deal for us.
*31:27.520- 31:31.780* :  You're making it special. I think the nature of this production makes it special, yeah.
*31:32.380- 31:36.440* :  And it begins with transport. We and the fans want us to come by train,
*31:37.440- 31:40.700* :  but the train only gets you so far that you have to get to the gig.
*31:42.740- 31:47.500* :  You could walk, but it's quite a trek and almost all of it up hill.
*31:51.880- 31:56.360* :  Or you could try cycling. I said, try.
*31:59.420- 32:05.180* :  However, there is an alternative that's rather easier on your legs than the long walk or cycle
*32:05.180- 32:12.800* :  up the hill. A bus. An electric bus. Okay, if I sit anywhere. I've got the bus to myself.
*32:17.060- 32:21.860* :  On site, it's like a green laboratory, a battery-powered green laboratory.
*32:21.860- 32:28.960* :  Dale Vince knows festivals well. In the 80s, he was what used to be called a new-age traveller.
*32:29.280- 32:35.020* :  He's now a renewable energy tycoon. It is the first. An event this size with this many people
*32:35.020- 32:39.520* :  being entirely powered by batteries without a drop of diesel. But why can't you just plug it into the
*32:39.520- 32:43.740* :  mains? Great question, because there's no mains here. And that's the fundamental problem about
*32:43.740- 32:49.060* :  door events. They run on diesel. 12 million litres of diesel burnt annually in our country to power
*32:49.060- 32:54.700* :  outdoor events. 12 million litres. But this is about more than just cars and power, as I found out
*32:55.340- 33:01.040* :  in the T-10s. Where are the cups? There aren't any cups, so you need to bring your own. I haven't
*33:01.040- 33:05.500* :  got a cup. I haven't brought a cup. It's a waste free zone. You're supposed to bring your own cup.
*33:05.500- 33:11.800* :  Most festivals end up being a sea of rubbish. Here, Claire and Eloise are leading the war on waste.
*33:12.020- 33:17.820* :  This is going to be composted. So this stuff that's normally thrown on the ground,
*33:17.880- 33:21.980* :  you can just put in the compost heap. You can. Are you monitoring everything that comes onto the
*33:21.980- 33:27.320* :  site then? Yeah, every part of the site has to be. You're like, I'm coming down here.
*33:28.040- 33:33.880* :  Making sure everything is green. Even the liquid waste is being recycled. And collecting it from
*33:33.880- 33:39.860* :  the female fans, is they say, going to bring about a gender justice. What are we looking at here?
*33:40.440- 33:48.320* :  They are squatting urinals for women and non-binary people. Why? To rebalance the urinal cues.
*33:49.600- 33:56.120* :  This is social justice. Absolutely. We're trying to collect all of the urine to use as a trial
*33:56.120- 34:02.820* :  phosphate in farming in the southwest. And it also just reduces the toilet cues and makes everyone
*34:02.820- 34:09.260* :  much happier. For the band, this is a passion project. This is just something that we love doing.
*34:09.260- 34:16.120* :  It's our bit to help, really. Are you worried? No, I mean, to be honest, this experiment's been five
*34:16.120- 34:21.700* :  years in making and the technical sort of work that's gone into it. It's phenomenal, really.
*34:22.200- 34:24.960* :  And after that, it's time for me to cycle back.

*34:46.380- 34:51.740* :  This edition was produced by Alice Adalee. It was mixed by James Piper. The editor is Karen Martin.
*34:52.060- 34:54.960* :  I'm Andrew Peach. Thanks for listening. And until next time, goodbye.
*35:04.520- 35:09.340* :  We've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right? Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather,
