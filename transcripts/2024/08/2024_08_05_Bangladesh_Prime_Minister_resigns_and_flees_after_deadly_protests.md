*00:40.080- 00:45.480* :  I'm Rachel Wright and at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 5th of August, these are our main stories.
*00:46.020- 00:51.260* :  In Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasena has resigned and fled the country after anti-government
*00:51.260- 00:55.580* :  protests in which hundreds of people have been killed. We'll find out what's been happening
*00:55.580- 01:01.480* :  in the capital of Dhaka. Also, the Japanese stock exchange is one of the worst days in its history
*01:02.040- 01:06.620* :  and tensions are running high in the Middle East following last week's assassinations.
*01:09.400- 01:10.660* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:20.100- 01:26.320* :  the mystery of what happened to American singer Connie Converse, who was born 100 years ago today.
*01:30.620- 01:36.100* :  We start in Bangladesh where after weeks of student protests and more than 300 people killed,
*01:36.100- 01:41.500* :  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasena has resigned and fled the country. There have been jubilant scenes
*01:41.500- 01:44.940* :  but also widespread looting since the news was announced.
*01:51.140- 01:56.380* :  The Army Chief General Waka is someone came on television to announce the Prime Minister's
*01:56.380- 02:03.820* :  resignation and that he would be forming an interim government. The Prime Minister has resigned.
*02:04.380- 02:08.560* :  Now we will run our work by forming an interim government. Have some patience,
*02:08.560- 02:15.020* :  give us some time. Working unitedly will be able to resolve all problems. Don't go for conflict
*02:15.020- 02:22.440* :  anymore and come back to the path of peace. Our South Asia correspondent Samira Hussein has
*02:22.440- 02:28.620* :  been following events from Delhi. After 16 years under the rule of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasena,
*02:28.880- 02:34.860* :  the autocratic leader has fled the country. Huge crowds of cheering protesters stormed her
*02:34.860- 02:40.780* :  official residence in the capital Dhaka. Protests began last month when students demanded that
*02:40.780- 02:46.700* :  quotas and civil service jobs be abolished. But it quickly turned into an anti-government movement
*02:46.700- 02:52.140* :  after the brutal crackdown by police. Bangladesh has not seen this kind of violence since
*02:52.140- 02:58.820* :  as war of independence back in 1971. Protests has looted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasena's official
*02:58.820- 03:04.280* :  residence in the capital Dhaka, some carrying chairs and other furniture out onto the streets.
*03:04.280- 03:10.600* :  Akbar Hussein from BBC Bengali is in the capital. People are celebrating their victory after
*03:10.600- 03:16.780* :  the fall of Sheikh Hasena at one hand. On the other hand, the looting and many people are setting
*03:16.780- 03:24.060* :  fire on police stations and Sheikh Hasena's Awamilik's party offices and some leaders of Awamilik's.
*03:24.440- 03:30.680* :  So, violence is still going on across the country and it is now the prime task for the
*03:31.100- 03:36.860* :  Bangladesh army to maintain law and order and restore normalcy in the country. But in the meantime,
*03:36.920- 03:42.800* :  the Sheikh Hasena, she was flown to India and from where she will be taken to a third country.
*03:42.800- 03:47.820* :  We do not know which country it would be, but definitely she is not going to stay in India
*03:47.820- 03:54.180* :  for a long time or permanently. And Bangladesh's army chief General Walker Zaman, he made a statement
*03:54.180- 03:58.940* :  an hour after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasena left the country where the army chief said that
*03:59.460- 04:04.900* :  an interim government will be formed and this interim government, it will be a non-party
*04:04.900- 04:10.040* :  government. There will be no political affiliation of any political party in this government.
*04:10.520- 04:14.740* :  But he urged protesters to come down and go back to their homes and he said that
*04:15.160- 04:20.740* :  each and every killing would be tried and he urged people to keep faith on Bangladesh's army.
*04:21.560- 04:27.620* :  Our South Asia Regional Editor is Ambarasan Ethorajan. So, what did he think was the catalyst
*04:27.620- 04:33.600* :  for these dramatic developments? People's power as simple as that because this protest has been
*04:33.600- 04:40.100* :  going on for weeks and she underestimated the power of this protest. As you know, I saw this
*04:40.100- 04:45.080* :  in Sri Lanka two years ago when people stormed the palace of Gautabaya Rajapaksha that then
*04:45.080- 04:50.800* :  President now the similar scenes when we did compare the situation similarities about the economic
*04:50.800- 04:58.100* :  problems and how this what they call as autocratic rule really marginalized people triggering anger.
*04:58.100- 05:05.060* :  The pent up anger for over the years was the tipping point was when all these killings happened
*05:05.060- 05:10.100* :  by police in the last few days we were talking about the hundreds of people were shot dead
*05:10.560- 05:14.900* :  and she thought somehow she could cling onto power with the help of the security forces because
*05:14.900- 05:20.540* :  she had the security forces support and might but what she did not predict was it was not simply
*05:20.540- 05:27.980* :  a student movement people from all walks of life civil society activists actors you know people
*05:27.980- 05:34.460* :  journalists people farmers even Rick Shappellers joined this protest that came as a surprise and the
*05:34.460- 05:40.080* :  state was about to collapse and that's when she decided she had to leave. Now the army general has
*05:40.080- 05:46.060* :  said he's forming an entering government can he restore calm I mean is there any faith or trust in
*05:46.060- 05:52.940* :  the army? People do respect the army and he has been urging people to go back to their homes and
*05:52.940- 05:58.480* :  we know that there are some incidents happening in the city itself but they're worried that because
*05:58.540- 06:04.620* :  the army league and the government forces have done so many human rights violations people might
*06:04.620- 06:09.100* :  think it is time for them to take revenge that is a real worry between clashes between political
*06:09.100- 06:14.360* :  parties and also that's why we see the attack on the houses of ministers and that needs to be
*06:14.360- 06:19.260* :  brought under control and that will be the big challenge for the army chief. And what about the
*06:19.260- 06:25.480* :  wider region how do you think they will view this? It came as a shock for many countries no one
*06:25.480- 06:30.600* :  expected that this could happen so quickly because Bangladesh was seen as one of their stable
*06:30.600- 06:35.560* :  countries and what Ashina provided was stability especially for neighboring India a stable
*06:35.560- 06:42.220* :  Bangladesh is very key for India's security and also for China she was in China in fact last
*06:42.220- 06:49.120* :  month to ask for more money for more investment and for other countries like Nepal and in Pakistan
*06:49.120- 06:53.780* :  this has come as a big surprise once again they are seeing the second time in the region in the
*06:53.780- 07:01.520* :  last few years how if people are going to abuse the power then one day the people might take over
*07:01.520- 07:07.060* :  and this is what has happened both in the case of Sri Lanka now we are seeing that in Bangladesh
*07:07.060- 07:14.440* :  so it is a historic moment for many Bangladeshis. Ambarasan etharajan now let's turn to our other
*07:14.440- 07:20.280* :  main story dramatic things have been happening on Asian stock exchanges we're going to find out
*07:20.280- 07:26.180* :  why for our business reporter Marika Oy the biggest drop was in Japan where the Nikkei 225
*07:26.180- 07:32.940* :  index plunged more than 12 percent there were also big falls in South Korea and Taiwan Marika
*07:32.940- 07:38.240* :  who's in Singapore gave us this assessment. I think it's fair to say that people were expecting
*07:38.240- 07:43.880* :  some kind of market movement because of course the Bank of Japan last Wednesday raised the cost
*07:43.880- 07:49.620* :  of borrowing to 0.25 percent which sounds very low and it still is very low compared to the rest of
*07:49.620- 07:55.760* :  the world but the whole point was they were trying to prop up the value of the Japanese yen and
*07:55.760- 08:01.180* :  because the Japanese currency has been falling sharply against the US dollar and the authorities have
*08:01.180- 08:06.340* :  been saying that that's just too weak and it was making you know the cost of imports for you know
*08:06.340- 08:11.960* :  things like fuel and food more expensive so they raised interest rates and as a result it
*08:11.960- 08:17.880* :  prop up the value of the Japanese yen sharply and even though this is exactly what the authorities
*08:17.880- 08:23.940* :  wanted as a nation of exporters Japanese exporters have been suffering quite a lot today
*08:23.940- 08:30.620* :  and also of course last Friday we had a very weak US job state are coming out and that started
*08:31.120- 08:35.780* :  concerns among some investors that the world's biggest economy could be headed for recession now
*08:35.780- 08:41.240* :  some people say that the economy is absolutely fine but just that kind of concerns and worries
*08:41.240- 08:47.120* :  among investors that was that has been triggering this global sell-off as you said in Japan but also
*08:47.120- 08:54.440* :  South Korea in Taiwan Japan's Nikkei 25 it closed down 12.5 percent down but also it was the
*08:54.440- 08:59.980* :  biggest points drop in history so bigger than covid bigger than that huge earthquake that hit the
*08:59.980- 09:07.120* :  nation in 2011 or even bigger than Black Monday of 1987 remarkable and what about the European markets
*09:07.120- 09:12.840* :  they are of course now open what's happening there they are trading lower as well but nothing
*09:12.840- 09:18.600* :  compared to the numbers that we're talking about of course they had already suffered some of
*09:18.600- 09:24.660* :  the sell-off last week as well because it's kind of everyone taking cue from each other and of
*09:24.660- 09:30.720* :  course we'll be watching how the US markets reopen as well but it's really about you know the state
*09:30.720- 09:35.960* :  of the global economy and also the of course the US economy but also it is important to mention that
*09:35.960- 09:41.280* :  this is a summer holiday season where the number of traders is probably fewer and as a result you
*09:41.280- 09:46.920* :  know the minority movement could actually cause a bigger move in a bigger market so that could
*09:46.920- 09:51.480* :  explain why this you know really big jump and fall that we've seen today.
*09:52.000- 09:57.980* :  Orico Oy fears are growing in the Middle East that there will be a major escalation of the conflict
*09:57.980- 10:03.400* :  in the region a statement from Iran today has said that while it doesn't want such an escalation it
*10:03.400- 10:09.900* :  must punish Israel for the death of the Hamas leader in Tehran the killings last week of Ishmael Hanir
*10:09.900- 10:15.740* :  and a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon have increased tensions following nearly 10 months of
*10:15.740- 10:21.240* :  war in Gaza. Israel is now preparing for what could be a prolonged Iranian missile attack.
*10:21.720- 10:27.140* :  Our Middle East correspondent Yolanda Nell is in Jerusalem. This morning in yesterday we continue to
*10:27.140- 10:33.280* :  see Israeli forces and Hezbollah exchanging fire across the Israel Lebanon border but Lebanese
*10:33.280- 10:38.560* :  TV has said that this was not the promised response to the killing of the Hezbollah commander for
*10:38.560- 10:44.880* :  Chukar in Beirut and the assassination of Ishmael Hanir in Tehran last week. The expectation
*10:44.880- 10:51.320* :  remains that there could be a much bigger assault on Israel still to come involving Iran and
*10:51.320- 10:56.100* :  its different proxies around the region potentially lasting for several days.
*10:56.860- 11:00.860* :  President Biden is set to convene his national security team at the White House.
*11:00.860- 11:05.600* :  What do you think the US can do? I mean certainly a lot is going on diplomatically to try to
*11:05.600- 11:11.060* :  deescalate the situation. There are different allies of the US Arab countries talking to Iran
*11:11.060- 11:15.920* :  urging it to restrain its response. We have the Jordanian Foreign Minister making a rare visit
*11:15.920- 11:22.880* :  to Tehran. The US is reportedly trying to revive the coalition which helped Israel thwart that
*11:22.880- 11:30.860* :  major direct attack from Iran back in April with 300 missiles and attack drones being launched.
*11:30.860- 11:37.640* :  Back then you had the UK, France and Jordan involved in that apparent use of Saudi air space as well.
*11:37.640- 11:43.980* :  The Pentagon has moved extra military resources to this region including an aircraft carrier.
*11:43.980- 11:49.500* :  There have been conversations taking place between senior US military officials and their
*11:49.500- 11:54.980* :  Israeli counterparts. Israel has been coming out saying that it's ready for whatever happens.
*11:54.980- 11:59.420* :  There was this big meeting of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his
*11:59.420- 12:04.180* :  security officials from four hours yesterday looking at Israel's options for response.
*12:04.780- 12:09.060* :  Meanwhile many countries are still pulling their citizens out of the Middle East.
*12:09.640- 12:14.500* :  That's right out of Lebanon in particular with the thought that that could really be on the
*12:14.500- 12:21.680* :  front line if this turns into a wider regional war, a full-scale war. We heard that British
*12:21.680- 12:26.200* :  diplomatic families were withdrawn from Lebanon but one of my colleagues are saying that people
*12:26.200- 12:31.460* :  don't seem to be panicking. Certainly people are leaving. That's the advice that's come through
*12:31.460- 12:36.060* :  from many foreign governments but there isn't panic that's setting in as people try to get some of
*12:36.060- 12:40.560* :  those few remaining flights. There's been a lot of flight disruption around this region as the
*12:40.560- 12:47.300* :  situation has turned into this real fear of a regional escalation. You land now in Jerusalem.
*12:50.140- 12:56.080* :  Still to come in this podcast, I can't even bring my
*12:56.100- 12:59.700* :  off to follow the athletics of these games. It's too painful.
*13:00.280- 13:03.340* :  We bring you the Russian experience of the Olympic Games.
*13:12.900- 13:16.380* :  There was non-propequilla even if you see that the Taliban everybody would say,
*13:16.380- 13:21.680* :  is the killer. This is the story of a man who killed so many people. He lost count.
*13:22.580- 13:26.860* :  But despite his shocking death toll, he only served 12 years in jail.
*13:27.500- 13:31.980* :  It's a standing that anybody could get away with it.
*13:32.260- 13:39.440* :  And the families of his victims want justice. That justice system ultimately ignored all of those
*13:39.440- 13:46.080* :  bodies and all of the families. From the BBC World Service, World of Secrets, Season 3,
*13:46.080- 13:51.880* :  the apartheid killer. Search for World of Secrets wherever you get your BBC podcast.
*13:59.480- 14:06.300* :  In Panama, the sudden closure of a huge open pit copper mine has created a dramatic economic fallout.
*14:06.300- 14:11.360* :  Thousands of jobs have been lost and there's been damage to the country's reputation for investors.
*14:11.420- 14:18.280* :  The mine, Cobra Panama, was shut down by Panama Supreme Court after months of protest against it.
*14:18.800- 14:21.580* :  Jane Chambers has been to Panama to find out more.
*14:22.280- 14:27.380* :  The Canadian mining company, First Quantum Minerals, has invested $10 billion in the Cobra
*14:27.380- 14:31.740* :  Panama mine, which accounts for more than 1% of the world's copper production.
*14:32.520- 14:37.640* :  This is a very swanky part of Panama City. It's called Costa del Este and it's full of
*14:37.640- 14:45.640* :  sky scrapers, very smart offices. I'm on the 23rd floor with stunning views of the sea.
*14:45.820- 14:51.080* :  And I'm about to meet someone called Dolcida de la Guardia who's an ex-finance minister.
*14:52.040- 14:59.580* :  Cobra Panama, it was the most important foreign investment in the country.
*15:00.260- 15:03.940* :  Second to the Panama Canal. What was its contribution?
*15:04.080- 15:10.140* :  5% of GDP, so it's about $5 billion in contributors between direct and indirect.
*15:10.820- 15:15.680* :  But at the end of last year thousands of people took to the streets to protest against the mine.
*15:19.540- 15:23.720* :  They said a new contract was unconstitutional and bad for the environment.
*15:23.720- 15:27.180* :  Bracer Bamfield, an architect and environmental activist,
*15:27.180- 15:32.940* :  says the open pit copper mine threatened water supplies and was harming the country's biodiversity.
*15:33.980- 15:39.140* :  Analysaron el tema de la domina en el contract and realized 12 badad would be for Panama.
*15:39.680- 15:44.760* :  That resulted in its closure by Panama's Supreme Court and the rating's agency Fitch
*15:44.760- 15:47.740* :  stripping the country of its investment grade credit rating.
*15:48.300- 15:51.060* :  But not everyone agrees about the environmental impact.
*15:51.820- 15:54.660* :  There has been a lot of misinformation surrounding the mine.
*15:56.080- 15:59.440* :  You must understand that many people were against the last government.
*16:00.340- 16:04.840* :  That's biologist Samuel Valdes, the owner of the Biodiversity Consultant Group,
*16:04.840- 16:10.620* :  whose work for the mine for the last 14 years. He thinks the mine was closed for political reasons.
*16:11.000- 16:17.300* :  They thought it was corrupt and they started to mistrust the mine's relationship with the mine.
*16:17.420- 16:20.140* :  Many people started to assume things.
*16:25.140- 16:30.220* :  Coverage Panama is currently running the mine with a skeleton staff of 1,400 workers
*16:30.220- 16:35.040* :  instead of the usual 7,000 in the mine. No copper has been extracted.
*16:35.040- 16:38.760* :  But there is copper concentrate sitting waiting to be exported,
*16:38.760- 16:43.620* :  which people like the head of the Panama mining chambers or al morales are worried about.
*16:43.900- 16:49.120* :  It is increasing the risk of having an environmental impact tragedy over there.
*16:49.780- 16:56.900* :  I mean, it is just getting a high temperatures and it's producing some gases.
*16:57.580- 17:01.060* :  And those gases could be dangerous. They could make an explosion.
*17:01.860- 17:04.780* :  First quantum minerals has filed lawsuits against Panama,
*17:04.780- 17:10.040* :  but they've told the BBC that open to dialogue and keen to find a solution with the government.
*17:10.780- 17:14.980* :  Panama's former finance minister, Dolcidio de la Guardia, says the government
*17:14.980- 17:20.120* :  needs to give people some reassurances. He and others in the business community are hopeful
*17:20.120- 17:24.780* :  the new government, which took over in early July, can reach an agreement with the mine
*17:24.780- 17:29.200* :  that panamaniums will support, given how important it is for the economy.
*17:30.020- 17:35.200* :  Change chambers ending that report to listen to more about the Panama mining story search
*17:35.200- 17:38.380* :  for business daily wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:39.600- 17:44.440* :  Traditionally in US elections, it doesn't matter who's the running mate on the presidential ticket.
*17:45.060- 17:51.180* :  However, a vice president herself, Democrat nominee Kamala Harris, is taking her time to choose
*17:51.180- 17:57.220* :  her pick. Knowing the right choice could secure a battleground state or balance the ticket in a way
*17:57.220- 18:02.080* :  that swings enough electoral college votes to win. There are three front runners,
*18:02.080- 18:07.920* :  Senator Mark Kelly and two governors Tim Walsh from Minnesota and Josh Shapiro from Pennsylvania.
*18:07.920- 18:14.940* :  My colleague Justin Webb spoke to Hank Scheinkopf, a long time political strategist for the Democrats.
*18:15.560- 18:19.800* :  They discussed what each would bring to the ticket, starting with Josh Shapiro.
*18:20.420- 18:27.700* :  He is young, he is smart, he is somewhat charismatic, and he hails from a state that is critical
*18:27.700- 18:32.240* :  for the Democrats to win, and if they don't win, it's not likely without Pennsylvania that
*18:32.600- 18:35.420* :  Kamala Harris would be the next president of the United States.
*18:36.560- 18:42.840* :  What in that case is preventing us, simply saying, is him, is so obvious, is so clear that there's
*18:42.840- 18:48.460* :  no reason not to do it. Well, there are many schisms in the Democratic party in the United States,
*18:48.460- 18:54.120* :  which is frankly a more like a bunch of clans than it is a coalition of any coherence.
*18:54.700- 19:00.940* :  Part of Josh Shapiro's problem is frankly that he's Jewish and that the Gaza war is a major problem
*19:00.940- 19:06.120* :  for Democrats and they have a great divide about it, and he's been public about a support for Israel.
*19:06.680- 19:10.560* :  That may be a problem for him. Would it be a problem in the wider nation then?
*19:12.120- 19:17.160* :  Maybe, maybe not among the truthfully among Republicans, and particularly Evangelical Christians,
*19:17.160- 19:21.620* :  it's not a problem at all, because they're strong supporters of the state of Israel, but the Democrats
*19:22.340- 19:26.700* :  have that kind of fissure among the other fissures they have, because they're aligned.
*19:26.700- 19:32.540* :  It's clans. There are loose coalition of ethnic racial groups, different ways of thinking,
*19:33.620- 19:38.160* :  and they can't seem to get united, which is why they need Kamala Harris to get united.
*19:38.420- 19:43.000* :  If she decides against him, she has a choice of a real live astronaut, Mark Kelly.
*19:43.580- 19:49.000* :  Well, Kelly would make a lot more sense, frankly. He is from Arizona, but he's an American hero,
*19:49.000- 19:53.600* :  and Americans, you know, watching Americans, they love heroes, and that's part of it.
*19:53.920- 19:59.220* :  He was an astronaut, and his wife, Gabby Gipperts, was the victim of an attempted assassination
*19:59.800- 20:03.360* :  when she served the United States Congress, leaving her impaired in many ways.
*20:04.000- 20:08.900* :  So that his story is a great story, and Kelly would help her also, because he's a Catholic,
*20:09.480- 20:13.160* :  and people still vote along those kinds of lines. Michigan, heavily Catholic, Arizona,
*20:13.160- 20:18.720* :  Nevada, heavily Catholic, Pennsylvania, heavily Catholic, Wisconsin, heavily Catholic. Those are all
*20:18.720- 20:23.260* :  states that she's got to win, and Kelly would be helpful.
*20:23.860- 20:28.560* :  Which should mention as well, Governor Tim Waltz, who came up, didn't he, on television,
*20:28.560- 20:34.780* :  with this word weird, to describe JD Vance, but also to an extent Donald Trump and the whole
*20:34.780- 20:40.980* :  kind of modern Republican party, which just took off and seems to have catapulted him into the
*20:41.240- 20:47.560* :  front running. Well, he was always a player. The weird thing is really good, because we live in
*20:47.560- 20:53.140* :  a nation today in a world where, in the social media environment, one word can define something,
*20:53.140- 20:58.000* :  where people don't have to say a lot. So weird makes it work for Democrats. He's from a state
*20:58.000- 21:04.420* :  that doesn't have, but would be Democrat voting anyway, but he's from the Midwest of the country,
*21:04.420- 21:10.640* :  United States, and that makes it easier to pick up some states, Wisconsin, Michigan, and potentially
*21:10.640- 21:15.320* :  Pennsylvania, which sees part of itself as being in the Midwest. What do you think she's going to do?
*21:15.920- 21:21.340* :  Hard to say. I mean, I think it's Waltz, and I think it's Waltz or Kelly, I may be dead wrong.
*21:21.340- 21:27.860* :  It just makes more sense. Shapiro creates problems for her, and Kelly or Waltz can potentially help
*21:27.860- 21:33.400* :  bring Pennsylvania. That's simple. Democrat political strategist Hank Scheinkopf speaking to
*21:33.400- 21:39.460* :  Justin Webb. Now to one country you won't find in the Paris Olympics medal table, Russia.
*21:40.000- 21:44.880* :  Its team were banned after the Kremlin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, although
*21:44.880- 21:49.860* :  individual Russian athletes from some sports have been permitted to compete under a neutral flag.
*21:50.540- 21:55.280* :  The games aren't even being televised in Russia, and there's been stinging criticism of the event
*21:55.280- 22:01.440* :  on state media. Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg reports on Moscow's view of the Paris Olympics.
*22:04.700- 22:10.260* :  I'm on a boat sailing down the river with an Olympic champion. No, I'm not on the
*22:10.280- 22:15.820* :  scene, and this is definitely not Paris. Right now, we're passing the Kremlin.
*22:21.780- 22:27.720* :  Below deck, high jumper Maria Lessist-Kene is at the press launch for an unusual event.
*22:27.940- 22:35.520* :  A Russian athletics competition with fashion show and music festival. Maria isn't in Paris,
*22:35.520- 22:40.420* :  defending her Olympic title. Team Russia is barred over the war in Ukraine.
*22:41.280- 22:47.440* :  Track and field stars from Russia aren't even allowed in as neutral athletes, and that hurts.
*22:50.780- 22:57.220* :  I can't even bring myself to follow the athletics at these games. Maria says it's too painful.
*22:57.220- 23:02.200* :  We should be there. The Olympics is the greatest event in the world.
*23:07.260- 23:13.160* :  Not according to Russian state media. After an opening ceremony featuring drag artists,
*23:13.160- 23:20.380* :  and what some saw as a parody of DaVinci's The Last Supper, Russian TV dubbed the Paris Olympics
*23:20.380- 23:27.840* :  Satan's Party. Sour grapes. Not at all. Says Russian MP Maria Bhutina.
*23:28.300- 23:32.460* :  I thought the Olympic Games were about sports, but now it's no longer about sports. It's about
*23:32.460- 23:38.460* :  politics, religion, everything. The original idea of the Olympic Games was to create peace.
*23:38.980- 23:43.660* :  Russia has invaded Ukraine. That's not peace, is it? Russia has been protecting
*23:43.660- 23:51.100* :  their people, and this is normal. You talk about politics, but what about the years of state-sponsored
*23:51.100- 23:57.580* :  doping in Russian sports? What about Russia's invasion of Ukraine? When they exclude Russian sportsman,
*23:57.580- 24:03.420* :  they do play politics. Do you understand why they exclude? If you won the perfect world,
*24:03.420- 24:08.900* :  then everybody should give up their flags, and everybody should just, you know,
*24:08.900- 24:14.420* :  compete in sports. 15 Russians have been competing in Paris as neutral athletes.
*24:14.420- 24:20.560* :  In sports like tennis and canoeing, they've had to go through a vetting procedure to prove they
*24:20.560- 24:26.440* :  have no links to the military or to security agencies and do not support Russia's war in Ukraine.
*24:27.540- 24:31.640* :  For the first time in 40 years, Russian TV isn't showing it.
*24:32.520- 24:40.680* :  Walter Wolf Fighter Vadim doesn't care. I haven't followed the Olympics for ages, Vadim says,
*24:41.460- 24:49.460* :  so what that we can't watch it. Fighting talk from Vadim, but the reality is that Olympic Games
*24:49.460- 24:55.520* :  were always a big deal for Russia and for Russians. The country used to send hundreds of athletes
*24:55.520- 25:01.580* :  to a summer Games. Having no team at the Olympics is a sign of Russia's isolation,
*25:02.620- 25:04.960* :  and it's hard to see a victory in that.
*25:09.460- 25:13.540* :  Steve Rosenborg reporting from Moscow. And finally,
*25:22.820- 25:27.420* :  it's a hundred years since the birth of the American musician Connie Converse.
*25:27.640- 25:31.020* :  Never heard of her? Well, her songs were largely ignored in her time,
*25:31.020- 25:36.600* :  but they've started to be rediscovered in recent years. She's now hailed by some as a great
*25:36.600- 25:43.480* :  lost talent. Lost, not just because her songs got little attention, but also because Connie herself
*25:43.480- 25:50.640* :  suddenly disappeared one week after her 50th birthday. Our culture reporter Ian Young's has her story.
*25:57.180- 26:03.100* :  Connie Converse wrote, talking like you, in 1951, sophisticated, intimate, a little melancholy.
*26:03.440- 26:07.580* :  She was arguably the first of a modern breed of personal and poetic singer-songwriters.
*26:08.200- 26:13.560* :  There's the idea in Connie Converse's songs that we are being taken into the singer's confidence,
*26:14.260- 26:20.420* :  that we are being allowed into a person's inner life into a sort of vulnerability on the part
*26:20.420- 26:26.040* :  of the singer and the narrator. Howard Fisherman who recently wrote a biography of Connie Converse.
*26:26.300- 26:34.740* :  And it has the ability as so many of her songs do to completely draw us in to a different world.
*26:34.740- 26:40.500* :  And this, of course, is ubiquitous today, but at the time that she was doing it,
*26:41.220- 26:42.800* :  nobody was doing this.
*26:53.300- 26:57.940* :  But Connie never got a record deal, and we only have her songs today because a friend,
*26:57.940- 27:03.160* :  the animator Jean Dich, recorded her in his home. And he asked her how she got started.
*27:03.880- 27:10.440* :  I always did the hum things to myself, and when I got to guitar, I was picking up folk songs,
*27:10.440- 27:14.340* :  and then started to make my own little tunes and words.
*27:19.240- 27:24.060* :  Those home recordings were rediscovered 20 years ago, and have since gradually found the audience
*27:24.060- 27:29.780* :  that escaped Connie Converse at the time. British singer Vashdi Bunyan has seen her own music
*27:29.780- 27:34.220* :  rediscovered in recent years, and she's among the Connie Converse converts.
*27:35.120- 27:38.080* :  The one I love of her, it's most, is roving woman.
*27:39.320- 27:43.860* :  But people say a roving woman is likely not to be better than she ought to be.
*27:49.460- 27:55.500* :  It's just wrong true for me. She was completely ahead of her time, and it must have been very hard
*27:55.500- 28:01.360* :  for her, or she must have felt isolated if she had any ambition for her songs. She must have known
*28:02.060- 28:09.960* :  how good they were, but other people didn't seem to recognise that kind of genius writing at the time.
*28:10.540- 28:16.000* :  Connie Converse's songs didn't fit in in the 50s, and neither did she. She gave up on music,
*28:16.420- 28:19.500* :  and became the respected editor of an international peace journal.
*28:20.240- 28:25.600* :  But just after she turned 50 on the 3rd of August 1974, she sent letters to friends and family,
*28:25.600- 28:31.460* :  saying she wanted a fresh start. She left her home in Michigan, and hasn't been heard from since.
*28:32.600- 28:39.220* :  What do I think happened? How can we ever know what happened? I just hope that it wasn't despair
*28:39.260- 28:46.820* :  that sent her away. The Connie Converse story doesn't end with a slow fade. Biographer Howard
*28:46.820- 28:53.560* :  Fishman. It ends with a quick blackout. She has never seen again. And what I always say is,
*28:54.200- 28:59.340* :  don't focus on how she disappeared, focus on how she lived. And I think it's only a matter of
*28:59.340- 29:04.600* :  time before she becomes understood as a major American figure of the 20th century.
*29:12.320- 29:15.200* :  Ian Young's with that report on Connie Converse.
*29:18.400- 29:23.000* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*29:42.780- 29:46.340* :  Martin. I'm Rachel Wright. Until next time. Goodbye.
*30:01.940- 30:08.220* :  This is the story of a man who killed so many people. He lost count. But despite his shocking death
*30:08.220- 30:16.180* :  toll, he only served 12 years in jail. It's a standing that anybody could get away with it.
*30:16.500- 30:23.660* :  And the families of his victims want justice. That justice system ultimately ignored all of those
*30:23.660- 30:30.300* :  bodies and all of the families. From the BBC World Service, World of Secrets, Season 3,
*30:30.300- 30:36.100* :  the apartheid killer. Search for World of Secrets wherever you get your BBC podcast.
