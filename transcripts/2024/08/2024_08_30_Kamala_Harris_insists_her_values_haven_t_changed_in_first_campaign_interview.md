*00:56.600- 01:01.220* :  if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*01:01.640- 01:04.240* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*01:04.240- 01:09.760* :  owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t?

*01:26.320- 01:30.000* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:32.220- 01:36.320* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 30th of August,
*01:36.320- 01:42.480* :  these are our main stories. Kamala Harris says the US is ready to turn the page on Donald Trump
*01:42.480- 01:47.420* :  in her first broadcast interview since winning the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
*01:47.500- 01:51.960* :  Israeli forces say they've killed the Hamas leader and two other Palestinians,
*01:51.960- 01:57.220* :  as they continue their operation in the West Bank for a third consecutive day. We're in Jerusalem
*01:57.220- 02:03.420* :  for the details. Also in this podcast, tributes are paid to New Zealand's Myri King,
*02:03.420- 02:10.520* :  who's died at the age of 69. And Britain's new Prime Minister Kira Starmer relocates a portrait
*02:10.520- 02:15.740* :  of Margaret Thatcher, a predecessor and divisive leader of the opposition conservative party.
*02:16.100- 02:19.620* :  So, what's the reaction of portrait painter Richard Stone?
*02:20.000- 02:24.240* :  If in this circumstance two people looking at the portrait found it unsettling,
*02:24.520- 02:29.060* :  I'd like to think that my portrait of Margaret Thatcher had a presence in that room.
*02:32.440- 02:37.480* :  We start with the US presidential election campaign. Kamala Harris in her first TV
*02:37.480- 02:43.260* :  interview since becoming the Democratic Party nominee sat down alongside her chosen vice presidential
*02:43.260- 02:49.460* :  candidate Tim Walsh on CNN to discuss her bid for the White House, and to fight back against
*02:49.460- 02:55.900* :  the criticism she's faced over the past few weeks. As Harris, whose US vice president defended how
*02:55.900- 03:02.520* :  her policy positions on issues such as immigration and fracking had shifted over time, insisting her
*03:02.520- 03:09.660* :  values have stayed the same. The most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective
*03:09.660- 03:14.420* :  and decisions is my values have not changed. You mentioned the Green New Deal.
*03:16.080- 03:20.900* :  I have always believed, and I have worked on it, that the climate crisis is real,
*03:21.860- 03:27.180* :  that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves
*03:27.920- 03:34.820* :  to deadlines around time. We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for
*03:34.820- 03:39.820* :  the United States of America and by extension the globe around when we should meet certain
*03:39.820- 03:44.620* :  standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Within hours of clips of the interview being
*03:44.620- 03:49.380* :  released, this attack ad was posted by the Trump campaign. My values have not changed.
*03:50.180- 03:53.880* :  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. You know, we have to stay woke.
*03:54.340- 03:59.540* :  Running with the statement, my values have not changed. The video highlighted Harris's pledges
*03:59.540- 04:06.020* :  during the 2020 Democratic primary, including previous commitments to gun control, the elimination
*04:06.020- 04:12.260* :  of private health care and rights for illegal migrants. The Republicans continue to claim that
*04:12.260- 04:17.740* :  Miss Harris is a radical Marxist, but in her interview with CNN she said she wanted to be a
*04:17.740- 04:22.980* :  president for all Americans, and would consider appointing a Republican to her cabinet.
*04:23.480- 04:30.220* :  I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it's important to have people
*04:30.220- 04:35.600* :  at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views,
*04:35.600- 04:40.860* :  different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a
*04:40.860- 04:45.180* :  member of my cabinet who was a Republican. The interview was done following weeks of pressure
*04:45.180- 04:51.280* :  from the Republicans. They've accused the Harris campaign of avoiding media scrutiny. However,
*04:51.280- 04:56.540* :  they've criticised it for being a joint interview with her vice president pick and for being
*04:56.540- 05:03.120* :  pre-recorded rather than live. They say it wasn't a real high stakes moment, with the consequential
*05:03.120- 05:10.020* :  TV debate with Donald Trump looming on the horizon. Jenny Kumar, Republican political consultant
*05:10.020- 05:17.080* :  Barry Dunardieu gave his assessment of the interview. I don't think she gained any votes. I don't
*05:17.080- 05:22.220* :  think she lost any votes either. I think she was just kind of like neutral. I think she struggled
*05:22.220- 05:28.520* :  to answer some of the questions, some of the things relating to immigration, global politics.
*05:28.520- 05:34.680* :  It's just kind of like this neutral, almost like the administration. I saw her talking about a new
*05:34.680- 05:40.240* :  way forward, but she's been in office for three years. So I'm trying to understand what her new way
*05:40.240- 05:47.080* :  forward would be if she's showed, unfortunately, the new way forward of food expenses, gas expenses,
*05:47.080- 05:53.540* :  all rising. That's what really people care about right now. She seemed just unsure of herself,
*05:53.540- 05:57.840* :  quite frankly. The true leader in the room seemed to be, at least by body language,
*05:57.840- 06:03.720* :  was her vice president pick. He seemed to be a lot more sure of his answers and a leadership
*06:04.140- 06:10.320* :  voice. If you listen to her talk, and I'm not trying to be personal, but she kind of has a voice
*06:10.320- 06:16.180* :  that's almost like a whiny voice. Well, we had women talking, they speak more authoritative than she
*06:16.180- 06:22.720* :  does. And I get the fact that it's exciting to have a minority female president, but when that
*06:23.100- 06:28.560* :  luster wears off, is she going to be worthy to be a president of the United States?
*06:29.360- 06:34.520* :  So why did Kamala Harris choose to have vice presidential candidate Tim Walls by her side?
*06:34.520- 06:40.380* :  Amanda Renteria was national political director for Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Party's
*06:40.380- 06:46.820* :  presidential campaign in 2016. I think anyone that looks at her recognizes that she's in charge,
*06:46.820- 06:54.300* :  anyone that watched her DNC speech knows that she's in charge, but what she is doing is her whole
*06:54.300- 07:00.600* :  entire message is about unity. And so it does present differently when it is just her versus both
*07:00.600- 07:06.840* :  of them as a ticket. And I think it actually does help to have the full ticket on display. And what
*07:06.840- 07:13.160* :  she and Walls have done is really introduce themselves as really the full picture of what her
*07:13.160- 07:18.240* :  administration would be of what the Democratic Party would be. When you have a lot of time,
*07:18.240- 07:23.100* :  like Trump does or normal campaigns, you get a chance to not only introduce yourself,
*07:23.180- 07:28.400* :  but then once you name your vice president, you get a chance to also introduce your vice president.
*07:28.920- 07:34.440* :  In this case, they've got to do it both very, very quickly with only, you know, 80-something days
*07:34.440- 07:42.540* :  when they first started. Amanda Renteria and also Adleria, Barry Denario. A major Israeli operation is
*07:42.540- 07:47.980* :  continuing in the West Bank into a third day. As we record this podcast, three Palestinians,
*07:47.980- 07:54.260* :  including a senior local Hamas commander, have been killed. Israel has described raids on towns
*07:54.260- 07:59.300* :  and refugee camps in the northern part of the West Bank as a strategy to counter terrorism.
*07:59.300- 08:02.460* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem Yoranel told us more.
*08:02.900- 08:08.140* :  So this is the third day of what Israel says is its major counterterrorism operation in the north
*08:08.140- 08:13.720* :  of the West Bank. We've actually had more international expressions of concern. The British
*08:13.720- 08:19.360* :  foreign office, calling for Israel to show restraint, saying the risk of instability is serious
*08:19.740- 08:25.700* :  and the need for de-escalation urgent. What the Israeli military says about what's been happening
*08:25.700- 08:31.880* :  on the ground, it says that it killed a local commander of Hamas in Janine and they accused him
*08:31.880- 08:37.100* :  of having been involved in shooting and bombing attacks. Hamas have acknowledged him as a member
*08:37.420- 08:41.220* :  without saying that he was a leader. The Israeli military says that there were two other
*08:41.220- 08:46.420* :  gunmen who were also killed in a drone strike that it carried out on their car this morning.
*08:46.780- 08:52.620* :  Now, Palestinians in Janine have been telling us that they remain very fearful of snipers.
*08:52.620- 08:59.260* :  It remains a very tense situation. This city is now the main focus of Israel's military operation,
*08:59.260- 09:05.800* :  it seems. We heard earlier that troops had pulled out of Tulkram, which has also seen a serious
*09:05.800- 09:11.520* :  offensive and we're still hearing of other raids that happened overnight in Nubless,
*09:11.520- 09:16.640* :  another big city in the north of the West Bank, but this does seem to have reduced in scope.
*09:17.240- 09:20.960* :  But this is the third consecutive day, isn't it? Do we know if it's going to go on?
*09:21.220- 09:27.460* :  They have only said the army that they would continue this for several days and they're
*09:27.960- 09:35.240* :  not giving that many updates, perhaps not surprisingly, on exactly what their movements and plans are.
*09:35.720- 09:41.400* :  I mean, Palestinian officials have been coming out warning that what is happening is very dangerous.
*09:41.400- 09:46.980* :  They're complaining about the effects that this is all having on people's freedom to move,
*09:46.980- 09:53.540* :  how it's ratcheting up tensions, how it's having a knock-on effect, particularly on the healthcare
*09:53.540- 09:57.640* :  with hospitals that have been very affected by what's going on.
*09:58.040- 10:04.280* :  And of course, Yuland, this is coming as a mass polio vaccination program is planned for this
*10:04.280- 10:07.860* :  weekend with a pause in hostilities agreed by both sides.
*10:09.120- 10:13.640* :  That's correct. And I've been talking to Yuland officials, they've told me this will be a huge
*10:13.640- 10:20.020* :  challenge, but they think that their plan is doable. Already they do have the polio vaccine
*10:20.020- 10:26.020* :  in cold storage in a warehouse in Gaza, but now they found a virus in the environment and in this
*10:26.020- 10:32.840* :  one baby who was partly paralyzed. They say that to stop transmission, they have to reach 90% of
*10:32.840- 10:38.380* :  all children aged under 10 and they have to do it in a very short time frame. Yuland El,
*10:39.140- 10:43.840* :  the Japanese are known for having a high life expectancy, but it seems to have come at a cost.
*10:43.900- 10:49.980* :  Statistics released by the Japanese police show that nearly 40,000 Japanese people died alone
*10:49.980- 10:55.260* :  in their homes in the first half of this year, highlighting the growing problem of loneliness and
*10:55.260- 11:00.320* :  isolation in a country with an increasing number of elderly people. Mickey Bristol has more.
*11:00.820- 11:06.200* :  The figures released by the police show the vast numbers of people in Japan who live and die alone.
*11:06.940- 11:13.380* :  Perhaps the most stark figure is that from January to June, 4,000 people went unmist and unfound
*11:13.420- 11:19.880* :  for a month after dying at home. 130 had been dead for at least a year before discovery.
*11:20.660- 11:25.240* :  In April, the Japanese government introduced a bill aimed at tackling the growing problem of
*11:25.240- 11:32.360* :  loneliness and isolation, partly caused by Japan's aging society, a demographic shift that's
*11:32.360- 11:38.540* :  getting harder to manage. Mickey Bristol, weeks after the new British Prime Minister Kiyostama
*11:38.540- 11:43.400* :  moved into number 10 Dining Street, his efforts to redecorate seem to be well underway,
*11:43.420- 11:48.600* :  relocating a portrait of one of his predecessors, the conservative leader Margaret Thatcher,
*11:48.940- 11:53.800* :  apparently because he found it unsettling. But the move has angered some conservatives.
*11:53.800- 11:59.240* :  Here's our correspondent, Lily Nathoo. This is a portrait of Margaret Thatcher that has been
*11:59.240- 12:05.820* :  hanging in Downing Street and apparently according to Tom Baldwin who's a biographer of Kiyostama
*12:05.820- 12:10.440* :  wrote a very hefty book detailing him and according to him he had a conversation with Kiyostama
*12:10.440- 12:17.000* :  about this picture in the room that it hung and Kiyostama agreed that he didn't like it and he was
*12:17.220- 12:22.020* :  going to take it out of that room and he since confirmed that he said that it's actually hanging
*12:22.020- 12:26.720* :  somewhere else in that building or at least it plans to. So Kiyostama clearly moving around
*12:26.720- 12:31.100* :  the artwork in number 10 as he finds his feet there. So what does the painter of the portrait
*12:31.100- 12:39.340* :  Richard Stone think about it? I see it as something of a compliment in a way because my sense of
*12:39.340- 12:46.140* :  judging a good portrait when looking at a painted portrait, if you sense you're in the presence of
*12:46.140- 12:53.000* :  that person then you know it starts ticking boxes for me and if in this circumstance two people
*12:53.000- 12:58.920* :  looking at the portrait found it unsettling well then I like to think that my portrait of Margaret
*12:58.920- 13:06.280* :  Thatcher had a presence in that room and in fact one of the most memorable comments I have ever
*13:06.280- 13:15.240* :  received from any sitter was from Lady Thatcher when she saw the finished picture she likely touched
*13:15.240- 13:21.020* :  the pearls at her throat and was thinking of something appropriate to say and with a little
*13:21.100- 13:30.320* :  break in her voice she said it is how one would wish to be remembered. Richard Stone on Margaret Thatcher
*13:32.460- 13:38.580* :  still to come out region Italy after Heinz launches its version of spaghetti carbonara in a can.
*13:44.940- 13:46.380* :  Blito pasta.
*13:54.160- 13:58.560* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Midmobile with the price of just about everything going up during inflation
*13:58.560- 14:04.140* :  we thought we'd bring our prices down so to help us we brought in a reverse auctioneer which is
*14:04.140- 14:08.840* :  apparently a thing. Midmobile unlimited premium wireless. Have it to get 30, 30, 30, 30, 30,
*14:08.840- 14:15.080* :  20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, just 15 bucks a month. So give it a try at
*14:15.080- 14:20.580* :  midmobile.com slash switch. $45 up from payment to equivalent to $15 for month new customers on

*14:24.480- 14:30.900* :  You've heard of Charlie Chaplin right? Well Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather and there was a time
*14:30.900- 14:38.280* :  when he was the biggest star in all the world but something happened not just to him but to hundreds
*14:38.280- 14:45.320* :  of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave forced out. All episodes of Hollywood

*14:52.220- 14:53.200* :  you get your podcasts.
*15:00.540- 15:05.540* :  The far right could be on the cusp of winning the most votes in German state elections for the
*15:05.540- 15:10.980* :  first time since the Nazi party back in the 1930s. This weekend alternative for Deutschland
*15:10.980- 15:17.280* :  looks set to come out top in the eastern state of Turinja and possibly in neighbouring Saxony too.
*15:17.280- 15:21.940* :  It comes after last week's knife attack in Germany fueled anti-government feeling.
*15:21.940- 15:28.220* :  The man detained as a Syrian asylum seeker and suspected Islamist. Arbor Lin correspondent Jessica
*15:28.220- 15:33.060* :  Parker reports now from Turinja to find out why people are supporting the AFD.
*15:35.540- 15:36.920* :  All of Schultz.
*15:39.840- 15:46.340* :  Buz cut through a politer clause for Chancellor Olaf Schultz. He's on stage in Yena,
*15:46.540- 15:53.440* :  the Ringer's second city. This state is a stronghold for the far right alternative for Deutschland.
*15:58.720- 16:03.580* :  Chancellor Schultz has not been very visible during this campaign. He's not exactly seen as an
*16:03.580- 16:07.160* :  electoral asset. And the reception here is mixed.
*16:12.760- 16:16.220* :  An argument breaks out between a supporter of alternative for Deutschland,
*16:16.220- 16:19.040* :  Ralph and a passionate opponent, Leonard.
*16:23.840- 16:27.840* :  Yes, absolutely they say it's the one thing they can agree on.
*16:30.280- 16:35.180* :  In a town on the edge of the Touring of Old Forest, people sit in the shade sipping beer.
*16:35.640- 16:39.460* :  Various party campaign stalls have popped up here in Schmalkaldon,
*16:39.880- 16:46.140* :  but across much of Germany's former communist east, it is the far right now topping the poles.
*16:48.480- 16:55.280* :  As sausages is along the grill in this sunny market square, what's driving this discontent?
*16:55.840- 17:02.220* :  Well, there's angst about a range of issues from immigration to Germany sending weapons to Ukraine,
*17:02.220- 17:07.960* :  a deep frustration with the parties that have governed this country since reunification
*17:07.960- 17:14.900* :  and an oring dissatisfaction about what reunification has delivered or hasn't delivered for the
*17:14.940- 17:15.780* :  people of East Germany.
*17:19.520- 17:24.180* :  Mistakes were made with the reunification. The western system was forced on the East Germans.
*17:25.400- 17:29.240* :  Birgit's an AFD activist, out campaigning ahead of Sunday's vote.
*17:34.440- 17:36.860* :  No one wants to be called right-wing extremist on Nazis,
*17:37.620- 17:41.480* :  but the AFD has nothing at all to do with right-wing extremism.
*17:42.280- 17:43.680* :  We are about conservative politics.
*17:48.340- 17:52.020* :  More arguments, this time at an AFD campaign stand in Minergan.
*17:52.440- 17:58.740* :  The AFD's classed in this state by domestic intelligence as right-wing extremist,
*17:59.160- 18:06.400* :  many view it as an anti-migrant, neo-fascist movement, even an existential threat to modern Germany.
*18:06.400- 18:11.740* :  But Constantine, a trainee car mechanic, says other parties have failed the East.
*18:11.940- 18:15.340* :  You can constantly see where the East begins and where the West begins.
*18:15.440- 18:19.840* :  Better infrastructure, better industry, it's we are getting like forgotten.
*18:20.480- 18:28.000* :  The AFD, as you all know, faces accusations of being an extremist party with extremist people
*18:28.000- 18:33.480* :  within it. If you really see it, you see that the AFD is really trying to do something,
*18:33.520- 18:39.340* :  and not just saying, yeah, we do it, we do it, and then nothing changes. Yeah, I believe in it.
*18:42.020- 18:46.760* :  Constantine rides off on his S-50s Simpson classic East German moped.
*18:47.360- 18:52.860* :  His words are echoed by many in the East, a tale of two countries in one.
*18:56.680- 18:57.940* :  Jessica Parker reporting,
*18:58.840- 19:04.380* :  M-pox vaccines arrived in Africa this week. Nigeria received 10,000 doses which were
*19:04.380- 19:08.720* :  ordered before the outbreak. There are calls to speed up the international response,
*19:08.720- 19:15.520* :  as 615 people have already died and were then 18,000 as suspected of contracted the disease
*19:15.520- 19:20.600* :  mostly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The World Health Organization has announced a
*19:20.600- 19:26.460* :  six-month plan to curb the spread of M-pox. James Coppnell spoke to its regional director for Africa,
*19:26.860- 19:31.580* :  Dr. Matsy Diso Maite, who's about to leave the job after almost 10 years.
*19:32.280- 19:37.360* :  What I do see is the situation that's unprecedented in terms of the number of cases,
*19:38.160- 19:42.680* :  particularly the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Eastern part of the DRC,
*19:43.100- 19:47.760* :  and new countries that are affected for East African countries are newly affected.
*19:48.300- 19:51.960* :  And this is building on what was happening in the global outbreak in 2022,
*19:51.960- 19:56.540* :  among many who have sex with men. It was seen as a situation where there seems to be
*19:56.540- 20:02.200* :  faster spread, much more severe illness, broader groups, young children, as well as young adults
*20:02.200- 20:07.860* :  affected, and sexual transmission seems to be important there. But what we're also seeing is
*20:08.500- 20:13.840* :  a determined mobilization by the countries and partners. We've already developed
*20:13.840- 20:18.340* :  working with the Africa CDC, a continental plan, and indeed we are working together
*20:18.780- 20:23.540* :  to go and look for the resources to support our member states to respond to this outbreak.
*20:23.860- 20:27.960* :  And we are hoping very much that the experiences that have occurred before in terms of
*20:28.300- 20:33.200* :  availability of tools will be different. I believe the fact that we've already started seeing
*20:33.200- 20:39.080* :  a case in Europe, a case in Asia will underline the shared vulnerability of the world,
*20:39.080- 20:44.560* :  and hopefully encourage a shared response where equity is emphasized.
*20:44.560- 20:50.080* :  What are the major challenges you have faced as a WHO regional director for Africa,
*20:50.420- 20:55.740* :  as you look back on the last decade? I started my job during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa,
*20:56.600- 21:01.600* :  and then halfway through my term was the COVID-19 pandemic. Now there's
*21:02.520- 21:07.060* :  as well as measles outbreaks, because of course, one of the things we don't emphasize is the
*21:07.500- 21:13.820* :  impact of COVID-19 on health in general, going well beyond the specific cases.
*21:14.360- 21:19.920* :  We've had measles outbreaks in about 13 countries in Africa with over 60,000 children having died.
*21:19.920- 21:25.180* :  You know, we need to put, let us put the impacts in perspective. One of the biggest challenges
*21:25.840- 21:30.160* :  has been these disease outbreaks, but I'm very glad that we've improved the capacity of our countries
*21:30.160- 21:34.240* :  to detect outbreaks quicker and close them down sooner.
*21:38.560- 21:44.300* :  In Brazil, an ongoing legal ride between Elon Musk's social media side X and the authorities
*21:44.300- 21:49.360* :  there is expected to end with the platform being banned in the country. Via tweets, Mr
*21:49.360- 21:54.420* :  Musk accused a Brazilian Supreme Court judge of censorship and of being an evil dictator.
*21:54.420- 21:58.720* :  After he set a deadline for X to name a new legal representative,
*21:58.720- 22:03.580* :  would it fail to do? The Supreme Court also blocked the local bank accounts of Mr
*22:03.580- 22:08.360* :  Musk's Starlink satellite internet firm, which is used by the Brazilian military.
*22:09.040- 22:11.720* :  Our business reporter Pierre Antoine Denis has more details.
*22:12.460- 22:20.020* :  This goes back quite a long way, right? We are in the run-up to the 2022 election in Brazil,
*22:20.020- 22:26.360* :  and the Supreme Court judge Alexander de Mouraix is on the campaign against this information,
*22:26.360- 22:33.400* :  and so he wants certain accounts on X that are spreading misinformation according to his ruling
*22:33.940- 22:38.760* :  to be closed. So he's pushing these certain accounts that are linked to what he calls
*22:38.760- 22:45.400* :  digital militia to be closed, and Elon Musk, as he was already owning X or formerly Twitter,
*22:45.840- 22:52.080* :  is challenging that decision after months and months of discussion, then the judge Alexander de
*22:52.080- 22:58.160* :  Mouraix decides to launch an inquiry into Elon Musk's businesses. Why? Because according to
*22:58.160- 23:03.220* :  Brazilian law and according to the ruling from the Supreme Court judges Alexander de Mouraix,
*23:03.220- 23:08.840* :  companies that are not respecting local laws could face temporary suspensions of their activities.
*23:08.840- 23:15.040* :  X has recently closed their operations in Brazil due to censorship orders fired most of the
*23:15.040- 23:20.620* :  staff across Latin America. The service still is available for Brazilian users. Why is he fired
*23:20.620- 23:25.480* :  everyone is because he's saying that Mouraix himself secretly threatened one of the legal
*23:25.480- 23:32.080* :  representatives with arrest if the company didn't comply with this content removal orders. So for Elon
*23:32.080- 23:39.200* :  Musk, this is his big fight that is on for quite some time now about censorship against moderation,
*23:39.200- 23:44.100* :  propaganda, and about how he believes his platform is the best one for the freedom of expression.
*23:45.060- 23:51.260* :  It is complicated, a legally complicated issue, but Pierre, what does it mean for consumers
*23:51.260- 23:57.620* :  in Brazil? Does it mean that you won't be able to access say X? Yes, so as of now as we're
*23:57.620- 24:04.820* :  speaking, indeed, X is still working, is still operating, but funnily enough, the the top
*24:04.820- 24:11.940* :  trending hashtag is Twitter is dead, because everyone is wondering when not if it will end up
*24:11.940- 24:18.640* :  eventually being blocked. According to market research, one in five Brazilians so I estimated to be
*24:19.040- 24:25.920* :  using X on a monthly basis, so that's quite the market. You have to remember that the the the
*24:25.920- 24:33.100* :  CEO of X is in a legal battle of himself against advertiser to try and get more money into the
*24:33.100- 24:38.100* :  company. So he would actually really welcome the fact that all across the world X would be working
*24:38.140- 24:43.100* :  and running smoothly so that he can get this advertising money in, but when he comes to Brazilians,
*24:43.100- 24:49.820* :  yes, indeed, it might mean that very, very soon there will not be able to access X and for the
*24:50.180- 24:54.380* :  for the time being and will never know when he's going to end. Pierre Antoine Didi
*24:55.280- 24:59.420* :  tributes have been paid to the Maury King of New Zealand, who's died at the age of 69,
*24:59.420- 25:06.220* :  just days after celebrating the 18th anniversary of his coronation. King Tahitia was the seventh
*25:06.220- 25:12.120* :  in line of a Maury Kingdom founded back in 1858 and had been recovering in hospital from a heart
*25:12.120- 25:18.820* :  operation. Maury's account for 18% of New Zealand's five million people and the King had been at the
*25:18.820- 25:25.580* :  forefront of uniting the many Maury tribes. Mike McRoberts is the Maury editor of New Zealand's
*25:25.580- 25:31.540* :  National Business Review. He was a very humble man. I think he he actually was a track driver before
*25:31.660- 25:39.660* :  he he took the throne as so to speak as the Maury King when his mother died and he was in touch
*25:39.660- 25:46.100* :  with what was going on and he came to prominence really in this this past year or so when there
*25:46.100- 25:51.540* :  had been a lot of trouble between Maury Demons, the coalition government with some of their proposals
*25:51.540- 25:57.960* :  and he had this wonderful way of unifying the nation. He put on Huia Mautu, which is basically a
*25:57.960- 26:04.540* :  meeting for the nation. 10,000 people turned up to his home at Turanga Wai Wai in January. I was there
*26:05.180- 26:11.660* :  and was amazed to see just the Kortahi Tungar or the togetherness that he brought to that meeting
*26:11.840- 26:16.540* :  and that continued on throughout the year. I got to spend some time with him and was really
*26:16.540- 26:21.820* :  impressed with the person that he was. I said today in a piece that I wrote that he was an
*26:21.820- 26:27.020* :  instigator for Maury, not an agitated. So he's burned some of the more radical ideas that have come
*26:27.020- 26:31.560* :  out of some of these meetings, things like an independent Maury Parliament. It was very much a
*26:31.740- 26:37.360* :  moderator and tried to inspire people to to work with the government that we have at the moment
*26:38.140- 26:44.160* :  and and one of his favourite sayings was if you're worried about anti-Maury, then just be Maury
*26:44.160- 26:50.440* :  all day every day. Mike McRoberts, Maury Editor of New Zealand's National Business Review.
*26:51.380- 26:55.460* :  History was made on the first day of the Paralympic Games in Paris on Thursday.
*26:55.460- 27:01.140* :  Zakia Kudadadi, who was born in Afghanistan, became the first athlete from the refugee team to
*27:01.140- 27:07.300* :  win a medal. Kudadadi, who was born without a forearm, took bronze in Taekwondo and dedicated her
*27:07.300- 27:14.060* :  medal to all the women in Afghanistan and all refugees. She's one of an eight strong refugee
*27:14.060- 27:19.740* :  team in Paris whose chef-demission is the Zimbabwean former Paralympic wheelchair tennis player
*27:19.740- 27:26.440* :  Nyasha Maharakowa. Nishat Lada asked him how difficult it's been to get the refugee competitors
*27:26.440- 27:33.860* :  to the starting line at these games. It's definitely not easy. Parasport in general is not
*27:33.860- 27:41.560* :  that well-funded globally and if you now a par-athlete who is also a refugee, where you are in a country
*27:41.560- 27:47.660* :  where it's not your country of origin or home country if you can put it that way, you don't necessarily
*27:47.900- 27:54.200* :  get the support that you need at a local level to prepare you to a point where you end up being
*27:54.200- 27:59.840* :  ready for the games. And I'm intrigued to know what the atmosphere is like in the refugee team
*27:59.840- 28:05.280* :  because you'll have people who are speaking different languages who've come from different cultures.
*28:05.280- 28:12.260* :  So how do you foster that sense of team? That's a very good question and I must say it is
*28:12.260- 28:17.680* :  going much better than we thought because to be honest, it was one of the many points that
*28:17.680- 28:23.680* :  we wondered a lot. These are a group of people that come from different countries that speak
*28:23.680- 28:29.920* :  different languages that they probably have never met and if you compare that to any other team
*28:29.920- 28:35.920* :  that is in these games, typically at least they're something that is similar, which is where you come
*28:35.920- 28:41.640* :  from. When we arrive at the training camp, we already saw a lot of excitement and willingness
*28:41.640- 28:47.340* :  to understand that this is a team and in the words of one of the athletes, this is more than a team
*28:47.400- 28:51.880* :  and this is according to Ibrahim, one of the athletes who is doing paratroopers. You see, this is a
*28:51.880- 28:58.640* :  family and if I think of the activities and the jokes and the fun that we have had not just
*28:58.640- 29:05.220* :  for the athletes only, but the coaches and the support staff in a very short space of time
*29:05.300- 29:11.100* :  is really been amazing. They have found a way not just to be able to move in and become part of
*29:11.100- 29:17.140* :  a new community, but to find a place to be able to try out and train and compete in sport,
*29:17.820- 29:22.660* :  which, under no circumstances, you would almost take that as a luxury if you were in a situation
*29:22.660- 29:28.720* :  where you were to flee to flee your home country. For me, this is really something that I look at
*29:28.720- 29:34.760* :  them and I see the amount of courage and the amount of positivity and the vision that they have
*29:34.760- 29:39.180* :  to say regardless of my situation I need to focus and make sure that I move forward.
*29:40.180- 29:41.680* :  Niasha Mahara Kurwa
*29:42.580- 29:47.360* :  Now to end this podcast, something new to appeal to Jen Zed, food shoppers,
*29:47.920- 29:52.780* :  but is it the end of culinary civilization or the kind of leap forward that brought us
*29:52.780- 29:59.380* :  instant noodles and microwave meals? Heinz is selling spaghetti carbonara in a can,
*29:59.380- 30:03.380* :  much to the horror of many Italians and your Aslam reports.
*30:04.040- 30:08.680* :  As the company that brought us spaghetti hoops, alphabetti and Minions-shaped pasta,
*30:09.180- 30:14.520* :  Heinz is not afraid to take liberties with Italian cuisine. Its newest offering hopes to take
*30:14.520- 30:20.480* :  the drama out of cooking a classic, the carbonara. The $2 tin lets you enjoy a comforting meal in
*30:20.480- 30:25.760* :  minutes and it didn't take long to convince the food expert Harry Wallop. There is a very long
*30:25.760- 30:31.840* :  history of spaghetti in a tin. In fact, spaghetti in a tin goes back further than carbonara itself.
*30:31.840- 30:39.040* :  Carbonara is a very modern recipe. It's dated only as far back as the 1950s or 1940s if we're
*30:39.040- 30:46.520* :  pushing it. It's a modern invention, whereas Heinz has been putting pasta in a tin since 1930.
*30:46.520- 30:51.200* :  Heinz, which has already given the same treatment as spaghetti bolognese and beef ravioli,
*30:51.200- 30:55.620* :  says tin carbonara is the perfect fuss-free dinner, especially for young people.
*30:56.020- 31:00.440* :  Research shows a third of Jen Zed consumers want their food to be both fast and convenient,
*31:00.440- 31:05.060* :  but many Italians are horrified at the latest viral innovation of their cuisine.
*31:05.360- 31:09.320* :  Why don't they stick Heinz baked beans?
*31:09.660- 31:15.220* :  The yellow and pink cans been called everything under the sun, a disgrace, an insult, an abomination,
*31:15.220- 31:19.940* :  and just sad and beige. Andreas Karpati is an Italian chef.
*31:20.300- 31:25.800* :  Carbonara is such a traditional dish in Rome, in Italy. You're only in the full symbol
*31:25.800- 31:32.320* :  ingredient to make a great plate of pasta. And just because the denugeration
*31:33.180- 31:38.780* :  hasn't got time, or they can't be bothered cooking or spend time on the table with the family and
*31:38.780- 31:45.640* :  friends, they must have some kind of tin food, which it can only arm your health.
*31:46.020- 31:51.400* :  Undeterred Heinz, the culinary mastermind behind the TikTok inspired pickle ketchup and the
*31:51.400- 31:56.620* :  14th flavor every sauce will begin stocking the shelves with carbonara and a can later this year.
*31:57.340- 32:01.680* :  But if you want to walk past the tins in the grocery store and try making the classic dish by
*32:01.680- 32:07.300* :  yourself, it's a fairly simple recipe. The carbonara, you only ask for simple ingredients
*32:07.300- 32:12.120* :  called guanciale. You need obviously the pasta, which usually I do address them with the
*32:12.380- 32:17.360* :  oregano, or you can do with spaghetti. Roman pecorino cheese, black pepper, and egg yolk.
*32:18.060- 32:23.300* :  You get the crispy guanciale, put on the side, then get the fatties in a pan, you mix with the
*32:23.300- 32:28.240* :  egg and pecorino. And then once the pasta is cooked, you've got a plate of carbonara.
*32:28.880- 32:34.320* :  Mamma mia, Italian chef Andrea Scarpatti ending that report by Anya Aslam.
*32:36.520- 32:40.400* :  And that's it for us for now, but there'll be a new addition of the global news podcast later.
*32:40.400- 32:46.280* :  But just before we go, we're planning a special program in Montreal in Canada next month
*32:46.280- 32:51.100* :  at the one young world summit where young people from across the world gather to share their
*32:51.100- 32:56.580* :  solutions to global issues. And for that, we'd like to know what question you would put to a group of
*32:56.580- 33:02.520* :  young people setting out to change the world. It could be about the environment, world peace, AI,
*33:02.520- 33:09.200* :  or any other issue. You can send us an email at globalpodcast at BBC.co.uk and you can also
*33:09.200- 33:15.080* :  find us on X at Global NewsPod. This addition was mixed by Chris Casaris, the producer was Tracey
*33:15.080- 33:19.660* :  Gordon, the editor is Karen Martin. I'm Valerie Sanderson, till next time, bye bye.
*33:28.340- 33:33.160* :  We've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right? Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather,
*33:33.180- 33:39.320* :  and there was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world. But something happened,
*33:39.420- 33:46.860* :  not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave, forced out.
*33:47.920- 33:53.400* :  All episodes of Hollywood Exiles from the BBC World Service and CBC are available now.
