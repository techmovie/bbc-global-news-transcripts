*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:08.740* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week.
*00:09.200- 00:12.620* :  BBC World Service Podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:16.260- 00:16.960* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*00:16.960- 00:20.920* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*00:21.120- 00:23.580* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*00:23.900- 00:28.040* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*00:28.040- 00:31.300* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*00:31.580- 00:36.580* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*00:37.000- 00:39.500* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.
*00:39.760- 00:42.760* :  $45 upfront for three months plus taxes and fees, promoting for new customers for limited
*00:42.760- 00:45.780* :  time, unlimited more than 40 gigabytes per month, slows, full turns at MintMobile.com.
*00:46.460- 00:49.800* :  This season, Instacart has your back to school.
*00:50.460- 00:55.160* :  As in, they've got your back to school lunch favorites, like snack packs and fresh fruit,
*00:55.600- 00:59.980* :  and they've got your back to school supplies, like backpacks, binders and pencils.
*01:00.860- 01:06.520* :  And they've got your back when your kid casually tells you they have a huge school project
*01:06.520- 01:07.740* :  to do tomorrow.
*01:08.420- 01:10.640* :  Let's face it, we were all that kid.
*01:11.240- 01:17.440* :  So first, call your parents to say I'm sorry and then download the Instacart app to get
*01:17.440- 01:20.900* :  delivery in as fast as 30 minutes all school year long.
*01:21.400- 01:26.060* :  It is zero dollar delivery fee with your first three orders while supplies last, minimum
*01:26.060- 01:28.500* :  $10 in order, additional term supply.
*01:31.760- 01:34.260* :  This is the happy part from the BBC World Service.
*01:39.340- 01:44.220* :  I'm Nick Miles and in this edition, uploaded on Saturday the 3rd of August, a new blood
*01:44.220- 01:47.940* :  test that could revolutionize the diagnosis of Alzheimer's.
*01:47.960- 01:53.520* :  It will affect one in five women and one in ten men, and it's a disease which is very
*01:53.520- 01:57.440* :  difficult to recognise just based on clinical symptoms.
*01:57.800- 02:00.100* :  It's hoped it will lead to earlier treatment.
*02:00.760- 02:06.160* :  How platypus rescue HQ hopes to help the animals have more babies or puggles?
*02:06.220- 02:10.800* :  Unfortunately for the poor platypus, their population in the wild is in decline.
*02:10.900- 02:16.800* :  We also have very few platypus in zoo settings, and there's such a mark on ex-species.
*02:17.660- 02:24.480* :  Pretty surreal, I don't think that a lot of people really grasp how lucky I am, just like
*02:24.980- 02:27.120* :  what a long shot it was from the beginning.
*02:27.680- 02:32.980* :  The 50 year old Olympic skateboarder taking on the teenagers, also in this podcast.
*02:33.240- 02:40.360* :  Both the emails were strange because they both mentioned we loved your story and it was
*02:40.360- 02:42.840* :  a very good question for our exam.
*02:43.500- 02:50.060* :  Now one travel blogger found fame in China and the seagull banned from a shop after a six
*02:56.800- 02:56.860* :  year crime spree.
*02:56.880- 03:01.820* :  We start with a medical discovery which it's hoped could help the millions of people around
*03:01.820- 03:04.740* :  the world who develop Alzheimer's disease every year.
*03:05.400- 03:10.760* :  At the moment it can only be confirmed by expensive brain scans which can be hard to interpret
*03:11.240- 03:15.520* :  or a lumber puncture sticking a needle into a person's spine.
*03:16.180- 03:21.660* :  But early results suggest a blood test can diagnose the disease with greater accuracy
*03:21.660- 03:22.740* :  than scans.
*03:23.320- 03:28.520* :  And it can detect the onset of Alzheimer's five to ten years before symptoms start or
*03:28.520- 03:34.020* :  even twenty years for some people with genetic mutations which is crucial given current
*03:34.020- 03:37.180* :  treatments can only slow the disease, not cure it.
*03:37.800- 03:44.660* :  Sebastian Poundquist is an associate professor at Lund University and a consultant neurologist
*03:44.860- 03:47.320* :  at Skonya University Hospital in Sweden.
*03:47.460- 03:52.980* :  He worked on the study led by Oscar Hansen and spoke to the happy pods Holly Gibbs.
*03:53.740- 03:57.760* :  The blood test for Alzheimer's disease it's very important because Alzheimer's disease
*03:57.760- 03:59.240* :  it's a very common disease.
*03:59.920- 04:05.880* :  It will affect one in five women and one in ten men so it's common and it's very devastating
*04:05.880- 04:11.020* :  for the patient, for those living around the patient and for the healthcare system.
*04:11.020- 04:16.660* :  It's actually the world's most expensive disease and it's a disease which is fairly difficult
*04:16.660- 04:19.960* :  to recognize just based on clinical symptoms.
*04:20.700- 04:26.000* :  So a blood test has the potential possibility to really revolutionize the diagnostic workup
*04:26.000- 04:26.920* :  of Alzheimer's disease.
*04:27.260- 04:30.980* :  What was your reaction when you realized you'd found a test that worked so well?
*04:31.500- 04:39.580* :  I mean that was amazing and actually the journey started in 2019 and 2020 when we had our
*04:39.580- 04:46.020* :  first major publication on this showing that this specific blood test seemed to be very accurate.
*04:46.680- 04:52.980* :  But back then we only showed it on specific research populations that were quite selected
*04:53.620- 04:57.560* :  and we had no idea how it would actually work in clinical practice.
*04:57.560- 04:59.680* :  That's I would say the major step forward.
*05:00.000- 05:04.220* :  Tell us what a difference this could make in terms of an earlier diagnosis and therefore
*05:04.220- 05:05.700* :  treatment of Alzheimer's.
*05:06.160- 05:13.400* :  One thing it can help is to rule out Alzheimer's disease early on help the maybe the primary care
*05:13.400- 05:16.100* :  physician realize that this is not Alzheimer's disease.
*05:16.560- 05:21.060* :  I need to focus and try to identify other causes of the memory impairment.
*05:21.060- 05:25.600* :  Maybe it's depression, maybe it's on more benign condition and that can be really helpful.
*05:25.600- 05:31.540* :  The other alternative is if it's positive and could support an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis
*05:31.580- 05:36.500* :  that could help the physician and the patient really understand what's going on.
*05:37.180- 05:39.280* :  Provide the right care, the right treatment.
*05:39.280- 05:45.160* :  In the new era of disease modifying treatments it can help the patient start treatment
*05:45.160- 05:47.940* :  earlier and maybe have a better disease modifying effect.
*05:48.260- 05:50.560* :  And how soon could the blood test be rolled out?
*05:50.840- 05:58.840* :  What we need in place first is proper guidelines on whom to test and what to do with the test results.
*05:58.840- 06:04.740* :  Those guidelines are pretty much in place in specialist care in memory clinics
*06:04.740- 06:10.680* :  but the challenge is primary care and the problem is that most primary care physicians are not
*06:10.680- 06:13.260* :  used to working with Alzheimer biomarkers.
*06:13.260- 06:15.760* :  There we need education and clear guidelines.
*06:16.280- 06:20.300* :  Why is it so important for patients in their quality of life to get an earlier diagnosis
*06:20.300- 06:21.340* :  of Alzheimer's?
*06:21.660- 06:24.000* :  Most patients want to know.
*06:24.320- 06:26.700* :  You notice that you're not working properly.
*06:27.200- 06:29.140* :  The memory is not functioning the way it used to.
*06:29.140- 06:31.280* :  Most people just want to know what is this.
*06:31.280- 06:37.240* :  The next step is that you could initiate symptomatic treatment that are currently available.
*06:37.940- 06:43.580* :  Provide information about the disease, set up correct care and support in their home
*06:43.580- 06:44.900* :  so they can function better.
*06:45.160- 06:50.200* :  And as we've seen in many countries where there are now these new anti-amaloid treatment
*06:50.200- 06:54.940* :  that are disease modifying and slow the progression with about 30 to 40 percent,
*06:54.940- 06:58.500* :  that could also be initiated to slow down the progress.
*06:58.940- 07:03.620* :  How does it feel to know that you could make such a difference to so many people in their families?
*07:04.160- 07:10.960* :  I mean, of course this is a great first step and it's really a team effort and we're all
*07:10.960- 07:12.280* :  very happy about this.
*07:12.800- 07:17.420* :  The first but promising step, this is what we've been working for many many years.
*07:17.520- 07:20.660* :  So it's happy to see that it's finally coming through like this.
*07:21.280- 07:24.020* :  That was Sebastian Palmquist, talking to Holly Gibbs.
*07:25.360- 07:29.700* :  Now, imagine waking up to discover you'd become famous among teenagers,
*07:30.520- 07:32.720* :  thousands of kilometers away from where you live.
*07:33.360- 07:37.560* :  Well, that's what happened to a travel blogger who grew up in India and is now based in Germany.
*07:37.980- 07:42.580* :  After one of his stories was included in China's university entrance exam.
*07:43.280- 07:45.400* :  Sophie Williams has been finding out more.
*07:45.940- 07:51.920* :  So some crazy news, I just found it recently that a blog poster wrote 10 years ago has gone viral
*07:51.920- 07:56.560* :  after being featured in the world's toughest college entrance exam called Galkal.
*07:56.880- 08:00.200* :  That's Cash Battercharia, who runs his own travel website.
*08:00.980- 08:05.780* :  A few weeks ago, he logged onto his laptop to find a couple of peculiar emails.
*08:06.380- 08:13.280* :  Both the emails were strange because they both mentioned that we loved your story,
*08:13.280- 08:16.900* :  and it was a very good question for our exam.
*08:17.300- 08:22.420* :  The next few days, I was just looking at my website traffic.
*08:22.780- 08:26.320* :  In the morning, I suddenly started seeing this huge peak of visitors
*08:26.880- 08:30.660* :  and a seconding more messages from students in China.
*08:31.100- 08:34.960* :  I asked one of the students and she said,
*08:35.700- 08:38.960* :  oh, don't you know, you've been featured in Galkal.
*08:43.080- 08:45.480* :  The Galkal is a big event in China.
*08:46.060- 08:48.500* :  Parents line the streets to wish their children well,
*08:48.920- 08:50.840* :  as they head to school to take the exam.
*08:51.780- 08:55.200* :  This year, just under 13 million students took the Galkal
*08:55.640- 08:57.700* :  in order to gain access to university.
*08:58.260- 09:03.480* :  Cash's blog post used in the exam told the story of how he decided to get a taxi
*09:03.480- 09:07.780* :  to the bus station in Vienna when he thought he might miss his coach to Prague.
*09:08.460- 09:12.340* :  Gunter was his taxi driver and got him there in a speedy time.
*09:13.120- 09:15.940* :  But then Cash realized he didn't have any money on him.
*09:16.360- 09:20.000* :  And I could see in the distance the bus to Prague was about to leave.
*09:20.340- 09:21.540* :  Everybody was about to get in the coach.
*09:22.560- 09:24.200* :  And then I turned to what's going to in the rain.
*09:24.200- 09:26.400* :  It was like a scene out of a Hollywood love story.
*09:26.980- 09:29.920* :  I'm looking at him and I'm saying Gunter, we've only just met,
*09:30.640- 09:32.240* :  but I have a big thing to ask you.
*09:32.720- 09:34.940* :  I'm going to come back to Vienna in four days.
*09:35.060- 09:37.220* :  Is it okay for me to give you the cash then?
*09:38.000- 09:40.100* :  And that was the task for the students.
*09:40.980- 09:44.500* :  They had to complete the story based on what they thought happened next.
*09:45.020- 09:49.880* :  And then they picked up their phones and posted written comments to let Cash know.
*09:50.260- 09:53.160* :  Your story is in the Chinese college entrance examination.
*09:53.960- 09:56.120* :  You are a famous storyteller in China.
*09:56.580- 09:58.100* :  Your experience is so touching.
*09:58.480- 09:59.740* :  I wish the best for you.
*10:00.380- 10:04.200* :  I never expected one day I would read a story about a person
*10:04.460- 10:08.020* :  thousands of kilometers away from me on my exam paper.
*10:08.740- 10:13.060* :  However, what saddens me is that I didn't write well about your story.
*10:13.660- 10:15.500* :  But what actually did happen?
*10:15.960- 10:20.820* :  Two days later, right back in Vienna and told him to give me a lift to my hostel.
*10:21.820- 10:25.500* :  And giving the money and we had a cheeky beer and it took a little selfie.
*10:26.140- 10:27.820* :  And does Gunter know his famous?
*10:28.420- 10:30.580* :  Unfortunately, I exchanged phone numbers with Gunter,
*10:30.580- 10:33.640* :  but that phone got stolen a few months later.
*10:33.880- 10:36.720* :  Coincidentally, I'm going back to Vienna in August.
*10:37.220- 10:40.040* :  And I've tried reaching out through a few forums
*10:40.220- 10:42.280* :  and I have not had any success so far.
*10:42.280- 10:45.680* :  So if anybody's in Vienna listening to this
*10:45.740- 10:48.220* :  or knows that a taxi driver called Gunter,
*10:48.900- 10:49.940* :  please drop me a line.
*10:49.940- 10:51.100* :  I'd love to meet him.
*10:51.720- 10:54.980* :  I was cash bachacharya ending that report from Sophie Williams.
*10:54.980- 10:59.360* :  Well, if you've ever been helped out by a kind stranger like cash
*10:59.360- 11:03.520* :  or even found yourself the subject of a school exam, do get in touch.
*11:05.080- 11:07.320* :  A skateboarding has something of a reputation,
*11:07.340- 11:11.680* :  the world over as a young person's sport and saw some of the youngest
*11:11.680- 11:14.960* :  medalists when it debuted at the Tokyo Olympics.
*11:15.820- 11:20.480* :  But at the Paris Games, it will see one of the oldest athletes from any event.
*11:21.000- 11:25.240* :  Andy McDonald, who's 50 and originally from Massachusetts in the US,
*11:25.740- 11:29.400* :  says his selection to represent Team GB in the park event
*11:29.400- 11:31.820* :  shows age really is just a number.
*11:32.000- 11:36.120* :  He holds the record for the most skateboarding medals at the X Games,
*11:36.120- 11:38.980* :  the pinnacle championships of extreme sports.
*11:38.980- 11:42.840* :  He's been named World Champion Skateboard at nine times,
*11:42.840- 11:46.100* :  and he invented tricks that will feature at the Olympics.
*11:46.680- 11:49.220* :  So how does it feel to be competing in Paris?
*11:49.740- 11:51.300* :  He's been speaking to Nichev Lada.
*11:52.000- 11:54.080* :  Pretty surreal. I don't think that a lot of people
*11:54.960- 11:57.960* :  really grasp the how lucky I am.
*11:58.220- 12:02.560* :  Just like, what a long shot it was from the beginning.
*12:03.180- 12:07.580* :  I had a conversation with my wife like, hey, you know, my dad's British,
*12:07.580- 12:10.460* :  so I could get a British passport and I could go out for the British national team
*12:10.980- 12:12.360* :  like two and a half years ago.
*12:12.700- 12:17.280* :  And if I happen to make the team, then they'll fund my
*12:18.200- 12:20.120* :  journey toward the Olympics going to all the
*12:20.880- 12:23.280* :  qualification competitions all around the world,
*12:23.760- 12:27.900* :  you know, which would be super cool and a new experience and a learning experience for me,
*12:27.900- 12:32.020* :  because Olympic Park skateboarding is a discipline that I'm not known for.
*12:32.020- 12:34.980* :  I'm known for half-pipes skating and it's on bigger ramps.
*12:35.040- 12:38.620* :  And it was like learning a new discipline for the Olympics.
*12:39.040- 12:41.780* :  You know, when you look at the stats for the Great Britain team,
*12:41.780- 12:47.120* :  and they have sky-brown and Lada-tambling, you know, teenage ages.
*12:47.120- 12:53.620* :  And then you see, Andy McDonald, 50, does it feel strange to be amongst two
*12:53.620- 12:57.700* :  teenagers who are essentially the same ages as your child, your children?
*12:58.320- 13:00.960* :  It doesn't feel strange because that's what I've been doing.
*13:00.960- 13:03.020* :  You know, I never stop skateboarding.
*13:03.020- 13:06.920* :  So generally when I'm out on the Olympic tour, my peers,
*13:06.920- 13:11.000* :  the guys that I came up and competed with for years on the
*13:11.000- 13:12.880* :  Pro Tour are generally the coaches.
*13:13.460- 13:14.820* :  And I wasn't ready for that yet.
*13:14.820- 13:17.640* :  I just was like, maybe I can still compete with the kids.
*13:18.120- 13:22.480* :  Really, that's, I think, been beneficial to the British team
*13:22.980- 13:29.040* :  in me being able to share some of that experience and knowledge of having done this for 35 years.
*13:29.560- 13:32.020* :  You know, certainly as far as like nerding out as far as like,
*13:32.020- 13:33.300* :  oh, you know, who invented that trick?
*13:33.340- 13:33.860* :  I did.
*13:36.080- 13:39.580* :  And then there's as much resource and motivation for me,
*13:39.580- 13:45.160* :  because I go down and it takes me a lot longer to heal and get back up than they do.
*13:45.280- 13:46.460* :  And they're just like, go on, let's go.
*13:46.480- 13:47.960* :  And like, it's motivating to me.
*13:47.960- 13:53.560* :  I'll see one of my teammates go down and just pop back up and like get right.
*13:53.560- 13:57.280* :  And I was like, if I fell that hard, I would be out for two weeks.
*13:57.280- 13:59.340* :  You know, but they're just up there like, let's go.
*13:59.940- 14:02.000* :  And it just makes me want to do it as well.
*14:02.400- 14:07.100* :  What stands out for you in the lead up to these games in what you've achieved already?
*14:07.100- 14:09.420* :  Because there is so much.
*14:09.820- 14:11.580* :  Yeah, it's been it's been a journey.
*14:11.580- 14:16.920* :  I think that in a way, it's fitting because when I started out as a professional skateboarder,
*14:17.400- 14:20.640* :  I used to get made fun of because I took skateboarding serious.
*14:20.640- 14:22.240* :  Like it was it was a sport to me.
*14:22.600- 14:25.100* :  And I don't party and I don't drink and I don't have tattoos.
*14:25.100- 14:30.240* :  And I was like this clean cut image that did not fit in the world of course skateboarding.
*14:30.580- 14:32.920* :  And especially in the 80s 90s skateboard culture,
*14:32.920- 14:38.240* :  it was about that anti hero anti establishment image that was marketable.
*14:38.580- 14:39.580* :  And I did not fit that.
*14:39.580- 14:44.060* :  I was the as sports illustrated, put it the mother approved skateboarder.
*14:44.260- 14:47.200* :  To me, skateboarding taught me that anybody can skateboard.
*14:47.200- 14:54.080* :  Anybody can from all walks of life, any socio economic backgrounds can be a part of skateboarding.
*14:54.080- 14:54.900* :  And those no bounds.
*14:54.900- 14:56.780* :  And I hate the gym.
*14:57.640- 15:02.540* :  But I'll skate for five, eight hours a day if I can, you know, just skateboarding was it for me.
*15:02.540- 15:13.280* :  And here I am as far as that transition from skateboarding as this kind of outlaw anti-establishment
*15:13.280- 15:17.400* :  activity to the sport of skateboarding in the Olympics.
*15:18.060- 15:22.800* :  I've always supported it and somehow managed to do it this late in my career.
*15:23.640- 15:28.500* :  And you can hear the full interview and those with other Olympians on sports are wherever you get
*15:28.500- 15:29.460* :  your BBC podcasts.
*15:34.860- 15:39.840* :  Coming up in this podcast, we'll hear what's on the menu for the athletes in the Olympic village.
*15:40.140- 15:41.680* :  I'm a classmate, it's quite the symbol of Paris.
*15:42.140- 15:47.620* :  In this one, you have a bit of an artichoke puree, a post-tec, a bit of truffle, and a bit of cheese.
*15:57.680- 15:58.400* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*15:58.400- 16:02.360* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*16:02.660- 16:05.020* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*16:05.360- 16:08.960* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*16:08.960- 16:12.760* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*16:13.040- 16:18.040* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*16:18.480- 16:20.820* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.
*16:20.820- 16:24.440* :  $45 upfront for three months plus taxes and fees, promoting for new customers for limited time.
*16:24.440- 16:27.240* :  Unlimited more than 40 gigabytes per month slows, full turns at MintMobile.com.
*16:27.940- 16:31.200* :  This season, Instacart has your back to school.
*16:31.880- 16:36.600* :  As in, they've got your back to school lunch favorites like snack packs and fresh fruit.
*16:37.040- 16:41.380* :  And they've got your back to school supplies like backpacks, binders, and pencils.
*16:42.300- 16:48.440* :  And they've got your back when your kid casually tells you they have a huge school project to do
*16:48.600- 16:52.080* :  tomorrow. Let's face it, we were all that kid.
*16:52.760- 16:58.900* :  So first, call your parents to say I'm sorry and then download the Instacart app to get
*16:58.900- 17:04.800* :  delivery in as fast as 30 minutes all school year long. Get a $0 delivery fee with your
*17:04.800- 17:09.920* :  first three orders while supplies last. Minimum $10 in order, additional terms apply.
*17:14.420- 17:19.060* :  Around the world, zoos can play a vital role in protecting the future of threatened
*17:19.060- 17:24.220* :  or endangered animals. As we heard last week, rhinos bred in captivity are even being used
*17:24.220- 17:30.940* :  to help their wild cousins get pregnant with IVF. But what about zoo animals that don't feel in
*17:30.940- 17:38.760* :  the mood to make babies? Well, since 1943, only 23 platypus babies, or puggles, have been born
*17:38.760- 17:45.100* :  in captivity. Now, though, researchers based at Platypus Rescue HQ, part of Toronto, Western
*17:45.100- 17:50.300* :  plain zoo in Dubbo, Australia, are hoping to unlock the secrets of getting these duck-built
*17:50.300- 17:56.640* :  creatures to breed. Rebecca Wood spoke to Taronga's Wildlife Conservation Officer, Dr Phoebe Mar,
*17:56.640- 18:02.160* :  and started with the important question, what's the plural of platypus? It's actually platypusurs.
*18:02.260- 18:10.000* :  So you can use platypus as a plural, but some scientists that we work with often use platypusurs,
*18:10.080- 18:17.840* :  but it's definitely not platypus. Platypusurs are very strange creatures. If you haven't seen one,
*18:17.960- 18:25.260* :  they have the bill of a duck, and they have the body of a small beaver-style mammal, but they're
*18:25.260- 18:31.060* :  actually a monotream. So in Australia, we have two monotreams, the akidna and the platypus,
*18:31.060- 18:36.900* :  so they're egg-laying mammals, which makes them weird in itself, but they also have a range of
*18:36.900- 18:44.920* :  quirky features such as electro-receptors in their bill. They also glow green under UV light.
*18:45.100- 18:51.240* :  They have sort of a multi-tool core or front claws where they can
*18:51.560- 18:57.060* :  deter them into claws for digging, or they can flip them up and have them as paddles for swimming.
*18:57.060- 19:03.520* :  So like an aquatic wool marine. So they're absolutely incredible animals, and we just
*19:03.520- 19:09.520* :  don't know enough about them. And you mentioned there that they lay eggs, and that's quite unusual
*19:09.520- 19:15.980* :  for mammals. Does that pose a challenge in the breeding process in zoos and the world?
*19:16.340- 19:21.980* :  Oh, it's absolutely easy challenge. So in fact, it's the eggs that we're finding, it's the point
*19:21.980- 19:27.600* :  that the reproduction often fails. So platypusurs are quite good at getting together. Often the
*19:27.600- 19:33.740* :  females are quite good at producing the egg, making her a borough system, but we find that what
*19:33.740- 19:38.800* :  we're doing, particularly in a zoo setting, is not getting those borough conditions right, because
*19:38.800- 19:44.160* :  it seems the egg often fails at that stage. We mentioned there the eggs. Is there anything else
*19:44.440- 19:48.300* :  I know you're trying to find out, but anything else that it's known about why they don't breed so
*19:48.300- 19:54.740* :  well in captivity? No, we don't know. If you speak with a lot of the keepers, they say it seems quite
*19:54.740- 20:01.980* :  individual. So if they find a pair that's work well together, they will produce the offspring
*20:01.980- 20:06.500* :  every year, but it's hard to find a compatible pair. So there's definitely something about
*20:06.500- 20:12.040* :  the made choice there as well that we don't quite understand. I imagine a nice male and romantic
*20:12.040- 20:16.960* :  lighting maybe wouldn't help out. What is it that you guys are going to be doing? Yeah, no, we're not
*20:16.960- 20:23.040* :  rolling out the panda, you know, mood music that they do overseas. We're building this facility
*20:23.040- 20:30.200* :  that allows choice. We are giving them a huge space for different streams or with waterfalls,
*20:30.200- 20:36.500* :  two separate earth banks, artificial rest blocks and closures, as well as multiple tunnel systems.
*20:36.500- 20:42.640* :  It's a world-first conservation facility for particles, giving them these choice of areas to
*20:43.260- 20:48.720* :  make their boroughs, but also swim means that they can tell us what they prefer, and then we can see
*20:49.480- 20:55.160* :  what conditions result in reproductive success. Why is it so important to solve this mystery?
*20:55.580- 21:00.320* :  Well, unfortunately for the poor platypus, their population in the wild is in decline.
*21:00.560- 21:06.360* :  We also have very few platypuses in zoo settings around Australia, and there's such an
*21:06.360- 21:13.460* :  iconic species. They really are the flagship for river health in Australia. They also are emblem
*21:13.460- 21:18.980* :  species here at Chirona, so it's really important for us to get this right. I didn't know until
*21:18.980- 21:26.940* :  today that a baby platypus is called a puggle. Is that right? It's a very interesting story,
*21:26.940- 21:33.680* :  so Chirona, we have been put on a baby platypus puggles forever, and a baby a kidney is definitely
*21:33.680- 21:40.180* :  a puggle, and it seems we have adopted baby platypus as a puggle, but in fact there is no a breed of
*21:40.180- 21:47.700* :  born baby name for platypus yet. So a couple of the options are out there include a fatty pup
*21:48.400- 21:54.700* :  and a nestling, a very boring juvenile platypus, and my favourite which is indeed the puggle.
*21:54.920- 22:00.800* :  And so we have spoken to lots of people, and we would love to have puggle as the official name
*22:00.800- 22:08.600* :  for a baby platypus. So to Phoebe Mar talking to Rebecca Wood. As we love an animal story here on
*22:08.600- 22:13.240* :  the happy board, we couldn't resist telling you about a seagull who's been banned from a shop
*22:13.240- 22:19.240* :  for stealing. CCTV footage from the store endorse it in southwest England shows the bird,
*22:19.240- 22:25.860* :  nicknamed Stephen Seagull, get it? Strolling through the door, having a quick look around and then
*22:25.860- 22:29.880* :  grabbing a packet of crisps or potato chips from a bottom shelf.
*22:41.300- 22:47.560* :  There he goes, Stephen who said to have been on a six-year stealing spree, then dashes outside
*22:47.560- 22:54.220* :  and hurries off to a safe distance before tucking into his treats. The shop manager Stuart Harmer says
*22:54.220- 22:59.040* :  the bird will eat whatever crisps he can get his beacon. He'll just go for the nearest crisps
*22:59.040- 23:03.720* :  that you can, pack it open and eat it out in front of the shop. Normally it's a beef flavour that we
*23:03.720- 23:08.460* :  have from a certain supplier, but we've tried putting different crisps there that are spicier to
*23:08.460- 23:14.020* :  try and ward him off. He doesn't care. I've got to explain it to my peers why I've got stock
*23:14.020- 23:17.840* :  missing and when I tell them it's because of the seagull stealing it, they think I'm joking.
*23:18.160- 23:23.340* :  I mean he's had about 30 to 40 packets of crisps over the last couple of weeks. It's very strange.
*23:25.080- 23:28.920* :  If you've got any tales of bizarre animal behaviour, you think we'll make everyone smile.
*23:28.920- 23:34.660* :  Send us an email or a voice note, globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*23:36.260- 23:41.400* :  If you're blind or partially sighted, doing your hair can be a huge challenge.
*23:41.500- 23:46.800* :  But now one of Britain's top hair stylists is running workshops to help visually impaired women
*23:47.300- 23:53.020* :  feel more confident about their appearance. Emma Tracy from the BBC Access or podcast
*23:53.820- 24:00.420* :  went to a course in London run by Anna Kofone, who's worked with pop stars Jua Lipa and Lana Del Rey.
*24:05.260- 24:08.560* :  If you're blind or visually impaired, doing your hair can be a real pain.
*24:08.980- 24:13.480* :  I'm brushing my hair right now, but it's hard to be sure that you're looking good just through
*24:13.480- 24:18.440* :  touch. It's really important to me to feel confident about how I look when I go out.
*24:19.400- 24:24.160* :  And there's not always someone there to tell me that my hair looks right or that all the
*24:24.160- 24:29.740* :  frizzy bits have been tamed. So I'm going along to a specialist workshop to pick up some tips
*24:29.740- 24:35.920* :  which I hope will help me. Welcome, welcome, welcome everyone. This is the hair and care workshop
*24:35.920- 24:40.320* :  which helps blind and visually impaired women look after their hair. I find that since
*24:40.320- 24:44.400* :  I've become visually impaired, I do not pay as much attention to my hair as I should.
*24:45.040- 24:47.600* :  I also find it very difficult to find the right kind of products.
*24:47.940- 24:51.940* :  The participants tell me they learn all sorts of tricks and techniques.
*24:52.020- 24:55.760* :  I just never seen people brush their hair, so I assume you just always brush down,
*24:55.760- 24:59.880* :  but so much of it is to do with where you position the brush like from touch.
*24:59.880- 25:05.920* :  It could be as simple as learning how often you should wash your hair and the after your hair,
*25:06.040- 25:09.020* :  so it's really helped me in all areas really.
*25:09.140- 25:12.940* :  Coming to this workshop I've got so many more options that I didn't know I had before.
*25:13.460- 25:17.480* :  Helping me with my hair is the woman behind the workshop Anna Cafone.
*25:17.680- 25:23.080* :  If you can get both of your hands twisting the hair at the same time, yeah.
*25:23.640- 25:26.240* :  She styled hair for stars like Duolipa
*25:30.240- 25:31.220* :  and Lana Del Rey.
*25:35.820- 25:40.040* :  Anna tells me she was inspired to do this by her father who was blind.
*25:40.480- 25:46.580* :  He taught me from a very very young age just how important self-care was to him,
*25:46.580- 25:53.180* :  how it made him feel confident and how it also enabled him to feel empowered.
*25:53.880- 25:58.200* :  She's also trying to get the beauty industry to make products that are more accessible.
*25:58.680- 26:04.400* :  We've seen brands who have had raised textures on their bottles so that a person can
*26:04.400- 26:10.840* :  differentiate from a shampoo bottle to a conditioner, but there's still a really long way to go.
*26:11.260- 26:16.280* :  After one session at the hair and care workshop, I'm feeling a lot better about my hair.
*26:16.520- 26:21.900* :  It feels lovely, it feels really bouncy and the best thing is I think I could do it myself.
*26:21.940- 26:25.360* :  I know it suits me and I feel more confident about it.
*26:25.580- 26:25.840* :  Hooray!
*26:26.800- 26:30.420* :  And you can hear more on Access All, wherever you get your podcasts.
*26:31.200- 26:34.580* :  Back now to the Olympics and with France boasting a reputation,
*26:34.580- 26:38.780* :  the world over for its gourmet food, we've been wondering what's on the menu.
*26:39.360- 26:41.900* :  The crowds of athletes, hungry from training and competitions,
*26:41.900- 26:45.140* :  have been eating at the world's largest restaurant.
*26:45.140- 26:47.460* :  Isabella Joule has been finding out more.
*26:47.840- 26:51.600* :  Forget feeding the 500, how about the 15,000?
*26:52.400- 26:57.560* :  Catering in Paris this summer can only be described as a challenge of Olympic proportions.
*26:58.460- 27:01.420* :  Each day, the athletes in the Olympic and Paralympic village
*27:01.780- 27:05.200* :  are expected to munch through up to 40,000 meals.
*27:06.160- 27:10.400* :  Making the game's greener was a key element of the Paris 2024 bid,
*27:10.940- 27:13.660* :  and it's also at the centre of the food strategy.
*27:14.360- 27:19.480* :  A third of the athletes meals and two-thirds of those on offer to the public will be vegetarian,
*27:20.220- 27:22.720* :  and organic and local produce feature heavily.
*27:23.060- 27:25.600* :  Philip Words is the food and beverage manager.
*27:25.840- 27:29.580* :  It is a rich variety that will be plant-based,
*27:30.040- 27:33.180* :  that will be made available for the general public to try,
*27:33.520- 27:36.460* :  and hopefully fingers crossed are actually quite convinced about this.
*27:36.780- 27:41.100* :  They will love it, and they will ask future event organizers
*27:41.580- 27:45.680* :  to propose more vegetarian food over than what has been proposed in the past.
*27:46.440- 27:50.020* :  Also on the menu are some French classics with a twist.
*27:50.020- 27:54.520* :  The caterers wrote in renowned chefs to create some rather special dishes.
*27:55.240- 27:57.120* :  Amondine Chignol is one of them.
*27:57.300- 28:02.680* :  I wanted the recipe that I suggested to be quite representative about the French terroir,
*28:03.200- 28:05.760* :  and in the meantime, I wanted the athletes to enjoy it.
*28:05.940- 28:11.080* :  So I wanted to do recipes which are both very rich, very good-mod,
*28:11.080- 28:15.280* :  very mouth-wrenching in the meantime, quite easy to understand.
*28:15.280- 28:18.020* :  So I think the plasma is quite the symbol of Paris.
*28:18.500- 28:20.580* :  In this one, you have a bit of artichoke puree,
*28:20.720- 28:24.020* :  a poached egg, a bit of truffle, and a bit of cheese.
*28:24.220- 28:28.800* :  So it's both vegetarian and still very mouth-wrenching.
*28:29.460- 28:34.820* :  As well as pimped-up pastries, the menu features freshly baked bread and gallic cheeses.
*28:35.480- 28:38.920* :  The athletes are expected to eat 2,000 baguettes a day,
*28:39.360- 28:41.680* :  the most quintessential of French carbs.
*28:42.760- 28:44.900* :  And they won't just be eating the baguettes.
*28:45.240- 28:47.760* :  Tony Doray is a baker in the Olympic restaurant.
*28:47.760- 28:53.500* :  From 11 to 1130, we'll be doing some activities
*28:53.500- 28:57.140* :  and allowing the athletes to make their own baguettes by hand, with me,
*28:57.140- 29:00.540* :  so I can pass on all my expertise as a baker to them,
*29:01.180- 29:03.500* :  so that they can make their own baguettes, bake them,
*29:03.780- 29:08.300* :  and take them home to enjoy, and have the pride of having made a good French baguette.
*29:08.700- 29:12.860* :  The caterers are trying to offer a diverse range of flavors to suit all tastes.
*29:13.520- 29:15.780* :  They've picked 4 cuisines to plan the meals around.
*29:15.820- 29:20.660* :  French, Asian, African and Caribbean, and international food.
*29:21.460- 29:25.380* :  For many athletes, the Olympic canteen has been a place of culinary discovery.
