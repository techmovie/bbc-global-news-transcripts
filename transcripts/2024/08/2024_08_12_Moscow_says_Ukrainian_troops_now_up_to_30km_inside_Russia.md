*01:29.320- 01:32.520* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:35.280- 01:39.880* :  I'm Janet Jalil and in the early hours of Monday the 12th of August these are our main stories.
*01:40.680- 01:45.560* :  Colons of Ukrainian armoured vehicles have been seen moving towards the Russian border as
*01:45.560- 01:51.320* :  Kiev presses on with its offensive in the Kursk region. President Biden has said he did not
*01:51.320- 01:56.560* :  seek re-election because he wanted to avoid becoming a distraction in the Democrats campaign
*01:56.560- 02:02.440* :  to defeat Donald Trump. The new interim government in Bangladesh says it's determined to prevent
*02:02.440- 02:05.540* :  further attacks on Hindus and other minorities.
*02:08.740- 02:14.700* :  Also in this podcast. While a group of more than 50 Argentinian athletes were taking a group photo,
*02:14.700- 02:21.660* :  Pablo Simonet got on his knee and proposed to his longtime girlfriend Maria Pilar Campoy.
*02:22.280- 02:27.180* :  We look at some of the romantic moments from the Olympics in Paris as the games end.
*02:31.680- 02:36.720* :  Russia has acknowledged that Ukrainian forces have penetrated deep into its territory
*02:37.340- 02:41.480* :  as far as 30 kilometres in despite its attempts to push them out.
*02:42.080- 02:46.360* :  Six days into the surprise incursion into southwestern Russia by Ukrainian forces,
*02:46.840- 02:51.680* :  there are reports of a large increase in military activity on both sides of the border.
*02:52.340- 02:58.000* :  Residents of Sumi in northern Ukraine are reporting a flow of personnel carriers, tanks and
*02:58.000- 03:03.380* :  supply lorries on their way to the Russian region of Kursk. As Kiev presses on with its offensive,
*03:03.940- 03:10.140* :  saying it has thousands of troops on Russian soil. Moscow has vowed a tough response as it
*03:10.140- 03:15.080* :  carries out retaliatory strikes. In a Sufson, a member of the Ukrainian parliament,
*03:15.080- 03:21.740* :  said the offensive was widely supported by Ukrainians. People are scared because the war was not
*03:21.740- 03:26.880* :  going the way we expected it to go for the last year. And now we are seeing that actually
*03:26.880- 03:30.500* :  the Ukrainian army can fight back and there are vulnerabilities among the Russians,
*03:30.540- 03:36.860* :  so it does boost them around inside the country as well. And we hope it shows to the world that we
*03:36.860- 03:42.280* :  can fight back and the world should be supporting us. Our correspondent James Waterhouse sent
*03:42.280- 03:47.000* :  this report from the Sumi region of northern Ukraine from where the incursion was launched.
*03:47.460- 03:51.480* :  Russia briefly occupied parts of the Sumi region in the early weeks of the invasion,
*03:51.960- 03:55.480* :  but until recently the area has experienced a reprieve from the fighting.
*03:56.140- 03:59.260* :  Russian forces have gathered on the border and increased air strikes.
*03:59.780- 04:04.300* :  The school where the above works was recently hit with a glide bomb. We met her helping with the
*04:04.300- 04:09.440* :  clear-up next to the giant crater it caused. She's pleased Ukrainian forces have launched a
*04:09.440- 04:16.540* :  cross-border offensive into Russia's Kurds region. I think it's the right thing. They should
*04:16.540- 04:23.580* :  be punished. We'll rebuild the school, but we'll never forgive them. Never. Why did they come to our
*04:23.580- 04:29.600* :  land? The flow of personnel carriers, tanks and supply trucks suggests Ukraine is committed to this
*04:29.600- 04:35.060* :  battlefield gamble. All of them have been branded with a triangle symbol, suggesting they are involved
*04:35.060- 04:40.100* :  in the same operation. They are fighting on a new front line, reportedly 20 miles long,
*04:40.100- 04:44.180* :  and crucially for Ukraine, Russian forces are being drawn from elsewhere.
*04:45.180- 04:50.000* :  James Waterhouse in northern Ukraine, well I asked our security correspondent Gordon Carrera
*04:50.000- 04:55.020* :  for more on Ukraine's strategy in deciding to take the war onto Russian territory.
*04:55.720- 05:01.560* :  It is a bold and perhaps risky gamble by Ukraine. It's certainly taken Russia by surprise,
*05:01.560- 05:08.040* :  pushing what seemed to be thousands of well-trained troops into Russia, provocative. I mean,
*05:08.040- 05:13.080* :  that's the language Vladimir Putin used, but what is the strategy? The suggestion is part of it,
*05:13.080- 05:20.860* :  I think, is to try and stretch Russian forces. Russia has been making advances inside Ukraine recently
*05:20.880- 05:25.140* :  in the Donbass area, and I think the hope will be that some of those troops will then have to
*05:25.140- 05:30.400* :  be redeployed to defend Russian soil, so the hope will be it will take some of the pressure
*05:31.140- 05:37.200* :  off other areas where Ukraine is operating. Also, I think a psychological blow on Russia,
*05:37.620- 05:43.300* :  not entirely clear whether Ukraine intends to hold that territory, because you can imagine
*05:43.300- 05:47.220* :  Russia is going to come back with enormous force to try and take it back. I think there is a
*05:47.220- 05:50.980* :  question there about whether Ukraine will stay in fight or whether it will make if you like a
*05:50.980- 05:55.580* :  tactical withdrawal at one point. We don't really know that. Yes, it's hard to see how a
*05:55.580- 06:01.420* :  President Putin could tolerate this. This must be very humiliating for him, but it also shows how
*06:01.860- 06:07.540* :  effective President Zelensky is getting the world's attention as well as boosting morale back home,
*06:07.540- 06:13.120* :  because the successes that Ukraine has had in the Black Sea and Crimea are not really getting the
*06:13.120- 06:17.280* :  same headlines they used to. That's right. I mean, I was in Ukraine maybe about a month ago,
*06:17.480- 06:22.020* :  and I think the mood was certainly a bit bleaker, a bit darker amongst the public and policy
*06:22.020- 06:26.280* :  makers. There was a recognition things had not gone that well on the battlefield, and then suddenly
*06:26.280- 06:30.140* :  with this one move you can change the dynamic. You can make the Russian people question the
*06:30.140- 06:34.660* :  costs of the war. You can make the Ukrainian people feel they've had a victory and you can send a
*06:34.660- 06:39.640* :  message to allies to suggest it's not as simple as Ukraine is going to be on the backfoot permanently
*06:39.660- 06:44.420* :  and may have to enter into negotiations on the backfoot and concede territory, but it might be
*06:44.420- 06:49.520* :  able to build up bargaining chips or put pressure on Russia as well. So I think there are lots of
*06:49.520- 06:53.520* :  ways in which even if it doesn't last that long or even if it doesn't necessarily end that well,
*06:53.720- 06:58.660* :  can still have some advantages for Ukraine. At the same time, this is quite uncomfortable for NATO,
*06:58.660- 07:04.020* :  because it's equipment. It seems as now being used in Russia and that would be another threshold
*07:04.020- 07:09.960* :  cross. It looks like some equipment is being used. We don't know about the high-end weapon systems,
*07:09.960- 07:15.880* :  and that's where the most controversy has been, some of the rocket and missiles that have been
*07:15.880- 07:21.540* :  supplied by the West, which have been supplied with restrictions on their use in Russia. For instance,
*07:21.540- 07:25.600* :  the US originally said they could not be used at all in Russia, and then they, for instance,
*07:25.600- 07:30.480* :  when there was an offensive by Russia against the Ukrainian city of Harkiv, they said that they could
*07:30.500- 07:35.160* :  be used just over the border from Harkiv to stop that offensive. So you've seen some shifts
*07:35.160- 07:40.080* :  in positions, but we don't really know here what discussions they've been and what weapons are
*07:40.080- 07:44.840* :  being used exactly. And I think that is an important question, because I think there is the suggestion
*07:45.420- 07:49.560* :  that Western officials might not have known that much about this operation by Ukraine either.
*07:49.920- 07:55.300* :  So you'd imagine there'll be discussions going on now about what's happening and using what systems.
*07:56.180- 08:01.440* :  Our security correspondent Gordon Carrera, in his first interview since pulling out of the US
*08:01.440- 08:07.000* :  presidential race, Joe Biden has stressed that Donald Trump must be defeated for the United States
*08:07.000- 08:13.140* :  to maintain its democracy. Mr. Biden said he'd stepped aside because he was becoming a distraction
*08:13.140- 08:18.680* :  to achieving this. He endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to take over from him after a
*08:18.680- 08:24.060* :  faltering performance in his first and only debate with Mr. Trump and intense pressure from his
*08:24.060- 08:30.440* :  own party. In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump would be a real danger
*08:30.760- 08:37.220* :  if we elected. I'm giving my word, I think, to that I mark my words. If he wins this election,
*08:37.340- 08:45.640* :  watch what happens. It's a danger to American security. Look, we're at an inflection point in
*08:45.640- 08:51.880* :  world history. We really are. The decisions we make in the last three, four years, the next three
*08:51.880- 08:56.900* :  four is going to determine what the next six decades look like. Julian Marshall spoke to
*08:56.900- 09:03.280* :  Camel McCarthy of Politico Magazine. Mr. Biden is still continuing to insist he was simply
*09:03.280- 09:09.480* :  having a bad day in that infamous TV debate with Donald Trump. He had his first sit down interview
*09:09.480- 09:16.400* :  today and we saw a little bit of a shift. He did reiterate that he believed that it was a very bad
*09:16.400- 09:21.540* :  debate performance. That's something that he has said over time, but he also kind of talked a
*09:21.540- 09:26.840* :  little bit about how he was a transition president, which is something new that we haven't seen.
*09:26.840- 09:32.760* :  He kind of pointed to that back in 2020, not directly saying those words, but saying that he was
*09:32.840- 09:38.320* :  here to kind of bring in the new generation for Democrats. That was what he kind of said today
*09:38.320- 09:44.740* :  and leaning away from this was just a bad night to I am this transitionary period for the presidency.
*09:45.000- 09:50.320* :  He also vowed to help Kamala Harris to win, but, but how? One of the
*09:50.320- 09:55.900* :  newsier parts of the interview was he announced he's actually doing a campaign tour in Pennsylvania.
*09:55.980- 10:03.360* :  Pennsylvania is one of the battleground states that Joe Biden won in 2020 and he's originally from
*10:03.360- 10:07.740* :  there. He's from Scranton, Pennsylvania. And so during this interview, he announced he would be
*10:07.740- 10:13.560* :  doing a campaign tour to help Kamala Harris, specifically alongside Pennsylvania governor
*10:13.560- 10:17.560* :  Josh Shapiro, who was one of the potential running mates for Kamala Harris.
*10:17.980- 10:22.780* :  And just a democratic party, hierarchy, think that's a good or bad idea.
*10:22.980- 10:27.500* :  The campaign trail, this is a place and a demographic that Joe Biden knows well.
*10:27.500- 10:32.520* :  And so having him there, you know, could hurt in some states, but in other states like
*10:32.520- 10:36.600* :  Pennsylvania, it absolutely would help. So, you know, even though he is stepping aside from
*10:36.920- 10:40.800* :  the presidency, he's still a big name and he still is the current president right now.
*10:41.340- 10:44.880* :  How's Kamala Harris currently doing in the opinion polls?
*10:45.280- 10:50.660* :  So we've definitely seen a little bit of a boost at least compared to when Biden was in the running
*10:50.660- 10:56.720* :  post that debate that we talked about, but at the same time, it's still going to be a very close
*10:56.720- 11:01.600* :  race. You know, we're seeing Kamala come a little bit ahead in a lot of these states that matter,
*11:01.980- 11:06.240* :  these battleground states that are ultimately going to decide the presidency. So those are the
*11:06.240- 11:10.120* :  states that we're going to have to be keeping eye on, but I mean, regardless, it's going to be a neck
*11:10.460- 11:17.740* :  election. Mir Kamil McCarthy of Politico Magazine. Bangladesh's interim government says it has
*11:17.740- 11:22.920* :  grave concerns about attacks on Hindus and other minorities since the former prime minister,
*11:22.920- 11:28.760* :  Sheikh Haseena, was ousted. The authoritarian leader fled Bangladesh last week after weeks of
*11:28.760- 11:34.180* :  protest in which hundreds of people were killed, many of them shot by the police. The new interim
*11:34.180- 11:39.240* :  government headed by Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammed Yunus now faces a challenge of how to
*11:39.240- 11:46.060* :  stop such attacks when many police officers have disappeared, fearing reprisals. Mr. Yunus said
*11:46.060- 11:52.100* :  restoring law and order was his priority. Farida actor is a member of the new interim government
*11:52.100- 11:59.980* :  in Bangladesh. First of all, the law and order situation is not very much in order. Also, I think
*11:59.980- 12:06.940* :  the past regime was so corrupt and there were so many problems. So there are a lot of things that
*12:07.500- 12:15.580* :  needs to be corrected and also because of some international moves also, particularly from
*12:15.580- 12:23.560* :  our neighboring country, they are trying to create a situation that is like communal violence
*12:24.200- 12:31.860* :  and that matters to us very much because Bangladesh is a country which has a tradition of living in
*12:31.860- 12:39.940* :  harmony with different religious communities. So when they say that the Hindu people are being
*12:40.400- 12:46.040* :  targeted and killed, of course, there have been some incidences like that which is very
*12:46.040- 12:54.180* :  unacceptable and we are very much concerned about that. But we want to make sure that the people
*12:54.180- 13:02.520* :  of all religion, of all caste, they should be safe. Farida actor, a spectacular closing
*13:02.520- 13:08.040* :  ceremony for the Paris Olympics has taken place in the Stad de France. The French swimming star,
*13:08.040- 13:13.540* :  Leon Mashaun, extinguished the Olympic Cauldron before athletes paraded into the patch stadium
*13:13.540- 13:19.780* :  waving the flags of every nation involved. The Hollywood star, Tom Cruise, ab sailed into the
*13:19.780- 13:26.360* :  stadium to accept the Olympic flag. Los Angeles will now host the next games in 2028.
*13:26.360- 13:32.700* :  The BBC's Maria Mashaury watched the closing ceremony. We've had athletes, volunteers, leaders
*13:32.700- 13:38.480* :  and fans all gathering to mark the end of the games and it is as it was so promised, a celebration
*13:38.600- 13:45.100* :  of France, the French culture and indeed of Olympic history. So we started the evening at the
*13:45.100- 13:50.520* :  Olympic flame in the Jardin de Toulierri, to the tune of Edith Piaf's classic song, Sulicelle
*13:50.800- 13:56.720* :  de Paris, under the Paris sky. We saw the French swimming legend, superstar, Leon Mashaun,
*13:56.720- 14:01.820* :  take a portion of that flame and start its journey all the way back to the Stad de France.
*14:01.820- 14:07.540* :  Once there, we welcomed in the athletes whose hard work, dedication and pursuit of victory,
*14:07.540- 14:12.560* :  has entertained all of us. For them, tonight, the work is done, it's time to party.
*14:12.560- 14:18.380* :  The stadium was then plunged into darkness and the golden voyager, it's called the figure,
*14:18.740- 14:23.840* :  clad from head to toe in gold, going through what we're told, was an exploration of history
*14:23.840- 14:29.260* :  of the Olympic Games. And then through music and dance and some pretty brilliant acrobatics,
*14:29.260- 14:35.740* :  the Olympic rings are unearthed and raised to the sky to huge applause. It really was an amazing
*14:35.740- 14:39.120* :  ceremony, organised by the same people who organised the opening ceremony.
*14:39.720- 14:44.560* :  Mary Mashauri, where the event brought to an end a fortnight of sporting excellence that saw
*14:44.560- 14:51.180* :  the United States edging out China to come top of the medals table by winning gold in the final
*14:51.180- 14:56.700* :  event women's basketball. Sports world's Lee James has been in Paris for a total.
*14:57.120- 15:00.720* :  It's all this action we've had over the last couple of weeks, Janet, and it went down to the
*15:00.720- 15:08.360* :  very final second of the very final event. Gabby Williams of France, with an opportunity
*15:08.360- 15:15.220* :  to take this final into overtime, but it was a two pointer and not three. It therefore left the
*15:15.220- 15:20.780* :  U.S. to celebrate their eighth successive gold medal in women's basketball. And it meant, as you
*15:20.780- 15:25.500* :  say, that the U.S.A finish on top of the medals table. Forty gold, the same as China, but they
*15:25.500- 15:31.680* :  have 126 medals overall compared to China's 91. Some other standout moments from the final day,
*15:31.680- 15:36.100* :  Cifan Hassan of the Netherlands, winning the women's marathon, adding the gold to her bronze medals
*15:36.100- 15:40.780* :  in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters earlier in the week. And Elise Andrews, who became the first
*15:40.780- 15:45.900* :  cyclist from New Zealand to a track sprint title at the Velodrome. She'd already won gold in the
*15:45.920- 15:50.400* :  queue and it has been another incredible games for New Zealand. As it has for the host, despite that
*15:50.400- 15:57.020* :  loss in the basketball final, they finish fifth on the medals table with 16 gold, 64 overall,
*15:57.020- 16:02.840* :  their best performance since they hosted back in 1900. And what's really enhanced these games
*16:02.980- 16:08.280* :  has been the number of iconic locations that these events have been taking place in.
*16:09.140- 16:13.480* :  That's right. If we think that to the opening ceremony in the rain, but along the river Sen,
*16:13.480- 16:18.240* :  it was very ambitious and lavish, and it really set the tone for these games from the beach
*16:18.240- 16:23.140* :  volleyball, under the eyeful tower to the elegant surroundings of the chateau de Versailles,
*16:23.380- 16:28.720* :  for the equestrian events, the grand splendor of the Grand Palais, for the fencing and the
*16:28.720- 16:34.040* :  taïquando and iconic sporting venues like Roland Garros used for tennis and boxing. It really
*16:34.040- 16:39.680* :  has been outstanding and it's produced some wonderful moments from Lear Marshall making his
*16:39.680- 16:44.640* :  mark in the pool for France winning four individual gold medals, no allials, picture perfect,
*16:44.640- 16:49.000* :  photo finishing that 100 meters to one of the greatest Olympic comebacks from some
*16:49.000- 16:55.460* :  own vials to win three golds and Teddy Linner for the French nation winning gold in the judo and
*16:55.460- 17:00.900* :  Pauline Ferram Prievo, some real standouts for me as well from this fortnight covering the games.
*17:01.520- 17:07.160* :  Lee James, so what legacy will these Olympic games leave? The French Minister for Sport is Amelie
*17:07.160- 17:13.800* :  Udiakastera. We have invested in a number of sports, in haste, culture and equipments all across
*17:14.580- 17:23.760* :  France since 2017. We've been investing more than 1.2 billion in those sport equipments.
*17:23.760- 17:32.840* :  We have also transformed the public transport system and deployed services for the disabled
*17:32.840- 17:39.840* :  people so that we improve really the level of accessibility. There is also the big legacy which
*17:39.840- 17:47.660* :  is going to be the ability to swim in the river sand starting next summer and this will change
*17:47.660- 17:56.100* :  the quality of life at a time when we have that climate warming, global warming so that's a big
*17:56.140- 18:02.500* :  element too but I think more importantly it's a real great demonstration of the power of sports
*18:03.280- 18:10.940* :  and the power and the capacity I would say of France to achieve great things to really work
*18:11.760- 18:18.500* :  in the united way with high ambitions to deliver something that the country can be proud of
*18:18.500- 18:26.260* :  and that is an invaluable legacy. Amelie Udiakastera, the French Minister for Sport and we'll have
*18:26.260- 18:34.640* :  more on the Olympics later in this podcast. Still to come. Until now, Asam's government has
*18:34.640- 18:39.340* :  recommended installing electric fences to keep elephants away from towns and villages,

*20:14.180- 20:22.020* :  Northern Nigeria. 4.4 million children there under the age of five are acutely malnourished.
*20:22.440- 20:26.980* :  That's more than double last year's figure, according to the World Food Programme.
*20:27.560- 20:33.440* :  Families are grappling with high food inflation and banditry, and many can no longer afford to
*20:33.440- 20:38.920* :  feed their children the way they used to. Medina Machanu has been to the main city of Cat
*20:38.920- 20:45.640* :  thinner state to find out more. It's a chaotic scene as a crowd of parents and children
*20:45.640- 20:50.540* :  pushed their way to the front of an open building. This malnutrition clinic in Cat's
*20:50.540- 20:56.500* :  Innocity is run by eight group doctors with our bodies or MSF. As the situation comes down,
*20:56.500- 21:03.240* :  I spot Murja clutching two small babies. It hurts me to see other kids looking chubby and healthy,
*21:03.260- 21:09.900* :  but she keeps getting smaller by the day. As well as her own baby, Murja cares for her seven-month-old
*21:09.900- 21:15.240* :  niece, Unni, and often. Now she's struggling to make enough breast milk for them both.
*21:17.240- 21:21.280* :  On days that I find food the babies can eat, but on days that I don't get to eat,
*21:21.640- 21:26.580* :  they'll keep sucking on cry because of hunger. The World Food Programme says two million
*21:26.580- 21:32.120* :  children under five were acutely malnourished in Northern Nigeria last year, and that number has
*21:32.120- 21:37.860* :  more than doubled to 4.4 million this year. I'm in a huge crowd of people right now at MSF
*21:37.860- 21:43.700* :  Ambulatory Treatment Centre at Go for Murja in Cat's Innocity, and I can hear crying babies everywhere
*21:43.700- 21:49.140* :  mothers clutching to their crying babies. It's a bit chaotic to be honest. It's hot and
*21:49.140- 21:57.060* :  dusty at the same time right now. Across town, MSF runs another inpatient clinic for severely
*21:57.060- 22:02.120* :  malnourished children. Some are offered a highly nutritional paste called Plumpy Knot.
*22:04.380- 22:07.480* :  That is the sound of a mother trying to give her child the Plumpy Knot.
*22:07.800- 22:13.680* :  To see if the child will accept it so that he can be given more of these sachets to take home.
*22:14.760- 22:21.480* :  Dr. Mohib Bakengiwa has been working with MSF for almost two years. Seeing them in that condition
*22:22.600- 22:30.980* :  do affect me mentally because you make all provisions for the patients to be better, but yet still
*22:31.700- 22:39.500* :  you have motalities and patients will give up right in front of your eyes.
*22:41.680- 22:46.460* :  In a medical tent, I come across Jamila. She brought her baby here a few days ago.
*22:46.720- 22:50.380* :  After his body kept swelling up and the general hospital couldn't help.
*22:51.840- 22:55.860* :  He became malnourished right after I went him. He used to be fine. Now we like food.
*22:57.160- 23:02.500* :  We used to live in the village, but Bandits forced us to live. We used to farm, but now we can't do that
*23:02.500- 23:07.980* :  anymore. An Algerian army spokesperson recently said they have re-strategized the national
*23:07.980- 23:13.200* :  fight against the Bandits to help farmers return to their land. And in response to this report,
*23:13.320- 23:18.960* :  Katzenar's deputy governor for Ruk Lowell-Juby disputes that malnutrition is rising in the state.
*23:19.620- 23:22.760* :  He tells us the attacking the root causes of hunger.
*23:23.520- 23:30.120* :  The short-term strategy that we have embarked upon was a procurement of asserted grains,
*23:30.120- 23:35.260* :  which we saw at highly subsidized prices. And there are some that we gave out free.
*23:35.700- 23:40.820* :  We recently conducted joint ski operations in the front line local governments.
*23:40.960- 23:45.340* :  While we have synergy with all the security agencies, and we're able to clear most of the
*23:45.340- 23:48.980* :  camps of the Bandits so that our people can go back to their farms.
*23:49.380- 23:54.720* :  So you're basically disputing the numbers gotten from international organizations?
*23:54.940- 23:59.480* :  The season has just started. Why are you getting the numbers? That you can rely on to say that
*23:59.480- 24:03.380* :  the number is on the increase. Go to the villages now. Find out from the villages.
*24:04.660- 24:08.600* :  But families like Jamilas are still waiting to go home to their farms.
*24:09.080- 24:13.780* :  Until the country's security and economic issues are overcome, vulnerable children
*24:13.780- 24:15.200* :  are suffering the consequences.
*24:17.320- 24:20.480* :  The report by Medina Mashanu in Northern Nigeria.
*24:21.520- 24:26.720* :  Three months after Iran's hard-line president, Ebrahim Reisi, was killed in a helicopter crash,
*24:26.720- 24:31.100* :  the man who's replaced him, a more moderate figure, Masud Pesyschian,
*24:31.100- 24:37.300* :  has presented his new cabinet to Parliament for approval. Mr Pesyschian has nominated a
*24:37.300- 24:42.360* :  Western friendly diplomat to be foreign minister, but only one woman for a cabinet position
*24:42.820- 24:44.680* :  with all the other posts going to men.
*24:45.300- 24:48.620* :  Cervash Adlan from BBC Persian told me more about the new cabinet,
*24:49.140- 24:53.560* :  and what it means for hopes of a thought in Iran's relations with the West.
*24:54.280- 25:00.400* :  So there are 19 portfolios in this cabinet. Most of them have gone to moderate figures,
*25:00.400- 25:05.960* :  but some are still occupied by hardliners or conservatives. We use the terms interchangeably
*25:05.960- 25:11.400* :  in Iranian politics because it's so factional. On one hand, you have pragmatists and moderates,
*25:11.400- 25:15.540* :  and the other hand, you have hardliners. And this president, President Pesyschian,
*25:16.020- 25:21.900* :  won on a reformist pragmatic ticket. So a lot of his constituencies and people who voted for him are
*25:21.900- 25:27.920* :  very unhappy about some of those portfolios important ones that have gone to the hardliners,
*25:28.380- 25:32.760* :  and also the fact that there's only one ministry that's been given to a woman,
*25:33.280- 25:38.620* :  the second time in the history of the Islamic Republic, and also the fact that none of the
*25:38.780- 25:46.220* :  religious or ethnic minorities are represented. I suppose this reflects the fact that the Iranian
*25:46.220- 25:51.900* :  president is trying to please his supporters, those who wanted more moderate policies,
*25:51.900- 25:57.100* :  but also trying to find a way to work with the supreme leader and hardliners who hold the real
*25:57.100- 26:03.160* :  power in Iran. Absolutely. That's the dilemma that he has. So the question everyone is asking is
*26:03.700- 26:09.100* :  whether a government cabinet should be a shareholder limited or should it be a government of
*26:09.100- 26:14.980* :  national unity, and there are different approaches that you can talk about. Previously, when you had
*26:14.980- 26:21.180* :  a president usually belonging to the reformist faction, when they took over, the politics was very
*26:21.180- 26:27.660* :  factional. So everyone who came in the government represented that viewpoint of the reformist
*26:27.660- 26:32.740* :  faction. But now this government has decided to take a different approach. It doesn't want to be so
*26:32.740- 26:39.300* :  confrontational. It recognizes the need to, there's no such thing as coalition building in Iran.
*26:39.300- 26:44.100* :  So this might also be considered by proponents of his approach to be an exercise and coalition
*26:44.100- 26:49.800* :  building, but there are also some critics as well who say that a president really doesn't hold
*26:49.800- 26:54.960* :  the leverage of power, and the person who's really in charge is a supreme leader at the revolutionary
*26:56.140- 27:01.380* :  Sea of Ash Adlan from BBC Persian. A draft law that would allow girls as young as
*27:01.380- 27:07.600* :  nine to be married has sparked protests in Iraq over the past week. Women's rights activists say
*27:07.600- 27:13.820* :  the proposal, which is backed by conservative sheer Muslim politicians, would legalize child rape.
*27:14.420- 27:19.080* :  If it becomes law, Iraqis will be allowed to choose between the religious authorities or the
*27:19.080- 27:24.720* :  civil judiciary for decisions on family affairs. The age of marriage for boys will also be lowered
*27:24.720- 27:31.340* :  to 15. I heard more from Christina Lam, the chief foreign correspondent for the Sunday Times newspaper.
*27:32.140- 27:38.780* :  At the moment, the minimum age for marriage in Iraq is 18, which it has been since 1959.
*27:39.840- 27:47.080* :  But in fact, a lot of marriages are happening younger than that. And those marriages are not
*27:47.080- 27:55.720* :  legal marriages that have been conducted by religious authorities. So what the idea of this
*27:56.680- 28:04.980* :  bill is to try and almost legalize those marriages, which are not legal, by giving people a choice
*28:04.980- 28:11.740* :  of whether they go to the judiciary or religious authorities. But I mean, the fact is it will mean
*28:12.940- 28:18.340* :  that girls, because the religious authorities will marry girls as young as nine, that you're
*28:19.040- 28:25.580* :  basically legalizing child marriage. And the people that are favoring Iraq's parliament is
*28:25.580- 28:33.160* :  dominated by conservative sheer politicians who really have been doing a number of things which
*28:33.160- 28:40.920* :  look to be rolling back rights of women and also the ELGBTQ community. And they've also spared
*28:40.920- 28:46.180* :  protests. There's been quite a backlash to this in Iraq. Yes, absolutely. They've been protests
*28:46.400- 28:54.420* :  and streets in Baghdad and other cities, a lot of outcry on social media. People are very worried
*28:54.420- 28:59.980* :  about it. One of the things that's going on in Iraq too is there's a lot of children out of
*29:00.040- 29:07.400* :  school in Iraq. 3.2 million children do not go to school. So the two things are connected really
*29:07.400- 29:15.560* :  if girls were still in school that would give them a measure of protection. And that's the key
*29:15.560- 29:22.700* :  to it, isn't it? There's a lot of poverty in Iraq. And in the 20 years since the US led invasion
*29:22.700- 29:29.000* :  that toppled Saddam Hussein, child marriage has been steadily increasing there. Yeah, it has,
*29:29.080- 29:35.160* :  and that's why some people are arguing that it's better to do this. I mean, it's quite complicated
*29:35.500- 29:41.640* :  in that all these girls who are being married through religious authorities and don't have
*29:41.640- 29:47.580* :  a civil marriage certificate are that denied a whole lot of other rights because, for example,
*29:47.580- 29:53.760* :  to give birth in a state hospital in Iraq, you have to prove that you're married. If you want to
*29:53.760- 30:01.580* :  apply for, you know, inheritance or any kind of spousal allowances, you can't get those unless
*30:01.580- 30:08.360* :  you have a civil marriage contract. What they would actually be doing is legalizing marriages that
*30:08.580- 30:14.140* :  in many people's views and certainly in my view, it should not be legal. It shouldn't be okay to
*30:14.180- 30:18.540* :  marry a girl of the age of nine. Christine Atlam,
*30:19.240- 30:25.460* :  Berwanda's president, Paul Gagami, has been sworn in for a fourth term. He won over 99 percent of
*30:25.460- 30:31.340* :  the votes in last month's election in which he faced no meaningful opposition. Mr. Gagami
*30:31.340- 30:37.900* :  has been in charge of the country since the end of the 1994 genocide. Our Africa editor is Will Ross.
*30:41.140- 30:45.840* :  A 21-gun salute as Paul Gagami begins what's effectively his fourth decade in charge of
*30:45.840- 30:50.100* :  Berwanda. Many African heads of state were at the ceremony, but not the leader next door,
*30:50.100- 30:55.360* :  Congo's Felix Chisakadi. There have been peace talks to try to end the animosity between the two men
*30:55.360- 31:00.780* :  because it's been fueling conflict in eastern Congo. Paul Gagami appeared to criticize Mr. Chisakadi
*31:00.780- 31:04.560* :  for failing to help defeat Rwanda and Rebels based there. Will Ross.
*31:05.460- 31:10.460* :  Wild elephants and humans are increasingly coming into conflict in parts of India as the habitats
*31:10.460- 31:15.700* :  for the huge mammals are shrinking. Hundreds of people and elephants have died in recent years as
*31:15.700- 31:21.660* :  humans encroaching territory the animals have traditionally roamed on. Now a new app has been
*31:21.660- 31:27.000* :  launched by the state of Assam to try to reduce such deaths. It will warn people of approaching
*31:27.000- 31:31.280* :  herds of elephants to help them get out of the way. Stephanie Prentice reports.
*31:32.060- 31:37.980* :  Assam in India's northeast has one of the highest populations of wild elephants of any of
*31:37.980- 31:45.700* :  India's states. A source of pride but also of concern. While most interactions between humans
*31:45.700- 31:51.740* :  and elephants are peaceful, the results when they're not can be catastrophic and even fatal
*31:51.740- 31:59.520* :  with an average of 80 elephants and 70 humans killed each year. Until now Assam's government has
*31:59.520- 32:05.380* :  recommended installing electric fences to keep elephants away from towns and villages. Now it's
*32:05.380- 32:11.640* :  stepped up its approach with a new app giving people a number of tools based on an early warning
*32:11.640- 32:18.080* :  system. First is a tracking element that works in real time so communities can be alerted to
*32:18.080- 32:24.720* :  approaching herds. Second is advice on how people can take evasive action and there's also a
*32:24.720- 32:30.420* :  logging system for incidents so villagers can apply for compensation quickly if their property
*32:30.420- 32:36.060* :  is damaged. The app was designed by a team of conservationists and will initially be given to
*32:36.060- 32:41.980* :  areas with high intensity human elephant conflict before being rolled out across the northeast.
*32:42.620- 32:47.820* :  Stephanie Prentice. Now let's return to the Olympics which have ended in the French capital with
*32:47.820- 32:53.580* :  a spectacular closing ceremony on Sunday. As well as an impressive medals hall, Paris has also
*32:53.580- 32:59.820* :  held into its title as a city of love. We saw the five Olympic rings but there have been quite a
*32:59.820- 33:06.840* :  few other rings as well as several athletes proposed after competing. Harry Blyh looks back at some
*33:06.840- 33:13.540* :  of the games love stories. This summer of Olympic love began even before the opening ceremony.
*33:14.000- 33:18.620* :  While a group of more than 50 Argentinian athletes were taking a group photo,
*33:19.080- 33:24.620* :  handball player Pablo Simmonet got on his knee and proposed to his longtime girlfriend
*33:24.620- 33:31.420* :  field hockey player Maria Pilar Campoy. Then came the opening ceremony on the rivercent.
*33:31.420- 33:38.680* :  But for Italian high jumper Gianmarco Tambieri it did not get off to a good start. While waving
*33:38.680- 33:45.160* :  the Italian flag on his team's boat cruising along the water in the rain, his wedding ring fell
*33:45.160- 33:51.540* :  off and bounced off the boat into the sand. In a post on Instagram, Tambieri apologised to his
*33:51.540- 33:57.340* :  wife Chiara Bontempi. He suggested that there might be something poetic about what happened
*33:57.340- 34:03.540* :  and that if she wanted to she could throw her ring in too. He wrote that then the rings would be
*34:03.540- 34:09.420* :  together forever and they'd have one more excuse to renew their vows. During the games,
*34:09.420- 34:13.480* :  there have been plenty of moments between loved ones cheering each other on,
*34:13.480- 34:19.020* :  consoling each other after a loss or celebrating together with videos of athletes running
*34:19.020- 34:22.280* :  straight into their partner's arms all over social media.
*34:28.500- 34:32.960* :  And it seems the city of love inspired something extra for some of those moments.
*34:32.960- 34:38.900* :  The American Roeer just in best took Team USA's first gold for rowing this Olympics
*34:38.900- 34:45.160* :  after receiving his medal surrounded by family and friends and live on the today show on NBC.
*34:45.340- 34:51.980* :  He proposed to his girlfriend Lany Duncan and in her home country after breaking the European
*34:51.980- 34:58.080* :  record for the 3,000 metre steeple chase, the French athlete Alice Finneau took one of her
*34:58.080- 35:04.320* :  Olympic pins as a makeshift ring and proposed to her boyfriend the Spanish triathlete Bruno Martinez
*35:04.320- 35:10.920* :  Barguela. Finneau said she told herself that if she ran in under nine minutes with nine being her
*35:10.920- 35:15.760* :  lucky number and that she and Bruno have been together for nine years, she would propose.
*35:15.760- 35:21.200* :  And of course, he said yes. Harry Blie on the love stories at the Olympic Games.
*35:21.340- 35:25.540* :  Don't forget the Paralympics begin in Paris on the 28th of August.
*35:28.840- 35:33.240* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*35:33.480- 35:37.360* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered, you can send us an email.
