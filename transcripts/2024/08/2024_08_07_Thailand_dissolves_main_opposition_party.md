*00:23.680- 00:28.500* :  running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walls. But do the vice-presidential candidates really
*00:28.500- 00:34.380* :  influence the election? And how will Tim Walls and JD Vance impact the final months of the race?
*00:35.600- 00:40.420* :  The Global Story brings you unique perspectives from BBC journalists around the world.

*00:47.860- 00:51.300* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:53.600- 00:59.840* :  I'm Rachel Wright and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 7th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:00.560- 01:05.240* :  Thailand's biggest opposition party has been banned over its plans to change the strict laws
*01:05.240- 01:11.380* :  about criticizing the monarchy. President Putin condemns the latest incursion into Russian territory
*01:11.380- 01:17.960* :  by troops crossing from Ukraine. The North Korean leader orders 300,000 young people to help clear
*01:17.960- 01:24.260* :  up after devastating floods. Also in this podcast,
*01:24.760- 01:29.120* :  are we having our minds taken off the staff that should be capturing our attention?
*01:29.400- 01:32.340* :  That's one theory. Another one is that he just loves goats.
*01:32.820- 01:37.160* :  As two new banks he's appearing in London, we search for meaning in the murals
*01:37.560- 01:43.480* :  and in Australia, blew the cartoon puppy and a large-scale theft of commemorative coins.
*01:48.960- 01:53.500* :  We start in Thailand where the constitutional court has ordered the dissolution of the
*01:53.500- 01:59.120* :  biggest opposition party because of its campaign to amend a law that protects the monarchy from
*01:59.120- 02:04.680* :  criticism. The court had ruled earlier this year that the campaign by move forward was
*02:04.680- 02:10.520* :  unconstitutional and undermined Thailand's political system. These activists at the party
*02:10.520- 02:13.220* :  had courtes reacted with anger and sadness.
*02:16.280- 02:18.580* :  I didn't expect that the result would be like this.
*02:18.940- 02:24.420* :  I'm sad, but I don't regret anything. Ultimately, we as people will keep on fighting.
*02:28.200- 02:31.880* :  It's not okay. I cannot accept this. The party should not be dissolved.
*02:32.560- 02:37.540* :  You that court should investigate and verify the evidence. How can you be sure that the evidence is
*02:37.900- 02:42.740* :  real? Speaking at a news conference after the verdict, the leader of move forward,
*02:42.740- 02:46.980* :  Pisser Lim DeRunrat, said a new party would be announced on Friday.
*02:47.680- 02:56.060* :  We'll make sure that the political project continues in a new vehicle, which will be
*02:56.060- 03:03.260* :  introduced on August 9th, which I will not be part of anymore. It's entirely up to my colleagues
*03:03.260- 03:08.800* :  at the back to get together and decide on the party, the party name, and the next leader,
*03:08.800- 03:14.020* :  so I can't comment on that at the moment. I spoke to our South East Asia correspondent, Jonathan
*03:14.020- 03:19.180* :  Head, who said the dissolution of the party was expected. This is a court that has a very
*03:19.180- 03:23.520* :  long track record of doing exactly this to other parties, although this is the first time they've
*03:23.520- 03:28.340* :  used the issue of the monarchy, which is a very serious one, as a justification for it.
*03:28.720- 03:35.480* :  And it really underlines the very stark difference in views between those who want change in
*03:35.480- 03:40.060* :  Thailand, those who are younger, more open-minded, and those who are determined to defend the
*03:40.060- 03:45.360* :  status quo. If you look at what the judges said about move forward, it wasn't just that they
*03:45.360- 03:50.000* :  proposed amending this law. They interpreted move forwards. I mean, these were very mild proposals.
*03:50.000- 03:54.340* :  You didn't move forward, it wasn't proposing abolishing the law. It just said, as many others
*03:54.340- 03:58.280* :  have said, the punishments are incredibly harsh, which they are. People go to jail for
*03:58.280- 04:03.520* :  decades. But the court interpreted that, essentially, as trying to bring down the entire monarchical
*04:03.520- 04:08.900* :  system. It claimed that move forwards actions had shown hostility against the monarchy, it had weakened
*04:08.900- 04:14.040* :  it, and was exploiting it to get votes, and pitting the monarchy in a conflict against the people.
*04:14.480- 04:18.960* :  And so it's regard, and this is a very, very serious move, and justifying this drastic measure.
*04:19.280- 04:24.440* :  But people now in time know that this is the role the constitutional court is expected to play,
*04:24.440- 04:31.740* :  is an ultra-conservative, unelected body backed by the military, by royalists, which it will move
*04:31.740- 04:37.620* :  against any political party within the democratic system that is perceived as somehow threatening
*04:37.620- 04:40.640* :  the established order. And that's the message that comes out of today's verdict.
*04:41.140- 04:45.280* :  What are these opposition, some of whom are incredibly popular, obviously? What are they going to do
*04:45.280- 04:51.440* :  next? Well, the MPs, most of them, are not covered by the ban. Only those parties top leaders
*04:51.440- 04:56.000* :  of ban from politics. So, in under time as rather peculiar political system, you can simply
*04:56.000- 05:00.820* :  slide into another party. And remember, move forward itself came out of a previous reformist
*05:00.820- 05:05.060* :  party called Future Forward that was also dissolved on different grounds four years ago,
*05:05.460- 05:10.460* :  and so the same thing will happen again. And I wonder whether those who've determined to
*05:10.460- 05:14.200* :  crush it, and there are those on the conservative side who'd like to, have really thought this
*05:14.200- 05:19.040* :  through, because the last time it's predecessor was banned, move forward, the new party actually
*05:19.040- 05:23.960* :  did much better in the next election. When we have another election in three years time, it'll be
*05:23.960- 05:29.360* :  very interesting to see what this new successor party will do. But there will be a constant battle
*05:29.360- 05:34.340* :  now in Thailand between those saying we must have changed Thailand as aging its economy is slowing
*05:34.340- 05:38.520* :  down. We must have a more flexible system one where we don't have this enormously powerful
*05:38.520- 05:42.720* :  unaccountable monarchy. And those who are saying you just can't touch it, it's sacred.
*05:43.040- 05:46.900* :  For now, the conservatives clearly have the upper hand. They have not just the constitutional
*05:46.960- 05:51.320* :  court, but they haven't ascended. A new Senate has just been chosen, which is ultra-royalist
*05:51.320- 05:54.940* :  as well. So it's going to be a very tough battle for those who want to continue this reformist
*05:54.940- 06:01.940* :  campaign. Jonathan Head in Bangkok. President Vladimir Putin has called an incursion of Ukrainian
*06:01.940- 06:08.180* :  forces into Russian territory a major provocation. Speaking in a televised meeting with government
*06:08.180- 06:14.020* :  officials, Mr Putin said Ukraine had conducted indiscriminate shelling of civilians in the
*06:14.020- 06:18.820* :  Kursk region, where the Russian army says it's been battling Ukrainian fighters for a second
*06:18.820- 06:24.860* :  day. Earlier, the Russian health ministry said more than 20 people had been wounded. I asked Danny
*06:24.860- 06:30.740* :  Aberhard, our Europe regional editor, to fill us in on the latest. This incursion started on
*06:30.740- 06:36.960* :  Tuesday, Rachel, and initially the Russian Ministry of Defense seemed to suggest that these
*06:36.960- 06:42.620* :  forces, whoever they are, had been repelled. But since then, it's said that operations are ongoing
*06:42.620- 06:47.180* :  and continued overnight to destroy what it called units of the Ukrainian armed forces.
*06:47.680- 06:53.060* :  It said it prevented them from advancing deep into Russian territory. Now, Russian military
*06:53.060- 06:58.200* :  bloggers have suggested that some of these advances got as far as 15 kilometers inside Russia,
*06:58.660- 07:03.360* :  which is quite a long way. And Russia's Ministry of Defense says it's inflicted large losses.
*07:03.800- 07:09.040* :  The local governor, Alexei Smirnoff, says the situation is under control, often a phrase used
*07:09.040- 07:13.880* :  when things aren't under control. He's saying that evacuations have started of people in border
*07:13.880- 07:18.860* :  areas. He's also called for blood. And he said that teams, medical teams have been arriving from
*07:18.860- 07:22.840* :  elsewhere in Russia. So, obviously, they're to deal with casualties.
*07:23.320- 07:27.860* :  Who do we think these troops are? Because previous incursions have involved Russian armed groups
*07:27.860- 07:34.160* :  who are anti-Putin. Well, it's not totally clear at this stage, as I say, Russia says it's Ukrainian
*07:34.160- 07:40.960* :  armed troops. But last year, there were incursions across the Russian border by two different
*07:41.700- 07:46.040* :  anti-Cremlin Russian groups. So, one was called the Russian Volunteer Corps. The other one was
*07:46.040- 07:51.040* :  the Freedom of Russia Legion. They're based in Ukraine. And they went across the border in Briansk,
*07:51.120- 07:57.380* :  Belgrade, and Kursk. Those were repelled. But we don't know at the moment who was doing this,
*07:57.380- 08:04.200* :  Ukraine hasn't said anything officially. So, we're waiting to see what, obviously, they often
*08:04.200- 08:10.560* :  don't comment on their actual military actions. But have we any idea what the aims of the Ukrainian
*08:10.560- 08:16.440* :  incursion might be? Because this is unusual, isn't it? Yes. So, we don't know. It may well be that
*08:16.440- 08:22.820* :  they're trying to stop attacks from Russia across into Sumi. Now, Sumi, Ukrainian region that
*08:22.820- 08:29.400* :  borders Kursk, has been targeted relentlessly by Russian bombardments. And Sumi itself was
*08:29.400- 08:34.880* :  invaded in the full-scale invasion. Russian troops went into Sumi, occupied it, and then later
*08:34.880- 08:40.580* :  withdrew. It could also be a diversionary move to try to get Russian forces redeployed from
*08:40.580- 08:45.700* :  elsewhere where Ukrainian forces are under pressure. Are you a regional editor, Danny Aberhard?
*08:46.620- 08:53.760* :  Now, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ordered a 300,000 strong citizens army to deploy to
*08:53.760- 09:00.740* :  areas devastated by floods. Weeks of torrential rain have triggered widespread flooding and landslides
*09:00.740- 09:06.880* :  across vast suites of the secretive communist state. I found out more from our Asia-Pacific editor,
*09:06.880- 09:13.740* :  Celia Hatten. The North Korean leader appeared in the center of Pyongyang and was basically surrounded
*09:13.740- 09:24.540* :  by adoring crowds as he sent off these 300,000 loyal youth workers to go and restore part
*09:24.540- 09:30.300* :  of the countryside, the country's North. He described it as being a gigantic revolutionary
*09:30.300- 09:36.800* :  construction campaign and basically said this group that he described as a youth shock brigade
*09:36.800- 09:42.520* :  was going to give a facelift to the region. Now, essentially, they're going to go and rebuild
*09:42.520- 09:50.600* :  homes. They're set to rebuild 4,400 homes. We know, according to official North Korean statistics
*09:50.600- 09:56.680* :  that more than 4,000 homes were destroyed by the flood. So he's sending out this very loyal group.
*09:56.680- 10:00.280* :  I wouldn't necessarily say they're all volunteers because I don't think they have
*10:00.680- 10:05.540* :  under North Korean North Korea's authoritative government. They don't really have the ability to say
*10:05.540- 10:11.040* :  no, but they're being sent to the north of the country to give it a facelift. And is this area
*10:11.040- 10:17.100* :  of the country a rather a politically shaky part? Absolutely. So this part of the country
*10:17.100- 10:23.400* :  used to be quite open, frankly, because it's on China's border. And so for decades, North Koreans
*10:23.400- 10:28.880* :  used to be able to go across the border, there's quite porous border, go illegally into China,
*10:28.880- 10:34.120* :  maybe work, maybe spread some news about what was happening inside North Korea, take some news
*10:34.120- 10:40.640* :  back in, and people crossed relatively often. After the pandemic and during the pandemic,
*10:40.640- 10:46.320* :  Kim Jong-un took that opportunity to really seal up the border. So people can't cross anymore.
*10:46.320- 10:50.960* :  That means they're trapped when flooding is happening. They have no way to help themselves.
*10:50.960- 10:56.260* :  And also that part of the country is really cut off from the rest of the world and the rest
*10:56.260- 11:01.860* :  of North Korea. And so if people there are very unhappy about the extent of the flooding flooded
*11:01.860- 11:07.460* :  farmland, they can't feed themselves. This is a way for Kim Jong-un to send politically loyal
*11:07.460- 11:11.900* :  people to that part of the country and to make a big show about the fact that he's the one
*11:11.900- 11:18.460* :  ordering the rebuilding. Celia Hutton, the Bangladeshi economist and Nobel Peace Prize winner,
*11:18.460- 11:23.880* :  Mohammed Yunus, has called for calm and new elections in the country after agreeing to lead
*11:23.880- 11:28.900* :  an entering government. Mr. Yunus said trust in the government should be restored quickly
*11:28.900- 11:33.640* :  and a plan for new elections drawn up. Our South Asia Regional Editor,
*11:33.640- 11:38.960* :  Ambassador Netharajan, has more details. The micro-credit pioneer, Mohammed Yunus,
*11:38.960- 11:43.500* :  is currently in Paris and scheduled to arrive in the Bangladeshi capital on Thursday.
*11:44.140- 11:50.040* :  I had a vis-return. Mr. Yunus issued a statement repeatedly urging people to refrain from all
*11:50.040- 11:55.700* :  kinds of violence. He warned that if they took the path of violence, everything would be destroyed.
*11:56.240- 12:00.420* :  There have been reports of looting and revenge attacks on police and supporters of
*12:00.420- 12:06.820* :  the ousted Prime Minister, Shaykassina. Bangladesh has been in turmoil since she resigned and
*12:06.820- 12:12.560* :  fled to India on Monday following weeks of unrest. For now, student protesters have taken
*12:12.560- 12:18.800* :  responsibility for directing traffic and maintaining calm. The police were responsible for the
*12:18.800- 12:24.120* :  crackdown on anti-government protesters or on strike, fearing for their safety.
*12:24.800- 12:30.000* :  Ambassador Netharajan, as tensions continue to rise in the Middle East, people in
*12:30.000- 12:36.180* :  Haifa in the north of Israel are bracing for a major attack. The port city lies just 20 miles
*12:36.180- 12:41.660* :  from the border with Lebanon. Our correspondent Jenny Hill has been to Haifa to assess the mood
*12:42.020- 12:46.800* :  and visit a purpose-built underground hospital which could shelter thousands of people.
*12:51.500- 12:57.460* :  I am deep underground in the northern Israeli city of Haifa. This is normally a multi-story
*12:57.460- 13:04.960* :  car park, but there are no vehicles here. Instead, I'm looking at scores and scores of hospital beds.
*13:07.020- 13:12.580* :  If there's an attack on Haifa, this vast bunker will shelter the sick and take in the injured.
*13:13.260- 13:17.700* :  When, when, when it's going to happen, nobody knows we talk about it a lot.
*13:18.240- 13:23.260* :  Dr Avi Weissman is the director of the Rambam Medical Centre, which runs the facility.
*13:23.900- 13:28.800* :  We're in general people are optimistic, we hope it's going to be in short duration.
*13:30.000- 13:32.560* :  So, if people are a little bit anxious.
*13:35.580- 13:41.020* :  There are operating theatres here, a maternity ward, even pictures of flowers on the concrete
*13:41.020- 13:45.120* :  walls, and supplies to keep everyone going for three days.
*13:46.960- 13:53.080* :  They tell us here they're fully prepared for an attack. Israel insists it's ready for any
*13:53.080- 14:00.000* :  eventuality and yet you can sense the unease. You can feel the fear.
*14:00.620- 14:06.540* :  This port city is busy, vibrant, but people in Haifa tell us they do feel vulnerable.
*14:07.400- 14:13.260* :  Lebanon and Hezbollah's rockets are close by. Look out over the shipping lanes here,
*14:13.900- 14:15.300* :  and you can see the border.
*14:18.340- 14:23.520* :  It's a ticking time bomb any minute now. It could be like an alarm, will I die, will I have time
*14:23.520- 14:28.920* :  to go home to my family? Will there be traffic and trains? Will I be alone here?
*14:30.060- 14:35.360* :  The authorities here seem very keen to say that Israel is completely prepared for any
*14:35.360- 14:40.860* :  eventuality. That doesn't seem to reassure you. I don't trust them. I don't.
*14:41.100- 14:48.380* :  I think that you can never be fully prepared for a scenario like this.
*14:50.520- 14:54.420* :  But as he delicately pours cappuccinos in his newly opened coffee shop,
*14:55.000- 14:58.680* :  Lloyd tells us that the constant threat has dulled his fear.
*15:02.840- 15:03.500* :  Are you afraid?
*15:12.360- 15:13.840* :  I'm not sleeping well at night.
*15:14.740- 15:20.240* :  You know you have is the mayor of Haifa. The weight of responsibility hoods his eyes.
*15:20.820- 15:25.860* :  He's in his 80s and ran this city when Israel was at war with Lebanon almost 20 years ago.
*15:26.560- 15:31.340* :  I'm very sad about it that there is a fork in the Middle East,
*15:32.240- 15:39.360* :  with their leaders are only concerned about destruction, killing, fighting instead of building.
*15:41.900- 15:47.740* :  So Haifa's doctors continue to prepare their fortress hospital. But international diplomacy is
*15:47.740- 15:52.740* :  ongoing. Hope still. I'll never have to use it. Jenny Hill.
*15:55.740- 15:59.700* :  Still to come in this podcast. We're doing our absolute best to try to recover
*15:59.700- 16:04.380* :  those coins and put them back into circulation. Strike Force Bandit, the police
*16:04.380- 16:10.080* :  operation in Australia, to track down thousands of stolen limited edition cartoon coins.
*16:21.000- 16:26.500* :  I'm Katrina Perry from the Global Story Podcast. Kamala Harris announces her running
*16:26.500- 16:31.540* :  mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walls. But do the vice presidential candidates really influence
*16:31.540- 16:36.940* :  the election? And how will Tim Walls and JD Vance impact the final months of the race?
*16:38.160- 16:42.980* :  The Global Story brings you unique perspectives from BBC journalists around the world.
*16:43.580- 16:45.540* :  Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
*16:47.660- 16:59.940* :  Iman Halif is into the welterweight boxing final at the Olympics. The Algerian boxer came into
*16:59.940- 17:05.260* :  the games under a cloud of controversy after she was banned from participating at last year's
*17:05.260- 17:11.460* :  World Boxing Championships. Back then, the governing body in charge, the IBA, said she'd failed
*17:11.460- 17:17.520* :  gender eligibility tests. The International Olympic Committee, which severed ties with the IBA,
*17:17.520- 17:24.360* :  cleared Halif and another athlete to compete. But the story has become even bigger after her opening
*17:24.360- 17:30.400* :  round opponent, Angela Karini quit, saying she had never been hit so hard and that she had to
*17:30.400- 17:36.940* :  protect her life. It sparked a polarized debate on social media and the IOC came out in support
*17:36.940- 17:43.340* :  of Halif, saying that she's a woman and questioning the legitimacy of the tests the IBA conducted.
*17:43.980- 17:49.740* :  Her uncle, Rashid Jabur, spoke to BBC Arabic from the Algerian city of Teoret.
*17:54.760- 17:59.940* :  Her hobbies in childhood were soccer and cross-country running. And she always ranked first.
*17:59.940- 18:06.040* :  She had an aptitude for all sports and her body is suited for various sports. She was also brave
*18:06.040- 18:12.300* :  and didn't accept defeat. We used to buy her things for girls and she looked forward to buying
*18:12.300- 18:17.200* :  these things. She was very feminine and we never doubted whether she was a boy or a girl.
*18:17.760- 18:23.700* :  But from a young age, we discovered that she has courage and was braver than boys her age. For
*18:23.700- 18:30.540* :  example, when she fell, she wouldn't cry and she was faster than the boys. Imman's favorite hobby
*18:30.540- 18:36.420* :  is horse riding and she loves sport. The most important thing for her is to practice sport. She
*18:36.420- 18:45.840* :  doesn't need or want anything but to practice sport. Well, France has a large Algerian population.
*18:45.980- 18:50.340* :  BBC Sports Reporter Isaac Fanning has been speaking to some of them in Paris.
*18:51.140- 18:55.320* :  So I was told about Barbours by an Algerian friend who told me that there's a big
*18:55.860- 19:00.280* :  Algerian community. I've just got enough of the train here just walking down the street. I can see
*19:00.280- 19:07.500* :  a few restaurants, lots of people milling about in these streets outside the station. You can see
*19:07.500- 19:13.220* :  actually a few Algerian flags and a few people wearing Algerian jerseys. Let me head into this
*19:13.360- 19:16.180* :  restaurant here and see if I can have a word of someone.
*19:16.980- 19:21.560* :  Paul A. Boulonglie. Can I ask you some questions about Imman Khalif?
*19:21.640- 19:27.020* :  Yes. Okay. My name is Mohmette. I'm from Algeria. Have you been watching the Olympics?
*19:27.020- 19:35.840* :  Yes, of course. Every night I watch the Olympic Games. I am proud of Imman Khalif. It's a very good
*19:35.840- 19:42.260* :  woman. Every people talking about the situation of Imman Khalif because of all the words
*19:42.280- 19:50.260* :  speak about this situation. We have to stay with Imman Khalif to defend her congratulation
*19:51.140- 19:55.160* :  and she will win the gold and one, two, three without a gerry.
*19:55.780- 20:02.500* :  Mamad made me an absolutely delightful Algerian sandwich and it's filled me to walk around Barbours,
*20:02.500- 20:08.740* :  have a chat with a few people every time I speak to them in my broken French. I say can you
*20:08.740- 20:14.160* :  speak to me and they say I don't speak English but when I say Imman Khalif's name there is
*20:14.620- 20:19.860* :  recognition. People know who she is which is crazy given the fact that before the Olympics
*20:19.860- 20:29.460* :  began she probably had about 10,000 followers. Now she is onto 1.3 million followers and it's
*20:29.460- 20:35.340* :  all because of everything she's been through and the fact that she is an Olympic medalist.
*20:36.460- 20:42.820* :  We hope she wins like the final. You know the drama that comes then everything. She proved
*20:42.820- 20:49.200* :  everything wrong. She is like our own hero. What do you make of everything that she's had to
*20:49.200- 20:56.020* :  deal with this week? They insult her, they like bullied her and everything but she stays
*20:56.020- 21:03.340* :  strong and you know she wins and obviously if she can win gold how proud would you be of her?
*21:04.420- 21:10.400* :  Very very very proud like you know that's like an honor for our country and our for us.
*21:11.120- 21:18.740* :  InshaAllah she wins. InshaAllah. I think she's a woman she was born as a woman. I've seen a lot
*21:18.740- 21:24.940* :  of pictures of her as a kid and yes I think she doesn't deserve all of the hate.
*21:25.580- 21:32.180* :  That report by Isaac Fanning enjoying an Algerian sandwich in Paris. Deep in the Bolivian
*21:32.180- 21:38.340* :  Amazon rainforest lived the Tumani people, a nomad semi-isolated native tribe in the north of
*21:38.340- 21:44.280* :  the South American nation. Little was known about the Tumani tribe until researchers became interested
*21:44.280- 21:50.340* :  in a particular fact. The older people from this community age more slowly compared with other
*21:51.220- 21:56.100* :  populations. They also maintain their physical and mental health until very late in life.
*21:56.480- 22:03.740* :  So what's their secret? BBC Mundo's Alejandro Mian and Jorge Perez-Valerie travel there to find out.
*22:07.140- 22:12.320* :  The Mori is slow moving waters of Maniko River, winds and six sacks through the Bolivian
*22:12.320- 22:18.500* :  lowlands. Traveling in a narrow wooden canoe fitted with an outboard motor we pass families of
*22:18.500- 22:25.140* :  similar craft ferrying large stacks of bananas. It's in us a string of communities and banks of
*22:25.140- 22:33.480* :  the Maniki that the Chimane people have thrived. We are dropped seven hours of river, then begin
*22:33.480- 22:41.120* :  walking down a dirt path through the jungle. It's not long before we meet Martina Cantinate,
*22:41.300- 22:49.960* :  a Chimane grandmother. She's hard at work. Martina has done a banana tree with a machete,
*22:50.360- 22:55.460* :  then carries the rack through the jungle, the slung over her back, the strap supported by her head.
*22:56.380- 23:00.060* :  We try to walk with her back to her village, we are some breathless.
*23:00.620- 23:00.980* :  Martina,
*23:02.360- 23:06.760* :  and hard to ask her to slow down for us.
*23:07.000- 23:11.000* :  We then ask how old is she?
*23:13.220- 23:20.560* :  She doesn't remember. Age seems irrelevant here, but once at her home after a drink of
*23:20.680- 23:28.140* :  Chija. She looked for her ID to show us that she is officially 84 years old.
*23:30.020- 23:33.280* :  In the town of Samborca, the closest to the Chimane territory,
*23:33.280- 23:39.460* :  American anthropologist Hilar Kaplan has been studying the health of this ethnic group for two
*23:39.460- 23:45.360* :  decades. When they compared the data to other populations around the world, Kaplan and his
*23:45.360- 23:51.180* :  colleagues found that 85 percent of these older people had zero risk of heart disease.
*23:51.800- 23:59.760* :  One of the things we could say is a 75-year-old Chimane's arteries were more like a 50-year-old
*23:59.760- 24:06.840* :  American's arteries. We joined one group of Chimane as they make a trip to the hospital.
*24:07.140- 24:10.400* :  In the city of Trinidad, about 150 miles away,
*24:12.240- 24:18.100* :  they received city scans and a variety of other tests. But while their ancestral diet and
*24:18.100- 24:23.620* :  daily routine formed two pillars of their longevity, researchers now believe there is a more
*24:23.620- 24:25.780* :  tragic foundation to their resilience.
*24:27.540- 24:29.300* :  And you? How many children did you have?
*24:30.760- 24:35.160* :  That's Dr. Daniel Rodriguez. He and the team are currently looking at the impact
*24:35.160- 24:41.220* :  infections of bacteria has had on the Chimane's immune system and how it protects them from arterial
*24:45.380- 24:50.120* :  diseases. One woman answers, she had nine children and three more that passed away.
*24:50.880- 24:55.720* :  High exposure to infection meant that the Chimane people has suffered from high rates of
*24:55.720- 25:01.620* :  child and maternal mortality. Those that survived could have been left with greater resilience.
*25:01.700- 25:08.100* :  Whether by painful losses or healthy leaving, the Chimane feel proud to know that their
*25:08.100- 25:11.600* :  ancestral lifestyle is now a health reference beyond the jungle.
*25:12.580- 25:15.660* :  Ilda is one of the most senior members of the community.
*25:18.620- 25:23.220* :  These year my children killed a pig to celebrate that I'd send around a hundred years old.
*25:23.900- 25:26.940* :  They told me it was my birthday and that's why they had a small party.
*25:29.060- 25:33.300* :  I'm not afraid of dying. They will bury me and I will stay there.
*25:38.960- 25:46.040* :  That report from BBC Mundo. The UK's official coin maker, the Royal Mint, has begun processing
*25:46.040- 25:52.580* :  electronic waste to extract gold. A large industrial plant has been built on its site in Wales
*25:52.580- 25:58.560* :  to remove the precious metal from old circuit boards. The gold is initially being used to craft
*25:58.560- 26:05.260* :  jewelry and later it will be made into commemorative coins. Our science editor Rebecca Morrell reports.
*26:06.220- 26:12.080* :  Electronic waste, everything from old phones to dead laptops and defunct TVs is a problem that's
*26:12.080- 26:17.600* :  been piling up but for the Royal Mint it's now a valuable resource. They're processing the
*26:17.600- 26:23.260* :  circuit boards from this discarded tech in their new industrial plant. Each board contains tiny
*26:23.260- 26:29.680* :  amounts of gold and this is being extracted using chemical processes. They're hoping to take in
*26:29.680- 26:36.520* :  about 4,000 tonnes of e-waste a year. This is expected to provide up to 450 kilograms of
*26:36.520- 26:40.760* :  the precious metal. Inga Doke is head of sustainability for the Royal Mint.
*26:40.760- 26:45.680* :  What we're doing here is we're actually urban mining so we're taking a waste product that's
*26:45.680- 26:52.140* :  been produced by society and each one of us is individuals and we're mining the gold from
*26:52.140- 26:58.560* :  that waste product and starting to see the value in that finite resource. It's a big change for
*26:58.560- 27:03.720* :  the company who've been making coins for more than 1,000 years but with cash used dwindling,
*27:03.720- 27:08.040* :  the Royal Mint says this is a new way for it to make money and to save jobs.
*27:08.620- 27:13.900* :  Rebecca Morrell there on the factory turning something old into something new. Next we head to
*27:13.900- 27:17.740* :  Australia to hear about something borrowed and definitely blue.
*27:24.660- 27:31.300* :  Bluey the cartoon puppy is the inexhaustible and hugely popular star of a children's TV show.
*27:31.800- 27:37.700* :  She's endlessly curious and particularly keen on roleplay whether that's being a taxi driver,
*27:37.700- 27:44.340* :  hotel manager or mermaid but probably not a bank robber at least not until today.
*27:44.860- 27:50.740* :  That could all change now that the police have charged a man over the theft of nearly 400,000 US
*27:50.740- 27:57.660* :  dollars worth of limited edition bluey coins. Many of which remain missing as Detective Superintendent
*27:57.660- 28:02.460* :  Joseph Duayy explained at a hastily-confined police news conference.
*28:03.260- 28:08.140* :  We are certainly aware of how popular bluey is and the fact that these coins are the
*28:08.140- 28:12.160* :  theft of these coins have deprived a lot of young children and members of the community from having
*28:12.160- 28:16.900* :  access to these coins so we're doing our absolute best to try to recover these coins and put them
*28:16.900- 28:22.900* :  back into circulation. I asked Katie Watson our correspondent in Sydney what it is that makes bluey
*28:22.900- 28:29.760* :  so popular. I think it's a cartoon that both children and adults love. I think it talks to
*28:29.760- 28:35.140* :  everybody the fun that they have as a family. Certainly I think a lot of parents,
*28:35.140- 28:40.200* :  certainly here in Australia and elsewhere, feel that perhaps they feel slightly insecure I think
*28:40.200- 28:44.740* :  with how great bluey's parents are and how great parents, such great parents they are. Certainly
*28:44.740- 28:50.980* :  I think you know here it's an absolute craze and of course across the world bluey has become
*28:50.980- 28:58.560* :  hugely popular. And made into coins which were commemorative and an exclusive so they were
*28:58.560- 29:03.800* :  stolen. How did this all come to light? Well to set this into some kind of context it was back in
*29:03.800- 29:09.180* :  June there was a collection of coins that went on sale here in Australia such as the popularity
*29:09.180- 29:15.340* :  that collectors and fans they went crazy the Royal Mint diverted all its phone lines to the
*29:15.340- 29:22.740* :  sales centre when they launched it was known as bluey mania. Now what we now know is that it was
*29:22.860- 29:29.940* :  some coins that were set for a September release. They were reported stolen 64,000 of them
*29:30.440- 29:36.840* :  and Stephen John Nielsen appeared in court earlier today Wednesday arrested after a raid
*29:36.840- 29:43.200* :  charged with three counts of breaking and entering. He's alleged to be an employee of a warehouse
*29:43.200- 29:49.000* :  of the warehouse where the coins were stored and obviously there was a search warrant
*29:49.060- 29:55.640* :  in Western Sydney they found 189 coins but they're still looking for two men it's still very much
*29:55.640- 30:00.140* :  an ongoing investigation and also just to find the remainder of the coins that was stolen.
*30:00.700- 30:06.620* :  And I'm told there's a family connection to the police operation. That's right an investigation
*30:06.620- 30:11.840* :  was launched after the reports of the theft of the coins and it was called strike force bandit
*30:12.220- 30:18.000* :  that is the name of bluey's father in the television program so there is a bluey theme at their
*30:18.000- 30:24.680* :  criminal level trying to find the whereabouts of these very sought after coins. Katie Watson
*30:24.680- 30:31.680* :  in Sydney the elusive British street artist Banksy is having a busy week he's claimed responsibility
*30:31.720- 30:37.540* :  for a second new artwork in London to elephants facing each other as they poke their heads out
*30:37.540- 30:43.420* :  of blocked out windows on the side of a house in London this was the view of some who's seen it.
*30:44.020- 30:49.580* :  I think it's charming I think it's just so lovely to see two elephants having a lovely
*30:49.580- 30:58.260* :  chat looking happy. I'm a bit underwhelmed but yeah I don't know what it's really depicting but
*30:59.400- 31:04.380* :  I think it's more that it's cool to have seen it. I just love elephants so I think something like
*31:04.380- 31:08.560* :  that really softens the street that's quite noisy and full of bricks and building at the moment.
*31:08.740- 31:13.340* :  Yeah there's definitely a message there and given that I don't know what it is but I'm
*31:13.340- 31:18.120* :  trying to figure it out and there's some treat in me. There's been speculation that the artist
*31:18.120- 31:23.960* :  could be starting a wider campaign on Monday his website revealed another artwork a goat
*31:23.960- 31:30.020* :  perched on a ledge also in London. James Peak presenter of the Banksy story for BBC Radio
*31:30.360- 31:36.380* :  went along to see that one and he has this assessment. With all Banksy's there's many levels it's
*31:36.380- 31:41.660* :  a lovely piece of art it's far more impressive in the in the flesh than or in the paint I should
*31:41.660- 31:48.880* :  say than on the photos but it looks great. There's a CCTV camera pointing at it that is now
*31:48.880- 31:54.940* :  angled away originally the CCTV camera have been reangled to a look at the goat and with the
*31:54.940- 31:58.600* :  goat being of course the greatest of all time we're hearing a lot about that with the Olympics.
*31:59.220- 32:07.620* :  So is this some sort of clever metaphor for bread and circuses? Are we having our minds taken
*32:07.620- 32:12.320* :  off the stuff that should be capturing our attention? The plight of people in the Middle East
*32:12.320- 32:19.200* :  that goat being an emblem of Palestine and big world problems like that? That's one theory
*32:19.440- 32:24.420* :  another one is that he just loves goats. So what will it be today? I just have prepared to be
*32:24.420- 32:31.260* :  wrong but how exciting if there was an emerging campaign of pieces to be found around London
*32:31.260- 32:37.120* :  over the next few days or weeks? He's got form for that are we looking at another one? James Peak
*32:40.500- 32:45.300* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
