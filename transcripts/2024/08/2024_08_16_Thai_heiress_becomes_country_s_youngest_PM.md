*00:21.120- 00:23.580* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*00:23.900- 00:28.040* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*00:28.040- 00:31.300* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*00:31.580- 00:36.580* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*01:24.140- 01:25.420* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:25.420- 01:29.640* :  We are recording this 13 hours GMC on Friday, the 16th of August.
*01:29.640- 01:32.440* :  Thailand gets its youngest ever Prime Minister.
*01:32.900- 01:37.620* :  The 37-year-old Payton Tarn Chinawatt is the fourth member of her family to get the job.
*01:37.620- 01:43.160* :  A deadly rampage by Israeli settlers in the West Bank leaves a Palestinian man dead.
*01:43.700- 01:46.540* :  Even the Israeli Prime Minister has condemned it.
*01:47.120- 01:51.120* :  And we look at what's being done to prevent the spread of the contagious end-porks virus.
*01:52.660- 01:58.360* :  So in the podcast, these tiny grains prove beyond any doubt that the galvanics are the
*01:58.360- 02:02.460* :  best and most complete record of a critical period in our history.
*02:02.860- 02:06.680* :  The Scottish Islands, which hold the secrets to the Earth's ice age.
*02:11.660- 02:14.500* :  Politics in Thailand is a rough business.
*02:14.500- 02:19.440* :  As well as the possibility of being forced out by a coup, leaders can also be removed
*02:19.440- 02:21.240* :  by the Constitutional Court.
*02:21.240- 02:25.700* :  In fact, it's got rid of four Prime Ministers over the past 16 years.
*02:26.340- 02:29.280* :  The latest just two days ago set out to Weasen.
*02:29.560- 02:33.540* :  He has now been replaced by a member of Thailand's best-known political dynasty.
*02:34.140- 02:38.960* :  Pytong Tarn Chinawatt, daughter of the billionaire tycoon Taxin Chinawatt.
*02:38.960- 02:43.860* :  At the age of 37, she's been chosen as Thailand's youngest ever Prime Minister.
*02:44.460- 02:46.300* :  Now, it's our Payton Tarn Chinawatt,
*02:47.000- 02:52.840* :  Pytong Tarn Chinawatt received more than half the votes of the members of the House of Representatives.
*02:53.000- 02:58.340* :  Therefore, Parliament has approved the motion to nominate Pytong Tarn Chinawatt
*02:58.340- 03:03.680* :  for a point-and-ass Prime Minister in accordance with Section 159 of the Constitution.
*03:04.320- 03:09.200* :  Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Hed in Bangkok told me more about the new leader.
*03:09.500- 03:11.140* :  She's very much a political novice.
*03:11.140- 03:14.920* :  She's the youngest daughter, describes herself as a daddy's girl.
*03:15.780- 03:19.300* :  No one's under any illusions that she'll certainly be listing a lot to her father.
*03:19.860- 03:23.900* :  And, you know, he's still a very dominant figure in her party, Pytong Tarn Chinawatt.
*03:23.900- 03:27.640* :  She worked in the family business up until relatively recently, which is in hotels.
*03:28.320- 03:30.540* :  And only joined the Pytong Tarn Chinawatt party two years ago.
*03:30.980- 03:35.680* :  She was very much the face of Pytong Tarn Chinawatt's campaign last year in the general election
*03:35.680- 03:39.040* :  because she's young and spontaneous and was seen as more appealing.
*03:39.040- 03:42.220* :  But her family clearly did not want her to have the top job.
*03:42.680- 03:46.600* :  There's always a vulnerability in Thailand to being not just losing her job as Prime Minister,
*03:46.600- 03:48.820* :  but also ending up with criminal charges against you.
*03:49.240- 03:53.280* :  But the unexpected move by the courts to oust her predecessor on Wednesday
*03:53.860- 03:55.440* :  gave the party no choice really.
*03:55.780- 04:00.900* :  And the MPs of the party insisted it had to be her because they're already thinking about the next election
*04:00.900- 04:07.360* :  and just her youth and sort of naturalness as a political performer I think they see will be an asset for them.
*04:07.680- 04:14.120* :  And will the courts accept her as leader? They're not too keen on her father or at least they weren't previously?
*04:14.740- 04:20.260* :  No, they're not. And the Chinawatt family faced still quite a lot of opposition in conservative circles
*04:20.260- 04:26.960* :  even though there was a grand bargain last year under which Mr. Texan was able to return from 15 years in exile
*04:27.000- 04:31.440* :  with those conservative forces. They're part of the ruling coalition now to keep out
*04:31.440- 04:35.580* :  the even more reformist radical move forward party, which of course has now been dissolved.
*04:35.580- 04:38.980* :  But it's an uneasy coalition because she's a political novice.
*04:38.980- 04:40.680* :  It's going to be difficult for her to manage that.
*04:41.180- 04:46.680* :  And her party's stock and traders always been about reviving the economy, about making people better off.
*04:47.000- 04:49.560* :  Thailand's economy is really stuck at the moment in low growth.
*04:50.020- 04:53.940* :  And the magic populist policies they tried in the past, they could have run out of those.
*04:54.380- 04:59.980* :  So I think she's going to have a rough ride not only watching over her shoulder in case she commits some kind of infraction
*04:59.980- 05:04.840* :  that brings the courts down with so many other Prime Ministers, but also possibly disappointing
*05:04.840- 05:10.440* :  her supporters by being unable to revive an economy that seems to be stuck in neutral gear.
*05:10.900- 05:17.320* :  Jon Khan heard in Thailand next to a familiar sound in the occupied Palestinian territory of the West Bank.
*05:20.540- 05:26.980* :  Well, that is a funeral for 23 year old Rashid Sadat who was shot dead during an attack by dozens of Israeli settlers
*05:27.640- 05:29.620* :  hurling rocks and throwing Molotov cocktails.
*05:29.620- 05:37.200* :  Another Palestinian villager is reported to be critically injured after the rampage in the Palestinian village of Jit, near Nablus.
*05:37.800- 05:38.820* :  These residents were there.
*05:41.760- 05:45.040* :  There were about 100 settlers who were armed and they were shooting.
*05:45.600- 05:48.720* :  The people in the town came to help when they heard what was going on.
*05:48.760- 05:52.120* :  They saw the gunfire. They were firing live bullets.
*05:57.000- 06:02.360* :  At 6 pm, around 100 settlers attacked. They burnt cars and destroyed homes.
*06:02.900- 06:05.260* :  Some homes were burnt and we put out the fires.
*06:05.840- 06:13.440* :  The army came after two hours. I called them myself. I said, where are you? For two hours they have been attacking us and no one came.
*06:13.440- 06:18.040* :  The firefighters didn't come either. It was like a war launched against us.
*06:18.480- 06:28.300* :  Half a million Israelis live in illegal settlements in the West Bank and Palestinians say extremist settlers have become more violence since the start of the war in Gaza.
*06:28.820- 06:36.360* :  The latest incident though has drawn rare condemnation from the Israeli Prime Minister and even two far-right settlers in his government.
*06:36.360- 06:42.300* :  The EU's top diplomats, as he will propose sanctions against what he called enablers in the Israeli government,
*06:42.800- 06:46.600* :  while the US has also called on Israel to do more to stop such violence.
*06:46.600- 06:52.740* :  The British and French foreign ministers who are visiting Jerusalem also spoke out about the attack.
*06:53.620- 06:58.420* :  So will this tide of criticism prompt tougher action against the settlers from the Israeli authorities?
*06:59.040- 07:01.420* :  I asked our Middle East analyst Sebastien Asher.
*07:01.780- 07:06.720* :  Certainly the Israeli government has been criticized for not doing enough to try to tamp down the violence,
*07:06.720- 07:14.180* :  which is, you say, was already at a high level before October 7th that has certainly got much worse since then.
*07:14.180- 07:25.940* :  A lot of the attacks in the past by the settlers were in response to killings attacks by Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and elsewhere.
*07:26.720- 07:30.960* :  The rampages that they went on when they attacked villages like this.
*07:31.420- 07:35.540* :  I think what has drawn this particular condemnation from the Israeli government.
*07:35.540- 07:43.960* :  Not just from the Prime Minister, but from these two far-right ministers in his cabinet was that there wasn't really any spark like that this time.
*07:44.000- 07:50.860* :  These two far-right ministers who are themselves members of the settler movement, Ben Gavi and Smotrich.
*07:51.240- 07:59.900* :  They both essentially said that this is criminal, what happened, but that the settler cause itself is a justified and a noble one.
*08:00.000- 08:02.800* :  So they're trying to draw a distinction between the two.
*08:03.000- 08:09.940* :  I don't think that necessarily suggests that there's going to be that strong Israeli action in connection with this.
*08:10.040- 08:14.660* :  I mean, it's been promised before. I mean, obviously there'll be an investigation into what's happened.
*08:15.000- 08:15.780* :  There will probably be arrests.
*08:17.960- 08:21.460* :  Quite often those who've been arrested are released quite soon as a lot of pressure.
*08:22.100- 08:27.520* :  Not just from inside the far-right government, but also from outside from their supporters.
*08:28.260- 08:34.260* :  And it's uncomfortable for the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resist that kind of pressure.
*08:34.860- 08:38.500* :  But it certainly is very bad for Israel's public image.
*08:38.500- 08:42.960* :  And we have seen sanctions taken by the US and by European countries
*08:43.560- 08:48.840* :  against some of the most extreme figures in the settler movement over the past few months.
*08:48.860- 08:53.980* :  So there has been more of an international response, whether this will spark that much more.
*08:53.980- 09:00.520* :  I'm not sure, especially in the context of fears that there could be an all-out conflict across the region
*09:00.520- 09:07.740* :  if Iran and Hasbullah respond to Israeli strikes recently, which we're still waiting for.
*09:08.160- 09:14.060* :  And of course, for Gaza ceasefire talks, which resumed yesterday in Qatar are to continue today.
*09:14.600- 09:16.200* :  And I think all eyes are really on this.
*09:16.200- 09:20.920* :  I think from the Israeli perspective, they don't want more bad PR of a government.
*09:20.920- 09:26.080* :  So perhaps their response strongly this time is partly motivated by that.
*09:26.680- 09:32.760* :  But the Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, who tries to rise above politics has made very, very strong comments once again.
*09:32.800- 09:35.720* :  And essentially what they're saying is this is not who we are.
*09:35.760- 09:38.940* :  This is not what Israel represents. We're much better than this.
*09:39.340- 09:41.660* :  Our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Asha.
*09:42.460- 09:49.500* :  The World Health Organization says it expects more cases of MPOX to be detected outside Africa in the coming days.
*09:49.500- 09:54.940* :  As you may have heard in our latest edition, the virus has now been identified in Europe and Asia.
*09:55.320- 10:00.800* :  However, the main vaccine manufacturer says rollouts could be hampered by a lack of orders.
*10:01.400- 10:05.580* :  Bavarian Nordic is one of the only companies with an approved MPOX vaccine.
*10:05.580- 10:11.720* :  It is now seeking European approval to use its vaccine in children aged 12 to 17 years.
*10:12.420- 10:14.280* :  The firm CEO is Paul Chaplin.
*10:14.920- 10:19.460* :  We're going to need to try and make sure that a vaccine supply is sufficient
*10:20.140- 10:24.300* :  and maybe involving other manufacturers to increase capacity.
*10:24.620- 10:29.820* :  Having said all that, the situation in Africa has been evident the whole of this year.
*10:30.060- 10:42.060* :  And the only dose order that we've received is the recent order from Hera, where they ordered 175,000 doses, which we topped up with a 40,000 dose donation.
*10:42.440- 10:48.440* :  So while there's a lot of speculation and a lot of concern, quite frankly, apart from media,
*10:48.880- 10:50.960* :  no one is really contacting us for doses.
*10:51.460- 10:57.880* :  The disease, formerly known as monkeypox, has been declared a global emergency after a surge in cases across Africa.
*10:58.460- 11:03.980* :  The WHO has appealed to wealthy countries not to hoard vaccines and to ramp up production.
*11:04.660- 11:10.560* :  Its spokesman, Tarik Yashavarich, explained what's being done to improve access to preventative treatments.
*11:11.240- 11:17.980* :  Vaccines that exist right now as a preventive tool, we are all looking now that we have this declaration of global health emergency.
*11:17.980- 11:25.980* :  We are hoping to put in place and start mechanisms that already exist to roll out vaccines in countries that are experienced outbreak.
*11:25.980- 11:32.860* :  This will not be mass vaccination. This will be just for targeted groups that are at a high risk of exposure.
*11:33.000- 11:40.000* :  We are now working with the manufacturers and we also looking how we can get those doses into the Democratic Republic of Congo.
*11:40.000- 11:50.200* :  That has seen the biggest outbreak. They have seen 15,000 cases and more than 500 deaths this year, which is much, much larger than what we have seen in previous years.
*11:50.460- 11:52.920* :  So we are really looking for a number of steps to be done.
*11:53.540- 11:56.460* :  Tarik Yashavarich of the World Health Organization
*11:57.600- 12:03.920* :  It was known as Snowball Earth, a big freeze which covered nearly all the globe before animal life emerged.
*12:04.000- 12:14.320* :  Exactly how it came about as long been a mystery, but a small group of Scottish islands may provide a clue to help understanding it as our science correspondent Palab Gosh reports.
*12:17.380- 12:26.560* :  These tiny islands in the inner hebrides of Scotland hold the key to how the first animal life emerged on Earth, hundreds of millions of years ago.
*12:27.560- 12:33.840* :  Each layer of rock face in the Garvalax captures a snapshot of the planet's distant past.
*12:36.820- 12:50.200* :  Scientists have now dated fragments of the rock and shown them to be from the only place in the world to have a detailed record of how our planet plunged into the most severe and prolonged ice age in our history.
*12:50.880- 13:00.560* :  These tiny grains proved beyond any doubt that the Garvalax are the best and most complete record of a critical period in our history called Snowball Earth.
*13:01.060- 13:06.320* :  When, for 18 million years, pretty much the entire planet was covered with ice.
*13:06.800- 13:15.980* :  If we wind back the calendar hundreds of millions of years, we see that Scotland was in a completely different place because the continents have moved over time.
*13:16.000- 13:24.720* :  It was south of the Earth's equator and had a tropical climate until it and the rest of the planet became engulfed in ice.
*13:25.680- 13:28.120* :  But then something remarkable happened.
*13:29.140- 13:35.400* :  After the melting of the Snowball, we suddenly started to get bonafide-y, modern-looking animals.
*13:35.400- 13:45.020* :  It seems counterintuitive that such a big freeze that could have prevented life was actually a spur to generate this explosion of life.
*13:45.200- 13:55.480* :  After the Snowball melted, of course, everything that had adapted to that and diversified in those specialist niches would have had to then compete with each other in some kind of arms raised.
*13:56.180- 14:07.980* :  Geologists have been studying the rocks and the Garvalax for decades, first on foot, and more recently using drones to create detailed computer enhanced images of the rock layers.
*14:11.000- 14:15.340* :  If the results are confirmed, these islands could be awarded a golden spike.
*14:15.960- 14:22.660* :  That's an actual spike hammered in to celebrate the location of a planet-changing geological moment.
*14:23.240- 14:29.180* :  Elias Ruggan imagines what it might be like to receive one of science's greatest accolades.
*14:29.640- 14:33.200* :  It would be fantastic. Golden spikes around the world are reasonably big deals.
*14:33.200- 14:37.800* :  The previous one that was ratified was from 30 years ago, so it doesn't happen that often.
*14:38.060- 14:47.620* :  Do you think you'll get it? I'm hoping so. It's definitely the leading candidate. I don't think there's many other layers of rock and sections around the world that come close, so I'm quite confident yet.
*14:48.240- 15:01.920* :  Researchers will find out next year whether they and Scotland have won the golden spike, but in the meantime they press on with their research, studying the rocks that hold the key to the emergence of the first complex life on Earth.
*15:03.200- 15:04.940* :  That report by Palab Gosh.
*15:07.120- 15:08.900* :  Still to come on the global news podcast.
*15:09.740- 15:15.820* :  We won the EPL the last time in 2004. It was quite joyous, and we are looking at winning this season.
*15:16.060- 15:19.700* :  We have that energy of winning, and this is our winning here.
*15:20.000- 15:26.780* :  While these football fans in Kenya will be rooting for Arsenal in the upcoming English Premier League.
*15:35.120- 15:38.300* :  This season, Instacart has your back to school.
*15:38.980- 15:43.680* :  As in, they've got your back to school lunch favorites like snack packs and fresh fruit.

*15:56.980- 15:59.160* :  Let's face it, we were all that kid.
*15:59.840- 16:09.340* :  So first, call your parents to say I'm sorry, and then download the Instacart app to get delivery in as fast as 30 minutes all school year long.

*16:52.280- 17:01.520* :  Ukraine says its cross-border incursion into the Russian region of Kursk is necessary to persuade Russia to engage in fair negotiations over its invasion of Ukraine.
*17:01.520- 17:11.800* :  The Ukrainian military said on Thursday it now controls dozens of settlements, and had set up a military command office in the town of Suja, about 10 kilometers inside Russia.
*17:12.340- 17:21.540* :  The attack, the biggest by a foreign army on Russia since the Second World War, has boosted morale in Ukraine and revealed weaknesses in Russia's defenses.
*17:22.380- 17:27.120* :  But what's been the reaction in Moscow? Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg, has been finding out.
*17:30.300- 17:37.880* :  Here in the center of Moscow, I can see commuters rushing to a metro station, and there are people whizzing by on electric scooters.
*17:38.600- 17:43.820* :  It never fails to amaze me how normal everything looks on the surface here.
*17:44.480- 17:52.320* :  When in reality there is nothing normal about what has been happening in Russia for the last two and a half years, so many dramatic events.
*17:53.080- 18:00.500* :  From Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine to the Wagner Mutiny, those armed mercenaries marching on Moscow last year.
*18:01.040- 18:06.980* :  And now, Ukrainian soldiers are inside Russia, seizing territory in Kursk region.
*18:08.400- 18:13.700* :  For many people in the Russian capital, the war suddenly feels much closer.
*18:16.000- 18:23.340* :  The incursion took me completely by surprise, Alessia tells me, I'm tired and I'm worried.
*18:27.080- 18:33.920* :  It makes me sad, says Laura, it shows that our borders are unprotected, then I speak to Sophia.
*18:34.240- 18:40.120* :  I think it's horrible, and everything is happening now, it is all Russian responsibility.
*18:40.120- 18:46.860* :  I think that in every war, a responsibility is on those sides who started.
*18:47.640- 18:53.200* :  You said that it's Russia's responsibility. Do many people think this?
*18:53.480- 18:56.380* :  No, no, me and some of my friends.
*18:57.000- 18:59.700* :  Why do you think most people don't see that?
*18:59.980- 19:07.020* :  Because propaganda in Russia is very, very weak, and not everyone has critical thinking.
*19:07.720- 19:08.960* :  What do you think is going to happen?
*19:09.940- 19:15.840* :  Now I'm worried about third world war, but I hope it's just my worry.
*19:17.980- 19:18.440* :  That's all.
*19:19.660- 19:22.520* :  Vladimir Telspi, he's been fighting in Ukraine.
*19:23.760- 19:27.200* :  Eventually, Putin and Zelensky will make peace, he says.
*19:27.200- 19:33.320* :  But right now, this is no special military operation, it's a terrifying war.
*19:41.940- 19:48.260* :  The evening news on Russian TV shows Russian troops in Kursk region trying to restore control.
*19:52.380- 19:59.240* :  There is extensive TV coverage here of the Ukrainian incursion, but from a heavily pro-Russia perspective.
*19:59.340- 20:04.520* :  We'll be victorious, one soldier says.
*20:05.180- 20:08.160* :  I'm 100% sure we'll win, says another.
*20:09.240- 20:15.400* :  Then the reporter reveals that the soldiers have an autographed photo of Vladimir Putin with them.
*20:15.820- 20:19.260* :  The president's portrait also features on their banner.
*20:19.920- 20:24.040* :  There's a clear message here. Putin will lead Russia to victory.
*20:24.760- 20:26.640* :  But what exactly is victory?
*20:27.540- 20:32.480* :  Two and a half years ago, the plan seemed to be the total subjugation of Ukraine.
*20:32.480- 20:37.000* :  But right now, Russia is struggling to secure its own border.
*20:41.840- 20:47.960* :  A few days ago, in stark contrast to the typically triumphalist messages on Russian state television,
*20:48.640- 20:51.900* :  there was a rare public moment of self-doubt.
*20:52.540- 20:58.820* :  On a political talk show, a Russian film director suggested that his country might lose the war.
*20:59.860- 21:04.140* :  We must stop saying that everything in our country is fine, he said.
*21:04.740- 21:06.440* :  It isn't. He went on.
*21:07.120- 21:11.220* :  Our TV has been telling us that Ukrainian soldiers don't want to fight.
*21:12.200- 21:16.020* :  But now we see, they're fighting well, they're highly motivated.
*21:16.980- 21:18.140* :  Why are we kidding ourselves?
*21:18.480- 21:19.040* :  Why do we want to fight?
*21:22.040- 21:29.160* :  The longer Ukraine's incursion into Russia continues, the more likely we are to hear that question again.
*21:29.820- 21:31.760* :  Our Russian editor, Steve Rosenberg.
*21:32.580- 21:38.320* :  Hundreds of flights have been grounded in Japan as Typhoon Ampel moves towards the Tokyo region.
*21:38.320- 21:45.080* :  The storm, classified as the second strongest, is situated off the Pacific coast of the Japanese main island.
*21:45.080- 21:48.860* :  Our Asia-Pacific regional editor, Klitsia Sala, has the details.
*21:49.560- 21:56.540* :  Hundreds of thousands of Japanese travelers were hoping to make their way home at the end of the Obon holiday.
*21:57.060- 22:02.560* :  One of Japan's three major holiday seasons. Typhoon Ampel disrupted their plans.
*22:02.560- 22:10.020* :  The busy high-speed shinkansen bullet train service between Tokyo and Nagoya has been suspended for the day.
*22:10.660- 22:21.080* :  Japan Airlines and Olippon Airways have cancelled over 600 flights to and from Tokyo, affecting about 120,000 passengers.
*22:21.720- 22:29.420* :  Typhoon Ampel is now forecast to head towards the eastern region of Kanto, skirting past the Japanese capital Tokyo.
*22:30.240- 22:34.940* :  Nearly 10,000 residents were told to leave their homes in areas close to the city.
*22:35.540- 22:42.720* :  The typhoon is expected to bring heavy rain to the region and to pack winds of over 160 km an hour.
*22:43.220- 22:53.140* :  The Japan Meteorological Agency says the winds will be strong enough to overturn a moving truck and has warned residents to take precautions against flying objects.
*22:54.040- 23:00.060* :  The agency has classified the storm as very strong, one of two higher categories of typhoons.
*23:00.640- 23:07.540* :  Authorities urged people to stay indoors and warned of the possibility of mudslides, high waves and flooding.
*23:08.020- 23:09.000* :  Clizia Salah.
*23:09.340- 23:17.200* :  The British government is promising that victims of a historic infected blood scandal will get their first compensation payments by the end of the year.
*23:17.780- 23:28.180* :  More than 30,000 people across Britain contracted HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products mainly in the 1970s and 80s.
*23:28.720- 23:33.480* :  Melanie Richmond contracted hepatitis C when she was treated with blood products in 1989.
*23:33.480- 23:40.480* :  She said the announcement of the compensation was a huge relief as she explained how she has been affected.
*23:41.160- 23:52.620* :  I've started jobs and they've lasted maybe one or two weeks and then I've had to quit because of chronic fatigue or hemorrhage in which is related to the blood disorder.
*23:53.520- 23:55.420* :  There's been a huge, huge impact.
*23:56.160- 24:03.540* :  We will be in silence to ignore it and it's only really been the last year where we're being recognized.
*24:04.360- 24:08.620* :  Some survivors are set to get up to $3 million in lifelong support.
*24:09.400- 24:20.360* :  An extra 15,000 pounds or 19,000 US dollars will be paid to a group of former pupils at a school where children were unwittingly given contaminated products as part of medical research.
*24:21.080- 24:23.660* :  Some of those victims have described that payout as insulting.
*24:23.660- 24:28.920* :  The government has defended its plans, saying it is giving comprehensive compensation to victims.
*24:29.420- 24:30.840* :  Here's Minister Nick Thomas Simmons.
*24:31.420- 24:43.420* :  Within the scheme there are obviously awards for the illnesses themselves where there are particular tariff intervals for people and reflecting the impact of the different conditions.
*24:43.460- 24:48.520* :  There are awards for the social impact where people suffer sometimes appalling stigma and isolation.
*24:48.520- 24:55.980* :  There are awards for what is described in the scheme as lack of autonomy, which are things like the effect on your private and family life.
*24:55.980- 25:01.760* :  There are care awards, there are also awards for loss of earnings in the past and the future.
*25:02.280- 25:05.240* :  So that is a comprehensive package.
*25:05.240- 25:22.840* :  And if you look at some of the intervals, for example, for HIV, which started over 2 million pounds, that's what we really want people to understand that the 15,000 pounds is a small part of the comprehensive compensation package that's being put forward.
*25:23.300- 25:24.920* :  Minister Nick Thomas Simmons.
*25:25.820- 25:31.740* :  As the new season of the English Premier League kicks off, who will football fans in Africa be rooting for?
*25:32.120- 25:34.200* :  The most popular teams is Arsenal.
*25:34.880- 25:39.920* :  In Kenya, one Arsenal supporters club is even holding church prayers ahead of crucial games.
*25:40.660- 25:45.000* :  The fan club there has grown hugely since its inception in Nairobi 14 years ago.
*25:45.000- 25:47.780* :  It's even been acknowledged by Arsenal FC here.
*25:48.220- 25:52.520* :  Kelvin Kimathi of BBC Sport Africa has been to meet some of the founding members.
*25:53.000- 26:00.460* :  Arsenal enjoys passionate support from its supporters the world over.
*26:00.840- 26:05.860* :  But here in Bungomal town in Western Kenya, this fan club is taking it to a whole new level.
*26:06.000- 26:16.220* :  Founded in Kenya's Capitonei Robe in 2010, the supporters club is a place for Ghana's fans to celebrate and sometimes commiserate their team.
*26:16.700- 26:20.420* :  Their 18 branches can't be wide with over 4,000 registered members.
*26:20.840- 26:26.400* :  I started supporting Arsenal. That was back in 2006 and I was in high school at that time.
*26:26.620- 26:29.780* :  The only thing that I came to learn was about theory andry.
*26:30.080- 26:32.760* :  And that's when I came and said I want to be Arsenal fan.
*26:33.060- 26:39.080* :  I support Arsenal because ever since I knew Arsenal or joined Arsenal, it has been recruiting Africans.
*26:39.080- 26:42.060* :  We have seen talents being nurtured at the Emirates.
*26:42.600- 26:47.620* :  Bukai Osaka is one of Africa English player and he's also my African best player.
*26:49.380- 26:52.140* :  Emmanuel and Irene are among the dedicated Arsenal candidates.
*26:52.940- 27:01.520* :  Such is their devotion to their club, the supporters even hold annual inter-denominant prayers, hoping for divine intervention to get their beloved Arsenal to victory.
*27:04.000- 27:09.540* :  We always go to the prayers and maybe one of these fine days is going to answer us and we are going to get a cover.
*27:09.780- 27:15.180* :  We always pray for our team, we pray for our fans, we pray for our families and we pray for our country also.
*27:15.420- 27:18.440* :  And the African fan base, so that we also have success.
*27:18.900- 27:22.920* :  You've seen the previous few seasons, we are progressing, we trust the process.
*27:23.300- 27:25.600* :  So, when did this fun club start?
*27:26.140- 27:32.940* :  Dennis Jav, the club chairman, was instrumental in its creation while still a university student in Nairobi in 2010.
*27:33.480- 27:40.040* :  I realized it was listed among the most popular brands and when you look at the fan base, without even struggling, Arsenal has got the majority of fans.
*27:41.800- 27:52.700* :  The devotion of Arsenal can a fans extend into the local community with charitable activities from food and clothes distribution to organizing tournaments, trip planting and blood donation events.
*27:52.880- 28:01.360* :  There are watch parties and there is the Arsenal supporters of Africa festival, an annual cultural event for Ghana's fans across the continent.
*28:01.360- 28:09.380* :  Arsenal has recognized the supporters club by hanging their banner and a morale of the fans at the Emirates, the club's home stadium.
*28:09.820- 28:14.660* :  Singapore, Ghana, Arsenal, Kenya, Hakuna, Matata in Emirates means a lot to us.
*28:14.860- 28:17.260* :  Arsenal recognized us, so we feel good.
*28:17.500- 28:24.340* :  And the African links continue. Arsenal have released their way kit for their new season, which features an African inspired design.
*28:24.760- 28:37.200* :  We look at the new kit this season, it has African colours, it blends, the African colours across the continent and as an African fan, it gives me a sense of identity and belonging to that team.
*28:37.360- 28:41.480* :  As a Kenya and I feel those are our colours, with red, green and black.
*28:41.660- 28:46.600* :  With the new Premier League season about to kick off, these fans remain committed to their team.
*28:46.800- 28:50.060* :  This is our season and we are going to have a cup.
*28:50.120- 28:56.320* :  We won the EPL the last time in 2004, it was quite joyous and we are looking at winning this season.
*28:56.520- 29:00.180* :  We have that energy of winning and this is our winning here.
*29:04.040- 29:07.840* :  Our report from Kenya by Kelvin Kimathi of BBC Sport Africa.
*29:08.520- 29:13.940* :  Now have you ever realised you've been using a well-known phrase for ages but actually getting it wrong?
*29:14.000- 29:22.840* :  Perhaps you have referred to a damp squid instead of the correct term damp squib or talked about the best things since life's bread.
*29:23.560- 29:31.680* :  If so, you're not alone. A list of the top 10 misheard sayings in the English language has now been published and Richard Hamilton has been looking at it.
*29:32.140- 29:42.760* :  A study of 2,000 adults in the UK found that 40% of them had been mishearing common sayings for years around a tenth of their entire lives.
*29:43.440- 29:55.880* :  The list of the 10 most misheard phrases has now been revealed and the top ones are Riggle Room instead of Wiggle Room, followed by Escape Goat when it should be Escape Goat.
*29:56.460- 30:02.060* :  Nip it in the butt in place of bud and tender hooks rather than tender hooks.
*30:02.980- 30:12.440* :  The reason why people get these words wrong is that they're often archaic terms which are no longer in use but sound similar to current words.
*30:12.440- 30:23.060* :  So for example a tender hook was a nail dating back to the 14th century to stretch wool on a wooden frame called a tender.
*30:23.820- 30:35.860* :  A squib is an old name for a firework and in the Bible Escape Goat is one of a pair of kid goats that's released into the wilderness while the other is sacrificed.
*30:36.960- 30:45.320* :  But does it really matter if we get these phrases wrong? Dr Laura Bailey is an expert on linguistics at the University of Kent.
*30:45.960- 30:52.840* :  It's not really the end of the world if you get something wrong, you're still using a phrase to mean the thing that you mean it to me.
*30:53.340- 30:58.800* :  Sometimes I suppose a bit sad if you lose the original meaning of it by changing it.
*30:59.260- 31:03.980* :  So you might lose a historical story behind the phrases meaning.
*31:04.860- 31:06.920* :  It might matter because it might make you a bit duffed.
*31:07.380- 31:11.980* :  So it might matter in terms of what other people think of you and make judgments about you.
*31:11.980- 31:18.260* :  But sometimes I think it would be sad to lose the phrases or the actual meaning of the phrase itself.
*31:18.780- 31:31.800* :  In the list are words that sound the same, homophones, but differ in spelling meaning and origin, such as moot point written with a U instead of moot with two O's.
*31:32.240- 31:35.780* :  A moot by the way is an old English name for a judicial court.
*31:36.800- 31:42.100* :  Misheard words or phrases are known as malapropisms or eggcorns.
*31:42.100- 31:52.380* :  Interestingly, or maybe confusingly, the word eggcorn is itself an eggcorn, as it's derived from the more common word, eggcorn.
*31:53.260- 31:56.360* :  Richard Hamilton, the best reporter since sliced bread.
*31:58.540- 32:02.800* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*32:02.800- 32:06.700* :  This edition was mixed by Ricardo McCarthy and produced by Stephanie Zacherson.
*32:06.900- 32:08.980* :  Our editors, Karen Martin, I'm Oliver Conway.
*32:09.420- 32:10.440* :  Until next time, goodbye.
