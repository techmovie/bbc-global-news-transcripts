*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?

*01:07.320- 01:10.820* :  I'm Nick Miles and I'm at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 14th of August.
*01:10.820- 01:12.060* :  These are our main stories.
*01:12.420- 01:15.660* :  A new round of political uncertainty has begun in Thailand.
*01:16.200- 01:19.600* :  After a court removed the Prime Minister from office, so what comes next?
*01:20.140- 01:22.740* :  Talks to end Sudan's silver war are underway,
*01:22.740- 01:25.800* :  amid more warnings that the health system is breaking down.
*01:26.460- 01:30.880* :  And an investigation into the state run funeral industry in China reveals corruption,
*01:31.060- 01:33.320* :  including the theft and sale of corpses.
*01:35.880- 01:39.100* :  Also in this podcast, people don't park them properly.
*01:39.100- 01:40.080* :  They're tipped over.
*01:40.080- 01:42.160* :  They're scattered around the city like in Fiddylough.
*01:42.160- 01:44.140* :  Rubbish and creating tripping hazards.
*01:44.140- 01:45.560* :  It's a real real problem.
*01:45.560- 01:51.040* :  The Australian city of Melbourne becomes the latest place to ban e-scooters from its streets.
*01:51.500- 01:55.580* :  And we hear from the Olympic runner who finished a marathon despite breaking her lake.
*01:59.240- 02:02.260* :  Thailand is no stranger to political upheaval.
*02:02.260- 02:06.600* :  There have been coups, military governments and violent demonstrations in recent years.
*02:07.060- 02:11.360* :  Now the country has been thrown into more uncertainty after the constitutional court
*02:11.360- 02:14.580* :  dismissed the Prime Minister, Satā Tāvisin.
*02:15.300- 02:17.460* :  He said he'd abide by the court's decision.
*02:17.960- 02:22.280* :  I respect the verdict of the constitutional court.
*02:22.940- 02:25.940* :  I reiterate that for almost one year I've been in this role,
*02:25.940- 02:29.320* :  I've tried with good intentions to lead the country with honesty.
*02:31.220- 02:34.420* :  The judge said Mr Satā had breached the ethical rules
*02:34.420- 02:39.040* :  by appointing to his cabinet a former lawyer who'd served time in jail.
*02:39.400- 02:41.380* :  Jonathan Head is our correspondent in Bangkok.
*02:42.040- 02:43.340* :  What's his assessment of the ruling?
*02:43.820- 02:48.540* :  Once again, Thailand's courts are being used to settle the political direction of the country
*02:49.140- 02:50.340* :  rather than elections.
*02:50.340- 02:53.720* :  I mean, for the POTI voters, they only voted just over a year ago.
*02:53.720- 02:58.140* :  And at that stage, there was a huge wave of support for the reformist move forward party.
*02:58.560- 03:02.480* :  That party was not allowed to form a government by an unelected institution as Senate.
*03:02.900- 03:06.360* :  Then it was dissolved completely last week by the constitutional court.
*03:06.360- 03:08.840* :  The constitutional court has dissolved numerous parties.
*03:08.840- 03:12.220* :  The government that did form was patched together coalition
*03:12.220- 03:14.700* :  by the second-ranking party POTI.
*03:15.080- 03:18.040* :  Their Prime Minister, Designat Shreta Tawis and their businessmen,
*03:18.340- 03:19.960* :  has now been felt by the same court.
*03:19.960- 03:22.200* :  It shows that in Thailand it's the courts that decide
*03:22.220- 03:24.920* :  and not the people. I think many ties will conclude that.
*03:25.480- 03:28.300* :  Behind it, though, is a slightly more murky picture,
*03:28.300- 03:30.580* :  which is that said it was always a place man.
*03:30.580- 03:33.280* :  He's a front man, really, for tax in Chinawatt.
*03:33.660- 03:36.760* :  The charismatic, once exiled former Prime Minister,
*03:37.180- 03:40.100* :  who has been at the heart of Thailand's conflict for years and years
*03:40.220- 03:43.680* :  and was allowed to come back from exile and avoid going to prison
*03:44.240- 03:46.360* :  in what was seen as a grand bargain last year.
*03:46.360- 03:48.920* :  And he chose Setta Tawis and to be his man.
*03:49.240- 03:52.260* :  We assume we don't know for sure that Setta is downfall.
*03:52.260- 03:56.660* :  I mean, nobody takes the idea of enforcing ethics seriously and typolitics.
*03:56.660- 03:57.920* :  It's a very unethical business.
*03:58.400- 04:01.220* :  We assume that Mr. Taxin probably has something to do with that.
*04:01.480- 04:05.720* :  We will know, once we see Parliament sit and a new Prime Minister get formed.
*04:05.720- 04:08.000* :  And we're not sure whether there's some kind of new arrangement
*04:08.000- 04:09.320* :  in the coalition going on.
*04:09.800- 04:12.160* :  This is the result of backroom politicking and sadly,
*04:12.160- 04:14.280* :  Mr. Setta, who's had less than a year in office,
*04:14.660- 04:16.300* :  has had very little chance to make his mark.
*04:16.440- 04:18.980* :  So hugely complex background to all this,
*04:18.980- 04:21.800* :  but ordinary ties must be craving stability.
*04:22.240- 04:25.520* :  They are, and they're craving a government that can do something
*04:25.520- 04:28.000* :  to revive what is, in effect, a sick man economy.
*04:28.400- 04:31.780* :  In Thailand, was famous for its breakneck economic growth for decades
*04:32.340- 04:34.360* :  up until 2010 or so.
*04:34.700- 04:36.460* :  But for the last 15 years or so,
*04:36.780- 04:38.540* :  the economy is just slowed down and slowed down.
*04:38.540- 04:39.920* :  And everyone wants to see growth back.
*04:39.920- 04:41.980* :  Mr. Setta was trying to do that,
*04:42.460- 04:43.680* :  although they're not having a lot of success,
*04:43.680- 04:46.720* :  I've no doubt that whatever new government will come into office
*04:46.720- 04:47.700* :  will try the same thing.
*04:47.700- 04:49.960* :  But you've only got three years now till the next election.
*04:50.520- 04:53.840* :  And I think this will tell a lot of ties that it is the interference
*04:53.920- 04:56.140* :  of these powerful, unelected institutions,
*04:56.140- 04:58.800* :  the courts that can be used for political reasons
*04:59.320- 05:01.740* :  and the fragmented nature of typolitics right now,
*05:02.100- 05:04.240* :  which makes it almost impossible to form a government
*05:04.240- 05:05.840* :  that gives them hope of a new beginning.
*05:06.560- 05:07.080* :  Jonathan Head.
*05:07.800- 05:11.460* :  It is nearly 60 years since Israel found itself fighting a conflict
*05:11.460- 05:12.820* :  on multiple fronts.
*05:12.840- 05:16.780* :  The so-called Six-Day War ended to many people's surprise
*05:16.780- 05:18.100* :  with an Israeli victory.
*05:18.580- 05:21.580* :  But could the country be about to find itself in a similar situation?
*05:22.100- 05:26.140* :  Many expect Iran to retaliate for the assassination of a Hamas leader
*05:26.500- 05:27.800* :  whilst he was visiting the country.
*05:28.140- 05:30.640* :  And his baller forces in Lebanon are seaving
*05:30.640- 05:32.580* :  at the killing of one of their senior figures
*05:33.080- 05:34.860* :  in a similarly targeted strike.
*05:34.860- 05:37.760* :  Plus, of course, there's the continued fighting in Gaza
*05:37.860- 05:42.460* :  where it seems a milestone will soon be reached 40,000 Palestinians dead.
*05:43.060- 05:46.100* :  A reporter Lucy Williamson has the story of how one family
*05:46.100- 05:48.100* :  was affected by an airstrike this week.
*05:51.200- 05:54.900* :  For four days, Muhammad Abu Khamsan was a father.
*05:56.040- 05:58.000* :  This day will haunt him forever.
*05:59.300- 06:01.180* :  The day he left his newborn twins,
*06:02.140- 06:04.680* :  Asyl and Asa, at home with their mother,
*06:05.460- 06:07.320* :  while he went to collect their birth certificates
*06:08.500- 06:11.380* :  and returned to find them killed in a strike
*06:11.380- 06:13.200* :  on their building in Derrabala.
*06:15.500- 06:17.040* :  Today, he prepared to bury them.
*06:18.620- 06:21.800* :  A new parent comforted like a child.
*06:23.840- 06:26.260* :  I didn't even have time to celebrate them, he said.
*06:27.800- 06:31.080* :  Gaza's health ministry says a 115 infants,
*06:31.700- 06:36.540* :  including Asyl and Asa, have been born and killed during this war.
*06:39.880- 06:43.460* :  We ask the Israeli army why the twins' family home was bombed
*06:43.900- 06:45.060* :  and are waiting for a response.
*06:47.100- 06:49.220* :  Fighting has continued across the Gaza Strip
*06:49.220- 06:52.560* :  with both Israel and Hamas under fresh pressure
*06:52.920- 06:56.880* :  to agree a ceasefire deal to calm spiraling regional threats.
*06:58.500- 07:00.900* :  Today, Hamas released video which it said
*07:00.900- 07:04.680* :  showed rockets being launched from Gaza towards Tel Aviv.
*07:05.020- 07:08.860* :  Israel's army said one had crossed into Israeli territory
*07:10.040- 07:11.100* :  and fallen into the sea.
*07:13.020- 07:14.700* :  In the southern city of Han Unis,
*07:15.040- 07:17.520* :  displaced residents not long returned,
*07:17.900- 07:19.700* :  fled artillery and airstrikes again.
*07:22.020- 07:23.580* :  Who will breastfeed this baby,
*07:23.580- 07:26.200* :  one resident cried over the ruins of a building?
*07:26.880- 07:29.280* :  All her family were killed, even her mother.
*07:31.040- 07:33.220* :  Reem Abu Hayah, three months old,
*07:33.540- 07:36.780* :  was pulled from the rubble, bruised and battered.
*07:37.240- 07:39.280* :  The only survivor of an airstrike
*07:39.280- 07:41.680* :  that her grandmother says killed her parents
*07:41.700- 07:44.480* :  and eight siblings, along with 10 other people.
*07:46.320- 07:49.940* :  They are the terrorists, the ones that kill children.
*07:50.880- 07:54.700* :  They are supported by America, out of 20 people.
*07:55.180- 07:57.480* :  This one is the only one left.
*07:58.420- 08:00.520* :  The focus on Gaza now is shrinking
*08:00.580- 08:03.500* :  as the threat of regional conflict grows.
*08:04.540- 08:06.660* :  But each child left without a family,
*08:07.160- 08:09.380* :  each father left without his children
*08:10.180- 08:12.500* :  is adding to the long shadow of this war.
*08:13.060- 08:16.300* :  Lucy Williamson, a massive scandal has emerged
*08:16.300- 08:19.100* :  in China's state-run funeral industry.
*08:19.520- 08:22.020* :  Investigators there have discovered widespread corruption,
*08:22.020- 08:24.700* :  including the theft and resell of corpses.
*08:25.440- 08:27.680* :  Our China media analyst, Carrie Allen,
*08:27.680- 08:29.860* :  told us what more we know about the allegations.
*08:30.400- 08:33.380* :  This all started really with a Chinese biomedical company
*08:33.380- 08:36.500* :  that was accused last week of stealing more than 4,000 bodies
*08:36.500- 08:38.660* :  from crematoriums and medical laboratories
*08:39.240- 08:40.480* :  in a northern Chinese province
*08:40.480- 08:42.520* :  to use bones for dental grafts.
*08:42.840- 08:45.040* :  And what I'm seeing today is that Chinese media
*08:45.040- 08:46.740* :  are basically signaling that the government
*08:46.740- 08:49.260* :  is now looking to carry out a nationwide crackdown
*08:49.260- 08:50.460* :  to the funeral industry.
*08:50.820- 08:53.660* :  What's important to know is that most of China's funeral parlors
*08:53.660- 08:55.140* :  are managed under the direct supervision
*08:55.220- 08:56.580* :  of civil affairs authorities.
*08:56.580- 08:58.020* :  So we're talking local officials
*08:58.580- 09:00.420* :  and reports are saying today that at least eight
*09:00.420- 09:03.800* :  of these regions across China have reported investigations
*09:03.960- 09:05.940* :  into people connected to funeral homes
*09:05.940- 09:07.740* :  and funeral management institutions.
*09:08.380- 09:11.400* :  So it does look like it's going to be a real crackdown
*09:11.400- 09:14.040* :  into both small scale and large offences
*09:14.060- 09:15.600* :  but very much targeting corruption.
*09:16.120- 09:19.360* :  And those allegations are of the theft and resell of corpses.
*09:19.800- 09:23.120* :  I imagine many people in China are deeply shocked by that.
*09:23.400- 09:25.260* :  They are, yes, but what's very evident today
*09:25.260- 09:27.500* :  is that on social media platforms like Waibo,
*09:27.980- 09:29.560* :  if you read any report on this,
*09:29.880- 09:32.040* :  you'll see that there are zero comments
*09:32.180- 09:34.100* :  and I suspect that social media platforms
*09:34.100- 09:35.800* :  are playing a role in stopping people
*09:35.800- 09:37.120* :  from talking about this.
*09:37.500- 09:39.000* :  But there are so many reports on it
*09:39.000- 09:41.120* :  talking about how this one popular outlet,
*09:41.120- 09:43.720* :  the paper said that the authorities were investigating
*09:43.720- 09:46.540* :  a crime ring that was stealing and reselling corpses
*09:46.540- 09:47.260* :  for profits.
*09:47.840- 09:49.320* :  They were buying them and using them
*09:49.320- 09:50.800* :  to produce these bone grafts.
*09:51.060- 09:53.280* :  And we have to factor in in China that funerals
*09:53.340- 09:54.620* :  and associated services.
*09:54.620- 09:56.900* :  They're big money-making businesses in China.
*09:56.900- 09:58.340* :  It's got a huge population.
*09:58.760- 10:02.080* :  In fact, in 2020, about $36 billion US dollars
*10:02.080- 10:03.280* :  was spent on the industry.
*10:03.920- 10:04.440* :  Kerry Allen.
*10:04.980- 10:08.200* :  The governor of Russia's border region of Belgorod
*10:08.340- 10:10.680* :  has declared a state of emergency saying
*10:10.680- 10:12.960* :  that Ukrainian shelling had made the situation
*10:12.960- 10:14.320* :  they're extremely difficult.
*10:14.700- 10:16.420* :  Ukrainian troops have also been advancing
*10:16.460- 10:18.820* :  in the neighboring Kursk region of Russia,
*10:19.200- 10:21.180* :  following that surprise incursion there
*10:21.180- 10:22.960* :  that started eight days ago.
*10:23.460- 10:26.960* :  Kiev says it now controls more than 1,000 square kilometers
*10:26.960- 10:27.980* :  of Russian territory.
*10:28.520- 10:29.840* :  But the Defense Ministry in Moscow
*10:29.840- 10:32.160* :  insists its forces have repelled attempts
*10:32.160- 10:35.700* :  by Ukrainian mobile units to push deeper into Russia.
*10:36.220- 10:37.920* :  Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner,
*10:37.920- 10:39.820* :  gave us his assessment of the situation.
*10:40.540- 10:42.080* :  I think this is surprised a lot of people
*10:42.080- 10:43.460* :  because this is very different
*10:43.520- 10:45.000* :  from the previous kind of shooting
*10:45.000- 10:47.680* :  and scoot, little operations that Ukraine intelligence
*10:47.680- 10:51.300* :  has mounted using pro-Ukrainian Russian mercenaries,
*10:51.300- 10:54.640* :  essentially, volunteers, rebels, traitors in Russia's eyes,
*10:55.080- 10:56.980* :  who went across the border, planted a flag,
*10:56.980- 10:59.220* :  took some selfies and cleared off back across the border.
*10:59.700- 11:00.300* :  This is different.
*11:00.860- 11:03.780* :  This is a light division-sized force of around 10,
*11:03.820- 11:06.940* :  maybe as much as 12,000 troops, backed by tanks,
*11:07.240- 11:09.580* :  artillery, signals, electronic warfare,
*11:09.580- 11:11.920* :  air defense, in other words, the full palerplay
*11:11.920- 11:13.760* :  of modern warfare, using what's known as
*11:13.760- 11:16.360* :  Combined Arms Warfare, which has overwhelmed
*11:17.040- 11:18.400* :  the poor Russian defenses.
*11:18.400- 11:20.880* :  They spotted a weak link in Russia's front line there
*11:20.880- 11:23.180* :  or the international border and exploited it.
*11:23.400- 11:26.360* :  The dilemma now is not for President Putin.
*11:26.620- 11:27.380* :  There's no choice for him.
*11:27.380- 11:28.260* :  He just wants them out.
*11:28.380- 11:30.600* :  The dilemma is actually for President Zelensky
*11:30.820- 11:33.080* :  as to whether he stays put or gets out.
*11:33.080- 11:35.380* :  And there are risks and rewards on both sides.
*11:35.800- 11:36.680* :  Why has he done this?
*11:36.860- 11:38.840* :  Well, partly to bring the war home to Russians,
*11:39.480- 11:42.140* :  partly in the hopes of relieving some of the pressure
*11:42.140- 11:45.180* :  on the Donbass where Russian forces are slowly advancing,
*11:45.180- 11:48.120* :  pushing back the Ukrainians, that so far hasn't worked.
*11:48.120- 11:51.560* :  But also, it's a massive psychological boost for Ukrainians
*11:51.560- 11:54.560* :  who all summer have been fed a diet of depressing news
*11:54.560- 11:56.400* :  coupled with drone and missile strikes.
*11:56.920- 11:58.660* :  This has given them a course to celebrate.
*11:58.960- 12:00.100* :  But let's put this in perspective.
*12:00.100- 12:03.100* :  The area that they have taken is minuscule
*12:03.440- 12:05.200* :  compared to the areas of Ukraine
*12:05.200- 12:06.860* :  that Russia still occupies.
*12:07.180- 12:09.320* :  Frank Gardner, and if you'd like to hear more about
*12:09.320- 12:12.380* :  the ramifications of Ukraine's offensive inside Russia,
*12:12.840- 12:15.640* :  you can listen to the latest episode of The Global Story.
*12:15.640- 12:17.580* :  You can find it wherever you get your podcasts.
*12:18.760- 12:20.980* :  When they first appeared on the streets around the world,
*12:20.980- 12:24.120* :  about 10 years ago, e-scooters were largely welcomed
*12:24.120- 12:26.040* :  as a green way of getting around.
*12:26.780- 12:29.940* :  But a string of fatal accidents involving the vehicles
*12:29.940- 12:31.300* :  has changed attitudes.
*12:31.840- 12:34.260* :  Melbourne in Australia has just become the latest city
*12:34.260- 12:37.040* :  to ban e-scooters entirely because officials say
*12:37.040- 12:39.100* :  they pose unacceptable safety risks.
*12:39.140- 12:43.860* :  Victoria Owenkonda spoke to our Australia correspondent, Katie Watson.
*12:44.400- 12:48.380* :  On Tuesday evening, city councillors voted six to four
*12:48.380- 12:50.500* :  to ban e-scooters almost immediately.
*12:50.520- 12:53.680* :  So that means all the operators have to remove the scooters
*12:53.820- 12:55.140* :  within 30 days.
*12:55.600- 13:00.360* :  Speaking on local radio, three AW mayor Nicholas Reese explained.
*13:01.020- 13:02.880* :  People don't park them properly.
*13:02.880- 13:03.860* :  They're tipped over.
*13:03.860- 13:05.940* :  They're scattered around the city like in Petylite.
*13:05.940- 13:08.240* :  Rubbish and creating tripping hazards,
*13:08.580- 13:09.720* :  an advocate for the blind.
*13:10.380- 13:14.240* :  She got hit by one last week in the city on the footpath.
*13:14.260- 13:17.300* :  So the nuisance, the hazard, it's a real real problem.
*13:17.500- 13:19.840* :  It was a study by the Royal Melbourne hospital
*13:19.840- 13:24.080* :  and it found that just over 250 patients were admitted
*13:24.080- 13:27.480* :  to the hospital with injuries from e-scooters
*13:27.500- 13:30.100* :  in the 12 months up to January 2023.
*13:30.960- 13:35.240* :  And that was to the tune of nearly two million Australian dollars.
*13:35.740- 13:37.740* :  Now, some accidents were deadly.
*13:38.320- 13:40.720* :  Many people not wearing helmets, accidents
*13:41.400- 13:42.680* :  involving the consumption of alcohol,
*13:42.680- 13:45.840* :  but doctors believe that the total number of patients
*13:45.940- 13:48.960* :  across the state of Victoria injured by e-scooters
*13:48.960- 13:51.340* :  is probably much higher than the official numbers.
*13:51.780- 13:53.700* :  Mayor Nicholas Reese again.
*13:54.240- 13:57.260* :  They have been issues around insurance and who's liable
*13:57.440- 13:58.480* :  when accidents occur.
*13:58.480- 14:01.940* :  So it's a very complex legal environment.
*14:02.480- 14:05.100* :  The truth is they're having too many accidents, too many injuries.
*14:05.420- 14:08.000* :  We talked to anyone up at emergency at the Royal Melbourne,
*14:08.000- 14:12.520* :  but inundated with people breaking wrists, knocking their heads.
*14:13.200- 14:15.180* :  So the operators, Lyme and Neuron,
*14:15.180- 14:18.840* :  have been given 30 days to remove the e-scooters
*14:18.860- 14:20.120* :  from the streets of Melbourne.
*14:20.480- 14:22.820* :  However, this company still has six months left
*14:23.160- 14:25.220* :  on their contracts with the city council.
*14:25.680- 14:27.400* :  They have been campaigning quite heavily
*14:27.840- 14:29.180* :  trying to petition the council,
*14:29.620- 14:32.340* :  knowing that they had just a few months left on their contracts.
*14:32.340- 14:34.440* :  They've put in lots of money and recent months
*14:34.440- 14:37.620* :  to try and improve safety and regulations.
*14:38.200- 14:41.460* :  Spokesman for Neuron said that they'd been in discussions
*14:41.660- 14:44.740* :  to try and introduce measures like restricting the scooter
*14:44.740- 14:47.660* :  used to areas that would be less congested in the city,
*14:47.660- 14:50.720* :  but they said that this goes over and above the reforms
*14:50.720- 14:52.560* :  announced by the state government.
*14:52.560- 14:54.940* :  And it's very odd that a table of proposal
*14:54.940- 14:57.440* :  for the introduction of new e-scooter technology
*14:57.440- 15:00.420* :  can also change now to become a proposal for the band.
*15:00.420- 15:03.100* :  So they're obviously disgruntled about the news.
*15:03.660- 15:04.220* :  Katie Watson.
*15:06.520- 15:08.160* :  Still to come in the global news podcast.
*15:08.680- 15:10.860* :  You have to imagine it's a tiny fishing village
*15:10.940- 15:13.920* :  that involved into this beautiful town
*15:13.920- 15:17.000* :  that attracts the wealthy and the jetset.
*15:17.540- 15:19.800* :  And the Mayor doesn't want to have
*15:19.800- 15:22.840* :  these unsightly units visible on the street.
*15:23.260- 15:25.800* :  Why residents of Portofino in Italy
*15:25.800- 15:28.340* :  are blowing hot and cold over air conditioning?
*15:37.380- 15:38.080* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*15:38.080- 15:40.540* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team
*15:40.540- 15:42.280* :  if big wireless companies are allowed
*15:42.280- 15:44.140* :  to raise prices due to inflation.
*15:44.560- 15:45.160* :  They said yes.
*15:45.620- 15:47.300* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically
*15:47.300- 15:49.580* :  violates those owners to your contracts,
*15:49.580- 15:51.940* :  they said, what the fuck are you talking about?
*15:51.960- 15:53.280* :  You insane Hollywood ass.
*15:53.300- 15:56.220* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited
*15:56.220- 15:59.120* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*15:59.240- 16:01.720* :  Give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch.
*16:01.900- 16:03.500* :  $45 a month from 3 months plus taxes and fees
*16:03.500- 16:04.720* :  from all week for new customers for limited time.
*16:04.820- 16:05.900* :  Unlimited more than 40 gigabytes per month,
*16:05.900- 16:07.240* :  so full turns at mintmobile.com.
*16:09.140- 16:11.500* :  Hello, I'm Simon Jack, the BBC's business editor.
*16:11.720- 16:14.420* :  And I'm Sing Sing and I'm a journalist, author, and podcaster.
*16:14.700- 16:15.440* :  And it's great news.
*16:15.440- 16:18.300* :  Good bad billionaire is back for a new season now
*16:18.300- 16:19.640* :  from the BBC World Service.
*16:19.880- 16:22.160* :  So if you listen to our last series, welcome back.
*16:22.160- 16:24.360* :  But if you're new to good bad billionaire,
*16:24.900- 16:25.640* :  why should people listen?
*16:26.220- 16:27.720* :  We are your new favorite podcast,
*16:27.720- 16:29.740* :  exploring the minds, the motives,
*16:30.240- 16:33.860* :  and the big money behind some of the world's richest people.
*16:34.160- 16:35.360* :  Some of these billionaire stories,
*16:35.360- 16:38.280* :  really are packed full of incident, intrigue,
*16:38.620- 16:40.040* :  villainy in some cases.
*16:40.320- 16:42.440* :  Drama, family, succession.
*16:42.680- 16:44.940* :  Yeah, if you like biopics and this series is for you.
*16:45.100- 16:47.540* :  Good bad billionaire from the BBC World Service.
*16:47.800- 16:50.060* :  Listen now wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*16:53.100- 16:53.460* :  Oh.
*16:57.180- 16:59.240* :  16 months of civil war in Sudan
*16:59.240- 17:01.920* :  have led to hundreds of thousands of people being killed
*17:01.920- 17:04.560* :  and almost 10 million fleeing their homes.
*17:05.240- 17:10.140* :  Could US-led peace talks that have got underway today end the misery?
*17:10.500- 17:11.500* :  Well, probably not.
*17:11.500- 17:14.620* :  And the reason is that neither of the two warring parties,
*17:14.660- 17:17.720* :  the government, nor the RSF paramilitary group,
*17:18.060- 17:18.620* :  are attending.
*17:19.080- 17:20.380* :  We'll hear more about that in a moment.
*17:20.380- 17:22.640* :  But first, let's get the view of James Elder
*17:23.020- 17:25.800* :  from the United Nations Children's Agency, UNICEF,
*17:26.060- 17:28.780* :  who spent the past week in the capital, Khartoum.
*17:29.160- 17:30.660* :  Khartoum is a battleground.
*17:30.660- 17:33.780* :  There's a enormous city which has just been bled of its people
*17:33.780- 17:36.180* :  and bled is unfortunately the right word
*17:36.180- 17:38.140* :  when I was in a hospital there a couple of days ago,
*17:38.900- 17:39.660* :  blood on the floor.
*17:39.660- 17:42.360* :  Again, seeing mass casualties just on that particular day
*17:42.780- 17:43.760* :  of children coming in.
*17:44.020- 17:45.400* :  That is not an irregular occurrence.
*17:45.400- 17:47.380* :  It's just because we were there.
*17:47.380- 17:48.460* :  That's why we saw it.
*17:48.460- 17:50.620* :  In this occasion, it was a group of boys
*17:50.620- 17:54.280* :  who'd been playing football at a UNICEF child-friendly space
*17:54.280- 17:55.920* :  when it was randomly shelled.
*17:56.400- 17:57.440* :  Killed a couple of those boys,
*17:57.440- 17:58.800* :  wounded the entire team,
*17:58.800- 18:00.580* :  and I spoke to the rest of the team,
*18:00.580- 18:02.000* :  most of whom were injured and said,
*18:02.080- 18:03.160* :  boys, when you're okay,
*18:03.660- 18:05.000* :  are you looking forward to playing again?
*18:05.000- 18:06.620* :  To which they said, never.
*18:07.060- 18:08.960* :  So there was psychological impact to this.
*18:08.960- 18:11.380* :  Obviously, physically, people are decimated.
*18:11.380- 18:12.920* :  They've run out of coping capacity.
*18:13.320- 18:15.840* :  Inflation of skyrocketed, they've moved three times.
*18:16.300- 18:17.380* :  They're not in their homes.
*18:17.380- 18:18.800* :  It's brutally hot.
*18:19.280- 18:20.660* :  Water systems have been destroyed.
*18:20.660- 18:22.300* :  And this, of course, is in Khartoum.
*18:22.300- 18:24.620* :  And, therefore, we've had that famine declaration.
*18:24.800- 18:27.040* :  So, across the country, and sadly,
*18:27.040- 18:29.900* :  we have one of the most shocking situations on Earth,
*18:29.900- 18:32.440* :  numerically, the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet,
*18:32.440- 18:33.300* :  and it's getting worse.
*18:33.980- 18:35.540* :  James Elder from UNICEF.
*18:36.000- 18:38.320* :  Well, let's get the latest on the peace talks in Geneva now.
*18:38.340- 18:41.020* :  I asked our Africa regional editor, Will Ross,
*18:41.020- 18:42.780* :  what chance there is of any movement?
*18:43.280- 18:46.640* :  Well, it's hard to see anything moving it towards a ceasefire,
*18:46.640- 18:48.780* :  but possibly more commitments
*18:48.780- 18:51.400* :  from the rapid support forces
*18:52.080- 18:53.380* :  to respect human rights.
*18:53.380- 18:55.280* :  I mean, critics of the RSF,
*18:55.280- 18:57.000* :  and there are so many of them in Sudan,
*18:57.000- 18:59.240* :  describe it as an appalling militia
*18:59.240- 19:01.860* :  that's carried out terrible atrocities,
*19:02.420- 19:04.720* :  many of them based on ethnic divisions,
*19:04.720- 19:06.660* :  especially in the Darfur region.
*19:07.200- 19:09.180* :  And they've put out this kind of propaganda,
*19:09.180- 19:12.380* :  saying, you know, we will protect civilians, et cetera.
*19:12.380- 19:14.320* :  But time and time again, we're seeing videos
*19:15.080- 19:17.480* :  of appalling atrocities by the RSF.
*19:18.200- 19:20.520* :  We turn now to Japan, where the Prime Minister,
*19:20.520- 19:23.440* :  Fumio Kishida, has announced that he won't compete
*19:23.440- 19:25.660* :  in next month's contest for leadership
*19:25.660- 19:27.660* :  of the governing liberal democratic party.
*19:28.240- 19:29.820* :  He's been in charge since 2021,
*19:29.820- 19:32.240* :  but support for him has massively dropped
*19:32.240- 19:35.980* :  in the wake of a corruption scandal involving party funding
*19:35.980- 19:37.620* :  and rising living costs.
*19:38.120- 19:43.000* :  Mr. Kishida's approval ratings plummeted to 15.5% last month.
*19:43.600- 19:45.740* :  Sharma Khalil is our Tokyo correspondent.
*19:46.540- 19:49.940* :  Fumio Kishida's position was becoming more untenable by the day,
*19:49.940- 19:52.460* :  the more public criticism for the way he handled
*19:52.460- 19:55.480* :  the fundraising scandal, the more unpopular he became.
*19:55.480- 19:57.080* :  And the more unpopular he became,
*19:57.080- 20:00.660* :  the more convinced the ruling liberal democratic party
*20:00.660- 20:03.860* :  that for them to survive and to get through the elections
*20:03.860- 20:06.940* :  in 2025, he could not be at the helm.
*20:06.940- 20:08.800* :  The painful irony for the Prime Minister
*20:09.240- 20:10.660* :  is that on the international stage,
*20:10.660- 20:12.180* :  he'd actually done pretty well.
*20:12.180- 20:15.580* :  Last year, he hosted the G7 in Hiroshima.
*20:15.580- 20:16.580* :  He visited Ukraine.
*20:16.580- 20:18.560* :  He improved ties with South Korea.
*20:19.080- 20:21.640* :  This year, he addressed Congress
*20:21.640- 20:24.120* :  when he was hosted by Joe Biden in DC.
*20:24.120- 20:27.280* :  And yet domestically, it is a very different picture.
*20:27.980- 20:30.120* :  At the end of last year, Japanese prosecutors
*20:30.120- 20:32.680* :  launched a criminal investigation into whether dozens
*20:32.680- 20:36.180* :  of LDP lawmakers had pocketed millions of dollars
*20:36.720- 20:40.480* :  in proceeds of fundraising events spanning five years.
*20:40.960- 20:43.780* :  It rocked the ruling party, the scandal,
*20:43.780- 20:46.900* :  and several cabinet ministers had to step down.
*20:47.240- 20:48.720* :  The Prime Minister said that he was going
*20:48.720- 20:50.520* :  to handle this issue head on.
*20:50.780- 20:52.900* :  And yet, for many, he actually hadn't.
*20:52.940- 20:56.020* :  The reforms that he introduced were seen as weak,
*20:56.020- 20:58.240* :  too little, too late, and undecisive,
*20:58.280- 21:00.880* :  and didn't really hold anyone to real account.
*21:00.880- 21:04.240* :  Remember, this is not the only scandal that rocked this party.
*21:04.660- 21:07.060* :  In 2022, weeks after the assassination
*21:07.060- 21:09.320* :  of the former Prime Minister Shinzo Abbey,
*21:09.600- 21:12.400* :  the level of involvement between the controversial
*21:12.480- 21:16.400* :  Unification Church and almost half of LDP lawmakers
*21:16.400- 21:17.440* :  have become clear.
*21:17.840- 21:20.640* :  And this relationship varied between attending church events,
*21:20.660- 21:23.580* :  financial, or political support.
*21:23.580- 21:26.580* :  As it stands, there's a great deal of mistrust
*21:26.940- 21:28.260* :  in the ruling Democratic Party,
*21:28.260- 21:31.020* :  even though the Japanese public know
*21:31.560- 21:33.840* :  that there isn't really any other option.
*21:33.840- 21:36.960* :  The opposition seems to be weak and divided.
*21:37.400- 21:39.040* :  But also remember that the Japanese public
*21:39.040- 21:41.040* :  have been watching all of this unfold
*21:41.060- 21:43.840* :  while they themselves struggle with a stagnant economy,
*21:43.840- 21:46.160* :  with a weak yen, with rising food prices,
*21:46.160- 21:50.500* :  and with average wages that have not changed for 30 years.
*21:50.860- 21:54.380* :  Formio Kishida today said that the LDP needed a new start.
*21:54.380- 21:58.220* :  It needed to convince the Japanese public that it can change.
*21:58.760- 22:01.140* :  The challenge here is whether a different person
*22:01.140- 22:04.580* :  at the top can actually restore the party's tarnished image.
*22:04.960- 22:07.680* :  Shyma Khalil, it may be the biggest name
*22:07.680- 22:09.180* :  in global coffee retail,
*22:09.180- 22:11.780* :  but all are seemingly not well at Starbucks,
*22:11.780- 22:13.260* :  the US coffee chain.
*22:13.840- 22:15.420* :  On Tuesday, I announced it was replacing
*22:15.420- 22:19.580* :  as long-standing CEO with the head of a rival consumer chain,
*22:19.580- 22:20.260* :  Chipotle.
*22:20.980- 22:23.080* :  Markets have reacted positively to the news,
*22:23.080- 22:26.320* :  given some of the issues Starbucks has been facing over the last year,
*22:26.740- 22:28.560* :  with labor unions and wage pressures,
*22:28.560- 22:32.160* :  along with poor sales growth and increased competition in China.
*22:32.740- 22:35.580* :  Jazz Brizek is a former Starbucks worker.
*22:35.580- 22:39.320* :  She was employed as a barista at a franchise in Buffalo, New York,
*22:39.920- 22:41.720* :  together with other staff in 2022.
*22:42.160- 22:44.180* :  She sought to unionize her store,
*22:44.500- 22:45.940* :  but executives pushed back,
*22:45.940- 22:50.240* :  and the row over unionization led to serious worker unrest.
*22:50.240- 22:52.980* :  The staff did vote to unionize in the end,
*22:53.020- 22:53.980* :  and according to Jazz,
*22:53.980- 22:57.340* :  who's now left the company and is claiming wrongful dismissal.
*22:57.620- 22:59.240* :  It marked the beginning of the firm,
*22:59.240- 23:01.380* :  not just losing the confidence of employees,
*23:01.940- 23:03.880* :  but also millions of customers too.
*23:04.140- 23:05.160* :  She spoke to Ed Butler.
*23:05.700- 23:10.680* :  Howard Schultz and other members of the Starbucks executive team
*23:11.140- 23:13.140* :  took unionizing extremely personally.
*23:13.180- 23:15.960* :  It was basically a referendum on him as a leader.
*23:16.520- 23:21.200* :  So Starbucks laid out a scorched earth attempt to bust the union.
*23:21.540- 23:23.440* :  They fired people, they closed stores,
*23:24.080- 23:28.640* :  they gave millions of dollars in new benefits to workers
*23:29.020- 23:31.640* :  at non-union stores in order to deny them
*23:32.200- 23:33.780* :  to workers at unionizing stores
*23:34.580- 23:37.580* :  to make the union go away, and it didn't go away.
*23:37.880- 23:40.100* :  Right, just to be clear, obviously Starbucks themselves
*23:40.100- 23:41.480* :  will contest these claims.
*23:41.480- 23:44.580* :  They say that they just didn't think it was the way to go
*23:44.580- 23:46.900* :  and that they thought that they had a better system
*23:46.900- 23:48.040* :  that was more collaborative.
*23:48.040- 23:51.440* :  But getting beyond the unionization part,
*23:52.120- 23:56.240* :  was there a sense that they were also losing sympathy
*23:56.960- 23:58.440* :  with their wider public?
*23:59.040- 24:04.460* :  I think the Palestine issue really brought the tension
*24:04.460- 24:08.660* :  between Starbucks image as a socially conscious company
*24:09.080- 24:10.120* :  and their practice.
*24:10.700- 24:13.640* :  It was October 9th that I posted the solidarity
*24:13.640- 24:17.700* :  with Palestine tweet, but it set off this whole firestorm.
*24:18.120- 24:21.320* :  You made a post online articulating
*24:21.320- 24:23.420* :  what you felt was the union view,
*24:23.780- 24:26.980* :  which was sympathetic towards Palestinians in Gaza.
*24:27.340- 24:29.860* :  Right, Starbucks sued the union,
*24:30.000- 24:33.040* :  claimed that workers were supporting terrorism,
*24:33.420- 24:34.200* :  all of these things.
*24:34.200- 24:39.500* :  And then the public responded by calling a grassroots boycott
*24:39.500- 24:42.280* :  of Starbucks that ended up becoming a global movement
*24:42.280- 24:46.700* :  in the US, in the Middle East, in Morocco, in Malaysia.
*24:47.320- 24:50.000* :  Right, lots and lots of customers were staying away.
*24:50.400- 24:53.160* :  Yes, and I think that shows the difference
*24:53.160- 24:57.740* :  between this just being an economic market question
*24:58.180- 25:03.780* :  and a much bigger issue of a company taking the wrong stance
*25:03.780- 25:06.820* :  and then losing customers as a result of that.
*25:07.040- 25:08.580* :  Because I mean, there is an argument, isn't there,
*25:08.580- 25:12.000* :  that the price of coffee has become daunting for a lot of people
*25:12.000- 25:16.620* :  with rising prices, lattes costing what, five, six, seven dollars
*25:16.620- 25:18.900* :  in some cases, it's expensive.
*25:19.260- 25:22.040* :  That's true, but I think other coffee companies
*25:22.540- 25:26.820* :  haven't seen the same stock slides that Starbucks has seen.
*25:27.400- 25:31.300* :  Starbucks itself has been saying they're still seeing the effects
*25:31.420- 25:35.020* :  of their support for Israel affecting their earnings.
*25:35.060- 25:38.320* :  So I think because Starbucks customer base
*25:38.340- 25:42.080* :  are young, progressive, care about issues,
*25:42.800- 25:45.720* :  want to see Starbucks live up to its stated values,
*25:46.200- 25:48.540* :  they would actually need to reverse course.
*25:49.040- 25:50.660* :  Do you want your job back?
*25:51.080- 25:52.020* :  I would love my job back.
*25:52.560- 25:55.100* :  Many companies have proven that they will continue
*25:55.100- 25:59.460* :  to put profit and egos ahead of workers.
*25:59.740- 26:01.740* :  And I think that's the world we live in.
*26:01.740- 26:04.880* :  But people don't unionize when they want to tear something down.
*26:04.880- 26:07.300* :  They unionize when they want to make something the best it can be.
*26:07.780- 26:10.480* :  That was the former Starbucks worker, Jazz Brizzak.
*26:11.000- 26:14.100* :  Next to the picturesque village of Portofino,
*26:14.100- 26:16.600* :  playground of the rich and well connected
*26:16.600- 26:18.160* :  on the Italian Riviera,
*26:18.700- 26:21.280* :  it's experiencing a crackdown on a piece of equipment
*26:21.280- 26:24.280* :  designed to keep everyone cool during the height of summer
*26:24.720- 26:25.940* :  air conditioning units.
*26:26.560- 26:28.720* :  Police have been ordered to smoke out anyone
*26:29.320- 26:30.320* :  installing them without permission.
*26:30.320- 26:34.400* :  Offenders face potential fines of tens of thousands of euros.
*26:35.160- 26:37.360* :  Josephine McKenna is a freelance journalist,
*26:37.360- 26:38.180* :  based in Italy.
*26:38.360- 26:40.140* :  She's been speaking to James Krumerselmi.
*26:40.760- 26:42.860* :  Anyone traveling through Italy might have seen
*26:42.860- 26:47.220* :  these air conditioning units hanging off the edge of balconies and windows.
*26:47.980- 26:49.600* :  And they're quite unsightly.
*26:49.800- 26:53.120* :  And Portofino, it's long had a reputation
*26:53.260- 26:55.620* :  for attracting the international jet set
*26:55.920- 26:58.180* :  way back to Elizabeth Taylor and Jackie Kennedy.
*26:58.900- 27:01.280* :  So it has quite a reputation to uphold.
*27:01.280- 27:04.640* :  And the mere Mateo Viecava
*27:04.820- 27:07.920* :  is really taking a hard line on these air conditioning units
*27:07.920- 27:10.640* :  because you have to imagine it's a tiny fishing village
*27:10.640- 27:13.760* :  that evolved into this beautiful town
*27:13.760- 27:16.800* :  that attracts the wealthy and the jetset.
*27:17.340- 27:18.820* :  So he doesn't want to have these
*27:19.060- 27:22.000* :  unsightly air conditioning units visible on the street.
*27:22.220- 27:24.160* :  We're talking about narrow alleyways
*27:24.160- 27:27.380* :  and the beautiful piacet that attracts plenty of tourists
*27:27.980- 27:30.080* :  I've been seeing in the Italian press stories
*27:30.080- 27:33.160* :  that people are trying to paint their air conditioning units
*27:33.440- 27:34.500* :  and disguise them.
*27:34.500- 27:36.820* :  I'm not sure if that's really possible.
*27:37.180- 27:40.120* :  So they're trying, but clearly not always succeeding
*27:40.120- 27:43.020* :  because there are some prosecution-staking place.
*27:43.520- 27:46.560* :  Yes, it seems that they're at least caught
*27:46.560- 27:50.140* :  around 20 people in the first half of the year.
*27:50.360- 27:53.220* :  And since then, another doesn't say since June.
*27:53.880- 27:55.820* :  Whether this will end up in court,
*27:56.040- 27:57.040* :  I think that's unlikely.
*27:57.120- 28:00.380* :  The mere seems to want to be reasonable about this.
*28:00.640- 28:03.000* :  But if they do end up court and they are in court
*28:03.000- 28:04.080* :  and they prosecute it,
*28:04.100- 28:07.540* :  they could be liable for fines of up to 40,000 pounds.
*28:08.140- 28:12.120* :  And this is your neighbour, snitching on neighbours, that right?
*28:12.680- 28:14.380* :  It seems to be, yes.
*28:14.380- 28:16.640* :  I've seen the word vendetta used
*28:16.840- 28:18.840* :  where there's a tip for tack going on.
*28:19.380- 28:21.840* :  Who knows what the dispute starts off as,
*28:22.020- 28:24.240* :  but it's certainly becoming an excuse for people
*28:24.240- 28:25.680* :  to dub each other in.
*28:26.160- 28:27.900* :  I'm not sure where this is going to end up,
*28:27.900- 28:29.600* :  but we're talking about a town by the way
*28:29.600- 28:32.300* :  that only has 400 permanent residents.
*28:32.840- 28:35.160* :  And of course, it swells to the thousands in the summer.
*28:35.300- 28:38.060* :  Portofino is on the mess tourism map now.
*28:38.260- 28:43.160* :  So we've got 1.3 million posts for hashtag Portofino.
*28:43.160- 28:44.420* :  I noticed today on Instagram.
*28:45.140- 28:47.760* :  So they're flooding in to this town.
*28:48.000- 28:50.240* :  And perhaps that's another reason why the residents
*28:50.440- 28:51.700* :  feel a little bit under siege
*28:52.200- 28:55.060* :  and a little bit concerned about what's going on next door.
*28:55.480- 28:58.280* :  But this mayor has taken a particularly hard line
*28:58.280- 29:00.600* :  and he did last year as well
*29:01.080- 29:03.840* :  when he introduced fines on tourists
*29:04.000- 29:05.960* :  who were loitering and taking photos
*29:06.740- 29:08.340* :  because he was concerned about the town
*29:08.340- 29:10.600* :  descending into anarchic chaos.
*29:11.220- 29:13.560* :  The Italian-based journalist Josephine McKenna.
*29:14.260- 29:16.480* :  Before we go, for those who haven't attempted it,
*29:16.480- 29:17.780* :  I'd like you to imagine
*29:18.260- 29:19.940* :  what it would be like to run a marathon.
*29:20.800- 29:23.920* :  Now, imagine running that marathon with a broken leg.
*29:24.760- 29:27.000* :  We've been hearing from someone who's done just that
*29:27.000- 29:28.180* :  at the Paris Olympics.
*29:28.480- 29:31.120* :  The remarkable British athlete, Rose Harvey.
*29:31.860- 29:35.000* :  It was literally only about a couple of weeks before
*29:35.000- 29:37.040* :  where I just had a little bit of tightness in my hip.
*29:37.220- 29:38.700* :  And to be honest, at that point,
*29:38.700- 29:39.920* :  I didn't think anything of it.
*29:40.020- 29:40.900* :  Neither did my team.
*29:40.900- 29:42.740* :  We thought it was just a bit of inflammation
*29:42.740- 29:45.860* :  and that these things always crop up for a marathon.
*29:45.860- 29:48.900* :  So many people have little niggles going into it.
*29:49.160- 29:52.000* :  When my hip started hurting just a couple of miles in,
*29:52.000- 29:53.240* :  it's just crushing.
*29:53.520- 29:54.900* :  It got really painful and I thought,
*29:55.540- 29:57.980* :  it's just nowhere I'm going to make it around 26 miles
*29:58.120- 29:58.840* :  with his pain.
*29:59.700- 30:01.940* :  But there was also part of me
*30:01.940- 30:04.200* :  which just knew it wasn't an option.
*30:05.060- 30:07.340* :  Most of my Olympic dreams were well out of the window
*30:07.340- 30:08.700* :  by about 10K.
*30:09.060- 30:12.660* :  I just had that tiny slither of hope that I could finish.
*30:13.360- 30:15.140* :  Just being part of the Olympic marathon
*30:15.140- 30:16.800* :  is an incredible experience.
*30:16.800- 30:19.860* :  I just couldn't quite give up on the last little fragment
*30:19.860- 30:20.700* :  of hope.
*30:21.100- 30:22.740* :  I'm a big believer that sometimes you win
*30:22.740- 30:23.700* :  and sometimes you learn.
*30:24.140- 30:26.340* :  I feel like this has been more on the learning side
*30:26.340- 30:27.800* :  but I have learned a lot.
*30:28.140- 30:31.820* :  And I have no doubt that it's going to make me a better athlete
*30:32.180- 30:33.340* :  for the next race.
*30:34.000- 30:35.340* :  Marathon runner, Rose Harvey.
*30:37.720- 30:38.720* :  And that's all from us for now
*30:38.720- 30:41.340* :  but there will be a new addition of the global news podcast later.
*30:41.580- 30:43.040* :  If you want a comment on this podcast
*30:43.040- 30:45.780* :  or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*30:46.060- 30:49.320* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*30:49.840- 30:51.900* :  This addition was mixed by Craig Kingham.
*30:52.140- 30:53.980* :  The producer was Nikki, Verrico
*30:54.460- 30:55.660* :  and the editor Karen Martin.
*30:55.960- 30:56.700* :  I'm Nick Marles.
*30:56.980- 30:57.600* :  Until next time.
*30:57.900- 30:58.160* :  Goodbye.
*31:07.940- 31:10.240* :  Hello, I'm Simon Jack, the BBC's business editor.
*31:10.460- 31:13.160* :  Announcing Singh and I'm a journalist author and podcaster.
*31:13.440- 31:14.180* :  And it's great news.
*31:14.180- 31:16.680* :  Good bad billionaire is back for a new season
*31:16.680- 31:18.380* :  now from the BBC World Service.
