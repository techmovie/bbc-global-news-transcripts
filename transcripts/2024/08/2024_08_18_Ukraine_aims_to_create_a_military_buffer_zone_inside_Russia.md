*01:19.100- 01:22.700* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.320- 01:30.920* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Monday the 19th of August, these are our main
*01:30.920- 01:31.480* :  stories.
*01:31.940- 01:36.960* :  President Zelensky has said that he wants to create a military buffer zone on Russian soil.
*01:37.500- 01:42.280* :  Newers Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrives in Israel to make a final push for a ceasefire
*01:42.280- 01:44.380* :  in Gaza and the release of hostages.
*01:45.020- 01:50.360* :  This arrives in Chicago where Kamala Harris will be confirmed as their candidate for U.S.
*01:50.360- 01:53.180* :  President, we hear from our North America editor.
*01:56.000- 02:06.580* :  Also in this podcast, Alan Dillon, one of France's greatest ever film stars, has died.
*02:06.860- 02:08.860* :  President Macron leads the tributes.
*02:12.660- 02:17.780* :  The Ukrainian President, for a lot of me, Zelensky has said that one aim of the cross-border
*02:17.780- 02:22.820* :  offensive in the Russian cursk region is to create a buffer zone that would prevent attacks
*02:22.820- 02:23.780* :  across the border.
*02:23.780- 02:26.760* :  He was speaking in his nightly televised address.
*02:28.580- 02:34.280* :  Today we achieve good and much needed results in destroying Russian equipment near Tourette
*02:34.440- 02:36.980* :  and all this is more than just defense for Ukraine.
*02:37.060- 02:43.540* :  This now our primary task in defensive operations overall, to destroy as much Russian war potential
*02:43.540- 02:47.880* :  as possible and conduct maximum counteroffensive actions.
*02:48.820- 02:54.000* :  This includes creating a buffer zone on the aggressor's territory, our operation in
*02:54.000- 02:54.880* :  the course region.
*02:55.320- 02:58.700* :  Earlier, Ukraine said that it had struck another bridge in Russia.
*02:59.140- 03:02.060* :  Here's our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford.
*03:02.320- 03:07.560* :  Almost two weeks after Ukrainian troops pushed across the border into Russia, it's become
*03:07.560- 03:09.380* :  unclear that they plan to stay.
*03:10.080- 03:15.760* :  Volodymyr Zelensky is now talking of creating a buffer zone in the curse region, where Ukrainian
*03:15.760- 03:18.280* :  soldiers have taken over dozens of settlements.
*03:19.120- 03:24.420* :  On Sunday, Ukraine's air forces commander announced that a second bridge there, over the
*03:24.420- 03:28.880* :  river Same, had been damaged, cutting supply lines to Russian troops.
*03:29.820- 03:35.480* :  This shocking curse has clearly boosted Ukrainian morale and it's dented Russian sense
*03:35.720- 03:37.660* :  of their own strength and safety.
*03:38.300- 03:44.360* :  It is short of infuriated Vladimir Putin, but it hasn't stored the advance of his troops
*03:44.360- 03:46.600* :  in the Donbass region of Ukraine.
*03:47.420- 03:52.960* :  As they close in on the key city of Pakrosk, Ukrainian officials have urged residents to
*03:52.960- 03:58.900* :  evacuate both for their own safety and to clear the way for Ukrainian soldiers to fight.
*03:58.900- 04:04.800* :  Sarah Reinsford, more than 100,000 Russians have fled their homes in Kursk in search of
*04:04.800- 04:09.360* :  safety among them this woman who's been speaking to the BBC's Ukraine cast.
*04:09.720- 04:13.340* :  It has been extremely anxious for this past week in Kursk.
*04:13.420- 04:15.140* :  Very frightening for everyone.
*04:15.140- 04:22.120* :  Due to this dreadful uncertainty, people really do not know what we are already supposed
*04:22.120- 04:24.080* :  to run away or stay back.
*04:24.780- 04:29.640* :  Some people are literally paralyzed by the horror of everything that's going on.
*04:30.080- 04:34.560* :  For more on how Russians are feeling about Ukraine making further gains on their soil,
*04:35.040- 04:37.800* :  Russia, editor Steve Rosenberg sent this report.
*04:38.200- 04:42.900* :  This is a election, a 700-year-old town, about 100 miles from Moscow.
*04:43.420- 04:47.460* :  And I've come here to find out what people think about the dramatic situation which has
*04:47.460- 04:50.740* :  been unfolding in Kursk region with the Ukrainian incursion.
*04:52.040- 04:56.000* :  With Ukraine and soldiers now in Russia, you both tell me that she's worried.
*04:56.020- 05:02.300* :  I can't even watch the news on TV because I start crying, she says, how is this possible?
*05:03.360- 05:04.920* :  Someone let this happen.
*05:06.500- 05:11.480* :  People here trust our soldiers to finish the job, Andrei says, and to win.
*05:13.860- 05:17.640* :  At the market, Regina is selling vegetables from her garden.
*05:19.340- 05:24.240* :  The most important thing, Regina says, is that war doesn't come here.
*05:24.740- 05:26.680* :  That they don't get all the way here.
*05:27.180- 05:31.180* :  Our soldiers, especially the commanders, must be more vigilant.
*05:33.080- 05:37.320* :  Keep in mind, this is a nation which is constantly being reminded by those in power here of
*05:37.320- 05:40.600* :  the horrors of the Second World War, the horrors of invasion.
*05:41.540- 05:44.440* :  World War II is very much part of the national psyche here.
*05:44.980- 05:51.060* :  Now, for the first time in more than 80 years, you have foreign fighters on Russian soil,
*05:51.820- 05:52.860* :  seizing Russian territory.
*05:53.480- 05:54.300* :  That's quite a shock.
*05:54.880- 05:58.380* :  Vladimir is worried, but thinks that Russia will achieve victory.
*05:59.740- 06:03.020* :  Victory is when there'll be peace, he says.
*06:05.860- 06:08.980* :  On the town square, a patriotic pop concert.
*06:11.680- 06:13.980* :  But the atmosphere is pretty subdued.
*06:14.200- 06:20.000* :  People do seem worried, very worried, by the situation in Kursk region, by the Ukrainian attack.
*06:20.600- 06:22.920* :  People do want peace, there's no doubt about it.
*06:23.340- 06:27.740* :  But here's the thing, they still seem to trust the man running the country, President Putin,
*06:28.120- 06:29.540* :  to secure that peace for them.
*06:29.880- 06:34.760* :  The same leader who two and a half years ago launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
*06:35.500- 06:36.400* :  Steve Rosenberg.
*06:37.520- 06:41.540* :  It's his ninth visit to the Middle East since the start of the war in Gaza.
*06:41.540- 06:47.620* :  The U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is now in Israel as part of Washington's intensifying
*06:47.620- 06:50.100* :  diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire.
*06:50.460- 06:55.700* :  America and fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar said they were closing in on a deal.
*06:56.120- 07:01.720* :  But the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of sabotaging efforts to reach
*07:01.720- 07:02.200* :  a deal.
*07:02.400- 07:05.840* :  He told his cabinet that he can't compromise on some points.
*07:07.440- 07:12.180* :  I want to emphasize that we're conducting negotiations and not that we just give and give.
*07:12.180- 07:16.640* :  There are things we can be flexible on and there are things we cannot be flexible on,
*07:16.980- 07:18.160* :  which we will insist on.
*07:18.520- 07:21.120* :  We know how to distinguish between the two very well.
*07:21.300- 07:26.140* :  Our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman is traveling with Mr Blinken, who arrived
*07:26.140- 07:27.760* :  in Tel Aviv on Sunday.
*07:28.080- 07:33.780* :  The air is stick around him with a bit of optimism and a lot of expectation as we headed
*07:33.780- 07:39.520* :  in via the motorcade from Ben Gurin Airport to Tel Aviv, you can almost feel the sense
*07:39.520- 07:42.640* :  of pressure that the Americans want to apply.
*07:43.200- 07:45.060* :  He's going to meet Benjamin Netanyahu in the morning.
*07:45.060- 07:50.440* :  I think the purpose of that is to say to him, look, stop trying to squeeze any further
*07:50.440- 07:52.300* :  concessions out of this in the last minutes.
*07:52.860- 07:55.180* :  This is as good as it's going to get take a deal.
*07:55.660- 08:01.140* :  They'll probably repeat that message via Egyptian mediators when he heads to Egypt on Tuesday
*08:01.820- 08:02.300* :  as well.
*08:02.300- 08:05.640* :  But it is trying to bridge these final gaps.
*08:06.220- 08:10.660* :  I think the problem with that is that this is the diplomatic part of all this.
*08:10.980- 08:15.120* :  The reality of these talks is they're extremely technical and extremely challenging.
*08:15.280- 08:21.160* :  They're being run by spy chiefs, it's the CIA, Mossad, Egyptian intelligence, running
*08:21.160- 08:21.940* :  much of this.
*08:22.440- 08:26.820* :  What we had in Doha was a couple of days last week where much of the discussion was around
*08:26.860- 08:30.480* :  the Israeli hostage for Palestinian prisoner exchange.
*08:30.520- 08:33.700* :  That's known in the jargon of the talks as the Keynes.
*08:34.000- 08:38.540* :  The other part is about what the situation on the ground will be at the end of this war.
*08:39.000- 08:42.340* :  The Israelis want to keep boots on the ground, particularly in the south and in the center
*08:42.340- 08:43.220* :  of the Gaza Strip.
*08:43.480- 08:44.860* :  Hamas is saying no way.
*08:45.280- 08:47.740* :  And so that deadlock has not been broken.
*08:47.820- 08:50.980* :  We've still got very defined statements from both sides.
*08:51.560- 08:57.140* :  We don't know how the Americans fundamentally plan to bridge that, but what they're saying
*08:57.140- 09:04.120* :  is effectively take the deal now because if time wears on even more, it simply won't
*09:04.120- 09:09.900* :  be available because of the horrendous numbers of civilians, Palestinians have been killed
*09:09.940- 09:11.340* :  by the Israelis we're seeing in Gaza.
*09:11.700- 09:16.460* :  And because of the toll time takes on the welfare of the hostages, the more things go on,
*09:16.460- 09:21.220* :  they are saying really the energy that's spent on this gets much harder to do.
*09:21.380- 09:26.280* :  Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Hamas of trying to sabotage any deal.
*09:26.280- 09:30.760* :  Hamas, though, have said that the mediators are selling illusions.
*09:30.760- 09:32.820* :  Are these just negotiating positions?
*09:32.860- 09:37.900* :  I think when you see these sort of very defined statements, my sense is from the Americans
*09:37.900- 09:41.740* :  at least that they don't think that's really what's going on in the room, that there is
*09:41.740- 09:46.280* :  more of a willingness to try to come to compromise.
*09:46.280- 09:50.320* :  And so you're going to hear these very tough public statements around the edges of it all.
*09:50.660- 09:55.120* :  But I think what I would say to that is at the moment, it feels to me like, remember
*09:55.120- 09:57.880* :  the backdrop of this, the Americans is a presidential election.
*09:58.280- 10:02.480* :  For a democratic administration, the closer you get to November the 5th, the harder it is
*10:03.080- 10:08.620* :  for them to use political energy and bandwidth on repeated trips to the Middle East for
*10:08.620- 10:13.060* :  Antilly Blinker, for the president to be bashing the phones to try and knock heads together
*10:13.060- 10:13.740* :  to do this.
*10:14.060- 10:20.360* :  So the American clock is ticking quicker than that for the two sides involved in this.
*10:20.360- 10:22.200* :  And I think that's still a fundamental problem.
*10:22.320- 10:26.020* :  So when the Americans talk about potentially achieving something within a week, you know,
*10:26.020- 10:27.720* :  I think many perhaps also ought to miss it.
*10:27.960- 10:30.940* :  And what are the hopes in the wider region for a peace deal?
*10:30.980- 10:35.620* :  Here's our senior international correspondent, Alla Garen, who's in Beirut.
*10:35.980- 10:39.420* :  At this stage, it's more a case of fear than of hope.
*10:40.000- 10:44.960* :  Here in Lebanon, for example, there are very real concerns about the danger of being dragged
*10:44.960- 10:47.640* :  into a war between Hezbollah and Lebanon.
*10:48.220- 10:51.540* :  The caretaker government is actually making emergency plans.
*10:51.540- 10:58.780* :  It's stockpiling medicine and food, but it only has the capacity to store fuel for five
*10:58.900- 10:59.220* :  weeks.
*10:59.420- 11:03.400* :  So people here are worried that they could be caught in the middle of this and that it
*11:03.400- 11:04.700* :  could happen soon.
*11:05.400- 11:11.340* :  I think broadly in the region, there is skepticism about the idea that Prime Minister Netanyahu
*11:11.380- 11:14.720* :  actually wants to deal whatever he may be saying.
*11:15.480- 11:22.840* :  He has been accused by some in Israel's own security establishment by leaks from Israel's
*11:22.840- 11:28.780* :  negotiating team and, indeed, by some of the hostage families of throwing a wrench in
*11:29.080- 11:32.860* :  in all the previous negotiations every time a deal looked close.
*11:33.520- 11:38.200* :  Now don't forget two ministers, far-right ministers in his own government, have threatened
*11:38.200- 11:40.460* :  to quit if there is a ceasefire deal.
*11:40.940- 11:46.420* :  So there is a feeling in the region that Prime Minister Netanyahu says cannot be taken
*11:46.420- 11:47.380* :  at face value.
*11:47.840- 11:52.400* :  Hamas are presenting a very negative picture, perhaps, to try to improve their negotiating
*11:52.440- 11:53.080* :  position.
*11:53.680- 11:57.720* :  But as things stand from what we know now, the two sides remain far apart.
*11:57.720- 12:02.420* :  And even though this big push is happening this week, there's no indication yet.
*12:02.420- 12:06.720* :  It will be possible to get the two sides to bridge the difference between them.
*12:08.440- 12:13.700* :  One reason the US is exerting so much pressure for a speedy ceasefire deal is the looming
*12:13.700- 12:18.520* :  presidential election, pitting the former President, Donald Trump, against the current
*12:18.520- 12:20.340* :  Vice President, Kamalat Harris.
*12:20.760- 12:26.340* :  The race is ramping up with the Democratic National Convention kicking off on Monday in
*12:26.340- 12:26.720* :  Chicago.
*12:26.820- 12:32.480* :  There, Ms Harris is due to be formally confirmed as the party's presidential nominee.
*12:33.040- 12:38.180* :  In the meantime, she's been out campaigning in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.
*12:38.680- 12:40.440* :  We know what we stand for.
*12:41.020- 12:46.740* :  And one of the beautiful things about these next 79 days is what the people in this room
*12:46.740- 12:48.540* :  have already been doing and know.
*12:49.460- 12:50.700* :  Let's build community.
*12:51.460- 12:53.200* :  That's what this campaign is about.
*12:53.200- 12:55.200* :  Yes, it is about winning, and we will win.
*12:55.920- 12:56.860* :  And we will win.
*12:57.700- 12:59.020* :  And we will win.
*12:59.520- 13:03.720* :  Our North America editor, Sarah Smith, is in Chicago for the convention.
*13:03.720- 13:07.280* :  She says the spotlight will firmly be on Ms Harris.
*13:07.620- 13:09.060* :  This is very much per week.
*13:09.060- 13:13.000* :  She's going to be publicly crowned as the Democrats presidential candidate.
*13:13.580- 13:17.920* :  You know, it's only four weeks ago that Joe Biden stepped aside, but in that time, this
*13:17.920- 13:20.240* :  race has been completely transformed.
*13:20.960- 13:23.480* :  Kamala Harris is energetically campaigning.
*13:23.480- 13:28.300* :  And what is quite remarkable about all of these events are the levels of excitement and
*13:28.300- 13:30.700* :  enthusiasm she's greeted with, wherever she goes.
*13:31.260- 13:35.520* :  And the opinion polls suggest that support for her is growing too, where Joe Biden was
*13:35.840- 13:40.880* :  often a few points behind Donald Trump, Kamala Harris nationally is a couple of points
*13:41.060- 13:45.620* :  ahead and also ahead in the key swing states, where those votes really matter.
*13:46.220- 13:49.720* :  It's not going to be all plain sailing this week, though there are some very large demonstration
*13:50.220- 13:53.280* :  plans, which will highlight divisions within the Democratic Party.
*13:53.600- 13:59.020* :  Instantly, over America's support for Israel's war on Gaza, which many are furious about
*13:59.340- 14:02.640* :  and could cost the Democrats significant numbers of votes in November.
*14:03.540- 14:08.780* :  And as the baton has passed here in Chicago from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris, tributes will
*14:08.780- 14:13.560* :  be paid to Mr Biden, but it's going to be a bittersweet week for him, I think, because
*14:13.560- 14:18.400* :  he remains as the president of the United States, and yet it's very clear that Kamala
*14:18.400- 14:20.860* :  Harris is very much going to be the star of the show here.
*14:22.800- 14:27.360* :  Francis President Emmanuel Macron has led tributes to one of his country's greatest
*14:27.360- 14:30.920* :  film stars, Alain Delaun, who has died at the age of 88.
*14:30.920- 14:36.240* :  He described him as a French monument, who embodied legendary roles and made the world
*14:36.380- 14:36.720* :  dream.
*14:37.020- 14:42.600* :  Delaun's friend and fellow star Brigitte Bardot said he left a deep void that no one could
*14:42.620- 14:42.880* :  fill.
*14:43.340- 14:48.540* :  He featured in almost 90 films, including The Leopard, The Swimming Pool, and Plas
*14:49.520- 14:52.040* :  often cast as a seductive anti-hero.
*14:52.040- 14:57.020* :  He was known for his good looks, tough guy performances, and tempestuous private life.
*14:57.420- 15:03.940* :  In an interview with the BBC in 1969 at the height of his fame, Delaun was asked what were
*15:03.940- 15:05.540* :  his faults, as well as his strengths.
*15:05.900- 15:11.140* :  As an actor, I'm not, I'm not afraid to say that my first quality, it's to be a professional
*15:11.660- 15:13.440* :  and it's many, many things.
*15:13.840- 15:16.100* :  As a fort, it's rather difficult to say.
*15:16.520- 15:21.540* :  It would be my anger, but especially by things not going fast enough.
*15:22.020- 15:28.200* :  But anyway, I don't many care what people think, what scound, it's what I think of myself
*15:28.200- 15:30.180* :  and what I think of what I do.
*15:30.780- 15:34.120* :  I think that for the audience, they like me or they dislike me.
*15:34.200- 15:34.700* :  That's all.
*15:35.080- 15:40.120* :  Alain Delaun was once described as the most beautiful man in the movies, but he courted
*15:40.120- 15:45.920* :  controversy in later life by supporting his friend Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of
*15:45.920- 15:49.920* :  the far right national front, who opposed same-sex marriage.
*15:49.940- 15:55.300* :  Oliver Conway heard more about Delaun's career from the arts journalist Vincent Dowd.
*15:55.420- 16:00.420* :  I would say, Alain Delaun was just about the biggest male star of French cinema in
*16:00.420- 16:02.080* :  the 60s and for a few years afterwards.
*16:02.080- 16:06.220* :  His only rival, I suppose, would be Jean-Paul Belmondo, who died in 2021.
*16:06.860- 16:11.900* :  The obvious difference was that Belmondo had a strong and unforgettable cinematic face,
*16:11.900- 16:17.680* :  whereas Alain Delaun, as a young man, anyway, was the great male beauty of the France of
*16:17.680- 16:18.240* :  his era.
*16:18.240- 16:22.160* :  You might say, the male equivalent of Catherine De Nervin, of course, the French New
*16:22.160- 16:26.420* :  Valle d'Ug, the new wave, was hugely popular around the world, not just in Europe.
*16:26.560- 16:29.800* :  So he rode that wave as cinema was kind of reinvented.
*16:29.800- 16:32.100* :  He was born just outside Paris in 1935.
*16:32.600- 16:36.780* :  He became known in France in his early 20s when he starred opposite Rommie Schneider in
*16:36.780- 16:37.340* :  Christine.
*16:37.340- 16:40.980* :  And though they never married, Delaun and Rommie Schneider got together for a few years
*16:41.000- 16:41.840* :  in real life, too.
*16:41.840- 16:47.320* :  They were the ultimate young, appealing romantic leads at newspapers love the fact that his
*16:47.320- 16:49.400* :  romantic life was always, shall we say, complex.
*16:50.040- 16:55.660* :  In 1963, his role in the Le Pen directed by Visconti brought him a kind of international
*16:56.280- 16:56.300* :  celebrity.
*16:56.340- 17:01.580* :  Bert Lancaster was the main star, but that film did seem to push Delaun a little further
*17:01.860- 17:03.740* :  towards international stardom.
*17:03.960- 17:07.700* :  I mean, how well-known was the outside Europe and France?
*17:07.720- 17:12.960* :  It's very interesting, Oli, because you would have thought you would become a massive star
*17:12.960- 17:15.460* :  in the UK and everywhere, and in the USA.
*17:16.140- 17:19.680* :  It never quite happened, although he had big movies.
*17:19.680- 17:24.020* :  I think if you look at Plan Salle, or Purple Nune, as it's known in the UK version, the
*17:24.020- 17:28.260* :  English version, that version of talented Mr Ripley, he's very good.
*17:28.260- 17:32.340* :  As it happens, I watched it about a month ago, just on TV, and I thought, even 60 years
*17:32.340- 17:33.840* :  later, it works very well.
*17:34.460- 17:39.020* :  He persuades as a charmer when the role demands it, and he's frightening when he needs to
*17:39.020- 17:39.200* :  be.
*17:39.640- 17:41.940* :  But there's always something quite dark underneath.
*17:41.980- 17:47.880* :  Now in Plan Salle, or the talented Mr Ripley version, that works, but maybe Hollywood was
*17:47.880- 17:52.900* :  less interested in him for the bigger romantic scenes, which is how they look at a French
*17:52.900- 17:54.240* :  or an Italian actor, of course.
*17:54.600- 17:58.900* :  I mean, if you remember, in this version, at least, he stabs Dickie Greenleaf to death
*17:58.900- 18:04.920* :  in a small boat, and he goes from being charming to being absolutely violent and actually quite
*18:04.920- 18:05.420* :  frightening.
*18:05.920- 18:07.040* :  Vincent Dowd.
*18:09.360- 18:11.000* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*18:11.140- 18:19.940* :  The bear just dropped down on the top of my tent and started ripping and biting, and he
*18:19.940- 18:21.880* :  did get me out by my head.
*18:22.460- 18:27.160* :  A miraculous escape, but survivor Matt Dyer doesn't blame his attacker.
*18:36.860- 18:39.480* :  It took a lifetime to find the person you want to marry.
*18:39.900- 18:42.740* :  Finding the perfect engagement ring is a lot easier.

*19:06.860- 19:07.620* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*19:07.620- 19:11.580* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*19:11.900- 19:12.900* :  They charge you a lot.
*19:12.940- 19:14.240* :  We charge you a little.
*19:14.560- 19:19.060* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided
*19:19.060- 19:21.960* :  to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*19:22.260- 19:22.620* :  That's right.
*19:22.620- 19:27.200* :  We're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*19:27.660- 19:30.120* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.
*19:30.120- 19:32.880* :  $45 up from payment equivalent to $15 per month.
*19:32.880- 19:34.380* :  New customers on first three month plan only.
*19:34.380- 19:35.220* :  Taxes and fees extra.
*19:41.820- 19:41.940* :  Speed slower above 40 gigabyte CDTL.
*19:41.940- 19:47.240* :  The World Health Organization has named MPOX a global health emergency, but that alert
*19:47.240- 19:49.780* :  level has been in place for some time across Africa.
*19:50.260- 19:56.260* :  More than 18,000 cases and 500 deaths have been reported in Africa since January, largely
*19:56.260- 19:58.500* :  in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
*19:58.940- 20:04.300* :  South Africa's president, Siror Ramaposa, who also leads the African Union's Pandemic
*20:04.300- 20:09.240* :  Response Committee, has called an emergency meeting with health officials to discuss what
*20:09.240- 20:11.720* :  he calls the disease's rapid spread.
*20:12.180- 20:18.460* :  Africa, regional editor Richard Kagoy told me South Africa wants a coordinated response.
*20:18.940- 20:24.780* :  It's a huge concern in South Africa because South Africa had reported a couple of cases
*20:24.780- 20:26.960* :  at some time in the month of June.
*20:27.240- 20:32.240* :  And up to date, we're looking at about 24 cases which have been confirmed and our five
*20:32.240- 20:33.380* :  deaths are so far.
*20:33.720- 20:39.000* :  And South Africa was quite devastated during the COVID pandemic, of course, had the biggest
*20:39.020- 20:42.180* :  number of fatalities and cases in the continent.
*20:42.700- 20:47.620* :  And so just looking at how the situation is currently in the Democratic Republic of
*20:47.620- 20:52.740* :  Congo and the surrounding regions, then this has really been a major concern for him looking
*20:52.740- 20:54.360* :  at preparedness and our response.
*20:54.420- 20:56.520* :  So what kind of response?
*20:56.860- 21:04.580* :  So basically, they will jointly agree in terms of surveillance, diagnosis testing, also
*21:04.580- 21:11.560* :  looking at how they can jointly lobby for the supply of vaccines, because the anti-continent
*21:11.560- 21:13.520* :  needs about 10 million doses.
*21:14.140- 21:19.640* :  And so far, just indications we're receiving from the Danish drug maker, a very Nordic,
*21:20.000- 21:24.320* :  says that they can only supply about 2 million doses by the end of this year.
*21:24.740- 21:29.160* :  So it's that kind of approach that the regional heads of state are looking at.
*21:29.340- 21:34.240* :  Just tell us about the disease itself, because a lot of people don't really know much
*21:34.240- 21:34.760* :  about it.
*21:34.760- 21:35.600* :  What does it do?
*21:35.740- 21:36.720* :  Why is it so dangerous?
*21:36.980- 21:42.520* :  So the strain which is detected in East and the Erkongo last year is deadly, deadly
*21:42.520- 21:48.440* :  in the sense that a lot of people who have been infected by the virus and die within a
*21:48.440- 21:49.680* :  very short span of time.
*21:50.020- 21:55.780* :  And the thing is that this new strain, it doesn't quite sort of like a display immediate symptoms.
*21:55.780- 21:57.320* :  It gives very mild symptoms.
*21:57.840- 22:02.240* :  And what happens then, a lot of people are spreading the disease in their households
*22:02.240- 22:04.320* :  and within their social contacts.
*22:04.800- 22:10.040* :  And that's why we're seeing, you know, a rapid spread of the disease outside the region
*22:10.040- 22:14.240* :  within the Congo basin where it is endemic to other parts of the continent.
*22:14.260- 22:17.760* :  And there's still those awful sores that appear on people's faces.
*22:18.380- 22:24.520* :  Yes, you get all that appearing in your faces on your hands and also on your genitals,
*22:24.520- 22:30.940* :  because you see this particular strain is now majorly transmitted through a sexual and
*22:30.940- 22:32.200* :  a physical contact.
*22:32.540- 22:36.300* :  Has this got the potential to turn into a global pandemic?
*22:36.300- 22:38.120* :  I think there are every indications.
*22:38.340- 22:43.980* :  Previous cases have only just been confined to central Africa and parts of West Africa.
*22:44.440- 22:49.800* :  But what we have seen is that because of cross-border movement, the disease has now spread
*22:49.800- 22:53.580* :  to areas within the continent which are previously not affected.
*22:53.580- 22:58.500* :  They never reported these cases in Eastern Africa and also parts of southern Africa.
*22:59.040- 23:03.520* :  We have seen also cases being detected in Sweden and also in Pakistan.
*23:03.540- 23:07.100* :  I think the challenge is in terms of how do you contain this?
*23:07.140- 23:11.120* :  How do you stop this from being exported to other parts of the world?
*23:11.120- 23:12.760* :  I guess that's the million-dollar question.
*23:12.780- 23:17.780* :  And when it comes to, you know, thinking how do we respond to this outbreak?
*23:18.300- 23:19.280* :  Richard Kegoy.
*23:20.380- 23:26.240* :  Bangladesh is home to around a million Rohingya refugees who fled violence and persecution
*23:26.360- 23:27.540* :  in neighboring Myanmar.
*23:28.080- 23:31.380* :  In his first major speech as the acting leader of Bangladesh,
*23:31.380- 23:34.460* :  Mohamed Yunus has tried to give them some reassurance.
*23:34.480- 23:38.580* :  Speaking on Sunday, he said that his government would do its best to help her hinges
*23:38.960- 23:41.160* :  who've settled in the camps in Bangladesh.
*23:41.580- 23:43.940* :  Our government will continue to support the millions,
*23:44.020- 23:48.200* :  million plus Rohingya people sheltered in Bangladesh.
*23:48.820- 23:52.100* :  We need sustained efforts of the international community
*23:53.280- 23:54.900* :  for Rohingya humanitarian operations
*23:55.820- 23:59.660* :  and their eventual deportation to their homeland, Myanmar,
*24:00.640- 24:02.980* :  with safety, dignity and food rights.
*24:03.180- 24:06.920* :  I heard more from our reporter, Akbar Hussein, in the capital Dhaka.
*24:07.220- 24:10.480* :  Today, he was addressing the diplomats in Dhaka
*24:11.180- 24:15.360* :  and the United States, UK, European Union and other countries
*24:15.720- 24:17.420* :  and diplomats who are posted in Dhaka.
*24:17.420- 24:18.180* :  They joined there.
*24:18.240- 24:22.940* :  Mr. Yunus said that Rohingya issue is a priority for the government.
*24:22.940- 24:27.100* :  Then Bangladesh is hosting more than one million Rohingya
*24:27.100- 24:29.000* :  for last eight years.
*24:29.300- 24:33.060* :  So he said that the support from the international community
*24:33.060- 24:36.740* :  is absolutely imperative because without international support,
*24:36.740- 24:38.900* :  Bangladesh alone cannot handle this matter.
*24:38.900- 24:42.260* :  That's why he said that Rohingya is one of the priorities
*24:42.260- 24:43.180* :  of his government.
*24:43.180- 24:46.180* :  And he said that at the same time, Bangladesh is hosting them,
*24:46.180- 24:49.260* :  but Bangladesh's main objective is to send back Rohingyas
*24:49.780- 24:53.100* :  to their own countries, Myanmar, with dignity and safety.
*24:53.280- 24:56.000* :  Because, as you say, around a million refugees,
*24:56.720- 24:58.740* :  which is a lot of refugees to take care of
*24:58.740- 25:01.740* :  and the conditions in the camps are set by many to be terrible.
*25:02.100- 25:05.240* :  That is true, because another Bangladesh is a poor country
*25:05.840- 25:09.380* :  and this is very impossible thing for Bangladesh
*25:09.380- 25:12.120* :  to host such a huge number of refugees.
*25:12.920- 25:16.900* :  And when this refugee crisis started in 2016,
*25:17.920- 25:20.040* :  since then, in the eight years had been passed,
*25:20.240- 25:22.260* :  but there is no sign of repatriation.
*25:22.960- 25:24.960* :  And one Bangladesh government, you know,
*25:24.960- 25:27.740* :  before when she had seen as government was in power,
*25:27.740- 25:30.640* :  and in the last, you know, on 5th of August,
*25:30.640- 25:32.940* :  they were overthrown by a mass uprising.
*25:33.580- 25:36.380* :  And that government, they were kept telling that Bangladesh
*25:36.380- 25:38.700* :  was trying to repatriate Rohingya communities,
*25:39.340- 25:40.980* :  people to their own countries, Myanmar,
*25:41.000- 25:44.120* :  but the cooperation from Myanmar is not enough
*25:44.120- 25:46.040* :  and they are not responding positively.
*25:46.040- 25:48.640* :  That's why Bangladesh failed to do so.
*25:49.280- 25:50.880* :  So now, Professor Muhammad Yunos,
*25:51.020- 25:54.220* :  he is not trying to convince the international community
*25:54.220- 25:56.420* :  that without their support from,
*25:56.420- 25:58.360* :  especially from the Western support,
*25:58.900- 26:01.940* :  Bangladesh cannot alone feed those people
*26:02.620- 26:06.320* :  and cannot actually meet the basic needs of the refugees.
*26:06.980- 26:09.880* :  So in the camps, they are living in a precarious condition.
*26:10.480- 26:12.440* :  So what the Professor Muhammad Yunos government,
*26:13.000- 26:14.220* :  interim government, they said that
*26:14.640- 26:17.520* :  if they get more support from the international community,
*26:18.200- 26:20.080* :  that will be very helpful for the people
*26:20.100- 26:22.480* :  who are suffering from Rohingya camps.
*26:22.980- 26:24.060* :  Akbar Hussein.
*26:24.380- 26:26.760* :  The British government has said that it intends to treat
*26:26.760- 26:29.620* :  misogyny, prejudice, or hatred against women,
*26:29.920- 26:32.320* :  like it would an extremist ideology.
*26:32.860- 26:35.160* :  The Home Secretary or Interior Minister,
*26:35.160- 26:37.920* :  Yvette Cooper, has said that she would review
*26:37.920- 26:39.600* :  gaps in current legislation,
*26:40.120- 26:42.360* :  apolitical correspondence, Charlotte Rose,
*26:42.700- 26:45.560* :  gave more details to my colleague, Martin Croxel.
*26:45.860- 26:47.700* :  She's our civil servants to look at
*26:48.520- 26:50.100* :  what are the particular activities
*26:50.100- 26:53.620* :  that both promote violence and also undermine democracy.
*26:53.660- 26:55.580* :  She says that they'll be looking at both the rise
*26:55.580- 26:59.200* :  and far-right ideology, also Islamist extremism,
*26:59.520- 27:02.260* :  and now, of course, extreme misogyny.
*27:02.600- 27:05.740* :  But she says also, extremism that fits into broader categories,
*27:05.740- 27:08.040* :  like fixation on violence.
*27:08.100- 27:11.860* :  This was something that was in Labour's manifesto
*27:11.860- 27:13.660* :  during the election, so it's obviously something
*27:13.660- 27:16.220* :  the party has been thinking about for some time.
*27:16.400- 27:18.860* :  How clear is it at the moment what they mean
*27:18.860- 27:20.660* :  by extreme misogyny?
*27:20.880- 27:22.420* :  I think that's not clear at the moment,
*27:22.420- 27:25.080* :  and certainly the government hasn't set it out specifically,
*27:25.100- 27:27.420* :  but I think if we look at the kinds of things
*27:27.420- 27:28.560* :  we might be talking about,
*27:28.580- 27:30.500* :  there has for a long time been a concern
*27:31.020- 27:33.260* :  about something that was known as in-sell culture.
*27:33.340- 27:34.820* :  Now, this was an online movement
*27:34.820- 27:36.460* :  that tended to involve young men,
*27:36.900- 27:40.180* :  those who described themselves as involuntarily celibate,
*27:40.640- 27:43.660* :  and that was linked to the Plymouth shootings in 2021,
*27:43.760- 27:47.140* :  when a 22-year-old J. Davison killed five people,
*27:47.140- 27:50.060* :  including his mother before fatally shooting himself.
*27:50.580- 27:52.460* :  That was linked to that online movement,
*27:52.460- 27:55.580* :  and, of course, seeing the popularity of social media
*27:55.580- 27:57.340* :  influencers like Andrew Tate,
*27:57.620- 28:00.100* :  and the huge following that he has in particular
*28:00.540- 28:03.020* :  amongst young men right across the world,
*28:03.280- 28:05.200* :  I think that is something that has perhaps prompted
*28:05.200- 28:07.640* :  the government to say we need to look at this formally.
*28:07.900- 28:10.480* :  I imagine as well there will be a number of women's groups
*28:10.520- 28:11.920* :  who want to have some input,
*28:11.920- 28:15.300* :  because we've seen some terrible stuff happen online to women.
*28:15.460- 28:16.360* :  That's absolutely correct.
*28:16.360- 28:19.100* :  We've seen terrible things happening both in the real world
*28:19.100- 28:21.680* :  and online, and obviously Jess Phillips,
*28:21.680- 28:24.160* :  who's now a government minister for tackling violence
*28:24.160- 28:25.260* :  against women and girls,
*28:25.700- 28:28.340* :  has long talked about the fact that very little in-road
*28:28.340- 28:31.760* :  has been made on tackling abuse both online,
*28:31.880- 28:33.460* :  but also the number of homicides
*28:33.980- 28:36.420* :  and violent crimes committed against women.
*28:36.980- 28:38.900* :  So I think this is something that those groups
*28:38.900- 28:40.620* :  will certainly be very pleased to hear,
*28:40.940- 28:42.540* :  but, of course, we'll want to know the details.
*28:43.020- 28:43.800* :  Charlotte Rose.
*28:44.840- 28:50.100* :  Last week, a radar station worker in Canada's Northern Nunavut
*28:50.100- 28:53.100* :  territory was killed in an attack by two polar bears,
*28:53.360- 28:55.560* :  such killings are relatively rare,
*28:55.560- 28:58.300* :  but interactions between bears and humans are growing
*28:58.300- 29:00.300* :  as a result of expanding neighborhoods.
*29:00.800- 29:02.920* :  Matt Dyer from the US State of Maine
*29:03.400- 29:05.520* :  is one of the few people to survive
*29:05.520- 29:07.220* :  and encounter with a polar bear.
*29:07.220- 29:11.500* :  He was on a hiking trip in the Canadian wilderness in 2013,
*29:12.360- 29:13.900* :  and has been speaking to Paul Henley.
*29:14.220- 29:17.500* :  I woke up and I could see the shadow
*29:17.500- 29:21.340* :  of the front legs of a bear over the top of my tent,
*29:22.240- 29:26.700* :  and I knew what was about to happen
*29:26.700- 29:31.400* :  and that the bear just dropped down on the top of my tent
*29:31.500- 29:33.960* :  and started pulling, you know,
*29:33.960- 29:35.520* :  trying to get me out of it, you know,
*29:35.520- 29:40.460* :  ripping and biting, and he did give me out by my head.
*29:40.940- 29:43.120* :  This bear had your head in its jaws?
*29:44.260- 29:46.900* :  Yes, he or she, in fact, did.
*29:48.740- 29:50.800* :  You were fully conscious all during this attack.
*29:50.800- 29:51.420* :  What happened?
*29:52.540- 29:56.320* :  Well, I can remember hitting the ground
*29:56.660- 30:01.500* :  and I could smell breath, this was a pretty bad.
*30:02.420- 30:07.440* :  And I could feel the bones in my neck and had cracking.
*30:07.680- 30:08.740* :  I mean, I could hear it.
*30:08.740- 30:12.300* :  I remember the voice of myself talking to myself,
*30:12.300- 30:14.820* :  saying, well, you're going to die now.
*30:15.040- 30:17.740* :  And the other voice said, I know.
*30:18.500- 30:20.640* :  I can remember thinking, I wonder what it's going to be like
*30:20.640- 30:21.240* :  to be dead.
*30:21.800- 30:22.980* :  You know, you didn't die.
*30:23.520- 30:27.180* :  Well, because the people I was with acted quickly,
*30:27.180- 30:29.840* :  a rich, gross, had a flare gun.
*30:29.840- 30:31.800* :  That was the only kind of weapon we had.
*30:32.060- 30:33.560* :  It wasn't even a weapon, you know.
*30:33.820- 30:37.400* :  And he shot that flare gun off and that bear dropped me.
*30:37.600- 30:37.920* :  Boom.
*30:38.800- 30:41.260* :  And I could hear him walking off.
*30:42.280- 30:43.860* :  Then I could hear him coming back.
*30:43.860- 30:46.060* :  And I'm laying there, I couldn't move for anything.
*30:46.620- 30:50.620* :  And I remember thinking, just go away, go away.
*30:51.060- 30:54.420* :  And another flare went over, rich shot another flare off.
*30:54.840- 30:56.780* :  And that bear took off.
*30:57.400- 30:58.760* :  And I was safe.
*30:58.760- 31:02.340* :  You had to wait what, seven hours to be airlifted out
*31:02.340- 31:03.720* :  for proper medical attention.
*31:04.160- 31:07.760* :  Now, I was in and out of consciousness through that time.
*31:07.820- 31:10.700* :  There were things I remember, I remember the smell of coffee.
*31:10.700- 31:13.400* :  I can remember just being very grateful.
*31:13.900- 31:15.000* :  I knew I was going to be fine.
*31:15.240- 31:17.140* :  I don't think they knew I was going to be fine.
*31:17.580- 31:19.320* :  And I didn't have a lot of pain.
*31:19.320- 31:20.600* :  I had some low back pain.
*31:20.980- 31:22.820* :  I was not like suffering.
*31:23.460- 31:25.340* :  And what were your actual injuries,
*31:25.340- 31:28.040* :  which you're mainly recovered from now, right?
*31:28.300- 31:30.200* :  Well, it was all head injuries pretty much.
*31:30.220- 31:34.200* :  He cracked some vertebrae in my neck, broke my jaw,
*31:34.660- 31:37.240* :  collapsed the lung, bit through one of my hands.
*31:37.380- 31:39.640* :  And I get a little, you know, when things get damp,
*31:39.640- 31:42.740* :  damp weather now, I get those aches in there.
*31:42.980- 31:45.660* :  The recovery wasn't that bad.
*31:45.940- 31:50.380* :  I gather that you're grateful that the bear emerged alive and well.
*31:50.680- 31:55.380* :  Oh, yeah, you know, I was up there in the bear's world.
*31:55.780- 31:57.120* :  He didn't come to my world.
*31:57.380- 32:01.480* :  But that bear was just doing what a bear does, you know, he's haunting.
*32:01.480- 32:04.620* :  I think I told someone there was no malice, you know,
*32:04.620- 32:09.400* :  any more malice than I would have to a portrait or something, you know.
*32:09.400- 32:13.480* :  What do you think about the fact that bears are more and more
*32:13.480- 32:18.740* :  in close contact with human beings as their habitat is threatened
*32:18.740- 32:21.380* :  and as people encroach more on the wild?
*32:22.060- 32:23.740* :  This is a problem.
*32:24.380- 32:28.360* :  We have issues with black bears here, getting into dumps and get,
*32:28.520- 32:30.380* :  you know, they can become a problem.
*32:30.380- 32:31.820* :  People, they have to get shot.
*32:31.820- 32:34.020* :  But it's always the humans fall.
*32:34.520- 32:35.880* :  You know, they leave trash out.
*32:35.880- 32:38.540* :  They don't clean up their bird feeders.
*32:39.180- 32:42.420* :  We as humans need to regulate our own behavior,
*32:42.820- 32:45.540* :  rather than expect the bears to regulate the bears.
*32:45.940- 32:48.000* :  Matt Dyer speaking to Paul Henley.
*32:50.880- 32:53.220* :  And that's all from us for now.
*32:53.220- 32:56.520* :  But there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*33:31.000- 33:32.440* :  You've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right?
*33:33.380- 33:35.860* :  Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather,
*33:35.860- 33:40.400* :  and there was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world.
*33:41.140- 33:43.480* :  But something happened, not just to him,
*33:44.160- 33:46.080* :  but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood.
