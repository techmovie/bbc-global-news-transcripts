*00:46.980- 00:51.700* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:51.700- 00:54.040* :  prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*00:54.460- 00:57.060* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*00:57.060- 01:00.820* :  honorists to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*01:00.820- 01:02.400* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.

*01:19.160- 01:22.160* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:22.480- 01:27.640* :  I'm Andrew Peach and I'm at 11 o'clock GMT on Sunday, the 25th of August.
*01:28.120- 01:32.540* :  This is a special podcast on the conflict in the Middle East, after exchanges of fire
*01:32.540- 01:34.820* :  between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
*01:35.120- 01:40.560* :  Whether or not there is all that war here is in the hands of Hezbollah and its back or Iran
*01:41.260- 01:43.040* :  and also the government of Israel.
*01:43.240- 01:47.440* :  We'll have analysis of what's happened so far and look at what's expected in the coming hours.
*01:49.600- 01:55.620* :  Also in this podcast, if Hezbollah still has in mind a much bigger attack and feels that
*01:55.680- 01:59.660* :  that is still something it needs to carry out, then we have concerns.
*02:00.400- 02:02.680* :  What impact this could have on the wider region.
*02:05.660- 02:09.140* :  The past few hours have seen a major development in the conflict in the Middle East,
*02:09.140- 02:13.360* :  there's been an intense exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah militants.
*02:13.800- 02:18.540* :  The Israeli military says around 100 fighter jets carried out what it described as a preemptive
*02:18.580- 02:24.140* :  strike on Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon. Hezbollah nevertheless unleashed a barrage of
*02:31.800- 02:35.300* :  attacks against Israel. It said it had fired more than 300 rockets and missiles targeting
*02:35.300- 02:40.020* :  military facilities in northern Israel and that was just the beginning of its response to the
*02:40.020- 02:45.020* :  assassination of one of its commanders last month. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister,
*02:50.820- 02:55.160* :  addressed the nation. This morning we detected Hezbollah's preparations to attack Israel.
*02:55.880- 03:01.120* :  The IDF has since been working vigorously to thwart the threats, destroying thousands of rockets
*03:01.680- 03:06.560* :  and at the north of the country. We are determined to do everything to protect Israel,
*03:06.560- 03:12.200* :  return the residents of the north safely to their homes and continue to uphold a simple rule.
*03:12.840- 03:19.480* :  Whoever hurts us, we hurt him. We hear from Lebanon in a moment. First, I've been talking to
*03:19.480- 03:25.360* :  our correspondent in Jerusalem, John Donerson. This is a significant and ongoing escalation.
*03:25.360- 03:31.620* :  There have been continued Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon and that is the biggest Israeli
*03:31.620- 03:42.780* :  operation against Hezbollah since the 2006 full-scale war. Hezbollah did fire some 320 rockets over
*03:42.780- 03:49.760* :  the border today so far but we have only limited reports of any damage. No reports of any casualties
*03:49.760- 03:56.620* :  here in Israel. In terms of that plan that Israel says Hezbollah had, no way really of us verifying
*03:56.860- 04:03.960* :  any of that. No, I mean we do know from Hezbollah they've put out a statement that their operation
*04:04.000- 04:12.720* :  today was the first phase of a retaliation for the Israeli assassination in Beirut at the end
*04:12.720- 04:18.920* :  of last month of a senior Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukra and they have now said Hezbollah that
*04:18.920- 04:26.160* :  they have stopped for now. So we don't know the scale of the Hezbollah operation that was planned
*04:26.240- 04:33.480* :  but Israel is saying that it took out thousands of rocket launches overnight so previously both
*04:33.480- 04:40.500* :  Israel and Hezbollah have kind of kept their operations fairly limited. There has been daily
*04:40.500- 04:47.180* :  tit for tat fire and retaliation from one side and the other but both sides have said even though
*04:47.180- 04:53.060* :  they are ready for full-scale war they don't want it. You know the region has been waiting for a
*04:53.060- 04:59.100* :  response from Hezbollah for the assassination of that commander last month as well as a response
*04:59.100- 05:05.080* :  from Iran who of course back Hezbollah because you'll remember that the leader of Hamas at the time
*05:05.080- 05:11.860* :  the political leader Ismail Haneer was assassinated presumably by Israel in Tehran also at the end
*05:11.860- 05:16.520* :  of last month and we've been waiting for a response well it hasn't come directly from Iran
*05:16.520- 05:21.880* :  but we have got some sort of response from Hezbollah today. And while this goes on there are
*05:21.880- 05:29.040* :  ceasefire talks taking place in Cairo to try and negotiate a cessation of hostilities in Gaza
*05:29.040- 05:33.960* :  that US keeps making these very optimistic noises about them and yet it's against the backdrop
*05:33.960- 05:39.200* :  of increasing violence in the North. That's right I mean really the United States is the only
*05:39.200- 05:45.880* :  party who has been saying that a deal is close they've been pushing for one for months now and
*05:45.880- 05:50.220* :  Anthony Blinken the US Secretary of State was in the region again this week putting pressure on
*05:50.220- 05:56.180* :  the various parties to try and sign up to a ceasefire and hostage release deal but it doesn't seem
*05:56.180- 06:03.480* :  to be going anywhere and what Mr Blinken said while he was here in Israel a week ago was that it
*06:03.480- 06:10.520* :  was crucial that all parties refrain from any provocative actions that could escalation
*06:10.520- 06:15.380* :  tensions further well that message has clearly not been taken by the players in the region.
*06:15.940- 06:20.860* :  As John Dawnesson in Jerusalem said all eyes are now on Lebanon where Hezbollah says its leader
*06:20.860- 06:25.880* :  Hassan Nasrallah will make a statement later our senior international correspondent Alla
*06:25.880- 06:31.200* :  Gehrin is in southern Lebanon and Tommy Moore. There was an announcement this morning that he would
*06:31.200- 06:37.260* :  be speaking at six o'clock this evening local time at these speeches always come in the form
*06:37.260- 06:43.560* :  of a live transmission from an undisturbed location so nobody will be seeing him in person
*06:44.180- 06:48.940* :  but Hezbollah have already been at pains to point out that as far as they are concerned
*06:49.660- 06:55.800* :  their retaliation or at least the first part of it is over for now and in the statement they
*06:55.800- 07:03.140* :  issued they said that our military operation for today is accomplished and completed. They disputed
*07:03.340- 07:08.660* :  claims from Israel that the preemptive strike had been effective and said these were empty
*07:08.660- 07:13.320* :  claims and that we would hear more about that later from Hassan Nasrallah himself.
*07:14.000- 07:18.900* :  Now I have to say at this stage it is still an open question about how much impact Hezbollah
*07:19.080- 07:26.240* :  has had. Certainly it tried to carry out a very big strike it says it launched 320
*07:26.300- 07:33.060* :  Katusha rockets at Israel and some drones. We don't yet know how many of those actually got
*07:33.060- 07:39.640* :  through. We have not heard of any civilian casualties on the Israeli side. Hezbollah says that
*07:39.640- 07:46.120* :  its targets were 11 military bases and so far on this side in the continuing Israeli
*07:46.120- 07:51.620* :  Air strikes this morning we have heard of three people who have been killed and it seems
*07:51.620- 07:59.960* :  likely that all of those were fighters. So far no reports on civilian deaths on either side
*07:59.960- 08:05.080* :  of the border. I know there's a lot of support among people in southern Lebanon for Hezbollah.
*08:05.080- 08:10.400* :  Where does the Lebanese government sit in all of this though? I mean in a way its position
*08:10.400- 08:16.380* :  is entirely irrelevant because it's not the power in this country. The most powerful organization
*08:16.380- 08:22.820* :  in this country is Hezbollah which is both an Iranian-backed armed group which is a better
*08:22.820- 08:29.280* :  armed than many states and it's also a political organization and in sharp contrast the government
*08:29.280- 08:35.860* :  is divided, dis-united and pretty much paralyzed. There hasn't been a president here sitting
*08:35.860- 08:41.840* :  president for two years. So when you speak to people here about the threat of war and the prospect
*08:41.840- 08:48.900* :  of war you find fear, you find resignation but also what many people say is at the end of the day
*08:48.900- 08:53.500* :  it won't be decided by us and it won't be decided by the Lebanese government or indeed the
*08:53.500- 08:59.320* :  Lebanese army. Whether or not there is all a war here is in the hands of Hezbollah and its
*08:59.320- 09:05.760* :  backer Iran and also the government of Israel. So they will be the decision makers in the end.
*09:06.140- 09:11.400* :  I mean if we were to look at where we are today we've had this very big Israeli preemptive strike.
*09:11.420- 09:18.140* :  We've had Hezbollah saying it has sent 300 rockets and that's where it sits for now. The
*09:18.140- 09:26.280* :  question is will Israel now feel that it has to take a larger military action or will we
*09:26.280- 09:32.020* :  revert to the normal situation along the border for the past 10 months when we have almost daily
*09:32.020- 09:39.020* :  tit-for-tat attacks that are largely focused on military targets? So will Israel take that larger
*09:39.020- 09:44.180* :  military action that all are mentioned? Yossi Mechelberg is an expert in the Middle Eastern North Africa
*09:44.180- 09:48.740* :  from Chatham House. He spoke to my colleague Nikki Shiller and said this clash was expected
*09:49.260- 09:55.960* :  but question whether it can now be contained. Don't think it's finished for now and again we are
*09:55.960- 10:03.920* :  expecting the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Asala to give a speech later today but what Hezbollah said
*10:03.920- 10:10.920* :  this is the end for today and with the emphasis on today it means it's not done. Also from the
*10:10.920- 10:15.320* :  Israeli point of view and there is a school of thought within Israel that actually from the
*10:15.320- 10:20.880* :  beginning of this war back in October the target should have been Hezbollah because it is the
*10:21.300- 10:29.040* :  the more threatening a bigger larger threat to Israel because not only the kind of capabilities
*10:29.040- 10:37.060* :  that it poses the intention also because it's a proxy of Iran. So by by no stretch of the imagination
*10:37.060- 10:43.600* :  this is done and we can expect to see more of that. The question if they can all adhere to the kind
*10:43.600- 10:50.600* :  of parameters of attacking each other without provoking each other to a full-blown war.
*10:51.320- 10:55.260* :  The White House has said President Biden is following events closely and supports
*10:55.260- 11:00.820* :  Israel's right to defend itself while continuing to work for regional stability. America has urged
*11:00.820- 11:06.260* :  Israel and its enemies not to escalate fighting hoping tensions would ease if there was a cease-fire
*11:06.260- 11:11.120* :  deal to try to end the war in Gaza and free hostages. So could all this lead to more
*11:11.120- 11:16.680* :  international pressure for a peace deal? A question for H.A. Helia scholar at the Carnegie Endowment
*11:16.680- 11:23.660* :  for International Peace. I would love to say yes and I think that when it comes to Egypt and
*11:23.660- 11:30.420* :  Qatar on Hamas and other actors on Hamas that that's very true because of course they stand to
*11:30.420- 11:35.500* :  lose the most as well being in the region. I'm afraid what we've seen and I regret to say this
*11:35.500- 11:40.760* :  but I'm afraid what we've seen over the past 10 months is that the United States has been unwilling
*11:40.760- 11:46.560* :  to use the leverage that it has over the Israelis in order to push them to the negotiation table
*11:46.560- 11:52.620* :  in a more effective manner and that the United States has set red lines that the Israelis have
*11:52.620- 11:59.140* :  crossed without consequence and the Israelis know that and it's been very clear over the past 10
*11:59.140- 12:03.660* :  months and you know you just have to look at the Israeli press for all of this information
*12:04.360- 12:10.760* :  right there is really negotiators themselves are leaking to the press saying that Benjamin Netanyahu
*12:10.760- 12:16.300* :  the Israeli Prime Minister is actually sabotaging the negotiations because he doesn't want a
*12:16.300- 12:23.560* :  ceasefire deal at this moment in time and when you have an actor like that an actor that is escalating
*12:23.560- 12:29.980* :  in the West Bank is escalating in Gaza assassinated the lead negotiator of the other side
*12:29.980- 12:34.880* :  then I'm afraid you really need a very strong actor externally in this case the United States
*12:34.880- 12:39.940* :  that is able to say look we have leverage in terms of the United Nations Security Council
*12:39.940- 12:47.740* :  in terms of arms arms deliveries and financial aid you need to take the ceasefire negotiations
*12:47.740- 12:53.020* :  a lot more seriously they have not done that DC has not done the past 10 months and I'm afraid I
*12:53.020- 12:58.700* :  don't expect them to do it in the next few days or weeks. So what might happen next our Middle East
*12:58.700- 13:05.020* :  analyst is Sebastian Usher? Where we are essentially is not that different from where we are I think
*13:05.020- 13:10.380* :  before this happened I mean this is an escalation we've seen them before this is a large number of
*13:10.380- 13:14.840* :  rockets that has bullet has fired into us all we don't yet know what damage they might have done
*13:14.840- 13:20.340* :  what targets they might have hit that is at the moment being held by Israeli censorship but we
*13:20.340- 13:24.260* :  may discover if they have actually hit something they're claiming but they've at least targeted
*13:24.260- 13:30.340* :  serious military targets on the Lebanese side I mean thousands of rockets the Israeli army says
*13:30.340- 13:34.720* :  but it's destroyed of Hasbola Hasbola has a huge arsenal that's not going to dent its ability
*13:35.200- 13:39.780* :  very much but it's a message saying if you're trying to launch a major attack this is what we can do
*13:39.780- 13:44.440* :  then that's something but we haven't had a large number of civilians killed on either side
*13:44.440- 13:51.560* :  no ground incursion so I mean we've been waiting anticipating a major response from Hasbola
*13:52.020- 13:57.080* :  this obviously isn't the end of it but if it's a sign of how far it can go then that's staying
*13:57.080- 14:03.020* :  within the red lines of the conflict between Israel and Hasbola which I think many will see
*14:03.020- 14:09.100* :  with some relief in the region and beyond Iran which is also threatened revenge hasn't joined
*14:09.100- 14:14.080* :  in as at one point there was a belief that maybe Hasbola and Iran would launch an attack together
*14:14.080- 14:19.340* :  which would have been the worst kind of scenario from the perspective of the region kind of going
*14:19.340- 14:24.680* :  to an all out conflict all sides still seem to be trying to avoid that but you know there's always
*14:24.680- 14:31.740* :  a creep that builds with this where each action sets off an action in response if Hasbola still
*14:31.740- 14:37.800* :  has in mind a much bigger attack and feels that that is still something it needs to carry out
*14:38.160- 14:42.940* :  then we have concerns obviously over that in the region if it feels it's made its point to some
*14:42.940- 14:47.800* :  extent and another sort of attack of this nature is planned then I think people will rest a
*14:47.800- 14:51.720* :  little easier today after what's happened. I'm at least analyst Sebastian Usher
*14:53.580- 14:57.140* :  and that's all from us for now there'll be a full edition of Global News to download later
