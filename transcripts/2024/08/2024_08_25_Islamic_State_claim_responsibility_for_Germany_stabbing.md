*01:16.920- 01:19.840* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:21.620- 01:26.180* :  I'm Paul Moss and in the early hours of Sunday, the 25th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:26.300- 01:32.280* :  Islamic State has said the man who carried out a mass stabbing in Germany was one of their soldiers,
*01:32.800- 01:38.640* :  out to avenge the suffering of Muslims in Gaza. Meanwhile in France, police are investigating a
*01:38.640- 01:43.800* :  bomb attack on a synagogue, and Ukraine has marked Independence Day with President Zelensky
*01:43.800- 01:46.200* :  announcing a large prisoner exchange with Russia.
*01:49.180- 01:50.200* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:56.620- 02:01.840* :  why two astronauts stranded in the International Space Station won't be coming back until next year,
*02:02.360- 02:06.400* :  and the TikTok star driving a cucumber shortage in Iceland.
*02:10.320- 02:14.480* :  The City of Zollingen in Western Germany has a long-standing claim to fame.
*02:14.480- 02:19.680* :  For hundreds of years, it's been known as a manufacturing hub for swords and later knives of
*02:19.680- 02:26.380* :  all kinds. It's nicknamed the City of Blades. Well, that now seems horribly ironic, with Zollingen
*02:26.380- 02:33.060* :  the site of a mass stabbing. It happened on Friday evening during celebrations of the city's 650th
*02:33.060- 02:39.120* :  anniversary. A man began stabbing people apparently. At random, three were killed, eight others were
*02:39.120- 02:44.920* :  left seriously injured. Among those attending was Annie Stosberg, a journalist with a local radio station
*02:44.920- 02:54.100* :  RSG. Suddenly the music stopped, and then a man came on stage and he explained that there was a
*02:54.100- 03:03.300* :  stabbing not far away from us, and he said, please don't panic, but go home because we don't
*03:03.300- 03:09.700* :  know where the man is, who the man is. Police in Germany arrested two people, including a 15-year-old
*03:09.700- 03:15.180* :  boy in relation to the attack. Then shortly before recording this podcast, the German authorities
*03:15.180- 03:20.500* :  announced that another suspect had been arrested. The media are reporting that he had it himself
*03:20.500- 03:26.080* :  into a police patrol saying, I am the man you're looking for. Before this, the attack was claimed
*03:26.080- 03:32.360* :  by the Islamic State Group. Unusual, as IS doesn't usually claim responsibility for attacks while
*03:32.360- 03:37.880* :  the perpetrator is alive and at large, and as our jihadist correspondent Mayna Al-Alami explained
*03:37.880- 03:43.160* :  to me, it's unclear what form of involvement with IS the perpetrator is supposed to have had.
*03:43.740- 03:49.040* :  It could be either that they actually orchestrated it, or in most cases with these
*03:50.520- 03:55.740* :  attacks in the West. It's usually that they would be inspired by IS, and the group would then,
*03:56.200- 04:02.160* :  I guess, opportunistically take responsibility for the attack, and they recently put out a message
*04:02.160- 04:08.160* :  saying that even if attackers in the West and other parts of the world, even if they are not
*04:08.160- 04:13.520* :  officially members of the group, they still are in their words one of us because they were
*04:13.520- 04:20.120* :  inspired by us because they have loyalty to us and not to IS into their ideology, so that would make
*04:20.120- 04:29.160* :  them followers of IS. It seems that this attack might be in response to the incitement this year
*04:29.280- 04:35.840* :  that IS repeatedly put out, especially through its leadership messages, calling for revenge attacks
*04:35.840- 04:42.880* :  in the West in response to the Israeli military operation in Gaza. We had seen Islamic
*04:42.880- 04:49.420* :  state as perhaps the first group like that, which was actually taking territory in the Middle East.
*04:50.060- 04:55.620* :  Have they now reverted to the behavior of other terrorist organizations simply trying to carry
*04:55.620- 05:01.100* :  out atrocities against countries they don't like? I mean, definitely gone or the days when IS used
*05:01.340- 05:08.480* :  had held territory in the Middle East and they would fight confront big armies. It has been for
*05:08.480- 05:13.860* :  many years really hidden run attacks, but also even when they did hold territory in the Middle East,
*05:14.100- 05:20.060* :  they still carried out or inspired or directed attacks in the West. So this has been really an
*05:20.060- 05:25.420* :  ongoing thing. It's not that they ever stopped, but such attacks definitely were decreased in recent
*05:25.420- 05:32.540* :  years. But of course, jihadists like IS have found a golden opportunity in the war in Gaza to
*05:32.540- 05:39.020* :  incite, to try to exploit Muslim anger, and a lot of their messages this year have been trying to
*05:39.020- 05:46.820* :  tie any Muslim actions or revenge to the war in Gaza. Mina Al-Alami. So Islamic state have said
*05:46.820- 05:53.120* :  the stabbing in Germany were to avenge Muslims in Gaza, and in France it seems there may also be a
*05:53.120- 05:58.020* :  link between a domestic attack this weekend and the situation in the Middle East. Saturday mornings
*05:58.020- 06:03.920* :  or a car explode outside a synagogue in the southern resort town of La Grande-Motte. It seems to
*06:03.920- 06:09.880* :  have been caused by a gas canister left inside the vehicle and CCTV footage apparently connects
*06:09.880- 06:16.100* :  the blast with a man seen outside draped in a Palestinian flag. A policeman was injured in the
*06:16.100- 06:23.200* :  blast which was witnessed by a local resident, Karam Pakin. I came out of my house and got into my
*06:23.220- 06:27.740* :  car to drive off, and all of a sudden there was a loud noise that I could hear when I was leaving
*06:27.740- 06:33.000* :  my house in the car. Then I saw a lot of vehicles, especially Jean-Darmory and municipal police,
*06:33.000- 06:37.840* :  who arrived very quickly. At the time I didn't understand what had happened because there were
*06:37.860- 06:43.400* :  still traffic jams everywhere. Afterwards I found out exactly what had happened, and it's really
*06:43.400- 06:48.180* :  scary. The French President Emmanuel Macron has described the explosion as terrorism.
*06:48.180- 06:53.400* :  The country's prime minister was certain what was behind it. Gabrielle Attal posted on social
*06:53.400- 06:59.580* :  media that this was an anti-Semitic act targeting what he called out Jewish fellow citizens.
*06:59.580- 07:04.280* :  The BBC's reporter in the region Chris Bachman said the attack could easily have been far more
*07:04.280- 07:11.800* :  devastating. A camster exploded at 8am French time, and that is the winter time when that synagogue
*07:11.800- 07:16.720* :  usually holds services, and in summer it's at 9. So you can imagine if the people had been going
*07:16.720- 07:21.260* :  into that service at 8am, I've seen some of the pictures of the flames that we really would have
*07:21.260- 07:26.320* :  had an absolute tragedy in our hands. The rabbi was in preparing for the service along with four
*07:26.320- 07:31.580* :  of the other people, and they were unharmed. The police officer who was doing his rounds was going
*07:31.580- 07:35.860* :  around there just before and now before the service. He was one who was caught in the blasts
*07:35.860- 07:40.580* :  in hospital and his conditions improving as we speak tonight. There was video cameras as there
*07:40.580- 07:45.460* :  are in front of every synagogue as far as I'm aware in France, and they have caught images of a man
*07:45.460- 07:51.300* :  wearing a Palestinian flag with some sort of fuel in a bottle fleeing the scene, and his face is
*07:51.300- 07:55.600* :  not covered up. So there are 200 officers as I speak to you. The prime minister has announced
*07:55.600- 08:01.240* :  200 police officers are searching for him right now. So an individual suspect perhaps identify,
*08:01.240- 08:07.860* :  but any suggestion of any group or organisation that might be behind this? No, Paul, and you know
*08:07.860- 08:13.120* :  this country is pretty well as well. Any time there's attention in the Middle East is spills over
*08:13.120- 08:17.940* :  especially in France. Why? Because it has the biggest Muslim population in Europe and the
*08:17.940- 08:22.460* :  biggest Jewish population in Europe. So anytime there's conflict or attention in the Middle East,
*08:22.960- 08:28.380* :  if spills over here, it could be one person, it could be an organisation at this point, we just don't
*08:28.380- 08:34.100* :  know. Chris Bachman, and this is a developing story, as we record this podcast, we're hearing reports
*08:34.120- 08:37.900* :  that someone has been arrested in connection with that explosion in Lagront-Mort.
*08:38.700- 08:44.360* :  Now, Ukraine's president Zelensky has been in an unusually pugnacious mood in a speech to mark
*08:44.360- 08:50.540* :  Ukraine's independence day. He called Vladimir Putin a sick man from Red Square who constantly
*08:50.540- 08:56.360* :  threatens everyone with a red button, and Russia he warned will know what retribution is.
*09:03.820- 09:11.760* :  On our land shall find it in his own home, with interest. Whoever seeks to sow evil on our land
*09:11.760- 09:20.420* :  will reap its fruits on his own territory. Mr Zelensky also announced a new prisoner exchange
*09:20.420- 09:26.120* :  to coincide with the celebrations. 115 Ukrainians are now home after being swapped with the same
*09:26.120- 09:32.400* :  number of Russians. Fortid showed the prisoners wrapped in Ukrainian flags, singing the National Anthem.
*09:40.740- 09:45.580* :  The president also announced new legislation banning the activities of religious groups linked
*09:45.580- 09:49.980* :  to Russia, targeting the ties between Russia and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
*09:50.780- 09:54.800* :  Independence Day has become more important to many Ukrainians since the invasion.
*09:55.180- 10:01.520* :  Katarina Bakhina is one of Ukraine's best-known poets. She told us why the date meant so much to her.
*10:02.160- 10:08.720* :  I was only five when Ukraine got the independence, and I was kind of taking it for granted,
*10:09.460- 10:16.760* :  as during all my conscious life Ukraine was an independent state. So I used to make fun of people who
*10:17.040- 10:23.840* :  would say that our fight for the independence is not over, and I thought instead that we only
*10:23.840- 10:30.140* :  have to fight against corruption, we have to work to develop our culture, business, you know,
*10:30.140- 10:36.200* :  to build our country. But I said that I thought that everything was actually set nicely in 1991.
*10:37.080- 10:44.640* :  However, I had to reconsider this. My ex-husband and father of my child is a different
*10:44.700- 10:49.080* :  family. He's been there by choice since the very beginning of the full-scale invasion,
*10:49.300- 10:55.340* :  and we speak every day. And it's an important day for them too, but also it's a usual day.
*10:55.780- 11:03.040* :  His choice is to stay there, either until Ukraine is back in its borders and
*11:03.820- 11:10.060* :  free and safe, or until the end of his life. Everything I'm writing about now has been seen and
*11:10.060- 11:17.120* :  shown through the prism of war. And to be honest, I think that gonna remain even after the war is over
*11:17.120- 11:22.700* :  because that's a life-changing experience, and that's what it does to your mind.
*11:23.300- 11:28.360* :  I only want Ukraine to gain back its border. People get back their safety,
*11:29.140- 11:35.240* :  provide our own policy without any influence or fear from the side of Russia. That's basically all
*11:35.280- 11:43.840* :  we need. I'm not sure Ukraine has no ambitions of an invader. That's not us.
*11:46.800- 11:51.220* :  When it comes to the subject of Israel and Palestine, there's not exactly an overwhelming
*11:51.220- 11:56.940* :  degree of international consensus, but there's one thing you will hear about this contentious issue
*11:56.940- 12:02.160* :  from governments across the Middle East and from the US and countries in Europe. All roughly
*12:02.160- 12:07.800* :  agree that lasting peace in the region will only come if Palestinians have a viable state.
*12:08.740- 12:13.020* :  And yet there are some in the Israeli government who have explicitly said they don't want a
*12:13.020- 12:18.140* :  Palestinian state, and they say they have a way to prevent it. Since the latest war in Gaza
*12:18.140- 12:23.280* :  began, more Israeli settlements have been built in the West Bank, and right wingers in Israel's
*12:23.280- 12:28.240* :  government boast this will make the creation of a Palestinian state impossible. As our Middle East
*12:28.240- 12:44.220* :  correspondent Yalan Nell reports. In this picturesque Palestinian village,
*12:44.720- 12:50.380* :  life carries on as it has for centuries, with its natural spring used to irrigate the ancient
*12:50.380- 12:54.460* :  terraces. It's part of UNESCO World Heritage Site.
*13:03.860- 13:10.240* :  Rasan Olyan is proud of his land, but now part is being taken for a brand new Israeli settlement
*13:10.740- 13:14.000* :  under international law. All settlements are considered illegal.
*13:14.000- 13:21.340* :  They are not caring about the international law or the local law and even the God's law.
*13:21.580- 13:26.700* :  They are stealing our land to build their dreams on our catastrophe.
*13:30.520- 13:36.680* :  Nearby activists join a protest by the Kesea family. Last month, Israeli soldiers forced them
*13:36.680- 13:42.980* :  off their land and settlers moved in. Alice Kesea says far-right minister Bezlil Smotrich,
*13:42.980- 13:48.600* :  who now has broad control over policy here, is tightening Israel's hold on the West Bank.
*13:48.880- 13:53.900* :  They took advantage of the war because all eyes on Gaza. Smotrich established this
*13:54.080- 13:59.440* :  before a few days ago about the new settlement, but we can see in the map that this area,
*13:59.440- 14:04.520* :  it's not included. It's really hard because you're fighting a system.
*14:08.400- 14:14.080* :  Secretly recorded by an Israeli anti-occupation group, Bezlil Smotrich recently laid out
*14:14.080- 14:18.480* :  his bureaucratic steps towards de facto annexation of the West Bank.
*14:21.880- 14:27.380* :  Settlement construction has already been turbocharged. For Israel's religious nationalists,
*14:27.380- 14:34.100* :  the Bible is the Jewish people's deed to this land. And ohad Tal, an MP from Mr. Smotrich's
*14:34.120- 14:40.380* :  party tells us they're fighting against the creation of a Palestinian state. Part of the long-time
*14:40.380- 14:46.160* :  international formula for peace here. The failed policy of giving parts of the land to the Palestinians
*14:46.220- 14:52.640* :  only brought terror and bloodshade to the Palestinians and to Israelis. We've stopped doing that.
*14:52.640- 15:02.980* :  I'm sorry we don't speak English. What are you doing here? We're recording by a settler outpost
*15:02.980- 15:09.440* :  in the World Heritage Site. Our BBC team is stopped by two armed men. One is masked and in a
*15:09.440- 15:15.080* :  military uniform. He speaks English with a British accent. Are you living here or are you in the army?
*15:16.160- 15:24.420* :  No comment. I don't know. I'll call my superior to see what we're doing with it.
*15:24.660- 15:28.360* :  I'll have my ID back. In a minute. They ordered us to leave.
*15:30.900- 15:36.480* :  UNESCO says it's concerned by the settler's plans around Beteer. But for Palestinians,
*15:36.480- 15:42.540* :  this is not just about preserving an historic site. It's about keeping hope for the future.
*15:44.560- 15:45.260* :  Yelann Nell.

*17:30.140- 17:34.600* :  It's nearly three weeks since the Bangladeshi Prime Minister was ousted by student protests.
*17:34.620- 17:41.420* :  More than 450 people died in the unrest, many shot dead by police. And now, a team from the
*17:41.420- 17:46.780* :  United Nations is assessing whether this constitutes a violation of human rights which needs to be
*17:46.780- 17:52.220* :  investigated. Many of the students who took part in the demonstrations were women. The BBC's
*17:52.220- 17:54.600* :  Akbar Hossein has been speaking to some of them.
*17:59.540- 18:05.640* :  It's pouring rain in this leafy and quite neighbour-hurintaka. The Ahmad family is still in
*18:05.640- 18:11.600* :  awe of what they have been able to achieve. They removed a leader who ruled the country with an
*18:11.600- 18:19.360* :  iron grip. And it's the young, digital generation that led the way. Even when the internet went dark,
*18:20.200- 18:23.320* :  you kind of understood that the internet would go away because there were many signs.
*18:23.320- 18:28.620* :  So it kind of formed a chain through which we passed on information to each other so that we were
*18:28.620- 18:33.500* :  always aware of what was going on. Rida Ma and her friends were chased and attacked,
*18:33.500- 18:40.180* :  but they kept going back to the streets. And instead of holding her back, her mother Saima
*18:40.180- 18:48.720* :  joined them. When we saw that many kids were actually tortured, there were bullets on them. Every
*18:48.720- 18:54.720* :  kid sees our kids, that's a mother's instinct. So we thought that if we want to protect our kids,
*18:54.720- 19:01.540* :  if we want to see future of our kids, we have to protest and we have to allow our kids to be
*19:01.540- 19:07.180* :  there. Even though women in Bangladesh have been at the forefront of protest movements for generations,
*19:08.140- 19:18.100* :  this time things are different. Students are chased by the police. I met Farzana Liu,
*19:18.100- 19:24.600* :  a single mother and professional bodybuilder at her local gym. No force can stop a revolution,
*19:24.600- 19:31.340* :  she says, when mothers join their children in their fight. But this change has come at a price.
*19:32.180- 19:40.100* :  I saw a helicopter really close to the ground and at one point, me and my sister both got shot.
*19:40.960- 19:47.880* :  This is 19-year-old Mumtahina. She and her cousin sister, I saw a shot in their bedroom of their
*19:47.880- 19:54.500* :  ninth floor department. The bullet came through the balcony. The family believes from a police
*19:54.500- 20:01.680* :  helicopter. I cannot stand. I cannot walk. I have no idea how long it will take to heal myself
*20:01.680- 20:05.640* :  completely. It is going to affect me probably for the rest of my life.
*20:05.900- 20:12.220* :  The Hassanah government issued a statement at the time rejecting all claims of people being shot
*20:12.220- 20:19.600* :  from helicopters. In Uttara, north of the capital Dhaka, doctors risked arrest to come forward
*20:19.600- 20:26.800* :  and help. Major Hafiz Islam, a former army doctor, said that he had never faced so many
*20:26.800- 20:33.560* :  casualties with bullet injuries. I can mention a student here, my last one is school, secondary school.
*20:33.560- 20:40.280* :  She got a bullet injury, direct to her head. It's been a few days and life is almost back to
*20:40.280- 20:45.740* :  normal in Dhaka. But students are still out on the streets, calling for democracy, religious,
*20:45.740- 20:51.760* :  Germany and justice. A message to those who are in charge and politicians who will come to power
*20:51.760- 20:58.320* :  in future. We have achieved a new Bangladesh and we have to reform it in our way as our
*20:58.780- 21:04.580* :  generation has achieved it. We are the upcoming generation to reform this country in another way,
*21:04.580- 21:10.720* :  to take this country in another way. Now the movement is about justice. The women and men of
*21:10.740- 21:16.880* :  Bangladesh know the price of the page to achieve this victory and they won't let go easily.
*21:18.180- 21:23.580* :  On the one hand we now have what I suppose we could call a good news story, 20 medical students
*21:23.580- 21:28.800* :  who were kidnapped in Nigeria who have been rescued. Police there congratulated themselves for what
*21:28.800- 21:34.420* :  they said was a professional job carried out by a special tactical squad which was dispatched
*21:34.420- 21:39.000* :  to the central state of Benou, where the students were snatched. But on the other hand,
*21:39.000- 21:43.660* :  this is just one incident in what seems to be an epidemic of kidnapping in Nigeria,
*21:43.660- 21:49.500* :  with literally thousands now taking place every year. Our correspondent, Richard Cagoy told me
*21:49.500- 21:55.740* :  how this one began. A group of students about 20 of them were traveling from the northern parts
*21:55.740- 22:01.240* :  of Nigeria. So they were heading to a southern state called Enugu and the purpose for these,
*22:01.240- 22:06.620* :  they were just basically going for an annual medical student's convention. So while they were in
*22:06.620- 22:13.320* :  the North Central's state of Benou, they were ambushed by armed gunmen. So they were at this
*22:13.320- 22:18.480* :  particular stretch of road that's really notorious for kidnapping. So that's all we know is that
*22:18.480- 22:23.060* :  they were ambushed and then they were taken captive and they were being held in a nearby forest.
*22:23.760- 22:29.680* :  So how did the police then manage to locate them? So details in terms of how the security
*22:29.680- 22:35.780* :  forces managed to secure their release, it's not very clear because when that question was put
*22:35.780- 22:41.780* :  to the police spokesperson, what he said is that their release was done tactfully and in a very
*22:41.780- 22:47.840* :  professional manner. That's all he said. They're insisting that no ransom was paid, excuse my
*22:47.840- 22:53.500* :  cynicism, but the authorities always want to say that in kidnapping situations. Are we sure that
*22:53.500- 22:58.980* :  no money was handed over in this case? I mean, that's the million dollar question, but the police
*22:58.980- 23:04.520* :  have been very adamant that no money was exchanged to secure the release of these students.
*23:04.520- 23:10.740* :  In Nigeria, payment of ransom is illegal. But what we have seen is that among families of people
*23:10.740- 23:15.580* :  who have been kidnapped, they become very desperate and to certain extent they've gone to
*23:16.060- 23:22.400* :  lengths of doing crowdfunding even on social media because the gunmen were demanding 32,000
*23:22.400- 23:28.220* :  US dollars or 5 million Naira to release the students by the Catholic bishops of Nigeria,
*23:28.260- 23:33.180* :  urged the members of the public to put a pause to the contributions as they consulted with
*23:33.180- 23:37.720* :  the security forces. There are reports that thousands of people are now kidnapped every year in
*23:37.720- 23:43.580* :  Nigeria. Why has this crime got so out of hand? Poverty has been a big factor in this case. The
*23:43.580- 23:49.460* :  Nigerian economy hasn't been doing very well and the youth unemployment is very high. And so,
*23:49.460- 23:54.420* :  what we've been seeing, especially in the northern eastern parts of Nigeria, which are border, you know,
*23:54.420- 24:01.400* :  Niger, Cameroon and Chad have got porous borders. And so a lot of people who are involved in this
*24:01.400- 24:05.940* :  practice, you know, it's just basically a criminal syndicate. So for them, it's an easy way of
*24:05.940- 24:10.860* :  making money. And so that's part of the reason why we're seeing the surge in the cases of
*24:10.860- 24:17.420* :  kidnappings in Nigeria. Our Africa regional editor, Richard Kugoy. Here in Britain and across much
*24:17.420- 24:22.200* :  of the northern hemisphere, we're approaching the end of summer. People who went away for the holidays
*24:22.200- 24:28.380* :  are preparing to come home, children back to school, parents perhaps back to work. But there's one
*24:28.380- 24:33.100* :  man and woman who said off on a trip at the start of summer who it seems won't be getting back
*24:33.100- 24:39.040* :  for some time. Yes, it's those astronauts, Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who went on what
*24:39.040- 24:44.300* :  was supposed to be an eight-day trip to the International Space Station back in June. They've
*24:44.300- 24:49.840* :  been told they can't be returned until February next year. That's because there were problems with
*24:49.840- 24:55.300* :  their Boeing spacecraft on the journey out. And as Bill Nelson from NASA explained, they don't want
*24:55.300- 25:05.240* :  to risk bringing the astronauts back on it. Space flight is risky, even at its safest and even at
*25:05.240- 25:11.740* :  its most routine. And so the decision to keep butch and sunny aboard the International Space Station
*25:12.180- 25:20.500* :  and bring the border on her home uncrewed is a result of a commitment to safety. Our core value
*25:20.500- 25:27.720* :  is safety and it is our north star. NASA's safety first approach still leaves open the question
*25:28.260- 25:33.100* :  why it's going to take so long to get another rocket up to bring the stranded astronauts home.
*25:33.100- 25:38.560* :  Our science editor Rebecca Morrell had an explanation. This is basically because of complicated
*25:38.560- 25:44.880* :  scheduling on the International Space Station. So the SpaceX spacecraft has to be launched in September.
*25:45.600- 25:50.060* :  It's going to go up there with just two astronauts on board. It's supposed to be carrying four,
*25:50.060- 25:54.840* :  but two of them are going to stay at home. It's going to do its stint on the space station and
*25:54.840- 25:59.780* :  it's scheduled to return in February next year. So it's got the space for butch and sunny to come home
*25:59.860- 26:05.460* :  and it doesn't disrupt the scheduling by having them come home at that planned date. But yeah,
*26:05.460- 26:10.780* :  it's a long time. I think people have got used to the idea that space travel is now relatively routine
*26:10.780- 26:15.500* :  that rockets just go off and come home and they may be hearing you and thinking, well, why can't
*26:15.500- 26:19.340* :  they send one of the spare ones up there to pick them up and take them back? I mean, it's not far away
*26:19.340- 26:24.140* :  the space station. It's not like going to the moon or something like that. It's just a bit above the
*26:24.140- 26:29.720* :  earth. Yeah, I mean, this is something sort of NASA didn't fully anticipate, I guess, because you know,
*26:29.720- 26:35.640* :  the astronauts went up on a Boeing Starliner spacecraft, but that it suffered some malfunctions.
*26:35.640- 26:40.200* :  It was its test flight. You know, it's thrusters weren't working properly. It had a few helium leaks.
*26:40.720- 26:45.120* :  So NASA has been trying to work out whether that could take the astronauts safely home and they've
*26:45.120- 26:49.620* :  deemed that the risk is just too high. But the astronauts always knew because it's a test flight
*26:49.620- 26:54.940* :  that things can go wrong. I said we've got used to the idea of space flight as being almost routine.
*26:54.940- 27:01.280* :  Has this incident dented that very straightforward approach to space travel that I think a lot of us
*27:01.280- 27:06.540* :  had got used to? NASA's been very open about the problems that the spacecraft has faced.
*27:07.080- 27:11.300* :  And that's partly because of the issues they had with the space shuttle program. And of course,
*27:11.300- 27:17.500* :  the two disasters where astronauts were killed on board their spacecraft. So NASA has been very
*27:17.500- 27:23.220* :  open about discussing the challenges and the problems and the risks involved. And it's been
*27:23.220- 27:27.460* :  quite an interesting process to see them kind of work through these problems and come to this
*27:27.460- 27:31.320* :  quite difficult decision. You know, they wanted the astronauts to come back on the Boeing
*27:31.320- 27:36.000* :  spacecraft. Space isn't straightforward. The two astronauts insist they're perfectly happy
*27:36.000- 27:41.520* :  being up there. But I guess some of us may wonder whether they're putting on a brave face or maybe
*27:41.520- 27:46.520* :  being told to put on a brave face by NASA. I mean, it's quite something to set off for an 8-day trip
*27:46.700- 27:50.020* :  and not get back for. I think it's going to be more than eight months. I know I think of the birthdays
*27:50.020- 27:54.780* :  you missed. The Christmas is, I mean, I would not be happy to have to be told I'm going to be
*27:54.780- 27:58.800* :  somewhere for eight days and then it lasts a lot longer. But then I'm not an astronaut. I'm a mere
*27:58.800- 28:04.060* :  science editor. You know, this is what these guys do. They love being on the International Space Station.
*28:04.080- 28:08.620* :  They're both veteran astronauts. They've both had long duration missions before. So, you know,
*28:08.660- 28:12.380* :  they say they're happy. And I have to say they look pretty happy in all the imagery coming back
*28:12.380- 28:16.640* :  from the space station. Crucial question though. Do you know if they get paid overtime?
*28:17.160- 28:20.920* :  Oh, I don't know. I don't know if they get time off in lieu. Maybe they get to have like a long,
*28:20.920- 28:27.120* :  a long break at the end when they when they come home. Rebecca Morale. Now, whether or not you
*28:27.120- 28:32.240* :  like cucumbers, they're not usually a food item that allows his strong feelings. And yet,
*28:32.240- 28:37.100* :  supermarkets in Iceland have seen an unprecedented surge in demand for cucumbers,
*28:37.900- 28:43.880* :  suppliers struggling to keep up. And the cause? Well, it's apparently a recipe that went viral,
*28:43.880- 28:48.320* :  as Stephanie's Accreson has been finding out. Sometimes you need to eat an entire cucumber.
*28:48.320- 28:50.900* :  Let me show you the best way to do it. Start by slicing your entire cucumber.
*28:50.940- 28:56.760* :  That's the TikTok creator who might explain why so many supermarket shelves in Iceland aren't
*28:56.760- 29:04.140* :  short on cucumbers. In numerous videos, Logan Moffat, a 23-year-old from Ottawa in Canada, shares his
*29:04.140- 29:09.880* :  favourite ways to eat the crunch of vegetable. Sometimes with some perhaps unexpected flavour
*29:09.880- 29:15.760* :  pairings like cream cheese and slices of salmon or one with peanut butter and strawberry jam.
*29:16.600- 29:21.380* :  But the one that appears to have gripped uses in Iceland includes sesame oil, soy sauce and rice
*29:21.380- 29:28.040* :  vinegar, called sushi cucumber. That video has more than 19 million views and has been picked up by some
*29:28.040- 29:33.640* :  Icelandic food bloggers too. The supermarket chain, to all known, says it has seen a three-fold
*29:33.640- 29:39.300* :  increase in sales of some of the ingredients with both cucumber and sesame oil selling out in
*29:39.300- 29:46.800* :  several stores. Roon and Christmas and is the company's marketing expert. We follow social media
*29:46.800- 29:51.940* :  very closely and try to catch the trends online. So we look at the products that are becoming
*29:51.940- 29:57.040* :  popular to decide whether we should buy more of them for our stores. It's not the first time
*29:57.060- 30:02.900* :  shortages of food products have been attributed to viral trends. In Norway, customers recently had
*30:02.900- 30:09.300* :  problems finding popcorn kernels after lots of people used them to grow popcorn grass. In 2019,
*30:09.300- 30:15.720* :  a viral baked feta pasta by a finished food blogger caused an increase in the cheese sales globally.
*30:16.440- 30:21.600* :  But some experts have played down the viral videos association with the latest shortages.
*30:22.180- 30:27.300* :  The Icelandic farming association said many cucumber farmers replace their plants at this time of
*30:27.300- 30:33.920* :  year, often leading to lower supplies of the vegetable. They say the situation is expected to be temporary.
*30:34.480- 30:40.340* :  So perhaps those craving a crunchy salad might just have to say cool as a cucumber.
*30:41.000- 30:43.840* :  Stephanie's Acrosan, and if you want to see what all the fuss is about,

*30:55.100- 31:02.540* :  in life and in death. Saturday saw Alan DeLond, buried at his home in the village of Dushi, 135 km
*31:02.540- 31:08.080* :  southeast of Paris. There were just 50 close friends and relatives attending. But with so many
*31:08.080- 31:13.420* :  members of the public showing up, police had to impose roadblocks near the venue and they closed
*31:13.420- 31:19.300* :  the airspace above it. Mr DeLond was, to be fair, one of the foremost European actors in the
*31:19.360- 31:22.180* :  1960s and later, Sophie Smith reports.
*31:28.440- 31:32.960* :  Hundreds of fans stood outside the gates of Alan DeLond's manor house to pay their respects
*31:32.960- 31:38.560* :  to him and his family. The gates were covered with flowers as the late actors admire as waited
*31:38.560- 31:43.840* :  for his funeral husk to arrive. His sons Anthony and Alan came out to greet them.
*31:49.660- 31:56.380* :  Alan DeLond died last Sunday aged 88 after a 70-year career, both on and off the screen.
*31:57.100- 32:01.440* :  Famed for his good looks and acting roles, he was also a producer and singer.
*32:01.440- 32:07.160* :  He was laid to rest in his garden near his beloved dogs, although the family did not fulfill his
*32:07.160- 32:12.640* :  wish for his 10-year-old Belgian malinois to be killed and buried with him. His fans held
*32:12.640- 32:18.000* :  DeLond records as they sang one of his most famous songs for hold-by-hold with the French Italian
