*01:28.520- 01:32.240* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:33.420- 01:37.400* :  I'm Jackie Leonard, and in the early hours of Thursday, the 22nd of August,
*01:37.400- 01:43.500* :  these are our main stories. Hezbollah is reported to fired more than 100 rockets from Lebanon
*01:43.500- 01:50.420* :  into Israel in a single day, as hopes fade that US ceasefire efforts will succeed. A study has
*01:50.420- 01:56.660* :  found that Brazil has lost a third of its natural areas since records began, and for the first
*01:56.660- 02:02.180* :  time, Ukraine has confirmed it's been using American rocket systems during its offensive across
*02:02.180- 02:06.740* :  the Russian border. Also in this podcast,
*02:11.140- 02:17.640* :  coming to a Games console near you soon will hear about the huge Gamescom event in Germany showcasing
*02:17.640- 02:28.480* :  the next big thing in the gaming industry. Hopes for a Gaza ceasefire, and with it, a calming of
*02:28.480- 02:34.880* :  Middle East tensions are fading. Wednesday saw a heavy exchange of fire across the border between
*02:34.880- 02:39.880* :  the Israeli military and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Meanwhile, the Palestinian movement Fata
*02:39.880- 02:45.740* :  is accusing Israel of trying to ignite a regional war with the killing in Lebanon of one of its
*02:45.740- 02:52.680* :  senior officials, Khalil Al-Maktah. Israel has claimed he worked with Iran's revolutionary guards
*02:52.680- 02:59.340* :  and was smuggling weapons and funds into the occupied West Bank. David Mensa is a spokesman
*02:59.360- 03:05.380* :  for the Israeli government. The idea for this morning released a precise breakdown of exactly
*03:05.420- 03:10.680* :  who this man was, working in partnership with the Iranians Islamic Revolutionary Guard,
*03:10.780- 03:18.120* :  trying to push deadly arms into the Duderian Samaria, working with Hezbollah. We've produced
*03:18.140- 03:27.240* :  a comprehensive list of his crimes and why we targeted him and why we successfully targeted him.
*03:27.980- 03:33.560* :  Our correspondent in Beirut is Hugo Bachega. It was a particularly violent day along the border
*03:33.560- 03:39.300* :  with attacks and counterattacks between Hezbollah and Israel. So Hezbollah carried out a number of
*03:39.300- 03:46.080* :  attacks, including two significant attacks with drones and the other one with rockets targeting
*03:46.080- 03:52.320* :  Israeli military positions. And they say that this was in response to an Israeli attack that happened
*03:52.320- 03:57.520* :  overnight targeting a weapons depot in the Bekhar valley in the east of the country,
*03:57.520- 04:02.540* :  deep inside Lebanon's territory. And this was the second night in a row that a weapons
*04:02.540- 04:07.920* :  facility used by Hezbollah was attacked by the Israeli military. So it's very interesting that
*04:07.920- 04:12.440* :  what the Israelis are saying, the defense minister you have got learned to say that this is part
*04:12.440- 04:18.420* :  of the Israeli strategy that this is in preparation for what may come next. In other words, the Israelis
*04:18.900- 04:25.100* :  seem to be laying the groundwork for the possibility of a bigger campaign against Hezbollah
*04:25.480- 04:31.060* :  here in Lebanon because they say that the situation is unsustainable with these attacks that
*04:31.060- 04:35.820* :  have been happening almost every day. And the fear here in Lebanon is that this country could be
*04:36.240- 04:41.460* :  dragged into another war with Israel that could have catastrophic consequences for Lebanon.
*04:41.900- 04:47.060* :  And certainly the Palestinian movement Fata is saying that the killing by Israel of one of its
*04:47.060- 04:54.320* :  senior commanders in Lebanon is an attempt to escalate into a regional war.
*04:54.860- 04:58.800* :  Yeah, I mean, we really don't know whether the Israelis were targeting this man,
*04:58.900- 05:05.680* :  Khalil Al-Makda, because of his links to Fata. I was left with the impression that the Israeli
*05:05.680- 05:11.740* :  military tried to describe him as a relatively high profile figure and that he was targeted not
*05:11.740- 05:17.260* :  because of his Fata affiliation. There was a long statement from the Israeli military giving
*05:17.260- 05:22.940* :  details of the accusations against him. They said he was a man who operated on behalf of
*05:23.240- 05:28.700* :  Iran's revolutionary guard corps that he and his brother were involved in directing attacks
*05:28.700- 05:34.420* :  and smuggling weapons and funds into the West Bank. So in other words, it seems that he was
*05:34.420- 05:40.140* :  targeted for the things he had done rather than because of the links he had with Fata.
*05:40.660- 05:45.260* :  But again, it was a very strong reaction from this Fata official saying that the Israelis
*05:45.740- 05:50.500* :  essentially trying to ignite a regional war with this assassination, but difficult to say whether
*05:50.500- 05:55.220* :  this is going to have any kind of significant impact. And of course, there has been an intense
*05:55.220- 06:02.760* :  round of diplomacy aimed at calming tensions aimed at getting a ceasefire in Gaza and the release
*06:02.760- 06:08.480* :  of the hostages there. And yet it all seems as tense as ever. Yeah, I think there's almost
*06:08.540- 06:15.840* :  no expectation that these efforts are going to result in a deal from the reaction that we are
*06:16.000- 06:23.280* :  hearing from Israeli officials, from the position of Hamas who have essentially rejected
*06:23.280- 06:29.800* :  the terms of what has been presented. And obviously, this ceasefire and hostage release deal was
*06:29.800- 06:36.340* :  the main hope to try to de-escalate tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border because here in
*06:36.340- 06:41.760* :  Lebanon, Hezbollah has been saying that they will observe here in Lebanon, any kind of pause
*06:42.360- 06:49.060* :  in the fighting in Gaza. But it feels like we're not close to any kind of pause in the fighting in
*06:49.060- 06:56.200* :  Gaza. Hugo Bachega in Lebanon. A new study has shown that Brazil has lost more than a third of
*06:56.200- 07:02.860* :  its natural areas since records began. Data published by the Monitoring Network Map BOMAS
*07:03.340- 07:08.020* :  reveals that the Amazon rainforest has been hit hardest, Clityasala reports.
*07:08.860- 07:13.820* :  Brazil's Amazon rainforest now has just over half a million square kilometers of native
*07:14.640- 07:20.340* :  vegetation. The Cerrado, the world's most biodiverse savanna in central Brazil, ranks second
*07:20.340- 07:25.780* :  in vegetation loss while the pantanal, a vast wetland has seen a significant reduction in its
*07:25.780- 07:31.360* :  water bodies. The loss of natural habitats has largely been driven by a massive increase in
*07:31.360- 07:36.860* :  land use for livestock and farming. Map BOMAS says this will likely lead to more extreme weather
*07:36.860- 07:42.360* :  events in the region. Scientists warn Brazil is dangerously close to the point where it won't be
*07:42.360- 07:47.320* :  possible to restore its natural habitats by planting new trees. Clityasala
*07:48.100- 07:53.040* :  The former US President Donald Trump has addressed supporters from behind bulletproof glass
*07:53.040- 07:58.940* :  for his first outdoor rally since surviving an assassination attempt last month. Speaking in
*07:58.940- 08:04.460* :  North Carolina he said without evidence that hundreds of thousands of murderers had been sent to
*08:04.460- 08:09.880* :  the United States from countries such as Venezuela which he claimed was now safer than America.
*08:10.600- 08:17.300* :  Mr. Trump also claimed he could restore world peace. Starting the moment I lift my hand from the
*08:17.300- 08:24.340* :  Bible after taking the oath of office I will move to restore America to maximum strength and return
*08:25.180- 08:28.420* :  the world to peace. We're going to return the world to peace.
*08:32.960- 08:37.220* :  And mostly I can do it with a telephone call. You know we're not decent troops I can do it with
*08:37.220- 08:43.320* :  a telephone call. He was speaking as the Democratic Party holds its convention in Chicago as we
*08:43.320- 08:48.940* :  record this podcast. A number of prominent Democrats are due to speak on day three of the gathering.
*08:48.940- 08:54.380* :  Tim Waltz is expected to deliver the keynote address as he officially accepts the vice
*08:54.380- 09:02.400* :  presidential nomination. Ukraine's military says it's been using the US-made high-mars rocket system
*09:02.400- 09:07.980* :  during its incursion into Russia. This marks the first time that Ukraine has officially confirmed
*09:07.980- 09:13.640* :  that donated equipment from the West has been deployed across the border. Our Europe regional
*09:13.640- 09:19.620* :  editor Paul Moss has more details. It's hardly a shock revelation. Ever since Ukrainian
*09:19.620- 09:25.100* :  troops crossed into Russia there's been evidence that equipment donated by the West was playing a
*09:25.100- 09:31.200* :  role. But Ukraine's military is now openly celebrating its use of American rockets to destroy
*09:31.200- 09:37.960* :  Russian bridges which suggest they don't expect the US to complain. And Ukraine's allies do appear
*09:37.960- 09:43.460* :  relaxed about where their kit is deployed, providing it doesn't strike targets deep inside
*09:43.460- 09:49.220* :  Russian territory. The Kremlin, however, has said that the use of Western weapons on Russian soil
*09:49.220- 09:56.260* :  does mark an escalation. That was Paul Moss. Officials on the Italian island of Sicily say they
*09:56.260- 10:01.420* :  found the bodies of five passengers from a super yacht that sank in extreme weather conditions on
*10:01.420- 10:07.600* :  Monday. The British technology tycoon Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter were among six
*10:07.600- 10:13.000* :  people who weren't missing when the vessel named the Bayesian went down. Our southern Europe
*10:13.000- 10:18.340* :  correspondent Mark Lowen spent the day in Porticello where the search operations taking place.
*10:19.040- 10:25.220* :  In this awful story another grimly inevitable chapter, the bodies of five of the six missing
*10:25.220- 10:30.840* :  passengers from the Bayesian were finally found today all but one brought to shore. Their identities
*10:30.840- 10:35.700* :  have not been officially confirmed. Along with the yacht's chef whose body was found earlier,
*10:36.020- 10:40.220* :  six people are now known to have died when the luxury super yacht went down before dawn on
*10:40.220- 10:46.700* :  Monday after a water spout, a mini tornado hit it, capsizing it within minutes. Divers have been
*10:46.700- 10:52.180* :  using remote control vehicles to patrol the seabed for hours, far longer than they themselves can
*10:52.180- 11:01.260* :  spend down there at such depths. It's left even the experts dumbfounded. We went out to see with one
*11:01.260- 11:06.380* :  of Sicily's top ships of heirs that he knocked acilli on his sailing yacht about a third of
*11:06.380- 11:11.960* :  the size of the Bayesian. He's been in the business for 30 years and says for a huge super yacht to
*11:11.960- 11:18.220* :  have sunk so quickly there must have been serious errors. For that amount of water to have flooded in,
*11:18.220- 11:24.140* :  it couldn't have been one single mistake. It must have been many. Perhaps a large compartment was
*11:24.140- 11:29.320* :  left open for a long time. We had a weather warning beforehand so there should have been two crew
*11:29.320- 11:34.660* :  taking turns on overnight watch and it should have been moored in the harbor. And so as the
*11:34.660- 11:40.560* :  rescuers find more missing, the investigators search for more answers. It is a time consuming and
*11:40.560- 11:48.520* :  agonizing weight for both. Mark Lohan in Sicily. It's summer in the Danish capital Copenhagen and
*11:48.520- 11:54.240* :  when better to prepare to protect the city from the future dangers of extreme weather, which
*11:54.240- 11:59.220* :  have forecast to become more frequent with climate change. Hundreds of projects are in the works to
*11:59.220- 12:04.920* :  carry away heavy rainfall. And our reporter in Copenhagen, Adrian Murray, has been taking a closer
*12:04.920- 12:12.880* :  lock. Climbing down into a giant hole 20 meters below ground, we reach the entrance of a huge
*12:12.880- 12:19.400* :  tunnel burying right under the city. It's part of a plan to protect Copenhagen from flooding
*12:19.400- 12:25.920* :  and from severe rainfall. Matthew Mogritch, a construction manager from Utility Firm Hoffle,
*12:26.340- 12:31.260* :  leads the way inside. This is like Jules Wern, journey to the center of the earth.
*12:31.880- 12:37.820* :  Acting as a man-made river, this underground tunnel network will hold large volumes of water,
*12:38.300- 12:43.620* :  then carried away to the sea. This one we're understanding to the harbor, it's 700 meters long
*12:43.960- 12:50.180* :  and the two tunnels together should retain 10,000 cubic meters of water during a storm event.
*12:56.560- 13:02.820* :  In 2011, a once in a thousand year flood caused by a cloud burst left the Danish capital
*13:02.820- 13:08.480* :  knee deep in water, to prevent future damage, more than two billion dollars is being spent,
*13:08.520- 13:13.560* :  flood proofing the city. It's very expensive to protect the city, but you could say it's even
*13:13.560- 13:19.420* :  more expensive not to. Brian Hansen is Hoffle's chief operating officer for water and wastewater.
*13:20.100- 13:25.800* :  In 50 or 100 years time, we will probably in Copenhagen see some 40 or 50 percent more rain
*13:25.880- 13:31.620* :  in a year. It's about these extreme events where all of a sudden we have a lot of heavy rain
*13:31.620- 13:36.220* :  in a very short period of time and they just become more frequent with the climate change.
*13:37.560- 13:40.720* :  In cities built up with impervious tarmac and concrete,
*13:41.220- 13:46.100* :  rainwater has nowhere to go and so many cities have been hit by flush floods.
*13:46.840- 13:52.280* :  Worldwide, it's estimated that economic losses top 100 billion dollars each year,
*13:52.840- 13:57.100* :  and within the next three decades, that sum is expected to climb steeply,
*13:57.440- 14:03.940* :  a severe weather event occur more frequently. Yet many cities remain under-prepared.
*14:04.960- 14:11.560* :  With more than 300 climate adaptation projects in the works, Copenhagen is remodeling itself.
*14:12.500- 14:17.180* :  At the centre of this built up residential area was once a congested roundabout,
*14:17.760- 14:22.860* :  but hundreds of trees have now been planted, transforming it into a small woodland.
*14:23.920- 14:30.980* :  Creating green spaces like this one that can act as a sponge help urban areas handle heavy
*14:30.980- 14:37.640* :  dampers of rain. Meanwhile, in the west of the city, what looks like an ordinary leafy park
*14:37.640- 14:44.760* :  has a cover hidden purpose. There are small lakes and under the rose garden is water storage,
*14:44.760- 14:50.660* :  while the foot-high walls that wrap around the park can be sealed off, transforming this
*14:50.660- 14:57.140* :  recreational space into an urban reservoir. Jan Rasmussen, who's the municipality's climate
*14:57.940- 15:02.700* :  adaptation project manager, shows me around. It can fill the whole park up, actually holding
*15:02.700- 15:09.200* :  back more than 20,000 cubic meters of water. Even the sports pitches here are some kind of
*15:09.520- 15:15.620* :  selecting double as large ponds, storing water and helping to protect the nearby neighbourhood.
*15:15.620- 15:23.680* :  But low-lying Copenhagen also has other risks to prepare for, like storm surges and extreme heat.
*15:24.220- 15:29.460* :  Changing climate, we will have raising sea level, we will have more heat waves in the summertime,
*15:29.460- 15:32.420* :  and we can make the sea the more green, have more trees in the city.
*15:32.940- 15:38.080* :  With more extreme weather expected in the decades ahead, amplified by climate change,
*15:38.100- 15:45.240* :  Denmark's capital is getting ready and other cities are following the plans closely and taking note.
*15:46.560- 15:47.880* :  Adrian Murray in Denmark
*15:51.100- 15:56.600* :  Still to come. Today for trauma care, the best standard of care is what we call in Brooklyn
*15:56.600- 16:02.900* :  pressure and appraire. Now a new treatment derived from algae that it's hoped could be a game-changer
*16:03.140- 16:04.760* :  in stopping catastrophic bleeding.

*17:16.140- 17:21.380* :  The UN says, for the first time in four months, an aid convoy has entered Sudan from Chad
*17:21.380- 17:26.520* :  to bring desperately needed food to people at risk of famine in the Darfur region.
*17:27.160- 17:33.240* :  More than a dozen trucks crossed the border at Adre, a week after Sudan's military-led
*17:33.240- 17:37.620* :  government agreed to let them in. The army had kept the border closed,
*17:37.620- 17:44.080* :  in what it said was an effort to stop weapons reaching the rival paramilitary rapid support forces.
*17:44.820- 17:49.960* :  More than 10 million people have been displaced since the war began in April last year.
*17:50.680- 17:57.180* :  The U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan is Tom Periello. Seeing those trucks was a really good start,
*17:57.180- 18:01.560* :  but we've already seen some of those who've tried to use starvation as a weapon of war,
*18:01.560- 18:07.360* :  putting back in all the breaks. We need to see President Burhan continue to exert that clear message
*18:07.360- 18:12.080* :  that these are just the beginning. We've got 100 trucks already ready. They need to be moving
*18:12.080- 18:18.860* :  not just through Adre, but also on the Dava road and other mechanisms to get to over 20 million
*18:18.860- 18:23.400* :  people who face acute shortage and even starvation got to be moving quickly.
*18:24.080- 18:30.280* :  Eric Reeves is the chairman of the Darfur Bar Association, which was founded in the mid-1990s
*18:30.540- 18:37.020* :  to provide legal support for victims of human rights violations. So just how significant is this
*18:37.020- 18:43.540* :  first aid convoy? It's potentially enormously significant for many, many hundreds of thousands
*18:43.820- 18:51.280* :  of Darfurians who are experiencing extremely acute hunger. At the same time, there are some
*18:51.280- 18:56.060* :  questions that we need to bear in mind. One is simply the weather. This is the very height
*18:56.060- 19:02.720* :  of Darfur's rainy season. Only paved roads are guaranteed to be navigable, and we are talking
*19:02.720- 19:09.240* :  about some long distance from Adre, for example, too. El Fajr, the besieged capital of North Darfur,
*19:09.240- 19:16.640* :  is over 400 kilometers. Much of that area is under the control of the rapid support forces of
*19:16.900- 19:22.860* :  a brutal, ruthless paramilitary force that has no training in international humanitarian
*19:23.680- 19:29.520* :  or human rights law. And it's not at all clear to me that they would allow humanitarian aid to
*19:29.520- 19:35.700* :  reach, for example, Zam Zam, an internally displaced capital where I have a, where I run a small
*19:35.700- 19:41.760* :  program and where I'm receiving constantly photographs of starving children. These are the kinds
*19:41.760- 19:49.740* :  of people who need to be reached. Eric Reeves. A man in Pakistan accused of spreading disinformation,
*19:49.740- 19:55.840* :  which is thought to have fueled the recent unrest in the UK, has had a case for cyber terrorism
*19:55.840- 20:02.600* :  filed against him, he's doing court on Thursday. Police say Farhan Asif, who's from the Punjab region,
*20:02.600- 20:09.100* :  is linked to a website which published false claims about last month's stabbings in Southport
*20:09.100- 20:15.840* :  in northwest England. It gave a wrong name for the suspected attacker and suggested he was an
*20:15.840- 20:22.720* :  asylum seeker. From Islamabad, he is our correspondent Caroline Davis. One police officer told the BBC
*20:22.720- 20:28.480* :  that during questioning Mr Asif admitted to writing the article, copying the content from a post
*20:28.480- 20:33.520* :  on social media, but failed to verify the information. According to the police report,
*20:33.520- 20:39.040* :  devices owned by Mr Asif were found to have a Twitter account for Channel 3 now active,
*20:39.580- 20:45.260* :  and Mr Asif had told the officers that he ran the account. Channel 3 now later took down the
*20:45.260- 20:50.420* :  article and issued an apology stating that the employees involved had been fired, but according
*20:50.420- 20:55.920* :  to the same officer, Mr Asif had told the police that he ran the site alone. The police report
*20:55.920- 21:01.480* :  states that he had previously provided misleading information to the BBC regarding his accomplices
*21:01.480- 21:07.620* :  in an attempt to divert blame to others. Mr Asif has had a case of cyber terrorism filed against him
*21:07.620- 21:13.580* :  by Pakistan's federal investigation agency. In Pakistan, only a court can decide to bring charges
*21:13.580- 21:18.940* :  on the basis of a police investigation. Pakistan's FIA is continuing to investigate whether
*21:18.940- 21:24.700* :  anyone else could have been involved. That was Caroline Davis in Pakistan. Scientists working
*21:24.700- 21:30.700* :  on India's lunar exploration missions say they found evidence that an ocean of magma once covered
*21:30.700- 21:35.760* :  the moon's south pole. The research is based on the findings of a robot lander sent to that region
*21:35.760- 21:42.820* :  of the moon last year. Georgina Ranard reports. Nearly a year ago to the day, India was preparing to do
*21:42.820- 21:53.440* :  something historic, land on the moon's unexplored south pole. They did it, the world celebrated,
*21:53.500- 21:58.880* :  and now we are seeing results. A rover that trundled around the area for 10 days
*21:59.380- 22:04.880* :  found remnants of an ancient ocean of lava, according to scientists at India's physical research
*22:04.880- 22:10.340* :  laboratory. The findings back up a theory that after the moon formed around four and a half
*22:10.340- 22:15.800* :  billion years ago, following a giant crash of two planetary bodies, it began to cool.
*22:16.620- 22:22.340* :  Lighter rock then rose to the surface. This ferroir and an author site may have been a slushy
*22:22.340- 22:28.580* :  ocean of lava for millions of years, eventually forming the moon's highlands. The findings bring
*22:28.580- 22:34.080* :  us one step closer to understanding this deeply mysterious region. On the next mission there,
*22:34.540- 22:38.480* :  scientists hope to find a source of water that could support a human base.
*22:39.160- 22:45.420* :  Georgina Ranard. The American Drug Safety Regulator, the FDA, has given approval this week to a
*22:45.420- 22:51.200* :  product designed to stop bleeding. It's called Trauma Gel and the company behind it Cresselon
*22:51.200- 22:57.260* :  says it could be game-changing and saving lives after injuries. Cresselon's chief executive is Joe
*22:57.260- 23:03.380* :  Landelina. Today for Trauma care, the best standard of care is what we call in Brooklyn pressure
*23:03.380- 23:08.800* :  and appraire, which is to pack the injury full of gauze. There are lots of special gauze
*23:08.800- 23:13.500* :  products out there that are pro-coagulants, meaning that they try to help stop bleeding faster,
*23:14.020- 23:19.740* :  but it all relies on this concept of getting your fingers into the wound, packing gauze inch by
*23:19.740- 23:24.920* :  inch, holding pressure for three, five, ten minutes, and hoping that the bleeding gets under control.
*23:24.920- 23:30.880* :  As we look at moving into what Cresselon is developing, we're trying to eliminate that process of
*23:30.880- 23:37.160* :  packing and drastically simplify the process of stopping bleeding. What we've developed is a
*23:37.160- 23:43.340* :  polymer. It comes out of algae that forms a gel that looks like hummus. It's a highly viscous gel
*23:43.900- 23:49.220* :  that can be flowable, meaning it can be injected into the deepest parts of any sort of
*23:49.220- 23:53.980* :  bleeding wound, whether it's a stab injury, a gunshot wound, a motor vehicle accident,
*23:53.980- 23:58.220* :  an elaceration, really anything where the bleeding is life-threatening. You put this product
*23:58.220- 24:03.600* :  into the wound, and nearly on contact, it creates a mechanical barrier, meaning it physically
*24:03.600- 24:08.160* :  stops the flow of bleeding by reassembling, and then it allows the patient to produce her own
*24:08.160- 24:13.220* :  clot. So if you take the gel off, you end up with the patient's own clot behind, without it getting
*24:13.220- 24:20.560* :  ripped off and wrapped around the gauze. If you look at battlefield death, 91% of preventable
*24:20.560- 24:26.140* :  battlefield death is related to hemorrhage, meaning that bleeding is the vast majority of causes,
*24:26.140- 24:31.340* :  or bleed out is the vast majority of cause of battlefield death, and if there were only a more
*24:31.340- 24:35.800* :  efficient or more effective method to stop bleeding countless lives could be saved.
*24:36.440- 24:42.220* :  Joe Landelina, gaming is a huge business raising more revenue than the music and movie
*24:49.580- 24:53.540* :  industries combined. A little snippet there of a new version of the Borderlands franchise which
*24:53.540- 24:58.760* :  kicked off Gamescom, the world's biggest gaming trade show, which is up and running in the German
*24:58.760- 25:04.160* :  city of Cologne. Gamescom showcases what's coming up in the gaming world over the next year.
*25:04.160- 25:10.260* :  Thousands of gamers flock to Cologne, while tens of thousands more follow it online. Our reporter
*25:10.260- 25:17.280* :  Andrew Rogers is watching it all. Gamescom is essentially now the world's biggest gaming convention.
*25:17.280- 25:23.440* :  The organizers say about 320,000 people attended last year, and it's a bit unique because it's almost
*25:23.440- 25:29.940* :  like two shows in one. On one side you've got the big festival of gaming where these thousands of
*25:29.980- 25:35.120* :  fans flock to this centre in Cologne in Germany to try out all these games that essentially aren't
*25:35.120- 25:40.180* :  out yet, so it's a bit of a preview. And then on the other side you've got all the big execs
*25:40.180- 25:45.460* :  from companies who meet behind closed doors to make these deals, and also wear journalists like us
*25:45.460- 25:50.140* :  get to see some of those games that are potentially not quite ready to show to the world yet.
*25:50.580- 25:55.760* :  So what are the highlights this year? To kick off into building that excitement for this event,
*25:55.780- 26:01.220* :  there's always opening night live, which is almost like a night of trailers to get people excited
*26:01.220- 26:06.200* :  for what's coming for the year ahead. Now that only includes the companies that are a part of
*26:06.200- 26:11.120* :  Gamescom, so there are a few big absences, Nintendo, which makes the switch isn't really involved,
*26:11.500- 26:16.000* :  but with all the other big manufacturers they were showing things off. One of those was Borderlands
*26:16.000- 26:21.920* :  for this. There's essentially a sci-fi comedy sort of hybrid. You might know it because there's
*26:21.920- 26:26.620* :  been a film recently that's come out. I had Kate Blanchett in it, Kevin Hart. It didn't really get
*26:26.620- 26:30.940* :  great reviews as the only thing. So the movie itself, not so successful, the game series though,
*26:30.940- 26:35.200* :  has always done well, and they're being a fourth one. There's quite a lot of hype around that,
*26:35.240- 26:39.700* :  and the trailer, even though it didn't really show us anything, will get people excited for a 2025
*26:39.700- 26:46.380* :  release. Now this industry, it's huge, it's worth tens of billions of dollars, but this year's
*26:46.380- 26:50.940* :  event is coming in a difficult time for the industry, isn't it? It is a tricky time, and that's
*26:50.980- 26:56.000* :  down to a few different factors. There was a big amount of growth, a lot of investment
*26:56.000- 27:01.580* :  during COVID-19 related lockdowns around the world. A lot of people spend more time inside,
*27:01.580- 27:07.040* :  they were playing a lot more games. That hasn't really stuck in the same way, and it's led to a lot
*27:07.040- 27:12.280* :  of consolidation within the industry, a lot of companies also laying off thousands of workers,
*27:12.900- 27:16.860* :  and there have been strikes over this year as well. The main thing, and the main thing from fans,
*27:16.960- 27:21.660* :  is that a lot of them say there's just not enough games to play at the moment. A lot of them are
*27:22.040- 27:26.960* :  seemingly waiting for 2025. That's why we're getting a lot of big announcements at the moment to
*27:26.960- 27:33.280* :  try and get people excited for the next lot, but certainly a lot of companies, especially Microsoft,
*27:33.880- 27:38.500* :  one of the big ones that is showing stuff off at Gamescom at the moment, trying to get people
*27:38.500- 27:42.840* :  excited for all the games they have coming up. After they bought a whole bunch of big studios
*27:42.840- 27:47.380* :  around the world, you might remember the news within the last year that they bought Activision,
*27:47.800- 27:51.260* :  one of the biggest gaming companies in the world, it was one of the biggest deals and take-overs,
*27:51.260- 27:56.220* :  just full stop, and for them to really make the most of the acquisition now with games that
*27:56.220- 28:02.000* :  lots of people are going to play and to have wider peel around the world. Andrew Rogers on Gamescom,
*28:02.000- 28:09.000* :  which is currently taking place in Cologne. And that's it from us for now, but there will be a new
