*01:31.840- 01:34.380* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:36.260- 01:41.940* :  I'm Nick Miles, I'm at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday, the 13th of August. These are our main stories.
*01:42.540- 01:47.640* :  Donald Trump has had a two hour long chat with Elon Musk about the economy, society,
*01:47.640- 01:54.140* :  and the election on the social media platform X. Indian hospitals are hit by a massive strike
*01:54.140- 02:01.000* :  after the rape and murder of a doctor, and danger averted, a huge wildfire threatening the Greek
*02:01.000- 02:09.620* :  capital Athens has been reduced to scattered hotspots. Also in this podcast, why European
*02:09.620- 02:12.800* :  airlines are dropping flight routes to the far east.
*02:17.740- 02:21.720* :  The anointing of Kamala Harris, as the Democrats' presidential candidate,
*02:22.160- 02:27.940* :  has sucked the oxygen of publicity from Donald Trump. Not being the center of mainstream media
*02:27.940- 02:32.840* :  attention is a predicament the former president finds very uncomfortable. So later on Monday,
*02:32.840- 02:39.240* :  he took to social media instead. He sat down for a live chat with Elon Musk on his platform X.
*02:39.420- 02:44.720* :  It was a wide-ranging discussion from the upcoming election to the U.S. economy,
*02:44.720- 02:50.600* :  the recent assassination attempt on Mr. Trump to crime in general. Donald Trump made a series
*02:50.600- 02:56.420* :  of unsubstantiated claims that went unchallenged. Crime all over the world is down. And
*02:56.420- 03:01.680* :  why do you see the numbers that we have? You know, this is migrant crime. These are rough people.
*03:01.980- 03:06.280* :  These are people that are in jail for murder and all sorts of things, and they're releasing
*03:06.280- 03:10.080* :  them into our country, and they're telling them, if you come back, we're going to kill you.
*03:10.080- 03:13.420* :  We're going to give you the death penalty or kill you, so they don't want to come back.
*03:13.760- 03:18.220* :  But these are rough people. These are criminals that make our criminals look like nice people,
*03:18.780- 03:23.640* :  and it's horrible what they're doing. Mr. Trump also described the Democrat rival Kamala Harris
*03:24.120- 03:28.640* :  as a radical left lunatic and said that anyone who votes for her needs their head examined.
*03:28.640- 03:34.120* :  Well, in a statement after the event, the Harris campaign described Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump as
*03:34.120- 03:39.920* :  two self-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a live stream
*03:39.920- 03:47.220* :  in the year 2024. For his part, Mr. Musk wrote on social media, happy to host Kamala on ex-spaces,
*03:47.220- 03:53.360* :  too. So what was behind the chat? Scott Jennings, a political strategist who was part of George
*03:53.360- 03:59.360* :  W. Bush's successful re-election campaign in 2004, told the BBC the ex-president is looking
*03:59.360- 04:04.840* :  to freshen up his campaign. A lot of his Republican supporters were very happy with the way he was
*04:04.840- 04:09.760* :  prosecuting the campaign against Biden because he had settled on a very tight and easy to understand
*04:09.760- 04:15.360* :  and user-friendly framework. It was strength versus weakness. They ruthlessly prosecuted that case,
*04:15.360- 04:19.940* :  and it was frankly pretty easy to do. Now, they're in a different race against a different person,
*04:19.940- 04:25.760* :  and he's not apparently personally settled on a framework within to prosecute the case against
*04:25.760- 04:30.800* :  Kamala Harris. A lot of Republicans wanted to be sort of radical liberal versus, you know,
*04:30.800- 04:36.380* :  common sense conservative, but he hasn't quite gotten there. He's not been able to beat that into
*04:36.380- 04:42.020* :  that sort of tight box that you could use to deliver again and again. And honestly, it's concerning
*04:42.020- 04:46.960* :  to a lot of his supporters because as she's had her surge in the polls and she's had her consolidation
*04:46.960- 04:51.280* :  of her democratic base, you know, they're sort of waiting for Donald Trump to come up with
*04:51.760- 04:56.060* :  the next trick up his sleeve to sort of reel it in. Can you know Musk make a difference?
*04:56.780- 05:02.160* :  Of course. I think it was smart for him to continue to cultivate this relationship. He's
*05:02.160- 05:07.360* :  very influential. He's very wealthy. Musk, I think, has been donating some money to the overall
*05:07.360- 05:12.260* :  Trump effort. He could obviously do a lot more, but there are a lot of people on the X platform
*05:12.260- 05:17.020* :  who simply don't get any of their information from the mainstream media. So they depend on the
*05:17.020- 05:22.240* :  X platform for their interaction with politics. And so yeah, I think if he continues to cultivate
*05:22.240- 05:27.360* :  Musk and the people who follow him, it could be a good thing because some of those people are
*05:27.360- 05:31.160* :  definitely going to be more inclined to be a Trump supporter than a Harris supporter,
*05:31.560- 05:35.740* :  but you're not going to reach him by, you know, CNN every night, but you might reach him on these
*05:36.000- 05:40.480* :  non-traditional platforms. So Trump was smart to do it. I expect Harris to do the same thing.
*05:40.480- 05:45.000* :  They're going to both be scraping and clawing to talk to every single person they can. And in our
*05:45.860- 05:49.840* :  people are increasingly getting information from places that aren't the mainstream news outlets.
*05:50.420- 05:56.940* :  The issue, though, is those few electors who might still be undecided in the battle for them,
*05:56.940- 06:01.700* :  and whether that battle does take place online or actually in the more traditional places.
*06:02.520- 06:06.220* :  Yeah, I think that there's two groups of people. There's the few persuadables, you know,
*06:06.220- 06:09.860* :  the folks who are genuinely torn about who to vote for. But more than that for Trump,
*06:09.860- 06:16.080* :  I think there's a whole group of low propensity voters or even no propensity voters, people who
*06:16.080- 06:21.500* :  don't often participate in US elections. If you look at the polling, Trump is quite popular among
*06:21.500- 06:28.500* :  those very politically disengaged Americans. And so if he can reach any of those on X or on any
*06:28.500- 06:33.480* :  other non-traditional platform, what he has the possibility of doing is changing the composition
*06:33.480- 06:39.280* :  of the electorate. So to me, it's maybe even less about persuasion of undecided and more about
*06:39.280- 06:43.800* :  convincing people who rarely vote to get in the game at all. The political strategist,
*06:43.860- 06:49.680* :  Scott Jennings, talking to Justin Webb. Well, Donald Trump has already hit out at Kamala Harris
*06:49.680- 06:55.600* :  over abortion, gun control, and the future of public education. And the battle over the nation's
*06:55.600- 07:00.760* :  schools is a particularly contentious issue in Arizona at the moment. Two years ago, the state
*07:00.760- 07:06.260* :  introduced publicly funded universal school vouchers, which parents can use to opt out of public
*07:06.260- 07:11.700* :  schools and pay for private education instead. Supporters who include Donald Trump say it's all
*07:11.700- 07:17.960* :  about school choice. Opponents say it's designed to undermine America's secular public education
*07:17.960- 07:27.240* :  system. From Phoenix, Alex Lastreports. It's early morning at Phoenix Christian preparatory school
*07:27.240- 07:32.400* :  and on the sports field, kids are running drills before the desert heat makes it unbearable
*07:32.400- 07:39.860* :  to train outdoors. When I first began, we were all Caucasian, white, generally middle to upper class,
*07:39.860- 07:46.120* :  and now we're a school of no majority. Jeff Blake is the school superintendent. His private
*07:46.120- 07:51.940* :  school is seen as a model by school choice advocates. Most of the kids here use state funded
*07:51.940- 07:57.480* :  programs to help pay the fees. And so we're about a third African-American, a third Caucasian,
*07:57.480- 08:03.440* :  a third Latino. They're coming on city buses and they're coming in in fancy automobiles.
*08:04.160- 08:08.560* :  The diversification could not have happened without school choice legislation.
*08:09.180- 08:15.480* :  In 2022, Arizona introduced a controversial policy, universal school vouchers,
*08:15.780- 08:21.280* :  which parents can use to pay for their child to go to private school or to cover homeschooling
*08:21.280- 08:27.420* :  expenses. On average, a voucher is worth around seven to eight thousand dollars a year. Roughly
*08:27.420- 08:31.620* :  equivalent, the amount the state might spend on educating a child in public school,
*08:31.620- 08:38.500* :  essentially the state is now subsidizing private education. And religion says Jeff is one reason
*08:38.500- 08:45.560* :  people want to go private. Public schools are becoming increasingly secularized. In many parents,
*08:45.560- 08:51.240* :  point of view, it's becoming opposed to their faith tradition. And a school like Phoenix
*08:51.240- 08:56.840* :  Christian provides a Christian worldview to look at the world through the eyes of the scriptures,
*08:56.840- 09:02.600* :  through the Bible. State schools in Arizona are secular, regulated, they're a standardized
*09:02.600- 09:08.280* :  tests. Teachers have to be qualified. No such rules applied. The private sector,
*09:08.820- 09:14.020* :  they can pretty much teach what they want, how they want. For some parents, that's the attraction
*09:14.060- 09:19.180* :  of private education. You know, I get a lot of weird looks because I say it's a parent's job
*09:19.180- 09:25.400* :  to indoctrinate their children into their belief system. Misha is a mum of five and is one of the
*09:25.400- 09:30.620* :  growing number who've opted to homeschool their kids using vouchers to buy books and pay for extra
*09:30.620- 09:36.440* :  curricular activities. She feels the public school curriculum goes against her beliefs. For us,
*09:36.440- 09:41.840* :  we're pretty traditional Christian, you know, we believe in creation, but they treat evolution as
*09:41.840- 09:46.480* :  though it's fact, even though it's called the evolutionary theory. Misha says she's worried
*09:46.480- 09:52.180* :  too about how schools discuss racism in America and in particular, the age at which gender and
*09:52.180- 09:56.820* :  sexuality are talked about in school. People have a right to live their life the way they want it.
*09:56.820- 10:01.100* :  That's absolutely okay, but I don't like that being brought into my kids so young.
*10:01.840- 10:07.200* :  There is though opposition to vouchers. One of the big issues is the cost. A report by the
*10:07.200- 10:12.900* :  non-partisan think tank the Grand Canyon Institute estimates the net cost of universal vouchers
*10:12.900- 10:20.780* :  is $320 million this year and it's projected to rise even further. That they say puts a big hole
*10:20.780- 10:27.520* :  in the state finances. Our schools facing dire budget cuts in light of this voucher system.
*10:28.120- 10:33.520* :  Beth Lewis is executive director of Save Our Schools Arizona, a campaign group led by parents
*10:33.520- 10:38.900* :  and teachers. We also are very concerned to see the types of schools that are popping up in
*10:38.900- 10:43.760* :  Arizona in response to this voucher program. You know, a lot of extremists and indoctrination
*10:43.760- 10:51.100* :  academies opening up. There is a lot of curriculum that is very anti-LGBTQ. It's not rooted in real
*10:51.100- 10:56.480* :  history or real science. What's wrong with a parent deciding to send their kid to such a place if
*10:56.480- 11:02.800* :  that's what they want? I don't have any problem with a parent making that choice, but I think that
*11:02.800- 11:09.560* :  our taxpayer dollars shouldn't go to fund that choice. Republicans have cited Arizona's universal
*11:09.560- 11:15.960* :  voucher program as a model for others to follow and Donald Trump is a big supporter of school choice.
*11:15.960- 11:22.140* :  But for Beth Lewis, vouchers could threaten the very existence of public education in America.
*11:22.640- 11:28.680* :  The end goal is to privatize our public school system and I do fear that that is a very
*11:28.680- 11:35.400* :  round turn for America. That report was by Alex Last. There's growing shock and anger across
*11:35.400- 11:42.800* :  India at the murder of a trainee doctor inside a state-run hospital in Kolkata. The woman's
*11:42.800- 11:47.980* :  body was found with multiple injuries last Friday. Doctors across the country are now on strike
*11:47.980- 11:54.120* :  calling for justice and better workplace security. One protestor outside a hospital in Kolkata
*11:54.120- 12:00.320* :  said there should be no further delay in the investigation. We demand that they complete their
*12:00.320- 12:06.220* :  investigation and arrest the culprits immediately. It's been 48 hours since the incident occurred
*12:06.760- 12:11.100* :  and we're not interested in paying any attention to baseless rumors around the case.
*12:12.420- 12:15.460* :  Our correspondent in Delhi, Umang Pada, told me more.
*12:15.900- 12:20.700* :  The protests have been happening across multiple cities in the capital Delhi, also 10 big
*12:20.700- 12:25.480* :  government hospitals have suspended some of their services although emergency services are
*12:25.480- 12:30.760* :  still going on. But despite that yesterday also I visited some hospitals to just like see what's
*12:30.760- 12:34.140* :  happening in that and the doctors were saying that the number of patients right now which has
*12:34.140- 12:39.040* :  eased less because of the strike. And there have been concerns raised by patients also that they
*12:39.040- 12:43.660* :  are having trouble getting that equate health care. So the protests are widespread and it's impacted
*12:43.660- 12:49.760* :  the patients also as well as the doctors. So the doctors are on strike. One imagines that they don't
*12:49.760- 12:55.340* :  want patients to suffer. What are they asking for? What is this an indefinite strike?
*12:56.440- 13:01.480* :  Right. So they haven't told a date when they'll call of the strike although multiple people to
*13:01.480- 13:06.580* :  deeven the court here in the matter requested them to join their services back. One thing which
*13:06.580- 13:10.020* :  they're doing is they're saying that we are not stopping the emergency health care services
*13:10.660- 13:14.780* :  wherever the strikes are happening so that like people who need urgent care can get that.
*13:15.340- 13:19.240* :  Apart from that thing, the first thing is which they're asking for is a proper investigation
*13:19.240- 13:23.820* :  in this matter and for a rest to be made quickly. And the second thing they're asking for like
*13:23.820- 13:28.700* :  better long term solutions also for security of health care professionals. For example,
*13:28.700- 13:34.280* :  like having a centralized law which can deal with these things, having more preventive measures
*13:34.280- 13:38.460* :  rather than measures which take place after incidents like these have happened.
*13:38.780- 13:43.660* :  And did I because this was the murder of a trainee doctor within a hospital. I mean that
*13:43.660- 13:49.220* :  will shock huge numbers of people because here is somebody who was there to make people healthy
*13:49.220- 13:55.320* :  and that she was attacked in this brutal way. Right. And also a bunch of our colleagues also went
*13:55.320- 14:00.300* :  to like different hospitals in different states. And this was something which like all doctors
*14:00.300- 14:05.640* :  said that they have seen instances of violence in the past where like patients or their
*14:05.640- 14:10.160* :  family members have come and threatened doctors if they have not been happy with the services.
*14:10.900- 14:15.660* :  So violence against health care professionals is something which like people have seen in the past
*14:15.660- 14:20.280* :  but the gravity of this particular incident is something which has made this one that's much
*14:20.280- 14:27.480* :  more shocking. Umang Pada in Delhi. British Airways is canceling its flights from London to Beijing
*14:27.480- 14:33.760* :  and it is not the only airline that's pulled back from China. Since 2022, the ban on flying
*14:33.760- 14:38.600* :  over Russian airspace has added hours to these routes driving up the costs.
*14:38.600- 14:44.460* :  Joanna Bailey is the editor of the Aviation News website simple flying. She spoke to Leanne
*14:44.460- 14:49.380* :  Bern. The routes to Beijing, well particularly to anywhere in East Asia are really important for
*14:49.380- 14:54.940* :  airlines in terms of economic connectivity and their improperability. But it's the
*14:55.120- 15:00.820* :  overflight ban in Russia has really caused financial headaches. So, you know, they're having to
*15:01.040- 15:06.540* :  go these very circuitous routes which adds to their fuel costs. It adds to their CO2. And they're
*15:06.540- 15:11.340* :  also competing with airlines that don't have to face the same ban. So, it's kind of an unlevel
*15:11.340- 15:16.940* :  playing field and I'm not so surprised to see the April out. You know, we saw Virgin announcing that
*15:16.940- 15:22.580* :  it was leaving Shanghai at the end of November. So, I think we're going to be limited for connectivity
*15:22.580- 15:28.340* :  from British airlines and from EU airlines going to the far east. But all the Chinese carriers
*15:28.340- 15:33.080* :  are capitalising very nicely on this. I'm sure they are absolutely. I mean, do we know the
*15:33.080- 15:38.080* :  cost implications of having to avoid Russian airspace? I mean, you mentioned fuel. I'm sure crew
*15:38.080- 15:43.740* :  time as well. Other operational costs are probably factored in. Yeah, I mean, I had a quick look at
*15:43.740- 15:48.600* :  the Beijing route when BA announced this and they were flying on average at extra one and a half
*15:48.600- 15:53.180* :  hours when they're going east and an extra two and a half hours when they're coming back from China.
*15:53.880- 15:58.380* :  So, you can imagine, I mean, it obviously depends which aircraft they're flying, but fuel costs
*15:58.380- 16:02.540* :  for an hour and a plane, a lot. I mean, we're talking in the tens of thousands of dollars. So,
*16:02.820- 16:07.220* :  just adding on another couple of hours makes a huge difference. And as you mentioned, it's already
*16:07.220- 16:12.680* :  a very long route, which means that crew accommodation needs to be higher than it would be on a short
*16:12.680- 16:16.740* :  hill route because you've got to have people in rest periods and then, you know, people coming back
*16:16.740- 16:21.960* :  to work the cabin. You actually need another whole set of flight attendants and an extra pilot to
*16:21.960- 16:27.060* :  make these routes work. So, it's not just the obvious costs like the fuel in the longer time. It's also
*16:27.060- 16:32.760* :  these personal costs, you know, and pilots don't come cheap. Virgin also pulled out to US majors
*16:32.760- 16:37.380* :  have found it very difficult to get back into China. I mean, they're nowhere near where they were,
*16:37.940- 16:42.820* :  you know, back in 2019 before the pandemic. Everybody was still kind of in this recovery period.
*16:43.080- 16:48.960* :  And the Russian overflight ban has really kind of stunted any growth from our western airlines
*16:48.980- 16:54.260* :  going out there. However, the opposite is visible when we look at what's happening from China to
*16:54.680- 17:00.820* :  the European cities and countries because they're actually up to 16% over 2019. So there's another
*17:00.820- 17:09.120* :  16% of flights since then in comparison, UK and EU airlines are down 50%. That was Joanna Bailey of
*17:09.120- 17:19.680* :  the Aviation News website's Simple Flying. Still to come in this podcast. Our bedbugs sniffing

*17:26.840- 17:32.220* :  How the authorities in South Korea are trying to avoid on welcome insects creeping into the country.
*17:41.680- 17:46.320* :  Ryan Reynolds here for I guess my 100th mid commercial. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*17:46.680- 17:50.240* :  No, you know, honestly, when I started this, I thought I'd only have to do, like, four
*17:50.240- 17:50.620* :  of these.
*17:50.920- 17:54.120* :  I mean, it's unlimited, premium, wireless, for $15 a month.
*17:54.200- 17:57.140* :  How are there still people paying two or three times that much?
*17:57.740- 17:59.220* :  I'm sorry, I shouldn't be victim blaming here.

*18:45.920- 18:51.440* :  The Israeli military is saying it's at peak alert for a potential attack by Iran.
*18:52.120- 18:56.560* :  The government in Tehran has said it will take revenge for the killing of a Hamas commander
*18:56.560- 18:58.520* :  on its territory early this month.
*18:59.120- 19:03.520* :  It's a conflict that could spill over into Lebanon where Iran backs the Hezbollah group.
*19:04.000- 19:08.800* :  And if a war between Israel and Hezbollah goes ahead, Lebanon fears that a million people
*19:08.800- 19:10.920* :  could become displaced in the country.
*19:11.600- 19:16.380* :  Lebanese minister in charge of coordinating an emergency plan is NASA Yassin.
*19:16.800- 19:21.420* :  Our correspondent, Kareen Torbe, has been speaking to him and began by asking him if
*19:21.420- 19:23.580* :  Lebanon was prepared for an all-out war.
*19:24.320- 19:29.700* :  We're doing our best to get our levels of preparedness for such an all-out war.
*19:30.320- 19:34.140* :  But let's be honest and frank from the beginning.
*19:34.700- 19:40.840* :  No country on earth, even those who are more developed, who have better stability and
*19:40.840- 19:46.980* :  functioning systems, would stand, you know, with such a killing machine and genocide
*19:46.980- 19:49.240* :  in the machine that we're witnessing in Gaza.
*19:50.060- 19:56.060* :  What's happening in Gaza and South Lebanon is an actual war, is an actual act of war that
*19:56.060- 19:57.360* :  no country can stand.
*19:57.800- 20:05.280* :  So we are conscious and aware of all the constraints and all the limitations and challenges.
*20:05.920- 20:10.940* :  But we're taking our responsibility as a functioning government to actually protect the people
*20:10.940- 20:16.620* :  of Lebanon diplomatically on one track, but also in case there's an all-out attack and
*20:16.620- 20:22.500* :  aggression on us to be prepared to get the people into shelter, provide them the basic
*20:22.540- 20:26.680* :  food, water and sanitation, medication and so on.
*20:27.300- 20:31.520* :  And what scenarios are you expecting in case of, you know, a very...
*20:31.520- 20:33.120* :  We're working on different scenarios.
*20:33.120- 20:40.220* :  The worst case scenario is the scenario that we witnessed in July 2006 when the Israel
*20:40.220- 20:44.400* :  is, you know, wage a war on Lebanon for 33 days.
*20:45.000- 20:49.580* :  And that scenario resulted in more than one million Lebanese being displaced for around
*20:49.580- 20:50.280* :  five weeks.
*20:50.680- 20:57.640* :  So we're taking this as a benchmark, as a point where we're comparing with and assessing
*20:57.640- 21:02.040* :  our level of preparedness and the needs we need to have in order to be prepared for such
*21:02.040- 21:02.460* :  scenario.
*21:02.960- 21:06.180* :  And does Lebanon have the means to deal with such challenges?
*21:07.520- 21:09.740* :  Again, no country has such means.
*21:10.800- 21:16.500* :  If you look at the current context of such, you know, a killing machine that we're seeing
*21:16.500- 21:17.440* :  now in the region.
*21:18.200- 21:25.920* :  But we are putting aside some contingency funding, given the level of finances and the
*21:25.920- 21:28.440* :  challenges we have in the Treasury and Lebanon.
*21:28.440- 21:31.760* :  But we're putting aside some contingency financing for the basic things.
*21:32.400- 21:39.240* :  Health, civil defense, including rubber removal and, you know, additional food and basic
*21:39.240- 21:44.560* :  supplies for people if they get displaced or be forced to be displaced from their houses.
*21:45.240- 21:49.200* :  That was the Lebanese minister, NASA, yes he is speaking, to Garene Torby.
*21:50.100- 21:55.040* :  Ukraine's military push into parts of Western Russia was a move that few people anticipated.
*21:55.640- 22:00.080* :  And now eight days after it began, thousands of Ukrainian troops are still operating in
*22:00.080- 22:00.900* :  Russian territory.
*22:00.900- 22:05.720* :  On Monday, President Putin accused Ukraine of committing crimes against the Russian people.
*22:05.800- 22:08.860* :  He said Kiev would receive a worthy response.
*22:08.980- 22:13.700* :  And on Tuesday morning, Ukraine's air force said air raid sirens have been activated
*22:13.700- 22:16.860* :  across the country, following reports of Russian air strikes.
*22:17.440- 22:19.980* :  But how is Ukraine's incursion being viewed in Russia?
*22:20.400- 22:21.900* :  Here's the view from the streets of Moscow.
*22:22.420- 22:31.220* :  Honestly, I only follow the news when I'm listening to the radio in the car in the morning.
*22:31.980- 22:35.600* :  I feel sorry for the people who have ended up in this situation.
*22:36.640- 22:38.540* :  I would like this all to end.
*22:40.000- 22:43.280* :  It wasn't a surprise.
*22:43.800- 22:44.940* :  I think time will mend things.
*22:45.660- 22:47.680* :  Maybe it's the kind of reaction that was supposed to happen.
*22:48.460- 22:49.920* :  And they probably should have been ready for anything.
*22:50.300- 22:51.720* :  Well, I think it's a tragedy.
*22:51.860- 22:57.640* :  I think that we should all, as Russian people, help our neighbors, people who live in this region.
*22:58.440- 23:01.300* :  And how is this all being reported inside Russia?
*23:01.740- 23:05.100* :  Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg, has been speaking to James Coppinoff.
*23:05.400- 23:10.820* :  What is happening in southern Russia is a huge deal because this is the first time in
*23:10.820- 23:16.820* :  more than 80 years that foreign troops have crossed into Russia and on Russian soil,
*23:16.820- 23:19.240* :  fighting on Russian soil and seizing Russian territory.
*23:19.240- 23:25.640* :  And for a country which is constantly reminded here by those in power of the horrors of the
*23:25.640- 23:31.440* :  Second World War, the horrors of invasion, the World War II is really part of the psyche of this nation.
*23:32.100- 23:33.620* :  You know, this is a huge deal.
*23:34.100- 23:41.280* :  Is it the sort of huge deal that is likely to rally support behind the war effort,
*23:41.920- 23:46.660* :  behind further conflict with Ukraine, or could it cause division, do you think?
*23:47.380- 23:52.600* :  In a sense, what is happening, plays into Vladimir Putin's longstanding narrative
*23:53.480- 23:59.600* :  that Russia is under threat, that Russia is a besieged fortress surrounded by enemies
*23:59.600- 24:05.520* :  who are sort of plotting night and day to invade and destroy and divide Russia into small pieces.
*24:05.520- 24:10.580* :  This is the kind of narrative you hear in the state media here from morning till night.
*24:11.540- 24:15.120* :  However, on the streets of Moscow yesterday, and we were chatting to people,
*24:15.120- 24:18.600* :  and I got a sense of deep resignation from people.
*24:18.600- 24:21.440* :  People seemed to be resigned to what is happening.
*24:21.440- 24:27.140* :  I didn't get the feeling that people were about to rally around the flag and the president and the government
*24:27.740- 24:29.600* :  and look for an escalation of this.
*24:29.600- 24:34.820* :  People have seen so much happening over the last two and a half years, so many dramatic events
*24:34.820- 24:38.160* :  starting with, of course, the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine,
*24:39.000- 24:42.280* :  partial mobilization declared by the Kremlin last year.
*24:42.280- 24:45.520* :  Do you remember that mutiny by Vogni mercenaries who marched on Moscow?
*24:45.580- 24:51.520* :  So many dramatic events, that now we have another dramatic event, Ukrainian soldiers
*24:52.140- 24:54.360* :  seizing villages in southern Russia.
*24:55.100- 25:00.480* :  This has been such a rollercoaster for people here, that I think they're just resigned
*25:00.480- 25:05.580* :  to what is happening, and people do not feel they can influence the situation in any way,
*25:06.120- 25:08.640* :  and they're just waiting to see how things pan out.
*25:09.040- 25:09.880* :  Steve Rosenberg.
*25:10.880- 25:14.920* :  Now, to Greece, where the wildfires that have been sweeping around the capital Athens
*25:14.940- 25:19.220* :  have left scenes of utter devastation and forced many people to leave their homes.
*25:22.020- 25:25.360* :  My house, it was utterly destroyed, even the walls fell down.
*25:25.800- 25:26.620* :  There's nothing left.
*25:27.400- 25:28.880* :  There's no morale, no courage.
*25:29.580- 25:30.560* :  There's no money anymore.
*25:30.560- 25:31.840* :  Everything was destroyed.
*25:32.320- 25:35.520* :  The house, the only thing I cared about was saving my dogs,
*25:36.280- 25:37.480* :  so I left everything behind.
*25:38.200- 25:40.100* :  Money, belongings, everything.
*25:41.900- 25:46.020* :  I first arrived early when the area was burning and they didn't let us approach,
*25:46.020- 25:48.460* :  so we didn't know what was happening with the house.
*25:48.940- 25:52.440* :  We didn't know if we would find it again, because we have pine trees in the yard,
*25:53.260- 25:55.740* :  when we were able to pass at about 11 p.m.
*25:56.020- 25:58.900* :  and saw that the house was still standing, it was something else.
*26:01.900- 26:05.580* :  But now there are positive signs that the fires are finally being brought under control.
*26:06.140- 26:09.240* :  Officials say the walls are flame that left tens of metres into the air
*26:09.540- 26:12.440* :  have now been reduced to a few scattered hot spots.
*26:12.920- 26:15.460* :  Our correspondent Jessica Parker was at Nairpentelli,
*26:15.460- 26:17.080* :  northeast of the centre of Athens.
*26:17.600- 26:20.160* :  We headed to this suburb of northeast Athens,
*26:20.360- 26:23.580* :  one of the areas that was hit by those wildfires,
*26:24.040- 26:26.860* :  and it's quite interesting when you survey the damage.
*26:26.860- 26:31.720* :  It's very patchy, so I'm looking right now at two completely burnt out vehicles,
*26:31.740- 26:37.580* :  a van and a car, and then another patch of land can actually be relatively undamaged,
*26:37.600- 26:41.260* :  and we've also seen places where there's a house that has been severely damaged,
*26:41.260- 26:44.300* :  but then a property nearby is completely fine.
*26:44.380- 26:47.900* :  So it has made its way the wildfire through this area,
*26:48.420- 26:50.400* :  but in quite a kind of disparate way,
*26:51.120- 26:54.540* :  what we're hearing from the fire service in terms of the bigger picture is that,
*26:55.260- 26:57.780* :  as you were mentioning, no major active front anymore,
*26:57.780- 26:59.440* :  they're dealing with scattered hot spots,
*26:59.940- 27:00.760* :  but it's still really hot.
*27:01.240- 27:03.220* :  The winds pick up a lot from time to time,
*27:03.640- 27:07.740* :  and I do keep seeing those canadaire water planes that dive in and get water,
*27:07.740- 27:12.400* :  and then drop it on areas that need to have that, need to see water.
*27:12.780- 27:15.840* :  They keep flying over our heads, so I think very much the authorities
*27:16.360- 27:19.380* :  still keeping an eye on the area and trying to make sure those hot spots
*27:19.720- 27:20.900* :  don't develop into something worse.
*27:21.140- 27:22.600* :  So the conditions haven't improved.
*27:22.660- 27:26.500* :  Is it sheer force of numbers of the firefighters that's done this?
*27:26.940- 27:31.680* :  It's kind of difficult for sure to say exactly how they've managed to dampen this down.
*27:31.680- 27:35.320* :  Hundreds of firefighters have been out overnight, though,
*27:35.320- 27:39.540* :  of course, they had to ground aircraft that were monitoring things in the sky,
*27:39.540- 27:42.580* :  but also helping tackle the fires because they do that after dark.
*27:42.580- 27:47.840* :  But from this morning, it seemed like the situation was improved quite significantly,
*27:47.900- 27:53.520* :  and you could partly tell that because the sky of Athens was no longer this big kind of gray cloud,
*27:53.520- 27:55.460* :  as it had been yesterday.
*27:55.460- 27:58.580* :  The sky's much clearer, although I have to say where I am in other places,
*27:58.580- 28:04.300* :  we've been where there's a lot of burnt out pine trees and kind of burnt out ground.
*28:04.300- 28:08.520* :  It's still, you can really smell the fire that was there not long ago.
*28:09.120- 28:13.440* :  But look, I think the authorities have been defending their response to this fire,
*28:13.440- 28:17.140* :  saying they think they acted quickly, and that is, of course, amid fresh criticism
*28:17.140- 28:21.880* :  that this has happened again, a wildfire has broken out again in the East Attica region,
*28:21.940- 28:24.800* :  and even reached into the suburbs of the capital city.
*28:25.480- 28:26.800* :  Jessica Parker in Athens.
*28:28.020- 28:32.040* :  Paris is still basking in the glow of the success of the Olympic Games,
*28:32.040- 28:38.080* :  but athletes returning to South Korea might spend a bit more time in arrivals than usual.
*28:38.080- 28:43.100* :  A special team has been deployed at the Incheon International Airport in South Korea
*28:43.600- 28:47.420* :  to make sure athletes don't have any creepy crawlies in their suitcases.
*28:49.380- 28:53.340* :  The Bedbug crisis in Paris made headline news in October last year,
*28:53.640- 28:59.740* :  and videos of them crawling on the Paris Metro helped provoke a wave of insectophobia
*28:59.740- 29:05.160* :  in the run-up to the Olympic Games. South Korea is also no stranger to Bedbugs,
*29:05.460- 29:11.160* :  an infestation in 2023 caused widespread alarm, but was swiftly dealt with.
*29:11.740- 29:16.000* :  Now the authorities are determined to prevent any possibility of Bedbugs
*29:16.000- 29:21.160* :  free-loading their way into the country inside the suitcases of its Olympic athletes.
*29:21.780- 29:25.120* :  The star of the South Korean campaign is a two-year-old beagle,
*29:25.120- 29:30.800* :  which the team's researcher Kim Min-soo insists has a real knack for sniffing them out.
*29:37.760- 29:43.260* :  Our Bedbugs sniffing dogs, Seco, can detect the pheromone-sense specific to Bedbugs
*29:43.260- 29:49.440* :  with more than 95% accuracy. It can be sensitive for travelers to have someone open their suitcases,
*29:49.820- 29:55.080* :  but Seco can detect Bedbugs by sniffing the air inside a suitcase with only about a third of the
*29:55.080- 30:02.280* :  zip open. Bedbugs hide in bed frames, mattress, seams, cushions, and even in the crevices of furniture,
*30:02.280- 30:07.560* :  then they feast on people's blood while they're sleeping. Although they don't spread disease,
*30:07.560- 30:13.520* :  the itchy bites are guaranteed to send you up the wall. Experts say they've been making a
*30:13.520- 30:18.780* :  comeback over the past two or three decades all over the world. Wendy Erkert.
*30:21.260- 30:24.480* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*30:24.480- 30:29.660* :  later on. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an
*30:29.660- 30:36.840* :  email. The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on x at Global News Pod.
*30:37.380- 30:43.020* :  This edition was mixed by Sydney Danden and the producer was Oliver Burlow. The editor is Karen
