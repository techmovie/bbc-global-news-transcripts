*00:46.580- 00:51.280* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*00:51.460- 00:56.080* :  They charge you a lot. We charge you a little. So naturally, when they announce that
*00:56.080- 01:01.660* :  they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*01:01.920- 01:06.960* :  That's right. We're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*01:19.400- 01:23.380* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.380- 01:29.680* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Friday, the 2nd of August, these are our main stories.
*01:29.680- 01:35.600* :  We have more details on the major prisoner swap that's taken place between Russia and the West.
*01:35.600- 01:39.060* :  President Biden described it as a feat of diplomacy.
*01:39.180- 01:45.280* :  The head of his baller, Hassan Nazrallah, says Israel cross red lines by killing one of its
*01:45.300- 01:47.520* :  commanders and can expect revenge.
*01:49.340- 01:59.100* :  Also in this podcast, I can't emphasize how painful it has been to be living 23 years after
*01:59.100- 02:04.480* :  my sister was murdered and to fear that I would die before there was justice.
*02:05.180- 02:11.100* :  As three men accused of plotting the 9-11 terrorist attacks in the US receive a plea deal,
*02:11.480- 02:14.620* :  we get reaction from a family member of one of the victims.
*02:15.500- 02:21.180* :  In the Olympics, a clash in the women's boxing competition was abandoned after just 46 seconds,
*02:21.660- 02:24.540* :  amidst controversy over gender eligibility rules.
*02:25.300- 02:28.900* :  And there's a final farewell to British tennis legend Andy Murray,
*02:29.320- 02:31.400* :  whose Olympic hopes have come to an end.
*02:35.560- 02:40.400* :  We've been getting more details of the largest East-West swap of prisoners in decades,
*02:40.400- 02:46.200* :  between Russia and Belarus on one hand and the US, Germany and other European countries on the
*02:46.200- 02:52.200* :  other. The exchange of a total of 26 people, including two children, was made in Ankara in Turkey.
*02:52.860- 02:57.380* :  The Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed his nationals at the airport when they returned.
*03:04.840- 03:10.340* :  Mr. Putin congratulated them, saying Russia, the motherland, didn't forget about them for a minute.
*03:11.120- 03:16.380* :  It comes after a discussion about a prisoner swap for the American journalist Evan Gershkovich,
*03:16.640- 03:19.840* :  who'd been detained in Russia and given a hefty jail sentence.
*03:20.480- 03:26.360* :  Natalia Pellevina is a Russian opposition activist in exile, who knows the high-profile Kremlin
*03:26.360- 03:30.280* :  critic Vladimir Karamurtsa, also one of those being exchanged.
*03:30.940- 03:34.340* :  We're very happy because we know that now they will make it, they will survive,
*03:34.340- 03:40.100* :  which unfortunately for instance Alexei Navalny did not. The conditions that political prisoners
*03:40.100- 03:45.700* :  are kept in and Russia are absolutely horrendous. Every effort is made to make their life as horrible,
*03:45.740- 03:53.540* :  as impossible, as could be. Many of them were suffering health issues already, so it was clear that
*03:53.540- 03:59.580* :  unless something like this was to happen that many of them just won't survive. Now they will
*03:59.580- 04:04.060* :  keep living, that's a really great news. Here's our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg.
*04:04.800- 04:10.440* :  It was the largest east-west prisoner exchange since the Cold War. It involved 26 people
*04:10.440- 04:15.620* :  being held in seven different countries. The location had been a closely guarded secret,
*04:16.120- 04:19.260* :  Ankara Airport. Among those freed from Russian Jails,
*04:19.260- 04:25.500* :  Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, former US Marine Paul Wheelan. He'd spent more than
*04:25.500- 04:32.400* :  five years behind bars, and US Russian journalist Al Sookhor Marshiver. America has repeatedly
*04:32.400- 04:38.620* :  accused Moscow of jailing US citizens to use them as bargaining chips to free Russians jailed abroad.
*04:39.720- 04:44.740* :  Released to and now out of the country, prominent Kremlin critics and anti-war campaigners,
*04:44.740- 04:51.200* :  like Vladimir Karamazah and Ilya Yashin. Speaking later from the White House, President Biden
*04:51.200- 04:55.620* :  gave his reaction to the news. It says a lot about the United States that we work
*04:55.620- 05:01.840* :  relentlessly to free Americans who are unjustly held around the world. It also says a lot about us
*05:02.340- 05:07.240* :  that this deal includes the release of Russian political prisoners. They stood up for democracy
*05:07.240- 05:12.940* :  and human rights. They're all leaders to them in prison. The United States helps secure their
*05:12.940- 05:19.220* :  release as well. In exchange, 10 people are returning to Russia, among them spies and agents,
*05:19.620- 05:25.620* :  including Vadim Krasikov, a convicted assassin identified by a German court as having links to the
*05:25.620- 05:30.280* :  Russian state. For the families and friends of those released today from Russian prisons,
*05:30.280- 05:35.140* :  this is a moment to celebrate. But for the Kremlin, this is mission accomplished.
*05:35.140- 05:42.000* :  It got what it wanted. It got its agents back. The likely takeaway for Moscow will be that hostage
*05:42.000- 05:48.620* :  diplomacy works. And that means we're likely to see more of it, more prisoners, foreigners,
*05:48.620- 05:55.880* :  and Russians being used here as bargaining chips. Steve Rosenberg, as we've heard President Biden
*05:55.880- 06:01.580* :  hailed the prisoner's swap as a feat of diplomacy. The White House National Security Adviser Jake
*06:01.580- 06:07.920* :  Sullivan confirmed no money had exchanged hands and no sanctions relaxed to facilitate the deal
*06:08.320- 06:13.260* :  after a former President Trump criticized the swap. I spoke to our Washington correspondent
*06:13.260- 06:19.540* :  Nomeh Igbel about the timing of the exchange. Well, we know that this has been a month's long
*06:19.540- 06:25.100* :  negotiations. A senior administration official did tell the BBC that Vice President Harris was
*06:25.100- 06:30.420* :  actually involved in very critical meetings as far as back as mid-February. And that's when she
*06:30.420- 06:36.300* :  attended the Munich Security Conference meeting privately with the Chancellor of Germany to stress
*06:36.300- 06:41.780* :  the importance of releasing Vadim Krasikov, who's the main person that Vladimir Putin wanted,
*06:41.780- 06:46.640* :  but she also met with the Prime Minister of Slovenia. And the White House says that her requests
*06:46.720- 06:51.940* :  in these meetings became part of the prisoner deal. But I think it's fair to sort of read into the
*06:51.940- 06:57.400* :  facts that President Biden is legacy building. And there was a very interesting detail in the Wall
*06:57.400- 07:03.220* :  Street Journal's reporting, which said that President Biden, just about an hour before he notified
*07:03.220- 07:08.960* :  everyone that he was dropping out the presidential race on July 21st, called the Prime Minister of
*07:08.960- 07:14.720* :  Slovenia. Slovenia has contributed two convicted Russian spies to the swap to try and secure the
*07:14.720- 07:20.160* :  pardon that was necessary. So I think there's some element of that as well. President Biden wants
*07:20.160- 07:26.240* :  to show that his administration can negotiate with Russia. And he is said in a statement released
*07:26.300- 07:30.080* :  today there is no higher priority of his than to get Americans back safe.
*07:31.120- 07:37.540* :  Nomea Iqbal, the head of Hezbollah Hassan Nazralla says the battle with Israel has entered a new
*07:37.540- 07:44.360* :  stage on all fronts after it killed the top Hezbollah military commander Pua Chukka. In a speech
*07:44.360- 07:49.840* :  delivered from an undisclosed location at the commander's funeral, Sheet Nazralla said Hezbollah
*07:49.840- 07:56.240* :  is considering what he called a real studied response to the attack. It comes as a funeral was
*07:56.240- 08:01.800* :  being held in Iran for Hamas political chief Ismail Henea, who was assassinated on Wednesday.
*08:02.540- 08:06.420* :  A diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams compiled this report from Jerusalem.
*08:07.180- 08:12.380* :  Israel is used to assassinating its opponents, but even so this has been a remarkable week.
*08:12.920- 08:17.620* :  This morning came confirmation that an Israeli air raid on the Gaza Strip almost three weeks ago
*08:17.620- 08:23.840* :  killed Muhammad Daif, one of the two most senior Hamas commanders. The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*08:23.840- 08:29.120* :  said Mr. Daif had been responsible for the massacres of October the 7th, as well as many other attacks.
*08:29.580- 08:35.600* :  He was Israel's number one wanted men for years. His elimination establishes a simple principle
*08:35.600- 08:45.060* :  that we established. Whoever hurts us, we hurt him. A thousand miles to the east, Iran's Supreme
*08:45.060- 08:51.040* :  leader Ayatollah Ali Hamaneh offered prayers at the funeral of Hamas's political leader Ismail Henea.
*08:55.620- 08:59.960* :  Thousands turned out in Tehran, where Mr. Henea was killed early yesterday morning.
*09:00.660- 09:05.420* :  Initial indications pointed to an Israeli air strike, but now it's been reported that he may have
*09:05.420- 09:10.640* :  been blown up by a remotely detonated bomb planted two months ago. However it happened,
*09:10.640- 09:16.160* :  it represented another crushing security failure for the Iranian authorities, one which the
*09:16.160- 09:23.880* :  Supreme leader has vowed to avenge. In the Lebanese capital, the fallout from another Israeli
*09:23.880- 09:28.740* :  assassination, this time a top commander from the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah.
*09:28.780- 09:33.680* :  Israel claimed that Fouad Shukar was responsible for a rocket attack last weekend,
*09:33.680- 09:40.540* :  which killed 12 children in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. A huge crowd turned out to hear
*09:40.540- 09:49.040* :  the response of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Lassarullah. He tuned vowed revenge and spoke of a battle
*09:49.040- 09:55.300* :  on many fronts, Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq. The enemy he said would have to wait for Hezbollah's
*09:55.300- 10:00.980* :  response. In Israel, the authorities are taking precautions, flights have been cancelled,
*10:00.980- 10:06.120* :  factories close to the Lebanese border ordered to close, and all public events in the city of
*10:06.120- 10:12.180* :  Haifa cancelled. People know that retaliation is likely, and that it may come in various forms.
*10:12.180- 10:19.400* :  This may not mean all-out war, but anxiety is palpable. Paul Adams. At the Olympics in Paris,
*10:19.400- 10:25.400* :  the Italian boxer Angela Carini says she withdrew from her well-to-weight bout with Imani Khalif
*10:25.680- 10:32.100* :  after just 46 seconds, because she said she had to preserve her life. Her Algerian opponent is
*10:32.100- 10:37.320* :  one of two athletes cleared by the International Olympics Committee to compete in women's boxing,
*10:37.320- 10:43.900* :  despite being disqualified during last year's Women's World Championship. Usports editor Dan Rowan
*10:43.900- 10:48.860* :  reports. Imani Khalif's first fight of these Paris Olympics was always going to be hugely
*10:48.860- 10:53.740* :  controversial. The Algerian was allowed to compete in the women's boxing competition against
*10:53.740- 10:59.020* :  Italian opponent Angela Carini, despite being disqualified from last year's World Championships,
*10:59.020- 11:04.780* :  for what the IOC says were elevated levels of testosterone. But an already divisive situation
*11:04.780- 11:10.760* :  quickly escalated. Having been punched in the face, a clearly distressed Carini abandoned the fight
*11:10.760- 11:16.120* :  after just 46 seconds, later explaining that she couldn't bear the pain and had to preserve her
*11:16.120- 11:22.500* :  life. But the row is set to intensify. Tomorrow Taiwan's Lin Yu Ting, who, like Khalif, competed
*11:22.500- 11:27.540* :  at the last Olympics, will also fight here, despite being stripped of a medal at last year's World
*11:27.540- 11:32.640* :  Championships, after failing agenda eligibility test. With the sport's Russia-led governing
*11:32.640- 11:36.600* :  body suspended, the International Olympic Committee is running the boxing competition,
*11:36.600- 11:41.900* :  and insists both fighters have met their eligibility rules. Algeria's Olympic Committee, meanwhile,
*11:41.900- 11:47.020* :  has condemned what it called unethical targeting and baseless attacks on Khalif, who's lost
*11:47.020- 11:52.800* :  nine times in a 55-year career. But with testosterone levels linked to muscle size and strength,
*11:52.800- 11:57.700* :  the fear is that a fighter could be badly hurt, and Carini's abandonment of her fight
*11:58.040- 12:03.200* :  will only reinforce mounting questions facing the IOC over inclusion, fairness, and safety.
*12:03.840- 12:04.540* :  Dan Ruin
*12:05.340- 12:10.640* :  The British Prime Minister, Cure Starmer, says measures will be introduced to tackle violent
*12:10.640- 12:15.180* :  disorder in parts of England, following a mass stabbing that took place in Southport
*12:15.180- 12:20.120* :  in the northwest of the country on Monday. Speaking at a news conference, the Prime Minister said
*12:20.120- 12:25.460* :  scenes of unrest were not protests, but crime being driven by far-right hatred.
*12:26.200- 12:30.500* :  It is obvious to me, I think, obvious to anybody looking in, that far as the far-right is concerned,
*12:30.500- 12:37.280* :  this is coordinated, this is deliberate, this is not a protest that has gone out of hand,
*12:37.280- 12:42.720* :  it is a group of individuals who are absolutely bent on violence. That's why it's important,
*12:42.720- 12:47.960* :  I think, to pull together the senior police and law enforcement leaders as we did today
*12:48.660- 12:54.440* :  to ensure that that is met with the most robust response in the coming days and weeks.
*12:55.020- 13:00.340* :  On Thursday morning, the teenager charged with the murder of three girls and attempted murder
*13:00.340- 13:07.060* :  of others at a dance class appeared in court. He was named as Axel Rara Cubana, a reporter
*13:07.060- 13:13.060* :  will Vernon is in Southport. Until today, we weren't naming the suspect because he's underage,
*13:13.060- 13:18.940* :  he's 17 years old, but he'll be 18 in just six days. That was one of the reasons the
*13:18.940- 13:24.740* :  judge at Liverpool Crown Court today decided not to impose restrictions. The other reason the judge
*13:24.740- 13:30.480* :  took this step was because he said it would prevent the spread of misinformation in a vacuum,
*13:30.480- 13:35.900* :  because the police fear that a lot of violent disorder we've seen in the last few days.
*13:36.460- 13:42.620* :  There's been a riot in Southport on Tuesday night, that was one day after the stabbing,
*13:42.620- 13:48.240* :  in the last 24 hours, there's been violent disorder unrest in other places around the UK too,
*13:48.240- 13:54.460* :  and the police think that these are linked to false claims on social media that the perpetrator
*13:54.460- 14:00.380* :  of this attack was a Muslim or an illegal immigrant. So Mr. Rida Cubana today in court,
*14:00.380- 14:05.140* :  he was reminded in custody of a waiting trial, so the next court date will be in October.
*14:05.400- 14:12.320* :  The other thing we heard in court today was that Mr. Rida Cubana, the defendant, he has an
*14:12.320- 14:18.340* :  autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, and that he had been unwilling to leave the house and communicate
*14:18.340- 14:25.900* :  with family for a period of time. Now, the main question among people here in Southport is why
*14:25.900- 14:33.020* :  this happened? What led this person to go into a dance studio during the summer holidays and
*14:33.020- 14:38.480* :  start stabbing, attacking little children? Will Vernon?
*14:41.140- 14:46.060* :  Still to come, the first underwater expedition to the Titanic is taking place,
*14:46.060- 14:52.460* :  following the implosion of the submersible Titan. As we now know, we lived in false hope for four days,
*14:52.940- 14:57.620* :  and the one regaining thing that we can say is that at least we know they didn't suffer.
*15:05.220- 15:09.620* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies
*15:09.620- 15:14.440* :  are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising
*15:14.440- 15:19.460* :  prices technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking
*15:19.460- 15:24.100* :  about? You insane Hollywood s**t. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited
*15:24.100- 15:29.540* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month. Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.

*16:11.880- 16:15.780* :  In security and violence in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo,
*16:15.780- 16:20.540* :  has led to one of the world's worst and least reported humanitarian crisis.
*16:20.540- 16:26.120* :  Many thousands have been killed and hundreds of thousands more have been forced to flee their homes.
*16:26.120- 16:31.820* :  But now there appears to be a major breakthrough. The foreign ministers of the DRC in Rwanda
*16:31.820- 16:36.080* :  have agreed to cease fire. We heard more from our reporter Richard Hamilton.
*16:36.580- 16:42.040* :  The talks have been held in Lwanda, the Angolan capital, in the presidential palace because
*16:42.040- 16:49.500* :  they were mediated by President Zhao Lorenzo. They come as a humanitarian truce between the Congolese
*16:49.500- 16:55.500* :  Army and the rebel group, the M23, who is due to expire on the 3rd of August.
*16:55.500- 17:02.400* :  So it's not immediately clear if this ceasefire extends that truce or whether it has a wider scope.
*17:02.400- 17:07.320* :  So we do have to be a bit cautious and previous agreements have collapsed.
*17:08.080- 17:13.740* :  But if it holds, this could be a massive deal. Rwanda in the past has denied supporting the
*17:13.740- 17:21.540* :  M23, but the United Nations has in a report said that Kigali funded the group and Rwanda
*17:21.540- 17:27.600* :  forces have also been accused of operating inside the DR Congo alongside the rebels.
*17:28.200- 17:35.560* :  Now this all goes back to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda when Hutu militia escaped across the
*17:35.560- 17:42.740* :  border into the DR Congo, which was then Zaire. Rwanda in turn armed militias to use them as a
*17:42.740- 17:49.920* :  buffer to protect the Tutsi population and to avoid a repeat of the genocide. The M23 was created
*17:50.620- 17:58.640* :  in 2012 and it re-emerged in 2021. They took the provincial capital Goma in the past and at the
*17:58.640- 18:05.300* :  moment the control nearby towns. So tens of thousands have been killed and up to half a million
*18:05.300- 18:12.580* :  displaced in the last few years. So a massive potential deal that's already been welcomed by Belgium,
*18:12.580- 18:18.920* :  the former colonial power. Richard Hamilton. The Bangladeshi government has banned the country's
*18:18.920- 18:24.600* :  main Islamist party, the Jammat Islami and its student wing from all political activities.
*18:24.920- 18:30.020* :  And notifications said they were prescribed under the Anti-Terrorism Act. And Barasson
*18:30.020- 18:36.060* :  Etheragin reports. A leader of the Jammat had earlier described the move to ban them as illegal,
*18:36.060- 18:42.900* :  extrajudicial and unconstitutional. The party was effectively barred from taking part in elections
*18:42.900- 18:50.660* :  in 2013 after a court ruling that its registration as a political party conflicted with Bangladesh's
*18:50.660- 18:56.920* :  secular constitution. In the meantime, police have released from custody six student leaders who
*18:56.920- 19:03.140* :  were leading demonstrations against job quotas in civil service jobs. They were detained last week
*19:03.140- 19:09.540* :  with police claiming the detention was for their own safety. And Barasson Etheragin.
*19:10.540- 19:17.280* :  September 11, 2001 is a date when many remember exactly where they were at the time.
*19:32.440- 19:37.540* :  Nearly 3,000 people died following the 9, 11 attacks on the United States
*19:37.540- 19:44.420* :  when teams of suicide attackers hijacked four passenger jets. Two crashed into the Twin
*19:44.420- 19:49.300* :  Towers of the World Trade Center in New York, one hit the U.S. Defense Department building in
*19:49.300- 19:55.680* :  Washington, and another crash landed in Pennsylvania. On Wednesday, the U.S. Defense Department said
*19:55.680- 20:01.940* :  three Guantanamo Bay detainees, including Khaled Sheikh Mohammed accused of plotting the attacks,
*20:02.420- 20:08.240* :  agreed to plead to conspiracy and murder charges. In return for assurances, they won't face
*20:08.240- 20:14.020* :  the death penalty. The attacks were carried out by Al Qaeda, a network of his limouset extremists
*20:14.020- 20:20.620* :  led by Asama bin Laden, and sparked what became known as America's war on terror and the invasions
*20:20.620- 20:27.460* :  of both Afghanistan and Iraq. James Menendez spoke to Terry Rockefeller, who lost her sister Laura in
*20:27.460- 20:33.740* :  the attacks and asked what she thought of the plea deal. I think the plea agreements have been
*20:33.740- 20:41.300* :  a long time coming, and they are truly the only way that 9, 11 families like me would have
*20:41.920- 20:50.120* :  seen any justice and accountability for the crimes of 9, 11. I have followed the hearings at Guantanamo
*20:51.160- 20:59.460* :  since the arrangement in 2012, and after five years, I was convinced that the government was never
*20:59.460- 21:06.600* :  going to be able to conduct a trial, because we believed plea agreements did hold out a real
*21:06.600- 21:15.180* :  opportunity for us to learn what happened on 9, 11. I can't emphasize how painful it has been
*21:15.600- 21:24.920* :  to be living 23 years after my sister was murdered, and to fear that I would die before there
*21:24.920- 21:29.500* :  was justice. And why will it give you that closure? And why will it give you the answers that you
*21:29.500- 21:36.200* :  want, given that there's unlikely to be a full trial where much of this can be heard in open
*21:36.200- 21:43.020* :  court? Well, what you have to understand is that what's going on at Guantanamo is not in any way
*21:43.020- 21:50.240* :  shape or form related to the kinds of trials we have in here in the United States in federal court.
*21:51.000- 21:56.900* :  And what there will be is a sentencing hearing. We, as victim family members, have been assured
*21:56.900- 22:03.640* :  by the prosecution that questions can be put to the defendants. What would, if you were given
*22:03.640- 22:11.420* :  one question to put the defendants, what would it be? Why did you do what you did? Let me just
*22:11.420- 22:21.600* :  say further that what these plea agreements offer is the absolute assurance that the sentences
*22:21.600- 22:29.560* :  cannot be appealed. Had there been a trial, the convictions would have been appealed to federal court.
*22:29.960- 22:37.060* :  And that could have easily taken additional years. And that would have extended your
*22:37.060- 22:44.800* :  language even further. And, you know, yesterday, when I heard the announcement, I held in my
*22:44.800- 22:52.140* :  heart the family members I have known who didn't live to see this moment. And I'm thinking that now,
*22:52.220- 22:59.720* :  with the sentencing hearings that we're told, we are told, will likely happen this summer, that I
*22:59.900- 23:09.480* :  will see finality, judicial finality. And my most fervent hope is this nation never again betrays
*23:09.480- 23:15.440* :  its values and tortures people. And are you angry about that, about the way this has been handled
*23:15.460- 23:26.020* :  and the methods used to interrogate the defendants? It goes beyond anger. It goes its shame and grief.
*23:27.480- 23:28.340* :  Terri Rockefeller.
*23:29.360- 23:34.820* :  Carol Rosenberg is a journalist with a New York Times. She's currently in Guantanamo Bay, the US
*23:34.820- 23:40.080* :  naval base on Cuba, where the men are being held and is reported on the facility there for two
*23:40.080- 23:46.340* :  decades. So, what more does she know about the deal? It's been about 27 months in the making.
*23:46.340- 23:51.460* :  They started right after the return to work from the coronavirus shutdown and hit many stumbling
*23:51.460- 23:57.200* :  blocks along the way, including the White House's unwillingness to participate with and meet some
*23:57.200- 24:01.720* :  of the demands. But yesterday, we learned that there is a secret agreement that did not involve
*24:01.720- 24:07.540* :  the White House that was strictly between the military prosecutors and three of the five men who
*24:07.540- 24:13.460* :  have been accused of plotting the 9-11 attacks. And what will it entail exactly? Well, later today,
*24:13.460- 24:17.940* :  it should entail them coming into court and putting it on the record in front of their military
*24:17.940- 24:23.140* :  judge that they have indeed signed these agreements, and then the judge decides whether the plea
*24:23.140- 24:28.860* :  is, as they call it, prominent in the military. From that point on, a process that would roll out in
*24:28.860- 24:34.420* :  months will involve putting together a military jury. The death penalty is off the table, as they say.
*24:34.420- 24:40.400* :  The key part of this plead agreement is that there will be no capital punishment as the ultimate
*24:40.400- 24:45.360* :  punishment. The ultimate punishment would be life in prison without possibility of release.
*24:45.360- 24:52.520* :  That many months process will also involve family members of those who were killed coming down
*24:52.520- 24:58.780* :  to Guantanamo Bay and speaking about their loss. If it's not excluded by the agreement, it could
*24:58.780- 25:04.220* :  also include evidence about the men's torture in the three years they were held by the CIA.
*25:04.600- 25:11.060* :  Yeah, and that last point, people listening, maybe thinking, why on earth is this all taken so many
*25:11.060- 25:16.860* :  years? Is it those allegations that the men were tortured to extract confessions that has
*25:17.040- 25:21.500* :  essentially stopped this going to a full trial? Absolutely. You know, when they were captured in
*25:21.500- 25:27.260* :  Pakistan in 2003, the Bush administration made a decision. They did not take them to New York City
*25:27.720- 25:34.300* :  and put them into the regular legal process to face US criminal justice. They took them to the
*25:34.300- 25:40.460* :  black sites, the secret prisons, and they interrogated them using brutal brutal techniques, including
*25:40.460- 25:47.800* :  sleep deprivation, waterboarding, forced nudity. This case has focused for the last dozen years
*25:47.800- 25:53.660* :  on what information about that time period has been able to be surfaced. Given all that, why
*25:53.660- 25:59.020* :  then was the Biden administration opposed to a plea deal? What were its objections?
*25:59.440- 26:05.020* :  The Biden administration was asked to meet certain conditions that the defendants, the men wanted.
*26:05.020- 26:10.000* :  They wanted the administration to agree that they would have continuing contacts with their lawyers
*26:10.000- 26:14.540* :  and the Biden administration said we are not participating in this. This is a process that
*26:14.540- 26:21.060* :  belongs in the courts. Journalist Carol Rosenberg. For several days in June last year, there was
*26:21.060- 26:26.960* :  hope that five people on board, a titan submersible, which went missing on route to explore the sunken
*26:26.960- 26:32.760* :  wreck of the Titanic, would be found alive. Nocking signs were heard that might have come from the
*26:32.760- 26:38.760* :  ocean gate sub, but when it was located, the vessel had imploded. For those on board, the mothership
*26:38.760- 26:44.460* :  at the surface, the weight was excruciating. Rory Golden was on the expedition, and our
*26:44.460- 26:49.900* :  science editor, Rebecca Morel, spoke to him before he set sail on the first trip to the side of
*26:49.900- 26:55.780* :  the Titanic, since the Titan sub-disaster. The headlines this morning are huge searches underway
*26:55.780- 27:00.520* :  in the North Atlantic for a mini submarine. The news last June of a missing submersible,
*27:00.520- 27:04.900* :  with five people on board at the site of the Titanic, grabbed the world's attention.
*27:05.860- 27:10.480* :  For those on the sub-support ship, the Polar Prince, it was a start of days of anguish.
*27:21.080- 27:25.340* :  Rory Golden was on the ocean gate expedition, giving presentations about the Titanic.
*27:26.140- 27:30.800* :  After the titan submersible went missing, a major search and rescue operation was launched.
*27:36.000- 27:41.000* :  A few days in, sounds of banging were detected underwater, raising hope that they were from the
*27:41.000- 27:47.520* :  vessel, but Titan had imploded just a few hours into its dive. The one redeeming thing that we
*27:47.520- 27:51.900* :  can say is that, at least we know they didn't suffer, because we had this image in our heads
*27:52.640- 27:58.220* :  of them being down there running out of oxygen in the freezing cold, getting terribly frightened
*27:58.220- 28:03.420* :  and scared. Those who perished were British explorer, Hamish Harding. The British Pakistani
*28:03.420- 28:06.220* :  businessman, Zada Dawid and his son, Suleiman,
*28:06.640- 28:10.960* :  stocked him rushed the CEO of Ocean Gate and French diver, P.H. Norgile.
*28:11.440- 28:18.980* :  And he was a very special man, very generous and as imparting of knowledge of what he knew about
*28:19.940- 28:23.820* :  the Titanic. Rory Golden was a close friend of P.H. Norgile.
*28:24.320- 28:29.240* :  I was one of the last to see him. He left the ship in great spirits and great form,
*28:29.320- 28:33.280* :  and he was happy out. He was going to somewhere that he wants it to be.
*28:34.100- 28:40.100* :  Rory is now on the first expedition to the Titanic since Titan. It was an expedition P.H.
*28:40.100- 28:44.520* :  was supposed to lead. Now a plaque is being laid at the rec site to honour him.
*28:45.360- 28:48.500* :  Rory had also visited the Titanic on the Titan sub.
*28:48.980- 28:56.100* :  I made a dive two years ago. One was on the Ocean Gate expeditions and I'm here.
*28:57.020- 29:03.740* :  I mean, what do you think now about going in the sub? Do you, I mean, do you wish you had it,
*29:03.740- 29:07.560* :  or do you? No, I don't wish that at all. Does it not make you look back and think,
*29:07.580- 29:12.200* :  oh, I was lucky that it was okay? Yes, I was. It wasn't my time, you know.
*29:12.440- 29:17.820* :  So, life is precious. You never know when your time is going to come and that certainly brought
*29:17.820- 29:24.380* :  that home to all of us. Industry experts had raised many questions about the safety of the sub
*29:24.560- 29:29.160* :  and an investigation is still ongoing. It's likely to call for changes to ensure
*29:29.160- 29:32.760* :  such a tragedy doesn't happen again. Rebecca Morrell.
*29:34.040- 29:39.320* :  After tears and a standing ovation, Britain's Andy Murray has ended his tennis career with the
*29:39.320- 29:45.100* :  defeat in the quarterfinals of the men's doubles at the Paris Olympics. The 37-year-old,
*29:45.100- 29:49.400* :  speaking after the match, said he'd been ready for the moment for the last few months.
*29:50.040- 29:53.720* :  The BBC's Schurger Sarkar reflects on Andy Murray's career.
*29:54.480- 29:59.720* :  He will forever be celebrated as the man who fulfilled a national sporting obsession.
*30:00.380- 30:05.040* :  The gentlemen's singles title at Wimbledon had not been won by a British player for 77 years
*30:05.680- 30:09.720* :  until Andy Murray delivered on a warm sunny July day in 2013.
*30:10.160- 30:16.720* :  It's famous old centre-court could be about to go crazy. Murray serves. Here it is. Here it is.
*30:16.880- 30:18.820* :  Full hand from Murray. Backhand from Jockeville.
*30:18.820- 30:19.240* :  Here it is.
*30:19.240- 30:20.500* :  That's the man. Murray.
*30:20.820- 30:21.540* :  Murray's the winner.
*30:21.540- 30:22.400* :  Jockeville.
*30:23.120- 30:27.240* :  A prodigious talent had broken through tennis's glass ceiling, but it had been coming.
*30:27.240- 30:31.720* :  Murray had won the US Open the Year before. There were five other grand slam finals.
*30:31.720- 30:37.560* :  There was also Olympic gold at London 2012. For a period of eight years, Murray was revered as
*30:37.560- 30:43.760* :  one of the fab four of tennis in a band with the greatest names of all. Federer, Nadal, Jockevich.
*30:44.240- 30:49.340* :  And the magic didn't stop. He led Great Britain to a first Davis Cup title in 79 years.
*30:49.800- 30:55.880* :  In 2016, a second Wimbledon title followed, another Olympic gold in Rio, and the coveted world
*30:55.880- 30:56.760* :  number one ranking.
*30:56.960- 31:03.720* :  It's taken a lot of work this year to do it. I certainly was very far away in a second half
*31:03.720- 31:08.460* :  of the year after the French Open's been in the best of my career, and you know, really happy.
*31:08.460- 31:09.260* :  I managed to do it.
*31:09.440- 31:12.040* :  But then came a long, cruel struggle with injuries.
*31:12.600- 31:16.840* :  And despite the determination to play on with a metal hip, Murray couldn't quite reach the heights
*31:16.840- 31:22.520* :  of the past. At Wimbledon last month, he finally admitted that his body just could not do it anymore.
*31:22.800- 31:27.920* :  I would love to keep playing, but I can't, you know, physically it's just too tough and I,
*31:28.960- 31:33.460* :  you know, all of the injuries have, you know, they've added up. And like I said, they haven't been
*31:33.960- 31:38.840* :  insignificant, but yeah, I want to play forever. I love, I love the sport.
*31:39.640- 31:44.720* :  Andy Murray will be remembered, not just as a tennis great, but an all-time British sporting
*31:45.000- 31:45.020* :  great.
