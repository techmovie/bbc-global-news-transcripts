*01:25.320- 01:31.340* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Sunday, the 18th of August, these are our main stories.
*01:31.920- 01:38.140* :  The Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Carina Machado has called on protesters to remain out in
*01:38.140- 01:44.180* :  force as fresh demonstrations take place against Nicholas Maduro being declared the winner of the
*01:44.180- 01:49.820* :  recent presidential election. The UN's nuclear watchdog says the safety situation at these
*01:49.820- 01:54.040* :  apparition nuclear power plant in Russian occupied Ukraine is deteriorating,
*01:54.040- 01:59.620* :  following a drone strike near its perimeter. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office says
*01:59.620- 02:05.300* :  Israeli negotiators have expressed cautious optimism about the possibility of reaching a
*02:05.300- 02:14.440* :  deal with Hamas on Gaza. Also in this podcast, any woman in India has faced this sort of things
*02:14.440- 02:20.600* :  at any level, be it as small as cat calling to getting sexually assaulted or raped.
*02:21.000- 02:27.300* :  Non-emergency hospital care in India is halted by a 24 hour strike in process at the murders
*02:27.800- 02:33.620* :  of a doctor and a nurse. A recently qualified doctor tells us how vulnerable she and many other
*02:33.620- 02:49.260* :  women feel. Let's begin in Venezuela. That's the sound of opposition leader Maria Carina Machado,
*02:49.260- 02:54.360* :  a top-of-campaign truck joining thousands of protesters on these streets of Caracas.
*02:54.360- 03:00.700* :  She spent most of the last month in hiding contesting the declared results of July's presidential
*03:00.700- 03:06.920* :  election. The electoral council named Nicholas Maduro the winner again, but the opposition says
*03:06.920- 03:13.020* :  it won and the United States, the European Union and some countries in the region also reject Mr.
*03:13.020- 03:19.180* :  Maduro's victory claim. Mrs. Machado told her supporters they were not going to leave the streets.
*03:19.180- 03:25.240* :  Edmund Doe Gonzalez, the opposition's candidate, says Mr. Maduro cannot ignore the will of
*03:25.240- 03:34.980* :  Venezuelans. Instead of preparing democratically for a peaceful transition, the regime has decided
*03:34.980- 03:40.720* :  to persecute imprisoned and murder compatriots who have only demanded for the majority will to be
*03:40.720- 03:47.380* :  respected. It's time for an orderly transition. I got more from Anna Arreiro, an investigative journalist
*03:47.380- 03:54.080* :  based in Caracas. Those thousands of police men and military were not deployed in the central
*03:54.080- 04:01.360* :  areas of Caracas where thousands met with Maria Carina Machado, but inside and deep inside
*04:01.700- 04:07.180* :  the working class neighborhoods. Because let's not forget that after the elections,
*04:07.180- 04:13.740* :  these were the neighborhoods that started protesting against the results announced by the
*04:13.740- 04:19.420* :  electoral council close to Maduro. So yes, thousands were there. People told me in the
*04:19.420- 04:25.200* :  streets that they were scared that they understood the rest, but they were still going to do it until
*04:25.200- 04:31.720* :  Maduro accepted the results. The protests not just in Caracas, but all over Venezuela.
*04:32.340- 04:38.500* :  All over Venezuela, all over the world. In different parts of the world, people started showing up
*04:38.540- 04:44.520* :  with the tallies, what we call the access in Spanish, the results that the opposition showed.
*04:44.560- 04:50.900* :  And still in Venezuela here, people were going, you know, out to the streets to protest peacefully
*04:50.900- 04:57.600* :  with this tallies in hand, asking the government to recognize the results. And in other parts,
*04:57.820- 05:04.920* :  outside of Caracas, repression started quickly. We know now of several tensions in different
*05:04.920- 05:10.780* :  parts in Maracay, in SÃºlia, in Amazonas. Different people were arrested, and well, they're part
*05:10.780- 05:16.740* :  of the thousands that have been arrested so far. The opposition say they will not stop these
*05:16.740- 05:25.280* :  protests until Maduro releases the detailed results of the election. Could he bow down
*05:25.320- 05:30.600* :  to that pressure? Well, that's not going to happen anytime soon. We don't expect that
*05:30.600- 05:36.040* :  Nicolas Maduro is going to show any results. We're still waiting not only for the tallies,
*05:36.040- 05:41.300* :  we're waiting for the results stayed by state. This is the first time that this has happened in
*05:41.300- 05:46.980* :  Venezuela after presidential elections, after any elections, really. So we don't expect that
*05:46.980- 05:54.560* :  happening. We do expect, though, that the Supreme Court will show the results that they have,
*05:54.560- 05:58.360* :  but let's not forget that the Supreme Court, as well as the electoral council,
*05:58.360- 06:04.820* :  is extremely close to Nicolas Maduro. So the opposition is warning everyone not to believe what
*06:04.820- 06:08.420* :  the Supreme Court will say, and we're expecting that anytime soon.
*06:08.660- 06:15.180* :  Journalist Anna Arerro in Caracas. There's mounting concern over the safety of Europe's biggest
*06:15.180- 06:21.020* :  nuclear plant after what appears to have been a drone strike close to its perimeter. The International
*06:21.020- 06:26.700* :  Atomic Energy Agency says conditions at these apparition at nuclear power plant close to the
*06:26.700- 06:32.380* :  frontline in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine are deteriorating. I heard more from our correspondent
*06:32.380- 06:41.340* :  Bethany Bell in Vienna. The IAA's team that stationed at Zapparizia say they went to the site of the
*06:41.340- 06:49.200* :  impact, which was on a road just outside the plant. They said it was very close to essential
*06:49.200- 06:57.620* :  water sprinkling ponds, and just about a hundred metres away from the last high-voltage line
*06:57.620- 07:06.440* :  that supplies power to the plant. They said that it seems to have been caused the damage by a drone
*07:06.440- 07:13.080* :  that was carrying an explosive, and it said there were no casualties or impact to the plant's
*07:13.080- 07:18.820* :  equipment, but obviously this is much too close for comfort. How bad is the damage?
*07:19.140- 07:23.900* :  We know there's damage on the road. They didn't go into the detail of the actual damage of the
*07:23.940- 07:30.660* :  site there, but of course if it had hit closer to the plant, or in the plant itself, then that would
*07:30.660- 07:37.680* :  have been a very concerning situation. The head of the agency Rafael Grossi has called for maximum
*07:37.680- 07:43.540* :  restraint from all sides, and he said that nuclear power plants are designed to be resilient
*07:43.580- 07:50.480* :  against technical or human failures, but they're not built to withstand direct military attacks.
*07:51.000- 07:58.120* :  Drone attacks can be carried out with enormous precision. It is possible this wasn't an accident,
*07:58.120- 08:06.260* :  isn't it? The IAA isn't commenting on that. They've also not commented on who carried out the strike,
*08:07.020- 08:14.720* :  but they have warned repeatedly about the dangers facing the plant, given the military activity
*08:14.720- 08:20.900* :  that is happening. We also heard from the IAA today that military activity in the area
*08:21.620- 08:26.600* :  has been very intense for the last week, including very close to the plant.
*08:27.120- 08:33.900* :  Its team there says it's heard explosions, it's heard repetitive, heavy machine gun and rifle
*08:33.900- 08:42.020* :  fire, artillery at various distances from the plant, and despite the calls to be careful
*08:42.020- 08:47.700* :  around the plant, they say there's no sign that the military activity around it is abating.
*08:48.220- 08:55.020* :  How serious could this be if something did go wrong? Any fighting around a nuclear plant is
*08:55.020- 09:01.840* :  something which the IAA has repeatedly said is extremely dangerous, and there are of course
*09:01.960- 09:08.540* :  those in Ukraine who will remember the terrible nuclear accident at Chernobyl. The agency has
*09:09.000- 09:14.440* :  not suggested that drone attacks could cause the kind of damage that Chernobyl did,
*09:14.440- 09:22.500* :  but certainly there is enormous concern about military activity close or act a nuclear power plant.
*09:22.500- 09:28.040* :  This is something that the agency has repeatedly said there has to be maximum restraint that
*09:28.040- 09:31.600* :  they are not built to withstand direct military attacks.
*09:31.940- 09:36.700* :  Anthony Bell. Elsewhere on the battlefield, Kiev's forces continued their
*09:36.700- 09:42.360* :  incursion into Russian territory, with Ukraine's army chief saying on Saturday that his troops had
*09:42.360- 09:48.140* :  advanced as much as four kilometers east over the past 24 hours. General David Petraeus,
*09:48.140- 09:54.820* :  their US forces in Iraq, as well as NATO coalition forces in Afghanistan, he then went on to be
*09:54.820- 10:01.720* :  director of the CIA. He told Caroline Wyatt what he made of the Ukrainian move and the Russian
*10:01.720- 10:08.160* :  response. I think they underestimated the amount of combat power that the Ukrainians had and
*10:08.160- 10:13.220* :  overestimated the ability of their border forces and their national guard and police to respond
*10:13.220- 10:19.320* :  to this. The Ukrainians have captured hundreds and hundreds of Russian soldiers, very, very helpful
*10:19.320- 10:26.780* :  for later prisoner exchanges. They have interdicted a key rail line. It's very important. The Russians
*10:26.780- 10:33.720* :  use railroads extensively. This is almost exclusively to move armored forces around in the logistics
*10:33.720- 10:38.380* :  and so forth. Then the key line that connects Moscow with south-eastern Ukraine, the forces in
*10:38.380- 10:43.280* :  south-eastern Ukraine, goes through this area and the Ukrainians now control it. This is not
*10:43.280- 10:48.500* :  unlike when we did the invasion of Iraq and you know a great armored brigade did the thunder run
*10:48.500- 10:52.980* :  through Baghdad and ends up at the airfield and they said, hey, we're just going to stay here.
*10:53.080- 10:57.460* :  Let's develop this situation. Let's see what happens from here. How does the enemy respond?
*10:58.380- 11:04.340* :  And so forth. And I think that's where they are. I'm sure they are concerned about being cut off.
*11:05.020- 11:09.760* :  And so they've got to work their flanks very, very acidiously and sure that the Russians can't
*11:10.600- 11:16.420* :  seal the border behind them and trap them inside Russia, which would be catastrophic.
*11:17.680- 11:22.580* :  And so they're assessing the risks they're trying to determine what the Russians are doing and
*11:22.580- 11:29.400* :  this would still a somewhat disorganized response. And is there, do you think, or was that behind this
*11:29.400- 11:36.220* :  a sense in Kiev that time was running out that by next year allies like the US might be growing
*11:36.220- 11:41.160* :  tired of this war, wishing it to end as soon as possible because Donald Trump could of course be
*11:41.160- 11:46.580* :  US president. Germany might well cut its bilateral military aid to Ukraine during its own election
*11:46.580- 11:51.980* :  year next year. Yeah, I don't expect that with Germany. The US is somewhat unknown and the
*11:51.980- 11:57.320* :  predictability factor there is a little bit difficult. But I think it's again a bit of all the above.
*11:57.520- 12:03.160* :  They saw an opportunity. This is an enormous psychological blow against Russia and
*12:03.700- 12:09.140* :  morale boost for Ukraine, which has literally been on the defensive since the offensive last summer
*12:09.140- 12:15.020* :  that didn't achieve what we hoped that it would. And again, they're now seeing what else they can do.
*12:15.020- 12:20.800* :  This could change, we've always talked about needing to change the dynamic so that you could actually
*12:20.800- 12:26.860* :  have some kind of meaningful discussions about how to bring about a ceasefire. And I think it's probably
*12:27.440- 12:32.380* :  that is another factor here. I'll be there in a few weeks in September and I'll tell you what
*12:32.380- 12:35.660* :  the census is when I'm there. General David Patriot.
*12:38.260- 12:46.040* :  Still to come. Last year in Glasgow, the UV index hit seven for about 10 minutes in the whole year,
*12:46.260- 12:52.140* :  and yet we are basing our advice on the advice for white Australians. It's ridiculous.
*12:52.660- 12:58.220* :  Why new research suggests that some public health messages about the risks of sunlight are wrong.
*13:06.840- 13:11.820* :  Your wedding will be one of the happiest days of your life, and Blue Nile can help you celebrate it

*13:41.000- 13:46.040* :  companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if
*13:46.040- 13:50.920* :  raising prices technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you
*13:50.920- 13:55.880* :  talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited

*14:13.560- 14:19.200* :  On Friday, President Biden said that a ceasefire in Gaza tied to the release of Israeli hostages
*14:19.860- 14:25.760* :  was closer than ever. 24 hours on, and the Office of the Israeli Prime Minister Ben Jumin Netanyahu
*14:25.760- 14:32.260* :  said that his negotiators have expressed cautious optimism about the possibility of a ceasefire.
*14:32.600- 14:38.740* :  Talks ended in Qatar on Friday, and are expected to resume in Cairo next week, as we record
*14:38.740- 14:45.240* :  this podcast. The US Secretary of State, Anthony Binken, is due in Israel for talks with Mr Netanyahu.
*14:45.600- 14:51.420* :  It's hoped a ceasefire will stop Iran retaliating against Israel after a Hamas leader was
*14:51.420- 14:57.860* :  assassinated in Tehran, and prevent a war between its ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah, and Israel.
*14:58.420- 15:03.940* :  Our senior international correspondent, Alla Geren, is in Beirut, and I asked her about the chances
*15:03.940- 15:09.860* :  of a deal. Well, we're getting a lot of conflicting narratives. We've had the Israeli negotiating
*15:09.860- 15:16.460* :  team talking about cautious optimism about the possibility of progress. But critically,
*15:16.460- 15:23.000* :  perhaps we have Hamas, the militant group in charge in Gaza, pouring cold water on all of that,
*15:23.020- 15:28.300* :  saying that the Americans are being overly optimistic, that they are selling illusions,
*15:28.480- 15:34.980* :  that they are trying to buy time. A Hamas official told the BBC that, in fact, during the two days
*15:34.980- 15:40.500* :  of talks in Doha, no progress was made, and that the proposals they had received
*15:41.160- 15:47.440* :  from the mediators were very disappointing. Now, this could be posturing, or it could be that
*15:47.440- 15:53.720* :  the two sides remain very far apart. We know they have been given a bridging proposal, what's
*15:53.720- 16:00.500* :  been described as a bridging proposal, from the US. But at this stage, beyond some positive
*16:00.500- 16:06.600* :  statements from the US and positive noises from Israel, there is absolutely no indication
*16:06.700- 16:13.840* :  that any concrete progress has been made. And I think there is a speculation in some quarters
*16:13.840- 16:20.100* :  that the mediators and particularly the US are desperately trying to create the appearance of
*16:20.100- 16:26.500* :  progress, trying to keep the wheels on this thing. I think also both sides, we have to bear in mind,
*16:26.500- 16:32.900* :  will be very keen not to get the blame. Neither one will want to be blamed if these talks fail,
*16:32.900- 16:38.020* :  as many fear they will. Because there's a huge amount at stake, well, for the whole region really,
*16:38.020- 16:43.180* :  isn't there a piece at this time would be very welcome by a lot of people. Well, there's a massive
*16:43.180- 16:49.180* :  amount at stake, first and foremost, in Gaza, where it's a matter of life and death for Palestinian
*16:49.180- 16:55.200* :  civilians. But it's also critical for the rest of the region, because getting a truth in Gaza
*16:55.900- 17:02.480* :  is central to trying to de-escalate, not just between Israel and Gaza, but, for example, with Iran,
*17:03.080- 17:10.040* :  Iran has threatened to hit back hard against Israel for the killing on its soil of the Hamas leader
*17:10.040- 17:17.120* :  Ismail Haneer. Now, that retaliation has not come yet. Iran said that getting a cease-fire in Gaza
*17:17.120- 17:23.120* :  was crucial. It said it didn't want the timing of its retaliation to interfere with that. So,
*17:23.120- 17:29.520* :  in effect, what we have seen is Tehran holding back. Has Bala have also been holding back on
*17:29.520- 17:35.300* :  the retaliation they threatened, following Israel's assassination of one of their senior commanders
*17:35.300- 17:41.520* :  here in Beirut last month. So, the prospect of a deal, the possibility of a deal, has been acting
*17:41.520- 17:48.160* :  as a break, if you like. Now, if the talks collapse, there is certainly a risk that Tehran and
*17:48.160- 17:54.260* :  his Bala will feel freer. To go ahead with that harsh retaliation, they have threatened against Israel
*17:54.300- 18:01.080* :  when they see fit. And, of course, if and when that happens, Israel will retaliate, and we will be in
*18:01.080- 18:07.800* :  this very dangerous cycle of escalation, which could accelerate towards an all-out regional war,
*18:07.800- 18:10.680* :  and that's what the mediators are desperately trying to avoid.
*18:11.200- 18:17.360* :  All are garrin. Earlier, Hasbala fired more than 50 rockets into northern Israel after an Israeli
*18:17.360- 18:23.700* :  strike on a building in the southern Lebanese city of Nabatia. Where Adavis has more on this,
*18:23.700- 18:29.740* :  and the latest from Gaza. In Gaza, an overnight Israeli air strike
*18:29.740- 18:36.120* :  reportedly killed 15 people in the central area of the Palestinian territory. Although Israel said
*18:36.460- 18:41.720* :  it had eliminated a number of armed fighters, several women and children were also reportedly
*18:41.720- 18:47.860* :  killed. What happened is that around one o'clock in the morning, three rockets hit directly
*18:47.860- 18:52.180* :  the house of this man and his family. There were many children and women inside,
*18:52.180- 18:59.020* :  mainly women, around 20 in total. To the north, deep inside Lebanon, the Israeli Air Force
*18:59.360- 19:03.940* :  said it had also struck Hasbala targets, including a weapon storage facility.
*19:03.940- 19:09.520* :  The porch from the scene said at least 10 people were killed, many of them Syrian refugees,
*19:09.520- 19:16.160* :  including a woman and her two children. This is an industrial area, a brick factory, slaughterhouse,
*19:16.160- 19:21.540* :  metal factory, aluminium factory and cow farm. It's an industrial and civilian area.
*19:21.720- 19:27.460* :  There's an urgency for the next round of talks to succeed amid fears that the conflicts in
*19:27.460- 19:34.220* :  Gaza and either side of Israel's northern border could escalate into a much wider regional war.
*19:35.180- 19:36.260* :  Where Adavis, now.
*19:44.780- 19:50.560* :  Doctors across India were on strike on Saturday, paralyzing all but emergency treatment in both
*19:50.560- 19:56.320* :  government, run hospitals and private ones. They were protesting at the lack of security for both
*19:56.320- 20:02.000* :  doctors and nurses. Last month, a nurse was raped and killed as she traveled home from private
*20:02.000- 20:09.060* :  hospital in Otorakand. Eight days ago, a 31-year-old doctor at a state run hospital in Kolkata was killed
*20:09.060- 20:14.800* :  as she took arrest during her shift. Her family believed her blooded body bore the signs of a gang
*20:14.860- 20:20.020* :  rape. One protest sign carried during a candlelit vigil overnight read,
*20:20.020- 20:26.000* :  hands that heal shouldn't bleed. The federal health ministry has promised to hold an inquiry into
*20:26.000- 20:32.880* :  hospital security. Dr Nandini Vagani took part in the demonstrations in Gujarat state,
*20:32.880- 20:39.340* :  where she works at the government run hospital in Ahmedabad. She told us why she felt she had to
*20:39.340- 20:46.760* :  protest. Any woman in India has faced like this sort of things at any level, be it as small as
*20:46.760- 20:53.720* :  cat calling or eve teasing to getting sexually assaulted or raped on the roads on the very roads
*20:53.720- 20:59.620* :  of India. All of this is very, very prevalent and then for this to happen at your own workplace
*21:00.320- 21:05.160* :  is very, very shocking as well because then where else are we safe, right? If not in our homes
*21:05.160- 21:11.500* :  or not in our roads, then not even at our workplace. And if I talk about particularly in my profession,
*21:11.500- 21:16.600* :  all the females that work with me be it nurses or any of the staff and even myself,
*21:16.600- 21:21.660* :  especially in government settings, what happens is that there is so much lack of infrastructure,
*21:21.680- 21:26.320* :  there is so much lack of human resource and even there is very, very less security.
*21:27.080- 21:33.320* :  So what happens is that we are very much outnumbered by the male patients or by our male colleagues
*21:33.320- 21:38.760* :  or just any males in general. And there would be instances where we would get a lot of
*21:38.960- 21:44.880* :  intoxicated patients, be it drugs or alcohol and there would be males who are much bigger than us.
*21:45.000- 21:51.500* :  And we would still be in a dressing room or a stitches room with them taking sutures and they would
*21:51.500- 21:59.400* :  be alone with us or be it even as small as how the male patients look at us. It's not with the
*21:59.400- 22:04.640* :  eyes of that this person is my doctor, but it's in the eyes of this is a woman and they would be
*22:04.640- 22:09.280* :  looking at you in a very different way. So I have myself also felt very uncomfortable.
*22:09.280- 22:15.540* :  There have been situations where we as women or nurses or all of us, we have been told this
*22:15.540- 22:20.860* :  that to wear certain kind of clothes in the hospital to talk in a certain way so that we avoid
*22:20.860- 22:26.260* :  the wrong attention and to make sure that we are not alone in words or we are not alone in corridors.
*22:26.800- 22:31.680* :  So I just want to be clear about this. Part of the advice you've been given is if there is a
*22:31.680- 22:36.860* :  problem you have to deal with it. So you have to dress in a certain way. You mustn't say things
*22:36.860- 22:42.640* :  that men might prime provocative. I mean some people might call that victim blaming. In other words,
*22:43.060- 22:47.820* :  putting the responsibility on the potential victim, not on the potential perpetrators, the men.
*22:48.300- 22:53.880* :  That's exactly what I'm talking about. Be it victim shaming or victim blaming. Both of these things
*22:53.880- 22:59.160* :  are very prevalent in India and these have been going on since years. Since childhood, we as
*22:59.160- 23:03.980* :  girls are taught not to wear certain kinds of clothes. We as girls are taught to talk in a certain
*23:03.980- 23:10.080* :  way, not to engage with the opposite sex. With the same way we talk with our female colleagues
*23:10.560- 23:15.080* :  because every time that a rape has occurred or every time some crime against women has occurred,
*23:15.500- 23:21.260* :  there will be one leader or one some important entity of a country who will say things like what
*23:21.260- 23:26.280* :  was she wearing? Or even in this case of this rape case, the questions that were raised on this
*23:26.640- 23:31.480* :  doctor were that what was she doing in that seminar hall so late in the night? Why was she not in
*23:31.480- 23:35.920* :  her hostel? Why was she not sleeping at her home? And such things were raised that why was she
*23:35.920- 23:41.380* :  alone there? So this is very prevalent and very common. What about the general wards which she
*23:41.380- 23:47.800* :  work in in a state-run hospital? Is there any kind of security? Generally, there would be one
*23:47.800- 23:54.120* :  security guard who would be sitting outside that ward but that I found in the previous hospital
*23:54.120- 23:59.120* :  where I graduated because it was a much bigger hospital but now the current hospital that where I
*23:59.120- 24:05.100* :  work, which is a bit of a rural area, there's just one security guard at the very gate of hospital.
*24:05.680- 24:12.780* :  Dr. Nandini Vagani talking to Sean Lay. Forensic anthropologists in the US state of Oklahoma
*24:12.780- 24:19.240* :  have announced the latest result of the autopsies of remains recovered from the Tulsa race massacre,
*24:19.800- 24:25.280* :  one of the deadliest in US history, 47 bodies have now been exhumed in the attempt to find and
*24:25.280- 24:32.460* :  identify those murdered and hidden over a century ago cat wiener reports. Investigators said
*24:32.460- 24:37.640* :  the bodies showed signs of gunshot wounds, one had also been burned, 300 black Americans
*24:37.640- 24:43.180* :  are estimated to have been killed on the night of 31st of May 1921 when a white mob attacked
*24:43.180- 24:48.320* :  Greenwood, a prosperous neighborhood of Tulsa known as the Black Wall Street. Holmes, shops,
*24:48.320- 24:53.220* :  churches and theatres were looted and then torched. By the morning Greenwood had been raised to the
*24:53.220- 24:57.960* :  ground, survivors were rounded up by the National Guard and heard it into internment camps.
*24:57.960- 25:03.700* :  The dead were buried in unmarked graves in Tulsa's Oak Lawn Cemetery where the current excavations
*25:03.700- 25:08.460* :  are taking place. For decades the massacre was little discussed with key documents destroyed.
*25:08.900- 25:16.240* :  Cat wiener. For years public health advice on the effects of sunlight here in the UK and Australia
*25:16.720- 25:22.200* :  has placed too much emphasis on the risks and not the benefits. That's the view of Richard
*25:22.200- 25:27.680* :  Weller, professor of dermatology at the University of Edinburgh who is trying to redress the balance.
*25:27.680- 25:33.000* :  He's published new research which suggests that sunlight cuts the risks of developing some
*25:33.000- 25:39.100* :  health conditions such as cancer and that exposure to sunlight measurably reduces blood pressure.
*25:39.780- 25:46.060* :  We know in Britain that on average people's blood pressure is about six millimeters of mercury
*25:46.300- 25:51.420* :  lower in summer than winter. You're 23% more likely to drop dead of a heart attack in winter
*25:51.420- 25:56.600* :  than summer. We need to be thinking about why and previous research that I've done has shown
*25:56.600- 26:02.240* :  that sunlight releases this substance called nitric oxide from your skin where it goes into
*26:02.240- 26:08.000* :  circulation dilates arteries and lowers your blood pressure and high blood pressure is probably
*26:08.000- 26:13.640* :  the leading cause of premature death and disease in the world today because it needs to heart attacks
*26:13.640- 26:18.960* :  and strikes. Now I'm already thinking whether I can persuade my boss as a result of this interview
*26:19.380- 26:23.920* :  that I should in future release while the good weather loss have my desk outside rather than in the
*26:23.920- 26:30.320* :  office but if I do do that and if my boss can be persuaded I will be wearing a hat because I am
*26:30.320- 26:35.160* :  challenged in terms of the amount of hair on the top of my head and I worry a lot actually,
*26:35.160- 26:41.720* :  as I've spent a lot of listeners do, about the risks from sunlight on exposed skin. Can you help us
*26:41.720- 26:46.720* :  to put some of that into context because it's a message we've got loud and clear in recent years.
*26:46.980- 26:53.140* :  Unfortunately dermatologists who've really dominated the debate about sunlight have only considered
*26:53.140- 27:00.180* :  the risks. Sunlight, you know excess UV is a risk for skin cancer but it turns out that thinking
*27:00.180- 27:06.980* :  beyond the skin sunlight has health benefits on other systems like the cardiovascular system
*27:07.360- 27:12.040* :  like preventing cancer and the problem is we've really viewed sunlight in this rather
*27:12.260- 27:16.940* :  one-eyed way. Gosh, what are the risks? What are the risks? How big are the risks? Rather than
*27:17.200- 27:23.400* :  putting it into context and thinking what is the overall risk benefit ratio of sunlight?
*27:24.140- 27:28.780* :  And certainly our research and also I might say research from colleagues in Sweden
*27:28.780- 27:35.280* :  a very similar high latitude North European country has confirmed that there also more sunlight
*27:35.280- 27:42.100* :  exposure correlates with reduced overall deaths. So I would say don't get burnt because burning
*27:42.100- 27:48.000* :  is the big risk factor for melanoma but also think about your overall health and I think for that
*27:48.000- 27:53.320* :  I think we've got the message wrong so far. Is it partly because we've been influenced by parts of
*27:53.320- 27:59.280* :  the world where the risk is greater? Yes, our message on sunlight exposure is copied from that
*27:59.280- 28:05.240* :  public health advice from Australia. I worked as a junior doctor in Queensland, the UV index that
*28:05.240- 28:11.280* :  the burning ability of the sun. In mid-winter was about seven at midday and it rose to about
*28:11.280- 28:19.400* :  14 in mid-summer. Well last year in Glasgow the UV index hit seven for about 10 minutes in the
*28:19.400- 28:25.960* :  whole year and yet we are basing our advice on the advice for white Australians. It's ridiculous.
*28:26.440- 28:31.260* :  Are the Australians really thinking? They are very interestingly about two months ago
*28:31.260- 28:36.700* :  the cancer council, you know combination of all their expert bodies got together and looked again
*28:36.700- 28:42.620* :  at their sunlight advice and there were two big things they said. The first thing was skin color.
*28:42.760- 28:48.420* :  Our advice has been based on what happens to white North Europeans in a really sunny climate.
*28:48.420- 28:54.840* :  That is not correct if you've got darker skin colors and the second thing they talked about was
*28:54.840- 29:00.040* :  the fact that sunlight has health benefits as well and if the Australians can do that
*29:00.040- 29:06.160* :  we absolutely should hear in Britain. Professor Richard Weller talking to Sean Lay.
*29:07.320- 29:14.260* :  Let's finish with a report about a hat, a very expensive hat. It was worn by the American actor
*29:14.260- 29:20.380* :  Harrison Ford in the second installment of the Indiana Jones film franchise and its sold
*29:20.380- 29:28.080* :  at auction in Los Angeles for more than $600,000. It was made specially for the film Indiana Jones
*29:28.080- 29:34.460* :  and the Temple of Doom which was released in 1984. It had belonged to the stars stunt double
*29:34.460- 29:40.840* :  Dean Farrandini who died last year. Tyler Dunn reports. It's arguably one of the most famous
*29:40.840- 29:46.800* :  pieces of headgear in Hollywood history. The dark brown fedora worn by the adventurer and archaeologist
*29:46.800- 29:53.060* :  Indiana Jones. Along with his bullwhip it forms part of the instantly recognisable costume worn by
*29:53.060- 29:58.480* :  the star of the franchise Harrison Ford. This version was made by a hat maker in London and
*29:58.480- 30:03.040* :  is visible early on in the Temple of Doom when Dr Jones and his companions jump from a crashing
*30:03.040- 30:12.820* :  plane in an inflatable raft. It wasn't the only prop to go under the hammer at the auction.
*30:12.820- 30:18.620* :  A helmet worn by an imperial biker scout in the Star Wars movie Return of the Jedi sold for
*30:18.620- 30:25.760* :  just over $300,000 and a suit worn by Daniel Craig in the James Bond film Skyfall went for more
*30:25.760- 30:34.880* :  than $30,000. Tyler Dunn. And that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the
