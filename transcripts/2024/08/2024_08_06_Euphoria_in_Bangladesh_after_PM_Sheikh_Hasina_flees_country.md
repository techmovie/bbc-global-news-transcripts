*02:13.740- 02:19.380* :  Doctors say more than 50 people were killed on Monday alone and many had bullet wounds. More
*02:19.380- 02:24.760* :  than 300 may have died since the unrest began. The country's president has ordered the release of
*02:24.760- 02:29.880* :  the jailed former Prime Minister and the opposition leader Khaled Azir. The Bangladeshi army chief
*02:29.880- 02:34.560* :  general Waka Ouzaman has said he's forming an interim government and he's talking to political
*02:34.560- 02:40.020* :  leaders. Regarding Shay Casina's departure, these people in Dhaka described it as a moment of
*02:40.020- 02:46.460* :  celebration. This is not just the end of the tyrant Shay Casina. With this we put an end to the
*02:46.460- 02:51.400* :  mafia state that she has created. We put an end to the corporate cleft across it that she has
*02:51.400- 02:57.580* :  concerted. We don't want a military government. What we need is a civilian starter. We need a
*02:57.580- 03:03.060* :  civilist government and we're going to ensure it. We are getting what we deserve. What 16th floor,
*03:03.060- 03:08.420* :  our 18th floor people of this country deserves. Everyone is happy. Everyone is cheerful.
*03:08.980- 03:12.100* :  Everyone is celebrating. This has to be a historical day.
*03:12.640- 03:18.380* :  Reports say looting and vandalism continues across the country with the Bangabandu Memorial Museum
*03:18.380- 03:24.580* :  in Dhaka set ablaze. The unrest began a month ago in response to a quota system for civil service
*03:24.580- 03:30.180* :  jobs. That snowboard into an anti-government movement clashing with the police. It has been at the
*03:30.180- 03:36.480* :  most violent period in Bangladesh since its fight for independence in 1971. But what will happen next?
*03:36.960- 03:40.800* :  I've been talking to our South Asia regional editor and barrison etharajan.
*03:41.280- 03:47.140* :  First of all let's describe how historic and dramatic it has been 24 hours ago when we spoke
*03:47.140- 03:54.180* :  about the situation. I did say that when people forget the fear of bullets then it doesn't
*03:54.180- 04:00.120* :  auger well for the government and now you've seen how people's power has really won. Now what's
*04:00.120- 04:05.660* :  happening now at the moment is people are still celebrating in some parts of Dhaka. At the same
*04:05.660- 04:13.880* :  time a bit of lawlessness looting is happening. People are also attacking police stations. Police
*04:13.880- 04:19.960* :  headquarters was attacked. Even today more than 50 people were killed in various violent incidents.
*04:19.960- 04:25.460* :  Many of them had bullet wounds so we don't know who shot them. Some of the footage I've seen.
*04:25.460- 04:30.040* :  People are attacking each other. This was all about you know in the last few weeks there were
*04:30.040- 04:35.240* :  also supporters of the Avami League which was the governing party in Bangladesh. They joined with
*04:35.240- 04:41.280* :  the police and attacking protesters. So there is a lot of anger and people now the recrimination has
*04:41.280- 04:47.680* :  started. But it is also percolating down to different cities and towns where the minorities like
*04:47.680- 04:53.340* :  the Hindu minorities being attacked because they were always seen supporting Shekhasina. So they
*04:53.340- 05:00.760* :  were also being targeted. Now the military chief he says that from tomorrow the banks and other
*05:00.760- 05:07.080* :  offices will open so that normalcy will return but the student leaders are insisting that they want
*05:07.080- 05:11.980* :  to see what kind of government is being announced and they want to have a say because they say
*05:12.440- 05:17.800* :  they triggered this revolution what they call and that is why they want to have a say so that
*05:18.100- 05:23.100* :  this kind of what they describe as dictatorship doesn't come back. As you say I don't suppose they
*05:23.100- 05:27.600* :  were protesting for weeks to get a military government. Now they were initially protesting for us
*05:27.600- 05:32.820* :  quotas in civil service job they wanted to abolish the system saying that it was discriminatory
*05:33.400- 05:38.820* :  and because you know they were like when you reach a level where you don't realize what is
*05:38.820- 05:43.300* :  happening on the ground this is exactly what happened to Shekhasina. She lost patch with the reality
*05:43.900- 05:49.720* :  and instead of solving the problem easily by changing the quota system she made some comments which
*05:49.720- 05:56.160* :  angered the students and then she also sent in her youth wing which really attacked and then that
*05:56.160- 06:01.360* :  triggered the whole violence so they have now become a nationwide movement people from various
*06:01.360- 06:07.000* :  walks of life joined and it is also a lesson of course many of them have not learned for many
*06:07.000- 06:12.160* :  people who style of autocratic style that power is not yet handled.
*06:13.040- 06:18.500* :  Ah Sathasia regional editor and barrison etharajan with me. As the news was breaking on Monday
*06:18.500- 06:23.800* :  that Shekhasina had resigned my colleague Rebecca Kesby managed to get through to her son Satji

*06:29.020- 06:34.180* :  technology. He was speaking from Washington DC so what did he know of his mother's situation
*06:34.180- 06:39.860* :  as those developments took place? I spoke with her last night but I've been in touch with my and
*06:40.840- 06:47.680* :  situation is I'm sure you're aware my mother was considering resigning since yesterday and
*06:48.060- 06:54.240* :  today she did so and for her safety we are sure to leave the country because given the history
*06:54.240- 07:03.560* :  of my family of 1975 when my entire family was slaughtered in a coup we really urged her to leave
*07:03.560- 07:10.580* :  she didn't want to but the rest of us family insisted. And when you spoke to her what sort of mood
*07:10.580- 07:16.300* :  did she seem to be in? I mean she was in a fine mood she was very disappointed she has turned
*07:16.300- 07:21.620* :  Bangladesh around in the last 15 years when she took over power it was considered a failing state
*07:21.620- 07:28.880* :  it was a poor country it was considered the most corrupt country in the world until today it was
*07:28.880- 07:36.460* :  considered one of the rising tigers of Asia it's a middle income country and she's very disappointed
*07:36.460- 07:42.360* :  that minority of the people which you know we had elections seven months ago our government we had
*07:42.360- 07:48.140* :  predicted all our polls I run the polling for our country it predicted a landslide which it was
*07:48.920- 07:55.400* :  it was going to be such a landslide that our opposition boycott and then for the up sorry to
*07:55.400- 08:00.080* :  jump in but the opposition said that these were not free and fair elections they said it
*08:00.600- 08:07.080* :  dangerous to speak out criticized the government number of political prisoners in jail and then we
*08:07.080- 08:13.600* :  see how the government has dealt with these protests over the past couple of weeks you know live

*08:36.640- 08:41.500* :  none none none the less than what do you expect the police to do when when mobs are beating
*08:42.140- 08:48.040* :  people to death should the police just let them kill people none none the less though there it has
*08:48.040- 08:53.980* :  been a curfew over the past couple of days across certainly DACA and in spite of that only at night
*08:54.400- 08:58.500* :  tens of thousands came out in spite of that though to join these protests today
*08:59.480- 09:05.200* :  Bangladesh is a country of 180 million people 10,000 people on the streets is not really a
*09:05.200- 09:11.160* :  massive number this was of occult minority and that's fine you see you'll see the result in
*09:11.160- 09:15.660* :  Bangladesh in the next couple of days in the next couple of years all development will cease
*09:15.660- 09:21.540* :  the Islamist militants that we had kept at bay will research Bangladesh will become like another

*18:58.920- 19:05.640* :  of those involved in the process who will feel the full force of the law I heard more from our political
*19:05.640- 19:10.780* :  correspondent Rob Watson as there were concerns of unrest in the city of Plymouth in southern England
*19:11.320- 19:16.660* :  it's a reminder that it's Plymouth Andrew that this is not some localized problem that it's
*19:16.660- 19:22.980* :  all over England so and in northern Ireland as well so I think it's something like 15 cities now
*19:23.300- 19:28.440* :  as you mentioned it it's been attacks on mosques it's been attacks on members of ethnic minority
*19:28.440- 19:35.460* :  it's been attacks on the police has been looting I mean you name it it's violent disorder of the
*19:35.460- 19:41.660* :  most violent kind what has sparked it well it's hard to say really but the trigger appears to have
*19:41.660- 19:48.700* :  been the killing of these three young girls at a dance class last Monday and the misinformation
*19:48.700- 19:55.000* :  the disinformation that the suspect was a muslim was someone who was a failed asylum seeker and had
*19:55.000- 20:00.240* :  been on a terrorism watch list so essentially you've got people on the street saying well we're
*20:00.240- 20:06.400* :  here because the state can't protect white children from non-white attackers and do you think the
*20:06.400- 20:11.680* :  new prime minister who's been in office for one month today he's in control of events here or just
*20:11.680- 20:16.860* :  trying to sound like he's in control of events it's a very good question and I mean I think
*20:17.460- 20:21.720* :  the answer is that any government would struggle with the kind of disorder that we've seen and
*20:21.720- 20:26.520* :  it's worth trying to get this into some perspective and we've seen nothing like this since the
*20:26.520- 20:32.740* :  summer riots of 2011 and I've been reporting on Britain on an offer I don't know four decades
*20:32.740- 20:37.660* :  Andrew and I can't really remember anything on this sort of scale and the government is struggling
*20:37.660- 20:44.100* :  because these riots they're not being organized centrally by a particular party or an individual
*20:44.100- 20:49.880* :  that's coming up organically it's stuff being put out on social media that's getting people to
*20:49.880- 20:54.880* :  come out locally so I guess the government would say look we have a robust police operation they
*20:54.880- 20:59.680* :  talked about a standing army basically that means they've got something like six thousand police
*21:00.240- 21:04.760* :  enforcers across the UK who have this specialist training in public order they're on standby
*21:05.360- 21:10.040* :  the justice system is on standby because essentially the government is treating this not as a
*21:10.040- 21:15.720* :  political protest but as an issue of criminality that it's a minority that it's violent
*21:15.820- 21:21.800* :  and that it will be cracked down on. Oh political correspondent Rob Watson, events have taken place
*21:21.800- 21:27.280* :  in Australia to mark the 80th anniversary of a mass escape by Japanese prisoners of war from
*21:27.280- 21:32.460* :  their internment camp in the remote town of Kaura in New South Wales hundreds of them died
*21:32.900- 21:37.820* :  Mickey Bristo has the story. Jap wounded left to die by their comrades are brought in by Australians
*21:37.820- 21:44.060* :  out on patrol. What I'm new to post describe how Japanese soldiers captured in Papua New Guinea
*21:44.060- 21:50.760* :  were sent to internment camps in Australia including Kaura many were ashamed of being taken prisoner
*21:51.320- 21:58.600* :  so they planned a mass escape in the early hours of August the 5th 1944 and with sharpened cutlery
*21:58.600- 22:04.340* :  and other improvised weapons more than a thousand Japanese prisoners took part in the Kaura breakout
*22:05.400- 22:12.360* :  230 of them were gunned down a handful of Australian soldiers also died in what turned out to be
*22:12.360- 22:18.720* :  the only land battle fought in Australia in the second world war despite the odds 300 prisoners
*22:18.720- 22:25.740* :  did manage to scale barbed wire fences and flee but all were soon recaptured some killed themselves
*22:26.740- 22:33.140* :  the Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attended a ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary
*22:33.580- 22:39.800* :  At a time when there is so much turmoil and conflict in the world is important to remember
*22:40.600- 22:47.680* :  that out of those very dark days of World War II has grown a friendship between our two nations
*22:48.520- 22:52.520* :  the Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese ending that report by Mickey Bristol
*22:53.480- 22:58.860* :  the independent US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr has admitted to being behind
*22:58.860- 23:03.220* :  a bizarre prank that baffled New York City residents a decade ago
*23:03.220- 23:09.300* :  in a video on social media Mr. Kennedy claimed he dumped the body of a dead bear in central park
*23:09.840- 23:13.700* :  adding he made it look like the animal had been killed in a bicycle accident
*23:18.300- 23:24.920* :  it was fun for people so everybody thought that's a great idea
*23:24.920- 23:30.000* :  so we wanted that and we thought it would be a music for whoever found it or something
*23:31.240- 23:39.060* :  the next day it was like it was on every television station it was the front page of every paper
*23:39.620- 23:44.980* :  Ryan King from the New York Post told my colleague Sean Lay why Mr. Kennedy had revealed the incident now
*23:44.980- 23:52.200* :  about 10 years ago there was a woman walking her dog in central park and she stumbled upon
*23:52.200- 23:58.160* :  this dead bear it was on top of a bike people in New York kind of start freaking out about it
*23:58.180- 24:03.120* :  and it was a big local controversy investigators showed up they were trying to examine the bike
*24:03.120- 24:08.160* :  trying to see what was happening ultimately the story kind of went away we never really learned to
*24:08.780- 24:14.680* :  did it and then as you say just in the last few days we have this apparent confession
*24:14.680- 24:21.820* :  and not just a confession of any old person but from a Kennedy and the Kennedy who is running for
*24:21.820- 24:27.020* :  president that's right it came out of the blue just in the middle of the day Robert F. Kennedy Jr
*24:27.020- 24:33.660* :  went on social media with this video messing up to this and he basically was trying to preempt
*24:33.660- 24:39.160* :  this story that was going to come out by the New Yorker and that story just had like a little
*24:39.160- 24:44.260* :  bit of an anecdote of this bear situation he was just talking about how you know he has a little
*24:44.260- 24:50.520* :  bit of red neck in him and was kind of joking about it and some of the people in the video including
*24:50.520- 24:55.340* :  actress Roseanne Barr they kind of looked a little bit puzzled like they were a little bit baffled
*24:55.360- 24:59.780* :  by it in the video when he was explaining it but it kind of seemed like he was almost a little
*24:59.780- 25:05.840* :  bit proud of the situation amused by it personally and when the New Yorker published a story they
*25:05.840- 25:11.880* :  had a photo of R.F.K. Jr. posing with the bear and he had his like fingers like in the dead bear's
*25:11.900- 25:17.240* :  mouth it was definitely quite an unexpected development the story seems to involve around him going
*25:17.240- 25:25.420* :  on a game hunting trip in New York State finding the bear fancing some bear meat apparently
*25:25.420- 25:30.540* :  quite legal in New York State but provided you've reported finding the bear in the first place
*25:31.200- 25:36.760* :  and partly contrary he apparently hasn't he never reported it supposedly he said at one point
*25:36.760- 25:43.420* :  that he was initially thinking he would put the bear in his car and then try to get a bear tag
*25:43.420- 25:48.360* :  so like he was saying that he initially intended to go to the authorities and get permission to
*25:48.360- 25:54.640* :  skin the bear and then get meat from the bear and put it in his fridge but then basically he
*25:55.220- 26:01.440* :  got delayed on that falconing trip and then got sidetracked into another dinner afterwards and then
*26:01.440- 26:06.660* :  he had to fly out of New York City so he realized he wasn't going to be able to make it back home
*26:07.120- 26:12.260* :  with the bear and he didn't want to leave it sitting in his car so he just decided to take the bear
*26:12.260- 26:17.920* :  and just dump it in central park does it in any way change people's perceptions of him do you think?
*26:17.920- 26:23.240* :  I don't think it changes people's perceptions too much I mean one of the big things is the
*26:23.240- 26:28.360* :  Kennedy name is a huge name in the United States and we've seen in the polling you know there was
*26:28.360- 26:33.520* :  once a few months ago he was starting to get to like 15 percent almost in the polls but
*26:33.520- 26:39.620* :  we've seen lately his polling numbers have kind of started to tumble a bit and especially with
*26:39.620- 26:43.980* :  President Biden dropping out of the race he's lost about a third of his support in like the
*26:43.980- 26:48.700* :  aggregates so from his point of view there may be an upside if it keeps him in the headlines and keeps
*26:48.700- 26:53.700* :  him in people's minds what did he say to the New Yorker about the photograph?
*26:54.340- 27:00.820* :  He told the New Yorker he's like maybe this is where I got my brainworm from a couple weeks back
*27:00.820- 27:07.340* :  it had been revealed that there had been this dispute he was involved in and he had said in court
*27:07.340- 27:13.940* :  that he was delayed because he had a brainworm that was giving him issues so he was just kind of
*27:13.940- 27:20.200* :  making a joke about that. Ryan King from the New York Post. Now sport on Monday it was day 10 of
*27:20.200- 27:25.440* :  the Olympics in Paris I spoke to our reporter Paul Sarah's who began by summing up events on
*27:25.440- 27:31.380* :  the track and in the field. We've witnessed incredible drama in the athletics. Mondo duplicates
*27:31.380- 27:36.920* :  of course won his second successive men's pole vault Olympic gold medal beating the USA's
*27:36.920- 27:42.200* :  Sam Kendrick's into second place with a new world and Olympic record height of six meters
*27:42.660- 27:48.880* :  and 25 centimeters by the way that's the ninth time that duplicates has broken the world leading
*27:48.880- 27:54.100* :  height elsewhere Kenya's world cross country champion Beatrice Chouette took Olympic gold in the
*27:54.100- 28:00.940* :  5,000 meters in Paris ahead of the great Faith Kippiegon who was later disqualified for a lane
*28:00.940- 28:06.180* :  infringement that boosted Cifan Hassan of the Netherlands up to silver and the bronze went to
*28:06.180- 28:11.820* :  Italy's Nadia Batacletti and great Britain's Keely Hodgkinson took gold in the women's 800 meters
*28:12.240- 28:18.560* :  ahead of Ethiopia's Siga de Guma and Mary Mora of Kenya. It's been an amazing Olympic Games for
*28:18.560- 28:23.700* :  the American gymnast Simone Biles and I don't take anything away from what she's achieved by
*28:23.700- 28:28.180* :  saying that actually today might have been a bit disappointing for her. Well yes that's right
*28:28.180- 28:33.280* :  Biles says she's achieved more than her wildest dreams in Paris that's despite two errors
*28:33.280- 28:38.960* :  earlier on Monday that cost her the opportunity to add to further golds to the three that she won
*28:38.960- 28:43.700* :  earlier in the Games. Biles won silver in the floor final behind the Brazilian Hebekah
*28:43.700- 28:49.420* :  Antraji after twice landing outside the area and she finished fifth in the beam final after falling
*28:49.420- 28:53.840* :  off during her routine. And Paul the great thing about the Olympics is you don't know where to look,
*28:53.860- 28:57.200* :  there's so much action going on at the same time just proud of the rest of today for us.
*28:57.340- 29:01.960* :  Well the track cycling got underway we've already enjoyed the road races on the bicycles but the
*29:01.960- 29:07.320* :  British team of Emma Fannouken, Sophie Capewell and Katie Martin took the very first gold in the
*29:07.320- 29:11.520* :  velodrome in the women's team pursuit ahead of New Zealand. They broke the world record there
*29:11.860- 29:15.180* :  and it's the first time that Great Britain have ever won a medal in that event.
*29:15.180- 29:20.320* :  Germany won the gold in the women's three X-3 basket ball beating Spain in the gold medal match
*29:20.740- 29:26.380* :  and the hosts France will face Spain in the men's football final on Friday. France came from behind
*29:26.380- 29:31.220* :  to beat Egypt three one after extra time and Spain needed extra time too. They came from a
*29:31.220- 29:36.440* :  gold down to beat Morocco two one. Paul Sarah's. The sport of chess may not feature in the
*29:36.440- 29:42.120* :  Paris Olympics, it does have its own Olympiad though and a new star. He's the 15-year-old
*29:42.120- 29:46.460* :  Shreya's Royal from London who's become Britain's youngest ever chess grandmaster.
*29:47.080- 29:51.840* :  On Sunday he achieved the third high level performance needed to reach that benchmark at the British
*29:51.840- 29:57.260* :  chess championships in Hull in Northern England. Last year he was invited to Downing Street to take
*29:57.260- 30:02.220* :  on the then prime minister Richie Sunak when the previous government invested about $1.2 million
*30:02.220- 30:08.440* :  into chess. James Kumer Asari spoke to Shreya's and his father Jitendra and first asked the 15-year-old
*30:08.580- 30:13.460* :  how it felt to become Britain's youngest chess grandmaster. It means a lot to me. I felt a lot of
*30:13.460- 30:18.260* :  records in the past but I feel like this is probably my biggest one so far. To be the youngest
*30:18.260- 30:24.780* :  with a grandmaster this record has been broken for about 17 years and I think it's even more fitting
*30:25.860- 30:29.860* :  that actually I played the record holder in this tournament. I actually managed to beat him
*30:30.760- 30:35.580* :  and yeah I was also fortunate enough that he was present when my final round game had finished.
*30:35.700- 30:41.480* :  He came up to me very quickly, congratulated me. Of course achieving such records are huge but
*30:41.480- 30:46.460* :  I think it's also like a good sign for the future. He was like I'm right on the right trajectory
*30:46.780- 30:50.980* :  for promising a future in chess, you know maybe I'll be one of the best chess players in the world.
*30:51.300- 30:56.920* :  Well you've already made this amazing stage in your career and there is an irony of course
*30:56.920- 31:02.360* :  is that you possibly weren't going to be able to be the first British, the youngest British grandmaster
*31:02.360- 31:05.400* :  because there was a chance a few years ago you wouldn't be able to stay in the country perhaps
*31:05.580- 31:11.980* :  Jitendra you can explain what happened. Yeah I think in 2018 my visa was about to expire and
*31:11.980- 31:17.820* :  then after that I have to leave this country. So thank God to English Jesper Dresson. They fought for
*31:17.820- 31:23.860* :  our visa. During that time it was covered by Radio 4 only that was listened by former Home
*31:23.860- 31:30.340* :  Secretary Sajid Javid and also a lot of MPs supported us like Rachel Reeves with the current
*31:30.340- 31:37.700* :  Chancellor. I don't have a big chest. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and based on exceptional talent Sajid
*31:37.700- 31:42.960* :  finally given to stay in this country so I'm thankful to the government as well and whole of
*31:42.960- 31:48.360* :  the media. So exceptional talent. Your dad talked about some of the politicians who helped
*31:48.980- 31:53.000* :  you both stay in the country including as you mentioned the current Chancellor but the previous
*31:53.000- 31:57.300* :  prime minister is someone you played against. You actually went to Downing Street didn't you?
*31:57.480- 32:03.720* :  Yes last year I was invited along with one of the junior to 10 Downing Street. This was because
*32:03.720- 32:08.780* :  the government had decided to give us a very generous grant to help fund some chess in the country
*32:09.100- 32:14.340* :  and I met the prime minister there with Shisunak. I was lovely to chat to him. I of course played
*32:14.340- 32:20.240* :  some chess with him. Of course he's not very good but it did seem like he had a long did the
*32:20.240- 32:25.340* :  match last. Probably very soon. I don't think he knew too much about chess but he clearly displayed
*32:25.340- 32:31.000* :  an interest in it and I could really tell he was interested about the sport. Yeah he was asking
*32:31.000- 32:34.960* :  you a lot of questions. What about the Olympics? Do you think chess should be part of it?
*32:35.080- 32:40.120* :  Yes I believe any traction the chess is getting is certainly very positive and certainly on
*32:40.300- 32:45.400* :  such a big stage like the Olympics. I feel like chess does have a lot of the qualities to be classified
*32:45.400- 32:50.600* :  as a sport so yeah to see it to the Olympics would be really good. The 15-year-old Shreya's Royal

*33:29.980- 33:36.360* :  This is the story of a man who killed so many people he lost count but despite his shocking death
*33:36.360- 33:44.320* :  toll he only served 12 years in jail. It's a standing that anybody could get away with it
*33:44.600- 33:51.780* :  and the families of his victims want justice. That justice system ultimately ignored all of those
*33:51.780- 33:58.440* :  bodies and all of the families. From the bbc world service world of secrets season three
