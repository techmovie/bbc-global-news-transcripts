*01:29.080- 01:30.720* :  and in the early hours of Saturday,
*01:30.720- 01:32.020* :  the 17th of August,
*01:32.020- 01:33.760* :  these are our main stories.
*01:34.380- 01:36.700* :  Palestinian health officials say they've confirmed
*01:36.700- 01:38.840* :  the first case of polioing Gaza
*01:38.840- 01:40.340* :  for a quarter of a century
*01:40.760- 01:42.820* :  after the UN called for ceasefires
*01:42.820- 01:44.880* :  to allow children to be vaccinated.
*01:45.700- 01:48.060* :  Ukraine has destroyed a strategic bridge
*01:48.060- 01:50.440* :  over a river in Russia's curse region

*01:56.980- 01:58.520* :  of treatments and vaccines

*02:00.920- 02:04.100* :  and are urging wealthy countries with supplies to share them.
*02:06.400- 02:07.660* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:07.700- 02:09.580* :  I will be laser-focused
*02:09.580- 02:11.380* :  on creating opportunities
*02:12.020- 02:13.080* :  for the middle class
*02:13.600- 02:15.760* :  that advance their economic security,
*02:16.600- 02:18.240* :  stability, and dignity.
*02:19.080- 02:21.640* :  Kamala Harris unveils her economic plan
*02:21.640- 02:24.220* :  ahead of the US presidential election.
*02:29.140- 02:30.540* :  As we record this podcast,
*02:30.540- 02:32.180* :  there's a flicker of hope
*02:32.180- 02:33.740* :  amid the ruins of Gaza,
*02:34.200- 02:36.640* :  with confirmation that the US Secretary of State
*02:36.640- 02:39.180* :  Anthony Blinken is heading back to Israel
*02:39.620- 02:42.260* :  to ramp up the pressure for a ceasefire deal,
*02:42.740- 02:44.000* :  and President Biden saying
*02:44.000- 02:45.840* :  that an accord tied to the release
*02:45.840- 02:48.480* :  of Israeli hostages has never been closer.
*02:49.160- 02:51.580* :  This was Mr. Biden speaking at the White House
*02:51.920- 02:53.840* :  after two days of talks in Doha
*02:54.080- 02:55.620* :  between mediators from Qatar,
*02:56.080- 02:57.900* :  Egypt, and the United States.
*02:58.400- 03:00.700* :  We are closer than we have ever been.
*03:00.860- 03:02.720* :  I don't want to jinx anything,
*03:03.560- 03:05.920* :  but as my grandfather say,
*03:05.920- 03:06.700* :  the greatest of guys,
*03:06.700- 03:08.100* :  good little names, a lot of luck.
*03:08.400- 03:09.420* :  We may have something,
*03:09.920- 03:11.020* :  but we're not there yet.
*03:11.200- 03:12.840* :  There's much much closer than it was
*03:12.900- 03:13.580* :  three days ago.
*03:13.700- 03:15.120* :  So keep your fingers crossed.
*03:15.740- 03:18.240* :  But if the Americans are making positive noises
*03:18.240- 03:20.040* :  about a possible ceasefire,
*03:20.500- 03:22.780* :  Friday saw confirmation of a new threat
*03:22.780- 03:24.060* :  to the people of Gaza.
*03:24.360- 03:26.000* :  As health officials there said,
*03:26.000- 03:27.380* :  they'd found the first case
*03:27.760- 03:29.940* :  of the life-threatening disease polio
*03:29.940- 03:31.600* :  in a 10-month-old baby,
*03:32.140- 03:34.060* :  and the UN appealed for the fighting to stop
*03:34.060- 03:36.080* :  for long enough to allow the vaccination
*03:36.080- 03:38.760* :  of more than 600,000 children.
*03:39.480- 03:42.100* :  The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres
*03:42.100- 03:44.460* :  said preventing and containing the spread
*03:44.460- 03:46.540* :  of the disease would take a massive
*03:47.500- 03:48.940* :  coordinated and urgent effort.
*03:49.520- 03:52.900* :  It is impossible to conduct a polio vaccination campaign
*03:53.700- 03:55.220* :  with war raging all over.
*03:56.060- 03:57.760* :  Polio goes beyond politics.
*03:58.820- 04:01.580* :  And so it is our shared obligation to come together,
*04:02.480- 04:04.760* :  to mobilize, not to fight people,
*04:04.860- 04:06.020* :  but to fight polio,
*04:06.860- 04:10.320* :  and to defeat vicious virus that left and checked,
*04:11.120- 04:12.680* :  would have a disastrous effect,
*04:13.420- 04:15.540* :  not only for Palestinian children in Gaza,
*04:16.100- 04:18.620* :  but also in neighboring countries and the region.
*04:19.220- 04:21.820* :  Our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman
*04:21.840- 04:24.000* :  has been monitoring the progress of the talks
*04:24.000- 04:25.480* :  to broker a ceasefire.
*04:25.960- 04:29.940* :  Anthony Blinken will now travel to the region arriving in Israel.
*04:29.940- 04:31.920* :  That will be at the moment the first
*04:32.180- 04:34.280* :  and only announced stop on this trip,
*04:34.280- 04:36.460* :  but I expect it will probably head off
*04:36.460- 04:40.040* :  to some Arab capitals after that as well.
*04:40.420- 04:41.620* :  I think that shows two things.
*04:41.620- 04:44.720* :  One is that the very fact this trip is back on,
*04:44.960- 04:46.580* :  and it's hung in the Balanced all week,
*04:47.260- 04:48.620* :  because Washington has been watching
*04:48.620- 04:51.340* :  to see whether or not Iran would retaliate
*04:51.800- 04:54.060* :  for the assassination, believed to have been carried out
*04:54.060- 04:55.640* :  by Israel of Ismail Haneer,
*04:55.640- 04:58.840* :  the political leader of Hamas in Tehran.
*04:59.240- 05:01.660* :  That has been hanging over this the whole time,
*05:01.760- 05:04.540* :  and has been why there's been really sort of drip feed
*05:04.540- 05:07.780* :  of leaks about whether or not Mr Blinken will be traveling
*05:07.780- 05:08.560* :  to the region.
*05:08.980- 05:11.100* :  There was he didn't want to go if they believe
*05:11.100- 05:13.940* :  that such an attack was more likely than not,
*05:14.600- 05:17.520* :  because of course it would also have derailed the ceasefire talks.
*05:18.000- 05:20.000* :  And that's the second point that these two issues
*05:20.000- 05:22.500* :  have become entirely intertwined now
*05:22.980- 05:25.520* :  about a potential breakthrough in the ceasefire talks,
*05:26.120- 05:28.760* :  and Iran's threatened retaliation to Israel,
*05:29.360- 05:31.560* :  because I think the American feeling is very much that,
*05:31.880- 05:33.720* :  you know, it heightens the possibility
*05:33.720- 05:35.300* :  of an Iranian strike significantly
*05:35.760- 05:38.820* :  if it looks as though the ceasefire talks are falling apart.
*05:39.380- 05:42.080* :  So what we have now is after 48 hours of talks
*05:42.080- 05:43.520* :  in Doha as you've been hearing,
*05:43.520- 05:46.620* :  a lot of very positive messaging from the Americans.
*05:46.620- 05:48.420* :  You heard what Joe Biden said there.
*05:48.900- 05:50.000* :  So they think there's momentum.
*05:50.000- 05:52.400* :  But on the other hand, the Palestinian version
*05:52.880- 05:54.460* :  not so positive at all.
*05:54.520- 05:58.160* :  I think Mr Blinken's trip is really about piling public pressure
*05:58.400- 06:01.280* :  on all the sides to keep the engagement going
*06:01.280- 06:02.440* :  and to try and take a deal.
*06:02.940- 06:05.940* :  Tom Bateman, as we heard in our earlier podcast,
*06:05.940- 06:09.660* :  Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are reeling
*06:09.660- 06:13.180* :  after Israeli settlers ravaged a village on Thursday night,
*06:13.600- 06:16.060* :  killing one young man and injuring others.
*06:16.700- 06:19.180* :  There's been widespread condemnation of the attack
*06:19.180- 06:20.760* :  with the Palestinian Authority
*06:21.420- 06:23.820* :  describing it as organized state terrorism.
*06:23.940- 06:27.820* :  The UN says nearly 600 Palestinians have been killed
*06:27.820- 06:30.640* :  in the West Bank by Israeli settlers and troops,
*06:31.140- 06:34.580* :  since Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on October 7th
*06:34.840- 06:36.760* :  and the ensuing war in Gaza.
*06:37.420- 06:39.540* :  Lucy Williamson reports from the scene
*06:39.540- 06:41.320* :  of the violence in the West Bank.
*06:46.560- 06:49.140* :  The crowd of men moving through the narrow,
*06:49.140- 06:51.620* :  steep streets of Jeep village,
*06:52.380- 06:55.980* :  chanting as they carry the body of Rashida Sidi overhead,
*06:56.660- 06:58.780* :  bringing it to his mother's house, the burial.
*07:00.960- 07:01.840* :  My son is gone.
*07:01.840- 07:05.080* :  Imanna Siddi told me, and the settlers aligned to us.
*07:05.380- 07:06.320* :  They won't do anything.
*07:06.320- 07:07.840* :  They helped the shooter escape.
*07:08.840- 07:12.080* :  As she wept over the body, the crowd packed around the entrance
*07:12.080- 07:15.380* :  to the house, chanted slogans honoring Rashid,
*07:15.680- 07:17.560* :  as a hero who protected his village.
*07:18.540- 07:21.680* :  His aunt, Ammourad, said the ambulance that came for him
*07:21.980- 07:23.140* :  was blocked by the army.
*07:25.620- 07:28.260* :  Even the ambulance was blocked by the army.
*07:28.740- 07:30.160* :  They waited until he died,
*07:30.540- 07:32.540* :  until the houses were completely burned
*07:32.540- 07:35.320* :  to let the ambulance and the fire brigade in.
*07:35.980- 07:37.700* :  The blame is more on the army
*07:38.000- 07:40.060* :  because they are not controlling the settlers.
*07:40.520- 07:43.220* :  The settlers come under the protection of the army.
*07:45.800- 07:47.660* :  Rashid's younger brother, Mahdi,
*07:47.960- 07:50.360* :  his 14-year-old face swamped by a cave
*07:50.360- 07:52.480* :  shows us where Rashid was shot,
*07:53.080- 07:55.440* :  a dirt road in front of a chain-link fence
*07:55.960- 07:56.760* :  broken in places.
*07:57.260- 07:59.840* :  Beyond it is an Israeli security watch tower
*07:59.840- 08:02.720* :  with what appears to be line of sight to the area.
*08:03.200- 08:05.180* :  We heard that there were settlers here.
*08:05.500- 08:08.000* :  When we went to see, they were already burning houses
*08:08.480- 08:09.820* :  and then the clashes started.
*08:10.040- 08:12.480* :  Rashid threw a stone and then he was shot.
*08:12.960- 08:14.600* :  The bullet entered from one side
*08:14.820- 08:15.980* :  and exited from the other.
*08:16.300- 08:17.380* :  And he was shot from the other side.
*08:18.740- 08:21.540* :  A neighbor, Safyan, told me there were
*08:21.540- 08:24.660* :  dozens of gunshots from the settlers gathered at the fence.
*08:25.340- 08:26.520* :  Some were dressed all in white.
*08:27.100- 08:28.540* :  Some all in black, he said.
*08:28.700- 08:31.200* :  He called the Israeli army, he said,
*08:31.740- 08:34.700* :  who arrived two hours later and took the settlers away.
*08:36.560- 08:40.060* :  Israel's army says it has launched a thorough investigation.
*08:40.820- 08:42.880* :  The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
*08:42.880- 08:44.920* :  those responsible would be prosecuted.
*08:45.680- 08:47.980* :  Israel is under fierce international scrutiny
*08:47.980- 08:49.960* :  over settler violence in the West Bank.
*08:50.500- 08:54.140* :  Both the US and the UK have imposed sanctions on settlers.
*08:54.520- 08:57.680* :  For acts of violence, they say Israel is not policing
*08:57.720- 08:59.240* :  or prosecuting itself.
*09:03.480- 09:06.300* :  Rashid Sidi's body was carried from the mosque
*09:06.360- 09:07.820* :  towards the village cemetery,
*09:08.460- 09:11.200* :  leading a procession of bitterness and anger.
*09:12.020- 09:15.060* :  A symbol of the violence that many here trace back
*09:15.060- 09:17.680* :  to the behavior of Israeli security forces
*09:18.360- 09:20.380* :  and the policies of Israeli politicians.
*09:22.620- 09:24.120* :  Lucy Williamson reporting.
*09:25.160- 09:28.800* :  Ukraine's troops have destroyed a strategically important bridge
*09:28.800- 09:30.800* :  in the Russian region of Kursk.
*09:31.140- 09:33.080* :  The move will make it harder for Moscow
*09:33.080- 09:35.740* :  to supply its forces and evacuate civilians.
*09:36.380- 09:39.300* :  President Zelensky has described the captured territory
*09:39.300- 09:40.880* :  as an exchange fund,
*09:41.320- 09:44.060* :  implying it could be swapped for Ukrainian regions
*09:44.100- 09:45.600* :  occupied by Moscow.
*09:46.240- 09:47.780* :  Our correspondent, James Waterhouse,
*09:47.780- 09:50.140* :  reports from Ukraine's region of Sumi,
*09:50.140- 09:51.560* :  which borders Kursk.
*09:52.040- 09:54.480* :  Ukraine's blistering land grab might be slowing,
*09:54.500- 09:55.820* :  but it's still going.
*09:56.080- 09:58.380* :  Its forces have crossed into two Russian regions
*09:58.420- 10:01.060* :  and a major bridge to the north has been destroyed.
*10:01.520- 10:03.400* :  Russian resistance is materializing
*10:03.400- 10:05.060* :  in the form of familiar tactics.
*10:05.660- 10:07.680* :  Artillery and drone units are being deployed.
*10:07.680- 10:09.440* :  Allied bombs are falling from the sky
*10:09.820- 10:12.200* :  and thousands of troops have been sent in from elsewhere.
*10:15.440- 10:16.500* :  On the other side of the border
*10:16.500- 10:18.380* :  in the Ukrainian region of Sumi,
*10:18.820- 10:20.180* :  military supplies and personnel
*10:20.180- 10:22.740* :  still speed back and forth along the main route.
*10:23.160- 10:25.300* :  Anatoly is just returned from Russian soil
*10:25.300- 10:28.060* :  and tells us he's noticed the difference in progress.
*10:32.140- 10:33.140* :  We are still advancing.
*10:33.680- 10:36.020* :  It slowed down a bit, but we're moving forward.
*10:36.400- 10:38.260* :  As long as we have orders and instructions,
*10:38.740- 10:39.580* :  we'll keep on moving.
*10:39.740- 10:41.240* :  Despite Russia being forced to react,
*10:41.780- 10:44.020* :  invading troops are now within almost 10 kilometers
*10:44.020- 10:46.640* :  of Prokropsk and Eastern Ukrainian town.
*10:47.000- 10:48.400* :  I've gradually watched be destroyed
*10:48.400- 10:50.440* :  by airstrikes over the past year.
*10:54.300- 10:56.960* :  The mayor there is urging people to evacuate.
*10:57.520- 10:58.860* :  From speaking to soldiers and listening
*10:58.860- 11:00.700* :  to the comments of Mikhail Podoliak,
*11:00.860- 11:02.720* :  President Zelensky's senior advisor
*11:03.040- 11:04.640* :  on wanting to force Russia to negotiate,
*11:04.700- 11:07.420* :  it feels like Ukraine's objectives are shifting.
*11:07.880- 11:08.940* :  With its goal of liberation,
*11:09.020- 11:10.100* :  seeming ever distant,
*11:10.100- 11:13.400* :  Kiev is focusing on producing its own bargaining chips
*11:13.400- 11:14.760* :  for a future peace deal,
*11:15.120- 11:17.000* :  regardless of when that might be.
*11:17.660- 11:18.600* :  James Waterhouse.
*11:19.580- 11:21.460* :  In the weeks since Kamala Harris
*11:21.460- 11:24.020* :  became the de facto democratic nominee
*11:24.020- 11:25.480* :  for the US presidency,
*11:26.080- 11:28.500* :  she's ridden high on a wave of enthusiasm
*11:28.520- 11:30.380* :  and goodwill from her supporters.
*11:31.060- 11:34.140* :  Until now, she's spoken a lot about what she claims
*11:34.140- 11:36.800* :  with the dangers of another Trump presidency,
*11:37.340- 11:39.360* :  but little about her own policies.
*11:40.060- 11:42.300* :  Well, on Friday in Raleigh, North Carolina,
*11:42.320- 11:43.620* :  she changed all that
*11:43.620- 11:46.520* :  and gave some details of her economic plans.
*11:46.960- 11:48.800* :  Our country has come a long way
*11:49.400- 11:51.180* :  since President Biden and I took office.
*11:51.980- 11:56.020* :  And today, by virtually every measure,
*11:56.840- 11:59.980* :  our economy is the strongest in the world.
*12:03.480- 12:05.220* :  And as President of the United States,
*12:05.260- 12:07.320* :  it will be my intention to build
*12:07.320- 12:09.480* :  on the foundation of this progress.
*12:10.500- 12:13.540* :  Still, we know that many Americans
*12:14.220- 12:17.740* :  don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives.
*12:18.740- 12:21.340* :  As President, I will be laser-focused
*12:21.420- 12:24.780* :  on creating opportunities for the middle class
*12:24.860- 12:27.560* :  that advance their economic security,
*12:28.380- 12:30.020* :  stability and dignity.
*12:31.080- 12:34.760* :  In her speech, she promised a ban on price hikes on groceries,
*12:35.420- 12:37.720* :  a plan to build three million new homes,
*12:37.720- 12:39.080* :  help for home buyers,
*12:39.560- 12:42.000* :  the slashing of prescription drug costs,
*12:42.440- 12:45.560* :  and an effective tax cart for 100 million Americans.
*12:46.260- 12:47.500* :  She said she wanted to create
*12:47.500- 12:49.960* :  what she called an opportunity economy.
*12:50.500- 12:52.340* :  So what did our North America correspondent,
*12:52.340- 12:55.580* :  Nomiya Igbal, make of Kamala Harris' speech?
*12:56.040- 12:57.380* :  It's a major moment for her
*12:57.600- 12:59.200* :  because she has been accused by critics
*12:59.200- 13:00.860* :  of being all-starling no substance.
*13:00.940- 13:03.500* :  They wanted to know, how do you plan to govern?
*13:03.500- 13:06.580* :  What does a President Harris look like in the first 100 days?
*13:07.180- 13:09.060* :  And the economy is the number one issue
*13:09.560- 13:11.480* :  that voters care about, rising inflation,
*13:11.480- 13:14.460* :  the cost of living, and she addressed all of that
*13:14.460- 13:15.520* :  what her vision was.
*13:15.840- 13:17.900* :  Her speech was 30 minutes long, I think,
*13:17.980- 13:19.520* :  which was pretty short concise,
*13:19.520- 13:21.360* :  if you certainly compare it to Donald Trump,
*13:21.360- 13:25.280* :  who gave a speech in North Carolina also yesterday.
*13:26.280- 13:27.880* :  And she laid out what her vision was.
*13:27.940- 13:30.000* :  It wasn't anything radical from what we've seen
*13:30.520- 13:31.360* :  regarding President Biden.
*13:31.360- 13:33.880* :  I don't think we expected it to be, of course, Biden
*13:34.520- 13:36.440* :  and Harris together have developed
*13:36.440- 13:38.420* :  their economy plan over the last few years.
*13:38.740- 13:42.520* :  But I think what stood out was the way she kind of presented it.
*13:42.920- 13:46.540* :  She can talk about the economy and people's fears
*13:46.540- 13:48.640* :  with more ease than President Biden could.
*13:48.640- 13:52.020* :  He was criticized for not showing enough empathy.
*13:52.020- 13:55.300* :  He would often talk about how the economy's growing fast
*13:55.300- 13:57.480* :  unemployment is low, things are getting better,
*13:57.480- 13:59.040* :  and all of that is factually true.
*13:59.480- 14:00.560* :  As you heard in the clip there,
*14:00.940- 14:03.180* :  Ms. Harris did make the point of showing empathy,
*14:03.180- 14:06.100* :  saying, well, actually, you can say all these things
*14:06.100- 14:08.300* :  are going on, but if people don't feel that way,
*14:08.680- 14:11.940* :  if you don't go where they are, then they don't believe you.
*14:12.260- 14:14.720* :  And it's something that's an important issue, as I say,
*14:14.720- 14:16.300* :  because voters care about it,
*14:16.460- 14:20.260* :  but the polls also suggest that they believe
*14:20.260- 14:22.080* :  in Donald Trump's vision more,
*14:22.080- 14:25.560* :  that they think he is stronger on the economy
*14:25.560- 14:27.160* :  with his vision than she is.
*14:27.700- 14:30.180* :  So it is a crucial issue for her to tackle,
*14:30.180- 14:31.200* :  and she did that today.
*14:31.960- 14:32.720* :  Nomiya Igpal.
*14:36.120- 14:36.780* :  Still to come.
*14:37.100- 14:38.480* :  Feeling a bit twitchy right now?
*14:38.780- 14:40.340* :  Are you happy with the team you've got?
*14:40.600- 14:42.260* :  Fairly happy, but straight away after this,
*14:42.260- 14:44.500* :  I will be going and fiddling around with my team
*14:44.500- 14:47.240* :  to see if there's any changes I can make.
*14:47.520- 14:49.880* :  A new study finds that fantasy football
*14:50.040- 14:51.660* :  can challenge your mental health.
*14:51.700- 14:54.280* :  It took a lifetime to find the person you want to marry.
*15:02.820- 15:06.080* :  Finding the perfect engagement ring is a lot easier.
*15:06.580- 15:09.760* :  At BlueNile.com, you can find or design the ring

*16:08.540- 16:10.940* :  The world is in danger of repeating mistakes
*16:10.940- 16:13.660* :  made during the COVID-19 pandemic.
*16:13.660- 16:16.000* :  The warning from the World Health Organization
*16:16.000- 16:19.260* :  after declaring MPOX a global health emergency.
*16:19.900- 16:21.380* :  The highly contagious disease,
*16:21.380- 16:23.020* :  formerly known as monkeypox,
*16:23.400- 16:25.620* :  has killed at least 450 people
*16:25.620- 16:27.160* :  during an initial outbreak
*16:27.160- 16:29.300* :  in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
*16:29.900- 16:33.220* :  It's now spread across parts of Central and East Africa.
*16:33.780- 16:37.340* :  Its first case in Europe was recorded in Sweden on Thursday.
*16:37.340- 16:40.620* :  I heard more from our Geneva correspondent, Image and Folks.
*16:41.160- 16:42.760* :  First of all, there are two variants.
*16:42.840- 16:45.860* :  You know, we had an MPOX outbreak a couple of years ago
*16:46.100- 16:48.160* :  and that was what was called clade-2,
*16:48.360- 16:50.880* :  which is a somewhat milder version.
*16:50.880- 16:53.200* :  The one that is circulating now is clade-1,
*16:53.840- 16:55.340* :  which is more serious
*16:55.340- 16:57.420* :  and a variant of it called clade-1-B.
*16:58.040- 17:01.660* :  It starts with aches and pains feeling flu-like,
*17:01.700- 17:07.020* :  but people who have it do develop these lesions blisters almost
*17:07.040- 17:08.980* :  and these, when they burst,
*17:09.220- 17:10.980* :  say, are filled with the virus.
*17:10.980- 17:12.280* :  They're loaded with the virus.
*17:12.280- 17:16.200* :  So it can be transmitted through sexual contact,
*17:17.040- 17:22.020* :  but also through cuddling a child, for example, hugs.
*17:22.740- 17:24.120* :  We heard today from the WHO
*17:24.120- 17:28.200* :  that people who have handled the bedding or clothes of somebody
*17:28.260- 17:32.440* :  who has MPOX have also been infected.
*17:33.000- 17:35.740* :  This new variant is more lethal.
*17:35.740- 17:37.080* :  There are more mortalities
*17:37.220- 17:40.800* :  than the one that was circulating a couple of years ago.
*17:41.460- 17:44.180* :  And what the WHO are saying today is,
*17:44.760- 17:47.960* :  you need to treat it vigorously
*17:47.960- 17:49.800* :  where it is really circulating,
*17:49.800- 17:53.340* :  which remains DRC, and then it won't come to you.
*17:53.740- 17:56.520* :  And the plea is wealthy countries in Europe,
*17:56.520- 17:59.660* :  United States, who have vaccines for MPOX.
*18:00.220- 18:03.960* :  Please, Africa has scarcely any, if any at all,
*18:04.420- 18:08.060* :  donate them now, and we can bring this epidemic under control.
*18:08.700- 18:11.920* :  So there's been a case outside of Africa in Europe.
*18:11.920- 18:16.040* :  How is the WHO responding to the case in Sweden, I believe?
*18:16.600- 18:18.480* :  Well, in twofold, really.
*18:18.860- 18:21.000* :  Obviously, you and I are talking, actually,
*18:21.000- 18:23.900* :  because this case has been discovered in Sweden.
*18:23.900- 18:26.660* :  This is the inequality of health.
*18:26.800- 18:29.700* :  We've had many cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*18:29.700- 18:32.620* :  more than 500 people have died, many of them children.
*18:33.040- 18:34.580* :  We haven't talked about it too much,
*18:34.580- 18:37.500* :  but now that we've got a case in Europe, it's headline news.
*18:38.020- 18:41.560* :  The WHO is concerned that a case has appeared,
*18:42.260- 18:45.720* :  but also described it today as positive,
*18:45.720- 18:48.880* :  how fast the Swedish health authorities
*18:49.620- 18:53.740* :  identified that case and isolated the individual.
*18:54.240- 18:56.840* :  It is not proof that the disease
*18:56.840- 18:58.860* :  is actually circulating in Europe.
*18:59.240- 19:01.880* :  It probably came in with that person.
*19:02.460- 19:05.700* :  The other thing, the WHO, are pleased about,
*19:05.780- 19:07.780* :  though they're not saying this quite so loudly,
*19:07.780- 19:11.880* :  is that the Swedish authorities have gone no further
*19:12.480- 19:16.140* :  to talk about the identity of this person.
*19:16.280- 19:19.920* :  And this leads back to the stigma around this disease
*19:20.920- 19:26.340* :  and the tensions we have in Europe over immigration.
*19:26.540- 19:28.520* :  We don't know who this person is.
*19:28.520- 19:32.040* :  Swedish, somebody from Africa, we don't know.
*19:32.040- 19:34.880* :  It's a person who's being treated, who's being isolated,
*19:35.420- 19:37.480* :  and that is exactly how the WHO
*19:37.520- 19:38.300* :  would like it.
*19:38.300- 19:41.620* :  They don't want to see an excuse to start whipping up
*19:41.620- 19:44.480* :  unfounded fears and prejudices
*19:44.480- 19:46.940* :  over one imported case of a disease.
*19:47.520- 19:50.940* :  Immigen folks, currently there's no cure for impacts,
*19:50.940- 19:54.840* :  but the good news is that we already have a vaccine that works.
*19:55.440- 19:57.800* :  Rebecca Kesby spoke to Paul Chaplin,
*19:57.800- 20:00.120* :  the CEO of Bavarian Nordic,
*20:00.460- 20:04.380* :  which makes one of the two vaccines recommended by the WHO.
*20:04.980- 20:07.640* :  The vaccine that we have, we initially developed
*20:07.640- 20:10.440* :  for a smallpox vaccine together with the US government.
*20:11.220- 20:14.760* :  However, smallpox is closely related to impacts.
*20:15.400- 20:18.300* :  And it's known that if you were protected against
*20:18.300- 20:20.200* :  one of the viruses in that family,
*20:20.200- 20:21.660* :  you protected against all of them.
*20:21.880- 20:25.380* :  Just a caravan, it should be totally effective against
*20:25.720- 20:27.040* :  these variants that we know about.
*20:27.360- 20:27.540* :  Yes.
*20:28.040- 20:32.460* :  So in 22, 23, we distributed more than 15 million doses
*20:32.840- 20:33.480* :  in that outbreak.
*20:34.120- 20:36.480* :  And effectiveness studies were performed
*20:36.480- 20:40.680* :  and it was shown up to be 80% effective or efficacious
*20:41.420- 20:45.200* :  with one vaccination and up to 90% with two vaccinations.
*20:46.160- 20:50.600* :  And where are your current orders coming from?
*20:51.140- 20:54.680* :  Well, currently we've only received one request,
*20:54.680- 20:57.280* :  which was HERA, which is the EU.
*20:57.600- 20:59.720* :  That was the deal that we announced the other day
*20:59.720- 21:03.440* :  where we sold 175,000 doses together
*21:03.460- 21:06.480* :  with HERA, but also the African CDC.
*21:07.240- 21:10.180* :  And we topped that up with another 40,000 doses
*21:10.180- 21:11.020* :  that we donated.
*21:11.700- 21:15.060* :  So that's 215,000 doses, and that is it.
*21:15.720- 21:18.820* :  So there's a lot of discussions ongoing right now
*21:18.820- 21:21.280* :  with WHO, Garvey and different governments.
*21:22.020- 21:24.100* :  But that's the only order that's been placed to date.
*21:24.600- 21:26.500* :  So you mentioned Africa's CDC.
*21:26.500- 21:29.100* :  Is this the African Centers for Disease Control
*21:29.100- 21:29.820* :  and Prevention?
*21:31.080- 21:32.860* :  Because they've actually said that they think
*21:32.860- 21:35.840* :  they're going to need around two million vaccines
*21:35.840- 21:37.360* :  by the end of this year.
*21:37.920- 21:40.240* :  What's it going to take to produce that many?
*21:40.660- 21:42.920* :  Well, we have vaccines on stock right now.
*21:42.920- 21:45.960* :  We have been in routine manufacturing since 22.
*21:46.700- 21:48.720* :  So actual fact, we can actually deliver
*21:49.280- 21:52.300* :  with what we have on stock and with our manufacturing,
*21:52.480- 21:54.260* :  we can actually deliver two million doses
*21:54.260- 21:55.300* :  by the end of this year.
*21:55.480- 21:58.080* :  What would you need and what would you need to know
*21:58.080- 22:00.820* :  before you go into production with that sort of thing?
*22:01.340- 22:04.920* :  To be frank, orders, because that's an awful lot of doses,
*22:04.920- 22:07.240* :  as you mentioned, it would take an awful lot
*22:07.240- 22:09.280* :  of the company's money to produce them.
*22:09.900- 22:11.660* :  So we would need to know there's a customer
*22:12.040- 22:12.960* :  before we can produce.
*22:13.740- 22:16.160* :  We're in discussions with many different organizations.
*22:16.680- 22:20.360* :  We've made it pretty clear that we can supply up to 2 million
*22:20.360- 22:22.180* :  by the end of the year, but decisions
*22:22.180- 22:23.720* :  need to be made very, very soon.
*22:23.800- 22:25.340* :  We're already in mid August.
*22:26.120- 22:29.080* :  So it's not like they can come in a few months' time
*22:29.080- 22:30.900* :  and say, okay, we'll buy those doses.
*22:31.540- 22:34.260* :  We need to know very, very shortly what we need
*22:34.260- 22:37.280* :  to produce this year, because vaccine production takes time.
*22:37.660- 22:40.460* :  And is it the sort of vaccine that you only need to get the once
*22:40.460- 22:43.300* :  or with a booster that you can deal with it in one go
*22:43.300- 22:44.620* :  and it protects you for life?
*22:44.900- 22:47.740* :  It's recommended to have two shots, three to four weeks apart,
*22:47.740- 22:51.220* :  but as I said, the effectiveness data in the 22, 23 outbreak
*22:51.220- 22:54.920* :  was that it was up to 80% effective with one vaccination.
*22:55.820- 22:59.280* :  So you're in a good shape if you risk it one vaccination.
*23:00.040- 23:01.760* :  In terms of how long it lasts,
*23:02.160- 23:05.160* :  you probably need a booster every two to five years.
*23:05.460- 23:07.840* :  There are some challenges though, aren't there?
*23:08.060- 23:12.400* :  In terms of transporting the vaccines and distributing them,
*23:12.480- 23:14.400* :  because I understand it's one of those vaccines
*23:14.400- 23:16.860* :  that's got to be kept at a constant temperature.
*23:17.300- 23:21.700* :  Our vaccine needs to remain frozen at minus 20 degrees Celsius
*23:22.460- 23:25.280* :  and it needs to be thawed shortly before use,
*23:25.460- 23:27.160* :  but can be kept at room temperature
*23:27.220- 23:28.900* :  for only a short period of time.
*23:29.640- 23:32.520* :  So if you're transporting it, it needs to be kept
*23:32.520- 23:35.900* :  in a frozen state until it's finally used
*23:35.900- 23:38.300* :  and in some parts of Africa that is challenging,
*23:39.200- 23:42.200* :  but other vaccines are distributed in the same way today
*23:42.200- 23:43.700* :  in Africa so it can be done.
*23:44.380- 23:46.780* :  Paul Chaplin talking to Rebecca Kesby.
*23:47.720- 23:51.200* :  China's social media is buzzing with posts criticizing
*23:51.200- 23:54.300* :  new proposals to change the country's marriage laws.
*23:54.880- 23:58.080* :  These will make it easier to get married by, for example,
*23:58.080- 24:01.800* :  introducing new rules about where couples are registered to live,
*24:02.280- 24:04.240* :  but more difficult to get a divorce
*24:04.240- 24:06.700* :  with a 30-day cooling off period.
*24:07.200- 24:10.860* :  The authorities hope to stop what it calls impulsive divorces.
*24:11.200- 24:14.180* :  So why is the government proposing these changes?
*24:14.440- 24:17.300* :  Kerry Allen is our China media analyst.
*24:17.720- 24:19.880* :  Only last week there were reports in China
*24:19.880- 24:22.060* :  that the number of weddings recorded
*24:22.060- 24:25.220* :  during the first half of the year are so low
*24:25.380- 24:27.300* :  that China may actually be heading
*24:27.300- 24:30.420* :  to having the lowest number of marriages since 1980.
*24:31.140- 24:33.360* :  So I think the government have very much suddenly thought,
*24:33.600- 24:34.980* :  right, we need to introduce new rules
*24:34.980- 24:37.200* :  to make it much easier for people to get married.
*24:37.700- 24:40.020* :  But why does the government want people to get married?
*24:41.040- 24:44.760* :  Well, because China used to have a one-child policy in place
*24:44.820- 24:48.020* :  and it means that the younger demographic is much, much smaller
*24:48.600- 24:49.620* :  than the older demographic.
*24:49.760- 24:52.500* :  Now, the problem with that is that the older demographic
*24:52.500- 24:56.360* :  are starting to retire and there's nobody to work.
*24:56.360- 24:58.140* :  China wants to maintain the momentum
*24:58.140- 25:01.480* :  of having a huge labor market that it once did.
*25:02.040- 25:03.400* :  And it needs more people to do that.
*25:03.400- 25:06.140* :  So it wants people getting married and having more children.
*25:06.660- 25:07.840* :  In many parts of the world, of course,
*25:07.860- 25:10.780* :  you don't have to be married in order to have children,
*25:10.780- 25:12.360* :  but is that the case in China?
*25:13.000- 25:14.980* :  You don't have to be married, but in China,
*25:14.980- 25:16.980* :  for the family unit is something that's been promoted
*25:16.980- 25:18.580* :  for decades in the country.
*25:19.600- 25:22.360* :  So there's a concept in China of filial piety,
*25:22.360- 25:25.040* :  the idea that you look after your elders
*25:25.040- 25:27.580* :  and generally when they start to retire,
*25:27.580- 25:29.320* :  like all three or four generations
*25:29.420- 25:30.760* :  move into the same household.
*25:30.760- 25:33.460* :  So family is considered very important in China.
*25:33.800- 25:36.720* :  So what's been the reaction to this proposed law
*25:37.160- 25:38.620* :  on social media in China?
*25:38.880- 25:40.740* :  Well, media have tried to present this
*25:40.740- 25:43.680* :  as a way of building a family-friendly society.
*25:43.680- 25:48.300* :  So they're trying to say that this is making it easier for people.
*25:48.300- 25:50.880* :  But even in official media that you'd expect
*25:50.880- 25:53.580* :  to be very praising of these new laws,
*25:53.580- 25:56.820* :  they've said that social media users have actually
*25:57.360- 25:59.880* :  just seen this cynically as a way to try
*25:59.880- 26:02.380* :  and boost the marriage and subsequently birth rate.
*26:02.940- 26:06.160* :  And I've seen for years people on social media platforms
*26:06.160- 26:09.960* :  like Wabo saying that they simply don't want to get married
*26:09.960- 26:11.260* :  now for a number of reasons.
*26:12.160- 26:14.020* :  A major concern is domestic violence
*26:14.020- 26:17.040* :  because China only in very recent years
*26:17.040- 26:18.880* :  introduced domestic violence laws.
*26:18.880- 26:23.400* :  And one of the rules that's in this new revised law
*26:23.940- 26:27.040* :  is that there's a 30-day call-off period for divorce.
*26:27.200- 26:29.540* :  And this is something that's existed for a while in the country,
*26:29.640- 26:31.180* :  but it's been heavily criticised
*26:31.180- 26:33.780* :  and there was the hope that these new laws would remove it.
*26:34.280- 26:37.920* :  And what about the concept of dairies or bride prices?
*26:38.140- 26:40.260* :  That still exists in China, doesn't it?
*26:40.380- 26:41.300* :  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
*26:41.320- 26:45.760* :  It's very much been accepted if a man wants to ask
*26:45.820- 26:47.240* :  for a woman's hand in marriage.
*26:47.600- 26:49.600* :  He needs to own property beforehand.
*26:49.600- 26:52.620* :  And obviously we've gone through the pandemic
*26:52.620- 26:54.720* :  and people have really struggled financially.
*26:55.320- 26:59.000* :  And there's a real feeling that it's hard to afford a house,
*26:59.000- 27:01.820* :  not even factoring in that weddings
*27:01.820- 27:04.820* :  are big extravagant events that require a lot of money.
*27:05.380- 27:07.420* :  And again, that's another thing
*27:07.420- 27:08.940* :  that I see on social media platforms,
*27:08.940- 27:10.940* :  comments from social media users saying,
*27:11.840- 27:14.220* :  this is just a huge expense to even think about.
*27:14.220- 27:17.000* :  So they'd rather just accept love
*27:17.700- 27:19.740* :  in a much more kind of relaxed term
*27:19.780- 27:22.280* :  than tying the knot and getting into something
*27:22.320- 27:24.800* :  that they may regret further down the line.
*27:25.540- 27:26.120* :  Carrie Allen.
*27:27.620- 27:29.000* :  In England on Friday evening,
*27:29.000- 27:32.220* :  the first Premier League game of the season kicked off
*27:32.600- 27:35.280* :  with Manchester United beating Fullham 1-0,
*27:35.620- 27:38.680* :  a much anticipated event for fans across the world,
*27:39.360- 27:41.680* :  including followers of fantasy football.
*27:42.320- 27:43.800* :  What's that? Some of you may ask,
*27:43.900- 27:46.500* :  well, here's an explanation from self-declared
*27:46.500- 27:49.120* :  fantasy football fanatic Harvey Stevens.
*27:49.820- 27:52.140* :  Fantasy Football is a game where football fans
*27:52.140- 27:54.440* :  pick a team of 11 real-life footballers
*27:54.640- 27:56.680* :  who score points based on their performances.
*27:57.320- 28:00.700* :  For example, if I pick Manchester United's Marcus Rashford
*28:00.860- 28:02.060* :  and he scores a goal tonight,
*28:02.060- 28:03.420* :  he'll get me five points.
*28:03.420- 28:05.980* :  If he gets sent off, I'll be docked three.
*28:06.480- 28:07.920* :  There are various points for different
*28:07.920- 28:09.460* :  on-field situations like these.
*28:10.060- 28:11.900* :  You then join mini leagues with your friends
*28:11.900- 28:13.940* :  where your total points are tallied up
*28:14.220- 28:15.960* :  and I will no doubt come out victorious
*28:16.360- 28:17.420* :  in this year's mini league.
*28:17.920- 28:20.680* :  Well, that seems like good fun, then, or does it?
*28:21.020- 28:23.540* :  Turns out fantasy football can be good, bad,
*28:23.540- 28:25.520* :  and ugly for your mental health.
*28:25.980- 28:28.900* :  Dr. Gary Britain is a lecturer in psychology
*28:28.900- 28:31.280* :  at Queen Mary University of London.
*28:31.840- 28:34.040* :  He's been looking at fantasy football leagues
*28:34.040- 28:37.080* :  and how they can affect emotions and well-being.
*28:37.600- 28:39.640* :  He also plays fantasy football,
*28:40.120- 28:41.720* :  and Anita and Anne spoke to him
*28:41.720- 28:45.120* :  just before the fantasy football transfer window closed.
*28:45.920- 28:48.280* :  But first, what did his research reveal?
*28:49.020- 28:50.320* :  The main findings in the research
*28:50.320- 28:54.340* :  were the highest-invested group were more likely
*28:54.340- 28:57.040* :  to encounter problems with things like anxiety,
*28:57.780- 28:59.400* :  depression as a result of the game.
*28:59.900- 29:02.340* :  What could be quite relaxing for some people
*29:02.340- 29:04.840* :  actually is enormously stressful for us.
*29:04.840- 29:06.940* :  Yeah, the flip side of it wasn't mentioned
*29:06.940- 29:09.420* :  when the study was picked up by a lot of newspapers.
*29:09.800- 29:11.180* :  It's also the people who are more invested
*29:11.580- 29:13.100* :  actually get a lot more positive emotions as well.
*29:13.100- 29:14.840* :  So if their team does well,
*29:15.140- 29:16.380* :  they'll get more enjoyment out of it.
*29:16.400- 29:17.560* :  But when the team does badly,
*29:17.840- 29:19.700* :  and they're doing badly compared to their friends
*29:19.700- 29:21.920* :  or when they compare their teams to other people on Twitter,
*29:22.060- 29:23.720* :  it's going to make them feel a lot worse.
*29:24.180- 29:26.280* :  Like betting on the horses and studying the form,
*29:27.360- 29:28.600* :  making an informed decision.
*29:28.660- 29:29.900* :  Your team is a fantasy,
*29:29.900- 29:31.760* :  but the stats have to be very, very real.
*29:32.020- 29:32.480* :  Yes, yes.
*29:32.600- 29:35.660* :  Does it make a difference if money is involved or not?
*29:36.120- 29:38.620* :  The Premier League actually discourages people
*29:38.620- 29:41.140* :  from getting involved in what we call money leagues,
*29:41.140- 29:43.920* :  which is basically we've, say, 20 people at work.
*29:44.140- 29:45.700* :  For example, everyone puts a tenor in it,
*29:46.160- 29:48.120* :  and the winner takes, so I don't know,
*29:48.120- 29:49.040* :  a bit of a thousand pound, I guess,
*29:49.040- 29:50.200* :  if there was a hundred people in it,
*29:50.700- 29:52.740* :  there is a lot of people who do that.
*29:53.100- 29:56.360* :  What are the kinds of anxieties and the kind of stresses
*29:56.360- 29:58.080* :  that your research has turned out?
*29:58.680- 30:01.260* :  We also found that people who are more engaged,
*30:01.260- 30:06.340* :  for example, have more of a problematic work life balance
*30:06.340- 30:08.380* :  in relation to fantasy football.
*30:08.380- 30:09.900* :  So, for example, they report,
*30:10.540- 30:12.380* :  compared to play plays who are less engaged,
*30:12.380- 30:15.400* :  for example, having problems in their relationships
*30:15.400- 30:18.420* :  or focusing at work because of fantasy football.
*30:19.000- 30:21.080* :  Is it mostly a male thing,
*30:21.080- 30:23.280* :  a male preserve fantasy football or more women?
*30:23.280- 30:24.820* :  It was about 6% female.
*30:24.820- 30:26.980* :  6% out of 100.
*30:26.980- 30:29.620* :  So, certainly there are females that play it.
*30:29.760- 30:31.000* :  I mean, whether or not that would be reflective,
*30:31.000- 30:33.240* :  because that was, as I say, quite a...
*30:33.440- 30:34.200* :  Committed, but...
*30:34.200- 30:34.560* :  Committed, but, yeah.
*30:35.460- 30:37.140* :  Well, I mean, it's almost 6 o'clock,
*30:37.360- 30:39.120* :  and 630, the window closes.
*30:39.120- 30:42.180* :  So, around the country, around the world,
*30:42.180- 30:43.460* :  people playing fantasy football,
*30:43.460- 30:45.280* :  is this the most frenetic time?
*30:45.280- 30:47.240* :  And what are a lot of people going through right now?
*30:47.560- 30:50.140* :  Game week one is a time where you can still change around
*30:50.140- 30:50.680* :  all your players.
*30:50.740- 30:51.880* :  Usually on a week-bobby basis,
*30:51.880- 30:54.300* :  you can only make one transfer or use any one transfer.
*30:54.940- 30:58.860* :  So, it's quite frenetic trying to solidify your team.
*30:59.240- 31:00.840* :  And as somebody who's played it, you know,
*31:00.840- 31:03.120* :  seriously, and studied it, there's an academic feeling
*31:03.120- 31:04.320* :  a bit twitchy right now.
*31:04.600- 31:06.160* :  Are you happy with the team you've got?
*31:07.760- 31:08.780* :  Yeah. Fairly happy.
*31:09.420- 31:09.820* :  Fairly happy.
*31:09.860- 31:11.000* :  You took an age to one.
