*01:24.580- 01:30.260* :  I'm Andrew Pageant at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday, the 17th of July. These are our main stories.
*01:30.260- 01:34.560* :  The mayor of Paris goes for a swim in the river to prove it's safe for the Olympics.
*01:34.940- 01:42.540* :  It's amazing. You know, it was a dream for us. We work very hard. We did it. We did it.
*01:42.540- 01:47.560* :  Police in Thailand say six Vietnamese tourists found dead in a luxury hotel
*01:47.560- 01:54.160* :  were poisoned with cyanide and student protests in Bangladesh over a lack of jobs turn violent.
*01:56.480- 02:00.360* :  Also in this podcast, everyone's watching people in this sector of the world.
*02:01.200- 02:05.240* :  All eyes on Hezbollah are as fears grow on a new front in the Gaza war.
*02:08.300- 02:12.000* :  We'll start this podcast with a swim in the sand, the river that runs through Paris.
*02:12.000- 02:16.900* :  Residents have been using social media to criticise the government over plans to use the river
*02:16.900- 02:22.600* :  during the Olympic Games, saying it's far too dirty. Now, the mayor of Paris and Idalgo
*02:22.900- 02:26.920* :  has taken decisive action during a swimsuit and taking the plunge quite literally
*02:27.260- 02:28.880* :  in front of cheering spectators.
*02:34.040- 02:38.360* :  After it, she said her hard work and an estimated 1.5 billion dollars
*02:38.360- 02:43.080* :  cleaning up the river had paid off. It's amazing. You know, it was a dream for us.
*02:43.140- 02:53.120* :  We work a lot and very hard for that and it is not just for be here today and swim together.
*02:53.140- 03:01.760* :  It's a very lucky and happy day. It's also for the planet, you know, and for the river and for the ocean.
*03:02.920- 03:05.120* :  We did it. We did it.
*03:05.320- 03:10.100* :  And the mayor wasn't the only one taking a dip. Our Paris Correspondent Huseko filled it too.
*03:10.500- 03:14.820* :  I did indeed and it was great. Every adjective she used to praise the experience was well
*03:14.820- 03:20.060* :  merited. It was a lovely occasion. The water was warm, felt clean and it was great. I mean,
*03:20.060- 03:21.820* :  if that was really liberating, wonderful moment.
*03:22.200- 03:26.700* :  Is it something that people commonly do swim in the river in Paris for people listening
*03:26.700- 03:31.620* :  elsewhere around the world? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. I mean, it's been banned for a century.
*03:31.620- 03:36.880* :  It was banned in 1923. There have been, in the last year, occasional experiments. People
*03:36.880- 03:43.000* :  get in a couple of competitions last year to just test the waters, literally ahead of the Olympics.
*03:43.000- 03:48.020* :  But basically, a ban is still in place and no, no one swims in the river because of pollution,
*03:48.020- 03:53.300* :  but also the risk of current. It's not necessarily very safe. But the fact is that it has been
*03:53.300- 03:57.060* :  cleaned up. That's a process that goes back many, many years, not just for the Olympics.
*03:57.540- 04:02.500* :  And now with the Olympics approaching, they pushed that cleanup process to its conclusion,
*04:02.500- 04:07.140* :  which is to create the fact now that it is in general safe to get in.
*04:07.440- 04:12.740* :  There were problems and worries because levels of bacteria were very high up to the last minute
*04:12.740- 04:17.660* :  because of very heavy rainfall, which is part of the problem where it causes, you know, a human
*04:17.660- 04:22.880* :  affluent to go. I mean, in great quantities. But now, with impeccable timing, it's come good.
*04:23.320- 04:26.920* :  And obviously it's going to be a kind of showpiece moment to have some of the Olympic
*04:26.920- 04:30.820* :  events in the river in the central of the city. This is why it's a huge relief because,
*04:31.460- 04:36.120* :  you know, part of the great pitch for Paris was we will be using this really claimed river as
*04:36.480- 04:39.760* :  a centerpiece for some of the swimming events, the marathon and the triathlon and so on,
*04:40.060- 04:46.020* :  the swimming marathon. And that was at risk. And there was an awful fear. One of the great
*04:46.020- 04:50.920* :  kind of showcases of the Olympics would be just canceled because the river would not be safe
*04:50.920- 04:55.560* :  enough to get into. It looks like now things are going to be fine. So any daggers euphoria is
*04:55.560- 05:00.540* :  well understandable because it's not just that the river has been reclaimed for the city,
*05:00.540- 05:05.740* :  it's also that the Olympic Games can go ahead as planned. He's going to be drying off in Paris.
*05:06.300- 05:07.500* :  Next to Australia.
*05:13.760- 05:18.700* :  And these are sounds from a ceremony in Canberra marking the 10th anniversary of the moment
*05:18.700- 05:25.440* :  a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people
*05:25.440- 05:31.200* :  on board. 38 of them were Australian. The aircraft was struck by a Russian-made missile over
*05:31.200- 05:36.120* :  separatist held pro-Russian territory. The Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese promised
*05:36.120- 05:39.400* :  that his government would continue to pursue justice for those who died.
*05:39.960- 05:46.820* :  On this anniversary, where Mark Draper's our attorney general is in the height as we speak,
*05:47.340- 05:55.260* :  again, advancing Australia's national interest, expressing our concern at the need to hold
*05:55.260- 06:00.240* :  Russia to account who've been found to be responsible for this tragedy.
*06:00.800- 06:06.140* :  Flight MH17 was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was destroyed in midair
*06:06.140- 06:11.760* :  and the Netherlands bore the brunt of the disaster. 196 Dutch people were among those killed.
*06:12.240- 06:17.540* :  So the anniversary is also being marked there. A correspondent in Amsterdam Anaholegan has
*06:17.540- 06:22.640* :  been telling me how. Let me tell you about where I am. It may be a bit breezy. We're a few kilometers
*06:22.640- 06:29.760* :  away from Skippel Airport at the MH17 National Monument Site. And I'm walking past rows and rows
*06:29.760- 06:37.120* :  of trees. 298 trees planted. One to represent every passenger, every crew member who was on board
*06:37.120- 06:44.180* :  Flight MH17. There are flags flying at half mast and I'm just on the edge of a vast sunflower
*06:44.180- 06:50.700* :  field. Sunflowers planted here to represent the fields in eastern Ukraine where Flight MH17
*06:51.680- 06:57.080* :  came down. I'm looking around and there are people who have travelled from all over the world.
*06:57.080- 07:04.800* :  We're expecting 1,300 relatives of the victims to be here for this ceremony to mark the 10-year
*07:05.260- 07:11.600* :  anniversary. I've just been watching an orchestra warm up, Andrew and LED lit marquee at the side
*07:11.600- 07:18.680* :  of a stage. Inside an amphitheater, the stage is shaped like an eye looking up to the sky.
*07:19.240- 07:24.540* :  And every now and then you hear a plane going past to and from Skippel Airport. That's where
*07:24.540- 07:31.940* :  Flight MH17 set off from 10 years ago today. People are gathering their laying sunflowers by each
*07:31.940- 07:37.180* :  of the trees and many of these trees, well, all of them have plaques attached with a name and an
*07:37.180- 07:44.340* :  age of the person that tree was planted for. And it's just a reminder of walking around this vast
*07:44.340- 07:51.120* :  site of those people who were on board, but also so many of them were so young, 80 children were on
*07:51.120- 07:57.220* :  board Flight MH17. And for the families who come here to mark this moment, I just spoke to
*07:57.220- 08:03.200* :  Hans de Boerst, who's 17-year-old daughter, Elsameek was on board. He said this is a moment to
*08:03.200- 08:07.160* :  remember, but also to remember that we are still waiting for truth and accountability.
*08:07.940- 08:13.520* :  It's such a huge number of people, 196. It's a real scar on the history of the Netherlands.
*08:13.520- 08:19.120* :  Just update us on the legal case and where that's got to in 10 years.
*08:20.160- 08:25.300* :  There are a few different legal proceedings ongoing. The criminal trial was conducted by the
*08:25.300- 08:30.320* :  Netherlands in a Dutch court. It lasted for more than two years. The Dutch court
*08:30.320- 08:36.060* :  convicted two Russians and pro-Russian Ukrainian in absentia of merger for their roles in transporting
*08:36.060- 08:42.420* :  the surface to air missile from Russia into the separatist control territory in eastern Ukraine.
*08:42.420- 08:47.080* :  They were given life prison sentences, but they, of course, remain at large because Russia
*08:47.080- 08:52.440* :  refused to cooperate, refused to surrender them to face trial. One of the Russian was acquitted
*08:52.440- 08:57.200* :  and Russia has always denied any responsibility. There is other legal action under way, though,
*08:57.200- 09:01.620* :  the European Court of Human Rights, the International Civil Aviation Organization Council,
*09:02.620- 09:08.740* :  which the Netherlands hopes will hold Russia to account under international law for the attack.
*09:09.840- 09:16.340* :  If those organisations do rule that Moscow was responsible for all of these relatives,
*09:16.340- 09:20.200* :  it would be a moment to celebrate, but today is a moment to remember.
*09:20.980- 09:26.100* :  And a hologon with me from Amsterdam. In Thailand, more details have been emerging about the
*09:26.100- 09:32.040* :  mysterious deaths of six people found at an exclusive hotel in Bangkok. It had been suspected
*09:32.040- 09:37.620* :  they died from poisoning. Nolper Sin Ponsua, the Deputy Police Chief of Bangkok, has been speaking
*09:37.620- 09:49.660* :  at a news conference. He told reporters one of the six calls this by using cyanide
*09:50.100- 09:55.160* :  and this case is a personal matter among those six individuals, not anything to do with a gang
*09:55.160- 10:00.120* :  or organised crime in Thailand. I've been finding out more from our correspondent, Nick Marsh,
*10:00.120- 10:05.660* :  in Singapore. I just take you to the beginning. This is the Grand Hyatt, five-star hotel in the
*10:05.660- 10:13.660* :  centre of Bangkok. On Monday, this group of six people, all Vietnamese, they all knew each other.
*10:14.320- 10:22.320* :  They ordered food and tea to one of the sweets. Then the next day, housekeeping, found them all dead.
*10:23.120- 10:27.840* :  How have the authorities worked out? This was a poisoning. So initially, local media said
*10:27.840- 10:32.140* :  there'd been a shooting. That seemed to be the case for a while. We don't really know where this
*10:32.140- 10:38.360* :  shooting rumor, I suppose, came from, but eventually they did some toxicology tests because
*10:38.360- 10:44.580* :  they had found no signs of struggle or fighting. They found cyanide or a cyanide-like substance
*10:45.380- 10:52.180* :  in the victim's blood and on the tea cups from which they had drunk and also possibly a water
*10:52.740- 10:56.900* :  container. The food was completely untouched by the way, so that's what the police are now saying.
*10:57.420- 11:03.320* :  All six were poisoned, but they think one of them was actually the perpetrator.
*11:04.140- 11:09.760* :  And the police have developed a theory that it was some kind of debt problem that lay behind all
*11:09.760- 11:15.620* :  this. Exactly. And the way they got to this theory was by intervening relatives of the victims
*11:15.620- 11:23.440* :  in Vietnam. The what the police in Thailand are saying now is that two of the six were a couple who
*11:23.440- 11:29.540* :  owned a road construction business. They gave money to another part of the group of six,
*11:29.540- 11:35.120* :  Cherine Chong. They gave her this money to invest in a hospital building project in Japan,
*11:35.120- 11:40.420* :  and the police are talking about tens of millions of parts, which when you consider 10 million
*11:40.420- 11:46.780* :  baht is around 200,000, quarter of a million US dollars, that is a lot of money that we're talking
*11:46.780- 11:55.840* :  about. And it appears that this investment went wrong. Cherine Chong owed a huge amount of money,
*11:55.840- 12:01.760* :  and therefore she is the suspect now that the police are talking about. And is this being
*12:01.760- 12:06.300* :  widely reported in Bangkok with a lot of different theories about what might have happened?
*12:06.740- 12:10.500* :  It absolutely is, yeah. I mean, to give you an idea of how big this story is in Thailand,
*12:10.500- 12:15.680* :  the Prime Minister was actually on the scene. Within hours last night, he actually went to the hotel,
*12:16.380- 12:21.780* :  spoke to the media, which is slightly unusual. You don't normally see leaders of countries
*12:21.780- 12:26.880* :  going straight to a crime scene, especially when there's still an active investigation going on.
*12:27.780- 12:32.840* :  One of the six, by the way, is a very well-known celebrity makeup artist. He's got a really big
*12:32.840- 12:39.540* :  following online, not just in Vietnam, but across Asia. There was a real big outpouring of condolence
*12:39.820- 12:44.860* :  for him. And then like I said, as these details begin to emerge, you know, you can see why there
*12:44.860- 12:49.080* :  is a lot of interest, not just in Thailand, but we're talking about it internationally, aren't we?
*12:49.520- 12:55.520* :  Marsh with me from Singapore. Students protesting in Bangladesh over a controversial quota system
*12:55.520- 13:00.380* :  for government jobs have vowed to continue their demonstrations until they receive an apology
*13:00.380- 13:05.560* :  for comments made by the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina. She used a derogatory term that implies
*13:05.560- 13:11.180* :  they are collaborators, like those who helped or supported Pakistan's army during Bangladesh's
*13:11.180- 13:17.040* :  independence war in 1971. Demonstrations are being going on for a fortnight as Akbar Hussein
*13:17.040- 13:23.000* :  reports from Dhaka. The protest it has now intensified because the government has instructed
*13:23.500- 13:29.220* :  all schools and universities to shut down for indefinite period. And these has created
*13:29.220- 13:33.960* :  father anger. The students say that in some universities, they say that, you know, they will not
*13:33.960- 13:39.980* :  go out of their dormitories because they are demanding to bring an amendment in the quota system,
*13:39.980- 13:44.880* :  which is very discriminatory. But on the other hand, government is not listening to their voices.
*13:44.880- 13:51.360* :  These has created huge anger and frustration. And the protest was basically peaceful. We have
*13:51.360- 13:56.820* :  seen it in the last two weeks. But it actually triggered protest and more violence because when
*13:56.820- 14:02.680* :  the Prime Minister made, as you said earlier, made a comment that the protesters are the grandchildren
*14:02.680- 14:09.560* :  of Razakar. And Razakar is a very derogatory word. And Razakar was a paramilitary force in 1971,
*14:09.560- 14:14.340* :  who actually collaborated with Pakistan army during Bangladesh's war of independence.
*14:14.780- 14:19.060* :  So these words are very, very sensitive. And that's why they have been protesting. And yesterday,
*14:19.060- 14:25.160* :  what we saw on the streets, that six people were killed by police bullet. Now, the question is,
*14:25.160- 14:30.900* :  why the protest has become so powerful? Because we haven't seen such a powerful protest in the last
*14:30.900- 14:36.860* :  six, seven years in Bangladesh. And many analysts believe that this is an accumulated frustration
*14:36.860- 14:42.380* :  of young generation. Because many believe that, you know, Bangladesh is now as a one-party state.
*14:42.380- 14:47.480* :  The country has had three faulty election. Many people believe that they don't have freedom
*14:47.480- 14:51.560* :  of expression. That's why the students are protesting and it is getting intensified.
*14:52.520- 14:58.220* :  With no end in sight for the war in Gaza, many eyes have been on the Lebanese arm group Hezbollah
*14:58.220- 15:03.820* :  and how their involvement could exacerbate the conflict. Hezbollah is aligned with Iran and has
*15:03.820- 15:09.220* :  far more military might than Hamas. It's been trading fire with Israel for the past nine months
*15:09.220- 15:16.260* :  and says it's supporting Palestinians in Gaza. So far, 466 people have been killed in Lebanon
*15:16.260- 15:22.700* :  in Israel. The death toll is 33, mainly soldiers. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*15:22.700- 15:27.820* :  has said it Hezbollah opened a war front with Israel. It would lead to counter strikes of
*15:27.820- 15:33.400* :  unimaginable magnitude. Our senior international correspondent Al-Agerin reports from southern
*15:38.420- 15:44.160* :  Lebanon. UN peacekeepers on patrol and on alert in the heartland of Hezbollah.
*15:45.040- 15:50.820* :  We joined them heading for the blue line, Lebanon's unofficial border with Israel,
*15:51.560- 16:02.400* :  already a battleground. We're driving through a village called Yarun. We've just passed a
*16:02.400- 16:08.700* :  corner where you can see there's been an airstrike or what looks like an airstrike, several buildings
*16:09.780- 16:18.460* :  brought down, reduced to rubble. And the fear is the worry is that the conflict between Hezbollah
*16:18.660- 16:20.940* :  and Israel could escalate.
*16:26.220- 16:31.080* :  So where are we talking? So all you're here in the outskirts of the village called Yarun?
*16:31.900- 16:36.900* :  Lieutenant Colonel Tom Foxx leads the Irish peacekeeping forces here.
*16:37.780- 16:42.220* :  Overall, it has been tense and unpredictable for the period of time we have been here.
*16:42.720- 16:49.340* :  The farmers in the fields there are no longer crops have been destroyed as result of bushfires,
*16:49.340- 16:53.960* :  resulting from the exchanges of the fire. How far are we now from the blue line?
*16:54.820- 16:58.240* :  From where you're currently standing, you're approximately four to five hundred meters from
*16:58.240- 17:03.100* :  the blue line. And I presume the Israelis are watching us now. Everyone's watching people
*17:03.460- 17:04.560* :  in this sector of the world.
*17:09.260- 17:16.900* :  The international community is watching, as some in South Lebanon are grieving, like Hussein
*17:16.900- 17:24.960* :  Sakaiki. Sally, she was loved all the people. His only daughter Sally was killed last month
*17:25.440- 17:33.140* :  on her own doorstep in an Israeli airstrike. She was 25 and a volunteer paramedic.
*17:34.340- 17:41.180* :  Sally, she was everything for me. Like, I was always called her my life.
*17:42.820- 17:49.040* :  Every time I didn't call her Sally, my life only. All is called her like this.
*17:50.260- 17:53.920* :  Do you feel like the war is coming closer? Is getting worse?
*17:54.260- 17:56.220* :  Yeah. Yes.
*17:57.660- 18:01.300* :  After he said yes, we were interrupted by a boom.
*18:03.620- 18:09.920* :  Oh, stuck, every day. Many times, every day.
*18:10.600- 18:18.520* :  This time, no airstrike, just an Israeli warplane breaking the sound barrier, a weapon of fear.
*18:18.860- 18:29.400* :  And his baller has been deploying its weapons, firing rockets and missiles into Northern Israel.
*18:32.300- 18:36.540* :  The Iranian-backed group has more arms than many countries.
*18:43.920- 18:46.160* :  And a growing list of war heroes.
*18:47.800- 18:53.920* :  This was the funeral in Beirut for a senior Hezbollah commander killed by Israel.
*18:58.580- 19:02.600* :  Among the mourners, we met Hussein, a 35-year-old nurse.
*19:04.020- 19:10.100* :  We are not afraid. In fact, we are longing for an all-out war.
*19:11.060- 19:15.820* :  Young or old, we will take part in this war, if it's forced upon us.
*19:18.240- 19:23.080* :  This is a show of grief and a vanguard, but it's also a show of strength.
*19:23.080- 19:30.320* :  For months now, Hezbollah has been burying fighters, but it has many more to take their place.
*19:30.800- 19:37.540* :  And if there is an all-out war with Israel, Hezbollah will be a far more formidable enemy than Hamas.
*19:42.020- 19:47.080* :  As Bola says, if there's a ceasefire in Gaza, it will cease fire.
*19:49.460- 19:55.620* :  But an all-out war here could draw in Iranian-backed militant groups in Iraq and Yemen,
*19:56.280- 19:58.020* :  and set the region a light.
*20:03.960- 20:06.800* :  Our senior international correspondent Allegar in reporting.
*20:09.800- 20:10.940* :  Still to come in this podcast?
*20:11.760- 20:14.820* :  And I use a lot of my ancestors sample their real voices.
*20:18.820- 20:22.100* :  What Afro-futurism means for Africans around the world.
*20:30.060- 20:30.780* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*20:30.780- 20:34.740* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*20:35.040- 20:37.400* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*20:37.740- 20:41.340* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*20:41.340- 20:45.140* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*20:45.420- 20:50.400* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*21:01.420- 21:04.160* :  I'm Katrina Perry from the Global Story podcast.
*21:04.160- 21:09.060* :  I'm at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee for a defining moment in the U.S.
*21:09.060- 21:14.120* :  presidential race after an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.
*21:14.640- 21:18.260* :  Republican and Democratic leadership have called for unity and calm,
*21:18.600- 21:21.160* :  but does that match the device of public mood?
*21:21.700- 21:25.040* :  The Global Story brings you fresh takes and smart perspectives.
*21:25.480- 21:27.060* :  Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
*21:36.740- 21:41.520* :  Now, once upon a time, the tech billionaire Elon Musk said he'd prefer to stay out of politics,
*21:41.520- 21:44.680* :  but just days after endorsing Donald Trump for president,
*21:44.680- 21:49.160* :  he's announced he's moving to of his most high-profile companies out of California
*21:49.620- 21:51.540* :  because of LGBTQ legislation.
*21:52.080- 21:56.620* :  The new law signed on Monday bound schools from requiring staff to disclose information
*21:56.620- 22:00.200* :  about a child's gender identity, including to their parents.
*22:00.740- 22:02.980* :  Our reporter Ella Bicknell spoke to Bernadette Kio.
*22:03.520- 22:06.860* :  California is often deemed one of America's more liberal states,
*22:06.860- 22:10.720* :  and this law was put forward by the Democrat-dominated state legislature.
*22:10.860- 22:14.740* :  And it was signed on Monday by the Democrat state governor, Gavin Newsom.
*22:14.740- 22:21.380* :  This law states that from January 2025, if a LGBTQ student reveals their sexual orientation
*22:21.380- 22:27.140* :  or their gender identity to a teacher, that teacher cannot be forced to tell that student's parents.
*22:27.260- 22:31.540* :  A school can only share that information if the student gives their consent.
*22:31.640- 22:36.500* :  The state governor office says this bill keeps children safe from preventing politicians
*22:36.500- 22:40.900* :  and school staff from inappropriately intervening in family matters.
*22:41.500- 22:43.700* :  But others, including Elon Musk, for example,
*22:43.700- 22:47.760* :  argue that it stops parents from knowing what's happening with their children,
*22:48.060- 22:50.240* :  which they say is their parental right.
*22:51.260- 22:54.760* :  So what's all this got to do with him leaving California for Texas?
*22:55.340- 23:00.500* :  Well, it was on ex that he called this bill a final straw, and that in his view,
*23:00.500- 23:05.940* :  it will cause massive destruction of parental rights and put children at risk of permanent damage.
*23:06.540- 23:09.980* :  And because of that SpaceX, which is his rocket manufacturing company,
*23:09.980- 23:14.040* :  they'll move their headquarters from California to starbase in Texas.
*23:14.060- 23:19.460* :  And also his social media platform X will be moved from San Francisco to the city of Austin,
*23:19.680- 23:20.580* :  also in Texas.
*23:21.200- 23:25.040* :  Now, when it comes to LGBTQ issues, Elon Musk's daughter is transgender.
*23:25.800- 23:30.540* :  And he says he supports trans issues, but he has been criticized by LGBTQ groups
*23:30.540- 23:32.280* :  in the past for mocking pronouns.
*23:32.280- 23:35.340* :  In one tweet, he called them an aesthetic nightmare.
*23:36.060- 23:40.380* :  If this California excess really does go ahead, it will certainly be the strongest stance we've
*23:40.380- 23:45.900* :  ever seen him take on this topic. SpaceX employs 5,000 people across the state,
*23:45.900- 23:50.840* :  and to pull a major tech company like X out of the powerhouse, which is Silicon Valley.
*23:51.340- 23:52.320* :  It's no small feat.
*23:52.320- 23:57.380* :  However, Benadette Musk has had a long love hate relationship with California.
*23:57.860- 24:01.480* :  The years now, he's been at loggerheads with the state government over numerous issues,
*24:01.480- 24:02.720* :  largely regulation.
*24:03.240- 24:08.880* :  COVID-19 restrictions were part of his reason why he moved Tesla's headquarters to Austin in 2021.
*24:09.660- 24:15.000* :  And also, Elon Musk mainly resides in Texas, which, unlike California, has no income tax.
*24:15.900- 24:16.760* :  Arabic nor reporting.
*24:17.420- 24:23.260* :  Now, eating a late evening meal is part of Spanish culture for sure, but is the habit of eating at 10 pm
*24:23.260- 24:28.720* :  on the threat. Recently, the second deputy minister of Spain called it madness saying
*24:28.720- 24:32.400* :  eating late and working late isn't good for work-life balance.
*24:32.880- 24:33.680* :  Halema Lane reports.
*24:37.240- 24:41.720* :  I'm watching a video from Mikhail Vignesbre. He's the co-founder of the Segardi group,
*24:42.080- 24:45.640* :  and he has a number of Spanish restaurants across Spain as well as other parts of the world.
*24:54.080- 24:57.780* :  His kitchens are open late into the evening, like most other Spanish restaurants.
*24:57.820- 25:00.480* :  But recently, there's been talk of that changing.
*25:00.480- 25:05.100* :  Yolanda Diaz, the second deputy minister in Spain, has been making her views known.
*25:09.100- 25:13.560* :  She says it's unreasonable that people convene meetings in Spain at 8 pm,
*25:13.560- 25:16.780* :  and it's unreasonable for restaurants to be open at 1 o'clock in the morning.
*25:17.720- 25:21.880* :  She clearly wants restaurants to close earlier, but for Mikhail, he's opening at the time that
*25:21.880- 25:22.900* :  his customers want.
*25:27.580- 25:31.460* :  She's getting dinner with getting dark, and second is the weather conditions,
*25:31.460- 25:34.840* :  because temperatures here are higher than in much of Europe.
*25:35.240- 25:38.780* :  People tend to avoid going outside during the hottest part of the day.
*25:39.100- 25:45.240* :  Maria Ramirez is deputy managing editor of ldrio.es and online news outlet in Spain.
*25:45.440- 25:50.140* :  It's kind of difficult because everything sort of pushes you to work late.
*25:50.820- 25:57.280* :  Most of the meetings that you have tend to just push the whole working day till late.
*25:57.880- 26:02.960* :  Spain has one of the longest working days in Europe, but working longer hasn't led to being more
*26:02.960- 26:09.700* :  productive. According to the Bank of Spain, productivity per hour worked is 10-15% lower than the rest
*26:09.700- 26:15.300* :  of the Eurozone, and has been that way since 2008. Would Yolanda Diaz be able to convince Spanish
*26:15.300- 26:21.220* :  people, even the younger generation, that restaurants should close earlier, journalist Maria Ramirez?
*26:21.540- 26:28.160* :  What I think is that it's interesting that the debate is open again, and some companies,
*26:29.080- 26:37.000* :  some businesses are already making those changes, so probably it could be more impactful if some of
*26:37.000- 26:44.360* :  the just larger companies in Spain, or even just smaller businesses, do the changes themselves,
*26:44.700- 26:49.040* :  and see there is a positive impact for the workers and also for the customers.
*26:49.680- 26:54.380* :  Hannibalaine reporting. Rugby is popular in many countries, but recently in the UK,
*26:54.380- 26:58.200* :  the toll it takes on players has been examined more closely than ever.
*26:58.740- 27:02.960* :  Now, new research from Durham University has been looking at players who suffered
*27:02.960- 27:08.840* :  multiple concussions. Port Chazo is a pharmacologist from the Department of Biosciences at Durham,
*27:08.840- 27:13.420* :  and co-author of the study. He told us what they found in the blood of players who'd been
*27:13.420- 27:19.160* :  concussed several times. What we're looking at is proteins that are not normally there,
*27:19.160- 27:23.300* :  if you like. They should be at relatively low levels normally, and what we've found is that
*27:23.300- 27:28.640* :  there's elevated levels of certain proteins within bloods that indicate some problems within the
*27:28.640- 27:34.400* :  brain, and similarly, they're changing another protein that's reduced, indicates that there's
*27:34.400- 27:40.820* :  a misfunction, and this could potentially in time lead to further problems like neurodegenerative
*27:41.260- 27:46.260* :  diseases. Alex Popham is a former Welsh international rugby player and co-founder of the charity
*27:46.260- 27:50.160* :  Head for Change. He's been talking to Mother Carney about the new research.
*27:50.740- 27:56.740* :  I think it's very positive that research is being done, but it has been done over the decades,
*27:56.740- 28:04.020* :  and more recently a study with Daniel Bailey in Cardiff University showed current players
*28:04.720- 28:10.340* :  having damage after one season of play in the Drake Foundation. On current players again,
*28:10.340- 28:18.520* :  show 23% of them had brain abnormalities after a season. But the changes need to happen,
*28:18.700- 28:25.320* :  and we've got to not stop doing research, but action needs to be taken and changes to the game
*28:25.320- 28:30.540* :  and training when there is a traumatic brain injury, a play, a risen rushback.
*28:31.280- 28:33.400* :  What kind of changes would you like to see?
*28:33.620- 28:38.180* :  Well, the majority of the things I think that would make a difference on Monday to Friday,
*28:38.180- 28:43.400* :  so the mandatory amounts of contact in training at the moment, there's only guidelines.
*28:43.400- 28:50.380* :  The NFL brought in 14 years ago that there allowed 14 padded contact sessions. That can happen
*28:50.380- 28:57.140* :  in six weeks in rugby. When there is a traumatic brain injury, a player with the loop holes can be
*28:57.500- 29:03.460* :  playing again in seven days. The same injury in boxing. The boxer wouldn't be allowed to fight for
*29:03.460- 29:09.860* :  three months, so that's pretty crazy. And then we would like for professional players to have
*29:09.860- 29:17.220* :  an annual medical, and included in that medical would be a DTI, diffusion tensor, imaging scan,
*29:17.220- 29:24.320* :  and if you have those three things in place, rugby would be a lot safer tomorrow. But unfortunately,
*29:25.280- 29:29.040* :  because of the legal case, they won't make the changes that need to happen.
*29:29.180- 29:33.220* :  It's difficult for us to get into the details of that lawsuit at the moment.
*29:33.320- 29:37.800* :  But let me put to you what the rugby establishment has been saying,
*29:37.800- 29:42.340* :  World Rugby had been saying, we never stand still when it comes to further cementing rugby
*29:42.800- 29:47.800* :  as the most progressive sport on athlete welfare. Acting on the latest science,
*29:47.800- 29:51.200* :  we constantly strive to safeguard and support all our players.
*29:52.480- 29:55.980* :  They've been saying that sentence for the last four years since I got diagnosed,
*29:56.300- 30:02.420* :  the changes that have been made are all smoke and mirrors. There's no real change that is happening,
*30:02.420- 30:10.680* :  even the gun shields they brought out last year. Robby Henshaw and Irish Centre recorded a hit over 75
*30:10.680- 30:17.480* :  G-force, and he stayed on the pitch for another 25 minutes before he was assessed at half time and
*30:17.480- 30:22.080* :  then got taken off. Anything could have happened in that 25 minutes. You could have had a second
*30:22.080- 30:27.800* :  impact, which could have been very, very dangerous. And that was the former World
*30:27.800- 30:33.580* :  Rugby International Alex Popham talking to Martha Carney. Let's end this podcast with a question.
*30:33.580- 30:39.140* :  What is Afro-futurism? Some describe it as an intersection of imagination, technology,
*30:39.140- 30:44.920* :  the future and liberation. Others say it's a cultural aesthetic that combines science fiction,
*30:44.920- 30:50.980* :  history and fantasy. Essentially, it's literature, art or music, and its purposes to explore the
*30:50.980- 30:56.980* :  African-American experience. Chan-Borne musician Caleb Rinto Bay goes by the name of Afro-Tronics,
*30:57.560- 30:59.820* :  my colleague Daniel Yevetska. Course up with him.
*31:16.680- 31:24.560* :  I'll call it an electro-Sahara blues, or maybe globally, I would say, electro-tribal based on
*31:24.700- 31:31.240* :  Afro-futurism philosophy. Tell us about that. There are several groups that have used this as a concept,
*31:31.240- 31:38.880* :  but what do you mean by Afro-futurism? The way I define Afro-futurism is looking for a future that
*31:39.080- 31:46.240* :  looks like as that fits our needs. So, statistically, I'm doing all this work of going back to who
*31:47.300- 31:50.340* :  and I use a lot of my ancestors sample their real voices.
*32:08.080- 32:11.960* :  You've lived in Montreal now for a while. Can you tell us more about your reasons for moving
*32:11.960- 32:20.560* :  from Chad to Canada? Yeah, that's not a very happy reasons. Already, when I was young, I started
*32:20.560- 32:26.780* :  engaging into some subject that are forbidden to talk about it in Chad, and so that's why it
*32:26.900- 32:32.940* :  took me to Canada. So, I had a song that is, and I'm not allowed to play, and I did it once,
*32:33.520- 32:39.600* :  so I wasn't allowed to come back. But this president is there, now we have his song, so yeah.
*32:39.920- 32:46.880* :  But now I came. I'm almost six, six months a year in Chad, and that's where I feed even my
*32:46.960- 32:50.360* :  spiritual everything that comes in my music, came from there.
*33:00.780- 33:06.720* :  We have interviewed some Maliian musicians, one we've been here. Mali is noted for many musicians,
*33:06.920- 33:13.460* :  and Chad, perhaps, doesn't quite have the same global reputation yet for music. But you seem
*33:13.460- 33:20.220* :  to have single-handedly managed to find a voice for it, a space for it. What does that feel like
*33:21.120- 33:25.900* :  for you, and how do you think that impacts other Chadian musicians? I just have this
*33:26.960- 33:31.500* :  pressure of the politicians, because I'm the very first one to do it that big,
*33:32.280- 33:39.720* :  I'm a sort of bono of Chad, and so we are trying to define what is the star system in Chad.
*33:41.180- 33:46.400* :  I just discovered in 2018 that I was that popular, when I get there, there was hundreds of people,
*33:46.400- 33:50.540* :  the airport, I didn't know, and that's the president coming, so I was waiting, they're like,
*33:50.620- 33:56.700* :  but people are waiting for you. But I'm trying to define what is close to us, not just follow
*33:57.640- 34:03.240* :  the other examples, or Western model, trying to be far away from bling bling, and all these
*34:03.280- 34:09.760* :  codes that we already know. Now there is a couple young singers, crazy, amazing, that are coming,
*34:09.760- 34:18.280* :  but they have this deep concern about what to be popular, what it is, so what do you live behind?
*34:19.140- 34:21.460* :  So yeah, I'm happy that I got this impact.
*34:34.480- 34:39.020* :  The Chadball musician Caleb Rinto Bay, ending that report by Daniel Javjetzka.
*34:41.280- 34:45.000* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
