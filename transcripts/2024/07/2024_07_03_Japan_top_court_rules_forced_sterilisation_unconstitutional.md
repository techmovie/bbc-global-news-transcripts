*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,

*01:23.160- 01:29.820* :  I'm Janet Gillil and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 3rd of July, these are our main stories.
*01:30.480- 01:35.680* :  Japan Supreme Court rules that thousands of disabled people who are forcibly sterilized
*01:35.860- 01:37.340* :  can claim compensation.
*01:38.260- 01:43.200* :  With more than 120 people now said to have been crushed to death at a religious gathering
*01:43.200- 01:46.060* :  in India, could more have been done to save them.
*01:46.800- 01:52.480* :  The United Nations says aid sent to the people of Sudan has been looted on an industrial
*01:52.480- 01:54.380* :  scale by the warring parties.
*01:57.060- 02:03.440* :  Also in this podcast, a mother says she killed her terminally ill seven-year-old son to end
*02:03.460- 02:04.160* :  his suffering.
*02:04.520- 02:07.080* :  I said, would you like me to remove the pain?
*02:07.720- 02:12.380* :  And he said, please, my mom, I gave him a large dose of morphine.
*02:13.560- 02:17.440* :  And the controversy over the eSports World Cup in Saudi Arabia.
*02:22.260- 02:25.480* :  Yumi Suzuki was born with cerebral palsy.
*02:26.000- 02:32.480* :  When she was just 12 years old, she was forcibly sterilized under a Japanese eugenics law which
*02:32.480- 02:38.140* :  saw thousands of people sterilized against their will for decades until as recently as
*02:38.140- 02:39.300* :  the 1990s.
*02:40.140- 02:45.940* :  Now at the age of 68, she has finally received a measure of justice.
*02:46.480- 02:51.340* :  In a landmark ruling, the Japanese Supreme Court has ordered the government to pay compensation
*02:51.340- 02:54.080* :  to her and ten other plaintiffs.
*02:54.740- 02:57.820* :  Here she is speaking to the BBC in 2021.
*03:00.820- 03:04.900* :  When I found out I realized I could never be a mother, it broke my heart.
*03:05.600- 03:09.000* :  I faced discrimination from when I was small that this was very different.
*03:09.800- 03:14.800* :  I don't want money, I want people to know what happened to us, to make sure it never
*03:14.800- 03:15.740* :  happens again.
*03:16.560- 03:19.700* :  I want people with disabilities to be treated equally.
*03:20.180- 03:22.240* :  We're not things, we're human beings.
*03:24.760- 03:29.800* :  The Court has also ruled that Japan's 20-year statute of limitations does not apply in
*03:29.800- 03:34.300* :  such cases, paving the way for many more people to seek redress.
*03:34.680- 03:37.400* :  Our age of specific erasier Michael Bristo told us more.
*03:38.120- 03:42.060* :  I think it's first of all worthwhile looking a little bit of a background, it's a complicated
*03:42.100- 03:42.520* :  case.
*03:42.760- 03:47.940* :  As you mentioned there, it's about a terrible eugenics policy, discredited policy which was
*03:47.940- 03:51.860* :  enforced in Japan between 1948 and 1996.
*03:52.600- 03:57.680* :  In that period, 16,000 people were forcibly sterilized against their will.
*03:58.000- 04:03.240* :  These were people with mental illnesses, hereditary diseases, sometimes even just intellectually
*04:03.780- 04:04.160* :  limited.
*04:04.720- 04:07.980* :  Sometimes, they went into say, orphanages and things like that.
*04:07.980- 04:13.020* :  All these people were sterilized, another 8,000 actually were sterilized, it's thought
*04:13.020- 04:15.040* :  because they were forced into making this decision.
*04:15.120- 04:18.240* :  We're looking at about 25,000 people.
*04:18.240- 04:23.160* :  A couple of years ago someone brought a case against the government because of this.
*04:23.480- 04:27.600* :  The government apologized, offered some compensation, but a lot of people thought this wasn't
*04:27.600- 04:31.640* :  enough and they pursued more compensation through the courts.
*04:32.120- 04:37.600* :  The problem was there's a 20-year statute of limitations in Japan, so a lot of these cases
*04:37.600- 04:42.640* :  are just too old and so the Supreme Court, what it was doing was ruling on whether or
*04:42.680- 04:46.880* :  not these cases were too old or whether the plaintiffs could pursue them through the
*04:46.920- 04:47.400* :  courts.
*04:47.820- 04:52.080* :  And it's been quite a lengthy battle list and we're talking about people, some of them
*04:52.280- 04:54.440* :  who were just teenagers when they were sterilized.
*04:54.980- 05:00.360* :  The teenagers, some very, very terrible stories, one man I've just seen a report about
*05:00.360- 05:05.320* :  it, he was sent to a home for trouble children when he was 14, he had the sector, he was
*05:05.320- 05:10.360* :  forced to have a sector, he didn't tell his wife for decades and decades until she was
*05:10.360- 05:11.200* :  on her deathbed.
*05:11.780- 05:13.860* :  We have all those kinds of terrible stories.
*05:14.420- 05:19.720* :  What the court has ruled today is that these people can pursue their cases through the
*05:19.720- 05:21.460* :  courts, claim extra compensation.
*05:22.100- 05:26.480* :  This is something, by the way, the Japanese government tried to resist to stop them pursuing
*05:26.480- 05:31.240* :  their cases through the courts and so now it's probably assumed that a lot of cases in
*05:31.240- 05:36.260* :  the lower courts or cases people are waiting to start, will now start running through the
*05:36.260- 05:42.240* :  courts and people will be able to claim compensation and more importantly explain what went on
*05:42.240- 05:47.560* :  in their lives, what happened to them and how to seek address for these terrible, terrible
*05:47.600- 05:48.140* :  things.
*05:50.360- 05:55.300* :  Now to India and to the latest in a story you heard in our last podcast, survivors of
*05:55.300- 06:00.700* :  the country's deadliest ampeid in more than a decade have been describing how the religious
*06:00.700- 06:05.040* :  gathering they were attending turned into a scene of panic and then death.
*06:05.620- 06:10.280* :  More than 120 people are said to have been crushed to death at the prayer meeting in the
*06:10.280- 06:15.360* :  northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, nearly all the victims were women.
*06:16.120- 06:21.040* :  Those trying to save them questioned why the authorities hadn't done more to help.
*06:25.240- 06:28.360* :  Some were breathing, some were not, they were in a terrible condition.
*06:28.980- 06:33.360* :  We poured water on some who were breathing, made them drink water and wiped them out.
*06:33.360- 06:39.840* :  There was no rage for ambulances here, an ambulance came later, we stopped cars and transported
*06:39.840- 06:47.580* :  the patients to the hospital, where are the authorities, no official is present here.
*06:48.460- 06:53.060* :  Police say the marquee where the event was being held was massively overcrowded with a quarter
*06:53.060- 06:57.820* :  of a million people crammed into a venue which only had permission to host 80,000.
*06:57.840- 07:01.260* :  The police say they want to question the religious leader of the event.
*07:01.800- 07:05.960* :  Our South Asia regional editor, Ambrace and Reti Rajan, is at the scene of the disaster
*07:05.960- 07:07.180* :  in Uttar Pradesh.
*07:07.780- 07:15.840* :  Still we see dozens of people around this site, outside near the town of Hathras, and I
*07:15.840- 07:19.960* :  see people removing their tent, their marquee which they had put up.
*07:20.460- 07:25.560* :  And lot of policemen, forensic department people, they were all there this morning, political
*07:25.960- 07:28.340* :  leaders were visiting to find out what had happened.
*07:28.340- 07:35.180* :  There is a big art entrance with the photograph of the self-styled Godman.
*07:35.180- 07:40.820* :  It is still there, and it is raining, so the whole area has been flooded with water.
*07:40.820- 07:46.480* :  Now I am near the drain where most of these women died, what I see, people brought snacks
*07:46.480- 07:53.220* :  to eat during this meeting, prayer meeting, plastic cups, water cups, some clothes here,
*07:53.220- 07:58.200* :  and then also paper plates and slippers thrown around all over the place.
*07:58.220- 08:03.420* :  And this is the drain across the road where the majority of these people died.
*08:03.420- 08:09.080* :  Now police have launched an investigation, they are now want to question those who organized
*08:09.080- 08:09.740* :  this event.
*08:09.840- 08:14.060* :  There were tens of thousands of people, as you said, they were given permission only to
*08:14.060- 08:21.480* :  have 80,000, so how this was allowed to happen, and also find out whether there is any lapses
*08:21.520- 08:26.020* :  by the civil administration here, and these are the some of the areas the authorities want
*08:26.020- 08:26.540* :  to look at.
*08:27.980- 08:29.980* :  And what of survivors they have been saying to you?
*08:30.780- 08:36.200* :  I have been speaking to a couple of people who survived this event, and also one Hradesh Kumar,
*08:36.200- 08:41.420* :  he lost his wife, unfortunately, and what he said was women were all on the one side,
*08:41.420- 08:47.580* :  and the men were on the other side, and these young kids were sitting with the men, and
*08:47.580- 08:51.280* :  they did not, nothing happened to those kids, but then his wife unfortunately died.
*08:51.280- 08:57.200* :  He said, when the people are moving out, and they wanted to have a glimpse of this self-styled
*08:57.420- 09:02.440* :  Bole Baba, and they wanted to take the soil underneath the tire of his car, because
*09:02.440- 09:06.980* :  they are supposed to be a blessing, so every women were really coming across the road,
*09:07.540- 09:11.480* :  and that's when the whole thing happened fell into this drain around here.
*09:11.900- 09:16.140* :  So another person he was saying, you are still looking for his aunt, his aunt has been
*09:16.140- 09:20.380* :  missing since yesterday, and he went to four or five hospitals, could not find anybody,
*09:20.740- 09:22.100* :  or even on the injured list.
*09:22.600- 09:28.040* :  So the number of casualties is much, much higher than what officials are saying, because
*09:28.040- 09:33.360* :  many villagers told me here, just nearby, they said many did not want to go through the
*09:33.360- 09:38.940* :  process of post-mortem, say they took the bodies away, so we don't know the real casualty
*09:38.940- 09:42.080* :  figure, even though the official figure stands around 120.
*09:43.260- 09:44.580* :  Umbarassan at Eirajan.
*09:45.320- 09:49.480* :  As we recall this podcast, Israeli forces are continuing to battle Hamas and Islamic
*09:49.480- 09:54.700* :  Jihad fighters in a district of Gaza City, as tens of thousands of Palestinians further
*09:54.700- 10:01.060* :  south continue to try to find a safe location, after fleeing areas of Han Unis in response
*10:01.060- 10:04.100* :  to an Israeli evacuation order issued on Monday.
*10:04.780- 10:08.820* :  Explosions, shelling and gunfire have been heard throughout Gaza City.
*10:09.440- 10:13.220* :  The Israeli army says it's carrying out operation throughout the territory.
*10:13.960- 10:18.760* :  Meanwhile, Palestinians in southern Gaza continue their desperate search for somewhere to
*10:18.760- 10:19.180* :  shelter.
*10:19.280- 10:24.820* :  Louise Waterbridge is an official with the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees, Umbar.
*10:25.580- 10:31.300* :  In Nusariat where I am, which is somewhat by the coast, there are makeshift tents, makeshift
*10:31.300- 10:32.980* :  shelters, up to the waterline.
*10:33.280- 10:37.440* :  As the water is coming in from the sea, people are on the beach, families are on the beach,
*10:37.440- 10:39.040* :  they are shelter to shelter.
*10:39.440- 10:44.580* :  There is absolutely no space for people to move here, and from Karnunis, they're already
*10:44.580- 10:50.880* :  leaving these bombed-out and rubble-filled buildings that are very structurally unsafe.
*10:52.100- 10:56.440* :  Israel has designated the region of Al-Mawasi as a safe zone.
*10:56.680- 11:00.620* :  Marwan Isbatiya has moved from Karnunis with his family to Al-Mawasi.
*11:01.180- 11:02.940* :  He told the BBC about his journey.
*11:03.540- 11:08.480* :  We live in a rush, so we couldn't get all of our luggage and important things.
*11:08.900- 11:14.400* :  My cousin, who was being displaced two, three, four times, like me, has his own tent.
*11:14.400- 11:17.720* :  I was previously purchased one, and it was with me.
*11:17.860- 11:20.640* :  So I called a friend who resides in Al-Mawasi.
*11:20.640- 11:23.800* :  He told me, there is a place next to me who can come.
*11:24.200- 11:29.340* :  Then I went there to Al-Mawasi, it took from my location around three hours.
*11:29.800- 11:34.080* :  My wife is currently pregnant, and she could deliver maybe after one month.
*11:34.080- 11:40.720* :  We have to protect her very well, and she shouldn't be tired or exhausted.
*11:41.860- 11:47.880* :  But reports say an Israeli air strike killed 12 Palestinians in Al-Mawasi on Tuesday,
*11:47.880- 11:52.440* :  despite the fact that it has been designated as a safe zone by Israel.
*11:53.000- 11:55.960* :  Our Jerusalem correspondent, Yolanda Nell, Tobrasmoor.
*11:56.480- 12:01.940* :  These Palestinians have been fleeing from the east and part of Karnunis in droves,
*12:01.940- 12:03.520* :  continuing overnight.
*12:03.600- 12:08.160* :  They've described there's been an intense bombardment around Karnunis,
*12:08.560- 12:13.700* :  some of the heaviest fighting in that second biggest city in the Gaza Strip,
*12:14.060- 12:17.600* :  since Israeli troops withdrew there in early April.
*12:17.600- 12:21.200* :  There's one hospital source that said shelling killed at least eight people,
*12:21.680- 12:25.280* :  and people have been really heading west, some to other parts of Karnunis,
*12:25.660- 12:30.680* :  and many more to this area, which the Israeli military has declared a safe zone
*12:30.680- 12:33.200* :  along the coast, the Al-Mawasi area.
*12:33.200- 12:37.840* :  It's about 14 kilometers long, but of course, people are struggling to find space there.
*12:38.320- 12:43.980* :  The reason that Karnunis had become so crowded after it was largely left in ruins,
*12:43.980- 12:47.500* :  following that month's long Israeli military offensive there,
*12:48.040- 12:51.940* :  against what the Israeli military said was a stronghold of Hamas earlier in the war.
*12:52.320- 12:57.120* :  We had, since May, people fleeing from Raffa in the very south of the Gaza Strip,
*12:57.120- 13:02.120* :  that's where most of the displaced people in Gaza had ended up along the Egyptian border.
*13:02.120- 13:05.980* :  When Israel's military offensive started there, many people went to Karnunis,
*13:06.280- 13:11.200* :  some had already gone to Al-Mawasi, so that's why it's very difficult now for people to find
*13:11.860- 13:17.540* :  a place even to put up a makeshift tent in this area along the coast.
*13:17.700- 13:22.040* :  And we're hearing of just dire humanitarian conditions in this area,
*13:23.240- 13:26.420* :  lacking sanitation, lacking any kinds of medical facilities,
*13:26.480- 13:29.100* :  very, very limited access to aid.
*13:29.400- 13:31.080* :  Yes, given all that, how are people coping?
*13:31.080- 13:35.800* :  Because we're hearing reports that some of the tents are camped right down to the sea.
*13:35.800- 13:37.800* :  People are struggling to get food.
*13:37.840- 13:40.040* :  How are they disposing of their waste?
*13:40.200- 13:43.040* :  The war supplies there are often contaminated by sewage.
*13:43.040- 13:48.880* :  There are these mountains of rubbish because the local authorities really just overwhelmed by
*13:48.880- 13:54.260* :  the situation. I mean, the amount of food that has been entering into the southern part of the
*13:54.260- 13:59.500* :  Gaza Strip where most displaced Palestinians are has really dropped very dramatically since
*14:00.300- 14:01.560* :  the Raffa offensive began.
*14:01.580- 14:06.800* :  And the UN has been saying that the general lawlessness now in the south, which allows criminal
*14:06.800- 14:12.800* :  gangs to loot lorry loads of aid, it is making it extremely difficult to collect the aid from
*14:12.800- 14:17.620* :  the Karem Shalom crossing, which is the main one between Israel and Gaza, and then distribute it
*14:17.620- 14:19.980* :  to those people who are desperately in need.
*14:20.760- 14:21.380* :  You're land now.
*14:22.160- 14:26.720* :  Here in Britain, people are preparing to vote in what looks likely to be a historic election
*14:26.720- 14:32.780* :  on Thursday. One major concern is immigration, both illegal and legal.
*14:33.480- 14:38.640* :  Since the Conservatives came to power 14 years ago, total net migration, that's the difference
*14:38.640- 14:45.340* :  between those arriving in and leaving the country, has reached just under four and a half million
*14:45.680- 14:51.240* :  people. The two main parties, the Conservatives and Labour, say net migration is too high and should
*14:51.240- 14:56.980* :  be reduced, but they haven't given a figure. The anti-immigration populist reform party says it
*14:56.980- 15:01.180* :  should be reduced to zero. Our political correspondent Rob Watson reports.
*15:07.800- 15:12.140* :  This is the Alexander Carthome in Morley, just outside leads in the north of England.
*15:12.160- 15:15.120* :  And you would like some conference, can you hear me?
*15:15.740- 15:20.440* :  It's breakfast time. I'm with the Carthome's owner, Alex Morris. Now, the person
*15:20.440- 15:25.780* :  is having breakfast. I definitely detected it. A Yorkshire accent there, but many of your staff
*15:25.780- 15:28.720* :  are migrants. How vital are they to your business?
*15:29.400- 15:36.400* :  Oh, well, they're absolutely vital. 40% of our staff were born abroad, and it's not just
*15:36.400- 15:40.720* :  done on seats. They want to work, and they want to look after elderly people, and they want to
*15:40.720- 15:46.680* :  treat them with respect and incredibly vital to us. And what would happen to the social
*15:47.140- 15:51.460* :  care system in this country without pretty high levels of migration?
*15:52.260- 15:55.520* :  Well, I think not sound overly dramatic, but I think it would essentially collapse.
*15:57.200- 16:01.180* :  Of the nearly one and a half million visas, the government issued last year,
*16:01.600- 16:06.520* :  many were for people to work in places like this care home and other parts of the UK's health
*16:06.800- 16:12.340* :  system, while another significant chunk were for study, the higher fees paid by foreign students,
*16:12.340- 16:18.160* :  keeping down the costs for British-born pupils. But if the principal argument for immigration is
*16:18.160- 16:23.620* :  that Britain needs more people given its aging population, the arguments against it include
*16:23.620- 16:29.480* :  the strain higher numbers put on the country's already stretched public services. Here's the very
*16:29.480- 16:35.360* :  briefest of rebuttals from Paul Johnson of the Independent Think Tank, the Institute for Fiscal
*16:36.060- 16:40.900* :  Studies. On average, immigrants pay more tax than they use in terms of public services. They
*16:40.900- 16:44.960* :  younger than the average for the domestic population they use the health service less and so on.
*16:45.900- 16:51.360* :  The other argument against high levels of immigration is that it strains social cohesion and the
*16:51.360- 16:57.680* :  ability of an already diverse population to get along. An MP has died after being attacked in
*16:57.680- 17:02.480* :  the street and her constituency in West Yorkshire. Joe Cox was stabbed and shocked.
*17:02.520- 17:08.780* :  I am in backly a short distance from Leeds where in 2016 the sitting MP was murdered by a
*17:08.780- 17:14.960* :  right-wing English nationalist and where a teacher remains in hiding after showing a caricature
*17:14.960- 17:20.100* :  of the Prophet Muhammad. I was here in the hours after the MP's murder eight years ago
*17:20.100- 17:25.440* :  and have come back to talk to people about social cohesion and the extent to which the white
*17:25.440- 17:33.140* :  and Asian communities interact. Definitely people live separately to a degree. It's really
*17:33.140- 17:38.980* :  difficult to break down barriers and make changes because people are very much sitting
*17:38.980- 17:44.780* :  the ways and then they adopt out of the families of always being and I think it's just going to carry on
*17:44.780- 17:51.460* :  and carry on. I think they believe in when in Rome doers of the Romans do and that's not happening
*17:52.580- 17:58.120* :  here. They're going to this country and they're doing their own thing when a lot of it isn't
*17:58.120- 18:04.020* :  correct, it's not right. I'm just going to pop into a chai shop here on the main street to ask
*18:04.020- 18:09.000* :  the owner about what she makes of the charge from many white residents that communities live
*18:09.000- 18:16.240* :  separate lives. Not everyone is like that. I do agree that some of the people may do like this but
*18:16.620- 18:23.360* :  not everyone of us like this because we live in one community sharing everything with each other
*18:23.360- 18:29.020* :  and there should be no differences. It has been argued that along with stagnating living standards
*18:29.020- 18:35.640* :  concern over immigration and issues of identity and multiculturalism underlie much of Britain's
*18:35.640- 18:41.640* :  recent political turbulence. So any new government wanting stability will have to make sure that
*18:41.640- 18:45.940* :  not only are people better off but that they also get along better.
*18:47.460- 18:53.660* :  That report by Rob Watson. Now which sports championship allows you to sit while competing for
*18:53.660- 18:59.640* :  price money worth a cool 60 million dollars. It's the eSports World Cup which begins today.
*19:00.060- 19:04.620* :  Thousands of fans of gaming can watch their favourite players compete on classics such as
*19:04.620- 19:09.180* :  Call of Duty and League of Legends. The eight-week tournament is happening in Saudi Arabia,
*19:09.180- 19:13.200* :  a decision not without controversy given the accusations of sports washing.
*19:13.740- 19:17.660* :  Sophie McCarthy, editor-in-chief of eSports net, spoke to Imabarnit.
*19:17.880- 19:22.640* :  The eSports World Cup is going to be one of the biggest eSports tournaments of all time,
*19:22.640- 19:28.140* :  particularly in terms of price pool. It is an aggregate price pool of 60 million dollars that's
*19:28.140- 19:33.720* :  going to be split among 21 different games but it is the biggest prize pool that we've seen
*19:33.720- 19:38.840* :  in any eSports tournament in the last 10 years. Are they the players sitting down
*19:39.020- 19:43.420* :  and everyone else also watching sitting down? The whole sofa mentality comes to mind still
*19:43.420- 19:47.280* :  for a lot of people. How does it work? It's very much not like that anymore.
*19:48.860- 19:55.020* :  So these tournaments are played in enormous arenas, tens of thousands of people and it can be
*19:55.020- 20:01.480* :  equated very much to what one might call regular sports. People will be cheering. It's an incredible
*20:01.480- 20:06.580* :  atmosphere. It's very much not sitting on the sofa watching somebody play video games.
*20:06.700- 20:11.980* :  But are there other players standing? No, no. The players are by and large sitting down playing
*20:11.980- 20:17.160* :  at the computer on the stage with their teams. Are the concerns, because some do have them,
*20:17.160- 20:22.180* :  serious concerns, about the idea of sport washing, Saudi Arabia, a place where people feel
*20:22.540- 20:26.500* :  a regime feel very strongly that shouldn't be hosting these sorts of events and shouldn't be
*20:26.500- 20:31.380* :  funding them because of attitudes towards women, towards LGBT people. What do you make of that?
*20:31.860- 20:37.200* :  I think this is something that the esports industry does have to pay attention to and does have
*20:37.200- 20:41.980* :  to contend with. It's a very personal matter and I think that is something we need to take into
*20:42.780- 20:47.180* :  consideration. Sophie McCarthy, editor in chief of esports net.
*20:50.280- 20:54.840* :  Coming up on this podcast, how one of North America's largest areas of glaciers is melting
*20:54.840- 21:00.720* :  faster than previously thought. All the glaciers in the world contribute about quarter of global
*21:00.720- 21:06.260* :  sea level rise and Alaska is the biggest contributing place. These glaciers are really important in
*21:06.300- 21:07.360* :  driving sea level rise.
*21:15.320- 21:20.460* :  Gail Katz told friends she was leaving her husband Bob, then went missing. On season one of the
*21:20.460- 21:25.960* :  girlfriends, Bob's ex-girlfriends came together to bring him down and seek justice. I can't believe this.
*21:26.120- 21:31.600* :  Now on season two, host Carol Fisher is back working to solve the mystery of another missing woman.
*21:31.640- 21:36.560* :  It's almost like it's become this moral obligation to find her. Listen to the girlfriends
*21:36.560- 21:41.760* :  are lost sister. On America's number one podcast network, iHeart. Open your free iHeart app and
*21:41.760- 21:44.580* :  search the girlfriends are lost sister and start listening.
*21:50.980- 21:55.680* :  You're listening to the global news podcast. Let's turn now to the continuing conflict
*21:55.680- 22:02.380* :  in Sudan. The UN says humanitarian agencies there have faced looting on an industrial scale since
*22:02.380- 22:07.900* :  a civil war between the army and the paramilitary group the rapid support forces erupted more than a
*22:07.900- 22:15.040* :  year ago. The UN also says starvation is being used as a weapon of war in Sudan. It's been warning
*22:15.040- 22:22.380* :  of an imminent famine with 25 million people urgently needing humanitarian assistance. A senior
*22:22.380- 22:28.860* :  UN official, Toby Harvard told the BBC that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of aid had been lost.
*22:29.460- 22:35.440* :  Humanitarian partners have faced a looting on an epidemic on an industrial scale since the
*22:35.440- 22:42.640* :  beginning of the conflict in April 2023. I mean we have lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth
*22:42.640- 22:49.260* :  of humanitarian assistance, offices, vehicles, equipment, etc. from a number of different UN and
*22:49.260- 22:55.360* :  INGO bases across the country. But in this particular case, I understand what happened was an
*22:55.360- 23:02.560* :  unidentified gunman took advantage of a convoy that was heading in a particular part of central
*23:02.560- 23:10.260* :  .4 that is always difficult to control. Whoever are the authorities on the ground and it appears
*23:10.260- 23:16.780* :  that disaffected militias, criminals, bandits, etc. opportunistically were taking advantage
*23:17.420- 23:23.180* :  of the lack of rule of law, of the lack of general governance and stopped in this case three
*23:23.180- 23:30.680* :  food trucks and took a number of nutritional cartons, rice and sugar. Now obviously you know this has
*23:30.680- 23:36.240* :  an effect on what we do. We have to do everything we can to mitigate these risks but we will be
*23:36.240- 23:42.000* :  continuing. We have spoken with the de facto authorities on the ground and we have said very
*23:42.000- 23:48.100* :  clearly that we expect them to locate the gunman and return the looted food. We will continue
*23:48.100- 23:53.720* :  with the convoys that are going in in the hope that the vast majority will reach the intended
*23:53.720- 24:00.100* :  beneficiaries on the ground. UN official Toby Harford, as we record this podcast Hurricane
*24:00.100- 24:06.660* :  Barrel, a powerful category for storm, is barreling towards Jamaica after causing devastation
*24:06.660- 24:12.160* :  in smaller islands in the eastern Caribbean. Speaking to the BBC, the islands information minister
*24:12.160- 24:18.200* :  Senator Dana Morris Dixon said Jamaica was well prepared. We know we're going to be impacted
*24:18.820- 24:25.720* :  but we have a good government apparatus in order to respond to disasters were probably in the
*24:25.720- 24:31.220* :  best position we have ever been in in terms of being able to respond to a disaster and we have put
*24:31.220- 24:37.620* :  everything in place to deal with a hurricane of this strength and you know it's it's a big hurricane.
*24:38.720- 24:43.680* :  In St Vincent and the Grenadines, the majority of the population of Union Ireland is homeless.
*24:43.680- 24:49.160* :  Roads have been blocked and power cables are down. In Grenada on two of its three islands almost
*24:49.160- 24:53.280* :  all the homes and buildings have been destroyed as well as much of the islands vegetation.
*24:54.240- 24:59.340* :  Just before we recorded this podcast, Ben Rich from the BBC Weather Unit gave us this update.
*24:59.960- 25:06.140* :  The storm is now moving quite close to Jamaica, bearing down from the South East still has a
*25:06.140- 25:12.500* :  category four hurricane. So an extremely dangerous major hurricane. The winds now really picking
*25:12.500- 25:18.100* :  up across Jamaica. Tropical storm strength winds already setting in and those winds are only
*25:18.100- 25:24.520* :  set to increase. So hopefully people there have now made the preparations that they will need to
*25:24.520- 25:28.840* :  make because the conditions are only going to go downhill from here. What we're expecting
*25:28.840- 25:33.560* :  is for the eye to probably pass just to the south of Jamaica, so the centre of the hurricane
*25:33.560- 25:39.280* :  staying just the way to the south but close enough to bring really strong destructive winds,
*25:39.280- 25:46.340* :  sustained winds at the moment around 145 miles per hour, 230 kilometers per hour. That will
*25:46.340- 25:51.160* :  couple with that huge amounts of rain, perhaps 300 millimeters of rain, so that could give some
*25:51.160- 25:56.420* :  significant flooding and then on top of that a storm surge of two and a half meters which could
*25:56.420- 26:00.620* :  inundate low-line coastal areas, so really dangerous weather through the coming hours.
*26:01.320- 26:06.360* :  Really dangerous and unusual. Extremely unusual. This storm has it moved across the
*26:06.360- 26:12.500* :  Windward Islands a little bit further east, was the first category five hurricane ever recorded
*26:13.000- 26:19.060* :  in the Atlantic in June. The earliest category five hurricane we've seen. Now the storm still
*26:19.060- 26:23.680* :  powerful, not quite that powerful, but still really powerful as it moves its way westwards.
*26:23.780- 26:27.960* :  This time of year we tend to see the smaller hurricanes. The hurricane season runs from June
*26:28.400- 26:32.800* :  through to November. It peaks in September when sea temperatures are normally at their
*26:33.100- 26:37.900* :  highest, so that's when we tend to see the strongest storm. So this one very, very early in the
*26:37.900- 26:42.380* :  season. And briefly, do we know why? Well, the main reason is those sea surface temperatures,
*26:42.380- 26:48.160* :  the area of ocean that the storm has been moving across is around two or three degrees above average
*26:48.240- 26:52.260* :  and that's followed on from a pattern of very high sea temperatures right around the globe
*26:52.640- 26:56.760* :  over the last year actually. So that's probably the main reason. We've also come to the end of an
*26:56.760- 27:01.780* :  El Nino El Nino, which is a phenomenon in the Pacific actually, tends to suppress Atlantic
*27:01.780- 27:07.320* :  Hurricane activity. That has now eased, so that may well open the gate to bigger hurricanes like
*27:07.320- 27:12.520* :  these. We are expecting a really active Atlantic hurricane season this year. So it seems climate
*27:12.520- 27:16.860* :  changes. Well, climate change with warmer oceans and also what climate change will do when the
*27:16.860- 27:21.580* :  storms crop up, they are likely to be more powerful and bring a lot more rain. They may not be
*27:21.580- 27:25.520* :  more hurricanes because of climate change, but the ones we get are likely to be more intense.
*27:26.200- 27:32.580* :  BBC Weather Forecaster Ben Rich. Here in Britain, a woman has admitted giving her terminally ill
*27:32.580- 27:39.340* :  son a fatal dose of morphine more than 40 years ago. Antonio Cooper says her son Hamish, who was
*27:39.340- 27:45.580* :  seven at the time, was in great pain after months of gruelling cancer treatment. She says she's
*27:45.580- 27:51.100* :  decided to tell her story now in a bid to change the law on assisted dying, which is illegal
*27:51.100- 27:58.780* :  in the UK. Sophie Law reports. Hamish Cooper passed away at just seven years old. The year was
*27:58.780- 28:06.100* :  1981. He had neuroblastoma, a rare cancer that mostly affects children. Forty-three years on,
*28:06.100- 28:11.480* :  his mother Antonio has chosen to speak out about his death publicly for the first time,
*28:11.480- 28:19.060* :  prompted by her own diagnosis. I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. One of the scans that I was
*28:19.060- 28:26.100* :  having many of discovered I had secondaries in my liver. There is very much a limit on my life
*28:26.740- 28:33.180* :  going forward. We don't know how long. I wonder whether your experience with Hamish and everything
*28:33.180- 28:41.840* :  that happened there. Part of that has helped you be so proactive in terms of joining Dignitas,
*28:41.840- 28:48.840* :  being vocal about your support for assisted dying. Do you think that experience has...
*28:48.900- 28:54.060* :  Very much so, because on Hamish's last night, when he said he was in a lot of pain,
*28:55.540- 29:00.760* :  I said, would you like me to remove the pain? And he said, yes, please, Mama.
*29:03.460- 29:11.500* :  And through his Hickman catheter, I gave him a large dose of morphine that did quietly end his life.
*29:12.440- 29:17.780* :  At that point in our chat, we called it a day. It was an incredible revelation, a secret she'd kept
*29:17.780- 29:23.560* :  within the family for nearly four decades. I wanted to talk to Antonia about the parts she
*29:23.560- 29:28.720* :  played in her son's death in much greater detail, so we chose to come back a few weeks later.
*29:29.980- 29:38.280* :  He knew somewhere what was going to happen, but I cannot obviously tell you
*29:40.140- 29:52.020* :  why or how. I was his mother, he loved his mother, and I totally loved him, and I was not going to let
*29:52.020- 30:02.560* :  him suffer, and I feel he really do where he was going. There is theoretically a potential prison
*30:02.560- 30:12.520* :  sentence. There is. And if they come 43 years after I have allowed Hamish to die peacefully,
*30:14.380- 30:22.920* :  then I would have to face the consequences, but they would have to be quick, because I'm dying too.
*30:25.100- 30:28.100* :  Antonia Cooper ending their report by Sophie Law.
*30:29.780- 30:35.900* :  A U.S. federal judge has denied a request from prosecutors to stop rapper BG or Baby Gangsta,
*30:35.900- 30:41.680* :  who's known for the 1999 signature track, Bling Bling, from promoting future gun violence in
*30:41.680- 30:47.640* :  his music, citing free speech concerns. But he's been required to submit his lyrics for review to
*30:47.640- 30:53.860* :  ensure they align with his rehabilitation goals. BG, whose legal name is Christopher Dorsey,
*30:53.860- 31:00.480* :  was given a 14-year prison sentence back in 2012 after pleading guilty to illegally possessing a
*31:00.480- 31:07.420* :  gun during a 2009 traffic stop among other linked charges. In February this year, he began a two-year
*31:07.420- 31:12.640* :  period of living under federal supervision outside jail, which came under scrutiny from probation
*31:12.640- 31:18.260* :  officers after he performed at a concert in Las Vegas. For more on this, Victoria Uwon Kundas
*31:18.260- 31:22.820* :  Ramsey's jar, a hip-hop radio veteran who currently hosts a civic cipher,
*31:23.280- 31:26.900* :  build as the largest hip-hop radio show in America.
*31:27.860- 31:34.160* :  I recognize that the judge is playing the middle. The judge understands that there needs to be
*31:34.160- 31:41.000* :  a component of free speech, but the judge also recognizes that BG's lyrics and the lifestyle
*31:41.000- 31:46.780* :  that he's glorifying is inconsistent with the parameters of his parole. So she is not restricting
*31:46.780- 31:54.400* :  the free speech rather. She's suggesting that they be submitted for review so that the prosecution
*31:55.140- 32:02.620* :  can determine whether or not the lyrics are again consistent with the nature of his rehabilitation.
*32:03.320- 32:09.780* :  So what do you make of the fact that a BG now has to submit his lyrics or texts to his music
*32:09.780- 32:16.140* :  for review? He appreciates the fact that he is not been violated because he has
*32:16.940- 32:21.780* :  performed and recorded with artists that are also felons, which was one of the conditions of his
*32:21.780- 32:27.240* :  parole. So he's technically violated that, but he had to do that for work. I make of it personally
*32:27.240- 32:34.100* :  that he's making the best of a tough situation. He's like an actor. In fact, he equated himself to
*32:34.100- 32:41.700* :  Robert De Niro saying that Robert De Niro being forced to not play a mobster would really
*32:41.700- 32:46.420* :  compromise his ability to express himself his art and to make money for his family. So my heart
*32:46.420- 32:51.680* :  goes out to BG because this is the lifestyle he comes from. This is what he knows and this is what
*32:51.680- 32:56.880* :  he's known for wrapping about. I'm glad that he's not going back to jail for violating his parole,
*32:56.880- 33:03.960* :  but I'm also concerned that his speech is being monitored and that doesn't feel consistent with
*33:03.960- 33:09.720* :  the American way of life and nor the Constitution. Hip-hop veteran Rams is jar.
*33:11.660- 33:16.960* :  One of North America's largest areas of interconnected glaciers is melting twice as quickly as it
*33:16.960- 33:23.200* :  did before 2010. That's a worrying finding of a team of scientists. The Juno icefield sprawls
*33:23.200- 33:28.020* :  across the coastal mountains of Alaska and British Columbia, but new research published suggest
*33:28.020- 33:32.160* :  that not only is it melting twice as fast as it was less than a decade and a half ago,
*33:32.740- 33:36.740* :  but it's also melting five times faster than it was in the 1980s.
*33:37.300- 33:42.260* :  Bethan Davis is a senior lecturer of physical geography at Newcastle University and led this
*33:42.260- 33:48.680* :  research. We used quite a few different methods from the 1990s onwards. We used satellite imagery
*33:49.120- 33:56.680* :  and then from the 1940s and 1970s we used aerial photographs. These aerial photographs were flown
*33:56.680- 34:01.960* :  in the area in the time before we had GPS satellites and GPS technology, so there's no
*34:01.960- 34:07.560* :  due spatial information. They're just photographs. We had to stitch all of those photographs together
*34:07.560- 34:14.940* :  to make three-dimensional models of the icefield. Then we also looked at the imprint, the footprint
*34:14.940- 34:19.480* :  of the icefield at the little ice age, that period of time that was a little bit colder when
*34:19.480- 34:25.360* :  glaciers were a little bit bigger, and that was about 1770 in Alaska. The problem with icefields
*34:25.360- 34:30.960* :  like this is they are sustained by their own ice volume. They're not the small mountain glaciers
*34:31.040- 34:35.140* :  that we have in the European Alps that can just shrink back and then if it stops warming they can
*34:35.140- 34:42.400* :  stabilize. As the climate warms, this icefield will continue to lower and as it lowers into warmer
*34:42.400- 34:47.580* :  air and once it starts doing that it's really difficult to stop it. All the glaciers in the world
*34:47.580- 34:53.660* :  contribute about quarter of global sea level rise and Alaska is the biggest contributing place.
*34:54.120- 34:59.240* :  These glaciers are really important in driving sea level rise, certainly over the next 100 years.
*35:00.400- 35:01.860* :  Scientists, Beth and Davies.
*35:04.500- 35:08.620* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
