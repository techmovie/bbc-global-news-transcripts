*01:22.500- 01:27.720* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Oliver Conway and I'm
*01:27.720- 01:32.900* :  here to introduce you to our sibling podcast, The Global Story. Here's Lucy Hawking's.
*01:35.540- 01:40.820* :  We're taking a journey from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean across the West Bank and
*01:40.820- 01:46.740* :  Israel. It's a much contested stretch of land. What do the people living there,
*01:46.740- 01:55.140* :  Israeli or Palestinian want? I wish my kid could not go through the same hell that I've been through
*01:55.640- 02:00.240* :  and that's where the dream. As peace for the region hangs in the balance, we ask what hopes they have
*02:00.240- 02:08.860* :  for their future. With me today as BBC current affairs reporter Tim Hule, who has recently returned
*02:08.860- 02:13.960* :  from the region, where Tim, you've been interviewing lots of locals that we hardly ever hear from.
*02:13.960- 02:18.700* :  So good to have you with us. Hi, Lucy. Nice to be here. A very, very wide range of people,
*02:18.700- 02:22.940* :  certainly not just in terms of Palestinians and Israelis, but simply in terms of jobs, of backgrounds,
*02:23.100- 02:29.400* :  really, you know, a huge gamut of different people. So before we really delve into what drew you
*02:29.400- 02:34.520* :  to this area in the first place, why did you want to look into this? Well, I think partly,
*02:34.520- 02:39.920* :  obviously everybody's attention is even more closely focused now that the Gaza Wars on.
*02:40.000- 02:46.300* :  And I just got very interested in this slogan from the river to the sea. A lot of us didn't know
*02:46.300- 02:50.720* :  it before. Obviously, it's been shouted very loudly. You say it everywhere, no. You do really,
*02:50.720- 02:54.300* :  you really see it everywhere, because of course, I mean, obviously we've got to say at the beginning,
*02:54.300- 03:00.960* :  it's principally understood and used as a pro-Palestinian slogan, although we'll come into that in
*03:00.960- 03:06.880* :  more detail because it turns out it's used in some other contexts as well. But as you say,
*03:07.600- 03:12.920* :  used everywhere in protests against the war, but when surveys are done, of the people using it,
*03:12.920- 03:19.440* :  the people chanting it, a surprisingly high proportion don't actually know which river and which sea,
*03:19.440- 03:26.000* :  you know, asked which river, some say the Nile, some say the Euphrates, asked which sea, some say the
*03:26.000- 03:32.580* :  Dead Sea. So, you know, merely to emphasise, we're talking about the river Jordan, we're talking
*03:32.580- 03:39.900* :  about the Mediterranean, and what really interested me is how small the distances are. I just really
*03:39.900- 03:44.820* :  wanted to get, if you like, into the kind of physicality of this, you know, a river as sea,
*03:44.820- 03:52.480* :  they're very physical things, and between them is only 90 kilometres, like 50 odd miles.
*03:53.180- 03:57.280* :  And Tim, what is that 90 kilometres like between the river and the sea? What does it look like?
*03:57.280- 04:02.420* :  How does it feel? What does it sound like? Well, the first incredible thing to say is that
*04:02.860- 04:08.260* :  not only is it a very, very short distance, if you take the most direct line between the river
*04:08.260- 04:15.020* :  and the sea, but it goes right up and it goes right down again because talking about the river
*04:15.420- 04:19.880* :  Jordan, the Jordan Valley, it's part of the great Rift Valley. So, at the bottom end of the
*04:19.880- 04:25.620* :  Jordan, it's the lowest place on earth. So, you're talking 400 metres below sea level.
*04:26.560- 04:32.020* :  Within just a few miles, you're going up to 700 metres above, like dizzying the scents
*04:32.380- 04:38.380* :  in this really narrow strip, and then down again to the coast. And first of all, you're crossing
*04:38.380- 04:44.020* :  the West Bank, in other words, territory occupied by Israel, then you're crossing Israel, the coastal
*04:44.020- 04:50.680* :  strip of Israel before you get to the sea. And within that, everything is just so jumbled up.
*04:51.120- 04:55.980* :  So, you know, often people set out, of course, to get the Israeli perspective on something,
*04:55.980- 05:01.600* :  the Palestinian perspective on something. But if you actually make a journey, if you like,
*05:02.440- 05:08.140* :  go on a straight east-west line from the river to the sea, it's not like you have to like
*05:08.140- 05:14.840* :  achieve balance by setting out to visit these people or those people. Because on this line,
*05:14.840- 05:20.420* :  you will literally pass Palestinian village, followed by Israeli settlement, followed by Palestinian
*05:20.420- 05:25.960* :  village, like kind of, you know, different alternate beads in a necklace. And in terms of the
*05:25.960- 05:31.520* :  geography, I think when many people think of that area, they just in their minds, I see images
*05:31.520- 05:36.640* :  of conflict. But in terms of the geography, is it beautiful? It's incredibly beautiful, and it's
*05:36.640- 05:43.620* :  very overused word, of course, to say biblical. But actually, if you imagine, all these hills,
*05:43.620- 05:51.300* :  then, and obviously agriculture. We're protecting here an amazing variety of a
*05:51.300- 05:58.520* :  wide life, gazelles, wolves, boars, and hyenas, lots of songbirds. And because of the hills,
*05:58.520- 06:05.440* :  the agricultural has to be on terraces, dry stonewall terraces, so lots and lots of those have
*06:05.740- 06:10.860* :  olive trees on, for example. So most vigages and settlements, actually now,
*06:10.940- 06:16.100* :  crown hill tops, so in the case of Palestinian villages, probably there'll be a mosque
*06:16.560- 06:23.680* :  on the very crest of the hill. So yes, in many ways, it's a charming landscape, but ever,
*06:23.680- 06:28.820* :  ever more crowded. And of course, the physical crowding certainly Palestinians would argue,
*06:28.820- 06:33.400* :  in terms of the growth and growth of Israeli settlements, is if you're like part of a plan,
*06:33.400- 06:35.980* :  is a part of a plan, as they would see it like, to surround them.
*06:36.440- 06:41.980* :  Tim, you've already mentioned that it has been used in recent weeks and months by
*06:41.980- 06:47.300* :  pro-Palestinian activists, particularly around the world. But it's not only a phrase that's
*06:47.300- 06:51.920* :  important to them. What about the Israeli right wingers? What do they think of this phrase? How
*06:51.920- 06:58.920* :  do they use it? Well, that's right. So as used by Palestinians and pro-Palestinian people,
*06:59.360- 07:06.280* :  it means effectively, and certainly they would use this word, a return to the single state
*07:07.500- 07:13.100* :  that existed. Well, immediately before that, of course, it was a reduced mandate up to 1948
*07:13.100- 07:19.900* :  when Israel was created. So therefore, a single state between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean
*07:19.900- 07:26.940* :  Sea, which then we come into another big issue, whether that would then be shared by all the
*07:26.940- 07:31.560* :  existing people who are currently there, which is about 14 million people, if you take together
*07:31.560- 07:39.180* :  the West Bank, Gaza and Israel, Arabs and Israelis, Arabs and Jews, or whether you actually then
*07:39.180- 07:44.200* :  start saying when the thing obviously becomes even more controversial still, that some of the people
*07:44.200- 07:50.000* :  who've arrived since, which some Palestinians would simply mean Jews should leave. So even within
*07:50.000- 07:55.720* :  the issue of a single state, from a Palestinian perspective, there's that difference. But then,
*07:55.720- 08:02.280* :  as you say, on the other side, actually, there are Israelis, and I'm talking particularly in our
*08:02.280- 08:08.840* :  right-wing Israelis, who also believe that there should be one state Israeli sovereignty
*08:09.440- 08:14.200* :  all the way between the River and the Sea. So there is actually a huge amount of misunderstanding
*08:14.380- 08:20.300* :  about what the phrase actually means? Well, and this is where it really gets interesting,
*08:20.460- 08:26.300* :  because on this journey, I met a lot of people who were in favor of both on the Jewish side
*08:26.900- 08:32.660* :  and on the Palestinian side who said, yes, we want one state, and then I always asked the following
*08:32.660- 08:38.660* :  question, and what would that state be called? And so, of course, the Israeli say it would be called
*08:38.660- 08:43.800* :  the state of Israel, the Palestinian say it would be called Palestine, and then of course,
*08:43.800- 08:49.600* :  become straight back to the democracy. People on both sides, to be honest, some people,
*08:49.600- 08:54.780* :  are very frightened of the idea of a single state, because only one side of the other can be in
*08:54.780- 08:59.800* :  charge of that. Tim, how was the travel in terms of your logistics? Because it's not a very
*08:59.800- 09:06.360* :  large area, as you mentioned, but it's incredibly complicated, and I can only imagine how difficult
*09:06.360- 09:11.740* :  it must have been to sort out car journeys and handovers of cars and just how you actually did
*09:12.560- 09:18.420* :  this. Well, I have decided to really begin with, incredibly stupidly. I had this idea that I would
*09:18.420- 09:24.360* :  walk from the river to the sea, which again to come back to distances would only have taken me,
*09:24.360- 09:29.040* :  well, 50 odd miles, you know, I'm quite a good walker, I've got good boots, I actually could have
*09:29.040- 09:33.480* :  done it in three days, but stressful, but of course, you know, when I realised, you know, I was
*09:33.480- 09:37.900* :  being naive when I realised the security situation on the West Bank, people don't any longer,
*09:38.160- 09:44.220* :  it'll go walking, it just isn't safe. I would consider putting on personal protection gear,
*09:44.640- 09:51.380* :  but protest, yeah, just in case, because there's been a few terror incidents shooting at cars,
*09:51.380- 09:57.120* :  don't trying. By car, actually, you could do it in less than an hour and a half,
*09:57.460- 10:02.080* :  I took more than a week, because of course, I wanted to talk to people, I was exact a bit,
*10:02.500- 10:08.340* :  but as you say, the conception is very simple, logistically, it's incredibly complicated,
*10:08.340- 10:16.740* :  because the whole system of roads on the West Bank, for example, effectively, there are roads,
*10:16.740- 10:22.560* :  this isn't a formal thing, but in terms of who gets checked on roads, who doesn't get checked,
*10:22.560- 10:26.880* :  whether it's safe on particular roads, not safe on particular roads, you know, there are roads
*10:26.880- 10:31.620* :  where it's safer for Palestinians to be on, there are roads where it's safer and easier for
*10:32.280- 10:37.040* :  Israelis to be on, and you know, there's a huge question, what checkpoints can you go through,
*10:37.040- 10:41.800* :  even in kind of in which direction and so on, according, for example, to whether you're in an Israeli
*10:42.800- 10:49.760* :  licensed plate car or a Palestinian registered car, and equally, of course, Palestinians can't be in
*10:49.760- 10:54.180* :  Israeli settlements, Israelis can't easily be in Palestinian villages, so I had this
*10:54.900- 11:01.140* :  handover, this kind of swap system, at least once every day, so I had a series of Palestinian
*11:01.140- 11:08.040* :  guides, I had an Israeli guide, and at least once a day at a kind of agreed swap over point,
*11:08.040- 11:13.360* :  and it's quite difficult to find safe rendezvous locations as well, I mean, you can't just stop
*11:13.520- 11:18.020* :  by the side of any road, it just wouldn't be safe, but we worked all those out, and I was kind of
*11:18.020- 11:24.520* :  handed over, back and forth. Now we exit from the Jordan Valley, I'm moving on with Palestinian
*11:24.520- 11:30.240* :  Rashid Safate, the name of the checkpoint is Mali Fry, and so we just went through a checkpoint
*11:30.240- 11:36.220* :  just now. So yeah, that's all just the stop-ass, and we don't mention Domah, village where we are
*11:36.220- 11:42.580* :  going because there's a lot of activity in Domah, but I'm worried now, you know, I hope in my way
*11:42.580- 11:49.280* :  back, there would be no such thing. So I could, you know, go to Israeli places, subtle ones with
*11:49.660- 11:53.560* :  within Israeli, and go to Palestinian villages with a Palestinian. How did you make those
*11:53.560- 11:58.420* :  decisions, Tim, about where to start, where to go, to speak to? Well, it's complicated, and of
*11:58.420- 12:02.880* :  course, you know, the BBC has high-risk advisers, you know, people who know huge amount in detail
*12:02.880- 12:07.540* :  on the ground about the security situation, and of course I took a lot, a lot of local advice,
*12:07.540- 12:13.980* :  but you kind of think of the kind of places where normally, if you are in a normal place, you kind
*12:13.980- 12:18.380* :  of do things like that, you know, for example, in the very centre of the Northern West Bank,
*12:18.840- 12:21.800* :  you know, there's a crossroads, and right next to it, there's a petrol station,
*12:21.860- 12:26.040* :  at the hand of petrol station, there's a very good fast food restaurant, a hummus joint,
*12:26.100- 12:32.340* :  you'd think a great place for a handover, you know, but actually at that petrol station and hummus
*12:32.340- 12:38.560* :  place, six Israelis have been killed, you know, we sprayed with bullets in the last two years.
*12:39.240- 12:43.180* :  Well, in the end, we didn't hand over there, but we did stop there, in fact we had some hummus there,
*12:43.280- 12:47.520* :  but you know, you're living on the edge to some degree. You're not telling me this is the famous
*12:47.520- 12:55.860* :  hummus place where people got shot? Yes. Bad Omen. Yeah, this place was hit twice by Palestinian
*12:55.860- 13:02.880* :  gunmen, and the people going in I can see the religious settlers or as they call them national
*13:02.880- 13:08.840* :  religious. I mean, here at the BBC, we just take this so seriously that the idea of balance that
*13:08.880- 13:14.440* :  you wanted to hear from both communities. How did you make those decisions? Well, simply by going
*13:14.440- 13:19.220* :  in a straight line, the range of people you met to some degree, I'm defined itself, it actually
*13:19.220- 13:24.660* :  becomes because of everybody being so jumbled up, and I did end up going effectively to a
*13:24.660- 13:29.260* :  Palestinian place, followed by an Israeli settlement, and so on. But of course, I did to some degree
*13:29.260- 13:36.100* :  seek out stories. It's true. So that kind of took me a little bit off my route. So I was very
*13:36.100- 13:42.060* :  keen, for example, to spend a night, which was just an extraordinary experience with a Palestinian
*13:42.060- 13:48.140* :  shepherding community. And I just probably wanted to document, well, let's call them sheep wars,
*13:48.580- 13:53.200* :  which is really an extraordinary development on the West Bank over the last few years,
*13:53.760- 13:59.920* :  where Israeli settlers have gradually acquired more and more herds or flocks of animals,
*14:00.880- 14:05.920* :  and certainly from a Palestinian perspective, they're effectively trying, if you like,
*14:06.560- 14:13.600* :  to use those animals to establish more grazing rights, which if you like, then is to kind of
*14:13.600- 14:19.640* :  extend the territory of Israeli settlements, therefore kind of to extend Israeli control over
*14:19.640- 14:25.160* :  wider parts of the West Bank. So there was this collection of very, very rough tents, really
*14:25.560- 14:31.360* :  shelters, where about 12 Palestinian herding families live. And in fact, there was no trouble
*14:31.360- 14:36.520* :  the night we were there, but they said that quite often they get harassed in the middle of the
*14:36.560- 14:41.180* :  night by settlers. I mean, really extraordinary things where settlers come down with tractors,
*14:41.180- 14:45.900* :  they suddenly announce they're going to plant something, plow the land in the middle of the night,
*14:45.900- 14:50.380* :  but all these obviously are accompanied by threats, and these are forms of harassment.
*14:51.820- 14:56.540* :  The first thing like one night settlers came with the goats and his sheep,
*14:57.660- 15:02.380* :  even later they was coming with the Israeli military, the soldiers they asked him to leave,
*15:02.380- 15:11.520* :  they are not allowed to be there. They come on time to try to grow the wheat, to plow the land,
*15:11.520- 15:16.100* :  yeah. And Abu Khairi, he just slipped, you know, in the front of the tractor.
*15:16.340- 15:19.540* :  You lay down in front of the tractor, weren't you scared?
*15:29.160- 15:33.780* :  On the other side, you know, what the settlers would say is we've got to really stress,
*15:33.780- 15:38.660* :  we are talking about occupied land that is generally regarded, you know, by the international
*15:38.660- 15:44.720* :  community believes that the settlements are against international law, but talking now
*15:44.720- 15:50.460* :  from the settlers perspective, they say that many of these Palestinian encampments, if you like,
*15:50.460- 15:56.880* :  shepherding encampments, have no right to be there, and all this goes back to Oslo Accords
*15:57.400- 16:02.600* :  in the mid-90s. They were obviously at the time a legal agreement between Israel and the
*16:02.600- 16:07.740* :  Palestinian leadership, which was agreed by both sides. So we've looked at the meanings behind
*16:07.780- 16:12.640* :  the much repeated phrase from the River to the Sea, we've learned more about what the area is
*16:12.640- 16:17.660* :  like. Next, I want to look at the spectrum of opinions that Tim heard from those living there,
*16:18.060- 16:20.820* :  and whether they believe a peaceful future is possible.
*16:24.560- 16:29.240* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*16:29.480- 16:34.440* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising
*16:34.440- 16:39.620* :  their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*16:39.920- 16:44.920* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*16:45.340- 16:47.900* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com-switch.
*16:54.800- 16:58.480* :  This is an ad by BetterHelp. How often do you compare yourself to others?
*16:58.480- 17:03.740* :  It's easy to envy friends' lives on social media, but comparison is the thief of joy,

*17:38.760- 17:41.280* :  With me, as BBC Current Affairs reported Tim Pugh,
*17:41.640- 17:47.540* :  Tim, you're travelling from the river to the sea after October 7th, obviously,
*17:47.540- 17:52.920* :  with the conflict still raging in Gaza. What did people tell you about
*17:52.940- 17:58.520* :  how they were feeling, whether they'd been able to, in any way, move on from that day?
*17:59.280- 18:03.100* :  You're absolutely right, and October 7th dominates everything.
*18:03.100- 18:10.400* :  Obviously, I didn't go through Gaza. Gaza is kind of south, if you like, of my route,
*18:10.400- 18:15.400* :  because it is actually south of where the river Jordan finally ends in the Dead Sea.
*18:15.660- 18:20.900* :  But yes, everybody is in the shadow of October 7th, but I think the first thing we should say is,
*18:20.900- 18:27.380* :  though, that everybody talks of October 7th. Everyone uses that phrase, but even by it,
*18:27.760- 18:32.620* :  people mean different things. So when Israelis say October 7th,
*18:33.400- 18:43.160* :  they mean simply the horror of that day, that Saturday, last October, when Hamas and other Palestinian
*18:43.160- 18:50.920* :  armed groups burst into Israel, 1200 Israelis were killed, and they're still really focused
*18:51.760- 18:58.300* :  really on the horrors of that day. When Palestinians say October 7th, they're basically using it
*18:58.580- 19:05.380* :  as a shorthand for everything that started after that day. Therefore, they're principally,
*19:05.720- 19:11.380* :  to be honest, talking about the Gaza War and all the suffering and deaths that have been in Gaza
*19:11.800- 19:17.940* :  since then. And actually, the events of October 7th themselves as a day, it seemed to me very,
*19:17.940- 19:27.340* :  very much that a lot of Palestinians downplay that. And to them, it's just one more date in a
*19:27.820- 19:35.420* :  really long sequence of dates going back over decades. And to Israelis by contrast, it's something
*19:35.420- 19:41.880* :  totally, totally different. And we know, of course, that Israelis basically, this has been said a lot
*19:41.880- 19:46.880* :  on how, how is Israelis frame it? They're the largest single loss of Jewish life since the horror
*19:46.880- 19:54.740* :  cost. Israel is reliving October 7th every single day through the media, which goes back to October 7th
*19:54.780- 20:00.380* :  every single day. You are constantly exposed to what happened on October 7th from a million different
*20:00.380- 20:06.500* :  vantage points. We're still there. I mean, I've spoken to Israelis who say they still wake up every
*20:06.500- 20:11.180* :  morning and it is the first thing that they think of. They cannot move on from that day.
*20:11.540- 20:16.000* :  Well, that's absolutely right. And the second half of my journey, I left the West Bank and was
*20:16.000- 20:22.720* :  across Israel and person after person said to me exactly that. We haven't moved on. We simply
*20:22.720- 20:27.700* :  can't move on. This was so overwhelming. You know, so many people were touched. Israel's a small
*20:27.700- 20:34.480* :  country, almost everybody knows somebody who was killed directly or indirectly, not many degrees
*20:34.480- 20:40.960* :  of separation, someone who was taken hostage. It's extraordinarily close to everyone. And I think
*20:40.960- 20:46.720* :  one of the most really fascinating meetings that I had, this was somebody I particularly sought out
*20:46.720- 20:52.580* :  or two people actually, their teachers, husband and wife teachers. I wanted to meet them because
*20:52.940- 20:58.420* :  there's a very unusual subject that's taught in Israeli schools, which in Hebrew is called
*20:58.960- 21:07.840* :  Shoah, which is short for field, nation and society. And it's about kind of the idea is if you know
*21:07.840- 21:12.960* :  your country, physically know your country, if you like, there's a lot of walking involved. You take
*21:12.960- 21:20.720* :  responsibility for your country and it's subject about teaching values. So this teacher himself had been
*21:20.720- 21:28.580* :  in Gaza as a reservist and he came back, got a hero's welcome at his school. Then of course
*21:28.580- 21:36.080* :  started teaching his students about values as he believed. He had shown, you know, with Israel
*21:36.080- 21:41.820* :  defense forces in Gaza. So he talked, for example, he met hardly any civilians because they'd all been
*21:41.820- 21:46.280* :  evacuated to places they were told were safe. So in terms of actual meeting powers, he was basically
*21:46.280- 21:50.880* :  clearing houses. He hardly met any, any Palestinians actually. And the two he did meet were both
*21:51.320- 21:57.700* :  disabled people who hadn't been able to flee and he described how he'd really tried to help them
*21:58.300- 22:04.400* :  in a human way. And that was quite a moving story. But you know, I said to him, as I think anybody
*22:04.400- 22:09.780* :  coming from outside Israel would say, but you know, hang on a minute, you're teaching values
*22:10.460- 22:15.380* :  or discussing values in school to students around the subject of the Gaza war.
*22:16.100- 22:21.660* :  You must mention at some point it must arise the subject of how many children, thousands of
*22:21.660- 22:27.840* :  children, have been killed in Gaza. I think the situation in the beginning of the world was we
*22:27.840- 22:35.240* :  were afraid. There wasn't any one family around me that didn't know anyone that killed or
*22:35.240- 22:41.680* :  kidnapped or murdered. We're talking about values and so on. I mean, in the outside world,
*22:41.920- 22:47.000* :  people are saying thousands of children have died in Gaza. And I'm just interested in whether
*22:47.000- 22:54.220* :  that's being talked about, for example, in the lessons that you have. I think it's too early.
*22:55.040- 23:01.820* :  It's too early. We're still wounded. We're still trying to understand what happened there in
*23:01.820- 23:08.220* :  the 7th of October. We have lots of people that's not in their houses anymore. We have people
*23:08.220- 23:17.640* :  in Gaza to test it. I think that Israel is still thinking about herself. So if you're asking
*23:17.640- 23:24.840* :  us to now be on the other side, I'm not, I'm not sure where, like I think it's too early.
*23:25.980- 23:32.400* :  When you say that the degrees of separation are small in Israel, we are now talking about almost
*23:32.400- 23:39.320* :  40,000 people killed, Palestinians killed, 90,000 wounded. So the same could be said. I suppose you
*23:39.320- 23:44.760* :  had those conversations to everyone knows someone or knows a family who has been affected in Gaza
*23:44.760- 23:49.460* :  by this from the Palestinian side. No, I mean, that's, of course, of course, that's true. I mean,
*23:49.760- 23:53.400* :  obviously the West Bank and Gaza, they're very close to one another. They're not, they're not
*23:53.400- 23:58.800* :  physically linked. Some people in the West Bank, of course, yes, absolutely have relatives in
*23:58.820- 24:04.320* :  Gaza, some don't. But I think as Palestinians, certainly, I think they obviously they all share
*24:04.500- 24:10.320* :  that pain. And you know, also, I think it's really important to say that on either side,
*24:10.820- 24:15.160* :  what people are seeing, particularly what people are seeing on television screens, what people
*24:15.160- 24:22.000* :  are seeing on social media is completely different. So did people talk to you about the future?
*24:22.560- 24:28.080* :  Or did it feel that everyone is so stuck in this moment, this experience that they couldn't
*24:28.080- 24:34.140* :  look ahead? I think, you know, my overwhelming feeling is, October the 7th on both sides
*24:34.880- 24:43.140* :  has reinforced people very strongly in the attitudes they already had. And, you know, I also think
*24:43.140- 24:49.800* :  that, you know, if we talk now more about Israel, you know, that among liberal Israelis, people
*24:49.800- 24:55.160* :  very much who did believe in the future in a two-state solution, believed in the creation of a
*24:55.160- 25:01.500* :  Palestinian state to be alongside Israel, I think some of them no longer do. There is a phrase
*25:01.500- 25:09.760* :  that some people use in Israel, which roughly translates as sobering up, meaning that some people
*25:09.760- 25:16.200* :  have those kind of good broad views since October the 7th, no longer have them. It's interesting
*25:16.200- 25:22.120* :  because when you listen to foreign diplomats or heads of state, firstly, they talk about a cease
*25:22.160- 25:26.980* :  fire and then they will also talk about a two-state solution. But we saw the Knesset overwhelmingly
*25:26.980- 25:33.580* :  passing this motion, rejecting the two-state solution. Do you hear ordinary people talk about it?
*25:33.820- 25:38.680* :  On your journey, was anyone mentioning that? I mean, the feeling about the future is what?
*25:39.280- 25:44.600* :  My feeling was, you know, even before this Knesset vote, you know, this vote in Israel's parliament,
*25:44.900- 25:50.320* :  my feeling was, a two-state solution, if you like, is still the preferred solution
*25:51.000- 25:56.580* :  with acceptance, but put it together of the international community. It's what most diplomatic
*25:56.580- 26:01.880* :  efforts, you know, for decades already have been focused on. You know, on the ground,
*26:01.980- 26:07.600* :  it does seem to me that fewer and fewer people on either side believe in it.
*26:07.780- 26:12.100* :  So Tim, as you traveled from the river to the sea and spoke to so many different people from
*26:12.100- 26:20.500* :  different generations, did any kind of unifying theme emerge at all? Well, you know, it isn't easy
*26:20.500- 26:29.540* :  to see hope in this. It's easy now to see how polarization will increase, but I think in a way,
*26:29.540- 26:38.160* :  the only ray of hope that you can see is just that the extremity of the situation now will concentrate
*26:38.160- 26:45.040* :  minds. And while some people, as I say, you know, on the Israeli side, certainly obviously,
*26:45.040- 26:49.860* :  this comes down to whether you have means or not, you know, said to me, we do not want to bring
*26:49.860- 26:55.920* :  up our children in this situation. We are simply going to leave the country. You know, there were
*26:55.920- 27:03.460* :  others who said, this proves all the more we have to find a solution. And the young people on the
*27:03.460- 27:10.720* :  beach, including one who had been in Gaza, obviously fighting for Israeli forces, had been wounded,
*27:10.720- 27:17.780* :  himself quite badly wounded. And he said, my grandfather fought in Israel's wars, my father fought,
*27:17.780- 27:24.380* :  I've ended up fighting. I am absolutely determined. You know, he said, I'm staying here, I'm not leaving,
*27:24.380- 27:29.600* :  but I'm absolutely determined, you know, he's still young, doesn't have a family yet, but when I
*27:29.600- 27:35.740* :  have a family, that my child will not fight. Truly, it annoys me, really. The reason
*27:35.900- 27:41.700* :  humans are better than every other animal is because we learn from generation to generation.
*27:42.040- 27:47.760* :  My grandfather came from Yemen. From Yemen? He didn't know what the tab was. No running water.
*27:47.940- 27:54.420* :  Yeah, and now I'm here with my iPhone, with the Siri, with the smartphone, with everything,
*27:54.460- 28:00.200* :  basically, and I'm still fighting the same war on the same land. And it's annoying. And I wish
*28:00.200- 28:07.940* :  my kid could not go through the same hell that I've been through. And that's where the dream.
*28:08.960- 28:14.660* :  And I think that kind of determination, which must in the NBA determination to find a solution,
*28:14.820- 28:18.800* :  I think that's one of the maybe few rays of hope that you can see.
*28:19.420- 28:21.120* :  Tim, thank you. Thank you, Lucy.

*28:52.600- 28:59.100* :  He was a kind of vigilante killer. He killed at least 19 people during the 1980s in South Africa.
*28:59.440- 29:04.840* :  Very dark time. People were desperate. We were looking for him. We couldn't find him.
*29:05.120- 29:09.840* :  And nobody knew where he was. Every single one of his victims was black.
*29:10.680- 29:13.480* :  He reached such a stage where he was now hunting.
