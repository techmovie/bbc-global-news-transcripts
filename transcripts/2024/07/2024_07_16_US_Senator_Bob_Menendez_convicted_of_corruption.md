*01:25.240- 01:26.440* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:26.440- 01:30.060* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Wednesday, the 17th of July.
*01:30.140- 01:34.380* :  Gold bars and banknotes, US Democratic Senator Bob Menendez,
*01:34.380- 01:37.500* :  is found guilty of corruption and acting as a foreign agent.
*01:38.280- 01:41.960* :  Police in Bangladesh have raided the headquarters of the main opposition party
*01:42.320- 01:44.420* :  after another day of violent protests.
*01:45.580- 01:48.660* :  And the German government bans a right-wing extremist magazine,
*01:48.660- 01:50.700* :  accusing it of whipping up hatred.
*01:51.180- 01:52.840* :  They've published logos, for example,
*01:52.860- 01:57.020* :  that said, in Basel from Africa and with black people on the cover,
*01:57.640- 02:01.960* :  they have also published things talking about how the elites are planning the end of times.
*02:04.660- 02:09.340* :  Also in the podcast, health officials in Gaza say more than 50 Palestinians have been killed
*02:09.340- 02:14.400* :  in Israeli strides, as Prime Minister Netanyahu vows to increase pressure on Hamas.
*02:15.120- 02:17.400* :  And the American rock duo, Tanesha's D,
*02:17.400- 02:22.800* :  cancelled the rest of their world tour after an onstage joke about the Donald Trump.
*02:23.000- 02:23.360* :  Shooting.
*02:27.980- 02:32.700* :  But we begin in the United States, and it is not a good look for the Democrats.
*02:32.700- 02:36.500* :  One of their most influential senators, Bob Menendez,
*02:36.920- 02:42.640* :  has been found guilty of corruption after gold bars and large amounts of cash were found at his home.
*02:42.700- 02:47.440* :  The 70-year-old senator for New Jersey was convicted on all 16 counts,
*02:48.020- 02:51.720* :  including bribery, acting as a foreign agent and obstructing justice.
*02:51.820- 02:57.660* :  U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said Mr. Menendez had put his position as an influential
*02:57.660- 03:02.780* :  senator up for sale. This case has always been about shocking levels of corruption,
*03:02.780- 03:09.240* :  hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in the form of cash, gold bars, and Mercedes-Benz.
*03:09.240- 03:14.400* :  This wasn't politics as usual, this was politics for profit, and now that a jury has convicted
*03:14.400- 03:19.500* :  Bob Menendez, his years of selling his office to the highest bidder have finally come to an end.
*03:19.920- 03:22.840* :  But Senator Menendez said he would fight to clear his name.
*03:23.280- 03:26.880* :  Obviously, I'm deeply, deeply disappointed by the jury's decision.
*03:27.460- 03:31.980* :  I have every faith that the law and the fact that not sustain that decision,
*03:32.480- 03:35.240* :  and that we will be successful upon appeal.
*03:35.920- 03:38.120* :  I have never violated my public oath.
*03:38.500- 03:42.740* :  I have never been anything but a patriot of my country and for my country.
*03:42.880- 03:48.400* :  I have never, ever been a foreign agent, and the decision registered by the jury today
*03:48.460- 03:54.600* :  would put at risk every member of the United States Senate in terms of what they think a foreign
*03:54.600- 03:55.460* :  agent would be.
*03:56.020- 04:00.820* :  However, the most senior Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer has called on him to resign.
*04:00.820- 04:03.220* :  I heard more from Ioni Wells in Washington.
*04:04.020- 04:08.300* :  This case really centered around accusations that he accepted bribes,
*04:08.300- 04:13.680* :  including gold bars, cash, even a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for helping foreign governments.
*04:14.240- 04:19.660* :  His defense had really centered around his argument that these weren't bribes.
*04:19.660- 04:24.220* :  They were just gifts and that no specific action was taken as a result of receiving them.
*04:24.320- 04:26.640* :  But a guilty verdict has now been found.
*04:26.640- 04:32.720* :  The prosecution have said that he was guilty of 16 counts of this bribery scheme.
*04:32.720- 04:37.940* :  His lawyers had also tried to shift the blame a little bit during the trial to his wife.
*04:37.940- 04:42.360* :  Mrs. Menendez portraying her as what they described as financially troubled.
*04:42.380- 04:45.940* :  Somebody who hoped to get cash and assets anyway she could.
*04:46.300- 04:49.880* :  She is also facing charges as part of this wider case,
*04:49.880- 04:53.140* :  although her trial was delayed due to her receiving cancer treatment.
*04:53.500- 04:55.940* :  Yeah, I mean, will he end up in jail?
*04:55.940- 04:58.540* :  And if so, can he then continue as a senator?
*04:59.140- 05:03.480* :  Well, certainly he now faces the prospect of potentially decades in prison,
*05:03.480- 05:06.440* :  possible expulsion from the Democratic Party as well.
*05:06.440- 05:11.580* :  He is still at the moment hoping to run as an independent and keep his seat
*05:11.580- 05:17.020* :  in New Jersey at November's US election after most Democrats in the state walked away from him
*05:17.020- 05:22.120* :  when the indictment showed those gold bars stashed in his home last year.
*05:22.460- 05:26.540* :  Now, since the verdict, though, multiple senators have issued statements
*05:26.540- 05:32.060* :  calling on him to resign saying that he shouldn't be standing again now that he's been found guilty on all counts,
*05:32.060- 05:34.260* :  including, for example, Senator Murray.
*05:34.260- 05:38.960* :  We've just had a statement through saying they strongly reiterate their call for him to step down.
*05:38.960- 05:40.920* :  No one is above the law.
*05:40.920- 05:45.680* :  So I think he's certainly facing kind of cool because now of people asking him to resign completely.
*05:46.020- 05:48.560* :  Yes, you say the election less than four months away.
*05:48.560- 05:53.220* :  What will be the impact of this on Democrats in their chances in various races?
*05:53.760- 05:58.200* :  Well, I think certainly part of the motivation behind a lot of other Democratic senators
*05:58.200- 06:02.780* :  and politicians coming out asking him to resign is to try and distance themselves from him.
*06:03.000- 06:07.040* :  There is certainly a concern about sort of reputational damage as a result of this verdict.
*06:07.040- 06:08.260* :  It's been a long trial.
*06:08.260- 06:09.540* :  It's been very high profile.
*06:09.540- 06:13.500* :  And certainly that sort of negative publicity is not what the party needs right now,
*06:13.500- 06:17.400* :  as it is gearing up for its own convention in August in Chicago,
*06:18.340- 06:22.980* :  especially given that the party has already been battling negative headlines over the last couple of weeks
*06:22.980- 06:27.500* :  because of President Biden's performance in the presidential debate and serious concerns
*06:27.500- 06:30.920* :  at the high ends of the Democratic party about his fitness for office.
*06:31.300- 06:32.720* :  I only was in Washington.
*06:33.520- 06:35.560* :  Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance,
*06:35.560- 06:40.680* :  says the former US President told him he was chosen because he could help win key battleground
*06:40.680- 06:47.540* :  states and help him govern. The Ohio Senator has also addressed his past criticism of his new boss,
*06:47.920- 06:49.460* :  saying his views have changed.
*06:49.460- 06:54.600* :  The vice presidential nominee has also prompted reaction abroad after branding China the
*06:54.600- 07:00.260* :  biggest threat to America and calling the UK the, quote, first, truly Islamist country with a
*07:00.260- 07:04.860* :  nuclear weapon. James Nocti has met JD Vance and sent us this profile.
*07:05.820- 07:11.080* :  It makes no difference to Donald Trump that he's now running mate once called him America's Hitler.
*07:11.840- 07:15.960* :  In Trump world, memories hardly matter. It's the here and now, always.
*07:16.400- 07:20.900* :  And JD Vance today brings vigor to the ticket, the loyalty of a convert,
*07:20.900- 07:26.600* :  and the voice of the angry America where the former president gets all his political energy.
*07:30.320- 07:32.700* :  What a night. I love you guys too. Wow.
*07:33.280- 07:38.540* :  I met him at the end of last year in the company of Steve Bannon, hero of what he calls the
*07:38.540- 07:42.920* :  Christian nationalism movement, who's currently in jail for contempt of Congress.
*07:43.360- 07:49.260* :  And I watched a loving on Bannon's twice daily Trump supporting radio show The War Room,
*07:49.740- 07:56.100* :  reaching millions and broadcasting for nearly 24 hours each week from a bookstuff study in Bannon's
*07:56.100- 07:57.400* :  home on Capitol Hill.
*07:58.080- 07:59.920* :  We're honored to have Senator JD Vance.
*08:00.360- 08:04.040* :  The reason we've asked Senator Vance been so gracious to actually come into the studio.
*08:04.520- 08:07.840* :  On that particular morning, they shared their on air contempt.
*08:07.840- 08:11.660* :  It is the only appropriate word for Vladimir Zelensky.
*08:12.180- 08:16.820* :  And outside, I spoke to Senator Vance for the Radio 4 documentary America on the edge
*08:17.100- 08:21.020* :  and wondered why he wanted Vladimir Putin to win in Ukraine.
*08:21.100- 08:24.900* :  If he takes 20% of Ukrainian territory, is that a victory for him?
*08:24.900- 08:28.820* :  I think probably yes, but if you still preserve Ukrainian independence,
*08:28.860- 08:31.220* :  that's probably something that we can deal with.
*08:31.740- 08:36.380* :  Looking out to the world, he's relaxed about authoritarian Victor Orban and Hungary,
*08:36.740- 08:42.700* :  is by far his favorite European. He professes to share Trump's view that NATO is obsolete.
*08:43.520- 08:46.740* :  And as far as Britain is concerned, he sees decline.
*08:46.740- 08:51.920* :  What is the first truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon?
*08:51.920- 08:55.840* :  And we were like, maybe it's Iran, maybe Pakistan already kind of counts.
*08:55.840- 08:58.120* :  And then we sort of finally decided, maybe it's actually the UK,
*08:58.120- 09:00.300* :  since Labour just took over.
*09:00.980- 09:03.060* :  Declined is his stock in trade.
*09:03.540- 09:09.520* :  His 2016 book Hillbilly Elegy, a powerful and eloquent story of his life as a child
*09:09.520- 09:14.820* :  of the so-called Rust Belt, expressed the sentiments that put much more crudely
*09:15.320- 09:17.960* :  one from the White House, angered about immigration,
*09:17.960- 09:22.400* :  a world trading system that seemed to suck jobs away from the Midwest,
*09:22.980- 09:25.580* :  and a distant elite that just didn't understand.
*09:26.600- 09:31.000* :  He is a Yale educated success story, who made millions in Silicon Valley,
*09:31.280- 09:36.520* :  where the multi-billionaire and dedicated libertarian Peter Teal is his patron.
*09:37.020- 09:41.820* :  The American people again, they need people who put the interests of their own citizens first,
*09:41.820- 09:45.640* :  of our own citizens first, and that's what this entire movement is all about.
*09:46.240- 09:47.700* :  ambitious and clever.
*09:48.280- 09:52.800* :  And those who know him well don't accuse him of being in an ideological straight jacket.
*09:53.360- 09:55.880* :  He's changed before and could do so again.
*09:56.640- 10:02.440* :  It may be, for example, that some of his arguments in the Senate on abortion and even contraception
*10:02.880- 10:05.020* :  will be toned down in this campaign.
*10:05.020- 10:07.420* :  His bigger interest is power.
*10:08.040- 10:11.740* :  What are Republicans running on, delivering the peace and prosperity to Donald Trump,
*10:11.740- 10:13.180* :  already delivered in his four years?
*10:13.480- 10:18.160* :  What are Democrats running on, lies, and complete distortions of people's records?
*10:18.900- 10:24.900* :  James David Vance, age 39 of Middletown, Ohio, that could be no more appropriate hometown,
*10:25.100- 10:29.220* :  has been picked to galvanize the states where this election may be decided,
*10:30.080- 10:35.020* :  Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and he's got the right equipment, a feeling for the territory,
*10:35.780- 10:38.320* :  eloquence, youth, and ruthlessness.
*10:39.040- 10:43.660* :  The Office of Vice-President has propelled six people since 1945 to the Oval Office,
*10:44.040- 10:50.180* :  not a bad precedent for young Senator Vance, serving a candidate who will enter his 80-of-year next
*10:50.180- 10:57.420* :  summer in the White House if he wins in November. Other VPs have served the time and slipped into
*10:57.420- 11:04.440* :  obscurity. If the Republican ticket does win, you can bet that JD Vance is unlikely to be one of those.
*11:05.180- 11:11.460* :  Barraport by James Nochti. Bangladesh has seen another day of angry protests, as tens of
*11:11.500- 11:14.300* :  thousands of students took to the streets over a lack of jobs.
*11:21.420- 11:25.980* :  If I don't get a job after completing my studies, after six years of study,
*11:26.380- 11:29.520* :  will the government take responsibility for the hardship I'm going through?
*11:29.980- 11:31.200* :  My family's going through?
*11:31.640- 11:36.960* :  Footage show demonstrators brandishing wooden poles, police fired rubber bullets and tear gas,
*11:37.520- 11:41.820* :  and the protesters were also attacked by rival students from the youth wing of the governing
*11:41.820- 11:46.560* :  Awami League. Following the unrest, the government ordered all schools and colleges to shut,
*11:46.560- 11:50.360* :  and there was a late-night raid on the headquarters of the main opposition party.
*11:51.060- 11:55.480* :  More than 30 million young Bangladeshis are out of work and not in education,
*11:55.480- 12:00.820* :  and the students are angry that 56% of state jobs are reserved for certain groups,
*12:00.820- 12:04.260* :  which they say allows the government to reward supporters.
*12:04.500- 12:07.360* :  I heard more about the protests from our South Asia regional editor,
*12:07.680- 12:08.860* :  and Barasan Etirajan.
*12:09.200- 12:14.500* :  There have been violent clashes between groups of students in various parts of Bangladesh.
*12:14.500- 12:21.540* :  The situation is really tense with rival groups protesting, holding rallies in the capital
*12:21.540- 12:27.360* :  DACA, as well as in the other cities like in Chitagong, police also were firing tear gas
*12:27.360- 12:32.640* :  shells to disperse the protesters, and then both groups of students.
*12:32.940- 12:37.200* :  One, the university students who have been protesting against this, what do you call a
*12:37.200- 12:40.700* :  quota system, affirmative action for a select group of people.
*12:41.020- 12:47.220* :  And again, they accused the student wing of the governing Awami League of attacking them
*12:47.220- 12:52.320* :  in several places, which they denied that they were deliberately targeting these students.
*12:52.960- 12:56.720* :  Now, we are getting reports of a number of students killed in the clashes.
*12:57.220- 13:01.060* :  We don't know what was the reason for the death, but the doctors are talking about
*13:01.060- 13:02.960* :  bullet injuries and head injuries.
*13:03.560- 13:09.560* :  So this is likely to trigger more anger among university students, and it is also can spread
*13:10.120- 13:14.800* :  to other educational institutions, and that's why we see the government is taking this action
*13:14.800- 13:18.180* :  of closing down schools for the moment now indefinitely.
*13:18.400- 13:20.580* :  Yeah, but not university, so will it be enough?
*13:21.260- 13:24.940* :  Because the universities come under different departments, different management,
*13:24.940- 13:28.980* :  probably they are waiting to see how the situation pans out.
*13:29.360- 13:33.420* :  Anyway, it's going to be a public holiday for the religious festival of Maharam.
*13:33.860- 13:38.160* :  But what anger the students was, the comment made by Prime Minister Shekassina,
*13:38.160- 13:43.740* :  because she was describing those who were protesting against this reservation system
*13:43.740- 13:49.840* :  as Razakars, meaning those who collaborated with the Pakistani authorities
*13:50.400- 13:53.840* :  when Bangladesh was fighting for its independence in 1971.
*13:54.620- 13:58.660* :  So those people always were looked down upon, criticised in the Bangladesh society
*13:59.280- 14:02.920* :  for not supporting the Bangladesh independence movement.
*14:02.940- 14:06.420* :  The Prime Minister's comments really triggered anger among students,
*14:06.420- 14:07.860* :  according to their representatives.
*14:08.020- 14:11.160* :  So quite an aggressive response from the government and its supporters.
*14:11.160- 14:13.980* :  Is it doing anything to try to address the problem of unemployment?
*14:13.980- 14:18.240* :  At the moment, no, because the people on the streets would say,
*14:18.260- 14:20.620* :  it's really difficult to find jobs.
*14:21.260- 14:23.260* :  Now, why they are against this quota system?
*14:23.320- 14:27.160* :  Is that nearly around 50% reserved for various categories?
*14:27.780- 14:30.940* :  But what they are saying is that the governing of Amir League is misusing
*14:30.940- 14:34.300* :  there is a chance that they could misuse this quota system
*14:34.300- 14:35.820* :  to bring in their own people,
*14:36.300- 14:38.040* :  an allegation denied by the Amir League.
*14:38.460- 14:41.880* :  And Basan, Etiraj and our South Asia regional editor.
*14:42.720- 14:47.220* :  The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has accepted the resignation of his Prime Minister,
*14:47.220- 14:48.220* :  Gabriel Atal.
*14:48.720- 14:52.600* :  After the recent elections resulted in a hung parliament split between the left,
*14:52.980- 14:54.500* :  the centre, and the far right.
*14:54.920- 14:59.180* :  As Huescofield now explains, Mr Atal will stay on as caretaker Prime Minister
*14:59.620- 15:03.120* :  until a new government is agreed, but that could take some time.
*15:03.880- 15:07.980* :  Gabriel Atal offered his resignation in the immediate aftermath of the snap elections
*15:07.980- 15:10.300* :  in recognition of his failure to win them.
*15:10.780- 15:12.620* :  Initially, President Macron turned him down,
*15:12.620- 15:14.580* :  but now he's accepted the resignation,
*15:15.140- 15:19.300* :  which means the Etal government becomes from today a purely managerial one,
*15:19.300- 15:22.960* :  running only essential business like, for example, the Olympics.
*15:23.660- 15:28.380* :  As soon as one or some of the political parties can agree on a potential new Prime Minister,
*15:28.760- 15:31.240* :  likely to command a majority in the National Assembly,
*15:31.240- 15:35.580* :  then that person should receive the appointment from President Macron to take over.
*15:35.960- 15:37.600* :  But France is nowhere near that point.
*15:37.600- 15:42.160* :  The left wing alliance, which came together successfully to block the far right at the election,
*15:42.160- 15:46.300* :  is now deeply divided and unable to agree on a candidate.
*15:46.900- 15:51.560* :  And the prospect of a centre-led coalition comprising some conservatives and socialists,
*15:51.800- 15:54.960* :  as well as the Macronites, is also a distant prospect.
*15:55.540- 16:00.480* :  Mr Atal may end up running the show in a purely technical capacity for some time to come.
*16:01.260- 16:02.540* :  Huescofield in Paris
*16:03.100- 16:08.640* :  The German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, has banned a magazine called Compact,
*16:08.640- 16:12.580* :  describing it as a mouthpiece for the right-wing extremist scene.
*16:12.580- 16:16.840* :  The organization's offices, as well as properties linked to its management employees
*16:16.840- 16:20.900* :  and shareholders in four German states, have been raided by the authorities.
*16:20.940- 16:26.660* :  The minister said compact, incited hatred against Jews, migrants and parliamentary democracy
*16:26.660- 16:31.940* :  in an unspeakable manner. Rebecca Kesby has been talking to Julia Ebner,
*16:32.380- 16:36.540* :  author of the book Going Mainstream How Extremists Are Taking Over.
*16:37.400- 16:41.980* :  She first asked about the legality of the raid and Germany's freedom of speech laws.
*16:43.260- 16:48.680* :  The German context is, of course, different from other countries for historical reasons that are
*16:48.680- 16:53.640* :  obvious, which means that in Germany we have much stricter anti-hate speech laws,
*16:53.880- 17:00.020* :  and the priority is usually given to shutting down any kind of voices that might be inciting
*17:00.020- 17:05.540* :  violence or hatred against minorities, for example, rather than freedom of speech.
*17:05.540- 17:11.160* :  For example, in the US we have the opposite case where freedom of speech is prioritized
*17:11.160- 17:16.800* :  over anything else. So I think we have these two very clear kind of contrasting examples
*17:16.800- 17:24.040* :  in the debate around free speech. Holocaust denial or any kind of symbols or logos relating to,
*17:24.040- 17:31.380* :  for example, antisemitism or far-eyed extremism are banned. I think they send it out to subscribers
*17:31.380- 17:38.000* :  in an envelope so that its headlines can't be read by people in the post, which kind of does give
*17:38.060- 17:42.820* :  a sense that they know that they're, you know, in century headlines. What are some of the things
*17:42.820- 17:47.240* :  that you've seen in this magazine? They've published logos, for example, that said,
*17:47.240- 17:52.780* :  invasion from Africa and with black people on the cover. They have also published things
*17:52.780- 17:58.100* :  talking about how the elites are planning the end of times. So they are spreading some really
*17:58.100- 18:04.160* :  violence-insighting views and also conspiracy myths. For example, the great reset, this idea that
*18:04.160- 18:09.240* :  the so-called global elites are trying to impose a dictatorship, a world dictatorship,
*18:10.540- 18:20.520* :  and completely change the international dynamics in a way that anti-populations would be controlled
*18:21.060- 18:26.480* :  by them. And they've also spread the conspiracy myth of the great replacement. So this idea that
*18:27.100- 18:31.900* :  white Europeans are gradually being replaced by non-whites, and that, of course, plays very much
*18:31.900- 18:40.260* :  into both anti-migrant and anti-Muslim views. But it also sometimes gives rise to anti-Semitic ideas
*18:40.260- 18:47.140* :  because there's then an added notion of the global true elites are behind this and also anti-LGBTQ
*18:47.560- 18:53.300* :  ideas. So the government has banned this magazine. Of course, people that like to read it will say that
*18:53.300- 18:58.940* :  that censorship that it's unfair. Other people may actually say that, you know, this is going to
*18:58.940- 19:04.620* :  force the people that write for that magazine or want to read it further underground. It's a really
*19:04.620- 19:11.180* :  tricky question, but of course, the ban will definitely limit the reach that the magazine can have
*19:11.320- 19:16.920* :  because right now it is the most powerful and the most wide-reaching far-right extremist media
*19:16.920- 19:23.460* :  outlets in Germany. Nonetheless, there is a wider ecosystem of alternative far-right media outlets
*19:24.100- 19:29.620* :  where I imagine that the attention will shift to other media outlets. And if they don't also get banned,
*19:29.620- 19:34.300* :  I think there will be new audiences for these other magazines and these other outlets. It is,
*19:34.300- 19:38.460* :  of course, also possible that this will create a massive backlash and can be counterproductive
*19:38.460- 19:44.640* :  because people will feel that they are becoming victims and being silenced. So I think there is,
*19:44.640- 19:50.600* :  of course, that dynamic. I'm not sure if banning media outlets is the most productive way and
*19:50.600- 19:56.480* :  the most effective way in countering these kinds of hate speech. Yudah Ebner talking to Rebecca
*19:56.480- 20:04.180* :  Kesby about the German government banning the magazine compact. Still to come on the global
*20:04.180- 20:09.480* :  news podcast, more clashes in Kenya as young demonstrators call on the president to resign.
*20:09.940- 20:14.200* :  These protests are different to any other protest we've seen in this country before.
*20:14.800- 20:18.280* :  The young protesters pride themselves in being leaderless.
*20:27.200- 20:31.900* :  It's summer in Britain and the crimes are just getting started. We found another body.
*20:32.300- 20:38.120* :  Stream the best of British crime drama only on Britbox. Don't miss new seasons of a claim series
*20:38.120- 20:41.980* :  like Blue Lights, which time at calls Belfast's answer to the wire.
*20:42.980- 20:47.980* :  And the responder, starring Martin Freeman in his international Emmy award winning role.
*20:48.060- 20:52.140* :  I can feel it. I'm going to crack stream the best of British crime drama on Britbox.
*20:52.460- 20:56.080* :  No, this is why I want to be a detective. Watch with a free trial today.
*20:58.220- 21:02.880* :  I'm Katrina Perry from the Global Story podcast. I'm at the Republican National Convention
*21:02.880- 21:08.900* :  in Milwaukee for a defining moment in the US presidential race after an assassination attempt
*21:08.900- 21:14.360* :  on former president Donald Trump. Republican and Democratic leadership have called for unity
*21:14.360- 21:20.100* :  and calm, but does that match the device of public mood? The global story brings you fresh
*21:20.100- 21:23.860* :  takes on smart perspectives. Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
*21:32.260- 21:36.560* :  More than 50 people are reported to have been killed in airstrikes in Gaza,
*21:36.980- 21:41.940* :  including in a designated safe zone. Israel says it was attacking Hamas fighters who
*21:41.940- 21:48.280* :  hid among civilians. The Hamas run health ministry says more than 38,000 Palestinians have died in
*21:48.280- 21:53.940* :  Gaza since the massacre of the 7th of October. Our special correspondent, Furgle Keen, reports now
*21:53.940- 21:59.480* :  on one of those deaths, a young man with Down syndrome who lived in the embattled district of Shujaya
*22:00.000- 22:03.120* :  and a warning that you may find parts of Furgle's report distressing.
*22:09.680- 22:15.360* :  Muhammad Bahar, a 24-year-old man with Down syndrome, lived with his family near Gaza City.
*22:16.340- 22:19.900* :  Here, his sister Nur offers him some grapes. He smiles.
*22:21.120- 22:24.300* :  Muhammad was also autistic and had suffered bullying at school.
*22:25.180- 22:31.100* :  His widowed mother, Nebula, his brother's sister, Nises and Nevus, were his comfort and security.
*22:31.940- 22:35.160* :  Nebula explains how the war magnified his fear.
*22:40.060- 22:46.600* :  He would say, hey, hey, thinking someone wanted to hit him, he was always scared, fearful.
*22:46.600- 22:51.240* :  We would gather around him and comfort him, though he didn't understand much.
*22:57.380- 23:01.840* :  Intense fighting returned to the family's district of Shujaya, a fortnight ago.
*23:02.660- 23:05.720* :  On June 27th, Israel ordered residents to evacuate.
*23:06.620- 23:10.180* :  But Muhammad's family stayed, exhausted by constant moving.
*23:11.420- 23:18.100* :  We evacuated 15 times. We would go to Gibriol's place, but then there would be bombing.
*23:18.100- 23:24.060* :  We would go to Heider Square, but then there would be bombing. We would go to the Rimal,
*23:24.060- 23:30.360* :  but then there would be bombing. We would go to Shawa Square, but there would also be bombing.
*23:37.100- 23:43.360* :  This is the sound of troops searching houses in Gaza. They moved carefully, fearful of ambush.
*23:44.200- 23:47.600* :  Often, dogs are sent ahead into rooms and tunnels.
*23:48.420- 23:52.440* :  Like this German shepherd attacking a Hamas fighter last December.
*23:52.440- 24:03.440* :  And the army raided Muhammad's house on July 3rd. His family says a dog immediately attacked the disabled young man.
*24:05.180- 24:10.460* :  I constantly see the dog tearing at him and his hand and the blood pouring from it.
*24:10.760- 24:17.160* :  This scene I will never forget. It stays in front of my eyes the whole time. It never leaves me.
*24:17.560- 24:21.100* :  We couldn't save him, neither from the dog nor from them.
*24:24.800- 24:28.880* :  Two brothers were arrested. The wounded Muhammad was taken into another room.
*24:29.720- 24:32.760* :  He was given some medical care, though it's not clear what.
*24:33.540- 24:37.620* :  Nebula Bihar says the troops eventually told the family to leave the building.
*24:39.340- 24:44.340* :  I asked them to let me take Muhammad with me. How could I leave him alone?
*24:44.340- 24:49.880* :  Who would take care of him? They told me Muhammad is gone. I asked what does
*24:49.880- 24:55.300* :  gone mean? Is he dead? They did not respond and they told us all to get out.
*24:56.100- 24:58.560* :  About a week later, the family was able to return.
*24:59.920- 25:05.400* :  You're hearing the voice of Jibril Bihar, as he shows a BBC colleague a video of his brother
*25:05.400- 25:12.440* :  Muhammad lying dead on the floor. There's a tourniquet on his arm. Goals used to try and stop
*25:12.440- 25:21.340* :  bleeding from a wound. Muhammad was lying here with his hand restrained with plastic and
*25:21.380- 25:26.420* :  gauze. They were trying to stop the bleeding. Then they left him without stitches or care,
*25:26.720- 25:28.600* :  just these basic first aid measures.
*25:33.660- 25:39.300* :  There was no autopsy and no certificate of death. No medical conclusion as to what exactly
*25:39.300- 25:44.700* :  caused the death. In response to our queries, the Israel Defence Forces said they were checking
*25:44.700- 25:50.840* :  on the report. Muhammad was buried in an alley between houses because it was too dangerous to
*25:50.840- 25:57.360* :  take the corpse to a mortuary or a graveyard. Faggle keen reporting. The BBC approached the idea for
*25:57.360- 26:04.140* :  a comment and is waiting for a response. Despite a series of concessions from the Kenyan
*26:04.140- 26:09.800* :  President, young protesters there have once again taken to the streets demanding his resignation.
*26:15.860- 26:21.360* :  Police opened fire on demonstrators, some of whom were throwing rocks. At least one person was
*26:21.360- 26:27.100* :  killed in a town on the outskirts of the capital Nairobi, bringing the total to 50, since the protests
*26:27.100- 26:32.080* :  began a month ago. The worst of the violence occurred three weeks ago when police opened fire
*26:32.080- 26:37.240* :  on demonstrators who had entered the parliamentary grounds. President Ruto was then forced to withdraw
*26:37.240- 26:42.240* :  planned tax increases and sack his cabinet while the police chief eventually resigned.
*26:42.240- 26:47.900* :  Our correspondent Anne Sawie witnessed the latest protests in Nairobi. She told me what they
*26:47.900- 26:53.840* :  were like. Chaotic, there were confrontations between the protesters and police and it appears
*26:53.840- 26:58.400* :  the strategy by the police was to ensure that they do not gather in large groups and therefore
*26:58.400- 27:03.400* :  the groups are much smaller and scattered in the central business district in Nairobi. Where
*27:03.400- 27:08.320* :  was, I have seen pictures from different parts of the country, there were also small crowds in
*27:08.320- 27:15.520* :  different towns, confrontations with police using tear gas, water cannons. There was also a person
*27:15.520- 27:21.920* :  who died just outside Nairobi to the south, a place called Kitingella, and that fueled a lot of
*27:21.920- 27:27.580* :  anger among the crowds against the government. Yeah, I mean, why are the protests continuing?
*27:27.580- 27:32.560* :  Given that the president withdrew the legislation that sparked them in the first place.
*27:33.020- 27:37.400* :  Well, these protests are different to any other protests we've seen in this country before.
*27:37.420- 27:43.580* :  The young protesters pride themselves in being leaderless and by speaking to different people,
*27:43.580- 27:48.460* :  either on social media or in the protests, they have different reasons for protesting. It has
*27:48.460- 27:53.960* :  evolved to protests against government excesses against corruption. They have multiple reasons
*27:53.960- 27:59.600* :  for going out to protest. Is there anything the government can do to end this unrest?
*28:00.020- 28:05.640* :  Given how the violence, the opinions are, it is not clear. And you know, this is the question
*28:05.640- 28:11.140* :  that is being discussed now, debated in different four-round, the local media. They are those who say
*28:11.140- 28:16.220* :  that the president must resign, but then what? There's no electoral commission in place to conduct
*28:16.240- 28:21.660* :  elections. Some protesters say that they want the MPs gone. There's a process to that,
*28:21.660- 28:27.680* :  some have attempted to collect signatures to recall their MPs, so it's a mix of so many things.
*28:28.200- 28:34.380* :  And so in Kenya. Next to Thailand, where there's been a mysterious but deadly incident at a luxury
*28:34.380- 28:39.580* :  hotel, housekeepers found six guests dead in a room after they failed to check out.
*28:40.060- 28:45.320* :  Police say poisoning is a possible explanation. One person on the booking is still unaccounted for.
*28:45.900- 28:47.960* :  Our reporter Jason Lee gave us this update.
*28:48.980- 28:54.460* :  The Thai Prime Minister Tastrat Tassin and the Thai police chief held a press conference
*28:54.460- 29:00.480* :  in this hotel. Now this is a luxury hotel in central Bangkok. Six bodies were found inside
*29:00.480- 29:06.240* :  this hotel room, two were Vietnamese Americans, four were Vietnamese nationals, three of them were men,
*29:06.240- 29:12.940* :  three of them were women. So far, what we do know is that no bodily harm was found on these bodies,
*29:13.560- 29:17.940* :  but an autopsy is needed to really establish the exact causes of the death.
*29:18.300- 29:23.220* :  Police say they suspect that they had been dead for around 24 hours. The bodies were discovered
*29:23.220- 29:28.760* :  earlier today at 4pm local time, but there was a room service order that came from this room
*29:28.760- 29:34.840* :  on Monday, around 155 pm, so it shows that there were signs of life until at least then.
*29:34.840- 29:40.920* :  They were supposed to check out today, so it's unclear what has happened since then.
*29:41.240- 29:44.980* :  The food that was ordered by room service haven't been touched at all,
*29:45.380- 29:52.480* :  and the authorities were able to find six glasses in the room, which matched the DNA of those who
*29:52.480- 29:57.900* :  died. Now six bodies were found, and now the five of those people who were found dead today
*29:57.900- 30:03.500* :  matched the hotel records, but the six body did not. It says the door was locked from the inside,
*30:03.500- 30:07.340* :  so police, you know, it's very unclear right now. They're not ruling out anything.
*30:07.720- 30:12.740* :  Jay Sung Lee. The comedy rock duo Tenacious D have cancelled the rest of their
*30:12.740- 30:18.060* :  tour of Australia, New Zealand and the United States, and apologised after a comment on
*30:18.060- 30:23.400* :  stage about the shooting of the former US President Donald Trump. Rachel Wright has the story which
*30:23.400- 30:29.640* :  includes views that some may find offensive. Actors Jack Black and Carl Gas formed the comedy
*30:29.640- 30:36.940* :  rock duo Tenacious D in Los Angeles in 1994. Their music won a Grammy in 2015 with what's been
*30:36.940- 30:44.000* :  described as mock music, a mixture of heavy metal and grunge and comedy. With Jack Black's theatrical
*30:44.000- 30:50.260* :  vocal delivery and Carl Gas's acoustic guitar playing, they've sold many records, played at
*30:50.260- 30:56.520* :  festivals and supported huge bands like Pearl Jam and The Foo Fighters. Jack Black is one of Hollywood's
*30:56.520- 31:03.140* :  biggest stars with parts in films such as School of Rock, King Kong and Kung Fu Panda. The band
*31:03.140- 31:13.380* :  was on a tour of Australia and New Zealand when this happened. On Sunday while on stage at the
*31:13.380- 31:19.920* :  ICC Sydney Theatre in Australia, a man dressed as a massive robot marched onto the stage holding
*31:19.920- 31:27.020* :  a birthday cake with lighted candles to present to Kyle Gas who was 64. Then Jack Black with his
*31:38.160- 31:41.920* :  hair pulled back in a ponytail said this. Kyle Gas appears to have said don't miss Trump next time.
*31:42.300- 31:47.620* :  A clear reference to the assassination attempt on the former president the previous day. The crowd
