*01:33.740- 01:37.420* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:39.760- 01:45.140* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Tuesday, the second of July, these are our main
*01:45.140- 01:51.560* :  stories. The US Supreme Court finds Donald Trump may have presidential immunity over his alleged
*01:51.560- 01:58.800* :  role in the January 6th Capitol riots. We need to say a big no to the Supreme Court for supporting
*01:58.800- 02:06.120* :  this guy. Hurricane barrel has made landfall on the Caribbean island of Karyaku with winds of
*02:06.120- 02:12.060* :  over 200 kilometers an hour. Francis Centrist and left wing parties battle to keep Marine
*02:12.060- 02:23.280* :  Le Pen's national rally party from power. Also in this podcast, all the Eritrean and African,
*02:23.280- 02:29.900* :  we must be proud. It's our moment, it's our time. Cyclist Biniam Gurme makes history as the first
*02:29.900- 02:39.560* :  black African to win a stage in the Tour de France. We begin in the United States with one of the
*02:39.560- 02:45.720* :  most closely watched Supreme Court cases. On Monday, justices ruled for the first time that former
*02:45.720- 02:51.880* :  presidents can have some degree of immunity from criminal prosecution. It was a major victory for
*02:51.880- 02:57.440* :  Donald Trump who faces prosecution for conspiring to overturn the result of the 2020 election
*02:57.440- 03:03.540* :  and for his alleged role in the 6th of January storming of the US Capitol. The Supreme Court
*03:03.540- 03:09.780* :  decision, six conservative judges in favor, three liberals against, means he is shielded from
*03:09.780- 03:16.320* :  criminal prosecution for actions taken in his official capacity as president, but not for private
*03:16.320- 03:23.380* :  actions. Mr. Trump's critics outside the Supreme Court were furious. We need to say no, a big no to
*03:23.380- 03:30.060* :  tyrants, a big no to the radical right, a big no to the Supreme Court for supporting this guy.
*03:30.820- 03:37.000* :  And in my opinion, this is a corrupt court that has kicked the can down the road to such a degree
*03:37.000- 03:42.640* :  that Trump will not get a trial before the election. Shortly after the ruling Donald Trump posted
*03:42.640- 03:49.080* :  on his social media network, a big win for our constitution and democracy, proud to be an American.
*03:49.640- 03:56.200* :  One of the dissenting justices was Sonia Sotomayor. She wrote that she now feared for the future of
*03:56.200- 04:01.760* :  American democracy, allowing a president to become a king above the law. For more details,
*04:01.760- 04:07.400* :  on what Mr. Trump is immune from, I spoke to our correspondent Nomea Iqbal in Washington.
*04:07.880- 04:11.880* :  It was Chief Justice John Roberts who wrote the opinion for the majority. And in terms of the
*04:11.880- 04:17.300* :  three categories, he said that there's official acts that are part of the president's core
*04:17.300- 04:22.600* :  constitutional powers. There are other official acts that are outside their exclusive authority
*04:22.600- 04:28.220* :  and then there's the unofficial acts. And so, presidents have absolute immunity for the first
*04:28.220- 04:35.340* :  category, presumptive immunity for the second and no immunity for the third. And it's a case of now
*04:35.340- 04:40.780* :  looking at the indictment and working out which part of the indictment goes into which category.
*04:41.480- 04:47.460* :  Give you an example, the Supreme Court said that the conversations that Donald Trump had with
*04:47.460- 04:52.400* :  his vice president at the time, Mike Pence, who he was pressuring to overturn the election results,
*04:52.400- 04:59.020* :  were covered by immunity because that was his role in an official act talking to his VP.
*04:59.800- 05:04.340* :  But then there are other examples that the justice gave in which talking to your vice president
*05:04.420- 05:10.660* :  isn't likely to be immune. And one of the crucial points that I think was in the opinion,
*05:11.260- 05:15.980* :  when the Justice has said that a president has immunity with respect to his official acts,
*05:16.400- 05:20.520* :  but also that evidence related to those official acts can't be brought to trial.
*05:20.560- 05:24.180* :  And so, you're left wondering how on earth does the indictment, as it stands,
*05:24.220- 05:28.120* :  goes through because effectively it kills it as it currently stands.
*05:28.540- 05:30.600* :  And this scathing statement?
*05:30.760- 05:38.120* :  Yes, just as Solemya wrote the dissenting opinion and she basically said that presidents are now
*05:38.120- 05:43.540* :  kings and she railed in particular that the majority declined to rule out immunity for Mr. Trump's
*05:43.540- 05:48.660* :  role in organizing faith slates of electors, also the way he was pressuring states to
*05:48.660- 05:53.660* :  subvert the legitimate election results, and also the accusation that he exploited the violence
*05:53.660- 05:59.020* :  of the January 6th rights to sort of influence the certification of the election results.
*05:59.520- 06:04.940* :  Often, justices conclude their dissents very politely, it's a very soft qualifier.
*06:05.140- 06:09.400* :  They usually say, respectively, I dissent, but she didn't put that, instead she concluded
*06:10.000- 06:13.580* :  by saying, with fear for our democracy, I dissent.
*06:13.880- 06:20.360* :  What impact is this ruling going to have on whether any trial of Donald Trump can ever proceed?
*06:20.600- 06:24.640* :  Well, this trial was supposed to happen on March 4th. I think we can say with a great deal of certainty
*06:24.640- 06:29.180* :  that it's probably not likely to be heard before November's presidential election,
*06:29.180- 06:33.680* :  because it's now up to the judge and the trial to work out which parts of the indictment
*06:33.680- 06:39.100* :  move forward. Donald Trump has the ability to appeal again. We could be here again where the
*06:39.100- 06:43.960* :  Supreme Court hears that they don't have to, but that is a possibility, which means that this
*06:43.960- 06:49.040* :  is likely to be heard after the presidential election, the American electorate won't get to hear
*06:49.600- 06:54.300* :  the evidence that has been presented against Donald Trump accusing a former president,
*06:54.560- 06:58.960* :  a potential future president of trying to overturn American democracy, and here's the crucial
*06:58.960- 07:04.580* :  point. If he does win back the White House, he will appoint a New Justice Department and
*07:05.580- 07:10.040* :  this is going to also infuriate all those people who have said that Donald Trump has
*07:10.160- 07:12.860* :  stacked the court in his favour and it's paying dividends for him.
*07:12.960- 07:17.320* :  Well, if you look at some of the polling, just recent polling suggested that seven and ten people
*07:17.660- 07:21.360* :  have low confidence in the Supreme Court. They don't believe it's impartial anymore. They
*07:21.360- 07:26.060* :  believe it's ideological. They have pointed out various rulings which they believe have been
*07:26.060- 07:30.080* :  handed to Donald Trump. Three of the Supreme Court justices were appointed by him,
*07:30.680- 07:36.020* :  and this ruling now will just confirm that for lots of people. There's also a lot of controversy
*07:36.020- 07:41.140* :  outside the Supreme Court chambers where two of the Conservative justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence
*07:41.140- 07:47.680* :  Thomas, are accused of not being impartial, particularly in relation to their wives who have
*07:47.680- 07:54.340* :  been accused of being pro-Trump and believing his unsubstantiated claim that the election was stolen,
*07:54.340- 07:59.680* :  the justices have always denied that they are influenced in that way, but it doesn't
*07:59.680- 08:04.980* :  come at the fears that people have about this Supreme Court and even President Biden himself
*08:04.980- 08:12.200* :  has referred to the Supreme Court as Trump's Supreme Court. Nomiya Ikbal, an extremely dangerous
*08:12.200- 08:17.380* :  category for storm is moving through the Caribbean, forcing thousands of people to take shelter
*08:17.380- 08:23.920* :  in their homes, churches and community centres. Hurricane Barrel is the earliest named
*08:23.920- 08:30.740* :  category for Atlantic storm ever recorded, and with wind speeds of more than 215 kilometres an
*08:30.740- 08:37.480* :  hour, forecasters have described it as extremely dangerous. It first hit Karyaku in Grenada,
*08:37.860- 08:44.580* :  but warnings have now been issued in St Lucia, Tobago and Barbados, where these residents are not
*08:44.580- 08:51.340* :  taking any chances. The windows are already secured on board it up. I have my water bottle water
*08:51.340- 08:58.360* :  and collected water. I have my extra food stuff, my batteries. Everything you can think about
*08:58.360- 09:06.740* :  they're getting, almost out of search lights, station cards, ladders, tea. Our Latin America correspondent
*09:06.760- 09:12.680* :  Will Grant has been following developments. It's very hard when communications are so patches,
*09:12.680- 09:17.960* :  you can imagine they are as the hurricane makes its way through the Caribbean to get a full
*09:17.960- 09:24.340* :  picture, but yes, it does sound like Grenada and these smaller islands off the coast of Grenada have
*09:24.360- 09:30.060* :  been hit quite hard as it's come in, obviously, feeling the full force of the hurricane as it makes
*09:30.060- 09:36.400* :  its way over the island. It is very likely, based on what I've been hearing from St Vincent and
*09:36.400- 09:42.460* :  the Grenadines too, that roofs have been ripped off homes. A reporter there has been telling me that
*09:42.460- 09:50.960* :  that's happened in numerous homes, businesses, churches, official buildings, he said. So we are still
*09:50.960- 09:56.960* :  waiting for a proper snapshot of how bad things are, but yeah, that is the indication that we're
*09:56.960- 10:01.340* :  getting. And I know we get a hurricane season every year, but it's not normally this bad this early,
*10:01.340- 10:04.780* :  is it? It's not. This has been pointed out that Hurricane
*10:05.940- 10:13.140* :  is really breaking records in that regard. It's the first time that a hurricane has intensified
*10:13.140- 10:19.460* :  to a category 4 storm from a tropical depression within just 48 hours, certainly in June and only
*10:19.720- 10:25.620* :  there's been six other occasions that has ever happened at all. So you know, it is a very fast
*10:26.300- 10:33.460* :  intensifying storm that has the potential to cause loss of life to cause real damage,
*10:33.460- 10:38.980* :  extensive damage across the Caribbean. I think the governments have been trying to get that word
*10:38.980- 10:44.040* :  out from the moment that it was identified as a major threat, but of course they could have
*10:44.040- 10:48.380* :  been caught on the back foot or communities could have been caught on the back foot by the speed in
*10:48.380- 10:54.760* :  which this has developed. Will Grant. The Israeli army has told Palestinian residents to evacuate
*10:54.760- 11:01.920* :  districts in Han Unis and Raffa in the south of Gaza. The warning came hours after Israel said 20
*11:01.920- 11:08.900* :  projectiles were fired into Israel from the area of Han Unis, at least analysts. Sebastian Asher
*11:08.900- 11:14.060* :  reports from Jerusalem. People in several neighborhoods in Han Unis first received audio messages
*11:14.060- 11:18.000* :  telling them to leave, which has since been followed by a message on social media from the
*11:18.000- 11:23.720* :  IDS Arab language spokesman itemizing all the districts that need to be evacuated. Witnesses
*11:23.720- 11:28.180* :  say that many people are already fleeing. The armed wing of a Palestinian militant faction
*11:28.180- 11:33.680* :  Islamic Jihad has said that its fighters fired rockets into Israeli communities near the border
*11:33.680- 11:39.280* :  with Gaza in what was the biggest such barrage for months elsewhere in Gaza. Fighting has
*11:39.280- 11:44.900* :  continued to rage in Mishuja'ia district in Gaza City for a fifth day while Israeli tanks have
*11:44.900- 11:52.380* :  continued to push ever deeper into Raffa. Sebastian Asher, France's centrist and left wing
*11:52.380- 11:58.660* :  parties are making a frantic attempt to halt the far right from taking control in the national
*11:58.660- 12:04.740* :  assembly. It's after Marine Le Pen and Jordan Buddell as national rally party won about a third
*12:04.740- 12:09.960* :  of the vote in the first round of parliamentary elections. Now President Macron's centrist block
*12:10.340- 12:16.620* :  and an alliance of left wing parties and negotiating sole candidacies for the crucial second
*12:16.620- 12:23.200* :  round of voting taking place on Sunday. Green Party candidate Charlotte Minveh says it's essential
*12:23.200- 12:29.640* :  that those opposed to the national rally work together. There's a real need for unity, all parties
*12:29.640- 12:36.700* :  that believe in our democratic values to basically pull out when they might favor the possibility of
*12:36.700- 12:43.220* :  the far right winning different seats. And the only alliance that's able to try to not have a
*12:43.220- 12:49.720* :  majority for the far right is our alliance on the left, the nouveau form populaire. We are a few
*12:49.720- 12:55.320* :  percentages into the national rally of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Benela. We need to do everything
*12:55.320- 13:00.340* :  that's possible to ensure that he doesn't become France's next prime minister. But national
*13:00.340- 13:05.600* :  rally's Mr. Bardela says a right wing parliamentary majority is still achievable.
*13:07.400- 13:12.120* :  I think that with our allies we will win the election to get a now-to-right majority on Sunday.
*13:13.000- 13:17.600* :  That is our aim. So I call on the French to stay mobilized. And once we have that majority,
*13:17.600- 13:22.940* :  I will be forming a government of national union to put in place our program of national recovery.
*13:23.540- 13:28.960* :  Just what realistic chance is there, then, of an alliance succeeding in halting the right.
*13:28.960- 13:34.660* :  A question for our Paris correspondent Andrew Harding. It's a scramble and it's a gamble and
*13:34.700- 13:42.000* :  it's a mess. And today the opposition parties, they've all been either meeting or plotting or
*13:42.000- 13:49.020* :  doing the maths to see who will step down so that there is only one candidate opposing the far
*13:49.020- 13:55.760* :  right in any of these constituency elections. It's not been that easy and it's not clear either whether
*13:55.760- 14:01.000* :  these parties and their party leaders really have the control they think they might do over the
*14:01.000- 14:05.740* :  electorate. I mean, it was a time I think when people did do as their party leaders wanted,
*14:05.800- 14:09.960* :  but these days there's so much frustration with the political elites with a bit of political
*14:09.960- 14:15.100* :  process. That's part of why the national rally is doing so well that it may well be that voters
*14:15.100- 14:21.680* :  simply ignore them. But the markets, they are starting to think that the national rally won't get
*14:21.680- 14:27.320* :  enough support in the second round to form a clear majority and get into power as the government,
*14:27.320- 14:33.040* :  which would be a dramatic moment for France. They think that they probably will fall just under
*14:33.040- 14:37.960* :  that, but I spoke to a pollster earlier today. He was saying, well, a lot of my colleagues think
*14:37.960- 14:44.660* :  that the national rally might yet win enough votes. So in Paris, moderate, centrist, usually pro-Macron,
*14:44.660- 14:49.040* :  Paris, no one likes Macroining while everyone in France seems to have had enough of him, but a lot
*14:49.040- 14:55.040* :  of people saying, oh my god, it feels like a hangover. It's a word I've heard a few times from people
*14:55.100- 15:02.260* :  here in the north, in places where Marine Le Pen is very popular. There have been wild celebrations
*15:02.360- 15:07.060* :  and different sorts of hangovers, I suppose, this morning. People very excited at the prospect
*15:07.060- 15:13.060* :  that the national rally after so long, really, on the fringes of French political life,
*15:13.100- 15:18.180* :  might be not just coming to the mainstream, which it already really has, but actually coming
*15:18.180- 15:22.280* :  into a position where it could exercise real power. And of course, people looking three years
*15:22.280- 15:27.300* :  down the line and thinking Marine Le Pen might actually become president now.
*15:27.680- 15:33.360* :  Andrew Harding, such a result for the far right would once have been unthinkable because of the
*15:33.360- 15:39.400* :  national rallies post-war origins. It was founded as the front national by Marine Le Pen's father
*15:39.400- 15:46.260* :  Jean-Marie, and at the time, its ranks included some who fought for the Nazis. Philippe Malier is
*15:46.260- 15:51.920* :  professor of French and European politics at University College London. He told Sarah Montague
*15:52.320- 15:58.020* :  what kind of power a national rally prime minister would wield, and what they will do with it.
*15:58.680- 16:03.880* :  President Macron was thin power, regardless of the outcome of the election. However,
*16:03.880- 16:09.520* :  the power he will keep as president will very much depend on the outcome of that election.
*16:09.800- 16:15.200* :  Should national rally win an absolute majority, is power would be greatly diminished,
*16:15.960- 16:21.820* :  and he's room from newer, politically, domestically, but especially in international affairs,
*16:21.820- 16:27.820* :  EU affairs as well, would be reduced. It would be a situation of gravitation between
*16:27.820- 16:31.560* :  presidents and government from different political parties.
*16:31.980- 16:36.300* :  If national rally win an absolute majority, how would they use it? What would they do?
*16:37.220- 16:41.460* :  I think if you listen to carefully what Bardela and national rally people have been saying,
*16:41.460- 16:46.440* :  they've been very keen to demonstrate that they can be trusted with the public finances,
*16:46.720- 16:51.720* :  and they won't be spending madly. They will be very cautious, very much in line, in fact,
*16:51.720- 16:57.700* :  with what Macron's been doing the past few years. So expect no great changes when it comes to
*16:58.080- 17:04.760* :  economic decision. It is more on the issues regarding French nationality, French identity,
*17:04.860- 17:12.580* :  they would really unsettle, if you like, what makes French people French? And they have a
*17:12.580- 17:18.700* :  series of measures which are to ban dual citizenship or nationality, or at least curb
*17:19.280- 17:26.020* :  the rights of people access to certain jobs. They would also suppress the rights of sorry,
*17:26.020- 17:30.760* :  which means that if you're born on French soul to foreign parents, you become automatically
*17:30.760- 17:37.040* :  a French citizen by the age of 18, that would be gone. It's also about banning the worrying of
*17:37.040- 17:43.880* :  the hijab in public spaces, which is contrary to French laws of secularism, where you should
*17:43.880- 17:49.900* :  be free to practice your religion. So on number of issues, they could very much antagonize minorities,
*17:49.900- 17:57.740* :  women, LGBTQI people, and that could probably sort of make the whole political situation much
*17:57.740- 18:04.420* :  more tense than it is at present. If national rally end up with perhaps just short of a majority,
*18:04.420- 18:10.060* :  but as the largest party, does Jordan Bardela end up becoming prime minister, but with very
*18:10.060- 18:17.140* :  limited powers? No, he won't take the job. Let's assume he falls short of it by a civil seat,
*18:17.580- 18:23.660* :  then he already said it's a poison chalice. Why would I do without a majority? So he won't take
*18:23.660- 18:30.460* :  the job. If he does that, we're left in a political conundrum because it's a hung parliament,
*18:30.460- 18:37.780* :  the main party is unwilling to govern. So yes, then Michael would try probably to sort of build
*18:37.780- 18:43.820* :  a kind of coalition with a bit of centre left, centuries to centre right, but would that be enough
*18:43.820- 18:51.800* :  to reach that majorities? And he can't dissolve yet again the House. He needs to wait one year for
*18:51.800- 18:56.880* :  that. So a very difficult time, of course, even in the far right way, but a hung parliament
*18:56.880- 19:02.320* :  would also be very, very awkward for him. Professor Philippe Malié speaking with
*19:02.320- 19:11.840* :  Sarah Montague. Still to come. We do not have any trust in our government at the moment. They
*19:11.840- 19:17.320* :  tell us they will reduce the tax, they will reduce the price of so many things, but every single time
*19:17.340- 19:23.580* :  that opens it happens. One week on from the violent clashes in Nairobi, Kenya, protesters are set
*19:23.640- 19:25.060* :  to head back to the streets.
*19:34.540- 19:39.200* :  Temp check. What kind of summer are we having this year? A family road trip summer,

*20:53.160- 20:59.140* :  Now to Pakistan where the country's first ever conviction for marital rape has gone through the court.
*20:59.540- 21:06.540* :  Rashid Ali from the Kaiba Paktun Kwap province was found guilty of forcibly taking and marrying his
*21:06.540- 21:12.900* :  then 16-year-old wife, South Asia original editor and barrison at a russian has been following the
*21:12.900- 21:20.300* :  case. The family of this woman now who's 18 years they say that they had agreed for a formal
*21:20.300- 21:27.200* :  marriage after this marriage was accepted. The girls side they were demanding a separate house.
*21:27.320- 21:33.780* :  Now that was not accepted and now the family of the girl alleged that Rashid Ali's family they
*21:33.780- 21:40.260* :  barged into the house and they took this girl she was 16 at that time and they forcefully married
*21:40.260- 21:45.360* :  and kept her for four days and they were she was released after a police complaint. If this had
*21:45.360- 21:52.240* :  happened three, four years ago this would not have seen the court but what happened was in 2021
*21:52.380- 21:59.840* :  the Pakistani panel court witnessed amendments where they also brought in marital rape as an offense.
*22:00.640- 22:07.060* :  Now in the town of Shangla the gender-based violence court today gave this judgment on two accounts
*22:07.060- 22:15.140* :  one for abduction and second for marital rape of minor wife that was the second judgment and then
*22:15.140- 22:21.640* :  they gave 25 years of imprisonment basically life in prison for Rashid Ali but his family members
*22:21.640- 22:27.540* :  were acquitted and Safir Mia is the lawyer for the family of the woman and this is what he told me
*22:32.880- 22:37.420* :  earlier. Now according to Safir Mia this was the first time in Pakistan's history that
*22:37.480- 22:42.860* :  such a significant judgment has been given with regard to marital rape even though there was
*22:42.860- 22:48.320* :  another judgment last year in sin province that was more about unnatural sex so this will
*22:48.320- 22:56.440* :  go a long way in educating awareness among the people. Pakistan has historically been a very
*22:56.440- 23:03.620* :  male dominated society. How's this going to be seen? We have had number of cases where the
*23:03.620- 23:09.900* :  family they can go and take the girl they can forcefully marry even if they don't want to live
*23:10.180- 23:16.240* :  with a man they have to live because the societal pressure that is a stigma. Now this particular case
*23:16.240- 23:22.180* :  has given hope for lots of women lots of families that if you don't want to live with a particular
*23:22.220- 23:28.060* :  man now you can go to the court and then if they were subjected to sexual assault which they now
*23:28.060- 23:34.320* :  according to law is a marital rape then they will get punished so this sends out a strong message
*23:34.320- 23:40.480* :  to the Pakistani society. So what happens next time? See according to this lawyer now both of them
*23:40.480- 23:45.580* :  are still married they were asked for a dissolution of their marriage that is spending in the court
*23:45.580- 23:51.740* :  so that verdict is expected and second Mr Rashid Ali's family can always go to a higher court
*23:51.740- 23:58.280* :  challenging this lower court verdict and Barassan at a Rajan. In recent weeks we at the Global
*23:58.280- 24:04.180* :  News Podcast have been closely following the volatile situation in Kenya which has seen mass
*24:04.180- 24:10.300* :  protests as a response to President William Ruto's controversial finance bill. Demonstrations
*24:10.300- 24:15.980* :  last Tuesday quickly turned violent with police using tear gas and live rounds on protesters
*24:16.060- 24:22.920* :  human rights groups say at least 23 people were killed. Although Mr Ruto has now withdrawn his bill
*24:23.420- 24:29.600* :  the problem of unemployment and cost of living is not over for many Kenyans with more protests
*24:29.600- 24:36.400* :  expected to start on Tuesday. Mr Ruto has pledged to keep the military off the streets provided
*24:36.400- 24:42.880* :  protests remain peaceful. I must protect everybody. I must protect the protesters and I must be
*24:42.880- 24:49.880* :  concerned about their lives. I must also protect innocent people who become victims of criminals
*24:49.880- 24:57.400* :  who take advantage of a peaceful democratic process. It's largely younger generations driving
*24:57.400- 25:04.280* :  these protests in Kenya where the unemployment rate for 18 to 34 year olds is nearly 40%.
*25:04.400- 25:10.720* :  That includes many who have come through university but still can't find a job. 25 year old
*25:10.720- 25:16.880* :  Ivy is one of them. She told my colleague Andrew Peach what led her to join the demonstrations.
*25:17.720- 25:22.820* :  I'm 25 right now. I finished school about four years ago but I still have to live with my parents
*25:22.820- 25:29.000* :  because even if I move out I will not be able to cater to my own bills. I will not be able to pay
*25:29.000- 25:34.380* :  my rent to get food so I don't really have a choice but to live at home which is
*25:34.380- 25:38.780* :  unfortunately enough to have parents who can support me but there's so many people who do not have
*25:38.780- 25:43.660* :  that so they're forced to look for other ways to make money to sustain their livelihoods.
*25:44.120- 25:48.920* :  You joined the protests last week. Tell me why you're involved in the process because there were
*25:48.920- 25:54.760* :  very specific things in your family. Yes because I appreciate that the government has decided to drop
*25:54.760- 26:00.180* :  the view but it's taken too much for us to get here. So many lives have been lost but when we
*26:00.180- 26:05.180* :  people try to talk to they don't want to talk about it or they don't really care. All they
*26:05.180- 26:10.200* :  care about is the amount of money that was lost during the protests when really there's more
*26:10.200- 26:16.660* :  that happened. There was also something in the finance bill where instead of people owning land
*26:16.660- 26:22.060* :  the state will take it back and people would need to pay the government some amount of money.
*26:22.460- 26:28.480* :  My dad is a farmer and the money he gets from that is what has been able to give us the life we
*26:28.480- 26:32.860* :  have right now. If that happened and there was more money that he needed to pay to the government
*26:32.860- 26:38.680* :  I don't really see how that will be helpful to any citizen. Do you think the finance bill is
*26:38.680- 26:42.360* :  actually gone? We know the president refused to sign it but do you think the threat of those
*26:42.360- 26:47.760* :  motions has gone away? We do not have any trust in our government at the moment. They know how to
*26:47.760- 26:52.400* :  tell us things. They tell us they will reduce the tax. They will reduce the price of bread. They
*26:52.400- 26:58.120* :  will reduce the price of so many things but every single time the opposite happens. So right now
*26:58.120- 27:03.540* :  the finance bill has been withdrawn but we still have to be on the lookout because we don't we don't
*27:03.540- 27:08.220* :  know what to expect. We always expect the worst and unfortunately it always comes to pass.
*27:09.000- 27:15.000* :  25-year-old Ivy speaking to my colleague Andrew Peach about the economic problems faced by many
*27:15.000- 27:22.060* :  young Kenyans. New UN environmental measures came into force on Monday which stop any ships
*27:22.060- 27:29.380* :  sailing through the Arctic from using or carrying what is known as heavy fuel oil. HFO is the
*27:29.380- 27:34.680* :  most widely used fuel in marine transportation but it's also one of the dirtiest and most
*27:34.960- 27:40.060* :  environmentally damaging. Many campaigners have welcomed the ban although others say it does not
*27:40.060- 27:46.560* :  go far enough. Environment correspondent Matt McGraw reports. Produced from the waste left over in
*27:46.560- 27:53.540* :  the refining process heavy fuel oil poses particular problems in Arctic waters. This sludge like
*27:53.540- 27:59.340* :  substance is almost impossible to clean up if a spill occurs. Burning the oil in ships engines
*27:59.340- 28:04.640* :  generates huge amounts of planet warming gas and it also produces large amounts of
*28:04.640- 28:10.580* :  city particles called black carbon. These attract more heat to the Arctic and like grit on icy
*28:10.580- 28:17.060* :  roads helps speed up the melting of snow and ice. Supporters of the ban argue that many better
*28:17.060- 28:23.160* :  alternatives to heavy fuel oil now exist and surprisingly perhaps they say diesel is their
*28:23.160- 28:29.960* :  preferred cleaner option. Dr. Sean Pryor is the scientific advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance
*28:29.960- 28:35.840* :  campaign group. What we want to see is all the ships in the Arctic move to diesel or distillate
*28:36.840- 28:41.320* :  fuels. These are cleaner they don't produce so much black carbon they are easier to clean up
*28:41.940- 28:48.100* :  but also if you use a lighter fuel you can also install diesel particulate filters as we have on
*28:48.100- 28:53.300* :  cars and on land-based transport already that will then reduce the black carbon emissions to
*28:53.300- 28:58.300* :  virtually zero. While the new ban has been welcomed campaigners say there are far too many
*28:58.300- 29:04.100* :  loopholes and exemptions meaning around three quarters of the ships in the Arctic will still be
*29:04.100- 29:12.100* :  able to use heavy fuel oil for another five years. Matt McGraw finally cycling and in the third
*29:12.100- 29:18.060* :  stage of the Tour de France on Monday, Beniam Gurme from Eritrea became the first black
*29:18.060- 29:23.820* :  African to winner stage in the races 121 year history. Ella Bicknell reports.
*29:27.160- 29:33.020* :  Winning a Tour de France stage is often an emotional victory that this one was also historic.
*29:38.660- 29:43.720* :  That's the sound of Beniam Gurme's teammates congratulating him on winning the third stage of
*29:43.720- 29:54.440* :  this year's Tour de France in the Italian city of Turin. In a reduced sprint finish the Eritrea
*29:54.440- 29:59.900* :  empowered his way to pick Colombian Fernando Gaviria and Belgian Arno de Lille in what was
*29:59.900- 30:06.880* :  a chaotic end to the 231 kilometer stage, a photo finish which Gurme time to perfection.
*30:07.180- 30:13.860* :  I just want to say thank you to my family, my wife, all the Eritrea and African. We must be proud.
*30:14.600- 30:21.560* :  Now we are really part of the big races and then we success a lot of victories so now it's our
*30:21.560- 30:26.720* :  moment, it's our time. The Tour de France is considered the crowning glory of the cycling calendar.
*30:26.720- 30:32.800* :  African hopes were high for the 24-year-old to succeed here after his first grand tour stage win
*30:32.800- 30:39.420* :  at the 2022 Ferro di Italia. I can't believe it. To win a Tour de France second year in the big
*30:39.420- 30:45.680* :  blind sprint, yeah for me was unbelievable. Gurme says he's already looking ahead to the Olympics
*30:45.680- 30:52.120* :  in Paris later this month. I think it would be nice to represent my country on the Olympic games to
*30:52.120- 30:56.920* :  race with the national, one of the opportunities to race with the national team jersey and yeah,
*30:57.120- 31:02.560* :  I'm really looking forward for these two big months. Well before that he must endure 18 more
*31:02.560- 31:08.200* :  grueling stages to see the end of this year's tour. On Tuesday riders will cross the Italian border
*31:08.200- 31:14.260* :  to face the Calde Galabier, the first brutal climb of this year's race. Ella Becnault.
