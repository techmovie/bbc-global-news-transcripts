*01:00.260- 01:05.040* :  It's a question that keeps business leaders up at night. How do you go from thinking about change
*01:05.040- 01:12.180* :  to actually making it happen? How do I start? Where do I start? What is the use case? Where's the
*01:12.180- 01:19.380* :  value from the AI revolution? This is the most amazing time ever, and developments in AI are super,
*01:19.380- 01:25.020* :  super quickly changing. To the urgent need for sustainability and resilience. The physical
*01:25.020- 01:31.840* :  climate risk predicted in the climate models has arrived. The way we do business is transforming
*01:31.840- 01:39.220* :  fast, but we're here to help. I'm Chip Kleinexel, host of Resilient Edge, a new business vitality

*01:56.900- 02:00.140* :  podcasts. This is a global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*02:02.880- 02:07.860* :  I'm Janet Joliel, and at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 26th of July, these are our main stories.
*02:08.600- 02:14.020* :  France's train network is hit by coordinated arson attacks hours before the Olympics opening
*02:14.020- 02:20.000* :  ceremony in Paris. The former US President Barack Obama backs Vice President Kamala Harris
*02:20.000- 02:26.620* :  in her bid for the White House. Open AI launches its rival to the Long Dominant Google search engine.
*02:29.160- 02:33.560* :  Also in this podcast, the beautiful thing about going to the space station is that you're
*02:33.560- 02:37.300* :  taking gravity out of the equation. It's a complete unknown what will happen when you do that.
*02:38.020- 02:41.460* :  Meet Rosemary. She's going to the International Space Station.
*02:45.020- 02:51.040* :  We begin in Paris where anticipation is mounting for what should be a spectacular start to the
*02:51.040- 02:56.840* :  Olympic Games. The much heralded open air opening ceremony on the river's end. But it's been
*02:56.840- 03:03.300* :  overshadowed by what appears to be a coordinated campaign of sabotage just hours before a
*03:03.300- 03:09.200* :  waterborne parade of athletes is due to set off in the French capital. There have been arson attacks
*03:09.200- 03:16.660* :  on high-speed rail lines into Paris. The French rail operator SNCF says 800,000 people have been
*03:16.660- 03:21.820* :  affected with disruption expected to continue throughout the weekend. Many of those caught up in
*03:21.820- 03:27.700* :  the chaos were setting off on this summer holidays. Jean-Pierre Farandou is the CEO of SNCF.
*03:30.560- 03:36.420* :  Today was supposed to be the big holiday getaway. It's also of course the opening of the Olympic
*03:36.420- 03:43.060* :  Games. Many French people were going to come to Paris going to have fun. Take one, two, three days
*03:43.060- 03:49.820* :  to share in the joy of the Olympic Games. But that's been spoiled. Of course we will act. We will not
*03:49.820- 03:55.760* :  give up. We know we face difficulties. It will take a couple of days to repair, but we will get
*03:55.760- 04:01.840* :  things back on track. Eurostar trains between Paris and London have also been affected. Andrew
*04:01.840- 04:07.300* :  Harding is at the Gardenor's train station in the French capital. Big crowds and some confusion
*04:07.300- 04:13.940* :  here at the Gardenor in central Paris. Some trains are operating, but the high-speed TGV lines have
*04:13.940- 04:21.280* :  been disrupted by this coordinated attack across France overnight. And the security forces are
*04:21.280- 04:27.420* :  here. I've seen a lot of police, a lot of soldiers too on patrol. Lots of French people are
*04:27.780- 04:31.640* :  trying to get out of Paris for their summer holidays and of course a lot of tourists coming here
*04:31.640- 04:37.880* :  for the Olympic Games and for tonight's opening ceremony. No word yet on who might have been
*04:37.880- 04:44.400* :  responsible for these attacks. Big disruption, big concerns, but train officials here are saying
*04:44.400- 04:50.580* :  look we are finding ways to put those high-speed trains onto normal lines and it's going to take us
*04:50.580- 04:56.720* :  hours probably days to sort this mess out, but they are working on it. Our security correspondent
*04:56.720- 05:01.500* :  Frank Gardner told us more about the attacks and who might be behind them. They're being
*05:01.500- 05:06.320* :  closed as acts of sabotage rather than terrorism and that's an important distinction because
*05:07.100- 05:12.400* :  no humans were targeted in this. Obviously it's immensely disruptive. It's an attack on the French
*05:12.400- 05:17.760* :  state, on the French nation. It's hitting critical national infrastructure and of course a huge
*05:17.760- 05:24.580* :  embarrassment on the opening day of the French, of the Paris-based Olympics, but it's not been
*05:24.580- 05:31.600* :  seen as terrorism because there was nobody killed or injured in this. So the list of suspects
*05:33.220- 05:39.520* :  include far right, far left activists, environmental activists, but also possibly links to the
*05:39.540- 05:44.980* :  Kremlin because let's not forget that just under two months ago there were five coffins filled
*05:44.980- 05:52.060* :  with a substance that were covered in French trickle or national flags placed at the base of
*05:52.060- 05:58.200* :  the Eiffel Tower with the inscription French troops of Ukraine and that was in response to
*05:59.360- 06:04.520* :  French President Emmanuel Macron suggesting that France might possibly deploy troops to Ukraine
*06:05.280- 06:12.660* :  and that was ultimately linked to by French investigators to Tomosco which took no responsibility
*06:13.400- 06:18.160* :  for it at all and indeed there's no responsibility claimed so far for these arson attacks,
*06:18.160- 06:23.580* :  but they were quite sophisticated. Whoever did it knew exactly what junction boxes to hit,
*06:24.060- 06:28.880* :  which lines to hit that would cause the most disruption, three out of the four big TGV
*06:28.880- 06:34.460* :  high speed link rail lines were hit. The fourth one they managed to foil the attack,
*06:34.460- 06:40.220* :  but you've only got to look at the disruption quarter of a million passengers with their
*06:40.220- 06:47.980* :  journeys disrupted today up to 800,000 over the coming days. And you say this is because of sabotage
*06:47.980- 06:54.240* :  not terrorism, but there is unprecedented security because in the past France has been hit by terror
*06:54.240- 06:59.720* :  attacks. It has and you know there is still that risk just because this has happened it doesn't
*06:59.720- 07:05.760* :  of course preclude the risk of an attack in Paris itself, but what it's meant is that a lot of
*07:06.720- 07:11.140* :  security forces that would otherwise be deployed to the countryside have been pulled into Paris.
*07:11.140- 07:18.720* :  You've got 45,000 police and John Dams in Paris drafted in extra that's over and above what's
*07:18.720- 07:24.600* :  normally you know the forces normally there, 10,000 soldiers, 2,000 private security guards,
*07:24.600- 07:30.000* :  snipers on roofs, drones up in the air, the focus is very much on Paris and of course on the opening
*07:30.000- 07:37.300* :  ceremony this this evening with this parade on the river, 10, 6 kilometers. So there are risks,
*07:37.300- 07:42.340* :  but the French have taken great care to try and mitigate as many of those risks as possible.
*07:42.960- 07:47.480* :  It's interesting to back in an e-proprister, Mackerel said he thought Russia would try and disrupt
*07:47.480- 07:54.160* :  these games in some form. Frank Gardner, the former US president, Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle,
*07:54.160- 08:00.560* :  have joined other high profile Democrats to endorse Kamala Harris. America's first black
*08:00.600- 08:05.620* :  president gave his whole hearted support to the woman who is aiming to become the US's first
*08:05.620- 08:12.020* :  black and female and Asian president. The Obama's released a video in which they make a call to
*08:12.020- 08:22.180* :  vice president Harris in yet another boost for her campaign. Kamala! Hey there! Oh you're both
*08:22.180- 08:27.860* :  together! Oh it's good to hear you both. I can't have this phone call without saying to my girl
*08:27.860- 08:36.220* :  Kamala, I am proud of you. This is going to be historic. We call to say Michelle and I couldn't be
*08:36.220- 08:40.860* :  prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the
*08:40.860- 08:47.020* :  overall office. Oh my goodness. Michelle, Barack, this means so much to me. The words you have
*08:47.020- 08:51.760* :  spoken and the friendship that you have given over all these years mean more than I can express,
*08:51.760- 08:59.720* :  so thank you both. Well Jared Hill is a correspondent at CBS News. While former president Obama didn't
*08:59.720- 09:04.040* :  endorse vice president Kamala Harris a couple of days ago, we do know that a number of members
*09:04.060- 09:08.920* :  of the Obama world have been pretty heavily involved in the early days of the campaign. His
*09:08.920- 09:13.900* :  former attorney general is involved heavily with trying to vet various vice presidential
*09:14.480- 09:19.320* :  picks and candidates for vice president Harris. There had been some talk about him wanting to give
*09:19.320- 09:24.740* :  a bit of space between the announcement that Joe Biden was stepping out of the race that Kamala
*09:24.740- 09:29.780* :  Harris was going to be running in his stead and allowing this not to appear as a coronation. But
*09:29.780- 09:34.400* :  here we are seeing this official endorsement from one of the most popular democratic presidents
*09:34.400- 09:39.980* :  in quite some time. We've also been seeing over the past just a couple of days this flurry of
*09:39.980- 09:46.460* :  excitement and interest in grassroots efforts to galvanize various demographics that are going
*09:46.460- 09:50.960* :  to be important for vice president Harris. This potentially could just be another stamp of approval
*09:50.960- 09:58.500* :  from someone who a lot of Democrats like. Jared Hill. Open AI is launching a test version of
*09:58.500- 10:03.760* :  its long awaited search engine in a challenge to Google's lucrative online search business.
*10:03.760- 10:09.140* :  The company behind chat GPT says it's relying on its relationships with publishers to provide
*10:09.140- 10:14.940* :  timely and relevant answers. More from our North America business correspondent Michelle Flurry.
*10:15.700- 10:19.580* :  The company behind chat GPT is testing a new search engine that uses
*10:20.220- 10:26.600* :  Generative Artificial Intelligence to produce results. Now Open AI said that search GPT will
*10:26.600- 10:33.400* :  launch with a small group of users and publishers before a potential wider rollout. The search
*10:33.400- 10:38.740* :  engine starts with a large text box that asks the user what are you looking for after entering
*10:38.740- 10:44.900* :  your query rather than give you a plain list of links. Search GPT tries to organize and make
*10:44.900- 10:50.600* :  sense of them. The company's boss Sam Altman was full of fighting talk posting on social media.
*10:50.600- 10:57.660* :  We think there's room to make search much better than it is today. Right now it is just a prototype
*10:57.660- 11:04.380* :  but it could mark the start of a threat to Google's dominant search engine and it comes at a
*11:04.380- 11:09.620* :  difficult time for Google which is awaiting a federal judges ruling this autumn on a landmark
*11:09.620- 11:16.460* :  justice department anti-trust lawsuit which is targeting its alleged monopoly over the online search
*11:16.460- 11:23.220* :  market. Michelle Flurry. After a decade of economic meltdown and political repression could this
*11:23.220- 11:28.900* :  weekend be the beginning of the end for the Maduro regime in Venezuela. Voters headed the polls on
*11:28.900- 11:33.880* :  Sunday to choose between the long ruling authoritarian president Nicholas Maduro and
*11:33.880- 11:39.020* :  Edmondo Gonzales a retired diplomat and relative unknown until just a few months ago.
*11:39.600- 11:45.040* :  Tensions have risen as polls have shown Mr. Maduro trailing by a considerable margin
*11:45.040- 11:53.360* :  but his supporters remain positive. I'm going to vote for Nicolas Maduro because he is the one
*11:53.360- 12:00.320* :  that knows what the people want because he comes from where the people is. He also comes from
*12:00.320- 12:08.020* :  being very poor in the worst moments that his recent years have been going through. He has
*12:08.020- 12:12.760* :  looked for a solution for that. He's not looking for troubles, he's not just giving up.
*12:13.960- 12:19.220* :  Many Venezuelans fear that the polls will not be free or fair as Mr. Maduro has warned of a
*12:19.220- 12:25.740* :  bloodbath if he loses. The BBC's Mimi Swaby has been speaking to Enrique Capriless,
*12:25.780- 12:30.700* :  the opposition's candidate in the 2012 and 2013 presidential elections.
*12:35.220- 12:38.840* :  My expectations are for a massive participation of Venezuelans in the vote.
*12:39.460- 12:43.740* :  We have overcome the issue of not being able to vote. Venezuelans have rediscovered now the
*12:43.740- 12:49.140* :  desire to use our right to vote. The government has been using threats so much intimidation
*12:49.200- 12:53.680* :  and a lot of aggressive language but we're going to go out and vote with our families this Sunday,
*12:53.680- 12:59.560* :  the 28th of July. The will of Venezuelans will triumph. I think we're going to see a landslide
*12:59.560- 13:04.220* :  in favor of change and we hope that this change is cemented in peace without problems,
*13:04.220- 13:09.120* :  that democracy triumphs. It's logical that a government that has done badly loses.
*13:11.760- 13:17.000* :  Nicolas Maduro said that if he loses it could mean a civil war and a bloodbath. What was your
*13:17.000- 13:23.080* :  reaction to this comment? I'd agree with what the president of Brazil said,
*13:23.640- 13:27.640* :  who's also been an ally of the Venezuelan government since the times of former President Hugo
*13:27.640- 13:33.260* :  Chavez. I think these are messages of division for Maduro with the intention to promote not voting,
*13:33.260- 13:37.460* :  generate fear and terror. And this obviously scares Venezuelans.
*13:39.400- 13:46.720* :  You ran against Nicolas Maduro in 2013 and against former President Hugo Chavez in 2012. From your
*13:46.720- 13:53.020* :  own experience as the opposition candidate, do you think elections in Venezuela are free and fair
*13:53.140- 13:55.380* :  and do you think these ones in particular can be?
*13:57.500- 14:03.180* :  Election to Venezuela have never been free or fair. Never, including when the late President Chavez
*14:03.180- 14:08.180* :  abused his power with the use of public funds. This has been the sad story of Venezuela for all
*14:08.180- 14:14.500* :  these years. You know, I was a political prisoner in 2004. This is a story of abuses and it wasn't
*14:14.500- 14:19.560* :  just for a few years. For many years we had to survive with abuses and casualties with the
*14:19.560- 14:24.500* :  government taking advantage of the people. The big difference is that now the great majority
*14:24.500- 14:29.620* :  of Venezuelans are tired of this. It's a country where poverty is soaring. The country has decided
*14:29.620- 14:35.260* :  in its great majority to go out and vote and to overcome Maduro. The gap in support is so wide
*14:35.680- 14:39.980* :  that the government can't hide it. The election will be a great challenge because of many conditions,
*14:39.980- 14:45.420* :  but we're rising to this historic occasion to get rid of this undemocratic government through
*14:45.420- 14:53.860* :  democratic means. Venezuelan opposition figure Enrique Capri-Less
*14:54.780- 14:59.660* :  Two leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the most dangerous and powerful crime syndicates in
*14:59.660- 15:06.480* :  the world, have been arrested in Texas. One of them is Ismail Elmayo Zambada, who co-founded the
*15:06.480- 15:12.420* :  Sinaloa Cartel with Joaquin El Chapo Guzman, who's currently in a U.S. jail. The other man
*15:12.420- 15:17.640* :  arrested is El Chapo's son, Joaquin Guzman Lopez. Reports say the two men were tricked into
*15:17.640- 15:24.060* :  boarding a plane to El Paso by a senior member of the cartel in a U.S. sting operation. Our
*15:24.060- 15:31.260* :  Mexico correspondent, Will Grant, says it's a hugely significant moment. Enmayo Zambada, probably
*15:31.260- 15:36.860* :  certainly arguably the most important drug trafficker in the world. So the very fact that he's
*15:36.860- 15:43.500* :  evaded arrest for this length of time to have him now detained in El Paso is a massive step for
*15:43.500- 15:49.000* :  U.S. law enforcement. We don't know all of the details of the arrest yet, but it does look that he
*15:49.000- 15:55.440* :  was arrested when they came in on a flight from Mexico, we believe, into El Paso and was arrested
*15:55.440- 16:00.400* :  alongside El Chapo's son. We're beginning to hear that it looks like it might have involved some
*16:00.400- 16:04.700* :  kind of deal, that this one a sting operation, but there may have been some kind of deal between
*16:04.700- 16:09.840* :  U.S. law enforcement and one of those two men giving up the other. We need to hold off a little
*16:09.840- 16:15.040* :  bit from speculation at this stage, but certainly, I mean these things always sound incredibly dramatic,
*16:15.040- 16:21.800* :  I think, in this case, the drama is necessary. It was El Chapo who is the public face of the
*16:21.800- 16:26.240* :  Sinaloa cartel, but in many ways it was El Mayo Zambada who is the real power behind the throne.
*16:26.500- 16:33.180* :  If you think about drug trafficking as an enterprise, in a way what the Sinaloa cartel has done so
*16:33.180- 16:40.400* :  well is be able to adapt and grow and become so powerful, and part of that is El Mayo Zambada
*16:40.400- 16:46.080* :  and his leadership of it. So at one stage it's been cocaine, at other times it's been heroin,
*16:46.080- 16:49.800* :  more recently of course fentanyl, and I think these will be the charges that have brought
*16:50.400- 16:55.880* :  against him and El Chapo's son, specifically to do with money laundering, of course, drug-related
*16:55.880- 17:01.580* :  violence and of course drug trafficking itself. But yeah, I think that really lies and underpicks
*17:01.580- 17:07.600* :  why this has been such a significant scalp, why the organisation has been so powerful, so resilient
*17:07.600- 17:13.220* :  for so long, and a lot of that comes down to the frankly innovation of a cartel, like this
*17:13.220- 17:16.080* :  Sinaloa cartel and his leadership of it. We'll ground.
*17:18.580- 17:18.920* :  Coming up.
*17:23.860- 17:29.180* :  50 years after his debut album The Cape Verdean Singer, Tito Parish, speaks to the BBC.
*17:35.940- 17:40.620* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*17:40.780- 17:45.100* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally, when they announce
*17:45.100- 17:50.660* :  they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating
*17:50.660- 17:56.280* :  you. That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*18:10.580- 18:16.980* :  go from thinking about change to actually making it happen? How do I start? Where do I start?
*18:16.980- 18:23.680* :  What is the use case? Where is the value from the AI revolution? This is the most amazing time ever
*18:23.680- 18:30.600* :  and developments in AI are super super quickly changing to the urgent need for sustainability and
*18:30.600- 18:37.720* :  resilience. The physical climate risk predicted in the climate models has arrived. The way we do
*18:37.720- 18:44.900* :  business is transforming fast, but we are here to help. I'm Chip Kleinexel, host of Resilient Edge,
*18:45.260- 18:50.240* :  a new business vitality podcast paid and presented by Deloitte and produced by BBC Storyworks
*18:50.240- 18:56.740* :  Commercial Productions. It's a guide to implementing and sustaining change at scale. Coming soon,
*18:57.440- 18:58.640* :  everywhere you listen to podcasts.
*19:05.080- 19:09.760* :  The Brazilian government has for the first time formally apologised for its persecution of
*19:09.760- 19:15.000* :  Japanese immigrants during the Second World War. Thousands of people who were born in Japan but
*19:15.000- 19:20.920* :  migrated to Brazil were mistreated during and after the war. Brazil is home to the largest
*19:20.920- 19:25.900* :  Japanese population outside Japan. David Lewis is following the story.
*19:32.780- 19:40.220* :  Barbarities, atrocities, cruelties, tortures, prejudice, ignorance, xenophobia and racism.
*19:40.220- 19:45.800* :  Those are the damning words of an Air Almeida, president of the Brazilian Amnesty Commission,
*19:45.800- 19:51.480* :  an advisory board of the country's Ministry of Human Rights on the treatment of Japanese people
*19:51.480- 19:58.740* :  in Brazil during World War II. Miss Almeida also said in Japanese that Brazil seeks forgiveness for
*19:58.740- 20:05.040* :  the persecution of Japanese Brazilians ancestors. There was rejoicing and singing in the hall in
*20:05.040- 20:10.280* :  Brazilian after the announcement was made, men in traditional Japanese dress played music.
*20:16.540- 20:22.820* :  And it's an apology many decades in the making. The Brazilians joined the Allied side in 1942
*20:22.820- 20:29.180* :  and cut off diplomatic relations with Tokyo soon after. Then began a government sanctioned
*20:29.180- 20:34.680* :  confiscation of Japanese owned properties. Immigrants were not allowed to gather or speak Japanese
*20:34.680- 20:40.600* :  publicly. More than 6000 Japanese immigrants living in the southeast and port city of Santos
*20:40.600- 20:46.560* :  were forced from their homes over suspected espionage linked to the sinking of commercial ships.
*20:47.140- 20:54.100* :  But abuses continued after hostility ceased in 1945. The government cracked down on those who
*20:54.100- 21:00.980* :  argued that Japan, which had surrendered to the Allied forces, had won the war. This led to 172
*21:00.980- 21:05.980* :  Japanese immigrants being shipped to a concentration camp off the coast of São Paulo,
*21:05.980- 21:12.360* :  where they were interrogated and tortured for three years. Mario Hanukohara has documented the
*21:12.360- 21:18.140* :  persecution and insisted his ancestors were imprisoned, abused and accused of being spies.
*21:18.800- 21:23.520* :  We can't erase the atrocities committed against our parents and grandparents, he said,
*21:23.520- 21:29.320* :  but we can learn from these sad episodes and prevent them from happening again to anyone,
*21:29.320- 21:36.560* :  regardless of their origin or ethnicity. David Lewis, the town of Jasper in the Canadian Rockies,
*21:36.560- 21:40.920* :  is a tourist hotspot known as a stopping off point for people to admire the areas
*21:40.920- 21:46.940* :  crystal clear lakes and dazzling glaciers. Right now, much of it is a smoking wasteland,
*21:47.080- 21:52.220* :  after a huge wildfire ripped through the town. It's one of a number of fires affecting large
*21:52.220- 21:56.080* :  areas of the province of Alberta. This report from Stephanie Prentice.
*22:02.580- 22:07.940* :  In a video uploaded online, a man is driving slowly through Jasper, passing burned out cars
*22:07.940- 22:11.620* :  and scorched plots of land, where family homes once stood.
*22:12.780- 22:19.020* :  There's Mom and Dad's house. The house in question now just a few rows of bricks on the ground.
*22:20.180- 22:24.120* :  In another video, a man is driving through the remains of his old neighborhood.
*22:25.940- 22:31.340* :  That's out of the street that it's sprinklers everywhere else. Nothing but chimney standing.
*22:31.780- 22:36.720* :  It's been a hot and dry summer in Alberta and the fire was sparked during a lightning storm
*22:36.720- 22:42.960* :  and soon spread out of control with winds pushing what first responders called a wall of flames
*22:42.960- 22:49.100* :  into the town of Jasper in under 30 minutes. The premier of the province, Daniel Smith,
*22:49.100- 22:56.520* :  fought back tears during a press conference. The town of Jasper and the parks surrounding it
*22:57.480- 22:59.060* :  have been a source of pride.
*23:03.740- 23:08.420* :  It was some of the most beautiful scenery in the entire
*23:09.820- 23:13.080* :  in the world. It's a feeling being expressed by many.
*23:13.100- 23:19.320* :  Karen DeCore was the owner of Maline Lodge, one of the oldest hotels in Jasper. Her employees
*23:19.320- 23:24.340* :  managed to get all of the guests out in time. Karen later saw the outline of her hotel on the
*23:24.340- 23:30.300* :  news completely engulfed in flames. She says her former community is now unrecognizable.
*23:30.780- 23:34.980* :  I can't even I don't even know what streets those buildings are on. I mean I've been
*23:34.980- 23:41.500* :  going to Jasper since I was born and I can't even recognize the buildings. That's how it looks
*23:41.500- 23:48.960* :  like a bomb. Major bombs went off. It's horrifying. There were more than 170 wildfires currently active
*23:48.960- 23:55.480* :  across Alberta, triggering evacuations and air quality alerts. And while the fires aren't
*23:55.480- 24:00.880* :  unusual, experts say their ferocity is being exacerbated by climate change.
*24:04.020- 24:08.260* :  Three hours drive south of Jasper is another of the jewels in Alberta's crown,
*24:08.260- 24:14.620* :  the Banff National Park. Now residents there, like Abby Evans, are being told to be ready to
*24:14.620- 24:21.060* :  evacuate too. We have an evacuations plan in place. I know that Golden the town near us has
*24:21.060- 24:27.400* :  got an evacuation plan too, just in case the fires spread to us as well. This time last week I was
*24:27.400- 24:35.240* :  in Jasper. I went camping and I woke up to deer and elk outside my tent and I learned yesterday
*24:35.240- 24:39.520* :  that the campsite that I was staying at was completely burnt down. It's heartbreaking.
*24:40.140- 24:46.440* :  Back in Jasper, firefighters are working to save parts of the town. Around 400 firefighters
*24:46.440- 24:52.800* :  from around the world are flying into help, including a hundred from Mexico, 200 from South Africa,
*24:52.800- 25:00.520* :  and a hundred from Australia and New Zealand. Stephanie Prentice. The American Space Agency NASA
*25:00.520- 25:06.280* :  has said it cannot give a date for when two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station,
*25:06.280- 25:12.760* :  the ISS, might be able to return to Earth. The two went up nearly 50 days ago as part of a
*25:12.760- 25:18.760* :  test of Boeing's Starliner capsule. But the spacecraft has been plagued by problems and engineers
*25:18.760- 25:22.920* :  have delayed the return of the astronauts until they can figure out what went wrong.
*25:22.940- 25:27.360* :  But this hasn't stopped other astronauts getting ready for their own space mission,
*25:27.460- 25:32.820* :  like Rosemary Cougan, who's with the European Space Agency, and is hoping to go up to the station soon
*25:32.820- 25:38.220* :  to study the human body in space. She spoke to Andrew Peach. They are always in
*25:38.220- 25:43.040* :  fantastically good spirits. They're keeping extremely busy on the space station doing a fantastic
*25:43.040- 25:47.800* :  science and helping maintain the station, and I'm sure they'll be back in no time whatsoever.
*25:47.800- 25:52.380* :  And it doesn't put you off willing to go? No, of course these things are challenging. It's a very
*25:52.380- 25:58.120* :  exciting test flight and I'm very much looking forward to my own mission, which should be six
*25:58.120- 26:02.560* :  months of the ISS in the next few years. Tell me about the research you're hoping to do when
*26:02.560- 26:07.440* :  you're there. There's a huge amount of research that goes on on board the space station. As you
*26:07.440- 26:12.460* :  start a lot of it centers around the human body, there's an awful lot about the human body that we
*26:12.460- 26:18.240* :  learn in terms of the immune system, cancer research, the process of aging. But there's also a lot
*26:18.240- 26:23.380* :  of things like materials and fluid science, fluids and foams and metal alloys behave very
*26:23.380- 26:27.080* :  differently in space. So I'm hoping to get involved in as many different things as possible.
*26:27.280- 26:34.080* :  It's one of those areas where rather than doing scientific research that's been done before
*26:34.080- 26:39.580* :  or it's quite similar, quite nuanced from stuff that's been done before, you're starting with
*26:39.580- 26:46.440* :  a much more blank canvas, aren't you? Yeah, it is very much a blank canvas. The beautiful thing
*26:46.440- 26:51.960* :  about going to the space station is that you're taking gravity out of the equation. It's a complete
*26:51.960- 26:55.920* :  unknown what will happen when you do that. Has this been a lifelong ambition for you?
*26:56.240- 27:02.160* :  Absolutely. I've always been completely fascinated by space and kind of space as an entity,
*27:02.640- 27:07.480* :  but really reaching my 20s or so when I started to realise that not only is space itself
*27:07.480- 27:13.060* :  fascinating, but actually what you can do in space is incredibly useful for humanity, for
*27:13.500- 27:17.080* :  for opposite of knowledge. I thought, wow, if you can put those two things together, then that's
*27:17.080- 27:24.480* :  definitely what I want to do. Astronaut Rosemary Cougan. Cape Verdean singer Tito Parish recorded
*27:24.480- 27:29.780* :  his first album when he was only a teenager. Fifty years on as a songwriter and performer,
*27:29.780- 27:37.080* :  he's become emblematic of the music of the West African Islands. The BBC's Danielle Yao of Yetska
*27:37.080- 27:42.900* :  spoke to him recently at Festival Med in Portugal. I'm here with Tito Parish. We are backstage,
*27:42.900- 27:50.260* :  as you can probably hear. Cape Verde is famous for its pristine benches, beautiful seas,
*27:50.900- 27:58.160* :  but perhaps more for its musicians and its musical style Morna, a slow, almost melancholic style.
*27:59.220- 28:03.640* :  So for those who don't know about Morna, Tito, can you tell us what it means to you?
*28:12.180- 28:21.020* :  Morna, Tito, Dumblos, American. Morna is like the American blues for Cape Verdean.
*28:21.020- 28:29.940* :  It's a sentimental music. It's like Portuguese fado, in a sense. So it speaks of nostalgia, of love,
*28:29.940- 28:38.140* :  of separation and distance. And every Cape Verdean, when they sing a Morna, they sing of this.
*28:38.940- 28:47.340* :  So Morna is love. It's the ocean. It's the mountains. Morna is a beautiful woman. It's like a smile.
*28:49.520- 28:55.240* :  So can we talk about that? You come from a musical family in Cape Verde. Tell us about what
*28:55.240- 29:06.780* :  the islands mean to you, how they shape your music. Cape Verdean has one of the oldest
*29:06.800- 29:14.200* :  musics in the world, which is the sea crashing onto the rocks and onto the mountains. That's music.
*29:15.420- 29:21.200* :  And all the husbands before getting married, they had to learn a serenade to be able to win over
*29:21.200- 29:26.820* :  their girlfriends. So in the mornings, they all wanted to learn to play an instrument, to be able
*29:26.820- 29:34.620* :  to sing that serenade. We have music in our blood. We're a musical people. Even if a Cape Verdean
*29:34.620- 29:40.660* :  doesn't play an instrument, they love to listen to music. When I was little, I saw so much music
*29:40.660- 29:46.800* :  being played. And you know, a Cape Verdean, even when they're just speaking, they're almost singing.
*29:52.880- 29:58.480* :  So then what's it like to leave the islands? You've come who've lived in Lisbon now for 40
*29:59.260- 30:05.460* :  something years. How do you feel leaving Cape Verde? How do you feel going back? How does it
*30:05.460- 30:18.140* :  influence your music being in Portugal? Practically every day I'm listening to Cape Verdean music.
*30:19.060- 30:25.360* :  Because when I lived there, I heard all these singers on vinyl. And I was utterly entranced.
*30:25.720- 30:32.300* :  And I said to myself, one day, that's going to be me recording a disc. And that dream was realized.
*30:33.540- 30:39.800* :  But you know, I have many, many singers who still inspire me like Banna or Cesaria Evora.
*30:40.280- 30:46.380* :  And I actually produced Cesaria's first disc. And it gives me great pride to work with them when
*30:46.380- 30:49.020* :  I was younger. My energy comes from this.
*31:01.180- 31:08.260* :  So that musical powerhouse of coming from Cape Verde, where you have such brilliant musicians,
*31:08.260- 31:14.940* :  and your families are so linked with inherent musicality, does that pass on them through the
*31:20.860- 31:26.280* :  genre? Yes, it happens. It's true. The great musicians all passed music down to their children.
*31:26.940- 31:32.380* :  My father had a group. He was a sailor. And when he got back on holiday, he'd get together with that
*31:32.380- 31:37.380* :  group and perform in the local area. But actually it was my oldest sister who taught me to play.
*31:37.380- 31:43.600* :  I was seven years old. And she taught me in my first guitar chords. And from then on she was always
*31:43.600- 31:49.700* :  like, no, not like that. Let me show you. And I started to work in it that way. Eventually,
*31:49.700- 31:55.280* :  she left the islands. And it was my brother who became my bassist. And we formed a group just
*31:55.300- 32:01.860* :  from members of my family. Tito Parish, talking about his music to Daniel Jetska.
