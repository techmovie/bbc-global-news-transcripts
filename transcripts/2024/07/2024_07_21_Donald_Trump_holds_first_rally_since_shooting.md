*01:21.240- 01:28.920* :  the BBC World Service. I'm Janet Gillil, and in the early hours of Sunday, the 21st of July,
*01:28.920- 01:35.080* :  these are our main stories. Donald Trump has addressed his first campaign rally since he narrowly
*01:35.080- 01:40.940* :  escaped an assassination attempt a week ago. Israel has carried out a series of airstrikes on the
*01:40.940- 01:47.200* :  port city of Hodeida in Yemen, which is controlled by the Iranian Batthuthi movement. The government
*01:47.200- 01:51.480* :  and the Democratic Republic of Congo has warned of a surging outbreak of
*01:51.480- 01:59.260* :  epochs in the country. Also in this podcast, this is a great way for us to welcome, you know,
*01:59.420- 02:03.800* :  the people from all over the world and to showcase what the best friends some ask to offer.
*02:04.540- 02:09.100* :  How France is planning to turn the Paris Olympics into a gourmet experience.
*02:12.040- 02:16.520* :  As we record this podcast, Donald Trump has been holding his first campaign rally since
*02:16.520- 02:21.820* :  surviving an assassination attempt a week ago. His defiant response after being wounded in the
*02:21.820- 02:28.020* :  ear has galvanized his supporters and boosted his campaign. In stark contrast to Joe Biden,
*02:28.020- 02:34.480* :  who's defying growing Democrat calls to stand aside and is still isolating after contracting
*02:34.480- 02:41.080* :  COVID-19. Like Mr. Trump's last rally, which was in Pennsylvania, this one is also in a key swing
*02:41.080- 02:46.420* :  state, Michigan. His vice presidential running mate, JD Vance, took to the stage before Donald
*02:46.420- 02:52.380* :  Trump to speak about his working-class background. He promised to change politics to appeal to
*02:52.380- 02:59.400* :  lower income voters. A big belief that I've had for a very long time is the politics I hate to say
*02:59.400- 03:06.840* :  it on both sides. Both parties were broken in very profound ways. Both parties, if you remember,
*03:07.440- 03:13.100* :  signed up for shipping millions of good manufacturing jobs off to Mexico and China,
*03:13.700- 03:17.400* :  until President Trump came along and said, we got to make more of our own stuff,
*03:17.400- 03:21.260* :  we got to make it with our own workers' hands, and we're going to do it for our own people
*03:21.600- 03:24.420* :  right here in the United States of America, right here in Michigan.
*03:25.860- 03:30.740* :  Then came Mr. Trump himself, who launched a scathing attack on his political rivals.
*03:31.600- 03:37.660* :  As we gather this evening, and take a look at still the democratic nominee, we're going to find out
*03:37.660- 03:43.960* :  shortly, maybe, I don't know. Let's do a poll. You know, I love doing polls. Who would you most
*03:43.960- 03:50.340* :  like to run against? We'll start with Kamala Harris, and then, and then we'll go,
*03:52.600- 03:57.000* :  and then we'll go to Crooked Joe Biden, and then we could possibly discuss if you have.
*03:57.940- 04:06.100* :  So, who would you like to most run against if you're us? If we want to win. Ready? Kamala Harris.
*04:10.540- 04:11.460* :  Crooked Joe Biden.
*04:15.260- 04:18.380* :  All right. I don't think we have to go too much further.
*04:20.460- 04:25.960* :  I spoke to our US correspondent, Gary O'Donney, who in the very noisy venue as Mr. Trump
*04:25.960- 04:32.260* :  was speaking. If you're expecting a lot of talk of unity, which is what I promised a few days ago,
*04:32.260- 04:36.840* :  you're going to be disappointed because there was none of that. This is the original Donald Trump.
*04:36.840- 04:43.060* :  This is full fat unleaded Donald Trump. This is him in full campaign mode attacking
*04:43.060- 04:50.120* :  migrants, attacking Democrats, attacking the media, attacking Joe Biden personally as well,
*04:50.120- 04:57.080* :  even a few months ago, suggesting Joe Biden had a pretty low IQ compared to his. He's been talking
*04:57.080- 05:01.340* :  about immigration a lot as you expect, he's been talking about manufacturing, talking about
*05:01.380- 05:06.900* :  crime, and particularly because we're in Michigan here, so he's been talking about
*05:07.800- 05:13.440* :  rejecting things like electric vehicles or great jobs back. So, it's pretty much what you'd
*05:13.440- 05:18.160* :  normally expect from a campaign, but he is in the challenge. And, you know, after what happened
*05:18.160- 05:21.380* :  last week, he even started taking a bullet for democracy.
*05:23.040- 05:29.760* :  And you can see, or you can hear, rather, that his supporters are really backing him,
*05:29.840- 05:34.700* :  they're cheering him, tell us about the venue they're in because obviously security concerns
*05:34.700- 05:41.640* :  will be high here. They're in a very buoyant mood, I mean, these are committed supporters,
*05:41.640- 05:47.880* :  they have delighted that their candidates survived last week by the grace of God in his words.
*05:48.560- 05:54.060* :  They queued up for hours before this rally, some of them camped overnight, many of them have been
*05:54.060- 05:59.620* :  left out solid in this sort of raw hockey venue, which holds 12,000 people, it's pretty full,
*06:00.720- 06:07.680* :  and they have cheered every sentence quite famously. This doesn't feel so much like an election
*06:07.680- 06:13.560* :  rally as a victory rally. Gary O'Donohue, Israeli airstrikes have targeted
*06:13.560- 06:18.900* :  Houthi rebels in Yemen. A day after the Iranian bat fighters claimed that managed to fire a drone
*06:18.900- 06:24.220* :  into Israel's economic hub, Tel Aviv, killing one Israeli and injuring several others.
*06:24.840- 06:29.540* :  In response, Israel hit oil storage facilities and a power plant in the port of Hodeida.
*06:30.100- 06:35.500* :  Images show huge fires with a massive black cloud drifting above. The Houthi
*06:35.500- 06:40.160* :  run authorities say at least 80 people have been wounded, most of them with severe burns.
*06:40.740- 06:45.640* :  In a video message, the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Kaland, said his country had sent a clear
*06:45.640- 06:54.520* :  message to its enemies. The fire that is now burning in Hodeida can be seen all over the
*06:54.520- 07:01.400* :  Middle East, and this matter has clear implications. The Houthis attacked us more than 200 times.
*07:02.380- 07:08.100* :  The first time they hit an Israeli citizen, we struck them, and we will do so wherever necessary.
*07:08.960- 07:15.240* :  The blood of Israeli citizens has a price. It's not forsaken. This is known today in Lebanon,
*07:15.240- 07:21.800* :  Gaza, Yemen, and other places. If they dare attack us, the result will be the same.
*07:23.100- 07:27.340* :  For their part, the Houthis say they've been firing at Israel since soon after the start of
*07:27.340- 07:33.160* :  the war in Gaza in solidarity with Palestinians. They've also been attacking western ships in
*07:33.160- 07:38.620* :  the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, upending global trade. The US and Britain have carried out
*07:38.620- 07:43.240* :  retaliatory strikes, but as our correspondent in Jerusalem, Paul Adams told us,
*07:43.640- 07:49.560* :  this is the first time that Israel has responded directly to the many Houthi attacks aimed at its
*07:49.560- 07:54.000* :  territory. They're making the point that after many, many months of what they call Israeli
*07:54.000- 07:59.940* :  restraint in the face of what they say are over 200 Houthi projectiles that have been fired towards
*07:59.940- 08:05.980* :  Israeli territory, the Israelis have felt compelled to respond. I think there was absolutely no doubt
*08:05.980- 08:11.720* :  following the attack early yesterday morning that landed right in the middle of Tel Aviv and killed
*08:11.720- 08:15.920* :  one civilian that some kind of Israeli action would be forthcoming and quickly.
*08:16.320- 08:20.380* :  And what was hit as far as we're able to establish? What do we think the targets were?
*08:20.760- 08:27.340* :  Well, there are videos showing huge fires raging along the seashore in the port city of Haydada
*08:27.960- 08:34.480* :  and we've geolocated those fires. It looks like they are oil storage facilities close to the sea
*08:34.900- 08:39.680* :  and in fact that shines with what the Israelis are saying just now which is that this was an attack
*08:39.680- 08:45.460* :  on the port. On targets, Israel says we're used for military purposes that the port, they say,
*08:45.460- 08:52.180* :  is one of the main supply routes for the transfer of Iranian weapons to Yemen and that the targets
*08:52.180- 08:58.220* :  that were hit were in the Israeli words dual use infrastructure, including energy infrastructure.
*08:58.820- 09:03.800* :  And is this the one off retaliation by the Israelis, do you think, or could this possibly
*09:03.800- 09:10.480* :  be the start of another escalation? Well, both are possible. I think the Israeli argument at the
*09:10.480- 09:16.220* :  moment, and we've heard this from the Defence Minister Galant, is that Israel reserves the right
*09:16.220- 09:23.820* :  to mount further operations of this kind if attacks continued to be made against Israel. I think
*09:24.180- 09:29.020* :  clearly the difference this time was that in those scores of previous attacks very little damage
*09:29.020- 09:33.340* :  was done and no civilians were killed. That was the first time an Israeli civilian was killed
*09:33.340- 09:37.820* :  and the Israelis are saying if you do that again, you can be absolutely sure we will hit back.
*09:38.760- 09:43.660* :  Paul Adams, well at the same time as it hit targets in Yemen, Israel is reported to have carried
*09:43.660- 09:48.920* :  out strikes in southern Lebanon, targeting a depot storing ammunition belonging to Hezbollah,
*09:49.200- 09:53.120* :  also backed by Iran. Several civilians are said to have been wounded.
*09:54.180- 09:57.440* :  The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo says an outbreak of
*09:57.440- 10:05.260* :  epochs is accelerating. They have now been more than 11,000 suspected cases including 450 deaths.
*10:05.260- 10:11.040* :  South Africa has also reported three deaths. The World Health Organization has warned the disease
*10:11.040- 10:14.920* :  is a threat to global health. More details from Will Bross.
*10:15.880- 10:19.380* :  The Democratic Republic of Congo's health ministry says it's putting in place additional
*10:19.380- 10:24.200* :  measures to try to stop the epochs cases spreading even faster. As has happened during outbreaks
*10:24.200- 10:28.640* :  of other diseases that are spread through close contact, the authorities are trying to trace people
*10:28.640- 10:33.820* :  who have met anyone known to be infected. That's a difficult job in Congo, a vast country with
*10:33.820- 10:38.440* :  poor infrastructure. There are fears that the current strain of the epochs virus is being
*10:38.440- 10:44.180* :  transmitted more easily and is more deadly than previous ones. There's also a risk of asymptomatic
*10:44.180- 10:48.780* :  spread between people who do not have symptoms and have no idea they're carrying the virus.
*10:49.620- 10:54.340* :  Will Bross, let's turn out to Bangladesh where at least 10 more people have been killed in
*10:54.340- 11:00.820* :  clashes in the capital Daca despite the imposition of a nationwide curfew to try to quell anti-government
*11:00.820- 11:07.300* :  unrest. In all more than a hundred people have been killed in the violence of the past few days
*11:07.300- 11:12.940* :  according to data from hospitals gathered by news agencies. The demonstrations were triggered by
*11:12.940- 11:18.360* :  the reintroduction this month of an unpopular system of quotas to give some highly coveted
*11:18.360- 11:23.480* :  civil service jobs to relatives of veterans. Students took to the streets to say the jobs should
*11:23.480- 11:37.340* :  be awarded on merit not because of family connections. Security forces used live rounds,
*11:37.340- 11:42.460* :  rubber bullets and tear gas against protesters who defied the curfew and blocked roads.
*11:43.360- 11:47.500* :  All this is happening as Bangladesh is largely cut off from the rest of the world.
*11:47.500- 11:53.300* :  With the authorities shut down mobile and internet networks in a bid they said to calm the protests.
*11:54.080- 11:57.640* :  In Daca many of the injured were taken to the city's biggest government hospital.
*11:58.240- 12:03.220* :  Babi Sheikah student was collecting donations to help others who'd been wounded during the clashes
*12:03.220- 12:09.200* :  with the security forces. This illegal government is trying to exterminate the students.
*12:09.860- 12:14.360* :  Wherever they find students they shoot them like birds. That's what's happening now.
*12:14.800- 12:20.160* :  Outside the hospital one woman Shaheeda Begum was mourning the death of her nephew. She said
*12:20.160- 12:24.440* :  the 16-year-old was shot during clashes between protesters and paramilitary forces.
*12:28.520- 12:34.860* :  My nephew was an innocent kid. He was such an innocent young boy. Why did they kill him in
*12:34.860- 12:41.920* :  such a cruel manner? I want justice. Professor Ali Riyaz is professor of politics at Illinois State
*12:41.920- 12:47.720* :  University. Just how serious a challenge does he think this is for the prime minister Sheikah
*12:47.720- 12:54.240* :  Sena's government after 15 years in power? What we have witnessed it clearly shows that there is
*12:54.240- 12:59.980* :  a huge discontent and it is posing a challenge to the survival of the regime. Despite the fact that
*12:59.980- 13:06.720* :  this movement started as the student movement for reforming the quota system. Now it has escalated
*13:06.720- 13:14.160* :  into a movement that is being participated by all walks of life. Yes, it is posing a serious
*13:14.160- 13:20.720* :  challenge which this government has not faced in the last decade. Can you give me just a simple
*13:20.720- 13:28.360* :  explanation about the problems with the quota system and why this issue is the issue that led to
*13:28.360- 13:35.420* :  these more widespread protests? One of the major part of the quota system is that it actually
*13:35.420- 13:43.360* :  provides jobs which gives it for the second and third generation descendants of those who
*13:43.360- 13:51.600* :  participated in the war of liberation in 1971. The issue here is not there against keeping those
*13:52.140- 13:59.140* :  but the numbers. Now that it is putting to the second and third generation there is widespread
*13:59.140- 14:04.440* :  understanding that the system has been abused and this has benefited those who are close to the
*14:05.460- 14:10.660* :  regime. So that is what actually is with respect to the reservation of the quota system.
*14:11.040- 14:16.440* :  All together 56 percent of the government jobs are reserved. When it started it was a quota
*14:16.440- 14:23.720* :  system issue but it escalated into something different because of the existing discontent,
*14:23.720- 14:30.160* :  political and economy. That has taken it out and beyond. Can the Prime Minister
*14:30.620- 14:35.300* :  bring about any change though because she is also under pressure from the families of freedom
*14:35.300- 14:42.400* :  fighters who benefit from that same quota system? As a matter of fact, she can. The government
*14:42.400- 14:49.140* :  executive decision can because the extent of the use of it, it doesn't have to be like this.
*14:49.240- 14:55.160* :  Nobody is suggesting that this should be completely eliminated. But 50 plus years later
*14:55.160- 15:02.860* :  giving it to the third generation that makes it a somewhat controversial and also more importantly
*15:02.860- 15:10.160* :  how fairly it is being used meaning that there have been reports that it has been abused by people.
*15:11.040- 15:16.980* :  So yes, Prime Minister might be under the pressure of the generation, the descendants of the
*15:16.980- 15:23.160* :  freedom fighters but there is a valid reason for that and interestingly enough there have been
*15:23.160- 15:28.520* :  commissions and committees who have looked into the quota system previously which are recommended
*15:28.520- 15:35.840* :  that this needs to be reformed and revised. Professor Ali Riyaz speaking to Syria Hatton,
*15:36.120- 15:39.980* :  the BBC asked to speak to government representatives but no one was available.
*15:41.320- 15:46.700* :  As services from airlines to healthcare, banking to broadcasting have mostly come back online after
*15:46.700- 15:52.200* :  Friday's global IT outage. There are warnings it could take days, possibly weeks for all
*15:52.200- 15:57.860* :  tech systems to fully recover and in the meantime people should be on the alert for criminals who
*15:57.860- 16:03.400* :  may try to exploit the situation. The massive worldwide disruption to Microsoft systems was caused
*16:03.400- 16:10.120* :  by a botched software update issued by a cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. Around 9,000 flights have
*16:10.120- 16:15.480* :  been cancelled since Friday. It's not just travelers who still face disruption, emergency services
*16:15.480- 16:21.280* :  trying to clear large backlogs especially in busy cities like New York, Anthony Almahera,
*16:21.280- 16:27.920* :  a paramedic told the BBC the outages had set the city's emergency 911 system back by decades.
*16:28.740- 16:34.640* :  All of the 911 system is using this Microsoft, Microsoft Cloud CrowdStrike software,
*16:35.320- 16:41.420* :  so I have no access to monitor units to dispatchers. The computers are shut down and dispatch
*16:41.420- 16:46.960* :  so they're dispatching through the old cardiac systems which was in place in the 70s and 80s.
*16:47.200- 16:54.000* :  The units that are out in the field, the ambulances are usually tracked via GPS to ensure safety
*16:54.000- 16:58.740* :  and other things and they cannot be tracked at the moment. And New York City's system, EMS
*16:58.740- 17:04.740* :  system, the ambulance system does five to six thousand calls a day. So as the day is worn on,
*17:04.740- 17:09.160* :  the call volume is starting to spike and it's getting harder and harder to keep up the pace.
*17:09.980- 17:14.700* :  Now services are returning to normal regulators will be looking at how a small software update
*17:14.700- 17:20.240* :  could have reached so much havoc. And with many people out of pocket to the tune of thousands of
*17:20.240- 17:27.200* :  dollars, who might have to foot the bill for the huge global IT outage? William White is a technology
*17:27.200- 17:34.240* :  lawyer. It's notoriously hard to quantify losses in these kind of situations. And even if a
*17:34.240- 17:39.700* :  business can quantify its losses, there's no particular reason that they would let the public know.
*17:40.360- 17:45.440* :  But I would be unsurprised if the losses flowing from this are well into the billions. I mean,
*17:45.440- 17:49.220* :  imagine if you're an airline that has planes sitting on the ground, not generating revenue,
*17:49.560- 17:53.440* :  you've got to pay compensation to passengers, you might have to pay to fix the problem,
*17:53.440- 17:58.860* :  you have to bring in a different flight crew. And so many businesses are impacted that the losses
*17:58.860- 18:03.260* :  are going to add up very quickly. And of course, some of the impacts are also going to be non
*18:03.260- 18:07.220* :  financial. Like if you've been sitting on the ground in an airport, missed an important event,
*18:07.220- 18:12.640* :  you've missed a hospital appointment, then you're never going to get that time back. And the
*18:12.640- 18:18.720* :  great irony is that CrowdStrike provides cybersecurity software. And the thing that's caused this
*18:18.720- 18:23.720* :  massive incident was an update to a piece of software that was designed to protect against
*18:23.720- 18:29.580* :  cyber attacks. So I've seen a lot of people commenting that there will be huge legal action
*18:29.580- 18:35.820* :  against CrowdStrike following this. I'm not so sure for a couple of reasons. And it all depends
*18:36.060- 18:42.440* :  on what is in the contract between each customer and CrowdStrike. So if you wanted to say that
*18:42.440- 18:46.940* :  CrowdStrike were liable for some of these losses, you'd need to show that they were in breach
*18:46.940- 18:52.460* :  of that contract in some way. And you might think it's obvious, look at what's happened. But bear
*18:52.460- 18:57.340* :  in mind that what we're dealing with is essentially a mistake. It's just one that happens to have
*18:57.340- 19:04.300* :  catastrophic consequences. So it might not be so easy to prove that breach. And then even if you can,
*19:05.000- 19:11.160* :  then it's really common for enterprise software contracts, for products like CrowdStrike,
*19:11.740- 19:17.680* :  to be negotiated from the service providers template. So you will probably find in a lot of these
*19:17.680- 19:23.640* :  contracts that there are very far reaching exclusions of liability. Say, for example, CrowdStrike
*19:23.640- 19:28.260* :  might have said, we're not liable for loss of revenue, loss of profits, indirect losses.
*19:28.660- 19:32.820* :  And a lot of the biggest losses we've been talking about are exactly those kind of things.
*19:33.460- 19:38.000* :  And then third, or even if you can overcome that, there are also likely to be financial caps
*19:38.000- 19:42.320* :  on their liabilities. So usually, by reference to the fees that the customer has paid,
*19:42.700- 19:47.880* :  you might think that that's unfair at first glance. But the usual argument that people make is that
*19:48.160- 19:52.600* :  the risk to the software provider of entering into a contract should reflect the reward that they
*19:52.600- 19:57.460* :  get out of it. There's a policy question, do we think it's fair that CrowdStrike should go out
*19:57.460- 20:02.540* :  of business because of what is essentially a mistake when the scale of the outage is because so
*20:02.540- 20:07.700* :  many customers have been happy with their product to date. Technology Lawyer William White.

*21:39.560- 21:45.140* :  You're listening to the Global News podcast. On the 50th anniversary of the Turkish invasion that
*21:45.140- 21:51.120* :  resulted in the island of Cyprus being divided between a Turkish and a Greek side, Turkey's President
*21:51.120- 21:56.980* :  Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said there's no point trying to reunify it or resuming peace talks with
*21:56.980- 22:01.780* :  that goal. He made the comments as he marked the anniversary by attending a military parade
*22:01.780- 22:06.640* :  in the Turkish occupied north, both a Cypriot President and the Greek Prime Minister back
*22:06.640- 22:11.400* :  dialogue to try to reach a peace deal. Our Europe Regional Editor Paul Moss reports.
*22:17.240- 22:22.540* :  The siren sounds at dawn in Cyprus exactly half a century after the invasion which left the
*22:22.540- 22:27.780* :  island divided. There had been years of violent conflict between the Greek and Turkish-speaking
*22:27.780- 22:35.540* :  populations with atrocities committed on both sides. Then in 1974, Cyprus said it would join Greece,
*22:35.540- 22:41.240* :  prompting Turkey to invade, to protect its people, Ankara said. There have been attempts to bring
*22:41.240- 22:47.520* :  the two sides together ever since. And today saw the Cypriot President Nikos Kristodolides once again
*22:47.520- 22:55.560* :  expressed this hope. If we really want to send a message on this tragic anniversary and
*22:55.560- 23:00.700* :  honor all those who sacrificed themselves in order for us to exist today, it's to do anything
*23:00.700- 23:06.960* :  possible to reunite our homeland. Peace proposals have involved creating a single Cyprus as a federal
*23:06.960- 23:12.880* :  state with enhanced autonomy for the Greek and Turkish-speaking sides, but that goal was rejected
*23:12.880- 23:21.400* :  today by Turkey's President Regip Tayyip Erdogan. We cannot get anywhere by ignoring the realities on
*23:21.400- 23:28.800* :  the island. We believe that a federal solution in Cyprus is not possible. There are still thousands
*23:28.800- 23:33.840* :  of people missing from the Cyprus conflict, volunteers still digging up the soil to find those
*23:33.840- 23:39.740* :  buried in unmarked graves. 50 years on, the bitter divisions which led to their deaths seem once
*23:39.740- 23:47.780* :  again unlikely to be healed. Paul Moss, an American woman who served 43 years for a murder she did
*23:47.780- 23:54.520* :  not commit has been released after her conviction was overturned. Sandra Hema is believed to have served
*23:54.520- 24:00.120* :  the longest known wrongful conviction of a woman in US history. Sophie Smith reports.
*24:06.640- 24:12.120* :  Sandra Hema has just walked out of a correctional center in Missouri where some of her family she's not
*24:12.120- 24:18.060* :  yet been able to meet is waiting for her. Now 64 years old Sandra has spent the majority of her
*24:18.060- 24:25.340* :  life behind bars for a crime she did not commit. When she was only in her 20s, Sandra was found guilty
*24:25.340- 24:31.720* :  of stabbing to death a liby worker called Patricia Geshk in a town in Missouri state she was given
*24:31.720- 24:37.420* :  a life sentence. But a recent review of the case found that there was no evidence linking her to
*24:37.420- 24:43.900* :  the crime except for her confession which was given under duress. The then young woman had been
*24:43.900- 24:49.660* :  heavily sedated in a psychiatric hospital while investigators repeatedly questioned her.
*24:50.060- 24:54.320* :  A judge ruled on June 14th that her lawyers had established what he called
*24:54.320- 25:01.520* :  clear and convincing evidence of actual innocence. But Missouri's Republican attorney general Andrew
*25:01.520- 25:08.140* :  Bailey fought against her release in the courts. Sandra was not able to walk free until a month later
*25:08.140- 25:13.820* :  this Friday when the judge ordered the prison to release her within hours or he would hold
*25:13.820- 25:20.380* :  the attorney general in contempt. Her lawyer Sean O'Brien said he was thrilled at the decision.
*25:30.560- 25:36.340* :  After four decades behind bars it's not going to be easy for Sandra to pick her life back up.
*25:36.980- 25:41.900* :  She won't be eligible for social security and it may be difficult for her to find employment
*25:41.900- 25:45.340* :  but she has been reunited with her family.
*25:57.260- 26:04.420* :  That report by Sophie Smith. Now tourism is a key part of economies like Thailand's but often the
*26:04.420- 26:10.180* :  money goes to big international travel firms. Now as Thailand tries to recover from the pandemic
*26:10.180- 26:14.160* :  it's looking at ways of helping local people benefit more from tourism.
*26:15.000- 26:19.540* :  One scheme is trying to help local communities by organising people into small companies that
*26:19.540- 26:25.460* :  can borrow money to create experiences for tourists. The social enterprise called local alike
*26:25.460- 26:31.240* :  then runs tools to those areas. William Kramer has been to the village of Pontye which managed
*26:31.240- 26:39.680* :  to secure a loan of $100,000 to find out more. So I'm just coming into this little area here where
*26:39.680- 26:45.980* :  there's a couple of ladies with a loom. Long has always woven mats for herself but now she's starting
*26:45.980- 26:54.600* :  to teach visitors. Long is going to show me how to make a key ring. A tour tour is to make them
*26:55.240- 26:59.820* :  and they're always happy to take their finished products home with them. They seem to re-enjoyed
*26:59.820- 27:05.720* :  experience. Local alike has been working here in Pontye for a year and a half. I take a walk through
*27:05.720- 27:11.160* :  the village with Somsak Bunkan whose nickname is Pai. He's the founder of the organisation.
*27:14.080- 27:17.900* :  The silk factory is another local attraction for curious tourists.
*27:20.940- 27:26.460* :  I actually enjoy it when they come to look around. It gives me a chance to share my knowledge
*27:26.460- 27:33.200* :  and it's rewarding. 62-year-old Tong Shre. When tourists come to our village they bring
*27:33.200- 27:39.120* :  another source of income. This allows us to teach our traditions to our children, giving them
*27:39.120- 27:44.720* :  the opportunity to work here and stay close to home instead of having to leave and find work elsewhere.
*27:45.020- 27:51.660* :  Pontye is located a seven-hour drive north-east of Bangkok. Pai has honed in on the region's unique
*27:51.660- 27:58.580* :  cuisine to draw people in. So wait, some ladies have just brought in round circular trays and they're
*27:58.580- 28:04.840* :  all full of dishes with their beautiful looking salads. This is very, very Instagramable. Normally
*28:04.840- 28:10.380* :  we have a chef like a young generation chef in Bangkok to come and teach and train them how to
*28:10.460- 28:19.660* :  do the decoration. This one is a chicken grilled chicken so they mix with the red ants. With what,
*28:19.660- 28:27.500* :  red ants? Red ants. Okay let's try it. In the old days people in this village ate a dish when
*28:27.500- 28:33.100* :  they were feeling under the weather. It said that the ants release a liquid which wets the appetite.
*28:33.860- 28:39.680* :  To be honest, the ants don't really have a strong flavour but they do make for a great traveller's
*28:39.680- 28:46.960* :  tail. Something to remember and maybe boast about in a hostel back in Bangkok. There is also another
*28:47.020- 28:54.900* :  advantage to having a really strong structure in place. They've had a well for years but the water
*28:54.900- 29:00.320* :  from it wasn't clean. The villagers had to go to the next village to buy their water and then they
*29:00.320- 29:05.680* :  had to bring it back. The bank was willing to give them that big loan and the village has used
*29:05.680- 29:11.700* :  that money to dig three more wells and install a filtration system. I took a look at it with Pai
*29:12.140- 29:15.980* :  and also with the woman who's responsible for running the new system, Moi.
*29:22.600- 29:29.640* :  Now we only pay 5 baht and it used to cost 13 baht. The villagers don't just use the water
*29:29.640- 29:34.580* :  themselves. They now sell it on to neighbouring villages. That money goes back into the village
*29:34.580- 29:40.260* :  company but it's not just the well. The fund has paid for community kitchens and a redesigned village
*29:40.260- 29:45.700* :  square. So far there's only been about 30 tourists to the village but the community is already
*29:45.700- 29:53.180* :  benefiting. That report by William Kramer. The Olympics in Paris are less than a week away and the
*29:53.180- 29:58.540* :  French hosts are hoping to show off not just their sporting prowess but also their Savoir Fair in
*29:58.540- 30:04.000* :  Oak Quasim. In a country famed for its rich gastronomic history, French chefs will be offering
*30:04.000- 30:08.780* :  pop-up restaurants and dining experiences to impress those who've come to watch the games.
*30:09.340- 30:15.660* :  Harry Bly. Reports. Millions of visitors are expected to flock to Paris over the coming weeks
*30:15.660- 30:21.100* :  to watch the Olympic games and there's plenty to enjoy. The swimming in the Sen,
*30:21.100- 30:27.980* :  sailing, surfing, skateboarding, boxing, break dancing, basketball, but also berth bourguignon
*30:27.980- 30:34.100* :  and Blancette de Vaux because it's France. So of course there'll be a focus on food.
*30:34.100- 30:39.740* :  I would call it it's a carn before the storm, you know. This is Gregory Marshall, chef and owner
*30:39.740- 30:46.460* :  of the Michelin Star Frenchy restaurants in Paris. He's one of 80 chefs who are setting up a pop-up
*30:46.460- 30:52.160* :  restaurant serving a range of cuisines to those visiting the city for the games. I will be cooking
*30:52.160- 30:57.780* :  for guests, you know, doing a little show and like, you know, talking to people. I think it's
*30:57.780- 31:03.220* :  going to be a great party. I'm really eager to see the city, you know. We've been waiting for it
*31:03.660- 31:08.680* :  for so long now. His pop-up restaurant is in a very well-known location and will be serving
*31:08.680- 31:16.500* :  spectators of the beach volleyball. Yes, it's right under the FL Tower. So, you know, I could think
*31:16.500- 31:21.980* :  of a world's way to spend a beautiful day eating great food and watching beach volleyball.
*31:22.280- 31:28.080* :  With classic French dishes like Moulphrite being served, also on Chef Marshall's menu,
*31:28.080- 31:34.100* :  a tomato tartlet served with strawberries and a basil sabillon. I mean, we're in the heights
*31:34.100- 31:40.160* :  of some, I don't know. We have beautiful products available. We'll be using mostly vegetable from
*31:40.160- 31:48.200* :  our farm that is 40 minute outside of Paris and something light and fresh. Other pop-ups will appear
*31:48.200- 31:55.000* :  in all of the key locations for the Olympics. There will be lobster ravioli at the palace of Versailles
*31:55.000- 32:00.880* :  catering for the equestrian events. At the skateboarding near the Palais de Tokyo, pop-ups will
*32:00.880- 32:07.900* :  serve gaspacho, bow and shokets. And there are two open-air brasseries being constructed on bridges
*32:07.900- 32:14.560* :  across the river Sen. Gregory Marshall is adamant. You can't take the gastronomy out of the French
*32:14.560- 32:19.860* :  experience. This is a great way for us to welcome the people from all over the world and to showcase
*32:19.860- 32:27.080* :  what the best friends ask to offer food and hospitality is part of it. And there's been a huge
*32:27.080- 32:33.040* :  work to showcase that. And I think, you know, it will make us all proud and we're eager to
*32:33.880- 32:39.440* :  and to make special moments for guests. To be clear, it's not all overly fancy food. Yes,
*32:39.440- 32:46.040* :  there's a rhubarb consomme and smoked aubergine with had a cream with prices reaching 8,500 euros.
*32:46.580- 32:52.000* :  But smaller, more typical French delights, such as quiche Lorraine, crepes and galettes,
*32:52.220- 32:56.460* :  will be readily available. And it's reported. There'll be hot dogs too.
*32:57.320- 33:00.600* :  Bet you're feeling hungry now. That report by Harry Blight.
