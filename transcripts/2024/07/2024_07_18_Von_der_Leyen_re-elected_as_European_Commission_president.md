*00:27.260- 00:32.780* :  lit mistest as to how our body is functioning physically and emotionally. Let's unravel the
*00:32.780- 00:38.440* :  mysteries around our skin and get to the heart of how to make everybody glow from the inside out.

*00:53.100- 00:59.120* :  I'm Andrew Pageant at 13 hours GMT on Thursday the 18th of July. These are our main stories.
*00:59.660- 01:04.820* :  Ursula Vondeline is reelected for another five years as head of the European Commission, promising
*01:04.820- 01:10.220* :  the EU a bigger role in defence and ambitious green measures. This is the continent's leaders
*01:10.220- 01:14.960* :  gathered at a stately home in England for a summit at which the British Prime Minister Kirstauma
*01:14.960- 01:20.160* :  is hoping to reset relations with the EU. Also today ahead of Donald Trump's speech,
*01:20.160- 01:24.600* :  the Republican National Convention, we hear from the man he's chosen as his running mate.
*01:27.060- 01:31.840* :  Also in this podcast, the team set up to represent the world's refugies at the Paris Olympics,
*01:31.840- 01:38.380* :  a step in the right direction for gay rights in South Korea and you've seen our figure skaters.
*01:38.720- 01:42.820* :  When they they're very tight and they spin round, they're very narrow and they stand up straight
*01:42.820- 01:47.140* :  they're going really fast. When they sort of crouch down, they slow down. It's exactly the same
*01:47.140- 01:51.980* :  thing it's happening there. An all too familiar problem, how getting a bit fat around the middle
*01:51.980- 01:59.820* :  is slowing down the earth's rotation. Members of the European Parliament have voted to hand
*01:59.820- 02:05.280* :  Ursula Vondeline a second term as European Commission President. European leaders had officially
*02:05.280- 02:10.340* :  nominated Ms Vondeline back in June. Despite that and efforts to shore up her support,
*02:10.340- 02:15.280* :  right to the end, the outcome of the vote wasn't certain. In her final pitch to lawmakers,
*02:15.280- 02:20.820* :  Ms Vondeline pledged to prioritize defence and security and to lead Europe through a period of
*02:20.820- 02:27.860* :  change. Europe cannot control dictators and demagogues across the world, but it can choose to
*02:27.860- 02:34.740* :  protect its own democracy. Europe cannot determine elections across the world, but it can choose
*02:35.660- 02:41.740* :  to invest in the security and defence of this continent. Europe cannot stop change,
*02:43.040- 02:49.660* :  but it can choose to embrace it and invest in a new age of prosperity and improving our
*02:49.660- 02:54.600* :  quality of life. In the end, she won pretty easily thanks to the support of the Left,
*02:54.600- 02:59.640* :  Centreright and Greens. I got this analysis from our Europe Regional Editor, Paul Moss.
*03:00.140- 03:04.320* :  She was in the end of her unifying figure and I think that's probably what helped swing it.
*03:04.320- 03:09.120* :  She's a conservator, a member of Germany's Christian Democrats, but she also won the support
*03:09.120- 03:15.060* :  of the socialist group even the Greens. She's also a figure of stability. I think we have to remember
*03:15.060- 03:20.420* :  the European Union faces all sorts of crises at the moment, obviously the war in Ukraine,
*03:20.460- 03:26.100* :  the possibility of trade battles with China, the uncertainty over the relationship with the
*03:26.100- 03:30.320* :  United States, with Donald Trump, poised to take the White House, and you've got to remember
*03:30.320- 03:35.080* :  she was the only proposed candidate. If they'd rejected her, they would start all over again,
*03:35.520- 03:40.280* :  having to find an alternative, leaving the European Union leaderless at this critical time,
*03:40.280- 03:46.860* :  and allow me to be just a little cynical. It's mid-July. I think members of the European Parliament
*03:46.860- 03:51.700* :  probably want to go off on holiday if they'd rejected her or be like you're at school,
*03:51.700- 03:56.100* :  the school break begins and you'll told you have to stay behind and they really didn't want that.
*03:56.420- 04:02.140* :  Okay, and in terms of what happens now, it's the same person. Are we going to get exactly the
*04:02.140- 04:06.940* :  same kind of leadership from Ursula von der Leyen, or is she made promises to do anything differently?
*04:06.940- 04:13.200* :  I think the same kind of leadership, yes, but she has made all sorts of promises along the way of
*04:13.200- 04:17.720* :  what's going to be on her agenda, and those are very strong. I mean, the main one we've talked about
*04:17.720- 04:23.000* :  is defence, far more cooperation on defence and security in the European Commission. She says
*04:23.000- 04:27.920* :  she's going to create a commissioner for defence, double the number of staff at Europe, the European
*04:27.920- 04:33.580* :  Police Force. She wants to create a more competitive economy in terms of particularly tech and
*04:33.580- 04:38.560* :  artificial intelligence. Lots of commitment on the environment. She says that they can't be
*04:38.560- 04:43.140* :  dependent on China for environmentally tech things like wind power, they'll increase
*04:43.340- 04:48.740* :  renewables, cut emissions, a lot of promises to help countries which are already suffering from
*04:48.740- 04:53.800* :  climate change, like Greece and Spain, and another big issue in the European Union migration.
*04:53.800- 04:58.460* :  She said they will triple the number of coast guards protecting the European Union's borders
*04:59.040- 05:02.720* :  and create something called a pact for the Mediterranean with all the non-EU countries,
*05:02.720- 05:09.560* :  which are on the Mediterranean from where migrants are leaving, and so I suppose in order to get
*05:09.560- 05:14.100* :  elected she's made an awful lot of promises, but that's given her now with quite a hard task ahead
*05:14.100- 05:19.580* :  of her. Europe is also on the mind of Britain's new prime minister, Keir Starmer. Fresh from his
*05:19.580- 05:24.700* :  landslide election win, so Keir has said he's keen to press reset on Britain's fractured
*05:24.700- 05:29.260* :  post-Brexit relationship with Europe. Today he gets his chance to do just that,
*05:29.260- 05:33.740* :  hosting a gathering of European leaders at a stately home in southern England.
*05:33.740- 05:38.420* :  And here's how he set the tone addressing the meeting of the European political community
*05:38.420- 05:45.700* :  gathered at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. Under my leadership, Britain will be a friend and a
*05:45.700- 05:54.640* :  partner, ready to work with you, not part of the European Union, but very much part of Europe,
*05:55.820- 06:03.820* :  not focused on the differences between us, but on the values that we share, united by our
*06:03.820- 06:09.580* :  determination to defend them. Our correspondent Rob Watson is there. The clip that you just played
*06:09.600- 06:14.920* :  there was very well chose, if I might say so, because it utterly summed up the zeitgeist if I could
*06:14.920- 06:20.120* :  put it that way of the message that Keir Starmer is trying to send out to Europe, and that is that
*06:20.120- 06:26.200* :  he wants the bitterness of the Brexit years over, that the UK no longer sees the European Union as
*06:26.200- 06:32.740* :  some kind of rival or competitor, but as a partner. But of course it's important to note that the
*06:32.740- 06:40.080* :  reset isn't instant and really what the Europeans are rather curious about is what exactly is that
*06:40.860- 06:47.360* :  Keir Starmer has in mind for this reset. What is it that the UK wants? And I guess that's what we're
*06:47.360- 06:51.320* :  going to find out over the coming months. That's interesting, so when I guess anyone would
*06:51.320- 06:56.800* :  warm to the mood music of better relations, closer relations, but they're there thinking, what's he
*06:56.800- 07:02.620* :  after? Yes, absolutely, because if you think about it, so Keir Starmer said, look, Britain is
*07:02.620- 07:07.500* :  rejoining the European Union, we're not going to join its main economic institutions, that's the
*07:07.500- 07:13.520* :  single market and the customs union. So if you're an EU politician here, you're thinking, okay,
*07:13.520- 07:22.720* :  what lies between reset and that? I mean, what exactly has it in mind? And I guess, I suspect that
*07:22.720- 07:28.200* :  the equation goes to something like this, that the UK is interesting, what it wants from the European
*07:28.200- 07:34.000* :  Union is what it can get, and so what will be interesting is how much flexibility will the European
*07:34.000- 07:39.800* :  Union show, and just how close does the UK want to get? I think it's a sort of a dynamic process,
*07:39.800- 07:42.580* :  if you see what I mean, Andrew, rather than something you could know right away.
*07:43.560- 07:49.280* :  Ukraine's obviously on the agenda, President Zelensky is there, also keen to secure good
*07:49.280- 07:53.900* :  relations and continued support from Keir Starmer. Yes, absolutely, and it was a very clear
*07:53.900- 08:01.420* :  message from President Zelensky, and that is, look, Europe, don't be bullied, don't be tempted by
*08:01.420- 08:07.300* :  anything Vladimir Putin might offer, offer you got to stick together. That is the only hope that
*08:07.300- 08:12.400* :  Ukraine has, and I couldn't have made this message much clearer, and we also had a bit of a dig
*08:12.400- 08:19.100* :  at the one European leader here who has visited Russia, that's Victor Orbán, the Hungarian leader,
*08:19.100- 08:25.260* :  saying that that just was not helping Ukraine, what would help Ukraine is unity.
*08:26.420- 08:31.140* :  Rob Watson, today's meeting also playing host to some interested onlookers. One of them
*08:31.140- 08:38.100* :  leader of the opposition in Belarus in Exiles, Fetlana Tikhonowskya. I'm here, and I came here on the
*08:38.100- 08:43.840* :  invitation of Prime Minister Keir Starmer. I want the leaders to understand that Lukashenko is
*08:44.200- 08:49.820* :  threat, but Belarus and the Democratic forces are fighting for liberating our country from
*08:49.820- 08:55.740* :  Lukashenko's regime, but also from creeping occupation of Russia. Then I want to raise attention
*08:56.200- 09:00.380* :  again and again to the problem of political prisoners. The number of which is increasing
*09:00.380- 09:06.580* :  every day in our country. It's a crime against humanity. It's a problem, not only for Belarus,
*09:06.580- 09:12.620* :  but also for Europe, because they lower the overall standard of human rights. I want the
*09:12.620- 09:19.040* :  countries to see Belarus, democratic Belarus, as a paternity, because without free Belarus,
*09:19.040- 09:25.660* :  there will be no free Europe and security Ukraine. So that's why it's so important to help
*09:25.660- 09:31.780* :  Belarus and assist Belarus and democratic forces now not to delay the issue of Belarus for one
*09:31.780- 09:35.440* :  day later. That was Fetlana Tikhonowskya. The weight loss drugs,
*09:35.440- 09:40.660* :  a Zempik and Wigovie have boomed around the world after starting out much smaller as a way
*09:40.660- 09:45.900* :  of managing diabetes, as well as changing the way millions of people around the world use and
*09:45.900- 09:51.720* :  view appetite suppressants. They've also completely changed one small community in Denmark,
*09:51.720- 09:56.800* :  where Novo Nordisk, the drug's parent company, is based. Last year, it made more than 12
*09:56.800- 09:59.940* :  billion dollars in profits. Adrian Murray reports.
*10:04.400- 10:09.640* :  Stepping off the training, Callum Paul, a small port term with 17,000 residents,
*10:09.740- 10:17.240* :  uncreated by a vast industrial site. The factory complex is made up of grey boxy buildings,
*10:17.400- 10:23.880* :  but there's also temporary cabins, towering cranes and the beginnings of new concrete structures.
*10:25.260- 10:30.620* :  An enormous expansion is underway, more than eight and a half billion dollars is being spent
*10:30.620- 10:36.620* :  right here. The local mayor of Callum Paul Municipality, Martin Dam,
*10:36.620- 10:43.460* :  takes me on a tour of Novo Nordisk's perimeter. We are the center where the medicine start.
*10:43.980- 10:50.260* :  About half of the world's insulin is produced at this site. It's also where semi-glutide is made,
*10:50.260- 10:56.540* :  the key ingredient for Wigovie and EZempik. Now you're coming into cream land.
*10:56.740- 11:03.900* :  The site is the size of 240 socket pitches. Around four and a half thousand people are employed
*11:03.900- 11:10.440* :  at the plant and a further 1200 rolls will be added, he tells me. We have a rule of thumb. When you
*11:10.440- 11:15.940* :  have one job inside the industry, you will generate three jobs outside the industry.
*11:17.060- 11:23.920* :  Novo Nordisk's rising fortunes and growing corporate tax bill has also boosted local finances.
*11:24.760- 11:31.380* :  Callum Paul has splashed out on a new public swimming area while a culture house and library are planned.
*11:32.480- 11:37.100* :  Looking over it all, it's cafe coaster owned by New Zealanders Sean Gamble.
*11:37.280- 11:42.260* :  Drive through the building area and you just get surprised how massive it is. For a small town,
*11:42.520- 11:47.460* :  I think there's an excitement about what it's going to mean. I know in five years it'll be totally
*11:47.460- 11:53.640* :  different here in a good way. Inside a hairdressing salon on the main shopping street,
*11:53.640- 11:59.540* :  Costa Megida Patterson tells me she's optimistic about Callum Paul's future. It's very good for
*11:59.540- 12:04.600* :  the town. You'll see a lot of shops have been closed, hopefully they will open again. But she says
*12:04.600- 12:10.940* :  many workers commute from elsewhere and the traffic is heavy. It will take half an hour just to get
*12:10.940- 12:15.120* :  out of the town. Sometimes I have to wait because I have to be in a queue and I don't like that.
*12:16.480- 12:21.940* :  Construction on the new highway to the capital begins in the new year and more than 1200 homes
*12:21.940- 12:28.640* :  will also be built. In a small country of less than six million people, Novo Nordisk is now
*12:28.640- 12:35.240* :  so big that it's having an outsized impact on the Danish economy, which grew four times faster
*12:35.240- 12:42.160* :  than the European Union average, but strip away the drug giant and it's a different story.
*12:42.580- 12:49.100* :  Last also is the chief economist at Danskerbank. Last year there was a 1.9% in peak growth in Denmark
*12:49.100- 12:54.080* :  without the pharmaceutical industry that would have been exactly zero. The flood of US dollars from
*12:54.080- 13:05.340* :  sales abroad has also resulted in cheaper mortgages here in Denmark. The largest shareholder
*13:05.340- 13:11.180* :  in the drug maker is the Novo Nordisk Foundation, a non-profit organisation that funds medical
*13:11.180- 13:16.220* :  treatment and research. Medefifer is the vice president of the Danish Chamber of Commerce.
*13:16.220- 13:21.780* :  If they were not owned by this foundation, I think actually they would not be Danish at this moment
*13:21.780- 13:27.580* :  because they would have been sold. So this foundation structure gives us more stability and more
*13:27.580- 13:35.040* :  patient investments. The market for weightless drugs is expected to be worth $100 billion annually
*13:35.040- 13:42.920* :  by 2030. So the race to meet demand from this small town isn't about to let up anytime soon.
*13:43.920- 13:49.780* :  Adrian Murray in Denmark. South Korea's Supreme Court has upheld a ruling that same sex partners
*13:49.780- 13:55.060* :  are eligible for the same access to health insurance as straight couples. It ruled in favour
*13:55.060- 13:59.900* :  of a couple who state health insurance with drew coverage because they were gay. These were the
*13:59.900- 14:07.400* :  cheers from their supporters that they appeared outside court. One of the men behind the case
*14:07.400- 14:12.960* :  said it was a step in the right direction. When I heard the ruling I couldn't hold back my tears
*14:13.500- 14:18.820* :  and I hope that today's good news becomes a stepping stone towards marriage equality allowing
*14:18.820- 14:27.340* :  LGBT people equal access to use the marriage system. Asia-Pacific editor is Mickey Bristol.
*14:27.980- 14:34.720* :  This ruling concerns a gay couple in South Korea. Initially the partner of one of the main
*14:34.720- 14:39.140* :  involved them was allowed to join the health insurance obvious partner but then the health
*14:39.140- 14:45.880* :  insurer withdrew that. The case came to court and the Supreme Court has decided whether or not
*14:45.880- 14:52.620* :  this partner is able to share the health insurance just as husbands and wives in straight couples
*14:52.620- 14:58.240* :  do in South Korea. It's ruled in favour of the couple saying essentially it would be discrimination
*14:58.460- 15:05.000* :  if this health insurance was withdrawn purely on the basis of someone's sexual orientation.
*15:05.320- 15:12.080* :  So that's the ruling. It's a very narrow ruling about a very specific case but it perhaps will
*15:12.300- 15:17.560* :  have further implications. Yes I was going to ask you about that. Do you think this indicates a
*15:17.560- 15:24.500* :  direction of travel when it comes to things like same sex marriage? Yes at the moment same sex
*15:24.500- 15:31.400* :  marriage is illegal or not allowed in South Korea but there has been a lot of pressure over recent
*15:31.400- 15:36.320* :  years to push towards this. There have been a couple of bills introduced in parliament which
*15:36.320- 15:41.140* :  have failed to get through but what often happens in other countries in other places in Taiwan
*15:41.140- 15:48.220* :  this happened as well is that sometimes minor legal issues such as this one raises questions which
*15:48.220- 15:55.460* :  the court then resolves in favour of a same sex couple and that then leads the political leaders
*15:55.460- 16:01.960* :  to have to reassess a whole host of other legislation and perhaps to come to some agreement on
*16:01.960- 16:06.480* :  whether to allow same sex marriages. You can imagine they're going to be a whole host of people in
*16:06.480- 16:14.440* :  South Korea same sex couples lining up to challenge other legal rulings which have gone against them.
*16:14.440- 16:22.800* :  So certainly people are hailing this in South Korea as one step towards more rights for LGBT couples.
*16:22.900- 16:27.300* :  Quite a big bit of celebration going on among the LGBT community in South Korea as a result.
*16:27.700- 16:32.100* :  A lot of celebration the couple involved they couldn't believe it that the ruling came in their
*16:32.100- 16:37.440* :  favour they were very very happy about it. Mickey Bristol reporting. Still to come,
*16:37.440- 16:42.680* :  Haiti's interim prime minister announces emergency measures to combat the country's criminal gangs.
*16:50.860- 16:55.980* :  A six billion dollar con. It didn't take long for it to spread like wildfire. You got to see
*16:55.980- 17:00.680* :  go look at this really crazy gold stock buddy mine got into the dime which destroyed lives and
*17:00.680- 17:07.120* :  devastated communities. Every little town across the nation people have shares in this.
*17:07.120- 17:12.480* :  We lost everything and to date no one has been brought to justice.
*17:13.020- 17:18.920* :  Somebody knows more than we know. The six billion dollar gold scam from the BBC World Service

*17:31.800- 17:36.360* :  Today's the day Donald Trump is due to address the Republican faithful at their convention in
*17:36.360- 17:42.160* :  Mill Warkeep. It's a coronation by a party united and confident boy by Mr. Trump's survival
*17:42.160- 17:47.380* :  of the assassination attempt. Before Mr. Trump's own big moment eyes are on the former president's
*17:47.380- 17:52.860* :  choice of running mate JD Vance. The senator young new to national politics and proud of his
*17:52.860- 17:57.940* :  credentials as the son of the blue collar rust belt of Kentucky and Ohio claimed in his speech
*17:57.940- 18:03.220* :  at the convention that Trump was the last best hope for Americans. Listening was our North
*18:03.220- 18:09.380* :  America correspondent Nomiya Ikbar. My name is JD Vance from the great state of Ohio.
*18:10.760- 18:16.960* :  Just two years that's how long JD Vance has been in politics and to now be standing here giving
*18:16.960- 18:23.020* :  this speech it's quite a remarkable twist of fate and there's one expects from a VP pick.
*18:23.600- 18:27.360* :  He talked with the language of loyalty. Now prior running for president he was one of the most
*18:27.360- 18:32.680* :  successful businessmen in the world. He had everything anyone could ever want in a life
*18:33.300- 18:41.520* :  and yet instead of choosing the easy path he chose to endure abuse, slander and persecution
*18:41.580- 18:49.080* :  and he did it because he loves this country. With Donald Trump loyalty is on another level though.
*18:49.360- 18:54.600* :  Mr. Vance has backed his unsubstantiated claims of election fraud but you can't help wonder
*18:55.040- 19:00.980* :  was Mr. Vance asked in his interview with Mr. Trump will you overturn the election results if
*19:00.980- 19:06.280* :  my opponent wins. The last vice president didn't. Mike Pence isn't even at the convention.
*19:06.300- 19:13.160* :  He's now a persona non-grasa in the past. Never in my wildest imagination could I have believed
*19:13.260- 19:17.620* :  that I'd be standing here tonight. I grew up in Middletown, Ohio.
*19:22.620- 19:27.640* :  A small town where people spoke their minds, built with their hands and loved their god, their
*19:27.640- 19:33.520* :  family, their community and their country with their whole hearts. But it was also a place that had
*19:33.520- 19:38.900* :  been cast aside and forgotten by America's ruling class in Washington. The working class background
*19:38.900- 19:44.300* :  is very key for Mr. Vance. He found national fame with his memoirs about growing up in poverty in
*19:44.300- 19:50.400* :  Ohio. It was a best selling book, an Netflix movie. That appealed to Donald Trump, the showman,
*19:51.120- 19:56.680* :  but also to blue collar workers who now keep part of the Republican base under Donald Trump.
*19:57.440- 20:02.140* :  Mr. Vance also backs isolationist policies when it comes to foreign issues and
*20:02.140- 20:08.940* :  hardline positions at home. At each step of the way. In small towns like mine in Ohio or next door
*20:08.940- 20:15.340* :  in Pennsylvania or Michigan. In states all across our country, jobs were sent overseas and our
*20:15.340- 20:21.680* :  children were sent to war. But when promoting his book, JD Vance slammed Mr. Trump as a liar,
*20:22.240- 20:27.180* :  so he considered him America's Hitler. All seems to be forgiven by the former president and
*20:27.180- 20:32.460* :  lots of Republican delegates here. I forgive people every day and I hope they forgive me for some
*20:32.460- 20:39.240* :  of the dumb things I say. But the bottom line is he's on the word. He's a great guy, he's a lot of
*20:39.240- 20:45.740* :  talent. He's young, he's energetic and he wants the American first agenda. He was a never-trunker.
*20:46.180- 20:51.320* :  Now he sees the consequences of the public policy that he's enacted and he knows who he really is
*20:51.940- 20:54.760* :  and that's what JD Vance is supporting and recommending.
*20:55.160- 21:01.560* :  JD Vance says his radical U-turn is because he saw the real Donald Trump. But maybe he also
*21:01.560- 21:06.800* :  saw an opportunity. John Adams, the first ever vice president of America, famously said,
*21:06.800- 21:13.300* :  in this I'm nothing but maybe everything. Perhaps Mr. Vance sensed where Mr. Trump's voters were
*21:13.660- 21:18.500* :  and made a play for them. At 39 years he has now positioned himself to one day
*21:18.500- 21:24.700* :  be the young heir apparent of the Republican party. Thank you. God bless all of you and God bless our
*21:24.700- 21:31.500* :  great country. We heard JD Vance talk about his background. He was born in Appalachia, a region
*21:31.500- 21:37.380* :  in the East, depicted in his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy. Author and activist Nima
*21:37.380- 21:42.720* :  Vashia is also from Appalachia but she's no fan of Mr. Vance. So she's been telling my colleague
*21:42.720- 21:50.620* :  Victoria Oonhunda. He describes the people of Appalachia as members of a white working class
*21:50.620- 21:57.080* :  that is lazy, that doesn't want to work, that blames the government for their problems
*21:58.060- 22:06.280* :  and that effectively is too blame for anything that is wrong in their lives, that there's a
*22:06.280- 22:13.940* :  culture of poverty in that community and that as a result they struggle because of their choices
*22:13.940- 22:17.740* :  and their beliefs and that they need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. I think the
*22:17.740- 22:23.160* :  stereotypes that Vance executes they are embraced by people on the left and the right
*22:24.140- 22:28.320* :  because I think they make it so that no one has to be responsible for Appalachia.
*22:29.200- 22:34.940* :  When we cast this sort of single narrative and sort of single identity of Appalachia
*22:35.120- 22:42.160* :  as one group of people, we exempt people in power from responsibility for taking care of all
*22:42.160- 22:48.300* :  of the people in that region. His portrayal of the region where you come from Appalachia
*22:48.300- 22:54.540* :  seems to show a place that doesn't seem to have much diversity and yet you're telling us here
*22:54.540- 23:00.120* :  Nima that there is at least 20% of people of color. Give us a sense of what life as a non-white
*23:00.140- 23:03.700* :  person in Appalachia is like. Who was like when you were growing up?
*23:04.500- 23:08.700* :  Yeah, I'm not going to romanticize it. There were parts that were hard. I certainly experienced
*23:08.700- 23:15.280* :  discrimination and racism. Those were sort of very core parts of my growing up and also
*23:15.800- 23:20.800* :  I grew up in a neighborhood where my white working class Appalachia neighbors loved me.
*23:20.940- 23:26.880* :  They taught me how to drive. They taught my family how to garden. They showed up when my mom got
*23:26.880- 23:32.280* :  injured and made sure that she had all the support that she needed. I've never been loved
*23:33.340- 23:39.600* :  by people in the same way that I was loved in Appalachia. The way that Appalachian people
*23:39.600- 23:43.420* :  extend care, their understanding of community, it is unparalleled.
*23:43.480- 23:48.680* :  Nima of Asia talking to Victoria at 100 and don't forget you can hear all the best bits of
*23:48.680- 23:53.520* :  Donald Trump speech and our analysis of what he has to say to the Republican National Convention
*23:53.520- 23:59.540* :  in Milwaukee in later editions of the Global News Podcast. Let's catch up on events in Haiti now.
*23:59.540- 24:03.900* :  You have heard us talking before about how criminal gangs have paralyzed much of the country,
*24:04.540- 24:09.080* :  especially the capital, Porto Prince. Now, Haiti's interim prime minister, Gary Coneil,
*24:09.340- 24:14.480* :  has announced emergency measures to combat the gang's power. He's declared a state of emergency
*24:14.480- 24:20.000* :  in 14 districts. He said this would allow the government to confront those. He called bandits and
*24:20.000- 24:25.880* :  restore the authority of the state. Here's Vanessa Bushluter. Mr Coneil faces a daunting task.
*24:25.880- 24:32.380* :  An estimated 80% of the capital, Porto Prince, is under gang control. The interim prime minister
*24:32.380- 24:38.640* :  has described life there as a battle for survival. He has warned that retaking control of territory
*24:38.640- 24:45.100* :  will take time. But he promisedation police, who have now been joined by 400 Kenyan officers,
*24:45.180- 24:51.540* :  would drive out the gangs house by house, neighborhood by neighborhood. Half a million
*24:51.540- 24:56.920* :  Haitians have been displaced by the gang violence. While they will welcome the prospect of order
*24:56.920- 25:02.120* :  being restored in their neighborhoods, they will also want to see tangible results before
*25:02.120- 25:07.960* :  considering moving back. New research from Switzerland suggests the earth is getting
*25:07.960- 25:13.720* :  fatter as a result of climate change, as its girth at the equator increases and that affects
*25:13.720- 25:19.320* :  the length of days. Researchers at Zurich's ETH universities say rising sea levels
*25:19.320- 25:25.060* :  are to blame, slowing down the speed at which the earth spins. Here's Stephanie Prentiss to talk
*25:25.060- 25:29.980* :  us through the findings. Well Andrew, we do think of the earth as completely spherical, but
*25:29.980- 25:36.060* :  it's not really. It's slightly wider or fatter as this research calls it closer to the equator.
*25:36.700- 25:41.080* :  Now this study, which was based on observations as well as precise AI modeling,
*25:41.080- 25:46.700* :  it says that melting a vice at the poles in the Arctic and Antarctica, it's causing that water
*25:46.700- 25:52.560* :  to flow towards the equator, making the earth even wider there and having an impact on the speed
*25:52.560- 25:58.740* :  it can actually turn. So in simple terms, more mass at the equator, the earth turns more slowly
*25:58.740- 26:04.620* :  and the days get longer. If that is confusing for anyone, let's listen to Professor Alan Collins.
*26:04.620- 26:09.700* :  He works at the School of Physics, Chemistry and Earth Scientists at the University of Adelaide
*26:09.980- 26:13.640* :  and has his own way of explaining it. You put more mass at the equator
*26:14.140- 26:18.880* :  and it actually slows the planet down. It's like you've seen figure skaters, ice skaters,
*26:19.500- 26:23.780* :  when they're very tight and they spin around and they're very narrow and they stand up straight
*26:23.780- 26:28.300* :  they're going really fast, when they go when they sort of crouch down, they slow down. It's
*26:28.300- 26:32.260* :  exactly the same thing that's happening there. Now when people get fat around the middle,
*26:32.260- 26:37.240* :  it's bad for our health, is it bad for the earth? Well it is something various studies have
*26:37.240- 26:41.620* :  been looking into over the past decade because it is something climate scientists have been worried
*26:41.620- 26:47.020* :  about. But as it stands, the research says the increase in days is just a few milliseconds per
*26:47.020- 26:53.080* :  century. But that said, the research suggested if emission levels aren't reduced, the impact of this
*26:53.080- 26:57.460* :  could eventually end up being greater than the effect of a moon, which of course has been
*26:57.460- 27:02.220* :  determining the length of the days for billions of years. The team also pointed out that these
*27:02.560- 27:05.880* :  minor shifts have implications for things like precise timekeeping,
*27:05.880- 27:11.140* :  important for things like space navigation. But really crucially, they were keen to stress
*27:11.140- 27:17.080* :  this shows that humans have a greater impact on the planet than many perhaps realise and this
*27:17.080- 27:23.300* :  responsibility really needs to be taken more seriously. Stephanie Prentice, the Paris Olympics are
*27:23.300- 27:28.160* :  just eight days away, athletes around the world are making their final preparations to represent
*27:28.160- 27:33.020* :  their country. That's something that's not always possible though, the Olympic refugee team was first
*27:33.020- 27:39.160* :  set up by the International Olympic Committee for the Rio Games in 2016. It represents the 100 million
*27:39.160- 27:45.080* :  displaced people worldwide. Sarah Dawkins has been talking to just one of the 36 athletes selected
*27:45.080- 27:55.240* :  to compete in Paris. Here at the National Badminton Centre in Milton Keynes, great Britain's
*27:55.240- 28:00.420* :  athletes are fine-tuning their serves and smashes before competing on the world's biggest stage.
*28:01.360- 28:06.060* :  But there is an athlete here today who will be representing a different team, the Olympic refugee
*28:06.060- 28:13.500* :  team. I am Dorosa Yarevapa, I am from Iran and I am part of the refugee on an victim. I came
*28:13.500- 28:20.640* :  in the UK about four years ago. The reason I left Iran is because of my mom's problems and issues
*28:20.640- 28:28.220* :  in Iran and because of that we had to leave because it wasn't safe for us. I had to leave my family,
*28:28.220- 28:34.960* :  my friends, my badminton team and technically everyone I knew to start a new life.
*28:36.360- 28:42.100* :  I did not speak any English, I learned English by myself in the UK by watching Netflix actually.
*28:42.960- 28:48.560* :  Since its creation in 2016, the team has grown from 10 to 36 athletes.
*28:49.200- 28:55.380* :  Dorosa will compete in Paris alongside athletes from Syria, Cuba, Ethiopia and many other nations,
*28:55.420- 29:01.060* :  all of whom have been forced to flee their home. But who are embracing the opportunity to compete
*29:01.060- 29:07.320* :  together in the sports they love. My dad introduced me to Badminton, I immediately fell in love with it.
*29:07.640- 29:14.920* :  It's the great community, great people that you meet from all over the world and it's just such a
*29:14.920- 29:21.140* :  great sport to bring people together. My dad wasn't allowed to watch me play in Iran as it's a
*29:21.140- 29:28.300* :  ruling Iran to not allow men to watch women play. Dorosa didn't see her dad for years until he
*29:28.300- 29:33.460* :  joined her in England last year, sport eventually bringing them back together. When my dad
*29:33.460- 29:40.440* :  watched me play for the first time in 19 years and after the game we started hugging each other,
*29:40.440- 29:43.980* :  he said I'm really proud of you and that made me feel amazing.
*29:44.460- 29:51.720* :  I don't think it was always my goal to play, always and now achieving it is just such an
*29:52.040- 29:58.360* :  unreal opportunity and I'm like I still don't believe it. I'm so excited to see the
*29:58.360- 30:00.880* :  Eiffel Tower, I'm just excited for everything.
*30:01.900- 30:07.180* :  For Dorosa, who wears an Olympic ring's necklace, the chance to compete in Paris means more than
*30:07.180- 30:14.100* :  just sport. I think my story will say that no refugee is alone and we're all normal people,
*30:15.320- 30:23.180* :  we should be treated how normal people is being treated and we are human. My long-term goal
*30:23.180- 30:33.700* :  for all of this is keep the track on Olympics and also to hopefully join the Great Britain's team
*30:33.700- 30:40.960* :  which it would be amazing for me to do that and to just keep this going and make this my career.
*30:45.520- 30:48.840* :  That's all from us for now, there will be a new edition of Global News to download later.
