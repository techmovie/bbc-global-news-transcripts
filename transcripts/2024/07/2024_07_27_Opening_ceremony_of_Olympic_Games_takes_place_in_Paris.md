*01:28.440- 01:33.560* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in the early hours of Saturday, the 27th of July, these are our main
*01:33.560- 01:40.280* :  stories. The Olympic flag has been raised in central Paris during a spectacular rain-soaked
*01:40.280- 01:46.720* :  opening ceremony for the 2024 Games in the French capital. A flattilla of boats transported
*01:46.720- 01:52.420* :  the athletes down the river Senn, watched by an audience of hundreds of thousands on the city's
*01:52.420- 01:59.060* :  keys and bridges. In other news, Mexico is demanding a full report from Washington about the arrest
*01:59.060- 02:08.440* :  of two notorious drugs lords. Also in this podcast, a vast blanket peat bog achieves UNESCO world
*02:08.440- 02:15.360* :  heritage status. The ecosystem supports a huge range of rare plants, insects, birds and animals.
*02:19.920- 02:27.260* :  We begin in France. The 2024 Olympic Games in the French capital, Paris, have opened with a stunning
*02:27.260- 02:33.200* :  display of French culture, architecture and heritage, and the pageantry of the world's top athletes
*02:33.200- 02:38.600* :  sailing down the river Senn on boats, a procession lined by fireworks and water jets.
*02:39.340- 02:45.140* :  In the initial stages, musicians, including Lady Gaga and Aya Nakamura, performed alongside
*02:45.140- 02:52.000* :  teams of dancers, high-kicking the can-can, or perching perilously on poles. Others danced on
*02:52.000- 02:57.260* :  the roofs of nearby buildings, hundreds of thousands of people were on the river's bridges and keys.
*02:57.680- 03:03.180* :  The ceremony was closed by Celine Dion singing on the Eiffel Tower. These people were in the crowd.
*03:06.680- 03:13.480* :  It's been my dream to be here since I was a child. I am having so much fun. There is no way
*03:13.480- 03:19.340* :  to describe this. I'm really nervous because this is what I've been waiting for all my life.
*03:19.960- 03:25.160* :  I feel excited. I'm so happy that I can be here in Paris and I can watch the Olympics and
*03:25.160- 03:31.940* :  help the tourists start coming. Team USA, I love all sports. We're going to the soccer game in
*03:31.940- 03:37.560* :  a rugby match, but Team USA and I'm really looking forward to Lebron Day and Coco walking and
*03:37.560- 03:44.800* :  carrying the American flag. But not everyone was happy. The sound system doesn't work,
*03:44.800- 03:50.120* :  it's poorly orientated and we can't hear anything. The screens are so small, it's catastrophic,
*03:50.780- 03:55.720* :  and we can't see the same and we can't watch the monitors. We're in the sand and we can't sit.
*03:55.820- 04:04.460* :  Plan B will go to a bar instead or go home. Our reporter, David Chazan, who is in Paris,
*04:04.460- 04:09.680* :  summed up the event. I'm sorry to have to report that it rained on the parade along the
*04:09.740- 04:16.620* :  sand and it didn't ruin things, but some VIPs left the stands specially built along the river
*04:16.620- 04:23.940* :  banks a bit earlier than planned to seek shelter and it probably looked better on television than
*04:23.940- 04:31.420* :  it felt under the driving rain. But there was still a carnival atmosphere and some electrifying
*04:31.420- 04:39.880* :  performances. Lady Gaga sang in French and I can vouch for her accent, very impressive. Acrobat
*04:39.880- 04:46.760* :  danced on the scaffolding at Notre Dame Cathedral whose reconstruction is now nearly complete after
*04:46.760- 04:53.900* :  the devastating fire. There was a ballet sequence on a rooftop, another with the Olympic torch
*04:53.900- 05:01.720* :  spirited away across rooftops by a figure in an Napoleon era military costume and there was
*05:01.720- 05:09.880* :  a memorable image of a metallic horse with a caped rider galloping down river mounted of course
*05:09.880- 05:16.940* :  on a barge and then we saw a real rider on dry land arriving with the Olympic flag for the
*05:16.940- 05:23.480* :  clothes of the ceremony. The flag was hoisted while the Olympic anthem rang out, it was
*05:23.960- 05:32.920* :  nothing if not spectacular. And the Marseilles, the French national anthem, was sung by a 28-year-old
*05:32.920- 05:40.740* :  opera singer Axel Sasse-SÃ©relle from the French Caribbean territory of Guadeloupe with President
*05:40.740- 05:48.740* :  Macron and other dignitaries standing to attention. And the Marlion-born French are in Beestar,
*05:48.740- 05:57.260* :  Ayen Nakamura performed a Charles Asnabour song in a gold costume with the French republican guard
*05:57.260- 06:06.400* :  marching alongside with their drums and far-right leaders had objected to Nakamura's role,
*06:06.400- 06:13.380* :  saying it would, in their words, humiliate France. But the organizers and the master of ceremonies,
*06:13.380- 06:20.920* :  the theatre director Tomas Jolie, were determined to celebrate the diversity of modern France
*06:20.960- 06:28.020* :  alongside its rich history and cultural heritage. And in another strong symbol, given the Gaza
*06:28.020- 06:35.900* :  conflict, delegations from both Israel and Palestine took part separately in the water-borne
*06:35.900- 06:43.540* :  procession along the river. So did it live up to expectations? Was the reaction been like
*06:43.540- 06:51.220* :  so far in France? Because as you say, it was designed for a TV audience, so would spectators
*06:51.220- 06:56.700* :  have really been aware of what was going on in all the different places? How did it work?
*06:57.340- 07:03.580* :  Well, probably a bit less well than the television audience estimated, by the way, at one billion
*07:03.580- 07:12.240* :  across the world. But there were a whole series of giant screens set up, so the bits that they
*07:12.240- 07:21.220* :  couldn't see, they could watch on those giant screens. So I think they got a pretty good sense of
*07:21.220- 07:27.900* :  what was going on, particularly seeing all those national delegations going past in the boat.
*07:27.900- 07:33.560* :  That was David Chazan in Paris. Well, of course, a lot of the people who wanted to witness the
*07:33.560- 07:40.140* :  events in Paris on Friday had their plans scuppered by a coordinated sabotage attack on the French
*07:40.140- 07:46.740* :  high-speed rail network. A series of arson attacks affected around 800,000 passengers,
*07:46.740- 07:51.700* :  and it's expected to continue over the next few days. The new French Prime Minister Gabriela
*07:51.700- 08:00.700* :  Tal has urged people to be vigilant. The investigation has begun. I call on everyone to be
*08:00.700- 08:06.140* :  cautious. What we know, what we can see, is that this operation was prepared, coordinated,
*08:06.220- 08:11.340* :  that nerve centers were targeted, which shows a form of knowledge of the network in order to
*08:11.580- 08:19.340* :  strike. The French intelligence services are leading the investigation. The security plan in
*08:19.340- 08:25.060* :  Paris was already intense as the city is facing a series of threats, either against athletes from
*08:25.060- 08:30.180* :  particular countries or the Olympics as a whole. But the president of the International Olympic
*08:30.180- 08:36.000* :  Committee, Thomas Bach, says he's confident about security. All the measures are being taken,
*08:36.880- 08:46.600* :  and the French authorities are assisted by 180 other intelligence services around the world,
*08:47.540- 08:53.180* :  and not only by information, some of them are even deploying their human resources,
*08:53.180- 09:00.280* :  and so we have good reasons to have full confidence. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner gave
*09:00.280- 09:06.200* :  his assessment. I think we can't rule out the possibility of somebody having inside a knowledge,
*09:06.200- 09:11.080* :  somebody who worked for the railways or had worked as a contractor for the railways because they
*09:11.080- 09:18.120* :  knew exactly what to do to cause maximum disruption, but no casualties. So ever since these
*09:18.120- 09:22.300* :  attacks were first reported in the early hours of the morning, overnight, French intelligence
*09:22.300- 09:27.540* :  would have been working together with the police and the railway company to try and work out who
*09:27.540- 09:31.880* :  could have done this, who had been seen in the vicinity. Were there any fingerprints? Is there
*09:31.880- 09:37.100* :  any forensic evidence can be gathered from the scene? Now, interestingly, some people are
*09:37.100- 09:43.980* :  pointing out that there is a similarity here to an earlier arson attack that took place in September
*09:43.980- 09:49.920* :  last year in Northern Germany, and that was claimed by a far left website. Now, that doesn't
*09:49.920- 09:56.340* :  mean that it was a far left group this time, but far left and far right activists, extremists,
*09:56.400- 10:01.060* :  will be under the microscope, I think, for this one. We shouldn't also forget that back in
*10:01.060- 10:06.860* :  April, President Macron said he had no doubt whatsoever that leaders in Russia in Moscow
*10:07.440- 10:12.580* :  would be looking to disrupt and damage the Olympic Games. This is in retaliation for France's
*10:12.580- 10:19.680* :  support of Ukraine as it tries to repel the Russian invasion. And two months ago, coffins were
*10:20.140- 10:24.800* :  left at the base of the Eiffel Tower, dripped in French flags, saying French soldiers in Ukraine.
*10:24.800- 10:29.320* :  They're really working on a bit of a blank sheet with this, but as I say, the fact that it
*10:29.320- 10:35.060* :  doesn't appear to be terrorism, unless it's some very clever diversionary tactic to try and
*10:35.680- 10:39.600* :  draw attention away from somewhere else, but nothing is going to change the fact that there is
*10:39.600- 10:45.120* :  going to be intent security right now. In Paris, I think the French authorities are going to be
*10:45.120- 10:50.120* :  holding their breath until the whole of these Olympic Games are over. That was Frank Gardner.
*10:50.560- 10:56.320* :  Well, with the opening ceremony now ended, there is a tight schedule to fit in more than 10,000
*10:56.320- 11:02.380* :  athletes competing across 32 Olympic sports. In fact, just to squeeze it all in, some events have
*11:02.380- 11:08.500* :  already started, including football, rugby sevens, handball and archery. Lee James from BBC
*11:08.500- 11:13.240* :  Sportsworld talked us through the action to come. Lots to look forward to Jackie Real,
*11:13.240- 11:18.580* :  sense of anticipation here in Paris for those games, which, as you say, did begin on Wednesday,
*11:18.580- 11:24.360* :  rugby sevens is one of those that a number of people here are looking forward to, because there's
*11:24.360- 11:29.780* :  a real hope that France can deliver one of their gold medals. They're targeting. They're already
*11:29.780- 11:36.560* :  through to the semi-final stages. Anton Dupont is the face of these Paris Olympics, and he's the
*11:36.560- 11:42.320* :  mega star from the 15 aside ranks. The captain of his country voted well, player of the year in 2021.
*11:42.460- 11:47.920* :  He switched to the sevens. He missed the six nations to focus on a bid for Olympic glory,
*11:47.920- 11:52.520* :  and he's got the crowd at the stud, the France, where the rugby sevens is played, really
*11:52.520- 11:56.100* :  overwhelmed with how they've been performing. They've got a semi-final to come on Saturday
*11:56.100- 12:01.740* :  against South Africa, and then all the action begins on the opening day. The first gold medal
*12:02.120- 12:06.980* :  will be in the shooting, the mixed team air rifle event, which is at Shatteru, which is some two
*12:06.980- 12:11.940* :  and a half hours away from Paris by train. But the swimming is perhaps Jackie Real, the real
*12:11.940- 12:16.300* :  highlight for Saturday, La Daphense, Serena is where we're going to see the seven-time Olympic
*12:16.300- 12:20.900* :  champion, Katie Ladecki, who's one gold medal away from becoming the most successful female
*12:20.900- 12:27.120* :  Olympic swimmer of all time. But a great rivalry with Australia's Ariane Titmus and Summer Macintosh
*12:27.240- 12:32.520* :  of Canada in the 400 metre freestyle, one of the really standout events from the first week
*12:32.520- 12:35.680* :  of the swimming programme. And tell us about the new event we can look forward to.
*12:36.100- 12:43.040* :  Yes, we've got one new event this time around, and it is the sport of breaking. It's emerged from
*12:43.040- 12:49.140* :  the breakdancing scene, the Bronx in New York in the 1970s. Now a fully fledged sport,
*12:49.140- 12:54.320* :  making its debut here with 16 men and 16 women taking part in the competition. It gets
*12:54.320- 12:59.660* :  underway towards the end, though, of these Olympic games. That's the brand new sport. There are
*12:59.880- 13:04.640* :  some innovations, though, for some of the sports that we're going to be seeing over these games,
*13:04.640- 13:09.880* :  like kayak cross, which is making its debut. It's a form of canoe slalom, but with four athletes
*13:09.880- 13:15.240* :  racing against each other. And there's gender parity at these Olympic games. For the first time
*13:15.240- 13:22.340* :  in Olympic history, so artistic swimming for men is debuting at these games, an equal number of
*13:22.340- 13:25.900* :  male and female competitors across all the medal events at these games.
*13:26.460- 13:30.200* :  Lee James in Paris. Now to other news, the president of Mexico,
*13:30.200- 13:35.920* :  AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, has galled for a complete and transparent investigation
*13:36.540- 13:42.200* :  into the arrest of two of Mexico's biggest drug traffickers accused of smuggling huge amounts
*13:42.200- 13:50.580* :  of heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl into the U.S. Ismail El Mayo-Sambada is the co-founder of Mexico's
*13:50.580- 13:56.460* :  notorious Cinelloa Cartel. A lawyer for Mr. Sambada said he'd appeared in court where he pleaded
*13:56.460- 14:02.840* :  not guilty. He was detained on Thursday, along with JoaquÃ­n GuismÃ¡n LÃ³pez, the son of another
*14:02.840- 14:08.200* :  co-founder known as El Chapo, who is himself serving a life sentence in the United States.
*14:09.000- 14:12.460* :  The U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland welcomed the news.
*14:12.980- 14:19.480* :  El Mayo and GuismÃ¡n LÃ³pez join a growing list of Cinelloa Cartel leaders and associates
*14:20.080- 14:23.640* :  who the Justice Department is holding accountable in the United States.
*14:24.580- 14:31.580* :  fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced. The Justice Department will not
*14:31.580- 14:39.540* :  rest until every single Cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities
*14:39.660- 14:46.540* :  is held accountable. Daniel Pardo from BBC Mundo has been following this story and he told us more
*14:46.540- 14:52.240* :  about President Obrador's reaction. He celebrated the actual fact that El Mayo was arrested,
*14:52.480- 14:58.340* :  but he did give a few nuances on the happening in the sense that there is some speculation
*14:58.340- 15:05.240* :  on the fact that he might have been surrendered and the Mexican authorities have not been clarified
*15:05.240- 15:14.020* :  about this. That does have implications because of the information that El Mayo might give the U.S.
*15:14.020- 15:20.040* :  authorities about the Mexican authorities. Do bear in mind that El Mayo was a leader of the Cartel
*15:20.040- 15:26.300* :  Cinelloa who was in charge of the connections and links and relationships with the authorities,
*15:26.300- 15:32.500* :  with the police, with the political system. So this is a person who has a lot of information
*15:32.500- 15:38.140* :  and this is going to have a lot of implications on what was the means, what was the context
*15:38.140- 15:45.840* :  of his either surrenders or his arrest. And now the president wants a report from the U.S.
*15:45.840- 15:52.700* :  doesn't he? Yeah, of course he hasn't had one. He got informed about this as we did through
*15:52.700- 15:58.440* :  the media. He wasn't informed of the fact that they were a couple of hours before the United States
*15:58.960- 16:04.880* :  authority. So yeah, this does have implications and obviously this is something that determines
*16:04.880- 16:10.900* :  the relationship, the two countries that have all sorts of things together and with the elections
*16:10.900- 16:16.760* :  coming and he knows that this has an implication for the Democrat party in the sense that this is
*16:16.760- 16:22.640* :  something that they were going to boast about in the campaign. So yeah, it has a lot of
*16:22.640- 16:28.320* :  political implications really. And what do we know about the actual arrests of these two men?
*16:29.240- 16:35.620* :  So they were going, they thought they were going to the south of Mexico looking to check on these
*16:36.000- 16:43.000* :  clandestine land fields but the person who was in charge of that operation, an associate of El
*16:43.000- 16:50.940* :  Majo, was talking to the U.S. authorities and took the plane all the way to Texas and when they
*16:50.940- 16:56.460* :  got there they found out that there would be arrested. So a person and this is very important to
*16:56.460- 17:03.440* :  note about his profile. This is a guy of 76 years old who was able to dodge the authorities for
*17:03.440- 17:10.540* :  his whole four decades of drug dealing career and at the end he got busted because he was fooled.
*17:11.580- 17:17.420* :  Daniel Pardo. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met the former president and
*17:17.420- 17:23.380* :  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in Florida. The tone was said to be warmer than
*17:23.380- 17:30.080* :  when Mr. Netanyahu met Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris on Thursday, after which she
*17:30.080- 17:36.060* :  said she couldn't stay silent about the suffering of civilians in Gaza. The Israeli leader didn't
*17:36.060- 17:41.860* :  give details of that meeting but said Israel would be dispatching a negotiating team to the
*17:41.860- 17:48.200* :  Gaza cease-fire talks in Rome next week. This was the first time that Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu
*17:48.200- 17:53.900* :  have met in nearly four years. When Donald Trump was the U.S. President the two men had a close
*17:53.900- 18:00.520* :  relationship with Mr. Trump exceeding to an Israeli request to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv
*18:00.520- 18:05.980* :  to Jerusalem. Elizabeth Pipco is the spokesperson for the Republican National Committee.
*18:06.660- 18:11.700* :  Julian Marshall asked her if the two men had resolved some of the differences they had.
*18:12.780- 18:17.560* :  I guess we could say that. Look, I was told they had a very good meeting, discussed countless
*18:17.560- 18:22.900* :  issues. I was told baby Netanyahu thanked the former president for his administration's work
*18:22.920- 18:26.740* :  to build stability in the region and promote peace throughout the Middle East and the world.
*18:26.740- 18:30.900* :  So I don't know if they've resolved everything but I'm told that they had a very, very good
*18:30.900- 18:38.380* :  productive meeting. So what could Israel expect from a Trump presidency? Honestly, I mean,
*18:38.380- 18:43.220* :  I'm asked this all the time and I think it's interesting that people continue to kind of have
*18:43.220- 18:47.700* :  these questions after the four years that we saw with Donald Trump in office. Donald Trump was
*18:47.700- 18:53.300* :  very, very committed to the alliance between Israel and the United States. It was very loyal to
*18:53.300- 18:59.280* :  Israel. You mentioned moving the embassy. He also obviously had the Abraham Accords ending the
*18:59.280- 19:02.960* :  Iran nuclear deal. Like he said that he would recognize it is really sovereign to be over the
*19:02.960- 19:07.540* :  go on heights. I think the Taylor force act was incredible as well. There were plenty of things
*19:07.540- 19:12.500* :  put into place by Donald Trump when it comes to the security and safety of the state of Israel
*19:12.500- 19:17.960* :  and our alliance with them. So I think people can expect that to continue on the exact same way
*19:17.960- 19:23.760* :  when he's back in office. But when Mr. Trump was last president, there wasn't a war in Gaza. I mean,
*19:23.760- 19:29.680* :  that has changed. Has it not the US sort of relationship with Israel?
*19:29.920- 19:35.300* :  You know, for me as someone who puts my identity as a Jewish American before anything else,
*19:35.380- 19:40.020* :  I look to the relationship as something that is incredibly strong. I think that that might be
*19:40.020- 19:44.180* :  rocky right now. I think the relationship Israel has with a lot of the world is rocky right now.
*19:44.180- 19:49.360* :  But I think a war, if anything, should strengthen our relationship with allies like Israel, right?
*19:49.420- 19:53.780* :  For us, especially knowing that Hamas right now, who's obviously at war with Israel, is also
*19:53.780- 19:58.260* :  holding our own Americans hostage right now. If anything, that should strengthen our relationship.
*19:58.260- 20:02.520* :  It should not change the values that we hold dear that we share with the state of Israel.
*20:02.980- 20:06.520* :  And I think if anything, it's strengthings everything that Donald Trump tried to put into place
*20:06.520- 20:11.660* :  back when he was in office. And his duty as he puts it to continue that relationship. So no,
*20:11.660- 20:15.940* :  I don't think it changes anything. If anything, the circumstances have only proven how important
*20:15.940- 20:20.100* :  the relationship between the two countries actually is. That was Elizabeth Pipco,
*20:20.100- 20:27.440* :  spokesperson for the Republican National Committee. Still to come. Some of our lexicographers
*20:27.440- 20:34.300* :  are looking out for new words and they will record them, suggest and put them forward for inclusion
*20:34.300- 20:39.420* :  in the dictionary. So do we merit a chef's kiss or do we give you the ik?

*21:52.420- 21:57.880* :  Let's go to Bangladesh now. The country has been gripped by deadly violence as what started as
*21:57.880- 22:04.220* :  peaceful protests against government job quotas escalated international-wide unrest. More than
*22:04.220- 22:11.400* :  4,000 people have been arrested and around 200 have been killed. Now, staff at a hospital in DACA
*22:11.740- 22:16.900* :  say three student leaders who have been treated there for their injuries have been taken away
*22:16.900- 22:22.460* :  by plainclothes policemen at Bahassein of the BBC Bengali Service told us more.
*22:23.220- 22:29.320* :  Three students leaders, they were basically leading the student protest and they were admitted
*22:29.320- 22:37.220* :  in a local hospital in DACA. But at around 4 p.m. in the local time, around 8 to 10 plainclothes,
*22:37.400- 22:43.300* :  members of the security forces, they went to the hospital and they asked the student leaders to
*22:43.660- 22:50.220* :  come with them. And when they refused to do so because they were admitting their previous injury,
*22:50.220- 22:57.520* :  the security forces forced them into a car. Now, we do not know about their whereabouts.
*22:57.820- 23:04.200* :  I have spoken to some senior police officers in DACA, but they say that they didn't arrest anyone
*23:04.200- 23:09.800* :  from any hospital. But I think this is a very strange thing in Bangladesh that because the criminal
*23:09.800- 23:16.780* :  justice system, it is sort of dysfunctional in the country because when police are plainclothes
*23:16.780- 23:24.220* :  security forces, anyone, usually they do not admit immediately. According to the law,
*23:24.800- 23:30.020* :  the person who is arrested, he or she must be produced before the court within 24 hours.
*23:30.640- 23:33.640* :  But police are security forces, they do not follow that procedure.
*23:34.480- 23:40.460* :  And yes, just take a step back and remind us what it is that these weeks of protests have been
*23:40.460- 23:47.300* :  about. So we have never seen such a huge protest in Bangladesh. And these protests initially
*23:47.300- 23:53.260* :  started very peacefully and that demand was to abolish the controversial quota system in the
*23:53.260- 24:00.900* :  country's civil service because there were 55 percent job reserved for independence fighters,
*24:00.900- 24:07.600* :  families, women, ethnic minorities, and different disadvantaged groups. The quota system is very
*24:07.600- 24:11.540* :  unpopular in Bangladesh. And the protesters, they were saying that Bangladesh is the country of
*24:11.540- 24:19.500* :  170 million population used desperately looking for jobs. So this is absolutely unjustified to have
*24:19.500- 24:25.140* :  huge number of quotas in the civil service. That's why they started protesting on the streets.
*24:25.820- 24:31.780* :  And Pa has saying in Bangladesh, now you might have watched or heard the latest harrowing BBC
*24:31.780- 24:37.820* :  Africa eye documentary this week called the apartheid killer. Its subject was a man called
*24:37.820- 24:43.700* :  Louis Funscore, thought to be one of South Africa's most prolific ever mass murderers.
*24:44.060- 24:49.540* :  On Friday, we learnt that he himself has died. Our African regional editor, Nick Erickson,
*24:49.540- 24:56.060* :  told us more about him. That extraordinary Africa eye documentary you mentioned came out on Monday.
*24:56.060- 25:02.680* :  It's well worth the watch or a listen or a read. During the dying years of apartheid, so that's
*25:02.700- 25:09.220* :  between 1986 and 1989, roughly, Funscore worked as a private security guard in the city of East
*25:09.580- 25:16.520* :  London. And during that time, he is believed to have shot and killed at least 39 people. They're
*25:16.700- 25:23.060* :  all them black. The youngest victim being just 12 years of age. Now the BBC Africa eye team
*25:23.060- 25:29.780* :  travelled to South Africa recently to meet him. They found a man, Funscore, who almost 40 years on,
*25:29.780- 25:35.660* :  actually believed that all his victims were criminals who had been caught red-handed. And he
*25:35.660- 25:42.320* :  believed that he bore absolutely no guilt or no remorse for their deaths. Under apartheid law,
*25:42.320- 25:49.040* :  people were able to use lethal force against intruders. And so in most cases, in 32 of the cases,
*25:49.040- 25:55.540* :  in fact, involving Funscore, his killings were classified by the police as justified homicide,
*25:55.540- 25:59.580* :  which is essentially what they remained to this day. But he did go to jail.
*26:00.260- 26:06.300* :  Yes, indeed. He was arrested in 1991. Historically, this was just a South Africa was coming out of
*26:06.460- 26:11.840* :  the horrors of white minority rule and moving to democracy. And eventually, he was convicted.
*26:12.460- 26:17.300* :  But he was only convicted on seven charges of murder, those not considered what I call justified
*26:17.300- 26:22.540* :  homicides, what I refer to as justified homicides. And he served only 12 years in prison.
*26:23.320- 26:28.960* :  Now, the Africa I documentary mentioned, I mentioned, raised serious concerns and serious
*26:28.960- 26:33.460* :  questions about these so-called justified shootings. They had long interviews with Funscore
*26:33.460- 26:38.140* :  himself, but also with the families of his victims, who've had to wait a very long time for
*26:38.140- 26:45.620* :  some kind of justice. Nick Erickson. The flow country in the far north of Scotland is one of the
*26:45.620- 26:51.840* :  world's most outstanding examples of what's known as a blanket bog. Basically, waterlogged peat.
*26:52.180- 26:58.300* :  It covers more than 3,000 square kilometers. That's 1200 square miles. And now, after a 40-year
*26:58.300- 27:04.580* :  campaign, it's been given the Rare Award of World Heritage Status. Our climate editor, Justin
*27:04.580- 27:10.600* :  Rolatt, has spent most of the week there. A giant Scottish bog may seem an unlikely place to be
*27:10.600- 27:18.140* :  garlanded with world heritage status, but the flow country is truly extraordinary. This epic landscape
*27:18.140- 27:25.280* :  is a seemingly endless expanse of peat bog, edged by dark mountains, and dotted with shining
*27:25.280- 27:32.360* :  pools. UNESCO, the UN body that makes these awards, declared it an outstanding example of a blanket
*27:32.360- 27:40.320* :  bog. The ecosystem supports a huge range of rare plants, insects, birds and animals. The carnivorous
*27:40.320- 27:47.240* :  sunju plants that lure in their insect prey with dots of shimmering sticky mucus are particularly
*27:47.240- 27:52.800* :  eye catching. And after four decades of campaigning, it's no surprise that those involved with the
*27:52.800- 27:59.760* :  bid are delighted. Kenneth Chisholm is from RSPB Scotland, which manages a large reserve in the
*27:59.760- 28:06.600* :  flow country. For the peatlands, it recognizes the importance of them in that global scale. I mean,
*28:06.600- 28:11.400* :  this is the first peatland that has been recognized as a world heritage site. So it raises the
*28:11.400- 28:16.680* :  significance of peatlands on the global scene. In terms of the peatlands of the flow country,
*28:16.680- 28:21.980* :  obviously, it helps protect those as an amazing place for wildlife. And if you're wondering why the
*28:21.980- 28:28.060* :  BBC's climate editor has spent this week in the heart of this magnificent bog, it is because
*28:28.060- 28:34.840* :  it is also an important bullwalk against climate change. Peak deposits have been building up at a
*28:34.840- 28:40.380* :  rate of roughly a millimeter a year here, ever since the vast ice sheets that covered most of the
*28:40.380- 28:48.020* :  UK began to melt away some 10,000 years ago. The peat is as much as 10 meters deep in places.
*28:48.420- 28:53.500* :  And because the plant material in peat soils hasn't fully rotted away, they are a huge
*28:53.500- 29:00.100* :  store of carbon. It has been estimated the entire system could contain as much as 400
*29:00.100- 29:05.800* :  million tonnes of the stuff, which is reckoned to be twice that contained in all of Britain's
*29:05.800- 29:12.520* :  woodlands. Another reason why the flow country is a worthy winner of world heritage status.
*29:13.220- 29:20.000* :  That was just in Rolatt in northern Scotland. The English language is constantly evolving and
*29:20.000- 29:26.140* :  among the more than 3,000 words and phrases to have made it into the Cambridge Dictionary this year are
*29:26.140- 29:32.840* :  chef's kiss, boop and the ik, which dating coach Matthew Hussie explained last month to the BBC.
*29:33.700- 29:41.320* :  The ik is the overwhelming feeling of repulsion that you feel when someone does something or
*29:41.460- 29:47.780* :  stead something or has a mannerism or something about them a moment where you suddenly become incredibly
*29:47.780- 29:54.480* :  turned off and it feels like there's no return. Okay, so let's take another word, another term
*29:54.480- 30:00.660* :  chef's kiss. What does that mean? Julian Marshall heard more from Colin McIntosh, the Cambridge
*30:00.660- 30:07.360* :  Dictionary's programme manager. It's that gesture is so well known and is not new, it's been around
*30:07.360- 30:11.820* :  as far as I can remember. When you put your fingers to your mouth, you kiss your fingers and open
*30:11.820- 30:17.600* :  up and there's a little explosion of wow, this is perfect. But it's only recently I think that
*30:17.600- 30:23.640* :  it's actually got a name and I think that is due to things like social media, which show it
*30:23.900- 30:31.240* :  and then people are trying to describe that maybe in a post or text. So trying to put it into writing.
*30:32.320- 30:41.140* :  One that slightly puzzled me was i, y, k, y, k. I mean I couldn't possibly pronounce that,
*30:41.140- 30:46.380* :  can you pronounce it? Well, I suppose it's not really meant to be pronounced because it is
*30:47.040- 30:54.060* :  from social media posts or text speech. But you know, it's like FYI, you would say FYI, if you
*30:54.060- 31:00.980* :  wanted to, put it into into speech. So i, y, k, y, k, or you just say, if you know, you know.
*31:02.100- 31:07.340* :  So that's what sharing knowledge or a private joke that others might have to decide or information.
*31:07.380- 31:14.740* :  Yes, a private joke, exactly. There are more than 3,000 of these new words and phrases.
*31:15.300- 31:21.260* :  How do you decide what makes it in? Well, we have a reading program, first of all. So some of our
*31:21.260- 31:27.980* :  lexicographers are looking out for new words and they will record them, suggest them, put them
*31:27.980- 31:34.080* :  forward for inclusion in the dictionary and we do our research. So we are looking to see how
*31:34.080- 31:39.220* :  frequently they're being used. How long it's been in use? If we think they're going to stick around,
*31:39.420- 31:45.860* :  we don't want to add stuff that's too ephemeral. I mean, how do you decide on that whether or not it
*31:45.860- 31:52.100* :  is ephemeral? Whether it's a popular phrase or word this year and might disappear next year?
*31:52.340- 31:57.400* :  We're recording really for posterity in a way. We're documenting what people are saying. So we are
*31:57.400- 32:04.040* :  not too exclusive. We, we do like to add the things that people are saying as long as it's not
*32:04.040- 32:10.840* :  just a one or four or a flash in the pan. So we're analysing it and if we find enough evidence,
*32:10.840- 32:16.520* :  then they will go into the dictionary. Cambridge Dictionary's programme manager Colin McIntosh.
*32:16.920- 32:22.940* :  Now let's return to our main story in France. The opening ceremony of the 2024 Olympic Games has
*32:22.940- 32:30.700* :  taken place in Paris and around 16,000 kilometres away in Tahiti, the centre of French Polynesia.
*32:31.120- 32:36.920* :  The Olympic surfers wait for the wave to come. The wave called Choupeau. Waiting with the
*32:36.920- 32:44.140* :  surfers for the 10 metre high barrel wave will be Ben Toire, a photographer who specialises in
*32:44.140- 32:49.660* :  capturing the moment surfers catch a wave. Johnny Diamond asked him for more on the Olympic
*32:49.660- 32:53.220* :  surfing event there and also to explain little about what he does.
*33:00.200- 33:05.940* :  So my specialty is water photography so I love to be in the element with my camera
*33:06.600- 33:12.680* :  in a water housing and I'm swimming. So I just have my camera and a pair of fins and I'm just
*33:12.680- 33:19.680* :  navigating into these waters, finding the right spot to capture the right moment of the surfer.
*33:19.880- 33:28.580* :  So I'm trying to be in the barrel with the surfer. And what is it that makes the perfect photo for
*33:28.580- 33:38.420* :  you? What combination of water and light and surfer? I think in the end what really drives me
*33:38.860- 33:45.600* :  until today to take this photograph is the emotion that is transmitting through these photos.
*33:46.120- 33:53.040* :  That specific moment of the surfer being one with nature, being in that barrel, in that
*33:53.040- 33:57.440* :  beautiful environment, the light heating, the water. There's something magic about water
*33:57.440- 34:07.840* :  photography. Is there a sense of balance between the surfer and the curl of the wave all around him or
*34:07.840- 34:16.320* :  her? Or is it more of a competition between the person and the water that surrounds him or her?
*34:16.620- 34:24.600* :  I think surfing is all about balance and I think the pure art of surfing is to be one with the ocean.
*34:24.940- 34:30.240* :  Chopo is such a perfect wave that once you're in the spot you just hold your line and you enjoy the
*34:30.240- 34:38.180* :  voyage, the barrel. When you are observing the wave, when you are trying to capture it and when
*34:38.180- 34:46.120* :  the surfer is trying to ride inside the barrel, is there a sense of jeopardy? Is there a sense of
*34:46.380- 34:53.420* :  danger with all this crashing water all around you and them? Chopo is one of the heaviest waves in
*34:53.420- 34:59.240* :  the world for sure and breaks above very shallow water, above the reef. So there's always
*35:00.180- 35:06.000* :  humility in surfing because you're facing extreme power. You've been doing this a while,
*35:06.120- 35:15.780* :  but now the Olympics are upon you. Is it a big deal that this global competition has come to
*35:15.780- 35:23.960* :  and that the competition for gold starts now? Absolutely. I know this little piece of
*35:23.960- 35:32.120* :  reef quite well now. It's really an honor to me, I think, to be able to capture this very specific
*35:32.120- 35:39.440* :  moment. They're going to make history out there the next few days and so we're all hoping for
*35:39.440- 35:48.480* :  the best conditions. The photographer Ben Toire waiting for the big wave at the Olympic surfing
*35:48.480- 35:55.140* :  event in Tahiti, the centre of French Polynesia. And that's it from us for now, but there will
