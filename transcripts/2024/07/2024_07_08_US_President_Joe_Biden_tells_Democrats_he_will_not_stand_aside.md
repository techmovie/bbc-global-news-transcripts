*01:30.340- 01:35.220* :  I'm Valerie Sarterson and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 9th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:35.220- 01:39.480* :  The US President Joe Biden tells Democrats to unite behind him,
*01:39.800- 01:42.120* :  vying he will stand in November's election.
*01:42.800- 01:47.440* :  International condemnation after a Russian strike hits children's hospital in Kiev.
*01:48.000- 01:51.260* :  In Kenya, the leader of a doomsday cult goes on trial.
*01:53.520- 01:59.320* :  Also in this podcast, playmaker Boeing is ordered to urgently inspect thousands of oxygen masks.
*01:59.320- 02:05.280* :  And at the moment, the amount of people playing paddle compared to tennis is hugely, hugely different.
*02:05.360- 02:07.960* :  And I think there's room for all rackets sports.
*02:08.420- 02:11.460* :  A battle between racket games is tennis great.
*02:11.460- 02:16.900* :  Novak Djokovic says the future of his sport could be under threat from paddle.
*02:21.600- 02:26.820* :  We start this podcast in the United States where President Biden says he isn't going anywhere,
*02:27.240- 02:31.840* :  as he seeks to unite the Democratic Party ahead of the US election in November.
*02:31.840- 02:40.120* :  The last few weeks of the campaign have divided the party, causing some colleagues to call on the 81-year-old president to drop out of the race.
*02:40.140- 02:47.140* :  In an open letter to lawmakers, he stressed his ability to run and his commitment to defeating Donald Trump.
*02:47.140- 02:51.920* :  And Mr. Biden repeated that message in an interview with MSNBC.
*02:52.620- 02:56.300* :  The bottom line here is that we're not going anywhere.
*02:56.740- 02:58.180* :  I am not going anywhere.
*02:58.380- 03:04.760* :  I wouldn't be running if I didn't absolutely believe that I am the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2024.
*03:05.800- 03:09.100* :  We had a democratic nominee process where the voters spoke clearly.
*03:09.780- 03:12.240* :  I want four million of those votes, et cetera.
*03:12.240- 03:17.040* :  So, I just want, I'm not only believe that from the beginning,
*03:17.800- 03:20.200* :  but I wanted to reassert and demonstrate this, too.
*03:20.280- 03:23.520* :  And I'm going to be doing that all through this weekend from here on.
*03:24.160- 03:28.340* :  The BBC's U.S. partners, CBS News, is reporting that later,
*03:28.340- 03:32.660* :  the president reassured donors in a phone call that he is staying in the race.
*03:33.280- 03:38.440* :  On North America correspondent Anthony Zucker told me more about the letter to congressional Democrats.
*03:39.160- 03:47.320* :  That letter was an attempt to head off what is going to be conversations that are taking place in the Capitol as Democratic lawmakers,
*03:47.880- 03:50.740* :  head back to Washington after the Fourth of July recess,
*03:51.200- 03:56.380* :  and begin meeting face to face and having discussions about what to do about Joe Biden,
*03:56.380- 03:59.800* :  and whether to increase the pressure to get him to stand aside.
*03:59.800- 04:03.240* :  That letter directly targeted Democratic lawmakers,
*04:03.300- 04:08.680* :  and essentially made the case in Joe Biden's view on why he should still be the nominee,
*04:09.480- 04:11.260* :  and why he is not stepping aside.
*04:11.320- 04:16.880* :  He said that he was the best positioned to defeat Donald Trump.
*04:16.880- 04:26.420* :  He said also that he was the selected nominee during an open Democratic presidential primary process earlier this year,
*04:26.820- 04:32.880* :  and that to move away from him would be to deny the voices of millions of Democratic voters.
*04:32.880- 04:37.720* :  How can the Democratic Party be the party of democracy and Democratic values
*04:37.720- 04:43.080* :  if they throw out the legitimate votes cast by Democratic citizens,
*04:43.140- 04:49.500* :  and said now is the time after a week of concern to complaints that he has heard he says,
*04:50.000- 04:53.600* :  but now is the time for Democrats to get together because he's not getting out of the race
*04:54.080- 04:56.480* :  and unites so that they can defeat Donald Trump.
*04:56.480- 05:02.680* :  So it was a several page letter, and it laid out point by point about why Joe Biden's not going anywhere
*05:02.680- 05:05.040* :  and why Democrats need to move on from this.
*05:05.480- 05:06.700* :  Is this enough, do you think?
*05:06.940- 05:09.340* :  It is going to be a challenging week for Joe Biden.
*05:09.340- 05:13.740* :  He is hosting the NATO Summit here over the next few days in Washington, D.C.
*05:13.740- 05:16.740* :  He has a press conference, his first in months.
*05:16.800- 05:20.420* :  He is going to be under a microscope for the next few days.
*05:20.560- 05:23.580* :  Every action is going to be unpacked and analyzed.
*05:24.300- 05:27.260* :  If he can get through this week, if he can get through that press conference,
*05:27.260- 05:29.180* :  that might be enough.
*05:29.180- 05:33.160* :  But in the end, really, no matter how much pressure there is on Joe Biden,
*05:33.980- 05:36.400* :  he has the decision lies in his hands.
*05:36.420- 05:38.080* :  As he points out, he has the delegates.
*05:38.140- 05:42.320* :  He could get through these next few weeks, get to the convention, and be the nominee,
*05:42.320- 05:44.340* :  unless he decides to stand aside.
*05:45.040- 05:47.680* :  And if there's going to be a change, it has to be.
*05:48.220- 05:51.340* :  Hasn't it at the convention after that it is a done deal?
*05:52.840- 05:57.900* :  And it may even have to be before the convention, because the Democrats had been planning on
*05:57.900- 06:04.100* :  doing the nuts and bolts of the nomination process, where the delegates vote for the next nominee,
*06:04.100- 06:09.040* :  doing that virtually weeks before that end of August, Democratic convention.
*06:09.120- 06:13.900* :  So I think the people who oppose Joe Biden, who think the party would do better off,
*06:13.900- 06:20.120* :  going in a different direction, they understand that something has to happen in the next two weeks.
*06:20.120- 06:25.620* :  And if it doesn't, at that point, it may be too late to have any kind of an orderly process.
*06:25.620- 06:31.480* :  So this week, next week, really are going to be determinative on whether Joe Biden can continue.
*06:31.860- 06:32.780* :  Anthony Zürker.
*06:33.420- 06:39.580* :  There has been international condemnation after a wave of Russian missiles struck five Ukrainian cities,
*06:40.020- 06:41.520* :  killing more than 30 people.
*06:41.720- 06:48.180* :  One strike hit the Ahmed Deet Children's Hospital in the Capitol Keeve, leaving at least two dead.
*06:48.820- 06:52.660* :  Emergency services spent much of Monday going through the rubble and children,
*06:53.060- 06:58.500* :  many of them with cancer, were taken out onto the open street with medics fearing for their safety.
*06:59.180- 07:05.720* :  The strikes happened on the eve of a NATO summit, where military support for Ukraine will be a major point of discussion.
*07:06.340- 07:09.860* :  NATO's Yen Sultanberg described them as heinous attacks.
*07:10.580- 07:13.760* :  In Ukraine, Russia continues its brutal war.
*07:14.140- 07:19.400* :  Only today, we have seen horrendous missile attacks against the Ukrainian cities,
*07:20.140- 07:22.880* :  killing innocent civilians, including children.
*07:23.520- 07:26.040* :  I condemn these heinous attacks.
*07:26.640- 07:30.060* :  At the summit, we will make decisions to further strengthen our support to Ukraine,
*07:30.340- 07:34.220* :  and Russia must understand that they are not able to wait those out.
*07:34.940- 07:36.900* :  James Waterhouse has more from Keeve.
*07:40.660- 07:46.320* :  Every few months or so, there is a searing image, which breaks the grueling rhythm of Russia's invasion.
*07:47.000- 07:52.320* :  Young cancer patients, sitting outside the partially destroyed Ahmed Deet Children's Hospital in Keeve,
*07:52.660- 07:57.640* :  was a horrific illustration of how Moscow's relentless missile strikes don't discriminate.
*08:01.080- 08:03.520* :  It's where Lissia Liskecher works as a doctor.
*08:04.220- 08:07.700* :  The biggest part of the hospital, it's not totally destroyed,
*08:07.700- 08:12.380* :  but it's really very damaged near 60 or probably 70 percent of the hospital.
*08:12.620- 08:18.420* :  We are all involved in the process of evacuation patients in the nearest hospital,
*08:18.880- 08:21.560* :  just trying not to worsen their condition.
*08:21.840- 08:25.400* :  The majority part of these patients, they cannot go outside.
*08:25.400- 08:33.040* :  It's not so easy to evacuate patients who are intubated and ventilated after liver or kidney transplantation.
*08:33.480- 08:37.440* :  Rescue teams are still trying to get to people who have been buried under the rubble.
*08:37.780- 08:40.080* :  Medics in their green scrubs join the effort.
*08:40.740- 08:46.380* :  One of around 40 Russian missile struck here in an area of attack on several Ukrainian cities.
*08:47.120- 08:52.920* :  Alexander Marazenko is an MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Ukrainian Parliament.
*08:53.320- 08:57.900* :  I've been to such cities as Herzog, which is not far from frontline,
*08:58.500- 09:04.360* :  and each hospital was also their children's hospital, was deliberately targeted.
*09:05.280- 09:10.400* :  He says the hospital was not a coincidence because he said Russia had targeted other hospitals.
*09:10.400- 09:15.680* :  He said it was a message from Moscow, to NATO, ahead of its summit in Washington this week,
*09:16.180- 09:19.620* :  where ongoing military support for Ukraine will be discussed.
*09:20.520- 09:23.960* :  The EU has accused Russia of ruthlessly targeting civilians.
*09:24.440- 09:27.340* :  The UN Security Council is to meet to discuss the attack.
*09:28.220- 09:30.560* :  President Zelensky has promised to retaliate.
*09:32.140- 09:37.440* :  I would like to hear from our partners a greater resilience and a stronger response
*09:37.440- 09:44.000* :  to the blow that Russia has once again delivered on our population, on our land, on our children.
*09:44.740- 09:48.060* :  And here you should not wait for me. You should wait for our partners.
*09:48.580- 09:54.580* :  We will respond to these people. We will respond to Russia in a powerful way on our part, for sure.
*09:54.580- 09:58.280* :  The question for our partners is whether they can respond.
*09:58.280- 10:03.400* :  And with his forces now able to hit some targets inside Russia with Western weapons,
*10:03.400- 10:10.780* :  he can afford to be hawkish. His more nervous allies will be hoping that doesn't mean an escalation in long-range strikes.
*10:11.480- 10:12.360* :  James Waterhouse.
*10:13.160- 10:20.720* :  According Moscow has sentenced two prominent theatre personalities to six years in jail each for justifying terrorism.
*10:21.360- 10:27.380* :  Their arrest and subsequent trials sent shockwaves through Russia's artistic community, such as Lichten reports.
*10:28.340- 10:32.580* :  Finnish The Brave Falcon was first performed in Moscow in 2021.
*10:32.580- 10:40.500* :  It tells the story of Russian women who travelled to Syria during its civil war to marry ISG hadist they'd met online.
*10:40.500- 10:45.880* :  The following year, the play received two of Russia's most prestigious theatre awards.
*10:46.560- 10:49.700* :  But after Russia attacked Ukraine, the situation changed.
*10:49.700- 10:59.220* :  A group of Kremlin-appointed experts concluded that the play glorified terrorists, making them appear interesting and attractive to girls and women,
*10:59.680- 11:02.480* :  while portraying Russian men in a negative light.
*11:02.880- 11:08.780* :  Director Jean-Yborković and playwright Svetlana Petrichuk were arrested in May last year.
*11:09.300- 11:17.340* :  On Monday, a judge in a military court found there'd been justifying terrorism and sentenced each to six years behind bars.
*11:18.120- 11:21.860* :  An expert for the prosecution called to the stand in May said,
*11:21.860- 11:31.760* :  Finius The Brave Falcon contained the ideology of radical feminism, which healing to the conscious preparation and execution of terrorists acts.
*11:32.400- 11:40.420* :  The case has been closely followed by the Russian-speaking artistic community, who saw it as a test of the limits of artistic freedom.
*11:41.080- 11:42.040* :  Sasha Schlichter
*11:42.740- 11:49.660* :  In Kenya, the leader of a Doomsday cult has gone on trial in Ombassah over the deaths of more than 400 of his followers.
*11:50.280- 11:58.540* :  Paul and thank you Mackenzie, who was arrested in April last year, allegedly incited his accolades to starve to death in order to meet Jesus,
*11:59.000- 12:01.500* :  in a case which has attracted international attention.
*12:02.180- 12:06.120* :  Richard Kagawa, our Africa regional editor, who's in Kenya, gave him more details.
*12:07.000- 12:13.120* :  The man is accused of a couple of charges, actually, in total we're looking at four, and which he has denied.
*12:13.120- 12:20.500* :  So he's been charged with murder, with manslaughter, with terrorism, and with child abuse, but he's pleaded not guilty.
*12:20.500- 12:29.420* :  Basically, he's alleged to have radicalized his followers, because he's a controversial preacher, he's charged with all the hallmarks of a cult.
*12:29.420- 12:38.540* :  And what he did is that he taught his followers that the only way that they would meet with Jesus is actually if the would have stabbed themselves to death.
*12:39.120- 12:43.260* :  And we have close to about 400 people who lost their lives in the process.
*12:44.200- 12:46.560* :  And he isn't the only person on trial, is he?
*12:46.820- 12:52.260* :  Absolutely, he's got a co-defendant, so looking at a 94 of them, including his wife.
*12:52.880- 12:54.740* :  So tell us about the people who died.
*12:55.100- 13:01.180* :  Largely, these were men, children, and women who actually made up by the majority of them.
*13:01.980- 13:07.160* :  These were people from our poor backgrounds, the people who were literally seeking for help, they were desperate,
*13:07.820- 13:11.820* :  and they were looking for opportunities on anything that actually would improve their lives.
*13:11.820- 13:16.320* :  But then, of course, you would have pockets of people in there who are professionals.
*13:16.320- 13:23.820* :  One of the most notable was a young girl who was in her 20s and was an air hostess working for a Middle East airline.
*13:23.880- 13:28.640* :  So you'd have this mix of people that were involved in this cultic following.
*13:29.320- 13:31.000* :  And I mean, where was this happening?
*13:31.520- 13:37.300* :  So this was happening in a coastal town in South Eastern Kenya, a place called Kilific County.
*13:37.700- 13:43.440* :  It's a very remote area, so actually where much of the church's activity was taking place,
*13:43.440- 13:46.440* :  is a remote forest called Shakahola Forest.
*13:46.440- 13:50.100* :  It's next to a very big game reserve in that area.
*13:50.420- 13:56.700* :  The church didn't have typical structures, maybe like a cathedral or an auditorium of sorts.
*13:56.700- 14:02.460* :  There were people who were just setting up small houses, which are basically semi-paraminent structures.
*14:02.560- 14:07.640* :  And that's where they would be having the religious activities away from prying eyes.
*14:08.060- 14:12.340* :  And what about those who survived this? What's happened to them?
*14:12.760- 14:17.700* :  Those are just some of the people who are now being called up as witnesses for this hearing.
*14:18.100- 14:25.960* :  A lot of them have had to go through rehabilitation, you know, go through psychosocial support in the process of just rehabilitating them.
*14:26.280- 14:29.880* :  After really going through such a very traumatic experience, a lot of them,
*14:30.500- 14:34.740* :  because of this experience, have been very fearful actually to speak out even in public
*14:34.740- 14:36.440* :  and just to recount the experience.
*14:36.440- 14:39.440* :  And so that's where we've had some of the relatives who've been bold enough
*14:39.440- 14:43.340* :  who've just come and, you know, said exactly what their kin went through.
*14:43.780- 14:48.320* :  And Richard, how much interest is this case attracting in Kenya, where you are?
*14:48.920- 14:53.940* :  Well, this has really generated lots of interest, and especially for the most part of last year,
*14:54.540- 15:01.520* :  and really lift the lead to the extent to which some of these very rogue religious leaders
*15:01.880- 15:04.840* :  would go just to radicalize their followers.
*15:04.840- 15:12.680* :  So it's created a lot of debate, and there's been calls even for regulation of religious organizations in the country.
*15:13.420- 15:15.360* :  Richard Kagawa in Nairobi.
*15:17.860- 15:21.280* :  You're listening to the Global News podcast with me, Valerie Sanderson,
*15:21.280- 15:27.280* :  still to come, what now, for France, after no party claimed a majority in parliamentary elections?
*15:27.860- 15:28.300* :  And...
*15:28.300- 15:33.420* :  Jesus Christ is depicted reaching out to a band of His followers with crucifix in the background.
*15:33.420- 15:39.360* :  What's different about this work, though, is that Jesus' face is replaced with goofy's face.
*15:39.960- 15:45.440* :  A painting depicting Jesus as a cartoon character has caused a stir in Sydney.
*15:53.060- 15:57.920* :  This is the story of how a group of people brought music back to Afghanistan
*15:58.460- 16:02.340* :  by creating their own version of American Idol.
*16:03.620- 16:05.140* :  The joy they brought to the nation.
*16:05.660- 16:08.860* :  You're free completely. No one is there to destroy you.
*16:09.180- 16:10.780* :  The danger they endured.
*16:11.280- 16:13.520* :  It's set. My head should be cut off.
*16:14.300- 16:15.100* :  I'm John Legend.
*16:15.740- 16:20.940* :  Listen to Afghan Star on the I Heart Radio app or wherever you get your podcast.
*16:28.380- 16:30.760* :  On the previous edition of the Global News podcast,
*16:30.760- 16:36.580* :  we reported that the planemaker Boeing will pay a $243 million dollar fine.
*16:37.220- 16:41.840* :  That's related to two fatal crashes of Boeing 737 Max Planes
*16:42.040- 16:45.120* :  that killed 346 passengers and crew.
*16:45.740- 16:48.580* :  Now, more issues for the embattled company have emerged.
*16:48.580- 16:54.460* :  American regulators have ordered urgent inspections into thousands of 737 planes
*16:54.460- 16:59.020* :  over fears that the passenger oxygen masks on board could be faulty.
*16:59.540- 17:02.800* :  I spoke to our North America business correspondent, Aaron Delmore.
*17:03.200- 17:06.680* :  The concern is that these masks could fail in the case of an emergency.
*17:07.080- 17:10.980* :  And so regulators have ordered the inspection of 2,600 airplanes.
*17:11.580- 17:12.900* :  And to be more specific about it,
*17:13.380- 17:16.100* :  the Federal Aviation Administration is requiring that operators
*17:16.500- 17:18.100* :  check these passenger air masks,
*17:18.100- 17:20.780* :  the ones that are supposed to come down in an emergency
*17:20.780- 17:23.120* :  if the plane cabin pressure depressurizes,
*17:23.800- 17:26.100* :  to make sure that they haven't shifted out of position.
*17:26.760- 17:29.940* :  And that, if they're not in position, could potentially leave passengers
*17:29.940- 17:32.360* :  without access to the masks and an emergency.
*17:33.240- 17:36.940* :  Now, this is just the latest in a string of issues from Boeing, isn't it?
*17:37.260- 17:37.860* :  Absolutely.
*17:37.860- 17:41.100* :  And it feels like they've been coming one after another since January,
*17:41.100- 17:45.800* :  when we saw the door plug blow out of a flight operated by Alaska Airlines
*17:46.000- 17:47.700* :  during the flight in January.
*17:48.220- 17:53.000* :  And the reason why that was so significant is because at the time Boeing was in a bit of a probation period,
*17:53.480- 17:57.000* :  stemming from two fatal crashes back in 2018 and 2019
*17:57.720- 17:59.660* :  that killed 346 people.
*18:00.120- 18:04.680* :  And so questions have arisen about how far Boeing has come from then until now
*18:04.680- 18:07.700* :  to shore up its own safety record and quality control issues.
*18:08.060- 18:12.240* :  There were no deaths or fatalities in that January incident,
*18:12.240- 18:15.120* :  but it did bring Boeing's safety record back into the spotlight.
*18:15.820- 18:19.380* :  And how will this affect Boeing going forward?
*18:20.120- 18:22.800* :  Boeing seems to be facing criticism from all sides at this point.
*18:22.800- 18:26.100* :  It's not just when we see the CEO of the company, Dave Calhoun,
*18:26.100- 18:28.560* :  stepping in front of Congress and being grilled by lawmakers.
*18:28.560- 18:32.860* :  It also comes from regulators, not only the FAA, but the NTSB,
*18:33.200- 18:34.940* :  the National Transportation Safety Board.
*18:35.440- 18:39.020* :  And it comes from the airlines themselves who have been hesitant
*18:39.020- 18:40.800* :  to order more planes from Boeing.
*18:40.800- 18:44.120* :  And it comes from the traveling public who now hear about these stories
*18:44.120- 18:47.340* :  and feel anxiety about the flights that they have.
*18:47.820- 18:49.800* :  So certainly Boeing has had a rough few months.
*18:49.800- 18:53.520* :  You can see it even if you go back and look at how their stock prices shifted
*18:53.520- 18:55.860* :  since January down about 25%.
*18:56.540- 18:57.260* :  Erin Delmore.
*18:57.780- 19:02.300* :  France is emerging from election results that have caused a political earthquake in the country.
*19:02.960- 19:05.860* :  The vote in the second round of snap parliamentary elections
*19:05.880- 19:10.480* :  was split three ways among the far right, the center, and broad left.
*19:11.060- 19:14.980* :  Although the left got the most votes and no block has come close to majority,
*19:14.980- 19:18.860* :  which means the next few weeks will involve some delicate negotiation
*19:18.920- 19:20.000* :  and compromise.
*19:20.840- 19:23.940* :  President Emmanuel Macron has asked his prime minister, Gabrielle Attal,
*19:23.940- 19:27.780* :  to stay in the role for now, after Mr. Macron's centrist alliance
*19:28.180- 19:29.620* :  only managed second place.
*19:30.240- 19:32.480* :  Mr. Attal had offered his resignation.
*19:33.360- 19:36.640* :  A correspondent might lower in travel to a town south of Paris
*19:37.060- 19:40.020* :  that turned out to be the political bellweather of France.
*19:42.460- 19:47.520* :  Here at the Bureau Brasserie in Bretigny's George, just south of Paris,
*19:48.020- 19:51.660* :  Mines are on victory, not political, but sporting.
*19:52.160- 19:55.920* :  The French flags are out, the TVs are on, as they gear up
*19:55.920- 19:59.740* :  for France's Euro 2024 semi-final against Spain.
*19:59.740- 20:02.500* :  But while the country will come together for the match,
*20:02.500- 20:05.200* :  it's been deeply divided by the election.
*20:05.720- 20:08.560* :  This constituency mirrored the picture across France,
*20:08.960- 20:11.800* :  the far right national rally winning here in the first round,
*20:11.800- 20:16.260* :  but then the opposition uniting to stop them in the second, back in the left.
*20:16.260- 20:18.880* :  Sami Deval is the manager here.
*20:20.540- 20:21.540* :  I have Algerian origins.
*20:21.640- 20:25.560* :  A big part of the national rally program was anti-immigration, anti-Muslim.
*20:25.940- 20:28.700* :  I couldn't accept ideas that would be against half of my family.
*20:29.240- 20:32.120* :  Everybody woke up after the first round and went out to vote left
*20:32.120- 20:34.640* :  to block the far right, and I'm very relieved.
*20:38.320- 20:41.880* :  The Stakes and Burgers are sizzling away here in the kitchen,
*20:41.880- 20:45.740* :  topped with eggs and cheese for the lunchtime rush.
*20:46.360- 20:48.640* :  This was an area where the third-placed candidate
*20:48.640- 20:51.740* :  from the first round, from President Macron's centrist coalition,
*20:51.740- 20:54.300* :  dropped out to unite behind the left,
*20:54.800- 20:56.520* :  a tactic that worked across the country.
*20:56.520- 21:01.280* :  But there's still support for the far right from customers like Elisabeth.
*21:03.720- 21:06.460* :  I'm disappointed. I wanted the national rally to win.
*21:06.940- 21:08.540* :  They defend French identity.
*21:09.160- 21:10.380* :  And there's a lot of crime here.
*21:10.740- 21:12.240* :  The party wants to crack down on that.
*21:12.240- 21:14.180* :  It's why they're so supported in this area.
*21:14.780- 21:17.980* :  I still have hope that one day we'll have a national rally government.
*21:22.500- 21:23.700* :  As the exit poll came through,
*21:23.760- 21:26.980* :  there was stunned silence of the national rally HQ,
*21:27.580- 21:29.600* :  the chance of a first far right government
*21:29.600- 21:32.840* :  since the Second World War thwarted at the 11th hour.
*21:33.400- 21:36.920* :  But Stefan Milosevic, the defeated rally candidate here in Brittany,
*21:37.640- 21:39.120* :  tried to put a positive spin on it.
*21:39.380- 21:40.600* :  It's not a defeat for us.
*21:41.300- 21:44.600* :  I think we fight really well in these elections.
*21:47.420- 21:49.240* :  This alliance between the losing parties
*21:49.240- 21:51.480* :  stole this election from the French people.
*21:51.960- 21:55.500* :  70% of the French are in favor of reducing immigration.
*21:56.280- 21:57.100* :  We are patriots.
*21:57.580- 22:00.180* :  We just want people to respect our identity and culture.
*22:00.860- 22:02.420* :  Our victory is just delay.
*22:06.900- 22:09.600* :  But it's a victory now for the left-wing coalition,
*22:09.600- 22:11.060* :  the new popular front.
*22:11.660- 22:14.140* :  There were cheers and tears of relief,
*22:14.140- 22:15.740* :  as their numbers came through.
*22:16.360- 22:18.320* :  But without an overall majority for the left,
*22:18.680- 22:20.560* :  political commentator Silvi Kaufman says
*22:20.760- 22:22.040* :  there's still little clarity.
*22:22.500- 22:25.020* :  This is an unprecedented situation in France,
*22:25.100- 22:26.240* :  in the 5th Republic.
*22:26.320- 22:28.280* :  This is really the first time it has happened.
*22:28.960- 22:31.880* :  So can we learn the art of compromise,
*22:31.880- 22:35.720* :  which is so unusual for us?
*22:36.180- 22:36.880* :  I hope so.
*22:37.340- 22:41.920* :  The left program is not acceptable to all other forces in parliament,
*22:41.920- 22:44.120* :  so they will have to negotiate.
*22:44.460- 22:48.320* :  And so far it's very difficult to see how they will achieve this.
*22:51.040- 22:54.360* :  In the park in Brittany, after school playtime for families,
*22:54.360- 22:56.660* :  is a release from election tensions.
*22:57.360- 22:59.680* :  But the next generation is growing up in a country
*22:59.680- 23:02.760* :  that feels polarized, unsure of its future.
*23:03.300- 23:06.560* :  The far right may have been held off here and across France,
*23:07.060- 23:09.720* :  but with each election it gets closer to power.
*23:10.280- 23:12.640* :  And the national rally is playing the long game,
*23:13.260- 23:14.800* :  waiting for next time.
*23:17.160- 23:18.280* :  Mark Lohen reporting.
*23:20.100- 23:23.580* :  An artwork depicting Jesus with his followers overlaid
*23:23.580- 23:26.420* :  with faces of cartoon characters has been removed
*23:26.540- 23:27.900* :  from an art gallery in Sydney.
*23:28.400- 23:30.860* :  It came after a torrent of online abuse
*23:30.860- 23:34.500* :  was aimed against staff at the gallery and local city council.
*23:35.200- 23:38.360* :  The incident raises all sorts of questions about freedom of speech
*23:38.680- 23:39.980* :  and religious sensibilities.
*23:40.660- 23:43.700* :  Helena Burke is a former correspondent for ABC Australia
*23:44.060- 23:45.500* :  and she's book to Rachel Wright.
*23:46.320- 23:48.900* :  The painting first went on display in Western Sydney
*23:48.900- 23:50.400* :  about two months ago now,
*23:50.580- 23:53.060* :  and it was part of an exhibition that encouraged artists
*23:53.340- 23:57.020* :  to explore spirituality and religion through their art.
*23:57.560- 23:59.520* :  For the artists of the painting, Phil James,
*23:59.520- 24:02.260* :  that's exactly what he'd believed he'd done.
*24:02.700- 24:06.020* :  The artwork looks like a typical Renaissance era
*24:06.260- 24:07.340* :  biblical oil painting.
*24:07.340- 24:11.080* :  Jesus Christ is depicted reaching out to a band of his followers
*24:11.080- 24:13.000* :  with a crucifix in the background.
*24:13.580- 24:15.420* :  What's different about this work, though,
*24:15.420- 24:18.860* :  is that Jesus' face is replaced with Goofy's face,
*24:18.860- 24:20.360* :  the cartoon dog.
*24:20.760- 24:23.460* :  Some of Jesus' followers have had their faces replaced,
*24:23.460- 24:26.040* :  as well with what looks to be Daffy Duck
*24:26.040- 24:28.580* :  and potentially one of the seven dwarves.
*24:28.940- 24:31.020* :  We've also got Sylvestre the cat in the painting,
*24:31.020- 24:34.380* :  and you can see his bottom as he dives under Jesus' robe.
*24:34.900- 24:38.120* :  And what did the artist want to do with this?
*24:38.300- 24:40.800* :  Does he say, do we know what he was intending?
*24:41.540- 24:43.040* :  We haven't heard much from the artist.
*24:43.040- 24:46.140* :  We know that the local council who decided to remove the painting
*24:46.140- 24:48.140* :  said that he had supported their decision
*24:48.620- 24:50.020* :  and been understanding about it.
*24:50.380- 24:52.820* :  But we can assume from sort of what was instructed
*24:52.820- 24:57.040* :  about the exhibition that it was about sort of exploring religion
*24:57.140- 24:58.800* :  and making a comment on spirituality.
*24:59.580- 25:01.140* :  And of course, not everybody liked it.
*25:01.180- 25:02.940* :  There were a lot of objections.
*25:03.040- 25:03.920* :  Tell us about that.
*25:04.300- 25:04.700* :  That's right.
*25:04.740- 25:06.900* :  So Liverpool Council, which is the local council
*25:06.900- 25:10.000* :  where the gallery was, said they received a lot of complaints,
*25:10.000- 25:12.840* :  particularly from Christian and Muslim groups.
*25:13.460- 25:16.120* :  And ultimately, that's why they'd made the decision to remove it.
*25:16.760- 25:18.140* :  And what one of the Christian groups have written online
*25:18.960- 25:21.140* :  was that Christ shouldn't be mocked and depicted
*25:21.140- 25:24.560* :  as the cartoon character Goofy or Daffy Duck.
*25:25.420- 25:27.520* :  And is that the reason why it was removed?
*25:28.540- 25:29.360* :  That is what they've said.
*25:29.380- 25:31.800* :  They've sort of explained that you need to balance
*25:31.940- 25:33.020* :  or at least from their perspective.
*25:33.020- 25:35.080* :  You need to balance the right to free speech
*25:35.080- 25:36.980* :  with the right to practice your religion
*25:36.980- 25:39.120* :  without persecution or ridicule.
*25:39.760- 25:41.880* :  They also said, I'll read out this quote to you.
*25:42.400- 25:43.780* :  Quote, the Christian Messiah
*25:43.780- 25:45.680* :  and the Muslim Messiah, Jesus,
*25:45.680- 25:48.980* :  has no connection to the cartoon character Goofy.
*25:49.620- 25:50.240* :  Helena Burke.
*25:51.260- 25:53.120* :  While tennis fans from all over the world
*25:53.120- 25:56.080* :  are focused on the Wimbledon Tournament here in England,
*25:56.660- 25:59.120* :  one of the sport's biggest stars, Novak Djokovic,
*25:59.480- 26:01.120* :  says tennis may be under threat
*26:01.120- 26:03.700* :  from a different kind of racket game.
*26:08.620- 26:10.120* :  Well, Paddle is a racket sport
*26:10.180- 26:11.860* :  that's gaining popularity.
*26:12.480- 26:14.880* :  Stephanie Prentice is a regular paddle player
*26:15.240- 26:17.040* :  and explained to me how the game is played
*26:17.540- 26:18.980* :  and why it's so popular.
*26:19.620- 26:21.060* :  This is the fast-paced game.
*26:21.180- 26:22.320* :  It's really fun.
*26:22.740- 26:25.060* :  It's taken off particularly among younger people
*26:25.060- 26:27.420* :  that clip was one of thousands on TikTok.
*26:28.040- 26:30.020* :  And that noise that we heard, that comes from the bat.
*26:30.020- 26:32.740* :  It's quite hard and thick rather than a racket
*26:32.740- 26:35.520* :  and the ball is actually a little bit softer than a tennis ball.
*26:36.140- 26:38.040* :  I guess the easiest way to understand this
*26:38.060- 26:40.920* :  is the gameplay is tennis meets squash.
*26:40.920- 26:43.600* :  So we've got a shorter core, the necks in the middle,
*26:44.000- 26:45.100* :  and the players, if you imagine,
*26:45.100- 26:46.680* :  are using all four of the walls
*26:46.720- 26:47.940* :  like you would in swathe screen,
*26:48.340- 26:49.940* :  hit it off the side of the wall.
*26:50.580- 26:52.920* :  And it's primarily a doubles game in that sense
*26:52.940- 26:54.460* :  it's seen as more sociable,
*26:54.820- 26:56.680* :  even closer proximity to the other players.
*26:57.160- 26:58.660* :  And the clubs tend to have things like
*26:58.700- 27:00.860* :  music playing and bars within the space.
*27:01.680- 27:03.500* :  Now it is accessible to anyone
*27:03.920- 27:04.900* :  with a knowledge of tennis,
*27:05.140- 27:07.320* :  so the scoring system is the same.
*27:07.340- 27:10.620* :  But dare I say, it is easier to play.
*27:10.740- 27:12.300* :  I got to Paddle's social club in London
*27:12.300- 27:13.480* :  just before we came in here.
*27:13.480- 27:15.340* :  I spoke to its owner, Christian.
*27:15.860- 27:18.560* :  Paddle has seen as an attractive proposition
*27:19.320- 27:21.120* :  within the commercial world of sport.
*27:21.120- 27:25.120* :  More paddle courts can fit into a smaller space.
*27:25.700- 27:27.960* :  I think also because you're splitting the cost
*27:28.040- 27:29.360* :  between four people,
*27:30.040- 27:32.080* :  it makes it more affordable per person.
*27:32.400- 27:34.120* :  And finally, there's the additional element
*27:34.920- 27:35.140* :  outside of paddle,
*27:35.160- 27:37.880* :  which is where we've positioned our business
*27:37.880- 27:39.480* :  as a sort of social club.
*27:40.260- 27:41.680* :  So what Christian just touched on really,
*27:41.680- 27:44.080* :  that was part of Novak Djokovic's arguments.
*27:44.080- 27:45.140* :  He said on a club level,
*27:45.880- 27:47.120* :  this could be more viable for businesses.
*27:47.120- 27:49.120* :  It's more accessible, it's more affordable.
*27:49.860- 27:52.080* :  The suggestion being that that grassroots adoption
*27:52.120- 27:54.680* :  of a game is what eventually keeps it alive.
*27:55.480- 27:56.140* :  And how popular is it?
*27:56.140- 28:00.080* :  Is it something that more and more people are getting into?
*28:00.120- 28:02.100* :  I mean, does it appeal to all age groups, do you think?
*28:02.700- 28:03.140* :  It's really popular.
*28:03.140- 28:05.120* :  I mean, it started in Mexico in the 60s.
*28:05.220- 28:06.680* :  It's been really popular there.
*28:06.680- 28:07.940* :  It boomed in Spain.
*28:07.940- 28:09.860* :  It's the second most popular sport there.
*28:10.360- 28:12.140* :  We've seen celebrities like David Beckham playing
*28:12.140- 28:15.120* :  and Stormzy, and that's really driven interest on it.
*28:15.680- 28:17.820* :  In fact, the International Paddle Federation estimates
*28:17.820- 28:21.620* :  around 25 million people compete worldwide currently.
*28:22.060- 28:23.480* :  Now, Tia Norton is one of them.
*28:23.580- 28:25.640* :  She's the UK's top female player.
*28:26.140- 28:28.480* :  We asked her whether Paddle can display tennis
*28:28.480- 28:29.780* :  as Djokovic suggested.
*28:30.320- 28:32.540* :  At the moment, the amount of people playing paddle
*28:32.540- 28:35.240* :  compared to tennis is hugely, hugely different.
*28:35.560- 28:37.860* :  And I think there's room for all record sports.
*28:37.900- 28:40.800* :  There was actually a study to show that within 15 minutes
*28:40.800- 28:42.800* :  of paddle and 15 minutes of tennis,
*28:42.800- 28:44.540* :  there's a lot more paddle actually played.
*28:45.040- 28:47.020* :  Paddle rallies, they vary a lot.
*28:47.200- 28:49.140* :  And I think tennis rallies do as well.
*28:49.520- 28:51.480* :  But it depends what the spectator wants.
*28:52.360- 28:54.800* :  So as it stands, still a bit of a David and Glyath
*28:54.800- 28:56.460* :  when it comes to paddle versus tennis.
*28:56.460- 29:00.120* :  But as Tia was saying, it does really have a unique appeal.
*29:00.140- 29:02.040* :  And in fact, experts are predicting
*29:02.040- 29:06.020* :  it could be given the green light in the Olympics as early as 2032.
*29:06.860- 29:10.100* :  Reporter and indeed paddle player Stephanie Prentice.
*29:12.260- 29:13.120* :  And that's it from us for now,
*29:13.120- 29:16.120* :  but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*29:45.720- 29:50.580* :  This is the story of how a group of people brought music back to Afghanistan
*29:51.080- 29:54.980* :  by creating their own version of American Idol.
*29:56.220- 29:57.780* :  The joy they brought to the nation.

*30:01.800- 30:03.480* :  The danger they endured.
*30:03.880- 30:06.120* :  It felt my head should be cut off.
