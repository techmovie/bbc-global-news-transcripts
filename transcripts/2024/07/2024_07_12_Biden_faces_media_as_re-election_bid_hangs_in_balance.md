*01:22.060- 01:26.060* :  I'm Nick Mars, and in the early hours of Friday, the 12th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:26.460- 01:31.260* :  As more prominent Democrats call for Joe Biden not to seek re-election as US President,
*01:31.260- 01:35.080* :  he made another gaff at the end of the NATO summit in Washington.
*01:35.360- 01:40.180* :  And now I want to hand it over to the President of Ukraine, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin.
*01:40.940- 01:47.960* :  President Putin is a big president Putin. He held our live press conference after that,
*01:47.960- 01:53.080* :  the toughest test of his abilities since last month's presidential debate with Donald Trump.
*01:53.740- 01:59.040* :  In other news, Israel's Defense Minister has called for a state inquiry into what led to the
*01:59.040- 02:04.280* :  Hamas attacks of October the 7th last year. The Kenyan President, William Ruto,
*02:04.280- 02:11.320* :  the sacked almost his entire cabinet after scrapping proposed tax rises that caused nationwide unrest.
*02:11.780- 02:19.460* :  Also, in this podcast, she was the epitome of horrified in the shining film.
*02:28.820- 02:33.960* :  We look at the life and work of the American actor Shelley Duval, who's died at the age of 75.
*02:37.820- 02:42.740* :  We begin in Washington. The US President Joe Biden has held a solo and
*02:42.740- 02:48.440* :  unscripted news conference at the NATO summit, his first since what was widely seen as a very
*02:48.440- 02:54.040* :  disappointing debate performance last month against Donald Trump. This latest media event was
*02:54.040- 03:00.600* :  considered as a major test of his mental sharpness. Mr. Biden's performance at that earlier TV
*03:00.600- 03:06.400* :  debate sent short ways through his re-election campaign and several high-profile Democrats have
*03:06.400- 03:12.240* :  since urged him to drop out of the presidential election this year. The 81-year-old US President
*03:12.240- 03:18.380* :  has vowed to fight on, and insists he is the man to beat Mr. Trump in the November vote.
*03:19.060- 03:24.600* :  AIDS to Mr. Biden insists the election contest remains close despite the overwhelmingly negative
*03:24.600- 03:30.900* :  reaction to that earlier TV debate. But just hours before Mr. Biden approached the podium at the
*03:30.900- 03:36.120* :  NATO summit, several more fellow Democrats in the US Congress urged him to pull out of the
*03:36.120- 03:41.840* :  presidential race. They include Ed Case and Greg Stanton, who said voters needed to have faith
*03:41.840- 03:48.220* :  that Mr. Biden was fit to serve another four years in office. Other Democrats, like Brad Schneider
*03:48.220- 03:54.940* :  and Hillary Shulton, issued statements saying it was time to pass on the torch. Even big names of
*03:54.940- 03:59.800* :  Hollywood and donors to his party, including actor George Clooney and Michael Douglas,
*04:00.260- 04:05.820* :  are publicly calling on him to step down. Then at the closing ceremony of the NATO summit on Thursday
*04:05.820- 04:11.280* :  evening, President Biden had this to say as he stood on the stage close to the Ukrainian president
*04:11.280- 04:16.940* :  Vladimir Zelensky. My command all the nations has stepped up when it counted. To stand with Ukraine,
*04:17.800- 04:24.040* :  and said before, Russia will not prevail in this war, Ukraine will prevail in this war,
*04:24.520- 04:29.200* :  and will stand with them every single step of the way. That's what the compact says,
*04:30.080- 04:34.800* :  loudly and clearly. And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine,
*04:34.960- 04:40.640* :  who has as much courage as he has determination. Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin.
*04:42.420- 04:48.620* :  President Putin. He's got beat President Putin. President Zelensky. I'm so focused on beating
*04:48.620- 04:54.340* :  Putin. We got to worry about it. Anyway, Mr. President. I'm better. You are a hell of a better.
*04:56.200- 05:01.700* :  A slip of the time, but a serious one, nevertheless. I spoke to our Washington correspondent, Jenny
*05:01.700- 05:07.920* :  Kuma. My colleague, who's there at the conference, has basically said that there was a large gas
*05:07.920- 05:14.420* :  spin the media center when they heard that. So, even before this big news conference,
*05:14.420- 05:20.260* :  there's been this major gaff, miss calling, President Zelensky, President Putin, the Russian President,
*05:20.260- 05:26.100* :  and then the President Biden quickly correcting himself. And all ahead of what must be
*05:26.140- 05:32.400* :  quite nerve-wracking event for President Biden. It's been described by one commentator. He's
*05:32.580- 05:37.320* :  basically on a highway in front of the entire press corps. It's been described as the biggest
*05:37.320- 05:43.720* :  unscripted test for him since his shaky debate performance two weeks ago. And his team had
*05:43.720- 05:49.520* :  hopes that the NATO summit was the opportunity to move on from all the questions about his age
*05:49.520- 05:54.920* :  and suitability. And said what's happened. There's been mounting pressure on the President.
*05:55.100- 05:59.980* :  And even though there has been in recent days, there was a sense that perhaps things
*05:59.980- 06:05.600* :  have turned a corner with the influential congressional black caucus and key liberal members
*06:05.600- 06:11.880* :  of Congress voicing their support. But actually what we've seen in the last few days is just
*06:11.880- 06:17.260* :  that pressure continuing to build. Jenny Kuma, well, Helena Humphrey asked the U.S.
*06:17.260- 06:21.940* :  political analyst Mary Ann Marsh what she thought of Mr. Biden's mistake.
*06:22.680- 06:26.460* :  Well, I think that's going to get a lot of attention. And that's the situation Joe Biden's in.
*06:26.800- 06:31.900* :  Whether it's a press conference tonight where expectations are so high, it is impossible to think
*06:31.900- 06:37.140* :  he will clear them. And even if he does, that will be followed by yet another test, another day
*06:37.140- 06:42.440* :  or two from now, which he has to clear the bar. And that would have to go on for 116 days.
*06:42.920- 06:46.960* :  So one of two things is going to happen. After tonight, after the press conference,
*06:46.960- 06:53.380* :  after the NATO summit is now finished, is there a cascade of members of Congress senators and
*06:53.380- 07:02.080* :  others who call on him to step aside or can Joe Biden and his team stall in basketball, stall
*07:02.080- 07:08.620* :  ball, just trying to get through enough days to get by enough deadlines that it would be impossible
*07:08.620- 07:13.900* :  for anyone else to take his place and get through all the requirements that are necessary.
*07:14.380- 07:19.500* :  So I think the next four days, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday are four of the most consequential
*07:19.500- 07:25.540* :  days in American history, American politics, and could determine the fate of this country and its
*07:25.540- 07:31.160* :  democracy and that of the world. Well, just to put an argument to you from President Biden,
*07:31.400- 07:37.500* :  from the Biden campaign, they consistently say, look, President Biden is the person who has tried
*07:37.500- 07:43.200* :  and tested at beating President Donald Trump, the former president. He's done it before. He is
*07:43.200- 07:50.400* :  the person who therefore will be able to do it again. Do you support that or do you think that
*07:50.400- 07:54.860* :  this is a different President Biden to the one that won against Donald Trump?
*07:55.840- 08:00.960* :  That's the right argument and for whatever the debate has made it impossible, his debate
*08:00.960- 08:07.080* :  performance, impossible for people to get that message. And when you look at the polling and the
*08:07.080- 08:12.380* :  data, there's a lot of private polling out there. But if you look at some of the tracking polling
*08:12.460- 08:18.080* :  on number of them show that he's in the same place today as he was on the afternoon when I was on
*08:18.080- 08:22.920* :  your air of the debate, but that doesn't seem to be connecting with people. And I think it's an
*08:22.920- 08:28.740* :  impossibly tall task at this point. Yes, John, yes, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump four years ago.
*08:29.100- 08:33.300* :  Yes, he's been the best president in the last three and a half years, probably in my lifetime.
*08:33.340- 08:38.740* :  But none of the logic seems to be getting through. And what is most unfortunate are the people who
*08:38.740- 08:45.400* :  chose Joe Biden to be the nominee, run for reelection, have little say in this. It's really the
*08:45.400- 08:50.020* :  delegates that will be at the convention in August who get to cast those votes, not even the members
*08:50.020- 08:55.040* :  of Congress and U.S. Senators. They don't get to vote on the first ballot. They get to vote after
*08:55.040- 09:00.440* :  that. And that's the problem here. The people who who wanted him and have put him in the position
*09:00.440- 09:06.720* :  to be nominated also saw that debate performance. And for whatever reason, none of the logic is
*09:06.720- 09:12.020* :  prevailing in only the emotions. And the stakes could not be higher for our country and our
*09:12.020- 09:18.280* :  democracy. That was Mary Ann Mosh. Then a short time later, the U.S. President gave that crucial
*09:18.280- 09:22.900* :  news conference at the NATO summit. This is an excerpt of that event.
*09:23.540- 09:25.740* :  Felicia Schwartz, Financial Times.
*09:27.200- 09:32.340* :  Thank you, Mr. President. Presidency is the most straining job in the world and it's 24-7.
*09:32.860- 09:37.780* :  How can you say you'll be up for that next year in two years and four years given the limits
*09:37.780- 09:42.080* :  you've acknowledged that you have today? The limits I've acknowledged I have?
*09:43.380- 09:46.800* :  There's been reporting that you've acknowledged that you need to go to bed earlier and
*09:46.800- 09:57.000* :  during evening around 8. That's not true. Look, what I said was, instead of my every day starting
*09:57.040- 10:01.960* :  at 7 and going to bed at midnight, it'd be smarter for me to pace myself a little more.
*10:02.780- 10:08.120* :  And I said, for example, the 8, 7, 6 stuff, instead of starting the fundraiser at 9 o'clock,
*10:08.800- 10:13.820* :  starting at 8 o'clock, people get to go home at 10 o'clock. That's what I'm talking about.
*10:14.060- 10:19.480* :  I'm not talking about. And if you look to my schedule since I've made that stupid mistake of
*10:20.200- 10:26.100* :  in the campaign and in the debate, I mean, my schedule has been full bore.
*10:27.160- 10:31.700* :  I've done my worst trumpet, riding around in a golf cart, feeling out of scorecard before he
*10:31.700- 10:39.260* :  hits the ball. I mean, look, he's done virtually nothing. And I have, I don't know how many,
*10:39.720- 10:44.960* :  I don't hold me to roughly 20 major events, someone with thousands of people showing up.
*10:46.960- 10:53.440* :  And so, I just think it's better. I always have an inclination,
*10:54.220- 11:00.060* :  whether I was playing sports or doing politics, just to keep going, not style. I just got to
*11:00.540- 11:06.640* :  just pace myself a little more, pace myself. In the next debate, I'm not going to be traveling
*11:06.640- 11:12.700* :  into 15 time zones a week before. Anyway, that's what it was about.
*11:13.640- 11:18.880* :  The U.S. President Joe Biden. Earlier in the day at the NATO summit,
*11:18.880- 11:23.360* :  President Zelensky called on Western allies to stop putting pressure on Ukraine
*11:23.900- 11:28.820* :  to avoid hitting target inside Russia. He told the meeting in Washington that countries
*11:28.820- 11:33.900* :  shouldn't put restrictions on the use of donated weapons. From the summit, here's our defense
*11:33.900- 11:38.320* :  correspondent Jonathan Biel. Appearing at a news conference with the head of NATO,
*11:39.100- 11:43.220* :  President Zelensky said the alliance had taken important steps at this summit,
*11:43.840- 11:49.980* :  providing Ukraine with more air defenses, a pledge of another $40 billion in military aid,
*11:50.500- 11:55.200* :  and the promise that the country was on an irreversible path towards membership.
*11:55.920- 12:01.020* :  But more pressing, he said, was for allies to drop all restrictions on Ukraine's striking
*12:01.020- 12:07.460* :  military targets inside Russia with Western supplied weapons. If we want to win,
*12:07.740- 12:12.100* :  if we want to save the country, he said, we need to lift all limitations.
*12:13.120- 12:17.960* :  President Zelensky said he'd already had a positive response from Britain's new Prime Minister,
*12:17.960- 12:24.260* :  but he's also been putting pressure on the U.S. A key source of Ukraine's longer-range weapons.
*12:24.300- 12:30.260* :  The Kremlin has said that NATO's support for Ukraine is already a threat to Russia's national
*12:30.260- 12:36.420* :  security, and as warned, it will respond with unspecified coordinated measures.
*12:37.000- 12:42.060* :  Jonathan Biel in Washington. The last few weeks have seen widespread political and social
*12:42.060- 12:47.040* :  turmoil in Kenya. Street protests over proposed tax rises turned violent,
*12:47.040- 12:52.400* :  with Parliament being stormed, and dozens of protesters being killed by the security forces
*12:52.860- 12:57.560* :  across the capital. The President, William Ruto, then bowed to pressure and scrapped the
*12:57.560- 13:03.540* :  controversial tax plans, and now he's sacked almost his entire cabinet. In a televised
*13:03.540- 13:07.480* :  address, Mr. Ruto said he wanted to streamline his government and make it more efficient.
*13:08.080- 13:13.300* :  I will immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors
*13:14.440- 13:20.560* :  with the aim of setting up a broad-based government to deal with a burden of debt,
*13:20.620- 13:28.260* :  to explore raising domestic resources and revenues, eliminating wastage under necessary
*13:28.260- 13:35.460* :  duplication over multiplicity of government agencies, and slaying the dragon of corruption,
*13:36.180- 13:43.840* :  consequently making the government of Kenya lean, inexpensive, effective, and efficient.
*13:44.520- 13:49.880* :  I asked the BBC's Deputy Africa Editor Anne Sawie in Nairobi whether President Ruto
*13:49.880- 13:55.240* :  has done enough to satisfy the predominantly young protesters. They have welcomed that,
*13:55.280- 13:59.720* :  basically, the President was echoing the demands that they have been making on the streets
*14:00.360- 14:03.880* :  and on social media, and so they have welcomed the decision to
*14:04.860- 14:09.100* :  fire much of his cabinet. He's only left with his deputy whom he can't fire because it's
*14:09.100- 14:14.080* :  a constitutional office, and one more senior member of the cabinet. But they say that it is not
*14:14.080- 14:20.060* :  enough. They want to see action. They want to see him actually implement what he has promised
*14:20.060- 14:26.460* :  today, and also the rallying call on the streets has been Ruto must go. They want him to go as well,
*14:26.460- 14:30.740* :  but that is the subject of debate because there's no electoral commission in place at the moment,
*14:30.740- 14:36.580* :  and therefore the country cannot yet go to elections. Do you think he's able to implement
*14:36.620- 14:40.880* :  all of those things? Because there's a huge root and branch change, isn't it, within government?
*14:41.280- 14:47.140* :  It is. I mean, I can't remember any other protests in the country being this successful.
*14:47.180- 14:52.740* :  Fast he withdrew the finance bill, which is the legislation that was to introduce tax hikes
*14:53.140- 14:58.420* :  that was a win, and then the protests evolved into looking at the wider government and demanding
*14:58.420- 15:04.300* :  for it to be lean for the duplication to be eliminated and for the cabinet to be fired,
*15:04.820- 15:09.540* :  and the President has followed through with those, and he even met with the young people on
*15:09.540- 15:15.280* :  social media, on ex-spaces, and listened to them and spoke to them. And he promised that he
*15:15.280- 15:21.520* :  listened more because they accused him of not listening in the past. So he has been trying to
*15:21.520- 15:27.040* :  meet some of the demands that have been made by the protesters. They said that those are welcome,
*15:27.040- 15:32.920* :  but they are not enough. They need to see more action. They need to see the economy reinvigorated.
*15:32.920- 15:39.340* :  They need to see governmental agess dealt with and corruption. That was Ansoy in Kenya.
*15:40.880- 15:47.660* :  If you've ever seen the horror film classic The Shining, it is very hard to forget the terrorised
*15:47.660- 15:53.660* :  ash-and-face of the actor Shelley Duval, as she watched her on-screen husband's descent into
*15:53.660- 16:01.680* :  madness. It was a role that defined Ms Duval, who's died at the age of 75. But she also won the
*16:01.680- 16:07.300* :  coveted Best Actress Award at Cannes in her career. Our aunt's correspondent, Liza Mazimba,
*16:07.300- 16:11.340* :  looks back at her life. The Texas-born actress was known for playing
*16:11.340- 16:18.600* :  distinctive and often eccentric characters. She made her screen debut in 1970 in Robert
*16:18.600- 16:24.900* :  Altman's Brewster McLeod after being spotted by the film's producers at a party. She went on to
*16:24.900- 16:31.980* :  play a small part in the director's next film, McCabe and Mrs Miller. And in 1975, she also appeared
*16:31.980- 16:38.680* :  in his critically acclaimed satire Nashville. During the 1970s, she worked too with Woody Allen,
*16:38.680- 16:45.360* :  playing a magazine journalist in the Oscar-winning Annie Hall. The only word for this is trans-blendon.
*16:45.800- 16:52.020* :  She only appeared briefly, but her seemingly effortless performance helped her to steal every scene
*16:52.020- 17:00.620* :  she featured in. Sex with you is really a Kafka-esque experience. Thank you. I mean, that is a compliment.
*17:03.740- 17:07.860* :  But it was Stanley Kubrick's horror masterpiece, The Shining that brought her
*17:07.860- 17:14.060* :  stardom, playing Wendy, a terrified mother trapped in a remote hotel with her increasingly
*17:14.060- 17:28.520* :  unstable husband, played by Jack Nicholson. It was a part that required both fragility and courage.
*17:34.040- 17:40.060* :  She found the experience rewarding but grueling, and while Kubrick did sometimes make her perform
*17:40.060- 17:46.520* :  particular scenes multiple times, the often repeated claim that the director shot one scene
*17:46.520- 17:54.240* :  127 times is disputed by some film historians. At same year, she reunited with Robert
*17:54.240- 18:00.860* :  Oldman to play Olive Oil opposite Robin Williams in a cinema adaptation of Popeye. Over the
*18:00.860- 18:06.240* :  next 20 years, she appeared in a range of projects, including Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits,
*18:06.520- 18:12.560* :  Jane Campions, The Portrait of a Lady, and The Steve Martin Comedy Roxanne, before taking a
*18:12.560- 18:19.980* :  hiatus from acting in 2002. She returned to the big screen more than 20 years later in 2023,
*18:20.640- 18:24.980* :  for her final role in an independent horror film The Forrest Hills.
*18:25.960- 18:31.440* :  Liza Mazimba on the life of the U.S. actor Shelley Duvall, who's died at the age of 75.
*18:34.220- 18:38.360* :  Still to come. I thought the early bird always got the worm. I thought that was a good thing,
*18:38.360- 18:43.540* :  so it's nice to hear that actually those of us who function possibly a bit better at night are
*18:43.540- 18:48.300* :  doing quite well as well. New research shows that so-called night hours consistently
*18:48.300- 18:52.300* :  perform better and cognitive tests than those who get up early.
*19:00.640- 19:04.660* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless
*19:04.660- 19:08.400* :  companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*19:08.840- 19:11.420* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*19:11.500- 19:16.960* :  to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t?
*19:17.040- 19:22.380* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*19:22.500- 19:24.960* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.
*19:31.020- 19:36.060* :  John Grisham welcomes you back to Camino Island in his number one New York Times best seller,
*19:36.060- 19:41.020* :  Camino Ghosts. This time, a 300-year-old curse is stirring up more
*19:41.020- 19:45.640* :  trouble and paradise than ever before. Whether you're traveling with friends or family
*19:45.640- 19:50.580* :  or staying close to home this summer, everyone can get on the same page with this intriguing novel
*19:50.580- 19:56.660* :  that delivers sun, sand, and mystery. Camino Ghosts is in stores now, also available as an
*19:56.660- 19:58.380* :  audiobook read by Woopy Goldberg.
*20:03.260- 20:08.580* :  Israel's defense minister has called for a state inquiry into what led to the Hamas attacks
*20:08.580- 20:15.360* :  on October 7th last year. Yov-Galant said an independent probe was needed to examine the
*20:15.360- 20:20.840* :  actions of all those in power, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the past decade,
*20:20.860- 20:26.040* :  around 1,200 people were killed in the assault from Jerusalem Nick Beak reports.
*20:26.060- 20:31.760* :  Yov-Galant said a judge led inquiry was needed to identify how Hamas had grown in strength
*20:31.760- 20:36.280* :  and gained the capacity to carry out its marauding attacks last autumn.
*20:36.280- 20:40.620* :  His call was cheered by the crowd at a graduation for military officers,
*20:40.620- 20:46.380* :  which Benjamin Netanyahu was also attending. He has resisted calls for such an inquiry.
*20:47.060- 20:51.500* :  Although in the same Lecude party, the two men have been odds about the running of the war in
*20:51.500- 20:56.060* :  Gaza. Their actions are currently being examined by the International Criminal Court,
*20:56.480- 20:59.620* :  where the prosecutor has applied for arrest warrants for both.
*21:00.280- 21:05.080* :  Mystical Ant called for the National Inquiry after the Israeli army had briefed relatives of
*21:05.080- 21:11.560* :  the 101 people killed at Kabut's Barry on October 7th. He said all in the military had failed
*21:11.560- 21:17.060* :  to protect their citizens and must now rebuild trust so that it can continue its mission.
*21:18.240- 21:22.980* :  Nick Beak, or the Israeli military, dropped leaflets over Gaza City on Wednesday,
*21:23.540- 21:27.620* :  telling all residents to evacuate and head towards the center of the territory.
*21:27.620- 21:31.920* :  It's a second-time people have been told to flee the city since the start of the conflict.
*21:31.920- 21:36.680* :  The leaflets warn that the city is about to become a dangerous combat zone and give
*21:36.680- 21:42.300* :  instructions on safe evacuation routes. International pressure on Israel is said to be increasing
*21:42.300- 21:46.240* :  after dozens of people were killed on Tuesday in Israeli air strikes.
*21:46.240- 21:51.580* :  Women and children were amongst those sheltering in a school east of the city of Han Unis.
*21:52.000- 21:57.940* :  Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says the air strike was aimed at a nearby camp for displaced
*21:57.940- 22:03.700* :  people. Virgil Keen reports on the aftermath of the strike and a warning that some of the details
*22:03.700- 22:13.100* :  may be distressing for listeners. The women of the House of Abu Abed.
*22:17.460- 22:24.000* :  They have lost a brother. Muhammad was 27, trained to teach special needs children,
*22:25.100- 22:30.860* :  and about to be married. He was going out to call his fiance.
*22:31.800- 22:37.440* :  Next week, the boy days will open and he could go see her. He joked, goodbye Gaza, goodbye.
*22:40.060- 22:45.240* :  Muhammad was planning to join his future wife in Egypt. Her family escaped there after
*22:45.240- 22:50.600* :  nine were killed in an earlier air strike. His sister-in-law in us,
*22:50.600- 22:55.980* :  blinded in one eye then. And Muhammad's fiance, Hadil.
*23:01.740- 23:07.800* :  Up to the last minute, I was planning for him to arrive here. We were going to stay for a while,
*23:08.820- 23:14.140* :  and if things improved, go back to Gaza. Now, I don't know what to do.
*23:14.480- 23:21.700* :  The missile was fired around 730 in the evening.
*23:24.680- 23:33.020* :  Youths playing nearby in Al-Ada ran to health, and saw children's bodies, parts of bodies.
*23:35.360- 23:40.420* :  Israeli military says it was targeting a Hamas member allegedly involved in the October 7th
*23:40.420- 23:44.460* :  massacres. In doing so, they killed 29 people.
*23:51.780- 24:00.840* :  Dozens more were wounded. They've been bombed, displaced, from one fragile refuge to another.
*24:01.340- 24:11.420* :  And there is what they have seen and what cannot be unremembered.
*24:12.440- 24:18.560* :  The Israelis say they used precise munitions and are reviewing the circumstances of the air strike.
*24:22.920- 24:26.420* :  The teacher, Muhammad Abed, was one of those buried today.
*24:26.860- 24:29.540* :  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
*24:30.480- 24:37.060* :  By sisters still trapped in this hell, grieving for him, and for what their children must endure.
*24:38.700- 24:46.260* :  That report was by Fergalkean. No one, it seems, is building more solar and wind plants than China.
*24:47.060- 24:52.180* :  In fact, Beijing is constructing twice as many plants as the rest of the world combined.
*24:52.180- 24:57.020* :  That's according to a US-based think tank, which also highlights the fact that China
*24:57.020- 25:02.460* :  also remains the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. I heard more from our environment
*25:02.460- 25:09.000* :  correspondent, Matt McGraw. China has really been booming on wind and solar for a number of years.
*25:09.000- 25:14.040* :  It's one of these things where it's taken off slowly in about 2010, 2011, and over the last decade
*25:14.040- 25:19.520* :  or so, it's really ramped up to speed. So much so now that two-thirds of the plants and solar
*25:19.520- 25:24.400* :  and wind under construction in the world are in China, it dwarfs everybody else. I mean,
*25:24.400- 25:30.220* :  incredibly bigger than everybody else. Just simply is on a scale we've never seen in the world
*25:30.220- 25:35.300* :  before and the speed at which this is now happening, the amount of announcements that it made that
*25:35.300- 25:41.160* :  was actually building in August really well for China's move away from coal and indeed for the
*25:41.160- 25:46.080* :  world's perspective on emissions over the next couple of years. In August well for the move away
*25:46.080- 25:51.700* :  from coal, but this report also highlights, at the moment there is a huge dependence on coal,
*25:51.700- 25:56.540* :  isn't it? Yeah, this has long been known as well. China obviously burns coal, it's the key
*25:56.540- 26:02.460* :  element of what it produces, but things are changing there too. In May just gone, the month of
*26:02.460- 26:09.020* :  May just gone, coal provided 54% of the energy in China, 44% came from non-fossils, which is wind,
*26:09.020- 26:14.500* :  solar, hydro power and many other things. And Matt, remind us about Beijing's greenhouse gas
*26:14.500- 26:19.160* :  commitments and is it likely to meet them? Yeah, this is a big policy and it's an important
*26:19.160- 26:23.820* :  policy for the world. They have said that they will peak their emissions before 2030 or around
*26:23.820- 26:31.180* :  2030 and reaching at zero or by around 2060. At the current rate of expansion, many scientists and
*26:31.180- 26:36.540* :  observers believe they may already have peak their emissions. Certainly, they promised that they
*26:36.540- 26:42.120* :  would get to about 1200 gigawatts of wind and solar by 2030. They're likely to have done that
*26:42.520- 26:49.380* :  by now essentially. So many people believe that they're essentially in the process or have already
*26:49.380- 26:54.860* :  peaked their emissions, which would be amazing news for the world. And the scale of this deployment
*26:54.860- 27:00.080* :  as well would also be a real shot in the arm for global leaders who last year in Dubai promised
*27:00.080- 27:05.840* :  to travel the amount of renewable energy in the world by 2030. This would move it very much along
*27:05.880- 27:10.140* :  the way. Now, I have to say, there's a number of providers here. The providers are, it's easy to
*27:10.140- 27:15.600* :  build big wind and solar, connecting it to the grid and getting it used and keeping it working
*27:15.600- 27:19.620* :  with the batteries that you need and the other elements that you need to keep a grid working
*27:19.620- 27:26.780* :  is much more difficult. That was Matt McGraw. Apple has struck a deal with the European Union to
*27:26.780- 27:33.040* :  settle a long-running dispute over mobile payments. The company was facing a big fine for blocking
*27:33.040- 27:39.920* :  alternatives to its own tap and go technology. Apple pay on the iPhone. More from our technology
*27:39.920- 27:45.960* :  reporter, Chris Vance. At the moment, the tech can only be used by Apple pay and Apple wallet.
*27:46.940- 27:52.160* :  The EU thought that was anti-competitive and Apple has now agreed to sort of settle this long-running
*27:52.160- 27:58.060* :  investigation by opening up their tech for rivals for users in the European economic area. So
*27:58.360- 28:02.560* :  those rivals will be able to create their own contactless payment systems, if you like. They
*28:02.560- 28:08.240* :  have to do it by the 25th of July. If it hadn't, it risked having to open up its own wallet
*28:08.240- 28:12.140* :  because the fines are potentially pretty eye-watering and 10% of global turnover,
*28:12.140- 28:18.800* :  that would be about $40 billion. Chris Vance. Now, do you like getting up early or do you
*28:18.800- 28:24.280* :  operate better later in the day? In a new study, researchers from Imperial College London
*28:24.280- 28:30.600* :  examined sleep data from more than 26,000 people to explore the links between their sleeping patterns
*28:30.600- 28:36.280* :  and their cognitive abilities. They found that an individual's preference for evening or
*28:36.280- 28:43.020* :  morning activity strongly correlated with their test scores. In particular, Nulley Towers consistently
*28:43.020- 28:49.780* :  performed better in cognitive tests than early birds. I'm a bit of a night owl and Nulam Agavan
*28:49.780- 28:55.820* :  spoke to her night owl colleague James Krumasami and began by asking him, what time does he like to get
*28:55.820- 29:00.660* :  up? As late as possible, I think, Nuley. I thought the early bird always got the worm. I thought
*29:00.660- 29:05.620* :  that was a good thing. So it's nice to hear that actually those of us who functioned possibly a
*29:05.620- 29:10.380* :  bit better at night and enjoy the darker owls. There's something of the night about me perhaps.
*29:10.380- 29:16.560* :  I don't know what it is doing quite well as well, but no, I enjoy the the lateness. I think
*29:16.560- 29:22.160* :  possibly it dates back to those days at university with those cramming essays in at the very last
*29:22.160- 29:27.580* :  minute, the essay crises, somehow that focused the mind. So I think I've kept that on. So yes,
*29:28.360- 29:33.000* :  the morning, not so much the nighttime, yes, and I just don't understand when someone says to me,
*29:33.000- 29:37.260* :  I'm going to have an early night. I don't know what that means. And it doesn't compute.
*29:37.600- 29:41.860* :  This is something I didn't know about you if I'm completely honest. And I have to say in those
*29:41.860- 29:47.360* :  college days when people were cramming, you know, were you'd find me snoring on the sofa? It was
*29:47.360- 29:54.560* :  all over. I might get up super early before the exam to try and and cram a little bit, but
*29:54.560- 30:00.020* :  forget about the overnight and I have done overnight in my career, but it took a lot of physical
*30:00.020- 30:05.540* :  effort. Well, apparently with this, I mean, they do talk about the world, and I'd be curious
*30:05.540- 30:12.160* :  for your thoughts on this, the world really being built into a nine to five schedule. And that might
*30:12.160- 30:17.320* :  be why this early bird gets the worm, just because the world has been set up for early birds or
*30:17.320- 30:23.060* :  larks, as they're called, as opposed to those that are working on a laser schedule or that come to
*30:23.060- 30:28.980* :  life after 6 p.m. I wonder have you found that? Yeah, and I was always jealous. We've both lived in
*30:28.980- 30:33.960* :  America, no, you know, people in America, a lot of people I came across seem to get up very,
*30:33.960- 30:40.900* :  very early. I was, they always seem to be so active. So they got more out of life. And as I
*30:41.880- 30:46.140* :  realized, perhaps this is just not for me, I thought, you know, I will, I will stick with my
*30:46.140- 30:51.200* :  comfort zone. I will try and be more productive at night. And it's probably not a coincidence
*30:51.200- 30:56.280* :  that when you and I are not presenting the user, you present a program in the morning that I
*30:56.520- 31:01.980* :  present a program in the evening. So chicken and egg, I don't know how we got to that stage,
*31:01.980- 31:06.120* :  but it's it's both of our comfort zones. It's interesting. You've reminded me of two things,
*31:06.120- 31:11.760* :  as you're speaking there. I was in New York with NewsHour, not so long ago. And what has become
*31:12.440- 31:20.460* :  the most coveted reservation time for a meal is now 6 p.m. And that city has shifted
*31:21.020- 31:26.440* :  earlier again. You're also reminding me of what people might see on their social media feeds at
*31:26.440- 31:31.420* :  the 5 a.m. club, which is basically talking about some of these high-powered people. They get up at
*31:31.420- 31:36.140* :  5 a.m. and get the gym dollar. They're journaling or they're meditation or whatever it might be.
*31:36.540- 31:42.740* :  But I have to say, even as an early bird, 5 a.m. is a little bit too early. Too early for me.
*31:42.740- 31:48.740* :  Definitely. I'll go the other way. I'll go midnight 1 a.m. James Kumerasami. Let's return to our
*31:48.740- 31:53.500* :  main story now. Ahead of a crucial news conference at the NATO summit in Washington,
*31:53.500- 31:59.960* :  Joe Biden has introduced the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, as president Putin on stage.
*31:59.960- 32:05.600* :  The mistake which drew gasps from the audience came on the day that several more Democrats in
*32:05.600- 32:12.400* :  Congress urged Mr. Biden to pull out of the US presidential race. Mr. Biden then gave that crucial
*32:12.400- 32:19.180* :  news conference. I think how can I say this without sounding too self-serving.
*32:21.160- 32:27.580* :  I'm not having any of my European allies come up here and say, Joe don't run.
*32:29.040- 32:36.580* :  What I hear them say is, you've got to win. I can't let this guy come forward. He'd be disaster.
*32:39.600- 32:43.220* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*32:43.220- 32:48.340* :  later on. If you want a comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
