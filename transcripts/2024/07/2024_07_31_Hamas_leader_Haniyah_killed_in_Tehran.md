*01:36.520- 01:39.400* :  Welcome to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:41.360- 01:46.580* :  I'm Chris Barrow, and at 13 GMT on Wednesday, the 31st of July, these are our main stories.
*01:46.580- 01:52.320* :  Hamas says its political leader, Ismail Haneer, has been killed in an Israeli strike in Tehran,
*01:52.320- 01:57.760* :  Iran vows revenge. Kamala Harris takes the fight against Donald Trump to the crucial state of
*01:57.760- 02:02.020* :  Georgia, and small but important, a rise in interest rates in Japan.
*02:05.680- 02:09.800* :  Also in the podcast, how Indonesia wants to wean young people off cigarettes?
*02:10.400- 02:15.700* :  And it kind of gives us an excuse to treat them poorly because if we have a low opinion of
*02:15.700- 02:19.900* :  their intelligence, then, you know, perhaps we can abuse them and get away with it.
*02:20.340- 02:22.800* :  Our goldfish memories really that bad.
*02:27.140- 02:38.340* :  But first, we start with sounds from Tehran University this morning as demonstrators marched
*02:38.340- 02:43.080* :  holding photographs of Ismail Haneer, the Hamas political leader who was killed in the city.
*02:43.540- 02:47.280* :  After what Hamas has said was an Israeli strike on the house where he was staying,
*02:47.280- 02:51.280* :  just hours after attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president.
*02:51.960- 02:55.300* :  These Palestinians in the West Bank city of Ramallah condemned the killing.
*02:58.200- 03:02.280* :  Frankly, the news was shocking for all Palestinian people at home and abroad.
*03:03.020- 03:08.540* :  It was a cowardly operation, and another crime to add to the occupations record of
*03:08.540- 03:14.220* :  assassinations of resistance fighters, Mujahideen, and leaders of the Palestinian people.
*03:14.220- 03:17.320* :  Now I'm having good luck, and I am at what direction?
*03:17.320- 03:23.100* :  There will be a response. There will be a strong response, and also a response from Lebanon.
*03:23.940- 03:27.700* :  There will also be a reaction to the crime in Lebanon yesterday.
*03:28.720- 03:33.060* :  Today, we are facing a disaster with the assassination of the martyr,
*03:33.060- 03:35.340* :  Commander Ismail Haneer.
*03:37.520- 03:40.960* :  Israel hasn't taken responsibility for the killing, but the Defence Minister,
*03:40.960- 03:46.680* :  Yohav Galant, said Israel is not seeking to escalate war, but is prepared to handle all scenarios.
*03:47.340- 03:50.920* :  The U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has stressed the importance of continuing
*03:50.920- 03:53.800* :  discussions on a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict.
*03:54.360- 03:58.920* :  We've been working from day one not only to try to get to a better place in Gaza,
*03:58.940- 04:04.140* :  but also to prevent the conflict from spreading, whether it's on the North, with Lebanon and
*04:04.140- 04:11.420* :  Hezbollah, whether it's the Red Sea, with the Houthis, whether it's Iran, Syria, Iraq, you name it.
*04:12.500- 04:18.000* :  And I'm not going to speculate on what impact any one event might have on that.
*04:18.600- 04:21.540* :  I asked Saeed Shahata of BBC Arabic for more details.
*04:22.320- 04:27.960* :  The information we have only from Hamas, a statement saying, a raid against the
*04:28.280- 04:31.800* :  residents of Mr. Haneer in Tahran, ended to kill him.
*04:32.180- 04:36.480* :  So, the accused Israel for the killing or assassination, according to the statement.
*04:37.140- 04:40.760* :  Israel responded, they don't comment on media reports.
*04:40.760- 04:48.700* :  So, this is the situation, but there is nothing more except the fear of the reactions of Hezbollah,
*04:48.700- 04:56.000* :  Iran, Houthi Niyaman, and some other radical-medicine group like Al Qaeda and Islamic State,
*04:56.800- 05:02.440* :  they might capitalize on this occasion to get more support for their cause and do something.
*05:02.440- 05:10.320* :  So, it might be some targets outside Israel, and the hope is the reaction from Iran and Hezbollah
*05:10.320- 05:14.180* :  and the others will not be massive for the Israel to react.
*05:14.180- 05:19.860* :  This case will be escalating for unwanted and all our toward between Hezbollah and Iran
*05:19.860- 05:21.760* :  from one side and Israel from other side.
*05:22.000- 05:24.620* :  I just mentioned a couple of the countries who have reacted so far.
*05:24.620- 05:28.840* :  The U.S., Anthony Blinken, we've heard some comments from Yoav Galan there,
*05:28.840- 05:33.140* :  but what are other countries saying, presumably, to try and de-escalate this situation?
*05:33.420- 05:37.220* :  As always, the reaction is on the escalation side, because for example,
*05:37.220- 05:40.560* :  Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Guide of the Rainer Revolution,
*05:40.620- 05:46.000* :  said their revenge for the assassination of Haneer, it said Yutti on Iran.
*05:46.000- 05:48.280* :  So, it is on its editing side.
*05:48.860- 05:53.700* :  The Prime Minister of Qatar says the assassination and escalation will both
*05:53.700- 05:55.920* :  question, how can you conduct the negotiation,
*05:56.420- 05:59.220* :  while one side kills the other side of the negotiation?
*05:59.220- 06:03.620* :  So, it is implicitly accusing Israel of doing that, and this will affect.
*06:03.620- 06:07.200* :  So, while Mr. Blinken is saying, it might not affect the ceasefire,
*06:07.200- 06:12.840* :  it will go on, but I don't think so, because from Jordan to Egypt to Qatar,
*06:12.840- 06:16.440* :  to Turkey, to China, to Russia, all of them saying,
*06:16.440- 06:20.560* :  what happened will end to escalation, to chaos in the region.
*06:20.880- 06:24.420* :  So, there is fear from the statement from these countries,
*06:24.420- 06:28.040* :  there is might something wrong happened, and no one wants the war.
*06:28.060- 06:30.780* :  Iran doesn't like the war, Israel doesn't like the war,
*06:31.120- 06:35.080* :  because Iran cannot do that, because you have economic problems in size,
*06:35.080- 06:35.840* :  you have many problems.
*06:35.840- 06:39.100* :  Israel also cannot fight on different fronts, even Mr. Galan say,
*06:39.460- 06:41.920* :  there are different scenarios supported by the United States,
*06:41.920- 06:45.020* :  but I don't think they can fight on different fronts.
*06:45.020- 06:48.420* :  So, in reality, they cannot do like an all-out war,
*06:48.420- 06:50.740* :  but their reaction will be reaction,
*06:50.780- 06:53.880* :  will be some military action from Hezbollah and Iran.
*06:53.880- 06:56.520* :  It's not going to be, there is no reaction from there.
*06:56.580- 07:00.400* :  And for example, the Musa al-Mazouk, one of the members of the political bureau,
*07:00.400- 07:04.640* :  which was headed by Mr. Haneyeh, said it is a coward action,
*07:04.640- 07:07.660* :  will not be passed without any reaction from Hamas.
*07:07.660- 07:09.840* :  So, all of Hamas, Hezbollah and others,
*07:10.280- 07:13.440* :  there is a tendency to revenge from that,
*07:13.840- 07:18.020* :  but also hope that will not be like massive for an all-out war to be happened.
*07:18.480- 07:19.660* :  It's not going to be good for everyone.
*07:48.140- 07:50.720* :  Israel, since October the 7th,
*07:50.720- 07:55.060* :  sons and grandchildren who were traveling with them killed by the Israelis.
*07:55.060- 07:59.140* :  Now, what is interesting about this, well, many things,
*07:59.160- 08:03.100* :  but Haneyeh was not a figure that lived in hiding,
*08:03.680- 08:05.740* :  like the leaders of the military wing,
*08:05.740- 08:09.140* :  and I think the Israelis are frustrated, they have not hit,
*08:09.400- 08:11.600* :  they have mostly get to Yahya Sinwah,
*08:11.600- 08:14.120* :  who is the Hamas commander in Gaza,
*08:14.120- 08:16.580* :  and the mastermind of the 7th of October.
*08:16.840- 08:20.700* :  So, you know, assuming it was Israel who killed him,
*08:20.700- 08:22.660* :  I can't see who else it might be,
*08:23.320- 08:26.040* :  and they haven't commented as, yeah, as I speak to you anyway,
*08:26.840- 08:28.320* :  why are they doing it now,
*08:28.320- 08:32.020* :  when they must have had some chances in the past.
*08:32.060- 08:36.880* :  Now, it was not politically possible for them to kill him in Qatar.
*08:37.660- 08:41.140* :  Killing him in Iran, though, does send a message about Israel's reach,
*08:41.200- 08:43.520* :  a message that no one is safe.
*08:44.240- 08:47.900* :  One other thing, the Americans are saying repeatedly,
*08:47.900- 08:49.940* :  and not just the Americans, the British as well,
*08:49.940- 08:52.720* :  and others, Israeli allies are saying to them,
*08:53.140- 08:56.060* :  try not to escalate what's going on in the Middle East.
*08:56.420- 08:59.360* :  Haneyeh was involved in the ceasefire and hostage release talk,
*08:59.360- 09:01.520* :  so that this is not going to make those any easier.
*09:01.940- 09:05.100* :  He was essentially a guest of the Iranians,
*09:05.240- 09:07.440* :  and he was under their protection,
*09:07.980- 09:10.640* :  and the Iranian security guard was killed as well, apparently,
*09:10.640- 09:12.800* :  in this assassination.
*09:12.800- 09:15.420* :  We don't have any details as yet about how it happened.
*09:16.020- 09:18.660* :  I think the Iranians will have to ponder hard
*09:18.660- 09:21.060* :  about how they do respond if they do.
*09:21.060- 09:24.000* :  I imagine they might, in some particular way,
*09:24.000- 09:26.800* :  because you'll remember that they responded
*09:27.560- 09:31.280* :  after there was an Israeli raid on their embassy compound
*09:31.280- 09:35.000* :  in Damascus, killing senior officials a few months ago,
*09:35.180- 09:37.800* :  and then they responded with an attack on Israel.
*09:38.400- 09:41.060* :  So will they want to do something like that?
*09:41.600- 09:44.660* :  Again, that was quite a telegraph to attack.
*09:44.660- 09:47.820* :  People knew it was coming, as if they had to do it,
*09:48.040- 09:50.080* :  but they didn't want to escalate things too much.
*09:50.580- 09:53.120* :  I don't think the Iranians want a more intense war
*09:53.120- 09:54.740* :  in the region at the moment,
*09:55.260- 09:57.200* :  and I think perhaps because of that knowledge,
*09:57.200- 09:59.900* :  the Israelis feel that they can push harder.
*10:00.180- 10:03.160* :  But of course, Israel now finds itself really engaged
*10:03.160- 10:07.100* :  in active military combat on multiple fronts
*10:07.140- 10:08.540* :  to the east, to the north.
*10:09.020- 10:13.240* :  And the question is, do they have sufficient resources,
*10:13.240- 10:15.560* :  military resources, and do they have sufficient
*10:15.560- 10:19.000* :  international support to sustain military combat
*10:19.000- 10:19.860* :  on multiple fronts?
*10:20.320- 10:21.320* :  Yeah, multiple fronts.
*10:21.360- 10:24.440* :  That attack in Beirut, killing they say,
*10:24.920- 10:27.920* :  it's not confirmed as yet, top his by the commander.
*10:28.580- 10:30.640* :  And don't forget, not that many days ago,
*10:30.640- 10:34.120* :  there was a big raid as well in Yemen against the Houthis.
*10:34.820- 10:37.440* :  So these Israelis are extremely active at the moment
*10:37.440- 10:38.940* :  in terms of military resources.
*10:38.940- 10:41.200* :  They are a very powerful country.
*10:41.960- 10:44.880* :  And most importantly, they have the United States behind them,
*10:45.300- 10:48.080* :  who have since the seventh of October
*10:48.740- 10:52.400* :  done a massive airlift of munitions and weapons
*10:52.540- 10:54.680* :  and the things that the Israelis require.
*10:54.680- 10:58.100* :  So I think they have that capacity, however,
*10:58.740- 11:01.180* :  it's a deeply divided, unhappy country.
*11:01.240- 11:02.920* :  You saw those scenes the other day
*11:02.920- 11:06.300* :  when there were, if you like, almost vigilante attacks
*11:06.300- 11:11.160* :  on Israeli army bases to try to pull out soldiers
*11:11.160- 11:15.020* :  who had been accused of torturing sexual assault,
*11:15.020- 11:17.020* :  the rape of a prisoner.
*11:17.600- 11:21.300* :  And there were mobs who were led by members of parliament
*11:21.300- 11:23.380* :  who were trying to get them out.
*11:23.380- 11:25.840* :  So on the home front, there's a lot of division
*11:25.840- 11:28.200* :  and unhappiness and these massive challenges
*11:28.880- 11:29.720* :  around the region.
*11:29.720- 11:33.400* :  And Israel seeming the pushing heart against its enemy.
*11:33.400- 11:37.380* :  So this is yet another delicate and dangerous moment.
*11:38.260- 11:40.840* :  Jeremy Bowen, ever since Joe Biden announced
*11:40.840- 11:42.660* :  that he wouldn't be running for president
*11:42.800- 11:45.360* :  in the US election in November, his vice president,
*11:45.360- 11:47.780* :  Kamala Harris, has become the party's front runner
*11:47.780- 11:48.600* :  to replace him.
*11:49.040- 11:51.060* :  Well, last night she brought her campaign to Georgia,
*11:51.480- 11:52.840* :  saying the path to the White House
*11:52.840- 11:54.420* :  runs right through this state.
*11:55.100- 11:57.300* :  Nearly a third of the population in Georgia is black
*11:57.300- 11:59.820* :  and historically, Democrats there have depended heavily
*12:00.260- 12:01.800* :  on strong turnout among them.
*12:02.200- 12:04.300* :  An ortho-america correspondent Nettael Feak
*12:04.340- 12:06.220* :  was at the rally and sent this report.
*12:11.060- 12:13.980* :  A show of political force with the spotlight
*12:13.980- 12:17.240* :  on the crucial role this battleground state of Georgia
*12:17.240- 12:19.400* :  will play in November's election.
*12:23.480- 12:26.040* :  Hip-hop star Megan the Stallion and Quavo
*12:26.040- 12:29.440* :  became the latest celebrities to endorse Kamala Harris
*12:29.440- 12:32.520* :  as she looks to become the first female president
*12:32.520- 12:33.860* :  of the United States.
*12:34.620- 12:36.820* :  Excitement continues to build for her
*12:37.240- 12:40.420* :  with thousands of people filling this stadium in Atlanta
*12:40.420- 12:41.460* :  to see her.
*12:41.560- 12:42.280* :  She's home.
*12:42.980- 12:44.500* :  You know, in the infuity as a matter of fact,
*12:44.500- 12:48.800* :  we feel it's like 2008 all over again.
*12:48.960- 12:50.040* :  2008 Barack Obama.
*12:50.040- 12:50.880* :  Absolutely.
*12:50.940- 12:52.340* :  I see it on TikTok.
*12:52.340- 12:53.320* :  I see it on Instagram.
*12:53.860- 12:57.540* :  I see my classmates' postings and my friends' postings.
*12:57.900- 13:00.140* :  Kamala Harris told the crowd that her path
*13:00.140- 13:02.600* :  to the White House runs through their state
*13:02.600- 13:05.100* :  and that she was fighting for the future
*13:05.100- 13:06.440* :  and for their freedoms.
*13:07.120- 13:11.840* :  The freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own father
*13:12.900- 13:15.620* :  and not have her government tell her mother.
*13:15.920- 13:19.920* :  This crowd was incredibly energetic during Kamala Harris' speech
*13:19.920- 13:21.940* :  interrupting her several times
*13:21.980- 13:23.760* :  to clap and chant.
*13:23.760- 13:27.820* :  Her entry into the race has given Democrats here a newfound swagger.
*13:28.140- 13:30.540* :  It seems like the peach state was out of reach
*13:30.540- 13:32.440* :  with Joe Biden as the nominee,
*13:32.440- 13:35.340* :  but they believe now it is back in play
*13:35.820- 13:38.340* :  as long as Black voters turn out to the polls.
*13:40.100- 13:42.260* :  In the last election, President Joe Biden
*13:42.260- 13:45.780* :  became the first Democrat to take this state since 1992.
*13:46.740- 13:49.820* :  Still, he won by fewer than 12,000 votes,
*13:49.820- 13:54.520* :  making Georgia the state with his narrowest margin of victory in 2020.
*13:56.160- 13:58.320* :  On this beautiful sunny day here in Midtown,
*13:58.320- 14:01.420* :  Atlanta, people are out and about shopping and eating.
*14:02.080- 14:03.480* :  And speaking to them, you know,
*14:03.480- 14:07.000* :  there are some encouraging signs for Kamala Harris' campaign,
*14:07.020- 14:11.440* :  but it's also clear that she has a lot of work to do with voters
*14:12.080- 14:14.100* :  in order to secure a win in this state.
*14:15.040- 14:18.140* :  Kenneth White says if Joe Biden stayed in the race,
*14:18.420- 14:20.320* :  he planned to sit out the election.
*14:20.920- 14:22.460* :  I probably wouldn't have voted at all.
*14:23.020- 14:25.460* :  Yeah, but now that she's up and running,
*14:25.460- 14:26.740* :  I'm going to get out and vote for sure.
*14:27.320- 14:29.360* :  How energized are you now that she's in the race?
*14:30.000- 14:32.060* :  On a scale of 110, I would say a nine.
*14:32.480- 14:33.020* :  Pretty energized.
*14:33.220- 14:34.040* :  Yeah, pretty energized.
*14:36.160- 14:37.280* :  It's different. It's refreshing.
*14:37.280- 14:38.520* :  It's something new for the country.
*14:38.980- 14:40.420* :  It's something that we genuinely need.
*14:40.860- 14:43.280* :  But Corvon Duckworth isn't as suede.
*14:43.920- 14:45.420* :  No, I haven't made up my mind yet.
*14:46.620- 14:48.580* :  Right now, I don't really have a plan to vote.
*14:48.880- 14:51.960* :  I feel like we've had people of my descent in office
*14:51.960- 14:54.680* :  who haven't done much for us.
*14:55.480- 14:59.060* :  Even local and residential level,
*14:59.560- 15:02.100* :  not really feel like politics really have,
*15:03.140- 15:04.360* :  you know, people's best interests.
*15:06.080- 15:10.620* :  And Radhika Patel, an Indian woman who has a son of Black and South Asian descent,
*15:10.620- 15:13.820* :  just like Harris, isn't focused on her background,
*15:13.820- 15:15.560* :  but rather her policies.
*15:16.000- 15:20.020* :  I'm less concerned about if they are Indian, Black, white, Chinese, Hispanic,
*15:20.020- 15:21.300* :  Mexican, it doesn't matter.
*15:21.820- 15:23.780* :  Their policy is kind of far left.
*15:24.440- 15:28.620* :  It's in great opposition to what I believe just as my personal values and my personal morals.
*15:29.700- 15:30.740* :  I believe in male and female.
*15:31.120- 15:32.580* :  I believe in a healthy economy.
*15:32.580- 15:33.600* :  I believe in healthy family.
*15:34.000- 15:36.100* :  And I just think that she is not in line.
*15:37.020- 15:40.760* :  And in a sign that Republicans are taking notice of the shift in the race,
*15:40.760- 15:44.780* :  the Trump Vance campaign just announced they will be holding a rally
*15:44.780- 15:46.780* :  at the same venue on Saturday.
*15:51.360- 15:52.920* :  Nedta Taufik in Atlanta.
*15:53.760- 15:57.660* :  The Japanese Central Bank has announced its latest interest rate decision.
*15:57.660- 16:01.400* :  And for a country which has grappled with economic stagnation for many years,
*16:01.760- 16:04.340* :  any movement, however small, is big news.
*16:04.980- 16:08.020* :  Our business correspondent, Mariko Oy, has more on the story.
*16:08.520- 16:12.060* :  Japan's rates have been near zero for so long.
*16:12.060- 16:14.300* :  They were the pioneer in cutting-raised to zero.
*16:14.780- 16:15.900* :  They even went negative.
*16:15.900- 16:19.480* :  They exited that negative rate policy back in March.
*16:19.480- 16:23.240* :  And today they raised rates to 0.25%.
*16:23.500- 16:24.320* :  So it's not that high.
*16:24.320- 16:27.920* :  Even if you are living in Japan, it's still very, very low.
*16:28.140- 16:32.360* :  They also announced that it will shrink its massive portfolio of assets that they bought
*16:32.360- 16:34.680* :  over many years of monetary stimulus.
*16:34.680- 16:39.580* :  So basically, they are trying to return to monetary policy,
*16:39.940- 16:41.680* :  you know, something closer to global norm.
*16:42.300- 16:42.980* :  Mariko Oy.
*16:45.460- 16:47.940* :  Still to come on the podcast after years of conflict,
*16:47.940- 16:52.640* :  a ceasefire deal has been agreed between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.
*17:00.440- 17:01.160* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*17:01.160- 17:05.880* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*17:05.880- 17:07.240* :  prices due to inflation.
*17:07.660- 17:08.300* :  They said yes.
*17:08.660- 17:11.240* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*17:11.280- 17:13.180* :  owners to your contracts, they said,
*17:13.180- 17:15.020* :  what the f**k are you talking about?
*17:15.040- 17:16.620* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*17:16.880- 17:20.440* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month

*17:36.980- 17:42.520* :  Olive and June gives you everything that you need for a salon quality manicure in one box.
*17:42.520- 17:47.620* :  And if you break it down, it really comes out to $2 a manicure, which is absolutely insane.

*17:51.380- 17:53.820* :  The difference between how your nails used to look

*18:23.340- 18:27.180* :  To Venezuela, where the country's main opposition leader, Maria Carina Machado,
*18:27.180- 18:31.960* :  is facing the threat of arrest following the disputed result of Sunday's presidential election.
*18:31.980- 18:34.860* :  President Nicolas Maduro was declared the winner.
*18:35.360- 18:39.640* :  The opposition say they're sure the election was stolen with their candidate, Edmondo Gonzalez,
*18:39.640- 18:44.780* :  they claim, winning 70% of the vote. Thousands gathered peacefully in the capital
*18:44.780- 18:49.580* :  Caracas on Tuesday in contrast to violent clashes which marred protests the day before.
*18:49.580- 18:53.860* :  At least 11 people have died and more than 700 protesters arrested,
*18:54.380- 18:55.720* :  including two opposition leaders.
*18:55.740- 18:59.720* :  Our correspondent Ioni Wells has more details from central Caracas.
*19:00.360- 19:05.420* :  Protests have continued, people weren't deterred by the violence that broke out your day after
*19:05.640- 19:12.440* :  the election. Thousands and thousands of people gathered in the city centre again to protest against
*19:12.440- 19:18.500* :  President Maduro and his claim to victory. It was a relatively peaceful protest on the whole.
*19:18.500- 19:23.180* :  Many people were spoke to there, were saying that they were there to defend democracy.
*19:23.180- 19:25.720* :  They believed that the election had been a fraud.
*19:25.720- 19:30.120* :  Some, though, did say that they felt the only way this would end was if the military
*19:30.120- 19:34.220* :  and the police decided to join them, the opposition against the government.
*19:34.220- 19:38.220* :  So far, the military police have been very loyal to the government.
*19:38.220- 19:41.040* :  They've been hitting back some protesters around the city,
*19:41.040- 19:44.160* :  in some cases firing tear gas and rubber bullets,
*19:44.660- 19:46.620* :  where some of those protests have escalated.
*19:46.620- 19:53.320* :  Now, there was also a gathering of protesters of Maduro supporters in another part of the city.
*19:53.680- 19:58.300* :  Some of them said that the opposition's claims that this election was a fraud untrue
*19:58.420- 19:59.900* :  and that they haven't been proved.
*20:00.600- 20:06.220* :  The opposition say that they have receipts from a majority now of the electronic voting
*20:06.220- 20:08.180* :  machines in the election.
*20:08.180- 20:13.880* :  And they argue that these receipts prove that they not President Maduro won the election.
*20:14.320- 20:17.540* :  The government, though, has accused them of instigating a coup
*20:17.980- 20:20.860* :  back in their words by US imperialism.
*20:21.480- 20:22.100* :  Ioni Wells
*20:22.760- 20:26.580* :  Instability and violence in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
*20:26.580- 20:29.460* :  has been one of the world's worst humanitarian crises,
*20:29.460- 20:32.480* :  with thousands killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.
*20:33.240- 20:35.260* :  But now there appears to have been a major breakthrough.
*20:35.660- 20:39.320* :  The foreign ministers of the DRC and Rwanda have agreed to a ceasefire,
*20:39.780- 20:40.780* :  more from Richard Hamilton.
*20:41.380- 20:45.180* :  The talks have been held in Lwanda, the Angolan capital,
*20:45.180- 20:49.840* :  in the presidential palace, because they were mediated by President Zhao Lorenzo.
*20:50.260- 20:54.840* :  They come as a humanitarian truce between the Congolese Army
*20:55.300- 21:00.320* :  and the rebel group, the M23, who was due to expire on the 3rd of August.
*21:00.880- 21:05.360* :  So it's not immediately clear if this ceasefire extends that truce.
*21:05.680- 21:07.280* :  Or whether it has a wider scope.
*21:07.780- 21:12.140* :  So we do have to be a bit cautious and previous agreements have collapsed.
*21:12.300- 21:15.500* :  But if it holds, this could be a massive deal.
*21:16.100- 21:19.360* :  Rwanda in the past has denied supporting the M23,
*21:20.040- 21:25.280* :  but the United Nations has in a report said that Kigali funded the group.
*21:25.280- 21:30.360* :  And Rwanda forces have also been accused of operating inside the DR Congo
*21:31.040- 21:32.460* :  alongside the rebels.
*21:33.020- 21:37.080* :  Now this all goes back to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda
*21:37.080- 21:40.740* :  when Hutu militia escaped across the border
*21:41.100- 21:43.540* :  into the DR Congo, which was then Zaire.
*21:44.020- 21:47.900* :  Rwanda in turn armed militias to use them as a buffer
*21:47.900- 21:52.540* :  to protect the Tutsi population and to avoid a repeat of the genocide.
*21:53.300- 21:58.700* :  The M23 was created in 2012 and it re-emerged in 2021.
*21:58.860- 22:02.780* :  They took the provincial capital Goma in the past
*22:03.140- 22:05.500* :  and at the moment the control nearby towns.
*22:06.040- 22:10.680* :  So tens of thousands have been killed and up to half a million displaced
*22:10.680- 22:12.380* :  in the last few years.
*22:13.000- 22:17.400* :  So a massive potential deal that's already been welcomed by Belgium
*22:17.400- 22:20.220* :  in the former colonial power, Richard Hamilton.
*22:20.920- 22:24.480* :  And South Africa is the latest country to welcome remote workers,
*22:24.760- 22:26.600* :  also known as digital nomads.
*22:26.940- 22:30.700* :  It's introduced a special visa to make it easier for people to work in the country,
*22:30.700- 22:35.460* :  which allows those earning more than $18,000 to stay for up to three years.
*22:36.000- 22:39.300* :  For example, with one of these visas I could go and live in South Africa
*22:39.300- 22:42.440* :  but work remotely for a company back here in the UK.
*22:43.160- 22:45.400* :  Well Cape Town is one of the most popular destinations
*22:45.400- 22:47.260* :  but locals aren't happy.
*22:47.800- 22:49.920* :  They say foreign workers are driving up prices.
*22:50.520- 22:51.400* :  Mo Ali reports.
*22:52.880- 22:56.560* :  I've come to the popular V&A waterfront in Cape Town.
*22:56.560- 22:58.760* :  It's a place called Design Studio 17
*22:58.760- 23:01.820* :  and Open Plan offers space large desk areas
*23:02.280- 23:05.580* :  where digital nomads actually have offers space to do the work.
*23:06.020- 23:07.880* :  And one of the digital nomads here today
*23:08.020- 23:10.180* :  is Oscar Murphy from Ireland.
*23:11.040- 23:15.280* :  For me, Cape Town is probably the most beautiful place in the world.
*23:15.340- 23:19.100* :  It's a city that has unparalleled access to nature.
*23:19.580- 23:22.880* :  Food is amazing, the people are super friendly and open.
*23:22.960- 23:26.000* :  Murphy is one of thousands of digital nomads
*23:26.220- 23:28.880* :  who spend part of the year working in Cape Town.
*23:29.260- 23:33.060* :  The new digital visa which was approved by government in May
*23:33.660- 23:37.160* :  allows for workers to initially remain in the country for a year.
*23:37.960- 23:39.980* :  Those who stay for more than six months
*23:40.360- 23:42.100* :  must pay local income taxes
*23:42.660- 23:46.000* :  but an exemption is available to those staying for shorter periods.
*23:46.880- 23:49.980* :  And people earning more than around $18,000
*23:50.780- 23:52.860* :  will be able to work legally in the country
*23:52.860- 23:55.160* :  for a period of up to three years.
*23:57.480- 24:00.340* :  But while Murphy and his fellow digital nomads
*24:00.340- 24:02.240* :  are having a great time in Cape Town,
*24:02.840- 24:05.980* :  many locals have complained on social media platforms
*24:05.980- 24:08.620* :  about the rising cost of rent and food
*24:09.220- 24:10.840* :  and even a change in culture.
*24:11.600- 24:13.140* :  One of the agrived Cape Townians
*24:13.140- 24:16.660* :  is as a mushy deal Benny, a digital content creator.
*24:17.040- 24:18.820* :  I don't think I could pay for rent currently
*24:19.360- 24:21.500* :  but all of my friends that are paying for rent
*24:21.500- 24:23.800* :  are currently like struggling to find good places.
*24:24.120- 24:26.920* :  Cape Town's rental costs are the highest in the country.
*24:27.020- 24:31.040* :  The average rent is around $540 a month
*24:31.040- 24:37.020* :  and prices rose by just under 4% between 2022 and 2023
*24:37.680- 24:40.460* :  according to the South African property site PayProp.
*24:40.660- 24:42.620* :  It's difficult to move even in Cape Town
*24:42.620- 24:45.140* :  because once your lease ends,
*24:45.140- 24:47.660* :  then your landlord will drive up the price
*24:47.660- 24:50.500* :  because they can and there is going to be someone
*24:50.500- 24:52.280* :  who's going to come from maybe America
*24:52.940- 24:55.020* :  looking to live for six months or a year
*24:55.220- 24:57.740* :  and they will pay the whole rent upfront.
*24:58.260- 25:00.680* :  While the Obeni says something needs to be done
*25:00.680- 25:03.080* :  to prevent locals from being disadvantaged
*25:03.080- 25:05.260* :  by favorable foreign currency,
*25:05.900- 25:08.900* :  James Foss, the City Council's executive member
*25:08.900- 25:12.340* :  for economic development believes digital nomads
*25:12.340- 25:14.540* :  are good for economic growth in Cape Town.
*25:14.980- 25:17.460* :  We have been pushing for the digital nomad visa
*25:18.140- 25:19.640* :  precisely because it will be a boon
*25:20.000- 25:21.360* :  to our local economy and jobs
*25:21.720- 25:22.620* :  but as a city government,
*25:22.620- 25:23.860* :  with our tourism partners,
*25:23.860- 25:26.720* :  we want to champion responsible tourism.
*25:27.240- 25:29.460* :  While the debate about affordable rents
*25:29.460- 25:32.140* :  and the rising prices in restaurants goes on,
*25:32.700- 25:34.980* :  the digital nomads continue to arrive
*25:34.980- 25:36.660* :  in South Africa in big numbers
*25:37.300- 25:39.700* :  as they go in search of the perfect blend
*25:40.120- 25:41.140* :  of work and play.
*25:42.020- 25:42.840* :  Mo Ali there.
*25:43.300- 25:46.080* :  Indonesia is going to introduce strict new laws
*25:46.080- 25:48.820* :  on the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products
*25:49.120- 25:50.840* :  in an effort to reduce smoking rates
*25:50.840- 25:53.500* :  and to prevent young people from taking up the habit.
*25:54.140- 25:55.660* :  cigarettes are easy to buy individually
*25:55.660- 25:56.940* :  and are very cheap.
*25:57.440- 25:58.940* :  Our Asia Pacific Regional Editor,
*25:58.940- 26:00.420* :  Celia Hatten, told us more.
*26:01.140- 26:03.740* :  Indonesia is one of only six countries in the world
*26:03.740- 26:05.820* :  where smoking rates are rising
*26:05.880- 26:07.660* :  and they're not just rising, they're exploding.
*26:07.660- 26:10.980* :  They're up 40% since the year 2000
*26:11.020- 26:14.020* :  and it's really a gendered thing in Indonesia.
*26:14.020- 26:17.140* :  So 70% of men in Indonesia smoke.
*26:17.140- 26:18.500* :  It's thought to be a way
*26:18.500- 26:20.380* :  that men kind of express their masculinity
*26:20.800- 26:23.380* :  while only 2% of women do
*26:23.420- 26:24.480* :  and you're totally right.
*26:24.480- 26:26.520* :  It's really big among young people.
*26:26.960- 26:30.860* :  So before around a third of Indonesian children
*26:31.460- 26:33.540* :  try smoking before they turn 10.
*26:33.700- 26:36.280* :  So it's a massive problem in Indonesia.
*26:36.760- 26:37.860* :  And the new regulations,
*26:37.860- 26:39.480* :  what exactly are they trying to do?
*26:39.480- 26:41.540* :  Because you can buy cigarettes individually, I believe.
*26:41.840- 26:43.960* :  Now, well, you can, but that's going to change.
*26:44.060- 26:45.780* :  So you can buy a cigarette in Indonesia
*26:45.820- 26:47.320* :  for as little as 12 cents.
*26:47.320- 26:48.320* :  So that's going to change.
*26:48.320- 26:50.240* :  You have to start buying them in packs.
*26:50.240- 26:52.460* :  That's also a way to collect more taxes, I think.
*26:52.880- 26:56.780* :  But also the smoking age is going to go up from 18 to 21
*26:56.780- 26:58.440* :  although, as I've just said,
*26:58.440- 27:00.200* :  most Indonesian children,
*27:00.580- 27:03.040* :  many Indonesian children try smoking before 10.
*27:03.240- 27:03.420* :  Knowing that already.
*27:03.580- 27:05.100* :  So yes, we're not quite sure
*27:05.100- 27:06.440* :  about how these are going to be enforced.
*27:06.440- 27:09.420* :  But they are going to try to stop vendors
*27:09.420- 27:11.360* :  from selling cigarettes near schools
*27:11.360- 27:13.340* :  or you're going to clamp down on advertising.
*27:13.740- 27:14.920* :  But you're totally right.
*27:15.040- 27:16.740* :  Critics have a lot of questions
*27:16.740- 27:18.200* :  about whether these new rules
*27:18.200- 27:19.180* :  are actually going to be enforced.
*27:19.200- 27:20.120* :  I just wonder as well,
*27:20.120- 27:21.640* :  if you bring in lots of new rules
*27:21.640- 27:22.320* :  that already,
*27:22.760- 27:23.940* :  you know, the existing situation
*27:23.940- 27:25.240* :  is not being enforced anyway.
*27:25.740- 27:27.540* :  You know, will it drive underground perhaps?
*27:27.540- 27:29.400* :  Because, you know, if you're going to make it stricter
*27:29.820- 27:30.960* :  and people still want to do it,
*27:30.960- 27:33.100* :  there's always the chance that there's a sort of a black market.
*27:33.100- 27:33.800* :  That's kind of thing.
*27:33.800- 27:35.360* :  The truth is that there's basically
*27:35.760- 27:37.620* :  the Indonesian government is fighting with itself.
*27:37.700- 27:39.280* :  So you have the Ministry of Health,
*27:39.320- 27:41.260* :  which is really starting to confront
*27:41.260- 27:43.760* :  a huge explosion in cancer rates
*27:44.220- 27:44.920* :  and lung conditions
*27:44.980- 27:47.320* :  because smoking rates are so high,
*27:47.320- 27:50.320* :  94 million people are smoking inside Indonesia.
*27:50.740- 27:53.780* :  But then you also have this really powerful tobacco industry,
*27:53.780- 27:54.760* :  which is saying, look,
*27:55.200- 27:57.180* :  we bring in billions in taxes
*27:57.180- 28:01.120* :  and also we employ around more than 600,000 people.
*28:01.120- 28:03.520* :  Now, the WHO, the World Health Organization,
*28:03.520- 28:06.440* :  says what you need to do is just charge more taxes.
*28:06.440- 28:09.000* :  So they recommend that if you buy a pack of cigarettes
*28:09.000- 28:09.820* :  around the world,
*28:10.220- 28:12.120* :  three quarters of the cost of that pack
*28:12.120- 28:13.520* :  should go towards taxes.
*28:13.880- 28:16.700* :  In Indonesia, it's around half the cost of a pack of cigarettes.
*28:16.760- 28:18.680* :  So they say, look, you really need to start
*28:18.680- 28:20.540* :  bringing in more money in taxes,
*28:20.540- 28:22.660* :  more than just the billions you already bring in.
*28:22.880- 28:24.700* :  Because you're going to have just an explosion
*28:25.200- 28:27.120* :  in healthcare problems going forward.
*28:27.760- 28:28.500* :  Celia Hatton.
*28:29.020- 28:30.580* :  Now, the old saying you have a memory
*28:30.580- 28:33.300* :  like a goldfish is usually used as an insult,
*28:33.300- 28:35.960* :  implying that someone has a pretty terrible memory.
*28:36.500- 28:38.180* :  But new research suggests that having the memory
*28:38.180- 28:39.980* :  of a goldfish might be a good thing
*28:40.300- 28:41.400* :  as Anna Aslam explains.
*28:42.300- 28:43.560* :  Many people believe goldfish
*28:43.560- 28:45.560* :  can only remember the past three seconds,
*28:45.560- 28:48.180* :  but that sounds fishy to scientists.
*28:48.880- 28:51.240* :  They argue all species need to have good memories
*28:51.240- 28:54.220* :  to find food, breed, and survive in the wild.
*28:54.820- 28:55.840* :  In his latest experiment,
*28:55.840- 28:58.180* :  Professor Colin Brown found that rainbow fish
*28:58.180- 29:00.120* :  can spot a hole in a net to escape
*29:00.600- 29:03.180* :  and recall where it is nearly a year later.
*29:03.420- 29:05.260* :  They learnt really, really quickly.
*29:05.420- 29:08.120* :  And by the end of four or five trials,
*29:08.220- 29:11.660* :  they would basically be swimming calmly in front of the net
*29:12.200- 29:14.300* :  and about halfway down the aquarium.
*29:14.360- 29:15.760* :  They would literally do a U-turn
*29:15.760- 29:17.140* :  and swim directly through the hole.
*29:17.940- 29:18.960* :  About 11 months later,
*29:19.520- 29:21.320* :  I put them back in the same apparatus
*29:21.320- 29:22.520* :  and tested them again.
*29:23.380- 29:26.920* :  And they continued at the pace that they'd left off.
*29:27.400- 29:28.040* :  It was incredible.
*29:28.520- 29:30.300* :  It's not the first experiment to suggest
*29:30.300- 29:31.500* :  fish have good memories,
*29:32.020- 29:33.680* :  although we seem to keep forgetting.
*29:33.680- 29:35.740* :  Professor Brown described the idea
*29:35.740- 29:37.780* :  of a three-second memory as nuts.
*29:38.220- 29:40.600* :  It kind of gives us an excuse to treat them poorly,
*29:40.660- 29:43.880* :  because if we have a low opinion of their intelligence,
*29:43.880- 29:47.000* :  then perhaps we can abuse them and get away with it.
*29:47.180- 29:49.060* :  Past experiments have found that zebrafish
*29:49.060- 29:51.280* :  can recognize their own faces in reflections.
*29:51.340- 29:54.580* :  And African cyclists can remember things for 12 days.
*29:55.340- 29:56.700* :  Other species hunt together,
*29:57.120- 29:58.160* :  protect each other from predators,
*29:58.160- 30:00.860* :  return to breeding grounds after years away at sea,
*30:00.860- 30:03.660* :  and clean other fish in exchange for not being eaten.
*30:04.300- 30:06.440* :  And the humble goldfish is no exception.
*30:06.960- 30:08.800* :  It's been found they can escape mazes,
*30:09.100- 30:10.340* :  learn tricks, make friends,
*30:10.340- 30:12.160* :  accurately estimate distances,
*30:12.760- 30:15.200* :  and one study even taught them how to drive a car,
*30:15.720- 30:18.620* :  which they manage to do better than some humans at rush hour.
*30:19.360- 30:20.260* :  Probably better than me.
*30:20.320- 30:22.740* :  I think I can just about remember that was Anna Aslam.
*30:25.700- 30:26.540* :  That's all from us for now.
*30:26.540- 30:29.600* :  There will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.
*30:29.700- 30:31.340* :  If you'd like to comment though on this podcast
*30:31.340- 30:32.660* :  and the topics that we cover,
*30:33.040- 30:33.880* :  do send us an email.
*30:33.880- 30:38.420* :  Our address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*30:38.420- 30:39.820* :  We love hearing from you.
*30:40.040- 30:42.920* :  You can also find us on x at Global NewsPod.
*30:43.500- 30:45.260* :  This edition was mixed by Jack Wilfam.
*30:45.260- 30:46.600* :  The producer was Oliver Burlow.
*30:46.940- 30:48.340* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*30:48.900- 30:49.680* :  I'm Chris Barrow.
*30:49.680- 30:51.100* :  Until next time, goodbye.
*30:59.660- 31:01.820* :  He was a kind of vigilante killer.
*31:01.820- 31:06.180* :  He killed at least 19 people during the 1980s in South Africa.
*31:06.560- 31:07.480* :  Very dark times.
*31:08.020- 31:09.020* :  People were desperate.
*31:09.480- 31:10.620* :  We were looking for him.
*31:10.760- 31:11.960* :  We couldn't find him.
*31:12.280- 31:13.660* :  And nobody knew where he was.
*31:14.500- 31:16.940* :  Every single one of his victims was black.
*31:17.780- 31:20.580* :  In each such a state where he was now hunting.
