*01:19.880- 01:23.560* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.720- 01:30.460* :  I'm Jackie Leonard, and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday 11 July, these are our main stories.
*01:31.000- 01:36.140* :  China fiercely rejects accusations from NATO that its prolonging Russia's war in Ukraine.
*01:36.760- 01:41.620* :  Jewish people report a spike in anti-Semitism across the EU since the start of the war in
*01:41.620- 01:47.340* :  Gaza last October, and more cases of a new strain of epochs are discovered in the Democratic
*01:47.340- 01:48.400* :  Republic of Congo.
*01:51.280- 01:56.920* :  So in this podcast, why are so many of Nigeria's best and brightest young minds trying to leave?
*01:57.460- 02:02.520* :  And I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem within the International
*02:02.520- 02:07.720* :  Space Station, we can get in our spacecraft, undock, talk to our team, and figure out the
*02:07.720- 02:08.780* :  best way to come home.
*02:09.080- 02:13.880* :  The cool, calm astronauts currently stranded in space, but unfazed.
*02:19.740- 02:25.460* :  China has fiercely rejected NATO leaders claim that its enabling Russia's war in Ukraine.
*02:25.620- 02:30.720* :  It said the NATO gathering meeting in Washington was hyping up Beijing's involvement.
*02:31.320- 02:36.340* :  The gathering initially focused on NATO member support for Ukraine, but then moved on to China's
*02:36.340- 02:41.060* :  role in the conflict, prompting this response from foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian.
*02:44.260- 02:49.540* :  The declaration of the NATO summit exaggerated the tension in the Asia-Pacific region.
*02:49.540- 02:55.940* :  It was full of cold-war mentality and belligant rhetoric, and the content related to China
*02:55.940- 02:59.000* :  was full of bias, smears, and provocations.
*02:59.660- 03:02.700* :  We strongly deplore and resolutions oppose this.
*03:04.260- 03:10.060* :  Strong words then from Beijing, but its NATO's criticism justified a question for our Asia-Pacific
*03:10.060- 03:11.800* :  regional editor, Mickey Bristow.
*03:12.180- 03:16.480* :  Well, there is certainly a disconnect between what China says and what it does.
*03:16.960- 03:18.440* :  And I'll give you just a couple of examples.
*03:18.500- 03:20.400* :  Firstly, there's trade with Russia.
*03:20.900- 03:26.500* :  Over the last couple of years, since Russia invaded Ukraine, that trade has increased massively.
*03:26.500- 03:33.540* :  So China is buying oil and gas from Russia and selling it consumer goods, which Western
*03:34.040- 03:35.820* :  companies no longer want to sell it.
*03:35.820- 03:40.840* :  Also, dual-use technology, this is technology that can be used for civilian purposes or for
*03:40.840- 03:41.720* :  military purposes.
*03:41.720- 03:47.200* :  China sells Russia that kind of technology, also provides diplomatic support for Russia.
*03:48.040- 03:53.400* :  So really, it's hard not to come to the conclusion that certainly Russia's war in Ukraine would
*03:53.400- 03:58.700* :  be a lot more difficult if China was not providing that kind of support.
*03:58.700- 04:02.800* :  So yes, in that sense, NATO does have some justification.
*04:03.800- 04:07.600* :  NATO is also concerned about Taiwan, isn't it?
*04:07.620- 04:11.260* :  How is China likely to react to that?
*04:11.920- 04:17.000* :  Yeah, NATO is concerned about Taiwan, not because it has any military obligations towards Taiwan.
*04:17.000- 04:22.520* :  Taiwan isn't a member of NATO, but it fears, generally, it's an example.
*04:23.140- 04:27.880* :  China's military pressure on Taiwan and Ireland, it thinks it's its own territory,
*04:28.540- 04:30.800* :  is another indication of China's assertiveness.
*04:30.800- 04:35.120* :  It's willingness to undermine global order and global rules.
*04:35.300- 04:36.780* :  And so that's why it's concerned.
*04:36.780- 04:41.360* :  It's also concerned because any conflict over Taiwan might draw in the United States
*04:41.360- 04:47.600* :  and NATO member, and just to underscore that concern, just in the last 24 hours, China
*04:47.600- 04:51.480* :  has sent 66 warplanes around Taiwan.
*04:51.480- 04:54.300* :  So it gives you an indication of China's military pressure.
*04:54.900- 04:56.680* :  It's keeping up on Taiwan.
*04:57.200- 04:59.160* :  You ask there how is China likely to react?
*04:59.580- 05:04.420* :  China doesn't engage with outsiders talking about Taiwan in the least.
*05:04.760- 05:09.460* :  It considers Taiwan its own territory and doesn't want to engage in any discussion.
*05:09.540- 05:14.200* :  In fact, it's one NATO to keep out of East Asia, interestingly, though.
*05:14.200- 05:15.940* :  At the same time, all this is going on.
*05:15.940- 05:22.320* :  Chinese troops are right over in Europe, in Belarus, taking part in a military exercise.
*05:22.320- 05:25.520* :  So whilst China on one hand is saying, keep out of East Asia,
*05:26.160- 05:30.380* :  it's been involved, or getting involved in European affairs.
*05:30.380- 05:35.980* :  So quite an interesting confluence of events taking place all at the same time.
*05:36.540- 05:37.440* :  That was Mickey Bristo.
*05:37.980- 05:41.780* :  Russia, meanwhile, has reportedly said that Moscow will need to act
*05:41.780- 05:45.060* :  to contain the very serious threat from NATO.
*05:45.620- 05:49.580* :  The TAS news agency has quoted the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov
*05:49.580- 05:54.800* :  saying that the Western military alliance is now fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine.
*05:55.500- 05:57.180* :  Steve Rosenberg is our Moscow correspondent.
*05:57.860- 06:00.240* :  There's no real sense of surprise in Moscow.
*06:00.240- 06:06.940* :  The Russians had expected the NATO summit to announce more aid, more military assistance for Ukraine.
*06:06.940- 06:11.760* :  But certainly, Russian officials are expressing their anger at what has been announced.
*06:12.700- 06:15.960* :  Yesterday, the foreign ministry spokesperson, Mary Zakharova,
*06:16.640- 06:18.740* :  said that Washington heads the gang of war.
*06:19.360- 06:23.480* :  And today, we heard the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov
*06:23.960- 06:28.840* :  saying Russia's opponents in Europe and America do not support dialogue or peace
*06:29.500- 06:33.480* :  and accusing Western leaders of seeking Russia's strategic defeat.
*06:33.480- 06:38.280* :  Moscow, he said, would respond with coordinated measures to keep NATO in check.
*06:38.700- 06:41.400* :  Now, this is the official narrative here, right?
*06:41.400- 06:45.520* :  It has been for some time that Russia is a besieged fortress
*06:45.520- 06:48.680* :  threatened by all kinds of external forces,
*06:48.680- 06:52.640* :  enemies abroad who are plotting to destroy the Russian Federation.
*06:53.120- 06:56.900* :  And this narrative is used regularly here, I would say,
*06:57.300- 06:59.540* :  to try to rally the Russian people around the government
*06:59.540- 07:02.540* :  and maintain public support for President Putin.
*07:02.540- 07:05.620* :  And that includes Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.
*07:06.180- 07:08.660* :  And coordinated measures to keep NATO in check.
*07:08.660- 07:09.980* :  What might those look like?
*07:10.460- 07:12.860* :  Well, Mr. Peskov didn't spell those out.
*07:12.860- 07:19.420* :  He said that Russian officials would study carefully the decisions of the NATO summit
*07:19.420- 07:22.600* :  and they would reach conclusions and decide what to do.
*07:22.600- 07:25.640* :  So Russia not actually going into details here.
*07:26.160- 07:29.440* :  But in recent weeks, certain Russian officials have suggested
*07:29.440- 07:34.800* :  that Moscow might alter, might tweak its so-called nuclear doctrine.
*07:34.820- 07:40.340* :  And that sort of lists the occasions under which Russia would use nuclear weapons.
*07:40.360- 07:41.980* :  Now, I'm not saying that's going to happen,
*07:42.400- 07:44.440* :  but Mr. Peskov referred to it again today.
*07:44.960- 07:45.940* :  I think we'll have to wait and see.
*07:46.060- 07:47.780* :  It's important to point out as well, Jackie,
*07:47.780- 07:51.660* :  that NATO insists that it is a defensive alliance, right?
*07:51.660- 07:54.720* :  That it is simply responding to Russia's actions.
*07:54.840- 07:57.940* :  Because there's no doubt that President Putin's decision
*07:57.940- 08:01.920* :  to launch that full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago
*08:01.920- 08:07.340* :  spots a lot of concern amongst Russia's neighbors and across Europe.
*08:07.700- 08:10.260* :  And just finally, Steve, we've also heard some fairly strong words
*08:10.260- 08:12.860* :  from Demetri Medvedev about Ukraine and NATO.
*08:13.720- 08:14.240* :  Yeah, that's right.
*08:14.240- 08:17.500* :  Well, if you follow Mr. Medvedev on social media,
*08:17.500- 08:20.180* :  you know that he quite likes strong words.
*08:20.400- 08:24.580* :  And he posted today a message saying that Russia should ensure
*08:24.580- 08:27.280* :  that the irreversible path of Ukraine to NATO
*08:27.980- 08:31.100* :  ends either with the disappearance of Ukraine or NATO
*08:31.640- 08:32.720* :  or better still both.
*08:33.660- 08:34.980* :  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.
*08:36.300- 08:39.100* :  The appeal of one of Russia's most prominent human rights
*08:39.100- 08:42.000* :  campaigners has been rejected by a court in Moscow.
*08:42.500- 08:45.620* :  Oleg Orlov was jailed in February for two and a half years
*08:46.020- 08:47.800* :  for speaking out against the war in Ukraine.
*08:48.480- 08:52.420* :  In court today, the 71-year-old said he had no remorse or regrets.
*08:52.540- 08:56.920* :  Speaking by video link from a prison, Mr. Orlov quoted a prosecutor
*08:56.920- 08:59.600* :  from the Nuremberg Trials of German Nazis
*09:00.220- 09:02.200* :  to describe Russia's judicial system.
*09:05.940- 09:08.820* :  It's a fairly scratchy line, but what he's saying is they distorted,
*09:08.820- 09:13.660* :  perverted, and finally achieved the total destruction of justice and laws.
*09:13.780- 09:18.260* :  They made the judicial system an indispensable part of the dictatorship.
*09:19.060- 09:22.540* :  Our Europe editor, Charles Havelin, told us more about Mr. Orlov
*09:22.540- 09:23.820* :  and why he was jailed.
*09:24.120- 09:27.740* :  71-years-old is an absolutely veteran rights campaigner.
*09:28.220- 09:31.500* :  Memorial is the name of the group that he headed for two decades.
*09:32.320- 09:35.160* :  And the clue to that is in the name, it was set up to memorialize
*09:35.160- 09:39.460* :  and remember the victims of rights repression in Russia,
*09:40.080- 09:42.340* :  including during the long communist era.
*09:43.360- 09:48.040* :  But he had also become a more general critic of Vladimir Putin's Russia,
*09:48.300- 09:50.760* :  criticizing, for instance, the situation in the Northern Caucasus,
*09:50.760- 09:51.920* :  Chechnya, et cetera.
*09:53.340- 09:57.140* :  And he was in jail for an article he'd written in French media
*09:58.060- 10:00.280* :  as he alluded to criticizing the war in Ukraine,
*10:00.280- 10:04.040* :  something he said had resulted in the mass killing of civilians,
*10:04.980- 10:07.040* :  something that Moscow, of course, denies,
*10:07.460- 10:13.100* :  but also blamed Vladimir Putin for leading Russia into fascism.
*10:13.960- 10:16.180* :  Well, his appeal has been rejected.
*10:16.180- 10:17.580* :  What was said in court?
*10:18.200- 10:22.100* :  Well, his remarks in court, we heard from him just then,
*10:22.100- 10:24.560* :  quoting from the prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials.
*10:25.460- 10:26.660* :  He also said, very defiantly,
*10:26.660- 10:28.920* :  I do not regret or repent anything.
*10:28.920- 10:30.780* :  I'm in the right place at the right time,
*10:30.780- 10:33.720* :  and I'm helping to draw attention to mass repression.
*10:34.440- 10:36.280* :  And rather humorously, at one point,
*10:36.320- 10:38.460* :  he suggested that those in the courtroom
*10:38.980- 10:42.220* :  while waiting for the judge to come back with the verdict.
*10:42.220- 10:45.140* :  He said, why don't you go and have a drink for my health
*10:45.600- 10:46.480* :  once the trial's over?
*10:46.540- 10:48.120* :  And he said, there is excellent chacha
*10:48.120- 10:49.440* :  at the place across the street,
*10:49.900- 10:52.000* :  referring to a Georgian type of brandy.
*10:52.520- 10:53.660* :  So a lot of humor there,
*10:54.600- 10:57.220* :  and seemingly a lot of resilience
*10:57.960- 11:00.360* :  when he was asked after the verdict,
*11:00.400- 11:01.960* :  if he had understood it, by his lawyer,
*11:01.960- 11:04.300* :  he said, why bother listening to them?
*11:05.060- 11:07.500* :  And as far as we know, is this it for him
*11:07.500- 11:10.020* :  or are there any more appeals open to him?
*11:10.400- 11:12.820* :  I'm sure that if there are lines of appeal open,
*11:12.820- 11:15.020* :  he will want to appeal.
*11:15.540- 11:17.300* :  And of course, bear in mind that Kremlin critics
*11:17.300- 11:19.080* :  have not had an easy time of it recently.
*11:19.100- 11:21.680* :  Nearly all of them are either jailed or exiled.
*11:22.220- 11:24.620* :  And just this week, we've been hearing of the situation
*11:24.680- 11:27.700* :  of Vladimir Karamurza, who's serving a longer prison sentence.
*11:28.480- 11:31.020* :  25 years also for what the authorities
*11:31.020- 11:32.620* :  called discrediting the war in Ukraine.
*11:33.380- 11:34.900* :  His lawyers say he's in okay health
*11:34.900- 11:38.220* :  after having been denied access to him for six days,
*11:38.940- 11:40.260* :  and they're very concerned about his health.
*11:40.260- 11:42.840* :  He says he's now been poisoned twice by the authorities.
*11:43.380- 11:47.100* :  And of course, everyone remembers the death of Alexei Navalny,
*11:47.100- 11:49.600* :  who was built as the chief critic of the Kremlin,
*11:50.140- 11:53.580* :  died in February, in a penal colony in Siberia,
*11:53.580- 11:55.040* :  in very murky circumstances.
*11:55.800- 11:56.920* :  That was Charles Haveland.
*11:57.440- 11:59.880* :  The authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*12:00.320- 12:02.500* :  so that they've detected 25 new cases
*12:02.500- 12:04.240* :  of a new strain of m-porks,
*12:04.580- 12:06.880* :  following an outbreak in the eastern city of Goma.
*12:07.320- 12:09.260* :  Congolese officials say there have been
*12:09.260- 12:12.080* :  more than 11,000 cases of m-porks this year,
*12:12.440- 12:13.940* :  and more than 400 deaths.
*12:14.360- 12:17.380* :  Neighboring countries have heightened surveillance at their borders.
*12:18.100- 12:19.740* :  Our correspondent, Richard HaGoa,
*12:19.740- 12:22.560* :  explained why this variant of m-porks is different.
*12:23.120- 12:26.840* :  Proliminary analysis that's been done by one of the researcher
*12:26.840- 12:31.680* :  institutes that is based in the eastern Congo says that the strain,
*12:31.700- 12:34.220* :  it's difficult to detect initially,
*12:34.880- 12:38.380* :  because most of the carriers are asymptomatic.
*12:38.980- 12:41.780* :  But the ability for it to spread rapidly,
*12:41.780- 12:44.360* :  especially within a set up like eastern Congo,
*12:44.360- 12:46.960* :  where most of the people who have been affected
*12:46.960- 12:51.060* :  live in crowded camps, hosting thousands and thousands of people
*12:51.520- 12:52.640* :  who have fled the conflict.
*12:52.640- 12:54.180* :  So they're indicating so far,
*12:54.680- 12:56.800* :  is the ability for it not to be detected
*12:56.800- 12:58.520* :  and for it to be spread rapidly.
*12:59.080- 13:00.600* :  And given those factors,
*13:00.660- 13:03.040* :  what can the authorities do about it?
*13:03.340- 13:04.060* :  I think at the moment,
*13:04.060- 13:06.300* :  despite the fact that there have been vaccines
*13:06.300- 13:07.460* :  that have been on trial,
*13:07.460- 13:10.520* :  and they're not really available at the moment,
*13:11.020- 13:14.560* :  because of the challenges that do come with the approval processes.
*13:15.040- 13:17.500* :  I think what the authorities there can do right now
*13:17.520- 13:19.280* :  is just to create a public awareness
*13:19.280- 13:23.020* :  and also insist on the improvement of hygiene.
*13:23.460- 13:25.400* :  I think that would be very critical
*13:25.400- 13:28.520* :  because a lot of people perhaps then would be carrying the disease
*13:29.000- 13:31.240* :  and they may not know it from the very onset.
*13:31.300- 13:33.120* :  And I think that would be very critical
*13:33.580- 13:35.160* :  in terms of other containment measures.
*13:35.600- 13:36.800* :  That was Richard Kaguay.
*13:37.860- 13:40.280* :  A survey of Jewish people in EU countries
*13:40.280- 13:42.000* :  has found that they continue to report
*13:42.000- 13:44.340* :  facing high levels of anti-semitism.
*13:44.760- 13:46.900* :  It was carried out by the European Union's
*13:46.900- 13:48.540* :  fundamental rights agency.
*13:49.040- 13:51.980* :  And it says anti-semitism has dramatically worsened
*13:52.300- 13:53.960* :  since the Hamas attacks on Israel
*13:53.960- 13:56.680* :  and the start of the war in Gaza last October.
*13:57.220- 13:59.740* :  Our Vienna correspondent, Bethany Bell, told us more.
*14:00.300- 14:05.380* :  This is a study of 8,000 Jews in 13 countries
*14:05.380- 14:09.560* :  across the EU, including Germany, France, Austria, Hungary.
*14:10.140- 14:13.500* :  The countries where there is the largest Jewish populations
*14:13.500- 14:14.660* :  in the EU.
*14:15.300- 14:20.780* :  The actual survey took place before the October 7th attacks
*14:20.780- 14:21.780* :  by Hamas.
*14:22.220- 14:26.080* :  But even before that, the survey reported
*14:26.080- 14:30.840* :  that many Jews, 62% saw the Israeli Arab-Israeli conflict
*14:30.840- 14:32.480* :  as infecting their safety.
*14:33.080- 14:35.400* :  And the director of the report said
*14:35.400- 14:37.840* :  that they held consultations with Jewish groups
*14:37.840- 14:42.240* :  after the October 7th attacks and said
*14:42.280- 14:44.700* :  that the spillover effect of the conflict
*14:44.700- 14:48.140* :  of the Middle East was eroding hard-fought rights
*14:48.140- 14:50.420* :  in tackling anti-semitism in Europe.
*14:50.840- 14:53.300* :  And what sort of examples of anti-semitism
*14:53.300- 14:54.280* :  were given in the survey?
*14:54.460- 14:59.120* :  96% said that they'd encountered anti-semitism
*14:59.560- 15:01.820* :  even before the October 7th attacks.
*15:02.300- 15:04.000* :  They said that there was a great deal
*15:04.000- 15:07.040* :  of anti-semitism, particularly online.
*15:07.040- 15:10.340* :  90% of respondents said that they'd encountered
*15:10.340- 15:11.940* :  anti-semitism online.
*15:12.500- 15:17.220* :  About 50% or so had encountered anti-semitism offline
*15:17.220- 15:18.760* :  from people that they knew.
*15:19.260- 15:21.780* :  Many people said that they continued to worry
*15:21.780- 15:26.640* :  for their own safety, over 50% worrying for their own safety
*15:26.640- 15:29.820* :  and 60% worrying for their family safety.
*15:29.820- 15:32.040* :  And that, according to the report,
*15:32.040- 15:37.040* :  has just increased since the 7th of October attacks
*15:37.220- 15:39.480* :  where they said there'd been a dramatic surge
*15:39.940- 15:42.680* :  in anti-semitic attacks and in the sense
*15:42.680- 15:45.480* :  of security concerns among Jewish people in Europe.
*15:46.180- 15:47.520* :  That was Bethany Bell in Vienna.
*15:49.040- 15:50.460* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*15:51.060- 15:54.540* :  He can't seem to make the case and get through this noise.
*15:55.080- 15:58.140* :  And secondly, this issue of diminished capacity
*15:58.540- 15:59.940* :  is just going to continue.
*16:00.460- 16:03.220* :  A US pollster on why he thinks Joe Biden
*16:03.220- 16:06.280* :  might be off the ballot at November's presidential election.
*16:13.560- 16:17.180* :  Why are so many of Nigeria's young people trying to leave?
*16:17.760- 16:20.060* :  It's become so common there's even a word for it,
*16:20.340- 16:20.720* :  Japa.
*16:21.300- 16:22.820* :  Our reporter, Hannah Gelbart,
*16:22.840- 16:24.980* :  has been speaking to students in Lagos
*16:24.980- 16:26.760* :  about what Japa means for them
*16:27.360- 16:28.720* :  and what it means for the country
*16:28.720- 16:29.800* :  they're trying to leave behind.
*16:30.720- 16:31.460* :  What's Japa?
*16:32.160- 16:35.140* :  Is when you try to move out of the country.
*16:35.360- 16:37.720* :  Running away when everything else seems
*16:37.720- 16:39.620* :  to be in no working in the community.
*16:40.000- 16:42.920* :  If I say I want to Japa, I want to leave here.
*16:42.920- 16:43.980* :  I don't want to be here anymore.
*16:44.520- 16:46.640* :  Students here at the University of Lagos
*16:46.860- 16:48.320* :  are facing a difficult choice
*16:48.680- 16:51.460* :  and it can be summed up in that one word, Japa.
*16:52.060- 16:54.080* :  It means to escape and increasingly,
*16:54.080- 16:57.020* :  it's become shorthand for leaving Nigeria altogether.
*16:57.480- 16:59.120* :  The standard of leaving here is kind of low,
*16:59.260- 17:01.100* :  so people believe outside the country
*17:01.100- 17:03.000* :  is far, far better than those leaving here.
*17:03.380- 17:04.940* :  After school, I hope I get there.
*17:05.020- 17:06.540* :  I chuck them off from this country.
*17:06.800- 17:08.940* :  Are there things here that you would want to leave behind?
*17:09.340- 17:12.280* :  In security, the state of how it is with electricity
*17:12.280- 17:13.980* :  which is not always so great.
*17:14.580- 17:15.100* :  The economy.
*17:16.000- 17:17.600* :  Many of the students and young professionals
*17:17.600- 17:19.620* :  I've spoken to are considering Japa.
*17:20.060- 17:22.520* :  And last year, Nigeria's Immigration Service
*17:22.520- 17:25.940* :  issued a record number of passports, 1.9 million.
*17:26.420- 17:29.960* :  The UK, US and Canada are some of the most popular destinations.
*17:29.960- 17:34.380* :  And the UK government says the number of Nigerians granted work visas
*17:34.380- 17:36.360* :  has quadrupled since 2019.
*17:37.280- 17:39.420* :  How easy is it to, Japa, once you decide
*17:39.420- 17:40.460* :  that's what you want to do?
*17:41.160- 17:42.380* :  Well, it's not easy.
*17:42.880- 17:45.980* :  The exchange rate is really hitting on a lot of us.
*17:46.420- 17:48.360* :  That's going to cost like a lot.
*17:48.940- 17:52.060* :  It's expensive to leave, but with the fluctuating Naira,
*17:52.300- 17:53.660* :  it's not cheap to stay either.
*17:54.160- 17:56.280* :  A mean at is a market stall owner in Lagos.
*17:56.740- 17:58.500* :  How much is this cup of your rice?
*17:58.760- 18:02.940* :  This used to be like one, five, even less than that,
*18:02.940- 18:04.760* :  but now it's 2,200.
*18:05.640- 18:08.660* :  The rising prices mean some shops here have had to close down.
*18:08.660- 18:11.760* :  And the economy is one of the main reasons for Japa.
*18:12.140- 18:13.440* :  Is it something you've ever thought about?
*18:14.280- 18:16.820* :  Yes, several with my family.
*18:17.560- 18:21.140* :  But even the increase in dollar now affects so many people.
*18:21.360- 18:24.200* :  You want to Japa and the budget is like 17 million.
*18:24.880- 18:26.980* :  There are also concerns for those left behind.
*18:27.580- 18:30.600* :  The bulk of people going are IT and healthcare professionals.
*18:30.600- 18:33.180* :  The Nigerian Medical Association says
*18:33.180- 18:36.320* :  at least 50 doctors leave the country every single week.
*18:36.740- 18:39.740* :  The government says it'll train more people up to fill the gaps.
*18:40.220- 18:43.400* :  And many of those who Japa are determined to come back.
*18:43.640- 18:46.680* :  I want to go and learn more, expand myself
*18:46.680- 18:48.060* :  and gain to my national freedom.
*18:48.140- 18:50.660* :  Maybe they'll come back because I really love this place.
*18:50.780- 18:51.640* :  I love Nigeria.
*18:52.380- 18:55.880* :  Yes, I wish I could come back because I was born and brought up here.
*18:56.260- 18:57.620* :  I'm proud to be in Nigeria.
*18:59.040- 19:01.340* :  Students in Lagos speaking to Hannah Gelbart.
*19:02.560- 19:05.980* :  There's been a huge focus on President Biden in the last few days.
*19:05.980- 19:09.240* :  As calls for him to stand down as the Democratic Party candidate
*19:09.240- 19:11.460* :  in November's presidential race grow.
*19:12.120- 19:14.740* :  Filme star Michael Douglas has added his voice
*19:14.800- 19:17.540* :  to those urging the 81-year-old to step aside.
*19:17.540- 19:21.220* :  His comments came after actor and fundraiser George Clooney
*19:21.420- 19:24.200* :  called for a fresh face to challenge for the top job
*19:24.540- 19:25.680* :  at the upcoming election.
*19:26.460- 19:28.240* :  So what are the odds that might happen?
*19:28.680- 19:30.400* :  My colleague, Catherine Bjarra Hanger,
*19:30.400- 19:33.800* :  put that to the U.S. pollster and author John Zogby.
*19:34.260- 19:38.680* :  He does very well in a scripted situation, very forceful
*19:39.300- 19:41.680* :  in his two state-of-the-union messages
*19:42.020- 19:45.740* :  and the very forceful opening of the NATO summit.
*19:46.640- 19:48.620* :  So he has that capacity.
*19:48.660- 19:54.000* :  It's when he's off-script that sometimes he shows his age,
*19:54.700- 19:59.740* :  shows some incapacity mentally, whatever it is.
*20:00.600- 20:02.280* :  During the debate with Donald Trump,
*20:02.280- 20:05.280* :  51 million people saw what they saw
*20:05.280- 20:07.300* :  and they're not going to unsee it.
*20:07.720- 20:08.700* :  They're not going to unsee it.
*20:08.700- 20:11.400* :  And we've had reaction from my listeners all around the world.
*20:11.760- 20:15.740* :  So for example, we have Chileshye Muffel-Liarra from Zambia.
*20:15.740- 20:18.300* :  He says, old age is a sign of wisdom.
*20:18.300- 20:20.760* :  People should leave Biden alone.
*20:20.760- 20:23.400* :  We also have another comment from a listener
*20:23.400- 20:24.480* :  who didn't share their name.
*20:24.480- 20:27.860* :  But he said, ever since the Democrats started tearing themselves
*20:27.860- 20:30.780* :  to shreds over the suitability of President Biden,
*20:31.240- 20:34.180* :  Trump for office, Trump's silence over the issues
*20:34.180- 20:38.260* :  becoming so loud that Americans are beginning to listen to it.
*20:38.260- 20:40.040* :  What do you make of those points?
*20:41.620- 20:43.980* :  I'll be 76 in a couple of months.
*20:43.980- 20:46.580* :  So I don't have any problem with old age whatsoever.
*20:47.140- 20:49.200* :  I'm not even saying that an 81-year-old
*20:49.200- 20:50.980* :  could not be president of the United States,
*20:50.980- 20:55.340* :  but it's clear that Mr. Biden has his difficulties.
*20:55.340- 20:57.540* :  I don't know what the diagnoses are,
*20:58.060- 21:01.120* :  but reporters have been talking about this.
*21:01.120- 21:03.360* :  Folks that meet with him have been talking about this
*21:03.420- 21:04.040* :  for a while.
*21:04.500- 21:06.600* :  And now is the campaign heats up.
*21:06.620- 21:08.220* :  Everybody's getting to see it.
*21:08.640- 21:11.880* :  In addition to that, he not only has a responsibility
*21:11.880- 21:14.180* :  to himself and his own legacy,
*21:14.840- 21:17.920* :  but he has a responsibility to try to win
*21:17.920- 21:21.960* :  and try to do his best to help Congressmen, U.S. Senators
*21:21.960- 21:24.800* :  who wear tight races, win re-election,
*21:25.220- 21:27.500* :  and you're hearing from these folks.
*21:27.520- 21:32.380* :  Some have spoken up publicly, most notably Nancy Pelosi,
*21:32.380- 21:37.280* :  the highly respected Democrat former speaker of the House,
*21:37.800- 21:40.400* :  saying Mr. Biden needs to make a decision.
*21:41.000- 21:43.700* :  And soon, and yet he's already made a decision,
*21:44.020- 21:45.120* :  which he's saying, in effect,
*21:45.720- 21:47.200* :  while the NATO leaders are here,
*21:47.580- 21:49.400* :  is that I don't like that decision.
*21:49.780- 21:50.960* :  You have to reconsider.
*21:51.600- 21:53.540* :  And John, you've been poiling the American public
*21:53.540- 21:54.660* :  for decades now.
*21:55.340- 21:56.700* :  How do you think this is playing out
*21:56.700- 21:58.020* :  with people on the ground?
*21:59.040- 22:00.520* :  Well, it's a very competitive race,
*22:00.660- 22:03.540* :  but remember it's competitive because Donald Trump
*22:03.540- 22:05.400* :  is not a beloved figure, you know?
*22:05.840- 22:09.780* :  70% have said that they don't want either Biden or Trump
*22:10.220- 22:11.060* :  as their candidates.
*22:11.060- 22:14.620* :  Now, since the debate, 80% of voters are saying
*22:15.140- 22:18.640* :  that they don't want Joe Biden in the race.
*22:18.640- 22:22.660* :  That includes 44% of his own democratic voters.
*22:23.300- 22:25.840* :  Those are really compelling and troublesome numbers
*22:26.420- 22:27.160* :  for the president.
*22:27.440- 22:28.980* :  In this kind of instance,
*22:29.620- 22:32.380* :  possible, probable, diminished capacity,
*22:33.080- 22:35.300* :  and yet a president who refuses to leave,
*22:35.900- 22:38.060* :  this is something we've never seen before.
*22:38.780- 22:41.720* :  And what's your assessment of how this is going to play out
*22:41.720- 22:43.320* :  in the months going ahead?
*22:43.840- 22:46.020* :  Well, the Democrats are going to need a new face.
*22:46.600- 22:48.460* :  And Mr. Biden, ironically,
*22:48.460- 22:52.020* :  has a strong domestic record to run on.
*22:52.340- 22:55.540* :  It's just that he can't seem to make the case
*22:55.860- 22:57.100* :  and get through this noise.
*22:57.620- 23:00.700* :  And secondly, this issue of diminished capacity
*23:01.080- 23:03.300* :  is just going to continue with him.
*23:03.300- 23:04.320* :  Here we are tonight.
*23:04.320- 23:06.840* :  We're talking about what about his performance tomorrow?
*23:06.840- 23:08.620* :  Do you think he'll rise to the occasion?
*23:09.040- 23:11.740* :  We're going to have that same conversation in October.
*23:12.240- 23:14.380* :  So you think he needs to do this step aside?
*23:14.920- 23:17.400* :  I believe the numbers weren't it.
*23:17.400- 23:19.780* :  And I think that actually that's going to happen.
*23:20.680- 23:23.220* :  US pollster and author John Zogby.
*23:23.880- 23:24.880* :  Now, we've all been there.
*23:24.880- 23:26.220* :  The train breaks down.
*23:26.220- 23:27.280* :  The bus is late.
*23:27.540- 23:28.900* :  Your car gets a puncture.
*23:29.320- 23:33.120* :  Spare a thought, though, for Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore.
*23:33.220- 23:35.780* :  It was on June 5th that they blasted off
*23:36.040- 23:37.700* :  for what was supposed to be an eight-day trip
*23:37.720- 23:39.320* :  to the International Space Station.
*23:39.800- 23:42.460* :  But the spacecraft which brought them there made by Boeing
*23:42.800- 23:44.500* :  seems to have developed some faults.
*23:44.800- 23:47.220* :  So they've been stuck up in orbit ever since.
*23:47.580- 23:49.420* :  And they've given their first news conference.
*23:49.420- 23:51.700* :  Our reporter Anna Aslam was watching.
*23:52.260- 23:55.000* :  Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore are the first astronauts
*23:55.000- 23:56.920* :  to fly Boeing Starliner spaceship.
*23:56.920- 23:59.680* :  But the dream is quickly becoming a nightmare.
*24:00.300- 24:02.020* :  They've been at the International Space Station
*24:02.020- 24:04.960* :  for more than a month now after the return was pushed back
*24:04.960- 24:07.360* :  because of thruster malfunctions and helium leaks.
*24:07.920- 24:09.720* :  Speaking from the ISS, the pair said
*24:09.720- 24:12.580* :  they had full faith Starliner would bring them home.
*24:12.880- 24:14.000* :  We're absolutely confident.
*24:14.000- 24:16.620* :  We are actually doing thruster testing as we speak.
*24:16.940- 24:18.260* :  And we are going to learn from that.
*24:18.300- 24:20.700* :  But right now, based on what we know, we're absolutely ready.
*24:20.960- 24:23.420* :  I feel confident that if we had to,
*24:23.440- 24:26.020* :  if there was a problem within the International Space Station,
*24:26.020- 24:29.400* :  we can get in our spacecraft, undock, talk to our team,
*24:29.400- 24:31.500* :  and figure out the best way to come home.
*24:31.900- 24:33.820* :  Williams and Wilmore said they were keeping busy
*24:33.820- 24:36.500* :  doing experiments and were enjoying floating around.
*24:37.080- 24:39.260* :  But back down on Earth, NASA and Boeing
*24:39.260- 24:40.860* :  are in a less jovial mood.
*24:41.460- 24:42.920* :  Engineers are working around the clock
*24:42.920- 24:45.220* :  to diagnose and solve Starliner's problems.
*24:45.880- 24:48.540* :  NASA's Steve Stitch said they were working to a tight schedule
*24:48.540- 24:50.980* :  to avoid overcrowding at the space station.
*24:51.480- 24:53.220* :  He said the astronauts would be brought home
*24:53.220- 24:54.240* :  as soon as possible.
*24:54.500- 24:56.520* :  I think some of the data suggests to optimistically,
*24:56.520- 24:57.760* :  maybe it's by the end of July,
*24:57.760- 25:00.520* :  but the big driver is the handover
*25:00.520- 25:03.140* :  that we have coming up between crew 8 and crew 9,
*25:03.560- 25:04.820* :  which is in mid-August.
*25:05.000- 25:07.740* :  NASA and Boeing in particular have repeatedly said
*25:07.740- 25:10.840* :  Williams and Wilmore aren't stuck or stranded in space.
*25:10.840- 25:14.560* :  The Starliner can remain docked at the ISS for 45 days,
*25:15.080- 25:17.620* :  and engineers are working on extending its battery life.
*25:18.120- 25:19.340* :  If it still doesn't work,
*25:19.340- 25:21.720* :  the astronauts can hitch a lift with other crews up there.
*25:22.180- 25:25.600* :  But after years of delay and more than a billion dollars over budget,
*25:26.060- 25:28.220* :  Starliner was meant to be a big win for Boeing
*25:28.220- 25:30.640* :  as it faces a safety crisis over its airplanes.
*25:31.320- 25:34.640* :  It would be humiliating if the astronauts Boeing put in orbit
*25:34.640- 25:37.340* :  have to be brought back home by Russia or SpaceX.
*25:38.220- 25:40.860* :  Of course, if Starliner does manage to complete its mission,
*25:40.860- 25:44.620* :  it'll be one step closer to becoming a routine mode of transport for NASA,
*25:45.200- 25:48.740* :  although astronauts may overback for future flights just in case.
*25:49.580- 25:50.240* :  Anna Aslam.
*25:51.100- 25:54.080* :  Now with its catchy melodies, polished dance routines,
*25:54.080- 25:55.840* :  and stylish music videos,
*25:56.300- 26:00.040* :  K-pop has transformed from a South Korean musical subculture
*26:00.380- 26:01.620* :  to a global phenomenon.
*26:02.060- 26:04.220* :  However, the industry has now become divided
*26:04.580- 26:06.440* :  over the issue of artificial intelligence.
*26:07.100- 26:09.080* :  Seventeen, which I'm sure you are aware,
*26:09.080- 26:10.700* :  is a leading K-pop band,
*26:10.700- 26:14.780* :  is among a growing number using AI to create music videos
*26:15.180- 26:15.880* :  and write lyrics,
*26:16.260- 26:17.160* :  Elebicinal reports.
*26:17.840- 26:19.860* :  South Korea likes to be on the forefront
*26:19.860- 26:22.000* :  when it comes to technological innovation,
*26:22.060- 26:24.740* :  and its music industry is no exception.
*26:33.480- 26:36.160* :  That's Seventeen, one of the biggest acts in K-pop.
*26:36.160- 26:40.120* :  Last year, their albums sold 16 million copies worldwide.
*26:40.840- 26:42.920* :  The music video for their most recent single,
*26:42.920- 26:45.700* :  Maestro, features an AI-generated scene,
*26:46.140- 26:47.000* :  and one of the band members,
*26:47.000- 26:49.260* :  Weezy, has hinted artificial intelligence,
*26:49.260- 26:51.140* :  was used to write some of the lyrics.
*26:51.840- 26:54.900* :  He said he was experimenting because he wanted to develop
*26:54.900- 26:56.340* :  alongside the technology,
*26:56.780- 26:58.520* :  rather than complain about it.
*26:59.160- 27:01.440* :  Megan Lawson is an entertainment journalist.
*27:01.440- 27:04.180* :  She says many artists are feeling the same.
*27:04.620- 27:08.420* :  This is a real marked change from previous use of AI and K-pop,
*27:08.420- 27:11.280* :  where it used to be a case of fans using it
*27:11.620- 27:12.660* :  to make AI covers,
*27:13.060- 27:15.140* :  getting their favorite songs to be re-voiced
*27:15.140- 27:16.300* :  in the style of other singers.
*27:16.900- 27:19.000* :  Those videos perform incredibly well on YouTube,
*27:19.060- 27:19.820* :  and you have to think,
*27:19.820- 27:21.420* :  OK, if K-pop artists thought,
*27:21.840- 27:23.100* :  well, their videos are doing well,
*27:23.140- 27:24.680* :  should we give it a go as well now?
*27:29.360- 27:31.020* :  It seems more and more bands
*27:31.020- 27:33.220* :  are jumping on the AI bandwagon.
*27:37.060- 27:40.160* :  Girl group Asper used AI in their latest music video,
*27:40.620- 27:44.360* :  which surpassed 10 million views within 10 hours of its launch.
*27:44.940- 27:46.540* :  But how is this going down with fans?
*27:47.160- 27:48.260* :  Some of them brace the move,
*27:48.460- 27:51.340* :  but others say it compromises the connection they have
*27:51.340- 27:52.700* :  with their favorite artists.
*27:53.200- 27:55.680* :  Ashley Peralta presents a K-pop fan podcast
*27:55.680- 27:56.760* :  from the Philippines.
*27:57.340- 27:58.520* :  The thing with K-pop fans,
*27:58.620- 28:02.340* :  they love it when the music is a reflection of the artist,
*28:02.840- 28:04.500* :  very hands on with their creative process,
*28:04.500- 28:06.740* :  like they're choreographing their own pieces,
*28:06.740- 28:08.900* :  they are composing and producing,
*28:08.900- 28:12.860* :  and you get a piece of their feelings into that song.
*28:13.300- 28:15.000* :  So when it comes to AI,
*28:15.000- 28:18.340* :  it takes that very crucial component
*28:18.340- 28:20.600* :  that connects fans to the artist away.
*28:21.200- 28:23.180* :  And it's not just an issue in K-pop.
*28:23.640- 28:24.340* :  Just last month,
*28:24.520- 28:25.860* :  some of the world's biggest artists,
*28:26.160- 28:28.060* :  including Billy Eilish and Nicki Minaj,
*28:28.060- 28:30.240* :  wrote an open letter calling for an end
*28:30.240- 28:32.820* :  to what they call the predatory use of AI
*28:32.820- 28:34.080* :  in the music industry.
*28:34.660- 28:37.000* :  They say a lack of regulation could undermine
*28:37.000- 28:39.020* :  the human artistry of songwriters
*28:39.520- 28:42.060* :  and stop them getting fair compensation for their work.
*28:49.080- 28:51.560* :  To quote some of the lyrics in 17 single,
*28:51.860- 28:53.180* :  Good Life, We Go Global,
*28:53.180- 28:55.260* :  always following the Maestro's lead,
*28:55.900- 28:56.660* :  if that's the case,
*28:56.660- 28:59.060* :  the integration of AI in K-pop
*28:59.060- 29:01.660* :  is no longer a question of if, but when.
*29:06.860- 29:09.140* :  17, ending that report from Ella Bickle.
*29:10.940- 29:12.140* :  And that's it from us for now,
*29:12.140- 29:14.860* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*29:14.860- 29:16.640* :  If you would like to comment on this edition

*29:33.200- 29:34.000* :  I'm Jackie Leonard,
*29:34.000- 29:35.760* :  and until next time, goodbye.
*29:43.920- 29:46.340* :  This is the story of how a group of people
*29:46.640- 29:48.660* :  brought music back to Afghanistan
*29:48.660- 29:53.200* :  by creating their own version of American Idol.
*29:54.440- 29:56.000* :  The joy they brought to the nation.
*29:56.500- 29:57.700* :  You're free completely.
*29:58.120- 29:59.740* :  No one is there to destroy you.
*30:00.040- 30:01.680* :  The danger they endured.
*30:02.100- 30:04.340* :  This fact, my head should be cut off.
*30:05.140- 30:05.960* :  I'm John Legend.
