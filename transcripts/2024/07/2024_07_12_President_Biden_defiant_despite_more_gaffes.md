*01:23.580- 01:29.300* :  I'm Jackie Lannard and at 13 hours GMT on Friday, the 12th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:29.840- 01:34.540* :  President Joe Biden's latest gaffes continue to raise questions over his age and ability
*01:34.540- 01:35.840* :  to serve another term.
*01:35.840- 01:40.680* :  We'll hear from a Republican anti-Trumper and get the view from Moscow.
*01:41.240- 01:46.160* :  The head of Japan's Navy resigns over a series of scandals, including the
*01:46.160- 01:48.900* :  mishandling of classified documents by staff.
*01:49.580- 01:55.120* :  And Colombia's president says legalizing the cocaine trade would end the country's
*01:55.160- 01:55.920* :  armed conflict.
*01:58.740- 02:04.140* :  Also in this podcast, the bullet vending machines in the US and why the company behind
*02:04.140- 02:09.400* :  them says there are more secure way to dispense ammunition and scientists return
*02:09.400- 02:14.100* :  to the wreck of the Titanic for the first time since the Titan submersible disaster.
*02:14.560- 02:16.920* :  But this time it will be robots making the dive.
*02:17.220- 02:21.840* :  The Bowser and debris field, we're going to image and collect the most advanced data
*02:21.840- 02:23.340* :  set on Titanic to date.
*02:30.140- 02:36.740* :  Warries about Joe Biden's age and mental acuity are continuing to swirl after he made two
*02:36.740- 02:38.760* :  high-profile gaffes on Thursday.
*02:39.280- 02:43.400* :  The first happened at the NATO conference when he accidentally introduced Ukraine's president
*02:43.400- 02:45.380* :  Zelensky as president Putin.
*02:45.940- 02:51.400* :  And later at a news conference when he called his deputy Kamala Harris, Vice President Trump.
*02:51.920- 02:57.320* :  Mr. Biden insists he is fit to run for a second term and that he's the best person to
*02:57.320- 03:00.660* :  beat Donald Trump, even though the polls suggest otherwise.
*03:01.200- 03:07.420* :  Mike Murphy is a Republican political consultant who was behind the campaigns of Arnold Schwarzenegger
*03:07.760- 03:08.800* :  and John McCain.
*03:08.800- 03:13.580* :  He's now campaigning against Donald Trump and has been talking to Democrats and others
*03:14.100- 03:15.380* :  about what happens now.
*03:15.380- 03:20.560* :  Justin Webb asked him what he made of President Biden's latest public appearance.
*03:21.200- 03:26.600* :  It was a wobbly performance and the president is in a tough position where everything is
*03:26.600- 03:30.440* :  under a microscope now and he looks old, sounds old.
*03:30.680- 03:33.680* :  It was not the disaster of the debate but it was not the triumph.
*03:33.680- 03:38.740* :  I think he needed to put out the bonfire of panic inside the Democratic Party.
*03:39.080- 03:44.280* :  The point that the White House is making and supporters of Joe Biden is that Donald Trump
*03:45.080- 03:49.900* :  would have been just as bad, in fact considerably worse when it came to a grasp of world affairs.
*03:51.020- 03:55.300* :  Well, I think that's a legitimate argument but the debate in the presidential race right
*03:55.300- 03:59.060* :  now that Biden is losing badly is not about world affairs.
*03:59.100- 04:02.720* :  It's about his Joe Biden too old to serve as president of the United States.
*04:03.340- 04:06.760* :  And people had tremendous concerns about that before the debate.
*04:07.400- 04:13.460* :  Then they saw the debate which in living color confirmed their worst suspicions and you
*04:13.460- 04:17.160* :  know, the Biden guys need an almost unachievable superhuman performance.
*04:17.160- 04:21.380* :  He has to turn into John F. Kennedy, which he's incapable of doing because he is 81.
*04:22.200- 04:26.360* :  So they're in a kind of vortex circling a drain that's very, very hard to get out of
*04:26.440- 04:27.960* :  and I don't think they got out of it tonight.
*04:27.960- 04:32.800* :  I think there's a lot of behind the scenes, McLean Nations and the Democratic Party about
*04:33.500- 04:38.540* :  why do we have to have a suicide pact in this election when Trump would be very vulnerable
*04:38.540- 04:43.840* :  to a more attractive candidate. The problem is Biden's got 98% of the delegates pledged to him,
*04:43.840- 04:48.680* :  not bound by the way, which is important but pledged, which is quite a handshake,
*04:48.680- 04:53.880* :  but it's not bound by handcuffs like the Republican system where delegates have absolutely
*04:53.880- 04:58.500* :  no choice. So there's enough flex in the system that there's a lot of intrigue going on and
*04:58.740- 05:04.440* :  I don't think the press conference performance did much to slow that down, might even speed it up.
*05:04.560- 05:10.660* :  What if he just does carry on? I mean, what happens then, do you think Mike? Is there a path now
*05:10.660- 05:14.720* :  to victory? I suppose that's the question. Is there a way in which the White House can say,
*05:14.720- 05:19.080* :  okay, we're getting everything together? This is what we're going to do. Joe Biden's staying
*05:19.080- 05:24.500* :  here we go. Well, that is a realistic scenario. They can just go to a bunker mentality,
*05:25.060- 05:29.440* :  hold their delegates, fend off the fight, which is an open question if it's open warfare,
*05:29.440- 05:34.560* :  but at decent chance, of course, he has a lot of advantages to do that. Controls the organizational
*05:34.680- 05:39.840* :  stuff. And then it's most likely he loses the Donald Trump. Now, it's not impossible he could win,
*05:40.520- 05:45.420* :  because Trump can always go perform his own act of political suicide. You know, you never know
*05:45.420- 05:51.140* :  of Trump. So this whole thing is sort of a house of cards right now with great instability.
*05:51.140- 05:56.660* :  Often many of us in the political world joke that somehow this year, the Democrats chose the
*05:56.660- 06:01.980* :  one candidate that even Donald Trump can beat, and the Republicans chose the one candidate that
*06:01.980- 06:06.860* :  even Joe Biden can beat. So it's tough to forecast, but the polling is quite clear right now.
*06:07.360- 06:13.380* :  The country by scary big numbers, if you're a Democrat, wants to fire Joe Biden. They want to
*06:13.380- 06:18.400* :  do it on economic performance, and then worries about his age. That was a problem before the debate.
*06:18.400- 06:25.400* :  It's become a massive problem now. That was Mike Murphy. Well, a stumbling and gaff-prone Joe Biden
*06:25.400- 06:30.100* :  will obviously help Donald Trump's campaign, but as the war in Ukraine rages on,
*06:30.100- 06:35.460* :  it could also be seen as a propaganda gift to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
*06:36.120- 06:41.660* :  The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had, like the whole world, noticed Joe Biden's
*06:41.660- 06:48.060* :  mix-up over Putin and Zelensky. So what's the media in Moscow and elsewhere making of all this?
*06:48.360- 06:51.920* :  Here's Vitaly Stepchenko, the Russia editor at BBC Monitoring.
*06:52.420- 06:58.380* :  The Russian media are all over it. That clip was on top of one of the main
*06:59.180- 07:04.300* :  television bulletins this morning on the Russian State TV. They showed it, and the
*07:04.300- 07:10.420* :  told was predictably sarcastic, and they said that America's vassals, that's the word they used,
*07:10.420- 07:15.760* :  President and the meeting, they pretended they had not noticed anything. On another channel,
*07:16.260- 07:23.700* :  the presenter spoke of how close Joe Biden is to Valia and how his gaffs were, they
*07:23.700- 07:29.580* :  were not asked out. So that gives an idea of the tone of Russian media coverage, and one popular
*07:29.580- 07:37.560* :  newspaper, Moscowvsky comes some wallets. Renin article comparing Joe Biden to elderly communist
*07:37.560- 07:45.940* :  leaders of the USSR. So the point state media and Kremlin controlled media in Russia are
*07:45.940- 07:53.920* :  making. It's not just that Joe Biden is too old to govern. They are suggesting that America's
*07:53.920- 08:00.260* :  democracy itself is in terminal decline, and has this particular election has become a contest
*08:00.260- 08:07.800* :  between the unspeakable and the incapable, and meanwhile in Russia does a fully functioning
*08:07.900- 08:14.400* :  orderly system presided over by Vladimir Putin. That's the message Russian audiences are getting.
*08:14.720- 08:20.180* :  That was Vitaly Shuchenko and Vitaly also present Ukrainecast, and you can find that wherever
*08:20.180- 08:27.080* :  you get your BBC podcasts. The head of Japan's Navy, Admiral Rho Sakai, has announced he will be
*08:27.080- 08:32.120* :  stepping down at the end of next week. His resignation follows a series of scandals involving
*08:32.120- 08:38.040* :  military security lapses and fraud. More than 200 defense personnel were said to be involved in
*08:38.040- 08:41.740* :  the violations, but the admiral says he is taking responsibility.
*08:45.540- 08:50.100* :  As chief of the maritime staff, I'm responsible for the training of personnel and the
*08:50.100- 08:55.480* :  organizational management of the force, and I'm rightly held accountable for failing to fulfill
*08:55.480- 09:03.340* :  my duties as the manager of specified secrets. Our Asia-Pacific regional editor Mickey
*09:03.340- 09:10.180* :  Bristow told us more. There is a long list of violations involving 218 personnel, some in uniform,
*09:10.180- 09:19.040* :  some civilians, and it contains a real range of offenses. The more serious ones relate to lapses
*09:19.040- 09:26.440* :  in security on board and Japanese naval vessels, essentially allowing unvetted personnel access
*09:26.860- 09:33.020* :  to the position of foreign vessels. This happened on dozens of cases, on 38 vessels, the
*09:33.020- 09:38.920* :  investigators found. So that's the more serious laps. Some of them were more trivial, though, and
*09:38.920- 09:46.740* :  small scale. So for example, some personnel were found who have claimed pay for tasks they didn't
*09:46.740- 09:51.680* :  engage in, specifically things like going on diving trips, they didn't do it, they claim back money
*09:52.480- 09:59.260* :  for doing it. Other cases were quite trivial, such as claiming for meals on canteens, on bases
*09:59.260- 10:06.200* :  that they weren't entitled to. So a real range of cases here in the punishments reflect that.
*10:06.200- 10:11.860* :  So some people have stepped down, have been punished that way, others have just been recommended.
*10:12.440- 10:16.840* :  And obviously this has been taken very seriously, and it comes as Japan is trying to strengthen
*10:16.840- 10:23.540* :  its defense forces against China. Sure, that will be the most serious worry about these investigations,
*10:23.540- 10:29.660* :  not the very trivial cases, but the ones about laps of security. Japan, over the last couple of
*10:29.660- 10:34.440* :  years, has increased defense spending, it's trying to bolster its military in the face of a
*10:34.440- 10:41.460* :  number of threats, China of course, and also North Korea, also Russia in that part of the world as
*10:41.500- 10:48.140* :  well. So Japan is trying to bolster its military also to tighten upon security and introduce new
*10:48.140- 10:55.660* :  laws to make sure sensitive information is more treated more securely. So obviously these lapses
*10:56.040- 11:02.260* :  will be of a great consideration, just to underscore just how much Japan is trying to bolster its
*11:02.260- 11:07.220* :  relationships with its allies as well. The Prime Minister Fumio Kishiro is in Washington at the moment
*11:07.220- 11:13.100* :  talking to NATO members, so he's already apologized for what are very embarrassing lapses.
*11:13.420- 11:18.780* :  That was Mickey Bristo. Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has said that the armed conflict in his
*11:18.780- 11:24.640* :  country would end within a day if the UN declared cocaine legal across the world. Speaking at the
*11:24.640- 11:29.760* :  United Nations Peace Building Commission in New York, Mr. Petro said that profits from the illegal
*11:29.760- 11:37.300* :  cocaine trade fueled the violence. If tomorrow the United Nations Commission on Drugs would say
*11:37.300- 11:43.780* :  that cocaine is legal, tomorrow the war in Colombia will be over. It is a simpler start,
*11:44.700- 11:49.900* :  but as this is not possible for political reasons or will not be possible for a long time,
*11:49.900- 11:55.920* :  the war in Colombia continues. President Petro's direct appeal to the United Nations
*11:55.920- 12:01.400* :  marks a new direction in his efforts to find alternative solutions to tackling the drugs trade.
*12:02.000- 12:06.260* :  But in fact, he's long argued that the current so-called war on drugs has been a failure,
*12:06.680- 12:10.240* :  as Paul Moss heard from our last in America analyst Luis Fajardo.
*12:10.760- 12:14.600* :  He has been saying for some months now that he believes that the war against drugs,
*12:14.600- 12:18.100* :  which by the West, has failed. And I think many Colombians agree with that.
*12:18.520- 12:23.600* :  We would say that after decades and decades of repressive policies, they have not been able to
*12:23.600- 12:29.060* :  really control the flow of drugs to the West. Colombia is still the world's biggest cocaine producer
*12:29.060- 12:34.920* :  and it's producing a lot of cocaine. But however, at a great, great cost internally in terms of
*12:35.340- 12:41.060* :  the violence that drug money has continuously now for decades generated in this country.
*12:41.420- 12:46.280* :  And President Petro has been saying that a new approach is needed, an opinion that I think
*12:46.280- 12:52.560* :  resonates with many Colombians who have, of course, suffered greatly because of the violence caused
*12:52.560- 12:56.920* :  by this war against drugs and, of course, the action of drug trafficking gangs.
*12:57.200- 13:02.660* :  You yourself come from Colombia, Luis. Can you give us an idea of how widespread these
*13:02.660- 13:06.880* :  problems are? Is it just in certain areas that the gangs caused these kind of problems?
*13:06.880- 13:11.780* :  As you say, I grew up in Colombia and I would say an experience of my generation was to have
*13:11.780- 13:19.520* :  our country's life entirely molded by the fact of drug trafficking, a huge impact in almost every
*13:19.520- 13:25.380* :  aspect of everyday life, the violence, the intimidation that for many decades, these drug
*13:25.380- 13:31.180* :  cartels generated, the huge environmental impact, this has caused the degradation of Colombia's
*13:31.180- 13:36.860* :  natural environment and the sheer amount of victims, both people killed directly by the cartels
*13:36.860- 13:41.020* :  or people who had to move to other parts of the country or even outside the country.
*13:41.320- 13:45.840* :  So it is something that definitely has been in the background of our lives now for decades.
*13:45.840- 13:49.860* :  And it is definitely something that Colombians feel very strongly about.
*13:49.860- 13:55.420* :  President Petro says he wants the United Nations to declare cocaine legal, but
*13:55.420- 14:00.080* :  campaigners have long argued that soft drugs should be legalized and they haven't had any
*14:00.080- 14:04.720* :  success at an international level. Is there any chance? Do you think that the UN could say that
*14:05.080- 14:10.280* :  cocaine should be legalized? My impression is that President Petro realizes the political
*14:10.280- 14:14.900* :  impossibility of that happening in countries like the United States. I don't think he expects
*14:14.900- 14:19.800* :  the United States supporting anytime soon a legalization of cocaine. However,
*14:20.340- 14:26.520* :  this course he has been using saying that the Western approaches and the Western ideas for
*14:26.520- 14:31.760* :  these war and drugs are not working. They have been useful to justify changes in priority
*14:31.760- 14:37.540* :  in his own countries, anti-drug policies. For many years, the priority in Colombia's anti-drug
*14:37.540- 14:44.860* :  policies was to eradicate small fields of coca-crop grown by hundreds of thousands of peasants.
*14:45.200- 14:49.320* :  And the Petro argues, and so many people in Colombia would agree with him that many of these
*14:49.320- 14:54.520* :  peasants didn't have many other alternatives. And to have the full force of the state directed
*14:54.520- 14:59.580* :  against them, he doesn't see it as the most efficient and even the most fair way of combating
*14:59.580- 15:04.920* :  drug trafficking. He has said it might be more useful to emphasize interdiction of big smuggling
*15:04.920- 15:10.560* :  operations to go after the big guys. And this has somehow allowed President Petro while at the
*15:10.560- 15:16.280* :  same time they have been reducing the acreage of coca crops being eradicated by government
*15:16.280- 15:22.800* :  security forces. At the same time, they have increased quite substantially the amount of cocaine,
*15:22.800- 15:28.780* :  of actual cocaine being seized in aerial and maritime interdiction operations. The Colombian
*15:28.780- 15:34.700* :  state forces say that they have seized more than 300 tons of cocaine during the first semester of
*15:35.020- 15:40.120* :  2024, quite a substantial amount. And in that sense, they argue that this would be a more
*15:40.120- 15:44.960* :  effective and also a more socially sustainable way of fighting drug trafficking.
*15:45.460- 15:52.080* :  That was Luis Fajardo. Still to come. Expect glitz, glamour,
*15:52.080- 15:58.300* :  expect a star-studded event. It is going to be one of the most expensive weddings that
*15:58.300- 16:03.880* :  Indians see or even the world would see. In the Indian city of Mumbai, the climax of wedding
*16:03.880- 16:06.600* :  celebrations for the son of Asia's richest man.
*16:13.900- 16:16.880* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mint Mobile. With the price of just about everything
*16:16.880- 16:21.980* :  going up during inflation, we thought we'd bring our prices down. So to help us, we brought

*16:43.960- 16:50.840* :  This is the story of how a group of people brought music back to Afghanistan by creating their own
*16:50.840- 16:57.700* :  version of American Idol. The joy they brought to the nation. You're free completely,
*16:57.700- 17:04.360* :  no one is there to destroy you. The danger they endured. It fed my head should be cut off.
*17:05.180- 17:11.840* :  I'm John Legend. Listen to Afghan Star on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcast.
*17:19.600- 17:24.100* :  The leader of a church group accused of causing the death of an eight-year-old diabetic girl
*17:24.100- 17:29.760* :  by withholding her insulin has told an Australian court that the trial was religious persecution.
*17:29.900- 17:35.680* :  Elizabeth Struse was found dead at her home into Wumbher near Brisbane in January 2022
*17:36.380- 17:40.720* :  after she had allegedly gone without the medicine for several days. The religious sect
*17:40.720- 17:46.800* :  had been praying for her health. Fourteen people, including her parents, are on trial. Simon Atkinson
*17:46.800- 17:51.580* :  reports. This was the first time the court here in Brisbane heard from any of the defendants since
*17:51.580- 17:56.580* :  the trial began. Brendan Stevens, the leader of a small Christian group that called itself the
*17:56.580- 18:01.600* :  saints, said he wanted to give the judge their perspective on this case. Stevens is charged with
*18:01.600- 18:06.560* :  murdering Elizabeth Struse along with the girl's father by withdrawing her insulin. The prosecutors
*18:06.560- 18:12.000* :  say they knew the child would die as a result. Elizabeth's mother, brother and ten others are charged
*18:12.000- 18:17.080* :  with manslaughter, or are members of the sect. Stevens said the group had no intention of fighting
*18:17.080- 18:22.300* :  the case by using law, which is why they'd refused lawyers, hadn't applied for bail and refused
*18:22.300- 18:27.160* :  to say whether they were guilty or not guilty. We don't have any particular care amongst ourselves
*18:27.160- 18:32.560* :  what the judgment is, he told the court. We don't come to fight the charge. Stevens said the group
*18:32.560- 18:37.480* :  had chosen to walk with God and that the Bible was filled with stories of Jesus Christ working
*18:37.480- 18:42.640* :  miracles. We are within our rights to believe in the word of God completely, as we do, Mr. Stevens
*18:42.640- 18:47.460* :  said. He added, this isn't really a trial about the murder of a child, as it is a religious
*18:48.240- 18:52.960* :  persecution. A former police forensic officer also gave evidence on Friday about arriving at the
*18:52.960- 18:58.440* :  house where Elizabeth died to find people singing and playing guitar. She talked the court through
*18:58.440- 19:02.960* :  photos of the scene, which included handwritten posters, one saying she's only sleeping,
*19:02.960- 19:08.440* :  and another God will heal Elizabeth no matter what. It alleged Elizabeth Struse had been dead for
*19:08.440- 19:13.240* :  some time before emergency services were called. This trial, which is being held without a jury,
*19:13.240- 19:17.100* :  is set to run for another 11 weeks. Simon Atkinson in Brisbane.
*19:18.300- 19:24.300* :  Garne ownership in America is often a contentious issue. Critics say weapons and ammunition are
*19:24.300- 19:30.100* :  too easily available. So a new development introduced in Alabama, Oklahoma and Texas is raising
*19:30.100- 19:35.620* :  eyebrows. Automatic vending machines selling bullets will appear in grocery stores,
*19:35.620- 19:41.300* :  with a manufacturer saying that artificial intelligence software means this will be more
*19:41.300- 19:48.220* :  secure than other sales methods. Grant Majors is the CEO of American Rounds, the company behind
*19:48.220- 19:53.180* :  these machines, and he's been telling James Coppnell how they work. It will ask them to insert
*19:53.180- 19:59.820* :  their ID. It'll scan the ID, and it's also going to determine if someone is 21. It'll do facial
*19:59.820- 20:04.620* :  recognition scan to make sure the person is who they say they are, and it's not someone who's
*20:04.620- 20:09.960* :  trying to use someone else's ID or stolen ID. And then only then, when the identification is
*20:09.960- 20:14.380* :  verified that they're of legal age and they are who they are, can the transaction be complete?
*20:15.140- 20:23.040* :  What presumably it can't do is judge the mood of the person tell if the person appears to be drunk
*20:23.040- 20:29.760* :  or high on drugs or dangerously angry, for example. So in the United States, ammunition is sold
*20:29.760- 20:38.840* :  to primary ways. It's sold off the shelf in retail stores or it's sold online. Online, anybody who's
*20:38.840- 20:44.160* :  a minor can simply click a button that says they're of age. Nobody can tell what state of mind
*20:44.160- 20:48.440* :  they're in, who they are, how they are, and they can have ammo shipped right to their house.
*20:49.100- 20:54.860* :  If they go to a retail store, ammo sits on the shelf, no different than bread in a grocery store,
*20:54.860- 21:00.480* :  and they can walk right up to the front register, check out like anybody else, and people generally
*21:00.480- 21:05.560* :  don't ask for their ID. They're supposed to, but they don't. I've never been asked for my ID
*21:05.560- 21:11.780* :  ever my entire life when purchasing ammo. And not only that, it's a high degree of theft when it
*21:11.780- 21:16.560* :  just sits on the shelf, right? It's a very shop liftable item. One store that I won't
*21:16.560- 21:23.060* :  mention the name and the Northeast had 500,000 rounds of ammo stolen, one retail store. So here in
*21:23.060- 21:28.500* :  the United States, hands down, we are the safest, most secure method of ammo sales in the country.
*21:28.820- 21:34.400* :  What about the argument that goes, if it's got a computer and it can be hacked, that there is
*21:34.400- 21:40.400* :  a vulnerability there. People have bad intentions. What is the more likely scenario? Are they more
*21:40.400- 21:45.500* :  likely to go to a local pawn shop, which you can do here and pay cash for ammunition and walk out,
*21:45.840- 21:49.980* :  buy it online and have it shipped to your house, go shop lifted in a retail store because it sits
*21:49.980- 21:55.820* :  on the shelf, or walk into a grocery store where machines are located, security cameras monitoring
*21:55.820- 22:02.300* :  it, hack the machine, you still have to use a credit card, use a driver's license, and have your
*22:02.300- 22:08.880* :  facial recognition scan. See that when you look at the context of how ammunition sold, it's still the
*22:08.880- 22:14.080* :  safest and most secure method in the United States of selling ammunition. Do you think there's going
*22:14.080- 22:19.460* :  to be a huge amount of demand for this sort of way of purchasing ammunition? We were actually
*22:19.460- 22:26.260* :  approached by the grocery stores, they came to us and asked if we could do this for them. So the
*22:26.260- 22:31.380* :  stores that we are in are in very rural communities. So some of them, if they're hunters and they
*22:31.380- 22:37.000* :  would have to drive some of them over an hour just to get to a retail shop. So the stores came to
*22:37.000- 22:42.180* :  us and they said, hey, we kind of thought they'd be great to offer ammunition sales to our customers,
*22:42.180- 22:47.040* :  and they approached us to do that because they wanted to bring value to their customers and come
*22:47.040- 22:54.480* :  to their store. Gromp majors. What knew to discover about the Titanic? The ship, which became infamous
*22:54.480- 23:01.120* :  when it sank after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912, has been the subject of
*23:01.120- 23:07.660* :  books, films, and many explorations to find its wreckage. The last one in a submersible ended
*23:07.660- 23:13.820* :  in disaster. But now a new expedition is setting off that will lower a robot thousands of meters
*23:13.820- 23:19.480* :  below the surface of the North Atlantic to scan the site. Our science editor Rebecca Morrell
*23:19.860- 23:23.100* :  has had exclusive access before the team leaves for the site.
*23:26.180- 23:30.280* :  I'm in Providence Port in Rhode Island and I'm standing on the deck of a hundred meter
*23:30.520- 23:35.680* :  long ship that's getting ready to set sail. There's been a hive of activity here. There's been
*23:35.880- 23:41.120* :  fuelings, supplies have been loaded onto the ship using a giant crane because there's going to be
*23:41.180- 23:46.260* :  a 20-day expedition to the most famous shipwreck in the world, the Titanic.
*23:49.220- 23:56.980* :  My name is Troy Lynne and I'm the co-expedition leader. This expedition is all about the entire mapping
*23:56.980- 24:03.680* :  of the entire site, Baustern, debris field to create 3D-4D model situations. We're going to
*24:03.820- 24:07.640* :  image and collect the most advanced data set on Titanic to date.
*24:10.080- 24:17.580* :  We're standing next to one of the two remotely operated vehicles or ROVs and it's pretty big.
*24:17.580- 24:23.800* :  It's probably about the size of a fan. The ROV stands for remote meeting remotely operated,
*24:23.800- 24:29.360* :  no people on board, but it will be outfitted with some of the most advanced cameras and sensors
*24:30.340- 24:34.860* :  that are out in technology right now. And just tell me a little bit about one of the
*24:35.120- 24:39.000* :  instruments because you're trying something out for the very first time on you. There's a magnet
*24:39.000- 24:45.100* :  almost there. There is. This is a brand new. It's called a hyper-mag, which will give us an idea
*24:45.100- 24:51.060* :  of what's below the med line. So the debris and the artifacts that might be hidden,
*24:51.660- 24:56.880* :  we're going to get a chance to not see them, but image that will make some calculations and try
*24:56.880- 25:02.520* :  to determine how far below the med line the bow actually is and what the shape of it is. Is it
*25:02.660- 25:07.380* :  intact? Is it opened up? So it's a very new and exciting tool for this site.
*25:08.140- 25:14.720* :  Can I go into control band a minute? So I'll walk you up to the UHD-326 control band.
*25:17.060- 25:24.420* :  Inside here are all the pilots instrumentation to record all the video, collect all the sensor data,
*25:24.680- 25:29.900* :  manipulate the arms. They have joysticks, much like an F-16 for flying the ROV.
*25:30.940- 25:35.960* :  Everything comes from the ROV and it comes to here before it goes anywhere else. And there's
*25:35.960- 25:42.820* :  typically two guys in here, a pilot and a co-pilot, and they are flying the ROV to collect all the data.
*25:45.820- 25:53.860* :  This expedition is also a chance for you to remember your friend's and colleague Paul
*25:53.860- 26:00.840* :  Henri Nagiale or pH as he was known. He was a veteran underwater explorer and was one of the five
*26:00.840- 26:06.960* :  people who died last year when the Titan submersible had a catastrophic failure on its way down to
*26:07.740- 26:14.360* :  the wreck. Yeah, pH and I had been planning this together for many months and it's just a horrible,
*26:14.360- 26:21.680* :  horrible tragedy and you know, pH was an inspiration to me. Just an amazing, amazing individual and
*26:22.400- 26:29.200* :  we really want to do something special to honor him. So we've had a very special plaque made in
*26:29.200- 26:34.840* :  his honor. We'll bring it down on the ROV and we'll go place it and we'll have a moment on the
*26:34.840- 26:42.900* :  back deck and we'll say a few words and the Titanic was his passion and you know, pH he was a legend
*26:42.940- 26:47.000* :  and legends don't die. So we're going to honor him. Sorry.
*26:51.700- 26:55.560* :  For you, which parts would you most like spend some time looking at?
*26:56.560- 27:01.860* :  I would really like to see into the Marconi room. I want to see what the expansion joint looks
*27:01.900- 27:07.200* :  like since last winter there. I've heard it's opened up. I'd like to take another look at the
*27:07.740- 27:13.540* :  big boiler that sits proud out in the debris field but every time you go here you will see new
*27:13.540- 27:21.500* :  and fascinating things. Now, RMS Titanic Inc has the salvage rights to the wreck and has recovered
*27:21.500- 27:29.780* :  thousands of items over the years. What would you say to those who think the Titanic should be left
*27:29.960- 27:36.300* :  as a gravesite? I have my own personal views. Other people have theirs but I would like to
*27:37.040- 27:43.680* :  make sure it's preserved for all eternity in whether it's salvaging it or imaging it.
*27:43.880- 27:48.960* :  And the main focus of this mission is to get the data set so that we can plan and we can have
*27:48.960- 27:54.000* :  those conversations and what is important to bring back for exhibit purposes.
*27:56.440- 28:03.320* :  That report was by Rebecca Moral. Months of lavish wedding celebrations in India are reaching
*28:03.320- 28:08.660* :  their final phase for the marriage of the youngest son of Asia's richest man. And it's been
*28:08.660- 28:14.260* :  making headlines all over the country. Peace of breaking news when it comes to the big Indian
*28:14.260- 28:19.700* :  wedding bash. Anand and Radhika's wedding will be held in Mumbai on the 12th of July.
*28:20.040- 28:25.640* :  Ailes performers, CEOs and world leaders are all part of a lavish wedding celebration that is
*28:25.640- 28:31.000* :  spanned across India's Kucharatu, Italy's part of the final. Special chefs have also flown down
*28:31.000- 28:37.220* :  from Indore to ensure that a beautiful and especially curated menu is served to the guests,
*28:37.420- 28:42.420* :  attending the pre-wedding celebrations. Anand and Barney's father is the chairman of Reliance
*28:42.420- 28:47.880* :  Industries, Mukesh and Barney. The bride is Radhika merchant, the daughter of the pharmaceuticals
*28:47.880- 28:54.520* :  tycoons, Veerana and Shaila merchant. The area around the 27-story family mansion in Mumbai is
*28:54.520- 29:00.520* :  decorated with flowers and lights and Bollywood stars, business leaders, politicians and even
*29:00.520- 29:07.920* :  Kim Kardashian are attending. It's estimated to have cost more than $250 million. Our reporter
*29:07.920- 29:15.320* :  Archena Shukla is in Mumbai. Expect Glitz, glamour, expect a star-studded event. It is going to be
*29:15.320- 29:21.780* :  one of the most expensive weddings that Indians see or even the world would see. We've already had
*29:21.780- 29:28.240* :  the whos who of Bollywood sports, politics, global business chiefs all would don't into Mumbai to
*29:28.240- 29:33.240* :  attend this wedding. We've already seen former prime ministers Boris Johnson and Sir Tony Blair,
*29:33.240- 29:38.940* :  Kim Kardashian, like you pointed out, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, wrestler John Cena, all already
*29:38.940- 29:45.560* :  arrive in Mumbai for the event. Today the wedding would happen in the central business district in
*29:45.560- 29:49.740* :  Mumbai, where most of the officers in that region have gone remote because they're expecting
*29:49.740- 29:55.580* :  traffic snars. The police has termed this event a public event because of the VIPs attending it.
*29:55.860- 30:01.120* :  Today would be the wedding through Hindu rituals and there would be the next two days of wedding
*30:01.120- 30:06.380* :  receptions. And with what we've seen in the pre-wedding celebrations over the last four months,
*30:06.380- 30:12.520* :  it is going to be a grand event. As you say, this has been coming for months in the build-up,
*30:12.520- 30:18.160* :  what have been the standout moments? Well, some of the pre-wedding celebrations were too big and
*30:18.160- 30:23.640* :  most people didn't anticipate the scale and size and the glamour of it. One of the big events was
*30:23.640- 30:28.520* :  in March, which was held in Gujarat's Jamnagar, which is the hometown of the Ambani family,
*30:28.520- 30:34.140* :  and it's also the location of their biggest oil refinery complex. 1200 guests attended it,
*30:34.140- 30:39.700* :  and that included Metas, Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft's Bill Gates, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.
*30:40.040- 30:45.020* :  It had a performance by Rihanna, post, which there was a massive and a glamorous extra
*30:45.020- 30:49.780* :  vacanza of a luxury cruise in Italy, which was attended by thousands of guests from
*30:49.780- 30:55.600* :  Bollywood stars to other chiefs from around the world. There has certainly been criticism of
*30:55.600- 30:59.740* :  the cost of this event, hasn't it? Certainly, because this seems to be one of the most
*30:59.740- 31:05.840* :  ostentious weddings that Indians have seen. Mokesh Ambani's family is known to do the big fat
*31:05.840- 31:11.340* :  Indian wedding, but this one has taken it a few notches higher, and certainly with the rising
*31:11.340- 31:16.500* :  inequality becoming very apparent in India, especially post-COVID, this certainly is drawing
*31:16.500- 31:21.720* :  a lot of criticism, the opulence and the display of wealth. That was Ashina Shukla in Mumbai.
*31:24.060- 31:28.580* :  And that's it from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
