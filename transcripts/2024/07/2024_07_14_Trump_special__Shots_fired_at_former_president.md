*01:57.020- 02:01.980* :  Donald Trump was at a US election rally in Pennsylvania when gunfire was heard from the crowd
*02:01.980- 02:07.720* :  and the former president was bundled off the stage by security officials. He raised a fist to
*02:07.720- 02:13.580* :  his supporters before being taken away in a car. What appeared to be blood was seen on Mr. Trump's
*02:13.580- 02:17.780* :  ear. He was criticizing President Biden when the incident happened.
*02:17.780- 02:23.720* :  Worst president in the history of our country took over and look what happened to our country.
*02:24.800- 02:30.660* :  Probably 20 million people and you know that's a little bit old that chart that chart's a
*02:30.660- 02:35.820* :  couple of months old and if you want to really see something to say, take a look at what happened.
*02:41.540- 02:45.900* :  Our correspondent Gary O'Donohue was at the rally and spoke to this eyewitness.
*02:46.340- 02:52.480* :  We were listening to him talk and all of a sudden from my left we heard a bunch of shots and
*02:52.480- 02:58.540* :  people started running towards us so we just took off. People were you know running, tripping
*02:58.540- 03:04.180* :  falling and we just ran until we were across the street behind building. Did you see anyone hit
*03:04.180- 03:11.700* :  it all? No, but I spoke with my mom on the phone and I think from what I understand they
*03:11.700- 03:19.360* :  got it. We can't confirm that at this stage at all. Did you tell where the shooting was coming from?
*03:20.800- 03:24.940* :  It was coming from outside of the building. I think it was like one of these buildings back here.
*03:25.380- 03:28.760* :  Right. So you think it was coming from higher up possibly? Behind the fences.
*03:28.760- 03:33.580* :  Yeah. Okay. And what was the atmosphere like in the crowd at that moment when it started?
*03:35.160- 03:39.380* :  Did people start running? Yeah. Right. They were running and tripping over each other and
*03:40.300- 03:43.760* :  yeah. Yeah. And do you know did the police move in pretty quickly?
*03:44.660- 03:49.660* :  From what I saw. Yeah. There were police officers in the field like right beyond the fence and
*03:49.660- 03:56.060* :  they took off immediately. A short time later the BBC's Karl Nassman got an update from Gary.
*03:56.900- 04:01.840* :  It was about 10 minutes into Donald Trump's speech and he was talking about immigration and
*04:02.660- 04:07.500* :  and then we heard we were actually live on air at the time and we we were talking to our colleagues
*04:07.500- 04:12.860* :  at the BBC World Service and we we heard the shots. I heard maybe six or eight. It sounds like
*04:12.860- 04:17.420* :  from that film you've just played. There may have been more but certainly six or eight in rapid
*04:17.420- 04:24.360* :  succession. We hit the dirt. We hit the deck because we had no idea where the where the shooting
*04:24.360- 04:29.080* :  was coming from and now since then people have been streaming out of the event the former president
*04:29.080- 04:35.200* :  was taken away quickly surrounded by the secret service and taken away immediately reports of some
*04:35.900- 04:40.680* :  blood on his ear possibly him holding is it we don't we don't know the detail. One
*04:40.680- 04:46.040* :  eyewitness I've just spoken to who said he was 50 feet from the former president. He said when
*04:46.040- 04:51.280* :  the shooting started a speaker fell I know it's not clear whether that was on stage or fell into
*04:51.280- 04:57.320* :  the crowd. He said he saw one person being put in to an ambulance. He said there was panic people
*04:57.900- 05:03.780* :  hit the dirt people started screaming. Another eyewitness I said so as boats who said there'd been
*05:03.780- 05:10.300* :  a lot of panic in the crowd as you can imagine both of those eyewitnesses were speculating about
*05:10.300- 05:15.280* :  where the shots had come from and they suggested there was a building just outside the perimeter
*05:15.900- 05:21.460* :  where the shooting might have come from. Now we don't know whether that's true or not it's far too
*05:21.460- 05:29.960* :  soon to tell but it's possible that the shooting was a combination of people shooting in and then
*05:29.960- 05:35.220* :  people shooting out of the of the event because obviously former presidents have a lot of security
*05:35.220- 05:41.860* :  they have the secret service around them they have people who are trained to shoot and shoot
*05:41.860- 05:47.840* :  fast and shoot accurately and some of that fire may have been returned fire at whoever it was
*05:47.840- 05:53.200* :  who was firing towards the crowd because clearly the fire was coming in towards the event itself.
*05:53.840- 05:58.880* :  A lot of confusion still as you can imagine there'll be a lot of people wondering what's happened
*05:58.880- 06:04.540* :  to the former president what his condition is we simply don't know that at this point in time
*06:04.580- 06:12.740* :  I'm sure that will become clear soon but an enormous amount of shock here a really shocking moment
*06:13.920- 06:19.860* :  in this what is after all an extraordinary political campaign and I'm afraid this sort of thing
*06:19.900- 06:25.420* :  this sort of thing will only make the political situation in America even more divided
*06:25.420- 06:31.300* :  even more serious even more fragile. It's a divided country in many ways and these sorts of
*06:31.300- 06:37.640* :  presidential campaigns can often be intense and be emotional and this as you were saying Gary was
*06:37.640- 06:42.040* :  just a couple of days before we're expecting the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin
*06:42.760- 06:47.840* :  it's of course speculation but we'd have to wonder what that might mean for that event which
*06:47.840- 06:54.020* :  is scheduled to begin on Monday you were mentioning Gary we don't know the condition right now of
*06:54.020- 07:01.760* :  Donald Trump what we were able to see was he was ushered by a large group of secret service agents
*07:02.280- 07:07.800* :  into a vehicle he was driven away and while he was being put into that car he was on his own two
*07:07.800- 07:12.680* :  feet and he was motioning to the crowd he was holding his fist up so that would appear to be a
*07:12.680- 07:20.560* :  very good sign for the former president we do have reports and we saw a video of Donald
*07:20.560- 07:26.380* :  Trump holding his ear that was when shots were being fired there are reports that blood was spotted
*07:26.380- 07:31.860* :  on his ear we're going to wait to confirm that and we don't know what that means about his
*07:31.860- 07:37.280* :  potential condition but we do know that he was moved into a vehicle and he left the scene almost
*07:37.280- 07:42.840* :  immediately Gary I think it's worth just reminding our viewers as you were there outside this
*07:42.840- 07:49.740* :  large campaign event one of the last ones before Wisconsin and before that RNC event about the
*07:49.740- 07:54.260* :  kind of security that is typically there Gary if we still if we can still keep you there if you
*07:54.260- 08:00.980* :  don't mind but the these kinds of events featuring high profile politicians featuring presidents
*08:00.980- 08:07.380* :  featuring former president like Donald Trump these are events that have just massive amounts of
*08:07.380- 08:12.540* :  security don't they can you walk us through the types of security procedures that would be in
*08:12.540- 08:18.500* :  place for rally like today's well people have to show up at these things hours and hours in advance
*08:19.220- 08:23.560* :  the media has to show up hours in advance those who want to be inside we weren't we weren't allowed
*08:23.560- 08:30.120* :  inside this rally that's why we're outside we didn't get credentialed for this rally so if you
*08:30.120- 08:34.400* :  want to go in you have to take your equipment in hours and hours before you then have to leave
*08:34.400- 08:39.920* :  it all there the secret service then do what they call a sweep which is that they check everything
*08:39.920- 08:44.900* :  that's inside already and then they let the media back in they let the crowds back in the crowds have
*08:44.900- 08:50.420* :  been coming in really for the last four or five hours and they're checked and they go through
*08:50.420- 08:57.080* :  magnometers their bags are checked it's incredibly tight the security always that these rallies
*08:57.080- 09:01.780* :  particularly for former presidents but for all political candidates but of course this one
*09:01.780- 09:09.340* :  is outdoors this is in a sort of show field for farm for farm shows and this is a rural part of
*09:09.340- 09:16.000* :  Western Pennsylvania we're about 30 miles or so north of Pittsburgh this is a rural community it's
*09:16.280- 09:23.640* :  very much Donald Trump territory he won this county by two thirds by yeah got two thirds of the
*09:23.640- 09:29.840* :  vote back in 2020 in this county this is these are if you like his people and so the the shock
*09:29.840- 09:36.140* :  will be that someone got close enough seemingly got close enough to take some shots at the crowd
*09:36.140- 09:40.680* :  or at the former president we just don't know I have to say the emotions are extraordinary here
*09:41.180- 09:46.640* :  I'm gonna I'm gonna say something now which will be shocking but I think it's worth knowing so
*09:47.020- 09:53.320* :  please prepare yourself for this just a moment ago a guy walked past and said they fired first
*09:53.320- 10:01.420* :  this is war that was Gary O'Donohue talking to Carl Nazman now our correspondent Nomi
*10:01.420- 10:06.740* :  Ikbal is in Wisconsin ahead of that Republican National Convention and she gave us more details
*10:06.740- 10:11.840* :  and reaction I'm in Wisconsin because this is where the Republican National Convention is
*10:11.840- 10:17.980* :  you to take place from Monday Donald Trump will arrive here in order to be officially crowned
*10:17.980- 10:22.620* :  the head of the Republican Party and as you can imagine the security is pretty tight here anyway
*10:22.620- 10:29.320* :  but it's really going to ram up now following what happened in Pennsylvania and when the news came
*10:29.320- 10:36.320* :  through people just started rushing around like in shock looking at their phones just you know
*10:36.320- 10:40.440* :  completely taken about by what had happened and obviously we were trying to piece together
*10:40.440- 10:47.080* :  information we still are but Donald Trump we understand you know as he was holding the
*10:47.080- 10:50.940* :  rally shots were fired we don't know who shot who fired those shots we don't know if they were
*10:50.940- 10:56.140* :  necessarily aimed at him there are some publications calling in their parent assassination attempt we
*10:56.140- 11:01.000* :  can't say that for sure we just don't know he was taken off the stage but before he went off
*11:01.000- 11:08.320* :  before he was taken off by the secret service he did a fist pump and the pictures you might see
*11:08.320- 11:14.860* :  all over social media now of him with what appears to be a very bloody ear and being taken away
*11:15.320- 11:20.320* :  let me just give you a little bit of reaction so far that that we've had particularly from
*11:20.920- 11:25.000* :  what I found interesting from the democratic side people you know people are horrified by what's
*11:25.000- 11:29.860* :  happened representative Hakeem Jeffries who's a democratic leader he said my thoughts and prayers are
*11:29.860- 11:34.300* :  with the former president Donald Trump and thankful for the decisive law enforcement response
*11:34.300- 11:39.940* :  America's a democracy political violence of any kind is never acceptable Senator Chuck Schumer
*11:39.940- 11:45.300* :  of New York also a Democrat says I'm horrified by what happened and relieved that former president
*11:45.300- 11:50.740* :  Trump is safe Republicans have also obviously been coming out and saying their thoughts and prayers
*11:50.740- 11:58.780* :  are with Mr. Trump president Biden has been notified about what's happened he is on his way to
*11:58.780- 12:07.300* :  church and so the I'm just looking at the statement that's come through from the communications
*12:07.300- 12:12.180* :  director from the the the Trump team president Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders
*12:12.180- 12:17.480* :  for their quick action during this heinous act he is fine and is being checked out as a local medical
*12:17.480- 12:24.680* :  facility more details will follow Nomiya Igbal in Wisconsin Rodney Davis is a former Republican
*12:24.680- 12:31.600* :  congressman who was witness to a shooting involving another US politician I never expected to be
*12:32.000- 12:37.980* :  practicing for a charity baseball game one morning at seven a.m. in Alexandria Virginia and
*12:37.980- 12:44.960* :  have to hear one of my colleagues scream run he's got a gun you just you just let instinct take over
*12:45.680- 12:52.060* :  and what I witnessed that day in the 10 minutes of of just pure horror of shooting
*12:53.180- 13:00.660* :  was something again I wouldn't wish upon anyone but I also got a chance to witness what well-trained
*13:00.660- 13:07.360* :  law enforcement officers do to run toward gunfire as those of us who were in the path of gunfire
*13:07.740- 13:13.560* :  were able to run away that is something that we witnessed today too with the brave courageous
*13:14.080- 13:19.940* :  secret service officers and there's one thing that that always kind of intertwines these events
*13:19.980- 13:27.060* :  it's you just don't know what happened if you weren't there and as I'm listening to some of your
*13:27.060- 13:34.740* :  guests who were on the ground I will say to your viewers trust them trust what they saw because
*13:34.740- 13:41.840* :  they were on the ground witnessing these things and it's going to take a while to figure out who did
*13:41.840- 13:48.440* :  this what actually happened where the shots were fired from but the best thing you can do at this
*13:48.440- 13:53.640* :  point in the investigation is to listen to the people who personally witnessed what happened
*13:55.200- 14:01.220* :  well some other lines that have emerged as we record this podcast are Steven Chung Donald Trump
*14:01.220- 14:06.720* :  spokesperson has said President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for that quick
*14:06.720- 14:13.180* :  action during this heinous act he is fine and is being checked out by a local medical facility more
*14:13.180- 14:18.340* :  details will follow the White House says Joe Biden is receiving a briefing on the incident
*14:18.340- 14:23.740* :  from the heads of the U.S. Secret Service and Homeland Security Department the leader of the
*14:23.740- 14:28.620* :  Republicans in the Senate Mitch McConnell says he's grateful Trump appears to be fine and that
*14:28.620- 14:34.280* :  violence has no place in U.S. politics the Democratic leader of the House Hakeem Jeffries
*14:34.280- 14:40.120* :  said my thoughts and prayers are with former president Trump and Chuck Schumer the Democratic
*14:40.120- 14:45.600* :  leader in the Senate said he was horrified by the incident and relieved that Mr. Trump
*14:45.600- 14:52.520* :  is safe well our correspondent Gary Donahue has been speaking to more people at the rally one of
*14:52.520- 14:58.220* :  them is Greg who was outside the venue and he says he spotted the gunman and told the secret
*14:58.220- 15:04.320* :  service but they didn't pay any attention until after the shots were fired we had a party here all day
*15:04.320- 15:09.480* :  at the Brinkles Farming Greenhouse here and we all decided hey you know when we hear Trump up
*15:09.480- 15:14.240* :  there we're going to walk up through the field stand by the trees up there under the shade
*15:14.980- 15:18.620* :  and watch and listen to the rally right we couldn't see him but we could hear him
*15:20.120- 15:26.400* :  so we walked up and probably five to seven minutes of Trump speaking I'm estimating here
*15:26.400- 15:35.340* :  I have no idea you know but we noticed the guy crawling arm you know bear crawling up the roof
*15:36.080- 15:42.280* :  of the building beside us 50 50 feet away from us so we're standing there you know we're pointing
*15:42.280- 15:47.400* :  we're pointing at the guy crawling up the roof and he had a gun right he had a rifle we could clearly
*15:47.400- 15:53.860* :  see him with a rifle absolutely we're pointing at him the police are down there running around on
*15:53.860- 15:59.020* :  the ground we're like hey man there's guy on the roof with the rifle and the police are like
*15:59.020- 16:03.300* :  oh what you know like like they didn't know what was going on you know we're like hey right here
*16:03.300- 16:07.020* :  on the roof we can see him from right here we see him you know he's he's crawling
*16:08.400- 16:12.680* :  and next thing you know I'm like I'm thinking to myself I'm like why is Trump still speaking
*16:12.680- 16:18.180* :  why have they not pulled him off the stage I'm standing there pointing at him for you know two
*16:18.180- 16:23.080* :  three minutes secret services looking at us from the top of the barn I'm pointing at that roof
*16:23.680- 16:29.560* :  just standing there like this and next thing you know five shots ring out so you're you're
*16:29.560- 16:35.900* :  certain that the shots came from that guy on the roof 100% 100% and he he was up there for a couple
*16:35.900- 16:39.940* :  of minutes he was up there for a couple of minutes absolutely at least three or four minutes and
*16:39.940- 16:44.060* :  you were telling yep police in the secret service we were telling the police we were pointing at him
*16:44.060- 16:48.140* :  for the secret service who were looking at us from the top of the barn they were looking at us the
*16:48.140- 16:52.720* :  whole time and we were standing by that tree could they for noculars could they see probably not
*16:52.720- 16:58.360* :  because the roof the way the the slope went he was behind where they could see but but why is
*16:58.360- 17:02.480* :  they're not secret service on all of these roofs here I mean this is not a big place
*17:03.480- 17:08.340* :  did you see I mean obviously everyone when the shooting started everyone was very panic you're
*17:08.340- 17:15.000* :  pretty sure they they shot the guy absolutely 100% yep you saw that happen yep yep okay yep and did
*17:15.000- 17:20.840* :  you see them go up to him afterwards or they yeah they crawled up on the roof they had their guns
*17:20.840- 17:26.900* :  pointed out and make sure he was dead he was dead and that was it it was over and that's all
