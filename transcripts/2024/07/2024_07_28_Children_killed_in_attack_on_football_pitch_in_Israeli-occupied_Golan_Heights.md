*01:19.360- 01:25.500* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Jackie Leonard and in the
*01:25.500- 01:30.780* :  early hours of Sunday, the 28th of July, these are our main stories. Israel has blamed
*01:30.780- 01:35.920* :  Hezbollah for a rocket attack in the occupied Golan Heights that has killed at least 12 people,
*01:35.920- 01:41.460* :  the deadliest cross-border incident in the North since October. Hezbollah has issued a denial.
*01:41.460- 01:47.500* :  Donald Trump says he'll carry on holding outdoor rallies despite advice not to from the US
*01:47.500- 01:52.760* :  Secret Service. And the world football authorities have punished the reigning women's Olympic
*01:52.760- 01:56.120* :  Champions Canada for spying on rivals with a drone.
*01:58.340- 02:07.220* :  Also in this podcast, it shows machinery and living conditions of mining before industrialisation
*02:07.220- 02:13.940* :  and afterwards. A golden silver mine in Japan has been added to UNESCO's World Heritage Register.
*02:18.260- 02:23.560* :  We begin in the Middle East. A football pitch in a remote town in the Israeli occupied Golan
*02:23.560- 02:29.660* :  Heights has been hit by a rocket attack, killing at least 12 teenagers and young adults.
*02:29.660- 02:35.220* :  It's the worst single attack on Israel's northern border since the start of the Gaza war
*02:35.220- 02:40.120* :  last October. At a news briefing, the spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces
*02:40.120- 02:46.520* :  Daniel Hagari insisted Hezbollah was behind Saturday's attack and said the Israeli military
*02:46.520- 02:53.480* :  was preparing its response. The Chisbala terrorist organisation in Lebanon fired a rocket
*02:54.300- 03:04.940* :  at children playing soccer in a soccer field in Majdul Shams in northern Israel. Chisbala then lied
*03:04.940- 03:10.920* :  to the whole world and claimed they did not carry out this attack. This is a lie.
*03:11.680- 03:17.140* :  Our correspondent Barbara Platt Asher, who's in Jerusalem, told us more about what Hezbollah is saying.
*03:17.660- 03:22.260* :  Chisbala has categorically denied that it's behind the rocket attack on Majdul Shams
*03:22.500- 03:28.400* :  and says that those are lies of the enemy to blame it. But it did claim at least four attacks
*03:28.400- 03:33.360* :  earlier in the evening before the scale of the Majdul Shams attack became clear. This was in
*03:33.360- 03:39.720* :  response to Israeli strikes that had killed four militants in Lebanon. And the Israeli army is
*03:39.720- 03:44.760* :  saying that it is absolutely convinced it was Hezbollah. They've sent out a graphic showing from
*03:44.760- 03:50.120* :  where the strike was launched, which is north. It's in Lebanon, but it's just north of Majdul Shams
*03:50.120- 03:56.340* :  and it's almost in the direct line of fire. And in between the launch place and the village
*03:56.340- 04:02.580* :  is an Israeli army base, which Hezbollah had said that it was targeting. So that suggests that
*04:02.580- 04:08.340* :  it's a possibility that a Hezbollah rocket might have gone astray and hit the wrong target,
*04:08.480- 04:13.840* :  although as I said, Hezbollah is denying that. And what it did was it hit a village of Arab
*04:13.840- 04:19.600* :  Druze, Syrian Arab Druze, because this is occupied Golan Heights, which was taken from Syria in the
*04:19.600- 04:25.080* :  1967 war. But there is a Druze community also in Lebanon, which could be quite angry about something
*04:25.080- 04:29.460* :  like this. And there might be a backlash against Hezbollah if it seemed to have targeted such a
*04:29.460- 04:34.560* :  community. And what do you think the wider implications of this strike could be, therefore?
*04:34.800- 04:40.040* :  Well, there's always been a fear that the war in Gaza between Hamas and Israel is going to
*04:40.040- 04:45.920* :  ignite a wider regional war. And Hezbollah had been drawn into that or had inserted itself into
*04:45.920- 04:51.400* :  that shortly after the October 7th Hamas attacks. And so the Israel had started firing rockets
*04:51.400- 04:57.500* :  at Israel, saying that it was acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. And up until now, you've
*04:57.500- 05:03.440* :  seen the cross-border strikes as well as the rhetoric escalating at various times, but always
*05:03.440- 05:09.280* :  avoiding an all-out war. But there was a great concern, especially from Israel's allies, that
*05:09.300- 05:15.040* :  at a certain point either side would miscalculate. And so the fear now is that this might be the
*05:15.040- 05:20.860* :  miscalculation. We've had quite strong statements from the Israelis saying that they will act,
*05:20.860- 05:25.380* :  they will restore full security on the northern border. These ready prime minister has said
*05:25.380- 05:31.760* :  that Hezbollah will pay a heavy price. The kind it has not paid so far. We even had a rare
*05:31.760- 05:37.040* :  statement from the Lebanese government in Beirut, which usually stays out of this, saying that it
*05:37.040- 05:41.320* :  was condemned attacks against civilians, which violated international law and urged
*05:41.860- 05:47.740* :  for a de-escalation of the situation. So there is great concern that this could escalate yet.
*05:47.740- 05:52.080* :  And the Israeli prime minister, who's in the United States, has shortened his trip by a few
*05:52.080- 05:55.680* :  hours and is coming back to Israel, and there's going to be a security cabinet meeting on Sunday
*05:55.680- 06:01.100* :  to determine what the response is going to be. That was Barbara Platasha in Jerusalem.
*06:01.940- 06:07.480* :  Earlier, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said at least 30 Palestinians have been killed,
*06:07.480- 06:12.880* :  and more than 100 injured, in an Israeli strike on a school housing displaced people.
*06:12.880- 06:18.720* :  Israel says it targeted a Hamas command and control center embedded in the building,
*06:18.720- 06:25.300* :  in Darul-Balach, in central Gaza. These people sheltering in or near the school described
*06:25.300- 06:32.920* :  the moments after the attack. We were surprised that the Israelis dropped leaflets on large residential
*06:32.920- 06:38.140* :  areas and wanted people to leave. The Israelis had previously announced that there were safe areas,
*06:38.140- 06:43.660* :  and people returned to these areas. We want a solution. Our legs are tired from being displaced,
*06:43.660- 06:49.280* :  and we have become sick from being displaced. We are asking for a solution. Now the war is
*06:49.280- 06:55.860* :  11 months old, almost a year old, and people are fleeing from Gaza to Rafa and from Han Yunus to
*06:55.860- 07:06.740* :  Darul-Balach. Enough is enough. Unfortunately, this is the fifth time that I've been displaced.
*07:06.740- 07:12.540* :  I left with my tent and took with me only my wife and children. I left the tent with my belongings
*07:12.620- 07:16.300* :  and fled, and I don't know if I will find my tent and my belongings after that.
*07:17.340- 07:22.100* :  Currently, I'm displaced on foot. I have no money, and I'm looking for a place to stay.
*07:22.780- 07:29.100* :  The Al-Uqsa Hospital in Darul-Balach is close to the site of the attack and took in many of the injured.
*07:29.760- 07:34.900* :  Alice Worsley from Med San San Juanje works as a nurse in the emergency department there.
*07:35.500- 07:40.820* :  We got about a five minute warning that there had been a blast nearby, and then very quickly,
*07:40.820- 07:47.680* :  we saw a large number of patients arriving. At the same time, many in a very critical state
*07:47.680- 07:54.900* :  were with multiple different injuries of varying severity. Some were quite evidently non-survivable
*07:54.900- 08:01.380* :  injuries, so the type of injuries that we see and we saw many today is open fractures and open
*08:01.380- 08:09.360* :  wounds of their head. We saw limb injuries, blast injuries, so amputations of limbs. We see significant
*08:09.360- 08:16.100* :  burns, so we thought it's a number of children with high body surface area percentage of burns.
*08:16.920- 08:22.160* :  Alice Worsley, an MSF nurse in Gaza. Next to the United States,
*08:22.160- 08:28.220* :  the former President Donald Trump has said he will continue to hold outdoor rallies contrary to
*08:28.220- 08:33.160* :  safety recommendations from the U.S. Secret Service following the assassination attempt in
*08:33.160- 08:39.300* :  Pennsylvania just over two weeks ago. In a post on his own social media platform, Mr. Trump said
*08:39.300- 08:44.760* :  that the Secret Service had agreed to provide increased protection and no one can be allowed to stop
*08:44.760- 08:51.000* :  free speech. So just how important are outdoor rallies for Mr. Trump's presidential campaign?
*08:51.020- 08:57.820* :  A question for our North America correspondent David Willis. They're very important to Donald Trump
*08:57.820- 09:04.420* :  indoor rallies are of course easier to police than outdoor ones because everyone in attendance has
*09:04.420- 09:11.520* :  to pass through a magnetometer. The outdoor rallies afford wider access as we saw in Pennsylvania
*09:11.520- 09:18.240* :  a couple of weeks ago when that lone gunman managed to open fire from a nearby roof. Mr. Trump
*09:18.240- 09:25.100* :  favors outdoor rallies because you can get more people in and he says the atmosphere can be more
*09:25.100- 09:31.600* :  electric. Well, he's been at another event, a Bitcoin conference and he's been talking about his
*09:31.600- 09:37.460* :  plans to grow Bitcoin in the U.S. With your help, we will save our nation, we will restore our
*09:37.460- 09:44.440* :  Republic and we will make America and Bitcoin bigger, better, stronger, richer, freer and greater
*09:44.440- 09:51.200* :  than ever before. And this is quite a change of stance on cryptocurrencies for him, isn't it?
*09:51.420- 09:56.720* :  It is. He hasn't always been a fan of cryptocurrency during his time in the White House. He
*09:56.720- 10:04.260* :  dismissed them as highly volatile and based on thin air and his conversion has come at a time when
*10:04.260- 10:11.740* :  major crypto companies are making big donations to the 2024 presidential election campaign
*10:12.320- 10:18.920* :  in a bid to stave off the sort of tough regulation that was introduced by Joe Biden. Now Mr. Trump
*10:18.920- 10:25.780* :  has vowed to ease regulatory oversight of the industry and in the speech he said that he was his
*10:25.780- 10:33.380* :  aim to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet as he put it. Now meantime, what are we to
*10:33.380- 10:40.420* :  make of remarks that Mr. Trump made at another event this time in Florida on Friday that his
*10:40.420- 10:45.980* :  supporters wouldn't have to vote again if he wins November's election? Yes, those remarks
*10:45.980- 10:51.980* :  have caused some consternation and up until a short while ago the Trump campaign hadn't responded
*10:52.060- 10:59.080* :  directly to a request for clarification. Addressing a Christian convention in Palm Beach, Florida,
*10:59.080- 11:04.400* :  Mr. Trump told supporters, Christians get out and vote just this time you won't have to do it any
*11:04.400- 11:10.180* :  more for more years and it we fix. Now Donald Trump does occasionally make these sort of remarks
*11:10.180- 11:16.220* :  only to later claim that he was joking or that the remarks were taken out of context but he told
*11:16.740- 11:24.000* :  Fox News back in December that if elected in November he would be a dictator for a day and he
*11:24.000- 11:29.380* :  sought, of course, to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election, prompting Joe Biden
*11:29.380- 11:35.980* :  and others to brand him a threat to democracy. So many will wonder what he actually means.
*11:35.980- 11:39.680* :  And meanwhile what's going on with the Harris campaign? Well, a couple of Harris has been
*11:39.680- 11:46.060* :  addressing a gathering in Massachusetts featuring the musician James Taylor in Yo-Yo Mar and
*11:46.240- 11:53.380* :  she should be taking part in a virtual rally for young voters. One of a number of Zoom rallies
*11:53.380- 11:58.540* :  that her campaign has planned and they make the point that such rallies are cheaper to organize
*11:58.540- 12:04.980* :  easier to attend and two nights ago one of these virtual rallies raised according to the organizers
*12:05.360- 12:12.400* :  more than eight million dollars for her campaign. That was David Willis. France have won the men's rugby
*12:12.400- 12:17.880* :  sevens on day one of the Paris Olympics the first gold medal for the hosts led by their
*12:17.880- 12:25.520* :  star player Antoine DuPont, France beat Fiji 28 points to seven in the final in front of 70,000
*12:25.520- 12:32.120* :  fans. As we record this podcast Australia are leading the medals table after dominating the swimming
*12:32.120- 12:38.260* :  events including gold in the women's four by 100 meters freestyle relay. Meanwhile the French
*12:38.260- 12:43.300* :  authorities are still trying to work out who was behind coordinated sabotage attacks on the
*12:43.300- 12:49.100* :  high-speed rail network just hours before Friday's opening ceremony. The French interior minister
*12:49.100- 12:54.520* :  said foreign involvement couldn't be ruled out but expressed confidence investigators would
*12:54.520- 13:01.060* :  know fairly quickly who was responsible. The transport minister Patrice Fercreet warned fans to
*13:01.060- 13:07.600* :  continue to expect some delays. So there's no problem about supporters coming to Paris in the next
*13:07.600- 13:14.040* :  couple of days. I think there will be some disturbances tomorrow for the time being we will be on
*13:14.040- 13:18.920* :  high alert in terms of supervising the network and then we'll see afterwards.
*13:19.580- 13:23.720* :  Our correspondent in Paris Andrew Harding told us more about developments on Saturday.
*13:24.340- 13:30.100* :  I've been at Paris railway stations today and there are delays or maybe an hour or two here and
*13:30.100- 13:36.180* :  there. About two-thirds of trains are running normally certainly from Montpain-Nasse, one of the
*13:36.180- 13:42.580* :  big stations that was badly affected yesterday and there is a reassurance from the authorities that
*13:42.580- 13:47.600* :  they will have things pretty much backed and normal certainly by the end of the weekend. Although
*13:47.600- 13:54.800* :  interestingly the transport minister said this afternoon that he had a thousand railway workers
*13:54.800- 14:02.780* :  backed by drones and police helicopters checking all of the rail network across France for other
*14:02.780- 14:09.880* :  signs of potential sabotage. So this is clearly something that is still ongoing and you know people
*14:09.880- 14:16.520* :  are still on high alert. And what's been done to work out who was behind the attacks? And what
*14:16.520- 14:23.520* :  should we read into the suggestion of the possibility of foreign involvement? Well I think what you're
*14:23.520- 14:27.920* :  referring to there is the interior minister, Gerald Daman, saying that he couldn't rule that out.
*14:27.920- 14:32.900* :  He couldn't rule it in or out at this stage. Interestingly though he said that
*14:32.900- 14:39.200* :  they had recovered already some useful evidence that should allow them pretty soon to determine
*14:40.100- 14:45.240* :  who was behind this attack, whether it was something organized by local groups, possibly
*14:45.240- 14:49.940* :  people are starting to talk about far left extremist groups, possibly far right groups,
*14:50.160- 14:55.060* :  or whether this was something sponsored or organized from abroad.
*14:55.700- 15:00.820* :  Major security still in place. This must be one of the most highly policed games.
*15:01.860- 15:07.040* :  It is although you know the mood has changed. I think so much tension had built up around
*15:07.040- 15:13.320* :  the opening ceremony because it was unprecedented because it was right through the centre of Paris
*15:13.840- 15:20.280* :  along four miles of the river Sen and a feeling that you know something could always go wrong
*15:20.280- 15:25.440* :  in an open environment like that and it involved you know tens of thousands of police.
*15:25.720- 15:31.100* :  Now that's out of the way. The mood I was just walking along the the river bank myself
*15:31.100- 15:36.680* :  earlier today in the drizzle and things have changed. The police look much more relaxed.
*15:36.700- 15:41.960* :  There's still a huge police presence. In fact there was a time trial cycle race going on when I was
*15:42.000- 15:46.980* :  there and there were just crowds milling around and everyone seemed to be having a great time.
*15:46.980- 15:52.940* :  So I think there is touch wood a feeling that having got over that first hurdle things can become
*15:52.940- 15:58.340* :  a little more normal now even though there are events scattered across the capital. They are
*15:58.740- 16:06.220* :  tend to be isolated behind fairly secure enclosures and the rest of the city feels a bit more
*16:06.220- 16:12.660* :  ordinary now. I was Andrew Harding. The World Football Federation FIFA has deducted six points
*16:12.660- 16:17.700* :  from the Canadian team at the Olympic Women's Football Tournament following the flying of a drone
*16:17.700- 16:23.700* :  to spy on New Zealand's training session on Monday war and ball reports. Canada are the
*16:23.700- 16:28.100* :  reigning Olympic champions and there was little surprise when they beat New Zealand 2-1 in their
*16:28.100- 16:33.300* :  opening group match on Thursday but New Zealand then complained that Canadian coaching staff had
*16:33.300- 16:38.300* :  used the drone to observe their training sessions. FIFA has now suspended the manager of Bev
*16:38.300- 16:43.860* :  Prisman from taking part in any football related activity for a year along with her assistant
*16:43.860- 16:49.620* :  and analyst. FIFA said they'd engaged in offensive behaviour and violated the principles of
*16:49.620- 16:56.160* :  fair play. Warren Ball. Hungary's Prime Minister Victor Orban has accused the European Union of
*16:56.160- 17:02.540* :  having a pro-war policy on Ukraine. He told an annual summer camp of his supporters held in
*17:02.540- 17:08.080* :  neighbouring Romania that both Kiev and Moscow wanted to continue fighting and that peace
*17:08.080- 17:13.540* :  must be brought from the outside. The right-wing politician whose country currently holds the EU
*17:13.540- 17:19.960* :  presidency again implied that the person to do this will be Donald Trump whose victory he hoped for
*17:19.960- 17:26.380* :  in November's U.S. election. Mr Orban also said that Europe was suffering from economic and moral
*17:30.300- 17:34.820* :  collapse. European politics has collapsed. Europe has given up defending its own interests.
*17:35.400- 17:40.620* :  All Europe is doing today is unconditionally following the U.S. Democratic Party's foreign policy
*17:40.620- 17:47.900* :  even at the cost of self-destruction. The BBC's Nick Thorpe, who's in Budapest,
*17:47.980- 17:53.200* :  told us more about Mr Orban's remarks. He said Europe is on the wrong path in terms of
*17:53.400- 17:59.500* :  supporting Ukraine unconditionally with weapons and so on. And he said also he feels that
*17:59.500- 18:05.320* :  histories will prove him right. He does see a change. He'd recently been on what he called a
*18:05.320- 18:10.660* :  peace mission to Kiev, Moscow, Beijing and Washington. And he said that after that,
*18:10.660- 18:16.140* :  even President Zelensky spoke to Donald Trump. So he feels that even though he's in a minority
*18:16.240- 18:21.380* :  here in Europe now, he feels that he's slowly winning the argument around the world.
*18:21.760- 18:27.380* :  And he said that both Kiev and Moscow want to continue fighting and that peace must be brought
*18:27.380- 18:33.980* :  from the outside. What did he mean? You know, from his own conversations with Vladimir Putin and
*18:33.980- 18:41.060* :  Vladimir Zelensky a couple of weeks ago that they are really at loggerheads. Both of them have their
*18:41.060- 18:47.780* :  own logic that both want to keep fighting. And that therefore the only way that peace will come
*18:47.780- 18:53.580* :  is if it's not exactly imposed but brought from the outside. Mr Orban is hoping that Donald Trump
*18:53.580- 19:00.400* :  will win the U.S. election in November. But he's also been speaking to President Erdogan in Turkey
*19:00.400- 19:07.660* :  and President Xi Jinping in China. So he feels in a way that really he's siding with the rest
*19:07.660- 19:15.440* :  of the world against the current EU and current U.S. policy and that peace is possible and will
*19:15.440- 19:21.960* :  be brought about if Donald Trump wins the elections in the U.S. in November. Now Hungary currently
*19:21.960- 19:28.540* :  holds the EU presidency. Just explain for our listeners how significant it is that Hungary currently
*19:28.540- 19:33.940* :  holds that role and how significant it is that Mr Orban is taking this stance. It's a symbolic
*19:33.940- 19:40.340* :  role but it gives Hungary the chance to set the agenda and clearly Mr Orban wasted no time
*19:40.680- 19:44.900* :  in trying to set the agenda. He said the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine
*19:44.940- 19:51.480* :  means for example that neither side can win. So he's using it really. The EU presidency is a podium.
*19:51.960- 19:56.620* :  Of course that was very controversial when he embarked on this great global trip because
*19:56.620- 20:02.400* :  the EU leaders were quick to say wait a minute you're not representing us. You're not representing
*20:02.400- 20:07.480* :  EU policy here. You're only representing your own policy. That was Nick Thorpe.
*20:09.680- 20:14.900* :  Still to come. Hip-hop is an accumulation of many different music genres so blues, jazz,
*20:14.900- 20:20.320* :  everything and that's why it's thriving. Why Hip-hop belongs in the World Music Festival,
*20:20.640- 20:21.040* :  WOMAD?

*21:46.220- 21:51.340* :  Next to Venezuela on Sunday the country goes to the polls. President Maduro and his
*21:51.340- 21:56.840* :  socialist party have been in part since 2013 after he took over from his mentor Hugo Chavez.
*21:57.340- 22:03.140* :  Nicolas Maduro is seeking re-election for a third six year term. He's expected to face a strong
*22:03.140- 22:07.440* :  challenge from the opposition candidate Ed Mondo Gonzales who was ahead in the polls.
*22:08.220- 22:13.580* :  Our South America correspondent Ioni Wells is in the capital Caracas. She's been meeting voters
*22:13.580- 22:20.300* :  who say the last few years have been marred by security forces committing abuses and a warning
*22:20.300- 22:24.140* :  that this report contains some vivid descriptions of violence.
*22:30.620- 22:36.420* :  You already have our president who we have known for so many years. We continue to bet on him.
*22:36.780- 22:38.040* :  We continue to support him.
*22:40.340- 22:45.220* :  It's the last day of election campaigning in Venezuela today and the center of Caracas is
*22:45.220- 22:52.120* :  full of thousands of people who have turned out in Maduro t-shirts. There are pictures of him
*22:52.120- 22:57.100* :  absolutely everywhere lining the streets, bands playing on stages to whip up the crowds
*22:57.820- 23:01.840* :  and the streets are lined with coaches that have been put on by the government to transport people
*23:01.840- 23:05.580* :  from all around of the country to come and support him on the final day of campaigning.
*23:09.740- 23:14.560* :  Last elections were seen as neither free nor fair. For the first time in years,
*23:14.560- 23:19.960* :  the opposition has huge momentum, but President Maduro's party has used a range of tactics
*23:19.960- 23:23.960* :  to suppress the opposition with the army and electoral authorities it controls.
*23:27.160- 23:31.140* :  Disinviting EU election observers, banning opposition leaders from running,
*23:31.640- 23:32.440* :  detaining critics.
*23:37.340- 23:41.640* :  Emma Lendres, Benitez, was arbitrarily detained in Venezuela in August 2018
*23:41.640- 23:46.680* :  after she and her taxi driver partner were arrested giving someone a ride to the city center.
*23:48.140- 23:53.240* :  Without a fair trial, she was accused of organizing a plot to kill the president and given a 30-year
*23:53.240- 23:58.480* :  prison sentence. She was pregnant. Guards beat her stomach. She had a miscarriage.
*23:58.580- 24:03.520* :  A family member spoke to us anonymously and we've changed her voice.
*24:07.260- 24:12.580* :  One day we were visiting her in prison. I took off her shoes and saw her nail was purple and asked
*24:12.860- 24:18.760* :  what happened to you. A lump forming her throat. Tears came to her eyes. She told me they
*24:18.760- 24:22.800* :  removed her nail with a hammer. She is one of hundreds of political prisoners in the country.
*24:23.360- 24:24.700* :  Thousands more have been detained.
*24:27.980- 24:34.400* :  For Chavez and Maduro also, everything changed because we realized how justice works in Venezuela.
*24:35.200- 24:39.700* :  They said they want to investigate her torture. In the name of God, I hope I'm new
*24:39.720- 24:41.700* :  press in the wings and for a better Venezuela.
*24:42.560- 24:44.780* :  That report by Ioni Wells in Venezuela.
*24:46.340- 24:51.060* :  The world's most powerful countries, the G20, have agreed in principle that there needs to be
*24:51.060- 24:57.000* :  a global tax on billionaires but they've stopped short of backing a proposal put forward by Brazil.
*24:57.100- 25:03.400* :  Finance ministers met in Rio de Janeiro and promised to continue discussions on how to enforce
*25:03.400- 25:08.120* :  a minimum tax on the world's wealthiest people. Harry Bly reports.
*25:08.940- 25:15.480* :  When you think billionaire or super rich, picture the recent wedding of the son of McKesh and Barney,
*25:15.480- 25:20.980* :  Asia's richest man. There were four months of celebrations leading up to the big day,
*25:20.980- 25:24.860* :  with guest lists including global business leaders, politicians,
*25:24.860- 25:30.860* :  Bollywood actors and sporting legends, who were entertained throughout the multiple pre-marriage
*25:30.860- 25:33.300* :  parties by the likes of Katie Perry.
*25:41.820- 25:44.440* :  And the Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli.
*25:50.480- 25:55.660* :  The wedding of McKesh and Barney and Radica Merchant, which also included a four-day luxury
*25:55.660- 26:03.800* :  Mediterranean cruise, is thought to have cost in the region of 132 to 156 million dollars.
*26:04.480- 26:10.360* :  And it's this kind of fortune that finance ministers from the G20 nations were discussing imposing
*26:10.360- 26:19.020* :  a tax on. Tabled by Brazil, the idea is simple, a minimum 2% tax on the 3,000 richest people.
*26:19.100- 26:26.420* :  A report commissioned by the Brazilian government says billionaires currently pay 0.3% of their
*26:26.420- 26:34.280* :  wealth in tax, so imposing a 2% tax could unlock around 250 billion dollars per year.
*26:34.780- 26:40.760* :  The proposal has so far been backed by France, Spain, South Africa, and the African Union,
*26:41.340- 26:47.880* :  but the US and Germany are skeptical. Brazil says it will make this proposal its top priority
*26:47.880- 26:51.640* :  ahead of the G20 summit in Rio in November.
*26:52.200- 26:58.840* :  Harry Bly. A remote golden silver mine on a tiny Japanese island has been added to UNESCO's
*26:58.840- 27:04.960* :  World Heritage Register. South Korea had opposed the listing of the Sado Mine, which operated for
*27:04.960- 27:10.840* :  nearly four centuries, because it was linked to the abuse of around 2,000 Koreans used as forced
*27:10.840- 27:17.400* :  labor by Japan during the Second World War. Our Asia-Pacific editor Mickey Bristo began by telling us why
*27:17.400- 27:23.480* :  South Korea had dropped its objections. Quite simply because the Japanese government says it's
*27:23.480- 27:29.260* :  going to give proper explanations about the Koreans who worked there, the conditions in which
*27:29.260- 27:34.360* :  they lived in, and the conditions which they were forced to work in. So that's why South Korea
*27:34.360- 27:39.540* :  has essentially withdrawn its objections. We've got to say as well though that the South
*27:39.540- 27:45.080* :  Queen government is a little bit skeptical about whether Japan will do that. On another occasion,
*27:45.080- 27:51.100* :  there was a coal mine, another island, this coal mine was an island, another island is coal mine
*27:51.100- 27:57.000* :  off the coast of Japan. It too was given world heritage status. They need to promise to give full
*27:57.000- 28:02.960* :  play to descriptions of the Koreans who were forced to work there, but it didn't actually do that
*28:02.960- 28:07.440* :  the Japanese government, and they were criticized for that. So the Korean government is a little bit
*28:07.440- 28:13.860* :  skeptical whether this will actually take place. So obviously this is part of what can be quite a
*28:13.860- 28:19.400* :  difficult relationship between these two countries. We're talking about Japan taking over and
*28:19.400- 28:25.500* :  ruling Korea from 1910 until the end of the Second World War. Lots of Koreans treated very badly
*28:25.500- 28:31.260* :  by the Japanese, most notably women who were forced into prostitution to serve the soldiers of
*28:31.260- 28:38.520* :  the Imperial Japanese Army. Lots of forced labor. And South Korea, basically this is an issue which
*28:38.520- 28:42.780* :  is still hurting. It still hurts them because they don't believe the Japanese have properly
*28:42.860- 28:49.840* :  explained properly held their hands up to basically what they did. So this mine itself, which now
*28:49.840- 28:56.340* :  gets onto the world heritage site register, it was once one of the biggest sources of gold,
*28:56.340- 29:01.420* :  wasn't it? Tell us a bit more about it. It has a history which goes far beyond the period we're
*29:01.420- 29:07.940* :  talking about. It goes back to at least the early 1600s. The reason why it's so interesting is
*29:07.940- 29:16.820* :  because it shows machinery and living conditions of mining before industrialization and afterwards.
*29:16.820- 29:22.280* :  It's on an island, they're just off the coast, the west coast of Japan. Underneath this mountain
*29:22.280- 29:31.240* :  there is a real warring of kind of a network of tunnels stretching for hundreds and hundreds of
*29:31.240- 29:38.060* :  kilometers. And it was a really important mine over its lifetime and it closed in 1989. It
*29:38.060- 29:45.960* :  mined 78 tons of gold and more than 2,300 tons of silver. And at one point in the 17th century,
*29:45.980- 29:51.560* :  it was the biggest source of gold in the world, about 10% of the world's gold came from this
*29:51.560- 29:57.080* :  worn mine. And so it was a really important industrial site and probably for that reason alone
*29:57.080- 30:03.320* :  deserves to be on the world heritage list. Mickey Bristow. Commercial music from western countries
*30:03.320- 30:09.160* :  is not often thought of as being part of what's known as world music. Sounds from Africa and Latin
*30:09.160- 30:15.720* :  America are more often associated with the genre. But hip hop, which emerged from Afro-American
*30:15.720- 30:20.660* :  communities in inner cities, is playing an increasingly prominent role in world music.
*30:21.480- 30:26.860* :  And at this year's world music festival, Womad in the south of England, more than 10 hip hop
*30:26.860- 30:32.320* :  acts are performing. They come from as far afield as Senegal, South Africa and Europe.
*30:32.780- 30:36.120* :  The BBC's Martin Venard is at Womad and sent this report.
*30:43.060- 30:46.160* :  This is one of the traditional sounds of world music.
*30:46.780- 30:52.200* :  Cumbia from Latin America being played by a group based in France and led by a Mexican.
*30:57.040- 31:00.280* :  This is increasingly the sound of world music.
*31:01.800- 31:07.100* :  Hip hop from Senegal performed by two young women, going by the name Death Marma Death.
*31:08.780- 31:11.880* :  My name is Orin Morn and I work at real-world records.
*31:12.420- 31:18.820* :  So Orin, this year there are lots and lots of hip hop acts appearing at Womad. What do you think of that?
*31:19.340- 31:24.260* :  I think it's probably a reflection just of a general trend and music at the moment, you know.
*31:24.620- 31:29.720* :  I think as well, if you're doing a more traditional sort of sound, you've got to come with drums and
*31:29.720- 31:35.020* :  bass and guitar and keyboards and all sorts. Whereas the very nature of hip hop music is quite often
*31:35.020- 31:39.740* :  with the sound system and it's a compact way to tour, but also to get the music out there.
*31:39.920- 31:44.700* :  My name's Jessica and I'm writing for We're Play magazine. We're a Beatson culture magazine,
*31:44.700- 31:50.140* :  specifically focused on hip hop. Does it have a place at a world music festival?
*31:50.380- 31:54.920* :  I definitely think it does. Hip hop is an accumulation of many different music genres,
*31:54.920- 32:00.840* :  so blues, jazz, everything and that's why it's driving. It's always evolving, it's multifaceted,
*32:01.180- 32:03.260* :  I'm just really excited to be a part of it.
*32:03.260- 32:10.060* :  To other artists performing at Womad, think of the rise of hip hop at the festival.
*32:10.060- 32:15.880* :  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Al Barosi, I'm Italian, but I live in Jamaica all my life,
*32:16.340- 32:21.180* :  and I play a regular music. And music is like an ice cream, your pick your flavor.
*32:21.420- 32:27.900* :  You know what is good for you? I never exclude any genre. I'm a producer, I'm a recording engineer,
*32:27.900- 32:33.300* :  mixing engineer, so I work with a lot of music, right? Not only regular. So that's why I welcome
*32:33.300- 32:40.240* :  hip hop. My name is Noriko Tadano and I'm a Japanese and I play Japanese instruments called
*32:40.240- 32:49.200* :  Shami Sen. My music is very traditional and 300 years ago, people sang about their feeling,
*32:49.200- 32:55.820* :  nature, sometimes, about the job, sometimes life. Again, 21st century hip hop can express
*32:55.820- 32:59.320* :  that they're feeling as well and with a very reasonably called dancing.
*32:59.900- 33:02.900* :  Would you ever be tempted to do a bit of hip hop yourself?
*33:03.220- 33:11.160* :  I'd love to. Yeah, I'd like to dance hip hop in my 500 years old instruments. That would be cool,
*33:11.160- 33:11.740* :  don't you think?
*33:14.740- 33:19.480* :  This is the GS collective performing at one of the outdoor stages here in Womad.
*33:20.060- 33:25.820* :  They're a UK hip hop act, so let's ask somebody to proud here what they think of hip hop being
*33:25.820- 33:31.860* :  performed in a world music festival. You want a family event and you want your kids and your
*33:31.860- 33:36.020* :  teenagers to come. It's a really good idea to include things that they think are cool,
*33:36.360- 33:40.340* :  so they can then go on and discover other stuff that isn't on their normal radar.
*33:41.000- 33:45.000* :  What we're just listening to you right now, if you listen to your hip hop, yeah, there's the
*33:45.540- 33:50.700* :  spoken word, but there's also Jen in there. You know, I hear the saxophone there.
*33:51.960- 33:56.140* :  Hip hop can be so many things, right? It can include all sorts of impulsies, and that's what
*33:56.500- 33:57.880* :  music is all about, isn't it?
*34:00.320- 34:05.160* :  You mind the fact that there's at least 10 acts at this year's Womad, the play hip hop.
*34:05.300- 34:08.760* :  Is that matter? Much prefer so than the folk and the African beatster.
*34:10.600- 34:16.720* :  Hey, I'm Shaka Zulu. I'm part of the GS Collective. Fundamentally, hip hop is world music.
*34:16.940- 34:23.040* :  It may be seen as Western music, but it's influenced by African music, Caribbean music.
*34:24.060- 34:25.040* :  It's everything, really.
*34:37.760- 34:39.320* :  That report by Martin Venard.
*34:41.740- 34:45.660* :  And that's it from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later,
