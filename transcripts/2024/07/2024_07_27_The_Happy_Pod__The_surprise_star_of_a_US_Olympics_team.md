*01:19.040- 01:22.080* :  This is the happy pod from the BBC World Service.
*01:26.100- 01:32.320* :  I'm Janet Joliel, and in this edition, uploaded on Saturday the 27th of July, the surprising star
*01:32.320- 01:39.220* :  of the US Olympic team. He's very intuitive with people. He will scoot a little closer,
*01:39.480- 01:44.120* :  or he might put a paw on their leg or some of the gymnasts talk to beacon.
*01:44.980- 01:49.120* :  A therapy dog helping some of the world's top gymnasts deal with the pressure.
*01:49.840- 01:54.040* :  The woman who found joy riding across Africa on a motorcycle.
*01:54.820- 02:00.440* :  I do not want to live the basic everyday life. I want something extra, something more for myself,
*02:00.440- 02:06.660* :  because I love challenges. I've had the best time of my life on this trip. My fears keep me alive.
*02:07.560- 02:12.460* :  And? Zanta, having wonderful genetics that are worth preserving,
*02:12.500- 02:18.080* :  we know that she can't breed. The great thing about this is that Zanta will be represented
*02:18.080- 02:25.020* :  in future generations of Rhino. How a new type of IVF is helping to ensure the future of threatened
*02:25.020- 02:32.340* :  wild rhinos. Also in this podcast, a woman making history in Paris. If you're lucky enough to find
*02:32.340- 02:36.100* :  something that you love, then you just have to work, because it's not just going to happen
*02:36.800- 02:44.020* :  out of the blue, but do it 100% and you'll do it well. We'll hear from the first Olympic equestrian
*02:44.020- 02:50.580* :  eventor from the Arab world, and we'll find out about the couples competing in the city of love.
*02:55.740- 02:59.980* :  With the Olympics now underway in Paris, we'll be bringing you a range of stories connected
*02:59.980- 03:05.380* :  to the games. And in recent years, there's been a growing focus on athlete's mental health
*03:05.380- 03:11.720* :  and wellbeing, especially in sports with lots of young competitors. Well, USA Gymnastics has
*03:11.720- 03:18.580* :  found a novel way to help ease stress and anxiety, therapy dogs, and there's one in particular
*03:18.580- 03:20.220* :  who's stealing the limelight.
*03:25.920- 03:31.860* :  Beacon, the four-year-old golden retriever, has even been given the official title of the team's
*03:32.220- 03:37.820* :  Goodest Boy. The happy pod's Holly Gibbs spoke to Beacon's owner and handler, who's also a former
*03:37.820- 03:45.200* :  gymnast and coach Tracy Callahan Molner. Beacon is a golden retriever, and he's sort of a medium
*03:45.200- 03:52.720* :  golden color. Beacon has a black nose, and he has a big blocky head, and he just has a friendly
*03:52.720- 03:59.260* :  look about him. He's hard to say no to sometimes, for sure. What made you want to get into pet therapy?
*03:59.700- 04:07.220* :  I had a previous dog, also a golden retriever named Tulsa. I saw how much he really enjoyed people,
*04:07.220- 04:15.000* :  and as importantly, I saw how people reacted to him. When Tulsa was about six years old, my
*04:15.000- 04:19.760* :  husband was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the times when he would receive chemotherapy,
*04:19.900- 04:26.280* :  they provided pet therapy. We both experienced the pet therapy. It wasn't only for David, but for me
*04:26.280- 04:31.240* :  as well, but I also watched how much it helped David while he was going through his treatment,
*04:31.460- 04:38.840* :  and we knew that this was something that Tulsa would be very good at. We actually started doing
*04:38.840- 04:48.120* :  pet therapy at that cancer center. When I got Beacon, I hoped and hoped that he would also want to
*04:48.120- 04:54.480* :  be involved in pet therapy. He really sort of cut out for this. It's really his nature. He
*04:55.300- 05:01.960* :  loves meeting people, and I think also he's very intuitive with people. He will just gravitate
*05:01.960- 05:09.560* :  to a person, and he will scoot a little closer, or he might put a paw on their leg, or he's wanting
*05:09.560- 05:16.380* :  to get their attention to say, focus on me, pet me. I have to ask because I grew up around breeds
*05:16.380- 05:22.140* :  similar to Beacon, and I know as lovely as they are, they do have their moments of misbehaving.
*05:22.900- 05:26.940* :  Does he have any of these moments? Oh, the truth comes out.
*05:28.540- 05:35.080* :  Living in Southern California, we have a lot of olive trees. No matter what, he knows I'm always
*05:35.080- 05:40.320* :  going to tell him to spit it out, and he spits it out, but it doesn't stop him from every single
*05:40.320- 05:45.080* :  olive. He will scoop it up, but I can just tell by the posture of his head that he's got something
*05:45.080- 05:48.640* :  in his mouth, and I'll just say spit it out, and sure enough, out comes the olives.
*05:49.080- 05:53.660* :  What does Beacon do if an athlete is getting stressed and a need of some help from him?
*05:53.860- 05:57.760* :  I feel like the best interaction and the best therapy happens when I'm quiet,
*05:57.760- 06:04.360* :  and just let the two of them have their time together, and that might mean the gymnast
*06:04.360- 06:09.500* :  just petting Beacon. Some of the gymnasts talk to Beacon. Some of the gymnasts might talk to
*06:09.500- 06:17.280* :  me as well. I think in general, he's just very engaged with whoever he's with. And do you think
*06:17.280- 06:24.740* :  it has improved the mental well-being of the team? I would say, yes, hearing what some of the
*06:24.740- 06:31.220* :  gymnasts are saying about Beacon was the best thing that USA Gymnastics has done for us,
*06:31.220- 06:37.560* :  or one of our women's gymnasts said, thank God for Beacon. Do you think this is something that
*06:37.560- 06:44.400* :  all sports or competitive atmospheres should have? A resounding yes. I think we've known it
*06:44.400- 06:51.940* :  always, the importance of mental health just in life, but in sport as well. And this is one
*06:51.940- 06:57.220* :  modality of the way to offer that support. And so while it might not be everybody's first choice,
*06:57.780- 07:05.420* :  why not give it as an option? And hopefully other sports and hopefully other countries are taking
*07:05.420- 07:10.020* :  note. How does it feel when you see Beacon helping someone? Do you feel proud of him?
*07:10.300- 07:14.580* :  Yes. And I felt like I knew where your question was going. And I started to get choked up
*07:15.300- 07:24.140* :  immediately. It is such a wonderful feeling for me because I see it really across the board as a
*07:24.140- 07:32.460* :  win-win. I don't see any negatives to it. Beacon loves it. I love it for Beacon. The gymnasts love it.
*07:32.600- 07:38.260* :  The coaches love it for their gymnasts. To know that Beacon is making a difference, I could not be
*07:38.260- 07:44.180* :  happier. I am extremely grateful to be able to do that. That was Tracy Callahan Malna talking
*07:44.180- 07:49.460* :  about her therapy dog, Beacon. And you can see pictures of him on the BBC News website.
*07:50.580- 07:56.460* :  Now to the remarkable story of a woman who's travelled solo across Africa from east to west
*07:56.520- 08:04.100* :  on a motorbike. Udo Ibede Joy spent three months covering the 90,000 kilometers from Kenya to her
*08:04.100- 08:10.560* :  home country of Nigeria. She travelled through 10 countries including Uganda, Zambia and Angola
*08:10.980- 08:16.560* :  before arriving at her final destination to cheers and applause from a crowd of well wishes.
*08:17.280- 08:20.800* :  She told Alan Kasooja why she'd been inspired to make the journey.
*08:34.140- 08:40.040* :  Experience before in the past and it's made me decide that I will leave my life to the fullest,
*08:40.040- 08:44.180* :  leaving my life to the fullest. For me, it means travelling and it makes me feel alive all the time.
*08:44.180- 08:48.500* :  So yes, I wanted something more. I wanted to feel good. I wanted to feel like I am in this world
*08:48.500- 08:53.540* :  and not doing anything basic. I don't think any two days were the same. Certainly not from watching
*08:53.540- 09:01.060* :  new videos. Tell me that feeling of just being on the road. It's an unnerving feeling. There are times
*09:01.060- 09:06.000* :  I would write true forests for several hours and I would be the only one. And then I'm always
*09:06.000- 09:10.880* :  scared on curves. I'm slowing down because I don't know what I'll see. I could see it. I could see
*09:10.880- 09:17.320* :  a wild animal on the road. So yes, it has been a very scary experience. What's really really
*09:17.320- 09:22.660* :  adventurous. I've had the best time of my life on this trip. My fears keep me alive.
*09:22.940- 09:27.300* :  Tell me about when you're fed by a group of women. Where was that? A huge pot of food,
*09:27.300- 09:31.720* :  rice, meat, I saw a video of you. It's a clearly like a settlement in the middle of the forest.
*09:31.720- 09:36.700* :  It was like a restaurant-type place. There were so many of them there. So I think they were
*09:36.700- 09:42.240* :  fascinated about it all the motorcycle. So it felt good to eat and to see people. When I saw
*09:42.240- 09:45.820* :  people, I was so happy. I kept screaming. Oh, there is a video. Yes, every day. I was so happy.
*09:46.120- 09:49.580* :  And then you get to Angola. You get a lot of love from other bikers.
*09:53.580- 09:56.600* :  What does it mean for you to be able to rely on those people?
*09:57.000- 10:01.540* :  It means a lot. I got a lot of help from bikers in different ways. It's like a small community.
*10:01.540- 10:05.100* :  No matter where you are, if you get the right connection, you can meet any
*10:05.100- 10:09.040* :  biker anywhere. It's a small community of love because it's like we are going through
*10:09.040- 10:14.140* :  this struggle together and helping ourselves out of this struggle together. It was a great feeling.
*10:16.100- 10:20.440* :  Stereotypes. A woman on a bike? Did that attract any negativity?
*10:21.020- 10:25.220* :  I think it's been mostly positive for me. Yes, people notice I'm a woman. That is very,
*10:25.220- 10:28.860* :  very common. Like, immediately I move my helmets. People are coming around me. A lot of
*10:28.860- 10:34.160* :  children, a lot of people on the road. But I've not experienced anything negative. I travel
*10:34.160- 10:38.480* :  in the most secure way. And when people see me, people want to favor me. People are fascinated
*10:38.480- 10:43.820* :  about a girl on a bike being a female biker. I've not had anybody experience from it.
*10:44.060- 10:46.900* :  Victoria Falls, you saw that. I'm so jealous. How did that feel?
*10:51.280- 10:54.900* :  You're jealous. I like that hair. It felt great. You should kiss it sometime.
*10:57.100- 11:00.620* :  It felt so good because I had heard about Victoria Falls forever.
*11:00.860- 11:05.380* :  You put a lot of women on the map, women like you, African women who are aspiring to do this
*11:05.440- 11:09.280* :  stuff. How does that make you feel? Does it come with a weight of elation? Have you really
*11:09.280- 11:10.820* :  screamed that said? Yes!
*11:13.420- 11:16.280* :  Of course, when I got to Nigeria, that was something else. So, when I arrived,
*11:16.280- 11:21.400* :  I couldn't hold back my tears because the bikers were with me for me there and then the dancers and
*11:28.120- 11:32.580* :  everything. I just kept screaming and jumping. I couldn't contain my excites. I saw people
*11:32.580- 11:38.080* :  cheering, hooting up placards, singing, jumping and dancing. I'm like, where did these people come
*11:38.080- 11:43.900* :  from? It was such a good time to experience that with people. Yes, I felt good. I felt
*11:44.300- 11:47.000* :  good to be home. Home felt. Me is done. So good.
*11:48.020- 11:55.120* :  Udo, a birdie joy speaking to Alan Kosuja about an epic journey. Now, to a scientific breakthrough
*11:55.120- 12:01.340* :  that could hopefully ensure the survival of a threatened species, only around 15,000 southern
*12:01.340- 12:06.340* :  white rhinos exist in the wild in Africa. But a team of researchers is trying to help them
*12:06.340- 12:12.480* :  breed using IVF, with eggs harvested from their relatives at zoos across Europe. Our science
*12:12.480- 12:16.560* :  editor Rebecca Morrell has been to Dublin Zoo in Ireland to find out more.
*12:21.160- 12:26.460* :  Santa is a 22-year-old southern white rhino and she's about to undergo a medical procedure.
*12:27.140- 12:31.580* :  Scientists want to save her valuable genes. To do that, they're harvesting her eggs.
*12:32.360- 12:34.340* :  First, she's darted with some anaesthetic.
*12:37.300- 12:42.080* :  For the last week, she's been given special hormone injections to help her produce her eggs.
*12:42.620- 12:48.740* :  But collecting them is far from easy. It requires painstaking precision. And the team here are
*12:48.740- 12:53.920* :  looking inside her ovary on a special screen in front of them where they can locate the eggs
*12:54.000- 12:58.480* :  so they can extract them. Franco Sullivan is a vet at Dublin Zoo.
*12:59.200- 13:05.500* :  So Santa, having wonderful genetics that are worth preserving, we know from a previous
*13:05.500- 13:11.280* :  reproductive assessment that she can't breed. The main reason we want to do the procedure
*13:11.640- 13:17.260* :  is to bypass that. And if you like the great thing about this is that Santa will be represented
*13:17.260- 13:28.040* :  in future generations of rhino. The hope is that Santa's genes could help wild southern white rhinos.
*13:28.540- 13:33.900* :  At the end of the 19th century, the species was almost extinct with as few as 20 animals.
*13:34.520- 13:39.280* :  Their numbers have now recovered to thousands, but they're all descended from that tiny group,
*13:39.280- 13:45.080* :  so they lack genetic diversity. But rhinos in zoos, because of crossbreeding programs,
*13:45.080- 13:50.260* :  have genes that are more mixed up. The consequence, if you have a very narrow gene
*13:50.260- 13:55.920* :  pool is that, for example, a virus can jump from one individual through the other because each
*13:55.920- 14:01.580* :  individual is the same and the immune system acts like the same. Thomas Hildebrandt is from
*14:01.580- 14:07.320* :  the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany. His specialist team is working
*14:07.320- 14:12.800* :  with Dublin Zoo and others across Europe. It's taken Professor Hildebrandt many years to develop
*14:12.800- 14:20.220* :  this procedure. Now we try to apply this new technology to rescue Santa's genes and bring them
*14:20.220- 14:25.220* :  back to Africa, so that we have a brighter gene pool for the future.
*14:28.540- 14:33.140* :  In a makeshift lab next to the enclosure, Susanna Hildebrandt from the Leibniz team
*14:33.140- 14:38.840* :  pierced through a microscope. So we found four eggs, three of them are really in good condition,
*14:38.880- 14:45.600* :  so we hope that there's a good chance to have an embryo from them. Rhino IVF is still in its infancy,
*14:46.140- 14:50.280* :  but the plan is to now fertilise the eggs and eventually implant them in a surrogate.
*14:50.980- 14:55.260* :  It's a lot of effort. In the end, we actually come home with a few cells,
*14:56.060- 15:01.440* :  but however these cells have the potential to become embryos and to form a new rhino,
*15:01.440- 15:05.280* :  a huge two-tone animal, so it is worth it.
*15:07.820- 15:14.780* :  Not long after the procedure, Santa is up. Although she doesn't know it, her eggs could make a
*15:14.820- 15:18.600* :  big difference, ensuring the survival of future generations.
*15:23.800- 15:25.240* :  Rebecca Morrell reporting.
*15:29.040- 15:33.780* :  Coming up in this podcast, starting off being completely shut off and
*15:34.400- 15:39.460* :  closed up in my own shell and then being accepted and feeling I'm okay the way I am.
*15:40.120- 15:41.300* :  I feel a huge progression.
*15:42.240- 15:48.000* :  How museums and concerts on prescription are helping people with mental health issues in Denmark.
*15:57.060- 16:00.740* :  This is an ad by BetterHelp. How often do you compare yourself to others?
*16:00.740- 16:05.980* :  It's easy to envy friends' lives on social media, but comparison is the thief of joy,
*16:05.980- 16:11.420* :  and in reality, nobody has it all together. Online therapy can help you focus on what you want,
*16:11.420- 16:16.180* :  not what others have, because your best life is better than the idea of someone else's.

*16:29.920- 16:33.880* :  He killed at least 19 people during the 1980s in South Africa.
*16:34.240- 16:38.340* :  Very dark times. People were desperate. We were looking for him,
*16:38.420- 16:41.360* :  we couldn't find him, and nobody knew where he was.
*16:42.220- 16:44.640* :  Every single one of his victims was black.
*16:45.520- 16:48.280* :  In each such a state where he was now hunting.

*17:06.200- 17:09.340* :  Back to the Olympics and to a woman who's already made history.
*17:09.900- 17:14.980* :  Norse Laoui is the first person from North Africa or the Middle East to qualify for the horse riding
*17:14.980- 17:20.980* :  competition known as Eventing. Even from the age of 4, the Moroccan knew she wanted to become
*17:20.980- 17:25.980* :  a professional rider, a move to France at the age of 18 to make her dream a reality.
*17:26.620- 17:32.340* :  She's riding her horse, cash in hand for dressage, show jumping, and her favourite cross country
*17:32.340- 17:35.340* :  at the Chateau de Versailles just outside Paris.
*17:35.900- 17:39.760* :  Nor told Nishat Ladder how she felt about making it to the Olympics.
*17:40.760- 17:46.960* :  Well for me it's a big honor. There is a strong horsey tradition in those countries in Morocco,
*17:46.960- 17:52.880* :  there are a world and everything. So for me I'm very proud to be walking in those footsteps.
*17:53.560- 17:56.200* :  How did you get into this field?
*17:56.800- 18:01.320* :  I started out in Morocco, I just loved the animals, so I loved the
*18:01.320- 18:05.800* :  not just horses, but also mules, donkeys, everything, you know, equines, the things that
*18:05.800- 18:11.980* :  related. And my parents were very big on hiking, so we'd go hiking with the horses and mules,
*18:12.520- 18:17.260* :  up in the mountains, in the desert, and that's what really developed my passion for the
*18:17.680- 18:23.040* :  countryside, the animal nature. And then I always had this idea in my head that I wanted to
*18:23.040- 18:27.880* :  become a professional rider, but I didn't really know how, you know, going from a dream to a reality,
*18:27.880- 18:33.520* :  I didn't know what it took and how to get there. And you mentioned growing up in Morocco and going
*18:33.520- 18:38.940* :  on hikes with your family, but another real inspiration for you is your mum. Tell us about
*18:38.940- 18:45.380* :  your relationship with her and how inspirational she is for you. So she had an accident,
*18:45.380- 18:51.240* :  age 32, so she became parablegic on a wheelchair, but she didn't let that determine her life,
*18:51.240- 18:56.420* :  she just made a strength out of it. She had two kids before the accident, but then she had two
*18:56.420- 19:02.340* :  kids after the accident. And I was the first born afterwards. And she, you know, created the rehab
*19:02.340- 19:07.700* :  center for disabled people with her team. And for me, growing up in that environment to see that
*19:08.220- 19:13.220* :  truly anything is possible, that really helped me, you know, it fostered me and made me the
*19:13.220- 19:18.280* :  person I am today, I think. So yeah, from the beginning, when I was riding at very low level and
*19:18.280- 19:24.000* :  getting eliminated, she was saying, you're good at Olympics. So you have your HGV lessons.
*19:24.200- 19:30.260* :  Will you be driving cash in hand to Paris then? Well, I will actually. Wow. A woman of many
*19:30.260- 19:37.960* :  talents. And what do you hope you doing what you're doing? What do you think that says about
*19:37.960- 19:43.220* :  women in this region? I think women in this region, we are very strong
*19:43.220- 19:49.240* :  world, you know, women are not scared. We are very curious. And once we find something we love,
*19:49.580- 19:52.860* :  we just go for it. So for me, I was always raised that way, you know, if
*19:53.240- 19:57.580* :  if you're lucky enough to find something that you love, then you just have to work because it's
*19:57.580- 20:03.160* :  not just going to happen out of the blue, but do it 100%. And you know, you'll do it well. Of
*20:03.160- 20:08.660* :  course, I have still so much to learn. And but that's what I love about, you know, sports or
*20:08.660- 20:13.460* :  anything in life is that as soon as you learn more, you realize you need to learn even more.
*20:14.980- 20:21.560* :  So I'm quite looking forward to all that learning and all those experience that are to come.
*20:22.660- 20:27.460* :  And you can hear more from Norse Lowry and other Olympic and Paralympic athletes on the BBC
*20:27.460- 20:32.580* :  Sports Tower available from wherever you get your podcasts. And you can see images of her and
*20:32.580- 20:38.820* :  a beautiful horse, cash in hand on the BBC News website. Time now for a few other positive news
*20:38.820- 20:45.060* :  stories we've spotted. Early results suggest a drug commonly prescribed to thin blood could be used
*20:45.060- 20:53.240* :  as a cheap antidote to Cobra Venom. Snake bites kill about 138,000 people a year, mostly in Africa,
*20:53.240- 20:58.680* :  South and Southeast Asia. But an international team of scientists has discovered that heparin
*20:58.760- 21:05.300* :  could neutralise toxins in the venom of some spitting Cobra's. If you've ever dreamed of living
*21:05.300- 21:10.720* :  on the moon, researchers in Italy think they've found the perfect place. The team from the University
*21:10.720- 21:17.640* :  of Trento has identified the first lunar cave ever discovered and say that as it's at least 100
*21:17.640- 21:24.800* :  meters deep, it could be an ideal place for humans to build a permanent base sheltered from radiation,
*21:24.800- 21:31.260* :  extreme temperatures and space weather. They believe it could be an opening to an underground
*21:31.260- 21:37.060* :  undiscovered world made millions or even billions of years ago when lava flowed on the moon,
*21:37.060- 21:42.960* :  creating tunnels through the rock. And here in the UK, a mischievous one-year-old cat has been
*21:42.960- 21:47.680* :  identified as the culprit behind a series of thefts. Marvin's owner discovered he'd been
*21:47.680- 21:53.240* :  entering her neighbours' homes and returning with a range of stolen goods from socks and slippers
*21:53.240- 21:58.380* :  to a babygrove. Two years ago, people in Redmond in the US state of Oregon demanded their church
*21:58.380- 22:02.860* :  minister keep her two cats, Catty and Cali, inside after they went on a burglary spree.
*22:03.460- 22:07.580* :  Well, if your pets have ever stolen from your neighbours or embarrassed you in other silly ways,
*22:07.580- 22:13.780* :  do send us an email or voice note, globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*22:15.220- 22:20.620* :  Many of us find pleasure in visiting art galleries and museums, going to concerts or the theatre
*22:20.620- 22:26.420* :  or singing with others. And in Denmark, the happiness that these cultural events can bring is being
*22:26.420- 22:32.160* :  used to help those who have mental health problems. The free programme known as Culture Vitamins
*22:32.160- 22:38.420* :  or Art on Prescription runs three times a week for ten weeks and people can be referred by doctors,
*22:38.420- 22:44.520* :  counsellors and job centres. It started as a three-year pilot back in 2016 and so far,
*22:44.520- 22:49.880* :  it's had more than a thousand participants. Adrian Murray went along to find out more.
*22:52.380- 22:57.840* :  I'm tagging along with a group of eight people to see Alpo's famous street art.
*22:57.900- 23:02.800* :  So, follow me. That's Clems Renner. He works for the local municipality,
*23:03.180- 23:11.060* :  but this morning he's our guide. For the next two hours we weave our way past building spray
*23:11.060- 23:17.800* :  painted with enormous murals. There's life like portraits and edgy graffiti. Everyone here in
*23:17.800- 23:23.680* :  the group has faced struggles with their mental health, from stress and anxiety, to depression
*23:23.680- 23:31.120* :  and loneliness. I chatted with 32-year-old Lulu. I think it's been very educational and it's been
*23:31.120- 23:39.740* :  very inspiring too. At the end of the tour I caught up with Clems. They get sort of a pause from
*23:39.740- 23:45.880* :  the illness. We all take vitamins. That's something we do to get stronger. It's not a medicine.
*23:46.220- 23:51.440* :  We are not having the illusion that we are curing people from an illness, but we are doing something
*23:51.440- 23:59.760* :  to strengthen their mental health. Michael Ollennielson is the program coordinator.
*24:00.260- 24:07.020* :  I think when you step into the arena of culture and arts there's a lot of emotions and
*24:07.020- 24:13.280* :  stakes and the arts and culture make a place where there's room for all these feelings.
*24:17.220- 24:23.440* :  I also attend the rehearsals of Old Balls Orchestra. After the walk I caught up with Lulu again
*24:23.960- 24:29.540* :  to hear how she's found being on the course. She tells me that in the beginning she would wear
*24:29.540- 24:36.380* :  all black clothing and hide under sweaters. However her self-esteem has improved. I went down with
*24:36.380- 24:45.180* :  depression a long time ago and I just kind of ignored my own feelings and my own needs. Starting off
*24:45.240- 24:51.460* :  being completely shut off and closed up in my own shell and then being accepted and feeling
*24:51.460- 25:02.140* :  I'm okay the way I am that I feel huge progression. I stood in a circle around a piano. A handful of
*25:02.140- 25:08.160* :  young people are taking turns to choose songs from a book of lyrics. This scheme catered specifically
*25:08.160- 25:13.980* :  for 18 to 30 year olds and was launched two years ago and was supposed to grow in concerns about
*25:13.980- 25:21.040* :  the well-being of young people. Among the songs belted out a Danish pop classics and Scandinavian
*25:21.040- 25:30.960* :  superstars Aber. I was like oh no this is going to be scary but it's so it's a really enjoyable
*25:30.960- 25:37.960* :  and surprisingly fun experience. 20 year old did it join culture vitamins two months ago. I hadn't
*25:37.960- 25:45.080* :  been out with people in a long time. I really need routines since I have autism and it really helped
*25:45.080- 25:49.760* :  the whole waking up having to do this and I have also like made new friends.
*25:54.200- 25:58.420* :  Didda ending that report by Adrian Murray and you can hear more about this project and other
*25:58.420- 26:04.000* :  innovative ways of tackling mental health issues on people fixing the world wherever you get your
*26:04.000- 26:10.540* :  BBC podcasts. And finally with the Olympics taking place in a city known as one of the most romantic
*26:10.560- 26:15.400* :  in the world we thought we'd take a look at some of the couples who'll be competing in Paris.
*26:15.840- 26:17.760* :  Curious Madement has been finding out more.
*26:25.200- 26:31.380* :  From BMX to judo, shopper to surfing, sport star relationships can be seen across the games
*26:31.980- 26:38.660* :  and after strict COVID restrictions at Tokyo in 2020 many of the couples will finally be able to
*26:38.660- 26:45.520* :  cheer each other on in person. Fresh from Wimbledon, tennis fan favourite Alina Sviterlina and her
*26:45.520- 26:52.140* :  husband Gail Morfese will be representing Ukraine and France respectively. For the US fencing athletes
*26:52.140- 26:58.440* :  Lee Kiefer and Garrick Minehart, this will be their third Olympics as an item, their second as a
*26:58.440- 27:04.400* :  married couple. And Slovakian race walkers Hannah Bertelova and Dominic Cherny will be competing
*27:04.400- 27:10.160* :  as fiancés this year after Dominic got down on one knee at the World Athletic Championships
*27:10.160- 27:18.280* :  last August at the finish line. When one of us is maybe exhausted or tired or something is not
*27:18.280- 27:24.260* :  working as we want that's a disadvantage but on the other side when we can support each other
*27:24.420- 27:31.040* :  and we four times or harder times let's say and we can support each other so practically
*27:32.140- 27:38.420* :  it's advantage. But we also remember that the most important thing is to represent our country,
*27:38.420- 27:41.580* :  the best way and second one is our love story.
*27:44.840- 27:49.540* :  You'd think that with the pressures the event brings there be no time for date night
*27:49.540- 27:54.380* :  but with conflicting schedules and competitions around the world being the norm for athletes
*27:54.420- 28:00.620* :  the Olympics allows couples to spend a full three weeks together. Speaking in an interview with
*28:00.620- 28:05.740* :  her club by a Munich, German footballer Leia Schuller said it can sometimes feel like she's
*28:05.780- 28:11.560* :  in a long-distance relationship with her partner Lara Van Lau who sales for Austria even though
*28:11.560- 28:17.400* :  they live together. But with all this talk of couples and their romantic mini break what about those
*28:17.400- 28:25.080* :  who are single? Australian tennis players have been expressing their excitement on TikTok
*28:25.080- 28:31.180* :  about the bar in this year's Olympic Village. With bean bags and a DJ all setting the mood
*28:31.180- 28:36.240* :  it could be the perfect place to strike up the conversation with a like-minded Olympian.
*28:36.720- 28:39.840* :  Who knows who our next sporting power couple could be.
*28:49.060- 28:55.480* :  That report by Karris Matent. And that's all from the happy pod for now. We'd love to hear from

*29:29.640- 29:35.060* :  Very dark times. People were desperate. We were looking for him. We couldn't find him.
*29:35.320- 29:40.060* :  And nobody knew where he was. Every single one of his victims was black.
*29:40.920- 29:43.680* :  In each such a state where he was now hunting.
