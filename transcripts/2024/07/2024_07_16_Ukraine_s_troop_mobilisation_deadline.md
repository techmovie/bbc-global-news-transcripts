*01:24.580- 01:28.340* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:30.480- 01:36.240* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson at 39's GMT on Tuesday the 16th of July. These are our main stories.
*01:36.240- 01:41.760* :  In Ukraine, men aged between 18 and 60 are queuing at military enlistment offices
*01:41.760- 01:46.640* :  to update their personal details or face fines and possible prosecution.
*01:47.400- 01:51.480* :  It comes as the country tries to boost its forces to fight Russia's offensive.
*01:52.280- 01:57.000* :  Donald Trump receives a hero's welcome at the US Republican Convention in Wisconsin.
*02:10.340- 02:15.260* :  Also in this podcast, four people are killed and others wounded in a shooting near a mosque in
*02:15.260- 02:20.140* :  a man known as one of the most stable countries in the Middle East. And South Korea's spy
*02:20.140- 02:25.720* :  agency says a former North Korean diplomat defected with his family last November.
*02:30.540- 02:36.240* :  We start in Ukraine where men of fighting age only have today to update their contact details
*02:36.240- 02:41.020* :  with military enlistment offices. The government will impose fines and possibly
*02:41.020- 02:45.360* :  prosecute those who don't comply. The Ukrainian government is struggling to replace
*02:45.360- 02:50.720* :  battlefield losses in its ongoing war against Russia, which is well into its third year.
*02:51.180- 02:56.400* :  A correspondent in Kiev is James Waterhouse. A couple of months ago, Ukraine passed a
*02:56.400- 03:01.780* :  controversial mobilization law which widened the age of conscription where men were
*03:02.040- 03:08.720* :  would be forced to fight. It was widened between the ages of 25 and 60. So it's a pretty
*03:08.720- 03:14.700* :  wide catchment area. But this is the controversial bit. There was no cap on the amount of time
*03:14.700- 03:20.660* :  that men would have to serve for. And the reason it was viewed in such a dim light is because those
*03:20.660- 03:26.380* :  who volunteered did so long ago. And we are now at the stage of this war where men who are more
*03:26.380- 03:32.560* :  reluctant, men, or frightened, even when you speak to them, are being coerced to volunteer.
*03:32.560- 03:37.920* :  And what people tell you is that they assume they will end up in a trench and either having to kill
*03:37.920- 03:42.920* :  or be killed. And what the military is trying to say is, look, if you register your details,
*03:43.940- 03:47.640* :  we will put you in the right place and only call on you if we need you.
*03:48.300- 03:54.480* :  And so today is the deadline for all men between 18 and 60 to register their details with
*03:54.480- 03:59.600* :  enlistment centres. And we've seen queues across Kiev. And then, you know, the views of men and
*03:59.600- 04:04.060* :  the queues range from, you know, I'm happy to do this. It's pretty cool to have to five weapons
*04:04.060- 04:08.380* :  worth millions of pounds. All the way to, I have a disabled child, I can't leave them.
*04:08.940- 04:15.040* :  I really fear for the worst if I am called upon. So it suggests, although, you know, it's not a
*04:15.040- 04:19.720* :  broad bit of research, there is engagement in this process. And I think that's because of the
*04:19.720- 04:25.460* :  punishment you face, if you haven't registered, they include fines up to $600, the equivalent of
*04:25.460- 04:30.840* :  the month salary and even having your bank accounts frozen. So there is an incentive for men to
*04:30.840- 04:35.720* :  sign up. And there is a backdrop here, as you say, of Ukraine continuing to struggle to find
*04:35.720- 04:40.840* :  enough men to fight, widening its search for soldiers, as Russia continues to exercise its
*04:40.840- 04:47.100* :  its far superior strength and reserves at the moment. James Waterhouse, it was a political home
*04:47.100- 04:52.520* :  coming to a hero's welcome. At the Republican National Convention held in Milwaukee in Wisconsin,
*04:52.520- 04:58.000* :  Donald Trump made his first public appearance two days after he narrowly survived an assassination
*04:58.540- 05:03.360* :  attempt. He didn't speak, but appeared emotional, soaking up the atmosphere and repeatedly
*05:03.360- 05:09.020* :  mouthing thank you to his supporters. At the convention, Mr. Trump was formally nominated as the
*05:09.020- 05:14.360* :  parties candidate for the presidential election in November, and he named his running mate for vice
*05:14.360- 05:19.620* :  president. On North America correspondent Nomeh Igbal is in Milwaukee and sent us this report.
*05:20.740- 05:23.940* :  This convention welcome to order.
*05:26.280- 05:28.280* :  Welcome to the Donald Trump show.
*05:30.940- 05:36.060* :  With a white bandage covering his ear, Mr. Trump walked down a red carpet. He looked
*05:36.120- 05:42.100* :  tired and emotional as the audience greeted him, rapture cylinder, Jay Trump.
*05:44.820- 05:49.000* :  This basketball arena in Milwaukee has turned into a gathering of the Trump faithful
*05:50.240- 05:54.000* :  earlier in the day, his family, including son Eric Trump, arrived here.
*06:05.500- 06:10.540* :  They watched nearly two and a half thousand delegates representing all 50 states of America
*06:11.120- 06:14.000* :  to clap for Mr. Trump, who was no other competitor.
*06:17.540- 06:24.200* :  And there you have it. After all the controversy, the indictment and the convention,
*06:24.980- 06:30.760* :  the Republican party has officially nominated Donald Trump as their presidential candidate.
*06:30.760- 06:35.660* :  People are delighted. The next step will be for Donald Trump.
*06:36.140- 06:38.760* :  That's the nomination later this week.
*06:39.560- 06:43.800* :  That was amazing. It was one of the best experiences I had tears in my eyes and I haven't cried
*06:43.800- 06:50.040* :  like that since I lost my mother. He loves us all and I love Trump and I'm not ashamed to say it.
*06:50.380- 06:55.140* :  Go Trump, Trump 2024. Are we ready to nominate a vice president?
*06:56.440- 06:59.960* :  We now also know who Mr. Trump's loyal vice president will be.
*07:05.580- 07:09.800* :  It was a surprise to many who had predicted Donald Trump might go for a candidate to help him
*07:09.800- 07:14.380* :  reach moderate voters, or someone who would make inroads with Hispanic or Black voters.
*07:14.380- 07:19.300* :  This pic suggests Mr. Trump is confident he can win the election without any of that.
*07:19.300- 07:24.560* :  Mr. Vance found fame when his memoir about growing up in poverty became a Netflix movie,
*07:25.320- 07:26.460* :  but talk about a U-turn.
*07:26.640- 07:31.980* :  I'm a never-trump guy. I never liked him. Fundamentally what's going on and what Donald Trump has done
*07:31.980- 07:37.360* :  is change the focus of the white working class from a sort of engaged and constructive politics
*07:37.780- 07:39.100* :  to a politics appointing the finger.
*07:39.140- 07:42.540* :  The JD Vance America first is not just a slogan.
*07:42.920- 07:48.820* :  Now he has fallen in line with all of Mr. Trump's hardline policies and become a real attack dog for him.
*07:48.840- 07:53.680* :  We ought to investigate the prior administration. There are obviously many instances of wrong doing
*07:53.680- 07:56.980* :  and frankly the Biden administration has done far worse.
*08:00.500- 08:04.960* :  Following the assassination attempt he blamed President Biden and his campaign for what happened,
*08:04.960- 08:09.480* :  but was accused of hypocrisy, given his own division and targeting of political enemies.
*08:10.660- 08:13.700* :  Mr. President thank you for sitting down with this. There's a lot to talk about.
*08:13.960- 08:18.060* :  However Mr. Biden was challenged in a new interview regarding a comment he made,
*08:18.700- 08:21.140* :  saying it was time to put Trump in the bull's eye.
*08:21.440- 08:25.460* :  It was the mistake that he was, I didn't say crosshairs. I've been bulls eyeing it.
*08:25.460- 08:28.040* :  Focus on it. Focus on what he's doing.
*08:32.700- 08:36.220* :  When Donald Trump lost the election four years ago, there were Republicans who said they
*08:36.220- 08:40.760* :  would put him in the rear-view mirror, especially after the violence of January the 6th.
*08:41.320- 08:44.600* :  Benilia decade after Mr. Trump ascended to the top of the party.
*08:45.240- 08:49.580* :  It is very much now his party, entirely remade in his image.
*08:50.460- 08:57.280* :  Noméic Bal in Milwaukee. So why has Donald Trump chosen JD Vance as his vice president?
*08:57.280- 09:02.280* :  Rob Young has been talking to Andrew Giuliani who was special assistant to Donald Trump
*09:02.280- 09:09.280* :  when he was in the White House. Just over 48 hours from an assassination attempt that a millimeter
*09:09.280- 09:14.520* :  to the right would have taken his life, I think he looks very good. I'm sure that they might have
*09:14.520- 09:19.160* :  to be a little surgery on that ear, but from everything that I could tell he's got his hearing
*09:19.160- 09:24.980* :  and thank goodness he's not in the hospital and it's a situation where it obviously could have
*09:24.980- 09:28.200* :  been so much so much worse for the president and for the country.
*09:28.480- 09:34.260* :  Why do you think JD Vance is the best person out of all of the Republicans there are in the
*09:34.280- 09:37.960* :  United States to potentially be the vice president?
*09:38.460- 09:42.580* :  Well, I think it was a difficult decision for president Trump. If you look at his statement,
*09:42.580- 09:50.220* :  I think he does a good job of embodying that, the best that he could. I know that I've been in
*09:50.220- 09:56.600* :  many conversations with him as well as senior staff there in talking about the pros and cons
*09:56.600- 10:02.900* :  of over a dozen different potential candidates. But I think when you go and you look at the mathematics
*10:02.900- 10:09.240* :  of the electoral map and you realize that this race will come down to about nine states,
*10:09.260- 10:16.740* :  I think JD Vance helps him in three of those nine states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
*10:16.780- 10:22.980* :  I think that was the determining factor. And by the way, JD Vance was able to, I think, speak
*10:22.980- 10:30.680* :  to Americans in a way that Donald Trump was in terms of far before they ever got into the political
*10:30.680- 10:38.160* :  realm. They were able to kind of capture the American imagination in very different ways, right?
*10:38.160- 10:44.060* :  If you read Hillbilly out, LG, it's very different than the apprentice, but they were able to
*10:44.660- 10:49.980* :  capture the American intention outside of politics. And I think there's a respect from president
*10:49.980- 10:54.160* :  Trump to JD Vance because of that. Well, you say there was respect. I'm interested in
*10:54.160- 10:59.940* :  in Donald Trump's ability to forgive previous comments because JD Vance had at one point
*10:59.940- 11:04.960* :  described Donald Trump as an idiot. He said he was reprehensible and apparently in private
*11:04.960- 11:09.620* :  compared him to Adolf Hitler. Yeah, Donald Trump's forgiven all of that. Yeah, I think that's one
*11:09.620- 11:16.820* :  of the fallacies that many have told about Donald Trump and in the media over the past 10 years or so
*11:16.820- 11:23.040* :  is that Donald Trump is somebody who doesn't forgive. I've seen this time and time again where
*11:23.040- 11:29.880* :  president Trump is willing to forgive, is willing to actually do what's best for the country or for
*11:29.880- 11:35.500* :  policy or something like that. And I just go back to his meetings with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi
*11:36.120- 11:41.640* :  in the Oval Office. He hosted them numerous times. I remember one night then even having Chinese
*11:41.640- 11:48.040* :  food, I think in 2018 together after having vigorously called each other names and all that stuff.
*11:48.520- 11:53.600* :  So, you know, Donald Trump has an ability to forgive. I know there's kind of this narrative out
*11:53.600- 11:59.140* :  there that he doesn't, but I think if you look at the facts of it, he does. Andrew Giuliani,
*11:59.140- 12:05.200* :  former Special Assistant to Donald Trump. And you can get more from inside the Republican convention
*12:05.200- 12:11.920* :  from today's global story podcast, wherever you get your podcasts. In a man, four people have
*12:11.920- 12:16.640* :  been killed in several more wounded in a shooting near a mosque, an extremely rare incident of
*12:16.640- 12:21.520* :  public disorder there. I've been hearing more about the attack and what it means for a man from our
*12:21.520- 12:26.380* :  Middle East analyst, Sebastian Asher. We don't have a huge amount of information. The Amani police
*12:27.240- 12:31.240* :  have confirmed, as you were saying, that four people were killed and quite a large number of
*12:31.240- 12:36.900* :  others wounded. This is a shooting that happened near a sheer mosque in Muscat, the capital of a man.
*12:37.260- 12:44.600* :  Now, the sheer makeup, a very small part of the Amani population, about 5%. We also have heard from
*12:44.600- 12:49.980* :  the Pakistani embassy that there were Pakistanis among the wounded. There's a very large
*12:49.980- 12:56.200* :  expatriate community in Oman. And the Pakistani's obviously makeup a part of that. What we don't know
*12:56.780- 13:00.520* :  is who is responsible. We don't know what's happened to them. We don't know any motive.
*13:00.520- 13:08.060* :  I think that may take a while to come out. I mean, Oman, as you said, this is a vanishingly rare
*13:08.540- 13:15.220* :  occurrence of this nature, shooting of this kind at a mosque. And I think that the Amani's who do
*13:15.220- 13:20.900* :  keep quite a tight control on any kind of information that comes out. I think that this will come
*13:20.900- 13:28.700* :  out slowly as the Amani authorities want it to. So, as far as motive goes, we don't know, but
*13:28.700- 13:33.980* :  obviously it's caused huge shock in Oman. Well, as you said, extremely rare incident. Because Oman
*13:33.980- 13:39.780* :  is seen, as you say, as a stable and secure country in the Middle East, isn't it? It is. I mean,
*13:39.780- 13:45.220* :  it's sort of at one remove from all the main conflicts, the main kind of flash points.
*13:45.880- 13:51.240* :  Even when you go to Oman, I mean, it's very different. And it actually sells itself as a very
*13:51.240- 13:57.100* :  different sort of country from other Gulf states. Everything is very kind of low key. The way
*13:57.100- 14:04.040* :  that people dress is different. The Abadi, a strain of Islam, was the dominant form for a long time.
*14:04.040- 14:08.880* :  And it gives a different look to the way that people dress in the streets there. When you go to
*14:08.880- 14:15.620* :  Damascus, it doesn't have skyscrapers like you have in Dubai, like you have in Riyadh, in all the
*14:15.620- 14:22.620* :  other big Gulf capitals. Everything is kept to four stories and no hire. And when the long-term
*14:23.460- 14:30.080* :  leader, ruler, Sultan Kabust died in 2020, there was speculation that it might be a slightly
*14:30.080- 14:35.380* :  difficult transition, but in the end it was engineered very, very smoothly. And as you were saying,
*14:35.380- 14:40.580* :  I mean, it's a stable country and that has allowed it to play a big mediation role in lots of
*14:40.580- 14:47.480* :  the conflicts around the region, with Iran, with Yemen and so on. Sabastin Asher. Countries
*14:47.480- 14:53.200* :  across the western Balkans have issued extreme weather alerts as temperatures rise beyond 40 degrees
*14:53.200- 14:58.800* :  Celsius. North Macedonia has declared a state of emergency as it struggles to tackle more than
*14:58.800- 15:02.600* :  a dozen forest fires. Our Balkans correspondent, Guadalani reports.
*15:03.420- 15:08.160* :  North Macedonia is asking its neighbours to help as forest fires burn across the country.
*15:08.160- 15:13.360* :  Croatia is sending a firefighting plane, other countries are sending equipment and personnel.
*15:13.940- 15:18.840* :  Serbia is ready to send a firefighting helicopter to Bosnia, following a request from the country's
*15:18.840- 15:23.300* :  majority-served region, but Bosnia's foreign ministry is withholding its approval.
*15:23.820- 15:29.220* :  The extreme heat is triggering red alerts across the region. A higher 40 degrees is expected in
*15:29.220- 15:33.860* :  Serbia's capital, Belgrade. In neighbouring Croatia, the sea temperature is the issue.
*15:34.260- 15:38.900* :  The Adriatic off-Dubrovnik is now the warmest it's ever been, at almost 30 degrees.
*15:42.940- 15:48.100* :  Still to come on the Global News podcast, Gareth Southgate resigns as manager of the England
*15:48.100- 15:50.120* :  football team. We look at his legacy.
*15:58.420- 16:04.900* :  It's that time of the year. Your vacation is coming up. You can already hear the beach waves,

*16:40.460- 16:45.900* :  on former president Donald Trump. Republican and Democratic leadership have called for unity

*17:04.160- 17:09.060* :  The Indian authorities have given more details of a clash that saw five soldiers killed
*17:09.060- 17:14.700* :  in a gunfight with suspected militants in the Indian administered area of Jammu and Kashmir.
*17:15.300- 17:19.920* :  Militants reported to have ambushed troops carrying out a search operation amid thick forest
*17:19.920- 17:25.640* :  in the doda district of Jammu. I got more details from our South Asia correspondent, Yuga Telamai.
*17:26.420- 17:32.980* :  The Indian Army has just a short while ago released the names of its soldiers who died in that
*17:32.980- 17:39.080* :  operation. One of them is an officer of the level of captain. What the Army is saying is that
*17:39.080- 17:44.600* :  a gun battle started between militants and Indian security forces after a such operation was
*17:44.600- 17:50.500* :  launched by Indian forces in the doda area. That search operation they say was based on specific
*17:50.500- 17:56.920* :  intelligence inputs. The Defence Minister Rajnad Singh has put a post on social media platform X
*17:56.920- 18:03.540* :  saying that operations are still underway and they will continue until the threat is eliminated.
*18:04.060- 18:08.940* :  And tell us a bit about this area. So this is, you know, most of Kashmir is actually a very
*18:08.940- 18:14.580* :  mountainous region doda in particular. They're also very heavily wooded forest. So this is not an
*18:14.580- 18:21.800* :  easy battleground, which is why I suspect it is taking so much time for the threat in that area
*18:21.800- 18:27.940* :  to be eliminated. But we've also seen in this region an increasing number of attacks over the
*18:27.940- 18:32.600* :  recent weeks. And why is that happening? Military analysts who've been watching Kashmir for a long
*18:32.600- 18:38.460* :  time say that there seems to be a tactical shift as they call it and also a territorial shift in
*18:38.460- 18:43.840* :  terms of where militant operations are taking place in Kashmir region now. So in India this is
*18:43.840- 18:49.900* :  referred to as Jammu and Kashmir. And earlier most of the militant attacks would happen in the
*18:49.900- 18:55.240* :  Kashmir division, which is still the case. But the Jammu division, you know, was large. It didn't
*18:55.240- 19:00.120* :  see that many security incidents for, you know, almost two decades. And now you're suddenly seeing
*19:00.120- 19:04.880* :  a surge of them, you know, just over a week ago five soldiers were killed in an attack there.
*19:05.480- 19:09.400* :  What it does question is the claim made by the Indian government that the security
*19:09.400- 19:14.980* :  situation in Kashmir has improved since 2019 when they revoked the relative autonomy that the
*19:14.980- 19:19.980* :  region enjoyed. But we are seeing an increasing number of attacks, not just on security forces,
*19:19.980- 19:25.180* :  but also on tourists and pilgrims. It is a modern-wanced picture on the ground. What you aren't
*19:25.180- 19:30.240* :  seeing are street protests that used to happen in Kashmir, which often ended up in clashes
*19:30.780- 19:35.500* :  between civilians and security forces in which people were killed. So, you know, it's a
*19:35.500- 19:40.740* :  nuanced picture on the ground. Yoghater Lemay. If there's one way you can raise lots of money
*19:40.740- 19:45.840* :  for charity, it's by focusing on the plight of children. That's what Adam Wittington did. He's
*19:45.840- 19:51.500* :  a British former policeman who founded Project Rescue Children. People from around the world
*19:51.500- 19:56.620* :  contributed thousands of dollars to help its work. But the BBC has found that many of the stories
*19:56.620- 20:02.400* :  Mr Wittington told of children being saved were fake and that the cash he was given never
*20:02.400- 20:07.800* :  reached those it was meant for. Hilly Mortimer has this report. People just want to see rescues,
*20:07.840- 20:13.040* :  you know, and it's all glory and all this sort of, well that's great, but we do so much more.
*20:13.460- 20:19.740* :  Adam Wittington is a former London police officer. He now runs a charity Project Rescue Children
*20:19.740- 20:24.080* :  and posts updates of his work rescuing children from around the world.
*20:24.400- 20:32.320* :  I'll also confirm now everything I state is factual. He says PRC runs rescue centres in parts of
*20:32.320- 20:38.700* :  Africa where donors can support children through a sponsorship program. But the BBC has analysed
*20:38.700- 20:44.980* :  his social media accounts, uncovering false and misleading posts, including the rescue of a
*20:44.980- 20:50.680* :  newborn baby in the Gambia. It was probably one of our highlights for the year and it was just
*20:50.680- 20:55.900* :  really a needle in a haystack type of situation. It's here that Adam Wittington says that he
*20:55.900- 21:01.600* :  carried out the most unbelievable rescue mission. He says that his team received a tip-off that a
*21:01.600- 21:06.840* :  newborn baby was going to be handed over to traffickers at a busy marketplace in the Gambia.
*21:06.840- 21:13.320* :  He said he adopted the baby and asked one of his volunteers, a UK social media influencer,
*21:13.320- 21:18.100* :  to be the girl's mother and launched an international fundraising campaign.
*21:18.920- 21:24.620* :  Alex Betts visited the baby and the story went viral. The money came pouring in.
*21:28.760- 21:34.780* :  I just can't believe she's here. But the BBC has found this child and discovered that Adam's
*21:34.780- 21:40.280* :  rescue story was completely made up. She wasn't rescued from traffickers at a busy marketplace.
*21:40.300- 21:45.960* :  She was born right here and she's been living here with her mother ever since. She's never lived
*21:46.260- 21:50.900* :  in a rescue centre owned by project rescue children and none of the money that's been raised by
*21:50.900- 21:57.640* :  sponsors has been received by her mother. The mother tells us she's never received any money from
*21:57.640- 22:05.780* :  PRC but was given some groceries. Alex no longer works with PRC. She told us she's always acted with
*22:05.780- 22:13.240* :  honest and pure intentions. PRC insists that it did rescue a baby in collaboration with the Gambian
*22:13.240- 22:21.740* :  authorities. Deep in the countryside of West Kenya I meet a farmer called Joseph. PRC used a
*22:21.740- 22:28.280* :  photograph of his dead son to raise money through its child sponsorship program. PRC's website
*22:28.280- 22:33.720* :  said he'd been orphaned, trafficked or sexually exploited. None of this is true.
*22:35.640- 22:40.340* :  It pains my heart that someone is using the photos of my child to source for money that I
*22:40.340- 22:47.420* :  possibly did not even eat or taste. Not long after his photograph was taken, Eugene died.
*22:48.340- 22:54.600* :  But his picture remained online and according to PRC's website, people continued to send money
*22:54.600- 23:02.880* :  every month. Mama Jane and the rescue centre is really important to us and especially myself.
*23:03.300- 23:09.500* :  PRC has also made a series of false claims about rescue centres it funds in Kenya
*23:09.500- 23:16.800* :  and the Gambia. The BBC visited the properties and found no children. They're just family homes
*23:16.800- 23:23.060* :  that Adam Wittington used footage of to raise money. Project Rescue Children has been a registered
*23:23.060- 23:30.920* :  charity in Australia since 2017 but recently had its charity status revoked. PRC maintains that
*23:30.920- 23:37.280* :  the properties are rescue centres that care for children. It described our allegations as completely
*23:37.280- 23:43.800* :  without merit, misleading and defamatory. Haley Mortimer with that report and you can listen
*23:43.800- 23:48.360* :  to file on four as the child rescue con now, wherever you get your podcasts.
*23:49.880- 23:54.960* :  Rwanda's president Paul Kagame has been re-elected with the staggering 99% of the vote.
*23:54.960- 24:01.200* :  He faced no meaningful opposition with leading figures banned. Rites Groups accused Mr Kagame
*24:01.200- 24:06.800* :  of curtailing freedoms since taking office in the year 2000. His supporters say he's presided
*24:06.800- 24:13.300* :  over economic growth and helped end ethnic divisions after the Rwandan genocide. So what can we
*24:13.300- 24:18.860* :  expect this time? The BBC's Sambat Chusuzu is at the Rwandan capital Kagali.
*24:19.580- 24:25.780* :  President Kagame is going to rule over an important new post-generalisation. These include more
*24:25.780- 24:31.760* :  than two million people who voted yesterday and those we talked to yesterday they told us they
*24:31.760- 24:38.300* :  want jobs, they appraise him for good things as done, yes, but they say they want better from him.
*24:38.820- 24:44.640* :  And in his recent speech he has been trying to rally them behind him and he recently told them
*24:44.640- 24:51.660* :  that he wants the youth to be involved, to speak up. So we are talking about a Rwandan
*24:51.660- 24:58.200* :  generation that has internet, that has information and skills, but especially they are less traumatised
*24:58.820- 25:05.880* :  or not by the Rwandan genocide events than their parents that he has laid for more than two decades now.
*25:06.400- 25:10.760* :  So the first time for Kagame might be different from the last three we have seen
*25:11.340- 25:15.180* :  because he's going to be dealing with a different generation.
*25:15.680- 25:21.840* :  Sambat Chusuzu. A senior and North Korean diplomat based in Cuba has become the highest ranking
*25:21.840- 25:28.140* :  defector to flee to the South since 2019. The man, a counsellor responsible for political affairs,
*25:28.600- 25:32.260* :  is reported to have fled with his family from Pyongyang's embassy in Havana.
*25:33.000- 25:37.240* :  I raised a specific editor Celia Hatton to be more about the man and the background in his escape.
*25:38.060- 25:47.100* :  Re-Illgu was based, as you say, in a North Korea's embassy in Cuba and he had one job. He was meant to
*25:47.100- 25:53.660* :  prevent Cuba from forming ties, diplomatic ties with South Korea. That's North Korea's rival.
*25:53.660- 26:00.240* :  Well, he failed in this task. Cuba and South Korea announced they had formed a new special
*26:00.240- 26:07.420* :  relationship in February. That was just a few months before Mr. Rhee defected. He's now told
*26:07.420- 26:13.340* :  the South Korean newspaper that he was unhappy with how his work was evaluated. He was also
*26:13.340- 26:19.060* :  unhappy. He felt that he'd been judged for having a relatively low social background, which is
*26:19.060- 26:24.040* :  really important in North Korea. People are really ranked according to their family histories and
*26:24.040- 26:29.260* :  their family backgrounds. He didn't feel good about that. He said the final straw was when he'd
*26:29.260- 26:34.980* :  asked to go to Mexico for medical treatment and that request was denied. He abruptly made a decision.
*26:34.980- 26:39.720* :  He told his wife and daughter they were going to live overseas and that's when he defected.
*26:40.040- 26:45.580* :  He's in South Korea now and has been for some time and this is only emerging now, hasn't it?
*26:46.000- 26:51.860* :  Yeah, that's right. I mean, it seems that there's a lot of trepidation among South Korean officials
*26:51.860- 26:57.140* :  when North Koreans defect, especially high-ranking North Korean officials. Because South Koreans
*26:57.140- 27:03.000* :  are a little wary. They don't know if these North Koreans are working as double agents. So normally,
*27:03.000- 27:09.160* :  anyone who defects is subjected to a lot of questioning, but sometimes quite often, especially if
*27:09.160- 27:13.680* :  they're high-ranking officials, they have quite valuable information to offer as well. And so many
*27:13.680- 27:19.320* :  other high-ranking officials have gone on to work for the intelligence services in South Korea.
*27:38.620- 27:43.380* :  Of the man who said there's a proud Englishman, it's been the honor of his life to play for England
*27:43.900- 27:49.080* :  and also to manage them. It has meant everything to me and I've given it my all, but it's time for
*27:49.080- 27:55.820* :  a change and time for a new chapter. Southgate had been in charge for eight years also managed
*27:55.820- 28:03.180* :  102 games. He inherited a bit of a shambles to be honest back in 2016, but during his time in charge,
*28:03.820- 28:09.720* :  England have reached a World Cup semi-final and two European championship finals. Of course,
*28:09.720- 28:14.680* :  they lost both of those, including the game against Spain on Sunday. And now he will look for
*28:14.680- 28:19.540* :  a fresh challenge and the England national football team may be heading in the new direction.
*28:20.000- 28:26.420* :  But he's moved beyond football, hasn't he? He's become part of English culture and actually detoxified
*28:26.420- 28:33.220* :  it, hasn't he? He has and I think in many ways that's his biggest success because I was talking to
*28:33.220- 28:37.640* :  Gareth Southgate during a previous role over many years and every single press conference,
*28:37.640- 28:44.160* :  every single interview he would do. He will be asked about a major issue whether it was COVID-19
*28:44.160- 28:49.600* :  or what was going on in the government and he would be expected to give an opinion and he would
*28:49.600- 28:56.220* :  always give an opinion. He would always be interesting and helpful and often have a point of view
*28:56.220- 29:02.940* :  which would maybe set the tone for the nation and considering the difficult times that England and
*29:02.940- 29:08.220* :  the United Kingdom as a wider area have had over the last eight years. Gareth Southgate has
*29:08.220- 29:13.900* :  been a beacon of stability and I think in terms of the football pitch, England have benefited from
*29:13.900- 29:19.140* :  that. Do you think history will be kind to him? I think it will be. I think a lot of people have said
*29:19.140- 29:24.780* :  he had the best squad available to him for these European championships. He didn't win it,
*29:24.780- 29:29.920* :  losing to Spain in the final and that maybe regarded as something of a failure. But when you look
*29:29.920- 29:35.020* :  at what previous England coaches have achieved since England won the World Cup, they're only
*29:35.020- 29:41.940* :  major honour in 1966. I think history will judge him very kindly and in years to come people may be
*29:41.940- 29:46.880* :  looking to emulate Gareth Southgate rather than considering him someone who underachieved.
*29:47.160- 29:53.820* :  Who's going to replace him then Nigel? It's an interesting question. Graham Potter and also the
*29:53.820- 29:59.320* :  Newcastle coach Eddie Howe are being talked about as potential English successors but it's
*29:59.320- 30:04.880* :  understood the Football Association won't be looking at just English coaches and there's even
*30:04.880- 30:10.500* :  been talk of Jürgen Klopp, the former Liverpool manager or Thomas Tukall, the German coach taking
*30:10.500- 30:16.840* :  over but it's a very big job and it's a very hard act to follow. Nigel Adely on the outgoing England
*30:16.840- 30:22.940* :  manager, Gareth Southgate. And that's it from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the
