*01:33.260- 01:38.600* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 24th of July.
*01:38.600- 01:44.620* :  An inquiry in New Zealand finds nearly a third of people in care were abused over the past 70 years.
*01:45.480- 01:51.800* :  Taiwan is hit by typhoon gemmy and a plane has crashed in the pool only the pilot survived.
*01:54.740- 02:00.100* :  Also in the podcast, as Benjamin Netanyahu visits the US, the mother of a hostage calls on the
*02:00.100- 02:06.120* :  Israeli Prime Minister to do a deal to free the captives in Gaza. I'm not losing hope at any point
*02:06.140- 02:13.640* :  but these are critical moments. I'm asking and hoping that our Prime Minister's commitment to this.
*02:14.700- 02:21.120* :  Will be his first priority. And how the leg of a surfer washed up on a beach after a shark attack.
*02:25.780- 02:31.660* :  But first to a shocking statistic from New Zealand, nearly a third of people in care over the past
*02:31.660- 02:38.520* :  seven decades were abused. A public inquiry found that 200,000 children, young people and
*02:38.520- 02:44.260* :  vulnerable adults had experienced some form of abuse in state and faith-based institutions
*02:44.300- 02:50.440* :  from 1950 onwards with the indigenous Maori community particularly badly affected.
*02:51.000- 02:56.360* :  The victim suffered rape, sterilization and electric shocks. Here are some of the survivors who
*02:56.360- 03:05.040* :  came forward. I didn't remember my abuse until I was an adult and started getting flashbacks.
*03:05.660- 03:13.800* :  And that was very traumatic. Just the trauma of the memories of abuse, they live with you all the time.
*03:14.160- 03:19.720* :  It's the start of healing with everything that's happened over the last six years and hopefully
*03:19.720- 03:24.080* :  the government will listen and change and it's just the start of the journey for many.
*03:24.080- 03:29.340* :  For decades they told us we made it up. So this today is historic and acknowledged.
*03:29.340- 03:33.960* :  All the survivors that have been courageous and strong enough to share their stories and come on board.
*03:34.540- 03:38.500* :  The New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon apologised on behalf of the state.
*03:39.240- 03:44.540* :  Thank you for your exceptional strength, your incredible courage and also your confronting honesty.
*03:45.520- 03:51.080* :  I cannot take away your pain but I can tell you this. Today you are heard and you are believed.
*03:51.100- 03:56.880* :  The state was supposed to care for you to protect you but instead it subjected you to unimaginable
*03:56.880- 04:03.600* :  physical, emotional, mental and sexual abuse. This is a dark and sorrowful day in New Zealand's history.
*04:04.380- 04:07.660* :  I heard more about the scandal from our correspondent Katie Watson.
*04:08.200- 04:14.300* :  There was 655,000 people in state and faith-based care between 1950 and 2019.
*04:14.380- 04:18.640* :  200,000 of those abused even more were neglected.
*04:19.300- 04:26.360* :  2,300 survivors came forward and the abuse as you've mentioned that was rape, that was sterilisation.
*04:26.880- 04:32.280* :  Electric shock, there was also people who were denied basic necessities such as privacy,
*04:32.280- 04:39.420* :  clothing and food. So there was a whole catalogue of abuses that has taken six years at Royal
*04:39.420- 04:44.620* :  Commission. It's the highest level of inquiry in New Zealand and of course these dreadful,
*04:44.620- 04:50.260* :  dreadful findings. The report says the indigenous community suffered more than most.
*04:50.260- 04:54.420* :  Did it explain why? That's right. It singled out that the indigenous
*04:54.420- 05:02.080* :  Maori community also were, they faced racism, also cultural neglect. Many were unable to speak
*05:02.080- 05:07.940* :  their own language. Certainly there was a dominance of those who were disabled who were also
*05:07.940- 05:13.680* :  singled out in the report. I mean this was a huge amount of abuse among the population of those
*05:13.680- 05:18.320* :  who were in care, the children, young people, vulnerable adults but certainly the indigenous
*05:18.320- 05:25.720* :  Maori community were particularly at risk. The report covers the period 1950 to 2019 until relatively
*05:25.720- 05:33.320* :  recently. It also says the abuse peaked in the 70s so have things now changed? Well, things like
*05:33.320- 05:37.760* :  electric shock, hopefully that was something that really peaked in the 1970s. I mean this report
*05:37.760- 05:44.740* :  looked at up until 2019 so really recently but of course we've heard from the Prime Minister saying
*05:44.740- 05:49.060* :  that this now needs to be taken seriously and obviously that he has apologised is going to be
*05:49.060- 05:56.100* :  a formal apology in November. There are also a huge amount of recommendations. 138 recommendations
*05:56.100- 06:01.800* :  at the report has asked for. So that's what we're going to see and these include compensation.
*06:01.940- 06:06.340* :  The government's already acknowledged that the compensation could be billions of dollars
*06:06.740- 06:10.780* :  and it's also asked for public apologies not just from the government but also from
*06:11.020- 06:15.340* :  different religious organisations. So the Pope and the Catholic Church, the Archbishop of
*06:15.340- 06:20.300* :  Canterbury and the Anglican Church, this is a wide-ranging inquiry that's pinpointed a lot of
*06:20.300- 06:24.500* :  problems right at the top of organisations and it's asking for those apologies. You mentioned
*06:24.500- 06:29.460* :  compensation but might there be prosecutions? Well, I mean the Prime Minister said that they're
*06:29.460- 06:33.920* :  going to be talking to survivors groups and obviously taking the next steps and compensation
*06:33.920- 06:39.960* :  is obviously one of the biggest issues for the survivors. So this is going to open up a huge
*06:39.960- 06:46.820* :  amount of reflection of legal processes and of course a huge amount of pain to go through
*06:46.820- 06:51.980* :  in those apologies. So in the next few months and years of course will be a very difficult time
*06:51.980- 06:58.100* :  for New Zealand. Katie Watson talking to me from Sydney. As we record this podcast, Taiwan has
*06:58.100- 07:03.580* :  been hit by its strongest typhoon in nearly a decade. The storm made landfall on the northeast of
*07:03.580- 07:08.960* :  the island bringing heavy rain and high winds. Forecasters say central areas of Taiwan could have
*07:08.960- 07:14.840* :  more than a meter of rain before the typhoon arrived these fishermen in the northeast secured their
*07:14.840- 07:25.160* :  boats. I'm very nervous. No typhoon has landed here in the past eight years so I quickly came
*07:25.160- 07:34.020* :  to tie up my boat. I'm very worried. I came over to the boat because the tide had moved it.
*07:34.020- 07:41.000* :  I need to tie it up again. Shortly before we've recorded the podcast, we got an update from
*07:41.000- 07:46.880* :  Rupert Wingfield Hayes in the Taiwanese capital. We understand the typhoon has now come ashore on
*07:46.880- 07:51.940* :  the east coast, the northeast coast of Taiwan, about 50 miles away from where I'm standing. So
*07:52.340- 07:58.040* :  over there, over the mountains behind me here, they are already experiencing very destructive winds.
*07:58.040- 08:03.100* :  I've seen some recent video taken in the last hour with gusts that look like they're well over
*08:03.100- 08:07.780* :  100 miles an hour in the streets of Elan, which is a city over the other side of the mountains
*08:07.800- 08:14.880* :  on the east coast. There have already been reports of lots of trees being brought down by the
*08:14.880- 08:19.980* :  strong winds and indeed we have now got the first report of one death of someone who was riding
*08:19.980- 08:28.400* :  their motorcycle and very sadly a tree came down and hit them and killed them. So clearly it is
*08:28.400- 08:34.460* :  very dangerous to be outside along the east coast of Taiwan already this afternoon. The storm is
*08:34.460- 08:39.120* :  going to move across the island later today and into tonight and indeed it's expected to come
*08:39.120- 08:44.240* :  right over the top of the capital here in Taipei. You can see the conditions here. It's raining
*08:44.240- 08:48.700* :  heavily. We're getting gusts of winds but this is expected to get a lot stronger in the next few
*08:48.700- 08:55.700* :  hours. Rupert Wingfield Hayes in Taiwan. A plane has crashed on takeoff at Kathmandu International
*09:05.160- 09:10.100* :  Airport in Nepal. footage from the scene showed wreckage on fire in a grassy area below the runway
*09:10.100- 09:16.640* :  while black smoke pours into the air. Police say 18 people on board died with only the pilot
*09:16.640- 09:25.140* :  surviving. Ram Kumar witnessed the crash. I was inside a shop when the plane accident occurred.
*09:25.620- 09:30.140* :  There was a very loud noise. It sounded like maybe a truck had overturned on the road.
*09:30.900- 09:36.540* :  We ran off to we saw the crash. The plane then hit the ground and caught fire. We were about to
*09:36.540- 09:43.220* :  run to the site but then there was an explosion. So we ran away again. Nepal has a reputation as one
*09:43.220- 09:47.600* :  of the most dangerous places in the world for air travel thanks to its mountainous terrain
*09:47.600- 09:53.660* :  and the use of small planes to reach remote areas. I got an update from Sanjay Adakal from the
*09:53.660- 09:59.020* :  BBC in a poly service in Kathmandu. This morning at the local time, 11 minutes past 11
*09:59.020- 10:05.040* :  and airlines carrying 19 people crashed immediately after takeoff from the airport in Kathmandu.
*10:05.520- 10:10.720* :  18 bodies have been recovered so far according to the Civil Aviation Authority and the captain
*10:10.720- 10:16.300* :  was rescued and has been taken to hospital. Do we know about what happened? Did the plane actually
*10:16.300- 10:23.400* :  get off the runway before crashing? According to the officials of the Saudi airlines, it is
*10:23.400- 10:31.040* :  a private airline that operates in the domestic sector of Nepal. It was doing an annual maintenance
*10:31.040- 10:37.580* :  check mission and was carrying its staffs and technicians and immediately after takeoff it crashed.
*10:37.580- 10:43.520* :  It was headed towards Pokhara but the accident happened minutes after the takeoff in Kathmandu
*10:43.520- 10:49.720* :  airport. It crashed just near the airport. And this is just the latest in a series of aviation
*10:49.760- 10:55.640* :  accidents that has affected Nepal over the years. That is correct. This is the fourth
*10:55.640- 11:02.920* :  fatal accident in last five years in Kathmandu in Nepal. And if you talk about past accidents,
*11:02.920- 11:09.120* :  Nepal has been quite prone to air accidents and since 1946, there have been nearly 70 accidents and
*11:09.120- 11:16.560* :  that has led to nearly 900 deaths. The BBC is Sanjay Adakal in Kathmandu. The Israeli Prime Minister
*11:16.560- 11:21.340* :  Benjamin Netanyahu is due to be given the rare honor of addressing a joint session of the
*11:21.340- 11:27.220* :  U.S. Congress in Washington in the next few hours. But back home in Israel, he remains under enormous
*11:27.220- 11:33.240* :  pressure from the relatives of hostages still being held in Gaza. They urged him not to travel until
*11:33.240- 11:38.660* :  he'd sealed a deal with Hamas for the captive's release last week, some of the families published
*11:38.660- 11:45.800* :  photos of their loved ones before and during their ordeal. Ayelet Levy Shaka is desperate to bring
*11:45.800- 11:50.060* :  her 20-year-old daughter Nama home. She spoke to Barbara Pletasha.
*11:51.120- 11:57.420* :  She's a girl of values, the peace-seeker, and she's a good sister to her siblings.
*11:57.660- 12:03.440* :  She's a good daughter, although she likes to fight with her mom, which just means that she's very
*12:03.440- 12:09.200* :  normal. I think she's very strong. Your face lights up when you talk about her. I miss her very
*12:09.200- 12:15.980* :  much and I worry. But when I talk about her, it's like she's here with me and of course I love her.
*12:16.820- 12:21.220* :  Tell me about releasing the photos now of her and some of the other young women who are in captivity.
*12:21.660- 12:28.160* :  This is a part of the frames from a film that was taken by the Hamas somewhere in the very
*12:28.160- 12:34.220* :  beginning after the kidnapping. He decided to publish it and to show this to the world, especially
*12:34.220- 12:42.360* :  in this very critical moment of negotiation. This is the most important point that we have
*12:42.360- 12:50.840* :  arrived at for closing a deal in order to save them. So are you hopeful then? Yes. I'm not losing
*12:50.840- 12:56.060* :  hope at any point, but these are critical moments. The Prime Minister is going to the United States
*12:57.020- 13:02.400* :  and asked if you'd come along on his plane and you said you would not accompany the Prime Minister
*13:02.400- 13:11.180* :  on his plane. Why is that? I just feel that the focus right now is on the talks and on the
*13:11.180- 13:18.880* :  negotiations and on getting this deal sealed and bringing our hostages back home. I just think
*13:18.880- 13:23.100* :  this is not the right time for this. You think it might lead to a delay on this issue? It might
*13:23.100- 13:29.200* :  lead to a delay. It might lead to a distraction. I'm asking and hoping that our Prime Minister's
*13:29.200- 13:35.260* :  commitment to this will be his first priority. How important do you think the U.S. role is?
*13:35.420- 13:40.880* :  I think that the U.S. plays a critical role in the negotiations. They're reaching the point
*13:40.940- 13:49.340* :  of breaking a deal. The both sides are coming closer with their demands and you know even saying
*13:49.340- 13:56.680* :  that it sounds wrong to me because how can you be talking about demands when you're talking about
*13:56.680- 14:05.380* :  my daughter's life? We are over nine months. So I'm actually feeling desperate. It has to happen.
*14:05.380- 14:11.140* :  It has to happen. I yell at Levy Schacher talking to Barbara Plattasha.
*14:12.120- 14:16.260* :  The authorities in Australia have praised the efforts of an off-duty policeman who's quick
*14:16.260- 14:21.640* :  thinking might have saved the life of a surfer and possibly his leg after a shark attack.
*14:21.660- 14:27.560* :  The 23-year-old man is in a serious but stable condition in hospital. His leg was severed while
*14:27.560- 14:31.580* :  he was surfing on Australia's east coast. Sean Wales has the story.
*14:32.500- 14:39.340* :  Kai McKenzie was surfing at Port Macquarie 400 km north of Sydney. When on Tuesday he was
*14:39.340- 14:45.500* :  brutally attacked by a great white shark. He managed to catch a wave to shore but his leg had been
*14:45.500- 14:51.380* :  completely severed. Thankfully for the surfer an off-duty policeman was walking his dog on the
*14:51.380- 14:57.160* :  beach at the time. He used the dog's lead to form a tourniquet, stemming the bleeding from
*14:57.160- 15:03.280* :  Kai McKenzie's leg before he was taken to hospital. As for the severed part of the surfer's leg,
*15:03.280- 15:08.980* :  it has now been retrieved after washing up on the beach and has also been taken to hospital
*15:09.480- 15:14.920* :  where doctors are assessing whether it might be possible to reattach it. A fundraiser to support
*15:14.920- 15:22.080* :  his recovery has already raised $60,000 US dollars. The sponsored surfer had only recently returned
*15:22.080- 15:27.220* :  to the ocean. He posted on social media that he had fractured his neck earlier in the year.
*15:27.840- 15:33.580* :  Four people were killed by sharks in Australia last year. The majority of shark attack incidents
*15:33.580- 15:42.020* :  occur in remote or regional areas. Sean Wales. And still to come on the global news podcast.

*17:27.380- 17:32.700* :  landslides killed more than 200 people. Prime Minister Abbi Ahmed said the team would help
*17:32.700- 17:37.640* :  coordinate operations there. The government plans to evacuate people living in the surrounding
*17:37.640- 17:43.660* :  area due to the risk of more landslides. Paul Hanley is the UN humanitarian coordinator for
*17:43.660- 17:50.380* :  Ethiopia. So look I mean on Sunday there was a first landslide that affected its district of
*17:50.380- 17:55.500* :  Gopher district in southern Ethiopia bearing a number of houses and including three families
*17:56.080- 18:01.960* :  and then on Monday as rescue efforts were underway and even bigger landslide buried a far greater
*18:01.960- 18:08.240* :  area. The death toll as it stands is around 229. A number of people have been rescued and there's
*18:08.240- 18:13.560* :  at least 12 people injured in hospital. The government and partners have dispatched a number of
*18:13.560- 18:19.620* :  relief items and further teams to conduct more assessments today that includes assistance in
*18:19.620- 18:24.260* :  terms of food and medical items and water and sanitation. The government's also establishing an
*18:24.260- 18:29.560* :  incident command post under the Ethiopian disaster risk management commission which we're embedding
*18:29.560- 18:35.300* :  stuff to assist with. I spoke a short while ago with one of my colleagues on the ground who was
*18:35.300- 18:40.140* :  telling me one of the biggest concerns now is for a further more than 10,000 people who live in these
*18:40.140- 18:46.460* :  two communities that have been affected by this landslide. You need to move off the area there
*18:46.460- 18:50.400* :  as for concerns still about the stability of the slope as the rains are continuing.
*18:51.160- 18:57.820* :  Let's look at the more than 10,000 people who you said need to be moved. Is there a sense of where
*18:57.820- 19:03.380* :  they could be moved to? So we're working together with the local authorities and that to ensure that
*19:03.540- 19:07.820* :  they can be out of harm's way and provided with the assistance they need. We're also trying to
*19:07.820- 19:12.820* :  support the government with international expertise to look at the stability of the slope and
*19:12.820- 19:17.660* :  to make sure that people are not going back prematurely. I think the other thing to say though is
*19:17.660- 19:23.880* :  that Ethiopia is a country that's regularly affected by extremes of the weather. I mean already
*19:23.880- 19:30.400* :  this year we're responding to a drought emergency as well as the impacts of conflict where we're
*19:30.400- 19:35.300* :  trying to assist 15 million people together with the government for a drought that was driven by
*19:35.300- 19:40.680* :  the El Nino effect last year trying to we've been trying to mobilize over three billion dollars
*19:40.680- 19:47.060* :  the response that's woefully underfunded and now with the extremes of rain coming we also
*19:47.060- 19:52.560* :  seem more of the expect more of these kind of emergencies to continue. How are the recovery efforts
*19:52.560- 19:59.260* :  coming along? So the government has deployed teams I think they're sadly with landslides it's
*19:59.260- 20:04.440* :  uncommon to find large numbers of people alive unlike in in an earthquake situation. The first
*20:04.440- 20:09.080* :  responders were of course the local community and the local authorities and this is a remote area
*20:09.080- 20:14.680* :  in an in a mountainous part of of southern Ethiopia. So also getting heavy earth moving equipment
*20:14.680- 20:18.600* :  into the area has been quite a challenge particularly given the condition of the roads. Paul
*20:18.600- 20:23.880* :  Handley, UN humanitarian coordinator for Ethiopia talking to Victoria Oonkunda.
*20:24.940- 20:30.480* :  A choice between fear and hate that is the argument commoner Harris is making as she appeals for
*20:30.480- 20:35.500* :  Americans to vote for her in November's presidential election. She addressed supporters in the
*20:35.500- 20:41.220* :  battleground state of Wisconsin on her first official rally since becoming the de facto democratic
*20:41.220- 20:48.440* :  candidate. Just look at how we are running our campaigns. So Donald Trump is relying on
*20:48.440- 20:57.720* :  support from billionaires and big corporations. On the other hand we are running a people-powered
*21:06.900- 21:13.920* :  campaign. And we just had some breaking news we just had the best 24 hours.
*21:20.340- 21:26.700* :  A grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history.
*21:28.940- 21:35.440* :  Well in its most recent update the Harris campaign said it had raised $126 million so far.
*21:35.440- 21:41.100* :  Donations are important to both the democratic and republican parties and a lot of time and effort
*21:41.100- 21:46.480* :  goes into fundraising as well as wooing big business and industry figures to boost funding.
*21:47.160- 21:51.940* :  That is a professor of political science at the University of California. He has been talking
*21:51.940- 21:56.680* :  to our business reporter Sean Farrington. Well what we have seen in the past 24 hours with
*21:56.680- 22:02.220* :  Kamala Harris has record breaking call that was fueled by donations from 880,000
*22:02.220- 22:07.980* :  individual Americans. Nearly a million people have given to this campaign. That is different
*22:07.980- 22:11.920* :  from both where Donald Trump has been raising his money but also different from where the Biden
*22:11.920- 22:18.180* :  Harris campaign raised their money so far. So each campaign has raised half a billion dollars if
*22:18.180- 22:23.180* :  you include both the direct contributions that they have gotten and the outside money going through
*22:23.180- 22:28.260* :  groups with what we call super PACs. And those have really relied on big donors. Big businesses
*22:28.260- 22:33.080* :  large billionaires like Donald Trump's number one donors but also major venture capital firms
*22:33.080- 22:37.000* :  who are two of the three biggest donors to what was then the Biden Harris campaign.
*22:38.100- 22:42.840* :  What Kamala Harris really bragged about in the last couple days has been her shift towards a
*22:43.200- 22:48.820* :  smaller set of a set of grassroots donors giving smaller amounts but much more active,
*22:48.820- 22:54.620* :  much larger number of people. And do you think will the donation donor picture change at all
*22:55.040- 22:59.760* :  for the republican party now and for Donald Trump? Now that it's looking like it's going to
*22:59.760- 23:05.900* :  be Kamala Harris that he's up against. Well Donald Trump has been an incredible fundraiser
*23:05.900- 23:12.240* :  this year. Go Biden came into the campaign with a big edge in money, right? As incumbents often do
*23:12.240- 23:17.820* :  but as Donald Trump's campaign took fire, he used everything that drove his campaign,
*23:17.820- 23:23.640* :  all of the court appearances, his convictions even. He used those as fundraising opportunities
*23:23.640- 23:29.620* :  and was able to raise, I believe, 130 million dollars in the last quarter. So he's really caught
*23:29.620- 23:34.860* :  up and actually now has a slight lead on Kamala Harris and a lot of that is because he's been using
*23:34.860- 23:40.300* :  the attention that he captures constantly in American politics to also galvanize a large set of
*23:40.300- 23:46.280* :  small donors. Third, Councillor, Professor of Political Science. King Charles has never hidden his
*23:46.280- 23:51.520* :  passion for the environment as heir to the throne he was well known for campaigning on green issues.
*23:52.140- 23:57.120* :  Now he is the British monarch, he seems determined to make the royal operations a bit more eco-friendly
*23:57.120- 24:02.020* :  with a number of initiatives revealed in the Crown's latest financial report as I heard from
*24:02.020- 24:08.400* :  Art Royal correspondent Johnny Diamond. It's important to note this is part of a long process
*24:08.400- 24:14.500* :  because not just the current king when he was Prince of Wales but also the late Queen's
*24:14.880- 24:21.780* :  husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, have both for decades been going on about greenery,
*24:21.780- 24:28.380* :  environmentalism, waste, consumption, etc, etc. And so the stuff that we got this year, which is,
*24:28.540- 24:34.100* :  you know, it's nibbling at the edges. It's about sort of putting cars with sustainable fuel
*24:34.100- 24:40.060* :  and putting some solar panels up and stuff like that. It really is part of a piece. It is just
*24:40.060- 24:48.120* :  notable and it marks up the fact that environmentalism probably has its most senior and active defender
*24:48.120- 24:52.340* :  in its most influential position, being the king not just of the United Kingdom but one another
*24:52.340- 24:58.360* :  14 or so realms. And every time there is an announcement like this, you are reminded of the king's
*24:58.360- 25:03.460* :  position and his beliefs. I did those see one suggestion that the Royal House odds going to get
*25:03.460- 25:08.700* :  two new helicopters. Is there a contradiction there? Is that just the way they need to get around?
*25:09.020- 25:15.180* :  Look, some people will see a contradiction in their energy-intense lifestyle. Let's not
*25:15.180- 25:20.320* :  beat about the Bush helicopters, chartering planes, the train of their own. You know, all of that
*25:20.320- 25:26.320* :  stuff that they would argue enables them to do the job they do, which is relatively active and
*25:26.320- 25:33.380* :  mobile head of state or head of states and any pledge towards environmentalism. Some people will
*25:33.380- 25:39.260* :  see a complete contradiction in those two positions. Other people feel that it's fairly easy to
*25:39.260- 25:44.220* :  justify if you're going to go and spread the word and do the job you do. So clearly the compromise
*25:44.220- 25:50.920* :  for the king has been, I will continue broadly speaking in the manner to which I am accustomed,
*25:50.920- 25:57.600* :  but I'll do everything I can to make sure that in every action, the household, the palace,
*25:57.600- 26:02.700* :  the crown carries out, it's as green as possible. So those two new helicopters, yes, they replace
*26:02.700- 26:06.860* :  two old helicopters, which makes them, I guess, more efficient, but they're also able to take a lot
*26:06.860- 26:12.980* :  more sustainable aviation fuel. You know, this stuff is thought about and has been thought about
*26:12.980- 26:17.860* :  hard by both the king and the people around him now for decades. Our royal correspondent,
*26:17.860- 26:23.920* :  Johnny Diamond. Janet Jackson, the youngest of the most successful family in show business,
*26:24.420- 26:30.140* :  has revealed she abandoned dance classes as a child and became self-taught after abuse from
*26:30.140- 26:35.220* :  teachers. The singer is in the middle of a world tour celebrating her career spanning five decades.
*26:35.220- 26:38.280* :  She's been talking to our music correspondent, Mark Savage.
*26:40.920- 26:46.900* :  I started when I was seven. I don't ever remember being asked. I just remember doing it.
*26:48.460- 26:54.360* :  She is the youngest child of the Jackson family, but Janet never intended to become a musician.
*26:54.780- 26:58.980* :  In fact, she told her father that she wanted to be a horse racing jockey or a lawyer,
*26:59.240- 27:03.380* :  but after turning Michael into a megastar, Joe Jackson had other ideas.
*27:03.860- 27:08.620* :  We had a studio at home growing up, and I rid my first song when I was nine years old.
*27:08.800- 27:09.400* :  Can you sing it?
*27:16.940- 27:24.820* :  like that. And I played everything on it, and I sang on it. Left the tape, and went to school
*27:24.820- 27:31.240* :  the next morning, came home from school, and I hear the song that I had just put down being played.
*27:31.240- 27:36.720* :  I was so embarrassed and then my father said you're going to say and I said no
*27:36.720- 27:43.940* :  No, I want to go to college and study business line. He said no, and when your dad decided something you couldn't deny and write
*27:43.940- 27:48.100* :  It was kind of hard because he I mean look at where he let my brothers
*27:48.180- 27:52.840* :  When I was 17, I'd give the people told me
*27:56.540- 28:00.640* :  It was my father said and let my mother move me
*28:01.100- 28:07.400* :  By the age of 18, Janet was making music on her own and rivaling her brother Michael as one of pop's best dancers
*28:07.960- 28:10.460* :  And surprisingly, she was entirely self-taught
*28:10.760- 28:19.980* :  Mother tried when I was very little putting me in ballet and my teacher she hit me. I was young. I was little maybe four, five
*28:21.360- 28:27.400* :  So mother took me out years later when I was 14 she put me into a private class
*28:28.520- 28:33.820* :  And my instructor got a little too close to me and I felt very uncomfortable
*28:34.620- 28:36.240* :  So I never really studied
*28:37.100- 28:37.640* :  I'm listening
*28:38.180- 28:42.600* :  Shy and reserved as a child, her confidence grew when she hit the recording studio
*28:43.620- 28:48.420* :  You've come up with a line that stuck with you through your whole career. My first name ain't baby
*28:49.200- 28:49.720* :  It's Janet
*28:55.360- 29:01.660* :  These guys started harassing my friend and I and I was really really bothered and really upset
*29:01.660- 29:03.820* :  So that's how the whole song nasty came about
*29:04.260- 29:09.020* :  It was your response to them. Yeah, and I think it's a difficult thing in this industry to be
*29:09.660- 29:11.740* :  particularly in the 80s and assertive women
*29:12.360- 29:14.500* :  What were the barriers you came up against? Oh God
*29:15.280- 29:20.960* :  In the industry, more so than anything being told no, you're a girl. You can't do that girls don't do that
*29:21.680- 29:27.580* :  More than once. What sort of thing? One of the songs that they were hesitant about was together again
*29:27.960- 29:33.040* :  Why so? I think it was because of the era of AIDS and all that was surrounding it
*29:33.800- 29:41.360* :  But yeah, I had lost a lot of friends and a lot of people that I knew to it and I wanted to write it was heavily on my mind
*29:47.300- 29:53.920* :  And she's written other songs about political and social issues covering everything from racism and poverty to school shootings
*29:55.120- 29:58.900* :  Looking back now, are you discouraged that we're still talking about the same issues?
*29:59.280- 30:03.840* :  It's crazy isn't it? It's sad just thinking about a lyric in screen
*30:04.720- 30:07.620* :  Oh my god, can't believe what I saw. Has that turned on the TV?
*30:11.540- 30:14.680* :  Have we made some strides? Yeah, I think we definitely have
*30:15.800- 30:18.040* :  But there's still so much further to go
*30:22.520- 30:27.860* :  That message is woven into her current tour and Janet Hope's fans leave the shows inspired
*30:28.380- 30:34.420* :  Even if you made a difference in one person's life, that's success
*30:37.020- 30:39.080* :  And Janet Jackson was talking to Mark Savage
