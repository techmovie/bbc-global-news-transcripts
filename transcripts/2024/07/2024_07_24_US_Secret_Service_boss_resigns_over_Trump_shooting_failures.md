*01:31.660- 01:35.080* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:38.620- 01:44.300* :  I'm Bernard Ekio, and in the early hours of Wednesday the 24th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:45.160- 01:50.540* :  The director of the US Secret Service has resigned after facing sharp criticism for her
*01:50.540- 01:54.360* :  agency's failure to prevent the assassination attempt on Donald Trump.
*01:55.260- 02:00.260* :  Kamala Harris has promised to bring the fight to Donald Trump in her first rally since becoming
*02:00.260- 02:06.300* :  the Democrat's presumptive nominee for president. A major rescue operation is underway in the
*02:06.300- 02:11.920* :  remote South Atlantic, after almost 30 people aboard a fishing vessel had to abandon their sinking
*02:11.980- 02:20.300* :  ship. Also in this podcast, this is the first time that actually cocaine has been
*02:20.300- 02:26.080* :  detected in the muscle of sharks. We've detected it in other animals before, but this is at a higher
*02:26.080- 02:31.980* :  concentration than you see in other animals. Sharks off the coast of Brazil test positive for cocaine.
*02:37.820- 02:43.280* :  We begin in Washington where Kimberley Cheatle has caved into intense pressure and resigned as
*02:43.280- 02:49.000* :  director of the US Secret Service after admitting to a colossal failure for not preventing the
*02:49.000- 02:54.440* :  attempted assassination of Donald Trump 10 days ago. On Monday, she failed to give lawmakers
*02:54.440- 02:58.960* :  at a congressional hearing the answers they wanted during fiery exchanges.
*02:59.760- 03:04.640* :  Ms Cheatle even appeared determined to stay in post when she was questioned by the Democrat
*03:04.640- 03:10.640* :  congressman, Rokana. Would you agree that this is the most serious security lapse since President
*03:10.640- 03:15.040* :  Reagan was shot in 1981 of the Secret Service? Yes, sir, I would.
*03:15.500- 03:21.820* :  And, you know, do you know what Stuart Knight did when he was in charge at the time of the Secret
*03:21.820- 03:28.020* :  Service? Do you know what he did? Afterwards? He remained undue. He resigned. He resigned.
*03:28.940- 03:34.060* :  But her fate was sealed after this appearance. The Republican Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson,
*03:34.060- 03:39.920* :  was announcing a task force made up of Democrats and Republicans to investigate the shooting of Mr. Trump
*03:39.920- 03:44.960* :  when he learned about Ms Cheatle's decision. The immediate reaction to her resignation is that it
*03:44.960- 03:49.620* :  is overdue. She should have done this at least a week ago. I'm happy to see that.
*03:50.280- 03:55.080* :  Now we have to pick up the pieces. We have to rebuild the American people's faith and trust
*03:55.080- 04:00.300* :  in the Secret Service as an agency. It has an incredibly important responsibility in protecting
*04:00.300- 04:06.000* :  presidents, former presidents, and other officials. For more on why Kimberley Cheatle decided to
*04:06.000- 04:11.980* :  step down, I spoke to our Washington correspondent, Nomiya Ekbal. In the hearing, she was very
*04:11.980- 04:16.720* :  adamant that she wouldn't stand down. She was very adamant that she was the best person for the
*04:16.720- 04:21.860* :  job, but clearly the pressure has become too much. And she sent out this letter this morning saying
*04:21.860- 04:27.840* :  that it was with a heavy heart that she now resigns. She's been in the job for less than two years,
*04:28.200- 04:31.980* :  and one of only two women to ever serve as the Head of the Secret Service. But I think it was
*04:31.980- 04:37.120* :  quite clear that her position was untenable. Well, as you say, Monday was a bruising day for her.
*04:37.480- 04:43.300* :  Did her evidence and her responses seal her fate? I think so. There were crucial questions to be
*04:43.300- 04:49.900* :  answered. One of them was why weren't there Secret Service agents on the rooftop? And especially
*04:49.900- 04:56.600* :  considering the gunman was already highlighted to the Secret Service. And Kimberley Cheatle said
*04:56.620- 05:04.500* :  that, that the FBI had warned the Secret Service that he had been flying a drone above the rally
*05:04.500- 05:11.680* :  beforehand. And so why weren't precautions taken? And Ms Cheatle gave a very bizarre response
*05:11.680- 05:16.800* :  to the question of why weren't there Secret Service agents on the rooftop. She said that they
*05:16.800- 05:22.880* :  preferred sterile routes. And previously, she had said that they don't like sloping routes,
*05:22.880- 05:27.760* :  which she apologized for, but by sterile, it was very confusing as to what she meant. Does she
*05:27.760- 05:33.860* :  mean flat routes? We weren't quite sure. And that really exacerbated the anger that was already
*05:33.860- 05:39.260* :  in that hearing amongst the lawmakers and one lawmaker in particular, Republican,
*05:39.260- 05:46.380* :  Congresswoman Kornancey Mace swore in the hearing accusing Ms Cheatle of being really dishonest.
*05:46.380- 05:50.620* :  They just weren't happy with the answers. Ms Cheatle said, look, I can't answer these questions
*05:50.620- 05:55.420* :  because an investigation has under way, but I do think that her stonewalling essentially did
*05:55.440- 06:01.680* :  seal her fate. So where does her decision to step down leave the investigation into what happened
*06:01.740- 06:08.360* :  at the Trump rally? Well, the deputy of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, he will stand in for the
*06:08.360- 06:14.160* :  moment. The investigation will still continue. And in terms of the hearing, that's still continuing
*06:14.160- 06:19.960* :  on the Capitol. So you've got the Homeland Security Department holding a hearing as well. You've
*06:19.960- 06:26.240* :  got the head of Pennsylvania police and local law enforcement being questioned as well about
*06:26.240- 06:32.180* :  the security failures that day. And will Kimberly Cheatle's resignation in any way calm nerves
*06:32.180- 06:37.560* :  in Washington? I think to a certain extent it will because the Secret Service has been
*06:37.560- 06:42.380* :  blighted with a lot of problems over the years and there's not been a huge amount of confidence
*06:42.560- 06:46.980* :  in the Secret Service. It's obviously one of the most important agencies in this country.
*06:46.980- 06:53.180* :  A lot of Republicans and Democrats felt that her stepping down was the only way to restore
*06:53.180- 07:00.300* :  some sense of confidence. So I think that's probably why she's done it as well. But for lawmaker
*07:00.300- 07:04.860* :  certainly that's what they were wanting yesterday and that's what they've got. Nomiya Ikbal.
*07:06.000- 07:11.460* :  Kamala Harris hit the US campaign trail on Tuesday, having already secured enough backing
*07:11.460- 07:17.640* :  to be formally selected next month as the Democratic presidential contender. She addressed
*07:17.640- 07:23.400* :  Arali in Milwaukee in Wisconsin. Her first rally since President Biden withdrew from the race.
*07:24.280- 07:30.360* :  Supporters queuing up to enter the rally were enthusiastic. I am super excited about Kamala.
*07:30.620- 07:37.780* :  She is the perfect candidate to run against Trump. I'm excited that she's giving us a platform
*07:37.780- 07:43.360* :  for the future, not a platform for the past. I think that Kamala Harris has completely
*07:43.360- 07:49.200* :  invigorated the entire base of the Democratic Party. Young people are going to come out
*07:49.760- 07:55.500* :  in a way that they weren't going to come out before. There's only one old man in the race now
*07:56.300- 08:00.980* :  and it's not Joe Biden. It's just something new, something. I think we need somebody new.
*08:01.800- 08:07.400* :  Well, the Vice President spoke to a loud, large and appreciative audience who chanted her name
*08:07.500- 08:08.820* :  as she approached the podium.
*08:13.980- 08:26.000* :  And as she spoke, Kamala Harris made it clear that she's very much running on her past record.
*08:26.580- 08:31.080* :  I was elected Attorney General of the State of California and I was a courtroom prosecutor before then.
*08:32.480- 08:37.300* :  And in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds.
*08:40.040- 08:52.640* :  Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules
*08:52.640- 09:00.720* :  for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type.
*09:05.220- 09:10.960* :  Our correspondent, Anthony Zerco, was following events. Some of what Miss Harris had to say may
*09:10.960- 09:16.580* :  have sounded familiar, but did it go down well? It did. The contrast between Kamala Harris
*09:16.580- 09:21.360* :  event, this Kamala Harris event and the Joe Biden campaign events I've been covering for the past
*09:21.380- 09:27.580* :  year, year and a half was dramatic. The crowd was so enthusiastic they were engaged with what
*09:27.580- 09:31.940* :  the Vice President was saying. And she was in a very direct way as you heard there,
*09:31.940- 09:36.960* :  drawing the contrast between herself and her background as a criminal prosecutor and Donald
*09:36.960- 09:40.200* :  Trump. That's actually something that Kamala Harris didn't do when she ran for President
*09:40.720- 09:46.640* :  in 2020. She didn't talk as much about that prosecutorial background, but now it looks like she's
*09:46.640- 09:52.180* :  going to make it a central point in her campaign. Democratic endorsements have been building up
*09:52.180- 09:56.820* :  monies being pouring in. Is there a chance that it won't be her as candidate?
*09:58.380- 10:03.480* :  Well, it's looking increasingly unlikely. She has secured the commitments from a majority of
*10:03.480- 10:08.520* :  the delegates to the Democratic National Convention at the end of August. Those are the people
*10:08.520- 10:13.660* :  who will determine who the nominee is. And just in a matter of days, she has locked down that support.
*10:13.660- 10:18.700* :  So unless there are some dramatic shifts, something that changes the support and makes these
*10:18.700- 10:23.760* :  people move away after committing to Kamala Harris, the nomination is hers to lock up or campaign
*10:23.760- 10:29.140* :  already is referring to her as the presumptive nominee. And you mentioned those endorsements,
*10:29.520- 10:34.340* :  virtually all of her potential rivals for the nomination have endorsed her and top Democrats
*10:34.340- 10:38.860* :  across the board have endorsed her. The only one who has it as of so far is former President
*10:38.860- 10:44.560* :  Barack Obama who has remained silent. That man in the queue wasn't the first to say there's only one
*10:44.560- 10:49.420* :  old man left in the race now. How has Donald Trump reacted?
*10:50.980- 10:55.560* :  Well, Donald Trump has gone on the attack against Democrats as the process where Joe Biden
*10:55.560- 11:01.900* :  stepped down and endorsed Kamala Harris being unfair. And he has also specifically targeted Kamala
*11:01.900- 11:07.580* :  Harris saying that she is too liberal and also trying to tie her to the immigration policies
*11:07.580- 11:13.240* :  of the Biden administration, which public opinion polls show are generally viewed unfavorably.
*11:13.240- 11:17.840* :  So they want to make her the face of the immigration policies for the Biden administration
*11:18.000- 11:23.340* :  and also tie her to the economic issues, rise in inflation, everything else that some voters find
*11:23.340- 11:30.140* :  distasteful about the past four years. Anthony Zurker talking to Paul Henley will after Joe Biden
*11:30.140- 11:36.100* :  endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, misleading claims about both of them surfaced
*11:36.100- 11:42.560* :  online, including Warner ledging that Mr. Biden is in fact dead. And this is why Ms. Harris has
*11:42.560- 11:48.380* :  replaced him. Cheyenne Sardarizadi from BBC Verify has been looking at the claims.
*11:48.840- 11:54.340* :  This is one of those bizarre ones that the last 24 hours we've seen being shared by some sort of
*11:54.340- 11:59.640* :  right-wing influential accounts online and they're claiming that there's some sort of a cover-up
*11:59.640- 12:04.220* :  going on in the White House and the letter that we saw from Joe Biden's official account posted
*12:04.220- 12:09.920* :  to the platform X announcing his dropping out of the presidential race and then endorsing
*12:10.420- 12:15.340* :  Kamala Harris later that that particular letter was not signed by him and might have been
*12:15.340- 12:20.300* :  written by somebody else for him and that Joe Biden has not been seen in public for several days
*12:20.940- 12:25.380* :  and then the phone call that he made to Kamala Harris the yesterday while she was at a rally
*12:25.380- 12:30.120* :  might have been a recorded voice and then the news that he's going to address the nation that
*12:30.120- 12:35.000* :  might again be a recorded message. I mean it's really bizarre in the sense that we know that
*12:35.280- 12:40.080* :  President Biden has had COVID and has been resting and recovering and I'm assuming that
*12:40.360- 12:44.340* :  I'm going to see the real deal by then at a presentation. What more would he have to do in that
*12:44.340- 12:49.160* :  speech hold up a copy of that day's newspaper to say look I'm really here I mean at what point
*12:49.160- 12:52.720* :  if he's giving a video a national address in the White House would people simply say well I
*12:52.720- 12:58.000* :  don't believe it. I mean I don't know James like honestly some of this stuff can get really
*12:58.000- 13:02.020* :  bizarre today we've been tracking some of them you know 20 million views 30 million views you
*13:02.020- 13:07.980* :  genuinely sort of wonder from you know perfectly legitimate activists on the right people who
*13:07.980- 13:12.460* :  you know a lot of people listen to have massive influence I mean it's it's genuinely bizarre I
*13:12.460- 13:17.040* :  mean we all sort of we both journalists and we have skepticism about anything that politicians do
*13:17.040- 13:22.040* :  and say but you know this is sort of taking it a bit too far. And there've been misleading false
*13:22.040- 13:27.040* :  claims about Kamala Harris as well. Yeah the night that President Biden dropped out and
*13:27.040- 13:32.060* :  in those Kamala Harris so immediately saw some pieces of fake news being shared about her one of
*13:32.060- 13:37.900* :  them was an image of her an edited fake image of her standing alongside Jeffrey Epstein the sort of
*13:37.900- 13:43.880* :  sex offender and notorious figure who's now dead obviously that image was not real that was edited
*13:43.880- 13:49.120* :  we found the real image from you know dating back to 2015 she was standing next to her husband
*13:49.760- 13:54.020* :  and then there was a deep fake video of her speaking very coherently and saying bizarre things
*13:54.020- 13:59.300* :  that wasn't again real we found the real video posted to Facebook from last year at the rally
*13:59.300- 14:04.400* :  at the university and then there was sort of recycled claims back in 2019 Kamala Harris obviously
*14:04.400- 14:09.340* :  ran for president unsuccessfully dropped out of the democratic primaries but at the time that she
*14:09.340- 14:13.320* :  ran there were claims that she couldn't you know she wouldn't be eligible to run for president
*14:13.320- 14:17.580* :  because her parents were not born in the United States at the time constitutional experts
*14:17.580- 14:22.080* :  are clarified that that was not the case because she was born in America she was born in California
*14:22.600- 14:25.880* :  and as an actual board citizen she would be perfectly allowed to run for president
*14:26.580- 14:33.360* :  Cheyenne Sardarizade talking to James Reynolds as we record this podcast Spain's foreign minister
*14:33.360- 14:37.760* :  has said that 14 people have been rescued in a major operation in the South Atlantic
*14:38.280- 14:42.340* :  after the crew of a fishing vessel the Argos Georgia had to abandon ship
*14:42.940- 14:48.640* :  but Jose Manuel Arbaris told Spain's public broadcaster that one person was confirmed to have
*14:48.640- 14:52.440* :  died and at least two others were missing here's Danny Abahad
*14:53.040- 14:58.820* :  this is an extremely complicated rescue with Gail Force winds and waves reported to be 8 meters high
*14:59.540- 15:04.280* :  the Argos Georgia got into trouble on Monday some 200 nautical miles off the Falklands
*15:04.380- 15:10.800* :  known in the Spanish-speaking world as Las Malvinas it sank overnight according to Spain's foreign
*15:10.800- 15:16.300* :  minister those on board included nationals of Spain, Uruguay, Peru, Russia and Indonesia
*15:17.160- 15:21.300* :  the Falklands government said the life rafts were located and tracked by planes
*15:22.140- 15:26.840* :  the first attempt to rescue the crew had failed when a helicopter operating at the limits of
*15:26.840- 15:32.360* :  its range had to turn back a patrol boat and two other fishing vessels also joined the search
*15:32.980- 15:33.920* :  Danny Abahad
*15:34.840- 15:39.860* :  scientists in Brazil have found that multiple sharks have tested positive for cocaine
*15:40.780- 15:45.720* :  experts believe cocaine is making its way into the sea through the manufacturing process
*15:45.720- 15:52.020* :  at illegal labs or through sewage from people who've taken the drug. Ella Bicknell has more.
*15:52.400- 15:56.920* :  Researchers from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation tested 13 sharp nose sharks
*15:56.920- 16:01.880* :  as more species little threat to humans who ran the waters of Rio de Janeiro
*16:02.400- 16:06.260* :  all 13 were found to have high levels of cocaine in their system
*16:06.940- 16:12.320* :  in fact concentrations were up to 100 times higher than previously reported in other aquatic
*16:12.320- 16:18.080* :  creatures which researchers say is having a harmful impact on their eyesight, hunting skills
*16:18.080- 16:23.780* :  and overall life expectancy. Dr. Janis Papa star me to you is from Florida International
*16:23.860- 16:30.280* :  University he's spent over 25 years researching sharks. This is the first time that actually
*16:30.280- 16:36.380* :  cocaine has been detected in the muscle of sharks we've detected it in other animals before but
*16:36.580- 16:40.940* :  this is at a higher concentration than you see in in other animals. It's not clear where the
*16:40.940- 16:46.820* :  cocaine has come from one theory is it's a spill over from illicit drug laboratories in the area
*16:46.820- 16:53.000* :  another is that it's an overflow of Rio's untreated sewage. There may actually be quite a lot of
*16:53.000- 16:57.660* :  illegal sewage sort of effluent as well so because of that obviously you're not getting the
*16:57.660- 17:04.140* :  filtering you may get in other places and so that is probably going to be a first step in terms
*17:04.140- 17:09.060* :  of something you can actually address rather than the much more difficult sort of problem of
*17:09.060- 17:13.960* :  tackling as they drug use. However it's not just sharks and it's not just cocaine.
*17:14.360- 17:20.000* :  A real mixture of things over the counts of medicines, fixing medicines, fat remediscence,
*17:20.200- 17:25.660* :  pesticides, personal care products, the things like UV filters in your sunscreens, all of those
*17:25.660- 17:30.360* :  will be going out into the environment. That's Alistair Boxel from the University of York in England.
*17:30.360- 17:35.820* :  Their 2022 research sample more than a thousand river sites in a hundred countries
*17:35.820- 17:41.420* :  for all kinds of drugs. The concentrations of what they found were so high more than a quarter
*17:41.420- 17:46.880* :  were deemed unsafe for aquatic life. It follows research published last month from the Swedish
*17:46.880- 17:51.820* :  University of Agricultural Sciences. They found brown trout addicted to unfettered
*17:51.820- 17:57.720* :  min and some fish populations undergoing sex reversals because of an exposure to the contraceptive
*17:57.720- 18:04.080* :  pill. So drugs are changing animal biochemistry. How about their behaviour? Well the Oswaldo
*18:04.080- 18:08.320* :  Cruise Foundation says there's still more research to do on this especially for the sharp
*18:08.320- 18:14.480* :  no shark. Dr. Boxel agrees but he says action can be taken now to improve water pollution.
*18:15.140- 18:19.520* :  There are a number of ways in which we can fix the problem. Obviously we can reduce the use of
*18:19.520- 18:23.880* :  Alistair drugs then that's going to reduce the pressure on the environment. The pharmaceutical
*18:23.880- 18:29.240* :  companies they could be designing greener drugs, the drugs that degrade in the environment.
*18:29.660- 18:34.060* :  And there are ways in which we can treat these substances so there are things that we can
*18:34.080- 18:38.960* :  put on to the end of wastewater treatment work. So as the wastewater comes into the works it goes
*18:38.960- 18:43.660* :  through the typical processes and then it goes through further cleaning steps which then
*18:43.660- 18:49.060* :  removes these substances so that the effluent coming out again into the river has much lower
*18:49.060- 18:55.140* :  concentrations than it would do today. However in Brazil, Swedish remains a problem with millions
*18:55.140- 19:01.120* :  without access to clean water. In 2020 the government announced a new legal framework for the
*19:01.120- 19:07.720* :  aim to collect and treat 90% of Brazil's sewage by 2033. Ella Bickner reporting.
*19:10.960- 19:15.800* :  Still to come. There's a new HIV infection somewhere in the world every 24 seconds.
*19:16.280- 19:22.860* :  Somebody dies of HIV every minute but this new drug gives us the prospect of shutting down HIV
*19:22.860- 19:29.000* :  transmission and then we could start talking about eliminating HIV. Scientists push for a new
*19:29.000- 19:31.780* :  AIDS vaccine to be made available across the globe.
*19:40.680- 19:46.040* :  This podcast is brought to you by eHarmony. The dating app to find someone you can be yourself with.
*19:46.660- 19:51.000* :  Why doesn't eHarmony allow copy and piece in first messages? Because you are unique

*20:10.500- 20:14.840* :  Ryan Reynolds here from intmobile. With the price of just about everything going up during inflation
*20:14.840- 20:20.400* :  we thought we'd bring our prices down so to help us we brought in a reverse auctioneer which is
*20:43.100- 20:50.060* :  apparently a thing. The World Health Organization says it's extremely worried about the threat posed
*20:50.060- 20:57.740* :  by polio in Gaza. Traces of the virus were found in sewage samples last week. So far no cases have
*20:57.740- 21:04.160* :  been identified but the WHO warns that the breakdown of water and sanitation services means an
*21:04.160- 21:09.560* :  outbreak could spread rapidly to disastrous effect. Imagine folks reports from Geneva.
*21:10.180- 21:17.220* :  A WHO team is on the way to Gaza to try to get a clear picture of the polio risk but the fact
*21:17.220- 21:24.100* :  the virus has already been found in sewage makes health officials very worried. Thousands of people
*21:24.100- 21:31.240* :  in Gaza are living in makeshift shelters with just one toilet for hundreds. The advice to wash
*21:31.240- 21:38.440* :  hands regularly and drink only safe water will be impossible for many. The summer heat and lack
*21:38.440- 21:44.900* :  of sanitation create perfect conditions for the spread of disease. When traces of the virus were
*21:44.900- 21:52.120* :  found last week Israel began vaccinating its troops. The WHO has told the Israeli government
*21:52.120- 21:59.460* :  that mass vaccination across Gaza may be necessary but regular delays for aid workers and supplies
*22:00.100- 22:06.660* :  and huge security risks moving around mean an effective vaccination campaign will be very
*22:06.700- 22:14.720* :  challenging. Immigrant folks. Security is always uppermost in the minds of Olympic games organizers
*22:15.480- 22:21.140* :  and this year in Paris more than most. These games are occurring with the continuing war in Gaza.
*22:21.500- 22:27.220* :  With memories of the massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Games in 1972 there's
*22:27.220- 22:33.380* :  extra security for the Israelis arriving in France. The opening ceremony on Friday will take place
*22:33.380- 22:39.340* :  in the heart of the French capital prompting a massive security operation involving French soldiers
*22:39.340- 22:50.460* :  and police. Andrew Harding has this report. It's a bright morning in Paris and I'm at one of
*22:51.100- 22:56.840* :  many dozens of checkpoints which are cropped up here in the last few days. Manned by police and
*22:56.840- 23:02.720* :  John Downs causing some bottlenecks, some headaches for people who don't always have the right
*23:02.720- 23:09.860* :  paperwork. That's the beep of a QR code being scanned. Everyone has to have one on their phone
*23:09.860- 23:14.260* :  in order to get through one of these checkpoints and further into the heart of Paris.
*23:15.600- 23:18.720* :  I'm going to a shop. I'll really stay tonnery.
*23:22.960- 23:27.660* :  These unprecedented security precautions are designed to protect Friday night's Olympic
*23:27.660- 23:33.180* :  opening ceremony which will happen not in a stadium but on the river saying itself inevitably
*23:33.260- 23:38.800* :  there've been some teething issues. We're from BBC News and we ask you are you feeling about
*23:38.800- 23:44.240* :  all this? It's complicated. I just wanted to make an exchange at a shop and I'm going to need
*23:44.240- 23:50.860* :  to go really far out of my way but I still love Paris. I'm from Mexico. So you don't have the code
*23:50.860- 23:57.080* :  you need. No. That's a shame. Yes. How do you feel about that? Sad.
*23:59.140- 24:05.800* :  Well this is a very strange feeling. I'm standing in the middle of an empty road on an empty street
*24:05.800- 24:12.200* :  outside half a dozen empty cafes and bistros in the heart of Paris right outside Notre Dame.
*24:12.920- 24:20.060* :  It's two in the afternoon and this is the result of the security clamp down here across central
*24:20.060- 24:26.160* :  Paris. My name is Omar bin Abdullah. And you're a waiter here? Yeah. And have you ever seen
*24:26.160- 24:33.460* :  it so empty? No. Never. No business notorious. Yes. Economic is done. Yes.
*24:38.560- 24:43.200* :  On the outskirts of Paris elite French police rehearse an Olympic hostage operation.
*24:44.260- 24:47.860* :  Storming a bus to rescue actors pretending to be held captive.
*24:48.740- 24:53.940* :  It's part of what we're told is the biggest peacetime security operation in French history with
*24:53.940- 25:00.840* :  10,000 French soldiers also taking part. Simon Rionne is the head of the police unit doing the hostage
*25:00.840- 25:08.640* :  training. France decided to make this opening ceremony a unique moment to show Paris to have
*25:08.640- 25:15.160* :  the ceremony within the city and being part of it makes us really proud. It's our duty to protect
*25:15.960- 25:21.640* :  French citizens but also all the tourists, all the athletes that are coming to the Olympics. So
*25:21.640- 25:30.400* :  we're extremely proud to be part of such a unique moment. And that's French President
*25:30.400- 25:37.860* :  Emmanuel Macron insisting we're ready. In recent years France has experienced multiple deadly
*25:37.860- 25:43.820* :  attacks by Islamist militants. It's also increasingly concerned about Russian cyber attacks and
*25:44.080- 25:51.940* :  misinformation campaigns. But as final preparations are being made here along the river
*25:51.940- 25:58.500* :  send this afternoon the calculation is that any risks and inconveniences are comfortably outweighed
*25:58.520- 26:03.860* :  by the opportunity on Friday evening to showcase Paris to a watching world.
*26:06.320- 26:07.720* :  Andrew Harding reporting
*26:09.500- 26:15.540* :  Scientists at an international AIDS conference in Munich say a drug likely to be a game changer
*26:15.540- 26:22.200* :  for HIV prevention could be produced at a fraction of its current cost. Every year just under one and
*26:22.200- 26:29.760* :  a half million people are infected with HIV. 630,000 people died from AIDS related illnesses last year.
*26:30.760- 26:36.560* :  The potentially revolutionary drug is called Lena Capavir. It's made by pharmaceutical giant
*26:36.560- 26:44.440* :  Giliad and it currently costs over $40,000 per patient per year. But that could and should change,
*26:44.440- 26:49.980* :  according to Dr Andrew Hill, a researcher at the University of Liverpool who's just presented
*26:49.980- 26:56.460* :  his findings in Munich. So this is an injection people can take once every six months and they get
*26:56.800- 27:02.540* :  according to the current evidence 100% protection from HIV infection. We've never had this before.
*27:02.540- 27:08.700* :  This is as close to an HIV vaccine as we've ever been. People don't need to remember to take pills,
*27:08.700- 27:14.860* :  they don't need to buy them, they don't collect them. It's also a lot more discreet. So women might
*27:14.860- 27:19.360* :  go to a clinic where they're having a family planning advisor that being vaccinated for other diseases
*27:19.900- 27:24.400* :  and they can get this protection at the same time so nobody knows. The problem at the moment is the cost.
*27:26.160- 27:34.320* :  So the US Drug Company Giliad is charging over $40,000 for a year of this drug and we've calculated
*27:34.320- 27:42.220* :  that it could be mass-produced for only $40,000 so a thousand of the price being charged by the US
*27:42.220- 27:47.660* :  Drug Company. But the drug company that owns it at the moment would have to be involved and
*27:47.660- 27:51.320* :  presumably their goodwill would be involved in issuing generic licenses.
*27:52.540- 27:58.840* :  Yes, so any drug company can give permission for the drugs to be made to be given in poor
*27:58.880- 28:06.320* :  countries and that's what we have for HIV treatment. So you'll have 25 million people mainly in Africa
*28:07.060- 28:13.320* :  given copies of drug companies drugs for a fraction of the price and that system has worked very
*28:13.320- 28:19.060* :  well for the last 20 years. We're just asking this company to do it again for this new treatment
*28:19.060- 28:22.680* :  to preventage of infection. And what are the prospects of this working out?
*28:23.240- 28:29.300* :  The problem this time is they seem to be dragging their feet. They haven't gone to the drug companies
*28:29.300- 28:34.580* :  in India and China and started making the arrangements and when they've done this in the past they've
*28:34.640- 28:40.120* :  missed out North Africa, South America, Eastern Europe, Central Asia. Now those are the regions where
*28:40.600- 28:46.240* :  HIV is growing the most quickly. We need an agreement that covers all low and middle income
*28:46.240- 28:52.180* :  countries and that's where 95% of HIV infections are seen. The United Nations is already involved
*28:52.180- 28:56.800* :  in these negotiations. There was a speech by an undersecretary general of the United Nations
*28:57.340- 29:02.940* :  at the conference last night saying, Gilead, do the right thing include all the low and middle income
*29:02.940- 29:07.600* :  countries, make sure this happens. There are people in the US government involved in this.
*29:07.860- 29:12.980* :  Everybody wants this to happen. It's up to Gilead now to do the right thing and get this drug
*29:13.320- 29:17.780* :  at a very affordable price too. Everybody needs it. There's a new HIV infection,
*29:18.360- 29:24.200* :  summer in the world every 24 seconds. Somebody dies of HIV every minute, summer in the world.
*29:24.200- 29:30.600* :  But this new drug gives us the prospect of shutting down HIV transmission and then we could
*29:30.600- 29:35.960* :  start talking about eliminating HIV. Dr Andrew Hill talking to Paul Henley.
*29:37.120- 29:41.860* :  Let's end in Romania where the government has voted in favour of a bear culp
*29:42.040- 29:45.740* :  following the fatal attack of a 19 year old woman at the start of the month.
*29:46.380- 29:50.840* :  Our correspondent Nick Thorpe has been out to see the animals in their natural habitat
*29:51.240- 29:52.080* :  and sent this report.
*29:56.480- 30:01.240* :  It's 6.30 in the evening near the town of Tushnad in the forests of Transylvania.
*30:01.960- 30:07.920* :  About 10 metres from where I'm lying, two female bears and three bear cubs are munching through
*30:07.920- 30:14.440* :  the corn scattered by a forest ranger a short time ago. If you listen carefully you can hear them
*30:14.440- 30:24.920* :  eating the corn. The new law overturns a moratorium on hunting bears which came into force in
*30:24.920- 30:32.340* :  2016. It was introduced in response to the killing by a bear of a 19 year old woman hiking with
*30:32.340- 30:38.240* :  her boyfriend in the Bruccegi Mountains on the 9th of July. The law will allow what's called
*30:38.240- 30:46.120* :  the preventative shooting of 426 bears till the end of 2025. And the shooting of another 55
*30:46.120- 30:51.980* :  bears identified as threatening humans, raiding bins around towns and villages.
*30:52.900- 30:58.440* :  The government and hunters organisations say the measure is needed because bears have come to see
*30:58.440- 31:04.300* :  humans as a source of food. Wildlife groups, including the Worldwide Fund for Nature,
*31:04.780- 31:10.160* :  argue that the new law will not solve bear human conflicts as the wrong bears,
*31:10.160- 31:16.040* :  those that cause no problems for humans, deep in the mountains, will be shot unnecessarily,
*31:16.460- 31:19.780* :  often by trophy hunters. Nick Thorpe reporting.
*31:22.840- 31:27.460* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.

*32:13.180- 32:19.760* :  Carmel Harris now lead a United Democratic Party in November? And what does it mean for the Trump
