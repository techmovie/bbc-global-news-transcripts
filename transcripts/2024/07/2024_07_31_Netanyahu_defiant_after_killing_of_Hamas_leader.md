*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:12.560* :  from across the world, the latest news 7 days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:46.480- 00:52.920* :  The whole scale of it is just, it's mesmerizing. All of those bodies and all of the families.
*01:04.380- 01:07.480* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:09.560- 01:14.200* :  I'm Andrew Patron in the early hours of Thursday, the 1st of August. These are our main stories.
*01:14.220- 01:20.980* :  A defined Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel has delivered crushing blows to all its enemies. Iran
*01:20.980- 01:25.880* :  vows to avenge the killing of the Hamas political leader. And we'll get reaction from the father
*01:25.880- 01:33.180* :  of an Israeli hostage. Also in this podcast, the contested Venezuela's way to an election are seen
*01:33.180- 01:40.800* :  by international observers and... She was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian
*01:40.800- 01:45.100* :  heritage. I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn
*01:45.100- 01:50.820* :  black and now she wants to be known as black. Donald Trump questions Kamala Harris' racial identity
*01:50.820- 01:58.840* :  at an event for black journalists. The Israeli government says it's on extremely higher
*01:58.840- 02:04.100* :  alert following the killing of a senior Hamas leader Ismar Haneer in Tehran and a commander of
*02:04.100- 02:09.620* :  the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in Beirut. Speaking on television in his first public statement
*02:09.620- 02:15.160* :  since the strikes, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu didn't mention Mr Haneer but said
*02:15.160- 02:24.760* :  Israel would settle its score with anyone who harmed it. Anyone who slaughters our children,
*02:25.380- 02:32.360* :  anyone who murders our citizens, anyone who hits our country, his blood beyond his own head.
*02:32.380- 02:38.700* :  Citizens of Israel challenging days lie ahead. Since the strike in Beirut, there are threats
*02:38.700- 02:44.560* :  sounding from all directions. We are prepared for any scenario and we will stand united and
*02:44.560- 02:51.060* :  determined against any threat. Israel will exact a heavy price for any aggression against us from
*02:51.060- 02:56.280* :  any arena. Iran has promised harsh punishment for the killing of Mr Haneer who is visiting the
*02:56.280- 03:01.200* :  Iranian capital for the inauguration of the new president. Across the West Bank, demonstrators
*03:01.200- 03:06.360* :  march through the streets, waving the green banners of Hamas, chanting slogans of defiance.
*03:06.360- 03:11.640* :  The moderate Palestinian politician Mustafa Barguiti who doesn't support Hamas was among them.
*03:11.960- 03:18.260* :  Israel had just committed a terrible criminal political act by assassinating a political leader.
*03:19.000- 03:23.260* :  They've assassinated the person they were negotiating with about a ceasefire.
*03:23.920- 03:27.320* :  So this sends very clear message to Palestinians. Israel doesn't want peace,
*03:27.620- 03:32.100* :  Israel doesn't want ceasefire. All Israel understands is only the language of force.
*03:32.860- 03:36.400* :  Hamid Ali's correspondent in Jerusalem, Barbara Pettusher, is following developments.
*03:36.400- 03:39.820* :  I asked her first about Mr Netanyahu's TV address.
*03:40.140- 03:44.040* :  He used his statement to basically say to the citizens of Israel,
*03:44.040- 03:50.020* :  challenging days lie ahead, and that Israel would respond forcefully to any attack on it.
*03:50.020- 03:53.980* :  He said since the strike in Beirut against that has ballacamander, threats had been coming
*03:53.980- 04:00.220* :  from all directions, but that Israel would deliver a crushing blow to militants aligned with Iran
*04:00.380- 04:03.680* :  that had had done over the past few days, and that it would continue to do so.
*04:04.560- 04:09.700* :  So a very defiant tone, both in the clip you heard there, but also in terms of what he said
*04:09.700- 04:15.000* :  were threats coming from the region. He did, however, not say anything about the strike on Ismail Hania
*04:15.620- 04:19.820* :  in Iran, though the Israelis have not commented on that, and he didn't, he himself didn't either.
*04:19.980- 04:24.540* :  Yes, I was intrigued by that. He was somewhat coy about it. He sort of wants to claim the win
*04:24.540- 04:28.020* :  without actually claiming the win in details specifically.
*04:28.760- 04:33.800* :  Well, he talked about strikes against Hamas and Hezbollah in general. He was referring
*04:33.800- 04:39.620* :  to several strikes against Hamas leaders. One was killed in Beirut in January.
*04:39.660- 04:46.620* :  Israelis believe they may have killed the military leader of Hamas's, the leader of Hamas's
*04:46.620- 04:50.020* :  military wing, although that hasn't been confirmed. They say they killed his deputy.
*04:50.760- 04:55.920* :  So he could have been speaking more broadly about the strikes against Hamas, but certainly
*04:56.600- 05:02.200* :  shortly after the war began, he did tell reporters that he had ordered Israel's foreign
*05:02.200- 05:06.640* :  intelligence service to act against the heads of Hamas wherever they are. I don't think there's
*05:06.840- 05:10.400* :  I think there's very little doubt that it wasn't Israel, but they don't tend to claim
*05:10.400- 05:14.880* :  allegations of assassination attempts against them, especially when they happen in Iran.
*05:15.180- 05:20.320* :  Okay. And unlike its military leaders, the political leader of Hamas,
*05:20.320- 05:24.160* :  this Marhaneer, lived his life out in the open, people knew where he was.
*05:24.160- 05:30.400* :  So it's probably not the first opportunity Israel has had to kill this person. Why now?
*05:31.760- 05:38.500* :  Well, it's a good question. Some analysts believe that it wasn't related to the strike on
*05:38.500- 05:43.020* :  the Hezbollah commander. In other words, they weren't trying to increase the pressure deliberately
*05:43.020- 05:49.780* :  on several fronts. It's that it was more likely opportunistic. Mr. Haneer did move between
*05:49.780- 05:54.560* :  Qatar and Turkey a lot. I think it would have been more problematic for the Israelis to strike
*05:54.560- 05:59.200* :  him either of those two countries in terms of their relations with the governments of those
*05:59.200- 06:06.340* :  countries. But they have struck targets in Iran before. So that makes it easier. Now he was for
*06:06.340- 06:11.460* :  them. I mean, now he was in Iran a couple of times over the past year and including in May.
*06:11.460- 06:16.560* :  So why now? It seems that they were able to gather very precise intelligence about him and where
*06:16.560- 06:22.540* :  he was. Perhaps this is speculation, but perhaps because he was attending an event that was scheduled,
*06:22.540- 06:28.280* :  the inauguration of the new president, because they did have quite precise intelligence. There were
*06:28.280- 06:33.560* :  other Hamas leaders or officials in the same building as he was as well as the head of a Palestinian
*06:33.560- 06:40.580* :  Islamic jihad. And it was only he and his bodyguard that were killed. So it seems as if that might
*06:40.580- 06:46.200* :  have been the reason. But certainly many people in the region believe that this was a deliberate attempt
*06:46.200- 06:52.260* :  to sabotage ceasefire negotiations because it seems so to so directly impact the ceasefire talks.
*06:52.460- 06:57.180* :  Barbara Plattasha with me from Jerusalem. So how may Iran respond to all of this? A question
*06:57.180- 07:04.240* :  I put to Kazranaji from BBC Persian. When things like this happen, space opens for the hardliners
*07:04.240- 07:11.780* :  in Iraq. Okay, we have a relatively moderate president at the moment who's just started his work.
*07:12.240- 07:19.400* :  And he has been saying all the nice things about wanting to reestablish relations with the outside
*07:19.400- 07:25.900* :  world, put Iran on a new footing with the outside world and the international community. He wants to
*07:25.900- 07:33.360* :  talk and have dialogue, lift sanctions against Iran, all that stuff. But when this kind of thing
*07:33.360- 07:40.800* :  happens, hardliners take over. And also don't forget that the regional policies in Iran are out
*07:40.800- 07:48.480* :  of the hands of the president and it's led mostly by Iran's supreme leader through the revolutionary
*07:48.480- 07:54.040* :  guard. Up until now, we cast our minds back to October the 7th. There have been a number of
*07:54.040- 08:00.320* :  provocations and reasons why Iran may have chosen to escalate this conflict. And they've chosen not
*08:00.320- 08:06.360* :  to. Would it be different now? I don't think from my reading is that neither Iran nor all these
*08:06.360- 08:15.160* :  proxies, nor Hasbola or anybody else really wants to see a full scale war. But war is a possibility.
*08:15.160- 08:23.280* :  Given the fact that Iran is threatening to give a strong response to Israel. So I'm expecting
*08:23.340- 08:27.960* :  some kind of a big thing from Iran probably sooner rather than later.
*08:29.000- 08:33.100* :  As well as the prospect of a further regional escalation of the conflict in Gaza,
*08:33.100- 08:39.640* :  Ismar Hania's death casts a shadow over negotiations to secure a ceasefire and free Israeli hostages
*08:39.640- 08:46.100* :  still being held by Hamas. One of them is 23-year-old Hirsh Polin who's abducted while he was at the
*08:46.100- 08:52.100* :  Supernova Music Festival. In April, Hamas released a short video of Hirsh with his lower left arm
*08:52.100- 08:58.240* :  missing apparently blown off during the attack. James Menendez spoke to his father John Polin and
*08:58.240- 09:03.120* :  asked for his reaction to the news of Ismar Hania's death. Obviously the timing is curious,
*09:03.120- 09:09.140* :  right? I'm a father of a hostage. We are in the midst of delicate sensitive negotiations and
*09:09.140- 09:15.880* :  it's really hard for me to understand as a father, not a geopolitician, not a diplomat. What
*09:16.200- 09:22.040* :  might be the implications on the situation here? And what are your thoughts about that? He was
*09:22.040- 09:29.040* :  Hamas's negotiator. Doesn't this set those negotiations to release the hostages back?
*09:29.040- 09:38.060* :  So one thing I've learned in 299 days is how little I guess I know about the geopolitics and global
*09:38.060- 09:44.760* :  diplomacy, I just find it so hard to dissect what could happen, what is the real strategy, what's
*09:44.760- 09:51.860* :  really going on. So absolutely, I look at it on the surface and say he's their lead or one of
*09:51.860- 09:57.360* :  their lead negotiators, how could it not set things back? On the other hand, I just don't know,
*09:57.940- 10:03.320* :  but part of me is really hopeful that it's a step back in order for all of us to take three steps
*10:03.320- 10:10.320* :  forward. The region is tense right now and what we all need, the whole region is a sense of
*10:10.320- 10:18.000* :  deescalation and calm and somewhere somehow as an optimist, I'm hopeful. And yet at this moment,
*10:18.000- 10:24.020* :  I mean, many people are saying that the risks of a much bigger configuration are as high as they've
*10:24.020- 10:30.920* :  ever been. And in that context, one wonders how the negotiations to try to reach a ceasefire
*10:30.920- 10:38.360* :  in Gaza and try to get the hostages home can happen. It's such a hard balance that we've
*10:38.620- 10:44.720* :  witnessed and that we've been subjected to for 299 days, which is to say, I absolutely
*10:44.720- 10:51.900* :  understand when anybody in the world has their innocent civilians attacked that region or that
*10:51.900- 10:58.840* :  country has a right to respond, but your question is correct to what end. At what points do we say,
*10:58.840- 11:03.980* :  we've responded enough, you've responded enough, we've all responded enough instead of continuing
*11:03.980- 11:09.580* :  to respond and further endangering people, more people, more innocents, more people suffering in
*11:09.580- 11:14.880* :  the region. We're all going to say we've gotten enough responses out of our systems. No,
*11:14.880- 11:20.500* :  for the good of the people, we're going to stop. I hope we're there. And it is, of course,
*11:20.500- 11:26.840* :  an agonizing wait for you and the other families. Do you have any more information about how
*11:26.840- 11:33.280* :  harsh is since that video appeared back in April? I do not. And you just used the right word. It is
*11:33.280- 11:40.660* :  an agonizing wait for the hostage families. We were strengthened to see a video on day 201,
*11:40.700- 11:47.240* :  a video that no parent would ever want to see of their loved one. His arm blown off, he's looking
*11:47.240- 11:53.840* :  gaunt and pale and has some bruising on his head. And as parents, we see things that give us a lot
*11:53.840- 12:00.940* :  of cause for concern. But it was for the first time in 201 days, an opportunity to hear his voice
*12:00.980- 12:08.900* :  and to see him. And that was incredibly strengthening for us. Since that time, 98 days ago,
*12:08.900- 12:16.340* :  we know nothing new. Rachel, my wife and I are by nature, optimistic people. Our optimism is
*12:16.580- 12:23.840* :  tested every moment of every day. But we maintain it. And we continue to open prey every day. That
*12:23.840- 12:29.300* :  today is the day that we see calm the region. And we see harsh walk back across the border into our
*12:29.300- 12:35.500* :  arms with the other hostages. And we can all move on from this terrible chapter. John Pollen with
*12:35.500- 12:41.220* :  James Melendez. Donald Trump, the Republican party's nominee for the US presidential election,
*12:41.220- 12:46.940* :  was in Chicago on Wednesday, addressing a gathering of the National Association of Black Journalists.
*12:47.620- 12:52.540* :  There was widespread criticism of the invitation, and many black journalists chose not to go.
*12:54.540- 12:58.560* :  Donald Trump was in combative mood. This event meant to be an hour long,
*12:58.600- 13:02.540* :  immediately went off the rails when Donald Trump took issue with the opening question.
*13:02.540- 13:07.340* :  He was asked by one of three journalists why black voters should trust him in light of comments
*13:07.340- 13:11.880* :  that he has made, which many have considered racist. He said the question was disgraceful and
*13:11.880- 13:18.160* :  called the journalist very rude. I have been the best president for the black population
*13:18.320- 13:24.040* :  since Abraham Lincoln. Better than President Johnson, I'm the voting right back.
*13:24.040- 13:28.640* :  Can you just start off a question and answer period, especially when you're 35 minutes late,
*13:28.920- 13:33.840* :  because you couldn't get your equipment to work in such a hostile manner. I think it's a disgrace.
*13:33.840- 13:38.860* :  Donald Trump also said Vice President Harris was probably a DEI higher in
*13:38.860- 13:43.600* :  simulating Shoney got her positioned due to the color of her skin. He went on to say she was
*13:43.600- 13:47.760* :  always promoting her Indian heritage and only turned black a few years ago.
*13:48.080- 13:51.760* :  She was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went,
*13:52.300- 13:57.300* :  she became a black person. Just to be clear, sir, do you think I think somebody should look into that?
*13:57.300- 14:01.480* :  Kamala Harris has always said she is biracial with an Indian mother and black father.
*14:01.960- 14:06.840* :  Throughout the interview, Mr. Trump's responses drew multiple gasps and shouts from the crowd.
*14:07.400- 14:10.040* :  He won just 12 percent of black voters in his election,
*14:10.040- 14:14.240* :  lost to Joe Biden in 2020, but his numbers did improve, especially with black men.
*14:14.240- 14:20.060* :  New poll suggest Kamala Harris has edged him out and effectively eliminated his lead in key
*14:20.060- 14:24.380* :  battleground states. Unorth America correspondent Nomea Eibar reporting.
*14:27.340- 14:32.180* :  And still to come. The children will be given a peanut powder in a daily dose
*14:32.200- 14:37.960* :  until they reach a top dose and they'll continue that top maintenance dose for a two-year period.
*14:38.140- 14:41.940* :  A world first in Australia to help babies allergic to peanuts.
*14:51.280- 14:57.820* :  This season Instacart has your back to school. As in, they've got your back to school lunch
*14:57.820- 15:02.720* :  favorites like snack packs and fresh fruit and they've got your back to school supplies like

*15:35.340- 15:40.340* :  Hi, I'm Simon Jack. And I'm Zingseng. And good bad billionaire is back for a new season now
*15:40.340- 15:45.120* :  from the BBC World Service. Every episode we pick a billionaire and we find out how they made
*15:45.120- 15:49.700* :  their money. And then we judge them are they good, bad or just another billionaire.
*15:50.040- 15:54.680* :  So who are some of the people that you'll hear about in season two? The richest comedian ever,
*15:54.680- 16:00.320* :  Jerry Seinfelds there. There's also my personal favorite story, the fashion designer who was once a
*16:00.340- 16:05.160* :  communist mind, that's mutual pride. And the people behind some of the biggest companies on the
*16:05.160- 16:11.220* :  planet, Google TikTok for example. But we are kicking off with a sporting superstar Tiger Woods.
*16:11.640- 16:16.440* :  Good bad billionaire from the BBC World Service. Listen now wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*16:24.400- 16:29.600* :  Nicholas Maduro finds himself increasingly isolated with his continued insistence that he was
*16:29.600- 16:35.120* :  reelected president of Venezuela on Sunday. The opposition say they have proved the election was
*16:35.120- 16:40.860* :  stolen and that their candidate Edmondo Gonzalez was the winner. Mr. Maduro's victory is also
*16:40.860- 16:46.380* :  disputed by many governments in the region including Argentina and Costa Rica. The organisation
*16:46.380- 16:51.940* :  of American state says the result was manipulated while the European unions as it won't recognise
*16:51.940- 16:57.520* :  the result until all data has been released. Only a few international observers were actually
*16:57.520- 17:02.220* :  allowed into Venezuela to monitor the election. One of them was Jonathan Stone Street from the
*17:02.220- 17:09.160* :  Carter Centre founded by the former US president Jimmy Carter. What we saw in Venezuela, not only
*17:09.160- 17:14.700* :  in the aftermath of election day but in the pre-election period, there were serious reaches of
*17:14.700- 17:21.320* :  international standards. On election day itself, we from our observations had the impression that
*17:21.860- 17:26.740* :  actually things were going pretty well during voting. There was some incidents but from what we saw
*17:26.740- 17:33.820* :  there was massive turnout and people were peaceful and voting calmly. But the process deteriorated
*17:33.820- 17:39.960* :  seriously on election night when the results were presented without any of the data from polling
*17:39.960- 17:45.200* :  stations that would allow observers or political parties to check the results that they had seen
*17:45.200- 17:50.660* :  in the polling station. It's just a fundamental job of the election commission to publish results
*17:50.660- 17:56.580* :  from the election that would be able to be verified so that people could see who won the election.
*17:56.580- 18:02.160* :  To me, in my experience as an election observer, that's something extraordinary.
*18:03.000- 18:07.520* :  Colombia's former president Ernesto Sampa was also invited to observe the election.
*18:07.920- 18:09.940* :  Julian Marshall asked him what he saw on the day.
*18:13.820- 18:18.060* :  The elections went ahead normally. All the polling stations worked properly.
*18:18.060- 18:21.200* :  We could meet all the spokesperson of the opposition and the government.
*18:21.200- 18:26.220* :  After the closing of the polling stations, which took place between six and seven o'clock at night,
*18:26.760- 18:31.640* :  the system was supposed to automatically begin to show the results and the polling stations were
*18:31.640- 18:35.780* :  supposed to report to the central office in Caracas in order to get a total of the votes.
*18:36.380- 18:41.100* :  According to the accusations later made by the government, it was during this process,
*18:41.660- 18:46.440* :  when there was a hacking that prevented it from functioning in an appropriate way as it
*18:46.440- 18:58.400* :  is always function. So the government says the system got hacked, but the organization of
*18:58.400- 19:06.940* :  American states has said that there was a manipulation of the vote. Would you go along with that?
*19:13.360- 19:17.880* :  The organization of American states has no credibility in Venezuela. In fact,
*19:17.880- 19:24.380* :  their observer mission was not accepted and people identify the OAS in Venezuela as an
*19:24.380- 19:30.140* :  opposition ally. However, what happened is that around midnight, the electoral authorities in
*19:30.140- 19:34.660* :  Venezuela said that the system was back up, and that is when they released the numbers that
*19:34.660- 19:38.780* :  showed President Maduro as the winner and the opposition in second place.
*19:41.520- 19:48.880* :  Your current president, Gustavo Petro, has called for a transparent vote count. Would you support
*19:51.880- 19:56.160* :  that? Absolutely, but it is important that people know that the Venezuela and electoral system
*19:56.160- 20:02.500* :  works very safely, and I have known this since I was Secretary-General at Unisor. The system has
*20:02.500- 20:09.140* :  a double control on the one hand an electronic vote, and the other hand a manual vote. It is not
*20:09.140- 20:14.020* :  the tallies kept by each party that can give the definitive result to the election, but a recount
*20:14.020- 20:20.840* :  of the electronic votes. Not only President Petro, but also President Lula Brazil is asking for it,
*20:21.440- 20:26.520* :  as well as the United Nations, and us, the international observers, are requesting it.
*20:29.540- 20:36.180* :  How do you persuade Mr. Maduro, though, to undergo that exercise at the moment he is digging
*20:36.180- 20:45.320* :  in his heels and has accused the opposition of trying to mount a coup because they have challenged
*20:45.320- 20:53.600* :  the result? President Maduro knows that there are other very important issues for Venezuela that
*20:53.600- 20:59.680* :  depend on the acceptance of the results, for example, lifting the sanctions. The possibility for
*20:59.680- 21:05.960* :  migrants to return to Venezuela, or if it is finally clear that he was elected, that he will have
*21:05.960- 21:10.960* :  the possibility to be President for six years. I believe that these are very powerful factors,
*21:11.420- 21:15.960* :  and that he must take into account in order to open a space for negotiation with the opposition
*21:15.960- 21:21.440* :  in such a way that the elections are validated. But this problem won't be sorted through force,
*21:22.100- 21:27.700* :  neither through demonstrations or arguments in the media. This problem has to be solved by
*21:27.700- 21:33.080* :  Venezuela's opposition leaders have to sit down with the government. I could witness this in 2016,
*21:33.260- 21:39.200* :  when the Venezuelan government lost the majority in the assembly. And I believe that if there is a
*21:39.200- 21:45.240* :  karma and less polarized environment, then it is possible to think of an agreement of validating the
*21:45.240- 21:55.000* :  results of the election and creating a new national. Colombia's former president, Ernesto Sampa,
*21:55.780- 22:01.220* :  young activists in Nigeria have told BBC News they plan to go ahead with a 10-day protest,
*22:01.220- 22:06.160* :  despite days of pleas from the government to stand down. They say they're rallying against
*22:06.160- 22:11.940* :  economic hardship, but government agencies have warned of violence. The price of food and goods
*22:11.940- 22:16.740* :  in the country has sold to record levels, a Cimigiloso report from Lagos.
*22:20.980- 22:26.880* :  Impassioned activists are distributing flyers across towns in Lagos. They're trying to rally
*22:26.880- 22:32.980* :  support for a protest they are convinced will change their fate. One of them is 36-year-old
*22:32.980- 22:36.820* :  Banwar Al-Aggalcou, an organizer with a take-it-back movement.
*22:50.160- 22:54.740* :  The group is one of a few that wants the government to tackle the cost of living crisis.
*22:54.740- 23:00.840* :  Nigeria's inflation has passed 34 per cent. It's highest in almost three decades.
*23:06.760- 23:11.160* :  The proposed protests have commanded the government's attention with the president holding
*23:11.160- 23:16.500* :  emergency meetings, while the military have warned of an intervention to prevent any violence.
*23:16.500- 23:23.860* :  A caution the group's national coordinator, 31-year-old Duos Anuelu, has dismissed as a smoke screen.
*23:24.180- 23:30.280* :  The protestors have nothing to lose. You know, a man who is down, not to be afraid of falling,
*23:30.940- 23:36.060* :  we are down already. It's so good we have lost our fear. Nigeria's struggling economy is linked
*23:36.060- 23:41.620* :  to the removal of a subsidy on fuel and the de-attaching of the value of the local currency from
*23:41.620- 23:46.520* :  the U.S. dollar. The government said the reforms were necessary to relieve public spending
*23:46.520- 23:52.220* :  and shore up the country's economy. A stark example of the desperation people of feeling
*23:52.220- 23:59.500* :  is a crush in February in which seven people died. Dozens had clambered a government facility in
*23:59.500- 24:05.560* :  Lagos to buy discounted bags of rice that had been seized by officials, but what was labeled a
*24:05.560- 24:12.260* :  gesture of goodwill quickly became a catastrophe. Comfort Adibanger who died was a teacher and mother
*24:12.260- 24:17.940* :  who also took care of her five siblings and elderly mother and father, Chegun Adibanger, who
*24:17.940- 24:24.880* :  was a reverend. It's a great shock to me, my daughter, that is taking care. What we are going to
*24:24.880- 24:28.840* :  eat, what we are going to eat. So I don't even know how to cope with life you get.
*24:29.160- 24:35.320* :  Many are still scarred by the country's last mass demonstration against police brutality in 2020
*24:35.340- 24:41.620* :  in which dozens of protestors were killed and schools arrested, but organizers say history
*24:41.900- 24:47.620* :  will not deter them. I'm not a prophet, as I like to say, but once and I can assure you that
*24:47.620- 24:54.580* :  an engine is a resolute and we will put this. Sui Jolla Oso in Lagos. The BBC has condemned the
*24:54.580- 24:59.820* :  behaviour of one of its best known presenters as Abhorrent after he pleaded guilty to charges
*24:59.820- 25:05.660* :  linked to having indecent images of children. Hugh Edwards left the BBC in April after he'd
*25:05.660- 25:10.520* :  been suspended in relation to different allegations. I found out more from our culture reporter
*25:10.520- 25:17.340* :  Charlotte Gallagher. He has admitted three counts of making indecent images of children.
*25:17.760- 25:24.280* :  Some of those images are Category A and Category A in the United Kingdom is the most severe.
*25:25.040- 25:31.180* :  Some of those images as well, police say they estimate the ages of the child involved to be
*25:31.180- 25:37.660* :  between seven and nine years old, so young children. As you said, Hugh Edwards really was the
*25:37.660- 25:42.460* :  face of BBC News. If you're listening to this and you don't know who he is, imagine the most
*25:42.460- 25:47.780* :  famous news presenter that you know, that will be him. So he announced the death of Queen Elizabeth,
*25:48.660- 25:55.220* :  led the coverage of the coronation. He was on TV all the time. Most people in the UK know who
*25:55.220- 26:00.720* :  Hugh Edwards is. And today when he arrived at court, there was this scrum, police, photographers
*26:00.720- 26:06.640* :  flanking him as he went inside the court in sunglasses. And then this moment inside court,
*26:06.640- 26:13.800* :  when he pled guilty to three really serious offenses, it has shocked so many people,
*26:14.380- 26:19.460* :  not only within the BBC, but across the country. And in the last couple of hours, we've heard a bit
*26:19.460- 26:26.020* :  more from the police about where these images came from. Yes. So the police have said that the man
*26:26.020- 26:31.580* :  who shared these indecent images of children with Hugh Edwards was a convicted pedophile,
*26:31.820- 26:37.740* :  a 25 year old called Alex Williams. He has already pled guilty to possessing and distributing
*26:37.740- 26:43.600* :  category A images of children. And he's been given a suspended jail sentence. He was given that
*26:43.640- 26:49.080* :  in March. And they say that the police began this investigation into Edwards when they seized a
*26:49.080- 26:54.520* :  phone that was unrelated to him, but they found that he'd been talking and had had images on his
*26:54.520- 27:00.060* :  phone. So new information from the Metropolitan Police today. And also we've heard from the BBC,
*27:00.060- 27:06.060* :  like you said, the bosses of the BBC who've said they're incredibly shocked. And in the UK,
*27:06.060- 27:12.600* :  there's some controversy about the fact that until relatively recently, Hugh Edwards was still
*27:12.600- 27:19.200* :  being paid by the BBC using public money, large amounts of money because he still worked for them
*27:19.200- 27:25.500* :  up until a point when he resigned. Yes. So he resigned in April. That was his choice. So he was
*27:25.500- 27:29.780* :  allowed to stand down essentially from his position. And he said he was standing down on medical
*27:30.920- 27:35.360* :  grounds. It's emerged that the BBC knew last November that he'd been arrested for an incredibly
*27:35.360- 27:41.100* :  serious offense, but he hadn't been charged. Now the BBC is saying if he had been charged, he
*27:41.100- 27:45.580* :  would have been sacked. But because he wasn't charged, he was allowed to continue with the BBC.
*27:45.580- 27:50.100* :  He wasn't on air. It's important to say he wasn't broadcasting on television or radio. But between
*27:50.100- 27:54.160* :  that time in November when he was arrested and when he resigned in April, he was still receiving
*27:54.160- 27:59.100* :  his full salary and incredibly high salary. It dwarfs the salaries of most people working here.
*27:59.400- 28:03.700* :  And he was also allowed to decide when he left. So there are the questions the BBC are going
*28:03.700- 28:08.180* :  to have to answer. Why was he still being paid this huge salary? And why was he allowed to decide
*28:08.180- 28:13.720* :  when he left? Our culture reporter, Charlotte Gallagher. Australia has the highest rates of
*28:13.720- 28:18.160* :  food allergies in the world. There's no cure and no routinely available treatment.
*28:18.160- 28:23.260* :  Now it's launching a world first initiative to offer treatment to babies with a peanut
*28:23.260- 28:27.440* :  allergy so they can build immunity to this potentially life-threatening condition.
*28:28.040- 28:32.460* :  Professor Kirsten Perates, the director of the National Energy Centre of Excellence in Australia,
*28:32.820- 28:36.340* :  which is going to evaluate the programme. This new programme called the Adapt
*28:36.340- 28:41.160* :  Oraluminotherapy Programme aims to change the way the most common food allergy among Australian
*28:41.160- 28:46.860* :  school children is treated. That's peanut allergy. From strictly avoiding peanut in the diets,
*28:47.560- 28:53.500* :  to safely building a tolerance to the allotment. So the children will be given a peanut powder
*28:53.980- 28:59.280* :  in a daily dose and that daily dose will start at extremely small amounts and they will be
*28:59.280- 29:05.500* :  supervised initially by the treating hospital with their first dose and then the families will be
*29:05.500- 29:10.240* :  giving a daily dose to that child once a day for another month and then they'll come back to the
*29:10.240- 29:15.580* :  hospital to have another supervised dose, which is slightly higher to what they have had previously.
*29:15.580- 29:20.840* :  So it will be a sequential updosing of the programme until they reach a top dose and they'll
*29:20.840- 29:26.860* :  continue that top what's we call maintenance dose for a two-year period. We're really hoping that
*29:27.560- 29:33.540* :  most children will develop at least some what we call desensitisation. They'll be able to tolerate a
*29:33.540- 29:39.740* :  higher amount of peanut allergy at the end of the treatment to what they were able to tolerate
*29:39.740- 29:44.740* :  at the beginning and that means we're providing at least some bite safety from those accidental
*29:44.780- 29:51.300* :  reactions, accidental and cost contamination that might occur and that provides a level of safety.
*29:51.700- 29:57.100* :  However, for some children we are hoping that there will be that remission achieved and that means
*29:57.100- 30:03.760* :  that after a period of not eating peanut at all they're able to tolerate what's known as a full
*30:03.760- 30:09.020* :  serve of peanut butter and that would be a really game-changing outcome for these children.
*30:09.940- 30:15.680* :  Now researchers have used powerful x-rays to reveal the internal anatomy of a tiny prehistoric
*30:15.680- 30:21.760* :  creature in astonishing detail. The fossil, which is the size of a poppy seed, is an ancient
*30:21.760- 30:27.260* :  ancestor of modern insects. The images have been published in the journal Nature, as our science
*30:27.260- 30:32.980* :  correspondent Victoria Gill explains. This miniscule fossil was essentially picked out of a pile of
*30:32.980- 30:39.500* :  520 million year old grit. The scientists found it inside deposits of ancient rock in northern China
*30:39.500- 30:44.460* :  that are known to contain microscopic fossils and to release them they dissolved the rocks in acid
*30:44.460- 30:48.880* :  and searched the remnants. When they studied this discovery through the microscope they saw that
*30:48.880- 30:54.640* :  it was almost perfectly preserved. It's the larval or immature and developing form of an
*30:54.640- 30:59.980* :  arthropod, the ancient ancestor of modern insects, spiders and crabs. It held more internal
*30:59.980- 31:05.620* :  secrets that were revealed using powerful x-rays. The creature's microscopic anatomy, including parts
*31:05.620- 31:11.640* :  of its digestive tract, nervous system and its brain cavity can be seen in these scans. Dr Martin
*31:11.640- 31:15.900* :  Smith from the University of Durham said this was a glimpse of a critical point in the evolution
*31:15.960- 31:21.660* :  of complex life known as the Cambrian explosion. This fossil, about 520 million years old,
*31:21.660- 31:27.120* :  dates to just after the Cambrian explosion. So if we go back another 30 million years or so,
*31:27.500- 31:31.240* :  there's really no complex animal life at all. And so we've got in really a very short
*31:31.240- 31:38.200* :  space of time, this sort of evolutionary bang from simplicity to complexity. By understanding
*31:38.200- 31:42.240* :  these fossils and what they're telling us, we can start to ask, what is it that meant
*31:42.240- 31:47.240* :  evolution went awire at this particular point in time? The researchers say the incredible
*31:47.240- 31:52.080* :  preservation could have been caused by high concentrations of phosphorus in the ocean where this
*31:52.080- 31:57.620* :  lava briefly lived and died. That material, they say, might have flooded the tissues of this
*31:57.620- 32:03.260* :  poppy seed sized lava, essentially crystallising its tiny body for half a billion years.

*32:41.080- 32:46.080* :  Hi, I'm Simon Jack. And I'm Zingseng. And good bad billionaire is back for a new season now
*32:46.080- 32:50.880* :  from the BBC World Service. Every episode we pick up billionaire and we find out how they made
*32:50.880- 32:55.440* :  their money. And then we judge them, are they good, bad, or just another billionaire.
*32:55.800- 33:00.440* :  So who are some of the people that you'll hear about in season two? The richest comedian ever?
*33:00.440- 33:05.880* :  Jerry Seinfeld's there. There's also my personal favourite story, the fashion designer who was once
*33:05.880- 33:11.180* :  a communist mine. That's Mutu Prada. And the people behind some of the biggest companies on the planet.
*33:11.180- 33:16.960* :  Google TikTok, for example. But we are kicking off with a sporting superstar, Tiger Woods.
