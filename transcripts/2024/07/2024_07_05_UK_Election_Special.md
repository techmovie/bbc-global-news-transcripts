*01:25.260- 01:32.220* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and at four o'clock GMT on Friday, the 5th of July, a seismic change
*01:32.220- 01:33.200* :  in British politics.
*01:33.200- 01:35.640* :  The Labour Party has won a landslide victory.
*01:35.640- 01:40.780* :  The outgoing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has admitted defeat, even though all the results
*01:40.780- 01:41.720* :  are not yet in.
*01:42.280- 01:44.960* :  The British people have delivered a sobering verdict tonight.
*01:45.960- 01:48.000* :  There is much to learn and reflect on.
*01:48.800- 01:50.700* :  And I take responsibility for the loss.
*01:50.960- 01:54.840* :  He's called the leader of the Labour Party Keir Starmer to congratulate him on becoming
*01:54.840- 01:55.880* :  the next Prime Minister.
*01:56.440- 01:59.340* :  Up and down the country, they're ready for change.
*01:59.580- 02:05.640* :  To end the politics of performance, a return to politics as public service.
*02:06.040- 02:10.920* :  Also in this podcast, we'll hear from Australia where a million British people are watching
*02:10.920- 02:11.400* :  the results.
*02:12.080- 02:16.900* :  I'm Katie Watson in Sydney reflecting on how the UK election is being seen down under.
*02:17.320- 02:21.100* :  We'll hear about the growth of right-wing populist parties in Europe.
*02:24.000- 02:28.740* :  As we record this podcast, results from the UK general election are coming in thick and
*02:28.740- 02:32.300* :  fast, and they appear to confirm an earthquake in British politics.
*02:32.420- 02:37.000* :  The governing conservatives who've been in power for 14 years are on course to suffer
*02:37.000- 02:38.420* :  their worst ever result.
*02:38.420- 02:43.820* :  The Conservative leader Rishi Sunak held his seat, but this is what he said just before
*02:43.820- 02:44.880* :  we came into the studio.
*02:45.380- 02:50.120* :  The Labour Party has won this general election, and I've called Sir Keir Starmer to congratulate
*02:50.120- 02:51.340* :  him on his victory.
*02:52.400- 02:57.520* :  Today power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner, with good will on all sides.
*02:58.500- 03:02.580* :  That is something that should give us all confidence in our country's stability and
*03:02.580- 03:03.000* :  future.
*03:03.780- 03:06.420* :  The British people have delivered a sobering verdict tonight.
*03:07.400- 03:12.200* :  There is much to learn and reflect on, and I take responsibility for the loss.
*03:13.200- 03:18.040* :  For the many good, hard-working Conservative candidates who lost tonight, despite their
*03:18.040- 03:23.580* :  tireless efforts, their local records of delivery and their dedication to their communities,
*03:24.520- 03:25.140* :  I am sorry.
*03:26.060- 03:29.700* :  I will now head down to London where I will say more about tonight's result, before
*03:29.700- 03:32.980* :  I leave the job of Prime Minister, to which I have given my all.
*03:33.960- 03:39.040* :  I will then return here to my family's home, and I look forward to spending more time
*03:39.040- 03:42.220* :  with you all in the weeks, months and years ahead.
*03:42.860- 03:43.220* :  Thank you.
*03:43.780- 03:48.760* :  The Opposition Labour Party has made an incredible comeback from five years ago, when it recorded
*03:48.760- 03:51.020* :  its worst defeat since 1935.
*03:51.820- 03:56.120* :  Now the party leader Sir Keir Starmer is on course to be the new Prime Minister, and here
*03:56.120- 03:57.640* :  he is after winning his own seat.
*03:58.100- 04:01.680* :  We have to return politics to public service.
*04:02.720- 04:05.900* :  Show that politics can be a force for good.
*04:06.500- 04:11.240* :  Take no mistake, that is the great test of politics in this era.
*04:12.220- 04:16.600* :  The fight for trust is the battle that defines our age.
*04:17.440- 04:23.360* :  It is why we have campaigned so hard on demonstrating we are fit for public service.
*04:24.260- 04:33.380* :  Service is the precondition for hope, respect the bond that can unite a country together,
*04:34.280- 04:40.460* :  the values of this change Labour Party are the driving principle for a new government.
*04:41.440- 04:43.620* :  Country first, party second.
*04:46.460- 04:51.140* :  In particular, the Conservatives appear to have lost votes to the populist right-wing
*04:51.140- 04:52.660* :  reform UK party.
*04:53.000- 04:57.160* :  That party's leader Nigel Farage won his seat in Clackton in Essex.
*04:57.320- 05:00.240* :  It was Mr Farage's eighth attempt to become an MP.
*05:00.960- 05:07.380* :  My plan is to build a mass national movement over the course of the next few years, and
*05:07.380- 05:13.040* :  hopefully be big enough to challenge the general election properly in 2029.
*05:13.840- 05:19.340* :  What is interesting is, there is no enthusiasm for Labour, there is no enthusiasm for Starmer
*05:20.340- 05:20.540* :  whatsoever.
*05:20.560- 05:25.140* :  In fact, about half of the vote is simply an anti-conservative vote.
*05:25.540- 05:29.300* :  This Labour Government will be in trouble very, very quickly.
*05:30.640- 05:36.820* :  We will now be targeting Labour votes, we are coming for Labour, be in no doubt about
*05:36.820- 05:37.100* :  that.
*05:37.680- 05:45.120* :  Believe me folks, this is just the first step of something that is going to stun all of
*05:45.120- 05:45.260* :  you.
*05:46.000- 05:50.940* :  Our political correspondent is Rob Watson, and he spoke to Oliver Comway about what hit
*05:50.940- 05:52.220* :  taken away from these results.
*05:52.900- 05:57.560* :  So the things that I pick out are that this is not an election that Labour has won, but
*05:57.560- 05:58.780* :  the Conservatives have lost.
*05:58.780- 06:03.920* :  In other words, there is no enthusiasm particularly for Sir Keir Starmer, for the Labour Party, no
*06:03.960- 06:05.160* :  love lost there.
*06:05.780- 06:08.680* :  No major policy differences, really, that decided this.
*06:08.680- 06:11.280* :  This was a, let's get the Conservatives out.
*06:11.840- 06:15.500* :  The other thing that I pick up on, of course, is that part of the Conservatives' problem
*06:15.500- 06:21.220* :  is this leaching, this hemorrhaging of votes, to the populist right, reform party led by
*06:21.220- 06:22.060* :  Nigel Farage.
*06:22.060- 06:26.420* :  We were just hearing from Mr Farage a second ago there, and then something else I'd throw
*06:26.420- 06:30.660* :  in there that's come up is that clearly Labour has a problem with many of its traditional
*06:30.660- 06:35.100* :  Muslim voters who've turned away from the party, and that's produced some odd results.
*06:35.380- 06:36.200* :  But that's where we are.
*06:36.200- 06:41.660* :  We've got this radical reordering of Britain's political landscape, with goodness knows what
*06:41.660- 06:46.200* :  ramifications are going to come, because clearly the Conservatives are going to have to rethink
*06:46.200- 06:48.900* :  that they move to the right, that they become more like reform.
*06:49.400- 06:54.780* :  And we have this Labour Party with a giant majority, but with not much enthusiasm and
*06:54.780- 07:00.600* :  all against this incredible backdrop of apathy, distrust, lack of confidence in politicians
*07:00.700- 07:05.260* :  at reinforced by what's looking like a very, very low turnout.
*07:06.080- 07:10.320* :  You mentioned the Conservatives basically having lost this election, let's just go through
*07:10.320- 07:10.740* :  some names.
*07:10.860- 07:15.940* :  Alex Chalk, Grant Shaps, Gillian Keegan, Penny Mordent, Simon Clark.
*07:15.940- 07:19.140* :  These were very senior politicians in the Conservative Party.
*07:19.260- 07:20.300* :  It's a bloodbuff, right?
*07:20.460- 07:26.540* :  Although the exit poll predictions were now thinking that perhaps it's not quite as bad,
*07:26.540- 07:31.720* :  when I say not quite, it still looks like being the worst Conservative performance in
*07:31.720- 07:34.600* :  200 years, the entire modern history of the party.
*07:35.140- 07:39.700* :  So it's no surprise that there's been an absolutely bloodbath of its senior figures,
*07:39.700- 07:45.660* :  and of course the inquest, the bloodletting has already started with many senior Conservatives,
*07:45.660- 07:49.920* :  both those who've lost their seats and those who are still there saying, we have let the
*07:49.960- 07:52.300* :  people down, we need a period of soul searching.
*07:52.800- 07:56.460* :  The question is, of course, what direction do the Conservative Party go in?
*07:56.720- 07:59.600* :  You mentioned some slightly odd results for the Labour Party.
*07:59.600- 08:05.480* :  Fagnam Devonair has lost to the Green Party leader, Khaled Denier, Jonathan Ashworth, also
*08:05.480- 08:10.220* :  another big figure has lost, and at the same time they're going to be squeezed by reform
*08:10.280- 08:16.500* :  and it all underlines the challenge facing Sir Kirstama as he takes up his office as
*08:16.500- 08:17.120* :  Prime Minister.
*08:17.620- 08:23.040* :  Yes, and it's a reminder of the political turbulence out there, I mean, to go from five
*08:23.040- 08:30.160* :  years ago the Conservatives with an ATC majority with Boris Johnson regarded as this great colossus
*08:30.160- 08:35.300* :  to suddenly now looking at perhaps a Labour majority of 170, I mean, what an extraordinary
*08:35.780- 08:35.820* :  turnaround.
*08:36.380- 08:40.480* :  And it's a reminder of the volatility in British politics, and you can't help thinking
*08:40.480- 08:45.160* :  that unless Sir Kirstama and Labour are able to address what's probably underlying this
*08:45.160- 08:50.680* :  volatility, and I think the evidence suggests what that is, is economic stagnation, unless
*08:50.680- 08:54.900* :  you can get economic growth, unless you can start to get Britain's public services functioning,
*08:55.460- 08:59.840* :  and something else as well, which I think is fueling the popularity of reform.
*09:00.340- 09:05.080* :  And that is to make the case or to decide what Britain wants to do about very high levels
*09:05.080- 09:11.520* :  of net migration, to either reduce net migration or to make the case to British people about
*09:11.520- 09:14.460* :  why large numbers of immigrants are needed.
*09:14.920- 09:19.860* :  And I think unless the evidence suggests that less Kirstama can do that, maybe, you
*09:19.860- 09:23.080* :  know, who knows in five years time we could say, goodness gracious, there's been a great
*09:23.080- 09:24.940* :  swing back to the Conservatives or a form.
*09:25.260- 09:29.720* :  I mean, in this climate of turbulence that we've seen really since the Brexit referendum
*09:29.720- 09:32.700* :  in 2016, you've got to say anything could happen.
*09:33.060- 09:37.340* :  On the surface of turbulence, let's look at the third party or which was the third party
*09:37.340- 09:42.860* :  of the Liberal Democrats. They did appallingly in 2015, after being in coalition, now it
*09:42.860- 09:44.140* :  looks like they're back to where they were.
*09:45.160- 09:50.500* :  Yes, and again, it's really about the two fingers up to the Conservatives because the
*09:50.500- 09:54.980* :  seats where they've done well, where they were second to the Conservatives in place where
*09:54.980- 10:00.880* :  normally Conservatives send MPs, decades and decades and decades, but again, it's a
*10:00.900- 10:04.580* :  mark of the unpopularity of the Conservatives.
*10:04.580- 10:08.160* :  It's that anti incumbent, anti politics mood.
*10:08.780- 10:13.080* :  That was Rob Watson. Now let's hear what the picture is in Scotland, where the main battle
*10:13.080- 10:16.660* :  is between Labour and the Scottish National Party, which wants independence.
*10:17.040- 10:22.700* :  57 seats were up for grabs out of 650 at Westminster and after a decade of dominance,
*10:22.700- 10:27.800* :  the SMP is in trouble. The newsroom's Valerie Sanderson is there and she spoke to Oliver
*10:28.760- 10:33.860* :  Well, Ollie, it's a very windy night here in Glasgow tonight and the winds of change
*10:33.860- 10:36.800* :  are gusting through Scottish politics too.
*10:37.280- 10:41.780* :  South of the border, you're seeing a political earthquake, but if the exit polls are correct,
*10:42.280- 10:43.340* :  it's happening here too.
*10:43.680- 10:50.660* :  Now the predictions are disastrous defeat for the SMP down from 48 to just 10 seats. That
*10:50.660- 10:56.440* :  goes hand in hand with what would be a remarkable comeback for the Labour Party, giving it
*10:56.440- 11:00.720* :  a win at an election in Scotland for the first time in 14 years.
*11:01.140- 11:06.880* :  Or following the last general election in 2019, the sole Labour MP cut a lonely figure
*11:06.880- 11:12.200* :  at Westminster. He's expected of lots of company now. Well, we've had results coming
*11:12.200- 11:19.520* :  in, three seats, all Labour gains from the SMP. So what's behind this swing to Labour
*11:19.520- 11:24.900* :  in Scotland? Well, here's the view of the former SMP leader at Westminster, Angus Robertson.
*11:25.600- 11:32.820* :  I think the public has just been so sick of Conservative UK governments that they have
*11:32.820- 11:38.480* :  wanted them out. And I think the Labour message of vote Labour, vote care starmer for change,
*11:39.240- 11:44.320* :  change message chimed. We know that's a very powerful message. And of course, I'm disappointed.
*11:44.320- 11:48.200* :  I was the leader of the SMP in the House of Commons for 10 years, so that's a lot of my
*11:48.200- 11:54.300* :  colleagues who it looks like will not be holding their seats. And that is obviously disappointing.
*11:55.880- 12:01.160* :  Well, other said it was a judgment on the SMP's last 17 years in power here in Scotland.
*12:01.180- 12:06.800* :  And talking to people in Glasgow today, or rather yesterday, they said they were very
*12:06.800- 12:12.300* :  unhappy at the state of the health service, education and transport all run by the SMP
*12:12.420- 12:17.400* :  who have devolved powers, of course, at the Hollywood Parliament in Edinburgh.
*12:18.100- 12:22.860* :  But the raison d'etre of the SMP is independent. So how important was that in the vote?
*12:23.320- 12:28.820* :  Well, interestingly, Ollie, it wasn't top of the agenda here, although the SMP put it
*12:28.820- 12:35.720* :  foremost in their manifesto. Now, Labour back a united kingdom and do not want a second
*12:35.720- 12:42.440* :  referendum on independence. And it could be that voters have just parked this issue in this
*12:42.440- 12:50.760* :  election because support for independence has not dropped below 45% in polls. But it is an
*12:50.760- 12:56.920* :  issue that is not going away. The former Labour Prime Minister and Scott Gordon Brown says his
*12:56.920- 13:03.860* :  party must work to keep Scotland within the UK because he says the forces pulling Britain apart
*13:03.860- 13:08.900* :  are greater than the forces holding it together unless something is done.
*13:09.300- 13:15.700* :  I was Valerie Sanderson. A standout feature of British politics is the brutal swiftness with which
*13:15.700- 13:21.140* :  a defeated leader is removed. Pretty much as soon as the final constituency results come through,
*13:21.140- 13:26.580* :  secure will be whisked into Downing Street and Rishi Sunak will already have packed his bags
*13:26.580- 13:32.080* :  and moved out. Our political correspondent is Ben Wright. You often have a sense of the removal
*13:32.080- 13:37.980* :  of and wasting around the corner. The ejection from office in the UK for a losing Prime Minister
*13:37.980- 13:46.180* :  is swift and brutal. But it is a well-rehearsed choreography that happens. You get the Prime Minister
*13:46.180- 13:52.440* :  out. They go off to hinder the resignation to the palace, kiss the monarch's hands. Very swiftly,
*13:52.440- 13:57.500* :  the winning the new Prime Minister will come into Downing Street and make a speech often around
*13:57.500- 14:04.520* :  lunchtime on the Friday. So very soon really after winning the election and his staff and team are
*14:04.520- 14:10.360* :  already moving in and then over the course of Friday Saturday there's a complete turnaround
*14:10.360- 14:15.980* :  of staff personnel. It's very different for instance to the United States where following a
*14:15.980- 14:21.080* :  presidential election you have what two months of a transition period. In the UK happens very quickly
*14:21.080- 14:25.780* :  and if there we do have a new Prime Minister later, we expect them to have appointed their
*14:25.780- 14:33.240* :  full cabinet by the end of Friday. You say a complete turnaround. There is one very popular member
*14:33.380- 14:40.840* :  of the British political establishment who will be seeing his 6th Prime Minister possibly at Larry
*14:40.840- 14:47.100* :  the Cat who has already seen five Prime Ministers. Do we have any idea how he is likely to get on
*14:47.100- 14:54.420* :  during all this cuffuffle? I think he's about 17, 18 years old now. Larry the Cat is a tabby.
*14:55.200- 15:00.720* :  It was David Cameron who first let Larry into number 10 and he became number 10's Cat.
*15:01.620- 15:07.540* :  Yeah, in what has been an extraordinarily turbulent, tumultuous period of British politics.
*15:07.580- 15:14.120* :  There is one great survivor, one furry continuity throughout the whole thing and that is Larry
*15:14.120- 15:19.820* :  the Cat. And that was Ben Wright. Now one of the key elements of the UK general election campaign
*15:19.820- 15:26.100* :  has been the growing prominence of the right wing reform UK party. Its leader is Nigel Farage and
*15:26.100- 15:31.920* :  he has won a seat in Parliament. So how much is the emergence of this new right wing populist
*15:31.920- 15:36.320* :  party part of a pattern? The far right has won elections in Italy and the Netherlands,
*15:36.320- 15:41.660* :  leads the polls in France, Austria and Belgium and has a stake in the governments of Finland
*15:41.660- 15:49.140* :  and Slovakia. Mark Lohin is our correspondent in Rome. I think they united partly by a rejection of
*15:49.140- 15:56.140* :  the old established political mainstream. A lot of people have gone to the far right when they
*15:56.140- 16:01.600* :  have been frankly disappointed and disillusioned by established centre left parties or indeed by
*16:01.600- 16:07.140* :  the established centre right. There's partly of course immigration which is a key concern that
*16:07.140- 16:13.000* :  is promoted by far right parties. And then also there's just a kind of general promotion of
*16:13.000- 16:19.580* :  country first. So you know there is that kind of nationalism which is evoked in the rhetoric of
*16:19.580- 16:24.340* :  these far right parties which is again one of the things that unite them. And are the issues then
*16:24.340- 16:30.880* :  that galvanise Georgia Milonies supporters or hit builders supporters the same as the ones that
*16:30.880- 16:38.040* :  got reform UK supporters out? Partly yes because it's things like immigration where reform UK has
*16:38.040- 16:42.460* :  done well in parts of the country where the voters say that immigration is near the top of their
*16:42.460- 16:49.560* :  concerns. But I think what perhaps differs the reform vote from others is that in some countries
*16:49.560- 16:54.280* :  like France where the far right does very well there is a very high youth unemployment factor
*16:54.520- 16:59.400* :  where the far right puts jobs for young people at the top of their agenda. It's also the case in
*16:59.400- 17:04.740* :  Italy which has got an enormous problem of youth unemployment. I didn't see youth unemployment
*17:04.740- 17:10.320* :  particularly at the top of Nigel Farage's agenda. He was more talking about immigration, more
*17:10.320- 17:16.500* :  talking about sovereignty. I think what's very interesting in France at the moment is that the
*17:16.500- 17:22.740* :  National Rally the far right party there has a huge support from young people. Now that is actually
*17:22.740- 17:28.560* :  very different to for example the youth vote in in Britain overwhelmingly is towards the left
*17:29.080- 17:34.260* :  in Germany it's overwhelmingly towards the Greens and the left. So I think France is a little bit
*17:34.260- 17:38.200* :  of an outlier on that and it's the National Rally would not be in the position that it is now
*17:38.260- 17:45.080* :  without a very strong showing among youth voters. How do you see the UK's relationship
*17:45.820- 17:52.380* :  with Europe unfolding under a new government? In terms of Britain's relationship with the rest
*17:52.460- 17:59.980* :  of Europe, how would a Labour government, a centre left government deal with far right
*17:59.980- 18:06.300* :  governments in other parts of Europe? Britain now is looking like a bit of an outlier actually
*18:06.300- 18:11.200* :  and I think that it's going to be very interesting to see the relationship because even though
*18:11.720- 18:16.060* :  Kistarma may not share the political values of some of these far right parties in Europe,
*18:16.960- 18:20.540* :  he also wants to rebuild the relationship between Britain and the European Union and countries
*18:20.540- 18:24.860* :  like Italy and France are obviously at the centre of the European Union and so even though he might
*18:24.860- 18:30.240* :  not share their politics he will want to be seen to be getting on well with the leaders in Rome
*18:30.240- 18:35.220* :  and Paris and Berlin and Madrid and elsewhere. So yeah it's going to be very very interesting
*18:36.200- 18:41.080* :  now we have received some emails about the way we talk about these parties the far right hard
*18:41.080- 18:46.840* :  right radical right and suggesting that there are no left wing equivalents. So is it difficult
*18:46.840- 18:52.420* :  for us to talk about them in a balanced way? Another question for Marklone? I think we have to be
*18:52.420- 18:58.980* :  confident in the labels that we use. For example when I worked on the rise of Georgia Maloney we talked
*18:58.980- 19:03.900* :  about her as far right but her party I mean her party officials were speaking to me saying we're
*19:03.900- 19:08.980* :  not far right you are wrong and call us far right. Marine Le Pen has also rejected that in France
*19:08.980- 19:14.440* :  because I think that they feel that that taints them as something that they feel they're not
*19:15.020- 19:21.340* :  but you have to look at the values that they promote and indeed their historical roots the
*19:21.340- 19:26.900* :  all these leaders have tried to detoxify their parties and to make them more mainstream but they all
*19:26.900- 19:33.680* :  in a sense share an evocation of nationalism language that occasionally borders on the racist
*19:34.380- 19:39.800* :  so the language often defines them as far right. I was thinking in a nutshell there is a left wing
*19:39.800- 19:46.240* :  a right wing a center and there is a far right now is there a far left yes in France there is a far
*19:46.240- 19:50.720* :  left the France on bad party but I would say there are more far right parties in Europe than
*19:50.720- 19:54.820* :  far left and also the far right is doing significantly better than far left so that is why they're perhaps
*19:54.820- 20:00.560* :  more in the political discourse at the moment. That was Marklone. Now social media feeds across
*20:00.560- 20:06.480* :  the UK have been flooded with political content throughout the campaign period many are legitimate
*20:06.480- 20:12.760* :  and accurate are those false and misleading but what impact has it had? The BBC's disinformation
*20:12.760- 20:19.140* :  and social media correspondent Mariana Spring has been looking at tactics she spotted on the social
*20:19.140- 20:25.060* :  media feeds of undercover voter accounts that she created fictional characters reflecting views
*20:25.060- 20:30.580* :  from across the UK political spectrum and she spoke to all of a con way. One thing that's been really
*20:30.580- 20:34.820* :  interesting throughout the course of this general election campaign has been the kind of battle
*20:34.820- 20:39.760* :  between paid for political content and then what we would call organic content stuff that
*20:40.080- 20:43.980* :  is not paid for in the same way you don't pay to target it but it can be recommended to people on
*20:43.980- 20:49.100* :  their feeds and it can come from the parties themselves and there's been a real shift compared to
*20:49.400- 20:54.420* :  the 2019 general election here in the UK because TikTok is a thing in a way that it wasn't before
*20:54.920- 20:59.880* :  and the reason that matters is not necessarily because everybody's using TikTok although a lot
*20:59.880- 21:05.500* :  of people are but it's because the way that TikTok works so it's for you page is basically about
*21:05.500- 21:10.780* :  content from random users or from other people often people you don't know being recommended to you.
*21:11.120- 21:15.040* :  A lot of the content that's performed particularly well from the parties has been the stuff that is
*21:15.320- 21:20.320* :  organic rather than paid for you know a candidate talking to camera or a meme that really plays into
*21:20.320- 21:24.960* :  an existing trend that has tended to get a lot of engagement and a lot of reaction. What this
*21:24.960- 21:29.440* :  also means is that content that comes not from the parties at all but from what I've like to call
*21:29.440- 21:34.940* :  the kind of accidental social media influencers succeeds in reaching just as many people as a lot
*21:34.940- 21:39.020* :  of the parties posts and certainly more than some of the ads which means basically you don't need to
*21:39.020- 21:43.740* :  spend as much money on ads perhaps as some of the campaigns have. Did any of the parties surprise you
*21:43.740- 21:49.420* :  in terms of how they use social media? I read that reform were getting lots of younger viewers on
*21:49.420- 21:54.420* :  TikTok. Labor in particular quite early on started posting some really funny stuff on TikTok that
*21:54.420- 22:00.080* :  got a lot of attention particularly about a pledge to reintroduce national service from Rishi Sunak.
*22:00.560- 22:05.700* :  When it comes to reform UK and some of the smaller parties too their spend on ads is a lot less than
*22:05.700- 22:10.380* :  certainly than labor and the conservatives too kind of second to that. So reform is like the other
*22:10.380- 22:15.380* :  parties not spent as much money on paid for ads but if you look at for example their engagement
*22:15.380- 22:19.780* :  interaction on TikTok and on other sites they've had a lot of views and a lot of likes.
*22:20.420- 22:25.600* :  Those views don't necessarily translate into like right if it's had one million views it means one
*22:25.600- 22:28.580* :  million people who convert in the election have seen it some of them won't be old enough to vote
*22:28.580- 22:32.140* :  some of them won't even be based in the UK but I think it does tell you about that kind of
*22:32.580- 22:38.780* :  lively organic conversation. Has there been any evidence of interference from other countries say
*22:38.780- 22:44.280* :  Russia or any other country? I've identified quite a lot of suspect accounts who've been posting
*22:44.280- 22:48.800* :  the same message who've been posting divisive content accounts that otherwise do seem inauthentic
*22:48.960- 22:52.920* :  but I actually try to answer that question of who is behind them is very difficult and I think we
*22:52.920- 22:58.500* :  have to be really careful about that when it comes to interference and operations the countries
*22:58.500- 23:02.580* :  that are accused of doing them would love us to believe they are having more of an impact perhaps
*23:02.580- 23:05.740* :  than they've actually had. There's every chance that some of these accounts could be linked to
*23:06.040- 23:10.220* :  for an influence of some kind but there's also every chance they could be run by groups of supporters
*23:10.660- 23:15.320* :  or people who are looking for engagement as well. That was Marianna Spring. Now despite being on
*23:15.320- 23:21.220* :  the opposite sides of the world a Britain and Australia have a pretty close relationship more than
*23:21.220- 23:26.540* :  a million British people live down under so are they interested in the outcome of the election back
*23:26.540- 23:32.280* :  home? Our correspondent in Sydney Katie Watson also spoke to Oliver Conway. Well as you mentioned
*23:32.280- 23:38.160* :  that Australia is home to the largest number of rits outside the UK so there's big interest in
*23:38.160- 23:43.720* :  what's going on back home among brits but also Australians are paying attention to these
*23:43.720- 23:48.720* :  elections. Australia in the last few years has seen a huge number of Prime Ministers coming
*23:48.720- 23:53.660* :  through and they're looking at similarities to what we've seen in the UK. Professor Mark Kenney
*23:53.660- 23:58.180* :  is the director of the Australian Studies Institute at the Australian National University in Canberra
*23:58.180- 24:03.120* :  and he hosts a podcast called Democracy's Susage and he says it's an interesting political shift
*24:03.500- 24:08.020* :  but it's confident that Australia UK relations will stay strong. I think the fact that
*24:08.020- 24:13.940* :  there's going to be a significant change to a very mainstream and centrist-starmer government
*24:13.940- 24:18.580* :  by the look of it doesn't pose any great threat so there's no downside risk to the Australian
*24:18.580- 24:24.760* :  British bilateral relationship but nonetheless we do take a great deal of interest and I guess
*24:24.860- 24:30.340* :  there could be quite dramatic developments on the right end of the spectrum with Frager's
*24:30.340- 24:35.520* :  reform party that will be interesting and some of these political trends do tend to play out
*24:35.520- 24:41.340* :  in other policies and will take some interest in that as well. Mark Kenney of the Democracy Susage
*24:41.340- 24:48.160* :  podcast and Katie how will the relationship between the UK and Australia change if as expected
*24:48.160- 24:53.960* :  Keir Starmer does become a Labour Prime Minister? Well it's a relationship with a lot of history of
*24:54.060- 25:00.180* :  course. When I speak to people about the relationship many point to Orcas as being crucial to that
*25:00.180- 25:05.960* :  that's the trilateral defence pact between the UK the US and Australia that will build nuclear
*25:05.960- 25:10.960* :  submarines for Australia and it's a deal that not only creates thousands of jobs in the UK but the
*25:10.960- 25:16.800* :  idea is effectively coming together in the face of China China's a big topic here in Australia
*25:16.800- 25:22.560* :  with geopolitical shifts in the Pacific. Now Mike Todd is the chairman of conservatives abroad
*25:22.560- 25:28.080* :  in Australia and he says relations between the two countries will continue to grow no matter
*25:28.080- 25:34.340* :  who's in power in the UK. I think that the relationship will always remain strong this is
*25:34.340- 25:40.480* :  culturally very close to the UK being in Australia I think the Orcas deal has strengthened that
*25:40.480- 25:45.700* :  over the last few years and I think it will continue to strengthen it regardless of which
*25:45.700- 25:51.500* :  political power gets in I think that the relationship is now in a very good place and I think
*25:51.500- 25:56.020* :  it will continue to grow and I hope it does I think there's such a lot that our two great
*25:56.020- 26:02.400* :  nation share and we should be sharing a lot more to build those resiliances and those partnerships
*26:02.400- 26:08.760* :  that will be so desperately needed as the next few decades unravel. So that was Mike Todd from
*26:08.760- 26:12.740* :  the chairman of conservatives abroad all eyes hear certainly from the Brits in Australia
*26:13.160- 26:18.180* :  on the results coming out from the UK. That was Katie Watson and it's not just Australians who
*26:18.180- 26:22.660* :  are following the British election we will end this election special edition of the Global News
*26:22.660- 26:26.420* :  Podcast by looking at what the papers are on the world are saying here's Anna Murphy.
*26:27.020- 26:30.640* :  So I've been scanning the headlines coming in from papers across the world and the
*26:30.640- 26:34.760* :  world I've seen the most times is as you've probably guessed a landslide. The New York Times
*26:34.760- 26:40.000* :  describes the predicted labour win as a decisive end 14 years of Tory rule and it's been interesting
*26:40.000- 26:45.300* :  to see the variety of ways their landslide can be translated. Le Monde neuro news have been
*26:45.300- 26:50.680* :  leading with large mental debt or large malvanque whilst La Nassie on paper in Chile goes with
*26:50.680- 26:55.360* :  Alpardino Lavalista Arasa in Alexio Ennis meaning the party swept through the elections.
*26:56.020- 27:00.040* :  There's also been a lot of focus on the fact that a labour victory hasn't happened in the UK for
*27:00.040- 27:05.780* :  a long time. Russian independent media outlet Medusa's headline says labour party wins UK parliamentary
*27:05.780- 27:10.680* :  election for POV's ad deviad nadsad liet meaning for the first time in 19 years.
*27:11.960- 27:15.860* :  Now if we go to the New Zealand heralds headline it describes a conservative defeat as the
*27:15.860- 27:20.340* :  worst since World War II but the Italian press took that even further with the headline of La
*27:20.340- 27:25.140* :  Republika stating that the conservatives my gozi mali they've never done so badly.
*27:26.020- 27:29.940* :  And if we go to the Sydney Morning herald it goes straight in with crushing to describe the
*27:29.940- 27:34.900* :  conservative defeat and finally coming back to the UK the sun highlights labour leader Kier
*27:34.900- 27:40.040* :  Starmer's success with the headline reading Kier there and everywhere. That was Anna Murphy.
*27:42.280- 27:47.380* :  And that's it from us from this bonus general election special edition but there will be

*28:35.680- 28:39.580* :  Why don't more infant formula companies have their own factories instead of outsourcing
*28:39.580- 28:45.360* :  their manufacturing? We wondered the same thing so we made by heart a better formula for formula
