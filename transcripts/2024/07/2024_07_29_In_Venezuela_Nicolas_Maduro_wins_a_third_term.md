*01:35.040- 01:39.160* :  They look like worms but we think that those things were probably like slimeballs.

*02:04.040- 02:08.140* :  Robert Downey Jr. makes a shock return to Marvel in a new role.
*02:12.800- 02:17.480* :  There are serious concerns about Sunday's election in Venezuela after the long time President
*02:17.480- 02:19.660* :  Nicholas Maduro was declared the victor.
*02:20.040- 02:24.900* :  Despite opinion polls before the vote showing him trailing far behind the opposition candidate
*02:24.900- 02:30.080* :  Edmondo Gonzales, one after the other a host of countries from the Americas, including
*02:30.080- 02:34.480* :  the U.S., have expressed their disbelief and concern over the results.
*02:35.000- 02:39.220* :  And the opposition has announced the outcome saying that Mr. Gonzales had in fact won
*02:39.220- 02:43.360* :  around three quarters of the vote and he is now the president-elect.
*02:43.820- 02:46.820* :  Small he is our South America correspondent Ioni Wells.
*02:52.000- 02:54.000* :  There must be respect for the popular will.
*02:54.520- 02:58.560* :  Which country in the world after receiving 930 criminal sanctions?
*02:59.080- 03:02.660* :  After having suffered what we have suffered, theirs to call elections.
*03:03.660- 03:04.400* :  We called them.
*03:04.660- 03:09.160* :  They were carried out in an exemplary manner and I can say before the people of Venezuela
*03:09.160- 03:10.400* :  and before the world.
*03:13.880- 03:19.040* :  President Maduro claiming victory for a third time, asking people to respect the will of
*03:19.040- 03:19.460* :  the people.
*03:20.180- 03:22.840* :  The question the opposition are asking is, has he?
*03:25.360- 03:30.720* :  Freedom, freedom, emotional cries as the polls closed at one polling station in Caracas
*03:31.420- 03:33.920* :  and in an election where many were voting for change.
*03:35.320- 03:39.980* :  Today the people of Venezuela are determining that these people live power immediately.
*03:40.500- 03:42.820* :  That is being outraged after outrage.
*03:42.820- 03:48.400* :  Violation of human rights as judicial executions, excessive emigration.
*03:49.000- 03:52.660* :  The largest emigration in Latin America without having had a war.
*03:54.900- 03:56.660* :  I want a change for my country.
*03:57.140- 03:59.880* :  I want decent salaries for teachers and doctors.
*03:59.960- 04:06.080* :  A quality of life for the elderly, for our youth, a change for our country with the
*04:06.140- 04:06.680* :  servit.
*04:06.900- 04:10.260* :  It has to be fair because the people are already tired.
*04:10.740- 04:13.760* :  That is why we are all here waiting for a change.
*04:14.000- 04:16.800* :  We hope that the justice is done.
*04:20.560- 04:22.420* :  They wanted a change from President Maduro.
*04:22.960- 04:27.280* :  His party has been in power for decades and he still has some loyal supporters.
*04:30.400- 04:34.160* :  There are many things the benefits help for people like me with disabilities.
*04:34.940- 04:39.240* :  There are many things that we have to take advantage of that no other government has given.
*04:39.740- 04:42.580* :  President Chavez, Maduro and no one else.
*04:48.820- 04:53.920* :  The last election when was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair and again there are
*04:53.920- 04:55.700* :  questions, was this one?
*04:57.020- 04:59.920* :  The president's face blind every street during the campaign.
*05:04.300- 05:08.860* :  There were protests and clashes with authorities after some polling stations didn't open at
*05:08.860- 05:09.080* :  all.
*05:12.600- 05:17.660* :  There were huge queues of people waiting to vote but some delays by design with very few
*05:17.660- 05:19.020* :  people let in at a time.
*05:21.660- 05:25.920* :  At rallies for the president, buses were paid for free food handed out.
*05:33.000- 05:36.400* :  The opposition leader, Maria Carina Machado, was banned from running.
*05:36.860- 05:38.140* :  Many of her aides were detained.
*05:38.940- 05:40.760* :  Shops that served her were closed down.
*05:41.460- 05:45.600* :  She and the opposition have alleged fraud in the counting of votes, saying many of their
*05:45.600- 05:48.240* :  observers were not allowed into election counts.
*05:52.920- 05:57.720* :  Today we want to tell Venezuelans and the entire world that Venezuela has a new president
*05:57.720- 06:00.300* :  elect and aides at Mundo Gonzales.
*06:00.680- 06:02.940* :  We want and everyone knows it.
*06:03.520- 06:05.360* :  We have a one in all sectors.
*06:05.840- 06:07.360* :  We saw it in the streets.
*06:08.040- 06:09.920* :  The regime knows what happened.
*06:10.700- 06:16.440* :  In the next few days we will announce the actions to defend the truth, long life free
*06:16.440- 06:16.980* :  Venezuela.
*06:21.320- 06:22.680* :  Much was at stake in this election.
*06:22.680- 06:27.580* :  The economy has been in freefall for more than a decade, more than half the country lives
*06:27.580- 06:28.100* :  in poverty.
*06:28.820- 06:34.040* :  Millions of Venezuelans have fled the country, many to the U.S. fueling a migration crisis.
*06:34.640- 06:37.120* :  The question now is whether any of that will change.
*06:40.300- 06:45.540* :  That report by only Wells, but what does the main opposition leader Maria Carina Machado
*06:45.540- 06:48.540* :  mean when she says that action will be decided in the next few days?
*06:49.420- 06:54.120* :  Mass protests, a tactic that has been tried before after previous elections and failed.
*06:54.120- 06:57.240* :  Here are America's online editor, Vanessa Bishlutta.
*06:58.080- 07:03.300* :  It was expected by many, but the opposition had hoped it would be a different result.
*07:03.340- 07:10.040* :  They had hoped that if enough people turned out, and many, many people did turn out to vote
*07:10.040- 07:15.780* :  against Mr. Maduro, that that would shield the result from fraud.
*07:16.180- 07:19.920* :  But this outcome looks like the one that many had predicted.
*07:20.560- 07:26.560* :  Of course there will be a huge sense of anger among many, but protesting in Venezuela comes
*07:26.560- 07:27.920* :  with real risks.
*07:28.500- 07:34.380* :  I remember speaking to one family in 2017, their son had taken part in protests and he
*07:34.380- 07:36.560* :  was killed by the Bolivarian Guard.
*07:36.560- 07:38.300* :  So real risks there.
*07:39.360- 07:40.540* :  Vanessa Bishlutta.
*07:41.320- 07:45.420* :  Fiber optic cables have been vandalised across France, causing some outages.
*07:45.700- 07:49.860* :  This comes three days after the French railway network was sabotaged just hours before
*07:49.860- 07:54.540* :  the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics, causing disruption to the travel plans of hundreds
*07:54.540- 07:58.760* :  of thousands of people, many of whom were either trying to get to the games or to get
*07:58.760- 07:59.980* :  away for their summer holidays.
*08:00.660- 08:05.980* :  At the same time, a man described as a far left activist by French police has been detained
*08:05.980- 08:10.720* :  in northern France on suspicion of planning to vandalise railway infrastructure.
*08:11.400- 08:15.140* :  David Chazan in Paris told us more about this latest sabotage attempt in France.
*08:16.000- 08:22.180* :  Fiber optic cables were cut, and this has affected mobile and internet services in different
*08:22.180- 08:28.380* :  parts of France, areas separated from each other by hundreds of kilometres.
*08:28.380- 08:35.180* :  So this has happened in the north of the country, in the east, and also near Paris.
*08:35.960- 08:42.620* :  Now, no group has claimed the acts of or apparent acts of sabotage, but French media have
*08:42.620- 08:47.600* :  been quoting police sources as saying they believe that they were probably coordinated,
*08:48.400- 08:53.360* :  partly because of the long distances between the sites targeted.
*08:54.080- 08:59.800* :  Relatively few people have had their internet or mobile phone services cut because of the
*08:59.800- 09:07.060* :  damage, but services have been considerably slowed because the operators say that data
*09:07.520- 09:11.140* :  has had to be re-routed over longer distances.
*09:11.920- 09:17.460* :  Now the French authorities suspect that these acts are in protest against the Paris Olympics,
*09:18.280- 09:23.760* :  which are in their third day now, but there's no proof of that for the time being.
*09:24.340- 09:29.980* :  Even at the same time, an arrest has been made in northern France as police continue to
*09:29.980- 09:33.040* :  investigate Friday's rail network sabotage.
*09:34.100- 09:34.640* :  That's right.
*09:34.820- 09:37.640* :  A 28-year-old man has been detained.
*09:38.340- 09:44.920* :  He's been described by police as a far-left activist known to have previously trespassed
*09:44.960- 09:46.440* :  on railway property.
*09:47.300- 09:53.960* :  Keys giving access to railway property were found in his car, along with tools which the
*09:53.960- 09:57.380* :  police said could be used for acts of vandalism.
*09:58.000- 10:04.700* :  However, there's no indication that the man detained is linked with the sabotage of communications
*10:04.700- 10:13.000* :  cables and signal boxes on France's high-speed train network on Friday, which happened just
*10:13.100- 10:15.600* :  hours before the Olympics opened.
*10:16.460- 10:24.480* :  But the Interior Minister, Jihad del Maner, says that suspicions are growing that far-left
*10:24.480- 10:30.940* :  activists were to blame for the sabotage and the vandalism on Friday, mainly because
*10:30.940- 10:37.460* :  of their modus operandi, and because far-left groups have attacked rail infrastructure
*10:37.460- 10:39.240* :  in the past in France.
*10:40.380- 10:44.820* :  David Chazan, if you walk down a street in Turkey, you're likely to spot a straight
*10:44.860- 10:45.100* :  dog.
*10:45.660- 10:49.360* :  It's been a neighborhood fixture there for centuries, but that may be about to change.
*10:50.220- 10:55.500* :  Parliament is debating a controversial law that could lead to a mass culling of the animals,
*10:56.100- 10:57.240* :  Anna Aslam reports.
*10:58.200- 11:02.080* :  Millions of dogs roam the streets of Turkey, which the government says is a problem.
*11:02.720- 11:07.480* :  A new law would allow the killing of stray dogs that aren't adopted within 30 days, and
*11:07.480- 11:10.280* :  those who are sick or deemed to display negative behavior.
*11:10.820- 11:13.880* :  The fine for abandoning pets would also rise 30-fold.
*11:14.540- 11:19.120* :  And Urduan says it's necessary to control the population of stray dogs that he says
*11:19.120- 11:23.720* :  have become a menace to society, attacking people, causing accidents and spreading disease.
*11:24.420- 11:28.640* :  But the legislation has sparked nationwide anger and emotive arguments in Parliament.
*11:29.220- 11:34.780* :  MPs were seen jostling one another and exchanging insults, opening another deep divide in an
*11:34.780- 11:36.660* :  already fractured political landscape.
*11:37.380- 11:41.520* :  Some local authorities have said they won't apply the law even if it's passed, and animal
*11:41.520- 11:46.800* :  rights activists have described it as inhumane, calling instead for sterilization programs.
*11:47.640- 11:52.340* :  A recent opinion poll shows nearly 80 percent of the public supports measures to take dogs
*11:52.340- 11:57.400* :  off the street, but less than 3 percent believe collected dogs should be euthanized.
*11:58.960- 12:03.060* :  People could be as well-intentioned as they want, but this law has loopholes.
*12:03.540- 12:06.400* :  The gaps need to be filled before it's put into practice.
*12:08.220- 12:10.060* :  Those who govern us should know this well.
*12:10.360- 12:12.580* :  Please don't play politics over animals.
*12:13.160- 12:13.940* :  Please don't.
*12:13.940- 12:16.380* :  It's not very difficult to keep them alive.
*12:16.960- 12:20.920* :  Many people accused the government of using this law to distract from political issues.
*12:20.980- 12:26.120* :  President Urduan's party suffered heavy defeats in local elections this spring, and the country
*12:26.120- 12:28.580* :  is grappling with a worsening economic crisis.
*12:29.320- 12:35.500* :  Despite the nationwide uproar over the legislation, it's expected to pass in Parliament later this month.
*12:36.240- 12:41.240* :  Anna Aslam, a record number of children in sub-Saharan Africa are enrolled in school,
*12:41.420- 12:46.380* :  but according to the United Nations, 90 percent of pupils under the age of 10 still struggle
*12:46.380- 12:48.700* :  to read and understand simple text.
*12:49.220- 12:54.860* :  One country that has recently invested massively in education is Zambia, but what difference has
*12:54.860- 12:55.240* :  it made?
*12:55.780- 12:57.480* :  Laila Muhammad has been investigating.
*13:02.000- 13:08.700* :  Since 2021, Zambia has spent over one and a half billion dollars in making primary and
*13:08.700- 13:10.160* :  secondary education free.
*13:12.940- 13:19.260* :  Without free education, I don't know how my parents would have managed to take me back to school.
*13:19.840- 13:25.260* :  18-year-old Mariana is one of two million students who's been able to return to education,
*13:26.260- 13:30.560* :  but the opportunity of free learning has also created new challenges.
*13:31.500- 13:35.800* :  I met Cheyenne Junior School about an hour's drive south of Lusaka.
*13:36.460- 13:42.620* :  Here, free education has brought hundreds of children back into the classroom in such a short
*13:42.640- 13:43.100* :  time.
*13:43.800- 13:47.380* :  This has created challenges of overcrowding and a shortage of teachers.
*13:52.560- 13:56.980* :  Cleopatra Zulu is an early childhood education teacher at Cheyenne.
*13:57.560- 14:05.580* :  When I started, I had at least a smaller number 40, but this time around is 105, 80, 90,
*14:05.580- 14:07.280* :  and that's just one class.
*14:07.920- 14:08.600* :  It's a challenge.
*14:08.840- 14:09.620* :  Even marketing.
*14:09.620- 14:13.520* :  We have even reduced even the number of subjects that we are giving them.
*14:14.760- 14:19.740* :  These students have to sit on the floor because of lack of desks, which has a negative impact
*14:19.740- 14:20.580* :  on their learning.
*14:22.060- 14:26.840* :  The government in Lusaka says it's listing, and it's taking steps to address the challenges
*14:26.840- 14:28.220* :  of free education.
*14:28.800- 14:30.080* :  This is a good problem.
*14:30.440- 14:33.920* :  Mr. Douglas Sia Calima is the Education Minister in Zambia.
*14:34.260- 14:38.040* :  I'd rather let the children in a congested classroom, rather than in the streets.
*14:38.480- 14:42.540* :  What the president did was increase mass production of desks.
*14:42.860- 14:44.980* :  Infrastructure building is happening.
*14:45.420- 14:51.840* :  The Zambian government has hired more than 37,000 teachers in two years, but with Zambia
*14:51.840- 14:56.800* :  still recovering from a debt default, some experts have cast doubt over the sustainability
*14:56.800- 14:58.980* :  of the free education policy.
*14:59.440- 15:03.680* :  The Minister of Education says he is confident they can bear the cost.
*15:04.420- 15:05.980* :  That report by Lala Mahamed.
*15:09.540- 15:14.500* :  Still to come on the podcast, growing numbers of people with terminal illnesses are choosing
*15:14.500- 15:17.760* :  to hold a funeral before their death.
*15:18.260- 15:24.260* :  He had the terminal diagnosis, so he decided that he wanted to have a living funeral.
*15:24.560- 15:30.080* :  He wanted the charge to say goodbye to friends and family, and for everyone to celebrate
*15:30.520- 15:30.920* :  his life.
*15:39.640- 15:41.760* :  He was a kind of vigilante killer.
*15:42.200- 15:46.120* :  He killed at least 19 people during the 1980s in South Africa.
*15:46.500- 15:47.440* :  Very dark times.
*15:47.940- 15:48.960* :  People were desperate.
*15:49.420- 15:50.560* :  We were looking for him.
*15:50.700- 15:51.900* :  We couldn't find him.
*15:52.200- 15:53.560* :  And nobody knew where he was.
*15:54.420- 15:56.900* :  Every single one of his victims was black.
*15:57.720- 16:00.540* :  In each such a state where he was now hunting.
*16:01.620- 16:07.140* :  World of Secrets from the BBC World Service, season three, the apartheid killer.
*16:07.820- 16:11.160* :  Search for World of Secrets wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*16:20.480- 16:22.280* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast.
*16:23.080- 16:27.900* :  In the latest cross-border clash, Hasbolla says two of its fighters have been killed in
*16:27.900- 16:29.960* :  an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon.
*16:30.560- 16:34.920* :  A drone is reported to have hit a car and a motorbike travelling between towns near
*16:34.920- 16:35.320* :  the border.
*16:35.940- 16:37.560* :  Israel has not yet commented.
*16:38.120- 16:44.160* :  Tension has been growing in anticipation of a significant Israeli retaliation for Saturday's
*16:44.340- 16:49.340* :  deadly rocket attack on the occupied Golan Heights, which killed 12 people.
*16:49.900- 16:50.960* :  Most of them, children.
*16:51.740- 16:57.540* :  Israel has blamed Hasbolla, but the Lebanese militant group has denied being involved.
*16:58.120- 17:02.420* :  On Sunday, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a visit to Washington to
*17:02.420- 17:06.640* :  rush back for a security cabinet meeting for authorisation on how to respond.
*17:07.560- 17:13.120* :  Amid fears that this could escalate into a full-blown war which could draw in Iran, a
*17:13.120- 17:15.360* :  backer of both Hasbolla and Hamas.
*17:15.940- 17:19.800* :  Our correspondent, Paul Adams, is in Magdaal Shams where the children were killed.
*17:20.220- 17:24.940* :  He spoke to Brigadier General Alan Friedman, deputy commander of the Israeli Army's Northern
*17:24.940- 17:25.340* :  Command.
*17:26.660- 17:32.260* :  Israel and the IDF and the Northern Command have several way options to solve the problem
*17:32.520- 17:33.600* :  in the Northern arena.
*17:33.600- 17:38.880* :  We are preparing, we are ready, and once the decision will take, we know what to do.
*17:39.420- 17:45.060* :  After what happened in Tel Aviv, you immediately, almost immediately, did a huge operation in Yemen.
*17:45.600- 17:46.860* :  Twelve people died here.
*17:47.100- 17:50.660* :  People are really demanding something different.
*17:51.120- 17:56.800* :  The most important thing is that we have to remember that our war is a regional war,
*17:57.280- 18:02.680* :  that, including what is going with Hamas in Gaza, it's going with the Khutim in Yemen,
*18:03.300- 18:09.440* :  connecting to what is going here in Lebanon, what everything is connected together to the
*18:10.440- 18:11.780* :  head, which is Iran.
*18:13.240- 18:17.120* :  Your land is now, as our correspondent, Nindraous Lumin gave this update to my colleague,
*18:17.120- 18:18.220* :  Anita McVeigh.
*18:18.860- 18:23.220* :  We know that the Israeli Prime Minister and his defence minister have been meeting the
*18:23.220- 18:26.400* :  top security officials to discuss their different options.
*18:26.460- 18:32.480* :  Israeli military commentators speculating that what's being considered could be an attack
*18:32.480- 18:36.340* :  on a major Hezbollah target deep inside Lebanon.
*18:36.460- 18:42.640* :  Otherwise, they say there could possibly be an attack on Lebanese civilian infrastructure.
*18:42.660- 18:48.300* :  But part of the calculation must really be looking at the fact that Hezbollah has a big
*18:48.300- 18:50.180* :  arsenal of longer-range weapons.
*18:50.760- 18:54.740* :  How could it respond to an attack of this nature?
*18:55.720- 19:00.140* :  And that is really sort of, you know, that the big question mark hanging over the region
*19:00.140- 19:05.300* :  at the moment, things are very much on edge as we wait to see exactly what will happen.
*19:05.520- 19:11.660* :  And with Benjamin Netanyahu just back from his trip to Washington, what pressure do you
*19:11.660- 19:18.200* :  think the U.S. and other key countries can bring to bear in terms of urging restraint?
*19:18.200- 19:22.660* :  We know that Anthony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, has had a phone call with the Israeli
*19:22.660- 19:23.140* :  President.
*19:23.400- 19:23.780* :  That's right.
*19:24.260- 19:29.460* :  There's been lots of international diplomatic activity going on trying to really press
*19:29.460- 19:32.920* :  for restraint, trying to get Israel to limit its response.
*19:32.920- 19:39.660* :  There is so much concern about what could happen that other powers could be dragged into an
*19:39.660- 19:41.880* :  escalating war in this region.
*19:41.880- 19:44.180* :  Of course, Hezbollah backed by Iran.
*19:44.600- 19:49.120* :  There are proxies around the region for Iran as well that could get involved.
*19:49.120- 19:52.220* :  The U.S. would find it very difficult to stay out of this.
*19:52.220- 19:58.000* :  The White House did put out a statement talking about its eye and clad commitment to Israel's
*19:58.000- 19:58.480* :  security.
*19:58.780- 20:03.220* :  But we also heard from the U.S. Secretary of State that, you know, things should be done
*20:03.220- 20:06.820* :  diplomatic efforts being made to try to de-escalate this situation.
*20:07.620- 20:08.360* :  You land now.
*20:08.880- 20:13.340* :  Meanwhile, several international airlines, including Air France and Lufthansa, have suspended
*20:13.340- 20:15.400* :  flights to the Lebanese capital, Beirut.
*20:15.520- 20:19.380* :  And Germany has told its citizens to leave Lebanon immediately.
*20:20.140- 20:25.540* :  Hugo Busceger is in Tire in southern Lebanon and told us about the mood on the ground there.
*20:26.100- 20:29.520* :  Lebanon is now waiting for this Israeli reaction.
*20:29.700- 20:35.960* :  And I think, you know, the fact that this Israeli response hasn't happened yet could
*20:35.960- 20:43.180* :  be seen as a positive sign because it could help lower the temperature and give more
*20:43.180- 20:47.680* :  time for diplomacy to work, as your learned was saying, there has been a lot of diplomatic
*20:47.680- 20:55.480* :  activity happening behind the scenes to try to limit this Israeli attack to avoid a
*20:55.480- 21:00.760* :  major escalation that could put Hezbollah in a position where they feel they have to
*21:01.320- 21:01.980* :  retaliate.
*21:01.980- 21:08.080* :  I think Hezbollah is prepared to accept an attack that follows what they describe as rules
*21:08.080- 21:08.780* :  of engagement.
*21:08.780- 21:12.780* :  In other words, targets that are military targets, Hezbollah targets.
*21:12.780- 21:19.520* :  So any kind of attack on Beirut, the Lebanese capital, or on Lebanese civilian infrastructure
*21:19.520- 21:22.580* :  could be seen as a major escalation by Hezbollah.
*21:23.000- 21:29.260* :  And as a result, a trigger a response by the group that is supported by Iran, a powerful
*21:29.260- 21:30.420* :  group here in Lebanon.
*21:30.420- 21:35.140* :  But we still don't know, we're still waiting for this response to happen.
*21:35.140- 21:40.320* :  But obviously, this has been the fear here since these attacks by Hezbollah started back
*21:40.320- 21:48.940* :  in October that any kind of miscalculation could trigger a major conflict between Israel
*21:48.940- 21:50.280* :  and Hezbollah.
*21:50.460- 21:55.920* :  And as the country waits for this Israeli attack, we're seeing already the impact that
*21:55.920- 21:57.780* :  this is having on Lebanon.
*21:57.780- 22:04.200* :  A number of flights have been canceled and suspended at Beirut's international airport,
*22:04.200- 22:06.940* :  which is the only airport in Lebanon.
*22:06.940- 22:10.320* :  So this tense wave continues here in Lebanon.
*22:11.380- 22:15.940* :  And there is a lot of anticipation ahead of this possible Israeli attack.
*22:16.740- 22:17.480* :  You go, Bishaga.
*22:18.060- 22:24.420* :  Now, the current consensus is that animal life began around 635 million years ago.
*22:24.760- 22:28.780* :  But new research from a group of scientists working in West Africa suggests that figure
*22:28.980- 22:31.020* :  is way, way out.
*22:31.020- 22:35.920* :  And that complex life actually began much earlier, more than two billion years ago.
*22:36.440- 22:39.820* :  But not all scientists agree, they say more evidence is needed.
*22:39.820- 22:41.460* :  David Lewis has the details.
*22:42.300- 22:46.360* :  It's a discovery that could turn our understanding of evolution upside down.
*22:46.760- 22:49.440* :  But just how have the team arrived at this theory?
*22:49.780- 22:53.420* :  Or the group have been studying rock formations in front of Il Gabon.
*22:53.760- 22:58.820* :  Their quest was to find if they showed evidence of containing nutrients like oxygen and phosphorus
*22:59.380- 23:00.580* :  that could have supported life.
*23:00.920- 23:02.780* :  And according to scientists, they do.
*23:03.000- 23:07.840* :  The chemistry of the rock, they say, showed evidence that a laboratory for life was created
*23:08.320- 23:09.900* :  just before the formation appeared.
*23:10.480- 23:15.200* :  The first hint that complex life could have begun this early came about a decade ago
*23:15.200- 23:18.480* :  with a discovery of something called the front civilian formation.
*23:18.880- 23:24.740* :  Professor Ernest Chi Thru from Cardiff University, who led this expedition to Gabon, said the
*23:24.740- 23:29.960* :  formation was made up of fossils which pointed to evidence of life that could wiggle and
*23:29.960- 23:31.140* :  move of its own accord.
*23:31.580- 23:35.240* :  And theories just like the natural world evolve over time.
*23:35.580- 23:40.920* :  He told BBC News that if his new ideas are correct, these life forms would have been
*23:40.920- 23:46.720* :  similar to slime mold, a brainless single cell organism that reproduces with spores and
*23:46.760- 23:47.860* :  vital to evolution.
*23:48.260- 23:51.680* :  You can see the structures as someone moving in the sediment.
*23:51.680- 23:58.020* :  You could see the traces of movement and movement itself is a very complex thing and it takes
*23:58.020- 24:02.060* :  time to actually be able to do that sort of thing and we don't see that around the
*24:02.240- 24:02.460* :  spirit.
*24:02.660- 24:08.000* :  They look like worms, but we think that those things were probably like slime molds and they were
*24:08.000- 24:12.860* :  able to, in the same fashion, congregate to get and build structures like individuals
*24:12.860- 24:16.080* :  that were more to cellular, not just a single cell.
*24:16.380- 24:20.680* :  Professor Chi Thru's team believed that high levels of oxygen and phosphorus were made
*24:20.680- 24:25.400* :  by two continental plates colliding underwater, creating volcanic activity.
*24:25.820- 24:31.080* :  That collision cut off a section of water from the oceans, creating a nutrient rich shallow
*24:31.080- 24:32.540* :  marine inland sea.
*24:32.920- 24:36.460* :  But according to him, modern life did not descend from there.
*24:36.460- 24:42.400* :  The team contests that organisms were restricted to an inland sea and did not spread globally
*24:42.820- 24:44.120* :  and eventually died out.
*24:44.580- 24:45.140* :  David Lewis.
*24:45.700- 24:50.380* :  Indonesia's leader, Jocco Vidodo, has spent his first night in the presidential palace
*24:50.380- 24:53.380* :  of what will be the country's new capital, Nusantara.
*24:53.380- 24:58.460* :  The current one, Jakarta, is overcrowded and sinking, as Mickey Bristol reports.
*24:59.600- 25:03.960* :  Indonesia's new capital appears to be a project close to the president's heart.
*25:04.580- 25:09.940* :  He rode into Nusantara on a motorbike, and after spending his first night in the Eagle-shaped
*25:09.940- 25:13.400* :  presidential palace, he had his first official meetings.
*25:14.160- 25:19.660* :  Mr. Vidodo, who steps down in October, is scheduled to oversee Independence Day celebrations
*25:19.660- 25:24.860* :  in the new city next month, but there have been numerous delays, and there are many doubts
*25:24.860- 25:31.120* :  over its ultimate viability, even the president admits that it could take two decades to complete
*25:31.120- 25:33.100* :  Indonesia's future capital.
*25:34.020- 25:34.540* :  Mickey Bristol.
*25:35.660- 25:41.480* :  There's a comic Irish folk song called Invitation to a Funeral, which ends with the line, never
*25:41.480- 25:43.680* :  go to funerals until the fellow dies.
*25:44.300- 25:48.620* :  Well, the joke doesn't always work these days because a number of terminally ill people
*25:48.620- 25:53.400* :  are choosing to hold so-called living funerals before they die.
*25:53.980- 25:54.420* :  But why?
*25:55.020- 25:58.020* :  We've been getting the views of some people here in the UK.
*26:03.180- 26:10.000* :  Our son passed away in November last year, after a certain half year battle with leukemia.
*26:10.460- 26:13.340* :  He was a weak shoulder of his 34th birthday when he passed.
*26:13.940- 26:19.940* :  He had the terminal diagnosis, so he decided that he wanted to have a living funeral.
*26:20.240- 26:25.780* :  He wanted the chance to say goodbye to friends and family, and for everyone to celebrate
*26:26.260- 26:26.640* :  his life.
*26:27.040- 26:30.020* :  The living funeral is for the patient.
*26:30.100- 26:35.120* :  I don't know about you, but I've been to many funerals sadly, and in the wake afterwards
*26:35.120- 26:38.840* :  you will always hear people say, oh, they would have loved this, if only they were here,
*26:38.840- 26:40.340* :  they would have really enjoyed this.
*26:40.640- 26:43.920* :  So this gives them the chance to be part of that and actually enjoy it.
*26:44.400- 26:49.080* :  They say their own eulogy, you know, they reflect on their life, the good, the highs, the
*26:49.480- 26:49.500* :  lows.
*26:49.720- 26:56.100* :  It is more about that celebration of their own life, and having that final party that they'll
*26:59.820- 26:59.860* :  ever have.
*26:59.880- 27:08.140* :  I had breast cancer, which metastasized to my brain, and then I was given months to live.
*27:08.660- 27:13.380* :  I didn't want to have a funeral where I wasn't involved in it.
*27:13.940- 27:20.020* :  I wanted to say a really fun farewell to all the people I loved and the people who loved
*27:20.060- 27:20.400* :  me.
*27:21.180- 27:25.640* :  I wanted to be there and share how peaceful I was feeling.
*27:26.720- 27:34.180* :  It was so, so emotional, and I just got to hear how people truly felt about me, and
*27:34.200- 27:35.500* :  it was so special.
*27:36.140- 27:43.360* :  There were songs, a little help from my friends, which was very pertinent to me, but it was
*27:43.360- 27:44.800* :  the Jococ version.
*27:58.780- 28:03.580* :  What concerns me about these letting the funerals is that people are thinking that the funerals
*28:03.580- 28:04.340* :  are about them.
*28:04.840- 28:09.440* :  Obviously, funerals do need to celebrate the life of the person, they do need to talk
*28:09.440- 28:15.040* :  about how they have contributed to this world and to this life, but to only have them
*28:15.040- 28:21.020* :  about the person and their life and what they've given to this world is neglecting the
*28:21.020- 28:26.080* :  really important part of funerals, enabling people to realise that the person has now
*28:26.080- 28:26.400* :  gone.
*28:26.900- 28:32.100* :  And that is often the beginning of acceptance, which in itself begins the grief journey.
*28:32.700- 28:38.000* :  To have the funeral before the person has died is actually feeding into a culture of
*28:38.000- 28:44.040* :  pushing death away and denying death and actually accentuating the problem of people not
*28:44.040- 28:48.580* :  processing grief, which is a worrying thing because suppressed grief leads to problems,
*28:48.580- 28:50.780* :  not least our mental health problem that we have today.
*28:55.460- 28:59.040* :  Some views there on the idea of living funerals.
*29:00.940- 29:06.020* :  Robert Downey, Jr., is making a shock return to the Marvel superhero world after five
*29:06.020- 29:10.900* :  years away, but not in the Iron Man role that launched the multi-billion dollar franchise.
*29:11.600- 29:12.820* :  So who will he be?
*29:12.820- 29:18.700* :  His new character was unmasked at the comic con event in the Californian city of San Diego
*29:19.160- 29:20.560* :  as Paddy McGuire reports.
*29:21.620- 29:27.100* :  Sixteen years, 33 films and 30 billion dollars in box office takings later, the Marvel
*29:27.100- 29:29.720* :  Cinematic Universe has floundered in recent time.
*29:30.180- 29:31.220* :  Scientists have been down.
*29:31.600- 29:35.280* :  There's a slight, perhaps understandable air of superhero fatigue.
*29:35.880- 29:40.680* :  So when stars joining the franchise were unveiled in hall H at the comic con event, the
*29:40.680- 29:46.180* :  anticipation among fans was palpable, was their universe going to be saved, and if so,
*29:46.480- 29:46.980* :  by whom?
*29:47.380- 29:52.320* :  Flanked by a posse of hooded figures, Dr. Victor Von Doom, one of Marvel's biggest villains,
*29:52.880- 29:59.760* :  appeared on stage in his Bayes Green cloak, and slowly lifted his iconic metallic mask.
*30:02.140- 30:03.480* :  The fans had lost their minds.
*30:03.540- 30:08.200* :  Robert Downey Jr. to play a mega villain known for his sorcery in science.
*30:09.000- 30:09.720* :  You mask.
*30:11.540- 30:12.360* :  See you task.
