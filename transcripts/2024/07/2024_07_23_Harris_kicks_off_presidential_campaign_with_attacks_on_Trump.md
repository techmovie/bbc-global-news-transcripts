*01:19.080- 01:22.340* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.160- 01:30.540* :  I'm Rachel Wright, and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 23rd of July, these are our main stories.
*01:31.100- 01:35.200* :  Kamala Harris has told supporters the Democrats will win the US election,
*01:35.200- 01:39.920* :  as the party appears to be consolidating around her to become the next president.
*01:39.980- 01:45.420* :  In his first comments since dropping out of the race, Joe Biden told the same event
*01:45.420- 01:51.440* :  that Democrats should embrace Ms. Harris. A head of the US Secret Service has told Congress that
*01:51.440- 01:56.220* :  the assassination attempt on Donald Trump was its most significant failure in decades.
*01:59.340- 02:04.540* :  Also in this podcast, it's a theme park, a holiday theme park, and we don't want it.
*02:04.900- 02:07.500* :  It's impossible to live here in this situation.
*02:08.640- 02:11.420* :  Anti-tourist feelings intensify in Spain.
*02:17.100- 02:21.140* :  After President Biden announced he was abandoning his bid for re-election,
*02:21.140- 02:25.780* :  his Vice President Kamala Harris appears solidly on track to take his place.
*02:25.820- 02:30.660* :  In the past few hours, she's been addressing supporters and Mr. Biden's hometown,
*02:30.660- 02:35.440* :  Wilmington in Delaware, in what was her first campaign speech for president,
*02:35.440- 02:40.580* :  before she spoke, Democratic Party activists heard a familiar voice on the telephone.
*03:06.700- 03:08.940* :  And we get so much more we're going to get done.
*03:09.500- 03:13.320* :  And so I want to say hello to Kamala. If she can hear me, I know she's going to be speaking shortly.
*03:14.060- 03:17.600* :  And I want to say to the team, embrace her. She's the best.
*03:18.180- 03:21.740* :  I want to thank everybody in this effort.
*03:22.260- 03:27.920* :  I know yesterday's news is surprising, and it's hard for you to hear, but it was the right
*03:27.920- 03:33.600* :  thing to do. I know it's hard because you poured your heart and soul into me.
*03:33.900- 03:38.560* :  So help us win this thing, help me get this nomination, help me win the nomination,
*03:39.060- 03:44.960* :  and then go on to win the presidency. But you know, you're an amazing team, but
*03:45.420- 03:48.120* :  we've got a great, great, I think we made the right decision.
*03:48.660- 03:52.880* :  Following that endorsement for president, Kamala Harris addressed her supporters.
*03:53.380- 03:58.380* :  As many of you know, before I was elected as Vice President, before I was elected as
*03:58.380- 04:03.100* :  United States Senator, I was the elected Attorney General. I've mentioned to California.
*04:03.100- 04:08.540* :  Before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds.
*04:18.400- 04:24.100* :  Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers,
*04:25.400- 04:30.880* :  cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say,
*04:32.240- 04:33.940* :  I know Donald Trump's type.
*04:39.520- 04:43.900* :  And in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his.
*04:47.520- 04:52.140* :  As a young prosecutor, I specialize in cases involving sexual abuse.
*04:53.540- 04:57.440* :  Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse.
*04:58.860- 05:04.200* :  But make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump.
*05:04.820- 05:11.620* :  Our campaign has always been about two different visions, one focused on the future,
*05:12.760- 05:18.660* :  the other on the past. Donald Trump wants to take our country backward.
*05:19.020- 05:23.720* :  To a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights.
*05:25.180- 05:32.360* :  But we believe in a brighter future, in a future where every person has the opportunity,
*05:32.840- 05:35.600* :  not just to get by, but to get ahead.
*05:38.080- 05:42.140* :  We believe in a future where no child has to grow up in poverty,
*05:43.680- 05:47.780* :  where every person can buy a home, start a family and build wealth.
*05:49.580- 05:54.340* :  And where every person has access to paid family leave an affordable child care.
*05:56.280- 06:02.660* :  That's the future we see, together we fight to build a nation where every person has
*06:03.140- 06:08.340* :  affordable health care, where every worker is paid fairly, and where every
*06:08.340- 06:10.620* :  senior can retire with dignity.
*06:10.620- 06:10.980* :  Yeah.
*06:15.300- 06:18.180* :  Kamala Harris addressing her supporters earlier.
*06:18.320- 06:25.220* :  Speaking to Steve Lye, the BBC's Sumi Somiscanda in Washington told us more about Ms. Harris' speech.
*06:25.260- 06:30.720* :  If you look at the video and the rapturous applause that Kamala Harris received at the
*06:30.720- 06:36.080* :  campaign headquarters, it felt like something of a homecoming. Of course, Delaware is not Kamala
*06:36.080- 06:39.780* :  Harris's home. That is where Joe Biden, of course, has his beach home, where he has been the
*06:39.780- 06:45.360* :  last few days, where he made this momentous decision to bow out of the race and to endorse his
*06:45.360- 06:50.860* :  vice president, Kamala Harris. But you could sense the warmth in that room. And we saw the second
*06:50.860- 06:56.820* :  gentleman, Kamala Harris' husband, Doug M. Hoff there as well. And this really has been the moment,
*06:56.900- 07:01.720* :  I believe, that has now set forth the coming days. Kamala Harris saying very clearly as she was
*07:01.720- 07:08.400* :  speaking, the baton is in our hands. We have the obligation, rather, to move forward with what
*07:08.400- 07:13.620* :  our forefathers have fought for, which is the right to vote. The right of bodily autonomy.
*07:13.620- 07:18.340* :  She talked a lot about abortion rights as well. And she talked about the need to unify the party.
*07:18.500- 07:22.880* :  Of course, unify the Democrats, because as you know, Steve, in the weeks leading up to this,
*07:23.240- 07:28.720* :  there was a crisis in the party over President Biden staying in the race. She's now talking about
*07:28.720- 07:33.880* :  the need to bring Democrats, both voters and party delegates together, and also unify the
*07:33.880- 07:39.040* :  country after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. It is a message, I believe, that we will
*07:39.040- 07:43.840* :  hear from Kamala Harris again as she goes out onto the campaign trail, but it gives us a sense
*07:43.900- 07:50.400* :  of the mood, which she is taking out onto the trail. And Joe Biden featured heavily in her
*07:50.400- 07:57.480* :  speech. We also heard from him before she came out to talk as well. It seems like they, the two of
*07:57.480- 08:03.040* :  them, are so unified going forward. What happens to Joe Biden now? He's been getting glowing
*08:03.040- 08:08.640* :  praises from Democrats across the board for making this decision that some say was too long in the
*08:08.640- 08:13.320* :  coming. Indeed. And we know right now, President Biden is still recovering from COVID at his
*08:13.320- 08:17.840* :  beach home in Delaware. So that is why we haven't actually seen him address the public. He said he
*08:17.840- 08:22.720* :  will address the nation. We anticipate that that will happen at some time this week at some point.
*08:22.800- 08:28.200* :  And we'll see him also try to drum up as much support as possible for Kamala Harris. We heard
*08:28.200- 08:31.860* :  that in that call just as he was calling it to headquarters, didn't we, saying, you know, this
*08:31.860- 08:38.420* :  is our candidate. And I anticipate that Joe Biden's team will do as much as they can to bring
*08:38.420- 08:44.100* :  the delegates, bring the party and bring voters around Kamala Harris as they try in this little
*08:44.100- 08:50.440* :  time that has left 106 days to beat Donald Trump. It's a full steam ahead. It really is. Of course,
*08:50.440- 08:54.960* :  Kamala Harris does still have to be cemented as the nominee. That would happen at the convention,
*08:54.960- 09:02.160* :  which starts on August 19th and on August 22nd. And that very week, that is when we expect Kamala Harris
*09:02.160- 09:07.140* :  should she again cement that nomination to deliver speech and officially accept the nomination.
*09:07.660- 09:11.400* :  But from there, you know, we really are hitting the ground running. As you know, Steve, you were
*09:11.400- 09:16.060* :  saying very little time for Kamala Harris to move this campaign forward. And we're already seeing
*09:16.060- 09:20.960* :  Donald Trump and his vice presidential nominee JD Vance attacking Kamala Harris on a number of
*09:20.960- 09:26.000* :  issues. Chiefly immigration. This was her portfolio in the Biden administration. And they are
*09:26.000- 09:30.460* :  saying that she is just as responsible for what they call the failures of the Biden administration
*09:30.460- 09:38.040* :  as Joe Biden was. Sumi Somaskanda. So how would any election campaign between Kamala Harris and
*09:38.040- 09:44.440* :  Donald Trump play out? Is the U.S. ready to elect Kamala Harris? Here's a taste of the former
*09:44.440- 09:50.380* :  president talking rudely about her to tuck a Carlson on his show on X formally Twitter last summer,
*09:50.860- 09:56.540* :  comparing Miss Harris to President Biden. She has some bad moments. Her moments are almost as bad as
*09:56.540- 10:02.660* :  as I think his or worse, actually. Yeah. But she seems pretty seen out too. She speaks in in rhyme.
*10:03.640- 10:10.700* :  You know, it's weird. It's weird. But she has bad moments and in rhyme. Well, the way she talks,
*10:10.700- 10:15.580* :  the bus will go here and then the bus will go there because that's what buses do. And it's
*10:15.580- 10:20.500* :  weird. The whole thing is weird. This is not a president of the United States future. And this
*10:20.500- 10:27.320* :  at his lost rally. From the moment we take back the White House from Crooked Joe Biden and Kamala,
*10:27.320- 10:34.120* :  I call her laughing Kamala. You ever watch her laugh? She's crazy. You know, you can tell a lot
*10:34.120- 10:40.140* :  by a laugh. No, she's crazy. She's nuts. She's not as crazy as Nancy Pelosi. Crazy, Nancy.
*10:41.580- 10:47.460* :  Sydney Blumenthal is a writer and journalist and formerly a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton
*10:47.460- 10:53.340* :  and Hillary Clinton. Has his mood changed since the announcement that Joe Biden wouldn't be pursuing
*10:53.340- 11:00.300* :  re-election and that he was endorsing Miss Harris? The cloud has lifted. It came like a lightning
*11:00.300- 11:08.320* :  bolt. Two days ago, the Democratic Party was in a state of shambles, disorder, and dividing
*11:08.320- 11:15.880* :  further. And it looked that there would be a process of disintegration going on for weeks to
*11:15.880- 11:24.100* :  the convention. And all of that ended in a flash. And Joe Biden is now acclaimed as a second
*11:24.100- 11:32.920* :  George Washington as a Cincinnati who is now returning to the plow after having served his
*11:32.920- 11:38.880* :  country and a great patriot. Now, what has been surprising is the speed at which she seems to be
*11:38.880- 11:44.580* :  locked in as the Democrat candidate in November. Is that a done deal and should that be a done deal?
*11:45.260- 11:51.860* :  It is a done deal. All the party chairs from the states have endorsed her and she has garnered
*11:52.220- 11:59.100* :  universal support. The party wants no more of division and wants to go forward against the
*11:59.100- 12:07.100* :  clear and present danger of Donald Trump. I think she understands the enormous menace that
*12:07.100- 12:13.600* :  Trump poses. She's ready for that. Right. Let's look ahead to the election campaign. You've
*12:13.600- 12:18.700* :  heard a little of where Trump, where his attack lines are against her that she giggles a lot.
*12:18.700- 12:25.120* :  He mocks her. He mocks lots of people. Are you fearful? He's already started a misogynist campaign
*12:25.260- 12:32.120* :  trying to demean and ridicule her as a woman. She's laughing. She has a funny voice. She doesn't
*12:32.120- 12:39.500* :  look like a president. He does this continually to women. And we all know his record of sexual
*12:39.500- 12:44.760* :  harassment and how he's an adjudicated rapist. His handlers are going to have a terrible time
*12:44.800- 12:51.800* :  trying to control that in him as well as the racist undertone that's coming. And let me say
*12:51.980- 12:58.460* :  naming his vice president, J.D. Vance, the senator from Ohio, who is married to the South Asian.
*12:59.140- 13:06.720* :  A good part already of Trump's white supremacist supporters have begun on the internet.
*13:06.720- 13:13.720* :  Vicious racist attacks on J.D. Vance's wife. We are still in a situation where Kamala Harris
*13:13.720- 13:18.960* :  maybe looks a little bit better placed in the polls than Joe Biden would have. But
*13:19.680- 13:24.540* :  doesn't have a margin over Donald Trump in the polls and a Democrat needs to be ahead in order to
*13:24.580- 13:32.640* :  win. Kamala Harris has enormous appeal to blacks, obviously, and also to women. As far as women
*13:32.640- 13:39.260* :  are concerned, since the Supreme Court overturning abortion rights and the Dobbs decision the
*13:39.260- 13:44.360* :  Democrats have not lost a by-election, we're in a very different situation than we were
*13:45.080- 13:50.580* :  when Hillary Clinton was running for president. And Kamala Harris has taken up this issue.
*13:51.380- 13:59.940* :  She has enormous appeal to those swing suburban women on the question of women's rights and women's
*13:59.940- 14:05.780* :  reproductive freedom. She will be carrying that banner against Donald Trump who put three
*14:05.780- 14:12.140* :  justices on the Supreme Court to overturn abortion rights. And it will be a direct conflict.
*14:12.140- 14:20.360* :  And Trump appointed as his vice president, his running-made J.D. Vance, whose previous position
*14:20.360- 14:26.540* :  on abortion was against abortion, even in the cases of rape, incest, and the health of the mother.
*14:27.020- 14:32.380* :  As we heard, that Sydney Blumenthal talking to Evan Davis is one of those who believes that
*14:32.380- 14:38.100* :  Kamala Harris's appeal to women could turn the election in her favor. Our correspondent,
*14:38.100- 14:44.980* :  Emma Vardy, has been sounding out women voters in Phoenix, Arizona, nearly 300 kilometers from
*14:44.980- 14:49.880* :  the border with Mexico, and one of the key swing states that will decide the election.
*14:54.020- 14:59.600* :  After months of the same old candidate singing the same tunes, suddenly the record's changing for
*14:59.600- 15:05.900* :  voters. This diner is a microcosm of the state, with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents
*15:05.900- 15:11.360* :  all eating their breakfast and drinking coffee next to each other. Many people's political views
*15:11.360- 15:16.760* :  are already firmly fixed, and they don't think Vice President Harris changes the contest.
*15:17.560- 15:19.380* :  Alex works as a server at the diner.
*15:19.520- 15:23.040* :  I still think Trump's going to win. I just, I truly think that Trump is a better choice,
*15:23.040- 15:26.920* :  uh, just with the economy. There's Kamala have a better chance of beating Trump?
*15:27.320- 15:32.680* :  Just intellectually, just listening to her speak and listening to Trump speak is like night and day.
*15:32.800- 15:35.700* :  What do you think of Kamala when it comes to the border? Well, she hasn't done anything.
*15:35.700- 15:39.760* :  Our children are here, and criminals are coming across the border, and we need to close it.
*15:39.820- 15:43.540* :  For Democrats supporters, there's some uncertainty about whether Kamala Harris
*15:43.540- 15:49.460* :  becoming the party's candidate without a contest should be a done deal. His Linda, a Democratic voter.
*15:49.640- 15:54.980* :  Our process is like turning upside down. It's just very scary and just heartening.
*15:55.380- 15:59.180* :  There's a lot of people who don't like Trump. They don't trust him.
*15:59.560- 16:02.200* :  Could Kamala do better against Trump than Joe Biden?
*16:03.560- 16:07.540* :  I don't think so. What has she done? What experience has she had?
*16:08.260- 16:12.380* :  Politically, should there be more of a contest that we should take on Trump?
*16:12.500- 16:16.920* :  Yes, I think so, yes, for the Democratic party. Yes, definitely.
*16:16.920- 16:22.020* :  What was clear is that a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump was deeply unpopular.
*16:22.640- 16:27.720* :  Biden pulling out is the latest twist in this historic race, and there's still plenty of time
*16:27.720- 16:34.020* :  for more surprises to come. Emabadi, nine days after Donald Trump was almost killed,
*16:34.020- 16:39.460* :  the director of the U.S. Secret Service, who's meant to protect the former president's life,
*16:39.880- 16:41.860* :  gave a frank admission to Congress.
*16:42.640- 16:46.140* :  The assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump on July 13th
*16:46.780- 16:51.740* :  is the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades,
*16:52.580- 16:54.900* :  and I am keeping him and his family in my thoughts.
*16:55.660- 16:59.640* :  Kimberley Cheatle was giving evidence on Monday to the House of Representatives
*16:59.640- 17:03.020* :  Oversight Committee, made up of Republicans and Democrats.
*17:03.680- 17:06.420* :  Some members, though, weren't satisfied with her admission,
*17:06.900- 17:09.200* :  among them the Republican Nancy Mace.
*17:09.880- 17:14.420* :  Was this a colossal failure? It was a failure.
*17:14.800- 17:18.800* :  Yes or no? Was it a colossal failure? Is the question yes or no?
*17:19.100- 17:20.280* :  I have admitted this is a tear.
*17:20.320- 17:23.780* :  This is a yes or no series of questions. Was this a colossal failure?
*17:24.220- 17:25.120* :  Yes or no?
*17:25.900- 17:29.160* :  Yes. Was this tragedy preventable?
*17:29.420- 17:30.460* :  Yes or no?
*17:31.480- 17:31.640* :  Yes.
*17:32.500- 17:36.280* :  A U.S. correspondent Aaron Delmore watched the testy exchanges.
*17:37.160- 17:39.480* :  By no means has this been an easy day for her.
*17:39.820- 17:42.240* :  She is testifying in front of the House Oversight Committee,
*17:42.760- 17:47.480* :  and the commentary, the questions, and the criticism that's coming in from Congress members.
*17:47.920- 17:53.160* :  Both Republicans and Democrats is really difficult, very sharp, pointed criticism,
*17:53.200- 17:55.220* :  and a high level of frustration.
*17:55.740- 17:56.800* :  It has been more than a week.
*17:56.800- 18:02.000* :  It's been nine days since this assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.
*18:02.420- 18:05.820* :  And repeatedly, we hear the Secret Service directors say that she doesn't have answers
*18:05.820- 18:07.420* :  to the questions that are being asked.
*18:07.860- 18:09.200* :  There are investigations ongoing.
*18:09.200- 18:11.260* :  She is waiting for reports to be filed.
*18:11.260- 18:15.180* :  And hours into this hearing, you can feel that frustration and tension building.
*18:15.760- 18:19.740* :  I mean, you're right. She kept saying investigations are still underway.
*18:19.740- 18:23.820* :  How did the committee, the Republicans and Democrats respond to that?
*18:25.100- 18:29.120* :  With frustration and impatience, you could also say,
*18:29.500- 18:33.140* :  you know, we heard that exchange that you just featured between Representative Mace
*18:33.280- 18:34.500* :  and the Secret Service director.
*18:35.020- 18:38.660* :  And that's pretty spot on for the tenor of this conversation so far.
*18:38.940- 18:42.960* :  I'll also point out there was a very difficult exchange between Mace and the director
*18:43.580- 18:47.100* :  with, involves some cursing, a lot of really pointed language.
*18:47.100- 18:50.120* :  And we also heard from Mike Turner, a congressman from Ohio,
*18:50.780- 18:54.660* :  who just said bluntly that, you know, because President Donald Trump is alive,
*18:54.660- 18:56.440* :  and thank God he is, you looking competent.
*18:56.440- 18:59.980* :  He said, if Donald Trump had been killed, you would have looked culpable.
*19:00.440- 19:02.560* :  They are not holding back here at all.
*19:02.820- 19:06.420* :  And many calls from both sides of the aisle for her to resign.
*19:06.420- 19:09.480* :  Do you think Kimberly Chital can survive off to this?
*19:09.840- 19:13.220* :  She will buy herself an amount of time today,
*19:13.600- 19:14.700* :  and that is certain.
*19:14.700- 19:17.500* :  Now, just to draw her history into the microscope here,
*19:17.940- 19:20.380* :  she has spent more than two decades with the Secret Service
*19:20.380- 19:23.560* :  and then moved into an operational security role for a company.
*19:24.020- 19:25.600* :  So she is a tested hand.
*19:25.600- 19:29.360* :  You know, she's someone who talked at the beginning of her statement today about her time,
*19:29.800- 19:31.240* :  spent protecting other presidents,
*19:31.240- 19:34.100* :  a long lineage of leaders in the United States here.
*19:34.580- 19:37.960* :  But this is being seen by not just the criticism of the lawmakers,
*19:37.960- 19:40.520* :  but her own admission as a security failure,
*19:41.040- 19:43.600* :  even going so far as to say she called it herself
*19:43.600- 19:46.020* :  the most significant operational failure
*19:46.620- 19:48.240* :  by the Secret Service in decades.
*19:49.060- 19:49.820* :  Aaron Delmou.
*19:52.820- 19:53.600* :  Still to come.
*19:53.960- 19:57.120* :  These nodules are actually acting as geobatries.
*19:57.420- 19:59.800* :  They're currently being generated on their surface,
*20:00.100- 20:02.440* :  helping to oxygenate the depotion.
*20:03.100- 20:06.960* :  Oxygen produced on the deep ocean floor by metal nodules.
*20:15.840- 20:17.540* :  It's that time of the year.
*20:18.120- 20:19.760* :  You're a vacation is coming up.
*20:20.440- 20:22.560* :  You can already hear the beach waves,
*20:22.560- 20:28.620* :  feel the warm breeze, relax, and think about work.
*20:28.620- 20:31.880* :  You really, really want it all to work out while you're away.
*20:31.880- 20:34.740* :  Monday.com gives you and the team that piece of mind.

*20:48.100- 20:49.760* :  How often do you compare yourself to others?
*20:50.380- 20:52.540* :  It's easy to envy friends lives on social media,
*20:53.140- 20:55.000* :  but comparison is the thief of joy.
*20:55.440- 20:57.420* :  And in reality, nobody has it all together.
*20:58.040- 21:00.440* :  Online therapy can help you focus on what you want,

*21:21.300- 21:23.860* :  The Hamas Run Health Ministry in Gaza
*21:24.240- 21:27.660* :  says that at least 70 Palestinians were killed in Han Unis
*21:27.860- 21:30.520* :  by Israeli shelling and airstrikes on Monday
*21:30.520- 21:32.840* :  and nearly 200 more were injured.
*21:33.400- 21:36.480* :  The Israeli military has issued new evacuation orders
*21:36.480- 21:39.740* :  causing thousands of civilians to leave temporary shelters
*21:40.180- 21:42.400* :  looking for somewhere safe to take refuge.
*21:43.040- 21:46.660* :  Nine months after the massacre of around 1,200 Israelis,
*21:47.180- 21:50.280* :  there is little sign the war in Gaza will end soon.
*21:50.780- 21:54.920* :  Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams sent this report from Jerusalem.
*21:57.980- 22:01.960* :  Fleeing doesn't get any easier even when you've done it many times before.
*22:03.480- 22:05.780* :  There were scenes of panic as the Israeli army announced
*22:05.780- 22:08.840* :  that it was about to enter Han Unis for the second time.
*22:09.320- 22:11.360* :  Civilians, including children and the elderly,
*22:11.360- 22:14.040* :  some running, carrying handfuls of belongings,
*22:14.040- 22:16.740* :  amid rumors that Israeli tanks were approaching
*22:16.740- 22:20.020* :  and reports that dozens of people had already been killed.
*22:20.780- 22:23.160* :  The number of Palestinians who have died since October,
*22:23.160- 22:26.700* :  civilians and gunmen is now approaching 40,000.
*22:27.260- 22:31.860* :  Israel has told Palestinians to evacuate parts of its self-proclaimed humanitarian zone,
*22:32.220- 22:35.260* :  which stretches from the western edge of Han Unis to the sea.
*22:35.260- 22:38.760* :  It says Hamas fighters are once again operating in the area.
*22:39.380- 22:41.360* :  Israel says there's no need to leave hospitals,
*22:41.360- 22:45.800* :  but the realization that an area previously regarded as relatively safe
*22:45.800- 22:49.920* :  may soon be invaded has added to the sense of impending danger.
*22:50.540- 22:53.520* :  As the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left for Washington,
*22:54.000- 22:56.680* :  the army confirmed the deaths of two more hostages.
*22:57.200- 22:59.140* :  Their bodies are still being held by Hamas,
*22:59.460- 23:03.020* :  but reports in the Israeli media say it's highly likely at least one of them
*23:03.020- 23:05.860* :  was killed by Israeli fire several months ago.
*23:06.480- 23:10.800* :  Paul Adams. Scientists say they've discovered a source of oxygen
*23:10.800- 23:13.840* :  deep in the Pacific Ocean that they never knew existed.
*23:14.560- 23:18.240* :  Until now, we had thought that plants on land and in the sea
*23:18.620- 23:20.700* :  used sunlight to produce oxygen,
*23:21.120- 23:22.760* :  and that's where it comes from in nature.
*23:23.060- 23:26.120* :  But the new discovery is of sun-free oxygen.
*23:26.700- 23:29.780* :  Jeff Marlow from Boston University co-authored the study,
*23:30.140- 23:32.560* :  which is published in Nature Geoscience.
*23:32.560- 23:35.300* :  He told us what happened when they dropped sensors
*23:35.300- 23:38.820* :  to measure signals of oxygen on the dark ocean bed.
*23:39.300- 23:42.220* :  They're meant to measure how much oxygen is being consumed,
*23:42.220- 23:44.680* :  because animals consume oxygen.
*23:45.320- 23:47.420* :  So the more the oxygen goes down,
*23:47.420- 23:49.240* :  the more animal life there is.
*23:49.520- 23:51.240* :  When we started looking through the data,
*23:51.700- 23:55.560* :  the oxygen was going up, and this was very unexpected.
*23:55.580- 23:56.680* :  We were very confused.
*23:57.100- 24:00.400* :  We spent many days and weeks trying to figure out what was happening.
*24:00.400- 24:03.660* :  We tried a bunch of different variants on these experiments.
*24:04.380- 24:07.100* :  And we're forced to conclude, really, that it was a real signal.
*24:07.360- 24:08.980* :  It was a roller coaster, for sure.
*24:09.780- 24:12.360* :  Our science correspondent, Victoria Gill, has more.
*24:12.900- 24:14.900* :  Scientists now realize that for years,
*24:14.900- 24:18.740* :  they've been detecting and ignoring the production of dark oxygen.
*24:19.420- 24:21.380* :  It's a discovery that reveals there's much more
*24:21.380- 24:24.420* :  to the very deep ocean environment than previously thought.
*24:25.200- 24:27.640* :  The researchers say the oxygen is produced by lumps
*24:27.660- 24:30.740* :  or nodules of metal that form naturally on the seabed
*24:30.740- 24:31.920* :  in some parts of the ocean.
*24:32.320- 24:35.220* :  Millions of these metal lumps generate electric currents,
*24:35.220- 24:38.620* :  and that splits molecules of seawater, H2O,
*24:38.620- 24:41.360* :  into hydrogen and oxygen, the H and the O.
*24:41.900- 24:43.140* :  Here's Professor Andrew Sweetman
*24:43.140- 24:45.320* :  from the Scottish Association for Marine Science.
*24:45.700- 24:48.620* :  If you put a battery into seawater, it starts fizzing,
*24:48.820- 24:51.580* :  because the electric current is actually splitting seawater
*24:51.980- 24:53.000* :  into oxygen and hydrogen.
*24:53.820- 24:56.340* :  And what we think is happening is that these nodules
*24:56.720- 25:00.680* :  in their natural state are actually acting as geo batteries.
*25:01.080- 25:03.460* :  There's current being generated on their surface,
*25:03.720- 25:05.440* :  and that is splitting the seawater
*25:05.800- 25:09.060* :  and basically helping to oxygenate the deep ocean.
*25:09.280- 25:12.580* :  The discovery calls into question plans to mine these nodules.
*25:12.640- 25:14.940* :  They contain metals that are vital to build batteries
*25:14.940- 25:17.580* :  for low carbon technologies, such as electric cars.
*25:18.280- 25:20.040* :  In the site where this research was carried out,
*25:20.100- 25:23.260* :  a small section of the vast area of seafloor between Hawaii
*25:23.260- 25:25.840* :  and Mexico known as the Clarion Clipperton Zone.
*25:25.840- 25:28.780* :  Several seabed mining companies are already exploring
*25:28.780- 25:31.780* :  and developing technology to bring the nodules to the surface.
*25:32.480- 25:35.240* :  Even before this dark oxygen revelation, though,
*25:35.240- 25:38.980* :  many marine scientists had warned that seabed mining activity risks
*25:38.980- 25:42.740* :  destroying deep sea ecosystems that we still barely understand.
*25:43.240- 25:44.040* :  Victoria Gill.
*25:44.660- 25:46.020* :  It's a worldwide phenomenon.
*25:46.060- 25:49.460* :  With more of us living to a significantly older age,
*25:49.740- 25:52.180* :  the funds set aside for retirement pots
*25:52.180- 25:54.340* :  are coming under even greater strain.
*25:55.040- 25:56.640* :  No more so than in China.
*25:57.060- 26:00.740* :  Their life expectancy in 1949 was 36.
*26:00.740- 26:02.700* :  Today it's 78.
*26:03.340- 26:07.480* :  Now China has acknowledged that its economy can no longer withstand this pressure
*26:07.980- 26:10.220* :  and announced that it will gradually raise the date
*26:10.220- 26:12.440* :  when people can officially retire.
*26:12.880- 26:15.420* :  Our Asia Pacific editor, Celia Hatton,
*26:15.660- 26:17.360* :  told me what exactly would change.
*26:18.040- 26:21.420* :  Beijing for some time has been signaling that it wants to raise
*26:22.040- 26:24.220* :  the statutory retirement age.
*26:24.780- 26:28.480* :  That's because it really is facing a bit of a population crisis.
*26:28.480- 26:31.720* :  We have a declining birth rate in China.
*26:31.720- 26:33.920* :  For seven years now, it's been declining.
*26:33.920- 26:38.280* :  So we have an aging society, a declining birth rate.
*26:38.640- 26:41.960* :  And that means that there are huge state pension costs.
*26:42.800- 26:47.320* :  28 million people are retiring in China this year alone.
*26:47.640- 26:50.260* :  And so the government's been thinking for some time
*26:50.260- 26:52.200* :  how it's going to address this issue.
*26:52.780- 26:55.880* :  And it wants to raise the retirement age partly because as well,
*26:56.360- 26:58.840* :  the retirement age in China is actually quite low
*26:59.080- 27:00.620* :  compared to other major economies.
*27:00.620- 27:03.720* :  At the moment, it's the age 60 for all men.
*27:03.720- 27:07.240* :  For white collar women, so women working in offices,
*27:07.800- 27:08.520* :  it's 55.
*27:08.520- 27:11.780* :  And for women working in factories doing manual work,
*27:11.780- 27:12.880* :  it's age 50.
*27:13.400- 27:17.700* :  So contrast that with Japan, where it's 10 years higher,
*27:18.540- 27:21.840* :  that's why China really has been thinking of this for some time.
*27:21.840- 27:23.760* :  And it now seems it's going ahead with that plan.
*27:24.040- 27:27.520* :  If that's the case, though, why do you think it's taken so long
*27:27.520- 27:31.700* :  to raise the age if given that it's an economical time bomb?
*27:31.980- 27:35.820* :  It's taken a long time because it's not a very popular policy
*27:35.820- 27:37.060* :  with Chinese people.
*27:37.540- 27:40.360* :  You know, many people in China have lived through
*27:40.360- 27:43.460* :  quite tumultuous years of Chinese history.
*27:43.840- 27:45.720* :  Chinese jobs can be very taxing.
*27:45.740- 27:49.180* :  And so many people are really counting on their retirement
*27:49.180- 27:51.800* :  at age 50, 55 or 60.
*27:51.800- 27:54.220* :  They don't want to be told they have to work longer
*27:54.220- 27:55.880* :  in order to get a state pension.
*27:56.460- 28:01.200* :  There's also a lot of anger among young people in China
*28:01.520- 28:04.840* :  who actually want older people to retire
*28:04.840- 28:06.420* :  so they can open up some jobs.
*28:06.420- 28:09.800* :  But they are worried that the state pension pot is going to start
*28:09.820- 28:10.920* :  to disappear.
*28:11.440- 28:15.340* :  And so there's a lot of unease around the retirement age.
*28:15.340- 28:19.080* :  And so we can see this kind of worry reflected
*28:19.080- 28:21.980* :  in what the Chinese government is saying today.
*28:21.980- 28:24.120* :  They're saying that they want to move towards making
*28:24.520- 28:27.640* :  the retirement age voluntary or flexible.
*28:27.740- 28:31.620* :  So I think at first you might see workers encouraged
*28:31.660- 28:33.600* :  to stay beyond their retirement age.
*28:33.720- 28:37.740* :  At first, maybe they'll be given some extra bonuses for doing so
*28:37.740- 28:41.740* :  before they actually raise the actual statutory retirement age.
*28:42.240- 28:46.660* :  Celia Hatton. Spain's tourism minister condemned protesters
*28:46.760- 28:49.820* :  who used water pistols against visitors to Barcelona
*28:49.820- 28:53.480* :  saying what they did is not in keeping with the country's culture
*28:53.480- 28:54.460* :  of hospitality.
*28:55.100- 28:58.100* :  But there have been more protests about tourists in Spain
*28:58.140- 29:00.120* :  this time on the island of Mallorca,
*29:00.660- 29:03.780* :  with hundreds of islanders taking to the streets at the weekend.
*29:04.340- 29:06.660* :  Our Europe correspondent Nick Beek was there.
*29:07.560- 29:12.700* :  Hey, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
*29:12.880- 29:15.980* :  Well, at this sort of time on a normal Sunday evening
*29:15.980- 29:20.040* :  here in Palmas, Old Town, you would see waves of tourists
*29:20.040- 29:21.100* :  strolling through.
*29:21.780- 29:24.520* :  But for the locals, these aren't normal times.
*29:24.520- 29:27.920* :  And tonight, they're the ones gathering on mass
*29:28.440- 29:30.920* :  to protest against the soaring number of visitors.
*29:31.680- 29:34.820* :  Organizers of this rally are now calling for a limit,
*29:34.940- 29:38.700* :  arguing that the 14 and a half million foreigners
*29:39.080- 29:42.400* :  and 3 and a half million Spaniards who came here last year
*29:42.860- 29:47.340* :  are just too many for the available resources, space, and housing.
*29:47.940- 29:50.600* :  With thousands of people have gathered now in the main square
*29:50.600- 29:54.600* :  and there are flags, banners, placards, as far as the eye can see.
*29:55.280- 29:59.540* :  One placard says, take back your drugs, give back our homes.
*30:00.080- 30:02.620* :  We've just met Alicia, who's an English teacher.
*30:03.340- 30:06.240* :  And she's absolutely furious about what she says
*30:07.160- 30:09.880* :  is the overrunning of her island with tourists.
*30:10.760- 30:12.800* :  It's a theme park, a holiday theme park.
*30:13.020- 30:14.180* :  And we don't want it.
*30:14.500- 30:17.180* :  It's impossible to live here in this situation.
*30:20.740- 30:23.480* :  We meet 31-year-old local resident Sonia,
*30:23.800- 30:26.440* :  playing in the sand with her four-year-old son, Luca.
*30:27.080- 30:29.140* :  Their landlord is throwing them out.
*30:29.720- 30:32.740* :  And she says many flats on the island are being bought up
*30:33.120- 30:36.640* :  and rented out to foreign tourists at prices she just can't afford.
*30:40.780- 30:43.660* :  It's hard to get up every morning and start looking for a flat.
*30:44.340- 30:45.880* :  The prices are higher every day.
*30:46.600- 30:50.380* :  I see me and my son homeless soon because there is absolutely nothing.
*30:54.560- 30:57.620* :  Down the coast at Magaloof, the beach is absolutely packed.
*30:57.620- 31:00.660* :  This remains a favorite spot for British tourists,
*31:01.200- 31:04.680* :  who, together with Germans, make up more than half of all visitors
*31:05.180- 31:06.640* :  to this balearic island.
*31:07.500- 31:10.720* :  As hotel after hotelers sprung up along the coastline,
*31:10.720- 31:15.240* :  the debaters raged as to whether visitors bring more problems
*31:15.240- 31:16.660* :  than they do benefits.
*31:16.660- 31:19.880* :  We meet 25-year-old Pere Joanne Fomenia.
*31:19.920- 31:24.660* :  He's part of a movement that translates as less tourism more life.
*31:24.700- 31:28.780* :  I put it to him that tourism is powering national growth in Spain.
*31:28.780- 31:30.400* :  He rejects that argument.
*31:30.940- 31:34.400* :  Tourism is not creating benefits for people,
*31:34.620- 31:37.600* :  so we know that we have to put a limit.
*31:38.960- 31:41.080* :  Tourism has bounced back after Covid,
*31:41.400- 31:45.540* :  but record levels are provoking what feels like an unprecedented backlash.
*31:46.300- 31:49.000* :  Spain's tourist board is among the leading voices
*31:49.440- 31:54.400* :  warning against undermining a sector which has been propelling the national economy.
*31:55.100- 31:58.880* :  A stiflingly hot summer seems set for more strife.
*32:04.560- 32:05.840* :  And that's all from us for now,
