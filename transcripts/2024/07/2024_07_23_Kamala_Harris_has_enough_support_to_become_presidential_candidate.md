*00:51.560- 00:59.180* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We are recording this at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday the 23rd of July.
*00:59.180- 01:04.240* :  The US Vice President Carmel Harris has secured enough support to become the Democratic Party's
*01:04.240- 01:10.960* :  presidential candidate. China says Hamas, Fata and a dozen other Palestinian factions have agreed
*01:10.960- 01:16.300* :  to set up an interim administration for Gaza, an awarning from Brazil to the controversial
*01:16.300- 01:24.460* :  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Also in the podcast calls for Kenyan police to show more
*01:24.460- 01:29.560* :  restraint after the deaths of dozens of protesters. So the laws are not the problem. I think what is
*01:29.560- 01:35.540* :  problematic is the culture of policing in a context where there is confrontation with the public.
*01:36.300- 01:40.820* :  And diverse dolls, the first blind Barbie goes on sale.
*01:45.760- 01:51.500* :  The US Democratic Party meets in Chicago next month to formally choose its presidential candidate.
*01:51.500- 01:57.600* :  But we already know it will be the current Vice President Carmel Harris. In the two days since Joe
*01:57.600- 02:02.720* :  Biden quit the race, she has secured the backing from the majority of party delegates to become the
*02:02.720- 02:08.260* :  nominee while arrivals have stepped aside. So what is the significance of this well of support,
*02:08.260- 02:13.920* :  the question for our North America editor, Sarah Smith? It means that as soon as the party actually
*02:13.920- 02:19.440* :  takes a vote, a roll call vote of all of those delegates, she will become the party's nominee.
*02:19.440- 02:23.440* :  She isn't yet just because they've pledged her support, but there are no other candidates in
*02:23.440- 02:28.120* :  this race. Nobody has stood up to challenge her. And more than half of the delegates who will be
*02:28.120- 02:32.680* :  going to the Chicago Convention say they're going to vote for her, so that gives her the nomination.
*02:33.160- 02:36.960* :  And curiously enough, actually, the Democratic Party probably aren't going to wait until they get
*02:36.980- 02:42.560* :  to their convention in Chicago. They're going to do this virtually very early in August. I mean,
*02:42.560- 02:47.160* :  maybe even as early as the first of August. So it just a couple of weeks time, she could very well
*02:47.160- 02:51.600* :  be the nominee and get on with choosing who our Vice Presidential candidate will be. But yeah,
*02:51.940- 02:57.240* :  it was pretty clear that although she had been saying very, very supportive things in public about
*02:57.240- 03:02.740* :  Joe Biden, our campaign was pretty ready to go. As soon as he said he was stepping aside,
*03:02.740- 03:09.020* :  they swept in extremely efficiently. And she just started collecting the endorsements of so many
*03:09.020- 03:13.840* :  of the party's most senior leaders. Then all the Democratic governors came in behind her.
*03:13.840- 03:17.960* :  Every single person who was thought maybe to have been somebody who could have challenged her
*03:17.960- 03:22.020* :  for the nomination, who wanted to be the candidate themselves, they all came in and endorsed her,
*03:22.260- 03:26.740* :  and it happened with such speed and such a flurry that she was absolutely unstoppable.
*03:26.740- 03:31.520* :  And the donors opened their wallets at the same time as well. People who had stopped giving
*03:31.520- 03:35.960* :  money to Joe Biden because they were worried about him as the candidate were so relieved when
*03:35.960- 03:39.060* :  he stood aside that she started collecting millions of dollars to.
*03:39.660- 03:45.360* :  Our North America editor, Sarah Smith. Well, on Tuesday afternoon, Kamala Harris will hold her first
*03:45.360- 03:50.880* :  official campaign event in her own right in the swing state of Wisconsin. I heard more from our
*03:50.880- 03:56.080* :  North America correspondent, Nommie Ikbow. It's such an extraordinary whirlwind for her if you
*03:56.080- 04:00.340* :  think about it just before the weekend. She was preparing to potentially debate Donald Trump's
*04:00.340- 04:04.820* :  vice president and then Sunday came that stunning news that Mr. Biden was standing down.
*04:04.820- 04:09.640* :  And the handoff from him to her lasted I think less than two days because all the people that
*04:09.640- 04:14.220* :  could have potentially taken on Miss Harris for the nomination haven't they've endorsed her.
*04:14.540- 04:19.860* :  The Harris campaign has also said that it's first 24 hour haul exceeded $100 million and at
*04:19.860- 04:26.260* :  62% donated for the first time. Also, they said 58,000 people signed up to volunteer for the
*04:26.260- 04:32.200* :  campaign and that gives you a real sense of how re-energized the base is. But she has to get out
*04:32.200- 04:37.040* :  there now and do the hard work. She has to reshape the campaign. She has to choose her vice president.
*04:37.720- 04:41.920* :  She has to get on the stage ultimately and show the country why she can beat Donald Trump.
*04:42.580- 04:47.760* :  Joe Biden, of course, came from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Will Kamala Harris,
*04:47.760- 04:51.900* :  who else from California be able to win over voters in places like Wisconsin?
*04:52.440- 04:59.340* :  And that is the key question, isn't it? Because Joe Biden's background really lent himself
*04:59.340- 05:05.800* :  well to those rustball states. Kamala Harris, if we're being honest here, has not had the highest
*05:05.800- 05:10.200* :  approval rate in certainly in her time as vice president. She also launched her own presidential
*05:10.200- 05:16.860* :  campaign back then for the Democratic Party and it didn't really go very far. She's from California,
*05:16.860- 05:22.140* :  you know, there's a sense that can she connect to the voters that she needs, those key battleground
*05:22.140- 05:27.760* :  states. And that's what I think her vice president pick will be incredibly important. There are
*05:27.760- 05:33.080* :  already some names in the frame. For that, he named that you might have heard is the Pennsylvania
*05:33.080- 05:38.560* :  governor, Josh Shapiro. He could be somebody that would help strengthen that ticket, but that
*05:38.560- 05:43.320* :  will be the big question is if she has what it takes and that's why it will be really interesting
*05:43.320- 05:48.800* :  to see today how she presents the campaign. Nomi Iqbal in Washington, will the president
*05:48.800- 05:54.580* :  himself is returning to the White House after isolating for COVID at his holiday house in Rahoboth,
*05:54.580- 06:00.320* :  Delaware. Our correspondent Ioni Wells has been to the state to see if people there will now back
*06:00.320- 06:09.500* :  Kamala Harris for president. You have here three generations, 70s, 50s. Oh, 40s? Hi. Oh, 40, sorry,
*06:09.500- 06:15.940* :  that's your sister. And preteens. And we all pretty much feel the same way. In terms of
*06:16.240- 06:20.900* :  is Kamala Harris good in terms of being a woman, being younger, being more knowledgeable,
*06:20.900- 06:26.600* :  in certain areas, certainly than Trump, three generations all agree. I think that she really
*06:26.600- 06:31.300* :  knows much more policy than she's been getting credit for because she has really allowed him to take
*06:31.300- 06:36.700* :  the lead in a lot of the policy decisions. I think she attracts more women and people who might
*06:36.700- 06:42.360* :  have been feeling a bit alienated and I think that she's going to electrify and energize the
*06:42.560- 06:48.940* :  voting basis. You have a sign here. Let's see it says thank you for being a good president and some
*06:48.940- 06:55.420* :  love hearts there. Yeah, we made them yesterday after we had heard that he was not going to seek
*06:55.420- 07:00.980* :  the election. And what do you think of Kamala Harris? I think that she is definitely going to be a good
*07:01.360- 07:04.080* :  leader and I also think that she's probably going to be very good against Trump.
*07:04.880- 07:10.900* :  Dear President Biden, as we write this note, we know that some here even wrote President Biden
*07:10.900- 07:16.940* :  letters that they hope to deliver to his home. What do you think of Kamala Harris? I think that
*07:17.660- 07:23.360* :  she has been actively engaged in all aspects of the administration for the last three and a half
*07:23.360- 07:29.500* :  years. So I don't think there's anyone who could be better qualified. She is met with world leaders.
*07:29.500- 07:38.040* :  She has been out front on key issues. For some voters here, this decision feels very personal.
*07:38.300- 07:43.980* :  They might still need convincing about her. It's big for some of us. It's not just a presidential
*07:43.980- 07:48.300* :  election. It's how's the next four years of your life going to be like? My partner and I
*07:48.300- 07:52.320* :  worked gay couple and we've only had employment rights for what? Little over 10 years,
*07:52.900- 07:57.920* :  you know, getting protected from losing your job for who we are, who we had no choice in being.
*07:57.980- 08:03.700* :  We can get married, but a lot of those things can disappear just with a swipe of a pen.
*08:04.060- 08:09.480* :  And it's a lot of these things that people take for granted. Kamala, I want to hear more from her.
*08:09.820- 08:13.620* :  I want to hear what she has to say. She's been out there and doing her stuff and everything,
*08:13.620- 08:19.260* :  but I just haven't heard it enough. Some critics of the party feel it's too late.
*08:19.260- 08:22.580* :  The chaos of the last few weeks has already shown too much disunity.
*08:23.060- 08:28.720* :  For me, I'm not a fan. I think when you look at her history, you saw how she incriminated a lot of
*08:28.720- 08:32.580* :  people back in the day. You know, when they go back to Trump being racist and Trump this and
*08:32.580- 08:36.860* :  Trump that, but she also incriminated a lot of African-Americans. What I don't like on their
*08:36.860- 08:41.080* :  party right now is that they're inconsistent. They're 100 days out from an election. I think they
*08:41.080- 08:45.840* :  knew that Biden's center of reran, but they try to force it. And now here we are, you're 100 days
*08:45.900- 08:49.280* :  out. Now we've gotten some inconsistency and they got a scramble, whereas you look at the Republican
*08:49.280- 08:54.800* :  party right now, they're kind of ready to roll. And honestly, I'm a Republican, but I would like
*08:54.800- 09:00.020* :  to see fresh blood on both sides. These are just a handful of voters here in Delaware. Kamala Harris'
*09:00.020- 09:04.660* :  main test is now, if she can win over the whole country against the candidate Donald Trump,
*09:04.660- 09:08.560* :  whose supporters have been energized by the Democratic fallout these last few weeks.
*09:09.240- 09:14.720* :  I only wails in Delaware. There was a time when Brazil's president Luis
*09:14.720- 09:19.100* :  Ignacio Lula De Silva got on well with his Venezuelan counterpart Nicholas Maduro.
*09:19.500- 09:24.840* :  In a vowed socialist, the Venezuelan was an ideological soulmate. When he was accused of acting
*09:24.840- 09:31.620* :  like a dictator, Lula was there to defend him. But it seems President Maduro may now have gone too far.
*09:31.620- 09:37.780* :  He has said that were he to lose the upcoming presidential election, there could be a civil war
*09:37.780- 09:43.260* :  in Venezuela, resulting in a quote, bloodbath. In response, President Lula told him,
*09:43.260- 09:48.760* :  when you lose, you go home. His words are just one sign of how much is at stake in this election,
*09:49.220- 09:52.520* :  as a Latin America correspondent Will Grant told Paul Moss.
*09:53.400- 09:59.680* :  There is a good chance that the ruling party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela,
*09:59.700- 10:06.580* :  could lose and could lose by such a significant margin that it would be very difficult and complicated
*10:07.260- 10:12.620* :  to claim victory. And that element of doubt of what would happen if they lost by a significant
*10:12.620- 10:19.700* :  margin means that, obviously, there's real tension in Caracas about how things will unfold in
*10:19.700- 10:26.100* :  the immediate hours after the vote, the days after, the different actors involved from the opposition
*10:26.160- 10:32.640* :  through to the military. Mr. Maduro himself, all of these factors are sort of up in the air. But yes,
*10:32.640- 10:40.880* :  the unity candidate of Edmondo Gonzales, he really is showing a strong lead in the polls.
*10:40.900- 10:47.160* :  And so that is why this particular time, it's so important and so vital.
*10:47.660- 10:53.100* :  Now, Brazil's President Lula De Silva has always been a supporter of President Maduro.
*10:53.100- 10:58.640* :  Why is he now, apparently, giving a warning to President Maduro for his comments about
*10:58.640- 11:03.260* :  there being a bloodbath? Well, I think it is partly off the back of the comments themselves.
*11:03.260- 11:09.220* :  The specific language involved, Mr. Maduro said, if you don't want Venezuela to fall into a
*11:09.280- 11:15.200* :  bloodbath into a fratisidal civil war because of the fascists, let's ensure the greatest success.
*11:15.240- 11:21.780* :  So the very invoking of the image of civil war in Venezuela, a country which has always had
*11:21.780- 11:27.980* :  difficulties with political violence that is such a violent nation and has had so many issues
*11:27.980- 11:34.460* :  of polarity and polarization in its political process, he's seen that as what he called frightening.
*11:34.460- 11:41.820* :  And I think that reaction by Mr. Lula De Silva is important because he is this,
*11:41.820- 11:46.880* :  if you, as you've pointed out, a long-standing ally first of the late Venezuelan leader,
*11:46.880- 11:53.660* :  Oral Chavez, but also Mr. Maduro himself. So to suggest that Mr. Maduro needs to
*11:54.360- 11:58.580* :  respect the democratic process, to understand properly that if you win, you remain in power,
*11:58.580- 12:05.100* :  and if you lose, then you must step aside as Lula put it, is important and shows that even
*12:05.100- 12:11.480* :  allies in the region, like President Lula, are very, very concerned about the language and the
*12:11.480- 12:15.260* :  potential for violence in this race. Now that's an America correspondent will grant.
*12:16.340- 12:22.300* :  The South Korean technology giant Kakao is caught up in a huge scandal after its founder was
*12:22.300- 12:27.740* :  arrested on allegations of manipulating stock prices, relating to its takeover of the K-pop
*12:27.740- 12:34.520* :  agency SM Entertainment last year. Kim Boomsu denies the allegations with more on the firm and
*12:34.520- 12:39.880* :  it troubles his Nick Marsh. It actually did really well during the pandemic, like a lot of tech firms,
*12:39.880- 12:46.440* :  but they were left with a massive pile of cash. So they tried to take over SM Entertainment,
*12:46.440- 12:52.120* :  it's one of the really big K-pop labels. The problem was that there was also a rival bidder,
*12:52.280- 12:58.440* :  a company called Hai. So what Kim Boomsu, the chairman of Kakao, is accused of having done,
*12:58.440- 13:06.260* :  is artificially increasing the share price of SM Entertainment through manipulation and therefore
*13:06.260- 13:12.260* :  make it unaffordable for Haibe to try and buy. Now business reporter Nick Marsh
*13:14.700- 13:19.180* :  still to come on the global news podcast, the scandal surrounding a Japanese health supplement,
*13:19.180- 13:21.320* :  which may have led to dozens of deaths.
*13:32.020- 13:38.020* :  I'm James Reynolds from the Global Story Podcast. After weeks of pressure, US President Joe Biden
*13:38.020- 13:44.180* :  has dropped his bid for a second term. So will his Vice President Kamala Harris now lead
*13:44.180- 13:50.040* :  a United Democratic Party in November? And what does it mean for the Trump campaign?
*13:50.040- 13:55.280* :  The Global Story brings you unique perspectives from BBC journalists around the world,
*13:55.680- 13:57.740* :  find us wherever you get your podcasts.
*14:04.140- 14:09.420* :  Efforts to resolve the ongoing conflict in Gaza are complicated by bitter divisions between
*14:09.420- 14:15.240* :  the two main Palestinian factions, which have bubbled away ever since Hamas forced Fata out of
*14:15.240- 14:21.480* :  the territory in 2007. Now, China says that it has brokered a deal to get the two to work together
*14:21.480- 14:26.860* :  after the fighting between Israel and Hamas is over. At the same time Beijing is also hosting
*14:26.860- 14:32.300* :  the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Demetro Kulabah as part of China's efforts to present itself as
*14:32.300- 14:38.460* :  a mediator in Ukraine's war with Russia. Our correspondent in Beijing is Stephen McDonald. He
*14:38.460- 14:44.500* :  told me first about the Palestinian Agreement. Fourteen Palestinian factions, including Hamas and
*14:44.500- 14:49.940* :  Fata have come to Beijing. They've had discussions over four days and at the end have come up with
*14:49.940- 14:56.940* :  this agreement that's been known as the Beijing Declaration for ground sounding, which apparently
*14:56.980- 15:04.600* :  is designed to guarantee unity to make way for a sort of government of reconciliation to run
*15:04.600- 15:10.580* :  Gaza after the war there. Now, according to China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the crucial part of
*15:10.580- 15:16.820* :  this deal is that everybody agrees that the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the Peer Low,
*15:16.820- 15:23.560* :  is the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people. And I guess that they would be the
*15:23.560- 15:29.600* :  ones administering Gaza. What's not clear in this agreement, presuming it does hold together,
*15:29.600- 15:35.080* :  and that's by no means certain, what role does Hamas play there? There've been running Gaza
*15:35.440- 15:41.060* :  right up until the war that broke out following their attack on Israel last October. So are they
*15:41.060- 15:46.660* :  to have a role? Well, what role might they be? Well, none of that's clear. But I should remind people
*15:46.660- 15:52.300* :  that there have been many such attempts to bring these Palestinian factions together. They've all come
*15:52.300- 15:58.880* :  to nothing, including one broken by Egypt in 2017. So it could be that this one falls apart as well.
*15:59.260- 16:02.620* :  However, at the moment, according to the Chinese government and according to these
*16:03.060- 16:06.920* :  representatives of the factions, they're saying they've come up with this agreement so they can
*16:06.920- 16:14.560* :  come together in terms of deciding who will govern Gaza after the war. And why is China getting
*16:14.560- 16:21.140* :  involved in a question like that? It's interesting because, you know, for many years, China's catch
*16:21.140- 16:26.620* :  cry, if you like, is the people shouldn't be getting involved in others' internal affairs. And
*16:26.620- 16:30.480* :  they've especially done this because they don't like other countries criticizing China over human
*16:30.480- 16:35.240* :  rights and the like. And so it's been a bit standoffish when it comes to this type of thing. But
*16:35.240- 16:41.320* :  according to Wang Yi, China's foreign minister, he's saying, well, look at a certain time. He's
*16:41.320- 16:45.360* :  saying, look, this is up to the Palestinians, how they sort this out. We're just providing a
*16:45.360- 16:49.440* :  platform for it. We're not telling them how to do it. We're just saying that you can meet here and
*16:49.440- 16:55.120* :  we'll sort of organize the meeting still out to happen. But broadly speaking, Beijing does seem to
*16:55.120- 17:01.440* :  be attempting to show that it's a peacemaker on the world stage and a sort of representative of
*17:01.440- 17:07.460* :  the broader global South, if I could put it that way. And the biggest coup on this front was
*17:08.100- 17:14.940* :  when it was able to get Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore diplomatic relations. So these two
*17:14.940- 17:20.840* :  enemies that log heads for a long time, thanks to China, rest up as diplomatic relations,
*17:20.880- 17:27.140* :  and now it's trying the same thing on with the Palestinian factions and presenting itself,
*17:27.140- 17:32.360* :  it would seem as somebody who could do this in Ukraine, although that's a tougher proposition
*17:32.420- 17:39.480* :  for it, given that it really, it clearly, China's government clearly is a supporter of Russia in
*17:39.480- 17:45.820* :  that conflict. Are Beijing correspondent Steve McDonald? The two top bosses that a Japanese drug
*17:45.820- 17:50.460* :  maker have resigned after the firm said it was investigating dozens of deaths that could be linked
*17:50.460- 17:56.040* :  to its products. The pills in question contain red yeast rice, a type of mold meant to lower
*17:56.040- 18:01.600* :  cholesterol. I heard more from our Tokyo correspondent Shima Khalil. This is the latest development
*18:01.600- 18:08.660* :  in a big pharmaceutical scandals that involves a household name in Japan's pharmaceutical companies,
*18:08.660- 18:14.300* :  but also involves the top two names now that are hailing from the founding family, that
*18:14.300- 18:19.700* :  Skuzamasu Kobayashi, the chairman, and Akihiro Kobayashi, the president, both stepped down today,
*18:19.700- 18:26.020* :  and this resignation comes after the company released an independent report that has been done by
*18:26.020- 18:31.540* :  a team of external lawyers, and it came out regarding the health hazards and the deaths that you
*18:31.540- 18:37.180* :  mentioned involving the red yeast rice dietary supplements for cholesterol. And essentially this
*18:37.180- 18:45.340* :  report has said that the company failed to act with sufficient urgency and to alert the consumers
*18:45.340- 18:51.160* :  about the health and the risk, the health hazards and the risks of using the products, but also
*18:51.160- 18:56.880* :  they were late in recalling their Benikoji or the fermented rice supplement products. They
*18:56.880- 19:00.840* :  released them only in March, and the report said that they should have released them much earlier.
*19:01.000- 19:04.580* :  Yeah, are these popular products in Japan fermented rice?
*19:04.880- 19:10.660* :  Well, Kobayashi is a household name, and these particular products are popular among those who are
*19:10.660- 19:16.100* :  trying to get a handle on their cholesterol issues or blood pressure issues. And what we learned,
*19:16.100- 19:20.220* :  and this is the background to this is what happened earlier in March, where there were reports
*19:21.140- 19:27.100* :  to the company by customers about kidney problems that were linked to those who used the products.
*19:27.660- 19:33.200* :  What was found after that is that the company was actually aware of the of the problems by doctors
*19:34.160- 19:40.200* :  in mid-January and early February. And so the the damning report now says which holds the two
*19:40.200- 19:46.520* :  executives, the top executives responsible is that the company did not act fast enough and with enough
*19:46.520- 19:52.360* :  urgency to help consumers and to and to warn consumers. We're talking about dozens and dozens of
*19:52.660- 19:57.200* :  illnesses that are linked to kidney diseases, but also more than 100 deaths that are currently
*19:57.200- 20:01.700* :  being investigated. And what happens next, presumably they could be compensation claims?
*20:02.720- 20:08.320* :  Well, exactly. The investigation continues the number of deaths that are being investigated
*20:08.320- 20:13.460* :  with the link to those products continues. But as you say, there may be compensations involved.
*20:13.460- 20:19.220* :  We also understand that the senior executive director Satoshi Yamani is now taking over as
*20:19.220- 20:24.580* :  president. And this is the first time a person outside the company's founding family will serve
*20:24.580- 20:29.640* :  in this post. And of course, if this whole scandal harms the image of this household name
*20:30.220- 20:33.740* :  greatly as well as more details come out about this scandal.
*20:34.100- 20:39.440* :  Shai Ma, Helio in Tokyo. At least four police officers are to face prosecution over the
*20:39.440- 20:45.340* :  fatal shooting of protesters in Kenya. More than 50 people have been killed, dozens abducted
*20:45.340- 20:50.280* :  and hundreds more arrested in just over a month of demonstrations there. And as the BBC's Ann
*20:50.280- 20:56.020* :  Sawyer reports, the use of excessive force by the security agencies is fueling demands for change.
*21:01.940- 21:07.640* :  This is not a war zone. It's Kenyan Police doing crowd control. Some of the sounds of
*21:07.640- 21:13.000* :  explosions are from tear gas canisters, but they've also used rubber bullets and live ammunition to
*21:13.000- 21:21.640* :  aquel protests. Thousands of mostly young, unarmed protesters have been on the streets almost
*21:21.640- 21:28.000* :  every Tuesday and Thursday for weeks now. At first, they wanted the government to drop proposed
*21:28.000- 21:38.360* :  tax hikes. It did. But the protests continued. They now want the president and his government to
*21:38.820- 21:43.620* :  resign. And in its place, they demand for a reformed administration free of corruption.
*21:46.900- 21:53.040* :  In these confrontations with police, dozens have been killed. 29-year-old Rex Masai was the
*21:53.040- 21:58.980* :  first victim. We met his mother at the city mortuary a day after Rex was shot and killed by police.
*22:00.820- 22:06.580* :  He was respectful when people are fighting for their rights. Why use live bullets? If he had been
*22:06.580- 22:12.200* :  armed, we would understand that perhaps he was on the wrong, but he was only walking with his friends.
*22:18.960- 22:23.900* :  A video showing a man in civilian clothes chasing a crowd and firing a gun at them was
*22:23.900- 22:31.560* :  published on social media. It is said to be the moment Rex was killed. His friend Ian Jiguna was with
*22:31.620- 22:37.040* :  him. It was shocking. His blood was all over my hands. When we got close to a hospital, the
*22:37.040- 22:41.800* :  officer tear gased us, yet we were carrying our dying friend. What message would you like to give
*22:41.800- 22:48.100* :  to government? Stop using force. Listen to the youth. You are not listening to us. We are tired.
*22:48.660- 22:53.400* :  If you have dreadlocks, you are treated like a criminal. So do you think Rex was profiled because
*22:53.400- 22:59.380* :  of his locks? Yes, actually he was accused of stealing a phone. So they shot him because of what
*22:59.460- 23:06.040* :  dreadlocks. Whilst we were outside the mortuary, there was a disturbing discovery. The bullet that
*23:06.040- 23:11.060* :  caused Rex to bleed to his death had been confirmed to be lodged in his thigh by the doctor
*23:11.060- 23:16.120* :  who pronounced him dead. All of a sudden, they are claiming it's not there. How come?
*23:16.380- 23:21.040* :  A commissioner of the body mandated with investigating claims against the police was not surprised
*23:21.040- 23:27.200* :  by this development. John Weiganjo said the police oversight authority had also run into challenges
*23:27.200- 23:33.100* :  trying to obtain evidence. When we are investigating, say, a serious injury or death,
*23:33.620- 23:39.860* :  we need to know where the guns are from. We need the arms movement register. We need to know
*23:40.340- 23:45.680* :  which members were in a particular platoon. I asked the acting Inspector General of Police for
*23:45.680- 23:50.740* :  an interview to respond to these allegations. He instructed the agency's spokesperson to provide
*23:50.740- 23:55.960* :  the answers about a week ago. But despite sending specific questions to the office and multiple
*23:55.960- 24:01.540* :  reminders, since then, no answers have been provided. Amnesty Kenya's executive director,
*24:01.540- 24:07.460* :  Irungu Houghton, says the culture of impunity is deeply entrenched within Kenya's police service.
*24:08.060- 24:13.220* :  I mean, the first person to fall in the protest was Rex Masai, a young man,
*24:13.820- 24:18.100* :  according by all accounts, a nonviolent person, not somebody who has any criminal records.
*24:19.140- 24:24.420* :  And he was shot, essentially unarmed. It is not justified to use life fire or even
*24:24.840- 24:30.660* :  rubber bullets on people who are unarmed and essentially not confronting the police violently.
*24:30.920- 24:35.820* :  So the laws are not the problem. I think what is problematic is the culture of policing
*24:35.820- 24:39.200* :  in a context where there is confrontation with the public.
*24:44.560- 24:50.540* :  What the excessive force has done is fuel more anger and unrest. The protesters are unrelenting.
*24:51.160- 24:56.360* :  They want change. They demand for justice for their fallen compatriots and want impunity
*24:56.360- 25:04.840* :  to end. They won't kill us all, they say. And so it reporting from Nairobi.
*25:05.900- 25:11.360* :  More than six decades after Barbie first hit the shelves, the Toymaker Metall is breaking new ground
*25:11.360- 25:17.160* :  launching the first blind version. It already makes other diverse dolls as David Lewis explains.
*25:17.960- 25:22.500* :  The newly released Blind Barbie carries a red and white cane with a marshmallow tip.
*25:22.500- 25:28.760* :  She sports dark glasses too. Undershades her eyes look slightly up and out to reflect some
*25:28.760- 25:34.400* :  blind people's gaze. Her clothing will be made from textured and vibrant fabrics different to
*25:34.400- 25:39.800* :  touch. Even the packaging is updated. Barbie will be spelt out in braille on the box.
*25:40.500- 25:45.580* :  Work went into making this latest iteration authentic but keeping the toy tasteful.
*25:45.980- 25:51.100* :  Mattel partnered with Blind Charities in the US and Britain to design the new doll.
*25:51.700- 25:56.180* :  Brockastro and Disability Activist Lucie Edwards is a blind Barbie ambassador.
*25:56.700- 26:00.360* :  She told the BBC why the new figurine was important to her.
*26:00.900- 26:05.600* :  I always say, I lost my eyesight but I didn't lose my vision and when I conjured different
*26:05.600- 26:11.860* :  pictures in my mind, I think that's why it's so important that when Blind Barbie had her
*26:11.860- 26:17.280* :  consultancy kind of cool and we're all developing how close it's like it was so important to have
*26:17.280- 26:21.240* :  that like Rar Raskar that was just so textured and it's kind of like my dress today actually.
*26:21.340- 26:26.880* :  Yeah it's really great. The new model is the latest of Mattel's Barbie Fashionistas range.
*26:26.880- 26:35.160* :  Products include dolls with 35 skin tones, 97 hairstyles and 9 body types. Blind Barbie follows
*26:35.160- 26:41.360* :  deaf Barbie, a version in a wheelchair and a toy with a prosthetic limb. Last year the first ever
*26:41.360- 26:46.200* :  Barbie with Down syndrome was launched and was well received. David Lewis.
*26:49.080- 26:52.700* :  And that is all from us for now but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*26:52.700- 26:56.080* :  This edition was mixed by Nikki Bruff and produced by Oliver Burlow.
*26:56.080- 26:59.740* :  Our editors Karen Martin, I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
*27:08.880- 27:13.500* :  I'm James Reynolds from the Global Story Podcast. After weeks of pressure,
*27:13.500- 27:19.740* :  US President Joe Biden has dropped his bid for a second term. So will his vice president,
*27:19.740- 27:26.000* :  Carmelo Harris now lead a United Democratic Party in November? And what does it mean for the
*27:26.000- 27:31.680* :  Trump campaign? The Global Story brings you unique perspectives from BBC journalists around
*27:31.680- 27:34.560* :  the world. Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
