*01:06.240- 01:07.460* :  from the BBC World Service.
*01:09.960- 01:11.160* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:11.160- 01:13.460* :  We are recording this at 13 hours GMT
*01:13.460- 01:15.400* :  on Thursday the 25th of July.
*01:15.400- 01:18.720* :  The effects of typhoon Gemi are being felt across Asia.
*01:19.160- 01:20.820* :  It's making landfall in China
*01:21.060- 01:21.740* :  while the Philippines
*01:21.740- 01:24.100* :  is trying to contain a massive oil spill.
*01:24.980- 01:26.660* :  Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu
*01:26.660- 01:28.580* :  are to meet in Washington with
*01:28.580- 01:30.500* :  pressure building for a hostage deal.
*01:30.960- 01:32.280* :  The Israeli army has recovered
*01:32.280- 01:34.180* :  another five bodies from Gaza,
*01:34.900- 01:36.520* :  and accusations that Sudan's
*01:36.520- 01:38.360* :  bloody civil war is being fueled
*01:38.400- 01:40.120* :  by the illegal trade in weapons.
*01:43.400- 01:44.580* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:44.760- 01:46.500* :  a day ahead of the games we take a look
*01:46.500- 01:48.920* :  inside the Olympic village in Paris.
*01:49.580- 01:51.780* :  And black soldier flies are an insect
*01:51.780- 01:53.720* :  that is increasingly being used
*01:53.820- 01:55.300* :  on industrial skills
*01:55.300- 01:58.220* :  to as an alternative for waste management.
*01:58.560- 02:01.400* :  How a fly could help reduce methane emissions.
*02:06.760- 02:08.440* :  But we start in East Asia
*02:08.440- 02:11.480* :  where typhoon Gemi continues to wreak havoc.
*02:12.060- 02:13.340* :  As we record this podcast,
*02:13.340- 02:16.020* :  it is starting to make landfall in southern China
*02:16.020- 02:19.760* :  where 150,000 people have already been evacuated.
*02:20.380- 02:23.100* :  The Philippines had avoided a direct hit,
*02:23.540- 02:25.360* :  but the storm did trigger heavy rains
*02:25.360- 02:26.460* :  earlier in the week,
*02:26.520- 02:28.100* :  and 20 people there died.
*02:28.820- 02:30.100* :  Today, though, the Philippine government
*02:30.100- 02:32.920* :  is facing the threat of an environmental catastrophe
*02:33.580- 02:36.000* :  after an oil tanker sank in heavy seas.
*02:36.540- 02:38.680* :  The vessel was carrying close to one and a half million
*02:38.680- 02:41.220* :  litres of industrial fuel when it capsized
*02:41.220- 02:42.360* :  in Manila Bay,
*02:42.360- 02:45.280* :  a huge natural harbor centred on the Philippine capital.
*02:45.860- 02:46.840* :  One of the crew died,
*02:46.840- 02:48.940* :  the remaining 16 were rescued.
*02:49.540- 02:51.140* :  The authorities are racing against time
*02:51.140- 02:53.800* :  to contain an oil slick nearly four kilometres long.
*02:53.800- 02:56.740* :  Our Asia-Pacific Regional Editor, Celia Hatton,
*02:56.800- 02:57.640* :  told me what happened.
*02:58.220- 03:01.480* :  I've just read an account by some of the crew members
*03:01.480- 03:05.020* :  who were rescued from the capsized tanker,
*03:05.020- 03:05.920* :  the Terra Nova.
*03:06.580- 03:08.260* :  They say that they had set sail
*03:08.260- 03:10.880* :  from one part of Manila Bay in rough water,
*03:10.880- 03:12.640* :  but not actually violating any rules.
*03:12.640- 03:15.340* :  There was no Coast Guard rule in place
*03:15.380- 03:17.200* :  to stop them from sailing at the time,
*03:17.200- 03:19.160* :  so they set on their way,
*03:19.640- 03:20.740* :  but then they realised,
*03:20.740- 03:23.560* :  the captain realised that the water was just too rough
*03:23.960- 03:24.880* :  for them to continue.
*03:24.980- 03:26.580* :  So they tried to turn back
*03:26.960- 03:28.560* :  and that's when they really got into trouble
*03:28.560- 03:31.480* :  because they were going against massive waves
*03:31.480- 03:33.720* :  and as the crew members describe it,
*03:33.720- 03:35.200* :  they were scooping waves,
*03:35.200- 03:36.560* :  taking on lots of water
*03:36.700- 03:38.860* :  and that's when the tanker capsized.
*03:39.300- 03:40.560* :  They issued a distress call
*03:40.560- 03:43.300* :  and actually the Coast Guard were there within five minutes,
*03:43.300- 03:44.740* :  which is quite remarkable
*03:44.740- 03:46.400* :  considering how bad the weather was,
*03:46.820- 03:49.120* :  but the ship had already sunk.
*03:49.140- 03:50.700* :  It was quite an old ship.
*03:50.740- 03:52.500* :  It was made in 2002,
*03:52.500- 03:56.520* :  so it's near the end of its expected 30-year life.
*03:56.580- 03:58.500* :  So I think that didn't help matters at all,
*03:58.560- 04:00.020* :  but now rescuers,
*04:00.020- 04:01.720* :  they've rescued most of the crew members,
*04:01.720- 04:03.420* :  but they're really focusing now,
*04:03.420- 04:06.540* :  as you say, on the size of that oil spill,
*04:06.540- 04:07.800* :  which is quite difficult to do
*04:08.100- 04:10.200* :  because the waters are still quite choppy
*04:10.200- 04:12.940* :  around waves around three to four metres high.
*04:13.220- 04:14.460* :  Yeah, what can they do?
*04:14.720- 04:17.860* :  There's some suggestion that if all the oil leaks out,
*04:17.860- 04:19.860* :  it'll be the worst to affect the Philippines.
*04:20.360- 04:20.780* :  Absolutely.
*04:20.780- 04:24.240* :  I mean, I just watched a recording of a meeting
*04:24.240- 04:26.180* :  that was recently held, a cabinet meeting
*04:26.180- 04:27.700* :  just in the past few hours,
*04:28.580- 04:30.400* :  where Ferdinand Marcos Jr.,
*04:30.440- 04:31.320* :  the president of the Philippines,
*04:31.320- 04:33.700* :  was sitting at a table with his cabinet around him.
*04:34.020- 04:36.380* :  And you can see the transportation minister
*04:36.880- 04:40.360* :  who is informing Mr. Marcos Jr. about this spill.
*04:40.580- 04:43.920* :  And as the details of this spill become clear,
*04:43.920- 04:46.460* :  the fact that it's happened in Manila Bay,
*04:46.460- 04:48.140* :  the size of the tanker,
*04:48.440- 04:51.760* :  you can see the president put his head in his hands
*04:51.760- 04:53.660* :  and just shake his head
*04:53.660- 04:56.300* :  because he's realizing the depths
*04:56.300- 04:58.800* :  of how bad this really could be.
*04:58.980- 05:02.500* :  It's now 1,494 metric tons,
*05:04.160- 05:06.920* :  carrying the vessels there.
*05:07.600- 05:10.900* :  So it got sized at one o'clock early this morning,
*05:11.440- 05:13.580* :  and there is already oil spill.
*05:14.660- 05:21.040* :  And right now, we cannot dispatch our resources
*05:21.860- 05:25.080* :  because of strong winds and high waves.
*05:26.280- 05:28.520* :  We know that they've sent out aerial crews
*05:28.520- 05:30.800* :  to assess the size of this spill.
*05:31.280- 05:32.380* :  And I think at this point,
*05:32.380- 05:34.240* :  they're really hoping that what happens now
*05:34.680- 05:36.300* :  is something that happened 20 years ago
*05:36.300- 05:38.620* :  in the Philippines when a similar tanker sank,
*05:39.020- 05:41.180* :  but only one of the 10 compartments leaked.
*05:41.220- 05:43.300* :  And I think they're really just wondering now,
*05:43.300- 05:45.620* :  how bad is this leak so far?
*05:45.620- 05:49.140* :  How much of the oil is going to leak out of this ship?
*05:49.540- 05:52.120* :  I Asia-Pacific Regional Editor, Celia Hatton.
*05:52.680- 05:55.200* :  After skimming the Philippines typhoon Gemi
*05:55.340- 05:57.320* :  plowed across Taiwan yesterday,
*05:57.320- 05:59.800* :  at least three people died on the island,
*05:59.800- 06:03.200* :  while some Burmese sailors are missing offshore.
*06:03.920- 06:07.040* :  Reporter Jan Kamazind Brumbe gave us this update
*06:07.040- 06:08.460* :  from the Taiwanese capital.
*06:08.860- 06:12.820* :  The impact in Taipei has thankfully been relatively small.
*06:12.820- 06:14.960* :  You walk around the streets are far emptier
*06:14.960- 06:15.700* :  than you would imagine.
*06:15.980- 06:17.740* :  They're having what's called a typhoon day.
*06:17.740- 06:19.740* :  That means schools are closed, shops are closed,
*06:19.740- 06:21.520* :  businesses are largely closed,
*06:21.520- 06:22.800* :  although some have remained open.
*06:23.220- 06:24.860* :  You can see people have boarded up their windows
*06:24.860- 06:27.120* :  to protect them from any kind of damage.
*06:27.120- 06:30.320* :  But the real focus now is shifting away from Taipei
*06:30.320- 06:31.880* :  and it's shifting down towards the south
*06:31.880- 06:34.180* :  and towards the east of Taiwan's island.
*06:34.640- 06:37.280* :  There we've seen significant levels of rainwater
*06:37.280- 06:40.020* :  and flooding even in the city of Galshung in the south.
*06:40.260- 06:43.740* :  Social media video showing water flooding down into car parks
*06:43.740- 06:45.660* :  and people trudging through the streets
*06:45.660- 06:46.800* :  that once were filled with cars,
*06:46.800- 06:48.860* :  now filled with flood water.
*06:49.320- 06:52.340* :  And there has been a ship that we believe has gone
*06:52.880- 06:56.140* :  has sunk essentially with nine Myanmar nationals on board.
*06:56.540- 06:58.520* :  Those nationals missing haven't been heard
*06:58.520- 07:00.560* :  from since the distressing of the base sent out.
*07:00.880- 07:03.240* :  Three other ships also run aground off the coast
*07:03.700- 07:05.200* :  off the southern coast of Taiwan
*07:06.000- 07:07.760* :  and hope some of the local coast guard
*07:07.780- 07:09.780* :  and local governments that they will be able to rescue
*07:09.780- 07:11.600* :  the people on those ships very soon.
*07:12.220- 07:14.360* :  Jan Kamazin, Brumby in Taipei
*07:14.540- 07:15.740* :  and in the past few minutes,
*07:15.740- 07:19.020* :  Taiwan's coast guard has said that three crew members
*07:19.020- 07:22.000* :  of the nine missing after cargo ship capsized
*07:22.460- 07:24.020* :  have been found alive.
*07:25.340- 07:27.140* :  As you may have heard on the previous edition
*07:27.140- 07:28.460* :  of the Global News podcast,
*07:28.460- 07:31.920* :  there was a mixed reaction to Benjamin Netanyahu's address
*07:31.920- 07:34.140* :  to the joint houses of the U.S. Congress.
*07:34.180- 07:37.300* :  The Israeli Prime Minister will today hold talks
*07:37.300- 07:40.520* :  with President Biden as he tries to rally American support
*07:40.520- 07:42.440* :  for Israel's war against Hamas.
*07:42.880- 07:45.140* :  The U.S.-Israeli alliance has become strained
*07:45.140- 07:47.320* :  by the huge numbers of deaths in Gaza
*07:47.760- 07:50.320* :  and delays in securing the release of hostages.
*07:50.320- 07:53.940* :  The two leaders will discuss the remaining obstacles to a deal
*07:54.460- 07:56.900* :  and meet families of American captives.
*07:57.400- 08:00.840* :  Back in Israel, hostage families condemned Mr Netanyahu's speech
*08:00.840- 08:03.340* :  as it was broadcast in a square in Tel Aviv.
*08:04.060- 08:06.140* :  Shortly after the Israeli army announced
*08:06.160- 08:09.680* :  it had recovered the bodies of five Israelis in Gaza.
*08:09.940- 08:12.020* :  I heard more from Barbara Blatasha in Jerusalem.
*08:12.820- 08:15.400* :  Four of them are soldiers who were killed
*08:15.400- 08:17.980* :  during the October 7th Hamas attack
*08:17.980- 08:19.880* :  and their bodies were taken into Gaza.
*08:20.520- 08:22.740* :  One of them is the body of a civilian, a woman,
*08:22.740- 08:25.360* :  Mayagoren, who died in captivity.
*08:25.360- 08:26.360* :  It was known that.
*08:26.400- 08:28.220* :  That was announced back in December.
*08:28.920- 08:33.200* :  So now the bodies have all been found in Hanyunis
*08:33.280- 08:35.300* :  in southern Israel where the Israeli military
*08:35.300- 08:39.120* :  is currently going carrying out an operation against Hamas
*08:39.240- 08:42.080* :  and they have then announced that they have the bodies
*08:42.080- 08:44.340* :  and have brought them back into Israel.
*08:44.340- 08:46.260* :  Again, a reminder to the hostage families
*08:46.260- 08:48.800* :  or the families of the hostages that time is ticking
*08:49.280- 08:51.300* :  and that their own loved ones could meet the same fate
*08:51.300- 08:54.500* :  and that was very much, very much the sense I got
*08:54.500- 08:56.300* :  when I was in Tel Aviv during the speech
*08:56.300- 08:59.480* :  with the families while it was going on.
*08:59.500- 09:02.860* :  They were extremely frustrated that Mr Netanyahu did not
*09:02.860- 09:06.000* :  give any concrete information about a possible ceasefire
*09:06.000- 09:07.240* :  deal to bring the hostages home.
*09:07.540- 09:09.780* :  Yeah, I mean, they have been putting huge pressure
*09:10.160- 09:14.060* :  on Benjamin Netanyahu but it seems he doesn't appear
*09:14.060- 09:15.200* :  to be responding to that.
*09:18.140- 09:19.300* :  Well, he hasn't been.
*09:19.340- 09:23.080* :  He has been announcing all along that it's military pressure
*09:23.120- 09:24.800* :  on Hamas that will make the difference
*09:24.800- 09:28.240* :  and he kept saying that even as he arrived in Washington
*09:28.920- 09:31.140* :  but he has shown some softening.
*09:31.140- 09:32.940* :  He said that the conditions are ripening
*09:32.940- 09:34.220* :  but they're not mature yet.
*09:34.800- 09:37.320* :  He did hint at some flexibility in negotiations
*09:37.440- 09:38.240* :  during his speech.
*09:38.240- 09:41.200* :  He didn't actually say that Hamas had to be destroyed
*09:41.200- 09:42.740* :  in his speech but you're kind of picking
*09:42.740- 09:44.600* :  through bits and pieces there.
*09:44.600- 09:46.940* :  You're not getting a clear answer on what you want to hear.
*09:46.940- 09:49.440* :  If you're a Palestinian who wants the fighting to stop
*09:49.440- 09:52.900* :  and if you're a family member who wants the fighting to stop,
*09:52.900- 09:55.480* :  we know that the negotiations have been proceeding
*09:56.200- 09:57.040* :  better than before.
*09:57.040- 09:59.480* :  They are at a more advanced stage than they have been before.
*09:59.480- 10:02.520* :  There are still some gaps but there's a widespread perception
*10:02.520- 10:04.180* :  not just from the hostage families
*10:04.580- 10:06.740* :  that it is Mr. Netanyahu that has been delaying them
*10:07.080- 10:09.380* :  for his own political reasons than if he signed off
*10:09.400- 10:11.560* :  on what was agreed it could happen quite quickly.
*10:12.040- 10:13.860* :  Barbara, Platt, Usher in Jerusalem.
*10:14.580- 10:17.600* :  Well, it was a busy evening in Washington last night
*10:17.600- 10:21.220* :  with President Biden giving a TV address from the Oval Office,
*10:21.220- 10:23.560* :  claiming he stepped down from the presidential race
*10:23.560- 10:25.940* :  to quote, save American democracy.
*10:25.940- 10:29.540* :  He also said it was time to hand over to a new generation.
*10:29.540- 10:32.640* :  His decision to quit means it will be Kamala Harris,
*10:32.640- 10:36.620* :  currently 59, who takes on the 78-year-old Donald Trump
*10:36.960- 10:38.120* :  in November's election.
*10:38.860- 10:42.440* :  Mr. Biden praised his vice president as a tough and capable leader
*10:42.440- 10:45.340* :  but at a campaign rally Donald Trump attacked both of them
*10:45.580- 10:46.740* :  this report from Will Grant.
*10:47.500- 10:51.120* :  In a speech no sitting president has delivered in more than half a century,
*10:51.620- 10:54.300* :  Joe Biden confirmed his decision to drop out of the race
*10:54.320- 10:55.420* :  to the American people.
*10:55.860- 10:57.220* :  It was time for new voices.
*10:57.740- 11:00.160* :  And yes, he acknowledged younger voices.
*11:00.740- 11:02.260* :  I've decided the best way forward
*11:02.600- 11:04.420* :  is to pass the torch to a new generation.
*11:05.100- 11:06.500* :  It's the best way to unite our nation.
*11:08.400- 11:10.320* :  Nothing could get in the way of saving democracy
*11:10.320- 11:13.100* :  said President Biden, including personal ambition.
*11:13.660- 11:15.360* :  He painted in November's vote as a choice
*11:15.360- 11:19.700* :  between forwards or back, hope or hate, unity or division.
*11:20.240- 11:22.900* :  Despite Republicans calling for him to resign the presidency,
*11:22.900- 11:26.100* :  Mr. Biden said he had no intention of stepping aside.
*11:26.620- 11:30.100* :  On the next six months, I'll be focused on doing my job as president.
*11:30.640- 11:33.140* :  That means I'll continue to lower costs for hard working families,
*11:33.900- 11:34.740* :  grow our economy.
*11:35.360- 11:37.940* :  I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights
*11:38.480- 11:40.220* :  from the right to vote to the right to choose.
*11:42.420- 11:46.660* :  It's just a month since his make or break presidential debate with Donald Trump.
*11:46.660- 11:49.800* :  His halting at times garbled performance
*11:49.840- 11:51.720* :  a moment he never came back from.
*11:52.320- 11:55.140* :  Now it's almost certain the person he's passing that torch to
*11:55.140- 11:57.220* :  is his vice president, Kamala Harris.
*12:05.520- 12:07.640* :  Her campaign has gone from strength to strength,
*12:07.640- 12:10.580* :  generating tens of millions of dollars in record time
*12:11.120- 12:13.260* :  and has energized a despondent base.
*12:13.780- 12:15.760* :  She even seems to have settled on a slogan.
*12:16.220- 12:17.840* :  We are not going back.
*12:22.100- 12:25.540* :  Many of those watching weren't alive the last time a US president did this.
*12:25.960- 12:29.860* :  In 1968, Lyndon Johnson moved aside only to see the Republican
*12:29.860- 12:32.920* :  challenger, Richard Nixon, ultimately win the presidency.
*12:33.780- 12:37.340* :  Mr. Biden will hope that history won't be repeating itself with Donald Trump.
*12:38.520- 12:41.680* :  In North Carolina, the Republican candidate dropped the short-lived
*12:41.680- 12:45.060* :  unifying tone of his campaign, turning on both the president
*12:45.060- 12:47.340* :  and his new presumptive rival alike.
*12:47.960- 12:52.040* :  We officially defeated the worst president in the history of our country.
*12:52.500- 12:53.360* :  Purgatio Biden.
*12:56.780- 12:58.060* :  For three and a half years,
*12:58.060- 13:02.260* :  Lion Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force
*13:02.260- 13:05.380* :  behind every single Biden catastrophe.
*13:06.420- 13:09.880* :  She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country
*13:11.000- 13:14.660* :  if she ever gets the chance to get into office when I can let that happen.
*13:18.840- 13:20.820* :  Politics is all Mr. Biden has ever known,
*13:20.820- 13:24.800* :  a career which has spanned five decades from, as he put it,
*13:24.800- 13:27.900* :  a kid with a stutter from Scranton to the White House.
*13:28.720- 13:30.640* :  This decision will define his legacy.
*13:31.240- 13:34.320* :  November's vote will define whether that gamble has worked.
*13:35.440- 13:36.920* :  A report by Will Grant.
*13:37.960- 13:42.400* :  A change of pace now and Australian scientists have genetically engineered
*13:42.400- 13:46.680* :  flies to consume more organic waste, potentially reducing methane emissions
*13:47.160- 13:50.260* :  and creating byproducts like biofuels and animal feed.
*13:50.820- 13:54.360* :  The researchers hope to deploy these modified black soldier flies
*13:54.360- 13:56.340* :  in waste facilities by the end of the year.
*13:56.980- 14:01.600* :  Dr. Matt Chek Maselko runs an animal synthetic biology lab at Macquarie University.
*14:01.980- 14:04.140* :  He told Andrew Peach how this works.
*14:04.900- 14:09.880* :  Black soldier flies are an insect that is increasingly being used on industrial skills
*14:09.940- 14:12.780* :  to as an alternative for waste management.
*14:12.780- 14:19.500* :  So hundreds of tons of waste are being taken to these facilities fed to the maggots
*14:19.500- 14:23.960* :  from these insects and then that's being processed into, say, animal feeding ingredients.
*14:24.380- 14:27.980* :  What we're interested in doing is genetically modifying these insects
*14:27.980- 14:32.080* :  to greatly expand the waste feedstocks that they can be reared on
*14:32.420- 14:35.600* :  and then also expand the variety of products that they can make,
*14:35.600- 14:40.100* :  including things like industrial enzymes for textile industry or say wastewater treatment.
*14:40.560- 14:45.020* :  How do you genetically modify the flies and so many of them?
*14:45.140- 14:49.220* :  We collect the embryos from these flies and then we have these really tiny glass
*14:49.220- 14:55.480* :  needles that we make in our laboratory and we inject a mixture of DNA into those embryos
*14:55.960- 15:02.940* :  and then when those embryos grow up, we screen for the insects that have incorporated that DNA
*15:03.480- 15:07.860* :  into their own DNA and then we'll pass that down into subsequent generations.
*15:08.000- 15:12.660* :  So we don't need to be genetically engineering every single insect that's going to be doing
*15:12.660- 15:18.400* :  something for us. We establish a strain that has this new genetic component and then
*15:18.400- 15:22.200* :  that can be greatly expanded to an industrial scale.
*15:22.360- 15:27.320* :  And will these flies have to then be integrated into an existing ecosystem?
*15:27.440- 15:30.880* :  Because you're talking about such vast numbers of them that would have a huge impact.
*15:31.420- 15:34.440* :  These aren't flies that'll be ever released into the wild.
*15:34.440- 15:40.340* :  The idea is that they'll be used by these companies that already have really massive
*15:40.340- 15:45.340* :  facilities and the numbers are quite staggering. There's facilities coming online that are going
*15:45.340- 15:51.880* :  to be producing 60,000 metric tons of animal feed protein every year and 20,000 metric tons
*15:52.220- 15:57.320* :  of oils from these flies and so this is all in an enclosed facility so they're just accepting
*15:57.320- 16:03.420* :  a variety of waste rearing these insects on that and then those proteins and oils are extracted
*16:03.780- 16:05.800* :  from them. Dr. Matt Check-Maselco.
*16:08.380- 16:10.340* :  And still to come on the Global News podcast?
*16:11.080- 16:13.620* :  Leave it to the French to spare no details.
*16:13.620- 16:17.900* :  Specifically when it comes to the food in fact I'm standing out front of the gym this morning
*16:17.900- 16:21.280* :  because I've eaten so many baguettes and cheese already in my stay here.
*16:21.720- 16:24.520* :  We take a look inside the Olympic village in Paris.
*16:33.480- 16:40.320* :  This season Instacart has your back to school. As in they've got your back to school lunch favorites
*16:40.320- 16:45.520* :  like snack packs and fresh fruit and they've got your back to school supplies like back packs,
*16:45.520- 16:52.540* :  binders and pencils and they've got your back when your kid casually tells you they have a huge
*16:52.540- 17:00.400* :  school project to do tomorrow. Let's face it we were all that kid. So first call your parents to
*17:00.400- 17:06.400* :  say I'm sorry and then download the Instacart app to get delivery in as fast as 30 minutes

*17:12.000- 17:18.180* :  last. Minimum $10 in order, additional term supply. Ryan Reynolds here for I guess my hundreds
*17:18.180- 17:22.980* :  mid commercial. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know, honestly when I
*17:22.980- 17:27.120* :  started this I thought I'd only have to do like four of these. I mean it's unlimited premium wireless
*17:27.120- 17:32.840* :  for $15 a month. How are there still people paying two or three times that much? I'm sorry I
*17:32.840- 17:38.000* :  shouldn't be victim blaming here. Give it a try at midmobile.com slash switch whatever you're ready.
*17:38.360- 17:42.740* :  $45 up from payment equivalent to $15 per month. New customers on first three month plan only.
*17:42.740- 17:45.620* :  Taxes and fees extra speed slower about 40 gigabyte CT tails.
*17:50.680- 17:56.620* :  Over the past year the battlefield in Ukraine has been transformed by drones targeting both
*17:56.620- 18:03.380* :  individual soldiers and armored vehicles. Russia has a six to one advantage in sheer numbers but
*18:03.380- 18:08.440* :  Ukraine claims to have the technological edge. It is aiming to produce a million attack and
*18:08.440- 18:13.180* :  surveillance drones this year alone on the battlefield vehicles and even individual soldiers
*18:13.180- 18:18.280* :  carried detection and jamming equipment. Our correspondent Quentin Somerville has spent the past
*18:18.280- 18:27.500* :  few weeks on the front line. So the drone detector in the car is beeping and it looks like it has
*18:27.500- 18:32.900* :  multiple signals. You have any what's happening with the drone detector? The drone detector has
*18:32.900- 18:40.220* :  got Zala and Lancer drone. Is that why we're driving fast? Yes as when to stand it the Lancer is
*18:40.220- 18:45.920* :  a very dangerous thing but it works in tandem with Zala and it's hard for them to catch us at speed.
*18:46.500- 18:50.020* :  We're not a priority target for them but it's still better not to stop.
*18:50.800- 18:56.360* :  The drone unseen from above follows the route we are taking so the main head for an infantry
*18:56.360- 19:03.900* :  trench which offers better cover. Both sides in this war are using FPV first-person view drones
*19:03.900- 19:13.040* :  which operate as fly manually. The small, cheap and deadly. The men are squirreled away in this tiny
*19:13.040- 19:21.080* :  little wooded corpse. It doesn't give a lot of protection but because it's summer the growth
*19:21.080- 19:26.320* :  is pretty thick and it's enough to hide them from from drones so when we were dropped off the
*19:26.320- 19:31.440* :  car dropped us off very quickly and spread away they're really pretty careful here about not
*19:31.660- 19:36.500* :  revealing their positions to the Russians because it wouldn't take much from one of these FPV
*19:36.500- 19:44.120* :  drones to make its way directly onto this position with lethal accuracy. And then we hear it!
*19:52.280- 19:57.360* :  Okay everybody just stopped and staring silently at this guy because we can hear drone above us.
*20:02.420- 20:07.700* :  So that drone we held has passed overhead so we need to get out of here fast.
*20:16.480- 20:21.660* :  In the shattered village of Lipsy just 10 kilometers from the Russian border I made one of the
*20:21.660- 20:30.880* :  13th Hartieu Brigade's drone attack teams. They worked from under the ruins of the village's
*20:30.880- 20:37.580* :  destroyed buildings and operate close to Russian positions in range of mortars so spend as little
*20:37.580- 20:43.900* :  time as possible in the open. Okay almost there's the petrol.
*20:49.640- 20:50.700* :  So where's the 12th vessel?
*20:52.840- 20:56.660* :  There are drones everywhere here on every surface cardboard box who's full of them.
*20:58.300- 21:04.000* :  Robin modified I mean the reasons there are so many is because a lot of these are single use
*21:04.000- 21:09.560* :  kamikaze drones they're flown by the pilots towards a target usually Russian infantry sometimes
*21:09.560- 21:15.480* :  they fly in buildings and through windows and detonate when they see that target.
*21:17.400- 21:21.460* :  It's remarkable at the beginning of this war you'd see the occasional drone but now there are
*21:21.460- 21:28.760* :  these drone factories really which are just producing these munitions at an incredible rate.
*21:29.840- 21:35.000* :  Here in the darkness on Ukraine's battlefields the rules of war are being rewritten.
*21:35.840- 21:41.640* :  It's the first conflict to use drones on this scale and it's a glimpse into a bleak future
*21:42.400- 21:44.420* :  where all wars will be fought like this.
*21:49.260- 21:55.640* :  Quentin Somerville reporting from Ukraine. The conflict in Sudan is being fueled by a constant
*21:55.640- 22:00.200* :  flow of weapons according to a new report from the rights group Amnesty International.
*22:00.200- 22:06.320* :  It says that recently manufactured arms from countries including China Russia Serbia Turkey
*22:06.320- 22:12.720* :  the UAE and Yemen are making their way into Sudan in large numbers often in breach of the
*22:12.720- 22:18.940* :  existing Darfur arms embargo. Sudan's civil war has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis
*22:18.940- 22:24.880* :  with more than 10 million people driven from their homes and another 50 million facing a hunger crisis.
*22:25.380- 22:30.060* :  The BBC's James Coppnell has been speaking to depro's machiner Amnesty International's
*22:30.060- 22:37.960* :  senior director for regional human rights impact. The weapons are finding themselves in the hands of
*22:37.960- 22:44.520* :  the parties to the conflict that parties to the conflict are now armed with this newly
*22:44.520- 22:51.320* :  arrived newly manufactured weapons and it's important that the world the international community
*22:51.320- 22:57.900* :  understand this Amnesty International analysed more than 1900 shipments records from two different
*22:57.900- 23:04.020* :  data providers. We also reviewed open source digital evidence including approximately
*23:05.420- 23:10.720* :  2004 to end videos showing that this recently manufactured or recently imported weapons in Sudan
*23:11.300- 23:16.880* :  have now found themselves into the hands of warring parties and the carnage continues.
*23:17.480- 23:23.380* :  This is the point we are making that this is a global trade in death. Amnesty has documented
*23:23.380- 23:29.680* :  the presence of recently manufactured weapons in Darfur which is a violation of the UN Security
*23:29.680- 23:36.720* :  Council arms embargoes have indicated and the embargoes prohibits all transfer of weapons.
*23:37.060- 23:44.380* :  What do you think needs to be done to build more of a global consensus to stop weapons and ammunition
*23:45.120- 23:51.260* :  flooding into Sudan to stop this war devastating the country? A number of things Amnesty International
*23:51.260- 23:57.800* :  is calling for Sudan's international and regional partners to ensure that any of this talk on
*23:57.800- 24:04.700* :  transition on peace processes, first of all guarantees justice, truth, reparation measures
*24:05.580- 24:11.020* :  for recent and past abuses including all the violations committed during the ongoing conflict.
*24:11.600- 24:17.720* :  As you know, James, the impact of this war has been devastating. Amnesty International and other
*24:17.720- 24:23.500* :  groups have documented civilian casualties both in-discriminate strikes, direct attacks on civilians
*24:24.060- 24:30.000* :  and some of our international humanitarian law partners have estimated that almost 11 million
*24:30.000- 24:35.720* :  people have been internally displaced and millions more at risk. So it's very, very important
*24:36.140- 24:42.480* :  that regional and international partners get much more involved in ensuring that we move the
*24:42.480- 24:48.300* :  process of ongoing peace process and so on. DePros, Meshena from Amnesty International.
*24:49.140- 24:53.560* :  Staying in Africa and the death toll from devastating landslides in southern Ethiopia has
*24:53.560- 24:59.660* :  risen to 257 search efforts for people who are missing have been hampered by heavy rains.
*25:00.100- 25:04.780* :  Kalganan Yibaltal, who's reached the affected area, says it's difficult to bring in aid.
*25:05.420- 25:10.780* :  It's inaccessible. It's remote and it's highly underdeveloped and it seems because of that
*25:12.220- 25:18.140* :  the emergency response efforts have been hampered. We have not seen any big machinery arriving here
*25:18.140- 25:26.000* :  trying to help people and even the humanitarian support that several real citizens are trying to
*25:26.440- 25:32.920* :  provide to the community are a little bit further away from the actual place where the landslides
*25:33.140- 25:39.120* :  happened. Kalganan Yibaltal in Ethiopia. Now our investors starting to doubt the euphoria
*25:39.120- 25:44.900* :  surrounding artificial intelligence. Well on Wednesday, shares tumbled on Wall Street.
*25:44.900- 25:50.000* :  The tech heavy Nasdaq declined by more than three and a half percent. It's worst day since December
*25:50.860- 25:56.020* :  2022 after disappointing earnings from heavyweights Alphabet and Tesla. For more on the stock
*25:56.020- 25:59.920* :  sell-off, here's our North America business correspondent Michelle Flurry in New York.
*26:00.460- 26:04.800* :  The big tech sell-off dragging down major US markets. What's behind it? Well,
*26:05.160- 26:10.040* :  there are a couple of things. First, traders are starting to question if they've become too
*26:10.040- 26:15.560* :  reliant on the magnificent seven. No, not the film from the 1960s, but a group of seven
*26:15.560- 26:21.980* :  high-performing stocks that includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.
*26:22.580- 26:28.400* :  All of them finished lower on Wednesday. And here's another number for you. 13 billion dollars.
*26:28.400- 26:34.380* :  That's how much Google spent on its AI efforts in the last three months. The number spooked
*26:34.380- 26:40.660* :  investors beginning to focus on the huge sums that are being spent on AI and are starting to question
*26:40.660- 26:46.060* :  if and when these bets will pay off. You know, Musk's announcement that he was officially
*26:46.060- 26:51.700* :  pushing back the unveiling of robot axes from August to October. Well, that didn't help either.
*26:52.320- 26:58.280* :  Price is also an issue. As one marketwater told me, tech shares have become too expensive. So
*26:58.900- 27:04.660* :  investors are moving their money into traditional industries in anticipation of rate cuts from
*27:04.660- 27:09.400* :  the Federal Reserve. Remember, a recent report showed progress on inflation and that's
*27:09.400- 27:15.120* :  increased the odds that America's Central Bank will cut rates in September. However, not everyone
*27:15.120- 27:20.800* :  was full of doom and gloom. One analyst I spoke to called Wednesdays sell off a knee-jerk reaction.
*27:20.800- 27:26.260* :  We'll find out if that's the case next week when more big tech companies, including Meta,
*27:26.260- 27:32.440* :  Amazon and Apple, report earnings. Michelle Flurry in New York and the sell-off continued in
*27:32.440- 27:39.400* :  Europe and Asia today while Wall Street has just opened flat. The Paris Olympics start tomorrow
*27:39.400- 27:44.620* :  and athletes are settling into their new surroundings in the Olympic village. Tom Daly is a
*27:44.620- 27:49.460* :  British competitor hoping to win another gold in the diving. He's been testing the strength of the
*27:49.460- 27:57.120* :  beds. This is cardboard. Then you've got the mattress and then these cardboard boxes
*27:58.400- 28:03.960* :  with the mattress on top and a mattress topper and then we get our own little Paris 24.
*28:07.380- 28:12.700* :  Devon Haru is CBC Canada's Olympic reporter in Paris. He's been given a full
*28:12.700- 28:18.340* :  tour of the Olympic village and is impressed. Leave it to the French to spare no details,
*28:18.340- 28:22.900* :  specifically when it comes to the food. I'm standing out front of the gym this morning because
*28:22.900- 28:28.780* :  I've eaten so many baguettes and cheese already in my stay here and everywhere you go in the athletes'
*28:28.780- 28:36.000* :  village, there is a bulangerie, a restaurant, croissants, baguettes. They've really made sure
*28:36.000- 28:40.780* :  that the athletes have all the food they want. When you walk in through the first gates,
*28:40.780- 28:46.980* :  right immediately there's this kind of bougie, classy lounge for the athletes, canopies.
*28:47.580- 28:51.880* :  They look very relaxed and you know I also want to point out I think this is important.
*28:51.880- 28:57.400* :  For the first time in Olympic history there's actually a nursery in the athletes village and that's
*28:57.400- 29:02.160* :  of course for breastfeeding moms, for families to be together and credit to Alice and Felix, the
*29:02.560- 29:07.560* :  great American athlete for pushing that. It's hard to believe it's taken that long for that to happen.
*29:08.140- 29:12.100* :  They have barber shops, salons, they were getting their nails and hair done. You've got to look good
*29:12.100- 29:17.960* :  for competition, laundromats everywhere. It's incredible to think that the first Olympic
*29:17.960- 29:23.800* :  athletes village was right here in Paris in 1924 and they had to pay to stay there because they
*29:23.800- 29:29.020* :  hadn't conceptualized what this thing was going to look like it evolved and sort of took full
*29:29.580- 29:37.540* :  setting in LA but here in Paris they had the choice of red or white wine or beer at lunch or
*29:38.260- 29:43.840* :  dinner. That really tells you how far they've come. There's some great stories about the marathoners
*29:43.840- 29:49.320* :  in 1924 being fueled by red wine to get to the finish line so they were having a party a hundred
*29:49.320- 29:57.000* :  years ago, not quite the case in the village in 2024. Reporter Devin Harou covering the Olympics in
*29:57.000- 30:04.020* :  Paris. And that is all from us for now but the global news podcast will be back very soon.

*30:09.260- 30:11.500* :  I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time goodbye.
*30:20.760- 30:27.880* :  He would appear in the dark. He hunted at night, terrorizing his victims. He was a killer.
*30:28.280- 30:34.240* :  He killed so many. He lost count. The whole scale of it is just it's mesmerizing.
*30:34.940- 30:42.780* :  But he's no longer behind bars. He's free. Now he's ready to talk. I'm not that monster that the people
*30:42.780- 30:49.460* :  say I am. World of Secrets from the BBC World Service. Season three, the apartheid killer.
