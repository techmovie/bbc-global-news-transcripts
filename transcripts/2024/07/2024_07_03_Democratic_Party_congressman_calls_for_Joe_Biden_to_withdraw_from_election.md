*01:33.320- 01:38.100* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in the early hours of Wednesday the third of July these are our main stories.
*01:38.780- 01:44.180* :  A democratic party congressman has become the first to call publicly for Joe Biden to withdraw
*01:44.180- 01:49.200* :  from November's election. A large number of candidates have withdrawn from the second round
*01:49.200- 01:54.140* :  of the French parliamentary election as the centre and left wing blocks try to prevent a far
*01:54.140- 01:59.860* :  right victory and Indian police are investigating the cause of a crush at a religious festival
*01:59.860- 02:06.980* :  in which more than a hundred people were killed. Also in this podcast in March,
*02:07.020- 02:13.640* :  Cheyung Man and Shanghai disguised himself by wearing a life-like mask that made him look decades
*02:13.640- 02:20.740* :  older. Calls in China for greater restrictions on the sale of hyper-realistic silicon face masks
*02:21.220- 02:24.080* :  following a string of crimes committed by people wearing them.
*02:28.480- 02:34.560* :  And we begin in the United States. The first democratic party congressman has urged President Biden
*02:34.560- 02:40.060* :  to make way for another candidate in November's presidential election. Lloyd Doggert said that
*02:40.060- 02:46.100* :  because Mr. Biden had always put the country first, he was hopeful he would take the painful decision
*02:46.100- 02:51.440* :  to withdraw following his performance in last week's debate with Donald Trump. The former
*02:51.440- 02:56.780* :  Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said it was fair to question the mental
*02:56.780- 03:02.000* :  acuity of candidates, but she praised Mr. Biden. Though he has a vision, he has knowledge,
*03:02.000- 03:08.840* :  he has judgment, he has a strategic thinking in the rest, he has a bad night. Now again,
*03:08.840- 03:15.160* :  I think it's a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a condition?
*03:15.500- 03:19.640* :  And so when people ask that question, it's completely legitimate of both candidates.
*03:20.280- 03:23.740* :  We heard more from our correspondent in Washington, Helena Humphrey,
*03:24.140- 03:27.200* :  first on the significance of Nancy Pelosi's remarks.
*03:27.940- 03:33.760* :  She is a long-time ally of President Biden and she does hold a great deal of influence
*03:33.820- 03:39.840* :  on the democratic party, so it is significant any time she speaks. So she was praising President
*03:39.840- 03:44.860* :  Biden in terms of his strategic thinking, she said. But she did echo those words that we heard
*03:44.860- 03:50.640* :  from the former President Barack Obama saying what we saw on the debate stage was a bad night.
*03:50.640- 03:56.980* :  But she also said it was legitimate for people voters to ask questions about both candidates,
*03:56.980- 04:02.860* :  she stressed, including whether President Biden's poor debate was an episode or a condition,
*04:02.860- 04:08.180* :  a one-off or indicative of something else. And she said that perhaps he should take
*04:08.180- 04:13.220* :  a mental fitness test. And she also recommended that he engage in more interviews with the press.
*04:13.920- 04:18.920* :  We do now know that President Biden will be sitting down with ABC's George Stephanopoulos
*04:18.920- 04:23.460* :  for a sit-down interview. Now that'll be going out on the 5th of July. And I think it's fair to
*04:23.460- 04:27.680* :  say that in light of what we saw on the debate stage, this will be very closely watched
*04:28.160- 04:33.220* :  by both those concerned democratic voters, and of course the Trump campaign as well.
*04:33.740- 04:39.100* :  And Congressman Lloyd Duggett has gone further saying that Mr Biden should pull out of the race.
*04:39.100- 04:46.500* :  How likely is that? I think it is pretty unlikely. At this stage based on what President Biden himself
*04:46.500- 04:51.900* :  has said, he's vowed to stay in the race. The White House has been defending him today with
*04:51.900- 04:56.880* :  heard from spokesperson Karin Jean-Pierre. And she was saying let's turn the page, let's look at what
*04:56.880- 05:02.120* :  the president has achieved. She says that he is committed. But at the same time she said a
*05:02.120- 05:07.220* :  cognitive test wasn't necessary. She said it was a fair question, but it wasn't necessary.
*05:07.220- 05:11.840* :  And she said ultimately, President Biden is going to be out. He's going to be out on the campaign
*05:11.840- 05:17.080* :  trail. The public then will have the chance to judge for themselves. The issue is though, I think,
*05:17.080- 05:21.880* :  that some voters are saying that they've already had that chance to judge for themselves. That was
*05:21.880- 05:27.000* :  the debate stage. And essentially they were concerned by what they saw. But President Biden,
*05:27.000- 05:31.120* :  his wife Jill Biden, and the White House saying that he will remain in the race.
*05:31.480- 05:37.120* :  And just finally, in other developments, Donald Trump's sentencing for falsifying business records
*05:37.120- 05:41.340* :  has been delayed. What can you tell us? Yeah, that's right. That's with regards to his New York
*05:41.340- 05:47.040* :  hush money trial. The sentencing was meant to be on the 11th of July. It won't take place now
*05:47.040- 05:53.100* :  until the 18th of September. Now, this is all in relation to the Supreme Court's ruling on
*05:53.100- 05:58.380* :  presidential immunity. So lawyers for the former president asked to have the chance to argue that
*05:58.380- 06:03.180* :  he shouldn't have been prosecuted, given that some of the evidence they say is from his time in
*06:03.180- 06:08.120* :  office. So instead, it will be delayed. Politically, this could be a boost for him at a time when
*06:08.120- 06:12.840* :  President Biden is having a harder time in the presidential campaign. That was Helena Humphrey.
*06:13.520- 06:19.840* :  Now, as we record this podcast, the devastating category five storm hurricane barrel continues
*06:19.840- 06:26.620* :  to move northwest towards Jamaica. Aerial pictures from the island of Karyaku show severely
*06:26.620- 06:32.780* :  damaged houses, mangled cars, and downed power lines. It was a similar picture in union
*06:32.780- 06:37.460* :  island part of St Vincent and the Grenadines. A number of deaths have been reported.
*06:37.580- 06:43.740* :  With winds of more than 200 kilometers an hour, Burrell is expected to hit Jamaica on Wednesday.
*06:43.820- 06:49.640* :  Katrina Perry heard more from the CBS news correspondent Tom Hanson, who's in Jamaica.
*06:50.560- 06:56.420* :  This has really been a critical day where so many people have started to truly prepare
*06:56.420- 07:01.640* :  for this storm. It's starting to sink in. We're at the Montego Bay airport here where we have
*07:01.640- 07:06.760* :  seen a steady stream of people, both Americans and from other countries around the world,
*07:06.760- 07:13.700* :  really trying their best to get out before this potentially catastrophic storm comes through the
*07:13.700- 07:18.340* :  area. There are airlines here that have added extra flights, including American, including
*07:18.340- 07:23.340* :  that blue. Other airlines have offered waivers to compensate people for flights that have been
*07:23.340- 07:27.980* :  canceled. But really, it's been a mad dash here at the airport for people to try to get out.
*07:27.980- 07:32.220* :  We spoke to one couple who said they cut their trip short. They were supposed to leave on Friday.
*07:32.220- 07:38.520* :  They're now leaving tonight and they said they wanted to play it safe and not be sorry for having
*07:38.520- 07:42.860* :  to stick around and put themselves in a potentially risky situation. And let's talk about the risky
*07:42.860- 07:49.040* :  situation here because the forecast is ominous and it is pins and needles here in Jamaica.
*07:49.040- 07:55.700* :  So we're talking about some significant storm surge and some very dangerous winds around 150
*07:55.700- 08:03.380* :  miles per hour right now as barrel barrels through Jamaica. So certainly a tense situation here.
*08:03.380- 08:09.820* :  There's a lot of anxiety as we lead into the night hours and into the morning Katrina.
*08:10.540- 08:16.900* :  And Tom, we know Jamaica is an island of haves and have nots. What are preparations like there?
*08:16.900- 08:22.620* :  How well are people are the authorities ready for this? Yeah, well, you know, we actually visited a
*08:22.620- 08:28.480* :  grocery store today where there was a line snaking all the way through the grocery store from
*08:28.480- 08:34.440* :  aisle to aisle people trying to grab whatever they can in order to prepare. Mainly one of the
*08:34.440- 08:40.260* :  critical resources is bottled water because as we know, when these hurricanes strike, the first
*08:40.260- 08:45.800* :  thing to go so many times is clean water. It shuts down the water system. So that is definitely
*08:45.800- 08:52.140* :  something that people are taking very seriously. As far as haves and have nots, yeah, there's a
*08:52.140- 08:56.880* :  huge income gap. There's a huge quality of life gap in this country. And so, of course,
*08:56.960- 09:03.160* :  the people who can't afford to stay in a structure that will withstand this dangerous storm,
*09:03.160- 09:08.200* :  they're going to be hit the hardest. And certainly aid groups are already anticipating
*09:08.980- 09:11.840* :  jumping into action to help those people most in need Katrina.
*09:12.460- 09:17.000* :  That was CBS News Correspondent Tom Hanson in Jamaica talking to Katrina Perry.
*09:18.140- 09:22.880* :  More than 210 candidates have withdrawn from the second round of the French parliamentary
*09:22.880- 09:28.960* :  elections in an effort to prevent a far-right victory. It was anticipated that politicians from
*09:28.960- 09:34.260* :  the centre and left would step aside to ensure that the vote against the far-right national rally
*09:34.260- 09:38.180* :  will not be split. Hugh Scofield has been following events in Paris.
*09:38.880- 09:44.460* :  Efforts to thwart the national rallies momentum have borne fruit with a large number of seats in
*09:44.460- 09:49.120* :  which other candidates have stood aside in order to focus the anti-far-right vote.
*09:49.120- 09:55.940* :  With declarations now closed, it's confirmed that in 218 constituencies, a third contender from
*09:55.940- 10:02.780* :  the centre or left has pulled out. Now there remain only 91 three-way races in the election out
*10:02.780- 10:08.700* :  of originally just over 300. What it means is that the chances of the RN reaching the key number
*10:08.700- 10:15.420* :  of 289 seats in Sunday's second round, the figure needed for an absolute majority, are slimmer
*10:15.420- 10:18.960* :  than they were. The party's leader, Marine Le Pen, was still hopeful, though,
*10:18.960- 10:24.560* :  insisting that her party would only form a government if it was able to command a vote in the assembly.
*10:24.820- 10:29.800* :  It is evident that we don't have a vote. Of course, we want to agree to go into the government
*10:29.800- 10:35.840* :  if we can't act. Of voters want us to change the way things are done. If we can't do that,
*10:35.840- 10:42.100* :  if we take office simply to sit in our ministerial chairs, that would be the worst possible betrayal
*10:42.100- 10:47.220* :  of our voters. The anti-RN camp is relieved that the mobilisation has had an effect
*10:47.220- 10:53.020* :  and that the chances of an absolute majority for the far-right look weaker. For the RN itself,
*10:53.020- 10:57.700* :  it's all more evidence of the system coming together to block them from power,
*10:58.080- 11:02.780* :  even after they've been clearly designated by voters as the biggest party in the land.
*11:03.280- 11:07.880* :  That was Huesco Field. So how will the standing down of hundreds of candidates
*11:07.880- 11:14.140* :  affect the second round of the French Parliamentary Election this coming Sunday? Paul Henley spoke
*11:14.140- 11:19.840* :  to Flores Fouche, the director of the Centre for European Studies and Comparative Politics
*11:19.840- 11:26.860* :  at Ciospo in Paris. Is it possible to project whether this initiative will deprive Marine
*11:26.860- 11:32.620* :  Le Pen's party of a parliamentary majority? It is not really because it's still too early.
*11:32.620- 11:38.100* :  We've only learnt about the constituencies where there will be only two candidates and those
*11:38.100- 11:44.880* :  where there will be three and calculations need to take place. And so we'll know in probably
*11:44.880- 11:51.960* :  24 hours or a little more much more precisely what is likely to be the situation. So right now,
*11:51.960- 11:58.140* :  the predictions that we have are far too imprecise. Why have there been more left-wing candidates
*11:58.140- 12:04.220* :  standing down than those from President Macron's party? For, I think, two reason. The first one is
*12:04.220- 12:12.460* :  that the left has had taken the habits of doing the fore-republic kind. It's not certain not
*12:12.500- 12:18.820* :  the first time since 2002. It's happened quite a few times. The second one is that in a way,
*12:18.860- 12:26.080* :  the centrist or the Macron coalition actually playing it for their advantage. That's one of the
*12:26.080- 12:32.200* :  reasons why there was a dissolution of Parliament. And they have campaigned for three weeks,
*12:32.200- 12:38.020* :  arguing that La France Insoumise was as extreme and as dangerous of the National Front. And
*12:38.020- 12:44.940* :  therefore, they are following that and not standing down when the candidate of the left
*12:44.940- 12:50.940* :  is someone from La France Insoumise. You say it's too early to be sure whether this tactic can
*12:50.940- 12:56.940* :  work for President Macron is newly found allies, but you must know if there's a practical
*12:56.940- 13:04.360* :  possibility of it working and keeping the far right out. What may work is that Macron at this
*13:04.360- 13:10.860* :  stage and his supporters may limit something which will no doubt be remembered as one of the
*13:11.060- 13:18.920* :  most disastrous dissolution of Parliament. The question is whether the Assemblyman National
*13:18.920- 13:27.060* :  can obtain an absolute majority. And at this stage, it's quite unlikely. They will probably need
*13:27.060- 13:33.940* :  some extra support, so they will be looking for allies. And the second question is whether they
*13:33.940- 13:41.700* :  will be able to find enough support from the party of the mainstream rights which kind of split
*13:41.700- 13:48.960* :  off to call for support for the Assemblyman National. So it's very likely that we will have
*13:48.960- 13:51.740* :  kind of hung parliament with no clear majority.
*13:52.420- 13:58.100* :  Flores Fouche, the Director of the Centre for European Studies and Comparative Politics at
*13:58.100- 14:09.880* :  Cionspo in Paris. To India now. More than a hundred people have died in a crush at a religious
*14:09.880- 14:15.260* :  event in the northern state of Utapradesh. A large number of women and some children have been
*14:15.260- 14:20.500* :  killed and many are still being identified. One man spoke of his personal losses.
*14:24.240- 14:28.480* :  I came to this event with eight other people, but none of them survived.
*14:33.880- 14:39.600* :  I am in the city of Alegre which is about 200 kilometers southeast of Delhi in the state of
*14:39.600- 14:44.740* :  Utapradesh. I am now in the corridor of one of the main hospitals where many of the injured
*14:44.740- 14:51.060* :  people had been admitted and the number of those who had died, their bodies, they have been brought
*14:51.060- 14:57.640* :  here for post-Martin and the relatives are all sitting along this corridor and I spoke to a man
*14:57.640- 15:05.040* :  who lost his wife. She was 33 and she went with two children to this sermon by a very popular
*15:05.040- 15:10.700* :  Hindu religious preacher and the two children were sitting on the men's side with one of the
*15:10.700- 15:17.060* :  uncles. So what he said was the crush happened mostly on the side of where the women were sitting.
*15:17.060- 15:22.040* :  There were thousands of people who came to listen and there are conflicting information about
*15:22.040- 15:28.660* :  how this crush started and this man whom I spoke to, he was telling us that many people tried
*15:28.660- 15:33.080* :  to get the blessings of this preacher and that was the time when this crush happened.
*15:33.080- 15:39.680* :  The casualty figure is likely to go up. One of the police officials who we spoke to a few minutes
*15:39.680- 15:43.900* :  ago he said the figure could be much higher than what has been officially confirmed.
*15:44.740- 15:49.080* :  Give us an idea of the scale, what sorts of numbers of people were actually there,
*15:49.080- 15:56.120* :  what sorts of numbers were expected? I saw some videos taken soon after the crush started.
*15:56.380- 16:00.760* :  There were thousands and thousands of people and one of the local journalists was saying that
*16:00.760- 16:07.060* :  permission was taken only for about 20 to 25,000 people but then there were more people,
*16:07.060- 16:12.960* :  thousands more. The crowd control procedures were not clear but I saw some of these videos
*16:12.960- 16:19.540* :  are taken by some local people just after this incident happened where in the open ground there
*16:19.540- 16:24.940* :  were thousands and thousands of people. It's not the first such disaster at religious gatherings in
*16:24.940- 16:29.920* :  India though is it? We have been having this kind of what he called stampede or crush for a number
*16:29.920- 16:35.660* :  of years. There was one incident in 2022 in a famous Hindu temple in northern India and then
*16:35.660- 16:41.720* :  another religious festival in central India in 2016 so the government has been trying to put
*16:41.720- 16:46.920* :  some crowd control mechanism but then each state is different. The state authorities have their
*16:46.920- 16:53.160* :  own police force in trying to do the crowd control. So how far this has worked? That is a big
*16:53.160- 16:58.880* :  question but there will be many questions for the authorities why they were not able to prevent it.
*16:59.520- 17:06.060* :  Umbhurasan at Eirajan in India. There have been calls in China for greater restrictions on the
*17:06.060- 17:12.440* :  sale of hyper-realistic silicon face masks following a string of crimes committed by people
*17:12.440- 17:18.500* :  wearing them. Here's Celia Hatton. In March, a young man in Shanghai disguised himself by

*19:08.660- 19:15.100* :  Camino Ghosts. This time a 300 year old curse is stirring up more trouble and paradise than ever
*19:15.100- 19:19.980* :  before. Whether you're traveling with friends or family or staying close to home this summer
*19:20.260- 19:25.200* :  everyone can get on the same page with this intriguing novel that delivers sun, sand and mystery.
*19:26.080- 19:30.940* :  Camino Ghosts is in stores now also available as an audiobook read by Woopy Goldberg.
*19:36.280- 19:42.000* :  This week's UN led meetings in Qatar were the first to include the Taliban since they seized
*19:42.000- 19:47.620* :  power in Afghanistan almost three years ago. And at the end of the talks although there were no
*19:47.620- 19:53.820* :  breakthroughs or announcements diplomats have described them as productive. But there were no women
*19:53.820- 20:01.000* :  or other civil society groups present the Taliban had insisted that they be excluded. Afghan women
*20:01.000- 20:07.180* :  and girls live in the country under comprehensive restrictions. They are not able to attend secondary
*20:07.180- 20:13.500* :  school, visit parks or gyms and hold certain jobs. And agreeing to shut them out of these talks
*20:13.500- 20:18.900* :  caused a lot of controversy as our correspondent Caroline Davis Indohar explained.
*20:19.780- 20:24.340* :  So we heard from groups like human rights watch and amnesty international but also from
*20:24.700- 20:29.060* :  women's rights activists in particular as well being critical of the fact that these meetings
*20:29.060- 20:34.540* :  were going ahead under the conditions that the Taliban authorities wanted. They didn't want to
*20:34.540- 20:39.660* :  be in the room with other people from civil society. They wanted to be the only people representing
*20:39.660- 20:45.580* :  Afghanistan on this occasion. That was something that the UN did agree to because there were no civil
*20:45.580- 20:48.780* :  society activists in the room. That meant of course that there were no women from Afghanistan.
*20:49.400- 20:53.220* :  And that's what led to criticism people talking about the fact that this could set a dangerous
*20:53.220- 20:58.940* :  president. Now meanwhile you have been speaking to a Taliban spokesman, haven't you? What did he have
*20:59.340- 21:03.960* :  to say? Yes, tabula Mohen Mujahid is the Taliban spokesperson who is also
*21:03.960- 21:08.360* :  leading the delegation and my spoke to him yesterday after these talks have finished.
*21:08.760- 21:13.620* :  One thing he was completely adamant on was about women's rights. Now of course this has been
*21:14.020- 21:18.660* :  brought up even though it wasn't officially on the agenda. We've been told that in these closed
*21:18.660- 21:24.100* :  door meetings that lots of the countries continue to bring up women's rights and women's roles
*21:24.100- 21:30.000* :  in Afghanistan. He was very clear that this is an internal issue in his words. This is something
*21:30.000- 21:35.220* :  that they will not talk to the international community about. They don't want them to come in
*21:35.240- 21:39.420* :  and in their view into fear in that they say this is something that they are dealing with on their
*21:39.420- 21:44.180* :  own. I then pointed out that the Taliban authorities have essentially been in control of
*21:44.180- 21:50.680* :  Afghanistan since August 2021, nearly three years. So if it is an internal issue,
*21:51.200- 21:53.500* :  why has that not been solved? And this was the answer he gave me.
*21:57.540- 22:03.140* :  There are a lot of issues that still have to be resolved and we're working on it. This issue is
*22:03.140- 22:08.560* :  one of them. I'm again emphasizing that we will find a solution for it inside Afghanistan.
*22:09.340- 22:14.380* :  The Islamic Emirates says that this issue is waiting to be dealt with. We're not ignoring it.
*22:14.640- 22:20.800* :  We're finding a solution for it based on share a law. So, Carrie, what did these talks actually
*22:20.800- 22:27.060* :  achieve? Well, even from the outset, we were told we're not expecting some massive breakthrough
*22:27.060- 22:31.880* :  or big solutions or big announcements and we didn't get those things. Everybody we spoke to,
*22:31.880- 22:36.800* :  the words that kept on coming up were this is a process that was from the Taliban authority side.
*22:36.800- 22:40.540* :  That's what we heard from all the diplomats. This is about doing things step-by-step, understanding
*22:40.540- 22:45.540* :  everybody's on the same page and then gradually moving forward. And at the moment, we don't know
*22:45.540- 22:50.500* :  exactly what step forward will happen next. The main topics of discussion at these particular
*22:50.500- 22:56.940* :  meetings were firstly on counter narcotics and on the economy here. Both topics that the Taliban
*22:56.940- 23:01.460* :  authorities wanted to talk about. So not quite so thorny as an issue as women's rights.
*23:02.360- 23:09.640* :  The UN have also been very clear that these talks are not about official recognition of the Taliban
*23:09.640- 23:15.620* :  authorities as being the government in Afghanistan. At the moment, no country around the world
*23:15.620- 23:21.700* :  has officially recognized the Taliban authorities as being Afghanistan's government. However,
*23:21.700- 23:25.860* :  there are diplomats who say, well, this is kind of real politic. If you want to do something that
*23:25.860- 23:30.580* :  actually helps Afghanistan, you have to get a conversation going to the people who are currently
*23:30.860- 23:35.760* :  ruling the country that Taliban aren't going anywhere at the moment. And so in order to be able
*23:35.760- 23:40.460* :  to do something that might benefit the Afghan people, those conversations should happen.
*23:40.920- 23:45.200* :  Diplomats here seem to think it's gone fairly well. Let's see where it goes to next.
*23:45.840- 23:47.160* :  Caroline Davis in Doha.
*23:48.120- 23:54.860* :  To Kenya next, on Tuesday, activists in the capital Nairobi placed empty coffins in front of
*23:54.860- 24:01.160* :  riot police to draw attention to excessive use of force as protests continue across the country.
*24:01.180- 24:07.160* :  Rights groups say 39 people have been killed over the past two weeks. Those protesting
*24:07.580- 24:10.560* :  want to see change from the country's president William Ruta.
*24:11.260- 24:16.480* :  I'm protesting for my kids, Jan Alfa. I grew up fearing presidents. The people that my vote
*24:16.480- 24:21.540* :  hires and that my voice can fire. And now Ruta should know that we are firing him.
*24:21.540- 24:26.160* :  And if he's willing to spill our blood, we're willing to stand up to him. He's a big bully.
*24:26.160- 24:30.820* :  Currently, I'm unemployed. But with the taxes that which are happening that are being
*24:30.820- 24:35.940* :  imposed on me, I have no work. So I can't pay for them and yet I'm being asked to pay.
*24:36.740- 24:43.380* :  So why why not just at those use his own salaries, reduce the MP salaries to help the Kenyan people?
*24:44.120- 24:49.700* :  To prevent people gathering for further anti-government demonstrations, police fired tear gas and
*24:49.700- 24:53.280* :  used water cannon. Barbara Plesarsza is in Nairobi.
*24:53.900- 24:58.540* :  There are running street battles between protesters and police here in the center of Nairobi.
*24:58.540- 25:02.900* :  Also, the main road to the city has been blocked. And there are protests in other parts of the
*25:02.900- 25:09.680* :  country as well in the Port City of Mombasa and in the western parts of Kenya. The youth movement
*25:09.680- 25:15.120* :  that triggered all of this is united in its anger against the president. They say he hasn't shown
*25:15.120- 25:20.400* :  remorse for the people who were killed and he hasn't taken accountability and responsibility.
*25:20.440- 25:27.920* :  So that has made them very angry. Many of them also believe that this is not over yet. They have
*25:27.920- 25:32.880* :  won their battle against the tax bill, which the president was forced to withdraw. But they haven't
*25:32.880- 25:37.180* :  won the war against what they see as corruption and excessive spending by political elites.
*25:37.740- 25:42.780* :  But they are not united in a strategy for moving forward. For example, there was a call to come
*25:42.780- 25:48.260* :  back to the streets today. Some came back. Some did not. This is a movement without a formal
*25:48.260- 25:52.420* :  leadership. They are proud of that. They see it as their strength. But it also means it's more
*25:52.420- 25:58.520* :  difficult for them to organize a strategy for going forward with how to achieve what they want
*25:58.520- 26:05.440* :  to achieve. Barbara Plesarsza in Kenya. Tonight, Julia next. The high cost of living there is
*26:05.440- 26:11.760* :  making medicines unaffordable for many. Some asthma inhalers have doubled or even tripled in
*26:11.760- 26:17.260* :  price since last year. As a result, many people are struggling to afford them, especially
*26:17.260- 26:23.600* :  invulnerable communities. Low enrollment in health insurance is forcing many to pay out of their
*26:23.600- 26:32.700* :  own pockets. Mako Occio-Kafo reports from Legos. Phoebe, a single mother and school teacher in
*26:32.700- 26:42.740* :  Legos, has been living with asthma since she was 15. Among other daily essentials,
*26:43.320- 26:48.660* :  Nigeria's high inflation and currency depreciation are falling in huge rise in the cost of drugs.
*26:49.320- 26:54.700* :  Every day, Phoebe is worried. She recalls a recent asthma attack when she was struggling to
*26:55.100- 27:01.440* :  breathe without her inhaler. When I was sleeping from bed, I started breathing so very high,
*27:01.740- 27:07.980* :  like the breathing was so much. I was breathing for like two hours. I didn't want to call myself
*27:07.980- 27:13.900* :  still there fighting for my life. In Nigeria, some inhalers have doubled or tripled in price
*27:14.320- 27:19.900* :  since the last quarter of 2023. If the pay without $25,000, the first thing that comes to my mind
*27:19.900- 27:27.380* :  is money for inhaler because I can't survive without it. I can't do without my inhaler.
*27:27.540- 27:31.780* :  So I need to go first to the pharmacy, get my inhaler before we relax,
*27:31.780- 27:36.440* :  take a little of the expenses. And there is no way that one would be enough.
*27:36.900- 27:42.320* :  Phoebe now takes on extra jobs like catering just to make ends meet. She's struggling to afford
*27:42.320- 27:47.200* :  her usual inhaler and is suffering more frequent asthma attacks. When I was growing up,
*27:47.200- 27:51.480* :  so I was mentally and I was using all of a sudden, mentally, it was around $90,000 on the air.
*27:51.760- 27:56.480* :  Even if I know cooking, that much is very, very stressful for me and I'm kind of
*27:56.520- 28:02.360* :  triggered. I have to still take the risk because when you need this money.
*28:04.440- 28:09.180* :  Nigeria relies heavily on imported medicines and the government has promised to reduce
*28:09.180- 28:13.340* :  drug costs through local production, but it's unclear when this will happen.
*28:13.820- 28:19.400* :  Health activists like Kinsley Thompson are starting to campaign for the government to
*28:19.440- 28:21.240* :  step in and make inhalers free.
*28:26.780- 28:31.440* :  The cost of living in prison in Nigeria is very tough. In fact, not just the poor,
*28:31.440- 28:34.700* :  the amount of medication can no longer breathe. The poor can't no longer breathe anymore.
*28:34.880- 28:40.380* :  That is why I am campaigning for making inhaler free. You know because people shouldn't be paying
*28:40.380- 28:46.380* :  to breathe. Breathing is free. Although the country's public health insurance does offer affordable
*28:46.380- 28:53.000* :  asthma care. Dr Akinkumi, a lawyer from Boston Health Limited, a health insurance firm in Lagos,
*28:53.400- 28:57.140* :  says lack of confidence in the scheme means enrollment is low.
*28:57.640- 29:03.320* :  People who have health insurance currently in Nigeria is 10% or less. Very important is trust,
*29:03.320- 29:07.620* :  the issue of trust. You know, the government, especially in this part of the world, have
*29:07.620- 29:12.300* :  filled people over and over again, so it becomes very difficult for them to actually trust what
*29:12.300- 29:18.980* :  the government is bringing forward. Nigeria's health minister says the government wants to expand
*29:18.980- 29:24.260* :  insurance coverage, but it will need to win over people like Phoebe.
*29:25.260- 29:31.240* :  That report from Makawachi or Kaffir in Lagos. Scientists have discovered that
*29:31.240- 29:37.680* :  ants sometimes bite off each other's limbs in order to save them from fatal infections.
*29:38.480- 29:41.680* :  The process has a high survival rate. Here's Paul Moss.
*29:42.280- 29:46.540* :  The site came as quite a shock to the German researchers who first observed it.
*29:46.920- 29:52.060* :  Ants offering up their injured limb to another ant who proceeded to bite it off.
*29:52.400- 29:58.140* :  The insect surgeon then passed their patient on to a third ant who treated the wound with a fluid
*29:58.140- 30:03.760* :  which seems to have some kind of anti-infection effect. These leg biters were selective.
*30:03.760- 30:08.440* :  If the injury was low on the ants' leg, they would just treat the wound with a fluid.
*30:08.920- 30:14.380* :  One scientist described this as the most efficient medical system in the entire animal kingdom.
*30:15.140- 30:21.080* :  Paul Moss. Now, as we heard in the earlier podcast, the British tennis star and two times
*30:21.080- 30:26.580* :  Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray has pulled out of this year's men's singles tournament
*30:26.580- 30:32.220* :  because of continuing medical problems with his back. The 37-year-old has said that this
*30:32.220- 30:37.040* :  would be his last year entering the contest, although he still plans to make his farewell
*30:37.680- 30:41.060* :  by playing in the men's doubles, teaming up with his brother Jamie.
*30:42.080- 30:47.120* :  And with Wimbledon in full swing at the moment, there will be a great deal of focus on those who
*30:47.120- 30:53.280* :  win. But what about those who don't? Those who spend their lives slogging away in the lower
*30:53.280- 30:59.700* :  rankings hoping for a breakthrough. Connor Nyland was one of those. At one point he was Ireland's
*30:59.700- 31:05.080* :  number one player, but his highest international ranking was 129th in the world.
*31:05.900- 31:11.840* :  And that is a very lonely place to be as he writes in his book The Racket, on tour with tennis's
*31:11.840- 31:18.860* :  Golden Generation and the other 99%. Sarah Montague asked him just how lonely it is in the tennis
*31:18.860- 31:25.540* :  circuit if you have a low ranking. It's a tough it's a tough existence and yeah I was born in 1981
*31:25.540- 31:31.680* :  the same year as Roger Federer and Serena Williams, but didn't rack up 20 plus slams and didn't
*31:31.680- 31:36.880* :  have the entourage as that they had and the thing about tennis is when you're eight so the top 100
*31:36.880- 31:42.700* :  in the world the prize money kind of falls off the cliff and so I was traveling either on my own.
*31:43.260- 31:48.240* :  Occasionally I'd bring a coach with me and but it's a very much a budget existence.
*31:48.600- 31:54.060* :  Going to bar of lung places for very little prize money and obviously I go into that in death
*31:54.060- 32:00.280* :  in the book but also it's a funny book this humor in it and sort of some laughter in the dark as
*32:00.280- 32:05.680* :  opposed. Given the prize money that you reference in the book how do you how do you keep it going?
*32:05.880- 32:10.860* :  Well it's lucky enough I was on a tennis scholarship in the States and when I finished there I had
*32:11.180- 32:15.880* :  had a private sponsor but as I talked about in the book it felt a little less like sponsorship
*32:15.880- 32:22.280* :  and more like charity. I sort of said listen well I put your part of your business on my sleeve
*32:22.280- 32:25.720* :  or one of the things I know I don't worry about it's not going to be watching it anyway.
*32:26.420- 32:33.000* :  So he was sort of a tennis fan and was happy to help out and then of course the financial crisis came
*32:33.000- 32:38.520* :  into 2009 and it was a very hard to get sponsorship and I got to a ranking where I was just about
*32:38.520- 32:44.180* :  able to let it wash its own face as opposed to the ranking I was at it in sort of 150 in the
*32:44.180- 32:49.540* :  world but no more than that. But Connor your description of what it's like just given the nature
*32:49.540- 32:52.900* :  of tennis that you're on your own you're not necessarily with somebody else you're spending much
*32:52.900- 32:56.720* :  of your life in hotel rooms not particularly nice ones you're going to the court and your own
*32:56.720- 33:01.360* :  you're sort of begging somebody to practice with you. One can't help thinking why do you look
*33:01.360- 33:06.340* :  back and think I should have packed it in much sooner? Well I had this carrot of Wimbledon and
*33:06.640- 33:10.940* :  you know it's all going to be on the field now the next two weeks and we all get very excited
*33:10.940- 33:16.500* :  about it and I was like anybody watching and I was a dreamer and there was a chance for me to play
*33:16.500- 33:21.920* :  in Wimbledon and the US Open and luckily I got there and that sort of justified I suppose the struggle
*33:21.920- 33:29.020* :  and I got there at 29 so it was a long time coming and what I'm glad I still got it and I even had a
*33:29.020- 33:34.360* :  book in me at the end of it all that day that there's challenging it was. The tennis player and writer
*33:34.680- 33:41.620* :  Conor Nyland and that's it from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global news
