*00:00.000- 00:03.140* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:05.500- 00:08.320* :  I'm Janet Joliel, and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday,
*00:08.320- 00:10.680* :  the 4th of July, these are our main stories.
*00:11.260- 00:14.500* :  The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has launched a new barrage
*00:14.500- 00:17.340* :  of cross-border fight at Israel over Wednesday's killing
*00:17.340- 00:19.060* :  of a senior Hezbollah commander.
*00:19.880- 00:22.480* :  President Biden meets leading Democrats at the White House
*00:22.700- 00:24.320* :  as he fights for his political life
*00:24.700- 00:26.880* :  after his filtering debate performance last week.
*00:27.720- 00:29.960* :  Strong winds and heavy rain hit the Cayman Islands
*00:30.020- 00:33.220* :  as Hurricane Beryl makes its way towards the coast of Mexico.
*00:35.920- 00:36.760* :  Also in this podcast?
*00:37.280- 00:39.220* :  Has she inherited this from you and your wife?
*00:40.160- 00:42.360* :  Not really, we don't play chess at all.
*00:42.820- 00:43.820* :  Really, you don't play?
*00:43.820- 00:44.140* :  Completely.
*00:44.600- 00:46.500* :  This is completely up and accidentally.
*00:47.220- 00:50.960* :  The 9-year-old girl who is now England's youngest international
*00:51.020- 00:51.720* :  Chester.
*00:56.140- 00:58.420* :  We start this podcast in Northern Israel.
*01:04.360- 01:07.360* :  This was a sound on Thursday across one of the world's most
*01:07.360- 01:11.120* :  volatile borders as the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah
*01:11.120- 01:14.280* :  fired more than 200 rockets and explosive drones
*01:14.860- 01:17.820* :  in retaliation for Israel's killing of one of its senior
*01:17.820- 01:19.240* :  commanders a day earlier.
*01:19.840- 01:23.320* :  The land in Northern Israel and southern Lebanon is tinder-dry,
*01:23.760- 01:27.200* :  ready to be consumed by the sparks that fly on an almost daily
*01:27.200- 01:29.580* :  basis between these two sworn enemies.
*01:30.180- 01:32.560* :  A concern for all those who watched this region
*01:32.940- 01:36.220* :  and fear the cross-border exchanges could erupt into a full
*01:36.440- 01:37.160* :  blown war.
*01:37.680- 01:40.260* :  Not just between a heavily armed Hezbollah and Israel,
*01:40.260- 01:43.200* :  but also drawing in Hezbollah's backer Iran.
*01:44.200- 01:47.620* :  Iran also supports Hamas, which earlier said it had sent
*01:47.620- 01:51.860* :  ideas to Qatarian Egyptian mediators aimed at ending its war
*01:51.860- 01:52.380* :  with Israel.
*01:53.180- 01:56.120* :  For its part, Israel has confirmed that it's in its words
*01:56.120- 01:59.480* :  evaluating what it describes as Hamas's new comments on
*01:59.480- 02:01.080* :  a ceasefire and hostage deal.
*02:01.860- 02:03.960* :  I got more and all this with our Middle East correspondent,
*02:03.960- 02:07.400* :  Yolanda Nell, first on the latest barrage across the
*02:07.400- 02:08.560* :  Israel-Lebanon border.
*02:09.160- 02:12.160* :  This is the latest surge in violence in what is really
*02:12.160- 02:15.340* :  a steadily worsening conflict across the Israel-Lebanese
*02:15.380- 02:15.780* :  border.
*02:16.220- 02:19.700* :  This barrage of rockets, Hezbollah said more than 200 fired,
*02:19.700- 02:23.940* :  as well as 20 attack-drones sent, was retaliation for the
*02:23.940- 02:26.540* :  killing of this top Hezbollah commander Muhammad Nasser a
*02:26.540- 02:27.000* :  day ago.
*02:27.000- 02:29.220* :  He was killed in an airstrike entire.
*02:29.740- 02:33.120* :  And the Israeli military says only really that a number of
*02:33.120- 02:36.940* :  the incoming rockets were intercepted by air defense and its
*02:36.940- 02:38.740* :  fighter jets for the drones.
*02:38.760- 02:42.720* :  And we're not hearing any reports of injuries on the Israeli
*02:42.720- 02:45.640* :  side, although certainly there have been several fires that
*02:45.640- 02:47.740* :  have been started as a result of all this.
*02:48.340- 02:51.460* :  Now, the Lebanese national news agency has been saying that
*02:51.480- 02:53.840* :  there were Israeli jets that then broke the sound barrier
*02:53.840- 02:54.920* :  over parts of Lebanon.
*02:55.420- 02:58.200* :  They've been in response to all of this hitting what they
*02:58.200- 03:01.040* :  described the Israeli military, as Hezbollah military
*03:01.040- 03:02.780* :  structures in southern Lebanon.
*03:03.520- 03:06.100* :  And meanwhile, this fighting continues to rage in Gaza.
*03:06.620- 03:10.920* :  Hamas says it has sent new ideas to mediators on how to end
*03:10.920- 03:12.060* :  its war with Israel.
*03:12.740- 03:15.580* :  Is this likely to be any more successful than previous
*03:15.580- 03:16.240* :  such statements?
*03:17.020- 03:19.440* :  I mean, really, it's just not clear yet if this is going to
*03:19.440- 03:22.240* :  lead to some kind of a breakthrough, we've had so many failed
*03:22.240- 03:25.560* :  efforts to bring about a new ceasefire and hostage release
*03:25.560- 03:25.900* :  deal.
*03:26.480- 03:28.720* :  But what we're hearing, Hamas has said it's responded in a
*03:28.760- 03:30.960* :  positive spirit to the deal that's on the table.
*03:31.520- 03:34.500* :  Essentially, this three-phase plan that President Biden's
*03:34.500- 03:36.400* :  been pushing, saying that it came from the Israeli side.
*03:36.940- 03:39.280* :  The Israeli Prime Minister's office said very quickly it was
*03:39.280- 03:42.040* :  evaluating this, and we'll get back to the mediators.
*03:42.040- 03:45.500* :  We're hearing reports that the Israeli security cabinet is
*03:45.500- 03:48.260* :  supposed to discuss the Hamas comments later.
*03:48.900- 03:52.680* :  And also that we understand that the Israeli Prime Minister is
*03:52.680- 03:56.420* :  going to speak to the US President Joe Biden as well,
*03:56.420- 03:57.240* :  later in the day.
*03:57.240- 03:59.940* :  And of course, this will be a main subject.
*03:59.940- 04:02.780* :  It's really been the Qataris, the Egyptians, in the region,
*04:02.780- 04:05.960* :  and then the US as well have been leading the mediation effort
*04:05.960- 04:06.260* :  here.
*04:06.900- 04:09.180* :  In the Israeli media, if you look, there's some guarded
*04:09.720- 04:10.720* :  optimism that's being expressed.
*04:11.340- 04:13.960* :  One of the Israeli newspapers quoting an unnamed Israeli
*04:13.960- 04:16.780* :  official, saying that Hamas is no longer demanding that there
*04:16.780- 04:19.740* :  should be a full ceasefire in the first stage of the deal.
*04:20.020- 04:22.980* :  We've had that confirmed to us from a Palestinian official
*04:22.980- 04:26.460* :  who's involved in the talks, saying, though, that there
*04:26.460- 04:29.200* :  are also new conditions, Hamas has added about the withdrawal
*04:29.200- 04:31.640* :  of Israeli forces from this strategically important
*04:31.640- 04:34.080* :  strip of land between Israel and Egypt, the Philadelphia
*04:34.080- 04:36.840* :  corridor, including the Raffa border crossing.
*04:37.240- 04:40.280* :  And so we have to see what the Israelis make of that.
*04:40.280- 04:42.140* :  They say they're going to get back to the mediators
*04:42.620- 04:43.860* :  with their response on the response.
*04:44.440- 04:45.160* :  Yo Land now.
*04:45.800- 04:47.520* :  Well, nine months into the Gaza war,
*04:47.540- 04:50.880* :  there are increasing signs of open dissent against Hamas,
*04:50.880- 04:54.460* :  despite fear of its often brutal reprisals against those
*04:54.460- 04:56.280* :  who dare to speak out against it.
*04:56.740- 04:59.520* :  Residents have told the BBC that people are publicly
*04:59.520- 05:02.360* :  cursing the group's leaders and that some are publishing
*05:02.360- 05:05.340* :  messages online urging them to agree to a ceasefire.
*05:05.920- 05:08.920* :  Many in Gaza are still fiercely loyal to Hamas
*05:09.280- 05:11.880* :  and support for the October 7th attacks is still high.
*05:12.420- 05:13.700* :  But as our Middle East correspondent,
*05:13.700- 05:17.260* :  Lucy Williamson reports, anger against the group is growing.
*05:18.720- 05:21.680* :  In Gaza now, the anger is not just against Israel,
*05:22.460- 05:23.380* :  but against Hamas.
*05:24.240- 05:27.160* :  Scenes like this, unthinkable before the war,
*05:27.800- 05:28.640* :  are growing more common.
*05:30.620- 05:33.660* :  Enough killing, damn you, this university teacher screams,
*05:34.200- 05:37.460* :  your scum, this leadership does not represent us.
*05:40.320- 05:41.020* :  The teacher was filmed after hundreds of Palestinians
*05:41.020- 05:42.980* :  were killed and injured in an Israeli raid
*05:42.980- 05:44.440* :  to rescue hostages last month.
*05:44.500- 05:47.360* :  Some have openly criticised Hamas
*05:47.940- 05:50.560* :  for hiding the hostages in a busy marketplace
*05:52.160- 05:52.840* :  or firing rockets from civilian areas.
*05:53.160- 05:57.660* :  I mean, publicly opposed Hamas before the war
*06:00.300- 06:01.240* :  and was arrested by its security forces several times.
*06:03.880- 06:04.880* :  Now he says people are less afraid to speak out.
*06:04.880- 06:08.160* :  In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done.
*06:10.020- 06:10.640* :  Some people are even calling their livestock
*06:11.160- 06:11.960* :  by the name of certain Hamas leaders.
*06:12.940- 06:16.560* :  It has a lot of support amongst those outside Gaza's borders,
*06:17.140- 06:19.960* :  who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes,
*06:20.780- 06:25.960* :  who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.
*06:25.960- 06:29.540* :  Desperation is eroding social control in Gaza.
*06:29.820- 06:33.820* :  There are those who are not afraid of Hamas.
*06:33.820- 06:36.360* :  There are those still fiercely loyal to Hamas
*06:36.880- 06:39.500* :  and it's hard to assess how many of them are turning away.
*06:40.420- 06:43.320* :  But even some on the group's own payroll are wavering.
*06:44.540- 06:47.820* :  One senior Hamas official, speaking anonymously to the BBC,
*06:47.820- 06:52.700* :  said the 7th of October attacks were a crazy uncalculated leap
*06:52.700- 06:55.660* :  with a devastating impact on Gaza's people.
*06:56.460- 06:58.500* :  I know from my work with the Hamas government
*06:58.500- 07:01.200* :  that it prepared well for the attack militarily,
*07:01.680- 07:04.220* :  but they did not build any safe shelters for people
*07:04.220- 07:07.020* :  or reserve in a food, fuel, and medical supplies.
*07:07.920- 07:09.780* :  If my family and I survive this war,
*07:10.160- 07:12.200* :  I will leave Gaza the first chance I get.
*07:13.680- 07:16.060* :  Hamas is battling for control on the streets.
*07:17.280- 07:19.760* :  It's police targeted by Israeli forces.
*07:22.400- 07:25.860* :  Unofficial security squads have been filmed punishing looters.
*07:29.240- 07:32.540* :  And a well-placed source described bloody scores settling
*07:32.540- 07:37.000* :  with other armed groups in places where Israel's army had withdrawn.
*07:39.020- 07:41.760* :  Before the war, Gaza's sharp political divisions
*07:41.760- 07:44.520* :  were largely hidden under a blanket of fear.
*07:45.500- 07:48.700* :  But fear is only relative to what you have to lose.
*07:51.340- 07:53.240* :  That report by Lucy Williamson.
*07:54.240- 07:57.740* :  The US President Joe Biden is fighting for his political life
*07:57.740- 08:02.340* :  as calls grow for him to drop out of the 2024 presidential race,
*08:02.820- 08:06.460* :  following his dismal debate performance against Donald Trump a week ago.
*08:07.620- 08:10.980* :  After a few senior Democrats publicly started to voice concerns
*08:10.980- 08:15.100* :  that many have harbored in private about the 81-year-old's mental sharpness,
*08:15.580- 08:19.200* :  Mr. Biden held an emergency meeting with Democratic governors at the White House.
*08:19.780- 08:22.260* :  After the meeting, the Governor of New York, Kathy Hockle,
*08:22.280- 08:25.040* :  said she'd been encouraged by what she'd heard from the President.
*08:25.880- 08:26.880* :  I'm here to tell you today.
*08:27.840- 08:30.080* :  President Joe Biden is in it to win it.
*08:30.600- 08:35.360* :  And all of us said we pledged our support to him because the stakes could not be higher.
*08:36.160- 08:38.240* :  On the eve of the 4th of July celebration,
*08:38.940- 08:43.260* :  we talk about how we transition under a monarchy and a tyranny
*08:43.520- 08:45.340* :  that our founding fathers fought against.
*08:45.380- 08:49.200* :  That we risk right now descending back into that very same place.
*08:49.900- 08:52.340* :  We will stand with the President as we fight that force,
*08:52.660- 08:54.120* :  that force being Donald Trump.
*08:55.460- 08:58.380* :  But big donors are also turning against Mr. Biden
*08:58.380- 09:02.160* :  as calls increase for him to release more of his medical records.
*09:02.160- 09:07.120* :  A new opinion poll shows that Mr. Trump's lead over Mr. Biden has widened since the debate.
*09:07.120- 09:10.340* :  With more, he is our North America editor, Sarah Smith.
*09:11.020- 09:13.020* :  The line from the White House is very clear.
*09:13.200- 09:16.440* :  Joe Biden has said in a culture campaign staff
*09:16.440- 09:18.460* :  and it's gone out in a fundraising communication,
*09:18.540- 09:21.380* :  no one is pushing me out, I am not quitting.
*09:21.680- 09:25.480* :  And he has started now making phone calls and having meetings
*09:25.480- 09:29.300* :  with senior party figures in Congress and also with those governors
*09:29.300- 09:30.600* :  who he had into the White House.
*09:31.040- 09:32.840* :  And to all of them as well, he is saying,
*09:32.840- 09:35.900* :  I am the candidate and I'm committed to fighting on.
*09:36.360- 09:39.000* :  But of course, he's talking to them about what concerns they've heard
*09:39.000- 09:41.580* :  from voters trying to allay the worries that they have
*09:41.580- 09:45.640* :  because there is panic rising in the democratic party for sure.
*09:46.000- 09:47.860* :  One of the things people are not very happy about
*09:47.860- 09:49.740* :  is quite how long it has taken him
*09:49.960- 09:52.400* :  to get in touch with them to try to reassure them.
*09:52.780- 09:54.200* :  That debate was on Thursday night.
*09:54.200- 09:56.580* :  It's Tuesday when he first started directly,
*09:56.580- 10:00.300* :  personally speaking to people to try and set their fears at rest
*10:00.300- 10:04.980* :  and the explanations he's offering as to why he performs so poorly in the debate.
*10:04.980- 10:06.740* :  They're not terribly convincing.
*10:07.500- 10:11.920* :  He's saying that he was jet lagged and tired after two trips to Europe
*10:11.920- 10:14.420* :  and that was why he got so confused on stage.
*10:14.420- 10:17.300* :  Well, he'd been back for 12 days before the debate.
*10:17.300- 10:20.640* :  He did a week up at Camp Day with resting and preparing for the debate.
*10:20.640- 10:25.600* :  The idea that he hadn't got over his foreign travel just frankly seems a bit ridiculous.
*10:26.240- 10:30.260* :  So although publicly almost all of the party are still backing him
*10:30.260- 10:34.160* :  and all of those governors came out of that meeting saying he has our support,
*10:35.020- 10:39.720* :  what he's doing to try to reassure them isn't necessarily working.
*10:40.380- 10:44.340* :  And there's real pressure on him to get out there and demonstrate to voters
*10:44.340- 10:46.880* :  that he has got what it takes to be president.
*10:46.880- 10:49.960* :  That's what he needs to do in the next few days if he's to retain support.
*10:50.260- 10:53.500* :  There are no men in gray suits as they used to be called in British politics
*10:53.500- 10:56.460* :  who can come into the Oval Office and tell him the games up Joe.
*10:56.460- 10:58.080* :  It's time to step aside.
*10:58.080- 11:04.220* :  But he is the one who has cast this election as existential for American democracy.
*11:04.240- 11:07.800* :  He says basically the Republic is on the line in this election
*11:07.880- 11:10.820* :  and think carefully about who you choose to vote for as a result.
*11:11.220- 11:13.900* :  Having set the stakes that high,
*11:14.500- 11:18.040* :  it's harder and harder for a candidate who looks like he's losing
*11:18.040- 11:21.360* :  to maintain that he has to be the one who goes into the election
*11:21.400- 11:24.020* :  and it is Joe Biden who casts it in those terms.
*11:24.660- 11:27.860* :  But at the end of the day he's the one who has to make the decision.
*11:28.600- 11:29.220* :  Sarah Smith.
*11:29.860- 11:34.080* :  About financed by the artist and political activist Banksy has been seized
*11:34.080- 11:38.320* :  by the Italian authorities after it was involved in rescuing dozens of people
*11:38.320- 11:40.760* :  from Mediterranean Sea according to its crew.
*11:41.340- 11:43.600* :  The anonymous street artist has called the move
*11:43.680- 11:46.540* :  a vile and unacceptable on social media.
*11:46.900- 11:48.400* :  Stephanie Prentice has this report.
*11:49.320- 11:51.100* :  His identity may be hidden,
*11:51.100- 11:53.500* :  but when it comes to his stance on migrants,
*11:53.620- 11:56.720* :  the artist Banksy has always been out in the open.
*11:58.940- 12:02.840* :  Just last week, an insulation of his was filmed jolting across the tops
*12:02.840- 12:05.360* :  of the crowds at Glattery Festival in England,
*12:05.360- 12:09.200* :  a rubber dinghy full of mannequins shrouded in fabric.
*12:10.100- 12:13.240* :  Now Banksy is criticising the Italian government,
*12:13.280- 12:17.060* :  accusing it of impounding his rescue boat, the Louise Michelle.
*12:19.640- 12:24.120* :  The 30-meter-long Whites and Pink vessel operates around the Mediterranean Sea,
*12:24.120- 12:27.920* :  taking people out to small boats and escorting them to land.
*12:27.980- 12:31.960* :  Its crew say it was during one of these missions that they moored at the port
*12:31.960- 12:35.360* :  of Lampedusa with 37 migrants on board,
*12:35.780- 12:37.100* :  17 of them children,
*12:37.100- 12:40.140* :  but the authorities had ordered them to Sicily.
*12:41.040- 12:44.680* :  Writing on X, the crew said the sea was too rough to follow orders
*12:44.680- 12:48.480* :  and that as a punishment, the boat will be grounded for 20 days.
*12:49.820- 12:53.220* :  Italy's right-wing government has faced criticism in the past
*12:53.220- 12:55.560* :  for restricting charity rescue ships,
*12:55.960- 12:59.700* :  including accusations of orders to take migrants to distant ports
*12:59.700- 13:01.720* :  and away from rescue centres.
*13:02.260- 13:05.640* :  And it's not the first time the Louise Michelle has been stopped.
*13:05.780- 13:09.560* :  It was detained last March after responding to a distress call
*13:09.560- 13:13.060* :  which authorities at the time said violated protocols.
*13:13.980- 13:17.160* :  This time, the Louise Michelle's crew has called grounding the boat
*13:17.160- 13:18.680* :  a political game.
*13:19.640- 13:20.580* :  Stephanie Prentice.
*13:21.120- 13:23.660* :  The British Wildlife Charity, the RSPB,
*13:23.660- 13:27.160* :  says a pair of white-tailed eagles has astounded experts
*13:27.620- 13:30.480* :  by foregoing their opportunity to breed this year
*13:30.920- 13:33.560* :  so that they can look after a chick that was injured last year.
*13:34.200- 13:36.160* :  In a rare display of parental care,
*13:36.240- 13:38.620* :  the two eagles on the Isle of Maldon Scotland
*13:38.760- 13:41.180* :  are continuing to nurse the injured chick
*13:41.280- 13:42.900* :  into its second year of life.
*13:43.000- 13:45.640* :  Here's our science correspondent, Victoria Gill.
*13:46.500- 13:48.440* :  It's a story with a stormy beginning.
*13:48.440- 13:52.100* :  The white-tailed eagle chick injured its left wing in July of last year
*13:52.100- 13:55.320* :  when the nest fell to the ground in unseasonably wild weather
*13:55.500- 13:56.260* :  on the Isle of Mull.
*13:56.480- 13:59.280* :  The island's RSPB officer, who monitors the birds,
*13:59.660- 14:01.640* :  didn't hold out much hope for its survival.
*14:02.120- 14:05.000* :  But this spring, it was spotted alive in a new nest
*14:05.000- 14:07.280* :  and being fed fish by its parents.
*14:07.860- 14:09.860* :  A wildlife photographer has now captured footage
*14:09.860- 14:11.400* :  of the young eagle in flight.
*14:11.400- 14:13.480* :  It has an obvious lump in its wing,
*14:13.480- 14:16.200* :  which appears to be the bulge of a healed broken bone.
*14:16.760- 14:18.940* :  White-tailed eagle chicks normally hatch in April,
*14:18.940- 14:22.460* :  fledg in July and by October are starting to fend for themselves.
*14:22.580- 14:26.360* :  The RSPB says this pair have skipped this year's breeding season
*14:26.420- 14:28.700* :  to tend to their injured year-old chick.
*14:29.000- 14:31.160* :  The charity says this extended parental care
*14:31.160- 14:33.160* :  is unprecedented for these birds of prey.
*14:33.880- 14:34.680* :  Victoria Gill.
*14:37.700- 14:38.740* :  Still to come in this podcast?
*14:39.220- 14:42.620* :  We're basically seeing scams being done using deep-fake videos.
*14:43.000- 14:45.900* :  People being called by family members or police officers
*14:46.600- 14:48.100* :  and basically not able to determine
*14:48.100- 14:49.760* :  whether that's the real person or not.
*14:50.220- 14:52.280* :  Chinese people around the world are being targeted
*14:52.280- 14:54.040* :  by an elaborate phone scam
*14:54.420- 14:57.400* :  in which criminals pretend to be police or relatives.
*15:04.760- 15:06.620* :  As we record this global news podcast,
*15:06.620- 15:09.740* :  one of the strongest storms to hit the Caribbean in years
*15:09.920- 15:12.720* :  is bringing heavy rain and winds to the Cayman Islands.
*15:13.560- 15:15.660* :  Earlier, it left a trail of devastation
*15:16.020- 15:18.340* :  as it hurtled along the southern coast of Jamaica.
*15:24.820- 15:28.700* :  That's the sound of winds of more than 230 kilometres per hour.
*15:29.300- 15:31.900* :  At least one person is known to have died in Jamaica,
*15:32.300- 15:33.940* :  taking the death toll in the Caribbean
*15:34.380- 15:35.900* :  to at least seven so far.
*15:36.740- 15:38.720* :  Carriacco is said to be one of the islands
*15:38.720- 15:41.040* :  most devastated by Hurricane Beryl.
*15:41.340- 15:43.220* :  It's off the coast of mainland Grenada
*15:43.620- 15:45.440* :  and is home to 6,000 people.
*15:46.140- 15:48.400* :  Despite most phone communications being cut off
*15:48.400- 15:50.060* :  are tourist official, Reena Mills,
*15:50.280- 15:52.300* :  managed to call the BBC by driving
*15:52.300- 15:54.200* :  to the far side of Carriacco
*15:54.480- 15:55.860* :  to connect with one of the few
*15:55.860- 15:58.920* :  still functioning Phomas on the nearby mainland.
*15:59.380- 16:01.920* :  There were only three to four houses
*16:02.240- 16:04.080* :  that were speared in my village.
*16:04.560- 16:07.000* :  So my uncle's house is gone.
*16:07.620- 16:09.180* :  My brother's house is gone.
*16:09.600- 16:11.060* :  My sister's house is gone.
*16:11.560- 16:12.560* :  My house is gone.
*16:12.900- 16:15.160* :  Another sister of mine's house is gone.
*16:15.660- 16:18.300* :  And all of us, we are currently at my brother.
*16:18.880- 16:21.680* :  So it's about 20 of us in that small house.
*16:22.340- 16:24.940* :  Well, as the hurricane has moved away from Jamaica,
*16:24.940- 16:28.380* :  the islanders have begun assessing the damage there.
*16:28.800- 16:29.900* :  Our correspondent, Nick Davis,
*16:29.900- 16:31.800* :  is in the J-Making capital, Kingston.
*16:32.500- 16:35.460* :  The thing which has been exactly what I expected
*16:35.460- 16:36.880* :  was this band of rain,
*16:37.280- 16:38.340* :  and it's just been constant,
*16:38.840- 16:42.560* :  and barely not stopping throughout the most of the day.
*16:43.180- 16:45.440* :  And I think that's where we're going to see a lot of the damage
*16:45.820- 16:47.300* :  which has been done to Jamaica,
*16:47.780- 16:50.960* :  not by the sort of almost devastating force of the storm,
*16:51.020- 16:53.980* :  but what's been happening during this rainfall.
*16:54.760- 16:58.640* :  Because we have so many near misses within the region,
*16:58.920- 17:01.580* :  the storms will be left or right,
*17:02.060- 17:03.040* :  north-east, south-west.
*17:03.560- 17:06.680* :  People tend to, well, it may hit us,
*17:06.780- 17:07.700* :  it may not hit us,
*17:08.060- 17:09.520* :  and they tend to stay in place,
*17:09.920- 17:12.760* :  which is kind of part of the information which is told.
*17:12.760- 17:15.260* :  But yeah, low-lying areas people need to get out.
*17:15.520- 17:16.960* :  People often go to shelters,
*17:17.300- 17:18.220* :  set up by the government,
*17:18.220- 17:21.520* :  set up by disaster preparedness organizations.
*17:21.920- 17:23.760* :  But some people don't like that.
*17:24.140- 17:25.220* :  Some people don't like,
*17:25.480- 17:27.140* :  chucked up against people they don't know,
*17:27.640- 17:28.660* :  away from their homes,
*17:28.780- 17:30.560* :  not knowing what's happening in their homes.
*17:31.060- 17:33.100* :  You know, they prefer to risk,
*17:33.640- 17:34.600* :  literally death,
*17:35.380- 17:38.340* :  than not knowing what's happening to their property.
*17:39.320- 17:40.340* :  Nick Davis in Kingston.
*17:40.780- 17:42.700* :  The storm is expected to hit southeast Mexico
*17:42.700- 17:44.120* :  by the end of the week.
*17:45.140- 17:46.420* :  Police in Northern India
*17:46.420- 17:49.500* :  have arrested six organizers of a prayer meeting
*17:49.500- 17:53.860* :  where a crush led to the deaths of more than 120 people.
*17:54.360- 17:56.380* :  Officials say the four men and two women
*17:56.860- 18:00.160* :  who've been detained were key aides of Suraj Pal Singh,
*18:00.560- 18:01.860* :  a former police constable,
*18:02.220- 18:04.540* :  who became a self-styled Indian guru
*18:04.880- 18:07.600* :  and changed his name to Narayan Sakahari.
*18:08.100- 18:09.200* :  Our South Asia correspondent,
*18:09.200- 18:11.360* :  Umbhra Saneti Rajan, reports from Delhi.
*18:11.960- 18:13.380* :  Police in Wuthapradeh said
*18:13.380- 18:15.540* :  all those arrested were volunteers
*18:15.540- 18:18.300* :  of the religious group of the self-styled Guru,
*18:18.540- 18:21.500* :  Narayan Sakahari, a former police officer
*18:21.500- 18:23.000* :  turned spiritual leader.
*18:23.460- 18:26.160* :  They said the six were involved in crowd management
*18:26.160- 18:29.460* :  of the sermon attended by tens of thousands of people
*18:29.660- 18:30.220* :  on Tuesday.
*18:30.860- 18:32.880* :  The preacher, known as Bolly Baba,
*18:33.300- 18:35.900* :  has not been seen in public since the disaster,
*18:36.400- 18:37.980* :  but his lawyer, earlier said,
*18:38.240- 18:40.180* :  he was in his ashram in the state.
*18:40.180- 18:42.660* :  The spiritual leader has not been named
*18:42.660- 18:44.260* :  in the initial police complaint.
*18:44.260- 18:47.760* :  His lawyer blamed anti-social elements for the crush
*18:48.360- 18:49.360* :  without elaborating.
*18:50.140- 18:51.540* :  Umbhra Saneti Rajan.
*18:52.160- 18:54.480* :  Chinese people around the world are being targeted
*18:54.480- 18:56.140* :  by an elaborate phone scam
*18:56.140- 18:58.800* :  in which criminals pretend to be Chinese police.
*18:59.560- 19:01.540* :  A British Chinese woman has told the BBC
*19:01.540- 19:04.700* :  how she handed over her life savings in the belief
*19:04.780- 19:06.060* :  that she was paying bail
*19:06.480- 19:08.580* :  in order to avoid extradition to China
*19:08.580- 19:10.660* :  on fabricated criminal charges.
*19:11.420- 19:12.560* :  As Elaine Chong reports,
*19:12.560- 19:14.760* :  the scammers go to extraordinary lengths
*19:14.760- 19:16.220* :  to trick their victims.
*19:17.280- 19:18.700* :  Early one Sunday last summer,
*19:18.920- 19:20.680* :  Helen Young was woken by the phone ringing.
*19:21.260- 19:22.660* :  Helen, who was an accountant in London,
*19:23.140- 19:24.480* :  thought it was her mother in China,
*19:25.020- 19:25.620* :  but it wasn't.
*19:26.120- 19:26.580* :  Ms. Young.
*19:27.520- 19:28.280* :  Are you Ms. Young?
*19:28.900- 19:30.760* :  I said, yes, what kind of for you?
*19:31.220- 19:32.560* :  The voice on the line told Helen
*19:32.560- 19:34.440* :  that he was a customs officer in China.
*19:35.200- 19:37.400* :  An illegal parcel had been sent in Helen's name,
*19:37.400- 19:39.600* :  he said, but Helen hadn't sent anything.
*19:40.580- 19:42.400* :  And when she was told the call was being transferred
*19:42.400- 19:44.000* :  to the police, she was skeptical.
*19:44.580- 19:45.940* :  How do I know you're a real police?
*19:46.620- 19:47.700* :  Switch on what's up?
*19:48.020- 19:48.600* :  Or we can connect?
*19:48.980- 19:50.340* :  So he connected me that moment.
*19:51.120- 19:52.240* :  When they went on a video call,
*19:52.240- 19:53.840* :  Helen saw a uniformed man.
*19:53.840- 19:57.260* :  He flashed a police ID that said he was called Officer Fang.
*19:57.860- 19:59.460* :  He then gave her a tour of what looked
*19:59.460- 20:01.060* :  like a working police station.
*20:01.700- 20:03.140* :  Things like two, three policemen
*20:03.140- 20:04.500* :  walking there with a uniform
*20:05.420- 20:06.980* :  and the one receptionist there
*20:07.520- 20:09.400* :  with a desk with a police logo
*20:10.160- 20:11.460* :  that looks very real to me.
*20:11.640- 20:14.340* :  That moment, I'm all my suspicions
*20:14.340- 20:15.300* :  and my daughter gone.
*20:16.320- 20:17.680* :  But, moments later,
*20:17.680- 20:19.200* :  they were interrupted by a message
*20:19.200- 20:20.480* :  over the station Tanoi,
*20:20.700- 20:22.960* :  ordering Officer Fang to take a call about Helen.
*20:23.480- 20:24.960* :  Officer Fang put Helen on hold.
*20:24.960- 20:26.060* :  And when he returned,
*20:26.540- 20:27.520* :  he said he had been informed
*20:27.520- 20:29.280* :  that Helen was on their wanted list,
*20:29.520- 20:31.580* :  suspected of a massive financial fraud.
*20:32.700- 20:33.480* :  I said, that's nonsense.
*20:34.220- 20:35.760* :  I never know anything about that.
*20:36.040- 20:37.620* :  He said, but that's your passport number.
*20:38.260- 20:39.460* :  That's your name.
*20:40.580- 20:41.760* :  Officer Fang told her,
*20:41.780- 20:43.320* :  if she believes she was being framed,
*20:43.320- 20:45.640* :  she must help them catch the real crooks.
*20:46.520- 20:48.760* :  Helen was made to sign a confidentiality agreement,
*20:48.760- 20:50.720* :  and she was ordered to download an app
*20:50.960- 20:53.060* :  so the scams could listen in on what she was doing.
*20:53.640- 20:55.520* :  You're not breathing out words to your friends,
*20:55.520- 20:57.280* :  family, to your boss, nothing.
*20:57.780- 20:58.720* :  If you tell anyone,
*20:59.620- 21:02.000* :  you already be interviewed by Chinese police.
*21:02.540- 21:03.480* :  You're lively and dangerous.
*21:04.180- 21:06.400* :  A few days later, Officer Fang rang back
*21:06.400- 21:08.060* :  to tell Helen several suspects
*21:08.060- 21:09.840* :  and now made statements accusing her.
*21:10.200- 21:11.780* :  There was even a taped confession.
*21:15.060- 21:16.160* :  The fake Chinese police,
*21:16.440- 21:17.740* :  so they sent this video to you.
*21:17.940- 21:18.160* :  Yes.
*21:18.880- 21:19.320* :  In the video,
*21:19.320- 21:20.480* :  you see a male suspect,
*21:20.480- 21:22.960* :  apparently confessing in the police interview room.
*21:23.520- 21:24.760* :  Helen could barely believe it
*21:24.760- 21:25.680* :  when she heard the prisoner
*21:25.920- 21:27.500* :  naming her at his boss in the fraud.
*21:29.940- 21:30.760* :  Oh, he just said your name.
*21:30.760- 21:31.140* :  Yes.
*21:31.560- 21:32.140* :  But that moment,
*21:32.140- 21:34.680* :  I was trembling because it's convinced me.
*21:34.920- 21:35.620* :  It's real case.
*21:36.420- 21:37.960* :  And in deeper, deeper, deeper trouble.
*21:40.080- 21:41.660* :  We've taken a closer look at the video
*21:42.080- 21:44.620* :  and because the suspect is wearing a large COVID mask,
*21:44.920- 21:45.900* :  it's impossible to tell
*21:45.900- 21:47.660* :  if what you're hearing matches his lips.
*21:48.380- 21:50.180* :  It would be easy to add a fake soundtrack
*21:50.180- 21:52.400* :  that mentions any name the scammers choose.
*21:53.120- 21:54.160* :  But Helen had been convinced
*21:54.160- 21:55.780* :  she was dealing with genuine police
*21:56.420- 21:57.580* :  and she believed Officer Fang
*21:57.780- 22:00.340* :  when he told her that she was going to be extradited to China,
*22:00.820- 22:02.160* :  even though she's a British citizen.
*22:02.780- 22:03.920* :  You go 24 hours.
*22:04.480- 22:05.120* :  You pack your bag,
*22:05.120- 22:05.680* :  everything.
*22:06.100- 22:07.180* :  Please, you're coming
*22:07.740- 22:09.280* :  to take you to airport.
*22:10.360- 22:12.640* :  This was the moment the scammers had been working up to.
*22:13.080- 22:14.760* :  Helen was told she could halt her extradition
*22:14.760- 22:16.120* :  if she paid bail money,
*22:16.420- 22:17.720* :  so she sent them her life savings
*22:17.720- 22:19.620* :  of more than $36,000.
*22:20.880- 22:21.700* :  But a few days later,
*22:21.720- 22:23.320* :  the fake police were back
*22:23.660- 22:24.760* :  demanding even more money
*22:24.760- 22:27.680* :  or Helen would be on her way to a jail cell in China.
*22:28.380- 22:29.280* :  Helen was in despair.
*22:30.280- 22:31.760* :  I fighting for my life.
*22:32.160- 22:33.220* :  If I go back to China,
*22:33.540- 22:34.420* :  I mean, never come back.
*22:35.120- 22:37.080* :  When Helen tried to borrow the money from her friend,
*22:37.540- 22:38.600* :  he alerted her daughter,
*22:38.960- 22:40.260* :  who told Helen it was a scam.
*22:41.460- 22:42.720* :  Helen's story is extraordinary,
*22:42.780- 22:43.980* :  but far from unique.
*22:44.860- 22:46.460* :  Chinese embassies have issued warnings
*22:46.460- 22:48.380* :  about police impersonation scams
*22:48.700- 22:50.620* :  after a wave of cases around the world.
*22:51.220- 22:53.520* :  The FBI has also issued alerts in the US.
*22:54.440- 22:56.060* :  One woman in L.A. was reportedly
*22:56.060- 22:57.420* :  tricked out of $3 million.
*22:58.780- 23:00.760* :  Experts believe that many of these frauds
*23:00.760- 23:02.400* :  are being run by Chinese criminals,
*23:03.060- 23:05.280* :  operating from countries like Myanmar and Cambodia.
*23:06.340- 23:07.420* :  And there are worrying signs
*23:07.420- 23:09.360* :  the scamming industry is learning new tricks.
*23:10.000- 23:12.500* :  Benedict Hoffman works for the United Nations Office
*23:12.500- 23:13.560* :  on drugs and crime.
*23:14.140- 23:16.340* :  We're basically seeing scams being done
*23:16.340- 23:17.520* :  using deep fake videos,
*23:17.880- 23:19.740* :  and people being called by family members
*23:19.740- 23:20.880* :  or police officers,
*23:21.500- 23:22.760* :  and basically not able to determine
*23:22.780- 23:24.720* :  whether that's the real person or not.
*23:25.260- 23:25.900* :  Back in London,
*23:26.300- 23:28.200* :  Helen's bank refunds it the money she lost,
*23:28.200- 23:30.520* :  but she still has nightmares about her all-deal.
*23:31.300- 23:32.800* :  I feel a bit stupid right now,
*23:33.140- 23:34.860* :  but to think about it,
*23:34.860- 23:37.840* :  there's no chance I can know that's not real.
*23:38.320- 23:39.120* :  It's so convincing.
*23:40.560- 23:41.320* :  Helen Youngbear,
*23:41.340- 23:44.160* :  who was talking to our reporter, Elaine Chong.
*23:45.780- 23:46.920* :  She's only nine years old,
*23:46.960- 23:47.980* :  which has already been hailed
*23:48.040- 23:50.280* :  for her astonishing talent in chess.
*23:50.580- 23:51.740* :  Now, a British schoolgirl,
*23:51.900- 23:52.980* :  Bodhana Sivanandan,
*23:53.040- 23:54.060* :  is set to make history
*23:54.380- 23:55.840* :  as she's become the youngest player
*23:55.840- 23:58.520* :  to be selected to represent England internationally.
*23:59.340- 24:00.700* :  She'll be playing in a chess tournament
*24:00.780- 24:03.140* :  in the Hungarian capital Budapest in September.
*24:03.720- 24:05.440* :  She's almost 15 years younger
*24:05.440- 24:06.960* :  than the next youngest teammate.
*24:07.540- 24:09.060* :  Bodhana and her father Sivan
*24:09.320- 24:11.020* :  spoke to my colleague Justin Webb.
*24:11.840- 24:15.380* :  My first school interested in like 2020 December.
*24:16.440- 24:17.660* :  One of my dad's friends
*24:17.700- 24:19.000* :  was going up to India,
*24:19.000- 24:21.360* :  and he had loads of stuff
*24:21.420- 24:23.200* :  that he had in his house
*24:23.300- 24:24.780* :  and he gave them all to us.
*24:24.940- 24:26.100* :  In one of the bags,
*24:28.040- 24:29.700* :  and I took out the pieces
*24:29.700- 24:31.300* :  and I'm liking them,
*24:31.300- 24:32.940* :  and I wanted to use them as toys.
*24:33.800- 24:34.900* :  But instead of my dad,
*24:34.900- 24:36.840* :  I said that I could play the game,
*24:36.840- 24:38.880* :  and then I started from there.
*24:39.440- 24:41.120* :  Wow. Dad, Sivan,
*24:41.120- 24:42.040* :  that was a good move.
*24:42.760- 24:43.380* :  Yes, yeah.
*24:43.740- 24:44.520* :  It was COVID time,
*24:44.520- 24:45.960* :  so I got three kids
*24:46.240- 24:47.200* :  just to keep her engaged
*24:47.200- 24:48.120* :  with some activity.
*24:48.880- 24:49.660* :  She was asking questions,
*24:49.660- 24:50.300* :  then I said,
*24:50.300- 24:51.100* :  if you're interested,
*24:51.100- 24:51.920* :  you can continue.
*24:52.480- 24:53.340* :  She watched YouTube
*24:53.340- 24:56.120* :  and other online videos
*24:56.120- 24:57.500* :  to continue on the chairs.
*24:58.360- 25:00.340* :  Her interest and passion slowly built up
*25:00.340- 25:01.840* :  and got into the mainstream.
*25:02.300- 25:03.560* :  It must have been thrilling,
*25:03.820- 25:06.500* :  particularly in COVID lockdowns,
*25:06.740- 25:07.960* :  to see that happening.
*25:08.600- 25:09.580* :  In a positive way,
*25:09.780- 25:11.260* :  this happened during COVID,
*25:11.300- 25:12.280* :  although many families,
*25:12.280- 25:13.980* :  that's their own tough times.
*25:15.120- 25:16.200* :  She started playing chairs,
*25:16.240- 25:18.340* :  and part of exactly,
*25:19.280- 25:21.820* :  exactly 2021 July,
*25:23.480- 25:25.020* :  which is like three years ago.
*25:25.840- 25:28.280* :  She started playing over the board in chess first.
*25:28.740- 25:29.160* :  This weekend,

*25:32.660- 25:34.060* :  So just three years,
*25:34.060- 25:36.440* :  and she had her hard work
*25:36.440- 25:39.020* :  and the support from the English chess federation,

*25:50.380- 25:51.240* :  Not really.
*25:51.240- 25:52.540* :  We don't play chess at all.
*25:53.060- 25:53.280* :  Really?
