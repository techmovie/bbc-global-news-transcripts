*01:02.000- 01:08.400* :  I'm Nigel Adely and in the early hours of Friday the 26th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:09.200- 01:13.980* :  The candidates in Venezuela's presidential election have been holding their final rallies
*01:14.620- 01:19.500* :  amid concerns over whether President Nicolas Modordo would accept the outcome on Sunday.
*01:20.260- 01:26.500* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris
*01:26.500- 01:33.340* :  to discuss efforts towards a ceasefire for hostages deal in Gaza. A humanitarian crisis is
*01:33.360- 01:37.820* :  unfolding in Tigray in the north of Ethiopia. We hear from our reporter.
*01:40.800- 01:44.740* :  Also in this podcast, this is an industry that's been under attack in Washington,
*01:46.020- 01:50.340* :  disproportionately so. And so I think it's completely valid for the industry to stick up for
*01:50.340- 01:56.120* :  itself and defend its interests. Why crypto currencies having its say in the US election?
*02:00.180- 02:05.200* :  In a year of election campaigns across the globe, Venezuela's has been particularly
*02:05.200- 02:10.580* :  competitive. Nicolas Modordo, of the socialist party, is confronting his toughest
*02:10.580- 02:17.040* :  electoral challenge since taking office 11 years ago. Opposition leader Edmondo Gonz치lez
*02:17.040- 02:23.080* :  is leading many opinion polls, promising a return to what he calls genuine democracy.
*02:23.840- 02:29.760* :  Mr. Gonz치lez became the surprise opposition candidate after leading political figure Maria
*02:29.760- 02:35.500* :  Carina Machado was barred from standing. She has spent the last few months traveling the country
*02:35.500- 02:45.200* :  calling on people to vote for him. This moment we are living in is an end of a cycle and the
*02:45.200- 02:52.200* :  beginning of a new era. The end of a cycle of chaos to begin an era of order, stability and
*02:52.200- 02:59.320* :  security and an end of violence and a start of an era of peace and respect. However, President
*02:59.320- 03:06.120* :  Modordo has promised to win by rain, shine or lightning. Speaking to supporters in the country's
*03:06.120- 03:12.400* :  second largest city of Mara Cabo, before his final rally in Caracas, he asked what kind of
*03:12.400- 03:22.920* :  president Venezuela wanted. Do you believe in a weak president without energy who's easy to
*03:22.920- 03:29.400* :  manipulate? Do you believe in a savage capitalist president who will privatize the education system,
*03:29.420- 03:33.980* :  the right to health care, and who will privatize the whole of the economy?
*03:34.580- 03:38.520* :  Our America's editor Leonardo Rosha is following these final rallies.
*03:39.200- 03:44.580* :  I think it's been a very odd campaign in very tense, especially from the perspective of the
*03:44.580- 03:50.740* :  opposition. As you mentioned there, Maria Carina Machado basically should campaign for Edmondo
*03:50.740- 03:55.700* :  Gonz치lez. Not only because he's someone with no previous political experience and she is
*03:56.100- 04:02.580* :  well-known name, but also because the opposition were scared that he would be arrested for some reason.
*04:03.520- 04:10.440* :  And whenever she went, she felt intimidated, for example, where she stopped. If she went to a
*04:10.440- 04:16.120* :  restaurant, hours later police would come and shut up that restaurant and asked the people to go
*04:16.140- 04:22.940* :  to the police. It was all sort of intimidation. I think there was tension also on the government side
*04:22.940- 04:30.480* :  because they know it's not going well for them and everyone is wondering if President Maduro
*04:30.940- 04:35.660* :  has been in power for 11 years. His party has been in power for 25 years. It's only natural
*04:35.660- 04:43.320* :  that his is unpopular. Now if he loses will he relinquish power. Many people think that might not
*04:43.320- 04:48.380* :  be the case. And that's the big question. Should he lose? Will there be that piece of that peaceful
*04:48.380- 04:54.500* :  transition? Well, the warnings we're getting from the government is when he talks about
*04:54.500- 05:02.020* :  there'll be a blood bath and just now not long ago he gave a televised address where he said
*05:02.020- 05:08.460* :  asked people to vote for him and that amounts to voting for peace and stability. So it's all sort
*05:08.460- 05:17.280* :  of veil messages about what could happen. There are many people who say he will go or many people
*05:17.280- 05:22.640* :  who say he won't go quietly. You have the United States watching. But an interesting thing here is
*05:22.640- 05:28.840* :  that there's been a split between the right and the left. The opposition is right wing and
*05:28.840- 05:34.100* :  they're conservative. But what's been happening here is that President Maduro has been losing in
*05:34.100- 05:40.060* :  the past month or so the support even from his traditional allies. President Lula of Brazil has
*05:40.060- 05:45.320* :  now criticized him. The former Argentine left wing president Alberto Gonz치lez has been
*05:45.320- 05:52.700* :  uninvited to watch the elections. He's seen as suspicious. And President Maduro has the support
*05:52.700- 05:58.500* :  of Russia, of China, of Cuba. And it's very interesting for the whole region because there's
*05:58.500- 06:04.660* :  is an oil rich country and we want to see what the United States will stand on that. If President
*06:04.660- 06:11.420* :  Trump wins will be a different scenario there for Venezuela. Leonardo Rosha, we've got a lot to
*06:11.420- 06:17.080* :  talk about. That's how President Biden welcome Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the
*06:17.080- 06:23.000* :  White House on Thursday. This was their first face-to-face meeting since President Biden flew to
*06:23.000- 06:29.460* :  Israel last October just days after the Hamas attack to show his staunch personal and political
*06:29.460- 06:36.120* :  support to Israel. That backing hasn't changed. But in recent months he's become more critical of
*06:36.120- 06:41.660* :  Mr. Netanyahu's approach to the war in Gaza, which has caused a huge number of Palestinian deaths
*06:41.660- 06:47.700* :  and still hasn't brought all of the Israeli hostages home. After speaking to Mr. Netanyahu,
*06:47.700- 06:53.540* :  the Vice President Kamala Harris, who will most likely be the Democratic candidate in the U.S.
*06:53.540- 06:59.800* :  election, said it was time for the war to end. What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months
*06:59.800- 07:08.100* :  is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety,
*07:08.140- 07:16.500* :  sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these
*07:16.500- 07:24.020* :  tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb, to the suffering, and I will not be silent.
*07:26.000- 07:30.760* :  Thanks to the leadership of our President Joe Biden, there is a deal on the table for a cease
*07:30.760- 07:37.240* :  fire and a hostage deal. And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal
*07:37.240- 07:43.400* :  done. Our correspondent in Washington Will Grant gave me this assessment of what the meeting
*07:43.400- 07:47.900* :  between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu was trying to achieve.
*07:48.620- 07:53.240* :  So at times he's had a very very close relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu.
*07:53.240- 07:59.720* :  Obviously in the current state of affairs, it isn't as aligned in that he is trying to make
*07:59.720- 08:05.660* :  sure that the final months of his presidency aren't a lame duck presidency, that he actually
*08:05.660- 08:11.500* :  achieved something that he's clearly very keen on achieving in the time he has left, which is
*08:11.820- 08:16.520* :  a cease fire agreement. And Benjamin Netanyahu's role in making that happen.
*08:16.520- 08:21.980* :  There is great distance between them in certain areas, and I think the majority of the discussions
*08:21.980- 08:27.860* :  the two men will have held will have been about trying to make sure that certain demands laid
*08:27.860- 08:34.500* :  laid on by Mr Netanyahu are eased, that there is an understanding that this is potentially
*08:34.500- 08:41.340* :  the best opportunity for a cease fire agreement. We heard from family members of hostages outside
*08:41.340- 08:45.340* :  the White House afterwards, and there did seem to be some positivity from them.
*08:45.520- 08:49.920* :  Yes, they said that the talks had been the most productive and honest they've had,
*08:49.920- 08:56.320* :  that they're more optimistic now than they have been since the very first days in January after
*08:56.760- 09:01.780* :  Hamas took their family members, and that there were no more excuses, no more time,
*09:01.780- 09:07.920* :  Hamas might say yes now, obviously putting the emphasis back on Hamas putting the ball back in
*09:07.920- 09:13.700* :  their court to accept the deal in its current shape. The Prime Minister has also met Kamala Harris
*09:13.700- 09:18.300* :  today and will meet Donald Trump on Friday. How significant are those meetings?
*09:19.200- 09:24.620* :  Well, in terms of Kamala Harris with her becoming the presumptive candidate for the democratic
*09:24.620- 09:31.720* :  party, it does seem like she has a very difficult path to tread in some regards. She doesn't want
*09:31.740- 09:37.660* :  to alienate the progressive wing. She is pretty well aligned with the Biden administration's policies
*09:37.660- 09:43.000* :  of course, but she is also at a moment where she's energising her base, where young people who
*09:43.000- 09:50.080* :  have perhaps been opposed to the Biden administration's policies on Israel are warming to her. So she
*09:50.080- 09:55.540* :  has quite a difficult balancing act in that regard. With Donald Trump, of course, the two men were
*09:55.540- 10:01.820* :  very, very closely aligned for a long time during his presidency, and then they fell out spectacularly
*10:01.820- 10:07.740* :  at the end. It will be very interesting to see the body language the way the two men speak to
*10:07.740- 10:13.700* :  each other. Whatever comes out of that meeting will make for some interesting watching with his
*10:13.700- 10:20.480* :  campaign also emphasising his relationship with Israel, emphasising the importance of freeing
*10:20.480- 10:27.860* :  the hostages. And yes, it's going to be the remaining moments, the remaining hours of what has
*10:27.860- 10:33.700* :  been an extremely controversial visit here in Washington. Of course, just the protests outside
*10:33.740- 10:39.140* :  the White House today show that the emotions still run very, very high on both sides.
*10:39.980- 10:45.900* :  Will Grant, one man who met both President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu at the White House
*10:45.900- 10:51.260* :  today, is Jonathan Dekkelchen. He is the father of Israeli-American hostage,
*10:51.260- 10:56.620* :  Sagweed Dekkelchen, who was captured by her mouse on October the 7th, and has been
*10:56.620- 11:01.960* :  held in Gaza for the past 10 months. Jonathan is part of a delegation of hostage families
*11:01.960- 11:07.320* :  who have travelled to Washington, and before the meeting, my colleague John Donerson asked him
*11:07.320- 11:12.620* :  what message he would be bringing. My message, and I believe the message of all hostage families
*11:12.620- 11:19.840* :  is that the conditions have been met for Israel's security to complete this deal as it is currently
*11:19.840- 11:25.760* :  constituted. The Israeli, military and intelligence communities, up to and including our own
*11:25.760- 11:31.600* :  defense minister, have spoken with one voice that it is time now to sign this deal.
*11:31.600- 11:38.860* :  There is no added value in delaying any more in terms of Israel's security, and every day that
*11:38.860- 11:46.560* :  passes puts the lives of the hostages who may still be alive in danger, and makes it even more
*11:46.560- 11:52.840* :  difficult for the IDF to recover the bodies of the many hostages who have already been murdered.
*11:53.200- 11:58.940* :  Also, by completing this deal, of course, at least signal the beginning of the end of the
*11:58.940- 12:05.500* :  suffering of millions of Palestinians in Gaza. So that is now an issue. It's not about the details.
*12:05.500- 12:10.520* :  It's about Yehres Sinwar, the Hamas side, and Benjamin Netell on Israel's side,
*12:10.940- 12:18.460* :  to really stand out as leaders of their nations looking out for the best interests of those people.
*12:18.760- 12:23.580* :  Now, I think you've already met with the Prime Minister earlier this week in Washington. Was
*12:23.580- 12:28.940* :  that meeting fruitful? No, absolutely not. We were invited to the hostage families that are in
*12:29.420- 12:34.980* :  Washington this week. We're invited to what was supposed to be a sort of intimate meeting with
*12:34.980- 12:40.820* :  the Prime Minister. It was anything but, and honestly, over the course of nearly 10 months now,
*12:41.660- 12:46.580* :  since October 7th, we'll say since October 8th, the day after, it was one of the low points for
*12:46.580- 12:52.660* :  me. He, unfortunately, refused to answer any of the questions that the hostage families put in,
*12:53.180- 12:58.080* :  and instead used it as a kind of, I would say, dress rehearsal, perhaps, for his address
*12:58.080- 13:04.040* :  to a joint session of Congress yesterday. What did you make of that address to Congress?
*13:04.040- 13:09.940* :  That was not in the room, Ionia, chose to not be present in the gallery. For me, it was political
*13:09.940- 13:18.460* :  theater that was mostly directed towards a domestic Israeli audience to convince his own base and
*13:18.460- 13:24.840* :  his coalition partners how widely accepted and strong he is in the United States. I found it
*13:24.840- 13:31.300* :  embarrassing, quite honestly, as an Israeli. Now, he would argue, he has argued that the way to secure
*13:31.300- 13:36.740* :  the release of the remaining hostages is to keep putting pressure on Hamas. What do you say to that?
*13:37.100- 13:44.540* :  Again, I do not consider myself a military expert. His military and intelligence experts,
*13:45.160- 13:51.840* :  the all patriots are saying loud and clear that the added value of perhaps more pressure that
*13:51.840- 14:01.040* :  may have marginal gains in terms of eliminating another few Hamas terrorists is no way measures up
*14:01.460- 14:07.780* :  to the risks of continuing this and the losses of continuing this, this kind of pressure.
*14:08.200- 14:14.700* :  Well, we're 10 months into it. Rafaq has been conquered by Israel. It is time to finish this now.
*14:15.080- 14:22.240* :  And just a final question, how are you doing? How is Segi's wife Avital, their children?
*14:22.240- 14:27.620* :  How are they doing? We're doing the best we can. Avital is a true hero in all of this.
*14:27.940- 14:32.620* :  There are three daughters, one of whom Segi is yet to meet. Avital was seven months pregnant
*14:32.620- 14:38.780* :  at the time of the massacre. She miraculously survived with her two daughters while seven months
*14:38.780- 14:45.080* :  pregnant. They want their father back. And my purpose is to get my son, their father back home,
*14:45.500- 14:50.340* :  along with the now 115 hostages still being held by Hamas.
*14:50.880- 14:57.440* :  Jonathan Dakel Chan, the father of a hostage, held in Gaza. A year after the military coup,
*14:57.440- 15:03.500* :  in Niger, which had been seen as a key ally of the West, the Sahel region of Africa faces
*15:03.500- 15:09.340* :  growing uncertainty. It's sometimes described as Africa's coup belt, given the number of
*15:09.340- 15:15.800* :  governments which have come to power via force. And now, as US and other Western countries withdraw
*15:15.800- 15:21.580* :  from the region, Wagner mercenary groups are seeking to conquer new zones of influence for Russia,
*15:22.260- 15:27.980* :  all in the face of a persistent jihadist threat. Crassi Twig from BBC Monitoring reports.
*15:33.540- 15:37.980* :  A year ago, Niger's president, Mohammed Bazoum, was deposed in a military coup.
*15:38.600- 15:43.560* :  It's just the latest in a series of military interventions in the Sahel, a region that's been
*15:43.560- 15:49.460* :  battling an Islamist insurgency for over a decade. Since the coup last July, there's been a
*15:49.460- 15:55.960* :  sharp uptick in mass casualty attacks, dozens often of Niger troops have been attacked and killed,
*15:55.980- 16:01.720* :  and that's illustrative of the power vacuum. Jacob Boswell is one of our jihadism experts.
*16:02.360- 16:08.200* :  50% of terrorism-related deaths in 2022 came from the Sahel, but there are other threats as well.
*16:08.720- 16:13.420* :  There's climate change, and so you see a kind of confluence of weak governance,
*16:14.240- 16:19.320* :  of genuine local grievances, of resource competition, tribal dynamics as well,
*16:19.320- 16:25.220* :  that make it a very easy place for jihadists to thrive and to spread their extreme version of Islam.
*16:25.660- 16:30.920* :  While the threat from jihadism kept growing, the forces meant to counter it kept shrinking.
*16:30.920- 16:35.600* :  Beverly Ochieng is one of BBC Monitoring's Africa Security Analysts.
*16:35.980- 16:41.060* :  France has completely pulled out its forces from Niger. Its troops left in December just after the coup.
*16:44.920- 16:49.940* :  And the US forces who had been supporting an entire region are now being forced to draw down.
*16:50.360- 16:54.900* :  The last 12 months in the Sahel have seen a continuation of a recent trend.
*16:55.620- 17:01.660* :  Western and international forces mainly out, Russia and some other newcomers mainly in.
*17:02.300- 17:07.160* :  The West has lost a massive footprint in the region. Niger was the backbone of that.
*17:07.840- 17:11.180* :  We know that Russia has been expanding its footprint in the region.
*17:11.180- 17:15.540* :  We also know that Iran is coming in fairly aggressively, and it's because
*17:15.540- 17:20.020* :  Niger has one of the most significant uranium reserves in the region.
*17:20.020- 17:25.440* :  Washington itself has already alleged that Niger has signed a secret deal with Tehran
*17:25.940- 17:31.580* :  to be able to transport about 300 kilograms of uranium, which is fairly significant.
*17:32.240- 17:37.120* :  The rapid withdrawal of the Americans and the swift arrival of the Russians ended up
*17:37.120- 17:44.420* :  creating an unlikely house share at base 101. Different parts of the US drone airport close to Niyame
*17:44.420- 17:48.580* :  are now occupied by US and Russian troops at the same time.
*17:48.900- 17:52.020* :  And the US finally conceding that they're going to leave the country.
*17:52.020- 17:57.380* :  And it's a big loss for them, you know, symbolically, instrumentally, that this ready-made
*17:57.580- 18:01.360* :  drone base, state-of-the-art, will be ready-made for the Russians.
*18:07.320- 18:12.040* :  The Russians have made strides in the Sahel in recent years through the Wagner mercenary group,
*18:12.700- 18:16.480* :  but the death of its leader Yevgeny Prigoshin in a plane crash last year
*18:16.920- 18:22.440* :  through the group into uncertainty. Our expert on all things Wagner is Gleb Borchevsky.
*18:22.780- 18:29.900* :  Wagner itself has been split into at least two groups that are semi-independent of each other.
*18:30.540- 18:33.780* :  One of them is a group that inherited Wagner's operations in Ukraine.
*18:34.260- 18:38.300* :  The other side of Wagner, they call themselves the long-distance branch.
*18:43.020- 18:48.260* :  There's actually active in Africa, namely in Mali, the central African Republic,
*18:48.260- 18:55.140* :  Burkina Faso, and also in Chad. Things, however, do get a bit muddy when we introduce a new name
*18:55.140- 19:01.420* :  into the equation, the Africa, or they are linked to the Russian military intelligence,
*19:01.420- 19:07.560* :  the GRU. Potentially, there are now two different competing organizations in Africa.
*19:24.620- 19:29.340* :  We're effectively run in this country via the Democrats by a bunch of childless cat
*19:29.340- 19:32.460* :  ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made,
*19:32.460- 19:34.780* :  and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable.
*19:35.200- 19:37.920* :  Why Donald Trump's running mate is losing friends?
*19:46.640- 19:51.340* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.
*19:51.600- 19:54.000* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*19:54.300- 19:57.920* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*19:57.920- 20:01.720* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*20:01.980- 20:07.000* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*20:21.040- 20:23.240* :  We all know what that music means.
*20:23.240- 20:26.260* :  It's time for The Olympics in Harris.
*20:26.920- 20:28.980* :  I'm Matt Rogers and I'm Bowen Ye.
*20:29.560- 20:31.240* :  And we're doing an Olympics podcast?
*20:31.580- 20:32.220* :  Uh yeah.
*20:32.220- 20:35.440* :  We're hosting the two guys, five rings podcast.
*20:35.580- 20:41.720* :  Watch every moment of the 2024 Paris Olympics beginning July 26 on NBC and Peacock.
*20:41.940- 20:46.440* :  And for the first time, you can stream the 2024 Paris Games on the I Heart Radio app.
*20:46.840- 20:50.720* :  And listen to two guys' five rings on the I Heart Radio app, Apple Podcast,
*20:50.880- 20:52.280* :  or wherever you get your podcasts.
*20:58.200- 21:03.440* :  A humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the north of Ethiopia, driven by drought,
*21:03.440- 21:08.480* :  crop failure, and the continued insecurity in the aftermath of a brutal war.
*21:09.160- 21:13.860* :  Local officials warn that more than two million people are now at risk of starvation.
*21:14.420- 21:19.700* :  The BBC has gained exclusive access to some of the worst-affected areas in Tigray province,
*21:20.380- 21:25.780* :  and analysed satellite imagery to reveal the full scale of the emergency the region now faces.
*21:26.520- 21:31.420* :  I heard more from BBC verify reporter Peter and why, who is based in Nairobi.
*21:32.020- 21:35.680* :  We have been looking at imagery to see whether we could mark the extent of the humanitarian
*21:35.680- 21:41.320* :  situation in the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, because we have had concerns about the drought
*21:41.320- 21:45.660* :  and the food crisis there. And what we discovered is that it has been an extreme situation,
*21:46.440- 21:50.580* :  where we identified the reservoirs, the people are lying on for irrigation,
*21:51.160- 21:55.860* :  and we noticed that they didn't have any water. But then when you compare a similar period
*21:55.860- 22:01.240* :  last year, we noticed that they had water, and that corresponds with data that we got from the
*22:01.240- 22:06.560* :  Ethiopia's metrological agency, that shows that for the main planting season last year,
*22:06.560- 22:12.280* :  which is between June and September, some part of Tigray and the neighboring Afar region to the east
*22:12.500- 22:16.320* :  had been known a more rainfall, and what that meant is that the reservoirs that should have
*22:16.320- 22:21.240* :  built up with water did not get enough water, and that affected farming activities around those
*22:21.240- 22:26.960* :  reservoirs. So we sent a reporter there who spoke to some farmers, and some of them talked about
*22:26.960- 22:31.540* :  how desperate they were, and in some cases they had to switch their activities,
*22:31.880- 22:35.940* :  like there was one farmer who had been forced to go to temporary jobs in the construction sector
*22:35.940- 22:40.920* :  to get an alive food. You've mentioned the issues that people are having to cope with there,
*22:41.140- 22:45.540* :  and it does appear to be from a distance, a very desperate situation for them.
*22:46.260- 22:49.020* :  Yes, yes, because this is the beginning of the main planting season,
*22:49.600- 22:53.940* :  and then spoke to a regional official in Tigray who told us that this is the peak of the
*22:54.380- 22:58.600* :  the hunger season. So this is when the people there are a little desperate, any need of food aid,
*22:59.320- 23:04.020* :  but because of the conflict that was there, farmers don't have better risers and the seeds
*23:04.560- 23:09.560* :  for them to be able to successfully plant, and then you have thousands of farmers who had been
*23:09.560- 23:14.480* :  displaced during the conflict, and they have been living in incomes, and don't have access to
*23:14.480- 23:18.740* :  their land. And what has been happening is that the government has been on a campaign to try and
*23:18.740- 23:24.060* :  settle these people, and that they have managed to settle people in some parts of southern Tigray
*23:24.060- 23:28.860* :  and the northwestern region, but you still have thousands of people who could be on their farms
*23:29.360- 23:33.200* :  farming and growing their crops, but they're having to rely on food aid for several months until
*23:33.200- 23:39.820* :  a solution is formed. Peter and why? One of the biggest events in the cryptocurrency industry,
*23:40.200- 23:46.420* :  the annual Bitcoin conference, started today in the American city of Nashville. The event culminates
*23:46.420- 23:53.020* :  with a keynote speech on Saturday from Donald Trump. He's been seen as the pro crypto candidate
*23:53.020- 24:00.140* :  during the US election, and the digital donations have been flooding in. Nick Carter, the co-founder
*24:00.140- 24:06.140* :  of CoinMetrix, a company that offers analysis of crypto economic data, explains why.
*24:06.580- 24:11.300* :  This is an industry that's been under attack in Washington, disproportionately so,
*24:11.780- 24:15.740* :  and so I think it's completely valid for the industry to stick up for itself and defend its
*24:15.740- 24:20.280* :  interests. But Donald Trump hasn't always been a supporter of cryptocurrency,
*24:20.540- 24:29.160* :  on New York Business Correspondent Erin Delmore has the story. Not money, volatile, based on thin air.
*24:29.460- 24:35.100* :  That's how Donald Trump used to talk about the world's leading cryptocurrency. He called Bitcoin
*24:35.100- 24:42.500* :  a scam. But now Trump is running as the pro crypto candidate for president, calling for domestic
*24:42.500- 24:47.840* :  Bitcoin production, choosing a running mate with six figures in Bitcoin holdings,
*24:48.480- 24:53.860* :  and being rewarded with millions of dollars in cash and crypto donations from Silicon Valley's
*24:53.860- 25:00.060* :  giants. Their betting on the Trump Vance ticket in hopes that pro crypto talk turns into pro crypto
*25:00.060- 25:06.560* :  policy, if the duo makes their way to the White House. There's nothing new about political
*25:06.560- 25:13.020* :  donations from outside groups. Big money is a big force in presidential elections. But crypto's
*25:13.020- 25:18.040* :  outsider status in the finance industry, and it's targeting by regulators under the Biden
*25:18.920- 25:22.520* :  administration, make the appeal toward Trump strong and deep pocketed.
*25:23.360- 25:30.200* :  What we're seeing now is basically a continuum of the crypto industry doing whatever it has to do
*25:30.300- 25:36.660* :  to buy political friends so that they will prioritize crypto's interest and not the interest
*25:36.660- 25:41.080* :  of the American people. Dennis Keller, her runs a public interest non-profit in Washington,
*25:41.080- 25:46.560* :  and says that the crypto enthusiast stand to benefit as much as Trump, if not more.
*25:46.560- 25:54.480* :  Crypto should be heavily regulated and prosecuted, and instead what we have is the industry
*25:54.480- 26:01.680* :  firing a money cannon to buy politicians to prevent that from happening and to get a very
*26:01.680- 26:09.020* :  favorable regulator with very weak regulations. Trump's keynote address at this year's Bitcoin
*26:09.620- 26:16.780* :  conference could solidify his status as the crypto candidate. Aaron Delmore, video footage of Donald
*26:16.780- 26:23.600* :  Trump's vice presidential nominee JD Vance, referring to Democrat supporting childless cat
*26:23.600- 26:28.980* :  ladies, has sparked a backlash and has been branded sexist and misogynistic.
*26:29.660- 26:35.260* :  This is what he said on Fox News three years ago. We're effectively run in this country via
*26:35.260- 26:40.260* :  the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable
*26:40.260- 26:44.160* :  at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the
*26:44.160- 26:48.760* :  country miserable too. And it's just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg,
*26:48.760- 26:53.060* :  the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.
*26:53.060- 26:57.720* :  And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have
*26:57.720- 27:03.020* :  a direct stake in it? The video is now gone viral, and the Hollywood star, Jennifer Aniston,
*27:03.440- 27:08.800* :  is among those who have responded strongly. A North American correspondent, Nomi Igbal, has more
*27:08.800- 27:14.880* :  details. In the interview with Fox News, JD Vance criticized Vice President Kamala Harris because
*27:14.880- 27:19.820* :  she has no biological children. Ms. Harris is stepmother to her husband's two children,
*27:19.940- 27:25.800* :  but Mr. Vance attacked her and other members of the passer who don't have kids. Friends actress,
*27:25.800- 27:30.560* :  Jennifer Aniston, who has spoken about her struggle with having children and infertility,
*27:30.620- 27:36.280* :  posted Mr. Vance's interview in social media and said, I truly can't believe that this is coming
*27:36.280- 27:42.000* :  from a potential VP of the United States. All I can say is Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter
*27:42.000- 27:47.160* :  is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. Mr. Vance has a two-year-old daughter
*27:47.160- 27:53.980* :  and two sons. Last month, JD Vance voted to block Democrat proposed legislation to guarantee
*27:53.980- 28:01.080* :  access to IVF across America. Nomi Igbal, scientists studying chickens in France
*28:01.100- 28:07.140* :  have found that they blush when they're scared or excited. The researchers are suggesting
*28:07.140- 28:12.220* :  that a discovery could be used to improve animal welfare and farming. The are white reports.
*28:12.800- 28:18.140* :  The scientists at the University of Tur chose two breeds of chicken known for their calmness
*28:18.140- 28:23.860* :  around people. They then studied them in a range of scenarios, some stressful, such as being picked
*28:23.860- 28:30.040* :  up, and some pleasing, for example, being fed. When scared or animated, the uncovered skin on the
*28:30.040- 28:35.480* :  head's heads became red. This includes the comb on the top and the wattles, which are the flats on
*28:35.480- 28:40.640* :  the bottom. Conversely, when relaxed, the hens fluffed up the feathers on their crown.
*28:41.500- 28:46.200* :  The researchers believe their findings open a path to exploring the emotional lives of birds,
*28:46.200- 28:52.180* :  something they say is critical for improving poultry welfare. They conclude that Charles Darwin's
*28:52.180- 28:57.160* :  assumption that blushing is the most human of all expressions has been seriously weakened.
*28:57.960- 29:03.440* :  Thea white. It's that time of year when the nominees for the Mercury Prize hit the headlines.
*29:03.500- 29:09.620* :  It recognizes the best UK or Irish album of the last 12 months. Among those nominated,
*29:09.620- 29:15.840* :  our rap artists, indie bands, and even a pop singer or two. The prize was won last year by jazz
*29:15.840- 29:23.120* :  group Ezra Collective. The BBC's music correspondent Mark Savage told me a similar genre could be
*29:23.120- 29:27.860* :  taken in the title once again. Well, there is another jazz actor, Scottish musician called
*29:27.860- 29:34.360* :  Courto Alto, which is Spanish for short toll. He is the youngest ever graduate of one of
*29:34.440- 29:39.620* :  Scotland's biggest music schools, a jazz trombunist. That kind of sells his music short a little
*29:39.620- 29:45.380* :  bit. It's not just jazz. He chops it up with elements of DJ Shadow and a tribe called Quest. It's
*29:45.380- 29:49.460* :  got a really eclectic feel to it. And then you've got more mainstream people. You've got Charlie
*29:49.460- 29:54.820* :  XCX, who of course has become involved in the US presidential election this week with Kamala Harris
*29:54.820- 30:00.580* :  rebranding her social media campaign in the garish green of Charlie's album Brat. And then
*30:00.600- 30:05.660* :  Corinne Baley Ray, who people probably know from put your records on, that song from about 15
*30:05.660- 30:11.520* :  years ago, but she has changed completely on her new album. It is called Black Rainbows. And it was
*30:11.520- 30:17.260* :  inspired by a visit to a museum of black and African American cultural history in Chicago.
*30:17.260- 30:23.160* :  You mentioned the Charlie XCX and her role now in the American election campaign. That's sort of
*30:23.160- 30:27.320* :  high profile general appeal. Isn't often part of the Mercury music prize.
*30:27.780- 30:31.380* :  I mean, there's always nominations for pop artists. You know, the Spice Girls were nominated.
*30:31.380- 30:36.000* :  Jua Lipa was nominated. They very rarely win. This isn't a prize about commercial success.
*30:36.000- 30:41.740* :  It's about artistic achievement. And there is still a slight snobbery about pop music. Charlie's
*30:41.740- 30:47.540* :  album is really cutting edge. And this record features a lot of very vulnerable and introspective
*30:47.540- 30:52.280* :  lyrics that kind of set it apart. But very few of these records have had commercial success
*30:52.280- 30:58.860* :  only one of the shortlisted records has sold 60,000 copies in the UK. So what does the Mercury
*30:58.860- 31:03.460* :  Music Prize mean? Well, yeah, 60,000 copies, by the way, is significant because that's what you
*31:03.460- 31:09.420* :  need to get a silver disk. Yes. And normally, in 10 years ago, you would have expected people
*31:09.420- 31:13.460* :  on the Mercury Prize to have got gold disks or platinum disks. What happens now is people
*31:13.460- 31:18.860* :  listen to singles and not albums. And that makes the Mercury Prize more relevant because artists
*31:18.860- 31:23.840* :  are very invested in creating bodies of work that tell a story and have a narrative.
*31:24.340- 31:29.300* :  And so this prize shines a spotlight on 12 records that have really achieved that.
*31:29.300- 31:33.280* :  At the same time, you could also argue that the prize is becoming less relevant,
*31:33.280- 31:37.540* :  because that's not what music fans want. And that's not what they're listening to.
*31:37.960- 31:40.780* :  The BBC's music correspondent, Mark Savage.
*31:43.160- 31:47.900* :  And that's all for once for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*31:48.580- 31:52.160* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
*31:52.160- 31:58.140* :  you can send us an email. The address is global podcast at bpc.co.uk.
*31:58.140- 32:04.920* :  You can also find us on X at Global News Pod. This edition was mixed by Nora Hall
*32:04.920- 32:11.540* :  and the producer was Daniel Mann. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Nigel Adely. Until next time,
*32:11.840- 32:12.100* :  goodbye.
*32:25.240- 32:30.440* :  We all know what that music means. It's time for the Olympics in Harris.
*32:31.100- 32:35.400* :  I'm Matt Rodgers and I'm Bowen Yeh. And we're doing an Olympics podcast?
*32:35.720- 32:39.620* :  Uh, yeah. We're hosting the two guys, Five Rings podcast.
*32:39.820- 32:45.940* :  Watch every moment of the 2024 Paris Olympics beginning July 26th on NBC and Peacock.
*32:46.120- 32:50.620* :  And for the first time, you can stream the 2024 Paris Games on the I Heart Radio app.
*32:51.060- 32:54.900* :  And listen to two guys, Five Rings on the I Heart Radio app, Apple podcast,
*32:54.900- 32:56.480* :  or wherever you get your podcasts.
