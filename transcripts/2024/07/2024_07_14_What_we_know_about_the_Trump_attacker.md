*00:51.140- 00:55.880* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:55.880- 00:57.220* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:57.620- 00:58.220* :  They said yes.
*00:58.640- 01:02.640* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*01:02.640- 01:05.000* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?

*01:29.700- 01:30.880* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:30.880- 01:34.300* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Monday the 15th of July.
*01:34.340- 01:39.520* :  President Biden promises a swift investigation into the attempted assassination of Donald Trump
*01:39.520- 01:43.640* :  and announces an independent review of security at the rally in Pennsylvania.
*01:44.280- 01:45.940* :  Mr. Trump calls for unity.
*01:46.500- 01:51.020* :  The Israeli military says one of Hamas' top military commanders was killed in an air strike
*01:51.020- 01:52.380* :  in Gaza on Saturday.
*01:53.040- 01:56.700* :  And Kenyan police say they're investigating a number of motives for the killing of at
*01:56.700- 01:59.380* :  least eight women whose bodies were found in Nairobi.
*02:02.120- 02:09.160* :  Also in the podcast, it could very well be that when he did have the sexual episode where
*02:09.160- 02:13.220* :  he failed, that he feels really miserable about it.
*02:13.620- 02:18.420* :  Tributes are paid to the American broadcaster and sex therapist Dr. Ruth, who's died at
*02:24.180- 02:24.260* :  the age of 96.
*02:24.320- 02:30.060* :  Donald Trump has called on Americans to stand united after he was injured in an assassination
*02:30.060- 02:32.320* :  attempt at a campaign rally on Saturday.
*02:32.880- 02:36.740* :  The former president was hit in the ear as he spoke in the swing state of Pennsylvania.
*02:37.020- 02:40.780* :  One Trump supporter died and two others in the crowd were injured.
*02:41.360- 02:44.400* :  The 20-year-old gunman was shot dead by the Secret Service.
*02:45.040- 02:49.100* :  On Sunday afternoon, President Biden gave a televised address from the White House.
*02:49.380- 02:54.700* :  There's no place in America for this kind of violence or any violence for that matter.
*02:55.500- 03:00.780* :  An assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation, everything.
*03:01.780- 03:06.060* :  It's not who we are as a nation, it's not America, and we cannot allow this to happen.
*03:07.020- 03:14.100* :  Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is important than that right now, unity.
*03:14.760- 03:20.400* :  But some senior Republicans accused the Democrats of raising tensions with recent election rhetoric.
*03:20.460- 03:23.820* :  This was how Speaker Mike Johnson on NBC's Meet the Press.
*03:24.180- 03:26.040* :  Down, we've got to turn the temperature down in this country.
*03:26.040- 03:29.760* :  We need leaders of all parties on both sides to call that out.
*03:29.940- 03:32.720* :  There's no figure in American history, at least in the modern era.
*03:32.720- 03:39.580* :  Maybe since Lincoln has been so vilified and really persecuted by media and Hollywood
*03:39.580- 03:43.220* :  elites, political figures, even a legal system.
*03:43.640- 03:48.320* :  The Republican convention is due to start later on Monday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
*03:48.820- 03:50.840* :  Our correspondent, Edith Talfeeck, is there?
*03:50.840- 03:53.560* :  She told me what she made of President Biden's speech.
*03:54.100- 03:59.100* :  This is very much him putting aside his role as a candidate for the Democrats and becoming
*03:59.100- 04:04.020* :  Commander-in-Chief, hitting a number of key points in that statement.
*04:04.020- 04:09.920* :  First, again, taking the opportunity to condemn political violence, saying it's not American,
*04:10.100- 04:14.300* :  it's contrary to everything we stand for and can't allow it to happen.
*04:14.940- 04:19.560* :  He nodded to the fact that this is a divided nation, saying that unity is an elusive goal,
*04:19.560- 04:24.800* :  but he appealed again for that, saying it's okay to debate and disagree that won't change,
*04:25.360- 04:27.840* :  but they have to be a goal to be united.
*04:28.480- 04:33.900* :  Now he did speak to the fact that there are concerns about how this could have happened.
*04:34.420- 04:39.960* :  He said he's going to make sure that there is an independent review of national security,
*04:39.960- 04:44.380* :  and he will share that with the American people, and that in the meantime, he's going
*04:44.380- 04:48.040* :  to have the Head of Secret Service review all the security measures here where I am at
*04:48.040- 04:53.060* :  the Republican National Convention to see if there needs to be heightened security for
*04:53.060- 04:56.000* :  former President Donald Trump in this entire event.
*04:56.560- 05:03.500* :  So again, him using that role as Commander-in-Chief, he is trying to reassure a nation that
*05:03.500- 05:09.160* :  is still very much shaken, and he's trying to address a number of questions and issues
*05:09.160- 05:13.060* :  that have arisen since that shocking assassination attempt.
*05:13.060- 05:19.340* :  Yeah, President Biden also hinted at the questions that the Secret Service will have to
*05:19.340- 05:24.060* :  answer about how this was allowed to happen, but it does seem extraordinary a gunman was
*05:24.060- 05:28.180* :  able to get so close to such a high profile rally.
*05:28.900- 05:29.200* :  Absolutely.
*05:29.320- 05:35.500* :  I mean, the FBI said it was shocking that the shooter could get near a building just 400 feet
*05:35.500- 05:41.000* :  away from the stage where the former President was speaking, get onto that roof within minutes
*05:41.560- 05:43.240* :  and carry out this attack.
*05:44.200- 05:49.060* :  What we have heard from Republicans is that they have summoned the Head of Secret Service
*05:49.060- 05:51.560* :  to testify on July 22nd.
*05:51.920- 05:59.100* :  They say America demands answers to what happened, but keep in mind, Secret Service, this is their
*05:59.100- 06:04.240* :  kind of number one priority, is protecting the former President, the President, whoever
*06:04.240- 06:04.860* :  they're guarding.
*06:05.500- 06:10.600* :  And so this was a massive lapse in many minds, and so people want to know how exactly
*06:10.600- 06:11.200* :  that happened.
*06:11.660- 06:17.720* :  Neta Talfiq in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, well, the FBI has named the gunman as Thomas Matthew
*06:17.720- 06:22.140* :  Crookes, authorities say that a motive has not yet been identified.
*06:22.140- 06:26.940* :  The 20-year-old lived around an hour's drive from the site of the rally in the town of
*06:26.940- 06:30.420* :  Bethel Park, from where Tom Bateman sent us this report.
*06:33.240- 06:38.180* :  This ordinary suburb of Pennsylvania woke to news that one of their own tried to kill
*06:38.180- 06:39.100* :  Donald Trump.
*06:39.940- 06:45.000* :  20-year-old Thomas Crookes lived here with his parents, now being told their son was dead.
*06:45.700- 06:51.240* :  The FBI and state police raided in the darkness, trying to work out what motivated him and
*07:10.320- 07:10.400* :  whether he acted alone.
*07:10.400- 07:11.140* :  He wrote my son's school bus.
*07:11.320- 07:12.340* :  So what happened to me?
*07:13.160- 07:18.440* :  They said that the state police came to the door and told us that we had to evacuate, that
*07:18.440- 07:21.460* :  there was a state of emergency, and they said there was a bomb on the street.
*07:22.220- 07:27.540* :  The police haven't confirmed a report that explosives were found in the family home, but
*07:27.540- 07:31.400* :  it's known that Crookes followed a website about guns and detonations.
*07:32.820- 07:37.580* :  The FBI is searching the house, they've been here through the night, and a key question
*07:37.580- 07:43.260* :  for them will be over any motive and whether Crookes' politics played any role.
*07:43.800- 07:49.800* :  People show that he was a registered Republican, but he also gave $15 to a progressive or
*07:49.800- 07:54.020* :  liberal campaign group on the day Joe Biden was sworn into office.
*07:56.240- 08:00.140* :  In his high school yearbook, Crookes appears as a smiling teenager.
*08:01.720- 08:07.260* :  One former classmate, he's baffled about what switched for this once diligent student.
*08:07.580- 08:11.680* :  He was always getting good grades on tests, everything like that, he was very passionate
*08:11.680- 08:12.260* :  about history.
*08:12.360- 08:16.980* :  It was nothing out of the ordinary, he was a nice kid, and I had never had an experience
*08:16.980- 08:22.620* :  with him where I was like, he isn't nice, he was always nice, and I was always friendly
*08:22.620- 08:23.000* :  to him.
*08:24.440- 08:28.040* :  America's suburbs were always set to decide this coming election.
*08:28.780- 08:34.700* :  Now fear and angry division is deepening, not because of the ballot box, but the barrel
*08:34.700- 08:35.200* :  of a gun.
*08:36.180- 08:41.020* :  Tom Bateman in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, well images of the aftermath of the assassination
*08:41.020- 08:46.020* :  attempt are going viral while social media is flooded with hate and conspiracy theories.
*08:46.640- 08:50.460* :  For more details, we heard from our disinformation correspondent, Marianna Spring.
*08:50.500- 08:55.800* :  She has created a group of fictional undercover voters with their own social media profiles,
*08:56.300- 09:00.560* :  so she can chart what information they are fed in the run-up to the US presidential election.
*09:00.940- 09:08.060* :  There is an absolute tidal wave of speculation, conspiracy theories, hate disinformation
*09:08.060- 09:13.180* :  of all stripes coming from all kinds of different places, and I actually think part of why
*09:13.700- 09:18.540* :  that is happening, aside from this big unprecedented thing occurring, which obviously lots of people
*09:18.540- 09:23.060* :  are wanting answers and are worried about, is that people can't believe that that would
*09:23.060- 09:27.980* :  be possible or believe that this has happened because they're aware of the usual security
*09:27.980- 09:33.360* :  protocols and other stuff like that, and that's where a lot of the speculation, some of
*09:33.360- 09:37.020* :  the more outlandish speculation is spawning from, because people are saying, well hold on
*09:37.020- 09:41.540* :  a second, how come this was able to happen? And when this happened, later in the evening
*09:41.540- 09:46.520* :  into the early hours of the morning UK time, I obviously powered up my undercover voters
*09:46.660- 09:50.020* :  and started looking at their social media feeds. We know who the undercover voters are,
*09:50.480- 09:54.060* :  our fictional characters with social media profiles across the main different platforms,
*09:54.060- 09:58.960* :  and I'm able to investigate what they're being pushed and targeted with, and all of their
*09:58.960- 10:03.600* :  feeds were overwhelmed with talk about Donald Trump and what had happened at this rally.
*10:04.080- 10:10.160* :  The word staged was trending on X Twitter, people suggesting that this had been staged,
*10:10.160- 10:14.040* :  that it had been planned, you know, all of the evidence available suggests that's not
*10:14.040- 10:17.420* :  the case, but that this was something that Trump had planned were what lots of these
*10:17.540- 10:21.220* :  posts had seemingly falsely suggested, and that was a lot of people who don't like Donald
*10:21.220- 10:24.960* :  Trump posting that people who were left leaning, and then a lot of people who support Donald
*10:24.960- 10:29.720* :  Trump, and certainly some of the kind of very vocal people online supporters were then
*10:29.720- 10:34.000* :  pointing to the idea that this was part of a plot or a plan to harm Donald Trump that
*10:34.000- 10:39.820* :  was beyond any individual shooter, but part of a kind of deep-state cabal, part of other
*10:39.820- 10:43.540* :  conspiracy theories we've heard a lot about in terms of this idea that, you know, there
*10:43.540- 10:47.380* :  are lots of satanic people who are looking to do this kind of stuff to Trump and so on.
*10:47.380- 10:52.460* :  So it's kind of aggravated a conspiracy theory school of thought about false flag attacks
*10:52.460- 10:57.640* :  and staged attacks and so on, and everyone is scrambling around a bit, you certainly have
*10:57.640- 11:01.360* :  that feeling on X, and remember that X is different, certainly that was even two years
*11:01.360- 11:06.080* :  ago, in terms of the kinds of stuff that's allowed and promoted and so on, and there's been
*11:06.080- 11:12.120* :  that real frenzy, and I think my number one tip would be just to interrogate the sources,
*11:12.120- 11:16.280* :  interrogate the posts popping up on your feed, think about how they plan to your own biases
*11:16.280- 11:21.140* :  or views, and just sometimes we have to wait, we just don't always have the answer to all
*11:21.140- 11:21.720* :  of these questions.
*11:22.200- 11:22.980* :  Marianne a spring.
*11:25.580- 11:27.500* :  And still to come on the global news podcast.
*11:28.160- 11:33.020* :  After the first time, the chat is realizing that young people are serious, and I feel also
*11:33.300- 11:35.520* :  the chat hasn't been really on our side.
*11:35.760- 11:38.080* :  They have been sitting on the fence for a long time, actually.
*11:38.580- 11:43.480* :  How young protesters in Kenya are challenging the relationship between Christian leaders and
*11:43.480- 11:44.100* :  politicians.
*11:53.520- 11:54.760* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mintmobile.
*11:55.040- 11:58.900* :  With the price of just about everything going up during inflation, we thought we'd bring
*11:58.900- 12:03.820* :  our prices down, so to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer, which is apparently
*12:03.820- 12:04.300* :  a thing.
*12:04.720- 12:05.720* :  Mintmobile unlimited.
*12:05.960- 12:06.620* :  Premier wireless.

*12:58.220- 12:59.180* :  you get your podcasts.
*13:05.240- 13:09.420* :  We'll have more on the aftermath of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump a little later in the
*13:09.420- 13:11.200* :  podcast, but first some other news.
*13:11.220- 13:16.900* :  Israel says that a deadly airstrike in Gaza on Saturday killed the head of Hamas's
*13:16.900- 13:19.480* :  Han Unis Brigade, Rafia Salamay.
*13:19.480- 13:23.680* :  He was one of two commanders that Israel said it was targeting the other, being Muhammad
*13:23.680- 13:26.080* :  Dave, head of Hamas's military wing.
*13:26.340- 13:28.000* :  His fate remains unclear.
*13:28.700- 13:33.800* :  According to Hamas, at least 90 people died in the airstrike, which had a designated humanitarian
*13:33.800- 13:34.900* :  safe zone.
*13:35.600- 13:38.940* :  I heard more about the significance of the attack from our correspondent in Jerusalem
*13:38.940- 13:39.660* :  Nickbeak.
*13:39.940- 13:44.740* :  Well, the Israeli military are saying, Oliver, that the man they say they have killed,
*13:45.380- 13:51.680* :  the commander of the Han Unis Brigade, is someone who was a mastermind in their words of
*13:51.680- 13:53.100* :  the October 7th attacks.
*13:53.980- 13:59.200* :  And they say that his death significantly impedes Hamas's military capabilities.
*13:59.920- 14:02.120* :  So that is what they've said today, notably.
*14:02.340- 14:06.920* :  They haven't said anything more about Muhammad Dave, the head of the military wing of Hamas.
*14:07.320- 14:12.420* :  Now he would be a much bigger price for Israel, because he's been a top target for decades.
*14:13.280- 14:17.780* :  He's escaped multiple attempts on his life, dating back nearly 20 years.
*14:18.660- 14:20.500* :  And as of now, his fate is unclear.
*14:20.500- 14:25.540* :  Benjamin Netanyahu, last night, the Prime Minister in a press conference, said that the
*14:25.540- 14:27.640* :  information simply wasn't there at the moment.
*14:27.640- 14:31.660* :  But I think striking that today they've said they've killed one of these commanders, but
*14:31.660- 14:33.320* :  not the much more senior figure.
*14:33.640- 14:38.600* :  And of course, this is significant because Hamas are saying, well, the 90 people died yesterday,
*14:39.140- 14:44.360* :  and Hamas say that half of those people were women and children.
*14:45.040- 14:49.040* :  So that would raise questions once again about the proportionality.
*14:49.500- 14:54.520* :  In other words, the price that Israel's willing to pay to eliminate senior Hamas figures.
*14:54.520- 14:59.580* :  Many critics of the way that Israel are carrying out this campaign say, you know, this cost
*14:59.580- 15:00.600* :  is simply too high.
*15:00.920- 15:06.540* :  And what could it mean for the hostage and ceasefire negotiations, which we had been told
*15:06.540- 15:08.900* :  were, were making some progress in recent weeks?
*15:09.160- 15:09.340* :  Yes.
*15:09.620- 15:11.720* :  Well, I think there's a few ways of looking at this.
*15:11.720- 15:17.740* :  Hamas have said yesterday that these recent shrugs have shown that Israel simply isn't
*15:17.740- 15:23.400* :  serious about any sort of ceasefire and a deal in which the hostages taken by Hamas
*15:23.400- 15:25.660* :  or not to over the seventh could be released.
*15:25.900- 15:31.800* :  There are some who think that the killing of high profile Hamas operatives doesn't really
*15:31.800- 15:33.160* :  affect anything on the battlefield.
*15:33.180- 15:38.540* :  However, just reading the Israeli military today, a lot of people assuming that Muhammad
*15:38.540- 15:43.260* :  Dave, the head of the military wing, has been killed, some are arguing that this actually
*15:43.260- 15:48.340* :  puts Israel in a stronger position that maybe Hamas feel weakened and they're more likely
*15:48.340- 15:50.140* :  to go for a peace deal.
*15:50.560- 15:52.200* :  As you say, there were talks last week.
*15:52.660- 15:56.080* :  There was some optimism that maybe they were moving in the right direction, but certainly
*15:56.560- 16:00.660* :  no imminent sign of another round of talks starting in the coming days.
*16:01.280- 16:02.620* :  Nick Beak in Jerusalem.
*16:03.480- 16:08.660* :  Kenyan police say a religious cult or serial killer might be behind the dumping of eight
*16:08.660- 16:12.720* :  mutilated corpses found at a former quarry in the capital Nairobi.
*16:13.300- 16:15.100* :  The eight corpses are all female.
*16:15.600- 16:16.760* :  Richard Kagoey reports.
*16:17.300- 16:22.360* :  The decomposing bodies are found wrapped in plastic sacks, floating at a rubbish dump.
*16:22.900- 16:26.780* :  The search for more bodies is ongoing at the site, which is less than a hundred meters
*16:26.780- 16:28.060* :  from a police station.
*16:28.600- 16:33.040* :  The bodies are being kept at a city funeral home pending post-mortem examinations.
*16:33.680- 16:38.120* :  Police say their preliminary investigation suggests possible links to a religious cult,
*16:38.540- 16:40.960* :  rogue medical practitioners or serial killers.
*16:41.520- 16:44.300* :  This gruesome discovery has horrified the East African nation.
*16:44.720- 16:48.600* :  Kenyan police have come under scrutiny lately, following a surge in cases of mysterious
*16:48.600- 16:53.260* :  disappearances and a lit of duchess during recent anti-government protests.
*16:53.720- 16:54.560* :  Richard Kagoey.
*16:55.060- 17:00.680* :  Kenyan is currently in a state of political turmoil after those huge anti-government demonstrations.
*17:01.420- 17:06.920* :  President William Ruto was forced to scrap a planned tax rise and sack his cabinet, but
*17:06.920- 17:10.260* :  the protests also served as a wake-up call for the church.
*17:10.880- 17:15.000* :  The young demonstrators accused of siding with the government and criticized politicians
*17:15.000- 17:19.400* :  for using the pulpit as a political platform, as Barbara Plattashe reports.
*17:24.820- 17:29.500* :  Hundreds of young people crowded into the Holy Family Basilica on a recent Sunday afternoon.
*17:30.400- 17:35.480* :  Catholic leaders organized this special mass for the youth from Nairobi churches to honor
*17:35.480- 17:38.700* :  those who had been killed by police in the anti-tax protests.
*17:46.720- 17:50.300* :  The service was responding to a movement that is challenging the church.
*17:56.540- 18:01.360* :  Just weeks earlier, Sunday mass was interrupted by chance from the altar of the Basilica,
*18:01.900- 18:07.580* :  an unprecedented protest from young people, the digitally savvy generation known as Gen Z.
*18:08.440- 18:12.340* :  They felt the church didn't back their campaign against tough tax hikes.
*18:13.180- 18:16.580* :  Now, Bishop Simon Camamoy said they had been heard.
*18:17.040- 18:23.900* :  I would like to renew our commitment to serving you, the Lord, for us.
*18:28.980- 18:30.800* :  Do you think the church is taking you seriously?
*18:32.120- 18:37.180* :  I feel like for the first time, the church is realizing that young people are serious
*18:37.780- 18:42.660* :  and I feel also the church hasn't been really on our side.
*18:43.420- 18:45.680* :  They have been sitting on the fence for a long time actually.
*18:46.080- 18:49.500* :  In fact, some church organizations did lobby against the tax bill,
*18:50.040- 18:55.000* :  but it was the protesters taking to the streets that forced President William Ruto to back down.
*18:55.840- 18:56.680* :  And that's not all.
*18:57.000- 19:01.500* :  They're condemning what they see as the cozy relationship between religious and political leaders.
*19:01.840- 19:04.960* :  We believe the president is buying the church.
*19:05.240- 19:06.900* :  He always uses the church as this vessel.
*19:07.440- 19:12.360* :  So the church leaders are seeing their holding envelopes with the executive leaders
*19:12.360- 19:16.780* :  and the prominent members of the government, and that's not what we want as they use.
*19:17.200- 19:18.200* :  Now, it's time to change.
*19:18.300- 19:20.860* :  $50,200.
*19:23.400- 19:27.000* :  One change they demanded, and got, was an end to this.
*19:31.860- 19:35.420* :  Politicians making a show of giving large sums of money to the church.
*19:36.580- 19:39.940* :  Here, a member of parliament hands over bags full of cash.
*19:40.660- 19:44.040* :  Such donations can buy political influence on Sunday mornings.
*19:44.800- 19:47.360* :  Gen Z protesters organized to stop that.
*19:48.140- 19:50.020* :  President Ruto said they were right.
*19:50.580- 19:56.460* :  On matters of politics on the pulpit, I am 100 percent aligned.
*19:56.500- 20:04.640* :  We shouldn't be using pulpit in churches or in any other places of worship
*20:05.100- 20:06.540* :  to prosecute politics.
*20:06.980- 20:08.180* :  It is not right.
*20:08.860- 20:14.080* :  But the president has been part of the political culture, converting the pulpit into a campaign platform.
*20:14.820- 20:18.220* :  His political messages was actually driven within the church.
*20:18.560- 20:22.020* :  So people feel that they have a Christian government.
*20:22.320- 20:27.120* :  Reverend Chris Kenyan-Jewi is General Secretary of Kenya's National Council of Churches.
*20:27.780- 20:31.700* :  He says Mr. Ruto's Christian narrative has made it difficult for many pastors
*20:31.700- 20:33.760* :  to hold his administration to account.
*20:33.760- 20:35.880* :  Our president speaks from the pulpit.
*20:36.420- 20:37.420* :  You know what the pulpit means?
*20:37.460- 20:38.940* :  He cannot be questioned.
*20:39.380- 20:44.940* :  So he has become a very powerful figure in Kenya's politics and church circles.
*20:45.100- 20:51.560* :  The Gen Z are questioning, and I say we don't know the difference between the government and the church.
*20:51.560- 20:56.700* :  The BBC asked for a government response, but the spokesman said he was unable to comment right now.
*20:56.980- 21:06.040* :  Kenya's young people have found a voice, and it's a powerful one.
*21:06.040- 21:11.100* :  They make up the vast majority of the population, but many don't see the country working for them.
*21:11.700- 21:15.760* :  The president is listening to the protesters now, and so is the church.
*21:16.420- 21:20.260* :  We at the church, you know, the church shows that they don't support us.
*21:20.620- 21:24.660* :  We draw away from them, and if there are no, there's no us, there's no the church.
*21:24.720- 21:28.720* :  So we have to listen to our controversy, because we are the church.
*21:38.680- 21:41.300* :  Marraport from Kenya by Barbara Pletasha.
*21:42.140- 21:46.280* :  Tributes have been paid to the American broadcaster and sex therapist, Dr. Ruth,
*21:46.280- 21:48.740* :  who has died at the age of 96.
*21:49.600- 21:53.920* :  Ruth Westheimer was born in Germany, but as a girl was sent abroad for safety,
*21:53.920- 21:56.280* :  her Jewish parents later died in the Holocaust.
*21:56.280- 22:02.260* :  Starting in the 1980s, her ability to talk with good-natured Kanda about intimate sexual matters
*22:02.260- 22:06.840* :  that had long been considered taboo made her a big hit on American radio and TV.
*22:07.600- 22:09.860* :  Vincent Dowd looks back at her life and work.
*22:10.560- 22:16.480* :  Hello, I'm Dr. Ruth Westheimer, and I'm going to answer some of your questions.
*22:16.820- 22:23.580* :  Starting in 1980, Ruth Westheimer had a weekly advice show on radio WNY New York
*22:24.060- 22:25.700* :  called Sexually Speaking.
*22:25.920- 22:27.200* :  This is a serious problem.
*22:27.540- 22:33.680* :  It could very well be that when he did have the sexual episode where he failed,
*22:34.380- 22:37.200* :  that he feels really miserable about it.
*22:37.640- 22:40.660* :  And soon, Dr. Ruth moved to TV.
*22:40.660- 22:45.960* :  Audiences loved her unshockability, her accent, and her sense of fun,
*22:46.440- 22:48.180* :  but there had been traumatic origins.
*22:48.180- 22:53.800* :  Born in 1928 into a German-Jewish family, Ruth Siegel, aged 10,
*22:53.800- 22:58.500* :  could only watch as her father was hauled away to a Nazi labour camp.
*22:58.740- 23:03.940* :  I do remember looking out the window and seeing my father pushed onto a truck.
*23:04.520- 23:09.660* :  He with a faint smile waived and that was the very last time that I did see my father.
*23:10.080- 23:12.260* :  She was sent to neutral Switzerland.
*23:12.260- 23:18.080* :  When in 1941, family letters ceased, Ruth guessed what had happened to her mother.
*23:18.520- 23:22.560* :  Post-war, she moved to America, studying and teaching psychology,
*23:22.560- 23:25.740* :  and the new field of sexual studies.
*23:25.900- 23:27.840* :  Please welcome Dr. Ruth Westheimer.
*23:28.680- 23:33.560* :  On countless chat shows, Dr. Ruth's dispensed advice about intimate problems,
*23:34.060- 23:37.080* :  mainstream TV had never been able to discuss.
*23:37.400- 23:40.140* :  Sexual functioning, and how to become better lovers,
*23:41.140- 23:44.440* :  and how for women to have orgasms,
*23:45.320- 23:48.960* :  and how men not to be premature ejaculators.
*23:50.000- 23:53.400* :  Ruth Westheimer remained in demand into her 90s.
*23:53.700- 23:55.960* :  She'd known awful personal tragedy,
*23:56.420- 24:00.800* :  but Dr. Ruth retained a defiant energy which audiences loved,
*24:01.400- 24:05.000* :  and she had a seemingly irrepressible appetite for life.
*24:07.040- 24:10.520* :  Vincent Dowd on Dr. Ruth, who has died at the age of 96.
*24:11.400- 24:13.980* :  Our travel guides, making a comeback, apparently,
*24:13.980- 24:20.100* :  publishers of them around the world saw 95% of their revenues disappear during the Covid pandemic.
*24:20.700- 24:22.540* :  When there were widespread travel restrictions,
*24:22.540- 24:25.640* :  there were even reports that Google planned to end the print run
*24:26.160- 24:28.840* :  of the revered Fromas Guides in the US.
*24:29.640- 24:31.920* :  But Fromas was brought back by its founder,
*24:31.920- 24:36.020* :  and now guidebook revenues are returning to pre-pandemic levels.
*24:36.020- 24:38.200* :  Julian Warikas spoke to Tony Wheeler,
*24:38.620- 24:41.620* :  co-founder of another guidebook brand, Lonely Planet.
*24:42.140- 24:46.720* :  So, the travellers still want to hold a book in their hand as they explore new places.
*24:47.280- 24:52.920* :  I think these days people have many different ways of gathering the information they want,
*24:52.940- 24:58.000* :  and we all know about using the various internet sources,
*24:58.320- 25:02.040* :  and guidebooks, even when they're the solid form,
*25:02.040- 25:05.600* :  rather than the ephemeral form, it can be print or digital.
*25:06.200- 25:08.480* :  It isn't a question of just being one thing.
*25:09.120- 25:15.860* :  And yeah, people are taking the solid guidebook back into use again,
*25:15.900- 25:16.920* :  which I think is terrific.
*25:17.420- 25:20.420* :  Why? I mean, is it possible to trace that resurgence and where it comes from?
*25:20.800- 25:23.060* :  I think some of it is that, you know,
*25:23.060- 25:24.980* :  a guidebook is completely dependable.
*25:25.440- 25:28.920* :  You never, you're never out of range, the batteries never go flat.
*25:29.500- 25:32.580* :  If you drop it in the river, you can fish it out and dry the pages off,
*25:32.580- 25:33.580* :  and it will still work.
*25:34.140- 25:37.800* :  So, there is that element of it, and two places I've been just in the last couple of months,
*25:37.800- 25:40.420* :  I've been in Nigeria, and I've been in South Sudan.
*25:40.460- 25:45.380* :  Both places were not places where your internet connection was always really good.
*25:46.080- 25:49.480* :  And I found the old fashioned guidebook really worked there.
*25:49.560- 25:54.780* :  The physical guide, you know, has a, it's had a long history, and I certainly said that in two ways.
*25:54.780- 25:57.460* :  One is talking to a lonely planet writers,
*25:57.800- 26:00.600* :  even though I really have no connection with a lonely planet anymore.
*26:00.600- 26:05.600* :  I sold out, I'm long gone, but I do still see quite a lot of the writers.
*26:06.240- 26:09.260* :  And one of the things they were saying, even a year or so ago,
*26:09.260- 26:11.860* :  was that people buying the guidebooks,
*26:12.300- 26:15.020* :  they want to know that it was researched post-pandemic.
*26:15.460- 26:17.380* :  You know, there's a real fear when was that done?
*26:17.860- 26:19.560* :  But this is true, the things on the internet.
*26:19.560- 26:22.320* :  You know, we sort of feel, oh, it's on screen, it must be today.
*26:23.060- 26:26.180* :  It certainly is not. You can find lots of things on the internet
*26:26.700- 26:28.580* :  that are very, very much out of date.
*26:28.820- 26:31.480* :  In the sort of creation of the guidebook of today,
*26:31.980- 26:36.240* :  how conscious are those creators of the apps, of everything else that's available?
*26:36.240- 26:40.560* :  And thereby adjusting what they offer to try and make it slightly different?
*26:41.040- 26:42.340* :  I'll look absolutely they are.
*26:42.340- 26:45.200* :  And I think there are many things, you know, you wouldn't think of,
*26:45.680- 26:48.620* :  I mean, if I want to find out what time the flight goes,
*26:49.100- 26:50.680* :  I go online for it.
*26:50.680- 26:52.940* :  You know, I don't look up in a guidebook, which tells me
*26:53.200- 26:55.800* :  there are three flights a week or three flights a day,
*26:55.800- 26:58.800* :  which we used to do, of course, because that was the only way to
*26:59.540- 27:00.580* :  provide that information.
*27:01.140- 27:05.260* :  So it really does vary on what you're looking for.
*27:05.800- 27:07.280* :  But both things have a place.
*27:08.200- 27:09.940* :  I mean, the good ones, as well, in my mind,
*27:09.940- 27:11.460* :  when I've used them a lot over the years,
*27:11.920- 27:14.920* :  is when you get the sense that the person who's written it
*27:15.820- 27:20.240* :  absolutely lives and breathes this country that he or she is talking about.
*27:20.240- 27:23.180* :  And that's something you can't necessarily get.
*27:23.420- 27:25.280* :  That is 100% correct, that they,
*27:25.800- 27:28.840* :  the so many of the writers, I am just so impressed with
*27:29.360- 27:31.620* :  people's involvement with the places they write about.
*27:31.620- 27:33.180* :  They've spent time there.
*27:33.180- 27:35.880* :  They've studied at university or something.
*27:35.880- 27:37.780* :  They've lived, they've lived it.
*27:37.800- 27:38.960* :  They've lived the experience.
*27:39.520- 27:42.600* :  Tony Wheeler, co-founder of the Lonely Planet Guidebook.
*27:43.480- 27:45.660* :  Let's return now to our top story.
*27:45.660- 27:49.340* :  The failed attempt on the life of presidential candidate Donald Trump,
*27:49.340- 27:53.640* :  who has just arrived in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention.
*27:54.460- 27:58.740* :  On North America, editor Sarah Smith has this assessment of what the shooting means
*27:58.740- 28:00.280* :  for the presidential campaign.
*28:00.840- 28:04.020* :  Donald Trump's raw political instincts were on display when,
*28:04.020- 28:05.500* :  as he was being rushed off stage,
*28:05.820- 28:09.060* :  he deliberately stopped to defiantly raise his fist in the air,
*28:09.780- 28:12.780* :  creating an image that casts as both a hero and a martyr.
*28:13.540- 28:16.260* :  He will almost certainly benefit from an initial boost in support,
*28:16.260- 28:19.780* :  from voters appalled by what's happened and impressed by his response,
*28:20.460- 28:23.820* :  while his supporters are expressing new levels of devotion and admiration.

*28:46.640- 28:50.100* :  The Biden campaign is taking down TV adverts that attacked Donald Trump,
*28:50.600- 28:54.280* :  or Mr Trump's political allies are directly blaming the president for the shooting,
*28:54.720- 28:59.960* :  saying it was inspired by rhetoric that describes Mr Trump as a dangerous authoritarian fascist.
*29:00.560- 29:03.440* :  This is a volatile and frightening moment in American politics.
*29:03.440- 29:08.880* :  This outbreak of political violence will further inflame an already volatile campaign for the White House.
*29:09.420- 29:10.600* :  Sarah Smith in Milwaukee.
