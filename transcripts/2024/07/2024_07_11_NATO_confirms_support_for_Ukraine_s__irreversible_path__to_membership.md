*01:25.220- 01:29.440* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Thursday 11 July, these are our main stories.
*01:30.100- 01:35.380* :  President Biden has promised to defend every inch of NATO territory as he hosts a pivotal
*01:35.380- 01:39.200* :  summit focused on countering Russian aggression in Ukraine and elsewhere.
*01:39.640- 01:42.840* :  He said F-16 warplanes were on their way to Kiev.
*01:43.580- 01:49.060* :  Also, the Hollywood actor George Clooney has become the latest high-profile Democrat to
*01:49.060- 01:52.180* :  the word President Biden to drop his bid for re-election.
*01:52.780- 01:58.580* :  A Ugandan man has been handed a six-year prison sentence for posts on TikTok deemed
*01:58.580- 02:01.000* :  to have insulted the president and his family.
*02:03.300- 02:17.740* :  Also in this podcast, in football England are through to the final of the men's euros
*02:17.740- 02:20.500* :  championships after beating the Netherlands to one.
*02:23.360- 02:24.600* :  We begin in Washington.
*02:25.080- 02:29.440* :  President Biden has vowed to defend every inch of NATO territory.
*02:29.860- 02:33.000* :  Telling leaders of the military alliance, we will do it together.
*02:33.760- 02:39.080* :  NATO was set up 75 years ago as the dust settled after the end of the Second World War and
*02:39.080- 02:43.020* :  Western nations saw a new threat rise up in the form of the Soviet Union.
*02:43.580- 02:47.320* :  NATO faces one of its biggest challenges, the war in Ukraine.
*02:48.000- 02:51.580* :  To those attending a summit in Washington, Mr. Biden had this to say.
*02:52.140- 02:58.420* :  For 75 years, our nations have grown and prospered behind the NATO shield.
*02:59.340- 03:01.960* :  Today, we're stronger than we've ever been.
*03:02.820- 03:07.540* :  Since I took office, we've doubled the number of battle groups and NATO's eastern flank,
*03:07.540- 03:12.860* :  and the United States has. Finland and Sweden have joined the alliance.
*03:13.800- 03:19.700* :  And the number of allies spending at least 2 percent on defense has gone from 9 to 23.
*03:21.180- 03:23.760* :  It's not happened by chance, but by choice.
*03:24.760- 03:29.940* :  From Washington, our U.S. correspondent Tom Bateman reports now on that NATO summit.
*03:30.300- 03:35.160* :  His excellency, Mr. Olaf Schultz, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.
*03:35.740- 03:40.420* :  Leaders from 32 countries gathered for handshakes and a welcome ceremony in Washington,
*03:40.860- 03:46.100* :  where the stifling summer humidity hangs in the air with the clouds of anxiety surrounding
*03:46.100- 03:51.320* :  this summit. It had opened with President Biden stressing the alliance is resolved in the face
*03:51.320- 03:55.660* :  he said of Russian aggression and a claim that NATO has never been stronger.
*03:56.320- 04:01.480* :  The alliance's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the final agreement was a show of unity.
*04:01.960- 04:09.080* :  Today, we decided to adapt NATO's command structure, improve our integrated air and missile
*04:09.080- 04:15.060* :  defense systems, and to go further to much of defense plans with the necessary capabilities.
*04:16.540- 04:22.960* :  All of this has been made possible by historic increases in defense investment across the
*04:22.960- 04:28.840* :  alliance. The agreement pledges what's described as a bridge to NATO membership for Ukraine,
*04:28.840- 04:33.340* :  saying this will be irreversible. The language had been debated for weeks.
*04:33.340- 04:38.520* :  While it is stronger than last year's text which declared that Ukraine's future is in NATO,
*04:39.000- 04:43.460* :  ultimately, it still doesn't offer the kind of timetable which the Ukrainian President
*04:43.460- 04:49.600* :  Vladimir Zelensky wants. In its place, the agreement pledges at least 33 billion pounds of military
*04:49.600- 04:55.240* :  aid for Ukraine within the next year. The U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said deliveries
*04:55.240- 05:01.220* :  of long-awaited fighter jets had started. I'm also pleased to announce that as we speak,
*05:02.020- 05:07.420* :  the transfer of F-16 jets is underway. Coming from Denmark, coming from the Netherlands.
*05:09.880- 05:15.760* :  Those jets will be flying in the skies of Ukraine this summer.
*05:16.260- 05:21.800* :  But Ukraine is worried about what it calls wavering leadership and the chances of a change in
*05:21.800- 05:27.480* :  direction if Donald Trump is elected in November. On the margins of the summit, Mr. Zelensky has
*05:27.480- 05:32.980* :  been reaching out to Republicans invoking the memory of Ronald Reagan, a clear attempt to try to
*05:32.980- 05:38.840* :  sell the case for engagement, not isolationism, among U.S. conservatives. As well as appealing
*05:38.840- 05:44.320* :  to the current president for clearer pledges, he's having to pitch the case for NATO to supporters
*05:44.920- 05:48.060* :  of his rival for the White House. Tom Bateman in Washington.
*05:49.540- 05:55.420* :  Well Joe Biden is facing a lot of scrutiny at the moment with the Hollywood actor George Clooney,
*05:55.420- 06:01.820* :  the latest Democrat to publicly urge him to drop his bid for re-election. Mr. Biden has faced
*06:01.820- 06:07.380* :  growing calls to quit after a shaky performance in a televised debate with his opponent Donald
*06:07.380- 06:13.260* :  Trump last month, on North America editor Sarah Smith reports. The roll call of Democrats asking Joe
*06:13.260- 06:18.440* :  Biden to step aside keeps growing with the first senator added to that list, and now George Clooney,
*06:18.440- 06:23.780* :  who has raised millions of dollars for Mr. Biden's campaign. He writes in the New York Times that
*06:23.780- 06:28.100* :  Democrats will lose in November with his president and says that when he met Joe Biden at a big
*06:28.100- 06:32.600* :  fundraiser three weeks ago, he appeared to be the same man we all witnessed at the debate.
*06:33.220- 06:36.600* :  In a TV interview Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic Speaker of the House,
*06:36.600- 06:40.620* :  seemed to be hinting that she, too, thinks the president should change his mind and agree to step
*06:40.620- 06:45.920* :  aside. She was speaking to MSNBC's Jonathan Lemire. Does he have your support to be the head of
*06:45.920- 06:50.080* :  the Democrats again? As long as the president had the president, it's up to the president to
*06:50.080- 06:58.700* :  suicide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is
*06:58.700- 07:04.020* :  running short. He has said firmly this week he is going to run. Do you want him to run?
*07:04.380- 07:09.980* :  I want him to do whatever he decides to do, and that's that's the way it is. Whenever he decides
*07:09.980- 07:15.120* :  we go in. Joe Biden does have many vocal supporters within the party, including the Democratic
*07:15.120- 07:19.260* :  leaders in the House and Senate. When he's asked if he has the stamina for another four years
*07:19.260- 07:23.440* :  in office, he often replies, watch me. And he'll be hoping to demonstrate his vigor,
*07:23.540- 07:27.940* :  as he hosts the NATO Summit in Washington, knowing he is being watched very closely.
*07:27.940- 07:35.380* :  Sarah Smith, as we heard in the earlier podcast, the Israeli military have dropped leaflets over
*07:35.380- 07:41.360* :  Gaza City, telling all residents to leave and warning that it is about to become a combat zone.
*07:42.100- 07:46.240* :  There are estimated to be more than a quarter of a million people still living there.
*07:46.460- 07:50.780* :  It's the second time people have been told to flee the city since the start of the conflict
*07:50.780- 07:56.620* :  last October. Paul Henley asked David Mensa, a spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister's office,
*07:57.040- 08:01.840* :  why a second evacuation of Gaza City had been necessary nine months after the first.
*08:02.620- 08:08.200* :  Gaza is a pretty small place, and that means that Hamas fighters, the terrorists can move around
*08:08.200- 08:13.680* :  pretty quickly, and they develop this underground terror tunnel network, which is twice the size of
*08:13.680- 08:17.120* :  the London underground, and they've developed that specifically not to defend their own people,
*08:17.120- 08:21.860* :  but to move their terrorists around. Now, just today, you have Galanta, our Defence Minister,
*08:21.860- 08:27.920* :  updated the Knesset our parliament, and he said that we killed or taken off the battlefield through
*08:27.920- 08:34.920* :  injury, about 60% of Hamas terrorists. We think that we've eliminated about 14,000 of them,
*08:35.120- 08:40.080* :  and also the majority of the 24 battalions. Hamas battalions have been shattered, but that
*08:40.080- 08:44.760* :  doesn't mean they've disappeared. Those pieces of those Hamas battalions are regrouping in
*08:44.760- 08:50.560* :  different places, and wherever the IDF and the Israeli army finds those regrouped Hamas terrorists,
*08:50.560- 08:55.780* :  it's got a duty, it's got a duty to Israel's people, it's got a duty to me and my kids and my
*08:55.780- 09:00.240* :  family to destroy them, to make sure that they can't carry out October the 7th ever again.
*09:00.500- 09:06.120* :  But your repeated evacuation order gives the impression to civilians that this could go on
*09:06.120- 09:12.840* :  indefinitely, that the so-called fight to eliminate Hamas is infinite. Paul, it's certainly
*09:12.840- 09:17.340* :  not infinite. The Prime Minister made clear just last week that we're coming to the end of this
*09:17.340- 09:23.560* :  stage of this intensive stage of battling Hamas. We have set out three objectives for this war,
*09:23.560- 09:30.020* :  that is to destroy Hamas militarily and their governing capability to ensure we get our 120
*09:30.020- 09:35.840* :  hostages back, and also to ensure that Gaza can't be a threat to us. We don't mean that means
*09:35.840- 09:42.600* :  eliminating every single Hamas terrorist, but it means breaking open their whole military
*09:42.600- 09:48.700* :  ability to attack us. That's what we're doing. We think we're coming close to the end of this
*09:48.940- 09:55.160* :  particular phase of this war. We don't want to be in Gaza one more day the necessary. We've got no
*09:55.160- 10:00.800* :  grievance against Gaza's people, even though many of them unfortunately support Hamas. We're going
*10:00.800- 10:05.680* :  after this terrorist organization. They will be defeated, but we're doing it not only to protect
*10:05.680- 10:10.960* :  our own people, but we're doing it for garsens as well because they need to be free from this
*10:11.060- 10:15.480* :  menace so they can build a better future for themselves. You're telling people to get out via
*10:15.480- 10:21.220* :  what you call designated safe routes. Are they really safe? There's a lot of evidence that nowhere
*10:21.220- 10:26.740* :  in Gaza is safe at the moment. That's the narrative which media often put forward, but we've
*10:26.740- 10:32.880* :  put a lot of effort into this very often at the expense of our own military's abilities to attack
*10:32.880- 10:38.960* :  the terrorists. What we do is we try and move civilians out of harm's way. It's key to our
*10:39.280- 10:44.720* :  military strategy. It's the reason why even though one civilian death is too many, it's the reason
*10:44.720- 10:50.720* :  why in this conflict, the Prime Minister has said that it's been about one to one, one terrorist,
*10:50.720- 10:55.900* :  one Hamas terrorist to one civilian, which is horrible, but at least it's lower than the UN average,
*10:55.900- 11:01.760* :  which is one to eight or one to seven. We know it's traumatic to move again. It's a horrible thing to
*11:01.760- 11:06.120* :  do, but we want to get them out of harm's way. We want to defeat this terrorist army and we want
*11:06.120- 11:11.620* :  to finish this war and bring our hostages home. There was David Mensa, a spokesman for the Israeli
*11:11.620- 11:17.700* :  Prime Minister's office. Paul Henley also spoke to Sam Rose, director of planning for Unwa. That's
*11:17.700- 11:24.040* :  the UN's body in Gaza. And asked him, what did he make of the Israel military's latest evacuation
*11:24.200- 11:29.380* :  order for Gaza City? We've seen a series of evacuation orders in Gaza City over the past
*11:29.600- 11:34.380* :  several days, starting from the east, pushing people to the west of the city. Then they've received
*11:34.380- 11:39.320* :  evacuation orders from the west of the city, pushing them further west, and now the evacuation
*11:39.400- 11:45.340* :  orders that came yesterday and were reinforced today were instructing people ordering them to
*11:45.340- 11:51.180* :  evacuate south of the Wadi Gaza checkpoint, which has been in place since since October and
*11:51.180- 11:57.220* :  really prevented safe movement north and south, people being instructed to evacuate immediately
*11:57.220- 12:05.300* :  to areas south of that checkpoint. Now, it's still early, it's an evolving situation. We have
*12:05.300- 12:10.100* :  reports of several hundred families that have crossed that checkpoint, but look, the total
*12:10.100- 12:15.940* :  population of northern Gaza above that checkpoint is over a quarter of a million people. Now,
*12:15.940- 12:21.020* :  we're not necessarily suggesting all of these are in the evacuation areas, but there's a real
*12:21.020- 12:25.160* :  potential here that we're talking large, large numbers of people that could be forced south.
*12:25.380- 12:30.940* :  And what do you make of the Israeli description of the routes they have to take as designated safe ones?
*12:31.180- 12:37.720* :  I spent a lot of my time yesterday dealing with a situation in an unrest school in central Gaza,
*12:37.720- 12:42.520* :  where the population that had been sheltering there were ordered to leave the school,
*12:42.520- 12:48.600* :  order to go out into the streets and evacuate. This was a school inside the evacuation area.
*12:48.600- 12:54.300* :  It was a very scary situation for them because the area that they were being told to evacuate
*12:54.300- 12:59.880* :  through was a hot area. It was unsafe, there were heavy bombardments, it was a military area,
*12:59.880- 13:07.540* :  so very difficult for people to evacuate in these areas. And they're not being evacuated and force
*13:07.540- 13:13.480* :  to be displaced for the first time. Many five, ten times they've been forced to move already.
*13:13.480- 13:19.440* :  So they're already burnt out, it's hot, they've got little food, little water. So a very traumatic
*13:19.500- 13:24.660* :  immediately and in the longer term for people to be forced through these routes. And we've had many,
*13:24.660- 13:32.400* :  many cases of people, including staff that I know personally, colleagues and friends who've been
*13:32.400- 13:38.620* :  killed whilst evacuating. The entire Gaza Strip is essentially subject to military operations,
*13:38.620- 13:43.920* :  not as hot as in some of these areas, but very difficult for anyone to move anywhere on any route
*13:43.920- 13:48.820* :  that is safe right now, unfortunately. That was Sam Rose from Unruwa speaking to the BBC
*13:48.820- 13:56.200* :  from Nasirat in central Gaza. When Brazil's president, Lula De Silva came to power last year,
*13:56.540- 14:01.220* :  he accused his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, of carrying out a genocide against Brazil's
*14:01.220- 14:06.840* :  indigenous peoples. Well, now the leaders of those groups have asked the UN to put pressure on
*14:06.840- 14:13.140* :  Lula himself to take urgent action against mining on their ancestral lands in the Amazon rainforest.
*14:13.980- 14:18.060* :  Our America's editor, Leonardo Rosha, told me more about what they had to say.
*14:18.320- 14:22.800* :  What they said, basically, they sounded quite forcefully in their statements,
*14:23.340- 14:29.360* :  is that their communities, the Kaya Paz, the Yanomami and the Mondro Cruz, that their children are still
*14:29.360- 14:35.900* :  dying off preventable illnesses, diseases, that they are still being attacked by thousands of
*14:35.900- 14:42.560* :  illegal gold miners who are still living in their lands and basically taking gold from there
*14:42.560- 14:47.820* :  and other resources as well. And they say the rivers are polluted by mercury, this highly toxic
*14:47.820- 14:54.000* :  metal that's used to, basically to separate gold from the sand. So the situation hasn't changed
*14:54.000- 14:59.000* :  that much and they said the UN should put pressure on the Lula government so that he can do more.
*14:59.340- 15:03.660* :  The expectations on Lula when he came to power were so huge, weren't they?
*15:03.660- 15:08.640* :  And he didn't do an awful lot to downplay those expectations. Now perhaps he's realizing that
*15:08.640- 15:12.600* :  it's harder to change things and turn things around when you're in power.
*15:12.740- 15:17.720* :  That's exactly the case because, of course, the Lula government, they are very committed to
*15:18.160- 15:24.320* :  the indigenous causes and environmental causes. And what he said is in the first week of his
*15:24.400- 15:29.360* :  government, he went to the Yanomami land and he denounced the general side against the Yanomami.
*15:30.020- 15:37.280* :  I think it's much harder to tackle illegal mining than he thought it was. He's also under pressure
*15:37.280- 15:43.100* :  from fiscal balance to balance the budgets and they've been cut to the government budget,
*15:43.100- 15:47.920* :  including to the environment budget. And there are other complications as well, the increasing and
*15:47.920- 15:53.120* :  worrying presence of criminal gangs. Now a lot of these illegal miners are working for the
*15:53.120- 15:58.460* :  PSS as the first command of the capital is the biggest criminal gang in Brazil. So it's a lot
*15:58.460- 16:03.480* :  easier to say that you're going to do than to do it and it takes time. And for these groups to go
*16:03.480- 16:09.300* :  to Geneva to the United Nations and say, look, put pressure on our president to do more.
*16:09.720- 16:14.480* :  That's embarrassing for Lula, isn't it? Well, there's an embarrassment on their side as well because
*16:14.480- 16:19.920* :  they can't openly criticize Lula or they don't want to because they're committed, they're part
*16:19.920- 16:26.440* :  of the government in a way. So it is embarrassing for Lula that he will hear that from other sources,
*16:26.440- 16:31.520* :  the international media will report on that. And then they will compare, probably what the Lula
*16:31.520- 16:36.440* :  supporters will say, well, it was much worse under Bolsonaro who encouraged development of
*16:36.440- 16:41.200* :  indigenous lands and all that. Yeah, but the expectations for the Lula government were very
*16:41.200- 16:46.700* :  different. And that's what these indigenous leaders are saying now that the people are still dying
*16:46.700- 16:52.460* :  in their still danger, Leonardo Russia. Next to the U.S. state of New Mexico,
*16:53.060- 16:59.120* :  there a court in Santa Fe has heard the first witnesses in the trial of the actor Alec Baldwin
*16:59.700- 17:05.480* :  for involuntary manslaughter on the set of his film Rust. The prosecution and jury listened to
*17:05.480- 17:12.320* :  testimony from a responding police officer and watched his body cam footage. During a rehearsal
*17:12.320- 17:19.240* :  in 2021 on the set of the film, the cinematographer Helena Hutchins was killed by a bullet fired
*17:19.240- 17:25.840* :  from a gun Alec Baldwin was holding as part of a scene. His defense deny any wrongdoing and blame
*17:25.840- 17:32.740* :  the weapons supervisors on set. Our Los Angeles correspondent Emma Vardy has been outside the court.
*17:33.300- 17:35.940* :  Her report includes some of that body cam footage.
*17:38.240- 17:41.440* :  Mr. Baldwin, you feeling confident? Is this a fair trial?
*17:42.960- 17:47.900* :  Returning to New Mexico where the shooting happened, Alec Baldwin arrived to face a jury
*17:48.240- 17:50.260* :  who will decide whether he was responsible.
*17:50.260- 17:53.600* :  Is he, were you in the room when not 81? I was on the side of the gun, yeah.
*17:53.640- 17:58.300* :  Okay. All righty. This was the moment police arrived on set of the Western movie Rust
*17:58.920- 18:00.640* :  after a scene had gone terribly wrong.
*18:06.420- 18:12.100* :  The pistol being used by Alec Baldwin had fired a live round, killing the cinematographer Helena
*18:12.100- 18:21.060* :  Hutchins. What's your job there with him? The mystery of how live rounds ended up on the
*18:21.060- 18:27.180* :  film set was revealed earlier this year when the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez stood trial
*18:27.180- 18:32.380* :  for involuntary manslaughter. It was her responsibility to ensure weapons were safe,
*18:32.420- 18:38.780* :  but she had mistakenly mixed up dummy rounds with real bullets. Despite the film's armorer being
*18:38.780- 18:44.540* :  convicted and sentenced to 80 months in jail, prosecutors still believe Alec Baldwin was also
*18:45.240- 18:49.720* :  responsible. They're trying to prove the gun could only have been fired because of his actions.
*18:50.520- 18:55.800* :  The evidence will show that someone who played make believe with a real gun
*18:56.760- 19:02.960* :  and violated the cardinal rules of fire on safety is the defendant Alexander Baldwin.
*19:03.540- 19:08.420* :  Alec Baldwin claims he never pulled the trigger and that it was the responsibility of other
*19:08.420- 19:14.000* :  crew members to make sure the gun was safe. Safety has to occur before the gun is placed in the
*19:14.000- 19:20.240* :  actor's hands. In this case, this unique case on a movie set, the prop gun was placed in Mr.
*19:20.240- 19:26.520* :  Baldwin's hands and cold gun was announced, meaning it had been checked and double checked by
*19:26.520- 19:33.940* :  those responsible to ensure the gun was safe. But prosecutors argue he did not follow safety protocols
*19:33.940- 19:38.880* :  which could have prevented the cinematographer's death. Emabadi in New Mexico.
*19:40.060- 19:44.740* :  Next to football, an England are through to the final of the men's Euro's championship,
*19:45.480- 19:50.780* :  a goal from Oli Watkins in the die minutes of the match in the German city of Dortmund
*19:50.780- 19:57.680* :  gave England a 2-1 victory over the Netherlands. England, who lost to Italy in the final of the
*19:57.680- 20:03.400* :  last Euros, will now face Spain on Sunday. This was the reaction of English fans back home.
*20:03.400- 20:10.740* :  Amazing, they deserve that. We win our final. Oh my god, everything. It means everything to all of us.
*20:10.740- 20:16.400* :  It means everything to everyone. While watching the match with John Bennett from BBC Sport,
*20:16.480- 20:20.320* :  I asked him how big a moment this is in English footballing history.
*20:21.140- 20:25.880* :  It's huge because the England men's team have only ever been to two major tournament finals
*20:25.880- 20:33.920* :  before. 1966, the World Cup Final, which they won. And then in 2021, the Euros Final, which
*20:33.920- 20:39.460* :  they lost to Italy, both of those finals were played in London, played at Wembley. So this is the
*20:39.460- 20:45.480* :  first time that England have reached a final of a major tournament on foreign soil. And I think
*20:45.480- 20:51.020* :  it's massive as well for the Gareth Southgate era. This England manager, we're expecting to
*20:51.020- 20:56.540* :  leave after this tournament. He's been in charge for a long time now. He's had some success,
*20:56.540- 21:02.420* :  but he's been really criticised, particularly in the UK media, for the fact that this England team
*21:02.420- 21:07.180* :  have been a bit boring, perhaps some of his substitutions haven't worked out, but I have to say in
*21:07.180- 21:12.200* :  this game, he got everything right. Yeah, as you were saying there, in previous games this time,
*21:12.200- 21:18.560* :  the victories had underwhelmed people, even though they were victories. This time, it was
*21:18.560- 21:22.960* :  better match, better performance. Yeah, really good performance, particularly in the first half.
*21:22.960- 21:27.360* :  The Netherlands took the lead. Javi Simons with a fantastic goal, but England reacted well.
*21:27.360- 21:31.600* :  One thing you can't question with this England team, they have a real character. A debatable
*21:31.600- 21:36.580* :  penalty, I would say, but Harry Kane tucked it away. And then the Netherlands made it a bit more
*21:36.580- 21:40.540* :  even second half, but that moment at the end for Ollie Watkins. I think what's special about
*21:40.540- 21:44.440* :  that is that Ollie Watkins has been on the sidelines for the whole tournament, really. But he
*21:44.440- 21:49.040* :  gets his chance. Now he's stayed ready. Gareth Southgate is excellent as a man manager. He keeps all
*21:49.040- 21:53.420* :  the players, even who aren't playing, he keeps them happy. He comes on and he's the hero at the end.
*21:53.620- 21:57.440* :  Meanwhile, John on Sunday, it's a bit of a step up for England. They face Spain, they look
*21:57.600- 22:03.000* :  very good indeed. That's going to a stern test. It's a massive test because Spain have got the
*22:03.000- 22:09.220* :  results, but they've also played entertaining football. It reminds me of the teams, the Spain teams
*22:09.220- 22:15.420* :  that won Euro 2008, the World Cup in 2010, and the Euro's in 2012 as well. That was a tick
*22:15.420- 22:19.920* :  attacker football, lots of short passes. It's a bit like that, but it's a bit more direct now.
*22:19.920- 22:25.660* :  They have two amazing wingers in Lumina, Marl and Nico Williams. So they're great to watch. I think
*22:25.660- 22:30.120* :  Spain will start as the big favourites for this final, but you never know. England have a real
*22:30.340- 22:39.940* :  character. John Bennett. Still to come. This is the night mail crossing the border, bringing the
*22:39.940- 22:44.820* :  check and the postal order, letters for the rich, letters for the poor, the shop at the corner
*22:44.820- 22:51.880* :  of the girl next door. In Britain, Royal Mail's famous postal night train is to become a thing of the
*22:59.960- 23:05.080* :  past. John Grisham welcomes you back to Camino Island in his number one New York Times best-seller
*23:05.080- 23:11.840* :  Camino Ghosts. This time, a 300-year-old curse is stirring up more trouble and paradise than ever before.
*23:12.800- 23:16.380* :  Whether you're traveling with friends or family or staying close to home this summer,
*23:16.680- 23:21.620* :  everyone can get on the same page with this intriguing novel that delivers sun, sand and mystery.
*23:22.460- 23:27.360* :  Camino Ghosts is in stores now, also available as an audiobook read by Woopy Goldberg.
*23:28.040- 23:33.060* :  Gail Katz told friends she was leaving her husband Bob, then went missing. On season one of
*23:33.060- 23:37.400* :  the girlfriends, Bob's ex-girlfriends came together to bring him down and seek justice.
*23:37.640- 23:43.040* :  I can't believe this. Now on season two, host Carol Fisher is back, working to solve the mystery
*23:43.040- 23:48.340* :  of another missing woman. It's almost like it's become this moral obligation to find her.
*23:48.440- 23:52.300* :  Listen to the girlfriends, our lost sister. On America's number one podcast network,
*23:52.420- 23:57.300* :  I Heart, open your free I Heart app and search the girlfriends, our lost sister and start listening.
*24:04.660- 24:10.720* :  Accord in the United Arab Emirates has handed down life sentences to more than 40 political
*24:10.720- 24:16.820* :  activists after finding them guilty of terror offenses. United Nations experts and rights groups
*24:16.820- 24:23.420* :  have severely criticized the Mastra. Here's Salina Bill. They were convicted of financing and
*24:23.420- 24:31.220* :  founding a terrorist group that was meant to launch attacks on Neoi's soil. We spoke to the
*24:31.220- 24:36.800* :  daughter of one of those who have been handed down life in prison sentence and she said that
*24:36.800- 24:42.920* :  lawyers have been barred from accessing the case's files and they haven't been able to meet their
*24:42.920- 24:49.520* :  clients. So lots of legal flows according to the critics that have been committed during this trial.
*24:50.180- 24:56.280* :  Salina Bill was staying in the UAE, an Irish woman who was detained by police in Dubai,
*24:56.280- 25:03.320* :  charged with attempting suicide and alcohol consumption. Well now be allowed to return home after
*25:03.320- 25:08.340* :  an intervention by Ireland's Prime Minister. The UAE is one of few countries that still treat
*25:08.340- 25:13.440* :  suicide as a crime. Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs currently lists the country as
*25:13.440- 25:19.240* :  requiring a high degree of caution, advising that there have been several arrests for kissing
*25:19.240- 25:25.180* :  in public and that it's a punishable offense to be drunken public. A reporter, Charles Havelin,
*25:25.180- 25:30.740* :  tell me more about the background to the story. Toy Toy is a woman in her 20s and she had gone to
*25:30.740- 25:36.860* :  the United Arab Emirates only last year to take up residence and work as a flight attendant for
*25:36.860- 25:44.900* :  Emirates Airlines and then her life as a foreigner in Dubai clearly turned sour very quickly.
*25:45.900- 25:51.300* :  The Irish Prime Minister and opposition leader have given quite a few details to Irish parliamentarians
*25:51.300- 25:56.880* :  today and what they said was that she became the victim of domestic violence, very severe domestic
*25:56.880- 26:03.680* :  violence. A campaign group says that she tried to take her own life by strangulating, by strangulation
*26:04.420- 26:08.700* :  when incidents got particularly bad and the next thing she knew that she was that she was in a
*26:08.700- 26:15.760* :  police station and that a charge of attempted suicide was leveled against her. Now the UAE is one
*26:15.760- 26:21.040* :  of relatively few countries where suicide and attempted suicide are still regarded as crimes
*26:21.040- 26:26.460* :  in much of the world they used to be but that has generally been road back on. She was apparently
*26:26.460- 26:35.400* :  charged with that and also with alcohol consumption and was detained and her passport was removed
*26:35.560- 26:40.540* :  and she wasn't allowed to leave the country until the matter was resolved today by diplomacy.
*26:41.300- 26:46.180* :  I suppose this situation highlights the fact that there are a lot of foreign workers in places
*26:46.180- 26:52.240* :  like Dubai and the legal system is very different from the countries that people will have come from
*26:52.280- 26:57.280* :  and it's quite ambiguous as well isn't it legally the status of whether or not you can drink alcohol?
*26:57.600- 27:04.960* :  Yeah the alcohol laws seem to be, many people in the catch 22 situation, they were recently
*27:04.960- 27:11.880* :  liberalized to allow foreigners at least to obtain liquor permits by applying online or going
*27:11.880- 27:17.860* :  to a registered alcohol store or to purchase alcohol in certain state controlled stores but at
*27:17.860- 27:22.780* :  the same time you're not allowed to drink or be under the influence of alcohol in public
*27:23.340- 27:29.900* :  outside one of those licensed premises so it could be seen that people could be quite often
*27:29.900- 27:35.180* :  quite easily trapped by this situation because it might be several hours since they've had a
*27:35.180- 27:39.260* :  drink and they might be found guilty just by dint of there being alcohol in their bloodstream.
*27:39.480- 27:44.560* :  This seems to be one of the criminal charges that was leveled against Tory Tauy.
*27:45.140- 27:51.280* :  Charles Haveland. Do you deserve to be in the job you're doing? Most of us would at least like
*27:51.280- 27:56.520* :  to think that we're where we are because of hard work and maybe a bit of talent so when some
*27:56.520- 28:02.220* :  people are given jobs just because of who they are it is controversial. That's been the case in
*28:02.220- 28:08.620* :  Bangladesh where a quota system has been in place 30% of highly sought after civil service posts
*28:09.060- 28:14.140* :  have been reserved for the children of those who fought in Bangladesh's independence war
*28:14.820- 28:20.980* :  more than 50 years ago. Now the country's top court has come one step closer to ending
*28:20.980- 28:27.520* :  quotas for good. Akbar Hussein, our correspondent in Dhaka, told me about the build up to the ruling.
*28:28.120- 28:34.480* :  Cousins of students, they have been protesting on the streets and they have blocked roads
*28:34.480- 28:42.400* :  at the highways and railways demanding the elimination of any discrimination which exists in
*28:43.120- 28:49.100* :  government jobs because they say that under the quota system which is a kind of discriminatory
*28:49.100- 28:56.020* :  system, students or job seekers, they are being victimized. On the other hand, people who are
*28:56.020- 29:00.160* :  enjoying these quota facilities, they are getting the jobs.
*29:00.520- 29:05.160* :  Disadvantaged groups perhaps are where quotas are concerned, it's understandable but this
*29:05.160- 29:09.540* :  other group, the group who just happened to be children of those people who fought in the
*29:09.540- 29:12.520* :  independence war, they can't be much sympathy for them.
*29:13.120- 29:20.540* :  Bangladesh caught independence 54 years ago. So basically, quota was introduced to give some
*29:20.540- 29:25.460* :  sort of benefits to the freedom fighters son of daughter, immediately son of daughter.
*29:26.280- 29:30.300* :  But now this quota is being applied for the freedom fighters ransom,
*29:31.300- 29:35.260* :  students and job seekers, they think that if there is no quota system,
*29:35.260- 29:41.920* :  that it will be open competition in the job market. So anyone is eligible for the government
*29:41.920- 29:47.200* :  job, they will try for the job, they will give interviews, they will give tests. So whoever is
*29:47.200- 29:52.940* :  competent, they will get the job if there is no quota. So definitely, they will be very satisfied.
*29:53.540- 29:59.780* :  But again, they believe and it is widely believed in the country that whatever the code decision
*29:59.860- 30:05.020* :  would come up, that will depend on the government. The court will take the decision the way
*30:05.700- 30:11.580* :  government wants. So that is the main problem here in the country. That's why students and it's
*30:11.580- 30:16.900* :  still continuing their protest, they do not believe in court verdict. Agba Hussein,
*30:18.200- 30:23.980* :  a Ugandan man has been given a six-year prison sentence for posting videos on social media.
*30:24.520- 30:28.000* :  Now we're considered to have insulted the country's president, you're worried,
*30:28.000- 30:33.720* :  70. The judges also included making vulgar remarks against the president's wife and his son,
*30:33.720- 30:37.740* :  whose head of the army. Our Africa regional editor, Will Ross reports.
*30:37.740- 30:42.220* :  In some countries, you can insult a head of state and get away with it, but not in Uganda.
*30:42.220- 30:47.120* :  The magistrate said Edward Aweibor deserved a six-year sentence so that he would learn a lesson.
*30:47.120- 30:52.580* :  President Ewery M. 70 had already been in power for around 14 years when Mr Aweibor was born.
*30:52.580- 30:56.960* :  The young Tik Tokka is not the first Ugandan to learn the hard way that there are limits when
*30:56.960- 31:01.640* :  it comes to freedom of speech in his country. Two years ago, a writer said he'd been tortured
*31:01.640- 31:06.600* :  in custody for insulting the first family and the activist Stella Nianzi spent time in prison
*31:06.600- 31:14.520* :  after publishing a poem criticizing Mr M. 70. Will Ross. In Britain, Royal Mail will no longer use
*31:14.520- 31:19.900* :  its freight trains to transport post-buy rail. The company is planning to sell them and increase
*31:19.900- 31:26.420* :  the numbers of deliveries made by road. Royal Mail first moved onto the rail tracks in 1830,
*31:26.420- 31:31.900* :  seven years before the reign of Queen Victoria. Then in the 20th century, the special postal
*31:31.900- 31:38.580* :  night train became famous in a poem. Our correspondent Zoe Conway has more on the severing of a historic
*31:42.140- 31:46.520* :  link. This is the night mail crossing the border, bringing the check and the postal order,
*31:46.520- 31:50.980* :  letters for the rich, letters for the poor, the shop at the corner of the girl next door.
*31:51.280- 31:57.300* :  W. H. Ordn's poem Night Mail, written in 1936, celebrated how the night train,
*31:57.400- 32:02.480* :  where posts was sorted on board overnight, was bringing communities together.
*32:11.700- 32:18.100* :  The night trains stopped running two decades ago and even in the day, rail has played an ever
*32:18.100- 32:23.720* :  diminishing role in Royal Mail deliveries. Only three percent of posts now move by rail,
*32:23.720- 32:29.440* :  and whilst the company says some will be carried on the tracks, it's selling off the remainder of
*32:29.440- 32:34.920* :  its freight trains. Royal Mail says it will increase the number of deliveries made by road
*32:35.360- 32:41.200* :  and claims that its large electric fleet of vehicles and use of biofuel makes it the greenest
*32:41.200- 32:47.620* :  delivery company in the UK. Zoe Conway, a growing number of cities in Europe,
*32:47.620- 32:53.580* :  have been introducing measures to curb mass tourism. Visitors to the Italian city of Venice now
*32:53.580- 32:59.420* :  have to pay a fee for a day trip, and residents in Barcelona and Spain got so fed up with tourists
*32:59.420- 33:05.240* :  that they started spraying them with water pistols recently. Now, Greece has brought in regulations
*33:05.240- 33:10.400* :  to limit the areas on beaches that bars and restaurants can use. They're intended to leave
*33:10.400- 33:15.460* :  enough space for the public who have complained about exorbitant prices charged by beachfront
*33:15.460- 33:19.800* :  businesses that restrict their free access. Mark Loin reports.
*33:25.200- 33:33.060* :  Ah, a Greek summer. Island hopping, Uzo at sunset, and often a scramble to find a patch of sand
*33:33.060- 33:40.200* :  to lay your towel amid sunbeds that cost the earth. But now Greece is cracking down on beach hoggers
*33:40.520- 33:45.700* :  issuing new rules for seafront businesses. Their tables and sunbeds must be at least four
