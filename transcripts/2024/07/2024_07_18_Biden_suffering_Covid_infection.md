*00:50.800- 00:55.720* :  allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising prices
*00:55.720- 01:00.740* :  technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said, what the **** are you talking about?

*01:24.980- 01:28.200* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Thursday,
*01:28.200- 01:34.180* :  the 18th of July. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff calls on Joe Biden to abandon his re-election
*01:34.180- 01:38.200* :  campaign. But is there anything that could persuade the president to step down?
*01:45.280- 01:49.920* :  As we record this podcast, President Biden has just tested positive for COVID.
*01:52.240- 01:57.000* :  Also in the podcast, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh promises justice for six students killed
*01:57.000- 02:02.620* :  during protests. The Caribbean island of Karyaku struggles to cope with the aftermath of
*02:02.620- 02:09.440* :  Hurricane Barrel. It's truly heartbreaking. 98% of properties of homes, infrastructure has
*02:09.440- 02:16.620* :  either been destroyed or damaged on an island of just 10,000 people. And it turns off the
*02:16.620- 02:22.420* :  interleuking leaven signal. So when you turn off interleuking a leaven, you turn off their aging switches.
*02:22.940- 02:25.980* :  Have scientists found the secret to extending life?
*02:29.680- 02:35.280* :  In the days after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, the Democratic effort to replace Joe Biden
*02:35.280- 02:40.360* :  as their presidential candidates went quiet. Now, though, the campaign appears to have
*02:40.360- 02:45.140* :  resumed in earnest with Congressman Adam Schiff becoming one of the most senior Democrats yet
*02:45.140- 02:50.900* :  to call on the president to stand aside. Mr. Biden resumed campaigning a few days ago and
*02:50.900- 02:56.380* :  continues to insist he is the best person to take on Donald Trump. However, in an interview with
*02:56.380- 03:01.800* :  the black media outlet BET, he has said for the first time that if he was found to be ill,
*03:02.120- 03:03.040* :  he could step down.
*03:15.040- 03:18.480* :  Look, I originally ran and I said I was going to be a transitional candidate.
*03:19.120- 03:22.740* :  And I thought that I'd be able to move from this just to pass it on to someone else.
*03:23.400- 03:30.220* :  But I didn't anticipate things getting so, so, so divided. And quite frankly, I think
*03:31.180- 03:36.020* :  the only thing age brings a little bit of wisdom. And I think I've demonstrated that I know how to
*03:36.020- 03:41.560* :  get things done for the country. But there's more to do and I'm reluctant to walk away from that.
*03:42.060- 03:47.240* :  His comment about stepping down is in marked contrast to the interview with ABC news earlier
*03:47.240- 03:53.020* :  this month when he said only the Lord Almighty would get him to leave the race. Our correspondent
*03:53.040- 03:57.560* :  Nomiya Ikbal is in Milwaukee where the Republicans are holding their national convention.
*03:58.280- 04:01.340* :  I asked her first what she made of what Joe Biden had said.
*04:02.080- 04:08.560* :  Well, it's so a crack in his armor, isn't it? It's the first time that we have got an insight into
*04:09.700- 04:15.720* :  to how he's feeling about this, this pressure on him to step aside. It had gone away for a while
*04:15.720- 04:19.180* :  following that assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Donald Trump became the focus again.
*04:19.700- 04:24.080* :  But now there is this renewed pressure. I think Adam Schiff coming out is very significant.
*04:24.900- 04:31.100* :  But it does show that Joe Biden recognises that there might be a situation in which he could
*04:31.100- 04:35.460* :  step aside. But it was a big if, at the end of the day, he's saying he'll early step aside if
*04:35.500- 04:38.780* :  there are extraordinary circumstances which are forcing to do so.
*04:39.600- 04:44.940* :  And I'm just seeing reports that President Biden has cancelled his speech in Las Vegas because
*04:44.940- 04:50.760* :  he has tested positive for Covid numerous reports of that coming in. That's going to make it
*04:50.760- 04:54.560* :  obviously much harder for him to campaign and win over his doubters.
*04:55.040- 05:01.260* :  I think you'll also concern people as well because Covid is something that people forget that
*05:01.260- 05:07.620* :  still exists. He's had Covid before and he's been fine. But I think given his age, given his
*05:07.620- 05:12.100* :  fragility, given that there are already these huge questions about his health, it will just add
*05:12.100- 05:17.220* :  even more to the concern that people have regarding him. Now we can hear the hubbub of the
*05:17.220- 05:21.880* :  Republican National Convention behind you day three. Today we'll see Donald Trump's running
*05:21.880- 05:27.920* :  mate JD Vance making his primetime debut with a big speech in a few hours time. And here he is
*05:27.920- 05:33.320* :  joking about it a little earlier. I joke with the president that I'm very excited about this
*05:33.320- 05:38.780* :  evening and I don't plan to screw it up. But if I do, it's too late. He made the pic, right?
*05:38.780- 05:45.000* :  It's official now. So Nomi, what should we expect from JD Vance as he introduces himself to the
*05:45.000- 05:51.580* :  American public? It's really funny. He made that comment because Donald Trump is very much known
*05:51.580- 05:56.840* :  for getting rid of members of his staff if he doesn't agree with them. So I'm sure of JD Vance
*05:56.840- 06:01.780* :  suddenly stepped out of line. Donald Trump might change his mind, but let's see. So right now I'm
*06:01.780- 06:07.360* :  in the Convention Centre. There are thousands of delegates who are here, thousands of members of
*06:07.360- 06:13.240* :  the Republican Party. I'm actually sat in the seating area behind where Donald Trump and his
*06:13.240- 06:19.620* :  family will be sat later tonight to watch JD Vance give his speech. Big moment for him. He's only
*06:19.620- 06:25.960* :  been in politics for just two years. As a senator for Ohio, he's a young guy, 39 years of age,
*06:25.960- 06:30.580* :  and of course so much has been said, hasn't it, about how, once upon a time, he was a Trump
*06:30.580- 06:35.800* :  hater. Now he's a Trump loyalist. It'll be interesting to see if he refers to any of that because
*06:35.800- 06:43.000* :  he constantly gets asked about it. I think we will see him fully aligned with the Trump agenda,
*06:43.040- 06:48.920* :  the hardline policies, and also that we might hear something about him in regards to foreign
*06:48.920- 06:55.420* :  policy, but what we'll see is a complete and utter dedication to Donald Trump. You know,
*06:56.040- 07:02.740* :  JD Vance has sensed where the Trump voters are, and he's made a power play for them because I think
*07:03.380- 07:07.580* :  JD Vance is now being seen as the heir apparent to Donald Trump.
*07:08.420- 07:13.020* :  Nomiya Iqbal at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in Wisconsin.
*07:14.120- 07:19.120* :  Meanwhile, Eric Trump has spoken out in defense of the US Secret Service following the assassination
*07:19.120- 07:24.520* :  attempt on his father, the agency is facing criticism over the security failings that allowed the
*07:24.520- 07:29.240* :  attack to happen. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security has launched an
*07:29.240- 07:34.660* :  investigation on North America editor Sarah Smith reports. The head of the Secret Service,
*07:34.660- 07:39.260* :  Kimberly Cheetle is facing growing calls for her to be sacked, as questions mount about how a
*07:39.260- 07:44.580* :  government came so close to killing former President Trump. Multiple investigations have been launched,
*07:45.060- 07:48.300* :  and Miss Cheetle will be questioned in front of two congressional hearings next week.
*07:49.220- 07:54.000* :  One focus is likely to be her comments in an interview with ABC News that health and safety
*07:54.000- 07:58.700* :  was a factor in the security labs. The snipers were not stationed on the roof used by the
*07:58.700- 08:04.280* :  government because it was sloped. That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point,
*08:05.160- 08:08.880* :  and so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to
*08:08.880- 08:14.200* :  put somebody up on a sloped roof. And so, you know, the decision was made to secure the building
*08:14.860- 08:18.920* :  from inside. There's been praise for the agents closest to Donald Trump who rushed him off the
*08:18.920- 08:23.640* :  stage after the shooting, including from his son Eric. Eric, incredible, incredible people.
*08:24.000- 08:27.600* :  The real abs is the fact that the US Secret Service director yesterday come out and say that the
*08:27.600- 08:32.160* :  roof was so steep that they didn't want to put assets on that roof and the roof was like this.
*08:32.240- 08:34.440* :  I mean, my four-year-old daughter could have walked up that roof. And so,
*08:35.580- 08:39.260* :  it infuriates me when they when they talk to people on his team, because those people are the
*08:39.260- 08:43.660* :  real deal. They're the best of the best. Security around the former president had actually
*08:43.660- 08:48.260* :  been increased, as recent intelligence suggested there was no rainy and plot to assassinate him.
*08:48.660- 08:52.680* :  Conservatives have been attacking his title for being too focused on increasing diversity and
*08:52.680- 08:57.820* :  inclusion within the Secret Service at the expense of effective security. She had pledged to
*08:57.820- 09:03.180* :  increase to 30% the number of female recruits, while right-wing politicians and commentators are
*09:03.180- 09:07.700* :  saying women shouldn't serve in the Secret Service at all and attacking the female agents closest
*09:07.700- 09:11.840* :  to Mr. Trump at the time of the shooting. The BBC North America editor, Sarah Smith.
*09:12.680- 09:18.040* :  Despite ups and downs between the world's two biggest economies, the US and China have
*09:18.040- 09:24.340* :  maintained communications over issues like arms control. However, on Wednesday, China announced
*09:24.340- 09:30.460* :  it is suspending its involvement in nuclear arms control talks in protest at American weapon sales
*09:30.460- 09:36.780* :  to Taiwan. The US said it regretted the Chinese decision. Here's the US State Department spokesman
*09:36.780- 09:42.560* :  Matthew Miller. China has chosen to follow Russia's lead in asserting that engagement on arms control
*09:42.560- 09:47.540* :  can't proceed. When there are other challenges in the bilateral relationship, we think this approach
*09:48.260- 09:55.200* :  undermines strategic stability. It increases the risk of arms race dynamics. We have made efforts to
*09:55.200- 09:59.580* :  bolster the defense of our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, and we will continue to make those
*09:59.580- 10:05.480* :  efforts in the face of Chinese threats to their security. Beijing correspondent Steve McDonald
*10:05.480- 10:11.780* :  told us more about China's announcement. Well, it's all being blamed on, as you say, US weapons
*10:11.780- 10:18.920* :  sales to Taiwan, to the democratically governed Ireland, which Beijing claims its own, but effectively
*10:18.920- 10:24.000* :  operates as an independent entity. You know, they're saying the US is supplying these weapons,
*10:24.000- 10:28.900* :  but I had a look at the actual weapons that they're talking about, and more recently,
*10:28.900- 10:34.680* :  they just seemed to be, I say, just, spare parts for fighter jets, millions of dollars worth,
*10:34.680- 10:40.860* :  but spare parts for fighter jets. And that's been enough for Beijing to say, well, we're pulling out
*10:40.860- 10:48.980* :  of all nuclear non-proliferation talks with the US for the time being. So back to times of high
*10:49.100- 10:54.040* :  tension, it would seem. The Chinese government will remember last time there was a Trump administration.
*10:54.060- 11:01.040* :  It was chaos, really, when it comes to dialogue between these two governments that were slanging
*11:01.040- 11:06.960* :  matches, both sides throwing barbs at one another, whether it be COVID or trade or what have you.
*11:07.820- 11:11.700* :  The Chinese government's sort of already preparing their economy, for not being able to sell
*11:11.700- 11:16.200* :  as much stuff into the US, but the big bonus from Beijing, in terms of their point of view,
*11:16.620- 11:22.920* :  is the chaos that the sort of perceived damage that Donald Trump will do in the West more generally.
*11:22.920- 11:28.340* :  They think a Trump presidency means division in the West, and it makes this country. China
*11:28.820- 11:33.640* :  seem like a sea of stability and more appealing for other countries. So in that sense,
*11:33.640- 11:37.700* :  you know, they might think, well, bring it on. Stephen MacDonald in Beijing.
*11:38.620- 11:42.980* :  Thousands of people across the Caribbean are still struggling to cope with the aftermath of
*11:42.980- 11:47.980* :  Hurricane Barrel, which pummeled the region two weeks ago. One of the worst affected areas was
*11:47.980- 11:53.940* :  the island of Karyaku, just off the coast of mainland Grenada. The UN's climate change executive
*11:53.940- 12:00.040* :  secretary, Simon Steele, is from Grenada, and has returned to Karyaku, where his own family were
*12:00.040- 12:05.780* :  badly affected. He spoke to Rebecca Kesby. Karyaku is my home. That's where my family lived.
*12:06.120- 12:15.360* :  And just seeing the violent devastation of this storm, the twisted, mangled, flattened remains
*12:15.360- 12:24.320* :  of people's homes and vegetation infrastructure is truly heartbreaking. 98% of properties of homes
*12:24.320- 12:30.480* :  infrastructure has either been destroyed or damaged on an island of just 10,000 people.
*12:30.840- 12:36.860* :  I'm just going village to village those that are able to are sheltering in the remains of
*12:36.860- 12:42.660* :  the homes, if not in the remains of family, friends who have taken them in, but there's still
*12:42.660- 12:49.780* :  hundreds of people on island that are currently sheltering in schools, community centres.
*12:50.300- 12:55.320* :  The rains continue to pull in the middle of the rainy season. People without shelter are under
*12:55.320- 13:00.960* :  tarplains. This population is going to be left on their own to figure out how they build back
*13:00.960- 13:07.460* :  better and it cannot happen without the necessary international support and for the process that
*13:07.460- 13:13.960* :  I am part of to work. This was an unprecedented storm. It happened early in the season and there's
*13:13.960- 13:19.260* :  every chance that there could be more hurricanes. This storm happened very quickly, so there wasn't
*13:19.260- 13:24.200* :  much time to prepare either. What kind of things are people able to do in the short term?
*13:24.580- 13:31.460* :  Well, in the immediate aftermath, it's literally going village by village just trying to clear the
*13:31.460- 13:39.900* :  mass of debris. My own aunt took three days to cut through all of the fallen trees debris to get
*13:39.900- 13:45.140* :  to her home before we knew she had survived and there are many stories of that. So the initial
*13:45.140- 13:52.940* :  effort of just cleaning up this apocalyptic scene that in itself is a mammoth task. But that's
*13:52.940- 13:59.320* :  only the first phase. It's how do people, those who don't have insurance and many don't, they simply
*13:59.320- 14:04.260* :  can't afford it. How do they put back their roofs, they'll back their homes, they'll back their
*14:04.260- 14:11.220* :  businesses, their livelihood. We're seeing all around the world, communities struck by disasters,
*14:11.600- 14:15.260* :  hurricanes, cyclones, whether it's floods, whether it's through drought.
*14:16.220- 14:22.500* :  UN climate change executive secretary Simon Steele. Now, here's a story for anyone hoping for
*14:22.500- 14:28.080* :  immortality, or at least a slightly longer life. Scientists in Singapore and the UK have
*14:28.080- 14:33.120* :  discovered a drug that can increase the lifespan of mice by nearly a quarter. The middle-aged
*14:33.120- 14:38.020* :  rodents who were treated in a lab were healthier, stronger, and developed fewer cancers than the
*14:38.020- 14:44.040* :  control group. Here's our medical editor, Fergus Walsh. The quest for an elixir of life has
*14:44.040- 14:49.880* :  obsessed many scientists over the centuries, but usually led to a recipe for snake oil.
*14:50.340- 14:56.680* :  But a team in Singapore and Imperial College London have produced impressive anti-aging results
*14:56.700- 15:03.680* :  albeit in mice. Writing in the journal Nature, they showed that an antibody treatment given to
*15:03.680- 15:09.800* :  middle-aged laboratory mice led to them being less frail, with leaner muscle, and a lower risk
*15:09.800- 15:17.900* :  of cancer. Their lifespan was increased by up to 25%. The older female mice had such glossy
*15:17.900- 15:25.140* :  furry coats and a youthful appearance, they were dubbed supermodel granis by the laboratory staff.
*15:25.980- 15:32.660* :  The treatment targets a protein called interleukin-11, levels of which increase in humans as well
*15:32.660- 15:39.360* :  as mice in older age. Professor Stuart Cook, one of the researchers, explains how the antibody
*15:39.360- 15:47.020* :  works. It turns off the interleukin-11 signal, which hits two or three master aging switches within
*15:47.020- 15:53.480* :  the cell. So when you turn off interleukin-11, you turn off the aging switches and you improve the
*15:53.480- 15:58.600* :  bodily functions in all your organs which are affected by age. The treatment is already being
*15:58.600- 16:05.260* :  trialed for lung disease in humans. It's far too early to say whether the same striking anti-aging
*16:05.260- 16:12.180* :  benefits will result. But the researchers behind the mouse study think further human trials are warranted.
*16:12.520- 16:18.040* :  Fergus Walsh. And still to come on the global news podcast.
*16:18.540- 16:23.800* :  Wouldn't pick for me if it was in dream when I'm child. I'm from Afghanistan. I'm tried my best
*16:23.800- 16:27.600* :  one for everyone and especially for women of Afghanistan and Afghanistan.
*16:28.200- 16:31.640* :  The women cyclists representing Afghanistan at the Olympics.
*16:44.600- 16:51.400* :  We all know what that music means. It's time for the Olympics in Paris. I'm Matt Rodgers,
*16:51.520- 16:57.280* :  and I'm Bowen Yein. And we're doing an Olympics podcast? Uh yeah. We're hosting the two guys
*16:57.280- 17:04.360* :  five rings podcast. Watch every moment of the 2024 Paris Olympics beginning July 26th on NBC
*17:04.360- 17:09.900* :  and Peacock. And for the first time you can stream the 2024 Paris Games on the I Heart Radio app.
*17:10.360- 17:15.340* :  And listen to two guys five rings on the I Heart Radio app Apple podcast or wherever you get your
*17:15.380- 17:15.820* :  podcasts.
*17:21.800- 17:27.420* :  Days after calling student protestors collaborators, the Bangladeshi Prime Minister has tried to
*17:27.420- 17:32.100* :  calm tensions thereby promising justice for six people killed during the demonstrations.
*17:32.220- 17:37.960* :  Sheikh Hasina expressed her condolences and said those responsible would be punished. However,
*17:38.200- 17:42.800* :  students trying to hold a funeral ceremony for their dead colleagues were dispersed by riot
*17:42.800- 17:49.120* :  police throwing stun grenades. One of those killed on Tuesday was Abu Sayed, the youngest of nine
*17:49.120- 17:54.660* :  siblings. He'd been studying English at Begum Roqueer University in Rung Pau. We heard from his
*17:54.660- 18:03.680* :  mother and sister. Sheikh Hasina is responsible for my son's death. I want her to be tried. I want
*18:03.680- 18:13.100* :  her to be punished. So why did they kill him? He was unarmed. He just had a flag of Bangladesh in one
*18:13.100- 18:19.420* :  hand. They got him alone. They could have broken his arms or legs. Why did they kill him? I want
*18:19.420- 18:26.460* :  justice for him. I want the killer to be hanged. During her TV address, the Prime Minister also hinted
*18:26.460- 18:31.680* :  that a forthcoming supreme court ruling would address the demands of protesters to scrap a
*18:31.680- 18:36.560* :  controversial quota scheme. More than 30 million young Bangladesh's are unemployed.
*18:36.560- 18:41.680* :  And the students are angry that many government jobs are reserved for the descendants of veterans
*18:41.680- 18:52.220* :  from the 1971 war of independence. How can the government run these attacks? We've been saying
*18:52.220- 18:56.900* :  since the beginning that we're general students. It's a matter of common sense that over 50% of the
*18:56.900- 19:02.740* :  jobs cannot be given away to quota holders. A normal state cannot be run like this. We are demanding
*19:02.740- 19:08.500* :  the peaceful and respectful solution of quota reformation. The crisis is worsening. We are seeking
*19:08.500- 19:13.460* :  the attention of the government. They should take immediate measures to fix these problems,
*19:13.460- 19:19.320* :  address these issues. They should actually listen to what the students actually want to demonstrate.
*19:20.020- 19:26.020* :  I asked the BBC's Akbar Hussein in DACA what he made of Sheikh Hasina's speech. It looks like
*19:26.020- 19:32.700* :  she tried to calm down the protesters. But it doesn't look like that the government will
*19:32.700- 19:38.960* :  back down or they will accept the quota protesters demand. Even the protesters, they have rejected
*19:38.960- 19:45.000* :  the Prime Minister's speech and they again announced countrywide shutdown on Thursday.
*19:45.600- 19:49.980* :  And they will block all roles and railways. But in the meantime, what the Prime Minister said
*19:49.980- 19:55.080* :  that she urged the student to go back to the classrooms and say that they should have patience
*19:55.080- 20:01.120* :  because the whole thing is pending before the highest court in Bangladesh. And she believes that
*20:01.580- 20:07.600* :  the protesters will get justice in the judicial system. At least six people have died.
*20:08.300- 20:14.120* :  And she promised to have judicial investigation over the death incident. And she said that whoever
*20:14.120- 20:19.700* :  is responsible for that, they will be punished. It's an attempt on the part of the government to
*20:19.700- 20:25.900* :  tame the protesters. But I don't think any major changes of the government policy shift.
*20:26.200- 20:32.340* :  Yeah, particularly as we saw police clamp down on that attempt to hold a funeral for those six
*20:32.340- 20:38.400* :  students. When Prime Minister's she was addressing the nation in television. At the same time,
*20:38.460- 20:46.400* :  hundreds of riot police, they entered the university campuses across the country. And they used
*20:46.400- 20:52.500* :  excessive force, tear shells, rubber bullets to drive them out from university campuses.
*20:53.200- 20:58.480* :  So what the protesters they're saying, they describe it as a double standard on the part of
*20:58.480- 21:05.340* :  government. When the Prime Minister is urging calm, but at the same time, police is using excessive
*21:05.340- 21:09.660* :  force in different university campuses. And what do you make of the divisions we're seeing
*21:09.660- 21:15.260* :  actually on campus with students forcing out those who support the government?
*21:15.600- 21:23.180* :  The student wing of the pro rolling party, they attacked the ordinary students and the ordinary
*21:23.920- 21:28.640* :  students that took to the streets and devout to resist the pro rolling party student wing.
*21:29.440- 21:34.980* :  And in different campuses, ordinary students and Dakota protesters, they actually
*21:34.980- 21:40.760* :  fought the counter attack on the pro rolling party student wing activist and students and
*21:40.760- 21:46.600* :  drove them out of them of the campus. So they said that they hit back because they were beaten
*21:46.600- 21:51.660* :  earlier. Yeah, I mean, given the divisions between these two groups of students as well as
*21:51.900- 21:55.420* :  the protesters distrust of what the Prime Minister's saying, where does it all go from here?
*21:55.600- 22:00.680* :  Very difficult to predict. It looks like the government will not back down. And on the other hand,
*22:00.800- 22:06.940* :  the anti-cota protesters, they say that they will continue their protest until their demands are
*22:06.940- 22:13.320* :  meant. The protesters, they will block roads, railways and highways, everything. So we'll have
*22:13.320- 22:18.220* :  to wait to see how the police will react to that, you know, country-wide shutdown program.
*22:18.800- 22:24.060* :  At Bar Hussein in Dhaka. When the Taliban took control of Afghanistan nearly three years ago,
*22:24.060- 22:29.980* :  women lost many of their rights, including access to sport. Prompted questions about how the
*22:29.980- 22:34.940* :  nation would be represented at the Olympics with calls for Afghanistan to be banned. However,
*22:34.940- 22:39.040* :  a special Afghan gender equal team will be at the Games in Paris.
*22:39.600- 22:44.760* :  There is Rahimi has spoken exclusively to two Afghan women competitors at their training camp
*22:44.760- 22:53.560* :  in Switzerland. In the shadow of the looming Swiss Alps, Yildu's and Fribah Hashimi deep deep
*22:53.560- 22:59.060* :  and pedal even harder to hurl their bikes through the drizzling rain. It is the culmination of both
*22:59.060- 23:05.740* :  a long and difficult personal journey and political wrangles over whether the country would be allowed
*23:05.740- 23:12.980* :  to compete at the Games following the Taliban's takeover. Training at the state of the art
*23:12.980- 23:19.000* :  facility in Switzerland is very different from where they grew up in Faria, a remote and conservative
*23:19.000- 23:25.740* :  province in northern Afghanistan. There, the sisters taught themselves the cycle and had to wear
*23:25.740- 23:32.360* :  disguises when competing in their first races. They dreamed of one day competing at the Olympics
*23:32.360- 23:41.320* :  even as people angry at seeing women riding bicycles through stones of them. In 2021,
*23:41.320- 23:47.000* :  when the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, they placed huge restrictions on women's rights.
*23:48.180- 23:53.580* :  Fearing for the future, the sisters used their contacts in the cycling community to flee the country.
*23:54.420- 23:59.240* :  Faribah told me how much going to Paris 2024 will mean to them in the light of their
*23:59.240- 24:03.880* :  country's recent trouble history. When you go to Olympics, would you be thinking about Afghan
*24:03.880- 24:09.240* :  women? Of course, always I'm thinking about Afghan women. The situation is now it's so different
*24:09.240- 24:14.320* :  in Afghanistan and everything is cool as for the woman. I hope they've been opened everything for
*24:14.320- 24:20.280* :  the woman. In Paris, Yildu's and Fribah will be part of a special gender equal Afghan Olympic
*24:20.540- 24:26.440* :  team, made up of three men and three women. Fazla Ahmad Fazli, the president of the Afghan Cycling
*24:26.440- 24:32.100* :  Federation, who like the sisters now lives in Switzerland, helped to negotiate their place at the
*24:32.100- 24:37.980* :  games. We are the people which never give up and we keep on striving just to make this possible.
*24:38.760- 24:44.540* :  There was many discussions, there was many requests and the day when we heard this confirmation,
*24:44.760- 24:50.460* :  and the joy was just a second to describe how happy I was and how excited I was.
*24:50.940- 24:56.220* :  The decision to send this team ended months of uncertainty of whether the Taliban would be allowed
*24:56.220- 25:01.460* :  to send a male only team to the games. The International Olympic Committee now say no Taliban
*25:01.460- 25:07.540* :  officials will be allowed at the Paris Olympics. For Fribah, taking part in the games will fulfill
*25:07.540- 25:11.620* :  a lifelong ambition. The Olympic for me, it was in dreams when I'm
*25:11.720- 25:17.800* :  come from Afghanistan. I'm tried my best one for everyone and especially for women Afghanistan
*25:17.800- 25:22.900* :  in Afghanistan. Despite the challenges that lie ahead, they are determined to make their presence
*25:22.900- 25:29.260* :  felt at the Olympics in front of the world. For them, this is about far more than just sport.
*25:29.860- 25:31.220* :  Firu's Rahimi reporting
*25:32.380- 25:37.060* :  Researchers have found that a cheap drug prescribed as a blood thinner can be used as a cheap
*25:37.060- 25:42.200* :  antidote for Cobra Venom. The discovery was made by a scientist based in Australia, Canada,
*25:42.200- 25:46.200* :  Costa Rica and the UK, as we heard from our health correspondent Dominic Hughes.
*25:47.060- 25:52.140* :  It's a team of scientists from around the world but led by the University of Sydney and also
*25:52.140- 25:58.420* :  the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. They have been looking at how Venom from snakes
*25:58.440- 26:05.440* :  actually attack cells and tissues and bones and they concentrated on the Venom of spitting
*26:05.440- 26:11.920* :  cobras which cause the most bites in areas of Africa but particularly also in India and they
*26:11.920- 26:18.520* :  worked out the way that the Venom actually gains access to human tissue and they found that
*26:18.820- 26:25.520* :  if they use this drug called heparin that mimics what the Venom would do when it finds itself
*26:25.520- 26:30.100* :  attacking tissue and instead of attacking the tissue it sort of attacks the heparin so it binds
*26:30.100- 26:36.700* :  itself to the heparin and is also neutralised by the heparin if there's enough heparin there.
*26:36.700- 26:43.700* :  Now heparin is this blood thinning drug that is very cheap, really widely available and has been
*26:43.700- 26:48.880* :  used safely for years and years and years so it's got a very strong safety record and the idea is
*26:48.880- 26:54.600* :  you flood the bite site with this drug heparin and it costs a fraction of what traditional
*26:54.600- 27:01.140* :  antivenom antidotes cost and of course antivenom antidotes are really very snake specific they're
*27:01.140- 27:06.000* :  very specific to a particular species of snake a very particular type of snake but heparin seems
*27:06.000- 27:12.900* :  to work for lots and lots of different types of spitting cobra it doesn't work for every snake type
*27:12.920- 27:20.160* :  but it does give the researchers a real insight into how they might develop other sort of antivenoms
*27:20.160- 27:24.760* :  using these existing classes of drugs our health correspondent Dominic Hughes
*27:25.880- 27:30.640* :  on many days since the Hamas massacre in Israel on the 7th of October we have reported
*27:30.640- 27:36.040* :  on the war in Gaza this week Israel has kept up its airstrikes on the Palestinian territory
*27:36.040- 27:41.440* :  with many casualties reported at the same time hopes of progress and ceasefire negotiations
*27:41.440- 27:46.240* :  seem to be fading as Hamas accuses Israel of deliberately undermining the talks
*27:47.080- 27:51.800* :  in this podcast though we thought we'd bring you another story from Gaza fire BBC Arabic
*27:51.800- 27:58.060* :  it's about a family finding ways of making life a bit more bearable even while being displaced by
*27:58.060- 28:03.920* :  the fighting the details from Stephanie's Accreson for many Palestinians agriculture is more than
*28:03.920- 28:10.660* :  just a source of income it's tighter sense of pride and love of the land for Najakuda it's always
*28:10.660- 28:16.380* :  been a way of life coming from a family of farmers in the north of Gaza and when the war forced
*28:16.380- 28:22.620* :  them to flee and seek shelter in Rafa in the south she tried to keep a piece of home with shortages
*28:22.620- 28:28.320* :  on food not just started growing vegetables by the tents they were living in as water supplies
*28:28.320- 28:33.820* :  was scarce she gathered the water she'd used when cooking to wash rice with when she managed to
*28:33.820- 28:38.860* :  grow some vegetables to feed the family other people in the camp noticed her success
*28:40.780- 28:48.900* :  our neighbours began asking for radish leaves to make salads we shared them and tomatoes with
*28:49.200- 28:55.340* :  everyone during Ramadan we were able to enjoy a regular radishes high-priced vegetables that
*28:55.340- 29:02.280* :  many of us displaced just couldn't afford nudges and devours inspired other displaced families to
*29:02.280- 29:07.520* :  start cultivating their own vegetables encouraging them to nurture and care for their small
*29:07.520- 29:14.200* :  makeshift gardens but as the war inched closer to Rafa they were again told they had to move
*29:17.940- 29:23.620* :  as I prepared to leave and dismantle the tents I felt a deep sadness about leaving my garden
*29:24.320- 29:29.180* :  those plants were as dear to me as my own children as I'd cared for them so diligently
*29:29.980- 29:34.840* :  nudger took some corn seeds and wrapped them in nylon to bring them with her as her family for
*29:34.840- 29:40.560* :  a second time had to pack up their belongings and leave when they arrived in al-Mawasi in
*29:40.600- 29:46.160* :  Khan Yunus she hoped she'd be able to plant them but she soon realized that the soil that was
*29:46.160- 29:52.560* :  full of sand with little hope of getting anything to grow but determined to overcome yet another
*29:52.560- 29:58.460* :  challenge nudger got her brother and his family to gather and move clay that she then mixed with
*29:58.860- 30:09.100* :  a project that proved to be a success thankfully our plants have started to bear fruit now I'm
*30:09.100- 30:14.720* :  looking for seeds of other vegetables like cucumbers to grow not just determination to keep our
*30:14.720- 30:21.040* :  family traditions alive even at times of war has created a vibrant green space between the tents
*30:21.040- 30:26.520* :  a symbol of hope and she says that the success is strengthened the family's belief
*30:26.540- 30:33.400* :  that life might one day return to normal Stephanie Zacherson reporting finally the remains
*30:33.400- 30:39.280* :  of the largest stegosaurus ever found have smashed the world record paid for a dinosaur skeleton
*30:39.280- 30:48.120* :  named apex the 150 million year old remains fetched $44.6 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York
*30:48.740- 30:54.040* :  James Reid reports there were gasps and applause in the auction house as the bids for apex rose
*30:54.040- 30:59.520* :  higher and higher the final price was 10 times more than predicted and a third more than the
*30:59.520- 31:06.440* :  previous record for a dinosaur paid for a Tyrannosaurus Rex in 2020 measuring 8 meters long the
*31:06.440- 31:12.200* :  stegosaurus is one of the most complete skeletons ever found it comes with dorsal plates and the
*31:12.200- 31:17.820* :  spiked tail it used to defend itself from predators the fossil was unearthed two years ago in the
*31:17.820- 31:23.920* :  US state of Colorado the identity of the buyer has not yet been made public in recent years super
*31:23.920- 31:30.040* :  rich private collectors of often out big museums to the dismay of scientists James Reid
*31:31.920- 31:36.460* :  and that is all from us for now but the global news podcast will be back very soon this edition
*31:36.460- 31:40.880* :  was mixed by Chris Hanson and produced by Alison Davis our editors Karen Martin I'm all
