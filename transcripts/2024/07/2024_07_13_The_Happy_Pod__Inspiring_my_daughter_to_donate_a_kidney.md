*01:36.720- 01:42.020* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in this edition uploaded on Saturday, the 13th of July, how one
*01:42.020- 01:47.400* :  listeners decision to donate a kidney to a stranger inspired her daughter to do the
*01:47.400- 01:47.680* :  same.
*01:48.280- 01:50.820* :  I just remember thinking, I can do this.
*01:51.360- 01:55.000* :  This gives meaning to life, you know, like I'm helping, I'm contributing.
*01:55.060- 01:59.500* :  No matter which way you do it, it's like this chain of goodness that like spreads
*01:59.520- 02:00.460* :  out into the world.
*02:01.380- 02:03.600* :  The K-pop band breaking barriers.
*02:05.060- 02:13.060* :  The words from a fan that I remember the most were, thank you for coming into the world.
*02:13.680- 02:21.700* :  All three members have hearing impairments, plus it is truly the last wild horse on the
*02:21.700- 02:22.060* :  planet.
*02:22.500- 02:23.300* :  All goes well.
*02:23.320- 02:28.760* :  We could welcome the first baby Sevastia horse is born in the Kazakhstan step after hundreds
*02:28.760- 02:29.260* :  of years.
*02:29.820- 02:34.940* :  The zoo breeding project returning a once endangered species to the wild.
*02:34.940- 02:41.360* :  Also in this podcast, an innovative way of growing crops in arid soil using less water.
*02:42.020- 02:47.600* :  And as the Paris Olympics approach, we hear the amazing story of two athletes who decided
*02:47.600- 02:49.780* :  to share gold in Tokyo.
*02:50.260- 02:51.140* :  We are sportsmen.
*02:51.140- 02:51.780* :  We want to win.
*02:51.940- 02:52.680* :  We don't care.
*02:53.300- 02:57.980* :  But when you are in that moment with somebody that you love, a real friend of you, it's just
*03:05.920- 03:06.080* :  something that you come out from the heart.
*03:06.080- 03:11.160* :  When one happy pod listener donated her kidney to a domino transplant scheme, she never
*03:11.160- 03:13.920* :  imagined the effect would extend to another generation.
*03:14.540- 03:18.820* :  Sophia Good, who's just been competing in the U.S. transplant games for the second time,
*03:18.820- 03:24.540* :  got in touch to tell us how the whole process inspired her daughter, who decided to donate
*03:24.540- 03:27.500* :  her kidney to a stranger earlier this year.
*03:27.800- 03:33.980* :  I spoke to Sophia, who lives in Kamas in Washington state, and her daughter Katie Sibley, who's
*03:33.980- 03:36.020* :  in San Diego in California.
*03:36.780- 03:38.740* :  Katie was 15 and she's 28 right now.
*03:38.760- 03:43.680* :  So was that many years ago and I was a single mom at the time.
*03:44.520- 03:46.180* :  Katie was a difficult teenager.
*03:46.180- 03:47.460* :  I'm driving home from work.
*03:47.460- 03:53.480* :  And I hear a story about a woman who had wanted to give her kidney away to a stranger.
*03:53.740- 03:56.380* :  And I just remember thinking, I can do this.
*03:56.980- 04:00.560* :  This gives meaning to life, you know, like I'm helping, I'm contributing.
*04:01.620- 04:05.100* :  And so I remember coming home talking to Katie about it and I was like, Hey, I heard
*04:05.100- 04:05.480* :  this thing.
*04:05.620- 04:06.680* :  I think I really want to do this.
*04:06.700- 04:10.100* :  And she was like, you can do whatever you want when I'm 18.
*04:10.100- 04:13.740* :  But right now you were the only parent I have because we're dadded fast away, right?
*04:14.320- 04:15.460* :  And you have to wait.
*04:15.460- 04:17.380* :  And I was like, okay, I'll wait.
*04:17.760- 04:19.320* :  But and it was stuck in the back of my brain.
*04:19.320- 04:25.000* :  And then you fast forward to 2014, Katie turned 18 in January.
*04:25.020- 04:30.140* :  So I just celebrated my 10 year kidney donorversory and I, it's like imprinted in my brain.
*04:30.140- 04:35.020* :  The last thing I saw is Katie's bawling, just frying her eyes out as I'm being wheeled
*04:35.020- 04:36.640* :  back into surgery.
*04:37.020- 04:39.820* :  So Katie, tell us more about how you felt about this.
*04:40.500- 04:41.760* :  Oh my God, I was like, no way.
*04:42.000- 04:42.800* :  Are you crazy?
*04:45.360- 04:47.340* :  Like who gives away organs?
*04:47.760- 04:51.240* :  It's like something you, you know, because I didn't even think you could do that.
*04:51.620- 04:53.280* :  You're just like, so don't get it.
*04:53.300- 04:54.260* :  I didn't get it at all.
*04:54.660- 05:00.820* :  So you went ahead with it to Sophia when Katie was 18 and it was an extraordinary gift,
*05:00.820- 05:03.920* :  not just to one person, was it many people benefited?
*05:04.640- 05:04.740* :  Yep.
*05:04.740- 05:09.520* :  So I'm a non-directed donor, which means I didn't have an intended recipient and a lot of times
*05:09.520- 05:10.060* :  what happens.
*05:10.220- 05:15.400* :  Let's pretend that you need a kidney and your loved one wants to give it to you, but
*05:15.440- 05:16.260* :  they're not a match.
*05:16.280- 05:20.700* :  But they say, hey, I'm still willing to give if a kidney comes up for my loved one.
*05:21.160- 05:24.380* :  You throw the extra kidney in there and you start a chain.
*05:24.380- 05:28.340* :  And so it was four people plus my recipient who received a kidney that day.
*05:28.760- 05:29.740* :  Big bang for your buck.
*05:30.280- 05:38.060* :  And later the idea of Katie giving a kidney to that came up later, didn't it?
*05:38.060- 05:42.840* :  And you bought the US transplant games in San Diego, which I have to say.
*05:42.840- 05:44.820* :  I have never heard of until now.
*05:45.220- 05:49.320* :  So the transplant games happen every two years to the United States and then the years
*05:49.320- 05:51.680* :  that they don't happen in the United States, they happen internationally.
*05:51.900- 05:55.380* :  So the ones in San Diego were my first games and Katie lived there.
*05:55.880- 05:59.800* :  And so she came to cheer me on at the different swimming events because that's usually my
*05:59.800- 06:00.920* :  sport of choice and stuff.
*06:01.240- 06:02.520* :  She ran the 5K with me.
*06:03.280- 06:09.580* :  And while we were walking after the 5K, she said, you know, if I was going to be part
*06:09.580- 06:11.880* :  of a community, this is a pretty good one.
*06:12.420- 06:18.420* :  And I remember being so excited and thinking, yeah, so Katie, why did you go ahead with
*06:19.780- 06:19.840* :  it?
*06:19.840- 06:21.240* :  That experience was so cool.
*06:21.580- 06:27.560* :  I don't think you can explain to somebody what being at the transplant games is like
*06:27.560- 06:35.720* :  and how powerful it is because to have living donors and recipients all in one place at
*06:35.720- 06:36.660* :  the same time.
*06:37.260- 06:42.960* :  And the exchange of like stories to one another is like so powerful and so cool.
*06:43.680- 06:49.360* :  And I still just, I really wanted to do it because I could because somebody liked me
*06:49.920- 06:53.700* :  who's like super normal, like super normal, like I work as a bartender.
*06:53.780- 06:59.720* :  I love going to baseball games, but I could totally do this thing that would alter my life,
*06:59.720- 07:05.960* :  somebody else's life and maybe would inspire somebody else to do what I'm doing as well.
*07:06.140- 07:10.760* :  And so it's like no matter which way you do it, it's like this chain of goodness that
*07:10.760- 07:12.400* :  like spreads out into the world.
*07:12.900- 07:16.640* :  And Sophia, you've just been at another transplant games, haven't you?
*07:17.020- 07:18.480* :  Yes, this was my second games.
*07:18.620- 07:21.700* :  And so I am meeting people who have double lung transplant.
*07:21.700- 07:23.120* :  I'm meeting heart recipients.
*07:23.120- 07:26.800* :  I am meeting, this makes me real, it makes me cry every time.
*07:26.800- 07:32.360* :  And I remember them just swimming with so much joy because they could.
*07:32.920- 07:37.880* :  This is the lesson to really, really just approach this life with so much joy.
*07:38.460- 07:42.740* :  Sophia, good and her daughter Katie Sibley, a fantastic story.
*07:43.140- 07:47.860* :  And if you have a story you think will inspire others or makers all smile, do send us an
*07:47.860- 07:52.620* :  email or voice note to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*07:53.760- 07:55.880* :  And now to a band with a difference.
*08:08.820- 08:15.320* :  That's glow by Big Ocean South Korea's first K-pop band composed entirely of singers with
*08:15.320- 08:16.420* :  hearing impairments.
*08:16.780- 08:22.320* :  They recently released their debut album and performed live, incorporating sign language
*08:22.320- 08:26.180* :  in their routines and supported by technology and AI.
*08:26.740- 08:32.060* :  The happy pods, very own Holly Gibbs, spoke to Hyeongjun Kim from the BBC's Korean service
*08:32.060- 08:35.620* :  about the challenges the three band members have faced.
*08:35.940- 08:43.340* :  Big Ocean performs without in-ear monitors, which artists typically use to hear the melody
*08:43.340- 08:45.040* :  and beat clearly.
*08:45.640- 08:51.840* :  And also they told me that they experienced some moments when a cochlear implant fell off
*08:52.500- 08:54.160* :  during a live performance.
*08:54.720- 09:01.160* :  And most of all, because they couldn't hear their own voices, it's very difficult to
*09:01.160- 09:03.460* :  hit the exact pities when they sing.
*09:03.640- 09:07.320* :  And there is some crucial technology that allows them to perform together, isn't there?
*09:07.560- 09:11.120* :  When it comes to dancing, they perceive sound differently.
*09:11.680- 09:16.720* :  So one of the members, Chanyeom, mentioned that each member reacts to bits differently.
*09:16.720- 09:25.800* :  They use large displays showing numbers to indicate bits, and they also use wristwatch.
*09:25.920- 09:30.960* :  The smart watch you see here is vibrational.
*09:30.960- 09:35.520* :  The rhythm of the song is transmitted individually to each of us, making it easier for us to
*09:35.520- 09:37.640* :  perceive the beat, even while dancing.
*09:37.640- 09:41.560* :  Since it's hard for me to hit the exact pitch, I received vocal training.
*09:41.560- 09:43.880* :  There's a device that shows that pitch.
*09:44.420- 09:48.320* :  I sing while looking at the screen, and we also use AI to correct the deficiencies.
*09:50.140- 09:54.080* :  And what sort of reaction have they had from K-pop fans in South Korea and beyond?
*09:54.120- 09:57.240* :  The response has been fantastic so far.
*09:57.860- 10:02.960* :  Before their debut, actually, the members opened her previous remarks.
*10:03.760- 10:07.560* :  Can people with hearing impairment seeing, or can they perform live,
*10:07.560- 10:11.520* :  or do we need to know sign language to attend their meeting, something like that?
*10:11.780- 10:16.020* :  And remember, touching response from one of their fans I interviewed.
*10:16.020- 10:23.060* :  The fan has also has a hearing disability, and she told me that big ocean gave her hope
*10:23.120- 10:25.740* :  and empowered her to pursue her dreams.
*10:26.420- 10:30.400* :  She mentioned watching their performance made me excited,
*10:30.400- 10:33.960* :  because sign language is such an important part of our community.
*10:34.280- 10:36.660* :  And the response has been overwhelmingly positive.
*10:39.480- 10:42.340* :  The words from a fan that I remember the most were,
*10:42.660- 10:44.300* :  thank you for coming into the world.
*10:44.740- 10:47.700* :  I think our fans also know that it's not an easy challenge.
*10:50.760- 10:52.940* :  There have been sounds coming in throughout my life, you know.
*10:52.940- 10:55.240* :  I feel like I have my own view of sound.
*10:55.380- 10:59.280* :  I want to share music from a different dimension that doesn't exist in this world.
*10:59.780- 11:02.860* :  And do you think that they are paving the wave for other K-pop bands
*11:02.960- 11:04.860* :  with similar conditions to them?
*11:05.200- 11:09.160* :  Each year, many idol groups debut, but only a few survive.
*11:09.880- 11:13.180* :  So for idols with disabilities like big ocean,
*11:13.620- 11:16.720* :  the challenges can be even greater.
*11:16.980- 11:21.820* :  But yeah, I think they can be a great model.
*11:30.140- 11:36.280* :  Holly Gibbs speaking to your Jung Kim about big ocean.
*11:37.020- 11:40.480* :  Now with the Olympic and Paralympic games about to start in Paris,
*11:40.520- 11:45.900* :  we've been dipping into the archives to bring you some extraordinary happy stories about those
*11:45.900- 11:50.960* :  taking part. And we're better to start than with an example of her love and friendship
*11:50.960- 11:54.800* :  led to two competing athletes putting their competition aside.
*11:55.500- 11:58.440* :  Gianmarco Tambieri from Italy had been a favourite
*11:58.440- 12:01.460* :  to win a high jump medal in Rio in 2016,
*12:01.460- 12:05.100* :  until seriously injuring his ankle just 20 days before.
*12:05.840- 12:07.940* :  He was told he might never jump again,
*12:07.940- 12:12.980* :  but fought his way back to fitness with the help of friend and fellow high jumper
*12:12.980- 12:15.440* :  Mutaz Esabashem from Qatar.
*12:16.180- 12:19.500* :  So when they were neck and neck of the Olympic final in Tokyo
*12:19.920- 12:24.320* :  and offered the chance to secure their dreams of being the very best in the world,
*12:24.380- 12:27.660* :  they instead chose to share the gold.
*12:28.280- 12:31.320* :  Gianmarco told Ed Harris and Eliza Skinner why?
*12:32.240- 12:36.320* :  We can remember this moment forever in our life, both of us.
*12:36.320- 12:41.000* :  Why one of us must go out from this track with the cry and with the sediments.
*12:41.000- 12:45.540* :  So we deserve both this gold medal because we passed through an terrible injury.
*12:45.540- 12:51.680* :  We did this competition without any any mistake because we both jump to 37 without any mistakes.
*12:51.680- 12:53.180* :  I was lucky enough to be there.
*12:53.660- 12:55.800* :  So the marshal calls you over.
*12:56.020- 12:59.220* :  What's supposed to happen is called a jump off where the bar comes down again.
*12:59.680- 13:03.760* :  It's like a penalty shootout in soccer and the first person who makes a mistake then
*13:04.540- 13:06.000* :  the other guy gets the gold medal.
*13:07.140- 13:09.640* :  Just talk us through exactly what happened.
*13:09.640- 13:11.560* :  The marshal calls you over.
*13:11.560- 13:14.840* :  What does he say and then what do you and Mutaz say?
*13:15.080- 13:21.520* :  He told us something like, okay guys now to jump off and we put the bar over
*13:22.080- 13:25.240* :  or and he didn't say nothing and Mutaz stopped him and he said,
*13:25.640- 13:26.460* :  can we have two gold?
*13:26.920- 13:28.640* :  He answered, yes.
*13:29.300- 13:32.160* :  If you both decide you can have two gold.
*13:32.200- 13:35.660* :  We look at each other like, man, it's me and you, you know?
*13:36.180- 13:36.980* :  And we hug each other.
*13:36.980- 13:42.680* :  We give high five and we hug each other and start crying and being crazy in the track together.
*13:43.400- 13:49.260* :  And yet another attempt left for 239 and if I have to go back in that moment,
*13:49.260- 13:53.060* :  I will decide to do this kind of thing because it's just amazing.
*13:53.140- 13:57.260* :  I mean, me and Mutaz, we were a very big friend before that moment.
*13:57.260- 13:59.520* :  Now we are like blood brothers.
*13:59.820- 14:02.000* :  We speak every single day together a week.
*14:02.000- 14:02.700* :  Share everything.
*14:02.700- 14:04.700* :  We are just really real brothers.
*14:04.820- 14:08.700* :  That moment is more magical than being alone.
*14:09.100- 14:12.300* :  When you win alone, you're like proud of yourself.
*14:12.300- 14:13.820* :  You know that you have done something.
*14:13.820- 14:15.860* :  You know that you are the number one.
*14:16.380- 14:20.860* :  But there is nobody around you that is feeling the same emotion.
*14:20.860- 14:25.560* :  And you can't have this synergy with somebody.
*14:25.560- 14:26.480* :  It's amazing.
*14:26.860- 14:32.300* :  So it sounds like you have this relationship which I think would be very surprising
*14:32.300- 14:38.220* :  to a lot of people who think that athletics all about winning and competition.
*14:38.300- 14:44.300* :  And I think that the same mindset would not be able to understand willingly sharing
*14:44.300- 14:45.920* :  your medal with your friend.
*14:45.920- 14:50.020* :  I mean, I will never say I will share a gold medal.
*14:50.020- 14:50.620* :  I will never.
*14:50.620- 14:51.780* :  I mean, we are sportsmen.
*14:51.780- 14:52.440* :  We want to win.
*14:52.440- 14:54.840* :  We don't care about these things.
*14:55.600- 14:57.880* :  But when you are in that moment and you
*14:58.320- 15:00.520* :  it's just, I don't know how to explain it.
*15:00.580- 15:01.700* :  It's impossible, probably.
*15:01.700- 15:05.560* :  You have to be there with somebody that you love, a real friend of you
*15:05.920- 15:06.980* :  and you look at each other.
*15:07.100- 15:09.800* :  Is that still that moment eyes to eyes?
*15:10.140- 15:12.060* :  It's just something that you come out from the heart.
*15:12.420- 15:15.320* :  What was the reaction like when you went back to Italy?
*15:15.580- 15:19.800* :  Airport was full of people with television with all three and of mine came there.
*15:19.800- 15:24.420* :  There was singing and my family and man, you can't understand.
*15:24.420- 15:28.240* :  And for three months, every single place I was walking in,
*15:28.520- 15:31.120* :  they were clapping to me wherever I went.
*15:31.120- 15:35.580* :  If I walk in the street, the people were, I don't know, the name with the car.
*15:35.580- 15:36.060* :  Baby.
*15:36.720- 15:39.820* :  And the thing that I like more, I mean, it's not the celebrity thing
*15:39.820- 15:42.200* :  because I never care, I really care about it.
*15:42.600- 15:45.700* :  But they stop me and they say me, thank you.
*15:45.880- 15:48.060* :  Thank you because you believed it until the end
*15:48.060- 15:50.220* :  and you give me the chance to believe in my life.
*15:50.220- 15:52.460* :  And I say, wow, it moves something.
*15:52.460- 15:54.220* :  It's in me because I know what it means.
*15:54.220- 15:57.200* :  Because I was searching for somebody to follow in those years.
*15:57.300- 15:59.760* :  And now they follow my story.
*15:59.760- 16:01.300* :  They follow my success.
*16:01.300- 16:02.880* :  And it's just amazing.
*16:02.880- 16:07.080* :  I mean, it makes you proud to have believed until the end.
*16:07.480- 16:11.640* :  And you can hear more from Jan Marco Tambéry and other amazing athletes
*16:11.640- 16:14.740* :  on the podium from the BBC World Service.
*16:15.180- 16:17.020* :  That's wherever you get your podcasts.
*16:21.860- 16:25.080* :  Coming up in this podcast, we meet the children who got to sing
*16:25.400- 16:27.780* :  at London's famous Royal Opera House.
*16:28.560- 16:30.140* :  It's fabulous. I love it.
*16:30.440- 16:34.260* :  I've learnt how to express our feelings through dance and singing.
*16:34.580- 16:36.900* :  It makes me feel free and happy.
*16:45.940- 16:48.340* :  This is the story of how a group of people
*16:48.340- 16:53.500* :  brought music back to Afghanistan by creating their own version
*16:53.860- 16:55.180* :  of American Idol.
*16:56.380- 16:58.000* :  The joy they brought to the nation.
*16:58.500- 16:59.700* :  You're free completely.
*17:00.120- 17:01.720* :  No one is there to destroy you.
*17:02.020- 17:03.660* :  The danger they endured.
*17:04.120- 17:06.340* :  It felt my head should be cut off.
*17:07.140- 17:07.960* :  I'm John Legend.
*17:08.580- 17:11.960* :  Listen to Afghan Star on the I Heart Radio app
*17:12.160- 17:13.820* :  or wherever you get your podcast.
*17:20.160- 17:23.500* :  Growing crops in areas with little rain or poor soil
*17:23.500- 17:25.680* :  is a huge challenge from much of the world.
*17:26.320- 17:27.880* :  But an experiment in the United States
*17:27.880- 17:30.260* :  appears to have found one possible solution
*17:30.720- 17:33.640* :  injecting a special kind of clay into the ground
*17:33.640- 17:36.140* :  to absorb and retain more water.
*17:36.680- 17:39.560* :  Similar trials are also underway in Ecuador and Bolivia.
*17:40.300- 17:42.580* :  Anthony Wallace has been to see the idea in action
*17:42.580- 17:45.320* :  at a date farm in Yuma in Arizona
*17:45.940- 17:47.760* :  near the US-Mexico border.
*17:49.980- 17:52.060* :  The farm is on a mesa
*17:52.720- 17:54.900* :  which is a flat elevated area.
*17:55.620- 17:59.020* :  The ground is very sandy and dry
*17:59.640- 18:02.940* :  but here they make some of the juiciest dates that you can get.
*18:03.520- 18:06.200* :  They do have a delicious day-chake up here as well.
*18:06.560- 18:09.800* :  That's Ule Christian Cybertson, CEO of a company
*18:09.800- 18:11.020* :  called Desert Control.
*18:11.660- 18:13.640* :  So the river bottom down there is very rich
*18:13.640- 18:18.040* :  and fertile soils whereas these are kind of the river banks
*18:18.280- 18:19.560* :  so it's like super sandy.
*18:20.500- 18:23.140* :  They have to pump lots of water up here to irrigate the trees
*18:23.880- 18:25.140* :  but in the midst of the southwest
*18:25.140- 18:27.420* :  worse drought in nearly 500 years
*18:27.980- 18:29.080* :  that isn't very sustainable.
*18:29.720- 18:32.560* :  However Ule and his team have created a liquid that they say
*18:32.560- 18:34.680* :  can turn the desert soil into a sponge
*18:34.680- 18:37.260* :  which holds onto water and nutrients for longer.
*18:37.940- 18:40.200* :  Sandy Desert soil has a lot of gaps in it
*18:40.600- 18:42.440* :  so water drains through it quickly.
*18:42.920- 18:45.460* :  A clay soil is made up of much smaller particles
*18:45.460- 18:48.420* :  that cling together and naturally stop water from escaping.
*18:49.000- 18:51.240* :  So Ule's team mixed tiny particles of clay
*18:51.240- 18:53.840* :  with water and air to create a special fluid.
*18:54.800- 18:56.800* :  He told me when they spray it on the sandy soil
*18:56.800- 18:59.720* :  it soaks in and fills the gap between the sand grains
*19:00.180- 19:01.780* :  and helps it to hang on to any moisture.
*19:02.540- 19:06.080* :  It creates the habitat for the soil microbiology
*19:06.420- 19:08.700* :  to also start to develop and evolve
*19:08.700- 19:12.640* :  so it's kind of a kickstart as well to nature's natural processes.
*19:13.160- 19:16.820* :  I was curious to see exactly how this thin watery substance was made
*19:17.540- 19:19.280* :  so Ule took me to their mobile factory.
*19:20.020- 19:22.220* :  It kind of looks like a white shipping container on wheels
*19:22.840- 19:24.780* :  sitting right on the farm underneath the palms.
*19:25.960- 19:28.500* :  Do you see there was like a huge mixing tank inside the unit?
*19:29.200- 19:31.460* :  They started by collecting soil from the local area
*19:31.780- 19:33.820* :  and then give the clay particles a good shake up.
*19:34.320- 19:37.940* :  And minerals like clay are like a napkin
*19:37.940- 19:40.380* :  that has many layers of thin tin papers, right?
*19:40.840- 19:42.680* :  We're pulling these tissues,
*19:43.540- 19:45.080* :  these tiny papers from each other
*19:45.860- 19:47.600* :  and making them float in the liquid
*19:48.500- 19:51.020* :  so that we get a huge expansion of the surface area.
*19:51.920- 19:55.100* :  There's actually a long-term study underway right now
*19:55.280- 19:57.340* :  that's being run by the University of Arizona.
*19:57.960- 20:00.440* :  The study's been funded by Ule's company
*20:00.440- 20:03.380* :  although the university says there's many safeguards in place
*20:03.380- 20:05.780* :  that keeps them independent and objective.
*20:06.980- 20:09.640* :  We went past rows of citrus trees and some sheds
*20:10.180- 20:12.320* :  to the spot they chose to test the liquid clay.
*20:13.100- 20:14.900* :  So we had to come out here to the junkyard
*20:15.260- 20:17.060* :  to the part of the station I was never farmed
*20:17.760- 20:20.320* :  and we created our trial here on Virgin Land
*20:21.340- 20:23.540* :  where it had very little salt, very little clay.
*20:24.160- 20:26.820* :  This is Robert Bassam who's running the five-year trial.
*20:27.660- 20:29.760* :  They have been growing crops with different mixtures
*20:29.760- 20:31.980* :  of the liquid clay and also some without it.
*20:32.640- 20:34.920* :  The early results suggest the treated soil
*20:35.260- 20:37.280* :  is better at holding nutrients and water
*20:37.520- 20:38.700* :  near the crops root zone.
*20:39.260- 20:42.060* :  And Robert says they've seen a particular success with lettuce.
*20:42.720- 20:44.680* :  In Romain lettuce we've seen an effect
*20:45.560- 20:47.360* :  for two seasons running.
*20:48.280- 20:52.600* :  In the areas that are treated we're seeing larger plants.
*20:53.520- 20:57.580* :  So far the best formulations have seen up to a 50% yield increase.
*20:58.620- 21:03.400* :  So bigger lettuce less water and in Arizona that is a very big deal.
*21:04.420- 21:06.960* :  Any savings that we can have there will really
*21:07.780- 21:10.280* :  help the drought situation that we're in.
*21:11.260- 21:13.340* :  Robert Bassam from the University of Arizona
*21:13.720- 21:15.560* :  ending that report by Anthony Wallace
*21:16.020- 21:19.260* :  and you can hear more about innovative ways to save water
*21:19.620- 21:20.980* :  on people fixing the world.
*21:21.380- 21:22.700* :  Wherever you get your podcasts.
*21:23.840- 21:26.860* :  Now to Kazakhstan where endangered world horses
*21:26.860- 21:28.820* :  have returned to their ancestral lands
*21:28.820- 21:31.680* :  for the first time in at least 200 years.
*21:32.320- 21:34.080* :  In an operation run by Prague Zoo
*21:34.080- 21:37.180* :  seven Prague Valsky horses were airlifted there
*21:37.600- 21:40.720* :  and it aims to continue efforts over the next five years.
*21:41.360- 21:43.580* :  The zoo was appointed to manage the international
*21:43.580- 21:46.300* :  stud book for the species in 1959
*21:46.300- 21:48.240* :  and its efforts have seen the horses
*21:48.240- 21:50.900* :  reintroduced in Mongolia and China.
*21:51.800- 21:54.200* :  Philip Masek, Spokesperson for Prague Zoo,
*21:54.540- 21:55.500* :  told Andrew Peach
*21:55.860- 21:57.860* :  why the operation is so important.
*21:58.580- 22:00.760* :  First of all, we have to realize that it is
*22:01.020- 22:04.480* :  truly the last wild horse on the planet.
*22:05.040- 22:06.720* :  You know, it's not really technically a breed.
*22:06.720- 22:09.800* :  It's a species, you know, but these Valsky horses
*22:10.280- 22:12.780* :  are truly the last wild horses on the planet.
*22:12.780- 22:14.960* :  Sometimes it's better to imagine, for example,
*22:15.320- 22:17.940* :  a zebra because that illustrates more
*22:18.400- 22:20.240* :  the wild nature of this species.
*22:20.640- 22:23.560* :  They are a bit smaller than the domesticated horses.
*22:23.560- 22:25.400* :  He comes right at this horse.
*22:25.820- 22:28.900* :  Also, they have this like sand brown color
*22:29.360- 22:32.040* :  in the summer than in the winter coat.
*22:32.040- 22:33.200* :  They are a bit more dark.
*22:33.640- 22:36.340* :  And you can also always tell it's the Valsky horse
*22:36.340- 22:40.240* :  because it has the white nose and quite dark legs.
*22:40.560- 22:41.400* :  They're certainly beautiful.
*22:41.400- 22:43.720* :  I know this kind of project has already happened
*22:44.240- 22:46.300* :  in other parts of the world in China, for example.
*22:46.300- 22:49.940* :  Why did someone decide that these wild horses
*22:49.940- 22:51.800* :  should be reintroduced to Kazakhstan?
*22:52.340- 22:54.820* :  Well, us in the Prague Zoo, we have been reintroducing
*22:54.820- 22:58.560* :  these horses to Mongolia since 2011 till 2019.
*22:58.580- 23:01.180* :  And we created a healthy population there.
*23:01.180- 23:04.020* :  We transported around 35 horses there.
*23:04.460- 23:06.880* :  But today, there is around 800 of them.
*23:06.920- 23:08.240* :  They are breeding really well.
*23:08.820- 23:10.840* :  And they are great grandchildren of the horses.
*23:10.840- 23:12.960* :  We transported there 13 years ago.
*23:13.300- 23:15.120* :  So this project was very successful.
*23:15.120- 23:17.900* :  So we were contacted by the government of Kazakhstan
*23:18.480- 23:20.380* :  to basically create the same project.
*23:20.380- 23:23.860* :  To return this wild horse to its historical habitat
*23:23.860- 23:26.680* :  because the Valsky horse actually used to live
*23:26.920- 23:30.760* :  in the whole vast area of central Asian steps and deserts.
*23:30.880- 23:35.080* :  What I love about this is the fact that the horses were kept in your zoo
*23:35.600- 23:39.060* :  and other zoos around Europe is the only reason
*23:39.060- 23:42.000* :  they can now be introduced to their natural habitats.
*23:42.720- 23:42.900* :  Absolutely.
*23:42.900- 23:45.720* :  Well, for us, it's the main purpose
*23:46.360- 23:48.840* :  of today's modern zoological gardens.
*23:49.020- 23:50.640* :  It is really the best you can do
*23:50.640- 23:53.740* :  is to have population of some endangered animal
*23:53.740- 23:55.660* :  in human care or in captivity
*23:56.320- 23:59.380* :  and then reintroduce it to its original land.
*23:59.400- 24:01.540* :  That is really the best what the zoo can do.
*24:01.740- 24:05.900* :  But these actual animals are used to living in a zoo.
*24:05.900- 24:09.780* :  So if you put them in their natural environment in Kazakhstan,
*24:10.540- 24:12.060* :  how do they acclimatize to that?
*24:12.320- 24:15.680* :  Well, we have to select the horses for the transport very carefully.
*24:15.680- 24:16.520* :  They have to be young.
*24:16.520- 24:19.000* :  They have to have good personalities actually,
*24:19.000- 24:20.460* :  because every horse is different.
*24:20.460- 24:21.780* :  It's a very intelligent animal.
*24:22.040- 24:23.480* :  So we selected some horses in Germany.
*24:23.480- 24:25.060* :  Some of them came from Czech Republic.
*24:25.300- 24:26.340* :  One of them came from France
*24:26.380- 24:29.160* :  and we sort of put them together in Berlin
*24:29.160- 24:30.640* :  and also here in the Czech Republic
*24:30.960- 24:32.200* :  and about the acclimatization.
*24:32.200- 24:35.000* :  Well, they are spending eight to 12 months
*24:35.000- 24:37.780* :  in this huge acclimatization pan there
*24:37.780- 24:40.120* :  because we have to check if they're going to survive the winter.
*24:40.420- 24:42.940* :  All these factors have to be really
*24:43.220- 24:45.240* :  and very carefully sought through
*24:45.620- 24:48.720* :  and then we can release them to the wild, wild nature.
*24:48.940- 24:49.980* :  It's very early days.
*24:50.280- 24:51.380* :  How are they doing so far?
*24:52.360- 24:53.800* :  I was there when they were released.
*24:53.940- 24:56.380* :  It was an incredible moment really.
*24:56.380- 24:58.760* :  There were people crying, not just the Kazakhs
*24:58.760- 25:00.440* :  but even us Czechs
*25:00.520- 25:02.220* :  and even the Germans were crying
*25:03.480- 25:06.880* :  when the horses were running while it was incredible.
*25:06.880- 25:08.140* :  And they're doing really well
*25:08.460- 25:11.760* :  and we already saw that the stallion named Zoro
*25:12.000- 25:13.480* :  he made it two of the mares.
*25:13.700- 25:16.020* :  So if all goes well in 11 months
*25:16.020- 25:19.400* :  we could welcome the first baby Sevastky horse
*25:19.400- 25:22.220* :  born in the Kazakh step after hundreds of years.
*25:22.940- 25:25.560* :  Oh, that was a Philip Masek of Prague Zoo.
*25:26.680- 25:29.120* :  It's a chance most singers can only dream of
*25:29.380- 25:31.600* :  performing it one of the world's most famous venues.
*25:32.320- 25:33.860* :  Schoolchildren around the UK
*25:33.860- 25:36.900* :  have been taking to the stage at the Royal Opera House in London
*25:37.320- 25:40.040* :  to learn and perform a song and a dance.
*25:40.880- 25:42.220* :  The happy pods and a Murphy
*25:42.580- 25:43.720* :  went along to find out more.
*25:44.480- 25:46.660* :  I'm here in one of the many rehearsal theatres
*25:46.740- 25:48.120* :  inside the Royal Opera House
*25:48.440- 25:50.540* :  watching a class of children learn a dance routine
*25:51.140- 25:54.360* :  and on my left there's a large screen with lots of tiny squares
*25:55.120- 25:57.440* :  each with a classroom or even a school hall
*25:57.820- 26:00.520* :  full of students following along from up and down the country.
*26:01.020- 26:02.420* :  They've been loving it.
*26:02.500- 26:04.280* :  They've just been really going through it today.
*26:05.220- 26:05.860* :  That's Abigail.
*26:06.280- 26:07.720* :  One of the singing coaches here today.
*26:12.200- 26:14.300* :  Children across the country have been
*26:14.780- 26:17.000* :  learning a fantastic song called The Hope.
*26:17.400- 26:19.480* :  It's by a composer called Ayanna with a Johnson
*26:19.700- 26:21.480* :  and it's just really, really beautiful.
*26:21.480- 26:23.320* :  It's one of those tunes where you're just like
*26:23.360- 26:26.140* :  having them sing this song all the day long.
*26:29.660- 26:32.000* :  It's about this puppet.
*26:32.000- 26:33.920* :  This character called Amal
*26:34.420- 26:39.220* :  who is a refugee who's travelled across the continent.
*26:39.320- 26:42.800* :  So the song is just welcoming her into this space.
*26:44.280- 26:48.320* :  It's just really exciting to see children be creative,
*26:48.960- 26:50.680* :  have them use their voices as well
*26:50.680- 26:52.500* :  because children's voices are so special.
*26:53.120- 26:54.860* :  As well as learning the steps and the lyrics,
*26:54.920- 26:58.020* :  there's an obvious focus on teaching the children about their rights
*26:58.020- 27:00.380* :  to an education, to express themselves,
*27:00.860- 27:02.140* :  and to have their voices heard.
*27:02.980- 27:05.320* :  Isabelle from UNICEF had some advice for the children
*27:05.420- 27:06.460* :  before their performance.
*27:07.100- 27:09.380* :  I think that whilst you're all performing,
*27:09.380- 27:12.280* :  just to be really enjoying your rights
*27:12.280- 27:15.060* :  because what you're doing is that you're enjoying your right
*27:15.060- 27:17.800* :  to expression, you're enjoying your right to a voice,
*27:17.800- 27:21.000* :  you're right to play and take part in cultural activities.
*27:21.800- 27:24.080* :  But at the same time, what you're also doing
*27:24.080- 27:26.260* :  is telling loads and loads of other people
*27:26.260- 27:27.700* :  all about children's rights
*27:27.700- 27:30.880* :  and so many children are not getting the rights
*27:30.880- 27:31.840* :  that they should have.
*27:32.180- 27:33.340* :  And just before their big moment,
*27:33.340- 27:35.080* :  I caught up with a few of them backstage.
*27:35.880- 27:39.660* :  I was really nervous, but now I just feel excited.
*27:40.240- 27:41.800* :  It's fabulous. I love it.
*27:42.060- 27:45.880* :  I've learnt how to express our feelings through dance and singing.
*27:46.040- 27:47.980* :  The best bit is actually the singing.
*27:47.980- 27:50.580* :  It makes me feel free and happy.
*27:51.000- 27:52.920* :  My favourite bit is singing the songs
*27:53.620- 27:57.020* :  because I can't express myself to the world.
*27:57.700- 28:00.600* :  We're all really excited to show off what we've learned
*28:00.600- 28:03.520* :  over the couple of lessons and days we've had to practice.
*28:04.440- 28:06.200* :  I'm excited and really nervous.
*28:07.060- 28:08.400* :  I'm excited, I'm nervous, I'm drawn.
*28:08.960- 28:10.840* :  Despite the nerves, the show was a success.
*28:11.480- 28:13.360* :  The children sang and danced in harmony,
*28:13.880- 28:14.320* :  well mostly,
*28:15.000- 28:17.320* :  and certainly made the most of their rights to be heard.
*28:29.100- 28:30.540* :  Anamorphy reporting there,
*28:30.540- 28:33.420* :  and I'm sure we heard some stars of the future.
*28:34.420- 28:35.920* :  And that's it from the happy pod for now.
*28:35.920- 28:37.300* :  We'd love to hear from you
*28:37.300- 28:38.960* :  if you have any stories to share
*28:39.280- 28:40.440* :  that will make us all smile.
