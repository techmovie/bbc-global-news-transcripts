*00:54.020- 00:56.760* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices

*01:19.260- 01:21.100* :  This is the Global News Podcast
*01:21.700- 01:23.280* :  from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.620- 01:29.560* :  I'm Nigel Adely, and in the early hours of Thursday,
*01:29.560- 01:32.920* :  the 25th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:33.740- 01:36.740* :  Benjamin Netanyahu was told a joint session of Congress
*01:37.380- 01:40.080* :  that Israel will retain security control of Gaza
*01:40.080- 01:42.660* :  for the immediate future, but the territory
*01:42.660- 01:45.720* :  should have a civilian Palestinian administration.
*01:46.660- 01:49.100* :  The Israeli Prime Minister speech was boycotted
*01:49.100- 01:52.380* :  by many Democrats, while thousands of demonstrators
*01:52.520- 01:54.080* :  protested outside Congress.
*01:55.000- 01:58.140* :  At least 25 people have died and dozens are missing
*01:58.880- 02:00.260* :  after a boat carrying migrants
*02:00.800- 02:02.480* :  psych off the coast of Mauritania.
*02:05.660- 02:06.660* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:07.220- 02:12.180* :  The whip can be a tool to extend the information you want
*02:12.220- 02:15.540* :  to give to the horse, but it has to be in a very mild way.
*02:16.000- 02:19.080* :  But if it's used as punishment or in a violent way,
*02:19.080- 02:21.940* :  stressing the horse, it's absolutely unacceptable.
*02:22.360- 02:24.740* :  A video emerges of the British equestrian
*02:24.740- 02:27.240* :  Charlotte Shudardan whipping her horse.
*02:27.820- 02:29.360* :  She has withdrawn from the Olympics,
*02:29.920- 02:31.720* :  calling it an error of judgment.
*02:36.720- 02:38.560* :  Our enemies are your enemies.
*02:38.580- 02:42.420* :  That was the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's message
*02:42.940- 02:45.640* :  to U.S. lawmakers in his address to a joint session
*02:45.640- 02:47.380* :  of Congress on Wednesday.
*02:48.140- 02:50.360* :  It was a controversial visit to Washington
*02:50.960- 02:54.160* :  as the war in Gaza continues after nine months of fighting.
*02:54.960- 02:57.180* :  After praising Israel's alliance with America,
*02:57.820- 03:00.460* :  Mr. Netanyahu said that once a mass was defeated,
*03:01.160- 03:04.240* :  the Palestinian territory must be demilitarized
*03:04.600- 03:05.700* :  and de-radicalized.
*03:05.860- 03:07.720* :  Israel does not seek to resettle Gaza.
*03:08.460- 03:09.780* :  But for the foreseeable future,
*03:10.360- 03:13.460* :  we must retain overriding security control
*03:13.460- 03:15.600* :  there to prevent the resurgence of terror
*03:15.900- 03:19.080* :  to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.
*03:21.260- 03:24.720* :  Thousands of demonstrators protested outside the capital building,
*03:25.200- 03:27.500* :  demanding an immediate cease-fire in Gaza
*03:28.020- 03:30.360* :  as well as calling for Mr. Netanyahu's arrest.
*03:31.100- 03:32.700* :  Some of them clashed with riot police.
*03:38.520- 03:41.440* :  Inside the capital, Mr. Netanyahu's speech received
*03:41.440- 03:45.640* :  standing ovation, mostly from the Republican side of the chamber.
*03:46.220- 03:48.340* :  Several Democrats boycotted his address.
*03:48.960- 03:50.960* :  Others made their presence quite clear,
*03:51.600- 03:52.480* :  where she did to live,
*03:52.480- 03:55.400* :  the first Palestinian-American member of Congress
*03:56.020- 03:57.820* :  was seen holding a placard in the air.
*03:58.320- 04:00.820* :  On one side it read, guilty of genocide,
*04:01.480- 04:03.540* :  war criminal was written on the other.
*04:04.300- 04:07.560* :  So what does this all mean for US-Israel relations?
*04:08.320- 04:11.980* :  I spoke to the BBC's international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
*04:12.680- 04:16.860* :  Netanyahu was trying from the outset to say that Israel
*04:17.280- 04:18.920* :  is a vital ally of America,
*04:19.840- 04:23.520* :  that in fact it's fighting America's wars for it,
*04:23.880- 04:25.320* :  it's protecting America.
*04:26.040- 04:30.580* :  So I think what he wanted to do was to try to say to all sides of politics in the US,
*04:31.500- 04:34.080* :  you need to support not just my country,
*04:34.180- 04:35.940* :  but you need to support me.
*04:36.600- 04:41.160* :  There was a letter this week from senior members of Israeli intelligence,
*04:41.160- 04:42.920* :  former members of Israeli intelligence,
*04:42.980- 04:47.100* :  to members of Congress saying just how much of a threat Netanyahu
*04:47.800- 04:48.260* :  to Israel.
*04:48.480- 04:52.480* :  Will that have any impact on what he said today and the reaction to it?
*04:53.200- 04:55.100* :  Well, I mean, it was an extraordinary letter.
*04:55.100- 04:57.320* :  This was a, you know, it was a star-studded list.
*04:57.320- 05:00.960* :  It was included the former head of Mossad, the spy agency.
*05:00.960- 05:03.540* :  There was a former army chief of staff,
*05:03.540- 05:05.580* :  a former deputy army chief of staff,
*05:06.120- 05:07.020* :  several ambassadors.
*05:07.020- 05:08.740* :  There was a Nobel Prize winner,
*05:09.440- 05:11.740* :  and they said in this letter to congressional leaders
*05:12.580- 05:16.220* :  that Netanyahu is, quote, an existential threat.
*05:17.160- 05:20.700* :  To the state of Israel that essentially he wants to drag
*05:21.600- 05:27.160* :  Israel and the US into a perpetual war against a mass,
*05:27.160- 05:31.120* :  against his ballerine Lebanon and ultimately perhaps against Iran
*05:31.940- 05:38.160* :  because they very much go with the view that Netanyahu is prolonging the war
*05:38.740- 05:42.280* :  for his own political reasons, not least as they pointed out
*05:43.060- 05:46.160* :  to avoid a reckoning of how it was.
*05:46.160- 05:48.980* :  He built up a mass, of course, he didn't go into this in his speech.
*05:49.660- 05:52.080* :  He wanted to divide and rule the Palestinians.
*05:52.080- 05:54.400* :  And as they point out in that letter,
*05:55.680- 06:00.000* :  so he wouldn't ever have to make a political settlement with the Palestinians.
*06:00.000- 06:03.960* :  He did the best he could to divide the two sides of it.
*06:03.960- 06:07.120* :  Hamas in Gaza, Fata in the West Bank.
*06:07.600- 06:10.560* :  So to do that, he built up Hamas.
*06:11.240- 06:14.860* :  He allowed the cataries to bring in packing cases,
*06:15.420- 06:17.080* :  full of cash into Gaza,
*06:17.460- 06:19.320* :  essentially to try and keep Gaza quiet.
*06:19.940- 06:24.600* :  And of course, subsequently, I mean, who knows how they spent that money.
*06:25.280- 06:28.260* :  Where does this speech and where does what's happened this week
*06:28.260- 06:29.960* :  leave him on the global stage to feel?
*06:30.560- 06:32.720* :  Well, he's Israel's longest serving Prime Minister.
*06:33.100- 06:34.680* :  People have heard a lot of this stuff before.
*06:35.220- 06:38.220* :  Of course, the timing is everything and the timing comes
*06:39.080- 06:41.500* :  in an American election campaign.
*06:41.500- 06:43.900* :  And he didn't try to intervene in that.
*06:44.420- 06:46.760* :  He paid tribute to Biden and to Trump.
*06:46.800- 06:50.020* :  I felt a bit more for Trump than for Biden.
*06:51.360- 06:55.920* :  What he did do, I think, was to double down on all the messages
*06:56.640- 07:00.120* :  that he's come out with over nine months of war,
*07:00.120- 07:04.000* :  which is ignore everything you hear about starvation in Gaza.
*07:04.820- 07:07.060* :  And whatever happens in four months time,
*07:07.060- 07:09.560* :  there will be a new U.S. president.
*07:09.620- 07:12.400* :  How could that have an impact on what's going to happen?
*07:13.060- 07:16.080* :  Well, if it's Trump, when Trump was in power,
*07:16.220- 07:19.200* :  he was a great supporter of Netanyahu,
*07:19.580- 07:21.260* :  and actually rather angry,
*07:21.740- 07:25.060* :  when Netanyahu welcomed Biden when Biden won the election,
*07:25.120- 07:27.760* :  which of course, Trump wrongly said was stolen.
*07:28.640- 07:32.360* :  If it's Kamala Harris, now it's going to be a bit different.
*07:33.040- 07:36.220* :  Though, while I think that the kernel
*07:36.220- 07:40.680* :  of the America's Alliance with Israel is not going to change,
*07:41.520- 07:44.700* :  she does come from a more progressive place than Biden did.
*07:45.680- 07:49.300* :  She called early on for a ceasefire, for example, in Gaza.
*07:49.800- 07:52.260* :  So that will be a little bit harder for him to navigate.
*07:52.260- 07:55.860* :  But you know, Netanyahu is a master at playing for time,
*07:55.860- 07:58.320* :  and he's a master at telling people,
*07:59.300- 08:01.300* :  at least people on his side, what they want to hear.
*08:02.080- 08:07.360* :  Jeremy Boeing. As we heard there, Benjamin Netanyahu faced empty seats in the chamber,
*08:08.000- 08:09.680* :  as well as long protests outside.
*08:10.440- 08:13.180* :  One of those who stayed away is Delia Ramirez,
*08:13.180- 08:16.160* :  a Democratic Congresswoman for Illinois.
*08:16.880- 08:20.000* :  She's one of nine progressive members of the House of Representatives,
*08:20.640- 08:24.560* :  known as the squad. Just why did she boycott the speech?
*08:25.280- 08:28.440* :  Vivina and Yahoo should never have come to a joint session of Congress.
*08:29.120- 08:32.060* :  Over 30 members of Congress didn't attend.
*08:32.060- 08:33.720* :  I would say probably close to the 50,
*08:34.200- 08:36.940* :  a good chunk of us just left alternative programming here.
*08:37.580- 08:42.740* :  There were Jewish, Christian, Muslim members who've been here for 25, 30 years,
*08:42.740- 08:44.860* :  like Congressman Leader Clyburn,
*08:44.860- 08:50.500* :  and Congresswoman Jan Shakowski in a room with an Israeli and a Palestinian,
*08:50.500- 08:53.680* :  both who lost family since October 7th,
*08:54.080- 08:56.040* :  calling for a pathway to peace.
*08:56.600- 09:02.940* :  Vivina and Yahoo went to our joint session to continue to spew the same language
*09:02.940- 09:05.100* :  he has continued to use and hypocrisy.
*09:05.760- 09:08.440* :  We've been saying yes to him for nine months,
*09:09.280- 09:12.160* :  yes to more money, yes to transfer of arms,
*09:12.720- 09:16.820* :  yes to bombs, and yet the hostages are not home.
*09:17.500- 09:19.200* :  We are closer to a regional war,
*09:19.860- 09:22.060* :  and almost 40,000 Palestinians have died.
*09:22.520- 09:24.300* :  A war crime must be an invader joint session.
*09:24.620- 09:25.860* :  Frankly, I think you should be in prison.
*09:26.640- 09:31.360* :  Mr. Nadiyahu said that anti-Israeli protesters were aligning themselves
*09:32.200- 09:35.580* :  with Hamas and what they did on October 7th.
*09:35.580- 09:39.600* :  He also described them as Iran's useful idiots.
*09:41.020- 09:46.680* :  Look, I would never, ever support folks that are talking about supporting Hamas
*09:46.940- 09:48.800* :  or supporting war or support the killing.
*09:49.500- 09:52.340* :  I think that it's really easy to put people in a blanket
*09:53.140- 09:55.520* :  of their one side or the other side,
*09:55.520- 09:57.940* :  their pro-Hamas or their anti-Israel.
*09:58.280- 10:01.280* :  I think that what you've seen throughout and what I have seen all day
*10:01.860- 10:03.600* :  are people that are calling for peace.
*10:04.360- 10:05.680* :  People that are calling for diplomacy.
*10:06.580- 10:09.000* :  But look, if you call for peace in this place,
*10:09.000- 10:10.040* :  if you call for diplomacy,
*10:10.040- 10:12.640* :  if you call to choose life over death,
*10:13.020- 10:14.300* :  you're called anti-Semitic.
*10:14.800- 10:18.040* :  But I just sat with a group filled of Jewish leaders
*10:18.040- 10:21.680* :  who are calling for peace and who said very loud and clear today.
*10:22.240- 10:25.400* :  Look, there is no safety and security for those Israeli people
*10:25.820- 10:28.320* :  if we don't have safety and security for the Palestinian people.
*10:29.440- 10:32.180* :  Delia Ramirez speaking to Julian Marshall.
*10:33.100- 10:36.440* :  As we recall this podcast, dozens of people are missing
*10:36.980- 10:39.720* :  after a boat capsized off the coast of Mauritania.
*10:40.360- 10:42.040* :  At least 25 people have died.
*10:42.520- 10:44.180* :  Around 100 were rescued.
*10:44.960- 10:48.160* :  According to the international organization for migration,
*10:48.760- 10:51.300* :  there were around 300 passengers on board.
*10:52.100- 10:54.100* :  It's been reported that a group of migrants
*10:54.100- 10:58.480* :  thought to be from the West African countries of Senegal and Gambia
*10:58.860- 11:02.040* :  were trying to reach Europe after setting off seven days ago.
*11:02.700- 11:06.220* :  I heard more from our Africa Regional Editor, Richard K. Goy.
*11:07.140- 11:09.980* :  This is the second such incident to take place this month
*11:10.460- 11:11.940* :  of the cost of Mauritania.
*11:12.040- 11:14.680* :  So you would be having a lot of African migrants
*11:14.680- 11:16.440* :  from different parts of the continent,
*11:16.440- 11:18.660* :  mostly from West Africa and North Africa,
*11:19.380- 11:22.000* :  who are keen or trying to make their way to Europe.
*11:22.000- 11:24.620* :  So these are economic migrants, people who are looking for
*11:24.920- 11:26.440* :  opportunities to better their lives.
*11:26.440- 11:29.520* :  And so the West African Atlantic route,
*11:29.520- 11:31.960* :  which normally goes through the Canary Islands,
*11:32.500- 11:34.660* :  seems to have become a very popular route.
*11:34.660- 11:36.860* :  And in the process, people are traveling
*11:36.860- 11:38.600* :  in some of these makeshift boats
*11:38.600- 11:41.260* :  and some of them really are not in very good standards.
*11:41.260- 11:43.140* :  You know, smugglers involved in the business
*11:43.140- 11:45.260* :  and so they cram people and so they overload
*11:45.260- 11:49.760* :  and in the cost of time, lots of them have ended up tragically.
*11:49.960- 11:52.000* :  The European Union has provided Mauritania
*11:52.000- 11:54.920* :  with more than $200 million in assistance
*11:54.920- 11:57.980* :  to try and help combat irregular migration.
*11:58.060- 12:01.260* :  But seemingly, at the moment, it's a losing battle.
*12:01.520- 12:04.380* :  It seems so because even the Mauritiano authorities
*12:04.380- 12:08.520* :  seems to be overwhelmed by the wave of migrants
*12:09.120- 12:11.480* :  who have been very keen to use their territory
*12:11.480- 12:14.960* :  to target a Spanish territory in terms of transit.
*12:15.540- 12:19.040* :  And so it's difficult to police, especially the cost there
*12:19.780- 12:22.140* :  because of capacity issues and resources.
*12:22.140- 12:24.100* :  It's sort of like a losing battle
*12:24.100- 12:26.400* :  because you've been seeing a surge in numbers
*12:26.480- 12:27.940* :  or people trying to make their way
*12:28.400- 12:29.840* :  to Europe or through the Canaries.
*12:30.240- 12:33.180* :  So as a result of this, do we see people traffickers
*12:33.180- 12:36.340* :  and similar people coming into the area
*12:36.340- 12:38.320* :  and really flooding the area at the same time?
*12:38.520- 12:40.480* :  Actually, that's a reflective of the situation
*12:40.580- 12:42.680* :  because it's a whole syndicate
*12:42.740- 12:44.780* :  of people who are involved in the business
*12:44.900- 12:47.460* :  and it's not just that the people traffickers themselves,
*12:47.460- 12:50.620* :  it's not just the smugglers themselves, it's an entire ring.
*12:51.080- 12:53.400* :  And there have been questions really good officials
*12:53.400- 12:55.840* :  or perhaps people within Mauritania and territory
*12:55.840- 12:57.320* :  who would be looking the other way
*12:57.320- 13:00.160* :  because they seem to have been benefiting from the business.
*13:00.200- 13:02.380* :  And that's really been a major point of concern
*13:02.820- 13:05.060* :  just looking at the trends in the last couple of months.
*13:05.940- 13:06.740* :  Richard K. Goy.
*13:07.580- 13:09.440* :  Two incredibly rare fossils
*13:09.440- 13:12.900* :  found on the isle of sky of the western Scottish coast
*13:13.420- 13:16.020* :  are rewriting our understanding of the earliest mammals
*13:16.020- 13:17.100* :  to walk the earth.
*13:17.660- 13:21.120* :  Call Crestadian, they are the remains of shrew-like mammals
*13:21.660- 13:23.440* :  which date back to the time with the dinosaurs
*13:24.320- 13:25.720* :  and scientists have discovered
*13:26.280- 13:28.180* :  that they had a very different life history
*13:28.600- 13:29.720* :  from their modern relatives.
*13:30.460- 13:33.580* :  Dr. Elsa Panciaroli is a paleontologist
*13:33.580- 13:35.420* :  at the National Museum Scotland
*13:35.960- 13:36.760* :  and the lead researcher.
*13:37.540- 13:40.900* :  So Crosatodon sits really early in the tree of mammals
*13:41.320- 13:44.080* :  and it would have looked superficially very much like
*13:44.120- 13:45.640* :  a little mouser or shrewd
*13:46.260- 13:47.920* :  and it would have had fur on the outside
*13:47.920- 13:49.440* :  and probably whiskers as well.
*13:50.020- 13:53.180* :  But internally in terms of its bones and its physiology
*13:53.240- 13:55.160* :  it would have been a little bit different
*13:55.200- 13:57.100* :  because this is before true mammals
*13:57.100- 13:58.680* :  it's a much earlier form.
*13:59.140- 14:01.300* :  Morphima Science reporter Helen Briggs.
*14:02.140- 14:04.380* :  Now 166 million years ago
*14:04.520- 14:07.220* :  this tiny furry shrew-like mammal
*14:07.220- 14:10.460* :  was scampering under the feet of dinosaurs
*14:10.460- 14:12.220* :  in a very different world
*14:12.740- 14:15.680* :  and Scotland's Isle of Sky was very different then
*14:15.680- 14:17.040* :  it was subtropical,
*14:17.740- 14:20.380* :  pine trees, warm water legumes
*14:20.960- 14:23.360* :  and then two of these little creatures ended up
*14:23.620- 14:25.400* :  dying and trapped in rock.
*14:25.400- 14:28.160* :  166 million years later
*14:28.560- 14:30.560* :  scientists are looking at them
*14:31.060- 14:32.500* :  under high-tech scanners
*14:32.940- 14:34.340* :  and if we can understand them
*14:34.680- 14:36.940* :  then we can understand all the pathway
*14:37.520- 14:39.740* :  to the mammals that rule the planet today
*14:39.740- 14:41.000* :  and how different they are
*14:41.000- 14:43.380* :  because as the researcher points out on the outside
*14:43.380- 14:45.760* :  they look like little furry shrews
*14:45.760- 14:46.800* :  that are running around today
*14:46.800- 14:48.700* :  but on the inside they're quite different.
*14:49.200- 14:50.280* :  I struggled to pronounce it.
*14:50.280- 14:51.840* :  Chris Hattodon I think is a better way
*14:51.840- 14:53.160* :  for me to say it at the moment.
*14:53.640- 14:55.140* :  Just tell us a bit more about
*14:55.580- 14:56.820* :  what they look like it
*14:56.860- 14:59.440* :  and that chain towards the dinosaurs and towards us.
*15:00.260- 15:01.700* :  They were about the size of
*15:02.080- 15:03.220* :  shrews and mammals today
*15:03.620- 15:05.200* :  but what was very different about them was
*15:05.440- 15:07.920* :  that they grew much more slowly
*15:08.240- 15:09.220* :  and they lived longer.
*15:09.480- 15:11.320* :  Today's little mammals like shrews
*15:11.320- 15:12.120* :  will live for a year.
*15:12.120- 15:13.860* :  They have their baby teeth
*15:13.860- 15:14.840* :  only for a couple of weeks
*15:14.920- 15:16.520* :  and then they're weaned
*15:16.520- 15:19.420* :  whereas these ones were living to at least seven
*15:19.840- 15:21.440* :  and the baby kept its teeth
*15:21.540- 15:22.680* :  until about two.
*15:22.960- 15:25.020* :  How were these fossils found on the other sky?
*15:25.780- 15:26.540* :  The other sky
*15:26.540- 15:30.060* :  is really very well known for its Jurassic fossils
*15:30.640- 15:32.800* :  so scientists go there every year
*15:32.800- 15:35.960* :  they find things like dinosaur prints in the rock
*15:35.960- 15:38.540* :  and these little fossils were buried
*15:39.040- 15:41.080* :  even the scientists themselves found them
*15:41.080- 15:42.680* :  very very hard to detect
*15:42.820- 15:43.660* :  and that they just thought
*15:43.660- 15:45.300* :  well this is just a little bit of rock
*15:45.740- 15:47.940* :  but then because we have these modern techniques
*15:47.940- 15:49.520* :  these modern scanning techniques
*15:49.520- 15:51.520* :  we can just pour through rock
*15:51.520- 15:53.460* :  with these high tech x-ray scanners
*15:53.460- 15:56.760* :  and actually see how these creatures were built
*15:57.360- 15:59.300* :  and these were exceptionally well-preserved
*15:59.380- 16:01.600* :  so this particular type of little mammal
*16:01.600- 16:03.960* :  from all that millions of years ago
*16:03.960- 16:06.000* :  we only have about a handful of them
*16:06.400- 16:10.420* :  and two of them in the Isle of Sky exceptionally well-preserved
*16:10.740- 16:13.920* :  so it just gives this incredible window into the past
*16:14.140- 16:16.940* :  Does that mean that continuous searches on the Isle of Sky
*16:16.940- 16:18.640* :  might throw up more answers
*16:18.640- 16:21.440* :  as to where we all came from to begin with
*16:21.440- 16:22.560* :  than that Jurassic era?
*16:23.300- 16:24.020* :  Yes absolutely
*16:24.020- 16:27.360* :  so it's only really by getting that fossil evidence
*16:27.580- 16:29.620* :  that you can really study the past
*16:29.780- 16:32.700* :  and then that together with things like genetic data
*16:33.000- 16:34.700* :  can give you a really good picture
*16:35.080- 16:36.260* :  of mammal evolution
*16:36.280- 16:39.160* :  and how mammals came to rule the world
*16:39.780- 16:41.960* :  Helen Briggs talking to James Reynolds
*16:45.340- 16:45.980* :  still to come
*16:46.300- 16:48.920* :  Komodo dragons the world's largest predatory lizard
*16:48.920- 16:50.600* :  has iron coated teeth
*16:50.760- 16:52.880* :  and they are absolutely razor sharp
*16:53.240- 16:56.280* :  why Komodo dragons are such dangerous predators
*17:05.100- 17:07.640* :  this podcast is brought to you by eHarmony
*17:07.640- 17:10.520* :  the dating app to find someone you can be yourself with
*17:11.120- 17:14.080* :  why doesn't eHarmony allow copy and paste in first messages

*18:16.100- 18:17.080* :  additional term supply
*18:22.460- 18:25.660* :  the Olympics are underway in Paris although the opening ceremony
*18:25.660- 18:30.840* :  isn't until Friday meanwhile a scandal which broke on Wednesday has rocked
*18:30.840- 18:33.200* :  the equestrian or horse riding world
*18:33.800- 18:35.920* :  the British athlete Charlotte du Jardin
*18:36.020- 18:38.800* :  was strongly tipped to win a gold in the dress arch
*18:39.280- 18:42.220* :  having already won three Olympic golds at previous games
*18:42.260- 18:47.960* :  but her dream is over after a video emerged which showed her whipping or horse
*18:48.600- 18:51.320* :  Mr Jardin has withdrawn from the games
*18:51.320- 18:54.340* :  and call the incident an error of judgment
*18:55.040- 18:58.720* :  she has also been provisionally suspended by the sports governing body
*18:59.360- 19:01.720* :  a lawyer for the whistleblower who released the video
*19:01.720- 19:06.080* :  said his client acted in an attempt to save dress arch
*19:06.760- 19:10.420* :  our sports correspondent Nester McGregor has been looking at the footage
*19:13.860- 19:18.860* :  it's a minute long video which has shaken equestrian sport to its very core
*19:21.140- 19:23.680* :  in it under guidance from Charlotte du Jardin
*19:24.040- 19:26.140* :  a young rider trots around the stable
*19:26.140- 19:30.760* :  the three-time Olympic gold medalist repeatedly strikes the animal with a long
*19:30.760- 19:34.300* :  schooling whip often used by trainers to get a horse
*19:34.620- 19:38.560* :  to raise its back legs higher as this is happening
*19:38.560- 19:41.880* :  giggling can be heard although it's unclear from whom
*19:42.760- 19:47.040* :  across numerous equestrian disciplines using a whip is common practice
*19:47.580- 19:49.640* :  although in this case it's clear to some
*19:49.640- 19:52.680* :  Charlotte du Jardin perhaps went too far
*19:53.880- 19:58.120* :  the 39-year-old released the statement yesterday before the video was made public
*19:58.660- 20:02.460* :  saying she was ashamed and her actions had been out of character
*20:02.880- 20:08.480* :  Goren Akastrom is veterinary director at the International Federation for Equestrian Sports
*20:09.000- 20:10.860* :  that's Equestrian's World governing body
*20:11.280- 20:19.020* :  the whip can be a tool to extend the information you want to give to the horse
*20:19.060- 20:21.240* :  but it has to be in a very mild way
*20:21.240- 20:26.080* :  it has to take into consideration the learning process of the horse
*20:26.420- 20:29.760* :  but if it's used as punishment or in a violent way
*20:29.760- 20:32.700* :  stressing the horse it's absolutely unacceptable
*20:33.420- 20:36.740* :  we don't know the identity of the woman who recorded the footage
*20:36.740- 20:39.840* :  Stefan Vensing the Dutch lawyer representing her
*20:40.220- 20:42.580* :  says it was recorded two and a half years ago
*20:42.580- 20:45.540* :  he said his clients had been afraid to come forward
*20:46.040- 20:47.620* :  and explained why now
*20:48.200- 20:50.260* :  she told me this morning
*20:51.400- 20:55.420* :  yeah this had to be done because I want to save Trasage as well
*20:55.420- 20:59.540* :  and I want top riders to stop bullying and abusing horses
*21:00.020- 21:04.160* :  Miss Du Jardin has been banned from competing while the sports governing body
*21:04.160- 21:06.100* :  carries out an investigation
*21:06.780- 21:09.000* :  two of her sponsors have cut ties with her
*21:09.420- 21:12.840* :  UK sport has also suspended her from using its facilities
*21:13.380- 21:15.500* :  or receiving publicly funded money
*21:16.260- 21:20.520* :  if she had won a medal in Paris she would have become team GB's
*21:20.820- 21:23.480* :  most decorated female Olympian
*21:24.080- 21:28.300* :  Nester McGregor for the first time a modern Olympics opening ceremony
*21:28.300- 21:32.800* :  won't be held in a stadium and the number of events will also have
*21:32.800- 21:35.260* :  Parisian landmarks as their backdrop too
*21:35.740- 21:38.380* :  from show jumping in front of the Palace of Versailles
*21:38.740- 21:40.600* :  to judo by the Eiffel Tower
*21:41.280- 21:43.540* :  but have the recent dramatic political events
*21:43.620- 21:46.620* :  a European election victory for the far right
*21:47.140- 21:50.320* :  President Macron shocked a solution of the national assembly
*21:50.900- 21:52.840* :  and now a hung parliament with no government
*21:52.900- 21:54.900* :  spoilt the party for the French
*21:55.600- 21:57.620* :  John Lawrence and went to Paris to find out
*22:00.220- 22:03.960* :  I see in the morning paper that the Olympic flames coming through Paris
*22:04.340- 22:06.560* :  figure out a time and place to see it in front of
*22:06.560- 22:08.480* :  Pairler shares cemetery seeing as you ask
*22:08.900- 22:12.500* :  and emerge from the metro on the same name into a happy crowd
*22:12.860- 22:15.480* :  lining a street that's already closed to traffic
*22:16.060- 22:20.940* :  good timing first come the police getting a few ironical but good humour cheers
*22:21.540- 22:25.040* :  a girl holds up her hand so they can high five her as they walk by
*22:25.660- 22:29.580* :  it is as this lady standing next to me attests a happy affair
*22:29.580- 22:33.860* :  despite the political drama and uncertainty in France at the moment
*22:34.920- 22:36.760* :  I think if you look around you everyone is quite
*22:38.200- 22:40.960* :  happy to see the the Olympic flame coming through
*22:41.640- 22:45.420* :  I think this is a really great way to get people together for a common cause
*22:46.020- 22:48.120* :  that's going to be a really nice way to start the summer
*22:48.720- 22:53.020* :  a wonderful summer and if you remember the London Olympics
*22:53.900- 22:58.040* :  everyone was complaining about what was going on in London and complaining about
*22:58.040- 23:01.020* :  works and it went really well there he goes
*23:02.440- 23:03.660* :  sorry I almost made you meet it there
*23:05.400- 23:07.940* :  but as luck would have it the torch bearer dressed in white
*23:08.400- 23:11.400* :  stops a few meters on to pass the flame on to the next
*23:11.400- 23:13.760* :  torch bearer dressed in white so we get a good look
*23:14.280- 23:17.000* :  through the forest of smartphones held aloft for the photo
*23:19.600- 23:22.260* :  as the crowd disperses I get talking to this gentleman
*23:22.720- 23:26.000* :  he says that with his unprovoked dissolution
*23:26.000- 23:28.520* :  President Macron has dampened the mood
*23:32.680- 23:35.120* :  he could have dissolved parliament after the Olympics
*23:35.740- 23:38.940* :  that would have allowed the French to enjoy this event with a measure of serenity
*23:39.400- 23:43.460* :  now it's difficult with no government and a lot of doubt about the political future of France
*23:45.520- 23:51.760* :  the following day is the one Paris Mayor and Idaal Gore chooses to finally swim in the same
*23:52.960- 23:58.980* :  to any skeptics out there that the river that runs through Paris is ready for Olympic athletes to dive into
*23:59.740- 24:03.660* :  shortly after which I go up to Saint-Saint-Denis the area north
*24:03.660- 24:08.620* :  east of Paris where most of the athletics is happening to meet David Roizen
*24:09.260- 24:13.020* :  his job is to think about sports for a centre-left
*24:13.020- 24:16.120* :  think tank called the Jean-Juresse foundation
*24:16.120- 24:21.060* :  he believes the Olympics were part of Macron's dissolution calculation
*24:21.060- 24:25.940* :  for the last two months where the torch was there was a huge celebration
*24:26.840- 24:31.480* :  and it was starting to have good press it could be a nice event finally
*24:32.180- 24:35.220* :  and then happen the dissolution with the dissolution
*24:35.220- 24:38.540* :  the Olympics disappear it break the wave
*24:38.540- 24:43.120* :  finally there was a starting wave in France about the Olympics it broke it
*24:43.340- 24:47.960* :  but to hazard another metaphor the French political machine is a broken down car
*24:48.600- 24:50.340* :  and given that it's not going to go anywhere soon
*24:50.340- 24:53.640* :  perhaps people will be tempted to leave it by the side of the road
*24:54.020- 24:58.240* :  wander into a village find a cafe with a television and settle down in front of the
*24:58.240- 25:01.940* :  hundred meters butterfly or something after all it's not every year
*25:01.940- 25:05.240* :  you host the Olympics John Lawrence and in Paris
*25:06.300- 25:10.300* :  the UN has warned that a target to eradicate world hunger by 2030
*25:10.300- 25:14.800* :  could be impossible to achieve the annual food security report
*25:14.820- 25:19.460* :  says that almost 10% of the world's population surface and malnutrition
*25:20.140- 25:24.920* :  in Africa the figures are twice as high the report shows that the world has been
*25:24.920- 25:30.680* :  set back 15 years with levels of hunger comparable to those in 2008
*25:31.360- 25:35.300* :  here's Maximo Toledo the chief economist of the Food and Agriculture
*25:35.300- 25:37.300* :  Organization of the UN
*25:37.820- 25:41.000* :  sadly this year the numbers have not changed from the previous years which were
*25:41.000- 25:44.340* :  already years where we have seen already the increase because of Covid-19
*25:44.840- 25:49.900* :  so what we are reporting is that we have between 713 million and 757 million
*25:49.900- 25:52.500* :  people which are chronic and nourished people facing hunger
*25:52.740- 25:55.440* :  but the other issue which is really important is the disparities
*25:55.920- 25:58.680* :  for example the region which is doing the worst is the African region
*25:58.680- 26:01.620* :  where we have one in five people facing hunger
*26:01.980- 26:05.580* :  Argentinava correspondent Imogen Fogues has the latest on the report
*26:06.660- 26:12.980* :  levels of hunger around the world are not decreasing despite the abundance of food in many parts
*26:13.620- 26:19.920* :  of our planet so what we're looking at is one in 11 people on the planet are going hungry
*26:20.640- 26:29.380* :  much worse in Africa one in five and the causes are very complex we have conflict we have
*26:29.380- 26:36.500* :  climate change food inflation but what it means is that this ambitious target that the UN set
*26:36.500- 26:44.040* :  this goal of eradicating hunger by 2030 is very very unlikely probably impossible to be reached
*26:44.280- 26:49.120* :  and you mentioned there the issue of the UN of facing and it does seem but even though the
*26:49.120- 26:55.040* :  pandemic has now passed in many parts of the world other problems seem to come at a great pace
*26:55.440- 27:02.780* :  well they certainly do and even before the Covid-19 pandemic which disrupted the global food supply
*27:02.780- 27:10.420* :  chains there were warnings about hunger we were talking and we still are about successive droughts
*27:10.440- 27:17.460* :  in parts of Africa now these are almost certainly climate change driven and what it means is that
*27:17.500- 27:22.520* :  the kind of food production that communities they are used to rely on they can't anymore
*27:23.400- 27:27.700* :  and then on top of that we seem to have conflict after conflict if you look at Sudan
*27:27.700- 27:34.780* :  over the last year and a half terrible civil conflict there and millions of people apparently
*27:34.780- 27:41.720* :  on the verge of famine and then of course we have had similar warnings about the conflict in Gaza
*27:41.720- 27:49.720* :  where levels of malnutrition have shot up faster than aid agencies have ever seen in a conflict
*27:50.080- 27:55.140* :  and virtually every country in the world claims to have a cost of living crisis does this make the
*27:55.140- 27:59.820* :  UN's job even more difficult because even countries which are seen to have the money say they
*27:59.820- 28:04.360* :  can't possibly release it for issues like this yeah I think that's absolutely right you hit the
*28:04.360- 28:10.380* :  nail on the head the wealthiest countries on the planet are our turning inwards we see that in
*28:10.380- 28:17.300* :  the United States we've seen that in western Europe where the concerns are their own cost of living
*28:17.300- 28:25.080* :  and the idea is we don't have the money to spare for problems that seem far away but what the UN
*28:25.080- 28:31.760* :  will tell you is if you can't address these problems those problems will only get bigger they will
*28:31.760- 28:39.520* :  lead to more instability to more people fleeing home so that the end of the day these are problems we
*28:39.520- 28:46.300* :  do have to solve together we can't ignore them image in folks now what's in a name a public
*28:46.300- 28:52.100* :  square in Moscow which was intended to be a symbol of friendship between Russia and the West after
*28:52.100- 28:58.380* :  decades of enmity during the Cold War has been renamed the flags of western countries which once
*28:58.380- 29:05.220* :  flew above Europe Square are now gone and as our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg explains so has
*29:05.220- 29:12.220* :  its name I'm standing on Europe Square in Moscow well what was until today Europe Square the cities
*29:12.220- 29:19.340* :  mayor has signed an order renaming the place Eurasia Square one little change that says a lot
*29:19.360- 29:25.600* :  about the direction in which Russia is moving away from the West 20 years ago this square was built
*29:25.600- 29:31.400* :  as a symbol of unity on the European continent but the reality is that Russia's war in Ukraine
*29:31.400- 29:37.320* :  and western sanctions have put enormous strain on relations between Moscow and Europe and the
*29:37.320- 29:44.040* :  Russian authorities talk constantly now of the need to tilt east to China North Korea Asia as a whole
*29:44.800- 29:49.860* :  but I wonder what do people hear on the square make of the name change the first person I talk to
*29:50.260- 29:57.620* :  is Maria it doesn't affect on me I'm from Siberia so I'm Asian in fact I guess I'm already not
*29:57.620- 30:07.780* :  European all got doesn't mind Europe she says is now friend anymore Europe has different standards
*30:07.780- 30:16.600* :  now Pasha says they think differently there we're splitting away but the Evgenia says she sad the
*30:16.600- 30:23.980* :  change of name she says is a sign of conflict between countries but you know after the 1917 Russian
*30:23.980- 30:30.680* :  revolution so many streets and squares in Russia were renamed to feature the word communism but it
*30:30.680- 30:36.820* :  didn't help Russia build communism you can remove the word Europe but it doesn't mean that Russia
*30:36.820- 30:46.700* :  won't one day once again look West Steve Rosenberg in Moscow they can weigh up to 150 kilos
*30:47.360- 30:52.600* :  and a more than two meters long they're living dragons and although they don't breathe fire
*30:52.600- 30:59.720* :  it's now been discovered that their teeth are coated in iron Komodo dragons which are native to
*30:59.720- 31:06.200* :  Indonesia already had a fearsome reputation for their venomous bite Aaron Leblanc a lecturer
*31:06.200- 31:12.160* :  in dental biosciences at King's College London led the latest study into the kimono
*31:13.080- 31:18.440* :  we've discovered that Komodo dragons the world's largest predatory lizard has iron coated teeth
*31:18.640- 31:23.620* :  has these razor blade like teeth with these serrations on the front and back and when you look at them
*31:23.940- 31:29.460* :  closely under a microscope it looks like someone's painted the cutting edges and tooth tips orange
*31:29.460- 31:35.500* :  and what that is is a really fine coating of iron and how much of a surprise was it to discover this
*31:35.660- 31:41.060* :  it was a huge surprise I've spent a long time looking at teeth of both living and fossil reptiles
*31:41.180- 31:46.740* :  and to be honest I wasn't looking for anything like this it was actually an accidental discovery
*31:46.920- 31:52.420* :  we were interested in how Komodo dragons use their serrated teeth to help them cut and tear through
*31:52.420- 31:57.240* :  prey and so when we started looking more closely at the teeth under the microscope I started to
*31:57.280- 32:02.820* :  realize I was seeing these strange stains it looked like on the teeth but once I started looking at
*32:02.820- 32:07.980* :  more museum specimens and colleagues started sharing photos of Komodo dragon teeth they had seen
*32:07.980- 32:13.460* :  in museums we realized that this was a feature consistent across Komodo dragons and it's something
*32:13.460- 32:16.900* :  that's built into their teeth and now you know what you're looking for do you think it's
*32:16.900- 32:22.280* :  possible we may find that other species may have iron teeth or iron coated teeth absolutely so
*32:22.280- 32:27.140* :  that's actually something we've just started to do in this study so we saw that it was very obvious
*32:27.140- 32:33.100* :  in Komodo dragons we looked in other relatives of the Komodo dragon within the monitor lizard family
*32:33.100- 32:39.680* :  and we did actually find orange cutting edges on the teeth of some other species and we even then
*32:39.680- 32:45.580* :  extended that search to some living crocodiles and alligators and there what was interesting is
*32:45.580- 32:51.020* :  they do also have iron concentrated along the cutting edges of some of their teeth but it's not as
*32:51.020- 32:57.140* :  consistent and oftentimes it's really hard to see under normal light and so it's possible that
*32:57.200- 33:03.200* :  it's a widespread feature among reptiles but it seems to be the most obvious and the most striking
*33:03.200- 33:08.260* :  in animals like the Komodo dragon and if you weren't scared by Komodo dragon already you will be now
*33:08.460- 33:12.800* :  absolutely so i've accidentally brushed my fingers against Komodo dragon teeth before
*33:12.800- 33:17.920* :  and they are absolutely razor sharp and i think this research is now telling us why that's the case
*33:18.380- 33:20.600* :  Aaron Leblanc from King's College London
*33:23.740- 33:28.460* :  and that's all for most for now but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later
