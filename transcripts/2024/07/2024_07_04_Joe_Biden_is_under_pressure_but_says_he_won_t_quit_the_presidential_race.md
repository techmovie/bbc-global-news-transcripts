*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?

*01:17.060- 01:20.560* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:21.600- 01:26.640* :  I'm Jackie Leonard, and in the early hours of Thursday, the 4th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:27.160- 01:32.480* :  The White House has insisted that President Biden is pressing ahead with his election campaign
*01:32.480- 01:36.380* :  after a report suggested he was weighing up whether to continue.
*01:36.720- 01:42.520* :  Hurricane Barrel has brought powerful winds and torrential rain as it roars along the south of Jamaica.
*01:43.240- 01:48.980* :  And a senior commander of the Lebanese armed movement, Hezbollah, has been killed in an Israeli air strike.
*01:50.640- 01:51.860* :  Also, in this podcast,
*01:51.860- 01:53.500* :  It's a complex scene.
*01:53.500- 01:59.320* :  We are, if large animals are in this case, a pig, and then you are the human-like figures that are playing with it.
*01:59.620- 02:05.220* :  Scientists believe that a 51,000-year-old painting found in a cave in Indonesia
*02:05.880- 02:08.620* :  is the world's oldest example of figurative art.
*02:12.620- 02:16.060* :  The US President Joe Biden is under mounting scrutiny,
*02:16.060- 02:21.100* :  following his stumbling performance in last week's televised debate with Donald Trump.
*02:21.760- 02:25.740* :  Another White House has been forced to deny a report in the New York Times,
*02:26.440- 02:31.620* :  suggesting that Joe Biden was weighing up whether to continue in November's presidential race.
*02:32.440- 02:34.720* :  Addressing the question during a media briefing,
*02:34.720- 02:38.660* :  the White House spokeswoman Karin Jean-Pierre dismissed speculation
*02:38.660- 02:42.700* :  that Mr. Biden was considering ending his bid for a second term.
*02:43.140- 02:46.340* :  The President is clear-eyed, and he is staying in the race.
*02:46.720- 02:48.240* :  I don't have anything else beyond that.
*02:48.360- 02:50.120* :  He is staying in the race.
*02:50.660- 02:53.020* :  That is what the President is promised to do.
*02:53.360- 02:57.740* :  That is what he wants to continue to work on the successes that he's had.
*02:57.740- 03:00.220* :  His record is unprecedented record,
*03:00.860- 03:04.840* :  and that is what the President is focused on, continuing to deliver for the American people.
*03:04.980- 03:05.980* :  And he looks forward to doing that.
*03:06.360- 03:09.580* :  Well, I spoke to my US correspondent Peter Bose on Wednesday evening,
*03:09.580- 03:13.740* :  and began by asking him if that White House comment draws a line under the matter.
*03:14.460- 03:16.000* :  No, in a word, it doesn't.
*03:16.000- 03:19.160* :  There is, Jackie, a head of steam swirling around this story
*03:19.160- 03:21.780* :  that I don't think has reached its peak yet.
*03:21.840- 03:26.420* :  The words in Washington that were hearing a lot repeatedly over the last few days
*03:26.420- 03:30.560* :  are panic mode to describe how many Democrats are feeling.
*03:31.060- 03:32.580* :  And there's a lot happening, as we speak.
*03:32.580- 03:36.880* :  Democratic governors are arriving at the White House for a meeting with the President.
*03:36.880- 03:42.620* :  And if they have concerns, this will be their opportunity to confront Mr. Biden with them.
*03:42.840- 03:45.360* :  There is reportedly a draft letter circulating,
*03:45.840- 03:48.300* :  perhaps more than one letter amongst House Democrats,
*03:48.980- 03:53.120* :  that may call for the President to quit the campaign over the next day or two.
*03:53.700- 03:57.280* :  Two congressmen have now openly called for Mr. Biden to pull out.
*03:57.760- 04:02.520* :  The New York Times is reporting that the Democratic Party don't read hastings,
*04:02.520- 04:06.620* :  who's a co-founder of Netflix has called for Mr. Biden to step down.
*04:06.620- 04:09.000* :  But as we have just heard from the White House,
*04:09.580- 04:10.800* :  they're saying it's not his intention.
*04:10.800- 04:14.440* :  In fact, the Biden campaign has just in the last few minutes sent out a message
*04:14.960- 04:18.880* :  from the President via text and email to his supporters.
*04:18.880- 04:20.720* :  It's a fundraising message, but it says,
*04:21.320- 04:23.580* :  folks, let me be clear, I'm running.
*04:23.620- 04:25.540* :  I'm the Democratic Party's nominee.
*04:26.040- 04:27.300* :  No one is pushing me out.
*04:27.300- 04:28.040* :  I'm not leaving.
*04:28.580- 04:29.900* :  I'm in this race to the end,
*04:29.900- 04:32.220* :  and we are going to win the election.
*04:32.860- 04:34.040* :  So he's pretty emphatic.
*04:34.480- 04:36.520* :  If he were to change his mind, as you say,
*04:36.960- 04:38.760* :  the pressure is still swirling around,
*04:39.680- 04:43.120* :  is it too late now for the Democrats to choose another candidate,
*04:43.120- 04:44.160* :  even if they want to?
*04:44.660- 04:46.540* :  It's very late in the election cycle,
*04:46.540- 04:48.420* :  but technically not too late,
*04:48.420- 04:51.320* :  because the candidates for both parties are not confirmed
*04:51.320- 04:56.080* :  until they go through the former process of selection at the party conventions,
*04:56.080- 04:59.000* :  which are coming up the Democrats meet next month.
*04:59.000- 05:03.340* :  What it would take, though, is for Joe Biden himself to stand down.
*05:03.340- 05:05.300* :  If he is unwilling to do that,
*05:05.680- 05:07.280* :  it will be extremely difficult,
*05:07.280- 05:10.520* :  pretty much impossible for the party to oust him.
*05:10.900- 05:12.680* :  Now, not to get too technical,
*05:12.680- 05:16.140* :  but if he were to say that he is going to go,
*05:16.320- 05:17.760* :  he would release his delegates,
*05:17.760- 05:20.420* :  those delegates that have already pledged support
*05:20.420- 05:22.160* :  through the primary election process,
*05:22.520- 05:25.440* :  and they would have an open convention,
*05:25.520- 05:28.520* :  and the race would then be on to quickly find a new candidate,
*05:28.520- 05:30.840* :  and currently the Vice President, Kamala Harris,
*05:31.420- 05:33.420* :  is the favourite to fulfil that role.
*05:34.220- 05:37.580* :  And meanwhile, how is all of this affecting polling?
*05:38.620- 05:40.560* :  Well, since the debate last week,
*05:40.580- 05:43.740* :  which really started all of this with Joe Biden's poor performance,
*05:43.740- 05:47.400* :  Donald Trump has increased his lead over Mr. Biden,
*05:47.400- 05:49.240* :  there has been a marked effect.
*05:49.240- 05:57.080* :  Different polls suggest that the former president is between three and six points ahead of Joe Biden now,
*05:57.080- 06:00.520* :  and perhaps the most worrying of all for the Democrats,
*06:00.520- 06:04.700* :  about three quarters of voters, seventy-seven-five percent,
*06:05.720- 06:06.500* :  according to the polls,
*06:06.920- 06:10.340* :  view Mr. Biden as simply too old for the job.
*06:10.920- 06:11.980* :  That was Peter Bowes.
*06:12.260- 06:16.120* :  Well, David Walters is a former Democratic governor of Oklahoma.
*06:16.120- 06:22.680* :  He's now one of only 45 people to sit on the executive of the Democrat National Committee.
*06:23.220- 06:26.720* :  Paul Henley asked him about his experience of seeing the debate,
*06:27.460- 06:28.720* :  was he watching through his fingers?
*06:29.600- 06:32.500* :  Uh, literally, in several people in the room,
*06:32.500- 06:33.800* :  we had some friends with us,
*06:33.800- 06:35.380* :  and we were looking through our fingers,
*06:35.540- 06:36.540* :  and just painful,
*06:36.580- 06:38.820* :  we had to have to stand up and walk out of the room.
*06:39.880- 06:44.560* :  It was a shocking and heartbreaking display
*06:44.560- 06:47.560* :  that kind of took us all by surprise.
*06:48.080- 06:49.120* :  So the media reaction,
*06:49.120- 06:52.200* :  describing it as a car crash, was not overblown?
*06:52.660- 06:53.560* :  No, not at all.
*06:53.560- 06:57.920* :  It was, you know, all of us have watched the President carefully
*06:57.920- 06:59.640* :  because he obviously is aging,
*07:00.440- 07:05.880* :  but we had no clue that being that well-prepared for a debate
*07:06.320- 07:09.180* :  would result in such a collaborative performance.
*07:09.180- 07:11.980* :  So it was really most unfortunate.
*07:12.380- 07:15.480* :  And how has the President's damaged imitation strategy gone?
*07:15.980- 07:18.640* :  Um, I think they're doing the best they can.
*07:18.640- 07:23.100* :  I mean, they're trying to have what the British would call a stiff upper lip,
*07:23.300- 07:25.900* :  but I have been involved in the briefing
*07:25.900- 07:28.000* :  from for the DNC members,
*07:28.000- 07:31.920* :  which had about 200 folks on the line last Saturday.
*07:31.920- 07:35.220* :  And while they mentioned the debate,
*07:35.380- 07:38.340* :  and they put it in the context of, you know,
*07:38.340- 07:41.340* :  a bad performance and one debate in 90 minutes
*07:41.340- 07:43.820* :  shouldn't define his administration, et cetera,
*07:44.120- 07:44.820* :  all of these terms.
*07:45.720- 07:48.360* :  But it was just, in many cases,
*07:48.360- 07:50.380* :  I think it's a little bit too much raw raw.
*07:50.380- 07:52.340* :  I think there needs to be a little bit more
*07:53.060- 07:57.000* :  appreciation for just how damaging and how bad this is,
*07:57.960- 08:00.940* :  and kind of an open discussion of the alternatives.
*08:01.560- 08:03.840* :  Well, I've heard several Democrats saying
*08:03.840- 08:05.820* :  there is no coming back from this.
*08:05.820- 08:06.620* :  Would you concur?
*08:07.280- 08:10.660* :  It's hard to imagine how the President could recover
*08:10.660- 08:13.480* :  from the decline in the polls.
*08:13.620- 08:18.040* :  I mean, he's, he was behind in all the key swing states
*08:18.060- 08:19.380* :  going into the debate.
*08:19.380- 08:22.480* :  And now he's, is in a deeper deficit
*08:22.520- 08:23.920* :  in those same swing states.
*08:23.920- 08:27.900* :  And now we are on the verge of losing New Mexico,
*08:27.900- 08:30.200* :  Virginia, New Hampshire, which are blue states.
*08:31.040- 08:33.840* :  And so, you know, it looks like on paper,
*08:36.200- 08:37.660* :  where campaigns go on forever.
*08:37.660- 08:39.540* :  So four months seems like a short time.
*08:39.540- 08:43.160* :  It looks like on paper that it is almost impossible
*08:43.160- 08:46.040* :  to recover from what today would be
*08:46.040- 08:48.260* :  an electoral college landslide.
*08:48.740- 08:50.920* :  David Walters, who's a member of the executive
*08:51.340- 08:53.100* :  of the Democratic National Committee.
*08:53.960- 08:55.740* :  Now, as we record this podcast,
*08:55.740- 08:58.800* :  Hurricane barrel is battering southern Jamaica
*08:59.300- 09:02.820* :  with sustained winds of up to 230 kilometers an hour.
*09:03.460- 09:05.900* :  There are reports of power cuts in many places,
*09:06.420- 09:07.720* :  including the Capitol Kingston.
*09:08.320- 09:11.860* :  The category for storm is already causing dangerous winds
*09:12.160- 09:13.280* :  and a sea surge.
*09:13.680- 09:15.880* :  The Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness
*09:16.180- 09:19.640* :  has declared a 12-hour daytime curfew across the island.
*09:19.640- 09:22.520* :  The hurricane caused extensive damage
*09:22.520- 09:24.180* :  on other Caribbean islands.
*09:24.860- 09:27.580* :  Seven people are known to have died so far.
*09:28.000- 09:30.640* :  Paul Henley spoke to the minister of local government
*09:30.640- 09:32.560* :  in Jamaica, Desmond McKenzie,
*09:33.040- 09:34.720* :  and asked him what the latest news was.
*09:35.460- 09:37.900* :  Sections of the island has been in the field.
*09:37.900- 09:41.520* :  If they're coming, they have been a rainfall, as I speak.
*09:41.520- 09:46.080* :  Ghosty winds, we have had our fallen trees in some areas.
*09:46.080- 09:48.960* :  We have had our roads which are becoming possible
*09:48.960- 09:51.820* :  in the last half-power in some areas.
*09:51.820- 09:56.780* :  So we are beginning to feel the eat of the hurricane.
*09:57.160- 09:59.120* :  And how are you preparing local people?
*09:59.300- 10:03.800* :  We did our mitigation exercise over a week ago.
*10:03.800- 10:05.420* :  We had been advising people.
*10:05.420- 10:08.300* :  We have been cleaning our drains, cutting down trees.
*10:09.060- 10:12.880* :  And we have had a robust public education program
*10:12.880- 10:16.580* :  sensitizing Jamaicans, especially persons
*10:16.900- 10:20.200* :  who live in communities which are prone to flooding.
*10:20.900- 10:24.320* :  We have over some 800 shelters across the country
*10:24.360- 10:27.900* :  and almost 80% of the shelters have been activated.
*10:28.620- 10:30.460* :  We put the systems in place.
*10:30.460- 10:33.460* :  Jamaicans were advised early
*10:33.460- 10:36.320* :  and Jamaicans were aware of the danger.
*10:36.620- 10:38.800* :  Presumably, as usually happens,
*10:38.900- 10:41.320* :  it's the poorer communities who are most at risk,
*10:41.360- 10:43.240* :  the flimsiest buildings and so on.
*10:43.980- 10:48.180* :  That is so but one good thing that you have seen in the country.
*10:48.180- 10:50.980* :  We have learned from Hurricane Gilbert
*10:50.980- 10:56.140* :  with struck us in 1988, the importance of solid buildings.
*10:56.720- 11:00.020* :  And do you think Jamaicans sort of accept hurricanes
*11:00.020- 11:03.040* :  as a more frequent feature of life these days?
*11:03.620- 11:06.920* :  We are prone to this and we are becoming more sophisticated
*11:06.920- 11:11.200* :  in terms of how all our citizens are educated
*11:11.200- 11:14.840* :  and the role and the importance of being conscious
*11:14.840- 11:19.340* :  and aware of where we are located as a country.
*11:19.680- 11:21.580* :  But it's becoming increasingly clear, isn't it,
*11:21.580- 11:23.620* :  that climate change is driving an increase
*11:23.620- 11:25.300* :  in these extreme events?
*11:25.400- 11:28.660* :  Does that make the population of Jamaica more aware
*11:28.660- 11:31.440* :  of stopping climate change, taking measures themselves?
*11:31.440- 11:33.520* :  Does it make you as a government more determined?
*11:34.200- 11:35.020* :  Yes, it does.
*11:35.240- 11:37.280* :  And we have been taking steps there
*11:37.280- 11:40.140* :  to minimize the effects of climate change.
*11:40.140- 11:44.400* :  But the reality is that the great countries in the world
*11:44.400- 11:47.000* :  who are exporting climate change,
*11:47.000- 11:49.240* :  the small living up in states like Jamaica,
*11:50.040- 11:54.400* :  in our region, we do not possess some of what is required
*11:54.400- 11:57.540* :  to export our climate change.
*11:58.200- 11:59.600* :  We are playing all apart.
*12:00.000- 12:02.340* :  Meanwhile, what's the mood on the island tonight?
*12:02.340- 12:03.400* :  It must be tense.
*12:04.140- 12:05.400* :  Well, it is very tense.
*12:05.540- 12:08.760* :  We will not know until sometime tomorrow
*12:09.080- 12:10.560* :  the government will respond.
*12:10.560- 12:12.360* :  What are the good things about it?
*12:13.060- 12:15.800* :  Is that this administration of Prime Minister Anger
*12:15.800- 12:19.240* :  on this, have put in place the necessary security
*12:19.960- 12:21.960* :  for the country in terms of financing.
*12:22.800- 12:26.940* :  We have had insurance bonds that will ensure that the country
*12:27.560- 12:31.220* :  will be able to respond to any infrastructure damage
*12:31.760- 12:32.680* :  that has been created.
*12:32.800- 12:35.460* :  I want to say to the Jamaican population
*12:35.460- 12:38.960* :  in the ear part of the world that we are hanging on
*12:39.040- 12:41.800* :  and we are asking them to remember us in the address.
*12:42.880- 12:45.380* :  That was the Minister of Local Government in Jamaica,
*12:45.380- 12:46.680* :  Desmond McKenzie.
*12:47.240- 12:49.600* :  The hurricane has already caused extensive damage
*12:49.760- 12:51.340* :  on other Caribbean islands.
*12:52.640- 12:55.580* :  One of the most senior commanders of the Lebanese armed group
*12:55.580- 12:59.060* :  Hezbollah has been killed in an Israeli airstrike.
*12:59.480- 13:01.280* :  Reports say the man who has been named
*13:01.280- 13:02.740* :  as Muhammad Nima Nasr
*13:03.060- 13:06.320* :  died when his car was hit near the southern city of Tyre.
*13:06.900- 13:08.720* :  The killing is the latest in a string
*13:08.720- 13:12.260* :  of Israeli assassinations of Hezbollah commanders in Lebanon.
*13:12.840- 13:15.460* :  Our correspondent Hugo Bachega is in Beirut.
*13:25.220- 13:29.900* :  Against Israel and they said that this commander was involved
*13:29.900- 13:31.680* :  in a number of attacks.
*13:31.680- 13:34.580* :  So a high profile Hezbollah figure.
*13:35.100- 13:37.240* :  And again I think what's significant here is that
*13:37.240- 13:40.140* :  is the second senior Hezbollah commander
*13:40.140- 13:41.680* :  who's been killed by Israel
*13:42.240- 13:44.380* :  here in Lebanon in less than a month.
*13:44.380- 13:47.560* :  So this campaign of targeted killings
*13:47.620- 13:49.720* :  by the Israeli military continues
*13:49.720- 13:53.040* :  as this violence between Hezbollah and Israel
*13:53.560- 13:54.360* :  continues as well.
*13:54.980- 13:57.680* :  And previous killings of Hezbollah fighters
*13:57.680- 13:59.160* :  senior Hezbollah figures
*13:59.760- 14:02.200* :  have elicited a response from Hezbollah.
*14:02.200- 14:03.380* :  So what's expected?
*14:03.740- 14:06.380* :  This response for at least part of it has already happened
*14:06.380- 14:08.740* :  because just hours ago Hezbollah said
*14:09.160- 14:11.300* :  it had launched a hundred rockets
*14:11.300- 14:14.520* :  at Israeli military sites in Northern Israel.
*14:15.100- 14:16.580* :  There were no reports of casualties.
*14:16.640- 14:18.880* :  But this is the new routine here.
*14:19.020- 14:21.160* :  We've seen that this is what's become the reality
*14:21.160- 14:22.140* :  along the border.
*14:22.600- 14:25.260* :  Those attacks, those counterattacks
*14:25.660- 14:27.800* :  some days are more violent and some days are quieter.
*14:28.420- 14:30.660* :  Both sides continue to indicate
*14:30.660- 14:32.800* :  that they want to avoid a major confrontation
*14:32.980- 14:34.980* :  but obviously there's always the fear
*14:35.360- 14:37.020* :  of miscalculation here.
*14:37.380- 14:40.260* :  You've talked about a routine now of attack
*14:40.260- 14:41.480* :  and counter attack.
*14:41.480- 14:43.860* :  Just how serious is this situation
*14:43.920- 14:45.680* :  between Israel and Hezbollah?
*14:46.000- 14:48.840* :  So Hezbollah say that what they're doing here
*14:49.080- 14:51.220* :  is in support for Palestinians in Gaza.
*14:51.360- 14:53.300* :  They say that any cease firing Gaza
*14:53.300- 14:55.560* :  will be observed here in Lebanon.
*14:55.560- 14:57.360* :  And we know that talks for a deal
*14:57.360- 15:00.240* :  between Israel and Hamas are stalled.
*15:00.240- 15:02.600* :  So these attacks have continued.
*15:03.180- 15:05.040* :  There has been an escalation of tensions
*15:05.440- 15:06.560* :  in the last month or so.
*15:06.740- 15:09.240* :  And the rhetoric has also escalated,
*15:09.240- 15:10.960* :  especially from Israeli leaders.
*15:11.440- 15:13.880* :  They say that this situation is unsustainable,
*15:14.420- 15:17.840* :  that no country would accept being on the receiving end
*15:17.840- 15:20.420* :  of missiles and rockets almost every day.
*15:20.940- 15:22.680* :  And that they want to restore security
*15:23.280- 15:24.480* :  in the northern part of the country
*15:24.480- 15:27.080* :  to allow the return of tens of thousands
*15:27.080- 15:28.600* :  of people who've been displaced.
*15:28.740- 15:30.900* :  And they say that if diplomacy fails
*15:31.400- 15:35.080* :  there will use military force to change the situation.
*15:35.180- 15:37.040* :  And I think people here in Lebanon
*15:37.040- 15:39.360* :  still remember what happened in 2006
*15:39.360- 15:40.800* :  that the last time there was a war
*15:40.800- 15:42.220* :  between Hezbollah and Israel
*15:42.800- 15:45.080* :  and they fear we could end up seeing
*15:45.520- 15:46.360* :  even more destruction.
*15:46.940- 15:49.000* :  That was Yuga Bachega in Beirut.
*15:50.160- 15:52.700* :  A new study has found that when trotting
*15:52.920- 15:55.320* :  hippos can briefly become airborne.
*15:55.320- 15:57.920* :  Researchers say that when moving fast,
*15:58.320- 15:59.900* :  the animals' feet leave the ground
*15:59.900- 16:01.940* :  for up to a third of a second at a time.
*16:02.460- 16:03.540* :  Camilla Mills reports.
*16:03.620- 16:06.580* :  By contrast to hippos, elephants can only walk
*16:06.580- 16:09.740* :  and all four feet never leave the ground simultaneously.
*16:10.380- 16:12.380* :  The findings from Britain's Royal Veterinary College
*16:12.380- 16:15.060* :  suggest hippos are able to push the limits
*16:15.060- 16:16.960* :  of what giant land animals can do.
*16:17.380- 16:19.100* :  They are among the largest land creatures
*16:19.560- 16:21.680* :  and can often weigh more than two tons.
*16:22.240- 16:23.320* :  The lead author of the study
*16:23.320- 16:25.540* :  said part of the reason so little research
*16:25.540- 16:26.900* :  has been done into hippos
*16:27.300- 16:29.140* :  is because they tend to stick to the water
*16:29.520- 16:31.020* :  and are also very dangerous.
*16:31.800- 16:32.380* :  Camilla Mills.
*16:34.740- 16:35.320* :  Still to come.
*16:35.320- 16:36.920* :  When he put the afterburners on,
*16:37.060- 16:39.320* :  there was only ever going to be one winner.
*16:39.700- 16:43.000* :  Even his opponents were happy to cheer him on.
*16:43.240- 16:45.440* :  A cycling record broken by the British
*16:45.760- 16:46.500* :  Sprint Champion,
*16:46.600- 16:47.740* :  Mark Cavendish.
*16:53.880- 16:55.840* :  Hi, I'm Daniel, founder of PrettyLitter.
*16:56.040- 16:58.520* :  Did you know cats tend to hide symptoms of sickness and pain?
*16:58.520- 17:01.280* :  I learned this the hard way after losing my cat, Genji.
*17:01.420- 17:04.240* :  So I created PrettyLitter, a health monitoring litter
*17:04.240- 17:06.040* :  that helps detect early signs of illness
*17:06.040- 17:08.120* :  by changing colors, saving you money
*17:08.420- 17:09.960* :  and potentially your cat's life.
*17:09.960- 17:12.040* :  PrettyLitter is veterinarian developed
*17:12.040- 17:14.060* :  and it's the easiest way to keep tabs
*17:14.060- 17:15.980* :  on your fur baby's health right at home.

*17:21.480- 17:23.520* :  Terms and conditions apply seaside for details.
*17:24.000- 17:26.440* :  John Grisham welcomes you back to Camino Island
*17:26.440- 17:30.240* :  in his number one New York Times bestseller, Camino Ghosts.
*17:30.680- 17:32.980* :  This time, a 300-year-old curse
*17:32.980- 17:35.860* :  is stirring up more trouble and paradise than ever before.
*17:36.760- 17:38.580* :  Whether you're traveling with friends or family
*17:38.580- 17:40.340* :  or staying close to home this summer,
*17:40.340- 17:43.520* :  everyone can get on the same page with this intriguing novel
*17:43.780- 17:45.620* :  that delivers sun, sand, and mystery.
*17:46.460- 17:48.040* :  Camino Ghosts is in stores now,
*17:48.520- 17:51.320* :  also available as an audiobook read by Woopy Goldberg.
*17:56.620- 17:59.660* :  Reports from Belarus say a leading opposition figure
*18:00.000- 18:01.560* :  who stood for the country's presidency
*18:01.560- 18:03.220* :  has been released from prison.
*18:03.700- 18:05.620* :  He joins hundreds of other prisoners
*18:06.080- 18:08.900* :  released to mark the country's independence day celebrations.
*18:09.840- 18:12.500* :  But human rights groups say Belarus still has
*18:12.500- 18:16.780* :  more than 1,400 political prisoners behind bars.
*18:17.360- 18:21.340* :  East Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford has been following this story.
*18:21.740- 18:23.200* :  For now, we don't know a huge amount
*18:23.280- 18:26.280* :  because whenever a political prisoner is released in Belarus,
*18:26.280- 18:29.640* :  those who know their names keep them quiet for their own safety,
*18:29.640- 18:32.420* :  for some time often these people when they get out of prison finally
*18:32.820- 18:35.040* :  flee the country and they want to be able to do that safely.
*18:35.040- 18:38.460* :  So for now, we know the name of one person for sure.
*18:38.820- 18:40.700* :  His name is Gory Kustussov.
*18:40.700- 18:45.260* :  He was a presidential election candidate back in 2010,
*18:46.060- 18:47.860* :  but he was arrested in 2021.
*18:48.520- 18:51.220* :  He was sentenced after that to 10 years in prison
*18:51.220- 18:55.060* :  as part of what became known as the coup plot allegations
*18:55.060- 18:58.560* :  that he and other opposition figures have been plotting to seize power.
*18:59.080- 19:02.640* :  Now, those claims, those charges are political charges.
*19:03.200- 19:04.940* :  It basically anyone who is in opposition
*19:05.000- 19:07.480* :  to Alexander Lukashenko, many, many people,
*19:07.480- 19:09.660* :  hundreds and hundreds of people have been rounded up
*19:10.060- 19:13.680* :  and arrested since a huge wave of protests against the president
*19:14.080- 19:15.040* :  back in 2020.
*19:15.140- 19:17.840* :  So the release of one man is confirmed.
*19:17.980- 19:20.660* :  We know that there are possibly five people in total
*19:20.660- 19:22.780* :  who've been released so far, maybe six.
*19:22.880- 19:25.580* :  But as I say, their names haven't yet been released.
*19:25.600- 19:28.480* :  And this was announced by Alexander Lukashenko in advance.
*19:28.580- 19:32.440* :  He told people not to be surprised if some political prisoners were released
*19:32.440- 19:36.260* :  when he announced a giant amnesty of prisoners generally.
*19:36.520- 19:39.720* :  He said this was a humane act he was claiming
*19:39.760- 19:43.100* :  because the people he plans to release are seriously ill.
*19:43.100- 19:46.420* :  And that includes Mr. Kustussov, who has cancer.
*19:46.420- 19:48.760* :  He discovered when he was in prison that he had cancer.
*19:49.180- 19:51.340* :  And I believe he's actually extremely sick.
*19:51.900- 19:54.140* :  And when we talk about jailed dissidents,
*19:54.900- 19:56.880* :  what sort of people are we actually talking about?
*19:57.160- 19:59.560* :  Well, in many cases, we're talking about journalists,
*19:59.560- 20:05.300* :  analysts, experts, just regular people who have held a blog,
*20:05.300- 20:06.800* :  who've stood up in a protest,
*20:06.800- 20:09.960* :  people who are known to be associated with leaders
*20:09.960- 20:11.940* :  of the oppositional members of the opposition,
*20:11.940- 20:15.440* :  people who took part in or have been somehow linked
*20:15.440- 20:18.320* :  to those massive opposition protests in 2020.
*20:18.320- 20:21.160* :  It is just ordinary people who've dared to speak out.
*20:21.220- 20:23.140* :  Or in some cases, hadn't even spoken out,
*20:23.140- 20:26.160* :  but have been sort of pointed to as opposition figures.
*20:26.460- 20:30.500* :  People who are opposed to the authoritarian rule of Alexander Lukashenko.
*20:30.800- 20:33.500* :  Many of them are in exile, but 1400 are in prison.
*20:33.540- 20:35.500* :  And some of the most famous names among them
*20:35.820- 20:38.640* :  have been held in Communicardo for months and months.
*20:38.740- 20:42.080* :  No word of them at all, no visits, no idea how they are.
*20:42.080- 20:44.240* :  So there's a famous people like Maria Kolesnikova,
*20:44.660- 20:46.580* :  who became extremely well-known in Bialouse
*20:46.580- 20:49.180* :  when she led the opposition protests in 2020.
*20:49.900- 20:53.980* :  Sarah Reinsford, a new law banning the traditional practice
*20:53.980- 20:56.180* :  of child marriage in Sierra Leone,
*20:56.180- 20:58.960* :  has been signed by President Julius Marabillo.
*20:59.780- 21:02.380* :  It means anyone involved in arranging the marriage
*21:02.380- 21:06.200* :  of girls under 18 could get 15 years in jail
*21:06.540- 21:08.020* :  and or a hefty fine.
*21:08.660- 21:10.260* :  Although the number of child marriages
*21:10.260- 21:12.500* :  has dropped slightly in recent years,
*21:13.000- 21:15.780* :  it's still widespread with 30% of girls
*21:15.780- 21:17.600* :  married before the age of 18
*21:17.660- 21:20.400* :  and 9% before the age of 15.
*21:20.420- 21:24.200* :  Rebecca Kesby spoke to the first lady of Sierra Leone,
*21:24.440- 21:25.140* :  Fatemabillo.
*21:25.540- 21:29.000* :  The enactment of this bill is well overdue
*21:29.000- 21:31.640* :  because it is a personal battle for myself.
*21:32.060- 21:33.200* :  I was a victim.
*21:33.660- 21:35.660* :  I was married off when I was 12 years old.
*21:36.500- 21:38.080* :  Unfortunately, due to the war,
*21:38.320- 21:39.980* :  the person I was married off too
*21:39.980- 21:42.040* :  was not able to have me
*21:42.500- 21:44.120* :  and taking over my life.
*21:44.360- 21:45.880* :  But I knew I was married off.
*21:45.880- 21:49.140* :  I knew they were waiting for me to just do my GCC
*21:49.140- 21:51.880* :  and then I was going to go and be with this man
*21:51.880- 21:54.700* :  who was 20, 25 years older than me.
*21:54.860- 21:57.480* :  I lived with that experience all my life
*21:57.700- 22:01.160* :  and every time I see a child goes through something like that,
*22:01.420- 22:03.080* :  I knew exactly what they were going through.
*22:03.080- 22:04.040* :  You have no hope.
*22:04.560- 22:08.020* :  I don't know if it's possible to describe that feeling.
*22:08.300- 22:09.980* :  So knowing at the age of 12,
*22:10.300- 22:12.460* :  the name of the man you're supposed to marry
*22:12.460- 22:13.920* :  who you probably have nothing
*22:13.920- 22:16.900* :  in common with him being so much older than you,
*22:17.360- 22:20.300* :  what sort of impact does that have on you psychologically?
*22:20.940- 22:21.800* :  It breaks you completely.
*22:21.800- 22:23.700* :  You have no hope for anything.
*22:23.720- 22:26.300* :  You don't even enjoy your education anymore
*22:26.300- 22:27.980* :  because you know that your education
*22:27.980- 22:29.620* :  is not going to benefit you.
*22:29.880- 22:33.240* :  So for me, that is like taking away a child's dream
*22:33.760- 22:36.640* :  and destroying them even before they knew who they are.
*22:37.100- 22:40.400* :  And that is an abuse that no one can repair.
*22:40.400- 22:44.300* :  I still hate my immediate family for trying to do that.
*22:44.860- 22:47.980* :  You continue to breed a cycle of children
*22:47.980- 22:51.200* :  who will not be educated, who will not be empowered,
*22:51.380- 22:53.320* :  who cannot contribute to nation-building
*22:53.500- 22:55.240* :  and they become their ability to themselves
*22:55.240- 22:57.440* :  to their family and to the nation.
*22:58.000- 23:00.520* :  Fatima Bio, the first lady of Sierra Leone.
*23:01.480- 23:02.960* :  Now, we hear a lot about AI
*23:02.960- 23:04.800* :  or artificial intelligence
*23:04.800- 23:06.420* :  and its possible impact.
*23:07.040- 23:09.720* :  Now, it seems that the global greenhouse gas emissions
*23:09.720- 23:12.160* :  of the U.S. technology giant Google
*23:12.680- 23:16.080* :  were nearly 50% higher last year than in 2019.
*23:17.040- 23:18.520* :  That's because of the increasing amounts
*23:18.560- 23:21.080* :  of energy needed by its computer servers
*23:21.500- 23:25.060* :  fueled by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence.
*23:25.560- 23:28.520* :  This will make achieving so-called net zero emissions
*23:28.520- 23:31.780* :  by 2030 significantly more difficult.
*23:32.780- 23:36.500* :  So why does AI require so much more computer power
*23:36.500- 23:37.240* :  and electricity?
*23:37.240- 23:40.520* :  A question for our technology reporter, Chris Valenz.
*23:41.080- 23:42.980* :  There are lots of different kinds of AI
*23:42.980- 23:45.840* :  and some AI doesn't require much electricity at all
*23:45.840- 23:48.940* :  like the kind you sort of you might have in the most modern
*23:48.940- 23:49.740* :  sort of smartphones.
*23:50.860- 23:52.980* :  But when you talk about things like
*23:53.460- 23:56.480* :  the kind of chat programs, the generative AI programs
*23:56.480- 23:58.820* :  that image creators, video creators,
*23:59.380- 24:01.960* :  and the chat programs that have really taken off
*24:02.180- 24:04.440* :  in the past couple of years,
*24:05.420- 24:10.300* :  those are based on an awful lot of computing power.
*24:11.500- 24:13.660* :  Warehouse is full of computing effectively.
*24:14.620- 24:16.660* :  And like your computer at home,
*24:16.660- 24:18.880* :  they need energy to run
*24:18.880- 24:22.560* :  and they also need energy to help keep them cool
*24:22.560- 24:24.040* :  because like computers at home,
*24:24.460- 24:26.300* :  they get hot when they're running as well.
*24:26.520- 24:27.980* :  And I don't know if you've ever been inside
*24:27.980- 24:29.300* :  one of these data centers.
*24:29.900- 24:32.520* :  The cooling, the air conditioning is kind of,
*24:32.520- 24:34.000* :  it sounds like a bit of a hurricane.
*24:34.000- 24:36.080* :  You know, it's really loud.
*24:36.080- 24:37.680* :  There's a lot of effort going on there.
*24:38.480- 24:41.640* :  And so you see the energy consumption rise
*24:41.640- 24:44.680* :  and of course that has an impact on emissions.
*24:45.020- 24:46.840* :  And that's difficult for these companies.
*24:46.840- 24:48.500* :  I mean Google, for example,
*24:49.180- 24:52.580* :  has a net zero emission target by 2030
*24:53.100- 24:56.300* :  and a similar kind of target to reduce
*24:56.300- 24:58.600* :  the absolute amount of emissions as well
*24:59.120- 25:00.660* :  by nearly 50%.
*25:00.700- 25:03.880* :  So that makes that much, much harder
*25:03.880- 25:05.000* :  because of course all these companies
*25:05.000- 25:07.460* :  are racing to jump on the AI bandwagon.
*25:07.460- 25:11.000* :  Clearly there's a huge business case for doing it.
*25:11.700- 25:13.260* :  And so you know, they're sort of,
*25:13.620- 25:15.320* :  there's push and pull there.
*25:15.540- 25:17.040* :  You know, on the one hand, they're making serious efforts
*25:17.040- 25:17.940* :  to reduce their emissions.
*25:17.940- 25:20.300* :  On the other hand, there's a business imperative
*25:20.740- 25:24.640* :  to adopt AI and to push for AI innovation.
*25:25.300- 25:27.360* :  So does it really boil down to a choice
*25:27.360- 25:31.440* :  between reducing emissions and increasing AI research?
*25:31.900- 25:35.340* :  Well, I think that Google would argue not.
*25:35.580- 25:39.640* :  I mean, firstly, they'll point to the big use of renewables.
*25:39.960- 25:44.060* :  And secondly, they'll point to increasing efficiencies
*25:44.060- 25:46.160* :  of the chips and the technology.
*25:46.700- 25:50.400* :  And thirdly, I think they'd point to AI being used
*25:50.400- 25:52.780* :  to develop technologies and innovation
*25:53.220- 25:54.680* :  that reduce carbon emissions.
*25:54.820- 25:56.880* :  So I mean, the kind of things they talk about
*25:56.920- 26:01.300* :  in their environmental report is technology
*26:01.300- 26:04.520* :  that times traffic lights, for example,
*26:04.520- 26:08.580* :  so that you reduce the stop start of traffic.
*26:08.860- 26:11.180* :  And that being based on AI and also talk about,
*26:11.180- 26:13.420* :  you know, route planning and more efficient route planning.
*26:13.940- 26:17.660* :  And also, you know, we've seen advances in sort of technology
*26:18.440- 26:20.600* :  that will reduce energy consumption of attack
*26:20.600- 26:22.780* :  and better design of chips and software
*26:22.780- 26:24.700* :  that has also come out of AI.
*26:25.320- 26:27.280* :  Does it look like this is going to,
*26:27.680- 26:29.420* :  although it's a fairly eye-catching headline,
*26:29.940- 26:34.020* :  does it look like this is going to be a temporary blip
*26:34.060- 26:36.400* :  as we sort of get into a more AI world?
*26:36.560- 26:40.040* :  I think that depends on your definition of temporary, really.
*26:41.800- 26:44.340* :  I mean, yeah, there are promising technologies on the horizon,
*26:44.360- 26:47.880* :  but also, you know, there are some pretty blunt calculations out there.
*26:47.880- 26:50.400* :  I mean, if you look at, for example,
*26:50.420- 26:53.020* :  the sales of the most popular AI chips
*26:53.020- 26:55.480* :  and then do the maths of, well, if they all sold,
*26:55.900- 26:57.480* :  how much energy would that take up?
*26:57.500- 26:59.340* :  You come up with some pretty big numbers.
*26:59.340- 27:03.180* :  So I think we're kind of at the frontier of AI technology.
*27:03.260- 27:05.960* :  People talk about artificial general intelligence,
*27:05.960- 27:07.780* :  which is more human-like AI.
*27:08.300- 27:09.200* :  That was Chris Valens.
*27:09.820- 27:11.180* :  Some cycling news now.
*27:11.520- 27:14.160* :  The British sprint champion, Mark Cavendish,
*27:14.380- 27:16.880* :  has won the fifth stage of this year's Tour de France,
*27:16.880- 27:19.840* :  securing victory with a powerful late finish.
*27:19.840- 27:22.440* :  He said the Tour de France had changed his life.
*27:22.720- 27:26.660* :  This race definitely has given me the life in the career I had.
*27:26.800- 27:28.360* :  I've always shown that the respected deserves.
*27:28.740- 27:31.160* :  And we all know that it's bigger than a white race,
*27:31.360- 27:34.640* :  the Tour de France, and the real dream of riding it,
*27:35.120- 27:37.400* :  grew a bit older and dreamed of riding it,
*27:37.880- 27:41.340* :  winning here, and then I dreamed of winning more and more.
*27:42.100- 27:45.140* :  But the win isn't just another stage of a famous race.
*27:45.540- 27:47.880* :  Our reporter Pierre Vickery explained why
*27:47.880- 27:50.320* :  Wednesday's victory was such a big deal.
*27:51.020- 27:53.180* :  Let me give you a little bit of context.
*27:53.220- 28:00.920* :  Eddie Merck's 1975, he wins his 34th victory in the Tour de France.
*28:01.000- 28:04.500* :  It's a win, everybody says it'll never be beaten.
*28:04.500- 28:09.160* :  2021, Mark Cavendish equals that record.
*28:09.160- 28:13.480* :  And he's gone one better, and he is now on his own,
*28:13.480- 28:17.920* :  the all-time cycling champion from the Tour de France.
*28:18.340- 28:23.280* :  So it's a very exciting day, and it's also the way he did it.
*28:23.700- 28:27.640* :  You could just see, I was watching the last few meters of that race,
*28:27.660- 28:31.700* :  as he carefully navigated his way through his competitors.
*28:32.260- 28:36.280* :  And when he put the afterburners on, there was only ever going to be one winner.
*28:36.720- 28:40.560* :  And what's so nice about this story is that even his opponents
*28:40.560- 28:42.660* :  were happy to cheer him on.
*28:42.720- 28:46.580* :  The whole of cycling is so excited by today's big victory.
*28:46.580- 28:53.080* :  Let me quickly give you a touch of context, because what's so important about this story,
*28:53.080- 28:56.420* :  you might say I don't follow a cyclist, why should I care?
*28:56.780- 28:59.040* :  It's really a story about the human condition.
*28:59.560- 29:03.860* :  When he did his 34th victory in 21, everybody said,
*29:03.860- 29:05.860* :  oh, the next one will be soon.
*29:06.340- 29:10.120* :  But no, it wasn't. He was brought down. He broke a collarbone.
*29:10.600- 29:14.320* :  And even earlier this week, in the first stage of this year's race,
*29:14.320- 29:19.840* :  he was all by himself at the back. He came in 40 minutes after all the others.
*29:20.260- 29:25.200* :  And he was within a whisker of being thrown out of the race for missing the cutoff.
*29:25.600- 29:28.520* :  So here he is. One day, he's right at the back.
*29:29.260- 29:31.640* :  And then here we are today with him.
*29:32.320- 29:35.700* :  All at the front couldn't be further forward if you tried.
*29:36.120- 29:38.380* :  And I think that is what people will remember.
*29:38.880- 29:42.420* :  A nice guy who wins, who can't like that story.
*29:43.220- 29:44.180* :  That was Pierre Vickery.
*29:45.080- 29:48.300* :  Scientists believe they have found the oldest example of
*29:48.300- 29:53.680* :  representational art in a cave on the Indonesian island of South Sulawesi.
*29:53.680- 29:58.460* :  The Australian and Indonesian researchers say the wall painting of a pig
*29:58.460- 30:02.900* :  and three human-like figures is more than 51,000 years old.
*30:03.140- 30:07.820* :  That's 5,000 years older than the cave art previously thought to be the oldest.
*30:07.860- 30:10.880* :  Their findings have been published in the journal Nature.
*30:11.460- 30:13.720* :  Our science correspondent Palab Gosh reports.
*30:14.460- 30:19.240* :  The discovery is important because it pushes back the time that modern humans first showed
*30:19.240- 30:21.020* :  the ability for creative thought.
*30:21.860- 30:25.420* :  The painting shows a pig standing with its mouth partly open
*30:26.000- 30:29.260* :  with at least three other human-like figures interacting with it.
*30:29.900- 30:34.240* :  The largest of them has both arms extended and appears to be holding a rod
*30:34.580- 30:35.800* :  possibly a spear.
*30:36.520- 30:41.200* :  The second is immediately in front of the pig with its head next to its snout.
*30:41.780- 30:46.660* :  It also seems to be holding a stick one end of which may be in contact with the pig's throat.
*30:47.380- 30:51.960* :  And the final figure seems to be upside down with its legs facing up and
*30:51.960- 30:52.960* :  split outwards.
*30:53.600- 30:57.680* :  It has one hand reaching towards and seemingly touching the pig's head.
*30:58.420- 31:03.780* :  Professor Maxima Behr of Griffiths University in Queensland says the discovery will change
*31:03.800- 31:05.700* :  the ideas of human evolution.
*31:06.440- 31:07.660* :  It's a complex scene.
*31:08.060- 31:12.840* :  We have a large animal in this case a pig and then you have human-like figures that are
*31:12.840- 31:18.560* :  playing with it so it is the all the citizens that shows that human at the time have the capacity
*31:19.220- 31:22.980* :  of thinking in abstract terms also and thinking in terms of storytelling.
*31:23.960- 31:27.020* :  Representational cave paintings have been found across the world.
*31:27.560- 31:32.720* :  The big question is whether that ability first emerged in Africa when modern humans evolved
*31:32.720- 31:37.180* :  and spread when our species left the continent 60,000 years ago
*31:37.740- 31:44.000* :  was emerged independently later as there became a greater social need for recorded communication.
*31:44.800- 31:47.640* :  That was Palab Goche and if you want to take a look at those paintings,
*31:48.220- 31:50.320* :  I will share a link on social media.
*31:52.000- 31:56.320* :  And that's it from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*31:56.700- 32:00.280* :  If you would like to comment on this edition or the topics covered in it,
*32:00.540- 32:01.620* :  do please send us an email.
