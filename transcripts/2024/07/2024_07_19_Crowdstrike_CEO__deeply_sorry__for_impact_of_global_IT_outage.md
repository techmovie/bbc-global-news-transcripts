*00:16.120- 00:16.860* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*00:30.740- 00:32.320* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*00:32.540- 00:37.900* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*00:38.000- 00:40.480* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.

*00:53.120- 00:56.140* :  It's time for the Olympics in Paris.
*00:56.800- 00:59.160* :  I'm Matt Rogers and I'm Bowen Yeigh.
*00:59.440- 01:01.180* :  And we're doing an Olympics podcast?
*01:01.480- 01:02.120* :  Uh, yeah.

*01:26.240- 01:29.620* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:31.700- 01:32.560* :  I'm Janet Jalille.
*01:32.560- 01:36.960* :  And in the early hours of Saturday, the 20th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:37.560- 01:43.620* :  The boss of the cyber security firm responsible for the global IT chaos apologizes and admits
*01:43.620- 01:46.720* :  it could be some time before the disruption ends.
*01:47.560- 01:53.880* :  The UN's top court rules that Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal.
*01:54.680- 01:59.080* :  The Biden administration says it's working every day to try to bring home the reporter,
*01:59.120- 02:05.060* :  Evan Gershkovich, who's been sentenced to 16 years in a Russian penal colony for spying.
*02:07.880- 02:11.640* :  Also in this podcast, I know nothing about martial art, nothing.
*02:12.340- 02:15.420* :  I just tried to do whatever King would tell me to do,
*02:15.700- 02:17.220* :  even how to move my eyes.
*02:17.820- 02:25.380* :  A trailblazer for women in Asian martial arts movies, Chang Pei Pei, has died at the age of 78.
*02:30.680- 02:36.540* :  Global computer systems in healthcare, banking, and airlines are slowly coming back online
*02:36.540- 02:40.480* :  after a digital outage disrupted networks in many countries.
*02:41.220- 02:44.280* :  Crowdstrike, the cyber security firm which caused the outage,
*02:44.560- 02:47.000* :  has said it's deeply sorry for the disruption.
*02:47.620- 02:52.920* :  The crisis was caused by a faulty software update which affected Microsoft Windows systems.
*02:53.580- 02:58.360* :  From Australia to the United States, plain and trained passengers were left stranded
*02:58.360- 03:02.600* :  with thousands of flights cancelled, TV stations were knocked off air,
*03:02.600- 03:07.760* :  shoppers left unable to make payments, and health services unable to access their records.
*03:08.480- 03:14.240* :  Even the Paris Olympics were affected as organizers were unable to issue summer creditations ahead of the games,
*03:14.240- 03:17.260* :  next week. Here's how events unfolded.
*03:17.720- 03:19.500* :  Thank you for conducting Crowdstrike's effort.
*03:20.220- 03:23.040* :  Crowdstrike is aware of reports of crashes on women.
*03:23.040- 03:28.100* :  Computer security company Crowdstrike has been linked to the outage that is affecting banks,
*03:28.540- 03:32.380* :  airports, supermarkets, and businesses across Australia and the world.
*03:32.620- 03:36.820* :  They're flight to encancelled, so there we try to find accommodation in Sydney.
*03:37.380- 03:40.260* :  Then we'll have to try and get a flight home somewhere, somewhere.
*03:40.500- 03:41.560* :  Now, how do flight to go?
*03:42.060- 03:45.860* :  They're saying that they have a pan-India system outage at the moment.
*03:45.860- 03:48.920* :  And right now, it's quite crowded out there.
*03:49.000- 03:50.560* :  Well, I am in the heart of Tokyo.
*03:50.560- 03:56.440* :  I am in Shibuya, and the budget airline JetStar Japan has been experiencing disruptions.
*03:56.440- 03:59.800* :  It's had to cancel dozens of its domestic flights.
*03:59.800- 04:02.160* :  Families here are also getting ready for those summer holidays.
*04:02.300- 04:04.420* :  Well, the city of London, the financial district,
*04:04.420- 04:08.520* :  and we have seen the knock on effects metro bank here in the UK.
*04:08.520- 04:09.740* :  They will suffer the effects.
*04:10.080- 04:12.580* :  They've been trading platforms that have suffered problems,
*04:12.580- 04:18.580* :  so trading in currencies has been disrupted, trading in oil, in gas, and other energy stocks.
*04:18.680- 04:20.080* :  Is it about three o'clock?
*04:20.220- 04:23.980* :  When suddenly all of our computer screens flashed blue,
*04:23.980- 04:26.500* :  the dreaded so-called screen of death.
*04:26.840- 04:29.800* :  And the media really does depend, particularly television.
*04:30.100- 04:34.280* :  The ABC has basically been broadcasting without the capacity to play tape.
*04:34.540- 04:37.840* :  It's essentially been being people talking non-stop on air,
*04:37.840- 04:40.060* :  trying to make it up as they go.
*04:40.300- 04:43.180* :  So look at the stories grabbing our attention right now.
*04:43.180- 04:46.500* :  A massive tech outage causes chaos.
*04:47.220- 04:49.920* :  Well, initially, many people had feared a cyber attack
*04:49.920- 04:51.960* :  was to blame for this huge outage,
*04:52.020- 04:54.520* :  but in fact, it was a relatively minor error
*04:54.920- 04:58.300* :  that caused what's been described as a digital pandemic.
*04:58.300- 05:01.040* :  Our technology editor, Zoe Klyman reports.
*05:01.740- 05:05.320* :  From Sydney to Amsterdam, the world woke up to chaos.
*05:05.320- 05:09.120* :  Screens in airports, hospitals, schools, train stations,
*05:09.540- 05:11.000* :  turned blue and stopped functioning.
*05:11.760- 05:15.760* :  And it was all because of a small software update to an antivirus tool
*05:16.140- 05:18.940* :  issued by the Cybersecurity Firm Crowdstrike.
*05:19.520- 05:23.640* :  The update reacted catastrophically with machines running Microsoft software
*05:24.040- 05:26.300* :  of which there were millions rendering them useless.
*05:26.800- 05:29.180* :  Apple and Linux users were unscathed.
*05:29.660- 05:32.780* :  Not a cyber attack or a hack, but an expensive mistake.
*05:32.780- 05:35.400* :  Crowdstrike's chief executive George Kurtz
*05:35.620- 05:38.600* :  speaking on NBC's Today Show in the US, apologized.
*05:39.240- 05:42.760* :  We're deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers,
*05:43.220- 05:45.340* :  to travelers, to anyone affected by this,
*05:45.500- 05:46.440* :  including our companies.
*05:46.440- 05:48.680* :  So we know what the issue is.
*05:48.960- 05:50.960* :  We're resolving and have resolved the issue now.
*05:50.960- 05:53.860* :  It's recovering that fix involves deleting a file
*05:53.860- 05:56.400* :  and doing a manual reboot in safe mode,
*05:56.400- 05:58.840* :  not so simple as switching it off and on again.
*05:58.840- 06:01.560* :  And Microsoft is warning that some people are reporting
*06:01.560- 06:03.520* :  having to do it 15 times.
*06:04.340- 06:06.420* :  There are big questions now for the tech join
*06:06.440- 06:09.340* :  as to how this update slipped through its own safety nets.
*06:09.860- 06:12.780* :  Many outages caused the tiniest of ripples before they're fixed,
*06:12.840- 06:14.120* :  but that's not the case here.
*06:14.560- 06:17.140* :  For IT teams, it's going to be a long weekend.
*06:18.060- 06:18.880* :  Zoe Kleinman.
*06:19.340- 06:23.560* :  So how could one faulty cybersecurity software update
*06:23.560- 06:26.420* :  cause so much havoc around the world?
*06:26.420- 06:31.400* :  A question, Celia Hatton, put to technology and AI expert Dan Sodegren.
*06:31.860- 06:33.900* :  This is the danger, of course, of monopolies.
*06:33.940- 06:36.500* :  And this is the danger of allowing too few companies,
*06:36.500- 06:38.260* :  you may say, having so much power.
*06:38.260- 06:40.620* :  And then you've, therefore, you've got this one point of failure.
*06:40.960- 06:43.420* :  We're actually quite lucky that there are multiple people
*06:43.420- 06:45.200* :  in the tech world and multiple companies.
*06:45.600- 06:48.720* :  And therefore, we're not all relying purely on Microsoft services
*06:49.020- 06:50.620* :  and around Azure Cloud, et cetera,
*06:50.620- 06:52.360* :  cause a lot more could have gone down.
*06:52.360- 06:54.680* :  And this is not in any way Microsoft bashing,
*06:54.680- 06:57.740* :  but it's most probably cost the world billions, maybe,
*06:58.100- 07:00.180* :  as a society, we've got to look at this and actually say,
*07:00.540- 07:03.760* :  it might be a bit dangerous just to have one company do all this.
*07:03.980- 07:06.260* :  Maybe we need a version of Microsoft in the UK
*07:06.260- 07:08.180* :  and maybe in a different place and different places.
*07:08.180- 07:10.680* :  We shouldn't just go, oh my goodness, this is all broke.
*07:11.140- 07:12.860* :  We should think, actually, what are the implications
*07:12.860- 07:14.420* :  to make sure this doesn't happen again?
*07:14.620- 07:19.300* :  So Dan, just briefly, what about the idea of cyber resilience?
*07:19.600- 07:21.700* :  Should major companies really be thinking more
*07:21.700- 07:22.920* :  about planning for the future?
*07:23.760- 07:24.860* :  Yeah, I think that's exactly it,
*07:24.860- 07:27.960* :  cause we now rely on these things almost entirely
*07:27.960- 07:29.000* :  for the future of work.
*07:29.260- 07:30.940* :  So I think the companies and governments
*07:31.000- 07:32.400* :  should be pushing on companies and saying,
*07:32.400- 07:35.180* :  actually, you should have more plan bs in place.
*07:35.180- 07:38.020* :  And maybe they shouldn't be so concerned about their share price.
*07:38.360- 07:40.480* :  You know, they should be thinking about society as a whole.
*07:40.480- 07:42.840* :  It's going to be interesting to see Microsoft share price.
*07:43.160- 07:44.600* :  But of course, the stock exchange went down.
*07:44.600- 07:46.560* :  So I don't even know if we can even check that.
*07:46.560- 07:47.960* :  So, one of those things, like,
*07:48.180- 07:49.620* :  and it's also from the insurance point of view,
*07:49.800- 07:52.640* :  this whole bsod, the old blue screen of death.
*07:52.720- 07:54.600* :  Is it an act of God or is it a bsod?
*07:54.880- 07:55.780* :  It's going to be fascinating.
*07:55.780- 07:58.300* :  And it's a couple of days to work out who pays for what?
*07:59.340- 08:00.220* :  Dan Sodergren.
*08:01.220- 08:03.080* :  The US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken,
*08:03.120- 08:06.140* :  has said the Biden administration is working every day
*08:06.200- 08:09.360* :  to try to bring home the jailed reporter, Evan Gershkovic,
*08:09.360- 08:12.000* :  along with other Americans detained in Russia.
*08:12.680- 08:15.860* :  Mr. Gershkovic was sentenced on Friday to 16 years
*08:16.160- 08:17.220* :  in a penal colony,
*08:17.540- 08:20.260* :  after a Russian court found him guilty of espionage.
*08:20.780- 08:23.300* :  The trial has been dismissed by his employer,
*08:23.300- 08:25.280* :  the Wall Street Journal, as a sham.
*08:25.900- 08:27.260* :  He's the first American journalist
*08:27.260- 08:30.300* :  to be convicted of spying by Russia since the Cold War.
*08:30.880- 08:32.680* :  Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg,
*08:33.100- 08:34.720* :  was in court in Yikaterinburg,
*08:35.040- 08:37.980* :  the city where Mr. Gershkovic was arrested last year.
*08:40.500- 08:42.700* :  The trial was behind closed doors.
*08:43.220- 08:45.260* :  For the verdict, we were allowed in.
*08:46.120- 08:48.020* :  But where was Evan Gershkovic?
*08:49.140- 08:50.560* :  Almost hidden from the cameras,
*08:51.140- 08:53.240* :  in the far corner of the glass cage,
*08:53.260- 08:55.760* :  that is the dock in a Russian courtroom.
*08:56.760- 08:58.280* :  He looked like he'd lost weight.
*09:00.580- 09:02.760* :  The judge found him guilty of spying.
*09:05.280- 09:07.380* :  And sentenced the Wall Street Journal reporter
*09:07.900- 09:11.120* :  to 16 years in a high security penal colony.
*09:12.180- 09:14.400* :  What just happened in this courtroom is unprecedented
*09:15.200- 09:16.280* :  in the history of modern Russia,
*09:16.640- 09:19.060* :  an American journalist convicted of espionage
*09:19.400- 09:21.880* :  in a trial that was held behind closed doors,
*09:22.500- 09:25.400* :  a trial that US officials have dismissed as a sham.
*09:26.160- 09:27.180* :  In a joint statement,
*09:27.180- 09:30.280* :  the Wall Street Journal's publisher and editor-in-chief
*09:30.640- 09:33.080* :  called it a disgraceful sham conviction.
*09:33.800- 09:36.300* :  They added, journalism is not a crime,
*09:36.840- 09:39.780* :  and we will not rest until Evan Gershkovic is released.
*09:41.660- 09:43.560* :  Evan was arrested at a stake house
*09:43.860- 09:46.060* :  on a reporting assignment in Yikaterinburg.
*09:46.460- 09:48.780* :  He was accused of collecting secret data
*09:48.960- 09:50.640* :  about a defense factory nearby.
*09:51.460- 09:55.720* :  His employer has accused Moscow of stockpiling American citizens
*09:55.720- 09:58.580* :  in Russian jails to trade them for Russians,
*09:59.080- 09:59.640* :  jailed abroad.
*10:01.760- 10:03.260* :  Is a prisoner swapped likely?
*10:04.080- 10:04.840* :  It's happened before.
*10:05.440- 10:10.260* :  In 2022, Russia freed US basketball star Brittany Griner.
*10:10.860- 10:12.460* :  She'd been jailed on a drugs charge.
*10:13.080- 10:17.000* :  In return, America released convicted Russian arms dealer,
*10:17.440- 10:18.160* :  Victor Boot.
*10:18.560- 10:19.840* :  As soon as I win the election,
*10:20.220- 10:21.600* :  I will have that reporter out.
*10:21.880- 10:23.680* :  Donald Trump promises big,
*10:24.660- 10:27.220* :  but the Biden administration is already in discussion
*10:27.240- 10:31.320* :  with Moscow about Evan and other Americans, jailed in Russia.
*10:32.080- 10:34.660* :  It's not clear, though, how close a deal is.
*10:36.320- 10:38.360* :  What is clear is that an American reporter
*10:38.360- 10:39.920* :  has been pronounced as spy
*10:39.920- 10:42.560* :  without any evidence having been made public.
*10:43.260- 10:45.000* :  Someone cries, we love you, Evan.
*10:47.020- 10:48.740* :  All he can do now is wait.
*10:50.540- 10:52.400* :  That report by Steve Rosenberg.
*10:52.980- 10:56.260* :  Well, Anton Trojnozky is a New York Times Moscow Bureau
*10:56.260- 10:58.480* :  chief and knows Evan Gershkovich well.
*10:59.100- 11:00.420* :  Speaking to Mary Mushuri,
*11:00.420- 11:02.380* :  he gave his reaction to the sentencing.
*11:03.040- 11:05.840* :  On the one hand, this was completely expected.
*11:05.900- 11:10.320* :  We knew these types of trials in Russia pretty much always
*11:10.480- 11:11.520* :  and in a guilty verdict.
*11:11.520- 11:15.960* :  And we knew he was going to get close to the maximum
*11:15.960- 11:18.860* :  of 20 years in prison that he was facing.
*11:19.960- 11:21.180* :  So it was very much expected.
*11:21.180- 11:23.380* :  But then if you pause to think about it,
*11:23.380- 11:26.720* :  it's really such a travesty and such an assault
*11:27.300- 11:30.400* :  on press freedom and on journalism.
*11:31.220- 11:32.780* :  And even just on common sense,
*11:32.780- 11:36.120* :  because it's so clear that Evan was simply doing his job
*11:36.660- 11:39.800* :  when he was working in Russia and arrested last year.
*11:40.160- 11:40.720* :  How is he?
*11:41.560- 11:45.860* :  Well, it's possible to exchange letters with him,
*11:46.220- 11:49.560* :  which I have done over the last year
*11:49.620- 11:51.160* :  plus since his arrest.
*11:51.220- 11:55.520* :  And I can say that he's been incredibly strong.
*11:55.520- 11:58.200* :  I think he understands, has understood
*11:58.200- 12:02.200* :  throughout this process what a serious situation this is.
*12:02.780- 12:04.180* :  But he's kept his hopes up.
*12:04.180- 12:05.420* :  He's kept his spirits up.
*12:05.460- 12:09.780* :  He's kept the spirits up of those close to him
*12:10.140- 12:12.800* :  on the outside who are so worried about him.
*12:13.440- 12:16.220* :  We can only hope at this point that sometimes soon
*12:16.220- 12:19.040* :  this terrible ordeal will come to an end.
*12:19.040- 12:22.080* :  But we can really only speculate about that right now.
*12:22.180- 12:24.920* :  It is speculation, but is there, do you think,
*12:24.920- 12:26.720* :  some hope amongst his friends and supporters
*12:26.720- 12:28.200* :  that could be some sort of deal?
*12:28.880- 12:31.500* :  That's the most realistic way, unfortunately,
*12:31.540- 12:35.860* :  that Evan can get out of prison is through
*12:36.180- 12:37.400* :  some sort of prison or swap.
*12:37.400- 12:40.520* :  But that's how Vladimir Putin and the Russian government
*12:41.160- 12:43.140* :  have operated in recent years
*12:43.840- 12:46.020* :  in terms of other imprisoned Americans.
*12:46.860- 12:49.740* :  At the same time, you know, he should not be in prison.
*12:49.740- 12:51.560* :  He is completely innocent.
*12:51.560- 12:53.780* :  He was just doing his job.
*12:55.380- 12:57.380* :  Anton Tchaunovsky of the New York Times
*12:57.380- 13:00.620* :  and friend of the jailed Wall Street Journal reporter,
*13:00.840- 13:01.940* :  Ivan Gershkovich.
*13:03.020- 13:05.880* :  A Chinese film star who pioneered martial arts roles
*13:05.880- 13:07.480* :  for women and starred in the film,
*13:07.480- 13:11.700* :  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, has died at the age of 78.
*13:12.540- 13:14.320* :  Chang Pei Pei had been suffering
*13:14.320- 13:16.420* :  from a degenerative brain disease.
*13:16.760- 13:17.860* :  Mahibir Sto reports.
*13:22.460- 13:25.320* :  Chang Pei Pei's breakthrough film was come drink with me.
*13:25.780- 13:29.900* :  In 1966, she played a young woman called Golden Swallow,
*13:30.480- 13:33.000* :  who used her kung fu skills to free her brother,
*13:33.500- 13:35.100* :  who'd been kidnapped by bandits.
*13:35.780- 13:36.840* :  Similar roles followed.
*13:37.580- 13:40.180* :  Later on, she admitted she knew nothing of martial arts
*13:40.180- 13:42.080* :  before she began her film career.
*13:42.640- 13:44.660* :  Although it didn't seem to matter to audiences.
*13:45.000- 13:48.960* :  I was so young and I know nothing about martial arts, nothing.
*13:49.720- 13:54.060* :  So I just tried to do whatever King would tell me to do,
*13:54.380- 13:56.300* :  even how to move my eyes.
*13:56.720- 13:58.640* :  Chang Pei Pei was born in Shanghai.
*13:59.400- 14:02.380* :  She grew up during a chaotic period in China's history,
*14:02.860- 14:04.540* :  just as the communist took over.
*14:05.100- 14:07.240* :  In the early 60s, she moved to Hong Kong
*14:07.660- 14:08.660* :  and started acting.
*14:09.400- 14:11.380* :  Later, after her initial success,
*14:11.960- 14:13.480* :  she went to live in the United States
*14:13.480- 14:15.880* :  and had a brief period away from the movies.
*14:17.000- 14:19.060* :  Her career picked up a game when she starred
*14:19.060- 14:22.160* :  in the Oscar-winning film Crouch Integer, Hidden Dragon.
*14:24.760- 14:27.200* :  It attracted a new more international audience
*14:27.220- 14:28.360* :  to kung fu movies.
*14:29.040- 14:32.280* :  The film's star was a young woman skilled in martial arts,
*14:32.840- 14:36.020* :  a kind of rule that had been pioneered many years before
*14:36.560- 14:37.940* :  by Chang Pei Pei.
*14:39.140- 14:41.520* :  Mickey Bristo, looking back on the life and career
*14:41.980- 14:44.400* :  of the Chinese film star, Chang Pei Pei,
*14:44.440- 14:46.540* :  who's died at the age of 78.
*14:50.200- 14:51.240* :  Still to come on this podcast?
*14:51.260- 14:53.600* :  We make the magic that people pay for,
*14:53.600- 14:56.700* :  but we don't get anything for it.
*14:56.700- 14:57.540* :  We're magic makers.
*14:57.620- 14:58.960* :  Mickey would want fair pay.
*14:59.820- 15:02.160* :  Unhappiness amongst workers at Disneyland,
*15:02.160- 15:05.420* :  the self-proclaimed, happiest place on Earth.
*15:13.160- 15:16.120* :  Ryan Reynolds here for, I guess, my hundreds mid commercial.
*15:16.640- 15:17.480* :  No, no, no, no, no.
*15:17.620- 15:18.260* :  No, no.
*15:19.400- 15:20.720* :  Honestly, when I started this, I thought
*15:20.720- 15:22.040* :  I'd only have to do four of these.
*15:22.260- 15:25.540* :  It's unlimited, premium, wireless for $15 a month.
*15:25.620- 15:28.580* :  How are there still people paying two or three times that much?
*15:29.140- 15:30.620* :  I'm sorry, I shouldn't be victim blaming here.
*15:30.980- 15:35.360* :  Give it a try at midmobile.com slash switch, whatever you're

*15:38.260- 15:39.800* :  new customers on first three month plan only,
*15:39.800- 15:40.780* :  taxes and fees extra,
*15:40.900- 15:42.660* :  speed slower, about 40 gigabyte, the seat details.
*15:42.660- 15:46.320* :  Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
*15:47.400- 15:49.600* :  We all know what that music means.
*15:49.600- 15:52.600* :  It's time for the Olympics in Paris.
*15:53.260- 15:55.640* :  I'm Matt Rogers, and I'm Bowen Yeung.

*16:11.360- 16:12.780* :  on the I Heart Radio app.
*16:13.220- 16:16.180* :  And listen to two guys, five rings on the I Heart Radio app,
*16:16.360- 16:18.620* :  Apple Podcast, or wherever you get your podcasts.
*16:25.760- 16:27.600* :  You're listening to the Global News podcast.
*16:28.200- 16:30.460* :  The UN's top court has said that Israel's
*16:30.460- 16:34.540* :  decades-long occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal,
*16:35.020- 16:36.760* :  and needs to end as soon as possible.
*16:37.260- 16:39.700* :  The International Court of Justice, or ICJ,
*16:39.700- 16:42.320* :  called on Israel to stop settlement activity
*16:42.320- 16:44.060* :  in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
*16:44.820- 16:47.540* :  This comes amid mounting international concern
*16:47.540- 16:51.000* :  over the huge death toll and destruction in Gaza
*16:51.540- 16:55.160* :  as the Israeli military wages a campaign to destroy Hamas.
*16:55.680- 16:57.880* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*16:57.880- 17:00.460* :  condemned the court's decision as lies.
*17:01.200- 17:02.780* :  But the Palestinian foreign minister,
*17:02.780- 17:06.460* :  Riyadh Al-Maliki, told reporters he welcomed it
*17:06.460- 17:08.020* :  as a watershed moment.
*17:08.700- 17:12.440* :  This ruling couldn't be more timely or solely needed.
*17:13.400- 17:15.260* :  The Palestinian people have endured
*17:15.260- 17:18.240* :  unbearable suffering and injustice for decades.
*17:19.420- 17:23.420* :  Israel's colonial, expansionist, and genocidal policies
*17:23.420- 17:27.820* :  are on full horrific display before the world.
*17:28.940- 17:31.100* :  The Palestinian people are confronting
*17:31.100- 17:34.360* :  a ferocious genocide and defending
*17:34.360- 17:36.680* :  where very right to exist and live.
*17:37.780- 17:39.560* :  A security correspondent, Frank Gardner,
*17:39.560- 17:40.880* :  tell me more about the ruling.
*17:41.640- 17:43.600* :  On paper, this is pretty significant.
*17:43.600- 17:46.000* :  It's an absolutely damning indictment
*17:46.000- 17:49.040* :  by the world's highest court of Israel's policies
*17:49.040- 17:51.980* :  and practices towards Palestinians in the territories
*17:51.980- 17:55.960* :  that Israel conquered in 1967, i.e. the West Bank,
*17:55.960- 17:58.120* :  as we call it, Judea and Samaria,
*17:58.120- 18:00.960* :  as some Israelis call it, and East Jerusalem,
*18:00.960- 18:04.540* :  which the Palestinians would like to have as their future capital.
*18:05.320- 18:07.980* :  And the ruling, which is non-binding,
*18:07.980- 18:13.220* :  I mean, this is an advisory ruling by a panel of 15 judges
*18:13.220- 18:15.700* :  that has examined evidence over the last 18 months,
*18:16.540- 18:19.740* :  is that those Israeli policies and practices
*18:20.380- 18:21.940* :  are in breach of international law.
*18:22.640- 18:25.800* :  The presence of Israel in the occupied territories is illegal.
*18:26.260- 18:28.760* :  It must end that occupation as early as possible.
*18:29.360- 18:31.900* :  And it must cease all new settlement activity.
*18:32.880- 18:34.740* :  It's been very quickly rejected by Israel,
*18:34.740- 18:37.640* :  not surprisingly, a pretty angry rejection,
*18:38.300- 18:40.960* :  calling it blatant lies and propaganda.
*18:42.500- 18:44.280* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*18:44.280- 18:47.240* :  has said the Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land,
*18:47.800- 18:49.640* :  including in our eternal capital to Jerusalem,
*18:49.640- 18:52.900* :  nor in Judea and Samaria, our historical homeland.
*18:52.900- 18:55.460* :  Those are the words that they use for the West Bank.
*18:56.260- 18:58.380* :  But I think what this does show, and, okay,
*18:58.380- 19:00.840* :  first of all, let's just explain what it is not.
*19:01.400- 19:04.260* :  This is nothing to do with the Gaza war directly.
*19:04.260- 19:05.260* :  The Gaza conflict.
*19:05.840- 19:09.520* :  This is about the territories that Israel is occupying,
*19:10.120- 19:12.900* :  seemingly permanently, and not in the occupying,
*19:12.900- 19:14.920* :  but colonizing, building settlements there.
*19:15.520- 19:19.920* :  There are now 700,000 Jewish settlers living in occupied,
*19:19.920- 19:22.460* :  well, territory that most of the world considers
*19:22.460- 19:24.100* :  to be occupied territory.
*19:24.780- 19:27.360* :  Israel considers it can't possibly be an occupation
*19:27.360- 19:28.200* :  because it's our land.
*19:28.200- 19:29.880* :  You can't be occupiers in your own land,
*19:29.880- 19:31.200* :  it's Netanyahu's view.
*19:31.880- 19:33.700* :  So it's non-binding.
*19:33.740- 19:35.980* :  And even if it were legally binding,
*19:35.980- 19:37.480* :  I think Israel would ignore it
*19:37.480- 19:40.200* :  because it has already ignored findings
*19:40.200- 19:43.420* :  by the same court, the ICJ, the International Court of Justice,
*19:44.100- 19:45.820* :  that came out earlier this year.
*19:46.400- 19:49.940* :  But I think what it does show is how diplomatically isolated,
*19:49.940- 19:52.600* :  not any Israelis, but also in the United States,
*19:52.600- 19:54.560* :  it's primary backer on this.
*19:54.780- 19:58.000* :  The world is not on Israel's side on this one.
*19:58.860- 19:59.560* :  Frank Gardner.
*20:00.300- 20:01.620* :  Next, let's go to Bangladesh.
*20:08.080- 20:10.720* :  Where after another day of more violent clashes
*20:10.720- 20:14.280* :  between police and demonstrators and the storming of a prison
*20:14.320- 20:16.280* :  in which hundreds of inmates were freed,
*20:16.280- 20:20.100* :  the government has now ordered a nationwide curfew
*20:20.360- 20:21.980* :  and called in the army to help.
*20:22.540- 20:23.920* :  The unrest began on Tuesday
*20:23.920- 20:26.880* :  after a controversial government job quota system
*20:26.880- 20:29.700* :  angered students who said it favoured supporters
*20:29.700- 20:33.140* :  of the country's authoritarian ruler, Shake Hacena.
*20:33.800- 20:37.300* :  The BBC Bengali service has at least 67 people
*20:37.300- 20:40.480* :  have been killed in the past few days of violence.
*20:41.360- 20:43.260* :  Internet, mobile and phone services
*20:43.260- 20:45.260* :  have now been mostly shut down.
*20:46.180- 20:48.920* :  Amitabha Bhattasali from the BBC Bengali service
*20:48.920- 20:50.280* :  is monitoring the situation
*20:50.320- 20:52.920* :  from neighbouring India in Calcutta.
*20:53.500- 20:55.680* :  BBC got a confirmation from the Prime Minister,
*20:55.680- 20:59.280* :  Shake Hacena's office that army is being deployed
*20:59.280- 21:02.400* :  and a coffee who has been imposed all across the country.
*21:02.600- 21:05.120* :  And the decision was taken at a meeting,
*21:05.120- 21:07.700* :  at a late night meeting of the ruling alliance
*21:07.700- 21:09.320* :  that's a 14-party alliance.
*21:09.880- 21:12.620* :  And other in this regard will be issued shortly.
*21:12.620- 21:15.480* :  That's what our colleagues in Dhaka has informed us.
*21:15.880- 21:17.700* :  Prior to this throughout the day,
*21:17.700- 21:21.320* :  there have been numerous clashes and incidents of violence
*21:21.320- 21:23.160* :  and arsoning throughout the country,
*21:23.560- 21:26.920* :  particularly in several places in Dhaka city.
*21:27.460- 21:31.240* :  And the death toll has been increasing since late afternoon.
*21:31.840- 21:35.260* :  And in one of the areas in the Dhaka city,
*21:35.700- 21:37.740* :  where at least 10 people have died,
*21:37.740- 21:40.580* :  and the hospital authorities are telling our colleagues
*21:40.580- 21:43.320* :  that most of them had gunshot injuries
*21:43.620- 21:45.080* :  and in the same hospital.
*21:45.520- 21:48.820* :  Right now, there are around 300 others are being treated
*21:48.820- 21:51.260* :  and most of them are shot.
*21:51.280- 21:53.700* :  And the incident you are just mentioning
*21:54.300- 21:56.700* :  about the prison break that has happened
*21:56.700- 21:58.200* :  in nursing the district.
*21:58.560- 22:01.260* :  Several eyewitnesses have confirmed to our colleagues
*22:01.260- 22:05.020* :  in Dhaka that huge crowd of demonstrators,
*22:05.460- 22:08.180* :  they had just barged into the prison.
*22:08.500- 22:11.900* :  The prison guards lost control over it.
*22:11.900- 22:14.780* :  And several hundred prisoners had been freed
*22:14.780- 22:16.480* :  by those demonstrators.
*22:17.120- 22:21.300* :  And this was more or less the picture
*22:22.120- 22:24.580* :  of what we could gather from our colleagues in Dhaka.
*22:25.720- 22:27.060* :  It's very difficult, isn't it,
*22:27.260- 22:28.820* :  for you to gather information right now
*22:28.820- 22:31.720* :  because services have been shut down
*22:31.720- 22:34.040* :  such as internet, mobile phone.
*22:34.040- 22:35.520* :  How are you able to do this?
*22:35.520- 22:38.760* :  And do we know why these students storm this prison?
*22:39.720- 22:44.840* :  This internet shutdown has started a little over 24 hours now
*22:45.760- 22:48.720* :  and since then, the BBC colleagues are using
*22:48.720- 22:51.540* :  a very, very feeble internet connection.
*22:52.000- 22:54.560* :  They are losing the connection intermittently
*22:54.700- 22:56.740* :  and for one and a half hours,
*22:56.740- 23:00.540* :  we are unable to get any updates from them.
*23:00.900- 23:05.060* :  And they are updating us so that we can take it
*23:05.060- 23:08.660* :  to our readers and listeners throughout the world.
*23:09.860- 23:13.140* :  Amitabha Bhattasali from the BBC Bengali Service.
*23:14.780- 23:17.740* :  Disneyland claims to be the happiest place on earth
*23:17.920- 23:19.260* :  but for those that work there,
*23:19.500- 23:20.800* :  some might well disagree.
*23:21.540- 23:24.000* :  Talks between the company and thousands of employees
*23:24.000- 23:26.580* :  are growing increasingly acrimonious.
*23:27.200- 23:28.500* :  As we record this podcast,
*23:28.500- 23:30.420* :  Disneyland workers are in the process
*23:30.420- 23:32.960* :  of voting on whether to authorize a strike.
*23:33.480- 23:36.140* :  They want higher wages and improved working conditions
*23:36.780- 23:39.420* :  and many say they can't even afford to live
*23:39.800- 23:41.280* :  in the expensive neighbourhoods
*23:41.300- 23:43.320* :  near the theme park in Southern California.
*23:44.160- 23:45.920* :  The BBC's Reagan Morris reports
*23:45.920- 23:48.720* :  from the home of the Disneyland Resort, Anaheim.
*23:49.300- 23:53.680* :  We make the money, we make the money, we make the money.
*23:53.680- 23:55.120* :  We make the money.
*23:55.460- 23:58.220* :  I'm outside Disneyland in Anaheim, California
*23:58.520- 24:00.980* :  where things are becoming increasingly heated
*24:01.260- 24:03.460* :  between management and Disney workers.
*24:04.100- 24:06.080* :  The Disneyland cast members
*24:06.320- 24:08.300* :  and if you work for Disney, you're a cast member,
*24:08.300- 24:13.100* :  whether you're a princess, a pirate, chef or a janitor.
*24:13.600- 24:15.040* :  And the cast members, I'm spoken to,
*24:15.040- 24:18.660* :  said they make the magic and the executives make the money.
*24:19.880- 24:21.540* :  It makes me wonder, why don't you
*24:21.540- 24:23.520* :  want to recognize me because I'm making you that money?
*24:24.460- 24:28.880* :  I am making that money so that you can buy that sports team now
*24:29.840- 24:31.260* :  and I'm struggling to pay my bills.
*24:31.460- 24:34.000* :  Calling Palmer is one of the union negotiators
*24:34.000- 24:36.280* :  pushing for a better contract with Disneyland
*24:36.420- 24:39.820* :  where she has worked for nearly 37 years.
*24:41.020- 24:42.900* :  She makes almost $24 an hour
*24:42.900- 24:45.560* :  as a merchandise hostess in New Orleans Square.
*24:45.560- 24:50.500* :  Just recognize us, just give us our fair share, give us,
*24:50.720- 24:54.220* :  give us an award, but they don't want to do it.
*24:55.020- 24:55.740* :  And that's why we're here.
*24:56.640- 24:59.120* :  The first woman I met when I showed up here today
*24:59.580- 25:00.780* :  had experienced homelessness.
*25:00.820- 25:04.560* :  And then I met another woman who's experiencing homelessness.
*25:04.560- 25:06.840* :  Is that, I guess, it's not unusual?
*25:07.060- 25:07.740* :  It is not unusual.
*25:07.940- 25:12.400* :  We don't get it, we don't get it, we don't get it.
*25:12.780- 25:15.540* :  Disney brands itself is the happiest place on Earth.
*25:15.900- 25:19.020* :  But union officials say about one in 10 Disney cast members
*25:19.460- 25:22.160* :  have experienced homelessness while working at the park.
*25:22.620- 25:24.560* :  I make a little over $20 an hour.
*25:25.040- 25:28.140* :  And the company's not really offering us much.
*25:28.660- 25:30.220* :  I cannot live off of that.
*25:30.800- 25:33.800* :  Last summer, I was living in my car with my dogs.
*25:33.800- 25:38.140* :  And that's not something that anybody should experience
*25:38.140- 25:40.880* :  working a full-time job for a company like Disney.
*25:41.440- 25:44.520* :  Cynthia Caranza works overnight shifts at Disneyland
*25:44.520- 25:47.920* :  in floor care, cleaning, carpeting, and repairs.
*25:48.820- 25:51.140* :  At one stage, she was working three jobs,
*25:51.560- 25:52.760* :  all while living in her car.
*25:52.880- 25:56.360* :  There was times when I questioned what I was doing here.
*25:57.080- 25:59.200* :  And how I was going to get back on my feet.
*25:59.880- 26:03.000* :  And my dogs were there for me all the time.
*26:03.140- 26:03.960* :  That's all I had.
*26:04.760- 26:08.560* :  I threw myself into work because my goal was to get back
*26:08.560- 26:09.260* :  on my feet.
*26:10.080- 26:13.240* :  There's no reason anybody should ever experience that.
*26:13.560- 26:15.360* :  I had to shower on the property.
*26:15.960- 26:17.720* :  I had to go to the costuming building
*26:18.380- 26:20.220* :  before my shift and shower there.
*26:20.480- 26:24.000* :  There was times when I didn't know where I was going to sleep
*26:24.000- 26:25.080* :  because it's summertime.
*26:25.260- 26:28.280* :  And working third shift and sleeping during the day
*26:28.700- 26:29.920* :  is hard to find shade.
*26:30.420- 26:33.000* :  For me, as a female, it's hard to find a safe spot.
*26:33.700- 26:34.300* :  We make magic.
*26:34.920- 26:36.680* :  We make the magic that people pay for,
*26:36.680- 26:39.780* :  but we don't get anything for it.
*26:39.780- 26:40.640* :  We're magic makers.
*26:40.640- 26:42.040* :  Mickey would want fair pay.
*26:42.720- 26:45.880* :  In a statement, Disney said that they respect and value
*26:45.880- 26:49.260* :  our cast members and recognize the important role
*26:49.260- 26:51.740* :  they play in creating happiness for our guests.
*26:52.420- 26:54.860* :  The company said it's committed to reaching a deal
*26:55.280- 26:58.600* :  that focuses on what matters most to our current cast members,
*26:59.220- 27:02.140* :  helps us attract new cast and positions Disneyland
*27:02.140- 27:05.120* :  Resort for growth and the creation of more jobs.
*27:05.840- 27:14.220* :  When you wish upon a star, make all your friends who you are.
*27:15.080- 27:18.400* :  Disneyland is known as a place where dreams come true.
*27:19.440- 27:21.960* :  As contract talks are set to resume next week,
*27:21.960- 27:24.120* :  the workers hope that's true.
*27:25.640- 27:32.740* :  If your heart is in your dream, your request is true.
*27:33.800- 27:36.040* :  That report by Reagan Morris.
*27:38.560- 27:42.100* :  Now, let's end this podcast in Munich in the south of Germany.
*27:42.100- 27:45.220* :  The city is probably best known for October Fest
*27:45.600- 27:48.860* :  and annual beer festival where the average beer consumption
*27:48.860- 27:53.720* :  is a whopping 6.9 million litres each year.
*27:54.360- 27:55.920* :  When you walk through the streets of the city,
*27:55.940- 27:58.100* :  you won't be able to miss the many beer gardens,
*27:58.680- 28:01.900* :  outdoor areas where they serve beer and traditional foods.
*28:02.540- 28:05.460* :  But now, there's a new one amongst them with a difference.
*28:05.460- 28:07.900* :  It doesn't sell any alcohol.
*28:08.680- 28:11.600* :  Catherine Björhanger has been speaking to one of the people
*28:11.600- 28:15.120* :  behind the Null Bay Garden, Florian Shenhofer.
*28:15.720- 28:18.220* :  Yeah, I'm in the alcohol business for years now,
*28:18.580- 28:22.200* :  and you know, we got a little problem with public drinking
*28:22.200- 28:27.660* :  like in many places after the Corona virus.
*28:28.200- 28:32.260* :  And so right now, there is a big scene of drinking on the street.
*28:33.020- 28:36.260* :  And we had the idea to change that thing a little
*28:37.120- 28:41.600* :  and to change how people think about drinking in public.
*28:42.060- 28:43.980* :  And not to be facetious about it.
*28:44.420- 28:48.300* :  Of course, you know, it's important to have non-alcoholic options.
*28:48.980- 28:52.920* :  But I imagine in a culture where beer alcohol is so important
*28:52.920- 28:56.440* :  to people in Munich, how have people been reacting to your business?
*28:57.060- 28:59.760* :  Yeah, so there's a lot of good tension
*29:00.360- 29:04.240* :  and the consumption is sinking for years right now.
*29:04.740- 29:09.700* :  And one of our major breweries in Munich is doing alcohol-free beer
*29:09.700- 29:12.600* :  right now, and it's running so good,
*29:12.600- 29:17.540* :  so they don't do enough beer for the consumption right now.
*29:18.080- 29:20.760* :  It's still a beer garden, but it's without alcohol.
*29:21.000- 29:23.560* :  And how much of a culture change do you think that would be
*29:23.560- 29:27.120* :  in Germany to see more zero alcohol options?
*29:28.000- 29:30.580* :  Yeah, the last two, three, four years.
*29:31.240- 29:34.940* :  There's a lot more alcohol-free beverages.
*29:35.820- 29:38.020* :  Even in my business and I do a lot of alcohol,
*29:38.620- 29:40.840* :  people ask for more options.
*29:41.560- 29:44.600* :  You know, you can have fun without alcohol.
*29:44.900- 29:46.740* :  And Florian, before we let you go,
*29:46.740- 29:48.760* :  we just tell us how does the beer taste, though?
*29:50.360- 29:51.560* :  Different, really different.
*29:51.560- 29:54.040* :  So we've got in a good way or in a bad way.
*29:54.320- 29:55.640* :  Different could meet a lot of noise.
*29:57.520- 30:02.380* :  In a really good way, because they changed how they do this.
*30:03.060- 30:05.560* :  A couple of years ago, they took the alcohol off.
*30:06.060- 30:06.780* :  It was a yak beer.
*30:07.240- 30:10.620* :  And now you have three or four different beers
*30:10.620- 30:11.520* :  with different tastes.
*30:11.900- 30:13.980* :  It's more like the craft idea.
*30:14.540- 30:16.440* :  And the taste is really interesting.
*30:16.440- 30:17.740* :  It's not just different.
*30:18.420- 30:19.680* :  It's really good.
*30:20.920- 30:23.160* :  Florian Scherne-Huther, talking about the merits
*30:23.160- 30:24.580* :  of alcohol-free beer.
*30:26.240- 30:27.640* :  And that's all from us for now,
*30:27.640- 30:31.460* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*30:31.740- 30:34.380* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered,

*31:05.440- 31:07.640* :  We all know what that music means.
*31:07.780- 31:10.660* :  It's time for the Olympics in Paris.
*31:11.320- 31:13.460* :  I'm Matt Rogers and I'm Bowen Yang.
