*01:34.260- 01:39.720* :  I'm Bernadette Kioh and in the early hours of Sunday the 7th of July these are our main stories.
*01:39.820- 01:45.440* :  The surprise winner of Iran's presidential election the reformist Masoud Pazeshkian
*01:45.440- 01:49.540* :  has told supporters their votes have given hope to a dissatisfied society.
*01:50.240- 01:53.580* :  We ask what his victory might mean for relations with the West.
*01:54.560- 02:01.080* :  Hamas says a strike on a UN run school in Gaza has killed at least 16 people. Israel says it was
*02:01.080- 02:09.340* :  used by Hamas operatives. Also in this podcast a 5th democratic member of Congress has called on
*02:09.340- 02:15.280* :  Joe Biden to withdraw from the US presidential race and there's nervousness in France ahead of
*02:15.280- 02:20.900* :  Sunday's second round vote that could bring in a far right government. As a black person in
*02:20.900- 02:25.980* :  France I am absolutely revolted and disgusted by what's going on right now. Our mainstream
*02:25.980- 02:32.180* :  medias are saying nothing about the racist attacks that are now taking place daily.
*02:37.240- 02:38.280* :  We start in Iran.
*02:44.220- 02:49.940* :  Where a jubilant crowd in Tehran greeted the newly elected president Masoud Pazeshkian
*02:50.360- 02:54.360* :  who gave a short address at the shrine of the founder of the Iranian Revolution.
*02:54.840- 03:01.020* :  Despite a relatively low turnout in Friday's election runoff the so-called reformist candidate
*03:01.420- 03:07.040* :  finished comfortably ahead of his hard-line conservative rival. These were reactions of some
*03:15.180- 03:19.380* :  Iranians. I just hope the new government will do something to bring down inflation.
*03:19.740- 03:26.420* :  Also they must help with youth unemployment but overall happy Masoud Pazeshkian won and he must
*03:26.420- 03:30.260* :  have sought the morality police harassing women on a daily basis.
*03:32.940- 03:37.960* :  I have a positive feeling about Pazeshkian for now. He made many promises and must fulfill them.
*03:38.480- 03:42.800* :  He's in favor of talks with the worst and likely sanctions will be lifted and that's good news for us.
*03:43.660- 03:49.780* :  But not everyone was celebrating. Freelance journalist Faresh Tessadeegi described the mood
*03:49.780- 03:56.100* :  in Tehran. People in Iran generally have become depoleticized. When you become depoleticized it shows
*03:56.100- 04:02.420* :  itself first in the election. People don't go and don't vote because they feel that there is no change.
*04:02.460- 04:07.240* :  There is no need to change anything because it is as it is. There were some
*04:07.240- 04:12.500* :  moods of celebrations last night around three or four in the morning also in Tehran.
*04:12.500- 04:18.640* :  But you know the numbers vary in hundreds not even thousands. Conservative households they were
*04:18.640- 04:23.900* :  upset. They were totally upset because the majority of them had voted for Mr. Jelly Lee. They felt
*04:23.900- 04:31.180* :  upset. They felt disappointed. C. Avash Ardalan from BBC Persian told me what we'd heard so far
*04:31.180- 04:37.280* :  from the new presidents. Not very much. He was scheduled to hold a press conference but the press
*04:37.280- 04:42.480* :  conference was cancelled. We understand the reason was that he had a private meeting with a
*04:42.480- 04:48.260* :  supreme leader. But then he went to the shrine of the founder of the revolution and amid scenes
*04:48.260- 04:54.560* :  of chaos he delivered a brief address. It was not worthy that he said had it not been for the
*04:54.560- 05:01.280* :  supreme leader which he thanked that his name would have not come out of the ballot box perhaps
*05:01.280- 05:10.120* :  hinting at the impression that his semi-anti-establishment candidate and that the hardliners would not
*05:10.120- 05:16.740* :  swallow his presidency so easily. How much freedom will he have to operate given that state policy
*05:16.740- 05:23.700* :  is decided by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Hamani? Well if he can build consensus if he can
*05:23.700- 05:29.140* :  convince the supreme leader to get on board with his policies then he can pull it off. As was the case
*05:29.140- 05:35.600* :  back in 2015 where you had a moderate president Hassan Rouhani which back then with the backing of
*05:35.600- 05:43.260* :  the supreme leader managed to strike a nuclear deal with the West only to have a Donald Trump presidency
*05:43.260- 05:50.240* :  withdraw from that deal thereby confirming the misgivings and suspicions of the supreme leader.
*05:50.540- 05:54.860* :  It will be more difficult to get him on board this time but given the crippling effect of US
*05:54.860- 06:01.940* :  economic sanctions it might be easy as well. What is the mood in Iran with the election of a new
*06:01.940- 06:07.580* :  president? It really depends on who you're talking to. A voter turnout was 50 percent this time
*06:07.580- 06:13.580* :  10 percent more than the first round of voting last week which means that a lot more Iranians
*06:13.580- 06:19.660* :  turned out to vote at the fear of the possibility that a hardliner might become president. However
*06:19.660- 06:25.620* :  still half of the people who could vote did not vote. Some are speaking of the revival of a
*06:25.620- 06:31.420* :  reformist movement and some were bitterly opposed to the regime and are dissatisfied believe that
*06:31.420- 06:36.240* :  there's no difference between any of the politicians that emerge from this clerical establishment.
*06:36.240- 06:42.300* :  C. Avash Adelun as we've been hearing the election came amid domestic discontent
*06:42.300- 06:48.380* :  over the state of Iran's sanctioned hit economy and the dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear
*06:48.380- 06:55.040* :  program in which a change of US president could make a new deal impossible. Owen Bennett Jones has
*06:55.040- 07:01.440* :  been speaking to Kelsey Davinport who's director for non-proliferation policy at the Arms Control
*07:02.320- 07:07.340* :  Association. How does she think policy makers in Washington might respond to the election of
*07:07.340- 07:14.140* :  reformist president in Iran? The Biden administration should try to take advantage of this narrow window
*07:14.820- 07:19.860* :  between you know, Pajashkin coming into office and the US presidential election to try to reduce
*07:20.560- 07:26.460* :  nuclear risk. So there may be some spaces around the edges to reduce tension and reduce the
*07:26.460- 07:30.960* :  proliferation risk posed by Iran's nuclear program, but you know, we shouldn't expect
*07:30.960- 07:36.160* :  you know, significant changes or any movement towards negotiations on a comprehensive deal until
*07:36.160- 07:41.020* :  after the US presidential election. When you talk about a comprehensive dealing, isn't the time
*07:41.020- 07:46.140* :  for that past because Iran must be very close now to having a bomb if it doesn't already have one.
*07:46.380- 07:51.560* :  Iran is on the threshold of nuclear weapons. So if the political decision was made to develop a
*07:51.560- 07:57.460* :  bomb, you know, Tehran could move very quickly to produce enough nuclear material to actually
*07:57.460- 08:03.920* :  build a weapon. But US intelligence continues to assess that Iran is not actually taking those
*08:03.920- 08:10.720* :  steps. And one thing that I think is important in Pajashkin's campaigning, he talked about
*08:11.180- 08:17.180* :  wanting to re-engage the West. He talked about wanting to re-engage on the nuclear program.
*08:17.600- 08:23.760* :  Now, the 2015 nuclear deal is dead. Iran's nuclear program is too far advanced to resurrect that
*08:23.760- 08:31.860* :  accord. But for Iran to receive the sanctions relief it wants. For Iran to engage with the region,
*08:32.440- 08:36.700* :  you know, it needs some sanctions lifting from the United States and that really is only going to
*08:36.700- 08:42.760* :  come if Iran is willing to take steps to roll back its nuclear program. So there still is time
*08:42.780- 08:48.400* :  for the United States and its international partners to try to negotiate constraints
*08:48.400- 08:53.500* :  on Iran's nuclear program. But it's critical that the United States move quickly to demonstrate
*08:53.500- 08:59.260* :  its resolve and intent. And first, in these coming months, try to de-escalate tensions. Because
*08:59.260- 09:04.800* :  given the regional situation, given Iran's threshold status, there are a number of factors that could
*09:04.800- 09:11.120* :  tip Iran towards nuclear weapons if there is a serious effort to try to de-escalate now.
*09:11.460- 09:16.580* :  And just on the other big thing going on in the Middle East, the conflict in Gaza and the
*09:16.580- 09:22.180* :  threat of an Israeli attack on southern Lebanon, are you expecting a new president to have any
*09:22.180- 09:25.440* :  role in that at all? Or is he just waiting for events and see what happens?
*09:25.680- 09:31.700* :  I think that Iran is going to continue to support its partners and proxies in the region
*09:32.240- 09:37.020* :  at the same time. Iran will likely continue to balance that support
*09:37.980- 09:42.800* :  with continuing to reiterate that it is not interested in opening a broader conflict
*09:42.800- 09:48.420* :  with Israel and the United States. And that the United States and Israel don't miscalculate
*09:48.420- 09:53.180* :  Iran's nuclear intentions and prematurely resort to force to roll back the program.
*09:53.940- 09:59.760* :  Kelsey Davenport, Director for Non-proliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association.
*10:01.160- 10:06.080* :  The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says an attack on a school near a crowded market
*10:06.540- 10:12.540* :  has killed at least 16 people and injured dozens more. Witnesses told the BBC that the attack
*10:12.540- 10:18.780* :  struck the upper floors of the school in Al-Nuzirat in central Gaza, which was sheltering thousands
*10:18.780- 10:25.100* :  of displaced Palestinians. A video of the aftermath shows a smoke-filled street full of dust and
*10:25.100- 10:30.480* :  rubble and people rushing to find the dead and injured. This witness described what he saw.
*10:34.000- 10:40.380* :  We were now to see the targeted area. We saw bodies of children. This is a playground.
*10:40.660- 10:44.260* :  There was a trampoline here. There were swings and vendors.
*10:45.280- 10:51.500* :  Civilians were killed. It's a civilian school. These are United Nations schools,
*10:52.100- 10:57.440* :  but unwire. It's supposed to be safe for people. They shouldn't ever be targeted.
*10:58.480- 11:03.780* :  After every strike, we find bodies blown to pieces. We do not see
*11:03.820- 11:10.960* :  identifiable human bodies. The Israeli military has confirmed it carried out the strike,
*11:10.960- 11:15.840* :  saying that the UN-run school was used by Hamas operatives as a command centre.
*11:16.420- 11:21.080* :  The IDF also said it took numerous steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.
*11:22.020- 11:26.680* :  A spokesman for the emergency services in Gaza said the attack showed that nowhere was safe
*11:26.680- 11:32.960* :  in the enclave for families seeking shelter. Our mid-least analyst, Sebastian Usher, is in Jerusalem.
*11:33.640- 11:41.040* :  A school in the centre of Gaza, in a refugee camp, Nusraq refugee camp, was hit around 7,000
*11:41.040- 11:46.800* :  displaced people were taking refuge there. These scenes are still being repeated across the whole
*11:46.800- 11:52.360* :  of Gaza. Up in Gaza City and Manoth, a battle has been raging in one district there, where
*11:52.360- 11:57.440* :  Israeli forces have been battling against Hamas and other Palestinian armed factions, while
*11:57.720- 12:01.980* :  right down in the south in Raffa, the Israeli military operation is still continuing there.
*12:02.360- 12:06.940* :  And just a few days ago, to the east of Hanunas, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were told
*12:06.940- 12:13.900* :  that they had to evacuate. All of this shows that fighting is still continuing in Gaza.
*12:14.580- 12:20.680* :  It underlines the urgency as momentum is building, once again, towards a resumption
*12:21.100- 12:26.440* :  of ceasefire talks and to finally secure the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza dead
*12:26.440- 12:33.180* :  or alive. Hamas gave its response to the latest proposal which was entered by President Biden
*12:33.180- 12:39.400* :  several weeks ago. It appears to be a positive response. It may even have finally overcome what's
*12:39.400- 12:45.100* :  been the main stumbling block. The demand by Hamas must be a permanent ceasefire before any movement
*12:45.100- 12:50.800* :  forward. We will still have to see if Israel, the Israeli government can accept that and make
*12:50.840- 12:56.120* :  perhaps some concession itself about its demand that it must be able to continue fighting if
*12:56.120- 13:00.400* :  necessary after any ceasefire. Sebastian Usher in Jerusalem
*13:01.940- 13:07.060* :  French voters are going to the polls on Sunday in the decisive second round of parliamentary
*13:07.060- 13:13.240* :  elections that could see a far right government formed in France for the first time since World War
*13:14.320- 13:19.860* :  2. The multiracial Paris suburb of Saint-Sandanie has featured prominently in the campaign.
*13:19.860- 13:26.000* :  It's the hometown of Jordan-Badella, the young Prime Ministerial candidate for Marine Le Pen's
*13:26.000- 13:32.560* :  National Rally and of France's football team captain, Killian Mbappe, who said last week's first
*13:32.560- 13:39.080* :  round of voting, which saw the National Rally come first, was catastrophic. The BBC's James
*13:39.080- 13:45.560* :  Cumerisami went to some of the final campaigning in a part of Saint-Sandanie where Marine Le Pen's
*13:45.560- 13:50.940* :  party is trying to beat the candidates from the left wing new popular front coalition.
*13:58.120- 14:04.960* :  It's the last day of school and it's got a crowd of little kids and parents here outside the
*14:06.320- 14:12.520* :  primary school in Ville-Mom and there's one extra person here. It is the socialist candidate
*14:13.820- 14:19.400* :  for this area. She nearly got the 50% needed to be re-electing in the first round but she just
*14:19.400- 14:25.440* :  missed out. She is facing someone from the National Rally and she's trying to persuade everyone here
*14:25.440- 14:34.920* :  to give her her vote. Make sure your friends go
*14:34.920- 14:40.180* :  and vote. The message from Fatia Keloah Ashi to one of the mum's waiting at the school gates.
*14:40.220- 14:45.600* :  The former French teacher is battling for re-election in a runoff against the National Rally.
*14:45.600- 14:55.220* :  She told me what was at stake. The first big deal is to avoid a government with an
*14:55.220- 15:00.160* :  extreme right because it's one of the big deal that we have today with this election.
*15:03.600- 15:08.420* :  A mother of supporters handing out leaflets, one young woman with an international perspective.
*15:09.120- 15:15.840* :  My name is Jan. I'm 19 years old. I grew up in France in Ruinisouwap but I lived in the US for two
*15:15.840- 15:21.580* :  years. How do you think the world is looking on at France at the moment? I don't think anybody
*15:21.580- 15:28.860* :  really expected for the far right parties to get that much approval from the electors.
*15:29.420- 15:34.840* :  I think everyone is judging friends very harshly right now and they're right to do so.
*15:35.420- 15:42.180* :  Not far from the school waiting for her Basime 27-year-old Dorian. She's upset and angry at
*15:42.180- 15:48.040* :  France's precarious political situation and at a president whose unprompted decision to hold
*15:48.040- 15:53.920* :  this election has she says opened a Pandora's box. People don't need Macron to be racist
*15:54.140- 16:01.580* :  but he did enable something to happen and he doesn't care. I don't know exactly what his endgame
*16:01.580- 16:07.920* :  is but it's disgusting and as a black person in France I am absolutely revolted and
*16:07.920- 16:13.920* :  disgusted by what's going on right now and by the fact that our mainstream media are saying
*16:13.920- 16:20.820* :  nothing about the racist attacks that are now taking place daily since the Assembly
*16:20.860- 16:26.580* :  was dissolved. The National Rally says some of its candidates have also been attacked in a country
*16:26.580- 16:33.620* :  that feels on the edge but of what? We couldn't ask its local candidate who said he was unavailable
*16:33.620- 16:40.360* :  but the party's leader whose face is on the posters in this suburb, Jordan Badella says the answer
*16:40.360- 16:49.260* :  is simple change. I believe that the National Rally can win this election on Sunday with an absolute
*16:49.260- 16:55.500* :  majority. I intend to form a national unity government and to implement the recovery project
*16:55.500- 17:01.740* :  that I presented to the country and the only person to talk about the substance and to talk
*17:01.740- 17:07.020* :  about the daily lives of the French, the cost of living, security and immigration.
*17:08.280- 17:13.420* :  The socialists should come out top in this metropolitan multi-racial constituency
*17:14.180- 17:18.680* :  but they're partly to blame for the populist rights continuing success in France
*17:18.680- 17:22.640* :  according to Paris-based author and journalist Andrew Hussey.
*17:23.480- 17:28.300* :  And I do think you know whatever happens on Sunday if the National Rally move forward
*17:28.740- 17:33.080* :  you have to point the finger at the failure of the left and two huge blocks in the left,
*17:33.080- 17:38.580* :  the socialist party and you know pride to that the communist party. I've left working class people
*17:39.240- 17:45.660* :  of all ethnic persuasions feeling abandoned and lost and the National Rally who are very
*17:45.660- 17:50.620* :  stateless in the economic policies who promised to nationalise this and who promised to nationalise
*17:50.620- 17:55.440* :  that. They promise that you know you won't be at the service of globalised market forces
*17:55.860- 17:58.920* :  you will again be in charge of your destiny and it's a very enticing promise.
*17:59.500- 18:04.840* :  But will that be enough to take the National Rally into government? A scenario that many in
*18:04.840- 18:10.180* :  France clearly want but plenty of others fear. James Kumar Assami
*18:12.040- 18:18.480* :  Wallfare leaves behind many elements that often take decades to resolve. A good example is
*18:18.480- 18:23.860* :  landmines that continue to kill and maim sometimes many years after the end of conflict.
*18:24.640- 18:30.700* :  Now Japan is to work with Cambodia on a complex international project to help detect and remove
*18:30.700- 18:37.380* :  landmines. With marsh has this report. Cambodia's recent history has made it the reluctant emblem of
*18:37.380- 18:43.000* :  the demining industry. The Indochina Wars, the Vietnam War, the rule of the Khmer Rouge and
*18:43.000- 18:48.680* :  the insurgency that followed left Cambodia strewn with millions of mines and other unexploded
*18:48.680- 18:53.800* :  ordnance. Thousands of people have been killed by landmines since the Khmer Rouge was driven from
*18:53.800- 19:00.840* :  power in 1979. Thousands more have had limbs amputated because of their injuries. Only last year
*19:00.840- 19:06.600* :  a school was closed after more than 2,000 explosive devices were found. Through this suffering,
*19:06.600- 19:12.660* :  Cambodia has emerged as a world leader in landmine countermeasures and its government aims to clear
*19:12.660- 19:18.060* :  it of hidden explosives by next year. Under the enhanced cooperation agreement with Japan,
*19:18.060- 19:23.200* :  Cambodia will serve as a hub for training and knowledge sharing on landmines, while Japan
*19:23.200- 19:29.200* :  will provide expertise in mine detectors and AI technology that predicts where devices may
*19:29.200- 19:34.600* :  have been laid. One beneficiary will be Ukraine, which has been littered with landmines and
*19:34.600- 19:40.820* :  explosive remnants since Russia's full-scale invasion two years ago. Ukrainian personnel will
*19:40.820- 19:46.800* :  be trained on Japanese demining equipment in Cambodia as early as next month. 5th Marsh
*19:49.640- 20:06.900* :  Still to come in this podcast, why the authorities in Pakistan are concerned about the annual

*21:32.460- 21:37.440* :  Power cuts in Ukraine have been getting longer and more frequent as Russia continues to target
*21:37.440- 21:43.020* :  the country's energy system. 100,000 people are without power in the Northeastern
*21:43.020- 21:48.780* :  Sumi region after one such attack. As a result electricity needs to be rationed.
*21:49.300- 21:55.400* :  That creates serious problems for millions of Ukrainians, no running water, lifts or access
*21:55.400- 22:01.880* :  to life-saving medical equipment. Vitaly Shchefchenko reports. Over the past three months alone,
*22:01.880- 22:07.500* :  Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity as a national energy company,
*22:07.500- 22:12.600* :  Okranerho says. And this has more than a third of the capacity that Ukraine had before the
*22:12.600- 22:18.620* :  full-scale invasion. Okranerho spokeswoman Maria Taturian says the situation is unprecedented.
*22:19.240- 22:26.180* :  All state-owned thermal power plants are destroyed. Actually all thermal power plants and all
*22:26.180- 22:33.120* :  hydro power plants in our country damaged with Russian missiles and drones. So, of course,
*22:33.120- 22:38.340* :  this lack of generation caused the deficit in the power grid.
*22:39.080- 22:44.360* :  To cope Okranerho has had to implement a policy of sweeping power cuts across the country,
*22:44.360- 22:51.620* :  which last for many hours a day, every day. But for some uninterrupted power supplies are
*22:51.620- 22:57.780* :  literally a matter of life and death. Here's the counter from Odessa. Her son was born disabled
*22:57.780- 23:03.980* :  and needs electricity-powered equipment to be able to breathe, to be fed and to receive medication.
*23:07.340- 23:13.600* :  We're very dependent on electricity. If it wasn't for this bloody war life would be difficult,
*23:13.600- 23:19.080* :  but we'd be able to cope. Because of the endless power cuts it's extremely difficult.
*23:20.040- 23:25.240* :  We need to make sure there's a constant supply of electricity. We've got a generator which runs
*23:25.240- 23:30.680* :  on petrol, but it needs to be topped up all the time. It runs for six hours at a time and then it
*23:30.680- 23:36.540* :  has to be stopped. Because it needs to cool down and we need to top up the fuel. And then we restart
*23:36.540- 23:42.540* :  it to get the electricity flowing again. Taturian says power cuts also affect mobile phone coverage,
*23:43.060- 23:48.580* :  so getting through to the ambulance service is a struggle. The capital Kiev has also been
*23:48.580- 23:55.140* :  suffering lengthy power cuts. Aroksalana was elected by residents of her 24 store apartment block
*23:55.140- 24:04.200* :  to help run the building's facilities. It's not easy living in tower blocks because power cuts
*24:04.200- 24:09.680* :  also mean no running water on the upper floors. The lifts are not working either, so mothers
*24:09.680- 24:14.880* :  with children and disabled people have to wait. They plan their trips outside depending on
*24:14.880- 24:19.980* :  where there's electricity. They've got to stay indoors for six hours on end. Our elderly
*24:19.980- 24:25.840* :  ladies can't pop out to the shops to get their bread. So many residents and tall buildings are stuck
*24:25.840- 24:31.580* :  inside sweltering apartments because air conditioning isn't working and they're also further
*24:31.580- 24:37.740* :  exposed to Russian air strikes because they are unable to go down to the bomb shelter. In Zaporizia
*24:37.740- 24:43.740* :  Dentist Vladimir Stefanyev uses a head torch to perform minor operations during blackouts,
*24:44.420- 24:48.500* :  but there have been occasions when electricity disappeared during complicated surgery.
*24:52.700- 24:58.720* :  If this happens, we start our generators so we can finish what we have begun. There's no other way.
*24:58.720- 25:04.700* :  We can't tell the patient to come back tomorrow. Power cuts in the summer are hugely disruptive,
*25:04.700- 25:11.040* :  but Ukrainians fear to think what will happen in winter if Russia continues pounding their
*25:11.040- 25:19.360* :  energy system. Vitaly Shevchenko reporting. Another day and another democratic member of the U.S.
*25:19.360- 25:24.940* :  Congress has called on President Biden to drop out of November's election race. Some public
*25:24.940- 25:30.940* :  opinion polls have shown Donald Trump widening a lead since the debate and a Reuters Ipsos
*25:30.940- 25:36.920* :  poll found that one in three Democrats want Biden to quit the race. On Friday, in a television
*25:36.920- 25:42.460* :  interview, Mr. Biden had insisted he was the best person to stand despite what he called his
*25:42.460- 25:48.080* :  bad night during last week's TV debate with Donald Trump. Here's our North America correspondent,
*25:48.080- 25:53.740* :  Peter Bose. In all, five Democrats in the House of Representatives have called on Joe Biden
*25:53.740- 25:59.100* :  to step aside. The latest to come forward is Angie Craig, a member from the state of Minnesota.
*25:59.820- 26:04.780* :  She said she didn't believe that the president could effectively campaign and win against Donald
*26:04.780- 26:10.420* :  Trump. There was, she said, simply too much at stake, and Mr. Biden should make way for a new
*26:10.420- 26:15.520* :  generation of leaders. While those senior members of the party have called on the president to quit,
*26:15.520- 26:22.180* :  the unease among Democrats is palpable. In an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos,
*26:22.440- 26:26.440* :  the president blamed his disastrous debate performance on a bad cold,
*26:26.940- 26:31.500* :  asked whether he would take a cognitive test and release the results. He said it wasn't necessary
*26:31.500- 26:37.800* :  because his mental ability was challenged every day through his work. He warned of dire consequences
*26:37.800- 26:43.080* :  if Donald Trump were to win the election and insisted he was the most qualified candidate
*26:43.080- 26:48.500* :  to stop the former president. And if you stay in and Trump is elected and everything you're
*26:48.500- 26:54.480* :  warning about comes to pass, how will you feel in January? I feel as long as I gave it my all
*26:54.480- 27:00.240* :  and I did the goodest jobs I know I can do. That's what this is about. Mr. Biden added that
*27:00.240- 27:06.440* :  only the Lord Almighty could convince him to abandon his bid for a second term in the White House.
*27:06.800- 27:13.620* :  Peter Bose. The Pakistani authorities are always anxious about the annual commemoration of
*27:13.620- 27:19.320* :  Muharam when shears throughout the country take to the streets in huge numbers. Some of them
*27:19.320- 27:25.920* :  using blades to slash their backs as people around them chant. This is from last year's Muharam.
*27:37.360- 27:42.780* :  It's a time of heightens, communal tensions and most years there are extremists who try to
*27:42.780- 27:50.040* :  disrupt the events, sometimes with a violence. Well this year 143 Pakistani clerics are facing
*27:50.040- 27:54.520* :  bans on their speeches and travel to try to prevent them causing trouble.
*27:55.420- 28:01.900* :  Hassan Abbas is now a professor at National Defence University in Washington DC but he used to
*28:01.900- 28:07.620* :  be in the Pakistani police. So what does he think of these restraining orders? Will they work?
*28:08.640- 28:16.560* :  Not really. I find this a bit ironic that they have curtailed these rights I would say of these
*28:16.560- 28:22.980* :  140 scholars both from the Shia background and the Sunni background but this is in the context of
*28:22.980- 28:30.780* :  Muharam when most Muslims and especially shears and Sufis commemorate the death anniversary of
*28:31.260- 28:37.800* :  grandson of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him Hussein and his 72 members of the family.
*28:38.860- 28:45.760* :  This indirectly says that you are allowed to give hateful speeches throughout the year and only
*28:45.760- 28:52.980* :  in these 10 days or 20 days you have to stop. So you are free to create the environment of hatred
*28:53.560- 29:01.400* :  for the rest of the year and these days you stop them so this is a very strange old tactic which
*29:01.400- 29:07.140* :  which hardly I don't think it is going to really impact. Well yes I take your point but it is a time
*29:07.140- 29:11.560* :  of heightened tension isn't it and the police are always worried in fact you are in the police
*29:12.100- 29:17.540* :  you worked in the Pakistani police and you had to deal with worrying about keeping these things
*29:17.540- 29:26.880* :  peaceful. That is true however I would I mean I understand the logic and today to give them
*29:26.880- 29:35.520* :  this extra benefit of the route given the impact of social media these things can very quickly
*29:35.520- 29:42.240* :  escalate so if there is one clip and you can pick some clip out of a long speech and which is
*29:42.240- 29:47.280* :  out of context and you say look this is what is happening this is blasphemous or they they are
*29:47.280- 29:51.860* :  ridiculing shears or she shears are saying terrible things about some knees or the the the
*29:51.860- 29:57.340* :  the river personalities and it can the social media and given what has happened in Pakistan and
*29:57.340- 30:03.460* :  against Christians in Punjab also in Heber Paktumha province against some of the people who were
*30:03.460- 30:08.980* :  killed who were lynched to death. So I understand their point that they're thinking no such thing
*30:09.580- 30:17.060* :  should create a stare and lead to this but however this should be part of a longer policy
*30:17.580- 30:24.520* :  when people who are known to give such terrible speeches and create hatred should not should
*30:24.520- 30:32.060* :  should be stopped or prosecuted in a legal sense when they do such things because they're
*30:32.060- 30:39.060* :  being profiled but but why especially to pick this time to go for such an action now then the
*30:39.280- 30:43.640* :  the shears make up actually you'll have a much better number than me but what 15 to 20 percent
*30:43.640- 30:49.820* :  of of the population and yet these these commemorative events and these massive street
*30:49.820- 30:55.000* :  processions happen right throughout the cities of Pakistan don't they? That is true I would say
*30:55.000- 31:00.940* :  based on what scholars say yes 15 to 20 percent they go up to 25 percent that that's between
*31:00.940- 31:07.680* :  20 and 25 might be more accurate however in certain areas especially urban centers sheers might be
*31:07.680- 31:15.160* :  more in numbers secondly they are traditionally since the old times in these processions especially
*31:15.160- 31:20.940* :  on the 10th of moharam when it is called asura that is when many Sunnis also come out so many
*31:20.940- 31:27.560* :  Sufi oriented Sunnis also come out but many Sunnis this was part and I personally a person
*31:27.560- 31:32.540* :  level I come from a mixed family with both she and Sunni traditions and I know that this is
*31:32.540- 31:38.200* :  commemorated among the Sunnis as well in in a in a big way so the big processions you see are
*31:38.200- 31:43.720* :  are maybe 80 percent or 70 percent shears but 20 to 30 percent are the Sunnis also
*31:44.420- 31:49.200* :  that was Hassan Abbas a professor at the national defense university in Washington DC
*31:49.200- 31:56.880* :  speaking to the BBC's Owen Bennett Jones a French cyclist has been fined about 225 dollars
*31:57.480- 32:02.280* :  after he stopped to kiss his wife and two-year-old Sun during a time trial at this year's
*32:02.280- 32:07.420* :  Tour de France the international cycling union said it brought the image of the sport into
*32:07.420- 32:13.520* :  distribute Judy Frankel reports Julie Ambelle now did not expect to win Friday's time trial
*32:13.940- 32:18.880* :  but the 32-year-old Frenchman did something he'll treasure for the rest of his life with the race
*32:18.880- 32:24.260* :  held very close to his home in Burgundy the little trek rider was greeted by crowds of cheering
*32:24.260- 32:29.980* :  supporters as he cycled past them as he reached the top of the climb friends ran towards him
*32:29.980- 32:35.840* :  holding signs and his wife stepped forward holding their son and gave him a quick kiss in a
*32:35.840- 32:40.600* :  television interview afterwards Benar said his wife had planned the encounter weeks before
*32:41.120- 32:45.400* :  and that he'd cycled faster at the beginning so he would have enough time to greet them
*32:45.780- 32:54.220* :  it was amazing in modern cycling it's not easy to stop and see your family but here with
*32:54.220- 32:59.500* :  a time trial it was perfect because I could take the time to really savor it and I did it was
*32:59.500- 33:05.000* :  incredible the governing body find him for what it called unseemly or inappropriate behavior during
*33:05.000- 33:11.480* :  the race and damaging the image of the sport writing on social media Benar apologized for any
*33:11.480- 33:16.700* :  damage he may have caused but said he would happily pay the fine every day to experience the moment
