*01:33.820- 01:36.920* :  Kenyan police say they have arrested a serial killer

*02:02.720- 02:05.880* :  and the fans who accuse her of people trafficking.
*02:06.300- 02:08.760* :  They are absolutely ridiculous
*02:09.660- 02:11.760* :  and that they need to run back to their parents.
*02:12.460- 02:15.820* :  And a new malaria vaccine is rolled out in Africa.
*02:20.320- 02:23.080* :  On Sunday's podcast, we told you about the discovery
*02:23.080- 02:26.540* :  of eight mutilated corpses found in a rubbish dump
*02:26.540- 02:28.620* :  in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.
*02:29.280- 02:32.860* :  That figure is now up to nine and there may be many more.
*02:33.320- 02:36.080* :  Kenyan police have arrested a suspect who they say
*02:36.080- 02:38.560* :  has admitted murdering 42 women.
*02:39.120- 02:41.360* :  A senior police officer, Mohamed Amin,
*02:41.660- 02:44.820* :  said they were dealing with a psychopathic serial killer.
*02:45.700- 02:48.340* :  We have this morning arrested the prime suspect
*02:49.200- 02:55.940* :  known as Collins-Jumayisa-Halusha, 33 years old.
*02:56.700- 03:00.580* :  On interrogation, the suspect confessed to have
*03:00.580- 03:06.100* :  lured, killed and disposed, 42 female bodies
*03:06.380- 03:07.260* :  at the dumping site.
*03:08.280- 03:12.060* :  All murdered between 2022
*03:13.720- 03:19.500* :  and as recent as last day, 11th of July, 2024.
*03:20.260- 03:22.200* :  But from the look of things,
*03:23.260- 03:25.440* :  it is crystallizing that we are dealing
*03:26.380- 03:31.340* :  with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer
*03:32.360- 03:35.540* :  who has no respect for him or live.
*03:35.820- 03:39.820* :  France's Antwoma is the security correspondent at KTN News
*03:39.820- 03:42.500* :  and he's been to the site where the bodies were found.
*03:43.300- 03:45.580* :  It has been a horror, I can tell you,
*03:45.580- 03:49.140* :  that I've covered crime and homicide for the longest time,
*03:49.140- 03:51.540* :  but this one was something out of the blue,
*03:51.540- 03:53.520* :  something that is really horrifying.
*03:53.800- 03:56.200* :  So we had bodies that were decomposing
*03:56.200- 03:58.420* :  that were fetched out of a dump site
*03:58.420- 04:01.900* :  that is at Kware area in Mokuru, Kwanjanga.
*04:02.380- 04:05.040* :  That is a slam area that is 3 to 4 kilometers
*04:05.040- 04:07.240* :  from the capital Nairobi.
*04:07.940- 04:10.040* :  And all these bodies were all female.
*04:10.040- 04:13.040* :  They were mutilated, some were dismembered
*04:13.080- 04:15.060* :  and they were all stashed in sacks.
*04:15.560- 04:18.880* :  Our correspondent in Nairobi, Ian Wafula, told us more.
*04:19.440- 04:23.840* :  As at this point, it's still not clear who the identities
*04:23.840- 04:24.900* :  or the nine bodies are.
*04:25.260- 04:27.520* :  But then police do say that the suspect
*04:27.520- 04:30.200* :  has confessed to having killed the first victim
*04:30.200- 04:32.680* :  being his wife and they managed to identify her
*04:32.680- 04:34.520* :  as Judith Kalena.
*04:34.960- 04:36.200* :  And so it's still not clear
*04:36.200- 04:40.020* :  because they're still looking at the facts behind these murders,
*04:40.020- 04:41.460* :  the fact behind these bodies.
*04:41.460- 04:43.960* :  And so we're waiting to see how that unfolds.
*04:44.200- 04:44.940* :  However, in the meantime,
*04:44.940- 04:47.680* :  Rachel, police have asked families here in Kenya
*04:48.000- 04:49.500* :  who believe that they have reasonable
*04:50.100- 04:52.280* :  believe that their loved ones may have fallen victim
*04:52.280- 04:53.900* :  to the murders to come forward
*04:53.900- 04:56.140* :  and try to identify these bodies, Rachel.
*04:56.840- 04:58.160* :  And there's been much criticism
*04:58.220- 05:00.580* :  that violence against women in Kenya
*05:00.580- 05:02.960* :  is not taken seriously enough, isn't there?
*05:03.760- 05:04.720* :  Yeah, that has been the case.
*05:04.760- 05:06.600* :  In fact, about two months ago,
*05:06.600- 05:09.480* :  the BBC covered protest right here in the capital
*05:09.480- 05:11.840* :  in Nairobi where women and human rights groups
*05:11.840- 05:14.180* :  are saying that the police have been relaxed.
*05:14.180- 05:16.600* :  So to say, when it comes to investigating cases
*05:16.600- 05:19.860* :  against family side, given that they had been on their rights
*05:20.260- 05:22.860* :  and there were reports that about 500 women
*05:22.860- 05:25.860* :  had been killed within a period of one year.
*05:26.240- 05:28.360* :  So this will contribute to the kind of criticism
*05:28.360- 05:29.480* :  that the police are getting.
*05:29.480- 05:32.140* :  In fact, human rights groups are calling for further investigation.
*05:32.140- 05:34.460* :  And even before I came on air to speak to you,
*05:34.740- 05:37.680* :  a group of women, members of parliament, including governors
*05:37.680- 05:39.960* :  are calling for further investigation,
*05:40.300- 05:43.580* :  especially because the police say that the nine bodies
*05:43.580- 05:45.020* :  they retrieved are all women.
*05:45.020- 05:47.920* :  And then the suspect comes for us and says that he has actually,
*05:48.360- 05:49.420* :  for a period of two years,
*05:49.720- 05:51.900* :  murdered about 42 women, Rachel.
*05:52.520- 05:54.080* :  Ian Wafula in Nairobi.
*05:55.160- 05:57.060* :  The former US president, Donald Trump,
*05:57.060- 06:00.040* :  is in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention,
*06:00.500- 06:04.280* :  where he'll be confirmed as the Republican presidential candidate
*06:04.280- 06:07.200* :  and is expected to pick his vice president.
*06:07.780- 06:10.100* :  Both Mr. Trump and President Joe Biden
*06:10.220- 06:12.140* :  are trying to dial down the rhetoric
*06:12.140- 06:14.780* :  after Saturday's failed assassination attempt
*06:15.100- 06:17.040* :  at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.
*06:17.840- 06:20.180* :  President Biden told Americans that people
*06:20.180- 06:23.680* :  needed to lower the political temperature and stand together.
*06:24.280- 06:26.860* :  And Donald Trump told the Washington Examiner newspaper
*06:26.860- 06:29.400* :  that he'd completely rewritten his speech
*06:29.400- 06:32.800* :  to call for national unity instead of targeting
*06:32.800- 06:34.560* :  President Biden's policies.
*06:35.080- 06:37.700* :  Our correspondent, Nomiya Iqbal, is in Milwaukee
*06:37.700- 06:40.060* :  and has been speaking to Trump supporters
*06:40.520- 06:43.920* :  who see the form of president's survival as simply miraculous.
*06:44.840- 06:47.720* :  Thank God for protecting President Donald Trump yesterday.
*06:49.440- 06:50.980* :  There are dozens of Donald Trump supporters
*06:50.980- 06:52.520* :  congregated in this park,
*06:52.520- 06:54.280* :  just in the convention center.
*06:55.080- 06:58.540* :  One of the pastors here is leading a speech.
*06:58.960- 07:02.000* :  And just next to me, there's this huge photo
*07:02.420- 07:05.140* :  of Donald Trump laid out on the graphs.
*07:05.160- 07:08.000* :  And there's a big card that says get well soon
*07:08.240- 07:10.220* :  and lots of people are signing it
*07:10.620- 07:11.600* :  in support of Donald Trump.
*07:12.140- 07:12.680* :  I love him.
*07:13.820- 07:15.180* :  So I can say it's I love him.
*07:15.420- 07:18.400* :  Ray Paul has driven here to attend this visual for Donald Trump
*07:18.400- 07:19.380* :  in his blue van.
*07:19.860- 07:20.880* :  On the outside of the vehicle,
*07:20.880- 07:22.720* :  the former president's policy accomplishments
*07:22.720- 07:23.900* :  are all printed in white.
*07:24.140- 07:26.380* :  What was your reaction when he heard that he'd been shot?
*07:26.620- 07:28.020* :  Oh gosh, I cried.
*07:28.860- 07:29.560* :  Couldn't believe it.
*07:30.080- 07:32.260* :  But God, it's in God's hands.
*07:32.260- 07:34.120* :  I'm glad I'm glad it happened now
*07:35.020- 07:37.500* :  because now his security will be even better than it was.
*07:37.980- 07:39.920* :  Turning his head in a particular direction
*07:39.920- 07:41.140* :  actually saved his life.
*07:41.720- 07:43.620* :  So we are thankful to God for that.
*07:44.220- 07:46.840* :  Donald Trump's supporters here will already all answer him.
*07:46.960- 07:48.120* :  They said the attempt on his life
*07:48.140- 07:50.000* :  has made them even more entrenched.
*07:50.160- 07:51.220* :  And then I saw the news
*07:51.880- 07:54.440* :  and I saw our epic leaders stand up
*07:54.820- 07:57.340* :  in the face of terror being injured and say,
*07:57.580- 07:59.000* :  fight, fight!
*07:59.700- 08:02.900* :  And we have got to fight now more than ever for our nation
*08:03.360- 08:04.440* :  because our nation is in the balance.
*08:05.960- 08:07.280* :  Linda is here with her friend,
*08:07.280- 08:09.300* :  Fan Shorn, from the state of Nebraska.
*08:09.660- 08:12.780* :  People are the man of what their democratic party has done.
*08:13.180- 08:14.360* :  They're voting for Donald Trump.
*08:14.360- 08:16.600* :  I can't say how many people that say,
*08:17.140- 08:17.560* :  we're done.
*08:17.800- 08:19.060* :  We voted for Biden,
*08:19.060- 08:20.780* :  but we're not voting for him anymore.
*08:21.380- 08:22.320* :  You think the,
*08:22.340- 08:23.540* :  it's definitely an attempt to
*08:23.540- 08:25.100* :  score more people behind him?
*08:25.280- 08:26.080* :  Are you kidding me?
*08:26.820- 08:28.040* :  Every time something happens,
*08:28.640- 08:29.820* :  more money is raised.
*08:30.040- 08:30.920* :  I fell on Americans.
*08:31.160- 08:32.260* :  In an address to the nation,
*08:32.260- 08:34.620* :  President Biden aimed to lower the temperature.
*08:35.260- 08:37.040* :  And when he came to violent language and actions,
*08:37.620- 08:39.080* :  he cast the net widely.
*08:39.440- 08:40.760* :  Violence has never been the answer,
*08:41.620- 08:43.100* :  where there's with members of Congress
*08:43.120- 08:44.920* :  of both parties being targeted in the shot,
*08:45.820- 08:48.680* :  or a violent mob attacking the Capitol on January 6th,
*08:49.200- 08:50.640* :  or brutal attack on the spouse,
*08:50.640- 08:53.080* :  a former speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.
*08:54.120- 08:57.740* :  Or information and intimidation on election officials,
*08:58.460- 09:00.940* :  or the kidnapping plot against the city governor,
*09:01.600- 09:03.760* :  or an attempted assassination on Donald Trump.
*09:04.520- 09:07.140* :  There's no place in America of this kind of violence.
*09:07.760- 09:08.800* :  The U.S. Speaker of the House,
*09:08.820- 09:09.980* :  Republican Mike Johnson,
*09:10.400- 09:12.660* :  also called on both sides to tone it down.
*09:12.800- 09:14.940* :  This is a horrific act of political violence
*09:14.940- 09:16.500* :  that ought to be roundly condemned.
*09:17.120- 09:20.300* :  Obviously, we can't go on like this as a society.
*09:20.640- 09:22.160* :  But others are playing the blame game.
*09:22.580- 09:25.720* :  Some Republicans are saying in flammatory comments about Mr. Trump
*09:26.300- 09:28.980* :  by parts of the media and the Democratic Party
*09:29.280- 09:30.280* :  led to this violence.
*09:31.020- 09:32.560* :  Here's his son, Donald Trump, Jr.
*09:32.560- 09:36.180* :  I don't want to ever hear another word about January 6th,
*09:36.520- 09:38.140* :  you know, after July 13th.
*09:38.560- 09:39.820* :  Not one more.
*09:40.080- 09:41.480* :  It needs to stop.
*09:41.620- 09:44.480* :  This turbulent election race has taken another sharp turn.
*09:45.620- 09:47.700* :  Contrast those pictures of a defiant
*09:47.700- 09:50.520* :  and bloody Donald Trump with President Biden,
*09:51.100- 09:52.880* :  who still views him as a threat to democracy,
*09:53.400- 09:55.200* :  but now compelled to show some compassion.
*09:56.000- 09:58.220* :  As a convention gets underway here in Wisconsin,
*09:58.360- 09:59.940* :  amid very tight security,
*10:00.700- 10:03.840* :  America's two political parties will have to now hugely adjust
*10:04.520- 10:06.540* :  to an entirely changed campaign.
*10:07.840- 10:09.340* :  Nomiya Ikbal reporting.
*10:10.240- 10:12.740* :  In China, the economy has been sluggish,
*10:12.980- 10:15.820* :  mainly because people aren't willing to part with their money.
*10:16.300- 10:20.320* :  But a rather innocuous sounding meeting of the Chinese Communist Party,
*10:20.740- 10:21.820* :  the third plenum,
*10:22.240- 10:24.560* :  might be key to turning the economy around.
*10:24.560- 10:27.800* :  And what happens in China affects the world's economy.
*10:28.320- 10:29.960* :  Stephen McDonald is in Beijing.
*10:31.020- 10:33.280* :  There's been considerable speculation that this week's
*10:33.280- 10:36.380* :  big political meeting here in Beijing will involve
*10:36.620- 10:38.960* :  some sort of major announcements
*10:40.380- 10:43.200* :  around the lines of what plans the government has
*10:43.200- 10:45.040* :  to turn around the Chinese economy.
*10:45.540- 10:47.220* :  And the reason for this is precedent.
*10:48.520- 10:50.500* :  The Central Committee, the full Central Committee,
*10:51.140- 10:52.200* :  with its hundreds of delegates,
*10:53.000- 10:56.100* :  over a five-year term meets roughly seven times.
*10:56.640- 10:59.620* :  The third of these meetings, known as the third plenum,
*11:00.260- 11:02.360* :  has often involved major announcements
*11:02.360- 11:05.460* :  of significant changes to policy.
*11:05.460- 11:08.060* :  And the thinking is this time around, it could be the same.
*11:08.640- 11:12.520* :  Because the word modernization was included in the blurb
*11:12.880- 11:13.680* :  introducing the meeting,
*11:13.680- 11:16.760* :  it's thought that we could see an even greater push
*11:16.940- 11:18.780* :  from the central government to drive funds
*11:19.460- 11:20.820* :  into the high-tech industries,
*11:20.820- 11:22.440* :  which are really taking off here,
*11:22.440- 11:25.480* :  like solar power, like electric vehicles.
*11:25.480- 11:27.000* :  But the question is,
*11:27.320- 11:28.600* :  even if this was to work,
*11:28.600- 11:31.480* :  would a newly modernized Chinese economy
*11:31.480- 11:33.140* :  necessarily employ enough people
*11:34.100- 11:36.340* :  give wages enough of a boost
*11:36.920- 11:39.140* :  to drive up household consumption.
*11:39.220- 11:40.440* :  And that's what's needed
*11:41.360- 11:45.000* :  to have a significant change in the economy here.
*11:46.040- 11:46.920* :  The meeting itself though,
*11:46.920- 11:49.440* :  it, you know, by and large, would just rubber stamp
*11:50.080- 11:51.980* :  decisions already made by the senior leadership
*11:51.980- 11:53.080* :  of the Communist Party.
*11:53.500- 11:56.000* :  It takes place over four days behind closed doors
*11:56.000- 11:59.060* :  and so we won't know until Thursday night at the end
*11:59.060- 12:00.620* :  when they give us an official readout
*12:01.100- 12:02.800* :  if there is to be some sort of
*12:03.020- 12:05.220* :  significant change in economic policy
*12:05.840- 12:07.260* :  or in China's political system.
*12:07.880- 12:09.480* :  Stephen MacDonald in Beijing.
*12:10.600- 12:13.500* :  Argentina's record in football's copper America
*12:13.500- 12:14.380* :  is remarkable.
*12:14.940- 12:16.760* :  Their 1-0 victory over Colombia
*12:16.760- 12:18.540* :  and Sunday's final in Miami
*12:18.980- 12:20.420* :  means they've won the competition
*12:20.420- 12:22.220* :  a record 16 times.
*12:22.980- 12:24.980* :  It was expected that the big talking point
*12:24.980- 12:27.180* :  would be how Leonor Messi performed
*12:27.180- 12:30.300* :  and whether this would be his last international game.
*12:30.300- 12:33.000* :  But much of the attention was on the chaos
*12:33.280- 12:35.660* :  and violent clashes outside the stadium.
*12:42.400- 12:46.060* :  Our sports reporter Sarah Menai told me about the problems
*12:46.160- 12:47.600* :  in the run-up to the match.
*12:47.800- 12:50.540* :  Kikov was delayed by 80 minutes.
*12:51.100- 12:54.560* :  Reports said that an estimated 7,000 people
*12:54.560- 12:56.820* :  arrived at a stadium without tickets
*12:57.660- 13:00.040* :  and tried to force their way into the stadium
*13:00.040- 13:04.340* :  prior to Kikov, leaving some fans waiting for hours
*13:04.340- 13:07.480* :  in the Miami heat for the gates to open.
*13:07.480- 13:09.920* :  So video were posted on social media
*13:09.920- 13:13.600* :  that showed fans jumping over security railings.
*13:14.040- 13:16.940* :  So both teams were taken off the pitch
*13:16.940- 13:19.000* :  during their warm-up sessions.
*13:19.680- 13:22.080* :  The stadium briefly went on lockdown.
*13:22.780- 13:25.780* :  The security was overwhelmed by the amount of people
*13:25.780- 13:27.100* :  trying to force their way in.
*13:27.240- 13:28.780* :  So we know if anyone was hurt.
*13:29.080- 13:30.020* :  We don't have figures yet,
*13:30.020- 13:31.300* :  but yeah, definitely some people will
*13:31.300- 13:35.840* :  injured because we've seen medical emergency teams
*13:36.460- 13:38.280* :  on the ground trying to help people,
*13:38.280- 13:40.120* :  trying to people that were crushed.
*13:40.580- 13:42.160* :  We don't have the exact figures for now.
*13:42.160- 13:44.060* :  We will definitely have them in a couple of hours
*13:44.060- 13:46.460* :  to see how the situation had evolved.
*13:46.900- 13:50.800* :  This copper America cup has been plagued with problems
*13:50.820- 13:51.900* :  with the crowds, is it not?
*13:52.480- 13:54.200* :  Yes, it's definitely not the first time.
*13:54.500- 13:56.800* :  The scenes we've seen in Miami
*13:56.840- 14:00.500* :  came only two days after a very angry
*14:01.300- 14:04.240* :  Uruguayan manager, Marcelo Bielsa,
*14:04.660- 14:06.820* :  criticized tournament organizers
*14:07.760- 14:10.640* :  for not doing enough to protect fans in the stadiums
*14:10.640- 14:12.940* :  and to protect families of his players
*14:13.100- 14:14.900* :  because during the semi-final
*14:14.900- 14:16.780* :  that Uruguay played against Colombia,
*14:17.420- 14:19.760* :  some families were attacked in the stands
*14:20.160- 14:22.080* :  and some players had to intervene
*14:22.080- 14:23.860* :  and to go in the stands to save
*14:24.180- 14:25.380* :  the family that they were in the stands
*14:25.680- 14:27.360* :  being attacked by Colombian fans.
*14:27.740- 14:29.280* :  So it's definitely not the first time.
*14:29.720- 14:32.080* :  It poses really serious questions
*14:32.080- 14:34.200* :  about the next World Cup in two years.
*14:34.200- 14:35.620* :  You know, this stadium in Miami
*14:35.620- 14:37.440* :  where the final was taking place last night,
*14:38.040- 14:40.540* :  the hard rock stadium is supposed
*14:40.540- 14:43.300* :  to be hosting seven World Cup games
*14:43.300- 14:45.540* :  and that poses really serious concerns
*14:45.560- 14:49.040* :  about whether this World Cup is going to be safe enough
*14:49.040- 14:50.440* :  for fans to travel there.
*14:51.060- 14:53.800* :  Obviously after that, the football did eventually go ahead.
*14:53.800- 14:54.720* :  Tell us what happened.
*14:55.040- 14:59.040* :  Neil, all after the 90 minutes regular time
*14:59.140- 15:00.500* :  so it went into extra time
*15:00.560- 15:02.260* :  and it's Laotaro Martinez
*15:02.860- 15:05.020* :  who was a hero of a nation for Argentina.
*15:05.440- 15:07.220* :  He's called the only goal of the game
*15:07.220- 15:09.260* :  that was in the second half of extra time.
*15:09.860- 15:12.160* :  And this game apparently may have
*15:12.160- 15:15.840* :  signaled the end of Lionel Messi's international career.
*15:16.260- 15:17.200* :  Lionel Messi, of course,
*15:17.200- 15:20.080* :  one of the world's most renowned footballers.
*15:20.340- 15:24.100* :  Lionel Messi refuses for now to officially announce
*15:24.140- 15:25.740* :  that that was his last game.
*15:25.740- 15:27.640* :  He said he wants to go on.
*15:27.680- 15:30.360* :  He said he's still ready to play for his country
*15:30.960- 15:32.660* :  but he's already 37 years old.
*15:32.660- 15:34.840* :  He's going to be 39 at the next World Cup.
*15:35.260- 15:37.820* :  So it's difficult to imagine Lionel Messi
*15:38.560- 15:40.380* :  going to that World Cup.
*15:41.380- 15:43.320* :  Bear in mind that tonight he was,
*15:43.600- 15:45.020* :  he left the pitch early
*15:45.020- 15:48.060* :  because he sustained an injury, an ankle injury.
*15:48.640- 15:50.420* :  And he was a very emotional scene
*15:50.420- 15:53.000* :  because he was seen on the bench crying.
*15:53.040- 15:56.820* :  So we'll have to see about the end of his international career.
*15:57.400- 15:59.560* :  Our sports reporter Sarah Menai.
*16:00.060- 16:01.340* :  Well, a few hours earlier,
*16:01.340- 16:04.940* :  Spain beat England and the final of the euros in Germany.
*16:05.540- 16:07.300* :  Later on Monday, they're expected to receive
*16:07.300- 16:09.440* :  a rapturous reception back home.
*16:09.900- 16:11.760* :  These fans in Madrid were preparing
*16:11.760- 16:13.300* :  through a day of celebrations.
*16:14.080- 16:16.840* :  I'm absolutely thrilled.
*16:17.200- 16:19.640* :  I'm going to work with a big smile on my face today.
*16:19.840- 16:20.900* :  Delighted to have won.
*16:22.160- 16:23.160* :  It's divine.
*16:23.160- 16:24.260* :  It was wonderful.
*16:24.260- 16:26.500* :  I'm extremely proud of my country.
*16:26.500- 16:27.520* :  I'm really happy.
*16:28.120- 16:30.820* :  We suffered a bit at first, but it's all good now.
*16:32.200- 16:33.220* :  It's a happy day.
*16:33.220- 16:34.300* :  Let's party.
*16:34.860- 16:36.320* :  Of course, we're celebrating.
*16:37.080- 16:40.620* :  I'm going for a run and then I'll enjoy the rest of the day.
*16:41.360- 16:41.980* :  Lucky him.
*16:42.420- 16:45.300* :  Well, Spain ended the tournament as top scorers
*16:45.300- 16:48.440* :  and other first men's team to win the euros four times.
*16:49.000- 16:50.980* :  Their coach, Luis de la Fuenta,
*16:51.360- 16:54.140* :  has praised his players as an example for society.
*16:54.660- 16:55.900* :  Guy Hedgeko is in Madrid.
*16:56.720- 16:57.740* :  Going into the tournament,
*16:57.920- 17:01.380* :  Spanish fans really weren't that confident about their team.
*17:01.420- 17:04.020* :  They didn't expect it to get very far at all.
*17:04.320- 17:06.520* :  And as the competition went on,
*17:06.520- 17:08.900* :  they became more and more confident in their team
*17:08.900- 17:11.060* :  and more and more impressed by how it's performing.
*17:11.800- 17:13.800* :  Something which has been talked about a lot
*17:13.800- 17:16.680* :  throughout this tournament has been the issue of immigration
*17:16.740- 17:19.600* :  because a couple of the big stars of this team
*17:20.200- 17:22.120* :  are children of African immigrants.
*17:22.160- 17:23.320* :  And that's La Minya,
*17:23.360- 17:24.720* :  the 17-year-old winger,
*17:25.040- 17:26.380* :  who's been such a sensation.
*17:26.900- 17:28.260* :  And the other winger in the team,
*17:28.260- 17:29.040* :  Niko Williams,
*17:29.660- 17:31.120* :  child of Ghanaian parents.
*17:31.880- 17:35.700* :  And that has triggered a lot of talk about the issue of immigration
*17:35.840- 17:38.940* :  which has become quite a hot button issue politically,
*17:39.460- 17:40.740* :  particularly for the far right.
*17:40.780- 17:43.700* :  And so a lot of people have been saying how this shows
*17:43.700- 17:45.600* :  that the country can unite
*17:45.600- 17:49.480* :  and immigration can be a good thing for the country.
*17:49.940- 17:51.920* :  And that the Spanish football team
*17:51.920- 17:56.020* :  does in fact reflect Spain's multicultural reality.
*17:56.620- 17:57.900* :  Guy Hegeco in Madrid.
*18:00.020- 18:00.820* :  Still to come.
*18:01.300- 18:02.960* :  You won't believe what's in one of the pictures.
*18:02.960- 18:04.160* :  And I said, watch, she goes,
*18:04.400- 18:06.380* :  we think there's a bullet flying behind his head.
*18:06.880- 18:08.020* :  We hear from a photographer
*18:08.020- 18:10.580* :  who took photos of former President Trump
*18:10.580- 18:12.180* :  at the Pennsylvania Rally.
*18:20.880- 18:24.080* :  This season, Instacart has your back to school.
*18:24.760- 18:27.760* :  As in, they've got your back to school lunch favorites
*18:27.760- 18:29.460* :  like snack packs and fresh fruit.
*18:29.900- 18:31.820* :  And they've got your back to school supplies
*18:31.820- 18:34.280* :  like backpacks, binders, and pencils.
*18:35.160- 18:36.940* :  And they've got your back.
*18:37.380- 18:39.100* :  When your kid casually tells you
*18:39.100- 18:42.000* :  they have a huge school project to do tomorrow,
*18:42.720- 18:44.920* :  let's face it, we were all that kid.
*18:45.620- 18:48.700* :  So first, call your parents to say I'm sorry.
*18:48.980- 18:51.400* :  And then download the Instacart app
*18:51.440- 18:53.800* :  to get delivery in as fast as 30 minutes

*18:57.320- 18:59.780* :  with your first three orders while supplies last.

*19:03.820- 19:05.000* :  It's summer in Britain
*19:05.220- 19:07.220* :  and the crimes that just getting started.
*19:07.540- 19:08.560* :  We've found another body.

*19:11.180- 19:12.100* :  only on Britbox.

*19:18.740- 19:20.000* :  Back up, back up, Ava!
*19:20.040- 19:20.820* :  And the responder,
*19:21.160- 19:22.180* :  starring Martin Freeman
*19:22.180- 19:24.620* :  in his international Emmy award-winning role.
*19:24.660- 19:25.880* :  I can feel it, I'm gonna crack.
*19:25.900- 19:27.980* :  Stream the best of British crime drama
*19:28.200- 19:28.820* :  on Britbox.
*19:29.080- 19:31.020* :  No, this is why I want to be a detective.
*19:31.400- 19:32.720* :  Watch with a free trial today.
*19:39.580- 19:40.920* :  Rwandans have been voting
*19:40.920- 19:43.340* :  in presidential and parliamentary elections
*19:43.340- 19:46.460* :  with the African nation's leader Paul Kagami
*19:46.460- 19:48.660* :  widely expected to cruise to victory
*19:48.660- 19:51.360* :  and extend his rule for another five years.
*19:51.820- 19:54.620* :  There are only two challenges facing Mr Kagami
*19:54.940- 19:56.920* :  who's been Rwandan's day facto leader
*19:56.920- 19:59.460* :  since the end of the 1994 genocide
*19:59.460- 20:01.880* :  and president since 2000.
*20:02.440- 20:04.240* :  The lineup is a carbon copy
*20:04.240- 20:06.600* :  of the last election in 2017
*20:06.600- 20:09.640* :  where Mr Kagami obliterated his rivals
*20:09.640- 20:12.220* :  with almost 99% of the vote.
*20:12.740- 20:15.120* :  Our senior Africa correspondent Ann Sawy
*20:15.120- 20:17.580* :  has been speaking to the BBC's Rob Young.
*20:18.400- 20:20.980* :  This is a president who has won previous elections
*20:20.980- 20:22.340* :  with more than 90%
*20:22.380- 20:23.840* :  and it has been rising.
*20:23.840- 20:25.420* :  The last election in 2017
*20:25.420- 20:28.780* :  is secured 99% of the vote
*20:29.060- 20:30.720* :  and we're talking about a very huge
*20:30.720- 20:34.460* :  voter turnout, 96% of registered voters
*20:34.460- 20:37.740* :  turning out and 99 of those voting for the president
*20:37.840- 20:39.700* :  and therefore his critics have been
*20:40.080- 20:42.780* :  talking about this and saying that how can it be
*20:43.300- 20:45.960* :  and looking at this election and previous elections as well
*20:46.440- 20:48.640* :  some of the opposition or would be a position
*20:49.800- 20:52.000* :  not allowed to run in this election.
*20:52.000- 20:55.260* :  There are several people who wanted to run for president
*20:55.260- 20:58.200* :  but they were ruled out by the Electoral Commission
*20:58.660- 21:00.620* :  and that he's really feeling those criticisms
*21:00.620- 21:02.680* :  against President Kagami that
*21:03.000- 21:05.660* :  but he has spoken to these things during their campaigns
*21:05.660- 21:07.440* :  he said that they're those who think 100%
*21:07.720- 21:10.320* :  is not a democracy and some of his critics are saying
*21:10.320- 21:12.200* :  he hopes to improve that 99%
*21:13.340- 21:15.700* :  and he says there are many who voted elsewhere
*21:16.080- 21:17.200* :  into office with 15%
*21:17.280- 21:18.700* :  how is that democracy?
*21:19.340- 21:20.580* :  So that is really the position.
*21:21.140- 21:22.340* :  He hopes to improve on his 99%
*21:22.340- 21:24.320* :  that's quite an ambition, isn't it?
*21:24.360- 21:25.900* :  So there are some opposition candidates
*21:25.900- 21:27.740* :  just not the candidates
*21:27.740- 21:29.640* :  some parties would have liked to have put forward.
*21:30.240- 21:30.660* :  That's right.
*21:30.660- 21:34.000* :  There's Frank Habinez of the Democratic Green Party
*21:34.560- 21:36.960* :  and an independent candidate who's a civil servant
*21:37.000- 21:38.420* :  Philippe Paimana.
*21:39.180- 21:40.640* :  Frank Habinez is 47.
*21:40.640- 21:44.700* :  He first entered politics and formed this party in 2009
*21:44.840- 21:46.260* :  but then it first challenges
*21:47.340- 21:51.120* :  and in 2010 its deputy president was murdered
*21:51.880- 21:53.640* :  and then Habinez fled to Sweden
*21:53.880- 21:55.440* :  but he came back in 2017
*21:56.000- 21:56.900* :  stood in their elections
*21:57.640- 22:01.100* :  and won a parliamentary seat in 2018
*22:01.720- 22:04.880* :  the other opponent Paimana is currently a civil servant
*22:04.980- 22:06.640* :  he is running as an independent
*22:06.700- 22:08.280* :  and between these two candidates
*22:08.280- 22:10.660* :  will both run in 2017 as well
*22:10.860- 22:13.880* :  they got less than 1% between them
*22:14.300- 22:16.380* :  There have been election rallies taking place
*22:16.380- 22:19.000* :  have therefore the opposition as well as for the government
*22:19.440- 22:21.580* :  That's right and there's a stark difference
*22:21.580- 22:23.800* :  between the turnout in both rallies
*22:23.800- 22:27.340* :  so you would go to president Kagamez rallies
*22:27.340- 22:29.740* :  and there is a huge turnout
*22:29.740- 22:32.880* :  critics however say that many of the people are bussed in
*22:33.360- 22:34.500* :  to attend these rallies
*22:34.960- 22:38.660* :  when you look at the other two men running in this election
*22:39.700- 22:43.100* :  barely 100 people turning out to listen to them
*22:43.100- 22:46.720* :  so very subdued turnout during their rallies
*22:46.720- 22:49.100* :  and it really speaks to what is to be expected
*22:49.980- 22:51.000* :  in their elections today
*22:51.000- 22:54.220* :  it's a foregone conclusion that president Kagame will win
*22:54.380- 22:56.180* :  with a big big margin
*22:56.320- 22:57.420* :  and when will we get the results?
*22:57.680- 23:01.440* :  The hope is that we will have provisional results
*23:02.500- 23:04.900* :  by the end of tomorrow
*23:04.960- 23:08.140* :  and then within five days we should have
*23:08.520- 23:10.400* :  the full outcome of these elections
*23:11.360- 23:12.020* :  Ansoy
*23:12.820- 23:15.840* :  a popular wellness influencer and life coach
*23:15.840- 23:18.740* :  has been sentenced to eight years in prison in Brazil
*23:19.280- 23:21.780* :  after being found guilty of human trafficking
*23:22.460- 23:24.820* :  a judge found former model Cat Torres
*23:25.260- 23:27.740* :  who had more than a million followers on Instagram
*23:28.240- 23:30.440* :  groomed a woman on the social media platform
*23:30.440- 23:34.320* :  lured her to the US for the purpose of sexual exploitation
*23:34.720- 23:38.240* :  the BBC has also been told charges have been filed against Torres
*23:38.640- 23:40.220* :  in relation to a second woman
*23:40.620- 23:41.780* :  Hannah Price has this report
*23:42.600- 23:46.280* :  Anna was in her early 20s when she came across the perfectly curated
*23:46.280- 23:48.180* :  Instagram account of Cat Torres
*23:48.740- 23:50.740* :  she kind of resembled hope for me
*23:50.860- 23:52.420* :  she seemed like she had overcome
*23:52.880- 23:54.960* :  difficult childhood violence abuse
*23:56.160- 23:58.420* :  many of the things I related to it
*23:58.760- 24:01.500* :  she lived with Cat Torres in New York for several months
*24:01.500- 24:03.580* :  working as her live-in assistant
*24:03.580- 24:06.940* :  she says the agreed salary was two thousand dollars a month
*24:07.020- 24:10.300* :  but what waited for her was unpaid forced labor
*24:10.940- 24:12.300* :  I think I was probably one of the
*24:12.780- 24:14.380* :  first victims of human trafficking
*24:14.400- 24:20.020* :  in 2022 Cat Torres encouraged three women to come and live with her in Texas
*24:20.560- 24:22.540* :  one of the women who we are calling sole
*24:22.640- 24:25.920* :  says they were forbidden from communicating with each other
*24:26.340- 24:28.800* :  and needed Cat Torres' permission for everything
*24:29.200- 24:30.920* :  we're never allowed to leave the house
*24:31.480- 24:34.920* :  it was very difficult to get out of the situation
*24:34.960- 24:37.840* :  because she hold your money, she hold all your information
*24:37.920- 24:42.740* :  another of the women Desiree says Cat Torres used witchcraft and threats
*24:42.740- 24:46.660* :  to coerce her into stripping and eventually prostitution
*24:47.460- 24:49.800* :  she says she made thousands of dollars a week
*24:49.800- 24:55.240* :  which Cat Torres took after six weeks sole managed to get out and went to the police
*24:55.900- 24:59.140* :  in Brazil the families of the women left in the house in Texas
*24:59.140- 25:03.360* :  reported them as missing after they lost all contact with them
*25:03.940- 25:08.460* :  a US officer tracks Cat Torres down and calls her while she's on the road
*25:08.460- 25:12.220* :  he asks to speak to Desiree is she liking America?
*25:12.860- 25:13.420* :  Very nice
*25:14.360- 25:15.560* :  Are they trained you kindly?
*25:15.840- 25:16.140* :  Yes
*25:16.960- 25:17.700* :  and are you well?
*25:18.040- 25:18.240* :  Yes
*25:18.400- 25:19.600* :  You're doing well?
*25:19.760- 25:20.020* :  Yes
*25:20.840- 25:22.020* :  Cat then jumps in
*25:22.660- 25:24.820* :  and again they came here on their own
*25:25.160- 25:26.400* :  they didn't come here for me
*25:26.700- 25:27.820* :  they are helping me out
*25:27.860- 25:28.140* :  yeah
*25:29.440- 25:32.480* :  but I just want anything bad to happen to them
*25:33.400- 25:36.580* :  what Cat Torres doesn't know is that she is being recorded
*25:37.340- 25:39.880* :  and on the tape obtained by BBC News
*25:39.880- 25:42.460* :  you can hear her threatening the women in Portuguese
*25:43.360- 25:45.880* :  Cat Torres was arrested, deported to Brazil
*25:45.880- 25:50.080* :  and charged with subjecting Desiree to human trafficking and slave labor
*25:50.720- 25:52.680* :  we were granted a rare court order
*25:53.160- 25:57.540* :  allowing us to interview her in prison while she is waiting the outcome of her trial
*25:58.180- 26:01.200* :  When I was seeing the people testifying
*26:02.280- 26:05.500* :  there were saying so many lies, so many lies
*26:05.500- 26:08.460* :  that at one point I couldn't stop laughing
*26:09.460- 26:14.100* :  How does it make you feel when you're hearing that former clients are traumatized?
*26:14.100- 26:16.040* :  Do you have any emotional reaction?
*26:16.540- 26:19.860* :  I have to say they are absolutely ridiculous
*26:20.780- 26:22.900* :  and that they need to run back to their parents
*26:23.600- 26:26.100* :  Did you believe in the advice you were giving these women?
*26:26.800- 26:27.140* :  Oh yeah
*26:27.940- 26:29.580* :  I believe a thousand percent
*26:30.340- 26:33.760* :  Do you take any accountability for any of these allegations?
*26:33.840- 26:34.900* :  Absolutely not
*26:36.020- 26:36.300* :  Zero
*26:37.160- 26:40.260* :  And do you think you deserve to face any punishment or justice?
*26:40.840- 26:42.220* :  Absolutely not
*26:42.760- 26:45.320* :  Two months later Cat Torres was convicted
*26:45.360- 26:49.940* :  an investigation into the allegations brought by other women remains ongoing
*26:49.940- 26:55.780* :  Cat Torres' lawyer told the BBC she has appealed her conviction and maintains her innocence
*26:56.780- 26:58.060* :  and a price with that report
*26:58.660- 27:00.080* :  and you can hear the full story
*27:00.660- 27:04.500* :  Instagram's fake guru in the documentary on BBC sounds
*27:04.500- 27:06.240* :  or wherever you get your podcast
*27:06.240- 27:10.280* :  and you can watch the documentary on BBC World Service YouTube
*27:11.540- 27:15.820* :  Scientists have spent decades trying to produce a vaccine against malaria
*27:15.820- 27:18.520* :  that's not only effective but affordable
*27:19.140- 27:20.900* :  The disease which is spread by mosquitoes
*27:21.600- 27:24.240* :  kills more than 600,000 people a year
*27:24.740- 27:26.800* :  Many of them in low-income nations
*27:26.880- 27:32.460* :  Today the first doses of the cheapest vaccine to date are being rolled out in Cote d'Ivoire
*27:32.820- 27:34.860* :  costing under $4 a jab
*27:34.880- 27:40.780* :  The vaccine is the result of decades of research and testing at the University of Oxford in England
*27:41.460- 27:46.460* :  My correspondent Justin Webb spoke to one of the lead researchers Professor Adrian Hill
*27:46.460- 27:49.720* :  who told us why this new development is so important
*27:50.620- 27:53.000* :  It's less expensive, it's more available
*27:53.680- 27:54.940* :  and it works better
*27:55.220- 27:59.840* :  So this is a vaccine that was designed and developed in 2012
*27:59.840- 28:02.180* :  and has been progressing since then
*28:02.820- 28:07.440* :  and previous vaccines haven't been able to build on what was known previously
*28:08.260- 28:10.980* :  and develop something that really is at a price point
*28:11.520- 28:16.780* :  where it's realistic to roll this out in many tens of millions of doses from now on
*28:17.020- 28:21.220* :  What why is that? I mean why is it potentially at a price point that works
*28:21.220- 28:23.180* :  whereas the previous vaccine wasn't
*28:23.180- 28:25.720* :  What is it that has changed? What has it that's been
*28:25.720- 28:29.820* :  been able to make it available in the way that it is now going to be available?
*28:30.420- 28:31.500* :  Yeah in a word scale
*28:31.940- 28:36.700* :  So we partnered this vaccine from Oxford with the Syrim Institute of India
*28:37.380- 28:39.660* :  who are the world's largest vaccine manufacturer
*28:39.660- 28:42.480* :  they can literally make billions of doses a year
*28:42.480- 28:46.080* :  they did with us in COVID in 2020
*28:47.040- 28:50.820* :  and like for many things the greater scale you manufacture at the less
*28:51.460- 28:53.300* :  the price for an individual dose
*28:53.900- 28:56.460* :  so instead of you know this being nine or ten dollars
*28:56.460- 28:58.380* :  as with the original vaccine per dose
*28:58.780- 29:01.260* :  this is just under four dollars and that makes the real difference
*29:01.800- 29:04.760* :  in low income countries and that's why the development
*29:04.760- 29:10.540* :  with the first dose has been given almost as we speak in the Ivory Coast today
*29:10.540- 29:15.040* :  is really important because everyone sees this as an affordable vaccine
*29:15.040- 29:18.500* :  Tell us a little more about what's happening as you know it in the Ivory Coast
*29:18.500- 29:20.280* :  because the eventually it'll go out to other places
*29:20.280- 29:24.020* :  won't it gone on Igeria the Kinifasa I see here Central African Republic
*29:24.020- 29:26.540* :  but it's starting in the Ivory Coast
*29:26.640- 29:29.460* :  do you know what the setup is who's been chosen why?
*29:29.460- 29:32.860* :  Vaccine supply has gone through several countries
*29:33.540- 29:37.020* :  there is quite a bit of training of the stuff to be done before you can start
*29:37.420- 29:42.080* :  deploying this is a three dose vaccine typically five six and seven months of
*29:42.080- 29:47.780* :  age and then a booster a year later so that's not a time point that other
*29:47.780- 29:52.060* :  vaccines are usually given that so there's training required in these largely
*29:52.060- 29:56.780* :  relatively low income countries so that's a lot of work for people in
*29:56.780- 29:59.840* :  country to get set up particularly when you're aiming to
*30:00.440- 30:02.980* :  distribute millions of doses from this year.
*30:03.320- 30:08.200* :  Professor Adrian Hill let's just return to the assassination attempt on
*30:08.200- 30:12.700* :  Donald Trump and one of the incredible images to surface taken by a New York
*30:12.700- 30:16.680* :  Times photographer Doug Mills captured the image of a bullet
*30:16.680- 30:20.940* :  streaking past the former president's head so how did this veteran photographer
*30:20.940- 30:24.480* :  capture the moment he spoke to my colleague Paul Henley.
*30:25.140- 30:27.320* :  I was in the what's called the buffer zone which is
*30:27.860- 30:31.320* :  allows just four pool photographers to have that kind of access
*30:31.660- 30:35.700* :  up close and personal kind of and I was right next to the stage when he was
*30:35.760- 30:37.880* :  speaking and I happened to be directly head on
*30:38.360- 30:40.620* :  with him because we're only allowed in that buffer zone for
*30:41.280- 30:43.480* :  you know maybe five to ten minutes at the beginning of the former
*30:43.480- 30:47.340* :  president's remarks so I knew I had to get my you know my work done early and
*30:48.100- 30:53.800* :  and it was you know it was a regular so to speak rally for him you know lots of
*30:53.800- 30:56.680* :  people thousands of people and he was making remarks and
*30:57.620- 31:01.600* :  there was a huge flag flying over his head above him so I wanted to try and get
*31:01.600- 31:05.620* :  down low and get close to him as I could to photograph the you know him and the
*31:05.620- 31:08.540* :  foreground with the flag above him and then
*31:08.540- 31:12.040* :  that's when I you know I heard the the the pops that
*31:12.560- 31:15.920* :  happen which turned out to be gunshots I'm not a gun on
*31:15.920- 31:19.240* :  or so I don't I didn't immediately think that it was a gun
*31:19.240- 31:22.220* :  I thought it was some sort of vehicle or something like that
*31:22.900- 31:28.040* :  but when I saw him grimace and then you know grab his ear
*31:28.700- 31:31.580* :  and then immediately pull his hand off his ear and
*31:32.040- 31:34.060* :  there was blood on it and then the next thing I knew
*31:34.760- 31:36.840* :  he was down behind the podium and I couldn't see him anymore.
*31:37.200- 31:40.840* :  So you mustn't have looked away at all and you must have taken a lot of shots
*31:40.840- 31:46.040* :  in quick succession did you? I did I was using a Sony A1 camera that
*31:46.380- 31:51.400* :  and shooting it on 8000th of a second because it was such a bright sunny day and I
*31:51.400- 31:56.000* :  had a 24 millimeter lens on which has a very minimal aperture and
*31:56.040- 32:00.480* :  I probably took maybe 20 frames during that that moment
*32:01.160- 32:04.100* :  and I you know Paul I did not know that I had that picture
*32:04.940- 32:07.700* :  until probably 40 minutes after it happened
*32:07.740- 32:11.540* :  because I was you know so concerned with getting the pictures out of
*32:11.700- 32:14.900* :  the former president being escorted off the stage by the secret service that
*32:15.780- 32:18.860* :  it kind of you know kind of slipped my mind that I was even taking pictures
*32:19.260- 32:23.660* :  during that moment obviously a lot of adrenaline going I'm shaking
*32:23.660- 32:27.500* :  you know everybody still amped up and yelling and you know
*32:28.020- 32:31.080* :  then we went backstage to a secure area because
*32:31.680- 32:35.360* :  we were walking through what they were calling a crime scene so we had to go
*32:35.360- 32:39.320* :  into a special tent which normally the president holds in before he comes
*32:39.320- 32:43.940* :  on stage so then I started looking through the pictures and I thought oh my gosh
*32:43.940- 32:47.720* :  I think I did take pictures while he was speaking when this all started so I
*32:47.720- 32:52.360* :  started looking back and I saw him grimace and then
