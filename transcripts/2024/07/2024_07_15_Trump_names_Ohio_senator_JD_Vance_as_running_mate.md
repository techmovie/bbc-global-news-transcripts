*01:37.360- 01:39.440* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway and this edition is published
*01:39.440- 01:42.180* :  in the early hours of Tuesday, the 16th of July.
*01:42.780- 01:44.440* :  At the Republican National Convention,
*01:44.440- 01:47.340* :  Donald Trump names Ohio Senator JD Vance
*01:47.340- 01:50.160* :  as his running mate for the US presidential election.
*01:50.980- 01:53.380* :  The Pakistani government moves to ban the party
*01:53.380- 01:55.840* :  of the jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan
*01:56.640- 01:59.620* :  and lawmakers in the Gambia defy religious conservatives
*01:59.900- 02:02.700* :  to uphold a ban on female genital mutilation.
*02:05.520- 02:06.280* :  Also in the podcast.
*02:06.800- 02:09.260* :  Most of the knowledge we have about polar bear movements
*02:09.260- 02:12.740* :  and habitat selection and behavior comes from female bears.
*02:13.100- 02:14.580* :  So these tags give us a window
*02:15.180- 02:16.600* :  into seeing what these males are doing
*02:16.600- 02:17.880* :  during different times of the year.
*02:18.220- 02:20.340* :  The tracking device scientists hope will give them
*02:20.340- 02:23.960* :  a new insight into the world's largest land-based predator
*02:24.680- 02:28.180* :  and could a cave on the moon provide shelter for astronauts.
*02:33.640- 02:37.320* :  Just two days after Donald Trump narrowly escaped assassination,
*02:37.320- 02:41.460* :  his Republican party has begun its big pre-election jamboree
*02:41.480- 02:42.940* :  in the swing state of Wisconsin.
*02:43.520- 02:46.980* :  Delegates and alternate delegates, ladies and gentlemen,
*02:47.760- 02:51.680* :  welcome to the 2024 Republican National Convention.
*02:54.220- 02:56.800* :  Proceedings began with a state-by-state roll call
*02:56.800- 02:59.620* :  of delegates officially nominating Donald Trump
*02:59.620- 03:01.340* :  as their presidential candidate.
*03:01.760- 03:05.460* :  One of the first up was chairman of the Republican Party in Iowa, Jeff Kaufman.
*03:06.260- 03:10.060* :  Over the next four days, we will hear about the many failures
*03:10.060- 03:11.600* :  of the Biden-Harris administration.
*03:12.360- 03:15.880* :  The sustained criticism does not proceed from a mean
*03:15.880- 03:20.080* :  or narrow partisanship, but from the broad and sincere concern
*03:20.140- 03:23.340* :  for the well-being and safety of our fellow Americans.
*03:24.080- 03:27.240* :  More importantly, we will also hear about Donald Trump's broad
*03:27.240- 03:29.840* :  and inspiring vision for our country.
*03:30.340- 03:32.620* :  This is Donald's program just for Republicans,
*03:33.100- 03:35.160* :  but one for all Americans.
*03:37.220- 03:39.680* :  Later in the afternoon, the excitement continued
*03:39.680- 03:43.500* :  as news emerged of Donald Trump's choice of running mate.
*03:44.080- 03:48.000* :  The vice presidency is an office of sacred trust.
*03:48.220- 03:54.740* :  The man who accepts this nomination accepts with it the awesome responsibility
*03:54.900- 03:57.920* :  to give wise counsel to the president,
*03:59.020- 04:03.700* :  to represent America abroad, to preside over the Senate,
*04:04.180- 04:07.680* :  and to be ready to lead our nation at a moment's notice.
*04:09.040- 04:11.080* :  JD Bance is such a man.
*04:13.900- 04:17.500* :  JD Bance, author of the best-selling book Hillbilly Elegy,
*04:17.500- 04:20.200* :  had been a so-called never-trumper.
*04:20.380- 04:23.740* :  He even called Mr. Trump an idiot and compared him to Hitler.
*04:24.240- 04:27.760* :  But he changed his tune, and with Mr. Trump's blessing
*04:27.760- 04:30.320* :  became Senator for Ohio last year.
*04:30.820- 04:33.940* :  Now he's on the ticket to become Mr. Trump's vice president.
*04:34.720- 04:37.480* :  I asked our North America correspondent David Willis
*04:37.480- 04:40.200* :  why the former president had picked JD Bance.
*04:40.700- 04:43.760* :  Very good question Oliver, and in a lengthy posting
*04:43.760- 04:48.760* :  on his truth social network, Donald Trump hailed the achievements
*04:48.760- 04:51.300* :  of his new running mate, JD Bance.
*04:51.300- 04:54.280* :  And he added that Mr. Bance will, as he put it,
*04:54.280- 04:58.460* :  be strongly focused on the people of Pennsylvania,
*04:58.460- 05:02.860* :  Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and beyond.
*05:03.000- 05:04.600* :  That's significant, I think, Oliver,
*05:04.600- 05:08.980* :  because that's a clear indication that the former president believes
*05:08.980- 05:12.440* :  that this is a man who can boost his campaign
*05:13.200- 05:15.640* :  in what are known as the rust belt states here,
*05:15.640- 05:19.640* :  those states where the presidential race is at its closest.
*05:20.400- 05:22.180* :  To directly answer your question, however,
*05:22.180- 05:25.340* :  I think another reason that JD Bance has been selected
*05:25.340- 05:26.480* :  is his age.
*05:26.480- 05:29.660* :  He is 39 years of age.
*05:29.660- 05:32.320* :  That is roughly 40 years younger,
*05:32.320- 05:34.400* :  would you believe, than Donald Trump?
*05:34.420- 05:36.960* :  And some are saying that this represents
*05:36.960- 05:42.860* :  a sort of passing of the torch as far as the mega right wing
*05:42.860- 05:45.140* :  is concerned on the part of Donald Trump.
*05:45.140- 05:49.400* :  This is a man who supports that make America great again,
*05:49.400- 05:52.220* :  doctrine of right wing populism.
*05:52.220- 05:54.500* :  And Mr. Bance wasn't always, as you mentioned,
*05:54.500- 05:55.680* :  a fan of Donald Trump.
*05:56.140- 05:58.240* :  He wants to liken to the former president to Hitler,
*05:58.240- 06:02.020* :  but he since become a full-throated defender
*06:02.760- 06:04.280* :  of the Trump agenda.
*06:04.600- 06:06.840* :  And why does Mr. Trump think he'll do well
*06:06.840- 06:08.100* :  in those battleground states?
*06:08.120- 06:09.920* :  Is it because he's background in Ohio
*06:09.920- 06:12.120* :  and that book he wrote, Hillbilly Elegy?
*06:12.500- 06:14.920* :  That's it. That's a large part, the reason.
*06:15.100- 06:16.660* :  And there is, of course, the age.
*06:17.020- 06:19.920* :  I think it's particularly that that his policies
*06:19.920- 06:22.920* :  so echo those of Donald Trump.
*06:22.920- 06:25.400* :  This is a man who served in the military.
*06:25.400- 06:29.160* :  He's a former venture capitalist best-selling author.
*06:29.800- 06:32.120* :  And I suppose the big question is,
*06:32.120- 06:36.000* :  can he win over skeptical suburban housewives,
*06:36.000- 06:40.100* :  given that he doesn't necessarily exactly personify
*06:40.100- 06:42.920* :  those sort of widespread calls that we've had
*06:43.500- 06:45.120* :  since the shooting on Saturday
*06:45.680- 06:50.380* :  for a more unified approach to national presidential politics?
*06:50.380- 06:55.240* :  And Mr. Bance is much more an attack dog in the words of Sam.
*06:55.240- 06:57.900* :  And this, as one commentator here, put it all over,
*06:58.160- 07:02.920* :  this is not a kumbaya pick as far as J.D. Bance is concerned.
*07:03.200- 07:06.320* :  And have we had any democratic reaction to his nomination?
*07:06.760- 07:10.200* :  Well, we've had a brief word from Joe Biden
*07:10.200- 07:13.820* :  basically saying that this man is a clone of Donald Trump
*07:13.820- 07:14.940* :  as he put it.
*07:15.420- 07:19.040* :  But otherwise, the president is preferring to keep his counsel
*07:19.560- 07:23.020* :  on the selection of J.D. Bance, who was a short while ago,
*07:23.020- 07:25.240* :  welcomed onto the stage, I might add,
*07:25.240- 07:29.380* :  the Republican National Convention alongside his wife.
*07:29.920- 07:32.160* :  Now North America correspondent David Willis,
*07:32.200- 07:34.140* :  where hours before the convention opened,
*07:34.140- 07:36.760* :  Donald Trump was handed a major legal victory
*07:36.760- 07:39.220* :  by a Florida judge that he had appointed.
*07:39.900- 07:43.180* :  Eileen Cannon throughout the secret documents case against him.
*07:43.520- 07:46.220* :  The decision came just weeks after the Supreme Court ruled
*07:46.220- 07:49.260* :  that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.
*07:49.260- 07:51.860* :  I heard more from Ioni Wells in Washington.
*07:52.380- 07:54.300* :  Well, this case really centered around the fact
*07:54.340- 07:58.120* :  that dozens of classified files essentially documents
*07:58.120- 08:00.940* :  containing sensitive national security information
*08:00.940- 08:03.620* :  were found in Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago
*08:03.620- 08:07.120* :  resorts, including in a shower and a storage cupboard.
*08:07.660- 08:11.660* :  And he was facing multiple charges here of mishandling
*08:11.660- 08:13.900* :  these classified documents, essentially holding onto them
*08:13.900- 08:16.020* :  after he left office and left the White House
*08:16.400- 08:17.780* :  after he lost the last election.
*08:17.780- 08:20.600* :  He was also accused of obstructing efforts
*08:20.600- 08:22.320* :  by the government to try and get back
*08:22.320- 08:23.960* :  some of this sensitive information.
*08:24.460- 08:26.120* :  Now, these were very serious allegations.
*08:26.160- 08:28.500* :  It would have been accusations of federal crimes
*08:28.500- 08:32.140* :  potentially involving prison sentences if found guilty.
*08:32.140- 08:34.460* :  And he was the first former president
*08:34.460- 08:37.780* :  to be prosecuted by the government in a case like this.
*08:38.080- 08:41.120* :  And why has Judge Eileen Cannon thrown it out?
*08:41.560- 08:43.060* :  Well, what's interesting is her ruling
*08:43.060- 08:45.320* :  doesn't center around the merit of the case
*08:45.460- 08:47.340* :  and whether the actual case and accusations
*08:47.860- 08:48.660* :  have merit themselves.
*08:48.820- 08:50.440* :  It centers around the prosecutor
*08:50.440- 08:52.080* :  who was put in charge of this.
*08:52.260- 08:54.960* :  It was to Smith who was essentially the lawyer
*08:55.200- 08:57.340* :  leading the prosecution is the reason
*08:57.340- 08:59.300* :  that Judge Cannon has thrown out this case.
*08:59.520- 09:02.120* :  She argues that because he had not been named
*09:02.120- 09:04.340* :  to be the sort of special counsel by the president
*09:04.340- 09:05.540* :  or confirmed by the Senate,
*09:05.880- 09:07.560* :  his appointment broke what is described
*09:07.560- 09:10.280* :  as the appointments clause of the US Constitution.
*09:10.280- 09:12.820* :  Essentially, she argues that the Justice Department
*09:13.320- 09:14.640* :  appointing this prosecutor
*09:15.140- 09:16.860* :  violates the US Constitution.
*09:17.020- 09:19.280* :  Now, it is likely that the prosecution
*09:19.280- 09:21.300* :  are going to appeal this ruling,
*09:21.660- 09:23.080* :  but it's very significant at the meantime,
*09:23.080- 09:25.200* :  another big win for Donald Trump
*09:25.440- 09:26.900* :  in a series of legal challenges
*09:26.900- 09:28.160* :  that he's facing at the moment.
*09:28.160- 09:31.380* :  After earlier this month, the Supreme Court had also ruled
*09:31.380- 09:33.900* :  that former presidents were granted some immunity
*09:33.900- 09:36.020* :  from cases during his presidency.
*09:36.300- 09:37.940* :  Yeah, I mean, interesting ruling in Florida,
*09:37.940- 09:39.420* :  isn't he also the prosecutor
*09:39.420- 09:41.180* :  in the storming of the Congress case?
*09:41.660- 09:42.160* :  That is right.
*09:42.160- 09:44.820* :  And this ruling today doesn't apply to that case.
*09:44.820- 09:47.180* :  But as you say, there are kind of numerous other cases
*09:47.760- 09:48.840* :  that Donald Trump is facing.
*09:48.840- 09:51.840* :  There is, as you say, this question of whether Donald Trump
*09:51.840- 09:55.460* :  conspired to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden.
*09:55.920- 09:57.800* :  The allegation is that he pressured officials
*09:57.800- 09:59.280* :  to try and reverse the results,
*09:59.280- 10:02.620* :  knowingly spread falsehoods about election fraud
*10:02.620- 10:04.960* :  and also sought to exploit those capital riots
*10:04.960- 10:07.000* :  on the 6th of January in 2021
*10:07.000- 10:10.200* :  to try and delay Mr Biden's victory in the stay in power.
*10:10.200- 10:12.300* :  Now, he has denied any wrongdoing.
*10:12.300- 10:14.880* :  And he's also claimed that the Biden administration
*10:14.880- 10:16.700* :  is behind that particular prosecution.
*10:16.800- 10:19.480* :  Now, that one isn't affected by today's ruling.
*10:19.920- 10:22.300* :  However, it does look like with that particular case,
*10:22.380- 10:24.880* :  there isn't likely to be a trial anytime soon.
*10:24.880- 10:26.720* :  He's launched an appeal of the case.
*10:26.720- 10:28.140* :  And as we've discussed already,
*10:28.140- 10:29.760* :  claimed he has broad immunity
*10:29.760- 10:31.320* :  from prosecution as presidents.
*10:31.820- 10:35.760* :  I only else in Washington moving away from the US.
*10:35.920- 10:37.480* :  Now, in the government of Pakistan,
*10:37.480- 10:40.000* :  says it intends to ban the political party
*10:40.000- 10:42.040* :  of the former Prime Minister Imran Khan.
*10:42.040- 10:44.240* :  He has been in jail for nearly a year
*10:44.240- 10:45.520* :  on a variety of charges,
*10:46.020- 10:48.200* :  all of which he says are politically motivated.
*10:48.220- 10:52.160* :  Tahab Askar in Lahore spoke to Rachel Wright.
*10:52.700- 10:55.200* :  It looks like that on the heels of relief
*10:55.200- 10:57.480* :  given to the PTI by the top court
*10:57.860- 11:01.040* :  that is Supreme Court of Pakistan in the reserved seat case.
*11:01.600- 11:04.440* :  According to PTI, they're saying that the move appears
*11:04.440- 11:08.580* :  to be an attempt to prevent into former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party
*11:08.580- 11:12.120* :  from becoming the single largest party in national assembly.
*11:12.500- 11:13.660* :  While talking to media,
*11:14.000- 11:16.280* :  the Information Minister of Pakistan-Atatara
*11:16.280- 11:19.120* :  said that the PTI and Pakistan
*11:19.120- 11:20.480* :  cannot move together,
*11:20.480- 11:24.220* :  because we are going to put a ban on this party,
*11:24.220- 11:26.640* :  because there are so many cases against them,
*11:26.900- 11:28.140* :  like a cipher case,
*11:28.720- 11:30.280* :  ninth-may-right cases,
*11:30.780- 11:32.560* :  and foreign funding cases.
*11:33.080- 11:34.780* :  So he mentioned a few of the cases
*11:34.780- 11:38.380* :  and said that we are considering to put a ban on this party.
*11:38.680- 11:41.460* :  And we are also going to challenge the decision
*11:41.900- 11:43.760* :  that was in the favor of PTI
*11:43.760- 11:46.620* :  from Supreme Court about reserved seats,
*11:47.020- 11:50.940* :  and we're going to challenge it after getting an approval from the cabinet.
*11:51.380- 11:54.280* :  And what if any response has there been from the PTI?
*11:54.840- 11:58.760* :  Well, according to PTI, they're saying that we are looking into this
*11:58.900- 12:01.280* :  and they're saying that it looks like they're just
*12:01.680- 12:05.120* :  left with this option as they can't stop our party
*12:05.120- 12:07.820* :  to become a single largest party in national assembly.
*12:08.100- 12:11.480* :  There is also a strong reaction from the supporters
*12:11.480- 12:14.400* :  of PTI, and not only PTI,
*12:14.400- 12:15.980* :  there are a few of the people,
*12:15.980- 12:20.480* :  ex-political leadership that belongs to the governing party.
*12:20.480- 12:22.400* :  They also criticize this decision,
*12:22.400- 12:26.280* :  and they said that it looks like the government is left with no option
*12:26.280- 12:29.220* :  to stop PTI from becoming one of the largest party.
*12:29.760- 12:32.840* :  So they're also calling this decision of banning
*12:32.840- 12:36.460* :  PTI and challenging this reserved seat issue
*12:36.460- 12:39.460* :  in the Supreme Court as a nonsense decision.
*12:40.320- 12:41.880* :  Tabasca in Pakistan.
*12:42.840- 12:45.420* :  Last month, Parliament in Indonesia passed a bill
*12:45.420- 12:48.460* :  extending maternity leave from three to six months
*12:48.460- 12:49.620* :  under certain conditions.
*12:50.480- 12:53.040* :  Many see it as an improvement in women's welfare,
*12:53.040- 12:56.780* :  but there are others who fear the policy might lead to discrimination
*12:57.020- 12:58.380* :  against female workers.
*12:59.080- 13:01.540* :  Hannah Somersia has this report from Jakarta.
*13:04.560- 13:06.640* :  Sleeping soundly in her parents' embrace,
*13:07.140- 13:11.040* :  baby Gia has no idea that her life is about to change.
*13:12.220- 13:14.940* :  Under Indonesian law, Gia's mother Emma
*13:15.360- 13:17.260* :  has three months of maternity leave,
*13:17.600- 13:18.900* :  and her father, Samuel,
*13:19.320- 13:21.520* :  has two days of pay parental leave.
*13:22.340- 13:25.340* :  By the new law, Emma can prolong her maternity leave
*13:25.340- 13:28.160* :  up to six months under special circumstances,
*13:28.820- 13:30.000* :  like health complications.
*13:30.940- 13:34.520* :  With no complication, Emma has to return to work in August
*13:35.020- 13:37.640* :  when her baby is less than three months old.
*13:38.680- 13:40.140* :  Adding to Emma's frustrations,
*13:40.140- 13:42.260* :  her husband has to be back at work
*13:42.260- 13:44.760* :  while she is still recovering from a C-section
*13:45.220- 13:46.620* :  and adjusting to motherhood.
*13:48.120- 13:51.480* :  In other countries, the government gives more paternity leave,
*13:51.840- 13:55.100* :  so the fathers feel a sense of belonging as they are in fault.
*13:55.820- 13:59.180* :  But here, the father is forced to return to work in two days,
*13:59.720- 14:02.240* :  even though the husband's role is really important.
*14:03.840- 14:06.920* :  Indonesia is still behind other countries such as the UK,
*14:06.920- 14:10.100* :  which requires up to a year of maternity leave,
*14:10.440- 14:12.740* :  and up to two weeks of paternity leave.
*14:13.260- 14:17.660* :  In Singapore, working parents are entitled to four months of maternity leave,
*14:18.060- 14:19.940* :  and two weeks of paternity leave.
*14:20.620- 14:22.960* :  But other countries, such as the United States,
*14:23.440- 14:25.560* :  don't even mandate pet maternity leave.
*14:26.140- 14:28.640* :  However, the maternity leave regulations
*14:28.640- 14:30.720* :  park for the concern in Indonesia.
*14:35.340- 14:38.220* :  I am now in a busy station at the heart of Jakarta,
*14:38.480- 14:40.600* :  where workers are rushing to their offices,
*14:41.220- 14:42.260* :  including working mothers.
*14:42.920- 14:45.020* :  Many female workers are currently worried
*14:45.240- 14:47.280* :  that the new maternity leave regulation
*14:47.300- 14:50.180* :  could trigger discrimination against women.
*14:50.680- 14:53.740* :  There is a concern that women will find their job prospects
*14:53.740- 14:56.080* :  hampered as companies prefer men
*14:56.340- 14:59.780* :  who do not require up to six months of maternity leave.
*14:59.820- 15:03.240* :  In search of confirmation,
*15:03.240- 15:08.120* :  I met Shinta Khamdani, the chairman of the Indonesia Employers Association.
*15:09.440- 15:13.020* :  She had made that this concern had begun to emerge among employers.
*15:13.740- 15:20.040* :  Regulations like this may also impact in terms of the women itself.
*15:20.640- 15:22.880* :  I mean, if you imagine, you know, right now,
*15:22.880- 15:27.280* :  we want to increase the opportunity for women in the workforce,
*15:28.000- 15:32.260* :  but this kind of regulation may even jeopardize, you know,
*15:32.260- 15:34.020* :  their working opportunities.
*15:34.020- 15:36.820* :  Companies might be like, oh, it's too difficult.
*15:36.820- 15:41.020* :  Maybe we just hire more men rather than women.
*15:41.760- 15:44.200* :  A women's health activist, Nanda Dwinta,
*15:44.600- 15:46.680* :  said that this concern raises the question
*15:46.680- 15:49.940* :  of whether Indonesians have sufficient awareness
*15:50.400- 15:53.480* :  regarding gender equality to implement this rule.
*15:55.240- 15:58.060* :  Have we prepared things like warnings at all levels of society?
*15:58.140- 16:01.480* :  Decision makers, local governments, and the private sector?
*16:01.980- 16:04.360* :  Are they aware that there is a health aspect to this?
*16:04.840- 16:08.080* :  It should no longer be stigma or even discrimination against women.
*16:09.440- 16:12.700* :  For now, Emma just wants to enjoy her time with her baby,
*16:13.160- 16:15.660* :  but she realizes that time is running out.
*16:16.600- 16:19.520* :  She's worried that she will be left behind in her career
*16:19.880- 16:22.540* :  if she is way too long on maternity leave.
*16:24.220- 16:28.000* :  No matter how hard we try, we want to be able to catch up
*16:28.020- 16:29.820* :  with people who work full-year,
*16:30.500- 16:33.420* :  so we as working moms are also in a dilemma
*16:33.420- 16:36.100* :  because there may be no companies in Indonesia
*16:36.100- 16:38.220* :  that are ready to implement it.
*16:38.840- 16:40.940* :  Hannah Samaseer reporting from Jakarta.
*16:43.480- 16:45.620* :  And still to come on the Global News podcast,
*16:45.620- 16:49.380* :  the rainforest perched on the top of a mountain in Mozambique,
*16:49.500- 16:51.640* :  which is set to become a conservation area.
*16:53.020- 16:54.180* :  Music
*17:04.800- 17:07.020* :  We all know what that music means.
*17:07.020- 17:10.040* :  It's time for the Olympics in Paris.
*17:10.700- 17:12.840* :  I'm Matt Rodgers, and I'm Bowen Yang.
*17:13.340- 17:15.020* :  And we're doing an Olympics podcast?
*17:15.360- 17:16.040* :  Uh, yeah.
*17:16.040- 17:19.220* :  We're hosting the two guys, five rings podcast.
*17:19.420- 17:22.560* :  Watch every moment of the 2024 Paris Olympics
*17:22.560- 17:25.540* :  beginning July 26th on NBC and Peacock.
*17:25.720- 17:28.780* :  And for the first time, you can stream the 2024 Paris Games
*17:28.780- 17:30.220* :  on the I Heart Radio app.
*17:30.660- 17:33.580* :  And listen to two guys, five rings on the I Heart Radio app,
*17:33.800- 17:36.060* :  Apple Podcast, or wherever you get your podcasts.
*17:41.700- 17:44.200* :  Lawmakers in the West African nation of the Gambia
*17:44.200- 17:47.260* :  have upheld a ban on female genital mutilation
*17:47.260- 17:49.460* :  despite pressure from religious conservatives.
*17:50.160- 17:53.360* :  Human rights groups in the UN had urged MPs to retain the ban,
*17:53.360- 17:56.580* :  saying a bill scrapping it would undermine years of progress
*17:56.580- 17:58.020* :  in the Muslim majority nation.
*17:58.340- 18:01.160* :  I heard more about the debate from our reporter Ashley Lyme.
*18:01.700- 18:04.720* :  The bill was actually tabled by a member of parliament
*18:04.720- 18:08.580* :  who was seeking to have the FGM ban repealed.
*18:08.920- 18:11.800* :  There's been a lot of heated exchanges between MPs.
*18:12.020- 18:14.580* :  Last week, the Joint Committee of Health and Gender
*18:14.880- 18:18.300* :  tabled a report highlighting the disadvantages of FGM
*18:18.300- 18:21.940* :  after conducting several studies and even going to Egypt
*18:21.940- 18:25.040* :  to find out the harmful effects of FGM.
*18:25.420- 18:28.420* :  So it's been a battle of what's here and there.
*18:28.780- 18:31.520* :  But from last week when the reporters tabled,
*18:31.900- 18:34.900* :  MPs were able to agree with what was presented
*18:34.900- 18:37.760* :  because of the serious violation of the rights to help.
*18:38.220- 18:41.040* :  And also that FGM is causing severe physical
*18:41.040- 18:43.000* :  and emotional harm to women and girls.
*18:43.440- 18:47.580* :  And that's how they ended up changing their stance on FGM
*18:47.580- 18:49.400* :  and actually rejecting the bill.
*18:49.700- 18:51.360* :  Yes, so the ban remains.
*18:51.540- 18:55.440* :  What does that mean for women and girls in the Gambia?
*18:55.440- 18:58.320* :  Because FGM is still practiced there, understand?
*18:58.980- 19:01.300* :  Yes, FGM is still practiced in the Gambia,
*19:01.300- 19:04.060* :  but at least the fact that the ban has been maintained
*19:04.060- 19:07.580* :  will mean that maybe the Gambian government will actually
*19:08.240- 19:10.740* :  implement it because throughout the debate,
*19:10.740- 19:13.520* :  I was following it through Facebook livestream
*19:13.520- 19:16.280* :  and I could see the exchanges between citizens
*19:16.280- 19:19.120* :  who are actually commenting on the comment section
*19:19.440- 19:21.940* :  and saying that we don't care whether you ban it or not,
*19:21.940- 19:24.700* :  we shall still practice it because it's in our culture,
*19:25.100- 19:28.520* :  some are even quoting Islam as supporting FGM.
*19:28.520- 19:33.220* :  So it will depend on whether the government will implement this ban
*19:33.220- 19:35.780* :  after what parliament has decided to do.
*19:36.000- 19:39.120* :  Yes, has that been any reaction to the decision by MPs?
*19:39.320- 19:41.180* :  Yes, there's been a lot of reaction.
*19:41.180- 19:44.580* :  The citizens who are following online were exchanging wads,
*19:44.960- 19:47.440* :  rights groups and lobby groups who are actually happy
*19:47.440- 19:49.860* :  that the parliament was able to uphold a ban
*19:49.860- 19:53.180* :  because this would have taken Gambia miles and miles back
*19:53.740- 19:56.520* :  considering the work that has been done by lobby groups
*19:56.520- 19:58.460* :  and activists around the country.
*19:59.020- 20:02.780* :  And what does this mean for the battle against FGM
*20:02.780- 20:04.580* :  across the whole of Africa?
*20:04.920- 20:08.940* :  Gambia right now is a model against FGM in Africa
*20:08.940- 20:11.880* :  because it is a practice that is very prevalent
*20:11.880- 20:15.520* :  and we have typically girls, 15 years and younger
*20:15.520- 20:17.360* :  are the ones who are going through FGM
*20:17.360- 20:19.640* :  and sometimes occasionally we have adult women.
*20:20.140- 20:22.720* :  So about 200 million girls and women
*20:23.160- 20:25.000* :  globally have undergone FGM.
*20:25.360- 20:28.460* :  And in Africa we have women undergoing FGM
*20:28.460- 20:30.980* :  in about 28 countries which includes
*20:30.980- 20:33.940* :  Ritri, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
*20:33.940- 20:37.000* :  So Gambia right now is a model for Africa
*20:37.000- 20:40.740* :  to fight against FGM that has no medical benefits
*20:40.740- 20:43.680* :  of any sorts in this continent and in the world.
*20:44.220- 20:45.940* :  Ashley Lyme in Nairobi.
*20:46.940- 20:49.540* :  First identified by scientists 20 years ago
*20:49.540- 20:52.420* :  the largest piece of rainforest in southern Africa
*20:52.420- 20:54.380* :  is to become a conservation area.
*20:54.820- 20:57.500* :  Marboo forest in northern Mozambique is perched
*20:57.500- 20:58.520* :  on the top of a mountain.
*20:58.520- 21:01.780* :  Researchers have discovered dozens of new species living there.
*21:02.260- 21:05.480* :  The designation is part of a global biodiversity commitment
*21:05.480- 21:07.680* :  that almost all countries have made to protect
*21:07.680- 21:11.420* :  30% of the world's land and sea by the year 2030.
*21:11.940- 21:14.780* :  Our environment correspondent Jonah Fisher takes up the story.
*21:15.620- 21:17.920* :  Welcome to Eden, welcome to the center of Marboo Forest.
*21:18.540- 21:19.740* :  This is about as good as it gets.
*21:19.960- 21:23.740* :  There are still places on earth that humans have hardly touched.
*21:24.020- 21:25.280* :  Forest is in excellent condition
*21:25.900- 21:28.660* :  or the water is crystal clear, beautiful for drinking or washing.
*21:29.220- 21:32.800* :  Marboo forest in northern Mozambique is one of them.
*21:33.660- 21:35.840* :  It was protected by the country's long wars
*21:36.180- 21:37.600* :  in its remote location.
*21:37.700- 21:41.960* :  The forest here was for a long time only known to locals.
*21:43.000- 21:47.160* :  Then 20 years ago a mysterious dark green patch
*21:47.500- 21:49.480* :  was spotted on satellite images
*21:49.620- 21:53.760* :  by explorer and ecologist Professor Julian Bayless.
*21:54.260- 21:56.300* :  Oh my God, I mean, what have we discovered here?
*21:56.860- 21:59.440* :  When Professor Bayless went there on the ground
*22:00.240- 22:02.600* :  he couldn't believe his eyes.
*22:02.960- 22:04.940* :  We found the largest rainforest in southern Africa.
*22:05.680- 22:08.820* :  What came next was a race against time
*22:09.200- 22:10.960* :  to reveal Marboo's secrets
*22:11.580- 22:14.480* :  in the hope that it would lead to the forest being protected.
*22:17.640- 22:20.800* :  We joined Professor Bayless and a team of scientists
*22:20.880- 22:22.700* :  on their latest expedition
*22:23.280- 22:27.500* :  looking for new species in the very heart of Marboo Forest.
*22:27.760- 22:30.660* :  Marboo is an isolated patch of rainforest
*22:31.500- 22:32.400* :  almost like an island.
*22:32.400- 22:36.320* :  Professor Aramonajem is from the University of Iswatini.
*22:36.800- 22:39.500* :  This isolation has meant that the animals that live here
*22:39.500- 22:40.900* :  have lived here in isolation
*22:41.400- 22:44.620* :  and have evolved uniquely to adapt
*22:44.620- 22:46.200* :  to the Marboo environment.
*22:46.320- 22:47.700* :  There it is, okay, wait.
*22:48.000- 22:51.580* :  To date, more than 25 new species have been found.
*22:51.580- 22:53.680* :  Come here, don't go away.
*22:54.520- 22:58.820* :  Including at least 10 of Professor Bayless's favourite butterflies.
*23:01.560- 23:02.480* :  Bayless, I'm Poppiana.
*23:03.140- 23:04.180* :  Poppies name my daughter.
*23:04.180- 23:06.740* :  So this one is named after my daughter.
*23:06.760- 23:10.580* :  But it was like four meters up in a small vine.
*23:11.020- 23:13.020* :  There have also been new species of snakes,
*23:13.020- 23:15.440* :  bats, crabs and chameleon.
*23:15.760- 23:17.180* :  And that's if cambia bellisi.
*23:18.160- 23:21.360* :  It's a chameleon which is only found on Mount Marboo
*23:21.880- 23:23.320* :  in the stream by our tents.
*23:23.620- 23:27.780* :  Erica Tefella found what she thinks is a new fresh water catfish.
*23:28.300- 23:30.720* :  I hope that we have a new species for this area.
*23:30.960- 23:31.780* :  It's very exciting.
*23:32.020- 23:33.020* :  I miss it.
*23:33.620- 23:35.400* :  You guys, are you sure you would do one, too?
*23:35.900- 23:38.780* :  There's something very unique about the team's
*23:38.780- 23:41.720* :  Dung Beetle expert, Dr. Jimo Daniel.
*23:41.980- 23:43.540* :  Hold on, hold on. I want to put my gloves.
*23:44.020- 23:47.540* :  He says he's found more than 15 new species
*23:48.700- 23:52.800* :  and puts his success down to his choice of baits.
*23:53.140- 23:55.580* :  Basically, I'm using my, my, my, my, my,
*23:55.580- 23:59.200* :  my thesis tool, tool, tool as a bait to attract Dung Beetles here in the forest.
*24:00.080- 24:01.740* :  So all over this part of the forest,
*24:02.800- 24:06.160* :  there are probably Dung Beetles smelling your poo thinking,
*24:07.040- 24:08.040* :  that's correct lunchtime.
*24:08.180- 24:08.760* :  That's correct.
*24:10.840- 24:12.940* :  No, I think this time around there is brunch.
*24:16.000- 24:19.640* :  The good news is that the scientist's work is making a difference.
*24:19.640- 24:22.240* :  When we speak to the Mozambique authorities,
*24:22.240- 24:27.220* :  they confirm for the first time that all the new discoveries have convinced them
*24:27.280- 24:31.420* :  that Marbu Forest should become a conservation area.
*24:32.220- 24:37.280* :  For Professor Bayless, it will mark the end of a two-decade long journey.
*24:37.520- 24:41.580* :  We've now arrived at the end goal of protecting this forest.
*24:41.960- 24:43.500* :  This is a conservation success story.
*24:44.200- 24:44.940* :  It's nice to have one.
*24:45.340- 24:45.840* :  Yes, it is.
*24:46.560- 24:52.160* :  Hidden for so long, thanks to science, Marbu's secrets should live on.
*24:54.380- 24:56.620* :  Jonah Fisher in Northern Mozambique.
*24:57.520- 25:02.560* :  Scientists have discovered a cave on the moon, and they believe it could be used to house humans.
*25:02.580- 25:07.580* :  The researchers think it's just one part of an entire underground system that could be an ideal
*25:07.580- 25:12.100* :  location for a permanent base. Our science reporter, Georgina Radard, has the details.
*25:12.720- 25:16.440* :  Countries are racing to establish a permanent human presence on the moon,
*25:16.980- 25:20.860* :  but astronauts will need protection from radiation and extreme temperatures.
*25:21.640- 25:25.620* :  This moon cave, the first ever found, could be the perfect shelter.
*25:26.420- 25:31.660* :  It is at least a hundred meters deep, with a skylight in the lunar surface and overhanging walls.
*25:32.600- 25:35.600* :  Scientists have long thought that the moon hadn't underground world.
*25:35.620- 25:39.120* :  Professor Leonardo Carrera at the University of Trenton, Italy,
*25:39.440- 25:41.720* :  helped identify this cavern using radar.
*25:42.360- 25:45.100* :  The history of humanity, we started from caves,
*25:45.580- 25:50.440* :  and because it's a natural shelter, it's just an already an engineering feature.
*25:51.380- 25:56.560* :  If you bring this idea to the moon, a lot of things sort of sorted out, the protection from
*25:57.400- 26:01.940* :  meteorites, from radiation, and so on. You don't need really complex engineering solutions
*26:01.940- 26:04.300* :  solve this problem. It's already solved by nature in a way.
*26:04.480- 26:08.580* :  The team also visited volcanic caves on the Spanish island of Lanzarote,
*26:09.080- 26:11.040* :  the closest thing we have to this moon cave.
*26:11.860- 26:17.540* :  It's located in the Marrae Tranquilitatis, a vast rocky plane visible to the naked eye from
*26:17.540- 26:23.440* :  Earth. Helen Charman, the first British astronaut to travel to space, told BBC News that cave
*26:23.440- 26:29.320* :  has a lot of potential, but it's so deep that astronauts might need to abseil in and use jetpacks
*26:29.320- 26:34.200* :  to get out. Scientists are now hoping to deploy robots to crawl around inside,
*26:34.200- 26:36.940* :  taking pictures of this mysterious world.
*26:37.520- 26:43.300* :  Georgina Ranart, researchers in Canada say they hope to learn more about the habits of male polar
*26:43.300- 26:48.920* :  bears after developing a new type of tracking device. Normal satellite trackers tend to slip off
*26:48.920- 26:54.400* :  the bear's head. Tyler Ross at York University in Toronto told me how the new devices work.
*26:55.020- 27:01.140* :  These trackers are actually attached to the hair of polar bears, whereas conventional tags are
*27:01.140- 27:05.760* :  usually fixed around their neck or in their ears. So these are quite novel and they're attached
*27:05.760- 27:10.560* :  to the actual hair of the bears. Another benefit of the tags is that they are temporary. So,
*27:10.560- 27:16.500* :  unlike the ear tags, which have to be removed by a researcher after the fact, these fur tags are
*27:16.500- 27:21.160* :  designed to remain on a bear for a maximum of one year. Well, their bears molted sometime during
*27:21.160- 27:25.100* :  the summer. So if you were to hit the timing just right and put it on, just after they molted,
*27:25.100- 27:28.920* :  in theory, they could last a full year, but they will come off when the bear molds.
*27:29.560- 27:33.680* :  Yeah, how are they attached? So there's two different types of fur tracking tags we used.
*27:33.680- 27:38.880* :  The first uses these little crimps. So we pull the hair through the base of these plates,
*27:39.560- 27:45.140* :  slide on these copper ferals, and crimp the ferals in two directions. So it ends up looking almost
*27:45.140- 27:49.760* :  like a little ponytail. And so we do that 10 times around the base of the tags. The second method,
*27:49.760- 27:55.660* :  we used pipe brushes, which we actually slide into the tag and twist and twist as hard as we can
*27:55.660- 28:00.820* :  until we can't twist any further. And those pipe brushes really just snare the hair and grab onto
*28:00.820- 28:05.700* :  them and as we twist. And I'm guessing the bear has to be sedated while you do this.
*28:05.880- 28:11.780* :  That's correct. They're sedated when we do this. Okay. And so why are these better than normal tags?
*28:12.180- 28:16.920* :  There are just a different tool in the toolbox that allows us to track particularly male bears.
*28:16.920- 28:22.420* :  Conventional GPS collars aren't suitable for large male bears because the diameter of their neck
*28:22.420- 28:27.720* :  is actually larger than that of other head. So the collars can just slip off. So these tags afford
*28:27.720- 28:31.760* :  us the opportunity to track the movements of adult bears, which we where we can't use these
*28:31.760- 28:36.000* :  collars. Again, filling up a pretty important niche there in terms of tracking these animals.
*28:36.000- 28:41.360* :  And what are you hoping to learn? We're hoping to learn again a lot about what the male bears
*28:41.360- 28:46.120* :  are specifically doing. So most of the knowledge we have about polar bear movements and habitat
*28:46.120- 28:51.400* :  selection and behavior comes from female bears, given the constraints of being able to collar the
*28:51.400- 28:56.360* :  males. So these tags give us a window into seeing what these males are doing during different times
*28:56.360- 29:00.660* :  of the year. And do you expect it'll be significantly different from what the females do?
*29:00.860- 29:04.640* :  There's some evidence to suggest that there is some difference among males and females.
*29:04.640- 29:10.040* :  Certainly during the on land period, when they're spending their time a few months on a land in
*29:10.040- 29:14.500* :  the southern part of their range, the male bears tend to stick close to the coast and seem to be doing
*29:14.500- 29:17.700* :  different things than what the females are doing, which tend to move a little bit further inland.
*29:17.700- 29:22.300* :  And so there certainly seems to be some divergence in terms of behavior and where they're selecting
*29:22.300- 29:27.420* :  to spend their time. Now we all know that the world has been getting hotter certainly over the past
*29:27.420- 29:33.160* :  year temperatures have been rising. And what is the impact on polar bears as far as your concern?
*29:33.420- 29:38.400* :  Certainly there is an impact on bears. So they rely on the sea ice for many different things,
*29:38.400- 29:43.560* :  particularly hunting their primary prey, which is ring seal. And so if they don't have access to
*29:43.980- 29:49.060* :  sea ice, that obviously is a major problem for bears. And so we have seen a reduction, of course,
*29:49.060- 29:53.660* :  in sea ice, in different areas of the Arctic. And so that's having an impact on the bears.
*29:54.320- 30:00.060* :  The other implication given that they're likely spending more time on land, there's more of an
*30:00.060- 30:05.500* :  opportunity for them to encounter human beings living in communities along the coast. And so that's
*30:05.500- 30:11.440* :  again where these tags I think offer particular promise in monitoring and tracking bears that may be
*30:11.440- 30:15.800* :  coming into contact with humans and mitigating those encounters or preventing them ideally.
*30:16.380- 30:18.520* :  Tyler Ross from York University in Canada.
*30:21.180- 30:25.600* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon. This edition
*30:25.600- 30:29.740* :  was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and produced by Oliver Burlow, our editors Karen Martin.
