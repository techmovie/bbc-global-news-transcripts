*01:25.580- 01:29.120* :  A Valerie Sanderson ended the early hours of Wednesday, the 10th of July.
*01:29.120- 01:30.660* :  These are our main stories.
*01:31.260- 01:37.260* :  NATO members are in Washington to mark the alliances 75th birthday and to discuss support for
*01:37.540- 01:37.680* :  Ukraine.
*01:38.360- 01:42.560* :  Democratic leader in the House of Representatives holds a crisis meeting on President
*01:42.560- 01:44.380* :  Biden's re-election bid.
*01:44.940- 01:50.140* :  A Russian court is using arrest warrant for Yulia Navalnya five months after the death
*01:50.200- 01:52.920* :  of her husband, Alexina Navalny, in prison.
*01:55.220- 02:01.460* :  Also, in this podcast, we hear from two victims of FGM who underwent reconstructive surgery
*02:01.460- 02:02.160* :  in Europe.
*02:02.700- 02:03.260* :  And...
*02:03.440- 02:08.800* :  5, 4, 3, 2, 1, top.
*02:08.800- 02:11.900* :  Alima, you have to go to college.
*02:14.160- 02:19.700* :  The European Space Agency successfully launches its new Ariane 6 rocket.
*02:23.780- 02:28.140* :  NATO members have begun a three-day summit to mark its 75th birthday.
*02:28.620- 02:34.100* :  It comes just a day after Monday's ferocious series of attacks on Ukraine, which left
*02:34.100- 02:36.980* :  the country's largest children's hospital in ruins.
*02:37.620- 02:42.200* :  World leaders have condemned the strikes on civilians, which killed 42 people.
*02:42.220- 02:47.360* :  Although Moscow denies the hospital in Kiev, was hit by a Russian cruise missile.
*02:47.820- 02:54.100* :  Ukraine is high on the NATO agenda at the summit, which President Biden emphasized in his
*02:54.100- 02:54.920* :  opening remarks.
*02:56.100- 02:59.880* :  Make no mistake, Russia is failing in this war.
*03:01.080- 03:05.160* :  Over the two years in the Putin's war of choice, his losses are staggering.
*03:06.400- 03:09.140* :  Over the 350,000 Russian troops dead are wounded.
*03:10.160- 03:14.100* :  Nearly 1 million Russians, many of them young people, have left Russia because they
*03:14.100- 03:16.060* :  no longer see a future in Russia.
*03:17.400- 03:22.240* :  And Kiev, remember, Vellans and ladies, was supposed to fall on five days.
*03:22.260- 03:27.000* :  Remember, was still standing two and a half years later and will continue to stand.
*03:34.880- 03:40.000* :  All we allies knew before this war of Putin thought NATO would break.
*03:41.400- 03:44.300* :  Today, NATO is stronger than it's ever been in its history.
*03:45.720- 03:49.240* :  When this census war began, Ukraine was a free country.
*03:50.100- 03:57.280* :  Today, it is still a free country, and the war will end with Ukraine remaining a free
*03:57.700- 03:58.720* :  and independent country.
*03:59.580- 04:01.200* :  Russia will not prevail.
*04:02.780- 04:03.780* :  Ukraine will prevail.
*04:05.860- 04:12.200* :  President Biden, well, arriving in Washington in the U.S., Ukraine's president Vellodymyr Zelensky
*04:12.500- 04:15.860* :  said he'd be appealing for more sustained security guarantees.
*04:16.600- 04:20.940* :  Earlier, I spoke to our defense correspondent Jonathan Bill, who's at the summit, and asked
*04:20.940- 04:23.320* :  him, what support can Ukraine expect?
*04:24.320- 04:29.740* :  The first thing on Ukraine's list is their defenses, more Patriot batteries, which people
*04:29.740- 04:34.600* :  are taking down the cruise missiles that were fired in that mass attack recently.
*04:35.180- 04:40.240* :  There is going to be a specific pledge about providing Ukraine with more military assistance
*04:40.300- 04:46.860* :  for the next year, at least $40 billion U.S. worth of military aid for 2025.
*04:46.900- 04:53.340* :  There was a hope Yen Stoltenberg had that he could persuade NATO allies to have an agreement
*04:53.340- 04:58.160* :  to a long-term commitment to five years for military assistance to Ukraine.
*04:58.160- 05:02.120* :  But he hasn't been able to achieve that, not least because of the political uncertainties
*05:02.500- 05:07.320* :  here in Washington about what might happen, or not in this year's presidential election,
*05:07.320- 05:14.760* :  and also some European countries too, not able to commit to a share of their GDP to commit to
*05:14.760- 05:20.840* :  Ukraine. So there won't be that long-term support, but certainly a long-term signal of support
*05:20.840- 05:27.080* :  for Ukraine in terms of providing it with weapons, but also about its future being inside the NATO
*05:27.080- 05:32.760* :  alliance. Of course, it's been clear that, whilst this war goes on, despite Ukraine's desire
*05:32.760- 05:37.140* :  to join NATO, it's not going to happen until the fighting stops.
*05:37.560- 05:39.720* :  And how disappointing is that for Ukraine?
*05:39.720- 05:45.300* :  You know, inevitably, Ukraine always comes to these NATO meetings with high hopes and leaves
*05:45.300- 05:51.800* :  slightly disappointed. I suspect it will leave slightly disappointed, but overall the message from
*05:51.800- 05:56.400* :  NATO is that they are fully behind Ukraine. I mean, it's not every single ally, of course,
*05:56.400- 06:00.400* :  Viktor Orb√°n from Hungary has been visiting President Putin, and there's a lot of criticism
*06:01.140- 06:06.920* :  from NATO allies of what he's been doing. But broadly speaking, there is a sense of unity,
*06:06.920- 06:12.780* :  but the elephant in the room here is what's going to happen in the US. I mean, they'll be all
*06:12.780- 06:19.140* :  lies on, first of all, Joe Biden on how he performs after his pretty disastrous presidential debate,
*06:19.140- 06:24.120* :  but I don't think they are addressing public. What could happen next? And they will not be entertaining
*06:24.120- 06:29.980* :  or discussing in public, although they all be thinking about it. What would they do if Donald
*06:29.980- 06:37.060* :  Trump, a known skeptic of providing military support, US military money to Ukraine, and also
*06:37.060- 06:42.680* :  the alliance itself, wins the second term. Those concerns are real here, even though they won't
*06:42.680- 06:48.280* :  be addressed in public. Jonathan Biel, while earlier on the podcast, we heard President Biden's
*06:48.280- 06:53.740* :  forcefully delivered message in contrast to his halting performance in the television debate
*06:53.740- 06:59.960* :  last week with Donald Trump, which caused huge concern among Democrats. Hakim Jeffries,
*06:59.960- 07:04.360* :  the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, has held a meeting with colleagues who remain
*07:04.360- 07:10.040* :  worried about President Biden's bid for the White House in November. The president has admitted
*07:10.040- 07:16.640* :  his performance at the debate was poor, but insists he is staying in the race. These voters had mixed
*07:16.640- 07:23.760* :  views. I feel he has done so much. I will support him out of loyalty, and I will vote
*07:23.760- 07:29.120* :  for him if he is on the ticket. I think you just have a side for sure. I'm a lifelong Democrat,
*07:29.120- 07:33.340* :  but I think at this point a hundred percent chance right now the Trump lands if he runs.
*07:33.940- 07:39.340* :  Our correspondent in Washington, Nomeh Ekbal, told me more about the meetings in which the Democrats
*07:39.340- 07:45.880* :  in Congress discussed Mr. Biden's future. You had the House Democrats and the Senate Democrats
*07:45.880- 07:51.180* :  meeting behind closed doors to talk about their concerns regarding President Biden's health.
*07:51.180- 07:56.300* :  Now the House Democrats have been much more vocal. You've got several members who have called
*07:56.300- 08:02.220* :  on President Biden to stand down, and many of them left the meeting, not saying much, but there
*08:02.220- 08:08.560* :  was from various reports with a team on the Capitol who said that the atmosphere wasn't great.
*08:08.560- 08:14.120* :  There are those who are still concerned. In terms of the Senate Democrats, there haven't been any
*08:14.120- 08:18.300* :  that have explicitly called for the President to stand down, but they're not really coalesced
*08:18.300- 08:25.580* :  around him either. So really where things stand is that the President is showing signs of a
*08:25.740- 08:32.000* :  political life again and a political fight back. I'm actually sat in the White House press briefing
*08:32.000- 08:37.860* :  room where the questions were asked once again about President Biden's health, the press secretary
*08:37.860- 08:43.260* :  doubled down and said that the President is going nowhere and the focus is very much on the big
*08:43.260- 08:49.360* :  NATO summit this week where the President is hosting world leaders, but everything he says,
*08:49.360- 08:55.720* :  everything he does is going to be hugely scrutinized. How long have they got before they can decide
*08:55.720- 09:01.640* :  whether to stick with him, President Biden, for the election in November, or they can decide to
*09:01.640- 09:05.940* :  try and change things? Well, we're talking about a matter of weeks to be honest, because the
*09:05.940- 09:13.160* :  Democratic National Convention is mid-August and by that point, he will be confirmed as the nominee,
*09:14.040- 09:19.660* :  but there have been talks about an open convention. Open conventions were once upon a time of
*09:19.700- 09:27.040* :  thing. They haven't been obviously used for a long time now, but the Democrats who are standing
*09:27.040- 09:32.900* :  by President Biden say that this would be too chaotic, that this wouldn't be the way to do things
*09:32.900- 09:39.860* :  and also President Biden has won the primaries and there are delegates who back him and it would
*09:39.860- 09:44.300* :  all become very, very complicated. Then there's a question of who would replace him, but the crucial
*09:44.300- 09:50.360* :  point here is that the only way the President can be replaced is if he stands down and he has made
*09:50.360- 09:55.000* :  it very clear that's not going to happen, you know, as far as the President's concerned and those
*09:55.000- 10:01.260* :  who support him, it's the case of the masses closed. At the press briefing today, the White House
*10:01.260- 10:06.200* :  press secretary said that those who are concerned about President Biden wanting to step aside,
*10:06.440- 10:10.500* :  those numbers are much smaller compared to those who still want him to run again.
*10:11.360- 10:17.460* :  Nomear Igbel in Washington. Now to Russia, where the crackdown on critics of the Kremlin continues,
*10:17.960- 10:23.280* :  a court in Moscow has issued an arrest warrant for Yulia Navalnya, the widow of the late Russian
*10:23.280- 10:30.300* :  opposition leader Alexei Navalny. After his suspicious death in an Arctic circle prison in February,
*10:30.300- 10:36.620* :  his wife took over as leader of his anti-corruption foundation, a designated extremist group in Russia.
*10:37.300- 10:42.960* :  Will Vernon has more. She's accused of carrying out crimes under the criminal code, so that's a
*10:42.960- 10:49.460* :  serious criminal offense in Russia and the charge is participation in an extremist group and she's
*10:49.460- 10:54.800* :  now been placed on the wanted list. Now, of course, Yulia Navalnya is not in Russia at the moment.
*10:54.800- 11:00.240* :  She is in the West. We don't know exactly where she's living, where she's residing at the moment,
*11:00.240- 11:05.940* :  for obvious reasons. She doesn't broadcast that, but she left Russia not long after her husband
*11:05.940- 11:11.900* :  was poisoned by Nova Chalk in 2020. After Alexei Navalnya died in February this year,
*11:11.900- 11:17.160* :  Yulia Navalnya got up in front of a whole full of delegates to the Munich Security Conference
*11:17.740- 11:24.400* :  and criticized the Russian authorities in general for being responsible for her husband's death.
*11:24.400- 11:27.760* :  But also pointing the finger directly at Vladimir Putin.
*11:28.400- 11:35.720* :  Will Vernon. Yulia Navalnya posted her response to the arrest warrant on the social media platform X.
*11:35.720- 11:42.220* :  Here it is, voiced by one of our journalists. When you write about this, please do not forget to
*11:42.220- 11:49.300* :  write the main thing. Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal. His place is in prison
*11:49.780- 11:56.000* :  and not somewhere in the Hague in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia, in the same colony
*11:56.580- 12:00.880* :  and the same two-by-three-meter cell in which he killed Alexei.
*12:01.240- 12:06.740* :  The words of Yulia Navalnya. Well, meanwhile, the wife of Vladimir Karamurtsa,
*12:06.740- 12:12.300* :  the jailed Russian opposition politician, says his lawyer has again been denied access to him.
*12:12.840- 12:17.900* :  Nothing has been heard from Mr. Karamurtsa since the Russian authorities said he'd been
*12:17.900- 12:25.260* :  transferred to hospital for an examination on July 4th. Vladimir Karamurtsa received a 25-year
*12:25.260- 12:30.820* :  prison sentence for treason last year after speaking out against President Putin and the war
*12:30.820- 12:38.920* :  in Ukraine. A political activist in Gaza has been beaten by armed men after speaking out against
*12:38.920- 12:45.140* :  the Hamas authorities there. I mean, Abed, a long time opponent of Hamas had just criticized
*12:45.140- 12:50.800* :  the group on social media. He recently spoke to television networks, including to the BBC.
*12:51.100- 12:57.040* :  Friends say all four of his limbs were broken in the attack. He's now recovering at hospital.
*12:57.680- 13:00.140* :  Here's our Middle East correspondent, Missy Williamson.
*13:01.060- 13:06.800* :  Already paying the price of war, Amin Abed was made to pay the price of protest.
*13:07.720- 13:10.640* :  Video footage taken just after yesterday's attack
*13:11.240- 13:15.980* :  shows him on the ground. Barely moving, his limbs marked by bloodied wounds.
*13:16.820- 13:22.720* :  Speaking exclusively to the BBC from his hospital bed, he said that five masked men with knives,
*13:22.720- 13:29.480* :  axes and pistols had kidnapped and beaten him, calling him a traitor and an agent for Israel.
*13:30.480- 13:35.640* :  Their leader told them to break my fingers to stop me writing anything against Hamas again,
*13:35.740- 13:42.340* :  he said. Friends told the BBC that the armed men were members of the Hamas internal security force
*13:43.060- 13:48.580* :  and that Amin's life was saved by local women who pushed through bursts of gunfire from his
*13:48.580- 13:57.940* :  attackers to make them stop. Afterwards, his father walked through the streets with a loud speaker
*13:57.940- 14:07.020* :  calling on Amin's attackers. Enough you cowards, he said. Did you win victory by kidnapping and
*14:07.020- 14:14.260* :  beating my son? Amin, an outspoken critic of Hamas for many years, has been arrested and beaten
*14:14.260- 14:20.780* :  before. This attack came days after television channels, including the BBC broadcast interviews
*14:20.780- 14:27.360* :  with him, and hours after he sharply criticized Hamas on social media, accusing the group of
*14:27.620- 14:33.020* :  kidnapping Gaza and clinging to power by fighting until the last child.
*14:33.940- 14:40.300* :  Lucy Williamson. The United Nations Human Rights Office says it's looking into reports of a mass grave
*14:40.300- 14:46.640* :  along the Libya Tunisia border. The High Commissioner Volkotuk said the responsibility for investigating
*14:46.640- 14:53.120* :  the alleged crimes falls squarely on Libya. In March this year, a mass grave was discovered in
*14:53.120- 15:00.060* :  southwestern Libya containing at least 65 bodies presumed to be migrants. As if this were not
*15:00.060- 15:05.220* :  horrific enough, we are following up on reports of another mass grave recently discovered
*15:05.700- 15:11.420* :  in the desert area at the Libyan Tunisian border. I urge the authorities to respond swiftly
*15:11.420- 15:18.500* :  to our inquiries and to investigate these crimes fully. Mr. Turk also called on the international
*15:18.500- 15:24.840* :  community to suspend cooperation on asylum and migration with authorities involved in human rights
*15:24.840- 15:31.000* :  violations. Both Libya and Tunisia are vital partners in the European Union's efforts to stem
*15:31.000- 15:36.280* :  the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean from North Africa into southern Europe.
*15:39.180- 15:43.320* :  You'll listen to the Global News podcast with me, Valerie Sanderson, still to come.
*15:43.320- 15:49.880* :  The actor Alec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter trial begins in New Mexico and

*16:41.740- 16:49.880* :  to Afghanistan by creating their own version of American Idol. The joy they brought to the nation.
*16:50.360- 16:55.480* :  You're free completely, no one is there to destroy you. The danger they endured.
*16:55.480- 17:01.820* :  It felt my head should be cut off. I'm John Legend. Listen to Afghan Star
*17:02.420- 17:05.660* :  on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcast.
*17:13.080- 17:18.640* :  It was an incident that rocked the film industry. Three years ago the actor Alec Baldwin was on
*17:18.640- 17:24.920* :  set for the film Rust. When the prop gun he was holding went off killing the cinematographer Helina
*17:24.920- 17:30.100* :  Hutchins. Now the trial of the Hollywood star has begun in the US state of New Mexico,
*17:30.660- 17:35.840* :  where he stands accused of involuntary manslaughter, a charge at Mr. Baldwin denies.
*17:36.360- 17:40.440* :  The actor declined to speak to reporters as he arrived in court in Santa Fe.
*17:48.180- 17:53.060* :  I spoke to our correspondent Emma Vardy as the proceedings got underway on Tuesday.
*17:53.680- 17:57.200* :  Jury selection had just got going and that's supposed to take the rest of today.
*17:57.260- 18:01.680* :  So of course that's that process where the prosecutors and defense get to question
*18:01.680- 18:05.920* :  a group of people and then they can pick their jury from that and they're essentially looking to
*18:05.920- 18:11.640* :  try to get people who can be fair and impartial. Now Mr. Baldwin he's sat in court today.
*18:11.640- 18:16.240* :  He's watching that process but really tomorrow is when things really kick off and that's when
*18:16.240- 18:20.980* :  the opening arguments will happen. Now the question that's at the heart of this case really is
*18:21.140- 18:26.480* :  did Mr. Baldwin act responsibly when he was handling that weapon? We know he said that the crew
*18:26.480- 18:31.860* :  told him the weapon was safe, much as you'd expect. The armourer who was responsible for handling
*18:31.860- 18:36.940* :  weapons on set, Hannah Gutierrez, she was previously already found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
*18:36.940- 18:41.080* :  So in that sense there is somebody else who can point the finger at and say look the armourer
*18:41.340- 18:46.640* :  was the person who made the big mistake in this case which was that she had mixed up a live bullets
*18:47.280- 18:52.600* :  with dummy rounds and that's why this gun then fired a live round causing the tragic death of
*18:52.600- 18:56.960* :  the cinematographer. But what the prosecution to say is that actually Alec Baldwin was responsible
*18:57.000- 19:01.820* :  too. They say that you should never point a gun at somebody those are basic safety rules with
*19:01.820- 19:05.540* :  a gun. You should never point a gun at someone and pull the trigger unless you're intending to kill
*19:05.580- 19:10.780* :  them and they say that it was Hannah Gutierrez mistake. The armourer was one part of this but the
*19:10.780- 19:15.240* :  other part of it was that Alec Baldwin himself wasn't following safety rules and that he should also
*19:15.240- 19:20.000* :  share some of the responsibility. Now this incident happened three years ago, didn't it? What
*19:20.000- 19:25.800* :  has Alec Baldwin been doing since then? Well what we know from some court documents previously is
*19:25.800- 19:30.400* :  that he said he's found things very difficult, that he's struggled to find acting work since then.
*19:30.400- 19:35.420* :  He has just signed up to do a reality series with him and his family. Clearly he has some
*19:35.420- 19:40.620* :  intentions that he will be a free man after this trial but we'll have to wait and see the outcome
*19:40.620- 19:44.900* :  of it but clearly life has been made extremely difficult for him with this hanging over him because
*19:45.420- 19:49.720* :  this shooting at the time it shocked the film industry, it's made many many headlines.
*19:50.260- 19:55.420* :  Lots of people speculating on whether it was right to bring him to trial, whether he should he is
*19:55.420- 19:59.880* :  or isn't responsible. And Alec Baldwin himself gave a couple of interviews after the incident,
*19:59.880- 20:04.440* :  trying to set out his defence case really and saying that he didn't pull the trigger, that it's
*20:04.440- 20:08.800* :  the responsibility of crew members, particularly the armourer of course, so hand weapons to actors
*20:08.800- 20:13.600* :  and make sure they're safe. But you can imagine life has been extremely difficult because of
*20:13.600- 20:17.660* :  course people make up their own judgments in the court of public opinion and as an actor looking
*20:17.660- 20:23.100* :  to find work it's clearly affected his career so far so he's going to be hoping that this is the
*20:23.100- 20:26.420* :  end of this at this trial but we'll have to wait and see what the jury make of the evidence.
*20:27.100- 20:33.480* :  M.A.V.R.D. Almost 230 million girls and women around the world, more than half of them in Africa,
*20:33.480- 20:39.480* :  have undergone some form of female genital mutilation. That's the partial or total removal
*20:39.560- 20:43.840* :  of external female genital organs for non-medical reasons.
*20:44.780- 20:50.520* :  Shamsa Sharawi and Haja Bilkisu had corrective surgery in Europe to repair the physical damage
*20:50.520- 20:55.480* :  done to them as children but the procedure isn't available in most African countries.
*20:55.980- 21:01.980* :  Now the BBC's Bhusha Muhammad has met Shamsa and Haja and spoken to them both about their experiences.
*21:02.660- 21:06.240* :  A warning this report contains details which you may find upsetting.
*21:07.260- 21:12.320* :  This is my mom, that's my sister and that's me.
*21:12.520- 21:18.140* :  Shamsa Sharawi had that when her old British Somali sits cross-legged on her bed,
*21:18.900- 21:22.440* :  she is swiping through old photos of herself on the phone.
*21:22.740- 21:26.140* :  We are applying for a visa to come to the UK.
*21:26.960- 21:30.980* :  Looking through childhood photos brings a painful memory for Shamsa.
*21:31.640- 21:38.680* :  At just six years of age when living in Somalia, she became a victim of female genital mutilation.
*21:38.680- 21:42.640* :  She was pinned down by family members as her clutrious,
*21:43.020- 21:47.500* :  vulva, alabia, wakat and then she was soan shut.
*21:47.500- 21:53.200* :  I had chronic pain. I was not able to wear underwear or trousers.
*21:53.560- 21:57.580* :  I was not able to walk comfortably or sit comfortably.
*21:57.860- 22:02.220* :  Then I just got to a point where my mental health was really deteriorating.
*22:05.760- 22:09.120* :  Shamsa now walks through his awareness on the dangers of FGM.
*22:10.260- 22:14.880* :  Walking through her local pack, she told me about the decision to end the
*22:14.900- 22:17.800* :  gory constructive surgery two decades later.
*22:19.280- 22:24.220* :  The idea of the cut again was daunting to say the least.
*22:24.260- 22:31.780* :  I was absolutely terrified but I knew in order for me to live comfortably in my body,
*22:32.240- 22:34.080* :  I had to have this surgery.
*22:34.760- 22:38.900* :  Despite raising tens of thousands of dollars to cover the surgery in Germany,
*22:39.580- 22:40.660* :  she is still in debt.
*22:41.540- 22:48.880* :  It's crippling knowing that you are now in debt for something you did not do to yourself
*22:50.180- 22:53.460* :  for a crime that was done against you and you have to not carry.
*22:54.480- 22:57.540* :  That load is very tough.
*22:58.200- 23:03.980* :  Shamsa is not alone in her experience. Over 800 kilometers away in Germany,
*23:04.740- 23:10.820* :  30-year-old Serillionian had Jabil Kisu also opted for surgery three years ago.
*23:11.520- 23:18.500* :  She was cut when she was 80 years old in a hospital and the anesthesia and doesn't recall the
*23:18.500- 23:24.900* :  experience. I always felt like I'm a visitor in my own body and this body doesn't belong to me
*23:24.900- 23:26.420* :  because it was taken away from me.
*23:28.180- 23:32.740* :  The site didn't cost her much because it was done under Germany's public health care system.
*23:32.740- 23:38.320* :  She did, however, have to undergo several procedures to get the result she hoped for.
*23:38.660- 23:43.260* :  I couldn't walk properly for two or three weeks. I couldn't lay down on my side for two or three
*23:43.260- 23:50.780* :  weeks and emotionally and mentally I think that's the most challenging part because after a surgery
*23:50.780- 23:54.520* :  like that you are basically retraumatized.
*23:55.060- 24:02.040* :  The procedure is only available in a few African countries such as Kenya where women must pay
*24:02.040- 24:08.580* :  out of their own pockets and in Egypt where nine governmental organizations may sometimes help with
*24:08.580- 24:15.020* :  the costs. Dr. Rahim Awad based in Cairo, Egypt is one of the few reconstructive surgeons in Africa.
*24:15.620- 24:24.560* :  I always explain to my patients that we can never remake or restore everything as it was originally
*24:24.560- 24:30.440* :  because it's not just about the physical aspects that have been removed but it's also about
*24:30.440- 24:37.880* :  restoring that woman's self-confidence and overcome the trauma of what she went through.
*24:38.120- 24:43.740* :  In Africa alone more than 140 million women and girls have undergone FGM.
*24:45.340- 24:49.820* :  Now in recovery both Shamsa and Hadja say they are happy with their decisions.
*24:51.660- 25:01.520* :  I feel for the first time in my life normality and for a survivor of FGM I have never felt normality.
*25:02.000- 25:07.020* :  But they both believe it is not a decision they would recommend without serious thoughts
*25:07.020- 25:10.860* :  on their risks involved. Bushra Muhammad
*25:12.180- 25:16.740* :  It is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and many people are looking forward to holidays abroad.
*25:17.360- 25:21.580* :  Sunbathing, sightseeing and swimming are favourites on the holiday activity list.
*25:22.020- 25:27.840* :  But what about picking up litter? Well the tourism boards in Denmark's capital Copenhagen
*25:27.840- 25:32.800* :  are trialing a scheme to encourage greener tourism where visitors can air and
*25:32.800- 25:38.660* :  cope and pay points for taking part in sustainable activities. In turn they qualify for free
*25:38.660- 25:43.380* :  cultural visits and even food and drink. Paul Henley spoke to the director of the scheme
*25:43.380- 25:49.160* :  Ricker Home Peterson. We have big ambitions for a sustainable transition of our destination
*25:49.260- 25:54.500* :  they're coming years and of course that's a big task and one of the things we really want to
*25:54.500- 26:01.700* :  is turning tourism from being an environmental burden into a force for positive change and data
*26:01.700- 26:09.060* :  actually shows that 82% say they want to access sustainably but only 22% have changed their
*26:09.060- 26:15.920* :  behavior. So one of the reasons why we started this trial was actually diminishing this big gap
*26:15.960- 26:21.400* :  so we want to change the mindset and actions of tourists and notch them towards more green choices.
*26:21.780- 26:26.480* :  So one of the things they can do they can collect waste plastic waste and then they are being
*26:26.480- 26:32.300* :  invited to workshop to turn it into art. They can go to a place called Oonshaer which is the
*26:32.300- 26:37.060* :  largest urban farm in northern Europe and then they can work in the garden and earn a free
*26:37.060- 26:43.220* :  vegetarian lunch with Copenhagen. So there are many different things you can do and also many
*26:43.220- 26:48.960* :  different awards. Does it involve a lot of trust? Can someone turn up and say I've been riding
*26:48.960- 26:53.800* :  around the city on a bike so can I have my free entry to this tourist attraction? How will the
*26:53.840- 27:00.880* :  people know? The system in itself is based on trust that we decided on very quickly because the
*27:00.880- 27:07.500* :  Denmark is the society of trust. So participation is quite simple in some of the attraction you show
*27:07.500- 27:12.660* :  proof of your green actions and that could be a train ticket door by similar whatever it is
*27:13.060- 27:18.500* :  and in other places they won't ask for it so it differs a bit. It's not everybody's idea of a
*27:18.500- 27:23.680* :  holiday highlight picking up plastic litter but you're optimistic it'll catch on.
*27:24.460- 27:29.780* :  Yes for sure because imagine when you go and vacate yourself you normally do your normal things
*27:29.780- 27:35.500* :  you go to museum or you go to places. Now you're actually being presented for something different.
*27:35.500- 27:41.140* :  Now you can actually go on a free kayak tour and collect waste. I mean where can you do that and
*27:41.140- 27:46.140* :  you can do it for free or you can go to an urban farm and work there a couple of hours and get a
*27:46.140- 27:51.940* :  free meal. I would actually say you enrich your holiday by doing this so you get a lot more out
*27:51.940- 27:56.180* :  of your holiday and you get some other experiences than what you would normally do.
*27:57.080- 28:03.160* :  Ricker home Peterson. And finally the European Space Agency's much anticipated
*28:03.200- 28:10.380* :  Aryan 6 rocket has taken off from French Guyana on its virgin flight. This is the moment the rocket
*28:10.380- 28:17.980* :  launched. 3, 2, 1, top. Alima, you have two stars from college.
*28:24.180- 28:30.160* :  That was left off well at a cost of more than four billion dollars. The rocket is intended to give
*28:30.160- 28:35.660* :  European governments and companies access to space independently from the rest of the world
*28:35.660- 28:42.700* :  and is seen as the biggest competitor to Elon Musk's space X. Dr. Semen Barber is a space scientist
*28:42.700- 28:48.500* :  at the Open University. The first launch of any new rocket is always the trickiest one.
*28:48.500- 28:54.980* :  It's the one where your heart is beating as fast as it gets and it was definitely an exciting
*28:54.980- 28:59.280* :  one this evening and as far as we've seen everything seems to be going okay so far.
*28:59.660- 29:05.060* :  And why is this rocket so important? This is really important rocket for Europe really.
*29:05.060- 29:11.420* :  Its predecessor had done 115 successful missions out of 117 so it had been a really good
*29:11.960- 29:17.260* :  workhorse launcher for European spacecraft and for space instruments that the time developed
*29:17.260- 29:21.900* :  at the Open University but times change and you've got to move on to the next model and
*29:22.580- 29:28.600* :  its predecessor retired a year ago and we had no launch capability in Europe and now we have one
*29:28.600- 29:33.060* :  again so it's building that capability to put payloads into space for the future.
*29:33.680- 29:38.180* :  And what will it be used for primarily? This will be used for all sorts of satellites to go
*29:38.400- 29:43.800* :  either orbiting the earth maybe looking taking images high resolution images doing telecommunications
*29:43.980- 29:48.540* :  you know making mobile phones work studying the weather and it will also be used to send
*29:48.540- 29:54.660* :  spacecraft into space so missions to the moon for instance. And Elon Musk has already
*29:54.660- 30:01.820* :  criticised the company hasn't he? Is that because it's seen as a big competitor to his space X?
*30:02.200- 30:08.380* :  Certainly space launching is you know becoming a very competitive business and one of the key
*30:08.380- 30:14.600* :  characteristics of what space X do is that they're aiming for almost fully reusable spacecraft.
*30:14.600- 30:21.240* :  Ariane 6 has some reusable elements but not all of it so it may not be a sustainable in the future
*30:21.240- 30:27.440* :  in the long term so you know the question will be can it capture a market and do do launches
*30:27.440- 30:32.640* :  reliably but also cost effectively because there's a lot more competition in the space launching
*30:32.640- 30:38.000* :  market now and I was saying maybe 10 years ago and this was being planned. And what does it tell us
*30:38.000- 30:43.060* :  about the future of the European Space Agency? I think European Space Agency wants to have its own
*30:43.060- 30:47.520* :  access to space and that benefits Europe as a whole and you know the investment that goes into
*30:47.520- 30:53.920* :  that is is returned into you know European economies it's able to compete on the global market again
*30:54.220- 30:58.540* :  time will tell just how competitive this generation of space craft will be.
*30:59.340- 31:05.660* :  Dr. Simeon Barber and that's it from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the global
*31:05.660- 31:11.540* :  news podcast later if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it send us an
