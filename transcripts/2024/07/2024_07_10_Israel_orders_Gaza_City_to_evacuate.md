*01:27.780- 01:34.020* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Jackie Leonard and at 13 hours GMT
*01:34.020- 01:39.840* :  on Wednesday 10th July, these are our main stories. Israel's told all residents of Gaza City to
*01:39.840- 01:43.720* :  evacuate. It'll be the second time they've had to leave the biggest city in the territory.
*01:43.720- 01:49.280* :  Meanwhile, indirect talks on the conflict are assuming in Qatar. NATO leaders continue their summit
*01:49.280- 01:54.640* :  in Washington with the defence of Ukraine again at the top of the agenda. And the trial begins in
*01:54.640- 02:01.580* :  Australia of 14 members of a religious sect accused of denying medication to a diabetic eight-year-old
*02:01.820- 02:09.860* :  who then died. Also in this podcast, Joe Biden's fended off mounting calls to step down as the
*02:09.860- 02:15.060* :  Democrat nominee. Joe Biden has indicated he is going to run and I'm glad he is. He's going to
*02:15.060- 02:19.520* :  continue to run. He and Vice President Harris can beat Donald Trump and they'll do it again.
*02:20.000- 02:23.520* :  And another joke from the Simpsons TV show is coming true.
*02:28.740- 02:33.980* :  The Israeli military dropped leaflets over Gaza City on Wednesday telling all residents to
*02:33.980- 02:39.020* :  evacuate and head towards the centre of the territory. It's the second time people have been
*02:39.020- 02:43.940* :  told to flee the city since the start of the conflict. The leaflets warn that the city's about
*02:43.940- 02:48.900* :  to become a dangerous combat zone and give instructions on safe evacuation routes.
*02:49.480- 02:54.400* :  Our strikes continue in southern Gaza. These women and children were among those
*02:54.400- 03:00.060* :  sheltering at a school in Khan Yunus before it was hit by an air strike on Tuesday killing at least
*03:00.060- 03:09.220* :  29 people. We were just sitting. Nothing was going on. Everything was normal. There was no
*03:09.220- 03:14.320* :  sounds of planes or anything. There were a group of women and men sat over there and suddenly a
*03:14.320- 03:21.560* :  rocket fell. There were injuries and deaths. They were sitting there looking at their phones
*03:21.740- 03:27.360* :  and suddenly they were hit with no warning or anything. We found them scattered all over the
*03:27.360- 03:33.940* :  place. We've been destroyed. There is no more life. Israel says that strike was targeted at a
*03:33.940- 03:39.660* :  member of Hamas who took part in the October the 7th attacks. The Israeli defence minister,
*03:39.660- 03:43.280* :  Yohav Galant says their aim to eliminate Hamas is well underway.
*03:47.360- 03:52.640* :  We've eliminated or wounded 60 percent of the Hamas terrorists. We've disbanded 24
*03:52.640- 03:59.220* :  battalions or the vast majority of them. We've returned half of the hostages and we are determined
*03:59.220- 04:05.000* :  to retrieve the rest. And all of us, the security establishment and myself heading it,
*04:05.500- 04:08.980* :  are determined to achieve the goals of the war and complete them.
*04:11.000- 04:16.840* :  All of this comes as indirect talks on a ceasefire take place in Qatar. Our correspondent Nick
*04:16.840- 04:22.000* :  Beak is in Jerusalem and told us about this latest evacuation order. We know that this is something
*04:22.000- 04:27.780* :  the Israeli army has used in the course of the past nine months to signal that an operation
*04:28.280- 04:32.720* :  is either imminent or we will be coming in the days and weeks to come. And we've been in touch
*04:32.720- 04:39.100* :  with people in Gaza City itself today and they've confirmed that they've received these messages,
*04:39.100- 04:43.440* :  these letters that have been dropped from the sky. And just looking at what's said on it,
*04:43.820- 04:48.980* :  it's addressed to the all the residents of Gaza City. So everyone it would seem. And the messages
*04:48.980- 04:54.860* :  that there are safe corridors, according to the Israelis, where people can leave Gaza City. They
*04:54.860- 05:00.160* :  won't be checks and there are a number of places they're told to go to. There's also streets,
*05:00.160- 05:06.180* :  marked where people are told they'll receive safe passage. And the final message is that
*05:06.180- 05:11.880* :  Gaza City remains a dangerous fighting zone. So the Israelis saying today that Palestinians in
*05:11.880- 05:17.760* :  Gaza City should leave, of course, the criticism will be. And it has been over the course of the
*05:17.760- 05:23.840* :  past nine months that these sort of evacuation zones and routes are not safe. And they're enumerous
*05:24.060- 05:28.380* :  accusations leveled at the Israelis that people have been killed or seriously injured trying to
*05:28.380- 05:32.400* :  make this perilous journey from one place where they've been told to leave. And meanwhile,
*05:32.400- 05:36.800* :  ceasefire talks are getting underway in Qatar. Yes, that's right. There was youm today in Qatar.
*05:36.800- 05:43.100* :  You've got the spy chiefs from America, from Israel, Egypt, also meeting the Cassary Prime Minister.
*05:43.460- 05:49.300* :  And the hope is that this is moving towards some sort of ceasefire in Gaza with the release of some
*05:49.300- 05:55.280* :  of the hostages taken on October 7th by Hamas. No indication of how the talks are going so far.
*05:55.280- 06:00.280* :  The BBC has got confirmation that they have resumed. The White House has indicated it's
*06:00.300- 06:06.540* :  cautiously optimistic that some of the gaps can be closed, but no sign of any sort of imminent
*06:06.540- 06:12.340* :  breakthrough at the moment. That was Nick Beak in Jerusalem. It's day two of the three-day NATO
*06:12.340- 06:17.780* :  conference in Washington, D.C. marking 75 years since the military alliance was formed.
*06:18.200- 06:22.740* :  Addressing world leaders, President Biden describes the grouping as the greatest defense
*06:22.740- 06:28.520* :  alliance in the world, and he used his address to promise five more air defense systems for Ukraine.
*06:29.340- 06:32.380* :  Unorth America correspondent Tom Bateman listened to the speech.
*06:36.140- 06:41.240* :  Reaching the stage with an orchestral introduction in the same hall where NATO's founding treaty
*06:41.240- 06:48.660* :  was signed in 1949, Mr. Biden vowed resolve in Europe's modern war, saying Ukraine would win
*06:48.660- 06:54.780* :  against Russia. He pledged more air defense equipment for the country and took credit for NATO's
*06:54.780- 07:00.600* :  expansion and increased defense spending. The alliance he said was now stronger than ever,
*07:01.240- 07:06.260* :  but that wasn't guaranteed. This is a pivotal moment for Europe for the transatlantic community,
*07:07.120- 07:11.820* :  and I might add for the world. The fact that NATO remains the bulwark of global security did not
*07:11.820- 07:18.660* :  happen by accident. It wasn't inevitable, again and again, at critical moments. We chose unity
*07:18.660- 07:26.020* :  over disunion, freedom over turning, hope over fear, again and again, we stood behind our shared
*07:26.020- 07:31.360* :  vision of a peaceful and prosperous transatlantic community. Mr. Biden invoked the memory of Ronald
*07:31.360- 07:37.500* :  Reagan, a clear message meant to appeal to Republicans and exposed the dangers as he sees them
*07:37.760- 07:43.740* :  posed by Donald Trump, who has brought NATO skeptic messages back to the election campaign trail.
*07:44.500- 07:49.400* :  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is at the summit. He made clear he hoped that there'd be
*07:49.400- 07:55.200* :  a clear timetable for Ukraine to join the military alliance. He also urged allies to go further
*07:55.200- 08:01.240* :  and provide Ukraine more aircraft, including F-16s. Ukraine correspondent is James Waterhouse.
*08:01.760- 08:07.900* :  President Zelensky, with the events in key of notably this week with these devastating Russian
*08:07.900- 08:13.660* :  missile strikes, had been calling for 10 American-made patriot air defense systems.
*08:14.280- 08:20.980* :  They're incredibly sophisticated pieces of weaponry, which are capable of intercepting
*08:21.660- 08:28.220* :  hypersonic Russian missiles. Now, five have been announced by President Biden. We've also had
*08:28.220- 08:35.860* :  a statement saying that Ukraine's membership to NATO is irreversible, but I think these kind of
*08:36.140- 08:43.540* :  beamens and statements are the best President Zelensky can hope for as long as Russia continues to
*08:43.540- 08:49.820* :  invade his country. In President Zelensky's ideal world, Ukraine will be announced as the
*08:49.820- 08:55.760* :  third-fair member of NATO. Article 5 would be enacted, collective defense, and NATO would
*08:55.760- 09:00.300* :  send soldiers to Ukraine and fend off the Russians. Now, of course, that's not going to happen,
*09:00.300- 09:06.380* :  not least, because the West is still incredibly anxious of the war Ukraine turning into a world war.
*09:06.480- 09:10.560* :  So this is kind of the next best thing, but I think the language of the Ukrainian foreign
*09:10.560- 09:16.220* :  minister, Dimitra Kulibba, is interesting, where he is talking about seeking assurances and
*09:16.220- 09:22.700* :  weaponry from the U.S. as opposed to the NATO alliance itself. These kind of things are important,
*09:22.700- 09:27.700* :  politically, for Ukraine and its continued war effort, but I think there is a bit of private
*09:28.420- 09:33.300* :  frustration, and I think there is a degree of expectation, limited expectation on the
*09:33.300- 09:38.200* :  key of society, certainly. Now, obviously, there's still shock over the attack on a children's
*09:38.200- 09:44.700* :  hospital in Kiev on Monday. What's going on with the rescue effort? I think now that the operation
*09:44.700- 09:51.620* :  has gone from rescue to recovery. We were there yesterday, and we were meeting some of the patients
*09:51.660- 09:59.800* :  who have been relocated to other hospitals, and the sheer horror they describe. We met a 16-year-old
*09:59.800- 10:05.620* :  girl who was receiving dialysis. She was already wheelchair-bounded before the strike. She couldn't
*10:05.620- 10:11.880* :  get to the air-h shelter with her mother in the basement, and her mother emerged to find a huge
*10:11.880- 10:16.640* :  gaping hole in the building with smoke billowing out, and she didn't know where her daughter was.
*10:16.640- 10:23.440* :  She could see bodies around. She feared the worst. They were eventually reunited, but it was a
*10:23.440- 10:30.840* :  searing snapshot into the horror felt by those patients on that sunny morning, and I think these are
*10:30.840- 10:36.480* :  sort of these emotive illustrations of how this invasion doesn't tend to discriminate when it comes
*10:36.480- 10:42.260* :  to missiles falling from the sky. That was James Waterhouse in Kiev. To Australia now, where members
*10:42.260- 10:48.600* :  of a religious sect have gone on trial, accused of denying medication to a diabetic eight-year-old
*10:48.880- 10:54.980* :  who then died. The 14 members of the group known as the Saints allegedly prayed to God to cure
*10:54.980- 11:01.940* :  Elizabeth Strue's Type I diabetes rather than allowing her to receive insulin. She died in January
*11:01.940- 11:08.780* :  2022. Due to the complexity of the case, the trial will be conducted by a judge without a jury.
*11:09.460- 11:12.480* :  Simon Atkinson spoke to us from outside the courthouse in Brisbane.
*11:12.980- 11:17.960* :  The 14 defendants are all members of a religious group that was based in the town of Tuumbo,
*11:17.960- 11:24.720* :  which is about 125 kilometres west of Brisbane here in Queensland. A very small group,
*11:24.740- 11:28.840* :  they call themselves the Saints. They had formed as a kind of a splinter group from another church
*11:28.840- 11:34.240* :  a few years ago. Two of the defendants have been charged with murder. They include the father
*11:34.540- 11:41.180* :  of Elizabeth Strue's, Jason Strue's and also the leader of the religious group, Brendan Stevens.
*11:41.180- 11:45.640* :  They're both charged with murder. Charged with manslaughter are Elizabeth Strue's mother,
*11:45.640- 11:52.640* :  Kerry and her brother Zachary and ten others aged between 22 and 67, all members of the church.
*11:52.640- 11:57.860* :  They too are accused of manslaughter. They came into court today. They were quite smiley.
*11:57.860- 12:03.080* :  They were joking with one another. They certainly didn't seem to be displaying any signs of tension.
*12:03.160- 12:06.840* :  There was smiles through some of their supporters in the public gallery as well.
*12:06.840- 12:12.360* :  They all opted not to enter any plea, which the court then entered as a not guilty plea.
*12:12.360- 12:16.640* :  They're all representing themselves. They haven't got a lawyer who's presented
*12:17.100- 12:20.900* :  what their argument is going to be as yet. All we've heard so far in the case is an outline
*12:20.900- 12:26.480* :  of the prosecution. What does the prosecution say? Well, what we've heard from the prosecution
*12:26.480- 12:32.360* :  is that Elizabeth Strue's was an eight-year-old girl with diabetes and the allegation is
*12:32.360- 12:38.060* :  that she'd been denied her insulin for several days, that she'd eventually been unconscious
*12:38.060- 12:43.820* :  and had been left to die. And what the prosecutors say is that the extreme beliefs of this religious
*12:43.820- 12:48.020* :  group, they didn't believe that medicine work, that didn't believe in the use of doctors,
*12:48.540- 12:53.020* :  they thought that God would heal their daughter. So they left Elizabeth and she died a few days
*12:53.020- 12:58.960* :  after the insulin was withdrawn. What we also learned from the prosecutors is that we will hear
*12:58.960- 13:04.360* :  evidence that in 2019 Elizabeth was taken to hospital in a very serious condition, again,
*13:04.360- 13:10.000* :  having been denied insulin. In that case, the mother was prosecuted and convicted of neglect.
*13:10.000- 13:15.400* :  And so what the prosecution is trying to set out is this was a habitual behavior and that the
*13:15.400- 13:21.400* :  parents knew that the impact of taking away the insulin from their daughter was that it would
*13:21.400- 13:26.360* :  severely damage her health and ultimately she would die. Simon Atkinson in Brisbane,
*13:27.080- 13:31.900* :  it would be pretty disconcerting to find that any hygiene product contained toxic metals,
*13:32.560- 13:37.060* :  but there's been particular alarm at the discovery that tampons have traces of lead
*13:37.060- 13:43.320* :  mercury arsenic and other potentially dangerous substances. The research led by scientists
*13:43.320- 13:49.760* :  in California and New York looks at more than a dozen tampon brands. Stephanie Zacherson reports.
*13:50.440- 13:55.860* :  The study tests the 30 types of tampons from 14 different brands, or widely available in the US,
*13:55.860- 14:03.240* :  UK, or the EU. The researchers chose 16 metals to check whether the tampons contained any of them.
*14:03.400- 14:09.540* :  The findings were in a hundred percent of the samples, so this shows a systematic problem.
*14:09.780- 14:16.240* :  Dr. Mariante Anakio-Motjolo is a co-author of the report and associate professor at Columbia University.
*14:16.900- 14:22.980* :  The team found several toxic metals, some insignificant concentrations, such as cadmium,
*14:22.980- 14:29.080* :  lead and arsenic. Some of those discoveries are particularly concerning. If lead leaches into the
*14:29.080- 14:35.420* :  body, it can deposit itself in bones, staying in the body for a long time, even low levels of lead
*14:35.420- 14:41.140* :  are known to have a toxic impact on neurological health and behaviour, as well as on reproductive and
*14:41.140- 14:46.800* :  cardiovascular health. Now you might think that a product that is used inside the body would have
*14:46.800- 14:52.640* :  been checked for potentially toxic substances, but Dr. Kier-Motjolo says that is not the case.
*14:52.640- 15:00.800* :  We all assume they are safe. However, they have not been tested. We have really no idea,
*15:00.800- 15:08.220* :  and this is the first step, and I think this is what it is, is a cry for more testing for
*15:08.220- 15:13.520* :  these products that we use daily. More research is needed, but even that has been hard.
*15:13.520- 15:19.480* :  Dr. Kier-Motjolo says it took at 10 years to get the funding for this study. Now they're looking at
*15:19.480- 15:24.200* :  whether the metals in the tampons are released when they're used and absorbed by the body,
*15:24.720- 15:30.420* :  because when we consume toxins through food or drink, our liver normally takes care of getting rid
*15:30.420- 15:35.620* :  of them. But when they enter through a tampon, they bypass the liver and could potentially go
*15:35.620- 15:42.120* :  straight into the bloodstream. Mentioning people, menstruates, you know, once a month, and some people
*15:42.120- 15:49.040* :  wear up to five, maybe six tampons a day, depending on their flow. But we do not yet have any of
*15:49.040- 15:55.160* :  these answers. For now, Dr. Kier-Motjolo has taken a decision herself to use other alternatives.
*15:55.540- 15:59.500* :  I stopped wearing tampons and I'm wearing a menstrual cup.
*15:59.700- 16:05.180* :  Another question is how the metals have made their way into the products. Most tampons contain
*16:05.180- 16:11.300* :  cotton, which could have absorbed substances from water or soil, or it could be explained by the
*16:11.300- 16:16.480* :  production process. What the researchers are calling for is that there should be more regulations
*16:16.700- 16:23.520* :  and transparency around what's in products that are used by millions of people on a regular
*16:23.520- 16:31.740* :  basis. That report by Stephanie Zacherson. Still to come. It's just going to be so epic. When you
*16:31.740- 16:37.960* :  think that this was sort of predicted in the 90s, it's really incredible to think it's actually happening.
*16:38.480- 16:42.260* :  28 years on, another joke from The Simpsons is coming true.
*16:51.680- 16:58.660* :  This is the story of how a group of people brought music back to Afghanistan by creating their own
*16:58.660- 17:06.300* :  version of American Idol. The joy they brought to the nation. You're free completely. No one is
*17:06.300- 17:12.060* :  there to destroy you. The danger they endured. It felt my head should be cut off.
*17:12.880- 17:19.540* :  I'm John Legend. Listen to Afghan Star on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcast.
*17:25.780- 17:31.400* :  In Sudan, Civil War, the city of El Fashar remains an important prize. It's the Sudanese
*17:31.400- 17:36.360* :  military's last foothold in the western region of Darfur, and it's in the grip of a punishing
*17:36.540- 17:43.860* :  battle between the army and the paramilitary rapid support forces or RSF. A local cameraman,
*17:43.860- 17:49.660* :  Mohammed Zakaria, has been sending the BBC footage from the besieged city. But at the beginning
*17:49.660- 17:55.540* :  of June, he decided it was too dangerous to stay. This is the story about his journey out of the
*17:55.540- 18:02.640* :  country through RSF held territory as told to Barbara Pletasha. Mohammed's family had left weeks
*18:02.640- 18:09.300* :  earlier. He stayed behind to work. But that was becoming impossible. It was risky to stay,
*18:09.300- 18:14.500* :  but also risky to leave. Still, he decided to flee to South Sudan.
*18:17.400- 18:22.460* :  First, Mohammed got on a donkey cart in a nearby refugee camp to leave his camera equipment with
*18:22.460- 18:28.940* :  a friend there. But he took with him precious records of photographs and videos stored on memory
*18:28.940- 18:35.740* :  cards and external hard drives. The big problem I faced in the road, how I can hide these things,
*18:36.220- 18:42.380* :  because this is a dangerous thing. If RSF or any sort of seat, you can't disappear.
*18:47.600- 18:52.240* :  Mohammed entered territory held by the rapid support forces shortly after leaving the refugee
*18:52.240- 18:58.860* :  camp. He joined a convoy of other travelers. The danger was getting picked up by the RSF.
*18:59.700- 19:06.440* :  We paid to the RSF soldiers to go with us because the road is very dangerous. If you need to arrive
*19:06.440- 19:12.060* :  terribly, you need to pay to RSF. He hid his memory cards in a piece of paper that he put with other
*19:12.060- 19:17.140* :  documents. He'd also wiped his phone clear, getting rid of evidence that he'd been covering the
*19:17.140- 19:24.120* :  war in Elfashar. The account had posts like this.
*19:29.120- 19:32.760* :  Footage of children in Elfashar Hospital and of the bombing.
*19:33.720- 19:37.440* :  An RSF soldier discovered it at a checkpoint in the city of El Dane.
*19:42.500- 19:47.220* :  Mohammed was detained and interrogated. He said he was threatened with torture and death,
*19:47.220- 19:50.440* :  unless he disclosed the information he was accused of hiding.
*19:50.880- 19:55.460* :  So how did you feel, Moe, during this time? I mean, you were with him for what, four or five
*19:55.460- 20:02.940* :  hours? I feel lost. I don't believe now. I'm here. You feel like you are in a very bad situation.
*20:03.020- 20:08.520* :  If he wants to kill you, no one will know. This was the scariest part of the trip.
*20:09.080- 20:14.240* :  Mohammed managed to buy his freedom with a large sum of money. He was now very anxious to get
*20:14.240- 20:18.560* :  to South Sudan as quickly as possible. Instead, there was this.
*20:21.960- 20:25.940* :  Mohammed had squeezed onto the roof of a pickup truck crowded with other travelers,
*20:26.760- 20:32.100* :  but they got stuck in a forest because of heavy rains, then delayed by engine trouble and
*20:32.100- 20:38.760* :  fuel shortages for five days. The fair is there. We don't have a problem because we have
*20:39.060- 20:46.060* :  a little food with us. And the next two days, just deaths and water. Water from the rain from
*20:46.060- 20:51.500* :  the ground. We drink the water from the ground. At last, they made it to the town just before the
*20:51.500- 20:57.420* :  border, El Regabat. But then someone reported them, said they were from a tribe that fights with
*20:57.420- 21:04.400* :  the army against the RSF. The next day in the morning, RSF come to us to take all of us to the
*21:04.620- 21:10.660* :  to the office. There were more interrogations and one final payment for safe passage. Finally,
*21:10.660- 21:20.140* :  Mohammed crossed into South Sudan. I feel I'm alive. I really don't believe that. I'm
*21:20.140- 21:26.260* :  alive. I'm here and I made it. I reached to South Sudan with all my data and all my
*21:26.300- 21:34.720* :  love to my ex-tenors and I cross with much of RSF. Really. Unbelievable. Yeah, unbelievable.
*21:35.880- 21:40.440* :  Sudanese photojournalist Mohammed Zakaria, speaking to our Africa correspondent, Barbara
*21:40.440- 21:46.960* :  Pletasha. President Biden's re-election campaign has been on increasingly shaky ground since his
*21:46.960- 21:51.860* :  stumbling debate performance against Donald Trump a week and a half ago. He, however,
*21:51.860- 21:56.740* :  insists he's in good shape and has no intention of pulling out of the race. Following several
*21:56.740- 22:02.540* :  meetings on Tuesday, top Democrats in Congress, indicated that they were unwilling to withdraw
*22:02.540- 22:08.480* :  their support at least for now. One of them backing Mr. Biden to stay the course is Congresswoman
*22:08.480- 22:14.600* :  Barbara Lee of California. You can't sugarcoat the debate. It was a horrible debate and everyone
*22:14.600- 22:21.700* :  knows that and the president has admitted that. But that does not mean that he won has not been
*22:21.700- 22:28.180* :  a good president. He's a global leader and that he is not up for the job. He is. He's campaigning
*22:28.180- 22:35.040* :  all across the country. He knows the world in which we live. He has integrity. He's fighting. He's
*22:35.040- 22:42.120* :  honest. And I think that people will look at the differences between a Joe Biden because Joe Biden
*22:42.120- 22:48.180* :  has indicated he is going to run and I'm glad he is. He's going to continue to run and see the
*22:48.180- 22:53.500* :  contrast between him and Donald Trump. Do they want four years of a convicted felon or not?
*22:53.500- 22:58.460* :  And Joe Biden has proven that he and Vice President Harris can beat Donald Trump and they'll do it
*22:58.460- 23:04.240* :  again. P.J. Crowley is the former deputy press secretary under President Clinton and he says the
*23:04.240- 23:09.900* :  president's future is far from certain. Every president has a crisis. And obviously in
*23:09.900- 23:15.800* :  President Clinton's case, it was Monica Lewinsky. And they are the press overplayed its hand,
*23:15.800- 23:22.040* :  the Republicans on the hill, through impeachment overplayed their hand. President Clinton's not only
*23:22.040- 23:29.020* :  recovered his approval rating. At the end of 2000, he was more popper than he was when he won his
*23:29.020- 23:35.240* :  second term. But President Clinton had, you know, he had a way with words, right? And I mean,
*23:35.240- 23:40.560* :  that is a challenge for Joe Biden. He's older, less articulate. And that's going to be his
*23:40.560- 23:45.540* :  challenge between now and November. But who could replace Mr. Biden if he were to step aside?
*23:45.540- 23:51.620* :  Katrina Perry of the Global Story podcast has been speaking to the BBC US special correspondent
*23:51.620- 23:57.420* :  Katty Kaye. It's also been something of a mystery to me, the degree to which Kamala Harris is
*23:58.180- 24:04.180* :  really sort of hated by some on the right of American politics. I wonder why? Because really,
*24:04.180- 24:09.380* :  she hasn't done very much. I mean, Vice President is a sort of fairly powerless, innocuous
*24:09.380- 24:14.200* :  figures. And I would say that has been pretty much true of Kamala Harris. So it's sort of hard to
*24:14.360- 24:18.660* :  totally understand unless there's an element of her being a woman, a non-white candidate,
*24:19.240- 24:23.260* :  all of those things are raised by supporters of Kamala Harris to explain why she hasn't been
*24:23.260- 24:28.940* :  popular. Since the debate, there's been one or two polls suggesting that actually she would
*24:28.940- 24:33.760* :  outperform Joe Biden up against Donald Trump. Who knows whether that's true or not.
*24:33.900- 24:38.720* :  Katty, if it's not Kamala Harris, then a few other names have been knocking around in recent days.
*24:38.720- 24:43.660* :  Obviously, California Governor Gavin Newsom, I think the self-declared available candidate there.
*24:44.120- 24:48.200* :  And also the Michigan Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, can you tell us a little bit about those two?
*24:48.200- 24:53.320* :  She is routinely named in the last few days as the person that Democrats feel would have the
*24:53.320- 24:58.920* :  best chance of beating Donald Trump. She's a fairly centrist, articulate on television. She
*24:58.920- 25:05.480* :  prosecutes the case against Donald Trump forcefully. Gavin Newsom, although he has been out around
*25:05.480- 25:11.120* :  the country for a while, raising his own profile in big television interviews and big events,
*25:11.120- 25:16.380* :  and clearly would like to be president of the United States one day and makes no bones about that,
*25:16.420- 25:22.720* :  he is not somebody that is named for 2024 in this cycle. I think that's because the sort of whole
*25:22.720- 25:28.320* :  California Democrat thing is seen as too unappealing to centrist voters in
*25:28.660- 25:32.580* :  Roswell states. And they don't think that a California Democrat is what they need. They feel
*25:32.580- 25:38.000* :  they need a Midwesterner, which Gretchen Whitmer is. Katty, a quick rid on Michelle Obama. His name is
*25:38.000- 25:45.720* :  also being rolled around. The kind of myth that won't go. No, it's not happening. Michelle Obama
*25:45.720- 25:50.140* :  has made it very clear that she has absolutely zero interest in returning to the White House in
*25:50.140- 25:55.500* :  any capacity. Eight years there as first lady was quite enough for her. I think Democrats have
*25:55.500- 26:00.760* :  to give up on that fantasy fast. Katty Kay is speaking to Katrina Perry there. And if you want to hear
*26:00.760- 26:05.420* :  more of that discussion, you can listen to the global story wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*26:06.620- 26:11.520* :  Now, you know those big royal events in the UK when the royal family wave from the balcony at
*26:11.520- 26:16.880* :  Buckingham Palace to the crowds below. Well, now the public can visit the room they emerge from
*26:16.880- 26:22.520* :  and other areas of the palace's East Wing. Our culture correspondent Charlotte Gallagher has been
*26:22.520- 26:29.300* :  for a preview from Jubilee's coronations and marriages. The Buckingham Palace balcony has seen
*26:29.300- 26:35.600* :  generations of the royal family step out and wave to the crowds. Now visitors will be able to
*26:35.600- 26:41.080* :  look through the balcony doors and down the mall, though they won't actually be allowed out onto
*26:41.080- 26:46.380* :  it. Other parts of the East Wing people will be able to visit include the yellow drawing room with
*26:46.380- 26:53.800* :  towering porcelain pagodas and detailed wallpaper, which was recently taken down and painstakingly
*26:53.800- 26:59.480* :  restored before being placed back. The public will also be able to walk down the principal corridor
*26:59.480- 27:04.520* :  which is filled with priceless art and see Jonathan Yo's new painting of the king.
*27:05.220- 27:11.000* :  Charlotte Gallagher always oddly comfortable in a palace. The Simpsons has a remarkable record
*27:11.000- 27:16.160* :  of predicting the future. There was a mention of President Trump 16 years before it happened,
*27:16.160- 27:23.040* :  then Homer Simpson won a Winter Olympics curling gold medal beating Sweden in the final eight years
*27:23.040- 27:27.160* :  before the U.S. his first ever curling gold medal where they beat Sweden in the final.
*27:27.820- 27:33.980* :  On Wednesday and other Simpson's joke, this one made 28 years ago will become a reality. American
*27:33.980- 27:40.560* :  hip-hop trio Cypress Hill will perform a concert at the Royal Albert Hall accompanied by the London
*27:40.560- 27:44.640* :  Symphony Orchestra. Here's our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson.
*27:52.860- 27:58.640* :  This is the sound of the 90s hip-hop act Cypress Hill rehashing with the London Symphony Orchestra,
*27:58.640- 28:05.340* :  a collaboration almost 30 years in the making. Come on people, somebody order the London Symphony Orchestra,
*28:06.140- 28:10.600* :  possibly while high. Cypress Hill, I'm looking in your direction.
*28:10.700- 28:17.340* :  It was back in 1996 when an episode of The Simpsons called Homer Pollusa featured a joke
*28:17.340- 28:22.980* :  where Cypress Hill believed they had mistakenly booked the LSO while under the influence.
*28:23.420- 28:24.760* :  Oh yeah, we think we did.
*28:26.240- 28:32.340* :  Tonight that joke becomes a reality at the Royal Albert Hall.
*28:32.980- 28:35.560* :  Beereal is one of Cypress Hill's founding members.
*28:36.360- 28:41.260* :  It's been something that we've talked about for many years since The Simpsons episode first aired
*28:41.260- 28:45.820* :  the what if like what if we actually did that? How did it come about?
*28:46.020- 28:49.980* :  It didn't actually start to come to life till a tweet happened.
*28:50.360- 28:57.420* :  In 2017 the band reminded people about the episode on their social media and the London Symphony Orchestra
*28:58.040- 28:59.680* :  replied quoting some of the dialogue.
*29:07.280- 29:11.820* :  Cypress Hill were the first rap group to be given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
*29:12.180- 29:16.940* :  and tonight's show will feature their Black Sunday album being played in its entirety.
*29:21.640- 29:27.420* :  It's sold more than 3 million copies in the US and spent a whole year on the UK charts.
*29:33.280- 29:36.860* :  Maxine Kwok is the London Symphony Orchestra's first violin.
*29:37.200- 29:41.040* :  It's just going to be so epic when you think that this was sort of predicted.
*29:41.560- 29:45.700* :  In the 90s it's really incredible to think it's actually happening.
*29:46.060- 29:49.580* :  It's such an unlikely story this. It really is.
*29:49.760- 29:54.400* :  But it actually fits together incredibly well and it's so exciting for us.
*29:54.760- 29:57.720* :  Is this the swearingest gig in the LSO history?
*29:59.480- 30:01.740* :  Yes I think potentially it is.
*30:04.140- 30:07.360* :  There have however been some moments of cultural confusion.
*30:07.360- 30:12.840* :  I was told that when the words Glock had been used during rehearsals as an abbreviation for
*30:12.840- 30:17.160* :  the Procuse of Instruments Glockenspiel, Cypress Hill were taken aback.
*30:17.740- 30:20.240* :  To them a Glock will always be a gun.
*30:30.380- 30:34.980* :  The punchline of the Homer Pollusa episode was that the London Symphony Orchestra
*30:34.980- 30:39.080* :  had actually been booked by the English soft rocker Peter Frampton,
*30:39.520- 30:42.640* :  best known for his album, Frampton Comes Alive.
*30:44.260- 30:45.200* :  See you on the guest list?
*30:45.420- 30:46.320* :  Yeah he is.
*30:46.320- 30:49.320* :  Actually we've been trying to invite him.
*30:49.760- 30:49.980* :  No.
*30:50.260- 30:52.640* :  Yeah yeah we've never met him before,
*30:52.640- 30:56.960* :  but we thought it would be a kick to invite the legendary Peter Frampton you know.
*30:57.380- 30:57.960* :  Is he going to come?
*30:58.080- 30:59.360* :  We don't know. We're still waiting.
*31:02.040- 31:06.520* :  And as for Cypress Hill, they really feel tonight's show has been their destiny.
*31:07.220- 31:11.640* :  We salute the Simpsons man because if they had not written that episode,
*31:12.580- 31:13.980* :  we probably wouldn't be doing this.
*31:17.240- 31:19.980* :  That report from Colin Patterson with Cypress Hill.
*31:22.800- 31:26.100* :  And that's it from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*31:26.100- 31:30.080* :  later. If you would like to comment on this edition or the topics covered in it,

*32:34.940- 32:39.460* :  by creating their own version of American Idol.
