*01:31.600- 01:34.760* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:37.920- 01:42.620* :  I'm Paul Moss and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 31st of July, these are our main stories.
*01:42.620- 01:47.820* :  Israel says it carried out an airstrike in Beirut targeting a Hisbola commander
*01:48.280- 01:51.900* :  when the held responsible for last Saturday's attack on the Golan Heights.
*01:52.700- 01:57.160* :  There's been violence on the streets of Venezuela following the results of Sunday's presidential
*01:57.160- 02:03.260* :  election, which gave Nicholas Maduro a third term, and rescue teams in southern India have been
*02:03.260- 02:10.180* :  struggling in heavy rain to find survivors of massive landslides, which have killed more than 120 people.
*02:13.320- 02:14.340* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:14.340- 02:19.600* :  As a career law enforcement officer, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.
*02:20.140- 02:26.120* :  The new head of the U.S. Secret Service offers an abject apology for its failure to stop Donald
*02:26.120- 02:35.340* :  Trump's would-be assassin. There wasn't any waiting around for a claim of responsibility,
*02:35.340- 02:38.600* :  just minutes after an explosion was heard in Beirut.
*02:38.980- 02:43.280* :  Israel issued a statement saying it had launched an airstrike on the Lebanese capital.
*02:43.740- 02:48.560* :  It later said it had eliminated the Hezbollah military commander for Adshukla,
*02:49.100- 02:53.700* :  who had held responsible for a rocket attack on the Golan Heights area last Saturday,
*02:53.700- 02:58.660* :  which killed 12 young people. Our correspondent in Lebanon is Hugo Bachega.
*02:58.920- 03:05.440* :  We haven't had any reaction from Hezbollah yet. Obviously we're waiting to hear what they have to say,
*03:05.440- 03:11.860* :  what they're going to do. I think it's almost inevitable that there will be some kind of retaliation,
*03:11.860- 03:18.420* :  but we had a statement from the Israeli military saying that Fawad Shukert was killed.
*03:18.420- 03:25.740* :  They called it a precise operation. They described him as the right-hand man to Hassan Nasrallah,
*03:25.740- 03:31.800* :  who is the leader of Hezbollah. He was also described as being someone involved in planning
*03:32.540- 03:37.320* :  and coordinating attacks and operations that have been carried out by the group. And again,
*03:37.780- 03:44.180* :  if confirmed, he is the most high-profile Hezbollah figure to have been killed by Israel
*03:44.180- 03:51.260* :  in this current violence with Hezbollah. So a very significant figure here and a very significant
*03:51.760- 03:56.420* :  operation by the Israelis and perhaps victory for the Israelis if this killing is confirmed.
*03:56.860- 04:01.840* :  I looked at some of that footage and although they are describing it as a targeted attack,
*04:01.840- 04:08.760* :  it looks like the damage was quite widespread. Do we know if it is Mr Shukert who was killed
*04:08.760- 04:12.820* :  with other injuries, other people caught up in the attack?
*04:13.300- 04:19.060* :  Yes, so this is a densely populated area in the southern suburbs of Beirut,
*04:19.060- 04:25.000* :  an area known as Tahir. And I was there for the last time, just two weeks ago, for the Ashura
*04:25.000- 04:31.260* :  celebrations for Shia Muslims. So this is a very busy area and we've seen pictures of the
*04:31.260- 04:37.520* :  destruction there, the damage that has been caused by this attack at least one building partially
*04:37.520- 04:43.760* :  collapsed as a result of this attack. And the Lebanese authorities are saying that at least three
*04:44.720- 04:51.900* :  people were killed, more than 70 were injured as a result of this attack. But again, as you say,
*04:52.180- 04:58.380* :  there was significant destruction there after this attack that happened just before sunset in Beirut.
*04:58.940- 05:03.860* :  There have been these calls over the past few months and again in the last few days for Israel
*05:04.320- 05:09.760* :  to show some kind of restraint when it came to Lebanon to avoid a full-scale regional war.
*05:10.320- 05:16.700* :  I know it's guess what, but does this counter as restrained in the Israeli playbook to have a
*05:16.700- 05:23.720* :  targeted attack perhaps just one explosion resulting? Well, we don't know whether the reaction
*05:24.540- 05:30.760* :  and I think for Hezbollah perhaps this could be seen as a major provocation by Israel because
*05:30.760- 05:37.560* :  this is an attack that targeted a senior commander, a high profile commander inside the group.
*05:38.100- 05:43.260* :  It targeted the group's stronghold in Beirut. So it is very significant. And again,
*05:43.260- 05:50.120* :  I think it's almost inevitable that we're going to see a significant reaction from Hezbollah.
*05:50.120- 05:55.960* :  But again, there have been these concerns since the beginning of these attacks by Hezbollah
*05:56.140- 06:02.260* :  and the counter attacks by Israel that we could see an escalation of violence that could end up
*06:02.260- 06:07.040* :  in a major confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah. And we know that Hezbollah is supported
*06:07.040- 06:12.860* :  by Iran. Some other groups backed by Iran in the Middle East have been saying that if there is
*06:12.860- 06:18.220* :  a major war between Hezbollah and Israel, they're going to join Hezbollah in the fight against Israel.
*06:18.220- 06:25.540* :  So this is a very dangerous moment here. Hugo Bachega. While tensions rise between Israel and Lebanon,
*06:26.040- 06:30.680* :  strains within Israel have reached a new level. It began when Israel's military police
*06:30.680- 06:36.200* :  went to a detention camp to investigate reports that 10 reservists in the armed forces
*06:36.200- 06:42.160* :  physically and sexually abused a Palestinian prisoner. He was taken to hospital needing surgery.
*06:42.940- 06:47.620* :  But when the police tried to enter the camp, they were challenged by soldiers. Then far-right
*06:47.620- 06:52.240* :  members of the Israeli Parliament tried to storm the base to show the soldiers their support.
*06:52.240- 06:58.040* :  Since then, another Israeli soldier has been indicted. He's accused of attacking handcuffed
*06:58.040- 07:04.020* :  detainees with a club documenting this on video. As for the original Palestinian detainee,
*07:04.460- 07:10.160* :  his situation is still critical, according to Unegben Drawer from the campaign group Physicians
*07:10.160- 07:13.740* :  for Human Rights. She spoke about the case to Julian Marshall.
*07:14.280- 07:20.640* :  What we know that he has been hospitalized in a life-straightening condition with severe injuries
*07:20.640- 07:29.660* :  in his upper body and in his rectum. And this is the only reason why this case has been revealed.
*07:30.260- 07:38.480* :  And in your experience from what you know, what has happened to this detainee at this military
*07:38.480- 07:47.500* :  camp or base is not unusual? Since they were started, unfortunately, it is usual Palestinians
*07:47.500- 07:55.160* :  in Israeli custody, including dozen detainees, are going through torture, sexual violence and
*07:55.160- 08:01.780* :  physical violence, some resulted with broken bones and some also died because of that.
*08:02.300- 08:09.140* :  How do you know this? Because you've said to me that the case of the Palestinian detainee
*08:09.140- 08:15.900* :  who was hospitalized meant that it had become public knowledge. But these are the cases that you're
*08:15.900- 08:23.080* :  talking about. I mean, how do you get information about them? So we get from people who got released,
*08:24.000- 08:29.520* :  from lawyer visits, because that's the only way now to communicate with Palestinians in prison
*08:29.520- 08:37.320* :  and in detention, whether it's under the Israeli Army custody or the prison service custody.
*08:38.020- 08:44.040* :  And we know also, for instance, in this specific detention facility, which is inside the military
*08:44.040- 08:49.800* :  base, which is called Sattaman. We also know some of the information from whistleblowers,
*08:49.880- 08:54.980* :  people who are physicians who are working in a field hospital that was established there.
*08:55.440- 09:01.700* :  I mean, in this particular case, IDF reservists are being questioned by the military police.
*09:01.700- 09:09.960* :  Is that unusual? We started to see and there was a public announcement that the military
*09:09.960- 09:16.820* :  police started to investigate some cases after the ICC. And yeah, we haven't seen that before
*09:16.820- 09:23.220* :  that. And I would say that also in this case, we called for an investigation, an international one,
*09:23.760- 09:30.420* :  but again, we know of many other cases of abuse and torture and maltreatment that haven't been
*09:30.420- 09:37.600* :  investigated. What was that ICC announcement that has prompted this apparent change of policy?
*09:38.200- 09:43.960* :  Basically, about the detention order regarding Netanyahu and Galaam, I think the possibility
*09:44.460- 09:50.540* :  of issuing this order made some of the parties involved pushed them to do some steps.
*09:51.280- 09:55.700* :  On Egg Bendraw, we asked the Israeli military for comment. They said they would check to see if
*09:55.700- 10:01.140* :  someone was available to talk to the BBC. We now know that the three children killed in a knife
*10:01.140- 10:07.420* :  attack in the English town of Southport on Monday, were aged 9, 7, and 6. Eight other children
*10:07.420- 10:12.380* :  and two adults were wounded, with some of them still in a critical condition. All had gone to a
*10:12.380- 10:17.900* :  Taylor Swift themed yoga and dance class. Britain's Prime Minister visited the scene on Tuesday
*10:18.560- 10:23.860* :  and police there later came under attack from rioters who threw missiles at a one point appeared
*10:23.860- 10:30.080* :  to set a police car on fire. A 17-year-old boy remains in custody accused of murder and attempted
*10:30.080- 10:36.440* :  murder. From Southport, Judith Moritz sent this report. Photographs showing the three young victims
*10:36.440- 10:42.440* :  were released today. They were Alisa GR, just nine years old, beaming in a beautiful party dress.
*10:42.840- 10:45.340* :  Her parents say she'll always be their princess.
*10:45.340- 10:52.200* :  Elsie.Stankham aged seven, smiling proudly for her school photograph, and BB King just six
*10:52.200- 10:57.940* :  years old, smiling with her milk-teeth missing. Her families say they have no words to describe
*10:57.940- 11:03.620* :  the devastation that's hit them. How can you find the words? Three children who were just dancing,
*11:04.240- 11:09.280* :  and now they're gone. It's impossible to make sense of this. Southport is reeling.
*11:09.880- 11:15.420* :  At the cordon today, many came to lay flowers. Most were simply too upset to talk.
*11:15.960- 11:19.120* :  Leanne Hassan's daughter goes to a nursery just down the road.
*11:19.360- 11:21.400* :  I just can't believe something like this could happen.
*11:23.440- 11:27.520* :  Right where we live, you know, the children are just asking to join in the Somahazis and
*11:28.780- 11:34.380* :  they never got to go that night. I'm just heartbroken for the parents to go and even begin to
*11:34.380- 11:39.980* :  imagine what he must be going through. As well as members of the public, the firefighters of
*11:39.980- 11:45.460* :  Greenwatch who went to help the children yesterday laid flowers speechless and numb. Later,
*11:45.680- 11:49.320* :  ambulance crews who raced to save them and treat their wounds brought reads.
*11:50.220- 11:54.680* :  But there was anger here too, as the Prime Minister came to pay his respect he was heckled
*11:54.680- 11:59.680* :  by a local woman. I've just found out my friend's nine-year-old daughter was killed.
*12:01.920- 12:07.220* :  The person I held, the child, he's ready to become Prime Minister.
*12:10.380- 12:13.920* :  Sir Kierstama said the attack has touched a nerve with the whole country.
*12:14.440- 12:21.980* :  It's awful to contemplate what happened. I think about the families, the friends, the loved ones,
*12:21.980- 12:28.740* :  those directly impacted and of course the wider community here. There's no pretending, I think,
*12:29.560- 12:35.840* :  anybody in the country is not untouched by what happened yesterday. Taylor Swift herself
*12:35.840- 12:41.760* :  has posted on Instagram to say the horror is washing over her continuously. A fundraiser by her
*12:41.760- 12:47.820* :  fans, Swifties for Southport, is approaching nearly 200,000 pounds. Judith Moritz.
*12:48.920- 12:53.580* :  The protesters on the streets of Venezuela were at least warned the country's president,
*12:53.580- 12:59.260* :  Nicholas Maduro, had suggested that if he lost Sunday's election, there would be bloodshed.
*12:59.600- 13:04.700* :  Well, a lot of people insist that Mr. Maduro did lose that exit polls showed an overwhelming
*13:04.700- 13:09.960* :  victory for the opposition candidate, Edmundton Gonzalez. That's why they've taken to the streets
*13:09.960- 13:15.940* :  and bloodshed there has been. Several protesters at least were reportedly killed by the security forces,
*13:16.480- 13:19.680* :  tear gas and bullets the response to opposition grievances.
*13:23.100- 13:30.080* :  We have problems with electoral fraud in Venezuela. We have no democracy. The votes were stolen
*13:30.660- 13:35.840* :  and the opposition leader has proved that the opposition won the election this year.
*13:39.580- 13:43.180* :  Recalling on the international community, on countries like Colombia and Brazil,
*13:43.180- 13:48.860* :  to make a statement and we're waiting for good decisions, the people are in the streets doing
*13:48.860- 13:54.340* :  what they should be doing, fighting for their vote, protesting. We're tired of this crisis,
*13:54.760- 14:00.720* :  tired of this misery. Venezuela's president is conceding no ground when it comes to those taking
*14:00.720- 14:06.780* :  part in the demonstrations. His attorney general said 749 protesters have been arrested.
*14:06.780- 14:12.660* :  Nicholas Maduro described them as criminals and terrorists. And the country's defence minister,
*14:12.660- 14:18.100* :  Vladimir Padrino, had equally harsh words for those who refused to accept the results of the vote.
*14:22.380- 14:27.620* :  We are in the present, quite simply, of a coup d'état and a coup d'état engineered again
*14:27.620- 14:33.960* :  by these fascist factors of the extreme right, supported, of course, by US imperialism and its allies.
*14:34.880- 14:39.020* :  The president and commander-in-chief of the National Armed Forces, Nicholas Maduro,
*14:39.020- 14:44.000* :  has taken the lead to stop it. And yet, those protests didn't stop. Indeed, more
*14:44.000- 14:48.080* :  took place throughout Tuesday, as I heard from our correspondent in Caracas,
*14:48.080- 14:54.040* :  Roberto Paredes. There were a lot of people today attending to the call from Maria
*14:54.040- 15:01.960* :  Corina to go to streets peacefully. Yesterday we saw the largest protest in Venezuela in many years.
*15:02.920- 15:10.500* :  It was supported at one person died. Today we see Caracas completely blocked. Many shops are closed.
*15:11.100- 15:17.700* :  People are in streets again and not only in Caracas, but across Venezuela. People say that they
*15:17.700- 15:25.120* :  don't leave the results, the official results, even by the electoral authority. And they say they're
*15:25.120- 15:30.060* :  tired of the government. They say they want to change. And they're back in Maria Corina
*15:30.060- 15:34.880* :  Machado's results, that she says that even in the Gonzalez won the election.
*15:35.840- 15:41.080* :  You're in a part of Caracas where I think people are normally considered to be big fans of
*15:41.080- 15:45.220* :  Nicolas Maduro. A Maduro stronghold, if you like. What are you hearing there?
*15:46.320- 15:52.660* :  Yes, so what's interesting about the protests this day is that people protesting are people from
*15:52.660- 15:59.300* :  the slums, people who are loyal to Nicolas Maduro and the Chavismo movement. These people always
*15:59.300- 16:06.080* :  voted for Chavez and for Maduro. And now they are voting for the position for the first time.
*16:06.660- 16:12.740* :  And they say that the economic crisis have hit them really hard. They were just saying a few
*16:12.740- 16:17.820* :  moments ago that they want liberty because they feel that they don't live in a democratic country anymore.
*16:22.720- 16:27.880* :  Still to come. The fact that these animals who look into our eyes and ask for help will be wiped out.
*16:27.880- 16:32.080* :  As far as I'm concerned, no one can take a life that was created by God.
*16:33.880- 16:39.920* :  Protests across Turkey as its parliament legislates to round up the country's four million stray dogs.
*16:49.500- 16:55.980* :  It's that time of the year. You're a vacation is coming up. You can already hear the beach waves,
*16:56.060- 17:05.080* :  feel the warm breeze, relax and think about work. You really, really want it all to work out while

*17:54.760- 17:59.600* :  The tea plantations of Kerala are considered to be one of India's more elegant spectacles,
*18:00.060- 18:04.100* :  terrorist layers of tea plants rising majestically over the surrounding terrain.
*18:05.000- 18:09.080* :  But these towering edifices proved fatal when torrential rains hit
*18:09.080- 18:15.100* :  why on our district causing landslides. The latest figures suggest more than 120 people have
*18:15.100- 18:19.440* :  been killed and about a hundred are still missing. Our South Asia regional editor,
*18:19.440- 18:25.140* :  Ambarassan Ethirajan, explained why the death toll was so high. According to officials,
*18:25.140- 18:30.060* :  many of those killed were among the lowly paid workers in the state. They usually live in
*18:30.500- 18:38.100* :  small tin roof houses or thatched roof houses along the tier states. And because these houses were not
*18:38.100- 18:43.800* :  made of concrete or anything strong, it was also easily affected by these huge landslides.
*18:44.060- 18:49.780* :  We have seen that big houses built in those areas. They can be just washed away when the
*18:49.780- 18:56.880* :  whole mountainside caves in. So, dozens of people have been buried alive. A torrent of muddy water
*18:56.880- 19:03.240* :  washed through that area. Rescue forces have now moved into some of these localities trying to
*19:03.760- 19:08.260* :  retrieve people from under the mud. But they are struggling because it is difficult to get the
*19:08.260- 19:13.580* :  vehicles like the JCB and the Big Bulldozers to those areas. And they expect the number of
*19:13.580- 19:19.500* :  people who died in this unfortunate incidents to go up. This is not the first time this kind of
*19:19.500- 19:26.200* :  disaster has hit Kerala. I saw that 500 people died in monsoon-related flooding six years ago there.
*19:26.860- 19:31.580* :  And yet it seems that monsoon rains in India have been getting worse and more severe.
*19:32.660- 19:37.800* :  Two reasons. One experts are now blaming the climate change, man-induced, human being
*19:37.800- 19:44.500* :  induced climate change. That is triggering very intense rain falling at a very short time,
*19:44.500- 19:49.260* :  like within 48 hours or within three days they're getting a week's worth of rain.
*19:49.260- 19:54.660* :  On the other hand, environmentalists also blame the setting up of our resorts,
*19:54.660- 20:00.840* :  clearing so many trees from the hill sites, huge dam projects, and also settlements.
*20:01.740- 20:06.740* :  The cities are expanding further into the forest areas, more trees are being cut. So,
*20:06.740- 20:13.160* :  they are also blaming the development activities for this phenomenon. And Kerala is particularly
*20:13.160- 20:19.380* :  vulnerable because it faces very heavy monsoon sometimes. Even though monsoon rains are vital
*20:19.380- 20:25.700* :  lifeline for the farming community, especially Kerala gets very intense monsoon in 2018 more than
*20:25.700- 20:31.800* :  400 people died because of these heavy rains. But now the opposition politicians and experts are
*20:32.220- 20:37.260* :  urging the government to come out with a bigger plan how to manage landslides,
*20:37.720- 20:41.760* :  what kind of precautionary measures they have to take. Because a few weeks ago we saw
*20:41.760- 20:47.460* :  similar situation in the northeast of India in the states of Assam and Meghalaya where the landslides
*20:47.460- 20:51.120* :  were happening and killing many people. Ambarasanthirajan
*20:51.660- 20:56.680* :  Bit by bit, detailed by detail, we're learning a little more about the man who apparently tried to
*20:56.680- 21:01.980* :  kill Donald Trump. A US Senate hearing has been told that Thomas Crookes posted violent,
*21:01.980- 21:08.480* :  anti-Semitic, and anti-immigrant content online when he was a teenager. He also flew a drone near
*21:08.480- 21:14.060* :  the spot he fired from, part of what looks like an advanced reconnaissance mission. The fact that
*21:14.060- 21:19.340* :  this wasn't spotted and that Crookes himself wasn't spotted when he climbed on that nearby roof.
*21:19.340- 21:24.840* :  These were failures for which the acting head of the US Secret Service has now apologised.
*21:25.220- 21:29.940* :  The former head, Kimberly Cheetle, was forced to resign last week. Her successor, Ronald Rowe,
*21:30.340- 21:33.960* :  had a tone of unqualified contrition when he addressed the hearing.
*21:34.620- 21:39.620* :  I identified gaps in our security on July 13th and have implemented corrective actions.
*21:41.100- 21:45.220* :  One of my first actions as acting director was traveling to the Butler Farm show site
*21:45.800- 21:50.840* :  to better understand how our protection failed. I went to the roof of the AGR building
*21:51.900- 21:57.360* :  where the assailant fired shots and I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight.
*21:58.340- 22:05.680* :  What I saw made me ashamed. As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran
*22:05.680- 22:10.820* :  with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.
*22:11.460- 22:15.540* :  Ronald Rowe, were watching that testimony and the hearing itself, was our correspondent,
*22:15.540- 22:22.880* :  Nomiya Igbal. It was interesting because Ronald Rowe appeared at the hearing with clearly in mind
*22:22.880- 22:27.960* :  that it didn't go so well last week for his predecessor, Kimberly Cheetle, who faced
*22:27.960- 22:33.940* :  unanimous calls to stand down. Her testimony had been pretty vague. She hadn't given clear answers
*22:33.940- 22:39.400* :  and she'd been on the defensive, whereas Mr Rowe came here with a lot more strength, I would say,
*22:39.640- 22:44.600* :  and he made sure that he was contrite about what had happened. As we heard there in that clip,
*22:44.600- 22:49.060* :  he said that it made him ashamed. He did not shy away from the catastrophic failures,
*22:49.060- 22:54.540* :  but he was also pretty tough as well in his positions. He said that there were investigations
*22:54.700- 23:00.760* :  underway, that he had lost sleepless nights. There were moments when there was a shouting match
*23:00.760- 23:06.700* :  between him and some of the Republican senators who were usually, they're very loyal to Donald Trump,
*23:06.700- 23:12.440* :  and they do tend to put on these kind of performances in the hearing. But Mr Rowe,
*23:13.140- 23:19.240* :  he was very clear in that, the secret service had to take accountability, and that he was the
*23:19.240- 23:24.000* :  man to make sure that that would happen. Now, what about Thomas Crookes, as I said, there was more
*23:24.000- 23:30.940* :  about him in the hearing. What else did we learn? We did. We heard more from the FBI's deputy director,
*23:30.980- 23:41.120* :  who was also in the hearing alongside Mr Rowe, and we heard that between 2019 and 2020, I think it
*23:41.120- 23:48.280* :  was about 700 comments found on a social media account, which they believe Mr Crookes was
*23:48.780- 23:56.160* :  linked to, and this showed post that they said were anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, and generally
*23:56.160- 24:01.700* :  just very extreme in nature. The crucial thing, however, is we still don't know the motivation.
*24:02.540- 24:09.080* :  We still don't know what motivated him at all. The secret service said that within firing the shot,
*24:09.080- 24:16.140* :  he was neutralised by the secret service within 15 seconds. We learnt that. But as of yet, we don't
*24:16.140- 24:23.340* :  know exactly what led him to carry out this attempt to disassass nation on Donald Trump, and that's
*24:23.400- 24:27.520* :  just going to be one of the enduring questions I imagine of this investigation.
*24:28.060- 24:33.060* :  I see that the secret service is now expanding its protection to people like JD Vance and the
*24:33.060- 24:38.920* :  independent candidate, Robert Kennedy. Robert Rowe, in his testimony, said that the threat of
*24:38.920- 24:44.900* :  political violence is, quote, alive and well. In Washington, does it feel like there's a permanently
*24:44.900- 24:50.940* :  changed mood in the wake of the July 13th shooting? I think the secret service is definitely
*24:50.940- 24:54.220* :  under huge pressure at the moment. Whether or not they've changed any of their internal
*24:54.220- 25:00.960* :  procedures, we don't know because they wouldn't say that out loud necessarily. They have gone on to
*25:00.960- 25:05.260* :  say that the Democratic National Convention, which is due to happen next month in Chicago,
*25:06.060- 25:10.140* :  the security is tight, but you imagine security was always going to be tight, the same with the
*25:10.140- 25:16.020* :  Republican National Convention that just happened. But the secret service remember they're there to
*25:16.480- 25:21.360* :  prevent an assassination. They're not there to investigate attempted assassinations. It's a
*25:21.360- 25:25.520* :  huge failure by them, and they are more conscious now about the way they're operating.
*25:30.380- 25:36.560* :  Australia is in the grip of a housing crisis. It's thought about 120,000 people now have nowhere
*25:36.560- 25:42.900* :  to live. Rents have been rising the fastest in Western Australia, 20% in the past year alone.
*25:43.640- 25:48.160* :  But that also happens to be the wealthiest part of the country, so where's it all gone wrong?
*25:48.580- 25:51.980* :  Our Australia correspondent Katie Watson reports from Perth.
*25:53.560- 25:59.420* :  I've got my walker in the back and my pillows and rug. 71-year-old Mary is sat in the driver's
*25:59.420- 26:04.280* :  seat of her battered car, surrounded by her belongings. On the back seat is her Zimmer frame.
*26:04.820- 26:10.220* :  Next to her, there's a tin of rice pudding. And that's my evening meal. This tiny space is often
*26:10.220- 26:15.980* :  now Mary's home. Mary's not her real name. She doesn't want to be identified. She's ashamed.
*26:16.480- 26:23.220* :  It seems to be that the moment people know that you've become homeless, you've become what I call
*26:23.220- 26:30.120* :  a non-person. It's a life Mary never imagined she'd ever have. Pushed out of her flat last year
*26:30.120- 26:34.980* :  because her landlord wanted to render it out to short-term tenants, she couldn't find anywhere else.
*26:34.980- 26:39.900* :  She could afford on her pension. Mary's husband is in a care home with Alzheimer's. He doesn't know
*26:39.900- 26:47.960* :  she's living like this. He'd be horrified. Absolutely mortified. A 15-minute drive from the car park
*26:47.960- 26:53.560* :  that Mary's living in is Elizabeth Key in the centre of Perth. Swish new apartment blocks and
*26:53.560- 26:59.540* :  five-star hotels overlook glamorous white yachts bobbing in the marina. And then if you look up,
*26:59.900- 27:05.260* :  there are big neon signs on skyscrapers with the names of mining companies. It's hard to get
*27:05.260- 27:09.500* :  your head around, but in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, there are people like Mary
*27:09.500- 27:15.060* :  with nowhere to sleep through no fault of their own. And this isn't a problem that's particular
*27:15.060- 27:21.260* :  to Perth. In fact, it's happening across Australia. Older women are the fastest growing group of
*27:21.260- 27:26.460* :  homeless people in the country. Domestic violence also drives numbers up. But there's something else
*27:26.460- 27:31.600* :  happening. In recent years, record house prices have killed many people's dream of getting on the
*27:31.600- 27:36.920* :  property ladder, underinvestment in social housing and a growing population. Meant finding somewhere
*27:36.920- 27:44.700* :  affordable to rent can be a challenge. Haley and her daughter Taziccia have been couch surfing and
*27:44.700- 27:50.100* :  living in tents for nearly four years, most of Taziccia's life. They're on the list for social
*27:50.100- 27:56.440* :  housing, but nothing yet. Haley's tired and she's worried about her daughter too. She's constantly
*27:56.540- 28:02.620* :  getting sick, it doesn't matter. If I rug her up, it's the bacteria that are around. It's
*28:02.680- 28:07.040* :  moving around to getting used to different germs. She's going through a bit of separation
*28:07.160- 28:12.560* :  anxiety from her father at the moment because it's very hard to try and seek him all the time.
*28:14.640- 28:18.640* :  As evening falls and commuters exit their shiny office buildings and head home,
*28:19.200- 28:24.280* :  others start gathering in a square that backs on to the railway tracks. Every night, different
*28:24.280- 28:30.020* :  charities take turns to offer a little help. The Australian winters now kicked in and clothes are
*28:30.020- 28:37.360* :  in high demand. And the street chaplains are out tonight, before women giving out food to those
*28:37.360- 28:43.000* :  sleeping rough. Can I give you a meal? Just a few months ago, Michelle Rumbald was the one
*28:43.000- 28:47.900* :  receiving the handouts. A registered nurse left with nothing. After she got evicted,
*28:48.380- 28:51.440* :  crashed her car and her mother started struggling with her mental health.
*28:52.380- 28:57.380* :  I ended up losing my job purely because I didn't have accommodation and I didn't have a car.
*28:57.860- 29:02.260* :  I think it took a while for people to actually realise I was homeless because I didn't look homeless.
*29:02.320- 29:08.060* :  Gradually over time, you've become so used to the street that you lose yourself a bit.
*29:08.680- 29:12.900* :  Michelle managed to get transitional housing. She's now back on her feet with a job as a
*29:12.900- 29:18.800* :  nurse in a GP surgery. Michelle admits she got lucky, but with no quick solutions to Australia's
*29:18.800- 29:24.500* :  housing crisis, many more will be finding themselves in a desperate situation that they never expected.
*29:25.240- 29:31.820* :  Katie Watson. Politics in Turkey can be a pretty rough business, bitter, sometimes violent
*29:31.820- 29:37.000* :  disputes have previously split the country on issues like the role of Islam, the use of the
*29:37.000- 29:42.620* :  Kurdish language and what the truth is about the Armenian genocide. But currently it's another
*29:42.620- 29:48.260* :  subject that's got plenty of people there up in arms. Dogs. Turkey is estimated to have four
*29:48.260- 29:53.200* :  million stray dogs and the Turkish Parliament has approved a new law which would mean they're rounded
*29:53.200- 29:58.760* :  up and confined to shelters. Dog lovers fear this might be an excuse to have the animals killed
*29:58.780- 30:12.120* :  and they've been protests across the country. We will win by standing strong they
*30:12.120- 30:18.100* :  chanted and the massacre law should be withdrawn. One protestor simply carried a banner bearing
*30:18.100- 30:23.520* :  the biblical injunction you must not kill. Cheed M lives in Istanbul with her dog Max.
*30:24.180- 30:31.880* :  I'm very upset. I can't sleep at night and I'm very distressed. The fact that these animals
*30:31.880- 30:37.660* :  who look into our eyes and ask for help will be wiped out. As far as I'm concerned, no one can take
*30:37.660- 30:45.060* :  a life that was created by God. Even people who've had bad canine experiences had some sympathy with
*30:45.060- 30:53.300* :  the protest. A dem is the grandfather of a boy who was bitten by a stray. They should take the
*30:53.300- 30:58.680* :  dogs off the street and find them homes or put them under protection. It's a shame. The dogs
*30:58.680- 31:04.380* :  attack people who are passing by. They're actually docile, you know, but children roll them up.
*31:04.840- 31:09.320* :  Does that too? Children were at the centre of the arguments which led to the new law reaching
*31:09.320- 31:15.400* :  Turkey's Parliament and being passed as the BBC's Eileen Yazan explained to my colleague James Reynolds.
*31:15.880- 31:21.580* :  There's this association which was founded in 2022 called Safe Street Association and they
*31:21.580- 31:28.260* :  argued that around 100 people, almost half of the markets died because of stray dog-related
*31:28.780- 31:33.640* :  reasons. Most of them are kids who were running away from dogs and they got hit by cars.
*31:33.640- 31:40.040* :  So we can say that 4 million dogs and like 100 people died in last three years.
*31:40.520- 31:46.240* :  The law proposing getting rid of all the dogs from the streets. Those dogs would go to shelters.
*31:46.240- 31:50.920* :  I mean that's a lot of dogs to put into shelters. Apparently Turkey doesn't have that capacity yet.
*31:50.920- 31:57.280* :  The law says that the dogs will be put down. If they present a danger to life or health of people
*31:57.280- 32:03.460* :  and animals, display uncontrollable negative behaviour, have a contagious or incurable disease
*32:03.940- 32:09.480* :  or whose adoption is forbidden. So these dogs will be put down and it's very ambiguous.
*32:09.940- 32:14.860* :  And the critics say that it will pave the way to arbitrary practices.
*32:15.880- 32:23.560* :  And in terms of shelters, there are 322 municipal shelters in Turkey at the moment which has
*32:23.560- 32:30.660* :  a capacity of 105,000 and we are talking about 4 million dogs. And municipalities have four
*32:30.660- 32:37.240* :  years to build those shelters with no extra fund given to them. So we will see what's going to
*32:37.240- 32:39.880* :  happen but critics say that it's unmanageable.
*32:40.500- 32:44.600* :  Eileen Yesan. It can't be often that you get Iran's Ayatollah
*32:44.600- 32:51.140* :  Commanding lined up on the same side of an argument as all 120 of France's bishops and Cardinals
*32:51.140- 32:57.160* :  plus Donald Trump. But all of these have complained about the Paris Olympics opening ceremony.
*32:57.700- 33:02.760* :  Specifically it's the tableau which some claim was parodying Leonardo da Vinci's painting the
*33:02.760- 33:08.160* :  Last Supper. Now one of those who took part is fighting back with a complaint of her own.
*33:08.160- 33:13.840* :  Barbara Butch said her appearance in the scene had prompted a torrent of online abuse including
*33:13.840- 33:20.200* :  threats of violence as Isabella Joule reports. It's may have been just one element of the mammoth
*33:20.200- 33:26.540* :  opening ceremony but it's the most talked about. As dancers, models and drag queens
*33:26.540- 33:33.180* :  strutted their stuff over the scene in a sequence celebrating festivity, the French DJ Barbara Butch
*33:33.280- 33:37.080* :  performed a set wearing a silver headdress and a sparkling blue outfit.
*33:37.980- 33:43.420* :  All this before a semi-naked blue man was lowered onto the catwalk on a silver platter.
*33:44.480- 33:48.860* :  Now though the performer says she's been the target of cyber harassment of an increasingly
*33:48.860- 33:55.740* :  extreme nature and has filed several legal complaints. A lawyer from Isabella says she's been
*33:55.740- 34:01.260* :  threatened with death, torture and rape and has also been the target of numerous anti-Semitic,
*34:01.260- 34:08.400* :  homophobic, sexist and Greosophobic insults. Greosophobic is a French term which means discrimination
*34:08.400- 34:15.940* :  against people who are obese. Barbara Butch describes herself as a love activist. Last year she told
*34:15.940- 34:22.260* :  Attitude magazine quote, I'm a fat Jewish queer lesbian and I'm really proud of all my identities
*34:22.260- 34:29.260* :  because they make me what I am now as a human. In a defiant post on Instagram the French DJ at the
*34:29.260- 34:35.500* :  centre of this latest storm said she was extremely honoured to perform in the ceremony. She added whatever
*34:35.500- 34:41.520* :  some may say I exist, I've never been ashamed of who I am and I take responsibility for everything
*34:41.520- 34:48.240* :  including my artistic choices. All my life I've refused to be a victim. I won't shut up.

*36:03.340- 36:10.480* :  He killed at least 19 people during the 1980s in South Africa. Very dark times. People were desperate.
*36:11.020- 36:15.120* :  We were looking for him. We couldn't find him and nobody knew where he was.
*36:16.040- 36:22.100* :  Every single one of his victims was black. In each such a state where he was now hunting.
