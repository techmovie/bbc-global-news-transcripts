*01:33.000- 01:38.760* :  I'm Chris Barrow and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 6th of July listener Uter tells us how
*01:38.760- 01:45.340* :  the kindness of a man she just met changed her life. Everybody has something they can give
*01:45.340- 01:50.780* :  to others. Everybody can make somebody else's life a little bit better. You just have to have
*01:50.780- 01:56.180* :  the guts to go out and do it. Also the Kenyan woman using artificial intelligence to help farming
*01:56.180- 02:01.200* :  communities like the ones she grew up in. When we see reduced crop losses when we see improved
*02:01.200- 02:08.160* :  livelihoods life changed young girls like myself being able to access education. I don't think
*02:08.160- 02:13.440* :  this is something that can be more encouraging than that. And I'm pleased to take you through the
*02:13.440- 02:18.160* :  exhibition with this audio guide. We can explore the evolution of French fashion together.
*02:19.720- 02:24.040* :  Why Chinese stars and K-pop bands are guiding tourists around European museums.
*02:24.040- 02:28.960* :  Also in the podcast a study finds that chimps keep learning new skills throughout their lives
*02:28.960- 02:33.560* :  a habit previously thought to be unique to humans and the school exam with a difference.
*02:37.500- 02:41.640* :  You have to do a few tricks and then just knowledge about the sport as well.
*02:48.140- 02:53.260* :  Now you might have a big dream that seems almost impossible to achieve but you hope that one day
*02:53.740- 02:58.760* :  it might just come true. Well imagine bumping into a stranger who has the power and kindness
*02:58.760- 03:03.760* :  to make that happen. Well that's the story of one of our listeners Uter Berkmeier who's
*03:03.760- 03:07.960* :  originally from Germany. As a young woman she wanted nothing more than to attend the Cornell
*03:07.960- 03:13.280* :  Hotel School in New York and was working at a beach resort in Corsica trying to earn enough money
*03:13.280- 03:20.200* :  for her tuition. Then in 1987 she saw an American tourist Harry Pettsky and decided to wish him a happy
*03:20.200- 03:25.420* :  fourth of July. Well Harry revealed he'd attended the very university that Uter was working hard
*03:25.420- 03:30.860* :  to get into and he could help get her a scholarship from an anonymous donor. Well the pair became
*03:30.860- 03:35.720* :  lifelong friends and worked together to achieve Uter's goal. The happy pods Holly Gibbs
*03:35.720- 03:41.760* :  spoke to them on the anniversary of their chance meeting. Everybody said you will never get there.
*03:42.080- 03:48.060* :  There is no way I mean you won't you won't get accepted you don't have the money it's just so
*03:48.060- 03:53.340* :  hard you're not special enough and I'm the kind of person if you tell me you can't do something
*03:53.340- 03:58.840* :  or something that's impossible that's exactly what I have to do. Harry what made you want to help her?
*03:59.040- 04:05.360* :  Why not? I mean I try to help everybody I can't you know it's my nature I've helped in my life
*04:05.360- 04:13.080* :  and if I can help people I'll do it and this is one of the most gratifying experiences of my life.
*04:13.180- 04:19.740* :  This is a very very talented young woman. Uter taught me through the moment when you realized that
*04:19.740- 04:26.160* :  Harry would be able to help you get into your ultimate dream school. I remember him saying you know
*04:26.340- 04:31.240* :  every day he says what are you doing here at this place you know I was doing like every day
*04:31.240- 04:36.500* :  resort work and he he said to me and he was the first one to ever say this he said you're you're
*04:36.500- 04:44.440* :  made to do great things and you know I never had that before I never have. Harry it's clear that you've
*04:44.440- 04:52.740* :  had such a big impact on Uter's life. It's always felt great it's always felt great. Well I don't
*04:52.980- 04:58.920* :  go out of my way to look for things like that but if people ask me for help and I it's within my
*04:58.920- 05:08.060* :  capability and my power to help them I'll do it. It was really a turning moment for me that I was
*05:08.740- 05:15.160* :  not being told something is impossible or I can't do it or I'm not good enough. I kind of felt my
*05:15.160- 05:21.920* :  world was broken open and the sun came in. You must be such a resilient person to keep fighting
*05:21.920- 05:27.800* :  for your dream when you are being told that you can't do it by other people. Well my mother
*05:27.800- 05:34.560* :  actually taught me this when I was about seven eight years old you always have to have a wish list
*05:34.560- 05:39.720* :  in your life always have something on that list that you want that you want to achieve. You should
*05:39.720- 05:45.320* :  always keep a wish list you should always want something when those opportunities in life open up
*05:45.320- 05:52.380* :  like meeting Harry. Has this experience of being helped made you want to pay it forward? Do you feel
*05:52.380- 05:59.140* :  like you want to help people the way Harry helped you? Oh absolutely absolutely my and I have a
*05:59.140- 06:06.400* :  coaching business but what I most passionately love to do is help people find their authenticity
*06:06.400- 06:12.560* :  because people often don't know all the power they have and that's what makes me happy. How is your
*06:12.560- 06:18.980* :  decision to be kind all those years ago changed your life? Well I mean I gained a dear friend
*06:18.980- 06:26.800* :  a dear friend for life I'd like to say something about the quote unquote anonymous donor. He didn't
*06:26.800- 06:33.840* :  want anything in return for what he was doing. He was just helping people. We need more of people
*06:33.840- 06:39.740* :  like that in the world. Utah what would you say to your younger self? All of your dream always
*06:40.400- 06:47.000* :  all of your dream don't let other people convince you your dream is not relevant don't give up
*06:47.400- 06:54.560* :  and when the opportunity comes your way and it will just grab it. You say that you speak to each
*06:54.560- 07:00.500* :  other every July the 4th which is the day you met and as we are speaking it is July the 4th
*07:00.920- 07:07.620* :  what would you like to say to each other? I think Utah is a shining example of
*07:08.060- 07:13.700* :  that you're children in the grindstone work work work and use your talents to the best of your
*07:13.700- 07:21.220* :  abilities and you will succeed. Everybody has something they can give to others. Everybody can
*07:21.220- 07:26.460* :  make somebody else's life a little bit better. You just have to have the guts to go out and do it
*07:26.800- 07:32.360* :  and if you start at once you know it's infectious you just keep you just keep doing it.
*07:33.360- 07:37.640* :  Now to an inspiring young Kenyan woman who's using technology to help traditional farming
*07:37.640- 07:42.980* :  communities like the one she grew up in. Esther Kamani whose invention uses artificial intelligence
*07:42.980- 07:47.180* :  to improve crop yields is the latest winner of Africa's biggest engineering prize.
*07:48.880- 07:54.440* :  So on on the basis of the technology they're great prospects for becoming a very successful
*07:54.440- 08:02.420* :  business with a huge impact. The 10th winner of the Royal Academy of Engineering Africa prize
*08:02.420- 08:14.980* :  for engineering innovation. Taking home Â£50,000 is the third woman to win the prize Esther Kamani.
*08:18.080- 08:21.280* :  Well done Esther now she says she's hoping to use the prize money to bring the technology
*08:21.280- 08:26.600* :  to a million farmers over the next five years and she told Maira Anubi what motivated her.
*08:27.360- 08:32.860* :  I was born in a farming community. Our livelihoods were really affected because at least a third of
*08:32.860- 08:39.700* :  our crops were destroyed by pests and diseases. A third is a lot especially when you look at
*08:39.700- 08:47.840* :  subsistence farming where they depend 100% on the produce of those farms for the school fees,
*08:47.840- 08:54.160* :  medical care. So that would really hurt me when I see that because I had to go through that.
*08:54.360- 08:59.540* :  And I was privileged to even make it through education to study at a green computer science
*08:59.680- 09:07.160* :  and I knew I was leaving home to change home. How exactly does your innovation work?
*09:08.200- 09:14.600* :  We assemble AI enabled cameras. So when they're mounted on farms they're able to compare
*09:15.300- 09:21.000* :  what is on the ground and what has been pre-trained and they can distinguish between a healthy
*09:21.000- 09:29.240* :  and an infested crop. And that way they again leverage another AI algorithm to now pick out the
*09:29.240- 09:35.060* :  specific pests, pick out the disease and recommend what this farmer should apply and the exact
*09:35.060- 09:40.120* :  quantities. Now the most interesting part is how that is communicated to the farmer because it
*09:40.120- 09:49.300* :  can be very complex botanical names. So you have to break that down to a simple SMS and even in local
*09:49.300- 09:55.760* :  language to recommend the pesticide that they need to apply and the exact quantities. And there
*09:55.760- 10:02.980* :  was a natural ways of controlling some of these pests. Maybe mixing just liquid soap and some water
*10:03.300- 10:08.580* :  or ash could be used to control effort and letting the crops. Without damaging the crops and at the
*10:08.580- 10:14.140* :  same time ensuring that the food being produced is healthy. How much does this cost the farmers?
*10:15.240- 10:23.060* :  We only charge farmers $3 a month, a leasing fee. They don't buy the devices. So the current
*10:23.060- 10:30.020* :  cameras that we have, the span of a farm that they can cover, 600 meters, it can sell at least
*10:30.020- 10:36.480* :  three farmers. So the three of them each pay the three dollars. And you said self farmers,
*10:36.480- 10:43.080* :  how many farmers are using your device currently? We have over 5,000 small older farmers in Kenya,
*10:43.380- 10:51.000* :  60% being women. And the reason why we also focused towards that is because they are quite
*10:51.700- 10:57.940* :  marginalized. I can see you're very proud about that. Yes, I am. Actually for this one who is not
*10:57.940- 11:03.980* :  owning the farm and having to see losses and that's where they work all day, it's devastating.
*11:04.060- 11:11.220* :  So it's just good that we also keep them in mind. Now for these 5,000 farmers that you're working with,
*11:11.280- 11:16.100* :  what kind of difference has this made so far? The change that we've seen has been incredible.
*11:17.120- 11:25.260* :  We've seen increasing yields of over 40%. We've seen reduction in losses at least 40%.
*11:26.060- 11:30.400* :  For us when we see increased yields, when we see reduced crop losses, when we see improved
*11:30.400- 11:37.660* :  livelihoods, lives changed, young girls like myself being able to access education and basic
*11:37.660- 11:42.800* :  needs. I don't think there's something that can be more encouraging than that. And you can
*11:42.800- 11:47.200* :  hear more about Esther and the other innovations that were shortlisted on people fixing the world.
*11:47.200- 11:52.660* :  That's wherever you get your podcasts. Next, some of the biggest museums in Europe have invited
*11:52.660- 11:56.060* :  Asian celebrities to record audio guides for their exhibitions.
*12:09.500- 12:13.680* :  Yes, that canto pop singer is just one of the number of East Asian stars being used to attract
*12:13.680- 12:19.520* :  tourists to major museums in Europe. Our China media analyst Kerialan explained who was involved
*12:19.520- 12:25.200* :  and why. There's a Chinese actress and singer called Zhu Zhu. She's actually appeared in some
*12:25.200- 12:30.700* :  international films like Cloud Atlas and the Netflix series Marco Polo. She's now going to be an
*12:30.700- 12:41.540* :  audio guide in Mandarin for the Bogey Gallery in Italy. And she's an audio guide for an
*12:41.540- 12:46.280* :  exhibition that's launched at the beginning of July, which features the French American artist
*12:46.280- 12:51.400* :  Louise Bourgeois. And so you can hear her if you're a speaker or listener of Mandarin,
*12:51.400- 12:56.980* :  telling you about the various artworks and the emotions that they capture. So that's one artist.
*12:56.980- 13:02.160* :  There's also a Hong Kong singer and actress called Karen Mock. She's lent a voice to English
*13:02.160- 13:07.700* :  Cantonese and Mandarin audio guides for an exhibition at the Hong Kong Palace Museum. And then
*13:07.700- 13:13.160* :  yet the big, the big name that's attracted a lot of K-pop fans, so fans in China, also South Korea
*13:13.160- 13:19.280* :  and all over the world. The band New Jeans have recorded an audio introduction for the Korean
*13:19.280- 13:30.120* :  gallery at the British gallery. And even if you can't speak Korean, there have been people who are
*13:30.120- 13:42.340* :  just so excited about this. They've been downloading the audio app. Because there's money involved
*13:42.340- 13:47.500* :  isn't there. So for the actual galleries and museums, it's a very good way of actually making
*13:47.500- 13:53.000* :  a little bit of extra profit. It is absolutely. And I think long-term, you know, there have been
*13:53.000- 13:59.460* :  these perceptions from some people that museums, art galleries can be kind of dull, but these are
*13:59.460- 14:05.720* :  exhibitions that feature artworks, fashion. And these are stars that are very attractive to young
*14:05.720- 14:10.780* :  audiences. So it's a way of more or less having a friend in your ears when you go round these
*14:10.780- 14:15.980* :  exhibitions. And you almost feel like you're getting a voice from back home, being able to communicate
*14:16.060- 14:22.120* :  a similar understanding of the kinds of things you're seeing. I get why people would be interested
*14:22.120- 14:26.980* :  in fans of the big artists, but why do you think that the big artists are lending their voices to
*14:26.980- 14:32.160* :  the museums? Because like you just said, they can't be being paid huge sums of money to record
*14:32.160- 14:36.660* :  these audio guides. So I'm guessing it's more like a kudos thing for them. Well a lot has been
*14:36.660- 14:41.100* :  written on how actually it's it's a big interest. And those that we know about who are doing this,
*14:41.100- 14:47.180* :  New Jeans, Karen Mark and Joel, that they've all spoken previously of their interest in art,
*14:47.180- 14:52.140* :  in particular. And so that's one of the reasons that for them it's interesting.
*14:55.700- 15:01.100* :  I know it's quite early days, but do you sense that there is a real tangible boost in the numbers
*15:01.100- 15:07.220* :  for the actual gallery? It's too early to say to speak about the Chinese and the Hong Kong artists
*15:07.220- 15:12.060* :  that are doing this, but certainly with New Jeans launching their Korean audio guide for the
*15:12.060- 15:18.580* :  British Museum. And the Museum's app has skyrocketed tenfold in downloads since it was launched.
*15:27.940- 15:31.920* :  Well now to an extraordinary story about a little girl who saved her mother's life.
*15:31.920- 15:37.180* :  When Lisa Davis passed out on her bedroom floor in South Wales, her five-year-old daughter
*15:37.180- 15:42.300* :  Poppy stayed by her side all night. Then in the morning she walked to school to tell her teacher
*15:42.300- 15:50.100* :  that she couldn't wake her up. Nelly Bird spoke to them both. Oh my hero, yeah. Oh I love you.
*15:50.400- 15:56.780* :  Poppy is a lively and typical five-year-old girl, but earlier this year she did something completely
*15:56.780- 16:02.420* :  remarkable. Dad Ryan was at work and she was home alone with her memlesia who'd been feeling
*16:02.420- 16:08.040* :  well for a few weeks after having an operation. I collapsed on the floor, she killed it beside me
*16:08.040- 16:12.520* :  in the night and slept beside me. So in the morning then she waited for the school to open.
*16:12.960- 16:16.620* :  She got her wellies on and she got her little crown on and she was in a princess dress.
*16:16.620- 16:22.200* :  My daughter was is distinctive. It's got flowers on it so she identified that. She went out
*16:22.240- 16:27.320* :  out of my door then and she went in through the school gates because I live right behind the school
*16:28.020- 16:32.060* :  and she went into the classroom and told her teachers that mommy's on the floor and she can't
*16:32.060- 16:39.260* :  can't wake her up. I was in my room and then she's laying on the floor because I can't wake her up.
*16:39.460- 16:45.360* :  What was it like going to school by yourself? It's just so scary. You know you've got a lump in
*16:45.360- 16:51.400* :  your throat and you think oh god what did she go through? I just can't adequately know what she
*16:51.400- 16:58.800* :  went through but I did find selfies on my phone and that she'd take that morning. So yeah I think
*16:58.800- 17:05.480* :  she was okay. I think she was alright because I was still there so I think to her because she
*17:05.480- 17:09.700* :  is only five. I think you know with me being on the floor I was still there anyway.
*17:10.500- 17:15.600* :  Leisha was rushed to hospital. She was in septic shock and her body was shutting down.
*17:15.600- 17:21.540* :  After a month fighting for her life she woke up from her coma. She hears my hero and she's saved
*17:21.620- 17:26.560* :  mommy's life and we always underestimate children and I think you know I'd never thought that she
*17:26.560- 17:29.940* :  would do anything and I'll be she dead and I'm really glad.
*17:35.400- 17:39.340* :  Still to come in this podcast Indonesia's hijab wearing metalheads.
*17:42.460- 17:48.680* :  At first it's hard it's hard to get support from our parents like they say it's
*17:49.000- 17:51.420* :  shatanic music evil music.
*18:04.900- 18:07.320* :  Even when we're on a budget we still deserve nice things.

*19:22.740- 19:27.640* :  younger I would have jumped at the chance or possibly tried to ollie at the chance. Now though
*19:27.640- 19:32.360* :  teenagers in Northern Ireland are the first in the world to be offered the chance to pass a test
*19:32.360- 19:42.100* :  in the sport. Alex Ritson has been investigating. It's really easy from my perspective because I'd
*19:42.100- 19:46.300* :  already been skating but for someone who hasn't been skating it might be a little bit harder.
*19:46.300- 19:52.660* :  You have to do a few tricks and then just knowledge about the sport as well. That's Theo Hamilton.
*19:52.660- 19:59.180* :  He goes to a boarding school in East Belfast and when I say boarding school I mean an ordinary
*19:59.180- 20:05.680* :  school where one of the options for GCSE the big set of UK exams you take at 16 to the envy of
*20:05.680- 20:11.300* :  his friends is now skateboarding. They think it's pretty cool they think it's they're a bit surprised
*20:11.300- 20:16.780* :  that it's like something that I could do in the school as well. We have a skate school which they
*20:16.780- 20:21.940* :  teach the junior school of Campbell College. It's great. It's all the brainchild of teacher and
*20:21.940- 20:27.080* :  skater Jared Purvis who had the idea during the covid lockdown and managed to persuade the local
*20:27.080- 20:32.320* :  exam board to let him put together an official course. Made loads of phone calls from the
*20:32.320- 20:36.200* :  reception the whole way up till I find the right person that was I can speak to about it. He sent
*20:36.200- 20:42.860* :  me templates for similar sports with the assessment criteria and stuff like that and then I just
*20:42.920- 20:46.720* :  sort of pretty much put my own knowledge to a template and sort of formulated and made the
*20:46.720- 20:51.860* :  skateboard GCSE curriculum from up. You must have had to convince an awful lot of skeptical people
*20:51.860- 20:57.100* :  along the way. Actually believe it or not. No actually the I don't know what happened. I just
*20:57.320- 21:02.680* :  got the right man who was in charge at the right time and he was not skeptical at all. I think
*21:02.680- 21:07.640* :  to be honest it probably helped that I think he had recently watched the Olympics were skybrown
*21:07.640- 21:11.780* :  on the metal and I think he once he'd saw that he just knew that this was you know this was a
*21:11.780- 21:17.460* :  real sport and that any preconceived notions were dull and void. What's involved in this course?
*21:17.980- 21:22.760* :  Pretty much all of the basic things that you would need to know to be classified as you know a
*21:22.760- 21:26.280* :  skateboarder like you need to know how to take your skate how to fix your own skateboard everyone
*21:26.280- 21:30.640* :  knows every skater if you want the skate park would have an idea of how to do that and then basic
*21:30.640- 21:36.240* :  maneuvers not like really advanced tricks just sort of all the basic core essentials the building
*21:36.240- 21:41.460* :  blocks for taking it further they can video themselves and make a videoography of like sort of all
*21:41.460- 21:45.940* :  these different tricks you know them doing them and that's also proof of them doing all the tricks.
*21:45.940- 21:52.400* :  Tell me the names. I love the names. Well there's a there's a slasher, there's a drop-in,
*21:52.400- 21:59.920* :  there's a rock to fakie, there's Ollie. Where does this take you though? What's the career after this?
*22:00.320- 22:05.880* :  It's hard to say because like in my local skate park I have like a load of people with
*22:06.300- 22:11.200* :  different careers you know they could either follow their dreams it's it's very hard you know you
*22:11.200- 22:14.900* :  need to be very talented like any sort of sports individual but you know they could follow their
*22:14.900- 22:21.100* :  dreams and go and try to make it in wedding competitions and get sponsors and become like sort of
*22:21.100- 22:27.140* :  more of a professional athlete in that sense and in the end this makes you happy. Yeah oh yeah
*22:27.320- 22:32.300* :  literally last night I was teaching this girl my advanced sort of children's class and she's been
*22:32.300- 22:36.380* :  trying to Ollie for a while and she can Ollie but she can't it's a mental block of like trying
*22:36.380- 22:40.900* :  to jump over something doing it like on a certain time constraint with something approaching and
*22:40.900- 22:46.280* :  you have to do it at the right time to clear it and do it nicely without falling off and last
*22:46.280- 22:48.800* :  night she did it and you're there for those people mentioned where you're just like and you know
*22:48.800- 22:51.960* :  like I sort of get the hype again like feels like when I when I did it for the first time.
*22:52.320- 22:57.340* :  An escape boarding isn't your thing other options are increasingly available around the world.
*22:57.340- 23:03.000* :  Chess is a mandatory school subject in Armenia for all children over the age of six and teenagers in
*23:03.000- 23:09.460* :  the US state of Hawaii can spend their school hours learning to surf. Well you're never too old to
*23:09.460- 23:14.300* :  learn something new maybe skateboarding or surfing for me sounds good but it's not just humans
*23:14.300- 23:19.760* :  who like to learn. A study published in the journal Plus Biology suggests that chimpanzees
*23:19.780- 23:24.240* :  may also like to constantly improve their skills. Terry Egan has this report.
*23:29.440- 23:34.560* :  Of all the non-human animals chimpanzees are some of the most adept at using tools.
*23:34.560- 23:41.720* :  The researchers here looked at 70 wild chimps of various ages using sticks to retrieve food
*23:41.720- 23:48.600* :  at Thai National Park in Ivory Coast. They analyzed video recordings of the primates collected
*23:48.600- 23:55.080* :  from the site over several years focusing on how the animals became more skilled at using the sticks
*23:55.080- 24:02.500* :  to extract foods such as larvae and nut kernels. They examined the way the chimps inserted the sticks
*24:03.000- 24:10.020* :  used them to prod cavities employed them to stir or pound or deploy them in a spoon-like way.
*24:10.900- 24:17.900* :  Mathieu Malurb led the study humans we are able to learn new things but with technical abilities
*24:17.900- 24:22.760* :  using technologies using tools this is something that was thought to be very unique to humans and
*24:22.760- 24:28.580* :  what we bring here with our studies to show that chimpanzees are also able like to learn when
*24:28.580- 24:33.820* :  they are adults and to be flexible with their to use behaviour. The researchers said the
*24:33.820- 24:39.740* :  motor skills of the chimps were well developed by the age of six and they were easily able to grip
*24:39.740- 24:45.420* :  the tools in different ways but they also noticed they were skilled at compensating for the
*24:45.420- 24:52.500* :  limitations in their hand movements by using alternative grips so as to apply pressure and precision.
*24:53.060- 24:58.320* :  Perfecting these skills say the researchers involves far more than just physical development
*24:59.060- 25:05.340* :  and the chimps continue to learn over a long period constantly adapting and improving their
*25:05.340- 25:15.060* :  techniques just as we strive to do. Well earlier we heard how Harry's kindness changed
*25:15.060- 25:20.420* :  uter's life but even small actions can make a huge difference as we heard from one of our team.
*25:21.320- 25:26.360* :  Hi, happy pod. It's your colleague Tracy at home in southwest London and I have a story that made
*25:26.360- 25:31.640* :  me smile this week. I was shopping in a supermarket and when I went to the till the cashier asked
*25:31.640- 25:37.160* :  me a question but when I went to reply I struggled to find my words. It's one of my unpredictable
*25:37.160- 25:43.160* :  multiple sclerosis symptoms. I paid and was walking away when she called me back and was waving
*25:43.160- 25:49.340* :  a pose of right freezers. I automatically said they aren't mine. With a huge smile she said they
*25:49.340- 25:57.160* :  are yours and given them to you. I left the shop with a beaming smile. It made my day my week my month.
*25:58.320- 26:02.820* :  Our friend and colleague Tracy Gordon and if you have a small act of kindness that you like to share
*26:02.820- 26:09.840* :  with us do send us a voice note or an email. The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*26:11.340- 26:15.740* :  And now to a heavy metal band with a difference. Voice of Batcha Prott,
*26:16.040- 26:20.780* :  they're a female trio who wear hijabs and come from Indonesia and they found success after
*26:20.780- 26:25.900* :  overcoming hostility in their home village where people said they were making music for the devil.
*26:26.540- 26:30.540* :  They've just become the first Indonesian band to play at Europe's largest music festival
*26:30.540- 26:35.360* :  Glastonbury in western England. Stephanie Prentice has been finding out more about them.
*26:36.200- 26:40.760* :  Hello, we are FI-O-V, Voice of Batcha Prott.
*26:42.860- 26:47.760* :  Known for their heavy metal style, Islamic headsgarves and socially conscious lyrics,
*26:48.260- 26:53.220* :  voice of Batcha Prott to an old female trio who formed in a village in Indonesia where their
*26:53.220- 26:58.840* :  music caused concern. They come from West Java which is among the more conservative provinces
*26:59.460- 27:02.720* :  and includes denominations that forbid music and singing.
*27:02.860- 27:13.840* :  At first, it's hard to get support from our parents especially because they didn't
*27:13.840- 27:19.580* :  know anything about metal music like they say it's satanic music, evil music.
*27:22.140- 27:28.900* :  But we prove that we are okay to play music and still be a good girl.
*27:31.780- 27:36.220* :  They kept making music through high school, ignoring the suggestion of one of their families
*27:36.220- 27:42.740* :  that they undergo in Islamic healing ritual and now they've made history performing at Glastonbury
*27:42.740- 27:47.540* :  music festival in England alongside global stars like Colkley and Dua Lipa.
*27:49.320- 27:54.480* :  The band said they want to tackle topical issues like female empowerment but performing
*27:54.480- 27:57.720* :  wearing a traditional hijab has made them a target.
*28:03.660- 28:11.420* :  They said it's not acceptable for a Muslim like us to play heavy metal music.
*28:12.060- 28:17.600* :  They only see metal as a symbol of the darkness.
*28:19.520- 28:22.220* :  As well as advocating for their right to express themselves,
*28:22.220- 28:27.300* :  the band said they want to challenge the stereotypes that Muslim women are demure or weak
*28:27.300- 28:33.020* :  or that Muslims in general are militants, something that hecklers shouted at them when they sang
*28:33.020- 28:34.180* :  in the United States.
*28:38.500- 28:43.060* :  And now as well as taking their music all around the world, the band have another goal,
*28:43.300- 28:44.440* :  back where they started.
*28:45.180- 28:49.800* :  We build studio in our hometown now. That's one of our biggest dreams.
*28:50.800- 28:55.120* :  A dream she hopes will inspire Indonesia's next generation of musicians.
*29:01.200- 29:05.000* :  The music of Voice of Batcha Pratt ending that report by Stephanie Prentice.
