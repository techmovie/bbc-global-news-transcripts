*01:19.380- 01:22.640* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.260- 01:29.860* :  I'm Andrew Patron at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday the 30th of July. These are our main stories.
*01:29.980- 01:35.080* :  A series of devastating landslides in southern India has killed more than 90 people
*01:35.480- 01:40.580* :  as officials warned many more victims remain trapped. Protests continue across Benner's
*01:40.580- 01:45.460* :  wailer against the re-election of President Nicholas Maduro, which the opposition says was rigged.
*01:46.020- 01:50.560* :  At the Paris Olympics, athletes have expressed frustration after the men's triathlon was
*01:50.560- 01:56.880* :  postponed because of pollution in the river Sen. Also in this podcast, the World Health
*01:56.880- 02:01.300* :  Organization says injured and critically ill Palestinians, including many children,
*02:01.600- 02:05.000* :  are on their way from Gaza to the United Arab Emirates for treatment.
*02:16.580- 02:20.820* :  Away from the Olympics, we'll look at some of the bizarre races that make up a list of alternative
*02:20.820- 02:27.340* :  sports and the slow demise of the landline. What impact is the transition to mobile technology
*02:27.980- 02:28.720* :  having on our brains?
*02:32.080- 02:36.360* :  The government in the Indian State of Kerala has declared two days of mourning after more than
*02:36.360- 02:42.340* :  90 people were killed in a series of landslides. Heavy rain turned rivers into muddy torrents,
*02:42.340- 02:48.220* :  sweeping away trees and vehicles and submerging buildings. Soldiers have been deployed to help with
*02:48.220- 02:53.360* :  the rescue effort. It's thought the number of casualties will rise further, as our Delhi Correspondence
*02:53.360- 02:59.200* :  Samira Hussain told Lucy Hockings. People expect that that number is actually going to go up. They're
*02:59.200- 03:07.360* :  saying about 250 people have been injured so far and they have the Indian navy in the rescue
*03:07.360- 03:13.320* :  attempts. You also have members of the Indian Army that are also involved in the rescue operations.
*03:13.340- 03:19.700* :  What's really making it all really difficult is of course that it continues to reign there and
*03:19.700- 03:25.920* :  it was those rains that triggered the three consecutive landslides very early in the morning
*03:25.920- 03:34.240* :  Tuesday here in India. Now they're trying to reach those communities that are basically cut off
*03:34.360- 03:39.060* :  from other parts of the region. There's a critical bridge that connected one area that
*03:39.140- 03:44.520* :  suffered a landslide and that has been destroyed and so the army is actually building a rope bridge
*03:44.520- 03:52.600* :  to try and reach some of those that are stranded. Officials there believe that many people may have
*03:52.600- 03:58.460* :  been swept into those rivers that have become really swollen and muddy and just become trapped
*03:58.460- 04:04.700* :  under that water. So really now the race is on to try and get to some of those people that are
*04:04.700- 04:10.660* :  stranded behind those mudslides. And Samira this is an area of Kerala that is prone to heavy rain
*04:10.660- 04:16.800* :  and flooding so they are familiar in some ways with what needs to happen now. Right so the state of
*04:16.800- 04:22.700* :  Kerala is in the southern part of India and parts of it are of course coastal but if you go more
*04:22.700- 04:29.440* :  inwards into the state you get to this sort of lush green hilly area. There's lots of tier states
*04:29.440- 04:37.080* :  and cardamom estates in this area so it does see these kinds of landslides are flooding rather
*04:37.080- 04:43.160* :  especially in the monsoon season which we're in right now and so they have seen that back in 2018
*04:43.160- 04:48.820* :  more than 400 people died you know that was considered some of the worst flooding that the area
*04:48.820- 04:53.980* :  has seen in a century so it is an area that sees this but if you compare it to the last few years
*04:54.060- 04:57.600* :  they haven't seen something quite as deadly as this one. Samira has seen.
*04:58.580- 05:03.640* :  The weather is continuing to cause problems for the Paris Olympics. The men's triathlon was due
*05:03.640- 05:09.080* :  to be underway by now but it's been postponed. Too much rain has caused pollution in the river Sen.
*05:09.080- 05:14.240* :  This is an ongoing problem with training sessions already cancelled for the past two days.
*05:15.060- 05:19.380* :  Dan Angelescu is the founder and chief executive of Fluidium which has been working with the
*05:19.380- 05:24.500* :  authorities in Paris on the water quality in the Sen. He says the sewage infrastructure has been
*05:24.500- 05:30.760* :  overwhelmed by the amount of rain. The water quality still depends a lot on the rainfall
*05:31.340- 05:36.740* :  in the sense that there has been all this infrastructure that cost a lot of money that was built
*05:36.820- 05:42.780* :  but it has a certain capacity and what we notice and this is really groundbreaking because we are
*05:42.780- 05:50.380* :  noticing it live is that we had two rain events since the opening of this capture basin that's
*05:50.380- 05:55.780* :  supposed to capture all the overflow. There have been two rain events that overcame the capacity
*05:55.780- 06:01.620* :  of this structure so the river was polluted and it was polluted in Paris and most likely also
*06:01.620- 06:06.620* :  upstream. Some athletes in the triathlon and other river-based events have expressed their
*06:06.620- 06:12.220* :  unhappiness about the continued uncertainty as they try to prepare to compete. These spectators in
*06:12.220- 06:17.180* :  the French capital say they're disappointed. The idea is pretty good and I think the whole thing
*06:17.180- 06:22.620* :  is pretty good to do a lot for the water quality for the city. When you look further on and say okay
*06:23.300- 06:28.980* :  people can swim as the same that is one of the ideas what I read it's a good idea but for the day
*06:29.100- 06:33.820* :  it's a little bit disappointed. We're very excited to see this triathlon but yeah we've just
*06:33.820- 06:39.600* :  found out that it's been cancelled sadly so disappointed but yeah hopefully you say it's going to be
*06:39.600- 06:45.280* :  on tomorrow so maybe we'll come back tomorrow. So what happens if the water quality doesn't improve?
*06:45.280- 06:50.200* :  Will the men's and women's triathlon events be cancelled? Here's our Paris correspondent Andrew
*06:50.200- 06:57.240* :  Harding. If nothing happens positively in terms of the tests that they will do and will announce
*06:57.240- 07:05.100* :  early tomorrow morning then there is one last chance which is Friday for both the men's and the women's
*07:05.440- 07:10.040* :  triathlon but there is a distinct possibility by then that there will have been more rain and
*07:10.040- 07:14.860* :  therefore there is the danger of more pollution having been washed in and that the real problem and
*07:15.100- 07:20.020* :  the reason why I think athletes have expressed some frustration even anger according to one French
*07:20.020- 07:26.140* :  report about the situation is there is no plan B there is no backup venue so if it doesn't happen
*07:26.140- 07:32.580* :  here it will not be a triathlon it will be a duathlon which simply doesn't count for Olympic
*07:32.580- 07:38.940* :  goals and so on in the same way so a huge amount of stake for the athletes men and women who
*07:39.480- 07:44.940* :  should have been in the same here this morning and we know that the water quality of the river has
*07:44.940- 07:50.380* :  been too poor for people to swim in for a long time so perhaps it was just too big an ask to
*07:50.380- 07:59.620* :  clean it up. Well this is a 10 year project and 1.2 or 3 billion euros of investment in terms of
*07:59.620- 08:04.900* :  diverting sewage pipes chemical pipes and also building a giant what they call an underwater
*08:04.900- 08:11.240* :  cathedral to store excess rain water but the trouble and this is what a lot of the organizers and
*08:11.240- 08:16.220* :  experts are pointing at is frankly climate change the weather is becoming more intense rainfall
*08:16.220- 08:22.020* :  more unpredictable and it means that despite the investment and despite all the planning
*08:23.120- 08:28.420* :  it's simply very hard to predict when the rain is going to hit and in the sort of quantities that
*08:28.420- 08:32.660* :  it's you know the powers has experienced in recent days which I guess is why normally these
*08:33.040- 08:37.680* :  events take place in more controlled environments than the open river that the rain is now giving
*08:37.680- 08:44.720* :  way to a heatwave I understand. It's sweltering it's 34 degrees here right now I think it's going to be
*08:45.200- 08:50.400* :  the same or or hotter all over France today but then it will break and it'll be a bit cooler
*08:50.840- 08:56.640* :  in the coming days. Andrew Harding with me from Paris the town of Southport in the north
*08:56.640- 09:02.420* :  west of England is in mourning three children and our confirmed dead and another five as well as
*09:02.420- 09:07.480* :  two adults remain in a critical condition in hospital after a mass stabbing attack that turn
*09:07.480- 09:13.140* :  the summer holiday dance event into a scene of carnage a 17 year old male arrested on suspicion
*09:13.200- 09:18.140* :  of murder remains in custody Stephanie Power has been to the area and talked to people there.
*09:19.260- 09:27.640* :  If somebody asked you to describe Southport in three words you would say Victorian seaside resort
*09:29.000- 09:37.440* :  there's lots and lots of Victorian houses from small terraces to semi-detached to huge detached
*09:37.440- 09:45.320* :  buildings the sun shining and it kind of looked just like it might always do on a Monday night
*09:45.940- 09:52.440* :  people are sitting outside you almost would think that nothing has really happened here I just
*09:52.660- 09:59.300* :  I've just can hear your listening to BBC News on your phone there nothing like this has ever
*09:59.300- 10:05.920* :  happened so it's very strange and upsetting that's why I think so many people listening probably
*10:06.420- 10:10.660* :  I was home alone and I could hear the helicopters and I was like I don't want to be by myself
*10:10.700- 10:16.360* :  just in case because we didn't know if there was anybody else that was involved so you're going
*10:16.360- 10:25.080* :  to go to the gym and just try and carry on be normal because there's nothing we can do apart from
*10:25.080- 10:34.080* :  just hope that everybody's okay aside from all the other journalists around I noticed lots of
*10:34.080- 10:44.100* :  vickers and chaplains here to offer support there are no words for this I mean it's just unbelievable
*10:45.260- 10:50.760* :  what's happened here all I can say was as I said in Welsh that Jesus is crying as well
*10:51.320- 10:57.940* :  you just can't imagine that life will just go be taken like that and the effect on other children
*10:57.940- 11:04.180* :  effect on the owner of the lives it's that sort of thing isn't it where it's an ordinary day until it's
*11:04.180- 11:11.780* :  not an ordinary day exactly and this day will this will remain and it'll in air can upset generations
*11:11.780- 11:19.040* :  of children that somebody could do this but the community I mean it's lovely to see you know
*11:19.040- 11:25.060* :  British men are supposed to be a bit tight left but the man tall men are coming here with bunches
*11:25.060- 11:30.980* :  of flowers and that's lovely Emily Spurrow I'm the Merceside Police and Crime Commissioner
*11:31.840- 11:37.580* :  you were talking quite a lot about people worrying about people making assumptions yeah I mean is
*11:37.580- 11:43.220* :  that actually quite a serious problem because there's I've noticed there's some people doing their
*11:43.220- 11:49.340* :  own reporting on Facebook live making all sorts of announcements yeah how difficult is that
*11:50.400- 11:54.680* :  it definitely poses a challenge I think you know I would really just urge people to go for the
*11:54.680- 11:58.720* :  official channels this is a really complicated investigation the police don't believe they're
*11:58.720- 12:01.980* :  looking for anybody else at the minute but obviously they're still doing the work trying to
*12:01.980- 12:06.520* :  try and understand what the motivation was and how we got to this point so you know when people
*12:06.520- 12:11.120* :  start trying to throw out other other ideas or start trying to stir up you know sentiment in an
*12:11.120- 12:15.660* :  unhelpful way all that does is divert resources away from the police being able to actually invest
*12:15.660- 12:20.520* :  in getting justice for the children and the families who have suffered so I would just really urge
*12:20.520- 12:25.240* :  people to let the police do their job the facts will come out when they come out and then you know we
*12:25.240- 12:28.520* :  can have a discussion about you know what that means and how we might prevent something like this
*12:28.520- 12:33.720* :  from happening again the children attacked were at a Taylor Swift theme dance class and the US
*12:33.720- 12:38.720* :  singer has posted on Instagram saying the horror of the attack was washing over her continuously
*12:38.720- 12:45.580* :  and she was completely in shock it took the supporters of the Venezuelan opposition just one day
*12:45.580- 12:49.680* :  to take to the streets to protest against the official result of the presidential election
*12:50.200- 12:54.520* :  the incumbent Nicholas Maduro has been declared the winner by the opposition and many foreign
*12:54.520- 12:59.720* :  governments have denounced that as fraudulent the protesters were met with tear gas and rubber bullets
*13:00.280- 13:05.240* :  Catherine Ellis is a former BBC journalist now working in Venezuela she told us what she'd seen
*13:05.880- 13:10.240* :  people started walking from the mountains one of the very poor neighborhoods in the east of the
*13:10.240- 13:15.580* :  city and they started walking to the center of the city now I came across them by chance I started
*13:15.580- 13:22.580* :  walking with them a lot of motorcycles as well people were flags the atmosphere was jubilant in
*13:22.580- 13:27.740* :  some ways but people were getting angry as well at that point I actually got caught with a group
*13:27.740- 13:33.860* :  of people between two groups of the military now some of the people were actually starting to pick up
*13:33.860- 13:38.580* :  rocks from the ground and starting to throw them towards buildings and starting to throw them towards
*13:38.580- 13:44.280* :  police as well there was tear gas and the police did start shooting rubber bullets as well one girl
*13:44.280- 13:48.380* :  in front of me was screaming please don't shoot me please don't shoot me now the police and the
*13:48.380- 13:52.780* :  military were trying to disperse the crowds but people didn't know what was happening I found
*13:52.780- 13:59.620* :  on the latest from Jorge Peres from BBC Monday a lot of expectation and a lot of tension in the
*13:59.620- 14:04.700* :  country not only in the capital but throughout the countryside because it is expected today that
*14:04.700- 14:11.200* :  the government is calling its supporters to go to the street to celebrate as they said the Maduro's
*14:11.200- 14:17.840* :  disputed victory but there is also this question whether the anti-government protests that
*14:17.840- 14:24.260* :  spontaneously happened yesterday are going to occur today as well right so choreographed
*14:24.260- 14:30.720* :  celebrations continuing protests real possibility of violent clashes there is a curious fact the
*14:30.720- 14:34.240* :  government is calling for example in the city of Caracas a capital the government is calling
*14:34.240- 14:39.300* :  its supporters to start marching from Petare Petare is one of the biggest slums not only
*14:39.300- 14:43.640* :  in Venezuela but in Latin America where we saw some of the images yesterday from protesters
*14:43.640- 14:48.660* :  anti-government protesters and the government is also calling its supporters to depart from
*14:48.660- 14:53.960* :  there to march towards a presidential palace so it is an open question are they going to be clashes
*14:53.960- 14:58.240* :  we are going to see that in the upcoming hours the opposition of the government for that matter
*14:59.080- 15:03.680* :  asking the authorities in Caracas to show us you working show us the tally show us the votes
*15:04.320- 15:10.560* :  to prove that the outcome of this election is accurate are they going to do that well it is not
*15:10.560- 15:15.800* :  only a request of the opposition leaders it's also a request from many of the government into
*15:15.800- 15:21.340* :  region and we have seen a reaction from Maduro's government explaining some of the diplomats of
*15:21.340- 15:26.420* :  Latin America because they also their government's also requested this if we are going to see it or not
*15:27.080- 15:33.240* :  it depends on the government of Nicolas Maduro but for now they seem they're taking their time to
*15:33.240- 15:38.700* :  show them and it's been not only a request of the opposition of regional governments but also
*15:38.700- 15:45.320* :  of some international observers like the Carter Center the American Carter Center's an institution
*15:45.340- 15:50.080* :  that has been observed in elections in Venezuela since Hugo Chavez times.
*15:51.020- 15:55.680* :  Jorge Perez from BBC Mundo and if you'd like to hear more about Nicolas Maduro and Venezuela's
*15:55.680- 16:01.600* :  disputed election you'll find it on the latest episode of the BBC's global story podcast just
*16:01.600- 16:08.260* :  search for the global story wherever you get your BBC podcasts. Photos of North Korea's leader
*16:08.260- 16:13.460* :  Kim Jong Un tend to portray him as powerful inspecting military equipment or riding on horseback.
*16:13.920- 16:18.440* :  Reports from South Korea suggest he may be more in firm than he likes to admit though
*16:18.840- 16:23.500* :  and that North Korean officials are trying to obtain medicine to deal with his obesity-related
*16:23.500- 16:30.580* :  health problems. Gene McKenzie is our correspondent in Seoul. This has come from an intelligence briefing
*16:30.580- 16:35.620* :  here in South Korea and these happen quite regularly so every month also people from the intelligent
*16:35.620- 16:41.940* :  services brief this committee of MPs here about their sort of latest findings on North Korea
*16:42.380- 16:48.540* :  and then those MPs brief the media so we always get this information a bit second hand
*16:48.540- 16:53.720* :  but what has come out of the latest briefing are these lines about Kim Jong Un's health so
*16:53.720- 16:59.200* :  primarily the intel services and these MPs saying that they now think that Kim Jong Un weighs 140
*16:59.200- 17:05.500* :  kilograms and so that puts him at risk they are saying of a whole load of health-related obesity
*17:05.500- 17:11.680* :  related diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure and heart disease. This is a man who
*17:11.680- 17:16.200* :  smokes heavily who drinks heavily who obviously eats a lot which is one of the things that I think
*17:16.200- 17:20.220* :  has always been hard for people of North Korea to stomach because of course North Korea is a
*17:20.220- 17:25.760* :  country where there are extreme food shortages. A large proportion of the country are malnourished
*17:26.080- 17:30.720* :  without our access to food and then you have this leadership that clearly has a lot of access
*17:30.720- 17:35.780* :  to food and the finer things in life. We did see him lose weight some time ago he really slimmed
*17:35.780- 17:41.060* :  down but that weight all went back on pretty quickly and so you have the intelligence services now
*17:41.060- 17:46.120* :  as I said but for some time now they have been warning about his health because what they are
*17:46.120- 17:51.880* :  always thinking ahead to is like well if he is to die prematurely who then comes in to succeed him
*17:51.880- 17:57.960* :  how does the regime stabilize itself and does that mean the regime is more likely to collapse because
*17:57.960- 18:03.040* :  perhaps there isn't a kind of natural succession plan in place. Jim McKenzie in Seoul
*18:05.360- 18:10.900* :  still to come on this podcast. We heard a lot of firing and we were on the ground for maybe about
*18:10.900- 18:15.280* :  a minute and still hear a lot of firing going I thought holy cow this is really a hot zone.
*18:15.760- 18:20.500* :  One of the most controversial people to have shaped American views of the Vietnam war has died.
*18:29.860- 18:36.440* :  It's that time of the year your vacation is coming up you can already hear the beach waves
*18:36.440- 18:45.420* :  feel the warm breeze relax and think about work you really really want it all to work out while

*18:50.480- 18:56.360* :  and everyone's in sync things just flow wherever you are tap the banner to go to Monday.com.
*18:59.880- 19:04.500* :  Hey I'm Ryan Reynolds recently I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are
*19:04.500- 19:09.400* :  allowed to raise prices due to inflation they said yes and then when I asked if raising prices
*19:09.400- 19:14.440* :  technically violates those owners to your contracts they said what the **** are you talking about
*19:14.440- 19:19.860* :  you insane Hollywood ass **** so to recap we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month
*19:19.860- 19:25.560* :  to just $15 a month give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch. $45 up front for three months plus

*19:37.340- 19:42.280* :  critically ill Palestinians are on their way from Gaza to the United Arab Emirates for treatment.
*19:42.280- 19:47.280* :  It's the largest single medical evacuation since the brutal Hamas attack on southern Israel
*19:47.280- 19:54.040* :  on October the 7th including some 150 patients. Israel's sweeping military operations against
*19:54.040- 19:59.580* :  Hamas have decimated Gaza's health care system since then international journalists aren't allowed
*19:59.580- 20:04.380* :  into Gaza but Barbara Petash's report uses footage sent in by a local cameraman.
*20:09.140- 20:13.580* :  This bus station in central Gaza is crowded with people embarking on a rare journey.
*20:14.400- 20:16.800* :  One boy is being carried to his seat on a stretcher.
*20:18.920- 20:21.500* :  Officials are calling up the names of those on their list.
*20:23.040- 20:27.500* :  It's a chance for the sick and injured to get the care they can't get here they hope.
*20:28.320- 20:29.580* :  Nothing is ever certain.
*20:33.640- 20:38.580* :  Chaza Abu Salim is pushing her daughter Lamise in a wheelchair. The young girl needs major
*20:38.580- 20:45.340* :  surgery for scoliosis delayed now by six months. She barely moves her face stained with tears
*20:45.340- 20:53.040* :  and exhaustion. I call on the whole world to look at us with compassion. I could not believe it when
*20:53.040- 20:58.360* :  they contacted me that my daughter was amongst those on the list going outside Gaza for treatment.
*20:59.260- 21:03.960* :  I do not know when the war will end. I do not know when my daughter can receive treatment.
*21:04.820- 21:07.420* :  May God make it easy and heal everyone.
*21:09.040- 21:14.080* :  So many need to be healed but Israel's war against Hamas has closed hospitals,
*21:14.560- 21:19.000* :  killed doctors, blocked medicines, inflicted traumatic injuries.
*21:21.260- 21:25.920* :  We were struck. My eldest son was killed. My father was killed.
*21:26.540- 21:28.860* :  My youngest son Assa lost his sight.
*21:28.860- 21:35.240* :  Nassima El Agile is holding little asser. His eyelid closed over an empty socket. Her leg
*21:35.240- 21:40.760* :  wrapped in bandages. His left eye was blown out with a skull fracture.
*21:40.940- 21:44.940* :  My middle son suffers from a leg injury and leg deformities.
*21:45.480- 21:51.100* :  And I suffer a skull fracture. Blindness in my left eye and a broken shoulder and ribs.
*21:54.840- 22:00.180* :  There's no safe place in Gaza. The front line keeps closing in. Again, this week,
*22:00.180- 22:05.740* :  scenes of people forced to flee and Israeli military operation. Many have had to do so time
*22:05.800- 22:08.940* :  and time again. They have nowhere left to go.
*22:15.180- 22:19.440* :  The buses are pretty much the only way out. It's not the first medical evacuation,
*22:19.440- 22:24.900* :  but it is the biggest, facilitated by the World Health Organization in coordination with the
*22:24.900- 22:30.820* :  Israelis. WHO says there are still 10,000 more patients that need to leave Gaza.
*22:43.180- 22:48.320* :  She's standing with crutches, wiping away tears. But her eyes light up when she talks about
*22:48.320- 22:54.380* :  walking again. I'm very happy because I would travel. They will give me an artificial limb
*22:54.500- 22:58.900* :  and I'll be able to walk again. I wish that the war would end and that all children like me
*22:58.900- 23:03.640* :  will be able to come with me and have artificial limbs fitted and receive treatment abroad.
*23:03.960- 23:06.680* :  I also hope that I will return to see my father in peace.
*23:07.760- 23:10.680* :  It is a bittersweet goodbye in the middle of a war.
*23:11.860- 23:14.780* :  Selma Abid needs care for a tumor in her ovaries.
*23:15.420- 23:19.680* :  She prepares to wrench herself away from the young daughter clinging to her neck.
*23:21.720- 23:26.240* :  How can I leave this little girl behind she asks? Since the first day of the war she has been
*23:26.240- 23:33.080* :  afraid, she cannot sleep at all. It's a collective trauma that Selma, like many others, will carry with her.
*23:34.900- 23:39.340* :  The doors of the bus are closing. This is only the first leg of a long journey.
*23:39.720- 23:45.200* :  Little children stand waving in the windows. Those on board are hoping for a cure.
*23:45.740- 23:50.700* :  Hoping even more, they will see their families again. At one day, they'll be able to return.
*23:53.200- 23:58.240* :  I'm at least correspondent Barbara Plattarsha. One of the most controversial individuals to have
*23:58.240- 24:03.480* :  left his mark on American views of the Vietnam War has died. Lieutenant William Calli commanded
*24:03.480- 24:08.700* :  the US Army platoon that carried out one of the worst war crimes in American military history.
*24:09.280- 24:14.300* :  Eventually, in 2009, 41 years after the events, he said he was sorry.
*24:14.920- 24:18.680* :  Mark Duff looks back at the man and the massacre that won him notoriety.
*24:19.460- 24:24.400* :  And so the helicopters put down and we jumped out and still hear a lot of firing going.
*24:24.400- 24:29.440* :  I thought, holy cow, this is really a hot zone. But a couple of minutes later, we realized we
*24:29.440- 24:33.600* :  were not being fired in. Ron Hebbley was a battle-hardened frontline war photographer
*24:34.200- 24:39.640* :  when he landed with American troops outside the Hamlet of Me Lai in March 1968.
*24:40.580- 24:45.240* :  Even he was shot by what he saw that day. We're just pretty carnage in the village.
*24:45.240- 24:50.280* :  It's just unreal scenes happening. I mean, the hooters were burning. There was people,
*24:50.340- 24:54.800* :  dead people laying in some of the hooters. There was people, you know, on the trail.
*24:55.740- 24:59.840* :  I think the weirdest thing was some of the soldiers were jumping on some of the animals,
*24:59.840- 25:04.460* :  the waterbuffles with their bayonets trying to stab them. And just a complete, you know,
*25:04.460- 25:09.140* :  freak out scene. But still, to this day, I still can't really figure it out.
*25:09.380- 25:16.000* :  Soldiers under the command of Lieutenant William Cali killed 504 people as they conducted a search
*25:16.000- 25:22.420* :  and destroy operation against Viet Cong communist guerrillas. Nearly all of the victims were civilians.
*25:22.460- 25:28.980* :  The killing's shot at the United States already divided by the war and galvanized the growing
*25:28.980- 25:36.180* :  anti-war movement. Cali was charged with killing 102 men, women and children. He was eventually
*25:36.180- 25:43.520* :  convicted of 22 deaths. At his court, Marshall, he made this defense of his actions.
*26:01.840- 26:05.760* :  When my troops were getting mastered and mauled by an enemy I couldn't see, I couldn't feel and I
*26:05.760- 26:13.700* :  couldn't touch. That nobody in the military system ever described as anything other in communism.
*26:14.900- 26:18.200* :  They didn't give it a race. They didn't give it a sex. They didn't give it an age.
*26:19.760- 26:23.060* :  They never let me believe it was just a philosophy in a man's mind.
*26:25.140- 26:26.300* :  And that was my enemy out there.
*26:26.960- 26:33.360* :  For his crimes, he spent just three days behind bars before he was released under house arrest
*26:33.920- 26:39.320* :  by President Richard Nixon. Cali always protested that he'd been made a scapegoat.
*26:39.920- 26:45.580* :  For all that, he became a living symbol of the moral corruption that the war in Vietnam
*26:47.020- 26:48.400* :  on America's self-image.
*27:16.920- 27:19.720* :  University College London, she spoke to my colleague Justin Webb.
*27:45.580- 27:50.360* :  It's not just to communicate with other people, it's to see other things that might be interesting
*27:50.360- 27:55.120* :  to us because companies make money that way. People want you to keep going back to their social media
*27:55.120- 27:58.620* :  because that's where they can put adverts and that's how they can sell space. They want to keep
*27:58.620- 28:03.060* :  you looking. The place thing is interesting. How does that then change us on our interactions?
*28:03.100- 28:08.380* :  Because you're no longer in one place talking to someone you know is in another place because
*28:08.380- 28:11.940* :  there could be anywhere. I think it's still the personal aspect that matters most.
*28:12.140- 28:16.640* :  So the thing that's very interesting about humans is we are the born communicators.
*28:16.820- 28:20.200* :  So from the minute you're born, you will pay attention to other human beings and they will behave
*28:20.220- 28:24.800* :  as if you're in a conversation with you. And that's how you learn to speak is in conversations.
*28:24.960- 28:28.840* :  In conversations, it's very important throughout your whole life, some of the worst things that
*28:28.840- 28:33.240* :  can happen to a human is you take them out of conversation or social spaces so that's loneliness
*28:33.240- 28:37.220* :  and it's very bad for our health. And if you look at the development of technology,
*28:37.900- 28:41.760* :  almost as soon as a piece of technology appears we will find a way of using it for communication.
*28:41.760- 28:46.460* :  So humans discover writing, we start writing letters. If I go back a couple of generations
*28:46.460- 28:52.780* :  like my grandparents before they had phones, they would write postcards to each other back and
*28:52.780- 28:56.660* :  forth in a day because there were several postings there you would have in the moment correspondence
*28:56.660- 29:01.560* :  bit like we might use email now. And that's immediately shifted as soon as phones come along.
*29:01.560- 29:05.620* :  We're just not using it to tell people to order things. We're using it to call our friends.
*29:05.620- 29:10.000* :  Which does what to our brains? Well, probably none of that changes the brains
*29:10.000- 29:13.420* :  fundamentally in that what the important thing is that you're communicating and our brains are
*29:13.420- 29:17.700* :  so flexible and plastic that we will find new ways of using that communication. So when mobile
*29:17.700- 29:21.640* :  phones came along, everyone thought we'll be using it like a home phone and we'll be talking
*29:21.640- 29:26.920* :  to everybody but almost immediately text messaging became if anything more important. And you see
*29:26.920- 29:30.400* :  that kind of explode in the world of different ways that you can communicate digitally.
*29:31.120- 29:36.520* :  Really interestingly, if you look at young people who are much more fluent users of this kind of
*29:36.520- 29:41.900* :  digital text communication than an old person like me, they still, if you compare them having a
*29:41.900- 29:45.920* :  conversation with a friend, having a conversation on a phone with that friend or texting that friend,
*29:46.720- 29:50.840* :  they still feel better and more connected when they've had the face-to-face conversation with
*29:50.840- 29:56.180* :  the friends. So they're still at the heart of it. What you really want is that sort of in-person
*29:56.180- 30:00.800* :  communication and phones will give you that almost as good as face-to-face but not quite.
*30:01.400- 30:07.900* :  Professor Sophie Scott of University College London. Wife carrying in Finland, Haggis Hurling in
*30:07.900- 30:14.180* :  Scotland, a mud Olympics in Germany, just some of the bizarre contests that have made a shortlist
*30:14.180- 30:20.480* :  for fans favorite alternative sports after 2,000 people were questioned by the airline EasyJet.
*30:20.900- 30:25.700* :  David Lewis has been looking through what made the cut. Every four years, the eyes of the world
*30:25.700- 30:30.560* :  are turned to the greatest sporting event on earth. But as top athletes descend on Paris
*30:30.560- 30:34.980* :  for the Olympics, other eye-catching events around the continent are getting a look in.
*30:35.240- 30:40.400* :  A handful have now been named as Europe's most interesting alternative sports. Hundreds of
*30:40.400- 30:45.640* :  fans were asked and they found their favourite in Finland, the Wife carrying championship in
*30:45.640- 30:51.400* :  Sonkejavi. For the uninitiated, the clue is very much in the name. Male competitors aim to
*30:51.400- 30:56.740* :  carry their female partner through an obstacle course in the quickest time possible, ideally without
*30:56.740- 31:02.400* :  hurting themselves or their marriage. Strategies differ, either a piggyback, a fireman's lift,
*31:02.400- 31:08.100* :  or why not go rogue doing it Estonian style, with the lady perched upside down with legs
*31:08.100- 31:13.180* :  clinging like a crab around her spouse's neck. A pair from Australia won this year's sprint,
*31:13.180- 31:18.300* :  they were smiling in their winners photo, though she was still wearing her helmet. If that's not
*31:18.300- 31:23.160* :  quite physically destabilising enough, there's always a French wine marathon. The marathon
*31:23.160- 31:31.060* :  due Medoc is a full 42-kilometer race, and one for the Bombavers. With 23 wine stops thrown in,
*31:31.060- 31:37.280* :  the cause runs through vineyards and countryside. Oh, and participants are encouraged to snack
*31:37.280- 31:44.040* :  on route on Oyster's Fouagrat Cheese Steak and Ice Cream. Yes, that's Oyster's Fouagrat Cheese Steak
*31:44.460- 31:50.120* :  Over the border in Germany, why not try your hand at the mud Olympics? The sporting events
*31:50.120- 31:55.140* :  held on the mud flats along the banks of the Elbe River near Hamburg include wrestling and
*31:55.140- 32:00.200* :  handball, all in the muck. Plus, participants can try their luck at the mud eel race,
*32:00.200- 32:06.320* :  slithering like a fish in the brown stuff to glory. But for athletes who seek to stand still,
*32:06.320- 32:10.860* :  there's always haggess hurling. Held in the birthplace of poet Robbie Burns,
*32:10.860- 32:16.560* :  the traditional Scottish supper, sheep's stomach stuffed with the animals heart liver and lungs,
*32:16.560- 32:23.100* :  is thrown as far as possible. The world record is an impressive 66 metres, and there's an option
*32:23.100- 32:27.160* :  to keep the missile as a souvenir. David Lewis reporting.
*32:28.960- 32:32.680* :  And that's all from us for now. We'll be in new edition of Global News to download later.

*32:50.720- 32:53.180* :  Thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye.
*33:04.140- 33:08.780* :  Hi, I'm Simon Jack. And I'm Zingseng. And good bad billionaire is back for a new season,
*33:08.780- 33:13.920* :  now from the BBC World Service. Every episode we pick a billionaire and we find out how they made
*33:13.920- 33:18.480* :  their money. And then we judge them, are they good, bad, or just another billionaire.
*33:18.820- 33:21.920* :  So who are some of the people that you'll hear about in season two?
*33:22.080- 33:27.040* :  The richest comedian ever? Jerry Seinfeld's there. There's also my personal favorite story,
*33:27.040- 33:32.880* :  the fashion designer who was once a communist mind, that's Mutu Prada. And the people behind some
*33:32.880- 33:37.580* :  of the biggest companies on the planet. Google TikTok for example. But we are kicking off with a
*33:37.580- 33:43.440* :  sporting superstar, Tiger Woods. Good bad billionaire from the BBC World Service. Listen now
