*01:23.540- 01:28.840* :  I'm Andrew Pageant at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 19th of July. These are our main stories.
*01:28.860- 01:34.980* :  A software update by a cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike has caused major computer problems worldwide.
*01:35.100- 01:40.000* :  Hundreds of flights have been cancelled, banks, broadcasters and hospitals are among the others
*01:40.000- 01:45.000* :  affected. A court in Russia has found the American journalist Evan Gershkiewicz guilty of
*01:45.000- 01:53.120* :  espionage and sentenced him to 16 years in prison. Also in this podcast, Donald Trump described
*01:53.120- 01:58.580* :  Saturday's assassination attempt to Republicans in Milwaukee. I'm not supposed to be here tonight.
*02:02.620- 02:07.900* :  I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God.
*02:09.820- 02:13.220* :  And the most powerful man in Vietnam has died at the age of 80.
*02:16.920- 02:20.880* :  Let's start the podcast with the software defect, which has caused computer chaos around
*02:20.880- 02:24.660* :  the world. It sounds like a small thing, but it's brought flights to a standstill,
*02:24.660- 02:29.760* :  stopped stock exchanges from trading and disrupted everything from hospitals to supermarkets.
*02:29.760- 02:36.540* :  The fault is due to a cyber security company CrowdStrike. It's chief executive George Kurtz told NBC News.
*02:36.920- 02:41.520* :  They know what the issue is. They fixed it, but it could take some time for systems to recover.
*02:41.520- 02:46.380* :  He said they were deeply sorry for the impact on customers. I've been talking to our business
*02:46.380- 02:52.800* :  correspondent in Singapore, Nick Marsh. George Kurtz at CrowdStrike is going to be a very relieved man
*02:52.800- 02:58.440* :  now that they've finally found that problem and they've deployed that fix, but that's only the
*02:58.440- 03:05.060* :  start of it. Identifying it is one thing, but actually making sure that each individual end point
*03:05.060- 03:11.080* :  is the jargon computer basically is effectively rebooted, turned off and turned on again.
*03:11.420- 03:16.580* :  So they can actually, as it were, absorb that update to the defective software. That is going to
*03:16.580- 03:21.820* :  take a lot of time. The jargon is hands-on keyboards. So if you're a small business,
*03:21.820- 03:27.560* :  maybe you can sort that up pretty quickly, but given the fact that CrowdStrike have 24,000
*03:27.560- 03:33.700* :  customers and customers means an organization. So multiply that by how many computers they have.
*03:33.700- 03:40.200* :  We're talking a very, very long reboot process before the world starts getting back to normal.
*03:40.460- 03:44.900* :  And we're seeing some firm has managed to do this really quickly. American Airlines is an obvious
*03:44.900- 03:50.200* :  example of a company that was badly affected, had to ground all its flights and then told us
*03:50.400- 03:55.740* :  things are back to normal. Is that just because of the quality of IT support that a huge corporation
*03:55.780- 03:59.840* :  like that is going to have compared to the rest of us? Yeah, it's hard to say with certainty,
*04:00.420- 04:04.760* :  but a big organization on the one hand, yes, they do have a lot of terminals and they have
*04:05.040- 04:10.780* :  a lot more rebooting to do, but they are going to have a good level of IT support, dedicated in-house
*04:10.780- 04:15.640* :  support, smaller businesses, smaller organizations, the probably outsource their IT support,
*04:15.640- 04:20.600* :  and they're going to be pretty overwhelmed. These IT services now aren't they? I do think,
*04:20.600- 04:26.620* :  though, it is slightly part of the uncertainty and the mystery as to why certain systems were hit
*04:27.060- 04:31.520* :  and why others weren't, why others managed to get theirs up so quickly and others weren't.
*04:31.520- 04:36.160* :  That's probably all going to be part of the post-mortem once this is completely finished.
*04:36.440- 04:40.480* :  And in terms of assessing the disruption, we know that there's chaos at airports all over the
*04:40.500- 04:44.940* :  place. Some airlines have still got their planes on the ground. That's one of the most obvious
*04:44.940- 04:50.840* :  examples of this kind of thing, but it's playing out in hospitals, supermarkets, cafes,
*04:50.840- 04:56.780* :  at ports, the list is endless of places that are affected by this. Yeah, it is. I mean, hospitals,
*04:56.780- 05:01.860* :  emergency services, they're naturally the most concerning sectors that have been hit,
*05:01.860- 05:07.020* :  because we are talking about matters of life and death ultimately there. We don't seem to have
*05:07.020- 05:12.940* :  heard any really, really serious cases of disruption when it comes to that, but even something
*05:13.280- 05:17.740* :  as mundane as an advertising screen and a shopping centre will have that blue screen.
*05:18.280- 05:25.460* :  So we're talking everything in our society that uses windows and that uses this crowd strike
*05:25.460- 05:31.820* :  Falcon server updates, which is their designs to stop cyber attacks. It has actually ended up
*05:31.820- 05:36.760* :  causing a huge problem. All of that has been affected. And just one thing that's interesting,
*05:36.760- 05:41.300* :  though, Andrew, I've just been looking on Chinese social media and reports of what's happening
*05:41.300- 05:47.800* :  there. China seems to be largely unaffected and the reason is that China has made a really big push
*05:47.800- 05:54.120* :  to become what they call self-sufficient. So not use foreign software, like Microsoft,
*05:54.140- 05:59.780* :  and they have basically escaped pretty much unscathed. Nick Marsh, with me from Singapore,
*05:59.780- 06:04.080* :  let's hear from some of our correspondents around the world about how different regions have been
*06:04.080- 06:09.960* :  affected, starting with Shima Halil, who's in Japan. I am in Shibuya in the heart of Tokyo. Famous
*06:09.960- 06:15.020* :  of ports for its neon lights, it's many, many signs all around and it's huge screens. And I'm
*06:15.020- 06:19.500* :  looking at one right now, Andrew, and it seems to be working fine. No blue screens of death
*06:19.920- 06:25.500* :  around me. The effect seems to be localized to certain parts of the country,
*06:25.500- 06:30.820* :  namely in Narita Airport, one of the country's biggest airports. And specifically,
*06:30.820- 06:36.220* :  Jetstar, Japan, this budget airline, they have had to cancel dozens of their domestic flights,
*06:36.220- 06:40.440* :  because of a system malfunction, having to do with checking people in. So we've been seeing
*06:40.440- 06:44.460* :  pictures of people being checked in manually. And of course, the knock-on effect of that,
*06:44.660- 06:49.180* :  the delays, the cancellations. One thing to say, of course, this is the height of the tourism
*06:49.180- 06:55.240* :  season here in Japan. But also, its school holidays, you know, kids are out and many, many families
*06:55.240- 07:02.120* :  have been planning their travels. Japan Airlines have also reported a glitch in the reservation
*07:02.120- 07:07.080* :  management that has to do with their with their apps. So if you were changing or if you're making
*07:07.080- 07:12.540* :  your reservation on an app, that has been stopped as well. Train lines, we're keeping an eye on,
*07:12.540- 07:16.620* :  because of course, there are the main archery of transportation here, especially the Shinkansen,
*07:17.440- 07:21.860* :  the bullet train. That hasn't been affected as of yet, but we're keeping an eye on that. We did
*07:21.860- 07:28.680* :  hear from JR West and Osaka a train line that has been affected in terms of screens of where people
*07:28.680- 07:33.960* :  should go to catch their trains. The trains themselves are working. One last thing that we've heard
*07:33.960- 07:39.880* :  has been affected was this big tourist destination in Osaka, Universal Studios, Japan, a huge park.
*07:39.880- 07:46.800* :  They have been reporting glitches in their cashiers and registers. So their shops and restaurants
*07:46.800- 07:52.000* :  have been affected. But we've also heard that some of their ACs, their air conditioner systems
*07:52.000- 07:57.920* :  have been affected. And it is boiling hot here. And so people have been giving water just to
*07:57.920- 08:04.480* :  manage the heat. Generally, I feel like looking around me, there's so many tourists, so many people
*08:04.480- 08:10.320* :  walking around. It feels like it's business as usual here, but there have been specific areas
*08:10.320- 08:16.020* :  that have been affected, affecting hundreds and hundreds of people. And from Shima Helio in Tokyo,
*08:16.020- 08:21.260* :  to Samira Hussein, who's been at Delhi Airport in the Indian capital, she says they've gone manual
*08:21.260- 08:26.480* :  with flight information written up in green pen on a whiteboard. We were in this very long
*08:26.480- 08:33.380* :  queue. Lots of chaos. People are just trying to get information. Then we were handed blank
*08:33.380- 08:40.400* :  boarding cards. And we were meant to fill out our information onto these boarding cards. So
*08:40.700- 08:45.840* :  you would write your name or if you were already assigned a seat number, you meant to write down
*08:45.840- 08:51.020* :  your seat number because you couldn't even print boarding passes, even if you had them. And they
*08:51.020- 08:56.020* :  weren't accepting anything on phones because nothing could be scanned. And so you wrote down all of
*08:56.020- 09:04.580* :  your information manually. Once you finally get to an agent, they then assign you sort of a zone
*09:04.580- 09:10.660* :  kind of in which that you're going to be able to force. And then they give you your baggage tags.
*09:10.900- 09:17.240* :  And those are also blank. And so you're manually entering your baggage tags and then sticking it
*09:17.280- 09:23.440* :  onto your suitcases. So it's anyone's guess whether or not I'm going to come to my final destination
*09:23.440- 09:29.780* :  with any of our things. So I spoke with another pilot who is flying to another city. And I asked,
*09:29.820- 09:36.000* :  you know, well, I mean, this is just a remarkable situation, you know, what do you think? And her
*09:36.000- 09:42.180* :  answer was remarkable in that she said, well, look, you know, what are we going to do? I mean,
*09:42.180- 09:47.400* :  we can't use the machine. So we're going to have to enter everything manually. Yes, it's going to
*09:47.400- 09:53.160* :  be a lot slower, but things are still happening. Of course, I asked quite selfishly whether it's
*09:53.160- 09:59.500* :  still safe to fly to which you said, of course, you know, the flights of the flight systems here
*09:59.500- 10:05.100* :  have nothing to do with the outages. That shouldn't be an issue. She said, really, it has to do with
*10:05.420- 10:11.140* :  passenger information, registering that people are getting onto the right planes. And that they
*10:11.140- 10:15.780* :  have the correct boarding passes and all that information. And from Samira, saying in Delhi,
*10:15.780- 10:21.100* :  to Damien McGinnis in Berlin, when we arrived here a few hours ago, the queues were huge,
*10:21.100- 10:26.500* :  the whole main terminal was absolutely round with people trying to figure out what to do,
*10:26.500- 10:30.400* :  looking at the boards, realizing their flights were cancelled, and then trying to figure out an
*10:30.400- 10:35.440* :  alternative route. That situation slightly eased off now. So when we arrived, I would say most of
*10:35.440- 10:40.180* :  the flights were cancelled, now only a couple of the flights were cancelled. So the situation's
*10:40.180- 10:44.900* :  definitely got better, but there are a lot of people here who have been here for six or seven hours
*10:44.900- 10:48.980* :  trying to figure out what flight they can get. And that's really the problem because I think what
*10:48.980- 10:52.620* :  we're going to see now, all this morning the flights were disrupted, all cancelled.
*10:53.180- 10:57.380* :  And of course, that takes a lot of catching up to do. Plains might be in the wrong place, crews
*10:57.380- 11:02.460* :  might be in the wrong place, and also people need to find replacement flights. Some people are
*11:02.460- 11:08.420* :  connecting to Frankfurt to go on to Asia or to the States. So these are quite complicated
*11:08.420- 11:12.840* :  travel arrangements sometimes. And I think what I can see here, the scene is everyone is on a phone,
*11:12.840- 11:17.820* :  looking anxious, looking at apps, trying to get through to call centres, trying to organise
*11:17.820- 11:23.060* :  how to move forward now. So it's a shame for people because this is for a lot of people
*11:23.060- 11:28.060* :  that they're once in a year holiday, the summer holiday has just begun, and so people definitely
*11:28.060- 11:32.040* :  look disappointed here. No one wants it to be disrupted and also makes it a very, very busy
*11:32.040- 11:35.700* :  travelling day in many countries today. What about health care? Because I know health care has been
*11:35.700- 11:40.680* :  affected in Germany as well. Yeah, there have been a few problems. I think we haven't seen it
*11:40.680- 11:46.940* :  as it hasn't been as bad as in other countries, but certainly in Northern Germany, there have been
*11:46.940- 11:54.120* :  a few hospitals that have cancelled pre-planned procedures. Emergency care is still going on as
*11:54.120- 11:58.360* :  normal, but certainly some hospitals have reported that they're going to have to reschedule things.
*11:58.980- 12:03.660* :  And I think what we've seen here generally, the main issue for Germany has been flights,
*12:03.660- 12:09.180* :  and I think that situation will resolve over the next day or two. The other situations with
*12:09.180- 12:14.340* :  with other services hasn't been as bad really as say in Britain or Australia for certain.
*12:14.820- 12:19.140* :  Damien McGinnis with the story from Germany. Damien mentioned Australia, these passengers
*12:19.140- 12:25.080* :  at Sydney Airport described the chaos there. It was so busy, we didn't know what was happening,
*12:25.780- 12:32.420* :  so now we are trying to book another ticket for tonight, but they're $600. So I give up.
*12:32.660- 12:40.020* :  It was very chaotic, so we arrived here, they had no idea what's going on. I mean this is the first time
*12:40.740- 12:45.980* :  I experience something like this. Our flights are in cancelled, so now we're trying to find
*12:45.980- 12:51.620* :  accommodation in Sydney, which is not easy, then we'll have to try and get a flight home somewhere,
*12:51.620- 12:57.520* :  somewhere, sometime, don't know. A correspondent Simon Atkinson was on a flight from Sydney to Brisbane
*12:57.520- 13:02.680* :  and spoke to us when he arrived. Here in Brisbane, things seem to be getting back to normal,
*13:02.680- 13:07.180* :  and I look up at the departure boards. Most flights have got some delays, there's only one cancellation,
*13:07.240- 13:12.080* :  some passengers are looking at three or four hour delays for their flights, but there is a sense
*13:12.080- 13:16.840* :  that things are getting back to normal. The local airline Jetstar seems to be the one which is
*13:16.960- 13:21.460* :  struggling the most. It was when I was in Sydney just a few hours ago that I first became aware of
*13:21.460- 13:25.540* :  this situation, was an announcement from Jetstar when they were telling their passengers they would
*13:25.540- 13:28.840* :  be unable to check them in, they wouldn't be able to board any of their passengers onto planes.
*13:29.300- 13:33.320* :  Well, planes did get up in the air fairly quickly, I'm proof of that. I've traveled here from
*13:33.800- 13:39.700* :  Sydney this evening, but the sense here is that things are certainly a little bit delayed,
*13:39.700- 13:43.920* :  and we've had soup markets where people haven't been able to use cards for payments,
*13:43.920- 13:48.040* :  have had reports of people abandoning their shopping because they couldn't buy it, they didn't
*13:48.060- 13:53.980* :  carry cash. It's kind of minor in conveniences on the whole. We had similar situations,
*13:55.020- 13:59.040* :  screens going blank in Sydney airport, all the information screens went down, which is one of the
*13:59.040- 14:03.140* :  main causes of confusion really. We haven't got that situation in Brisbane, everything
*14:03.380- 14:07.600* :  seems to be looking okay. So look, it does seem that things are getting, you know,
*14:07.600- 14:12.540* :  back to Normans I said, but certainly Australia is one of the first countries along with New Zealand
*14:12.540- 14:17.380* :  to really pick up on this because everyone of course was awake and seeing their daily routines
*14:17.380- 14:23.200* :  disrupted. Simon Atkinson in Australia, all the latest for you at BBC.com slash news.
*14:25.140- 14:31.760* :  Still to come in this podcast? In Shenhai, school students are being influenced by their
*14:31.760- 14:38.180* :  parents and drinking coffee. Some granny send their kids to school and then also pub in for coffee.
*14:38.760- 14:43.200* :  The Chinese city of Shenhai could become a new contender as the cafe capital of the world,
*14:43.560- 14:45.520* :  as people there develop a taste for coffee.

*15:28.160- 15:33.100* :  Russian quarters found the US journalist Evan Gershkovich guilty of spying and sentenced him to
*15:33.100- 15:38.760* :  16 years in a high security penal colony. Mr. Gershkovich, he works for the Wall Street Journal,
*15:38.760- 15:43.840* :  had pleaded not guilty. His employer and the White House have described the closed door trial in
*15:43.840- 15:48.700* :  the city of Yekaterinburg as a sham. Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg was in the courtroom.
*15:49.300- 15:53.780* :  Evan Gershkovich's trial had been held behind closed doors, but journalists were allowed
*15:53.780- 15:57.840* :  into the courtroom for the verdict. The Wall Street Journal reporter was standing in a glass
*15:57.840- 16:03.360* :  and metal cage, what passes as the dock in a Russian courtroom. The judge entered and
*16:03.360- 16:08.960* :  pronounced the US journalist guilty of espionage. He sentenced him to 16 years in a high security
*16:08.960- 16:15.160* :  penal colony. Evan Gershkovich's supporters, his employer and US officials, have dismissed the
*16:15.160- 16:20.720* :  trial as a sham. The Wall Street Journal has accused Moscow of stoppiling American citizens in
*16:20.720- 16:26.220* :  Russian jails to trade them for Russians, jailed abroad. The Israeli military has identified
*16:26.220- 16:30.580* :  Yemen as the most likely source of a deadly drone attack on the city of Tel Aviv.
*16:31.020- 16:36.180* :  One person died several more were injured. On social media, Yemen's Houthi militants suggested
*16:36.180- 16:41.460* :  they were responsible. Here's Rescue Service Paramedic Rowie Klein giving a statement to reporters.
*16:42.040- 16:49.640* :  When we arrived at the scene, we found four patients suffering from penetrating trauma and
*16:49.640- 16:59.180* :  blunt force trauma. All of them were having mild injuries. Afterwards, we found a 50-year-old male
*16:59.500- 17:06.660* :  in one of the apartment nearby. We had to stop all the resuscitations and pronounce him dead.
*17:06.920- 17:11.620* :  Our reporter Barbara Platt Asher is in Jerusalem. I began by asking Barbara how this device had
*17:11.620- 17:16.620* :  got through. It was detected, according to the Israeli military. A military official said it had
*17:16.620- 17:21.600* :  been seen, but there had been a human error involved, so they didn't try to shoot it down.
*17:21.760- 17:27.340* :  Some reports suggest that when it was detected, it wasn't defined as a hostile projectile,
*17:27.340- 17:31.940* :  like a hostile drone, so maybe misidentified. That part isn't particularly clear,
*17:31.940- 17:37.040* :  but the military did say that they had seen it. They just hadn't tried to fire it down.
*17:37.040- 17:43.240* :  The Houthis in Yemen are saying it was them, their claiming responsibility. Can we verify that yet?
*17:43.700- 17:47.860* :  The claim from the Houthi militants or the military spokesman of the Houthi movement was quite
*17:47.860- 17:54.100* :  specific. He said that they had used a new drone, which they call Yaffa, which had a longer range
*17:54.100- 17:57.980* :  and could be fired without detection. This is why the question was raised with the Israeli
*17:57.980- 18:03.220* :  military, and that they were going to make Tel Aviv a primary target going forward.
*18:03.760- 18:07.780* :  It should be said that the Houthis have fired dozens of missiles and rockets at Israel
*18:08.400- 18:12.780* :  over the past months, I think since about November after the Hamas attack in Israel and then the
*18:12.780- 18:19.200* :  Israeli war in Gaza. But most of those missiles, in fact, almost all of them have been intercepted,
*18:19.200- 18:24.520* :  either by the Israelis or by the Americans. There was at least one that hit in an open area
*18:24.520- 18:29.280* :  near the southern port of Alat. But if this is a Houthi missile, it would be the first time to
*18:29.280- 18:32.220* :  hit in a residential area and in a city like Tel Aviv.
*18:32.440- 18:36.980* :  Barbara Platt Asher with me from Jerusalem. Donald Trump has told the Republican Convention,
*18:36.980- 18:42.980* :  he wants to heal discord in society and govern for all Americans if he wins the White House in November.
*18:43.680- 18:47.840* :  To loud cheers, he formally accepted the nomination as the party's presidential candidate.
*18:47.840- 18:52.680* :  It was Mr Trump's first speech since a government tried to assassinate him last weekend,
*18:52.680- 18:58.340* :  and he described that shooting in detail, suggesting he survived because he had God on his side.
*18:58.940- 19:01.220* :  And North America correspondent Nomiya Ikbal was there.
*19:02.080- 19:05.180* :  The Republican Party is very much the party is from.
*19:05.340- 19:10.600* :  I proudly accept your nomination for President of the United States.
*19:11.700- 19:13.800* :  Walking out on stage, Donald Trump, again,
*19:13.880- 19:18.760* :  exported that thick bandage on his right here, signifying how he cheated death.
*19:19.560- 19:25.160* :  He received this rapturous applause from the excitement on the faces of the audience,
*19:25.160- 19:31.300* :  the adulation. It really felt like being in one of those mega churches that you find in America.
*19:32.040- 19:35.360* :  With Mr Trump receiving treatment as they secure a Messiah.
*19:35.740- 19:39.200* :  I'm not supposed to be here tonight, not supposed to be here.
*19:43.300- 19:53.440* :  But I'm not, and I'll tell you, I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God.
*19:56.200- 20:00.120* :  The former president said he would only talk about his assassination attempt the once because
*20:00.120- 20:06.060* :  it was too painful. Following the events of Saturday, he had indicated he wanted to focus on unity
*20:06.060- 20:09.580* :  that he changed his speech because he wants to bring people together.
*20:10.040- 20:16.820* :  And he did do that, sort of. He soon fell into the usual themes of political persecution without
*20:16.820- 20:23.300* :  evidence. We are one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
*20:23.480- 20:28.820* :  And we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement.
*20:29.960- 20:35.220* :  In that spirit, the Democrat Party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and
*20:35.220- 20:44.360* :  labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy, especially since that is not true.
*20:44.360- 20:49.240* :  In fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country.
*20:50.540- 20:58.620* :  Only the Republican Party convention agenda has been about making America wealthy, safe, strong, and
*20:58.620- 21:04.200* :  great again. And Mr. Trump used those themes to talk about key policies such as installation,
*21:04.200- 21:08.920* :  illegal immigration, and he made bold promises regarding foreign policy.
*21:09.300- 21:15.020* :  I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created,
*21:16.040- 21:21.640* :  including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened if I was
*21:21.640- 21:29.120* :  President. And the war caused by the attack on Israel, which would have never happened if I
*21:29.120- 21:33.520* :  was President. Earlier in the evening, just before he gave his speech, he was sat in the family
*21:33.520- 21:39.640* :  and friend-boxed with his sons. And the wrestling legend Hulk Hogan fired up the crowd, ripping
*21:49.460- 21:52.980* :  off his shirt. And that combative message was echoed by Donald Trump and his supporters
*21:52.980- 21:58.760* :  constantly throughout the speech. They seem to have taken on a new slogan born out of that assassination
*21:58.800- 22:04.400* :  attempt. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were
*22:05.480- 22:10.620* :  breathlessly waiting and started shouting, fight, fight, fight.
*22:12.900- 22:15.440* :  For the Trump faithful, it was everything and more.
*22:15.740- 22:17.440* :  What did you think of Mr. Trump's speech?
*22:18.260- 22:24.040* :  Warm, handsome, personal, relational, powerful.
*22:25.220- 22:26.560* :  Everything you expected into me?
*22:27.280- 22:33.500* :  Yes, and more. His tone, his spirit is great.
*22:33.900- 22:37.800* :  You find a different side to him. Do you think there was a different tone?
*22:38.520- 22:45.580* :  100%. It was definitely a different side to him. I thought that it was, I think he's softer,
*22:45.580- 22:51.940* :  he's stronger, he's compassionate, he's driven. It was invigorating.
*22:52.600- 22:56.660* :  It's been nearly a decade of Donald Trump. Ever since he came down the elevator to announce
*22:56.660- 23:02.940* :  he was running to be President. And after he lost the election in 2021, the January 6 riots
*23:02.940- 23:08.500* :  happened. It seemed it was over for him with a Republican party trying to move away from him.
*23:09.140- 23:14.520* :  But with a criminal conviction, other indictments, including accusations of trying to overturn
*23:14.520- 23:20.120* :  democracy and an assassination attempt, he is now advanced, one of the most stunning political
*23:20.120- 23:22.380* :  comebacks in American political history.
*23:25.020- 23:29.480* :  And as Mr. Trump appears to gather momentum, the Democrat campaign remains in disarray.
*23:29.620- 23:34.700* :  Joe Biden is isolating at home in Delaware with COVID, with pressure from his closest
*23:34.700- 23:38.060* :  allies mounting for him to consider dropping out of the race altogether.
*23:38.060- 23:41.180* :  Here's our North America correspondent David Willis.
*23:41.560- 23:46.340* :  As Donald Trump was rounding off one of the most extraordinary weeks of his political career,
*23:46.340- 23:52.820* :  his rival was recuperating at his home in Delaware, isolated and still suffering from the
*23:52.820- 23:57.940* :  respiratory symptoms that prompted his abrupt departure from the campaign trail.
*23:57.980- 24:04.360* :  Joe Biden's political health is also in jeopardy, and it's been reported that senior members of
*24:04.360- 24:10.340* :  his party, among them the former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have met the President in recent days,
*24:10.340- 24:16.440* :  armed with polling data that suggests Donald Trump could be on track for a landslide victory
*24:16.440- 24:21.820* :  in November's election, with correspondingly dire implications for Democratic candidates
*24:21.820- 24:27.640* :  lower down the ticket. Yet the 81-year-old President has shown no sign of a willingness
*24:27.640- 24:31.940* :  to make way for someone younger. The most powerful man in Vietnam,
*24:31.940- 24:35.920* :  the head of the Communist Party in Gui and Futong, has died at the age of 80.
*24:36.460- 24:39.540* :  Besides overseeing the fast growth of the Vietnamese economy,
*24:39.900- 24:42.640* :  the 80-year-old was known for what he called his blazing
*24:42.640- 24:47.780* :  firmness's anti-corruption campaign. Asia-Pacific editor Michael Bristow told me more.
*24:48.460- 24:55.100* :  Only on Fou Trong, he'll be remembered primarily for perhaps breaking a system in Vietnam,
*24:55.100- 25:00.080* :  in which power was divided among the top leaders, traditionally in Vietnam, over the last few
*25:00.080- 25:05.920* :  years. It's been divided between four senior leaders. He, as managed to accrue a lot of power,
*25:05.920- 25:11.620* :  he did accrue a lot of power to himself as General Secretary of the Communist Party,
*25:11.620- 25:17.660* :  also for a time he was the President. And so that's perhaps one of his notable achievements,
*25:17.660- 25:23.660* :  perhaps you might call it. Also, he launched a campaign against corruption, lots of one-party
*25:23.660- 25:29.180* :  states, including Vietnam, have problems with corruption. He launched this blazing furnace,
*25:29.180- 25:33.920* :  he called it, corruption campaign in 2017. And that's netted a lot of businessmen,
*25:34.220- 25:38.400* :  even a lot of senior leaders in the Communist Party, a lot of cabinet ministers.
*25:39.880- 25:44.860* :  Perhaps though, he was quite a skillful politician and perhaps that show nowhere more than
*25:44.860- 25:51.920* :  in his foreign relations. He managed to walk a very delicate line between China and the United
*25:51.920- 25:58.420* :  States, for example, last year, President Biden visited Vietnam and a few months later he had
*25:58.420- 26:04.060* :  Xi Jinping from China. This year, you had President Putin from Russia, not many countries in the
*26:04.060- 26:08.940* :  world where you could say those three leaders would go within a year of each other and be welcomed.
*26:09.120- 26:13.440* :  We're talking yesterday about a new division of responsibilities of the Vietnamese government.
*26:13.600- 26:15.960* :  It was supposed to be a temporary thing. What happens next?
*26:16.980- 26:21.360* :  Yeah, what happens next? That's a good question. Well, what happened on Thursday was that the
*26:21.360- 26:27.560* :  President of Vietnam, a man called a tollum, he only took the position as president in May.
*26:28.160- 26:34.080* :  He assumed the caretaker responsibilities of Mr. Trong. Now he's going to obviously take over
*26:34.080- 26:40.360* :  those for some time. We're not quite sure if he'll be made President permanently. Mr.
*26:40.360- 26:48.440* :  Lung is a protégé of Mr. Trong, the General Secretary who's died. Perhaps the fear is amongst
*26:48.440- 26:54.640* :  lots of people inside Vietnam, people who criticize the government, the fear is that he will accrue
*26:54.640- 27:01.220* :  the power that Mr. Trong accrued himself to himself. So perhaps tollum will become the paramount
*27:01.220- 27:07.360* :  leader in Vietnam, but we're not sure yet if that's going to transpire because that's a little way
*27:07.360- 27:13.100* :  down the line. Michael Bristo with me, you may think of Rome or Paris when I asked about the
*27:13.100- 27:19.340* :  capital of the world, but China's financial capital is a new contender. At least that's what Shanghai's
*27:19.340- 27:23.840* :  local government is claiming, but the vast number of cafes is led to fierce competition
*27:23.840- 27:33.960* :  as Stephen McDonald reports. The coffee grinders are going into overdrive and the waters just keep
*27:33.960- 27:40.640* :  coming. In a country renowned for its tea, an explosion of new cafes is engulfed its financial
*27:40.640- 27:46.020* :  capital Shanghai. Kaffaiona Ujongen says that while the growth has been
*27:46.020- 27:50.920* :  bright neck of light, an appreciation of coffee has been building here for years,
*27:51.460- 27:55.060* :  that she's getting customers of all ages in her place called Do.
*27:56.880- 28:02.120* :  In Shanghai, school students are being influenced by their parents and drinking coffee.
*28:02.480- 28:06.760* :  Some granny send their kids to school and then also pub in for coffee.
*28:07.300- 28:11.680* :  Ask one of her customers, how many cups of coffee she normally drinks every day.
*28:14.160- 28:17.440* :  And given the scale of this transformation, you can believe it.
*28:20.460- 28:27.260* :  The Shanghai government says that there are over 8,000 cafes in this city. Now that makes sound like
*28:27.560- 28:32.680* :  a lot, but when you go for a walk around the streets, it becomes easier to believe.
*28:34.320- 28:40.380* :  And there's one and around the corner another, another next to it. In fact, I've counted them
*28:40.400- 28:47.920* :  in this street and I have a stretch of a couple of hundred meters. There are 18 cafes and today,
*28:47.920- 28:53.780* :  they're all filled with people. We're Shanghai differs from most other Chinese cities,
*28:53.820- 29:00.320* :  is that elsewhere large global coffee chains have been making inroads. Here it's the small
*29:00.320- 29:05.840* :  independent outlets that are dotted all through the old heart of town. But most people who speak
*29:05.840- 29:11.920* :  to in the industry don't think that all these cafes can survive. The overheads can be high,
*29:12.300- 29:16.580* :  and with competition so fierce, there's not enough income to cover them.
*29:17.480- 29:23.420* :  I ask Dong Xiaoli, the owner of the cafe hidden track, what advice she'd give to a friend
*29:23.420- 29:28.080* :  who was considering opening a cafe here. Don't do it.
*29:29.280- 29:34.560* :  The investment versus return is awful. You need to buy very expensive machines and put a lot
*29:34.560- 29:39.560* :  of money into decorating. You're only very small amounts of money compared to other industries.
*29:42.260- 29:49.040* :  There by Wang Xi who runs the flower cafe and bar, she's under no illusions as to how tough it
*29:49.040- 29:54.900* :  might be to survive in this market. But he says he can feel a turnaround when it comes to people's
*29:54.960- 30:00.580* :  enthusiasm to get together with their friends over a drink or a coffee post-COVID crisis.
*30:05.740- 30:11.580* :  I'm quite optimistic. I hope the Chinese economy will quickly return to pre-pandemic levels.
*30:13.460- 30:18.400* :  And that's certainly what Beijing is also counting on. With major parts of the Chinese economy
*30:18.400- 30:23.100* :  stuck in the doldrums, the government says it's pushing for domestic consumption labor
*30:23.100- 30:28.760* :  recovery. Well, perhaps the site of customers sitting at little tables and chairs
*30:28.760- 30:37.000* :  staring down Sujo Creek towards a gleaming Shanghai skyline is at least a step in the right direction.
*30:37.920- 30:39.080* :  Stephen McDonald in Shanghai.
