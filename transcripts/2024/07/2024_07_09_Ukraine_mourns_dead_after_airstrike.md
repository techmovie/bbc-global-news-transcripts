*01:20.100- 01:23.520* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.420- 01:31.480* :  I'm Rachel Wright and at 1,300 GMT on Tuesday the 9th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:31.780- 01:35.580* :  Ukraine is in mourning after one of the worst days of attacks in the war,
*01:35.580- 01:42.040* :  with the children's cancer hospital targeted in Kyiv. We examine conflicting claims about who fired
*01:42.040- 01:46.700* :  the missiles that hit the hospital. School students in South Korea have to receive
*01:46.700- 01:51.460* :  suicide prevention education to tackle high suicide rates among young Koreans.
*01:53.060- 01:59.400* :  Also in this podcast, outrage in China over reports that fuel tankers carrying toxic chemicals
*01:59.400- 02:06.900* :  are also transporting cooking oil and more attacks on gay people in Ghana ahead of a new law.
*02:07.180- 02:12.900* :  You drive in home and you feel you're being followed. You go to the mall and then you have to
*02:13.200- 02:15.880* :  make sure you walk with someone as a security.
*02:20.980- 02:26.480* :  We start with Ukraine, a country in mourning after yesterday's missile attack on a children's
*02:26.480- 02:31.420* :  cancer hospital. One of the worst days of the war according to the mayor of Kyiv.
*02:31.420- 02:36.760* :  The pictures of doctors digging for survivors with their bare hands and bald-headed children
*02:36.760- 02:41.840* :  running from the building, holding their drips as they tried to escape, were shocking and haunting.
*02:41.840- 02:48.760* :  38 people were killed and 166 injured as missiles hit many towns across the country.
*02:49.500- 02:55.320* :  Moscow has denied targeting the children's hospital in Kyiv. The Russian foreign ministry spokesman
*02:55.320- 03:01.940* :  Maria Zakorova said that it was a nassam's surface-to-air missile launched by Ukraine that hit
*03:01.940- 03:07.300* :  the hospital. For more on Russia's perspective, James Coppnell has been speaking to Vitaly
*03:07.340- 03:10.180* :  Nalonov, a member of the Russian state, Duma.
*03:20.680- 03:24.220* :  Have you seen the footage of the hospital which has been almost totally destroyed?
*03:25.180- 03:31.100* :  Yeah, absolutely. I've seen the picture and I'm also a member of Russian army right now
*03:31.920- 03:41.780* :  and I've seen a lot of signs that the hospital being hit by antimissile and actually what's
*03:41.780- 03:50.160* :  been done by Ukrainians is that they cannot use antimissile weapons. Russian missile can hit any
*03:50.160- 03:58.700* :  building, totally destroying this building. So it's not been hit by a Russian very powerful missile.
*03:58.700- 04:05.440* :  It's when they're trying to hit Russian missiles that are and as a result,
*04:06.340- 04:10.820* :  these missiles make a lot of damage to civilian buildings.
*04:11.300- 04:17.160* :  Again, the Ukrainians have presented fragments of a Russian missile on the site.
*04:17.180- 04:22.460* :  You talk about Russian missile has done more damage and yet huge amounts of that building.
*04:22.460- 04:25.800* :  There are pictures on the BBC website if people want to go and see images too.
*04:27.600- 04:32.680* :  Huge destruction done to that building. This can't be a proud day for you, can it?
*04:32.680- 04:36.300* :  Is a member of the Russian military to see a children's hospital destroyed in this way?
*04:37.220- 04:44.720* :  Of course, I know that today you have a forthcoming NATO meeting and you have to provide more
*04:44.720- 04:52.180* :  information, more terrifying information to ask for money from the European taxpayers.
*04:52.180- 04:59.700* :  Actually, the only way is to end this war and to establish peace and security in Europe
*05:00.400- 05:07.860* :  is not to provide your weapon to Ukrainians. You know that any case we're going to win this war.
*05:08.480- 05:15.460* :  Vitaly Milanov from the Russian State Duma, but Ukraine says it has found remnants of a Russian
*05:15.460- 05:20.280* :  cruise missile. So let's analyze the claims with Merlin Thomas of BBC Verify.
*05:20.960- 05:27.900* :  We've been looking at two specific videos that show a missile landing into Kiev moments before
*05:27.900- 05:32.580* :  impact and so it's quite rare because daytime attacks are quite rare and that means that you
*05:32.580- 05:37.300* :  actually get to see the missile in this video and what we've done is we've slowed this video
*05:37.300- 05:42.680* :  right down and zoomed in and you can see the missile quite clearly. So we showed five munitions
*05:42.680- 05:47.860* :  expert this video and they all kind of unanimously agreed that this is not a surface-to-air
*05:47.860- 05:52.860* :  defense missile as the Russians have claimed and the reason for that is there are quite tell-tale
*05:52.860- 05:57.220* :  signs when you watch the video, especially for experts. So what they told us is it's because of the
*05:57.220- 06:03.180* :  missile speed, the angle of the attack, you can see it kind of jutting down onto the capital
*06:03.720- 06:08.560* :  as well as the profile. So if you're kind of a weapons expert nerd you can kind of think about
*06:08.560- 06:13.820* :  the box at the bottom of a cylinder as the missile comes in. That is quite a tell-tale sign
*06:13.920- 06:18.860* :  that it is in line actually with what Ukraine have been claiming that this is a land attack cruise
*06:18.860- 06:24.220* :  missile as one of our munitions expert said. As well as that you can also hear when you listen
*06:24.220- 06:29.000* :  to the video, you can hear a kind of whistling sound and one of our weapons experts Timothy
*06:29.000- 06:33.500* :  Wright from the International Institute for Strategic Studies actually said that that sound of a
*06:33.500- 06:38.860* :  high-pitch kind of turbofan is very prominent and it's a dead giveaway, that's what he said.
*06:39.360- 06:45.160* :  But when we kind of go about looking into these videos it can be tricky because there are claims
*06:45.160- 06:49.920* :  and counterclaims and you have to remember that this is something that Russia do all the time,
*06:49.920- 06:54.600* :  they make these kinds of claims. So it's going to say in the past have both sides made false claims.
*06:54.880- 06:58.900* :  Russia makes these claims frequently, this isn't the first time that they've said that Ukraine has
*06:58.900- 07:04.100* :  been responsible for striking its own cities but experts we spoke to unanimously agreed that
*07:04.120- 07:08.100* :  it's not a Ukrainian weapon as claimed by the Russians and that's what we can say so far.
*07:08.800- 07:15.240* :  Merlin Thomas from BBC Verify. According to the World Health Organization, suicide is the fourth
*07:15.240- 07:21.960* :  biggest cause of death among the 15 to 29 age group around the world. In South Korea it's the
*07:21.960- 07:27.960* :  leading cause of death from 9 to 24 year olds. The country's education system is known for its
*07:27.960- 07:32.980* :  high pressure and hyper competitiveness but the long hours and intense competition have
*07:32.980- 07:39.300* :  contributed to mental health problems. From Friday all state school students must attend classes
*07:39.300- 07:45.840* :  on suicide prevention. Jason Lee told me more. Firstly let me give you a broader picture in South
*07:45.840- 07:51.840* :  Korea. South Korea has the highest suicide rate in East Asia and the highest among the world's
*07:51.840- 07:57.540* :  developed nations. Zooming in on this particular issue it's particularly serious for young people
*07:57.540- 08:03.680* :  age between 9 to 24 as you mentioned earlier Rachel with suicide being by far the largest cause of
*08:03.680- 08:09.780* :  death for this age group. Now a recent government report showed a quarter of middle and high school
*08:09.780- 08:15.980* :  students suffer from depression which is a major cause of suicides and that's partly to do with the
*08:15.980- 08:21.900* :  fact that South Korea's education system as you said is notorious for its long hours of studying
*08:21.900- 08:28.000* :  and tough competition. There's this constant pressure to achieve high grades so that you get into
*08:28.000- 08:33.560* :  the top universities and you're constantly, constantly compared to other students by your parents.
*08:34.260- 08:40.120* :  There's a word in Korean I just want to tell you it's roughly translated into the son or daughter
*08:40.120- 08:46.120* :  of my mother's friends. It's a word that's been popular popularized in recent years to denote
*08:46.120- 08:51.160* :  someone's son or daughter who's very successful that your mother constantly raves about and talks about
*08:51.160- 08:56.140* :  and it's a major headache for those who are less successful because you know you feel ashamed
*08:56.140- 09:02.100* :  embarrassed or just simply annoyed by the constant comparison and that whole comparison culture
*09:02.100- 09:07.260* :  that South Korea has and the pressure that comes with it is just too much for many to cope with.
*09:08.300- 09:13.360* :  So it's a cultural issue something is going to be very difficult to combat but this program in
*09:13.360- 09:19.300* :  these classes what what do they do? Well they're mainly comprised of two parts the first is more
*09:19.300- 09:24.960* :  of a theoretical one the aims to educate students on the act of suicide itself this includes lessons
*09:24.960- 09:30.100* :  of factors that contribute to the decline in mental health and ways to manage such conditions.
*09:30.100- 09:35.680* :  The second part is more focused on practical elements such as guidance or supporting students
*09:35.680- 09:41.820* :  exposed to high risk of suicide and teaching them how to recognize such warning signs and take
*09:41.820- 09:49.360* :  necessary measures to prevent them from taking their own lives. Jason Lee Chinese hackers working
*09:49.360- 09:55.600* :  for the government are repeatedly targeting official and private sector networks in Australia and
*09:55.600- 10:01.960* :  across the Asia Pacific region that's the accusation from Australia's cyber intelligence agency
*10:02.380- 10:09.800* :  it's pointing the finger at a group called APT 40 or advanced persistent threat which it says
*10:09.800- 10:15.480* :  works with the help of China's Ministry of State Security. So how significant is it that
*10:15.480- 10:21.880* :  Canberra is making such a direct accusation against Beijing? Catherine Mustard is executive director
*10:22.300- 10:27.540* :  of an Australian cyber security consultancy she's been speaking to James Menendez.
*10:28.060- 10:33.860* :  This is the first time Australia has led on one of these multilateral attributions normally
*10:33.860- 10:39.240* :  it is the US government in the driving seat and it is the Australian government today and we've
*10:39.240- 10:45.980* :  seen not just the usual Anglo sphere of the five eyes countries joining this statement of the UK
*10:46.140- 10:53.040* :  Australia the US New Zealand and Canada but also some non-traditional democracies as well
*10:53.580- 11:00.620* :  in South Korea, Japan and Germany. So an increasingly broad based group of countries he really
*11:00.620- 11:05.380* :  drawing a line in the sand and saying what they think is not acceptable in side of space.
*11:06.160- 11:12.380* :  And why do you think Australia is doing this? Is it a sign of growing confidence that Australia has
*11:12.380- 11:17.880* :  the the clout to call this out or is it just fed up of all this hacking going on?
*11:18.160- 11:22.620* :  You're right I think the tempo of what a lot of different democracies are seeing from China
*11:22.620- 11:27.080* :  and other authoritarian governments in this space is really increasing. So partly there's a lot more
*11:27.080- 11:33.620* :  of the malicious activity happening. I think also there is less tolerance for activity that targets
*11:33.660- 11:39.960* :  businesses, the private sector, democratic institutions when it comes to espionage as well and
*11:40.080- 11:44.400* :  again Australia is not alone here in New Zealand for the first time ever. A couple of months ago
*11:44.400- 11:51.000* :  pointed the finger to the same Chinese hacking group. The other part is it's not just Australia here
*11:51.000- 11:57.980* :  talking to China. It's actually I would say Australia talking to like-minded partners to say
*11:58.420- 12:04.240* :  we are all agreeing on what some of the norms inside of space are and also Australia talking
*12:04.240- 12:09.640* :  to its own citizens and businesses because it's those businesses and citizens that actually can
*12:09.640- 12:14.860* :  do the most here to keep Australia's defences up because most of our industries of course
*12:15.360- 12:20.620* :  in private hands a lot of this targeting is across the economy. So it's about sharing information
*12:20.620- 12:25.220* :  about this threat so that those outside of government can do something about it as well.
*12:26.020- 12:29.640* :  The Chinese government through the Chinese Embassy in Canberra has said that China does not
*12:29.640- 12:36.540* :  encourage support or condone attacks launched by hackers. I mean it's that credible. This group
*12:36.540- 12:42.480* :  APT 40 is there no doubt that it is part of the Chinese government, the Ministry of State Security.
*12:43.260- 12:48.220* :  It's not just Western liberal democracies saying that a couple of months ago Microsoft
*12:48.300- 12:55.440* :  I said that it had seen this group APT 40 are hacking across more or less every country in the
*12:55.440- 13:01.340* :  South Pacific in the last year. So I think look it's it's very expected we hear this from China
*13:01.340- 13:06.460* :  all the time when governments point the finger at China invariably they come back and say look it's
*13:06.460- 13:11.660* :  not us. The reasonable readers and viewers of these types of statements will draw their own
*13:11.660- 13:17.000* :  conclusions about the veracity of those claims. People listening will also probably be thinking
*13:17.000- 13:20.780* :  well hold on aren't Australia and it's allies almost certainly doing the same sort of thing to
*13:20.780- 13:27.960* :  Chinese public and private companies. Yeah look it's a fair question and it's also fair to say
*13:27.960- 13:33.920* :  almost every government in the world does some kind of espionage. I think what different here is
*13:33.920- 13:40.100* :  a couple of things. One is the scale and ubiquity of APT 40 is Chinese hacking group but also
*13:40.620- 13:45.900* :  the uses that intelligence is put to the Ministry of State Security is of course China's internal
*13:45.900- 13:51.580* :  secret police and it's also known not just for trying to understand matters of state
*13:51.580- 13:57.780* :  but sometimes an increasingly quiet ubiquitously targeting dissidents, diaspora groups,
*13:57.820- 14:02.380* :  those who threaten the political security of the Chinese Communist Party. It's also known
*14:02.380- 14:08.420* :  for commercial intelligence stealing IP. Some would say China's responsible for the greatest
*14:08.420- 14:14.140* :  transfer of wealth in history in terms of what has been a lot of this group APT 40's role
*14:14.140- 14:19.620* :  in economic espionage and that's I think with a lot of democratic countries are now drawing
*14:19.620- 14:25.220* :  the line and saying these types of activity we don't think is acceptable. Catherine Mustard
*14:25.220- 14:31.840* :  talking to James Minendez. A food scandal has hit China following reports on social media
*14:31.840- 14:37.480* :  that fuel tanker trucks are being used to transport cooking oil and other food products.
*14:38.100- 14:42.620* :  Chinese officials have now launched what they call a major investigation. Our China
*14:43.240- 14:48.660* :  correspondence Stephen McDonald reports. People in China have been expressing shock on social media
*14:49.240- 14:54.480* :  after discovering that there are no regulations here preventing tankers which are carrying toxic
*14:54.720- 15:00.120* :  coal oil one day from then transporting cooking oil or other food products the next.
*15:00.860- 15:05.440* :  Not only are the lorries allowed to do this but according to reports on local state-run media
*15:05.440- 15:10.560* :  this is exactly what they've been doing and without properly cleaning the tankers in between.
*15:11.300- 15:16.180* :  The practices said to have been so widespread that it's been considered an open secret in the
*15:16.180- 15:22.220* :  industry according to one driver quoted in the Beijing News. Sino-Grain, a massive government
*15:22.220- 15:27.300* :  operated grain stockpiler has announced an internal inquiry into its own operations
*15:27.300- 15:32.660* :  and both the Herbe and Tianjin provincial governments so they're also looking into the matter.
*15:33.320- 15:38.900* :  However this follows a long line of food security scandals in China which have led to consider
*15:38.900- 15:43.680* :  will public mistrust in the capability of officials to ensure that the country's produce
*15:43.680- 15:50.140* :  is safe to consume. The China's tankers have been carrying food products straight after they've
*15:50.140- 15:56.160* :  transported toxic materials containing the sulfides, benzene and various hydrocarbons
*15:56.640- 16:02.220* :  as yet again eroded public confidence in food quality and it will take a lot for this to be
*16:02.460- 16:04.360* :  rebuilt. Stephen McDonald
*16:07.220- 16:12.660* :  coming up will bring you a report from Australia where foreigners with disabilities are often
*16:12.660- 16:18.040* :  denied a residency visa. We're saying not implicitly but directly to people living with
*16:18.040- 16:22.400* :  disability in this country you are not welcome here given the opportunity we would rather not have you.
*16:29.640- 16:35.280* :  As you record the pod, world leaders from NATO's 32 member countries are gathered in Washington
*16:35.280- 16:41.860* :  for a summit to mark the alliance's 75th anniversary. President Zelensky is also there.
*16:41.860- 16:48.320* :  Ukraine was already top of the agenda and NATO's leaders have condemned Monday's missile attacks
*16:48.320- 16:54.300* :  but how far can they go in their support? Gives immediate hopes for membership of the organization
*16:54.300- 16:59.460* :  seem likely to be dashed again as our State Department correspondent Tom Baikman reports.
*17:03.380- 17:09.100* :  Well I'm standing next to the blast barriers and the iron security fencing and security cameras
*17:09.100- 17:15.220* :  of the Russian Embassy here in Washington DC. Definitely not invited to the NATO summit
*17:15.620- 17:20.480* :  but we've come here because of what's on the other side of the street and from all four homes
*17:20.620- 17:29.360* :  facing the Russian Embassy they're hanging Ukrainian flags. Across town world leaders are
*17:29.360- 17:34.860* :  arriving to celebrate an alliance whose basis is a one for all and all for one pledge to defend
*17:34.860- 17:41.940* :  each other against attacks. Ukraine wants in to NATO but despite this 75th anniversary summit
*17:42.340- 17:47.680* :  for an alliance forged in the ashes of destruction from the Second World War there will be no
*17:47.680- 18:01.360* :  NATO birthday present for President Zelensky. That was last year's summit, a Biden Zelensky meeting
*18:01.360- 18:08.100* :  where the US President resisted Ukraine's calls to enter NATO quickly. He fears escalation with Russia
*18:08.100- 18:14.040* :  if that were to happen soon. Now NATO is offering what the US calls a bridge to membership,
*18:14.060- 18:20.380* :  a short one it says but still Mr. Zelensky may have to hide the disappointment he showed more clearly
*18:20.380- 18:26.340* :  last time. Today some Biden supporters see this approach as too risk sensitive and call for
*18:26.340- 18:32.660* :  clear and NATO pledges for Kiev like Evelyn Farcast who ran Russia and Ukraine policy at the Pentagon
*18:32.660- 18:39.840* :  under President Obama. I mean if Vladimir Putin is made to understand that the territory that
*18:39.840- 18:47.200* :  Ukraine now has control over that if Russia takes one step into those territories that we would
*18:47.740- 18:52.340* :  NATO would come to Ukraine's defense I think if we communicated that clearly to Putin he would
*18:52.340- 18:57.720* :  understand that he does not want war with NATO. Quite a gamble though is a potential move.
*18:58.020- 19:02.880* :  It is a gamble but I do think we should do everything we can to accelerate admitting
*19:02.880- 19:08.300* :  Ukraine into NATO. Instead of membership at the end of this summit there are likely to be pledges
*19:08.300- 19:15.040* :  to Ukraine to coordinate aid through NATO possibly via a new mission in Germany. Alongside a series
*19:15.040- 19:21.560* :  of one-on-one security packs countries have been making with Kiev including the US but many in the
*19:21.560- 19:28.340* :  room are worried all this can't be made Trump proof. NATO was busted until I came along I said
*19:28.340- 19:33.240* :  everybody's going to pay they said well if we don't pay are you still going to protect us I
*19:33.240- 19:37.720* :  said absolutely not they couldn't believe the answer. One of several comments made by the
*19:37.720- 19:44.060* :  former president to the horror of NATO supporters earlier this year the EU commissioner Tieri Breton
*19:44.060- 19:50.480* :  recounted a story of a meeting in 2020 with Mr. Trump and the EU chief Ursula von der Leyen.
*19:50.820- 19:58.360* :  And all that Trump said to Ursula you need to understand that if Europe is under attack
*19:58.360- 20:06.000* :  we will never come to help you and to support you and by the way NATO is dead and we will live
*20:06.000- 20:13.360* :  we will quit NATO. It was the president of the United States of America he may come back.
*20:14.240- 20:19.480* :  Donald Trump took credit for his erratic approach as president boosting NATO countries'
*20:19.480- 20:24.760* :  defense spending although most increases have come since due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*20:24.780- 20:29.800* :  Dan Koldwell from the right wing of think tank defense priorities says a second Trump term
*20:30.240- 20:35.040* :  would add to the pressure on the alliance. I don't think he wants to withdraw from NATO
*20:35.560- 20:41.940* :  but he has said that the United States should reevaluate its role and the purpose of NATO
*20:41.940- 20:50.900* :  going forward. In particular I think that he and others around him think that the Europeans
*20:50.900- 20:59.140* :  need to bear more of the financial burden in funding NATO and also I think bear more of the
*20:59.140- 21:08.180* :  burden in actually securing Europe as a whole. As the NATO anthem plays in Washington European
*21:08.180- 21:12.920* :  countries know they have to put more into their own defenses to keep the guarantee of U.S.
*21:12.920- 21:19.440* :  protection. Few in Europe want to pay the price of being outside NATO now but the costs of membership
*21:27.460- 21:33.220* :  are going up. Our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman human rights organisations are warning
*21:33.220- 21:38.620* :  that gay people in Ghana are experiencing an increase in attacks directed at them since the
*21:38.620- 21:45.140* :  country's parliament passed a tough new anti-LGBT bill earlier this year. The president hasn't yet
*21:45.140- 21:51.060* :  signed it into law as it's been challenged at the country's supreme court. gay sex is already
*21:51.060- 21:56.800* :  punishable with up to three years in jail. Under the law people convicted of identifying as
*21:56.800- 22:04.060* :  LGBT could get the same punishment it would also affect people around them ban any organisation
*22:04.060- 22:10.680* :  advocating for their rights and media organisation accused of promoting an LGBT lifestyle.
*22:11.460- 22:18.760* :  Mac Darling Cobbner is an LGBT activist in Ghana. He says homophobes are being emboldened by
*22:18.760- 22:24.160* :  the prospective law and shared what life looks like for him now as an openly gay man.
*22:24.920- 22:31.300* :  You drive in home then you feel you are being followed. You go to the mall and then you have to
*22:31.620- 22:37.540* :  make sure you work with someone as a security protection or you are the restaurant some people
*22:37.540- 22:42.360* :  walk up there and they touch with me lead you and when they attack you they are safe.
*22:42.960- 22:48.420* :  Amnesty International says many are too afraid to report attacks to the police but that their
*22:48.420- 22:55.040* :  data is showing an increase of violence attacks provocations blackmail extortion and forced
*22:55.040- 23:02.340* :  evictions of LGBT people. Genevieve Partington is the organisation's country director for Ghana.
*23:02.900- 23:07.240* :  She's called the bill draconian and urged the president not to sign it.
*23:07.540- 23:14.880* :  Extortion has really been on the rise it's extremely disturbing what is going on and if anyone says
*23:14.920- 23:19.880* :  there are no increased cases of violence then I believe they don't have their facts.
*23:20.620- 23:26.500* :  Sam George is the Ghanaian MP who introduced the anti-LGBT legislation into parliament.
*23:26.500- 23:33.240* :  He spoke to my colleague Ed Butler and began by explaining why he wanted to tighten the law further.
*23:34.140- 23:38.940* :  We're very conservative people we are not interested in what people do in the privacy of their
*23:38.940- 23:43.200* :  bedrooms but when they want to make their private matters issues of public and
*23:43.200- 23:48.800* :  advocacy then the public gets very riled up and so I indicated I was going to bring in legislation
*23:49.620- 23:55.360* :  that was going to tighten Ghana's family values and anti homosexuality legislation which is what I've
*23:55.360- 24:02.780* :  done. This new law criminalizes what was already criminal gay love and it also potentially forces
*24:02.780- 24:09.160* :  people who are even relatives and friends of people who might be gay to report on them to snatch
*24:10.060- 24:15.920* :  that's actually not correct the provision you're speaking about is titled the duty to report
*24:15.920- 24:23.020* :  and prohibition of extra judicial treatment so it says that anybody who has knowledge of the
*24:23.680- 24:30.400* :  commission of an offense has a duty to report it and not to carry out extra judicial treatment
*24:30.400- 24:35.000* :  which is something that the LGBTQ community themselves have complained about and which is
*24:35.000- 24:41.000* :  something I agree that no matter their sense anybody commits in Ghana they have the right to
*24:41.000- 24:46.400* :  a fair trial and then that mob justice must not be let it out to them. Well what they're saying
*24:46.400- 24:51.800* :  to us what people are saying to us is that not only did these attacks against gay people happen
*24:51.800- 24:56.400* :  before but now that this law has been introduced and all the publicity attached to it it hasn't
*24:56.400- 25:01.480* :  been obviously signed by the president but now this law has been passed through parliament it has
*25:01.480- 25:08.440* :  now a massive increase in the amount of attacks on gay people specific black male threats violence
*25:08.440- 25:14.240* :  against them the life is becoming harder and harder and more and more intolerable. Well this is
*25:14.240- 25:19.560* :  the BBC we're talking I'm talking to I mean I expect that the BBC verify whatever information is
*25:19.560- 25:24.560* :  brought to you. I am just reporting what's being reported to me. Yeah but if there is any evidence
*25:24.560- 25:30.820* :  of increased violence you will have reports of that in police reports absolutely no such things
*25:30.820- 25:35.480* :  exist here. I understand international are saying the same thing. I understand international
*25:35.480- 25:41.020* :  is saying the same thing. The fact that I understand international is saying that doesn't mean that
*25:41.020- 25:49.300* :  it is verified. I live in Ghana I can dare anybody to show you an increased number of attacks
*25:49.340- 25:55.820* :  on homosexuals in Ghana there is no such evidence look between January and March and I haven't
*25:55.820- 26:01.740* :  checked the latest figures there's been no matter in Ghana over homosexuality and not because of
*26:01.740- 26:07.340* :  this legislation. So you need to begin to interrogate these things and I just swallow line who can
*26:07.340- 26:12.520* :  sinker people who realize that the West has overly become woke and are trying to drive you down
*26:12.520- 26:19.180* :  or call the sack. I am challenging any media house I'm challenging anybody to show evidence
*26:19.180- 26:26.320* :  of attacks against homosexuals in Ghana on the increase. Even if you can point to me an increase
*26:26.320- 26:32.840* :  of one percent I will eat the humble pie and withdraw my bill. Sam George speaking to Ed Butler
*26:33.320- 26:40.220* :  and in the latest episode of Business Daily Ed looks at what consequences the anti-LGBT bill has had
*26:40.540- 26:45.360* :  on foreign investment in Ghana. There have been warnings that the bill could threaten Ghana as much
*26:45.360- 26:51.220* :  needed donor funding from places like the World Bank and the IMF search for Business Daily wherever
*26:51.220- 26:59.160* :  you get your BBC podcasts. Now Australia is a migration nation a third of its population was
*26:59.160- 27:06.140* :  born abroad and it prides itself on its multiculturalism but there's a big exception disabled people
*27:06.140- 27:11.980* :  of those with medical conditions. The rules are so strict that many foreigners with disabilities
*27:11.980- 27:18.940* :  or medical conditions are routinely denied an Australian visa and those already living in Australia
*27:18.940- 27:24.880* :  face the threat of being made to leave. But campaigners are pressuring ministers to do better
*27:25.200- 27:31.800* :  and hoping for change as our Australia correspondent Katie Watson now reports from Perth in Western Australia.
*27:33.000- 27:43.220* :  He's only just learnt to walk but to your old Luca is already kicking a ball like a pro. Born
*27:43.220- 27:49.000* :  in Australia this is home. Mum Laura and Dad Dante moved here from Scotland eight years ago
*27:49.000- 27:55.500* :  for jobs that Australia desperately needs. Laura's a nursery teacher, Dante, a painter decorator.
*27:55.820- 28:00.240* :  But the life they've built here could be pulled from them in an instant. Luca was born with
*28:00.280- 28:05.520* :  cystic fibrosis. Australia says because of that they can't stay here permanently. He's a burden.
*28:07.380- 28:11.440* :  I think I cried for like a week. I just feel really really sorry for him like he's just
*28:11.440- 28:15.620* :  had fenced us two and a half years old and you know just as needed is there to be discriminated
*28:15.620- 28:22.400* :  and that way. The sticking point is Luca's treatment. Australia says it will cost around
*28:22.400- 28:28.220* :  $1.3 million. The family are now appealing against the decision that they lose they'll have to
*28:28.220- 28:32.320* :  leave the country. It's like we're here for you when you need us but you know when the
*28:32.320- 28:37.140* :  bulls are reversed and and we need you it's like no sorry cost you much money away you go back to
*28:37.140- 28:41.040* :  your own country even though we've lived and and paid into your country for the last eight years
*28:41.040- 28:47.280* :  it's just a bit heartbreaking. You're driving the rhino along the beach and sometimes you know
*28:47.280- 28:51.520* :  you've got to pinch yourself and and realise you're getting paid to do it you know. Australia's
*28:51.520- 28:56.580* :  actively looking for migrant workers to fill skills gaps. Police forces across the country want
*28:56.580- 29:01.400* :  British officers to sign up. Their promotional videos show officers on beach patrols in
*29:01.400- 29:07.020* :  sandbuggies and living for dream. They make up just some of the 30,000 brits who moved to Australia
*29:07.020- 29:13.700* :  last year. Are you having butter? No, no butter, no butter. Glare Day is hoping to be one of them.
*29:13.900- 29:18.780* :  She's worked for London's Metropolitan Police for 21 years. She has two job offers,
*29:19.240- 29:24.680* :  one from Queensland's Police Service and another from South Australia. But even if they want her
*29:24.820- 29:31.060* :  she won't get in. Her younger daughter Darcy has Down syndrome. I had hoped that it wouldn't be an
*29:31.060- 29:35.680* :  issue because she doesn't have any medical problems. She's fit and she's healthy. It's a bit
*29:35.680- 29:41.220* :  bittersweet really because the likelihood of me being grinded at a visa is pretty much zero.
*29:44.860- 29:49.460* :  The issue facing migrants with disabilities or chronic medical conditions is this. It doesn't
*29:49.460- 29:54.180* :  matter if you're born here how long you've lived here. If you have private health insurance or even
*29:54.180- 29:59.760* :  if you can pay for the support yourself, if your health and welfare costs could exceed 86,000
*29:59.760- 30:05.600* :  Australian dollars over maximum of 10 years, that's around 60,000 US dollars, you fail the medical
*30:05.600- 30:10.780* :  requirement. While you can apply for a waiver and appeal, not all visas give you that option.
*30:11.300- 30:15.560* :  It's a lengthy and expensive process and there's still no guarantee it will be granted.
*30:15.660- 30:21.920* :  In 2019, the UN warned Australia its policies could be discriminating against disabled migrants
*30:29.220- 30:32.640* :  and their families. Australia's got form when it comes to strict and historically racist
*30:32.640- 30:37.960* :  immigration policies. In 1901, Australia introduced the Immigration Restriction Act,
*30:38.380- 30:42.220* :  that kickstarted a period which limited non-white immigrants moving to Australia.
*30:42.220- 30:47.780* :  Policies that lasted until the 1970s. Immigration lawyer John Gothard explained.
*30:48.060- 30:52.460* :  Most people think of the white Australia policy or immigration restriction in terms of people
*30:52.500- 30:56.580* :  of colour and those racist provisions have been removed, the racial discrimination
*30:56.580- 31:01.980* :  act meant in theory, the interracial discrimination, but the disability discrimination act did not
*31:01.980- 31:06.860* :  get rid of the disability and health discriminations which were set up in 1901.
*31:07.240- 31:11.060* :  The Immigration Minister wouldn't give us an interview. Their department did say though
*31:11.060- 31:16.740* :  the government was reviewing the health requirements. Katie Watson reporting from Perth.
*31:19.160- 31:24.200* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*32:00.160- 32:07.440* :  by creating their own version of American Idol. The joy they brought to the nation.
