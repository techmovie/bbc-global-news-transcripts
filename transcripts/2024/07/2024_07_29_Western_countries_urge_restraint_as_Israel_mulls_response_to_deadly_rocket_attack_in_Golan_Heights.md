*01:43.180- 01:46.520* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:48.100- 01:52.940* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in the early hours of Monday, the 29th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:52.940- 01:58.280* :  Western countries have urged Israel to show restraint as the government decides how to respond
*01:58.280- 02:03.000* :  to a deadly attack in the occupied Golan Heights which it's blamed on Hezbollah.
*02:03.720- 02:07.580* :  Venezuela's attorney general dismisses suggestions that the presidential election
*02:07.580- 02:13.160* :  currently taking place might not have been fair. At the Paris Olympics, American gymnast Simone
*02:13.160- 02:18.140* :  Biles has made an impressive return after having to withdraw from much of the Tokyo games
*02:18.200- 02:20.380* :  we'll hear about her and the other highlights.
*02:22.780- 02:27.700* :  Also in this podcast, the Irish author Edna O'Brien, best known for her groundbreaking
*02:27.700- 02:34.020* :  country girl's trilogy, has died age 93. Ireland in many ways has a great gear to,
*02:34.580- 02:39.340* :  but alongside that gear, to you always pay the price, a great sort of melancholy.
*02:43.820- 02:49.280* :  We begin in the Middle East. Western diplomats and politicians are scrambling to deescalate
*02:49.280- 02:55.100* :  tension between Israel and Hezbollah, following Saturday's rocket strike on the Israeli-occupied
*02:55.100- 03:01.820* :  Golan Heights which killed 12 young people. As fears grow of a major war, the urging Israel to show
*03:01.820- 03:08.560* :  restraint in any military response. The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a 4-hour emergency
*03:08.560- 03:14.520* :  meeting of the security cabinet late on Sunday. Early other White House also blamed Hezbollah for
*03:14.520- 03:19.920* :  the attack. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken repeated the United States' long-held
*03:19.920- 03:24.720* :  position that it didn't want the conflict to spread. We're in conversations with the government
*03:24.720- 03:31.840* :  of Israel. And again, I emphasize, it's right to defend its citizens and our determination
*03:32.920- 03:38.940* :  to make sure that they're able to do that. But we also don't want to see the conflict escalate,
*03:38.940- 03:45.580* :  we don't want to see it spread. That has been one of our goals from day one, from October 7th on.
*03:46.080- 03:50.740* :  Hezbollah denies responsibility for the strike and says a projectile from Israel's
*03:50.740- 03:56.620* :  iron-dome defense system hit the town of Magdal Shams. The victims of Saturday's attack
*03:56.620- 04:01.600* :  belonged to the Arabic-speaking Drew's community, a distinct religious and ethnic group
*04:01.600- 04:08.080* :  that makes up 1.5% of Israel's population. Earlier, the funerals took place for the children
*04:08.080- 04:13.420* :  who lost their lives. Our correspondent Paul Adams spent the day there and told us about the
*04:13.420- 04:21.060* :  atmosphere. We've been here in Magdal Shams all day and what a day it's been, a really profound
*04:21.060- 04:28.640* :  sense of grief and shock that is descended on this small Drew's community. In this rather remote
*04:28.640- 04:33.920* :  corner of the country, this is the Golan Heights, which have been under Israeli control since 1967.
*04:35.240- 04:41.340* :  This is a community that is very tight-knit, that clings to its roots, a place where people have
*04:41.340- 04:47.140* :  not left, despite the large evacuations that have gone on elsewhere across northern Israel
*04:47.620- 04:51.320* :  in the last 10 months. The Drew's community here in the Golan has stayed put.
*04:52.720- 04:55.420* :  But of course, they have feared all along that something like this could happen,
*04:55.940- 05:02.620* :  and sure enough, it has, and it has left them absolutely stunned. Here's just a flavor of what
*05:02.620- 05:10.140* :  today has been like. Through the streets of Magdal Shams, the coffins came one by one.
*05:10.580- 05:16.720* :  This town is reeling in shock, consumed by collective grief. For months they feared a disaster,
*05:17.420- 05:22.800* :  they never imagined it would take away their children. At the football pitch where they died,
*05:22.800- 05:29.100* :  people came to pay respects and take in the scale and speed of this tragedy. A playground transformed
*05:29.100- 05:35.460* :  in an instant into a place of jagged metal, discarded belongings, and in the corner the blood of the
*05:35.460- 05:42.760* :  victims. As government ministers arrived, the mood turned. There was anger, even from a soldier.
*05:44.540- 05:49.740* :  They've been bombarding us for 10 months, he shouted, my children are crying every day.
*05:51.100- 05:57.080* :  Israel's hard-line finance minister, Bezal El-Smotridge, was here, some urged the government to
*05:57.080- 06:02.200* :  crack down hard on Hezbollah. Others told him in no uncertain terms to leave.
*06:02.200- 06:08.820* :  Ugarit Abu Awad knows a response will come, but is deeply fearful.
*06:09.580- 06:14.800* :  There should be a response, but I don't think there should be like an all-out-for business
*06:14.800- 06:20.540* :  war load right now. Why? Because I'm afraid for the consequences, it's just happened yesterday.
*06:20.580- 06:27.300* :  What about tomorrow if it happens like it gets to an all-out-for? It's going to be pretty though.
*06:28.220- 06:33.720* :  More people are going to die on all sides. Humanity is already suffering enough, I think.
*06:34.540- 06:41.620* :  The security cabinet has been meeting today to talk about a response. What kind of response
*06:41.620- 06:48.880* :  might be expected? This is a difficult calculation. This is the moment that many people, diplomats and
*06:48.880- 06:56.320* :  Israelis and Lebanese have been worrying about for the past 10 months. Is this the trigger for an
*06:56.320- 07:01.660* :  all-out conflict? Something much bigger than the simmering tip-foot-out exchanges we have seen
*07:01.700- 07:09.800* :  for the past 9 or 10 months. There are no immediate signs of a large-scale military operation.
*07:09.880- 07:15.300* :  We're not seeing the mobilization of troops, the massing of armor on the border, no immediate
*07:15.300- 07:21.560* :  sign of an invasion of southern Lebanon. Despite the Israeli government's keen desire to create
*07:21.560- 07:27.320* :  some kind of buffer zone in southern Lebanon that would prevent Hezbollah from being able to
*07:27.320- 07:35.140* :  launch rockets into Israel. As you say, the security cabinet has been meeting and the statement
*07:35.140- 07:39.100* :  that was released following that meeting said the members of the cabinet authorize the Prime
*07:39.100- 07:45.480* :  Minister and Defence Minister to decide on the manner and timing of the response. No clues there.
*07:45.480- 07:52.880* :  I think everyone is expecting some increased level of Israeli military activity, whether it
*07:52.880- 07:58.120* :  will amount to the kind of full-scale escalation that people fear. Well, we just don't know
*07:58.680- 08:04.620* :  an escalation on this border could have all sorts of ramifications, could worsen the conflict in
*08:04.620- 08:11.220* :  Gaza, could wreck prospects for a ceasefire talks there, could draw Iran further back into this conflict.
*08:11.280- 08:16.980* :  There are all sorts of implications, all of which are pretty dire. There have been talks in
*08:16.980- 08:24.540* :  Rome about a potential ceasefire for Gaza. Any news on that at all? Nothing terribly convincing
*08:24.540- 08:30.780* :  that I've heard anyway. They seem to be almost talks about talks or talks for the sake of being
*08:30.780- 08:38.200* :  there and being seen to have talks. The Americans were saying today that a successful conclusion
*08:38.360- 08:43.680* :  of those ceasefire negotiations could have a very positive knock-on effect here in the northern
*08:43.680- 08:51.360* :  border could de-escalate the conflict because after all, Hasbalah have ramped up the pressure on
*08:51.360- 08:57.180* :  the northern border precisely because of the war in Gaza. So a lot hinges on the outcome of those
*08:57.180- 09:02.820* :  ceasefire negotiations. There do still seem to be some major obstacles, even though the Americans
*09:02.820- 09:07.940* :  have been saying for the past week or so, that we're in the kind of home stretch. But clearly
*09:07.980- 09:14.020* :  all eyes will be on those talks to see if they get anywhere that so many previous rounds haven't
*09:14.020- 09:20.860* :  so far. Paul Adams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, to Venezuela next. And as we record
*09:20.860- 09:26.940* :  this podcast, Poles closed just a short time ago in an election described as the biggest challenge
*09:26.940- 09:33.620* :  to the governing socialist PSUV party since it came to part 25 years ago. Opinion Poles have suggested
*09:33.620- 09:39.600* :  that President Nicolas Maduro, who is running for his third consecutive term, could be defeated by
*09:39.600- 09:45.780* :  the opposition coalition candidate, retired diplomat Edmondo Gonzales. There have been questions
*09:45.780- 09:51.660* :  over whether the election would be free and fair, but the Attorney General Tarek Sab sought to
*09:58.180- 10:01.620* :  assuage concerns. As the Attorney General, I can faithfully say with four guarantees
*10:02.460- 10:07.620* :  that the electoral system of Venezuela is fully protected and one of the best automated voting
*10:07.620- 10:13.480* :  systems on the planet. Therefore, when the National Electoral Council announces who has won,
*10:13.580- 10:19.560* :  there shouldn't be any doubts who is the winner. I have no doubt that during the night we'll have
*10:19.560- 10:26.620* :  the results. Everything here will be calm, peaceful, peace will win. The opposition's original
*10:26.620- 10:31.940* :  choice, Maria Corina Machado, was banned from running for office, but after casting her vote,
*10:31.940- 10:42.720* :  she said she was confident for Venezuela's future. Today, Venezuela is united. We've been united
*10:42.720- 10:49.540* :  for many years in the hope that we will be free, and today it is a certainty. We're going to
*10:49.540- 10:54.220* :  be free, we're going to bring our children back home, we're going to unite the country,
*10:54.860- 10:59.660* :  and we're going to have achieved the most important civic and libertarian journey in the history
*10:59.660- 11:05.580* :  of our country. Our South America correspondent Ioni Wells spoke to us from a busy street in the
*11:05.580- 11:11.580* :  Capitol Caracas, so how free and fair was the election? Certainly, there have been concerns raised
*11:11.580- 11:16.160* :  today about some of the practices around the country. I was at some polling stations where there
*11:16.160- 11:21.740* :  were huge cues outside of people waiting, but very few people being allowed in at any one time,
*11:21.740- 11:25.640* :  and there were accusations leveled at the electoral authorities that this was the deliberate
*11:25.640- 11:30.800* :  tactic to try and delay people voting, perhaps in the hope that some people might give up entirely,
*11:30.800- 11:36.240* :  and go home. There's also a footage that we've seen from other parts of the country where protests
*11:36.240- 11:40.880* :  broke out because poll stations just didn't open completely, and that caused clashes between people
*11:40.880- 11:46.280* :  hoping to vote and the electoral authorities and police who were at the station. Now, as I say,
*11:46.380- 11:49.920* :  we don't yet know the result of this election, we don't know what the result's going to be,
*11:49.920- 11:55.080* :  who will claim victory, but certainly there is a huge amount at stake here. As you mentioned there,
*11:55.720- 12:00.060* :  the governing party had been in power for decades, Nicolas Maduro, the president is hoping to be
*12:00.060- 12:05.500* :  re-elected for a third term, and he's called on people today to respect the result of this election,
*12:05.500- 12:11.360* :  but there have been significant concerns that he may not do that himself, and even in the build-up
*12:11.360- 12:14.580* :  of this election as well, there have been concerns about the fact that, for example,
*12:14.580- 12:19.500* :  Opposition candidates were banned from running, some members of the opposition's teams have been
*12:19.500- 12:24.080* :  detained, and millions of Venezuelans living abroad were unable to register to vote,
*12:24.440- 12:27.960* :  so there have been concerns already raised about whether some of the opposition vote has been
*12:27.960- 12:35.620* :  suppressed. And what have been the biggest issues that Venezuelan voters are concerned about?
*12:36.520- 12:41.700* :  Well, the main one is the economy. The economy here has been in three full for about a decade.
*12:41.740- 12:47.120* :  People are really struggling more than half the country lives in poverty, and that's despite the
*12:47.120- 12:51.740* :  fact that this should, in theory, be a country with huge amounts of potential, huge amounts of
*12:51.740- 12:56.340* :  resource. It's the country which has the biggest oil reserves, for example, in the world. And yet
*12:56.620- 13:01.720* :  this Maduro's critics blame economic mismanagement corruption for the state of the economy.
*13:01.720- 13:06.820* :  He blamed sanctions that the US imposed after the last elections were widely dismissed,
*13:06.820- 13:12.240* :  as neither free nor fair, as well as that, but related to it is the fact that millions and
*13:12.240- 13:17.760* :  millions of Venezuelans have emigrated abroad to try and find a better life. And lots of
*13:17.760- 13:21.460* :  voters have spoken to today have raised the point that they just want their children to come home,
*13:21.460- 13:25.500* :  they want their families to be reunited, and that is something which is at stake here as well today.
*13:26.500- 13:31.920* :  Irony Wells on a very busy street in Caracas. The Irish author Edna O'Brien,
*13:31.920- 13:38.100* :  best known for her groundbreaking country girl's trilogy, has died age 93 after a long illness.
*13:38.100- 13:42.800* :  Paying tribute, her publisher Faber said she revolutionized Irish literature,
*13:42.800- 13:47.140* :  capturing the lives of women and the complexities of the human condition.
*13:47.140- 13:53.720* :  The Irish president, Michael D. Higgins, described her as a fearless teller of truths. Vincent Doud
*13:53.720- 13:57.940* :  looks back at Edna O'Brien's career, which spanned more than five decades.
*13:58.620- 14:04.300* :  Edna O'Brien came from rural county Claire in Ireland and was educated at a boarding school
*14:04.300- 14:10.880* :  by nuns. To escape what she called all pervasive small-time catharsism, she became a pharmacist
*14:10.880- 14:17.240* :  in Dublin, moving to London and starting to write. In 1960 she found success with the novel
*14:17.240- 14:21.800* :  The Country Girls, but it was Ireland which had given O'Brien her material.
*14:22.300- 14:29.040* :  I find that in my present life in London I am visited by the weather and the people,
*14:29.040- 14:35.680* :  the sensations of my childhood and I hate to have had a happy childhood because then one might
*14:35.680- 14:41.960* :  have forgotten it. Ireland in many ways has a great gayity, but alongside that gayity you always
*14:42.020- 14:44.980* :  pay the price, a great sort of melancholy.
*14:48.980- 14:54.840* :  The Country Girls was open about sex and critical of Ireland's men, in particular. The novel was
*14:54.840- 15:01.300* :  banned there, but widely read. The follow-up was filmed as girl with green eyes and O'Brien
*15:01.300- 15:09.600* :  wrote the screenplay. My father has a farm, over to tell papa everything except about you.
*15:19.100- 15:25.000* :  In the decades that followed Ireland became far less repressive, a process her early novels had
*15:25.000- 15:31.460* :  encouraged, but O'Brien chose to live mainly in London. She'd moved to the UK with her husband,
*15:31.460- 15:37.920* :  the novelist Ernest Gabler, but the marriage ended. Edna O'Brien had a rare charisma and glamour,
*15:37.920- 15:45.160* :  she was never short of male admirers. She wrote many more novels and for the stage, TV and cinema.
*15:45.160- 15:52.020* :  In 2018 she was made a Dame of the British Empire, an honorary award, because to the end,
*15:52.020- 15:59.180* :  Edna O'Brien remained an Irish woman. Vincent Doubt on the life of the Irish author Edna O'Brien
*15:59.580- 16:07.940* :  aged 93. Still to come. Electric powered luggage is a new and unusual mode of transport.
*16:08.500- 16:13.200* :  What Japanese airports are doing about the menace of the sit-on electric suitcase?
*16:21.140- 16:25.560* :  Ryan Reynolds here for I guess my hundreds mid commercial. No, no, no, no, no,
*16:25.620- 16:29.700* :  No, you know, honestly, when I started this, I thought I'd only have to do, like, four
*16:29.700- 16:30.100* :  of these.
*16:30.380- 16:33.580* :  I mean, it's unlimited, premium wireless for $15 a month.
*16:33.680- 16:36.600* :  How are there still people paying two or three times that much?
*16:37.200- 16:38.680* :  I'm sorry, I shouldn't be victim blaming here.
*16:38.720- 16:43.140* :  Give it a try at midmobile.com slash switch, whatever you're ready.

*17:48.980- 17:54.700* :  The American received an enthusiastic welcome as she finished her routine on the beam three
*17:54.700- 17:59.480* :  years after she withdrew halfway through the Tokyo games with a condition known as the
*17:59.520- 18:00.100* :  Twisties.
*18:00.580- 18:06.680* :  In swimming, Italy's Nicolo Martenenghi won the highly anticipated men's 100 meters breaststroke
*18:06.680- 18:10.300* :  final, forcing Britain's Adam Petty into second place.
*18:10.800- 18:16.060* :  Our correspondent Paul Serra's gave us this update on Sunday's Olympic events in France,
*18:16.840- 18:18.480* :  beginning with Simone Biles.
*18:18.880- 18:24.720* :  She was absolutely sensational when you compare her performance earlier on Sunday to three
*18:24.720- 18:30.760* :  years ago in Tokyo when she was lost, I think, with this affliction they call the Twisties
*18:30.760- 18:31.580* :  in gymnastics.
*18:31.820- 18:36.540* :  It's where the athlete loses the ability to gauge where they are in the air during complex
*18:36.540- 18:42.640* :  routines and obviously that has a serious impact on potential injuries and on your confidence,
*18:42.700- 18:47.380* :  on the confidence in oneself to be able to perform at the level they've been training
*18:47.380- 18:49.240* :  to do for their entire lives.
*18:49.240- 18:54.860* :  So we saw three years ago Simone Biles, the most decorated gymnast in Olympic history,
*18:55.300- 18:59.840* :  pull out of many of the events for which she was the favourite, but then that triumphant
*18:59.840- 19:01.500* :  return in front of it.
*19:01.500- 19:05.700* :  It's a tough crowd in Paris, generally, for sport stars, particularly if you're American
*19:05.700- 19:11.000* :  or British, but the outpouring of love from the Parisian crowd, the gymnastics earlier
*19:11.000- 19:17.400* :  on Sunday, was just incredible and she rewarded every single person there with an absolutely
*19:17.400- 19:22.960* :  cute tour de force, an incredible performance that saw her qualify for four individual finals
*19:23.480- 19:29.440* :  and the all-around final with a score that would be incredibly difficult to catch for anyone
*19:29.440- 19:30.580* :  else on the planet.
*19:30.580- 19:35.160* :  So amazing, amazing scenes at the gymnastics on Sunday morning.
*19:35.500- 19:37.120* :  And what about the days other highlights?
*19:37.540- 19:42.920* :  Rafael Nadal was in action in the singles at Roland Garros, of course, 14 times a French
*19:42.920- 19:43.780* :  open champion.
*19:44.200- 19:48.740* :  It's somewhere that he knows incredibly well and he managed to beat Martin Fussovich,
*19:48.740- 19:53.960* :  the Hungarian to reach the second round in front of a crowd that he knows so well, of
*19:53.960- 19:58.200* :  course, so much success over the years for Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros in Paris.
*19:58.380- 19:59.380* :  And so what about the swimming?
*19:59.620- 20:04.160* :  Yes, well Adam Petit was hoping to become just the second man in the history of the Olympic
*20:04.160- 20:10.700* :  Games in the pool to win the same event at three consecutive Olympic Games after, of course,
*20:10.700- 20:11.820* :  the great Michael Phelps.
*20:12.080- 20:17.600* :  He was beaten by two hundredths of a second in his quest for one hundred metre breaststroke
*20:17.600- 20:17.920* :  gold.
*20:18.260- 20:22.480* :  It was Martin Engie, the Italian who took gold and Petit who shared a silver.
*20:22.720- 20:25.380* :  There has been controversy as well though.
*20:25.380- 20:32.500* :  The convicted child rapist, Stephen Vandevelder, who's part of the Dutch Beach volleyball team,
*20:32.860- 20:33.500* :  he was playing.
*20:33.500- 20:34.460* :  Tell us about the reaction.
*20:34.860- 20:39.100* :  It's a conversation that's dominated the games, the run-up to the games.
*20:39.100- 20:44.480* :  Stephen Vandevelder, a Dutch Beach volleyball player, was convicted of three counts of child
*20:46.080- 20:46.100* :  rape.
*20:46.160- 20:50.240* :  Here in the UK back in 2016 was repatriated to serve his sentence in the Netherlands
*20:50.240- 20:53.580* :  where the charge was downgraded under Dutch law.
*20:54.100- 21:01.280* :  He was met with booze around the Beach volleyball courts and there has been such a strong protest
*21:01.320- 21:07.080* :  against his inclusion in the Dutch team that one petition has reached almost a hundred
*21:07.080- 21:10.900* :  thousand signatures to disqualify Vandevelder from competing.
*21:11.460- 21:12.620* :  That was Paul Serres.
*21:12.840- 21:17.420* :  Well, meanwhile, officials in Paris say they are confident that the River Sen will be clean
*21:17.420- 21:20.540* :  enough for its first Olympic swimming event on Tuesday.
*21:20.620- 21:26.400* :  A triathlon practice swim, due to have taken place on Sunday, was cancelled after tests
*21:26.400- 21:30.880* :  showed that the Sen's water quality had fallen below acceptable standards.
*21:31.540- 21:36.520* :  Twelve days ago, the city's mayor and Idalgo swam in the river to demonstrate it was ready
*21:36.520- 21:37.260* :  for the games.
*21:37.260- 21:39.900* :  Here's our Paris correspondent Andrew Harding.
*21:40.500- 21:45.340* :  The rain that dampened Friday's Olympic opening ceremony had a knock-on effect, washing
*21:45.340- 21:47.740* :  untreated sewage into the river Sen.
*21:47.820- 21:53.520* :  But French officials insisted any pollution would be long gone by Tuesday thanks to a spell
*21:53.520- 21:57.380* :  of dry, warm weather and to a decade of hard work and investment.
*21:57.840- 22:03.160* :  Paris has spent one and a half billion euros diverting all sorts of waste pipes and building
*22:03.160- 22:08.480* :  what's been dubbed an underground cathedral, a giant reservoir under the city centre that
*22:08.480- 22:10.360* :  can hold excess rain water.
*22:10.780- 22:14.480* :  The renovations are not just for the benefit of a few triathlon athletes.
*22:14.480- 22:18.640* :  Already, the number of fish species in the Sen has risen tenfold.
*22:19.200- 22:21.700* :  Public bathing spots will open next year.
*22:22.140- 22:28.700* :  While some may remember Paris 2024 for Celine Dion or gold medals, a clean river opened
*22:28.700- 22:34.160* :  to swimmers for the first time in a century may prove to be the game's most enduring legacy.
*22:34.720- 22:35.980* :  That was Andrew Harding.
*22:36.420- 22:40.840* :  The organisers of the Paris Olympics have said they're really sorry after some Roman Catholic
*22:40.840- 22:45.920* :  groups and French bishops condemned parts of the opening ceremony as making a mockery
*22:45.920- 22:46.740* :  of Christianity.
*22:47.240- 22:53.320* :  Criticism has focused on a scene involving dancers, drag queens and a DJ, imposes similar
*22:53.320- 22:55.200* :  to depictions of the last supper.
*22:55.200- 23:00.020* :  The final meal Jesus is said to have taken with his apostles, the events spokesperson,
*23:00.020- 23:01.100* :  is Andesion.
*23:01.540- 23:08.580* :  There was never an intention to show this respect to any religious group.
*23:09.320- 23:14.700* :  If people have taken any offense, we are, of course, really, really sorry.
*23:15.140- 23:21.180* :  Andesion, now to a pastime that is not an Olympic sport, roof topping, it's the term
*23:21.180- 23:27.180* :  given to those who risk their lives by climbing extremely high buildings or structures without
*23:27.180- 23:29.620* :  safety equipment for the sake of art.
*23:30.100- 23:36.500* :  A new Netflix documentary entitled Skywalkers, a love story, focuses on two roof toppers,
*23:36.860- 23:39.660* :  Angela Nicolae and Ivan Vanya Birkus.
*23:40.120- 23:47.980* :  A highlight shows them climbing the 679 metre Medaika 118 tower in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia,
*23:48.660- 23:51.320* :  while trying to avoid being arrested and jailed.
*23:51.680- 23:57.860* :  Krupa Paddy spoke to the documentary maker's Jeff Zimbalist and Maria Buchanina and first
*23:57.860- 24:02.240* :  asked Jeff, a former roof topper, himself, to explain the concept.
*24:03.080- 24:11.460* :  Usually trespassing tends to be onto the highest roofs in the world and it takes a range of
*24:11.800- 24:12.320* :  different forms.
*24:12.320- 24:18.300* :  Some people do daredevil stunts where they hang from one arm for likes on social media
*24:18.300- 24:23.740* :  and risk their lives, which is more of the shock value approach that we were less interested
*24:23.740- 24:24.020* :  in.
*24:24.380- 24:29.680* :  And then there's people who consider themselves genuine artists like Angela Nicolae and Ivan
*24:29.680- 24:30.220* :  Birkus.
*24:30.480- 24:35.680* :  And for them, it's an opportunity to face their fears and figure out who they want to be
*24:35.680- 24:36.180* :  in the world.
*24:36.180- 24:41.620* :  And they put a lot of energy into picking out the wardrobe, picking the time of day, finding
*24:41.620- 24:46.920* :  the lighting, creating acrobatics, gymnastic poses, they're both trained in acrobatics
*24:46.920- 24:51.920* :  and gymnastics, and then flying their own drone and figuring out the right angles to get.
*24:52.360- 24:57.440* :  Maria, I think that you've moved to live and travel with a couple for a significant amount
*24:57.440- 24:59.260* :  of time for this documentary.
*24:59.260- 25:00.080* :  How is that?
*25:00.500- 25:00.900* :  I did.
*25:02.020- 25:06.640* :  You know, there was a lot of things going on with the couple and in their relationship
*25:06.640- 25:10.680* :  and their artistic pursuits and then, you know, pandemic hit.
*25:11.320- 25:16.460* :  So we weren't sure where the story would go and, you know, they weren't able to travel
*25:17.000- 25:17.660* :  for a while.
*25:17.980- 25:24.060* :  So by being there during the pandemic, where was able to kind of observe the tensions and,
*25:24.580- 25:27.780* :  you know, we didn't know, the suspense was there, we didn't know if they would ever
*25:27.940- 25:31.360* :  be able to travel again as, you know, this continued for several years.
*25:31.360- 25:33.560* :  So it was an interesting time.
*25:33.820- 25:38.420* :  You used the word tensions and they were romantic tensions as well, weren't they, Jeff?
*25:38.460- 25:41.060* :  Because this is part love story, part thriller.
*25:41.060- 25:42.780* :  Was that a hard balance to strike?
*25:43.340- 25:47.820* :  Yeah, you know, I had, like you mentioned, been a rooftop or in the late 90s, early
*25:47.820- 25:52.940* :  odds and for 15 plus years, I was looking for a story that was more substantial than
*25:52.940- 25:56.740* :  just that daredevil does stunt for likes narrative.
*25:56.780- 26:01.800* :  And it wasn't until I first talked to Angela and she introduced me to Vanya.
*26:02.760- 26:03.960* :  She introduced him at first.
*26:03.960- 26:10.820* :  This is in 2015 or 2016 as a rival or a competitor and it was under the surface that you
*26:10.820- 26:12.720* :  could sense this bubbling flirtation.
*26:13.040- 26:16.720* :  And that was the moment where this seed got planted of, oh my God, maybe we could tell
*26:16.720- 26:18.320* :  a love story on top of the world.
*26:18.800- 26:24.260* :  And immediately the puzzle pieces came together that you could use extreme climbing as a metaphor
*26:24.260- 26:25.640* :  for romantic trust.
*26:25.960- 26:29.420* :  We should also say that no one should be trying this at all and the documentary states
*26:29.420- 26:30.280* :  that a few times.
*26:31.040- 26:36.180* :  Were you worried or are you worried at any stage that this documentary glamorizes what
*26:36.180- 26:38.280* :  is a very dangerous activity?
*26:38.840- 26:43.200* :  Yeah, that's a valid concern and something that we were concerned about as well from
*26:43.200- 26:43.660* :  the beginning.
*26:43.740- 26:50.040* :  When you see this material on social media where it's existed for 15 plus years, it has
*26:50.040- 26:50.740* :  no context.
*26:50.760- 26:56.180* :  It's just a perfect polished pose at the end of, you know, often very scary and dangerous
*26:56.180- 26:56.600* :  climb.
*26:56.740- 27:01.560* :  And so if someone were to watch that on social media, they might say, oh, I could do
*27:01.560- 27:01.780* :  that.
*27:02.060- 27:03.280* :  That's accessible to any of us.
*27:03.420- 27:07.500* :  Whereas in the film, not only do we have the text up front that explains the dangers
*27:07.500- 27:13.320* :  and says that nobody should copy cat, but also you get to see deaths that have occurred
*27:13.320- 27:17.080* :  as a result of this activity, which are, you know, stomach turning.
*27:17.180- 27:21.780* :  And you see that our subjects are trained acrobats and gymnasts.
*27:22.000- 27:23.980* :  And even then they're very afraid.
*27:23.980- 27:27.260* :  Angela has multiple panic attacks in the film.
*27:27.260- 27:31.400* :  They consider quitting and retiring multiple times in the film.
*27:31.840- 27:33.580* :  And you get to see just how hard it is.
*27:33.620- 27:37.900* :  And so by the end of the film, you know, the overwhelming feedback we get from people
*27:37.900- 27:42.220* :  who watch it is, there's no way I would ever even begin to think to attempt something
*27:42.220- 27:42.780* :  like that.
*27:43.420- 27:49.020* :  That was Jeff Zimbalist and Maria Buchanina, directors of the documentary called Skywalkers
*27:49.040- 27:49.700* :  A Love Story.
*27:49.700- 27:52.160* :  And seriously, please don't try that at home.
*27:52.720- 27:58.340* :  Now a growing number of Japanese airports are banning sit-on electric suitcases because
*27:58.340- 28:00.580* :  they present a danger to other passengers.
*28:00.580- 28:06.360* :  Mickey Bristo looks at how a piece of luggage has for some turned into a motorized menace.
*28:06.780- 28:10.660* :  Electric powered luggage is a new and unusual mode of transport.
*28:11.340- 28:16.540* :  Travelers can still pack everything they need for a holiday, but it also allows them, particularly
*28:16.540- 28:20.900* :  the older ones, to navigate the sometimes long distances within airports.
*28:21.780- 28:26.300* :  Some passengers though have complained of suitcases whizzing past them at high speed.
*28:27.020- 28:32.620* :  And so one by one, Japanese airports have been banning this motorized luggage, Kansai
*28:32.620- 28:35.960* :  International Airport, Neurosaka, as become the latest.
*28:36.940- 28:41.360* :  The problems caused by electric suitcases, however, are not just limited to airports.
*28:42.200- 28:47.400* :  Last month, Japanese police pulled over a Chinese student on a street in Osaka, because
*28:47.400- 28:51.660* :  she was riding luggage with a top speed of 13 kilometres an hour.
*28:52.380- 28:58.040* :  The incident was referred to prosecutors, the first case of its kind, because under Japanese
*28:58.700- 29:04.140* :  traffic law, the suitcase was classified as a motorized bicycle, and the rider should
*29:04.140- 29:07.320* :  have had a helmet, insurance and rearview mirrors.
*29:07.980- 29:09.260* :  That was Mickey Bristo.
*29:11.500- 29:15.520* :  And that's it from us for now, I'm firing up my suitcase with a journey home, but there
*29:15.520- 29:18.180* :  will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*29:18.700- 29:22.680* :  If you'd like to comment on this edition or the topics covered in it, do please send

*30:03.160- 30:06.260* :  So who are some of the people that you'll hear about in season two?
*30:06.440- 30:09.160* :  The richest comedian ever, Jerry Seinfeld's there.

*30:13.900- 30:15.840* :  mime, that's Mutu Prada.
*30:16.000- 30:20.220* :  And the people behind some of the biggest companies on the planet, Google TikTok for example.
*30:20.460- 30:24.340* :  But we are kicking off with a sporting superstar, Tiger Woods.
