*01:39.020- 01:45.180* :  I'm Bernadette Kioh, and to 0900 GMT on Monday the 22nd of July, these are our main stories.
*01:45.980- 01:50.680* :  US Vice President Kamala Harris seeks to gain the party's presidential nomination
*01:50.680- 01:57.240* :  after Joe Biden withdraws. But can she win against Donald Trump? We hear from polling experts,
*01:57.240- 02:02.500* :  and those who've worked closely with her. And the international reaction to a future without
*02:02.500- 02:10.900* :  Mr. Biden in charge, we hear from Ukraine and Israel. Also in this podcast,
*02:10.900- 02:17.640* :  these strikes help them to gain more popularity locally, and also pitches them as the bank guards
*02:17.640- 02:22.500* :  of the Muslim, the Arab nation, because they're the only people actually fighting the Israelis in Gaza.
*02:23.300- 02:27.600* :  What might be the consequences of the drone strike on Israel by the Houthi movement in Yemen?
*02:33.100- 02:38.020* :  After Joe Biden's announcement that he was ending his campaign for re-election, many leading
*02:38.020- 02:43.580* :  Democrats in the United States have followed his lead by backing the Vice President Kamala Harris
*02:43.580- 02:49.160* :  as the party's new presidential nominee for November's election. Mr. Biden's decision,
*02:49.160- 02:54.980* :  with only 106 days to go until that poll takes place, came after weeks of concern
*02:54.980- 02:59.900* :  at the 81-year-old's full-turing performance in a televised debate opposite Donald Trump.
*03:00.360- 03:05.800* :  There were more public embarrassments as he got names mixed up, prompting calls for him to go
*03:05.800- 03:12.620* :  from Democrats and more importantly from party donors. In a post on social media, Mr. Biden
*03:12.620- 03:18.280* :  insisted he was going to stay in post as president until the election. And he also endorsed
*03:18.280- 03:23.720* :  his Vice President Kamala Harris to stand against Mr. Trump. Our North America correspondent,
*03:23.720- 03:28.220* :  David Willis, looks back at the events leading up to the decision to quit the race.
*03:28.540- 03:32.660* :  Well, this would not have been how Joe Biden would have wanted his more than 50 years
*03:32.660- 03:39.000* :  in public life to have come to an end. He'd faced a growing calls to withdraw
*03:39.780- 03:46.600* :  from the presidential race yet the decision. When it came, nonetheless, caught many people by
*03:46.600- 03:53.260* :  surprise. So, Joe Biden was at his dallowware beach house where he's been recuperating from the
*03:53.260- 04:00.500* :  effects of COVID. And reports here suggest that on Saturday evening, he called a meeting of his
*04:00.500- 04:07.640* :  senior advisors and they worked together late into the night to draft that statement, announcing
*04:07.640- 04:13.220* :  that letter, announcing that he was withdrawing as his party's presidential candidate. Now,
*04:13.220- 04:19.980* :  it wasn't until Sunday that reports suggest that Mr. Biden informed Vice President Kamala Harris
*04:20.360- 04:25.660* :  of his decision after a meeting with members of his family. A lot of White House aides
*04:26.040- 04:31.380* :  were also kept in the dark, apparently, until the very last minute. Now, in that letter,
*04:31.840- 04:37.520* :  Joe Biden says that he is withdrawing as his party's nominee for the sake of his party
*04:37.980- 04:44.960* :  and the country, but that he will continue to serve out the remainder of his term in the White House.
*04:44.960- 04:50.860* :  Now, Joe Biden, of course, originally saw himself as a one-term president, but said his
*04:50.880- 04:56.660* :  sights on a second term after he came to the belief that he was the only person in the party
*04:57.160- 05:04.420* :  who could possibly beat Donald Trump. Well, now he has endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris
*05:04.420- 05:10.180* :  in the hope that she can do that very same thing. And much now depends on whether anybody in the
*05:10.180- 05:17.100* :  party comes forward to challenge Kamala Harris. Democrats are hoping that her ascension will
*05:17.100- 05:21.940* :  energize the party and bring more of their supporters to the polls and many of them
*05:21.940- 05:28.660* :  just want to break from the last few weeks, which have seen some very ugly headlines as far
*05:28.660- 05:35.500* :  as Joe Biden is concerned. As David Willis was saying, Vice President Kamala Harris is the
*05:35.500- 05:40.920* :  front runner to be presidential candidate, but some in the Democratic party, such as Senator Peter
*05:40.920- 05:46.480* :  Welch, are calling for an open process to decide the nominee. It's really important for us as
*05:46.480- 05:51.960* :  Democrats to take advantage of the extraordinary energy that's been unleashed by the President's
*05:51.960- 05:58.800* :  decision to step aside and show that we're confident about engaging everyday Democrats to participate
*05:59.260- 06:05.280* :  in this. My view is that our nominee, in all likelihood, Vice President Harris, is going to be
*06:05.280- 06:12.160* :  strengthened by a process that's seen as open so that I think really be terrific for her to make
*06:12.640- 06:16.860* :  contact with everyday Democrats and I just remember to the Senate House and the governors.
*06:17.680- 06:23.480* :  But Amy Klebousha, the Democratic Senator from Minnesota, was among the first to endorse Kamala Harris.
*06:24.060- 06:28.560* :  Kamala Harris and I ran against each other for President. And what I learned
*06:28.560- 06:36.040* :  from that experience was that, one, she's an incredibly strong leader who will bring to this office
*06:36.040- 06:43.340* :  and to this campaign the receipts. She, along with President Biden, got our nation through this
*06:43.340- 06:50.100* :  pandemic. We've seen record job increases. She is someone that knows the work, knows the job.
*06:50.720- 06:53.160* :  And I also know her as a good person.
*06:54.000- 06:59.560* :  Cylinder Lake is a leading Democratic party pollster who's worked for Joe Biden and is also
*06:59.560- 07:05.340* :  endorsing Kamala Harris. Nick Robinson asked her what the reaction had been to President Biden
*07:05.340- 07:12.260* :  with drawing from the race. It's an exciting day on one hand and a sad day on the other and I am
*07:12.260- 07:18.000* :  very grateful to Joe Biden for his leadership and extraordinary presidency. Now, you're excited
*07:18.000- 07:23.520* :  and you already as a pollster of endorsed Kamala Harris. Despite the fact the polls don't suggest
*07:23.520- 07:27.900* :  that she's doing any better against Donald Trump than Joe Biden was doing. Well, actually,
*07:27.900- 07:32.280* :  the most recent polls do suggest she's doing better. This is the first time voters are taking
*07:32.280- 07:37.940* :  a new fresh look at her. And I think they're going to be very excited about what they see.
*07:38.100- 07:42.380* :  She's always run very strongly with women, with younger voters.
*07:42.680- 07:46.760* :  She has quite a base. She's one of the most qualified candidates to have ever had for President.
*07:46.760- 07:51.980* :  So it's very, very exciting. And yet in the rust belt, in the swing states,
*07:51.980- 07:57.980* :  amongst the very few independents that are left, she's seen as she nods as a left wing,
*07:57.980- 08:02.900* :  a progressive candidate. I don't think she's known that well period. Like any vice president to
*08:02.900- 08:07.400* :  the degree that they have an impression of her that is derived from the impression of the president.
*08:07.860- 08:12.680* :  They don't know that she is a fierce prosecutor that she's taken economic interest
*08:12.680- 08:17.180* :  paths for price gouging when she was attorney general. They're unclear about the number
*08:17.180- 08:21.000* :  of accomplishments that she's been actively a part of in terms of the administration.
*08:21.260- 08:25.240* :  And it's a new day. It's a new dawn. Democrats are going to be very excited about it.
*08:25.380- 08:31.340* :  Wouldn't they be even more excited by an open contest of the best talent the Democratic party
*08:31.340- 08:38.140* :  have got? Do you think that's why the Obama's not yet back in Kamala Harris that Senator Chuck
*08:38.140- 08:43.520* :  Schumer is not that representative Hakim Jeffries and all the key Democrats in Congress?
*08:43.520- 08:48.720* :  It's not the role of elites to pick the nominee is the role of the voters. And the voters have
*08:48.720- 08:54.240* :  already picked Harris as the nominee. No, I don't think an open process with 110 days left.
*08:54.240- 08:59.580* :  And she's been through an open process. She ran for president. She ran for vice president.
*08:59.580- 09:04.060* :  She's been vice president for three and a half years. She's been tested.
*09:04.600- 09:08.720* :  So Linda, I suspect you have Democrat donors who sometimes in private ask you
*09:09.200- 09:16.360* :  this awkward but important question. Can a woman win in America after Hillary Clinton's
*09:16.360- 09:22.820* :  experience? Can a woman of color be Donald Trump? I think that it is very tough to elect a woman
*09:22.820- 09:28.320* :  as president of the United States as we saw with Hillary Clinton. It is tough to elect a person
*09:28.320- 09:33.440* :  of color as we saw with Barack Obama. But I think it's the right person at the right time
*09:33.440- 09:40.660* :  with the right experience. There is a dramatic amount of change in the electorate that makes
*09:40.660- 09:46.000* :  this the right time the right moment for this kind of candidacy. For three and a half weeks,
*09:46.000- 09:51.580* :  we've been fighting a question about Joe Biden and his age. Now we get to litigate the case
*09:51.580- 09:57.300* :  about Donald Trump. In 2020, we won because two thirds of the voters said their vote was about
*09:57.300- 10:02.100* :  Donald Trump. If we get a majority of the voters to say their vote is about Donald Trump and not
*10:02.100- 10:07.440* :  Joe Biden's age, we're going to win this contest. So what have the Republicans made of this?
*10:07.500- 10:13.460* :  The party's nominee and former president Donald Trump reacted swiftly to the news via his social
*10:13.460- 10:20.080* :  media website, Truth Social, saying Mr Biden was not and had never been fit to serve as president.
*10:20.840- 10:25.500* :  The Republican US House Speaker, Mike Johnson, called for him to resign immediately.
*10:26.460- 10:31.160* :  So will the Republicans be happy for their candidate Donald Trump to run against Vice President
*10:31.160- 10:36.720* :  Kamala Harris or another candidate? Pete Sessions is a Republican congressman for Texas.
*10:37.420- 10:42.720* :  Michelle has saying put it to him that this makes it harder for Donald Trump to win as Kamala Harris
*10:42.720- 10:48.220* :  polls better than Joe Biden. She was his mate. This is what I'm saying. We're going to find out
*10:48.220- 10:53.580* :  what she's able to do. It's hard for me to predict she's got to decide what she's going to take
*10:53.580- 10:58.680* :  credit for. And if it's healthcare, that's great. I don't know that there have been anything that
*10:58.720- 11:03.460* :  they have done there, but well, for example, lowering, lowering prescription drug costs for seniors.
*11:03.460- 11:07.840* :  That's one of the key things that President Biden's put in essentially what is a farewell message.
*11:08.160- 11:13.440* :  Can I ask you about the man himself? Are you happy for him to continue in office until
*11:13.440- 11:18.860* :  a formal handover in January next year? I would hope that he would stay in office. I would hope
*11:18.860- 11:26.500* :  that he would complete his term. And I think the country does. We don't really need a person who
*11:26.500- 11:32.680* :  is running for president and trying to be president. That is another daunting task.
*11:32.680- 11:37.460* :  There are Republicans who are saying if President Biden isn't fit enough to run again,
*11:37.460- 11:42.860* :  then he should stand down now. I don't think believe any Republican would hold that view.
*11:43.120- 11:48.660* :  I think that it would be quite the opposite. Mike Johnson said that. Well, Mike Johnson does not
*11:48.660- 11:53.100* :  know what he's talking about then. Why do you say that? Why do you say that about President Biden
*11:53.100- 11:58.700* :  rather than about Mike Johnson? For one thing, it is up to them to make a determination what
*11:58.700- 12:05.960* :  they do. And while we're entitled to have an opinion, we need to have a cohesive opportunity
*12:05.960- 12:12.100* :  for her to go put her campaign together to focus on that and then running the country as a different
*12:12.120- 12:17.260* :  matter. JD has things this too, you know, I just disagree with both of them then. Let me put
*12:17.260- 12:22.760* :  to exactly the way that JD Vans put it that Biden's decision to not run for re-election is a clear
*12:22.760- 12:27.580* :  admission that President Trump was right all along about Biden not being mentally fit enough
*12:28.240- 12:32.940* :  to serve as Commander-in-Chief. You're confident that he is mentally fit enough to be Commander
*12:32.940- 12:39.220* : -in-Chief till January. That is not my point. My point is that I believe that Kamala Harris
*12:39.220- 12:46.040* :  in running for denomination. First, she has to run for a nomination for another 45 days.
*12:46.040- 12:51.620* :  Then when you secure the nomination, then you have to run for president. I don't think it's a
*12:51.620- 13:00.780* :  slam dunk issue that Kamala Harris is necessarily going to have the support of the Democratic Party.
*13:00.860- 13:06.560* :  There may be an open convention that would be in a month. There could be a lot of things,
*13:06.660- 13:12.880* :  and I don't think that that's a good task for her to take on being president and doing that.
*13:13.940- 13:18.940* :  Well, Mr. Biden was quick to nominate his number two, Kamala Harris, to step out of his shadow
*13:18.940- 13:25.040* :  and run for president. Bill and Hillary Clinton, as well as many Democrat donors, are also rallying
*13:25.040- 13:30.640* :  behind her. And she's often praised for her work as a prosecutor and the power of her personal
*13:30.640- 13:37.340* :  story. But it's fair to say not everyone is convinced. Kamala Harris' opinion poll ratings have
*13:37.340- 13:42.460* :  been consistently low, and her critics cite her frequently awkward public appearances.
*13:43.480- 13:48.040* :  Gil Durran was her communications director when she was California's attorney general,
*13:48.040- 13:53.760* :  and has written about her problems retaining and motivating staff. He's been speaking to Nick
*13:53.760- 13:59.440* :  Robinson. I think the strength of Kamala Harris is that she's had a meteoric rise in politics,
*13:59.440- 14:07.060* :  and many people see her as an important symbol of the progress that is possible in America and
*14:07.060- 14:13.780* :  a sign that we're moving into a future where women, where people of color, where California has a
*14:13.780- 14:19.920* :  central role in the politics of the nation. And I think she's really captured the hopes and the
*14:19.920- 14:26.840* :  aspiration of millions of Americans in a way that has taken her from the district attorney's
*14:26.840- 14:31.720* :  office in San Francisco all the way to the White House. Along the way, there have been some bumps.
*14:31.720- 14:37.300* :  She ran a pretty terrible 2020 campaign and dropped out before the primaries. She said some
*14:37.300- 14:44.360* :  issues keeping staff or articulating clearly her values and her positions in interviews and in
*14:44.360- 14:50.780* :  other formats where that's important to communicate strongly. You know her, you've worked with her.
*14:51.540- 14:56.840* :  Do you think, first of all, that she is ready to be the president as against to be the candidate,
*14:56.840- 15:01.960* :  which is a slightly different question? I look at it this way. If Donald Trump can be the president
*15:01.960- 15:06.560* :  of the United States, anybody can be ready to be the president. So I don't think that's a question.
*15:06.620- 15:10.520* :  I think that the people around Harris are very much the people who've been in the Biden
*15:10.520- 15:16.280* :  Harris team so far. I think this is a question about whether we keep the office of the presidency
*15:16.280- 15:21.940* :  in the hands of the Democratic Party and those who will leave in its values or whether we shift
*15:21.940- 15:27.320* :  to a more aggressive and aggrieved and dangerous Donald Trump who is promised to make some pretty
*15:27.320- 15:34.560* :  dramatic changes that might remake our government in a less democratic form. So I do think that's
*15:34.560- 15:40.100* :  not the most full-throated endorsement is it? You're saying she's not Trump and therefore better
*15:40.760- 15:45.240* :  rather than she be a great president. Well, I think she has the potential to be a great president.
*15:45.240- 15:50.940* :  Like I said earlier, she's captured the hopes and the aspirations of a lot of Americans.
*15:51.020- 15:56.200* :  Right now we're going to find out what she's made of. A part of the problem, part of the reason
*15:56.200- 16:02.180* :  for your criticism is she's not a great communicator in some ways. She has stumbled in campaigns,
*16:02.180- 16:08.160* :  not least on the most important issue she was asked to deal with and the one that Trump believes
*16:08.160- 16:14.620* :  is an election winner, illegal migration. Undocumented immigrants and the immigration across the border
*16:14.620- 16:20.020* :  is a problem that has vexed every American president for the past, I don't know, 50, 60 years or
*16:20.020- 16:24.380* :  longer. But it is a political football and one where the Republicans tend to have an advantage
*16:24.820- 16:29.600* :  because they can speak in very strong terms about being very aggressive and shutting down the
*16:29.600- 16:35.700* :  border, which never actually manages to happen. But I think that Kamala can speak to those issues
*16:35.700- 16:42.300* :  in a way that is less aggressive and more in line with democratic values here. You referred to
*16:42.300- 16:48.420* :  difficulties retaining staff. What is the problem with her management? Well, I think like a lot of
*16:48.420- 16:52.540* :  people in politics, she can be a bit harsh on her staff. And certainly I'm not the only person
*16:52.540- 16:59.020* :  to say that. Well, I will say over the past year, there has been a different narrative coming out
*16:59.020- 17:03.640* :  of the office. There's been some stability. But I also note that Trump doesn't have a very great
*17:04.120- 17:08.140* :  track record of staff. In fact, he has several staffers who have now gone to prison, including
*17:08.140- 17:13.720* :  Steve Bannon, who's sitting in prison right now. Should the party unite behind her or should they
*17:13.720- 17:19.280* :  look for alternatives as well? I think the party is going to have to unite. In fact, I would say the
*17:19.280- 17:25.620* :  bigger problem right now is whether the democratic party can find a way to unite behind the candidate
*17:25.960- 17:30.980* :  in the way that the Republican party is united behind Donald Trump. I think the Democrats, if they
*17:30.980- 17:35.140* :  are, if they think they're picking from an endless menu of candidates and that there's some perfect
*17:35.140- 17:39.300* :  candidate out there, I think that the cause will be lost. There's not going to be a perfect candidate.
*17:39.700- 17:43.940* :  There's not going to be somebody who pulls 20 points ahead of Trump. And I think Kamala Harris is
*17:43.940- 17:49.660* :  in the best position to inherit the mantle of Biden. And if we keep throwing it open and creating
*17:49.660- 17:54.740* :  more chaos, I think the Democrats are going to be the party of chaos, which would be a strange
*17:54.740- 18:00.520* :  accomplishment given that they're up against Donald Trump. In international reaction to Joe Biden's
*18:00.520- 18:06.280* :  decision to quit the presidential race, President Zelensky of Ukraine expressed gratitude for what
*18:06.280- 18:12.480* :  he described as Mr. Biden's bold steps in supporting his country. His words were echoed by the
*18:12.480- 18:19.840* :  Ukrainian MP Alexei Contrenko in an interview with the BBC's Sana Safi. So it was not just Biden
*18:20.720- 18:24.620* :  administration was, which was really very supportive and we are thankful for this, but Biden
*18:24.620- 18:34.360* :  Harris administration. So if it will become all a Harris, it's more or less clear what politics
*18:34.360- 18:40.580* :  will continue. If it will be another candidate, that's another story hard to predict. But we hope
*18:40.580- 18:45.940* :  that whoever will become the president of the United States to support Ukraine today, it's not
*18:45.940- 18:51.200* :  about Ukraine. It's in the best national interest of the United States. The way we were supported
*18:51.200- 18:57.560* :  during the last two and a half years, we were supported just enough to survive, not to lose,
*18:57.940- 19:04.000* :  unfortunately not enough to win. And I hope that will change and whoever will become the president
*19:04.060- 19:10.040* :  they will make final decisions, which will give us opportunity to win and to end this war in
*19:10.040- 19:16.380* :  the favor of not Ukraine, but of our values to protect this values to restore international law.
*19:16.740- 19:21.740* :  And if the winner of the election is Donald Trump, as you know, he promised to put a stop to the
*19:21.740- 19:27.960* :  war with Russia, what challenges are you anticipating and expecting? The story we about President
*19:27.960- 19:33.140* :  Trump is that he's unpredictable. So he can be very bad, he can be very good, I mean, for Ukraine.
*19:33.140- 19:38.140* :  What I do know that the President Trump was the first US president to support Ukraine by weapons.
*19:39.260- 19:44.440* :  Russia wasn't quite so forthcoming in its reaction. A Kremlin spokesman said the so-called
*19:44.440- 19:49.600* :  military operation in Ukraine was still the main priority, and the election in the US was still
*19:49.600- 19:54.860* :  four months away, so a lot could change. In another area of current conflict, the Israeli
*19:54.860- 19:59.920* :  Defence Minister thanked Mr Biden for what he called his unwavering support over the years,
*19:59.920- 20:06.140* :  which he described as invaluable. And this is what the veteran Israeli politician Yossi Baleen
*20:06.140- 20:13.640* :  had to say. He was a staunch friend of us. I mean, I'm not known him for 38 years, and I don't know
*20:13.640- 20:21.840* :  many other foreign leaders or such friends of Israel and close to Israel. Sometimes, of course,
*20:21.840- 20:29.820* :  criticizing the governments during all these years, but he always separated between
*20:29.900- 20:41.220* :  policy of governments and the Israel as a beacon of democracy in the region, and as an ally,
*20:42.420- 20:45.080* :  ideological ally of the United States.
*20:49.640- 20:56.040* :  Still to come, these are serial killers. You're stepping out the line now. Never have I been proven
*20:56.040- 21:02.580* :  by court a serial killer. The BBC confronts a convicted South African murderer who killed dozens
*21:02.580- 21:04.520* :  of black men during apartheid.
*21:13.640- 21:19.420* :  Ryan Reynolds here for, I guess, my hundreds mid commercial. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
*21:19.420- 21:22.620* :  no. You know, honestly, when I started this, I thought I'd only have to do like four of these.

*22:18.240- 22:23.160* :  A new report by the Medical Charity Meds and Some Frontier has detailed horrific violence
*22:23.160- 22:28.660* :  in the ongoing civil conflict in Sudan, including repeated attacks on hospitals and clinics.
*22:28.700- 22:32.480* :  The report has been published following a week of indirect talks,
*22:32.480- 22:36.560* :  broken by the UN in Geneva, between Sudan's warring sides.
*22:37.320- 22:43.920* :  Imagine folks as this report. MSF is one of the few international aid agencies still operating
*22:43.920- 22:51.480* :  across Sudan. It's report details harrowing violence, with medical workers describing days in
*22:51.480- 22:57.120* :  which dozens of people arrive at hospital, all of them missing limbs following an air strike.
*22:57.180- 23:04.100* :  Hospitals, markets and homes have been destroyed. MSF says children already badly injured
*23:04.100- 23:09.460* :  have been killed because the emergency ward they were being treated in was bombed,
*23:09.940- 23:17.060* :  and sexual violence is rife. MSF teams treating survivors of sexual violence in refugee camps
*23:17.060- 23:24.940* :  found 40 percent reported being raped by multiple attackers. Sudan has become the world's largest
*23:24.940- 23:32.340* :  displacement crisis. 11 million people have been forced to flee. The UN fears three-quarters
*23:32.340- 23:38.760* :  of a million now face famine. In Geneva last week, the UN brokered talks with the warring
*23:38.760- 23:46.440* :  sides aimed at increasing the flow of aid. MSF describes systemic obstacles faced by aid
*23:46.440- 23:50.640* :  agencies. The talks ended with no clear progress.
*23:52.040- 23:57.860* :  Israel and the Houthi movement in Yemen exchanged missile attacks over the weekend. On Saturday,
*23:57.860- 24:04.080* :  Israel hit the port city of Hidada, which is controlled by the Houthi movement, causing huge fires
*24:04.080- 24:09.400* :  at a fuel terminal. This was in retaliation for a drone launched by the Houthis on Israel,
*24:09.400- 24:15.720* :  which hit Tel Aviv. So how much damage was done in Hidada, and where might this escalation be
*24:15.720- 24:21.660* :  leading? Hisham Alamazi is a senior Yemen analyst for the European Institute of Peace.
*24:22.340- 24:27.280* :  Relatively speaking, it's not as bad as, for instance, over the past 10 years for the Saudi-led
*24:27.280- 24:33.260* :  coalition of air strikes, but we've witnessed a period of calm over the past two years.
*24:33.720- 24:39.880* :  So this is actually the first major strike in this current period. Also, this is the first
*24:39.880- 24:45.960* :  Israeli-Eastrike on Yemen, leading to widespread condemnation, not just from the Houthis,
*24:46.340- 24:51.080* :  but across the political spectrum in Yemen, and also regionally, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
*24:51.080- 25:00.300* :  Oman. In fact, the Houthi leader was on TV just a few hours ago, saying this basically marks the
*25:00.300- 25:06.460* :  start of the fifth state of the escalation. And he promised more devastating
*25:06.460- 25:13.180* :  airstrikes against Israel, and they basically also said there are no red lines, meaning
*25:13.260- 25:20.080* :  that they're also target civilian locations inside Israel. The Houthis have regional ambitions,
*25:21.040- 25:27.620* :  and also local ambitions. These strikes, of course, are pitched as being in support of the Palestinian
*25:27.620- 25:35.340* :  Zingaza, but the Houthis also have their own goals. They want to strengthen their grip locally
*25:35.340- 25:42.880* :  in Yemen. These strikes help them to gain more popularity locally, and also pitches them
*25:42.880- 25:47.180* :  as the bank guards or the Muslim, the Arab nation, because they're the only people actually
*25:47.180- 25:52.360* :  fighting the Israelis in Gaza. Well, that's the image they want to propagate. But also,
*25:52.360- 25:58.480* :  it serves their expansionist agenda. The Houthis want to control Yemen, but they're setting their
*25:58.480- 26:03.860* :  eyes on the region at large. They have regional players backing them. In fact,
*26:03.860- 26:09.260* :  the Houthis have managed over the past few months to forge new partnerships with the Iraqi
*26:09.260- 26:14.860* :  resistance, with Hassanullah, and you're going to be seeing an increase of these partnerships in the
*26:14.860- 26:21.080* :  region. It's tense on the streets of Bangladesh. Armed police and soldiers are out in force,
*26:21.080- 26:27.340* :  as student protesters, furious about government job quotas, continue demonstrations, even after
*26:27.340- 26:34.500* :  the country's supreme court largely backed their demands. Dozens have died so far. Yuki Telemayi
*26:34.520- 26:40.880* :  is following developments. So these actually started as protests at one single university in
*26:40.880- 26:46.480* :  Dhaka, and then the Prime Minister made comments about the protests, which many protesters
*26:47.160- 26:53.620* :  say were derogatory, the protests then spread around the country, and then you had accusations.
*26:53.780- 26:59.200* :  And when it really became intense, was at the middle of last week, when two of the students were
*26:59.200- 27:05.340* :  killed. Protesters and human rights groups say the police and paramilitary brutally cracked down.
*27:06.000- 27:09.880* :  On the protests, the Bangladesh government denies that charge, but that's when it's really
*27:09.880- 27:16.060* :  spread. And at the moment, what we're hearing from Bangladesh, the AFB news agency reporting that
*27:16.060- 27:22.100* :  more than 150 people were killed. It's really difficult, let me add, to get any information out
*27:22.100- 27:27.620* :  of Bangladesh at the moment. Internet is completely shut down, and even regular phone calls and
*27:27.620- 27:32.680* :  text messages, extremely patchy, we're finding it really difficult to speak to people on the ground.
*27:32.680- 27:36.880* :  What we know is that students are saying that until the government officially
*27:36.880- 27:41.880* :  implements the supreme court's order, their demands would not have been met. But what they're
*27:41.880- 27:47.780* :  also demanding now is that the people who killed protesters, that those people, be brought to
*27:47.780- 27:53.460* :  justice as well. And why are they still demonstrating? Well, because there is now widespread
*27:53.460- 27:58.720* :  anger about how the government has handled these protests. There are a lot of videos that we've
*27:58.720- 28:05.420* :  seen on social media, some of which the BBC has verified, which seem to show security forces
*28:06.520- 28:13.540* :  using live guns, using bullets against protesters. We've heard the UN Human Rights Chief say that
*28:13.540- 28:20.420* :  the attacks on student protesters are shocking and unacceptable. We've heard from people in
*28:20.420- 28:24.780* :  Bangladesh, the few people that we've been able to contact, who say that while this is not a
*28:24.780- 28:29.280* :  country that's stranger to protests or violence, what they've seen on the ground this time around
*28:29.280- 28:35.100* :  is unlike what they've seen before. The Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, who's now been, you know,
*28:35.100- 28:41.500* :  15 consecutive years in power as Prime Minister, she's increasingly been accused of authoritarian rule
*28:41.500- 28:48.060* :  of jailing critics, of jailing journalists. It's a charge she denies, but this is perhaps one of
*28:48.060- 28:54.980* :  the biggest challenges she's faced in that tenure. A part eight ended in South Africa 30 years ago,
*28:54.980- 29:01.500* :  but many of the victims of the crimes of that era are still waiting for justice. For BBC Africa I,
*29:01.500- 29:07.200* :  the journalist, Isa Jacobson, tracked down one of the country's most prolific serial killers,
*29:07.200- 29:13.620* :  Louis Van Schuhr, who shot dead dozens of black men and boys in the late 80s, but was
*29:13.620- 29:20.860* :  controversially released from prison. All the people that are shot were black. That's not because
*29:20.860- 29:28.560* :  of race, it was because of crime. That is the voice of Louis Van Schuhr. In 1991 he was charged with
*29:28.560- 29:36.940* :  19 murders committed between 1986 and 1989. He was convicted of seven. All of his victims were
*29:36.940- 29:42.440* :  black men and boys. These murders took place while Van Schuhr was on duty as a security guard
*29:42.440- 29:49.480* :  for white businesses in East London, South Africa. He served 12 years in prison. I used the semi-automatic
*29:49.480- 29:57.320* :  9mm pistol. I used maximum force. They were justifiable oversight. And that's a bottom line.
*29:58.040- 30:03.400* :  It's a bottom line which makes Louis Van Schuhr one of South Africa's most prolific serial killers.
*30:03.780- 30:08.660* :  Almost two decades after his release from prison, he's agreed to speak with the BBC.
*30:09.680- 30:16.360* :  This shop here on the corner was art spot. I shot nothing two guys there. The alarm went off
*30:16.360- 30:21.920* :  at that factory shop. I'd never drive straight up and stop in front of the shop. I'd stop two or three
*30:21.920- 30:29.740* :  businesses away with night binoculars and then walk down. I normally work barefoot, quiet,
*30:30.420- 30:35.920* :  sort of get that feeling that, yes, hunting at a different species.
*30:37.540- 30:44.100* :  One of Van Schuhr's victims was Edward Sunnis. In 1987, Edward didn't come home. His
*30:44.100- 30:49.620* :  family searched for him late nowhere. Two years later, they learned that he was murdered and
*30:49.620- 30:56.880* :  that Van Schuhr was the main suspect in a newspaper. The police had Edward buried in an unmarked grey.
*30:59.380- 31:03.980* :  I think if I bring my dad's bones home, his spirit will dance again.
*31:05.500- 31:12.780* :  He's not happy where he is now. That's Edward Sun, Raymond. He wants to give his father
*31:12.780- 31:17.780* :  a proper burial and today his father's remains are finally being exhumed.
*31:20.200- 31:26.360* :  A checkered shirt is exposed from the earth. It's a shirt Edward's sister, Marlene, recognises.
*31:31.000- 31:34.640* :  I go to meet Van Schuhr for the last time to confront him about these murders.
*31:34.920- 31:39.460* :  I start by showing him a picture of one of his victims. It's a horusho.
*31:40.720- 31:46.220* :  It's a what? Horusho. It's a bloodboth. This is a 12-year-old.
*31:48.340- 31:52.760* :  Yeah, well, he looks much different lying there. What he was at night.
*31:53.340- 31:58.740* :  You remember describing to a journalist that you had shot over a hundred people?
*31:59.180- 32:05.520* :  Never came out of my mouth. You are a serial killer. You know, these are serial killers.
*32:05.640- 32:10.840* :  You're just stepping out the line now. Never have I been proven by court a serial killer.
*32:11.360- 32:17.080* :  I don't feel guilty about it. If you or anybody else wants to say that I'm wrong, it's your
*32:17.080- 32:21.840* :  prerovative. The families of Van Schuhr's victims may never get closure from him,
*32:22.180- 32:25.180* :  but a sense of peace can come from elsewhere.
*32:29.700- 32:34.820* :  Today I bury my father after 35 years. I bring him home today.
*32:38.300- 32:44.760* :  Everybody in the family is with them now. He is free and also I'm free now.
*32:47.420- 32:52.860* :  Raymond Sunnis speaking to Issa Jacobson.
*32:54.280- 32:58.840* :  Now returning to our top story, Joe Biden dropping out of the race to run for president
*32:59.260- 33:03.520* :  almost certainly bringing his political career of over 50 years to an end.
*33:04.200- 33:09.020* :  For many weeks it seemed he was determined to stay on, despite public expressions of doubt
*33:09.020- 33:12.940* :  from his closest friends and allies that may have been personally devastating.
*33:13.840- 33:17.300* :  So what prompted the final decision and where next for the party?
*33:18.000- 33:21.940* :  Our North America editor, Sarah Smith, has been speaking to Michelle Hussain.
*33:22.540- 33:25.820* :  Here's of course at his beach house at Rohobath Beach in Delaware,
*33:26.480- 33:30.740* :  isolating still since he was diagnosed with COVID earlier last week,
*33:30.740- 33:35.400* :  but he's summoned a very small number of his closest advisors around him.
*33:35.900- 33:40.400* :  He couldn't ignore the growing calls from more and more senior Democrats from to step aside,
*33:40.400- 33:44.740* :  but they were also looking at some new private polling data within the Democratic party.
*33:44.740- 33:48.620* :  It clearly showed that things were not moving in Joe Biden's direction,
*33:48.620- 33:54.320* :  and that it was time to step aside not just to protect his dignity and his legacy,
*33:54.840- 33:59.520* :  but also if the main goal for the Democrats is to try to defeat Donald Trump in November,
*34:00.360- 34:03.840* :  finally realised he was no longer the candidate most likely to do that.
*34:03.960- 34:07.900* :  And then this very swift process of coalescing around Kamla Harris,
*34:07.900- 34:10.540* :  which seems to be underway, coalescing if not anointing,
*34:10.900- 34:15.560* :  is that because they have polling data on her that shows her in a very different position?
*34:15.560- 34:22.640* :  Or is that about, as you said, legacy that it's the way to safeguard his record in the last three and a half years?
*34:22.960- 34:26.460* :  Well, certainly she could run on that record and say that she was part of the administration
*34:26.460- 34:31.580* :  who have achieved a fair amount, but I think it's a nervousness within the Democratic party
*34:31.580- 34:37.000* :  about having what could be a messy process if people were to fight it out for
*34:37.000- 34:42.280* :  becoming the next candidate. They've only got four weeks until the Democratic National Convention
*34:42.280- 34:46.800* :  in Chicago. They have to have the process sorted out by the 19th of August.
*34:47.500- 34:53.740* :  There was a possibility that you could enthuse and excite voters by having several very experienced,
*34:53.740- 34:58.580* :  very talented candidates, fight it out amongst themselves at the convention as delegates voted
*34:58.580- 35:04.280* :  for their favourite candidate. But the party, I think, has clearly decided that uniting around one
*35:04.280- 35:08.220* :  candidate, and if you were going to do that, it pretty much had to be the Vice President Kamala Harris,
*35:08.620- 35:14.440* :  is the safer way forward because it looks very coordinated. The huge numbers of people who are
*35:14.440- 35:19.520* :  coming out and offering their backing to Kamala Harris very, very quickly after Joe Biden had
*35:19.520- 35:23.300* :  announced he wasn't running again. Does it look like she can beat Trump? What is her polling?
*35:23.540- 35:28.700* :  Like her polling to this point is slightly better than Joe Biden's in the public polls that we
*35:28.700- 35:33.340* :  have seen, but still a little bit behind Donald Trump either nationally and also what really
*35:33.340- 35:39.160* :  matters in the 607, absolutely key swing states that will make the difference. But Democratic
*35:39.160- 35:44.340* :  operators would argue that's before she's launched a campaign. She's been a fairly anonymous
*35:44.880- 35:48.900* :  behind-the-scenes Vice President that may count against her to a certain extent. But
*35:49.700- 35:55.400* :  if she has millions of dollars behind her and a national stage in which to put together a campaign,
*35:55.400- 36:00.200* :  which presumably she has been thinking about for a number of weeks now, it's possible that she
*36:00.200- 36:05.660* :  could grab the attention as a younger, fresher, more exciting candidate and change people's minds.
*36:06.200- 36:10.900* :  And maybe the other people who could have challenged her for it, the governor of Michigan Gretchen
*36:10.900- 36:15.240* :  Whitmer, the governor of California Gavin Newsom, Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania,
*36:15.720- 36:19.140* :  they've all put their weight behind her. They're clearly not going to challenge her for it.
*36:20.060- 36:24.680* :  And if you want more on what Joe Biden's withdrawal means for Vice President Kamala Harris,
*36:24.680- 36:29.840* :  for the Democrats more broadly and for Donald Trump, you can listen to the latest episode of
*36:29.840- 36:34.640* :  the Global Story Podcast. It looks at why Mr Biden decided to quit the race
*36:35.000- 36:40.560* :  and whether Kamala Harris can unite the party. Just look for the Global Story wherever you get your
