*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:23.340- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.340- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*00:30.740- 00:32.320* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.

*00:50.040- 00:51.560* :  Handing, literally handing.
*00:52.160- 00:53.180* :  He was a killer.

*01:04.680- 01:09.640* :  This is a special edition of the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:12.580- 01:13.380* :  I'm Janet Joliel.
*01:13.380- 01:16.420* :  It's 20 hours GMT on Sunday the 21st of July.
*01:16.540- 01:22.960* :  The US President Joe Biden has announced he's ending his bid for a second term in the White House.
*01:23.620- 01:26.020* :  He's endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris,
*01:26.020- 01:28.440* :  to oppose Donald Trump in November.
*01:28.860- 01:31.640* :  We'll get reaction from Democrats and Republicans.
*01:31.640- 01:34.600* :  Joe Biden ultimately has made his decision.
*01:35.200- 01:36.840* :  And I think that at this point,
*01:37.300- 01:42.480* :  we are set up to select a ticket that is going to be victorious.
*01:43.300- 01:44.720* :  Look what he's done to our country,
*01:45.220- 01:47.820* :  with millions of people coming across our border,
*01:48.560- 01:50.260* :  totally unchecked and unvetted,
*01:50.260- 01:52.980* :  many from prisons, mental institutions,
*01:52.980- 01:55.080* :  and record numbers of terrorists.
*01:56.040- 01:58.820* :  And we'll also be getting analysis from our correspondence.
*02:03.800- 02:08.660* :  President Joe Biden has announced that he will no longer stand for re-election in November,
*02:09.020- 02:12.260* :  bowing to weeks of intense pressure from fellow Democrats
*02:12.900- 02:15.820* :  after a faltering debate performance against Donald Trump.
*02:15.820- 02:19.600* :  Mr. Biden, who's currently isolating while recovering from COVID,
*02:19.940- 02:21.960* :  posted his announcement on social media,
*02:22.460- 02:24.160* :  which is read for us by a producer.
*02:25.240- 02:28.020* :  It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president.
*02:28.900- 02:31.400* :  And while it has been my intention to seek re-election,
*02:32.220- 02:36.860* :  I believe it is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down
*02:36.940- 02:41.780* :  and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.
*02:42.940- 02:46.880* :  I will speak to the nation later this week in more detail about my decision.
*02:47.760- 02:54.540* :  For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me re-elected.
*02:55.360- 03:00.420* :  I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work.
*03:01.340- 03:05.640* :  And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people
*03:05.660- 03:08.680* :  for the faith and trust you have placed in me.
*03:09.660- 03:11.820* :  I believe today what I always have,
*03:12.440- 03:16.200* :  that there is nothing America can't do when we do it together.
*03:17.280- 03:21.020* :  We just have to remember we are the United States of America.
*03:21.700- 03:24.800* :  Mr Biden then endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris
*03:24.800- 03:27.420* :  to be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee
*03:27.420- 03:30.760* :  and urged his supporters to donate to her campaign.
*03:31.600- 03:33.840* :  Minutes after the news broke, I spoke to our correspondent,
*03:33.840- 03:37.840* :  Gary O'Donohue, who's in Michigan for Saturday night's triumphant Trump rally.
*03:38.680- 03:42.060* :  It's a really seismic moment, I think, for the country.
*03:42.060- 03:44.420* :  This pressure, as you say, has been growing,
*03:44.480- 03:47.140* :  particularly since that debate, three and a half weeks ago,
*03:47.140- 03:50.880* :  where he had this faltering, stumbling appearance,
*03:50.880- 03:55.220* :  not really seeming to be aware at times of where he was or what he was saying.
*03:55.880- 03:59.800* :  And really since then, we've had a constant drip, drip of criticism
*03:59.800- 04:01.500* :  within his own party.
*04:02.060- 04:06.980* :  Around three dozen members of Congress coming out and calling for him to step aside.
*04:06.980- 04:09.920* :  Now, this must have been a hugely difficult decision.
*04:10.820- 04:13.620* :  As recently as about two or three hours ago,
*04:13.620- 04:20.800* :  his campaign people were pushing back against yet another former Democrat independent Senator Joe Manchin,
*04:20.800- 04:23.280* :  who said this morning that he should hand over the baton.
*04:23.280- 04:26.300* :  They were pushing back against that just this morning.
*04:26.900- 04:29.900* :  And yet here we have now this letter, in a sense,
*04:30.800- 04:32.540* :  bowing to the inevitable perhaps,
*04:34.000- 04:37.700* :  talking in broad brush terms about why he's chosen to do it.
*04:37.700- 04:40.300* :  The best interests of his party and his country.
*04:40.620- 04:43.720* :  I had to say, it's come as a bit of a bolt out of the blue,
*04:43.720- 04:46.840* :  because as you say, it had seemed that he was digging in,
*04:47.200- 04:49.680* :  that his campaign were making these comments
*04:49.680- 04:51.700* :  that he was determined to say in the race.
*04:52.340- 04:57.680* :  So it seems that perhaps as he was isolating at his beach house
*04:58.120- 05:03.260* :  after contracting COVID, he may finally have had a rapid change of heart.
*05:04.280- 05:06.640* :  Well, really, the last time we saw him in public,
*05:06.640- 05:11.320* :  I think was Wednesday, where there were some uncomfortable pictures of him
*05:11.960- 05:13.820* :  on the steps of Air Force One.
*05:13.820- 05:16.180* :  He was obviously suffering from COVID.
*05:16.500- 05:19.900* :  His docs that said just a couple of days ago that he was recovering,
*05:19.900- 05:22.420* :  he was still a bit horse, had a bit of a cough,
*05:22.460- 05:25.060* :  but things were going in the right direction.
*05:26.160- 05:29.720* :  But clearly, there's been some time for reflection over the last couple of days
*05:29.720- 05:33.580* :  while he's been isolating, no doubt talking to family members,
*05:33.580- 05:36.280* :  no doubt listening to the campaign aids,
*05:36.800- 05:40.860* :  no doubt talking about those polls, which he has often pointed to.
*05:41.460- 05:44.940* :  And I can tell you, as someone who's in a swing state now, Michigan,
*05:45.620- 05:49.640* :  you know, he is starting to lag behind in these key swing states.
*05:50.100- 05:53.240* :  It's a two or three-point margin with Donald Trump at the moment,
*05:53.780- 05:55.900* :  so potentially within the margin of error.
*05:55.900- 05:59.800* :  But the Democrats cannot afford to lose places like Michigan,
*06:00.300- 06:01.940* :  like Pennsylvania, like Wisconsin,
*06:01.960- 06:06.120* :  because if they lose those places, then they lose the White House.
*06:06.500- 06:10.600* :  The other thing to say is that one of the things that's been coming out of Congress,
*06:10.600- 06:13.380* :  in particular, some of those big congressional leaders,
*06:13.860- 06:17.620* :  is warnings to Joe Biden that not only does he risk losing the White House,
*06:18.100- 06:22.480* :  but he could be a potential drag on them in Congress.
*06:22.480- 06:26.360* :  So they are very hopeful about retaking the House of Representatives,
*06:26.360- 06:30.360* :  which Republicans currently hold with a very small number of seats,
*06:30.420- 06:31.360* :  a handful of seats.
*06:31.920- 06:36.240* :  They believe, or some of them believe that Joe Biden was going to prevent them doing that.
*06:36.240- 06:38.560* :  They've got some tough races in the Senate.
*06:38.560- 06:41.100* :  It's not a good map for the Democrats this year,
*06:41.520- 06:42.780* :  in terms of those Senate races.
*06:43.140- 06:44.600* :  They want to try and hold onto that.
*06:45.000- 06:49.360* :  And of course, for the party, if they were to lose the White House
*06:49.360- 06:53.760* :  and both houses in Congress, then you've got what's called a tri-factor.
*06:54.180- 06:56.640* :  And really, with a Republican president, potentially,
*06:57.020- 07:00.040* :  and two Republican branches in Congress,
*07:00.800- 07:04.740* :  then the way is open to really push through a hard-line agenda.
*07:04.740- 07:08.940* :  So that's been one of the major concerns of people in the Democratic Party,
*07:08.940- 07:10.320* :  particularly on Capitol Hill.
*07:10.780- 07:13.420* :  But what may have also swayed him was immediate coverage.
*07:13.500- 07:19.640* :  The images showing Donald Trump looking defiant after that assassination attempt
*07:19.640- 07:24.240* :  with that triumphant rally yesterday in Michigan where you are.
*07:24.740- 07:29.700* :  And, meanwhile, Mr. Biden, not being able to go on the campaign trail,
*07:30.180- 07:33.980* :  having to isolate, this was something that even he could see,
*07:33.980- 07:36.080* :  perhaps, was not the message he wanted to send,
*07:36.080- 07:38.760* :  not the image he wanted to send to American voters
*07:38.760- 07:40.960* :  who were already concerned about his age,
*07:41.240- 07:44.860* :  given the fact that he is the oldest U.S. president ever.
*07:45.980- 07:46.640* :  Yeah, he's 81.
*07:47.240- 07:48.700* :  He's the oldest, as you rightly so.
*07:49.260- 07:52.540* :  That rally, I was at last night, the Donald Trump rally.
*07:52.920- 07:55.740* :  And there was a sort of a sense of vigor, a sense of energy,
*07:55.740- 07:58.960* :  even though, you know, he's 78 years old, he is not a young man.
*07:59.640- 08:06.420* :  But the events of last weekend energize that he's got a very young senator now
*08:06.420- 08:08.280* :  on the ticket, JD Vance from Ohio,
*08:08.820- 08:11.680* :  who should help him in some of these rust belt states as well,
*08:12.220- 08:16.380* :  where he won in 2016, and which won in the presidency in 2016.
*08:17.440- 08:22.040* :  And yes, the contrast, in fact, just moments before I came on air to talk to you,
*08:22.040- 08:24.700* :  I was writing a piece that was going to go out in a couple of hours.
*08:25.340- 08:29.860* :  And I had some pictures in this television piece of the rally last night,
*08:29.860- 08:33.080* :  and I'd written a line, contrast that to this,
*08:33.080- 08:35.420* :  and then the pictures of Joe Biden on Wednesday,
*08:36.200- 08:39.000* :  having difficulty on the steps of Air Force One.
*08:39.540- 08:40.660* :  And that is a huge picture.
*08:40.940- 08:44.640* :  The other crucial factor, and all this, is that the donors,
*08:44.640- 08:49.700* :  the big democratic donors, have started to get very cold feet about Joe Biden.
*08:50.120- 08:55.760* :  They were starting to withhold money, some fundraising events were starting to be cancelled.
*08:56.320- 09:00.580* :  And he was starting to fall a little bit behind in terms of the numbers this month,
*09:00.660- 09:03.140* :  the $1 on hand, et cetera, et cetera.
*09:03.800- 09:08.000* :  That is absolutely central in American political campaign.
*09:08.000- 09:12.660* :  You cannot run a successful campaign without a shed load of money.
*09:12.660- 09:15.940* :  And I mean, you know, almost $2 billion aside,
*09:15.940- 09:18.500* :  potentially, in the run up to November.
*09:18.980- 09:22.380* :  And if your big dollar donors are not feeling it,
*09:22.620- 09:23.820* :  then you don't stand any chance.
*09:23.820- 09:28.080* :  So that is also a huge factor in this decision unquestionably.
*09:28.340- 09:30.940* :  Unquestionably, incredibly important in those donations.
*09:31.840- 09:37.900* :  Joe Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris to replace him in the race for the White House.
*09:39.020- 09:40.700* :  What does this mean? What happens next now?
*09:41.920- 09:42.580* :  Yeah, it's interesting.
*09:42.580- 09:44.980* :  His initial statement did not endorse her,
*09:44.980- 09:46.760* :  and they seem to have rushed another one out,
*09:47.480- 09:51.300* :  half an hour later or so, and then another one telling people to give her money.
*09:52.580- 09:58.640* :  So what formally could happen now is that those delegates that were already pledged
*09:58.860- 10:02.200* :  at the National Convention, Chicago and the Middle of August to vote for Joe Biden,
*10:02.780- 10:04.140* :  he'll have to release those.
*10:05.220- 10:07.300* :  And we'll see what the mechanism are,
*10:07.300- 10:09.920* :  but they could decide to vote for Kamala Harris.
*10:09.920- 10:11.680* :  They could decide to vote for someone else.
*10:12.420- 10:15.440* :  There will have to be some kind of vote at the convention,
*10:16.440- 10:18.800* :  or perhaps before they may try and arrange it before,
*10:18.800- 10:21.060* :  but I think it probably goes to the convention.
*10:21.660- 10:24.700* :  And if anyone else decides to stand,
*10:24.700- 10:26.680* :  that could get very, very messy,
*10:26.680- 10:29.000* :  they haven't had a contested convention.
*10:29.820- 10:32.580* :  I think probably the late 60s is the last time that happened,
*10:32.580- 10:34.220* :  and that got very, very messy.
*10:35.000- 10:36.640* :  So we'll see exactly.
*10:36.640- 10:41.520* :  I'm sure the Democratic National Committee will come out and
*10:41.560- 10:43.740* :  try and sort of set out what their plans are,
*10:43.740- 10:45.720* :  but everything is now in flux.
*10:45.720- 10:47.680* :  Everything is up in the air, as you were saying.
*10:48.380- 10:51.440* :  And lots of people will be considering their future,
*10:51.960- 10:54.240* :  and in places like Michigan where I am now,
*10:54.740- 10:57.520* :  I was out talking to some democratic operatives this morning,
*10:58.300- 11:03.580* :  and they were very unsure, very anxious about the uncertainty at the top of the ticket,
*11:03.580- 11:05.640* :  just called it getting on with their jobs.
*11:06.220- 11:09.480* :  But their message was people need to make that their minds will now they have.
*11:10.120- 11:12.640* :  It's going to be more uncertainty before there's certainty, if you like,
*11:12.640- 11:18.020* :  and this will go for a good few weeks yet before they actually formally have a presidential nominee.
*11:18.960- 11:19.760* :  Gary O'Donnell here.
*11:20.500- 11:25.380* :  Even though it had seemed inevitable that Mr. Byton would have to give into the pressure not to run again,
*11:25.920- 11:28.920* :  I put it to our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman,
*11:28.940- 11:32.900* :  that it was still a stunning moment when his announcement came.
*11:33.440- 11:37.060* :  It was a stunning moment, particularly because it didn't leak beforehand.
*11:37.060- 11:41.720* :  In the hours running up to this, there wasn't any sense of a warning that this was about to happen.
*11:41.720- 11:47.080* :  It was just the letter that he released and tweeted in terms of making this announcement.
*11:47.740- 11:52.940* :  I think what happened was a critical mass built up within the congressional democratic party
*11:52.940- 11:58.080* :  and also crucially among donors that pulled the rug from under Joe Byton.
*11:58.360- 12:00.840* :  Now, I think he had a bit of a stay of execution, actually,
*12:00.840- 12:03.060* :  because it probably would have happened earlier,
*12:03.060- 12:05.680* :  in fact, even a week ago, last Sunday,
*12:06.260- 12:11.100* :  if it wasn't for the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on the Saturday night,
*12:11.100- 12:15.860* :  just over a week ago now, that really put a pause in all of this
*12:16.220- 12:21.100* :  and amid that, President Byton sort of regained a bit of momentum in terms of his candidacy
*12:21.440- 12:23.100* :  and carried on campaigning.
*12:23.100- 12:27.020* :  He flew to Nevada to Las Vegas this week.
*12:27.020- 12:29.320* :  I was on that trip, on Air Force One,
*12:29.320- 12:34.000* :  and his very last trip campaigning now for his own candidacy for the presidency.
*12:34.820- 12:40.780* :  But it was becoming clear, I think, during that trip that this attempt among congressional Democrats
*12:40.780- 12:46.540* :  to really persuade him to step aside was well and truly back on the pressure was building.
*12:46.540- 12:51.520* :  And that trip in Nevada ended in chaos and crisis,
*12:51.780- 12:56.040* :  as we were bizarrely at a campaign stop in a Mexican restaurant.
*12:56.040- 13:01.560* :  All of us press were ushered out as he carried on and did a radio interview.
*13:01.560- 13:05.620* :  We were sitting outside in the searing Nevada heat for about an hour and a half
*13:05.620- 13:08.320* :  to up to two hours, I think, while something was clearly wrong,
*13:08.820- 13:11.220* :  and what was actually happening was who's been tested for COVID.
*13:11.600- 13:12.560* :  He tested positive.
*13:12.940- 13:13.980* :  They pulled that trip.
*13:13.980- 13:18.440* :  We were rushed back to Air Force One to fly back to Delaware to his home,
*13:18.440- 13:20.800* :  where he's been effectively isolating since then.
*13:21.180- 13:24.520* :  So I think the writing was on the wall at that moment.
*13:24.940- 13:28.500* :  And really, the last, I think now, the last public appearance he has made
*13:28.500- 13:32.660* :  was walking down the steps of Air Force One in a jacket and cap at night,
*13:32.660- 13:34.680* :  having been tested positive for COVID,
*13:35.060- 13:37.720* :  looking really pretty frail and fragile,
*13:38.220- 13:41.240* :  walking very tentatively, cautiously and carefully.
*13:41.860- 13:45.360* :  And I think if there was a moment that it looked like things were over for him, it was then.
*13:46.460- 13:50.540* :  And he had been due to meet the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*13:50.540- 13:52.020* :  who's coming to Washington this week.
*13:53.820- 13:55.080* :  Yeah, he's flying tomorrow, actually.
*13:55.280- 13:56.280* :  That meeting is still on.
*13:56.280- 13:59.100* :  I think it will take place on Tuesday, as far as I'm aware.
*13:59.100- 14:00.300* :  It was due to happen tomorrow.
*14:00.300- 14:04.460* :  I think they delayed it slightly because of Mr. Biden's COVID,
*14:05.260- 14:06.440* :  the fact he's got COVID.
*14:06.520- 14:08.560* :  But that is still going ahead, I think,
*14:08.560- 14:09.560* :  that will take place on Tuesday,
*14:09.600- 14:11.220* :  because remember he continues his president.
*14:11.220- 14:13.820* :  He's made that abundantly clear in the statement.
*14:13.820- 14:18.080* :  And the said he wants to focus all of his energies on the end of his presidency now.
*14:19.160- 14:20.060* :  So that will continue.
*14:20.100- 14:22.920* :  And I mean, this is going to be a really, really big and controversial week
*14:22.920- 14:24.780* :  because the Israeli Prime Minister heads to Washington,
*14:24.780- 14:26.480* :  huge protests planned.
*14:27.020- 14:30.280* :  Some Democrats are extremely unhappy about the speech.
*14:30.700- 14:32.680* :  The fact that he's going to give a joint speech to Congress.
*14:32.680- 14:36.200* :  Many, many Republicans and some other Democrats are welcoming it.
*14:36.200- 14:36.940* :  Very happy about it.
*14:36.940- 14:39.740* :  But it's going to be a very controversial week.
*14:39.860- 14:44.200* :  And you know, Mr. Biden now sort of having to turn his attention to that
*14:44.760- 14:49.020* :  in the midst of a crisis that's reached his fruition in his own party.
*14:49.020- 14:51.420* :  And of course, then the race to find any candidate.
*14:52.220- 14:57.020* :  Come, Bateman, you're listening to a special edition of the global news podcast
*14:57.020- 15:01.620* :  about President Joe Biden's decision to end his reelection campaign.
*15:02.660- 15:05.820* :  Reaction is coming in from across the political spectrum.
*15:06.360- 15:09.680* :  Lindy Lee, a fundraiser and delegate for the Democratic Party,
*15:09.680- 15:11.480* :  as well as a friend of Joe Biden's,
*15:11.800- 15:14.740* :  explained how difficult the decision had been for him.
*15:15.180- 15:17.420* :  I know it was excruciatingly difficult.
*15:17.460- 15:20.460* :  I've been talking with people really close with him.
*15:20.460- 15:22.500* :  I spoke with him four days ago, resume.
*15:23.380- 15:27.320* :  And this morning, actually, I went on Fox News
*15:27.660- 15:31.420* :  and gently suggested to the president that he should consider stepping aside
*15:32.060- 15:34.460* :  and endorsing his vice president.
*15:35.380- 15:35.860* :  I'm shocked.
*15:35.860- 15:39.900* :  I'm still a little bit shaken that an hour after my interview aired, this happened.
*15:40.700- 15:43.580* :  So for me, this is, it hits very close to home.
*15:43.660- 15:47.040* :  And I've been one of its most stalwart supporters.
*15:47.280- 15:51.180* :  But I'm excited that this opens a new chapter for the Democratic nominee.
*15:51.800- 15:54.640* :  And as one of the top donors and bundlers of the party,
*15:54.640- 15:57.040* :  I'm in touch with a lot of my peers.
*15:57.640- 15:59.620* :  And they are excited to get back in the game.
*16:00.340- 16:03.440* :  Well, Mr. Biden's longtime political rival, Donald Trump,
*16:03.440- 16:05.540* :  responded soon after the announcement was made.
*16:06.000- 16:09.700* :  Mr. Trump posted to his own online platform, Truth Social.
*16:10.300- 16:11.960* :  His statement is read by a producer.
*16:12.440- 16:15.340* :  Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president,
*16:15.340- 16:18.820* :  and it's certainly not fit to serve and never was.
*16:19.380- 16:23.280* :  He only attained the position of president by lies, fake news,
*16:23.780- 16:25.380* :  and not leaving his basement.
*16:26.020- 16:28.900* :  All those around him, including his doctor and the media,
*16:29.280- 16:32.920* :  knew that he wasn't capable of being president and he wasn't.
*16:33.220- 16:35.520* :  And now look what he's done to our country
*16:36.000- 16:38.620* :  with millions of people coming across our border,
*16:38.620- 16:43.780* :  totally unchecked and unvetted, many from prisons, mental institutions,
*16:43.780- 16:45.860* :  and record numbers of terrorists.
*16:46.580- 16:49.000* :  We will suffer greatly because of his presidency,
*16:49.460- 16:52.440* :  but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly.
*16:52.960- 16:54.380* :  Make America great again.
*16:55.380- 16:58.020* :  Well, to gauge the reaction across America,
*16:58.420- 16:59.920* :  I spoke to Paul Moss.
*17:00.800- 17:03.120* :  I've got the full statement by the leader of the Democrats
*17:03.120- 17:06.140* :  in the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, who said President Biden
*17:06.140- 17:08.900* :  was a true patriot who'd once again put his country,
*17:08.900- 17:11.080* :  his party, and America's future first.
*17:11.680- 17:13.380* :  The Democratic governor of California,
*17:13.380- 17:17.260* :  Gavin Newsom, saying Mr. Biden fought hard for working people
*17:17.700- 17:20.360* :  and delivered astonishing results for all Americans.
*17:20.360- 17:23.620* :  Mark Hamill, star of the Star Wars movie,
*17:23.620- 17:27.560* :  has put his orin to say what an amazing person Joe Biden was.
*17:27.900- 17:28.900* :  But here's an important thing.
*17:28.900- 17:32.580* :  I've now got a post from the ex-account of Joe Biden
*17:32.580- 17:33.940* :  about his endorsement.
*17:34.300- 17:37.580* :  Decided not to accept the nomination, to focus on being president.
*17:37.620- 17:42.080* :  And he says, my very first decision as the party nominee in 2020
*17:42.140- 17:44.980* :  was to pick Kamala Harris as my vice president.
*17:44.980- 17:47.160* :  It's been the best decision I've made.
*17:47.180- 17:50.720* :  Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala
*17:51.100- 17:53.440* :  to be the nominee of our party this year, Democrats.
*17:53.440- 17:56.580* :  It's time to come together and beat Trump.
*17:57.100- 17:59.320* :  Now, there you are, that call for unity,
*17:59.320- 18:00.420* :  which is really essential.
*18:00.740- 18:03.160* :  And the spotlight will now shift to Kamala Harris,
*18:03.520- 18:05.340* :  who hasn't always had great press
*18:05.340- 18:07.180* :  during her time as vice president,
*18:07.600- 18:09.420* :  when she's had to deal with difficult issues,
*18:09.420- 18:11.380* :  such as migration at the southern border.
*18:11.760- 18:14.080* :  Indeed, I mean, vice presidents are sometimes seen
*18:14.080- 18:18.840* :  as a sort of punchball to keep the attention off the president
*18:18.840- 18:21.220* :  when it comes to difficult issues like immigration.
*18:21.220- 18:23.860* :  As such, she has been that person.
*18:23.920- 18:26.940* :  But no, she's managed to alienate both people
*18:26.940- 18:30.440* :  on the Republican side, but also some Democrats.
*18:30.440- 18:33.780* :  And just I want to add another thing that we're hearing
*18:33.780- 18:37.340* :  and I suspect this may be the first of similar comments.
*18:37.360- 18:38.920* :  This has just come in.
*18:39.380- 18:42.520* :  The top Republican in the Republican party member
*18:42.520- 18:45.800* :  in Congress, and that's Mike Johnson, the House Speaker,
*18:46.420- 18:50.560* :  has said this, Joe Biden must resign as president immediately.
*18:51.280- 18:54.180* :  He said, if Joe Biden is not fit for run for president,
*18:54.180- 18:56.520* :  he's not fit to serve as president.
*18:56.520- 18:58.260* :  He must resign the office immediately.
*18:58.780- 19:01.680* :  November 5th cannot arrive soon enough.
*19:02.000- 19:06.460* :  So I think we take that along with the Trump statement,
*19:06.460- 19:08.960* :  which was full of fury at Joe Biden,
*19:09.860- 19:12.860* :  saying he only got into power by lies and et cetera, et cetera.
*19:13.300- 19:15.520* :  I think we've got to say the idea of the divisive politics
*19:15.520- 19:16.880* :  we're going to see in the weeks ahead.
*19:17.200- 19:18.480* :  A bit of counterbalance that.
*19:18.540- 19:21.000* :  There's all these tributes are now pouring in
*19:21.000- 19:24.940* :  from Democrats, including a Roger Krishna Murthy,
*19:24.940- 19:26.680* :  a Democratic Party congressman.
*19:26.680- 19:28.820* :  Let's listen to the tribute he paid to the president.
*19:29.520- 19:32.600* :  I can't tell you how grateful people are to him
*19:32.600- 19:34.260* :  for his five decades of service.
*19:34.740- 19:37.620* :  It's not easy to do what he did, as you know.
*19:38.300- 19:41.740* :  And so for him to put the country above himself
*19:41.740- 19:46.380* :  is, in my view, one of the best indications
*19:47.140- 19:49.980* :  that he has put service above self.
*19:50.500- 19:53.020* :  And I think that's why he's going to go down
*19:53.020- 19:54.580* :  as one of the greats.
*19:55.000- 19:58.320* :  And a lot of Americans will be reflecting quite sadly
*19:58.320- 20:01.000* :  on this too, given the fact that he has had
*20:01.000- 20:03.140* :  this long distinguished record, even if a lot of them
*20:03.140- 20:05.960* :  did want him to go, because they felt he was simply too old,
*20:05.960- 20:07.920* :  too frail, too ill for the job.
*20:08.280- 20:10.480* :  I think so, and I think indeed that frailty,
*20:10.480- 20:12.540* :  which has been so clear, is in a sense
*20:12.540- 20:14.180* :  going to increase the sympathy, particularly
*20:14.180- 20:17.180* :  as what he's now dealing with is not the sort of frailty
*20:17.180- 20:19.440* :  that was being discussed until a few days ago,
*20:19.840- 20:22.280* :  or the comments on how he performed at the debate,
*20:22.280- 20:25.380* :  the gaps, et cetera, what he's now dealing with is COVID,
*20:25.960- 20:28.180* :  which many people will be able to relate to.
*20:28.180- 20:31.260* :  And many people know has been a particularly harsh virus
*20:31.260- 20:33.020* :  for older people to catch.
*20:33.020- 20:34.760* :  And therefore, there's going to be concern.
*20:34.760- 20:38.600* :  We're talking about a very old man who's now got COVID.
*20:38.600- 20:40.820* :  And as we heard earlier from Tom Bateman,
*20:40.820- 20:43.480* :  was looking particularly frail the last time
*20:43.480- 20:46.980* :  he was seen in public after COVID was diagnosed.
*20:47.020- 20:50.820* :  And so yes, I think there will be an outpouring of sympathy.
*20:50.820- 20:53.920* :  But as I've said, those comments from both Donald Trump,
*20:53.920- 20:56.980* :  the man who he was supposed to be taking on,
*20:57.340- 21:00.040* :  and the House Speaker Mike Johnson being very aggressive,
*21:00.040- 21:02.240* :  saying that Joe Biden should stand down now,
*21:02.240- 21:04.760* :  I think that gives us an idea that normal service,
*21:04.760- 21:08.020* :  indeed, very pugnacious service, will soon be resuming.
*21:08.680- 21:09.220* :  Paul Moss.
*21:10.120- 21:13.000* :  After arriving in Washington as one of the country's youngest
*21:13.000- 21:16.200* :  senators, Joe Biden now ends his bid for re-election
*21:16.200- 21:17.840* :  as the oldest president.
*21:18.600- 21:20.300* :  On North America editor, Sarah Smith
*21:20.300- 21:22.420* :  looks back at his presidential career.
*21:23.560- 21:25.180* :  When I ran for president four years ago,
*21:25.920- 21:28.000* :  I said we're in a battle for the sole of America,
*21:28.700- 21:29.600* :  and we still are.
*21:29.900- 21:32.200* :  Joe Biden's aide was already a huge concern,
*21:32.200- 21:34.940* :  even before he launched his campaign for re-election.
*21:35.640- 21:36.800* :  But his team shrugged it off.
*21:36.980- 21:39.160* :  Let's finish this job right now, we can't.
*21:39.760- 21:42.320* :  He confidently challenged Donald Trump to a debate,
*21:42.320- 21:43.900* :  thinking it would boost his support.
*21:44.020- 21:46.000* :  Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again.
*21:46.340- 21:47.800* :  We'll make my day, Paul.
*21:48.080- 21:49.080* :  I'll even do it twice.
*21:49.860- 21:51.100* :  So let's pick the day style.
*21:53.360- 21:56.260* :  We're live from Georgia, a key battleground state,
*21:56.260- 21:57.720* :  and the race for the White House.
*21:58.180- 22:01.840* :  It was a total disaster and set off panic inside his party.
*22:02.200- 22:04.380* :  Making sure that we continue to strengthen
*22:04.380- 22:06.280* :  our health care system, making sure
*22:06.280- 22:09.280* :  that we're able to make every single solitary person
*22:10.300- 22:14.740* :  eligible for what I've been able to do with the COVID,
*22:15.220- 22:18.360* :  excuse me, with dealing with everything
*22:18.360- 22:26.020* :  we have to do with, look, if we finally be Medicare.
*22:27.180- 22:28.520* :  The stakes are too high.
*22:30.160- 22:31.460* :  The stakes are too high.
*22:33.580- 22:35.720* :  A stronger performance at a rally the next day
*22:35.720- 22:38.400* :  was not enough to reassure voters that he's up to the job.
*22:38.580- 22:39.740* :  I'd give him my words of Biden.
*22:39.740- 22:41.600* :  I would not be running again if I didn't believe.
*22:42.000- 22:44.560* :  With all my heart and soul, I can do this job.
*22:44.560- 22:47.620* :  Because, quite frankly, the stakes are so high
*22:47.620- 22:49.760* :  that every verbal mishap caused alarm,
*22:50.140- 22:52.680* :  like when he confused the presidents of Mexico and Egypt.
*22:52.680- 22:57.220* :  As you know, initially, the president of Mexico,
*22:57.220- 22:59.840* :  C.C. did not want to open up the gate
*22:59.880- 23:03.000* :  to allow humanitarian material to get in.
*23:03.780- 23:04.640* :  I talked to him.
*23:05.120- 23:06.460* :  I convinced him to open the gate.
*23:06.740- 23:08.840* :  He seemed to forget where Russia is fighting a war.
*23:09.040- 23:11.680* :  He has Vladimir Putin, then we can buy Russian events.
*23:12.400- 23:14.720* :  I'm talking to Tom, but he's clearly losing the war
*23:14.720- 23:16.460* :  and we're actually losing the war at home.
*23:16.940- 23:19.980* :  And he referred to President Macron of France as Mitter-Om,
*23:20.180- 23:22.540* :  a man who left that office 30 years ago.
*23:22.640- 23:24.080* :  I said, America's back.
*23:25.140- 23:28.760* :  And Mitter-Om from Germany, I mean, from France looked at me
*23:29.520- 23:37.780* :  and said, you know, why, how long you back from?
*23:38.140- 23:40.380* :  But Biden's campaign dismissed as bedwaters.
*23:40.700- 23:42.460* :  Anyone who said concerns about his age
*23:42.680- 23:44.020* :  might cause him to lose the election.
*23:44.200- 23:45.620* :  A lot of thank you for the warm welcome.
*23:45.740- 23:47.160* :  At the White House correspondent's dinner,
*23:47.160- 23:49.080* :  he tried to kill the problem with a joke.
*23:49.220- 23:49.620* :  Of course.
*23:50.600- 23:52.760* :  The 2024 election is in full swing.
*23:53.780- 23:56.120* :  And yes, age is an issue.
*23:57.440- 24:01.760* :  I'm a grown man running against the six-year-old.
*24:03.120- 24:04.940* :  And a vigorous performance at his state
*24:04.940- 24:06.480* :  of the Union address in January,
*24:06.480- 24:09.040* :  quite in the critics in his party for a while.
*24:09.200- 24:12.140* :  This is the moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies.
*24:13.100- 24:14.020* :  Here's the simple truth.
*24:14.800- 24:17.660* :  You can't love your country only when you win,
*24:20.120- 24:23.140* :  but Republicans seized on and widely shared images
*24:23.140- 24:24.720* :  of him looking lost and confused.
*24:27.020- 24:28.220* :  You're not enjoying yourself.
*24:29.320- 24:31.700* :  Like the pictures of when he appeared frozen on the spot,
*24:31.980- 24:34.500* :  as others danced around him at an event on the White House
*24:34.540- 24:34.800* :  lawn.
*24:35.960- 24:38.000* :  Under extreme pressure, the president knew
*24:38.000- 24:39.720* :  he couldn't afford any more mistakes,
*24:40.340- 24:42.500* :  as he then said this at a NATO summit.
*24:42.780- 24:45.560* :  And now I want to hand over to the president of Ukraine
*24:46.200- 24:49.300* :  who has as much courage as he has determination.
*24:49.980- 24:51.380* :  Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin.
*24:53.160- 24:54.100* :  Take a look at what happened.
*24:55.300- 24:57.960* :  When Donald Trump was almost killed by an assassin's bullet,
*24:57.960- 25:00.700* :  there was a chance he would command so much attention
*25:00.700- 25:02.480* :  people would forget about Joe Biden.
*25:03.660- 25:08.040* :  But as Mr. Trump got up and defiantly carried on,
*25:08.620- 25:12.060* :  there was a striking contrast with a COVID-struck Mr. Biden.
*25:12.060- 25:13.040* :  I can't believe it!
*25:13.400- 25:14.820* :  I can present how do you feel?
*25:15.040- 25:17.880* :  Hulsing his campaign and making his weary way home.
*25:18.560- 25:22.620* :  Now, please welcome the 46th president of the United States, Joe Biden.
*25:24.740- 25:25.100* :  I'm sorry.
*25:26.860- 25:30.060* :  His fate was sealed when he stepped on stage for that debate.
*25:31.660- 25:32.400* :  Thank you very much.
*25:33.360- 25:36.000* :  He had called for it early to try to reset the race.
*25:36.040- 25:38.600* :  I'm going to continue the movement until we get the total ban.
*25:39.840- 25:43.620* :  The total initiative relative to what we're going to do
*25:43.620- 25:47.300* :  with more border patrol and more asylum officers.
*25:47.860- 25:48.300* :  President Trump?
*25:48.960- 25:50.960* :  I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence.
*25:50.960- 25:52.760* :  I don't think he knows what he said either.
*25:52.840- 25:55.560* :  His performance has forced him to exit the election.
