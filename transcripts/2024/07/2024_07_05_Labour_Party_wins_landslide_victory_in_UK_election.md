*01:34.200- 01:37.720* :  I'm Janet Gilliland, 13 hours GMT on Friday the 5th of July.
*01:37.720- 01:39.000* :  These are our main stories.
*01:39.680- 01:41.400* :  Britain has a new Prime Minister,
*01:41.400- 01:46.300* :  Kierstarma, after a landslide victory in the UK general elections for the Labour Party.
*01:46.700- 01:52.780* :  Our country has voted decisively for change, for national renewal,
*01:53.500- 01:57.320* :  and a return of politics to public service.
*01:57.620- 02:00.280* :  Following the Conservative Party's worst ever defeat,
*02:00.820- 02:03.100* :  Rishi Sunak apologises to the country.
*02:03.540- 02:06.360* :  I have heard your anger, your disappointment,
*02:07.280- 02:09.560* :  and I take responsibility for this loss.
*02:10.380- 02:13.240* :  I will step down as party leader, not immediately,
*02:14.260- 02:17.640* :  but once the formal arrangements for selecting my successor are in place.
*02:20.400- 02:23.540* :  Also in this podcast, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Victor Orb√°n,
*02:23.540- 02:28.280* :  has met President Putin in Moscow, a trip which has angered other European leaders.
*02:29.100- 02:32.760* :  And an a-rest for the Disney fortune has announced she's withholding donations
*02:32.800- 02:36.440* :  to the Democratic Party over President Biden's candidacy.
*02:40.440- 02:42.000* :  We begin this podcast in the UK,
*02:42.000- 02:46.020* :  where the Conservative government has suffered a crushing general election defeat
*02:46.020- 02:47.960* :  after 14 years in power.
*02:48.540- 02:51.680* :  With nearly all the results now in, as we record this podcast,
*02:51.680- 02:54.640* :  Labour has won well over 400 seats,
*02:55.060- 02:58.700* :  more than three times the number that the Conservatives have managed to cling onto.
*02:59.300- 03:03.420* :  Their tally of just over 120 seats stands in stark contrast
*03:03.420- 03:05.280* :  to the last election five years ago,
*03:05.760- 03:06.820* :  when under Boris Johnson,
*03:06.940- 03:08.440* :  their pledged to deliver Brexit,
*03:08.880- 03:12.160* :  one than the support of some voters who had traditionally backed Labour.
*03:12.980- 03:16.040* :  But now, with many worried about Britain's stagnating economy,
*03:16.040- 03:18.600* :  high taxes and struggling public services,
*03:19.040- 03:23.100* :  those voters have abandoned the Conservatives with many returning to Labour.
*03:23.960- 03:27.100* :  After being formally appointed Prime Minister by King Charles,
*03:27.580- 03:28.940* :  the Labour leader, Kierstammer,
*03:29.220- 03:31.180* :  addressed the nation outside Downing Street.
*03:31.180- 03:34.380* :  He said he realised the scale of the challenge ahead.
*03:34.380- 03:41.020* :  For too long now, we turned a blind eye as million slid into greater insecurity.
*03:41.860- 03:44.260* :  Nurses, builders, drivers, carers,
*03:44.560- 03:48.080* :  people doing the right thing, working harder every day.
*03:49.100- 03:51.880* :  Recognised at moments like this before,
*03:53.320- 03:56.240* :  yet, as soon as the cameras stop rolling,
*03:57.500- 03:58.920* :  their lives are ignored.
*04:01.260- 04:04.160* :  I want to say very clearly to those people,
*04:04.880- 04:06.560* :  not this time.
*04:08.220- 04:10.500* :  Changing a country is not like flicking a switch.
*04:11.300- 04:13.480* :  The world is now a more volatile place.
*04:14.780- 04:15.940* :  This will take a while,
*04:17.380- 04:21.840* :  but have no doubt that the work of change begins immediately.
*04:23.020- 04:26.420* :  Have no doubt that we will rebuild Britain.
*04:27.600- 04:29.380* :  You have given us a clear mandate,
*04:30.340- 04:32.440* :  and we will use it to deliver change,
*04:33.460- 04:35.980* :  to restore service and respect to politics,
*04:36.880- 04:38.860* :  and the era of noisy performance,
*04:39.780- 04:41.640* :  tread more lightly on your lives,
*04:42.880- 04:44.360* :  and unite our country.
*04:45.740- 04:48.880* :  Four nations, standing together again,
*04:49.820- 04:53.580* :  facing down as we have so often in our past,
*04:54.140- 04:56.960* :  the challenges of an insecure world,
*04:58.000- 05:01.580* :  committed to a calm and patient rebuilding.
*05:02.860- 05:04.700* :  So, with respect,
*05:05.940- 05:06.560* :  and humility,
*05:08.180- 05:12.640* :  I invite you all to join this Government of Service
*05:13.820- 05:16.340* :  in the mission of National Renewal.
*05:17.900- 05:19.400* :  Our work is urgent,
*05:20.800- 05:21.980* :  and we begin it today.
*05:22.780- 05:23.440* :  Thank you very much.
*05:28.340- 05:29.840* :  His predecessor, Rishi Sunak,
*05:29.860- 05:31.840* :  did manage to hold onto his own seat,
*05:31.840- 05:35.940* :  even though many high-profile members of the Conservative Party lost theirs,
*05:36.420- 05:38.740* :  including the woman he replaced, Liz Truss.
*05:39.440- 05:42.940* :  This is what Mr Sunak had to say outside 10 Downing Street earlier.
*05:43.400- 05:46.200* :  He began by addressing those who devoted for his party.
*05:46.940- 05:47.600* :  I am sorry.
*05:48.840- 05:50.320* :  I have given this job my all,
*05:51.660- 05:55.280* :  but you have sent a clear signal that the Government of the United Kingdom
*05:55.280- 05:59.920* :  must change, and yours is the only judgment that matters.
*06:01.020- 06:03.820* :  I have heard your anger, your disappointment,
*06:04.740- 06:07.020* :  and I take responsibility for this loss.
*06:08.340- 06:11.720* :  Following this result, I will step down as party leader,
*06:12.340- 06:17.360* :  not immediately, but once the formal arrangements for selecting my successor are in place.
*06:18.520- 06:22.420* :  It is important that after 14 years in Government, the Conservative Party rebuilds,
*06:22.980- 06:28.280* :  but also that it takes up its crucial role in opposition professionally and effectively.
*06:30.000- 06:31.560* :  Whilst he has been my political opponent,
*06:32.060- 06:34.600* :  Sir Keir Starmer will shortly become our Prime Minister.
*06:35.720- 06:40.240* :  In this job, his successes will be all our successors,
*06:40.760- 06:42.600* :  and I wish him and his family well.
*06:43.480- 06:45.240* :  Whatever our disagreements in this campaign,
*06:46.020- 06:48.940* :  he is a decent public-spirited man who I respect.
*06:50.280- 06:53.620* :  He and his family deserve the very best of our understanding
*06:54.460- 06:58.340* :  as they make the huge transition to their new lives behind this door.
*06:59.080- 07:04.120* :  And as he grapples with this most demanding of jobs in an increasingly unstable world.
*07:05.300- 07:07.500* :  One of the most remarkable things about Britain
*07:08.520- 07:13.920* :  is just how unremarkable it is that two generations after my grandparents came here with little,
*07:14.680- 07:19.040* :  I could become Prime Minister, and that I could watch my two young daughters
*07:19.580- 07:22.600* :  like the Vali candles on the steps in Downing Street.
*07:23.940- 07:27.060* :  We must hold true to that idea of who we are,
*07:27.940- 07:33.720* :  that vision of kindness, decency, and tolerance that has always been the British way.
*07:35.160- 07:40.300* :  This is a difficult day at the end of a number of difficult days,
*07:41.320- 07:44.500* :  but I leave this job honoured to have been your Prime Minister.
*07:45.420- 07:51.180* :  This is the best country in the world, and it is thanks entirely to you, the British people,
*07:52.020- 07:56.780* :  the true source of all our achievements, our strengths, and our greatness.
*07:57.940- 08:01.840* :  Thank you. Our political correspondent Rob Watson has been following developments
*08:01.840- 08:07.300* :  from Downing Street. This was not so much a labour victory as a conservative loss,
*08:07.300- 08:13.640* :  a collective two fingers up from the voters of Britain to the Conservatives after their 14 years
*08:13.980- 08:20.200* :  in power, because what you've really seen is labour yes with an absolute thumping parliamentary
*08:20.200- 08:26.100* :  majority, but actually with a relatively modest overall share of the votes cast.
*08:26.100- 08:33.200* :  This is not 1997, this is not cool Britannia, this is not welcome, Tony Blair, this is not a country
*08:33.700- 08:38.380* :  whose economy is booming, welcoming in at a younger Prime Minister, the times are different,
*08:38.700- 08:40.400* :  and I think Sir Kierstarma knows that.
*08:40.860- 08:46.540* :  And Kierstarma has done a remarkable job in turning around the labour party after it suffered
*08:47.100- 08:53.100* :  worst election result in decades, five years ago. The big question is, can he do the same for the
*08:53.100- 08:58.940* :  country? Well, it's a huge challenge, because essentially this was a vote against the Conservative
*08:58.940- 09:03.340* :  Party. It was also a vote against what many people in Britain were just describing as the
*09:03.340- 09:07.700* :  sense that nothing here works anymore, that the public services, as you mentioned, were
*09:08.100- 09:13.580* :  under strain, that tax is a high, and that they're looking for someone to fix that, but of course
*09:14.040- 09:18.760* :  that won't be easy, I mean it wasn't easy for the Conservatives, because you can't get away
*09:18.760- 09:23.540* :  from the harsh economic reality, and that is that Britain has a pretty high national debt,
*09:23.540- 09:27.280* :  like a lot of other European countries, that the economy isn't growing enough to provide the
*09:27.280- 09:33.460* :  tax revenues to pay for the public services that are an increasingly aging and ailing population
*09:33.660- 09:39.660* :  one, so it's going to be a massive, massive challenge, and also of course against a backdrop of
*09:40.160- 09:44.940* :  profound distrust and lack of confidence in politicians and the political system.
*09:45.720- 09:50.860* :  I should say a huge challenge, and lots of confidence in politicians, but Keir Starmer is
*09:50.860- 09:57.000* :  an unusual politician, doesn't have the charisma of some of its predecessors like Tony Blair or Boris
*09:57.000- 10:03.200* :  Johnson, but he does have a very solid record as a prosecutor, someone who entered politics
*10:03.200- 10:08.060* :  very late, for a lot of our listeners who'll be a bit of a mystery, tell them about him.
*10:09.420- 10:14.620* :  Yes, well, what he's trying to make is his trump card, if you like, is that he's not a career
*10:14.620- 10:19.880* :  politician, or hasn't been so far, he often says he's not a tribal politician, and he certainly
*10:19.880- 10:25.620* :  doesn't have any of the touches of flair that people would perhaps associate with Boris Johnson.
*10:25.660- 10:30.120* :  He only came to politics pretty late in life, he was in his fifties when he was elected,
*10:30.120- 10:35.360* :  an MP, spent his life as a human rights lawyer, and went on to have this big job as the country's
*10:35.740- 10:42.160* :  chief prosecutor, so he's had a responsible job in public service, and that is his whole sales pit
*10:42.160- 10:46.080* :  to the people, which is, you know, I'm not flash, it's not going to be super exciting,
*10:46.080- 10:51.780* :  but the very thing that I'm promising you, as we just heard, was a politics that treads more
*10:51.780- 10:56.360* :  likely on people's lives, a bit less drama, a bit less work for people like us to do.
*10:56.720- 11:01.960* :  And he knows that his honeymoon won't be long, and he is aware of the dangers of populism,
*11:02.200- 11:08.620* :  because we've seen the vote in Britain is fragmenting more than it used to, which is a system
*11:08.620- 11:13.800* :  in Britain, which has usually seen two big parties dominate. You're right, I mean, you have a
*11:13.800- 11:19.440* :  combination of a very low turnout this time, a diminishing vote share for the two big
*11:19.440- 11:24.880* :  parties that used to come on massive, massive support, and that does suggest a fragmentation,
*11:24.960- 11:30.600* :  and I have seen the theory advanced here in Westminster that this is the sort of last chance
*11:30.600- 11:36.680* :  for a government to be moderate and to resist Britain shifting to the populist right, as we've
*11:36.680- 11:41.680* :  seen in other European countries. I mean, whether that exactly is true or not, it's hard to say,
*11:41.680- 11:47.580* :  but I think it is the case that if this is a decisive result by Labour, there's no doubt about it,
*11:47.580- 11:52.020* :  will it be a return to stability? I think that depends on what Labour can crack, the challenges
*11:52.020- 11:57.300* :  that have faced governments all over Europe. Number one, to restore economic growth, to stop
*11:57.300- 12:03.940* :  living standards, stagnating, to get public services working, and to settle the really difficult
*12:03.940- 12:10.160* :  issues of, I guess, how we all get along, social cohesion in diverse societies, how you make
*12:10.160- 12:16.280* :  multiculturalism work, how you address the issue of net migration in a way that satisfies all
*12:16.280- 12:21.060* :  parts of the country. It won't be easy, but that is the challenge. If we're not going to see
*12:21.060- 12:25.880* :  another dramatic change in political fortunes at another five years time, Jeanette.
*12:26.200- 12:31.820* :  Rob Watson is not just the conservatives who've suffered huge losses. After dominating Scottish
*12:31.820- 12:37.280* :  politics for years, the pro-independent Scottish National Party has also experienced a wipeout.
*12:37.780- 12:43.460* :  From winning 48 of Scotland's 59 seats in the elections five years ago, it is, as we record
*12:43.460- 12:49.760* :  this podcast now, down to nine. The leader of the SNP Westminster is Stephen Flynn. He was one of
*12:49.760- 12:56.020* :  those who did manage to keep his seat. We are going to be beat in Scotland, and we are going to be
*12:56.020- 13:03.820* :  beat well. So now is the time where we must learn, and we must listen. We must listen to what the
*13:03.820- 13:09.300* :  people of Scotland have told us. So what does this Labour win mean for the people of Scotland?
*13:09.300- 13:16.360* :  Katie Hunter is our correspondent in Glasgow. Labour have won seat after seat here in Scotland,
*13:16.360- 13:22.760* :  but the biggest story of the night is the scale of the defeat for the Scottish National Party.
*13:23.260- 13:30.560* :  This is a party used to winning elections in recent years and winning big, so it has been a really,
*13:30.560- 13:35.520* :  really tough night for them. With just a few seats left to declare in Scotland, Labour
*13:35.520- 13:42.620* :  are currently sitting on 37 seats, the SNP on just nine, and to give you some context,
*13:42.620- 13:49.800* :  you mentioned that the last general election in 2019, the SNP 148 seats in Scotland,
*13:49.840- 13:56.620* :  and Labour won just a single seat back then. So the turnaround overnight has been huge, and
*13:57.000- 14:03.380* :  I'm in Glasgow overlooking the Clyde, and a few weeks ago, all of Glasgow seats were in
*14:03.380- 14:10.240* :  SNP hands. For people waking up this morning, the city, Scotland's biggest city, has turned red.
*14:10.240- 14:17.680* :  Labour have won all six of Glasgow seats from the SNP, and I think the story here in Scotland's
*14:17.680- 14:24.220* :  biggest city has been replicated in constituencies across Scotland, particularly in the central belt
*14:24.220- 14:30.840* :  of Scotland. So why did the SNP fare so badly, and what does that mean for hopes of independence
*14:30.840- 14:37.180* :  for Scotland? Well, that's a big question on independence, and I think a question, the SNP will spend
*14:37.940- 14:45.200* :  the coming weeks and months asking themselves. First Minister and SNP leader John Swinney,
*14:45.200- 14:51.320* :  he's only been in the job for around eight weeks. It has been a tough year or so for the SNP,
*14:51.320- 14:58.300* :  he has acknowledged that, and he said it had been a difficult and damaging night for the SNP,
*14:58.760- 15:05.020* :  and a lot of soul searching would lie ahead. Now the party did in their manifesto have the issue
*15:05.020- 15:10.780* :  of independence on page one, line one of that manifesto. You know, John Swinney was talking
*15:10.780- 15:15.880* :  about independence, but there are certainly some independent supporters that don't think the issue
*15:15.880- 15:20.980* :  was front and center enough during the campaign. In the days running up to this election,
*15:20.980- 15:25.740* :  John Swinney was telling voters this election would be on a knife edge in Scotland too close to
*15:25.740- 15:31.040* :  call here. The result has proved far from too close to call. The SNP have lost in Scotland,
*15:31.040- 15:36.960* :  and they have lost stake. Keji Hunter, leaders around the world have been congratulating the new
*15:36.960- 15:41.480* :  British Prime Minister. The French President Emmanuel Macron said he looked forward to working with
*15:41.480- 15:47.020* :  Keir Starmer. Ukraine's leader, Vladimir Zelensky, welcomed Labour's win, saying Britain would remain
*15:47.020- 15:53.560* :  a reliable ally under Mr Starmer. But behind the warm words offered the trauma of the Brexit years,
*15:53.760- 15:59.580* :  can we expect any changes in the relationship between the UK and its European neighbours under
*15:59.580- 16:04.280* :  a Labour government? I put that question to our correspondent in Berlin, Damian McGuinness.
*16:04.800- 16:07.100* :  Yeah, I think that's definitely the question everyone here on the
*16:07.100- 16:13.140* :  constant of Europe is asking in general. And I think one thing we can say is that Britain rejoin
*16:13.140- 16:18.800* :  the EU anytime soon is off the cards. That has been stated quite clearly by Keir Starmer who doesn't
*16:19.100- 16:23.840* :  it seems want to reopen that quite ferocious debate that Britain had for many years about
*16:23.840- 16:28.300* :  whether to be in or out the EU. And also, you know, it has to be said there is a lack of trust
*16:28.300- 16:34.560* :  on the EU side in Britain's ability to stay calm and non chaotic. And I think what we've seen
*16:34.560- 16:40.940* :  over the last few years is a real lack of interest of what happens in the UK because of perceived chaos
*16:40.980- 16:47.200* :  and this constant churn of PMs going in and out in number 10. All that has now changed. And we're
*16:47.200- 16:51.640* :  seeing that in press coverage across Europe where people are suddenly looking to London again
*16:51.640- 16:56.900* :  and thinking, ah, someone new back in number 10 and someone who maybe we can talk to. So what we've
*16:56.900- 17:03.900* :  seen as you say, President MacKars, congratulated Keir Starmer also lots of politicians from all our
*17:03.900- 17:09.800* :  shots as centre-left party and what we see across the continent are certainly centre-left and
*17:09.800- 17:15.100* :  centrist politicians thinking, okay, we've got someone in London we can now talk to. And I think
*17:15.100- 17:19.240* :  that's what it's really about. It's not so much that anything concrete is going to change in
*17:19.240- 17:25.160* :  the straight away in terms of the deals between London and Brussels, but certainly the tone,
*17:25.600- 17:32.640* :  the relationship and the manner of how London talks to the rest of Europe is going to change.
*17:32.720- 17:37.400* :  And I think there's a lot of relief here about that because the debate or the relationships have
*17:37.400- 17:42.820* :  been strained. And I think it's been a lack of trust here on the continent towards London. And I
*17:42.820- 17:47.320* :  think now people feel that they have someone in Keir Starmer they can talk to who's seen as a
*17:47.320- 17:52.780* :  non populist and someone who's not going to sort of fight unnecessary battles with the EU. So I
*17:52.780- 17:57.140* :  think it's going to be the start of rebuilding that relationship in a reset if you like. I think
*17:57.140- 18:02.340* :  that's how it's been seen here. And another key issue for Europe is the war in Ukraine and the UK
*18:02.340- 18:08.480* :  has been a key player in regards to support for Keir. Yeah and of course as you'll know that
*18:08.480- 18:13.420* :  support is cross-party in the UK. So it's not likely that much is going to change there, but
*18:13.420- 18:20.080* :  certainly from the European perspective there's a huge appetite for more cooperation with the UK
*18:20.080- 18:26.360* :  and certainly under a new more pragmatic leader. And so one of the areas where the EU is very
*18:26.360- 18:31.360* :  aware that they it will be in their interest to work with the UK more closely is on defence and
*18:31.360- 18:36.000* :  security. So I think what we're definitely going to see are more talks on defence and security
*18:36.040- 18:42.540* :  and that obviously involves Ukraine. But particularly in the run-up to elections in the US in the
*18:42.540- 18:47.620* :  autumn because I think there's a big awareness here that if Donald Trump is once again president
*18:48.260- 18:53.300* :  then there's going to be lots of questions about whether you can rely on the US and you know what
*18:53.300- 18:59.220* :  does that mean for NATO. A lot of nervousness about that particularly here in Germany and that's
*18:59.220- 19:04.420* :  where the UK comes in. So I think what we've already been seeing the past few months is lots of talks
*19:04.420- 19:11.240* :  between Berlin and the Labour Party and Shadow Ministers and so already people have been laying
*19:11.240- 19:16.200* :  the groundwork particularly on security and defence and I think we're going to see possibly that's
*19:16.200- 19:20.640* :  going to be one of the areas where there would be more change and possibly more cooperation.
*19:24.840- 19:29.600* :  Still to come in this podcast as Hurray came barrel makes landfall in Mexico we hear about the

*21:02.700- 21:07.860* :  you're listening to the global news podcast European leaders have reacted with anger and
*21:07.860- 21:13.860* :  disbelief at the news that the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban has gone to Russia rumours
*21:13.860- 21:18.760* :  of the trip began to spread on Wednesday and now a plane used by the Hungarian government has landed
*21:18.760- 21:24.120* :  in Moscow so why has this trip provoked such strong feelings our Europe region editor
*21:24.120- 21:29.920* :  Paul Moss explains they take it in turns to be in charge among the European Union's elected leaders
*21:30.380- 21:35.760* :  and Victor Orban's only held the position of council president since Monday but rather than
*21:35.760- 21:42.240* :  slowly easing his way into the post he's begun by taking just about the most provocative step he
*21:42.240- 21:48.320* :  could as far as many fellow EU leaders are concerned his visit to Moscow was described by the
*21:48.320- 21:55.140* :  Finnish Prime Minister Petri Orpo as disturbing Poland's Donald Tusk express disbelief at the news
*21:55.780- 22:01.620* :  that's because Victor Orban is a close ally of Vladimir Putin and has repeatedly tried to block
*22:01.620- 22:07.860* :  EU measures designed to help Ukraine earlier this week Mr Orban went to Kiev and apparently tried
*22:07.860- 22:14.140* :  to persuade Vladimir Zelensky to accept a ceasefire something many believe would suit Moscow giving
*22:14.140- 22:19.940* :  it more time to build up Russia's military strength in an interview on Friday morning Victor Orban
*22:19.940- 22:25.780* :  insisted that any visit to Moscow would be on a bilateral basis but let's there be any doubt
*22:25.780- 22:31.500* :  the European Union's foreign policy chief was emphatic Joseph Burrell said in a statement that
*22:31.500- 22:38.560* :  Victor Orban had no right to negotiate on behalf of the European Union. Paul Moss now to the
*22:38.560- 22:43.740* :  Gaza conflict Israel's spy chief is expected in Qatar today for the latest diplomatic efforts to
*22:43.740- 22:49.100* :  try to reach a ceasefire which will see the hostages being held by Hamas released our Middle East
*22:49.100- 22:56.140* :  correspondent Yorland Nell told us more. What's really important is that the Israelis have sent
*22:56.200- 23:01.240* :  you know the head of the Mossad Intelligence Service this suggests a real seriousness on their
*23:01.240- 23:09.020* :  parts to resume these stool talks and we know that the head of Mossad is supposed to meet the
*23:09.020- 23:16.520* :  the Qaturi Prime Minister later we've had a sort of steer from a senior US official who has been
*23:16.520- 23:23.840* :  talking to journalists anonymously but but really saying that there is some kind of a break
*23:23.840- 23:30.540* :  through in terms of the shift in the Hamas position that has been seen really what we're understanding
*23:30.540- 23:36.980* :  from Palestinian sources is that they are no longer demanding that there should be a full ceasefire
*23:36.980- 23:45.180* :  from the outset of this three phase a deal to implement a ceasefire and have the hostages released
*23:45.180- 23:52.780* :  that Palestinian armed groups are still holding in Gaza and that seems to give some some room
*23:52.780- 24:00.320* :  for negotiations to advance. Yorland Nell India's main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has urged the
*24:00.320- 24:05.580* :  authorities to offer more financial help to those who lost their relatives in a deadly crush
*24:05.580- 24:11.220* :  earlier this week. Mr. Gandhi made the comments after meeting grieving families in Uttar Pradesh
*24:11.620- 24:14.840* :  our South Asia correspondent Ambrassanesha Rajan reports from Delhi.
*24:15.340- 24:21.360* :  Rahul Gandhi said the families of the deceased had told him police security had been inadequate
*24:21.360- 24:26.540* :  at the religious event on Tuesday he also asked the Uttar Pradesh state government to pay
*24:26.540- 24:34.320* :  compensation as early as possible as most of the victims are from poor families more than 120 people
*24:34.320- 24:40.620* :  most of them women were trampled to death as a crowd surged to get the blessings of a spiritual leader
*24:41.100- 24:47.280* :  Suraj Paul Singh known by his followers as Narae and Sakhar Hari as he was leaving the venue.
*24:48.200- 24:53.720* :  Ambrassanesha Rajan. Iranians are voting today in the run-off round of a presidential election which
*24:53.720- 24:59.560* :  offers a choice between Saeed Jalili a hardline conservative who's close to Iran's supreme leader
*24:59.560- 25:05.700* :  Ayatollah Ali Hamani and Masud Pazeshkian a reformist who has backed pragmatic cooperation with the
*25:06.660- 25:12.360* :  West but with many people disillusioned with the process turnout is expected to be low as it was
*25:12.360- 25:18.500* :  for the first round. The election was called after Iran's previous president Ebrahim Reisi was killed
*25:18.500- 25:24.520* :  in the helicopter crash in May. Sivash Ardalan from BBC Persian told us more about the candidates.
*25:25.320- 25:31.380* :  It's very unpredictable at this stage unlike UK elections this is one of Iran's the contradiction
*25:31.380- 25:36.400* :  of Iran's political system where you have so much unpredictability in an election in a country
*25:36.400- 25:40.880* :  where it has some features of a democratic system but also some features of a theocracy.
*25:41.860- 25:45.700* :  It's hanging in the balance and it really depends on whether more people turn out to vote
*25:45.700- 25:49.940* :  this time around those people who chose to buy-cut the election as an act of civil disobedience
*25:50.280- 25:54.600* :  who would rather now not have an hardline president and choose someone who is moderate
*25:55.040- 25:59.100* :  at least not to make things go from bad to worse and the conservative camp
*26:00.060- 26:03.840* :  and people who voted for the center right candidate who lost to came in third but
*26:03.840- 26:09.000* :  won 13% of the vote and that can be king maker. So if the same number of people who turned up
*26:09.000- 26:14.880* :  last time which was 40% turned up again and those conservatives within them who voted for the
*26:14.880- 26:19.080* :  center right candidate choose to vote for the moderate one rather than the hardline president
*26:19.560- 26:23.280* :  then we can see an upsetting Iranian politics and for the first time in eight years
*26:24.240- 26:29.720* :  this a session and victory of a moderate president. Let's say the moderate candidate was to get in
*26:30.580- 26:34.220* :  how much difference would that make because the reason they're such a low turnout is because
*26:34.220- 26:39.560* :  people have voted for moderates in the past only to see them unable to do very much because it's
*26:39.560- 26:44.720* :  a hardline clerics that hold the real power in Iran. Well the biggest achievement of the moderates
*26:45.140- 26:49.200* :  especially president Hassan Rouhani and his administration was to strike a nuclear deal
*26:49.200- 26:55.300* :  with the U.S. and the other big powers and then it was president Donald Trump from the U.S.
*26:55.300- 27:01.420* :  withdrew from that nuclear agreement and that's why Iran's hardliners have become more powerful
*27:01.820- 27:06.560* :  therefore if this moderate president as he promised manages to strike another deal with the
*27:06.560- 27:12.400* :  West even with Donald Trump say being the next president that can make a significant difference
*27:12.400- 27:16.340* :  in the day-to-day life of people of Iran and the country's economy.
*27:19.060- 27:24.840* :  Yucatan Peninsula is being battered by ferocious winds and there are warnings of a dangerous storm
*27:24.840- 27:30.180* :  surge with the arrival of Hurricane Barrel. The storm has left a trail of destruction across the
*27:30.180- 27:35.960* :  Caribbean and the coast of Venezuela at least 10 people are known to have died. One of the worst
*27:35.960- 27:42.500* :  hit islands is Karyaku in Grenada, a scene of devastation. Devon Andrews, Minister for Karyaku
*27:42.640- 27:47.360* :  and Petit Martinique spoke to Victoria Wakunda about situation on the island.
*27:48.060- 27:55.480* :  The assessment that we have done thus far is indicating that over 98 percent of the island
*27:56.500- 28:03.620* :  has been devastated. Be it our schools, be it our healthcare facilities including our
*28:03.880- 28:11.640* :  loan hospital on the island, be it our loan senior citizen home on the island, be our airport,
*28:12.840- 28:18.660* :  be it our police station, all government buildings, businesses, infrastructure,
*28:19.340- 28:25.580* :  our utility companies were affected, our banks were affected, homes are completely destroyed,
*28:25.580- 28:31.100* :  people are homeless, our gas station was compromised, thank God it's not up and running.
*28:32.440- 28:38.440* :  Communication was a massive issue because all our towers and services were down.
*28:39.100- 28:46.900* :  It's like a war zone, it's like a bomb landed on the two islands which I am responsible for.
*28:47.660- 28:58.440* :  I cannot express the overwhelming feeling of grief, hurt, frustration and a sense at times hopelessness
*28:59.320- 29:06.060* :  that comes over me as a person responsible for leading the affairs of this beautiful islands.
*29:06.540- 29:13.740* :  I'm grateful for the support that we've been receiving thus far from the government of Grenada
*29:14.540- 29:21.440* :  but we need more, we need help. 98 percent of the island is completely gone.
*29:22.520- 29:26.080* :  Where are the people who've been made homeless now? Where are they living?
*29:27.100- 29:31.760* :  Some people are living in shelters and mine you some of those shelters that we had at Hurricane
*29:32.020- 29:40.640* :  was compromised. One of them was Dover government school, the building crumbled, thank God,
*29:41.440- 29:44.420* :  the people that went there to shelter the hurricane are all safe.
*29:45.640- 29:50.580* :  They managed to run out during the storm and into the school's library.
*29:51.020- 29:57.400* :  Most people are living downstairs their home with no roof or no upstairs and of course when rain falls
*29:58.240- 30:03.780* :  they get wet. In some instances we're encouraging people to leave the island and in some cases
*30:04.520- 30:09.020* :  they make a make a makeshift home for themselves at the broken down hole.
*30:10.200- 30:13.700* :  Tevin Andrews, Minister for Carriacco and Petite Martinique.
*30:14.860- 30:19.800* :  An Ares to the Disney fortune has said she will withhold donations to democratic party until
*30:19.800- 30:26.200* :  President Joe Biden withdrawals from the US presidential race. Abigail Disney, a longstanding
*30:26.200- 30:31.960* :  democratic donor, was speaking amid growing calls for Mr. Biden to drop out from the race for the
*30:31.960- 30:37.380* :  White House after his dismal performance against Donald Trump in last week's first televised
*30:37.380- 30:44.300* :  presidential debate. Peter Bose told us more. Abigail Disney is a filmmaker, she's a prominent Hollywood
*30:44.300- 30:50.840* :  figure for anthropist and longtime donor to the Democrats and in a quite strongly worded statement
*30:50.840- 30:56.580* :  that she issued first of all to CNBC the business news television network here in the stage.
*30:56.580- 31:03.480* :  She said she would stop any contributions to the Democrats unless and until they replace Biden
*31:03.480- 31:10.540* :  at the top of the ticket. She said a good man who'd served his country admirably but the election
*31:10.540- 31:18.800* :  stakes were far too high. She said the consequences of him losing were genuinely dire and of course
*31:18.800- 31:24.760* :  this comes in the wake as you imply of Mr. Biden saying that he has no intention of pulling
*31:24.760- 31:30.560* :  out of the race. If he is rethinking he's not showing that publicly. He did meet democratic
*31:30.560- 31:35.620* :  governors at the White House and they came out with quite a supportive message saying that they
*31:35.620- 31:40.700* :  believe that he is the right person to challenge Donald Trump in the November election. I think
*31:40.700- 31:45.620* :  the thing that's going to happen next that is going to be potentially crucial to this is a
*31:45.620- 31:51.700* :  primetime television interview that Joe Biden is giving to the ABC television network. This will
*31:51.700- 31:57.500* :  air local time on Friday night and he will be of course asked questions that he will have to
*31:57.500- 32:02.840* :  respond to off the cuff. There'll be no teleprompter. There'll be no script. This will be Joe Biden
*32:02.840- 32:09.400* :  in a long interview having to think on his feet speaker. He runs and talking a way that impresses
*32:09.740- 32:14.640* :  his voters to the point that they believe that he has what it takes to take on Donald Trump.
*32:15.240- 32:20.340* :  Peter Bose, let's return now to our main story. The landslide victory for labor
*32:20.340- 32:24.700* :  in Britain's general election. Here's how the events unfolded.
*32:27.180- 32:33.160* :  And as Big Ben strikes 10 the exit poll is predicting a labor landslide.
*32:33.440- 32:38.480* :  But now I think it's Mary Morden, commonly known as Penny Morden, the Conservative Party candidate,
*32:39.240- 32:52.220* :  13,715. Democracy is never wrong. Tonight the Conservative Party has taken a battering
*32:53.000- 32:57.800* :  because it failed to honour the trust that people had placed in it.
*32:58.620- 33:04.060* :  Penny Morden, they're unsurprisingly perhaps looking very upset having fought very hard to keep
*33:04.060- 33:14.120* :  her seat. Farage Nigel Paul, reform UK, 21,2025. It is a massive gap on the centre right of
*33:14.120- 33:23.400* :  British politics and my job is to fill it. Trust, Liz, the Conservative Party candidate, 11,217.
*33:24.360- 33:29.200* :  The former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has lost her seat and this
*33:29.200- 33:35.780* :  captain appalling night for the Conservatives. To the country I would like to say first and foremost
*33:36.700- 33:43.900* :  I am sorry. I have given this job my all but you have sent a clear signal that the government
*33:43.900- 33:49.680* :  of the United Kingdom must change and yours is the only judgment that matters.

*34:03.920- 34:08.760* :  formal arrangements for selecting my successor are in place. I feel like having competent
*34:08.760- 34:13.300* :  adults in the room again is going to be a big help governing a country should be complicated
*34:14.000- 34:18.040* :  and it shouldn't be a thing that is done by people who are just jockeying for personal
*34:18.040- 34:21.460* :  advantage in the way that we have seen. I don't think anything is going to change.

*34:30.580- 34:36.180* :  I don't think a lot of change to be honest. I have got the doctors to sew out, the railways
*34:36.180- 34:41.820* :  to sew out, it is a big job. The gates are open causing a cheer to go up.

*34:56.480- 35:03.500* :  This will take a while but have no doubt that the work of change begins immediately.
*35:03.500- 35:12.920* :  I invite you all to join this government of service in the mission of National Renewal.
