*01:19.560- 01:22.680* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.340- 01:30.040* :  I'm Gillette Gillil and in the early hours of Friday, the 19th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:30.600- 01:35.940* :  President Biden is facing renewed pressure from fellow Democrats to abandon his re-election bid
*01:35.940- 01:40.720* :  with Barack Obama reported to have joined those questioning whether he can beat Donald Trump.
*01:41.640- 01:45.440* :  The internet has been shut down in Bangladesh as the authorities struggle to contain
*01:45.440- 01:52.200* :  student protests over job quotas. Health experts have called for urgent action to stop the spread
*01:52.200- 02:00.740* :  of drug-resistant malaria in Africa. Also in this podcast, we hear about the latest threat to
*02:00.860- 02:10.420* :  rare endangered birds. The increasingly lucrative trade in their eggs.
*02:15.380- 02:21.880* :  The pressure is intensifying on President Biden, with even Barack Obama now reportedly questioning
*02:21.880- 02:28.780* :  whether he has what it takes to beat Donald Trump. A concern echoed by other democratic heavyweights
*02:28.780- 02:34.520* :  including Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. As we record this podcast, reports are coming in that Ms
*02:34.520- 02:40.800* :  Pelosi has told some Democrats in Congress that she believes Mr. Biden can be convinced fairly
*02:40.800- 02:47.220* :  soon to exit the presidential race. The 81-year-old president has already had to suspend campaigning
*02:47.220- 02:54.480* :  after contracting COVID-19. His woes stand in stark contrast to the adulation being lablished
*02:54.480- 03:00.060* :  on Donald Trump after his narrow escape from being assassinated. On North America Editor
*03:00.060- 03:05.460* :  Sarah Smith reports from Milwaukee where Mr. Trump is due to address his jubilant supporters
*03:05.460- 03:10.640* :  at the Republican Party's national convention. Speculation is mounting over whether
*03:10.640- 03:15.220* :  Joe Biden might soon announce he's stepping aside as a democratic presidential candidate.
*03:16.040- 03:21.140* :  He's isolating at home in Delaware after testing positive for COVID and is said to be open to
*03:21.140- 03:26.260* :  considering changing his mind about running for re-election. He has been told by some of his closest
*03:26.260- 03:31.160* :  friends inside the party that he is on course to lose to Donald Trump. While former President
*03:31.160- 03:35.780* :  Barack Obama has said to have told allies he thinks Mr. Biden is to seriously consider the
*03:35.780- 03:41.680* :  viability of his candidacy. Last week the president called into the morning Joe TV show on MSNBC
*03:41.680- 03:47.200* :  to say he would not step down. This morning its host Joe Scarborough had a message for Mr. Biden's
*03:47.200- 03:54.820* :  closest advisors. It's really incumbent on people that are around Joe Biden to step up at this point
*03:54.820- 04:02.800* :  and help the president and help the man they love and do the right thing. Top Democrats who already
*04:02.800- 04:06.880* :  feared that Joe Biden would probably lose the White House and know worried that he'll drag down
*04:06.880- 04:10.520* :  other candidates and lose them the House of Representatives and the Senate too.
*04:11.320- 04:15.320* :  Campaign donations are drying up and the president has had to suspend campaigning because he's
*04:15.320- 04:20.720* :  unwell. Meanwhile here at the Republican Convention in Milwaukee Donald Trump will give his speech
*04:20.720- 04:26.020* :  tonight greeted by a rapturous crowd who believe that they're now on course for a big victory.
*04:27.240- 04:31.760* :  Sarah Smith will also at that convention in Milwaukee as our North America correspondent Nomea
*04:32.140- 04:39.380* :  what are we expecting from Donald Trump's speech? We understand that he will be focusing on the issue
*04:39.380- 04:45.800* :  of unity. He spoke to the Washington Examiner newspaper on Sunday a day after he survived
*04:45.800- 04:52.820* :  that assassination attempt and he said that he had decided to rewrite his speech so he plans to
*04:52.820- 04:58.420* :  switch from attacks on President Joe Biden's policies to a message of unity and he said that it
*04:58.420- 05:03.620* :  was going to be a whole different speech a lot different than it would have been two days ago
*05:04.380- 05:09.380* :  and he will give that speech later this evening. There are lots of people that will be in attendance
*05:09.380- 05:16.140* :  beforehand. You've got people like Hulk Hogan, the former wrestler, you've got the news anchor,
*05:16.140- 05:20.940* :  Tucker Carlson as well. We believe his wife Melania Trump. We don't know if she'll speak but
*05:20.940- 05:25.980* :  his wife is here as well as his daughter Ivanka Trump. And he'll get a rapturous reception.
*05:26.040- 05:30.500* :  There's no doubt about that but what do Republicans make of the democratic disarray over whether
*05:30.680- 05:37.360* :  Joe Biden should run again? I think the Republicans are very much enjoying it because for so long
*05:37.360- 05:41.940* :  their party has been seen as the one of chaos four years ago or three and a half years ago after
*05:41.940- 05:46.600* :  Donald Trump lost the White House. There was a sense that Republicans were moving away from
*05:46.600- 05:52.860* :  Donald Trump especially following the January 6 riots but he is advanced this stunning political
*05:52.860- 05:57.680* :  comeback and being here at the convention when I speak to Republicans, Republican delegates,
*05:58.440- 06:03.880* :  they are so unified behind him. You know they're almost sort of looking at the Democrats as the
*06:03.880- 06:08.900* :  party that's falling apart. So as Donald Trump rises Joe Biden it seems as falling and his supporters
*06:09.720- 06:14.020* :  breaking away. I spoke to many Republican delegates on the floor about how they felt regarding
*06:14.020- 06:18.100* :  President Biden's health and fragility. If they think he should stand down and some of them
*06:18.100- 06:22.680* :  were saying we want him to run. We want him to go against Donald Trump because they believe
*06:22.680- 06:27.440* :  that Trump will beat him. They also think that any democratic candidate that's put forward
*06:27.920- 06:32.820* :  Donald Trump will beat. They have that much confidence in the former president but for the most
*06:32.820- 06:39.760* :  part yes Republicans do view what's happening to the democratic parties and to their advantage
*06:39.760- 06:45.960* :  and that's the way politics works I guess. Nomiya Iqbal, well in an exclusive interview with
*06:45.960- 06:51.200* :  the BBC, Ukraine's President Zelensky says any pressure from the West to end the war with Russia
*06:51.200- 06:57.080* :  quickly would be at the expense of his people. He was speaking after attending a gathering of
*06:57.080- 07:02.560* :  dozens of European leaders at the historic Blenheim Palace here in England. Many of them fear that
*07:02.560- 07:07.980* :  if Donald Trump is reelected US President he could withdraw American military support.
*07:08.680- 07:13.760* :  Our political editor Chris Mason asked President Zelensky what he thought about Mr. Trump's
*07:13.900- 07:19.860* :  frequent claims that he could end the war in 24 hours if he ends up back in the White House.
*07:20.800- 07:26.860* :  Everybody will be happy if one person in the world and this person Donald Trump can stop
*07:26.860- 07:33.660* :  the war during 20 whole four hours. The question is what the price and who will pay?
*07:34.580- 07:41.680* :  So do you think you might buy? I think he's idea to push us to pay but if he want to do it during
*07:41.680- 07:50.420* :  24 hours the simple way is to push us to pay because it's understandable how it means just stop
*07:50.420- 07:57.860* :  and give and forget sanctions out everything out he will Putin will take the land Putin will
*07:57.860- 08:06.580* :  made a victory for his society we will never go on this never and there is no any guy in the
*08:06.580- 08:13.080* :  world who can push us to do it. Donald Trump this week has picked the man he would like to be his
*08:13.080- 08:20.660* :  Vice President JD Vance who has said in the past that he doesn't really care what happens in
*08:20.660- 08:29.420* :  Ukraine one way or another. What do you make of those remarks? Maybe he really doesn't understand
*08:29.420- 08:35.260* :  what goes on in Ukraine. So for us we have to work with the United States and if new team will
*08:35.260- 08:41.300* :  come we have to work with them we need this hard work. I guess hard work. Could be hard work
*08:41.300- 08:48.860* :  to push us? We don't we don't I mean we don't afraid of hard work. Did your heart sink last week
*08:48.900- 08:55.920* :  when President Biden standing right next to you introduced you as President Putin of all people
*08:57.260- 09:04.400* :  even purplative? No he just made a mistake honestly for me it means nothing. Next let's go to Bangladesh
*09:12.980- 09:18.220* :  We are the protests against new rules when the hiring of civil servants have escalated even
*09:18.220- 09:23.880* :  further. Students at fire to the offices of the Bangladeshi State Broadcaster in Dhaka forcing
*09:23.880- 09:29.440* :  it off air. More than 20 people are reported to have been killed in the past few days of violence
*09:29.500- 09:36.000* :  and internet and phone services have now mostly been cut. Just before that shut down our South Asia
*09:36.000- 09:40.940* :  Regional Editor Ambrassaneti Rajan managed to get hold of a Minister Muhammad Ali Arifat.
*09:41.580- 09:46.560* :  He denied reports that the military had used excessive levels of force against the protesters
*09:46.560- 09:52.660* :  at the TV station. From the government side there hasn't been any order given to open fire.
*09:52.920- 09:58.420* :  That's why the government's all the law enforcement agencies showed restraint other than
*09:58.460- 10:05.240* :  non-little weapon. No approval was given to open fire or something but they have planned it.
*10:05.320- 10:11.060* :  This is also not the students at all. They're all the group of extremists put together and they
*10:11.060- 10:15.800* :  planned it so that in a way so that they can capture the BTV and take control over it.
*10:16.080- 10:20.400* :  There are some students they also join. That's why the government rest showed restraint.
*10:20.400- 10:26.200* :  Our objective was to let the student fully go out of it and we'll go on hardline because now we are
*10:27.320- 10:33.720* :  going hardline onto the real terrorists. Those were not the students. So you're saying that if
*10:33.720- 10:39.420* :  they don't leave the building the police will storm the building. Yes, yes absolutely. What would
*10:39.420- 10:43.620* :  you do in your country? They will send a cautionary message and they'll go for action. It's not
*10:43.620- 10:49.040* :  going to be unprovoked. But many of the protesters say it's the security forces that are to blame for
*10:49.040- 10:54.480* :  the escalation of violence. The demonstrators, many of them students, are calling for reform of
*10:54.480- 10:59.440* :  the new rules that reserve a third of highly sought after government jobs for the relatives of
*10:59.440- 11:04.000* :  war heroes who fought for the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971.
*11:05.020- 11:09.560* :  Zaiber is an aspiring law student who's joined the calls for the quotas to be abolished.
*11:09.560- 11:16.640* :  She's had to leave her university because of the clashes. It has been a brutal experience. I have
*11:16.640- 11:24.200* :  never faced something like this in my entire life. We were peacefully protesting but in our
*11:24.200- 11:30.420* :  very own campus we are attacked by Bangladesh Hattori wing of the current ruling party.
*11:31.140- 11:35.560* :  They attacked on our heads and the administration was there. The police was there. No one
*11:35.560- 11:41.380* :  helped us. And then more than 500 armed police confronted us with rubber bullets and tear gas.
*11:42.080- 11:48.180* :  Even they raided our dormitories. They forced us all to leave our own campus.
*11:49.380- 11:51.640* :  We got more from Ambrassan S. Eurasian.
*11:52.260- 11:57.620* :  Now various internet monitoring groups say that internet activity across Bangladesh has come
*11:57.620- 12:05.100* :  down by nearly 90%. In fact, I was talking with the same minister before the line went down to
*12:05.100- 12:10.460* :  learn more about the number of people killed. In fact, the line got disconnected and I tried for
*12:10.460- 12:16.160* :  a couple of hours. I couldn't get through. But a few minutes ago, I spoke to one Bangladesh
*12:17.020- 12:22.200* :  journalist on the normal telephone line. So the telephone line seems to be working even though
*12:22.200- 12:27.580* :  it is very, very difficult to get through. What people are worried about is what will happen during
*12:27.580- 12:33.800* :  this near information blackout, whether the government will go for a crackdown or will it
*12:34.180- 12:39.880* :  reduce the intensity of the protest because most of the student protesters or the movement,
*12:39.880- 12:45.100* :  they have been using internet, like using social media, like Facebook and Twitter to organize
*12:45.100- 12:50.260* :  themselves. Now, that ability is gone, whether this will weaken the protest. That's what we are
*12:50.260- 12:56.020* :  going to see. But very difficult to find information at this point from Bangladesh itself.
*12:56.020- 13:01.100* :  There have been pitched battles between security forces and student protesters. And there are
*13:01.100- 13:05.840* :  conflicting reports about the number of people killed. But the numbers are likely to go up
*13:05.840- 13:12.480* :  than what you mentioned earlier. So it is a really, really a testing time for many Bangladeshes.
*13:13.500- 13:18.660* :  And both sides are blaming each other for the violence with the number of deaths now reported
*13:18.660- 13:23.300* :  to be rising quite rapidly. What do we know about who's to blame?
*13:25.520- 13:31.460* :  Now, the protests started weeks ago as a peaceful movement, where they were asking the government
*13:31.460- 13:38.080* :  to abolish this quota system for government jobs because 30% of the jobs were reserved for what
*13:38.080- 13:43.940* :  they call war heroes. Those who took part in the 1971 independence war with Pakistan.
*13:44.580- 13:49.480* :  But now, the unemployment is high, according to the student activists, especially youth unemployment.
*13:49.480- 13:55.600* :  But then in the last few days, things have changed what the student movement to the leaders
*13:55.600- 14:01.600* :  are blaming police, as well as the student wing of the governing awami league for initiating
*14:01.600- 14:05.740* :  this violence. On the other hand, the minister, whom I spoke to earlier, he was saying that
*14:05.740- 14:11.280* :  the opposition activists, some of the Islamist groups, they have infiltrated this protest movement
*14:11.280- 14:18.760* :  and they were responsible for the violence. But what we know is hundreds of people have been injured
*14:19.200- 14:23.780* :  and we see so many people have been killed and doctors say some of them had rubber bullet injuries.
*14:23.780- 14:29.080* :  So both sides are blaming each other. In the meantime, the casualty figure is going up.
*14:30.020- 14:34.980* :  I'm Russan Eterogen. The authorities in Australia have seized a collection of more than
*14:34.980- 14:41.440* :  3,000 bird eggs from a house in Tasmania. Many are thought to be from rare and endangered birds,
*14:41.900- 14:48.620* :  and as Rachel Wright reports, the trade in eggs is becoming as lucrative as it is destructive.
*14:50.040- 14:55.540* :  Swift parrots heard here in the wild in southeast Australia are one of the rarest species on earth.
*14:55.960- 15:02.860* :  Some experts estimate there are only 3 to 500 left, so breeding them is obviously crucial to
*15:02.860- 15:08.960* :  their survival. But Swift parrots eggs are among more than 3,000 from a range of bird species
*15:09.440- 15:16.220* :  to be allegedly taken from birds nest in Australia. Egg collecting has been a pastime since the 1800s,
*15:16.460- 15:23.500* :  right up to the 1960s, but now it is illegal. Dr Sally Bryant is an ecologist who lives and works
*15:23.500- 15:27.180* :  in Australia. She spoke to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
*15:53.540- 15:58.560* :  The eggs were found in a home in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, the island of the southern
*15:58.560- 16:05.040* :  tip of Australia. The hall is estimated to be worth over 300,000 US dollars on the black market.
*16:05.040- 16:11.220* :  A 62-year-old man is being investigated for allegedly collecting harvesting and trading the eggs.
*16:11.220- 16:16.180* :  The eggs in the collection were all blown or hollowed. The Australian authorities were
*16:16.180- 16:21.760* :  tipped off by a European operation that led to more than 56,000 eggs being seized,
*16:22.220- 16:27.020* :  environmental and wildlife crime has become one of the world's largest and most profitable
*16:27.020- 16:33.340* :  crime sectors worth billions of dollars, and as it continues to grow, it pushes many species
*16:33.340- 16:37.480* :  to the brink of extinction. Dr Eric Wola is a bird ecologist.
*16:38.320- 16:43.900* :  As a species becomes critically endangered, so does the value of their eggs become more and
*16:43.900- 16:48.520* :  more valued. And so there's an even greater incentive to go and collect these eggs before they
*16:48.520- 16:53.600* :  become extinct, just reinforces just how catastrophic this egg collection process is.
*16:54.380- 16:59.360* :  An international agreement has been signed between governments in 180 countries to protect
*16:59.360- 17:04.440* :  endangered plants and animals. The possession of banned specimens, including eggs,
*17:04.780- 17:10.980* :  can carry a penalty of five years imprisonment, a fine of $330,000 or both.
*17:12.020- 17:17.980* :  Rachel Wright. A court in Milan has ordered a journalist to pay more than $5,000 in damages
*17:17.980- 17:23.520* :  to Italy's Prime Minister, Georgia Maloney. Not for comparing her to Mussolini,
*17:23.520- 17:30.680* :  Italy's World War II fascist dictator, although they did, but for mocking her height on social media.
*17:31.280- 17:37.780* :  Paul Moss reports. Would you rather be compared to a fascist or have your height underestimated?
*17:37.780- 17:42.660* :  A court in Italy seems to have decided that shortness is the more serious allegation.
*17:42.660- 17:48.520* :  The Italian journalist Julia Cortese tweeted a mocked-up photograph of the country's Prime Minister.
*17:49.020- 17:53.280* :  It showed Georgia Maloney alongside the late dictator Benito Mussolini.
*17:53.280- 17:57.920* :  Miss Maloney said she would sue. At which point the journalist tweeted back,
*17:57.920- 18:04.360* :  you don't scare me. After all, you're only 1.2 meters tall. I can't even see you.
*18:04.820- 18:10.660* :  Now, Miss Maloney is below average height, but not that small. And a court in Milan on Thursday
*18:10.660- 18:17.340* :  ordered the journalist to pay more than $5,000 compensation to Miss Maloney for body-shaming her.
*18:17.820- 18:21.860* :  However, the court ruled that the Mussolini photograph was not libelous.
*18:22.240- 18:27.040* :  There is precedent here. Miss Maloney is taking action against the singer of the rock band
*18:27.040- 18:33.300* :  placebo for calling her a racist. And she successfully sued a writer who used a mildly offensive
*18:33.300- 18:39.140* :  term of abuse because of her immigration policies. Campaigners accuse the Italian government of
*18:39.140- 18:44.860* :  trying to gag critics. Miss Cortese said she was working in a climate of persecution.

*18:48.720- 18:49.820* :  Still to come on this podcast?
*18:49.820- 18:54.900* :  I had a kind of a strange theory of accountancy. I had always felt, you know,
*18:54.920- 19:01.060* :  if you got within two or three bucks of it, but there's never really caught up.
*19:02.300- 19:07.040* :  The American comedy legend, Bob Newhart, who starred in Elf from the Big Bang Theory,
*19:07.520- 19:09.460* :  has died at the age of 94.

*20:30.680- 20:32.700* :  You're listening to the Global News podcast.
*20:33.440- 20:38.180* :  Here in Britain, a public inquiry into the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic
*20:38.180- 20:44.640* :  has delivered a damning first report highlighting numerous mistakes in the UK's emergency planning.
*20:45.260- 20:48.920* :  The inquiry's chairwoman said the then government had failed its citizens.
*20:49.740- 20:54.300* :  And the pandemic had caused more deaths and economic damage than it should have.
*20:54.920- 21:01.700* :  More than 235,000 people in the UK died with the virus up until the end of last year.
*21:02.220- 21:04.600* :  Here's our health correspondent, Sophie Hutchinson.
*21:05.480- 21:10.920* :  After many weeks of evidence from nearly 70 witnesses and more than 100,000 documents,
*21:10.920- 21:14.900* :  the COVID inquiries first report is unflinchingly critical.
*21:14.900- 21:21.320* :  It said citizens were failed because the UK had been ill prepared for dealing with catastrophic
*21:21.320- 21:27.440* :  emergencies. The inquiry's chair, Baroness Heather Hallett, said there had been a belief that
*21:27.440- 21:31.140* :  the UK was one of the most prepared nations in the world for a pandemic.
*21:31.680- 21:37.420* :  This belief was dangerously mistaken. The UK prepared for the wrong pandemic.
*21:38.400- 21:42.520* :  The significant risk of an influenza pandemic had long been considered,
*21:42.920- 21:44.500* :  written about, and planned for.
*21:45.400- 21:50.520* :  However, that preparedness was inadequate for a global pandemic of the kind that struck.
*21:51.080- 21:55.480* :  The inquiry's report highlighted what it said was a flawed approach to risk assessment
*21:55.480- 22:00.700* :  for a UK-wide emergency, a failure to learn from past outbreaks of disease,
*22:00.700- 22:06.600* :  a narrow range of scientific advice offered up to ministers, and their failure to challenge
*22:06.600- 22:12.780* :  that advice. It also pointed to a damaging absence of focus on the measures and infrastructure
*22:12.780- 22:19.360* :  needed to deal with a fast spreading disease, and a major flaw it said was the lack of a system
*22:19.360- 22:25.760* :  that could be scaled up to test, trace, and isolate people. Naomi Fulop, whose mother died during
*22:25.760- 22:30.900* :  the pandemic, read a statement from the COVID-19-berieved families for justice campaign.
*22:30.900- 22:37.000* :  She praised the report as hard-hitting and clear-sighted, but felt it could have gone further.
*22:37.500- 22:41.580* :  While the inquiry has diagnosed much of what undermined our response,
*22:42.520- 22:46.880* :  Lady Hallett hasn't gone far enough in setting out how we can challenge
*22:46.880- 22:54.340* :  address and improve inequalities and capacity of public services as opposed to just
*22:54.340- 22:59.540* :  understanding the effects of these failures. The inquiry will begin hearing evidence again in
*22:59.540- 23:05.980* :  September about the NHS. Its second report is expected to be published next year and will focus
*23:06.340- 23:12.040* :  on the political decisions taken. Sophie Hutchinson, staying with the issue of health,
*23:12.040- 23:17.620* :  scientists are warning that millions of lives are at risk unless urgent action is taken to stop
*23:17.620- 23:22.100* :  drug-resistant malaria spreading in Africa. Dominic Hughes reports.
*23:23.140- 23:28.800* :  Writing in the journal Science, 28 leading malaria scientists from 10 countries make a series
*23:28.800- 23:33.640* :  of recommendations targeting both the parasite and the mosquitoes that spread the disease,
*23:34.180- 23:39.500* :  including adding a third drug to the Artemisinin combination therapy to make it harder for
*23:39.500- 23:44.160* :  the parasite to evolve resistance. When the malaria parasite developed resistance to a
*23:44.160- 23:49.640* :  previous drug, Plora Queen, in East Africa in the 1970s, malaria deaths on the continent
*23:49.640- 23:55.980* :  trebled to 1.6 million by 2004. Experts say that if the current therapy fails,
*23:55.980- 24:01.700* :  then deaths will rise again. Dominic Hughes. A revered figure in France,
*24:01.720- 24:06.700* :  the Roman Catholic priest, Abe Pierre, remembered fondly as a champion of the homeless,
*24:06.700- 24:14.320* :  has been accused of sexual assault 17 years after his death. He died in 2007 at the age of 94.
*24:15.140- 24:19.980* :  His own charity has made the accusations based on the testimonies of seven women who said they
*24:19.980- 24:26.460* :  were sexually assaulted or harassed by the cleric in the later years of his life, even up until his 90s,
*24:26.900- 24:35.020* :  between 1970 and 2005. So how big a deal are these revelations about Abe Pierre for the French?
*24:35.020- 24:41.040* :  A question for our Paris correspondent, Husco Field. A very, very big deal and his name is still
*24:41.040- 24:47.120* :  has resonance in the country. There are still a chain of charities around the country which do
*24:47.120- 24:53.440* :  good works. It's where people take their old furniture, which is then sold on to raise money for
*24:53.440- 24:59.660* :  housing, for reinsertion of prisoners and poor people and people with drug problems into
*24:59.660- 25:06.820* :  society, into jobs and so on. It's an immense sort of operation, this charity, which owes its name
*25:06.820- 25:12.480* :  to him. It's called the Abe Pierre Foundation and he was its founder. His story goes back to the 50s
*25:12.480- 25:18.180* :  just after the war. When they were terrible problems of housing in a different nature, he was a left
*25:18.180- 25:24.960* :  wing priest basically who used his devotion to God to further social action in a way which was
*25:24.960- 25:29.880* :  very effective and captured the imagination of the country and over and over again he was
*25:29.880- 25:35.700* :  pronounced the most popular Frenchman ever and I think the fact that he was a cleric and on
*25:35.700- 25:40.500* :  the left meant that everyone could identify with him and undoubtedly he did a lot of good
*25:40.500- 25:46.220* :  which of course is why this story now is so shocking for people. It sounds as if he had an
*25:46.220- 25:53.600* :  almost saintly reputation. Well yes he did, he did. The revelations which have come out reveal a
*25:53.600- 26:01.700* :  very very traumatic experience for the women involved. We're not talking about rape, we're talking
*26:01.700- 26:09.080* :  about touches and forced kisses in one case but mainly touching and completely inappropriate
*26:09.080- 26:15.600* :  behaviour. It was all the more traumatic for these women it seems to me because of the man who
*26:15.600- 26:21.320* :  was behind him and of course it made it all harder also for them at the time to say anything about
*26:21.420- 26:25.300* :  it and now it has come out I mean the opposite of the country is very shocked but on the other hand
*26:25.920- 26:30.760* :  one can't pretend this is kind of out of the blue I mean you know there's there is context for all
*26:30.760- 26:37.180* :  of this. And the charities are not in any way denying the women's claims. Oh and absolutely not
*26:37.180- 26:42.460* :  absolutely not no no no no this is you know he died a good one I guess 17 years ago but his name
*26:42.460- 26:47.520* :  is still you know revered in between then and now of course you know a lot has changed in the world
*26:47.580- 26:53.380* :  of attitudes towards sexual inappropriate sexual behaviour from men towards women. I mean what's
*26:53.380- 26:59.180* :  interesting for example is the woman who first brought this to the attention of the authorities
*26:59.180- 27:05.540* :  of the church and at the ABPF Foundation you know she was back in the late 70s early 80s she was
*27:05.540- 27:11.380* :  touched by him he touched her breast he tried to kiss her she called her father in and the father
*27:11.380- 27:16.720* :  gave him a dressing down back then but that was as far as it went you know and as far as the family
*27:16.720- 27:21.340* :  was concerned then that was that and it was only now you know many years later when the woman is
*27:21.540- 27:25.580* :  you know advanced in years she feels able to put this in the context of everything else that's
*27:25.580- 27:30.200* :  happened in in the world ever since and that in much more open approach there is now to this kind
*27:30.200- 27:36.240* :  of inappropriate behaviour and so no one's trying to cover it up absolutely not but I mean it
*27:36.240- 27:40.700* :  but it is a shock for the staff of the foundation and for the the people who work for the charity
*27:40.700- 27:45.480* :  who now have to come terms with you know this saint who's not quite such a saint.
*27:46.420- 27:51.960* :  He used to go field speaking to Paul Henley. The American journalist Evan Gershkiewicz has
*27:51.960- 27:57.020* :  appeared in court in Russia as part of his trial on espionage charges. The Wall Street Journal
*27:57.020- 28:02.140* :  reporter was arrested last year for spying which he denies. Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg
*28:02.140- 28:07.500* :  was outside the courtroom. We weren't allowed into the courtroom today to see Evan Gershkiewicz
*28:07.500- 28:13.600* :  proceedings are behind closed doors but it feels like this case what the Wall Street Journal
*28:13.600- 28:19.780* :  has denounced as a sham trial will soon be over. It's certainly speeding up. Today's hearing
*28:19.780- 28:25.480* :  the second has been brought forward unexpectedly by three and a half weeks and tomorrow's session
*28:25.480- 28:31.180* :  begins with closing arguments. The American journalist his employer and the US government
*28:31.180- 28:37.260* :  fiercely reject accusations that he's a spy. Mr Gershkiewicz is expected to be convicted
*28:37.980- 28:44.180* :  but Moscow has indicated it would be open to doing a deal to release him. The Russians barely hide
*28:44.180- 28:50.520* :  the fact that they view a jailed American as currency, a bargaining chip, an opportunity to
*28:50.520- 28:57.900* :  extract one of their own from a foreign jail. Steve Rosenberg. The legendary American comedian
*28:57.900- 29:05.160* :  and star Bob Newhart has died at the age of 94. The former accountant rose to fame in the 1960s
*29:05.160- 29:11.340* :  with a then-new style of comedy conversational with a slight stammer and observational with a
*29:11.340- 29:17.640* :  deadpan delivery. He became known to later generations for his roles in films like ELF and sitcoms
*29:17.640- 29:22.140* :  like The Big Bang Theory. David Salito looks back at his life and career.
*29:25.180- 29:30.120* :  February 1960 and a 30-year-old accountant who never performed in front of a live audience
*29:30.120- 29:34.920* :  recorded a comedy show in Texas. All right you want you want to start the car?
*29:36.760- 29:39.200* :  Mrs. Webby just turned on the lights. You want to start the car?
*29:39.900- 29:45.520* :  One of Bob Newhart's routines was the driving instructor. All right let's pull out into traffic.
*29:46.120- 29:49.160* :  Now what's the first thing we're going to do before we pull out into traffic?
*29:50.060- 29:56.640* :  Well I mean besides praying let's say. No what I had in mind was checking the rear view mirror.
*29:57.140- 29:59.440* :  You see we always want to check the rear. Don't pull out!
*30:01.740- 30:10.580* :  I'm sorry but there was this fuss. Not only did it become the first comedy record to go to
*30:10.580- 30:16.640* :  number one it stayed there for 14 weeks and one Grammy record of the year beating Frank Sinatra
*30:17.020- 30:22.600* :  and that King Cole. Actually what physically happens with an audience they will applaud because
*30:22.620- 30:27.960* :  they have supplied the unheard portion of the conversation so they're kind of applauding
*30:27.960- 30:33.060* :  themselves. That's the way now let's record some turns. In an era of slick comedians and rapid fire
*30:33.060- 30:38.340* :  jokes Bob Newhart's slight stammer and polite bewilderment rather stood out.
*30:38.740- 30:43.440* :  Now that was fine. One little thing this is a one way street.
*30:44.920- 30:48.620* :  He went on to have two successful sitcoms and starred in a number of movies.
*30:48.620- 30:55.340* :  In Elf he brought typical deadpan Newhart wit to his role of adopted father of an overly large
*30:55.340- 31:01.160* :  elf. You're not like the rest of us. I was sure when you cracked six feet that it would come up.
*31:03.020- 31:08.340* :  And even well into his 80s he was a popular and recurring character in another prime time comedy
*31:08.340- 31:15.240* :  hits The Big Bang Theory. Professor Proton it's an honor to meet you. Is he dangerous?
*31:16.840- 31:22.260* :  He was he said a terrible accountant. I had a kind of a strange theory of accountancy.
*31:23.560- 31:26.960* :  I had always felt you know if you got within two or three bucks of it.
*31:29.660- 31:35.960* :  But there's never really caught on. Accountancy's loss was comedy's game.
*31:37.300- 31:38.080* :  David's little.
*31:40.900- 31:45.480* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later.

*32:18.300- 32:23.460* :  We all know what that music means. It's time for the Olympics in Harris.
