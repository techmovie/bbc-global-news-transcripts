*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?

*01:24.680- 01:29.820* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway and we're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Monday, the 1st of July.
*01:30.240- 01:32.660* :  Is the far right about to take power in France?
*01:33.260- 01:39.140* :  Our party is not the monster. It has been presented as the fact that we love our country.
*01:39.140- 01:41.500* :  Does not mean that we hate others.
*01:42.120- 01:47.960* :  But President Macron is calling for centrist and left-wing parties to unite against the National Rally
*01:48.280- 01:50.220* :  in the second round of voting next Sunday.
*01:51.020- 01:54.300* :  It was the earliest category for hurricane ever recorded.
*01:54.300- 01:57.180* :  Now Storm Barrel is taking aim at the Caribbean.
*01:58.000- 02:01.640* :  And the US Justice Department has accused of offering Boeing a sweet heart deal
*02:02.160- 02:05.340* :  over fatal 737 Max airline crashes.
*02:07.760- 02:12.680* :  Also in the podcast, we hear about the Sudanese children fleeing the conflict in Darfur.
*02:13.020- 02:15.820* :  We suffer a lot because of the security situation.
*02:16.780- 02:19.400* :  Now, I believe I'm in a safe place.
*02:19.620- 02:24.560* :  Even for my pupils, they can't get a good education if they don't feel safe.
*02:25.240- 02:28.460* :  We look back at the life of the Albanian writer Anne Poet,
*02:28.500- 02:31.880* :  his maillot Cadare, who's died at the age of 88,
*02:32.760- 02:35.540* :  and an admission charge to climb Mount Fuji.
*02:40.240- 02:43.920* :  But first, one thing that's clear, after the first round of the French election,
*02:43.920- 02:48.680* :  the far right is now closer to power than at any time since the Second World War.
*02:49.160- 02:53.820* :  Marine Le Pen's Rassomblant National won a third of the vote on Sunday.
*02:53.820- 02:57.280* :  And as campaigning gets underway for the second round next weekend,
*02:57.300- 03:01.900* :  President Macron has called for centrist and left-wing blocks to join forces
*03:02.260- 03:04.440* :  to stop the far right winning control of Parliament.
*03:05.200- 03:08.840* :  So what does France make of the results so far? Here's the view from Paris.
*03:10.980- 03:13.180* :  It's scary. The far right is a bit of a shock.
*03:13.180- 03:16.880* :  It's a bit difficult for young people that there's a party who's in the lead
*03:16.880- 03:21.120* :  who cares very little about us. We're wondering whether others feel the same way.
*03:21.740- 03:24.520* :  Do other young people feel the same way? It's a bit difficult.
*03:25.860- 03:29.100* :  What do I think? A bit disappointed in France, actually.
*03:29.100- 03:33.200* :  It's not the France that I near as a child, but now that's how it is.
*03:33.400- 03:35.420* :  That's what happens. It's chaos and facts.
*03:37.640- 03:41.680* :  National rally candidate, Ivanka Dimitrovert, says the party wants to
*03:41.680- 03:45.400* :  unify all the people of France as long as they live like the French.
*03:45.860- 03:52.720* :  I think the work that we have started a long time ago has given its first results.
*03:52.980- 03:58.520* :  We are convincing people that our party is not the monster.
*03:59.100- 04:04.340* :  It has been presented as that the fact that we love our country and our people
*04:04.340- 04:08.600* :  does not mean that we hate others, not at all.
*04:09.120- 04:12.540* :  Our Paris correspondent Yusko Field told us more about how people in France
*04:12.540- 04:14.900* :  have reacted to the national rallies success.
*04:15.460- 04:18.320* :  They're not surprised because the polls said this was coming.
*04:18.320- 04:22.100* :  It's come. No one can say that there wasn't any forewarning.
*04:22.440- 04:25.940* :  Nonetheless, there is a sense of us moving into new terrain,
*04:25.940- 04:32.220* :  and that requires a sense of adapting your brain to a new reality.
*04:32.220- 04:35.440* :  Among many people, particularly in the big cities like Paris,
*04:35.920- 04:38.480* :  there's absolute dismay and anger.
*04:38.800- 04:42.660* :  But let's not forget, Paris and the other big cities are not France,
*04:42.700- 04:45.420* :  and it's quite clear that outside of the big cities,
*04:45.420- 04:50.540* :  the national rally is hugely popular, and there people are no doubt saying,
*04:50.540- 04:52.560* :  well, things are moving our way.
*04:52.560- 04:58.980* :  What is clear and what unites everyone is a feeling that France is on the verge of
*04:58.980- 05:00.780* :  some major change, political change,
*05:00.780- 05:04.940* :  though what that change will be hasn't been determined.
*05:04.940- 05:08.700* :  There is another round of this election, and a lot hinges on that second round
*05:08.980- 05:12.780* :  because it will make the difference between a national rally government
*05:12.780- 05:15.140* :  with a absolute majority and us able to govern.
*05:15.140- 05:18.700* :  And one that has no majority or only a relative majority
*05:18.700- 05:21.100* :  and is thus unable to do anything in Parliament,
*05:21.100- 05:23.760* :  which means a whole new set of problems in the country.
*05:24.100- 05:29.960* :  Yeah, I mean, let's look at how things will pan out next weekend.
*05:31.160- 05:32.660* :  The national rally got about a third of the vote.
*05:32.660- 05:35.580* :  That means two-thirds of people didn't vote for them.
*05:35.580- 05:38.060* :  Will they be able to join forces because you've got the centrist,
*05:38.060- 05:41.120* :  but then also this new popular fronter on the left,
*05:41.120- 05:43.300* :  which also has some extreme elements?
*05:43.300- 05:45.260* :  There's the rubbum. We just don't know.
*05:45.620- 05:48.940* :  You look on paper and you think, well, in the natural course of events,
*05:48.940- 05:53.400* :  there's more people who are against the national front than there are people who are for it.
*05:53.880- 05:56.960* :  Therefore, they should be able to keep it out or keep the gains down.
*05:57.480- 06:00.020* :  If this was a presidential election, that would certainly apply,
*06:00.020- 06:03.020* :  and we'd at least certainly apply in the past.
*06:03.080- 06:05.480* :  And at every presidential election,
*06:05.480- 06:08.520* :  when it's been merely depend against someone else,
*06:08.840- 06:12.340* :  people come together to block the national rally candidate.
*06:12.920- 06:16.280* :  This is a different situation because it's constituency-based.
*06:16.280- 06:19.400* :  There are local candidates with local loyalties and so on.
*06:19.640- 06:22.720* :  And also, the political world is changing.
*06:22.740- 06:27.280* :  People are far, far less reluctant to say openly that they vote for the national rally.
*06:27.280- 06:28.880* :  The normalisation is complete.
*06:29.380- 06:31.280* :  On the left, you have this alliance,
*06:31.280- 06:34.940* :  which includes the party, the LFI, the France Unbound,
*06:34.940- 06:39.580* :  which is, in many people's eyes, also, and totally unpalatable and unacceptable.
*06:40.040- 06:42.140* :  In the Figaro, for example, the Conservatives newspaper,
*06:42.660- 06:45.260* :  for the first time they had an editorial today saying that
*06:45.560- 06:48.980* :  LFI, the left, the far left, is worse than the far right.
*06:48.980- 06:53.280* :  So, effectively saying, if we have to choose, we will choose the far right.
*06:53.280- 06:54.220* :  And that's new.
*06:54.860- 06:56.300* :  Cusco filled in Paris.
*06:56.660- 07:01.680* :  The national rally has said it wants to combat what it calls Islamist ideologies,
*07:01.960- 07:05.400* :  and would like to change the law to make it easier to close mosques
*07:05.400- 07:07.080* :  and ban the Muslim headscarf.
*07:07.760- 07:10.780* :  One in ten adults in France identifies as Muslim.
*07:10.780- 07:14.580* :  Rob Young has been gauging opinion on the rise of the national rally
*07:14.900- 07:17.620* :  and its policies at a mosque in northern France.
*07:27.260- 07:30.360* :  The call to prayer by the Imam signals the start of the name
*07:30.580- 07:35.600* :  worship hundreds of men and women have streamed into this large mosque outside
*07:35.600- 07:40.220* :  Lille. Their shoes removed and neatly arranged in the corridors.
*07:40.900- 07:43.120* :  Religious duty is the main thing on their minds,
*07:43.120- 07:48.080* :  but there's also anxiety about the possibility of a national rally government.
*07:48.880- 07:54.340* :  Here's Nadine, who's an IT engineer and moved to France from Morocco 40 years ago.
*07:54.800- 07:56.200* :  Bien sûr qu'un petit peu d'inquiétude.
*07:56.540- 07:57.700* :  Je suis perdre de quatre enfants.
*07:57.940- 07:58.940* :  Of course, there's some worry.
*07:59.220- 08:00.540* :  I'm a father of four children.
*08:01.080- 08:03.960* :  All my children are educated and taking on higher studies
*08:04.640- 08:06.380* :  as are many people of the Muslim faith.
*08:07.220- 08:10.320* :  Muslims in France are a minority, and within that minority,
*08:10.320- 08:14.560* :  there's perhaps a minority that's a little lost when it comes to education and their future.
*08:15.360- 08:16.880* :  And so there's a focus on these people,
*08:17.120- 08:19.520* :  rather than the 80% of law-abiding Muslims.
*08:20.640- 08:22.500* :  So that creates a feeling of worry in France,
*08:22.500- 08:26.260* :  and the media zooms in on this and incites a far-right electric.
*08:27.620- 08:29.480* :  We'll be watching where things go.
*08:29.600- 08:31.900* :  I think there are a lot of Muslims who will make a decision.
*08:32.520- 08:35.120* :  There's testimony from many highly qualified Muslims
*08:35.180- 08:38.100* :  who are leaving France because the pressure on them is just too much.
*08:39.140- 08:42.140* :  My name is Billel, and I'm 18 years old.
*08:42.360- 08:45.960* :  I'm a little bit worried about the rise of the former national,
*08:45.960- 08:50.740* :  because discrimination they made about Muslim people.
*08:51.220- 08:54.360* :  This is going to be really difficult to a Muslim,
*08:54.360- 08:57.320* :  to live in peace in France,
*08:58.080- 09:00.380* :  if the former national will come to power.
*09:00.820- 09:05.120* :  I love France for many reasons, like it's my country.
*09:05.120- 09:08.300* :  I want to live in France for the rest of my life,
*09:08.680- 09:14.280* :  but if I choice to the religion or the country,
*09:14.680- 09:16.180* :  I'm going to choose my religion.
*09:18.180- 09:20.400* :  In the part of the mosque reserved for women,
*09:20.420- 09:25.400* :  Doctor and mum of three E-men who left Tunisia 18 years ago
*09:25.400- 09:28.580* :  is wearing a black headscarf known as a hijab,
*09:28.960- 09:32.220* :  a garment the national rally wants to ban in public places.
*09:35.620- 09:37.120* :  As a Muslim woman in France,
*09:37.540- 09:40.180* :  there are already difficulties, but they are limited.
*09:41.000- 09:44.680* :  What worries me is new laws like the national rallies promise
*09:45.160- 09:46.880* :  to ban the hijab in public space.
*09:47.660- 09:50.960* :  This is a country we chose, we chose it for its values,
*09:50.960- 09:54.420* :  women rights, its values of inclusion, freedom,
*09:54.420- 09:56.480* :  equality and fatality.
*09:57.040- 09:59.540* :  So having a party like the national rally come to power
*10:00.000- 10:01.540* :  is not what we wanted,
*10:02.340- 10:05.140* :  but this fear won't stop me from living
*10:05.140- 10:08.580* :  and it won't stop me from doing what I want to do
*10:08.960- 10:12.220* :  as a Muslim woman, but also as a French woman.
*10:12.980- 10:15.720* :  Outside the mosque and anti-racism campaigner
*10:15.760- 10:18.540* :  is handing out leaflets urging people to vote.
*10:19.380- 10:22.720* :  This worshiper, Hamid, who was originally from Algeria,
*10:22.900- 10:26.960* :  says he will vote, but insists he isn't scared about the prospect
*10:26.960- 10:28.720* :  of a national rally government.
*10:32.280- 10:34.100* :  It worries me, but it doesn't scare me.
*10:34.700- 10:36.640* :  Worry and fear are not the same thing.
*10:37.440- 10:39.800* :  I think France is already very intolerant anyway,
*10:40.300- 10:43.700* :  and I'm not sure national rally is going to change anything about that.
*10:43.700- 10:45.280* :  The problem already exists.
*10:46.000- 10:48.940* :  Is a national rally going to get rid of all the Muslims in France?
*10:49.320- 10:49.920* :  That's impossible.
*10:50.500- 10:52.800* :  So as a Muslim living in France,
*10:52.800- 10:55.140* :  I will stay here with my wife and my children
*10:55.400- 10:56.820* :  and I will keep my religion.
*10:58.800- 11:02.280* :  People are speaking to Rob Young in Lille in Northern France.
*11:03.360- 11:05.760* :  Beryl, the first named hurricane of the season,
*11:05.760- 11:10.060* :  is now just 125 kilometers or so from the Caribbean Island of Grenada
*11:10.680- 11:13.720* :  and moving at a speed of about 30 kilometers an hour.
*11:14.040- 11:17.780* :  It's Vincent and the Grenadines is also at risk of life-threatening winds
*11:17.880- 11:19.280* :  and a storm surge.
*11:19.880- 11:22.940* :  And the Prime Minister there, Ralph Consars, had this warning.
*11:23.400- 11:27.540* :  Hurricane Beryl is moving toward the west, not west.
*11:28.820- 11:33.780* :  Don't risk going to see take up your boat, pull up your boat.
*11:34.700- 11:39.440* :  We have to prepare, organize and waste this monster out.
*11:40.100- 11:42.320* :  As the hurricane moved towards the Windward Islands,
*11:42.320- 11:44.660* :  I spoke to Chris Forks from BBC Weather.
*11:45.020- 11:48.060* :  Hurricane Beryl has sustained winds of 120 miles an hour,
*11:48.060- 11:50.720* :  which is 195 kilometers an hour, but it's stronger gusts.
*11:51.020- 11:53.800* :  The gusts are reaching around 145 miles an hour,
*11:53.800- 11:55.900* :  which is 235 kilometers an hour.
*11:56.460- 11:59.600* :  Now the thing with hurricanes is the really fierce winds
*11:59.940- 12:03.360* :  tend to be quite low-closed around the eye of the storm.
*12:03.800- 12:06.900* :  And so if you travel 30 miles outside of the eye,
*12:07.380- 12:10.020* :  then the winds drop off quite dramatically below 70 miles an hour,
*12:10.020- 12:14.200* :  for example, below about 110 km an hour or around about that speed.
*12:14.720- 12:18.900* :  Now I think one of the things with Beryl is it's moving quite quickly forward.
*12:19.340- 12:21.840* :  So it's moving at a forward speed of about 20 miles an hour,
*12:22.280- 12:24.800* :  and the only good thing I'd say about that is it doesn't allow
*12:24.800- 12:28.280* :  enormous rainfall totals to build up because it moves through quite quickly.
*12:28.820- 12:32.740* :  And so we're looking at something like 100 to 250 millimetres of rain.
*12:33.100- 12:36.160* :  It's still enough to cause some significant even some severe flooding problems,
*12:36.160- 12:39.520* :  but in the grand scheme of hurricanes it could be worse.
*12:39.740- 12:40.960* :  Talking about the grand scheme of hurricanes,
*12:40.960- 12:44.400* :  we're quite early in the season, runs from June to November.
*12:44.880- 12:47.940* :  Beryl, the first category four ever recorded in June.
*12:47.940- 12:49.640* :  And we're also seeing tropical storm,
*12:49.640- 12:52.160* :  Chris forming around Mexico.
*12:52.160- 12:53.720* :  What is in store for this season?
*12:54.340- 12:58.020* :  Well, you're right. This season is expected to be exceptionally busy.
*12:58.020- 12:59.440* :  And there's a few reasons for that.
*12:59.440- 13:01.720* :  You know, if we look at the ocean temperatures
*13:02.340- 13:05.980* :  around the planet, we've had 13 consecutive months of not just
*13:05.980- 13:09.700* :  up of average temperatures, but of record temperatures.
*13:10.120- 13:13.660* :  And it's the heats that in the oceans that actually powers these hurricanes.
*13:13.660- 13:14.780* :  So that's one factor.
*13:15.380- 13:18.340* :  The other is actually, you know, you might have heard about El Nino landing
*13:18.340- 13:19.140* :  in your kind of patterns.
*13:19.520- 13:20.920* :  We had El Nino last year.
*13:21.120- 13:24.400* :  And one thing with hurricanes is they don't like strong winds around them.
*13:24.780- 13:26.720* :  It kind of disturbs the circulation.
*13:27.200- 13:30.200* :  And so in El Nino years, you find that you don't often get very many
*13:30.200- 13:31.140* :  Atlantic hurricanes.
*13:31.140- 13:35.360* :  So last year, relatively quiet, this year we're coming away from that.
*13:35.360- 13:36.780* :  We're in a neutral pattern at the moment.
*13:36.780- 13:39.440* :  And we're heading towards a La Niña pattern.
*13:39.900- 13:43.240* :  And that also increases the likelihood of storm.
*13:43.240- 13:44.900* :  So in terms of the season as a whole,
*13:45.340- 13:47.620* :  this year, we're expecting eight to 13 hurricanes.
*13:47.620- 13:49.320* :  An average season would bring us seven.
*13:49.760- 13:53.780* :  And of those hurricanes, we're expecting around four to seven major hurricanes.
*13:54.280- 13:55.100* :  The average is three.
*13:55.520- 13:57.540* :  So, barrel, the first major hurricane,
*13:58.240- 14:01.400* :  in what is expected to be an incredibly busy season.
*14:01.880- 14:03.780* :  Chris Forks, and since I spoke to Chris,
*14:03.780- 14:08.100* :  hurricane barrel has regained strength into a category four hurricane
*14:08.640- 14:12.560* :  with maximum sustained winds of 215 kilometers an hour.
*14:13.500- 14:16.100* :  It's been called a sweetheart plea deal.
*14:16.260- 14:19.320* :  Lawyers for the families of those who died in two plane crashes.
*14:19.860- 14:23.720* :  So the aircraft manufacturer Boeing will be ordered to pay a fine
*14:23.720- 14:26.000* :  of just $240 million.
*14:26.260- 14:33.120* :  346 people died in the 737 max crashes in 2018 and 2019.
*14:33.120- 14:36.980* :  The families are not happy about the agreement from the U.S. Department of Justice
*14:36.980- 14:39.980* :  as I heard from our business, Coras Spondent, Nick Marsh.
*14:40.560- 14:43.520* :  Yeah, well, we've been in touch, Ollie, with Paul Kassel,
*14:43.520- 14:48.160* :  who's the lawyer that's representing 15 families of the victims of those plane crashes.
*14:48.840- 14:52.840* :  And he said that the DOJ is offering this deal to Boeing,
*14:52.840- 14:58.820* :  whereby it will plead guilty to fraud face that fine that you mentioned.
*14:58.820- 15:02.940* :  He calls it a small fine and a three-year probationary period.
*15:02.940- 15:06.520* :  In that way, Boeing avoids going to trial and admitting
*15:06.520- 15:11.460* :  that it was directly responsible for those 346 deaths.
*15:12.200- 15:12.960* :  That's the deal.
*15:13.820- 15:14.980* :  That's supposedly on the table.
*15:14.980- 15:18.440* :  We've had no comment from Boeing, all the Department of Justice, yet.
*15:19.080- 15:21.920* :  That's what he and the lawyers are saying to us.
*15:22.420- 15:26.300* :  Paul Kassel said he's been told that directly by DOJ officials, and that's the plan.
*15:26.820- 15:30.120* :  I'll just back up a little bit, Ollie, and just explain the timeline of how we got here.
*15:30.120- 15:38.060* :  Because in 2021, Boeing promised the DOJ it would improve its safety culture and its ethics.
*15:38.680- 15:44.340* :  In the aftermath of those 737 crashes, and in return, it would avoid criminal charges.
*15:44.340- 15:46.880* :  It also paid a $2.5 billion fine there as well.
*15:47.660- 15:52.260* :  Now, as we know, in the intervening times since, there's been an awful lot of incidents.
*15:52.260- 15:55.560* :  You know, the door coming off the Alaska Airlines flight, whistleblowers,
*15:56.020- 15:59.520* :  you know, saying that corners are being cut when it comes to safety and so on.
*15:59.940- 16:03.640* :  So the DOJ is basically saying, look, Boeing has broken that agreement.
*16:03.640- 16:05.140* :  Improvements have not been made.
*16:05.480- 16:08.520* :  So we're going to charge them with fraud for breaking that agreement.
*16:09.160- 16:15.140* :  But with this option of a plea deal, and I clearly that's not gone down well with the families.
*16:15.500- 16:19.240* :  Yeah, tell us more about how they are likely to react to this.
*16:20.760- 16:25.440* :  So we've been told that they will strenuously object to this plea.
*16:25.440- 16:26.100* :  That's a quote.
*16:26.100- 16:29.500* :  I mean, it's already been called a sweep heart deal by the lawyers, you know,
*16:29.500- 16:30.940* :  Boeing getting off lightly.
*16:31.300- 16:34.380* :  And even when it comes to the fine, we've had no confirmation.
*16:34.480- 16:38.460* :  But there is that sort of figure of around $250 million ish.
*16:39.120- 16:42.300* :  When you consider that the families are asking for 25 billion,
*16:42.940- 16:46.140* :  you can see how disappointing an outcome this would be for them.
*16:46.540- 16:47.940* :  It's not set in stone like I said.
*16:47.940- 16:50.280* :  We've had no confirmation from Boeing or the DOJ.
*16:50.800- 16:54.120* :  And a judge would still need to approve this plea deal.
*16:54.480- 16:55.840* :  So it's not all finalised.
*16:56.240- 17:00.120* :  But if it does materialise, it would be a very controversial development,
*17:00.120- 17:03.240* :  indeed, foreboding for the families for everyone really.
*17:03.760- 17:05.640* :  Nick Marsh, our business correspondent.
*17:06.400- 17:11.240* :  The Albanian writer and poet Ismail Kaderay has died at the age of 88.
*17:11.940- 17:15.380* :  As the first winner of the International Booker Prize in 2005,
*17:15.380- 17:19.540* :  Kaderay was regarded as one of the most accomplished European writers of our times.
*17:19.540- 17:23.040* :  His works have been translated into more than 45 languages.
*17:23.660- 17:25.360* :  Aryan Kocchi looks back at his life.
*17:25.860- 17:28.700* :  Ismail Kaderay defied simple categorisation.
*17:28.700- 17:33.360* :  For much of his literary career, he was lauded as a potential Nobel Prize winner,
*17:33.360- 17:39.860* :  but also criticised as a sycophant of the Albanian communist dictatorship in the 1960s and 80s.
*17:40.120- 17:43.860* :  His stories are rooted in events and myths of his native Albania,
*17:43.860- 17:48.640* :  but critics say his novels have a timeless relevance and universal appeal.
*17:49.160- 17:52.800* :  Born in 1936 in Jorokaster in Sarvan Albania,
*17:53.120- 17:55.920* :  Kaderay studied literature in Tirana and Moscow.
*17:55.920- 18:01.860* :  His return home in 1960 coincided with Albania's diplomatic rift with the Soviet Union,
*18:02.280- 18:05.060* :  which Kaderay chronicled in his work The Great Winter,
*18:05.500- 18:09.680* :  which has been criticised for praising the communist Albanian leader Enver Hoja.
*18:10.160- 18:12.980* :  Kaderay did not help matters with his honest admission,
*18:13.360- 18:15.380* :  that he never considered himself a dissident,
*18:15.380- 18:18.060* :  insisting he was not a political writer.
*18:18.520- 18:21.420* :  Although he was deeply interested in Albanian politics,
*18:21.420- 18:24.740* :  he took refuge in historical and allegorical fiction.
*18:24.960- 18:27.100* :  His masterpiece, The Palace of Dreams,
*18:27.100- 18:30.840* :  is set in Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire,
*18:30.840- 18:34.680* :  where dreams are scrutinised for science of political unrest.
*18:34.680- 18:39.320* :  It is seen as an allegory of the authoritarian regime's mania for surveillance.
*18:40.040- 18:43.820* :  In awarding him the first international booker prize in 2005
*18:43.820- 18:45.700* :  for his whole body of work,
*18:45.980- 18:49.900* :  the jury described Kaderay as a writer who maps a whole culture,
*18:50.260- 18:54.880* :  a universal writer in the tradition of storytelling that goes back to Homer.
*18:55.300- 18:58.920* :  Aryan Kotsion Ismail Kaderay, who's died at the age of 88.
*19:01.920- 19:04.220* :  And still to come on the global news podcast,
*19:04.220- 19:09.460* :  the pop star who saved the day for football hungry fans at Glastonbury Music Festival.

*19:25.200- 19:28.800* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*19:28.800- 19:32.600* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

*20:24.900- 20:27.100* :  The fighting between rival factions in Sudan
*20:27.100- 20:29.840* :  has forced millions of people, many of them children,
*20:29.840- 20:33.280* :  to flee with huge numbers now living in refugee camps
*20:33.280- 20:35.120* :  across the border in eastern Chad.
*20:35.840- 20:37.920* :  A new school at the Metche camp,
*20:37.920- 20:40.200* :  which hosts over 40,000 people,
*20:40.200- 20:42.060* :  is giving some of the children a chance
*20:42.060- 20:44.580* :  to resume at least a semblance of normal life.
*20:45.240- 20:48.920* :  The BBC's Paul and G.A. travel to Metche to find out more.
*20:53.720- 20:56.240* :  The boy's trust singing of Sudanese children,
*20:56.760- 20:59.480* :  living at the Metche refugee camp in eastern Chad,
*21:00.200- 21:03.020* :  belies the horrors of war that they witnessed
*21:03.160- 21:04.260* :  in the Darfur region.
*21:08.000- 21:10.200* :  They now welcome life in their new school,
*21:10.980- 21:13.840* :  built with tin roofs and flapping tupple in walls.
*21:15.120- 21:18.160* :  Even though the children sit on mats instead of desks
*21:18.160- 21:18.820* :  and benches,
*21:19.560- 21:22.720* :  their enthusiasm to learn remains strong.
*21:27.540- 21:30.680* :  Tajahanan Adam, herself a refugee in the camp,
*21:31.420- 21:34.140* :  takes them through the paces of the day's lesson.
*21:35.240- 21:37.280* :  She relieves the challenges the faced
*21:37.640- 21:39.320* :  when the rebel rapid support forces
*21:39.800- 21:43.220* :  targeted civilians in her native west Darfur state.
*21:45.700- 21:48.560* :  We suffer a lot because of the security situation.
*21:49.520- 21:52.120* :  Now, I believe I'm in a safe place,
*21:52.880- 21:53.840* :  even for my pupils,
*21:54.480- 21:57.280* :  they can't get a good education if they don't feel safe.
*22:00.840- 22:04.100* :  12-year-old Ahmed happily joins in the lesson.
*22:09.360- 22:11.840* :  I spend seven to eight months without education,
*22:11.840- 22:12.980* :  because of war.
*22:13.600- 22:15.180* :  And when I arrived here in Chad,
*22:15.680- 22:17.400* :  I was out of school for months.
*22:18.560- 22:19.720* :  Now I have found this school,
*22:20.040- 22:22.500* :  and I'm very happy because I got new friends.
*22:23.080- 22:24.240* :  I thought I had no future.
*22:25.980- 22:32.140* :  Unfortunately, only 1,800 of the 23,000 children living in the camp
*22:32.680- 22:35.760* :  can attend the new school due to limited resources.
*22:38.940- 22:39.560* :  After school,
*22:40.140- 22:43.880* :  Ahmed takes us home to meet his younger brother, Jamar Aldin,
*22:44.380- 22:46.580* :  who hasn't secured a place in the school.
*22:48.860- 22:50.720* :  The situation is very bad.
*22:51.200- 22:53.980* :  I'm not happy because while my body is in school,
*22:54.260- 22:55.140* :  I am out of school.
*22:55.560- 22:57.320* :  This means my future is not clear.
*23:00.800- 23:03.820* :  The Norwegian refugee council runs the school.
*23:04.800- 23:08.980* :  Shelter officer Isam Adam says the need more support
*23:09.480- 23:10.840* :  to expand the project.
*23:12.320- 23:15.060* :  In Mecha in Loon, we need more than four schools.
*23:15.840- 23:18.320* :  There are about five other camps in eastern Chad,
*23:18.740- 23:19.920* :  also in need of education,
*23:20.840- 23:22.460* :  plus other aspects like shelter.
*23:27.160- 23:30.440* :  For now, the children in Tijohanan's classroom
*23:31.080- 23:34.100* :  keep their dreams of a brighter future alive.
*23:35.680- 23:38.080* :  Paul and G.A. reporting from eastern Chad.
*23:39.040- 23:40.280* :  Over the past 15 years,
*23:40.280- 23:43.260* :  Northeastern Nigeria has faced devastating attacks
*23:43.260- 23:44.600* :  from Islamist militants.
*23:45.120- 23:48.620* :  On Saturday, suicide bombers killed at least 18 people
*23:48.620- 23:51.720* :  and left more than 40 injured in three separate attacks
*23:51.720- 23:54.640* :  in the regional town of Gosa in Borno State.
*23:55.260- 23:57.360* :  The attackers all thought to be women,
*23:57.360- 24:00.220* :  targeted a wedding, a hospital and a funeral.
*24:00.720- 24:03.660* :  Professor Usman Tar Borno State's Commissioner for Information
*24:03.660- 24:07.180* :  and Internal Security told us who they thought were responsible.
*24:07.820- 24:10.200* :  The intelligence available to us indicates
*24:10.200- 24:15.280* :  that the attack was carried out by the Boko Haram terrorist group
*24:15.620- 24:20.660* :  because the government of Borno State is resettling the people of Gosa
*24:20.860- 24:24.860* :  and other villages and they appear not to be happy about that.
*24:25.180- 24:29.040* :  They wanted the Gosa area to be an governed space
*24:29.220- 24:31.800* :  and but Gomen wanted to resettle the people
*24:31.800- 24:33.840* :  and the resettlement plan has gone far.
*24:34.260- 24:37.720* :  So they prepared this attack in order to sabotage
*24:38.140- 24:39.220* :  the effort of the government.
*24:39.220- 24:42.220* :  That is what we can say for now.
*24:42.920- 24:47.040* :  But the fact is terrorists took advantage of a social assembly
*24:47.500- 24:48.800* :  and they were going forward.
*24:48.800- 24:52.780* :  What we would do is to beef up security protocol
*24:52.780- 24:56.280* :  during gatherings to make sure that such an event
*24:56.280- 24:57.400* :  do not take place again.
*24:57.780- 25:00.980* :  The Gomen on his path will work harder than ever before
*25:00.980- 25:03.560* :  in order to make sure that this event does not repeat
*25:04.820- 25:05.480* :  enough is enough.
*25:06.220- 25:08.080* :  Professor Osman Tar in Nigeria.
*25:09.020- 25:12.100* :  With only three days to go before the UK's general election,
*25:12.100- 25:14.600* :  one of the big issues is the price of homes.
*25:15.260- 25:18.120* :  But are any of the political parties able to convince people
*25:18.120- 25:20.600* :  they can solve Britain's housing crunch?
*25:21.140- 25:23.580* :  Leana Burn from Marketplace has been taking a look.
*25:26.500- 25:29.020* :  If you want to understand the UK's housing market right now,
*25:29.020- 25:31.960* :  the best thing to do is go looking to buy a home.
*25:34.280- 25:36.960* :  Maynard Cower is 43 and lives in a small,
*25:36.960- 25:38.380* :  two-bed house in London.
*25:38.840- 25:40.500* :  She's a full-time care for her parents.
*25:40.580- 25:43.220* :  Since her mom was diagnosed with blood cancer,
*25:43.220- 25:45.620* :  she says her family needs more space.
*25:45.620- 25:51.700* :  But she's struggling to find a bigger house within her $770,000 budget.
*25:52.300- 25:54.160* :  That's close to her mom's hospital.
*25:54.620- 25:55.660* :  So how did you feel about that one?
*25:56.280- 25:57.480* :  I didn't like it at all.
*25:57.800- 25:59.320* :  It's no lie, it was really dull.
*25:59.960- 26:00.980* :  Cracks and the walls.
*26:01.500- 26:02.620* :  On the way to our next viewing,
*26:02.620- 26:06.020* :  Minri tells me that she's sick of people telling her to move
*26:06.240- 26:07.400* :  further away from London.
*26:07.760- 26:09.640* :  And do that if it's just yourself.
*26:09.840- 26:12.400* :  When you're in care and you put your parents out in the parents,
*26:13.220- 26:14.260* :  it's just not feasible.
*26:14.740- 26:17.100* :  A conservative party, which is currently in government,
*26:17.140- 26:21.540* :  is promising to waive a home buyer tax for first-time buyers like Minri,
*26:21.540- 26:25.140* :  for properties costing up to $540,000.
*26:25.940- 26:28.680* :  But she's looking in slough, a town to the west of London,
*26:28.680- 26:32.560* :  where average property prices are $570,000.
*26:32.740- 26:34.740* :  So she'll miss out.
*26:35.140- 26:38.080* :  Where are you going to get a house in the area of London?
*26:38.080- 26:39.920* :  You're not going to, you're going to have to move really far.
*26:40.320- 26:42.960* :  At house number two, Minri isn't impressed.
*26:43.620- 26:45.000* :  This one is 5008.
*26:45.300- 26:47.700* :  Well, it also makes sense, it's going to need a lot more.
*26:48.380- 26:52.120* :  The average property price paid by a first-time buyer in the UK last year
*26:52.120- 26:54.520* :  was just over a quarter of a million dollars.
*26:55.040- 26:57.860* :  Private rental costs have gone up by more than 9%
*26:58.020- 27:01.160* :  according to the UK's Office for National Statistics.
*27:01.860- 27:03.860* :  Peter Felix and his partner Rebecca Wilson
*27:04.320- 27:07.780* :  are in their early 40s and have been renting together in the city of Birmingham
*27:07.780- 27:10.020* :  in Mid-England for nearly three years.
*27:10.520- 27:15.840* :  It's quite depressing that you can go out and earn a decent wage
*27:16.720- 27:19.640* :  but not be able to afford to buy a property
*27:19.640- 27:21.640* :  because your money is going towards the rent.
*27:22.060- 27:26.020* :  The opposition Labour Party says it wants to extend an existing scheme
*27:26.020- 27:28.840* :  which helps people get a mortgage with a smaller deposit
*27:29.320- 27:33.140* :  but Peter says saving for a small deposit is challenging.
*27:33.600- 27:36.240* :  The rents are going up and we know that every time they don't go
*27:36.240- 27:38.640* :  it's up it means there's less and less in that pocket to decide.
*27:39.200- 27:41.940* :  Availability of public housing is another issue.
*27:42.260- 27:45.980* :  Labour is promising more but Osman Amadi an Uber driver
*27:45.980- 27:48.620* :  who's been waiting for three years is skeptical
*27:48.660- 27:50.240* :  any change will happen.
*27:50.660- 27:52.860* :  I have seen a lot of people have got all the letters,
*27:52.860- 27:55.540* :  I've got all the proof and nothing's been done.
*27:55.920- 27:58.720* :  Meanwhile Minerita's finished her viewings for the day.
*27:59.100- 28:01.300* :  I just feel so deflated I didn't like that at all.
*28:01.640- 28:03.160* :  This is my biggest issue with the elections.
*28:03.160- 28:06.040* :  I just feel this is all I'm thinking about day in day out
*28:06.040- 28:09.300* :  going round and round in circles and I'm getting ready to press about it.
*28:09.660- 28:12.460* :  According to UK Price Comparison website Money Facts
*28:12.840- 28:16.920* :  people in the UK spend on average more than a quarter of their disposable income
*28:16.920- 28:17.560* :  on housing.
*28:18.160- 28:20.460* :  That will be sure to play into many voting decisions
*28:20.460- 28:23.180* :  on the day of the UK's election to lie the fourth.
*28:23.700- 28:24.640* :  The Annaburn reporting.
*28:25.200- 28:28.780* :  People hoping to climb Japan's famous volcano Mount Fuji
*28:28.780- 28:33.220* :  using its most popular route must now pay a $13 charge.
*28:33.920- 28:35.460* :  The authorities are trying to limit the numbers
*28:35.460- 28:37.220* :  scaling Japan's highest peak.
*28:37.760- 28:40.440* :  More for my Asia Pacific Regional Editor Celia Hatton.
*28:40.820- 28:44.740* :  Last year more than 220,000 people scaled Mount Fuji
*28:44.740- 28:46.300* :  between July and September.
*28:46.840- 28:49.660* :  Officials are hoping to drastically reduce that number.
*28:50.180- 28:54.280* :  They're frustrated by congested paths littered with piles of rubbish.
*28:54.920- 28:58.620* :  A rising number of hikers have also needed emergency medical treatment
*28:58.620- 29:01.920* :  either because of altitude sickness, hypothermia
*29:02.460- 29:07.640* :  or simply because they're poorly equipped to scale Mount Fuji's 12,000-foot summit.
*29:08.340- 29:12.120* :  Some have attempted to withstand the summit's sub-zero temperatures
*29:12.120- 29:14.640* :  in shorts and flimsy sandals.
*29:15.160- 29:18.880* :  Starting today, only 4,000 people a day will be permitted
*29:18.880- 29:22.900* :  onto the Yoshida Trail Mount Fuji's most popular path
*29:23.480- 29:26.380* :  and a gate halfway up will close after 4pm.
*29:27.080- 29:30.460* :  It's aimed at turning away those who try to hike overnight
*29:30.460- 29:32.360* :  to reach the peak at sunrise,
*29:32.420- 29:37.140* :  the same group that often require the most emergency medical attention.
*29:37.940- 29:40.360* :  Our Asia Pacific Regional Editor Celia Hatton.
*29:41.220- 29:44.880* :  A corner of Southwest London is the focus of tennis fans today
*29:44.880- 29:47.300* :  as the Wimbledon Championships gets underway.
*29:47.300- 29:51.660* :  There's been plenty of talk of a changing of the guard in men's tennis recently
*29:51.660- 29:55.820* :  and this year could mark the final appearances of the likes of former champions
*29:55.820- 29:57.900* :  Novak Jokovic and Andy Murray.
*29:57.900- 30:02.700* :  Jokovic has just had knee surgery but is well known for battling through physical setbacks.
*30:03.320- 30:06.100* :  What doesn't change from year to year is the famous Q.
*30:06.100- 30:09.300* :  Many people camped out overnight to secure tickets.
*30:09.860- 30:12.000* :  Our reporter Oli Samuels spoke to some of them.
*30:12.460- 30:14.280* :  We got here Friday afternoon.
*30:15.240- 30:17.860* :  And what number dare I ask are you in the queue?
*30:18.080- 30:19.340* :  We are four and five.
*30:20.020- 30:22.460* :  That's incredible and where would you come from to be here?
*30:22.460- 30:23.080* :  We come to Houston, Texas.
*30:23.840- 30:26.400* :  And what is it about Wimbledon that is so special?
*30:27.500- 30:30.220* :  It's the mecca of tennis. It's the most beautiful tournament.
*30:30.240- 30:32.520* :  It's the origin of it all.
*30:32.520- 30:36.820* :  It's, you know, the beauty, the great tennis, the great people,
*30:36.820- 30:38.880* :  the camaraderie that's out here on the queue.
*30:39.480- 30:42.040* :  Everything is just the atmosphere is phenomenal.
*30:42.440- 30:46.240* :  Well, our reporter in Wimbledon itself is Shabnam Unis Jewel.
*30:46.380- 30:48.680* :  So given that talk of a change in the guard,
*30:49.200- 30:50.640* :  do things feel different this year?
*30:51.060- 30:52.160* :  I'm not sent to court right now.
*30:52.160- 30:55.560* :  And yeah, it does, particularly in the men's game,
*30:55.560- 30:58.380* :  as you, as you mentioned, because, you know,
*30:58.380- 31:00.320* :  those big names aren't really there anymore.
*31:00.320- 31:02.760* :  There are doubts over the two that are remaining.
*31:02.760- 31:04.400* :  Novak Jokovic and Andy Murray.
*31:04.400- 31:06.420* :  Well, the weather, they're even going to play.
*31:06.420- 31:07.840* :  And whether it's the last one,
*31:08.300- 31:11.360* :  we've got all eyes today on Carlos Alcaraff.
*31:11.360- 31:13.200* :  He is the big new thing, isn't he?
*31:13.200- 31:16.320* :  The Spaniard only 21 years old.
*31:16.680- 31:20.460* :  And as one three majors already, he's come in as defending champion,
*31:20.460- 31:22.560* :  a really special year for him this.
*31:22.960- 31:26.140* :  And just off the back of winning the French Open as well.
*31:26.140- 31:28.640* :  So looking for back-to-back wins here,
*31:28.640- 31:31.340* :  I think his name is on many people's lips.
*31:31.340- 31:35.020* :  And as well as Janik Sinner, the new world number one.
*31:35.700- 31:37.280* :  He's on a court number one today.
*31:37.720- 31:41.000* :  And another name that I think many people are looking forward
*31:41.000- 31:41.780* :  to watching.
*31:42.280- 31:46.340* :  And those two, I think, are developing into rivals,
*31:46.340- 31:48.700* :  into two very exciting players.
*31:49.180- 31:52.020* :  And they're the ones that are taking over now, I think,
*31:52.020- 31:54.680* :  which happens, you know, in every generation of every sport,
*31:54.680- 31:56.820* :  new players come in and they take over
*31:56.820- 32:00.300* :  and they become those icons of the sport.
*32:00.300- 32:02.620* :  So, yeah, definitely in the men's game, that's happening.
*32:03.440- 32:06.560* :  So the big stories today with Murray and Jokovic.
*32:06.560- 32:08.980* :  Well, Jokovic has said, even though he had that knee surgery,
*32:08.980- 32:10.020* :  that he is going to be playing.
*32:10.020- 32:13.020* :  And he wants to be considered one of the favourites still.
*32:13.420- 32:16.000* :  You can never knock that determination and fighting spirit that he has.
*32:16.000- 32:17.560* :  It's almost a stubbornness, isn't it?
*32:17.860- 32:20.440* :  And if he won a record equaling eighth title this year,
*32:20.440- 32:22.240* :  that would be his biggest achievement yet.
*32:22.640- 32:24.480* :  On Andy Murray, well, we've got a way to find out
*32:24.480- 32:25.820* :  whether he's going to play in the singles.
*32:26.240- 32:27.340* :  He's fighting to be fit.
*32:27.340- 32:29.460* :  He had back surgery recently,
*32:29.460- 32:31.340* :  which has spoiled his plan to win more than a little bit.
*32:31.740- 32:33.300* :  And he said he's going to decide later today,
*32:33.300- 32:35.680* :  whether he'll play his singles match tomorrow.
*32:36.440- 32:38.120* :  He might just play in the doubles.
*32:38.120- 32:39.940* :  He'll give him a bit more time to recover.
*32:40.600- 32:41.900* :  He might play with his with his brother.
*32:42.460- 32:44.000* :  And yeah, this could be his farewell.
*32:44.000- 32:46.420* :  Well, it most likely is his farewell Wimbledon.
*32:46.420- 32:49.080* :  And he wants that opportunity to play it one more time out there.
*32:49.460- 32:51.460* :  So yeah, this could possibly could be a last chance
*32:51.460- 32:53.480* :  to see those two big names this year.
*32:53.820- 32:58.240* :  In the women's game, we got used to the dominance of the Williams sisters
*32:58.580- 32:59.920* :  for many years in Wimbledon.
*33:00.620- 33:01.760* :  Who should we look out for this year?
*33:02.440- 33:05.120* :  Yeah, it's definitely a lot more open in the women's game,
*33:05.140- 33:08.440* :  where we've had brand new winners for the last six years
*33:08.440- 33:11.840* :  since the dominance of the Williams sisters.
*33:11.840- 33:13.460* :  So you've got a few players you can look at.
*33:13.460- 33:16.840* :  We had the first unseeded player to win last year,
*33:16.840- 33:19.960* :  Marquette of Andrusheva of the Czech Republic coming in again.
*33:20.460- 33:21.840* :  We've got Coco Golf.
*33:22.680- 33:24.560* :  She is, of course, a prodigy here,
*33:24.560- 33:28.420* :  since she beat Venus Williams at the age of 15 five years ago.
*33:28.420- 33:30.200* :  She'll be one of the favourites this year.
*33:30.600- 33:32.980* :  On Jabir, we call her the Minister of Happiness.
*33:33.400- 33:34.460* :  We've had tears from her.
*33:34.800- 33:37.160* :  She could be another favourite here this year as well.
*33:37.160- 33:39.540* :  And then, of course, we've got the world number one, eager swan tech.
*33:40.080- 33:42.720* :  Not done to get on grass before, but let's see how she does.
*33:43.040- 33:46.740* :  Now, let's end on a story that brought a smile to some people this weekend
*33:46.740- 33:49.680* :  with the European football championships in full swing.
*33:49.680- 33:53.560* :  Some music fans at the UK's largest festival, Glastonbury,
*33:54.080- 33:57.540* :  didn't want to miss out on watching the game between England and Slovakia.
*33:57.980- 34:00.260* :  And a surprise helper came to their rescue.
*34:00.800- 34:05.260* :  None other than Louis Tomlinson, one of the stars of the pop band One Direction.
*34:05.560- 34:08.760* :  He managed to get a flat screen that he bought the same day,
*34:08.760- 34:12.380* :  took it to the festival area and made sure that at least one group of people
*34:12.380- 34:15.560* :  could enjoy it, if that's the right word, watching England.
*34:15.560- 34:19.340* :  Our culture and media editor Katie Razzle caught up with a pop star
*34:19.740- 34:20.940* :  by the makeshift setup.
*34:21.480- 34:25.980* :  You are the god of this festival because football wasn't officially on anywhere,
*34:25.980- 34:27.880* :  but you sorted it out. How did you do that?
*34:28.180- 34:31.140* :  It was a little bit, well, we brought a TV in, very Glaston,
*34:31.140- 34:35.880* :  in some like stones, in a little stand, it was a little bit touch and go at times
*34:35.880- 34:37.820* :  because the signal kept going in and out, but yeah,
*34:38.100- 34:40.700* :  luckily we got the win, we pulled it off, made up, made up.
*34:40.700- 34:40.900* :  Well done!
*34:41.620- 34:44.160* :  Yeah, a little bit touch and go, rather like England's performance,
*34:44.160- 34:49.540* :  but fortunately, the country was rescued by that acrobatic goal from Jude Bellingham.
*34:52.380- 34:56.380* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*34:56.380- 35:00.240* :  This edition was mixed by Tom Bartlett and produced by Stephanie Zacherson.
*35:00.520- 35:02.760* :  Our editors Karen Martin, I'm Oliver Conway.
*35:02.880- 35:04.060* :  Until next time, goodbye.
*35:11.760- 35:16.540* :  This is the story of how a group of people brought music back to Afghanistan
*35:16.620- 35:21.060* :  by creating their own version of American Idol.
*35:22.260- 35:23.860* :  The joy they brought to the nation.
*35:24.360- 35:27.600* :  You're free completely, no one is there to destroy you.
*35:27.900- 35:29.560* :  The danger they endured.
*35:29.980- 35:32.180* :  This fact, my head should be cut off.
*35:33.000- 35:33.820* :  I'm John Legend.
*35:34.440- 35:39.640* :  Listen to Afghan Star on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcast.
