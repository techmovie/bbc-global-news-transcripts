*00:00.000- 00:03.460* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:04.640- 00:09.160* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in the early hours of Friday 5th of July, these are our main stories.
*00:09.180- 00:15.000* :  Exit polls following Britain's general election suggest a landslide victory for the opposition
*00:15.000- 00:19.540* :  Labour Party, meaning its leader, Keir Starmer, will become the Prime Minister.
*00:20.080- 00:24.300* :  It's projected to be the worst-ever result for the Conservative Party, which has been
*00:24.300- 00:26.240* :  in power for the last 14 years.
*00:26.860- 00:31.720* :  In other news, President Biden has welcomed an announcement by Israel's Prime Minister
*00:31.720- 00:37.460* :  that he'll send a negotiating team to resume talks in Qatar, aimed at securing the release
*00:37.460- 00:44.640* :  of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and the security forces in Ecuador have rescued 49 people
*00:45.000- 00:46.960* :  who have been abducted by a criminal gang.
*00:49.760- 00:51.100* :  Also in this podcast?
*00:58.580- 01:00.680* :  You can no longer cuddle a koala in Brisbane.
*01:05.660- 01:08.420* :  We begin with the general election in the United Kingdom.
*01:11.580- 01:17.560* :  And as Big Ben strikes 10, the exit poll is predicting a Labour landslide.
*01:18.260- 01:23.360* :  Sir Keir Starmer will become Prime Minister with a majority of around 170 seats.
*01:23.800- 01:29.820* :  The exit poll predicts that Labour will have captured 410 seats, adding 209.
*01:29.820- 01:36.920* :  It suggests the Conservatives will have lost 241 MPs landing on 131.
*01:36.920- 01:43.100* :  The main BBC television news in London announced the exit poll as voting closed.
*01:43.740- 01:48.500* :  So if this poll is born out, it will be a stunning turnaround in British politics,
*01:48.500- 01:54.080* :  and after 14 years in government, the Conservatives are on course for their worst-ever result.
*01:54.800- 02:00.800* :  To put it in context, at the last election in 2019, Boris Johnson was elected Prime Minister
*02:00.800- 02:03.400* :  with an 80-seat Conservative majority.
*02:03.400- 02:10.060* :  While the Labour Party suffered its worst results since 1935, my colleague Oliver Conway
*02:10.060- 02:12.460* :  spoke to our political correspondent Rob Watson.
*02:13.160- 02:15.660* :  So Keir Starmer is going to be Britain's Prime Minister.
*02:16.440- 02:18.780* :  Absolutely. It is a Labour landslide.
*02:18.780- 02:23.340* :  I mean, as you say, it just seems to be a little bit behind what Labour achieved in 1997,
*02:23.340- 02:27.820* :  but I mean, this is nothing short of an electoral earthquake.
*02:27.820- 02:30.980* :  And I say electoral rather than political for the following reason,
*02:30.980- 02:34.040* :  that a parliament is going to look completely different.
*02:34.040- 02:39.740* :  The Conservative Party have been pretty much decimated their worst results since 1906.
*02:39.740- 02:41.880* :  We'll have this huge Labour presence.
*02:41.880- 02:45.060* :  But the reason why I'm hesitating to say political earthquake
*02:45.720- 02:51.360* :  is that the result of astonishing it as it is doesn't seem to be based on a political fault line.
*02:51.360- 02:53.840* :  I mean, it's not as if there were any great policy differences
*02:54.400- 02:58.220* :  added in this election campaign between Conservatives and Labour,
*02:58.220- 03:01.580* :  whether that's domestic, macroeconomic policy,
*03:02.120- 03:03.640* :  indeed, whether it is foreign policy.
*03:03.640- 03:08.880* :  I mean, this result seems to be pretty much entirely driven by an intense dislike
*03:09.460- 03:11.140* :  of the governing Conservative Party.
*03:11.140- 03:15.760* :  And because the vote on the right in Britain has been split by the arrival of that man,
*03:15.760- 03:20.580* :  Nigel Farage and the populist right of centre party that he leads reform.
*03:20.580- 03:22.560* :  But I mean, whatever way you look at it,
*03:22.740- 03:25.260* :  it is undoubtedly an electoral earthquake,
*03:25.380- 03:28.220* :  whether there's going to be a political earthquake that follows it.
*03:28.220- 03:30.940* :  We're going to see in the coming days, weeks and years.
*03:31.220- 03:33.120* :  And how reliable is this exit poll?
*03:33.720- 03:36.680* :  It's always been pretty reliable in the past.
*03:36.740- 03:40.020* :  I mean, they only tend to get a few seats wrong here or there.
*03:40.500- 03:44.720* :  I mean, they are saying we were told we were briefed by those behind the exit poll
*03:44.720- 03:46.300* :  that there are some difficulties.
*03:46.300- 03:49.400* :  So we, so for example, things could be rather close between
*03:49.400- 03:53.800* :  Labour and the Scottish National Party, the pro-independence party in Scotland
*03:53.800- 03:59.400* :  and the pollsters aren't entirely sure about exactly how well reform is going to do.
*03:59.400- 04:02.220* :  And that's because they're doing rather well in lots of seats,
*04:02.220- 04:04.540* :  but they're not quite sure how well.
*04:04.740- 04:07.500* :  But I mean, we get the general picture and, you know,
*04:07.500- 04:09.660* :  one shouldn't forget what the big story is tonight.
*04:09.760- 04:11.580* :  I mean, there's just no doubt about that.
*04:11.880- 04:13.760* :  You don't need to be the smartest political journalist.
*04:13.760- 04:17.020* :  It is Labour landslide conservative wipeout.
*04:17.300- 04:19.000* :  And what do you put that down to?
*04:20.000- 04:21.440* :  I put it down to a number of things.
*04:21.440- 04:26.380* :  So the first thing is that it is the most powerful force in politics.
*04:26.380- 04:28.520* :  That is gravity, political gravity.
*04:28.520- 04:31.460* :  So the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years.
*04:31.960- 04:34.360* :  And no party in Britain had ever won five terms.
*04:34.360- 04:37.380* :  So if the Conservatives had one, that would have been utterly amazing.
*04:37.780- 04:41.060* :  But then you have to get into the weeds of what happened during those 14 years.
*04:41.700- 04:45.800* :  And essentially, during those 14 years, living standards have stagnated.
*04:46.200- 04:48.320* :  It's one of the worst periods for living standards.
*04:48.880- 04:50.840* :  If you go back as early as the 19th century,
*04:50.840- 04:54.680* :  haven't seen sort of 15, 20 years where living standards have stagnated like this
*04:54.940- 04:57.340* :  since the Napoleonic Wars for goodness sake, Oliver.
*04:58.080- 04:58.800* :  So there's that.
*04:58.800- 05:01.000* :  And there's also the kind of chaos of it all.
*05:01.380- 05:04.420* :  I mean, during the last 14 years, regular listeners will know
*05:04.720- 05:07.260* :  we've had the Brexit referendum, we've had Boris Johnson,
*05:07.300- 05:09.940* :  we've had five Conservative Prime Ministers.
*05:09.940- 05:13.700* :  I mean, I can't recall any period in British politics
*05:13.700- 05:17.980* :  since 1945 that has been anything like as turbulent as this.
*05:17.980- 05:20.420* :  And actually, you know, the big question this raises,
*05:21.060- 05:22.460* :  this result, because if you think about it,
*05:22.460- 05:25.300* :  it's just as you were saying earlier, the volatility of it.
*05:25.580- 05:29.340* :  And we've gone from in 2019, we were sitting here five years ago,
*05:29.340- 05:30.780* :  right? You were here. We were all here.
*05:31.160- 05:34.700* :  And we were looking at, wow, there's this amazing majority for Boris Johnson,
*05:35.100- 05:37.420* :  80 seat majority, get Brexit done.
*05:37.420- 05:41.940* :  People were saying he surveys the British political landscape like a colossus.
*05:42.260- 05:44.840* :  And now here we are with the Labour landslide,
*05:45.260- 05:47.680* :  which makes you think, you know, there's something going on in Britain.
*05:47.680- 05:50.760* :  There's something, there's something incredibly volatile about the electorate.
*05:51.220- 05:54.100* :  So you have to ask, well, is this, is this, ah, you know,
*05:54.540- 05:57.140* :  we calm down, we go back to politics as usual?
*05:57.500- 05:58.860* :  Or is there going to be more of the same?
*05:59.360- 06:00.380* :  Yeah, more of the same.
*06:00.380- 06:03.540* :  What are the challenges facing, Sir Kirstama,
*06:03.880- 06:05.700* :  if indeed he does become Prime Minister, come the morning?
*06:06.040- 06:08.860* :  Well, I mean, I guess if you were to articulate the challenge
*06:08.880- 06:11.980* :  in a way that sort of people without getting into sort of the policy weeds,
*06:12.580- 06:15.640* :  you know, one of the reasons why this, this result has happened,
*06:16.060- 06:19.380* :  is that a lot of people in Britain just feel like the place just isn't working properly,
*06:19.380- 06:22.620* :  whether it's the, you know, the hospitals, the roads, the transport,
*06:23.060- 06:26.600* :  the trains, you don't have to go very far to hear British people say,
*06:26.600- 06:27.940* :  oh, nothing works anymore.
*06:28.280- 06:29.260* :  Everything is rubbish.
*06:29.760- 06:34.320* :  So now, you know, whatever the expectations of the British people are,
*06:34.320- 06:36.320* :  and we know that they're apathetic about politicians,
*06:36.320- 06:40.340* :  but I mean, it does rather fall on the Labour government to now say,
*06:40.340- 06:42.360* :  well, yeah, we heard that you think nothing works.
*06:42.840- 06:44.680* :  I mean, I think there will be a certain expectation
*06:44.720- 06:46.740* :  that Labour are going to have to make it work.
*06:46.800- 06:49.360* :  And it's not going to be easy because, you know,
*06:49.360- 06:52.240* :  they have inherited a situation where the British economy
*06:52.240- 06:56.080* :  has been growing incredibly slowly for a decade or so.
*06:56.080- 06:58.380* :  Pretty much like most other Western European countries.
*06:58.960- 07:00.900* :  The problem that raises, then, is, you know,
*07:00.900- 07:02.760* :  when people say, oh, nothing works anymore,
*07:02.760- 07:04.560* :  that tends to mean, you know, the government,
*07:04.560- 07:07.640* :  having to spend more money on trains, hospitals, education,
*07:07.640- 07:08.600* :  and everything else.
*07:09.180- 07:11.860* :  But the government isn't getting the kind of revenues to spend.
*07:11.980- 07:13.340* :  So that's the dilemma that faces.
*07:13.340- 07:14.580* :  You've got this expectation.
*07:14.640- 07:16.440* :  We want things to start working again.
*07:16.680- 07:18.640* :  Where, how do you get things working again, normally,
*07:19.020- 07:21.160* :  you know, with patients, economic growth,
*07:21.540- 07:24.540* :  and spending more money, quite often is the case.
*07:24.680- 07:26.920* :  And all of those things look incredibly difficult.
*07:27.480- 07:28.340* :  That was Rob Watson.
*07:29.060- 07:30.400* :  As part of our election coverage,
*07:30.400- 07:33.220* :  Valerie Sanderson traveled to the Scottish City of Glasgow,
*07:33.220- 07:36.500* :  where the exit polls suggest a dramatic result.
*07:37.200- 07:40.360* :  Well, I can tell you that the exit polls are suggesting
*07:40.800- 07:44.580* :  that the Scottish National Party is down to just 10 seats.
*07:45.020- 07:46.520* :  That's from 48.
*07:47.200- 07:49.780* :  But we think we're in for an interesting night,
*07:49.780- 07:52.340* :  because we're hearing that quite a few seats
*07:52.920- 07:54.320* :  are still too close to call.
*07:54.320- 07:56.460* :  So let me give you the big picture.
*07:56.880- 08:00.320* :  After boundary changes, there are 57 constituencies
*08:00.320- 08:02.240* :  here in Scotland up for grabs.
*08:02.260- 08:06.820* :  Now that's down from 59 at the last general election in 2019.
*08:07.600- 08:10.760* :  Now, Scotland is different from the rest of the UK.
*08:11.100- 08:13.580* :  Not one seat here is a battle
*08:13.640- 08:15.580* :  between the Conservative and Labour parties.
*08:16.040- 08:18.740* :  Instead of the domination of those parties here,
*08:19.160- 08:21.860* :  there is the SNP, and the clue is in the name.
*08:21.960- 08:24.920* :  The SNP, of course, is the Scottish National Party,
*08:24.920- 08:28.880* :  which wants independence for Scotland from the rest of the UK.
*08:29.440- 08:33.240* :  And the SNP has been in power here for the last 17 years.
*08:33.820- 08:36.040* :  Well, in the last general election in 2019,
*08:36.040- 08:40.400* :  the SNP won 48 seats, the Conservative six,
*08:40.400- 08:41.940* :  the Liberal Democrats two,
*08:42.420- 08:45.740* :  and the Labour party, which had been dominant before that,
*08:46.160- 08:47.900* :  won just one seat.
*08:48.380- 08:51.460* :  So let me explain. There are three main battlegrounds.
*08:51.500- 08:53.520* :  There's the SNP versus Labour,
*08:54.140- 08:56.040* :  particularly across the central belt.
*08:56.400- 08:59.080* :  Well, I'm in Glasgow, beside the river Clyde,
*08:59.080- 09:02.500* :  and the central belt, it stretches across from Glasgow,
*09:02.500- 09:05.180* :  here in the West, to Edinburgh in the East,
*09:05.520- 09:07.980* :  three and a half million people live here.
*09:08.420- 09:10.360* :  That's most of the population of Scotland.
*09:10.380- 09:14.260* :  There are mainly urban voters, many of them working class,
*09:14.260- 09:18.620* :  and Glasgow itself with six seats is a big prize.
*09:19.340- 09:21.380* :  All are currently SNP seats,
*09:21.380- 09:24.380* :  with Labour trying to dislodge the incumbents.
*09:24.740- 09:26.280* :  Now elsewhere in the country,
*09:26.280- 09:30.300* :  the Conservatives are trying to hold on to the constituencies they have
*09:30.660- 09:31.800* :  in the North East,
*09:32.360- 09:36.080* :  and also south from me, where I am in Glasgow,
*09:36.600- 09:38.200* :  along the border with England.
*09:38.200- 09:43.040* :  There is also a tussle between the SNP and the Liberal Democrats.
*09:43.040- 09:45.820* :  That's concentrated on half a dozen seats,
*09:46.260- 09:47.920* :  including Orkley and Shetlands,
*09:47.920- 09:50.620* :  way off the North East coast of Scotland,
*09:50.660- 09:54.560* :  and of course in the Highlands to the North of me,
*09:54.720- 09:56.740* :  they are more rural constituencies,
*09:57.140- 10:00.600* :  where farming and tourism are strong industries.
*10:00.600- 10:01.380* :  That's the picture.
*10:01.880- 10:03.020* :  And what are the big issues, Ben?
*10:03.700- 10:07.680* :  Well, Jackie, the issue of independence isn't going away.
*10:07.680- 10:10.700* :  The referendum, you may remember back in 2014.
*10:10.820- 10:14.860* :  That was where the no voters who wanted to stay within the UK,
*10:15.420- 10:17.900* :  they made up 55% of the vote,
*10:18.240- 10:20.800* :  to the 45% who wanted to leave.
*10:21.340- 10:24.820* :  But since then, the polls have shown the country is pretty well split
*10:24.820- 10:29.680* :  down the middle about 50-50 on the idea of going it alone.
*10:29.680- 10:31.780* :  But in this election,
*10:32.380- 10:34.400* :  independence has not been the top priority.
*10:35.120- 10:38.340* :  Scottish voters, and I've been talking to a lot of them today out in Glasgow,
*10:38.340- 10:42.320* :  I think they've been reflecting the views of the rest of the UK.
*10:42.720- 10:45.120* :  People have been worried about the cost of living.
*10:45.120- 10:46.940* :  You know, the price of food and energy.
*10:47.180- 10:48.580* :  They've been saying to me, you know,
*10:48.580- 10:50.160* :  they just don't have enough money.
*10:50.160- 10:53.380* :  They're also worried about the national health service,
*10:53.880- 10:55.320* :  housing and transport.
*10:55.720- 10:58.100* :  But here again, Scotland is different,
*10:58.100- 11:00.580* :  because it has a devolved government.
*11:01.060- 11:02.640* :  That's at Holyridden Edinburgh,
*11:02.640- 11:06.520* :  which has quite a lot of power over these day-to-day issues.
*11:06.520- 11:09.300* :  But of course, Westminster, the bottom line is,
*11:09.620- 11:12.780* :  Westminster has the money, and it distributes it,
*11:13.160- 11:16.260* :  even if whoever is in power here, currently the SNP,
*11:16.260- 11:19.800* :  has a lot of leeway about what exactly to do with it.
*11:19.800- 11:22.380* :  And of course, Westminster is also in charge
*11:22.380- 11:26.300* :  overall of defence, immigration, welfare and foreign affairs.
*11:27.100- 11:30.760* :  But I would say the selection is about who runs Scotland from within.
*11:30.760- 11:36.160* :  The SNP, as I said, has been in charge for 17 years since 2007.
*11:36.720- 11:39.880* :  And it's also about Scotland's relationship with the rest of the UK,
*11:39.880- 11:42.180* :  where, of course, there's been a Conservative government
*11:42.180- 11:43.460* :  for the past 14 years,
*11:43.880- 11:47.760* :  and which many people feel does not serve Scottish interests.
*11:48.400- 11:50.360* :  That was Valerie Sanderson in Scotland.
*11:50.940- 11:54.800* :  Well, Professor Sir John Curtis is the BBC's polling expert
*11:54.800- 11:58.700* :  and Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde.
*11:58.980- 12:00.600* :  So what are his thoughts on the exit poll?
*12:01.040- 12:03.380* :  The crucial thing, first of all, you need to realise
*12:03.420- 12:08.260* :  is that this seat forecast is not just simply a consequence
*12:08.340- 12:12.340* :  of the national shares of the vote that we expect the parties to gain,
*12:13.020- 12:16.260* :  but rather how they are distributed geographically
*12:16.900- 12:21.160* :  and how that has moved decisively against the Conservatives.
*12:21.820- 12:25.580* :  So for example, support for the Conservatives
*12:25.580- 12:30.860* :  is falling much more heavily in places where they are trying to defend a seat
*12:31.400- 12:33.800* :  than it is in places that Labour already hold.
*12:34.340- 12:35.420* :  But why is that happening?
*12:35.900- 12:40.060* :  It's not because Labour are doing spectacularly better in Conservative held seats.
*12:40.660- 12:42.560* :  It's because reform are.
*12:43.100- 12:46.880* :  Much of the damage to the Conservative party tonight is being done by reform,
*12:47.640- 12:51.160* :  even if it is the Labour party that proves to be the beneficiary.
*12:52.160- 12:56.460* :  That point, too, then, however, the second thing that's making life difficult for the Conservatives
*12:56.900- 12:58.540* :  is where our Labour are doing best,
*12:58.540- 13:03.900* :  while they're doing better in places where they're starting off second to the Conservatives.
*13:03.900- 13:07.540* :  And by the way, also places, they also seem to be doing quite well
*13:07.540- 13:09.880* :  in the battle with the S&P, which I'll come back to that.
*13:10.280- 13:12.960* :  But equally, why is the Liberal Democrat figure so high?
*13:13.400- 13:17.220* :  It's not because we're anticipating some spectacular rise in Liberal Democrats' support,
*13:17.740- 13:22.120* :  but rather that Ed Davies hopes of doing particularly well in seats
*13:22.120- 13:25.320* :  where the Liberal Democrats are the challenges to the Conservatives.
*13:25.400- 13:27.300* :  It looks as though that hope is going to be realised.
*13:28.000- 13:29.800* :  So there are two things that flow from that.
*13:30.480- 13:32.320* :  First, an obvious health warning.
*13:32.700- 13:36.980* :  Well, we are pretty convinced that this pattern will exist by the end of the night.
*13:37.660- 13:40.660* :  Whether we've got it exactly right is much more uncertain.
*13:40.780- 13:43.940* :  Whether we've slightly overestimated or underestimated these patterns
*13:44.400- 13:47.540* :  could make quite a lot of difference to the seat outcome.
*13:48.080- 13:52.100* :  The second thing that flows from this is that although this looks like an election
*13:52.480- 13:55.100* :  in which Labour are going to get a landslide in terms of seats,
*13:55.800- 13:56.860* :  it does not follow.
*13:56.860- 14:01.940* :  I will repeat, it does not follow that this necessarily means that Labour have got a landslide
*14:02.520- 14:03.400* :  in terms of votes.
*14:03.700- 14:08.140* :  So that's point number one about the broad picture we're presenting this exit poll.
*14:08.660- 14:10.980* :  The health warning that goes with the estimate,
*14:11.460- 14:15.500* :  but also the implications for how we might end up interpreting this result
*14:15.900- 14:16.700* :  at the end of the night.
*14:17.120- 14:18.760* :  There are then two other things to say.
*14:19.180- 14:22.580* :  The two figures that I think has probably caused most surprise,
*14:22.700- 14:25.220* :  most discussion, perhaps most controversial,
*14:26.000- 14:31.100* :  are one reform at 13 and two, the SMP at 10.
*14:31.740- 14:35.580* :  Those are the two figures about which we are least certain.
*14:36.040- 14:39.200* :  Basically what we have got in the exit poll is a lot of places
*14:39.920- 14:44.180* :  where there is a small chance that reform will win the seat,
*14:44.180- 14:47.140* :  but we're talking about 20, 30% chance.
*14:47.720- 14:51.940* :  And we add up these probabilities and that's how we get to the figure of 13.
*14:52.600- 14:56.200* :  But to be honest, the figure could end up being quite a lot less than that
*14:56.600- 15:00.120* :  or indeed, well, the more, just depending on how the cookie crumbles.
*15:00.660- 15:03.920* :  I mean, more equally, it's already been emphasising for the beginning of the night.
*15:04.400- 15:08.040* :  Inevitably, we have fewer sampling points in Scotland than elsewhere.
*15:08.820- 15:11.740* :  It does look as though the SMP have done particularly badly.
*15:12.240- 15:14.760* :  But remember, there are lots of seats in Scotland,
*15:14.760- 15:17.020* :  which are marginal between Labour and the SMP.
*15:17.580- 15:21.440* :  And we have just, if we even, if we've just underestimated the SMP's performance,
*15:22.040- 15:23.700* :  relative to Labour by a little bit,
*15:24.160- 15:26.480* :  then that SMP number will go up.
*15:26.860- 15:28.060* :  So those are the health warnings.
*15:28.700- 15:32.040* :  Of course, behind all of this, it does look as though, yep,
*15:32.060- 15:35.480* :  Sir Kirstover is going to be the Prime Minister tomorrow.
*15:36.000- 15:38.760* :  He's probably going to have a very substantial overall majority.
*15:38.760- 15:41.000* :  And that, of course, is the crucial thing we're trying to find out.
*15:41.460- 15:45.580* :  But there is still inevitably plenty of uncertainty in unelection,
*15:45.580- 15:49.720* :  which in many ways looks as though we're going to come up with all sorts
*15:49.720- 15:53.160* :  of historical records in terms of shares, seats,
*15:53.160- 15:55.540* :  and also the change in the geography of support.
*15:55.540- 15:59.100* :  This is an essay that's going to be one of the most interesting and unprecedented elections
*15:59.620- 16:00.900* :  in British psychological history.
*16:01.660- 16:04.940* :  That was the BBC's polling expert, Professor Sir John Curtis.
*16:06.140- 16:11.080* :  In other news, the French Interior Ministry says it will deploy 30,000 police officers
*16:11.080- 16:12.860* :  on the streets on Sunday evening,
*16:13.360- 16:17.140* :  because of fears that the result of the second round of a parliamentary election there
*16:17.560- 16:18.560* :  could lead to violence.
*16:19.160- 16:22.680* :  Three candidates have reported being attacked while out campaigning.
*16:23.040- 16:26.680* :  The Prime Minister Gabriel Atal said that violence and intimidation
*16:26.960- 16:28.800* :  have no place in French democracy.
*16:29.540- 16:31.900* :  Our correspondent, Huesco Field, reports from Paris.
*16:32.400- 16:35.080* :  Prisca Teveno, whose spokeswoman for the Atal government,
*16:35.080- 16:38.760* :  was putting up posters with two colleagues in the Paris suburb of Mordor,
*16:39.080- 16:39.860* :  where she's a candidate.
*16:39.860- 16:43.820* :  When a young local started to deface one of the posters, they protested
*16:43.820- 16:47.800* :  at which point a gang of his friends arrived and violently assaulted them.
*16:47.800- 16:50.700* :  Miss Teveno was unheard, but the other two were hospitalised,
*16:50.980- 16:52.080* :  one with a broken jaw.
*16:52.080- 16:56.320* :  The Prime Minister Gabriel Atal was in Mordor, the lend support to his government colleagues.
*16:56.460- 16:57.680* :  We can be in agreement.
*16:58.140- 17:00.600* :  Of course, there are opposing views in the democracy,
*17:00.920- 17:04.140* :  but it is unacceptable to use verbal or physical attacks
*17:04.140- 17:06.860* :  as, unfortunately, has been the case in this campaign.
*17:07.520- 17:11.340* :  You will always find me on the side of those who seek to conciliate and to unite,
*17:11.340- 17:13.560* :  rather than to divide and fuel hatred.
*17:13.740- 17:15.180* :  Yeah, alimentate the end.
*17:15.340- 17:18.540* :  Two other incidents have been reported in the Eastern Savloir region.
*17:18.880- 17:22.860* :  A candidate for the National Rally was assaulted while canvassing in a market,
*17:23.180- 17:27.480* :  and in Grenoble, a 67-year-old handing out leaflets for a pro-macron candidate
*17:27.820- 17:30.400* :  was punched in the face by somebody from the far left.
*17:30.400- 17:34.440* :  It's a tense campaign, and the authorities are worried about it getting tensor.
*17:34.440- 17:37.540* :  Police will be on standby in Paris and many other cities
*17:37.540- 17:39.660* :  when the results come in on Sunday evening.
*17:40.360- 17:41.580* :  You scoffield in France.
*17:42.440- 17:45.920* :  In what could be a significant step towards a ceasefire in Gaza,
*17:45.920- 17:49.680* :  Israel has announced it will now resume talks with Hamas in Qatar.
*17:49.700- 17:52.840* :  The news was welcomed by the US President Joe Biden,
*17:52.840- 17:57.500* :  who has spoken directly by telephone to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*17:57.980- 18:00.720* :  Here's our US State Department correspondent Tom Bateman.
*18:01.320- 18:05.620* :  A phone call between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu is significant.
*18:05.620- 18:10.240* :  It shows that there is progress in this they talk relatively infrequently.
*18:10.900- 18:13.920* :  I think the critical moment was yesterday where we got a statement from Hamas
*18:13.920- 18:19.920* :  saying that they had responded, in their words, positively to the American-backed proposal,
*18:19.920- 18:24.960* :  reiterating that they want to see a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Raffa,
*18:25.000- 18:27.740* :  in the South from the so-called Philadelphia Corridor, this area,
*18:27.740- 18:30.380* :  on the border between Gaza and Egypt.
*18:31.220- 18:33.620* :  And then we had today an announcement from the Israelis
*18:34.200- 18:37.180* :  about sending David Barnet, the Director of Mossad,
*18:37.180- 18:39.320* :  and other officials back to Doha.
*18:40.120- 18:44.380* :  Now the phone call between Mr. Biden and Mr. Netanyahu, around 30 minutes,
*18:44.880- 18:48.060* :  now my sense is, from a senior administration official,
*18:48.060- 18:52.140* :  that this was very much about the nuts and bolts of implementation of this deal.
*18:52.360- 18:56.960* :  The sticking point has always been that the American-backed proposal had been in phases.
*18:56.960- 19:04.800* :  The first phase, a temporary ceasefire, in return for the release of the elderly and wounded hostages,
*19:05.200- 19:08.260* :  had also the release of Palestinian prisoners by the Israelis,
*19:08.720- 19:13.720* :  moving to a second phase, but that second phase would be subject to a negotiation
*19:14.300- 19:16.160* :  that carries on during phase one.
*19:16.560- 19:19.920* :  And then you would get a permanent ceasefire into the war
*19:20.340- 19:22.660* :  and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces.
*19:22.740- 19:25.060* :  Now that has always been the point that Hamas objected to.
*19:25.060- 19:27.940* :  They said, from the start, effectively, you have an end to the war,
*19:27.940- 19:30.440* :  permanent ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces.
*19:31.100- 19:33.860* :  My sense is, from what the Americans are saying now,
*19:33.860- 19:36.020* :  is that Hamas have conceded on that.
*19:36.020- 19:40.360* :  They would now accept, in effect, a negotiation sort of phase into
*19:41.080- 19:43.860* :  full Israeli withdrawal, permanent end to the war.
*19:43.860- 19:46.140* :  So that does feel like a breakthrough.
*19:46.520- 19:47.740* :  But it is only a breakthrough.
*19:47.740- 19:54.360* :  Remember, on getting mediated talks back up and running between the Israelis and Hamas in Doha.
*19:54.360- 19:56.820* :  So that looks like it's going to happen, probably, within the next few days.
*19:57.280- 20:01.600* :  But we're still talking, really, about weeks until anything is signed.
*20:01.640- 20:06.100* :  You know, until these two sides start any kind of truce in return for release of hostages.
*20:06.960- 20:08.180* :  Tom Bateman in Washington.
*20:10.800- 20:11.440* :  Still to come.
*20:12.020- 20:16.100* :  One thing is clear, and that is that Chinese electric car manufacturers
*20:16.100- 20:20.860* :  are able to produce electric cars much more cheaply than their European counterparts.
*20:21.020- 20:27.980* :  The European Union confirms heavy punitive tariffs on imports of Chinese-made electric cars.
*20:35.000- 20:40.420* :  The security forces in Ecuador say they've rescued 49 people who were kidnapped by the
*20:40.420- 20:44.960* :  Los Lobos criminal gang, which is involved in drug trafficking, extortion,
*20:45.340- 20:47.140* :  and illegal mining activities.
*20:47.820- 20:52.640* :  They were being held in one of the country's main gold mining areas in Aswai province.
*20:53.260- 20:54.980* :  Five bodies were found at the site.
*20:55.480- 20:59.500* :  Police and soldiers say two suspects were arrested after a shootout,
*20:59.980- 21:01.520* :  and many weapons were seized.
*21:01.520- 21:06.940* :  Rachel Wright asked our America's regional editor Leonardo Russia for more and what happened.
*21:07.560- 21:15.220* :  It was an overnight operation in this important mining area of Ecuador, the province of Aswai.
*21:15.800- 21:19.020* :  And apparently, the police and soldiers also were involved.
*21:19.020- 21:24.020* :  They were tipped off by relatives that had told that these people were working there,
*21:24.500- 21:27.180* :  being in a mine that was controlled by Los Lobos.
*21:27.600- 21:31.060* :  One, probably the country's biggest criminal gang.
*21:31.660- 21:36.120* :  And the police said when they approached, they were met by fierce resistance.
*21:36.120- 21:39.720* :  It's about 20 people firing at them and two of them were arrested.
*21:40.340- 21:44.280* :  And then they seized lots of weapons, including dynamite sticks.
*21:44.760- 21:51.240* :  And that just sheds the light on the level of criminal activity in Ecuador,
*21:52.020- 21:54.560* :  especially involving a new sector, which is the mining sector.
*21:54.780- 21:57.900* :  Yes, so tell us more about this crime wave in Ecuador.
*21:57.900- 21:59.620* :  How long has it been going on for?
*22:00.360- 22:03.780* :  Well, it's basically since the pandemic, the COVID pandemic.
*22:03.780- 22:08.140* :  Before that, Ecuador was one of the most peaceful countries in Latin America.
*22:08.920- 22:11.180* :  It doesn't produce drugs or not much.
*22:12.400- 22:16.840* :  Most of the cocaine in the world is producing neighboring countries, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
*22:17.600- 22:23.640* :  And Mexican gangs saw that as basically a gap and opportunity for them to move in.
*22:24.000- 22:25.820* :  And they made deals with local gangs.
*22:25.820- 22:32.240* :  I mean, this Los Lobos, this gang, they are linked to the new generation cartel from Mexico.
*22:32.900- 22:37.880* :  And they just went in and now Ecuador has become a major hub for drug trafficking
*22:38.360- 22:39.560* :  and other criminal activities.
*22:40.120- 22:43.900* :  And this particular incident is the tip of the iceberg,
*22:43.900- 22:48.640* :  because it shows the increasing involvement of the gangs in mining, especially gold mining.
*22:49.040- 22:51.760* :  What probably happened to these 49 people?
*22:51.760- 22:54.780* :  And there were five bodies that were found in this mining area.
*22:55.240- 23:00.460* :  What probably happened to them is the gangs came in and basically forced them to work for them,
*23:00.600- 23:04.760* :  for very little slaves or, and then happened a lot.
*23:05.220- 23:07.660* :  I mean, there are dozens of mines that are controlled by gangs.
*23:08.060- 23:11.180* :  And not only in Ecuador, but also in Peru, in Venezuela,
*23:11.180- 23:15.560* :  there's a big criminal gang from Venezuela, specializing in mining.
*23:16.060- 23:21.520* :  And especially gold mining, because they melt down this golden to gold bars.
*23:22.200- 23:27.840* :  And they can not only profit from that, but also to loan all the money that they make illegally.
*23:27.840- 23:31.980* :  So it's a big problem from Ecuador and the new president who's been in power for less
*23:31.980- 23:34.420* :  in a year has been trying to deal with that.
*23:35.000- 23:36.300* :  But it's very difficult.
*23:36.780- 23:37.700* :  Leonardo Rosha.
*23:38.340- 23:43.300* :  The European Commission has confirmed it will impose a significant increase in import taxes
*23:43.720- 23:46.700* :  on electric vehicles brought into the EU from China.
*23:47.360- 23:51.340* :  Starting on Friday, the tariffs will initially be imposed for four months,
*23:51.340- 23:54.680* :  after which member states will vote on whether to make them permanent.
*23:55.380- 24:01.060* :  The EU believes that China's electric vehicle industry receives significant state subsidies
*24:01.440- 24:02.380* :  and so is unfair.
*24:03.000- 24:05.760* :  China denies this and has threatened retaliation.
*24:06.380- 24:11.360* :  Some German car makers, particularly those with big manufacturing facilities in China,
*24:11.720- 24:13.120* :  are opposed to the tariffs.
*24:13.720- 24:17.400* :  James Menendez heard more from our business correspondent Theo Leggett.
*24:17.960- 24:22.280* :  One thing is clear, and that is that Chinese electric car manufacturers
*24:22.280- 24:27.060* :  are able to produce electric cars much more cheaply than their European counterparts.
*24:27.060- 24:33.460* :  And studies by UBS, the bank, for example, have put that gap at around 25% to 30%.
*24:34.280- 24:37.360* :  So it is clear that these cars can be made cheaply.
*24:37.360- 24:42.760* :  There are concerns then that what the European Union will see is a wave of Chinese manufacturers
*24:43.820- 24:47.840* :  dumping electric cars onto European markets, trying to get market share,
*24:48.280- 24:53.540* :  and driving existing manufacturers out of what is expected to be a growing market,
*24:53.540- 24:57.060* :  as petrol and diesel cars are phased out and electric cars become the norm.
*24:57.580- 25:01.940* :  Now, the European Commission began investigating this last year and has provisionally concluded
*25:02.500- 25:05.720* :  that these manufacturers are in receipt of a lot of government subsidies
*25:06.320- 25:10.560* :  and that therefore they're able to sell cars cheaply because they've got government support
*25:10.560- 25:11.920* :  and that is unfair.
*25:12.320- 25:15.440* :  So the idea behind the tariffs is to redress that balance.
*25:15.440- 25:22.560* :  And the tariffs will range from 17.4% for BYD, one of the up and coming electric car makers,
*25:23.160- 25:27.980* :  to 37.6% for SAIC, which owns famous brands such as MG.
*25:28.540- 25:30.740* :  And that's on top of an existing 10% tariff.
*25:30.740- 25:34.040* :  So the maximum tariff is nearly 40% to 48%.
*25:34.200- 25:35.760* :  Which is extraordinarily high.
*25:36.520- 25:40.900* :  Why then are some European car manufacturers, some of the big ones, opposed to this?
*25:41.080- 25:44.800* :  Well, because they're global players and they believe that ultimately this is not a path
*25:44.800- 25:47.280* :  they want to go down and it could be damaging to them.
*25:47.580- 25:48.900* :  Take the MW, for example.
*25:48.900- 25:54.780* :  It builds cars in China and imports them into the EU for sale to European buyers.
*25:54.780- 25:59.180* :  It does this because it knows there are cost advantages from producing cars in China.
*25:59.780- 26:02.440* :  It's going to be hit by the increased tariffs.
*26:03.060- 26:05.160* :  And it also sells cars going the other way.
*26:05.160- 26:08.600* :  It makes high-value cars that are sold on the Chinese market,
*26:08.600- 26:09.420* :  whether very popular.
*26:09.420- 26:10.580* :  It's a big market for them.
*26:11.060- 26:14.980* :  And those cars would be exposed to any sort of retaliation introduced by Beijing.
*26:15.500- 26:18.340* :  So BMW, and it's not the only European manufacturer,
*26:18.860- 26:20.900* :  thinks that this is a bad path to go down,
*26:20.900- 26:23.480* :  that while it might protect some European businesses,
*26:24.120- 26:26.540* :  there are also risks for the more globalised ones.
*26:26.540- 26:28.560* :  And Mercedes-Benz is in a similar position.
*26:28.960- 26:32.700* :  Stellantis has also stated, or the head of Stellantis has also stated,
*26:33.220- 26:35.720* :  he thinks that it's not a great idea to go down this path.
*26:36.000- 26:38.700* :  So although it's there to protect European manufacturers,
*26:38.700- 26:42.020* :  and it's designed to address the balance and make the market fairer,
*26:42.360- 26:46.500* :  it's fair to say that there's division between German manufacturers,
*26:46.500- 26:49.980* :  the German government, and French manufacturers principally,
*26:50.000- 26:52.540* :  and the French government over how you deal with this.
*26:52.780- 26:55.060* :  So the EU has pressed ahead with its policy,
*26:55.060- 26:57.540* :  but it's fair to say there's a fair amount of opposition to it.
*26:58.060- 27:01.860* :  Theo-legged. A decision by a wildlife park in Australia
*27:01.860- 27:06.120* :  to stop visitors cuddling its koalas has prompted a mixed reaction.
*27:06.520- 27:10.920* :  The lone pine sanctuary in Brisbane will instead allow people to watch the animals
*27:11.320- 27:12.440* :  in their natural habitat.
*27:12.440- 27:16.040* :  The move has been welcomed by some, but not everyone's happy.
*27:16.040- 27:19.120* :  Our Asia Regional Editor, Mickey Bristo reports.
*27:19.700- 27:23.240* :  Vladimir Putin, Taylor Swift and Roger Federer have all done it.
*27:23.760- 27:26.360* :  Had their photos taken while couldling a koala
*27:26.360- 27:29.280* :  at the lone pine sanctuary in Brisbane, Australia,
*27:30.020- 27:32.760* :  but the must-do tourist experiences now know more.
*27:33.320- 27:37.660* :  The sanctuary has decided to ban hugs with the cute furry marsupials.
*27:38.360- 27:42.440* :  The park's boss, Lyndon Discom, told Australia's nine news why.
*27:42.840- 27:45.000* :  We've received a lot of feedback from our visitors
*27:45.480- 27:47.300* :  that they want a more immersive experience,
*27:47.320- 27:49.280* :  and they want to have an educational experience.
*27:49.660- 27:52.060* :  So you get more time with the koala, you get to get
*27:52.700- 27:53.980* :  up close and personal with it.
*27:54.180- 27:56.260* :  You get to talk to our magnificent keepers
*27:56.720- 27:59.340* :  and get to understand more about this iconic species
*27:59.340- 28:00.360* :  that Australia has.
*28:00.740- 28:03.580* :  That up close and personal experience means tourists
*28:03.580- 28:05.800* :  will still be able to part the koalas,
*28:06.440- 28:09.660* :  but some park visitors told nine news they felt let down.
*28:10.040- 28:12.220* :  But this point says, when you come all the way from the UK,
*28:12.300- 28:16.200* :  one thing you think of coming here to Australia to cuddling a koala.
*28:16.460- 28:19.560* :  Can you take my kids and yeah, a little bit sad,
*28:19.620- 28:21.660* :  but I totally understand it's better for the koalas.
*28:21.740- 28:23.980* :  I wanted to take some memories of it holding it.
*28:24.440- 28:28.380* :  Koalas are under threat in Australia as their habitats are destroyed.
*28:29.100- 28:32.240* :  They're perhaps just 60,000 in the entire country.
*28:32.920- 28:35.500* :  In several states, holding one is already illegal.
*28:36.140- 28:39.780* :  Some animal rights organizations think harmful human interactions
*28:39.780- 28:41.740* :  with koalas should be banned everywhere,
*28:42.440- 28:44.720* :  and have welcomed the no hugs policy.
*28:51.860- 28:55.600* :  In one park at least, this unique and endangered creature
*28:56.160- 28:59.180* :  will now be free from the grasping hands of politicians,
*28:59.320- 29:02.540* :  celebrities and hordes of a door in tourists.
*29:03.840- 29:04.620* :  That was Mickey Bristol.
*29:05.260- 29:06.860* :  And we return to our main story.
*29:06.920- 29:10.580* :  The Labour Party is predicted to have won a landslide victory
*29:10.940- 29:12.400* :  in the British general election.
*29:12.940- 29:18.080* :  Exit polls project that it will have a majority of about 170 seats
*29:18.520- 29:21.620* :  with the conservative vote crumbling and the political career
*29:21.620- 29:23.820* :  of several cabinet ministers in jeopardy.
*29:24.260- 29:27.520* :  If confirmed, the result will be a triumph for Keir Starmer,
*29:27.660- 29:30.280* :  the man who will be Britain's next Prime Minister.
*29:30.640- 29:33.760* :  Oliver Conway spoke to our political correspondent Ron Watson again.
*29:34.240- 29:38.040* :  I think it's probably the second biggest majority in 100 years.
*29:38.400- 29:40.820* :  I mean, it really is pretty astonishing,
*29:40.820- 29:45.420* :  but I have to say, the deputy leader of the Labour Party Angela Rainer
*29:45.420- 29:46.980* :  is still being somewhat cautious.
*29:47.480- 29:50.080* :  Well, if you look at where we were in 2019,
*29:50.220- 29:52.280* :  just to get a majority of one,
*29:52.280- 29:56.460* :  we'd have had to have a swing greater than Tony Blair's in 1997.
*29:57.420- 30:01.700* :  So we know a number of seats were on an eye-fetch from our own data.
*30:02.160- 30:04.880* :  But I also know that all of our activists and our candidates
*30:05.020- 30:07.520* :  have been going out there not taking anything for granted
*30:08.100- 30:12.000* :  and speaking to the electorate about what they believe matters to them
*30:12.000- 30:13.560* :  and the concerns that they've had.
*30:13.600- 30:16.600* :  And I think the thing that kept coming back to us
*30:16.600- 30:19.680* :  was that the 14 years that Tories have been in power
*30:19.680- 30:22.000* :  and the chaos that they've had to tolerate
*30:22.000- 30:23.680* :  is that they wanted that change
*30:24.060- 30:26.700* :  and to bring about that change that their desperate far would be
*30:26.700- 30:28.020* :  an absolute privilege for me.
*30:28.040- 30:29.300* :  But I'm not counting my chickens
*30:29.980- 30:32.220* :  until we've got those results coming in.
*30:33.000- 30:34.080* :  Well, I'll be coming in soon.
*30:34.080- 30:36.260* :  That was Angela Rainer, deputy leader of Labour Party.
*30:36.260- 30:38.980* :  And it is astonishing the turnaround that's happening
*30:38.980- 30:41.000* :  a lot five years ago.
*30:41.360- 30:44.440* :  The opposition Labour Party was on its knees
*30:44.680- 30:47.360* :  and we're now looking at an entirely new era
*30:47.360- 30:49.080* :  in British politics extraordinary.
*30:49.340- 30:51.520* :  Let's look at the Conservatives five years ago,
*30:51.520- 30:56.140* :  365 seats this time if the polls correct, 131.
*30:56.780- 30:59.340* :  Yes, and that would be their worst performance since
*30:59.340- 31:02.060* :  wait for it drum roll 1906.
*31:02.540- 31:04.540* :  I mean, before the First World War,
*31:04.540- 31:06.340* :  I mean, that is the worst performance ever
*31:06.860- 31:09.760* :  since the reform of Parliament in 1832.
*31:10.360- 31:12.480* :  So, you know, this is a political earthquake.
*31:12.480- 31:15.140* :  I mean, what on earth the Conservatives do with themselves
*31:15.640- 31:17.020* :  after such a thumping defeat?
*31:17.100- 31:18.720* :  I mean, the most almighty battle
*31:19.140- 31:20.720* :  is now about to break out.
*31:20.720- 31:21.980* :  Where did it all go wrong?
*31:21.980- 31:23.320* :  What could we have done differently?
*31:23.680- 31:25.260* :  Was it something to do with the campaign?
*31:25.260- 31:27.500* :  Was it something to do with with Rishi Sunak
*31:27.500- 31:28.740* :  who's coming for much criticism?
*31:28.880- 31:30.920* :  I think the biggest problem they've been up against
*31:30.920- 31:34.180* :  is their internal divisions, their 14 years in power.
*31:34.560- 31:36.380* :  And essentially the fact that living standards
*31:36.380- 31:39.840* :  have stagnated along with all sorts of political turmoil
*31:39.840- 31:42.580* :  that I think have frankly exhausted the electorate
*31:42.580- 31:43.920* :  but don't be any doubt.
*31:43.920- 31:46.380* :  And I think Angela Rainer knew this with her tone.
*31:46.880- 31:50.220* :  You know, this is about conservative unpopularity,
*31:50.220- 31:51.660* :  not only great love for Labour.
*31:52.000- 31:54.040* :  Yeah, let's look at a couple of the other results we dealt
*31:54.040- 31:56.540* :  with the Scottish National Party with Valor a little earlier.
*31:57.060- 31:59.000* :  The Liberal Democrats, who of course were in government
*31:59.000- 32:00.340* :  in coalition in 2010,
*32:00.660- 32:02.340* :  then did very badly in 2015.
*32:02.340- 32:05.480* :  They've had a huge recovery up to 61 seats.
*32:06.000- 32:07.900* :  They have indeed, and that would suggest
*32:07.900- 32:10.320* :  that maybe the electorate is beginning to forgive them
*32:10.320- 32:12.940* :  a little bit for going into coalition with the Conservatives.
*32:13.320- 32:16.780* :  But again, I suspect that a lot of the reason they've done so well
*32:16.780- 32:18.300* :  is that they have targeted seats
*32:18.760- 32:20.760* :  where they were second to the Conservatives.
*32:20.760- 32:23.440* :  And you've probably seen an awful lot of tactical vocating
*32:23.500- 32:26.320* :  because one hates to sound like a broken record.
*32:26.800- 32:28.640* :  But this whole election, these results
*32:28.640- 32:30.240* :  are about voters thinking,
*32:30.240- 32:33.720* :  what would be the best way of giving the Conservative Party a kicking?
*32:33.720- 32:37.140* :  And the Liberal Democrats have been the beneficiaries of that as have Labour?
*32:37.440- 32:40.720* :  And one other party that also could have benefited is reform.
*32:41.560- 32:43.500* :  Yes, and that's where there is some uncertainty.
*32:43.500- 32:46.200* :  I mean, I think there's no doubt that that was the biggest development
*32:46.200- 32:50.540* :  during an otherwise utterly stuporfyingly dull election campaign
*32:50.540- 32:53.680* :  was where Nigel Farage stepped out of retirement,
*32:53.680- 32:57.020* :  the arch-Brexitier to mix it up and lead reform.
*32:57.020- 32:58.920* :  And he's very charismatic,
*32:58.920- 33:01.100* :  quite a lot of British people like him.
*33:01.100- 33:03.940* :  And I think that is what's caused chaos for the Conservatives.
*33:03.940- 33:07.680* :  And it may be that they would get as many as 13 seats,
*33:07.680- 33:09.140* :  maybe fewer, maybe more.
*33:09.140- 33:12.480* :  I mean, who knows, but it's obviously been profoundly disruptive.
*33:12.880- 33:16.900* :  One of which could be Nigel Farage himself at the eighth time of asking?
*33:17.400- 33:20.740* :  Yes, nobody could say that Mr Farage hadn't given it a good go
*33:20.740- 33:22.760* :  to try and become an MP.
*33:22.760- 33:27.500* :  I've covered quite a few of his campaigns over the last 10, 15 years.
*33:28.500- 33:30.860* :  So, yes, we'll see whether he does.
*33:31.000- 33:34.600* :  But I mean, just like he changed British politics by making Brexit possible,
*33:34.600- 33:38.540* :  he's obviously really done for the Conservatives a man of some consequence.
*33:39.240- 33:39.700* :  Rob Watson.
*33:42.260- 33:43.340* :  And that's it from us for now.
*33:43.340- 33:46.980* :  But you might have heard there's an election count going on here right now,
*33:46.980- 33:50.160* :  so we will have a special bonus edition a little later
*33:50.400- 33:52.780* :  as soon as we have something more solid to tell you.
*33:53.280- 33:56.200* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
*33:56.200- 33:57.500* :  do please send us an email.
*33:57.500- 34:01.180* :  The address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk.
*34:01.180- 34:04.820* :  You can also find us on x at global news part.
*34:04.820- 34:07.100* :  This edition was mixed by Johnny Hall.
*34:07.100- 34:09.080* :  The producer was Liam McSheffery.
*34:09.100- 34:10.720* :  Our editor is Karen Martin.
*34:11.040- 34:11.740* :  I'm Jackie Leonard.
*34:12.080- 34:13.540* :  And until next time, goodbye.
