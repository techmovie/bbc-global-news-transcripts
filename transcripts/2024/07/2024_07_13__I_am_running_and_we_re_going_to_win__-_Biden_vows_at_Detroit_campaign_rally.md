*01:23.320- 01:25.860* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:28.040- 01:32.440* :  I'm Dick Miles, and in the early hours of Saturday the 13th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:32.440- 01:37.880* :  President Biden has spoken at a campaign event in Michigan to try to shore up support,
*01:37.880- 01:43.800* :  as more Democrats urge him to abandon his bid for re-election because of concerns about his age.
*01:44.320- 01:50.240* :  Officials in Central Nigeria say at least 16 people have been killed when a two-story school building
*01:50.240- 01:56.140* :  collapsed. Kenya's president has replaced his police chief after officers shot dead dozens of
*01:56.140- 02:02.540* :  people protesting against tax hike plans last month. The BBC has been told that the gars of cease
*02:02.540- 02:07.020* :  fine negotiations being held in Qatar and Egypt have ended without success.
*02:09.300- 02:12.620* :  Also in this podcast, another way people are fighting for Ukraine.
*02:12.980- 02:18.720* :  Instead of holding up a weapon, I held up my baton and decided I could ride on the cultural
*02:18.720- 02:22.860* :  front. The Freedom Orchestra, which has begun a European tour.
*02:26.660- 02:32.860* :  President Biden flew to the US state of Michigan on Friday as he attempts to steady the nerves
*02:32.860- 02:38.260* :  of fellow Democrats and votes who are increasingly concerned about his re-election campaign.
*02:39.120- 02:42.700* :  Hours earlier, the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives,
*02:42.700- 02:48.520* :  Hakim Jeffress met the president to discuss his colleagues' worries. He's reported to have
*02:48.520- 02:54.480* :  bluntly shared their views. Nearly 20 congressional Democrats have now publicly urged Mr
*02:54.480- 02:59.780* :  Biden to withdraw after his poor TV debate performance last month with Donald Trump.
*03:00.480- 03:06.400* :  Then on Thursday, at a NATO summit, Mr Biden made two high-profile gaffes at his first
*03:06.400- 03:11.860* :  unscripted news conference for eight months. So it was against this background that the US
*03:11.860- 03:15.880* :  president addressed a Friday evening campaign rally in Detroit.
*03:18.640- 03:22.100* :  You probably noticed, there's a lot of speculation lately.
*03:22.720- 03:25.520* :  What's Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race?
*03:26.100- 03:30.680* :  Is he going to drop out? Here's my answer. I am running and we're going to win.
*03:32.220- 03:33.440* :  I'm not going to change that.
*03:36.740- 03:40.420* :  I'm the nominator of the Democratic Party, the only Democrat or Republican
*03:40.420- 03:43.380* :  as beaten Donald Trump ever. And I'm going to beat him again.
*03:48.060- 03:50.980* :  I know him. Donald Trump is a loser.
*03:54.220- 03:55.940* :  Mr Biden also had this to say.
*03:56.220- 03:59.600* :  And that butcher Putin, who I know have known for a long time,
*04:02.940- 04:07.340* :  when he invaded Ukraine, here's what Trump said. I'm not making this up either.
*04:08.080- 04:11.660* :  He called him a genius and said it was wonderful.
*04:13.060- 04:14.580* :  What in the hell is going on?
*04:16.680- 04:19.560* :  But people would rather talk about how I mix up names.
*04:20.760- 04:23.680* :  I guess they don't remember the Trump called Nikki Haley Nancy Pelosi.
*04:27.160- 04:30.880* :  Well, no. No more.
*04:33.200- 04:35.580* :  No more. No more free passes.
*04:36.480- 04:40.820* :  One of Donald Trump's biggest Republican supporters, Vivek Ramashwami,
*04:40.820- 04:47.080* :  has told the BBC's World Business Report that it is unlikely that President Biden will be
*04:47.080- 04:52.560* :  the person Donald Trump faces in November. Rahul Tandon spoke to Mr. Ramashwami,
*04:52.560- 04:59.020* :  a former candidate in the 2020 US presidential election and began by asking him for his views
*04:59.020- 05:01.820* :  on President Biden's recent media gaps.
*05:28.620- 05:32.600* :  President Biden has not effectively been really the president of the United States
*05:33.300- 05:37.040* :  in any meaningful sense. He is a figurehead for the managerial class
*05:37.100- 05:39.360* :  that's actually running the show beneath him.
*05:39.520- 05:42.240* :  And I think that's the deeper problem not just in the United States,
*05:42.240- 05:45.340* :  but across much of the modern Western, Western democracies.
*05:45.540- 05:50.060* :  Do you think that he will be the Democratic nominee come November?
*05:50.380- 05:51.060* :  I think it's unlikely.
*05:51.480- 05:53.000* :  Who will be the Democratic nominee?
*05:53.320- 05:55.620* :  Look, that's an open question. In the modern United States,
*05:55.620- 05:58.960* :  the Democratic Party has a fixation on identity politics,
*05:58.960- 06:01.720* :  the politics of race, gender, and sexuality.
*06:02.400- 06:06.120* :  As a consequence, Biden got himself what you could think of as in the corporate context,
*06:06.120- 06:09.660* :  you would call a poison pill with Kamala Harris as the vice president.
*06:10.100- 06:13.200* :  She was somebody who was wildly unpopular in the Democratic primary.
*06:13.200- 06:15.480* :  She didn't even make it to the Iowa caucus.
*06:16.040- 06:17.880* :  Yet she got selected as the vice president,
*06:17.880- 06:20.640* :  patently because of foremost her race and gender.
*06:20.640- 06:21.360* :  She's a black woman.
*06:21.940- 06:24.280* :  So the reality is, if that was the reason for choosing her,
*06:24.480- 06:25.480* :  that's now an albatross.
*06:25.480- 06:29.480* :  They can't pass over her for those attributes unless they go with somebody
*06:29.480- 06:30.780* :  else who has those same attributes.
*06:31.220- 06:35.480* :  So pragmatically, I believe there's two viable choices for who could succeed Biden this year.
*06:36.020- 06:38.540* :  It's either Kamala Harris or it's Michelle Obama.
*06:38.800- 06:42.180* :  And it'll come down to how much the Democrats are willing to really force themselves to put
*06:42.180- 06:46.040* :  the best candidate forward versus putting just another candidate to Biden forward.
*06:46.640- 06:47.460* :  And that's going to play out.
*06:47.460- 06:51.220* :  I believe in the next couple of months between now and the Democratic convention in late August.
*06:51.380- 06:53.760* :  I'm sure many people would disagree with that in terms of
*06:53.760- 06:57.260* :  identity politics, being the reason that Kamala Harris was chosen.
*06:57.260- 06:59.580* :  This is a very fiercely contested election.
*07:00.000- 07:03.340* :  Look, you may be pushing back on me because I think many Republicans are,
*07:03.340- 07:04.840* :  I think, too complacent right now.
*07:05.440- 07:08.020* :  I am a bit of a minority voice in the Republican party,
*07:08.580- 07:10.360* :  saying that complacency is not an option.
*07:10.760- 07:14.560* :  A lot of people in the Republican camp appear to be celebrating like this election is over.
*07:14.980- 07:19.200* :  I believe this election has not even yet gotten started until the Democrats really put up
*07:19.580- 07:20.540* :  their actual nominee.
*07:21.080- 07:24.320* :  So is this a foregone conclusion that one side or the other is going to win far from it?
*07:24.580- 07:27.400* :  I think this is going to be deeply contested until the very end.
*07:28.040- 07:29.240* :  Vivek Ramashwami.
*07:30.120- 07:35.380* :  The BBC has been told that the mediated Gaza cease-fire negotiations being held in
*07:35.380- 07:38.520* :  Qatar and Egypt have ended without success.
*07:39.200- 07:41.840* :  It's hoped further talks will take place in future.
*07:42.260- 07:46.520* :  Contacts between the mediators and both Israel and Hamas are due to continue.
*07:46.980- 07:49.120* :  Here's the BBC's Rusty Aboualuf.
*07:49.460- 07:56.160* :  Hamas official told the BBC that they accused the Israeli Prime Minister Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu
*07:56.420- 07:58.940* :  of sabotaging the cease-fire talks.
*07:58.940- 08:01.560* :  They said it's for his own interest.
*08:01.640- 08:03.340* :  He doesn't want this deal to go ahead.
*08:03.340- 08:05.820* :  We haven't heard back from the Israelis yet,
*08:05.820- 08:08.900* :  but this is what Hamas are accusing Israel of.
*08:09.060- 08:14.560* :  This news was very sad and very frustrating for about 2.3 million people in Gaza
*08:14.980- 08:18.060* :  who are suffering for the last nine months from this war.
*08:18.080- 08:22.760* :  And they were hoping that an agreement could put an end for the war, but not this time.
*08:23.460- 08:24.660* :  Rishri Aboualuf there.
*08:24.980- 08:28.740* :  All the statement in the Gaza cease-fire talks comes as the war rages on.
*08:28.740- 08:31.640* :  And the number of casualties continues to rise.
*08:31.660- 08:37.740* :  The Hamas-run civil defence agency and Gaza said it found around 60 bodies after Israeli troops
*08:37.980- 08:40.900* :  withdrew from parts of Gaza City on Friday.
*08:41.640- 08:47.600* :  More than 38,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands more wounded since the war began
*08:47.600- 08:48.440* :  last October.
*08:49.000- 08:51.380* :  That's according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
*08:52.080- 08:57.320* :  Virgil Keen reports now on the families in Gaza caught up in the violence from Shajaya,
*08:57.940- 09:01.860* :  scene of fierce fighting in recent days to Khan Yunus in the south.
*09:05.520- 09:09.140* :  An Israeli soldier looks down the crosshairs of his weapon and fires.
*09:09.860- 09:14.800* :  Beyond the window, the glare of the sun, the dust raised by constant explosions,
*09:15.440- 09:20.380* :  the heat bearing down on all who live in Gaza and on the swelling corpses of the dead.
*09:21.100- 09:26.400* :  This is Shajaya, north of Gaza City, and scene of some of the hardest house to house fighting
*09:26.400- 09:27.300* :  in recent days.
*09:27.940- 09:31.760* :  Israel is back fighting in a place that was supposed to have been cleared of Hamas.
*09:34.400- 09:38.420* :  This is the sound of Hamas attacking an Israeli tank farther south.
*09:39.260- 09:44.000* :  After nine months of war, there's devastation across vast suites of the Gaza Strip.
*09:44.420- 09:48.700* :  Shajaya is the latest neighborhood to see streets pulverized, houses toppled,
*09:49.120- 09:51.140* :  and its people forced to flee for their lives.
*09:51.760- 09:55.260* :  Sharif Abu Shannab has witnessed the destruction of his home.
*09:59.220- 10:00.460* :  We have been thrown in the streets.
*10:00.540- 10:02.820* :  We have no home or anything.
*10:03.540- 10:04.140* :  Where do we go?
*10:04.660- 10:09.860* :  There is only one solution and that is to hit us with a nuclear bomb and relieve us of this life.
*10:15.320- 10:19.720* :  The civil defense rescuers are working in bombed areas from Gaza City in the North
*10:19.720- 10:21.160* :  to Rafa in the south.
*10:21.760- 10:25.240* :  In the last few days, much of their time has been spent collecting bodies.
*10:25.840- 10:28.860* :  They move quickly as they fear attack by Israeli forces.
*10:29.480- 10:32.720* :  They stop in a street where a body lies next to a shop doorway.
*10:33.380- 10:35.680* :  There's another about 100 yards farther on.
*10:35.680- 10:40.020* :  Later, they lower a girl's body from the second floor of a building.
*10:40.620- 10:43.540* :  Muhammad Al-Maghair is a local civil defense official.
*10:43.880- 10:45.100* :  Those are so bad.
*10:45.200- 10:48.960* :  It is very difficult to identify the bodies of the martyrs.
*10:49.280- 10:52.360* :  Some remain unidentified because they have decomposed.
*10:52.360- 10:57.800* :  The clothes they were wearing were also destroyed by stray animals eating the bodies,
*10:58.540- 11:01.100* :  making it challenging to determine their identities.
*11:05.480- 11:10.380* :  Back in the North, refugees are leaving Gaza City to try and find safety in central Gaza.
*11:11.140- 11:12.960* :  This is the sound of a joyous reunion.
*11:13.680- 11:15.940* :  The women of the Al-Fayumi family embrace.
*11:20.120- 11:23.520* :  The boiling heat, the new arrivals are handed bottles of water.
*11:24.280- 11:26.740* :  A girl hugs her aunt, beaming with joy.
*11:27.540- 11:29.760* :  Then she turns her head and begins to cry.
*11:30.600- 11:33.580* :  Coming up the road were two teenage boys, cousins.
*11:33.580- 11:37.640* :  They'd fled alone and said they were shot at by the Israelis on the way.
*11:40.080- 11:43.340* :  The explosions, the gunfire and the bombs were too much.
*11:43.920- 11:44.820* :  I left my mother there.
*11:45.580- 11:49.080* :  Who stayed behind? My mother, my sisters and my father.
*11:49.360- 11:51.200* :  He was martyred. God rest his soul.
*11:53.800- 11:55.460* :  That report was by Fergal Keen.
*11:56.480- 12:01.640* :  At least 16 people were killed and many more injured when a two-story building housing
*12:01.640- 12:07.120* :  a school collapsed on Friday morning in Nigeria's central plateau state.
*12:07.640- 12:11.900* :  A massive search and rescue operation is underway to find students and teachers who were
*12:11.920- 12:13.060* :  still trapped in the rubble.
*12:13.400- 12:17.560* :  A correspondent, Chris Awakor gave Chris Barrow this update from Abuja.
*12:17.940- 12:25.160* :  The situation in Nigeria now is that of shock because of the magnitude of the disaster that happened
*12:25.180- 12:29.000* :  with the collapsing of the two-story building housing school.
*12:29.560- 12:33.440* :  And were told that the school hosts hundreds of students.
*12:34.040- 12:37.300* :  They were writing the exams early in the morning and that the children
*12:37.300- 12:42.600* :  were in their classes when suddenly the building caved in, falling upon the
*12:42.600- 12:44.000* :  children and their teachers.
*12:44.580- 12:50.220* :  Many were trapped, some died, and there had been excavation of the rubble,
*12:50.400- 12:55.760* :  the concrete and the twisted rods to try to remove those trapped
*12:56.280- 13:00.600* :  many were injured, rushed to hospitals and been caused by medics
*13:01.000- 13:06.860* :  for a blood donation to help save the lives of those who were seriously injured and had lost
*13:06.860- 13:07.360* :  blood.
*13:07.880- 13:10.720* :  Do we have any idea at the stage of what could have caused the collapse?
*13:10.800- 13:12.680* :  And is there a history of buildings collapsing?
*13:13.460- 13:15.880* :  Nigeria has a history of building collapse actually.
*13:15.880- 13:21.540* :  Over a long time, there have been collapse of buildings, especially in Lagos,
*13:21.540- 13:24.480* :  a southwest Nigeria, even here in Abuja.
*13:24.920- 13:30.900* :  And in most cases, they are blamed on the use of substantive materials as well as
*13:30.900- 13:37.340* :  lack of adherence to the preparations for putting up structures in Nigeria.
*13:37.340- 13:42.340* :  And it's caused a loss of lives, it's caused money and in this case,
*13:42.560- 13:47.940* :  people are also suggesting that the school building collapse could be as a result of either
*13:48.580- 13:52.280* :  a defect in the structure or use of substantive materials.
*13:52.280- 13:55.800* :  But it is actually yet to confirm that.
*13:55.800- 14:01.200* :  All attention now focused on how to save the lives of those injured
*14:01.700- 14:05.100* :  and console the parents of those who lost their children.
*14:05.520- 14:10.960* :  The Nigerian president, Bola Metubugu, has sent condolences messages to the
*14:10.960- 14:14.240* :  parents who lost their children as well as those who are injured.
*14:14.700- 14:20.240* :  And the governor of Plato State, central Nigeria, has also consoled the families.
*14:20.240- 14:27.240* :  But many Nigerians are expecting to see what action this tragedy could move the government
*14:27.240- 14:32.420* :  to take regarding how to address the incidences of building collapse in the country.
*14:33.080- 14:38.900* :  Chris A. Walker, now to a group of musicians brought together by conflict two years ago,
*14:39.300- 14:44.080* :  as the Ukrainian freedom orchestra starts their summer tour in Paris.
*14:44.080- 14:48.920* :  It was formed in response to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine and will now play
*14:48.920- 14:53.440* :  in some of the great cathedrals and concert halls of Europe and the United States.
*14:54.020- 14:55.380* :  Stephanie Prentice has this report.
*15:01.660- 15:07.220* :  Playing together, surrounded by rubble and orchestra, gathered on the ruins of a children's
*15:07.220- 15:12.160* :  hospital in Kiev, bringing moments of peace to recite decimated by war.
*15:13.780- 15:19.180* :  It's typical of the spirit of the musicians of Ukraine who refuse to stop playing despite
*15:19.180- 15:26.300* :  constant bombardment. Instead of holding up a weapon I held at my baton and decided I could
*15:26.300- 15:31.940* :  write on the cultural front. Karylin Wilson, who's of Ukrainian descent, is the creator of the
*15:31.940- 15:37.040* :  Ukrainian freedom orchestra. It's been playing since the start of the conflict and as you
*15:37.040- 15:42.660* :  Ukrainian's fight for the freedom of their country on the battlefield, Karylin sees music as another
*15:42.660- 15:50.620* :  type of resistance. The group's world tour is opening with a piece dedicated to the Butcher
*15:50.620- 15:56.640* :  massacre which was uncovered in the first few months of the invasion and which Karylin had first
*15:56.640- 16:03.760* :  hand experience of. They also visited Butcher. It was absolutely horrified. So I decided that this
*16:03.800- 16:10.260* :  work, which are lacrimals. It's a beautiful piece because not only does it have the emotion of pain,
*16:10.260- 16:16.160* :  which I really want audiences to hear, but there's a message from the hope and it ends with
*16:16.160- 16:23.300* :  these beautiful rising arpeggios in the silver violin. It's a symbol of the eternal power of good.
*16:23.860- 16:29.780* :  The musicians are mostly refugees or have special permission to be away, but while they may be
*16:29.780- 16:36.820* :  away from home while touring, home is never far away for them. Sometimes because of tears I can play
*16:36.820- 16:43.140* :  normally because you're checking the news from the from the mobile phones and you're trying to play
*16:43.140- 16:49.840* :  and you see the the signs, you see the notes, the some words, but your mind is still with those
*16:49.840- 16:55.340* :  pictures from Kiev and you can't stop tears. One of the messages the orchestra wants to get
*16:55.340- 17:01.700* :  across is that of awareness reminding the international community that Ukraine needs their help
*17:01.700- 17:09.120* :  and reminding Ukrainians that help is coming. It's a message of power of beauty and good
*17:09.120- 17:15.640* :  over evil and not really what our orchestra is and it's a message that the Ukrainian spirit won't die.
*17:17.780- 17:21.500* :  Stephanie Prentice reporting on the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra.
*17:21.680- 17:28.680* :  Still to come. We usually are very reluctant to diagnose people with narcissistic personality
*17:28.680- 17:34.920* :  disorder prior to age 21 because in adolescence we consider narcissism to be a very good thing.
*17:35.040- 17:41.860* :  In adulthood not. In adulthood is dysfunctional. Well now new research suggests that narcissistic people
*17:41.860- 17:54.800* :  actually get more agreeable with age. Hey I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile we like to do the

*19:09.920- 19:14.700* :  And that means they have to allow people who are in fear of their lives or other persecution
*19:14.700- 19:21.480* :  to claim asylum. Now Finland signed that convention but it's just adopted a new law which would
*19:21.480- 19:27.820* :  allow officials to turn away asylum seekers. It follows a surge of people arriving on Finland's
*19:27.820- 19:34.160* :  eastern border. Helsinki's accused Russia of instrumentalizing migration that's deliberately
*19:34.160- 19:40.800* :  using refugees for political gain. Nevertheless the UNHCR regional representative for the Nordics
*19:40.800- 19:47.800* :  and Baltics Annika Sundland is worried about this new law. The idea behind it is really to combat
*19:47.800- 19:54.040* :  instrumentalization and sort of send a signal to Russia and many of the Finnish politicians have
*19:54.040- 19:59.580* :  been very clear on saying that this is this is the aim of the bill is to send the signal to use
*19:59.580- 20:06.440* :  again refugees and migrants in in the sort of game. And the concern from our side is that it allows
*20:06.440- 20:11.160* :  for the denial of access to territory and asylum which is one of the sort of fundamental principles
*20:11.160- 20:16.700* :  of refugee law. Are Europe regional editor Charles Havelin tell me more about the implications
*20:16.700- 20:23.360* :  of this new law? What it means is that for a period of a year to start with in certain parts of
*20:23.360- 20:29.500* :  the border the border guards will have the discretion to turn people back asylum seekers arriving from
*20:29.500- 20:34.360* :  Russia whether they be Russian nationals or nationals of other countries such as Syria and Somalia
*20:34.360- 20:39.740* :  are two that have been mentioned in contrast to what the UN agencies are saying the Finnish government
*20:39.740- 20:46.360* :  is saying that this will apply in scenarios where there is a threat to the national security of Finland.
*20:46.360- 20:52.580* :  It says that whether you like it or not it as a government is looking after the security of the
*20:52.580- 20:59.760* :  country and that of the European Union because the Finnish border with Russia more than 1300 kilometers
*20:59.760- 21:05.220* :  is the longest national border of any EU country with Russia. And that's how they get around the
*21:05.220- 21:10.780* :  fact that their signature is to the refugee convention so there are obliged to hear asylum claims
*21:10.780- 21:16.700* :  but they say because of national security this law trumps them. Yeah it's not to say that there
*21:16.700- 21:23.620* :  hasn't been opposition within Finland it is being dubbed deportation law by its opponents and one
*21:23.620- 21:28.820* :  parliamentarian and opposition parliamentarian said after the adoption of this law by parliament
*21:28.820- 21:34.780* :  that it's a sad day for Finnish rule of law and human rights and she accused the government
*21:34.780- 21:40.640* :  of acting in violation of its own stated understanding that the law does run contrary to both EU
*21:40.640- 21:45.460* :  law and international human rights law. And part of the government's claim that this is about
*21:45.500- 21:53.320* :  national security refers to instrumentalising migration on the part of Russia. What do they mean by that?
*21:53.680- 21:58.160* :  What I think they mean is that they accuse Russia of deliberately if you like encouraging them to
*21:58.160- 22:05.600* :  cross into Finland saying that this has particularly become an issue after Finland joined NATO much to
*22:05.600- 22:12.940* :  Moscow's dismay which was in 2023 and was a direct result as far as we can tell of the Russian
*22:12.940- 22:17.900* :  full scale invasion of Ukraine. Now interestingly enough Russia's closest ally Bielorus was
*22:17.900- 22:23.960* :  accused of the same before the Russian invasion of Ukraine back in about 2021 it was accused by
*22:23.960- 22:30.800* :  governments of its border countries such as Poland and Lithuania of bringing people to the border
*22:31.420- 22:36.900* :  and literally trying to push them across the border. Now Moscow denies that there is any such
*22:36.900- 22:41.760* :  instrumentalisation policy and has been very critical of recent Finnish move to tighten up the
*22:41.760- 22:49.780* :  border controls. Charles Havelent. China claims huge areas of the South China Sea as its own territorial
*22:49.780- 22:56.160* :  waters. It's not afraid to use its full military and diplomatic heft to enforce that.
*22:56.800- 23:01.720* :  And in recent months that has brought it into conflict with the Philippines. Beijing is demanding
*23:01.720- 23:09.120* :  now that Manila withdraws its coast guard in that area called the Sabina Shoal. Manila says it won't
*23:09.120- 23:14.480* :  back down. Our Asia Pacific regional editor Mickey Bristow told me more. There's been several
*23:14.480- 23:19.040* :  confrontations between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea over the last year.
*23:19.540- 23:26.020* :  We've had confrontations in the Scarborough Shoal, the second Thomas Shoal. Now we've opened up
*23:26.020- 23:32.500* :  what looks like a fresh front at the Sabina Shoal. An area in the South China Sea in the
*23:32.500- 23:38.940* :  Spratley Islands. Earlier this year the Philippines claimed that China had been damaging coral reef
*23:39.220- 23:44.620* :  at the Shoal and they think that was a way to prepare the ground in order to build an artificial
*23:44.680- 23:50.360* :  island. So what the Philippines has done since April, it's stationed at least one large coast guard
*23:50.360- 23:57.480* :  vessel at Sabina Shoal and that's been there permanently. What's happened today is China said,
*23:57.480- 24:03.040* :  look, leave the area. We've got sovereignty over the area. So it looks like this is another part
*24:03.040- 24:06.880* :  of the South China Sea which could be to conflict between China and the Philippines.
*24:06.880- 24:12.720* :  So you say that China is claiming sovereignty over that area but it's much closer to the Philippines
*24:12.720- 24:17.760* :  than it is to China. What's the legality of Beijing's claim? Like many of the islands
*24:18.180- 24:21.640* :  China claims in the South China Sea they're closer to other countries than the
*24:22.560- 24:27.400* :  Chinese mainland. So in this particular case we have an international court rule in the permanent
*24:27.400- 24:33.160* :  court of arbitration which ruled actually eight years ago to this date, the eighth anniversary
*24:33.640- 24:39.800* :  and it said China's claims in the South China Sea famously contained within a nine-dash line
*24:39.800- 24:46.940* :  were essentially just not valid at all. So China according to the international court has no claims
*24:47.000- 24:53.580* :  to this particular area in the South China Sea, China rejects that court ruling. In fact today
*24:53.580- 24:59.860* :  on this anniversary it said that ruling was a political fast dressed up in legal garb. So that's
*24:59.860- 25:05.720* :  what China thinks about it but certainly as far as international law is concerned that's on the
*25:05.720- 25:12.100* :  side of the Philippines. So Mickey, how dangerous is this current standoff? There is real potential for
*25:12.100- 25:18.880* :  this to be a flash point. This situation could escalate both sides of chosen not to do so but that
*25:18.880- 25:24.240* :  could happen. Also the Philippines has military alliances with the United States. Most importantly
*25:24.240- 25:30.160* :  they could also be drawn into this. So it's a really dangerous situation which hasn't turned into
*25:30.160- 25:37.580* :  anything too serious yet but that's the potential. Mickey, Bristol. New research suggests that
*25:37.580- 25:44.040* :  narcissistic people get more agreeable with age. With the findings into the personality traits
*25:44.040- 25:50.500* :  seen since the 1980s as a medically diagnosable disorder is published by the journal Psychological
*25:50.500- 25:57.060* :  Bulletin. It is based on data from 51 existing studies and it indicates that people who have an
*25:57.060- 26:02.200* :  shakeable belief that they're better or more deserving than others are likely to mellow the
*26:02.200- 26:08.980* :  older they get. Paul Henley spoke to Sam Vacnin, an author and professor of clinical psychology
*26:08.980- 26:14.640* :  at the Commonwealth Institute of Advanced and Professional Studies. He describes himself on a
*26:14.640- 26:21.140* :  social media account as a self-admitted diagnosed narcissist and he takes issue with quite a lot
*26:21.140- 26:25.800* :  of the research. The methodological problem with all these studies, previous and current,
*26:26.500- 26:30.680* :  is that they actually don't deal with narcissism. They don't deal with people who have been
*26:30.680- 26:36.440* :  diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. The vast majority of these studies deal with people
*26:37.020- 26:43.600* :  who are possessed of what is known as a narcissistic style or in the more extreme case people
*26:43.600- 26:50.260* :  with a dark triad personality. Now this is a bit like the relationship between the common cold
*26:50.740- 26:56.200* :  and life-threatening pneumonia and most of these studies are unable to secure the participation
*26:56.200- 27:00.860* :  and the collaboration of people with narcissistic personality disorder because antagonism
*27:01.080- 27:06.560* :  is one of the main features of narcissists and so they never collaborate well, especially not in
*27:06.560- 27:12.800* :  studies. And you believe that narcissistic traits in childhood can actually be a positive attribute,
*27:12.960- 27:18.920* :  don't you? Narcissism in childhood and adolescence is considered to be healthy. It is the foundation
*27:18.920- 27:23.820* :  of self-esteem and self-confidence and the ability to regulate one's sense of self-worth.
*27:24.260- 27:30.380* :  Actually there's no identity without narcissism. Narcissism is a kind of self-preoccupation which
*27:30.380- 27:36.580* :  gradually coalesces into the formation of an identity. We usually are very reluctant to
*27:36.580- 27:42.420* :  diagnose people with narcissistic personality disorder prior to age 21 because in adolescence
*27:42.420- 27:48.360* :  we consider narcissism to be a very good thing. In adulthood not. In adulthood is dysfunctional,
*27:48.420- 27:54.740* :  it holds you back. Narcissism is a series of nine problems. Number one, they lack empathy.
*27:54.740- 28:00.260* :  Number two, they fear intimacy in our incapable of dealing with it. Number three, they have
*28:00.260- 28:05.400* :  identity problems. They don't know exactly who they are. Number four, they are antagonistic.
*28:05.400- 28:12.060* :  They're conflict prone and envious. Number five, they seek attention. They use attention to
*28:12.060- 28:17.140* :  regulate their own sense of self-esteem and self-confidence and self-worth. Number six,
*28:17.140- 28:23.200* :  they're grandiose. They have an inflated, fantastic self-perception and self-image. Number seven,
*28:23.200- 28:29.100* :  they are dissocial. They are anti-social. In other words, they're a bit psychopathic. They're a bit
*28:29.100- 28:34.680* :  on the border between legal and illegal legitimate and illegitimate behavior. Number eight,
*28:34.680- 28:40.940* :  they are obsessive-compulsive and number nine, they have what is known as negative effects. In
*28:40.940- 28:47.460* :  other words, they are besieged and consumed by negative emotions, such as anger, rage, envy,
*28:47.460- 28:54.060* :  hatred and so on. And do you recognize anything in this claim that the severity of these conditions
*28:54.060- 29:00.980* :  eases with age? There are rigorous studies that support the claim that antagonism in narcissism
*29:01.420- 29:07.720* :  ameliorates with age and not only in narcissism, also in psychopathy and also in borderline
*29:07.720- 29:13.000* :  personality disorder. The tendency to conflict with people, the tendency to abuse them and to
*29:13.000- 29:18.200* :  attack them, to undermine them aggressively or possibly aggressively, to externalize aggression
*29:18.200- 29:23.900* :  and to express it and to render it a kind of ideological spine. I'm aggressive, therefore I'm
*29:23.900- 29:30.300* :  superior. I'm aggressive, therefore I'm wonderful. This ameliorates with age and not only in narcissism.
*29:30.720- 29:36.680* :  And we think that's something to do with biology or with genetics. We think there's a hereditary
*29:36.680- 29:42.060* :  component definitely in psychopathy and borderline and we increasingly believe that narcissism
*29:42.520- 29:48.540* :  does have a hereditary component and that antagonism is a psychobiological or psychosocial
*29:48.540- 29:53.960* :  biological issue. In other words, it's something to do with the body or the brain as well as
*29:53.960- 30:00.140* :  the behavior. However, there is no support for any other claim. For example, there's absolutely
*30:00.140- 30:07.140* :  noticeable for the claim made in the meta-study that empathy increases among narcissists with
*30:07.140- 30:13.980* :  the lifespan. Sam Vachnin, author and professor of clinical psychology. Now, they're one of the
*30:13.980- 30:20.960* :  most recognizable sites in Britain, the famous red postboxes. Now, the first one to carry
*30:20.960- 30:27.760* :  King Charles's Slyther, a kind of stylized initials, has been unveiled in southern England.
*30:27.760- 30:34.700* :  Postboxes have a longstanding tradition, first appearing in Queen Victoria's reign in 1852.
*30:35.280- 30:40.020* :  Claire Runeckers has this report. As the King is representative in the county of Cambridge here,
*30:40.060- 30:44.700* :  it gives me great pleasure to unveil the first postbox of a Carolian era.
*30:46.520- 30:50.040* :  A crowd of people gathered to see the first monogrammed postbox in the Cambridge
*30:50.040- 30:56.340* :  of Great Campbell. Marked out in gold are the overlapping initials CR for Charles Rex.
*30:56.340- 31:01.220* :  Inside the R, the Roman numerals for three, all under a chewed a crown.
*31:01.720- 31:07.000* :  It's just over 170 years since the writer Anthony Trollop, who was working for the post office,
*31:07.000- 31:13.140* :  suggested the use of postboxes. The first had Queen Victoria's cipher on them. They were hexagonal
*31:13.200- 31:18.220* :  and painted dark green. The ciphers have stayed, but their colour changed quite quickly to a more
*31:18.220- 31:23.480* :  distinctive red. Many are still in use today as Chris Taft from the post office museum explains.
*31:23.940- 31:26.880* :  They're not replaced when a new monocle comes to throw, new boxes are introduced.
*31:26.900- 31:31.940* :  So this is the first that we see of Charles III, but you can still walk the streets and see
*31:31.940- 31:36.220* :  boxes from every monocle. The first letter posted today was fitting the address to the King
*31:36.220- 31:40.380* :  and was from local schoolchildren. Robert said they had a shared passion.
*31:40.700- 31:45.420* :  Didn't my let try ask the King whether he has any tips about taking care of the environment?
*31:45.960- 31:49.660* :  The King cipher will now be applied to the doors of Royal Mail's fleet of vehicles.
*31:49.660- 31:54.020* :  The first 100 setting out today, with many more in the weeks to come.
*31:54.500- 31:56.400* :  That report by Claire Runacus.
