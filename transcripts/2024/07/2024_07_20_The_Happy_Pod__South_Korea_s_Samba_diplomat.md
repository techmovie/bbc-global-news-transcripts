*00:54.460- 00:59.540* :  when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our
*00:59.540- 01:04.340* :  prices due to not hating you. That's right. We're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30

*01:26.480- 01:32.680* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in this edition, uploaded on Saturday the 20th of July, a diplomat with a difference.
*01:36.640- 01:43.800* :  I enjoyed singing songs from the countries where I served, but in Brazil, I suddenly become
*01:43.820- 01:50.220* :  popular more than I expected. Videos of the South Korean ambassador singing
*01:50.220- 01:55.820* :  Samba have gone viral as the Paris Olympics approach will hear about the athletes competing
*01:55.820- 02:01.220* :  after fleeing their own home countries. When I participated and became a part of the
*02:01.220- 02:05.760* :  refugee and a big team, I understood that it's actually way bigger than just a metal.
*02:06.520- 02:12.360* :  There's good news for a critically endangered crocodile in Cambodia. This is the most significant
*02:12.360- 02:18.760* :  boost to resaving the species through natural reproduction that we have witnessed in the country.
*02:19.260- 02:24.120* :  Also in this podcast has Dublin seen the biggest swift quake so far.
*02:26.780- 02:33.860* :  We think we can see Jacob at a seismometer which is located about 113 km away. That is obviously
*02:33.860- 02:42.240* :  very impressive. And I love cultivating hope, happiness and joy. I want to broaden the reach of
*02:42.240- 02:49.000* :  help and positivity through my own experiences. Why a man who can't speak or move after a stroke
*02:49.000- 02:59.700* :  at the age of 16 is now working to mentor children. We start with an unusual music sensation in Brazil.
*03:12.560- 03:18.240* :  This is no ordinary Samba star. In fact, this singer is also South Korea's ambassador in
*03:18.240- 03:24.480* :  Brazil. Lim Gibo, who's 59, has been winning over the Brazilian people with a series of viral
*03:24.480- 03:31.100* :  videos and is even performed at one of Rio's most illustrious Samba spots. He told Jason Lee,
*03:31.100- 03:35.740* :  he started singing publicly to try to lift people's spirits during the pandemic.
*03:36.700- 03:44.280* :  The society was rather gloomy so at the auto events, I sang Brazilian songs rather than
*03:44.560- 03:46.260* :  giving boring speeches.
*03:57.800- 04:04.640* :  After that, people kept asking me to sing and it has been like this until today. People posted
*04:04.640- 04:12.360* :  videos of my songs on their social media. Some of them garnering billions of views and likes.
*04:12.380- 04:19.380* :  Still, I'm receiving likes and beautiful comments so I'm very happy and grateful.
*04:19.860- 04:23.940* :  You performed at a renowned Samba club in Rio de Janeiro this April.
*04:30.620- 04:31.580* :  How was that experience?
*04:32.940- 04:38.600* :  Before that, I happened to meet a singer named Gabriel at a reception organized
*04:38.700- 04:47.180* :  Bayerov, which is a hero. After a few years, Gabriel invited me to sing together in his part.
*04:54.220- 05:00.280* :  I guess it was a small bar and we didn't prepare. It was a spontaneous show. Actually,
*05:00.280- 05:07.460* :  I enjoyed Samba with their famous group, Samba de Trabaliadores and with a large audience.
*05:08.300- 05:10.160* :  It was such a good moment in my life.
*05:13.800- 05:16.720* :  What's your response to all the positive reactions you've been getting?
*05:17.020- 05:26.020* :  I'm not a good social media, as I said. There are sometimes when I feel guilty for not being able
*05:26.020- 05:33.680* :  to respond properly. Recently, people who were hospitalized called the embassy and thanked
*05:33.680- 05:42.700* :  for me because they become cheerful after watching my singing video. I was also invited to sing
*05:42.700- 05:49.120* :  for patients at a cancer hospital. I was happy that the patients lacked my singing.
*05:49.320- 05:51.980* :  What makes Brazilian music so special to you?
*05:52.380- 06:00.240* :  In Brazil, far away from Korea, I see Brazilian music as heading similarities with Korean songs.
*06:00.780- 06:04.740* :  In particular, there are a lot of silly love songs in the lyrics.
*06:05.420- 06:10.100* :  So it was not difficult for me to sing them. My wife might find it embarrassing,
*06:10.100- 06:18.220* :  but the time I spent singing in karaoke by and so have to be allowed in successfully singing Brazilian songs.
*06:18.800- 06:26.240* :  Anyway, Brazilian music makes me happy and Brazilian people seem to accept it as an expression
*06:26.240- 06:34.700* :  of my joy, a lawful Brazil. So I advise you sing Brazilian songs in Brazil and you will be long.
*06:35.000- 06:38.560* :  Happy always enjoyed singing even before taking off Brazilian music.
*06:39.000- 06:45.020* :  As a career diplomat, I enjoyed singing songs from the countries where I served.
*06:45.500- 06:49.800* :  I used to sing not only English, pop songs, but also Spanish and Chinese.
*06:49.800- 06:55.660* :  The songs contain the language, culture and emotions of the country.
*06:56.180- 06:59.440* :  But in Brazil, I think I sing a little too much.
*06:59.740- 07:01.860* :  Why do you say you sing too much in Brazil?
*07:03.720- 07:07.060* :  I suddenly become popular more than I expected.
*07:13.200- 07:16.520* :  What sort of next for you with Samba and in your singing journey?
*07:17.040- 07:25.460* :  Next. I don't have a specific plan, but I will continue to love Samba and Brazilian music.
*07:25.940- 07:31.980* :  So I will continue to sing. Samba and Brazilian songs makes me feel happy.
*07:46.620- 07:49.640* :  Samba, sensation and diplomat, Lim Quimou.
*07:50.660- 07:55.420* :  The Olympic Games in Paris are right around the corner and this year there are 36 athletes
*07:55.420- 08:01.140* :  representing the world's displaced population of more than 100 million people forming the
*08:01.140- 08:06.560* :  Refugee Olympic team. In our special episode of the Happy Pot at the Global Refugee Forum
*08:06.560- 08:11.460* :  back in December, we met the team's chef-demission, an Afghan woman who fled her country,
*08:11.840- 08:15.900* :  and then went on to represent refugees at the Tokyo Games in 2021.
*08:16.740- 08:19.640* :  Harry Blire has been hearing the stories of those taking part.
*08:21.980- 08:27.420* :  It wasn't our choice to leave our countries, but we are passionate about sport.
*08:27.420- 08:33.260* :  This is Massama Ali Zada, an Olympic cyclist at the Tokyo Games, and this year's
*08:33.260- 08:37.940* :  chef-demission of the Refugee Olympic team. This is her in December,
*08:38.300- 08:42.200* :  speaking to the International Olympic Committee shortly after being selected.
*08:44.400- 08:47.920* :  Personally, I think every refugee in the world should have the right to do this,
*08:48.660- 08:53.600* :  because it's important to have a team that allows refugees who've been forced to leave their
*08:53.600- 08:56.100* :  country to participate in the Olympics.
*09:00.020- 09:05.260* :  And this was the moment last week when the Refugee Olympic team arrived at the training camp
*09:05.620- 09:07.540* :  in Bayer in northwestern France.
*09:10.480- 09:16.800* :  One of the 36 athletes representing the team is the Cuban weightlifter Ramero Mora Romero.
*09:17.300- 09:23.040* :  He's fulfilling a long time promise of competing at the Olympics to his parents who died when
*09:23.040- 09:28.960* :  he was young. Unusually, Romero began his career in the circus in Cuba, performing as an
*09:28.960- 09:35.260* :  aerialist. A career he continued in the UK after moving there as part of a circus group in 2019.
*09:36.320- 09:42.460* :  In 2023, Romero was granted asylum in the UK and is now the British weightlifting record holder
*09:42.460- 09:50.000* :  in the 89, 96 and 102 kilogram categories. Now, he's been selected to represent the Olympic
*09:50.000- 09:58.540* :  Refugee team. I received one email and they say the we tell the team to go to the Olympic
*09:58.540- 10:04.940* :  game. I mean, say, oh my god, it's amazing. I go to the church, put the flower for my mom,
*10:04.940- 10:08.820* :  because that's the promise. I'm so happy and now training for the Olympic game.
*10:10.500- 10:19.280* :  Here are the athletes of the IOC Refugee Olympic team Paris 2024. Manija Talash breaking.
*10:19.580- 10:26.400* :  Manija Talash is the only female break dancer or breaker representing Afghanistan. She fled
*10:26.400- 10:32.820* :  the country when the Taliban seized power in August 2021 and now lives in Madrid, where she's
*10:32.820- 10:40.840* :  also been selected to be part of this year's team. By going to the Olympics, I want to show that
*10:40.840- 10:46.580* :  Afghan girls will never surrender. They will win despite any challenge or obstacle.
*10:47.080- 10:53.100* :  For Yuzra Mardini, this year's Olympics are special. In 2016, she competed in swimming
*10:53.100- 10:59.640* :  for the first ever refugee team at the Rio Olympics. But this year, Yuzra is taking up a different
*10:59.640- 11:05.960* :  role. She's a UN goodwill ambassador and will be working as a reporter telling the stories of
*11:05.960- 11:11.140* :  current refugee athletes. When I participated and became a part of the refugee Olympic team,
*11:11.140- 11:14.920* :  I understood that it's actually way bigger than just a medal.
*11:15.260- 11:21.620* :  Originally from Damascus, she fled the Syrian civil war when she was 17, alongside her sister.
*11:21.620- 11:29.800* :  Their story was made into a film The Swimmers in 2022. In 2020, she swam again for the refugee
*11:29.800- 11:36.680* :  Olympic team in the women's 100-meter butterfly and carried the refugee team flag in the opening
*11:36.680- 11:41.960* :  ceremony. We're saying anyone and everyone can do this sport and when you're here, the Olympics
*11:41.960- 11:46.640* :  doesn't matter where you come from. It matters that you put in the hard work. You're here to live
*11:46.640- 11:51.880* :  your dream, which is sport, which is participating, which is competing. And this is the beauty of the
*11:51.880- 11:58.460* :  Olympics, whether you're a refugee or not. Former Olympic swimmer and UN goodwill ambassador Yuzra
*11:58.460- 12:06.480* :  Mardini, ending that report by Harry Bly. Now, in 2002, a group of Italian gamers got together
*12:06.480- 12:11.920* :  to chase a dream. They wanted to release a video game for the cutting-edge technology of the time,
*12:11.920- 12:18.460* :  the Game Boy Advance. They had no experience, but a lot of enthusiasm. That didn't last long,
*12:18.460- 12:24.440* :  though, and one by one, the group disbanded. But now, 22 years later, the only remaining
*12:24.440- 12:30.580* :  original member Fabio Belzanti has finally managed to get his game called Kien published.
*12:30.580- 12:37.680* :  It holds the record for most delayed release in video game history. So, what took so long? Fabio
*12:37.680- 12:44.540* :  has been speaking to Chris Barrow. We were the first Italian company to develop one for Game Boy Advance,
*12:44.540- 12:51.120* :  but we were really crazy people. No one of the founders was a programmer. That's a fun thing,
*12:51.440- 13:00.380* :  but with a lot of will we go on. And after two years, we reached the final game, but the problems
*13:00.380- 13:06.020* :  was that the game could not be published for market reasons.
*13:11.340- 13:21.760* :  How did the game eventually get released? The game was in our archive from 2008-2009.
*13:22.580- 13:29.740* :  We tried here and there to see if we can port it to mobile, to the phones, but each time
*13:29.740- 13:36.800* :  it was not possible, because we had to make other projects to survive, because we are a very,
*13:37.940- 13:47.420* :  very in the company. So, we have always the hell on our heels. But after so many years,
*13:47.440- 13:56.860* :  the ritual gaming market became reality. And so, from there, a new opportunity arise to publish
*13:57.180- 14:06.000* :  Kien could see the delight after so many years. So, how easy is it for someone like me to play Kien?
*14:06.080- 14:12.160* :  Do I have to go and dig out my Game Boy Advance from the attic? Yes, you must have the Game Boy
*14:12.160- 14:19.820* :  Advance to play it, or you can emulate it on PC. It's a piece of archeology, so it's an object,
*14:20.320- 14:26.600* :  an artifact. You have to relate with it, not like any other game, but like a piece of history.
*14:32.200- 14:37.680* :  Dare I ask, are there plans for a Kien 2? I know it's just been released in that sense,
*14:37.700- 14:40.820* :  because it may take another 20-something years to come up.
*14:42.400- 14:51.660* :  I don't know, now that I'm not very young, I hope. Kien 2 depends what will happen with this release.
*14:51.740- 15:00.900* :  We started to build a demo that is named an Australian equilibrium, and we hope to finish and release
*15:01.480- 15:08.140* :  it in less years, because now we have this record, and it's okay to have just one record in this field,
*15:08.140- 15:15.660* :  not more than this. Fabio Belzanti speaking there to Chris Barrow, and Kien is out now for the Game Boy
*15:15.660- 15:22.540* :  Advance, if you still have one that works, that is. And now to a remarkable comeback in Cambodia
*15:22.540- 15:27.880* :  that's boosted hopes one of the world's rarest reptiles. After years of conservation efforts,
*15:27.880- 15:33.760* :  a record number of a critically endangered type of crocodile has been born. Stephanie's
*15:33.760- 15:43.740* :  Accreson has the details. In a nesting Cambodia, a remote card of a month and hidden away in the
*15:43.740- 15:49.800* :  forest, the newly hatched baby crocodiles are crawling over the eggs that just a short while ago were
*15:49.800- 15:56.520* :  their homes. This is a key natural habitat for the endangered siamese crocodile, but deforestation
*15:56.520- 16:02.360* :  and poaching have devastated the population. Researchers say there are now only around a thousand
*16:02.420- 16:08.620* :  of them worldwide, and only a few hundred in the world. So it was a choice discovery when a couple
*16:08.620- 16:14.920* :  of locals came across five nests in the forest. They reported their finding to the conservation team
*16:14.920- 16:20.920* :  at the Fauna and Flora Cambodia programme, which is run by Pablo Sinavath. This is the most
*16:20.920- 16:27.380* :  significant boost to resaving the species through natural reproduction that we have witnessed in
*16:27.380- 16:32.080* :  the country, the centuries certainly. The team quickly mobilised to ensure the nests were protected
*16:32.080- 16:37.740* :  around the clock, with rangers watching out for poachers who supply eggs and adult reptiles to
*16:37.740- 16:44.220* :  crocodile farms, where their skins are turned into luxury belts, shoes and humbugs. Their efforts
*16:44.220- 16:51.380* :  proved successful when 60 out of the 66 fertilised eggs hatched. It's incredibly encouraging because
*16:51.380- 16:56.520* :  it shows that conservation work that has been taking place over the past two decades is having the
*16:56.520- 17:03.040* :  results that we would hope, and as these hatchlings reach the maturity of the next decade or so,
*17:03.500- 17:10.360* :  then we would expect the breeding in the wild to grow densely exponentially, and that's where we
*17:10.460- 17:17.060* :  want to get you. The olive green freshwater crocodile has a distinct bony clast at the back of its head
*17:17.580- 17:22.400* :  and can grow up to three metres. In the conservation programme, the psyonese crocodiles
*17:22.400- 17:27.300* :  are bred in captivity and then released into suitable habitats across the national park.
*17:28.040- 17:34.280* :  The birth of these new baby crocs is believed to be a record in the wild. A moment of hope for a
*17:34.280- 17:44.140* :  species that was listed as virtually extinct three decades ago. The crocodiles and Stephanie's
*17:49.340- 17:54.940* :  Accreson. Coming up in this podcast, when tourists come to our village, they bring another
*17:54.940- 18:00.760* :  source of income. This allows us to teach our traditions to our children, giving them the

*19:25.300- 19:30.060* :  A few weeks ago here on the HappyPod, we heard how Taylor Swift fans around the world
*19:30.060- 19:34.940* :  have been dancing and clapping so much they've literally been making the earth move.
*19:35.580- 19:40.780* :  And nowhere more it seems than in the Irish capital Dublin, where the joy of the audience for
*19:40.780- 19:46.500* :  her era's tour show could be felt more than 100 kilometres away. Eleanor Dunn has been studying
*19:46.500- 19:52.640* :  the seismic impact of the tour as a way to break down barriers between science and pop culture.
*19:53.240- 19:58.060* :  Eleanor, the geophysics PhD student at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies,
*19:58.060- 20:03.220* :  told the HappyPod's Holly Gibbs about the results. After looking at the data, we've actually
*20:03.680- 20:09.380* :  managed to pick up what we think is shake it off in the Dublin mountain, which is about 14
*20:09.380- 20:20.100* :  kilometres away. And then also we think we can see shake it off in at a seismometer which is
*20:20.100- 20:28.960* :  located about 113 kilometres away in Wexford. So that is obviously very impressive to see the concert
*20:29.280- 20:35.660* :  being picked up that far away. The concert was definitely very energetic and the Swifties were
*20:35.660- 20:40.660* :  definitely causing a lot of seismic activity. I have no doubt about that. That's slightly
*20:40.660- 20:46.000* :  different isn't it to the other shows, the song Shake It Off? Yes, so in comparison to Ed and
*20:46.000- 20:50.620* :  Brooke, we actually think that love story was the song that generated the highest seismic
*20:50.620- 20:55.680* :  amplitude, which was very different. We look at the data and then we see where was this really high
*20:55.680- 21:01.500* :  energy that was created. And we think we can actually narrow it down to one of the lines in love
*21:01.500- 21:07.200* :  story. So when she says any note to the ground and pulled out a ring and said marry me Juliet.
*21:13.580- 21:18.920* :  And everyone kind of screams that line and goes crazy for it. So we actually think that that was
*21:18.920- 21:24.900* :  the point when there was this really high seismic amplitude. And we think because everyone kind of
*21:24.900- 21:30.060* :  starts jumping at that particular point, that's why it had such a big impact. It would be great
*21:30.060- 21:34.760* :  to look at all the different taste of concerts around Europe as she's currently moving around
*21:34.860- 21:40.080* :  and seeing if these songs do change based on the location. And if I mean Dublin Swifties really
*21:40.080- 21:45.460* :  just have a unique music taste compared to the rest. You said when you set out that you wanted to
*21:45.460- 21:51.060* :  use this to help better communicate science, do you think you've achieved that and how do you
*21:51.060- 21:55.720* :  think that you're going to use these results to break down the barriers between pop culture and
*21:55.720- 22:00.360* :  science? The response has been really great and I think we have definitely started to break down
*22:00.360- 22:06.160* :  that barrier. So obviously it's still a long way to go. I definitely want to work on perhaps more
*22:06.160- 22:12.400* :  concerts that are happening around Dublin. Maybe even look at football matches or rugby matches and see
*22:12.400- 22:17.920* :  what sort of methods we can use to talk to those particular fans and what really works for them
*22:17.920- 22:23.620* :  for getting interested in and becoming citizens seismologists. Do you think this is the way to make
*22:23.620- 22:29.280* :  science relatable by breaking it down and putting it in the fans terms if you will? Combining
*22:29.280- 22:35.600* :  pop culture with science is always a great way to go because it is something that people are so
*22:35.600- 22:41.240* :  passionate about. If you communicate with them in the right way and they are interested then that's
*22:41.240- 22:47.000* :  definitely the way to go with future science projects. And on a personal level how has it been
*22:47.100- 22:52.940* :  carrying out this experiment? It's been amazing. I never thought I would be able to incorporate
*22:52.940- 22:59.720* :  Taylor Swift into my geophysics-based PhD. Eleanor Dunn speaking there to reporter and
*22:59.720- 23:07.140* :  Swiftie, Holly Gibbs. Tourism is worth a staggering 10 trillion US dollars to the global economy
*23:07.580- 23:12.580* :  but most of the money goes to big international travel firms. So how can the people living in the
*23:12.580- 23:18.280* :  areas visited reap the benefits? Well a few weeks ago we heard how indigenous tribes in Colombia
*23:18.280- 23:24.820* :  were using tourism to regain and protect their ancestral lands. Now another scheme in Thailand
*23:24.820- 23:30.280* :  is also aiming to benefit local communities, kickstarting their economies by organising people
*23:30.280- 23:36.780* :  into small companies that can borrow money to create experiences for tourists. The social enterprise
*23:36.780- 23:43.720* :  called Localalike then runs tours to those areas. William Kramer has been to the village of Pontai
*23:44.020- 23:48.480* :  which managed to secure a loan of a hundred thousand dollars. He found out more.
*23:50.740- 23:55.740* :  So I'm just coming to this little area here where there's a couple of ladies with a loom. Long
*23:55.740- 24:02.340* :  has always woven mats for herself but now she's starting to teach visitors. Long is going to show me how
*24:02.340- 24:10.300* :  to make a key ring. I've taught tourists to make them and they're always happy to take their finished
*24:10.300- 24:16.300* :  products home with them. They seem to re-enjoyed experience. Localalike has been working here in Pontai
*24:16.300- 24:22.020* :  for a year and a half. I take a walk through the village with Somsak Bunkan whose nickname is Pai.
*24:22.660- 24:31.220* :  He's the founder of the organisation. The silk factory is another local attraction for curious tourists.
*24:34.900- 24:40.120* :  I actually enjoy it when they come and look around. It gives me a chance to share my knowledge and
*24:40.120- 24:49.140* :  it's rewarding. When tourists come to our village they bring another source of income. This allows us
*24:49.360- 24:54.860* :  to teach our traditions to our children giving them the opportunity to work here and stay close to
*24:54.860- 25:00.900* :  home instead of having to leave and find work elsewhere. Pontai is located a seven hour drive
*25:00.980- 25:06.900* :  north-east of Bangkok. Pai has honed in on the region's unique cuisine to draw people in.
*25:07.720- 25:12.840* :  It's so great. Some ladies have just brought in round secular trays and they're all full of dishes
*25:12.840- 25:18.960* :  with their beautiful looking salads. This is very, very Instagramable. Normally we have a chef
*25:19.300- 25:25.060* :  like a young generation chef in Bangkok to come and teach and train them how to do the decoration.
*25:30.540- 25:36.040* :  Mix with the red ant. With what? Red ant. Red ant. Okay let's try it.
*25:37.920- 25:42.120* :  In the old days people in this village ate this dish when they were feeling under the weather.
*25:42.780- 25:49.180* :  It's said that the ants release a liquid which wets the appetite. To be honest the ants don't really
*25:49.180- 25:54.540* :  have a strong flavour but they do make for a great traveller's tale. Something to remember
*25:55.160- 26:01.860* :  maybe boast about in a hostel back in Bangkok. There is also another advantage to having
*26:02.520- 26:09.560* :  a really strong structure in place. They've had a well for years but the water from it wasn't clean.
*26:09.880- 26:14.620* :  The villagers had to go to the next village to buy their water and then they had to bring it back.
*26:15.340- 26:20.280* :  The bank was willing to give them that big loan and the village has used that money to dig three
*26:20.280- 26:26.780* :  more wells and install a filtration system. I took a look at it with Pi and also with the woman
*26:26.780- 26:39.700* :  who's responsible for running the new system. Moe. Now we only pay five baht and it used to cost
*26:39.700- 26:45.540* :  13 baht. The villagers don't just use the water themselves. They now sell it on to neighboring
*26:45.540- 26:50.860* :  villages. That money goes back into the village company but it's not just the well. The fund is
*26:50.860- 26:56.780* :  paid for community kitchens and a redesigned village square. So far there's only been about 30 tourists
*26:56.780- 27:02.860* :  to the village but the community is already benefiting. And you can hear more on that story on people
*27:02.860- 27:09.340* :  fixing the world wherever you get your podcasts. And finally to a rather unusual book written with
*27:09.340- 27:16.440* :  the help of a computer that tracks eye movement. Howard Wicks had a stroke aged just 16 that's left
*27:16.440- 27:21.380* :  him with what's called locked in syndrome where he's fully conscious and his mind isn't affected
*27:21.380- 27:28.620* :  but he can't speak on mover muscle except those in his eyes. Howard who's now 29 meant as children
*27:28.620- 27:34.280* :  and says he wants to be able to inspire and educate others. He can only communicate using what's
*27:34.280- 27:40.320* :  called an eye gaze computer controlled by tracking the glint in his eye. So he used that to write
*27:40.320- 27:47.220* :  his book and to tell us about his life. This condition has profoundly impacted my daily life
*27:47.220- 27:54.200* :  making every physical activity or job impossible and preventing me from communicating impulsively
*27:54.200- 28:00.700* :  with those around me. It's one of the most agonizing and frustrating aspects of this condition.
*28:02.360- 28:09.660* :  It took me about 18 months to write just over 50,000 words. I think that's actually quite quick.
*28:10.500- 28:16.440* :  Throughout that time I barely stopped because I couldn't enjoy myself until it was complete.
*28:17.320- 28:25.440* :  Now at last I can enjoy life again. My book recounts the first four years following my stroke.
*28:26.220- 28:32.220* :  The initial chapter introduces the reader to my life before the stroke, allowing them to understand
*28:32.220- 28:39.700* :  who I was. This is the first installment in a trilogy. The books will invite readers to join me on
*28:39.700- 28:44.540* :  this miraculous journey and share in the many experiences I've had along the way.
*28:46.240- 28:53.200* :  I love cultivating hope, happiness, and joy and showing children how I embody these qualities
*28:53.200- 29:00.040* :  despite how I am. I want to broaden the reach of help and positivity through my own experiences
*29:00.140- 29:06.380* :  and I believe that helping children is the starting point in achieving a better future for all.
*29:07.460- 29:13.420* :  And if you'd like to know more about Howard Wicks or Locked-in Syndrome, you can find him on Instagram.
*29:18.340- 29:22.740* :  And that's it from the happy pod for now. We'd love to hear from you. If you have any stories
*29:22.740- 29:29.580* :  to share that will make us all smile. As ever, the address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk.
*29:30.360- 29:35.400* :  This edition was mixed by Pat Sissons, the producers were Holly Gibbs and Rachel Bulkley,
*29:35.400- 29:40.660* :  the editor as ever is Karen Martin. I'm Valerie Sanderson until next time. Bye-bye.
*29:54.060- 30:01.200* :  We all know what that music means. It's time for the Olympics in Paris. I'm Matt Rodgers and
*30:01.200- 30:06.740* :  I'm Bowen Yeigh. And we're doing an Olympics podcast? Uh, yeah. We're hosting the two guys
