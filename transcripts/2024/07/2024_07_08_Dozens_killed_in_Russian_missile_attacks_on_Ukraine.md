*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*00:30.740- 00:32.320* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.

*01:30.740- 01:37.280* :  I'm Rachel Wright and at 1,300 hours GMT on Monday 8th of July, these are our main stories.
*01:37.340- 01:43.020* :  Russia attacks Ukrainian cities with missiles and hits a children's hospital in Kiev.
*01:43.780- 01:48.480* :  Politicians in France argue over who should lead the country following inconclusive elections
*01:48.940- 01:52.220* :  with the leftist coalition slightly ahead of the other parties,
*01:52.920- 01:56.960* :  Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of criminal fraud conspiracy.
*02:00.080- 02:06.260* :  Also in this podcast, what's behind the killings of elderly people in Kenya accused of witchcraft?
*02:06.800- 02:11.940* :  It's all about inheriting, acquiring land resources properties, you know?
*02:12.380- 02:17.280* :  And how a new scoring system is aiming to make artistic swimming more exciting,
*02:17.700- 02:19.020* :  just in time for the Olympics.
*02:24.060- 02:28.960* :  But first, the war in Ukraine will take centre stage when NATO Chiefs meet in Washington
*02:28.960- 02:30.160* :  over the next few days.
*02:30.780- 02:34.080* :  In Ukraine itself though, the war returned with a vengeance today.
*02:40.320- 02:42.680* :  That was the scene at a children's hospital in Kiev,
*02:42.680- 02:48.740* :  as local residents using their bare hands helped the emergency workers scouring the rubble for survivors.
*02:49.280- 02:52.280* :  The city's mayor, Vitaly Tlitchko, visited the scene.
*02:55.640- 02:58.380* :  The staff is doing everything they can to clear the rubble.
*02:58.700- 03:00.560* :  There are already some dead.
*03:00.560- 03:03.180* :  That number is being clarified.
*03:03.760- 03:07.720* :  There are also hits in other parts of the city, in other locations.
*03:07.740- 03:11.860* :  We do not yet have clear information about the number of dead and wounded,
*03:11.860- 03:14.260* :  because that work is still underway.
*03:15.120- 03:21.040* :  We are doing everything we can, taking children to other hospitals in our city to show them help.
*03:24.100- 03:27.740* :  The president of the Vladimir Zelensky, who's in Poland, gave this short update.
*03:28.460- 03:37.900* :  The buildings, down the stand, the rescue progression is ongoing.
*03:40.260- 03:41.960* :  So far we know about 27 people.
*03:45.880- 03:48.900* :  And I would like to ask you, and thank you for that opportunity.
*03:50.380- 03:54.280* :  To my community of silence, in the memory.
*03:55.080- 04:00.680* :  The hospital was one of dozens of targets struck as a wave of Russian missiles hit the country.
*04:00.680- 04:06.060* :  I asked the Russia editor of BBC Monitoring Vitaly Tlitchko to give us more details.
*04:06.940- 04:07.640* :  It's really awful.
*04:07.800- 04:13.560* :  Ahmed did was Ukraine's biggest and best hospital for children,
*04:14.180- 04:15.760* :  and now parts of it destroyed.
*04:16.380- 04:20.740* :  The Ukrainian health minister, Viktor Lushko, he was at the scene,
*04:20.740- 04:25.960* :  and he said that the intensive care can see units, as well as the hospitals,
*04:25.960- 04:29.000* :  operating theatres, have been damaged.
*04:29.000- 04:32.980* :  So far, two people have been confirmed dead at the scene.
*04:33.340- 04:37.080* :  Both adults, one of them, a doctor at the hospital,
*04:37.080- 04:45.460* :  but what we're seeing at the scene are crowds, hundreds of people sifting through the rubble,
*04:45.520- 04:48.220* :  delivering water to rescue workers.
*04:48.220- 04:51.840* :  People believed to be still trapped under the debris.
*04:52.380- 04:55.300* :  A couple of hours after the initial strike,
*04:55.300- 04:59.120* :  there was another missile attack on the Ukrainian capital Kiev.
*04:59.740- 05:03.740* :  In that attack, four people were killed, also at a hospital, another hospital in Kiev.
*05:04.320- 05:07.060* :  So these are just two attacks that happened this morning,
*05:07.060- 05:10.480* :  in the Ukrainian capital elsewhere in Ukraine.
*05:10.480- 05:13.720* :  More than 20 people were killed in other cities,
*05:13.720- 05:15.460* :  such as Nipro and Kraviri.
*05:16.160- 05:18.520* :  So it's a truly horrific morning for Ukraine.
*05:18.960- 05:22.900* :  And what about on the front lines, where there are no TV cameras?
*05:22.900- 05:23.840* :  What's happening there?
*05:24.280- 05:27.620* :  The fighting is still continuing, it's bloody, it's difficult,
*05:27.620- 05:30.720* :  because it's getting really hot in eastern Ukraine.
*05:30.720- 05:35.040* :  But neither side has been able to make much progress,
*05:35.040- 05:36.860* :  but that's not for the lack of trying.
*05:37.240- 05:41.300* :  And there's been a lot of background noise this past week with diplomatic maneuverings,
*05:41.300- 05:44.780* :  especially the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n.
*05:45.100- 05:47.000* :  How is that likely to go down in Kiev?
*05:47.380- 05:48.860* :  After what happened this morning,
*05:48.860- 05:52.080* :  I don't think that Ukrainians are going to be any more willing
*05:52.080- 05:54.660* :  to sit down and negotiate with Russia,
*05:54.660- 05:59.400* :  who they say has attacked them, betrayed them repeatedly.
*05:59.500- 06:03.360* :  The promises that were made by Vladimir Putin, they were not kept.
*06:03.360- 06:06.900* :  So Ukrainians say, what's the point of sitting down and talking
*06:06.940- 06:10.260* :  if Russia is going to, if it takes a pause,
*06:10.540- 06:13.640* :  it's going to take that pause to restock and resupply itself,
*06:13.640- 06:14.860* :  and then attack again.
*06:14.860- 06:18.400* :  So what I'm seeing coming from Ukraine is a lot of anger
*06:18.860- 06:21.600* :  as well as determination to survive.
*06:21.600- 06:23.660* :  It's as simple as that, it's a battle for survival.
*06:24.420- 06:27.740* :  Vitaly Shevchenko, in our earlier podcast,
*06:27.740- 06:31.240* :  we brought you the news that the far-right national rally in France
*06:31.240- 06:33.200* :  had been beaten into third place.
*06:33.720- 06:37.380* :  An alliance of far-left parties had come out on top,
*06:37.860- 06:39.380* :  albeit without a majority.
*06:39.960- 06:41.640* :  Now France is in deadlock.
*06:42.060- 06:45.440* :  The election plunged the country into political uncertainty.
*06:45.440- 06:47.900* :  The Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal,
*06:48.180- 06:49.440* :  has tended his resignation,
*06:49.440- 06:52.280* :  but President Macron, the man who appointed him,
*06:52.540- 06:53.400* :  asked him to stay.
*06:53.900- 06:56.620* :  Speaking late on Sunday, the founder of National Rally,
*06:56.620- 07:00.380* :  Marine Le Pen, said the projected results were bad for France.
*07:04.840- 07:07.840* :  The quagmire that I warned about has, of course, come true.
*07:08.480- 07:11.000* :  France will be totally blocked with three groups
*07:11.000- 07:14.100* :  that have more or less the same influence in the national assembly.
*07:14.840- 07:16.780* :  Well, we're going towards that, it's sad.
*07:17.440- 07:20.220* :  We're losing one more year, one more year of unregulated
*07:20.220- 07:23.700* :  immigration, one more year of losing purchasing power,
*07:24.220- 07:27.640* :  one more year of blowing up on insecurity in our country.
*07:28.280- 07:30.380* :  Charlotte Minvier was a green candidate,
*07:30.380- 07:33.060* :  a part of the far-left alliance in the election.
*07:33.500- 07:36.840* :  She said France had voted to prevent chaos in the country.
*07:37.680- 07:40.520* :  We've avoided an absolute disaster for France,
*07:41.040- 07:42.240* :  putting aside the far-right,
*07:42.800- 07:44.660* :  and our party leaders came together
*07:44.660- 07:46.080* :  with great responsibility,
*07:46.640- 07:48.860* :  forming this alliance on a solid program
*07:48.860- 07:51.220* :  for social justice and environmental justice.
*07:51.900- 07:53.720* :  And it's, of course, really good news
*07:53.720- 07:55.200* :  that we've been placed first
*07:55.540- 07:57.720* :  and in the possibility of forming our government
*07:57.720- 08:00.000* :  to really try and change people's lives
*08:00.000- 08:03.120* :  after several years of women and Macron's government.
*08:03.840- 08:05.120* :  So, a lot to take in.
*08:05.440- 08:08.580* :  The BBC's Christian Fraser has been going through the newspapers
*08:08.580- 08:12.100* :  and seeing how the French press are processing the shocking results.
*08:13.120- 08:15.480* :  France waking up this morning to an election result
*08:15.480- 08:18.100* :  it could hardly have predicted a week ago.
*08:18.100- 08:21.360* :  And that is very much reflected in the morning papers.
*08:21.360- 08:23.140* :  No question who came out on top.
*08:23.140- 08:26.140* :  It is the new popular front of Jean-Luc M√©lenchon.
*08:26.520- 08:27.620* :  La croix this morning.
*08:27.620- 08:30.080* :  France stops the rally,
*08:30.440- 08:33.480* :  the Republican rally of Marine Le Pen,
*08:33.700- 08:37.180* :  La Figaro, the rally is stopped,
*08:37.180- 08:40.940* :  the left imposes itself on President Macron.
*08:41.620- 08:43.880* :  But maybe the headline of the day in La Parisia.
*08:44.400- 08:46.460* :  And now, what are you going to do?
*08:46.800- 08:49.560* :  And that is the question for Emmanuel Macron.
*08:49.560- 08:52.520* :  Certainly there is celebration on the left
*08:52.520- 08:56.080* :  because the coalition that came together to stop the rally
*08:56.480- 08:57.960* :  just four or five weeks ago
*08:58.220- 09:00.260* :  has had an extraordinary success.
*09:00.260- 09:05.100* :  You see in these results that the party has 182 seats.
*09:05.200- 09:06.280* :  But a word of caution.
*09:06.280- 09:09.560* :  It was quite remarkable last night that Jean-Luc M√©lenchon
*09:09.880- 09:12.740* :  right out of the trap said that he now had a mandate
*09:12.740- 09:14.820* :  to form the next government and should be
*09:15.240- 09:17.540* :  negotiating who becomes the prime minister.
*09:17.540- 09:18.880* :  But when you look at that group,
*09:19.360- 09:21.040* :  it is quite disparate.
*09:21.080- 09:23.420* :  So, the socialists almost have as many seats
*09:23.420- 09:26.240* :  as France and Sumis, the party of Jean-Luc M√©lenchon.
*09:26.260- 09:27.760* :  Then there are the communists and the Greens
*09:27.760- 09:28.880* :  who also have seats.
*09:28.880- 09:30.880* :  And it was notable that actually the leaders
*09:30.880- 09:33.820* :  didn't come together on stage last night.
*09:33.820- 09:37.300* :  It was an electoral pact, maybe not necessarily
*09:37.300- 09:38.920* :  a legislative pact.
*09:39.400- 09:41.600* :  Certainly the Republican front worked,
*09:41.600- 09:43.140* :  what they call the Republican front.
*09:43.240- 09:45.240* :  So the third party candidates around the country
*09:45.240- 09:47.760* :  dropping out to give centrist candidates,
*09:48.500- 09:49.700* :  centre-rights, centre-left candidates
*09:49.700- 09:51.740* :  a better chance against the rally.
*09:51.740- 09:55.580* :  And that has worked relegating the rally into third place.
*09:55.780- 09:58.580* :  But what we have now are three groups
*09:58.580- 10:00.780* :  that practically detest each other
*10:01.080- 10:03.920* :  and no sign of any compromise in the national assembly.
*10:04.260- 10:07.520* :  France doesn't work well when it comes to coalition politics
*10:08.000- 10:09.840* :  and no sign yet in the morning papers
*10:10.400- 10:12.480* :  as to who might be prepared to compromise
*10:12.480- 10:15.720* :  to find a government to lead in the next year.
*10:16.380- 10:17.860* :  Christian Fraser in Paris.
*10:18.780- 10:21.260* :  For years Boeing was synonymous with flying
*10:21.260- 10:22.600* :  and flying safely.
*10:22.960- 10:25.600* :  But today the company says it will plead guilty
*10:25.600- 10:29.360* :  to a criminal fraud charge and pay a huge fine
*10:29.460- 10:32.420* :  rather than face a trial on felony criminal charges
*10:32.420- 10:34.140* :  to defraud the United States.
*10:34.840- 10:38.540* :  This all dates back to the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft
*10:39.100- 10:41.440* :  which changed the image of the company radically.
*10:42.060- 10:45.020* :  Two fatal crashes involving the 737 MAX
*10:45.020- 10:48.040* :  led to the deaths of 346 people
*10:48.480- 10:50.560* :  and the grounding of all of the aircraft
*10:51.200- 10:52.860* :  then the company was found to have forced
*10:52.900- 10:54.420* :  through defective software
*10:54.860- 10:55.920* :  which caused the crashes.
*10:56.320- 10:57.180* :  An earlier this year,
*10:57.480- 11:00.320* :  a door plug blew out of the 737 MAX plane
*11:00.320- 11:03.720* :  leading to the grounding of all the aircraft once again.
*11:04.240- 11:06.400* :  Theo legate of our business staff told me more.
*11:07.280- 11:10.540* :  Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a felony fraud charge.
*11:10.620- 11:12.620* :  Now that's a serious criminal charge
*11:13.280- 11:15.920* :  and it relates back to what happened five years ago
*11:16.080- 11:18.380* :  when two Boeing 737 MAX aircraft,
*11:18.380- 11:21.340* :  Boeing's newest design crashed within months
*11:21.340- 11:24.020* :  of one another killing 346 people.
*11:24.560- 11:27.080* :  Now those planes were equipped with flight control software
*11:27.080- 11:28.660* :  that had been developed rapidly,
*11:29.260- 11:30.400* :  had been certified,
*11:30.580- 11:32.400* :  sorted by pulling the wool over the eyes
*11:32.400- 11:34.740* :  of American regulators
*11:35.280- 11:36.740* :  and it was defective.
*11:36.780- 11:38.140* :  Now in the wake of those accidents,
*11:38.800- 11:40.800* :  Boeing was charged with a criminal fraud
*11:40.800- 11:42.500* :  for attempting to deceive regulators
*11:43.060- 11:46.180* :  but reached a deferred prosecution agreement with prosecutors
*11:46.660- 11:48.900* :  which meant that it escaped any sort of trial
*11:48.900- 11:51.400* :  or being found guilty of any criminal charge
*11:51.400- 11:54.100* :  as long as it agreed to clean up its act
*11:54.100- 11:56.360* :  and to modify its internal processes.
*11:57.020- 11:58.160* :  Now earlier this year,
*11:58.460- 12:00.820* :  there was another serious incident involving
*12:00.820- 12:03.320* :  the same family of aircraft, the 737 MAX,
*12:03.320- 12:06.400* :  in which an unused door plug fell off a plane
*12:06.820- 12:08.920* :  shortly after takeoff and in the wake of that
*12:08.920- 12:12.100* :  it emerged that the door probably hadn't been fitted properly
*12:12.500- 12:13.700* :  and there were other allegations
*12:13.940- 12:16.780* :  of poor quality controls within Boeing's factories.
*12:17.060- 12:19.100* :  So that was enough for the Department of Justice
*12:19.100- 12:20.840* :  to reopen its original case
*12:21.020- 12:23.940* :  to bring forward this criminal felony charge again
*12:24.220- 12:26.680* :  and in this time, Boeing hasn't got away with it.
*12:26.860- 12:28.920* :  Will Boeing be able to survive this?
*12:29.260- 12:32.080* :  Although Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge,
*12:32.080- 12:33.440* :  it could have been a lot worse
*12:33.720- 12:35.520* :  and what families of those who died
*12:35.520- 12:36.960* :  in the two accidents are saying
*12:37.040- 12:39.180* :  is that this is another sweet heart deal
*12:39.180- 12:41.260* :  between Boeing and the Department of Justice.
*12:41.820- 12:43.900* :  It's paying $244 million
*12:44.580- 12:45.940* :  for a company the size of Boeing
*12:46.320- 12:47.420* :  that's next to nothing.
*12:47.740- 12:49.420* :  It will have an official monitor
*12:49.420- 12:52.680* :  in its factories to check that the kind of reforms
*12:52.680- 12:54.760* :  to its safety and ethics practices
*12:55.040- 12:56.780* :  that the courts require are implemented.
*12:56.880- 12:59.740* :  But again, it's not a huge amount of interference
*12:59.740- 13:01.180* :  in its day-to-day work.
*13:01.480- 13:02.640* :  So what the families are saying
*13:02.700- 13:04.500* :  is that this is a slap on the wrist,
*13:04.500- 13:07.300* :  letting Boeing get away with it once again.
*13:07.540- 13:09.440* :  So what do the families actually want then?
*13:09.620- 13:11.980* :  Well, their lawyer wrote to the Department of Justice
*13:12.060- 13:15.400* :  about a month ago saying that Boeing should receive
*13:15.400- 13:17.200* :  the biggest penalties the law allowed
*13:17.360- 13:19.400* :  and they concluded that this could include
*13:19.400- 13:21.860* :  fines of up to $24 billion.
*13:22.940- 13:25.240* :  And they also said they wanted to see individuals
*13:25.480- 13:27.620* :  who had been at a high level within Boeing
*13:27.620- 13:29.080* :  at the time those accidents occurred
*13:29.520- 13:30.920* :  face individual prosecution,
*13:31.260- 13:32.460* :  particularly Dennis Mullenberg,
*13:32.500- 13:33.780* :  who at the time of those accidents
*13:33.780- 13:34.960* :  was the chief executive.
*13:35.400- 13:37.440* :  Now that's pretty clearly not going to happen,
*13:37.720- 13:38.860* :  but it does show the difference
*13:39.220- 13:40.840* :  between what the Department of Justice
*13:40.840- 13:42.880* :  is saying enough to persuade Boeing
*13:42.880- 13:44.580* :  to reform its safety culture
*13:44.980- 13:46.880* :  and what relatives of those who died
*13:46.880- 13:47.880* :  and the accidents want
*13:47.880- 13:49.900* :  in order to hold the company to account.
*13:50.360- 13:52.740* :  But Boeing is a massive, massive company
*13:53.120- 13:55.500* :  and it's also one of the only two major manufacturers
*13:55.500- 13:57.480* :  of large commercial jets anywhere in the world.
*13:57.900- 14:00.800* :  That means that Boeing is certainly too big to fail
*14:00.800- 14:02.280* :  or too big to be allowed to fail
*14:02.540- 14:04.180* :  and arguably critics would say
*14:04.460- 14:07.100* :  it's too big to be held to account properly as well.
*14:07.760- 14:09.840* :  Our business correspondent Theo Leggett,
*14:10.360- 14:12.780* :  the Lebanese economy took a massive hit
*14:12.780- 14:15.600* :  after a banking collapse wiped out people's savings
*14:16.100- 14:19.420* :  and hyperinflation made the local currency nearly worthless.
*14:20.080- 14:22.680* :  Now the country relies heavily on US dollars,
*14:23.220- 14:24.700* :  but this has caused problems
*14:24.700- 14:26.840* :  as trust in the financial system
*14:26.840- 14:28.220* :  is at an all-time low.
*14:28.720- 14:30.500* :  Here's our reporter Hannah McCarthy.
*14:32.660- 14:35.160* :  A stack of US dollar notes is being counted
*14:35.160- 14:37.740* :  by a machine at a money exchange in Beirut.
*14:38.200- 14:40.860* :  The official currency in Lebanon is the Lebanese lira,
*14:41.300- 14:43.600* :  but since the banking collapse in 2019,
*14:43.600- 14:46.920* :  the local currency has lost almost all of its value.
*14:47.480- 14:49.780* :  Today, the largest lira denomination,
*14:49.780- 14:53.520* :  a 100,000ira note, is worth just over $1.
*14:54.360- 14:57.520* :  Lebanese trust in the banking sector is at an all-time low,
*14:58.180- 15:00.780* :  explains Beirut-based economist Rosalie Berthier.
*15:01.380- 15:03.640* :  People have close to zero trust in the system
*15:03.820- 15:06.600* :  because they deposit their money and now it's gone.
*15:06.600- 15:11.040* :  Majd Masri, the president of Lebanon's syndicate for money exchanges,
*15:11.580- 15:13.960* :  says the economy now largely runs on cash.
*15:14.320- 15:15.720* :  So everything has been dollarized.
*15:15.720- 15:18.080* :  All the services and everything is in dollars.
*15:18.560- 15:22.260* :  For banks in Lebanon are not obliged to accept old or torn notes,
*15:22.760- 15:25.300* :  unlike in the US, where banks have to take notes
*15:25.300- 15:27.040* :  if half the bill is identifiable.
*15:27.620- 15:30.500* :  He says in Lebanon, people are having to pay an extra fee
*15:30.500- 15:32.660* :  for old and worn dollar notes to be shipped
*15:32.660- 15:34.080* :  to the US Federal Reserve.
*15:34.500- 15:37.840* :  It could cost up to $5 for $100 bills,
*15:37.840- 15:39.620* :  which would amount for a 5%.
*15:40.020- 15:42.240* :  Money changers now routinely iron notes
*15:42.240- 15:43.640* :  and cover up small tears.
*15:44.080- 15:45.980* :  But no matter how clean or new the notes look,
*15:45.980- 15:49.180* :  economist Rosalie Berthier says they're difficult to use
*15:49.180- 15:51.060* :  for large or overseas transactions.
*15:51.780- 15:54.020* :  If you need to buy a supply from outside,
*15:54.020- 15:55.860* :  if you do need to do large transactions,
*15:55.860- 15:57.320* :  it becomes much more complicated.
*15:58.100- 16:00.800* :  Several companies have launched digital wallets recently
*16:00.800- 16:02.520* :  to make online payments easier,
*16:02.520- 16:05.080* :  but many people in Lebanon are suspicious of them.
*16:05.500- 16:09.300* :  People have a trust issue with anything other than having cash.
*16:09.860- 16:12.680* :  Debra McConway, the co-founder of Digital Wallet
*16:12.680- 16:14.280* :  and Payments Company, Mojo,
*16:14.640- 16:16.940* :  says overcoming that barrier is a struggle.
*16:17.480- 16:19.560* :  It's not going to be something overnight that will happen.
*16:19.980- 16:21.520* :  She says it's about showing people
*16:21.520- 16:23.220* :  how they can use digital payments.
*16:23.600- 16:25.520* :  We're trying to create that ecosystem
*16:26.220- 16:28.580* :  of where you can go to any shop, restaurants,
*16:28.700- 16:30.940* :  filling stations, grocery stores.
*16:31.700- 16:33.480* :  But Rosalie Berthier doesn't believe
*16:33.480- 16:36.400* :  digital wallets alone can restore trust in banking.
*16:37.100- 16:38.940* :  The trust you have in your sector
*16:39.480- 16:42.100* :  depends on what the central bank
*16:42.100- 16:44.320* :  and whatever authorities exist,
*16:44.320- 16:47.560* :  except to take the risk and cover for default.
*16:47.760- 16:51.680* :  In Europe, your deposits are up to a certain amount.
*16:52.240- 16:53.060* :  They are guaranteed.
*16:53.580- 16:55.060* :  In Lebanon, it's not guaranteed.
*16:55.780- 16:57.200* :  She says until that happens,
*16:57.200- 17:00.660* :  the trust-lost in Lebanon will not be easily regained.
*17:05.720- 17:06.980* :  Still to come on this podcast,
*17:06.980- 17:09.180* :  why salmon fishing has been banned
*17:09.560- 17:11.820* :  in several rivers and lakes in Scandinavia.
*17:21.080- 17:23.500* :  This is the story of how a group of people
*17:23.500- 17:25.840* :  brought music back to Afghanistan
*17:25.900- 17:30.340* :  by creating their own version of American Idol.
*17:31.560- 17:33.160* :  The joy they brought to the nation.
*17:33.660- 17:34.860* :  You're free completely.
*17:35.280- 17:36.880* :  No one is there to destroy you.
*17:37.180- 17:38.860* :  The danger they endured.
*17:39.280- 17:41.480* :  It felt my head should be cut off.
*17:42.300- 17:43.120* :  I'm John Legend.
*17:43.740- 17:47.120* :  Listen to Afghan Star on the iHeartRadio app
*17:47.320- 17:48.980* :  or wherever you get your podcast.
*17:56.720- 17:58.640* :  BBC Africa Eye has discovered
*17:58.640- 18:00.800* :  that at least one elderly person
*18:00.800- 18:03.800* :  is losing their life every week on the Kenyan coast
*18:04.220- 18:05.600* :  in the name of witchcraft.
*18:06.200- 18:08.460* :  Violence against people accused of being witches
*18:08.460- 18:10.640* :  is not uncommon across much of Africa.
*18:11.140- 18:13.960* :  But human rights groups say the 70 also deaths
*18:13.960- 18:16.360* :  each year in Kenya's Killifee County
*18:16.680- 18:19.680* :  are being driven by more than fear of the supernatural.
*18:20.260- 18:22.980* :  BBC Africa Eye investigates the true motives
*18:22.980- 18:24.600* :  behind these brutal attacks
*18:25.080- 18:27.360* :  and reveals that many of these elderly people
*18:27.360- 18:29.720* :  are being targeted by the very people
*18:29.720- 18:32.000* :  who should be protecting them, their families.
*18:32.580- 18:35.100* :  And there are parts of this report by Najeri Mawangi
*18:35.480- 18:37.960* :  that describe, in detail, the physical abuse
*18:38.360- 18:39.200* :  suffered by victims.
*18:45.760- 18:48.220* :  I wasn't born this way, you know.
*18:49.740- 18:51.700* :  Katana was attacked with a machete
*18:52.020- 18:53.620* :  after being called a witch.
*18:54.600- 18:56.280* :  He's in his ali-60s.
*18:56.820- 18:59.140* :  His attackers cut off both his hands.
*19:01.320- 19:02.620* :  They cut off one of my arms.
*19:03.640- 19:05.060* :  Then they cut the other arm.
*19:06.060- 19:08.660* :  The way I am now, I can't do anything.
*19:09.720- 19:11.900* :  This is the way I have to live now.
*19:17.600- 19:19.460* :  Without your hands, you don't even have balance.
*19:20.400- 19:21.720* :  You can't sit yourself.
*19:22.380- 19:23.440* :  You can't stand yourself.
*19:24.980- 19:25.880* :  You can't feed yourself.
*19:26.260- 19:27.660* :  You really can't do anything.
*19:30.720- 19:32.640* :  Katana says he knows who attacked him.
*19:33.500- 19:35.420* :  He thinks it was someone in his family.
*19:35.980- 19:38.220* :  But a year on, no one's been arrested.
*19:39.260- 19:41.760* :  He cut me because of witchcraft.
*19:42.940- 19:44.960* :  He said that I'd killed his child.
*19:46.580- 19:49.080* :  But I don't know anything about witchcraft.
*19:50.100- 19:50.580* :  Honestly.
*19:51.460- 19:54.620* :  Like others, Katana suspects the real reason
*19:54.620- 19:56.640* :  he was targeted was for his land.
*19:57.520- 19:59.180* :  They do have a piece of land.
*20:00.160- 20:01.600* :  It's a big piece of land
*20:02.540- 20:03.060* :  by the sea.
*20:04.880- 20:10.000* :  It's all about inheriting, acquiring land resources, properties, you know.
*20:10.580- 20:12.860* :  Julius Huanyama is a human rights worker
*20:12.860- 20:15.040* :  whose organization Haki Yetu
*20:15.700- 20:18.680* :  works with elderly people like Katana who've been attacked.
*20:19.380- 20:22.460* :  They believe on average more than one elderly person
*20:22.460- 20:24.980* :  is being murdered here every week.
*20:25.520- 20:28.780* :  It's mostly men here in Kilefi simply because
*20:29.420- 20:31.700* :  according to the locals here.
*20:32.160- 20:34.160* :  Men are the only people who are allowed to inherit
*20:35.040- 20:35.620* :  and to keep it.
*20:37.460- 20:40.460* :  They use the word witchcraft as a justification
*20:40.540- 20:43.360* :  because they will get public sympathy.
*20:43.780- 20:45.080* :  People will just assume and say,
*20:45.080- 20:47.240* :  if he was a witch, it's good that you have killed him.
*20:47.680- 20:49.660* :  It's just a tactic, a strategy they are using
*20:49.660- 20:51.380* :  to kill the elders.
*20:51.900- 20:54.540* :  Julius says poverty, lack of jobs,
*20:55.100- 20:57.620* :  and an increase in the value of land at the coast
*20:57.920- 21:00.140* :  is driving this disturbing new trend.
*21:01.560- 21:03.120* :  I spoke to a former hitman
*21:03.600- 21:07.040* :  who claimed he'd been paid to kill more than 20 people
*21:07.460- 21:10.040* :  for as little as a few hundred dollars a time.
*21:10.920- 21:14.200* :  He says it was always the family who ordered the killing.
*21:15.260- 21:16.980* :  I've done something bad, he says.
*21:18.020- 21:19.520* :  But according to the law and God,
*21:19.940- 21:22.200* :  the person who sent me is the guilty one.
*21:22.780- 21:23.500* :  I push him.
*21:24.240- 21:25.800* :  But he was the one who killed
*21:26.400- 21:28.640* :  who gave those elderly people a dead sentence.
*21:29.380- 21:30.240* :  He doesn't reply.
*21:31.100- 21:32.360* :  Very few people have been charged
*21:32.360- 21:34.660* :  on these allegations of killings of the elderly.
*21:35.140- 21:35.800* :  Very few people.
*21:36.280- 21:38.180* :  Julius blames poor policing
*21:38.180- 21:40.520* :  for the reason killers like this hitman
*21:40.520- 21:41.480* :  haven't been caught.
*21:41.820- 21:44.460* :  The police are the weakest link in the whole this process.
*21:44.760- 21:46.920* :  Some of them, they can't even tell you how many people
*21:46.920- 21:48.520* :  have been killed, they can't.
*21:49.120- 21:51.080* :  And that's why I think even the people who are involved
*21:51.080- 21:53.320* :  in killing, they feel they are so free.
*21:53.840- 21:55.800* :  We asked the Kenyan police to comment.
*21:56.520- 21:57.420* :  They didn't respond.
*21:59.700- 22:00.660* :  Like other survivors,
*22:01.240- 22:03.260* :  Katana now lives in a rescue center
*22:03.700- 22:05.040* :  where he can be cared for.
*22:05.860- 22:07.180* :  He wants to visit his home,
*22:07.980- 22:09.400* :  but he's cared to go alone.
*22:10.040- 22:11.440* :  So we go with him.
*22:13.020- 22:15.040* :  This is where he was attacked.
*22:16.440- 22:18.340* :  And it's an emotional homecoming,
*22:19.260- 22:21.460* :  particularly for his youngest son.
*22:29.580- 22:30.100* :  Look.
*22:32.140- 22:35.140* :  As we prepare to take Katana back to the rescue center,
*22:35.840- 22:37.880* :  I'm told the very fact he survived.
*22:38.820- 22:42.200* :  Means many people here believe he must be a witch.
*22:43.420- 22:46.620* :  I fear he will never be able to go home.
*22:48.700- 22:51.980* :  In Jerry Mawangi reporting for BBC Africa Eye.
*22:52.980- 22:55.500* :  For decades, scientists have been sounding the alarm
*22:55.500- 22:58.720* :  that the population of wild salmon is a grave risk,
*22:59.360- 23:02.140* :  as this year's fishing season began in Northern Europe,
*23:02.580- 23:06.420* :  some Scandinavian countries took the decision to ban salmon fishing
*23:06.420- 23:08.240* :  in several rivers and lakes.
*23:08.760- 23:11.300* :  Now, a Norwegian lawyer is suing his government,
*23:11.300- 23:15.240* :  accusing it of not doing enough to protect the vulnerable species.
*23:15.900- 23:17.360* :  Stephanie Sacrisson reports.
*23:19.800- 23:23.080* :  This is a river in Dala, the southwest of Norway.
*23:25.400- 23:27.160* :  A wild salmon has just been caught.
*23:27.500- 23:31.520* :  Its shiny silver scales glistening as it slides into a large bag,
*23:31.920- 23:33.300* :  thrashing again for that time.
*23:34.020- 23:37.720* :  Here volunteers are catching the fish to try to preserve the species
*23:38.360- 23:40.260* :  by taking them to a nearby hatchery,
*23:40.360- 23:43.220* :  a facility for the artificial hatching of eggs.
*23:46.780- 23:49.200* :  In Gisavan, who runs the hatchery,
*23:49.560- 23:51.960* :  says the salmon is immensely valuable,
*23:52.520- 23:54.380* :  nicknaming it a goldfish.
*23:55.100- 23:57.880* :  But the increasing shortage of wild salmon has been a cause
*23:57.880- 23:58.980* :  for concern for years,
*23:59.520- 24:01.920* :  and this summer it seems the alarm bells are ringing
*24:02.660- 24:03.340* :  particularly loudly.
*24:04.060- 24:06.580* :  Let's just take one Norwegian river as an example.
*24:06.900- 24:10.540* :  Biackheim's Elva, there just about 600 salmon
*24:10.620- 24:13.280* :  were recorded as of the 1st of July this year.
*24:13.740- 24:17.240* :  In 2022, that figure was 2500.
*24:18.220- 24:21.840* :  So the Environment Agency decided to temporarily stop
*24:21.840- 24:24.840* :  salmon fishing in 33 rivers and lakes,
*24:25.280- 24:28.480* :  and are due to decide this week whether that ban stays in place.
*24:29.220- 24:32.280* :  In neighbouring Sweden, a similar ban has been implemented.
*24:33.080- 24:36.760* :  But some fishermen and environmentalists have called on politicians
*24:36.800- 24:38.760* :  to do more to save the species,
*24:39.400- 24:43.700* :  and one Norwegian lawyer Sven Overballer has filed a police report
*24:44.160- 24:46.800* :  accusing the government of breaking the environment
*24:46.800- 24:49.420* :  protections in Norway's constitution.
*24:52.080- 24:54.580* :  I am reporting the state for environmental crimes,
*24:54.660- 24:59.180* :  for participation in what I believe is the extinction of wild salmon in Norway.
*24:59.940- 25:01.460* :  Because the way things are looking now,
*25:01.860- 25:03.300* :  we're heading in the wrong direction.
*25:03.780- 25:05.980* :  The government has not commented on the case,
*25:06.420- 25:09.560* :  but the Environment Minister has said that commercial fisheries
*25:09.760- 25:13.160* :  should be prepared for a potential reduction in quotas.
*25:13.880- 25:16.820* :  And the salmon shortage is happening in other countries too,
*25:16.820- 25:18.720* :  such as the UK and Canada,
*25:19.360- 25:22.260* :  the decline is explained by a number of factors.
*25:22.620- 25:24.660* :  Historical overfishing, disease,
*25:24.660- 25:28.900* :  sea lies, a shortage of food and climate change,
*25:29.240- 25:31.360* :  affecting the salmon's important habitats,
*25:32.040- 25:36.660* :  as it during its lifetime moves between the sea and its spawning rivers.
*25:37.520- 25:38.580* :  Stephanie's Acreson.
*25:39.300- 25:43.740* :  Shanks and surprises are expected at the upcoming summer and Olympics in Paris,
*25:44.180- 25:46.320* :  but in the sport of artistic swimming,
*25:46.320- 25:48.060* :  they are almost guaranteed.
*25:48.580- 25:51.060* :  A new scoring system in the absence of Russia
*25:51.060- 25:52.820* :  have long dominated the sport,
*25:53.180- 25:56.280* :  is promising a more exciting contest than ever before.
*25:56.740- 25:59.360* :  It's also the first time men have been allowed to compete
*25:59.780- 26:00.780* :  Ella Bicknell reports.
*26:04.740- 26:07.660* :  It's considered one of the world's most grueling sports.
*26:08.280- 26:10.900* :  Artistic swimming, formerly known as synchronized swimming,
*26:10.900- 26:12.880* :  demands the power of a weightlifter,
*26:12.880- 26:15.440* :  the speed and lung capacity of a distant swimmer,
*26:15.780- 26:17.720* :  and the flexibility of a gymnast.
*26:18.080- 26:21.740* :  On top of that, athletes are performing in sync in time to music,
*26:21.740- 26:24.380* :  without ever touching the bottom of the pool.
*26:24.740- 26:26.660* :  If that's not enough to compel you to watch,
*26:26.980- 26:31.120* :  the event in Paris is set to be the closest contest in Olympic history.
*26:34.220- 26:35.740* :  One reason for that is Russia.
*26:36.180- 26:38.440* :  They've long dominated the sport with a winning streak
*26:38.440- 26:41.300* :  stretching back to the 2000 games in Sydney.
*26:41.300- 26:44.600* :  They've been barred from taking part in this year's Olympics,
*26:44.600- 26:46.580* :  following the invasion of Ukraine.
*26:47.260- 26:51.360* :  However, the shake-up is also thanks to an overhaul of the scoring system,
*26:51.360- 26:54.520* :  mirroring changes in gymnastics and figure skating,
*26:54.960- 26:57.760* :  scoring is less subjective and more mathematical.
*26:58.820- 27:00.580* :  More points are up for grabs for creativity,
*27:00.580- 27:02.800* :  which promises more complex routines,
*27:02.800- 27:05.680* :  with flips, split and artistic flair.
*27:06.160- 27:10.320* :  Mayuko Fujiki is the head coach for the Spanish national synchronized swimming team.
*27:10.320- 27:14.100* :  She says the duet competition will be particularly competitive.
*27:14.780- 27:18.280* :  Like, top 10, 12 duets, everyone can win.
*27:18.680- 27:24.980* :  This rule change had made more exciting and also it's a stress also
*27:24.980- 27:28.280* :  because you can kind of assume who your rivals are
*27:28.700- 27:30.080* :  because it could be anyone.
*27:30.080- 27:33.360* :  So this involves a lot of opportunities,
*27:33.360- 27:36.440* :  but in the same time you never know, you might fall.
*27:36.440- 27:38.980* :  It's also gone down well among athletes.
*27:39.380- 27:41.600* :  Kate Shortman is part of Great Britain's team.
*27:41.940- 27:43.520* :  We really want to get on that podium.
*27:43.520- 27:48.040* :  So I think our hearts are really in at this time to go for the results
*27:48.040- 27:50.600* :  and not just the experience and see where we come.
*27:50.600- 27:52.860* :  We're really fighting for those top spaces.
*27:53.480- 27:55.600* :  However, one thing has not changed,
*27:55.960- 27:59.540* :  despite a bold move by World Aquatics to allow men to take part.
*27:59.540- 28:02.660* :  This year's competition remains 100% female.
*28:02.660- 28:06.800* :  The body says they are determined to ensure male swimmers will be represented
*28:06.800- 28:09.580* :  in the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028,
*28:10.200- 28:13.260* :  including the introduction of a mixed-uet competition.
*28:14.800- 28:17.160* :  And I'll look forward to that, Ella Bickner reporting.
*28:17.980- 28:20.060* :  Now for a rather bizarre story.
*28:20.340- 28:23.780* :  Two years ago when the current Russian invasion of Ukraine started,
*28:24.200- 28:27.680* :  a mechanic from Uzbekistan, Umid Azabayev,
*28:27.800- 28:29.960* :  found himself in a precarious position.
*28:30.520- 28:33.180* :  He bears an uncanny resemblance to Ukraine's
*28:33.180- 28:34.800* :  President Valodomir Zelensky,
*28:35.240- 28:36.720* :  and he was wanted by Russians,
*28:36.720- 28:39.400* :  seeking to use him for propaganda purposes.
*28:40.040- 28:43.540* :  He escaped with the help of impersonators of Valodomir Putin
*28:44.000- 28:46.660* :  and the North Korean leader Kim Jun-un,
*28:47.020- 28:48.280* :  and ended up in Germany.
*28:48.820- 28:52.260* :  But now he fears being kidnapped by agents from Moscow
*28:52.720- 28:55.300* :  if he is deported back to Uzbekistan.
*28:55.860- 28:59.760* :  Rob Young spoke to the Kim Jun-un impersonator Howard X
*29:00.140- 29:03.360* :  and asked him for some background to Mr. Azabayev's story.
*29:04.320- 29:06.560* :  In 2019 he was on the subway
*29:07.160- 29:09.480* :  when someone took a photo of him just sitting there
*29:10.140- 29:12.420* :  and overnight he became really famous
*29:13.040- 29:14.700* :  all across Russia and Ukraine.
*29:15.660- 29:19.860* :  And then he was being hired for Zelensky geeks in personating
*29:19.860- 29:24.760* :  and he was for a while being used for Russian propaganda in 2019.
*29:25.320- 29:27.000* :  But after realizing what he was doing,
*29:27.000- 29:28.940* :  he quit and went back to Uzbekistan.
*29:29.740- 29:31.160* :  And then he went to Ukraine
*29:31.680- 29:33.920* :  because people from Zelensky's team
*29:33.920- 29:36.320* :  made sure to keep him out of our Russian propaganda.
*29:37.180- 29:39.120* :  And yeah, this is how he became famous.
*29:39.940- 29:42.580* :  And he's in Germany after you were involved
*29:42.580- 29:44.480* :  in helping to rescue him.
*29:44.480- 29:45.460* :  Just tell us a bit about that.
*29:46.600- 29:48.360* :  When the Ukraine war started in 2022,
*29:49.320- 29:50.620* :  I knew of his existence.
*29:50.620- 29:51.780* :  I knew he was in danger.
*29:52.060- 29:54.600* :  I gave him a call and he said he wanted to get out.
*29:54.740- 29:56.620* :  Bombs were happening all around him.
*29:57.220- 30:00.280* :  So I ran out my friend who's the Putin personator in Poland
*30:00.920- 30:02.940* :  and we actually got him out.
*30:03.200- 30:04.260* :  We sent some people over
*30:04.760- 30:07.500* :  and they drove all the way from Poland into Kiev
*30:07.960- 30:09.640* :  and we extracted him into Poland.
*30:10.120- 30:11.840* :  And then from Poland he went to Germany.
*30:12.440- 30:15.100* :  I've got a lawyer and we applied for asylum
*30:15.760- 30:17.760* :  and he was putting a refugee camp.
*30:18.380- 30:19.900* :  However, when he was in the refugee camp,
*30:19.900- 30:22.060* :  he was being threatened by Russians in the camp
*30:22.580- 30:24.720* :  and we got him out of that situation
*30:25.180- 30:26.580* :  into a private accommodation.
*30:27.160- 30:31.200* :  However, his appeal for refugee status has been rejected
*30:31.200- 30:33.560* :  and he could be deported at any time.
*30:33.840- 30:36.480* :  We tell us why he doesn't want to go back to his backistan.
*30:37.220- 30:40.060* :  His parents has been harassed on numerous occasions
*30:40.980- 30:42.580* :  to reveal his whereabouts.
*30:43.220- 30:44.780* :  All's backistan is a Russian ally.
*30:45.400- 30:47.320* :  So we know that if he goes back,
*30:47.320- 30:49.480* :  he will be kidnapped to Moscow
*30:49.780- 30:52.120* :  and be forced to make it Russian propaganda.
*30:52.820- 30:55.020* :  What about Ukraine's involvement in this?
*30:55.020- 30:57.000* :  Has his president Zelensky been involved at all?
*30:58.220- 31:00.280* :  Well, we were Zelensky's production team
*31:00.280- 31:01.620* :  from a servant of the people
*31:02.320- 31:05.840* :  and from that comedy show flew him into Ukraine before the war
*31:06.180- 31:08.000* :  so that he could be our reach of the Russians.
*31:08.660- 31:10.000* :  However, when the war started,
*31:10.540- 31:11.880* :  they didn't have anything to do with it.
*31:11.880- 31:14.980* :  I asked Ormit why don't you call President Zelensky
*31:14.980- 31:17.180* :  and his people would get you out
*31:17.220- 31:19.460* :  and he said he knows the president has his hands full
*31:20.060- 31:22.880* :  and he felt he wasn't worthy enough of his attention.
*31:23.480- 31:25.820* :  And I know President Zelensky was pretty busy
*31:25.820- 31:28.260* :  during that time with other more important stuff
*31:28.260- 31:29.560* :  so I decided to do something
*31:30.080- 31:32.600* :  and so did the Putin person at our Steve Poland.
*31:33.460- 31:37.520* :  The Kim Jong Un impersonator Howard X talking to Rob Young.
*31:40.820- 31:42.360* :  And that's all from us for now
*31:42.420- 31:43.820* :  but there will be a new edition
*31:43.820- 31:45.860* :  of the Global News Podcast later.
*31:46.380- 31:48.280* :  If you want to comment on this podcast
*31:48.440- 31:49.820* :  or the topics covered in it,
*31:49.820- 31:50.980* :  you can send us an email.
*31:50.980- 31:55.160* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*31:55.180- 31:59.380* :  You can also find us on X at Global News Pod.
*31:59.840- 32:02.000* :  This edition was mixed by James Piper.
*32:02.000- 32:03.880* :  The producer was Oliver Burlow.
*32:04.240- 32:05.720* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*32:06.020- 32:06.880* :  I'm Rachel Wright.
*32:06.940- 32:08.680* :  Until next time, goodbye.
*32:17.080- 32:19.540* :  This is the story of how a group of people
*32:19.820- 32:21.880* :  brought music back to Afghanistan
*32:21.940- 32:26.380* :  by creating their own version of American Idol.
*32:27.600- 32:29.180* :  The joy they brought to the nation.
*32:29.680- 32:30.880* :  You're free completely.
*32:31.320- 32:32.900* :  No one is there to destroy you.
*32:33.220- 32:34.860* :  The danger they endured.
*32:35.300- 32:37.520* :  This fit my head should be cut off.
*32:38.320- 32:39.140* :  I'm John Legend.
*32:39.760- 32:43.160* :  Listen to Afghan Star on the iHeartRadio app
*32:43.360- 32:45.000* :  or wherever you get your podcast.
