*01:21.520- 01:24.760* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Saturday, the 6th of July,
*01:24.760- 01:25.940* :  these are our main stories.
*01:26.500- 01:28.800* :  Britain's new Prime Minister, Keir Starmer,
*01:28.820- 01:31.000* :  has appointed his senior government team
*01:31.000- 01:35.780* :  after the centre-left Labour Party swept a power in Thursday's general election.
*01:36.480- 01:40.420* :  Joe Biden has told a campaign event that he's fit and ready to stay
*01:40.420- 01:44.340* :  in the presidential race days after his lackluster performance

*01:47.800- 01:51.340* :  Hungary's Prime Minister Victor Orburn has held talks with Vladimir Putin
*01:51.340- 01:55.940* :  in Moscow on a visit that's drawn sharp criticism from other European leaders.
*01:58.500- 01:59.340* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:59.340- 02:03.480* :  after the recent violence surrounding the youth-led protests in Kenya...
*02:03.580- 02:05.180* :  I took a long time before coming to X.
*02:05.240- 02:07.420* :  I think I should be more often in this space
*02:07.700- 02:12.260* :  to engage with you guys and to deal with the situation there.
*02:12.780- 02:15.600* :  The president goes on social media. Will it help?
*02:18.920- 02:20.160* :  We begin in the UK.
*02:20.600- 02:23.340* :  Hours after his Labour Party was swept to office
*02:23.340- 02:25.140* :  with a massive electoral majority,
*02:25.700- 02:27.620* :  Britain's new Prime Minister, Keir Starmer,
*02:27.620- 02:29.720* :  has assembled his senior government team.
*02:30.160- 02:33.040* :  His aim, he told supporters, was to rebuild Britain
*02:33.040- 02:34.760* :  and restore trust in politics,
*02:35.240- 02:37.020* :  although he warned this would take time.
*02:37.260- 02:39.260* :  Whether you voted Labour or not,
*02:39.800- 02:42.780* :  in fact, especially if you did not,
*02:43.420- 02:45.100* :  I say to you directly,
*02:46.120- 02:48.500* :  my government will serve you.
*02:49.160- 02:51.820* :  Politics can be a force for good.
*02:52.240- 02:53.020* :  We will show that.
*02:53.660- 02:57.340* :  We've changed the Labour Party, returned it to service.
*02:58.080- 02:59.600* :  And that is how we will govern.
*03:00.300- 03:02.400* :  Country first, party second.
*03:03.140- 03:06.080* :  Labour has a majority of more than 170,
*03:06.080- 03:10.240* :  ending 14 years of often turbulent, conservative government.
*03:11.000- 03:12.780* :  Keir Starmer began on Friday afternoon,
*03:12.780- 03:14.640* :  taking up the reins of government
*03:14.640- 03:17.000* :  by welcoming colleagues to Downing Street
*03:17.000- 03:18.380* :  and appointing his cabinet.
*03:18.940- 03:22.800* :  Their task is to convert the promises of the campaign into action.
*03:23.220- 03:25.820* :  Our chief political correspondent, Henry Zerthman,
*03:25.820- 03:28.560* :  looks at the future direction of this new government.
*03:29.300- 03:31.960* :  Our work is urgent, and we begin it today.
*03:32.480- 03:35.020* :  Those were the last words of Sir Keir Starmer's first speech
*03:35.020- 03:35.840* :  as Prime Minister.
*03:36.420- 03:38.560* :  First off, Sir Keir, like every Prime Minister,
*03:38.580- 03:41.240* :  would have been asked to write his letters of last resort,
*03:41.840- 03:43.660* :  handwritten instructions for the commanders
*03:43.660- 03:45.220* :  of Britain's nuclear submarines.
*03:46.260- 03:48.360* :  Then, a little more presently,
*03:48.780- 03:49.980* :  appointing his first cabinet,
*03:50.400- 03:52.200* :  inviting the key figures to Downing Street.
*03:54.860- 03:57.700* :  Here, the Prime Minister was in no drama, Starmer mode.
*03:58.300- 04:01.040* :  The last Labour Prime Minister to win from opposition, Tony Blair,
*04:01.680- 04:03.100* :  shuffled his lieutenant's around.
*04:03.760- 04:04.900* :  Not so, for Sir Keir.
*04:05.240- 04:07.440* :  Almost every senior member of his shadow cabinet
*04:07.440- 04:10.920* :  will sit around the real cabinet table in the same portfolio.
*04:11.580- 04:14.380* :  Angela Rainer is deputy Prime Minister and levelling up secretary.
*04:14.380- 04:17.520* :  Rachel Reeves, Britain's first female chancellor.
*04:18.160- 04:20.720* :  Pat McFadden, Labour's campaign supremo,
*04:20.960- 04:22.860* :  will run the crucial cabinet office.
*04:23.420- 04:24.880* :  David Lamy is now foreign secretary.
*04:24.880- 04:26.940* :  Ifet Cooper is the home secretary.
*04:27.360- 04:28.920* :  But it's not just those departments
*04:28.920- 04:31.040* :  that will be the engine of Sir Keir's success,
*04:31.600- 04:33.580* :  or otherwise, as Prime Minister.
*04:33.960- 04:35.880* :  He made that much clear in his speech.
*04:36.180- 04:37.300* :  Brick, my brick,
*04:38.200- 04:41.640* :  we will rebuild the infrastructure of opportunity,
*04:42.520- 04:44.560* :  the world-class schools and colleges,
*04:45.420- 04:47.160* :  the affordable homes that I know
*04:47.860- 04:50.840* :  are the ingredients of hope for working people.
*04:51.560- 04:53.580* :  That key election pledge on schools,
*04:53.580- 04:55.480* :  6,500 new teachers,
*04:55.980- 04:58.060* :  is the responsibility of Bridget Phillipson,
*04:58.060- 05:00.460* :  a proudly working class woman from Sunderland,
*05:00.940- 05:02.720* :  and now our education secretary.
*05:03.160- 05:05.760* :  She will also quickly, in conjunction with Ms Reeves,
*05:06.120- 05:08.660* :  levy VAT on private school fees.
*05:09.200- 05:11.280* :  Affordable homes, well that's Ms Rainer's brief,
*05:11.280- 05:14.920* :  expect Labour to set the ball rolling on planning reforms within days.
*05:15.800- 05:18.260* :  Other early priorities will include GB energy,
*05:18.620- 05:19.960* :  a publicly owned energy company,
*05:19.960- 05:22.260* :  that will be brought into the world by Ed Miliband,
*05:22.260- 05:23.860* :  who's returning as energy secretary,
*05:24.200- 05:25.700* :  off for a 14-year break.
*05:26.340- 05:27.520* :  And cutting NHS waiting lists,
*05:27.540- 05:29.980* :  well that's a task for West Streeting as health secretary.
*05:30.640- 05:33.000* :  That cabinet will meet for the first time tomorrow.
*05:33.580- 05:34.920* :  Many will feel they need a rest
*05:34.920- 05:36.960* :  after an exhausting election campaign.
*05:37.500- 05:39.860* :  But Parliament is likely to sit a few weeks longer than usual
*05:39.860- 05:41.060* :  before it's summer break.
*05:41.480- 05:42.220* :  Henry Zephtman.
*05:42.840- 05:45.560* :  So let's look more now at what went wrong
*05:45.560- 05:47.360* :  with the former British Prime Minister,
*05:47.360- 05:49.960* :  Rishi Sunak, and the Conservative Party in this election.
*05:50.620- 05:55.100* :  David Gork was a Conservative MP between 2005 and 2019.
*05:55.100- 05:57.120* :  He's a former cabinet minister
*05:57.140- 05:59.760* :  who fell out with his party over Brexit.
*06:00.100- 06:03.360* :  He refused to accept the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union
*06:03.920- 06:05.360* :  without a proper trade deal.
*06:05.820- 06:09.000* :  Andrew Peach asked him for his thoughts on the polls.
*06:09.520- 06:12.540* :  I think this does go back to that period of time
*06:12.860- 06:15.140* :  where the party made a decision
*06:15.240- 06:17.360* :  that it was prepared to be a populist party.
*06:17.360- 06:18.720* :  It was going to move to the right.
*06:19.260- 06:21.580* :  It was going to make big bold promises
*06:21.720- 06:23.580* :  that were going to be very hard to deliver.
*06:24.300- 06:27.000* :  And it focused much more on that
*06:27.240- 06:30.100* :  than delivering sensible, competent government.
*06:30.800- 06:32.840* :  And I think it's paying the price for that.
*06:33.580- 06:36.000* :  And what's happened is they've ended up
*06:36.520- 06:38.260* :  essentially disappointing everybody.
*06:39.120- 06:42.020* :  People who made big promises to fill that down,
*06:42.700- 06:45.120* :  others feel that the party has moved away from them.
*06:45.220- 06:47.160* :  And the combination of all of that
*06:47.840- 06:52.080* :  has resulted in disastrous defeat in this general election.
*06:52.140- 06:54.200* :  But in other countries in Europe in particular,
*06:54.640- 06:56.520* :  the process you've just described
*06:56.520- 07:00.400* :  has worked well and is delivering support for political parties.
*07:00.400- 07:01.820* :  So why was Britain different?
*07:02.940- 07:05.280* :  Well, it works well when you're not in government.
*07:05.300- 07:09.120* :  This is the thing that the thing about populist parties
*07:09.120- 07:13.960* :  is that they can do very well when they're not in office,
*07:14.780- 07:18.580* :  at least appealing to a section of the electorate.
*07:19.080- 07:23.780* :  But when you are in power, it becomes very hard to deliver.
*07:24.080- 07:26.740* :  So the promises that are effective in winning votes
*07:27.440- 07:29.940* :  are also held against you when in office.
*07:31.140- 07:34.740* :  After 14 years in power in a functioning democracy,
*07:35.400- 07:38.880* :  can any political party make the case to be re-elected?
*07:38.920- 07:40.840* :  Because there's always going to be this list of things
*07:40.840- 07:43.500* :  that have gone wrong during their period in office,
*07:43.500- 07:45.200* :  therefore, not therefore, we could debate
*07:45.840- 07:47.000* :  any particular thing on the list.
*07:47.060- 07:48.280* :  But that's always going to be a problem.
*07:48.280- 07:50.320* :  In fact, many countries don't even allow governments
*07:50.320- 07:52.360* :  to be in power for that long for that reason.
*07:53.320- 07:55.000* :  I think you make a very fair point.
*07:55.000- 07:58.860* :  It does become harder, I think, as time goes on,
*07:59.260- 08:00.220* :  to be a re-elected.
*08:00.500- 08:06.620* :  And nobody has won more often than the conservatives had done.
*08:07.040- 08:11.740* :  And to go and win what would be a fifth general election
*08:12.180- 08:14.340* :  is unprecedented in modern times.
*08:14.680- 08:17.420* :  And yes, anything that happens, particularly negatively,
*08:18.500- 08:20.480* :  will be held against incumbent government.
*08:20.480- 08:22.960* :  There's no way you can blame your predecessors.
*08:24.020- 08:26.420* :  You are held responsible for everything that happens.
*08:26.580- 08:30.160* :  So along with that, there are some genuine failures
*08:30.160- 08:31.980* :  I think within the conservative party.
*08:31.980- 08:35.260* :  It also has to be acknowledged that if you're in office
*08:35.260- 08:37.540* :  for a long time, it becomes harder and harder
*08:37.540- 08:38.560* :  to become re-elected.
*08:38.840- 08:40.020* :  They've also had to operate.
*08:40.520- 08:43.680* :  It has to be acknowledged in difficult international
*08:44.700- 08:48.100* :  circumstances with COVID, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*08:49.000- 08:52.080* :  Every developed country has faced issues
*08:52.080- 08:56.240* :  with higher inflation and therefore a squeeze on living
*08:56.240- 08:56.880* :  standards.
*08:57.420- 09:00.200* :  These all have come into play as well.
*09:00.200- 09:02.520* :  There's been some bad luck, if you like.
*09:03.100- 09:05.020* :  But I also think that the conservative party
*09:05.020- 09:08.220* :  has to look at what it's done and the approach it's taken.
*09:08.300- 09:11.620* :  It's policies, it's tone, and it's all
*09:11.620- 09:13.400* :  round level of confidence and acknowledge
*09:13.700- 09:16.140* :  that it has made some substantial mistakes itself.
*09:16.300- 09:18.260* :  Former Conservative MP, David Gork.
*09:18.840- 09:22.240* :  In Scotland, where the Scottish National Party or SNP
*09:22.240- 09:24.940* :  have run the devolved government for 17 years,
*09:25.560- 09:28.640* :  Labour increased their parliamentary seats from just one
*09:28.720- 09:29.900* :  to 37.
*09:30.520- 09:35.180* :  Labour also did well in Wales, where applied Kumru, one for seats.
*09:35.260- 09:40.180* :  Shinfane have succeeded the Democratic Unionist Party or DUP
*09:40.740- 09:44.060* :  as the largest party in Northern Ireland with seven MPs,
*09:44.060- 09:47.400* :  but they choose not to attend Parliament in London.
*09:48.220- 09:50.940* :  For further details, check out the UK election pages
*09:51.140- 09:52.220* :  on the BBC website.
*09:53.460- 09:55.440* :  Let's turn to international reaction now.
*09:55.520- 09:57.460* :  And President Biden has congratulated
*09:57.460- 09:59.600* :  Keir Starmer on Labour's election victory.
*09:59.800- 10:02.880* :  The White House said the two leaders spoke about their joint support
*10:02.880- 10:06.420* :  for Ukraine in its war against Russia and their shared commitment
*10:06.420- 10:08.720* :  to protecting peace in Northern Ireland.
*10:09.380- 10:12.040* :  Our US State Department correspondent is Tom Bateman.
*10:12.420- 10:16.460* :  It was revealed on Air Force One in a press gaggle there that he had
*10:16.940- 10:19.420* :  made that phone call to Keir Starmer to congratulate him
*10:19.420- 10:22.280* :  on being appointed Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
*10:22.660- 10:24.780* :  And in the short statement, the read out that they call it
*10:24.780- 10:27.560* :  from the White House, we've got a bit of detail about what they discussed.
*10:27.560- 10:31.440* :  Some of the things you would absolutely expect to be in this kind of statement,
*10:31.440- 10:34.900* :  the US talking about reaffirming the special relationship
*10:35.520- 10:37.040* :  between the US and the UK.
*10:37.040- 10:40.280* :  That phrase, always there because they know it stimulates the importance
*10:40.760- 10:45.240* :  in the UK for diplomatic reasons to feel a closeness to the United States.
*10:45.780- 10:52.380* :  But on matters of substance, the major mentions there were around Ukraine,
*10:52.380- 10:54.940* :  support for Ukraine, continuing that relationship,
*10:54.940- 10:56.980* :  and also protecting the good Friday agreement.
*10:57.160- 10:59.960* :  Because, of course, remember, the end of the troubles
*10:59.960- 11:03.220* :  that civil conflict in the late 90s in Northern Ireland
*11:03.260- 11:07.080* :  was part broken by the US Senator George Mitchell back then.
*11:07.080- 11:09.580* :  It's a subject very close to President Biden's heart
*11:09.580- 11:11.300* :  because of his Irish heritage.
*11:11.420- 11:13.080* :  And there was a significant mention of that.
*11:13.380- 11:17.040* :  And also, I think, about protecting the facts that devolved government
*11:17.040- 11:18.920* :  was restored in Northern Ireland this year.
*11:18.920- 11:20.840* :  I think it's really important to the White House
*11:21.340- 11:22.740* :  that there is mention of that.
*11:22.740- 11:26.060* :  And there was focus on that in this new Kierstammer administration.
*11:26.380- 11:27.600* :  The key moment will come next week.
*11:27.600- 11:30.640* :  Mr. Stammer heads over here to Washington for the NATO summit.
*11:30.920- 11:34.360* :  What the Americans will be looking for from him is an absolute commitment
*11:34.820- 11:36.920* :  to keep up arms supply to Ukraine
*11:37.500- 11:41.520* :  and to keep the UK's military spending at a level the US wants.
*11:41.560- 11:44.920* :  And I'm not clear at the moment they're going to get an absolute guarantee about that.
*11:45.460- 11:49.080* :  Well, the head of NATO Jens Stoltenberg said he was confident
*11:49.080- 11:52.340* :  that the new government would continue Britain's support for the alliance.
*11:52.820- 11:56.980* :  I will congratulate Kierstammer on his election victory.
*11:57.140- 12:01.200* :  I look forward to welcoming him and to meet him at the NATO summit
*12:01.200- 12:03.000* :  in Washington next week.
*12:03.820- 12:06.720* :  I have met also Kierstammer here at the NATO headquarters.
*12:07.000- 12:10.140* :  And I know that he's a strong supporter of NATO,
*12:10.760- 12:12.000* :  of the transatlantic alliance,
*12:12.000- 12:17.860* :  and also committed to ensure that United Kingdom continues to be strong
*12:17.860- 12:20.080* :  and a very committed NATO ally.
*12:20.740- 12:23.100* :  Ukraine's president, Vladimir Zelensky,
*12:23.100- 12:27.360* :  said his country and Britain would continue to defend their common values.
*12:27.900- 12:30.940* :  In Russia, the Kremlin spokesman said Moscow was not optimistic
*12:30.940- 12:33.960* :  about relations with lines and improving under Labour.
*12:34.500- 12:37.580* :  The new British Foreign Minister David Lamy had this to say.
*12:37.840- 12:41.540* :  We will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine.
*12:41.780- 12:46.860* :  And of course, we've got more conflicts on the globe since the Second World War
*12:47.620- 12:49.580* :  and a real crisis in the Middle East.
*12:50.000- 12:53.960* :  But what I am looking forward to is resetting the tone
*12:53.960- 12:57.220* :  and our relationship with the European Union and our European friends.
*12:58.000- 13:01.960* :  I'm also looking forward to the United Kingdom stepping up to the top table
*13:02.380- 13:04.300* :  on the climate issue once more.
*13:04.960- 13:06.600* :  So against all this background,
*13:06.600- 13:10.400* :  I heard more about the new Labour government's imminent challenges
*13:10.400- 13:14.100* :  on a global stage from our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams.
*13:14.620- 13:19.300* :  There are two that are absolutely right in front of Kier Starmer's nose,
*13:19.300- 13:21.060* :  Ukraine and Gaza.
*13:21.640- 13:24.000* :  On Ukraine, the British government has,
*13:24.920- 13:29.320* :  for the last couple of years, been a big cheerleader for supporting Ukraine,
*13:29.320- 13:31.240* :  for getting arms to Ukraine,
*13:31.940- 13:35.220* :  trying to persuade the Americans to release the additional funds.
*13:35.920- 13:38.960* :  And so I think Ukraine expects that to continue
*13:38.960- 13:42.140* :  and there's nothing to suggest that this will change.
*13:42.780- 13:46.540* :  The Labour Party seems to share their predecessors' view
*13:46.540- 13:52.060* :  that it is absolutely essential that Vladimir Putin is not allowed to win the war in Ukraine.
*13:52.100- 13:55.240* :  Of course, there is a potential difficulty there.
*13:55.620- 14:00.100* :  And within the next few days, Kier Starmer will be going off to a NATO summit in Washington.
*14:00.660- 14:02.200* :  He'll meet Joe Biden there.
*14:02.200- 14:05.240* :  He'll obviously have a chance to look at Joe Biden
*14:05.240- 14:08.880* :  and assess what kind of state he is in mentally and physically.
*14:08.880- 14:14.900* :  And perhaps think forward a few months to whoever's going to be in the White House.
*14:14.960- 14:17.780* :  And if that person is Donald Trump,
*14:18.380- 14:21.540* :  then that whole business of being a cheerleader for Ukraine
*14:21.540- 14:24.660* :  could be that much more difficult than it already is.
*14:25.200- 14:28.600* :  And we heard there, David Lamy, the incoming foreign secretary,
*14:28.600- 14:32.600* :  say that he wants to reset relations with the European Union.
*14:32.600- 14:34.840* :  What does he mean by that? And how's he going to do it?
*14:35.280- 14:37.340* :  It's a little unclear what exactly he means.
*14:37.340- 14:42.140* :  But the Labour Party has talked about a new EU-UK security pact.
*14:42.680- 14:46.720* :  Has talked about exploring ways short of going back into the EU,
*14:46.720- 14:48.100* :  which they've absolutely ruled out,
*14:48.720- 14:52.760* :  but ways to improve and deepen the relationship with European partners.
*14:53.260- 14:56.140* :  But again, the potentially there are difficulties there,
*14:56.140- 14:58.940* :  because on Sunday, in France,
*14:59.060- 15:02.860* :  we may have a complete shift of government in that country
*15:03.480- 15:07.080* :  if the right takes over from Marine Le Pen's party takes over,
*15:07.580- 15:10.740* :  then all sorts of things that the Labour Party might want to do
*15:10.740- 15:13.140* :  with our European partners, particularly with France,
*15:13.420- 15:14.460* :  could be that much more difficult.
*15:14.460- 15:17.180* :  Think about cooperation on migration, for example.
*15:17.700- 15:19.980* :  And for Britain to have any influence on the international stage,
*15:19.980- 15:22.060* :  it needs alliances and relationships.
*15:22.500- 15:24.660* :  You talk about influence on the international stage
*15:24.660- 15:27.440* :  the last time the Labour government got it in 1997.
*15:28.240- 15:33.320* :  They were significantly more potent force on the international stage, weren't they?
*15:33.820- 15:35.780* :  They were, and arguably Britain was,
*15:35.960- 15:41.140* :  and some people would say that it's a slow steady decline
*15:41.140- 15:45.340* :  from post-imperial Britain to where we are today.
*15:45.920- 15:47.660* :  Britain is not a major player,
*15:48.120- 15:50.540* :  and that is why these relationships are so important.
*15:50.840- 15:52.500* :  And of course, there are umpteen other challenges,
*15:52.500- 15:54.920* :  arguably climate change being the biggest,
*15:54.920- 15:56.480* :  the relationship with China,
*15:56.900- 15:59.580* :  and that relationship is a very, very difficult one.
*16:00.100- 16:02.680* :  Foreign policy didn't come up in the election campaign,
*16:02.680- 16:04.680* :  and Gaza didn't come up in the election campaign,
*16:05.260- 16:07.660* :  but it did cost Labour four seats,
*16:08.600- 16:10.220* :  four candidates who ran as independence,
*16:10.920- 16:13.300* :  largely because of their unhappiness
*16:13.820- 16:17.060* :  with what they saw as the Labour Party's unwillingness
*16:17.480- 16:19.460* :  to endorse a call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
*16:19.460- 16:21.540* :  Now, the Labour Party did adjust subsequently,
*16:21.980- 16:22.880* :  but it paid a price,
*16:23.420- 16:25.700* :  and Gaza is one of those subjects
*16:25.700- 16:27.760* :  and the wider Middle East peace process,
*16:28.040- 16:30.540* :  which will again need to be grappled with, and potentially soon.
*16:30.760- 16:31.180* :  Paul Adams.
*16:31.840- 16:35.080* :  As we heard, President Biden was traveling on Air Force One
*16:35.080- 16:35.620* :  on Friday.
*16:35.620- 16:39.040* :  He went to a campaign rally in the state of Wisconsin.
*16:39.740- 16:42.260* :  There, the 81-year-old president told supporters
*16:42.260- 16:44.920* :  that he isn't too old for a second term in office.
*16:45.420- 16:48.220* :  He also referred to his widely criticized performance
*16:48.220- 16:51.220* :  in last week's TV debate against Donald Trump.
*16:51.220- 16:51.840* :  CHEERING
*16:53.720- 16:57.780* :  Now, you've probably heard you had a little debate last week.
*16:58.960- 17:00.300* :  Can't say it's my best performance.
*17:02.420- 17:04.320* :  Whatever it stands to end, there's been a lot of speculation.
*17:05.520- 17:06.400* :  What's Joe going to do?
*17:07.660- 17:08.720* :  Is he going to stay in the race?
*17:08.720- 17:09.300* :  Yes.
*17:10.560- 17:12.180* :  Is he going to drop out? What's he going to do?
*17:13.400- 17:14.240* :  Well, here's my answer.
*17:14.540- 17:16.520* :  I am running and going to win again.
*17:16.680- 17:17.140* :  CHEERING
*17:18.880- 17:22.300* :  While our correspondent Mike Wendling was at the rally in Wisconsin,
*17:22.300- 17:25.380* :  he says President Biden was in a confident mood.
*17:25.700- 17:27.740* :  It seems like there's almost two Joe Biden's.
*17:27.740- 17:28.960* :  There's the rally Joe Biden,
*17:28.960- 17:30.620* :  and then there's the debate Joe Biden.
*17:31.200- 17:33.140* :  And today, we saw the rally Joe Biden.
*17:33.140- 17:35.140* :  He was in front of a crowd of supporters.
*17:36.120- 17:38.140* :  They were very enthusiastic. They were lapping it up.
*17:38.880- 17:40.140* :  He was on good form, book for nearly 20 minutes.
*17:40.140- 17:43.160* :  And, you know, the die-hard Democrats in the audience
*17:43.160- 17:44.220* :  really gave him a round of applause,
*17:44.800- 17:48.120* :  particularly when he went after Donald Trump,
*17:48.120- 17:50.140* :  a theme that he has returned to again and again.
*17:50.940- 17:52.960* :  He says that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy.
*17:53.920- 17:54.660* :  Mike Wendling.
*17:55.700- 17:58.700* :  Counting is underway in Iran after the second round
*17:58.700- 18:00.600* :  of voting in the presidential election.
*18:01.100- 18:03.400* :  The final results will be announced on Saturday,
*18:03.440- 18:06.800* :  and there seems to have been a surge in the turnout on Friday
*18:07.280- 18:10.120* :  after millions boycotted the polls in the first round
*18:10.120- 18:12.340* :  a week ago amid widespread discontent.
*18:12.880- 18:15.580* :  This time, state television showed voters queuing
*18:15.580- 18:18.480* :  in several cities, although conflicting reports
*18:18.480- 18:21.500* :  said the polling stations remain relatively empty.
*18:22.180- 18:24.120* :  I spoke to Kassar Nagy of BBC Persian
*18:24.120- 18:25.900* :  just before recording this podcast.
*18:26.380- 18:28.960* :  He told me about some early indications of a result.
*18:29.620- 18:32.140* :  A news agency close to the Revolutionary Guard
*18:32.140- 18:37.120* :  Tasnim news agency has just reported that early accounts
*18:37.120- 18:43.060* :  of the votes show that the relatively moderate candidate
*18:43.560- 18:47.480* :  Masoud Pazishkyan is ahead in the accounts.
*18:48.040- 18:51.820* :  So that's the latest, and it's on official.
*18:51.820- 18:54.240* :  We haven't heard from the officials yet.
*18:54.780- 18:56.620* :  It's the second round of the elections.
*18:56.620- 18:59.460* :  And as you said, there were, there are indications
*18:59.660- 19:03.960* :  that in the second round, more people turned out to vote,
*19:04.600- 19:07.120* :  out of fear, that if they don't vote,
*19:07.680- 19:12.040* :  the conservative candidates say Jalili will be elected
*19:12.040- 19:16.820* :  and he's from the most hard-line conservative
*19:17.780- 19:19.780* :  faction in the Islamic Republic.
*19:20.180- 19:24.340* :  Would the government like and require a high turnout anyway,
*19:24.340- 19:27.900* :  because otherwise it looks as though the election is illegitimate?
*19:28.160- 19:28.640* :  Absolutely.
*19:28.640- 19:34.100* :  In the first round, the turnout was just below 40%,
*19:34.420- 19:39.820* :  which was the lowest since the Islamic Revolution in 1979,
*19:39.820- 19:46.120* :  and for a regime that claims to be based on popular masses
*19:47.080- 19:51.600* :  that led a revolution, less than 40% turnout,
*19:52.020- 19:53.120* :  doesn't look too good.
*19:53.500- 19:56.140* :  Of course, they want a higher turnout.
*19:56.140- 19:59.740* :  But as you said, many people boycotted the elections.
*19:59.740- 20:02.000* :  They didn't want to have anything to do with it,
*20:02.420- 20:06.620* :  because they basically think it's not possible within the system
*20:07.200- 20:11.660* :  for any president to have any meaningful impact
*20:11.660- 20:14.360* :  in the direction their country is going to take.
*20:14.560- 20:17.520* :  And if it does turn out that this moderate candidate has won,
*20:17.520- 20:20.500* :  what difference would it make for Iranians?
*20:20.920- 20:21.980* :  Well, this is it.
*20:22.060- 20:25.460* :  The choice is between a little bit of change
*20:26.200- 20:30.660* :  compared to Iran going back to dark ages.
*20:31.360- 20:32.900* :  Going back to the dark ages is in what sense?
*20:33.740- 20:38.940* :  As I say, Mr Jalili is from the most hard-line factions
*20:39.620- 20:41.040* :  within the Islamic Republic.
*20:41.080- 20:43.320* :  And these people, if they do come to power,
*20:43.860- 20:46.820* :  many people, in fact, fear that there will be
*20:46.820- 20:49.540* :  a lot more confrontation with the outside world.
*20:49.940- 20:53.300* :  And internally, Iran is going to be more isolated
*20:53.720- 20:55.700* :  and under a lot more sanctions.
*20:56.540- 20:58.440* :  Kazranaji of BBC Persian.
*21:00.740- 21:04.040* :  Still to come, the Vatican announces the excommunication
*21:04.260- 21:07.720* :  of an archbishop after finding him guilty of schism
*21:08.200- 21:09.700* :  or splitting the church.
*21:16.860- 21:17.580* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*21:17.580- 21:21.520* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*21:21.680- 21:24.200* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*21:24.520- 21:27.300* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices
*21:27.300- 21:30.540* :  due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices
*21:30.540- 21:31.900* :  due to not hating you.
*21:32.240- 21:34.300* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited
*21:34.300- 21:37.200* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*21:37.620- 21:40.160* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com-switch.
*21:40.420- 21:42.220* :  $45 upfront for three months plus taxes and fees

*21:44.920- 21:46.440* :  slows, full turns at MintMobile.com.
*21:46.820- 21:49.340* :  John Grisham welcomes you back to Camino Island
*21:49.340- 21:53.120* :  in his number one New York Times bestseller, Camino Ghosts.
*21:53.500- 21:56.620* :  This time, a 300-year-old curse is stirring up
*21:56.620- 21:58.760* :  more trouble and paradise than ever before.
*21:59.620- 22:01.460* :  Whether you're traveling with friends or family
*22:01.820- 22:03.220* :  or staying close to home this summer,
*22:03.500- 22:06.380* :  everyone can get on the same page with this intriguing novel
*22:06.600- 22:08.480* :  that delivers sun, sand, and mystery.
*22:09.320- 22:10.920* :  Camino Ghosts is in stores now,
*22:11.400- 22:14.200* :  also available as an audiobook read by Woopy Goldberg.
*22:19.060- 22:21.620* :  Just a few days into his six-month term
*22:21.900- 22:24.320* :  at the helm of the Council of the European Union,
*22:24.320- 22:27.380* :  the Prime Minister of Hungary, Victor Orban,
*22:27.380- 22:30.160* :  is already making waves on the world stage.
*22:30.740- 22:34.340* :  On Tuesday, he met Ukraine's president Zelensky in Kiev
*22:34.340- 22:37.140* :  to put forward proposals for a ceasefire with Russia.
*22:37.620- 22:40.620* :  And on Friday, he was in Moscow to meet President Putin.
*22:41.220- 22:44.120* :  Mr. Orban is the EU's only head of national government
*22:44.120- 22:46.680* :  to maintain warm ties with Russia
*22:46.680- 22:49.740* :  since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
*22:50.640- 22:54.120* :  European leaders have now openly condemned the Moscow trip.
*22:54.900- 22:57.120* :  The European Commission spokesman is Eric Mama.
*22:57.120- 23:02.020* :  It is clear that whatever the messaging around the trip
*23:02.400- 23:05.580* :  from the Hungarians and from Prime Minister Orban,
*23:06.100- 23:09.140* :  the substance of this trip is not the right one.
*23:09.720- 23:12.340* :  This is about appeasement, it's not about peace.
*23:13.160- 23:16.280* :  And we believe that it undermines the unity
*23:16.280- 23:18.140* :  and determination that we need to show
*23:18.800- 23:20.920* :  in order for this war to end.
*23:21.560- 23:23.100* :  So what should we make of this visit?
*23:23.100- 23:26.460* :  I've been talking to our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg, in Moscow.
*23:26.880- 23:28.900* :  The whole story is quite extraordinary, isn't it?
*23:28.940- 23:32.820* :  Because just less than a week into the Hungarian presidency,
*23:33.400- 23:37.060* :  you have Victor Orban making this surprise visit to Moscow
*23:37.720- 23:41.140* :  and the EU saying, well, we didn't give you a mandate to go there
*23:41.700- 23:43.020* :  and all this talk about appeasement.
*23:43.320- 23:46.080* :  The view from Moscow, if you speak to the Hungarian delegation
*23:46.420- 23:50.400* :  as we did earlier in the Kremlin, they say, this is not appeasement.
*23:50.400- 23:51.180* :  This is dialogue.
*23:51.180- 23:54.360* :  We have to restore dialogue with the Russians, they say.
*23:54.880- 23:57.940* :  If we want to resolve the Ukraine conflict,
*23:58.520- 24:00.920* :  they completely reject the accusation.
*24:01.440- 24:04.260* :  But after three hours of talks with Russians,
*24:04.900- 24:05.780* :  was there a breakthrough?
*24:06.140- 24:07.540* :  Doesn't seem to have been a breakthrough.
*24:08.140- 24:10.880* :  President Putin and Prime Minister Orban came out,
*24:10.880- 24:14.020* :  made statements to a group of journalists we were there.
*24:14.560- 24:16.400* :  And President Putin, his position,
*24:16.400- 24:19.260* :  hadn't seemed to have changed one little bit.
*24:19.260- 24:23.640* :  He kept talking about his so-called peace plan, peace initiative,
*24:24.320- 24:26.360* :  which he presented a few weeks ago,
*24:26.880- 24:29.640* :  which is widely seen not as a peace plan,
*24:29.640- 24:34.140* :  but as an ultimatum, basically saying that Ukraine has to pull its troops
*24:34.980- 24:39.040* :  out of the Donbass and regions which Russia has partially occupied,
*24:39.060- 24:42.860* :  and also out of areas which are under Ukrainian control now.
*24:43.360- 24:46.860* :  This has seen as really an attempt to get Ukraine to capitulate.
*24:47.060- 24:50.300* :  So, Steve, if nothing of substance came out of this visit,
*24:50.880- 24:53.120* :  what about diplomatically for President Putin?
*24:53.120- 24:56.560* :  He has been isolated from pretty much the whole of Europe
*24:57.140- 24:59.300* :  since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
*24:59.920- 25:01.540* :  What did President Putin get out of this?
*25:01.780- 25:02.460* :  Yeah, absolutely.
*25:02.740- 25:07.140* :  And really, the Russians will have been well aware of the optics here,
*25:07.440- 25:10.360* :  the fact that there is a leader of a European country,
*25:10.360- 25:15.020* :  a country which has now taken over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU,
*25:15.680- 25:20.440* :  getting on a plane flying to Moscow to the Kremlin to sit down for talks
*25:20.940- 25:21.920* :  with Vladimir Putin.
*25:22.140- 25:25.760* :  This allows the Russian authorities to say,
*25:26.180- 25:27.520* :  we're not isolated at all,
*25:27.520- 25:29.920* :  we have European leaders coming to talk to us.
*25:30.400- 25:34.180* :  This, of course, is dominating the news bulletins here in Russia.
*25:34.180- 25:37.520* :  So, Russia can use this for its benefit.
*25:37.520- 25:38.800* :  There's no doubt about that.
*25:38.920- 25:43.920* :  And I often get the feeling that the Russian authorities like to look
*25:43.980- 25:48.980* :  for any opportunity they can to drive wedges between their opponents,
*25:49.340- 25:52.620* :  you know, looking at Europe, they try to befriend certain leaders.
*25:53.060- 25:55.860* :  They look for ways to spread division and disunity,
*25:55.860- 25:58.540* :  and I think they seem spotted an opportunity here.
*25:59.080- 26:00.400* :  Steve Rosenberg in Russia.
*26:01.580- 26:05.500* :  Ten days ago, parts of the parliamentary compound in the Kenyan capital,
*26:05.500- 26:07.140* :  Nairobi, were in flames.
*26:07.940- 26:12.700* :  People protesting about proposed tax rises had broken in, ransacking rooms.
*26:13.480- 26:16.120* :  The security forces responded with live fire,
*26:16.560- 26:19.460* :  at least 13 people were killed across the city.
*26:20.220- 26:23.700* :  The president, William Ruto, withdrew the controversial tax reforms,
*26:24.100- 26:28.120* :  and now he's taken to social media to speak directly to the young Kenyans,
*26:28.120- 26:29.820* :  who were involved in the protests.
*26:30.460- 26:33.640* :  It was a live session on X, formerly known as Twitter.
*26:34.140- 26:38.500* :  Our senior Africa correspondent Ann Sawy joined the president's online meeting.
*26:39.140- 26:41.380* :  It is a fast in almost any country.
*26:41.900- 26:44.960* :  The president, engaging with citizens on social media platforms,
*26:45.600- 26:49.100* :  and taking direct, raw and often hard-hitting questions.
*26:50.120- 26:53.780* :  But it had several false starts, and begun an hour late.
*26:54.320- 26:57.800* :  Sorry, gentlemen, about the technology has its own challenges,
*26:57.800- 27:00.920* :  but I hope I'm audible. I'm very happy to be here.
*27:01.320- 27:06.680* :  I'm excited to the request of many young people who say
*27:06.680- 27:10.420* :  I should come to X and have an engagement with them,
*27:10.420- 27:15.820* :  so that I can do the most important thing I have been accused of not doing.
*27:16.180- 27:17.800* :  The president had addressed the nation,
*27:17.800- 27:20.880* :  on national media, following two weeks of deadly protests.
*27:21.640- 27:24.080* :  But the young Kenyans who had organized themselves online,
*27:24.140- 27:28.120* :  before going to the streets, wanted him to meet them where they are,
*27:28.600- 27:29.540* :  on social media.
*27:29.900- 27:32.120* :  They were angry and disappointed at the government.
*27:32.960- 27:35.300* :  Do we really matter as people who elected you,
*27:35.480- 27:39.020* :  Asta Kanraman, who witnessed the killing of a protestor outside Parliament?
*27:40.000- 27:43.700* :  Have you reached out to any family member, asked another ex-user?
*27:44.620- 27:46.940* :  The often direct and sharp-shooting president,
*27:47.260- 27:51.940* :  for not showing empathy before, and promised to listen more to Kenyans?
*27:52.520- 27:55.980* :  I am immensely grateful for the feedback, immense feedback.
*27:56.300- 27:59.020* :  I have got on X.
*28:00.280- 28:04.000* :  In fact, I took a long time before coming to X.
*28:04.060- 28:08.600* :  I think I should be more often in this X space to engage with you guys
*28:08.600- 28:11.040* :  and to deal with situations there.
*28:11.320- 28:14.240* :  Listening to the feedback today on X,
*28:15.240- 28:16.920* :  I think I have gone home with,
*28:18.100- 28:19.080* :  I need to listen more,
*28:21.040- 28:22.160* :  I need more empathy,
*28:23.380- 28:25.220* :  and my administration needs more empathy.
*28:26.980- 28:30.400* :  And I have had you say, loudly, more action.
*28:30.800- 28:33.040* :  The online meeting lasted over two hours.
*28:33.780- 28:36.580* :  Participants peaked at 163,000,
*28:36.580- 28:39.040* :  with millions of views hours later.
*28:39.960- 28:43.440* :  It has no doubt changed the governance conversation in Kenya.
*28:43.720- 28:44.580* :  That was Ansoy.
*28:45.760- 28:49.620* :  The Vatican has announced the ex-communication of an archbishop
*28:49.620- 28:51.960* :  who is known to be a critic of Pope Francis,
*28:52.520- 28:56.240* :  after finding him guilty of schism or splitting the church.
*28:57.020- 28:59.660* :  The office in charge of enforcing church discipline,
*28:59.660- 29:05.360* :  said archbishop Carlo Maria Vigagno had refused to submit to the Pope.
*29:05.780- 29:07.340* :  Will Vernon has more details.
*29:07.880- 29:12.880* :  Archbishop Vigano is accused of refusing to recognise the legitimacy of church bodies,
*29:13.440- 29:15.500* :  and even of Pope Francis himself.
*29:16.280- 29:18.420* :  The archbishop is a controversial figure
*29:18.420- 29:21.180* :  who's appeared at far-right rallies in the US
*29:21.780- 29:26.420* :  and publicly criticises papal policies on LGBT people and migrants.
*29:26.420- 29:29.840* :  He has previously called for Pope Francis to resign.
*29:29.840- 29:33.560* :  Vigano also accuses the Pope of covering up child abuse,
*29:34.120- 29:35.500* :  which the Vatican denies.
*29:36.080- 29:38.760* :  Will Vernon, now, back to our main story.
*29:39.620- 29:42.760* :  Hours after his Labour Party was swept to office
*29:42.760- 29:44.560* :  with a massive electoral majority,
*29:45.140- 29:47.220* :  Britain's new Prime Minister, Keir Starmer,
*29:47.220- 29:49.940* :  on Friday assembled his senior government team.
*29:50.520- 29:52.740* :  So who exactly is Keir Starmer?
*29:53.460- 29:54.600* :  With this profile of him,
*29:54.600- 29:57.100* :  it's our political correspondent, Rob Watson.
*29:57.520- 30:01.220* :  I will lead this great party into a new era
*30:01.940- 30:04.200* :  with confidence and with hope
*30:05.380- 30:06.860* :  so that when the time comes,
*30:07.440- 30:10.380* :  we can serve our country again in government.
*30:11.020- 30:12.480* :  It was barely four years ago
*30:12.480- 30:16.300* :  that Keir Starmer became Labour leader in the middle of the Covid pandemic
*30:16.780- 30:18.700* :  and after the party's crushing defeat
*30:19.180- 30:21.580* :  under the hard-left leadership of Jeremy Corbyn
*30:21.580- 30:22.880* :  at the last general election.
*30:23.700- 30:27.380* :  So who is the man who has pulled off this extraordinary political turnaround
*30:27.380- 30:29.900* :  and what, if anything, is Starmerism?
*30:30.620- 30:32.520* :  By the standards of British Prime Ministers,
*30:32.880- 30:36.760* :  the 61-year-old Keir Starmer comes from a fairly ordinary background.
*30:36.760- 30:39.480* :  The son of a factory worker and a nurse,
*30:39.880- 30:41.800* :  he grew up in Surrey, south of London,
*30:42.240- 30:44.040* :  where childhood friend Paul Vickers
*30:44.500- 30:47.100* :  has this memory of the young Keir and his home.
*30:47.780- 30:48.660* :  I used to love going there.
*30:48.660- 30:50.100* :  It was always like a building site.
*30:50.820- 30:52.020* :  And there were holes in the wall.
*30:52.020- 30:53.960* :  There was bits of masonry missing.
*30:54.480- 30:56.140* :  It was always as though they were trying to finish the house
*30:56.140- 30:59.500* :  but never actually got quite around to completing the job.
*31:00.220- 31:01.780* :  Keir was always up to something,
*31:01.780- 31:05.680* :  whether it was football, practicing an instrument in the house.
*31:06.300- 31:07.400* :  It was a very joyful house.
*31:08.000- 31:10.460* :  There was always shouting. It was very energetic.
*31:11.160- 31:14.220* :  Keir Starmer was the first in his family to go to university,
*31:14.220- 31:16.820* :  studying law at Leeds and then Oxford
*31:16.820- 31:19.500* :  before becoming a successful human rights lawyer,
*31:20.140- 31:23.620* :  often defending those accused of terrorism and extremism,
*31:23.940- 31:25.860* :  earning him the lefty lawyer label
*31:26.200- 31:27.460* :  from his political opponents.
*31:28.320- 31:29.980* :  But the defender turned prosecutor,
*31:30.720- 31:34.120* :  ending up as head of the government's entire prosecution service
*31:34.800- 31:35.940* :  in 2008.
*31:36.640- 31:38.700* :  Keir Starmer, label party,
*31:39.640- 31:41.780* :  29,062.
*31:42.740- 31:45.760* :  Although always interested in politics and the man of the left,
*31:45.760- 31:48.480* :  it wasn't until relatively late in his career
*31:48.800- 31:51.620* :  that he became an elected politician in 2015.
*31:52.520- 31:54.100* :  As to his true political beliefs,
*31:54.560- 31:57.120* :  there have been accusations he has a man of little faith.
*31:57.920- 31:59.860* :  Someone who passionately supported remain,
*31:59.860- 32:02.420* :  but now says Brexit must be made to work,
*32:02.940- 32:04.880* :  and who once backed Jeremy Corbyn
*32:05.020- 32:06.860* :  before kicking him out of the party.
*32:07.660- 32:11.360* :  Apparently unbothered by such allegations of ideological drift,
*32:11.960- 32:14.540* :  Starmer defines his politics pragmatically
*32:14.540- 32:18.020* :  as a mission to help ordinary families like his own.
*32:18.640- 32:21.420* :  That determination to change things for the better,
*32:21.620- 32:23.020* :  and by which I mean,
*32:23.640- 32:26.780* :  the living standards of families across the country,
*32:26.780- 32:28.800* :  families like my family when I was growing up,
*32:29.180- 32:32.120* :  to give them what I've always called the ordinary hope
*32:32.360- 32:34.900* :  that particularly working-class families want.
*32:35.140- 32:37.560* :  That's what stirs me to reach that place,
*32:37.560- 32:40.100* :  to change their lives, to have that opportunity.
*32:40.980- 32:42.700* :  Despite his extraordinary success,
*32:43.380- 32:46.760* :  polling suggests he remains personally unloved.
*32:47.180- 32:49.020* :  Speaking before the election campaign,
*32:49.020- 32:53.000* :  the commentator Rachel Silvester and admirer of Starmer's
*32:53.120- 32:55.580* :  thinks it's partly because he doesn't give much away
*32:55.580- 32:57.820* :  about his feelings or his politics.
*32:58.420- 33:01.760* :  I think because he had quite a tough upbringing in a way,
*33:02.140- 33:06.900* :  he's not immediately open-spirited empathetic kind of person.
*33:06.960- 33:09.840* :  He comes across, I think, probably to most people as decent,
*33:10.440- 33:12.680* :  they can imagine him on the steps of number 10,
*33:13.240- 33:15.720* :  but they're not quite sure what he stands for still.
*33:16.280- 33:19.100* :  What we do know about Keir Starmer outside politics
*33:19.120- 33:21.940* :  is that he loves football, both playing it still,
*33:21.940- 33:23.920* :  and watching it, and music,
*33:24.540- 33:27.720* :  and that family life, his wife and two children are key.
*33:28.500- 33:30.120* :  Indeed, in a BBC interview last year,
*33:30.120- 33:33.840* :  he said protecting his family would be his biggest concern,
*33:34.400- 33:35.500* :  not running the country.
*33:35.920- 33:39.000* :  I'm really not daunted about the difficult decisions
*33:39.000- 33:41.380* :  we'll have to make in government if we get that far.
*33:42.220- 33:43.300* :  I am worried about my children.
*33:43.560- 33:46.900* :  That is probably the single thing that does keep me awake
*33:46.920- 33:49.700* :  as to how we will protect them through this.
*33:49.900- 33:52.300* :  In the same interview, he had an interesting insight
*33:52.640- 33:56.300* :  into how the country had changed from when Labour last won in 1997
*33:56.300- 33:59.780* :  under Tony Blair after a long period of Conservative government,
*33:59.780- 34:03.000* :  and now, then it was all cool Britannia
*34:03.000- 34:04.380* :  and things can only get better.
*34:05.020- 34:08.020* :  Now, the mood is bleaker and people less trusting.
*34:08.500- 34:12.280* :  I think there's a real sense of concern, of insecurity,
*34:13.120- 34:16.100* :  and people want a Labour party,
*34:16.140- 34:19.160* :  and if we're privileged enough to serve a Labour government
*34:19.160- 34:22.300* :  to well together the reassurance that they need
*34:22.840- 34:24.880* :  with the hope that things can change,
*34:25.140- 34:26.560* :  and it's a different mood,
*34:26.720- 34:28.900* :  and we have to get that absolutely spot on.
*34:29.520- 34:31.060* :  These are indeed gloomy at times,
*34:31.140- 34:34.020* :  but then that also means no one is expecting Mr Starma
