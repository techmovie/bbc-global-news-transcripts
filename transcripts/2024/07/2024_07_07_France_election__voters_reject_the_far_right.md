*01:49.660- 01:54.480* :  The prominent US congressman Adam Schiff says vice president Kamala Harris could beat Donald
*01:54.480- 01:58.900* :  Trump as concerns continue over Joe Biden's recent public performance.
*02:01.240- 02:07.900* :  Also in this podcast the Ukrainian amputee soldiers treated at a US medical center and after a
*02:07.900- 02:18.200* :  year living in a sealed room in Texas. These people can tell us what it might be like
*02:18.200- 02:26.700* :  to live on Mars. The French president Emmanuel Macron took a big gamble when he called a snap
*02:26.700- 02:32.180* :  parliamentary election after the far-right National Rally success in last month European elections.
*02:32.880- 02:37.460* :  Last Sunday's first round of voting saw the National Rally, the former National Front of
*02:37.460- 02:43.580* :  Jean-Marie Le Pen renamed and rebranded by his daughter Marine, come top again. But candidates from
*02:43.580- 02:49.220* :  a hastily formed left-wing coalition, the new popular front, struck deals with those from the
*02:49.220- 02:54.520* :  president's centrist alliance in a bid to stop the National Rally from winning again in the second round.
*02:54.520- 03:00.300* :  As soon as the polls had closed early projections confirmed the tactic had worked even better than
*03:00.820- 03:00.840* :  expected.
*03:16.100- 03:19.980* :  In announcement on French television that the National Rally had been beaten into third place
*03:19.980- 03:24.740* :  and wouldn't be forming a government after all. A few minutes after that news broke, I spoke to
*03:24.740- 03:30.900* :  our correspondent in Paris Huesco Field. It is a huge surprise. We were all led to believe by
*03:30.900- 03:34.900* :  the polls that even though the National Rally would go down in this round, it would still
*03:34.900- 03:40.600* :  get mergers the biggest party, but the pollsters got it all wrong. We got it all wrong. The biggest
*03:40.600- 03:45.780* :  party it seems from this is the left. The left-wing alliance that comprises everyone from the
*03:45.780- 03:52.120* :  sort of socialist, soft left socialist all the way to pretty hard-line anti-capitalist, but they
*03:52.120- 03:57.780* :  formed this coalition which meant that left-wing candidates stood down everywhere to concentrate the
*03:57.780- 04:04.600* :  vote and that there was then in many places an alliance with the centrist so that there was
*04:04.940- 04:11.440* :  a focused anti-RN vote in many constituencies and clearly this tactic worked because the RN
*04:11.440- 04:16.420* :  share of the vote has gone down and their projection seats, which is what really counts, is
*04:16.720- 04:22.640* :  is way down. I mean we're talking maybe of them coming in third place behind both the left-wing
*04:22.640- 04:29.900* :  alliance and even Macron's Osombo party. So it's a big bucket of cold water over the hard
*04:29.900- 04:34.780* :  right today and of course this evening and of course victory celebrations go on now in the
*04:34.780- 04:39.520* :  Place de la République in eastern Paris where the left has gathered nervously up until a few minutes
*04:39.520- 04:44.360* :  ago but now with great joy as they realise that they've actually emerged essentially the victors
*04:44.360- 04:49.700* :  of this election. It's obviously not good for Macron's own party but does this outcome now mean
*04:49.700- 04:54.500* :  that his gamble in calling the election and then forming this alliance has paid off?
*04:55.100- 04:59.840* :  It's not that bad for his party again compared to what everyone's expecting. They're
*04:59.840- 05:03.980* :  going to be sort of shaking their heads and disbelieving and how fortunate they've been because
*05:03.980- 05:10.680* :  if they come out with 150 to 175 seats as it predicted yes that's way down on what they had before
*05:11.320- 05:17.560* :  but they're still in the game very much so and in what's going to happen now which is a
*05:17.560- 05:23.960* :  prolonged period of haggling and parliamentary style negotiations the Osombo party in the middle
*05:23.960- 05:28.540* :  of the centre even though they're not the biggest will will form the kind of hinge block I mean no
*05:28.960- 05:33.640* :  no no coalition will be possible without them they'll they'll you know if there's there's a
*05:33.640- 05:38.980* :  coalition that needs to be broad based and between a little bit of the little bit of the right and
*05:38.980- 05:43.580* :  a little bit of an a large bit of the left the centre will also play a part in that so they
*05:43.580- 05:51.220* :  they've come out of this remarkably well again a sign of how well this anti-RN kind of front
*05:51.340- 05:57.220* :  has has worked in this election kelly more people still do not want the RN to take power in
*05:57.220- 06:02.500* :  France than wanted to even though in the first round they did so well and in the Europeans that
*06:02.500- 06:07.200* :  they did so well a correspondent he used to go fill with me from Paris let's get some reaction
*06:07.200- 06:12.680* :  now from some people in France his third largest city leo just after those predictions came in
*06:12.980- 06:19.860* :  I'm a political science student so I follow the results of the election and I'm very happy that
*06:20.860- 06:26.000* :  the right didn't win because it was really a dangerous for us because I know that they will
*06:26.240- 06:33.720* :  like privates or rights especially like rights to to to to speak freedom to to to say what we want
*06:33.720- 06:41.380* :  to say so we're really happy we're very happy and it's not like it's not the end because there is
*06:41.380- 06:48.460* :  a lot of people who vote right and we know that in 2027 for the presidency I know that
*06:48.500- 06:54.020* :  it would be complicated so we have to stay in touch and and see so happy yeah
*06:56.320- 07:01.540* :  if you want to tell me anything more say to you she's broken I'm so sorry but I'm very happy
*07:01.540- 07:07.780* :  because it's a it's the end of the rich for for France and for the for the commune decision I'm sorry
*07:07.940- 07:16.740* :  for young people yeah and I'm so happy since right now the left seems to be a bit ahead
*07:16.780- 07:26.640* :  I'm kind of hopeful because we never never had that and so we'll see in like maybe two hours but
*07:27.640- 07:35.000* :  for now I'm I'm hopeful I kind of lost hope but starting to to come back and did it come as a
*07:35.000- 07:40.140* :  surprise were you expecting that first prediction it was a surprise I was very stressed that
*07:40.300- 07:48.560* :  would pass but give them this relief prediction I am more optimistic back in Paris huge crowds
*07:48.560- 07:54.040* :  supporting the left gathered the plastula republic the hard left leader Jean-Luc Miller-Shant told
*07:54.040- 08:05.840* :  them he was immensely relieved by the result we are so immensely relieved you see you see
*08:09.420- 08:20.180* :  one way or another tonight we are now allowed to do something that we did doubt we have to admit
*08:21.160- 08:27.820* :  we are allowed to love our country I corresponded as Eddie Machiri told me a bit more about the
*08:27.820- 08:33.700* :  atmosphere there I don't know if you can hear the sound around me but it isn't even as loud as
*08:33.700- 08:39.480* :  when the result actually came in it was absolute jubilation and now there is music and there is
*08:39.480- 08:44.200* :  chanting there's a building nearby it's a building where Jean-Luc Miller-Shant gave his speech
*08:44.200- 08:51.480* :  a few moments ago and he has come out several times as have his colleagues and other members of
*08:51.480- 08:58.320* :  the new popular front waving outside of a window and as soon as they appear there are just
*08:58.320- 09:03.440* :  cheese erupting around here and yet behind me is a screen where they've been broadcasting
*09:04.320- 09:11.720* :  French broadcasters commentators each time Jordan Bardela's name is mentioned the new face
*09:11.720- 09:18.380* :  of the rassemblement national there is booing I do want to mention though even though they've been
*09:18.380- 09:25.240* :  completely united in oh there are those booze even though they've been united there it is again
*09:25.240- 09:32.360* :  in those booing in those cheerings not everyone supports left host al-Soumi is not everyone supports
*09:32.360- 09:39.960* :  Jean-Luc Miller-Shant but they do support an alliance that has kept the far right at bay somewhat
*09:40.620- 09:45.640* :  and we should point out that it isn't Paris that's the the place where the national rally has
*09:45.640- 09:49.620* :  big support right so the fact that he's being booed there is probably no great surprise
*09:50.620- 09:56.340* :  absolutely just this morning and over the weekend I was in burgundy in a town called
*09:56.340- 10:02.240* :  Uzair and that has been a place where the national rally has dominated local politics
*10:03.360- 10:08.380* :  some booing again has dominated local politics for four years you wouldn't hear that booing over
*10:08.380- 10:14.800* :  there it used to be a fertile ground for socialist candidates but they have felt that the cost
*10:14.800- 10:20.380* :  of living has become too difficult they can't find jobs they struggle to make the end of the
*10:20.380- 10:27.860* :  month to pay their bills and they believe that the answer is the far right they were hoping that
*10:27.860- 10:34.900* :  in this historic election marine repents party would take over government part of that is because
*10:34.900- 10:41.420* :  they believe that Mac Hall the centrist project that he's created has caused some of their problems
*10:41.420- 10:48.180* :  they think he himself is arrogant one person said he's a king that he thinks he's trials the third
*10:48.180- 10:52.600* :  they do not believe that he's in touch with their day-to-day problems and marine
*10:52.600- 10:56.580* :  repents messaging Jordan Martinez messaging it cut through in those areas
*10:57.040- 11:01.700* :  I correspond and I said in my sherry with me now it's a very different atmosphere at the headquarters
*11:01.700- 11:08.160* :  of the far right national rally party they had hoped to be celebrating instead huge disappointment
*11:08.220- 11:13.580* :  their leader Jordan by the last said what he called an alliance of dishonor had kept his party out
*11:13.580- 11:21.480* :  of power tonight I say this very seriously depriving millions of French people from the
*11:21.480- 11:29.080* :  possibility will never be a viable destiny for France parties former president marine
*11:29.080- 11:34.480* :  lapen said the project to result only delayed its victory my colleague James Kumar Asami spoke
*11:34.480- 11:40.300* :  to Mark Lohan who's at the HQ of the national rally I think it's a mixture of real disappointment
*11:40.300- 11:44.240* :  I mean some some of the supporters that I have spoken to said there's one woman said I you know
*11:44.240- 11:50.460* :  we're sad we're disappointed we even feel struck down by this result actually talked about the
*11:50.460- 11:56.460* :  un the dishonest alliance that had been formed to keep them out of power but then another chap I
*11:56.460- 11:59.880* :  spoke to tried to put positive spill on it and he said you know we've got to look at the facts we
*11:59.880- 12:05.600* :  have massively increased the number of MPs that we have in parliament and you know we will
*12:06.600- 12:11.420* :  we are the future of French politics now who knows whether that is true I think the strategy of
*12:11.420- 12:17.280* :  the national rally will be to say look that the will be to hope I think Jamie that the whichever
*12:17.280- 12:23.980* :  government emerges from this mess will be so driven by factionalism and disunity that actually
*12:23.980- 12:28.720* :  it plays into the hands of the national rally and that in 2027 in the presidential election
*12:28.720- 12:33.200* :  Malin Le Pen can say well look this is what happens when we are blocked from power who knows
*12:33.200- 12:38.520* :  whether that will work time and time again the you know the other side of this country and the
*12:38.520- 12:43.480* :  majority in this country take a look at the national rally and at the 11th hour they call back
*12:43.860- 12:47.380* :  and they you know that has happened once again tonight they have just thought we are not quite
*12:47.720- 12:53.760* :  prepared to bring them into power yes I mean it's interesting that blocked from power narrative
*12:53.820- 13:00.460* :  given that this has happened at the at the ballot boxes that as you say that the French people
*13:01.260- 13:07.120* :  have voted and they have voted it would appear to reject the national rally I mean I wonder how
*13:07.780- 13:13.740* :  easy it will be to continue that narrative I mean I think today we'll say look people did not
*13:13.740- 13:20.700* :  necessarily vote for former court or for the left they voted for a candidate who in the hell
*13:20.700- 13:24.840* :  their nose is and voted for a candidate that would you know that would that would oppose the
*13:24.840- 13:30.280* :  national rally I mean look it is it is a complicated way in which the French vote it's not something
*13:30.280- 13:37.520* :  that's unheard of here I mean often there is tactical voting in this country to stop the far
*13:37.520- 13:42.840* :  right I mean going back to you know more than 20 years or so to stop Jean Malin Le Pen from
*13:42.840- 13:47.120* :  getting into power as the presidential candidate when he reached the second round run off with
*13:47.120- 13:52.100* :  Jack Shirag I mean people do do this in France so yes that narrative only holds way to some extent
*13:52.100- 13:57.080* :  but I mean I think that there is a lot of frustration from the third or so of the country that
*13:57.400- 14:01.320* :  that supports the national rally that says look you know this is a party that is ready for power
*14:01.320- 14:06.200* :  and once again we've been thwarted it will now be they will now look at what comes out of this
*14:06.200- 14:10.180* :  what government comes out of this and whichever government takes power Jamie will know that their
*14:10.180- 14:14.960* :  sole motivation really will be or not sole motivation but one of the largest motivations will be
*14:15.300- 14:20.440* :  to be effective to show that they can govern so that the France is not here once again in the
*14:20.440- 14:24.900* :  presidential election 2027 and the next parliamentary election you know pulling back from the
*14:24.900- 14:29.160* :  green could be 11th hour Mark Loewen one of our team of correspondence in Paris

*16:12.440- 16:18.440* :  can Joe Biden hang on as the presidential candidate in the US election many democrats are concerned
*16:18.440- 16:24.060* :  about his fitness for office the latest is the prominent US congressman Adam Schiff he's given
*16:24.060- 16:29.560* :  an interview for US television the NBC networks meet the press program in which he suggested vice
*16:29.560- 16:35.040* :  president Kamala Harris could beat Donald Trump I think the vice president would be a phenomenal
*16:35.040- 16:39.820* :  president I think she has the experience the judgment the leadership ability to be an extraordinary
*16:39.820- 16:44.720* :  president which you win overwhelmingly congressman I think she very well could win overwhelmingly but
*16:45.040- 16:50.120* :  before we get into a decision about who else it should be the president's make decision whether
*16:50.120- 16:55.880* :  it's him down balance is Washington posts veteran political writer what does he think he's going on
*16:55.880- 17:01.660* :  Biden's in a circle right now the president publicly at least is determined to hold on uh he's
*17:01.660- 17:06.740* :  basically telling his critics come out from behind those anonymous quotes and let's see whether
*17:06.740- 17:12.220* :  there really is critical mass within the party for me to go I think privately I'm having talked
*17:12.220- 17:17.840* :  to some people who have known him for a long long time he's probably weighing this in a fairly
*17:17.840- 17:23.940* :  intelligent way and trying to decide in the long run not just what's best for him according to
*17:23.940- 17:28.220* :  these people but what is best for the party in the country immediately after the debate when
*17:28.220- 17:33.140* :  there was so much alarm the campaign team did a pretty good job of kind of tamping it down and
*17:33.200- 17:39.460* :  that held for a couple of days and then last week it started rising again congress has been out
*17:39.460- 17:45.920* :  for the July 4th holiday week and they return this coming week and that will be the critical moment
*17:46.220- 17:51.580* :  if he were to step aside he likely would say vice president Harris should become the nominee
*17:52.240- 17:55.740* :  there would be several governors who would probably come forward and put themselves
*17:56.300- 18:00.580* :  to be a potential candidate so the democrats are in the terrible dilemma right now
*18:01.020- 18:04.800* :  and no clear path uh and no consensus on what's the right way forward
*18:05.340- 18:11.560* :  Matthew Barzun was US ambassador to London at the time Joe Biden was vice president James Naughty
*18:11.560- 18:17.460* :  asked him to reflect on his predicament look I think in the case of president Biden in his career
*18:18.520- 18:25.680* :  and in his administration you have seen him demonstrate his ability to let go trust an
*18:25.680- 18:32.580* :  amazing secretary of state like Tony Blinken to empower members of his cabinet and his staff
*18:32.580- 18:39.180* :  he has built people's trust by doing the right thing and I think he has decisions to make now
*18:39.180- 18:44.040* :  that will prove whether that remain his legacy and I hope it will one can only imagine
*18:44.140- 18:50.520* :  that there are some pretty tough conversations going on among friends around the president
*18:50.520- 18:56.200* :  at the moment I think within my political party is a democrat what many are calling for is we
*18:56.200- 19:01.200* :  need to talk about this and work through it and not dismiss it and not demonize it and that's
*19:01.200- 19:06.920* :  what I'm hoping will happen in these coming days you know to be absolutely frank about it those
*19:06.920- 19:12.500* :  who believe that there is a danger of him carrying on past the point where he can convince the
*19:12.500- 19:18.300* :  American people that he is up to it is now pretty serious from the point of view of people in
*19:18.300- 19:26.280* :  your party it is it is and I and I don't want in this conversation to go too much far I mean I'm
*19:26.520- 19:32.000* :  deeply sympathetic with my friends who are there in the middle of the campaign doing this and I
*19:32.000- 19:38.880* :  know I'm not deep into it as I was before and I think people are speaking at people want to have
*19:38.880- 19:46.300* :  a conversation a really serious one and that conversation needs to be had we really can come out
*19:46.300- 19:51.620* :  stronger through this so it shouldn't be shot away from we should embrace it and it could evolve
*19:51.620- 19:58.600* :  into inter party recriminations and splintering of course it could it doesn't have to finally just
*19:59.160- 20:05.220* :  picking up that you were in a massacred when Joe Biden was vice president so you saw him in that
*20:05.220- 20:14.200* :  role and you know how he operates and how his political antennae operate it's surely impossible
*20:14.200- 20:22.360* :  to imagine that he does not understand that many friends would like him to make a decision that
*20:22.360- 20:30.600* :  meant he didn't carry on through to November I think he's incredibly perceptive and wise and so
*20:31.020- 20:39.420* :  yes I have trust that he will really listen and it's hard I mean I can't imagine what it's
*20:39.420- 20:46.720* :  like in that position but yes to really listen and the tricky part and I have I was a friend of mine
*20:46.720- 20:52.020* :  who's a crisis management counselor said that one of the hardest things about a crisis which he
*20:52.020- 20:57.720* :  finds himself in and many of us have found ourselves in is that you want to turn to those closest
*20:57.720- 21:03.300* :  to you your closest family and friends but sort of perversely they are the least well-equipped
*21:03.300- 21:08.340* :  to give you the kind of information you need because they're so close to you and so you really do
*21:08.340- 21:13.500* :  need to make sure that you are listening to a wider group and that you don't lose your peripheral
*21:13.500- 21:20.080* :  vision and while it may seem like focus to you it can end up being tunnel vision and limiting
*21:20.080- 21:30.260* :  the scope people have to be frank they do and loving and caring format us ambassador to London
*21:30.260- 21:36.860* :  Matthew Barzin Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine now in its third years killed tens of
*21:36.860- 21:42.280* :  thousands of people and left many more with lost limbs and other life-changing injuries while the
*21:42.280- 21:47.340* :  Ukrainian government keeps casualty figures under wraps in a bid to keep up morale the future for
*21:47.340- 21:52.420* :  Ukraine foundation estimates there have been as many as a hundred thousand amputation since the
*21:52.420- 21:57.620* :  start of the conflict the charity is working with the U.S. Medical Center to take soldiers over
*21:57.620- 22:01.400* :  for treatment our correspondent Helena Humphrey has been to meet some of them
*22:02.940- 22:08.580* :  kick your head up with every tentative step on his new prosthetic legs you can see our leg
*22:08.580- 22:15.060* :  growing confidence remembering who he was before the war his new legs made of shiny metal attached
*22:15.060- 22:20.640* :  just below his hips on the battlefield of Bachmout in eastern Ukraine he lost nearly his entire
*22:20.640- 22:28.380* :  lower body a memory that stays with him there were a lot of drones flying over my position
*22:28.380- 22:33.820* :  and one dropped a grenade directly into my trench and since we had a lot of ammunition it detonated
*22:34.220- 22:39.540* :  and there was a wave of explosions wounding my legs I put the turnickets on but we were under
*22:39.540- 22:43.180* :  constant fire I had to wait 10 hours to be evacuated
*22:43.860- 22:48.940* :  Oleg was told he'd spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair prosthetic limbs and rehabilitation
*22:48.940- 22:55.660* :  are hard to combine a country still in the group of war but here at a clinic in Maryland in the
*22:55.660- 23:01.500* :  United States at least 40 Ukrainian soldiers have received prosthetic devices paid for through
*23:01.500- 23:07.940* :  charitable donations and for Oleg being able to heal has also given him back a sense of hope
*23:08.380- 23:12.940* :  the first time that you were able to put legs on what was that feeling like
*23:12.940- 23:18.860* :  when you jumbled it the key it felt like when you haven't eaten for a long time and then finally
*23:18.860- 23:26.240* :  you have food it was a huge joy it was on top of the world number hind at all is Mike Corcoran
*23:26.680- 23:31.940* :  the decades he's helped countless US soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan to walk again
*23:32.360- 23:35.860* :  but he tells me even he couldn't fathom what he saw in Ukraine
*23:36.240- 23:41.900* :  the numbers we were told are 50 times the number that the United States suffered in 20 years of war
*23:41.900- 23:47.480* :  we were told is about 100,000 amputees when I was last in Kiev we went to one of the hospitals
*23:47.660- 23:55.440* :  and it was just full of combat injuries they couldn't take care of their own it's just
*23:56.120- 24:01.820* :  staggering the numbers western military surgeons say they haven't seen injuries on this scale
*24:01.820- 24:07.600* :  since World War II and that means Ukrainian health care infrastructure and society will have to
*24:07.600- 24:14.200* :  adapt to meet the needs of their war wounded this is one way we're just down the street from the
*24:14.200- 24:21.160* :  rehabilitation center in this workshop they're making prosthetic limbs and a toly is carefully
*24:21.160- 24:27.480* :  pouring liquid resin into a leg-shaped mold he also lost a leg in the war he's here in the United
*24:27.480- 24:32.740* :  States being trained by Mike Corcoran learning the crucial skills needed to meet the demand for
*24:32.740- 24:39.800* :  medical devices back home together they'll open a new prosthetic center back in Kiev as the conflict
*24:39.800- 24:45.860* :  grinds into its third year some wounded soldiers likely won't be returning to the front lines but
*24:45.860- 24:51.000* :  like an a toly they're still finding ways to be part of the war effort and prepare the country for
*24:51.000- 24:58.000* :  the future I will be able to help my brother so much my brothers now without legs without arms
*24:58.780- 25:06.760* :  unfortunately but it's my will be my small part for to help them here we go soon your arms
*25:07.380- 25:13.260* :  back at the clinic 23 of Ladislav is nearly done with his rehabilitation he's the youngest soldier
*25:13.260- 25:19.280* :  to be treated here after losing both of his legs to a mine the staff tell me that Ladislav's grit
*25:19.280- 25:24.960* :  and determination mean the progress he's made in just weeks would usually take a year
*25:26.320- 25:32.100* :  now Ladislav walks outside his new legs partially hidden under his battle for teaks
*25:36.600- 25:42.600* :  I don't know how to describe this emotion some kind of elation to live a full life as a normal person
*25:43.720- 25:46.740* :  and maybe I can even serve again in another branch and be helpful
*25:46.740- 25:53.300* :  we're going to the right tomorrow he'll head back to Ukraine still unsure of what comes next
*25:57.300- 26:03.240* :  that report from Helena Humphrey now imagine spending more than a year cooped up in a confined space
*26:03.240- 26:09.680* :  with only three other people and no contact with anyone else four volunteers have done just that
*26:09.680- 26:15.460* :  in the name of science the NASA base in Texas the experiment was designed to simulate life on
*26:15.460- 26:21.640* :  Mars in preparation for a future mission there they've now emerged from their 158th square meter room
*26:30.620- 26:35.400* :  in Texas and Aslam takes up the story that's the moment Kelly Hastin Ross Brockwell Nathan Jones
*26:35.400- 26:42.680* :  and Ancus Lario left the more simulator that's been their home for the past 378 days the 3D printed
*26:42.680- 26:48.120* :  habitat was designed to feel like an isolated red planet outpost that replicates the planet's
*26:48.120- 26:53.720* :  unique challenges the volunteers spent most of their time simulating operations future astronauts
*26:53.720- 26:59.280* :  will have to do including going for Mars walks in a red sand pit growing in harvesting vegetables
*26:59.280- 27:05.620* :  and dealing with a 22-minute communication lag with Earth NASA wants to know how the group got on
*27:05.620- 27:11.380* :  with the experiment and their prolonged isolation at a press conference all four appear to be in high
*27:11.380- 27:18.280* :  spirits to pew one has been a unique experience with great challenges joys and sorrows and a lot of
*27:18.280- 27:23.700* :  hard work with a fair bit of fun thrown in as well I'd like to say thank you to these crewmates thanks
*27:23.700- 27:29.820* :  for tolerating my experiment and hair science I've got a million thoughts just kind of racing through
*27:29.820- 27:37.460* :  my head right now for instance you know wow that went by quickly and as a position I'm so glad
*27:37.460- 27:42.880* :  that my life events led me here instead of being a proctologist I am astonished but I got to
*27:42.880- 27:50.840* :  contribute to the one thing that is dearest to my heart bringing life to Mars this mock Mars mission
*27:50.840- 27:56.360* :  is a crucial step in NASA's plan to set foot on the red planet by the early 2040s the volunteers
*27:56.360- 28:01.440* :  were thanked for devoting a year of their lives to serve humanity's exploration of space
*28:02.620- 28:08.560* :  John Landau who produced James Cameron's epic Titanic an avatar to the biggest films of all time
*28:08.560- 28:15.300* :  has died to cancer at the age of 63 Titanic which won John Landau and Oscar was the first film to
*28:15.300- 28:20.100* :  earn a billion dollars at the box office Peter Jackson who made the Lord of the Rings trilogy
*28:20.100- 28:25.960* :  described him as one of cinema's monumental figures genie wolf is a Hollywood entertainment reporter
*28:25.960- 28:31.780* :  who interviewed him the audience doesn't know John Landau but the industry does and they're very
*28:31.780- 28:39.060* :  saddened because he was one of the most congenial passionate lover of films and a great producer
*28:39.580- 28:46.480* :  and so I think the film community really is shaken by his loss he said look I can't compose
*28:46.480- 28:52.960* :  I can't act he started as a film executive and he said I guess that's why I'm producing
*28:53.020- 29:00.720* :  but let's remember James Cameron always wanted the most elaborate the most expensive production
*29:00.720- 29:07.320* :  and you needed a producer to keep things calm and in shape and get the money people interested
*29:07.820- 29:16.560* :  John Landau was a doll a darling man he talked about the fact that he took Titanic because he cried when
*29:24.000- 29:28.700* :  he read this script and if you asked him what's your favorite part of producing he would say I
*29:28.700- 29:35.180* :  like to be there in the audience when the audience is first seeing the film I like to look at the
*29:35.180- 29:41.320* :  faces I like to feel what they're feeling I like to feel when they're restless so I know if anything
*29:41.320- 29:47.500* :  needs to be cut honestly it was just wonderful to be around him because he took these gigantic
*29:47.740- 29:56.560* :  number one films and let them tell a message let them spread the word to society that Titanic
*29:56.560- 30:03.100* :  was a film about the people not about the sinking of the ship but about the great characters who
*30:03.100- 30:11.100* :  were part of that film same with Avatar I came like this this you I turned I feel the wind I
*30:11.100- 30:19.260* :  turned very strong I wanted to protect all those performances he was incredibly proud of what
*30:19.260- 30:26.540* :  they achieved and incredibly proud that they passed on an ecological a climate saving message
*30:26.540- 30:31.900* :  without hitting people on the head that was his life and that was the legacy that he leaves
