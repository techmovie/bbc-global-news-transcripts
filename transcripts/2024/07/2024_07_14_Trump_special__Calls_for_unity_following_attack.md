*01:27.820- 01:34.640* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 13 hours GMT on Sunday the 14th of July, this is a special
*01:34.640- 01:36.500* :  edition of the Global News Podcast.
*01:37.000- 01:42.180* :  Donald Trump urges Americans to unite in the face of wickedness after he narrowly survives
*01:42.180- 01:43.660* :  an assassination attempt.
*01:44.160- 01:48.260* :  There's been international condemnation of the attack which took place in a rally in
*01:48.260- 01:48.640* :  the US.
*01:49.300- 01:50.440* :  President Joe Biden said,
*01:50.780- 01:53.180* :  There's no place in America for this kind of violence.
*01:53.180- 01:53.900* :  It's sick.
*01:54.420- 02:00.120* :  We look at the implications for the election campaign and we ask, how was the gunman able
*02:00.120- 02:01.640* :  to get so close?
*02:04.280- 02:09.800* :  Donald Trump says evil will not be allowed to win after he survived an attempt on his life
*02:10.120- 02:12.060* :  during an outdoor rally in Pennsylvania.
*02:12.700- 02:16.200* :  One person in the crowd was killed and two others are in a critical condition.
*02:16.780- 02:20.580* :  The attacker who opened fire from a nearby rooftop was shot dead.
*02:21.120- 02:26.860* :  The FBI has identified him as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks from Pennsylvania.
*02:27.620- 02:29.900* :  Investigators are working to establish a motive.
*02:30.440- 02:32.880* :  Our correspondent, Gary O'Donohue, was at the rally.
*02:33.660- 02:38.200* :  Just minutes into the rally, shots rang out across this outdoor venue.
*02:38.300- 02:41.340* :  You want to really see something that said, take a look at what happened.
*02:49.460- 02:51.560* :  Donald Trump clutched at the side of his head.
*02:52.000- 02:56.100* :  He then hit the ground, secret service personnel piling on top of him.
*02:56.440- 03:00.200* :  Their job to put their bodies between him and the shooter.
*03:00.700- 03:06.300* :  Then he was up on his feet, blood at his right ear, and his fist raised, whisked away
*03:06.300- 03:06.940* :  to hospital.
*03:07.580- 03:12.540* :  In the minutes after, one eyewitness Greg, the owner of a local business, told us something
*03:13.380- 03:13.420* :  extraordinary.
*03:13.420- 03:17.460* :  He'd seen the shooter and tried to warn the security services.
*03:17.740- 03:21.820* :  We noticed the guy crawling out the roof 50 feet away from us.
*03:22.020- 03:23.640* :  We could clearly see him with a rifle.
*03:23.920- 03:26.520* :  The police are down there running around on the ground.
*03:26.520- 03:29.900* :  We're like, hey man, there's a guy on the roof with a rifle.
*03:30.360- 03:32.900* :  In the police, we're like, oh what, like they didn't know what was going on.
*03:32.940- 03:35.980* :  You know, we're like, hey right here on the roof, we can see him from right here.
*03:36.440- 03:38.680* :  And next thing you know, five shots rang out.
*03:38.960- 03:41.180* :  In the moments after the shooting, there was panic.
*03:41.760- 03:42.300* :  Many ran.
*03:42.640- 03:44.280* :  Many simply fell to the ground.
*03:44.780- 03:50.120* :  Mr. Trump later described hearing a whizzing sound and feeling the bullet go through his
*03:50.280- 03:50.560* :  ear.
*03:50.880- 03:56.240* :  The FBI is now in charge of this investigation and investigation into an attempted political
*03:56.240- 03:58.700* :  assassination in modern-day America.
*03:59.320- 04:04.020* :  Gary O'Donnellhue within an hour of the attack President Biden gave a televised address
*04:04.020- 04:08.820* :  in which he said he was grateful that Donald Trump was safe and he condemned the shooting.
*04:09.400- 04:11.880* :  There's no place in America for this kind of violence.
*04:12.080- 04:12.600* :  It's sick.
*04:13.300- 04:13.820* :  It's sick.
*04:14.600- 04:16.460* :  It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country.
*04:16.980- 04:19.100* :  We cannot allow for this to be happening.
*04:19.100- 04:20.920* :  We cannot be like this.
*04:20.920- 04:22.460* :  We cannot condone this.
*04:22.880- 04:27.760* :  The Trump rally, the rally that he should have been able to be conducted peacefully without
*04:27.760- 04:28.480* :  any problem.
*04:29.100- 04:34.740* :  But the idea, the idea that there's political violence or violence in America like this is
*04:34.740- 04:35.680* :  just unheard of.
*04:35.680- 04:39.500* :  It's just not appropriate and everybody must condemn it.
*04:40.120- 04:41.960* :  Now an investigation is underway.
*04:42.440- 04:45.080* :  Kevin Rodgeck is from the FBI office in Pittsburgh.
*04:45.820- 04:50.640* :  We're still working through the security apparatus that the secret service had in place.
*04:51.600- 04:52.500* :  What potentially happened?
*04:52.500- 04:57.300* :  There's going to be a long investigation into exactly what took place and how the individual
*04:57.300- 05:01.260* :  was able to get access to the location, what type of weapon he had.
*05:01.260- 05:05.440* :  All that is really days, weeks and months of investigation.
*05:06.220- 05:10.220* :  The BBC's Jenny Kumar, who's at the scene, told us more about the shooter.
*05:10.920- 05:13.140* :  He's been named as Thomas Matthew Crooks.
*05:13.480- 05:19.480* :  He was 20 and he was from Bethel Park, which is about an hour away from where the shooting
*05:19.480- 05:20.060* :  happened.
*05:20.260- 05:24.020* :  And we understand the police have done a raid on his house.
*05:24.020- 05:25.720* :  There was a no-fly zone over it.
*05:26.280- 05:31.480* :  And also a bit more detail about the fact that he was registered as a Republican voter.
*05:32.260- 05:39.180* :  And though we understand he made a $15 donation to a committee that raises money for left
*05:39.180- 05:45.520* :  leaning and democratic politicians on the day that President Biden was sworn in.
*05:46.080- 05:49.760* :  We know that he graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022.
*05:49.820- 05:56.980* :  This is according to the Pittsburgh Tribune review and he received a $500 star award from
*05:56.980- 05:59.080* :  the National Math and Science Initiative.
*05:59.760- 06:06.920* :  Now his father, Matthew Crooks, who's 53, has told the media outlet CNN he was trying
*06:06.920- 06:12.320* :  to figure out what had happened and he would wait until he spoke to law enforcement before
*06:12.320- 06:13.140* :  saying any more.
*06:13.800- 06:18.160* :  Donald Trump is due at the Republican Convention, which begins in Wisconsin on Monday.
*06:18.620- 06:23.260* :  Just before we recorded this podcast, Mr. Trump posted a statement on his own Truth
*06:23.260- 06:25.240* :  Social Website, his native topic.
*06:25.840- 06:27.960* :  Donald Trump is in New Jersey now.
*06:27.960- 06:33.280* :  He actually got off the plane last night, completely unated, fine.
*06:33.880- 06:36.860* :  His campaign says he is in great spirits.
*06:37.540- 06:42.700* :  The former president himself says he's looking forward to being here in Milwaukee later
*06:42.700- 06:44.880* :  in the week to speak to the nation.
*06:44.880- 06:52.400* :  In that statement that he put out earlier this morning, clearly he is very in tune with
*06:52.400- 06:57.960* :  this being a momentous moment for him in the campaign and wanting to strike the correct
*06:57.960- 06:58.400* :  tone.
*06:58.860- 07:04.260* :  He painted himself as a kind of fighter saying that they will remain resilient and fight.
*07:04.940- 07:09.080* :  And he said that he is appealing for unity at this time.
*07:09.640- 07:14.580* :  But certainly for Donald Trump in that statement saying only got alone could have prevented
*07:14.620- 07:16.160* :  what could have happened there.
*07:16.240- 07:21.740* :  We see in those photographs how closely that bullet went by his ear.
*07:22.180- 07:26.560* :  We saw blood on his face and how he responded to that, telling the Secret Service to wait
*07:26.560- 07:30.460* :  as he took a moment to pump his fists and tell his supporters to fight.
*07:31.000- 07:36.880* :  So certainly we can expect the tone here in Milwaukee to very much reflect what happened
*07:36.880- 07:39.340* :  in Pennsylvania and how Donald Trump has reacted to that.
*07:39.940- 07:45.000* :  The attack has united Democrats and Republicans who condemn the use of violence and who've
*07:45.000- 07:46.860* :  called for more social cohesion.
*07:47.220- 07:50.780* :  Here's the Democratic Congressman Adriana Espelat from New York State.
*07:51.400- 07:57.780* :  The atmosphere has been very charged, very aggressive for a long time, very polarized.
*07:58.740- 08:05.480* :  And unfortunately I don't am not surprised how there's a constant threat of violence even
*08:05.480- 08:06.960* :  throughout the campaign.
*08:06.960- 08:09.880* :  I think that the temper has been very high.
*08:10.580- 08:15.680* :  This action, fortunately, should be one that we reject and don't see happen again.
*08:16.640- 08:20.900* :  And here's Stephen Moore, a senior economic advisor to the Trump campaign.
*08:21.580- 08:24.660* :  It is a divided nation and it's becoming toxic.
*08:24.660- 08:28.660* :  And now look, one shooter doesn't represent the country.
*08:28.660- 08:33.980* :  But I do worry about violence because people are each other's throats about the ideological
*08:33.980- 08:36.520* :  differences that separate our country right now.
*08:37.040- 08:42.340* :  Maybe, you know, this might be in the end a good thing if it can bring everybody together
*08:42.340- 08:43.960* :  and say let's tone it down a little bit.
*08:44.740- 08:49.780* :  We've also been hearing reaction from world leaders with many calling it an attack on democracy.
*08:50.460- 08:52.180* :  Well, Stephanie Prentice is with me.
*08:52.740- 08:53.280* :  What do we heard?
*08:53.420- 08:54.480* :  Who have we heard from so far?
*08:55.120- 08:59.980* :  Well, our condemnation of this attack has united many countries in the sentiment that
*08:59.980- 09:03.140* :  there is no place for violence like this in politics.
*09:03.880- 09:08.720* :  So the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, they were
*09:08.720- 09:13.080* :  two of the first world leaders to offer their prayers and support to Mr Trump.
*09:13.580- 09:16.160* :  We heard from Palestinian President Macmoud Abbas.
*09:16.340- 09:18.820* :  He condemned it as a terrorist act.
*09:19.400- 09:23.460* :  And we've also heard from world leaders, including Ukraine's President Zelensky.
*09:23.760- 09:29.220* :  He said he was appalled at the news and he wrote such violence has no justification
*09:29.220- 09:33.000* :  and no place in the world never should violence prevail.
*09:33.780- 09:38.640* :  Now the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, he said his country stood with the
*09:38.640- 09:41.200* :  United States and we can hear from him now.
*09:41.780- 09:48.760* :  This was an inexcusable attack on the democratic values that Australians and Americans share
*09:49.560- 09:50.960* :  and the freedom that we treasure.
*09:52.100- 10:02.060* :  These values, ones that unite our two countries, it's the basis of our alliance is those shared
*10:02.060- 10:09.500* :  values between our peoples as great democratic nations and all Australians stand with our
*10:09.500- 10:13.160* :  friends in the United States at this difficult time.
*10:14.140- 10:19.140* :  The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy all strongly condemned the attack too.
*10:19.600- 10:24.760* :  Andreas Narendra Modi said he was deeply concerned about his friend and President Xi of
*10:24.760- 10:27.600* :  China has wished Mr Trump a speedy recovery.
*10:28.120- 10:32.340* :  But Stephanie, it's true too, isn't it, that some countries are being accused of using
*10:32.340- 10:34.420* :  this to advance their own agenda?
*10:35.200- 10:39.500* :  Absolutely, so already we've been hearing political commentators discussing the dangers
*10:39.500- 10:42.340* :  of the attack itself being weaponized.
*10:42.840- 10:47.780* :  A spokesman for Russia's President Vladimir Putin has said the Biden government had created
*10:47.780- 10:52.540* :  an atmosphere in their words, around Mr Trump, during the election campaign that made
*10:52.540- 10:55.600* :  this attack possible, here's to meet Trey Peskov.
*10:56.380- 11:02.640* :  The atmosphere that was created by this administration during the political struggle, the atmosphere
*11:02.640- 11:07.920* :  around candidate Trump, it's precisely this that provoked what America is now facing.
*11:08.440- 11:13.000* :  The Kremlin also used the attack to comment on the U.S. support for Ukraine, suggesting
*11:13.000- 11:16.300* :  the American spend public money on police at home.
*11:16.860- 11:22.580* :  And in a similar vein, Argentina's Javier Malay has used social media to blame the international
*11:22.640- 11:24.300* :  left, the assassination attempt.
*11:24.780- 11:29.820* :  He wrote in panic at losing at the polls they resort to terrorism to impose their backward
*11:29.820- 11:31.520* :  and authoritarian agenda.
*11:32.200- 11:32.640* :  Thanks, Steph.
*11:32.960- 11:34.040* :  Stephanie Prentice there.
*11:36.180- 11:39.920* :  Still, to calm in this podcast, we'll always remember where we were and what we're
*11:39.960- 11:40.260* :  doing.
*11:40.540- 11:41.800* :  And this will change our country.
*11:41.800- 11:43.400* :  We just don't know how yet.
*11:43.740- 11:49.320* :  We find out how the attack on President Trump might affect the upcoming presidential election.
*11:57.860- 11:58.600* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*11:58.600- 12:02.540* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.

*12:32.220- 12:34.440* :  We all know what that music means.
*12:34.640- 12:37.440* :  It's time for the Olympics in Paris.
*12:38.100- 12:40.480* :  I'm Matt Rodgers and I'm Bowen Yeh.
*12:40.760- 12:42.460* :  And we're doing an Olympics podcast?
*12:42.460- 12:43.440* :  Uh, yeah.

*13:02.520- 13:03.480* :  you get your podcasts.
*13:09.520- 13:14.460* :  Donald Trump said on his truth social website that he wanted to thank the United States
*13:14.460- 13:17.960* :  Secret Service and law enforcement for their rapid response.
*13:18.320- 13:21.760* :  He said it was incredible that such an act could take place in America.
*13:22.400- 13:24.720* :  But there have been questions raised over security.
*13:24.780- 13:29.820* :  An eyewitness who spoke to the BBC said he tried to tell security for several minutes
*13:29.820- 13:34.660* :  that he could see a sniper on top of a roof just outside the perimeter of the event.
*13:35.380- 13:40.140* :  The most security service member Robert McDonald who led the team that protected Joe Biden
*13:40.140- 13:43.400* :  when he was vice president said he was incredibly surprised.
*13:44.020- 13:49.000* :  I'm very troubled that a citizen who was at the event was able to see that something
*13:49.540- 13:53.960* :  appeared to be not right was taking it upon themselves to pass that information along.
*13:53.960- 13:56.960* :  You know, we work in concentric rings of protection.
*13:57.020- 14:00.080* :  We have an inner ring, a middle ring, and an outer ring.
*14:00.480- 14:02.340* :  Those people were in the outer ring, obviously.
*14:02.340- 14:06.820* :  I can tell you that if that information was passed along properly, the former president
*14:06.820- 14:10.880* :  would have been taken off of the stage and brought to a secure location.
*14:11.680- 14:16.660* :  For more on security at the Pennsylvania rally, the BBC's Paul Henley spoke to Jonathan
*14:16.660- 14:20.120* :  Gilliam, a former FBI agent, and US Navy SEAL.
*14:20.860- 14:29.440* :  There was a failure to freeze an area around that stage that was far enough out that incorporated
*14:29.440- 14:33.120* :  these few buildings that somebody could have gotten on top of.
*14:33.120- 14:35.500* :  That's the first mistake that happened.
*14:35.720- 14:40.800* :  And not only did they not incorporate that, but it appears that law enforcement wasn't
*14:40.800- 14:44.860* :  even aware that the shooter had gotten on top of that building.
*14:45.340- 14:50.520* :  Other individuals that were there just to see Trump from afar, they were there, and
*14:50.520- 14:54.740* :  they hadn't been screened either as far as I can tell because that wasn't in the frozen
*14:54.800- 14:55.060* :  zone.
*14:55.500- 15:00.640* :  Joe suggests that security personnel did have their guns trained on the shooter before
*15:00.640- 15:01.220* :  he fired.
*15:01.640- 15:04.820* :  We know that they were trained in that area.
*15:04.820- 15:10.560* :  We don't know if they were particularly on that shooter because when that video that you're
*15:10.560- 15:16.180* :  speaking of, when the shots rang out, you can see the Seagrard Service agent recoiling
*15:16.180- 15:17.220* :  come off of his site.
*15:17.300- 15:21.160* :  He was stunned by the shot that came out, and then he went back onto the scope.
*15:21.580- 15:28.820* :  I believe it's five rounds were released by the shooter before nine seconds later.
*15:28.820- 15:34.780* :  There was another round which I have to assume most likely was the Seagrard Service shooting
*15:34.780- 15:35.840* :  the attacker.
*15:36.120- 15:41.340* :  That is a lifetime when it comes to responding to an active shooter.
*15:41.700- 15:46.660* :  What kind of circumference around the podium at an event like that would you have swept
*15:46.700- 15:47.560* :  made secure?
*15:47.900- 15:49.820* :  So you do these different rings of security.
*15:49.880- 15:53.020* :  Who could get on with the knife so you're going to have a certain amount of law enforcement
*15:53.020- 15:56.760* :  that's going to be aware in the proximity of that stage.
*15:57.180- 16:01.800* :  Then you think about a pistol, the max effective range of a pistol would be in an environment
*16:01.800- 16:02.260* :  like that.
*16:02.440- 16:05.620* :  If they could secrete it into that area, it would be about 50 yards.
*16:05.620- 16:11.740* :  And then for an AR-15 or an AK-47, in this case, they're saying it was an AR-15, the
*16:11.740- 16:13.740* :  max effective range is 600 yards.
*16:14.520- 16:17.920* :  So 130 yards, that's nothing.
*16:18.200- 16:23.500* :  I mean, that's an easy shot for anyone to take with virtually no experience shooting.
*16:23.960- 16:25.600* :  That should have been taken into account.
*16:26.260- 16:31.180* :  They could have locked those buildings down or that area so that nobody could get in or
*16:31.180- 16:32.220* :  on top of those buildings.
*16:32.220- 16:38.480* :  I would have gone out at least 300 yards and maybe even further depending on the structures
*16:38.480- 16:39.580* :  that were around there.
*16:39.880- 16:45.180* :  Have you gone to opinion on whether Donald Trump has the right size of security detail
*16:45.180- 16:46.200* :  for an ex-president?
*16:46.720- 16:47.260* :  I don't think so.
*16:47.300- 16:48.580* :  I mean, I think that's evidently clear.
*16:48.580- 16:52.640* :  Again, we can look at what occurred and we can say, no, they don't have, and again,
*16:52.640- 16:54.840* :  secret service works with local law enforcement.
*16:54.840- 17:00.560* :  So they can always draw on those extra numbers to support them and help with the perimeter
*17:00.560- 17:01.740* :  or the convoy.
*17:02.240- 17:07.480* :  But in this case, either they didn't have enough counter snipers or they just didn't
*17:07.840- 17:10.000* :  sweep that area and put law enforcement out there.
*17:10.000- 17:12.780* :  They was either incompetent or they just didn't have the numbers.
*17:13.400- 17:19.140* :  So when we say the size, I'm not just talking about the numbers, I'm talking about the size
*17:19.140- 17:19.820* :  of the people.
*17:20.300- 17:24.480* :  You should put tall people that are protecting a tall person.
*17:24.860- 17:28.340* :  As you can see in the video, there's a female standing in front of him.
*17:28.680- 17:30.960* :  She's not even tall enough to get to his shoulders.
*17:31.540- 17:38.100* :  So his entire head was exposed from one side because that protector, that secret service
*17:38.100- 17:40.780* :  agent was not the right physical size.
*17:40.860- 17:43.440* :  Basically, they are body armor.
*17:43.440- 17:46.960* :  They're living body armor and that was a failure.
*17:47.220- 17:50.680* :  Politicians want to be seen to be close to the people literally.
*17:51.040- 17:54.580* :  How much of a problem does that pose for security protocol?
*17:54.900- 17:58.740* :  When we look at what's occurred, I mean, these numerous assassination attempts that have
*17:58.740- 18:03.340* :  happened around the world and in the case of Mexico where numerous politicians have been
*18:03.340- 18:10.280* :  killed recently, we're talking this year, the protect these have to understand there's
*18:10.280- 18:14.300* :  a happy medium between this and I don't feel like that's being met.
*18:14.300- 18:19.440* :  When you look at the podium that Trump was standing behind, that is clearly not bullet proof.
*18:19.940- 18:20.920* :  Why aren't things like that?
*18:20.960- 18:27.060* :  The size of the podium and making that a ballistic shield, why isn't that being taken into
*18:27.060- 18:27.420* :  account?
*18:28.200- 18:32.620* :  That itself wouldn't have stopped this one going at his head, but what if there was one
*18:32.620- 18:34.760* :  that was lower, that could have stopped around.
*18:35.320- 18:40.620* :  These are simple things that need to be looked at and the protect you themselves and I will
*18:40.620- 18:45.940* :  give Donald Trump this one criticism in this is that they have to drill into the head of
*18:45.940- 18:52.740* :  these protect these that when something occurs, we have to move you and we can't take
*18:52.740- 18:57.900* :  time to stop and have a photo op because they don't know how many times he's been shot.
*18:57.940- 19:02.460* :  They don't know if there's more than one shooter and if they're going to move them, they
*19:02.460- 19:03.200* :  have to move him.
*19:03.300- 19:04.480* :  He has to get out of there.
*19:04.900- 19:09.780* :  So you think that moment after he was shot when Donald Trump was pumping the air with
*19:09.780- 19:13.920* :  his fist, you call that a photo op and you think he should have been simply out of sight
*19:13.920- 19:14.240* :  then.
*19:14.540- 19:15.300* :  He should have been gone.
*19:15.560- 19:19.960* :  He's a strong person and he's got a warrior mentality to stand up and do that.
*19:20.380- 19:27.260* :  But if I was in charge of that detail, he would have been yanked off that stage so fast
*19:27.440- 19:30.980* :  and so aggressively, he wouldn't have had time to even stand up.
*19:31.280- 19:32.620* :  He would have been off that stage.
*19:33.260- 19:36.840* :  She expert and former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam.
*19:37.800- 19:42.540* :  What happened in Pennsylvania on Saturday is bind have an impact on the election campaign
*19:42.940- 19:44.400* :  in the run up to the vote in November.
*19:44.980- 19:50.000* :  Questions being asked include will Donald Trump benefit and will it increase the pressure
*19:50.000- 19:52.900* :  from Democrats on Joe Biden to step down?
*19:53.560- 19:58.700* :  Paul Henley spoke to Matt Gorman, the Republican strategist and to Democrat strategist Mary
*19:58.700- 19:59.180* :  Ann Marsh.
*20:00.260- 20:05.600* :  I was watching it live and it was a it was a scary moment and it's one of those where
*20:05.600- 20:09.540* :  we'll always remember where we were and what we're doing and this will change our country.
*20:09.940- 20:11.220* :  We just don't know how yet.
*20:11.900- 20:18.120* :  And I think in the short term, this we will certainly see that image of President Trump
*20:18.120- 20:21.560* :  everywhere in Milwaukee at the Republican convention in the long term.
*20:22.220- 20:25.680* :  We're uncertain how this will change the campaign, but it certainly will.
*20:26.440- 20:31.960* :  Mary Ann, the Biden administration has been very swift with total condemnation.
*20:32.540- 20:35.460* :  How should it deal with this, though, as the campaign progresses?
*20:36.040- 20:41.680* :  The Biden administration and the Biden campaign starting last night took down everything virtually
*20:41.680- 20:44.400* :  stopped their entire campaign for president.
*20:44.520- 20:49.780* :  They took down all of their political ads, stopped all political communications, no email
*20:49.780- 20:53.200* :  solicitations, no fundraising solicitations, everything has stopped.
*20:53.560- 20:54.920* :  And that is the right thing to do.
*20:55.460- 21:01.320* :  So I think what we have an opportunity to do, however, is to reset the campaign, reset
*21:01.320- 21:02.360* :  the tone and tenor.
*21:02.760- 21:07.320* :  As Matt pointed out, the Republican National Convention starts tomorrow in Milwaukee.
*21:08.300- 21:12.740* :  Everyone has an opportunity there and across the country, elected officials, opinion leaders
*21:12.740- 21:18.680* :  and others to take note of this attack, condemn this attack, violence is never the answer.
*21:18.680- 21:20.320* :  It should always be condemned.
*21:20.840- 21:22.780* :  And I think that's a very important thing to do.
*21:23.140- 21:28.240* :  I think on the Democratic side, which is most interesting is this may end the attempt
*21:28.240- 21:31.880* :  to get Joe Biden to step aside and not run for reelection.
*21:31.880- 21:33.000* :  Why would it do that?
*21:33.840- 21:39.700* :  We're in a time of political turmoil and tumult certainly with the attack on Donald Trump
*21:39.700- 21:43.580* :  last night and we're all grateful that he's survived that and will be fine.
*21:44.420- 21:50.400* :  But I think to go after the sitting president and continue the pressure campaign to get
*21:50.400- 21:55.720* :  him step aside, may really contribute to even more uncertainty and more tumult.
*21:56.120- 21:59.180* :  We will see how this all works out like Matt, you know, I agree.
*21:59.180- 22:05.000* :  We don't really know, but it is an opportunity for everyone to be a leader to change the tone,
*22:05.000- 22:12.140* :  change the tenor, words matter, condemn this action and try to have a more positive policy-based
*22:12.140- 22:14.760* :  discussion and debate for the election in November.
*22:14.920- 22:20.260* :  Matt, so it is possible that the tension might come down in this campaign and there could
*22:20.260- 22:26.760* :  be more agreement across the political divide, but Donald Trump could benefit.
*22:26.760- 22:28.580* :  Can we be bold about this?
*22:28.580- 22:33.020* :  Donald Trump could benefit in the campaign and in popularity from what's happened.
*22:33.020- 22:38.920* :  He probably grasps that when he puts on social media today, God alone has prevented the
*22:38.920- 22:39.920* :  unthinkable happening.
*22:40.340- 22:41.340* :  He's saying he's saved.
*22:42.160- 22:45.720* :  Yeah, I mean, I think that was a, I saw a statement this morning and I thought it was
*22:45.720- 22:51.000* :  to hit the exact right note, calling for unity, talking about his faith.
*22:51.000- 22:55.620* :  I thought that it was the exact right thing to say and at the right time, I think I would
*22:55.620- 23:00.580* :  expect him to continue that over the next couple of days as we hit in the convention as
*23:00.620- 23:00.820* :  well.
*23:01.420- 23:03.600* :  You know, look, I actually drew Marianne entirely.
*23:03.600- 23:08.240* :  I think it is far less likely that Joe Biden stepped aside than it was yesterday at this
*23:08.240- 23:13.420* :  time and certainly that it was a week ago at this time for even just a, even more cynical
*23:13.420- 23:13.660* :  way.
*23:14.160- 23:18.280* :  This, you know, certainly gets the struggles with Joe Biden, the Democratic Party off the
*23:18.340- 23:18.880* :  front page.
*23:19.240- 23:22.580* :  Earlier in the day, there was, you know, some tense conference calls among Democrats.
*23:23.220- 23:26.920* :  This gets it off the front pages and for quite a bit now.
*23:27.220- 23:31.880* :  But might there be voters who come round to Mr. Trump in the wake of what's happened?
*23:32.080- 23:37.260* :  People perhaps Republican supporters who weren't keen on Mr. Trump personally, but admire
*23:37.260- 23:38.960* :  his resilience and bravery now.
*23:40.040- 23:40.460* :  Possibly.
*23:40.700- 23:45.560* :  Look, I could, I could expect him to see a bump and I think between this and the Republican
*23:45.900- 23:50.420* :  national convention, which there tends to be a bump in the polling after your respective
*23:50.420- 23:52.220* :  party's convention, absolutely.
*23:52.860- 23:58.940* :  But this will tend to even out, I bet, by, you know, by the month's end or certainly
*23:58.940- 23:59.700* :  by election day.
*24:01.280- 24:07.340* :  Your assertion, Marianne, that this could end the debate over whether Mr. Biden steps down.
*24:07.340- 24:13.120* :  I mean, it could certainly rule out any debate in the very few coming days.
*24:13.120- 24:16.520* :  It's unlikely to put a stop to it in the, in the medium term, is it?
*24:17.220- 24:22.960* :  Well, I think President Biden has shown that he's really dug in on, on running for
*24:22.960- 24:23.480* :  re-election.
*24:23.640- 24:27.860* :  And I assume that that may have gotten even stronger in the wake of this.
*24:28.420- 24:30.000* :  But I would want to go back to one thing.
*24:30.000- 24:34.660* :  I think everyone has an opportunity here, Democrats and Republicans, to model good behavior.
*24:35.040- 24:39.620* :  Joe Biden called Donald Trump last night, not once but twice, to talk to him, check in
*24:39.620- 24:41.200* :  on him, see how he was doing.
*24:41.200- 24:42.780* :  That is the right thing to do.
*24:43.200- 24:44.560* :  And they are fierce competitors.
*24:44.640- 24:48.000* :  But to Matt's point, this has been a very stubborn race.
*24:48.000- 24:53.280* :  It has been as tight as you can imagine, all within one, two, three points of each other
*24:53.680- 24:54.700* :  throughout this whole race.
*24:55.180- 25:00.700* :  So what I think we should all hope for is if you are an elected official or a public
*25:00.700- 25:03.640* :  opinion leader with a title, model better behavior.
*25:04.100- 25:05.580* :  Watch your words carefully.
*25:06.020- 25:12.140* :  And I think Joe Biden in the wake of this attack on his rival showed exactly one of the ways
*25:12.140- 25:14.700* :  we can all go forward and we should all learn from that.
*25:14.820- 25:19.180* :  Matt, Donald Trump has clearly used inflammatory language in the past.
*25:19.200- 25:23.300* :  Is it a given that he won't be using it any more during the rest of this campaign?
*25:23.760- 25:26.520* :  Language that could be seen to be inciting violence, I mean.
*25:27.200- 25:30.400* :  I can't look into the future, but you know, this is a moment where we can, you know,
*25:30.560- 25:34.860* :  rule the temperature a little bit and hopefully kind of come together.
*25:35.500- 25:39.340* :  I think that could be something that comes out of this.
*25:39.780- 25:42.400* :  And Donald Trump will be at the event tomorrow, will he?
*25:42.920- 25:43.640* :  He should be.
*25:44.420- 25:48.620* :  Many people are expecting him to come out with his vice presidential pick during the convention
*25:48.680- 25:49.380* :  in the evening.
*25:49.940- 25:52.240* :  And then he will, of course, be gone Thursday night.
*25:52.800- 25:57.800* :  Republican strategist Matt Gorman and Democratic strategist Mary Ann Marsh.
*25:59.580- 26:02.580* :  That's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*26:02.580- 26:03.020* :  later.

*26:20.420- 26:22.380* :  I'm Valerie Sounderson, until next time, bye-bye.
*26:30.580- 26:37.020* :  We all know what that music means.
*26:37.500- 26:40.000* :  It's time for the Olympics in Paris.
*26:40.660- 26:42.800* :  I'm Matt Rogers, and I'm Bowen Yeh.
*26:43.320- 26:45.020* :  And we're doing an Olympics podcast?
