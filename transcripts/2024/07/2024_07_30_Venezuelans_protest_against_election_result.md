*01:25.280- 01:27.640* :  I'm Rachel Wright and in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:27.640- 01:33.460* :  the 30th of July, these are our main stories. President Nicholas Maduro of Venezuela has
*01:33.460- 01:38.340* :  accused his opponents of trying to mount a coup as large crowds take to the streets to
*01:38.340- 01:43.520* :  announce his re-election as fraudulent. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
*01:43.520- 01:48.660* :  faced cheers from crowds on a visit to the scene of a deadly rocket strike in the occupied
*01:48.660- 01:55.600* :  Golan Heights. On day three of the Paris Olympics, Ukraine has won its first medal and a 17-year-old
*01:55.600- 02:05.500* :  Canadian swimmer has taken her second. Also in this podcast, Jonathan Clothier. This graduation
*02:05.500- 02:12.520* :  was a long time coming. Johnny Clothier, who's now 62, lined up alongside those in their 20s
*02:12.560- 02:17.560* :  at the University of Bristol. At last, a British man graduates after many years,
*02:17.940- 02:20.660* :  all because a parrot ruffled a few feathers.
*02:24.960- 02:27.600* :  We begin in Venezuela's capital, Caracas.
*02:33.720- 02:37.780* :  Where security forces have used tear gas against crowds protesting against
*02:37.780- 02:43.040* :  Nicholas Maduro's presidential election victory, although Mr. Maduro has been officially
*02:43.040- 02:49.280* :  declared the winner, the opposition has rejected the outcome as fraudulent. He is responded by
*02:49.280- 02:54.460* :  accusing the opposition of trying to stage a coup. A number of countries, including the US
*02:54.460- 03:00.580* :  Brazil and Spain, have demanded transparency over the vote count, and nine Latin American nations
*03:00.580- 03:06.420* :  have requested an emergency meeting of the organization of American states to discuss the results.
*03:07.080- 03:12.460* :  Our South American correspondent Ioni Wells is in Caracas and gave this assessment of the day's
*03:12.460- 03:18.760* :  events. In Caracas, thousands of people have started walking towards the presidential palace
*03:18.760- 03:24.580* :  to protest the disputed election results. There have been people on the streets and in their homes
*03:24.580- 03:30.400* :  banging pots and pans in protest against the results that President Maduro and his government
*03:30.400- 03:36.120* :  and Electoral Council announced on Sunday night after the presidential election. I spoke to
*03:36.120- 03:40.740* :  some people on the streets who were out protesting, not deterred by the huge thunderstorm that was
*03:40.740- 03:45.360* :  taking place in the city at the time. And when I asked them why they were protesting and what they
*03:45.360- 03:50.160* :  made of the result that had been announced, they said quite bluntly they believed it was a fraud.
*03:50.160- 03:55.880* :  And they said that President Maduro had no right to be in power. They said that they and loads of
*03:55.880- 04:00.520* :  others that they knew had all turned out to vote for change, that they believed that was necessary
*04:00.520- 04:05.780* :  for the country, that they needed better economy, better employment, better opportunities for
*04:05.780- 04:11.820* :  young people. Those voices of protest are growing. There are, as I say, thousands of people
*04:11.820- 04:17.580* :  descending on the presidential palace to protest this results. President Maduro himself has accused
*04:17.580- 04:23.280* :  the opposition of trying to instigate a attempted coup by disputing the results of this election.
*04:23.280- 04:27.920* :  But it isn't just the opposition who are disputing the results. There is a growing number of
*04:27.920- 04:33.580* :  governments abroad who are refusing to recognize the results of this election unless the government
*04:33.580- 04:36.680* :  can provide proof of the numbers that they published overnight.
*04:37.260- 04:42.100* :  Iony Wells in Venezuela. Next, to the Middle East, Israel's Prime Minister,
*04:42.100- 04:47.420* :  Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to give a severe response to Saturday's strike on the Israeli
*04:47.420- 04:54.180* :  occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 young people. Israel blames Hezbollah and accusation denied
*04:54.180- 05:00.540* :  by the group. As Mr Netanyahu visited the site of the attack in Majda Shams, protesters gathered
*05:00.540- 05:06.580* :  outside the building he was in, shouting out, and BB is an assassin, angry that not enough has
*05:06.580- 05:10.220* :  been done to protect the mainly Druze area from such strikes.
*05:16.820- 05:22.360* :  Surrounded by leaders of the Druze community, Mr Netanyahu said Israel would retaliate.
*05:24.620- 05:28.900* :  We are embracing the families who are going through indescribable suffering.
*05:29.020- 05:35.080* :  These children are our children, they are the children of us all. The state of Israel cannot
*05:35.080- 05:40.260* :  and will not let it pass. Our response will come and it will be severe.
*05:41.260- 05:46.900* :  Theas of a large-scale Israeli retaliation in Lebanon have grown. Germany, Britain and the
*05:46.900- 05:51.680* :  Netherlands have called on their citizens to leave Lebanon urgently. Several international
*05:51.720- 05:56.860* :  airlines, including Air France and Lufthansa, have suspended flights to the capital Beirut.
*05:57.440- 06:02.760* :  So how likely is it that Israel will retaliate? A question for a correspondent in Jerusalem,
*06:02.760- 06:08.120* :  Mark Loen. I think the expectation is that there will be a retaliation, possibly quite soon.
*06:08.120- 06:15.380* :  We actually expected something last night, overnight Sunday into Monday, but there was a strike
*06:15.380- 06:20.400* :  which was fairly limited in scope, a drone strike in southern Lebanon that killed two Hezbollah
*06:20.400- 06:25.740* :  fighters and injured three others. But Benjamin Netanyahu is under pressure to hit back hard,
*06:25.740- 06:31.480* :  partly from within his coalition, from far-right ministers within the coalition who want a strong
*06:31.480- 06:38.140* :  retaliation. And partly also from people who have been evacuated from the north of Israel,
*06:38.140- 06:43.700* :  60,000 people have been evacuated in recent months because of the continual cross-border fire
*06:43.700- 06:50.880* :  with Hezbollah. And there is a desire to deal decisively with the militant group. But that said,
*06:50.880- 06:55.680* :  there is also so much pressure on both sides not to escalate this into all-out war.
*06:56.180- 07:01.680* :  And there are some reports that Israel intends to hit back, but in a limited way,
*07:01.680- 07:07.920* :  so as not to bring the situation to an all-out escalation. And of course, we still have the ongoing
*07:07.920- 07:14.460* :  situation between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. How is this likely to affect any kind of truth
*07:14.460- 07:19.800* :  that could happen there? Well, we were getting to a point where there was sort of soundings coming
*07:19.800- 07:26.220* :  from Washington that a cease-fire deal was drawing closer, although Benjamin Netanyahu's government
*07:26.220- 07:32.420* :  had been placing additional demands on Hamas for a cease-fire and critics were claiming that he
*07:32.420- 07:37.700* :  was basically stringing out this war for his own political survival because when the guns for
*07:37.700- 07:44.200* :  silent in Gaza were eventually his political career could end. So the two fronts of this war
*07:44.200- 07:50.280* :  are intrinsically linked, of course. And the pressure from Washington on Israel is increasing
*07:50.280- 07:55.280* :  because they know that actually a cease-fire in Gaza is unlikely to happen while the tension
*07:55.280- 08:01.500* :  on the northern border with Hezbollah increases. Also, Israel's military is stretched in Gaza,
*08:01.780- 08:05.920* :  you know, munitions are running low. So Israel is going to want to really open up a second
*08:05.920- 08:11.920* :  military front while the fighting in Gaza continues. So it's a hugely complex picture and a hugely
*08:11.920- 08:17.300* :  dangerous moment for this region. Mark Lohan in Jerusalem. As we just heard, the attack on
*08:17.300- 08:23.080* :  Majd al-Shams in the Golan Heights was in an area inhabited by members of the Druze community.
*08:23.520- 08:28.080* :  The history of the area and of the people who live there is quite complex as our correspondent
*08:28.080- 08:34.600* :  in Jerusalem, Paul Adams explains. In 1967, when Israel fought and won the Six-Day War against
*08:34.600- 08:40.720* :  its Arab neighbours, it captured several key bits of territory. The Sinai Peninsula and Gaza
*08:40.720- 08:46.520* :  strip from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.
*08:47.380- 08:53.640* :  Around 130,000 Syrians fled or were driven from their homes on the Golan, but those who remained
*08:53.640- 08:59.800* :  were almost all members of an Arab minority known as the Druze. Their religion has its origins
*08:59.800- 09:07.360* :  in Islam but is quite distinct. Until 1967, they were citizens of Syria. Now suddenly they found
*09:07.360- 09:13.220* :  themselves living under Israeli rule. The Golan Heights, a rocky plateau which rises up north
*09:13.220- 09:19.920* :  and east of the Sea of Galilee, was now Israeli-occupied territory. In 1981, the government of Israel
*09:19.920- 09:25.580* :  passed a law which basically annexed the whole area. Up till now, only the United States,
*09:25.580- 09:31.620* :  under Donald Trump, has recognised Israel's sovereignty over the Golan. As for the Druze,
*09:31.620- 09:36.700* :  they had the chance to become Israeli citizens. Over the years, some have taken it,
*09:37.020- 09:43.760* :  but only around 20%. Others, even now, still think of themselves as Syrian. They speak Arabic and
*09:43.760- 09:49.800* :  Hebrew equally fluently, but mostly they see themselves as Druze, part of a wider community that
*09:49.800- 09:56.040* :  still exists elsewhere in Israel, in other parts of Syria, and also in Lebanon. And this is the
*09:56.040- 10:01.220* :  identity they're most proud of. When I asked Hussam, a young man I met in Magdol Shams,
*10:01.220- 10:06.580* :  about his identity, he said simply, we see ourselves as the people of the Golan Heights.
*10:06.580- 10:12.620* :  It doesn't matter what our passports say. Now the Druze find themselves caught in the ongoing
*10:12.620- 10:18.780* :  conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The rocket strike which killed 12 young people was shocking
*10:18.780- 10:24.780* :  and deeply painful. The Druze don't want to be part of this war. They just want to live in peace
*10:24.780- 10:30.560* :  at home on the Golan Heights. Paul Adams. In the last six months in power,
*10:30.560- 10:35.980* :  US President Joe Biden has outlined ambitious plans to reform the conservative dominated
*10:35.980- 10:42.220* :  Supreme Court. Mr. Biden says they will restore trust and accountability for the nine justices.
*10:42.720- 10:47.440* :  They include a term limit and overturning the recent ruling which gives Donald Trump
*10:47.440- 10:53.400* :  presidential immunity. He spoke about that ruling at an event on Monday in Austin, Texas.
*10:54.320- 10:59.420* :  The most recently and most shockingly, the Supreme Court established in Trump versus the United
*10:59.420- 11:06.640* :  States a dangerous precedent. They ruled, as you know, that the President of the United States has
*11:06.640- 11:15.260* :  immunity for potential crimes he may have committed while in office immunity. This nation was
*11:15.260- 11:20.600* :  found another principle. There are no kings in America. Each of us would equal before the war.
*11:24.280- 11:29.760* :  No one is above the law. They're all practical purposes. The court's decision almost certainly
*11:29.760- 11:35.720* :  means that the President can violate the oath, flout our laws and face no consequences.
*11:36.660- 11:41.400* :  Mr. Biden's proposals face little chance of getting through the deeply divided Congress.
*11:41.960- 11:47.300* :  Rebecca Kesby spoke to our correspondent, Will Grant, who's in Washington and asked him for more
*11:47.300- 11:53.760* :  on President Biden's comments. Writing in the Washington Post, President Biden set out three key
*11:53.760- 11:59.960* :  reforms to what he said would restore trust and accountability to the court. First of those is
*11:59.960- 12:04.660* :  a constitutional amendment that he's calling the no one above the law amendment. Specifically,
*12:04.660- 12:10.800* :  he says that that would include the line that the Constitution does not confer any immunity from
*12:10.800- 12:16.080* :  federal criminal indictment, trial, conviction or sentencing by virtue of having previously served
*12:16.380- 12:21.820* :  as President to reference their clearly to the decision six to three in favor of a broad
*12:21.820- 12:28.820* :  interpretation of presidential immunity laws. Second term limits for Supreme Court justices.
*12:28.820- 12:32.900* :  There would be a Supreme Court justice chosen every two years by the President,
*12:32.900- 12:39.180* :  only able to serve up to 18 years and third a code of conduct for Supreme Court justices.
*12:39.180- 12:43.920* :  That's a reference to the fact there have been these various scandals about gifts and about
*12:43.920- 12:48.600* :  certain perks that have been given by friends and associates that have caused such controversy
*12:48.600- 12:54.080* :  here in the United States. But well, given that Congress is so divided at the moment,
*12:54.200- 12:59.060* :  isn't it? Is there any chance that he can get these reforms through Congress?
*12:59.060- 13:04.980* :  And would there be an alternative route? I think very little, as things stand, all the proposals
*13:04.980- 13:11.020* :  require 60 votes to pass the Senate. Well, in the current setup, Democrats only hold 51 in that
*13:11.020- 13:17.640* :  chamber. A constitutional amendment requires even more two-thirds support for both houses,
*13:18.200- 13:23.560* :  so it really does look very, very tough when particularly when we take into account comments
*13:23.560- 13:28.620* :  made by Senator Lindsey Graham recently who really made it clear that he had no intention of
*13:28.620- 13:34.240* :  supporting the President on this. I can't see there being any cross-party kind of planning or
*13:34.240- 13:40.440* :  any cross-party support, or certainly not enough for him to get it through in the current state,
*13:40.440- 13:45.300* :  whether or not there is a watered-down version that he's prepared to give a little, take a little
*13:45.300- 13:49.760* :  that kind of a thing. We'll have to see, but in its current form, I think it looks very, very unlikely.
*13:50.380- 13:58.640* :  Well-grant in Washington. Still to come. Food wasn't jetting in and they were starting to go hungry
*13:58.640- 14:04.860* :  and they were resorting to quite, you know, difficult choices. For example, pets will be eaten.
*14:05.380- 14:10.400* :  With millions of people in Sudan facing a looming famine, we hear from the so-called
*14:10.400- 14:14.800* :  Khartoum aid kitchen that's providing meals for 20,000 people.
*14:23.160- 14:28.060* :  Millions of people have lost weight with personalized plans for noon, like Evan, who can't stand
*14:28.060- 14:33.720* :  salads and still lost 50 pounds. Salads generally for most people are the easy-button, right?
*14:33.740- 14:39.500* :  For me, that wasn't an option. I've never really was a salad guy. That's just not who I am,
*14:39.740- 14:44.060* :  but new work for me. Get your personalized plan today at noon.com.

*14:54.180- 14:58.800* :  I guess, my hundreds mid-commercial. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

*15:28.460- 15:33.100* :  details. South Africa's former president, Jacob Zuma, has been expelled from the ruling African
*15:33.100- 15:39.360* :  National Congress party. In January, he was suspended after backing and then leading a new rival
*15:39.360- 15:45.020* :  party. It dented the ANC's share of the vote in the May elections, preventing it from getting
*15:45.020- 15:52.280* :  a majority in parliament. The ANC's secretary general, Fikaily Embalula, said Mr. Zuma's conduct
*15:52.280- 15:59.760* :  was irreconcilable with the ANC constitution. Former president, Jacob Zuma, has actively
*15:59.760- 16:07.400* :  impugned the integrity of the ANC and campaign to dislodge the ANC from power, while claiming
*16:07.400- 16:14.780* :  that yet not se afraid is membership. Furthermore, former president Zuma has been running on a
*16:14.780- 16:24.740* :  dangerous platform that cast doubt on our entire constitutional edifice. So was Jacob Zuma's
*16:24.740- 16:31.020* :  expulsion inevitable? A question for our correspondent, Shingai Nyoka. It was a foregone conclusion
*16:31.020- 16:38.740* :  that this is the decision that the ANC disciplinary committee would arrive at. And so the discipline
*16:38.740- 16:45.500* :  in a hearing was held last week. It was just a day conducted virtually. And today we heard
*16:45.500- 16:52.500* :  those results that essentially they found that he violated the party constitution. He had been
*16:52.500- 16:58.300* :  charged with a two counts of misconduct and he was found guilty on both of those accounts.
*16:58.740- 17:04.540* :  They said that he prejudiced the reputation of the ANC by working with another party.
*17:05.160- 17:09.920* :  You know, a lot of people thought it was quite bizarre that in December 16th last year,
*17:09.920- 17:15.080* :  Jacob Zuma stood up on the platform of the formation of another party in Konto,
*17:15.080- 17:20.700* :  Sizui, and declared that he would be voting against the ANC and that he'd be campaigning against
*17:20.700- 17:27.180* :  them. And so this really has been a six months of a process that people really knew would end with
*17:27.180- 17:33.640* :  him being expelled. Now, as you say, he stood on a platform with the MK party who are the official
*17:33.640- 17:39.700* :  opposition now. But Jacob Zuma himself cannot be an MP. Tell us about that. Why can't he?
*17:39.700- 17:45.180* :  And what do you think is going to happen to him now? Well, Jacob Zuma cannot be a member of parliament
*17:45.180- 17:53.660* :  because he has a criminal conviction, unrelated conviction, where he was found guilty of contempt of
*17:53.660- 17:59.740* :  court. He was sentenced to 15 months. He wouldn't be eligible to be a member of parliament until
*17:59.740- 18:06.620* :  the next elections. And so what happens to Jacob Zuma now? He has 21 days to appeal. And
*18:06.620- 18:13.420* :  if he's a MK party representative said that this was a can go report that he was punished and
*18:13.420- 18:19.800* :  sentenced in his absence, Jacob Zuma had wanted that these hearings be held in public.
*18:20.040- 18:25.520* :  And of course, the ANC got their worst result in 30 years in the recent elections.
*18:26.220- 18:31.680* :  How does it leave them? Do you think this will be a good thing for the ANC that they've finally
*18:31.680- 18:37.540* :  expelled him? Well, I think the damage was already done. And as you mentioned, the ANC
*18:38.520- 18:46.260* :  was handed its worst defeat in its 30 years in power. It received about 40% of the vote.
*18:46.260- 18:52.720* :  Jacob Zuma's MK party got about 15% of the votes. I think the ANC really looks at this as an
*18:52.720- 18:59.420* :  opportunity to purge what it calls the extremist right-wing people within its party, those that are
*18:59.420- 19:06.240* :  allied to Jacob Zuma and an opportunity to rebuild and renew the ANC. Shinghai Nyokha.
*19:07.000- 19:11.960* :  Next to Sudan, where the Sudanese army has been fighting against the paramilitary group,
*19:11.960- 19:16.960* :  the rapid support forces since April last year, plunging the country into chaos.
*19:17.580- 19:23.580* :  It's already the world's worst humanitarian crisis and millions of people face a looming famine.
*19:24.280- 19:29.600* :  Sudanese-run age groups have been crucial in warding off the worst for now. One of them
*19:29.600- 19:35.460* :  is called the Khartoum Aid Kitchen, and it provides meals for 20,000 people in and around the
*19:35.460- 19:41.520* :  Sudanese capital. The organisation kindly sent us some audio clips about their work to bring
*19:41.520- 19:45.560* :  what they're facing to the world. The BBC's James Cotnell reports.
*19:50.440- 19:56.500* :  Food kitchen volunteers sing a sufi spiritual song as they sort through farther beans for the meal
*19:56.500- 20:03.080* :  they're preparing. For many, it will be the only time they eat all day. One of the volunteers
*20:03.080- 20:10.040* :  is so malnourished he has started to lose his sight. At this food kitchen, near an army basin
*20:10.080- 20:16.560* :  and fitihab in undermen and a siege by the rapid support forces, people are only just clinging on
*20:16.560- 20:23.300* :  to life. Mahanid El Balal, one of the founders of Khartoum Aid Kitchen, explains what happens next.
*20:24.260- 20:29.400* :  Food wasn't getting in and they were starting to go hungry and they were resorting to quite
*20:30.040- 20:35.940* :  you know, difficult choices. For example, pets were being eaten so it's cats and so on so it's
*20:36.200- 20:42.060* :  a horrific situation that no one ever wants to be in. People dying of hunger? Yes, yeah,
*20:42.060- 20:47.760* :  people were dying of hunger, especially the elderly. The siege sampling now is broken and after
*20:47.760- 20:54.100* :  that we were as Khartoum Aid Kitchen and other groups were able to get in and get some aid and
*20:54.460- 20:58.700* :  now the situation is better there, but what they lived through was a little help.
*21:00.520- 21:04.220* :  This gunfire is a daily soundtrack for so many in Sudan, a
*21:04.220- 21:10.680* :  percussive, destructive reminder of the danger all around. Reem, a young medical graduate,
*21:11.220- 21:17.420* :  is one of many whose life was changed forever by the fighting. Her story starts as she and her
*21:17.420- 21:25.780* :  family fled. As we were driving away from the checkpoint, the militia man decided to open
*21:26.520- 21:36.040* :  fire, a belt went through the car and into my side nearly missing making.
*21:38.040- 21:45.260* :  I don't know why they decided to shoot at our car after a dream to letting us go.
*21:45.700- 21:49.860* :  It was too dangerous to get to a hospital, but Reem did make a full recovery.
*21:50.760- 21:54.660* :  Now she's a volunteer helping to get medicines to those who need them.
*21:58.080- 22:03.520* :  A long line of people queue up for some bread and some stew under the oppressive Sudanese heat.
*22:04.380- 22:09.780* :  These food kitchens, which are keeping so many people alive, are largely funded by Sudanese
*22:10.120- 22:14.380* :  in exile and at home, all giving what they can as famine looms.
*22:15.360- 22:20.360* :  Mahanid El-Balal from Khatoum A kitchen told me about one person he won't forget,
*22:20.460- 22:26.360* :  a Syrian woman who fled the war in her own country only to meet another conflict in Sudan.
*22:26.360- 22:32.340* :  Now you have the situation of actually not only just living with shells forwarding near your
*22:32.340- 22:38.080* :  house and so on, living through hunger. I imagine it's a very difficult situation for someone
*22:38.520- 22:42.940* :  to have to go through something like this twice. And that will apply not just to that Syrian
*22:42.940- 22:47.720* :  woman, but maybe people who've fed from Darfur or the Nougat mountains where there's been
*22:47.720- 22:54.300* :  other conflicts in Sudan. South Sudanese who've come to Sudan seeking refuge and are fleeing once more.
*22:55.200- 23:01.480* :  Yeah, yeah, it is a hotspot. So there was refugees from Tigray, refugees from South Sudan.
*23:01.500- 23:08.760* :  Then they found themselves in the middle of a war without the support network that maybe a lot
*23:08.760- 23:12.080* :  of Sudanese may already have. And these are some of the most vulnerable groups.
*23:12.100- 23:16.820* :  And in fact, in some of our kitchens, we do have a lot of South Sudanese.
*23:19.680- 23:25.280* :  Back in the food kitchen in El-Fitahab, they're still singing anything to keep their spirits up.
*23:26.300- 23:32.320* :  Right now, in many parts of Sudan, faith, solidarity and of course those food kitchens
*23:33.040- 23:35.240* :  are about the only things keeping people going.
*23:37.340- 23:43.020* :  That report by James Coppnell. In Northern England, two children have been killed and
*23:43.020- 23:47.560* :  nine more have been injured. Six of them critically in a stabbing at a dance class.
*23:48.200- 23:52.820* :  Police in South Port near Liverpool say two adults who are trying to protect the children
*23:53.180- 23:56.580* :  have also been critically injured. Nick Garnett reports.
*23:56.580- 24:02.180* :  The beginning of the school holidays, a dance and yoga event for primary school children most
*24:02.180- 24:06.780* :  of whom were young girls to tailor swift songs. No wonder it was fully booked.
*24:07.420- 24:11.400* :  At 10 to 12, just before it was due to end, someone walked in and attacked.
*24:12.080- 24:15.160* :  People who were nearby say he got out of a taxi and refused to pay.
*24:15.780- 24:18.880* :  Colin Perry works in a building opposite from where the dance class took place.
*24:19.520- 24:24.100* :  They were screaming, said it's not the normal scream when kids are playing somewhere.
*24:24.480- 24:30.180* :  I called the police, but there's many people on the phone at that point because it was like a
*24:30.180- 24:35.380* :  bummer gun off. One of my colleagues at works with me, James, he brought one of the girls out
*24:35.380- 24:41.820* :  of the building and she didn't look good, poor kid. She was covered in blood. He was covered in blood.
*24:42.420- 24:46.420* :  The area where the attack happened is 90% families. I was told by one neighbour.
*24:46.960- 24:50.400* :  Everyone on the street either has children of their own or a grandparents.
*24:51.140- 24:54.260* :  Mothers and fathers who'd left their young ones to enjoy the holiday club,
*24:54.600- 24:56.560* :  raced here when they heard what was happening.
*24:57.160- 25:00.640* :  One neighbour said she'd heard a scream for help from the mother of a girl who'd been stabbed.
*25:01.140- 25:02.700* :  Her daughter was barely conscious.
*25:03.340- 25:07.540* :  The injured were taken to three hospitals on Mercyside and at the scene the investigation
*25:07.540- 25:12.800* :  is still continuing. The road is littered with medical equipment used to treat those who'd been heard.
*25:13.580- 25:17.640* :  Mercyside police say a man who lived about 15 minutes drive away from where the attack happened
*25:17.640- 25:22.340* :  was arrested shortly afterwards. A knife was found. He was taken away for questioning.
*25:22.340- 25:26.020* :  This evening they confirmed he's just 17 years old.
*25:26.780- 25:32.420* :  Nick Garnett. Staying in Britain and police have charged the former BBC presenter Hugh Edwards
*25:32.420- 25:37.980* :  with making indecent images of children following an investigation. Mr Edwards was
*25:37.980- 25:43.560* :  until last year one of Britain's most prominent journalists. The BBC's media correspondent David
*25:43.560- 25:48.300* :  Silito reports. A statement from the police this afternoon say Hugh Edwards was arrested
*25:48.300- 25:55.120* :  in November of 2023 and charged on the 26th of June of this year on three counts of
*25:55.120- 26:01.740* :  making indecent images of children. It's claimed a series of 31 photographs were found in a
*26:01.740- 26:06.560* :  WhatsApp chat on a mobile phone, six relating to the most serious category A offence.
*26:06.920- 26:11.660* :  A conviction at Crown Court of possession of a category A image could lead to a prison sentence
*26:11.660- 26:17.040* :  of three years. Now the offences are led to a taken place between December of 2020 and
*26:17.040- 26:22.200* :  April 2022 and Hugh Edwards of course did resign from the BBC in April of this year but
*26:22.900- 26:28.500* :  the BBC's highest profile, highest paid presenter hadn't been on air since July of last year.
*26:28.820- 26:32.340* :  A court hearing will take place on Wednesday. Westminster magistrates.
*26:32.740- 26:39.340* :  David Silito. On day three of the Olympic Games the Fencer Olga Karlin has won Ukraine's first
*26:39.340- 26:45.380* :  medal taking bronze in the women's individual saber. In the men's team gymnastics final,
*26:45.380- 26:51.920* :  Japan snatched victory from China in the last routine after China's Sue Wade slipped off the
*26:51.920- 26:57.520* :  high bar twice. In the swimming pool, 17-year-olds Summer Macintosh of Canada won gold
*26:57.520- 27:02.020* :  in the women's 400-meter individual medley as second medal of the Games.
*27:02.020- 27:07.000* :  I heard more on the day's events from the BBC's Paul Sarah's beginning in the pool.
*27:07.340- 27:13.040* :  The 20-year-old Australian Molly O'Callaghan beat her compatriot Ariane Titmuss to gold in the 200
*27:13.040- 27:18.300* :  meter freestyle. South Africa's Tatiana Schoenmacher took gold in the women's 100-meter
*27:18.300- 27:22.580* :  breaststroke and David Popovich won the men's 200 freestyle for Romania.
*27:23.400- 27:28.120* :  So many of the younger athletes at the Games involved in the pool at the other end of the scale,
*27:28.120- 27:35.980* :  two sporting giants met at Roland Garros. They did indeed. Yes, the 14-time French open champion
*27:35.980- 27:41.920* :  Rafael Nadal was beaten in straight sets by his old rival Novak Djokovic. Up next for Djokovic,
*27:42.260- 27:46.740* :  a third round meeting with the German Dominic Kepfer, while Nadal remains in the men's doubles
*27:46.740- 27:52.520* :  with his partner Carlos Alcarath, that terrifying Spanish duo taking on the Dutch pair of Talon
*27:52.520- 27:57.840* :  Greeksport and Wesley Callhof on Tuesday. And Paul, it was a particularly good day for Japan.
*27:58.440- 28:04.640* :  Yes, it was. Yes, their men retained the gymnastics team gold they won on home soil three years ago.
*28:05.120- 28:09.380* :  And Yuta Horigomi became double Olympic champion in the men's street skateboarding,
*28:09.700- 28:13.560* :  the Japanese are top of the medals table after day three with six golds.
*28:14.120- 28:18.520* :  And the US women's basketball team launched their different eighth consecutive gold medal.
*28:18.920- 28:25.060* :  Yeah, an eighth consecutive gold medal. It's astonishing. That run goes all the way back to Barcelona
*28:25.060- 28:33.080* :  in 1992. Their win over Japan earlier on Monday was their 56th in a row at the Olympic Games
*28:33.360- 28:39.580* :  and astonishing record for team USA. They take on Belgium next. And what else has made headlines
*28:39.580- 28:45.620* :  on day three? Great Britain's Tom Pidcock retained his Olympic cross country mountain biking title.
*28:45.980- 28:51.060* :  That's despite suffering a puncture which left him at his worst 40 seconds behind the leader.
*28:51.560- 28:56.140* :  Pidcock caught and passed the French rider Victor Karetski at the start of the final lap
*28:56.500- 29:02.320* :  and held on to become the double Olympic champion much to the shagran of the local fans who,
*29:02.320- 29:07.920* :  of course, were supporting Victor Karetski. Pidcock's medal was one of six for the British team on
*29:07.920- 29:13.300* :  Monday. The equestrian eventing team retained their title from Tokyo to the reigning champions
*29:13.300- 29:18.480* :  New Zealand thrashed China to set up a semi-final against the USA in the women's rugby sevens.
*29:18.680- 29:24.520* :  Canada will take on Australia in the other semi-final. All Sarah's on day three of the Olympic Games
*29:24.520- 29:31.520* :  in Paris. Elsewhere, the water quality in the river Sain is still causing concern. On Monday,
*29:31.520- 29:36.420* :  a second day of practice for the swimming leg of the triathlon was cancelled because of raised
*29:36.420- 29:42.020* :  pollution levels after heavy rain. The water levels were also very high causing faster currents.
*29:42.040- 29:48.600* :  The men's triathlon event is scheduled for Tuesday. Our Paris correspondent Andrew Harding reports.
*29:49.460- 29:54.180* :  The weather here is looking a little dicey. Scorching heat, thunderstorms and rain are all
*29:54.180- 30:00.460* :  forecast over the next few days. But in Paris, Olympic officials seem confident that men's triathlon
*30:00.460- 30:06.780* :  event will go ahead, starting with a 1,500 meter swim in the river Sain. Lambis Constantinides
*30:06.780- 30:11.880* :  is the Olympic planning director. The tendencies that we have, the trends that we have are very
*30:11.880- 30:18.400* :  positive. There will be a meeting at 4 a.m. to look at the latest figures to ensure that everybody's
*30:18.400- 30:22.780* :  comfortable with the water quality of their world purpose. And if that's the case, then we'll give
*30:22.780- 30:28.580* :  the green light to the competition. If not, then plan B involves postponing the men's event for a
*30:28.580- 30:34.840* :  day or so, the same for the women's triathlon. But if that doesn't work out, then plan C means
*30:34.840- 30:40.680* :  abandoning the swimming element of the triathlons altogether. Former triathlete and BBC commentator
*30:40.680- 30:46.100* :  Annie Emerson says that would be a great shame. Triathlon is a massive sport in France. There are
*30:46.240- 30:51.120* :  so many places that it could have been held. So if it doesn't go ahead, I think it will be a great
*30:51.120- 30:56.300* :  disappointment for the whole sport overall. France has invested heavily to make the river Sain
*30:56.300- 31:01.620* :  swimmable for the first time in a century. It's part of a broader push for a greener Olympics.
*31:01.620- 31:07.760* :  But climate change is already putting the games under strain. Andrew Harding in France.
*31:08.620- 31:14.360* :  Emerson has finally graduated from university 41 years after a parrot ruffled a few feathers.
*31:15.100- 31:19.720* :  Johnny Clothier was told he couldn't attend a ceremony at the University of Bristol and
*31:19.720- 31:25.640* :  South West England in 1983. This was because his flatmates bird had trashed their student
*31:25.640- 31:31.820* :  accommodation and a fine hadn't been paid. Dan Johnson takes up the story. Jonathan Clothier.
*31:33.920- 31:38.680* :  This graduation was a long time coming. Johnny Clothier, who's now 62,
*31:39.180- 31:44.220* :  lined up alongside those in their 20s at the University of Bristol. It was bad. It was really
*31:44.220- 31:49.240* :  fat. I kind of did it as a joke. He was barred from the ceremony when he completed his architecture
*31:49.240- 31:56.140* :  course in 1983 because 64 pounds 80 was outstanding on his student accommodation. Johnny and his
*31:56.140- 32:01.960* :  flatmates had been kicked out when their parrot made its mark having been left on its own.
*32:02.060- 32:06.020* :  It's a little bit young ones, really. One of our crazy flatmates had a parrot and we just
*32:06.820- 32:11.880* :  quietly went off for those bitterly holidays and left the parrot in the house. Did the parrot have a
*32:11.880- 32:15.380* :  name? We can't remember. No one could remember. We think it was called something really
*32:15.380- 32:21.060* :  dull like Peter. I studied biology. He was finally capped last week alongside his youngest son,
*32:21.060- 32:25.040* :  Carter. It's been a great three years. And your graduation wasn't in question. Your bills were
*32:25.040- 32:32.800* :  paid. Oh, absolutely. In full. Partly by my dad to be fair. It means every member of this
*32:32.800- 32:37.920* :  family is now graduated from the same university. Bristol University has kind of been the glue
*32:38.420- 32:44.340* :  that sticks us all together. How long they made you wait for this? No, not at all, not at all.
*32:44.380- 32:47.280* :  It's this way to Aberdeenling. Dan Johnson reporting.
*32:50.220- 32:54.900* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the Global News podcast later.

*33:55.320- 33:59.540* :  And the people behind some of the biggest companies on the planet, Google TikTok, for example.
*33:59.780- 34:03.660* :  But we are kicking off with a sporting superstar, Tiger Woods.
