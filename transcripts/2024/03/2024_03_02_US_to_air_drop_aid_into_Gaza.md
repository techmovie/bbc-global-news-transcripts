*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:12.560* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:49.140- 00:52.600* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:55.500- 01:01.480* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Saturday, the second of March, these are our main stories.
*01:02.080- 01:05.900* :  The US announces that it will start air-dropping aid into Gaza.
*01:06.280- 01:12.500* :  It is extremely difficult to do an air-drop in such a crowded environment as is Gaza.
*01:12.780- 01:14.980* :  A lot of people can find a small spaces.
*01:15.920- 01:20.740* :  It comes as the World Health Organization says that 10 children at a hospital in the past
*01:20.740- 01:25.180* :  in the Interratory have starved to death. The billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk
*01:25.180- 01:32.140* :  sews the company behind chat GPT artificial intelligence and the BBC reports from inside Iran
*01:32.560- 01:34.460* :  for the first time in five years.
*01:37.380- 01:43.360* :  Also in this podcast, Haiti strikes a deal that could potentially see Kenyan police patrolling
*01:43.360- 01:50.300* :  its streets in an effort to tackle lawlessness. And these elephant families are burying those cuffs.
*01:50.300- 01:55.120* :  They were heard of elephants. They were doing vocalization, which means they are making some sounds.
*01:55.440- 01:59.660* :  A remarkable discovery about Indian elephants and what they do with their dead.
*02:03.780- 02:09.080* :  The US has announced that it will start to air-drop humanitarian aid to Gaza over the coming days.
*02:09.080- 02:12.360* :  President Biden said not enough assistance was getting through,
*02:12.880- 02:17.440* :  and he also wanted hundreds more trucks to get into the Palestinian territory.
*02:17.440- 02:22.160* :  The White House said it was also redoubling its efforts to open a maritime corridor
*02:22.620- 02:26.680* :  to bring in more supplies. At a media briefing, the White House National Security
*02:26.680- 02:31.900* :  Advisor John Kirby said the logistics of an air-drop in Gaza would be challenging.
*02:32.460- 02:38.600* :  It is extremely difficult to do an air-drop in such a crowded environment as is Gaza.
*02:38.860- 02:42.920* :  Very, very densely populated. A lot of people can find a small spaces.
*02:43.280- 02:47.160* :  So you want to do it in a way that you can get it as close as you can to the people in need,
*02:47.480- 02:49.720* :  but not in a way that puts them in any danger.
*02:49.720- 02:53.200* :  And so the Pentagon will be doing a raft of planning on this.
*02:53.200- 02:57.100* :  They'll work their way through that, but I do want to stress that we fully expect that
*02:57.500- 03:00.700* :  the third and fourth and fifth one won't look like the first and second one.
*03:00.700- 03:02.500* :  We'll learn and we'll try to improve.
*03:03.260- 03:07.560* :  The announcement by the US comes amid growing warnings of famine in Gaza
*03:08.020- 03:11.460* :  as a result of the month-long conflict between Israel and Hamas.
*03:11.900- 03:16.020* :  On Friday, the World Health Organization said that a 10th child had been officially
*03:16.020- 03:19.660* :  registered in a Gaza hospital as having staffed to death,
*03:20.060- 03:22.320* :  and that the actual number is probably higher.
*03:22.500- 03:25.340* :  The figures were compiled by the Hamas Run Health Ministry.
*03:25.760- 03:28.700* :  Nettafik reports from the UN in New York.
*03:29.360- 03:33.760* :  The WHO spokesman Christian Lynn Meyer said the official number of children
*03:33.760- 03:38.020* :  to have starved to death in Gaza 10 was a very sad threshold,
*03:38.020- 03:41.340* :  and the real number was expected to be higher.
*03:41.340- 03:45.960* :  He said there had been multiple warnings that the system in Gaza was more than
*03:45.960- 03:51.920* :  on its knees, and the real catastrophe was that food and supplies were being cut off deliberately.
*03:52.820- 03:58.220* :  Mr. Lynn Meyer said the amount of aid that entered the territory in February was only half
*03:58.220- 04:03.280* :  of what came in in January, and even that was insufficient for the needs of the people.
*04:04.040- 04:06.540* :  Israel denies blocking the entry of aid.
*04:07.280- 04:12.520* :  Data collected by the UN in January showed one in six children in northern Gaza under the
*04:12.520- 04:18.280* :  age of two were acutely malnourished. Of them, three percent were suffering from severe
*04:18.280- 04:21.680* :  wasting, the most life-threatening form of malnutrition.
*04:22.480- 04:29.260* :  UN agencies say the situation is likely far graver now. Mr. Lynn Meyer reiterated the UN call
*04:29.260- 04:34.260* :  for a ceasefire. He said people had become so desperate for food and fresh water
*04:34.720- 04:38.500* :  that they were risking their lives to support their children and themselves.
*04:39.400- 04:44.160* :  Let it all fake in New York. Meanwhile, there has been growing international concern about
*04:44.160- 04:49.020* :  what happened to cause the deaths of more than 100 Palestinians seeking aid from a convoy
*04:49.320- 04:53.440* :  in northern Gaza. The growing number of countries have called for a full investigation,
*04:53.460- 04:59.160* :  which Israel says it has launched. On Friday, there was further disagreement about what exactly
*04:59.160- 05:05.160* :  happened. Israeli Army admitted it opened fire on people, but said most of the victims had been
*05:05.160- 05:10.960* :  trampled or crushed. However, that version was strongly contradicted by some doctors at Palestinian
*05:10.960- 05:16.740* :  hospitals from Jerusalem. Here's our correspondent, Paul Adams. With foreign governments calling for
*05:16.740- 05:21.860* :  an investigation, including Israel's close ally, the United States, questions remain about exactly
*05:21.860- 05:26.620* :  what happened in the early hours of yesterday morning. Israeli officials have acknowledged that
*05:26.620- 05:31.620* :  their forces opened fire on Palestinians they believed posed a threat, but they also claimed that
*05:31.620- 05:36.320* :  the vast majority of those who died were trampled under foot or run over by aid lorries.
*05:36.680- 05:42.460* :  Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht is an army spokesman. There was a mob and it was a massive
*05:42.460- 05:47.640* :  amount of people and these are people that approached the IDF. It was near and the vicinity
*05:47.640- 05:53.660* :  of the last truck of that convoy. Soldiers felt threatened. From what we understand at this point,
*05:54.240- 06:00.820* :  the majority of people that got hurt in this tragic event were from the engagement with these trucks.
*06:01.180- 06:05.160* :  But today, doctors in at least two of the hospitals, which received the dead and wounded,
*06:05.160- 06:10.920* :  said the injuries they saw were almost all caused by gunfire. Dr. Amjad Aliywa is a doctor at
*06:10.920- 06:15.320* :  Shifa Hospital. He told us that he joined the crowds waiting for aid on Wednesday night
*06:15.740- 06:19.720* :  and was there when the shooting began on Thursday morning. He was shot in the leg.
*06:19.940- 06:28.380* :  The trucks, when they came, everyone ran to get the food for his family. But the
*06:28.380- 06:38.520* :  Australian soldiers have been fired and about hundreds of people falling down and more than
*06:38.520- 06:44.520* :  1000 was injured. The crackle of automatic gunfire was clearly audible in video shot at the time
*06:44.520- 06:50.680* :  of the incident. But in the dark and the chaos, it wasn't clear who was shooting or why Israel says
*06:50.680- 06:57.720* :  it's still investigating. Paul Adams in Jerusalem. Elon Musk is returning to court. The world's
*06:57.720- 07:04.920* :  second richest man, who is worth $183 billion, is suing open AI, the makers of chat GPT.
*07:05.280- 07:09.580* :  Mr. Musk claims it's gone back on its founding principles of benefiting humanity,
*07:09.580- 07:15.560* :  and that instead, it's focused on maximising profits for its major investor, Microsoft.
*07:15.560- 07:18.800* :  I heard more from our Silicon Valley reporter, James Clayton.
*07:19.220- 07:23.980* :  He's really been frustrated for quite a few years now. Open AI was designed as a not for
*07:23.980- 07:28.760* :  profit, and as the name would suggest, it was designed to be open and transparent.
*07:29.120- 07:35.960* :  And so, very slowly, in a sort of piecemeal way, the company has become full profit,
*07:35.960- 07:42.600* :  or at least it has a full profit arm, and chat GPT and GPT are not open source.
*07:42.600- 07:49.180* :  And this lawsuit feels like inventing a bit of that frustration in a legal capacity.
*07:49.500- 07:55.440* :  Entrepreneurs are not normally against the concept of profit. I mean, could it also be that he's
*07:55.440- 08:00.780* :  not very happy that these profits are being now pocketed by the big investor, Microsoft?
*08:00.780- 08:05.060* :  He doesn't love that, but you've got to remember that Elon Musk is worth a lot of money.
*08:05.060- 08:10.700* :  He doesn't really mind that idea of Microsoft making money. His issue is much more that
*08:10.700- 08:16.180* :  open AI as a company has changed a lot, and he's absolutely not wrong in that.
*08:16.380- 08:21.180* :  When open AI was first founded nearly 10 years ago, it was a not for profit,
*08:21.340- 08:26.540* :  and they had all of these lofty ambitions about doing things in the name of saving the planets
*08:26.540- 08:30.520* :  and things like that. And now, it has more. There's no denying that.
*08:30.840- 08:35.520* :  It does those really sum up the whole issue of AI, doesn't it? Is it there to make money,
*08:35.520- 08:43.620* :  or is it there to benefit humanity? Exactly. And open AI have really struggles to create a company
*08:43.620- 08:50.040* :  that both puts the future of humanity in AI safety square and center, but also raise the kind
*08:50.040- 08:55.200* :  of capital needed to create a really successful generative AI company. And you need loads of
*08:55.200- 08:59.480* :  computing power, loads of investment. And so they took that decision that they were going to become
*08:59.480- 09:05.300* :  at least partly a full profit company a few years ago. By the way, open AI haven't got back to us,
*09:05.300- 09:10.380* :  but what they would say is that we needed to have a full profit arm of the company to grow. And
*09:10.380- 09:14.760* :  that was just inevitable. We had to let Microsoft in. James Clayton.
*09:16.060- 09:18.200* :  Iranians went to the polls on Friday.
*09:29.780- 09:35.620* :  They did so as the singer of this song, Shevin Hajipur, announced that he'd been jailed for more
*09:41.940- 09:47.100* :  than three years. His song, Bari or four, became an anthem for protests inspired by the death
*09:47.100- 09:53.480* :  in custody in September 2022 of a young Kurdish Iranian woman, Masa Amani, who'd been
*09:53.480- 09:59.380* :  detained for not wearing her hijab properly. The song listed many of the rights that the protesters
*09:59.380- 10:04.980* :  were demanding. Shevin Hajipur said that he'd been convicted of inciting people to riot,
*10:04.980- 10:11.200* :  and propaganda against the government. Friday's elections are the first in Iran since the death
*10:11.200- 10:18.380* :  of Masa Amani. After casting his ballot, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Hamani urged people
*10:18.380- 10:25.560* :  to vote because the world was watching. Our friends as well as our enemies are observing the
*10:25.560- 10:31.400* :  affairs of Iran. Pay attention to this. Make your friends happy and disappoint the ill wishes.
*10:32.260- 10:37.300* :  There are two elections, one for members of parliament. The other for members of the assembly
*10:37.300- 10:44.040* :  of experts who appoint Iran's supreme leader. The turnout is expected to be low. Our correspondent
*10:44.040- 10:49.620* :  Caroline Davis is in Tehran. Alex, it's been a fascinating day in Tehran. We started off the day
*10:49.760- 10:54.280* :  at a polling station in central Tehran, which has been one of the locations where international
*10:54.340- 11:00.180* :  and domestic media had been invited to. And there there was a celebratory mood. There was someone
*11:00.180- 11:05.160* :  who was handing out flowers to people outside. There was a newlywed couple, bride and groom,
*11:05.160- 11:11.340* :  a bride still head to toe in white. And there were some determined voters outside. We spoke to
*11:11.340- 11:17.320* :  several people who talked about why it was important to them to vote. And several of them cited
*11:17.320- 11:22.240* :  the supreme leader's recent comments urging people to come out that this was part of their duty to
*11:22.240- 11:29.120* :  do so as one of the reasons why they wanted to vote. In the free poll polling, there was a suggestion
*11:29.120- 11:35.400* :  that the turnout was going to be at record lows. Now, some presidential elections have exceeded
*11:35.400- 11:40.580* :  sort of 85 percent. But it is looking likely to be much lower in this particular parliamentary
*11:40.740- 11:45.760* :  election. We went to an area where people were doing their Novru's shopping. It's about two
*11:45.760- 11:50.780* :  weeks away from a new year here. And there, we could barely get anyone to stop and talk to us
*11:50.860- 11:55.340* :  about politics and complete contrast to the polling station. Those people who did want to talk to
*11:55.340- 12:01.280* :  us all wanted to do so anonymously. And several told us about why they were not voting. Their main
*12:01.280- 12:06.220* :  concerns were mostly the economy and inflation that they were very worried about. And they said that
*12:06.220- 12:11.720* :  they felt that voting in this election wouldn't make a difference to what the outcome of those
*12:11.720- 12:15.100* :  things would be. So they didn't feel like they were invested. They didn't feel like they wanted
*12:15.720- 12:20.780* :  to vote. So that will be the big decision here. Will we see people falling into the first camp,
*12:20.780- 12:25.080* :  encourage to come out and vote? Will we see them falling into the second camp of people feeling
*12:25.080- 12:28.540* :  that they're just not being heard? Do these elections have legitimacy?
*12:29.700- 12:35.220* :  There have been lots of questions about whether or not people have got a wide spectrum to be
*12:35.220- 12:43.120* :  able to vote for. There are over 15,000 people who are standing for the 290 parliamentary seats.
*12:43.580- 12:48.780* :  And the Iranian authorities have said this is a show of how free and fair these elections are,
*12:48.780- 12:53.300* :  that there are so many of these candidates that are available to be voted for. But critics have
*12:53.300- 12:59.220* :  said that a lot of people from the more sort of reformist side of politics have been excluded
*12:59.220- 13:06.240* :  from those lists. We also have seen some reformists boycott the election altogether and not stand.
*13:06.760- 13:11.760* :  And so big question is whether or not there really are enough different alternatives for people
*13:11.760- 13:19.300* :  to vote for that are on the ballot. Caroline Davis. A single killer whale has been caught on
*13:19.300- 13:25.620* :  camera for the first time hunting and killing a great white shark off the coast of South Africa.
*13:25.620- 13:31.040* :  Scientists say the behaviour showed the exceptional hunting skill of killer whales. But it raised
*13:31.040- 13:36.740* :  questions about how shark eating orcas might affect the food chain in that part of the ocean
*13:36.740- 13:42.560* :  as our science correspondent Victoria Gill explains. The attack was filmed from a boat and it's
*13:42.560- 13:47.900* :  tricky to make out in all the surface splashing. But the footage shows a male orca pursuing and
*13:47.900- 13:53.640* :  killing a young eight foot long great white shark. It took less than two minutes. In a detailed
*13:53.640- 13:58.280* :  somewhat grizzly scientific account, researchers described how the killer whale grabbed the shark
*13:58.280- 14:03.380* :  by the dorsal fin and thrust forward several times before eventually eviscerating it.
*14:03.960- 14:08.020* :  Scientists have seen killer whales off the South African coast hunting sharks before.
*14:08.020- 14:13.400* :  They filmed the attacks with drones back in 2022. But then the whales were working together
*14:13.400- 14:18.140* :  with one animal blocking the shark's escape while another attacked. This solitary hunt,
*14:18.140- 14:24.200* :  the scientists say, is surprisingly risky. And it's a snapshot, they say, of what adaptable predators
*14:24.200- 14:29.640* :  orcas are, learning exactly how to tackle a powerful, dangerous animal in pursuit of a meal.
*14:30.240- 14:37.440* :  Victoria Gill. Scientists in India have found elephants showing similar behaviour to humans when
*14:37.440- 14:42.840* :  it comes to mourning their dead. The new study revealed that not only do they loudly mourn,
*14:42.840- 14:48.780* :  but they bury their dead calves. Parvine Kazwan from the Indian Forestry Service carried out the
*14:48.780- 14:56.160* :  study. He spoke to Julian Marshall from Ali Purdwa in eastern India and explained what had inspired
*14:56.160- 15:02.220* :  the research. I'm a forest officer. I was working in a tiger reserve in North Bengal. So the place
*15:02.220- 15:09.520* :  where I was living, it was also an elephant reserve. And one day in 2022, he saw a strange case where
*15:09.520- 15:16.760* :  I saw that in a tea estate, one calf was buried, the position was legs upright, and half part was
*15:16.760- 15:23.620* :  buried by sand, mud, etc. So I thought, is there any pattern? Is there any story behind it?
*15:23.900- 15:30.300* :  And then we decided to document such cases. And within two years, we documented five of such cases,
*15:30.300- 15:37.520* :  actually. You say similar cases of death calves buried in the ground. Yes, in the trenches,
*15:37.980- 15:42.460* :  which are located in tea estates, in the similar position, legs upright position.
*15:42.860- 15:49.280* :  And who buried the calves? Elephants themselves. So the family buried those calves.
*15:49.740- 15:55.620* :  And while they were doing so, even people who were living besides these tea estates,
*15:56.060- 16:03.700* :  labor or tea estate owners, managers, they also heard loud vocalization by a group of elephants.
*16:04.020- 16:08.260* :  And in morning, when we checked, we saw that a number of elephants, there are
*16:08.260- 16:14.320* :  pig marks of elephants. And they have buried those calves with the sand. And there are number
*16:14.320- 16:20.760* :  of dung piles, which are small to large, which shows it was a community work. So these elephant
*16:20.760- 16:25.700* :  families, they are burying those calves. I have observed two such burials. They were
*16:25.700- 16:31.400* :  heard of elephants from a distance we observed everything. So a herd of elephants, they were doing
*16:31.400- 16:36.080* :  vocalization, which means they are making some sounds. And they were doing some activity.
*16:36.080- 16:42.400* :  And then they left this location after say 30, 40 minutes. Evidence suggested to you that the
*16:42.460- 16:50.980* :  dead calves had been buried by other members of the herd. Yes, see, I'm working in this field
*16:50.980- 16:57.940* :  from many years. And I have seen dead calves being lifted and transported by elephants and mothers
*16:58.620- 17:03.680* :  for days, for one of the case I documented, the mother took that calf for two, three days.
*17:04.000- 17:09.860* :  So yes, we have already seen those behaviors. And this of course is very reminiscent, isn't it
*17:09.860- 17:18.260* :  of human funeral rights? What does it tell you, therefore, about the emotional bandwidth of elephants?
*17:18.780- 17:23.880* :  As we know that, I mean, elephants are very emotional. They are very intelligent and they are
*17:23.880- 17:30.500* :  sentient beings. We know how mothers, they teach everything to their calves, remembering the water
*17:30.500- 17:36.900* :  holes, remembering the old parts, the migratory parts, then this aspect, which we documented and
*17:36.900- 17:42.500* :  republished, really shows how emotional they are. As far as I know and I have talked with many
*17:42.500- 17:47.200* :  experts in this field, this is first such documentation from Asian elephants.
*17:47.740- 17:51.560* :  So you are saying that it has been observed in African elephants?
*17:52.140- 17:57.300* :  Yes, in African elephants, there are a few studies which is conducted in a similar rate, yes.
*18:04.520- 18:11.160* :  Still to come in the global news podcast. I remember 1976, a very snow-rich winter.
*18:11.760- 18:16.160* :  I remember the 80s, it was cold, but then suddenly it stopped, no snow.
*18:16.480- 18:18.880* :  It's been coming for a while. For a long while.
*18:19.420- 18:24.160* :  Could skiing on Europe's mountain slopes become a thing of the past?
*18:31.040- 18:36.300* :  Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere and one of the most lawless.
*18:36.300- 18:41.520* :  According to the UN, nearly 5,000 deaths were reported last year, more than double the
*18:41.520- 18:47.400* :  number seen in 2022. Now, in a bid to try to restore calm, the Prime Minister, Ariel Henri,
*18:47.740- 18:52.160* :  has signed a bilateral agreement with Kenya that could pave the way for a thousand
*18:52.160- 18:57.680* :  Kenyan police officers to take part in a UN mission to tackle the gang-related violence that's
*18:57.680- 19:02.040* :  played the Caribbean nation. The plan has been blocked by Kenya's high court.
*19:02.440- 19:08.020* :  Speaking at a public lecture in Nairobi, Mr. Henri said it was currently too dangerous to hold
*19:08.020- 19:13.360* :  elections. Because of the violence, we cannot go to elections and one of the things that we
*19:13.480- 19:19.700* :  aim is to have elections as soon as possible. Because we need election in order to stabilize
*19:19.700- 19:26.420* :  the country. We need a democratic governance in order to have people to come to invest in
*19:26.420- 19:31.920* :  Haiti. It remains to be seen if the Kenyan deployment will now go ahead, but in the
*19:31.920- 19:36.960* :  Prime Minister's absence, Haiti has suffered another bout of gang violence. Harold Isaac,
*19:36.960- 19:42.380* :  as a journalist in the capital, Porter Prince, asked him what the mood was like after Thursday's
*19:42.380- 19:49.440* :  unrest. Today, it's considerably calmer than yesterday, where the city was essentially facing
*19:49.440- 19:54.880* :  a surge of gang violence, attacking several institutions, including the international airport.
*19:55.080- 20:00.720* :  Are people hopeful that this deployment of the Kenyan forces will finally make things change
*20:00.720- 20:07.180* :  for the better? Well, people are not sure what to expect from it. It's no secret that it's
*20:07.180- 20:13.420* :  going to be a daunting mission, but after nearly three years of intense escalation of gang violence,
*20:13.420- 20:18.680* :  many folks here are hoping for something to happen. Even what we've heard about how everyday life
*20:18.680- 20:24.220* :  is just broken down in Haiti, how do people survive? How do you survive? You're there in these
*20:24.220- 20:28.720* :  conditions, which really don't sound much short of sheer anarchy. It's a checkered reality.
*20:28.720- 20:35.560* :  Honestly, gangs are in control of about 80 percent of the metropolitan area of Porter Prince.
*20:35.800- 20:41.040* :  One has to think of the ones commute every day, how you go to places, how you get back. For
*20:41.040- 20:47.220* :  instance, yesterday I went to my office downtown and had to cut my day short to evacuate because
*20:47.220- 20:52.540* :  the violence was closing in. Gangs were for the most part shooting all over the place or cutting
*20:52.540- 20:58.800* :  roads with barricades. Once that happens, you try to play as safe as possible and seek shelter.
*20:59.240- 21:04.820* :  For instance, today I avoided going downtown, just like many other people I know did. You never
*21:04.860- 21:11.120* :  too far away from the violence. I mean, I either are going to run into a situation or hear shootings.
*21:11.440- 21:15.420* :  Listen, I had friends that were at the airport yesterday that were grazed by bullets. So
*21:16.140- 21:22.080* :  it's a surreal reality, but the thing in Haiti is like every day is an act of resistance. For
*21:22.080- 21:27.160* :  most folks that I know here that are in love with the country and that don't want to go, they
*21:27.160- 21:32.400* :  try to fight ways to survive and to at least try and keep their business going.
*21:32.840- 21:35.940* :  Journalist Harold Isaac speaking to me from Porter Prince.
*21:37.280- 21:43.400* :  In South Korea, it's illegal for doctors to go on strike, but that hasn't stopped nearly 10,000
*21:43.400- 21:48.860* :  junior doctors staging a mass walkout this week. On Friday, they were targeted by the police who
*21:48.860- 21:54.260* :  raided the headquarters of the Korean Medical Association. Doctors are protesting against the
*21:54.260- 21:59.280* :  government's plans to sharply increase the number of medical schoolplaces, claiming they would
*21:59.280- 22:05.420* :  get paid less if this happened. The dispute looks set to get worse, as our Asia pacific editor Celia
*22:05.420- 22:12.100* :  hadn't told me. Really, we're all looking ahead to Monday. On Sunday, there's expected to be a
*22:12.100- 22:19.580* :  mass rally of doctors, 25,000 people are expected to take to the streets. We're also going to see
*22:19.580- 22:26.140* :  on Sunday the Korean Medical Association, which will vote on whether senior doctors should join
*22:26.140- 22:32.080* :  the walkout. Then, looking forward to Monday, that's when the government says that they will start
*22:32.080- 22:38.680* :  to initiate possible criminal proceedings, so we might see some arrests, and the government has
*22:38.680- 22:43.800* :  also said they're going to start moving forward with licensed suspensions. It looks like they'll
*22:43.800- 22:49.500* :  probably suspend licenses at first for up to three months. Yeah, you mentioned criminal proceedings,
*22:49.500- 22:54.800* :  and also this police raid on the Korean Medical Association. What are they looking for?
*22:54.980- 23:00.620* :  Well, that's right. This seems to happen a lot. Police carry out raids whenever an organization
*23:00.620- 23:08.380* :  is under pressure. The Korean Medical Association has criticized the raid, saying that they're under
*23:08.380- 23:14.220* :  pressure. They're facing intimidation tactics. But, you know, strike culture is very strong in
*23:14.220- 23:21.040* :  South Korea. I will say that the President, Yun Suk-yul, has a track record of really standing up to
*23:21.040- 23:28.720* :  organizations that are striking back in 2022. South Korean truckers went on strike for three weeks.
*23:28.720- 23:34.740* :  They were demanding all sorts of changes to their wages and also to change in laws and how much
*23:34.740- 23:40.240* :  they were able to carry on their trucks. They had to back down after three weeks. They were
*23:40.240- 23:46.300* :  ordered back to work. Yun's government did not back down and negotiate with them. So that
*23:46.300- 23:51.880* :  administration really does have a strong track record of not giving in. Why is this proving so
*23:51.880- 23:57.460* :  hard to resolve? I think it's a tricky one. Actually, the public opinion so far seems to be with the
*23:57.460- 24:06.020* :  government on this one. South Korea will need an extra 15,000 doctors by 2035. And so the government
*24:06.020- 24:11.480* :  is saying, look, we really need to do something about this quickly as the population ages. However,
*24:11.480- 24:17.100* :  the doctors are saying, but that could affect our wages. And it also could affect the quality
*24:17.100- 24:23.440* :  of medical school education. And that could damage the services that we're able to offer. And so
*24:23.440- 24:29.100* :  it looks like it's quite a tense situation right now. But at the moment, public opinion is on the
*24:29.100- 24:37.380* :  side of the government, not the doctors. It's a ski season in Europe, which is home to some
*24:37.380- 24:43.280* :  of the world's best slopes. But with another warmer than average winter, snow in lower lying
*24:43.280- 24:47.860* :  resorts is in short supply. What climate scientists have been warning you out for years,
*24:48.500- 24:52.280* :  has now become reality. And many resorts are facing an uncertain future.
*24:52.760- 24:56.340* :  Imagine folks in Switzerland has been finding out how they're coping.
*24:59.640- 25:03.020* :  So I'm on my way somewhere. I haven't been for oh, it must be 20 years.
*25:03.940- 25:09.240* :  It's a little ski resort just half an hour from Baer, and it's called Rusek Eyvalt.
*25:09.780- 25:13.540* :  And that's where I and my family did some of our first skiing.
*25:16.700- 25:25.160* :  My name is Michael Kerkel. I'm the president of the ski lift Eyvalt. The problem is that it's
*25:25.160- 25:28.300* :  snow, snow here. This winter, we can't open it.
*25:28.300- 25:34.560* :  Michael and I are standing at the bottom of what Switzerland's fourth longest tea bar lift.
*25:35.040- 25:41.080* :  I remember it well because it's almost two and a half kilometers long. If you can't ski when
*25:41.080- 25:47.640* :  you get on it, you probably can't buy the time you get off. But this year, Michael tells me
*25:47.640- 25:53.000* :  the lift hasn't been open for a single day. And last year, for only four.
*25:58.100- 26:04.600* :  It didn't used to be like this. When the Rusek Eyvalt lift opened in 1969, it was hugely
*26:04.600- 26:10.700* :  popular with families across Kenton Baerne. Nicknamed affectionately little Grindelwald,
*26:10.700- 26:17.600* :  town mayor, Marcus Hearshy remembers, after the bigger, more famous resort, not so far away.
*26:17.740- 26:24.720* :  Back then, people had big ideas, calling it little Grindelwald. People bought shares in the
*26:24.720- 26:30.360* :  lift. They thought, yes, here's a thriving resort. Thinking about it, it's quite emotional.
*26:33.600- 26:41.300* :  But the era of weeks, months, even, of snow in the Alps is long gone. In his office at Baerne University,
*26:41.420- 26:48.640* :  climatologist Stefan Brunnimen is surrounded by books. I love them. I mean, I cannot fit everything
*26:48.640- 26:55.520* :  here. Documenting the warming of the planet and the rising snow line. Winters were cold and
*26:55.520- 27:03.360* :  snowy in the 70s. I remember 1976. A very snow-rich winter. I remember the 80s. It was cold. We were
*27:03.360- 27:13.160* :  skating on lakes, but then suddenly it stopped. 1989, no snow. It was green everywhere. 1990, no snow.
*27:13.820- 27:20.220* :  So it's been coming for a while. It's for a long while. And already back then, people said,
*27:20.220- 27:31.840* :  you have to change. A now it's not just lower-lying resorts like Rusek that are threatened.
*27:32.420- 27:37.980* :  Some of Switzerland's most prestigious ski races, like the Lauberhorn, have struggled recently
*27:37.980- 27:45.340* :  to get their slopes ready. Stefan Brunnimen sees those golden years when the Swiss were either on
*27:45.340- 27:53.280* :  the slopes or watching their ski stars win medals disappearing. Saturdays, at noon, everyone was
*27:53.280- 27:59.760* :  in front of the television. And that's also changed. As ski races, they need to face that. We had
*27:59.760- 28:05.620* :  the discussion all winter, this winter, and also they face the same problem. And so I'm not
*28:05.620- 28:13.340* :  sure whether skiing at all will really be still the main entertainment of Swiss people at least in the
*28:13.340- 28:23.260* :  future. So where does that leave Rusek and its long idle ski lift? Michael Kegel is under no illusions.
*28:26.540- 28:31.720* :  Climate change is clear. We can see it. The days with snow are fewer and fewer. I think in 10
*28:31.720- 28:37.160* :  years we won't be in business. I say that with a heavy heart. I skied here as a child too. I expect
*28:37.160- 28:42.860* :  in 10 years it will be a nature area here. We just have to make the best of it. Michael Kegel
*28:43.180- 28:51.140* :  ending that report by Imogen folks. And finally, single people here in the UK are spending less time
*28:51.140- 28:56.140* :  getting to know their prospective partners. And a cutting date short. So what's behind the
*28:56.140- 29:01.700* :  change in behaviour? Former dating expert David Lewis has taken a look at the numbers.
*29:06.080- 29:11.980* :  Long arm in arm walks in the country, sharing a bottle of red in front of a roaring fire,
*29:12.300- 29:19.180* :  patiently getting to know your prospective life partner at a picnic, not anymore. The dating
*29:19.180- 29:24.160* :  game is moving with the times. No longer content with boring and pricey nights out,
*29:24.600- 29:29.640* :  singletons in recession hit Britain are cutting back. And it's a ruthless world out there.
*29:30.220- 29:35.660* :  That's according to research group opinion, who surveyed nearly 4,000 data here in the UK.
*29:36.320- 29:40.660* :  Almost half of those questioned say they were more likely to end things early,
*29:40.660- 29:45.740* :  because they didn't want to waste money with someone with no game and zero spark.
*29:45.820- 29:54.100* :  That jumps to 56% for Gen Zedders. That's those born after 1996. But ferret underfinances and
*29:54.100- 29:59.920* :  there might be a bigger picture at play. Relationship coach for Hema Muhammad told the BBC that
*29:59.920- 30:06.440* :  data just don't have the patience they once had. Single people nowadays want an instant spark,
*30:06.440- 30:11.840* :  instant gratification, she told the BBC. In the same way they used to getting their needs met
*30:11.840- 30:17.440* :  instantly through websites like Amazon. If they don't get that immediately, they cut things off.
*30:17.980- 30:23.360* :  Muhammad also points to the lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic. She suggests single
*30:23.360- 30:28.700* :  people who've had to stay celibate during lockdowns are more likely to jump from one person to the
*30:28.700- 30:34.520* :  next to make a match. Those that feel they've lost out on years of prime dating time are keen
*30:34.520- 30:40.180* :  to make up for it. And then some. But at the other end of the spectrum, for those in a relationship,
*30:40.180- 30:47.320* :  it's still the case cash can skybosh. British paper The Times recently reported on The Couple
*30:47.320- 30:54.000* :  Paws, a new name for a slump in sex, enjoyed or otherwise by some middle aged couples. And the
*30:54.000- 31:07.860* :  reason? Growing financial stress. Forma, dating expert David Lewis, former
*31:07.860- 31:17.380* :  high stress, because he's now married. And that's all from us for now. But there'll be a new
