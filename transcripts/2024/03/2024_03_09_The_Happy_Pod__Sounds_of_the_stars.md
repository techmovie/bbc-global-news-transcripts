*01:09.840- 01:10.540* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*01:10.540- 01:14.520* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*01:14.880- 01:15.860* :  They charge you a lot.
*01:15.860- 01:17.180* :  We charge you a little.
*01:17.500- 01:21.100* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*01:21.140- 01:24.900* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*01:25.220- 01:28.400* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month

*01:49.480- 01:53.020* :  We're here to shine a light on some surprising and inspiring places
*01:53.020- 01:54.300* :  and what we can learn from them.
*01:54.600- 01:56.840* :  Let's be a woman from the BBC World Service.
*01:57.180- 01:59.580* :  Listen now wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*02:01.660- 02:04.740* :  This week, NASA harnesses the power of sound
*02:04.760- 02:07.440* :  to help people visualize our universe.
*02:07.740- 02:09.960* :  When you're listening to something over time,
*02:09.960- 02:13.480* :  your ear is really sensitive to your able to pick up more data.
*02:13.860- 02:17.620* :  It's another way to be able to find a needle in a haystack.
*02:17.680- 02:20.720* :  It's like having another tool in your tool belt, if you will.
*02:25.760- 02:27.080* :  This is the happy pod.
*02:27.080- 02:28.080* :  I'm Harry Bly.
*02:28.480- 02:28.980* :  Bees.
*02:29.340- 02:32.440* :  Once a minute or so, we heard this whoop whoop.
*02:33.140- 02:35.480* :  Meet the man making them whoop.
*02:35.940- 02:38.800* :  And finding a way to check the health of bee colonies
*02:39.320- 02:41.220* :  during winter without disturbing them.
*02:41.580- 02:44.240* :  Hello, my name is Dr Martin Benchick.
*02:44.560- 02:47.160* :  I've been studying honey bees, bee hives,
*02:47.580- 02:49.340* :  listening out for whooping signals,
*02:50.180- 02:51.860* :  and you're listening to the happy pod
*02:51.860- 02:54.120* :  from the BBC World Service.
*02:54.680- 02:56.820* :  A basketball record in the United States.
*03:01.540- 03:03.320* :  Caitlin Clark, making history,
*03:03.320- 03:06.040* :  netting 35 points in a single game.
*03:06.600- 03:07.920* :  Also in this podcast,
*03:07.920- 03:10.820* :  we're looking at rare and endangered languages.
*03:11.440- 03:14.060* :  We ask you, our listeners, to get in touch.
*03:14.280- 03:14.740* :  Merhaba.
*03:14.900- 03:16.020* :  My name is Mamata,
*03:16.240- 03:17.440* :  or Flomkinah Denizamo.
*03:17.440- 03:18.340* :  The leditiani,
*03:18.680- 03:19.340* :  the happy pod,
*03:19.700- 03:21.020* :  whoop the BBC World Service.
*03:27.020- 03:28.320* :  Take a listen to this.
*03:30.880- 03:33.080* :  And try and guess where it's from.
*03:42.300- 03:44.540* :  This is the sound from space.
*03:44.620- 03:47.780* :  NASA has released these extraordinary compositions,
*03:47.780- 03:51.220* :  which are created by translating data into noise.
*03:51.820- 03:53.300* :  They're called sonifications,
*03:53.300- 03:57.400* :  and we're originally designed to help blind people imagine space.
*03:58.040- 03:59.220* :  But for astronomers too,
*03:59.300- 04:02.920* :  they're a useful tool to help better understand the universe.
*04:04.040- 04:06.020* :  Here's Dr Kimbley Arkand.
*04:06.020- 04:10.200* :  She's a data visualiser at NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory.
*04:10.600- 04:13.820* :  So we've just released three new data sonifications
*04:13.820- 04:16.400* :  from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory.
*04:16.640- 04:18.280* :  And what that means is we're listening
*04:18.280- 04:20.780* :  to the translation of information
*04:20.780- 04:22.880* :  from a visual into sound.
*04:23.300- 04:25.120* :  Well, we're going to hear one of those sounds now.
*04:37.960- 04:40.620* :  It's essentially the leftover debris field
*04:40.620- 04:42.500* :  from a star that exploded.
*04:43.060- 04:45.700* :  And we're listening to the different kinds of light.
*04:46.100- 04:50.920* :  So we're listening to X-ray light from the XB spacecraft
*04:50.920- 04:52.940* :  as well as the Chandra spacecraft.
*04:53.600- 04:57.340* :  And what happens is we mathematically map the information
*04:57.580- 04:58.320* :  into sound.
*04:58.780- 05:01.440* :  And we're scanning the data from the bottom to the top.
*05:01.440- 05:04.600* :  So the brightness that we're hearing, for example,
*05:04.620- 05:05.940* :  in the Chandra data,
*05:05.940- 05:09.000* :  that's being converted into these string-like sounds.
*05:09.700- 05:11.720* :  And the blast wave is being represented
*05:11.720- 05:15.380* :  by sort of like a fireworks type of noise.
*05:21.200- 05:23.440* :  So what is it that these sonifications
*05:24.140- 05:26.740* :  can tell us that we might not notice
*05:26.740- 05:29.200* :  when we're observing in a visual way?
*05:29.720- 05:31.240* :  Well, sonifications are great
*05:31.240- 05:34.760* :  when you have very dense and rich data sets
*05:34.760- 05:39.020* :  because your eye is getting all of the information at once.
*05:39.020- 05:41.500* :  But when you're listening to something over time,
*05:41.560- 05:45.000* :  your ear is really sensitive to be able to pick up more data.
*05:45.260- 05:49.640* :  So it's another way to be able to find a needle in a haystack.
*05:49.660- 05:52.760* :  It's like having another tool in your tool belt, if you will.
*05:53.480- 05:57.120* :  And am I right in thinking that the project is primarily designed
*05:57.320- 06:00.140* :  to help blind people, visually impaired people?
*06:00.740- 06:05.220* :  Yes, though, sonification is a totally valid research tool
*06:05.220- 06:08.100* :  that astronomers use on this project
*06:08.100- 06:11.000* :  was created to be able to connect with our community members
*06:11.000- 06:12.760* :  who are blind or low vision.
*06:13.260- 06:15.440* :  What kind of reaction have you had from those communities?
*06:15.920- 06:18.940* :  This has been helpful to them to feel like they are
*06:18.940- 06:21.600* :  part of that scientific enterprise
*06:21.600- 06:24.220* :  and also give back something to it.
*06:24.560- 06:26.660* :  Because we work with people who are blind or low vision
*06:26.660- 06:29.860* :  to actually help create these sonifications as well.
*06:30.400- 06:34.020* :  It really is a moment to be able to work with another community
*06:34.340- 06:35.720* :  and learn from each other.
*06:39.400- 06:42.320* :  Dr Kimberley Arcan speaking to Martha Carney
*06:42.520- 06:45.280* :  and that's rather ominous sounding sonification
*06:45.280- 06:49.720* :  is the interpretation of the Jellyfish Nebula IC-443.
*06:50.300- 06:52.900* :  All of these sounds are featured in a new short documentary
*06:52.900- 06:57.320* :  Listen to the Universe, which you can watch on the nasa.gov website.
*06:59.020- 07:01.460* :  Now, we promise we are not making this up.
*07:01.840- 07:04.260* :  Scientists have found that bees whoop
*07:04.680- 07:07.460* :  and they make the distinctive sound when they bump into each other
*07:07.800- 07:08.400* :  by mistake.
*07:08.460- 07:12.100* :  The discovery could allow beekeepers to check on their colonies
*07:12.100- 07:15.460* :  during winter months without exposing them to the elements.
*07:16.100- 07:19.420* :  Instead, a gentle tapping on the hive encourages the bees
*07:19.520- 07:20.960* :  to respond in unison.
*07:28.180- 07:31.920* :  The scientist behind this discovery is Professor Martin Benchick
*07:31.920- 07:33.960* :  from Nottingham Trent University in Britain.
*07:34.460- 07:37.360* :  He says this kind of technology could be relatively easy
*07:37.360- 07:40.440* :  to set up for professional and hobbyist beekeepers
*07:40.440- 07:44.320* :  for around $25 if manufactured on a large scale.
*07:44.520- 07:46.820* :  He told us how this all came about.
*07:47.840- 07:52.020* :  We noticed simply by listening to the continuous vibrations
*07:52.020- 07:54.160* :  that we were monitoring inside the colony,
*07:54.720- 07:57.880* :  once a minute or so we heard this whoop, whoop,
*07:58.240- 08:02.020* :  signal by gently tapping on the hive.
*08:02.020- 08:05.440* :  We could have many bees that go whoop together
*08:05.440- 08:09.080* :  so you could have hundreds of bees going whoop together
*08:09.620- 08:13.960* :  and that drew our attention and we could all our attention,
*08:13.960- 08:17.980* :  all our efforts to try and explore this exciting signal.
*08:18.580- 08:22.380* :  And so we suggested that this signal was originating
*08:22.380- 08:24.100* :  from a surprised bee.
*08:24.560- 08:27.760* :  Perhaps the honey bee colony is made of individuals
*08:27.760- 08:30.680* :  that are crammed together in a small space
*08:31.520- 08:34.240* :  and perhaps they collide into each other accidentally
*08:34.240- 08:36.520* :  due to this small space that they've got.
*08:37.120- 08:39.720* :  And in colliding into each other accidentally,
*08:40.480- 08:43.420* :  perhaps they go whoop like this spontaneously.
*08:44.300- 08:46.000* :  And so we tried and demonstrate this
*08:46.120- 08:50.360* :  and we did actually have a video of bees accidentally
*08:50.360- 08:52.360* :  colliding into each other.
*08:52.740- 08:56.360* :  And indeed this results in one of the two bees going whoop.
*08:57.800- 08:58.480* :  Why bees?
*08:59.080- 09:02.220* :  What is it that makes bees your area of interest?
*09:03.100- 09:06.460* :  In life, we make three types of acquaintances.
*09:07.520- 09:13.860* :  You meet people who drag you down because of their behavior.
*09:14.460- 09:16.980* :  And we meet people who are our equal.
*09:18.060- 09:21.620* :  They inspire us and they make us do the same things
*09:21.620- 09:23.060* :  that we would do every day.
*09:23.460- 09:25.760* :  And then the third category of people we meet,
*09:26.140- 09:28.720* :  they inspire us and they pull us upwards.
*09:29.600- 09:32.560* :  We feel they're inspiring us because they do better
*09:32.560- 09:33.360* :  than we can.
*09:33.800- 09:36.860* :  And to me, the honey bee is the third category
*09:36.860- 09:38.940* :  of things I've encountered in my life.
*09:39.480- 09:41.640* :  It's an animal that's so inspiring.
*09:42.240- 09:45.460* :  It challenges me and it makes me research
*09:45.460- 09:48.900* :  and do things that I wouldn't do otherwise
*09:48.900- 09:51.620* :  because I find it such an inspiring animal.
*09:52.140- 09:54.080* :  Martin Benchick, professor of physics,
*09:54.860- 09:56.060* :  specializing in bees.
*09:56.880- 09:59.520* :  Next on the happy pod, a couple of weeks ago,
*09:59.520- 10:02.700* :  we found out more about the language of Scottish Gallic,
*10:03.060- 10:06.500* :  a language spoken by an estimated 60,000 or so people.
*10:07.280- 10:08.660* :  And this sparked an idea.
*10:09.020- 10:09.560* :  Here's Jackie.
*10:10.120- 10:11.940* :  It did make us wonder about other languages
*10:11.940- 10:14.320* :  that listeners speak that might be rare
*10:14.320- 10:16.680* :  but are still worth preserving, celebrating
*10:17.020- 10:17.860* :  and indeed speaking.
*10:17.860- 10:20.740* :  Do let us know the usual address global podcast
*10:20.740- 10:23.100* :  at bbc.co.uk.
*10:24.020- 10:27.860* :  And as if by magic, Amy Tellma Kermey got in touch.
*10:42.780- 10:47.080* :  Amy assured me here that this is her talking about why she loves the happy pod
*10:47.420- 10:49.260* :  in her native language of multis.
*10:49.640- 10:51.740* :  I'm just going to have to trust her on that.
*10:52.300- 10:54.420* :  She went on to tell us more about the language
*10:54.420- 10:56.320* :  and the island of Malta.
*10:56.800- 10:58.620* :  So Malta is really a small island.
*10:58.680- 11:04.140* :  It is 27 kilometers long by 14.5 kilometers wide.
*11:05.200- 11:07.700* :  But it's in a really strategic place in the Mediterranean.
*11:08.280- 11:10.620* :  And so throughout history, we've been conquered
*11:10.620- 11:13.960* :  by lots and lots of different forces.
*11:14.500- 11:16.720* :  So that's where we get the differences in our language.
*11:17.560- 11:20.260* :  So Malta is a whole mixture of Arabic
*11:20.620- 11:23.200* :  and then it also has elements of Italian.
*11:24.140- 11:26.120* :  So if we ever go to somewhere Arabic,
*11:26.120- 11:29.000* :  we can understand roughly what they're saying.
*11:29.320- 11:32.780* :  But then you also go to Italy and you can also understand the words they're saying.
*11:33.320- 11:35.180* :  And then we also have elements of English.
*11:35.420- 11:36.640* :  There's lots of English words.
*11:37.160- 11:38.620* :  But they're spelled in multis.
*11:39.160- 11:41.180* :  So multis are spelled like it's not,
*11:41.280- 11:42.260* :  doesn't look like Arabic,
*11:42.520- 11:44.380* :  but it sounds a lot like Arabic.
*11:44.840- 11:47.560* :  So we have it's a bit more complicated.
*11:48.240- 11:50.920* :  So over to you, tell us about your native language
*11:51.280- 11:52.780* :  or perhaps one you've been learning.
*11:53.260- 11:57.540* :  The email address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*11:58.580- 12:01.740* :  To the USA next, where a new champion goal scorer
*12:01.740- 12:04.640* :  is being celebrated in the world of college basketball.
*12:05.220- 12:09.200* :  22-year-old Caitlin Clark is now the all-time champion goal scorer
*12:09.420- 12:11.940* :  in both the women's and men's college basketball.
*12:12.640- 12:15.720* :  The Iowa Hawkeye's player netted 35 points
*12:15.720- 12:17.820* :  against rival Ohio State,
*12:18.360- 12:22.520* :  bringing her career total to 3685 points,
*12:22.520- 12:25.620* :  beating the previous record holder Pete Maravitch.
*12:26.120- 12:29.840* :  She spoke to Good Morning America about scoring that historical point.
*12:30.640- 12:32.140* :  When I first went out there and looked at it,
*12:32.140- 12:34.060* :  I'm like, this has to be in the wrong spot.
*12:34.060- 12:37.280* :  Like it seems way further back from where I actually shot it from.
*12:37.520- 12:38.780* :  How will she go for history?
*12:42.280- 12:43.220* :  This is what I dreamed of.
*12:43.220- 12:45.220* :  Like I dreamed of playing in front of these types of crowds
*12:45.220- 12:46.340* :  in these type of environments.
*12:46.840- 12:48.480* :  During every national anthem or every pregame,
*12:48.480- 12:50.420* :  like I just try to take a deep breath and look around
*12:50.420- 12:52.500* :  and, you know, soak in the environment
*12:52.500- 12:54.640* :  because it seriously never gets old.
*12:56.200- 12:58.840* :  Our sports reporter Sam Harris gave us his take
*12:58.840- 13:00.840* :  on her record-breaking achievement.
*13:01.740- 13:02.420* :  Oh, it's huge.
*13:02.440- 13:03.400* :  This is massive.
*13:03.400- 13:05.840* :  If we're talking college basketball
*13:05.840- 13:08.400* :  and for listeners who don't know basketball,
*13:08.400- 13:11.740* :  college basketball is massive in the US.
*13:11.740- 13:14.260* :  It is huge, especially the NCAA.
*13:14.920- 13:16.800* :  The cities come together over this.
*13:16.860- 13:17.920* :  Almost end.
*13:18.040- 13:20.220* :  There are millions that turn out
*13:20.240- 13:23.100* :  and want to watch their home city team play.
*13:23.780- 13:25.140* :  Caitlin's achievement is massive.
*13:25.200- 13:29.200* :  You can tell that by it hadn't been broken since 1970.
*13:29.240- 13:31.860* :  This is no small fee whatsoever.
*13:32.740- 13:35.380* :  And a huge amount of praise from athletes
*13:35.460- 13:36.560* :  and politicians alike.
*13:36.560- 13:37.740* :  Tell us more about the reaction.
*13:38.280- 13:40.020* :  Ah, the reaction was great.
*13:40.060- 13:42.240* :  Who wouldn't want to be congratulated
*13:42.340- 13:45.380* :  by arguably the greatest basketball athlete
*13:45.440- 13:47.080* :  of this generation, LeBron James?
*13:47.660- 13:49.940* :  He himself had just passed a record of
*13:50.220- 13:53.380* :  40,000 points in the NBA.
*13:53.380- 13:54.720* :  That's something special
*13:55.180- 13:57.280* :  and we might never see again.
*13:57.320- 13:59.940* :  So to have praise from someone like him
*14:00.140- 14:02.760* :  is second to none and, well, second to none
*14:02.760- 14:04.020* :  to the president, Joe Biden.
*14:04.440- 14:05.160* :  That's also not bad.
*14:05.160- 14:06.340* :  Is it extraordinary?
*14:06.340- 14:07.700* :  And for college basketball,
*14:07.700- 14:09.120* :  which, of course, let you say in the US,
*14:09.120- 14:12.380* :  big deal, perhaps here in the UK, not so much.
*14:12.500- 14:15.100* :  She's only 22 years old as well.
*14:15.100- 14:16.400* :  So a long career ahead.
*14:16.400- 14:20.380* :  What can we expect from Caitlin Clark in the future?
*14:20.860- 14:22.040* :  It's all up to Caitlin, really.
*14:22.200- 14:24.220* :  And the choice is she makes now going forward.
*14:24.680- 14:30.220* :  And hopefully we get to see the star rise of Caitlin
*14:30.220- 14:32.340* :  because she's already a star now.
*14:32.340- 14:34.880* :  And having phrases coined about
*14:35.120- 14:36.800* :  how big you're growing the women's game,
*14:36.800- 14:38.040* :  like the Caitlin effect.
*14:38.620- 14:39.340* :  That's pretty good.
*14:39.340- 14:40.380* :  Go in straight out the blocks.
*14:41.000- 14:41.480* :  Sam Harris.
*14:46.300- 14:47.680* :  Coming up in this podcast,
*14:47.680- 14:49.840* :  remember this from a few weeks ago.
*14:50.120- 14:51.800* :  We need help to find this monkey.
*14:54.920- 14:55.740* :  If you've heard him,
*14:56.060- 14:57.040* :  please give us a call.
*14:57.540- 14:58.840* :  Well, we have an update.
*15:07.980- 15:10.280* :  What stories would you like to share with your daughter?
*15:10.820- 15:13.960* :  What does she need to know to help her navigate her life ahead?
*15:14.720- 15:16.700* :  Dear daughter is the award-winning podcast
*15:16.700- 15:18.520* :  from the BBC World Service.
*15:18.960- 15:20.480* :  Full of thoughtful letters of advice,
*15:21.000- 15:21.740* :  personal stories,
*15:22.280- 15:24.320* :  and life lessons for daughters everywhere.
*15:24.960- 15:26.560* :  And it's back for a new series
*15:27.140- 15:30.040* :  with more of your letters and more fantastic guests.
*15:30.860- 15:32.020* :  Such for dear daughter,
*15:32.520- 15:34.360* :  wherever you get your BBC podcast.
*15:34.880- 15:35.700* :  Dear daughter.
*15:36.840- 15:39.220* :  Now to a story that proves the saying,
*15:39.220- 15:41.060* :  if at first you don't succeed.
*15:50.040- 15:53.720* :  This song, which is by a UK girl band called Zanana,
*15:54.120- 15:57.300* :  failed to chart when it was released nearly 40 years ago.
*15:57.860- 15:59.260* :  And now it's come back to life
*15:59.800- 16:02.980* :  after a young DJ found a copy in a second-hand shop.
*16:03.920- 16:05.560* :  The song gained a club following,
*16:05.560- 16:09.100* :  and now Zanana have landed a deal with a Dutch record label.
*16:09.680- 16:11.000* :  We've been hearing from the band,
*16:11.380- 16:12.760* :  Penny Griffiths, Ruth Elder,
*16:12.760- 16:14.760* :  and Anita Gabrielle Teder,
*16:15.140- 16:17.640* :  who at the time were in their teens and 20s
*16:17.920- 16:19.800* :  and are now in their 50s and 60s.
*16:19.900- 16:23.240* :  Two years ago, a young DJ called Keenan Abbott
*16:23.380- 16:25.140* :  was in a second-hand shop in Cornwall.
*16:25.300- 16:28.360* :  He found our record, and he really, really loved it.
*16:31.640- 16:33.220* :  He played it at gigs that he was doing.
*16:33.700- 16:35.300* :  He played it to friends who were into
*16:35.300- 16:38.680* :  synth pop music in Los Angeles and Berlin all over the world.
*16:39.000- 16:41.260* :  And quite by chance, we were at a party.
*16:41.660- 16:44.240* :  And for the first time in 37 years, was it girls?
*16:44.460- 16:47.100* :  We actually put the track on the old backing track on.
*16:47.100- 16:51.600* :  All the moves were there, the voices were there,
*16:51.600- 16:52.240* :  and the very next day,
*16:54.540- 16:55.760* :  Keenan, through Facebook, found his way to me and Anita.
*16:57.420- 16:57.560* :  And here we are, through a DJ,
*16:59.340- 16:59.620* :  doing another remix through another DJ,
*16:59.640- 17:01.340* :  getting this incredible deal.
*17:04.620- 17:06.260* :  So our range is fantastic.
*17:08.580- 17:09.580* :  That was what made us different back in the 80s
*17:09.580- 17:11.620* :  is that we were strong women right in our own music.
*17:11.620- 17:13.600* :  So it still stands up on its own music.
*17:13.600- 17:14.880* :  So it still stands up on its own music
*17:15.060- 17:18.120* :  so it still stands up on its own two feet today.
*17:22.620- 17:25.480* :  All three of us have been through so much in our lives
*17:25.480- 17:27.180* :  since there's an artist split up.
*17:27.500- 17:31.580* :  I think it just makes you, in life, really know what really matters
*17:31.960- 17:33.040* :  and what's really important.
*17:37.220- 17:38.640* :  To be honest, I was a little bit dubious.
*17:38.640- 17:40.920* :  I thought, oh, I don't know if we should be doing this at our age.
*17:40.960- 17:42.520* :  But Rosie and Penny said, oh, come on.
*17:42.620- 17:44.520* :  We lose. And that's the thing.
*17:44.820- 17:47.040* :  When you're younger, you worry about what people think.
*17:54.300- 17:55.740* :  But these days, I think, I'm going to be dead some time soon.
*17:57.200- 17:57.620* :  I might as well grab this.
*17:57.620- 18:01.460* :  You know, you'd never too old to do anything anymore.
*18:08.060- 18:09.600* :  The newly successful girl band, Zanana,
*18:10.220- 18:11.640* :  with their original 1980s track, Witches.
*18:13.720- 18:15.620* :  A woman in Wales has gone viral on TikTok
*18:15.620- 18:19.600* :  after CCTV footage showed her getting her coat caught
*18:19.600- 18:23.540* :  on a shopfront shutter and being hoisted in the air.
*18:24.140- 18:27.580* :  Anne Hughes, who's 72, is the talk of not only her village
*18:28.080- 18:28.780* :  but of the world.
*18:29.380- 18:31.600* :  After the video got more than two million views.
*18:32.520- 18:35.600* :  Our reporter, Andrew McNair, has been telling me all about this
*18:35.600- 18:37.580* :  rather uplifting story.
*18:38.320- 18:39.600* :  First things first, she is okay.
*18:39.640- 18:41.660* :  And being hoisted nearly three meters in the air,
*18:41.660- 18:43.460* :  it could have been anything but.
*18:43.460- 18:45.640* :  But Anne has been working as a cleaner
*18:45.640- 18:47.620* :  at this local convenience store for years.
*18:48.500- 18:51.600* :  And sort of being from this small village called Tontag
*18:51.600- 18:53.620* :  in South Wales, she probably wasn't expecting
*18:54.860- 18:55.620* :  overnight social media fame.
*18:56.560- 18:59.620* :  But the footage posted online has given her exactly that.
*18:59.920- 19:01.320* :  So here's what happened.
*19:01.580- 19:03.620* :  She was leaning up against the shutters with her trolley.
*19:04.840- 19:05.640* :  When the owner, unbeknownst to her,
*19:06.760- 19:07.600* :  starts to open the shop.
*19:08.300- 19:09.300* :  So he raises the shutters,
*19:09.520- 19:11.640* :  and she gets caught on one of the hooks on her coat.
*19:12.720- 19:13.540* :  The next thing she knows,
*19:13.680- 19:15.600* :  she's hoisted right up in the air and finds herself
*19:16.200- 19:17.640* :  dangling upside down from the waist.
*19:17.640- 19:18.580* :  Absolutely nothing she can do about it.
*19:18.880- 19:21.620* :  And it was all captured on CCTV.
*19:22.900- 19:23.640* :  Anne has been speaking to the BBC.
*19:24.660- 19:25.660* :  When Anne met his owner in the shop.
*19:27.080- 19:29.600* :  When he was inside, bringing the set as up.
*19:30.320- 19:31.340* :  My court had caught.
*19:32.080- 19:33.040* :  When I was going up.
*19:33.800- 19:35.340* :  And then I screamed his name.
*19:35.460- 19:37.340* :  And found goodness.
*19:38.160- 19:38.780* :  He kept mouth.
*19:39.160- 19:40.800* :  My cronchilla never asked me.
*19:41.620- 19:43.600* :  Why are you holding on to your trolley?
*19:44.360- 19:45.560* :  I said, I don't know.
*19:46.920- 19:47.500* :  Make no mistake.
*19:47.500- 19:49.020* :  It's a very funny video.
*19:49.560- 19:50.060* :  Big question.
*19:50.060- 19:52.460* :  Was Anne ready for this level of online fame?
*19:53.140- 19:55.000* :  Well, she must have been absolutely terrified.
*19:55.000- 19:57.600* :  But her and her family have had a right laugh at this,
*19:58.040- 19:59.100* :  as you might imagine.
*19:59.680- 20:00.580* :  And as we've heard,
*20:00.880- 20:03.120* :  the thing that's gotten many people talking
*20:03.120- 20:05.420* :  is the fact that she was grabbing hold of her trolley.
*20:06.080- 20:07.620* :  And held on to her as she was dangling there.
*20:07.620- 20:11.320* :  So her friends think that she looked ridiculous all round.
*20:11.320- 20:12.640* :  Here's Wendy Barrett.
*20:12.760- 20:13.540* :  It's hysterical.
*20:16.240- 20:17.620* :  I've known Anne for years.
*20:17.680- 20:19.600* :  She's a very good friend of mine.
*20:21.040- 20:21.620* :  And just to see her.
*20:21.620- 20:22.660* :  Well, it made my day yesterday.
*20:22.660- 20:25.540* :  And for the shop owner, Anne Meds.
*20:27.200- 20:27.640* :  It's possibly the best marketing campaign
*20:28.220- 20:29.600* :  that a local shop has ever had.
*20:29.700- 20:30.580* :  I'm sorry, because she made it out alive.
*20:31.280- 20:32.100* :  Andrew McNair.
*20:32.760- 20:34.600* :  Earlier in the happy pod, we were talking about
*20:34.620- 20:36.500* :  rare and unusual languages.
*20:36.980- 20:38.960* :  Australia used to be one of the most
*20:38.960- 20:40.840* :  linguistically diverse places
*20:41.300- 20:43.040* :  with over 200 languages.
*20:43.620- 20:46.900* :  But today, many of them are considered highly endangered.
*20:47.520- 20:48.960* :  Enter Gillad Zuckerman,
*20:49.340- 20:51.380* :  a Hebrew-speaking linguistics professor
*20:51.880- 20:52.600* :  who's on a mission
*20:52.620- 20:54.240* :  to help indigenous communities
*20:54.620- 20:56.240* :  reclaim their mother tongues.
*20:56.820- 20:59.300* :  Gillad has painstakingly pieced back together
*20:59.620- 21:01.420* :  the dormant language of Bangala,
*21:01.780- 21:03.520* :  which was spoken in South Australia
*21:04.200- 21:05.340* :  before presenting his work
*21:05.340- 21:07.600* :  to the indigenous community for approval.
*21:08.200- 21:09.600* :  Among them, Shania Richards.
*21:10.740- 21:11.620* :  So where did Gillad begin?
*21:12.880- 21:17.480* :  I had a dictionary written in 1844
*21:17.480- 21:21.600* :  with up to 3,500 words,
*21:22.320- 21:22.940* :  which is a lot.
*21:24.160- 21:27.280* :  He reveled in the delights of this language.
*21:28.740- 21:29.020* :  Wari.
*21:30.180- 21:31.600* :  Numi Di Gamangudu.
*21:32.520- 21:35.100* :  Gillad refers to Bangala as a sleeping beauty.
*21:35.600- 21:37.580* :  So I asked five representatives
*21:38.220- 21:39.680* :  of the Bangala tribe to come to my office.
*21:40.840- 21:43.600* :  And I told these five Bangala representatives
*21:45.320- 21:47.620* :  I have found enough material
*21:49.700- 21:51.640* :  to reclaim your dreaming sleeping beauty.
*21:54.440- 21:55.180* :  Are you interested?
*21:56.440- 21:59.380* :  Their response changed my life
*21:59.380- 22:00.700* :  because they told me,
*22:00.700- 22:01.360* :  and I quote,
*22:02.680- 22:05.320* :  we have been waiting for you for 50 years.
*22:08.780- 22:09.540* :  The weight was over.
*22:10.300- 22:11.520* :  Just a few months later
*22:11.660- 22:13.560* :  they planned the first language workshop
*22:13.740- 22:15.540* :  with Gillad and members of the community.
*22:16.420- 22:17.300* :  The entire night
*22:17.900- 22:19.600* :  I was working like a dog
*22:20.860- 22:21.560* :  preparing songs,
*22:22.220- 22:23.600* :  including the head-shoulders
*22:23.600- 22:25.360* :  knees and toes in Bangala.
*22:26.020- 22:28.960* :  Gagawiri Bura Idna Bura Idna.
*22:29.560- 22:33.020* :  Gagawiri Bura Idna Bura Idna.
*22:35.240- 22:35.600* :  Gillad's approach
*22:35.600- 22:37.600* :  is for the community to be in charge
*22:37.600- 22:39.260* :  of the revival of their language.
*22:39.840- 22:41.240* :  I need to make it clear
*22:42.100- 22:43.520* :  the Aboriginal people
*22:43.560- 22:45.560* :  are at the wheel.
*22:46.940- 22:47.600* :  They're the ones
*22:48.900- 22:51.500* :  who have to approve of any decision
*22:51.840- 22:52.580* :  that I make.
*22:52.620- 22:54.320* :  In fact, I don't make decisions.
*22:54.620- 22:56.120* :  I make recommendations.
*22:59.000- 23:00.780* :  I remember like the first time I met
*23:00.780- 23:01.680* :  Professor Gillad.
*23:02.620- 23:05.680* :  He was the one that really helped us
*23:06.180- 23:07.600* :  with a language revival.
*23:07.720- 23:09.600* :  When Chenaya was a teenager
*23:09.860- 23:11.600* :  and struggling with her mental health
*23:11.620- 23:13.700* :  she went to a newly set up
*23:13.700- 23:14.600* :  Bangala Community Centre.
*23:14.620- 23:16.560* :  It was like he was one of those heroes
*23:17.120- 23:19.140* :  from the books that came around
*23:19.140- 23:20.600* :  they were like, hey, you know you're
*23:20.620- 23:21.580* :  allowed to be yourself?
*23:22.620- 23:24.160* :  She went to a Bangala language workshop
*23:24.620- 23:25.800* :  learning songs in the language
*23:28.660- 23:29.600* :  and reading books.
*23:31.060- 23:31.660* :  It was like he understood
*23:32.960- 23:33.600* :  and he saw how much we needed
*23:33.640- 23:34.440* :  to find this so that we can find ourselves again
*23:34.620- 23:35.960* :  not only just as individuals
*23:36.620- 23:37.200* :  but as a collective
*23:38.680- 23:41.280* :  and hopefully for the whole community.
*23:42.560- 23:43.600* :  For Chenaya there's no question
*23:43.600- 23:44.660* :  about the impact it's had for her.
*23:45.060- 23:46.260* :  To find my people again
*23:46.620- 23:47.800* :  my culture and my language
*23:48.280- 23:49.100* :  is literally like
*23:49.900- 23:51.900* :  I found myself through language again
*23:52.400- 23:54.020* :  because now I feel like I have a purpose
*23:54.560- 23:56.020* :  even if it's as simple as
*23:56.020- 23:58.100* :  being able to learn a new
*23:58.100- 23:59.420* :  bungalow word per day.
*24:00.040- 24:01.860* :  Chenaya has come a really long way
*24:01.860- 24:02.940* :  since she was a teenager
*24:03.680- 24:05.420* :  and she's now an elected politician
*24:08.600- 24:08.660* :  in the region.
*24:08.660- 24:10.620* :  She's also writing a book
*24:10.620- 24:11.760* :  of Bangala poems
*24:12.920- 24:14.220* :  but for Chenaya the biggest
*24:14.220- 24:15.800* :  difference is in how she sees
*24:18.600- 24:18.620* :  herself.
*24:18.620- 24:19.620* :  I never used to be able to look at myself
*24:19.620- 24:21.080* :  in the mirror and now
*24:21.680- 24:23.240* :  I look in the mirror and now
*24:23.620- 24:24.580* :  I actually like what I see.
*24:25.620- 24:26.400* :  I see me smiling.
*24:27.660- 24:29.520* :  I see my beautiful skin.
*24:30.260- 24:32.600* :  I see my beautiful curly hair
*24:33.140- 24:34.600* :  and yeah that has been a real
*24:36.140- 24:36.200* :  transformation for me.
*24:36.620- 24:38.180* :  To now actually being the person
*24:38.180- 24:38.800* :  I've always dreamed of becoming.

*24:55.980- 24:56.600* :  we told you about the adventures
*24:57.040- 24:57.820* :  of an escaped monkey in Scotland.
*24:57.940- 25:00.600* :  Honshu, a Japanese snow monkey
*25:01.060- 25:02.620* :  escaped from a wildlife park
*25:03.980- 25:04.620* :  in the Scottish Highlands
*25:05.260- 25:06.620* :  and became the subject of a
*25:07.080- 25:07.580* :  major search operation involving
*25:08.840- 25:09.480* :  the town.
*25:09.620- 25:11.120* :  But his story did not end there
*25:11.620- 25:12.140* :  with a recap.
*25:16.600- 25:16.680* :  And an important update
*25:16.800- 25:18.280* :  here's Kalam Leslie.
*25:20.580- 25:20.600* :  Hello.
*25:22.560- 25:22.700* :  This is the story of the Scottish
*25:23.940- 25:23.960* :  Macak.
*25:26.140- 25:26.640* :  At the Highland Wildlife Park
*25:28.060- 25:28.520* :  up near King Craig.
*25:29.660- 25:30.480* :  An adventurous monkey
*25:30.880- 25:31.460* :  had an exciting few days.
*25:32.540- 25:34.240* :  His name was Honshu, a Japanese
*25:35.040- 25:35.140* :  Macak.
*25:36.820- 25:38.640* :  Sometimes like a scrap.
*25:40.040- 25:40.580* :  Which can leave
*25:40.880- 25:42.160* :  knees bloody and make
*25:42.160- 25:42.960* :  eyes black.
*25:43.620- 25:45.520* :  But Honshu didn't really fit in.
*25:45.620- 25:46.800* :  He was a sensitive soul.
*25:50.600- 25:50.680* :  He preferred reading books
*25:50.900- 25:51.940* :  or listening to music on his own.
*25:53.000- 25:54.620* :  It all got too much
*25:56.460- 25:56.540* :  when one fateful night
*25:56.540- 25:58.520* :  he got fed up of his
*25:58.580- 26:00.160* :  troop after a really big fight.
*26:01.740- 26:02.640* :  So he hopped to fence
*26:02.760- 26:03.300* :  and channeled William Wallace
*26:04.500- 26:05.380* :  and his heart was racing.
*26:05.680- 26:06.700* :  But he found he wasn't
*26:09.160- 26:09.760* :  all that scared.
*26:12.160- 26:12.600* :  He was curious and excited
*26:13.520- 26:14.100* :  about the big world out there.
*26:16.100- 26:16.620* :  The Highlands were beautiful.
*26:16.620- 26:18.600* :  The Keren Gurms stopped him
*26:18.600- 26:19.160* :  in his tracks.
*26:21.900- 26:22.620* :  He decided right then
*26:22.620- 26:23.320* :  that he wasn't Japanese anymore.
*26:23.620- 26:26.520* :  Now he was a Scottish Macak.
*26:26.520- 26:27.660* :  He wanted to see Ben Nevis
*26:28.540- 26:30.620* :  and Loch Ness too.
*26:31.520- 26:32.480* :  He wanted to eat a tattoo
*26:32.480- 26:33.680* :  of the Scottish monkey
*26:33.680- 26:34.980* :  on the loose from the zoo.
*26:35.980- 26:36.880* :  He popped up in gardens.
*26:37.620- 26:38.700* :  In we Scottish towns
*26:42.600- 26:42.720* :  and was having a great time
*26:42.720- 26:43.440* :  cutting around.
*26:45.540- 26:46.600* :  But the people at the wildlife park
*26:47.680- 26:48.540* :  wanted him to come home.
*26:50.040- 26:50.620* :  The Scotland in February was too cold
*26:50.620- 26:52.420* :  for him to be on his own.
*26:53.080- 26:54.460* :  They were worried about Honshu
*26:55.360- 26:56.420* :  and hoped he'd come back.
*26:57.160- 26:58.280* :  And a man named Ben
*26:58.280- 27:00.620* :  searched with drones and made monkey maps.
*27:00.620- 27:01.580* :  He ordered in eating yorkshire poods
*27:02.200- 27:03.140* :  and the adventure was over.
*27:03.840- 27:04.740* :  But not quite for good.
*27:05.740- 27:06.820* :  He went back to the park.
*27:07.620- 27:08.840* :  But things stayed the same.
*27:09.640- 27:11.200* :  The other Macak didn't let him join in
*27:11.620- 27:12.360* :  in their monkey games.
*27:16.600- 27:16.720* :  So the people at the park
*27:16.760- 27:18.640* :  they came up with a plan
*27:18.640- 27:19.540* :  to make him much more happy
*27:20.520- 27:22.600* :  so he wouldn't want to run away again.
*27:24.260- 27:24.580* :  They asked him if he'd like to go
*27:24.580- 27:25.800* :  to Edinburgh Zoo.
*27:28.200- 27:28.600* :  He thought for a moment
*27:28.600- 27:28.860* :  that many remembered
*27:29.620- 27:31.160* :  how he felt on that fateful night.
*27:31.900- 27:33.000* :  And how things that seemed
*27:33.620- 27:34.280* :  at first scary
*27:36.940- 27:38.620* :  can still be alright.
*27:39.580- 27:40.600* :  So he plucked up his courage
*27:42.000- 27:42.380* :  and said he would go.
*27:42.380- 27:44.500* :  He was excited about new places
*27:45.780- 27:46.600* :  to see new things to know.
*27:47.020- 27:48.080* :  And as it turns out
*27:48.120- 27:49.880* :  everyone was excited to see him too.
*27:51.340- 27:52.600* :  And people came from all around
*27:54.160- 27:54.640* :  to visit him at the zoo.
*27:55.900- 27:56.560* :  He hoped he could see more of Scotland
*27:56.560- 27:57.680* :  than he had to watch Livingston play.
*27:58.180- 27:59.260* :  Get a big bag of chips
*27:59.620- 28:00.620* :  from Karen Fishbar.
*28:01.620- 28:02.440* :  Play golfers and Andrews
*28:03.620- 28:04.000* :  and try to break apart.
*28:08.600- 28:08.700* :  So this is a story
*28:08.980- 28:10.020* :  for anyone who thinks they don't fit in.
*28:11.800- 28:12.640* :  Maybe you're just waiting
*28:12.860- 28:14.600* :  for your adventure to begin.
*28:16.280- 28:16.600* :  There are people out there
*28:17.000- 28:18.620* :  who will appreciate you
*28:19.740- 28:19.860* :  for you.
*28:22.460- 28:22.540* :  Just like they're aware
*28:23.000- 28:23.760* :  for the Scottish Macak.
*28:24.740- 28:25.120* :  Firstly, we love it
