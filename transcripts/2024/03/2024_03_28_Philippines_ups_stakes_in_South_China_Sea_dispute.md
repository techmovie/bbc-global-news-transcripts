*00:24.020- 00:27.240* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:29.180- 00:34.300* :  I'm Janet Gillil and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 28th of March, these are our main stories.
*00:35.040- 00:40.340* :  The Filipino President promises countermeasures over what he describes as China's dangerous
*00:40.340- 00:47.120* :  attacks in the South China Sea. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has been raging around at least
*00:47.120- 00:54.400* :  three hospitals in Gaza. Colombia expels Argentine diplomats after President Javier Muley
*00:54.400- 00:56.860* :  calls his Colombian counterpart a murderer.
*00:59.920- 01:04.520* :  Also in this podcast we really need to be doing more for people affected by motornearing disease
*01:04.660- 01:09.320* :  and you know the earlier we intervened the more likely we are to be successful with therapies.
*01:10.280- 01:13.300* :  A new test that could detect early signs of the disease.
*01:18.440- 01:22.620* :  China and the Philippines have long been at loggerheads over the South China Sea,
*01:22.620- 01:27.620* :  but after recent confrontations in which Filipino troops have been injured and vessels damaged,
*01:27.620- 01:32.600* :  the President of the Philippines has said his country will not be cowed into silence.
*01:33.340- 01:36.420* :  In what seems to be a further escalation of their dispute,
*01:36.420- 01:40.780* :  Ferdinand Marcos Jr pledged to take countermeasures against Beijing.
*01:41.620- 01:46.920* :  China which claims almost the entire sea as its own responded by suggesting the Philippines
*01:46.920- 01:52.740* :  is to blame for the tensions. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused Manila of
*01:52.740- 02:01.420* :  hypocrisy. Who's been stirring up trouble and causing provocation on the South China Sea issue?
*02:01.420- 02:06.040* :  Who's been breaching the common understanding between our two countries and reneged on their
*02:06.040- 02:11.780* :  own commitments? Who's been staging a show and helping up tensions? Who's been pulling forces
*02:11.780- 02:14.340* :  from outside the region to interfere in the issue?
*02:15.200- 02:19.840* :  Asia Pacific Ericsor Mickey Bristol told us what was known about the Filipino President's
*02:19.840- 02:25.200* :  threat to China? Ferdinand Marcos Jr didn't actually say in his statements about
*02:25.980- 02:30.800* :  these package of countermeasures he was going to impose, but certainly it raises the possibility
*02:30.800- 02:37.780* :  of further tension and drawing in importantly, in drawing in the United States because the U.S.
*02:37.780- 02:44.100* :  is a treaty ally of the Philippines and promised to help it and in fact Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
*02:45.080- 02:52.360* :  been in consultation with his allies and they had offered to help essentially this dispute
*02:52.360- 02:57.260* :  is set centers around the second Thomas Show where the Philippines has run a ground
*02:57.260- 03:02.520* :  of vessel and has stationed a number of troops over recent months as it has done for the last
*03:02.520- 03:07.820* :  two decades it's been trying to resupply the troops there and China has been trying to stop
*03:07.820- 03:13.880* :  these resupply vessels by either getting in front of the Philippine ships or firing water
*03:13.880- 03:18.680* :  cannon at the moon and recently laying out a barrier to stop them getting near the boat so
*03:19.260- 03:24.220* :  this is what Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is responding to and as I said the potential now is that
*03:24.640- 03:28.220* :  that all those people have been watching this have been wondering who's going to blink first
*03:28.660- 03:32.340* :  who's going to sweat and increase the action and it's Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
*03:33.500- 03:37.640* :  Mickey Bristol, well, China's relations of the Philippines may have worsened but Beijing
*03:37.640- 03:42.280* :  appears keener than ever to improve its previously fractious relationship with Australia.
*03:42.920- 03:46.340* :  China has just announced it will remove tariffs on Australian wine.
*03:46.820- 03:50.880* :  The tariffs were imposed four years ago following Canberra's call for an investigation
*03:50.920- 03:57.540* :  to the origins of COVID-19. So why the change of heart? Here's our China correspondent Laura Bicker.
*03:58.340- 04:05.740* :  China imposed tariffs of up to 200% on Australian wine in 2020. After the then Australian Prime
*04:05.740- 04:11.680* :  Minister called for an objective independent assessment of how the COVID-19 pandemic began.
*04:12.480- 04:18.700* :  It cost suppliers an estimated $1.2 billion Australian dollars and left them with the
*04:18.700- 04:25.840* :  equivalent of 859 Olympic swimming pools of wine in storage. Today's announcement follows a
*04:25.840- 04:30.680* :  series of meetings between the two nations after a change in the Australian government.
*04:30.700- 04:36.920* :  In November the new Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, became the first Australian Premier to
*04:36.920- 04:43.780* :  visit Beijing since 2016. He said then that it was in the interests of both countries to stabilize
*04:43.780- 04:50.160* :  the relationship. Laura Bicker, there has been heavy fighting around several hospitals in Gaza,
*04:50.160- 04:55.940* :  even as medical staff-worn conditions are already catastrophic for patients and displaced people
*04:55.940- 05:00.960* :  who've sought refuge. Israel says Hamas fighters are using the sites as their bases.
*05:01.660- 05:07.760* :  Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has been under siege for 11 days, with Israeli forces
*05:07.980- 05:12.100* :  reporting that they've killed or captured hundreds of Palestinian militants.
*05:12.700- 05:18.280* :  Dina Abushaban lives near the hospital. Her family was forced to evacuate before it was bombed.
*05:18.900- 05:25.520* :  When the tanks suddenly came in, there was heavy firing, so we got scared and opened the windows
*05:25.520- 05:30.320* :  and saw the Israeli army within our area and the maternity unit of the hospital.
*05:30.900- 05:36.080* :  There is constant bombardment from all areas. We're tired because we hear people screaming
*05:36.100- 05:40.460* :  and we hear the speakers at night broadcasting to people to evacuate.
*05:41.460- 05:46.420* :  This all comes as even Israel's closest allies have expressed concern over the vast
*05:46.420- 05:52.040* :  loss of life, the widespread destruction and the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza,
*05:52.580- 05:57.120* :  where people are now starving to death. A correspondent in Jerusalem, Yolanda Nell,
*05:57.120- 06:00.120* :  his following developments, she told us more about the latest fighting.
*06:00.740- 06:05.260* :  It's particularly concentrated to the Israeli military operations in Gaza City,
*06:05.260- 06:09.760* :  around the Shifa Hospital where you've had a raid going on there for 11 days now,
*06:10.260- 06:15.940* :  and also in the very south of the Gaza Strip in Harnunis, where you have two big hospitals
*06:15.940- 06:20.700* :  that are affected there. So this is all having a major knock-on effect on health care.
*06:21.100- 06:24.600* :  If you look at the Shifa Hospital first of all, you've got the Israeli military saying that it
*06:24.600- 06:29.900* :  has managed to kill dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters since it moved back in there,
*06:30.320- 06:35.040* :  but according to officials in the Hamas-eraan health ministry, you have doctors and patients
*06:35.040- 06:39.400* :  who are caught up in all of this. They're now confined in a sort of administrative building
*06:39.400- 06:43.080* :  inside the hospital. They're asking for international help to get them out.
*06:43.460- 06:49.380* :  The Israeli military says that it is providing those medical teams with support, with food,
*06:49.380- 06:53.720* :  with water, and has given them a place to carry out treatment. It says it's carrying out
*06:53.720- 06:58.340* :  precise actions around the hospital and taking steps not to harm innocent civilians.
*06:58.340- 07:03.640* :  It says similar things about what's been happening around hospitals in the south. The Al-Alam al-Hospital
*07:03.640- 07:09.040* :  is now basically closed off. It's been evacuated as Israeli troops moved back into that area,
*07:09.420- 07:14.580* :  and also in Harnunis nearby at the Nasser Hospital. We're now being told that Israeli tanks and
*07:14.780- 07:18.760* :  armored vehicles have moved back into that area. We're not hearing about a raid on that hospital yet,
*07:18.760- 07:24.780* :  but it's really raised fears about the people said to number thousands who are inside.
*07:24.780- 07:28.980* :  So your overall left with the situation where you've got fewer and fewer hospitals that are
*07:28.980- 07:35.360* :  able to function even partially. Your land now. As you record this podcast, a New York judge
*07:35.360- 07:40.220* :  is about to rule on what sentence the perpetrator of what's being called one of the biggest
*07:40.220- 07:45.560* :  financial crimes in US history should get. Sam Bankman-Freed, who founded the cryptocurrency
*07:45.560- 07:52.200* :  exchange FTX, was found guilty of fraud and money laundering last year. The former billionaire CEO
*07:52.200- 07:57.860* :  potentially faces decades in prison for fraud and conspiracy charges stemming from his role
*07:57.860- 08:04.220* :  in a massive collapse of FTX. His legal team have called for leniency, but prosecutors are seeking
*08:04.220- 08:10.460* :  40 to 50 years in prison. As we wait for that sentence, I've been speaking to our cyber correspondent
*08:10.460- 08:16.300* :  Joe Tidey, who interviewed Sam Bankman-Freed just before his arrest in December 2022.
*08:17.080- 08:21.960* :  It was in this really bizarre period. After the empire had collapsed, this $32 billion
*08:21.960- 08:27.520* :  empire, he was top of the pile one of big influencers in crypto. It all came crashing down in eight days,
*08:28.440- 08:33.080* :  and we all expected any minute now that he was going to be arrested and he was sort of hiding out
*08:33.080- 08:37.480* :  in his luxury apartment in the Bahamas and he started accepting requests from reporters to go
*08:37.480- 08:42.420* :  and interview him. We went there and we had this very bizarre 45 minute interview where there
*08:42.960- 08:47.200* :  were no questions off the table, no time limit. He answered everything and took it all on the
*08:47.200- 08:53.240* :  chin in the sense. It was a strange thing where he sort of self-flagulation for him. Of course,
*08:53.240- 08:58.160* :  we were channeling the energy of the million or so customers who were out of pocket. All along,
*08:58.160- 09:02.780* :  he was saying, yes, I made really bad business mistakes, but none of it was deliberate and none
*09:02.780- 09:07.240* :  of it was criminal. He was saying and he seemed to be convinced he wouldn't be arrested and he
*09:07.240- 09:11.760* :  wouldn't be convicted. But now, of course, he's about to sentenced. Yes, so he was convicted of
*09:11.760- 09:16.740* :  fraud money laundering. What about those customers? Did they recoup their money? Not yet. No,
*09:16.740- 09:20.060* :  they're still out of pocket and they're still waiting and there's a big campaign from them
*09:20.540- 09:24.700* :  to try and get a bit more than they're being promised. They're being told at the moment that
*09:25.120- 09:29.400* :  enough of the $8 billion that went missing has been recovered now that they can claim back about
*09:29.400- 09:35.040* :  90% of what they lost. However, that sounds good, doesn't it? However, of course, they're getting back
*09:35.040- 09:40.620* :  the dollar value of what they had in the FTX exchange at the time and the FTX exchange allowed
*09:40.620- 09:46.340* :  you to use your dollars and your pounds to exchange that for Bitcoin or Ethereum or any of the other
*09:46.340- 09:51.320* :  cryptocurrencies. Of course, now that cryptocurrency has gone through the roof. It's four times
*09:51.320- 09:56.120* :  worth the value of what it was when it all collapsed. They're very upset at the loss of, I think they're
*09:56.120- 10:01.860* :  calling it the loss of potential earnings. That's just absolutely devastating for them. At the same
*10:01.860- 10:08.340* :  time, though, this doesn't seem to have dampened enthusiasm for cryptocurrency. As you say, Bitcoin
*10:08.340- 10:12.920* :  is that a record high? Yeah, well, interestingly, when the collapse happened, and it's partly because
*10:12.920- 10:17.360* :  of the kind of wider market that meant that it collapsed. But if you look at the value of Bitcoin,
*10:17.360- 10:21.520* :  this green line that everyone studies in the crypto world, which is kind of the barometer for the
*10:21.520- 10:27.540* :  health and interest in the industry, you can see a little drop where Sandbackman Fried, where FTX
*10:27.540- 10:31.780* :  collapsed, and then it stayed in what they call a crypto winter, where no one was interested.
*10:31.780- 10:35.900* :  People were pulling their money out. The value was low about $16,000 for one Bitcoin.
*10:35.900- 10:40.800* :  And then slowly last year, we started to see it tick up a little bit and it got higher and higher.
*10:41.240- 10:44.880* :  And then about three or four weeks ago, it just went through the roof and we're seeing record
*10:45.520- 10:51.000* :  broken almost daily now with new highs of the value of Bitcoin because of what's happening in the
*10:51.000- 10:58.080* :  U.S. with U.S. financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, pouring money into Bitcoin
*10:58.080- 11:01.920* :  because they're now allowed to because they got given permission by the U.S. authorities.
*11:02.440- 11:05.260* :  And there's a few other things happening in the world of crypto, which is getting people very
*11:05.260- 11:09.760* :  excited. But you're right, it is through the roof and it seems stronger than ever, despite coming
*11:09.760- 11:13.460* :  through this horrendous scandal that we're now seeing the conclusion of.
*11:14.660- 11:20.960* :  Joe Tidey. Johnny Kitagawa was Japan's most famous pop manager until his death in 2019.
*11:21.680- 11:26.180* :  This despite longstanding allegations that he sexually exploited some of the thousands of
*11:26.180- 11:30.940* :  boys and young men who he came into contact with during the course of his 60-year career.
*11:31.820- 11:36.440* :  Now the man tasked with arranging compensation for the victims has told the BBC that he believes
*11:36.760- 11:40.820* :  two other men at Kitagawa's company were also sexual predators.
*11:41.620- 11:43.640* :  Mobine Azar is following the story.
*11:48.500- 11:53.080* :  Johnny Kitagawa was a hitmaker. He held a world record for the most number one
*11:53.080- 11:58.480* :  artist produced by an individual. Though after our BBC investigation, his child abuse was a
*11:58.480- 12:06.340* :  scandal the country could no longer ignore. It's mainstream media reported the story for the first
*12:06.340- 12:13.180* :  time and the United Nations even investigated the company. His CEO, Judy Fujishima, resigned.
*12:18.060- 12:23.360* :  The company dissolved and a new one called Smile Up was set up to process the claims of abuse.
*12:24.320- 12:29.740* :  I've come back to Japan for the first time in over a year to meet survivors and see how things
*12:29.740- 12:39.400* :  have changed. Akimasa is a former aspiring pop star and a survivor of Kitagawa's abuse.
*12:40.160- 12:49.040* :  It was huge that the CEO admitted that the sexual assault happened. At the same time I feel like
*12:49.040- 12:56.640* :  there's still some issues that are hidden. And he alleges that the abuse was even more widespread.
*12:57.480- 13:05.220* :  There was a report that says there were some staff members were sexually abusing the boy talent as well.
*13:06.060- 13:12.200* :  I took these allegations to Noriyuku Higashiyama, the CEO of the renamed company Smile Up,
*13:12.580- 13:18.320* :  and what is his first ever interview since starting the job. We've spoken to a former
*13:18.320- 13:27.500* :  junior who has said that they are aware of abuse at the hands of another member of staff.
*13:28.140- 13:31.640* :  In addition to Johnny Kitagawa, are you aware of those allegations?
*13:33.420- 13:38.260* :  I've heard there are two people. Isn't that information that you should be
*13:38.380- 13:45.320* :  handing over to the police? From a legal standpoint, I don't think we have the
*13:45.320- 13:50.920* :  authority to do that. But if those involved file a criminal complaint, I imagine we would
*13:50.920- 13:55.740* :  cooperate as much as possible. Morally, wouldn't it be the right thing to do?
*13:58.140- 14:05.100* :  To be honest, I don't know what the answer is. What is the right end result? What do the survivors want?
*14:07.600- 14:12.360* :  Smile Up has received criticism from victims for its handling of the compensation process.
*14:13.020- 14:17.040* :  Days after being set up, it released the statement suggesting that some of the allegations
*14:17.040- 14:22.480* :  were telling what they call false stories using the testimonies of real victims.
*14:22.540- 14:27.040* :  The CEO has defended the statement that he discourages online abuse.
*14:27.800- 14:32.280* :  For some of the survivors, they believe this statement caused them to face online harassment.
*14:32.280- 14:38.860* :  For one man, the abuse was so severe that it led him to take his own life, I spoke to his widow.
*14:42.340- 14:44.940* :  It was from that point that the online attacks increased.
*14:45.660- 14:52.100* :  It's a fraud, it just wants money, it was saying, so your fault, as it received more online
*14:52.100- 14:58.540* :  abuse, it looked depressed. Information about our child was posted, it was like the whole family was
*14:58.540- 15:05.940* :  being attacked. Smile Up told us their victim relief committee and counsellors both contacted him twice,
*15:05.940- 15:10.120* :  but it's unclear when this happened. Mobine Azar reporting.
*15:12.640- 15:14.160* :  Still to come in the global news podcast?
*15:14.740- 15:23.100* :  He has terrible tusks and terrible claws and terrible teeth in his territory.

*15:37.180- 15:41.240* :  And what are different countries around the world getting right in order for women to live well

*15:46.100- 15:49.960* :  women are living their best lives and what the rest of the world could learn from them.
*15:50.400- 15:54.340* :  In my award-winning podcast, dear daughter is back for a new season.

*16:48.280- 16:52.080* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

*17:11.600- 17:13.500* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*17:14.380- 17:16.540* :  A murdering terrorist, a communist.
*17:16.540- 17:20.740* :  It's not the kind of language you would expect one world leader to use about another,
*17:20.740- 17:23.800* :  but that was how the Argentine President, Habier Milley,
*17:23.800- 17:29.440* :  described his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro in a recent interview with the news channel CNN.
*17:30.360- 17:35.140* :  Unsurprisingly, Colombia has reacted by expelling Argentine diplomats.
*17:35.820- 17:41.000* :  BBC News Online's Latin America editor, Vanessa Baschluta, told us more about what Argentinian
*17:41.000- 17:45.480* :  is what our president said in the interview, which is to be aired in full in the coming days.
*18:10.460- 18:13.900* :  Someone who has been a murdering terrorist, right? He's a communist.
*18:14.600- 18:21.220* :  So what he's referring to is the fact that Gustavo Petro was a member of the M19 rebel group
*18:21.220- 18:25.820* :  in the 1980s, and that urban guerrilla group, a left-wing guerrilla group,
*18:26.320- 18:31.520* :  did take part in the siege of the Justice Palace in Colombia in which many people died,
*18:31.520- 18:35.380* :  but it has to be stressed that Gustavo Petro, who's now a president,
*18:35.380- 18:39.240* :  at the time was in prison. He did not take part in that siege.
*18:39.740- 18:42.960* :  And Colombia is saying he was democratically elected.
*18:44.040- 18:48.660* :  What is the thinking behind these very extreme statements by the Argentine President?
*18:49.520- 18:52.180* :  Well, look, Habier Milley is famous,
*18:52.780- 18:57.260* :  slash infamous for attacking people, and for using very, very colorful language.
*18:57.260- 19:02.740* :  He is always swearing, and he's made a career out of attacking other leaders,
*19:02.980- 19:06.460* :  and it also has to be seen in the context of Latin America and politics,
*19:06.460- 19:10.080* :  where personal attacks are the norm, sadly.
*19:10.660- 19:17.060* :  And Mr. Milley hasn't just attacked other presidents in this particular interview.
*19:17.060- 19:21.260* :  He also called the president of Mexico an ignorant man,
*19:21.980- 19:25.140* :  but to the shock of everyone during the presidential campaign,
*19:25.140- 19:29.720* :  which of course he then went on to win, Mr. Milley also attacked the Pope,
*19:30.120- 19:35.220* :  his fellow Argentine citizen, and called him a communist,
*19:35.220- 19:41.100* :  and somebody who brought about evil on earth, which of course, the Pope,
*19:41.160- 19:46.080* :  I mean, you know, extremely pointing him with evil is just quite out there.
*19:46.300- 19:51.280* :  So this is a very serious diplomatic incident between Argentina and Colombia.
*19:51.280- 19:55.160* :  Relations are already very difficult between them. What happens now?
*19:56.300- 20:00.240* :  We don't know how many Argentine diplomats are going to be expelled.
*20:00.240- 20:03.860* :  Colombia hasn't given us a number, they haven't given us names.
*20:03.920- 20:07.800* :  However, it also has to be said that in the past,
*20:08.140- 20:10.380* :  Milley has made up with people he's insulted.
*20:10.380- 20:12.000* :  So in the case of the Pope, for example,
*20:12.000- 20:16.160* :  they hugged it out a few weeks ago and joked about it,
*20:16.160- 20:19.880* :  and he's since said that he's revising his views on the Pope,
*20:19.880- 20:21.820* :  so the same might happen with the Colombian president.
*20:22.800- 20:24.000* :  Vanessa Bushluter.
*20:25.240- 20:27.860* :  It's been described as a game changer by scientists,
*20:27.860- 20:31.340* :  a test that can detect signs of motor neuron disease
*20:31.880- 20:33.280* :  before symptoms appear.
*20:34.020- 20:37.780* :  Motor neuron disease is an incurable condition that affects the brain and nerves,
*20:37.780- 20:40.440* :  causes muscle weakness that gets worse over time,
*20:40.980- 20:43.000* :  and can cause premature death.
*20:43.420- 20:47.560* :  The researchers say identifying the disease early could help to make treatments
*20:47.560- 20:48.700* :  more effective.
*20:49.380- 20:53.420* :  Dr. Jenna Gregory from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland was part of the study
*20:53.840- 20:55.180* :  and told us more about the findings.
*20:56.040- 20:58.820* :  The most striking thing that I find about motor neuron diseases,
*20:58.820- 21:03.080* :  everybody really has a completely different experience of a disease process,
*21:03.080- 21:06.400* :  so people experience different symptom combinations of symptoms
*21:06.460- 21:10.720* :  and disease progression, and that actually makes it really difficult for us as
*21:10.720- 21:12.940* :  clinicians to be able to diagnose the disease,
*21:12.940- 21:15.900* :  particularly in those really early stages of the disease process.
*21:16.540- 21:19.700* :  But despite this variable symptom burden,
*21:20.040- 21:23.020* :  people are actually experiencing a very similar underlying disease process
*21:23.240- 21:25.400* :  so the presence of these protein clumps that
*21:25.940- 21:29.420* :  get in the way of normal functioning of nerves in the brain and the spinal cord.
*21:30.020- 21:33.680* :  So really what we desperately need for people affected by this disease are
*21:33.680- 21:37.160* :  biomarkers to be able to detect this disease process, these protein clumps,
*21:37.160- 21:38.980* :  and that's exactly what we've done in this work.
*21:39.540- 21:41.880* :  So we've adapted small RNA molecules.
*21:42.300- 21:45.940* :  They're typically used in cancer and Alzheimer's disease and diagnostics and
*21:45.940- 21:48.920* :  therapeutics, and we've adapted the first one really,
*21:48.920- 21:52.080* :  so that we have one of these RNA optimers for motor neuron disease,
*21:52.240- 21:55.300* :  and we've shown in our work that we can detect the disease,
*21:55.720- 22:00.520* :  even before symptom onset, using these biomarkers to detect disease in tissue
*22:00.520- 22:02.360* :  or in blood or spinal fluid.
*22:02.920- 22:06.480* :  And really the thing that makes me get up in the morning to do our research is that
*22:07.000- 22:10.180* :  we really need to be doing more for people affected by motor neuron disease,
*22:10.180- 22:13.060* :  and in my mind, the earlier we intervened,
*22:13.060- 22:15.820* :  the more likely we are to be successful with therapies.
*22:16.780- 22:18.860* :  And that's exactly what we're doing with this tool,
*22:18.860- 22:21.680* :  is to be able to detect the earlier stages of the disease before people
*22:22.040- 22:25.020* :  and develop substantial disabilities, substantial symptom burden,
*22:25.020- 22:27.160* :  to give us the best chance of doing exactly that.
*22:27.620- 22:31.200* :  For these biomarkers, they'll also give us the opportunity to see if therapies
*22:31.200- 22:32.360* :  are working in people.
*22:33.140- 22:36.320* :  Dr. Jenna Gregory, now to rule France,
*22:36.320- 22:39.880* :  in a town that's just a stone's throw away from the Swiss border.
*22:40.120- 22:42.980* :  It was a location of choice for the far right national rallies
*22:42.980- 22:47.300* :  second stop on the campaign trail for the European parliamentary elections
*22:47.380- 22:48.640* :  due to be held in June.
*22:48.800- 22:52.880* :  The party is keen to build on its growing success in recent years,
*22:53.360- 22:54.660* :  especially with young voters.
*22:55.300- 22:59.660* :  Mark Urban has been to the industrial town of Montbeliard to speak to people there
*23:00.120- 23:02.620* :  about why the far right speaks to them.
*23:03.780- 23:09.200* :  Montbeliard in the Jura, one of those places on the mountainous fringes of France,
*23:09.800- 23:12.360* :  a borderland close to Germany and Switzerland.
*23:12.360- 23:17.100* :  What you've got to hear is typical of what they call a France profound, deep France.
*23:17.180- 23:22.500* :  These rural areas where job losses, economic dislocation,
*23:22.500- 23:26.500* :  unhappiness with the way things are have created opportunities
*23:27.180- 23:31.320* :  on the far left, it's true, but mainly for the far right.
*23:31.320- 23:34.320* :  The question is whether in these elections,
*23:34.440- 23:40.100* :  they'll make really substantial gains and change the political game in France.
*23:41.360- 23:45.200* :  Christian Courouge worked at the Peugeot Carplant for decades.
*23:46.000- 23:47.500* :  Now it's largely closed.
*23:47.580- 23:51.000* :  He's trying to organize resistance to the far right.
*23:53.800- 23:57.020* :  With the rise of the national front, I felt I had to talk about it
*23:57.180- 24:01.340* :  because it seems so disgusting, so nauseating.
*24:01.820- 24:03.400* :  It smells like sewage.
*24:04.780- 24:06.560* :  It's like a plague coming.
*24:06.980- 24:10.440* :  I do not want that, neither for me nor my grandchildren.
*24:12.240- 24:15.980* :  These days, the national front calls itself the National Rally
*24:16.680- 24:21.060* :  and Contan Merculo is among their local militant or activists
*24:21.700- 24:25.180* :  under the leadership of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella,
*24:25.540- 24:29.220* :  the party's new talent who's coming to Montbeard.
*24:29.600- 24:31.980* :  He's too complement each other.
*24:32.380- 24:34.320* :  Marine Le Pen is going to reach more people
*24:34.320- 24:36.900* :  that are grassroots national front splitters.
*24:36.960- 24:39.560* :  Jordan Bardella will speak to the youth, the school children,
*24:39.840- 24:43.440* :  the university students, those who are not usually interested in politics.
*24:43.440- 24:45.960* :  His communication skills are relatability,
*24:46.540- 24:48.860* :  make people more interested in the national rally.
*24:49.800- 24:52.320* :  Many here feel they've lost their sense of security,
*24:52.840- 24:55.280* :  both economic and from crime.
*24:55.760- 25:00.180* :  Flavie Jacot is a floating voter who wants to feel safe again.
*25:02.800- 25:03.920* :  I don't know who I'll vote for.
*25:04.640- 25:09.160* :  I haven't decided yet, but what's important in a small town like this?
*25:10.520- 25:10.540* :  Security.
*25:12.800- 25:13.880* :  I live in the centre of town.
*25:14.600- 25:16.320* :  I want to walk my dog an evening in peace.
*25:17.160- 25:19.740* :  I don't want any aggression to be whistled at.
*25:21.260- 25:25.660* :  At Montbeard's concert hall, the crowds gather, thousands of people.
*25:26.540- 25:29.420* :  For decades, many French thought of this
*25:29.840- 25:32.560* :  as a far-right party, a racist party.
*25:33.080- 25:35.560* :  So what they've done is to rebrand it,
*25:35.680- 25:37.920* :  changing the name six years ago,
*25:38.380- 25:43.700* :  and now increasingly trying new messages and new faces like Jordan Bardella.
*25:44.440- 25:46.980* :  And here, at least, it's drawing the crowds.
*25:48.020- 25:50.660* :  Across town, a counter-demonstration.
*25:50.900- 25:55.320* :  It's clear, though, that those objecting to Jordan Bardella's presence here
*25:55.800- 25:57.360* :  are considerably outnumbered.
*25:58.100- 26:01.560* :  Finally, the moment arrives, thousands greet the national rallies,
*26:01.760- 26:02.640* :  brightening hope.
*26:05.020- 26:08.120* :  The party president, just 28 years old,
*26:08.660- 26:12.360* :  and now spearheading campaigning for June's European elections.
*26:13.820- 26:16.700* :  France is not conformism to a single way of thinking.
*26:17.160- 26:19.940* :  France is not the prior prohibition of expression.
*26:20.320- 26:22.440* :  France is a country of freedom,
*26:22.700- 26:27.320* :  and we, at Rassamblamon National, intend to keep it that way forever.
*26:29.040- 26:30.380* :  The morning after the rally,
*26:30.780- 26:32.720* :  and the regular Saturday food market,
*26:33.120- 26:34.620* :  springs up outside the venue.
*26:35.260- 26:36.800* :  Of course, the far-right can get votes,
*26:37.700- 26:38.800* :  but as the recent Dutch elections
*26:39.460- 26:40.800* :  or past European ones show,
*26:41.660- 26:44.820* :  that doesn't mean anyone else is ready to do political business with them.
*26:45.960- 26:50.780* :  So the right gets ready to harvest votes here and across this country.
*26:51.720- 26:54.780* :  As to whether that can amount to more than a protest movement,
*26:54.780- 26:57.220* :  that will be up to Jordan Bardella,
*26:57.620- 27:00.100* :  and the others elected to the European Parliament.
*27:01.300- 27:04.440* :  Mark Urban, well, with just a few months to go before those elections,
*27:04.440- 27:07.580* :  the EU has been putting pressure on social media firms
*27:08.080- 27:10.160* :  to do more to counter misinformation.
*27:10.960- 27:14.880* :  2024 is also a very busy election year around the world.
*27:15.420- 27:18.980* :  The video's sharing platform TikTok has launched an online election centre,
*27:18.980- 27:22.200* :  which it says will help young voters make informed decisions.
*27:23.040- 27:30.000* :  TikTok has around 142 million monthly active users in the EU alone,
*27:30.520- 27:34.840* :  and it's increasingly used by young people as a source of political information.
*27:35.280- 27:36.560* :  Stephanie Prentice reports.
*27:37.580- 27:43.560* :  It's estimated more than two billion people in more than 50 countries will go to the polls this year,
*27:44.100- 27:47.180* :  and with government agencies asking social media sites
*27:47.180- 27:49.360* :  to do more to combat this information,
*27:49.360- 27:54.680* :  and clearly flag things like AI content, TikTok has its solution.
*27:55.460- 27:59.080* :  The first iteration will be an election hub for UK voters.
*27:59.700- 28:02.860* :  The online centre will be a place to get verified information,
*28:02.860- 28:07.640* :  debunk fake news, watch educational videos and get the basics,
*28:07.660- 28:10.720* :  how, where, and when someone can vote.
*28:11.400- 28:14.780* :  Users will get there through prompts on related posts or searches.
*28:15.640- 28:18.700* :  The company said it was planning to introduce similar centres
*28:19.060- 28:22.480* :  in other countries around the world tailored to each election.
*28:23.580- 28:28.220* :  Its main adversary is the rise in AI-generated content and the potentially
*28:28.220- 28:30.200* :  damaging impact it could have.
*28:30.840- 28:35.380* :  The European Union has been pressuring social media giants to commit to action
*28:35.380- 28:40.740* :  ahead of Europe-wide polls, with threats of hefty fines for improper content moderation.
*28:41.800- 28:47.460* :  Brussels especially fears the impact of Russian manipulation on elections taking place in the
*28:47.460- 28:53.880* :  block's 27 member states in June, and will conduct what it calls stress tests on content
*28:53.880- 28:56.220* :  on 22 platforms in April.
*28:57.520- 28:58.460* :  Stephanie Prentice
*28:59.060- 29:03.340* :  Now, this month marks 25 years since the Gruffalo hit bookshelves.
*29:03.520- 29:08.060* :  Julia Donaldson's story of a friendly beast, illustrated by Axel Sheffler,
*29:08.540- 29:10.980* :  has sold millions of copies around the world.
*29:10.980- 29:16.640* :  But on his silver Jubilee, the author has some choice words for the monster she created.
*29:17.340- 29:20.060* :  Gruffalo fan David Lewis picks up the story.
*29:26.160- 29:29.900* :  And terrible teeth in his terrible jaws.
*29:29.900- 29:33.320* :  And now the Gruffalo is a quarter of a century old.
*29:33.720- 29:39.620* :  Julia Donaldson's tale about the horned beast with somewhat lackluster dental standards
*29:39.620- 29:46.120* :  who befriends a mouse in a wooded forest is loved by children and tired parents across the globe.
*29:46.120- 29:51.680* :  The popular bedtime book's been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects
*29:51.980- 29:53.600* :  and made a mint for the author.
*29:53.600- 29:59.020* :  Together with its sequel, the Gruffalo's child, it sold more than 18 million copies.
*29:59.020- 30:02.560* :  But the monster's creator isn't all about celebrating.
*30:02.560- 30:06.040* :  Donaldson insists that he hogs too much attention.
*30:06.540- 30:10.000* :  Speaking with BBC Scotland, the 75-year-old author said,
*30:10.000- 30:14.240* :  What I like is when people single out one of my other books as their favourite
*30:14.620- 30:16.700* :  as I think the Gruffalo's a bit spoiled.
*30:17.360- 30:18.520* :  And she may have a point.
*30:18.520- 30:25.240* :  Donaldson has written 210 books, many with long-time collaborator, illustrator Axel Sheffler.
*30:25.680- 30:30.600* :  Some like Tabby McTatt and Stickman have also been made into live-action features.
*30:30.600- 30:35.980* :  She went on to say there was a possibility the Gruffalo would never see the light of day.
*30:35.980- 30:40.240* :  It sat on one publisher's desk for about a year, she insisted.
*30:40.780- 30:43.820* :  Originally, the Gruffalo was going to be about a tiger,
*30:44.160- 30:47.200* :  but Donaldson couldn't find a word to rhyme with it.
*30:47.500- 30:51.760* :  The Gruffalo was created as its name rhymes with oh help.
