*00:34.280- 00:37.840* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:39.560- 00:44.920* :  I'm Janet Gillil and at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 29th of March, these are our main stories.
*00:45.500- 00:50.660* :  The authorities in South Africa say rescue workers have so far retrieved 20 bodies
*00:50.660- 00:55.220* :  from the site of a bus crash in which 45 people died.
*00:56.020- 01:03.300* :  Syria has blamed Israel for airstrikes near the city of Aleppo, which are reported to have killed dozens of people.
*01:03.880- 01:09.820* :  The Chinese technology firm, Huawei, says its profits more than doubled last year, despite U.S. sanctions.
*01:11.800- 01:12.640* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:12.960- 01:16.440* :  This has been one of the most exciting developments in cancer treatment in the last few years.
*01:16.580- 01:19.940* :  Our ability to retrain our immune system to remove damage cells,
*01:19.940- 01:22.700* :  who were giving the drugs before any tumor was erased.
*01:23.340- 01:29.400* :  How immunotherapy drugs could be an alternative to surgery for those with a breast cancer gene.
*01:34.360- 01:41.280* :  Police in South Africa are investigating why a bus plunged off an elevated section of road into a ravine,
*01:41.280- 01:44.840* :  bursting into flames and killing 45 people.
*01:45.520- 01:48.840* :  An 8-year-old girl is thought to be the sole survivor.
*01:49.160- 01:51.140* :  She's in hospital with serious injuries.
*01:51.800- 01:56.220* :  The passengers who'd set off from Botswana were traveling to an Easter church service.
*01:56.820- 01:59.720* :  I got more details from our correspondent, Xingai Inyokha.
*01:59.940- 02:05.460* :  What the transport minister said is that this accident happened at 11am on Thursday.
*02:05.460- 02:07.180* :  So it was in broad daylight.
*02:07.240- 02:09.160* :  There was no oncoming traffic.
*02:09.700- 02:14.420* :  This bus crashed into a ravine about 50 meters below the bridge.
*02:14.480- 02:18.400* :  And so it's really been difficult to access the scene of the accident,
*02:18.400- 02:21.280* :  the crash site, to retrieve some of those bodies.
*02:21.680- 02:24.480* :  It's a relatively large operation with sniffer dogs.
*02:24.920- 02:31.620* :  And we understand that a crane might be brought in to try to lift this bus up to try to recover some more of those victims.
*02:32.680- 02:37.300* :  Yes, and it seems that nearly everyone on board died apart from this one little girl.
*02:38.440- 02:41.120* :  Yes, and it's quite an amazing story.
*02:41.120- 02:45.540* :  The reason why she survived, they say, is because she was flung out of the vehicle.
*02:45.980- 02:48.720* :  There was another woman that was flung out of the vehicle,
*02:48.720- 02:53.120* :  but she also died on her way to hospital.
*02:53.120- 02:57.280* :  But they didn't really stand a chance if you look at those pictures
*02:57.880- 03:02.520* :  where the ravine was just such a long drop.
*03:02.920- 03:06.000* :  And even if you look at some of those pictures from the crash site,
*03:06.700- 03:09.140* :  that's, you know, this debris strewn everywhere.
*03:09.180- 03:12.920* :  And they were also gas canisters because they were attending a church service.
*03:12.920- 03:16.460* :  And so it would have been outdoors and would have to cook for themselves.
*03:16.460- 03:21.900* :  And so that also likely contributed to the inferno in which so many people died.
*03:23.160- 03:27.660* :  Ching Hai and Yucca, well, the road was one not recommended for use by large vehicles
*03:27.660- 03:30.260* :  because it has so many hairpin bends.
*03:31.000- 03:35.120* :  Colin MCB is a national spokesperson for South Africa's Department of Transport.
*03:35.660- 03:38.700* :  And James Coppnell asked him if there are questions to be answered
*03:38.700- 03:41.160* :  about the condition of this particular road.
*03:41.660- 03:45.360* :  I honestly think the road isn't bad, even though, of course,
*03:45.480- 03:49.680* :  the biggest issue we have in the country is the road user behavior.
*03:50.620- 03:54.280* :  So far, we cannot speculate in terms of what caused the accident.
*03:54.320- 03:56.880* :  What we do know is that he lost control of the bus.
*03:58.060- 04:02.300* :  But what the problems we have here is about the driver behavior,
*04:02.660- 04:06.360* :  which we continue to emphasize that no matter what we do,
*04:06.360- 04:10.200* :  we've got about 23,000 traffic officers in the country.
*04:10.940- 04:14.280* :  The vital population, we're talking about 16 million vehicles.
*04:15.260- 04:19.520* :  So you can imagine, we can't police each and every vehicle that is on the road.
*04:20.320- 04:26.260* :  So it comes down to the road user behavior in terms of how do they take care of themselves
*04:26.260- 04:31.360* :  when they are on the road. So we do not want to say it is the condition of the road that may
*04:31.360- 04:36.580* :  have led to what has happened, in fact, but I think it may be the issue of the road user
*04:36.600- 04:38.680* :  behavior or the driver behavior in this case.
*04:39.580- 04:42.500* :  I mean, I understand the point about the responsibility of the driver,
*04:42.500- 04:48.260* :  but perhaps had there been a stronger barrier given that this was on the edge of a ravine,
*04:48.260- 04:51.320* :  it's possible that it simply wouldn't have gone off the edge, no?
*04:52.060- 04:55.380* :  Especially our national roads, I'm very much good condition.
*04:55.380- 05:02.680* :  Provincial roads, well, somehow you could start question some of these barriers and I can't
*05:02.680- 05:08.540* :  speculate in terms of the condition of this, but such things have also happened on
*05:09.520- 05:18.340* :  road roads. So honestly, as I say, we can not always blame it on the barrier as such.
*05:18.900- 05:23.480* :  So when we say we lost control of the bus, what does it really mean?
*05:23.820- 05:27.440* :  Colin MCB, National spokesperson for South Africa's Department of Transport.
*05:28.220- 05:32.860* :  Reports from Syria say more than 40 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes.
*05:33.200- 05:37.420* :  Syria's Defence Ministry says Israeli planes targeted several sites near the North
*05:37.420- 05:41.900* :  Western City of Aleppo. Most of the dead are believed to be Syrian troops.
*05:42.560- 05:46.800* :  And a number are fighters from the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.
*05:47.420- 05:51.100* :  Our Middle East correspondent, Yolanda Nell, is following developments from Jerusalem.
*05:51.100- 05:54.200* :  She told us what was known about the attack near Aleppo.
*05:54.660- 05:58.540* :  The Syrian authorities are very clear blaming Israel for this attack, but I did ask the Israeli
*05:58.540- 06:02.960* :  military this morning and they were very clear that they don't comment on reports in foreign
*06:02.960- 06:07.920* :  media. This is kind of a stock response we get from them, particularly when it comes to cases in
*06:07.920- 06:12.660* :  Syria. So it kind of limits what you can say from here, but I mean, now looking around
*06:12.660- 06:17.460* :  all the reports emerging, these are areas in the countryside around Aleppo that were hit.
*06:17.940- 06:22.420* :  The UK-based Observatory for Human Rights, which has very strong sources on the ground,
*06:22.960- 06:26.520* :  says that these were close to rocket depots that areas hit,
*06:26.520- 06:31.280* :  belonging to the Lebanese group Hezbollah. Most of those killed Syrian soldiers,
*06:31.280- 06:37.580* :  according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, but also several people from Hezbollah.
*06:37.640- 06:43.020* :  And we've also got voters quoting security sources saying something along similar lines.
*06:43.020- 06:48.300* :  The Syrian state news agency had come out saying it was civilians and military personnel who
*06:48.300- 06:54.080* :  were killed. What does this tell us about the situation for the wider region, because we're
*06:54.080- 07:00.660* :  also seeing an increase of attacks in the cross-border region between Israel and Lebanon.
*07:01.440- 07:06.940* :  That's right. And these two things look likely to be related. We already know that when it comes
*07:06.940- 07:12.260* :  to attacks that Israel is carried out inside Syria, and it has previously talked about having
*07:12.260- 07:18.580* :  carried out hundreds of strikes inside Syria since the 2011 civil war started, it's very often
*07:18.580- 07:24.300* :  been trying to prevent weapons being transferred to Hezbollah, this powerful Lebanese armed group,
*07:24.300- 07:29.100* :  which is backed by Iran. And we know it's also targeted the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps
*07:29.500- 07:35.600* :  in Syria as part of this kind of proxy war that often goes on between Israel as a shadow war.
*07:35.600- 07:41.380* :  We often hear about it between Israel and Iran, which involve its proxies around the region.
*07:42.300- 07:46.440* :  Your land, Nell. And since we spoke to your land, the Israeli military has said it has killed
*07:46.440- 07:52.000* :  the deputy commander of Hezbollah's Rocket and Missile section in an airstrike in southern Lebanon.
*07:52.600- 07:58.520* :  It said Ali Abu-Uksan Naim had been responsible for conducting and planning attacks against Israeli
*07:58.520- 08:05.740* :  civilians. Video released online by Israel showed a moving vehicle exploding after being struck by a
*08:05.740- 08:11.960* :  missile. If you discover that you're carrying the gene mutation, which causes breast cancer,
*08:11.960- 08:16.740* :  then you're faced with a difficult choice. You can decide to have a mastectomy as Angelina
*08:16.740- 08:22.420* :  Jolie did or run the risk of developing the disease. Now a new study by the University of Cambridge
*08:22.420- 08:28.580* :  here in the UK has found that immunotherapy cancer drugs could provide an alternative to surgery.
*08:29.380- 08:34.160* :  Professor Valid Khalid, a senior author of the study, has been explaining the findings to Martha
*08:34.160- 08:40.080* :  Karney. We all know that prevention is better than cure and risk-good developing breast cancer
*08:40.760- 08:46.320* :  is affected by things such as age, breastfeeding and germline mutations, such as the BRCA1,
*08:46.320- 08:51.300* :  BRCA2 carriers that you've highlighted. But up to this moment, really, we haven't had a detailed
*08:51.300- 08:57.880* :  map of how these factors change the normal healthy breast. So we fixed this problem and over the last
*08:57.880- 09:04.740* :  five years, we built this detailed map of how these factors changed the cellular ecosystem within
*09:04.740- 09:10.360* :  the breast. And one of the big surprises from our study, which as I should say, this is the
*09:10.360- 09:16.900* :  world-largest map of this cellular changes. In the BRCA1, BRCA2, a healthy tissue, we find
*09:16.900- 09:23.000* :  exhausted immune cells. And this is surprising because normally these cells are found at late-stage
*09:23.000- 09:30.780* :  tumors. So what are exhausted immune cells? They are basically our immune system is there to
*09:30.780- 09:36.180* :  protect us against infection and disease to remove damaged cells. What tends to happen is
*09:36.460- 09:41.480* :  effectively the cells can become dysfunctional and they can't remove these cells, so they kind of
*09:41.480- 09:47.380* :  got termed exhausted. And that's where immunotherapy comes in it, doesn't it? Because it sort of
*09:47.820- 09:54.020* :  stimulates these exhausted cells in order to kill and destroy the cancerous ones. Exactly. And
*09:54.020- 09:57.320* :  this has been one of the most exciting developments in cancer treatment in the last few years,
*09:57.840- 10:03.780* :  is our ability to kind of reactivate or retrain our immune system to remove damaged cells.
*10:04.320- 10:09.000* :  So actually, what's happening now is with this detailed understanding of the biology of how
*10:09.000- 10:14.920* :  tumors develop and initiate. We've now initiated a new study with support from CROK, cancer
*10:14.920- 10:20.680* :  research UK. To be testing multiple compounds actually in a pre-clinical model, including immunotherapy,
*10:21.240- 10:26.360* :  to see if we could prevent a tumor onset. So it's basically be giving the drugs before any tumors
*10:26.360- 10:33.580* :  arise. Professor Valid Khalid, one year ago today, Evan Gushkiewicz of the Wall Street Journal
*10:33.580- 10:39.500* :  was arrested in Russia and accused of being a spy. His detention sent shock waves through the
*10:39.500- 10:44.680* :  foreign correspondent community. Nothing, of course, compared to the shock felt by Mr. Gushkiewicz's
*10:44.680- 10:50.500* :  family back home in America. Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow on an American
*10:50.500- 10:59.440* :  journalist in a Russian jail. I'm standing opposite a large force story building with pale yellow
*10:59.440- 11:06.520* :  walls and barbed wire. This is Lafort of a jail. It was built in Zaraist, Russia, and some of Russia's
*11:06.520- 11:12.340* :  most high profile prisoners have been incarcerated here, including political prisoners and dissidents.
*11:13.120- 11:19.860* :  Former inmates say that the most unnerving thing about this place is the sense of total isolation.
*11:20.680- 11:24.520* :  Locked up here is an American journalist, Evan Gushkiewicz.
*11:28.280- 11:33.940* :  One year ago, we caught a fleeting glimpse of the Wall Street Journal reporter as he was driven
*11:33.940- 11:41.920* :  away to Lafortoa. Evan Gushkiewicz had been arrested and accused of spying. The first US journalist
*11:41.920- 11:50.140* :  in Russia, since the Cold War, to be charged with espionage. The insinuations that he was somehow
*11:50.140- 11:57.720* :  engaging in some kind of criminal activity is just flat out false. Lin Tracey is the US ambassador
*11:57.720- 12:03.960* :  to Russia and one of the few people who've been allowed inside Lafortoa jail to see Evan.
*12:04.420- 12:11.540* :  He is managing, he's in good health, he's dealing extremely well with the day-to-day circumstances.
*12:11.540- 12:18.480* :  It's not easy when there are so many uncertainties. He was and is a journalist who was doing his
*12:18.480- 12:24.820* :  job. The message is release him, release him now. Yeah, it's been a really difficult year and
*12:24.820- 12:30.900* :  the uncertainties very hard to deal with. Danielle Gushkiewicz is Evan's older sister.
*12:31.540- 12:36.160* :  Speaking from Washington, she tells me about the letters Evan's been writing from prison,
*12:36.160- 12:42.460* :  and the ones she writes back. We have a lot of sibling banter back and forth, a lot of teasing
*12:42.520- 12:49.780* :  with love. I recently was asking him if it's okay for me to see the dune movie, the sequel in theaters,
*12:50.260- 12:56.620* :  felt guilty about seeing it since he can't, and he tells me about books he reads. Is it true that
*12:56.620- 13:04.260* :  he sent some flowers from prison? Yes, we want him to focus on himself, and here he is taking care of us,
*13:04.360- 13:11.480* :  but it was so nice for international women's day. He arranged for the women in his life to
*13:11.480- 13:17.500* :  receive some bouquets. He supports the people in his life. We desperately miss him.
*13:22.820- 13:27.960* :  Last month, Vladimir Putin claimed he'd love to see Evan Gushkiewicz go home,
*13:27.960- 13:35.480* :  but the Kremlin wants something, or rather someone in return. That someone is thought to be
*13:35.480- 13:41.720* :  an FSB officer, Vadim Krasnikov, who's serving a life sentence for murder in Germany.
*13:42.320- 13:47.480* :  The Wall Street Journal's editor-in-chief Emma Tucker believes that as far as Evan is concerned,
*13:47.480- 13:53.580* :  the Russians took him to trade him. Russia has latched on to the fact that there's a currency
*13:53.580- 14:00.720* :  it can use, and it's to be frank stockpiling Americans in its jails in order to be able to trade
*14:00.720- 14:06.680* :  them until later date. Evan is a hostage. He is a bargaining chip, Putin is holding him as currency,
*14:07.700- 14:12.180* :  and that is just the brutal reality of it, and it makes it very, very difficult for governments
*14:12.200- 14:16.980* :  to know exactly how to approach this, because there's a lot at stake here, including what might
*14:16.980- 14:23.600* :  happen in the future. Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Emma Tucker ending that report by Steve Rosenberg.
*14:25.800- 14:31.100* :  Still to come in this podcast, Oppenheimer finally premieres in Japan the only nation to have
*14:31.100- 14:37.320* :  suffered nuclear bombing to mixed reactions. When they were testing the bombs and then the people
*14:37.320- 14:42.100* :  there was like cheering for joy that you know it succeeded it and that disgusted me.
*14:48.360- 14:53.480* :  The global story helps make sense of the headlines with expert analysis from BBC journalists
*14:53.480- 14:59.300* :  around the world. Social media has essentially siloed a lot of young men and women into different
*14:59.300- 15:04.500* :  algorithmic bubbles. Men and women inhabiting the same environment in the real world,
*15:04.500- 15:10.900* :  but very different ones online. One global story at a time, in detail every Monday to Friday
*15:10.900- 15:16.980* :  from the BBC World Service. For those Russians who sympathize with Alex Ninovani it will cast a
*15:16.980- 15:23.820* :  very dark shadow. This looks like a message. Search for the global story wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*15:27.020- 15:32.500* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. More than a hundred villages in Western Sudan have been
*15:32.500- 15:37.540* :  set on fire since the Civil War there began last year, according to analysis of satellite and
*15:37.540- 15:43.200* :  social media. Researchers at the Centre for Information Residience said fire was being used as a
*15:43.200- 15:49.980* :  weapon of war. Thousands of people have died across Sudan and around 10 million have been displaced
*15:49.980- 15:55.820* :  in the power struggle between the army and a rival paramilitary force, the rapid support forces.
*15:56.520- 16:02.000* :  Our diplomatic correspondent James Landel told Michelle Hussain how images were used to piece
*16:02.000- 16:06.960* :  together what was happening on the ground. What they do with the Centre for Information Resilience
*16:06.960- 16:13.660* :  is they use NASA technology to detect heat sources fire. They then match that with satellite
*16:13.660- 16:19.480* :  technology that images that can show you know areas that have been burned and then they match that
*16:19.480- 16:25.160* :  with social media. Basically a lot of the armed groups that are taking part in this violence
*16:25.640- 16:31.620* :  share images with themselves and then that breaks out onto social media and you can use the data
*16:31.620- 16:35.820* :  within that to work out where that image was taken and when and if you match all that together
*16:35.820- 16:39.660* :  you can build up a picture of what's happening and the reason you have to do this is because you know
*16:39.660- 16:45.960* :  it's very very difficult to get access to this part of Sudan and essentially what they found that
*16:45.960- 16:53.200* :  is over the last year very conservatively they've managed to establish that 108 villages and
*16:53.200- 17:00.660* :  settlements have been burned and either fully or partially destroyed as a result of fire during
*17:00.660- 17:05.380* :  this conflict. Do we know who's? Yeah it's a pretty stark fact because it's displaced thousands of
*17:05.380- 17:10.880* :  people. Absolutely and do we know who's responsible because broadly in this civil war it's the Sudanese
*17:10.880- 17:17.240* :  forces on on one side and paramilitaries on the other. This group does not specifically attribute
*17:17.980- 17:22.720* :  responsibility because in each case the data around who is responsible for each individual case
*17:23.020- 17:28.140* :  is incredibly hard to establish. What they say though is that in a lot of these fires there are
*17:28.140- 17:34.280* :  images or fighters from one side in the conflict the rapid support forces are seen very close to
*17:34.280- 17:41.460* :  these fires you also see other allied Arab militia who are also involved or close to it they've
*17:41.460- 17:48.220* :  seen in these images so clearly they are responsible for you know a part of it. There's also some
*17:48.220- 17:53.320* :  evidence that some of the fires were caused as a result of airstrikes by the Sudanese armed forces
*17:53.320- 17:57.760* :  the other side of the conflict and then there's also some evidence that some of the fires are caused
*17:57.940- 18:06.560* :  into communal fighting that is very very localized groups that are using the conflict as cover
*18:06.560- 18:10.960* :  to settle long-standing schools but I think I think it would be fair to say that the bulk of
*18:11.260- 18:16.480* :  responsibility is almost always pointed at the rapid support forces whenever this is put to them
*18:17.820- 18:21.840* :  very hard to get communications with when it is put to them they tend to you know deny that
*18:22.900- 18:27.900* :  James Landell the Chinese tech giant Huawei has been at the center of an intense
*18:27.900- 18:33.060* :  standoff between the United States and China when the US and other countries placed restrictions
*18:33.060- 18:37.540* :  on the firm over fears that it's linked to the Chinese government posed a security risk
*18:37.840- 18:43.700* :  Huawei's revenues plummeted but the company has turned its fortunes around shortly before we
*18:43.700- 18:49.920* :  recorded this podcast it announced $12 billion of profits double that of last year
*18:50.120- 18:55.220* :  Mickey Bristol is our Asia Pacific editor it's an amazing turnaround really just to remind
*18:55.220- 19:02.100* :  listeners before 2019 before the US sanctions Huawei was a massive company producing consumer
*19:02.760- 19:07.980* :  electronic devices like laptops but also importantly network equipment infrastructure
*19:07.980- 19:12.880* :  equipment to make all those mobile phones work it was involved in dozens of countries across
*19:12.880- 19:18.980* :  the world including in the West now what happened around 2019 was that a lot of Western nations
*19:18.980- 19:25.840* :  decided to strip out this Huawei infrastructure from their networks failing that perhaps because
*19:25.840- 19:30.780* :  the company's links to the Chinese government there could be some kind of security risk also
*19:30.780- 19:37.980* :  the United States has banned Huawei from buying any or using any US technology including microchips
*19:37.980- 19:43.400* :  and it was thought that that would really cripple the company in fact many commentators suggested
*19:43.780- 19:50.240* :  the end of Huawei it hasn't been it's come back amazingly well and as you've given the figure
*19:50.240- 19:57.860* :  there $12 billion profit a $100 billion worth of turnover so really has bounced back rebounded
*19:57.860- 20:03.840* :  after those sanctions were imposed because other Chinese companies have gone bust how was
*20:03.840- 20:10.400* :  Huawei able to avoid the same fate a couple of things really one it's diversified into cloud
*20:10.400- 20:16.040* :  computing it's moved into the electric vehicle market using its software know how to combine with
*20:16.380- 20:21.740* :  car manufacturers so that's a couple of things it's done it's also last year launched a smartphone
*20:21.740- 20:29.060* :  which has really taken off in China and that's boosted its finances as well it's also received a lot
*20:29.060- 20:34.920* :  of subsidies from the Chinese government which wants to develop its own microchip industry inside
*20:34.920- 20:40.700* :  of China so it's got those subsidies there's also a suggestion and allegations from American
*20:40.700- 20:48.440* :  organizations that perhaps as well Huawei is trying to circumvent some of these US restrictions by
*20:48.880- 20:53.560* :  buying up smaller companies and getting those to buy chip technology and equipment from the
*20:53.560- 21:00.160* :  United States in order to benefit Huawei so the US might be coming up with new sanctions against
*21:00.160- 21:05.640* :  Huawei in the future so a combination of measures really which has seen it turn its fortunes
*21:05.640- 21:11.900* :  around. Mickey Riste, Oppenheimer the film about the creator of the nuclear bomb has been
*21:11.900- 21:18.340* :  showered with awards including Seven Oscars but it was always going to be a difficult watch in Japan
*21:18.340- 21:24.100* :  the only nation to have suffered nuclear bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War
*21:24.800- 21:30.640* :  during the films simultaneous release with another hit Barbie many in Japan were offended by the
*21:30.640- 21:36.220* :  barbenheimer meme which went viral they saw it as trivializing the horrors of the US military's
*21:36.220- 21:42.540* :  nuclear attacks which killed hundreds of thousands of people most of them civilians our Japan
*21:42.540- 21:47.760* :  correspondent Shima Khalil spoke to people in Hiroshima including some survivors of the bombing
*21:56.700- 22:01.280* :  the first atomic bomb exploded almost directly above the building in front of me the Hiroshima
*22:01.280- 22:06.640* :  piece memorial also known as the A bomb dome was the only structure left standing here the explosion
*22:06.640- 22:11.920* :  of the bomb became a ball of fire 1800 feet across it's been preserved in the same state as
*22:11.920- 22:18.000* :  immediately after the bombing on the 6th of august 1945 a carcass of a building laid bare with
*22:18.000- 22:23.560* :  its walls charred and a skeletal dome overlooking the motoyafso river where thousands of people
*22:23.560- 22:29.620* :  whose skin was burning of the time jumped in this was once a sight of carnage now i see visitors
*22:29.620- 22:35.040* :  walking across the memorial park some reading plaques taking pictures others listening to tour guides
*22:35.040- 22:40.020* :  with the famous Hiroshima tram in the background nearly 80 years on the legacy of J. Robert
*22:40.020- 22:46.540* :  openheimer the father of the atomic bomb is ever present here in Hiroshima all americans industrial
*22:46.540- 22:53.920* :  minor scientific innovation connected here secret laboratory now a film based on the life work
*22:53.920- 22:59.560* :  and moral dilemma of the enigmatic scientist is finally being shown in japan nearly a year after
*22:59.560- 23:04.760* :  its initial release why how about because this is the most important thing that ever happened in
*23:04.760- 23:10.660* :  the history of the world openheimer maybe the year is most celebrated film but for the people here
*23:10.660- 23:18.700* :  in Hiroshima the story cuts much deeper tomoyaki mimaki was three years old when Hiroshima was hit
*23:18.740- 23:24.300* :  he was playing outside his house on the outskirts of the city and remembers seeing a bright light
*23:24.300- 23:29.700* :  then ash falling from the sky he tells me about the burnt bodies in the city center
*23:29.700- 23:35.460* :  where his mother rushed with him and his brother to search for his father but none of these horrors
*23:35.460- 23:43.600* :  were portrayed in the film he told me after watching openheimer i thought that the devastation
*23:43.600- 23:48.540* :  of Hiroshima would appear somewhere in the storyline of the film but it didn't there were only
*23:48.540- 23:54.820* :  scenes in the united states i wanted them to show and tell what happened in Hiroshima i wish they
*23:54.820- 23:59.620* :  had shown the burned ruins of Hiroshima the museum here has displays of other children's heads
*23:59.620- 24:05.880* :  were burned how their clothes were burned i wanted people in the u.s. in particular to be able to see this
*24:07.380- 24:13.040* :  we're in the theater and the film just finished let's see what people make of it i was let's say shocked
*24:13.960- 24:22.240* :  and i when i watch it just in front of me there is once a lever of atomic bomb i was almost like
*24:22.240- 24:29.160* :  offended in some scenes like they're talking about Hiroshima again and again but in a meeting room
*24:29.680- 24:38.760* :  not thinking about people and at the same time i felt how it's difficult to imagine what really
*24:38.760- 24:47.340* :  happens on the ground when they plan it the scene that like it made a big impression on me was when
*24:47.340- 24:52.760* :  they were testing the bombs and and then the the people there was like cheering for joy that you
*24:52.760- 24:59.780* :  know it succeeded it and that disgusted me i felt really sick in my guts and but then like it
*24:59.780- 25:06.940* :  made me really think about you know the reality of that time and that past of how for those people
*25:06.940- 25:14.260* :  there could not have the imagination of the impact or how the people that would affect when they
*25:14.260- 25:20.040* :  dropped that bomb in japan we've been taught that we're the victims of the bomb but there's a part
*25:20.040- 25:25.100* :  in the film that said this bomb is going to save people's lives this was very new to me and it
*25:25.100- 25:29.240* :  was an opportunity for me to learn a different point of view of the u.s. and the world mr.
*25:29.240- 25:33.560* :  mimaki and others who've lived through the aftermath of the bombing continue to speak out
*25:33.560- 25:40.660* :  against nuclear weapons and want others to do the same i hope that the people of japan
*25:40.660- 25:46.340* :  including other survivors of harashima and nagasaki will see this film and have a conversation about it
*25:46.680- 25:51.180* :  the one hundredth anniversary of the atomic bombing will soon come and when it does there will
*25:51.180- 25:58.940* :  not be a single survivor left to tell the story in the middle of the harashima memorial park
*25:58.940- 26:05.240* :  visitors line up to ring the peace bell on its surface a world map without boundaries the atomic
*26:05.240- 26:11.380* :  energy symbol is placed where a log hits the bell a message of caution and hope from a city that
*26:11.380- 26:22.620* :  knows firsthand the terrors of nuclear warfare that report by shima keleo mammals have long had
*26:22.620- 26:27.820* :  to adapt to rapidly changing environments in order to survive but now for the first time
*26:27.880- 26:32.900* :  footage has captured how some animals are dramatically changing their behavior because of
*26:32.900- 26:38.500* :  climate change naturalists spent five years observing mammals for a new BBC television series
*26:38.520- 26:47.280* :  presented by david attenborough there are more than six thousand species of mammals on earth
*26:50.040- 26:59.200* :  and as our world changes so must end our climate and science reporter Esmi salad told us what the
*26:59.200- 27:05.060* :  production team uncovered they've captured for the first time on camera some of the adaptations that
*27:05.060- 27:10.680* :  these mammals are showing to not only a warmer world but also a world rapidly being changed by
*27:10.680- 27:17.100* :  humans so for example forested have now been replaced by parmal plantations and how macaques that
*27:17.100- 27:22.620* :  live there are having to deal with this new habitat and maybe different food sources and give us
*27:22.620- 27:29.700* :  some examples of for instance it's been quite devastating for Arctic foxes who are now turning to
*27:29.700- 27:34.560* :  cannibalism yeah that was probably one of the most shocking parts of the series when that was the
*27:34.560- 27:40.920* :  one that really stuck with me so effectively Arctic foxes rely on the sea ice to get their food
*27:41.580- 27:46.780* :  so in this instance what had happened is the sea ice hadn't formed it was too warm and what
*27:46.780- 27:50.320* :  typically happens is polar bears will go out on the sea ice they'll catch their prey and the left
*27:50.360- 27:55.640* :  over the Arctic foxes feed on but without that sea ice the polar bears can't do that and that means
*27:55.640- 28:02.260* :  there's no food for the Arctic foxes so in one scene we see an Arctic fox die and sadly because
*28:02.300- 28:06.600* :  there's no other food around other Arctic foxes end up feeding on it and that's the first time
*28:06.980- 28:11.440* :  we think that behavior has been captured on camera and potentially speaks to the kind of
*28:11.440- 28:17.860* :  difficulties that these species are facing as temperatures begin to rise and we also see the otters
*28:18.120- 28:23.820* :  and lemurs also having to adapt their behavior yeah so there's not just you know the sort of sad scenes
*28:23.860- 28:29.100* :  and I guess the losers of this situation but what the series also shows is the amazing ability
*28:29.100- 28:34.920* :  of mammals to adapt very quickly to changing circumstances so those otters you mentioned have
*28:35.340- 28:40.580* :  managed to return to the streets of Singapore which is really brilliant and also we have
*28:40.840- 28:46.660* :  white safari lemurs now what they've done is they're living in warming environment like many
*28:46.660- 28:51.400* :  mammals but what they've learnt to do is they've learnt to hug these trees called salvadora trees
*28:51.400- 28:56.320* :  also called toothbrush trees which I love and what happens there is that those trees suck up
*28:56.320- 29:01.120* :  cool water from the ground so their trunks are very cool so we see all the lemurs hugging the tree
*29:01.120- 29:05.240* :  to stay cool so it shows they are very adaptable and it's a real celebration of these mammals
*29:06.660- 29:07.420* :  Esmi Selad
*29:10.180- 29:14.620* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later
