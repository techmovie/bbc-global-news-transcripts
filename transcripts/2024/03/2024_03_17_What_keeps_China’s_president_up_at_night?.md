*01:33.380- 01:38.540* :  from the BBC World Service. Every Sunday for the past few weeks, we've been publishing an
*01:38.540- 01:44.940* :  episode of the global story podcast here. The global story looks at one big story in detail

*01:53.660- 01:58.240* :  In this episode, we're asking what keeps China's president up at night?
*02:00.800- 02:06.500* :  Xi Jinping has held China's top job for more than a decade. He faces no term limits,
*02:06.620- 02:12.780* :  no real checks on his personal power. His ideas have already been enshrined in writing in the
*02:12.780- 02:20.560* :  constitution. He seems to live in a kind of personal political Shangri-la. But there are signs
*02:20.560- 02:25.820* :  that something is troubling him. His main deputies just been very publicly diminished.
*02:25.820- 02:32.640* :  Two others have vanished altogether and state security laws have been tightened yet again.
*02:33.320- 02:37.540* :  So what exactly might Xi Jinping be so worried about?
*02:40.680- 02:44.480* :  Well, joining me here in the studio is my colleague, Celia Hatton, who spent 15 years as a
*02:44.480- 02:49.140* :  correspondent in Beijing. She's now the BBC's East Asia Editor. Hello, Celia. Hello.
*02:49.180- 02:54.360* :  And also joining us on the line is Rana Mitter, who's presented many BBC documentaries about China.
*02:54.360- 02:59.620* :  He's a China expert and his day job is a professor of US-Asia Relations at the Harvard
*02:59.620- 03:03.960* :  Kennedy School. Hello, Rana. Hello, Adam. Have you ever thought about doing a podcast about
*03:04.200- 03:07.000* :  time management? Because it sounds like you're very good at it with all those jobs.
*03:08.040- 03:10.320* :  If I want some of that, Adam, I'll come for tips from you, I think.
*03:10.320- 03:12.700* :  Oh, thank you. You can stay for the whole episode.
*03:13.140- 03:18.620* :  Right. So, Celia, if we stick with this metaphor of Xi Jinping in bed,
*03:19.680- 03:23.400* :  maybe a sleep, maybe not a sleep. I mean, the idea of us knowing his sleep patterns
*03:23.400- 03:26.420* :  is so far from the reality of what we actually know about him, isn't it?
*03:26.500- 03:32.560* :  Oh, God, that's so true. I mean, even down to where he sleeps at night. We don't actually know.
*03:32.560- 03:38.460* :  Now, the myth is that he lives in a compound right next to China's forbidden city,
*03:38.460- 03:42.160* :  right in the heart of Beijing. It's very carefully guarded compound.
*03:42.160- 03:47.200* :  From what we think we know about it, it's got beautiful lakes and green rolling hills,
*03:47.200- 03:51.920* :  and that's where most government leaders are in theory, live, and work.
*03:52.340- 03:57.600* :  Now, in practice, we think he actually lives in Beijing's northeast corner,
*03:57.600- 04:03.420* :  kind of far out of Beijing in a place called Jade Spring Hill, where the top leaders are
*04:03.420- 04:08.040* :  actually believed to live. So, if we want to picture him at night, maybe like staring
*04:08.040- 04:13.060* :  blinkingly at the ceiling, probably he's out in the northeast corner of Beijing,
*04:13.060- 04:16.000* :  and not with the symbolic heart of the city.
*04:16.440- 04:21.440* :  Rana, I'm a former British political correspondent, so I'm used to trading in press conferences,
*04:21.440- 04:25.620* :  interviews, leaks, WhatsApp's from sources, lunches with ministers.
*04:25.620- 04:28.460* :  You China watchers, you get hardly any of that, too.
*04:29.060- 04:32.740* :  I think that's absolutely right, Adam. Perhaps 10 or 15 years ago, although China has always
*04:32.740- 04:37.320* :  been a pretty close society when it comes to political leaks, there was a political system
*04:37.320- 04:41.520* :  that had oppositional factions within it. Whoever was the president still had to do a little bit
*04:41.520- 04:47.000* :  to appease, whoever was in the opposite faction to him, and has always been a him so far.
*04:47.460- 04:52.260* :  But under Xi Jinping, under last, let's say, 10 or 11 years, it's been increasingly the case
*04:52.260- 04:56.140* :  that there's factions have disappeared. And as a result, the number of people who will maybe
*04:56.760- 05:01.040* :  put out a bit of interesting news, not, of course, in the domestic Chinese press, which is highly
*05:01.040- 05:05.720* :  censored, but maybe in the newspapers in Hong Kong, or maybe even more daringly, something that
*05:06.060- 05:10.740* :  in the overseas Chinese press, that kind of way of looking into what might be happening in
*05:11.000- 05:14.960* :  those places that Celia mentioned, you know, the housing compounds out in the far north east,
*05:14.960- 05:18.720* :  or even in the forbidden city, much, much harder to find these days.
*05:19.220- 05:24.160* :  And Celia, just to stick with Xi Jinping personally for a bit, what more do we know about
*05:24.160- 05:27.960* :  his personal life, his domestic life, his inner life?
*05:27.960- 05:32.700* :  No, very, very little. A few sort of tidbits that are dribbled out here and there. Of course,
*05:32.700- 05:38.760* :  we know he's married to a very glamorous woman who used to be an opera singer. He's got one
*05:38.760- 05:45.700* :  daughter who attended Harvard. She's now believed to be probably back in China. We believe we know
*05:45.700- 05:50.480* :  that he loves football. You know, it led to a whole craze in China. I did an entire documentary
*05:50.480- 05:55.940* :  traveling to the far reaches of China to go to football schools that had been established for
*05:56.180- 06:00.780* :  poor children in China, because it kind of kicked off this idea that if, well, a Xi Jinping likes it,
*06:01.020- 06:02.000* :  you know, we should all do it.
*06:04.920- 06:07.840* :  Zhonglian Quan, they shout, come on, come on, come on.
*06:09.280- 06:14.060* :  But in terms of what he is, what he likes to do, what his enthusiasm's are,
*06:14.560- 06:20.640* :  he seems to be a party man through and through. He rose up through the ranks of the party. He had
*06:20.640- 06:26.840* :  a very tumultuous childhood. He's the son of a communist revolutionary. He was actually the only
*06:26.840- 06:32.700* :  Chinese leader who was born after the revolution to come into power. And he had a reputation,
*06:32.700- 06:38.600* :  even in the early stages of his career, as being someone who was very focused on rising through
*06:38.600- 06:44.280* :  the ranks. He's not known for a lot of eccentric dinners or fast cars. You know, he didn't really
*06:44.420- 06:45.080* :  double in that.
*06:45.660- 06:49.460* :  Rana, just to check, you didn't teach his daughter at Harvard, did you? Because that would be an amazing
*06:49.460- 06:53.920* :  coup. I'm afraid she, from all accounts, was there some years before I actually turn up on the
*06:53.920- 06:59.700* :  scene. So I missed out on that. Right. Let's pursue this thesis then. There might be some things that
*06:59.700- 07:05.320* :  are keeping him awake. If we knew anything about his sleep patterns. Celia, we've got to look for
*07:05.340- 07:10.620* :  clues then. One of the first clues was at the end of the big people's congress meeting, which
*07:10.620- 07:16.440* :  is sometimes described as China's parliament, often with the word rubber stamping, not real attached
*07:16.440- 07:21.000* :  to it. And there was something a bit peculiar about this year's edition of that.
*07:21.780- 07:26.700* :  That's right. One thing that we've traditionally looked forward to for the past 30 years is that
*07:26.700- 07:31.380* :  there's a press conference. Once a year, China's premiere gives a press conference. And over the
*07:31.380- 07:35.620* :  years, it's become more and more staged when I was first a journalist in China in the early
*07:35.620- 07:42.180* :  2000s. Actually, you could go and in theory get picked and asked a question. That is all over now.
*07:42.180- 07:47.580* :  You're invited, perhaps, to ask a question. You have to submit your question in advance. It's all
*07:47.580- 07:52.820* :  very staged. But it was still a press conference nonetheless when the Ruzo kind of a wide range of
*07:52.820- 07:58.140* :  questions asked and answered, well, this year, it was announced right at the start of the parliamentary
*07:58.140- 08:03.160* :  season, which was shortened, I should add, that this year's press conference would not happen.
*08:03.560- 08:09.540* :  And it would not happen right up until 2027. So they've just completely just bifted out of the
*08:09.540- 08:14.080* :  park. And so we didn't hear from China's premiere. Now, there are two things about this. First,
*08:14.080- 08:19.940* :  it took away a kind of useful attempt to get some answers out of the Chinese government. And also,
*08:19.940- 08:25.320* :  it really took away a platform from China's premiere. And so again, we're just seeing that
*08:25.320- 08:30.360* :  Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the party, the president of China, the chairman of the Central
*08:30.360- 08:35.720* :  Military Commission, he really is at the top. And so it's kind of served two functions
*08:35.720- 08:42.160* :  by the cancellation of this press conference. And Rana, people of high rank and important job
*08:42.160- 08:45.860* :  in the administration disappearing has been a bit of a theme the last couple of years.
*08:46.240- 08:50.720* :  It really has. We were saying earlier that it's very difficult to tell what's going on behind
*08:50.720- 08:56.880* :  the very dark screen that hides the elite level of Chinese politics. Chinese politics at the top
*08:56.880- 09:02.220* :  level, we see things that we can observe and then try and extrapolate backwards from them. In the
*09:02.220- 09:07.420* :  last half year or so, we've seen that the foreign minister of China, Xinjiang, was dismissed
*09:07.420- 09:13.260* :  summarily from his post. The defense minister of China, Li Shangfeng, was also dismissed summarily
*09:13.260- 09:18.700* :  from his post. Several generals, including some involved in China's immensely important rocket
*09:18.700- 09:23.660* :  force, which amongst other things has to do with nuclear weapons, were also kicked out of their
*09:23.660- 09:28.640* :  jobs at very short notice. Now, we don't know exactly the reasons why even now, particularly
*09:28.640- 09:32.660* :  around Xinjiang, the former foreign minister, there were a lot of rumours swirling that, you know,
*09:32.660- 09:37.420* :  apparently it's due to his personal life he may have had. It seems a girlfriend, there may have
*09:37.420- 09:41.980* :  been a pregnancy involved, but nothing has ever been officially said about any of these things.
*09:42.440- 09:46.980* :  So we don't know the details of the wise and wherefores. But what we can say is, look,
*09:47.760- 09:52.040* :  these things clearly have happened. The dismissals were officially announced by the party,
*09:52.040- 09:58.360* :  they're on the Xinjiang news agency and other major news outlets from China. And therefore,
*09:58.360- 10:04.100* :  it's clear that there is something going on inside the top leadership. And the questions that
*10:04.100- 10:08.620* :  they'll have to be asked are, is it the case that Xi Jinping, as people tend to say, has really
*10:08.620- 10:15.260* :  managed to arrange all of the leadership chess pieces precisely to do his bidding? Or is there
*10:15.260- 10:19.560* :  some sense that even now there are disputes about policy that don't lead to a definite change
*10:19.560- 10:23.880* :  of direction, but suggest that different personnel can still be shoved out of the way
*10:23.880- 10:30.840* :  if they don't do what she wants? So, Celia, does that mean that Xi Jinping might be kept awake by
*10:30.840- 10:36.160* :  that thing that keeps all political leaders awake, which is potential rivals? Or is it actually
*10:36.160- 10:41.200* :  disagreements? Or is it actually individual things with each of those people like sex scandals
*10:41.200- 10:45.500* :  whatever? Or is it a combination of all those things? Or do we just not know? I'm so confused.
*10:47.080- 10:52.480* :  We don't know what led to either of these people being bifbed out of their posts. Now, in the case of
*10:52.480- 10:59.400* :  Xinjiang, the former foreign minister, he was thought to be a real protégé of Xi Jinping. Fascinating
*10:59.400- 11:06.020* : ly, he wasn't just simply replaced and China went on as normal. He has basically been raced from
*11:06.020- 11:10.860* :  party history. I was just on the Chinese foreign ministry website yesterday. If you look up the list
*11:10.860- 11:17.920* :  of past foreign ministers, his name isn't even there. Now, was he some potential rival? I don't
*11:17.920- 11:24.200* :  think so. I think he's done something. You know, these rumors about this affair and the girl friend,
*11:24.200- 11:30.620* :  I think, are so persistent. There's probably something there. But it seems with Xi Jinping that,
*11:31.080- 11:34.840* :  you know, when we look at, for example, with the defense minister, another defense minister
*11:34.840- 11:39.320* :  was put into place. We have a man named Dongjun. Now, during this past parliament, there were rumors
*11:39.320- 11:45.260* :  that maybe Dongjun would also get a second title, that of state counselor. And that would have
*11:45.260- 11:50.840* :  put him at the same level as his predecessor, Li Shangfu, who got kicked out. That didn't happen.
*11:50.840- 11:55.540* :  And so it seems that if you think about Xi Jinping sitting alone in his bedroom at night,
*11:55.540- 12:01.020* :  worrying about things, it seems that he's still trying to lessen the positions of other people
*12:01.020- 12:07.320* :  around him. I think it is a correct interpretation that Xi Jinping is the most powerful paramount leader
*12:07.320- 12:11.400* :  that China has had certainly since, you know, in some sense, it's Dongxiao-ping. But I think
*12:11.400- 12:15.880* :  actually we can see some signs that there are also ways in which other people are brought in
*12:15.880- 12:21.340* :  at the top leadership level to try and, you know, break into that idea of, you know, silent
*12:21.340- 12:26.300* :  contemplation on Xi's part about what he's going to do next. The number two, in a sense,
*12:26.300- 12:30.820* :  at least the one who people often say is a sort of gatekeeper or a figure who actually talks
*12:30.820- 12:34.800* :  directly to Xi about a lot of these things is not the prime minister, Li Shang necessarily,
*12:35.220- 12:40.320* :  but Tai Chi, another figure who's at that top level. And it's worth noting that that small group
*12:40.320- 12:44.380* :  at the top, top seven of whom Xi Jinping is number one, the Standing Committee of the
*12:44.380- 12:49.200* :  Politburo, are of course handpicked by Xi. They were brought into the leadership formally at the end
*12:49.200- 12:53.720* :  of 2022. But they also, they had their own trajectories and their own interests in a
*12:53.720- 12:58.640* :  summer interested in economics, others interested in technology, others very much interested in
*12:58.640- 13:03.420* :  crackdowns on security issues and highly authoritarian politics. And actually China's sort of
*13:03.420- 13:09.020* :  most important propagandist, Wang Huning, all these people are around Xi Jinping and all these
*13:09.020- 13:14.580* :  people, on suspects, input into his thoughts about where China should go next and what he should
*13:14.580- 13:18.540* :  do next. I'm sure in the end he marches to the beat of his own drum, but these are people who he
*13:18.540- 13:23.580* :  gets to talk to. Rana, I'm just picturing your bookcase. It's really impressive in my mind.
*13:23.860- 13:28.380* :  Right, so we've talked about the political environment that Xi Jinping is operating in.
*13:28.520- 13:31.800* :  Next, we're going to talk about something that keeps all leaders awake at night, whether they
*13:31.800- 13:33.300* :  admit it or not, the economy.

*15:27.580- 15:33.920* :  they are, how their country's economy is doing. Ranna, you wanted to point to Xi Jinping's
*15:34.160- 15:40.660* :  New Year's message as a revealing moment. Absolutely Adam, so in New Year, this is a western style
*15:40.660- 15:47.540* :  New Year early January. Xi Jinping made a television address. In which he gave, you know,
*15:47.540- 15:52.020* :  a sort of state of the union as you might say in the US, a pretty clear statement of all the things
*15:52.020- 15:55.800* :  that have been going fantastically for China, which is what those messages generally are about.
*15:55.800- 16:00.640* :  But it had one very unusual thing, which was, if not exactly an apology, at least an
*16:00.640- 16:17.260* :  knowledge that things weren't going so well. And so what he's saying there is, along the way,
*16:17.260- 16:24.380* :  we're bound to encounter headwinds. Some enterprises had a tough time. Some people had difficulty
*16:24.380- 16:30.700* :  finding jobs and meeting basic needs. And for the general secretary of the Communist Party,
*16:31.320- 16:36.960* :  to make that sort of concession on national TV was a sign that even he could not avoid the fact
*16:36.960- 16:43.060* :  that many of the ordinary citizens watching TV at New Year would have felt that life was not going
*16:43.060- 16:47.920* :  well in terms of the economy. I mean, we talked before about what keeps Xi Jinping awake at night.
*16:48.040- 16:51.440* :  I think, you know, he may be thinking about this as now, obviously, just reaching into a mind
*16:51.440- 16:56.880* :  which I don't know at all. Let's say a 32-year-old single mother who lives in a third tier city,
*16:56.880- 17:02.600* :  maybe Ningboi in the central China, you know, she's got a dodgy bank account that has her savings in
*17:02.600- 17:05.920* :  it, which don't earn as much interest as she'd like, and she's not sure that there might not be a
*17:05.920- 17:10.180* :  bank crash. She's what's called a funnel, a mortgage slave in China. In other words, she's putting
*17:10.180- 17:14.380* :  most of her disposable income into paying for a highly expensive property, but she really needs
*17:14.380- 17:17.800* :  to make sure she has someone to live. As I mentioned, she's a single mother. That's not that common
*17:17.800- 17:21.800* :  in China these days, but it's much commoner than it used to be. And she's got a single child who
*17:21.800- 17:26.560* :  needs to be educated, not free in China. You get free high school at the basic level, but you have
*17:26.560- 17:31.440* :  to pay maybe for extra tutoring because the competition for getting through the university exams,
*17:31.440- 17:36.200* :  the gaukau, as they're called, at the age of 18, are so fierce in China that it's very much an
*17:36.280- 17:39.860* :  up-or-out type of system, and she has to invest in that. And then there are her parents who are
*17:39.860- 17:44.320* :  basically getting older. China's one-char policy is led to a demographic shift that means that China
*17:44.680- 17:49.320* :  is getting older before it gets richer. All of these things are coming together to make her feel
*17:49.320- 17:52.780* :  that maybe she wants to, in the phrase that was very common a couple of years ago,
*17:53.240- 17:57.660* :  tumping life flat, you know, just life flat in the ground and try and work out how on earth
*17:57.960- 18:03.580* :  everything's going to work out. That's the person, I think, that Xi Jinping is going to have to be
*18:03.580- 18:08.640* :  thinking about in terms of working out, where is China's economy going? Where did that great growth
*18:08.640- 18:14.700* :  spurt go? And how on earth can we adapt to a changing new world in which China, you know, produces
*18:14.700- 18:20.320* :  added value jobs rather than manufacturing to get that kind of positive feeling back?
*18:20.700- 18:24.600* :  And Rana, that imaginary person you talked about could probably keep their heads above water
*18:24.600- 18:30.240* :  economically when China was growth rate was like double digits, less so when it's single digits,
*18:30.240- 18:34.500* :  even though it's a single digit, which is much bigger than most Western economies are experiencing.
*18:34.700- 18:38.080* :  That's absolutely right. I mean, they've talked about a growth rate for this year of about 5%
*18:38.080- 18:44.360* :  now. If the UK or even the US got a 5% growth rate, they'd be very pleased. The difference is that
*18:44.360- 18:50.960* :  the COVID pandemic really hit China's economy hard and recovery from that has been less smooth
*18:50.960- 18:56.060* :  than they would have wanted. And secondly, of course, in the liberal world, if you really don't like
*18:56.060- 18:59.840* :  the government, you can verge it out and choose something else. The Communist Party has placed
*18:59.840- 19:05.420* :  not all, but a great deal of its legitimacy on the idea that, look, we don't do liberal style
*19:05.420- 19:12.280* :  democracy, but we do increase standards of living year by year, decade by decade. Ask your
*19:12.280- 19:16.140* :  grandparents what they have during the Cultural Revolution and look at what you have now and be happy.
*19:16.560- 19:21.680* :  As long as that growth continued, if not always evenly, at least noticeably, that work quite well.
*19:22.180- 19:27.740* :  But for many people now, it's no longer evident that they or their children will have a better
*19:27.740- 19:32.760* :  standard of life than their parents would have done. And that is something that is proving much
*19:32.780- 19:36.480* :  more difficult to turn into a positive narrative in the China of now.
*19:42.960- 19:48.480* :  Celia, Rana there was talking about kind of norge towards the economic reality, but a lot of
*19:48.480- 19:53.500* :  your reporting this year has been about the Chinese authorities hushing up the economic reality.
*19:53.500- 19:59.760* :  That's right. I've spent a lot of time focusing on the missing numbers. So statistics that we used
*19:59.760- 20:04.480* :  to get information we used to get from the Chinese authorities that we simply don't get anymore.
*20:04.480- 20:10.480* :  And the biggest example, or the most obvious example, came last summer actually when China abruptly
*20:10.480- 20:16.700* :  announced that it wasn't going to release its youth unemployment figures anymore. Now, the month
*20:16.700- 20:23.420* :  before at last figure that it had released, it said that 21.3. So about one in five young people
*20:23.420- 20:29.900* :  were out of work. And that's a really shocking statistic. Now, as Rana said, many families in China
*20:29.900- 20:36.000* :  only have one child. And it's really important. All the resources are poured into that child to make
*20:36.000- 20:41.380* :  sure that child goes to a good university, gets a good job. So to think that one in five are out of
*20:41.380- 20:46.520* :  work. It was quite shocking and worrying for many, many families. So the government said we don't
*20:46.520- 20:51.180* :  think the statistic is very accurate anymore. We're not going to publish it. And so that led to
*20:51.180- 20:56.340* :  actually quite an outpouring on Chinese social media, which as you can imagine is quite tightly
*20:56.340- 21:02.520* :  censored. But many people's uncharacteristically wrote saying how upset they were that the government
*21:02.520- 21:07.500* :  wasn't releasing this figure. What were they covering up? That kind of thing. Now, in January,
*21:07.500- 21:11.420* :  we then had the government come out and say, oh, we've come up with a new way to calculate the
*21:11.420- 21:18.120* :  figure. Now, of course, it's much lower than before. So with that 14.7, but still quite high. And so
*21:18.120- 21:23.580* :  we're thinking about what keeps Xi Jinping up at night. There's another thing. They've re-tooled
*21:23.580- 21:28.640* :  how to calculate youth unemployment. But still, we have the government suggesting that actually maybe
*21:28.640- 21:34.980* :  university graduates should consider working in factories. Right, let's have a conversation now about
*21:34.980- 21:40.260* :  how Xi Jinping might be feeling about his relationship with other world leaders. One of them, of course,
*21:40.260- 21:45.340* :  is Joe Biden, U.S. President, who last week gave his State of the Union, where he mentioned China.
*21:46.160- 21:51.180* :  I've heard many of my Republican and Democratic trends say that China is on the rise.
*21:52.920- 22:01.340* :  And America's falling behind. They've got a backwards. America's rising. We have the best economy
*22:01.340- 22:06.520* :  in the world. And since I've come to office, our GTP is up. Our trade deficit of China is down
*22:06.520- 22:12.220* :  to the lowest point in over a decade. And we're standing up against China's unfair economic practices.
*22:13.840- 22:17.160* :  We're standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.
*22:18.360- 22:24.100* :  I've revitalized our partnership and alliance and the Pacific. I've made sure that the most
*22:24.100- 22:32.220* :  advanced American technologies can't be used in China. Frankly, for all this tough talk on China,
*22:32.220- 22:38.980* :  it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that. I want competition with China not conflict.
*22:40.380- 22:45.340* :  We're in a stronger position to win the conflict of the 21st century against China than anyone else
*22:45.340- 22:51.780* :  for that matter than any time as well. Rana, parking the fact that Joe Biden seemed to invent a new
*22:51.780- 22:56.760* :  measure of economic growth there called GTP, rather than GDP. What would Xi Jinping have thought
*22:56.760- 23:01.080* :  if he'd been watching or listening to the State of the Union? I think he will be basically looking
*23:01.080- 23:07.360* :  at Joe Biden, hearing the words translated for him, and wondering how much of this really relates
*23:07.360- 23:13.380* :  to what he perceives as the way in which the United States has radically changed its policy
*23:13.800- 23:19.520* :  in terms of dealing with China on issues of both economics and security. So up to probably the
*23:19.540- 23:24.220* :  turn of the century, let's say the early 2000s, I think it's fair to say that there were lots of
*23:24.220- 23:30.900* :  areas where the United States and China actually had quite similar goals if for different purposes.
*23:30.980- 23:36.240* :  And that's the best example was the US really kind of working hard to get China into the World
*23:36.240- 23:40.820* :  Trade Organization, which they did in 2001. So you can see that sort of joint effort, which was
*23:40.820- 23:45.940* :  typical of a time that's now pretty much vanished into thin air. Today, apart from to some extent on
*23:45.940- 23:50.760* :  climate change, and even that's quite partial, it's very hard to see any areas where actually the
*23:50.760- 23:57.440* :  two sides really have a mutual and shared interest in that way. And therefore, what I think Xi Jinping
*23:57.440- 24:02.740* :  will hear is, okay, you're talking about competition, but what you really mean is to use an old
*24:02.740- 24:07.640* :  Cold War phrase containment. But at the same time, from Xi Jinping's point of view, since he is
*24:07.640- 24:12.900* :  clearly going to be the greatest booster of the idea that China is rising in the world, he will
*24:12.900- 24:18.060* :  hear Joe Biden's words and basically say, that's not the way that it looks from outside of the fence.
*24:22.220- 24:26.500* :  Celia, as we come to the end of this episode of the global story, any other things that might be
*24:26.500- 24:32.340* :  keeping Xi Jinping awake at night? It's been alleged that Xi Jinping is out of ideas. So when he
*24:32.340- 24:38.920* :  first came into power in 2012, he was full of these kind of majestic speeches where he talked about
*24:38.920- 24:44.920* :  the Chinese dream, the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, all these kind of really sweeping
*24:44.920- 24:51.020* :  statements. The big thing that really has been pushed in the past few months is this idea of new
*24:51.020- 24:57.580* :  productive forces. So this retooling of the Chinese economy to go away from traditional things that
*24:57.580- 25:03.280* :  have driven the economy to kind of more fancy high-end, whiz-bank things, renewable energy, artificial
*25:03.320- 25:07.740* :  intelligence, that kind of thing. But those aren't the things that are going to create lots of jobs.
*25:07.740- 25:13.220* :  That's not really going to help our 32-year-old single mother really make sure that there's food on
*25:13.220- 25:18.880* :  the table. And so I think the thing that might really worry Xi Jinping is, where's my next big idea?
*25:18.880- 25:25.040* :  How do I kind of get the Chinese people excited again and get that economic growth up again?
*25:25.300- 25:30.980* :  So tiredness from being in office so long, not from insomnia induced by lots of domestic and
*25:30.980- 25:35.840* :  international problems? Well, I think also tiredness because actually being an authoritarian leader
*25:35.840- 25:42.380* :  who is running a society where surveillance and keeping a kind of close eye on everyone's
*25:42.460- 25:47.520* :  behavior, also making sure that as little free speech as little opposition to the government as
*25:47.520- 25:52.840* :  possible is allowed into the public sphere. All of these things are also very, very time-consuming
*25:52.840- 25:57.320* :  and very tiring as well. And they also I think make things difficult because one of the reasons I
*25:57.320- 26:01.260* :  think that actually Chinese social media is censored, but not as censored as it might be,
*26:01.620- 26:05.900* :  is one of the few valves left in which people can actually say something about what they think.
*26:05.900- 26:11.320* :  And I think there's an additional problem, which is that essentially there is a real tension
*26:11.420- 26:17.560* :  between two things that I think Xi Jinping wants to do. And that is between wanting to basically turn
*26:17.560- 26:22.400* :  China into this Renaissance country that's going to be a major power in the 21st century.
*26:22.920- 26:27.120* :  And that really demands openness in a whole variety of ways. You need to have free flow of
*26:27.120- 26:31.960* :  intellectual ideas, intellectual property and thinking across China's borders. You need more
*26:31.960- 26:36.500* :  investment coming in rather than scaring it off. And you need to be sort of whole-hearted and
*26:36.500- 26:41.500* :  actually enlistening rather than tell mode when it comes to international institutions like the
*26:41.820- 26:45.700* :  United Nations. And China hasn't been very good at any of those things. At the same time,
*26:45.700- 26:51.460* :  it's also the case that China is looking inward in a big way at the moment.
*26:52.520- 26:58.040* :  Xi is a product of the cultural revolution of the 60s when he grew up. And somehow that seems to
*26:58.040- 27:02.000* :  have shaped him into the view that if you don't watch out, there's a sort of danger behind every
*27:02.000- 27:06.900* :  tree, a foreign spy and internal dissident. And in fact, China has always been its best and most
*27:06.900- 27:11.080* :  productive in the last half century. When it was still an authoritarian state, there's no doubt
*27:11.080- 27:15.380* :  about that. There were political prisoners and torture and all sorts of things. But there were also
*27:15.380- 27:20.120* :  attempts to create civil society. There were sort of media outlets that could actually do real
*27:20.120- 27:26.040* :  investigative journalism. There was social media that had real power and had feminist movements,
*27:26.040- 27:31.160* :  had environmental movements, all of that. Most of that has disappeared in the last 10 years.
*27:31.420- 27:35.180* :  And I think trying to juggle that with being a genuinely global society,
*27:35.740- 27:39.440* :  yes, that is a very tiring thing to do because frankly, I don't think that in that form,
*27:39.440- 27:45.240* :  it's very easily sustainable. A lot for Xi Jinping to talk about. Oh,
*27:45.240- 27:49.800* :  Celia, before we go, we know there was one thing that definitely drives him around the band. And it
*27:49.800- 27:56.700* :  is memes of Winnie the Pooh and social media. The rutan, honey loving bear character.
*27:56.820- 28:01.340* :  Absolutely. To the point where apparently the rumor is that he's gone on a diet to reduce
*28:01.340- 28:06.200* :  his resemblance to Winnie the Pooh. This all came out from when Xi Jinping went to visit the
*28:06.200- 28:11.320* :  United States. And he was seen walking with then President Barack Obama. Good morning.
*28:17.740- 28:22.680* :  And you know, because Barack Obama is so tall and slim and Xi Jinping, especially at that point,
*28:22.680- 28:28.160* :  was quite rotund and is quite a bit shorter than Obama. Someone released the meme of
*28:28.160- 28:33.780* :  Tigger walking with Winnie the Pooh. And that just repeated itself over and over and over again,
*28:33.780- 28:37.980* :  many people. And then it kind of leaked out that the foreign ministry, the Chinese foreign
*28:37.980- 28:43.280* :  ministry, didn't like Winnie the Pooh pictures being leaked onto social media. And then it just
*28:43.280- 28:48.220* :  kind of continued over and over again. So yes, Winnie the Pooh is something that Xi Jinping really
*28:48.220- 28:51.440* :  hates. It's basically been removed from the Chinese internet. Absolutely.
*28:54.220- 28:58.300* :  Well, thank you for planting lots of interesting memes in our brains today. Rana, thank you very
*28:58.300- 29:01.800* :  much. Thank you very much, Adam. And Celia, thanks to you too. Thank you.
