*01:01.000- 01:08.520* :  a story. Today, who will actually decide the US election?
*01:11.560- 01:17.900* :  There are more than 160 million registered voters. And yet, it's going to only be 100,000
*01:17.900- 01:22.940* :  Americans give or take who decide whether it's going to be Joe Biden or Donald Trump.
*01:23.020- 01:29.200* :  With no major surprises on Super Tuesday and with Nikki Haley dropping out of the race,
*01:29.200- 01:33.400* :  we can be almost certain as to who'll be on the ballot in November.
*01:33.400- 01:41.760* :  The choice is clear. Donald Trump's campaign is about him, not America, not you. Biden,
*01:43.120- 01:48.000* :  the worst president. Is the worst president? Is the most incompetent president?
*01:48.860- 01:53.560* :  Billions of dollars will be spent to sway the outcome. And a lot of that money will be
*01:53.560- 01:59.660* :  spent chasing a tiny number of voters in a small number of counties in just a few states.
*02:00.520- 02:03.660* :  They will get to pick the most powerful man in the world.
*02:08.180- 02:12.320* :  Well, the line you heard earlier that just 100,000 voters could decide the election came
*02:12.320- 02:19.120* :  from a friend of this podcast, the BBC's special US correspondent, Katty Kaye. Hi, Katty, how are you?
*02:19.340- 02:22.700* :  Hey, James. Good to have you on the program. There is a lesson here, of course. If you say
*02:22.700- 02:27.340* :  something interesting on the podcast, you know that we write it down and you know that we're going
*02:27.340- 02:30.600* :  to come and follow you up and say you know that one thing you said you might have thrown it away.
*02:30.860- 02:35.620* :  Well, that's an entire episode for us. So it's my fault. Okay. Yeah, exactly.
*02:35.620- 02:40.000* :  Precisely. Now watch who we spend the next half hour wriggling out of that one.
*02:40.500- 02:43.700* :  Yeah. And try not to say anything interesting so that you don't have to do a new podcast
*02:43.700- 02:49.160* :  created on the one thing you say in the previous one. We've also got Eli Yockley, a political
*02:49.160- 02:53.840* :  analyst from the polling and data firm on in concept, who's been looking closely at the state
*02:53.840- 02:59.040* :  and the voters that will decide this election. How are you, Eli? Hey, I'm very good. Good to be here.
*02:59.560- 03:06.080* :  It is great to have you on the podcast. Well, we've just had super Tuesday, Biden and Trump,
*03:06.080- 03:12.020* :  familiar names, of course, secured the backing of primary voters in 14 states each. We are
*03:12.960- 03:19.720* :  as certain as we can be that barring asteroids, meteors, alien invasions and apocalypses.
*03:20.280- 03:25.760* :  They will be the candidates in November. So attention now turns to that election. Let's start
*03:25.760- 03:31.500* :  with that point that Cathy raised. Why the election could be decided by such a small number of
*03:31.500- 03:37.360* :  people. It all comes down to the electoral college. And Cathy, I sat in the studio for ages
*03:38.200- 03:43.060* :  just now trying to write up my own kind of bite-sized definition of the electoral college that I
*03:43.060- 03:47.200* :  could be proud of that will make everyone understand it that I could give a standing on one leg
*03:47.200- 03:56.860* :  in a lift. But I thought why bother when we've got you. Is this where I can punt it straight to
*03:56.860- 04:02.360* :  Eli and say could he explain the electoral college in such a way that our dear listeners in
*04:02.420- 04:08.800* :  middle England and middle Europe and middle Asia understand that the American electoral system
*04:08.800- 04:14.320* :  is complicated in some would say pretty undemocratic in many ways. And what happens is that every
*04:14.320- 04:22.080* :  state gets to elect a certain number of electors who then go to Washington after the presidential
*04:22.120- 04:29.300* :  election and cast their ballots for whoever has won their state. Those people are known as the
*04:29.300- 04:36.600* :  electoral college. And you have to get to 270 electoral college votes. If I lost everyone already,
*04:36.600- 04:42.100* :  you have to get to 270 electoral college votes, which is really all you need to remember in order
*04:42.100- 04:49.400* :  to win the White House. And each state, depending on the size of its population, has a certain number
*04:49.400- 04:54.940* :  of these electoral college electors. And there are certain states that will give you large numbers
*04:54.940- 04:58.380* :  of electors. And then there are certain states that will give you small number of electors.
*04:58.760- 05:03.920* :  But what we're really interested in for the purposes of this podcast and for this election really
*05:03.920- 05:10.260* :  are the few states that change from going democratic to Republican. Democratic to Republican.
*05:10.880- 05:15.940* :  Depending on the cycle, they are called the swing states. And it is those swing states that decide
*05:15.940- 05:20.440* :  the election because California is always going to be democratic. And Texas for the moment is always
*05:20.440- 05:24.660* :  going to be Republican. What you want to win is those states that are really up for grabs.
*05:25.280- 05:28.900* :  I love it that you say, I'm going to punt on this. And then you decide, no, you know what?
*05:28.900- 05:33.880* :  Yeah, I thought that was too feeble at the beginning of the podcast and I'd give you a break.
*05:33.880- 05:38.900* :  And then I can then I can reserve my punting rights. Yeah, you get those to the second quarter.
*05:39.760- 05:45.660* :  Can you win that popular vote, but lose the presidency in the electoral college? Does that ever
*05:45.660- 05:53.820* :  happen? You can and you do. For the last several elections, Democrats have won the popular vote,
*05:53.820- 05:58.820* :  but even in cases where they haven't won the presidency, they've lost the electoral college vote.
*05:58.820- 06:05.620* :  One exception was George W. Bush in 2000, a rare Republican in the last three decades to win
*06:05.620- 06:11.300* :  both the electoral college vote. And the popular vote increasingly, the pattern in America is that
*06:11.920- 06:17.560* :  Democrats can almost pretty much rely on winning the popular vote. Because if you were just to
*06:17.560- 06:23.500* :  kind of have an election in which it's first passed the post right across the country, forget about
*06:23.500- 06:28.720* :  the states, forget about the electoral college, there are more people voting democratic in this
*06:28.720- 06:34.500* :  country than there are people voting Republican. But because of this curious system of having to
*06:34.500- 06:40.480* :  win a state and then win the presidency as it were, you can win the White House without winning
*06:40.480- 06:46.360* :  the popular vote. And the expectation is that in November, Joe Biden is likely to win the
*06:46.360- 06:51.640* :  popular vote if recent history holds up. But we don't know whether he's going to win this magic
*06:51.640- 07:00.560* :  number of 270 electoral college votes. I imagine Eli, you wake up in the morning with the number
*07:00.560- 07:08.800* :  270 in your head. It's a tattoo on my arm. Oh, the thing is, a lot of these votes, a lot of
*07:08.800- 07:12.860* :  these states are already decided. And so, I mean, that's what we're going to be watching play out
*07:12.860- 07:18.080* :  over the coming months now that we have basically nominees is there's not a lot of attention from a
*07:18.080- 07:23.260* :  lot of these candidates given to many of these other states. I mean, I'm from Missouri, which is since,
*07:23.260- 07:29.220* :  you know, Obama's first election has become a very reliably read state since that's become very
*07:29.220- 07:35.440* :  read. It's the only time the show me state ever saw presidential candidates was Republicans flying
*07:35.440- 07:42.360* :  into St. Louis to raise a bunch of money. It's the same thing in many ways with Democrats in places
*07:42.360- 07:49.540* :  like California and New York. And so the downside to it is a lot of these states are sort of
*07:49.540- 07:56.060* :  omitted from the presidential campaign at some point. You know, the American people are somewhat
*07:56.060- 08:02.740* :  divided on the electoral college. We checked it on this after the 2020 election and 45% of motor
*08:02.740- 08:08.040* :  support and 38% oppose it. But it's not something that a lot of folks care about or want to change
*08:08.040- 08:18.800* :  maybe until it can become selection though. When you look back, the states or districts that
*08:18.800- 08:23.440* :  swing elections, well, they're easy to spot when you got the figures. In 2020, the candidates,
*08:23.980- 08:27.360* :  the same guys as this time, may clear which states matter to them.
*08:27.540- 08:30.980* :  Hello, Florida. We love Florida.
*08:31.160- 08:34.560* :  Florida North Carolina. It's great to be here in Michigan.
*08:34.560- 08:37.280* :  Hello, Michigan. It's great to be back in Florida.
*08:37.320- 08:40.180* :  We're here in the great state of Arizona. We're here in Wisconsin.
*08:40.180- 08:46.120* :  Hello, Wisconsin. We're back. We're back. We're going to win. We're going to win this state.
*08:47.040- 08:50.100* :  One state appeared to matter the most.
*08:50.360- 08:52.480* :  Hello, Pennsylvania. Hello, Pennsylvania.
*08:52.480- 08:55.660* :  Hello, Pennsylvania. Let's go, Pennsylvania.
*08:57.100- 08:57.920* :  Joseph Phillips.
*08:58.540- 09:00.420* :  Well, I'm a screen guy.
*09:01.180- 09:02.880* :  Early voting is open here in Pennsylvania.
*09:02.880- 09:04.780* :  Right here in Western Pennsylvania.
*09:05.100- 09:08.500* :  Pennsylvania has been very important to me. I went to school in Pennsylvania.
*09:08.500- 09:12.600* :  I'm from 2446 North Washington Avenue and I'm happy to be home.
*09:12.600- 09:18.120* :  That was 2020. We're in 2024.
*09:18.820- 09:20.720* :  Katty, which states will matter this time?
*09:21.500- 09:23.640* :  Well, it's all about, as we said, that map.
*09:23.640- 09:28.680* :  And during the course of the next six months, both campaigns will spend a lot of time
*09:28.680- 09:34.040* :  pouring through data to work out if we put together this jigsaw puzzle of
*09:34.380- 09:38.340* :  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona, can we make it?
*09:38.800- 09:45.520* :  Or if we put together Nevada and Michigan and Georgia and Wisconsin,
*09:45.520- 09:46.640* :  can we make it then?
*09:46.700- 09:50.700* :  And they'll be literally trying to see if I can get this state, I get this many votes.
*09:50.760- 09:52.540* :  If I get this state, I get this many votes.
*09:52.540- 09:56.560* :  And I add those to my total and I get to 270, five or six states.
*09:56.560- 09:59.620* :  That's been the margin between the winner and the loser.
*10:00.040- 10:05.100* :  Yeah, I mean, every month we've seen Joe Biden is trailing Trump and Arizona,
*10:05.100- 10:08.520* :  Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.
*10:09.380- 10:11.540* :  These are going to be the key states we're watching this year.
*10:12.120- 10:15.660* :  Trump's lead is the widest right now that we've measured.
*10:15.660- 10:18.620* :  It's in Arizona and Pennsylvania.
*10:19.380- 10:21.700* :  He's just beating Joe Biden by six percentage points.
*10:21.700- 10:24.340* :  They're just like he is in Georgia and Nevada.
*10:24.340- 10:27.700* :  These were key states to Joe Biden's electoral college victory.
*10:28.240- 10:31.000* :  He's going to need to make up ground in those states.
*10:31.520- 10:35.620* :  In some ways, that's an easier task than what Donald Trump has moving forward
*10:35.620- 10:39.980* :  to try to revive the same kind of voters who backed him for years ago.
*10:39.980- 10:42.140* :  And Donald Trump is going to be out of the campaign trail.
*10:42.620- 10:46.060* :  Being heard by voters, that might work to his detriment moving forward.
*10:46.600- 10:47.660* :  Here's a fun fact, Fute.
*10:47.700- 10:52.040* :  The spending on the last US presidential election in 2020, I was just doing the maths,
*10:52.840- 10:54.220* :  was about $14 billion.
*10:55.500- 10:59.300* :  If you think that it's about 100,000 voters who really matter,
*10:59.880- 11:03.360* :  that is the grand total of $140,000 per voter.
*11:04.100- 11:05.720* :  Could they just wire the cash to each voter?
*11:06.040- 11:08.960* :  If they could, I could just move to Wisconsin.
*11:08.980- 11:10.200* :  Actually, good ideas.
*11:10.200- 11:13.080* :  Why haven't we thought of this and then get them to wire us money?
*11:16.200- 11:19.100* :  Looking back in time, I focused much of my life on
*11:19.460- 11:23.640* :  trying to recreate the West Wing when I'm off air and in living that is my framework.
*11:23.700- 11:26.200* :  And I remember in one of the final episodes,
*11:26.200- 11:28.260* :  the defeated candidates was thinking,
*11:28.260- 11:29.880* :  what should he do after he lost the election?
*11:30.280- 11:34.920* :  And he decided that he might take professorship in Florida, Pennsylvania, or Ohio.
*11:35.560- 11:37.180* :  Because those were the swing states at the time.
*11:37.180- 11:39.900* :  That was back in 2006 in the funny West Wing world,
*11:39.900- 11:43.300* :  in which I still live in and have not updated any cultural references since.
*11:43.380- 11:45.420* :  But we haven't mentioned some of those states.
*11:45.420- 11:47.160* :  Eli, they do change then over time.
*11:47.900- 11:49.020* :  Yeah, I definitely do.
*11:49.140- 11:53.420* :  I mean, we wouldn't have been talking about necessarily Georgia eight years ago.
*11:53.860- 11:58.280* :  Florida is one of those places that has turned pretty red in recent years.
*11:58.280- 12:00.800* :  It's one of more conservative states in the country with a very
*12:01.180- 12:03.620* :  pretty popular Republican governor down there.
*12:03.960- 12:07.420* :  Ohio, we see is pretty far off the map.
*12:07.420- 12:10.160* :  That might be something that started before Trump.
*12:10.440- 12:14.560* :  But his ability to fire up the white working class,
*12:15.220- 12:18.480* :  economic, concerned base with some racial component too,
*12:19.000- 12:22.020* :  has really helped take Ohio off the map.
*12:22.380- 12:26.300* :  How does a state go from being a solid state in one category or another
*12:26.840- 12:29.000* :  to a swing state has happened with Georgia?
*12:29.820- 12:30.900* :  I mean, it happens pretty quick.
*12:31.540- 12:35.420* :  Voters are able to react to circumstances they see.
*12:36.020- 12:39.040* :  Part of that is the campaign's ability to identify them
*12:39.080- 12:42.260* :  in some of these key counties that have pivoted.
*12:42.260- 12:45.440* :  I mean, we saw the suburban flip in 2018,
*12:45.440- 12:49.340* :  where Democrats were able to pick up votes
*12:50.180- 12:53.560* :  from women educated folks in the suburbs who make more money
*12:53.560- 12:56.880* :  who were disgusted by what they were seeing out of Donald Trump.
*12:56.880- 13:00.220* :  The Biden campaign in 2020 was able to build on that.
*13:00.220- 13:03.460* :  It had helped them flip places in like Arizona too.
*13:03.460- 13:04.900* :  There are parts of Pennsylvania.
*13:05.800- 13:07.760* :  The question is whether it sticks.
*13:07.760- 13:10.840* :  I mean, the American electorate is so
*13:11.520- 13:12.900* :  partisan these days.
*13:12.900- 13:17.100* :  It's really hard to find voters who are swayable.
*13:17.360- 13:20.500* :  And they happen to dislike both of the candidates right now.
*13:20.780- 13:22.140* :  I mean, I think the Cook Political Reports
*13:22.140- 13:25.520* :  Amy Walters has talked a lot about the so-called double haters.
*13:25.520- 13:29.340* :  These people who have unfavorable views of both candidates.
*13:30.000- 13:33.280* :  That share of the electorate looks as big as it was in 2016
*13:33.280- 13:37.880* :  when voters did not like Donald Trump and did not like Hillary flinted.
*13:41.220- 13:44.200* :  Katini La, you've both given us the roadmap then.
*13:44.660- 13:46.820* :  Where to look for swing voters.
*13:46.820- 13:50.900* :  At Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, maybe
*13:51.240- 13:52.900* :  at Nevada and North Carolina.
*13:53.520- 13:55.960* :  Next, the voters themselves.
*14:02.200- 14:04.620* :  It all started with me asking my friends and family
*14:04.620- 14:06.600* :  to write letters to my daughter, Coco,
*14:07.180- 14:08.240* :  sharing their experiences
*14:08.780- 14:10.540* :  and giving her advice for her life ahead.
*14:11.240- 14:13.220* :  The idea blossomed into dear daughter
*14:13.460- 14:15.120* :  from the BBC World Service.
*14:15.120- 14:17.720* :  The podcast where, with the help of your letters,

*15:50.340- 15:53.060* :  Now, onto those swing voters themselves.
*15:53.060- 15:54.780* :  Katty, we know where they live.
*15:55.440- 15:56.920* :  You've told us, but who are they?
*15:56.920- 15:59.200* :  Would you recognize them if they were walking down the street?
*15:59.940- 16:00.940* :  It's hard to say right.
*16:00.940- 16:05.740* :  I can zoom in and at 433 W Street in the suburbs of Philadelphia.
*16:05.740- 16:08.820* :  There is a housewife who is a swing voter.
*16:09.400- 16:11.640* :  Because actually it's this kind of weird,
*16:11.640- 16:14.700* :  bomorphous group of dissatisfied people
*16:15.420- 16:18.080* :  who could go either way and who could go either way
*16:18.080- 16:20.520* :  depending on what's been in the news that week,
*16:21.300- 16:23.280* :  which means that one thing we do know is that the next
*16:23.400- 16:25.140* :  seven or eight months are going to be very volatile
*16:25.140- 16:27.960* :  because I think the polls will continue to reflect
*16:28.720- 16:30.480* :  what has been happening in the news in that moment.
*16:30.480- 16:32.760* :  At the moment, immigration is driving people
*16:33.340- 16:35.160* :  to say that they would rather have Donald Trump.
*16:35.800- 16:39.800* :  Biden's conduct on our border is by any definition,
*16:39.800- 16:43.940* :  a conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America.
*16:43.940- 16:45.780* :  You know, folks, my first day is president.
*16:46.360- 16:48.000* :  I introduced a bill I sent to Congress,
*16:48.000- 16:51.820* :  a comprehensive plan to fix the broken immigration system
*16:52.380- 16:53.400* :  and to secure the border.
*16:54.140- 16:55.240* :  But no action was taken.
*16:56.040- 16:58.160* :  Eli mentioned earlier the double haters,
*16:58.160- 17:00.340* :  which kind of sounds like a Taylor Swift song,
*17:00.380- 17:03.120* :  but has become the jargon of this election.
*17:03.120- 17:07.800* :  And they are voters who are dissatisfied with Joe Biden
*17:08.320- 17:11.120* :  and voters who are dissatisfied with Donald Trump.
*17:11.120- 17:16.100* :  And therefore could jump potentially to one side or another
*17:16.520- 17:19.660* :  or could jump to a third party candidate or could stay home.
*17:20.320- 17:24.700* :  We think they make up about 19, 20% of the electorate.
*17:25.020- 17:27.560* :  That's a big group of people because in 2020,
*17:27.560- 17:29.940* :  they were only about 5% of the electorate.
*17:30.020- 17:33.520* :  Amazing to hear that there's that concept of floating voters
*17:33.520- 17:35.360* :  because, of course, looking back,
*17:35.360- 17:37.760* :  this is the first election, what's since 1892,
*17:38.140- 17:40.560* :  between two people who've already done the job.
*17:41.480- 17:43.260* :  We know what each man is like as president.
*17:43.260- 17:47.440* :  So Eli, who becomes an up for grabs swing voter
*17:48.080- 17:52.400* :  in a rematch between two very, very known quantities?
*17:52.940- 17:55.480* :  Because these two candidates have run against each other
*17:55.820- 17:58.280* :  before we have a pretty good idea
*17:58.280- 17:59.840* :  what these voters look like.
*17:59.840- 18:02.240* :  The kinds of voters Joe Biden needs to win right now.
*18:02.240- 18:05.800* :  He is not leading Donald Trump in most public surveys.
*18:06.360- 18:08.740* :  And a lot of that's due to the fact that he's weaker
*18:08.740- 18:12.060* :  among his own 2020 voters than Donald Trump
*18:12.060- 18:14.220* :  is among his voters.
*18:14.880- 18:17.640* :  There's more women among these double haters
*18:17.640- 18:20.140* :  than we've seen since ever,
*18:20.140- 18:22.120* :  since we started tracking this in 2016.
*18:22.840- 18:25.040* :  There's more young people, especially Gen Z,
*18:25.040- 18:26.880* :  who doesn't love the president's handling
*18:26.880- 18:29.440* :  of the Israel Hamas war.
*18:29.820- 18:31.300* :  There's also a number of Republicans
*18:31.300- 18:34.460* :  who are not thrilled about Donald Trump's
*18:34.680- 18:36.780* :  reasscendence in the Republican party,
*18:36.780- 18:38.800* :  the kind of folks who are out there supporting
*18:39.420- 18:42.300* :  Nikki Haley throughout the primary process.
*18:42.380- 18:44.160* :  These voters are going to be very decisive
*18:44.540- 18:45.560* :  as we move forward.
*18:45.560- 18:47.160* :  And Katty's very right, by the way,
*18:47.180- 18:49.340* :  this is going to be a very volatile year
*18:49.820- 18:50.420* :  the next year.
*18:50.420- 18:53.000* :  The American public has not been paying attention to this
*18:53.480- 18:55.780* :  like the political class in Washington has.
*18:55.780- 18:59.040* :  They don't know every piece of Donald Trump's
*18:59.240- 19:01.880* :  multiple serious legal problems.
*19:01.880- 19:04.440* :  They don't know every single thing that he said.
*19:04.940- 19:06.380* :  But they are starting to pay attention.
*19:06.780- 19:09.040* :  And especially among some of these conservative voters,
*19:09.040- 19:11.460* :  old school Republicans like the Mitt Robbins
*19:11.460- 19:13.480* :  of the world in these swing states.
*19:13.480- 19:16.740* :  I mean, we've noticed them sort of voters organically
*19:16.780- 19:20.580* :  mentioning things like NATO in Trump's comments on that.
*19:20.720- 19:21.680* :  NATO is busted.
*19:22.200- 19:24.640* :  One of the presidents of a big country stood up
*19:24.640- 19:27.420* :  and said, well, Sarah, if we don't pay
*19:27.880- 19:30.780* :  and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?
*19:30.780- 19:32.180* :  I said, you didn't pay?
*19:32.760- 19:33.460* :  You're delinquent?
*19:34.340- 19:36.440* :  You said, yes, let's say that happened.
*19:36.880- 19:38.200* :  No, I would not protect you.
*19:38.200- 19:41.340* :  In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.
*19:41.340- 19:41.940* :  You got to pay.
*19:42.460- 19:43.520* :  You got to pay your bills.
*19:44.980- 19:47.940* :  The issue of the day is going to matter a lot moving forward.
*19:47.940- 19:50.540* :  And that's why this economic improvement
*19:50.540- 19:52.340* :  that the president is going to need to lean into highlighting
*19:52.340- 19:55.280* :  that, and the immigration discussion we're having right now
*19:55.280- 19:56.720* :  is clearly dragging him down.
*19:57.360- 20:02.420* :  Katty do non-swing status, the vast majority of the population.
*20:02.520- 20:05.900* :  Do they ever get a bit jealous of these 100,000 people
*20:05.900- 20:06.800* :  you're talking about?
*20:06.940- 20:09.260* :  Or are they rather relieved to be avoiding all the fuss?
*20:10.160- 20:12.500* :  There is a saying, particularly amongst Democrats,
*20:12.500- 20:15.420* :  that maps don't vote people do.
*20:16.140- 20:17.720* :  And what they're sort of protesting there
*20:17.720- 20:21.440* :  is the fact that in California, large numbers of people
*20:21.440- 20:22.040* :  will vote.
*20:22.040- 20:24.540* :  But because the state always leans Democratic,
*20:24.580- 20:26.680* :  people feel slightly disenfranchised.
*20:26.680- 20:30.400* :  They feel that their vote doesn't matter as much as somebody in Michigan.
*20:31.040- 20:32.700* :  I think that by the end of the election,
*20:32.700- 20:34.880* :  once you've had these, whatever it was,
*20:34.880- 20:39.020* :  we said, $140,000 spent on you in political advertising.
*20:39.640- 20:41.580* :  And you've been bombarded day and night
*20:41.580- 20:44.680* :  with campaign ads and visits from candidates
*20:44.680- 20:46.220* :  and more campaign ads.
*20:46.640- 20:49.000* :  You're probably fairly sick of being a swing stator.
*20:49.120- 20:50.780* :  Yeah, it must be pretty draining.
*20:50.980- 20:53.500* :  It's a long, exhausting process of turning
*20:53.500- 20:55.960* :  on your television, seeing yet another negative ad
*20:55.960- 20:59.320* :  about Donald Trump or yet another negative ad about Joe Biden.
*21:03.060- 21:05.960* :  So we know where the swing states are
*21:06.500- 21:08.080* :  in this particular election.
*21:08.080- 21:12.960* :  And we know roughly who that 100,000 people are made up of.
*21:13.420- 21:16.380* :  How then we want to know now are the campaigns trying
*21:17.220- 21:18.500* :  to get them on board?
*21:18.600- 21:20.120* :  Are they ringing them up?
*21:20.560- 21:23.160* :  Or would it be more cost effective for each campaign
*21:23.820- 21:26.660* :  to send an individual campaign worker
*21:27.360- 21:32.300* :  to embed or live with that swing voter from March till November?
*21:33.260- 21:35.500* :  Oh my gosh, the idea of moving in campaign workers
*21:35.500- 21:38.220* :  would probably scare off some swing state voters.
*21:38.480- 21:39.640* :  By the way, I love campaign ads.
*21:39.800- 21:40.540* :  I love negative ads.
*21:40.600- 21:41.360* :  They're fun to watch.
*21:41.360- 21:43.100* :  It's like the fun, fun of the hotEx.
*21:43.340- 21:44.820* :  They are getting better and funnier.
*21:45.120- 21:46.440* :  Here's a question for you.
*21:47.020- 21:50.960* :  And just how far are the radical left and inside the beltway
*21:51.000- 21:53.300* :  bandits willing to go to stop it?
*21:53.300- 21:54.760* :  They are funny and they like work.
*21:54.900- 21:57.640* :  I mean, that's why the campaigns run them so much.
*21:58.140- 21:59.740* :  Is people are very responsive to it.
*21:59.740- 22:01.460* :  It's called negative partisanship.
*22:02.900- 22:06.700* :  They all know they hate him for winning the fight to protect life.
*22:06.840- 22:09.300* :  And negative partisanship attacking the other sides here
*22:09.300- 22:10.660* :  at advantage works.
*22:11.320- 22:13.600* :  And that's going to be the whole job of Biden
*22:13.600- 22:15.900* :  as campaign over the coming several months.
*22:15.980- 22:20.680* :  Is he got to revive this coalition from four years ago.
*22:21.180- 22:24.040* :  In the best way to do that is to remind all these voters
*22:24.040- 22:26.900* :  why they hated Donald Trump in the first place.
*22:26.900- 22:28.840* :  There's something dangerous happening in America.
*22:30.060- 22:32.220* :  There's an extremist movement that does not
*22:32.220- 22:34.000* :  share the basic police in our democracy.
*22:34.980- 22:37.260* :  All of us are being asked right now.
*22:37.920- 22:40.120* :  What will we do to maintain our democracy?
*22:41.000- 22:41.880* :  History's watching.
*22:42.880- 22:44.560* :  But on the other side of that, I mean,
*22:44.560- 22:48.720* :  is the whole messaging war about the current president's age.
*22:48.800- 22:51.960* :  I mean, people are seeing these clips of Joe Biden
*22:52.000- 22:53.520* :  stumbling all the time.
*22:53.700- 22:57.120* :  We saw the images yesterday of Biden stumbling around.
*22:57.120- 23:00.080* :  And honestly, it's sad thing to see.
*23:00.080- 23:01.380* :  You don't want to see anyone do that.
*23:01.380- 23:03.780* :  But it was frustrating because honestly,
*23:04.520- 23:06.960* :  that was symbolic of the state of our country.
*23:07.320- 23:09.160* :  And it's definitely breaking through.
*23:09.160- 23:11.800* :  What I go back home to Missouri is first thing
*23:11.800- 23:15.080* :  people say to me is, do you think Joe Biden
*23:15.080- 23:16.500* :  is as bad as he looks on TV?
*23:17.300- 23:19.680* :  And that's gonna be something he's gonna have to contend with.
*23:19.680- 23:22.780* :  It's why moments like the state of the union matter so much
*23:22.780- 23:24.520* :  in a way that they don't always.
*23:24.520- 23:27.500* :  Is can he give an hour long speech at nine o'clock
*23:27.500- 23:28.920* :  without fumbling through it?
*23:29.320- 23:31.060* :  When the other challenge for the Biden campaign
*23:31.060- 23:33.060* :  in these swing states and these key communities
*23:33.500- 23:36.900* :  is gonna be firing up the kinds of people he needs
*23:36.900- 23:40.340* :  to do some of this traditional knocking on doors
*23:41.080- 23:42.760* :  and meeting voters where they are.
*23:43.220- 23:46.140* :  His problem right now in all of the data we're seeing
*23:46.580- 23:48.320* :  is by some of these young folks
*23:48.400- 23:51.740* :  who traditionally would have been the democratic parties
*23:52.080- 23:54.820* :  round army trying to rev up these voters
*23:54.820- 23:56.260* :  in these key communities.
*23:56.880- 23:59.120* :  He's gonna have to do something moving forward
*23:59.120- 24:00.880* :  and his campaign is gonna have to spend some time
*24:00.880- 24:04.220* :  figuring out how it is to try to revive those folks.
*24:04.220- 24:06.860* :  So do you kind of the hard work of campaigning
*24:06.860- 24:08.640* :  every four years for the presidency?
*24:09.160- 24:11.480* :  This election then looks at to be a sequel.
*24:11.740- 24:14.760* :  The first between the same candidate since the rematch
*24:14.760- 24:19.540* :  between Eisenhower and Stevenson in 1956 in Hollywood.
*24:20.400- 24:23.180* :  Some sequels alike the Godfather Part II.
*24:23.980- 24:25.680* :  Very successful breaking new ground.
*24:25.720- 24:27.540* :  Others alike jaws too.
*24:28.280- 24:31.820* :  A creative abyss and a flop at Cathy,
*24:31.820- 24:33.680* :  which will 2024 be.
*24:33.960- 24:36.040* :  I'm not sure Americans love reruns
*24:36.540- 24:38.680* :  and maybe in the television age reruns
*24:38.720- 24:40.100* :  are inherently a little bit boring.
*24:40.760- 24:43.220* :  We do know that Donald Trump tends to drive up turnout
*24:43.820- 24:45.220* :  partly because people love him and partly
*24:45.220- 24:46.280* :  because people hate him.
*24:46.760- 24:48.880* :  So it's possible that this is going to be a very high
*24:48.880- 24:50.060* :  turnout election.
*24:50.720- 24:53.680* :  The key you were asking about what the Biden campaign
*24:53.680- 24:55.860* :  can do because the volatility at the moment
*24:56.440- 24:57.660* :  is on the democratic side.
*24:58.380- 25:00.300* :  The key is to build an anti-Trump coalition
*25:01.140- 25:02.800* :  and the way they do that they feel
*25:02.800- 25:05.040* :  in my conversations with people from the campaign
*25:05.480- 25:09.060* :  is by goading Donald Trump into being Donald Trump
*25:09.060- 25:10.200* :  at his worst.
*25:11.160- 25:13.200* :  And they will do that as they're starting to do
*25:13.200- 25:15.540* :  on social media by getting him to say
*25:15.540- 25:18.840* :  outrageous offensive things, by pushing his buttons.
*25:19.680- 25:21.280* :  Now that doesn't lead for the most
*25:21.300- 25:23.820* :  edge of high political campaign.
*25:24.500- 25:27.200* :  And I think if that's what the Biden camp feels
*25:27.200- 25:29.240* :  they have to do for the next seven months
*25:29.260- 25:31.520* :  in order to win back those people
*25:31.940- 25:33.600* :  who may be flirting with the idea
*25:34.300- 25:35.200* :  of voting for Donald Trump,
*25:35.200- 25:37.340* :  but probably have more democratic leanings,
*25:37.840- 25:38.660* :  that's what they're going to do.
*25:38.820- 25:41.360* :  So this is going to be hard to predict volatile
*25:42.120- 25:44.500* :  and pretty dirty campaign.
*25:45.280- 25:47.220* :  Eli, a rematch is sequel.
*25:47.220- 25:48.940* :  How does that go down in US history?
*25:49.240- 25:50.540* :  It's going to be a dark year.
*25:50.860- 25:53.280* :  I mean, we have an interesting kind of scary
*25:53.280- 25:55.700* :  constitutional problem with the idea of these trials.
*25:56.320- 25:59.060* :  I think you've seen reporting of the Biden campaign
*25:59.060- 26:02.640* :  not talking about election day as the end of this campaign,
*26:03.300- 26:06.440* :  but about January 6th when the electoral college
*26:06.920- 26:08.620* :  meets being the end of the campaign,
*26:09.260- 26:10.820* :  building off of what we saw happened
*26:10.820- 26:12.660* :  after the last election.
*26:12.700- 26:15.640* :  I think that's a scary moment in American politics.
*26:16.380- 26:19.220* :  And what's going to, these key states
*26:19.220- 26:20.440* :  are going to matter a lot because
*26:20.720- 26:23.700* :  these are going to be decided by so few votes.
*26:27.680- 26:29.820* :  The one thing we haven't talked about
*26:29.860- 26:31.920* :  and I think is probably something way
*26:32.460- 26:34.080* :  on especially the Biden campaign
*26:34.540- 26:38.220* :  is the notion of some of these third party candidates.
*26:39.240- 26:41.420* :  If we go back to the 2016 analogy,
*26:41.460- 26:45.240* :  it was those third party candidates in key states
*26:45.320- 26:46.880* :  and we started by this conversation
*26:46.940- 26:48.480* :  by talking about which were the key states.
*26:48.480- 26:50.740* :  It was third party candidates in key states,
*26:51.360- 26:52.680* :  like Michigan and like Wisconsin,
*26:53.280- 26:56.300* :  that lost Hillary Clinton, the presidency,
*26:57.020- 26:59.760* :  and RFK, Robert Kennedy, Jr.,
*26:59.760- 27:01.460* :  who we have not, people are not hearing a lot about,
*27:01.460- 27:04.900* :  Cornel West, a progressive African-American candidate
*27:04.900- 27:07.920* :  who could appeal to young progressive Democrats.
*27:08.420- 27:10.200* :  They only need to peel away, as Eli says,
*27:10.200- 27:13.460* :  a few thousand voters of these double haters,
*27:13.460- 27:16.860* :  as we've called them, to swing the election one way or another.
*27:19.300- 27:21.080* :  Katty, you know that we said that we listen
*27:21.080- 27:22.480* :  to every word that you say.
*27:23.600- 27:24.760* :  And that some of what you say then
*27:24.760- 27:26.200* :  we make into another episode.
*27:26.600- 27:28.640* :  Well, third party candidates,
*27:29.660- 27:33.200* :  you just created another episode with another of your paragraphs.
*27:33.680- 27:35.000* :  And we will delve into that,
*27:35.000- 27:37.880* :  what, with what Teddy Roosevelt in 1912,
*27:37.880- 27:41.680* :  Ross Perot, 1992, and so on up to Cornel West
*27:41.720- 27:44.340* :  and Robert Kennedy, Jr., if you're up for that.
*27:44.600- 27:47.260* :  You're the historian, so we'll all be asking the questions.
*27:48.200- 27:49.100* :  We can flip.
