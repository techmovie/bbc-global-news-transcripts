*01:00.220- 01:06.760* :  the BBC World Service. I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Thursday, the 14th of March,
*01:06.760- 01:13.080* :  these are our main stories. China has described a potential US ban on TikTok as an act of bullying.
*01:13.260- 01:20.000* :  Israel says it's investigating a strike on a UN Food Distribution Center in Gaza. The Dutch
*01:20.000- 01:25.880* :  popularly-de-jet Vilders has abandoned his bid to become Prime Minister despite his party's
*01:25.940- 01:32.180* :  dramatic victory in last year's election. Also in this podcast,
*01:32.200- 01:44.580* :  the United Nations and brave for seven decades, one man's life well-lived in an iron lung.
*01:48.140- 01:53.260* :  The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that could force the Chinese owners of TikTok,
*01:53.260- 01:59.440* :  the social media platform, to either sell the app or be banned in the US. The measure received
*01:59.440- 02:05.820* :  widespread bipartisan backing. It now goes to the Senate where some lawmakers say they will oppose
*02:05.820- 02:11.640* :  it. The vote increases tensions between Beijing and Washington over who controls technology that
*02:11.640- 02:17.560* :  could affect national security and free speech. The leading House Democrat Hakim Jeffries said
*02:17.560- 02:21.780* :  if the measure is approved by the Senate, US consumers will be more protected.
*02:22.340- 02:28.020* :  I don't support a ban on TikTok. The legislation did not ban TikTok. It's simply a
*02:28.620- 02:35.800* :  the vestiture of TikTok so that this social media platform can be owned by an American company
*02:36.600- 02:44.180* :  that would protect the data and the privacy of the American consumer from malignant foreign
*02:44.180- 02:49.080* :  interests like the Chinese Communist Party. Among those who voted against the bill was the
*02:49.080- 02:54.180* :  Republican Congresswoman from Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who sits on the far right of her party.
*02:54.560- 03:00.600* :  When the government moves into forcing the sale of TikTok, who is going to buy it? Who will be
*03:00.600- 03:07.960* :  the next to control the data of over 170 million Americans? Are we going to trust Mark Zuckerberg
*03:07.960- 03:14.540* :  to control their data? I certainly don't. By the way, most of the time, my post on Facebook
*03:14.540- 03:19.600* :  or Shadow Band, and I certainly don't have the reach on that social media account.
*03:20.160- 03:25.340* :  I spoke to our North America correspondent Nomiya Igbal, so in general, can we say a rare example
*03:25.340- 03:30.140* :  of bipartisan shape in Congress? It's interesting because it was a large majority in the House
*03:30.140- 03:38.720* :  152 to 65. I think for the Republicans, and this was a Republican-led bill, Donald Trump was the
*03:38.720- 03:43.280* :  person who spearheaded this in the first place. Certainly when he was in office saying that TikTok
*03:43.280- 03:48.720* :  was a threat to national security, that's the claim that he made, and then President Biden picked
*03:48.720- 03:55.940* :  up when he was in office as well, agreeing with it. In a sense, because both of them,
*03:56.420- 04:05.080* :  you've got this bipartisan agreement on it. Having said that, it's not been received very well
*04:05.080- 04:09.940* :  by those who use it. I was just outside the White House where there's a protest going on,
*04:09.940- 04:15.580* :  and lots of young people who use it were saying, look, this isn't just some app where we go on to
*04:15.580- 04:19.700* :  look at funny videos and dancing videos and what have you. I've got my business on there,
*04:19.700- 04:25.000* :  I've got my livelihood on there, and if it goes, then that goes. For them, they said to me that
*04:25.000- 04:28.520* :  this was an issue for them when it comes to voting in the election. So they don't seem to,
*04:28.740- 04:33.140* :  or some people at least don't seem to accept what the leading House Democrat and Mr. Jeffries
*04:33.140- 04:38.500* :  was saying, is to protect US consensus and consumers against a middleignant foreign interest,
*04:38.500- 04:43.760* :  like the Chinese Communist Party. What happens next? Well, I think the problem is that they've never
*04:43.760- 04:50.480* :  actually proven any actual evidence that it is a threat in that respect. And this is what TikTok's
*04:50.480- 04:56.380* :  argument is, they say, look, if your concerns that American users' data is being sent to China,
*04:56.380- 05:01.440* :  well, we have this massive firewall which walls off any information going to China is kept within
*05:01.440- 05:06.440* :  servers in the US, although there's been various investigations that suggest that firewalls actually
*05:06.440- 05:11.200* :  poorest and information has got to China. I just want to quote one woman I spoke to outside the
*05:11.200- 05:16.440* :  White House named Lindsay. She said to me, look, if my information is being used in another country,
*05:16.440- 05:23.000* :  fine, I don't care. That's my right. My information for apps used in America has been used here.
*05:23.000- 05:27.440* :  So she said that she wasn't too concerned about that. In terms of what happens next, well,
*05:27.440- 05:31.760* :  it does go to the Senate, but I think it faces an uncertain future because Senators are
*05:31.760- 05:37.500* :  pretty divided about the legislation. Also, I want to add that President Biden has started
*05:37.500- 05:41.680* :  in TikTok account for his election campaign. And Donald Trump has flip-flops saying that he
*05:41.680- 05:46.380* :  doesn't want a ban. I think we can put that down to the fact that they are worried. They might
*05:46.380- 05:51.100* :  miss out on millions and millions of young voters. Nomi Iqbal, in Washington,
*05:51.500- 05:57.000* :  will China describe the potential ban of TikTok in the US as an act of bullying? TikToks
*05:57.000- 06:03.320* :  Beijing-based owners bite dance say they've gone to Great Lens to protect the data of its 170
*06:03.320- 06:08.780* :  million US users. US lawmakers say bite dance has links with the Chinese Communist Party,
*06:09.140- 06:14.140* :  something denied by the company and TikTok. So what's been the reaction in China to the potential
*06:14.140- 06:19.160* :  ban? Here's our China media analyst, Kerry Allen. I've been reading lots of really strong lines
*06:19.160- 06:24.580* :  in Chinese media this week ahead of the House vote on TikTok. For example, the National Global Times
*06:24.580- 06:30.000* :  newspaper was criticizing that the vote was even taking place. It said that scrutiny of the
*06:30.000- 06:36.240* :  platform demonstrated the US's ugly behavior. And it saw the vote as a way of the US seizing TikTok
*06:36.240- 06:41.180* :  and taking it by force from China. Now that the bill has been passed in the US House of Representatives,
*06:41.180- 06:45.060* :  meaning that bite dance has to sell its stake in the app in the next six months,
*06:45.060- 06:50.060* :  it's clear that Chinese social media users are not happy at all. Many have been watching
*06:50.060- 06:54.860* :  the US House vote in real time, despite most foreign media being blocked in mainland China.
*06:55.400- 06:59.940* :  And I'm seeing lots of comments from angry Chinese users at the suggestion that TikTok will either
*06:59.940- 07:06.340* :  have to divest control, sell its US operations, or face a ban in the US. One way they'll use
*07:06.340- 07:11.000* :  is that the vote has left them speechless. And another says that if the US does take ownership
*07:11.000- 07:16.060* :  of TikTok, that will be blatant robbery of the platform. I think it's worth mentioning that we
*07:16.060- 07:22.580* :  have been here before. Back in 2020 former President Donald Trump signed a presidential order directing
*07:22.580- 07:28.040* :  bite dance, the parent company of TikTok, to sell off the social media platform within 90 days
*07:28.040- 07:33.920* :  or face a ban. And at that time, TikTok's founder, Zhang Yi Ming, was heavily criticised in China
*07:33.920- 07:39.660* :  for suggesting that he might divest TikTok's US operations. He did eventually step down as
*07:39.660- 07:44.700* :  chief executive of the firm. And there are people who think that that was because he had shown weakness
*07:44.700- 07:50.000* :  and not had the courage to stand up to the US. They felt that he had never recovered from Chinese
*07:50.000- 07:55.380* :  backlash to this suggestion. Now what I'm seeing today is many Chinese social media users expressing
*07:55.380- 08:01.440* :  confidence that China will not sell off its US TikTok operations. But what they do think is that now
*08:01.440- 08:06.820* :  it's only a matter of time before TikTok leaves the US. And they are conscious that this could
*08:06.820- 08:12.080* :  have a snowball effect. With other countries, particularly those in the West, looking to ban TikTok
*08:12.080- 08:19.280* :  as well, if the US does so. Kerry Allen. Next to Strasbourg in France where the European Parliament
*08:19.280- 08:25.280* :  has approved what it calls a trailblazing law on the use of artificial intelligence or AI.
*08:25.280- 08:30.360* :  The technology allows computers to learn and solve problems almost like human beings.
*08:30.360- 08:37.200* :  The president of the Parliament, Roberta Metzilla, said the new AI rules balance tech innovation
*08:37.200- 08:43.940* :  with respect for people's fundamental rights. The European Parliament voted on the world's most
*08:43.940- 08:51.500* :  advanced artificial intelligence legislation. Our groundbreaking AI law will allow us to be
*08:51.500- 08:59.040* :  world leaders in digital and tech innovation based on EU democratic values because Europe has the
*08:59.040- 09:07.400* :  ability to set the tone worldwide and lead responsibly. The legislation comes in the wake of the
*09:07.400- 09:12.060* :  extraordinary speed at which artificial intelligence is developing, particularly in the field of
*09:12.060- 09:18.180* :  chatboards like ChatGPT. Our technology reporter, Chris Valens, told us about the key elements of
*09:18.180- 09:24.560* :  this new legislation. I mean, the law takes a risk-based approach. So it depends on how risky things are
*09:24.920- 09:29.100* :  essentially in terms of their risk to society, their risk to individuals, in terms of how they
*09:29.100- 09:35.600* :  regulated some unacceptable risks of flat outbound. So for example, the things like emotion recognition
*09:35.640- 09:42.320* :  in the workplace and schools, for example, AI tech that might monitor attention. Also,
*09:42.880- 09:47.860* :  certain kinds of biometric systems, one that got a lot of attention, a lot of debate was the issue
*09:47.860- 09:54.320* :  of live facial recognition and its use and the compromise that was reached in the end was that
*09:55.080- 10:00.500* :  law enforcement could use live facial recognition cameras and that sort of thing, but only in the case
*10:00.560- 10:04.860* :  of the most serious crimes. Then you go to the next tier of risk, which is high risk things,
*10:05.540- 10:09.600* :  and there it depends on you. Now, AI is used in lots of different fields, all of which can have
*10:09.600- 10:15.080* :  a big impact on people's lives. So for example, medical use is an employment, uses in critical
*10:15.080- 10:21.400* :  infrastructure and there there are rules that mandate things like transparency and human oversight
*10:21.420- 10:28.120* :  and then you get into other areas of AI and it's a long list. I don't know, I don't know how much
*10:28.120- 10:34.040* :  tape you have, but essentially you then get things like generative AI. These are the chat bots,
*10:34.040- 10:39.560* :  for example, in terms of the production of images and the production of text, which will be
*10:39.560- 10:44.820* :  fascinated by, you know, they'll have to do things like say, which kind of copyrighted materials
*10:44.820- 10:51.220* :  they used to train those AI. So a lot of artists and a lot of writers are upset about that. So that's
*10:51.220- 10:56.720* :  a very broad brush picture. Chris, these are rules that will have to be followed by European
*10:56.720- 11:04.160* :  union countries. It's fine, for example, if you say to a police force and a democracy, you cannot
*11:04.160- 11:11.580* :  use this particular facial recognition software. However, what about globally, there are all sorts
*11:11.580- 11:17.820* :  of actors and all sorts of states who will not respect this? Well, yeah, the jurisdiction of this
*11:17.820- 11:22.980* :  is interesting. When you talk to lawyers, I was talking to one lawyer who said a lot of companies
*11:22.980- 11:27.540* :  might choose to comply with it even if they don't have a particularly big footprint in the EU
*11:27.940- 11:32.640* :  because as a chance their tech could be used by say another company in the EU and then it might
*11:33.580- 11:39.620* :  become subject to the act. And we did get one statement from a vice president at IBM who said,
*11:39.620- 11:44.640* :  I commend the EU for its leadership in passing comprehensive smart legislation, so broadly
*11:44.640- 11:51.560* :  positive from them. So when it comes to countries, I suppose China comes to mind using AI, using facial
*11:51.560- 11:58.920* :  recognition technology quite extensively. What plans do they have to regulate AI? There are a number
*11:58.920- 12:05.760* :  of announcements and regulations that have been made by the various Chinese bodies involved in
*12:05.760- 12:10.000* :  regulating tech, so they've made announcements. Also, of course, there were moves that the G7
*12:10.000- 12:17.380* :  meeting where cooperation on AI regulation was raised and there were broad agreements and positive
*12:17.380- 12:23.160* :  noises made about that. Again, the summit in the UK, organised by the UK government, various
*12:23.160- 12:28.420* :  countries committed to broad statements about the risks posed by AI and the need for
*12:28.420- 12:35.380* :  regulation. So countries around the world are taking steps to regulate AI, but the EU,
*12:35.960- 12:39.800* :  as far as it's concerned, has taken the lead. Chris Valance
*12:41.000- 12:46.940* :  Israel says it's looking into an attack on a United Nations Food Distribution Centre in Raffa City.
*12:47.700- 12:53.300* :  The UN Agency for Palestinian Refugee says one of its staff was killed in an apparent Israeli
*12:53.300- 12:58.520* :  air strike on the centre. Four others died and more than 20 were injured in the incident.
*12:58.520- 13:04.060* :  Well, the head of the UN Agency, Philippe Latsarini, said the strike was carried out despite
*13:04.060- 13:09.840* :  the location of the centre being given to Israeli forces on Monday. At a US State Department
*13:09.840- 13:14.740* :  Media briefing in Washington, the American Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, called on Israel
*13:14.740- 13:19.500* :  to ensure aid workers were protected. The Israeli military, the Israeli government,
*13:19.500- 13:23.600* :  have a responsibility and obligation to do everything possible to ensure that the
*13:23.600- 13:27.740* :  Americans can do their jobs. And among other things, that means making sure that if there's
*13:27.740- 13:34.120* :  the humanitarian facility that's clearly identified, it's not struck. More than 160 staff from UNRA
*13:34.520- 13:40.060* :  have been killed in Gaza since the war began. And Israeli hostage, who was kidnapped by Hamas
*13:40.060- 13:45.300* :  gunmen during last year's 7th of October attacks, has told the BBC News that the world has
*13:45.300- 13:50.860* :  forgotten about those held captive. Hamas is regarded as a terrorist group by many Western
*13:50.860- 13:56.860* :  governments. Itay Regheve was taken hostage with his sister and his friend from a music festival.
*13:56.860- 14:03.320* :  Our special correspondent Lucy Manning reports. Itay Regheve is free, but all he thinks about
*14:03.320- 14:09.040* :  are the hostages he left behind. The teenager was kidnapped from the Nova music festival with
*14:09.040- 14:15.300* :  his sister Maya and his friend Omar. Itay says they were taken to a house in Gaza with a
*14:15.300- 14:21.100* :  shaft, then through a tunnel and to a hospital, as he and his sister had both been shot in the leg.
*14:21.820- 14:24.240* :  Itay's words are translated by an actor.
*14:28.440- 14:34.660* :  They threatened me with my life. They are going to kill me. They are going to behead me.
*14:36.720- 14:41.640* :  I still had a bullet in my leg. They put the four steps into my leg. They pulled out the
*14:41.640- 14:47.300* :  bullet without anesthetic. They told me to keep quiet because if I won't keep quiet, they'll kill me.
*14:51.600- 14:57.560* :  I came to terms with the fact that I wasn't going to live. I see my sister Maya injured and crying.
*14:58.660- 15:04.020* :  Maya also said her goodbyes and told me if I come out of this alive to tell our parents that she
*15:04.020- 15:09.840* :  loves them. Itay says they didn't know each day if they would be killed by their captors
*15:10.040- 15:15.640* :  or hit by a missile. Sometimes there was no water and they suffered greatly from hunger.
*15:16.600- 15:24.320* :  He was freed after 54 days, a few days after Maya, Omar and around 130 others are still being held.
*15:25.200- 15:31.380* :  The negotiations to release the remaining hostages have stalled. Hamas is demanding a permanent ceasefire
*15:31.780- 15:37.740* :  and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Itay says the Israeli government must do all it can to bring
*15:37.740- 15:45.140* :  the hostages home. Lucy Manning. Russia says it's going to deploy troops and strike systems near
*15:45.140- 15:50.880* :  its border with Finland. It comes after both Finland and Sweden joined NATO, more than doubling the
*15:50.880- 15:55.640* :  length of the alliance's border with Russia. In a wide-ranging interview with state-controlled
*15:55.640- 16:00.960* :  Russian television, a head of this weekend's election. President Putin singled out neighboring
*16:00.960- 16:05.720* :  Finland. He said the decision to join the Western defensive alliance was in his opinion clearly
*16:05.720- 16:09.400* :  against Helsinki's own interest. Alice Adley reports.
*16:09.400- 16:16.740* :  The site of 90,000 troops from 32 countries taking part in NATO's biggest exercise for decades
*16:16.740- 16:23.520* :  in Norwegian waters recently may have concentrated Vladimir Putin's mind when giving his
*16:23.520- 16:29.860* :  interview. For the Russian public, he's always framed his full-scale invasion of Ukraine as a
*16:29.860- 16:36.740* :  defensive military operation against an expanding NATO. This act has made Nordic and Baltic
*16:36.740- 16:42.660* :  countries nervous of the same thing happening to them and has led directly to the accession
*16:42.660- 16:48.300* :  of First Finland and, most recently, historically neutral Sweden to the alliance.
*16:48.460- 16:53.600* :  President Putin singled out Finland, which joined the alliance last year.
*16:53.840- 17:00.260* :  Finland, you know, especially in Germany. We generally had ideal relations with Finland,
*17:00.260- 17:05.280* :  simply ideal. We didn't have a single claim against each other, especially territorial ones,
*17:05.280- 17:10.540* :  not to mention in other areas. We didn't have troops there either. We removed all the troops
*17:10.540- 17:16.200* :  from the Russian-finished border. Why do they do this? Based on purely political considerations
*17:16.260- 17:21.160* :  in my opinion, they really wanted to be members of a Western club under some kind of umbrella.
*17:21.960- 17:24.320* :  Why they needed this, I frankly don't understand.
*17:24.980- 17:31.140* :  The NATO alliance regularly holds drills and membership of what Mr. Putin calls the Western Club
*17:31.140- 17:38.100* :  ensures an attack on a member state means allies will come to its aid. The message from NATO in
*17:38.100- 17:45.320* :  running its exercise operations steadfast defender in the Nordic region is clear. It's prepared to
*17:45.320- 17:52.220* :  defend itself against an increasingly aggressive Russia. Moscow has recently switched its economy
*17:52.220- 17:58.760* :  to war mode, and the fear is, if it makes gains in Ukraine, it may turn its attention to the
*17:58.760- 18:04.120* :  increasingly strategically important mineral-rich Arctic region.
*18:04.120- 18:09.860* :  Alasadely. The far-right Dutch politician, Head Wilders, has failed in his bid to become
*18:09.860- 18:14.500* :  Prime Minister, even though his party emerged as the biggest in last November's elections.
*18:14.500- 18:19.860* :  From the Hague, he is Anaheim. He may have convinced a considerable portion of the Dutch
*18:19.860- 18:25.000* :  electorate, but here at Wilders failed to reassure the other party leaders that he was a suitable
*18:25.000- 18:30.780* :  person to lead the country. Despite promises to put some of his most controversial and
*18:30.780- 18:36.680* :  unconstitutional policies regarding Islam on ice, Mr. Wilders has accepted,
*18:36.680- 18:42.760* :  if he wants a right-wing government, he'll have to sacrifice his own political ambitions to lead it.
*18:43.140- 18:49.520* :  Anaheim. A man from the United States who survived polio and became known as the man in the iron
*18:49.520- 18:54.860* :  lung has died at the age of 78. Paul Alexander, who was from the state of Texas,
*18:55.300- 19:00.980* :  contracted the virus in 1952 and was left paralyzed from the neck down. It's thought he was one of the
*19:00.980- 19:06.540* :  last people in the world to be using an iron lung. That's a metal cylinder that encased his body
*19:06.960- 19:11.460* :  and used air pressure to help him breathe. Eddie Price has been looking back at his life.
*19:11.940- 19:17.740* :  Paul Alexander spent more than 70 years enclosed in a pressurized metal cylinder with just his head
*19:17.740- 19:22.760* :  and neck sticking out. Last year he entered the Guinness World Records as the longest ever iron
*19:22.760- 19:29.080* :  lung patient, but that wasn't his most impressive accolade. After catching polio and he was six,
*19:29.080- 19:34.560* :  he was paralyzed and unable to breathe on his own. Placed in an iron lung, he was not expected
*19:34.560- 19:40.100* :  to survive long. But after several years Paul Alexander taught himself to gulp down air into
*19:40.100- 19:46.040* :  his throat and mastered what he called frog breathing. It meant eventually he could spend short
*19:46.040- 19:51.940* :  periods away from his iron lung, as he explained in his own words in this documentary a few years ago.
*20:05.000- 20:08.320* :  He would go on to earn a law degree, practice law for several decades,
*20:08.380- 20:12.800* :  as well as publish a memoir. His brother Philip said he was an inspiration.
*20:13.420- 20:19.660* :  I've seen him go through a lot of struggles over the years and you know he had a caregiver
*20:19.660- 20:24.120* :  living with him for a good while, but I mean after that she lived down the street. He lived in his
*20:24.120- 20:29.140* :  own house since then he's had his own apartment. I admire him a lot for that.
*20:29.460- 20:34.300* :  A polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s, all but eradicating the disease in the Western
*20:34.300- 20:39.380* :  world shortly after. Advances in medicine made iron lungs obsolete a decade later,
*20:39.940- 20:44.500* :  replaced by other forms of ventilators. But Paul Alexander kept living in the cylinder,
*20:44.500- 20:49.960* :  he called his old iron horse because he said he was used to it. Ellie Price.
*20:52.840- 20:59.560* :  Still to come. It is plausible that in humans the same selected pressures meant that menopause
*20:59.560- 21:03.620* :  evolved in order to produce helpful grandmother's.
*21:04.020- 21:07.460* :  What whales can teach humans about the reason for the menopause?
*21:13.880- 21:18.280* :  It all started with me asking my friends and family to write letters to my daughter Coco,
*21:18.280- 21:23.900* :  sharing their experiences and giving her advice for her life ahead. The idea blossomed
*21:23.900- 21:29.380* :  into dear daughter from the BBC World Service. The podcast where, with the help of your letters,
*21:29.840- 21:33.820* :  I'm creating a handbook to life full of advice for daughters everywhere.
*21:34.760- 21:39.260* :  Listen now by searching for dear daughter wherever you get your BBC podcast.
*21:46.680- 21:52.720* :  After Openheimer's success at the Oscars, why not delve into the history of the atomic bomb
*21:52.720- 21:58.960* :  and key characters from that period of history with a podcast? The bomb from the BBC World
*21:58.960- 22:04.540* :  Service explores the race to beat the Nazis in developing the atomic bomb and the scientists
*22:04.540- 22:11.280* :  and spies who changed history. Listen to the whole series now by searching for the bomb wherever
*22:11.280- 22:22.760* :  you get your BBC podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Next to the crisis in Haiti,
*22:23.560- 22:28.200* :  political instability and violence in the country continues to dominate the lives of the people.
*22:28.200- 22:33.320* :  Despite efforts by regional leaders, including the United States to find a solution to the crisis,
*22:33.820- 22:38.820* :  it is clear that armed gangs are largely in control of the country. They've successfully forced
*22:38.820- 22:43.960* :  the resignation of the Prime Minister, Ariel Henri, who they accuse of corruption and trying to
*22:43.960- 22:49.780* :  cling on to power despite his mandate expiring. Jimmy Barbeque-Sharisier, a former policeman,
*22:49.820- 22:54.480* :  is the most high profile of the gang leaders, but others are challenging him for dominance.
*22:55.660- 23:01.940* :  How are the gangs being financed then? Roma Lecourt of the Geneva-based NGO Global Initiative
*23:01.940- 23:08.560* :  is an expert on violence and organised crime. Because they control, let's say, 80 to 85 percent
*23:08.700- 23:15.140* :  of the country's capital, but also specific and strategic routes, they have been able to extract
*23:15.140- 23:22.960* :  resources and funding through first and foremost extortion. So you have checkpoints operating
*23:22.960- 23:28.720* :  especially different parts of the capital. The capital was and is still absolutely sealed by
*23:28.720- 23:34.180* :  criminal checkpoints. So if you're into logistics business, for example, and you run the truck
*23:34.180- 23:38.740* :  company, the truck company just have to pay the gangs to to operate. It's the same in the port.
*23:38.740- 23:44.940* :  You cannot get anything in and out the terminal without paying Barbeque's group. So they have
*23:44.940- 23:50.000* :  been able just to transform their access to assault rifles, for example, and war weapons, mainly
*23:50.000- 23:56.440* :  and largely from the United States. This firepower has allowed them to better control their territory,
*23:56.440- 24:02.000* :  but also to expand into new activities like kidnappings, for example, kidnappings as a huge
*24:02.380- 24:10.260* :  part of their funding. In some weeks of 2023, people were reporting from 500 to 1,000 kidnappings
*24:10.320- 24:14.600* :  in one week and to pay the ransom, people in Haiti sell everything they have,
*24:14.600- 24:20.520* :  start asking for money around their friends, families, you have people in the diaspora sending
*24:20.520- 24:27.860* :  money in. Let's say if you do 10,000 kidnappings per year and if you're charging just like 5,000
*24:27.860- 24:32.920* :  dollars or 10,000 dollars per kidnapping, this is huge amount of money. And kidnappings have become
*24:32.920- 24:40.960* :  a kind of industry. Rumma Lacour from the Global Initiative Organization in Geneva. Biden versus
*24:41.220- 24:46.900* :  Trump. It is the coming contest, as both candidates have now reached a magic number of delegates
*24:46.900- 24:52.820* :  to become their party's nominee to run for U.S. President. It is the first rematch since Adelaide
*24:52.820- 25:00.440* :  Stevenson versus Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. Things can still derail Biden or Trump making it through
*25:00.440- 25:05.260* :  to November, but we can work on the assumption that the voters know the choice they have to make.
*25:05.860- 25:10.580* :  Many, of course, have made up their minds. Many have not. Particularly, perhaps, those Republicans
*25:10.580- 25:16.540* :  of anti-Trump inclination. The BBC's North America editor, Sarah Smith, has been meeting voters
*25:16.540- 25:22.660* :  in Wisconsin. Breaking overnight, it is official. President Biden and Donald Trump set for 2024
*25:22.660- 25:27.800* :  rematch up. It's a rerun of the 2020 election that is set to be one of the longest presidential
*25:27.800- 25:33.680* :  election campaigns in modern American history. The stage is officially set. Trump versus Biden,
*25:34.200- 25:39.660* :  as the president heads to battlegrounds Wisconsin today. Here in Wisconsin politics already
*25:39.660- 25:45.220* :  dominates the radio talk shows. You're on the Dan O'Donnell show. It's classical conservatism
*25:45.680- 25:49.180* :  and contemporary style. We are partitions for truth here.
*25:51.220- 25:55.760* :  WISN listeners get a daily blast of non-stop high energy right when rhetoric
*25:56.320- 25:59.840* :  from this radio host who is very clear about who he wants to see in the White House.
*26:00.800- 26:09.040* :  Trump is the sun and everything else in the political solar system revolves around him in some way.
*26:09.440- 26:14.200* :  You think he can win the presidential election? Oh, absolutely. Despite all the voters who say
*26:14.200- 26:19.560* :  they'll never vote. Yes. Despite all of that, I mean, I honestly believe that Trump is the
*26:19.560- 26:26.460* :  prohibitive favorite right now. All of the swing state polls show him up in 2020. Trump didn't
*26:26.460- 26:33.780* :  lead in a single swing state poll. Not one. He's now leading in all of them. One campaign group is
*26:33.780- 26:39.500* :  spending $50 million to try to reverse Donald Trump's momentum. Called Republican voters against
*26:39.500- 26:44.780* :  Trump, they've made a series of video testimonials from people who have voted for him in the past,
*26:44.780- 26:50.860* :  explaining why they can't support him this year. My name is Chuck. I live in Atlanta, Georgia.
*26:51.360- 26:56.900* :  My name is Brock Gordero. I'm from Dartmouth, Massachusetts and I did vote for Trump.
*26:57.100- 27:00.500* :  Wasn't the best decision I think I've ever made. I think it's one of my poorest decisions I've
*27:00.500- 27:06.340* :  never made. My name is Cynthia. I am from Pennsylvania. I am a former Trump supporter and voter.
*27:06.340- 27:14.340* :  I will no longer be voting for President Trump. We can survive four years of Biden. I don't know if
*27:14.340- 27:20.900* :  we can survive four years of Trump. There's about 30% of Republican primary voters did not support Donald
*27:20.900- 27:25.080* :  Trump. Now many of them will vote for him in November because he's the Republican candidate.
*27:25.760- 27:30.020* :  The question though is how many will refuse to? In the pretty little Wisconsin time of Walker
*27:30.020- 27:36.080* :  show, I'm at James Wigderson, a lifelong Republican who says he cannot vote for his party's candidate
*27:36.080- 27:43.700* :  this year. Why not? Because the man is a menace. He has a threat to the constitutional order.
*27:43.700- 27:48.020* :  I will probably vote for Joe Biden actually. Really? You'll vote for a Democrat? Yeah,
*27:48.020- 27:55.160* :  it'll be really difficult. I'm not a fan of Joe Biden and we can debate policies and we can debate
*27:55.160- 28:02.180* :  whether or not Joe Biden is a jerk or whether or not he's old but in the end what is the most
*28:02.180- 28:06.060* :  important thing that we have to worry about in this country and that's defending our constitution?
*28:06.060- 28:13.180* :  It's going to be hard but it's necessary. Are there enough Republicans like you who will vote
*28:13.180- 28:16.700* :  against the oil and Trump to stop them getting back into the White House? I hope that there's
*28:16.700- 28:23.400* :  enough Republicans in this state that had enough. They have said that they're not going to support
*28:24.140- 28:30.940* :  Donald Trump in his efforts to just win the election just so he can have his Donald Trump
*28:30.940- 28:35.920* :  to the revenge tour. That's not something that they want to have happened.
*28:36.260- 28:39.840* :  Wisconsin will be one of the few states that determines the election outcome this year.
*28:40.540- 28:46.040* :  voters here backed Donald Trump in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. Each time it was only around
*28:46.040- 28:51.240* :  20,000 votes that made the difference. If Joe Biden can keep hold of enough unhappy Republicans
*28:51.240- 28:54.020* :  here, you may be able to keep hold of the White House.
*28:54.880- 29:01.860* :  Sarah Smith. In March 2011, an earthquake triggered a tsunami in Japan that flooded the Fukushima
*29:01.860- 29:07.600* :  nuclear power plant. 150,000 people were forced to flee the radiation leak that followed.
*29:07.600- 29:13.020* :  The cleanup will take decades but on Wednesday one part of that process got the seal of approval
*29:13.020- 29:19.360* :  from the International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA said the treated radioactive wastewater
*29:19.360- 29:24.820* :  from the plant that's currently being released into the ocean is safe. Rafael Grossy,
*29:24.860- 29:30.540* :  the agency's chief posted a video on X, complete with safety hardhat and the sound of flowing water
*29:30.540- 29:38.180* :  behind him. We are making sure, as we said from the very beginning, that the IAEA would be present
*29:38.940- 29:47.960* :  before, during and after this very important operation and until the last drop of water is
*29:47.960- 29:56.080* :  safely dispersed into the ocean. Nuclear safety can first, the IAEA is here. We will continue
*29:56.080- 30:02.140* :  permanently following this important operation. For more, I spoke to our Asia Pacific Editor,
*30:02.140- 30:08.120* :  Mickey Bristow. Well, this trip was mainly about trying to assess whether or not this process of
*30:08.120- 30:14.120* :  releasing water, which began six months ago, is actually going according to plan. Before Japan
*30:14.120- 30:18.980* :  started releasing the water, it did get the approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
*30:19.880- 30:24.240* :  They said that they were going to be there throughout the process to check independently.
*30:24.240- 30:29.200* :  It was all going according to plan and that's what Rafael Grossy is doing in Japan,
*30:29.200- 30:35.780* :  in Fukushima at the moment and he said exactly that it's safe. It's going well. He was there
*30:35.780- 30:41.500* :  essentially to reassure Japanese people and the rest of the world that nothing was going wrong
*30:41.500- 30:46.800* :  with this process. Mickey, how do they know it's going safely and what tests are being made in the
*30:46.800- 30:51.260* :  waters to make sure it is safe? Well, exactly that, they're doing tests, not just of the water,
*30:51.260- 30:56.500* :  but of the seabed, of the fish, they're periodically carrying out their own tests. They're not just
*30:56.500- 31:02.760* :  relying on TePco, which is the owner of this stricken nuclear power plant. They're doing their own
*31:02.760- 31:09.660* :  tests. So the IAEA is an independent organisation. It has scientists and analysts from across the world
*31:09.660- 31:16.140* :  as it's scientific advisers. So essentially what Rafael Grossy is trying to make the world sees
*31:16.140- 31:21.040* :  it's an independent organisation carrying out its own independent tests in Fukushima so you
*31:21.040- 31:26.560* :  can rely on what it has to say. And yet there are still concerns locally and internationally,
*31:26.560- 31:31.680* :  aren't there? There are still concerns locally. There was a protest a little while ago in Japan
*31:31.680- 31:37.200* :  against this, but interestingly seafood sales haven't been affected in Japan. So that just
*31:37.200- 31:42.900* :  really tells you what majority of people must feel that the seafood from around Japan, from around
*31:42.900- 31:49.800* :  this area is safe. The people who don't really believe what Rafael Grossy is saying, what the
*31:49.800- 31:54.940* :  Japanese are saying are the Chinese. When they started discharging water last August,
*31:55.100- 32:02.600* :  China introduced a ban on all seafood imports from Japan, that's still in place. China doesn't
*32:02.600- 32:09.120* :  look as though it's going to change that. It wants Japan to just stop discharging water into the sea.
*32:09.120- 32:15.960* :  So at the moment, that market has been affected, but China really is an outlier now. Other countries
*32:15.960- 32:22.460* :  are coming to see and even Japanese people that perhaps probably is a safe procedure.
*32:23.020- 32:28.160* :  Mickey Bristo. The eldest son of France's former president, General Shal De Gaulle,
*32:28.160- 32:34.460* :  has died aged 102. The last surviving child of the wartime leader, Philippe de Gaulle,
*32:34.640- 32:37.880* :  became a significant figure in his own right, Warren Bull reports.
*32:37.880- 32:43.140* :  Philippe de Gaulle was a student at the time of the German Nazi invasion of France in 1940.
*32:43.180- 32:48.720* :  He escaped to Britain and joined the free French naval forces. He fought in several significant
*32:48.720- 32:55.080* :  Second World War battles, including the liberation of Paris. Despite that, his father never rewarded him
*32:55.080- 32:59.780* :  the liberation medal given to heroes of the resistance, most likely ever concerns about
*32:59.780- 33:05.380* :  nepotism. Philippe de Gaulle saw active service in post-war conflicts in Indochina and North Africa.
*33:05.780- 33:10.920* :  He wrote an acclaimed book about his father and served as a right-wing senator. In a statement,
*33:10.920- 33:16.680* :  President Emmanuel Macron said Philippe de Gaulle had represented a century of French bravery.
*33:16.680- 33:23.260* :  Warren Bull. It is a mystery that's baffled scientists for decades. Why is it that only humans and
*33:23.260- 33:28.380* :  some species of marine mammals go through the menopause? Although species continue to reproduce
*33:28.380- 33:32.980* :  until the end of their lives, but researchers at the University of Exeter in England now believe
*33:32.980- 33:38.440* :  that a study of killer whales may have provided the answer as to why a small number do not.
*33:39.260- 33:41.320* :  More from our science correspondent, Helen Briggs.
*33:41.940- 33:46.700* :  Killer whales are among the handful of species known to go through the menopause by studying them,
*33:46.700- 33:52.380* :  scientists hope to solve a biological puzzle. In evolutionary terms, stopping reproducing
*33:52.380- 33:57.400* :  partway through your life doesn't make a great deal of sense, given the drive to pass on your genes.
*33:57.400- 34:02.780* :  But researchers at the University of Exeter have discovered the five whale species that go through
*34:02.780- 34:09.320* :  menopause have a longer lifespan. This suggests the menopause evolved to allow grandmother whales
*34:09.320- 34:15.400* :  to help younger generation survive without producing more mouths to feed. Professor Rebecca
*34:15.400- 34:20.540* :  Sier, an anthropologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who's not connected
*34:20.540- 34:24.060* :  with the research, says the same might be true in humans.
*34:24.380- 34:31.240* :  It is plausible that in humans too, the same selective pressures meant that menopause evolved
*34:31.760- 34:36.920* :  in order to produce helpful grandmother's and to reduce reproductive competition between
*34:36.920- 34:41.960* :  generations. The jurists are out on the evolution of human menopause with some suggesting it's
*34:42.040- 34:45.800* :  simply a consequence of living for a long time. Helen Briggs.
*34:48.300- 34:52.400* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.
*34:52.640- 34:56.760* :  If you want a comment on this podcast, all the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*34:56.760- 35:03.580* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on x at Global News Podcast.
*35:03.940- 35:08.740* :  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll, the producer with Liam McChefrey. The editor is
*35:08.740- 35:11.920* :  Karen Morton. I'm Nick Barnes, and until next time, goodbye.
