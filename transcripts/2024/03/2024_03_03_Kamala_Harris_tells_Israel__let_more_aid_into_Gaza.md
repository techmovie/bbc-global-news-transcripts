*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:12.560* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:49.160- 00:56.860* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service and Valerie Sanderson and in the early
*00:56.860- 01:02.800* :  eyes of Monday the 4th of March, these are our main stories. America's Vice President Kamala Harris
*01:02.800- 01:09.100* :  piles pressure on Israel to come to an agreement with Hamas over a ceasefire in Gaza. We're in Haiti
*01:09.100- 01:15.300* :  where armed gangs in portal prints have stormed a prison helping up to 4,000 inmates escape.
*01:18.820- 01:24.420* :  Also in this podcast after a bitterly disputed election campaign, Pakistan has a new Prime Minister.
*01:27.840- 01:33.520* :  It's declared to have been elected as the Prime Minister of Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
*01:34.880- 01:40.300* :  And scientists believe they've solved the mystery about the age of the world's most spectacular
*01:40.900- 01:41.680* :  sand dunes.
*01:46.480- 01:50.840* :  The United States is piling more pressure on Israel to reach an agreement with Hamas for a
*01:50.840- 01:57.280* :  six week ceasefire in Gaza. Speaking on Sunday, the US Vice President Kamala Harris said that Palestinians
*01:57.280- 02:03.080* :  had suffered too much for too long. I must address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
*02:06.020- 02:14.960* :  We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed. Women giving birth to malnourished
*02:14.960- 02:24.300* :  babies with little or no medical care and children dying for malnutrition and dehydration.
*02:26.540- 02:32.160* :  As I have said many times too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.
*02:34.560- 02:37.260* :  There must be an immediate ceasefire.
*02:40.320- 02:46.100* :  Kamala Harris also called on Israel to do more to allow large amounts of aid into Gaza and said
*02:46.100- 02:51.840* :  her mass should release all the hostages. Talks are taking place in Cairo to try to broker a
*02:51.840- 02:57.700* :  truce, but Israel is refusing to send anyone as it wants Hamas to first give a full list of its
*02:57.700- 03:03.560* :  hostages who are still alive. A senior international correspondent Ola Garen is in Israel and
*03:03.560- 03:10.600* :  sent has this report from Tel Aviv. A deal if it comes could be days away. Several sticking points
*03:10.600- 03:18.960* :  remain, including a Hamas demand for Israeli forces to pull out of Gaza. The Hamas delegation is
*03:18.960- 03:26.640* :  in Cairo, along with envoys from Qatar and the US, but without the Israelis. Israel wants
*03:26.640- 03:35.100* :  information on the condition of its 130 hostages in Gaza. It fears that 31 are already dead.
*03:35.980- 03:42.900* :  Unless and until this is provided sources here say it won't send representatives to Cairo.
*03:44.940- 03:49.000* :  For many in Gaza a ceasefire cannot come soon enough.
*03:49.000- 04:01.340* :  In Rafa this was a day of harrowing loss. Palestinians mourning for 14 members of the Abu Anza family,
*04:01.960- 04:09.540* :  most women and children. They were victims of Israeli airstrikes according to hospital officials
*04:09.540- 04:20.400* :  and Gaza's civil defense. There were about 35 people in the house says Faruk Abu Anza who lost relatives.
*04:20.860- 04:31.320* :  Most were children. There were no fighters. The house collapsed on them three or four stories.
*04:31.820- 04:40.880* :  In Israel too many families are in anguish, calling for their loved ones to be freed from the
*04:47.980- 04:54.540* :  tunnels of Gaza. Ial Calderon is desperate to see his cousin offer a father of four. He says the
*04:54.540- 05:01.840* :  past five months have been a torment. It's like a hell you know we are in some of a loop since
*05:01.840- 05:08.740* :  the October 7. We are living this day every day again and again. We have only one goal all
*05:08.740- 05:14.900* :  these days to bring him back alive to his family, to his children. This is the only thing that's
*05:14.900- 05:25.860* :  matter. But there will be no homecoming for the hostages without a ceasefire and no respite for
*05:25.860- 05:32.840* :  those threatened with starvation and death in Gaza. Orlegerin in Israel. The Haitian capital
*05:32.840- 05:38.700* :  Porto Prince is one of the most lawless cities in the world. Armed gangs which control 80 percent
*05:38.700- 05:44.480* :  of the city according to the United Nations are at war with the authorities there. On Saturday they
*05:44.480- 05:50.460* :  broke into the main prison in Porto Prince and freed almost all of the inmates. Haiti's most
*05:50.460- 05:55.520* :  powerful gang leader is nicknamed barbecue and he's got the prime minister in his sights.
*05:58.740- 06:03.040* :  We ask the police and military to arrest Ariel Orle for the liberation of Haiti.
*06:03.580- 06:08.020* :  Haitians are not our enemy. These weapons that we have are not here to hurt our Haitian brothers
*06:08.020- 06:13.700* :  who come from the same places as us. The poor trust us. These weapons are our symbol of freedom.
*06:13.740- 06:18.580* :  With these weapons we will liberate the country and these weapons will change Haiti.
*06:18.920- 06:24.900* :  The storming of the prison in Porto Prince coincided with Mr. Omri's absence in Kenya where he'd
*06:24.900- 06:30.780* :  been discussing deploying Kenyan police in Haiti. Harold Isaac is a journalist in Porto Prince.
*06:31.340- 06:38.600* :  So last night there was a major attack against the biggest prison in Haiti where nearly 3,700
*06:38.600- 06:47.220* :  inmates are housed and roughly the majority of them have left. And who stormed the jail?
*06:47.460- 06:53.000* :  So it was a coordinated attack perpetrated by the gangs. They had announced it in the last few
*06:53.000- 07:01.080* :  days and they had been attacking the jail for the last 3 days prior to that and they eventually
*07:01.080- 07:06.500* :  succeeded. And have there been any injuries or fatalities? So as per the first reports at least
*07:06.500- 07:12.580* :  3 people died in front of the jail it's unclear whether it was guards or inmates. But as of this
*07:12.580- 07:17.160* :  morning that was the initial tally. So what are the police saying now in Haiti? So no official
*07:17.160- 07:23.020* :  words from the police at this point. However the police unions had called for help last night
*07:23.020- 07:30.480* :  on social media asking for any police officers that are available and have weapons and cars to
*07:30.480- 07:35.920* :  come to the main prison to help with the situation. But is it fair to say that
*07:35.920- 07:41.040* :  on top of everything else? This means that Porto Prince is absolutely lawless now.
*07:41.260- 07:46.500* :  Well the situation is very volatile. It's very fragile. We don't know what to expect from the
*07:46.500- 07:51.380* :  coming hours and days and everybody's waiting from a word from the authorities. At this point
*07:51.380- 07:57.120* :  the Prime Minister as of this morning still abroad coming back from his trip in Kenya.
*07:57.620- 08:02.540* :  And for the most part it seems that the gangs surge of violence this week is in reaction
*08:02.540- 08:08.600* :  to that visit to Kenya. Now that disagreement has been signed formally with the Kenyan authorities
*08:08.600- 08:15.580* :  it's unclear when the Kenyan police officers will arrive and also how the gangs will you know
*08:15.580- 08:19.520* :  react for the rest of the week. And Harold tell us a little bit about these gangs. They sound
*08:19.520- 08:26.340* :  extremely violent, well coordinated. It sounds a lot of planning goes into it. What is their
*08:26.340- 08:31.940* :  relationship with each other? So as of this week one of the most notorious gang leaders here in
*08:31.940- 08:38.580* :  Haiti, Barbecue had called for the union of all the gangs against the government to topple
*08:38.580- 08:44.680* :  the Prime Minister Ariel Honoree and essentially calling this new coalition living together
*08:45.320- 08:51.880* :  and claiming that they would wage a revolution. So since this announcement there's been
*08:51.880- 08:58.820* :  waves and waves of violence sweeping through the city and that ultimately resulted in that
*08:58.820- 09:06.020* :  jailbreak. Harold Isaac in Porto Prince. Over the weekend hundreds of Russians have visited the grave
*09:06.020- 09:12.360* :  of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Moscow. He was President Putin's fiercest critic and died
*09:12.360- 09:19.660* :  last month in an Arctic penal colony. The authorities say he died of natural causes but Mr. Navalny's
*09:19.660- 09:25.960* :  widow Yulia and his political allies say Vladimir Putin ordered his killing. One of those
*09:25.960- 09:32.000* :  watching the funeral from afar was Nathan Sharansky, a Soviet-era political dissident who spent
*09:32.000- 09:39.080* :  nine years in prison for high treason and espionage before his release back in 1986 and subsequent
*09:39.080- 09:45.000* :  immigration to Israel. About a year ago Mr. Sharansky received a letter from Mr. Navalny
*09:45.000- 09:50.340* :  who was in a punishment cell at the time. Gillian Marshall asked what the letter said.
*09:50.900- 09:58.740* :  It started a lot. I am writing to you as the reader to the author. I just read your book
*09:59.300- 10:07.060* :  and it reminds me exactly my situation. That was like the beginning of our conversation and then
*10:07.060- 10:17.440* :  he said how sad it is that situation became exactly as it was 40 years ago and he gave me some
*10:17.440- 10:26.600* :  examples from my book and from his situation and he was writing that he does hope that next time
*10:26.600- 10:32.540* :  when they will have a opportunity to change things they will not permit so easily to go back
*10:32.540- 10:39.200* :  to this station and so I immediately answered and said it for me it is like to get
*10:39.920- 10:48.340* :  letter from my alma mater and that he probably is the most free person in the world just now and by
*10:48.340- 10:56.420* :  he is in a freedom which keeps in prison he influences millions and millions other people
*10:57.360- 11:04.260* :  giving them a message not to be afraid and to be free and I also joked that I had some kind of
*11:04.260- 11:09.700* :  a record in those days or the number of days in the punishing cell but judging from all
*11:10.520- 11:16.580* :  he will beat my records and I want that he will not. Well unfortunately it was a black human
*11:17.280- 11:23.820* :  he had beaten all my records and he didn't survive. And your prison conditions as I understand it
*11:23.820- 11:31.960* :  were very similar in this punishment cell or shizu I think for sure. And what were those
*11:32.960- 11:39.080* :  punishments cell is a very small very small room it's very cold and they take away all the warm
*11:39.080- 11:47.620* :  closes it is three cups of hot water and three pieces of bread a day nobody to talk to nothing
*11:47.620- 11:55.320* :  to write or read officially this punishment can be no more than 15 days but then when they want
*11:55.320- 12:01.720* :  to break political prisoner they add another 15 days and another 15 days when I was
*12:01.720- 12:09.860* :  100 days at a roll I fell unconscious so they took me for a few hours out treated a little bit
*12:09.860- 12:16.480* :  they took back and so now what I saw with the naval net he described it very vividly
*12:16.700- 12:22.160* :  in his letter they were using the same tactics with him you have to understand in the first year
*12:22.160- 12:31.700* :  he spent 127 days in punishment cell in three years just before he was killed he spent 300 days
*12:31.700- 12:38.140* :  in the punishment cell it's very very tough it's as if they already decided to kill him if not
*12:38.140- 12:43.320* :  by poisoning if not by beating but simply to kill him with keeping in the punishment cell
*12:43.940- 12:50.180* :  you don't know exactly how whatever it was the Putin has to be blamed for his death
*12:50.940- 12:57.700* :  you believe that western politicians should have done more about mr. naval net yes I have to say
*12:58.340- 13:04.180* :  in our days they didn't know much what's happening but you know that all the free world is fighting
*13:04.180- 13:09.120* :  for you and that the leaders of the world you hope you expect are supporting this struggle
*13:09.540- 13:15.840* :  and later when you could speak to this politician now we can read the archives or white
*13:15.840- 13:22.080* :  houses other places you can see how practically on every negotiation with Soviet Union
*13:22.760- 13:29.060* :  the question of human rights the question of the fate of famous dissidents like Andrei Sakharo
*13:29.060- 13:35.340* :  Yuri alone I said was that is how it was raised and pressure on the Soviet Union was organized
*13:35.340- 13:42.220* :  there was direct linkage between the fate of leading political prisoners and other issues which
*13:42.220- 13:47.680* :  were of interest to the Soviet Union and I don't think it exists today at all
*13:48.240- 13:54.640* :  Nathan Sharansky scientists believe they've solved a mystery about star dunes the massive sand dunes
*13:54.640- 13:59.640* :  that look like stars when viewed from above they found in many deserts around the world
*13:59.640- 14:06.560* :  in Namibia in the Sahara in China and in the Mahavi in the United States but as Georgina
*14:06.560- 14:12.400* :  Ranoid reports until now there was no way of establishing exactly how old they are
*14:12.640- 14:18.500* :  star dunes are one of earth's most spectacular natural features also called pyramid dunes they
*14:18.500- 14:23.380* :  are named after the radiating arms formed by opposing winds blowing on the grains of sand
*14:24.240- 14:28.860* :  they make up almost 10% of the world's dunes and can be hundreds of meters high
*14:29.760- 14:34.780* :  experts had long been confused about why star dunes hadn't been found when looking at the layers
*14:34.780- 14:40.960* :  of rock that make up the earth's geological history but now a star dune called Lalla Lalla in Morocco
*14:40.960- 14:48.080* :  has been traced back 13,000 years this knowledge can help scientists better understand the climate of
*14:48.080- 14:54.220* :  the era professor Jeff Dull at the University of Aberystis explains how they made the discovery
*14:54.740- 14:59.860* :  we use a technique called luminescence dating which enables us to work out the last time those
*14:59.860- 15:06.220* :  sands were exposed to daylight because that tells us when the the dune formed so to do that we have
*15:06.220- 15:12.200* :  to collect them in the dark and then bring them back and process them under dim red light
*15:12.200- 15:18.100* :  conditions a bit like an old-fashioned photographic laboratory it's almost as if the mineral grains are
*15:18.100- 15:25.460* :  little rechargeable batteries they can store energy within the crystals and that energy comes from
*15:25.460- 15:31.600* :  radioactivity in the natural environment the longer they're buried in the ground the more of that
*15:31.600- 15:37.660* :  radioactivity they're exposed to and the energy builds up we can then get them to release that energy
*15:38.560- 15:43.300* :  and they release the energy and it comes out in the form of light so actually in our dark
*15:43.300- 15:49.080* :  laboratory we see light from these sand grains and the brighter the light then the older the sediment
*15:49.080- 15:57.400* :  grains the longer it is since they've been buried professor Jeff Duller still to come
*15:57.400- 16:04.320* :  Malaysia's transport minister promises to restart the search for the missing jetliner MH370
*16:04.320- 16:11.520* :  which disappeared a decade ago relatives of the missing react it's what we wanted to hear and we
*16:11.520- 16:17.500* :  hoped for that for a very long time the truth that's all we want until we're longing for that day

*17:32.240- 17:35.920* :  audio books and start listening weeks after a controversial election in Pakistan produced no
*17:35.920- 17:41.780* :  outright winner MPs have voted for the former prime minister shevaz Sharif to return to power
*17:42.000- 17:48.460* :  he secured 201 votes defeating his rival Omar Ayyab Khan who was supported by the jailed
*17:56.940- 18:04.040* :  former prime minister Imran Khan but the result was greeted by loud protest from lawmakers who
*18:10.360- 18:17.060* :  support Imran Khan. I request Mia Mohamed Shabar Sharif to take the seat of the prime minister
*18:17.060- 18:24.640* :  of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Despite that spattering of applause the jeering persisted
*18:24.640- 18:30.140* :  for some time the anger stems from the disputed election three weeks ago in which supporters
*18:30.140- 18:36.720* :  of Imran Khan's PTI party won the most seats but were forced to run as independence and were
*18:36.720- 18:42.420* :  enabled to form a government. Oliver Conway spoke to our correspondent Sahab Balak who was inside
*18:42.420- 18:47.480* :  the parliament building in Islamabad as the new prime minister was picked. The voting basically
*18:47.480- 18:53.180* :  started an hour later and as soon as it started the opposition benches especially by Imran Khan's
*18:53.180- 18:57.380* :  party they were the ones who created quite a stir they created quite a stir within the parliament
*18:57.380- 19:02.440* :  by their protests and everything their allegations of fraud and rigging in recent elections.
*19:02.440- 19:07.320* :  So there was a lot of commotion that we heard within the parliament as well so as soon as the
*19:07.320- 19:14.640* :  speaker announced that Shabar Sharif has taken 201 votes and his opponent Omar Ayyab has only
*19:14.640- 19:19.160* :  gotten 92 votes there was another uproar and people were like literally booing the fact that
*19:19.160- 19:24.200* :  Shabar Sharif has once again been elected. So it was basically the problems were basically starting
*19:24.300- 19:28.820* :  from the opposition benches as well so just a bit of a background about why the opposition benches
*19:28.820- 19:33.920* :  were doing so it's because Imran Khan has been alleging from inside the prison that this election
*19:33.920- 19:38.700* :  mandate was completely rigged that's his accusation against the government. He anyway has to
*19:38.700- 19:44.720* :  pick a bone with the Nawaz Sharif led government or now the Shahbaz Sharif led coalition only because
*19:44.720- 19:50.200* :  he says that you know this was all a part of the larger conspiracy against Imran Khan's election
*19:50.200- 19:55.260* :  in Pakistan against his government in 2022 as a result of which he was ousted from the parliament.
*19:55.260- 19:59.600* :  So since then there is like you know this karmish between the two like you know a lot of verbal
*19:59.600- 20:03.360* :  allegations against each other that they have been leveling for a while now.
*20:03.560- 20:08.000* :  And take us through the challenges facing this new government and how difficult
*20:08.780- 20:14.320* :  it will be to govern given the strong sense of feeling among those who support Imran Khan.
*20:14.580- 20:18.560* :  One of the biggest challenges that this government will have to face according to a lot of analysts
*20:18.560- 20:23.640* :  and even political parties that I have spoken to a lot of legislators told me that how they fear that
*20:23.640- 20:28.300* :  you know economic challenges and political challenges will have to be faced one way or the other but
*20:28.300- 20:32.560* :  for that every political party will have to sit together in Pakistan and they can no longer
*20:32.560- 20:37.160* :  play that card that they have been victimized or they have been this or that because in this case
*20:37.160- 20:41.460* :  the larger question of the sovereignty of the country and the fact that these challenges are
*20:41.460- 20:46.440* :  faced by Pakistan for a while now especially the economic challenges but many of them say that how
*20:46.440- 20:52.280* :  economic challenges cannot be fulfilled unless and until there are political challenges you know
*20:52.280- 20:58.500* :  that are sorted out between the political parties as well Sahab ala. It is 10 years since the
*20:58.500- 21:06.380* :  Malaysian airliner MH370 vanished from the skies with 239 people on board but now a new search
*21:06.380- 21:12.440* :  for the plane could soon take place. Anthony Lock Malaysia's transport minister said a proposal
*21:12.440- 21:19.240* :  from the robotics firm Ocean Infinity to scan the ocean floor is being reviewed. He was speaking
*21:19.240- 21:24.280* :  to reporters at a memorial event in Kuala Lumpur for the passengers and crew on the plane.
*21:24.860- 21:30.040* :  As I've mentioned numerous times as far as Malaysian is government is concerned we are committed
*21:30.620- 21:35.540* :  to that search and the search must go on and I'm very very confident that the government of Malaysia
*21:35.540- 21:42.240* :  and the cabinet will approve such proposal. Aurasia Pacific regional editor Celia Hatton told me more.
*21:42.800- 21:50.620* :  Malaysia has been under pressure to agree to a new search for more than a year now really the US
*21:50.620- 21:58.460* :  based firm Ocean Infinity which conducted a search for Malaysia back in 2018 for three months
*21:58.460- 22:03.720* :  they didn't come up with anything and then the search was called off but for the past few years
*22:04.380- 22:10.180* :  researchers who've been studying debris that's believed to come from the plane some of it has
*22:10.180- 22:16.040* :  been confirmed it's washed up on the coast of Africa other bits that are believed to be from
*22:16.040- 22:21.120* :  the plane that have washed up on islands in the Indian Ocean researchers that have been studying
*22:21.120- 22:26.740* :  those say they now really believe they know where the plane could be located. Ocean Infinity has
*22:26.740- 22:31.420* :  been saying for quite some time that they're more than willing to enter into another search and so
*22:31.420- 22:36.900* :  it's the Malaysians that have been under pressure they've been holding off on signing a contract
*22:36.900- 22:43.020* :  with Ocean Infinity until they said that there was credible new evidence relatives really want
*22:43.020- 22:50.020* :  the search to continue while some answers can be found we heard from some relatives today at the
*22:50.020- 22:55.600* :  memorial in Kuala Lumpur let's listen to some of them now. It's what we wanted to hear and we
*22:55.600- 23:02.440* :  hoped for that for a very long time so I'm so thankful. One thing that'll be someone will come
*23:03.100- 23:09.940* :  forward and tell us what really going on the truth that's all we want until we're longing for that
*23:09.940- 23:15.880* :  yeah until the day. And Celia if a contract is signed with Ocean Infinity what with the details
*23:15.880- 23:23.660* :  do we know? It's believed to be a no cure no fee contract meaning if Ocean Infinity doesn't find
*23:23.660- 23:30.200* :  the plane they don't get paid back in 2018 the promise was that they would be paid 70 million
*23:30.200- 23:35.460* :  if they found the plane we think it'll be around the same kind of contract this time.
*23:35.620- 23:40.720* :  And Celia this saga has been going on hasn't it for nearly a decade and you have been covering it
*23:41.020- 23:46.800* :  from the beginning. Yeah that's right I was one of the BBC's China correspondents living and working
*23:46.800- 23:53.580* :  in Beijing when news first came that the plane had disappeared you have to remember the plane was
*23:53.580- 24:00.180* :  on route to China when it disappeared it was about an hour into an overnight flight when it veered
*24:00.180- 24:08.340* :  off course many of the passengers it was carrying were Chinese 150 out of the 239 people on board
*24:08.340- 24:14.680* :  were from China so instantly we got news that many of the relatives were gathering at an airport
*24:14.680- 24:21.160* :  hotel that's where Malaysia Airlines had told them to gather for news of where the plane could be
*24:21.620- 24:28.000* :  and so every day for almost two weeks we would go to that airport hotel and meet with relatives
*24:28.000- 24:34.060* :  speak to them and also try to get information from Malaysian Airlines it was a heartbreaking time
*24:34.180- 24:40.560* :  because every day the search became more grim it became more and more apparent that the plane had
*24:40.560- 24:47.380* :  really disappeared and those images will really never leave my mind of relatives who at first
*24:48.080- 24:53.220* :  were hopeful that the plane would be found and slowly the crowds who came to the airport hotel
*24:53.220- 24:57.300* :  every day became smaller because hope really began to dwindle.
*24:57.860- 25:01.540* :  Syria Hatton Europe has been negligent as accepting
*25:01.540- 25:06.440* :  cocaine and cannabis use leads to corruption and violence well that's according to the
*25:06.440- 25:12.260* :  mayor of the Dutch city of Rotterdam Ahmed Abu Talep who says a lack's attitude to recreational
*25:12.260- 25:18.820* :  drug use including by the middle classes has led to corruption and brutality in deprived neighborhoods
*25:19.500- 25:25.400* :  Ahmed Abu Talep began by telling Paul Henley about the teenagers getting caught up in the drug trade
*25:25.400- 25:30.660* :  as couriers for the cocaine shipments arriving in Rotterdam from South America.
*25:31.220- 25:37.940* :  We call them the front soldiers as they have to remove cocaine from containers in the port
*25:37.940- 25:47.820* :  and these youngsters sometimes can get up to $10,000, $20, $30, $150,000 if you succeed in
*25:48.360- 25:54.020* :  selling pinco that is needed to get access to certain areas that is the big problem
*25:54.520- 26:01.360* :  that's poisoning the neighborhood's economy and it's working negative in terms of motivating kids
*26:01.360- 26:07.240* :  to stay at school. How dangerous is it potentially to speak out the way you are doing?
*26:07.800- 26:14.220* :  We know that people connected to high-profile trials have been murdered in previous cases don't we?
*26:14.660- 26:21.820* :  I'm not working on individual cases. I'm pleading for general policy development to deal with this
*26:21.820- 26:29.460* :  issue. I'm never involved in debating individual cases in courts or in newspapers. I stay away from
*26:29.460- 26:34.940* :  that. What would you like to see change at a grassroots level? Would police persistently
*26:34.940- 26:38.920* :  prosecuting middle-class drug users change things really?
*26:39.280- 26:43.540* :  Well, we're not only prosecuting poor people working for little money in neighborhoods
*26:43.580- 26:50.280* :  to be front-soldiers. We also prosecute big names in the Netherlands. What I need is that
*26:50.280- 26:56.680* :  government in Europe is totally condemned use of cocaine and also try to explain that this is
*26:56.680- 27:03.160* :  dangerous and be aware that the combination of cocaine with the upcoming synthetic drug
*27:03.220- 27:10.140* :  fentanyl is killing people. So we'll probably go back to the 70s and 80s when on the streets of
*27:10.140- 27:16.320* :  Europe we found people dying from the use of heroin. So I'm really afraid if we accept
*27:16.460- 27:22.160* :  and more use of cocaine as a normal thing that will be a big problem in the future.
*27:22.460- 27:27.420* :  There is an alternative approach, isn't there? From some interested in combating organized crime,
*27:27.420- 27:32.440* :  the mayor of Amsterdam, for instance, has said the sale of cocaine and other drug should be
*27:32.440- 27:36.960* :  decriminalized and regulated in order to squeeze out the criminals.
*27:36.960- 27:42.220* :  Regulated means you need to regulate. But don't forget that this organized crime organization,
*27:42.880- 27:48.420* :  this is a way of living for them. If we take them this source of income, they will move to another
*27:48.420- 27:55.020* :  source of income. Weapons, human trafficking, these people don't get to be tired by working,
*27:55.020- 27:58.960* :  they want to get the money while they are in the swimming pool somewhere in a warm country.
*27:59.600- 28:03.240* :  This will not help to bring crime down in our societies.
*28:03.620- 28:09.140* :  What works better to stop a banker at a party taking cocaine on a Saturday night? An
*28:09.140- 28:15.200* :  information campaign saying how many lives are being ruined or a genuine threat of arrest and
*28:15.200- 28:21.120* :  prosecution in prison? I think both. And I'm not naive. Using drugs exists in societies since
*28:21.120- 28:26.560* :  the existence of humanity on earth. So it will never be zero. Well, what I want is to contain it,
*28:26.560- 28:31.600* :  to bring it back to an acceptable level that law enforcement agencies can deal with it.
*28:32.120- 28:37.440* :  Forty-thousand people in Rotterdam are using cocaine and colonized. That's too big.
*28:37.440- 28:42.600* :  I want to bring it back to acceptable numbers and what is acceptable that is for society to be
*28:42.600- 28:49.660* :  debated. I'm Ed, a butteleb, the mayor of Rotterdam. And let's return to our main story,
*28:49.660- 28:55.760* :  the war between Israel and Hamas. It's stirring up tensions in countries thousands of kilometers
*28:55.760- 29:02.060* :  away and affecting events worlds away from a military conflict. Now Israel has agreed to revise
*29:02.060- 29:07.620* :  the lyrics of its entry to the Eurovision Song Contest, after organizers took issue with
*29:07.620- 29:13.360* :  verses that appeared to refer to the attack by Hamas on October 7th. The rules of Eurovision
*29:13.360- 29:19.500* :  ban content that could be considered political, as Elepino reports. Eurovision's organizer,
*29:19.500- 29:25.520* :  the European Broadcasting Union, prides itself on pushing on a non-political events. However,
*29:25.520- 29:31.580* :  Israel's participation is proving controversial this year. Musicians across Europe have written
*29:31.580- 29:37.600* :  letters calling for Israel to be suspended. It's partly due to opposition to Israel itself because
*29:37.600- 29:42.260* :  of the war in Gaza. But also because it's alleged that the lyrics in its entry,
*29:42.260- 29:47.980* :  called October Rain, made political references to the Hamas attacks at an outdoor music festival
*29:47.980- 29:54.220* :  on October 7th last year, which sparked the war. Israel's entrance is 20-year-old Eden Galan,
*29:54.500- 29:59.520* :  who won a public vote in a national tournament show, singing hits from the likes of Whitney Houston
*30:06.880- 30:13.860* :  and Aerosmith. But the lyrics in October Rain were said to include lines such as
*30:13.860- 30:18.560* :  there's no air left to breathe and there were all good children, each one of them.
*30:18.560- 30:24.020* :  It's also reported that the song included the word flowers, a term that Israeli defence forces
*30:24.020- 30:29.420* :  allegedly used to mean fallen soldiers. Israel originally stated it would withdraw from the
*30:29.420- 30:34.600* :  competition if there were any attempts to censor its entry. However, following a request from
*30:34.600- 30:39.520* :  the president Isaac Herzog, the national broadcaster now says it's agreed to make changes.
*30:40.160- 30:45.220* :  It says it's asked the song's writers to revise their lyrics while also preserving their artistic
*30:45.220- 30:50.900* :  freedom. This year's contest takes place in the Swedish city of Marmo, in early May.
*30:51.420- 30:54.660* :  But the sign being, we expect to see Israel among the acts.
