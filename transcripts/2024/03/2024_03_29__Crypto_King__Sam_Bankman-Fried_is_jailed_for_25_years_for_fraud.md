*00:24.020- 00:27.420* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:30.100- 00:33.780* :  I'm Rachel Wright and in the early hours of Friday the 29th of March,
*00:33.780- 00:35.320* :  these are our main stories.
*00:35.760- 00:39.220* :  The former cryptocurrency billionaire, Sam Bankman Freed,
*00:39.220- 00:44.720* :  has been sentenced to 25 years in jail for one of the biggest financial frauds in US history.
*00:45.340- 00:49.280* :  The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to take urgent action
*00:49.280- 00:52.800* :  to ensure basic food supplies to Palestinians in Gaza,
*00:53.240- 00:54.900* :  saying starvation is spreading.
*00:55.640- 00:59.120* :  Doctors have reported a sharp increase in cases of dengue fever
*00:59.120- 01:02.220* :  in the Americas, which could be linked to global warming.
*01:05.540- 01:06.900* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:07.520- 01:10.420* :  The bill states that it's against the law to discriminate
*01:10.420- 01:15.280* :  on the basis of the cut, length, colour or texture of a person's hair.
*01:15.740- 01:18.960* :  The French lower house of Parliament begins the legal process
*01:18.960- 01:22.440* :  to protect against such prejudicial practices in the workplace.
*01:28.040- 01:31.900* :  Where ever the Wonder Kins Sam Bankman Freed goes, the circus follows.
*01:32.320- 01:33.880* :  Thursday was no exception.
*01:34.440- 01:38.060* :  As the world's media gathered outside a court in Manhattan in New York,
*01:38.060- 01:42.260* :  the former crypto king arrived with his trademark bushy black hair,
*01:42.660- 01:45.860* :  but wearing prison clothes supplied by a detention centre.
*01:45.860- 01:50.280* :  He's been held there since August last year when a judge revoked his bail
*01:50.280- 01:53.500* :  because of what he called likely tampering with witnesses.
*01:54.340- 01:57.680* :  But with a sentence of 25 years for stealing $8 billion
*01:57.980- 02:02.560* :  from the customers of the now bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange,
*02:02.580- 02:06.960* :  it may be Sam Bankman Freed's last appearance in public for some time.
*02:07.520- 02:10.920* :  His parents, who are both professors of law, were outside court
*02:11.340- 02:13.660* :  doing their best not to talk to journalists.
*02:13.860- 02:17.080* :  OK, we'll use bad death in the weather for a while.
*02:17.080- 02:19.520* :  Did you ever think this would happen to your son, your attorney?
*02:19.520- 02:21.100* :  What is your legal advice?
*02:21.100- 02:22.280* :  I'm going to turn here on you.
*02:23.280- 02:23.940* :  I'm not making.
*02:24.220- 02:24.820* :  I'm not.
*02:25.340- 02:27.400* :  How are you feeling today?
*02:27.400- 02:28.660* :  How are you feeling today?
*02:29.720- 02:32.240* :  No answer to that or any of the other questions.
*02:32.340- 02:35.980* :  I spoke to our New York business correspondent, Michelle Fleury,
*02:36.300- 02:39.280* :  and asked her for more about the sentence that was handed out.
*02:39.880- 02:43.460* :  The prosecutors had been asking for as much as 40 to 50 years
*02:43.460- 02:48.460* :  and sentenced guidelines were such that it could have been as much as 110 years.
*02:48.960- 02:53.120* :  I think what the judge, Lewis Kaplan, was taking into account here,
*02:53.460- 02:54.680* :  was three factors.
*02:55.160- 02:57.880* :  One, his age, his 32,
*02:58.500- 03:00.300* :  secondly, the losses involved,
*03:00.880- 03:03.400* :  and thirdly, the idea of deterrence.
*03:03.400- 03:06.220* :  What message are you sending to stop others
*03:06.220- 03:08.720* :  from committing similar crimes going forward?
*03:09.520- 03:15.120* :  And speaking to lawyers who specialize and focus on white collar crime,
*03:15.120- 03:16.780* :  speaking to former prosecutors,
*03:17.600- 03:19.560* :  speaking even to one of the lead prosecutors
*03:19.560- 03:22.800* :  who brought the case against the disgraced financier Bernie Madoff,
*03:23.320- 03:26.680* :  there is a sort of sense that he kind of hit the right balance
*03:26.780- 03:28.320* :  between these three things.
*03:28.320- 03:32.840* :  The idea is that if he serves the full sentence of 25 years,
*03:32.840- 03:35.600* :  he will emerge as a 50-something-year-old.
*03:35.980- 03:37.940* :  And the idea that this kind of wonderkin,
*03:37.940- 03:40.900* :  who the judge said seemed to express little remorse,
*03:41.240- 03:43.220* :  the chances are that by his 50s,
*03:43.220- 03:46.800* :  he sort of won't be perhaps so persuasive or may have changed by then.
*03:47.340- 03:49.880* :  Yeah, you mentioned that Sam Bankman-Freed
*03:50.380- 03:51.580* :  didn't have much remorse,
*03:51.780- 03:53.540* :  but he did apologise to his convictions.
*03:53.540- 03:54.820* :  Was that enough for the judge?
*03:55.200- 03:57.740* :  Well, he also said that he thought the most useful part
*03:57.740- 03:59.320* :  of his life was over,
*03:59.900- 04:02.300* :  and he said that he had made bad decisions.
*04:02.900- 04:04.640* :  There was also Mark McCasey,
*04:04.640- 04:06.840* :  who's the defense attorney for Bankman-Freed.
*04:07.120- 04:11.500* :  He tried to sort of paint him as a sensitive, good-hearted person
*04:11.500- 04:13.300* :  as something of an awkward mat nerd.
*04:14.060- 04:14.680* :  But here's the thing,
*04:14.680- 04:17.220* :  none of that seemed to hold sway with the judge,
*04:17.220- 04:18.940* :  who basically took into account
*04:19.380- 04:21.000* :  what Mr. Bankman-Freed was saying,
*04:21.000- 04:22.580* :  took into account his autism,
*04:23.120- 04:24.760* :  the fact that he socially awkward,
*04:25.380- 04:28.320* :  but he still said that he committed a very serious crime,
*04:28.320- 04:29.900* :  and he kept going back again and again
*04:29.900- 04:32.060* :  to testimony from Caroline Ellison.
*04:32.500- 04:35.120* :  Now, she was the head of Alameda Research,
*04:35.340- 04:36.120* :  the hedge fund,
*04:36.460- 04:37.580* :  where some of the money was taken
*04:37.580- 04:40.300* :  from the FTX crypto-trading platform
*04:40.300- 04:43.140* :  and kind of siphoned off into the hedge fund.
*04:43.480- 04:47.100* :  She was also the former girlfriend of Mr. Bankman-Freed,
*04:47.100- 04:48.120* :  and it was her testimony,
*04:48.140- 04:49.820* :  it seems, in hindsight,
*04:50.100- 04:52.540* :  that kind of held sway with the judge,
*04:52.680- 04:55.080* :  who kind of said that based on that,
*04:55.080- 04:57.520* :  he felt Mr. Bankman-Freed was evasive,
*04:58.020- 04:59.400* :  that he was splitting hairs
*04:59.400- 05:01.000* :  while lying about his conduct.
*05:01.580- 05:02.900* :  And so here we are,
*05:03.260- 05:05.040* :  this 25-year sentence,
*05:05.100- 05:06.960* :  not to forget also,
*05:07.320- 05:08.860* :  he's got a four-fit $11 billion,
*05:09.720- 05:11.460* :  and that's to compensate victims.
*05:11.460- 05:13.920* :  I think the judge was trying to say,
*05:14.280- 05:16.280* :  you know, this should not happen again.
*05:16.900- 05:18.460* :  Michelle Flurry in New York,
*05:19.020- 05:20.860* :  just before the sentence was handed out,
*05:20.860- 05:23.300* :  Sam Fenix, spoke to Samuel Haypack,
*05:23.740- 05:24.960* :  CEO of Wincent,
*05:25.020- 05:27.940* :  a company on the crypto exchange FTX.
*05:28.520- 05:30.340* :  We just had our money on the exchange.
*05:30.460- 05:33.260* :  We lost 35 million US dollars.
*05:33.720- 05:35.020* :  35 million.
*05:35.300- 05:35.560* :  Yes.
*05:36.240- 05:37.640* :  Wow, that's a lot to lose.
*05:38.260- 05:39.220* :  That's a lot to lose.
*05:39.740- 05:40.760* :  How do you feel about
*05:40.920- 05:42.640* :  what's being played out in court now?
*05:42.900- 05:46.620* :  Well, I think it's very important for the future
*05:47.200- 05:49.380* :  to reduce the amount of fraud
*05:49.380- 05:51.100* :  that's happening around crypto.
*05:51.820- 05:54.440* :  And I believe that the way to do that
*05:54.440- 05:57.300* :  is to show that fraudsters are going to be punished.
*05:57.560- 06:00.660* :  You were a customer, as you say,
*06:01.620- 06:03.360* :  investing other people's cash.
*06:04.080- 06:06.060* :  Tell us the moment that you had to tell them
*06:06.240- 06:08.860* :  your customers that you lost this 35 million.
*06:09.140- 06:12.760* :  It was a very, very bad moment.
*06:12.760- 06:16.580* :  We did a conference call with all of our investors.
*06:16.580- 06:18.320* :  There were 200 of them.
*06:18.720- 06:21.000* :  And we had to explain to them
*06:21.480- 06:24.320* :  that we lost 35 million of their money,
*06:24.820- 06:26.600* :  which was substantial percentage
*06:26.600- 06:29.680* :  of what every one of them invested.
*06:30.520- 06:32.920* :  Now, naturally, they were upset.
*06:32.920- 06:34.100* :  They were angry.
*06:34.680- 06:37.460* :  They considered us utterly incompetent
*06:37.460- 06:40.540* :  that we were able to trust such a fraudster
*06:41.100- 06:43.860* :  that we didn't see this coming sooner, et cetera.
*06:44.520- 06:45.480* :  As a result of that,
*06:46.360- 06:49.540* :  we lost 25% of those investors.
*06:49.540- 06:52.880* :  They decided they don't trust us anymore.
*06:52.880- 06:55.080* :  They don't trust our judgment anymore.
*06:55.700- 06:59.180* :  They took the remaining money that they had with us away.
*06:59.900- 07:03.800* :  And essentially, this led to us losing
*07:03.800- 07:06.520* :  half of our capital at all.
*07:06.880- 07:12.000* :  So whilst you've lost 35 million in the FTX situation,
*07:12.180- 07:13.840* :  you've actually lost a lot more.
*07:14.360- 07:16.620* :  Yes, we lost double that, essentially.
*07:17.520- 07:18.380* :  Samuel Haypack.
*07:19.340- 07:23.060* :  Israel has been ordered to allow urgent humanitarian assistance
*07:23.060- 07:26.180* :  in Gaza by judges at the International Court of Justice
*07:26.420- 07:26.980* :  in the Hague.
*07:27.360- 07:30.180* :  The court said famine and starvation are spreading
*07:30.180- 07:32.220* :  and Israel must take effective action
*07:32.220- 07:34.500* :  to ensure basic food supplies arrive
*07:34.500- 07:38.000* :  without delay for the Palestinian population in Gaza.
*07:38.580- 07:40.720* :  The measures were requested by South Africa
*07:40.720- 07:43.080* :  as part of its case that accuses Israel
*07:43.080- 07:45.280* :  of state-led genocide in Gaza.
*07:45.880- 07:48.080* :  The United Nations has warned that the health system
*07:48.080- 07:49.380* :  in Gaza is collapsing.
*07:49.380- 07:52.180* :  It's also said it's warnings about famine
*07:52.180- 07:54.940* :  in the North are ever closer to becoming a reality
*07:54.940- 07:57.880* :  and water is becoming increasingly scarce.
*07:58.420- 08:01.920* :  James Elder from the UN Children's Charity UNICEF
*08:02.140- 08:05.400* :  said people in Gaza were living in fear for their lives.
*08:06.100- 08:08.480* :  They are so exhausted by this nightmare
*08:08.480- 08:10.540* :  that they've said that they want it to be over
*08:10.580- 08:12.000* :  and they want to be hit by a bomb.
*08:12.000- 08:14.820* :  And the horrendous reality is that you hear things
*08:14.820- 08:16.900* :  hear all the time that it shouldn't normally hear
*08:16.900- 08:19.260* :  and whether it's that or whether it's talking to a child
*08:19.260- 08:20.840* :  who's lost their entire family.
*08:21.300- 08:23.900* :  And yes, when the bombardments are intense as they often are,
*08:24.280- 08:25.980* :  when you lie in bed because there's no protection,
*08:26.080- 08:27.260* :  so you lie there just waiting.
*08:27.780- 08:29.420* :  And if it does feel like a coffin
*08:29.420- 08:30.640* :  and you think of those children
*08:31.100- 08:32.840* :  who've done that every single night
*08:32.840- 08:33.920* :  for five and a half months.
*08:34.700- 08:36.700* :  Our correspondent Hugo Bicega
*08:36.700- 08:38.700* :  is following developments from Jerusalem.
*08:39.320- 08:41.000* :  Well, I think this shows that patience
*08:41.000- 08:44.480* :  is running very low international patience with Israel
*08:45.140- 08:47.820* :  given the humanitarian situation in Gaza
*08:48.320- 08:53.740* :  and this decision by the ICJ now urging Israel to take
*08:54.200- 08:56.460* :  all the necessary measures to ensure
*08:56.460- 08:58.940* :  that basic supplies arrive without delay
*08:58.940- 09:00.920* :  to the Palestinian population in Gaza.
*09:01.600- 09:03.880* :  What we're seeing here is that aid organizations
*09:03.880- 09:08.920* :  are accusing Israel of deliberately creating obstacles
*09:08.920- 09:10.780* :  to the delivery of aid,
*09:10.780- 09:12.320* :  something that the Israelis have denied.
*09:12.980- 09:16.620* :  They say that the problem is with the distribution
*09:16.760- 09:18.940* :  of aid inside Gaza,
*09:18.940- 09:20.260* :  they're blaming the United Nations,
*09:20.260- 09:23.240* :  they're blaming charities inside Gaza,
*09:23.240- 09:25.800* :  something that all these groups have rejected.
*09:26.320- 09:28.560* :  So I think pressure is growing on Israel
*09:29.120- 09:31.680* :  and I think this decision again shows,
*09:32.180- 09:35.220* :  you know, how the international community is,
*09:35.220- 09:37.580* :  you know, exasperated by the situation in Gaza.
*09:37.780- 09:39.480* :  It was quite striking, I think,
*09:39.480- 09:43.640* :  watching the head of UNICEF saying that people in Gaza
*09:43.640- 09:46.800* :  are, you know, but they think that people outside
*09:46.800- 09:49.860* :  don't know that they're so hungry, that they're starving.
*09:50.160- 09:53.400* :  Just days ago, I was in Rafa on the Egyptian side
*09:53.400- 09:54.360* :  of the Gaza border
*09:54.940- 09:59.260* :  and UN officials told me that 1500 trucks are waiting
*09:59.940- 10:02.080* :  to cross the border to be allowed
*10:02.080- 10:04.560* :  by Israeli authorities to cross the border.
*10:05.040- 10:07.900* :  So you have this situation that there is,
*10:07.900- 10:10.700* :  you know, the aid waiting to, you know,
*10:10.700- 10:14.340* :  be allowed in Gaza and just kilometers away
*10:14.340- 10:15.460* :  on the other side of the border.
*10:16.060- 10:18.020* :  People, you know, going hungry,
*10:18.800- 10:20.760* :  some people dying because of hunger
*10:21.400- 10:24.220* :  and obviously, you know, concerns that famine may happen
*10:24.220- 10:26.960* :  especially in the north of the territory
*10:26.960- 10:28.480* :  if the situation doesn't change.
*10:28.660- 10:31.020* :  Meanwhile, there's an intensification of fighting
*10:31.020- 10:33.660* :  around the hospital in Khan Unis.
*10:33.880- 10:36.380* :  Exactly, and the Israeli military says
*10:36.840- 10:39.380* :  he has killed dozens of Hamas fighters
*10:39.500- 10:43.220* :  near Al-Ahmad hospital, which hasn't now been evacuated
*10:43.460- 10:47.320* :  and Israeli troops are also near the Nasser hospital
*10:47.320- 10:48.100* :  in the city.
*10:48.100- 10:52.280* :  So this is where Palestinians have been seeking shelter
*10:52.860- 10:55.340* :  and the Palestinian red crescent has raised concerns
*10:55.340- 10:56.740* :  about thousands of people.
*10:56.740- 10:59.880* :  It says a stuck in the hospital
*10:59.880- 11:04.180* :  and the United Nations again has warned that across Gaza,
*11:04.560- 11:07.020* :  the health system is collapsing because of the fighting
*11:07.480- 11:09.680* :  and with shortages of basic supplies,
*11:10.160- 11:12.120* :  many Palestinians are unlikely to survive.
*11:12.700- 11:14.600* :  Hugo Bachega in Jerusalem.
*11:15.660- 11:19.240* :  The United States and South Korea have reacted with fury
*11:19.240- 11:22.440* :  to Russia's decision to use its security council veto
*11:22.440- 11:25.620* :  to block the renewal of an expert panel
*11:25.620- 11:29.320* :  that monitors the enforcement of sanctions against North Korea.
*11:29.920- 11:32.680* :  A U.S. State Department spokesman accused Moscow
*11:32.680- 11:35.700* :  of undermining international peace and security
*11:35.700- 11:39.520* :  to advance the corrupt bargain it had struck with Biong Yang.
*11:40.180- 11:42.420* :  And the South Korean ambassador to the UN,
*11:42.420- 11:44.560* :  Juan Dune Cook, had this to say.
*11:45.160- 11:49.580* :  Russia employed an all-too-familiar and obvious tactic
*11:50.320- 11:53.280* :  by insisting on completely unacceptable conditions
*11:54.040- 11:55.840* :  without any room for compromise.
*11:56.600- 11:59.820* :  This is almost comparable to destroying a CCTV,
*12:01.180- 12:03.500* :  to avoid being caught red handed.
*12:04.220- 12:07.800* :  Our United Nations correspondent Netta Taufik has more details.
*12:08.820- 12:11.320* :  Until now, the security council had voted annually
*12:11.320- 12:14.200* :  over 14 years to renew the panel of experts.
*12:14.260- 12:17.660* :  They have monitored and investigated sanctions violations
*12:17.780- 12:21.100* :  and have reported back to the council with recommendations.
*12:22.060- 12:24.420* :  Russia's UN ambassador, Vaseline Abenzia,
*12:24.420- 12:27.280* :  said that the panel played into the hands of the West,
*12:27.280- 12:31.440* :  whose countries led by the U.S. were trying to strangle North Korea.
*12:32.120- 12:33.980* :  In a joint statement after the vote,
*12:33.980- 12:37.040* :  the U.S. Britain, France, Japan, and South Korea
*12:37.420- 12:40.120* :  said Russia's veto was nothing more than an attempt
*12:40.120- 12:43.380* :  to silence independent objective investigations
*12:43.460- 12:47.440* :  into persistent violations of the sanctions by North Korea
*12:47.880- 12:48.960* :  and Russia itself.
*12:49.640- 12:52.300* :  The country's accused Moscow of trying to block
*12:52.300- 12:55.860* :  the panel's investigation into Russia's alleged violations
*12:55.860- 12:56.780* :  of the sanctions.
*12:56.940- 13:00.020* :  It's believed to have secured arms from Pyongyang
*13:00.020- 13:01.640* :  for its war in Ukraine.
*13:02.400- 13:03.980* :  Netta Taufik in New York.
*13:04.880- 13:07.860* :  Next to India, the Prime Minister, Norendra Modi,
*13:07.860- 13:09.860* :  has been in power for two terms.
*13:10.400- 13:13.160* :  During that time, the country has experienced religious
*13:14.080- 13:16.260* :  polarization and widespread Islamophobia.
*13:16.820- 13:18.360* :  Ahead of the general election,
*13:18.460- 13:21.160* :  due to begin next month, which Mr Modi's Hindu
*13:21.160- 13:24.200* :  nationalist BJP party is expected to win,
*13:24.760- 13:26.520* :  people from the Muslim community,
*13:26.520- 13:28.800* :  who make up India's largest minority,
*13:28.800- 13:32.240* :  have told the BBC they feel they're being marginalised
*13:32.400- 13:33.060* :  and suppressed.
*13:33.600- 13:35.440* :  The government denies the allegations.
*13:35.540- 13:38.360* :  Yigitla Mai reports from Northern India.
*13:40.880- 13:42.760* :  I'm Adir Jepur Junction.
*13:42.760- 13:45.100* :  It's a bustling, busy railway station
*13:45.640- 13:46.800* :  in the northwest of India.
*13:47.560- 13:50.700* :  On the 30th of July, a train began its journey
*13:50.700- 13:52.720* :  from here on route to Mumbai.
*13:52.720- 13:54.820* :  But before it reached its destination,
*13:54.860- 13:58.540* :  a railway police constable shot dead four people.
*13:59.260- 14:00.380* :  One of them was this colleague,
*14:00.380- 14:03.460* :  but three others were Muslim civilians.
*14:04.360- 14:07.260* :  In a country where we have seen increasing violence
*14:07.260- 14:08.740* :  against the Muslim minority,
*14:08.740- 14:11.700* :  this is an incident that stands out.
*14:11.940- 14:14.220* :  Because the person who carried out the violence
*14:14.640- 14:18.120* :  took a pledge to protect all civilians of India.
*14:19.460- 14:20.960* :  A chilling mobile phone video
*14:20.960- 14:23.360* :  of the incident surfaced on social media,
*14:23.800- 14:25.040* :  showing the railway policeman
*14:25.040- 14:27.760* :  standing with his foot on the bloody body
*14:27.760- 14:28.980* :  of one of his victims.
*14:30.080- 14:32.080* :  Your masters are in Pakistan, we know.
*14:32.660- 14:34.340* :  But if you want to live in India,
*14:34.800- 14:36.260* :  vote for Prime Minister Modi.
*14:36.940- 14:38.000* :  He's heard same.
*14:38.980- 14:41.340* :  The railway policeman is being tried for murder,
*14:41.800- 14:43.440* :  but the incident has led to fear
*14:43.440- 14:44.560* :  within their community.
*14:44.560- 14:47.440* :  The victim's wife, Umessa Begum, says,
*14:50.200- 14:51.740* :  I believe my husband was killed
*14:51.780- 14:54.060* :  because he had appeared and wore a skull cap
*14:54.440- 14:55.760* :  and was visibly a Muslim.
*14:56.720- 14:59.500* :  And the man who killed him wasn't an ordinary man.
*14:59.580- 15:01.320* :  He was a railway policeman.
*15:02.020- 15:03.560* :  How can you trust the police now?
*15:04.160- 15:05.460* :  I want to tell the Prime Minister,
*15:05.460- 15:07.820* :  this is all because of your politics.
*15:08.720- 15:10.500* :  That's why such incidents are increasing.
*15:11.340- 15:12.460* :  When my children go out,
*15:12.800- 15:15.420* :  I worry about whether they'll come back safely or not.
*15:16.740- 15:18.260* :  The Minister for Minority Affairs
*15:18.260- 15:21.060* :  didn't reply to the BBC's questions about the issue,
*15:21.200- 15:25.560* :  but I'm now meeting Sayyad Zafar, Islam Muslim spokesman
*15:26.040- 15:27.520* :  from the Prime Minister's party
*15:27.520- 15:31.800* :  to ask him about the allegations of rising Islamophobia
*15:32.140- 15:33.520* :  under Mr Modi's government.
*15:34.000- 15:36.100* :  It is the opposition parties
*15:36.100- 15:38.460* :  who are using Muslim community as a shield.
*15:38.460- 15:39.620* :  They are feeling the hate.
*15:39.860- 15:42.640* :  Muslim community is absolutely comfortable.
*15:42.660- 15:43.620* :  They're happy.
*15:44.100- 15:45.480* :  But some people have told us this.
*15:45.480- 15:46.580* :  We have recorded this.
*15:46.920- 15:48.700* :  Ordinary people, not political parties.
*15:48.780- 15:52.520* :  Say, if one or two people say such thing,
*15:52.700- 15:54.700* :  it cannot be true for the entire community.
*15:57.000- 16:00.360* :  We've come to a Muslim-dominated locality in Delhi
*16:00.360- 16:02.820* :  to hear what ordinary people think.
*16:03.580- 16:06.860* :  Now, the major problem is insecurity in the community, right?
*16:07.240- 16:08.580* :  This is something which is very careful.
*16:08.580- 16:11.380* :  My close friend who used to visit my home
*16:11.440- 16:14.340* :  and nowadays, he's not coming because he gets to know
*16:14.340- 16:16.300* :  that he's a Muslim and you should not be going there.
*16:16.360- 16:18.980* :  The way, the experience of being a Muslim in India has changed
*16:18.980- 16:21.740* :  is that there is a very major sense of insecurity here.
*16:21.780- 16:23.940* :  For example, if you take your mic and you walk around here,
*16:23.940- 16:25.880* :  there won't be many people who would be looking to talk to you.
*16:26.120- 16:27.860* :  They don't want their name or face coming up
*16:27.860- 16:29.820* :  on TV and being targeted for whatever you think.
*16:30.260- 16:33.580* :  And indeed, it was extremely hard to get people to talk to us.
*16:33.580- 16:35.860* :  A lot of people didn't want to be recorded
*16:35.860- 16:37.140* :  out of fear of reprisal.
*16:38.040- 16:39.880* :  And that's something that's really new for me
*16:39.920- 16:42.600* :  in nearly 20 years of being a journalist in India.
*16:42.600- 16:45.420* :  I can't ever remember coming to a Muslim locality
*16:45.820- 16:49.120* :  and seeing this kind of fear and apprehension on the ground.
*16:49.120- 16:52.500* :  The extent of religious polarization deeper
*16:52.900- 16:54.580* :  than I've ever experienced before.
*16:56.840- 16:57.800* :  Yogi Salamai.
*17:00.720- 17:01.460* :  Still to come.
*17:01.800- 17:06.100* :  I'm perfect example of a non-stereotypical lifeguard.
*17:06.440- 17:10.460* :  I'm now 74, so I can't imagine any of the lifeguards
*17:10.460- 17:13.500* :  on Baywatch being more than 20-somethings.
*17:13.660- 17:16.560* :  A man in southern England has entered the record books
*17:16.700- 17:18.880* :  for being the longest-serving lifeguard.
*17:24.480- 17:27.140* :  What stories and advice would you like to share with daughters
*17:27.880- 17:27.900* :  everywhere?
*17:28.220- 17:29.900* :  And what are different countries around the world
*17:29.900- 17:33.060* :  getting right in order for women to live well and succeed?
*17:33.760- 17:35.660* :  Where to be a woman is the brand-new podcast
*17:35.660- 17:38.720* :  exploring in which countries women are living their best lives
*17:38.720- 17:41.020* :  and what the rest of the world could learn from them.
*17:41.440- 17:43.900* :  And my award-winning podcast, Dear Daughter,
*17:43.900- 17:45.380* :  is back for a new season.
*17:45.960- 17:49.240* :  Join me, Namulanta Kumball, as I update my handbook
*17:49.240- 17:50.700* :  to life for daughters everywhere.
*17:51.060- 17:53.700* :  Search for Where to Be a Woman and Dear Daughter
*17:54.020- 17:55.760* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:00.960- 18:03.120* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*18:03.220- 18:07.220* :  UN Health officials say the number of cases of dengue fever
*18:07.220- 18:10.420* :  across the Americas has trebled in the first three months
*18:10.440- 18:13.640* :  of the year compared to the same period in 2023.
*18:13.860- 18:17.580* :  Our America's regional editor Leonardo Russia reports.
*18:18.660- 18:21.500* :  The Pan-American Health Organization, a UN agency
*18:21.500- 18:26.720* :  that represents 35 countries, says that more than 3.5 million cases
*18:26.720- 18:29.100* :  of dengue have been reported in the region
*18:29.540- 18:31.180* :  over 1,000 people have died.
*18:31.680- 18:33.980* :  The worst affected countries are Brazil, Argentina,
*18:33.980- 18:37.640* :  in Peru, which last month declared a national health emergency.
*18:38.200- 18:40.900* :  Most cases of the mosquito-borne disease are mild,
*18:41.300- 18:43.780* :  but it can cause the debilitating muscle-enjoined pain
*18:43.780- 18:47.520* :  and high temperature, which often require hospital treatment.
*18:48.200- 18:50.060* :  Health experts say climate change
*18:50.060- 18:53.500* :  and the El Nino phenomenon have created the ideal conditions
*18:53.500- 18:56.180* :  for the spread of the dengue transmitting mosquito.
*18:56.980- 18:57.860* :  Leonardo Russia,
*18:58.760- 19:01.020* :  you might think you know all about the effects
*19:01.020- 19:03.480* :  of global warming, but what about this one?
*19:03.860- 19:06.440* :  It's making the Earth rotate more slowly.
*19:06.960- 19:09.220* :  So much so that the next leap second,
*19:09.400- 19:13.060* :  the extra second that gets added to reconcile clock time
*19:13.060- 19:15.140* :  to the actual movement of the Earth,
*19:15.520- 19:17.940* :  may well get added three years later
*19:17.940- 19:19.640* :  than was previously expected.
*19:20.260- 19:22.260* :  It's because water, which has melted
*19:22.260- 19:25.740* :  from the polar ice caps, moves towards the equator.
*19:26.380- 19:28.640* :  Johnny Diamond spoke to the director of the Center
*19:28.640- 19:31.660* :  for Polar Observation and Modeling Andrew Shepherd,
*19:32.160- 19:35.720* :  so could time really be affected by the movement of water?
*19:36.680- 19:37.220* :  Yeah, it is.
*19:37.240- 19:41.040* :  So this water was previously on top of the Greenland ice sheet
*19:41.240- 19:42.720* :  or the Antarctic ice sheet.
*19:43.500- 19:45.760* :  And when it melts, it goes into the oceans
*19:45.760- 19:49.400* :  and we know about that because it causes sea levels to rise.
*19:50.220- 19:51.940* :  But there's also a more subtle effect
*19:51.940- 19:56.060* :  and it means that the mass moves towards the equator
*19:56.060- 19:57.600* :  and spread evenly around the planet.
*19:57.960- 20:00.120* :  And that actually causes the planet to slow down
*20:00.120- 20:03.460* :  in the same way that a ballerina spinning wood
*20:03.460- 20:05.600* :  slow down if they move their arms outwards.
*20:05.820- 20:10.120* :  I mean, I know that those who have to bring the leap second in
*20:10.280- 20:11.760* :  are actually fairly relieved about it
*20:11.760- 20:13.900* :  because it plays havoc with everybody's calculations
*20:13.960- 20:14.940* :  and clocks.
*20:15.600- 20:18.820* :  But this is more significant than a leap second here or there.
*20:18.820- 20:21.700* :  This is another sort of message from the Earth
*20:21.700- 20:22.740* :  that things are changing.
*20:23.480- 20:25.420* :  Yeah, I mean, it's another bad news story,
*20:25.420- 20:29.480* :  unfortunately, but it's a good example of how climate change
*20:29.480- 20:32.580* :  affects all kinds of different parts of our lives.
*20:32.900- 20:35.880* :  You might not think it's important that the Earth is slowing down,
*20:35.880- 20:39.380* :  but that changes all of the satellite telecommunications
*20:39.380- 20:42.760* :  that we rely on and people have to take account of that
*20:42.760- 20:47.000* :  to make sure that the GPS system is as precise as we want it to be.
*20:47.460- 20:49.100* :  And all of that has to go on in the background
*20:49.160- 20:51.220* :  because, of course, we don't program those satellites
*20:51.220- 20:52.540* :  but everyone else has to.
*20:52.800- 20:55.220* :  Are you surprised by this, by this finding?
*20:55.700- 20:59.320* :  So it's quite interesting that the fingerprint of climate change
*20:59.320- 21:01.520* :  crops up in all kinds of different records.
*21:01.520- 21:04.600* :  I was quite surprised to see the geodocysts
*21:04.600- 21:07.940* :  people who look at the Earth and time have spotted it.
*21:07.940- 21:10.640* :  And I guess they were saying what's going on here?
*21:10.840- 21:11.600* :  Something must be happening.
*21:11.600- 21:13.480* :  And they're not climate scientists.
*21:13.760- 21:16.800* :  So they had to hunt around for the source of this
*21:16.900- 21:19.040* :  and then realized to stumble upon the fact
*21:19.040- 21:22.640* :  that our polarized sheets are melting at a colossal rate.
*21:22.640- 21:24.920* :  And so they have to join the dots.
*21:25.700- 21:29.560* :  Andrew Shepard from the Centre for Polar Observation and Modeling.
*21:30.680- 21:32.940* :  Unprofessional, dirty, and wild.
*21:33.600- 21:37.240* :  Those were the words used to describe Kenza's Afro-style hair
*21:37.240- 21:39.840* :  when she was looking for a job at the age of 17.
*21:40.500- 21:43.580* :  The online campaigner is one of many people in France
*21:43.580- 21:47.120* :  who say they've been discriminated against because of their hair.
*21:47.660- 21:50.680* :  But on Thursday, a new bill was approved by the French
*21:50.880- 21:53.100* :  lower house of Parliament that would forbid
*21:53.100- 21:54.620* :  this sort of discrimination.
*21:54.920- 21:58.200* :  Our Paris correspondent Hugh Scofield told me more.
*21:58.940- 22:02.440* :  What the man behind this law is saying is that it may sound frivolous.
*22:02.440- 22:03.640* :  It may sound not very serious.
*22:03.660- 22:05.340* :  It may sound a bit of a joke, but it's not.
*22:05.840- 22:09.860* :  Because he's saying that there is a reality under which people
*22:09.860- 22:13.480* :  are being discriminated against because of their hair.
*22:13.800- 22:16.300* :  The building drafted so that it's not specific
*22:16.840- 22:18.780* :  to any gender or any race.
*22:19.100- 22:22.800* :  And he says red-headed people are discriminated against sometimes.
*22:22.800- 22:24.940* :  And blonde people are discriminated against sometimes.
*22:24.940- 22:28.300* :  You know, the old cliches about blonde people are stupid
*22:28.300- 22:29.280* :  and all this sort of stuff.
*22:29.280- 22:30.620* :  Even bald people, he says, are.
*22:31.000- 22:32.760* :  So they're included in this.
*22:32.820- 22:36.940* :  But it's quite clear that the main reason for this law is black people.
*22:36.940- 22:40.400* :  The pressure that some of them have felt historically
*22:40.400- 22:45.160* :  and still today to straighten their hair, to redesign their hair,
*22:45.160- 22:50.120* :  to make it more acceptable to norms that prevail in Western societies and so on.
*22:50.340- 22:53.300* :  I mean, for example, there was the famous case of a man,
*22:53.300- 22:56.120* :  black man who was a flight attendant on their France,
*22:56.740- 22:59.260* :  and there was a big row about his hair,
*22:59.760- 23:02.220* :  which ended with the Air France being taken to court.
*23:02.320- 23:05.960* :  So is this bill on the idea of banning discrimination against hair
*23:05.960- 23:07.680* :  a big talking point in France?
*23:08.340- 23:12.100* :  It would be wrong to claim this is grabbing the attention of the country.
*23:12.100- 23:12.460* :  It's not.
*23:12.920- 23:14.760* :  For a start, this is just the lower house upon.
*23:14.760- 23:19.200* :  It's got to go the upper house upon, and there's no guarantee it'll pass through the upper house.
*23:19.440- 23:22.680* :  It's a sort of law that I think people are finding it very hard to say no to,
*23:22.680- 23:26.720* :  because, of course, everyone agrees in principle with the idea that it's wrong
*23:26.720- 23:28.620* :  to discriminate on any grounds.
*23:29.360- 23:30.780* :  Hughes co-filled in Paris.
*23:31.840- 23:35.220* :  You would expect one of the world's most prestigious universities
*23:35.220- 23:38.160* :  to have some peculiar items in its collections.
*23:38.900- 23:42.040* :  But Harvard University in the United States has removed the book
*23:42.040- 23:47.100* :  from one of its libraries because of its binding made of, wait for it, human skin,
*23:47.940- 23:48.900* :  and a bit no reports.
*23:50.100- 23:53.440* :  Harvard University boasts 20 million books in its collection,
*23:53.440- 23:56.520* :  but one has a particularly macabre fascination.
*23:57.060- 23:59.360* :  The 19th century work, Dead Destiny, D'Alem,
*23:59.360- 24:03.920* :  which means destinies of the soul is a dark meditation on life after death.
*24:03.940- 24:08.060* :  The author, Hansen Husset, gifted a copy to his friend Ludovic Boulond,
*24:08.460- 24:11.320* :  a psychiatrist who bound the book with the skin of a patient
*24:11.320- 24:14.780* :  who died in his care, a woman we don't know the name of.
*24:15.220- 24:18.020* :  Harvard's had it in its collection for 90 years,
*24:18.020- 24:22.680* :  but it was in 2014 when scientists confirmed human DNA in the binding.
*24:23.380- 24:26.980* :  The way the university publicised the news was heavily criticised at the time,
*24:26.980- 24:30.500* :  where book collectors called for it to be removed on ethical grounds,
*24:30.500- 24:34.300* :  launching an open letter in the student newspaper, The Harvard Crimson.
*24:34.300- 24:37.160* :  Madeline Proctor is one of their staff editors.
*24:37.800- 24:41.460* :  Yeah, so it's my understanding that there's sort of been a lower on campus
*24:42.020- 24:45.700* :  about potentially disrespectful treatment of it being a hazing and ritual
*24:45.700- 24:50.380* :  for new members of the library or something like that, 2014, when it was tested.
*24:50.800- 24:54.800* :  That time, Harvard Library announced the fact that it was indeed human skin
*24:55.220- 24:56.660* :  in two separate blog posts.
*24:57.080- 25:00.260* :  The dark and joking nature of those blog posts is something that,
*25:00.400- 25:02.900* :  you know, the Harvard Library apologises for.
*25:03.300- 25:04.860* :  After 10 years of controversy,
*25:04.860- 25:07.080* :  Harvard has now removed the binding of the book,
*25:07.080- 25:10.720* :  saying it had not lived up to ethical standards of care.
*25:11.120- 25:14.760* :  It added it was looking for ways to ensure the remains will be treated respectfully
*25:14.900- 25:17.740* :  to restore dignity of the anonymous patients.
*25:18.280- 25:22.940* :  Harvard's not the only university agonising over how to deal with historic collections
*25:22.940- 25:24.660* :  featuring human material,
*25:25.200- 25:28.280* :  but few problems are quite as gruesome as this one.
*25:28.880- 25:29.580* :  Ella Bicknell.
*25:30.380- 25:35.200* :  The beach abormoth in southern England may not have the sunny glamour of Malibu,
*25:35.200- 25:38.580* :  but try telling that to 74-year-old Chris Lewis.
*25:39.180- 25:42.340* :  He's just dived into the book of Guinness World Records
*25:42.340- 25:44.400* :  as the longest-serving lifeguard.
*25:45.000- 25:49.500* :  Chris's career began in the English Coastal Resort 58 years ago
*25:49.980- 25:53.460* :  as a 16-year-old volunteer for the local lifeguard corps,
*25:53.940- 25:56.900* :  and he's still patrolling the beach for the RNLI,
*25:56.900- 25:59.540* :  the Royal National Lifeboat Institute.
*25:59.540- 26:02.220* :  He told James Kummer-Sami more.
*26:03.000- 26:05.740* :  It's something that I really enjoy doing,
*26:05.740- 26:10.460* :  so I just have such a good time as a lifeguard,
*26:10.880- 26:13.100* :  you know, helping other people on the beach.
*26:13.100- 26:15.600* :  I mean, my two favourite activities.
*26:16.380- 26:18.160* :  It's a serious business, of course, isn't it?
*26:18.180- 26:21.080* :  You are the person responsible for saving lives.
*26:21.080- 26:26.540* :  Tell us, what are the memorable moments of your life saving career?
*26:26.800- 26:28.020* :  About 10 years ago, no.
*26:28.380- 26:31.700* :  I had one incident that was particularly memorable.
*26:32.340- 26:35.560* :  I was patrolling, and we've got wooden groins
*26:35.560- 26:38.040* :  that go out in the sea to trap sand.
*26:38.340- 26:41.200* :  And when you've got the wind from the southeast
*26:41.440- 26:44.220* :  and the tide going out, you can have quite a strong current.
*26:44.560- 26:46.480* :  So on this particular day, I look down
*26:46.480- 26:52.060* :  and I see a group of people gradually drifting into that sort of dodgy area.
*26:52.060- 26:55.520* :  So I run off down the beach just as I get there.
*26:55.520- 26:58.580* :  This one girl who was 16 years of age
*26:58.580- 27:03.220* :  gets picked up by a wave and slapped right into the end of the groin.
*27:03.300- 27:06.520* :  And there was quite a lot of blood all over the place.
*27:06.960- 27:11.180* :  But she also had her brother who was hanging on to the groin
*27:11.180- 27:14.200* :  sticking out into the water, which is covered in barnacles.
*27:14.580- 27:16.360* :  It's lots of little cats all over him.
*27:16.860- 27:20.440* :  And in a third little boy who was swimming, 10 metres out.
*27:20.820- 27:24.640* :  So I went rescue the three of them, as I was walking out,
*27:24.640- 27:28.800* :  to my amazement, the whole beach stood up and applauded.
*27:29.180- 27:30.880* :  That's the most outstanding thing,
*27:30.880- 27:32.520* :  not because of what I did,
*27:32.520- 27:35.040* :  but the response of the people on the beach.
*27:35.580- 27:36.520* :  And what about equipment?
*27:36.520- 27:38.100* :  I think you started off with a rowing boat.
*27:38.420- 27:43.280* :  In the 70s, I worked as a boatman and you were safety patrol.
*27:43.880- 27:46.940* :  They gave you one rowing boat and a rescue boy.
*27:47.780- 27:50.960* :  So used to go out, chuck an anchor out,
*27:51.260- 27:52.720* :  have a look, see what was going on.
*27:53.380- 27:57.620* :  The whole of Bournemouth Beach, there was seven lifeguards.
*27:58.120- 28:02.340* :  In the summer now, we get nine lifeguards
*28:02.540- 28:06.020* :  very close to Bournemouth Pier, never mind the whole beach.
*28:06.380- 28:10.000* :  Now, I'm going to ask you about Baywatch and Glamour.
*28:10.340- 28:11.960* :  When Baywatch was at its height,
*28:11.960- 28:15.720* :  the life of a lifeguard seemed to people watching television
*28:15.720- 28:17.260* :  to be an extremely glamorous one.
*28:17.460- 28:18.520* :  What's your experience?
*28:18.920- 28:22.540* :  My experience of that is that when Baywatch came along,
*28:22.960- 28:25.360* :  although, yes, there was a little bit of glamour in it.
*28:25.360- 28:28.180* :  Most people tend to think of it as a bit of a joke
*28:28.580- 28:31.460* :  and didn't take it seriously because of that.
*28:31.700- 28:35.760* :  So Baywatch wasn't necessarily a good thing for lifeguards?
*28:36.260- 28:38.900* :  Well, it promoted some good things,
*28:39.460- 28:42.860* :  but then the actual individuals that were doing stuff,
*28:43.220- 28:47.180* :  you know, provided a very stereotypical view
*28:47.180- 28:48.840* :  of what a lifeguard should look like.
*28:48.840- 28:54.220* :  And, you know, I'm perfect example of a non-stereotypical lifeguard.
*28:54.680- 28:55.840* :  Yeah, I'm now 74,
*28:56.520- 28:59.520* :  so I can't imagine any of the lifeguards on Baywatch
*28:59.520- 29:02.100* :  being more than 27 things, so.
*29:02.760- 29:04.740* :  Would you have swapped Bournemouth for California?
*29:05.200- 29:06.360* :  No, no, Bournemouth's great.
*29:06.360- 29:07.900* :  A lifeguard is good.
*29:08.760- 29:12.420* :  Chris Lewis, still lifeguarding at the age of 74.
*29:15.280- 29:16.760* :  And that's all from us for now,
*29:16.760- 29:20.020* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*29:20.480- 29:24.160* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
*29:24.400- 29:25.540* :  you can send us an email.
*29:25.540- 29:29.920* :  The address is globalpodcastatbbc.co.uk.
*29:29.920- 29:33.720* :  You can also find us on X at Global News Podcast.
*29:34.180- 29:36.460* :  This edition was mixed by Callum McLean.
*29:36.460- 29:38.420* :  The producer was Liam McChephry.
*29:38.640- 29:40.360* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*29:40.840- 29:41.680* :  I'm Rachel Wright.
*29:41.760- 29:43.380* :  Until next time, goodbye.
