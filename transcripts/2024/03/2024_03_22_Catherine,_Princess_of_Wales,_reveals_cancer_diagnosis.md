*01:14.340- 01:16.280* :  from the BBC World Service.
*01:18.220- 01:19.020* :  I'm Janet Gillil.
*01:19.020- 01:21.380* :  Welcome to a special breaking news edition
*01:21.380- 01:25.100* :  of the Global News Podcast recorded at 2030 GMT
*01:25.500- 01:27.540* :  on Friday the 22nd of March.
*01:28.300- 01:32.060* :  Catherine, the Princess of Wales, is undergoing treatment for cancer.
*01:32.640- 01:35.160* :  She revealed the diagnosis in a video statement.
*01:35.980- 01:38.280* :  It has taken me time to recover from major surgery
*01:38.840- 01:40.040* :  in order to start my treatment.
*01:41.020- 01:44.540* :  But most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything
*01:44.540- 01:48.180* :  to George Charlotte and Louis in a way that's appropriate for them
*01:48.800- 01:50.620* :  and to reassure them that I'm going to be okay.
*01:52.340- 01:54.200* :  We look at what this means for the princess
*01:54.460- 01:58.160* :  and the royal family after weeks of speculation about her health.
*01:58.960- 02:02.420* :  Also, at least 40 people have been killed in a gun attack
*02:02.420- 02:04.060* :  at a concert hall near Moscow.
*02:04.760- 02:06.080* :  Explosions have also been heard.
*02:06.920- 02:11.200* :  Israel tells America's top diplomat on his latest visit to Tel Aviv
*02:11.620- 02:14.120* :  that it will go ahead with its planned offensive
*02:14.120- 02:16.140* :  in the crowded Guards and City of Raffa
*02:16.580- 02:19.260* :  with or without US support.
*02:23.920- 02:27.280* :  The Princess of Wales has revealed that she's being treated for cancer.
*02:27.960- 02:29.680* :  Catherine stepped back from royal duties
*02:29.680- 02:32.040* :  when she had abdominal surgery in January.
*02:32.500- 02:34.700* :  After weeks of speculation on social media
*02:34.700- 02:37.400* :  about the princess's health, she released a video.
*02:37.780- 02:41.620* :  In it, she said she had initially thought her condition was non-cancerous
*02:42.020- 02:45.300* :  but subsequent tests had found that cancer was present.
*02:46.060- 02:48.900* :  She said it had been an incredibly tough couple of months
*02:48.900- 02:52.220* :  for her and her family and that she was undergoing chemotherapy
*02:53.060- 02:55.140* :  and getting stronger every day.
*02:56.040- 02:58.440* :  Let's play you that video statement in full.
*03:00.440- 03:03.020* :  I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you,
*03:03.020- 03:06.060* :  personally, for all the wonderful messages of support
*03:06.060- 03:09.600* :  and for your understanding whilst I'd been recovering from surgery.
*03:10.420- 03:13.680* :  It has been an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family
*03:14.580- 03:16.160* :  but I've had a fantastic medical team
*03:16.580- 03:19.140* :  who have taken great care of me for which I'm so grateful.
*03:20.160- 03:23.260* :  In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London
*03:24.040- 03:27.440* :  and at the time it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous.
*03:28.240- 03:30.480* :  The surgery was successful however,
*03:30.480- 03:33.760* :  tests after the operation found cancer had been present.
*03:35.220- 03:38.460* :  My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of
*03:38.520- 03:42.420* :  preventative chemotherapy and I'm now in the early stages of that treatment.
*03:43.620- 03:48.360* :  This of course came as a huge shock and Willem and I have been doing everything we can
*03:48.360- 03:52.660* :  to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family.
*03:53.280- 03:54.920* :  As you can imagine, this has taken time.
*03:55.980- 04:00.040* :  It has taken me time to recover for major surgery in order to start my treatment
*04:01.000- 04:05.920* :  but most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George Charlotte and Louis
*04:06.720- 04:10.600* :  in a way that's appropriate for them and to reassure them that I'm going to be okay.
*04:11.520- 04:13.140* :  As I've said to them, I am well.
*04:13.780- 04:17.200* :  I'm getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal
*04:17.800- 04:19.440* :  in my mind, body, and spirits.
*04:20.620- 04:24.480* :  Having Willem by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance to you
*04:25.300- 04:29.120* :  as is the love, support, and kindness that has been shown by so many of you.
*04:29.800- 04:31.120* :  It means so much to us both.
*04:32.200- 04:38.160* :  We hope that you'll understand that as a family we now need some time, space, and privacy
*04:38.880- 04:43.140* :  while I complete my treatment. My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy
*04:43.780- 04:45.500* :  and I look forward to being back when I may well.
*04:46.480- 04:49.220* :  But for now, I must focus on making a full recovery.
*04:50.420- 04:54.940* :  At this time, I'm also thinking of all those whose lives are being affected by cancer.
*04:56.260- 05:01.880* :  For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope.
*05:02.780- 05:03.580* :  You are not alone.
*05:05.400- 05:09.100* :  Our British affairs correspondent Rob Watson said it was a stunning development.
*05:09.820- 05:13.660* :  A shock to her, clearly a shock to the family, and a shock to the nation.
*05:13.660- 05:16.920* :  I have to pause for a second, Janette, and say it's pretty extraordinary.
*05:16.920- 05:22.780* :  I mean, I can't remember a senior member of the Royal family and the sort of 40 odd years I've
*05:22.780- 05:28.040* :  been working for the BBC, feeling the need to make a statement like this.
*05:28.040- 05:31.740* :  And clearly Kate and the Royal family have felt right that we couldn't have
*05:31.740- 05:34.460* :  all the sort of rumour mongering going on any longer.
*05:34.680- 05:35.580* :  So I picked that out.
*05:36.320- 05:38.080* :  But obviously, I pick out from a statement.
*05:38.140- 05:41.980* :  I mean, one is the acknowledgement that whatever surgery she had in January was major.
*05:42.260- 05:43.580* :  I mean, that was pretty striking.
*05:44.200- 05:48.860* :  Second, of course, was her talking of preventative chemotherapy, the implication being that
*05:49.540- 05:55.520* :  whatever surgery was done, the chemotherapy is a precaution and is road to recovery and sort of
*05:56.240- 05:57.020* :  safety first.
*05:57.380- 06:01.020* :  And then the third thing that I picked out, of course, with that line about her saying that she's
*06:01.020- 06:02.200* :  going to be okay.
*06:02.880- 06:04.380* :  And then the fact she was getting stronger.
*06:04.380- 06:09.180* :  I thought also interestingly the way she referred to William being by her side.
*06:09.180- 06:14.100* :  And I think that is perhaps intended to scotch some of those other rumours that have been out.
*06:14.100- 06:16.460* :  They're not just about her health, but about her relationship.
*06:16.540- 06:21.220* :  And then, of course, there was the appeal for privacy and space and time and just
*06:21.620- 06:23.320* :  that's an extraordinary moment, really.
*06:23.460- 06:26.280* :  I don't know whether this will calm down any of the speculation.
*06:26.440- 06:30.440* :  I'm pretty sure that it would be a safe bet, Janette, to say that the British
*06:30.440- 06:36.680* :  tabloid newspapers, one imagines will start to rally behind the royal family and certainly behind
*06:36.680- 06:42.040* :  her princess Kate in the light of the statement, which I think is going to soften many hearts.
*06:42.740- 06:46.080* :  Absolutely, because she has had to contend not only with her health issues, but
*06:46.400- 06:52.800* :  this frenzy of interest on social media with these outlandish conspiracy theories being touted.
*06:53.240- 06:56.880* :  And now perhaps a lot of people will be feeling a little bit ashamed of themselves,
*06:56.880- 07:00.640* :  because this is a woman, a young woman with three young children, as you said,
*07:00.640- 07:06.940* :  who is simply asking for time, space and privacy to deal with a very serious illness.
*07:07.180- 07:10.620* :  It's interesting that you raised that, Janette. I was wondering whether to say that in the last
*07:10.620- 07:16.480* :  answer, whether maybe some of the people who've been speculating over time and overdrive on social
*07:16.480- 07:22.480* :  media will think, and maybe I went too far, what sort of analysts of the royal family and the way
*07:22.480- 07:28.840* :  modern public relations work have said is that, look, inevitably, when there is in this kind of age
*07:28.840- 07:33.300* :  that we live in, Janette, an information gap, I mean, people will fill it, right? And you could say
*07:33.300- 07:38.440* :  it's naive, it's unfortunate, it's not a great world we live in, but that is the reality and that's
*07:38.440- 07:44.460* :  the reality of the royal family has come up against. Rob Watson. Despite the appeals for privacy,
*07:44.460- 07:49.480* :  there is intense interest in the princess's health. Our health correspondent Catherine Burns
*07:49.480- 07:55.580* :  told us what we do and what we don't know. So we know that she had major abdominal surgery in
*07:55.580- 08:00.640* :  January. We know that at the time it was thought her condition was not cancerous and that the surgery
*08:00.640- 08:07.580* :  was a success, but tests after the operation found that cancer had been present, which the princess
*08:07.580- 08:12.620* :  describes as a huge shock. We also know that her medical team wanted to have a course of what
*08:12.620- 08:18.460* :  she's calling preventative chemotherapy, and she started that at the end of February. She said to
*08:18.460- 08:23.460* :  be in good spirits and that does come across in her video to a certain extent. I was really struck
*08:23.460- 08:29.280* :  by the fact that she said, I am going to be okay. I am well and getting stronger every day. I must
*08:29.280- 08:34.420* :  focus on making a full recovery. And they've said, why this has come out now. They said, you know,
*08:34.420- 08:39.560* :  first of all, she had major surgery to recover from. Then she had to get her head around this new
*08:39.560- 08:45.020* :  diagnosis and be there for her children as they did the same. Now she feels ready as her children
*08:45.020- 08:49.760* :  are starting their Easter holidays to put this news out in the world and also to have her children
*08:49.760- 08:54.520* :  at home for the next few weeks where she can look after them. But there is a lot that we don't know.
*08:54.520- 09:00.160* :  We don't know what that initial operation was for. We don't know what kind of cancer is or what
*09:00.160- 09:06.120* :  stage it was at. And we won't be told that. And we won't be speculating about it either because she
*09:06.120- 09:13.040* :  does have this right to medical privacy. But what we do know is some overall facts about cancer. So in
*09:13.040- 09:19.620* :  the UK, she is now one of three million people living with cancer. Someone is diagnosed with it
*09:19.620- 09:26.560* :  every 90 seconds. That's more than a thousand people a day in the UK. We also know that most of
*09:26.560- 09:32.700* :  those cases offer older people about a third of them are for people who are over 75. So her age,
*09:32.700- 09:36.640* :  her relatively young age will hopefully be a positive factor in her recovery.
*09:37.840- 09:44.240* :  Catherine Burns. Well, the news about Catherine Princess of Wales comes weeks after it was revealed
*09:44.240- 09:50.660* :  that King Charles has also been diagnosed with cancer. Members of the Royal Family carry out about
*09:50.660- 09:56.240* :  two thousand engagements every year. A home editor, Mark Easton, considers what it will mean
*09:56.320- 10:01.420* :  not having the Princess of Wales to call on. Catherine Zilness and her absence from the front
*10:01.420- 10:06.820* :  line of Royal Duties is a huge blow for the Royal Family, already struggling to keep the show on
*10:06.820- 10:12.000* :  the road with the King's cancer treatment, restricting his availability, and also the absence of
*10:12.000- 10:17.460* :  the Sussexes, Harry and Meghan, as well as for very different reasons, Prince Andrew. The slimmed
*10:17.460- 10:22.980* :  down Royal Family now looks dangerously stretched. Prince William will return to public duties when
*10:22.980- 10:27.720* :  his children go back to school in the middle of April. But he will of course want to spend considerable
*10:27.720- 10:33.820* :  time with his wife and to be around for George, Charlotte and Louis. Queen Camilla has repeatedly
*10:33.820- 10:39.540* :  stepped in for her husband since King Charles' cancer diagnosis, but at 76 the palace will not
*10:39.540- 10:45.260* :  want to increase her workload too much more. Other working royals are already at close to full
*10:45.260- 10:50.620* :  throttle and it seems inevitable that there will be significant pruning of planned royal visits
*10:50.620- 10:55.920* :  and appointments. Kate, as the world knows her, has been the model of wholesome healthy normality,
*10:55.920- 11:01.920* :  acting as a vital dose of ordinaryness in the House of Windsor. But the Princess of Wales is also
*11:01.920- 11:07.740* :  a global superstar, repeatedly voted one of the most influential women in the world. In Britain,
*11:07.740- 11:14.300* :  she is the most popular of all the royals. The Kate effect is such that the dresses she wears will
*11:14.300- 11:20.560* :  sell out within hours of the photos hitting Instagram. The UK monarchy will be weaker without Catherine
*11:20.560- 11:26.040* :  around and the institutions already reeling from a king who is unwell and are family driven by
*11:26.040- 11:28.740* :  scandal and quarrel. They will miss her.
*11:29.900- 11:36.360* :  Marguestan, and now to our other breaking news story, at least 40 people have been killed after
*11:36.360- 11:46.860* :  an attack on a concert hall near Moscow. That was a sound of hundreds of people trying to escape
*11:46.860- 11:53.260* :  the crocus concert hall in Krasnogorsk after camouflage gummin entered the building and started
*11:53.260- 11:57.000* :  firing. This man was among those in the concert hall at the time.
*11:58.380- 12:05.080* :  I was sitting in the hall upstairs where the balconies were. We had gunshots. At first we didn't
*12:05.080- 12:12.000* :  understand what was happening. Then I personally saw how the terrorist came in, started shooting
*12:12.000- 12:17.400* :  everyone. In the end, they threw a petrol bomb. Everything was set on fire.
*12:18.140- 12:24.980* :  We were alert to the exit. It turned out the exit was locked. We ran all over the crocus city
*12:24.980- 12:31.420* :  trying to find an exit but to no avail. We went into the basement of the crocus city hall and
*12:31.420- 12:38.480* :  waited for the emergency services and got out. We got more on this developing story from our
*12:38.480- 12:44.720* :  Russia editor Steve Rosenberg. This is what we know so far. This evening, a number of armed men
*12:44.780- 12:50.680* :  stormed into the crocus city hall which is quite a famous concert hall on the edge of Moscow.
*12:51.340- 12:57.220* :  How many attackers between two and five reports say we don't know the actual figure and they
*12:57.220- 13:02.720* :  started shooting. 70 ambulances were called to the scene. Explosions have been heard from inside
*13:02.720- 13:08.300* :  the building. The crocus city hall is reported to be on fire with still people inside.
*13:08.460- 13:13.940* :  Russian special forces have been called to the scene and a few minutes ago there were reports
*13:13.980- 13:19.480* :  that they have started to storm the building. The assumption is that there are still attackers
*13:20.140- 13:26.860* :  inside but also Moscow police say they are hunting for a gunman who may have escaped from the scene.
*13:26.860- 13:33.380* :  So a very confused picture at the moment. Security has been stepped up at airports and train stations
*13:33.380- 13:39.800* :  across Moscow also. All sporting events, cultural events have been cancelled in the Russian capital
*13:40.280- 13:46.580* :  because of this. The Moscow mayor has called these events a terrible tragedy and the Russian
*13:46.580- 13:52.360* :  foreign ministry has called it a bloody terrorist attack. And the timing of this is interesting
*13:52.420- 13:58.580* :  isn't it because it comes days after elections were held in Russia which Mr Putin won by a landslide
*13:58.580- 14:03.560* :  which was denounced by many as a sham because no viable candidates were really standing against him.
*14:03.700- 14:09.200* :  And it also comes as Russia has just launched one of its biggest attacks on Ukraine since it's
*14:09.200- 14:14.960* :  war and Ukraine started. I think we have to be careful at this point in linking this to anything.
*14:14.960- 14:20.720* :  We don't know who these gunmen are or we know is that they were in camouflage and they were
*14:20.720- 14:25.120* :  gunmen and they started shooting. We don't know who they are. So I think for the moment
*14:25.180- 14:30.580* :  because the very uncertain situation going on there we shouldn't speculate about links to the

*16:35.500- 16:39.620* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. There are further signs of a growing
*16:39.620- 16:45.040* :  rift between Israel and its most important ally, the United States, over the war in Gaza.
*16:45.660- 16:49.600* :  The American Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, held talks in Tel Aviv on Friday,
*16:50.180- 16:55.840* :  urging the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to mount a major military operation
*16:55.840- 17:02.100* :  in Gaza's southernmost city, Raffa. It's become a giant refugee camp, sheltering more than a
*17:02.180- 17:08.140* :  million displaced Palestinians. But Mr Netanyahu says his country will go ahead with the planned
*17:08.140- 17:13.860* :  ground assault on Raffa, with or without US backing. Our State Department correspondent,
*17:13.860- 17:21.380* :  Tom Bateman, is traveling with Mr Blinken. On the tarmac in Tel Aviv, the welcome flags were
*17:21.380- 17:25.960* :  out for Anthony Blinken. But like the hulking gray military plane he arrived in,
*17:25.960- 17:30.940* :  the day was without much of the usual fuss or niceties. At the Ministry of Defense,
*17:30.940- 17:34.880* :  he sat with the Israeli war cabinet before talks with Benjamin Netanyahu.
*17:35.200- 17:40.700* :  The US-Israel relationship is under severe stress, as Washington, which is Israel's biggest
*17:40.700- 17:46.280* :  military backup, has been unable to ensure enough humanitarian aid is getting into Gaza.
*17:46.960- 17:52.020* :  A UN-backed food security assessment has said a man-made famine in Gaza is imminent.
*17:52.760- 17:56.540* :  After his meetings, Mr Blinken spoke to those of us in the press, traveling with him.
*17:57.160- 18:03.620* :  A hundred percent of the population of Gaza is acutely food insecure. A hundred percent
*18:04.380- 18:09.440* :  is in need of humanitarian assistance. There have been some positive steps taken in recent days
*18:10.200- 18:15.020* :  to improve the situation, but it's not enough. And we talked about what needs to happen
*18:15.700- 18:20.320* :  to get much more assistance to many more people more effectively.
*18:21.660- 18:25.500* :  The Americans also oppose an Israeli ground assault into the city of Rafa.
*18:25.980- 18:31.460* :  But Mr Netanyahu, like members of his ultra-nationalist coalition, has publicly push back at the US
*18:31.460- 18:36.560* :  further straining relations. Speaking after his discussions with the US Secretary of State,
*18:37.000- 18:40.340* :  Mr Netanyahu said Israel would act to protect its citizens.
*18:41.160- 18:46.620* :  I told Mr Blinken that we have no way to defeat Hamas without entering Rafa and eliminating
*18:46.620- 18:51.020* :  the rest of the battalions there. And I told him that I hope we'll do it with the support of
*18:51.020- 18:54.300* :  the United States. But if we have to, we'll do it alone.
*19:00.500- 19:04.480* :  While he was in Tel Aviv in his motorcade, Mr Blinken left his armoured vehicle
*19:04.480- 19:08.560* :  and greeted a small group of protesters calling for a hostage release deal.
*19:08.560- 19:13.400* :  We're working to bring them home. Mr Blinken said as he walked down a line of people behind
*19:13.400- 19:20.600* :  a barricade who chanted, thank you, Blinken, and we trust you. In a move probably time to embarrass
*19:20.600- 19:25.580* :  Mr Blinken, Israel's far-right finance minister, Batsal al-Smotrich, announced that Israel was
*19:25.580- 19:30.560* :  seizing a further sway of land in the occupied West Bank, which activists called the largest
*19:30.560- 19:37.340* :  action of its kind in decades. Tom Bateman, the war in Gaza was sparked by the Hamas attacks in
*19:37.340- 19:42.820* :  October in which more than 1,000 Israelis were killed. Since then, the children of Gaza have
*19:42.820- 19:50.540* :  paid a terrible price. UN Children's Agency UNICEF says more than 13,000 children have been
*19:50.540- 19:57.580* :  killed by Israeli forces and thousands more left orphans. One of them is 12-year-old Alma,
*19:57.580- 20:02.800* :  who's now sheltering in Rafa. She was the only member of her family to survive a blasting
*20:02.800- 20:08.400* :  Gaza city. A senior international correspondent, Ola Garen, reports on Alma's story.
*20:09.080- 20:15.960* :  Well, Alma is a 12-year-old girl who was living with her family in an area of downtown Gaza City.
*20:15.960- 20:22.360* :  After the war began, she told us they moved several times. Her parents were desperately trying
*20:22.360- 20:28.440* :  to keep the family safe, but she said in each location they went to the first, the second,
*20:28.440- 20:34.320* :  and then the third. There was bombing in the area, and on the third occasion, the bomb actually
*20:34.320- 20:40.920* :  landed on the five-story building in which Alma was sheltering not just with her family, but she
*20:40.920- 20:50.200* :  says with about 140 other refugees. Now, she is a remarkably strong, bright, intelligent girl,
*20:50.200- 20:56.580* :  and we had wanted to tell the story of an orphan in Gaza, but we wanted to find a child who was
*20:56.680- 21:02.220* :  well enough, who was old enough, and who was ready to tell that story. And we were put in touch
*21:02.220- 21:07.740* :  with Alma. Of course, we got permission from her aunt and uncle who were taking care of her now,
*21:07.740- 21:14.880* :  as she's now living with them and their children in a tent in Rafa, but Alma was able to give us a very
*21:15.660- 21:22.160* :  detailed account of the events of the night and morning in which she was trapped underneath the
*21:22.160- 21:28.220* :  rubble, and that was the morning of December 2nd, and we were able to obtain the rescue video that
*21:28.220- 21:37.480* :  lets us hear exactly what happened when rescuers heard her voice calling out. A shout from under the
*21:37.480- 21:47.280* :  rubble, I'm Alma. Can you see my light? Asks Muth, the rescue worker.
*21:47.900- 21:56.020* :  I swear I'll get to you. Alma asks for her sister and brothers.
*22:02.760- 22:10.700* :  Bravo, Alma, he says, as she emerges after three hours buried alive. Where are your brothers
*22:10.700- 22:18.540* :  and sisters? He asks. They're over here, she says, and my mom is over there.
*22:23.100- 22:30.580* :  I am 12 years old and the only survivor of my family. The first place we fled to was bombed
*22:31.300- 22:37.680* :  and the second, and in the third place, the bomb hit us. They were all killed.
*22:39.760- 22:46.000* :  We were happy together as a family, though we were scared. We used to hug each other tightly out of fear.
*22:49.540- 22:55.100* :  I hoped my brother Tarazan would still be alive. I was calling out to him.
*22:56.960- 23:05.080* :  I found him in an unimaginable state. His head severed. What a memory for a child to carry.
*23:08.200- 23:15.940* :  I wish for that after seeing my brother like that. He was only 18 months old. What has he done in
*23:15.940- 23:23.000* :  this world? Now it's very hard to try and put figures on all of this, but we did get one estimate
*23:23.000- 23:29.000* :  from a respected, independent Palestinian human rights group that has field workers on the ground
*23:29.000- 23:35.120* :  in Gaza, and they told us that according to their most recent estimates, which was at the end of
*23:35.120- 23:42.100* :  February, there are about 20,000 children who have been orphaned by the war in Gaza, but they
*23:42.100- 23:47.960* :  also emphasized that the real figure could be much higher because of the difficulty and the danger
*23:48.680- 23:54.600* :  of trying to gather information in Gaza. All are given. The upper house of the German federal
*23:54.600- 24:01.460* :  parliament has removed the final hurdle, which stood in the way of the partial legalisation of cannabis.
*24:02.140- 24:06.700* :  The law, which comes into effect on April 1st, will allow people to consume the drug,
*24:06.700- 24:12.280* :  but specifies that smoking it in public spaces in Germany should be banned. Damian McGinnis reports
*24:12.280- 24:18.360* :  from Berlin. From April 1st, adults in Germany will be allowed to possess up to 25 grams of
*24:18.360- 24:24.040* :  cannabis for personal use. That's enough for dozens of joints, but sales of the drug will be
*24:24.040- 24:29.080* :  strictly controlled. People will either be able to grow their own, three plants will be allowed
*24:29.080- 24:35.140* :  for personal use, and limited amounts of cannabis will also be available in state regulated members
*24:35.140- 24:40.740* :  clubs. For decades, politicians in Germany have been arguing over whether to legalise cannabis,
*24:41.380- 24:46.740* :  or position conservatives believe this will simply fuel drug abuse. But the left wing led
*24:46.740- 24:52.480* :  government says that controlled legalisation will undermine the black market and make product safer.
*24:53.200- 24:57.720* :  What most people in Germany can agree on is that the strategy so far hasn't worked,
*24:57.720- 25:02.040* :  with soaring drug use among young people and a booming black market.
*25:03.040- 25:07.660* :  Damian McGinnis. And finally, she's a grandmother and a video gaming sensation.
*25:08.220- 25:13.400* :  75-year-old Cath Bowie from Scotland became interested in video game Fortnite after seeing her
*25:13.400- 25:18.340* :  grandson play it. She now spends up to six hours on it and has thousands of followers.
*25:18.340- 25:23.660* :  This report from Catchy on a Renton. This is the oldest Fortnite player in the world,
*25:24.100- 25:31.240* :  Rumpy Grand 1948. Cath Bowie was introduced to the online video game by her grandson, Lewis.
*25:31.760- 25:38.440* :  One day, I just walked into his bedroom and it was the very first week that Fortnite came out
*25:38.480- 25:44.040* :  and I saw this screen and I can't explain why it was just instant love.
*25:44.280- 25:47.140* :  Cath suggested to Lewis that she might have a go at streaming.
*25:47.140- 25:53.020* :  And he was just that typical 18-year-old. You can't do that. You can't stream. Nobody will watch
*25:53.020- 25:59.120* :  you. You'll never have any followers, right? So of course, now he's eating his words.
*25:59.780- 26:01.280* :  It's very, very nice to meet you.
*26:01.740- 26:05.100* :  Half teamed up with American YouTuber Cipher PK.
*26:05.100- 26:08.800* :  Here we go. Here we go. The pair got on famously.
*26:11.080- 26:13.180* :  Oh my, I can't see them, but oh, that's another thing.
*26:13.560- 26:15.540* :  PK, I forgot to tell you. I've got bad eyesight.
*26:15.680- 26:20.180* :  And made a great team. He seemed a little lovely. He just had a good time as well.
*26:20.220- 26:24.180* :  Let's go! And they won. First game, first win.
*26:25.140- 26:28.900* :  And Grumpy Grand, 1948, had a victory song.
*26:39.020- 26:46.820* :  That was Grumpy Grand, 1948, otherwise known as Cath Bowie, ending that report by Catriona Renton.
*26:49.600- 26:54.000* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later.
*26:54.140- 26:57.880* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered, you can send us an email.
*26:57.880- 27:02.060* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*27:02.920- 27:07.440* :  This edition was mixed by Dan Erlich. The producers were Sean Wales and Anna Murphy.
*27:07.440- 27:11.440* :  The editor is Karen Martin. And Janutth Gillil. Until next time, goodbye.
