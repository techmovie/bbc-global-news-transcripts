*01:00.400- 01:07.980* :  BBC World Service. I'm Andrew Pageant at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 12th of March. These are our
*01:07.980- 01:13.620* :  main stories. Haiti's Prime Minister Ariel Henri has agreed to resign after weeks of mounting
*01:13.620- 01:20.240* :  pressure and increasing violence. An age ship towing 200 tons of humanitarian assistance is on its way
*01:20.240- 01:26.420* :  to Gaza. The army in Sudan says it sees the state broadcaster in the city of Omdaman the significant
*01:26.420- 01:34.880* :  gain in its war with the paramilitary RSF. Also in this podcast. And then I fire four questions
*01:34.880- 01:41.960* :  like bullets at the witness. Bang, bang, bang, bang. From Broadway to bookshelves how hit play,
*01:41.960- 01:49.700* :  star and Jodie Coma became a novel. Haiti's Prime Minister is on his way out.
*01:49.700- 01:54.240* :  Powerful gangs calling for Ariel Henri to go have been attacking key government targets
*01:54.740- 01:59.560* :  across the capital, Porto-Prince since the end of February. Henri's resignation came out
*01:59.560- 02:04.400* :  to regional leaders, including the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken met on Monday in Jamaica
*02:04.400- 02:09.780* :  to talk about a political transition in Haiti. You can firm he'd step down once a transitional
*02:09.780- 02:19.520* :  council was created. After the council of ministers tonight accepted to put into place a
*02:19.520- 02:25.020* :  transitional presidential council, the members of the council will be picked after agreement is
*02:25.020- 02:29.820* :  reached with different sectors of the executive. The government I'm running will then step back
*02:29.820- 02:35.780* :  immediately after the establishment of this new council. The guineas president Mohammed Irfan Ali
*02:35.780- 02:40.540* :  chaired Monday's talks. The people of Haiti are suffering and are being killed
*02:41.260- 02:49.440* :  indiscriminately. Too many have had to flee for their lives while women have been violated
*02:49.440- 02:56.260* :  and children traumatized. More Haitians have died in these four months of 2024
*02:57.420- 03:02.300* :  than in the war in Ukraine. Mr. Henri has currently stranded in Puerto Rico after being
*03:02.300- 03:08.380* :  prevented from going home by armed gangs. Harold Isaac is a Canadian freelance journalist in Haiti
*03:08.380- 03:15.780* :  and spoke to my colleague Martha Carney. He had been besieged by anger of the streets here in Haiti
*03:15.780- 03:22.500* :  where there are protests against him and the gangs finally raised against him in the last
*03:22.500- 03:28.580* :  couple weeks. And just described to us what it's been like in Haiti since then the kind of
*03:28.580- 03:33.820* :  campaign of violence that you've been seeing. Well the last wave of violence has taken a big
*03:33.820- 03:40.380* :  toll on the city on Port of France mainly and also the country essentially by having port facilities
*03:40.380- 03:45.840* :  being attacked in essentially cutting us from the world with attacks against the airport that
*03:45.840- 03:51.600* :  is currently shut down and that has led to an aggravation of the humanitarian situation where
*03:51.600- 03:58.780* :  both the WFP and the UNICEF to UN agencies have warned of imminent risk of famine in the
*03:58.780- 04:04.500* :  metropolitan area of Port of France. Given the kind of power that the gangs have in Haiti,
*04:05.260- 04:09.060* :  what kind of prospect do you think there is for any kind of peaceful transition?
*04:09.920- 04:16.460* :  Well it's anybody's guess at this point. The part of the path forward laid by the international
*04:16.460- 04:22.080* :  community and the caracombs countries in agreement with Haitian stakeholders is to have a seven
*04:22.080- 04:27.500* :  member presidential council that would lead the destiny of the country going forward and leading
*04:27.500- 04:34.340* :  to elections. But the feasibility of such a formula that we've never seen remains to be tested
*04:34.340- 04:40.640* :  and prove it. And do you think that would mean bringing in some of the gang leaders to allow them
*04:40.640- 04:46.400* :  to have any kind of role in governing the country? Well so far it hasn't been the case. They've
*04:46.400- 04:52.280* :  indicated the sectors that would be selected. Now these sectors have to issue their choice
*04:52.280- 04:57.620* :  their picks for the individuals that will represent them. And so far it hasn't been the case. But
*04:57.620- 05:04.740* :  it's clear that the gangs will certainly have their way in the discussions with their weapons.
*05:05.400- 05:10.900* :  Howard Isaac with Martha Carney. And if you'd like to know more about Haiti's gang crisis, you can hear
*05:10.900- 05:17.320* :  an episode of the Global Jigsaw by searching for the explanation wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*05:18.300- 05:23.240* :  Now to guys that wear the BBC has seen evidence that doctors, nurses and other hospital staff were
*05:23.240- 05:28.040* :  detained, beaten and prevented from carrying out their duties when Israeli forces over
*05:28.040- 05:33.480* :  around the NASA hospital last month. We've also heard accusations that some detainees were stripped
*05:33.480- 05:39.400* :  and kept in stress positions for several hours. Israel said it occupied the hospital in Karniunis,
*05:39.400- 05:44.280* :  believing it was being used by Hamas. And several released Israeli hostages have said they were
*05:44.280- 05:53.040* :  held there. Alice Cutty reports. An Israeli soldier wheels a patient in a hospital bed
*05:53.380- 05:59.520* :  along the perimeter driveway. A drone can be heard hovering overhead. The bed is rattled,
*05:59.520- 06:04.580* :  passed a line of men on their knees, hands on their heads, stripped to their underwear,
*06:05.300- 06:10.080* :  son with their hospital scrubs in front of them. Watching the treatment of his staff with
*06:10.080- 06:18.940* :  NASA's Dremel manager, Dr. Atef Al-Hoot. Anybody who tried to move his head or make any movement
*06:18.940- 06:26.620* :  got hit. They left them for around two hours in this shameful position. Then those arrested were
*06:26.620- 06:32.460* :  taken to a building to be interrogated. Their screams filled all the space inside.
*06:32.960- 06:39.080* :  The BBC has spoken to a number of medical staff detained by the IDF at NASA. Their accounts
*06:39.080- 06:45.680* :  offer corroboration of serious abuse of medical staff at the hands of Israeli soldiers while
*06:45.680- 06:50.280* :  in captivity. Dr. Ahmed Abu Sapa worked in the emergency room.
*06:53.640- 06:58.360* :  They put me on a chair and it was like a gallows. I started praying because I thought I'd be
*06:58.360- 07:05.440* :  executed. In the end, it was all to scare me. Filming her colleagues being lined up from a
*07:05.440- 07:14.300* :  nearby building was Dr. Ahmed Abu Sapa. It was harmful for us to see how doctors who insisted
*07:14.760- 07:20.920* :  to the last minute to remain in danger were stripped naked, beaten. They sacrificed their families
*07:21.740- 07:31.680* :  and themselves to serve the patients and the people. The war had arrived at NASA long before that day.
*07:34.260- 07:40.280* :  Its resources were already under critical strain. In the weeks prior to the raid,
*07:40.740- 07:43.740* :  military activity around the hospital intensified.
*07:47.920- 07:51.920* :  On February 8th, a nurse was shot in the chest while in the surgical department.
*07:54.880- 07:58.900* :  The hospital ground came under repeated small arms fire in this period.
*08:01.100- 08:05.840* :  Videos show medical staff running for cover in the courtyard after shots are heard.
*08:07.600- 08:12.900* :  In another, a crack of gunfire can be heard before an injured man crawls back through the hospital
*08:13.340- 08:19.660* :  bleeding heavily. Dr. Ahmed Abu Ghrabi posted this update on social media at the time.
*08:30.420- 08:36.040* :  And in another, dead bodies can be seen at the hospital gates left to rot. Those inside
*08:36.040- 08:41.200* :  were too scared to retrieve them. The IDF says there was active fighting in the area,
*08:42.360- 08:46.220* :  but only precise shots were fired at terrorists in the hospital's vicinity.
*08:48.880- 08:53.720* :  On the 15th of February, Dr. Asuli filmed a tank entering the hospital perimeter.
*08:54.480- 09:01.600* :  The raid now underway. The IDF described the raid as a limited operation and released its own videos.
*09:06.580- 09:12.180* :  They say her mass weaponry was found on the site, as well as medication marked for known Israeli
*09:12.180- 09:17.600* :  hostages. Some previously freed hostages testified being held there.
*09:18.760- 09:25.520* :  Israel describes those arrested as terrorist suspects, some 200 in total, and says some had been
*09:25.520- 09:31.780* :  disguised as medics. Dr. Ahmed Abu Sapa and the detained medical staff we spoke to,
*09:32.280- 09:38.060* :  say they received no charges. At some point, the men were blindfolded and transported out of the
*09:38.060- 09:45.280* :  complex. They believed to Israel. They took us from one location to another. At one, there was
*09:45.280- 09:50.740* :  a pit in the ground, and we thought they would execute us and bury us. All the medics we
*09:50.740- 09:57.200* :  spoke to report sustained physical assault after they were moved. Dr. Abu Sapa describes one incident.
*09:57.440- 10:04.060* :  I was standing with my hands raised above my head, and my face was looking down for hours.
*10:04.780- 10:10.240* :  Then a soldier asked me to come to him. When I did, he kept hitting my hand until it was broken.
*10:10.880- 10:16.320* :  Responding to these allegations, the IDF said any abuse of detainees is contrary to its orders,
*10:16.620- 10:22.400* :  and is strictly prohibited. They specifically denied the allegation of mock executions.
*10:23.620- 10:29.320* :  British from NASA after the raid show it now exists as an abandoned shell. Its life saving work
*10:29.520- 10:36.420* :  has ceased. Many other medics from NASA believe to still be in detention. Their location is unknown.
*10:37.740- 10:44.060* :  Now it's cutie reporting. On Tuesday, a boat loaded with 200 tons of age set sail from Cyprus
*10:44.060- 10:49.460* :  sailing across the Mediterranean to Gaza. Currently facing a humanitarian crisis, the health
*10:49.460- 10:54.860* :  care system is in tatters, aid agencies, a warning of starvation. Quentin Somerville was in
*10:54.860- 11:01.420* :  LaLaca as the ship left port. We expect it will take perhaps as much as two days to get to Gaza
*11:01.420- 11:05.280* :  because of the size of the ship. It's just a little ship and the weight of the cargo.
*11:05.800- 11:10.520* :  And when it gets there, it faces another challenge. As you were saying, Gaza is in utter disarray.
*11:10.760- 11:15.100* :  Much of the infrastructure has been destroyed by Israeli bombardment. So the charity behind
*11:15.100- 11:21.040* :  this cargo world central kitchen, it's an American charity, is as we speak, building a jetty
*11:21.040- 11:26.280* :  using rubble from the destruction in Gaza so that when that cargo does eventually arrive, they're
*11:26.280- 11:31.160* :  able to offload it and then begin to distribute it. Distributing it to obviously will have a lot
*11:31.160- 11:35.200* :  of challenges because they want to get the aid to northern Gaza where things are particularly bad
*11:35.620- 11:39.540* :  and there's a state of lawlessness because of the war. Most aid groups aren't even delivering
*11:39.540- 11:44.900* :  there now. The process you've just described is not at all an efficient way of getting aid into
*11:44.900- 11:49.500* :  somewhere but I guess every little helps. Yes, but it is a little. My back of the envelope
*11:49.500- 11:55.020* :  calculation is that if this new maritime corridor and the hope is that once this ship gets there,
*11:55.020- 12:01.380* :  plenty others will follow it, would need to deliver 50 of those barges every single day just to meet
*12:01.380- 12:06.620* :  Gaza's needs. There is an easier way of doing that. You send a bike truck over the Rafa crossing
*12:06.620- 12:13.500* :  and inform Israel and Egypt. But despite pleading from the international community, Israel is still
*12:13.500- 12:19.300* :  got a stranglehold on those particular crossings. It's letting through only a fraction of the trucks
*12:19.300- 12:25.120* :  needed for security concerns. Every piece of aid that goes in there, every bag of flour and cement
*12:25.120- 12:30.500* :  and grain has to be inspected so that nothing gets into the hands of Hamas, nothing that we did, Hamas.
*12:31.020- 12:34.980* :  Also worth bearing in mind that the Americans too are planning their own maritime corridor but that
*12:34.980- 12:41.160* :  won't be operational at least for another month. It is the much talk of international cooperation
*12:41.160- 12:47.440* :  between governments and agencies and charities to get more ships rolling behind this one, you know,
*12:47.440- 12:53.780* :  if this works. Yes, Cyprus is pretty keen on making this and ongoing operation where in the style
*12:53.780- 12:58.760* :  of a Berlin airlift, I suppose, that you would get a constant stream of vessels going there.
*12:59.080- 13:02.960* :  They told us the other day in fact that there is another vessel in port which is being prepared
*13:02.960- 13:09.040* :  to send aid if this one is successful. It's a whole range of countries that are involved in this
*13:09.040- 13:16.060* :  one tiny shipment, the United Arab Emirates, Europe, of course, the American charity and the
*13:16.060- 13:21.760* :  reality though is that the responsibility ultimately for making sure that the people of Gaza
*13:22.580- 13:27.440* :  have enough food and have enough water lies with the occupation force and that's Israel.
*13:27.440- 13:30.320* :  And many respects this has been handed over to the international community.
*13:30.900- 13:37.060* :  Quentin Savavel in Cyprus. Next to Sedan where the army says it's taken the state broadcaster
*13:37.060- 13:41.920* :  in the city of Andaman after heavy fighting. Troops have been clashing with the paramilitary
*13:41.920- 13:47.000* :  rapid support forces as they try to recapture large parts of Andaman and the capital,
*13:47.000- 13:53.820* :  Khartoum. Africa editor Will Ross has more. Some of the videos have shown the aftermath of the
*13:53.820- 14:00.160* :  latest battle for control of the state broadcaster in Andaman and the Sudanese army posting some
*14:00.160- 14:04.580* :  videos including sort of celebrations outside the building and within the facility,
*14:05.480- 14:12.700* :  some of the soldiers taking items seemingly from on the ground next to dead fighters from the RSF
*14:12.700- 14:18.820* :  forces. Interesting also that the state broadcaster hasn't actually been on air from that facility
*14:18.820- 14:25.440* :  since the war began because straight after the fighting began in April last year, the RSF seized
*14:25.440- 14:31.660* :  that building but the military government managed to keep the state broadcaster on air from a
*14:31.660- 14:38.480* :  different location so no actual sort of capture of functioning facility but some concern over the
*14:38.480- 14:43.380* :  archives whether there's much left of the archives inside the building and there's also talk of
*14:43.440- 14:48.780* :  some people were being held as prisoners there so we may hear more about that. This is a bit of a
*14:48.820- 14:52.660* :  turn in events though because in recent months every time we've spoken about what's happening
*14:52.660- 14:57.400* :  in Sedan it's always been that the RSF the rapid support forces have been making advances.
*14:58.160- 15:03.820* :  That's right especially in Khartoum and the three areas that make up Khartoum including
*15:03.820- 15:10.100* :  Andaman on the other side of the River Nile. We're not quite sure why there's been what appears
*15:10.100- 15:15.460* :  to be things going in favor of the army at the moment but certainly this was a sort of sustained
*15:15.460- 15:22.620* :  attack and there have been some gains that the armies reported over the last few days in Andaman
*15:22.620- 15:29.060* :  but when you look at the country as a whole the RSF is still extremely powerful it still holds
*15:29.060- 15:34.880* :  most of the Darfur region in the west of the country and still a lot of the capital despite
*15:34.880- 15:42.020* :  calls for a ceasefire during Ramadan it seems that people are determined to fight on fight for
*15:42.020- 15:46.980* :  control of what is a country that's really being smashed to pieces. Our Africa editor will
*15:46.980- 15:52.380* :  Ross with me. Romanian police have arrested the social media influencer Andrew Tate and his brother
*15:52.380- 15:57.960* :  Tristan over alleged sex offenses committed in Britain. The two men were detained late on Monday
*15:57.960- 16:03.260* :  after European arrest warrants were issued by the UK authorities. Ella Bignol has been following
*16:03.260- 16:09.680* :  the story. Well you can say Andrew Tate is proud of his controversial reputation as a social media
*16:09.680- 16:15.200* :  influencer. He got into a Twitter war with Greta Thunberg and his misogynist videos have seen
*16:15.200- 16:19.900* :  in band from YouTube and other social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok and Facebook.
*16:20.380- 16:25.440* :  Despite those bands he's hugely popular especially amongst young men in Britain and abroad
*16:25.980- 16:31.480* :  on Twitter for a while now known as X. He's a masked almost nine million followers.
*16:31.500- 16:37.320* :  Why are the Tate brothers in Romania? Well Andrew and his brother Tristan moved from the UK to
*16:37.320- 16:42.420* :  Romania five years ago they called it a cheaper place to live and a place with very beautiful women.
*16:42.920- 16:46.820* :  Even at today's court hearing Andrew Tate called Romania his home and expressed his wishes to
*16:46.820- 16:51.820* :  clear his name there. They have also been prevented from leaving Bucharest as they face separate
*16:51.820- 16:58.320* :  charges in Romania of rape, human trafficking and exploitation which were issued in December 2022
*16:59.000- 17:03.580* :  until they come to trial they're actually not allowed to leave the country. Just a little bit more
*17:03.580- 17:08.340* :  about what's happened today and the allegations that we're now talking about in the news.
*17:09.200- 17:14.840* :  So we're told these allegations are from four British women dating back to events from 2012
*17:14.840- 17:19.260* :  up to 2015, accusing the brothers of rape and sexual assault.
*17:19.700- 17:23.460* :  Lawyers representing the alleged victims say they've had information that Andrew Tate might have
*17:23.460- 17:28.140* :  been planning to flee Romania and on those grounds they urge British police to extradite him
*17:28.500- 17:32.560* :  and an arrest warrant was released yesterday the Romanian authorities detained the brothers late
*17:32.560- 17:36.680* :  last night and we've just had an update from the court in Bucharest to say that the verdict
*17:36.680- 17:41.080* :  is postponed and the Tate will remain in custody and the brothers deny all allegations.
*17:41.620- 17:45.800* :  Had a bit more reporting regarding those UK allegations, lawyers for the Tate brothers say
*17:45.900- 17:48.720* :  they would challenge them with unwavering determination.
*17:51.220- 17:52.340* :  Still to come on this podcast?
*17:52.600- 18:00.120* :  Paganini himself said I leave my violin to the city of Genoa that it be perpetually preserved.

*18:41.040- 18:45.980* :  fuel depots. Meanwhile, the governor of Russia's western Kursk region says the Russian army
*18:45.980- 18:51.720* :  stopped an incursion by ground troops from Ukraine. Kiev says the attack was actually carried out
*18:51.720- 18:57.000* :  by Russian volunteers fighting against President Putin's government. The city of Kursk closed schools
*18:57.000- 19:02.380* :  in response and changed to online classes instead. James Waterhouse told me more from Kiev.
*19:03.040- 19:09.640* :  It seems to be the case at least that Ukraine is carried out a widespread drone attack on
*19:09.640- 19:16.480* :  Russia's western flank. According to authorities across the border, 25 were intercepted across
*19:16.480- 19:24.080* :  nine regions and as you say the targets seem to be oil depots, where a storage tank was targeted
*19:24.080- 19:30.520* :  as well as a refinery itself and one governor in the Belgorod region has said one village came under
*19:31.040- 19:38.220* :  artillery fire from Ukrainian forces. We haven't had any confirmation from Kiev but this is
*19:38.220- 19:44.700* :  a kind of continuation of its strategy to try and make strikes deeper into Russian territory
*19:44.700- 19:52.120* :  which clearly looked to frustrate Russia's ability to fuel its invasion of Ukraine to a degree
*19:52.120- 19:57.600* :  but this sort of pales in comparison to what Russia inflicts the other way. We've had another
*19:57.600- 20:03.220* :  night of multiple drone attacks across the country but nevertheless Ukraine seems content to
*20:03.220- 20:08.660* :  continue with these much smaller counter punches. And what about these reports of an incursion by
*20:08.660- 20:15.200* :  Ukrainian forces into Russia and that is dispute about exactly what's gone on there? This is much
*20:15.200- 20:20.460* :  less clear. Now we have seen this before. We're talking about three groups, three Italians called
*20:20.460- 20:26.440* :  the Freedom of Russia Legion, the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Siberian Battalion. These are
*20:26.440- 20:33.340* :  Russian nationals based in Ukraine who have in the past as well as reportedly today made
*20:33.340- 20:39.300* :  incursions into Russia. Now they have quite the PR operation. They said they were sort of trying
*20:39.300- 20:44.240* :  to overthrow the dictatorship at the time of the presidential elections. There is some fighting
*20:44.460- 20:50.120* :  according to some sources but it's far less clear what effect this will have where you have the
*20:50.120- 20:54.840* :  Russian saying they've killed 100 fighters and repelled the attack and Ukraine said nothing to do
*20:54.840- 20:59.060* :  with us because they are Russian nationals. James Walter has our correspondent in Kiev.
*20:59.800- 21:06.180* :  The world's most exported fruit is in danger. Bananas are becoming more expensive to grow and buy
*21:06.180- 21:11.100* :  because of climate change. Escalating temperatures present an enormous threat to the world's
*21:11.100- 21:16.480* :  banana production so much so that the world banana forum is meeting in Rome to talk about its
*21:16.480- 21:22.240* :  future. The UN's leading banana economist Pascal Liu warns of a substantial and enduring
*21:22.240- 21:26.500* :  price search. Rob Young spoke to our environment correspondent Matt McGraw.
*21:26.920- 21:30.520* :  The threat comes in a number of different ways. Rising temperatures are making it more difficult
*21:30.520- 21:35.940* :  to produce bananas in some locations. There's weather impacts, hurricanes in various tropical regions
*21:35.940- 21:40.300* :  where bananas are grown. The big worry they're having is about what are called the compound effects
*21:40.580- 21:45.400* :  of climate change which means essentially the spreading of disease and disease is a real problem
*21:45.400- 21:50.480* :  for banana growers at this moment in time. One called fuzzarium wilt which is spread around the world
*21:50.960- 21:55.600* :  and it is really enhanced if you like by climate conditions. It's being spread by floods,
*21:55.600- 22:01.880* :  it's a tough fungus and it's a real threat to plantation owners and growers the whole world over.
*22:02.000- 22:04.900* :  Which parts of the world are perhaps most affected by this?
*22:05.040- 22:09.220* :  It's essentially all over. The problem for growers at the moment is that the most commercial
*22:09.220- 22:13.040* :  banana that's eaten around the world, the Cavendish variety, up to now that's been
*22:13.200- 22:18.160* :  essentially protected from this disease fuzzarium wilt but now there's a mutation that allows
*22:18.160- 22:23.280* :  that fungus to attack this type of banana as well. It's those type of effects combined with
*22:23.280- 22:28.100* :  the rise in energy costs, the rise in fertilizer costs, the rise in insurance costs for shipping,
*22:28.380- 22:32.840* :  all those are putting huge upward pressure and you consider that the price of bananas for the
*22:32.840- 22:38.460* :  last 30 years in many countries has been very stable, very low from the producer's perspective.
*22:38.820- 22:42.920* :  All of this is leading economists to believe there's going to be continual rises in banana
*22:42.920- 22:48.180* :  prices and that those rises will stay high, that bananas, which might have been once considered
*22:48.180- 22:54.260* :  a very cheap snack or a cheap food, essentially could become much more expensive than they are now.
*22:54.500- 22:59.880* :  Our environment correspondent, Matt McGraw, in Thailand, if you insult the king, you could get 15
*22:59.880- 23:06.000* :  years in prison. A new political party wanted to change all of that, that she won most votes
*23:06.000- 23:11.340* :  in the last elections and now they could be dissolved by the country's constitutional court.
*23:11.340- 23:16.020* :  It's pretty controversial because the move forward party seems so popular.
*23:16.440- 23:20.720* :  I spoke to our Asia-Pacific editor, Mickey Bristo. Yeah, it goes back to the elections,
*23:20.720- 23:25.760* :  you just mentioned, they moved forward party, they got the most votes, the most seats in parliament,
*23:25.760- 23:32.560* :  but one of their policies was to change the Les Majes De Law in Thailand, a very strict law
*23:32.560- 23:38.860* :  which is used to curb any kind of criticism of the monarchy and very broadly defined. As you
*23:38.860- 23:43.680* :  suggested there, they moved forward party, they didn't form a government after the election and now
*23:43.680- 23:48.580* :  conservative forces in Thailand seem to be moving against them. In January this year,
*23:49.000- 23:56.740* :  the constitutional court said that policy of trying to reform the Les Majes De Law was actually
*23:56.740- 24:01.880* :  trying to undermine the whole democratic system in Thailand. They said that and now the
*24:01.880- 24:06.520* :  election commissioner said, well, seen as a court, through all that, we want the party dissolved.
*24:06.540- 24:10.200* :  If it does happen, that will probably happen in the next couple of weeks.
*24:10.200- 24:16.800* :  These conservative forces in Thailand are pretty powerful. They stop the most popular party in an
*24:16.800- 24:21.520* :  election from running the country and now it looks like they'll be got rid of all together.
*24:21.520- 24:26.280* :  We're talking about the military here. We are talking about the military. It is strange when
*24:26.280- 24:31.160* :  you look at it from the outside, Thailand purports to be a democracy, but here you have a political
*24:31.160- 24:36.260* :  party running in an election saying what policies it would enact if it got into power.
*24:36.580- 24:40.700* :  That's all it was doing. It wasn't suggesting a military over the throw of the authorities,
*24:40.700- 24:46.780* :  the king toppled from power, anything like that. It was merely suggesting a democratic process,
*24:47.340- 24:52.820* :  but in Thailand, political parties have been dissolved before when the military, the court,
*24:52.820- 24:57.420* :  and these conservative courts all get together to try and house somebody who's
*24:57.860- 25:00.400* :  looking to change the society.
*25:00.920- 25:06.460* :  Mickey Bristow reporting. Now, even at 280 years old, one of the world's most valuable
*25:06.460- 25:09.220* :  violins sounds as impressive as ever.
*25:16.580- 25:21.680* :  This instrument is the Il Canoni violin, which once belonged to the celebrated 18th century Italian
*25:21.680- 25:27.260* :  composer Nicolò Paganini. Now experts are attempting to discover the secret of its magical sound
*25:27.260- 25:31.720* :  by taking detailed x-rays of the instrument. Chantal Hartle explains.
*25:32.360- 25:37.380* :  To the untrained eye, this may seem like an ordinary violin, outbrowning colour with a slightly
*25:37.380- 25:43.860* :  curved neck, but it's the sound that it produces that sets it apart, with Paganini himself naming it
*25:43.860- 25:49.720* :  the canon because of its power and projection. Over the years, only a handful of international
*25:49.720- 25:55.420* :  musicians have had the chance to play the famous violin. In his will, Paganini gifted the instrument
*25:55.420- 26:00.140* :  to his home city of Genoa and it rarely leaves the town hall where it's displayed.
*26:00.140- 26:05.740* :  It's currently on loan to the French city of Grenoble, where scientists at a top cultural
*26:05.740- 26:11.680* :  heritage repair workshop are scanning the violin in meticulous detail to understand why it plays
*26:11.680- 26:18.480* :  such beautiful music. The idea is to create a 3D model so people can zoom down to a micron
*26:18.480- 26:24.860* :  or a millionth of a meter. Scientists Paul Taffra says so far their work has shown the violin is in
*26:24.860- 26:36.940* :  good condition considering its age. When we go down to 4 microns or 2 microns, you can see
*26:36.940- 26:44.060* :  every cell in the wood and if there's even a micro crack, you can see all the details,
*26:44.140- 26:53.380* :  the exact depth. In the case of this particular violin, we scanned it at 30 microns to make a map
*26:53.380- 27:01.580* :  of any defects. In the end, we found very few. The teams say the logistics of transporting
*27:01.580- 27:07.560* :  the violin safely from Italy to France was a big challenge. It was ensured for a value of 32
*27:07.560- 27:13.580* :  million dollars for the journey. Bruce Carlson is tasked with preserving the violin in Genoa.
*27:13.920- 27:19.000* :  He said having a better understanding of its sound quality would ensure Paganini's wishes are
*27:19.000- 27:26.900* :  respected. Paganini himself said, I leave my violin to the city of Genoa that it be perpetually
*27:26.900- 27:33.020* :  preserved and so now we are better able to understand the instrument and better able to
*27:33.020- 27:39.460* :  conserve the instrument. The process of analysing the x-rays is expected to take several months.
*27:39.880- 27:44.940* :  According to one expert, the guiding principle for any potential restoration work on this
*27:44.940- 27:51.180* :  incredibly valuable instrument is to exercise extreme caution or abstain altogether.
*27:57.740- 28:01.620* :  Chantal Hartle reporting now before we close the curtains on this podcast.
*28:11.780- 28:17.320* :  A hit West End Performance, a transfer to Broadway and an upcoming film adaptation.
*28:17.320- 28:23.040* :  The National Theatre's play, Primer Faces, had many faces. It follows a criminal barista who
*28:23.040- 28:28.100* :  specialises in defending people accused of sexual assault, who's then assaulted herself.
*28:28.220- 28:34.120* :  Now the play begins a new chapter as a novel. Jodie Coma, who won a Tony on Broadway for her role,
*28:34.120- 28:39.180* :  has recorded the audiobook. The prosecutor can't say anything but his eyes.
*28:40.020- 28:44.980* :  They are begging him to be careful, begging the witness not to fall into the trap laid out before him.
*28:45.740- 28:50.500* :  I see all this and then I fire four questions like bullets at the witness.
*28:51.480- 28:57.020* :  Bang, bang, bang, bang. The players inspired change to some legal processes here in the UK.
*28:57.020- 29:01.500* :  Martha Carney spoke to the writer Susie Miller, herself a former criminal defense lawyer,
*29:01.780- 29:05.880* :  ahead of the book's release in the UK this week. Do you know it was actually delightful,
*29:05.880- 29:11.680* :  it was lovely to sort of sit for long periods and just write into a character and know that there
*29:11.680- 29:15.920* :  was no limit to how much I could write, like I don't have to cut it down to 90 minutes.
*29:16.220- 29:23.880* :  And it has a very strong words to say about the way the little system treats victims of rape and
*29:23.880- 29:27.740* :  it's had an impact, it hasn't it on the law in England. Actually at the Old Bailey Court,
*29:27.780- 29:32.420* :  there's parity of gender now with judges. So there's a lot of women judges that are very high up
*29:32.420- 29:36.880* :  in the Old Bailey Court, which is the first time that's come about. And actually two of those
*29:36.880- 29:42.140* :  women judges who had read the story or seen the play have actually made significant changes
*29:42.140- 29:45.980* :  and spoken to be about those changes after seeing it and actually reading the story.
*29:46.100- 29:49.580* :  What kind of changes? Well, one of them called me at 90 in one morning and said,
*29:49.580- 29:55.260* :  I saw the play, but she said, you know, I actually am a judge that decides what said to the jury,
*29:55.260- 30:00.600* :  what the judge must read out to the jury in each of the, each of the criminals aspects of the court.
*30:01.080- 30:06.640* :  And I have sat up all night and I've rewritten what the judge must now say to the jury about
*30:06.640- 30:10.960* :  sexual assault and rape and I've used words from the story. Right. It's sort of the work is going
*30:10.980- 30:16.660* :  in both directions. And I think you're giving talks to baristas, aren't you? I am. But you know,
*30:16.660- 30:20.560* :  there's this great thing like one of the other judges actually has made it compulsory viewing for
*30:20.560- 30:25.520* :  all the judges in Northern Ireland to watch a video of the show so that they before they sit on
*30:25.520- 30:30.000* :  rape cases, I went to the UN and talked about how art can affect change while I was launching
*30:30.000- 30:36.520* :  the book in the US. And also there's a group of baristas led by some really exciting young criminal
*30:36.520- 30:41.700* :  baristas that have set up the Tessa project, which is Tessa is the name of the protagonist of the book.
*30:42.260- 30:47.020* :  But she it's also an acronym for the examination of serious sexual assault law and there's a group
*30:47.020- 30:52.260* :  of very passionate, very smart baristas that are putting together suggestions for policy change
*30:52.260- 30:55.020* :  within the legislation. The writer Susie Miller.
*30:57.200- 31:00.640* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
