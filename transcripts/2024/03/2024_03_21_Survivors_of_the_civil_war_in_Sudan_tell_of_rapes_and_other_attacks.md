*04:07.220- 04:10.700* :  She responds, never raising her eyes to look at me.
*04:11.960- 04:13.160* :  A day before we met,
*04:13.560- 04:17.040* :  the 19-year-old refugee from the Darfur region of Sudan
*04:17.540- 04:19.120* :  found out that she is pregnant.
*04:20.040- 04:22.000* :  She is here today to begin an abortion,
*04:22.620- 04:23.600* :  desperately hopping,
*04:23.940- 04:25.440* :  her family never find out.
*04:27.840- 04:29.380* :  The incident happened in Sudan.
*04:30.200- 04:30.880* :  I'm not married.
*04:31.480- 04:32.700* :  I had never been with a man,
*04:32.840- 04:34.560* :  except for the incident that happened.
*04:35.140- 04:36.000* :  I didn't tell anyone.
*04:36.640- 04:37.660* :  I don't think anyone knows.
*04:38.180- 04:39.300* :  I just came to see a doctor
*04:39.300- 04:41.240* :  because I didn't have my period for two months,
*04:41.740- 04:43.140* :  and I have pain in my abdomen.
*04:43.980- 04:45.620* :  Amina, whose name we have changed,
*04:46.240- 04:47.540* :  is one of a huge number
*04:47.540- 04:49.480* :  who have been repped or sexually assaulted
*04:49.480- 04:50.720* :  during the conflict in Sudan.
*04:51.680- 04:52.540* :  She is sick in health
*04:52.600- 04:54.420* :  at a mid-Sasan frontier clinic
*04:54.420- 04:55.880* :  at the Adre refugee camp,
*04:56.420- 04:58.080* :  just over the border in neighboring Chad.
*04:59.900- 05:00.860* :  The militia caught me,
*05:00.860- 05:02.240* :  along with my aunts and cousins.
*05:02.940- 05:03.400* :  They escaped,
*05:03.420- 05:05.500* :  but I was kept for a whole day,
*05:06.020- 05:07.420* :  one raped me many times
*05:07.420- 05:09.040* :  before I managed to escape.
*05:13.860- 05:15.820* :  Sexual violence is a huge problem,
*05:15.820- 05:17.380* :  but official figures are low
*05:17.540- 05:19.000* :  because many women and girls
*05:19.080- 05:21.360* :  do not speak out for fear of victimization.
*05:22.220- 05:22.720* :  In response,
*05:23.140- 05:24.780* :  many voluntary groups have sprung up
*05:24.780- 05:25.760* :  in the refugee camps
*05:25.760- 05:27.740* :  supporting the women who have been affected.
*05:30.840- 05:31.720* :  It is mid-day.
*05:32.640- 05:33.520* :  In a makeshift heart,
*05:33.520- 05:34.860* :  just outside the camp,
*05:34.860- 05:37.440* :  a group of about 30 women and girls
*05:38.760- 05:40.840* :  are trained with tiny caps of tea
*05:40.840- 05:42.580* :  and coffee is passed around.
*05:43.180- 05:44.640* :  There are some dried dates,
*05:45.020- 05:45.700* :  dried fruit,
*05:46.140- 05:47.180* :  in that too.
*05:47.900- 05:49.320* :  Zahra, a social worker
*05:49.320- 05:50.600* :  in a refugee from Sudan,
*05:51.080- 05:53.260* :  brings women who have been abused together.
*05:54.300- 05:56.840* :  The women have gone through many difficulties.
*05:57.960- 05:59.240* :  They lost everything they have
*05:59.520- 06:01.360* :  and some also wanted to kill themselves,
*06:02.200- 06:03.200* :  so it is very difficult.
*06:04.140- 06:05.380* :  But we try and help them,
*06:05.720- 06:07.140* :  giving them psychological support.
*06:08.940- 06:10.500* :  As the women share their experiences
*06:10.500- 06:12.540* :  of both physical and sexual violence,
*06:13.340- 06:15.280* :  tears flow freely in the room.
*06:16.560- 06:18.200* :  Mariamu, not her real name,
*06:18.920- 06:22.060* :  sobs so hard as she recounts to us her ideal.
*06:22.920- 06:25.400* :  Before the war, she studied accounting of university.
*06:25.860- 06:27.960* :  She was attacked and wrapped by armed men
*06:27.960- 06:29.080* :  in her home in Sudan.
*06:29.840- 06:30.840* :  When she called for help,
*06:31.180- 06:32.080* :  they fired a bullet
*06:32.280- 06:33.440* :  inches away from her mother
*06:33.440- 06:35.320* :  as she tried to come into the room
*06:35.320- 06:36.680* :  to stop what was happening.
*06:37.180- 06:39.380* :  After that, I could not walk.
*06:39.960- 06:41.340* :  My mom took some stuff from the house
*06:41.340- 06:42.600* :  and we left with my grandmother.
*06:43.120- 06:44.120* :  People were running,
*06:44.120- 06:44.780* :  but we could not,
*06:44.780- 06:46.200* :  because my grandmother cannot run.
*06:46.740- 06:47.620* :  I was also bleeding.
*06:48.560- 06:49.340* :  We managed to flee,
*06:49.340- 06:50.500* :  but I'm not feeling okay.
*06:51.100- 06:51.680* :  I'm not happy.
*06:52.420- 06:53.540* :  I'm really traumatized.
*06:54.060- 06:54.640* :  They are doing that,
*06:54.640- 06:57.240* :  because they are trying to spoil our dignity,
*06:57.660- 06:59.320* :  because they are taking us as their enemies.
*07:00.120- 07:00.740* :  Many times,
*07:00.740- 07:02.980* :  Mariamu has wished she was dead.
*07:03.480- 07:04.620* :  It is in gatherings,
*07:04.620- 07:07.040* :  like these ones that she gets some solace,
*07:07.380- 07:09.300* :  and is reminded that she is not alone.
*07:10.380- 07:12.000* :  For days and days,
*07:12.060- 07:13.140* :  I've been seeing to myself,
*07:13.140- 07:14.260* :  why am I living?
*07:14.900- 07:15.560* :  Why am I living?
*07:16.380- 07:17.960* :  But Zahara talks to me and says,
*07:18.280- 07:20.160* :  what happened to you happened to a lot of people?
*07:20.540- 07:21.920* :  You must be strong and positive.
*07:22.600- 07:24.740* :  While attacks on women have been carried out
*07:24.780- 07:25.880* :  by the Sudanese army,
*07:26.260- 07:28.900* :  the UN says over 80% have been committed
*07:28.900- 07:31.220* :  by the rapid support forces and its allies.
*07:32.020- 07:33.640* :  One prominent RSF member
*07:33.640- 07:35.760* :  revealed his attitude towards women
*07:35.760- 07:38.100* :  in a video posted on social media,
*07:38.660- 07:38.940* :  saying,
*07:39.360- 07:41.020* :  if we rape your daughter or your girl,
*07:41.020- 07:42.340* :  it's an eye for an eye.
*07:42.820- 07:43.660* :  This is our country,
*07:44.100- 07:45.700* :  and this is our right, and we took it.
*07:46.440- 07:48.040* :  20 years ago, the UN says
*07:48.040- 07:51.380* :  300,000 members of the Black African community
*07:51.380- 07:53.140* :  were killed in the Darfur region,
*07:53.640- 07:55.380* :  amidst accusations of genocide.
*07:56.600- 07:57.400* :  Zahara says,
*07:57.600- 07:59.160* :  Black African women are being targeted
*07:59.160- 08:00.440* :  in the current conflict.
*08:00.580- 08:02.120* :  This is revenge,
*08:03.140- 08:04.220* :  because the Arab militias
*08:04.220- 08:05.820* :  targeted a particular group,
*08:06.460- 08:07.040* :  the massletes,
*08:07.180- 08:08.800* :  because of a history of old problems.
*08:09.560- 08:10.800* :  They are doing this to the women
*08:10.800- 08:12.300* :  because rape leaves an impact
*08:12.300- 08:14.280* :  on society and the family.
*08:15.060- 08:16.900* :  The rapid support forces told us
*08:16.940- 08:18.400* :  the majority of accusations
*08:18.400- 08:20.220* :  against these are untrue,
*08:20.680- 08:22.420* :  but its troops are held accountable
*08:22.420- 08:23.680* :  when incidents occur.
*08:24.520- 08:26.320* :  Ordinary women are paying the price
*08:26.320- 08:27.180* :  for the brutality
*08:27.180- 08:29.320* :  which has been unleashed by the conflict in Sudan.
*08:30.020- 08:31.480* :  With no end inside,
*08:31.800- 08:33.100* :  there could be many women
*08:33.100- 08:34.460* :  suffering in silence.
*08:35.320- 08:36.980* :  That report by Mercy Jumma
*08:37.040- 08:38.640* :  on the Chad Sudan border.
*08:40.060- 08:41.600* :  It's a centerpiece of China's
*08:41.600- 08:44.000* :  multi-billion dollar investment in Pakistan,
*08:44.000- 08:46.680* :  but on Wednesday, the deep sea port of Guadal
*08:47.040- 08:49.100* :  in the southwestern province of Baluchistan
*08:49.100- 08:50.840* :  was stormed by militants
*08:50.860- 08:52.000* :  who attacked with grenades,
*08:52.000- 08:53.220* :  rocket launchers,
*08:53.340- 08:54.360* :  and Kalashnikovs,
*08:54.760- 08:55.760* :  according to the authorities.
*08:56.220- 08:58.160* :  Security forces at the Port Complex
*08:58.160- 08:58.860* :  fought back,
*08:59.660- 09:01.040* :  reportedly killing eight government,
*09:01.580- 09:02.880* :  a Baluch separatist group
*09:02.920- 09:04.240* :  said it carried out the attack.
*09:04.500- 09:05.260* :  We've got more details
*09:05.260- 09:06.860* :  from our Pakistan correspondent,
*09:06.940- 09:07.920* :  Caroline Davis.
*09:08.620- 09:09.820* :  We are getting most of our information
*09:09.920- 09:11.880* :  from the officials on the ground
*09:12.040- 09:13.040* :  in Baluchistan.
*09:13.240- 09:14.180* :  Now, according to them,
*09:14.660- 09:18.300* :  some armed militants arrived at the Port of Guadal
*09:18.960- 09:20.160* :  with guns, with bombs.
*09:20.320- 09:21.340* :  They stormed the complex,
*09:21.460- 09:23.060* :  and it seems that they have targeted
*09:23.060- 09:25.580* :  the area just outside the port,
*09:25.580- 09:27.900* :  which is where the government departments are based,
*09:27.920- 09:29.920* :  including intelligence agencies
*09:30.180- 09:31.920* :  and paramilitary forces as well.
*09:32.420- 09:34.820* :  And according to the government officials,
*09:35.360- 09:37.220* :  they detonated a number of bombs.
*09:37.280- 09:39.840* :  We've also heard from several sources
*09:40.080- 09:40.940* :  that were close on the ground
*09:40.940- 09:42.240* :  that said that they heard explosions.
*09:42.980- 09:45.540* :  And then they began shooting as well.
*09:45.540- 09:48.000* :  Now, according to the government officials,
*09:48.000- 09:49.980* :  they say that eight militants
*09:50.640- 09:52.040* :  were killed during the process
*09:52.040- 09:53.920* :  of trying to stop this attack.
*09:54.360- 09:55.680* :  We've also heard that there were
*09:56.320- 09:58.240* :  at least one soldier,
*09:58.240- 09:59.180* :  a Pakistani soldier,
*09:59.180- 10:02.400* :  that was killed while trying to defend this area as well.
*10:02.400- 10:04.180* :  But it's possible that there might be more.
*10:04.180- 10:05.640* :  We're still waiting for further details
*10:06.220- 10:07.100* :  about the exact number.
*10:07.280- 10:09.760* :  And it's believed that separatists
*10:10.180- 10:11.600* :  are behind the attack.
*10:11.600- 10:13.140* :  In fact, I think there's been a claim
*10:13.540- 10:14.520* :  by the separatist group,
*10:14.660- 10:16.460* :  the Baluch Liberation Army.
*10:17.320- 10:19.360* :  Yes. So the Baluch Liberation Army have claimed
*10:19.360- 10:20.540* :  that this is one of the most prominent
*10:21.020- 10:23.100* :  of these separatist groups in Baluchistan.
*10:23.340- 10:25.260* :  Now, the area that this is in
*10:25.260- 10:26.380* :  is particularly important.
*10:26.380- 10:28.780* :  This is a deep sea port, the port of Guadal,
*10:29.120- 10:30.080* :  on the Arabian Sea.
*10:30.160- 10:31.820* :  It is thought of as the gateway
*10:31.820- 10:34.020* :  to the China-Pakistan economic corridor,
*10:34.020- 10:37.200* :  or part of China's Belt and Road infrastructure project.
*10:37.200- 10:39.300* :  And China has poured large amounts of money
*10:39.780- 10:40.500* :  into Pakistan,
*10:40.960- 10:42.180* :  particularly in this area,
*10:42.180- 10:43.460* :  in the province of Baluchistan,
*10:44.040- 10:46.040* :  despite the fact that there has been decades
*10:46.040- 10:49.080* :  long separatist insurgency in the area.
*10:49.620- 10:52.060* :  The Baluch nationals wanting to have
*10:52.500- 10:53.840* :  either sort of independence,
*10:53.840- 10:55.800* :  separate state, just more autonomy
*10:55.800- 10:58.500* :  over what happens inside Baluchistan.
*10:59.380- 11:00.800* :  And so that has always been ongoing.
*11:00.800- 11:02.980* :  And now there is a large amount of Chinese investment
*11:02.980- 11:05.040* :  over the course of their last few years.
*11:05.200- 11:07.920* :  There have been attacks by the BLA,
*11:07.920- 11:09.420* :  by the Baluch Liberation Army,
*11:09.880- 11:11.900* :  on both Chinese interests
*11:11.920- 11:14.360* :  and also Pakistani interests in the region.
*11:14.820- 11:16.140* :  According to the BLA,
*11:16.140- 11:17.640* :  they say that the reason they did this,
*11:17.640- 11:18.760* :  they were attacking the Pakistan
*11:19.620- 11:21.040* :  intelligence agencies' offices.
*11:21.580- 11:22.180* :  And in particular,
*11:22.180- 11:23.500* :  a lot of these separatist groups
*11:23.540- 11:25.420* :  are trying to fight, they say,
*11:25.420- 11:27.500* :  for a larger share in the wealth,
*11:27.540- 11:28.860* :  for the minds, the minerals,
*11:29.720- 11:31.340* :  that are mined in this area
*11:31.340- 11:33.300* :  that they want to have more of that money
*11:33.300- 11:34.940* :  coming back into the region.
*11:35.600- 11:36.860* :  Caroline Davis in Pakistan.
*11:37.760- 11:39.780* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*11:39.780- 11:42.340* :  says he has approved the operational plans
*11:42.440- 11:45.960* :  for a ground offensive in the city of Rafa in southern Gaza.
*11:46.680- 11:48.540* :  This is despite President Biden
*11:49.380- 11:50.580* :  repeatedly urging Israel
*11:50.580- 11:52.640* :  to call off an assault on the area
*11:52.980- 11:56.280* :  where one and a half million Palestinians are sheltering.
*11:56.680- 11:59.800* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Mark Lohan, told us more.
*12:00.100- 12:02.700* :  It's a credible plan from the Israelis
*12:02.700- 12:04.560* :  about the evacuation of the civilians.
*12:04.620- 12:06.160* :  There are about one and a half million
*12:07.080- 12:08.880* :  thought to be sheltering in Rafa,
*12:08.880- 12:11.440* :  more than half of the entire population of Gaza.
*12:11.640- 12:13.660* :  And that is why there are these dire warnings
*12:13.660- 12:14.780* :  of what could happen
*12:14.780- 12:17.860* :  if the Israeli military does indeed go into Rafa.
*12:17.860- 12:19.560* :  And today Benjamin Netanyahu said he had
*12:19.940- 12:23.380* :  approved the operational plans for the incursion into Rafa
*12:23.720- 12:26.640* :  and that soon he would approve the evacuation plans.
*12:26.680- 12:28.260* :  But he said it would take some time
*12:28.260- 12:30.240* :  for the incursion to begin
*12:30.240- 12:32.980* :  because of course the evacuation would have to go first.
*12:33.300- 12:35.520* :  Now this is all very much at the center
*12:35.520- 12:37.160* :  of the acrimonialist relationship at the moment
*12:37.160- 12:39.800* :  and increasingly so between the Israeli government
*12:39.800- 12:41.360* :  and the Biden administration.
*12:41.780- 12:43.620* :  The two leaders spoke a couple of days ago
*12:43.620- 12:44.860* :  for the first time in more than a month.
*12:44.860- 12:46.100* :  And President Biden said that
*12:46.120- 12:48.600* :  a told Benjamin Netanyahu that the incursion into Rafa
*12:48.600- 12:49.560* :  would be a mistake.
*12:49.580- 12:52.440* :  Now it's likely to be at the center of talks also on Friday
*12:52.440- 12:54.280* :  when Anthony Blinken, the US Secretary of State,
*12:54.280- 12:57.460* :  comes to Israel on a previously unscheduled leg
*12:57.460- 12:58.700* :  of his Middle East tour.
*12:59.180- 13:00.920* :  Was that a snub to Israel?
*13:00.920- 13:02.580* :  We don't know, but I mean that clearly
*13:02.580- 13:05.620* :  the two governments are at loggerheads over Rafa
*13:05.620- 13:07.200* :  and on several other parts of the war
*13:07.540- 13:10.740* :  and they will discuss it all on Friday during those talks.
*13:11.360- 13:14.540* :  Mark Lowen French regulators say they will find Google
*13:14.540- 13:18.540* :  more than $270 million for violating
*13:18.540- 13:20.320* :  intellectual property rules.
*13:20.860- 13:23.220* :  This concerns breaches of compensation agreements
*13:23.220- 13:26.240* :  made to news publishers for reproducing their content.
*13:26.700- 13:27.920* :  Alice Adley reports.
*13:28.060- 13:31.300* :  France's competition authority said Google failed
*13:31.300- 13:33.820* :  to respect commitments made three years ago
*13:34.100- 13:36.820* :  to negotiate fairly with French news organizations
*13:36.820- 13:40.160* :  on how much to compensate them for using their content.
*13:40.220- 13:43.440* :  The regulator also found that Google used material
*13:43.440- 13:47.140* :  to train its AI chatbot Bard since renamed Gemini
*13:47.560- 13:48.960* :  without notifying the publishers.
*13:49.580- 13:51.640* :  Google says the fine is disproportionate.
*13:52.020- 13:54.260* :  Google and other tech giants have been accused
*13:54.260- 13:55.820* :  of making billions from news
*13:56.220- 13:58.940* :  without sharing the revenue with the people who gather it.
*13:59.420- 14:00.080* :  Alice Adley.
*14:00.860- 14:03.080* :  The Spanish Football Federation is in the news,
*14:03.080- 14:05.540* :  but yet again it's for all the wrong reasons.
*14:05.620- 14:07.900* :  Its headquarters in Madrid have been rated
*14:07.900- 14:10.220* :  by police as part of a corruption investigation.
*14:10.800- 14:12.680* :  Not only that, but the home of the Federation's
*14:12.680- 14:15.280* :  former president Luis Rubiales was also searched
*14:15.600- 14:17.060* :  along with a number of other locations.
*14:17.180- 14:19.940* :  Several people have reportedly been arrested.
*14:20.400- 14:23.600* :  Amidrid Correspondent Guy Hegeco told us more about the rates.
*14:24.120- 14:26.580* :  What we know is that these rates were all linked
*14:26.580- 14:28.880* :  to an investigation that is taking place
*14:28.880- 14:31.160* :  into contracts that were signed
*14:31.580- 14:34.000* :  between the Football Federation several years ago
*14:34.460- 14:36.260* :  and a company called Cosmos,
*14:36.300- 14:40.940* :  which is owned by a former Spanish international player
*14:41.420- 14:43.820* :  Gerard Piquet and those contracts
*14:43.820- 14:47.980* :  they sought to move the Super Cup football competition
*14:48.020- 14:52.120* :  from Spain to be played in Saudi Arabia.
*14:52.820- 14:55.860* :  And the authorities believe that there was some kind of wrong
*14:55.860- 14:58.100* :  doing linked to those contracts
*14:58.740- 15:01.280* :  and they are investigating these contracts
*15:01.280- 15:04.280* :  for money laundering and corruption.
*15:04.880- 15:08.800* :  And it's interesting that the home of Luis Rubiales
*15:08.800- 15:10.800* :  has been rated because he was caught up
*15:10.800- 15:12.840* :  in another scandal last year.
*15:13.540- 15:18.600* :  Yes, in August last year, just after Spain won
*15:18.600- 15:21.740* :  the women's World Cup final down in Australia.
*15:21.740- 15:24.880* :  The women's team was celebrating their World Cup win
*15:25.440- 15:28.340* :  and to celebrate Mr. Rubiales kissed one of the players
*15:28.340- 15:30.480* :  on the lips, Jenny Edmosa.
*15:31.000- 15:33.840* :  That triggered a massive backlash here in Spain
*15:34.480- 15:37.460* :  which led to Mr. Rubiales losing his job
*15:37.980- 15:41.380* :  and it also led to him being investigated for sexual assault
*15:41.460- 15:44.560* :  and he's going to go on trial for sexual assault
*15:45.100- 15:47.500* :  because of the kiss that he gave Jenny Edmosa.
*15:47.940- 15:51.640* :  So I think the fact that he is linked to this investigation
*15:51.880- 15:56.640* :  only adds to his status as a very controversial figure
*15:56.640- 15:57.600* :  in Spanish sport.
*15:58.500- 15:59.060* :  Hi, Hitchcock.
*15:59.820- 16:03.280* :  Now to a lakeside villa which is on sale for $90 million
*16:03.340- 16:06.320* :  but with no bidders, the villa is in Myanmar
*16:06.320- 16:08.960* :  and it's where the detained pro-democracy leader,
*16:08.960- 16:12.600* :  Ang San Suu Chi, lived and campaigned for many years
*16:13.220- 16:15.300* :  including 15 years while under house arrest.
*16:15.960- 16:18.560* :  Jonathan Head is a BBC Southeast Asia correspondent.
*16:18.620- 16:22.580* :  He told Nulema Goven more about the house's long history.
*16:23.260- 16:27.280* :  It's known to everybody in Myanmar's number 54 university avenue
*16:27.800- 16:32.920* :  because it is the place from which Ang San Suu Chi ran her campaign
*16:32.920- 16:35.720* :  for democracy over many, many years,
*16:36.120- 16:38.720* :  largely because she was confined for 15 years
*16:39.440- 16:41.540* :  under house arrest there couldn't leave,
*16:41.560- 16:44.220* :  let a very quiet and isolated existence
*16:44.780- 16:47.920* :  and then in the brief periods when they did allow her freedom
*16:47.980- 16:53.320* :  she would then give speeches from the front gate people would come and fill the road up.
*16:53.780- 16:55.700* :  It's very much associated with her.
*16:55.920- 16:59.260* :  The house itself, it's a rather grand colonial villa,
*16:59.420- 17:03.120* :  was given to Ang San Suu Chi's mother back in 1953.
*17:03.800- 17:05.600* :  The family had had a pretty traumatic time
*17:05.600- 17:07.660* :  because of course Ang San Suu Chi's father,
*17:07.660- 17:10.000* :  the founding father of the independence movement,
*17:10.000- 17:13.640* :  was assassinated when she was only two years old in 1947
*17:14.340- 17:15.960* :  just before the country became independent.
*17:15.960- 17:17.500* :  He was set to be its first leader.
*17:18.140- 17:22.760* :  And then in 1952 her older brother drowned in a swimming pool
*17:22.760- 17:26.180* :  in their then house in another part of what was then Rangoon.
*17:26.780- 17:29.980* :  And so in 1953 the government donated this villa in the land
*17:29.980- 17:33.000* :  by the lake to her mother who was a highly respected figure.
*17:33.000- 17:34.720* :  She went on to be an ambassador to India.
*17:35.060- 17:38.520* :  And Ang San Suu Chi and her surviving brother grew up there,
*17:38.520- 17:40.640* :  although Ang San Suu Chi spent quite a lot of time overseas.
*17:41.380- 17:46.240* :  In fact she was out of the country through this 1960s and 70s studying,
*17:46.900- 17:48.360* :  getting work experience, getting married.
*17:48.360- 17:50.680* :  She married of course the British academic Michael Ares.
*17:51.340- 17:54.620* :  And she used to go back for visits but she didn't end up living back there
*17:55.060- 17:58.680* :  until the fateful return in 1988 when she came back
*17:59.100- 18:01.920* :  to look after her mother who was ailing and would die that year
*18:02.500- 18:06.780* :  and got caught up in the the first big anti-military movement.
*18:06.900- 18:10.340* :  A huge uprising in the military that was put down very savagely
*18:10.340- 18:13.320* :  and she found herself leading because of her famous provenance.
*18:13.320- 18:17.780* :  Her father leading this movement and founded the National League for theocracy
*18:17.780- 18:20.280* :  of Party and ran it from her house as well.
*18:20.560- 18:22.740* :  So the house is totally wrapped up with her
*18:23.260- 18:26.760* :  and with the history of Myanmar's struggle for democracy.
*18:27.280- 18:29.840* :  A very powerful symbol and indeed that's why
*18:29.840- 18:32.120* :  many of Ang San Suu Chi supporters believe
*18:32.140- 18:36.160* :  that these constant attempts have been made by her estranged brother
*18:36.160- 18:39.700* :  of they believe with military backing to try to take the house from her.
*18:40.020- 18:44.940* :  And to sell it so it went on auction but nobody has bid for it
*18:44.940- 18:47.740* :  but I couldn't believe the price, 90 million dollars.
*18:48.380- 18:50.500* :  90 million most people think it's an absurd price,
*18:51.060- 18:53.320* :  particularly now the country mired in civil war,
*18:53.320- 18:58.680* :  it's economy and here collapse, no one would pay that price rationally for that land.
*18:59.540- 19:01.740* :  So you kind of wonder what's going on here
*19:01.740- 19:04.240* :  because the auction itself was also rather
*19:04.960- 19:08.360* :  shotally organized, the court officials who'd ordered its sale
*19:08.820- 19:10.820* :  just showed up in front of the house this morning
*19:10.820- 19:13.680* :  and in front of the small gathering of journalists,
*19:13.680- 19:14.980* :  there aren't many journalists left in Myanmar,
*19:15.480- 19:17.140* :  they basically just did right,
*19:17.640- 19:19.660* :  anyone bid 90 million dollars for this house,
*19:19.660- 19:21.980* :  they did it three times, they banged a little gong
*19:22.340- 19:24.080* :  and they said right no bids were postponing it.
*19:24.080- 19:26.280* :  It's almost as if they weren't really trying to do it
*19:26.600- 19:28.400* :  because it's fiercely opposed the sale of the house.
*19:28.400- 19:29.740* :  A lot of people are angry about it.
*19:30.140- 19:32.680* :  The movement that represents the ousted government
*19:32.680- 19:34.860* :  that Anson Suchi led, the national unity government
*19:34.860- 19:36.580* :  that's been fighting the military
*19:36.980- 19:38.960* :  has declared it a historic monument
*19:38.960- 19:41.640* :  and says that any forced sale will be illegal.
*19:42.080- 19:45.100* :  And remember that the country is in such a fibrous state at the moment,
*19:45.100- 19:47.180* :  there have been a number of bomb attacks in Yangon,
*19:47.180- 19:50.520* :  there are movements fighting the military all across the country.
*19:50.920- 19:53.640* :  So anybody who buys it might find themselves being targeted
*19:54.220- 19:55.820* :  by anti-military campaigners as well,
*19:55.820- 19:57.540* :  which might have been a strong disincentive
*19:57.880- 19:59.500* :  to show up and start bidding for it,
*19:59.500- 20:01.380* :  even if you wanted to pay that much money for it.
*20:01.720- 20:02.240* :  Jonathan Head.
*20:05.020- 20:05.640* :  Still to come.
*20:05.980- 20:07.500* :  I just thought I'd order eight Easter eggs
*20:07.620- 20:10.200* :  and then the lorry falls up and we have a lorry full of Easter eggs
*20:10.460- 20:12.280* :  and yeah, I felt pretty stupid pretty quickly.
*20:13.220- 20:16.580* :  So what does a shopkeeper on a small Scottish island do
*20:17.100- 20:19.520* :  when he has more Easter eggs in stock
*20:19.960- 20:21.260* :  than the number of residents?

*22:40.640- 22:42.340* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*22:43.160- 22:47.320* :  Senegal is finally holding presidential elections this coming Sunday.
*22:47.320- 22:50.960* :  They were initially scheduled for the 25th of February,
*22:51.420- 22:54.600* :  but President Mackie Sal tried to postpone them indefinitely.
*22:55.040- 22:56.900* :  That attempt ended in failure,
*22:57.100- 22:59.420* :  sparking some of the most violent protests
*23:00.040- 23:03.520* :  that this relatively stable nation has seen in recent times.
*23:04.260- 23:06.560* :  President Sal has been speaking to our colleague,
*23:06.560- 23:10.200* :  Waihiga Moewa, who asked him if he wanted to apologise
*23:10.200- 23:12.660* :  for the chaos he caused back in February
*23:13.020- 23:14.300* :  by postponing the elections.
*23:17.080- 23:18.180* :  I don't have to apologise,
*23:18.660- 23:20.520* :  because I didn't do anything wrong.
*23:22.480- 23:24.100* :  Do you pledge to the people of Senegal
*23:24.100- 23:25.520* :  that on the 2nd of April,
*23:25.920- 23:29.100* :  as head of state you will step away from office, you will retire?
*23:29.580- 23:29.980* :  Of course.
*23:32.020- 23:33.560* :  On April 2nd, I'm leaving,
*23:34.020- 23:35.700* :  because that is the end of my mandate,
*23:35.700- 23:37.680* :  and I do not intend to stay.
*23:38.320- 23:40.560* :  I hope that all this will go well,
*23:41.040- 23:44.340* :  and that the president's elect will take office to continue the work
*23:44.680- 23:46.240* :  that was done by his predecessors.
*23:47.200- 23:49.400* :  What's your message to Opposition candidate,
*23:49.400- 23:53.620* :  some of whom feel that you have curtailed their campaigns?
*23:53.620- 23:54.380* :  Now, I'll give you an example.
*23:54.380- 23:57.760* :  When you are trying to unseat the former president Abdullah Awad,
*23:58.280- 23:59.640* :  you had the room to campaign.
*23:59.640- 24:03.040* :  You had the room to compete then as a candidate, Mr. President.
*24:03.700- 24:05.100* :  But your political opponents,
*24:05.100- 24:06.960* :  at least three that I can mention,
*24:06.960- 24:10.380* :  haven't seemed to enjoy the same rights over the last four years.
*24:10.800- 24:12.960* :  I'm not also talking about Halifa Sal,
*24:13.340- 24:15.960* :  who looked quite strong also about four years ago,
*24:15.960- 24:18.200* :  and then faced a slew of legal wars.
*24:18.220- 24:22.800* :  Is it coincidental that when a politician challenges Makisal,
*24:23.240- 24:25.560* :  that suddenly they get into trouble with the law?
*24:30.140- 24:32.280* :  They are not in competition with me.
*24:32.940- 24:35.260* :  For a very long time, at least since July,
*24:35.640- 24:37.440* :  I was not a candidate for another term.
*24:38.120- 24:40.460* :  Nevertheless, it is not because you were a politician
*24:40.500- 24:43.660* :  that you should not answer for your actions before the law.
*24:47.260- 24:48.620* :  If they had followed me,
*24:48.620- 24:51.760* :  there would have been a process where all the actors were candidates.
*24:52.520- 24:54.340* :  If we had postponed the elections to June,
*24:54.420- 24:57.160* :  we would have had the possibility of having an embassy,
*24:57.800- 25:00.220* :  which would have given them back a certain number of rights,
*25:01.020- 25:02.860* :  so that Sonko would have been a candidate.
*25:03.480- 25:05.180* :  Curry Mwart would have been a candidate,
*25:05.720- 25:06.640* :  as well as all the others,
*25:07.200- 25:09.780* :  so if we didn't have the time we needed to campaign,
*25:10.420- 25:11.220* :  it's not my fault.
*25:13.860- 25:16.520* :  When you look at the headlines in different media outlets
*25:16.520- 25:19.140* :  over the last three or four months regarding Sanago,
*25:19.720- 25:21.580* :  it's been about this beacon of democracy,
*25:21.580- 25:26.640* :  this real pillar in the region that seems to have degenerated,
*25:26.640- 25:30.360* :  that looked quite fragile as compared to how it was viewed
*25:30.360- 25:33.980* :  before when you take personal responsibility as the head of state
*25:34.620- 25:37.380* :  for what we've seen coming out of this region and out of this country
*25:37.800- 25:38.700* :  over the last three months.
*25:40.620- 25:44.940* :  We still have to put into perspective the judgments we make about Sanago,
*25:45.380- 25:47.240* :  its democracy and its president.
*25:48.020- 25:49.040* :  In the progress of states,
*25:49.040- 25:51.500* :  there comes times where there are crises,
*25:52.120- 25:54.800* :  and it is these crises which strengthen democracy.
*25:55.480- 25:59.820* :  And I think that this crisis has shown that we have solid institutions
*26:00.380- 26:03.420* :  and more than ever, our democracy is set in stone.
*26:07.660- 26:09.300* :  President Mackie Sal of Senegal,
*26:09.960- 26:11.520* :  the former international footballer,
*26:11.520- 26:14.380* :  Rabinho has been told by a court in his native Brazil
*26:14.380- 26:17.980* :  that he will go to prison there to serve a nine-year sentence for rape.
*26:18.500- 26:20.380* :  The sentence was imposed in Italy,
*26:20.380- 26:24.860* :  where Rabinho had been convicted for the gang rape of an Albanian woman.
*26:25.360- 26:27.180* :  But after failing to get him extradited,
*26:27.540- 26:30.320* :  Isli had asked that he serve his time in Brazil.
*26:30.920- 26:33.080* :  Our America's regional editor, Leonardo Russia,
*26:33.480- 26:34.620* :  told us more about the case.
*26:35.200- 26:36.980* :  What happened in 2013,
*26:36.980- 26:40.080* :  Rabinho at that time was a big international star.
*26:40.600- 26:43.120* :  He was a big Brazilian football team star,
*26:43.120- 26:45.700* :  had played for months in the city and was playing for Milan,
*26:45.960- 26:46.940* :  for AC Milan.
*26:47.660- 26:52.120* :  And this girl went to a VIP area in a nightclub
*26:52.720- 26:56.740* :  and she was basically encircled by Rabinho and five of his friends.
*26:57.420- 26:58.980* :  Enraped several times.
*26:59.500- 27:03.460* :  He lost the first trial in 2017, appealed.
*27:04.340- 27:08.900* :  And eventually he left Italy before the final appealed,
*27:08.900- 27:11.640* :  knowing fully aware that the Brazilian Constitution
*27:11.700- 27:14.420* :  bans the extradition of any of its nationals,
*27:14.460- 27:16.420* :  unless it's for drug trafficking of fences.
*27:17.000- 27:19.320* :  And the interesting thing, the sad thing is that
*27:19.820- 27:22.680* :  four of his friends left the country immediately.
*27:22.680- 27:25.360* :  They were never served and they were never tried.
*27:25.860- 27:31.360* :  And his other friends were tried but left Italy before the sentence
*27:32.000- 27:34.540* :  came for final conviction when they haven't served
*27:34.540- 27:36.240* :  any time in prison so far.
*27:36.560- 27:38.280* :  So a lot of people are very angry about that,
*27:38.340- 27:40.900* :  but there's also been a lot of outrage over the details
*27:40.900- 27:42.280* :  that have emerged of this case.
*27:42.540- 27:47.440* :  Yes, because the audios of Rabinho and his friends
*27:48.060- 27:50.180* :  discussing joking about this case,
*27:50.180- 27:54.340* :  awful comments saying, for example, that she was an Albanese migrant,
*27:54.340- 27:57.460* :  no one would believe that she was too drunk and she wouldn't be credible.
*27:57.980- 28:00.900* :  All that was released in Brazilian media last year.
*28:01.320- 28:02.840* :  And it caused a complete outrage.
*28:03.360- 28:06.780* :  And I think that's why the court, the high court in Brazilian
*28:07.220- 28:10.760* :  decided to take this decision, which is quite unusual
*28:11.320- 28:14.440* :  to get him to serve his prison sentence in Brazil.
*28:14.440- 28:18.260* :  And they also ruled that he will have to serve it behind bars.
*28:18.260- 28:22.320* :  It was a debate whether it's going to be a house arrest or not.
*28:22.480- 28:23.580* :  But he could still appeal.
*28:24.100- 28:25.860* :  He can appeal to the Supreme Court,
*28:26.440- 28:30.220* :  but I would say that from what I heard in the trial,
*28:30.700- 28:33.020* :  it has very little chance of getting, we don't know,
*28:33.020- 28:35.940* :  but we have little chance of getting that successful
*28:35.940- 28:38.000* :  because there's an outrage in the country
*28:38.380- 28:40.980* :  and the judges said that the evidence is quite overwhelming
*28:40.980- 28:45.060* :  and it comes from Italy where the justice system is quite reliable.
*28:45.580- 28:46.260* :  Leonardo Rossa.
*28:46.980- 28:48.880* :  Now, you may have come across a teenage craze
*28:48.880- 28:51.140* :  for using strong anti-aging products,
*28:51.140- 28:53.680* :  possibly by following so-called skin influences
*28:53.680- 28:55.180* :  on social media platforms.
*28:55.820- 28:59.680* :  Creams, serums, and face masks are all over TikTok or Instagram.
*29:00.200- 29:03.240* :  But after seeing an increase in children using such products,
*29:03.900- 29:07.020* :  Swedish pharmacies have announced they're imposing an age limit
*29:07.020- 29:08.460* :  of 18 years.
*29:09.340- 29:11.360* :  Stephanie Zacharyson reports,
*29:12.180- 29:15.020* :  You may have heard of retinal, a type of vitamin A,
*29:15.420- 29:17.880* :  or salicylic acid, enthine peeling,
*29:18.320- 29:20.000* :  or other types of skin care products
*29:20.000- 29:23.540* :  that have become increasingly popular in the last couple of years.
*29:24.200- 29:26.260* :  They're all promising younger-looking skin,
*29:26.260- 29:29.420* :  clearer, plumper, smoother, with fewer wrinkles,
*29:30.300- 29:33.100* :  but they have been warnings that more and more young people
*29:33.100- 29:34.560* :  are using such products,
*29:35.400- 29:38.800* :  despite them potentially being way too strong for their skin.
*29:39.460- 29:42.980* :  These teenagers told the BBC what they thought about it.
*29:43.100- 29:47.000* :  First, I'll go with the cleanser and then I do a serum next.
*29:47.260- 29:49.340* :  Yes, I do think there's a problem with
*29:49.860- 29:52.280* :  young people using older skin care products.
*29:52.740- 29:55.640* :  I know skin care, there's quite a few acids
*29:55.640- 29:57.500* :  that aren't really good for young people.
*29:57.860- 30:02.080* :  I found out about them from TikTok and that type of stuff.
*30:02.800- 30:04.600* :  A leading pharmacy chain in Sweden,
*30:04.600- 30:08.480* :  Apothea Ketjata, has decided to implement an age limit
*30:08.480- 30:11.500* :  on what they're calling advanced skin care products.
*30:11.500- 30:14.260* :  Younger people will still be able to buy them
*30:14.260- 30:16.540* :  if, for example, they have a medical reason
*30:16.960- 30:18.920* :  or if a parent comes with them to the shop.
*30:19.420- 30:21.700* :  Their head pharmacist, Annika Sviadboe,
*30:21.940- 30:25.040* :  told Swedish Radio why they were introducing restrictions.
*30:25.640- 30:27.300* :  These from Serliom have reductena.
*30:27.460- 30:30.340* :  Everyone selling these products should take responsibility,
*30:30.460- 30:33.320* :  so we're hoping that we're just a first of many companies
*30:33.320- 30:35.460* :  and that others will follow our lead.
*30:35.700- 30:39.540* :  Last year, the EU imposed limits on the strength of some ingredients
*30:39.540- 30:42.360* :  such as retinal in over-the-counter products.
*30:43.100- 30:46.000* :  And recently, the British Association for Dermatologists
*30:46.540- 30:49.400* :  warned that using certain products could leave children
*30:49.400- 30:50.420* :  with skin problems.
*30:51.160- 30:55.020* :  In Sweden, another pharmacy also said they would now add an age limit
*30:55.640- 30:58.180* :  and some cosmetic stores are considering similar rules.
*30:58.840- 31:01.940* :  One of them said they'd had children as young as seven coming in,
*31:02.320- 31:05.860* :  asking to buy skincare products with anti-aging properties.
*31:06.600- 31:08.040* :  Stephanie Zachristen.
*31:08.660- 31:12.120* :  Finally to Scotland, where a mix-up with an order has left a shop owner
*31:12.120- 31:15.500* :  on the small Orkney Island of Sandy with egg on his face,
*31:16.000- 31:18.620* :  as he ended up with more chocolate Easter eggs in stock
