*00:00.040- 00:03.320* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:05.300- 00:07.460* :  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Monday,
*00:07.460- 00:08.380* :  the 1st of April.
*00:08.380- 00:09.780* :  These are our main stories.
*00:10.480- 00:13.280* :  President Edwin's AK Party has suffered its biggest
*00:13.280- 00:15.980* :  ever defeat in municipal elections in Turkey.
*00:16.580- 00:18.540* :  As major protests take place in Jerusalem,
*00:18.540- 00:21.920* :  the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he'll do
*00:21.920- 00:24.900* :  everything in his power to get hostages in Gaza home.
*00:27.400- 00:29.580* :  Also in this podcast, we hear from people in the
*00:29.580- 00:32.900* :  Ukrainian city of Harkiv, who live in fear of a new Russian
*00:32.900- 00:37.680* :  advance. And I came back full of confidence, so inspired to
*00:37.680- 00:41.320* :  give back to the community that I became a charity worker and
*00:41.320- 00:43.280* :  his all thanks to the homeless worker.
*00:43.840- 00:46.680* :  How football's homeless world cup is changing lives.
*00:50.220- 00:51.940* :  Let's begin the podcast in Turkey.
*00:56.240- 00:59.220* :  Now as we record this edition, supporters of the main opposition
*00:59.220- 01:02.460* :  party are out on the streets waving flags and banners in
*01:02.460- 01:05.960* :  Istanbul, celebrating a strong showing in local elections.
*01:06.640- 01:09.280* :  With most of the ballots now counted, the party has already
*01:09.280- 01:11.720* :  declared victory in both the country's biggest cities,
*01:12.380- 01:13.260* :  Istanbul and Ankara.
*01:13.720- 01:16.780* :  There's particular focus on Istanbul, whose mayor is seen as
*01:16.780- 01:19.720* :  the best placed opposition candidate for the next presidential
*01:19.720- 01:21.540* :  poll in four years time.
*01:22.080- 01:24.820* :  President Regeptive Erdogan has acknowledged the election
*01:25.180- 01:28.360* :  didn't achieve the desired results on or error from BBC
*01:28.360- 01:29.720* :  Turkish gave me the latest.
*01:30.280- 01:33.240* :  Right now, more than 80% of the votes have been counted.
*01:33.460- 01:36.360* :  And the main opposition party, CHP, is leading.
*01:36.980- 01:40.380* :  They have control of the major cities in Turkey.
*01:40.960- 01:45.520* :  And for the first time in the century, they control more cities
*01:45.520- 01:48.320* :  and municipalities than the government party.
*01:48.680- 01:52.240* :  And this is a pretty significant defeat for President Erdogan.
*01:52.240- 01:54.380* :  We've been hearing from him in the last few minutes.
*01:54.580- 01:58.580* :  Yes, he just spoke and he said this wasn't the result we wanted.
*01:59.220- 02:02.720* :  But he also said this is not an end for our party, but a turning
*02:02.720- 02:07.040* :  point. And he said Turkish voters have warned us and they will
*02:07.040- 02:08.500* :  listen to the warning.
*02:09.120- 02:10.980* :  How much does it actually change?
*02:11.040- 02:14.500* :  What's the significance of these particular election results?
*02:14.980- 02:18.340* :  It is a big moral boost to the opposition because they lost
*02:18.720- 02:21.700* :  the general election and presidential elections last year.
*02:22.680- 02:26.660* :  And although that was an alliance of opposition parties,
*02:27.240- 02:31.280* :  this time, the main opposition party, CHP, entered the elections
*02:31.280- 02:36.340* :  by their own and they managed to increase the number of votes.
*02:36.560- 02:41.100* :  And they more than doubled the municipalities that they are ruling now.
*02:41.760- 02:44.500* :  The economy being difficult in Turkey at the moment.
*02:44.500- 02:47.460* :  That's often such a driving force when it comes to people choosing
*02:47.500- 02:48.980* :  how to vote in elections.
*02:49.020- 02:51.840* :  Is that what's what's behind what's happened in the Turkish cities?
*02:52.520- 02:56.600* :  Yes, especially in the big cities, the cost of living crisis is felt more
*02:56.640- 02:59.600* :  because of higher rents and higher food prices.
*03:00.200- 03:04.620* :  So it had a big impact in the rural areas, the government party,
*03:04.620- 03:06.760* :  Mr. Erdogan's party still has more vote.
*03:07.240- 03:10.600* :  And we have also heard from Ekrem Imamolo,
*03:10.600- 03:13.600* :  Istanbul's mayor who tonight won his second term.
*03:13.980- 03:17.900* :  He said, this is not only an important night for Istanbul,
*03:17.900- 03:20.380* :  but also the democracies in the Western world.
*03:20.880- 03:25.460* :  He was telling that the authoritarian tendencies in the last decade
*03:25.460- 03:26.880* :  has extended a lot.
*03:27.280- 03:32.060* :  And today, Turkey showed that things can be changed in a democratic way,
*03:32.220- 03:35.080* :  although there is an authoritarian regime in the country.
*03:35.680- 03:37.360* :  Honour Erum from BBC Turkish.
*03:37.380- 03:40.980* :  My colleague Owen Bennett Jones has been getting reaction to the results
*03:40.980- 03:45.080* :  from Remesa Cadak and MP from the governing AK party in Istanbul.
*03:46.000- 03:48.140* :  We do respect the will of the people.
*03:48.820- 03:53.120* :  We receive the message from the people and we will be doing our internal discussions.
*03:53.820- 03:59.240* :  We need to work harder and harder and we need to make sure that we reach out to more people.
*03:59.820- 04:02.160* :  What do you think has gone wrong for the president?
*04:02.160- 04:04.020* :  Yeah, this is quite a result.
*04:04.780- 04:06.960* :  Well, local elections have their own dynamics.
*04:06.960- 04:11.040* :  So this is very early, still very, very early to speculate.
*04:12.620- 04:15.920* :  And what we can say, we will have our internal discussions.
*04:17.120- 04:17.240* :  Right.
*04:17.300- 04:19.740* :  I mean, well, there's some obvious ideas that could be out there.
*04:19.740- 04:22.440* :  Inflation, is it 65, 70 percent?
*04:23.520- 04:30.040* :  It's too early at this point to make a conclusion about the reasons behind that.
*04:30.900- 04:35.820* :  We need to work harder for people because we have done a lot for the people of Istanbul
*04:35.840- 04:37.100* :  and the people of Turkey.
*04:37.520- 04:43.220* :  Maybe we need to reach out to more people and tell our message of unity and what we have done for them.
*04:43.880- 04:47.160* :  Whatever people decide, this is a nature of democracy.
*04:47.220- 04:48.500* :  You can't always win.
*04:49.080- 04:55.360* :  So this just shows that we have a very vibrant democracy and we should just respect the will of the people.
*04:55.800- 04:58.400* :  That's what I know as an MP in Istanbul.
*04:58.940- 05:02.480* :  Remesa Cadak and MP from the governing AK party in Turkey.
*05:03.140- 05:08.920* :  Next to Israel, where the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given his first news conference in over a month.
*05:09.460- 05:12.940* :  It comes as Israel continues its strikes against Hamas targets,
*05:12.940- 05:18.180* :  including one near a hospital in central Gaza, in which four people are confirmed to have been killed.
*05:18.760- 05:24.740* :  Mr Netanyahu said the Israeli military was continuing its preparations for an assault on the southern city of Raffa.
*05:25.160- 05:30.420* :  And he maintained he was doing everything he could to secure the release of the 130 or so Israeli hostages
*05:30.780- 05:32.460* :  who remained captives of Hamas.
*05:34.460- 05:40.720* :  As the Prime Minister of Israel, I will do everything in my power to bring our beloved people home.
*05:41.820- 05:46.020* :  Our efforts to get those hostages back are continuing all the time.
*05:47.240- 05:53.040* :  Whenever we get intelligence, we put our heroic fighters in danger in order to do that.
*05:54.020- 06:00.480* :  And we have had some success, but getting them back is a combination of negotiation and military force.
*06:01.000- 06:05.380* :  And it has already enabled us to get back almost half the hostages.
*06:08.840- 06:13.340* :  Mr Netanyahu was scheduled to undergo surgery for a hernia late on Sunday.
*06:14.000- 06:21.560* :  I spoke to the BBC's Middle East bureau Chief Joe Floto and began by asking Joe why Mr Netanyahu had decided to give a news conference now.
*06:22.780- 06:25.940* :  He was there to deliver some reassurance and some warnings.
*06:25.940- 06:36.540* :  So the reassurance was that he was alive and well and vigorously in charge of his government, just before he hands over the reins to his deputy while he goes under the knife tonight.
*06:37.340- 06:45.040* :  And the other reassurance was to those protesters and thousands of them are gathered in Jerusalem this evening who want him to step down
*06:46.280- 06:47.940* :  because the hostages aren't being released.
*06:47.940- 06:56.300* :  So he was very clear to say we're doing everything we can, but it has been four months since the last truce managed to secure the release of hostages.
*06:56.660- 06:59.560* :  And very little has been seen since.
*06:59.560- 07:05.680* :  So the warnings were to those protesters, I think, that if they're calling for elections, that would play into Hamas's hands.
*07:06.520- 07:12.600* :  And another warning that he's still very much planning on a military assault at the southern town of Raffa.
*07:12.920- 07:22.000* :  Yes, he came under quite a bit of pressure over Raffa from Germany's Sasking questions, because I guess the point is they keep talking about an assault on Raffa, but it never happens.
*07:23.000- 07:35.800* :  He has been talking about it for weeks now and one of his war cabinet colleagues had even said that if there wasn't a deal and if their hostages weren't released before the start of Ramadan, we started two weeks ago.
*07:35.800- 07:59.020* :  And then the assault would begin, however, the United States, Israel's strongest ally has been very, very clear that an assault, a full scale assault on Raffa, which is a small town swollen by around a million people who've been displaced from the parts of Gaza, that that would be unacceptable because of the casualties and the the misery that would reap upon all those displaced civilians.
*07:59.800- 08:28.120* :  So they've been suggesting that there are other options and really been very vocal in telling the Israeli government they shouldn't consider that and not only the United States, but other European countries as well have voiced their concerns and the United Nations have said it would be a catastrophe, but tonight Netanyahu was saying again that this is what he needs to do in order to defeat Hamas and that that is the point of this war, after all, is to make sure that Hamas are never in a position to strike Israel again.
*08:28.860- 08:38.220* :  In terms of Benjamin Netanyahu's own health, he's not a young man. What more details have we been given about this hernia operation is due to undergo?
*08:38.940- 08:52.820* :  Very little, he's not a young man, you're right, he's 74 years old and last year, everyone was quite surprised to hear that he'd undergone a sort of cardiac operation to install a pacemaker in his heart.
*08:54.100- 09:15.140* :  Today's announcement, very much low key, it's a routine operation, it needs a hernia, something that millions of people undergo all the time, but he was very keen to be seen before he hands over the reins in his own words to quell some of the ridiculous rumours that came out last time that he was ill.
*09:15.800- 09:25.500* :  Joe Floto with me from Jerusalem, Romania and Bulgaria have become the newest members of Europe, Schengen area of free movement, but only for air and sea crossings.
*09:25.960- 09:31.180* :  These travelers at Bulgaria's Sophia Airport on Sunday morning were pleased about the lifting of restrictions.
*09:33.400- 09:41.120* :  It's extraordinary, what can I say, it's a special feeling, I took out my passport for nothing, it's nice to feel like a European citizen.
*09:42.060- 09:45.440* :  It's very easy now at the borders, I have no problems at all.
*09:46.140- 09:53.380* :  Land border controls will remain in place because of Austria's opposition to the Eastern European nations becoming full members of the zone.
*09:53.860- 09:56.460* :  Here's our central Europe correspondent, Nick Thorpe.
*09:56.820- 10:04.400* :  Schengen has long been a magic word in Romania and Bulgaria, the goal of countless governments and the frustration of countless citizens.
*10:04.400- 10:15.120* :  This morning something changed, passengers landing at any Romanian or Bulgarian airport from 27 Schengen countries will not face passport checks.
*10:15.720- 10:28.360* :  Citizens from the rest of the world can apply for Schengen visa at the Bulgarian or Romanian embassies, valid for all Schengen member countries, but the long queues of trucks at the land borders will remain.
*10:28.500- 10:35.620* :  Austria is the main obstacle, the inner fears and influx of migrants when all border controls disappear.
*10:36.240- 10:42.280* :  And with elections due in Austria later this year, that position is unlikely to change soon.
*10:42.800- 10:49.040* :  Playing football for your country can be life-changing, but that's especially true for those playing in the homeless world cup.
*10:49.060- 10:57.220* :  The tournament which sees 70 countries take part isn't just about competing for the trophy, it's about helping those struggling to find a home.
*10:57.740- 11:05.400* :  Now an internationally recognised face is starring in a movie inspired by the competition and has been talking to our culture reporter, Yasmin Rufo.
*11:05.940- 11:09.660* :  Come on you f***er!
*11:17.980- 11:28.920* :  Bill Nye, he's come down to a south London football pitch to give some friendly advice to some of the players who are hoping to be selected to represent England this year at the homeless world cup.
*11:29.200- 11:41.720* :  We have a fictional one, obviously, which was set in Rome, and I, you're allowed to laugh, I play the England coach, and it's basically me and a bunch of young nutters roaming about Rome.
*11:48.120- 11:55.220* :  I am a big football fan, my home team is Christian Palace, but I love all football. The Champions League is the Holy Grail.
*11:55.220- 12:03.780* :  The Champions League, when the music starts, I am at peace. Competition brings us all together. A second chance to be part of the team.
*12:11.300- 12:16.020* :  They say it's a universal language which is for about half the world, including me.
*12:16.520- 12:24.000* :  The power of football brings people from all parts of the world together in the same place and they have to combine and work together.
*12:25.620- 12:32.620* :  Sharing Nye's love of football is Raffa Zeez, who represented England in the 2018 homeless world cup tournament in Mexico.
*12:32.620- 12:45.160* :  Over a number of years I had to experience homelessness in different ways, eventually led me to jail a couple of times, and then I spent about four years living in a Salvation Army hostel.
*12:45.460- 12:54.740* :  Football became my life, so after a handful of years I had the good news that I was going to represent England even though I'm French, and I went to Mexico in 2018.
*12:55.780- 12:59.720* :  And there is clearly a before and after the World Cup.
*12:59.920- 13:11.560* :  You're about to represent your country, so officially supplied by the FA itself, and when you put on this shirt, you're putting on the history of the beautiful game.
*13:12.000- 13:21.700* :  I came back full of confidence, so inspired to give back to the community that I became a charity worker, so I've been full-cycle a couple of times since my homeless days,
*13:22.140- 13:24.340* :  and it's all thanks to the homeless world cup.
*13:28.300- 13:32.080* :  Raff's experiences are not too dissimilar to one of the film's cast members.
*13:36.440- 13:39.240* :  Top Boy actor Michael Ward was once homeless himself.
*13:39.800- 13:44.840* :  Me and my family have been homeless many times as well, and I haven't realised that because my mum has basically tried to cover it up.
*13:45.380- 13:52.240* :  It's a global issue that definitely needs help tackling, and I'm glad that the homeless world cup does a little part of that.
*13:52.440- 13:58.780* :  Meeting some of the real homeless world cup players during filming has given Michael a new perspective on homelessness.
*13:58.820- 14:11.240* :  Don't judge a book by its cover. I'm guilty of that, but a lot of the time it's not there for, and if someone had come in earlier and not judged or anything like that, it might have been able to help them.
*14:12.880- 14:16.740* :  And what's the point of the film? Well, for Bill Nye, there is only one takeaway.
*14:16.740- 14:24.260* :  If I had one wish for the film, is that audiences can see that homeless people aren't a species.
*14:24.780- 14:28.860* :  They're individuals and they're people, they're human beings, and they have different stories.
*14:28.860- 14:38.120* :  They come from different and they are. They're in that situation for different reasons, and they're not to be considered as some kind of tribe within the tribe.
*14:38.120- 14:43.520* :  Everyone has a reason for being here, and every player has a story to tell. Are you ready?
*14:46.840- 14:49.280* :  Bill Nye, ending that report by Yasmin Rufo.
*14:51.740- 14:57.280* :  Still to come, one of the world's most wanted men has been found, be a prolific reviewer on Google.
*14:57.780- 14:58.420* :  And...
*14:58.660- 15:04.260* :  It's so hot. We stop for a bit because otherwise the sand would kill us.
*15:04.380- 15:10.260* :  We join a police raid in Brazil investigating degrading working conditions in the Canuba wax industry.
*15:18.200- 15:22.860* :  Supporters of India's main opposition alliance came out onto the streets of Delhi on Sunday,
*15:23.300- 15:27.100* :  ahead of next month's general election. They were protesting against the arrest of the
*15:27.100- 15:32.180* :  capital's chief minister on corruption charges and say the governing BJP is targeting its
*15:32.180- 15:35.760* :  political opponents to prevent them from campaigning for next month's election.
*15:35.760- 15:40.080* :  Our South Asia regional editor and barrison, Etha Rajan, was at the rally.
*15:40.460- 15:46.220* :  Opposition supporters have gathered here and they are coming from Delhi and other neighbouring states
*15:46.260- 15:51.820* :  near the capital city, and now they are calling for the release of urban cage revolt.
*15:52.520- 15:58.380* :  The Delhi chief minister, he was taken into custody 10 days ago on corruption charges which he
*15:58.380- 16:05.920* :  denies. Major leaders are addressing this rally saying that India's democracy and constitution
*16:06.740- 16:10.820* :  should be saved and that is their motive of this major rally here.
*16:11.560- 16:17.140* :  The Congress party says that its bank accounts have been frozen and they have been asked to pay
*16:17.140- 16:24.580* :  more than $200 million in fine for allegedly violating tax rules. But the government denies
*16:24.880- 16:29.360* :  any political motive behind that action saying the law will take its own cause.
*16:30.240- 16:35.280* :  Now India's elections are due to start on the 19th of April and it will be held in several
*16:35.280- 16:41.760* :  faces. The campaign is going across the country but what the opposition is saying is that there is
*16:41.760- 16:48.360* :  no level playing field. For example, they accuse the election commission of being biased towards
*16:48.360- 16:54.320* :  the governing BJP and they say that investigative agencies are being used to cripple them,
*16:54.620- 17:01.520* :  to stifle dissent, to prevent them from campaigning. However, the governing BJP denies these charges
*17:02.100- 17:08.420* :  and the mammoth exercise of India's general election in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is
*17:08.420- 17:12.740* :  seeking a third straight term is starting on the 19th of April.
*17:13.780- 17:18.240* :  Anne-Barrasson et the Rajan in Delhi. Over the weekend, as on many previous days,
*17:18.240- 17:23.720* :  Ukraine suffered a series of airstrikes from Russia targeting military and energy infrastructure.
*17:24.440- 17:28.800* :  It's another blow to a nation now on the defensive. Running out of weapons and ammunition,
*17:29.200- 17:33.680* :  its skies increasingly dominated by Russian aircraft missiles and drones.
*17:34.400- 17:39.660* :  Ukrainian land forces have been pushed back by Russian attacks as well and cities close to
*17:39.660- 17:45.580* :  the front line like Harkiv in the northeast once again fear a Russian advance. Sarah Reinsford reports.
*17:46.840- 17:53.360* :  This is what it looks like when Russia cries to take a Ukrainian city. I'm standing on a
*17:53.360- 17:59.960* :  housing estate on the edge of Harkiv and it is a complete mess. There are giant multi-story blocks
*17:59.960- 18:05.380* :  of flats all around me. Shrapnel damage all at the side of this one. There are massive chunks
*18:05.920- 18:10.540* :  blown out of some of these buildings. Russia tried extremely hard to take Harkiv right at the
*18:10.540- 18:15.640* :  beginning of the full-scale invasion. I'm talking to people here, the worry is that it's planning
*18:15.640- 18:27.020* :  to try that again. I just check my phone and according to the app I have here, it shows that there
*18:27.020- 18:32.240* :  is an air alert right now. Immediately proceed to the nearest shelter it says.
*18:34.120- 18:36.480* :  I'm just looking around. No, there's taking any notice of that.
*18:38.260- 18:42.940* :  Can I say, here is the microphone? Thank you. There's an air-raid alert now but you're still sitting
*18:42.940- 18:50.940* :  on the bench. Is that normal? Yeah, it's like heavy already. Yeah, we are sitting there on the bench
*18:50.940- 18:56.960* :  until we speak with my friend. Can I ask you, lots of people are talking about the fact that
*18:57.000- 19:02.320* :  they're worried that the Russians might come back again. Does that worry you? Yeah, it's worried
*19:02.320- 19:08.220* :  us, with my friends, we speak about it. Yeah, it's really scary. We're afraid.
*19:08.720- 19:15.580* :  Europe, now you feel more nervous about it. Yeah, we know what's about it, about the situation that
*19:15.640- 19:22.660* :  it will happen because they got new weapons. It's like scary as a little.
*19:27.280- 19:31.700* :  There's lots of talk about these missile attacks and also the worry about Russian
*19:32.180- 19:34.660* :  poses coming and trying to take hard people again. Are you worried?
*19:34.660- 19:36.160* :  Yes, I'm a Muslim, I'm a Muslim.
*19:37.620- 19:43.880* :  And I believe herself is from a Muslim region. Now she lives here and her husband is fighting
*19:43.920- 19:47.320* :  in their men. She's not going anywhere she wants to stay further to her family.
*19:48.120- 19:54.200* :  She says that same kind of mood is among the team. They're trying to spread this mood to their
*19:54.200- 19:58.400* :  clients as well. They believe that Ukraine will win.
*20:01.920- 20:05.400* :  It was just telling me that lots of people in the archive grew up speaking Russian.
*20:06.240- 20:10.680* :  And ever since the full scale invasion, there's been this very obvious switch
*20:11.640- 20:16.620* :  away from Russian. And clearly that's a political decision and it's a sign of
*20:17.120- 20:21.060* :  people's allegiances here that it wants to be part of Russia at all.
*20:23.040- 20:27.740* :  Our correspondent Sarah Rainesford, one of the world's most wanted men he'd think would
*20:27.740- 20:32.160* :  want to keep a low profile has been leaving Google reviews on the internet.
*20:32.680- 20:37.080* :  Reports from the website Belling Cat and the Sunday Times newspaper here in the UK say
*20:37.080- 20:42.300* :  Christy Kinehan and Irish gangster has been writing hundreds of reviews of restaurants, hotels
*20:42.300- 20:47.340* :  and events giving investigators a rare insight into his psychology and movements.
*20:48.160- 20:52.660* :  Mr. Kinehan who uses the alias Christopher Vincent lives in Dubai with his two sons
*20:52.660- 20:59.000* :  having left Ireland in 2016 and followed a bit of feud with a rival gang in which 18 people
*20:59.000- 21:04.200* :  were murdered. John Mooney is an investigative journalist and host of the dark state podcast.
*21:04.200- 21:07.580* :  He told urn Bennett Jones more about Christy Kinehan.
*21:08.240- 21:14.360* :  Well, Christy Kinehan is the leader of a transnational organized crime group that is reputed to be
*21:14.360- 21:19.720* :  one of the most powerful in the world. Indeed, it's tentacled stretch right across the globe.
*21:19.720- 21:26.720* :  So it is responsible for much of the code cane trade in Europe, but it is also involved in
*21:26.720- 21:32.520* :  money laundering activities. It has connections into hostile states like Russia and Venezuela
*21:33.380- 21:42.000* :  and Iran. So the organization itself is reputed to have a mass of fortune of 1.5 billion at this
*21:42.000- 21:48.440* :  stage. So it is one of the world's premier criminal organizations. And all of those very serious
*21:48.440- 21:53.760* :  allegations have gone through courts and led to convictions, right? Christy Kinehan is a convicted
*21:53.760- 21:59.260* :  drug trafficker. He is the first conviction occurred in the eighties and he served a significant
*21:59.260- 22:04.560* :  prison sentence for heroin dealing. He has subsequently been arrested on numerous occasions
*22:04.740- 22:12.600* :  and indeed has served more prison sentences in Ireland and Belgium. So he is a quite a serious
*22:12.600- 22:19.820* :  criminal who spends a considerable amount of time in prison, but he is unusual insofar as that he
*22:19.820- 22:27.180* :  put his time in prison to good use. And indeed, he studied for various degrees whilst inside and also
*22:27.180- 22:34.680* :  became proficient in various languages and is now actually multilingual man. Right. And so far,
*22:34.680- 22:40.660* :  has avoided extradition. So I guess the point is that a man in this situation you would think
*22:40.660- 22:47.060* :  would be keeping a very low profile. So it is surprising that he is doing lots of reviews online
*22:47.060- 22:53.520* :  under a rather sort of flimsy fake name. The Sunday times and belling cash our partners on this
*22:53.520- 23:00.340* :  project began investigating what looked like Google reviews that were being posted by an account
*23:00.340- 23:06.460* :  which we believed was Christy Kinehan some six months ago. And we quickly established that
*23:06.460- 23:12.360* :  indeed it was him and country to the public's impression of him as a man who would be
*23:12.960- 23:20.100* :  uber cautious, very security aware. It appeared that in his spare time he literally could not stop
*23:20.100- 23:27.980* :  posting reviews about everything from his local supermarket to COVID testing centers to at one
*23:27.980- 23:34.800* :  stage, he even reviewed away tropes. And what we did was we traced all of these reviews and
*23:34.800- 23:40.740* :  built up a very detailed picture of his travel various locations at various times. But we were
*23:40.740- 23:46.160* :  also able to connect him to various meetings in different parts of the world. He's someone that
*23:46.160- 23:55.300* :  it appears to me that when he is idle, he just simply reviews and posts these things. And he comes
*23:55.300- 24:01.880* :  across as a man who's very concerned about service. He likes value for money. He's very impatient.
*24:02.520- 24:11.340* :  He is just someone who appears almost to be very grouchy, very argumentative behind the scenes.
*24:11.340- 24:17.200* :  And he's just one of the I suppose what most people might call an awkward customer.
*24:17.480- 24:22.020* :  A bit grumpy. Well, the other aspect of these reviews that's so amazing is sometimes he takes
*24:22.020- 24:28.300* :  pictures and highly incompetent in the sense that he ends up filming himself in the sort of
*24:28.300- 24:33.700* :  reflection of windows and that kind of thing. Again, helping law enforcement work out where he is.
*24:33.700- 24:37.140* :  Although there may be law enforcement, no perfectly well where he is. And it's just a question
*24:37.140- 24:42.660* :  of getting the UAE to extradite him, is it? I think both of the statements are correct.
*24:43.580- 24:49.340* :  Can n't taught he was being careful about the photographs and images he took. So he would take
*24:49.340- 24:56.300* :  for example, an image of a hotel lobby. But when you're using a camera phone, he would often miss
*24:56.300- 25:01.880* :  his own reflection being caught in a mirror or something like that. The best way of maybe thinking
*25:01.880- 25:07.440* :  about this is to hold a contradictory view of it. Whilst he is a very proficient criminal
*25:07.440- 25:14.000* :  and he is very security conscious, he also simply does not understand modern technology.
*25:14.020- 25:19.520* :  If you post dozens of reviews on Google Maps and if you upload lots of pictures,
*25:20.060- 25:23.940* :  you are going to give away digital crumbs, should I say, to trace your movements.
*25:24.680- 25:29.860* :  Jonas, John Mooney, Canaver Wax is a product you may not have heard of, but you've almost
*25:29.860- 25:35.780* :  certainly consumed it. It's added to sweets to stop them from melting, to pills to make them
*25:35.780- 25:41.400* :  easier to swallow. And it's used as a thickener in lipstick and mascara. Harvesting the wax
*25:41.400- 25:45.240* :  from palm trees in Brazil is an industry in which according to the authorities,
*25:45.240- 25:51.220* :  companies are failing to improve working conditions. Last year, more than 3,000 workers across
*25:51.220- 25:56.900* :  all industries were rescued from situations including forced labor and degrading work conditions.
*25:57.620- 26:01.940* :  Our correspondent Katie Watson was given exclusive access to a raid with the federal police
*26:01.940- 26:08.540* :  in Northeastern Brazil. We're heading to a farm where authorities suspect workers are being
*26:08.540- 26:16.520* :  exploited. They want to catch the culprits red-handed. This hot and dry terrain is unforgiving.
*26:17.080- 26:22.020* :  The OE is one of the borers parts of Brazil. It's home to the spiky Canuba palm tree,
*26:22.420- 26:27.560* :  and cutting down its leaves and harvesting the wax provides a livelihood to hundreds of thousands
*26:27.560- 26:35.420* :  of people. We find workers sheltering from the midday sun. Who's in charge here, the lead investigator
*26:35.420- 26:41.420* :  asks, one by one, the men are interviewed. The boss, nowhere to be seen. It is Marperera,
*26:41.420- 26:47.360* :  he's one of the unregistered workers. It's so hot, we stop for a bit because otherwise,
*26:47.360- 26:53.300* :  they send with kiosk. Lunch arrives, rice and chicken feet. People here have famished.
*26:55.560- 27:00.920* :  Canuba harvesting is difficult work. The rough palm trees can cut their hands. The heat is
*27:01.520- 27:06.880* :  exhausting. The authorities are asking the workers here to carry out their daily jobs just to see
*27:06.880- 27:12.860* :  how they do it, how safely they do it, just get a full picture of their day-to-day activities.
*27:14.460- 27:19.180* :  The men have very little training as they direct a long bamboo pole with a sigh at the end of it
*27:19.500- 27:24.660* :  to chop down the heavy leaves. The leaves are then strapped onto donkeys to lead the men to a
*27:24.660- 27:32.080* :  pile for the material to dry. In Brazil, working conditions that are degrading or risk workers'
*27:32.080- 27:37.600* :  health can fall under the definition of modern-day slavery. Evidence of that is at the accommodation
*27:37.600- 27:43.340* :  block, too. Inspectors Gisleini Melodos Santos Tashowski shows me more breaches of labor laws.
*27:43.800- 27:48.700* :  The ceilings are so low, you have to duck to enter the main door. People sleeping in hammocks
*27:49.100- 27:54.100* :  itself not a problem, but their holes in the roof and broken electricity sockets dangling from
*27:54.100- 28:03.980* :  the ceiling. Boss Ed Milson shows up and has been fined $30,000. This is the third time he's been
*28:03.980- 28:10.720* :  caught breaking the rules he's angry. The government needs to give small producers like me
*28:10.720- 28:17.860* :  more of a chance. I have been fighting to survive for some time now. The costs of producing this wax
*28:17.860- 28:22.660* :  are more than what I received. Ed Milson wouldn't go on the record about who he sells to.
*28:23.100- 28:28.300* :  This is very common, says Gisleini, and makes it impossible to trace from producer to buyer.
*28:28.600- 28:34.300* :  In 2016, the state concerned with the number of workers they were rescuing in difficult conditions,
*28:34.800- 28:39.400* :  asked the top five biggest wax processing companies to sign an agreement committing
*28:39.400- 28:45.360* :  themselves to improving the supply chain and ending this informality. The BBC was shown the
*28:45.360- 28:50.600* :  client list of the region's biggest wax processor, Brazil Serras, they include big companies
*28:50.600- 28:56.160* :  like L'Oreal. According to prosecutors, producers found to have employed workers in conditions
*28:56.160- 29:02.040* :  analogous to slave labour say they sold wax to Brazil Serras even after the company said they'd
*29:02.040- 29:06.180* :  improve the supply chain, but it's hard to prove because there isn't a paper trail.
*29:09.060- 29:13.500* :  Brazil Serras told the BBC that it only works with suppliers that can prove they comply with
*29:13.500- 29:19.200* :  labour laws. L'Oreal says it too is committed to ethical sourcing and has implemented an audit
*29:19.200- 29:26.620* :  program with its suppliers to ensure due diligence. Investigators Gisleini, though,
*29:26.620- 29:32.680* :  says despite those promises, nothing changes. In the 11 years she's been rescuing workers in this
*29:32.680- 29:38.420* :  industry, the supply chain has consistently been impossible to trace. There's what we call the
*29:38.420- 29:43.880* :  liberate blind owners. It's comfortable for the industry not to see the problems because they
*29:43.880- 29:50.480* :  don't need to act, they don't need to pay. It is as so often as the case, an unequal power balance
*29:50.900- 29:54.840* :  between producers on the ground and the financially powerful businesses far away,
*29:55.580- 29:58.800* :  but in the Carnuba wax industry, many benefit from that divide.
*30:01.120- 30:05.080* :  Casey Watson reporting now, before we end this podcast, let's hear some of the
*30:05.080- 30:10.920* :  Easter Day celebrations around the world. In Jerusalem, worshippers attended mass at the church
*30:10.920- 30:15.420* :  of the Holy Sepulchre, believed by many to be the place where Jesus was crucified.
*30:26.560- 30:29.520* :  And tens of thousands gathered in St Peter Square in Rome.
*30:45.340- 30:47.500* :  Some of the sounds of Easter, 2024.
*30:50.200- 30:53.940* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
*30:54.320- 30:57.960* :  If you'd like to comment on this podcast and the stories we included, drop us an email,
