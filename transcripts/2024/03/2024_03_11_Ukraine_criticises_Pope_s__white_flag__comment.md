*01:35.140- 01:38.840* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:40.980- 01:45.400* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Monday 11th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:45.400- 01:51.260* :  Pope Francis is facing a barrage of criticism over his comments suggesting Ukraine should
*01:51.260- 01:56.740* :  consider itself defeated and should negotiate an end to the war with Russia. The Saudi
*01:56.740- 02:02.120* :  King has used his Ramadan message to call for an end to what he described as brutal crimes
*02:02.120- 02:10.660* :  against Palestinians in Gaza. Also in this podcast, we hear the shooting two weeks ago. I had
*02:10.660- 02:16.360* :  the children who had to be flight on their stomach under the benches. This shooting was so heavy
*02:16.360- 02:22.420* :  in their classrooms. As gang violence gets worse and Haiti, we hear from people in one of the slums
*02:22.420- 02:32.920* :  in the capital Porto Prince. It's not the first time that Pope Francis has been criticized for
*02:32.920- 02:37.700* :  his remarks on the war in Ukraine, but the head of the Roman Catholic Church has sparked fresh
*02:37.700- 02:43.300* :  controversy by suggesting that Kiev should negotiate with Moscow after more than two years of war
*02:43.640- 02:48.040* :  following Russia's invasion of the country. The Pope's comments were in an interview recorded
*02:48.040- 02:54.020* :  last month, but released on Saturday. In that interview, the Pope said the strongest one is the
*02:54.020- 03:00.020* :  one that looks at the situation, thinks about the population, and has the courage of the white flag.
*03:01.980- 03:07.740* :  The word negotiate is a courageous word. When you see that you are defeated, when things are not
*03:07.740- 03:13.400* :  going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate. One may feel shame, but how many
*03:13.400- 03:19.520* :  dead will the war end up with? One should negotiate in time, find a country that can be a mediator.
*03:20.100- 03:24.860* :  The Vatican's spokesperson has clarified his remarks, saying the Pope didn't mean to suggest
*03:24.860- 03:30.860* :  that Ukraine ought to surrender to Russia, but instead was calling for a ceasefire. But Alexei
*03:30.860- 03:36.540* :  Goncharenko, a Ukrainian MP from the southern port city of Odessa, said the Pope should condemn Russia.
*03:37.240- 03:42.340* :  If you want to command something, you should know about this. Like I just would like to invite him
*03:42.340- 03:49.100* :  to Odessa, to Buchau, to Kiev, or to Harkiv, and probably after this to command, there is a need to
*03:49.900- 03:54.460* :  condemn the genocide which Russia and Federation is committing against Ukrainians.
*03:54.780- 04:00.540* :  For us, white flag means that they will kill all of us. They are killing Ukrainians or not
*04:00.540- 04:07.580* :  occupied territories. And we want peace more than anybody in the world, because we want peace,
*04:07.640- 04:12.460* :  which doesn't mean just to destroy all of us, to kill all of us.
*04:13.240- 04:18.760* :  In addition, Poland's Foreign Minister Alexekoski said the Pope should encourage Russia to withdraw
*04:18.760- 04:25.320* :  from Ukraine. A correspondent in Kiev, James Waterhouse, had more on Ukraine's response to the Pope's
*04:25.320- 04:30.480* :  comments. Well, I mean, if you go on what Dimitro Kulebe, the Foreign Minister is saying,
*04:30.600- 04:35.920* :  there are thought to be around a million Catholics in Ukraine, but in short, no, when you look at the
*04:35.920- 04:42.540* :  kind of complex geopolitics around this, where you have Europe, the European Union, and Western
*04:42.540- 04:50.300* :  Allies, frantically trying to work out how or even if they can plug a sizable gap in terms of
*04:50.300- 04:56.860* :  military support, which is being left by the US as a sizable package there, continues to be
*04:56.860- 05:02.460* :  blocked by political disagreements in the US Congress. So I think those are the major stakeholders
*05:02.460- 05:08.960* :  which Ukraine will rely on when it comes to continuing its fight. But nevertheless, the Pope is a
*05:08.960- 05:16.180* :  hugely significant influential figure. He has talked about wanting negotiations in the past,
*05:16.180- 05:21.600* :  but despite all of the frustrations it is having at the moment, it still sees fighting as being
*05:21.600- 05:27.420* :  its only choice in this existential battle, and suggestions of otherwise, not least surrendering,
*05:27.420- 05:33.200* :  or doing the greatest thing in the words of Pope Francis the way of the White Flag, it's still seen
*05:33.200- 05:39.920* :  as deeply unpopular politically. But are they worried that the Pope coming out and saying this
*05:39.920- 05:46.460* :  might be a sign that support for Ukraine in the West is weakening that the Pope is saying what
*05:46.460- 05:51.120* :  others actually think, even if they're not seeing it publicly? Of course, there'd be that sensitivity,
*05:51.120- 05:57.400* :  you'd imagine, but I think Ukraine knows there is this fatigue that is directly hampering its
*05:57.400- 06:03.100* :  soldiers' ability to fight. There is these minority of Republicans that are hugely influential,
*06:03.100- 06:08.700* :  which are blocking the ammunition and equipment Ukraine so desperately needs. You had that
*06:09.020- 06:14.340* :  that prank call for the Italian Prime Minister Georgian Maloney, where she conceded privately,
*06:14.980- 06:19.240* :  that there was a fatigue with Western Allies. But at the moment, what it needs, I think,
*06:19.240- 06:25.360* :  or what it's hoping for is some kind of progress to present to Western Allies to say, look,
*06:25.360- 06:29.340* :  keep backing us, but President Zelensky's acknowledged. He said, look, it's easier to support
*06:30.020- 06:35.520* :  a country or a person when they're winning. And James, you are there. What is the latest on the
*06:35.520- 06:41.620* :  fighting on the ground? Are Russian troops advancing? They are. And we talked a lot, didn't we,
*06:41.620- 06:47.680* :  about the fall of this town called Evdivka a few weeks ago, somewhere that Ukraine feels that
*06:47.680- 06:51.800* :  it should never have really let go of. And it seems that Russia isn't stopping there. The Ukrainians
*06:51.800- 06:57.780* :  are struggling to establish a fallback position, a new front line, and Russia is making its
*06:57.800- 07:02.540* :  size count, and we've seen more villages being taken, more settlements, the eastern front line,
*07:02.540- 07:09.200* :  while broadly static is starting to erode for Ukraine. And it puts cities like
*07:10.040- 07:15.140* :  Constantinivka, Kupians, for example, in really difficult positions. It's incredibly difficult
*07:15.140- 07:21.340* :  for Ukraine at the moment. James Waterhouse in Kiev. With the beginning of the Muslim holy month
*07:21.340- 07:26.940* :  of Ramadan, there's intense focus on what happens in Gaza. Now the Saudi king King Salman,
*07:26.940- 07:32.240* :  in a speech read by a government minister, has characterized the situation there as a brutal
*07:32.240- 07:38.940* :  crime. It comes on top of criticism of Israel's conduct of the war from the US President Joe Biden.
*07:39.540- 07:44.480* :  And with the continuing failure to reach a ceasefire in the conflict, civilians in Gaza are
*07:44.480- 07:50.560* :  struggling to access food and clean water. Dominic Allen is from the UN Population Fund in Rafa.
*07:51.380- 07:57.580* :  I think the situation is beyond catastrophic. What I saw broke my heart. My takeaway was that
*07:57.580- 08:03.380* :  Gaza is dust. The looks in the eyes of the people as we drove through, and then we got out and
*08:03.380- 08:08.580* :  we spoke to them. The emotions are truly, they're undesirable. Everyone we passed,
*08:08.580- 08:15.300* :  everyone we spoke to was asking for food, because every day is a battle of survival in the north.
*08:15.880- 08:20.220* :  One quarter of Gaza's population is one step away from famine.
*08:20.820- 08:25.160* :  But despite the international criticism, there's little let up in Israel's offensive.
*08:25.640- 08:28.840* :  Here's Burz Bismuth, a member of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.
*08:28.840- 08:32.380* :  He's from Benjamin Netanyahu's Liquid Party.
*08:33.160- 08:37.920* :  We are at war against terrorism, not against Gaza's civilians, and any aid that comes to civilians,
*08:37.920- 08:44.020* :  we don't say no yet. Yet there is one thing that I must say. If by any chance this aid coming
*08:44.020- 08:49.120* :  by the EU, by the United States, by any country you can mention, any organization, any institution,
*08:49.120- 08:54.760* :  if the Hamas is involved in distributing this aid, this will be a big failure for me as well.
*08:55.720- 08:58.940* :  And efforts are increasing to get aid into Gaza.
*08:59.420- 09:04.340* :  The US has conducted another eardrop and a US Army logistic ship has left Virginia
*09:04.340- 09:08.120* :  on route to Gaza to establish a temporary floating pier.
*09:08.760- 09:12.560* :  Another ship, towing a barge with 200 tons of food aid for the territory,
*09:12.560- 09:17.880* :  is to depart from Cyprus. Our correspondent, Quentin Somerville, has more on that vessel.
*09:18.720- 09:24.100* :  There's about 150 to 200 tons of aid on board and has everything from flour and rice to
*09:24.360- 09:30.480* :  pre-prepared meals and water. It's quite a long journey. It's 210 nautical miles. Normally that
*09:30.480- 09:35.840* :  journey from here in Larnica to Gaza would take about 15 hours, but because pulling that
*09:35.840- 09:42.800* :  big heavy barge might take longer, and the organisations involved have said a number of times,
*09:43.180- 09:47.880* :  the most difficult part of the journey will be the last mile, because landing in Gaza will
*09:47.880- 09:53.240* :  be very difficult. It doesn't have a functioning port. And of course, in parts of Gaza,
*09:53.240- 09:58.860* :  all on order, all civil society really has broken down since Israel's bombardment and ground
*09:58.860- 10:04.500* :  invasion. And the need from the people in Gaza is absolutely desperate. So there is always
*10:04.500- 10:10.700* :  that danger that when this ship appears on the horizon and gets closer to shore, that people
*10:10.700- 10:15.080* :  will start making their way towards it, will enter the water. We've seen some pictures from
*10:15.080- 10:20.700* :  a world central kitchen, which is one of the charities involved, which seems to show a temporary
*10:20.700- 10:26.980* :  peer being built inside Gaza. Those heavy lifting equipment, large boulders and rocks are being
*10:26.980- 10:33.280* :  moved towards the foreshore to make way for the preparation for when this ship finally gets underway
*10:33.280- 10:38.800* :  and starts that journey. Quentin Somerville. Hundreds of protesters in Amsterdam have
*10:38.800- 10:44.580* :  demonstrated against Israel's military operation in Gaza at the inauguration of a museum commemorating
*10:44.580- 10:49.940* :  the Holocaust. The demonstrators demanded the arrest of the Israeli President Isaac Herzog,
*10:49.940- 10:55.960* :  who was at the ceremony, accusing him of complicity in genocide. He is our Europe regional editor,
*10:56.360- 11:02.060* :  Danny Eberhardt. The inauguration of the Dutch National Holocaust Museum could hardly have come at a
*11:02.060- 11:08.420* :  more charged time. Looming over events was the shadow of the Gaza conflict. A diverse crowd of
*11:08.420- 11:14.160* :  protesters, a number of them Jewish, gathered nearby to denounce the invitation of President Herzog.
*11:14.820- 11:20.620* :  Jews against genocide read some placards. Demonstrators charted a phrase deployed later,
*11:20.620- 11:23.720* :  but in a very different sense by Mr Herzog.
*11:26.760- 11:31.460* :  There were calls from Mr Herzog to be arrested and judged at the international criminal court in
*11:31.460- 11:32.080* :  the hage.
*11:45.360- 11:50.980* :  Many protesters emphasised they were not demonstrating against the museum itself. It commemorates
*11:50.980- 11:57.360* :  those killed in the Second World War by the Nazis during an occupation that lasted from 1940 to 1945.
*11:58.380- 12:04.480* :  The vast majority were Jewish, but some victims were Roma and Sinti. Three quarters of Dutch Jews
*12:04.480- 12:10.720* :  were killed, more than 100,000 people, most after having been deported to concentration camps.
*12:11.480- 12:15.280* :  It was a higher proportion than any other occupied country in Western Europe.
*12:16.220- 12:21.380* :  The Dutch king Willem Alexander spoke at the main ceremony in a synagogue near the museum,
*12:21.380- 12:27.400* :  attended by Holocaust survivors and their relatives. He said the new institution was about more than
*12:27.400- 12:31.920* :  recounting the stories of those murdered and cut loose from society decades ago.
*12:40.300- 12:46.940* :  A hurricane that blows away everything we hold dear. Let us never forget the Nazi
*12:46.940- 12:53.460* :  Sobiborl concentration camp in Poland started here in our Vondelpark with a sign,
*12:53.580- 13:01.060* :  Jews forbidden. There is no excuse for ignorance. Mr Herzog made similar remarks.
*13:01.060- 13:07.000* :  This institution sends a clear, powerful statement. Remember,
*13:07.980- 13:15.920* :  remember the horrors born of hatred anti-Semitism and racism, and never again allow them to flourish.
*13:16.960- 13:24.440* :  Unfortunately, never again is now, right now, because right now hatred and anti-Semitism
*13:24.440- 13:30.120* :  are flourishing worldwide. The Israeli President also called for the immediate release of Jewish
*13:30.120- 13:36.080* :  hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. lyrics from a Dutch singer-songwriter who played at the
*13:36.080- 13:40.160* :  ceremony dauerbopp seemed to have echoes of a polarized day.
*13:55.000- 13:59.520* :  Afterwards, the king was booed when he arrived at the museum itself for a tour.
*14:00.220- 14:06.640* :  Outside tensions rose. Crow Palestinian demonstrators berated a smaller group of people
*14:06.640- 14:14.020* :  waving Israeli flags. Some also climbed on and jostled police fans. Officers responded with tear
*14:14.020- 14:20.620* :  gas, a day that should have unified people left many on both sides with a bitter taste in the mouth.
*14:22.240- 14:29.160* :  Danny Aberhardt reporting. As we record this podcast in London in Los Angeles, nominees for this
*14:29.160- 14:34.820* :  year's Oscars are nervously waiting to find out who has won this year's awards as the ceremony
*14:34.820- 14:40.700* :  gets underway at the Delby Theatre in Hollywood. One of those waiting for his category to be called
*14:40.700- 14:46.580* :  is the sound designer on the film The Zone of Interest, which is also vying with movies like
*14:46.580- 14:52.820* :  Oppenheimer and Barbie for the prize of Best Picture. The British film was shot almost entirely
*14:52.820- 14:58.600* :  within the walls of the home of the camp common-danted Auschwitz. The power of the film lies in the
*14:58.600- 15:04.820* :  contrast between the cozy, flower-filled existence enjoyed by his family and the horror of the death
*15:04.820- 15:11.400* :  camp next door, a world evoked entirely through sound. Johnny Bern has been nominated for the
*15:11.400- 15:17.340* :  Academy Award for Best Sound, and he told us how he'd approached the job. I read all the
*15:17.660- 15:22.360* :  available literature that you can find in bookstores and online and you know,
*15:22.360- 15:27.040* :  testing me and neural book trials and so on and we also had access to the Auschwitz Museum
*15:27.040- 15:31.500* :  Memorial Archives. My approach was just to obviously make a record of anything that
*15:32.040- 15:36.660* :  whether it was a direct reference to what something may have sounded like, like the role called
*15:36.660- 15:41.800* :  Bell, you know, 430 in the morning and summer and the sound of the electric fence and things like that.
*15:44.180- 15:49.000* :  But also gathering, testing me of events that obviously would have had a sound to them, torture
*15:49.000- 15:54.720* :  and beating and trying to work out from the many, many accounts, specifically what that would sound like.
*15:55.060- 16:02.160* :  One that is a constant light motif is gunshot. People being executed is what you certainly
*16:02.860- 16:06.460* :  imagine. Can you just tell me what you did to make sure that was authentic?
*16:07.780- 16:14.200* :  The camp was a place of mass murder and but even by gunshot alone there were like 80 to 90 executions
*16:14.200- 16:22.200* :  per day at block 11. I had a map of Auschwitz and I had to understand all the the way that sound
*16:22.200- 16:27.280* :  would travel over distance and the refractions and reflections of the buildings and how that sound
*16:27.280- 16:37.540* :  would travel to the garden. We understood and we learned that the guns that they used for execution
*16:37.540- 16:43.560* :  were the first world war guns because the modern stuff was on the front line. So we got hold of
*16:43.560- 16:48.080* :  the right guns and we found a firing range on the olive white where we could record with a similar
*16:48.620- 16:53.760* :  kind of acoustic to it and at the right distance. I think you also used the sound of football
*16:53.900- 17:01.120* :  supporters as a leader of French writers. That's right. The film does feel so realistic and it felt
*17:01.120- 17:06.960* :  kind of somehow the wrong thing to do to get a bunch of actors in a room and so her and say
*17:06.960- 17:11.260* :  pretend this is happening to you and it just felt far more appropriate to go and travel around
*17:11.260- 17:17.840* :  Europe. Young German men shouting is something you can go and find and yeah we did with the
*17:17.840- 17:24.060* :  Parisian rights was an opportunity for us which sort of suited the narrative that during this
*17:24.100- 17:33.260* :  period many of the train arrivals were actually from France. Yeah distressed French voices were
*17:33.700- 17:45.380* :  available there. There's also a sort of mechanical sound in grown in the background a lot of the time.
*17:50.240- 17:55.000* :  I mean we kind of see that as the soil of the camp. The camp was a place for enormous
*17:55.000- 18:01.400* :  industry you know arm and manufacture textiles. There was also the crematorium and there were
*18:01.800- 18:08.200* :  mass movements of people. That sound is an amalgamation of most of the things that I've found in
*18:08.200- 18:13.760* :  my learnings basically. Can I ask you a final question, a personal question for me rather than you
*18:13.760- 18:19.100* :  but I bought the Martin Ames book that it's loosely based on when it came out and after a while
*18:19.100- 18:24.840* :  I stopped reading it because I felt awkward about the fact that this terrible event that we know
*18:24.840- 18:29.560* :  quite a lot about factually was being fictionalized. Do you think it was right to make the film I
*18:29.560- 18:35.900* :  suppose is the question? Well I think in a world where you know there is still so much pain
*18:35.900- 18:40.640* :  happening and these things could happen again. I think it's absolutely right isn't it to
*18:40.900- 18:46.940* :  to retell the story and I think so long as you aim to do that with you know with as much
*18:46.940- 18:52.240* :  sensitivity as possible it certainly felt for me the right thing to do to be a part of it yes.

*19:25.980- 19:31.620* :  Honey why are you packing a suit with swim trunks and sunscreen? Because I can't wear the same
*19:31.620- 19:37.260* :  suit for fine dining and kayaking total faux pas. Then I need something casual for the roller
*19:37.260- 19:43.480* :  coasters. Oh and the music festival meeting's water side. Really? Look like your work trip to Tampa Bay

*20:31.920- 20:37.940* :  As we record this podcast it's been reported that EU diplomats have left Haiti. The Caribbean
*20:37.940- 20:43.760* :  country where gang violence following a mass jailbreak at the beginning of March is getting worse.
*20:44.420- 20:50.100* :  Essential US Embassy staff were airlifted out of the country on Sunday as a state of emergency
*20:50.100- 20:56.660* :  in Haiti was extended and gang stepped up their calls for the Prime Minister Ariel Henri to step down.
*20:56.780- 21:02.520* :  With the main roads out of the Haitian capital closed and police officers confined to the port,
*21:02.520- 21:07.900* :  airport and key ministries, a senior UN official in the city has warned of food shortages.
*21:08.620- 21:13.280* :  Philip Blascha is chief of mission for the international organisation for migration.
*21:14.120- 21:20.480* :  For months already food has been an issue with inflation and difficulty to to which access to food
*21:21.280- 21:27.540* :  but with the looting of the port and the fact that the airport also is no more operational.
*21:27.540- 21:32.560* :  It is anticipated that food will be a big problem in the coming days.
*21:33.380- 21:39.180* :  Sister Paisy is a French nun who spent the past 20 years living and working with children
*21:39.180- 21:45.780* :  in an impoverished area of Porto Prince called Citi Saleh. James Kumarassami spoke to her.
*21:46.560- 21:53.560* :  These past few days the streets in Porto Prince have seen a lot of violence which is different
*21:53.560- 22:00.340* :  from the violence that was already there before because in the past years and months gangs were
*22:00.340- 22:07.160* :  fighting with each other against each other but in the past few days we have united with each other
*22:07.600- 22:12.140* :  in order to fight against the government institutions. When the gangs were fighting
*22:12.180- 22:16.900* :  one against the other the fighting was mostly in the poor area, in the slam areas.
*22:17.920- 22:24.220* :  But now this has been taking place in other parts of the city around government institutions.
*22:24.220- 22:29.420* :  They even tried, like before yesterday, they tried to take over the national palace.
*22:30.000- 22:33.400* :  They failed because the police food went back.
*22:34.140- 22:38.240* :  What does that meant for you and the people that you work with?
*22:39.200- 22:44.500* :  The people I work with are mostly children. We have homes for children who had been on the streets.
*22:45.240- 22:52.660* :  So these homes are running. We had difficulties like to get water and food for the past few days
*22:53.200- 22:58.080* :  because of these violence and the barricades in the streets. But yesterday, Saturday,
*22:58.680- 23:04.360* :  we were able to get water for the homes. And then we also have the children in the schools.
*23:04.460- 23:11.940* :  We are located inside the slam areas, which had been calm over the last few days.
*23:12.060- 23:14.560* :  So we were able to continue working in our schools.
*23:15.340- 23:21.700* :  And in the longer term, what are you expecting? I know a senior UN official is saying,
*23:21.700- 23:26.540* :  who's in the city saying there are concerns that if the violence continues and gets worse,
*23:26.540- 23:31.200* :  that will have an impact on the ability to get access to food and water.
*23:31.900- 23:36.700* :  Yes, and the longer term, it's really difficult to foresee what will happen.
*23:36.800- 23:42.500* :  And I am, I can say, like most of the people here are very much living one day at a time.
*23:43.240- 23:49.060* :  People from the international community send messages like they have to organize election
*23:49.060- 23:55.660* :  as soon as possible. But this is not, this shows a lack of knowledge of the reality here,
*23:55.660- 24:01.920* :  because the country has to be pacified and stabilized before there can be any election.
*24:01.920- 24:08.360* :  It's a total chaos. So to my point of view, there is no way elections can be organized
*24:09.000- 24:14.040* :  properly soon. You have experienced a lot over the last few years yourself.
*24:14.040- 24:20.540* :  Are you still feeling able to do the work you do? Are you still feeling confident to stay there?
*24:21.200- 24:28.060* :  Well, in my case, it is a mission. I feel the Lord is asking me to do what I can to to protect
*24:28.060- 24:32.980* :  was children and the children are there. I mean, we hear the shooting the last two weeks ago.
*24:32.980- 24:40.000* :  I had children who had to be for a good while flat on their stomach and other benches.
*24:40.000- 24:44.340* :  The shooting was so heavy in the classrooms. So they are very much aware.
*24:45.240- 24:50.560* :  Do they think about their future? Maybe the teenagers when they grow up,
*24:50.860- 24:58.340* :  yes, but children tend to be more in the today and just be children and play and do what
*24:58.340- 25:05.540* :  the schoolwork when we can. Sister Paisy, in Haiti. After being absent from the public eye since
*25:05.540- 25:11.240* :  Christmas, the first official photo of Catherine Princess of Wales has been published on social media.
*25:11.820- 25:16.300* :  The princess has been recuperating at home at Adelaide Cottage near Windsor Castle,
*25:16.300- 25:22.120* :  following her admission to hospital for planned abdominal surgery. The photo, along with the
*25:22.120- 25:26.860* :  message thanking people for their support, was released to mark Mother's Day here in the UK.
*25:27.700- 25:32.460* :  Our role correspondent Dan Yella-Relf has more. We hadn't actually seen the Princess of
*25:32.460- 25:36.680* :  Wales in public at all since Christmas Day when she was at Sandringham with the rest of the
*25:36.680- 25:41.060* :  world family. A couple of weeks after that, she went into hospital for this abdominal surgery
*25:41.060- 25:45.880* :  and since then we have heard very little and what that has done has created a bit of a vacuum
*25:45.880- 25:52.120* :  of information that has been filled by some wild speculation. So her team around her will be hoping
*25:52.120- 25:57.740* :  that the release of this photo today, this informal image of her sitting in jeans surrounded by her
*25:58.120- 26:03.300* :  three children laughing will do something to quell some of that speculation and curiosity
*26:03.300- 26:09.040* :  about what's wrong with her and how her recovery is going. Because it has gone right on social media
*26:09.040- 26:13.780* :  in particular, hasn't it? Yeah, it's been absolutely wild. In the past couple of weeks, prompted,
*26:13.780- 26:18.760* :  I think, by her husband, the Prince of Wales Prince William, not turning up to a Thanksgiving
*26:18.760- 26:23.760* :  service in Windsor to give thanks for the life of King Constantine of Greece who was his Godfather.
*26:24.260- 26:29.100* :  When he didn't show up to that, it just seemed to open up social media and online searches
*26:29.600- 26:34.240* :  totally to lots of crazy world rumours about what's wrong with her, where she is, what she could be
*26:34.240- 26:39.620* :  having done, what's going on. And that has put Kensington Palace, who look after the Princess,
*26:40.160- 26:44.760* :  under quite a lot of pressure to say something. Every mother's day, as it is here in the UK today,
*26:45.240- 26:49.940* :  she usually actually does issue a photo and a message. So it was a neat solution today for them to
*26:49.940- 26:55.580* :  release something. I think the problem though, many people will think is the contrast between saying
*26:55.580- 27:01.960* :  nothing and the openness about King Charles' health. Yes, there are two very different strategies
*27:01.960- 27:06.680* :  going on here between the two palaces. For Buckingham Palace, they made that early decision
*27:06.680- 27:11.880* :  to go quite public with details of King Charles' condition, although they haven't told us exactly
*27:11.880- 27:16.340* :  what cancer he has. So there is still quite an important piece of information that is being held
*27:16.340- 27:20.900* :  back. But I think the difference in terms of Buckingham Palace is that King Charles is the monarch,
*27:21.460- 27:27.140* :  his constitutional duties that he is still trying to fulfil to a degree, and they want the public
*27:27.140- 27:31.980* :  to see him doing that work. The palace, Buckingham Palace, want to show him at work.
*27:32.620- 27:36.480* :  There isn't that same pressure on the Princess of Wales. She doesn't have that constitutional
*27:36.480- 27:41.360* :  pressure to show that she's doing something. And her team are very focused on her privacy,
*27:41.360- 27:46.140* :  because that day that we see her again for the very first time, carrying out a royal engagement
*27:46.140- 27:51.060* :  will be a day of intense scrutiny, and they don't want to put her out in the public spotlight
*27:51.060- 27:57.800* :  until she's totally ready. Daniela Ralph. As we record exit polls in Portugal's election
*27:57.800- 28:02.360* :  are predicting a victory for the opposition centre-right democratic alliance.
*28:03.060- 28:09.100* :  Issues dominating the campaign included a crippling housing crisis, low wages and struggling
*28:09.100- 28:15.200* :  healthcare. Alison Roberts is in Lisbon. According to one exit poll, the alliance may have secured as
*28:15.200- 28:19.580* :  much as four percentage points more of the vote than the Socialists, while another put them all
*28:19.580- 28:24.300* :  but neck and neck. Either way, it's a big turn around from two years ago, but not enough to give
*28:24.300- 28:29.240* :  the alliance a majority in Parliament. Its leader, Luis Montenegro, has publicly ruled out doing
*28:29.240- 28:34.140* :  deals with far-right shaggy, which has more than doubled its vote. Portugal's long-serving
*28:34.140- 28:38.960* :  president, Marcelo Rabelada, says he's to call all parties with seats in for talks, one by one
*28:38.960- 28:43.180* :  in the coming days. With the rise of the far-right and major focus during the campaign,
*28:43.180- 28:48.460* :  votive participation was several percentage points up on the last two legislative elections.
*28:49.420- 28:55.960* :  Alison Roberts. And finally, a sweetener. Let's end this podcast on the pure pleasure of
*28:55.960- 29:01.660* :  chocolate, as depicted in the film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The film has a chocolate
*29:01.660- 29:07.880* :  waterfall and river, and the eccentric Willy Wonka reveals his world view, one of a planet
*29:08.240- 29:14.300* :  dominated by chocolate. Now, one politician in Australia has been channeling this energy,
*29:14.580- 29:19.800* :  declaring that if he's reelected later this month, he will build the world's largest
*29:19.800- 29:24.840* :  chocolate fountain. For more on this grand plan, here's Stephanie Prentice.
*29:25.720- 29:30.300* :  It really has it all. We've got excited Tasmanian Liberal politicians. We've got a budget
*29:30.300- 29:36.920* :  of millions of dollars, and we've got dreams of rivers of molten chocolate. So what is this? Well,
*29:36.920- 29:41.240* :  Jeremy Rockliffe, he's the current premier of Tasmania, a place where there's already this
*29:41.640- 29:46.040* :  huge, cabri-chocolate factory. Actually, it's the largest in the southern hemisphere, so
*29:46.580- 29:51.400* :  in many ways, already the Willy Wonka of Australia. And perhaps inspired by those
*29:51.400- 29:55.680* :  waterfalls of chocolate inside the factory in the Royal Dahl, Willy Wonka Universe,
*29:55.680- 30:01.780* :  he has a vision of a monumental chocolate fountain which spirals down the length of the room
*30:01.780- 30:08.380* :  and puddles at the bottom. So this vision, yes, there are autistic images already, is huge glass
*30:08.380- 30:13.920* :  windows overlooking the water with this giant chocolate fountain cascading away in the background.
*30:13.920- 30:18.960* :  He says it's going to draw tourism all around the world's Tasmania to experience his new
*30:18.960- 30:24.520* :  chocolate wonderland and become part of the must-see things to do there, which he lists as
*30:24.840- 30:30.320* :  hugging a Tasmanian devil, friendlier than they sound, sipping wine and climbing cradle mountain,
*30:30.320- 30:34.100* :  and we know that driving tourism is a key part of his plans for the island.
*30:34.680- 30:39.600* :  How feasible is this grand plan? Well, the current largest fountain is in,
*30:39.600- 30:44.820* :  actually have a guess, where do you think it is? I would guess the United States, am I right?
*30:45.040- 30:49.780* :  I would have, it's actually in Austria, in the north, in this very fancy chocolate shop in
*30:49.780- 30:54.820* :  museum, it's called the Comfortery Wenshitz, and it's 40 feet tall. So what's that?
*30:54.960- 31:01.360* :  Storyhouse. It's pretty big, that one is quite artistic. You can't actually eat it though,
*31:01.360- 31:06.720* :  it's kind of there for vibes only. Whereas Jeremy Rockcliff's plan seems a bit more fun.
*31:06.720- 31:11.680* :  He wants his fountain to sit alongside a new chocolate lab and play ground where people can
*31:11.980- 31:17.560* :  make their own bars, they can interact with the chocolate. Now, his big stumbling block in
*31:17.560- 31:22.680* :  getting this done might be that some have said his vast budget could be used elsewhere for things
*31:22.680- 31:28.680* :  like healthcare. I mean, the initial pledge is $12 million. It could go up to $100 million if the
*31:28.680- 31:34.140* :  huge expansion happens. But much like Willy Wonka before him, who, as you remember from the book,
*31:34.140- 31:38.680* :  had little care for the outside world and things like even workers rights or child safety.
*31:38.680- 31:44.440* :  Jeremy Rockcliff is determined. He says the fountain will create jobs, boost the economy,
*31:44.440- 31:49.920* :  and he's also spoken quite passionately about the absolute joy of touring the old Cadbury factory
*31:49.920- 31:53.480* :  and coming home with pockets full of chocolates. So as political statements go,
*31:54.020- 31:58.000* :  that one is pretty hard for anyone to disagree with. What happens if children fall in?
*31:58.560- 32:03.940* :  I think that's up to Jeremy. Stephanie Prentice talking there to Alex Ritzon.
