*01:39.840- 01:42.980* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:44.560- 01:49.280* :  I'm Jeanette Gillil and a 14 hours GMT on Wednesday the 6th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:49.820- 01:52.880* :  Joe Biden and Donald Trump sweep to victory on Super Tuesday,
*01:52.880- 01:56.900* :  but it's all over for the Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley.
*01:57.820- 02:01.920* :  Yulia Navalnya, the widow of the Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny,
*02:02.180- 02:06.280* :  calls for an election day protest against President Vladimir Putin.
*02:07.340- 02:13.320* :  The World Food Programme says the war in Sudan could trigger the world's largest hunger crisis.
*02:16.680- 02:22.600* :  Also in this podcast, a call to dispense with touch screens in cars and go back to buttons for
*02:22.600- 02:25.100* :  reasons of safety. And...
*02:28.700- 02:34.580* :  Even if one or two of the kids that play on the instruments that I repaired go on to great things,
*02:35.140- 02:41.600* :  it's just so worth it. The L.A. repair shop fixing musical instruments for free.
*02:46.480- 02:52.080* :  As we record this podcast, Donald Trump is on the brink of securing the Republican presidential
*02:52.080- 02:58.040* :  nomination, having cruised to victory in nearly all the state primaries held on Super Tuesday.
*02:58.040- 03:02.100* :  The biggest voting day in the US ahead of the presidential election itself.
*03:02.780- 03:07.540* :  His only Republican rival, Nikki Haley, is now reported to be preparing to pull out.
*03:08.400- 03:13.960* :  So it now looks like a rematch between Mr. Trump and President Joe Biden is almost inevitable.
*03:14.780- 03:20.260* :  Yet opinion polls suggest most Americans are unhappy about the choice they'll have to make in November,
*03:20.600- 03:21.840* :  as Will Vernon reports.
*03:26.220- 03:27.820* :  Another triumph for Trump.
*03:28.260- 03:36.440* :  The former president swept the board on Super Tuesday, securing his position as the
*03:36.440- 03:42.420* :  unassailable front runner. At a rally in Florida, Mr. Trump said his victory was historic.
*03:43.160- 03:49.120* :  Well, thank you very much. They call it Super Tuesday for a reason. This is a big one.
*03:51.100- 03:55.460* :  And they tell me the pundits and otherwise that there's never been one like this,
*03:55.460- 03:58.280* :  has never been anything so conclusive.
*03:58.280- 04:03.320* :  Check that former president Trump has won the state of Texas for president will win
*04:03.320- 04:08.200* :  the state of Massachusetts and officially he hasn't won the nomination yet.
*04:08.840- 04:12.540* :  But with results like these, total victory seems certain.
*04:13.080- 04:15.260* :  Super Tuesday or snoozer Tuesday.
*04:15.660- 04:19.040* :  President Joe Biden also swept the board in the Democrat primaries.
*04:19.880- 04:23.680* :  Here in Washington, the Super Tuesday atmosphere compared to previous years
*04:23.680- 04:30.140* :  is rather flat. As expected, Joe Biden and Donald Trump have swept the board and are now
*04:30.140- 04:33.620* :  almost certain to be going head-to-head in the election come November.
*04:33.620- 04:36.980* :  If all of this seems familiar, well that's because it is.
*04:37.580- 04:41.200* :  Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden faced off in the 2020 election too.
*04:41.820- 04:44.880* :  It's a rematch that most people here just don't want.
*04:54.100- 04:58.400* :  It's become polarizing. I wish that people would focus more on what we have in common
*04:58.560- 05:01.700* :  because I think there's so much more that we have in common than different.
*05:02.520- 05:08.480* :  A man indicted on 91 charges across four criminal cases versus the oldest sitting president
*05:08.480- 05:12.280* :  in history who faces questions about his mental fitness for office.
*05:12.880- 05:18.020* :  Around 70% of Americans say they don't want another Trump versus Biden election.
*05:18.720- 05:22.800* :  Donald Trump has greater intent to the people who love him and hate him.
*05:22.800- 05:26.560* :  Frank Luntz is a Republican poster and political consultant.
*05:27.300- 05:34.520* :  Joe Biden is not quite as intense but you either support Joe Biden to prevent Donald Trump from
*05:34.960- 05:39.620* :  becoming president or you oppose Joe Biden because you want Donald Trump to become president.
*05:40.480- 05:46.940* :  I've never seen politics so toxic and frankly dangerous
*05:47.820- 05:51.600* :  this early in a presidential campaign in my entire professional life.
*05:56.820- 06:03.120* :  Donald Trump has a small lead over Joe Biden in most polls but election day is still eight months away
*06:03.440- 06:08.880* :  and many Americans already seem weary of the campaign and of an increasingly polarized
*06:09.460- 06:10.280* :  political climate.
*06:14.260- 06:18.840* :  Will Vernon, well much of the focus is now turning on to whether Nikki Haley will throw
*06:18.840- 06:23.600* :  her support behind Mr. Trump. With more on her campaign, here's another one of our
*06:23.600- 06:31.180* :  correspondence in Washington, Anthony Zirker. She lost 14 to the 15 state contests last night
*06:31.180- 06:36.980* :  on Super Tuesday and mathematically the numbers were just becoming incredibly daunting.
*06:36.980- 06:42.240* :  Donald Trump was just a few hundred delegates away from securing the nomination no matter what
*06:42.240- 06:47.640* :  Nikki Haley did. He probably would reach that mark next week. So the writing was on the wall
*06:47.640- 06:52.480* :  and she had accomplished what she sought to do in Super Tuesday which was stay there and give
*06:52.480- 06:58.060* :  a lot of voters in America an option but it was difficult to imagine her getting continued
*06:58.060- 07:03.640* :  financial support to keep her campaign going or even why she would want to for the remaining
*07:03.640- 07:07.700* :  states that dribble out over the next couple of months. And she's expected to speak in the next
*07:07.700- 07:13.240* :  couple of hours and a key question will be is she going to endorse Donald Trump now that he's
*07:13.240- 07:19.920* :  a sole Republican candidate because he really doesn't need to extend his appeal beyond his very loyal
*07:19.920- 07:25.040* :  base. That is the key question and reports at least as of now are that she will not
*07:25.040- 07:30.940* :  announce an endorsement for Donald Trump in this speech later this morning from her home of Charleston,
*07:30.940- 07:36.700* :  South Carolina that she will say that Donald Trump needs to do more to reach out to her voters
*07:36.700- 07:42.960* :  and convince them to support him. It is going to be an interesting test to see if Donald Trump could
*07:42.960- 07:47.840* :  do that. If you look at exit polls from several of the states that voted last night there were large
*07:47.840- 07:55.240* :  segments of Nikki Haley's support that appear reluctant to support Donald Trump. And now while
*07:55.240- 07:59.260* :  back in 2016 there were certainly Republican voters who didn't vote for Donald Trump and then came
*07:59.260- 08:04.220* :  around and supported him back then. That does mean that Donald Trump is going to have some work to
*08:04.220- 08:09.320* :  do to broaden his base because he's going to need those Nikki Haley supporters which are college
*08:09.320- 08:16.860* :  educated voters, suburban voters, wealthier voters in order to build a coalition that can win the
*08:16.860- 08:23.360* :  White House Forum in November. But a lot of people in the US are really not very excited by this
*08:23.360- 08:27.960* :  result. They think they've got eight months of an angry divisive campaign. And a lot of people
*08:27.960- 08:34.740* :  will be going, oh no, not again, Biden versus Trump. The polls do indicate that many Americans,
*08:34.740- 08:40.100* :  majority of Americans don't want this match up. Certainly don't want to rematch. They want someone
*08:40.100- 08:46.760* :  younger. They want someone who might be able to run a more energetic optimistic campaign. But as
*08:46.760- 08:50.960* :  you mentioned, that is not the campaign we're going to get. We're going to get eight months of
*08:50.960- 08:56.600* :  both candidates predicting doom and gloom if their opponent wins. And I think you're going to see
*08:57.000- 09:00.960* :  a general election campaign where both candidates are hopping around the map to key swing states
*09:01.940- 09:06.620* :  making campaign appearances like they both did in Texas last week and they are both going to do
*09:07.040- 09:11.780* :  in Georgia, which is definitely a swing state on Saturday. This is going to feel like a very,
*09:11.780- 09:18.400* :  very long campaign because they are already focused on each other and they are going to go dark and
*09:18.400- 09:25.280* :  negative very quickly. Anthony Zurker. Alexey Navalny's widow has urged Russians to treat this
*09:25.320- 09:30.820* :  month's presidential election as an opportunity to protest against Vladimir Putin.
*09:31.720- 09:37.300* :  Julian Navalny called the election a sham which would end in whatever result Mr Putin wanted.
*09:38.340- 09:42.360* :  She has vowed to take up the mantle of her dead husband. He was a leading opposition
*09:42.360- 09:48.000* :  voice in Russia despite only narrowly escaping an assassination attempt and then being imprisoned
*09:48.000- 09:53.300* :  for years. His supporters have pinned the blame for his sudden death in a penal colony last
*09:53.300- 09:57.580* :  month on Mr Putin. Here's our Europe regional editor, Alice Adely.
*09:58.300- 10:04.920* :  Julian Navalny who lives in exile has issued a call on YouTube to compatriots to come out
*10:04.920- 10:10.700* :  in force to register their opposition to President Putin in the elections later this month,
*10:10.700- 10:16.320* :  the result of which most observers believe is a foregone conclusion, his reelection.
*10:16.860- 10:22.180* :  Many commentators do not expect the election to be either free or fair. Instead they say the
*10:22.180- 10:27.600* :  process will be dominated by Mr Putin who's been accused of increasing political repression
*10:27.600- 10:34.660* :  ever since launching his full-scale war with Ukraine in 2022. When Mr Navalny died in mysterious
*10:34.660- 10:41.140* :  circumstances in a penal colony in northern Russia in mid-February, Vladimir Putin's main opponent
*10:41.140- 10:47.480* :  was wiped away even though he had already been barred from standing. For several days in Moscow
*10:47.480- 10:52.940* :  last week, thousands of people visited his grave to lay flowers and to pay their respects.
*10:52.980- 11:00.000* :  His widow, Julia, said she had drawn hope from the large crowds. She urged people to go to polling
*11:00.000- 11:05.420* :  stations and send a clear message to President Putin about the opposition to his rule.
*11:05.420- 11:13.580* :  We can still use that so-called election to achieve our goals. We need to show that we exist
*11:13.580- 11:18.620* :  and that there are many of us. We need to go to polling stations on the same day and time
*11:18.620- 11:25.000* :  noon of March 17th. It is up to you to choose what to do next. You can vote for any candidate but
*11:25.000- 11:29.900* :  Putin. You can spoil the ballot. You can write on it in big letters, Navalny.
*11:30.560- 11:37.180* :  Julia Navalny has called for her late husband's supporters to come to polling stations at mid-day
*11:37.180- 11:42.840* :  on the last of three days of voting could potentially result in their detention or worse.
*11:42.840- 11:48.520* :  There were almost no arrests at Alexei Navalny's funeral, but it's always a possibility
*11:48.520- 11:52.600* :  in Russia's increasingly repressive political environment.
*11:53.780- 11:54.560* :  Alice Adely
*11:55.860- 12:00.280* :  While the eyes of the world have been focused on Gaza for weeks now, the UN World Food
*12:00.280- 12:06.360* :  Programme has been warning of an unfolding catastrophe in Sudan. As warring factions battle
*12:06.360- 12:11.520* :  for control of the country, the WFPE says it's been receiving reports that people are dying
*12:11.520- 12:18.220* :  of starvation in Sudan and that millions more are facing acute hunger. It's extremely difficult
*12:18.220- 12:23.260* :  for aid agencies to get into Sudan where vast swaves of the population have been displaced.
*12:24.100- 12:27.700* :  Many have crossed the border into South Sudan to try to escape the violence.
*12:27.780- 12:33.840* :  Speaking on a visit to a transit camp at Rankin, South Sudan, the head of the WFP, Cindy McCain,
*12:34.540- 12:37.340* :  issued this statement on the UN Organization's website.
*12:38.260- 12:43.840* :  The war in Sudan is sending millions spiraling into what can soon be the world's largest hunger
*12:43.840- 12:50.300* :  crisis. In South Sudan, I've met mothers and children who have fled violence many times.
*12:51.220- 12:55.120* :  They've escaped the fighting, but they struggle to escape the hunger.
*12:56.180- 13:01.060* :  Our deputy Africa editor, Ansoy, is monitoring the situation in Sudan from Nairobi.
*13:01.940- 13:08.380* :  The World Food Programme is estimating that about 25 million people both inside Sudan and
*13:08.400- 13:15.720* :  those who have fled to neighboring countries are facing food insecurity and the situation is
*13:15.720- 13:22.660* :  getting worse by the day. They have warned that many people are at risk of going into the highest
*13:22.660- 13:29.240* :  level of hunger. They call it a hunger catastrophe unless something is done. In the long term,
*13:29.300- 13:34.360* :  they think that what would have a lasting solution was to end the war, but there's no end in
*13:34.360- 13:41.020* :  sight to the war that has been raging since last April between the two rival forces in Sudan.
*13:41.340- 13:48.060* :  Is there any kind of outside mediation because I seem to remember that a US envoy was recently
*13:48.060- 13:55.060* :  appointed? That's right. There has been a concerted effort to bring the warring sides together,
*13:56.020- 14:02.920* :  both by the regional governments in the whole of Africa, as well as Arab states. There have been
*14:04.180- 14:10.820* :  efforts supported by Western nations, including the United States, but so far they have
*14:10.820- 14:19.460* :  famed to yield a lasting solution. Just days ago, the leaders of this warring sides have been
*14:19.460- 14:26.800* :  hosted in Libya, in the Tripoli-based government, and so there are multiple efforts to try and find
*14:26.800- 14:35.320* :  a solution, but none inside yet. Our cars becoming far too minimalist for their own good. A lot of
*14:35.320- 14:40.280* :  new models have fancy touch screens, but some in the industry are worried they aren't as safe as
*14:40.280- 14:46.060* :  using old-fashioned buttons. Now, a European safety body is introducing new guidance that will
*14:46.060- 14:52.720* :  require cars to have physical controls to receive a five-star safety rating. Tim Frank spoke to
*14:52.720- 14:59.240* :  the motoring journalist, Ginny Buckley. EuroMCAP, who are the automotive safety industry body in
*14:59.240- 15:05.420* :  Europe, is introducing new guidance from 2026. And what this is basically saying is that five,
*15:05.420- 15:11.340* :  what they consider key tasks in every car will have to be performed by actually using an actual
*15:11.340- 15:17.880* :  button or a stalk or a dial. And those tasks are indicators hazard warning lights, windscreen
*15:17.880- 15:24.420* :  wipers, the horn and some SOS features. And I guess this is all down to something called the
*15:24.420- 15:29.640* :  rise of the touchscreen, which seems to be in every single car we see these days. It is proliferating,
*15:29.640- 15:36.660* :  isn't it? Has it got to the point with new cars where there is a sense of, you know, actually
*15:36.660- 15:41.580* :  there aren't any buttons. I mean, it is all touchscreen. So has it reached that point yet?
*15:41.920- 15:47.160* :  Yeah, it has reached saturation point, I think, and indeed the latest car that we've seen from Volvo,
*15:47.160- 15:54.380* :  which is the Volvo EX-30, if you looked up Scandi minimalism, you know, one of those AI image
*15:54.380- 15:59.200* :  generators, you would see a picture of this car's interior because it has nothing. There is a screen
*15:59.200- 16:05.600* :  and a steering wheel. So you access everything through that. You were just the mirrors, you access
*16:05.600- 16:11.420* :  your demister, you adjust the steering wheel height. You even though need to go through two menus
*16:11.420- 16:17.260* :  to turn on the fog lights. So this is where I think it's getting slightly ridiculous. I mean,
*16:17.260- 16:21.380* :  I personally really like these big infotainment screens. I think that can be very useful,
*16:21.380- 16:26.660* :  but I do want to see physical buttons in the car for those key functions. And I actually don't
*16:26.660- 16:31.440* :  think you're in cap of gunfire enough. I think we should see physical buttons being mandatory.
*16:31.440- 16:35.800* :  For things like controlling your climate control, the volume on your car,
*16:36.300- 16:39.260* :  there's the things you do a lot when you're driving and it should be easy to do.
*16:39.580- 16:45.200* :  It might seem like a wearingly obvious point, but it clearly needs to be made is that, you know,
*16:45.200- 16:51.300* :  these are decisions that and sort of maneuvers and changes that people are trying to make when they
*16:51.300- 16:57.420* :  are driving a ton of metal at high speed. I mean, you really need to be able to do this with the
*16:57.420- 17:02.700* :  minimum amount of fuss and looking away from the road. Yeah, indeed, it's a really good point
*17:02.700- 17:08.980* :  and in fact road safety campaigns are concerned that rises that we've seen in accidents are perhaps
*17:08.980- 17:14.080* :  down to people just glancing away to look at touch screens. I think what the car makers would say
*17:14.080- 17:19.780* :  and certainly in the case of Volvo is they've got a very good voice activation system. So if you can
*17:19.780- 17:23.900* :  really get on with that and it's a system that really understands what you're saying, you know,
*17:23.900- 17:27.800* :  sometimes being northern on certain words, they don't always understand what I'm saying.
*17:28.320- 17:33.280* :  But if you have a good voice activation system, then it should take away that need to stab away
*17:33.280- 17:37.560* :  in a menu, looking for things. But I really do think, as you say, some of those key functions,
*17:37.560- 17:41.500* :  the things you're using all the time, they should be there, you know, at your fingertips.
*17:41.960- 17:48.080* :  Given those concerns, why do you think car designers, car makers are going down this route?
*17:48.460- 17:53.280* :  So I think there's a couple of reasons playing into this. One is it reduces the costs and the
*17:53.280- 17:58.320* :  second is it can reduce emissions. So first of all, we look at costs, the less parts you have to
*17:58.320- 18:02.760* :  manufacture for a car, the more you can keep the cost down. And we know that particularly with
*18:02.760- 18:07.120* :  electric cars at the moment, they are a premium over their petrol and diesel counterparts, so that's
*18:07.120- 18:12.840* :  a good thing. The second thing though is carbon emissions. So manufacturers really need to look at
*18:12.840- 18:17.880* :  the overall emissions of a car made during its lifetime. So that includes the manufacturing and
*18:17.880- 18:23.120* :  the supply chain, not just those emissions that it may or may not emit as it dries down the road.
*18:23.960- 18:29.200* :  So by again, reducing those parts, you can reduce the overall emissions. In fact, we've
*18:29.200- 18:33.540* :  seen a really interesting thing recently. It's not actually, you know, doing away with switches
*18:33.540- 18:38.980* :  and buttons, it's doing away with a windscreen. So the new car from Polestar, the Polestar 4,
*18:38.980- 18:44.140* :  doesn't have a rear window in that car. You know, they've done it for a number of reasons.
*18:44.140- 18:49.220* :  There are fantastic cameras in there that take the place of that windscreen. But by reducing
*18:49.220- 18:55.840* :  that very heavy part, it's helping to reduce that car's emissions. Motoring journalist, Ginny Buckley.
*18:59.240- 19:03.840* :  Still to come on this podcast, Haiti's gangs tighten their grip on the country and
*19:03.920- 19:08.940* :  they look to me a bit like the sort of lights that you might put on a bicycle. So obviously,
*19:09.320- 19:14.120* :  you wouldn't go out at night without lights on your bicycle. And this is doing a similar sort of
*19:14.140- 19:19.680* :  thing. A bright idea to save thousands of sea turtles from being killed by fishing nets,

*21:05.080- 21:09.960* :  podcast. Welcome back to the Global News podcast. Let's turn to Nigeria now, where dozens of
*21:09.960- 21:15.560* :  displaced people have been abducted by suspected Boko Haram-Jihadists in the northeastern state of
*21:15.580- 21:20.740* :  Borno. Officials say the victims, most of them female, were seized when they were collecting
*21:20.740- 21:26.980* :  firewood in a forest. Mayany Jones reports from Lagos. There are lots of conflicting reports
*21:26.980- 21:32.480* :  about what exactly happened in Ingala this weekend. Even the day the victims were taken is
*21:32.480- 21:37.520* :  contested, with sources in the area disagreeing on whether it happened Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
*21:38.200- 21:43.180* :  What we know is that a number of internally displaced people from a camp in Ingala near the border
*21:43.180- 21:48.140* :  with Cameroon were abducted. Most appear to have been women and girls who were collecting firewood
*21:48.140- 21:54.880* :  to sell and use for cooking. Local militia leaders told the AFP news agency only 47 women are still missing.
*21:55.520- 21:59.060* :  The authorities in Borno states have not yet confirmed the number of abductees.
*21:59.060- 22:05.940* :  The incident comes as the government of Borno in Norfis, Nigeria, said that 95% of Boko Haram fighters
*22:05.940- 22:11.000* :  were either dead or had surrendered to the authorities. For over a decade, Islamist
*22:11.000- 22:16.280* :  insurgents have carried out attacks and mass abductions in northern Nigeria, killing more than 40,000
*22:16.280- 22:22.660* :  people and displacing 2 million. Mayany Jones, one of Haiti's most powerful gang leaders, Jimmy
*22:22.820- 22:29.360* :  who is known as Barbecue has said there will be civil war if Ariel Henri does not step down as
*22:29.360- 22:34.300* :  Prime Minister. Mr Henri, who had been in Kenya, trying to secure a multinational police force,
*22:34.300- 22:40.600* :  is currently said to be in Puerto Rico after gangs attack the international airport to prevent him
*22:40.600- 22:46.280* :  returning home. Barbecue said he would stop at nothing to prevent the Prime Minister coming back.
*22:50.500- 22:56.740* :  We will fight Ariel Henri until the last drop of blood. We will fight Ariel Henri until he
*22:56.740- 23:02.380* :  resigns. I am ready to make an alliance with the devil, ready to sleep in the same bed as the devil.
*23:03.540- 23:07.860* :  Nick Miles spoke to our correspondent in the region, Will Grant, about the influence of the armed
*23:07.860- 23:14.360* :  gangs. They really are in control of the vast majority of Porta Prince at the moment. It said that
*23:14.360- 23:20.460* :  it is over 80% of the city they control. We have seen that they have launched attacks on the
*23:20.460- 23:26.720* :  international airport. Of course, there was the shocking storming of prisons, seeing somewhere
*23:26.720- 23:33.720* :  in the region of 4,000 inmates flee and escape from prison. They are very, very powerful, very
*23:33.720- 23:40.300* :  well armed. Even if it was not such a chaotic situation, almost a political vacuum going on,
*23:40.740- 23:44.840* :  I think the authorities would struggle to contain them in the best of times, and this is far
*23:44.840- 23:49.880* :  from the best of times. Will are these gangs working together with a common aim in mind,
*23:49.880- 23:55.480* :  or are they just out for whatever they can get from the situation? What do they want?
*23:56.280- 24:02.600* :  Jimmy Chaudy's gang is really a coalition of gangs. It's called G9 and it is several different
*24:02.800- 24:08.020* :  large groups and very, very powerful ones at that. But it does seem that some of the other groups
*24:08.020- 24:14.740* :  are similarly lined up against Adielandri that he faces Anarchy really a collective sense
*24:14.740- 24:21.280* :  led by the gang world against his rule. Of course, there is not just him and his supporters who
*24:21.280- 24:26.140* :  oppose that and people who want some form of stability, even if it is with the unelected
*24:26.140- 24:31.400* :  prime minister until they can hold elections, but certainly Washington backs Adielandri. So,
*24:31.400- 24:36.140* :  yeah, that's a very, very difficult and violent situation. And Mr. Ongry was actually out of the
*24:36.140- 24:40.300* :  country when all this happened. He'd been in Kenya signing a deal with the government there
*24:40.800- 24:45.400* :  to bring in a thousand Kenyan police to help with the overall security situation.
*24:46.240- 24:50.600* :  From the outside, it seems unlikely, though, that even if they are forthcoming,
*24:50.600- 24:56.640* :  a thousand new Kenyan police against these gangs, would it make an awful lot of difference?
*24:57.640- 25:00.320* :  I mean, I don't think it's much of an exaggeration to say that Haiti is now
*25:00.320- 25:04.900* :  teased ring on the edge of becoming a failed state. So, in that sense, no, a thousand police
*25:04.900- 25:09.360* :  officers from Kenya, or really from anywhere else in the world, is unlikely to make that much
*25:09.360- 25:13.600* :  difference. That said, I think it's the sense that this would be an international force
*25:13.600- 25:17.660* :  backed by the United Nations with the support of the United States with some funding,
*25:18.180- 25:22.140* :  and that might have more clout to it than simply a thousand officers on their own in the middle
*25:22.140- 25:27.840* :  of the Maustrum. Nevertheless, yeah, it remains extremely chaotic, extremely violent, and even that
*25:27.840- 25:31.420* :  situation with the Kenya police officers can't get off the ground because it's been deemed
*25:31.420- 25:36.080* :  unconstitutional by Kenya's top court. And briefly, well, in the middle of all this,
*25:36.080- 25:39.100* :  are the people trying to get by? It's awful for them, isn't it?
*25:39.400- 25:43.080* :  It is, and that's the thing that one keeps coming back to, you know, that this is school shut
*25:43.080- 25:48.060* :  down, businesses shutted, and of course, looting going on in neighborhoods and gangs roaming
*25:48.060- 25:52.780* :  the street with absolute impunity and total control, yes, it's horrific for those involved.
*25:54.040- 25:59.180* :  We'll grant. Tens of thousands of sea turtles die every year in the Mediterranean sea after
*25:59.180- 26:03.920* :  becoming entangled in fishing nets, but a new study has come up with a solution,
*26:04.180- 26:09.200* :  putting green flashing lights on the nets. Researchers from the project, which involved the
*26:09.260- 26:14.600* :  society for the protection of turtles and Cypriot fishermen as well, say the battery-powered
*26:14.600- 26:20.680* :  devices make up the number of accidental catches and deaths by as much as half.
*26:21.240- 26:24.080* :  Our environment correspondent Helen Briggs told us more.
*26:24.780- 26:29.380* :  They look to me a bit like the sort of lights that you might put on a bicycle. So obviously,
*26:29.380- 26:34.540* :  you wouldn't go out at night without lights on your bicycle. And this is doing a similar sort of
*26:34.560- 26:41.700* :  thing, but you're attaching the lights to fishing ropes. And the idea really is to warn off sea
*26:41.740- 26:46.500* :  turtles. We've got a lot of sea turtles in the Mediterranean sea. It's an important breeding
*26:46.500- 26:52.660* :  ground for green turtles, for loggerhead turtles. So the idea is if you can use these lights and
*26:52.660- 26:57.700* :  attach them to fishing ropes, then you can reduce the number of accidental catches. So there has
*26:57.700- 27:04.720* :  been some work before on this with lights. And this particular design was done by an English company
*27:04.720- 27:11.440* :  developed by two brothers, one's an engineer, one's a biologist, and they want to try and get these
*27:11.440- 27:18.180* :  lights used more widely. They're quite cheap to use. They just rely on batteries. So it's quite
*27:18.180- 27:24.980* :  low tech. And the first trials of the coast of North Cyprus do seem to be producing some promising
*27:24.980- 27:31.400* :  results. So it seems that you can almost have accidental catching of sea turtles.
*27:32.240- 27:38.260* :  Yes, because I think there is one figure saying that as many as 40,000 turtles die every year in
*27:38.260- 27:44.060* :  the Mediterranean because they get entangled in fishing lines. But how would this work when it comes
*27:44.060- 27:49.140* :  to the fish themselves? Because clearly the fishermen want to catch fish. So did these lights
*27:49.140- 27:54.440* :  not work with fishes? They don't see the lights. Well, these first studies, it seems that it doesn't
*27:54.440- 28:00.360* :  actually have any effect on the commercial fishes that they're targeting. It's this accidental
*28:00.460- 28:05.780* :  bycatch as we call it. It's an accidental entanglement of species that you're not trying to catch,
*28:06.140- 28:13.680* :  but they get caught up too, that they seem to be protecting. So in these studies, no marine mammals,
*28:13.700- 28:20.580* :  sharks or sea birds were caught. So that's promising. But to put this into context, these turtles are
*28:20.580- 28:25.440* :  facing a lot of hazards in the Mediterranean Sea. This is a big problem for them. So this is where a
*28:25.440- 28:31.100* :  lot of conservation efforts are going into preventing bycatch. But a lot of other workers need it as
*28:31.120- 28:35.860* :  well. It's very busy oceans, there's shipping, there's development, there's pollution,
*28:35.860- 28:43.300* :  there's degradation of the beaches where they nest. So it's one part of conservation work to try and
*28:43.300- 28:48.720* :  protect sea turtles. And if you can protect skates and rays, they don't get as much attention,
*28:48.720- 28:53.720* :  maybe as sea turtles, but a lot of them are under threat of extinction. At the same time, there's
*28:53.720- 28:59.800* :  going to be more research into this area, I think. Helen Briggs, the Oscars will take place on Sunday,
*28:59.800- 29:05.080* :  and it's easy to forget there are categories beyond the blockbuster awards for best film actor
*29:05.080- 29:11.700* :  and director. One of the smaller categories is best documentary short. And among those nominated
*29:11.700- 29:18.360* :  this year is the last repair shop, about a small warehouse in Los Angeles where crafts people carry
*29:18.360- 29:24.260* :  out repairs on musical instruments for school kids, is directed by Ben Proudfoot and Chris Bauer's
*29:24.560- 29:30.040* :  and features Dwayne Michael, who's a musician in his own right and now repairs woodwind instruments
*29:30.040- 29:37.760* :  in the workshop. When producers Ben and Chris came to the shop, I was just one of the four of that
*29:37.760- 29:42.720* :  pretty much said, sure, I'd love to be a part of it. I was a nervous wreck the whole day.
*29:47.280- 29:55.220* :  I love the violin. The hardest things in my life is probably my family's health.
*29:56.200- 30:01.160* :  Everybody's always getting sick back to back. Even though I repair all, you know,
*30:01.160- 30:07.260* :  trumpets and get some string repair as well, but when I was hired on, I was hired on in the woodwind
*30:07.260- 30:13.980* :  section. That's the opening that was available. And of course, that's the saxophones and
*30:13.980- 30:20.680* :  flutes and clarinets and all the, you know, in that category. And I got my wonderful and enjoyable
*30:20.680- 30:27.380* :  bench that I sit at. I start working on the saxophones, clarinets, whatever happens to be on
*30:27.380- 30:33.480* :  on the list for that day. So that's kind of how the day starts for me. The saxophone helped me
*30:33.480- 30:40.380* :  in a way be more disciplined because music, okay, I have to be on time. I have to practice. I have
*30:40.380- 30:47.460* :  to look good. I have to shower and have to brush my teeth. It helped me focus more. I've always
*30:47.460- 30:52.540* :  been into tinkering with things. As a little kid, I remember the Legos and stuff. I would want to build.
*30:52.540- 30:58.380* :  I would want to make things work. And so I always had that interest. And even before the film,
*30:59.220- 31:05.240* :  we've always been like a family in there. Knowing that the instruments are going back to the
*31:05.940- 31:10.320* :  student, you can almost see in your mind, you know, when they get their instrument back,
*31:10.380- 31:16.840* :  they're going to be smiling and happy. And of course, we clean up the cases and we wipe everything
*31:16.840- 31:21.540* :  down and make the instrument look as nice as we can when they get it back. It's kind of a driving
*31:21.540- 31:28.360* :  force that at least personally that keeps me going. When I'm feeling tense, when I'm feeling sad
*31:28.360- 31:44.400* :  or angry, the saxophone comes me down. Even if one or two of the kids that play on the instruments
*31:44.400- 31:52.700* :  and I repair, go on to great things, you know, it's just so worth it. Even if these students don't
*31:52.700- 32:00.360* :  go on to be well-known players or musicians and maybe after school or college, they go on to other
*32:00.360- 32:06.580* :  things. It really helps you when you're young. I mean, I know it has helped me, even if I didn't
*32:06.580- 32:12.940* :  stick with it, it helped me to be more attentive to know what it's like to put in time and learn
*32:12.940- 32:19.920* :  something and get something out of it. I think that's what keeps me going and keeps me enjoying
*32:19.920- 32:36.760* :  the work that I do. We did a few days ago find out that the four of us press people, myself,
*32:36.820- 32:46.840* :  Dana, Patty and Steve, will be going to the Academy Awards and it's very surreal, very unbelievable,
*32:46.840- 32:56.900* :  but yes, we will be able to attend. I'm very grateful and nervous too in a good way, in a good way.
*32:58.200- 33:03.840* :  That was Jane Michael and the documentary is available for streaming on YouTube and the Los Angeles
*33:03.840- 33:10.800* :  Times website. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global
