*00:53.680- 00:58.860* :  women are living their best lives. We're here to shine a light on some surprising and inspiring
*00:58.860- 01:03.160* :  places and what we can learn from them. We'll have to be a woman from the BBC World Service.
*01:03.500- 01:05.900* :  Listen now, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*01:08.480- 01:11.820* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:13.960- 01:18.360* :  I'm Rachel Wright, and in the early hours of Friday, the 8th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:18.360- 01:22.060* :  We have the latest on-president Biden State of the Union Address,
*01:22.440- 01:26.980* :  gunman on motorbikes that reportedly sees more than 100 school children in Nigeria,
*01:27.400- 01:30.240* :  the country's second mass kidnapping in a matter of days.
*01:33.040- 01:38.700* :  Also, in this podcast, Haiti's main port has suspended all operations as violence escalates
*01:38.980- 01:44.100* :  and criminal gangs consolidate their grip on the capital. We get the latest in the Formula One
*01:44.100- 01:48.600* :  Red Bull Saga, and we head to Los Alamos, the town in New Mexico,
*01:49.060- 01:53.640* :  made famous by the film Oppenheimer, where people are dealing with a conflicted past.
*01:53.800- 02:01.100* :  It's really easy for us 75 years later to sit in self-righteous judgment of decisions that were made.
*02:03.580- 02:08.240* :  We started the United States where President Joe Biden has been delivering the state of the
*02:08.240- 02:13.920* :  Union Address, his my colleague Paul Moss, with the details. There were those who thought Joe Biden's
*02:13.920- 02:19.860* :  state of the Union Address might be weakly delivered, sounding tentative, proving what his critics say
*02:19.860- 02:25.080* :  that this is a man who's already too old for the job. Let alone in a state to hold office for
*02:25.080- 02:31.560* :  another four years. Well, Mr. Biden came out fighting, no preliminaries, no niceties to sugar the
*02:31.560- 02:37.240* :  speech. Instead, he launched a direct attack on the man, almost certain to be his opponent in the
*02:37.240- 02:42.820* :  forthcoming election. He didn't actually name Donald Trump, but suggested he was a threat to
*02:42.820- 02:48.900* :  democracy both at home in the U.S., and internationally for failing to stand up to Vladimir Putin.
*03:22.280- 03:28.420* :  Biden also criticized Donald Trump for his record on the economy. Under my watch, Mr. Biden claimed
*03:28.420- 03:34.800* :  the U.S. had become the envy of the world. And he had some sharp words for the Israeli government
*03:34.800- 03:40.900* :  with pro-Palestinian protesters outside the White House, and Democrats holding up pro-Palestinian
*03:40.900- 03:46.840* :  signs inside the chamber. He called for more protection to be given to help Palestinians' civilians.
*03:47.540- 03:52.740* :  For the leadership of the Israel, I say this, humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary
*03:53.500- 03:58.300* :  consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be priority.
*03:59.400- 04:05.620* :  As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time.
*04:08.000- 04:11.980* :  Well, along with all those gathered on Capitol Hill watching the speech was our correspondent in
*04:11.980- 04:17.420* :  Washington, Will Vernon, and he joins me now. Well, I said Joe Biden was in this sort of
*04:17.420- 04:22.440* :  combative mood. I thought really more like an election campaign speech than a presidential
*04:22.440- 04:27.920* :  address. Do you think he did enough to disprove those who think that he is too old and frail for
*04:27.920- 04:33.720* :  the job? Well, Paul, I think White House staff as lungs will be emptied of all oxygen tonight
*04:34.480- 04:39.160* :  as they heave a huge sigh of relief over this performance. No major slip-ups, no stumbles,
*04:39.620- 04:45.740* :  as we know Mr. Biden's age is a huge issue in this election. And I think in terms of the
*04:45.740- 04:50.660* :  perception of his age, this was a fairly good performance. His delivery was very energized,
*04:50.660- 04:55.560* :  even aggressive, you might say. During the section of his speech on NATO and Ukraine, he practically
*04:55.560- 05:01.220* :  bellowed from the lectern. My message to President Putin is, we will not walk away, I will not
*05:01.220- 05:06.040* :  bow down. I thought that was a very powerful moment actually. And it was almost right at the
*05:06.040- 05:09.960* :  beginning, very punchy thought I thought to his speech. But you're right in that this was
*05:10.340- 05:16.120* :  one of the most campaign-focused state of the Union speeches. Most people can remember lots of
*05:16.120- 05:21.500* :  swipes at Donald Trump, really looking to draw a sharp contrast between him and the former
*05:21.500- 05:26.740* :  President. He took aim at Mr. Trump over January the 6th over abortion, immigration, his
*05:26.740- 05:31.460* :  attitude to Putin, I mean the list went on almost everything. Mr. Biden mentioned was brought
*05:31.460- 05:37.340* :  back to Donald Trump. And that's because Polling shows us that extolling the virtues of any
*05:37.340- 05:42.840* :  achievements under Mr. Biden's administration isn't really working with voters. But what does
*05:42.840- 05:48.800* :  appear to work is playing on many people's fears about a return of Donald Trump to the White House.
*05:49.300- 05:53.580* :  One thing that wasn't about Donald Trump though is that call to Israel to do more to protect
*05:53.580- 06:00.120* :  Palestinians civilians. Do I detect a bit of a change of tone from the US dance which we've
*06:00.120- 06:04.440* :  seen over the past few months? Well, we've had a change of tone for a while now, really. There
*06:04.440- 06:11.080* :  have been increasing hints of frustration in public statements from Mr. Biden and other US officials
*06:11.080- 06:15.560* :  for many weeks now. Joe Biden said, didn't hear a few weeks ago that the military offensive,
*06:15.560- 06:20.980* :  the Israeli offensive in Gaza is over the top. He said, Washington wouldn't support any operation
*06:20.980- 06:26.060* :  in the city of Raffa without proper planning. And most recently, Joe Biden himself called for
*06:26.060- 06:31.280* :  an immediate ceasefire. In the speech tonight, he described the war in Gaza as gut wrenching.
*06:31.820- 06:37.180* :  And Rashida Talib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, was actually crying in the chamber
*06:37.180- 06:43.560* :  as Biden described the suffering. And he announced, didn't he, additional measures on aid access
*06:43.560- 06:49.260* :  to Gaza. And I think he'll be hoping to appease many Democrat voters, large numbers of whom
*06:49.800- 06:54.540* :  are unhappy about his stance on Israel. And we've seen this recently, haven't we, in some of the
*06:54.560- 07:01.380* :  primary election votes, 100,000 over 100,000 voters in Michigan, for example, registered protest
*07:01.380- 07:07.700* :  votes against Mr. Biden. Many of those, because they are unhappy about his stance on Israel and they
*07:07.700- 07:13.140* :  want Mr. Biden to put more pressure on the Israelis. We'll learn in Washington, now back to
*07:13.140- 07:15.580* :  right, with more of the global news podcast.
*07:43.600- 07:44.800* :  James Menendez.
*08:28.520- 08:32.480* :  And who was responsible, and is there a link between what happened today in
*08:32.480- 08:36.300* :  Kaduna State to what happened last week, where you are in Borno State?
*08:37.760- 08:44.160* :  So the area where the kidnapping took place, Kureka, is really close to an area that's
*08:44.160- 08:49.600* :  dominated by an affiliator, Boko Haram. It's called Ansaru, Boko Haram. And they're responsible for
*08:49.600- 08:54.700* :  a lot of the mass abductions that happen in the northwest of Nigeria, so in the state of San
*08:54.700- 09:00.060* :  Farah, Kaduna, Katzina. So it's believed that those gunmen were from that faction. So there is a
*09:00.060- 09:04.880* :  link with what happened earlier this week with the internally displaced people in the northeast,
*09:04.880- 09:10.260* :  in Borno State, in that they are also believed to have been abducted by Boko Haram fighters.
*09:11.320- 09:17.380* :  Is Boko Haram then resurgent? I mean, has there been a significant uptick in activity,
*09:17.460- 09:19.220* :  and what might be behind that?
*09:20.200- 09:25.220* :  Well, the authorities here have been keen to say over the past couple of years that Boko Haram
*09:25.220- 09:32.100* :  is all but different, so they say that they've either arrested or converted any remaining fighters.
*09:32.640- 09:38.940* :  But I think what these last two incidents reveal is that the group still very much has a presence
*09:38.940- 09:43.860* :  in northern Nigeria, and it's still capable of carrying the kind of attacks that will remind
*09:43.860- 09:52.020* :  listeners of the abduction of the Chippell girls 10 years ago in Borno, and the anniversary of that
*09:52.020- 09:56.660* :  abduction is coming up next month. So I think it's particularly poignant that after a law
*09:56.660- 10:02.500* :  we've had a year, almost two years of not having these numbers, you know, over a hundred students
*10:02.500- 10:09.220* :  being taken. And why do they happen? I mean, is it about money for the kidnapping or is their
*10:09.220- 10:10.640* :  ideology behind it as well?
*10:12.040- 10:17.540* :  By all accounts, the Chippell girls was kind of an accident. A Boko Haram were looking for,
*10:18.320- 10:21.240* :  you know, some goods that were at their school. They found the girls, they took them, and their
*10:21.240- 10:25.280* :  amount of attention that they got kind of spurred them to do more of those types of abduction.
*10:25.280- 10:32.280* :  I think it's evolved to becoming more of a way of making money. A lot of those armed gangs
*10:32.860- 10:38.060* :  in the Northwest live in a part of the country that is incredibly impoverished, where opportunities
*10:38.060- 10:44.840* :  for advancement, for young people, particularly young men, are very few. And therefore, this is an
*10:44.840- 10:51.000* :  easy way to make money desperate parents who often pay ransom, you know, regardless of how much
*10:51.000- 10:55.100* :  they ask. And it's also an opportunity for Boko Haram to elevate its profile nationally and
*10:55.100- 10:59.120* :  internationally to show the world that it's still a group to be contended with.
*10:59.760- 11:05.740* :  Mayany Jones, satellite images reveal that North Korea has built hundreds of kilometers of
*11:05.740- 11:11.120* :  security fencing along its border with China in the past four years. The images have been
*11:11.120- 11:16.960* :  analysed by the organisation Human Rights Watch, who say the increased security has had a devastating
*11:16.960- 11:23.200* :  effect on North Koreans who rely on cross-border trade to make a living. Jean McKenzie reports from
*11:23.200- 11:28.540* :  Seoul. When North Korea sealed its borders at the start of the pandemic, it set to work fortifying
*11:28.540- 11:34.580* :  them, building fences and increasing surveillance, both to stop people escaping and to clamp down on
*11:34.580- 11:39.840* :  those secretly bringing in food and other goods from China. Human Rights Watch has analysed a quarter
*11:39.840- 11:45.040* :  of North Korea's border with China. Along this stretch alone, the number of garposts has jumped from
*11:45.040- 11:51.280* :  just 38 to more than six and a half thousand. One escapee who spoke to her relative back home said
*11:51.280- 11:57.060* :  rice could no longer be smuggled into the country. Jean McKenzie, it's thought that the world's
*11:57.060- 12:04.480* :  global shipping fleet consists of around 50 to 60,000 cargo vessels. That's a lot of traffic with
*12:04.480- 12:10.720* :  crews often spending weeks or even months at sea, but trials are underway for remotely operated ships,
*12:10.720- 12:15.980* :  which allow some of the crew to work on land and be with their families at the end of their shift.
*12:15.980- 12:21.540* :  The boats can be navigated from hundreds of kilometres away. Our science editor Rebecca
*12:21.540- 12:26.040* :  Morelle has been to a few order Norway to see one of these robot ships.
*12:27.540- 12:33.780* :  The vessel freshly painted in vivid lime green is 78 metres long and it's just come off the production
*12:33.840- 12:39.080* :  line. Here in the backpack of the ship you can see the real house of the ship and above that you
*12:39.080- 12:44.180* :  can see some of our satellite domes and some more cameras and some microphones which represent the
*12:44.180- 12:49.760* :  eyes and the ears of the ship. Colin Films works for ocean infinity. The company is building a fleet
*12:49.760- 12:54.820* :  of 23 of these vessels. They're designed to carry out jobs like surveys for the offshore
*12:54.820- 12:59.840* :  renewable sector and oil and gas industries. We've added a lot of additional equipment and
*12:59.840- 13:05.240* :  designed her especially to be what we call robotic. Our ultimate vision is for these vessels to have
*13:05.240- 13:14.560* :  a crew as small crew as possible. The work is shifting from the ship to the land to a remote
*13:14.560- 13:21.760* :  control centre hundreds of miles away in the UK in Southampton. In a vast dimly lit room,
*13:21.760- 13:26.880* :  live images and data stream in from the ship in Norway, the land-based crew members sit in
*13:26.880- 13:33.060* :  large-comp features equipped with gaming like controllers. You have these joysticks and you also
*13:33.060- 13:39.140* :  have touch screens. Marianne Metsa Charida is learning to remotely operate parts of the ship.
*13:39.380- 13:45.860* :  You can do almost everything that you do on the vessel. You can move around, you can see it,
*13:45.860- 13:51.820* :  you can have cameras, you can see the cameras here. It's exciting to know that there's an
*13:51.820- 13:57.840* :  opportunity to me to work on shore and still be involved in exciting projects.
*14:00.440- 14:05.800* :  Some vessels are setting sail with absolutely no one on board at all. In Plymouth Sound in the
*14:05.800- 14:10.980* :  southwest of England, a 12-meter-long boat is undergoing sea trials and it's being controlled
*14:11.120- 14:16.300* :  by a crew located at the other end of the country in an office in Aberdeen in Scotland.
*14:16.980- 14:20.540* :  Please control where they will be in control. Dimitri Dadeachin from the
*14:20.540- 14:26.820* :  shipping company Fugro is the boat's captain. Thank you and I will take control of Aberdeen.
*14:27.220- 14:32.680* :  I mean could you show us how you can control it from here? For example could you move it 90
*14:32.680- 14:40.320* :  degrees to the left which is port? Port side? Yeah we're using the thrusters and they're
*14:40.320- 14:44.620* :  selling command and you can see on the screen and the cameras will start talking to port.
*14:44.740- 14:50.400* :  This is all just by moving your mouse. Yes. Dimitri has spent years at sea working from an office
*14:50.400- 14:55.700* :  is a big change. When you on the vessel end of your shift you will still stay in
*14:55.700- 15:01.240* :  cons of vessel when you're working here so end of the day you just go home. Eventually the captain
*15:01.240- 15:06.800* :  or master could be in charge of multiple ships in oceans around the world. The regulations
*15:06.840- 15:12.080* :  won't allow this for larger ships yet but Hiker Degeem from the International Maritime
*15:12.080- 15:18.180* :  Organization who sets these rules says they're being reexamined. Would you now consider a remote
*15:18.260- 15:24.720* :  controlled centre operator being a master equivalent and how this will all be regulated?
*15:26.960- 15:32.360* :  Back on the dock side in Norway the next ship is being fitted out. It will be a long time before
*15:32.360- 15:37.460* :  every vessel is robotic but the next wave of shipping is already on the horizon.
*15:42.780- 15:48.040* :  Still to come, anticipation mounts ahead of a heavyweight boxing bout in Saudi Arabia
*15:48.520- 15:52.820* :  as an ex-martial art star faces a former world heavyweight champion.
*15:58.200- 16:02.840* :  What stories would you like to share with your daughter? What does she need to know to help her
*16:02.840- 16:08.760* :  navigate her life ahead? Deer daughter is the award-winning podcast from the BBC World Service
*16:09.180- 16:14.560* :  full of thoughtful letters of advice, personal stories and life lessons for daughters everywhere
*16:15.180- 16:20.220* :  and it's back for a new series with more of your letters and more fantastic guests.
*16:21.100- 16:24.560* :  Such for dear daughter wherever you get your BBC podcast.
*16:27.800- 16:33.160* :  Officials in Haiti say a state of emergency in the capital port of Prince has been extended
*16:33.160- 16:38.740* :  for another month as a security situation continues to deteriorate in the Caribbean nation.
*16:38.740- 16:44.820* :  Criminal gangs who control much of the capital attacked and burnt down a police station on Wednesday.
*16:44.820- 16:50.900* :  Haiti's Prime Minister Ariel Henri has not been able to return from Puerto Rico since Tuesday
*16:50.900- 16:56.480* :  after gang members attacked the country's main airport. A powerful gang leader has called
*16:56.480- 17:02.640* :  on Mr Henri to resign warning of civil war and further bloodshed. The Prime Minister had been in
*17:02.640- 17:08.340* :  Kenya appealing for help to send police officers to Haiti. The former US ambassador to Haiti,
*17:08.340- 17:15.940* :  Pamela White says Kenyan troops will not solve the problem. How a thousand Kenyans are going to
*17:15.940- 17:24.740* :  this chaotic situation and make any difference from we have 25,000 at least, maybe 30,000 gang members
*17:24.740- 17:30.880* :  in control of 80% of Puerto Pran said probably 60% of the country. I know that the United States has
*17:30.880- 17:34.840* :  said over and over we are not sending troops to Haiti and other UN has said we're not sending
*17:34.840- 17:41.580* :  troops to Haiti and even the Haitian police are running on pretty much zero and many, many have left
*17:41.580- 17:46.540* :  during the last year. At least a couple thousand have either been killed or gone to the United States.
*17:46.540- 17:53.640* :  I don't see any other solution except to have US and UN troops on the ground. I just don't.
*17:53.860- 17:59.880* :  Dave Fees, AMA is a resident of the capital port of Prince. He runs a charity which uses basketball
*17:59.880- 18:05.400* :  to keep young Haitians out of trouble. Rebecca Kesby asked him what his week had been like.
*18:05.940- 18:11.220* :  It's definitely been extremely challenging since last Thursday you've had or dated attacks by
*18:11.220- 18:16.700* :  fierce gangs throughout the Puerto Prince metropolitan area. We've had about a dozen or so
*18:17.060- 18:22.680* :  while for our beneficiaries and staff members and their family members staying at our office
*18:22.680- 18:28.460* :  because they've been forced to flee their homes. I mean we're hearing people can't even move around
*18:28.460- 18:35.660* :  normally, get to work, things like that. Exactly, especially since the prison break happened
*18:35.660- 18:42.100* :  over the weekend so there's been a curfew in place since this past weekend. Even though folks are
*18:42.100- 18:47.700* :  technically allowed to move around during daylight hours, I'm currently staring at the street right
*18:47.700- 18:52.580* :  now in front of my office and there are no vehicles in the street whatsoever. It's estimated that
*18:52.680- 18:59.780* :  there were about 3,696 prisoners in the main prison. Gang members, some folks who were arrested as
*18:59.780- 19:05.400* :  part of the assassination of the President of Nalmoese. So we have a wide variety of dangerous
*19:05.400- 19:10.980* :  criminals who were incarcerated in that prison who have now escaped. We've got the Prime Minister
*19:10.980- 19:17.220* :  currently pretty stranded actually in Puerto Rico. We can't fly home and there's been that attack
*19:17.700- 19:25.060* :  on the airport. We've got a barbecue now threatening civil war. I wonder what you made of the
*19:25.060- 19:32.180* :  comments there from the former US ambassador saying that UN troops need to go into Haiti and even
*19:32.180- 19:38.300* :  the prospect of Kenyan police turning up. Well from the very beginning of the UN mentioning
*19:38.300- 19:44.160* :  a multinational security mission coming to the country, I was a bit wary. I never believed
*19:44.160- 19:51.220* :  that having police officers from Kenya and other police officers from countries in the Caribbean
*19:51.220- 19:56.040* :  would be the right approach to dealing with a situation and that you need to highly specialise
*19:56.040- 20:03.780* :  train soldiers more experienced and real warfare who would be able to come in and do a more of a
*20:03.780- 20:10.480* :  shorter mission rather than the long-term mission that the UN is proposing. The gangs have a great
*20:10.480- 20:15.880* :  advantage in that they know of the territory much better than these Kenyan police officers
*20:15.880- 20:20.760* :  will be coming in. For ordinary people the people you work with the children I mean this all sounds
*20:20.760- 20:27.560* :  so terrifying and normal life has basically been suspended for what four years now. Exactly it's
*20:27.560- 20:33.280* :  been a very challenging situation for many years now in Haiti and it's just this heartening for me
*20:33.280- 20:39.360* :  for example to be in our office and seeing young people just laying carts on the floor to
*20:39.360- 20:44.340* :  sleep a staff member sleeping on the hallways with just a terrible situation to be living
*20:44.340- 20:50.460* :  through right now. Dave Fees AMA importer prints. Final preparations are underway in Riyadh in Saudi
*20:50.460- 20:56.900* :  Arabia for one of this year's most highly anticipated boxing matches. Britain's Anthony Joshua will
*20:56.900- 21:02.700* :  face Cameroon's former mixed martial arts champion Francis and Ganro in an intriguing heavyweight
*21:02.700- 21:08.940* :  contest later on Friday. In a moment we'll hear from BBC Sports Africa's Immanuel Akin-Dubuwa
*21:09.280- 21:16.340* :  in Anthony Joshua's hometown in Nigeria but first Paul G reports from Ganro's birthplace in Cameroon.
*21:24.780- 21:30.080* :  At Francis and Ganro's sports complex in his hometown of Bathe some of the boxing trainees he
*21:30.080- 21:36.680* :  is inspired are rooting for him in his upcoming fight against Anthony Joshua. Pure Kudum is one of them.
*21:38.140- 21:43.900* :  We know Anthony Joshua is strong and technical but our champion is also powerful. He will defeat
*21:43.900- 21:50.820* :  Anthony Joshua. Francis and Ganro's imposing physical strength is closely linked to his
*21:50.820- 21:57.900* :  former work as a minor. Raised by a single mother he began working in the sand quarry in Bathe
*21:57.900- 22:03.200* :  at just 10 years old. Chasing his dream to become a professional fighter,
*22:03.660- 22:09.060* :  Ganro left his hometown and spent 14 months traveling across Africa, Spain and France.
*22:09.840- 22:14.720* :  Homeless in Paris he eventually chanced upon an opportunity to train at a boxing gym.
*22:15.320- 22:19.160* :  Now he is seen as one of his country's finest fighting exports.
*22:20.300- 22:24.260* :  To the people of Bathe and Ganro is like a king.
*22:25.840- 22:29.560* :  Ganro's uncle, Die Donet Camero, is one of his biggest fans.
*22:29.560- 22:36.940* :  He is left in the image of not just the Bathe community but also Cameroon and Africa as a whole.
*22:37.460- 22:39.160* :  He is seeking us to the highest levels.
*22:41.660- 22:45.540* :  Back at the gym the trainees are confident in the astar.
*22:46.200- 22:49.860* :  The Bathe's man on the planet is Francis and Ganro.
*22:50.120- 22:53.100* :  He is the only one. He is the champion of champions.
*22:56.820- 23:02.320* :  I'm here in Chicago in southwestern Nigeria where there is a growing sense of anticipation
*23:02.840- 23:06.560* :  as the town gears up for another fight involving Anthony Joshua,
*23:07.160- 23:09.160* :  a man the region sees as one of its own.
*23:10.200- 23:13.100* :  The town even has a road named after him.
*23:13.420- 23:16.000* :  It's a burn which A.J. hoods closed to his heart.
*23:16.000- 23:21.520* :  Avan spent part of a school in here and as a map of Africa prominently tattooed on his shoulder.
*23:22.200- 23:26.300* :  Jagav's links to Joshua's family go back for more than a century.
*23:26.560- 23:29.820* :  First of all, you're welcome to the Joshua family house in Shandarmut.
*23:30.100- 23:35.160* :  Joshua's cousin Raymond Ajayri calls bin the fighter's sparring partner
*23:35.520- 23:37.720* :  when it visits and holidays as a teenager.
*23:38.200- 23:43.220* :  It runs in the family. We're all tough for my granddad, my uncles,
*23:44.180- 23:49.160* :  also Anthony Joshua's dad. We've grown up to know the tough side of life.
*23:49.200- 23:52.980* :  We've had to struggle. We've come through the hard time.
*23:52.980- 23:59.760* :  So we've all sort of had our own fair share of either street fights or professional fights
*24:00.540- 24:05.280* :  and we've never really come out bottom. So I can say he's got the bloodline in boxing.
*24:05.780- 24:10.420* :  Friday's contest between Joshua and Cameroon's friend Susa Garno.
*24:10.780- 24:14.640* :  It's seen by many as a showdown between two African brothers.
*24:15.480- 24:17.520* :  I'm so optimistic that he's going to win.
*24:17.820- 24:23.020* :  Coyote Shagun or Kewel is the president of the Anthony Joshua Boxing fans club in Shagamo.
*24:23.400- 24:28.260* :  My expectation for Anthony Joshua's next fight is positive.
*24:28.760- 24:34.520* :  The meeting between Joshua and Garno will ignite a long-standing sporting rivalry between Nigeria
*24:34.520- 24:40.840* :  and Cameroon, but for those people in Shagamo, the message is clear. It can only be one way now.
*24:41.080- 24:46.420* :  Emmanuel Akin-Dubuwa reporting. China says it will continue trying to make
*24:46.420- 24:52.000* :  Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang more Chinese. It has similar aims for other ethnic minorities
*24:52.000- 24:54.440* :  across the country as Mickey Bristol reports.
*24:55.120- 24:59.340* :  China has been accused of carrying out widespread human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
*24:59.340- 25:04.940* :  It denies the accusations and says it's simply introduced policies to fight extremism.
*25:05.400- 25:09.920* :  Speaking of China's annual parliamentary session, Xinjiang's Communist Party chief said
*25:09.920- 25:14.380* :  these policies would continue. An ethnic Uyghurs would be pushed to speak more
*25:14.380- 25:20.760* :  Mandarin Chinese. Beijing employs similar policies for Tibetans, Mongolians and other ethnic minorities.
*25:21.420- 25:25.320* :  China's aim is to create a single Chinese national identity.
*25:26.060- 25:31.000* :  The woman who accused the principal of the Red Bull Formula One racing team Christian
*25:31.000- 25:37.700* :  Horner of inappropriate and controlling behaviour has been suspended on full pay. Mr Horner,
*25:37.700- 25:42.600* :  who denied the allegations, was allowed to remain in his role after the claims were rejected.
*25:43.260- 25:48.760* :  Red Bull racing has declined to comment. Our sports news correspondent Laura Scott is following
*25:48.760- 25:54.800* :  developments. Well, it was a few weeks ago as the build up to the season was underway that we first
*25:54.800- 26:02.160* :  heard that Christian Horner was under investigation by Red Bull, the parent company of his team Red Bull
*26:02.160- 26:06.960* :  racing. Now, we knew at that time that these allegations were ones that Red Bull were taking
*26:06.960- 26:12.100* :  very seriously. We understood that it was inappropriate and controlling behaviour that was
*26:12.100- 26:19.140* :  being alleged. He denied the accusations every time we spoke to him. And then last week he was
*26:19.580- 26:24.700* :  of wrongdoing by Red Bull. They said that the complainant did have the right to appeal,
*26:24.700- 26:30.300* :  but that the investigation had been robust and thorough. The following day, just as everyone
*26:30.300- 26:36.720* :  was getting ready for the Bahrain Grand Prix, there was a leak of a raft of messages purporting
*26:37.000- 26:42.600* :  to involve Christian Horner. Now, he again denied the accusations, but it intensified the scrutiny
*26:43.840- 26:48.920* :  surrounding him. He is acting very much as business as usual. Red Bull racing went on to win
*26:48.920- 26:54.680* :  the Bahrain Grand Prix. And then today, as we prepare for the Saudi Arabia Grand Prix,
*26:54.680- 27:00.860* :  it emerged that the complainant had been suspended by Red Bull racing. Now, they haven't commented,
*27:00.860- 27:05.320* :  saying it's an internal matter, but of course, this means the story is far from going away.
*27:05.800- 27:10.980* :  And Christian Horner, he was asked about this, wasn't he? He was. There was a media conference
*27:10.980- 27:16.760* :  involving a number of team principals, and all of the questions from the media were to Christian Horner,
*27:16.760- 27:21.740* :  and all of them were around this issue, not for me to one itself, which clearly frustrates him.
*27:22.320- 27:27.580* :  Now, he was asked if he had regrets about potential reputational damage of the saga.
*27:28.180- 27:32.480* :  And he said, one has to go back to the basis of a grievance was raised, it was fully investigated,
*27:32.480- 27:37.320* :  and it was dismissed. From there, we move onwards. I think an awful lot has been made of this,
*27:37.640- 27:42.980* :  and I think the time now is to look forward and to draw a line under it. We are here to go racing.
*27:43.360- 27:48.640* :  So he's very clear that we should all just move on. But it must be a distraction.
*27:48.700- 27:53.080* :  I mean, but Red Bull are doing quite well. They are. I mean, if you look at the results
*27:53.080- 27:59.840* :  last weekend in Bahrain, they were one, two on the podium, which would suggest that they can,
*27:59.840- 28:05.440* :  as the drivers go, they can block this out. But Christian Horner did acknowledge in the build-up
*28:05.440- 28:09.800* :  to the season that this has been a distraction, and we will see how this plays out. We know that there
*28:09.800- 28:15.680* :  is a bit of division within the team with Max Verstappen's father Yoss saying that this whole
*28:15.680- 28:21.420* :  issue off the track is driving people apart. And we had Max Verstappen asked about this. He said,
*28:21.420- 28:26.220* :  my father is not a liar. So Christian Horner wants everyone to focus on the racing. He says the team
*28:26.220- 28:33.700* :  is unified. But this controversy very much continues. Laura Scott, the film Oppenheimer about the
*28:33.700- 28:40.100* :  creator of the atomic bomb is up for 13 awards at this weekend's Oscars. Directed by Christopher
*28:40.100- 28:45.340* :  Nolan, it tells the story of the Manhattan project during the Second World War, when scientists
*28:45.340- 28:51.260* :  built the bombs that were used on Japan. Los Alamos, the town in New Mexico where Oppenheimer carried
*28:51.260- 28:57.260* :  out his work, continues to play a key role in American nuclear weapons production. But as
*28:57.260- 29:01.340* :  Emma Vardy reports from the town, it's dealing with a conflicted history.
*29:01.980- 29:06.340* :  It's Saturday morning and I've come to the parking town where everyone walks their dogs.
*29:08.440- 29:12.760* :  A handful of scientists gathered for their Saturday ritual. Give the dogs a run about,
*29:12.760- 29:16.800* :  then it's over to the local brewery. It is 12-1, let's have a beer.
*29:18.460- 29:23.500* :  Many are drinking the local brew, known naturally as Oppenheimer. Gerald,
*29:23.500- 29:26.860* :  but local bartender says the film was brought plenty of new business.
*29:27.120- 29:30.660* :  We've been seeing a lot of tourism increase, a lot of extra attention.
*29:30.660- 29:35.620* :  We're setting a lot more merchandise. What about the moral aspect of what this symbolizes?
*29:36.320- 29:40.820* :  Well, we definitely have a very sort of nuanced and balanced view of that. There are a lot of
*29:40.820- 29:46.000* :  people who are only here because of the nuclear sighted things. They're completely dependent on that.
*29:46.000- 29:51.300* :  That's why they're here. But we do have to have that recognition of when things go wrong or even
*29:51.300- 29:54.780* :  when things are used as a weapon, like how horrific things can be.
*29:55.060- 29:57.940* :  A happenheimer, and there you go. Cheers to that.
*29:57.940- 30:02.220* :  Who people who live here are cutely aware of the ethical dilemmas that come with the science.
*30:02.960- 30:08.180* :  His soviet. Being a resident here and, you know, seeing what the science does,
*30:08.640- 30:12.800* :  for the community and what it does for the country. That's pretty amazing and I
*30:12.800- 30:17.200* :  thought that it was a chance for all of us to tell that story from that angle.
*30:17.280- 30:19.300* :  There was loss of life and that's tragic.
*30:19.300- 30:24.720* :  Kristen Hollis from the Historical Society shows visitors around, but there's a delicate balance
*30:24.720- 30:30.180* :  to strike. Los Alamos attracts both interested tourists and anti-war protesters.
*30:30.240- 30:37.660* :  It's really easy for us, 75 years later, to sit in self-righteous judgment of decisions that
*30:37.660- 30:42.060* :  were made in very different circumstances in the world than we are living today.
*30:43.080- 30:48.060* :  Are we saying there's a chance that when we push that button, we destroy the world.
*30:48.680- 30:52.280* :  The atomic bomb killed more than 200,000 people in Japan.
*30:53.140- 30:57.880* :  But according to some communities in New Mexico, there were also victims closer to home.
*30:58.140- 31:01.960* :  Both my great-grandfathers had cancer, my two grandmothers had cancer,
*31:02.320- 31:05.700* :  my father had three different cancers he didn't have risk factors for.
*31:05.960- 31:10.320* :  Tina campaigns for government compensation for families known as the downwinders,
*31:10.660- 31:14.860* :  who claimed they were affected by the detonation carried out in 1945.
*31:14.940- 31:18.820* :  The world's first nuclear explosion known as the Trinity test.
*31:19.220- 31:24.900* :  So the people of New Mexico ever since the time of the test have been suffering a variety
*31:24.900- 31:31.420* :  of different cancers. We firmly believe that we have been overexposed to radiation during the
*31:31.520- 31:32.140* :  Trinity bomb.
*31:37.900- 31:43.040* :  Anti-war campaigners want to see an end to nuclear production at Los Alamos, as the Oscars
*31:43.040- 31:46.920* :  approach, many see Oppenheimer not only as a historical tale,
*31:46.920- 31:50.120* :  but as a warning that remains just as relevant today.
*31:52.780- 31:55.920* :  Emma Vardy reporting from Los Alamos in New Mexico.
*31:58.660- 32:03.120* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*33:43.740- 33:46.620* :  Well, I know. It's all of those subscriptions.
*33:46.620- 33:51.300* :  I used rocket money to help me find out what subscriptions I'm actually spending money on,
