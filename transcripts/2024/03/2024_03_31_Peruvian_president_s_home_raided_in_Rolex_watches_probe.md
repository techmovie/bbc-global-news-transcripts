*01:43.600- 01:47.220* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:49.560- 01:55.420* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Sunday 31st of March, these are our main stories.
*01:56.000- 02:00.420* :  In a televised address, Peru's president has described an overnight raid on her home by
*02:00.420- 02:03.280* :  police investigating corruption as abusive.
*02:03.940- 02:09.080* :  A second shipment of food has set sale from Cyprus to Gaza amid warnings of an imminent
*02:09.080- 02:11.080* :  famine in the Palestinian territory.
*02:11.100- 02:16.200* :  Iran has denied any involvement in the stabbing of a dissident journalist in London.
*02:18.880- 02:24.840* :  Also in this podcast, a source has told the BBC that last month, the president of the
*02:24.840- 02:30.040* :  White House Correspondence Association, wrote an email to its members, warning that removing
*02:30.040- 02:33.060* :  items from the presidential plane is forbidden.
*02:33.400- 02:36.220* :  Who's been stealing from on-board Air Force One?
*02:36.220- 02:37.260* :  Find out later.
*02:41.880- 02:46.920* :  The Peruvian president, Dina Boloarte, has said she won't resign after police raided
*02:46.920- 02:51.400* :  her home and the presidential palace as part of an investigation into corruption.
*02:51.560- 02:56.440* :  The police were looking for more than a dozen luxury watches which the president had allegedly
*02:56.520- 02:57.360* :  not declared.
*02:57.880- 03:02.540* :  Speaking in a televised address, Miss Boloarte said she hadn't done anything wrong.
*03:03.480- 03:09.880* :  I've attended the prosecutor's office by appointing my lawyers and making myself available
*03:09.880- 03:13.860* :  so the dawn measures are arbitrary, disproportionate and abusive.
*03:14.660- 03:19.620* :  The situation is serious and affects my family's rights, but above all the country's governance.
*03:20.120- 03:23.900* :  Brothers and sisters, the president has been systematically attacked.
*03:25.000- 03:29.380* :  Our America's regional editor, Leonardo Rosha, who's following the story, told us more
*03:29.380- 03:31.580* :  about what Miss Boloarte had to say.
*03:32.160- 03:38.160* :  She went on national television with the whole cabinet behind her to explain what's been
*03:38.160- 03:38.600* :  going on.
*03:38.700- 03:43.100* :  First of all, she said that the raid on her home and the presidential palace where she
*03:43.100- 03:45.780* :  was abusive, unjustified.
*03:46.260- 03:51.680* :  She also said she might be the victim of sexism or prejudice because she's the first female
*03:51.680- 03:58.100* :  president of Peru and she says that she's been the victim of systematic harassment by
*03:58.100- 03:58.700* :  the system.
*03:59.160- 04:06.020* :  The whole allegation is that she has appeared wearing different Rolex watches, luxury Rolex
*04:06.020- 04:10.880* :  watches, they're worth more than $10,000 each in different occasions.
*04:10.980- 04:16.420* :  The media have picked up on that and now she's been asked to explain where it comes from.
*04:16.420- 04:21.580* :  There's an anti-corruption unit that's investigating that and that's what they went to her
*04:21.580- 04:26.700* :  house in the early hours of Saturday to investigate, to try to find those watches apparently.
*04:26.700- 04:31.760* :  They also went to her son's house, but they haven't apparently located any of the watches.
*04:32.500- 04:37.960* :  Miss Boloarte also spoke about the case causing what she called instability in the country.
*04:37.960- 04:39.140* :  What does she mean by that?
*04:39.460- 04:45.300* :  Well, she has a point there because Peru has had, if you counter the people who were replacing
*04:45.300- 04:50.280* :  presidents or entering presidents, they had seven presidents in the last eight years.
*04:50.780- 04:53.320* :  There was a point where they had six presidents in six years.
*04:53.780- 04:58.660* :  She herself was a vice president, President Pedro Castillo, who was a left-wing president,
*04:59.140- 05:03.940* :  was basically impeached after four months in power and she was a vice president.
*05:04.480- 05:10.060* :  She was a former lawyer with a different political orientation, more center right.
*05:10.500- 05:15.760* :  She took office, many people wanted her to resign and for new elections to be held and
*05:15.760- 05:17.440* :  she said no, I'll stay to the end.
*05:17.900- 05:23.860* :  What she's saying is that Peru has every politician there is a suspect of corruption.
*05:24.020- 05:29.400* :  She blamed the media, said the media is being fed by people with inside information and
*05:29.920- 05:35.960* :  she said what you have is political instability and also an impact on the economy.
*05:35.960- 05:42.180* :  And the poorest in Peru are being most affected by all that because it affects mainly long-term
*05:42.180- 05:42.780* :  investment.
*05:42.780- 05:47.380* :  And you have to remember that Peru was one of the worst affected countries in the world
*05:48.120- 05:48.800* :  by COVID.
*05:48.800- 05:53.740* :  They had one of the, if not the highest, one of the highest death rates in the world.
*05:54.320- 05:55.540* :  And that's what she's saying.
*05:55.540- 06:00.540* :  We need now to not to fall into these traps fed by the media.
*06:00.540- 06:01.420* :  That's what she's saying.
*06:01.660- 06:07.620* :  The opposition says she has to explain where those watchers came from and she hasn't on
*06:07.620- 06:09.180* :  this televised appearance.
*06:09.840- 06:10.800* :  Leonardo Russia.
*06:12.000- 06:16.840* :  Getting enough aid into the Gaza Strip is difficult, especially with ground operations
*06:16.840- 06:18.000* :  still going on there.
*06:18.120- 06:22.540* :  But for the second time this month, the ship carrying food aid to the territory has sailed
*06:22.540- 06:24.360* :  from the separate port of La Nica.
*06:24.660- 06:30.000* :  It's been chartered by the US-based World Central Kitchen and the Spanish charity Open
*06:30.000- 06:32.980* :  Arms and should bring around 400 tons of aid.
*06:33.500- 06:37.800* :  The distribution of aid that does get in remains a problem as fighting continues to rage
*06:37.800- 06:40.500* :  between the Israeli military and Hamas.
*06:40.860- 06:44.760* :  Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen is following developments from Jerusalem.
*06:45.660- 06:51.280* :  Last Monday's UN Security Council cease fire resolution is being ignored by all sides
*06:51.280- 06:51.880* :  in Gaza.
*06:52.560- 06:58.140* :  Initially, Hamas welcomed it, but Israel has continued with air strikes and its assault
*06:58.140- 07:01.000* :  in and around Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
*07:01.720- 07:04.700* :  Israel says it's killed senior Hamas commanders.
*07:05.080- 07:09.260* :  Palestinians say large numbers of civilians are being killed.
*07:09.680- 07:10.680* :  Hamas is still fighting.
*07:11.100- 07:15.460* :  Israel has announced the death of another soldier and serious wounds to others.
*07:16.120- 07:22.600* :  Israel continues to deny that it bears any responsibility for imminent famine in Gaza.
*07:22.960- 07:27.100* :  The war between Israel and his brother, the Lebanese militia and political movement
*07:27.100- 07:30.800* :  that is backed by Iran is escalating steadily.
*07:31.480- 07:34.920* :  All out war remains a highly dangerous possibility.
*07:36.060- 07:40.360* :  Reports say the United States is sending more weapons to Israel.
*07:40.380- 07:45.980* :  The President and his top officials have said repeatedly that Israel has killed far too
*07:45.980- 07:52.460* :  many innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza, often with American supplied one and two
*07:52.460- 07:55.540* :  thousand pound bombs used in built-up areas.
*07:56.140- 08:03.360* :  Now the U.S. despite its public misgivings about Israel's conduct appears to be refilling
*08:03.360- 08:04.720* :  its arsenals again.
*08:05.580- 08:11.260* :  Attaching conditions to the use of U.S. made weapons, as America does with Ukraine, is
*08:11.260- 08:17.760* :  one potentially powerful way of influencing Israeli behavior, but President Biden has chosen
*08:18.220- 08:19.120* :  not to use it.
*08:19.880- 08:25.840* :  Jeremy Bowen, the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Lebanon Unifil has expressed concern about
*08:25.840- 08:28.180* :  extended Israeli shelling into the territory.
*08:28.700- 08:33.500* :  It's still investigating an incident on Saturday in which three unifil observers and their
*08:33.500- 08:36.060* :  translators were injured by a shell explosion.
*08:36.540- 08:41.000* :  Israeli military has denied firing at them, saying they were targeting Hezbollah militant
*08:41.000- 08:41.480* :  positions.
*08:41.940- 08:47.860* :  Celia Hatton spoke to Andrea Tenenti, a unifilx spokesperson, and asked him for more on
*08:47.860- 08:48.800* :  Saturday's incident.
*08:49.480- 08:54.500* :  This morning three military observers are armed, and while 11 is the language assistant,
*08:54.500- 08:58.580* :  they were in the area close to the blue line in the village called Ramesha.
*08:58.720- 09:02.400* :  They were injured because of an explosion occurred in the area.
*09:02.400- 09:09.200* :  We are investigating the origin of this explosion, so we are still waiting for the outcome of
*09:09.200- 09:09.980* :  the investigation.
*09:10.240- 09:15.080* :  You mentioned the blue line, now your mission is stationed in southern Lebanon to monitor
*09:15.080- 09:21.400* :  hostilities along the demarcation line between Lebanon and Israel known as the blue line.
*09:21.400- 09:24.600* :  I wonder if you can give us some context over the past six months.
*09:25.180- 09:26.960* :  Have hostilities been increasing?
*09:27.440- 09:31.140* :  We have been concerning about the last six months from the very beginning.
*09:31.140- 09:36.820* :  I would say from the very beginning 80% of the exchanges of fire has been happening across
*09:36.820- 09:37.620* :  the blue lines.
*09:37.800- 09:45.540* :  But now we have seen a number of more targeted and little shelling even outside the air of
*09:46.140- 09:46.160* :  operations.
*09:46.160- 09:48.980* :  Some areas also pretty far away from the blue line.
*09:49.040- 09:53.500* :  This escalation could potentially trigger a much wider conflict.
*09:53.760- 09:58.420* :  I mean, indeed, on Friday the Israeli defense minister said Israel will now move from a
*09:58.420- 10:04.760* :  state of repelling Hezbollah to a state of actively pursuing the group, which has led
*10:04.760- 10:07.660* :  to concerns of widening confrontation.
*10:08.220- 10:10.100* :  How would you think about this statement?
*10:10.620- 10:15.920* :  Of course, we have been seeing a lot of statements from different ministers and parties.
*10:16.320- 10:18.460* :  We usually do not comment on this kind of statements.
*10:18.460- 10:25.500* :  There is always a difference between rhetoric and reality on the ground, although these escalations
*10:25.500- 10:30.780* :  and these exchanges of fire, which is pretty heavy, has been very concerning.
*10:30.780- 10:35.620* :  The mission has been doing is out most of the moment to monitor the area to try to
*10:35.620- 10:36.940* :  get escalate situations.
*10:37.740- 10:40.200* :  Andrea Tenente, a universal spokesperson.
*10:41.500- 10:45.780* :  The US and the UK flew over Gaza to air drop supplies of food.
*10:46.220- 10:50.760* :  I'm at least correspondent Lucy Williamson was on board one of the American planes involved
*10:50.760- 10:51.660* :  in the operation.
*10:54.560- 10:59.240* :  Air drops into Gaza are expensive, inefficient, and increasingly controversial.
*11:00.340- 11:06.120* :  At Aloudid Air Base in Qatar, US troops load crates of food aid into a military transport
*11:06.120- 11:10.120* :  plane to be flown almost 2,000 kilometers to Gaza.
*11:10.860- 11:12.260* :  We strap in with the crew.
*11:12.820- 11:16.200* :  Between us, dozens of crates packed with ready-prepared meals.
*11:16.820- 11:21.500* :  Each crate wrapped in dark green canvas, a parachute strapped to the top.
*11:22.240- 11:28.720* :  46,000 meals in all, for delivery to a population the UN says is on the brink of famine.
*11:29.620- 11:35.020* :  On board, I asked spokesman Major Ryan to camp if this was the right method of getting
*11:35.020- 11:35.640* :  aid in.
*11:35.940- 11:39.480* :  It's not perfect, we know that there's upwards of 2 million people who need food on the
*11:39.480- 11:40.200* :  ground who are hungry.
*11:40.200- 11:44.960* :  In the sense of billions, who didn't ask for this conflict and we're dropping meals
*11:44.960- 11:47.640* :  in the tens of thousands, but at least it's something.
*11:47.680- 11:51.820* :  So does it feel like a drop in the bucket maybe a little bit, but if you're a family
*11:51.820- 11:54.760* :  on the ground who got some of this aid, it can be a life saver.
*11:58.240- 12:00.480* :  In Gaza, the desperation continues.
*12:01.400- 12:06.720* :  12 people were reported to have drowned this week trying to retrieve aid packages from
*12:06.720- 12:07.220* :  the sea.
*12:07.740- 12:10.300* :  Six others crushed in a stampede.
*12:11.160- 12:16.200* :  On board the flight, Mission Commander Major Spencer Boon said he followed the news reports
*12:16.220- 12:17.240* :  from Gaza closely.
*12:17.800- 12:20.340* :  What are you doing to try and mitigate risk?
*12:20.740- 12:21.880* :  Literally everything we can.
*12:22.360- 12:27.020* :  We use a shoot that falls at a slower rate to give the Gaza and Port Times to see the
*12:27.020- 12:29.340* :  parachutes and make sure that they're out of the way.
*12:29.940- 12:34.520* :  We also have assets overhead that clear the drop zone so we will not drop if there's
*12:34.520- 12:36.060* :  any sort of groupings of people there.
*12:39.540- 12:44.240* :  After three hours in the air, the ramp opens on Gaza's devastated coastline.
*12:44.980- 12:49.220* :  On the roads below, people can be seen apparently chasing the plane.
*12:49.800- 12:53.140* :  The parachutes quickly shrinking to specks above the water.
*12:53.940- 12:55.100* :  Two, don't open.
*12:55.760- 12:58.280* :  We watch as the parcels crash into the sea.
*13:01.420- 13:06.840* :  On the ground, people rushing between the increasing number of aid drops here say many miss
*13:06.840- 13:07.160* :  out.
*13:07.680- 13:09.260* :  There just isn't enough to go around.
*13:11.660- 13:14.980* :  For most people, hunger has consumed them.
*13:15.660- 13:17.560* :  They have no energy anywhere.
*13:18.440- 13:22.900* :  Ahmed Tafesh from Gaza City was one of the crowd chasing the aid drop from foreign
*13:22.900- 13:23.300* :  planes.
*13:25.860- 13:29.160* :  We have tried without luck to find the aid twice this morning.
*13:30.240- 13:31.040* :  We will try again.
*13:32.020- 13:38.060* :  We hope no one will stop us and that we will be able to get the food easily without having
*13:38.060- 13:38.640* :  to crowd.
*13:39.600- 13:44.080* :  If we can at least get a can of beans or hummus, that will help.
*13:49.220- 13:53.780* :  Getting aid in this way is a last resort, but a growing number of countries are doing
*13:53.780- 13:54.000* :  it.
*13:54.540- 13:57.260* :  The RAF flew two flights to Gaza this week.
*13:58.080- 14:03.580* :  Meanwhile, the U.S. has reportedly confirmed fresh arms supplies to Israel as President
*14:03.580- 14:06.920* :  Biden insists that Israel do more to get aid in.
*14:07.620- 14:13.680* :  The U.S. flight banks sharply and turns back towards Qatar, leaving two key questions
*14:13.680- 14:14.380* :  in its wake.
*14:15.220- 14:19.620* :  How much do these eye-catching deliveries relieve pressure on Gaza's civilians?
*14:20.480- 14:23.160* :  And how much the pressure on governments elsewhere?
*14:24.900- 14:26.780* :  That report by Lucy Williamson.
*14:27.700- 14:32.300* :  To London next, where an Iranian journalist is recovering in hospital after he was stabbed
*14:32.300- 14:38.040* :  in the streets while on his way to work, Pouliya Zarati is a presenter for Iran International
*14:38.100- 14:43.140* :  and independent broadcaster based in London and critical of the Iranian regime.
*14:43.520- 14:45.960* :  Iran has denied any involvement in the attack.
*14:46.280- 14:51.380* :  Justice Zarati is now recovering in hospital and his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.
*14:51.380- 14:54.640* :  British counterterrorism police have launched an investigation.
*14:54.960- 14:58.200* :  Our world affairs correspondent Paul Adams has more.
*14:58.960- 15:03.700* :  In a social media post this afternoon, Pouliya Zarati is seen smiling from his hospital
*15:03.700- 15:06.860* :  bed, defiantly flashing a V for victory sign.
*15:06.860- 15:11.460* :  But this was a serious attack on a prominent Iranian journalist on the streets of London.
*15:11.820- 15:17.120* :  A spokesman for Iran International Adam Bailey told the BBC he had no doubt who was behind
*15:17.120- 15:23.020* :  it, citing a pattern of intimidation by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, the IRGC.
*15:23.220- 15:27.860* :  The fact that counterterrorism is leading the investigation probably speaks for itself.
*15:28.120- 15:32.820* :  The channel, along with our colleagues at BBC Persia, Iran International has been under
*15:33.000- 15:33.240* :  threat.
*15:33.340- 15:38.980* :  They heavy threat for the last 18 months since the IRGC said we're coming for you.
*15:39.100- 15:43.700* :  Iranian journalists in London, including some who work for the BBC, have been living
*15:43.700- 15:45.660* :  with the threat of violence for some time.
*15:45.660- 15:50.900* :  Two years ago, a plot to kill two members of Iran International staff was foiled.
*15:51.240- 15:56.080* :  In January, Britain and America announced sanctions against Iranian officials allegedly
*15:56.080- 16:02.000* :  involved in threats of violence on UK soil, and criminal gangs recruited to do Iran's bidding.
*16:02.360- 16:06.600* :  The Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said at the time the message was clear such threats
*16:06.600- 16:07.920* :  would not be tolerated.
*16:07.920- 16:13.800* :  But one of the two journalists targeted in 2022, Seema Sabed, says the police advised
*16:13.800- 16:17.940* :  her last night to leave home and stay elsewhere until further notice.
*16:18.460- 16:22.920* :  She says Western governments are simply not doing enough to address the dangers faced
*16:22.920- 16:27.020* :  by Iranian journalists who voice criticism of the regime in Tehran.
*16:27.260- 16:28.020* :  Paul Adams.
*16:28.660- 16:33.300* :  Lauren Taylor spoke to Seema Summit, the former Iran International presenter.
*16:33.900- 16:38.040* :  What is her reaction to the recent attack in London on Pouliya Zarity?
*16:38.740- 16:43.340* :  Well, I was shocked and I was angry and I was outraged, of course, I mean, I had news
*16:43.860- 16:50.560* :  that the IRGC was planning an assassination against my life and my colleague, which we were
*16:50.820- 16:58.300* :  informed of the whole plot in December, and this came just few months after, and I know
*16:58.300- 17:04.100* :  that if there was a serious action taken, after that bit of news came out, we were
*17:04.100- 17:10.300* :  then have observed another attempt on the life of another journalist in London, at the
*17:10.300- 17:11.820* :  heart of London, at our home.
*17:12.200- 17:17.520* :  So of course, I was very angry and then a few hours after the attack happened on Pouliya,
*17:17.960- 17:24.600* :  I got a call from counter-terrorism police asking me that I should leave my residents and
*17:24.600- 17:28.840* :  stay somewhere until they let me know that it's safe for me to come back.
*17:29.000- 17:33.480* :  Are you worrying for you and for all your former colleagues as well?
*17:33.940- 17:38.860* :  Yes, it's very sad and it's very worrying at the same time, this is not fair and this
*17:38.860- 17:44.840* :  is not right for us as a journalist, because we should be safe in what we do, we should
*17:44.840- 17:50.160* :  feel safe in our country, this is our country, this is our home, and we are UK nationals
*17:50.160- 17:53.140* :  being threatened at our home at the doorstep.
*17:53.520- 17:58.860* :  So what I was thinking that if the UK government had taken it seriously, if the UK government
*17:58.860- 18:04.420* :  had met with me, if the UK government was willing to listen to us, that we are victim,
*18:04.880- 18:09.400* :  well, we are victim and we are not victim, I don't like to declare myself as a victim,
*18:09.400- 18:14.780* :  but at the same time the Islamic Republic is just taking a step to attack us and never
*18:14.780- 18:16.140* :  has the test to take our life.
*18:16.640- 18:24.720* :  So we have to have a channel of being communicated to the government, being heard at the government
*18:25.300- 18:26.380* :  and announcing yes.
*18:26.740- 18:31.140* :  What's the impact being on, for international viewers who maybe people who don't watch Iran
*18:31.140- 18:36.400* :  international, what kind of a channel is it, and why is the Iranian regime so unhappy about
*18:36.400- 18:37.160* :  what it's doing?
*18:37.500- 18:42.400* :  Iran International is a news channel, 24 hours news channel, and they're only 24 hours
*18:42.400- 18:49.360* :  news channel, and of course I mean anything that brings further information, the dissemination
*18:49.360- 18:54.400* :  of the news to the public in Iran, of course it's the Islamic Republic and the government
*18:54.400- 18:56.140* :  doesn't feel comfortable with.
*18:56.720- 19:01.560* :  So it's not only about Iran international, BBC's board service also has the same problem
*19:01.560- 19:02.280* :  of BBC version.
*19:02.880- 19:03.700* :  Seema Sabat
*19:06.460- 19:07.260* :  Still to come
*19:07.880- 19:11.800* :  The leaked information is thought to include social security numbers and appears to be from
*19:11.800- 19:13.220* :  2019 or earlier.
*19:13.980- 19:20.260* :  The US telecoms company AT&T says the data of millions of customers has been leaked onto
*19:20.300- 19:20.980* :  the dark web.
*19:27.600- 19:29.460* :  What are used as a weapon of war?
*19:29.660- 19:34.200* :  In none of these villages there was any piped clean water for people.
*19:34.400- 19:36.480* :  A nation in the grip of criminal gangs.
*19:36.860- 19:40.800* :  How bad does it have to get before the international community reacts?
*19:41.220- 19:43.220* :  A country showing signs of fracture.
*19:43.420- 19:46.300* :  Right now it's done, things are really quite dark.
*19:46.300- 19:49.680* :  The nation is divided, the mistrusts are so deep.
*19:50.000- 19:53.980* :  The global jigsaw from the BBC World Service is back for a new series.
*19:54.600- 19:59.100* :  Listen now by searching for the explanation, whatever you get your BBC podcasts.
*20:03.780- 20:07.780* :  And last time then it takes to unsubscribe from all those cringing marketing newsletters

*20:29.560- 20:30.280* :  Hey I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*20:30.280- 20:36.280* :  Recently I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation.
*20:36.780- 20:37.340* :  They said yes.
*20:37.340- 20:42.300* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said,
*20:42.360- 20:44.160* :  what the f**k are you talking about?
*20:44.180- 20:45.680* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*20:46.020- 20:51.380* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*20:51.400- 20:53.940* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.
*21:04.720- 21:06.940* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*21:08.040- 21:12.980* :  The war in Sudan has left tens of millions of people in need of aid according to the UN.
*21:13.040- 21:17.680* :  Of them, about 5 million people are facing catastrophic levels of hunger.
*21:17.700- 21:23.060* :  It's almost a year since war broke out between the Sudanese Army and the rapid support forces.
*21:23.060- 21:29.540* :  Since then, the capital city Khartoum has collapsed and ethnic cleansing has resumed in the Darfur region.
*21:30.000- 21:34.140* :  Muhammad Gamal is a spokesperson for the World Food Programme in Sudan.
*21:34.740- 21:36.800* :  He explained the scale of the emergency.
*21:37.420- 21:44.060* :  It's an imaginable, we have nearly 18 million people who are severely fooled and insecure.
*21:44.920- 21:49.700* :  And 5 million of these are at an emergency situation.
*21:50.340- 21:58.380* :  And sadly, around 90% of those are in areas that are inaccessible to humanitarian actors.
*21:59.200- 22:01.480* :  And that's the major problem that we are facing.
*22:01.760- 22:08.960* :  Not only that, but Sudan is currently witnessing the largest displacement crisis in the world.
*22:09.700- 22:18.180* :  The problem is that most of the people who flee the conflict areas are going to countries that are already suffering.
*22:18.560- 22:22.060* :  And these are South Sudan, Chad, for example.
*22:22.900- 22:27.840* :  With no end in sight, what can be done to help the millions of people who are forced to flee their homes?
*22:27.840- 22:32.160* :  I spoke to the BBC's Africa Security Correspondent Ian Mafula.
*22:33.260- 22:37.380* :  The UN says that whatever is happening in Sudan is like nothing we've ever seen before.
*22:38.060- 22:41.580* :  They actually describe it as the last humanitarian crisis in recent history.
*22:41.680- 22:46.540* :  And there are actually unfortunate reports coming from Sudan that children are dying of hunger.
*22:46.540- 22:54.640* :  Old people or those who are sick cannot access the medication just because the conflict has widely affected the entire country.
*22:54.640- 23:00.680* :  Because it has been low agricultural production, because the conflict has interfered normal day to day life.
*23:00.680- 23:04.600* :  And there hasn't been any agricultural production since the war began.
*23:04.600- 23:11.700* :  On top of that, we have the twerring sides actually blocking aid from going into areas that are controlled by the arrivals.
*23:12.780- 23:20.680* :  And this they say is out of suspicion that the arrivals are using these routes or convoys to transport away from them.
*23:20.680- 23:26.520* :  So ideally humanitarian organizations are saying that our food is now being used as a weapon of war.
*23:26.820- 23:33.460* :  For the people who've been affected, we're looking at at least 1,000 people who have died since they were begun last April.
*23:33.960- 23:37.580* :  And nearly 8 million people who've been displaced from their homes.
*23:37.580- 23:44.500* :  And these numbers could go up as far as the war is concerned if it does not stop any time soon.
*23:44.800- 23:46.420* :  And there is no end in sight, is there?
*23:46.800- 23:55.080* :  Unfortunately not at the moment because all efforts to bring the two warring sides to kind of talk through their issues have not been resolved.
*23:55.860- 24:05.540* :  That's recently we had the US special envoy to Sudan, Tom Perrioli thing that in fact they hope that talks will resume in Saudi Arabia on the 18th of April.
*24:05.540- 24:08.840* :  This is just three days after the war shall have turned one year.
*24:09.300- 24:18.980* :  But since the war began, the two sides have barely even sat in face each other eye to eye, just because they cannot agree on the direction in which the country should take.
*24:19.440- 24:26.700* :  Is it possible that either side, both sides would be prepared to work with the humanitarian agencies just to get the aid in?
*24:27.000- 24:32.920* :  The humanitarian agencies have cleared with them over time. Over the last three months, this has been the scenario.
*24:32.920- 24:37.180* :  But then it appears that they're not feeding to these pleas.
*24:37.180- 24:49.380* :  In fact, a couple of months ago back in November, the UN Secretary General Anthony Gutierrez said that these boys are as a result of two generals who have decided to put their interests fast and the people aside.
*24:49.780- 24:51.080* :  It's the people who are suffering.
*24:51.980- 24:55.400* :  The BBC's Africa Security Correspondent Ian Wafula.
*24:56.520- 25:04.600* :  The Indian Navy says it is free to hijacked Iranian fishing vessel and rescued its crew from nine armed pirates in the Arabian Sea.
*25:04.600- 25:09.760* :  The statement added that the Pakistani crew was safe, and Barassan at a Russian reports.
*25:10.680- 25:21.760* :  The Indian Navy said the Iranian ship was intercepted by two of its naval vessels and that the pirates surrendered after 12 hours of what it described as cohesive tactical measures.
*25:22.360- 25:30.020* :  The fishing vessel Al-Khambar 786 was reported to have been boarded by pirates on Thursday off the coast of Yemen.
*25:30.540- 25:38.100* :  Specialist teams have boarded the ship for further checks and to escort her to a safer area to resume normal fishing activities.
*25:38.740- 25:48.360* :  There has been an increase in piracy since Yemen's Houthi rebels started attacking merchant ships in the nearby Red Sea after the outbreak of war in Gaza.
*25:49.100- 25:50.440* :  And Barassan at a Russian.
*25:51.680- 26:04.860* :  One of the largest telecoms companies in the US AT&T says personal data from more than seven and a half million current customers was leaked onto the dark web two weeks ago, more from Andrew Ochiang.
*26:05.380- 26:10.020* :  US media reported that more than 65 million former customers had also been affected.
*26:10.020- 26:15.800* :  The leaked information is thought to include social security numbers and appears to be from 2019 or earlier.
*26:16.320- 26:21.420* :  In a statement, AT&T said personal financial information or call histories had not been leaked.
*26:21.960- 26:24.900* :  The company says it is still investigating the source of the data.
*26:25.400- 26:29.020* :  It is not known whether it came directly from AT&T or a third party.
*26:29.460- 26:33.880* :  The telecoms Dan said it does not have evidence of unauthorized access to its systems.
*26:33.880- 26:36.820* :  It has contacted customers affected by the breach.
*26:37.580- 26:38.480* :  Andrew Ochiang.
*26:39.400- 26:48.380* :  The art of drag has become more mainstream in recent years with people donning makeup and extravagant clothes to take part in shows like RuPaul's Drag Race.
*26:48.900- 26:56.360* :  Marina Summers didn't win the finale but says she already felt like a winner having represented the Philippines on a global stage.
*26:56.360- 27:05.060* :  The country has one of the largest Catholic populations in the world, same-sex marriages band and LGBT people often face discrimination.
*27:05.120- 27:09.680* :  But there are some in Manila who believe drag culture is important.
*27:10.320- 27:19.580* :  Here in the Philippines, we don't have yet a law or institute where LGBT members can support or be respected.
*27:19.580- 27:24.920* :  But Filipinos are so generous and we Filipinos love to perform.
*27:25.860- 27:31.960* :  I think one of the most pressing issues that the queer community is facing right now in the Philippines is the lack of representation.
*27:31.960- 27:38.940* :  I think we should promote the drag culture in the Philippines because drag is a protest. It's not a crime.
*27:39.440- 27:45.380* :  Marina Summers told the BBC her drag persona goes hand in hand with her Filipino identity.
*27:46.040- 27:49.480* :  My Filipino name speaks for itself when I'm in drag because of my height.
*27:49.700- 27:56.620* :  I mean, compared to all of my fellow castmates in the cast, you can really see that, oh, that's the Filipino one, the short one.
*27:56.960- 28:09.800* :  I'm very proud of it. But apart from that, I really like to showcase my heritage and my culture through drag because here in the Philippines, we value that so much.
*28:09.800- 28:14.840* :  I came from a very, very small province up north.
*28:14.840- 28:21.740* :  I mean, my upbringing was really centered with culture, arts and heritage for drag queens.
*28:21.740- 28:30.100* :  I think the larger majority of the Philippines is still in the process of being educated on what drag is really.
*28:30.880- 28:35.400* :  My audience, personally, my audience is very celebratory when it comes to drag.
*28:35.800- 28:48.180* :  But when you go outside of that audience, for example, when news publications post about Marina or drag queens, a lot of, I would say still narrow-minded people
*28:48.700- 28:52.680* :  aren't educated about drag, still post discriminatory remarks.
*28:52.700- 28:56.020* :  And we still have a long way to go in that topic.
*28:56.020- 29:01.960* :  There's still a lot of setbacks. There are still a lot of violence towards the queer community.
*29:01.960- 29:13.580* :  And as of the moment, we don't have anything specifically made for the LGBT QIA plus community in terms of rights and laws that could protect us.
*29:14.040- 29:18.060* :  The religion has a lot to do in this matter.
*29:18.980- 29:19.820* :  Marina Summers.
*29:20.940- 29:24.320* :  Details have emerged of a crime wave of sorts.
*29:24.320- 29:38.860* :  On the world's most famous plane, branded items such as glassware and pillowcases have been vanishing from the official aircraft of the President of the United States, Air Force One, the likely calprits, journalists.
*29:39.600- 29:41.740* :  From Washington, the BBC's Will Vernon reports.
*29:41.740- 29:54.720* :  A source has told the BBC that last month, the President of the White House Correspondence Association, wrote an email to its members, warning that removing items from the presidential plane is forbidden.
*29:55.580- 30:00.920* :  Kelly O'Donnell said such behavior didn't cast the journalists in a very good light and must stop.
*30:00.920- 30:10.600* :  Reports suggest the press cause pilfering was identified after an inventory was taken aboard Air Force One following a visit by Mr. Biden to the West Coast.
*30:11.320- 30:17.440* :  Several items were found to be missing from the rear cabin of the aircraft, the section reserved for reporters.
*30:18.120- 30:27.960* :  On the next trip, officials will likely be keeping a closer eye on the presidential wine glasses and hoping the journalists don't go home with anything other than a good story.
*30:28.400- 30:29.060* :  Will Vernon.
*30:32.140- 30:34.260* :  And that's all from us for now.
*30:34.260- 30:38.020* :  But there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*30:38.020- 30:43.860* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.

*30:57.560- 30:59.640* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*31:00.020- 31:02.500* :  I'm Alex Ritson and until next time, goodbye.
*31:03.700- 31:05.860* :  .
