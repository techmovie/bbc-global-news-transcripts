*00:16.960- 00:20.920* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*00:21.120- 00:23.580* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*00:23.900- 00:28.040* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*00:28.040- 00:31.300* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

*00:49.420- 00:53.960* :  I'm Katya Adler from the Global Story Podcast, where we're looking at the tiny country of

*00:58.580- 01:02.920* :  But will newfound oil reserves be a windfall or their downfall?

*01:49.000- 01:50.200* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:50.200- 01:56.060* :  We're recording this at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday, the 26th of March, a bridge in the US
*01:56.060- 02:01.060* :  port of Baltimore collapses after being hit by a cargo ship, at least four vehicles plunge
*02:01.060- 02:02.860* :  into the water and seven people are missing.
*02:03.620- 02:09.040* :  Turkey arrests nearly 150 Islamist suspects following the deadly attack on a concert hall in
*02:09.040- 02:13.980* :  Russia, and white adults rather than babies are becoming the main market for nappies or
*02:13.980- 02:15.180* :  diapers in Japan.
*02:17.900- 02:22.920* :  Also in the podcast, Venezuela's opposition suffers another setback in efforts to challenge
*02:22.920- 02:25.380* :  the autocratic president in this year's election.
*02:26.000- 02:31.240* :  Dramatic footage emerges at a raid at the home of US rapper Sean Diddy Combs.
*02:31.700- 02:33.340* :  And...
*02:33.340- 02:35.340* :  It did give the right instructions about how to make it.
*02:35.560- 02:39.900* :  What it didn't tell me was all of the kind of tips that I would add in.
*02:40.480- 02:43.280* :  Would you trust artificial intelligence in the kitchen?
*02:47.860- 02:52.260* :  It is one of America's busiest ports handling cargo from around the world.
*02:52.760- 02:57.980* :  But today, Baltimore is closed to shipping after a major bridge collapsed into the water.
*02:58.620- 03:03.200* :  Webcam footage from the port of Baltimore overnight showed a container ship hitting one of the
*03:03.200- 03:10.660* :  bridge supports just before 1.30 a.m., a 300-metre section of road then collapses into the Patapsco
*03:10.660- 03:15.860* :  River, along with at least four vehicles, and nearby residents heard the vessel collide
*03:15.860- 03:16.660* :  with the bridge.
*03:16.840- 03:23.040* :  We wanted to know what the bang was, ship hit the key bridge, sinking, the bridge is gone.
*03:27.120- 03:27.840* :  Holy hell.
*03:29.460- 03:33.440* :  The Baltimore Fire Chief James Wallace says they're still searching for people in the
*03:33.440- 03:33.780* :  water.
*03:34.180- 03:40.300* :  At about 0150 hours, our first unit arrived on scene and reported a complete collapse
*03:41.180- 03:42.060* :  of the key bridge.
*03:42.740- 03:47.780* :  We were also given information that there were likely multiple people on the bridge at
*03:47.780- 03:52.600* :  the time of the collapse, and that as a result, multiple people were in the water.
*03:53.480- 03:58.260* :  Well the city's mayor, Brandon Scott, spoke of his shock at seeing the bridge come down.
*03:58.600- 04:00.780* :  This is a tragedy as you can never imagine.
*04:00.780- 04:05.680* :  I was awake when Chief Wallace called me, but never would you think that you would see,
*04:05.680- 04:09.020* :  physically see, the key bridge tumbled down like that.
*04:09.020- 04:13.780* :  It looked like something out of action moving, and you just think about most importantly,
*04:13.780- 04:16.120* :  which is where we all should be thinking about right now.
*04:16.680- 04:21.260* :  Nothing but those families and people that are impacted and those people who are risking
*04:21.260- 04:26.620* :  their lives right now, from not just Baltimore City and Baltimore County, but all over this
*04:26.620- 04:28.620* :  state to try to save lives.
*04:29.020- 04:33.120* :  Well the governor of the state of Maryland has declared a state of emergency.
*04:33.920- 04:38.180* :  Not long after dawn broke in Baltimore, I got the latest from our correspondent there,
*04:38.180- 04:38.980* :  Tom Bateman.
*04:39.380- 04:43.760* :  I'm standing at the moment on the east side of the harbor, and we're looking across to
*04:44.280- 04:45.640* :  this scene of destruction.
*04:45.840- 04:53.780* :  I can see the Singapore flag to contain a vessel, and it is a really unbelievable image
*04:53.920- 05:02.240* :  of destruction, this cantilever bridge that is just twisted and wrecked, and two huge
*05:02.240- 05:09.680* :  or triangular shapes of the wreckage now pointing out from the water away from the center
*05:09.680- 05:15.400* :  point of the bridge completely collapsed, and the ship itself just stuck there, a bit
*05:15.400- 05:19.360* :  of smoke pissed me rising either from it close to it or behind it.
*05:20.000- 05:25.660* :  And in the water now there are divers searching for what the fire authorities have described
*05:25.660- 05:31.640* :  as potentially around seven people they fear are missing, and now this urgent recovery
*05:31.640- 05:33.700* :  and rescue work goes on.
*05:34.440- 05:40.580* :  I'm looking at footage shot from the air, you can see the nose of that vessel in the
*05:40.900- 05:41.960* :  wreckage of the bridge.
*05:41.960- 05:47.320* :  It is a big ship, and inevitably if it had hit any part of the bridge it would have come
*05:48.620- 05:48.640* :  down.
*05:49.820- 05:50.480* :  Do we know what went wrong?
*05:50.480- 05:56.620* :  What's available from both the marine tracking websites, and also that live stream video
*05:57.160- 06:00.820* :  of the moments where the ship hit the bridge itself.
*06:00.880- 06:06.000* :  So on the first point it appeared that the ship was docked, it then turned in the water,
*06:06.640- 06:11.120* :  and made a very short journey, in the minutes before it struck the bridge.
*06:11.120- 06:15.820* :  Now you can see this from the live stream video, all of the lights and the power appear to
*06:15.820- 06:16.500* :  be on on the ship.
*06:16.500- 06:22.300* :  About three minutes before it hits that support pillar, the ship goes completely dark.
*06:22.900- 06:27.520* :  Now some of them appear to come back on about a couple of minutes before it makes impact,
*06:28.180- 06:33.740* :  and then what appears to be drifting, it turns slightly in the water, takes about two
*06:33.740- 06:39.440* :  minutes before it makes impact, and there's a cloud of what I imagine is dust and masonry
*06:40.220- 06:43.740* :  that emanates from the support pillar as it strikes the bridge.
*06:44.080- 06:48.580* :  The other thing to say about that moment is you can see in the minutes before it hits
*06:48.580- 06:53.220* :  the bridge, there is traffic on the bridge, the trucks, and you can see the headlights
*06:53.220- 06:56.080* :  of larger vehicles anyway, a few minutes beforehand.
*06:57.100- 07:03.720* :  But the moment it makes impact, you can't see visibly any traffic apparent on the bridge.
*07:04.180- 07:09.600* :  Now the fire service have said that they believe there's a tractor trailer or a truck,
*07:09.620- 07:11.280* :  they say, in the water.
*07:11.720- 07:14.560* :  We don't know if there's more than that, there were certainly reports that there could
*07:14.560- 07:15.940* :  be more vehicles in the water.
*07:16.620- 07:21.920* :  Tom Bateman in Baltimore, after I spoke to him, US officials confirmed that the Singapore
*07:21.920- 07:26.640* :  flag vessel Dali had lost propulsion as it was leaving Baltimore Harbor.
*07:27.160- 07:31.500* :  The crew notified the State Department of Transportation that they'd lost control
*07:31.500- 07:33.700* :  of the vessel before the collision.
*07:34.420- 07:38.180* :  Construction crews were working on the bridge at the time, and we'll return to this
*07:38.180- 07:39.940* :  story before the end of the podcast.
*07:40.940- 07:46.380* :  Turkey says nearly 150 people linked to so-called Islamic State have been detained in a series
*07:46.380- 07:47.760* :  of raids across the country.
*07:48.140- 07:53.000* :  The Turkish President, Richard Tyver, had a one promised to work with Russia, following
*07:53.000- 07:56.000* :  Friday's attack in Moscow, which has been claimed by IS.
*07:56.540- 08:00.340* :  Our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Eberhard, told us more about the security operation
*08:00.340- 08:00.920* :  in Turkey.
*08:01.620- 08:08.680* :  147 suspects have been detained, and the Interior Minister Ali Ali Kaya has put this
*08:08.680- 08:11.420* :  in context of wider raids against Islamic State.
*08:11.420- 08:15.580* :  Now obviously Turkey has its long-standing problems with the Islamic State militant group,
*08:15.960- 08:20.440* :  having suffered numerous attacks, including recently in January, an attack on a church
*08:20.460- 08:21.140* :  in Istanbul.
*08:21.800- 08:28.520* :  The Interior Minister says that 2,900 people have been detained since June of last year,
*08:29.020- 08:32.860* :  with a number of things seized for, and currently documents and digital materials.
*08:33.380- 08:39.440* :  And he says that Turkey is engaged in fighting terrorism 365 days of the year.
*08:39.660- 08:45.040* :  On the specifics of the four suspected perpetrators of the Moscow attack, all of them are
*08:45.180- 08:45.580* :  not tragic.
*08:46.060- 08:53.280* :  Turkey's State Broadcaster reported on Monday that 2 of the four had been recently in Turkey.
*08:53.600- 08:59.900* :  One of them, Faridun Shamsiddin, who suspected to be the ringleader, was in a hotel in Istanbul
*08:59.900- 09:02.700* :  between the end of February and the beginning of March.
*09:03.140- 09:09.120* :  Another Saeed Akram Rajab Ali Zodar arrived in Istanbul in January and returned on the
*09:09.160- 09:11.300* :  same flight as Faridun Shamsiddin.
*09:11.700- 09:16.980* :  So Turkey's security sources have told the paper that it was too short a time for them
*09:16.980- 09:18.660* :  to have been radicalized in Turkey.
*09:18.660- 09:24.060* :  They contend that they were radicalized in Russia, but there are long-standing links in Turkey
*09:24.060- 09:27.860* :  with Islamic State groups, including the Khorosan group linked to the Moscow attacks.
*09:28.180- 09:29.820* :  And I'll talk to you, Danny Eberhard there.
*09:30.320- 09:35.420* :  The rights of Venezuelans are being denied, the words of the woman hoping to challenge
*09:35.420- 09:38.180* :  the country's long-term president, Nicholas Maduro.
*09:38.820- 09:43.820* :  Karina Yoris, the opposition's latest figurehead, says she's been blocked from standing in
*09:43.820- 09:44.620* :  the upcoming election.
*09:44.620- 09:50.020* :  The 80-year-old said she'd exhausted all possibilities to file her application, but
*09:50.020- 09:52.360* :  insisted the constitution had to be respected.
*09:55.020- 09:56.540* :  I'm not anyone's substitute.
*09:56.660- 10:01.800* :  We're in a transitional period and the deadline for registering candidates must be respected.
*10:02.320- 10:07.640* :  You know that we will not deviate from the electoral route, nor will we bypass the constitution.
*10:08.240- 10:11.140* :  So what does this all mean for politics in Venezuela?
*10:11.140- 10:14.580* :  I heard from Latin America editor Vanessa Bushlutter.
*10:15.140- 10:21.480* :  This means that the woman who had a chance of beating President Maduro if, and this is
*10:21.480- 10:27.020* :  a big if, the elections were free and fair, has now been eliminated.
*10:27.520- 10:30.200* :  She is not able to stand at this moment.
*10:30.760- 10:36.860* :  Of course her coalition of opposition parties will try and circumvent this and still get
*10:36.860- 10:42.000* :  her on the ticket, but as it stands now, she will not be standing for election.
*10:42.200- 10:45.880* :  Karina Yoris is an unknown even in opposition circles.
*10:45.940- 10:52.780* :  She was only nominated by her party on Friday because the real candidate, Maria Karina Machado,
*10:52.780- 10:59.040* :  who had gotten more than 90% in opposition primary, was barred by the Supreme Court from
*10:59.040- 11:02.000* :  standing for 15 years for office.
*11:02.440- 11:07.800* :  So Maria Karina Machado tried everything to stand herself and when that wasn't possible,
*11:07.940- 11:14.360* :  she chose this 80-year-old academic because she is somebody that the government couldn't
*11:14.360- 11:15.880* :  find any fault with.
*11:16.260- 11:20.680* :  There's no corruption scandals that have tainted her because she's such an unknown.
*11:20.700- 11:25.120* :  There's nothing that they could pin on her and that was why she was chosen.
*11:25.460- 11:27.300* :  And yet they still managed to stop her.
*11:27.840- 11:32.340* :  As it stands, does it look like Nicholas Maduro will get another term in office?
*11:32.800- 11:33.480* :  Very much so.
*11:33.700- 11:39.080* :  Unless, like I said, there's free and fair elections and I don't think that Maduro and
*11:39.080- 11:44.960* :  his administration will allow that, there seems to be every chance that Nicolas Maduro
*11:44.960- 11:48.540* :  will serve a third term until 2031.
*11:49.020- 11:52.120* :  Vanessa Bushlutter are Latin America's editor.
*11:53.160- 11:58.140* :  Napis or diapers are an essential piece of kit for new parents, but the low birth rate
*11:58.140- 12:03.640* :  in Japan has prompted one manufacturer to move away from making them for babies and instead
*12:03.640- 12:08.780* :  is turning to the adult market as I heard from our Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Hatton.
*12:09.240- 12:14.480* :  This really is symbolic of how things are changing rapidly in Japan, Oliver.
*12:14.480- 12:20.560* :  You know, back in 2016, that's really the first time that we learned that more adult
*12:20.560- 12:26.240* :  diapers or nappies were being sold in Japan than diapers or nappies that were made for babies.
*12:26.240- 12:29.280* :  That was one indication of how the birth rate was falling.
*12:29.640- 12:35.740* :  Now that's changed so much that whole trend has continued to such a degree that one of
*12:35.740- 12:41.600* :  the biggest makers of those products, OG Holdings, has decided it's just not worth making
*12:41.600- 12:46.880* :  infant diapers or nappies anymore that they should just stop doing it and instead they're
*12:46.880- 12:51.220* :  going to be making them for other markets around the world where populations are growing,
*12:51.220- 12:56.360* :  where lots of babies are being born, but they're not going to bother to make any more for babies
*12:56.360- 13:01.020* :  being born inside Japan because the birth rate has fallen so much.
*13:01.280- 13:03.900* :  Yeah, just one example of the impact.
*13:03.900- 13:06.160* :  What else is it affecting this low birth rate?
*13:06.660- 13:07.440* :  Lots of things.
*13:07.440- 13:12.240* :  I mean, Japan life has changed so much just in the past 20 years, really.
*13:12.820- 13:16.560* :  One third of the population is over the age of 65.
*13:16.560- 13:21.760* :  That's why so many things in Japan are talking about pensions, talking about nursing homes,
*13:22.260- 13:25.800* :  less than 12% of the population is under the age of 15.
*13:25.800- 13:30.560* :  So we regularly hear about schools closing down because they simply don't have enough students.
*13:31.040- 13:36.360* :  You know, the birth rate is just so low that it really has shifted daily life in Japan.
*13:36.640- 13:41.460* :  Yeah, the government doesn't seem to have made any impacts on trying to change that.
*13:41.860- 13:42.940* :  Where is Japan going?
*13:43.380- 13:48.440* :  Well, it's so bad that the Prime Minister just a month ago said that the falling birth rate
*13:48.440- 13:54.340* :  is Japan's biggest crisis. One of the main people in his cabinet followed that up by saying
*13:54.340- 13:59.660* :  that they think the country really has just six years to try to reverse the trend.
*13:59.800- 14:05.240* :  And a lot of the focus has been to try to encourage married couples who already have children
*14:05.240- 14:11.160* :  to opt to have even more children. Most young people say that they simply don't feel that they
*14:11.160- 14:16.320* :  have the career prospects. They don't have the ability to move into a place that could allow
*14:16.320- 14:21.680* :  them to have a family. So it's a much bigger systemic problem than just a lack of
*14:21.880- 14:24.560* :  parents wanting to have two, three or four children.
*14:24.960- 14:28.080* :  Celia Hutton. Next, to one of hip-hop's biggest stars.
*14:28.400- 14:28.940* :  Let's rock.
*14:29.740- 14:32.020* :  You dig in my style, my swag, my sway, my swerve.
*14:32.120- 14:34.400* :  My way with words, the boys that serve for sure.
*14:34.520- 14:36.820* :  You can't fall to my aura, call them up.
*14:37.400- 14:41.520* :  Sean Diddy Combs. The singer has hit the headlines yet again.
*14:41.520- 14:46.360* :  After his homes in LA and Miami were raided by Homeland Security agents,
*14:46.360- 14:50.520* :  officials say it's part of a federal sex trafficking investigation.
*14:50.520- 14:54.080* :  Our North America correspondent David Willis spoke to Nick Gureshi.
*14:54.460- 14:58.960* :  The aerial footage shows dozens of federal agents, some of them armed,
*14:58.960- 15:05.680* :  dressed in tactical gear, swarming the Los Angeles Mansion home of Sean Combs.
*15:06.120- 15:12.760* :  It's a sprawling, massive property in the upmarket enclave of home-be-hills,
*15:12.760- 15:17.560* :  as it's known here. That's an area where several other leading celebrities have a home.
*15:17.560- 15:23.540* :  And the pictures also showed several people on a grass verge outside the property
*15:24.140- 15:27.800* :  in handcuffs whilst the agent searched the premises.
*15:28.380- 15:33.840* :  A simultaneous operation also involving dozens of agents was mounted at a home in Miami.
*15:33.840- 15:37.080* :  And it is also associated with Sean Combs.
*15:37.360- 15:41.340* :  Details of the search warrant, though, haven't been released.
*15:41.340- 15:45.600* :  But it is, as you mentioned there, being reported here that this was all part
*15:45.600- 15:48.780* :  of a federal sex trafficking investigation.
*15:49.400- 15:55.660* :  Although there's no word on whether Sean Combs himself is the target of that investigation.
*15:55.780- 16:00.920* :  He's aware about, apparently unknown, but there are unconfirmed reports
*16:01.120- 16:08.140* :  that federal agents in Florida seized his phones shortly before he was due to leave
*16:08.600- 16:09.960* :  for a trip to the Caribbean.
*16:10.160- 16:12.800* :  All right, well, we'll see what happens there, David.
*16:12.920- 16:17.560* :  A number of cases, though, aren't there pending against Sean Combs?
*16:17.960- 16:22.860* :  There are. And he is, of course, one of the biggest names in hip-hop music.
*16:22.860- 16:27.700* :  Three times a Grammy winner, also the founder of his own fashion company,
*16:27.700- 16:29.180* :  his own television network.
*16:29.800- 16:35.560* :  But last November, his former girlfriend, the R&B vocalist, Cassie Ventura,
*16:35.960- 16:39.580* :  filed a lawsuit against him amongst other things, accusing him
*16:39.940- 16:42.100* :  of domestic violence and sex trafficking.
*16:42.100- 16:47.680* :  And she also claimed in that lawsuit that he had applied her with drugs and alcohol
*16:47.680- 16:51.380* :  at various times. Now the case was settled out of court.
*16:51.380- 16:56.400* :  But it paved the way to civil lawsuits on the part of two other women who also accused
*16:56.400- 17:01.560* :  P. Diddy of grooming and sexually assaulting them back in the early 1990s.
*17:01.940- 17:05.300* :  And then in December, another woman came forward to accuse him
*17:05.620- 17:10.700* :  and two other men of raping her when she was just 17 years old.
*17:11.000- 17:14.620* :  And then last month, the male music producer filed a lawsuit in New York,
*17:14.620- 17:18.000* :  accusing Sean Combs of groping and sexually assaulting him.
*17:18.000- 17:22.900* :  Mr. Combs has denied all the allegations against him and one of his lawyers,
*17:23.460- 17:26.100* :  indeed referred to them as complete lies.
*17:26.780- 17:28.020* :  David Willis in California.
*17:30.320- 17:32.180* :  Still to come on the global news podcast.
*17:32.180- 17:35.060* :  Those hops are vital to the British pint.
*17:35.060- 17:38.240* :  But without that, we're just going to be importing beer.
*17:38.740- 17:42.260* :  Saving the great British pint from the threat of climate change.
*17:48.300- 17:50.120* :  What are used as a weapon of war?
*17:50.340- 17:54.920* :  In none of these villages, there was any piped, clean water for people.
*17:55.080- 17:57.160* :  A nation in the grip of criminal gangs.
*17:57.520- 18:01.480* :  How bad does it have to get before the international community reacts?
*18:01.900- 18:03.900* :  A country showing signs of fracture.
*18:04.080- 18:06.960* :  Right now it's done. Things are really quite dark.
*18:06.960- 18:10.360* :  The nation is divided. The mistrusts are so deep.
*18:10.660- 18:14.660* :  The global jigsaw from the BBC World Service is back for a new series.
*18:15.240- 18:17.700* :  Listen now by searching for the explanation,
*18:18.100- 18:19.780* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:27.580- 18:29.600* :  I'm Katya Adler from the Global Story Podcast,
*18:29.600- 18:32.800* :  where we're looking at the tiny country of Guyana,
*18:33.240- 18:36.040* :  which is the fastest growing economy in the world.
*18:36.860- 18:41.080* :  But will new found oil reserves be a windfall or their downfall?
*18:41.720- 18:42.160* :  Curious?
*18:42.160- 18:45.480* :  The Global Story brings you fresh takes and smart perspectives
*18:45.480- 18:47.420* :  from BBC journalists around the world.

*18:58.800- 19:02.120* :  Israel has a history of ignoring UN resolutions.
*19:02.120- 19:07.960* :  So it's little surprise that the Security Council's demand for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza on Monday
*19:08.320- 19:09.220* :  hasn't been met.
*19:09.920- 19:15.040* :  The UN resolution also called for the unconditional release of all the hostages held by Hamas
*19:15.040- 19:16.360* :  and other Palestinian groups.
*19:16.900- 19:18.160* :  That hasn't happened either.
*19:18.680- 19:23.280* :  Early on Tuesday, Israel carried out new air strikes and pursued operations in cities
*19:23.280- 19:25.420* :  in the north and south of the strip.
*19:25.900- 19:29.700* :  Leo Cairns is the head of mission for Medicines on Frontier in Gaza.
*19:30.180- 19:31.320* :  He's been talking to Rob Young.
*19:32.020- 19:34.280* :  Even today, after nearly six months of war,
*19:34.280- 19:37.340* :  the hospitals are under attack more than ever.
*19:37.920- 19:41.220* :  In Shifa Hospital, it's completely invited by the Israeli Army.
*19:41.620- 19:42.700* :  The hotel is not functional.
*19:43.000- 19:44.440* :  The patient have not access to healthcare.
*19:44.700- 19:46.780* :  We wanted to go three days ago to Nasir Hospital.
*19:46.780- 19:48.760* :  We were denied access by the Israeli Army
*19:49.060- 19:50.960* :  because of military operation in the area.
*19:51.320- 19:53.940* :  In Anaman Hospital, it's exactly the same what is going on.
*19:53.940- 19:56.900* :  Is that there is military operation nearby the hospital.
*19:56.900- 20:00.020* :  One people have been sniped inside Anaman Hospital
*20:00.680- 20:02.160* :  and the people couldn't evacuate today.
*20:02.160- 20:03.220* :  They go from the hospital.
*20:03.800- 20:07.600* :  So we see a pattern of systematic attack on the hospital.
*20:08.040- 20:12.160* :  Today, to be a healthcare worker in Gaza is the most dangerous job ever.
*20:12.480- 20:15.160* :  And I think it's sad and it should be revolting.
*20:15.320- 20:17.880* :  It's unacceptable that healthcare worker once more
*20:18.280- 20:19.380* :  are being the main victim.
*20:19.700- 20:23.860* :  Israeli defense forces say that Hamas gunmen are firing at troops
*20:23.860- 20:26.880* :  from Al Shifa Hospital, from the emergency room
*20:26.880- 20:29.920* :  and from the maternity ward, among others.
*20:30.260- 20:32.840* :  If they weren't there, the Israeli defense forces
*20:33.280- 20:35.720* :  might not be launching an operation around the hospital.
*20:36.200- 20:37.780* :  Yeah, you know, I think I actually is very clear.
*20:37.780- 20:40.400* :  Hospital should not be used as a military purpose.
*20:40.660- 20:42.160* :  Any side have to respect the hospital.
*20:42.160- 20:44.560* :  We have been seeing direct shooting at hospital,
*20:44.560- 20:47.380* :  including Shifa Hospital, including Naseh Hospital.
*20:47.980- 20:49.900* :  So yes, we are calling for all rubbing parties
*20:49.900- 20:50.760* :  to respect the hospital.
*20:50.760- 20:52.560* :  It is basic IHL.
*20:52.880- 20:54.520* :  But what we see in the beginning of the war
*20:54.520- 20:57.000* :  is that a systematic military operation
*20:57.920- 20:59.680* :  directed to all the major hospital.
*20:59.680- 21:02.400* :  And then on top of this, we are seeing a mass arrest
*21:02.400- 21:03.440* :  of medical people.
*21:03.780- 21:06.500* :  Many medical people, healthcare person, has been arrested.
*21:06.960- 21:08.260* :  Either we see in the hospital
*21:08.260- 21:10.600* :  or well-trained to leave the hospital.
*21:11.080- 21:12.600* :  And when there are arrests, some of them are
*21:12.600- 21:15.040* :  deported to Israel and we have no news about them.
*21:15.240- 21:16.340* :  It's a complete blackout.
*21:16.700- 21:18.360* :  We have no information whatsoever
*21:18.360- 21:19.700* :  but what's happening to them.
*21:19.900- 21:23.120* :  Leakans from the Medical Charity MSF in Gaza.
*21:23.660- 21:26.480* :  A former chairman of China's Football Association
*21:26.480- 21:29.760* :  has been sentenced to life in prison for taking bribes.
*21:30.140- 21:32.180* :  The charges against Chen Shuiwen
*21:32.420- 21:33.900* :  and a number of other officials
*21:34.320- 21:36.960* :  are part of a wider crackdown on corruption in the game.
*21:36.960- 21:40.120* :  Mark Dreyer is a journalist and expert in Chinese football.
*21:40.120- 21:42.540* :  He told James Menendez about the convictions.
*21:43.280- 21:47.800* :  Chen Shuiwen is one of about close to a dozen senior Chinese
*21:47.800- 21:49.880* :  sporting officials mostly involved with football
*21:49.880- 21:53.300* :  but also other sports that have been found guilty.
*21:53.300- 21:55.640* :  And a lot of the sentences were handed out today.
*21:55.640- 21:59.280* :  So this is the investigation that's been going on for about 18 months
*21:59.280- 22:00.440* :  or more at this point.
*22:00.440- 22:02.740* :  We knew that they were going to be found guilty.
*22:02.840- 22:04.940* :  That was revealed about a month or so ago
*22:04.940- 22:07.200* :  but the sentences have been made official today.
*22:07.200- 22:09.360* :  Chen has a 15 year sentence.
*22:09.360- 22:11.800* :  He has been accused of taking bribery
*22:11.800- 22:13.740* :  about $11 million worth in total.
*22:13.860- 22:16.220* :  Some of the other officials have similar offenses.
*22:16.220- 22:17.860* :  A lot of it is bribery in corruption.
*22:17.900- 22:20.260* :  That's the gist of this wider investigation.
*22:20.540- 22:22.040* :  And what does it tell us about the way
*22:22.040- 22:23.620* :  that football in China operates?
*22:23.960- 22:25.200* :  About a decade or so ago,
*22:25.240- 22:27.120* :  there was a big match fixing scandal
*22:27.140- 22:29.560* :  and that's been snared, you know, a whole bunch of players
*22:29.560- 22:32.420* :  and managers and referees and officials
*22:32.860- 22:35.160* :  and then things seemed to be better
*22:35.160- 22:37.220* :  than with the boom years where the Chinese super league
*22:37.220- 22:39.640* :  were attracting a lot of some of the top footballers
*22:39.760- 22:40.680* :  including from the Premier League
*22:40.720- 22:42.420* :  and some of the top talents around the world.
*22:42.720- 22:45.660* :  And then things started to take a bit of a turn for the worse.
*22:45.680- 22:48.140* :  And this is the right at the end of this chapter
*22:48.680- 22:50.480* :  of a dark period of Chinese football.
*22:50.680- 22:52.860* :  Is it necessarily going to change the fact
*22:52.860- 22:54.580* :  that people at the top have been removed?
*22:54.580- 22:56.260* :  Well, to be honest, I'm not so sure.
*22:56.500- 22:58.040* :  I think it's more of a systemic issue
*22:58.040- 23:00.460* :  than just a handful of ban apples that have been found.
*23:00.460- 23:03.360* :  I have to say this is not specific to football.
*23:03.580- 23:05.040* :  Things have definitely got better.
*23:05.040- 23:06.220* :  I think you have to say that.
*23:06.220- 23:08.440* :  But the fact that corruption is still
*23:08.900- 23:10.620* :  rife, perhaps, is too strong a word
*23:10.620- 23:13.260* :  but it's still very much present in certain sectors.
*23:13.560- 23:14.500* :  Football being one example,
*23:14.500- 23:16.820* :  clearly there's still lots more to be done
*23:16.820- 23:19.320* :  even if the situation is better than it was a decade ago.
*23:19.440- 23:21.880* :  Is there a feeling amongst the Chinese leadership
*23:21.920- 23:25.400* :  in the Communist Party that China in terms of football
*23:25.500- 23:28.120* :  isn't performing perhaps as well as it should
*23:28.120- 23:30.840* :  given the leadership's ambitions for the country
*23:30.840- 23:31.800* :  if I can put it like that?
*23:32.080- 23:32.860* :  Well, very much so.
*23:33.260- 23:34.360* :  I mean, there was a slightly
*23:34.360- 23:36.320* :  farcical situation in the last few days
*23:36.320- 23:38.480* :  where the captain of the Chinese national team,
*23:38.720- 23:40.460* :  Jean-Lin Peng, who was once rumored to be
*23:40.460- 23:42.880* :  sought after by Chelsea, he resigned
*23:42.880- 23:45.680* :  after a disgraceful performance as he called it.
*23:45.680- 23:47.380* :  The team was too null up against Singapore
*23:47.380- 23:49.200* :  and then they ended up drawing two, two.
*23:49.660- 23:52.080* :  And then a few days later, he said he changed his mind.
*23:52.080- 23:53.820* :  So clearly they didn't even let him resign.
*23:54.020- 23:56.720* :  The state of Chinese football has just been abysmal
*23:56.740- 23:58.720* :  and I think the fans know it, the officials know it,
*23:58.720- 23:59.960* :  the leadership know it, of course.
*24:00.360- 24:02.340* :  China is a top-down country
*24:02.720- 24:04.200* :  and everything comes from the top,
*24:04.200- 24:06.100* :  whereas football really to flourish
*24:06.480- 24:08.820* :  needs a bottoms-up or a grassroots approach.
*24:08.860- 24:10.620* :  And it's that contradiction that I think
*24:10.620- 24:12.220* :  is holding football back in China.
*24:12.760- 24:14.620* :  Chinese football expert Mark Dreyer.
*24:15.340- 24:17.200* :  Britain is famous for its pubs
*24:17.200- 24:19.600* :  and the beer served within with bitter,
*24:19.600- 24:21.060* :  perhaps the most famous example.
*24:21.640- 24:23.400* :  But our scientists fear climate change
*24:23.400- 24:26.140* :  could call time on the great British pint
*24:26.140- 24:29.080* :  as a result of its impact on the hops plant.
*24:29.980- 24:31.280* :  So they've sprung into action
*24:31.280- 24:32.780* :  to help the brewing industry,
*24:32.780- 24:35.680* :  as I heard from our science correspondent, Palab Goshe.
*24:36.120- 24:39.940* :  British bitter is very much part of the culture in the UK.
*24:40.260- 24:42.420* :  But the issue is actually a worldwide issue
*24:42.420- 24:45.000* :  because hops are used in all beers,
*24:45.000- 24:46.840* :  wherever it's brewed.
*24:47.320- 24:48.560* :  And across the world,
*24:48.960- 24:51.420* :  hop production has plummeted over the decades
*24:51.420- 24:53.840* :  because of the hotter Dreyer conditions
*24:54.620- 24:57.760* :  that have become increasingly more frequent over the years.
*24:57.940- 25:00.300* :  One study found in parts of Europe,
*25:00.300- 25:02.880* :  hop production had dropped by 20%.
*25:02.880- 25:06.080* :  And also it's having an effect on the taste,
*25:06.540- 25:09.480* :  the acids that give that bitter taste,
*25:09.480- 25:10.660* :  particularly to bitter,
*25:10.660- 25:13.480* :  which people in the UK love has actually gone down.
*25:13.940- 25:15.880* :  And it has to be specific to countries
*25:15.880- 25:18.460* :  because the genetics vary from variety
*25:18.460- 25:20.480* :  to variety that's grown in different parts of the world.
*25:20.940- 25:22.360* :  Science in the UK are looking
*25:22.720- 25:25.100* :  at the various varieties of hops that are used
*25:25.420- 25:27.080* :  in beer making in the country
*25:27.540- 25:29.460* :  and searching through all the genes
*25:29.960- 25:32.340* :  and looking for genes that will make varieties
*25:32.340- 25:34.540* :  drought resistant, disease resistant,
*25:34.940- 25:37.180* :  but also finding the genes for flavour
*25:37.680- 25:41.200* :  so that in five years' time when they've done their genetic searches,
*25:41.700- 25:44.860* :  hop breeders will be able to breed new varieties
*25:44.860- 25:46.600* :  that are both climate resistant
*25:47.060- 25:50.200* :  and also more flavoursome much more quickly.
*25:50.620- 25:52.280* :  So what it'll taste even better?
*25:52.660- 25:54.280* :  It's not so much even better.
*25:54.280- 25:56.840* :  Fashion's change these days,
*25:56.840- 25:59.120* :  certainly in the UK, possibly worldwide,
*25:59.120- 26:02.220* :  some consumers want punchier, stronger flavours
*26:02.520- 26:05.000* :  and that's been dealt with in the UK
*26:05.000- 26:08.960* :  by importing American hops to add to the mix.
*26:09.320- 26:10.700* :  But what they'd really like to do,
*26:10.780- 26:12.520* :  and which should be better for the environment,
*26:12.520- 26:16.540* :  is to grow those punchier flavoured hops in the UK.
*26:17.120- 26:18.600* :  There's also citrusy flavours
*26:18.600- 26:20.320* :  which younger people like,
*26:20.620- 26:22.660* :  and also what they hope to do
*26:22.780- 26:25.060* :  is to kind of have this library of flavours
*26:25.420- 26:28.420* :  to identify flavours that people don't like yet
*26:29.000- 26:30.120* :  but might like in the future.
*26:30.640- 26:30.920* :  Amazing.
*26:31.660- 26:33.500* :  Palab Gauche, our science correspondent.
*26:34.480- 26:37.000* :  Artificial intelligence is everywhere these days,
*26:37.000- 26:38.400* :  disrupting everything from work
*26:38.400- 26:40.460* :  and education to entertainment.
*26:40.540- 26:43.700* :  But can we trust it when it comes to something like food?
*26:44.380- 26:46.660* :  AI, cookbooks are now all over the internet
*26:46.660- 26:48.800* :  but do the recipes really stack up?
*26:48.800- 26:50.820* :  Alfie Habeson has been investigating.
*26:51.520- 26:53.960* :  It's probably time to admit that chat GPT
*26:53.960- 26:55.000* :  simply knows better,
*26:55.620- 26:56.840* :  summarising that long novel
*26:56.840- 26:58.480* :  that we never quite got around to reading
*26:58.660- 27:00.320* :  or writing that university essay
*27:00.320- 27:01.520* :  in a matter of seconds.
*27:02.300- 27:04.980* :  It's effortless, even if some find it a bit threatening.
*27:06.020- 27:07.520* :  But is there one part of life
*27:07.520- 27:09.980* :  where it just can't quite match us?
*27:10.580- 27:12.820* :  Because what does a chatbot really know
*27:13.060- 27:14.960* :  when it comes to the pleasures of eating?
*27:16.040- 27:18.580* :  Well, AI cookbooks are now flooding the internet
*27:18.580- 27:19.500* :  with new recipes
*27:20.180- 27:23.400* :  but understandably many of us are a bit wary to try them.
*27:24.100- 27:25.940* :  Professional chef Claude McKenna
*27:25.940- 27:28.200* :  has been experimenting with an AI recipe
*27:28.200- 27:30.420* :  for an American breakfast classic,
*27:30.940- 27:31.600* :  eggs Benedict.
*27:32.100- 27:36.540* :  I'm just taking the poached eggs out of my saucepan.
*27:36.700- 27:37.720* :  They're coming out perfectly.
*27:38.560- 27:41.900* :  The holiday sauce is lovely and fluffy
*27:41.900- 27:44.840* :  and just as I would like it.
*27:45.000- 27:48.200* :  It did give the right instructions of how to make it.
*27:48.500- 27:49.840* :  What it didn't tell me was
*27:50.480- 27:52.960* :  all of the kind of tips that I would add in
*27:52.960- 27:56.220* :  because making holiday sauce can so easily go wrong.
*27:56.220- 27:57.060* :  It can scramble.
*27:57.520- 27:58.880* :  So I would have added in
*27:59.300- 28:01.480* :  if you see your eggs beginning to scramble.
*28:01.660- 28:02.620* :  Take them off, eat,
*28:02.980- 28:05.200* :  and whisk in vigorously some hot water.
*28:05.480- 28:07.740* :  And the other thing was with the poached eggs
*28:08.480- 28:09.700* :  and it was very, very basic.
*28:09.700- 28:11.640* :  It's like pop them into a ram again
*28:11.640- 28:13.060* :  and then straight into the saucepan.
*28:13.060- 28:16.240* :  But it did not tell me to swirl the water,
*28:16.460- 28:17.440* :  which is key.
*28:17.820- 28:19.900* :  But it's not just the taste that's at stake here.
*28:20.480- 28:21.620* :  Like the best chef's,
*28:21.680- 28:24.700* :  AI has an experimental spirit when it comes to cooking.
*28:25.520- 28:27.040* :  But that's not always a good thing
*28:27.060- 28:28.680* :  when it comes to unintended results
*28:28.680- 28:31.620* :  like mosquito repellent roast potatoes
*28:32.280- 28:34.580* :  or bleach-infused rice surprise.
*28:35.720- 28:38.700* :  And it gets even weirder when it comes to the images.
*28:39.300- 28:41.840* :  Looking at two-tailed shrimps and hot dog stir fries
*28:41.840- 28:44.120* :  might not only threaten our skills in the kitchen
*28:44.120- 28:45.660* :  but also our appetites.
*28:46.260- 28:47.900* :  But the biggest problem might be that cooking
*28:47.900- 28:49.660* :  is about a human sense of trust
*28:49.660- 28:50.940* :  in our favourite chefs.
*28:51.380- 28:53.660* :  A tough place for robots to muscle in on the action.
*28:54.440- 28:56.800* :  But AI is certainly trying to make his mark.
*28:57.520- 28:59.240* :  That report by Alfie Habeson.
*28:59.740- 29:01.780* :  Returning now to our top story,
*29:01.780- 29:03.400* :  the search for people in the water
*29:03.400- 29:04.580* :  in the port of Baltimore
*29:04.580- 29:06.440* :  after a bridge collapse when it was hit
*29:06.440- 29:08.660* :  by a container ship in the early hours.
*29:09.000- 29:10.160* :  The owner of the Dali,
*29:10.160- 29:12.260* :  which sails under a Singaporean flag,
*29:12.660- 29:13.900* :  say all crew members,
*29:14.120- 29:15.580* :  including the two pilots on board,
*29:15.580- 29:16.580* :  have been accounted for.
*29:17.060- 29:18.400* :  Our business reporter in Singapore,
*29:18.400- 29:21.060* :  Katie Silver, has been talking to the vessel's owners.
*29:21.680- 29:24.040* :  There's shipping companies in a gene marine group.
*29:24.080- 29:26.800* :  It's got about 668 vessels around the world.
*29:27.220- 29:29.260* :  The official spokesperson for the company
*29:29.480- 29:31.420* :  told me that it was an all-Indian crew
*29:31.420- 29:33.160* :  about 22 people on board.
*29:33.580- 29:36.460* :  They've also told us that two members of the company's US team
*29:36.460- 29:38.880* :  are currently en route to Baltimore to investigate
*29:39.400- 29:40.780* :  from both Miami and Oklahoma,
*29:41.480- 29:44.240* :  and that it was indeed unusual to have an incident like this,
*29:44.380- 29:46.640* :  given that there were these two pilots on board.
*29:46.760- 29:48.580* :  It's also a particularly popular port
*29:48.620- 29:49.900* :  where it comes to car shipments,
*29:49.900- 29:50.740* :  which as you can imagine,
*29:50.800- 29:53.480* :  are then going to be big vessels like this one,
*29:53.480- 29:54.900* :  which were about 300 meters.
*29:54.900- 29:57.980* :  Now, one Singapore-based shipping expert I spoke with
*29:58.280- 30:00.680* :  said that there's a very extensive departure checklist
*30:00.680- 30:02.440* :  that these vessels have to go through
*30:02.440- 30:03.580* :  before they leave ports.
*30:03.980- 30:05.580* :  And he said, if everything was done,
*30:05.700- 30:07.580* :  then something was clearly overlooked.
*30:08.140- 30:11.280* :  We're also already seeing the impact when it comes to shipping.
*30:11.280- 30:12.720* :  So another expert, for example,
*30:13.140- 30:14.800* :  has been telling the BBC that it's going to create
*30:14.800- 30:17.360* :  significant problems on the US East Coast
*30:17.720- 30:19.580* :  for both importers and exporters.
*30:19.580- 30:23.720* :  Already, we know, for example, about 21,000 units of cargo
*30:23.720- 30:25.240* :  are going to need to be diverted.
*30:25.700- 30:27.400* :  Many vessels all but trapped in the port
*30:27.420- 30:28.600* :  because of this disruption.
*30:29.100- 30:30.660* :  And in fact, 10 commercial ships
*30:30.660- 30:31.780* :  who are heading to Baltimore
*30:32.260- 30:33.460* :  have already dropped their anchors.
*30:33.460- 30:35.220* :  This is going to come with delays,
*30:35.620- 30:37.520* :  added costs for the region,
*30:37.520- 30:39.820* :  although it's unlikely really that we're going to see
*30:39.820- 30:42.280* :  a significant global impact when it comes to the shipping industry.
*30:42.600- 30:44.560* :  Our Singapore Business Reporter Katie Silver.
*30:47.440- 30:48.720* :  And that is all from us for now,
*30:48.720- 30:51.240* :  but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*30:51.240- 30:54.180* :  This edition was mixed by Vlodomir Muzetska
*30:54.180- 30:55.880* :  and produced by Nikki Veriko,
*30:56.120- 30:57.240* :  our editor's Karen Martin.
*30:57.420- 30:58.220* :  I'm Oliver Conway.
*30:58.540- 30:59.520* :  Until next time, goodbye.
*31:11.320- 31:13.320* :  I'm Katya Adler from the Global Story podcast,
*31:13.320- 31:16.500* :  where we're looking at the tiny country of Guyana,
*31:16.980- 31:19.760* :  which is the fastest growing economy in the world.
*31:20.580- 31:24.800* :  But will newfound oil reserves be a windfall or their downfall?
*31:25.440- 31:25.880* :  Curious?
*31:25.880- 31:29.220* :  The Global Story brings you fresh takes and smart perspectives
*31:29.220- 31:31.140* :  from BBC journalists around the world.
