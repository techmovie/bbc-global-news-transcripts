*02:00.000- 02:05.040* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway, we're recording this at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday the 27th
*02:05.040- 02:10.680* :  March. Thailand becomes the first Southeast Asian country to pass a marriage equality bill.
*02:11.360- 02:16.360* :  Investigators in the US recover the data recorder from the ship that destroyed a bridge in Baltimore.
*02:17.100- 02:24.020* :  And to top EU officials as Europe will continue to support Ukraine but needs to step up its own defence production.
*02:26.720- 02:33.100* :  Also in the podcast, the authorities in the Australian town of Alice Springs order young people off the streets at night.
*02:33.100- 02:39.880* :  And later, their hips are split because they're on horseback and they're clearly practicing and shooting bows and arrows
*02:40.020- 02:43.260* :  because they have deformities to their fingers and to the muscle remains.
*02:43.840- 02:48.360* :  Did the Amazonian women fighters of Greek mythology really exist?
*02:52.420- 02:56.860* :  Apart from Nepal and Taiwan, same-sex weddings are barred across Asia.
*02:57.460- 03:04.320* :  Now Thailand is bucking the trend becoming the first nation in Southeast Asia to allow LGBTQ plus couples
*03:04.320- 03:06.620* :  to have their marriages legally recognized.
*03:06.620- 03:10.860* :  The lower house of the Thai parliament approved the move by a big majority.
*03:21.440- 03:24.500* :  Some politicians waived rainbow flags in the chamber.
*03:24.700- 03:28.520* :  Rattanatada is an equality campaigner in Thailand.
*03:32.700- 03:39.040* :  Thailand is going to finally be accepted and truly recognized as the paradise for LGBTQ rights
*03:39.620- 03:43.180* :  because we have past equal marriage, a mean in the near future.
*03:44.220- 03:50.200* :  The marriage bill still has to be endorsed by the Senate and the King but is expected to become law before the end of the year.
*03:50.720- 03:56.180* :  It reinforces Thailand's reputation as one of Asia's most liberal societies in some areas,
*03:56.780- 04:00.560* :  even as it maintains the tradition of conservative values in others.
*04:00.620- 04:07.600* :  I asked our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head what it means for same-sex couples in Thailand and beyond.
*04:07.620- 04:11.660* :  It's such a big moment for them and I think for people across the region as well.
*04:12.120- 04:16.280* :  It's not just about being able to get married and have it legally recognized
*04:16.480- 04:19.040* :  and all of the legal implications that go with that.
*04:19.060- 04:23.560* :  There are all sorts of problems in a region which still values traditional marriage.
*04:23.560- 04:27.920* :  If your marriage is not recognized when it comes to inheritance, the rights over children,
*04:28.460- 04:30.360* :  all these things come with it but more than that.
*04:30.840- 04:34.540* :  I think there was a very important statement by one of the people on the committee today
*04:34.540- 04:36.960* :  saying we're not granting rights, we're returning them.
*04:37.460- 04:43.620* :  What they meant was equality and rights access to rights should always have been there
*04:43.660- 04:50.220* :  and that it was wrong that LGBTQ plus and other communities were unable to have these rights.
*04:50.240- 04:55.660* :  I think that sense that a long injustice has been ended and that full rights have been restored
*04:55.660- 04:59.940* :  has given a great sense of achievement to those who have been campaigning for it
*05:00.300- 05:06.920* :  and encouragement to other LGBTQ campaigners across the region in other countries
*05:06.920- 05:10.800* :  where they've got much, much further to go before getting this kind of recognition.
*05:11.400- 05:13.920* :  What does this say about tie society?
*05:14.980- 05:18.140* :  I think on this issue, Thailand has always been pretty open.
*05:18.140- 05:25.940* :  On these sorts of issues on gender and I gender identity, Thailand is famous for being open-minded.
*05:25.940- 05:31.920* :  I remember when I first came to Thailand, one of the very first stories I did 23 years ago
*05:32.280- 05:36.500* :  was looking at a transgender beauty contest which was broadcast nationally.
*05:36.500- 05:40.580* :  It was a completely accepted mainstream event that was eye-opening for me then.
*05:40.820- 05:47.940* :  Everyone knows that Thailand has a very open and accommodating attitude to people of gender diversity
*05:49.040- 05:52.600* :  but the laws move slowly here and the legal status has taken a long time to catch up.
*05:52.600- 05:58.620* :  It was particularly frustrating I think for campaigners who believed they were close to getting the laws passed last year
*05:58.620- 06:02.620* :  but parliament moved so slowly here and they couldn't get it done before the election last year
*06:02.700- 06:05.300* :  so that's delayed the whole thing by a year.
*06:05.520- 06:10.080* :  There has been a broad consensus politically in Thailand that this is the right way to go
*06:10.080- 06:12.940* :  with very few people opposed to it for a very long time.
*06:12.980- 06:18.580* :  That's not to say that there aren't still some very conservative views in other areas in Thailand
*06:18.600- 06:22.600* :  of course most famously on the monarchy is one area where there's not much tolerance
*06:22.600- 06:27.560* :  but on this one I think everyone expected Thailand to be the first in Southeast Asia
*06:27.560- 06:28.680* :  and it's shown that it is.
*06:29.240- 06:30.520* :  Jonathan Heard in Bangkok.
*06:31.400- 06:39.320* :  A day after a bridge collapsed in the US port of Baltimore, investigators say they've recovered the data recorder from the ship that crashed into it.
*06:39.860- 06:45.200* :  Six men working on the bridge are now presumed dead after divers fail to locate them in the freezing water.
*06:45.200- 06:52.600* :  The port, one of the busiest in America, remains closed and a key transit route along the eastern seaboard is blocked.
*06:52.600- 06:56.060* :  We'll have the latest on the investigation into what happened in a moment
*06:56.620- 06:59.180* :  but first this report from Tom Bateman in Baltimore.
*06:59.980- 07:03.180* :  Any one of you guys on the south side, one of you guys on the north side?
*07:03.180- 07:08.740* :  An extraordinary call on the police radio in the transit lane to one of America's biggest ports.
*07:09.500- 07:14.040* :  As the container ship Dali loses power about to drift into the bridge,
*07:14.660- 07:17.540* :  police scramble to stop the traffic over it.
*07:18.140- 07:19.600* :  It may have saved many lives.
*07:27.040- 07:31.720* :  The bridge was part of the Baltimore Beltway, an artery of life in this port city.
*07:32.100- 07:33.520* :  Thousands work on the docks.
*07:33.880- 07:38.300* :  Now the cargo is stranded and a way of life is at a standstill.
*07:40.220- 07:45.900* :  The last U.S. Coast Guard hovered above and looking out over the Patapsco River,
*07:45.900- 07:48.880* :  the entire central section is gone.
*07:49.420- 07:58.080* :  I'm looking at two triangular shapes jutting out of the water of wreckage of twisted pylons and these steel beams
*07:58.080- 08:05.660* :  that were the tower sections of the bridge now just two triangular shapes jutting from the water.
*08:06.560- 08:12.600* :  And next to them a 300 meter container ship which is wedged up against one of the supporting pillars.
*08:14.140- 08:20.280* :  I'd like to announce tonight that based on the length of time that we've gone in the search,
*08:20.280- 08:23.040* :  the extensive search efforts that we've put into it,
*08:23.720- 08:30.880* :  the water temperature that at this point we do not believe that we're going to find any of these individuals still alive.
*08:31.580- 08:36.560* :  Late last night the police said that in the freezing waters of the river they'd called off the search
*08:37.080- 08:39.820* :  for the six construction workers who fell with the bridge.
*08:40.860- 08:46.880* :  It's dramatic. I'm born and raised in Baltimore. I've gone over that bridge a thousand times
*08:46.880- 08:53.520* :  and to see how waterways without it rising above it is just absolutely surprising.
*08:54.100- 08:56.940* :  Nick Mosby is the president of Baltimore City Council.
*08:57.260- 09:03.560* :  But I think the trauma behind is knowing that folks lost their lives trying to fix it.
*09:03.880- 09:07.040* :  It's some symbolic symbol that's his working class community.
*09:07.040- 09:11.680* :  It's access to jobs, it's access to open mobility and education
*09:11.800- 09:17.760* :  and really connects this part of the city to describe as maybe the central business district.
*09:19.260- 09:23.040* :  God be free right now that you be the bridge that we don't have.
*09:24.780- 09:28.720* :  At the Mount Olive Baptist Church, they praise the recovery workers
*09:29.280- 09:32.040* :  and a community comes together despite the odds.
*09:36.280- 09:42.900* :  In a polarized America, sometimes searching for tangible positives among a tangle of angry voices,
*09:43.540- 09:47.940* :  this was a bridge everyone knew, a fixture of an industrial past,
*09:48.580- 09:52.660* :  raising livelihoods and spanning a divide, and now it's gone.
*10:01.040- 10:06.680* :  My name is Muriel Gray with the Girl Scouts and St. Matthew's United Methodist Church.
*10:08.000- 10:12.320* :  Do you think where we're standing here? I mean, you used to be able to see the bridge across here.
*10:12.320- 10:13.220* :  I used to cross that bridge all the time.
*10:14.040- 10:17.500* :  And if we pull together, we can get that bridge back up there before four years.
*10:18.460- 10:23.760* :  But we got to pull out resources together and put out arms together and work together.
*10:24.300- 10:31.180* :  A colleague of the men who died say they came to the US to work from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.
*10:31.860- 10:33.880* :  They were fixing potholes when they fell.
*10:33.880- 10:37.660* :  Some leave behind wives and children abroad, says a friend.
*10:38.520- 10:42.340* :  The police said the search had become too perilous and was abandoned
*10:43.000- 10:45.700* :  amid the changing currents and dangerous debris.
*10:46.300- 10:48.880* :  Tom Bateman and just before we recorded this podcast,
*10:48.880- 10:54.080* :  I got an update from Tom about the theory from the National Transportation Safety Board
*10:54.500- 10:58.240* :  that dirty fuel may have caused the cargo ship to lose power.
*10:58.880- 11:01.920* :  Yeah, they managed to board the ship along with the Coast Guard,
*11:01.920- 11:03.400* :  so they have the data recorder.
*11:04.000- 11:08.800* :  And yes, that was the comment from the chair of the NTSP Transport Safety Board
*11:09.420- 11:12.080* :  who talked about this possibility of dirty fuel.
*11:12.260- 11:16.180* :  Now, what Maritime experts say is that if fuel becomes contaminated,
*11:16.240- 11:19.240* :  it can cause problems with the ship's main generator.
*11:19.240- 11:22.800* :  And that can be a cause for power blackouts.
*11:23.280- 11:27.320* :  It is now clear that that's what had taken place on the ship.
*11:27.340- 11:30.360* :  That's been confirmed by the American Pilots Association.
*11:31.020- 11:34.140* :  Two of their pilots were in control of the ship at the time.
*11:34.480- 11:37.180* :  It seems they acted pretty fast to try and stop the ship.
*11:37.220- 11:42.520* :  They said that they dropped an anchor and tried to steer the ship hard to the left.
*11:42.540- 11:46.200* :  And it was that Mayday call that it seems stock traffic on the bridge
*11:46.600- 11:47.780* :  and may have saved many lives.
*11:48.340- 11:49.840* :  Tom Bateman in Baltimore.
*11:50.920- 11:52.260* :  When the Cold War ended,
*11:52.560- 11:55.220* :  many European countries cut their defense budgets
*11:55.220- 11:57.600* :  and enjoyed the so-called peace dividend.
*11:57.620- 12:01.580* :  There were further cuts after the 2008 financial crisis.
*12:02.160- 12:04.460* :  Troop numbers and supplies dwindled.
*12:04.980- 12:09.060* :  It all meant Europe was unprepared for war when Russia invaded Ukraine.
*12:09.060- 12:11.740* :  The president of the European Council, Charles Michel,
*12:11.740- 12:14.820* :  has now told the BBC that that needs to change.
*12:15.380- 12:17.700* :  It is the war launched by Russia against Ukraine.
*12:18.140- 12:22.220* :  There are also various threats at the world level.
*12:22.940- 12:25.240* :  The EU needs to be adapted.
*12:25.240- 12:27.640* :  Probably today we are too fragmented.
*12:28.100- 12:32.100* :  At EU, for example, we are supporting Ukraine a lot with military equipment.
*12:32.600- 12:36.160* :  But more than 70 percent of these military equipment for Ukraine
*12:36.680- 12:40.100* :  is produced outside of the EU in the future.
*12:40.580- 12:45.920* :  We need to produce more to have more capabilities in the field in the future.
*12:46.720- 12:52.340* :  Defense analyst Jonathan Marcus told me more about the thinking behind Europe's renewed focus on defense.
*12:53.080- 12:56.140* :  It's being pushed really by three very urgent factors.
*12:56.700- 13:00.900* :  One clearly is the hold-up in USAID for Ukraine.
*13:00.900- 13:04.360* :  The regular tranches of aid that have been given to Ukraine
*13:04.760- 13:09.580* :  are now halted by the Republicans at former President Trump's behest.
*13:10.040- 13:12.600* :  Ukraine itself is an increasingly perilous position.
*13:12.600- 13:19.400* :  It's losing ground slowly because it's not getting sufficient supplies of weaponry and particularly ammunition.
*13:20.140- 13:26.440* :  But also thirdly, of course, the potential arrival of Mr Trump back in office in the White House,
*13:26.960- 13:31.120* :  who's indicated that he's quite happy to throw Ukraine to the wolves.
*13:31.580- 13:38.240* :  But I think the Europeans are increasingly worried now that what they see as a belligerent and relentless Russia
*13:38.780- 13:42.580* :  is increasingly not just a threat to Ukraine and countries close to it,
*13:42.580- 13:45.240* :  but to maybe NATO countries as well.
*13:45.240- 13:51.600* :  And with the prospect of America not being there for square behind NATO, standing behind Europe,
*13:51.620- 13:56.940* :  there's a growing belief that the Europeans have to do more to fulfill their own defense.
*13:57.500- 14:03.140* :  So if I had this call from that senior EU figure, France has also been talking tough,
*14:03.140- 14:08.960* :  but is everyone within the EU on board and how easy will it be for Europe to develop its own defense industry?
*14:09.700- 14:13.920* :  It's not going to be easy. I think there is certainly a change in the mood for President Macron.
*14:13.920- 14:16.500* :  You mentioned correctly as an important factor in that.
*14:17.160- 14:20.100* :  The difficulty is that there are many difficulties.
*14:20.520- 14:24.900* :  One is that countries don't produce arms, companies produce arms.
*14:24.900- 14:30.840* :  And if they are going to increase production lines and expand production so on, they need certainty.
*14:30.840- 14:38.460* :  The money has to come from somewhere, and we know the dire economic situation in many NATO countries in Western Europe.
*14:39.100- 14:46.500* :  Also, of course, there's the difficulty that they need to sort of produce stuff in a more coherent way,
*14:46.500- 14:52.080* :  the way they arm themselves, the choices of equipment, the commonality of equipment and so on.
*14:52.300- 14:57.320* :  I mean, you've even gone an extent to which a couple of Baltic governments have been calling for NATO countries
*14:57.320- 15:00.280* :  to look again maybe at reintroducing conscription.
*15:00.640- 15:05.440* :  I don't think that's going to happen, but I think there is a growing mood now that the world is changing.
*15:05.440- 15:11.480* :  The difficulty is that words are easy, money is hard, and countries like Germany who could be a key player
*15:12.000- 15:14.300* :  are rather dithering and drifting.
*15:14.300- 15:20.360* :  There has to be, I think, a clear understanding that the aim is to defeat Russia in Ukraine,
*15:20.360- 15:24.980* :  not just to ensure that Ukrainians could hang on indefinitely.
*15:25.380- 15:26.760* :  Defence analyst Jonathan Marcus.
*15:27.620- 15:33.540* :  A European firm which built a flying car has sold the technology that powered it to a Chinese company.
*15:33.540- 15:38.600* :  The air car drives like a normal vehicle but can unfold a set of wings within two minutes.
*15:38.620- 15:44.520* :  It flew for more than half an hour in 2021, so a climate is the BBC's technology editor.
*15:45.020- 15:52.840* :  The air car takes just over two minutes to extend its spoiler and unfold a set of wings as it transforms from a car into an aircraft.
*15:52.840- 15:56.040* :  It contains a BMW engine and runs on petrol.
*15:56.040- 15:59.540* :  It can seat two passengers and fly around 600 miles.
*15:59.620- 16:02.540* :  On the road, it operates like a standard vehicle.
*16:03.040- 16:08.100* :  Klein Vision, the Slovakian firm which invented it, refused to reveal the cost of its tech licence.
*16:08.140- 16:14.220* :  The Chinese buyer says it plans to manufacture new vehicles for use in an unspecified area of China.
*16:14.880- 16:22.880* :  Many countries are keen to introduce airborne personal transport with the most common design being drone-like carriers which take off and land vertically.

*17:04.740- 17:06.860* :  A nation in the grip of criminal gangs.
*17:07.220- 17:11.140* :  How bad does it have to get before the international community reacts?
*17:11.580- 17:13.560* :  A country showing signs of fracture.
*17:13.740- 17:16.640* :  Right now it's done. Things are really quite dark.
*17:16.640- 17:20.020* :  The nation is divided. The mistrusts ran so deep.
*17:20.340- 17:24.340* :  The global jigsaw from the BBC World Service is back for a new series.

*18:07.280- 18:12.500* :  I'm Katya Adler from the Global Story Podcast where we're looking at the tiny country of Guyana,
*18:12.920- 18:15.760* :  which is the fastest growing economy in the world.
*18:15.760- 18:20.800* :  But will newfound oil reserves be a windfall or their downfall?
*18:21.420- 18:27.080* :  Curious? The global story brings you fresh takes and smart perspectives from BBC journalists around the world.
*18:27.600- 18:29.840* :  Find us wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:39.260- 18:45.080* :  Alice Springs in the heart of the Australian Outback has imposed a curfew on all under 18s.
*18:45.400- 18:49.400* :  For two weeks they're not being allowed in the town centre at night following a spate of unrest.
*18:49.960- 18:51.980* :  Eva Lawler is the Territories Chief Minister.
*18:52.720- 18:56.500* :  I'm fed up with this appalling level of crime and anti-social behaviour.
*18:56.960- 18:59.520* :  The community has had enough and so have I.
*19:00.220- 19:04.180* :  If someone is under the age of 18 and they're seen out in the town centre,
*19:04.280- 19:07.120* :  they will be taken home or taken to a safe place.
*19:07.880- 19:08.960* :  But enough is enough.
*19:09.560- 19:13.660* :  I heard more about the trouble in Alice Springs from our Asia Pacific Editor, Celia Hatton.
*19:14.060- 19:21.160* :  This curfew that you just mentioned, it's going to be in place from 6pm every night until 6am.
*19:21.160- 19:26.820* :  Everyone under the age of 18 is expected to stay inside during the curfew.
*19:26.820- 19:29.840* :  And it's what top officials are calling a circuit breaker.
*19:29.840- 19:38.700* :  They're hoping that this will sort of reset the tempo inside the town following a really serious surge in violence.
*19:38.800- 19:46.800* :  That came after the death of an 18 year old who died when an allegedly stolen car he was in crashed.
*19:46.800- 19:49.920* :  That led to some sort of family feud.
*19:50.880- 19:57.560* :  And then following his funeral, some family members went to a pub in the centre of the town.
*19:57.620- 20:04.860* :  70 people, mostly people under the age of 18 attacked the pub with rocks and bricks.
*20:04.880- 20:11.420* :  There are also other altercation brawls around the town, including police say, up to 150 people.
*20:11.860- 20:19.120* :  And that's really led to the imposition of this curfew system, quite shocking scenes in Alice Springs on Tuesday.
*20:19.120- 20:24.060* :  Our officials are hoping for a real reset now with this curfew.
*20:24.200- 20:29.040* :  Yeah, Alice Springs right in the middle of the country, a bit of a tourist magnet. What is going on there?
*20:29.560- 20:34.440* :  Well, you know, this is generations of extreme poverty in Alice Springs.
*20:34.440- 20:39.440* :  You know, there are some people who benefit from the tourist trade. It's a very beautiful part of Australia.
*20:40.300- 20:49.200* :  But there are, there's a serious lack of education, employment opportunities, generation upon generation experiencing extreme poverty.
*20:49.200- 20:54.980* :  You know, it has 12 times the national average rate of homelessness there in Alice Springs.
*20:54.980- 21:02.820* :  And so many people say they just feel hopeless and there's really led to sort of a breakdown in authority and children
*21:03.280- 21:09.260* :  under the age of 18 really responding to wanting to go to school and wanting to listen to authority.
*21:09.260- 21:17.280* :  And so that's why we've had the mayor of Alice Springs for quite some months now calling for the federal police to come in and restore order.
*21:17.660- 21:21.240* :  And so he's really relieved that this curfew is going to be in place.
*21:21.640- 21:23.300* :  And I was talking to Celia Hatten there.
*21:23.980- 21:30.020* :  Cobalt is a critical component in much modern technology, most notably in rechargeable batteries.
*21:30.740- 21:36.360* :  70% of the world's known reserves of the metal are found in the Democratic Republic of Congo in Central Africa.
*21:36.360- 21:42.720* :  But a new report suggests that Cobalt extraction there is having a major impact on health and the environment.
*21:42.720- 21:49.220* :  Investigation comes from Raid, the UK-based organisation which describes itself as a corporate watchdog.
*21:50.000- 21:52.760* :  Its legal researcher is Anis Tobalagba.
*21:53.280- 22:00.320* :  A claim of the industry is that Cobalt mind industrially is cleaned and more sustainable.
*22:00.960- 22:09.720* :  But our research is showing that the environmental and human rights impacts of Cobalt mining are actually devastating for Congolese communities.
*22:10.400- 22:17.440* :  And we know from scientific studies that copper and Cobalt mining is an extremely polluting industry.
*22:17.440- 22:23.040* :  It pollutes the air, it pollutes water, which is the focus of our research, it pollutes soils.
*22:23.900- 22:32.900* :  And those we interviewed for our research strongly believe that water contamination from industrial mining activities is harming their health.
*22:33.440- 22:43.220* :  And a striking finding of our research is 56% of the people we interviewed said that women are increasingly experiencing
*22:43.620- 22:45.960* :  gynecological and reproductive issues.
*22:46.620- 22:54.440* :  So we're talking about irregular menstruations, infections, but also more miscarriages and in some cases these birth defects.
*22:55.280- 23:00.260* :  And it seems that more and more young girls and teenagers are affected.
*23:00.780- 23:07.700* :  All these women associate these conditions with their using contaminated water from the local lakes and rivers.
*23:08.720- 23:16.660* :  So one of our main recommendations is making potable drinking water accessible for populations.
*23:17.620- 23:25.760* :  The surface water is polluted, the groundwater is depleted by mining activities that need a lot of water to operate.
*23:26.420- 23:38.500* :  So really, we need companies to provide the minimum WHO standard of 20 liters per day to make sure that I've access to the minimum required.
*23:39.100- 23:41.480* :  Nice, Tobal Agba of RAID.
*23:42.200- 23:50.420* :  This time yesterday on the Global News Podcast, we heard how the latest candidate of Venezuela's main opposition coalition had been blocked from July's election.
*23:50.880- 23:55.720* :  She was the second opposition figure to be prevented from standing against President Nicholas Maduro.
*23:56.440- 24:03.440* :  Now the opposition is trying for a third time, putting forward a political scientist and former diplomat called Edmundo González.
*24:03.940- 24:06.980* :  I heard more from our Latin America editor, Vanessa Bouchluta.
*24:07.580- 24:09.820* :  Well, it was a surprise development, that's for sure.
*24:09.820- 24:21.020* :  So the electoral council suddenly extended the deadline for registering candidates by 12 hours, which gave, as you said, the opposition coalition a chance to put forward Edmundo González.
*24:21.640- 24:32.300* :  But it has to be said that the coalition of opposition parties seems to be planning to maybe replace Edmundo González with a better known candidate.
*24:32.300- 24:38.960* :  They can do that. They've got to the 20th of April to change the name on the ballot.
*24:38.960- 24:48.160* :  So Edmundo González was put forward almost like a placeholder so that the opposition has got a place to run against the President Maduro.
*24:48.620- 24:53.500* :  But they will now put their heads together and probably decide who that person should be.
*24:53.900- 24:56.460* :  So it's unlikely it will be Edmundo González himself.
*24:56.940- 25:00.360* :  That's just the name that they put forward for the time being.
*25:00.360- 25:08.140* :  He's somebody who is a former diplomat who is not controversial, but it's very likely that the final name on the ballot will be a different one.
*25:08.380- 25:14.960* :  But once they settle on that final name, won't they face the same problems getting that person approved by the government?
*25:15.660- 25:21.740* :  There is a very distinct possibility that there will be further hurdles along the path to the elections.
*25:22.420- 25:33.340* :  As you mentioned, the first two candidates were BARD. There have also been massive arrests of campaign officials from the main opposition parties.
*25:33.340- 25:45.120* :  So the government is doing everything it can to block the opposition party from having a good chance to run against Mr. Maduro.
*25:45.540- 25:49.560* :  And it will be interesting to see what strategy they come up with next.
*25:50.180- 25:59.740* :  Vanessa Bouchlouta. In Greek legends, the Amazons were feared female warriors famed for their male-free society and skill with a bow and arrow.
*26:00.400- 26:08.000* :  But did they actually exist? Well, archaeologists excavating sites in Azerbaijan are discovering increasing evidence that they did.
*26:08.860- 26:12.200* :  Historian Bettany Hughes has been telling Martha Carney about the find.
*26:12.760- 26:22.480* :  It's women buried around two and a half thousand years ago with high status objects, so maceheads and these beautiful carneilian necklaces and crucially weapons.
*26:23.080- 26:30.500* :  So quivers of arrows, these beautiful arrowheads made of volcanic glass, and they're all showing signs of attacks.
*26:30.520- 26:34.140* :  So we think that these were professional female soldiers.
*26:34.680- 26:39.420* :  So these weren't just ornamental weapons being buried alongside them, they were actually being used.
*26:39.460- 26:48.080* :  And that's been significant particularly if there's evidence of archery, because that's what the women warriors in the Iliad, you know, they were famous for being archers, weren't they?
*26:48.080- 26:52.920* :  Exactly, that's what the Greeks said about the Amazons. The Greeks are very rude about the Amazons, I should say.
*26:53.280- 27:00.460* :  They either describe them as virgins or having these kind of voracious sexual appetites, and it's usually because the Greeks are in battle against them.
*27:00.740- 27:10.500* :  But if you look at the sources from the east, from places like Armenia and the Caucasus, then we hear about these women who are just soldiers and queens who go out to battle.
*27:11.040- 27:18.000* :  There's actually other graves as well in Armenia. There was one that was discovered a couple of years ago where you have a woman from a very similar time.
*27:18.000- 27:27.600* :  Again, she's a professional warrior clearly, because you can actually see the arrowheads which are lodged in her bones, and she's been patched up and sent back out to fight.
*27:27.620- 27:38.120* :  So, yeah, they're definitely not myth, they're definitely real. And just to say, they definitely didn't have one breast, which is the thing that the Greeks also say about the Amazons.
*27:38.120- 27:45.600* :  They kind of make up this etymology and say it's a matzos, it means she's a breast away, they've definitely got both.
*27:45.600- 27:49.020* :  Yeah, the idea was that the breast was cut off so that they could pull their bows, doesn't it?
*27:49.620- 28:01.760* :  That's complete nonsense, but what you do see in the human remains is the humoral muscle and the fingers are really bent because it shows that actually they were using bows and arrows almost permanently.
*28:01.760- 28:11.040* :  Their hips are split because they're on horseback and they're clearly practicing and shooting bows and arrows because they have deformities to their fingers and to the muscle remains.
*28:11.240- 28:13.560* :  And what does it tell us about those societies?
*28:14.100- 28:32.500* :  Well, that women had status and standing and that they fought not just alongside the men, but often instead of the men, and I had the most fascinating conversation in this very remote village called Kinelik, which one of the highest occupied villages in the Caucasus, with three generations of women.
*28:33.040- 28:54.940* :  I sort of said, do you tell each other stories of these warriors thinking it might be a myth, and they looked at me slightly strangely and said, that's not a myth, that's what our grandmothers were doing, that they were covering their faces, the women, riding down from the mountains because the men were away herding sheep, and women would fight instead of men, which is exactly what we hear from the ancient sources too.
*28:55.460- 29:06.480* :  Historian Bettany Hughes. Finally, Paddle is said to be the world's fastest growing sport, filling courts across the globe and attracting investment from celebrities and major brands.
*29:07.140- 29:20.160* :  According to the International Paddle Federation, it's now played at more than 19,000 clubs in 130 countries. So what is it about the sport that makes it so popular? Daniel Rosni takes to the court to find out.
*29:21.720- 29:29.160* :  Okay, I'm really glad this is where the area is because I've, I have many points of I lost that too. Two straight away, gone.
*29:29.940- 29:37.520* :  What is Paddle and how do you play it? I've somehow managed to get someone who's very good at it to teach me.
*29:37.820- 29:46.700* :  Hiya, I'm TN Autumn, I'm age 20 and I'm the current British number one female number one in Paddle tennis. So Paddle is always played in doubles.
*29:47.140- 29:53.120* :  In very simple terms, I would say Paddle is a combination of tennis and squash in the same sport.
*29:53.860- 30:00.380* :  And it's about three quarters of the size of a tennis court. You have a net in the middle, so hitting the ball over the net.
*30:00.880- 30:06.220* :  But you also have walls all around you. The ball has to hit the floor before it touches any of the walls.
*30:06.220- 30:11.940* :  And then you have to hit it off the wall before it bounces again. You can volley, you can smash.
*30:12.200- 30:17.620* :  It's an underarm serve cross court, so different to tennis. I think that pretty much covers the basics of it.
*30:20.960- 30:23.700* :  So I got a point then. I got one point.
*30:24.200- 30:28.420* :  I'm Michael Grayden, I'm one of the co-founders of the Chief Executive of Game for Paddle.
*30:28.540- 30:33.460* :  We're the largest paddle operator in the UK and still the only national paddle operator in the UK.
*30:33.460- 30:37.380* :  And we're also running venues in Spain, Australia and New Zealand.
*30:37.580- 30:41.380* :  We've got at least eight or nine venues that we're looking at in Australia and New Zealand right now.
*30:41.380- 30:45.680* :  And getting approaches from all over the far east. So there are many, many opportunities.
*30:46.360- 30:47.960* :  The US is another obvious market.
*30:48.620- 30:51.420* :  The court fee per hour depends on the venue and location.
*30:51.420- 30:58.360* :  The one Michael and I were out in southwest London was £50 an hour, which is roughly $64 US dollars.
*30:58.980- 31:01.880* :  Each game has four players, so the cost can be shared.
*31:02.480- 31:06.580* :  But money wasn't an issue for the person who brought the sport to Europe.
*31:10.940- 31:17.300* :  It was in 1969 in Mexico when a rich businessman called Enrique Corquera created Paddle.
*31:17.780- 31:21.660* :  It's thought he didn't have enough room at his holiday home for a full tennis court.
*31:22.220- 31:28.980* :  So he thought of something similar, smaller, and built walls around it to stop the ball going further afield.
*31:29.620- 31:39.100* :  Five years later, one of his friends, a Spanish prince, came to play and loved it so much he introduced it to the wealthy area of Marbella when he went home.
*31:39.580- 31:43.800* :  A similar visit from an Argentinian millionaire helped develop it in South America.
*31:44.420- 31:51.800* :  Now, sports stars like David Beckham, Virgil Van Dyke and Serena Williams are keen paddle players after seeing the sport grow.
*31:52.420- 31:57.200* :  Other celebrities like Daddy Yankee and Justin Timberlake are also investing in it.
*31:57.240- 32:02.880* :  It's leading professional tour, Premier Paddle, which is owned by Qatar Sports Investments, QSI,
*32:02.880- 32:10.040* :  has just signed a partnership with the energy drinks company Red Bull, believed to be worth tens of millions of dollars.
*32:10.700- 32:19.160* :  It's a significant investment, which includes broadcasting rights for matches, as well as play a sponsorship until at least the end of 2027.
*32:19.160- 32:25.980* :  It's clearly a fast growing sport, a fast growing industry, and to those actually playing it,
*32:26.480- 32:28.640* :  it's becoming a fast growing addiction.
*32:29.420- 32:34.720* :  My name is Emma. My name is Amy. I originally was a tennis player and just played as a hobby.
*32:34.980- 32:41.020* :  My brother actually got me into paddle. He said, I've started this new game, it's a really, really good fun and really addictive.
*32:41.020- 32:43.920* :  You should come play. That was it, really. I was hooked.
*32:44.460- 32:48.840* :  Very similar. Play tennis in the past. A friend said, come on, have a go.
*32:48.840- 32:53.640* :  I came. I hadn't really left. Absolutely love it.
*32:54.040- 32:57.000* :  Some paddle players ending that report by Daniel Rosni.
*32:59.180- 33:03.360* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*33:03.660- 33:07.000* :  This edition was mixed by Chris Guzaris and produced by Tracy Gordon.
*33:07.000- 33:11.500* :  Our editor is Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.

*33:28.460- 33:31.340* :  which is the fastest growing economy in the world.
