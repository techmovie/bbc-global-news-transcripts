*01:09.840- 01:10.540* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*01:10.540- 01:14.520* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*01:14.880- 01:15.860* :  They charge you a lot.
*01:15.860- 01:17.180* :  We charge you a little.
*01:17.500- 01:21.100* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*01:21.140- 01:24.900* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*01:25.220- 01:28.400* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month

*01:42.560- 01:46.160* :  Unfortunately, I think we all live in a world where the bad news sells.
*01:46.440- 01:47.960* :  It's not the good stuff that's being heard.
*01:48.160- 01:51.160* :  It's almost like my wish, my hope that going forward,
*01:51.340- 01:54.280* :  we start focused on the positive and not so much on the bad.
*01:54.980- 01:59.880* :  A call to action for more good news stories from this American country music star.
*02:00.300- 02:03.860* :  I'm Jordan Davis, and this is the happy part from the BBC World Service.
*02:08.160- 02:09.420* :  Hello, I'm Harry Bly.
*02:09.420- 02:13.760* :  This week, we also hear from the team bringing online education offline
*02:13.760- 02:15.420* :  to children in Senegal.
*02:15.920- 02:18.260* :  In the box is a small portable server.
*02:18.920- 02:21.120* :  Anyone nearby can connect their tablet computer,
*02:21.720- 02:24.160* :  phone or laptop and start browsing.
*02:25.160- 02:26.980* :  The bright orange baby monkey.
*02:27.460- 02:30.240* :  It's quite odd because they almost look like they don't belong.
*02:31.220- 02:34.800* :  Born at a zoo here in the UK, and speaking of babies,
*02:34.800- 02:36.140* :  it's a reddoctor on board.
*02:36.480- 02:39.160* :  You know, it's a difficult enough childbirth in general,
*02:39.820- 02:41.460* :  but 30,000 feet in the air.
*02:41.620- 02:44.160* :  You know, I can only imagine how stressful this must have been for her.
*02:44.500- 02:47.400* :  We meet the man who helped ensure a mother and baby
*02:47.400- 02:49.460* :  came back down to Earth safely.
*02:49.460- 02:52.700* :  I'm Dr. Hassan Khan, and I hope to live a baby on a plane.
*02:53.240- 02:54.520* :  You're listening to the happy part.
*03:00.620- 03:03.320* :  Let's begin with some music, country music.
*03:03.660- 03:08.440* :  This is Good News Sold, and it's all about how much better would all feel
*03:08.440- 03:10.900* :  if there was less doom and gloom in the news.
*03:11.380- 03:12.840* :  You can see why we like it.
*03:13.260- 03:16.600* :  It's by one of the biggest stars of country music, Jordan Davis.
*03:16.600- 03:21.380* :  He's been speaking to Adam Porter and said he liked the synergy with the happy part.
*03:21.820- 03:22.720* :  Definitely perfect fit.
*03:23.180- 03:24.980* :  That was a song that came to me a couple of years ago.
*03:25.800- 03:28.940* :  You know, really kind of when it felt like the news was nothing bad.
*03:28.940- 03:33.260* :  And unfortunately, I think we all live in a world where the bad news sells.
*03:33.680- 03:35.140* :  It's not the good stuff that's being heard.
*03:46.220- 03:51.760* :  It's almost like my wish, my hope that going forward, we start focused on the positive
*03:51.760- 03:53.360* :  and not so much on the bad.
*03:53.880- 03:55.400* :  So how did the song come to you then?
*03:55.400- 03:59.240* :  Because I know you normally have a hand in writing at your songs, but not this one.
*03:59.660- 04:01.020* :  My brother's the co-writer on it.
*04:01.180- 04:03.440* :  He wrote it and sent it to me the same day they wrote it.
*04:03.780- 04:07.360* :  And I remember thinking like, hey, man, why don't you bring this to me whenever we write?
*04:08.340- 04:11.580* :  He's like, man, I was going to, but I threw it out in the room.
*04:11.580- 04:15.280* :  He was writing with two great songwriters, Jordan Rowe and Cole Taylor.
*04:15.620- 04:20.020* :  And we just started writing and it just kind of fell out so we had to finish it.
*04:20.080- 04:24.400* :  So I was like, well, I wish I was the writer on it, but I'm going to cut it.
*04:24.760- 04:27.620* :  Now, we as journalists know that news avoidance is a big thing.
*04:27.620- 04:31.500* :  People not wanting to turn on the news because they think it's going to be really bad.
*04:31.860- 04:34.920* :  So do you think we could do more to put good news stories on?
*04:35.740- 04:36.940* :  I think we probably all could.
*04:37.280- 04:41.360* :  You know, it's not just journalists or news anchors.
*04:41.480- 04:45.300* :  I think it's even just every day, people like myself.
*04:46.000- 04:48.040* :  You know, if you see somebody that needs some help, help them out.
*04:48.180- 04:50.960* :  You know, I think that's what my favorite thing about the song is.
*04:57.280- 05:00.560* :  It's helping somebody that needs help on a flat tire.
*05:01.820- 05:03.380* :  So the gate won't end.
*05:05.420- 05:09.100* :  Share a story about a reunion with a son or a father.
*05:15.500- 05:20.200* :  It's those little things that I think are just as important as the big things.
*05:20.840- 05:22.300* :  I don't think it's necessarily on y'all.
*05:22.300- 05:23.720* :  You know, that's not fair.
*05:24.280- 05:26.160* :  I think it's on us to kind of highlight that stuff.
*05:26.160- 05:29.500* :  And me personally, I think it's somebody that has the platform,
*05:29.920- 05:31.980* :  You know, it gets a chance to stay on a stage every night.
*05:31.980- 05:34.680* :  You know, that's my chance to kind of highlight some of those things.
*05:35.460- 05:39.120* :  You kind of combat the papers or the news channels that, uh,
*05:39.680- 05:42.840* :  it's kind of maybe just trying to get clicks or, or sell some story.
*05:43.120- 05:43.880* :  It's on all of us.
*05:44.280- 05:47.600* :  I mean, to be fair to you, some of your biggest songs are really positive, aren't they?
*05:47.600- 05:49.860* :  I'm thinking next thing you know, or by dirt.
*05:54.440- 05:57.980* :  I mean, people think country music is all heartbreak and murder balance,
*05:57.980- 05:59.760* :  but it doesn't have to be that way, doesn't it?
*06:00.120- 06:02.080* :  I'm definitely guilty of having a few of those myself,
*06:02.420- 06:05.680* :  but I think what really I took a turn in my career,
*06:06.480- 06:11.340* :  as a songwriter, as an artist, was whenever I just started writing really honestly.
*06:17.300- 06:20.960* :  You know, writing about my life, my kids,
*06:22.020- 06:25.900* :  the struggles I was going through, you know, that's when I felt like I really started
*06:25.900- 06:26.640* :  connecting with people.
*06:29.980- 06:35.020* :  You know, it's fun to write as we call them in Nashville, the uptempo hits
*06:36.180- 06:42.580* :  that maybe lyrically aren't that deep, but it's more fun to write a song like
*06:42.580- 06:44.860* :  Good New Soul and see it impact and see it connect.
*06:45.560- 06:48.320* :  So I'm very grateful for the way people have been grabbing on to this one.
*06:58.000- 07:00.460* :  Jordan Davis speaking to Adam Porter.
*07:01.400- 07:07.800* :  The internet, it's a vast source of information for the more than 4.5 billion of us who use it.
*07:08.160- 07:13.040* :  Its uses are almost unlimited to social media, music streaming, podcasts,
*07:13.920- 07:19.340* :  and arguably more importantly education, but many millions of school children and students
*07:19.340- 07:24.360* :  around the world can't get online, and for them this is a crucial learning resource
*07:24.360- 07:31.160* :  that has been unavailable until now. A new system that allows children to browse millions of pages
*07:31.160- 07:36.300* :  from the internet whilst offline is being introduced in classrooms in Senegal,
*07:37.040- 07:40.320* :  where nearly half the population doesn't have access to the internet.
*07:40.960- 07:43.740* :  The BBC's Bors Hotel has been finding out more.
*07:45.000- 07:50.820* :  I've travelled to a small, three-line village in the remote far southeast of Senegal.
*07:51.460- 07:54.440* :  There's no electricity here, and no internet connectivity.
*07:57.380- 07:59.440* :  I'm here to visit the local primary school.
*08:03.600- 08:08.540* :  In front of me, the teacher, Mr. Jiao, has a large silver-lined black box
*08:09.080- 08:12.580* :  about the size of a suitcase which he puts on the desk before opening.
*08:13.240- 08:15.320* :  So, I'll have the flag as well.
*08:16.840- 08:22.240* :  In here, I've got 12 tablets, an online server, a video projector,
*08:22.240- 08:24.420* :  and a solar panel to charge the tablets.
*08:25.140- 08:29.420* :  This is the IDU's Q, a solution designed by the French NGO,
*08:29.760- 08:33.320* :  Biblioteque San Frontier, or libraries without borders,
*08:34.100- 08:37.680* :  so that students and teachers could still benefit from the wealth of information
*08:38.080- 08:40.860* :  found on the internet without having a proper connection.
*08:42.620- 08:44.940* :  In the box is a small portable server.
*08:45.560- 08:50.820* :  Anyone nearby can connect their tablet computer, phone, or laptop, and start browsing.
*08:51.500- 08:56.440* :  But unlike a normal Wi-Fi hotspot, it's only possible to access a very limited
*08:57.040- 08:58.500* :  offline version of the internet.
*09:00.280- 09:02.620* :  Essentially, the libraries without borders,
*09:02.620- 09:08.160* :  team, have decided which bits of the internet will be the most useful for primary schools
*09:08.580- 09:12.320* :  like this one, and they've downloaded all of that data in advance.
*09:14.880- 09:19.140* :  After powering up the server, Mr. Jiao hands out a tablet to each child.
*09:22.380- 09:30.360* :  In this classroom, we have 35 students, 13 boys, and 22 girls.
*09:40.100- 09:40.800* :  What are you learning?
*09:41.600- 09:43.060* :  What are your favorite subjects?
*09:43.940- 09:46.600* :  Community, life, history,
*09:47.780- 09:50.680* :  awareness of the slave trade.
*09:51.680- 09:55.940* :  They show pictures, photos of people.
*09:56.980- 09:59.620* :  I am happy to learn with the tablets.
*10:00.500- 10:02.260* :  It's fun and easy.
*10:03.860- 10:06.400* :  But teachers like Mr. Jiao, whom we met earlier,
*10:07.020- 10:11.920* :  being able to use educational resources like these without having to connect to the internet
*10:12.380- 10:13.940* :  has been a game changer.
*10:17.460- 10:21.980* :  The kids is easy to use, and it saves us time while teaching.
*10:22.680- 10:27.960* :  Using the tablets or projector not only allowed us to get through more learning,
*10:28.540- 10:30.800* :  but for the children to engage with the girls.
*10:30.800- 10:37.220* :  The videos, in particular, enable the students to grasp ideas and concept much quicker
*10:37.780- 10:39.220* :  than they would have otherwise.
*10:40.840- 10:43.620* :  Since the project started in November 2023,
*10:43.660- 10:50.660* :  ideas cute kids have been delivered to 70 schools and used by around 15,000 children
*10:51.020- 10:55.920* :  in this part of Senegal to learn everything from history, to math, and French.
*10:56.000- 10:57.540* :  The same on and on.
*11:00.720- 11:02.240* :  Borsotal in Senegal.
*11:02.520- 11:07.140* :  And for more on that story and other innovative ways of improving access to education,
*11:07.140- 11:12.600* :  including a textbook size science lab in Ghana and a night school for children in Pakistan,
*11:13.060- 11:17.600* :  listen to BBC People Fixing the World, wherever you found this podcast.
*11:18.860- 11:21.440* :  Now, have you ever heard of a Francois Langer?
*11:24.600- 11:27.980* :  Now you've heard one. They're also known as Francois leaf monkeys,
*11:27.980- 11:30.980* :  and are native to China, Laos, and Northern Vietnam.
*11:31.020- 11:33.260* :  But their numbers are dwindling.
*11:33.260- 11:39.000* :  It's believed the population has halved to just 2,000 in the past four decades due to habitat
*11:39.000- 11:45.140* :  loss and hunting. So you can imagine the excitement when a Francois Langer was born at a zoo here
*11:45.140- 11:51.100* :  in the UK. The bright orange baby is being hailed as a sign of hope for the endangered species.
*11:51.740- 11:55.340* :  I spoke to Sarah Forsyth, who's in charge of mammals at Whipsnade Zoo,
*11:55.660- 11:58.780* :  and started by asking her about that astonishing hair colour.
*11:59.960- 12:05.760* :  Yeah, it's quite odd because the adults are black with a small amount of white on their faces,
*12:05.760- 12:10.120* :  but they're predominantly black. But the babies are born like a bright orange,
*12:10.120- 12:15.160* :  so they almost look like they don't belong, possibly just so that the adults can see
*12:15.160- 12:21.660* :  them easier and can give them care easier. But that colour will gradually change to black over
*12:21.660- 12:27.060* :  the first year and then they look the same as the adults. Tell me about the characteristics of
*12:27.060- 12:31.780* :  these Francois Langers, because we've talked before about monkeys like macaques.
*12:32.000- 12:35.980* :  We talked a few weeks ago about an escaped monkey, which was a Japanese macaque.
*12:36.340- 12:42.160* :  What are Francois Langers like? I mean, like most monkeys and primates, they do have
*12:42.880- 12:49.780* :  a tendency to be a bit cheeky, and like to cause us a few challenges every now and again,
*12:49.780- 12:53.960* :  but generally Francois Langers are pretty laid back. They're not overly aggressive,
*12:54.200- 12:58.520* :  and they're very nice to each other. They create a lovely, lovely family group,
*12:58.520- 13:03.540* :  and although they like to make a lot of noise, I would say for a primate, they're actually
*13:03.880- 13:06.300* :  quite nice, quite chilled, and really pleasant to work with.
*13:06.880- 13:08.480* :  What kind of noise do they make?
*13:09.020- 13:12.380* :  So depending on what's going on at the time, if there's something not particularly happy about,
*13:12.380- 13:16.720* :  or there's seen something that worries them, whether that's another animal and another enclosure,
*13:16.760- 13:20.600* :  or something that's just going on around the exhibit, they kind of do like an alarm call,
*13:20.600- 13:22.020* :  almost like a barking noise.
*13:25.540- 13:30.600* :  So not quite like a howl among keep, but certainly not a quiet monkey either.
*13:31.120- 13:36.260* :  No, they're not quiet. So certainly Wang Elmay, who's dead, he's barking quite a lot
*13:36.260- 13:39.060* :  on the top of his enclosure, looking out, surveying his kingdom,
*13:40.860- 13:45.120* :  and just kind of telling everybody that this is his area and sort of protecting the female.
*13:45.220- 13:48.400* :  So he'll do quite a loud barking noise to let everybody know he's about.
*13:50.460- 13:56.120* :  What does this mean for the future of the species here and also in its native countries?
*13:56.660- 14:00.900* :  Well, we're part of the European breeding programme for this species.
*14:01.100- 14:06.880* :  So what we're basically trying to do is ensure we have a genetically stable and healthy
*14:07.640- 14:11.740* :  population in a captive situation so that if things do improve in the wild,
*14:11.740- 14:15.940* :  and there is an opportunity for us to be able to send individuals back to the wild,
*14:15.940- 14:18.440* :  where it's safe to do so, then we can do that.
*14:18.460- 14:23.080* :  But whilst obviously they are still facing challenges out in their range countries,
*14:23.280- 14:27.340* :  then we know we've got a really healthy stable population in our zoos.
*14:27.560- 14:32.600* :  So the more babies we can have born and healthy and we know that we're providing them
*14:32.600- 14:36.840* :  with the right diet and the right environment and that we can breed them in the carter than
*14:36.840- 14:41.240* :  properly, then we're ticking all of the boxes for ensuring that we're, you know,
*14:41.240- 14:42.860* :  conserving the species for the future.
*14:43.200- 14:48.240* :  Sarah Forsyth, and if you'd like to see this rare baby for yourself or help choose its name,
*14:48.240- 14:53.320* :  you can go to whipsnadezoo.org. Staying with Baby Animals,
*14:53.340- 14:58.940* :  vets at a wildlife centre in the US state of Virginia have devised an ingenious way of comforting
*14:58.940- 15:06.840* :  an abandoned fox cup or kit, donning fox masks when they feed or handle it. Melissa Stanley is the
*15:06.860- 15:09.420* :  founder and director of the Richmond Wildlife Centre.
*15:12.540- 15:18.760* :  We're always utilizing masks to conceal us as humans. You don't want them to think that your mom.
*15:18.960- 15:25.660* :  If we think about how a human baby or even chimpanzees and other mammals, how they're relating
*15:25.660- 15:30.840* :  with their mothers through eyesight, I think it's really important that if she would open her eyes,
*15:30.960- 15:34.680* :  I don't want the first thing for her seat is to be a person.
*15:35.500- 15:41.260* :  Such a young fox is not something that we see often at our wildlife centre and so this is
*15:41.260- 15:46.000* :  our first neonate and so I needed an emergency mask. We put a plea out in a great donor
*15:46.000- 15:52.160* :  bought the mask and we got it 24 hours later. She was admitted at 80 grams. This morning she weighed
*15:52.160- 15:59.240* :  144 grams so she's eating really well. She's doing much better now that she has a fake stuffed mom
*15:59.240- 16:06.660* :  fox to nurse on. The exciting news is that we did find some fox kits that are similar in weight
*16:06.720- 16:13.000* :  and age for her and we will be transferring her in upcoming days to get with those kits as quickly
*16:13.000- 16:19.320* :  as possible. And you can see this baby fox and Melissa in her mask just head over to the BBC
*16:19.320- 16:31.000* :  website and search fox mask. Coming up in this podcast, a pregnant stingray but how?
*16:31.520- 16:36.740* :  People have written and said well they can hold male sperm you know for years and I'm like she's never been around a male.
*16:44.600- 16:45.900* :  Take a listen to this.
*16:55.400- 17:01.200* :  This is Notes of Chai featuring Precache. One of a series of tracks that's been created at a
*17:01.200- 17:06.260* :  recording studio in Germany using the tremors of people with Parkinson's disease.
*17:15.160- 17:20.760* :  The project called Tremors versus Tremors was designed to help provide relief for people with the
*17:20.760- 17:27.080* :  condition. One Tibetan is one of the sound engineers who worked on the tracks at Dahouse in Berlin.
*17:27.720- 17:36.780* :  The role of the tremor in this song is to make each one of the instruments that it's applied to. Sound unique.
*17:41.360- 17:49.820* :  We put a lot of efforts in writing their own stories and sounding and also using the uniqueness of their
*17:58.520- 18:04.860* :  tremors. I think we created something very special and unique for each one of them and still
*18:04.860- 18:10.180* :  enjoyable for everyone that wants to listen to the tracks. More than 10 million people around the
*18:10.180- 18:15.480* :  world have Parkinson's and while tremors are perhaps the best known symptom, there are many others
*18:15.480- 18:21.780* :  like pain, stiffness and loss of balance. Dr Chris Lambert from the UCL Queen Square Institute of
*18:21.780- 18:27.600* :  Neurology in London was one of those behind the project. We approached five individuals with
*18:27.600- 18:31.940* :  Parkinson's who affected by tremor in different ways and really took their narratives and their
*18:31.940- 18:36.600* :  personal stories combined with recordings of their tremor to create the tracks. Volunteers' responses
*18:36.600- 18:41.360* :  were all quite unique. They all took very, very different things away from it. Parkinson's itself
*18:41.360- 18:45.240* :  is an extremely variable condition of how it affects one person is not how it affects another
*18:45.680- 18:49.980* :  and many other symptoms are indeed hidden from view which is part of the point of doing this project
*18:49.980- 18:54.320* :  was really to highlight that and bring attention to the hidden face of Parkinson's.
*18:57.560- 19:04.620* :  So how did the music make the people who inspired it feel? Let's hear from Coohan, Clare, John and staff.
*19:08.140- 19:17.500* :  I liked it. It was very me. I feel a physical change in my symptoms when I have an emotional
*19:17.500- 19:23.980* :  reaction to see if there's nothing more emotional than a music that's based on me.
*19:36.200- 19:45.160* :  This has given me the confidence to share that with other people and to explore, I guess, what
*19:45.160- 19:51.020* :  my Parkinson's means to me and how it affects or doesn't affect other people and just feel
*19:51.320- 19:52.760* :  more confident about it, yeah.
*20:06.180- 20:10.360* :  I can also hear the tremor in the background and in the intro and it's obviously relaxing
*20:10.360- 20:15.200* :  and it drags me into it so I can feel it.
*20:24.400- 20:29.860* :  It made me think about how strong I am really and I think I'm learning not to be
*20:30.720- 20:33.380* :  self-conscious about it. There's nothing to be ashamed of.
*20:42.720- 20:48.440* :  And you can hear all the music and find out more about this project at tremorsversetremors.com.
*20:49.440- 20:54.940* :  There are a few statements no one wants to hear went on a plane. One being is there a doctor
*20:54.940- 21:01.680* :  on board. Last weekend, a flight from Jordan to the UK had to be diverted to southern Italy after
*21:01.680- 21:06.540* :  a woman went into labour mid-flight. When cabin crew asked if there was a doctor on board,
*21:06.540- 21:12.540* :  seven stood up. Dr Hassan Khan was one of them and I spoke to him about the mile high birth.
*21:13.300- 21:18.160* :  So we all went up to see what was happening and that's when we gathered that there was a lady
*21:18.160- 21:24.040* :  who was seven months pregnant and her waters had broken so we were possibly expecting a delivery
*21:24.040- 21:29.480* :  in the air. There was an extra level of complexity here wasn't there because the woman who was
*21:29.480- 21:34.200* :  giving birth, she doesn't speak English. Yeah, absolutely. I didn't think we need any more
*21:34.200- 21:39.900* :  complicated factors but there was the big one. I did have to work through other fellow passengers
*21:39.900- 21:44.120* :  who were helping me translate so that I could sort of gather some more information and get
*21:44.420- 21:49.880* :  sort of the message across to her about why level of experience and what I think might need to be
*21:50.220- 21:54.800* :  done. As fortunate as we were to have seven doctors on board, none of us have actually had
*21:54.800- 21:59.720* :  direct experience in that work capacity in obstetrics so then the next question became
*21:59.720- 22:04.960* :  who's had experience dealing with neonates and very very young babies immediately after birth
*22:05.500- 22:10.180* :  and I was the only one so therefore the sort of responsibility fell on my shoulders to take
*22:10.180- 22:14.640* :  charge of the situation. Right, so you took the lead because of course this baby was born at seven
*22:14.640- 22:21.020* :  months, not nine. Yeah, absolutely and that was sort of the main thing that was a bit of a worry
*22:21.020- 22:26.140* :  in the initial situation because seven months of course we're two months premature so at that
*22:26.140- 22:30.420* :  point in time a number of different things are running in my mind about things we need to exclude,
*22:30.420- 22:35.980* :  things I'm hoping on a problem in the air. I think you'd agree any kind of medical emergency
*22:35.980- 22:42.520* :  on a flight in the air is scary. This must have been terrifying for this woman given the
*22:43.600- 22:49.940* :  extra complexities with not speaking English and obviously an early birth. It must have been
*22:49.940- 22:55.260* :  terrifying for her. Yeah definitely, I mean that was that was my main sort of concern. You know
*22:55.260- 23:01.760* :  it's a difficult enough childbirth in general but 30,000 feet in the air with not a wave to speak
*23:01.760- 23:07.300* :  clearly to the person or persons who are trying to look after you and also being early at seven months
*23:07.880- 23:11.600* :  you know I can only imagine how stressful this must have been for her. This situation is
*23:11.600- 23:17.680* :  exceptionally rare. There aren't many babies born on planes in the air. The information that I
*23:17.680- 23:24.180* :  had received at the time from airline staff was that there's only 74 previous births in the air
*23:24.180- 23:29.440* :  that have happened in commercial aviation history which was another thing that just shocked me
*23:29.440- 23:33.160* :  because I knew it was rare. I knew this was my usual situation. I didn't think it was that
*23:33.160- 23:38.900* :  exceptionally rare. And baby and mother how are they doing now? Have you been able to see them again
*23:38.900- 23:43.160* :  or speak to them since since you handed them over to the paramedics? Yes, I've had a couple of
*23:43.160- 23:49.160* :  updates actually about eight to ten hours after the birth late afternoon on Saturday. We got an
*23:49.160- 23:53.660* :  update from the hospital from the family but the baby and the mom were doing really well and the
*23:53.660- 23:58.360* :  baby wasn't requiring an incubator or anything along those lines at that point in time which is
*23:58.360- 24:03.180* :  really really good news. And that was a big you know sigh of relief. We got an update a few days
*24:03.180- 24:07.280* :  later after that as well again to say that the baby and mom are still doing really really well
*24:07.660- 24:11.300* :  and the doctors are happy with their progress so far which again this is really great to hear
*24:11.300- 24:18.860* :  such positive news. Doctor Hassan Khan now staying with unusual births. Let's go to North Carolina to
*24:18.860- 24:24.600* :  meet a stingray named Charlotte. She's become a bit of a celebrity because she's expecting four
*24:24.600- 24:30.000* :  pups in the coming weeks but hasn't been in a tank with a male stingray for eight years.
*24:30.860- 24:35.500* :  How she became pregnant is quite the mystery as Nikki Cardwell has been finding out.
*24:36.220- 24:43.440* :  My name is Kim Flee. She's been nicknamed the miracle of Main Street. When the Aquarium
*24:43.440- 24:48.920* :  and Shark Lab in Hendensville in North Carolina announced on social media that it was expecting
*24:48.920- 24:55.440* :  the pitter-patter or should that be splish splash of tiny fins, news of what could be a virgin birth
*24:55.440- 25:01.480* :  went viral. The footage shared on social media of celebrity mum Charlotte clearly shows her bump
*25:01.900- 25:06.160* :  and an ultrasound scan has confirmed that she was carrying a litter of heart.
*25:06.160- 25:10.460* :  We didn't see some movement already. The question is who's the daddy?
*25:11.320- 25:16.480* :  Brenda Rayma from the Aquarium told ABC News that they weren't sure at first because she had
*25:16.480- 25:20.900* :  shark bites on her body. People have written and said well they can hold male sperm you know for
*25:20.900- 25:26.260* :  years and I'm like she's never been around a male until we put those two little boys in here.
*25:26.380- 25:31.880* :  The scan has ruled out the two sharks who are Charlotte's only companions. The only other option
*25:31.880- 25:38.680* :  is Parthenogenesis, a process where cells spontaneously split inside of females' eggs and create
*25:38.680- 25:44.880* :  an embryo. We think Charlotte is her own daddy. Parthenogenesis has never been documented in captive
*25:44.880- 25:51.020* :  stingrays. Kevin Feldheim from the Field Museum in Chicago will test the pups when they're born
*25:51.020- 25:56.220* :  just to be sure. In hybrids of other species sometimes you can tell because they're morphologically
*25:56.220- 26:01.440* :  in between the two parent species. If this is in fact a shark ray hybrid we will be easily
*26:01.440- 26:06.960* :  able to tell that it is in fact a hybrid. If it's by Parthenogenesis the only way is through
*26:06.960- 26:12.020* :  the DNA testing. I would stake my reputation that it's Parthenogenesis and not hybridization
*26:12.020- 26:17.500* :  between a shark and a ray. The question now occupying social media is when will the pups be born?
*26:18.060- 26:23.700* :  Stingray gestation can vary dramatically and because the keepers don't know when conception was
*26:24.260- 26:29.680* :  no one is entirely sure when Charlotte is June. And still no babies. That was our update for today.
*26:30.660- 26:34.520* :  Nikki Cardwell and we will keep you updated when we find out more.
*26:36.020- 26:41.120* :  If you ever feel like you're having a bad day at work spare thought for the tennis player Carlos
*26:41.120- 26:48.660* :  Alcaraz. His match against Alexander Zverev was interrupted by bees. They swarmed onto the court
*26:48.660- 26:54.940* :  at Indian Wells in California and when Alcaraz tried swatting them with his racket he was stung
*26:54.940- 27:00.880* :  and run off court. When the match resumed two hours later the Spaniard showed no ill effects
*27:00.880- 27:07.940* :  winning in straight sets. I've never seen something like that so I think I will remember that
*27:07.940- 27:17.280* :  much because of that. In every body we'll remember this situation and we found it as a funny thing
*27:17.280- 27:24.240* :  that's for sure. A beekeeper was called to remove the swarm and that's almost it from us for now.
*27:24.680- 27:29.540* :  So let's end on some more of that Jordan Davis song we heard at the start which could almost
*27:29.540- 27:47.900* :  have been written about the happy part. Good news sold. Thank you to all of you who've sent
*27:47.900- 27:52.980* :  in your own rare and endangered languages. It's been a joy learning about them and the ways
*27:52.980- 27:57.920* :  you're keeping them alive and teaching others. We hope to include them in a future addition.
