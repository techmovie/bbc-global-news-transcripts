*00:22.700- 00:29.640* :  a country, entire communities, millions of lives torn apart by a devastating war, a war which

*01:14.480- 01:19.960* :  I'm Andrew Patron at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 19th of March. These are our main stories.
*01:20.540- 01:26.920* :  Hong Kong passes sweeping new security legislation. The US searches Israel to allow more aid into
*01:26.920- 01:32.760* :  Gaza and we visit San Francisco which is seeing record numbers of deaths from fentanyl drug overdoses.
*01:35.380- 01:41.660* :  Also in this podcast the memorable moments in Prince Andrew's 2019 BBC interview turn into a film
*01:41.660- 01:47.260* :  with Jillian Anderson playing the interviewer Emily Maetless. The different moments where it almost
*01:47.260- 01:55.700* :  didn't happen so why not dramatise up until one of the most important and dramatic interviews in
*02:04.360- 02:10.460* :  history and also be the most famous pair of Ruby slippers in the world going on tour ahead of
*02:16.680- 02:20.200* :  being sold at auction. Let's start in Hong Kong where a new national security bill has been passed.
*02:20.680- 02:25.380* :  Many fear it'll restrict freedom and fuel a culture of fear in the city which is ruled by China.
*02:25.420- 02:31.640* :  The package known as article 23 targets new offences like external interference and insurrection.
*02:32.140- 02:35.940* :  Hong Kong's leader John Lee hailed its passing as a historic moment for the people
*02:35.940- 02:41.740* :  and said it would be good for stability. So how did this new law come to be passed? I asked our Asia
*02:41.740- 02:47.320* :  Pacific Regional Editor Silia Hatton. Well Andrew it's important to note that this is the law
*02:47.320- 02:52.300* :  that was just passed by the legislature. It's actually a law to replace one that was already
*02:52.300- 02:59.680* :  imposed by Beijing back in 2020. That existing law was already pretty tough. 300 people have been
*02:59.680- 03:05.600* :  arrested under it. It's led to the shutting down of civil society groups disbanding newspapers
*03:05.600- 03:12.760* :  disbanding and dozens of opposition politicians and activists going abroad or heading to prison.
*03:13.220- 03:18.760* :  Now this new law Beijing basically ordered Hong Kong the authorities in Hong Kong to come up with
*03:18.760- 03:25.520* :  their own law to replace the one that Beijing had imposed. The new law that Hong Kong lawmakers have
*03:25.520- 03:32.700* :  been working around the clock to pass adds new crimes as you said for an interference insurrection.
*03:32.700- 03:38.660* :  They've also added new punishments up to life in prison. Unfortunately though critics say these
*03:38.660- 03:44.040* :  laws are quite vague and so it's easy to be prosecuted because it's really unclear where the
*03:44.040- 03:49.680* :  red lines are. Lots of reaction to the principle of the thing. What would it actually change in terms
*03:49.680- 03:55.820* :  of people's lives in Hong Kong? It's not to change things in two ways. On an individual level
*03:55.820- 04:02.080* :  people who work in certain professions are really worried because as I said the laws are quite vague
*04:02.080- 04:07.840* :  and so they're not clear whether they'll be crossing those lines at any time. Lawyers, journalists,
*04:07.840- 04:14.340* :  government workers are worried even priests. It was said during the passing of these laws that if
*04:14.340- 04:21.080* :  a priest is listening to a confession and someone tells them something that could lead to insurrection
*04:21.080- 04:26.260* :  or something that they think is actually a criticism of the Chinese Communist Party or the Hong
*04:26.260- 04:31.560* :  Kong authorities those priests could actually be breaking the law if they don't alert the authorities
*04:31.560- 04:36.480* :  of what they heard in a confession. And on a bigger level Hong Kong status as an international
*04:36.560- 04:42.200* :  city is really affected here because things like working with external forces is now considered
*04:42.200- 04:47.240* :  to be a crime and so that's really led many people to say that this will just radically change Hong
*04:47.240- 04:53.420* :  Kong and make it just like any other mainland Chinese city. Senior Hatton reporting. Next to the war
*04:53.420- 04:59.520* :  in Gaza and Israeli negotiators have been in Qatar for a new round of ceasefire talks. Qatar's
*04:59.520- 05:05.400* :  foreign ministry spokesperson says Israel's top spy chief has left Doha but the talks are continuing.
*05:05.920- 05:11.120* :  Meanwhile, there have been more US diplomatic moves to try to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
*05:11.660- 05:14.620* :  In a phone call with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*05:14.620- 05:19.840* :  President Biden said Israeli plans to continue a military push into the southern city of Rafa
*05:19.840- 05:24.900* :  where over a million people have sought refuge would be a mistake. Speaking at a news conference,
*05:24.900- 05:30.480* :  the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the entire population of Gaza has acute food
*05:30.480- 05:35.960* :  insecurity and stress that facilitating humanitarian assistance was the priority for the US.
*05:36.460- 05:41.800* :  We've seen positive actions in the last couple of weeks, including the opening of the new access
*05:41.800- 05:48.380* :  point that's allowing aid to go both north and south. But we need more, we need it to be sustained
*05:48.380- 05:53.940* :  and we need it to be a priority if we're going to effectively address the needs of people.
*05:54.420- 05:58.900* :  Anna Foster is in Jerusalem for us last. Anna, if there's any chance of a breakthrough in this
*05:58.900- 06:04.120* :  latest round of ceasefire talks. Well, these talks have been ebbing and flowing for months now.
*06:04.120- 06:09.840* :  You remember it was the end of November last year, was the last time we had any kind of ceasefire
*06:09.840- 06:15.120* :  deal. It only lasted for one week. And since then, there have been occasions where the parties have
*06:15.120- 06:20.040* :  been. I say around the table, of course, remember Israel and Hamas are never around the same table.
*06:20.040- 06:24.840* :  They don't have direct diplomatic relations. So everything is mediated through Qatar and Egypt.
*06:25.440- 06:30.200* :  But there have been times when we've been told that they are talking. You might remember there
*06:30.200- 06:35.140* :  was hope that some kind of deal could be reached before the beginning of Ramadan. We're more than
*06:35.140- 06:40.320* :  a week into Ramadan now. And you might remember those images that we saw of the US President Joe Biden
*06:40.320- 06:44.280* :  licking an ice cream saying he was confident that that would be the case. But of course, it never
*06:44.280- 06:50.560* :  came to pass. Now, the fact that the two sides are talking again is a positive thing. One thing we
*06:50.560- 06:56.320* :  are told is that nothing is likely to happen quickly. They're saying minimum two weeks to try and
*06:56.700- 07:02.500* :  thrash out any kind of deal. There are still elements that the two sides don't agree on, particularly
*07:02.500- 07:06.960* :  things like Palestinians being able to return to their homes in the northern parts of Gaza.
*07:06.960- 07:12.140* :  There are discussions still going on about how many hostages would be released in any deal,
*07:12.140- 07:17.500* :  who they would be, how many Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange. So there are still
*07:17.500- 07:24.320* :  points of difference that exist, but the suggestion is that both sides are trying to work towards
*07:24.320- 07:30.620* :  at least resolving those. I mean, looking at what's happening on the ground or what's being said,
*07:30.620- 07:35.060* :  there wouldn't appear to be much cause for optimism at the moment. Is that fair?
*07:36.080- 07:40.720* :  Well, it's fair to say that when you look at what's going on on the ground, you're right. I mean,
*07:40.720- 07:45.800* :  the situation is terrible. The humanitarian situation for civilians in Gaza is absolutely
*07:45.800- 07:51.920* :  dire at the same time as talking about a ceasefire deal. Israel is repeatedly saying that it
*07:51.960- 07:57.120* :  intends to carry out a ground offensive in Raffa, where more than half of the population are
*07:57.120- 08:02.060* :  displaced. Of course, you still have more than a hundred hostages who are being held in Gaza
*08:02.280- 08:06.920* :  and desperate families. I was talking to one of them just yesterday, desperate families who want
*08:06.920- 08:13.060* :  to see their loved ones released and want the Israeli government and others to do more to make
*08:13.060- 08:19.080* :  that happen. So it seems you're right, extraordinary, that there's so much pressure both internationally
*08:19.080- 08:25.660* :  from all directions internally as well, and that nothing seems to be moving with any kind of pace.
*08:26.240- 08:29.660* :  Anna Foster in Jerusalem. The head of the European Council,
*08:29.660- 08:35.880* :  Charles Michelle, has said EU countries must significantly invest in defense to be on a war footing.
*08:36.480- 08:41.280* :  In an opinion piece printed in publications across the continent, Mr. Michelle said Russia's
*08:41.280- 08:46.140* :  invasion of Ukraine posed the greatest security challenge since the Second World War.
*08:46.140- 08:49.280* :  That's from our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Aberhardt.
*08:49.580- 08:53.840* :  Charles Michelle's warning is stark. If Europe does not give Ukraine enough support
*08:53.840- 09:00.160* :  to stop Russia, he argues, the EU will be its next target. Moscow, he said, was continuing to try
*09:00.160- 09:06.580* :  to destabilize Moldova, the Western Balkans, the South Caucasus and parts of Africa. Mr. Michelle
*09:06.580- 09:11.780* :  accused the Kremlin of spreading blatant lies to try to convince Europeans that the war in
*09:11.780- 09:17.780* :  Ukraine didn't concern them. The EU, he stressed, had to take responsibility for its own security
*09:17.780- 09:23.760* :  and not remain at the mercy of election cycles in the US, a reference to doubts in Europe over Donald
*09:23.760- 09:29.720* :  Trump. Next to Venezuela, a country that's endured political and economic crises for almost a
*09:29.720- 09:35.640* :  decade. In July, voters there will go to the polls. On the ballot paper for sure, President Nicholas
*09:35.640- 09:41.520* :  Maduro, who was re-elected for a second term in 2018, in a vote which was widely dismissed as
*09:41.520- 09:47.020* :  neither free nor fair. But the opposition leader has been banned from taking part due to alleged
*09:47.020- 09:52.880* :  financial misconduct, which he denies. Washington has threatened to reinstate economic sanctions,
*09:52.880- 09:57.040* :  if she's barred from running, but times running out because candidates have to be registered
*09:57.040- 10:02.140* :  by next Monday. And Maria Karina Machado has been talking to the BBC World Service.
*10:02.680- 10:09.600* :  They will not take us out of the electoral path. We are going and we're fighting for free elections
*10:09.600- 10:15.400* :  and Maduro is the one who's boycotting them. And we want to transit a peaceful route
*10:15.400- 10:22.100* :  while Maduro is provoking violence. And we are proposing a serious negotiation for a transition
*10:22.100- 10:27.920* :  with guarantees and Maduro is refusing it. If you aren't allowed to run,
*10:28.340- 10:33.880* :  do you think the United States should reinstate sanctions on Venezuela's world as economy?
*10:35.300- 10:42.300* :  Well, that was part of the agreement, the regime signed with the United States, in which both
*10:42.300- 10:49.680* :  parts committed to different actions. The United States has fulfilled its agreement and what they
*10:49.680- 10:56.920* :  announced it would do. The regime has not, on the contrary, they have violated every single term
*10:56.920- 11:02.720* :  of the Barbados agreement and they had increased dramatically repression and persecution.
*11:02.780- 11:09.660* :  Even as we speak, there are four managers of my campaign in four different states of Venezuela
*11:09.660- 11:17.440* :  that disappeared by the regime forces and now are being held prisoners in a prison called
*11:17.440- 11:23.380* :  Elecone, which is the biggest torture center in Latin America. They don't let me travel around
*11:23.380- 11:31.140* :  the country by playing, they block the routes, they attack us and I believe the world should hold
*11:31.140- 11:39.100* :  accountable Maduro because the consequences of Maduro staying by force would be huge, not only for
*11:39.100- 11:45.840* :  the region because the region should prepare for the biggest migration wave which seems so far.
*11:46.040- 11:54.220* :  I'm talking about millions of Venezuela who will flee if they lose the hope of freedom and
*11:54.220- 12:02.620* :  prosperity in their homeland but also I have to insist in how the very dangerous liaisons Maduro has
*12:02.620- 12:10.900* :  with Russia and Iran are being intensifying and that would that mean for the Western democracies
*12:10.900- 12:19.000* :  if Maduro stays by force. So this is a critical moment, very delicate hours and what we do both
*12:19.000- 12:25.560* :  Venezuelans and international democratic community in the hours to come I believe will be critical
*12:25.560- 12:31.680* :  for decades. The Venezuelan opposition politician Maria Carina Machado talking to my colleague Rob
*12:31.680- 12:38.580* :  Young. Fentanyl can be up to 50 times stronger than heroin and it's extremely easy to overdose on.
*12:39.000- 12:44.880* :  Last year in the US more than 100,000 people died of an overdose with the majority being from
*12:44.880- 12:50.520* :  synthetic opioids like Fentanyl. A correspondent in San Francisco James Clayton has been speaking
*12:50.520- 12:57.700* :  to one former addict. I'm with Brian a man in his mid 30s who looks remarkably well considering
*12:57.700- 13:03.260* :  his history of substance abuse. He was homeless and on the streets of San Francisco for three years
*13:03.260- 13:11.860* :  between 2020 and 2023. Mama you want a cigarette? We're out in his old stomping ground by a street corner.
*13:12.420- 13:17.200* :  A woman is holding a metal baseball bat. A man begins to light foil with his lighter.
*13:18.040- 13:22.600* :  There's someone actually doing fentanyl right there. Oh yeah that's you're going to see that
*13:22.600- 13:29.500* :  like people don't give a ****. Brian says his addiction slowly got worse. Pills then heroin
*13:29.500- 13:35.760* :  then fentanyl. After spending time in prison for a drug charge he moved to San Francisco and began
*13:35.760- 13:43.380* :  to sleep on the streets. We walk by a man slumped over in the middle of the streets seemingly passed out.
*13:43.980- 13:48.100* :  And I always wondered like how do you why don't you go and get under cover or something and it's
*13:48.100- 13:53.380* :  because you're just exhausted. You're like just sheer exhaustion and you lay where you fall you know.
*13:54.520- 13:57.140* :  So yeah I've been there. Been there plenty of times.
*13:59.020- 14:05.320* :  It's an all-encompassing desire like it's a 24 hour day job. All you're doing is acquiring money
*14:06.020- 14:10.420* :  to make sure you still have dope because even when you run out like obviously what
*14:10.420- 14:17.220* :  rolls are looming like they're gonna they're gonna come in a matter of hours. I was a booster so
*14:17.220- 14:23.380* :  what I would do is I would go to a store and I would steal ****. To keep up his habits Brian
*14:23.380- 14:29.280* :  regularly stole items from stores and sold them on the streets for his next fix which he knew
*14:29.280- 14:34.780* :  could be his last. There was one time we were sitting on a ledge smoking dope like me and a few guys
*14:34.780- 14:41.620* :  near the drug dealer spot and there was a guy like laying down on the ground kind of watching him
*14:41.620- 14:46.060* :  but he wasn't moving but people laying on the ground sleeping all over the place in that area you
*14:46.060- 14:51.520* :  know and then somebody went over to him and he was dead by the federal building like on the
*14:51.520- 14:57.820* :  sidewalk of the federal building there was a dead body sitting for hours and that's just regular
*14:57.820- 15:05.020* :  Tuesday morning or whatever. In 2022 Brian's feet were starting to get more and more swollen
*15:05.020- 15:11.980* :  a common problem for fentanyl users he walked with a limp. I had cellulitis like which is
*15:12.640- 15:18.840* :  cellular infection in my legs due to like poor circulation. Brian did survive though and says the
*15:18.840- 15:27.080* :  experience changed him he's been clean for nearly a year now. You definitely regain or even grow
*15:27.080- 15:33.080* :  a greater appreciation for little like the small letters like the sound escape or wheels in the
*15:33.080- 15:40.740* :  concrete like I couldn't enjoy anything if it wasn't like fentanyl was the first concern. Brian
*15:40.740- 15:46.600* :  could consider himself lucky during the period that he was on the streets from November 2020 to
*15:46.600- 15:56.240* :  April 2023. 1,683 people died in San Francisco due to a drugs overdose. Most of them from synthetic
*15:56.240- 16:02.460* :  opioids like fentanyl. Our correspondent James Clayton in San Francisco and if you'd like to hear
*16:02.460- 16:07.100* :  more about how fentanyl is destroying lives in the US and in other countries like Mexico.
*16:07.660- 16:14.160* :  Search BBC the documentary fentanyl online or wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*16:16.980- 16:22.240* :  Start a cow in this edition of Global News as Gambia moves one step closer to reversing a female
*16:22.240- 16:28.160* :  genital mutilation ban we get reaction from a victim who was in parliament. Survivors were breaking
*16:28.160- 16:34.460* :  down just hearing how these men were standing there and telling us that FGM does not affect us.
*16:40.800- 16:46.520* :  Where to be a woman is the podcast celebrating the best of women's well-being. I'm Sophia Smith-Gayler
*16:46.920- 16:51.860* :  and I'm Sachi Cole and we're on a quest to find out where in the world women are living their best
*16:52.080- 16:56.560* :  lives. We're hearing from some incredible women about what their countries are getting right
*16:57.040- 17:02.380* :  and picking the best bits for our female fancy land because you can't build it if you can't imagine

*17:13.960- 17:20.320* :  I'm Elise to set with the Global Story podcast. Today we have rare access to Sudan, a country,
*17:20.720- 17:27.560* :  entire communities, millions of lives torn apart by a devastating war, a war which many Sudanese
*17:27.560- 17:33.600* :  believe the world has forgotten or is just ignoring. The Global Story brings you fresh takes and
*17:33.600- 17:39.660* :  smart perspectives from our BBC journalists around the world. Find us wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:46.660- 17:51.180* :  Hades Capital Porto Prince has been shaken by one of the most violent days in the country's
*17:51.180- 17:55.940* :  spiraling security crisis. People in one of the city's wealthier districts are said to be in
*17:55.940- 18:01.820* :  panic mode after armed gangs rampage through the streets. Mac Archer is an anthropologist in
*18:01.820- 18:07.180* :  Haiti and told us what life is like in Porto Prince at the moment. What is happening here in the
*18:07.180- 18:14.280* :  metropolitan area is not the same as what is happening outside in other departments. As far as
*18:14.280- 18:21.540* :  Porto Prince the past 24 hours has been pretty tense. We are seeing more violence in areas that we
*18:21.540- 18:27.420* :  have not seen before as different gangs are trying to push into new territories, specifically in
*18:27.500- 18:35.140* :  the Peschenville area, but outside of the metropolitan area of Porto Prince, the remaining departments
*18:35.140- 18:42.720* :  are pretty untouched. They do not have or face the same type of insecurity in the means of gangs.
*18:42.760- 18:49.740* :  They do not have the same type of group of people that are enacting a type of political unrest and
*18:49.740- 18:54.960* :  violence. Hopes for political stability in Haiti have hung on the establishment of a transitional
*18:54.960- 19:00.580* :  council. The US State Department now says the council will soon be confirmed, though the position
*19:00.580- 19:05.420* :  of the country's powerful gangs could be pivotal in its success. From Haiti, our correspondent
*19:05.420- 19:11.900* :  Will Grant. From the moment Hades unelected but Washington backed Prime Minister Adiel Andres
*19:11.900- 19:17.180* :  stood down this month, the US State Department has been vocal in its support for a seven member
*19:17.180- 19:23.580* :  transitional council. Yet even though one might normally take charge, it is hard to see how it
*19:23.580- 19:30.080* :  can govern or bring greater stability to Haiti even in the short term. For many Haitians, it feels
*19:30.080- 19:35.820* :  like the political steps being taken by outside nations, pay all into insignificance against the
*19:35.820- 19:42.780* :  scale of the security crisis and the humanitarian emergency inside Haiti. On the security side,
*19:42.780- 19:47.760* :  the capital Porto Prince was again plunged into violence when gunmen carried out a massacre in
*19:47.760- 19:53.160* :  the wealthy neighbourhood of Piet on Ville. A judge's home was also attacked in the district,
*19:53.160- 19:59.340* :  creating a deep sense of panic among many residents. The humanitarian crisis also continues to
*19:59.340- 20:04.800* :  worsen with the executive director of UNICEF, Catherine Russell, describing the situation in Haiti
*20:04.800- 20:09.540* :  as horrific and warning that many people in the country are suffering from serious hunger and
*20:09.540- 20:14.540* :  malnutrition. Desperately needed aid is still not getting in fast enough.
*20:15.420- 20:20.040* :  Now as you may have heard in the last edition of Global News, a bill seeking to decriminalise female
*20:20.040- 20:26.600* :  genital mutilation or FGM in the Gambia has passed its latest parliamentary stage. Though FGM was
*20:26.600- 20:32.360* :  outlawed in 2015, some seeking to overturn the ban, argue it violates religious freedom and is
*20:32.360- 20:37.000* :  against the country's cultural practices. The bill will now go to committees of lawmakers in
*20:37.000- 20:42.900* :  Parliament for further consideration. Survivors of FGM and other activists had hoped it would be thrown
*20:42.900- 20:47.920* :  out, including one of the survivors who was present in the Gambian Parliament on Monday, Fattu
*20:47.920- 20:53.120* :  Belde. She's a Gambian women's rights activist and campaigns to end female genital mutilation.
*20:53.120- 21:00.620* :  She gave my colleague Victoria O'Hunder her reaction. It was mixed emotions. It wasn't just about FGM.
*21:01.120- 21:07.400* :  It was sitting in the Parliament and hearing men talk about what should happen to little
*21:07.420- 21:15.920* :  girls' bodies and also men trivialising the pain of FGM. So it wasn't just about the decision
*21:15.920- 21:21.320* :  they took. It's how they just stood there, men who will never understand what it is like
*21:21.320- 21:27.660* :  to live with the consequences of FGM, where the ones who were making decisions as to what
*21:27.660- 21:34.100* :  the future of Gambian girls will look like. So what arguments then were being used by those
*21:34.100- 21:42.740* :  who support the bill? Mostly the two main arguments were that this is a religious obligation and that
*21:42.740- 21:50.100* :  it is a culture and traditional norm that we've been practising for centuries and we shouldn't
*21:50.100- 21:55.660* :  change that and girls should continue to be caught. So now it's going on to further
*21:55.660- 22:01.960* :  to our committee in Parliament with lawmakers to decide upon it. Do you expect it to eventually
*22:01.960- 22:07.820* :  succeed? Do you see the president giving it a send? There is a high chance that it would succeed.
*22:07.820- 22:13.300* :  Women's rights advocate and the FGM. We've been fighting tirelessly to make sure that the
*22:13.300- 22:20.580* :  bill does enrich to this stage. Unfortunately it has and it has been moved onto the committee stage.
*22:20.900- 22:26.060* :  So that just telling you how powerful these men are and how influential they are.
*22:26.440- 22:32.580* :  So we are still hanging there. We will continue our advocacy and we do hope that even if it passes
*22:32.580- 22:38.460* :  through the committee stage that the president will reject the bill because the Gambia is not an
*22:38.460- 22:43.300* :  island. We have signed treaties both at the international at the regional level,
*22:43.820- 22:51.020* :  CRC, the Mobutu protocol which are all treaties that hold us obliged to have these laws and
*22:51.020- 22:56.940* :  legislations to support women and girls. So it was a heated debate in Parliament yesterday during
*22:56.940- 23:02.760* :  the session. I wonder what's been the reaction from the Gambian public? It's been a mixed reaction
*23:03.100- 23:08.300* :  and for me sitting in the parliament there were survivors in there and it was to re-traumatise
*23:08.300- 23:14.460* :  and survivors were breaking down just hearing how these men were standing there and telling us
*23:14.460- 23:20.900* :  that FGM does not affect us. So it was really sad just being there and the whole parliament outside
*23:21.320- 23:25.920* :  there were people everywhere, both people who support the continuation of the practice,
*23:25.920- 23:30.780* :  but also those who are advocating against it. Fatibaldi with Victoria O'Hunder.
*23:31.060- 23:37.000* :  Two football now in Italy, the Inter Milan defender Francesco Acherbi has left the Italian squad ahead
*23:37.000- 23:42.100* :  of their games with Venezuelan and Ecuador. He was alleged to have racially abused Napoli's
*23:42.100- 23:47.140* :  Brazilian international Juan Jesus in Sunday's Serie A match, something a Cherbi has denied.
*23:47.140- 23:51.360* :  Finchenzo Crendan Dino from Naples explains what happened in the match.
*23:51.760- 23:57.180* :  Here we have, let's call it a mystery, because on Sunday evening, one judge stopped playing.
*23:57.940- 24:05.380* :  He went to referee lapina explaining Francesco Acherbi had used the N word in front of him.
*24:05.840- 24:12.020* :  He was quiet, he was calm, lapina actually heard it, but couldn't stop the game because
*24:12.060- 24:20.200* :  was not present there when Acherbi used the word. So the game went on. At the end of the match,
*24:20.640- 24:27.480* :  Juan Jesus said that this is stuff that can happen in the field. So the same one Jesus
*24:28.000- 24:34.640* :  who was the object of the word defended the other player, Francesco Acherbi, trying to save him
*24:34.700- 24:42.240* :  from a long absence from the field. But what happened? Yesterday, Francesco Acherbi was interviewed
*24:42.240- 24:49.920* :  by some journalists in the street and said, after many hours from the match, I repeat from
*24:49.920- 24:58.580* :  laughter, many hours from the match, that he didn't say anything that maybe Juan Jesus had misunderstood
*24:58.580- 25:06.540* :  and that he had not even said, I'm sorry, because after the match, Juan Jesus said that there's
*25:06.540- 25:11.680* :  no problem, he said sorry, then this is stuff that can happen, let's go on. How is it that he
*25:11.680- 25:18.080* :  has decided to leave the squad? Actually, he did not decide to leave the squad. It was something
*25:18.080- 25:26.320* :  organized with the Italian team. The Italian team is not sure if Acherbi said or not this, but
*25:26.320- 25:35.080* :  meanwhile, he prefers to keep Acherbi out of the team, to avoid other problems, to keep the team
*25:35.080- 25:42.160* :  quiet. But yesterday, the late night, Juan Jesus wrote every thing on Instagram profile. He said,
*25:42.160- 25:50.180* :  I tried to keep the thing in the field, but I have to protect myself and I have to protect my values.
*25:50.240- 25:57.420* :  So here what happened, Francesco Acherbi told me, you are just and and used again the end work.
*25:57.720- 26:06.400* :  So now we are just waiting for the work of the Italian sport justice. The judge today, we just
*26:06.400- 26:13.740* :  ask for another investigation. Vincenzo Crentandino with Isaac Fanon and Francesco Acherbi has
*26:13.740- 26:19.020* :  denied making any of the statements that he's been accused of. There was no shortage of
*26:19.020- 26:25.280* :  jaw-droppingly memorable moments in Prince Andrew's 2019 interview with the BBC program News
*26:25.280- 26:30.260* :  Night, which focused on his relationship with the late convicted Peter Farge, Jeffrey Epstein.
*26:30.260- 26:35.260* :  Now it's been turned into a Netflix film with Billy Piper as the producer Sam McAllister,
*26:35.260- 26:40.280* :  who landed the interview and Gillian Anderson playing Emily Maitliffe, the former News Night host,
*26:40.280- 26:44.600* :  who did it. They've both been talking to our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson.
*26:46.000- 26:49.520* :  And on Thursday 2pm the palace. It's News Night, the movie.
*26:50.140- 26:52.500* :  Two chairs in the middle of the four, six feet apart.
*26:53.480- 26:58.860* :  While more specifically a Netflix traumatisation of how producer Sam McAllister secured Emily
*26:58.860- 27:04.360* :  Maitliffe's 2019 interview with Prince Andrew, here's how that program began.
*27:04.820- 27:09.920* :  For nearly a decade, a member of the Royal family has been dogged by questions about his friendship
*27:09.920- 27:15.380* :  with a convicted Peter file. In Scoop, Sam McAllister is played by Billy Piper. She's so
*27:15.800- 27:20.840* :  high energy and I'm like anyone I've ever met actually and you know what she's done is so
*27:20.840- 27:26.280* :  important. With Gillian Anderson portraying Emily Maitliffe. I've never been smuggled into a palace
*27:26.280- 27:36.660* :  before. To go back to 2019 when the interview was first broadcast. I have a peculiar medical
*27:36.660- 27:44.240* :  condition which is that I don't sweat. What are your memories of that? Just a God. I couldn't believe
*27:44.240- 27:49.300* :  what I was seeing and sort of felt like I don't know if I'll ever see anything like this again.
*27:49.660- 27:55.080* :  It feels like it's a car crash and slow motion in a way and it just throws up so many questions.
*27:55.080- 28:01.460* :  Why do you need to make a dramatic version of it when the original is still there for everyone to see?
*28:01.680- 28:05.740* :  Well because this as much as anything is about the story behind you know it's about the people
*28:05.740- 28:13.580* :  behind the acquisition of the interview. Everything's changed. The FBI raiding up sees who you can't
*28:13.780- 28:19.820* :  stay silent. People don't realize what goes into these interviews you know the preparation
*28:20.660- 28:26.360* :  but also what goes wrong what can go wrong the different moments where it almost didn't happen
*28:26.360- 28:34.980* :  so why not dramatize up until one of the most important and dramatic interviews in history.
*28:35.440- 28:41.080* :  Tomorrow night in an unprecedented interview we will hear from the Duke himself. At first
*28:41.120- 28:46.780* :  Julian Anderson actually turned down the role. I originally said no as I often said yeah I did.
*28:46.900- 28:52.820* :  I mean it's just too scary to play Emily Maitliffe. Why? Well because she's still living because
*28:52.820- 28:59.160* :  she's so formidable because people know her so well and I don't I probably do have to do it
*28:59.160- 29:04.480* :  because I'm so scared of it. This isn't the only version of the story being made. Emily Maitliffe
*29:04.480- 29:10.480* :  herself is executive producer on arrival three-part Amazon series. This made it slightly awkward
*29:10.480- 29:16.100* :  when Julian Anderson bumped into her after filming at the gun. I knew her so well by that point.
*29:16.100- 29:20.780* :  I was like going in for like a really you know friendly arm. Where did you meet her?
*29:21.140- 29:27.060* :  I was at a charity event. I mean the hilarious part of it was that I had come to this event
*29:27.060- 29:33.020* :  not having prepared at all and was really disheveled and she showed up as Emily Maitliffe who looks
*29:33.020- 29:37.880* :  like a movie star. Short white skirts and tanned legs and everything and I literally look like a
*29:37.880- 29:43.800* :  great aunt. As for Prince Andrew he's played by Rufus Sule. If I do an interview the question is
*29:43.800- 29:49.600* :  why you? With three hours of makeup each day transforming him into a startlingly accurate look
*29:49.600- 29:55.900* :  alike. When I heard it was Rufus I was like really? How would that face carve from gold?
*29:56.800- 30:03.780* :  Is this going to make sense and it was unreal seeing him that first time and particularly once
*30:03.780- 30:10.600* :  you get into the interview. Oh my god yeah it's uncanny. I thought that all went very well.
*30:11.060- 30:16.240* :  Prince Andrew famously thought that the interview had been a triumph. Gillian Anderson and Billy
*30:16.240- 30:20.580* :  Piper both agree there is almost no chance he will watch this version.
*30:22.520- 30:27.220* :  I'll try to report from our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson. Finally there's no place
*30:27.220- 30:33.360* :  like home. Where would the Wizard of Oz be without Dorothy's pair of magic ruby red slippers.
*30:34.040- 30:39.660* :  One of the last surviving pairs worn by Judy Garland in the classic film is going on a world tour
*30:39.660- 30:43.040* :  before being auctioned off later this year. Here's Ella Bicknell.
*30:48.040- 30:53.680* :  Off to see the Wizard these slippers are off to see the world. As one of the most recognisable
*30:53.680- 30:58.720* :  pieces of movie memorabilia these sparkling shoes will be displayed in New York, London,
*30:58.720- 31:04.380* :  then Tokyo before they're auctioned off in December. But just like Dorothy they've had quite the
*31:16.020- 31:20.460* :  adventure already. One of four remaining pairs they first hit the headlines in 2005 when
*31:20.460- 31:25.500* :  they were stolen from a museum in Judy Garland's hometown in the US state of Minnesota.
*31:25.580- 31:32.040* :  13 years later they were recovered in an FBI sting operation. Now their owner the former actor
*31:32.040- 31:38.680* :  turned collector Michael Shaw has put them up for sale with the estimated value of around 3.5 million
*31:38.680- 31:48.420* :  dollars. And think to yourself there's no place like home. There's no place like home.
*31:48.920- 31:53.480* :  The ruby slippers were at the heart of the famous 1939 Technicolor musical.
*31:53.480- 31:58.860* :  In them Dorothy dances around the yellow brick road meets a companion scarecrow tin man
*31:58.860- 32:03.860* :  and lion. And by clicking her heels three times and saying there's no place like home
*32:03.860- 32:10.820* :  they magically transport it back to Kansas. They've become a symbol of the glittering glamour of Hollywood.
*32:16.600- 32:17.620* :  Ella Bicknell reporting.
*32:20.520- 32:24.000* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
