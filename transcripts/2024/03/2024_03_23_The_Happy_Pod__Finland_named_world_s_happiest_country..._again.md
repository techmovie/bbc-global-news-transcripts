*02:10.660- 02:16.260* :  Hello, I'm Harry Bly from Finland to Italy, where a mountain rescue team had a brush with
*02:16.260- 02:18.900* :  death, but pressed on to save a man's life.
*02:19.180- 02:26.100* :  If I have a problem, I am happy to know that there are other rescue men like me in the
*02:26.100- 02:26.520* :  mountains.
*02:27.920- 02:30.100* :  We'll hear from one of the rescuers also.
*02:31.420- 02:31.840* :  Who's there?
*02:32.360- 02:32.720* :  A fish?

*02:58.560- 03:00.980* :  What do you picture when I say Finland?
*03:00.980- 03:04.140* :  Lakes, forests, saunas?
*03:04.660- 03:09.240* :  Well, as you may have heard on the Global News Podcast, it's just been voted the world's
*03:09.420- 03:13.000* :  happiest country, again, for the seventh year in a row.
*03:13.460- 03:15.940* :  Let's be clear, it's not just the saunas.
*03:16.280- 03:21.560* :  Finland is a country with a strong welfare system and, on paper, a better work-life balance
*03:21.560- 03:24.840* :  too, with annual holidays of around four to six weeks.
*03:25.420- 03:28.260* :  A connection with nature is a priority for many too.
*03:28.920- 03:33.800* :  But let's hear from someone more qualified to tell us why Finland is so happy.
*03:34.420- 03:39.240* :  Ella Cannonin is a television presenter who was voted Finland's most positive person
*03:39.240- 03:43.020* :  in October last year, when she spoke to our producer Anna Murphy.
*03:43.720- 03:47.040* :  We've told on the happy pod previously about Finland being the happiest country.
*03:47.520- 03:48.700* :  Why do you think that is?
*03:49.320- 03:54.940* :  Finland has good social security system, good healthcare system.
*03:55.400- 03:57.380* :  We enjoy being in the nature.
*03:57.380- 04:00.920* :  We have a lot of lakes and forests.
*04:01.660- 04:04.360* :  Simple things that make us very, very happy.
*04:05.060- 04:07.120* :  Well, we asked Ella to call us again.
*04:07.180- 04:13.200* :  This time with her co-host at the Broadcaster YLE, Miko Kekeleinen, to tell us more about
*04:13.200- 04:15.660* :  why Finland is such a happy country.
*04:16.240- 04:22.740* :  There are many reasons to feel happy here in Finland and one is, of course, the beautiful
*04:22.740- 04:27.740* :  nature around us that gives us really asked Finns a lot of energy.
*04:27.740- 04:34.000* :  And we have a lot of space around us as well, which makes it easy to be alone, if one prefers
*04:34.000- 04:34.700* :  to be alone.
*04:35.540- 04:39.780* :  And then, of course, this society, as a whole, is functioning very well.
*04:39.780- 04:41.580* :  The infrastructure is strong.
*04:42.200- 04:48.660* :  So I think those are some of the basic elements for the happiness of most Finns.
*04:49.020- 04:50.300* :  Ella, what makes you happy?
*04:51.140- 04:51.520* :  Freedom.
*04:52.020- 04:56.500* :  I feel free every day and I feel happy to express myself freely every day.
*04:56.920- 05:00.840* :  So I think that is part of why I feel happy every day.
*05:01.220- 05:02.880* :  It's not just Finland that's happy.
*05:02.900- 05:07.720* :  Second place was Denmark, third place Iceland and fourth place Sweden.
*05:07.720- 05:12.180* :  So clearly, these northern European, Nordic countries are doing something right.
*05:13.360- 05:14.700* :  Yeah, we had good beer here.
*05:16.180- 05:21.100* :  And one of the reasons that Finnish people are happy is always when we get a head off
*05:21.360- 05:21.640* :  Sweden.
*05:22.320- 05:25.660* :  Always beating Sweden in anything makes us always happy.
*05:25.860- 05:26.880* :  We love Swedes.
*05:27.060- 05:30.640* :  There's a bit of rivalry with them as well.
*05:31.440- 05:37.520* :  And what's your advice for listeners day-to-day on staying happy, staying positive?
*05:38.400- 05:44.820* :  My advice is just to live day by day and to appreciate the small things in everyday life,
*05:44.880- 05:50.840* :  which could be the beautiful weather, sunshine, good food, nice chat with a friend.
*05:50.860- 05:53.600* :  Nothing really more special than that.
*05:54.220- 06:00.660* :  Yeah, my advice would be where your woolen sucks, have a cup of hot tea and hold onto
*06:00.660- 06:01.520* :  the ones that you love.
*06:02.600- 06:04.200* :  I'm going to have a cup of hot tea after this.
*06:05.520- 06:09.640* :  Are there any Finnish proverbs about happiness that you could tell us about?
*06:10.720- 06:17.120* :  Oh, there are so many proverbs that say don't try to reach more than you can.
*06:17.120- 06:20.080* :  And the total opposite, you know, Denmark.
*06:20.080- 06:24.820* :  Yeah, the Finnish say that whoever has happiness should hide one's happiness.
*06:24.820- 06:26.220* :  That's the Finnish way of thinking.
*06:26.660- 06:29.000* :  We've modest with your happiness, yeah.
*06:29.940- 06:32.100* :  So we covered this story a few days ago.
*06:32.100- 06:35.700* :  And according to one of our colleagues who spoke to the Finnish tourist board,
*06:36.280- 06:40.800* :  they are now changing that proverb to those who have happiness should share it.
*06:41.420- 06:43.780* :  So apparently that is now changing.
*06:44.320- 06:45.840* :  So what would that be in Finnish?
*06:46.520- 06:47.940* :  First of all, good luck with that.
*06:47.960- 06:48.380* :  Yeah.
*06:50.280- 06:52.840* :  But I suppose that would be something like...
*06:53.820- 06:55.280* :  Kill on, Neil. Kill on, Neil.
*06:56.100- 06:56.800* :  Said no, thank you.
*06:56.800- 06:57.660* :  Give us all.
*06:57.700- 06:58.920* :  So...
*07:00.380- 07:02.400* :  Right, so which do you think is better of the two?
*07:03.540- 07:04.860* :  Are you going to hide it or flaunt it?
*07:05.740- 07:06.300* :  Yeah, flaunt it.
*07:06.380- 07:07.120* :  The new one.
*07:07.160- 07:09.320* :  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
*07:10.480- 07:11.220* :  flaunt your happiness.
*07:13.700- 07:15.960* :  Ella Kanonen and Mikko Kekalainen,
*07:15.960- 07:18.480* :  hosts of the TV show Poorly Saitsummon.
*07:18.520- 07:22.100* :  That means half past six on the Finnish broadcaster YLE.
*07:22.860- 07:25.720* :  And if you think your country has the edge when it comes to happiness,
*07:26.160- 07:28.120* :  please do get in touch, spread the joy,
*07:28.480- 07:29.940* :  details at the end of the podcast.
*07:30.740- 07:33.740* :  Now to Italy and an extraordinary rescue mission.
*07:33.900- 07:37.420* :  On Monday, a helicopter responding to an emergency in the mountains
*07:37.420- 07:40.680* :  on the Swiss Italian border crashed on a glacier
*07:41.040- 07:43.500* :  four and a half thousand meters above sea level.
*07:43.980- 07:48.660* :  Miraculously, no one was injured and the rescue team chose to continue their mission,
*07:48.660- 07:51.780* :  saving a mountaineer who'd become stuck in a crevasse.
*07:52.260- 07:55.720* :  One of the team, Paolo Pettinaroli, spoke to Jeanette Gillil,
*07:55.900- 07:57.840* :  starting with the moment of the crash.
*07:58.420- 08:01.680* :  Yes, it's a very comfortable flight.
*08:02.340- 08:07.620* :  We are very relaxed because the mission is quite easy.
*08:07.980- 08:11.960* :  And in one moment, very close to the target zone,
*08:12.820- 08:14.480* :  the helicopter, I don't know why,
*08:14.480- 08:19.800* :  lose the stability and start to turn very, very quickly.
*08:20.240- 08:24.060* :  And we crash in three, four seconds, I think.
*08:24.460- 08:26.440* :  And what was going through your mind when that happened?
*08:28.160- 08:31.180* :  So it's not easy to explain.
*08:31.180- 08:35.960* :  But you know, the only way to survive in this situation
*08:35.960- 08:40.900* :  is to have a very hard reaction in terms of thinking.
*08:40.900- 08:42.100* :  What can I do?
*08:42.500- 08:49.940* :  So I catch my chair and I try to be completely one body.
*08:51.140- 08:56.840* :  And think in advance to what I have to do when the helicopter crash.
*08:57.140- 09:01.740* :  I think all of this thing, and you know, two, three seconds and it's finished.
*09:02.300- 09:06.540* :  And after the crash, I check the other member of the group.
*09:07.140- 09:10.140* :  Everybody is still alive and talk with me.
*09:10.620- 09:12.120* :  And so, okay, we are alive.
*09:12.120- 09:14.860* :  Now we have to escape very, very quickly.
*09:15.840- 09:18.560* :  You must have been so relieved at that moment.
*09:19.080- 09:20.880* :  Really happy of a joy.
*09:20.880- 09:25.820* :  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, very happy, full of adrenaline.
*09:25.820- 09:32.200* :  So it's not easy to put in the car of the way you're thinking, your soul also.
*09:33.420- 09:37.700* :  But one time that we know that nothing happened,
*09:38.460- 09:44.320* :  as we decide to try to recover the person in the crevas.
*09:44.700- 09:47.700* :  So we go down in the glacier and we find this person.
*09:48.260- 09:51.240* :  It's not so deep in the crevas, around three meters,
*09:51.240- 09:55.160* :  but it's impossible for him to go out by himself.
*09:55.660- 10:00.260* :  And there is a very easy technique to recover with the rope.
*10:00.820- 10:02.980* :  It's a kind of pull-up.
*10:03.440- 10:09.100* :  And one time that the person go out, he told me it's able to go down in the valley by himself
*10:09.100- 10:10.800* :  with the friend.
*10:11.280- 10:14.020* :  So we decide to leave him to go down by himself.
*10:14.560- 10:18.660* :  And we back to the helicopter and recover pilot and ice operator
*10:18.660- 10:22.360* :  and waiting for another helicopter who rescue has.
*10:22.740- 10:24.000* :  And how are you all doing now?
*10:24.440- 10:26.160* :  Fortunately, I'm not injured.
*10:26.920- 10:30.480* :  So today I returned back climbing.
*10:31.060- 10:35.640* :  And tomorrow morning I will be in a rescue team operation,
*10:35.680- 10:38.200* :  is a training with helicopter again.
*10:38.200- 10:41.340* :  So my life starts again in the same way.
*10:41.980- 10:45.600* :  Given all the risks, why do you carry out mountain rescues?
*10:47.400- 10:53.620* :  So I start more than 25 years ago because I'm a mountaineer.
*10:54.640- 11:00.420* :  So I think that it's a good idea because I got experience,
*11:01.240- 11:04.120* :  become a rescuer and to help the other.
*11:04.600- 11:07.120* :  And one time I think that if I have a problem,
*11:07.140- 11:14.060* :  I am happy that to know that there are other rescue men like me in the mountains.
*11:14.780- 11:18.300* :  It's a kind of help the same person like me.
*11:18.720- 11:21.060* :  Yeah, a network where everyone helps each other.
*11:21.640- 11:24.120* :  And I think I will be again a rescuer man.
*11:25.660- 11:25.840* :  Yes.
*11:26.660- 11:29.720* :  Italian mountain rescue worker Paolo Petinaroli.
*11:30.500- 11:34.340* :  To a different type of rescue and recovery, this time in Tanzania,
*11:34.340- 11:37.860* :  the government there provides what it calls sober houses,
*11:38.220- 11:41.120* :  places where people can get help to beat their addictions,
*11:41.120- 11:44.760* :  including by putting their minds to outdoor pursuits.
*11:45.160- 11:49.120* :  Rachel Wright reports from the northern Tanzanian city of Arucia.
*11:52.820- 11:55.000* :  It's about a couple of miles outside of Arucia.
*11:55.020- 12:02.340* :  I've come to this huge cornfield where the corn crops are towering maybe 10 feet high.
*12:03.440- 12:06.580* :  And there are all these young men who are working here.
*12:06.840- 12:11.340* :  And the difference about these young men is they're all recovering drug addicts.
*12:12.580- 12:15.400* :  I asked the men if any of them spoke English and if they did,
*12:15.800- 12:19.080* :  if they'd like to tell me their story, Peter volunteered.
*12:19.820- 12:21.640* :  My mother passed away when I was four years old.
*12:22.140- 12:25.640* :  My father remarried and my stepmother wasn't really too kind to me.
*12:25.800- 12:29.360* :  In high school, it's outside smoking series, kind of class drinking,
*12:29.360- 12:34.300* :  smoking, and drugs I got into was first party drugs like ecstasy.
*12:34.620- 12:36.960* :  And I tried heroin and I got hooked on heroin.
*12:37.480- 12:39.520* :  And heroin is what got me hitting rock bottom.
*12:40.080- 12:41.820* :  And that's when I decided I need some help.
*12:41.880- 12:45.020* :  I lost pretty much all I had valued in my life.
*12:45.560- 12:47.540* :  So what happened? What turned your life around?
*12:48.700- 12:52.540* :  It was an intervention with my uncle and my father this day.
*12:52.640- 12:53.820* :  You need some help.
*12:54.160- 12:55.680* :  You need some to seek professional help.
*12:56.140- 12:57.860* :  Okay, so what is the sober house, Peter?
*12:58.500- 13:02.220* :  You are pretty much stay locked up until you detox.
*13:02.940- 13:04.820* :  Pretty tough, though, to lock you up.
*13:05.320- 13:06.040* :  Yeah. Did it work?
*13:06.900- 13:08.460* :  It worked. It was hard at first.
*13:08.460- 13:11.320* :  I was like really struggled with that, rebelled.
*13:11.760- 13:14.900* :  But after a while, it worked, gain to know about the program.
*13:15.420- 13:19.080* :  So it's being able to forgive myself and balance my emotions,
*13:19.120- 13:19.960* :  deal with my emotions.
*13:21.140- 13:25.300* :  And so now you're working in this maize field and this beautiful area.
*13:25.620- 13:27.020* :  Is this part of your treatment?
*13:28.140- 13:32.640* :  It's like after care, we are taught to be able to get responsible
*13:33.440- 13:35.780* :  and being able to put ourselves to work,
*13:36.220- 13:37.920* :  doing something positive worthwhile.
*13:37.920- 13:41.780* :  We help a lot of like people who are also like in the sober houses.
*13:42.360- 13:43.760* :  So they get food from this.
*13:44.120- 13:45.800* :  So it's like giving back for me service.
*13:46.240- 13:47.280* :  So it's servicing gratitude.
*13:48.200- 13:49.580* :  And do you feel better?
*13:49.580- 13:50.640* :  You look very happy.
*13:50.640- 13:51.360* :  You're smiling.
*13:51.920- 13:53.020* :  Do you feel happy now?
*13:53.320- 13:54.160* :  Yeah, I feel fantastic.
*13:54.260- 13:55.660* :  Thanks for asking.
*13:55.860- 13:56.420* :  I feel great.
*13:56.760- 14:01.060* :  I'm adjusting, getting back to reconciled my family and the society.
*14:01.060- 14:04.880* :  I kind of actually feel like I've been doing something that's actually valuable.
*14:06.260- 14:08.420* :  Peter ending that report by Rachel Wright.
*14:09.200- 14:12.720* :  In this podcast, we've showcased several incredible musicians,
*14:12.720- 14:17.040* :  playing instruments like piano, guitar, fiddle, even the backpipes.
*14:17.520- 14:19.860* :  But if you fancy something a little more unusual,
*14:20.600- 14:22.460* :  you might be interested in the concert.
*14:25.700- 14:28.200* :  In the U.S. State of Florida,
*14:33.180- 14:37.960* :  Key West's annual Conshell Blowing Contest or Consh Honk,
*14:38.200- 14:39.080* :  as the locals call it,
*14:39.340- 14:42.200* :  celebrates this rather different kind of musical heritage.
*14:42.860- 14:43.960* :  Ella Bicknell has more.
*15:00.620- 15:04.500* :  If you couldn't tell, that was a cover of Elton John's Crocodile Rock,
*15:04.500- 15:08.360* :  followed by, let's say, a valiant attempt at amazing grace.
*15:08.860- 15:12.480* :  Contestants of all ages wielded Conshells with various sizes,
*15:12.780- 15:14.920* :  cutting out whatever tune it came to mind.
*15:14.920- 15:17.160* :  Judges weren't just looking for volume,
*15:17.640- 15:22.040* :  but for the quality, duration and sheer novelty of the sounds produced by these
*15:22.320- 15:23.720* :  unconventional instruments.
*15:30.580- 15:32.700* :  This year, the men's division saw a tie,
*15:32.700- 15:35.400* :  Brian Cardis, a cardiologist from Georgia,
*15:35.820- 15:38.580* :  and Peter Drake, a mental health counselor from Connecticut.
*15:39.280- 15:41.780* :  Peter became a conscientious as a teenager.
*15:42.300- 15:43.140* :  He's now a true,
*15:43.140- 15:44.400* :  conch-blowing veteran.
*15:44.840- 15:46.640* :  I would give the advice of Start Slowly,
*15:46.640- 15:49.580* :  learn that bass note that the Conshell has within it,
*15:49.580- 15:52.140* :  and just play it nice and clear as clear as they can.
*15:52.400- 15:57.440* :  I tried to pick a song that was fun and a crowd pleaser,
*15:58.060- 16:02.240* :  and one that would fall in line with the limited amount of notes
*16:02.240- 16:03.720* :  that you can play on the Conshell.
*16:11.240- 16:15.140* :  However, Conch-Honk is not only just a bit of fun competition.
*16:15.140- 16:19.140* :  In the Florida Keys, the shells hold a deep historic significance.
*16:19.140- 16:23.040* :  For centuries, sailors, fishermen and islanders have relied on them
*16:23.040- 16:25.180* :  as a vital tool of communication.
*16:25.840- 16:27.680* :  Locals proudly call themselves conscious,
*16:28.180- 16:31.080* :  and Key West is unofficially known as the Contra Public,
*16:31.700- 16:34.480* :  a playful nod to the island's independent spirit.
*16:39.800- 16:41.620* :  Our Conch-Honk reporter, Ella Bicknell.
*16:45.220- 16:45.240* :  Music
*16:46.960- 16:50.200* :  Stay with us, we've got another story about musical instruments.
*16:50.200- 16:53.380* :  This one a little less abstract, and...
*16:53.380- 16:56.920* :  We know it helps because otherwise they were waiting there for weeks.
*16:57.380- 16:59.240* :  Will you help answer the fish doorbell?
*17:05.680- 17:09.740* :  Where to be a woman is the podcast celebrating the best of women's well-being?

*18:47.020- 18:48.320* :  in the episode before last.
*18:48.320- 18:52.020* :  You may remember 72-year-old Anne Hughes from South Wales
*18:52.020- 18:56.240* :  who went viral online after getting caught on a shopfront shutter,
*18:56.580- 18:58.200* :  which then hoisted her into the air.
*18:58.480- 19:01.540* :  Well, her ordeal has now been immortalised in a mural
*19:01.980- 19:03.300* :  on the shop's shutters.
*19:04.140- 19:07.340* :  In the US, scientists have identified a new prehistoric creature
*19:07.800- 19:09.240* :  related to modern-day frogs,
*19:09.740- 19:12.680* :  and they've named it after a very famous Muppets character,
*19:13.100- 19:13.560* :  Kermit.
*19:13.920- 19:17.980* :  The proto-anthibian thought to have lived 270 million years ago
*19:18.380- 19:20.600* :  is now called Kermitops gratis.
*19:21.420- 19:23.720* :  And what's black and white and red all over?
*19:23.960- 19:24.600* :  It's not a joke.
*19:24.600- 19:27.160* :  It's a new type of beetle discovered in Australia,
*19:27.160- 19:30.680* :  an insect research student spotted the fluffy specimen
*19:31.140- 19:32.820* :  during a camping trip in Queensland
*19:33.320- 19:35.840* :  and initially mistook it for bird droppings.
*19:36.840- 19:40.080* :  And now, rowing across the Atlantic is something most of us
*19:40.080- 19:42.340* :  would struggle to do at any age.
*19:42.980- 19:45.840* :  Frank Rothwell is 73 years old and he's achieved
*19:45.840- 19:49.260* :  that remarkable crossing of nearly 5,000 kilometres
*19:49.740- 19:51.800* :  on his own for the second time.
*19:51.800- 19:55.100* :  He broke his own Guinness World Record as the oldest person
*19:55.100- 19:56.480* :  to row across the Atlantic
*19:57.040- 20:00.380* :  and became the oldest person to row any ocean solo.
*20:00.980- 20:02.580* :  During his time at sea, Frank,
*20:02.580- 20:05.100* :  who's also the chairman of the British Football Club
*20:05.100- 20:08.300* :  Older Mathletic, capsized five times.
*20:08.960- 20:11.780* :  He's been speaking to our sports presenter, Gary Richardson.
*20:12.600- 20:16.020* :  I was at sea for nine weeks and in that time
*20:16.020- 20:17.680* :  I didn't even see an aeroplane.
*20:17.740- 20:19.740* :  I saw three ships that passed in the night
*20:19.740- 20:22.860* :  and apart from that, there was no other human contact.
*20:23.500- 20:26.840* :  I fought my wife every day but apart from that, that was it.
*20:27.020- 20:28.200* :  Was it dangerous at all?
*20:28.500- 20:30.900* :  There's always a danger if you're at sea by yourself
*20:30.900- 20:31.700* :  in a little ball.
*20:32.100- 20:35.760* :  The first set set of big waves was somewhere near New Year's day
*20:35.760- 20:39.500* :  when while I was sleeping, the ball got rolled over
*20:40.040- 20:43.380* :  and everything in the ball got mixed up and wet
*20:43.780- 20:45.040* :  but expected to get rolled over.
*20:45.040- 20:47.000* :  But it's never happened before.
*20:47.800- 20:48.900* :  I wanted to correct it itself.
*20:48.900- 20:51.020* :  I started to tidy up the balls and I thought
*20:51.460- 20:52.680* :  I was feeling a bit sorry for myself.
*20:53.000- 20:55.540* :  So I formed my wife up to tell the situation
*20:55.540- 20:58.320* :  and sort of a bit of comfort really.
*20:58.900- 21:00.820* :  And so I decided to have a day off rowing.
*21:01.320- 21:03.340* :  So while I was out on the deck,
*21:03.680- 21:05.200* :  a big wave came on the side of the ball
*21:05.200- 21:06.140* :  and watched me overboard.
*21:06.960- 21:09.180* :  I'm in the sea, lost me glasses, lost me at.
*21:09.800- 21:12.580* :  Most importantly, I've lost something called an e-pro
*21:12.580- 21:14.400* :  which is an emergency beacon.
*21:15.020- 21:17.320* :  When the boat capsized, that must have been very frightening.
*21:18.200- 21:19.300* :  It happened so quick.
*21:19.820- 21:21.140* :  It wasn't frightening at the time.
*21:21.140- 21:23.560* :  It's like when you've climbed back on the ball,
*21:23.560- 21:24.600* :  you then start to think,
*21:24.720- 21:26.020* :  whoa, what could have happened to you?
*21:26.340- 21:28.880* :  Rowing for nine weeks must have been exhausting
*21:28.920- 21:30.800* :  because you're 73 years old.
*21:31.080- 21:32.160* :  Well, yes, you're right.
*21:32.420- 21:34.840* :  When you're rowing, you want to row all day
*21:35.080- 21:37.300* :  and then you want to sleep and then you've got to go again the next day.
*21:37.720- 21:39.840* :  So you don't put racing speed into it.
*21:40.140- 21:41.920* :  You put the amount of effort into it
*21:41.920- 21:43.780* :  that you would be happy to walk out.
*21:44.100- 21:47.360* :  Would you ever take on a rowing challenge like this again, Frank?
*21:47.660- 21:49.900* :  Well, I promised my wife I wouldn't know.
*21:51.560- 21:53.240* :  But it's all like she'll hear this song.
*21:53.240- 21:56.420* :  Yeah, I really fancy it again, unfortunately.
*21:56.980- 21:59.200* :  But I wouldn't do it as a solo again.
*21:59.200- 22:00.500* :  I would have to do it in a pairs.
*22:01.400- 22:04.580* :  73-year-old transatlantic rower, Frank Rothwell.
*22:05.300- 22:07.020* :  We heard about conch shells earlier,
*22:07.240- 22:10.020* :  but this story is about a more traditional instrument.
*22:20.820- 22:23.620* :  This is the Il Canone violin.
*22:25.720- 22:30.080* :  It's 280 years old and one of the world's most valuable violins.
*22:32.720- 22:34.080* :  It wants belonged to the celebrated 18th century Italian composer,
*22:34.200- 22:35.260* :  Nicolò Pagginini.
*22:38.660- 22:40.160* :  Now experts are attempting to discover the secret of its magical sound
*22:42.640- 22:44.120* :  by taking detailed x-rays as Chantal Hartle explains.
*22:46.920- 22:48.160* :  To the untrained eye, this may seem like an ordinary violin,
*22:50.320- 22:50.980* :  but it's the sound that it produces that sets it apart
*22:53.600- 22:56.140* :  with Pagginini himself naming it the canon because of its power and projection.
*22:56.140- 22:58.280* :  Over the years, only a handful of international musicians
*22:58.940- 23:02.040* :  have had the chance to play the famous violin.
*23:04.220- 23:06.200* :  In his will, Pagginini gifted the instrument to his home city of Genoa
*23:09.060- 23:10.140* :  and it rarely leaves the town hall where it's displayed.
*23:12.340- 23:13.160* :  It's currently on loan to the French city of Grenoble,
*23:15.440- 23:16.120* :  where scientists at a top cultural heritage
*23:16.120- 23:20.100* :  repair workshop are scanning the violin in meticulous detail
*23:21.880- 23:23.940* :  to understand why it plays such beautiful music.
*23:25.320- 23:28.160* :  The idea is to create a 3D model so people can zoom down to a micron
*23:29.480- 23:30.040* :  or a millionth of a meter.
*23:32.440- 23:34.180* :  Scientists Paul Tafra says so far their work has shown the violin
*23:34.320- 23:38.060* :  is in good condition considering its age.
*23:39.240- 23:40.080* :  When we go to 4,000 or 2,000,
*23:41.380- 23:42.100* :  there we absolutely have all the cellululas.
*23:43.660- 23:46.080* :  When you go down to 4 microns or 2 microns,
*23:47.540- 23:50.040* :  you can see every cell in the wood.
*23:50.940- 23:55.580* :  And if there's even a microcrack, you can see all the details.
*23:55.580- 24:01.560* :  We scanned it at 30 microns to make a map of any defects.
*24:02.700- 24:04.020* :  We found very few.
*24:04.660- 24:07.780* :  The team said the logistics of transporting the violin safely
*24:07.780- 24:10.040* :  from Italy to France was a big challenge.
*24:10.040- 24:14.080* :  It was ensured for a value of $32 million for the journey.
*24:15.400- 24:18.060* :  Bruce Carlson is tasked with preserving the violin in Genoa.
*24:19.040- 24:20.040* :  Paganini himself said,
*24:20.860- 24:23.740* :  I leave my violin to the city of Genoa
*24:24.360- 24:26.040* :  that it be perpetually preserved.
*24:27.020- 24:30.060* :  And so now we are better able to understand the instrument
*24:30.940- 24:33.360* :  and better able to conserve the instrument.
*24:34.160- 24:38.040* :  The process of analysing the X-rays is expected to take several months.
*24:41.960- 24:42.940* :  Chantal Hartle reporting.
*24:49.580- 24:52.060* :  Finally, we need your help or rather some fish do.
*24:53.060- 24:56.060* :  Every spring, fish swim right through you trekked in the Netherlands
*24:56.920- 24:58.080* :  looking for a place to spawn and reproduce.
*24:59.500- 25:00.080* :  But many encounter a problem.
*25:01.620- 25:02.080* :  There's a lock for boats.
*25:02.080- 25:03.520* :  And as there aren't many boats around,
*25:03.680- 25:06.060* :  the lock gates rarely open.
*25:07.440- 25:09.740* :  Meaning the fish are unable to swim upstream.
*25:10.440- 25:12.060* :  Ecologists have come up with an innovative solution.
*25:13.460- 25:13.980* :  A doorbell.
*25:14.460- 25:15.400* :  A fish doorbell.
*25:15.960- 25:17.880* :  And as fish breeding season begins,
*25:17.880- 25:21.040* :  the doorbell has been getting its first visitors of the year.
*25:21.660- 25:23.300* :  Two of its creators, on an edge,
*25:23.540- 25:24.840* :  from Utrecht Municipality
*25:25.220- 25:27.940* :  and ecologist Mark van Hookelem, told us more.
*25:28.580- 25:32.040* :  The fish they want to travel upstream from the river Fecht
*25:32.040- 25:35.280* :  all the way to the river Chromerein.
*25:35.740- 25:38.640* :  And then they have to pass the canal system of Utrecht.
*25:39.220- 25:40.760* :  But there is a boat lock.
*25:41.140- 25:43.160* :  And that's where they got in trouble.
*25:43.240- 25:44.660* :  Because they want to travel upstream,
*25:45.060- 25:48.920* :  but they can't because the boat lock is close during springtime.
*25:49.600- 25:52.140* :  And Anna, take us through how this doorbell works.
*25:52.320- 25:55.400* :  I think the main thing is that fish can't ring doorbells
*25:55.400- 25:56.480* :  because they don't have any hands.
*25:57.060- 25:59.300* :  There's a camera in the water.
*25:59.300- 26:02.980* :  And it's the place where there's a little water going through.
*26:03.360- 26:04.880* :  So the fish, they feel it.
*26:05.200- 26:07.340* :  And they want to swim against the stream.
*26:07.340- 26:09.120* :  So they go exactly there.
*26:09.680- 26:11.980* :  And they come in front of the camera.
*26:12.520- 26:16.860* :  So everybody can look and can see if there is any fish waiting.
*26:17.580- 26:20.320* :  And when they see fish, there is a doorbell.
*26:20.980- 26:23.640* :  And then the lock keeper, he gets a sign.
*26:23.800- 26:25.720* :  He can look if there's really fish waiting.
*26:25.720- 26:28.520* :  And if there is a lot of fish or if there is some fish,
*26:28.800- 26:29.840* :  he can open the lock.
*26:30.060- 26:30.880* :  It's very sweet.
*26:30.880- 26:32.700* :  Because I've seen some of the pictures.
*26:32.700- 26:35.620* :  And you just see these fish faces,
*26:35.620- 26:38.800* :  sort of just patiently waiting by the door.
*26:38.800- 26:41.360* :  You've had quite a reaction online, haven't you?
*26:41.560- 26:42.480* :  I was on there the other day.
*26:42.480- 26:46.440* :  And you had 900 people watching the live stream waiting for fish.
*26:47.180- 26:48.900* :  That's quite a lot of users.
*26:49.680- 26:51.020* :  Oh, it's truly amazing.
*26:51.140- 26:53.480* :  We never expected this to happen at the first place.
*26:54.260- 26:56.840* :  We just started the project.
*26:56.980- 27:00.300* :  And we went door by door, people living just outside the lock,
*27:00.980- 27:04.800* :  with notes asking them to join the fish doorbell
*27:04.800- 27:08.600* :  and to help out, hoping that there would be maybe 10 or 100 people
*27:08.600- 27:09.860* :  maybe helping us out.
*27:10.060- 27:12.040* :  And as not only the creators of the fish doorbell,
*27:12.060- 27:14.000* :  but as doorbell watches,
*27:14.000- 27:16.780* :  what's the best thing you've seen on the live stream?
*27:17.200- 27:21.760* :  Well, I was really amazed by seeing the European eels several times.
*27:22.520- 27:23.980* :  It's an endangered species now.
*27:24.400- 27:28.900* :  So it's very special to see those fish pass the doorbell.
*27:28.900- 27:32.460* :  But I also are always impressed about this beautiful pike
*27:32.460- 27:35.500* :  with big bellies full with fish eggs.
*27:35.560- 27:38.120* :  Clearly, this project has been really successful.
*27:38.120- 27:39.820* :  Then you're seeing a lot of biodiversity.
*27:40.140- 27:42.560* :  And importantly, has it worked?
*27:42.560- 27:45.500* :  Has this improved the migration of fish
*27:45.500- 27:47.020* :  and allowed them to reproduce?
*27:47.660- 27:48.580* :  And we know it helps.
*27:48.580- 27:51.680* :  Because otherwise, they were waiting there for weeks.
*27:51.680- 27:54.280* :  We can also do monitoring by this.
*27:54.440- 27:59.900* :  So we know what kind of species swim at what time
*27:59.900- 28:02.540* :  it's really interesting to know more about it.
*28:02.720- 28:04.960* :  And Mark, what is next for the fish doorbell?
*28:05.000- 28:06.660* :  Do you have plans to expand it?
*28:07.780- 28:08.560* :  There's a good question.
*28:08.560- 28:12.640* :  I think we ask this question every year on what's next.
*28:13.920- 28:15.820* :  For now, we're just really enjoying the fact
*28:15.820- 28:18.040* :  that there's so much help from all the world.
*28:18.040- 28:20.620* :  And I think that really gives us energy
*28:20.620- 28:22.900* :  to do more of these type of projects.
*28:22.900- 28:25.880* :  Once you start to know what's living under the water,
*28:25.880- 28:27.380* :  you start to take more care of it.
*28:28.000- 28:29.180* :  And that's what we see right now.
*28:29.980- 28:33.840* :  Within the city of Utrecht, more and more people are proud
*28:34.100- 28:37.040* :  and interested by what's living under the water surface.
*28:37.760- 28:39.940* :  Many of those people didn't even realize
*28:39.940- 28:42.680* :  or know that they're actually fish living in the city.
*28:43.040- 28:44.420* :  It was really a surprise for them.
*28:44.780- 28:47.340* :  And I think that's something we want to explore more.
*28:47.960- 28:49.640* :  How can we involve the general public
*28:50.260- 28:52.000* :  and also create more awareness,
*28:52.360- 28:54.700* :  but also more urgency to make a change
*28:54.700- 28:56.180* :  for biodiversity on the water?
*28:56.560- 28:58.340* :  I think exactly what you just said, Mark.
*28:58.500- 29:00.900* :  People really enjoy being a part of this project.
*29:00.900- 29:03.380* :  From not just Utrecht, but around the world, it seems.
*29:03.800- 29:05.280* :  That's the most wonderful thing.
*29:05.840- 29:08.260* :  We get so nice messages of people being amazed
*29:08.300- 29:09.720* :  that they can help out.
*29:10.240- 29:12.500* :  Some people even said this is what internet is for.
*29:12.500- 29:15.200* :  We work to really make a change with each other.
*29:15.840- 29:18.660* :  Well, that feels very big for us, a small project.
*29:19.320- 29:22.260* :  But apparently, it does create some sort of difference.
*29:22.400- 29:24.640* :  And that's just beautiful to be part of.
*29:25.080- 29:27.040* :  And especially when it has such a big effect
*29:27.040- 29:28.680* :  on our natural environment as well.
*29:29.600- 29:32.960* :  Fish doorbell creators, Mark van Hoeklem and Ononezh.
*29:33.400- 29:35.040* :  And they say they've received some lovely messages
*29:35.040- 29:36.880* :  from people all over the world
*29:37.300- 29:40.040* :  about how much they enjoy using the fish doorbell
*29:40.380- 29:41.780* :  and answering the fish's calls.
*29:42.420- 29:44.260* :  Here's Tam from Sydney in Australia.
*29:44.940- 29:46.740* :  I was washing dishes and then when I finished,
*29:46.740- 29:49.760* :  I just walked back to my phone just to have a look.
*29:50.400- 29:53.800* :  And there was a fish's face just waiting at the camera.
*29:54.360- 29:57.320* :  So I clicked on the doorbell and I think it did ring.
*29:58.020- 29:58.960* :  I thought it was very fun.
*29:59.120- 30:01.000* :  And it's a really nice initiative
*30:01.040- 30:02.600* :  and a way to bring people together.
*30:03.400- 30:06.040* :  And I just thought maybe I should just leave you a voice note
*30:06.040- 30:06.960* :  just to tell you.
*30:07.280- 30:07.700* :  Thanks, Tam.
*30:07.860- 30:09.040* :  And if you'd like to answer the door too,
*30:09.040- 30:11.620* :  just search online for Fish Doorbell.
*30:11.840- 30:14.140* :  Give it a go and let us know what you think.
*30:19.080- 30:20.980* :  And that's all from us for now.
