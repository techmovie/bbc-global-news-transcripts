*02:20.980- 02:24.920* :  A state of emergency has been declared in Haiti after a deadly weekend

*02:48.080- 02:48.860* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:49.500- 02:52.800* :  It's scary that it can be created, it's scary that somebody can push it out
*02:53.100- 02:56.600* :  and then from there it's viral and it just takes on a life and a truth of its own.
*02:57.240- 03:03.980* :  We hear about the fake AI images being used to falsely portray Black people supporting Donald Trump.
*03:08.200- 03:08.360* :  Haiti
*03:08.360- 03:11.500* :  Haiti, already one of the most dangerous countries in the world,
*03:11.500- 03:15.240* :  has hit a new low in its downward spiral of lawlessness.
*03:15.780- 03:19.280* :  A state of emergency and nighttime curfews have been imposed
*03:19.280- 03:21.580* :  after an explosion of violence this weekend.
*03:22.340- 03:24.700* :  Armed gangs stormed two of the country's biggest prisons,
*03:24.980- 03:26.400* :  freeing thousands of inmates.
*03:27.120- 03:30.860* :  Monique Kleska, a journalist and former UN official who lives in the capital
*03:30.860- 03:34.780* :  port of France says life for ordinary people there is dire.
*03:35.420- 03:37.040* :  We are very distressed.
*03:37.040- 03:45.380* :  I am terrorized by what is going on and it's not only today but the last three days
*03:45.380- 03:54.140* :  it has gone up quite a bit because the gangs have taken over the streets and taken over
*03:54.820- 03:57.680* :  the city, taken over practically to the country.
*03:58.320- 04:04.760* :  So it is a very difficult situation for policemen who are killed and people are being displaced
*04:04.760- 04:14.740* :  and some people died with the takeover of the main prison of Haiti with held about 4,000 people
*04:15.340- 04:22.120* :  and from what I understand and on the about 100 remain behind and it is a traumatizing situation.
*04:23.160- 04:26.560* :  Well among those inmates who have decided to stay in their prison cells,
*04:26.560- 04:29.380* :  rather than risk being caught up in the violence outside,
*04:30.040- 04:36.200* :  is a group of Colombian mercenaries accused of assassinating the Haitian president Jovenel Moise
*04:36.400- 04:36.980* :  three years ago.
*04:40.180- 04:43.680* :  I am an ex-military man from Colombia and I am here in this prison.
*04:44.320- 04:47.280* :  So far the press can't report on what this place is like.
*04:47.900- 04:53.780* :  I am innocent. I came here to Haiti with a job offer with a proposal made to me by an American
*04:53.780- 05:00.200* :  company. I didn't come here to hurt anyone. I found myself involved in a conspiracy that I don't
*05:00.200- 05:02.800* :  even know why I fell into at the moment.
*05:04.400- 05:09.440* :  Haiti's gangs who already control about 80 percent of border plants want to force the
*05:09.440- 05:14.900* :  Prime Minister Ariel Henri from power. He went to Kenya last week to discuss plans to send a
*05:14.900- 05:21.100* :  Kenyan-led multinational security force to Haiti. One gang leader, known as Barbecue,
*05:21.440- 05:25.420* :  told Mr. Henri to stay away, but there are reports that he may have returned.
*05:25.520- 05:29.380* :  Our correspondent in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, Barbara Pletasha,
*05:29.780- 05:31.700* :  told us more about Mr. Henri's visit.
*05:32.100- 05:36.160* :  He came in order to sign a security deal with the Kenyans that would have
*05:36.600- 05:41.820* :  removed the last major obstacle to the deployment of Kenyan police officers to Haiti.
*05:41.820- 05:47.960* :  So Kenya had promised to send a thousand police officers which would head a multinational force
*05:47.960- 05:52.720* :  aimed at bringing back law and order to the country. But that was held up in the Kenyan courts,
*05:52.720- 05:57.400* :  the high court ruled that it was unconstitutional because there wasn't a reciprocal arrangement
*05:57.400- 06:03.720* :  with Haiti. So Ariel Henri was in the country to sign that reciprocal arrangement, which in theory
*06:03.720- 06:09.480* :  would have allowed the Kenyan police to deploy. But of course, while he was here in Nairobi,
*06:09.480- 06:14.240* :  the gangs coordinated to take over the capital and try to prevent his return.
*06:14.840- 06:20.060* :  And then the question became, will he get back? What will happen now? And we understand from
*06:20.060- 06:25.540* :  Kenyan police that he did leave Nairobi at the weekend and they say that he has landed safely
*06:25.540- 06:30.360* :  back in the country in Haiti, although I'm not aware of confirmation from that end of things
*06:30.360- 06:31.780* :  that he's actually arrived.
*06:32.160- 06:36.220* :  Yeah, very difficult situation in Haiti. Already a very dangerous place.
*06:37.100- 06:43.220* :  And there have been attempts in the past to send international forces to Haiti to try to
*06:43.220- 06:45.280* :  restore order there, which haven't really worked.
*06:45.740- 06:51.100* :  Yes, and there were voices of caution about sending another international force.
*06:51.100- 06:57.100* :  Do you remember the UN was accused of sexual abuse? It was accused of spreading cholera while
*06:57.100- 07:02.200* :  its peacekeepers were there. And so there is that history. And then in Kenya itself,
*07:02.200- 07:06.880* :  you had human rights organizations saying, well, Kenyan police don't have a great human rights
*07:06.880- 07:12.220* :  record in terms of how they do their policing here. So there was caution on that end of things.
*07:12.220- 07:17.640* :  But there was also a pushback from others who opposed the mission here in Kenya. They said it was
*07:17.900- 07:22.800* :  unconstitutional, hence you had that legal challenge to the high court. But that was also
*07:22.800- 07:28.140* :  inappropriate. That Kenya has enough security challenges to deal with rather than sending
*07:28.140- 07:33.100* :  its forces elsewhere. And an actual fact, and it's not quite clear what will happen to this
*07:33.100- 07:38.600* :  force now, given what's going on in Haiti, will it be possible to deploy an international force
*07:38.620- 07:43.740* :  there? And then back here in Nairobi, you have those who oppose the whole idea, saying that they
*07:43.740- 07:48.300* :  will move to the court to continue challenging it. They're going to challenge the validity of this
*07:48.300- 07:53.660* :  reciprocal agreement. And some of them are saying, well, Mr. Henri actually isn't a legitimate leader,
*07:53.660- 07:58.940* :  given that he has basically stood down on various promises to hold elections. In fact, he was
*07:58.940- 08:04.280* :  supposed to hold them early this month. So early in February, I'm sorry. So there's still a lot
*08:04.280- 08:07.200* :  of questions really about what will happen with this multinational force.
*08:08.540- 08:14.240* :  Barbara Plett Asher in Kenya. And you can hear more about the history of Haiti's gang crisis by
*08:14.240- 08:21.780* :  searching online for BBC World Service, the explanation Haiti. As Hamas says, it's persevering
*08:21.780- 08:26.520* :  with talks on a ceasefire, despite Israel's refusal to join the negotiations. There's been
*08:26.520- 08:32.200* :  another warning that the warring Gaza could cause a wider conflict in the Middle East. This time
*08:32.200- 08:37.540* :  from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volkatook. The warring Gaza has already generated
*08:37.540- 08:44.780* :  dangerous spillover in neighboring countries. And I'm deeply concerned that in this powder
*08:45.900- 08:53.320* :  any spark could lead to a much broader configuration. This would have implications for every country
*08:53.320- 08:59.960* :  in the Middle East and many beyond it. Despite these concerns, Israel has said that it won't
*08:59.960- 09:05.580* :  attend ceasefire talks until Hamas gives it a list of all the surviving hostages in Gaza.
*09:05.580- 09:12.140* :  But a Hamas official told the BBC that was impossible under the continuing Israeli bombardment,
*09:12.140- 09:17.720* :  especially as it wasn't holding all the hostages. And in a sharpening of tone from the Biden
*09:18.500- 09:22.480* :  administration, the US Vice President Kamala Harris called on the Israeli government to do more
*09:22.480- 09:28.280* :  to aid the starving people of Gaza. She also calls for an immediate six week ceasefire.
*09:28.680- 09:32.640* :  She's meeting the Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz in Washington today.
*09:32.640- 09:37.280* :  A correspondent in Jerusalem, Yolanda Nell, has been telling me more about that, but first
*09:37.280- 09:40.840* :  she told us the latest about the Gaza ceasefire talks.
*09:41.300- 09:47.720* :  There are talks going on in Cairo, involving the Egyptian and Kateri mediators. This follows on
*09:47.720- 09:53.440* :  from agreements and they'd reached with Israel on a framework for a possible deal. Another
*09:53.440- 09:59.580* :  temporary truce lasting this time for about six weeks. And that is envisaged to go through the
*09:59.580- 10:03.980* :  Islamic holy month of Ramadan that starts in about a week. During that time you would have,
*10:03.980- 10:10.000* :  according to this deal, about 40 of the remaining Israeli hostages released from Gaza.
*10:10.600- 10:16.960* :  And in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. Now the
*10:16.960- 10:23.580* :  block at the moment concerns the fact that the Israelis haven't, it seems, sent a delegation to
*10:23.580- 10:29.400* :  Cairo saying that they want more information, first of all, from Hamas. They want an official
*10:29.500- 10:35.440* :  response to what's been called the Paris framework. And they also want, in particular, a list,
*10:35.480- 10:41.760* :  a detailed list of which Israeli hostages are still being held alive in the Gaza Strip.
*10:42.400- 10:45.660* :  And at the same time, we've heard some pretty strong words from the US Vice President,
*10:45.660- 10:52.360* :  Kamala Harris, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, talking about the suffering of the
*10:52.360- 10:58.740* :  Palestinians there. And she's due to meet a senior member of Israel's war cabinet, Benny Gantz,
*10:58.780- 11:04.320* :  at the White House, along with other senior American officials. And that apparently has displeased
*11:04.320- 11:10.100* :  Benjamin Netanyahu. Yeah, so Benny Gantz is somebody who was previously
*11:10.100- 11:17.340* :  prominent opposition figure in Israel. He joined the Israeli war cabinet, went into partnership with
*11:17.340- 11:23.140* :  the Prime Minister Netanyahu, really wanting to use his past military experience and do something
*11:23.140- 11:28.280* :  for the benefit of the country, he said. Now we understand reports in the Israeli media
*11:28.740- 11:34.360* :  that his trip to Washington has really angered the Israeli Prime Minister, who is a long-term
*11:34.360- 11:39.580* :  political rival of his, that Mr. Netanyahu refused to sign off on them and reportedly prohibited
*11:39.580- 11:44.480* :  the Israeli embassy in Washington from facilitating or attending Mr. Gantz's meetings.
*11:44.480- 11:49.860* :  There's a lot of criticism for him for that in the Israeli media and saying that he should put
*11:49.860- 11:54.640* :  national interests first. But it really gives you an indication of just how deep the domestic
*11:54.640- 12:01.540* :  divisions are and how deep the frustration of the U.S. with its long-term ally, I mean, of course,
*12:01.540- 12:07.260* :  Washington is the closest international ally of Israel. Yonant Nell in Jerusalem.
*12:08.200- 12:12.140* :  Donald Trump's only remaining challenger for the Republican presidential nomination,
*12:12.200- 12:20.680* :  Nikki Haley, has finally won a primary in Washington, D.C. This is her first victory over the former
*12:20.680- 12:25.600* :  U.S. President, and she's now earned the distinction of becoming the first woman to ever win
*12:25.600- 12:31.380* :  a Republican primary. But many doubt whether she will win anymore, given Donald Trump's sweeping
*12:31.380- 12:36.460* :  win so far, which she's expected to further consolidate on what's known as Super Tuesday,
*12:36.880- 12:42.120* :  when more than a dozen states nominate their choice. Naomi Ruckim and Use Correspondent from
*12:42.120- 12:48.480* :  CBS says Nikki Haley's victory is simply a symbolic one. It will not land Nikki Haley, the
*12:48.480- 12:54.540* :  Republican presidential nomination. But the former UN ambassador is celebrating her win last night
*12:54.540- 12:59.820* :  in Washington, D.C. In a social media post, she thanked voters in the nation's capital, saying
*12:59.820- 13:05.800* :  Republicans closest to Washington's dysfunction know that Donald Trump has brought nothing but chaos
*13:05.800- 13:10.840* :  and division for the past eight years. Still, Haley trails far behind the former president,
*13:10.840- 13:17.140* :  and he's also expected to pick up hundreds more delegates tomorrow when voters in 16 states and
*13:17.140- 13:23.080* :  territories take to the polls for Super Tuesday. Trump spoke confidently to a crowd in Virginia
*13:23.080- 13:29.060* :  this weekend after picking up more wins in Missouri, Michigan, and Idaho. Still, though, Nikki Haley
*13:29.060- 13:35.140* :  did make history last night, becoming the first woman to win a Republican primary in American history.
*13:35.460- 13:40.640* :  On a post on Truth Social, Trump attacked Haley over her previous performances in the primary
*13:40.640- 13:46.440* :  season. Meantime, though, if you look at the larger results and new CBS polling against former
*13:46.440- 13:52.020* :  President Trump and President Biden, former President Trump right now nationally is ahead by four
*13:52.020- 13:57.240* :  points, which is the most significant lead of the entire campaign. It seems the economy
*13:57.240- 14:01.980* :  is a huge issue for voters, and we will likely see that as we head into Super Tuesday tomorrow.
*14:02.400- 14:09.000* :  Naomi Ruckim from CBS. Meanwhile, some supporters of Donald Trump are reportedly creating and sharing
*14:09.000- 14:14.920* :  AI-generated fake images of black voters to encourage African Americans to vote Republican.
*14:15.640- 14:20.820* :  The BBC has found dozens of these voters, which falsely portray black people as supporting the
*14:20.820- 14:26.260* :  Republican frontrunner. There's no evidence directly linking the images to Mr. Trump's official
*14:26.260- 14:30.420* :  campaign. We heard more from our disinformation correspondent, Mariana Spring.
*14:30.860- 14:35.620* :  A lot of the images that I've uncovered as part of this investigation show Donald Trump,
*14:35.620- 14:40.360* :  alongside Black voters, one shows him with a group of women who are smiling around him,
*14:40.360- 14:44.800* :  almost like they're at a party, but on closer inspection you can see that Donald Trump actually
*14:44.800- 14:49.860* :  only has two or three fingers, not all five, and everyone looks very shiny. There are other
*14:49.860- 14:54.540* :  images that show him sitting on a porch, for example, again with a group of young black voters,
*14:54.980- 14:58.540* :  and the false suggestion that he'd stopped his motorcade in order to meet these people.
*14:59.040- 15:03.720* :  Now, there are AI-generated images of Joe Biden, but those tend to focus on him as an individual,
*15:03.720- 15:07.820* :  or him featured with other world leaders, for example, Barack Obama, the former US President,
*15:08.280- 15:12.820* :  or Vladimir Putin. They're not with groups of voters targeted in quite the same way.
*15:13.160- 15:17.080* :  Quite a sensitive group of voters for Donald Trump keeping his past history. What do we know about
*15:17.080- 15:22.780* :  who's behind these images? I've spoken to various US voters who appear to be their creators,
*15:22.780- 15:27.760* :  and who say, well, you know, it's fair game, I can make this kind of content, and it sort of bolsters
*15:28.040- 15:32.240* :  an image that I have, or perhaps other voters have, of Donald Trump. So one of the people I spoke to
*15:32.240- 15:37.520* :  was man called Mark K, who is a presenter on a conservative radio station in Florida,
*15:37.520- 15:41.720* :  and this is what I had to say when I challenged him on the image that he created and shared.
*15:42.240- 15:45.520* :  I'm not a photojournalist. I'm not out there taking pictures of what's really happening.
*15:45.520- 15:48.780* :  I'm a storyteller. I'm not claiming it is accurate. I'm not saying, hey, look,
*15:48.780- 15:54.380* :  Donald Trump was at this party with all of these African-American voters. Look how much they love him.
*15:54.620- 15:58.240* :  That wasn't the story at all. That impression though. It does give that impression. If you didn't
*15:58.240- 16:02.220* :  know it wasn't real, you'd think he's at this party, and he's met all these people who support him.
*16:02.460- 16:07.140* :  Because it's quite convincing. If anybody's voting one way or another because of one photo they see
*16:07.140- 16:13.020* :  on a Facebook page, that's a problem. You say the images are quite convincing there. How likely
*16:13.020- 16:18.360* :  is it that voters could be swayed by these pictures? I think it's a really important thing to think
*16:18.360- 16:22.820* :  about because Mark K there said, well, I don't think any single piece of content will persuade
*16:22.820- 16:27.300* :  someone to vote one way or another. What this is about in some ways is creating a certain narrative
*16:27.300- 16:31.440* :  or a certain impression about particular candidates. And one of the people I've spoken to is Cliff
*16:31.440- 16:36.060* :  Albright, who's one of the co-founders of Black voters matter. And what he said is this is part of
*16:36.060- 16:42.240* :  a very strategic narrative targeting Black voters who are a particular section of the electorate
*16:42.240- 16:47.240* :  that both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, if they are running against each other, will want to win over.
*16:47.680- 16:51.480* :  And I also tracked down some real voters because I wanted to understand what they think of this kind
*16:51.480- 16:55.900* :  of content. One of them was a man called Douglas, who lives in that Lanter. When I showed him that
*16:56.040- 17:00.620* :  one of these images, he believed it was real. It confirmed the impression he and others have about
*17:00.620- 17:05.120* :  Donald Trump's support for the Black community. And this is what he had to say about the candidates
*17:05.120- 17:09.700* :  and how disillusioned he's feeling about this year's election. Trump and Biden are dinosaurs.
*17:10.160- 17:16.140* :  Or if I had to lean my support towards either one, which I don't want to, to my opinion,
*17:16.140- 17:20.580* :  the lesser of the two evils is Donald Trump. But I don't believe in voting for the lesser of two
*17:20.580- 17:26.340* :  evils because at the end of the day, you're still voting for evil. Mariana, what is those images of
*17:26.340- 17:32.160* :  Black voters, fake images of Black voters? There's been some AI-generated content of President Biden,
*17:32.160- 17:39.080* :  including a fake but convincing audio call recently. Are we likely to see more of this kind of
*17:39.080- 17:43.280* :  thing during the campaign, do you think? I think that audio is something that I'm really worried
*17:43.280- 17:47.960* :  about because actually AI technology, when it comes to image and video, it's getting very good,
*17:48.020- 17:52.400* :  but there are still tell-tale signs like the lack of fingers or other things that you can spot in
*17:52.400- 17:56.660* :  the pictures, whereas audio can be really convincing. I think particularly when it purports to be a
*17:56.700- 18:00.880* :  secret recording or something you wouldn't expect a politician to say, but then it kind of confirms
*18:00.880- 18:06.080* :  existing biases. So I think all of these things are we have to be wary of them on our feeds

*19:49.300- 19:54.280* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The tech giant Apple has been fined nearly two
*19:54.280- 20:00.080* :  billion dollars by the European Union for breaking competition laws. The penalty is for preventing
*20:00.080- 20:06.480* :  Spotify and other music streaming companies from informing users about alternative and possibly
*20:06.480- 20:12.780* :  cheaper payment options outside the Apple App Store. The EU Commissioner, Margreta Vestaya,
*20:13.160- 20:17.140* :  said the iPhone maker had abused its dominant position in the market.
*20:45.680- 20:50.940* :  Apple has said it will appeal against the decision, saying there was no evidence consumers had been
*20:50.940- 20:56.840* :  harmed. Here's our technology reporter, Chris Vance. This has been a long-running dispute. It started
*20:56.840- 21:05.180* :  with a complaint made by Apple's big music streaming rival Spotify back in 2019. And really the
*21:05.380- 21:12.940* :  EU competition bodies have pretty much sided with Spotify and its decision in that they have
*21:12.940- 21:17.760* :  said that Apple's behaviour was anti-competitive. They've gone more further than that, and they've
*21:17.760- 21:24.720* :  said in a sense that, because of the result of Apple's action, users of iOS devices as iPhones
*21:24.720- 21:32.640* :  and tablets will have paid significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions. Needless
*21:32.640- 21:38.880* :  to say, Apple disagrees with the decision profoundly. It said in a statement that the facts simply
*21:38.880- 21:45.900* :  didn't support what the EU had decided. And as a result, Apple has said it will appeal. So you
*21:45.900- 21:53.160* :  can expect a continuing battle and Apple to fight to the nail to stop this fight to reverse this
*21:53.160- 21:59.100* :  fine. Chris Vance, it used to be one of the rare times a top Chinese leader took questions from
*21:59.100- 22:04.840* :  journalists. Since 1993, the Premier has given an annual press conference at the end of the yearly
*22:04.840- 22:11.160* :  parliamentary session. But in a sudden break with tradition, it's been cancelled ahead of Tuesday's
*22:11.160- 22:16.720* :  meeting of the National People's Congress. A correspondent in Beijing, Stephen McDonald, told us why
*22:16.720- 22:23.700* :  he thinks this was. The official reason given has been that, oh, we've got all these extra press
*22:23.700- 22:30.980* :  conferences these days with various new actors or giving media conferences. So it's not so
*22:30.980- 22:36.880* :  necessary to hear from the Premier. I think the reason that most people suspect is that it's a
*22:36.880- 22:45.820* :  deliberate downgrading of the Premier's power in order to boost Xi Jinping's power. So downgrading
*22:45.820- 22:50.440* :  of the number two leaders power in order to boost the number one leader's power. And the reason is
*22:50.440- 22:55.680* :  that it seems he doesn't want to share the limelight with anyone else, even for a couple of hours.
*22:56.320- 23:01.580* :  It is funny, these National People's Congress sessions, thousands of delegates, it's all a
*23:01.580- 23:07.460* :  bit of a show. These are pre-determined outcomes. The press conference only feels screened
*23:07.460- 23:12.980* :  questions with rehearsed answers. And so the whole thing is a sort of message from the party
*23:12.980- 23:16.880* :  leadership to the people because it's not like there's real debate going on there or anything like that.
*23:17.700- 23:23.180* :  Stephen McDonald, in Beijing, they rose to fame more than a decade ago after storming a
*23:23.180- 23:28.380* :  Moscow cathedral in protest against the Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Orthodox Church.
*23:29.120- 23:34.000* :  Now most members of the protest group Pussy Riot have fled their country, continuing their
*23:34.000- 23:39.740* :  activism from afar. The group were supporters of the former Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny
*23:39.740- 23:45.740* :  and they believe that President Putin was involved in his death. Something which the Kremlin denies.
*23:46.360- 23:52.380* :  Olga Borisova from Pussy Riot has been speaking to our reporter Megan Owen about her hopes
*23:52.720- 24:01.260* :  and fears for the future of Russia. I was 19 years old and I was a policeman in Russia.
*24:03.040- 24:09.480* :  And then I've quit after realizing what kind of places it and that the system itself is designing
*24:09.480- 24:14.500* :  the way not to protect people or like help them but protect government's interests.
*24:15.500- 24:21.220* :  You're one of the most vocal critics of Putin. How safe do you feel at the moment? Well,
*24:22.220- 24:32.340* :  I feel pretty safe because I'm in, you know, I'm not in Russia and I think in general if you will
*24:33.200- 24:41.340* :  be paranoid all the time, fear is very counterproductive. I feel more for people in Russia right now.
*24:41.340- 24:47.180* :  So if you were to go back to Russia, what would happen? I cannot say exactly because Russia is a
*24:47.180- 24:51.560* :  very unpredictable country. Sometimes it's beautiful, but most of the time it's just terrible.
*24:53.300- 25:00.560* :  Yeah, but I don't have any plans to go now. How do you view Navalny's death? After the first shock
*25:01.500- 25:07.080* :  passed, we realized that we should be more vocal and more loud and more,
*25:12.020- 25:12.440* :  sorry.
*25:18.080- 25:19.040* :  I'm going to take your time. Yeah.
*25:23.940- 25:31.200* :  Now, because he was a leader for so many people, lots of people felt that we don't have a
*25:31.200- 25:37.380* :  leader anymore so the hope is dead as well. When Julian Navalny came and said, I'm going to continue
*25:37.380- 25:42.740* :  his work, that really inspired lots of people. Navalny clearly meant a lot to you.
*25:43.680- 25:46.140* :  How do you see your role in the wake of his death?
*25:47.320- 25:53.540* :  It's like basically a signal to us that we can kill each of you one by one and you can't do
*25:53.540- 26:01.160* :  anything because we already killed the loudest of you, the brainwrester of you. And I think
*26:02.140- 26:08.820* :  as a Russian artist or a Russian activist, it's our duty. This is what we need to do.
*26:09.520- 26:13.620* :  Be vocal about this regime and try to help you cream.
*26:13.940- 26:18.780* :  Because he writes methods have divided opinion. Some critics have called them childish,
*26:18.780- 26:24.200* :  some have said that the cathedral storming was sacrilege. What would you say to critics
*26:24.200- 26:26.660* :  who don't approve of the methods that you use?
*26:28.260- 26:37.200* :  Well, we don't ask for improvement. I think we just act the way we feel it. If we look at the
*26:37.200- 26:47.880* :  early process of Busserite, the bright, provocative punk, I think it's just very beautiful
*26:47.880- 26:55.300* :  because this energy, it's completely opposite of this grey, bleak energy of those
*26:55.300- 27:01.780* :  Czechist, KGB agents that are running our country. Do you still have hope for the future of Russia?
*27:02.640- 27:07.420* :  If right now, for example, I don't know, no Putin, I don't know, he disappeared, he got killed.
*27:07.420- 27:14.420* :  We still have this society and I'm scared of this society. But I do still have hope. I still have
*27:14.420- 27:21.220* :  hope because I know so many beautiful good people like Alexey Navalny and people that are right now
*27:21.760- 27:26.700* :  coming to say goodbye to him. They do that because they have hope and they live in Russia right now
*27:26.700- 27:33.200* :  in those conditions and they still have this hope. So I don't think I have a right to not have one.
*27:35.080- 27:42.960* :  Olga Borosova of the Russian protest group, Pussy Riot. Could you live on just two dollars a day?
*27:43.260- 27:49.260* :  For a quarter of the population of Cameroon, that's a reality and some people there earn even less.
*27:49.940- 27:55.120* :  As inflation continues to hit countries around the world, the effects are being felt especially
*27:55.120- 28:00.900* :  in the Central African country where supermarket and petrol prices have continued to rise for the
*28:00.900- 28:06.800* :  last three years. Our reporter, Paul ENGY, has been finding out how people are coping.
*28:11.380- 28:16.500* :  I'm at a food market in Cameroon's capital city, I wouldn't day. Until recently, people came here
*28:16.500- 28:22.460* :  to fill their baskets with fruits, meat and fresh vegetables. But with inflation three times higher
*28:22.460- 28:27.040* :  than in 2021, Cameroonians are now having to count every frunk.
*28:29.820- 28:35.720* :  53-year-old Stella Ancho lives with 12 other family members in a tiny apartment on the
*28:35.720- 28:40.960* :  outskirts of Yawundi. But this is my family, I have this sofa, because you don't get rent.
*28:41.020- 28:47.560* :  My family is suffering. Whenever the landlord comes asking for rent, we can't afford to pay.
*28:47.560- 28:57.860* :  She takes me to see the fridge. Inside, there are only bare shelves and stands where food was one
*29:01.620- 29:06.400* :  stored. When we got here, we could buy food with small amounts of money. But now the products have
*29:06.400- 29:12.580* :  become so expensive in the market, traders told us it's because their transporters complain the
*29:12.580- 29:20.660* :  few prices have also increased. Cameroon is the seventh most expensive country in Africa,
*29:21.180- 29:26.520* :  according to an online global database of quality of life data. A quarter of Cameroonians
*29:26.800- 29:32.820* :  lives on less than $2 per day. That's enough to buy two kilos of rice, but not enough to buy
*29:32.820- 29:39.820* :  one liter of milk. Poor harvest, insecurity and low productivity are among the main causes of
*29:39.820- 29:47.280* :  rising costs. Transport has also become more expensive. The government slashed fewer subsidies
*29:47.280- 29:52.540* :  to qualify for a multi-million-dollar loan from the IMF last year. Since then,
*29:52.540- 30:03.860* :  diesel prices have increased almost 30%. The money we used to feed the family now goes
*30:03.860- 30:13.120* :  for the car. Blaze Veda is a taxi driver in Yawunday. We are just managing. We pray that the
*30:13.120- 30:18.400* :  government gives us something, so we're able to cope. At the moment, it's very difficult for us.
*30:19.620- 30:24.380* :  Cameroon's government has introduced measures aimed at cushioning the surging cost of living.
*30:24.840- 30:31.380* :  Since last year, it increased the minimum wage from $60 to $70 and gave civil servants a 10%
*30:31.380- 30:37.880* :  pay rise. But government's measures are likely to have a limited effect on most Cameroonians.
*30:38.300- 30:42.940* :  According to data from the international labor organization, around 90% of workers
*30:43.280- 30:46.980* :  operate in the informal sector like food sellers and market traders.
*30:48.920- 30:55.040* :  Kennedy Tumenta is an economist and business advisor. If the government continuously accept
*30:55.040- 31:00.580* :  the pressure from the IMF without looking at the impact of such pressure on the citizen itself,
*31:00.980- 31:04.680* :  the government should be prepared to see retaliation from the citizens at different states.
*31:04.880- 31:11.620* :  Either social unrest or many citizens will decide that Cameroon is not affordable for them and
*31:11.620- 31:17.780* :  they will have to emigrate or get out of the county. For now, people like Stella expect
*31:17.780- 31:22.980* :  their elected representatives to provide a tangible solution to feed their families.
*31:23.320- 31:26.800* :  I decry say, my God, from the hell am I only for being a house.
*31:27.260- 31:33.280* :  I'm asking the government to help me and to help pay my house rent and assist my children in school.
*31:35.960- 31:42.500* :  That report was by Paul ENGY. The SpaceX rocket carrying three US astronauts and one
*31:42.500- 31:47.660* :  Russian cosmonaut has blasted off from Florida bound for the International Space Station.
*31:48.180- 31:49.660* :  Here's the moment it took off.
*31:52.640- 32:05.880* :  7, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ignition, engines full power and liftoff of NASA crew a go Falcon.
*32:05.980- 32:12.440* :  The joint US Russian crew are on a six month mission. Space is one of the few areas where the US
*32:12.440- 32:18.640* :  and Russia continue to cooperate as Keith Cowing, a former NASA employee and the editor of the website
*32:18.680- 32:19.980* :  NASA Watch explains.
*32:48.220- 32:53.060* :  The space station is fully functional. It's got everything that's going to have and there's
*32:53.060- 32:57.360* :  something for everybody. There's biology, there's space medicine, there's material science,
*32:57.360- 33:03.180* :  there's engineering, there's communications, pretty much and they have two hundred or so different
*33:03.180- 33:07.240* :  things they'll be doing in the course of the six months that they'll be up there. They'll be
*33:07.240- 33:13.800* :  busy. When you arrive in space, some people do get a little bit of nausea and that takes a
*33:13.800- 33:19.980* :  day or so to clear. But after four or five days, the crew that's arrived is saying goodbye to the
*33:19.980- 33:24.760* :  crew that's leaving and you're pretty much in place and after a week or so you're in the groove.
*33:25.320- 33:29.340* :  And then you've got a whole series of things that you've got to do, you've got some time off
*33:29.800- 33:33.580* :  and of course there's something called the Earth below and there's a lot of looking out the
*33:33.580- 33:40.040* :  window as well and a lot of media stuff. So it's a it's a it's a choreographed series of things
*33:40.040- 33:45.380* :  with a little time off of the crew to just kind of drink in what what's going on up in space.
*33:46.180- 33:48.440* :  Keith Cowing, editor of NASA Watch.
*33:51.200- 33:55.640* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*34:08.580- 34:13.980* :  This edition was mixed by Daniel Erlich. The producer was Harry Bly. The editor is Karen Martin.
*34:13.980- 34:16.320* :  I'm Janette Gillil. Until next time. Goodbye.
*34:24.680- 34:28.520* :  Do you ever feel like money is just flying out of your account and you have no idea where it's going?
*34:28.520- 34:34.000* :  Well, I know it's all of those subscriptions. I used rocket money to help me find out what
*34:34.000- 34:38.420* :  subscriptions I'm actually spending money on and I had them cancel the ones I didn't want anymore.
