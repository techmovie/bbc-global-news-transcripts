*00:30.280- 00:34.560* :  Effects of Botox Cosmetic may spread hours to weeks after injection causing serious symptoms.
*00:34.560- 00:37.920* :  Alert your doctor right away as difficulty swallowing, speaking, breathing,
*00:37.920- 00:41.140* :  eye problems, or muscle weakness may be a sign of a life-threatening condition.
*00:41.400- 00:44.000* :  Patients with these conditions before injection are at highest risk.
*00:44.000- 00:46.540* :  Don't receive Botox Cosmetic if you have a skin infection.
*00:46.820- 00:49.420* :  Side effects may include allergic reactions, injection site pain,
*00:49.420- 00:51.720* :  headache, eyebrow and eyelid drooping and eyelid swelling.
*00:51.960- 00:53.400* :  Allergic reactions can include rash,
*00:53.540- 00:55.100* :  welts, asthma symptoms, and dizziness.
*00:55.300- 00:56.720* :  Tell your doctor about medical history.
*00:56.720- 00:59.460* :  Muscular nerve conditions including ALS or Lugeric's disease,
*00:59.460- 01:02.380* :  Myastinia Gravis, or Lambert Eden Syndrome and medications,
*01:02.380- 01:06.120* :  including botulinum toxins as these may increase the risk of serious side effects.

*01:18.900- 01:23.580* :  A gesture of kindness that cemented a love of football for one young fan.
*01:24.100- 01:30.480* :  If you were the man who gave me the Japan football jersey at Doha Airport in 2022,
*01:31.300- 01:34.660* :  please email the HappyPod so we can thank you.
*01:35.140- 01:37.840* :  This is 10-year-old Zeke and he needs our help.
*01:42.840- 01:45.600* :  From the Global News Podcast, this is the HappyPod.
*01:45.600- 01:46.540* :  I'm Harry Bly.
*01:46.900- 01:49.000* :  Also in this episode, we're in Chile.
*01:56.040- 02:00.300* :  Meet the scientists using these animals to help with their deep-sea research
*02:00.900- 02:02.660* :  and our theme of rare languages.
*02:13.500- 02:16.060* :  One listener from Northern Italy got in touch.
*02:16.400- 02:20.380* :  Hi, this is Danieleieto from San Giordzo di Nogaro, Italy.
*02:20.680- 02:22.320* :  Welcome to the HappyPod.
*02:27.920- 02:31.660* :  It's almost two years since the football world cup was held in Qatar,
*02:31.660- 02:33.620* :  with Argentina claiming victory.
*02:33.620- 02:36.400* :  But this story isn't about football itself.
*02:36.400- 02:40.480* :  We received a message from the mother of one of our younger listeners,
*02:40.880- 02:42.600* :  10-year-old Zeke from Doha.
*02:43.200- 02:46.580* :  Zeke went to watch his favourite team, Croatia, play Japan.
*02:46.580- 02:53.480* :  After the match at Doha Airport, a man gifted Zeke a 1998 Japanese World Cup
*02:53.480- 02:54.260* :  football shirt.
*02:54.840- 02:58.240* :  It's part of a football tradition where supporters swap shirts
*02:58.640- 02:59.720* :  at the end of the game.
*03:00.360- 03:04.660* :  And Zeke wants the HappyPod's help to track this man down to say thank you.
*03:05.000- 03:07.420* :  Zeke and his mum Mohana told us their story.
*03:08.340- 03:11.560* :  We enjoyed two weeks of the 2022 World Cup here.
*03:11.560- 03:12.200* :  It was amazing.
*03:12.720- 03:14.560* :  And Zeke and I were on our way to New Zealand.
*03:14.700- 03:20.040* :  And we got out of the taxi at the airport and I found out he had flip-flops on
*03:20.440- 03:21.140* :  and no jacket.
*03:21.580- 03:26.500* :  And this older Japanese man pointed to Zeke and then he pointed to his shirt
*03:26.880- 03:28.260* :  and made his way over to us.
*03:28.780- 03:33.200* :  So he just dropped his jersey right over Zeke's head
*03:33.360- 03:36.440* :  and that became Zeke's jacket for the next like three days
*03:36.440- 03:37.780* :  until we could get to the store.
*03:38.040- 03:39.580* :  And Zeke, what was that like for you?
*03:39.800- 03:41.000* :  Did you expect that gift?
*03:41.520- 03:43.720* :  No, it was actually very surprising.
*03:44.400- 03:45.780* :  I was just really cold.
*03:46.500- 03:47.900* :  And then out of nowhere he came.
*03:48.400- 03:50.680* :  Guys, Japan lost at night.
*03:50.680- 03:54.260* :  I was actually supporting the team that beat Japan.
*03:54.800- 03:55.300* :  Oh, right.
*03:56.280- 03:56.820* :  Okay.
*03:57.460- 03:57.920* :  Croatia.
*03:58.520- 04:00.240* :  My favorite player is from there.
*04:00.460- 04:01.860* :  His name is Luca Modrich.
*04:02.300- 04:03.120* :  I see.
*04:03.120- 04:05.640* :  Okay, so you were supporting Croatia and then after the match
*04:05.640- 04:08.760* :  you ended up getting the other teams jersey
*04:08.760- 04:11.020* :  but you were still you were still grateful for it.
*04:11.360- 04:11.540* :  Yeah.
*04:12.120- 04:15.540* :  And after the World Cup during like the Asian Cup
*04:15.900- 04:17.580* :  I actually started to like Japan.
*04:17.880- 04:20.640* :  He wore the jersey to the Japan Iran game
*04:20.640- 04:22.780* :  but Japan lost.
*04:23.280- 04:26.060* :  What have people said to you when they see you're wearing
*04:26.060- 04:27.880* :  the Japanese jersey?
*04:28.260- 04:31.740* :  They're very surprised because it's actually very big
*04:32.180- 04:33.560* :  or down to like my knees.
*04:34.220- 04:36.340* :  They're just happy I'm supporting their country.
*04:36.960- 04:38.040* :  And what do your friends say?
*04:38.480- 04:41.860* :  My friends usually like, Zeke, you gotta stop bringing that.
*04:42.260- 04:43.740* :  It's way too big for you.
*04:46.160- 04:48.100* :  But you're going to keep wearing it, aren't you?
*04:48.320- 04:50.340* :  Yeah, because then one day it'll fit me.
*04:50.540- 04:52.600* :  After the AFC we tried to find this gentleman
*04:52.600- 04:54.860* :  through social media just to say like,
*04:55.320- 04:57.220* :  hey, he gave this to Zeke two years ago
*04:57.440- 04:59.040* :  and he ended up wearing it to a game,
*04:59.480- 05:00.440* :  having a great time.
*05:00.440- 05:02.620* :  But we were able to find him on our own.
*05:02.660- 05:03.480* :  So...
*05:03.640- 05:04.600* :  Well, that's where we come in.
*05:04.640- 05:06.640* :  I mean, we have listeners all over the world
*05:06.640- 05:10.320* :  including Japan and we would love to help track this man down.
*05:10.460- 05:11.420* :  Are there any details?
*05:11.420- 05:14.280* :  Perhaps, Zeke, can you remember what this man looked like?
*05:14.860- 05:18.480* :  He was probably made 60s, I think.
*05:18.820- 05:19.680* :  Good guess, yeah.
*05:19.740- 05:22.720* :  And he didn't have a lot of hair, but it was gray.
*05:23.480- 05:25.100* :  And he had tiny beard.
*05:25.100- 05:28.880* :  Yeah, I thought so bad because we were in such a rush to get to our plane
*05:28.880- 05:31.500* :  that I did manage to take a picture of them together.
*05:31.500- 05:33.200* :  But it didn't even encourage me to say like,
*05:33.240- 05:34.960* :  oh, can I air drop this to you?
*05:34.960- 05:38.780* :  Or it wasn't actually until we went to the AFC game
*05:38.860- 05:41.640* :  that I was like, oh my gosh, we should try to find this guy
*05:41.840- 05:42.620* :  and let him know.
*05:43.240- 05:45.020* :  We still have the shirt and Zeke's still wearing it.
*05:45.240- 05:48.080* :  He'd very much looked professorial sort of.
*05:48.080- 05:50.240* :  He was standing outside of the Doha Airport
*05:50.840- 05:55.180* :  and I guess he was going home and that would have been around December.
*05:55.980- 05:58.460* :  I think it was 6th or 8th, 2022.
*05:58.460- 06:01.040* :  He was catching a flight from the Doha Airport.
*06:01.680- 06:04.000* :  And Zeke, if he's listening by any chance
*06:04.000- 06:06.080* :  if he's listening to the happy part right now,
*06:06.080- 06:07.480* :  what would you say to him?
*06:08.060- 06:12.340* :  I will probably just say thank you for this gift
*06:12.920- 06:16.120* :  and I hope I can just find you in the future
*06:16.800- 06:20.480* :  and just give you my jersey in the future, I mean.
*06:20.680- 06:21.120* :  Jersey.
*06:21.680- 06:23.780* :  Is there a Katari jersey?
*06:24.500- 06:25.560* :  We can go get one.
*06:25.700- 06:26.020* :  Yeah.
*06:26.780- 06:30.940* :  I would say just thank you for taking the time
*06:31.020- 06:33.280* :  out to just spread the love of the ball.
*06:33.680- 06:36.540* :  Thanks for telling us about a whole tradition.
*06:36.540- 06:38.520* :  We might not have the experience otherwise.
*06:39.120- 06:41.200* :  Mojana, Raja Kumar and Zeke.
*06:41.940- 06:45.540* :  We've talked before about exploring the depths of the ocean.
*06:45.840- 06:48.100* :  In November, we learnt about newly discovered
*06:48.100- 06:50.840* :  cold water reefs off the Galapagot Islands.
*06:51.420- 06:53.980* :  Research like this normally uses complex,
*06:53.980- 06:56.440* :  remotely operated underwater vehicles.
*06:57.060- 07:00.600* :  But one team in Chile are using a very different type of vehicle
*07:00.880- 07:02.380* :  for their deep sea research.
*07:06.920- 07:10.340* :  They're relying on a group of southern elephant seals.
*07:10.900- 07:14.660* :  At up to five meters long and weighing over 4,000 kilograms,
*07:14.660- 07:17.840* :  these enormous creatures have monitoring equipment
*07:17.840- 07:21.620* :  attached to their bodies and over time will collect information
*07:21.620- 07:25.500* :  about the waters they swim through and their own migration patterns.
*07:26.160- 07:28.980* :  These seals were chosen because of their ability to dive
*07:28.980- 07:31.000* :  as deep as 2,000 meters.
*07:31.680- 07:35.880* :  Maritza Sepulveda, a marine ecologist at the University of Valparaiso,
*07:36.140- 07:38.320* :  in central Chile is leading the project.
*07:39.000- 07:42.240* :  They are really noisy and it is very interesting because
*07:42.640- 07:46.900* :  in the breathing season, each male has different sounds.
*07:51.960- 07:56.240* :  So different males can recognize each other using the noise.
*07:56.240- 07:59.700* :  They learn about the neighborhood, the neighbor.
*08:00.320- 08:04.800* :  And if, for instance, is that male is dangerous to me or not?
*08:04.800- 08:08.800* :  It is very interesting because some males in the breathing season
*08:08.800- 08:12.800* :  can have 80 to 100 females each male.
*08:13.360- 08:16.040* :  So to these elephant seals, you and your team have fitted
*08:16.100- 08:19.000* :  satellite transmitters to them.
*08:19.600- 08:21.140* :  How on earth did you do that?
*08:22.940- 08:24.120* :  Well, it's not so easy.
*08:24.120- 08:30.000* :  The veterinary was behind the animal just trying to not to be seen
*08:30.460- 08:33.660* :  and put at the stage six just to relax and the animals
*08:33.660- 08:35.000* :  goes asleep.
*08:35.000- 08:40.000* :  And after that, the rest of the team collects some samples,
*08:40.880- 08:44.660* :  measure, weight, the animal, and also to put the text.
*08:44.900- 08:46.380* :  So reassure me here.
*08:46.380- 08:48.760* :  It doesn't hurt them, does it, when they're wearing this device?
*08:49.480- 08:52.900* :  No, no, not at all because you use very strong glue
*08:53.260- 08:54.900* :  that we put on the hair.
*08:55.040- 08:57.020* :  So it's really not painful at all.
*08:57.480- 09:00.140* :  And so far, what have you been able to find out
*09:00.140- 09:03.100* :  about elephant seals that you didn't know already?
*09:03.560- 09:10.060* :  We put six devices and we are seeing that the different animals
*09:10.680- 09:13.440* :  have different foraging behavior.
*09:13.440- 09:16.340* :  So the information we are collecting is really new.
*09:16.980- 09:19.080* :  And of course, this is not just about seals.
*09:19.080- 09:24.560* :  You're also gathering data and researching the ocean under the sea.
*09:25.360- 09:27.740* :  What are you hoping to measure and perhaps discover?
*09:28.440- 09:31.960* :  The oceanography studies are really expensive.
*09:32.340- 09:35.820* :  And the area, the fures of South and Chile
*09:36.440- 09:38.120* :  are very complicated to reach.
*09:38.120- 09:41.200* :  And some places never been studied before.
*09:41.760- 09:45.660* :  So we are using the animals as oceanographers.
*09:46.360- 09:49.500* :  Yes, so it's almost like you've employed the elephant seals
*09:49.700- 09:52.480* :  as like exploration vehicles almost.
*09:52.480- 09:54.120* :  They've got the tech on them.
*09:54.120- 09:58.060* :  And then they're exploring the ocean and sending you data back.
*09:58.060- 10:00.800* :  I mean, tell me Merit, so what's the bigger picture?
*10:00.800- 10:03.720* :  What is this information going to be used for?
*10:03.880- 10:06.780* :  And perhaps what can it tell us?
*10:07.340- 10:10.860* :  You know that the southern Chile, the situation
*10:11.300- 10:14.580* :  and the habitat is changing a lot and so fast.
*10:15.240- 10:18.700* :  So by using this information, we will be able to modulate
*10:19.280- 10:23.680* :  how we are expecting to change due to the climate change.
*10:24.300- 10:25.200* :  It's wonderful, isn't it?
*10:25.200- 10:28.860* :  Because in a way, it's like these elephant seals are actually going out there
*10:28.860- 10:31.620* :  and telling us about the ocean, as opposed to us going down
*10:31.620- 10:33.780* :  and seeing it for ourselves as humans.
*10:33.780- 10:37.200* :  That is, what's this experience been like for you as a scientist?
*10:38.000- 10:43.740* :  This project to me is really new because for the first time in my academic life,
*10:44.360- 10:49.840* :  I am using animals just to be like you say by employees
*10:50.440- 10:53.260* :  to try to investigate a different thing.
*10:53.740- 10:56.620* :  We are really proud to be able to work with different people
*10:56.620- 10:59.640* :  and to understand and to learn new things.
*11:03.360- 11:07.560* :  Now, some good news about one of the world's most critically endangered species,
*11:08.080- 11:09.500* :  the mountain chicken frog.
*11:10.060- 11:14.080* :  These extra-large amphibians used to be found on a number of Caribbean islands,
*11:14.720- 11:18.480* :  but scientists say there are now only a few dozen left in the wild.
*11:19.160- 11:22.800* :  So the arrival of six baby mountain chicken frogs at London Zoo
*11:23.240- 11:24.660* :  has been something to celebrate.
*11:25.260- 11:27.620* :  Our reporter Jacob Evans went to find out more.
*11:31.440- 11:35.200* :  This is a big frog, a big frog with a lot of responsibility.
*11:38.480- 11:42.540* :  This big guy weighs in at about a kilo, and now he's a new dad.
*11:43.300- 11:48.580* :  A new dad to six little froglets that spawned right here in London Zoo just a few weeks ago.
*11:49.260- 11:52.680* :  And if you can hear that hissing, it's because these frogs are so rare,
*11:53.040- 11:56.660* :  they kept in a biosecure unit which is carefully regulated here in the zoo.
*11:58.140- 12:02.980* :  Once widespread across the lesser Antilles, the mountain chicken frog is the largest native
*12:02.980- 12:08.600* :  frog in the Caribbean. It's named after its big, back legs, which used to be a local delicacy
*12:08.600- 12:11.340* :  that supposedly, like everything, tasted like chicken.
*12:11.940- 12:16.040* :  And if you pick them up, supposedly they make a squawking noise, a bit like a chicken.
*12:16.540- 12:20.540* :  But the compounding effects of natural and human pressures decimated the population.
*12:21.520- 12:24.560* :  Ben Tapley is the curator of reptiles and amphibians here at the zoo.
*12:25.480- 12:30.800* :  So this is a species that has undergone the fastest ever documented decline of a vertebrate,
*12:31.080- 12:36.040* :  due to disease. The mountain chicken frogs were found on about seven different Caribbean islands
*12:36.040- 12:41.080* :  historically and they disappeared. I guess at the time where the islands were colonized by
*12:41.080- 12:45.500* :  Europeans and the Mongoose was introduced. So they remained in just two islands, Montserrat and
*12:45.500- 12:49.460* :  Dominica. They're probably extinct in the wild on Montserrat.
*12:49.940- 12:55.740* :  And on Dominica there are an estimated about 30 frogs remaining. So this species is in
*12:55.740- 12:59.960* :  serious, serious trouble. As the frogs headed toward extinction,
*12:59.960- 13:05.020* :  a collaboration involving London Zoo saw a handful of those that remained airlifted from
*13:05.020- 13:07.880* :  the island of Dominica in a last-ditch attempt to save them.
*13:09.920- 13:13.640* :  So as you can hear, it's quite echoing here and that's because we're in the amphibian
*13:13.640- 13:19.560* :  exhibit at the zoo, which isn't yet open to the public. And behind the glass pane in front of
*13:19.560- 13:25.260* :  me are the mountain chicken frogs. I can see them there. Just pitching under the leaves,
*13:25.320- 13:30.080* :  they've got lovely clay flats, they've got a pond for them to rest in and they've got a lot of
*13:30.080- 13:34.160* :  rocks aside of the wall because they like to climb and they've got lots of plants for cover.
*13:34.340- 13:39.440* :  And then of course this biosecule unit has exact humidity, temperature and light needed for the
*13:39.440- 13:44.180* :  frogs. And Zookeeper Jamie Mitchell looks after these frogs every day.
*13:44.500- 13:49.180* :  There are some some individuals that as soon as they see me will duck off into the nest or go and
*13:49.180- 13:53.780* :  hide. There are other individuals that will just sit there quite happily while I'm doing my
*13:53.800- 13:57.960* :  full servicing, draining the pond, scrubbing it out, refilling it and they just sit there and
*13:57.960- 14:01.540* :  completely ignore me. What are they like as parents with my chicken?
*14:02.460- 14:07.000* :  Protective, very protective. Whenever I'm doing nest checks I have to be fairly quiet
*14:07.380- 14:11.880* :  and fairly swift about checking and then moving away because if you hang around too long they
*14:11.880- 14:17.300* :  will head back you to make you go away. The six new babies have been celebrated by conservationists
*14:17.380- 14:21.200* :  who hope their arrival will help pull the species back from the brink of extinction.
*14:21.800- 14:27.800* :  They estimate the wild population is 30, right? On Dominica so having six I can't kind of
*14:27.800- 14:33.640* :  emphasise how it excited be worth to see that it's little metamorphosing around in the nest.
*14:33.640- 14:40.060* :  Ben Tapley from London Zoo ending that report by Jacob Evans. Last week one of our colleagues
*14:40.060- 14:46.840* :  from the BBC's Latin America service Carlos Serrano woke up to find a crowd staring up at his home.
*14:47.440- 14:52.060* :  But they weren't there for him. Instead they were looking at a mural that had been painted on a
*14:52.060- 14:58.800* :  wall right outside his window which was unmistakably the work of the world famous graffiti artist
*14:59.180- 15:03.720* :  Banksy. If you haven't seen a photo of it the painting which is here in London features
*15:03.720- 15:09.300* :  swathes of green paint on a wall behind a nearby tree to give the appearance of leaves.
*15:09.340- 15:16.500* :  Tim Franks asked Carlos what it's been like. It's been crazy busy and really really fun. You see
*15:16.500- 15:23.420* :  a lot of people just in front of my window looking to the wall and smiling to me and asking me if they
*15:23.420- 15:28.920* :  can go in the garden to take a picture so it's a lot of attention but I really cool with that.
*15:29.260- 15:32.920* :  Am I right in thinking that some of them thought that you might be the artist in several?
*15:33.640- 15:38.640* :  That's a very common question and I have been getting these days. People are you Banksy
*15:39.120- 15:45.740* :  and as in the movies my answer is can confer Northern. Oh perfect perfect so you're keeping the
*15:45.740- 15:52.580* :  mystery there. All this attention. Is it slightly wearing at the same time? I mean for some people
*15:52.580- 15:58.400* :  could be a little bit intimidating and from Colombia I come from the Caribbean when we are people
*15:58.400- 16:03.240* :  you know like very friendly, very extroverts. Here in London sometimes we think people are more
*16:03.240- 16:08.980* :  serious, my introvert. I have been discovering a new kind of Londoners people very open to talk,
*16:08.980- 16:15.220* :  to have fun in this place. I think this this moral is making the neighborhood come together as
*16:15.220- 16:19.140* :  a community. I don't feel part of that. Carlos Serrano from BBC Mundo.
*16:24.380- 16:29.540* :  Coming up in this podcast. It was open for four days where it had no obvious loss and pressure.
*16:29.600- 16:33.420* :  The thing was really warring. Some of the people who were there at the time said it sounded a bit
*16:33.420- 16:39.840* :  like being close to the back end of a jet engine. A vast deposit of precious gas found in Minnesota.
*16:49.880- 16:54.580* :  Hey I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*16:54.840- 16:59.780* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally when they announce they'd be raising
*16:59.780- 17:04.960* :  their prices due to inflation we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*17:05.220- 17:10.260* :  That's right we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*17:10.260- 17:15.280* :  Give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch. 45 dollars upfront for three months plus taxes and fees
*17:15.280- 17:19.460* :  Promoting for new customers for limited time unlimited more than 40 gigabytes per month slows full turns at MintMobile.com
*17:23.480- 17:26.780* :  You may have heard on the Global News Podcast about Jasmine Paris.
*17:26.780- 17:32.580* :  She's become the only woman ever to complete one of the world's toughest ultra-marathons.
*17:32.880- 17:37.800* :  The Barclay Marathons in Tennessee in the US. Well earlier this month there was another
*17:37.800- 17:45.520* :  incredible running achievement this time in California. Camille Huron ran 901 kilometers in just
*17:45.560- 17:51.820* :  six days. That's further than running from New York to Washington and back. It's the furthest
*17:51.820- 17:59.120* :  anyone's ever run in that time and along the way she broke 11 world records many of them her own.
*17:59.580- 18:06.320* :  Camille who's 42 and from Norman in Oklahoma told Sportsworld's Nishat Ladder about her achievement.
*18:06.840- 18:14.160* :  This went so far beyond the typical muscle, brain, pain, and fatigue. I started feeling my organs
*18:14.160- 18:20.960* :  being like bumper cars. My bladder was the first to go and then I started my period and had
*18:20.960- 18:27.240* :  menstrual cramps, all that type of nausea and fatigue and then my bowels went by like day four,
*18:27.240- 18:33.660* :  day five and that kind of became the limit to trying to push those last couple days.
*18:33.660- 18:40.000* :  Did you think that quitting at all? No, never thought about quitting. Never thought about quitting.
*18:40.000- 18:47.440* :  I'd already prepared my mind before the race. I'm just a really happy positive person so even in my
*18:47.440- 18:53.220* :  most dire moments I was kind of finding a sense of humor about what I was going through and
*18:53.540- 18:59.120* :  and I mean each time I set a record I had to readjust my goals and go for the next record and so
*18:59.120- 19:04.680* :  that just really kept me inspired and motivated as I kept going and the days kept passing along.
*19:04.680- 19:11.020* :  How important is it for you to talk about what your body was going through during this extraordinary
*19:11.020- 19:17.600* :  feat? When I talked about my first experience of having my period during an ultra two years ago
*19:17.600- 19:23.720* :  that ended up being the thing that resonated with a lot of women. A lot of women being like that's
*19:23.720- 19:29.540* :  happened to me like thank you for talking about it and now that I'm in my 40s I mean I'm still
*19:29.540- 19:35.060* :  breaking records. I'm still pushing my human limits and I just think it goes to show to other women,
*19:35.060- 19:42.640* :  other especially teenage girls that having a period is power. It makes me strong. It makes me
*19:42.640- 19:48.540* :  healthy. I'm able to continue to go through life and you know do these amazing things so I mean
*19:48.540- 19:54.840* :  now I'm going through paraminopause and that's another topic in itself. And let's talk about some
*19:54.840- 20:00.400* :  of the other challenges during this event. Many people wonder when you're running an ultra like this.
*20:00.920- 20:07.820* :  How do you sleep? How do you eat? What do you eat? I mean there's a lot of planning and methodology
*20:07.820- 20:15.360* :  that went into it every four hours I was taking a small mill which might be like tacos or
*20:15.800- 20:20.940* :  what chicken teriyaki. I had so many things you know over six days. I felt like by day four
*20:20.940- 20:26.640* :  I started getting ravenously hungry and so they had to go do some runs to get donuts and
*20:26.640- 20:32.860* :  more tacos and cheese and crackers and then in terms of sleep I average something like 90 minutes
*20:32.860- 20:40.120* :  a day of sleep which is crazy for six days. Take me back to the end. What was that like to
*20:40.760- 20:47.060* :  complete it and know that you'd succeeded? I'm still trying to process it all because it was just
*20:47.060- 20:54.320* :  such a monumental journey and dream come true and I mean it's just like mind blowing what we did.
*20:54.960- 21:00.020* :  I've been through so many struggles in my life that I feel like that those struggles are what
*21:00.020- 21:05.440* :  helped me get through the struggles I enter when I'm running, whether I'm training or racing. I mean
*21:05.440- 21:10.520* :  running makes life better. It makes it more interesting and makes it more fun. I feel like this
*21:10.520- 21:15.660* :  is just what I'm born to do. I'm born to run and pushed my human limits. Camille Heron
*21:15.940- 21:20.900* :  and you can hear more of that interview on Sportsworld from the BBC World Service wherever you
*21:20.900- 21:27.960* :  found this podcast. To a story that's anything but dead air, scientists in the US are celebrating
*21:27.960- 21:34.280* :  what they're calling a dream discovery of helium buried deep in Minnesota's iron range.
*21:35.000- 21:40.140* :  The natural gas is hard to find and is in hot demand and it's not just for balloons.
*21:40.920- 21:46.860* :  I spoke to Thomas Abraham James, the CEO of Pulsar Helium, the company behind the find.
*21:47.740- 21:52.960* :  We were very fortunate so this was on our radar as a place to go but what happened was that there
*21:52.960- 21:56.720* :  was a company out there doing exploration for a different commodity that they were looking for
*21:56.720- 22:03.460* :  nickel and they were drilling down and then unexpectedly they hit gas and I can only imagine at
*22:03.460- 22:09.320* :  the time it must have been terrifying the gas was under high pressure so much so that inside the
*22:09.320- 22:14.620* :  drill tube inside the drill string there was about roughly about three meters worth of rock in it
*22:14.960- 22:19.860* :  and it's shot out from 600 meters depth out the top of the drill rig and then like a projectile
*22:19.860- 22:24.120* :  off into the distance the gas was under such high pressure. Some of the people who were there at
*22:24.120- 22:28.560* :  the time said it sounded a bit like being close to the back end of a jet engine. Some brave
*22:28.560- 22:33.220* :  geologists there they sampled the gas and they found that it was 10 and a half percent helium
*22:33.740- 22:36.840* :  which makes it one of the greatest helium discoveries on the planet.
*22:37.360- 22:42.020* :  What was that eureka moment like when you realized this is a big significant discovery?
*22:42.620- 22:47.760* :  It's not terribly spectacular in the sense of the old oil discoveries we had oil going everywhere
*22:47.760- 22:52.900* :  or gas exploding out but we certainly saw them the dials and then the numbers going up and then
*22:52.900- 22:57.720* :  there was all of a sudden from going to no helium to bang all of a sudden you see these
*22:57.720- 23:03.520* :  astronomically high concentrations and it was pure relation combined with pure relief as
*23:03.520- 23:07.720* :  well to be honest to say that we actually did it so it's incredibly satisfying.
*23:08.260- 23:16.480* :  The idea that helium is most commonly used in balloons it's got a whole host of really important
*23:16.480- 23:21.480* :  uses we've got welding we've got MRI machines we've got you know scientific research
*23:22.320- 23:27.980* :  will this discovery potentially negate the risk of running out of helium because that has been
*23:27.980- 23:34.320* :  a concern it is an endangered element on earth isn't it? It really is it's very finite that's
*23:34.320- 23:39.920* :  the reason why we exist by pulsar exists is to try and alleviate that shortage so it's typically
*23:39.920- 23:45.320* :  at universities and research that get hit they can't get the helium they need to do their analytics
*23:45.320- 23:51.100* :  the hospitals are a big one as well so where they haven't got you know the budget or the ability
*23:51.100- 23:56.300* :  to get helium for the MRI scanners which is a huge user and then the other one which is the
*23:56.300- 24:02.420* :  big is for semiconductors in their fabrication so now certainly with the AI boom and the processing
*24:02.420- 24:08.640* :  power that's required helium is essential for that a space launch so each time you see a rocket
*24:08.640- 24:12.500* :  there about to take off on the launch pad that you've got the gas coming out the side of it
*24:13.020- 24:18.860* :  that's typically helium boiling off at negative 269 degrees Celsius so there's a whole range of
*24:18.900- 24:24.740* :  things that we really rely on so we really hope and we're working very hard to try and give
*24:24.740- 24:31.680* :  that alternate supply. Thomas Abraham James from pulsar helium we've been asking you the listener
*24:31.680- 24:38.320* :  to get in touch about your rare languages well Daniela Yeateri emailed us to tell us about his
*24:38.320- 24:44.720* :  own mother tongue for the land from northern Italy and his work helping to preserve others
*24:45.180- 24:49.980* :  he's a documentary filmmaker and helps run part of the Bolzano film festival
*24:49.980- 24:55.680* :  dedicated to what it calls linguistic minorities this year's entries have just been announced
*25:14.780- 25:24.580* :  a flavor there of films in Kurdish Luxembourgish and Algerian Berber I spoke to Daniela and started
*25:24.580- 25:31.020* :  by asking him about his own small language the language is spoken in the south of the Alps in the
*25:31.680- 25:38.480* :  region that is named for you even it's a room yeah so in part of this region people there speak
*25:39.180- 25:45.440* :  maybe four four hundred thousand speakers quite a large number for a small language
*25:45.780- 25:52.540* :  and it's from northern Italy how similar is it to Italian there are many many similarities of course
*25:52.620- 26:01.280* :  but then it has a vocabulary that is quite peculiar so perhaps we could hear a little bit of
*26:01.280- 26:08.620* :  foreign if I may say I expected the questions so I I prepared something I found a few lines
*26:08.620- 26:15.280* :  from the little prince that the very well-known book by Antoine de Sant'Ezupéry de Petit Ponce
*26:15.800- 26:22.800* :  and so the title would be it featured in it quite a few years ago so if you do to an evolved
*26:22.800- 26:29.300* :  into a leader the story is very so so far as the virgin an epitur and tambien and must have
*26:29.300- 26:37.400* :  been born in the west of the region it's really interesting because I can very much tell it's
*26:37.400- 26:45.400* :  it's it's of that region and yeah you work with other small languages as well for the the
*26:45.400- 26:52.560* :  Bolzano festival tell me about some of the other small languages that you've learned about
*26:53.200- 27:00.420* :  there are a set of languages small languages very well known so you know that in Sardinia for
*27:00.420- 27:08.660* :  example in Italy they have their own language you know about the basque language etc then there
*27:08.660- 27:15.880* :  are endangered languages languages that are disappearing and finally surprising ones for example
*27:15.880- 27:23.560* :  in the canaliens islands a language that uses only whistles so as someone that speaks a small
*27:23.580- 27:31.900* :  rare language why is it important to preserve these minority languages so I've been learning
*27:31.900- 27:38.900* :  many other languages in my life and was important for me to keep my own mother tongue
*27:39.420- 27:46.500* :  not because I'm looking to the past but because it's part of me frequently small languages
*27:46.500- 27:53.380* :  minority languages are spoken in places that are far from the big metropolitan areas and then
*27:53.380- 28:00.800* :  as a person living at periphery the language is is something that keeps you alive and keeps
*28:00.800- 28:08.020* :  your your your possibility to represent yourself towards the big centers you feel less peripheral if
*28:08.020- 28:15.200* :  you keep something running with that is part of your culture somehow the if you want I can just
*28:15.200- 28:22.560* :  teach you is the thing of course yeah our the first word you would learn in swatang is the way we say
*28:22.560- 28:31.440* :  hello and we say mandi mandi mandi this is the way how we say hello goodbye ciao it's it's our ciao
*28:32.760- 28:38.940* :  daniele iatari and a thank you to those who got in touch about the fish doorbell from last week's
*28:38.940- 28:45.040* :  episode in case you missed it it's exactly how it sounds a video doorbell for fish that you the
*28:45.040- 28:50.980* :  human presses when you see a fish because of course fish don't have hands here's Samantha Campbell
*28:50.980- 28:56.660* :  from Winnipeg in Canada so I found the fish doorbell from a video on Instagram I recently moved out
*28:56.660- 29:01.560* :  of a rural area to big city and I really miss fishing so I love being able to see all the fish
*29:01.560- 29:08.160* :  swim by my record is nine fish at once and the coolest thing I've ever seen is a crab thanks
*29:14.340- 29:19.580* :  Samantha and that's all for this week we've heard lots from you the listener please do stay in
*29:19.580- 29:24.900* :  touch we always want to hear about your languages or the fish doorbell or a story that made you
*29:24.900- 29:33.560* :  smile as ever the address well here's Zeke again global podcast at bbc.co.uk
*29:34.200- 29:42.400* :  thanks Zeke that's global podcast at bbc.co.uk this edition was mixed by Daniel Ehrlich the producers
