*00:19.280- 00:22.600* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Tuesday,
*00:22.600- 00:27.980* :  the 19th of March. The US and Israeli leaders speak for the first time in more than a month
*00:27.980- 00:30.980* :  amid concern over Israel's planned assault on Raffa.
*00:31.180- 00:36.220* :  Israel has not presented us or the world with a plan for how or where they would safely move
*00:36.220- 00:41.560* :  those civilians, let alone feed and house them and ensure access to basic things like sanitation.
*00:41.560- 00:48.560* :  We also hear about fears of famine in Gaza. Donald Trump's lawyers say he can't raise the almost
*00:48.560- 00:54.320* :  half a billion dollars he needs to appeal against a fraud judgment. And Pakistan confirms it's
*00:54.320- 00:57.280* :  carried out airstrikes inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.
*01:00.220- 01:05.120* :  Also in the podcast, the Gambia votes to bring back female genital mutilation.
*01:16.820- 01:20.780* :  And the cash points in Ethiopia giving out too much money.
*01:25.920- 01:31.080* :  The US has traditionally been Israel's strongest ally, but the Israeli military offensive against
*01:31.080- 01:36.640* :  Hamas in Gaza is stretching ties to the limit. On Monday, for the first time in more than a month,
*01:36.640- 01:42.060* :  the US President Joe Biden spoke to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Nesanyahu by phone.
*01:42.140- 01:46.900* :  The US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said they had discussed the planned Israeli
*01:46.900- 01:53.520* :  offensive on the southern Gaza City of Raffa. More than a million people have taken refuge in Raffa.
*01:53.520- 01:59.140* :  They went from Gaza City to Kahn Unis and then to Raffa. They have nowhere else to go.
*01:59.140- 02:05.300* :  Gaza's other major cities have largely been destroyed. And Israel has not presented us or the world
*02:05.300- 02:11.020* :  with a plan for how or where they would safely move those civilians, let alone feed and house
*02:11.020- 02:17.280* :  them and ensure access to basic things like sanitation. Jake Sullivan earlier, a UN-backed assessment
*02:17.280- 02:23.840* :  said that mass deaths were imminent in Gaza as a result of famine. Our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*02:23.840- 02:28.960* :  Mark Lowe, and told us more about that. But first, I got his assessment on the conversation between
*02:28.960- 02:33.440* :  the two leaders. Well, it comes amid a period of real acrimony between the two governments.
*02:33.440- 02:38.700* :  Solly, I mean, last week, the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in the US in effect called for
*02:38.700- 02:44.120* :  Netanyahu's replacement, calling them an obstacle to peace and President Biden then endorsed Chuck
*02:44.120- 02:48.660* :  Schumer's remarks. So the relationship between the two men who have known each other for decades
*02:48.700- 02:53.900* :  is at a very low level. I mean, Jake Sullivan today said that the conversation was business-like.
*02:53.900- 02:59.840* :  It did not end abruptly, he said. But he was clear that Israel's government needs to do much more
*02:59.840- 03:04.740* :  humanitarian front, needs to present a much more credible plan if it is going to move into Raffa
*03:04.740- 03:09.980* :  in order to evacuate some 1.4 million people there. And interestingly, he also said that Israel
*03:09.980- 03:15.100* :  has said it would send an interagency team, as he put it to the US, to discuss the Raffa
*03:15.100- 03:20.060* :  operation. So that suggests that the Israeli government is very determined to push into Raffa
*03:20.140- 03:24.940* :  against all the international warnings of what that would mean, but also that it recognizes that
*03:24.940- 03:29.800* :  there needs to be more preparation before that happens. And Jake Sullivan also said that those
*03:29.800- 03:36.540* :  suggestions that Gaza could soon be hit by a famine were alarming. What more can you tell us
*03:36.540- 03:42.500* :  about the details of that? Yeah, this was a report that was backed by several UN bodies and aid
*03:42.500- 03:48.320* :  agencies, which said that unless the humanitarian situation is turned around, unless the fighting is
*03:48.320- 03:54.100* :  halted, northern Gaza, there would be officially a declaration of famine by the end of May.
*03:54.580- 04:00.240* :  A fifth of the population faces a really catastrophic food insecurity. One of three children
*04:00.240- 04:05.340* :  are severely acutely malmourished. So that gives you a sense of just how disastrous the situation
*04:05.340- 04:10.320* :  is in the north. And the report also said that 1.1 million people are now facing catastrophic
*04:10.320- 04:16.520* :  food insecurity. And that is a very extremely high level that has only been surpassed by Somalia
*04:16.520- 04:22.200* :  and South Sudan in the last decade or so. Israel has been criticized from all quarters today over
*04:22.200- 04:27.660* :  that. The EU's foreign policy chief, Joseph Barrel, said that Israel was using starvation as a
*04:27.660- 04:33.400* :  weapon of war in Gaza. Israel has consistently said that it is Hamas that is disrupting the aid
*04:33.400- 04:38.000* :  distribution effort. But, frankly, it has been very clear that Israel has been holding up
*04:38.380- 04:43.420* :  aid deliveries by land. It has limited the entry points of trucks going into Gaza. It has
*04:43.620- 04:47.540* :  performed extremely cumbersome checks on trucks. I think the basic message is that
*04:47.540- 04:53.540* :  Gazans are dying of starvation. And briefly, the significance of the fact that Israel has again
*04:53.540- 05:00.480* :  attacked Ashifah Hospital in northern Gaza. This is Gaza's largest hospital that Israeli forces
*05:00.480- 05:04.540* :  attacked back in November, saying that it was used as a Hamas command centre. They've now launched
*05:04.540- 05:10.880* :  another raid Monday morning. And they say that they killed Hamas's head of internal security who
*05:10.880- 05:16.760* :  was armed inside. They detained 80 people. If this is confirmed, the death and the fighting
*05:16.760- 05:22.140* :  there would suggest that Hamas is regrouping in the north, which is an area that Israeli troops
*05:22.140- 05:26.780* :  had largely pulled out of, which is pretty bad news for the Israeli military and suggests that
*05:26.780- 05:31.080* :  their war aims are simply just not going according to plan. Mark Lohan in Jerusalem
*05:32.020- 05:36.500* :  Over the past few days, meanwhile, the Houthis in Yemen have again targeted merchant shipping
*05:36.500- 05:41.740* :  in the Red Sea. The flow of trade has been seriously disrupted by their drone and missile
*05:41.740- 05:46.720* :  strikes, which began after Israel's assault on Gaza. The US and Britain have sent warships,
*05:46.720- 05:51.940* :  but they have failed to stop the Houthi attacks. The American fleet is led by the aircraft carrier
*05:51.940- 05:56.640* :  the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which has been targeting the Houthis for more than four months.
*05:56.640- 06:00.080* :  Our defence correspondent Jonathan Bill has been on board.
*06:06.140- 06:13.140* :  The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower has been launching dozens of sorties with its F-18s day and night
*06:13.320- 06:14.680* :  for more than four months now.
*06:19.400- 06:24.400* :  The jets on board tell the story of what they've been doing. The tally of the bombs they've
*06:24.400- 06:30.400* :  dropped and drones they've shot down painted on the side of cockpits. Their mission has been
*06:30.400- 06:36.220* :  to protect merchant vessels in the Red Sea, a key trade route. Several cargo ships have already
*06:36.220- 06:43.620* :  been hit by Houthi drones and missiles, but US and coalition warships are being targeted too.
*06:44.460- 06:49.880* :  Captain Dave Rowe, the commander of US Navy, destroys which are part of the carrier strike group,
*06:50.260- 06:56.700* :  says it's been the most challenging operation in recent US naval history, with the Houthis using
*06:56.700- 07:02.360* :  increasingly sophisticated drones. This is deadly stuff. This is the most since World War Two.
*07:03.140- 07:07.140* :  Easily. What the most intense? Oh, we very much so. You know ballistic missiles,
*07:07.140- 07:13.920* :  anti-shake cruise missiles, UAVs, now USVs or underwater vessels. The game is all out there
*07:14.020- 07:16.000* :  and we've been doing this for almost four months now.
*07:19.880- 07:25.480* :  The overall carrier strike group commander, Rear Admiral Megez, says the Houthis are not acting
*07:25.480- 07:31.580* :  alone. He says Iran is providing them with both weapons and intelligence. American and
*07:31.580- 07:36.860* :  British coordinated air strikes have already destroyed some of the Houthis arsenal, but they've
*07:36.860- 07:44.240* :  not been deterred and these remain extremely dangerous waters. Jonathan Bill reporting from the Red
*07:44.240- 07:50.600* :  Sea. Donald Trump prides himself on his business acumen, but it seems the former US President
*07:50.600- 07:56.800* :  may not be as good with money as he makes out. His lawyers say he can't access the funds he needs
*07:56.800- 08:01.240* :  to appeal against a fraud judgment, which is for overinflating the value of his properties.
*08:01.260- 08:04.400* :  On New York correspondent Nettael Freak has the details.
*08:04.980- 08:10.380* :  A bond company takes on the responsibility for any payout if a defendant loses on appeal and
*08:10.380- 08:15.580* :  is unable to pay. According to Donald Trump's lawyers, obtaining a bond has proven to be a
*08:15.580- 08:21.440* :  practical impossibility after approaching roughly 30 such companies. Very few, they say,
*08:21.440- 08:26.760* :  will even consider giving him a bond of that magnitude and the others will not accept real estate
*08:26.760- 08:32.480* :  as collateral. Mr. Trump had previously asked the court to be allowed to post a hundred million
*08:32.480- 08:38.900* :  dollar bond while he appeals against the judgment, but that was rejected. Prosecutors argued that there
*08:38.900- 08:44.500* :  was a significant risk that without a full bond, Mr. Trump would attempt to evade enforcement of
*08:44.500- 08:50.180* :  the judgment after an appeal. If he is not granted a pause and truly does not have the cash to
*08:50.180- 08:55.700* :  secure a bond, then the Attorney General Letitia James could potentially ask the judge to start
*08:55.700- 08:58.420* :  seizing his assets. Nettael Freak
*08:59.080- 09:04.820* :  Banks are not famous for their generosity, so you can imagine the surprise and delight of people
*09:04.820- 09:10.240* :  in Ethiopia when cash points started allowing them to withdraw huge sums of money more than they
*09:10.240- 09:15.640* :  had in their accounts. Ethiopia's largest commercial bank lost more than 40 million dollars. It
*09:15.640- 09:20.760* :  blamed eight systems glitch and is trying to get the money back. Calcutan Yebeltown in the Ethiopian
*09:20.760- 09:26.280* :  capital Addis Ababa has the story. Well, it happened late into the night and early in the morning,
*09:26.280- 09:32.280* :  so what we understand is at that time after we're a get out that the cash machines are giving
*09:32.280- 09:36.580* :  this money. People were calling each other out on their phones and texting on different
*09:36.580- 09:43.300* :  messaging apps and they were forming these long queues and they were withdrawing large amounts
*09:43.300- 09:49.760* :  of money. At one point, we were told in a university campus the students were getting so much
*09:49.760- 09:54.880* :  money until police arrived in the area and stopped them. And do we know what caused this?
*09:55.780- 10:01.880* :  Well, details are sketchy. First, the assumption was there was some sort of a cyber attack or
*10:01.880- 10:07.060* :  hacking to bridge the system, but at the central bank they said that there was no cyber attack.
*10:07.060- 10:12.240* :  There was no hacking. It was a system glitch that happened during maintenance. It lasted for hours
*10:12.240- 10:16.100* :  during that time. It seems that they have lost quite a large number of money.
*10:16.420- 10:20.820* :  Yeah, I mean, will the bank be able to get that money back and what might happen to those who've
*10:20.820- 10:25.960* :  taken it? The they said that they have formed a task for us in that getting this money. Most of
*10:25.960- 10:31.020* :  this incidents happened in different university towns and the university campuses, so the universities
*10:31.020- 10:35.960* :  themselves were posting this notices saying that anyone in the university that took the money out
*10:35.960- 10:41.540* :  should return it voluntarily. The banks president earlier today gave a statement saying that anyone
*10:41.540- 10:46.780* :  who's returning the money voluntarily will not be charged, but it's not clear how much that
*10:46.780- 10:52.040* :  will be successful and there were reports that they were trying to freeze some of the accounts in
*10:52.040- 10:57.500* :  which these transactions were made. Yeah, quite embarrassing for the bank. What are people
*10:57.500- 11:02.360* :  there saying about it all? It's been the story of the day. It's been all over social media and
*11:02.620- 11:08.280* :  many people have been talking about it and the bank first was rather reserved. They were just
*11:08.280- 11:14.260* :  simply apologizing for any service entrapment that may have occurred in their attempts to control
*11:14.260- 11:20.740* :  this, but later on they admitted that there was indeed withdrawal of or transfer of money, so
*11:20.740- 11:25.960* :  it seems that they're trying to control the narrative and as well as trying to return the money.
*11:26.320- 11:28.400* :  How good, Ann, you both are in Addis Ababa.
*11:29.400- 11:34.980* :  Uruguay already generates some 90% of its power from renewable sources. Now it's looking to make
*11:34.980- 11:41.380* :  green hydrogen for use as fuel using renewable methods, but a severe drought and concerns about
*11:41.380- 11:46.400* :  water supplies have sparked a pushback from Montevideo Grace Livingston reports.
*11:47.160- 11:53.300* :  I'm in a wind farm in southern Uruguay. Next to an enormous wind turbine, you can hear the blades
*11:53.300- 12:01.860* :  slicing the air above my head. Uruguay produces more than 90% of its electricity from renewable sources
*12:01.860- 12:09.440* :  like wind, and I'm with Martin Bockard who's the president of the Association of Private Electricity
*12:09.440- 12:14.960* :  Generators here in Uruguay. The private sector has really been on this and invested very heavily
*12:14.960- 12:20.200* :  on this. And you were saying that all the private electricity generating companies, they only
*12:20.200- 12:26.000* :  produce renewables, is that right? We started investing in first biomass and after later on with wind.
*12:26.000- 12:34.480* :  Between 2017 and 2020, the proportion of electricity generated from renewable sources reached 97%,
*12:34.480- 12:40.240* :  one of the highest rates in the world. Recently, that figures drop slightly because of a severe
*12:40.240- 12:46.740* :  drought, but Uruguay still generates far more of its electricity from renewables. That puts the
*12:46.740- 12:52.540* :  country in a good position to start producing green hydrogen, the government says. As Uruguay's
*12:52.540- 12:58.100* :  industry and energy minister, Omar Paganini launched the country's ambitious green hydrogen
*12:58.100- 13:03.800* :  plans. He's now foreign minister. Uruguay has a specific niche because of all this biomass
*13:03.800- 13:10.400* :  that is waste from agricultural and forestry that combined with hydrogen can be used to make green
*13:10.400- 13:16.300* :  fuels such as green methanol, green gasoline or diesel or SAF, sustainable aviation fuel.
*13:16.520- 13:21.240* :  Latin America has the largest reserves of fresh water per capita in the world,
*13:21.920- 13:26.940* :  according to the United Nations. So many governments think it makes sense to start exporting
*13:26.940- 13:36.280* :  hydrogen and fuels derived from water. But some people, like Anna-Media Badabossa, are worried
*13:36.280- 13:42.500* :  about the impact on Uruguay's water reserves. She lives in Tambordes, a small rural town in northern
*13:42.500- 13:48.380* :  Uruguay, where the German company EnerTrag plans to build a green hydrogen hub, which will include
*13:48.380- 13:56.220* :  wind and solar farms and a plant producing green hydrogen, a methanol. The water here is very
*13:56.220- 14:02.380* :  pure. It's from a subterranean aquifer. It's a precious local resource. Concerns about water are
*14:02.380- 14:09.260* :  particularly acute because Uruguay suffered a drought so severe last year that the capital city
*14:09.260- 14:17.440* :  ran short of fresh drinking water. Mauricio Cardo has a small farm about 40 kilometers from Tambordes.
*14:17.700- 14:22.760* :  He says his crops suffered from the lack of rain last year. He worries that if water is taken from
*14:22.760- 14:30.900* :  the local aquifer to make green fuels, farmers will run short. We have a well where we get water for
*14:30.900- 14:36.760* :  our own consumption and for the farm, but during the drought the water level fell a lot. We wonder how
*14:36.760- 14:42.160* :  this will affect us in the future if this company intends to extract water. It's not just us it will
*14:42.160- 14:49.360* :  affect, but the whole aquifer and the whole region. I put some of these concerns to EnerTrags
*14:49.360- 14:57.360* :  Griselda Castanino. Uruguay is located on the river plate basin. It is three million square
*14:57.360- 15:03.020* :  kilometers. In Uruguay we have a greater availability of water across the whole national territory.
*15:03.360- 15:08.320* :  The scale of this project is very small compared with the amounts of water used by industry
*15:08.320- 15:13.920* :  or irrigation nationally. Really, this idea that it could cause water shortages, the answer is
*15:13.920- 15:21.940* :  categorically no. Griselda Castanino ending that report from Grace Livingston in Uruguay.
*15:24.640- 15:30.520* :  Still to come on the Global News podcast? It goes through a part where a lion is back can start
*15:30.520- 15:37.080* :  looking at poor, inviting you to tickle its tummy. Could robotic pets help reduce loneliness?
*15:46.440- 15:51.860* :  The U.S. has called for restraint after Pakistan confirmed it had attacked targets inside
*15:51.860- 15:57.800* :  Afghanistan. The Afghan Taliban said Pakistani aircraft had, quote, bombed civilian homes,
*15:58.160- 16:02.500* :  killing eight people. The Pakistani foreign ministry said the airstrikes were aimed at militants
*16:02.500- 16:07.440* :  who'd launched multiple cross-border raids. The incident comes just a few months after Pakistan
*16:07.440- 16:12.880* :  exchanged missile fire with another of its neighbours Iran that the two have now restored diplomatic
*16:12.880- 16:18.320* :  relations. For the details on what happened on the Pakistan Afghan frontier, I spoke to our
*16:18.320- 16:23.120* :  correspondent Caroline Davis. We first got an indication that something had happened when the
*16:23.120- 16:28.280* :  Pakistani Taliban said that there had been this incident overnight. We then heard from the
*16:28.280- 16:32.780* :  spokesperson for the Taliban government in Afghanistan who said yes that there had been
*16:32.780- 16:38.540* :  bombing that started around 3am in two different provinces inside Afghanistan. They said that
*16:38.540- 16:43.760* :  eight people had been killed according to them, five women and three children. In the statement,
*16:43.760- 16:49.560* :  the spokesperson described this as being a reckless action of violation of Afghanistan's territory.
*16:49.560- 16:55.160* :  We have now heard from the foreign ministry here in Pakistan. They say this was an intelligence
*16:55.160- 16:59.980* :  based anti-terrorist operation and the particular group they were targeting they say is responsible
*17:00.420- 17:05.200* :  for multiple different attacks inside Pakistan but most recently there was an attack that happened
*17:05.200- 17:11.320* :  close to the border with Afghanistan. Inside Pakistan, side of the border and seven Pakistani soldiers
*17:11.320- 17:18.080* :  were killed. So that is what Pakistan is connecting this to. And just take us through how bad the
*17:18.080- 17:24.760* :  situation is on that Afghan Pakistan border with the Pakistani authorities blaming militants from
*17:24.760- 17:30.960* :  Afghanistan for many attacks. Yes, so this has been a consistent point of tension that Pakistan
*17:30.960- 17:37.560* :  has consistently accused Afghanistan of harboring militants that then come across from Afghanistan
*17:37.560- 17:42.680* :  into Pakistan's borders carry out attacks or plan them from inside Afghanistan and then able to go
*17:42.680- 17:48.340* :  back across which makes it more difficult for Pakistan to respond. Afghanistan as response has
*17:48.340- 17:53.480* :  said that is not the case they have said that Pakistan should stop blaming it for their own
*17:53.480- 17:57.360* :  problems. We've seen this already sort of spill over on a couple of other different incidents.
*17:57.400- 18:03.100* :  You might remember that late last year Pakistan sent that all Afghans that didn't have the right
*18:03.100- 18:08.680* :  legal documentation to stay in the country would be sent back to Afghanistan that led to outcry
*18:08.680- 18:13.980* :  from a lot of human rights groups who said that legitimate refugees and asylum seekers were being
*18:13.980- 18:18.580* :  sent back to Afghanistan before their claims could be properly assessed and they could be relocated
*18:18.580- 18:23.900* :  somewhere safer. When Pakistan was pushed about why they were doing this officials would talk about
*18:23.900- 18:28.340* :  what they said was security concerns. We've seen different occasions where the border between the
*18:28.340- 18:32.760* :  two has been closed for a period of a few days even up to sort of a week or so. So there's been
*18:32.760- 18:37.220* :  real tension between the two governments and this is just the latest example of it. Caroline
*18:37.220- 18:43.180* :  Davies in the Pakistani capital Islamabad. Well next we bring you two stories from India one about
*18:43.180- 18:49.220* :  attacks on foreign students saying Muslim prayers the other concerning the revoking of visas held
*18:49.220- 18:54.360* :  by government critics. Are they unconnected or do they tell us something about modern India
*18:54.360- 18:59.240* :  under the rule of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Our South Asia regional editor
*18:59.240- 19:04.140* :  Ann Barassan Eti Rajan taught me first about the targeting of Muslim students in Mr Modi's home
*19:04.140- 19:09.720* :  state of Gujarat. In the city of Ahmadabad group of foreign students were praying late in the night
*19:09.720- 19:14.600* :  as you know this is the holy month of Ramadan and then suddenly according to police a group of
*19:14.640- 19:19.860* :  people came into the campus and they said they were not supposed to be praying here they should go
*19:19.860- 19:25.080* :  to a mosque and later on the mob attacked the students and ransacked the rooms their mobile
*19:25.080- 19:30.980* :  phones laptop and vehicles were damaged according to police five people have been arrested but this
*19:30.980- 19:37.380* :  created a widespread outage this is not an isolated incident. A couple of weeks ago in Delhi the
*19:37.380- 19:43.140* :  capital city a police officer was seen kicking Muslim worshipers they were praying on the road
*19:43.660- 19:48.460* :  this is part of this wider pattern that is what many people are questioning. Okay and then let's
*19:48.460- 19:54.900* :  look at those allegations about action taken against critics of Mr Modi's government. India doesn't
*19:54.900- 20:00.400* :  allow dual nationality so what they give is overseas citizen of India status which allows you
*20:00.400- 20:05.700* :  to travel any number of times now according to human rights watch more than a hundred people
*20:05.900- 20:11.300* :  the government has withdrawn the OCI card status this is the special privilege of these people who
*20:11.300- 20:16.860* :  are mostly critical of the government of Mr Modi. Some the government says they were also involved
*20:16.860- 20:22.420* :  in protests outside the Indian embassies and high commissions but there are people who even
*20:22.420- 20:27.760* :  supported the farmers protest in India farmers who were asking for a guaranteed minimum price
*20:27.760- 20:33.320* :  their produce and people who are critical of the government's policies and their special privilege
*20:33.320- 20:39.180* :  they were all taken back which means they cannot go back to India. Now do these apparently separate
*20:39.180- 20:45.000* :  stories say something about India today what the Muslim community leaders would argue is that the
*20:45.000- 20:50.740* :  number of attacks on Muslims were a minority in India even though they are 200 million people
*20:51.080- 20:57.520* :  have increased since Mr Modi took over in 2014 because they point out how the places of worship
*20:57.520- 21:04.240* :  businesses of Muslims being demolished and they say that the government is using the existing law
*21:04.240- 21:10.400* :  to target their community but the BJP they're saying that there is a well organized court system
*21:10.400- 21:15.080* :  where these people can go to the court. On the other hand if you look into the issue of dissent
*21:15.080- 21:20.200* :  and criticism it's not only those who are living abroad but also within the country they talk
*21:20.200- 21:26.080* :  about how the government is uses laws on like sedition and defamation and anti-terror laws to
*21:26.080- 21:31.300* :  silence critics even within the countries but the government of Mr Modi denies these accusations
*21:31.300- 21:36.420* :  and they say that they can always approach the courts and India as a very vibrant media where people
*21:36.420- 21:42.100* :  can take their issues and every day Mr Modi is being criticized. South Asia regional editor
*21:42.100- 21:49.740* :  Anvasan Etir Rajan MPs in the Gambia are voted to revoke a ban on female genital mutilation
*21:49.740- 21:55.320* :  paving the way for the removal of legal protections for girls a claim majority of the national assembly
*21:55.320- 22:01.160* :  voted to overturn the ban the bill will face a final vote in three months time independent MP
*22:01.160- 22:05.800* :  Al Mamed Jibber told the BBC why he'd introduced the bill to revoke the ban.
*22:06.220- 22:11.880* :  This practice has done nothing to any woman's body instead it is a cultural norm it is a religious
*22:11.880- 22:17.680* :  norm and this is something that has been performed since pre-colonial era of to date and people are
*22:17.680- 22:23.500* :  wholeheartedly willing that this practice should be done. Only five of the Gambias 58 lawmakers
*22:23.500- 22:29.120* :  are women and critics say the move is being imposed on girls by men are Afrika regional editor
*22:29.120- 22:36.100* :  Richard Hamilton reports. If the proposed legislation passes the final stages the Gambia will
*22:36.100- 22:43.520* :  become the first nation in the world to roll back protections against FGM. The bill introduced by
*22:43.520- 22:50.540* :  Al Mamed Jibber said it sought to uphold religious purity and safeguard cultural norms and values
*22:51.400- 22:56.420* :  but human rights activists say overturning the ban that was brought in in 2015
*22:56.460- 23:03.320* :  is a step backwards that will undo decades of work to end the practice. Amnesty international
*23:03.520- 23:09.000* :  said it would set a dangerous precedent for women's rights. Richard Hamilton
*23:09.860- 23:15.900* :  Over the weekend thousands of fans created a raucous atmosphere at the short track speed skating
*23:15.900- 23:20.120* :  championships in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It is one of the fastest sports there is with
*23:20.120- 23:26.360* :  competitors hurtling around a tight 111 metre track shoulder to shoulder at almost 50 kilometres
*23:26.360- 23:36.300* :  an hour. Matthew Kenyon was there. Local expectation was huge as the Dutch fans poured into the
*23:36.300- 23:42.920* :  Ohoy Arena skating is massively popular here but it was a frustrating day as a succession of
*23:42.920- 23:49.940* :  racers missed out on hope for gold including Olympic champion Susanna Schulting who fell in the
*23:49.940- 23:55.860* :  final of the women's thousand metres and wasn't able to complete the rerun race. Instead gold
*23:55.860- 24:01.620* :  went to Christen Santos-Criswell of the United States whilst Italy's five-time Olympian and
*24:01.620- 24:08.980* :  multiple medalist Arianna Fontana who began her career way back in 2006 took a very unexpected
*24:08.980- 24:16.580* :  bronze at the end of an exhausting weekend. I heard the whistle when I was like two metres away
*24:16.580- 24:21.800* :  from the line I was like please don't let me do this again we're all tired and whoever had the
*24:21.800- 24:27.600* :  legs at the end was going to win and we were all pretty much the same and we started that way
*24:27.600- 24:32.880* :  we ended that way and I'm still happy with all the races that I've done. How has the sport changed
*24:32.880- 24:38.700* :  in the many years since you started I mean what's the difference now? It is a complete different
*24:38.700- 24:46.120* :  sport the time the way you race the speed the tactics he changed a lot and I'm really glad and
*24:46.120- 24:52.120* :  blessed that I was able to evolve with the sport. There were athletes in Rotterdam from Singapore
*24:52.120- 24:59.140* :  from Hong Kong Mongolia and elsewhere for whom the experience was the thing. Prasual Sharath was
*24:59.140- 25:05.540* :  the only competitor from India a giant in some sports but not in short track speed skating.
*25:06.140- 25:10.560* :  So right now I'm the only guy but I think two weeks ago there was a junior world championship
*25:10.640- 25:15.620* :  there we had another Indian taking part slowly we're growing but definitely in the coming years
*25:16.280- 25:19.360* :  India will also bring a lot of numbers into the world championship when the world comes
*25:19.980- 25:24.780* :  and do you have your eye on the winter Olympics in a couple of years? That's a very far of question
*25:24.780- 25:30.800* :  the coming year in 2025 we have the Asian Winter Games in China so that's what we're trading for
*25:30.800- 25:38.700* :  the Netherlands finally got to the top of the podium the victory in the women's 3,000 meters relay
*25:38.700- 25:44.540* :  races are on the track their teammates skating inside the matching their speed before getting a
*25:44.540- 25:50.080* :  huge shove from behind as they move in to replace them at the changeovers so what's it like out there
*25:50.080- 25:56.120* :  on the ice well Canada's individual 500 meter gold medalist Kim Bhuta was part of their relay
*25:56.120- 26:01.820* :  team as well and she loves it the best short track so you have to protect you have to pass
*26:02.460- 26:06.080* :  you have to give everything for your teammates it's kind of crazy but it's really fun to do
*26:06.080- 26:11.560* :  new nations may be coming through as short track tries to spread its appeal but the winners
*26:11.560- 26:17.120* :  roster had in the end a familiar look to it with China taking three of the four available
*26:17.120- 26:23.660* :  golds rounding off an outstanding weekend for them with victory in the men's relay the last race
*26:23.700- 26:27.760* :  of three days have been thrawling action on the ice in Rotterdam.
*26:28.920- 26:31.740* :  A report by Matthew Kenyon finally
*26:35.000- 26:40.460* :  well if you thought that was a cat you'd be virtually right it is a robo cat and it's hoped it could
*26:40.460- 26:46.400* :  help people feel less lonely the UK's backing a trial to see whether robotic pets can improve the
*26:46.400- 26:51.940* :  well-being of elderly people the BBC's Evan Davis spoke to Lydia Enderby who's been using robo
*26:51.940- 26:58.380* :  pets in a care home since 2018 this is on a cycle at the moment but what it will do is respond to
*26:58.380- 27:03.840* :  touch so as soon as you touch it will start pairing it goes through a part where a lion is back
*27:03.840- 27:08.640* :  can start looking it's poor inviting you to tickle it's tummy you stroked it and that that made
*27:08.640- 27:17.320* :  it hurt yeah you stroke it and it it responds to your touch it's quite sweet is the idea to make
*27:17.320- 27:23.400* :  people feel a little bit less lonely or is it able it is pure company does it work actually what
*27:23.400- 27:29.380* :  actually does yeah we use it mainly on our dementia units and what it can do is distract from
*27:29.380- 27:34.380* :  distress behaviors which you get quite a lot with dementia residents and it's also a very good
*27:34.380- 27:39.460* :  reminiscing tool for those people that have had pets in the past opens conversation and like with
*27:39.460- 27:44.140* :  you it makes people smile yeah you have a lot of people that you find moving into a care home that
*27:44.140- 27:48.220* :  would have to get rid of their pet because the landlord in the care home wouldn't allow that so we do
*27:48.220- 27:53.360* :  promote pets as therapy bringing in as many animals as we possibly can but where that can't happen
*27:53.360- 27:58.080* :  this is where this brings in the massive benefits what it's okay lying on its back that's just
*27:58.080- 28:04.200* :  tickle for me it's asking to be tickled on its stomach is anybody fooled by it yes some people are
*28:04.340- 28:08.920* :  some people say well that's not real but they still have fun interacting with it other people
*28:08.920- 28:13.840* :  will just interact with it as a normal cat what's in the range got three ginger and three gray
*28:15.200- 28:20.780* :  we have two birds and we have two dogs it's very nice to have sitting on a shelf and have birds
*28:20.780- 28:27.500* :  song in it is but you can't stop it well the cat is making quite a lot actually I like the way it
*28:27.500- 28:32.200* :  moves it sort of seems to move its eyes and blink a little bit yep that it's seem to even hear
*28:32.200- 28:36.220* :  what I was saying how far can we take this because you could imagine it doing other things I think
*28:36.220- 28:40.220* :  with the advancement of technology I don't think there is a limit to what you can do with it
*28:40.220- 28:47.220* :  what we make sure is that it doesn't substitute human interaction it's not a baby sister it's
*28:47.220- 28:54.300* :  a tool for us to either distract or to open a conversation or to keep somebody company but the
*28:54.300- 28:59.760* :  technology could go anywhere it could alert to falls it could be far more interactive to touch
*28:59.760- 29:05.640* :  and to speech the people get bored of it as much as people without Simon's dementia get bored of
*29:05.880- 29:10.500* :  things anyway it's not necessarily that it's a cat and it's boring now I've finished with it
*29:10.900- 29:16.980* :  it's a tool that we use every day in different capacities there was it was it was it was it
*29:16.980- 29:21.160* :  was it yeah there was a Woody Allen film called sleepers years ago which in the future somehow
*29:21.160- 29:25.440* :  and there's a robo dot and he asked does it leave batteries all over the place
*29:26.420- 29:29.480* :  least we don't have to clear up but you do have to change the batteries yes and they run
*29:29.480- 29:33.380* :  out quite quickly we do have a lot of batteries and we change them very often
*29:33.960- 29:35.900* :  Lydia end to be talking to Evan Davis
*29:38.840- 29:42.800* :  and that's all from us for now but the global news podcast will be back very soon this
