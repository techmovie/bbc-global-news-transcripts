*01:41.020- 01:45.440* :  And Valerie Sanderson ended the early hours of Tuesday the 12th of March. These are our main
*01:45.440- 01:51.280* :  stories. The US State Department says it's trying to expedite the deployment of a UN-backed
*01:51.280- 01:56.980* :  multinational police force to Haiti, where gang violence is dragging the country into Anarchy.
*01:57.020- 02:03.580* :  Ukraine's president says 2,000 kilometres of defensive fortifications are being constructed to
*02:03.580- 02:13.300* :  counter Russia's advance. Also in this podcast, the notion that a great collector suddenly
*02:13.300- 02:20.280* :  discovers great caches of works of the Russian avant-garde hiding under people's bed and the
*02:20.280- 02:26.200* :  Belorussian forest. It's right up there with the earth is flat. The fake pieces of Russian art
*02:26.200- 02:36.200* :  that have been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The US State Department says it's
*02:36.200- 02:42.180* :  leading efforts to help the deployment of a UN-backed thousand strong multinational police force in
*02:42.180- 02:47.360* :  Haiti, where heavily armed gangs have stepped up a campaign of violence. The State Department
*02:47.360- 02:52.340* :  spokesman Matthew Miller said the US was in contact with the government in Kenya, the country
*02:52.340- 02:57.780* :  which would lead the mission. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is in Kingston in Jamaica
*02:57.780- 03:03.640* :  for an emergency meeting of leaders from Caribbean nations, where a plan to speed up a political
*03:03.640- 03:09.180* :  transition in Haiti is being discussed. The proposal that is on the table that Kerakom has developed
*03:09.180- 03:15.520* :  over the past several days in consultation with Haitian stakeholders and consultation with the
*03:15.520- 03:20.100* :  United States would expedite a political transition through the creation of a broad-based
*03:21.400- 03:25.480* :  presidential college to steer the country toward the deployment of a multinational security
*03:25.480- 03:29.500* :  support mission and free and fair elections. And that's what I expect the Secretary will be
*03:29.500- 03:35.320* :  discussing. Henry Isaacs is a journalist in Porto Prince in Haiti. The gangs have rather
*03:35.320- 03:40.480* :  calmed down in the last few hours. It's very fragile. I think everybody's waiting for what comes out
*03:40.480- 03:48.680* :  of Kingston, but we're running low on gas, on oil, food, water. It's a situation that is becoming
*03:48.680- 03:55.120* :  very difficult. Of course, organizations such as WFP, the UNICEF, are all raising alarms about
*03:55.120- 04:00.780* :  how the situation may aggravate in the coming hours and days. So that's why everybody is
*04:01.080- 04:06.780* :  hopeful for a resolution or some sort of path forward, at least politically, to start and address
*04:06.780- 04:13.020* :  a security situation. But people are also very realistic about the possible outcomes as the
*04:13.020- 04:20.140* :  political situation remains very complicated. It's unclear if they will find one common ground
*04:20.140- 04:26.460* :  to help the country get out of that political void that we're facing right now. Henry Isaacs in
*04:26.460- 04:33.580* :  Haiti. As the conflict in Ukraine grinds on, the president, Velodimir Zelensky, says his country is
*04:33.580- 04:41.340* :  constructing defensive fortifications 2,000 kilometers long and three lines deep. He called it a massive
*04:41.340- 04:45.640* :  task, but said the pace of construction is good. Here's Danny Eberhardt.
*04:45.960- 04:51.620* :  Ukraine, it appears, is adapting its military strategy, following an ineffectual counteroffensive
*04:51.620- 04:56.480* :  last year and then recent losses of territory during sustained Russian offensives.
*04:57.200- 05:03.820* :  Mr Zelensky called shoring up defences a massive task. He spoke on social media of lines 2,000
*05:03.820- 05:08.640* :  kilometers long, but appeared to suggest a much shorter distance to the French broadcaster
*05:08.980- 05:15.340* :  BFMTV. He told it that the situation facing his country's troops was now much better than over
*05:15.340- 05:20.800* :  the last three months, claiming without providing evidence that Russian advances had been halted.
*05:21.680- 05:27.400* :  Danny Eberhardt. The trial of a British hedge fund trade-o, which has been watched closely
*05:27.400- 05:33.720* :  by tax authorities around the world, has opened in Denmark. Sanjay Shah is charged with defrauding
*05:33.720- 05:40.240* :  the Danish treasury out of almost $2 billion by claiming tax refunds on the trading of shares,
*05:40.240- 05:45.940* :  a strategy that's become known as a comex scheme. He denies any wrongdoing. I asked
*05:45.940- 05:50.900* :  our international business correspondent Theo Leggett to tell us more about the man at the center
*05:50.900- 05:55.900* :  of the trial. Well, he's a colourful man, Val. He's a British trader who founded a London-based
*05:55.920- 06:01.400* :  initially hedge fund called Solo Capital. And then he moved to Dubai where he gained a reputation
*06:01.400- 06:07.760* :  for hosting extravagant parties. He led an autism charity that held really high profile fundraising
*06:07.760- 06:13.460* :  events with very much a large of the life character. But he's also been implicated in a massive
*06:13.460- 06:19.700* :  Europe-wide trading scam called comex. And he's on trial in Denmark, accused of defrauding the
*06:19.700- 06:27.000* :  country's government of some $1.8 billion in lost taxes between 2012 and 2015 through this complex
*06:27.000- 06:33.280* :  trading fraud. You see, it's complex. Can you describe it in simple language about what it actually
*06:33.280- 06:37.960* :  means? I'll do my best. It's a tax fraud that initially began in Germany in the early years of
*06:37.960- 06:43.800* :  the century. And it involved shares being sold just before the payment of a dividend. Then those
*06:43.800- 06:48.960* :  shares actually being delivered and the transaction completed just after the dividend payment. And
*06:48.960- 06:54.760* :  this created confusion over who actually owned the shares when the dividend was paid. And the net
*06:54.760- 07:00.440* :  result was that two parties, the buyer and the seller, could both claim a refund on a tax payment
*07:00.440- 07:06.780* :  that had only been made once. And that's the basis of it. And this scam was elaborated. You
*07:06.780- 07:11.380* :  had enormous structures where huge amounts of shares were being traded time and time again
*07:11.900- 07:17.540* :  with the sole purpose of getting multiple tax refunds on a tax that had only been paid once.
*07:17.560- 07:21.840* :  It was prevalent in Germany initially. Then they changed the law there. So it moved through Denmark,
*07:21.840- 07:27.380* :  France, Belgium, Italy and Austria. Much of it was orchestrated from London, although the British
*07:27.380- 07:32.340* :  ex-Jekker wasn't really a victim. And those implicated, they've included US pension funds,
*07:32.340- 07:37.220* :  German banks, international lawyers and many, many others. And it's thought to have cost
*07:37.220- 07:43.120* :  governments across Europe at least 10 billion euros. And this man is not the only one charged over
*07:43.120- 07:48.860* :  this, is he? No, in Denmark, there are I think nine people, US citizens, British citizens who
*07:48.860- 07:54.080* :  are also being investigated. But Sanjay Shah is being portrayed by prosecutors as the kingpin,
*07:54.080- 07:58.840* :  one of the real leaders. He's been attracting all of the focus. And don't forget, Denmark's been
*07:58.840- 08:03.440* :  building up to this for years. It's a very complex subject. This is not the first legal action
*08:03.440- 08:08.540* :  it's taken. It did, for example, try and pursue some 100 financial institutions through London's
*08:08.540- 08:15.040* :  high court for repayment of lost tax. In the case of Mr Shah, he'd been identified by whistle blurs
*08:15.360- 08:20.340* :  as a key figure in the trade. But before he could be tried by Denmark, he needed to be extradited.
*08:20.340- 08:25.500* :  So the next tradition battle eventually, Dubai agreed to him being sent to Denmark. And the case
*08:25.500- 08:30.440* :  against him, of course, by its very nature, is very complex. So we shouldn't be surprised. It's
*08:30.440- 08:36.880* :  taken quite a few years to get to this stage. So this court case is happening in Denmark now. You've
*08:36.880- 08:43.180* :  mentioned other countries involved. Is this worldwide? Is this something lots of nations are going
*08:43.180- 08:48.360* :  to be looking at closely? Well, the fraud was largely perpetrated on European government. So it's
*08:48.360- 08:53.980* :  in Europe that we're seeing the attention of prosecutors on a number of people, many of them in the
*08:53.980- 09:00.420* :  US, some in London. Why I think this case is key is because it's so high profile. And it's a test
*09:00.420- 09:04.960* :  of the legal arguments. Mr Shah says he didn't do anything wrong that the Danes don't understand
*09:04.960- 09:10.900* :  their own tax laws. So arguments of that nature will be tested. If he is successfully prosecuted,
*09:11.200- 09:16.140* :  it will certainly energize other European governments to prosecute more people allegedly involved
*09:16.140- 09:22.100* :  in the comex scam. Theologate. Five skiers who disappeared during a storm in the Swiss
*09:22.100- 09:28.080* :  Alps have been found dead as rescue teams described finding an ugly picture when the bodies were found.
*09:28.900- 09:33.960* :  As we record this podcast, teams are still searching for another person from the group who
*09:33.960- 09:38.900* :  all went missing around Ted Blanche Mountain on Saturday. You know, the Matterhorn Mountain
*09:38.900- 09:44.860* :  that straddles the border between Switzerland and Italy. A Geneva correspondent, Imogen Fokes,
*09:45.000- 09:52.720* :  told me more. We know that they set off from CERMAT on Saturday morning to do a very well-known
*09:53.420- 09:59.680* :  challenging, but fine if you're an experienced ski tourer route from CERMAT to a place called Arola
*10:00.260- 10:05.900* :  up to an altitude of well over three and a half thousand meters. Now I think the weather was
*10:05.900- 10:13.380* :  quite good when they set off, but they were absolutely overwhelmed by weather conditions that
*10:13.380- 10:21.940* :  even the rescue services described as catastrophic with heavy snow and very high winds. We're going
*10:21.940- 10:29.400* :  to hear from Anjan Truffer. He has a head of CERMAT's mountain rescue service and he can tell us
*10:29.400- 10:33.700* :  a bit more about what actually happened. Yeah, that's how much is a voice still available. You can imagine,
*10:33.760- 10:39.520* :  you go skiing and suddenly the weather changes and it becomes bad. You can't see anything anymore
*10:39.520- 10:45.580* :  and then come high winds. You are up there in a so-called white out and you lose orientation
*10:45.580- 10:52.960* :  without the necessary equipment. And Imogen, we understand they try to dig a cave for shelter.
*10:54.020- 11:00.860* :  That's right and in fact Mr Truffer who you heard from there, I actually talked to him last night
*11:00.860- 11:07.440* :  before he was one of the people who actually sadly found the five people dead. He had told me
*11:07.440- 11:16.200* :  then it's a good possibility if they have dug this snow hole then they could survive. This happened
*11:16.200- 11:22.880* :  a few years ago with some German ski tours on the same route and they managed to stay warm by
*11:22.880- 11:30.260* :  digging the snow hole. This time it appears that they tried but weren't able to do it and the
*11:30.260- 11:36.240* :  conditions were, as I said, very, very difficult. Minus 16 but also with winds on top of that
*11:36.260- 11:42.780* :  of up to 100 kilometres an hour so the wind chill factor and they were really very high up
*11:43.140- 11:48.440* :  where things went wrong for them. So what about the chances of finding this missing person alive?
*11:49.560- 11:56.740* :  To be honest, I think the rescue services would say at this point, possibly not very high,
*11:56.740- 12:03.900* :  but you notice they say hope is the last thing that people give up. So a very, very risky
*12:04.060- 12:10.240* :  rescue operation and very still, very challenging condition, still windy, still cold,
*12:10.240- 12:16.900* :  at least the visibility is a little bit better. Imogen folks, it's eight months before the
*12:16.900- 12:23.120* :  presidential election in America and the rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is already
*12:23.420- 12:29.580* :  in full swing. Both men could formally clinch their party's nomination this week and they've
*12:29.580- 12:35.720* :  headed straight for the most marginal state in the country, Georgia. Joe Biden won it last time
*12:35.720- 12:43.400* :  by just 0.3%, that's fewer than 12,000 votes. But that victory in Georgia was due in large part
*12:43.420- 12:50.620* :  to almost 90% of the sizeable African-American community there backing him. Yet there are worrying
*12:50.620- 12:56.820* :  signs for Democrats as support among black voters has shown a significant dip in recent polls.
*13:02.380- 13:06.920* :  Going door to door in this Atlanta suburb, voting rights advocates are testing the mood
*13:07.280- 13:10.300* :  among African-American voters, the upcoming election.
*13:15.820- 13:20.620* :  It's an attitude members of the new Georgia project are trying to combat and they're
*13:20.620- 13:26.180* :  finding frustration with the Democrats on the doorstep. Jacqueline Howard is a local teacher.
*13:26.180- 13:31.600* :  The Republicans, they can say one thing and people will catch on to it, you know, and it is sticks
*13:31.600- 13:39.380* :  and so I want us to have more one-liners. I do want more aggression. 88% of black voters in
*13:39.380- 13:45.600* :  Georgia supported Joe Biden in 2020, but some surveys show that as many as one in four
*13:45.600- 13:52.000* :  could now back Donald Trump. Karen Blair from the new Georgia project says the cost of living
*13:52.000- 13:58.220* :  is a big factor. People do talk about the price of gas, the price of food and we absolutely think
*13:58.220- 14:05.540* :  and demand that more be done from this administration and from the next to address those economic
*14:05.540- 14:14.420* :  concerns that people have. Across town the cascade roller skating rink is a big community venue
*14:14.420- 14:20.200* :  for African-Americans. It's also used at elections for get out the vote organizers.
*14:20.880- 14:26.080* :  The owner, Greg Alexander, says few are excited about a Trump Biden rematch.
*14:26.560- 14:32.360* :  A lot of people in my community kind of feel like we're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Biden
*14:32.360- 14:38.760* :  is a good president, he's not a great president, and a lot of us are concerned about his age.
*14:38.980- 14:45.040* :  Look, I'm not a young guy. That's no secret, but here's the deal. I understand how to get things done
*14:45.040- 14:50.620* :  for the American people. The Biden campaign is sought to address the age issue head on.
*14:51.240- 14:54.580* :  With the first of a number of adverts in the coming weeks.
*14:56.860- 15:00.580* :  Here in Georgia, his focus was squarely on voters of color.
*15:00.720- 15:03.780* :  And we're here to say simple thank you, thank you, thank you.
*15:05.920- 15:10.660* :  2020 was the first time in more than a quarter of a century the Democrats won the
*15:10.660- 15:15.760* :  presidential election year. And with more than a third of Georgia's voters coming from the
*15:15.760- 15:22.760* :  African-American community, Joe Biden knows he needs that support to win and cannot take it for granted.
*15:26.400- 15:31.560* :  70 miles up the road, Donald Trump was making his own pitch to Georgia's black voters.
*15:32.260- 15:39.020* :  Some recent polls have shown him with an overall lead here, despite facing 13 criminal charges
*15:39.020- 15:43.900* :  in the state for alleged attempts to overturn the result in 2020.
*15:52.120- 15:56.960* :  The road to the White House runs straight through battlegrounds like Georgia and a handful
*15:56.960- 16:03.940* :  of other key swing states. Expect to see many more of these head-to-head clashes between the two
*16:03.940- 16:07.120* :  candidates in the coming months. Gary O'Donnell here.
*16:09.840- 16:15.100* :  Still to come. It's an all our interest to protect the quality of the written word and to

*17:39.740- 17:46.860* :  anti-Muslim. The law grants fast-tracked Indian nationality to Hindus and five other minority
*17:46.860- 17:52.400* :  religions who've sought sanctuary in India from three neighbouring countries, but not if they're
*17:52.400- 17:59.360* :  Muslim. The law was passed in 2019, but has been delayed due to protests. A South Asia editor and
*17:59.360- 18:04.680* :  Barassan Etherachen told me more. The Citizenship Amendment Act, which is a very controversial
*18:04.780- 18:13.920* :  legislation that allows Indian nationality to Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Christians,
*18:13.920- 18:20.460* :  and who fled from countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, only these three countries,
*18:21.180- 18:27.220* :  so that they can get the India citizenship. Now, this is controversial because it has excluded
*18:27.220- 18:33.860* :  one of the other religions, Muslims and Islam. So now, that has triggered a lot of anger within
*18:33.860- 18:41.420* :  India, because many people fear this is only a precursor to something more sinister by the Hindu
*18:41.420- 18:46.880* :  nationalist BJP government in Delhi, because then they will introduce the national register for
*18:46.880- 18:53.480* :  citizens that will have an impact on the country's 200 million strong Muslim minority. However,
*18:54.120- 18:59.260* :  the Indian government strongly rejects these allegations and says that these are persecuted
*18:59.700- 19:05.660* :  minorities, these six groups of religious minorities from these three countries, they needed
*19:06.260- 19:11.720* :  protection and that is why we have implemented and we are not taking away citizenship from anyone.
*19:12.380- 19:19.180* :  So, when this act was passed, when the law was passed in 2019, that sparked nationwide protests,
*19:19.180- 19:25.380* :  you know, students, political parties, activists, they joined and during the clashes, about
*19:25.380- 19:30.780* :  a hundred people were killed and hundreds more were injured. So, the government was basically
*19:30.780- 19:36.960* :  extending this law without implementing it, without announcing these rules, what makes them
*19:36.960- 19:43.200* :  eligible to become Indian citizens. Now, just weeks before India's national elections,
*19:43.200- 19:47.520* :  this has been announced, once again, triggering a lot of concerns.
*19:48.040- 19:52.860* :  Well, it's triggering concerns not just in India, but also elsewhere because the United Nations
*19:52.860- 20:00.540* :  is saying this law is discriminatory. When it was passed, there were widespread condemnation
*20:00.540- 20:06.940* :  and criticism from the UN and other human rights groups and it's also many Indian activists
*20:06.940- 20:11.980* :  were pointing out, political parties were pointing out, India is a secular democratic country
*20:12.360- 20:18.180* :  and you cannot have one religion outside saying we are going to give nationality based on religion.
*20:18.700- 20:23.800* :  So, that is not in the constitution. So, this violates constitution and that is why this plan
*20:23.800- 20:31.060* :  has to be shelved and they also point out that this is a broader agenda of making India more
*20:31.060- 20:35.880* :  Hindu-centric and that's why the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is implementing,
*20:35.880- 20:42.000* :  but the government is again flatly rejecting these accusations and insists that it was only to
*20:42.000- 20:46.100* :  give those persecuted religious minorities from these three countries.
*20:46.740- 20:52.860* :  And Barasan, Eferajan, catfishing involves the creation of a fake identity online
*20:52.860- 20:58.880* :  then using the deception usually to mislead a victim into an internet-based romantic relationship
*20:59.300- 21:05.320* :  or to commit financial fraud. Now a man from County Down in Northern Ireland has pleaded guilty
*21:05.320- 21:10.440* :  to the manslaughter of a young girl who killed herself after he blackmailed her online.
*21:10.940- 21:17.820* :  Alexander McCartney, who's 25, has also admitted more than 180 charges relating to the systematic
*21:17.820- 21:23.760* :  online abuse of children using catfishing. A correspondent Jennifer O'Leary has been following
*21:23.760- 21:30.060* :  the case at Belfast Crown Court. Alexander McCartney did not have to leave his home
*21:30.060- 21:37.840* :  in a rural part of Northern Ireland in order to abuse children. His cunning took the form of catfishing
*21:38.300- 21:44.000* :  using a fake identity to trick people into online friendships from malevolent purposes.
*21:44.300- 21:50.420* :  For years he deceived children into sending him sexual images of themselves,
*21:50.460- 21:57.700* :  which he then used to threaten them, saying he would upload their images online if they did not
*21:57.700- 22:07.260* :  do what he asked. He was himself a teenager in 2018 when a girl under the age of 13 took her own
*22:07.260- 22:13.540* :  life after being blackmailed by him. He was only stopped after police in Scotland,
*22:13.540- 22:20.680* :  acting on a report in the same year 2018 that another girl who was 12 was being blackmailed,
*22:20.880- 22:27.820* :  triggered an investigation that uncovered the scale of his activities. Thousands of child abuse
*22:27.820- 22:34.960* :  images were found and devices seized from his home. His manipulation spanned the globe with
*22:34.960- 22:41.000* :  victims identified in both New Zealand and the United States. McCartney has been in custody since
*22:41.000- 22:52.200* :  2019. He previously played a guilty to 185 charges over a period from 2013 to 2019 involving more
*22:52.200- 22:59.280* :  than 60 victims and will be sentenced in May. Jennifer O'Leary, the publisher's association has
*22:59.280- 23:04.320* :  written to the world's biggest tech companies, warning them if they want to use the work of British
*23:04.320- 23:10.880* :  authors to build their large language AI models, then they must pay them. Three American authors
*23:10.880- 23:16.560* :  filed a class action against the Chip Company New Video on Friday, accusing it of using their
*23:16.560- 23:23.520* :  copyrighted books without permission to train its new AI platform. Sarah Montague asked the crime
*23:23.520- 23:29.320* :  writer Val McDermott how she found out her works had been used by artificial intelligence.
*23:29.740- 23:36.540* :  I was sent a link to a website that has been clocking the way that the text that have been used
*23:36.540- 23:43.780* :  in this way and 147 pieces of my work, good thing every one of my published novels, has been used
*23:43.780- 23:50.500* :  to train AI models. Would, for example, I notice it because there would be some phrasing that you
*23:50.500- 23:56.660* :  use that would pop up when I asked a question of of a large language model? Yes, I would, yes,
*23:56.660- 24:01.460* :  you would. I mean, if you asked a large language model to write a Karim Puri story, for example,
*24:01.460- 24:07.240* :  using one of my lead characters, you would have something that was recognizably Karim Puri,
*24:07.700- 24:12.780* :  although it wouldn't be anything like the quality of storytelling I would like to say that I produce.
*24:13.840- 24:19.520* :  What powers do you have? Because it's obviously their increasing number, there are authors in the
*24:19.520- 24:24.900* :  states who have been pursuing this and now, of course, publishing houses here who have been
*24:24.900- 24:29.820* :  getting increasingly vocal. Yeah, I think the only redress we have at this point since the
*24:29.820- 24:34.480* :  tech companies are not particularly willing to engage with meaningful discussions about it,
*24:34.780- 24:38.780* :  is to go down the legal route, which unfortunately will take time and be even more expensive.
*24:39.420- 24:44.420* :  I mean, it's in all our interests to protect the quality of the written word and to protect the
*24:44.420- 24:50.060* :  quality of the imagination, which is ultimately what this is about. You know, my work is the
*24:50.060- 24:55.420* :  product of years of practice, but it's also the product of my imagination, that I have come up
*24:55.420- 25:00.800* :  with stories that nobody else has come up with in quite this way. And I don't see why that should
*25:00.800- 25:09.960* :  be available to be ripped off in this way. Is it too late? I don't know, I hope it isn't too late,
*25:09.960- 25:14.540* :  because I think if we go down this road, hope we will ultimately see as the impoverishment of the
*25:14.540- 25:24.520* :  culture. It will sideline authors who are effectively no longer needed. And thus, ultimately, we end
*25:24.520- 25:28.580* :  up with a much poorer culture. We end up with a much poorer set of imaginative options.
*25:29.460- 25:37.540* :  I think if you put ideas, broad ideas into AI models, what you get are poor replicas at the moment.
*25:37.540- 25:43.200* :  And that will improve, obviously, as the machines learn better from everyone else's work.
*25:43.640- 25:47.120* :  But I would like to think that the human element will be missing.
*25:47.800- 25:53.160* :  Except, isn't this the direction where headed? For example, if they were prepared to pay you,
*25:53.500- 25:55.420* :  wouldn't that solve your particular issue?
*25:57.440- 26:02.520* :  Well, it would solve it on the surface, and at least authors would be being recompensed for the work.
*26:04.020- 26:09.560* :  The route we're going down with AI model is the idea that you no longer have to pay authors to
*26:09.560- 26:13.660* :  produce something in the first place. You just rip off everything that's been done before, feed it
*26:13.660- 26:17.980* :  through the computer, put a different name into it, a different style into it, you know, say something,
*26:18.400- 26:23.540* :  write something in the style of Val McDermard and Ali Smith, and you get something different.
*26:24.160- 26:27.520* :  How serious a moment do you think this is for writers?
*26:28.660- 26:34.800* :  I think it's a very serious moment. If you create a culture where it's no longer economically viable
*26:34.800- 26:38.040* :  for people to be writers, why would they write?
*26:39.020- 26:40.000* :  Are we really at that point?
*26:40.840- 26:45.600* :  I don't want to be a sort of doomsayer, but the bottom line is, if you're not being paid for what
*26:45.600- 26:50.020* :  you do, then you're doing it in the interstices of what you are doing in order to make a living.
*26:50.800- 26:55.740* :  And so you don't have the kind of focus, the kind of practice, the kind of day-to-day learning
*26:55.740- 26:59.600* :  your craft that good writers aspire to.
*27:00.720- 27:08.100* :  The author, Val McDermard, and the BBC contacted OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta for a response,
*27:08.100- 27:14.820* :  but didn't hear back. And finally, more fakes than originals, that's how one expert has
*27:14.820- 27:20.220* :  described the market for Russian art in a new documentary here on the BBC World Service.
*27:20.920- 27:26.080* :  Hunting down an elusive art dealer who began selling paintings in the early 2000s,
*27:26.420- 27:31.620* :  the programme reveals fake pieces of work that have been sold for hundreds of thousands of
*27:31.620- 27:35.120* :  dollars. Gregor Atenesian compiled this report.
*27:40.540- 27:45.980* :  An auction in London in the 1950s, and it's a scramble for an avant-garde Russian masterpiece,
*27:46.600- 27:47.720* :  once banned by Stalin.
*27:52.560- 27:58.620* :  The demand for these radical modern pieces, after World War II, also brought a wave of four Jews,
*27:59.360- 28:06.020* :  and it still fools buyers today. James Butterwick has spent much of his life in Russia and Ukraine
*28:06.060- 28:14.260* :  as an art dealer. He is one of the outspoken few to publicly question the true value of these works,
*28:14.740- 28:18.500* :  including by a Russian-Israeli art dealer called Leonid Zaks.
*28:36.940- 28:42.500* :  Leonid Zaks, one of the Zaks collection which has pieces hanging in European and American museums,
*28:42.500- 28:49.360* :  and in Beatrice Gumpel's home. Her parents bought several pieces from the Zaks collection. Beatrice's
*28:49.360- 28:55.500* :  family was sold a piece supposedly by the Russian master Lysitsky, a heavy way of modern art.
*28:55.780- 29:02.700* :  After he died, when we had the first inheritus meetings, when one of the experts said that a whole
*29:02.700- 29:08.680* :  range of paintings were dubious, we were absolutely shocked and we didn't believe it to start with.
*29:09.120- 29:12.620* :  James looked over the painting carefully. It did not look good.
*29:13.560- 29:19.520* :  So we went to Hephaestus Analytical, a lab which specializes in sporting fakes using AI.
*29:20.500- 29:22.400* :  Then his myself is its founder.
*29:22.900- 29:27.960* :  On the simplified graph, it's quite clear that the magenta line representing the subject painting
*29:27.960- 29:36.700* :  is really far away from the expected distribution of what we'd expect from a authentic Lysitsky.
*29:40.880- 29:46.660* :  This was backed up by more traditional scientific analysis that found modern fibers within the paint.
*29:48.940- 29:51.820* :  But what about the man behind the collection Leonid Zaks?
*29:52.200- 29:57.260* :  I spent months tracking him down across Europe and the Middle East. The trail went cold
*29:58.240- 30:05.780* :  until finally out of the blue he wanted to talk. I asked Mr. Zaks where he got his paintings from.
*30:08.860- 30:13.960* :  He told me his late mother had given him the paintings and insisted they were genuine
*30:14.420- 30:16.880* :  and he had no reason to question their provenance.
*30:17.840- 30:21.720* :  Beatrice now has her answer. The family's painting is worthless.
*30:22.660- 30:29.040* :  Gregor Atenetian and you can hear the full documentary on the BBC World Service YouTube page.
