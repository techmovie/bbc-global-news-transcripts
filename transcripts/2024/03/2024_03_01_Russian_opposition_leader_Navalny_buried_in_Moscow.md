*03:04.600- 03:11.060* :  in finding a curse and a grave digger and delays in handing over his body after the funeral

*03:23.500- 03:29.200* :  his life for my children for their future I can't speak calmly now because I don't even know if
*03:29.200- 03:34.520* :  the loss of a personal relative will cause me greater emotions than I feel now this is impossible
*03:34.520- 03:42.080* :  to survive a very difficult loss for me the man whom we came to see off today did so much for
*03:42.080- 03:47.840* :  everyone around me that I think it would simply be wrong not to come we came here because unfortunately
*03:47.840- 03:56.780* :  that's all we can do today this is our civic position I came here to honor the memory of Alexey
*03:56.780- 04:03.060* :  Navalny he was one of our best citizens this is a man who defended freedom he fought corruption
*04:03.520- 04:08.000* :  and did much more for our country than the current government's doing and we will appreciate that
*04:08.000- 04:15.360* :  with time I Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford was watching there were those extraordinary
*04:15.360- 04:20.700* :  scenes first of all inside the church itself that open coffin novella's mother beside it you
*04:20.700- 04:26.060* :  know a man who was obviously so vibrant so charismatic so dynamic in life seeing him there in that
*04:26.060- 04:29.860* :  open coffin was really quite a moment I think for many Russians and obviously for all of those
*04:29.860- 04:34.880* :  people who are gathered there to support Alexey Navalny and to show their support for him right
*04:34.880- 04:38.940* :  now and they've been throwing flowers in front of the hearse as it's been making its final journey
*04:39.520- 04:45.160* :  towards the cemetery there are flowers on the front on the bonnet of the car striking that
*04:45.160- 04:49.960* :  of course those perhaps closest to Alexey Navalny were not there his wife his widow now was not
*04:49.960- 04:53.900* :  there his children were not there they're all living in exile for their safety she has posted
*04:53.900- 04:59.620* :  Juliana van la has posted a comment on Twitter talking about 26 years of utter happiness and
*04:59.620- 05:04.600* :  thanking Alexey Navalny for that but you know this was a funeral that was banished to a distant
*05:04.600- 05:09.480* :  suburb of Moscow Marino is where Alexey Navalny used to live you know it's not the city center this
*05:09.480- 05:14.400* :  is not a mass gathering right by the Kremlin and that was deliberate but of course even though they
*05:14.400- 05:18.780* :  forced people to the outskirts many many people did turn up and they've been shouting things not
*05:18.780- 05:24.580* :  just Navalny's name which in itself is significant but no to war they've been shouting Putin is a killer
*05:24.760- 05:29.460* :  which is of course what his family claim happens to him and they've been shouting freedom to political
*05:29.460- 05:34.480* :  prisoners so it has become an act of politics as well and banished though it may have been to
*05:34.480- 05:41.460* :  outer Moscow it did happen despite a heavy police presence there was a demonstration of solidarity
*05:42.660- 05:46.180* :  yes and bear in mind this might not have happened in the sense that there was such pressure on
*05:46.180- 05:50.960* :  Alexey Navalny's mother at the beginning when he died they were not handing over his body for nine
*05:50.960- 05:55.840* :  days so this entire process has been fought with difficulty right up to the moment of Alexey Navalny's
*05:56.120- 06:01.440* :  coffin arriving in that church that service inside and now the burial taking place and I mean
*06:02.100- 06:05.980* :  I can't be there many people can't be there but the videos that are coming from there suggest that
*06:05.980- 06:11.300* :  he's being buried to the tune from his favourite film Terminator 2 and apparently Sonata has been
*06:11.300- 06:16.800* :  played as well so a man iconoclastic and very unusual in life now being buried in a very unusual
*06:16.800- 06:23.740* :  way too Sarah Reinsford talking to Johnny Diamond and the Czech Shahz√© Defer in Moscow who attended
*06:23.740- 06:29.240* :  the funeral said it showed that ordinary people are not indifferent to what is happening in Russia
*06:29.240- 06:35.400* :  it is a silent but clear message of disapproval of the situation in Russia the extent of the
*06:35.400- 06:42.280* :  security measures confirms the Russian regime is afraid of its own citizens France and Germany
*06:42.280- 06:46.720* :  have added their voices to calls for a full investigation into the deaths of Palestinians waiting
*06:46.720- 06:52.080* :  for aid in northern Gaza Israeli troops opened fire as people scrambled for food supplies
*06:52.080- 06:56.920* :  the Hamas run territories health ministry said more than 110 people were killed
*06:56.920- 07:02.260* :  Yolanda Nell reports from Jerusalem there have been international expressions of shock
*07:02.260- 07:07.160* :  over the events in Gaza that led to dozens of Palestinians being killed while trying to secure
*07:07.160- 07:12.140* :  aid for their hungry families many countries have demanded a full explanation from Israel
*07:12.140- 07:18.240* :  Francis president Emmanuel Macron called for truth and justice while the UN Secretary General Antonio
*07:18.240- 07:23.880* :  Guterres said an independent investigation would be required Palestinian witnesses and officials
*07:23.880- 07:29.780* :  said Israeli forces opened fire on the crowds Israel says its soldiers used only warning shots
*07:29.780- 07:35.520* :  to drive people back as aid lorries were being looted it says most victims were trampled or run
*07:35.520- 07:41.060* :  over at the same time as the latest events of highlighted the depth of the humanitarian crisis in
*07:41.060- 07:47.560* :  Gaza while fighting continues a senior Hamas official has warned they could derail the latest ceasefire
*07:47.560- 07:54.320* :  talks Yolanda Nell Iran's last parliamentary election four years ago had the lowest turnout since
*07:54.320- 08:00.460* :  the revolution but a possible boycott could mean today's poll proves even less popular following
*08:00.460- 08:06.540* :  the anti-Hijab protests over the death in police custody of Masa Amine in 2022 people are unhappy
*08:06.540- 08:13.520* :  at the lack of social and political freedoms and Iran's dire economy many moderate candidates have
*08:13.520- 08:18.020* :  been disqualified so the hard line clerics are expected to maintain their grip on power
*08:18.600- 08:22.220* :  Baran Abasi of the BBC Persian Service is following developments in Iran
*08:22.980- 08:29.140* :  there are no credible independent polling in Iran that it can refer to but some state agencies
*08:29.660- 08:36.720* :  have conducted some polling which would turn out between 30 and 40 percent which would be the
*08:36.720- 08:41.920* :  lowest turnout in the history of the Islamic Republic since its establishment 45 years ago
*08:42.380- 08:47.260* :  large number of candidates have been disqualified from running in their elections almost
*08:47.640- 08:52.860* :  all reformists a large number of independence and even centuries conservatives have not been allowed
*08:52.860- 08:58.060* :  to run yeah as you say the moderates even a moderate former president shut out but it is
*08:58.060- 09:04.980* :  a quite important vote the assembly of experts could well decide who is Iran's next supreme leader
*09:05.440- 09:09.960* :  exactly there are two elections being held in Iran at the moment one parliamentary elections and
*09:09.960- 09:15.840* :  one assembly of experts that is tasked with choosing the next leader figure that holds an absolute
*09:15.840- 09:23.340* :  power in Iran and the current leader Ali Khamenei is 84 and the assembly of experts has
*09:23.340- 09:29.560* :  of 80 terms so it is what he expected that the incoming assembly of experts would be the one
*09:29.560- 09:35.800* :  that would choose the next leader and the assembly of experts has 88 seats only 144 candidates
*09:35.800- 09:41.420* :  have been allowed to run in their elections even the sitting member and former president Hassan
*09:41.420- 09:45.720* :  Rouhani has been banned and it seems that the leader the current leader is trying to
*09:45.720- 09:52.300* :  only allow his most ardent supporters into that assembly and what is the mood of people in Iran
*09:52.300- 09:58.220* :  after those protests were eventually put down a large number of people have boycotted the vote as I
*09:58.220- 10:03.620* :  said the Iranian people are grappling with the and ailing economy a crushed protest movement
*10:03.620- 10:09.700* :  and also massive corruption amongst the Iranian officials as well as distrust in the regime they
*10:09.700- 10:14.880* :  have lost hope that they can bring about meaningful changes through the ballot box.
*10:18.820- 10:23.740* :  India has retained its title as the world's fastest growing major economy with figures for
*10:23.740- 10:30.460* :  the final three months of 2023 showing it expanded at 8.4%. That is good news for the Prime Minister
*10:30.460- 10:36.200* :  Narendra Modi ahead of the general election this year he seems well on course to win a recent
*10:36.200- 10:43.180* :  poll on global leaders put his approval rating at a whopping 78 percent but after 10 years in
*10:43.180- 10:48.140* :  office how has he managed to be so popular our South Asia correspondent Samira Hussein has been
*10:48.140- 10:56.920* :  finding out. The man who's driving the very important centerpiece of the entire BJP project has
*10:56.920- 11:02.460* :  been the use of media. Sima Chisti is the editor of the wire an online news publication in India
*11:02.500- 11:07.500* :  mainstream media whose job is to whole government's questionable is not happening so Mr. Modi
*11:07.500- 11:14.320* :  stands tall the cult is allowed to build up because you have 500 news channels you have 60 websites
*11:14.320- 11:22.700* :  all saying the same thing. I take a trip to India's agricultural heartlands I want to find out
*11:22.700- 11:31.480* :  about government programs that give out money and rations. The welfare schemes have been so popular
*11:31.480- 11:37.820* :  and so beneficial that some farmers like Sanjay whose fields I'm currently walking through
*11:38.240- 11:46.160* :  well he's now switched his allegiance. I was a congress supporter but then Narendra Modi came
*11:46.160- 11:51.980* :  with his ideologies his way of working and the way he connects to the people on the ground he
*11:51.980- 11:58.080* :  understands people's way of thinking and what they want now I vote for the people. When people
*11:58.080- 12:02.580* :  are voting straight either in the name of Mr. Modi or against him. Prashankashore is a political
*12:02.580- 12:08.600* :  strategist and he has worked with many political parties including the BJP. A lot of schemes that
*12:08.600- 12:14.340* :  used to be schemes run by government departments are all now being presented and repackaged
*12:14.760- 12:20.160* :  Pradhan Mantri so everything Pradhan Mantri meaning prime minister so everything coming not from
*12:20.160- 12:23.860* :  the government not from any other person it's all coming from Pradhan Mantri.
*12:26.760- 12:31.540* :  Marching through the streets of Varanasi the right-wing Hindu nationalist organization known
*12:31.540- 12:38.140* :  as the Rashtriya Swamsavik, Sung or RSS seen as the ideological fountainhead for the ruling party.
*12:39.180- 12:45.580* :  The RSS is entrenched in families it's a deeply conservative inward looking militia which was founded
*12:45.580- 12:53.120* :  in 1925 which Mr. Modi and his party pays obeisance to. Mr. Modi doesn't just respect the RSS
*12:53.120- 13:01.460* :  he became a member in his teens and it's that brand of Hindu nationalism that was behind the
*13:01.460- 13:08.280* :  demolition of the 16th century mosque three decades earlier where the Ram temple now sits inaugurated
*13:08.280- 13:13.660* :  by the prime minister of a secular country who made it an election promise to bring the Lord
*13:13.660- 13:21.960* :  Ram back to his birthplace in Ayodhya. Now a court in Mr. Modi's home constituency ruled Hindus can
*13:21.960- 13:28.440* :  worship in the basement of the Gyanvapi mosque. The local Muslim community is fearful for their
*13:28.440- 13:36.680* :  place in the Rundra Modi's India. I'm angry I'm frustrated there is pain because we are not
*13:36.680- 13:42.600* :  able to do anything we have been praying there for 50 years but we can't do anything to save it
*13:43.060- 13:48.780* :  I don't understand is this the way our country will run and for how long will you suppress us?
*13:48.880- 13:57.260* :  Modi's embrace of Hindu nationalism and his energetic projection of himself as a strong leader
*13:57.640- 14:01.800* :  have alarmed minorities but will still likely win him a third term.
*14:03.800- 14:10.580* :  The report from India by Samira has seen. Unlike their land-based relatives sea slugs are renowned
*14:10.580- 14:16.180* :  for their variety and beauty but like many creatures it seems they are affected by global warming
*14:16.460- 14:21.080* :  scientists say they've discovered a new species in British waters that would be more at home
*14:21.080- 14:25.780* :  in Spanish seas. Rick Edwards spoke to Ross Bullymor from the Centre for Environment,
*14:25.780- 14:31.520* :  Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. How do we make a discovery like this with new species sounds
*14:31.520- 14:37.280* :  really simple but it's kind of not to downplay it but it's simply a case of recognising something
*14:37.280- 14:42.060* :  that's popped up in front of you doesn't look normal and that was exactly the case myself and
*14:42.060- 14:47.280* :  colleagues on a routine fish dock assessment survey sorting through the fish and our eye focus
*14:47.280- 14:52.020* :  on everything else that lives on the seabed around the fish spotted some of these little creatures
*14:52.020- 14:56.600* :  and I say little they're between two and five centimetres and yet just recognised that something
*14:56.600- 15:01.600* :  wasn't quite right and that kicked off a whole chain of events that spanned the last good few
*15:01.600- 15:07.200* :  years we first really questioned this one in 2018 so it's taken a fair amount of time and in that
*15:07.200- 15:12.180* :  time we had to set up a whole new partnership with the university in Cadiz in Spain to actually
*15:12.180- 15:17.900* :  track down exactly what this little creature is and yeah whether it is new to science or not and it
*15:17.900- 15:22.880* :  was so it's kind of related to ones that would usually be found in the med but it is different right
*15:23.060- 15:28.120* :  absolutely so within a couple of hours really I'm looking at this thing myself and a colleague had
*15:28.120- 15:33.820* :  narrowed it down to looking like an example of a group of species most known from southern Spain
*15:33.820- 15:38.760* :  the Mediterranean etc and of course that sets off alarm bells in your heads that you know are we
*15:38.760- 15:42.560* :  really seeing what we think we're seeing and as I say that kicked off that whole chain of events
*15:42.560- 15:46.840* :  of contacting the next expert that knows a little bit more than you of that type of species to
*15:46.840- 15:53.000* :  try and get confirmation do we have any idea why they might have ended up here in colder waters
*15:53.840- 15:59.520* :  in all honesty for this particular species not yet is the key answer but the critical thing is
*15:59.520- 16:04.060* :  because we've been able to give it a name because we've been able now to publish a description of
*16:04.060- 16:09.480* :  the species that opens the door to being able to start to piece together the story of this species
*16:09.480- 16:14.720* :  where it is how long it's been there what it's doing what I can say is you know when we're talking
*16:14.720- 16:20.400* :  about sea slugs we have had absolutely definite confirmed records in the last few years of
*16:20.400- 16:27.020* :  known water species coming into UK waters now that's a safer bet to start to say that's likely
*16:27.020- 16:33.400* :  an indication of changes as a consequence climate change this particular species the story is
*16:33.400- 16:38.400* :  just beginning and so with these sea slugs I think I'm right in saying that they are interestingly
*16:38.400- 16:43.800* :  in their sort of bit of the food chain they're like the apex predator aren't they absolutely so you
*16:43.800- 16:48.900* :  know we've got a massive diversity of sea slugs in the UK over a hundred species and you know a lot
*16:48.900- 16:53.520* :  of them are absolutely tiny some do get up to you know between five and ten centimeters maybe a
*16:53.520- 16:58.320* :  bit more but the majority of them are tiny but as you say they're performing a crucial role in
*16:58.320- 17:03.380* :  the ecosystem as top predators they're doing amazing things recycling biotoxins and things like
*17:03.380- 17:08.680* :  that from their prey to defend themselves to stop them becoming prey and they're really specific
*17:08.680- 17:14.340* :  to the animals that they feed on so as a top predator and being so specific they're a really
*17:14.340- 17:19.200* :  important creature for us a scientist to be able to look at because their presence or absence can
*17:19.200- 17:23.520* :  indicate you know bigger changes that are going on in the ecosystem rustbullet more
*17:27.080- 17:33.340* :  still to come on the global news podcast it is a necessity to radically invite them in with
*17:33.340- 17:39.860* :  initiatives that say you're invited specifically you the row over a play about slavery that will
*17:39.860- 17:51.340* :  be shown on some nights to black theatre go as only as we mark international women's day
*17:51.340- 17:56.560* :  discover two podcasts from the BBC World Service celebrating women around the world
*17:56.820- 18:01.100* :  where to be a woman is the brand new podcast exploring in which countries women are living
*18:01.100- 18:07.180* :  their best lives and my award-winning podcast dear daughter is back for season three join me

*19:45.020- 19:49.520* :  a new report in the medical journal the Lancet the researchers worked out the figure by examining
*19:49.520- 19:55.220* :  the height and weight of more than two hundred million people it means obesity has overtaken

*20:11.480- 20:17.100* :  and some of the transitioning countries like mexico like satafika and the chile are the ones
*20:17.100- 20:22.180* :  that now have the highest rates of obesity we got the details about the study from our global
*20:22.180- 20:28.520* :  health correspondent smita mundizad the researchers say they've been looking for the last 30 years
*20:28.520- 20:35.120* :  at this data and they've been really surprised at the speed at which things have changed back 30
*20:35.120- 20:39.320* :  years ago people were really worried about countries where people being underweight was the major
*20:39.320- 20:43.580* :  problem and now they don't forget about the people who are underweight particularly in the
*20:43.580- 20:49.800* :  poorer communities but obesity is becoming a huge problem in some nations in some island nations
*20:49.800- 20:56.580* :  for example seventy to eighty percent of the adult population are classed as a beast that is a
*20:56.580- 21:03.260* :  huge proportion and why has it become such an issue now in the island nations the researchers
*21:03.260- 21:08.340* :  pointed to the fact that there's been this aggressive marketing of unhealthy food and you compare
*21:09.060- 21:13.960* :  to the availability of healthy food at a price that people can actually manage to get it
*21:14.540- 21:18.800* :  but it's not just the island nations the united states is there in the top 10 for example and
*21:18.800- 21:24.000* :  Egypt to makes it into the top 10 they're saying it really is about this balance between how
*21:24.000- 21:31.120* :  easy it is how cheap it is for people to get nutritious healthy food compared to how easy it is
*21:31.120- 21:36.080* :  to get the unhealthy food but it's not just an individual's problem it's the government's problems
*21:36.080- 21:41.520* :  it's the health agencies problems and the director general of the world health organization said
*21:41.520- 21:46.420* :  it's also about the private sector that they've really got to take responsibility and be accountable
*21:46.420- 21:52.840* :  for the effects that their products are having yeah and those effects are likely to be long term
*21:52.840- 21:58.440* :  take us through some of the health issues facing the world's population it's becoming more and more

*22:16.500- 22:22.420* :  so many different ways and also it can increase the chance of certain cancers so health officials
*22:22.420- 22:27.240* :  are saying we have got to tackle this problem our global health correspondents meet a man
*22:27.240- 22:32.040* :  decide on the podcast this time yesterday you may have heard our report about the young doctors
*22:32.040- 22:36.700* :  going on strike in South Korea well today the authorities there have raided the headquarters
*22:36.700- 22:41.840* :  of the Korean Medical Association following that mass walk out Celia Hutton reports
*22:42.660- 22:47.740* :  the raid was carried out in the offices of the Korean Medical Association in Seoul and other
*22:47.740- 22:53.260* :  locations outside the capital the association has accused the government of using intimidation
*22:53.260- 23:00.020* :  tactics to force nearly 10,000 doctors back to work they're protesting against government plans
*23:00.020- 23:06.940* :  to sharply increase the number of medical school places in South Korea it's illegal for doctors
*23:06.940- 23:12.280* :  to strike and the authorities say those who failed to return to work by Thursday's deadline
*23:12.780- 23:16.820* :  are now at risk of losing their licenses and face criminal prosecution
*23:16.860- 23:24.100* :  Celia Hutton a Ukrainian man selling a poison thought to be linked to at least 130 deaths in the UK
*23:24.100- 23:31.200* :  has been identified by the BBC Leonid Zakutenko advertised his services online promoting suicide
*23:31.200- 23:35.360* :  he told an undercover reporter he sent weekly parcels to the UK
*23:35.360- 23:41.140* :  Angus Crawford has the details we've found that this man Leonid Zakutenko has been in effect
*23:41.140- 23:47.320* :  selling what is really a suicide kit and he's been doing it for years now we've known about him
*23:47.320- 23:52.400* :  for a couple of years but after the war in Ukraine began we thought potentially he would have to
*23:52.400- 23:57.020* :  cease trading and it would be impossible to confront him but we did know that then he'd been
*23:57.020- 24:03.380* :  advertising on what is an effect of pro suicide website and then his details have been shared
*24:03.380- 24:09.160* :  globally and he was sending out this chemical globally and what really made us look at him again
*24:09.180- 24:14.440* :  was the arrest of a man called Kenneth Law last year in Canada you may remember the story
*24:14.440- 24:21.420* :  he was supplying the same chemical and he faces now 14 murder charges so we decided to contact
*24:21.420- 24:27.520* :  Zakutenko again and undercover reporter contacted him and we found that he was claiming to be sending
*24:27.520- 24:35.440* :  five parcels of this poison to the UK every single week so he travelled here we confronted him
*24:35.760- 24:40.720* :  he of course denied that he was sending this chemical at all the authorities have known about
*24:40.720- 24:46.220* :  the pro suicide forum about this substance even about this seller four years we know that the
*24:46.220- 24:53.920* :  first coroner's report about this substance about this website was in September 2020 and a first
*24:53.920- 25:01.140* :  parcel from Zakutenko is intercepted by police in November 2020 as well so the problem is it feels
*25:01.140- 25:05.820* :  like very little is being done despite the knowledge there may be a lack of joined up thinking
*25:05.820- 25:11.600* :  in ad acquies in the inadequacies in the poison's act it's not a priority but we also know really
*25:11.600- 25:17.120* :  disturbingly that the police do sometimes make welfare checks to people who buy this substance
*25:17.620- 25:23.360* :  but often leave the chemical there and we do know that in several incidents people have then
*25:23.360- 25:30.140* :  gone on to end their own lives anger scrawford a theatre in London has caused controversy by
*25:30.140- 25:35.380* :  announcing plans to hold some shows for black audiences only the UK government said the idea
*25:35.380- 25:42.320* :  was wrong and divisive slave play which was a hit on Broadway is set on a southern US plantation
*25:42.320- 25:48.220* :  and stars Kit Harrington from the tv series Game of Thrones the producers say two nights of its run
*25:48.220- 25:53.380* :  this summer will be aimed at an all black identifying audience Stephanie Prentice has been following
*25:53.380- 25:59.980* :  the story this is a play that's been described as the most radical Broadway play in years it's
*26:00.040- 26:05.900* :  certainly the most totally nominated 12th in total it's creator Jeremy R. Harris he says it was
*26:05.900- 26:13.100* :  written to dissect the wounds and unhield scars of slavery and in his words show how far we haven't
*26:13.100- 26:17.980* :  come we'll be hearing more from him shortly but first the premise is three interracial couples
*26:17.980- 26:23.420* :  attending sex therapy and without giving too much weight slavery plays into their dynamics
*26:24.140- 26:30.840* :  now that concept generated ray reviews also fears criticism alongside that this fresh criticism
*26:30.840- 26:37.000* :  now of the idea to have performances in London's west end just for people who identify as black
*26:37.760- 26:42.980* :  now it's worth noting the company have done this before in New York it's called a blackout concept
*26:42.980- 26:48.400* :  but it coming to London it's generated a public response and it has caused the government to respond
*26:49.120- 26:53.580* :  so Prime Minister Rissisunak's team they said they're now looking into it to get more of an idea
*26:53.580- 26:58.620* :  of how this could play out but they've said that restricting audiences on the basis of rays would
*26:58.620- 27:04.140* :  be wrong and divisive on what do the creators of the play say about this particular issue
*27:05.160- 27:10.580* :  well the justification given for this concept online on the booking website is that blackout shows
*27:10.580- 27:15.820* :  that that's what they call them are intended for black audiences to experience art in a way that's
*27:15.900- 27:21.500* :  free from what it called the white gaze and the shows creator Jeremy Harris he spoke to the BBC
*27:21.500- 27:28.600* :  about why there are a litany of places in all of our countries that are generally inhabited by
*27:28.600- 27:34.660* :  only white people and no one has questions about that the idea of a blackout night is to say
*27:34.660- 27:39.980* :  this is a night that we are specifically inviting black people to fill up the space to feel safe
*27:39.980- 27:43.640* :  with a lot of other black people in a place where they often do not feel safe
*27:44.580- 27:50.400* :  so elsewhere in the interview he calls this radically inviting people into a space saying it's
*27:50.400- 27:55.860* :  necessary to open up the arts and it plays into other issues he also sees within the theater world
*27:55.860- 28:00.660* :  he speaks about including lower-income people who might feel excluded as well from the theatre
*28:01.340- 28:06.740* :  now the plays UK producers they responded to the criticism saying the blackout concept
*28:06.740- 28:11.660* :  it's been handed down from the plays Broadway one so they said they're carefully considering
*28:11.660- 28:17.000* :  how to incorporate it but they were clear they said that no one will be prevented from attending
*28:17.000- 28:24.000* :  any performance Stephanie Prentice talking to Nigel Adley the workplace has changed a lot for many
*28:24.000- 28:29.320* :  of us in the past couple of years phrases like quiet quitting or lazy girl job have been appearing
*28:29.320- 28:34.900* :  on social media as people re-evaluate what they want from their work lives and their free time
*28:34.900- 28:41.300* :  as Claire Williamson reports good morning this is your daily reminder that being mediocre is not
*28:41.300- 28:47.540* :  always a bad thing here's how you can get a lazy girl job today i always encourage you to think
*28:47.540- 28:52.020* :  outside of the traditional career box because the old methods are long gone the future of your career
*28:52.020- 28:56.660* :  success is staying adaptable to new career strategies the new year is upon us there's no more room
*28:56.660- 29:02.340* :  for outfits the case for not always striving for perfection and prioritizing other things apart
*29:02.340- 29:08.680* :  from work has only grown since the pandemic gap real judge from Colorado became a tiktok sensation
*29:08.680- 29:17.820* :  in 2023 with the hashtag lazy girl job that's had 43 million views i started in the tech industry
*29:17.820- 29:22.700* :  that's where i come from that's what my degree is in and so i grabbed the you know the dream job the
*29:22.700- 29:26.700* :  one that you know your parents are really proud of everyone's super excited that you have it you
*29:26.700- 29:31.780* :  know great benefits things like that and what i truly learned after a year and a half of being
*29:31.780- 29:36.920* :  there that doing good work just meant more work and maybe not getting paid correctly and so i
*29:36.920- 29:41.480* :  started to rethink everything and so that's where my lazy girl job ethos like really started i just
*29:41.480- 29:46.880* :  didn't have this like you know cutesy marketing term for it yet my name is Jamie Ducharm and i
*29:46.880- 29:52.660* :  am a health correspondent at time magazine last year Jamie wrote an eye catching article entitled
*29:52.660- 29:59.360* :  the case for mediocrity about why we could benefit from not taking work so seriously it was
*29:59.360- 30:05.420* :  something i had been thinking about for several years at that point really starting in 2020 a year
*30:05.420- 30:10.860* :  where i think a lot of people were re-evaluating various aspects of their lives i was also writing a
*30:10.860- 30:17.340* :  book at that time and you know for many writers and journalists writing a book is this huge goal and
*30:17.340- 30:23.640* :  it was for me it was outwardly the most impressive thing i had accomplished in my career up to that point
*30:24.280- 30:30.680* :  but i was also not doing great mentally i was worried about the book all the time i wasn't sleeping
*30:30.720- 30:36.740* :  well i was anxious and that's when i really started to think about the role that i wanted work to play
*30:36.740- 30:42.180* :  in my life and and what mediocrity meant and how it could actually potentially be a good thing
*30:42.960- 30:49.280* :  mediocre means ordinary or average which in a work context is usually quite negative and they're not
*30:49.280- 30:55.200* :  really words i dissociate with Jamie i don't think it has to mean that you're kind of not trying
*30:55.200- 31:00.900* :  all that hard and mailing it in and and just kind of doing subpar work what it means to me is doing
*31:00.900- 31:08.080* :  the things that i've decided are important well but not pushing myself to do this next thing just
*31:08.120- 31:13.260* :  because it will look impressive or to constantly feel as though i have to be moving up and these
*31:13.260- 31:18.760* :  attitudes are being felt by employers as i found out at a recent women in business lunch where i
*31:18.760- 31:26.140* :  met margo who runs a number of hair salons across london there is a big change in employees routine
*31:26.140- 31:32.560* :  i believe in the fact that they really want to focus on their mental health and their freedom so
*31:32.560- 31:40.260* :  there is a trend regarding the way they want to work and i will say that many people want to work
*31:40.260- 31:47.260* :  part-time now to make sure they have time for other things much of this resonates with what i heard
*31:47.260- 31:53.040* :  from Gabrielle judge and Jamie Duchamp who are taking control over the way they work but that's not
*31:53.040- 31:59.220* :  always an option there is certainly a degree of privilege in being able to to outwardly say i'm
*31:59.220- 32:03.820* :  going to take my foot off the gas a little or in saying that i'm going to try a little bit less
*32:03.820- 32:10.180* :  hard i understand that this is a privileged position to take i think the closest bit of criticism
*32:10.180- 32:15.860* :  that i got to that point was a teacher who wrote to me and said i loved what you wrote i agree with
*32:15.860- 32:21.100* :  all of it but i don't see a way that i can implement that in my work essentially being mediocre
*32:21.860- 32:26.860* :  it is not an option if you want to be a good teacher Jamie Duchamp ending that report by Claire
*32:26.860- 32:35.340* :  Williamson and that is more or less all from us for now but before we go here's Jackie with
