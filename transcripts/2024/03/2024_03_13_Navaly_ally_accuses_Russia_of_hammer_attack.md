*01:00.220- 01:08.560* :  BBC World Service. I'm Andrew Peechner at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday the 13th of March. These are
*01:08.560- 01:14.340* :  our main stories. An ally of Alexei Navalny accuses Vladimir Putin of ordering a hammer attack.
*01:14.340- 01:19.900* :  Listen, it was a pleasure to read everything you wrote to me. It's double pleasure to read this
*01:19.900- 01:25.540* :  and realize that I'm still alive. The Russian election in occupied Ukraine. What kind of an
*01:25.540- 01:30.680* :  election is it when there are two locals one holding a list of voters and the other a ballot box
*01:30.680- 01:35.680* :  and a military man with a machine gun. And reports from another mass kidnapping in Nigeria.
*01:35.680- 01:42.840* :  Also in this podcast the sound of a coral reef. We've been listening to recordings from different
*01:42.840- 01:47.600* :  reefs and we've noticed these healthy reefs seem to have really distinct acoustic signatures
*01:47.660- 01:57.960* :  that differ from what we see on highly degraded or impact. Let's start this podcast in Lithuania
*01:57.960- 02:03.120* :  where the president has accused Russia of a pre-planned assault. After one of its citizens, a close
*02:03.120- 02:08.040* :  aid to the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was attacked with a meat hammer outside
*02:08.040- 02:13.100* :  his home in Vilnius. Leonid Volkov has been speaking for the first time since being discharged
*02:13.100- 02:18.220* :  from hospital looking pretty battered at his home in the Lithuanian capital with his arm and a
*02:18.220- 02:28.540* :  sling. He said the attack was a greeting from Putin. Hello friends, I'm home. Thank you very much
*02:28.540- 02:35.280* :  for your words of support. It's hard. It's okay. We can handle it. Listen, it was a pleasure to read
*02:35.400- 02:40.760* :  everything you wrote to me and it's a double pleasure to read this and realize that I'm still alive.
*02:41.300- 02:45.760* :  They wanted to talk me with a meat hammer and men right outside my house in the yard
*02:46.180- 02:51.680* :  attacked me and hit me in the leg 15 times. It's obvious that this was such an obvious
*02:51.680- 02:58.000* :  typical characteristic gangster greeting from Putin, from gangster St. Petersburg, Vladimir
*02:58.000- 03:02.900* :  Vladimirovich, greetings to you. What does can I say? Something it's to be done, right?
*03:04.720- 03:07.980* :  I heard more from our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Ramesford.
*03:08.460- 03:14.000* :  Leonid Volkov is a very close associate of Alexey Navalny, who of course died in prison in
*03:14.000- 03:19.680* :  Russia a few weeks ago. Last month, Volkov was his chief of staff. For many years, he's a very
*03:19.680- 03:26.560* :  close friend. He was an absolutely instrumental part of the Navalny team who are the vast majority
*03:26.560- 03:32.000* :  of them now living in exile, many of them in Lithuania. In fact, Leonid Volkov moved some years
*03:32.000- 03:37.760* :  ago. For his own safety, he was facing a number of politically motivated criminal charges in Russia.
*03:38.280- 03:44.320* :  He had been working from Lithuania primarily to make sure that the Navalny team as a whole could
*03:44.460- 03:48.320* :  carry on doing their work, their anti-corruption investigations, and their opposition activity
*03:49.380- 03:53.700* :  when it was becoming more and more difficult in Russia. As the conditions in Russia became impossible
*03:53.700- 03:58.940* :  for activists, because Navalny's team was declared extremist and banned more and more activists
*03:58.940- 04:05.180* :  from that team then moved to Lithuania to join their headquarters in exile in Vilnius.
*04:05.240- 04:08.440* :  So I think this will be particularly shocking for them, because of course they
*04:08.840- 04:14.340* :  moved to Lithuania to be safe, and this looks like they can't guarantee that safety. So it was a
*04:14.340- 04:18.800* :  pretty vicious attack, but he has said that he will continue his activism, so will the whole
*04:18.800- 04:23.560* :  team. They won't surrender, which of course is a catchphrase from Alexey Navalny himself.
*04:23.880- 04:28.340* :  Is there any opposition at all left? Alexey Navalny's team is pretty much entirely
*04:28.340- 04:34.060* :  outside Russia now. Inside Russia, it's extremely difficult. There are three candidates in theory
*04:34.060- 04:38.580* :  on the ballot paper for Sunday's election other than Vladimir Putin, but none of them are
*04:38.580- 04:44.060* :  genuine opposition characters, and in fact some of them openly support Vladimir Putin. So in that
*04:44.060- 04:50.520* :  sense, no, the main opposition parties have all been sidelined over the years, and all vocal
*04:50.520- 04:55.480* :  opposition has been crushed in the last two and a half decades of Vladimir Putin's rule. So it's
*04:55.960- 04:59.960* :  basically dangerous to be an open political opposition to Vladimir Putin today. Some people
*04:59.960- 05:04.920* :  do still try. There was a couple of candidates who tried to be genuine opposition candidates
*05:05.380- 05:09.700* :  in the presidential election, but their path was predictably blocked, and they weren't able to
*05:09.700- 05:14.840* :  register the electoral commission intervened and said that their signatures of support were not
*05:14.840- 05:19.400* :  genuine, and therefore they weren't registered. So it's difficult, it's dangerous, and as you can
*05:19.400- 05:24.600* :  see, it's even dangerous outside Russia itself. Sarah Rainesford with me from Warsaw. The attack
*05:24.600- 05:29.320* :  on Mr. Volkov came just days before Russia's presidential election. Mr. Putin, of course,
*05:29.320- 05:34.200* :  is nailed on to win, but even so, Moscow will try to make the results as credible as possible.
*05:34.680- 05:39.240* :  Not just with a large turnout in Russia itself, but also by pressuring voters in parts of
*05:39.240- 05:44.360* :  occupied Ukraine, where polling is already underway. Here's Vitaly Shevchenko.
*05:50.680- 05:55.740* :  Let me tell you about Russia, my friend. It says a song playing at a polling station in the
*05:55.740- 06:01.800* :  occupied part of Ukraine's Herzogn region. And this election says a lot about Russia under
*06:01.800- 06:06.860* :  Vladimir Putin. He is certain to win, he's firmly in control of the electoral system,
*06:06.860- 06:13.960* :  and all of his most outspoken critics are in jail, exiled, or dead. A high turnout would help
*06:13.960- 06:19.780* :  the Kremlin's efforts to legitimize Putin's continued rule and justify the war in Ukraine.
*06:20.600- 06:25.040* :  There's a variety of ways in which Ukrainians under occupation are being coerced
*06:25.040- 06:31.740* :  into voting. First, they're visited at home by pro-vote campaigners, often accompanied by armed
*06:31.740- 06:37.540* :  men. Then, even though polling stations exist, they're not required to visit them, as the
*06:37.540- 06:42.580* :  occupation authorities are also dispatching people with ballad boxes to their homes. This is how
*06:48.780- 06:53.040* :  such visits work. This is voting at home. Get your passport and come out here.
*06:53.400- 06:58.600* :  Ukrainians have already come under considerable pressure to adopt Russian passports,
*06:58.600- 07:04.260* :  but Ukrainian passports are accepted as proof of ID to make voting even easier.
*07:04.540- 07:08.660* :  Residents have been sent text messages informing them of the dates of the vote,
*07:08.660- 07:14.840* :  and tried and tested Soviet methods are also being deployed to attract them to polling stations,
*07:15.420- 07:18.180* :  such as the offer of free concerts and food.
*07:25.040- 07:29.540* :  One resident of Kherson region, the south-eastern part of which is occupied by Russian forces,
*07:30.100- 07:37.060* :  described to the BBC how voting was organized in his village. We are unable to disclose his name
*07:37.060- 07:42.440* :  or location due to security concerns, and his words are read by someone else.
*07:42.940- 07:48.220* :  Pro-Russian locals visit households with ballad boxes accompanied by armed military men.
*07:48.780- 07:52.760* :  If they knock in no one opens, they move on to the next house. This is ridiculous.
*07:53.320- 07:58.080* :  What kind of an election is it when there are two locals, one holding a list of voters and
*07:58.080- 08:04.300* :  the other a ballad box and a military man with a machine gun? This isn't democracy, it is a comedy show.
*08:05.040- 08:11.140* :  Ukraine has dismissed the vote as an illegitimate sham, and those involved in organizing it
*08:11.140- 08:16.660* :  have been targeted. For example, on the 6th of March, a local woman helping the Russian
*08:16.660- 08:22.120* :  administration hold the election, died in a car bombing in the occupied town of Beredansk
*08:22.360- 08:26.500* :  in Zaporizhia region. I asked the regions of Ukraine and Governor Ivan Fedorov,
*08:26.720- 08:31.980* :  who was responsible for their attack. Some heroes, great cooperation between our resident
*08:31.980- 08:39.140* :  insight and public by Tertors and our secret services and special services on Tertiary of Ukraine.
*08:39.740- 08:46.360* :  Most see this poll as just an endorsement of Vladimir Putin and his efforts to annex these regions.
*08:46.660- 08:50.560* :  And if you do not support him, you should stay quiet or leave.
*08:51.880- 08:57.060* :  Now Russia has reported another wave of drone attacks by Ukraine. The Kremlin's defence
*08:57.060- 09:02.360* :  ministry says it shot down 58 drones overnight across six regions in Russia that were some reported
*09:02.360- 09:07.400* :  injuries. The Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said this was in retaliation for Russian
*09:07.400- 09:12.060* :  attacks on his country. Key of back forces have warned residents of the border regions with
*09:12.060- 09:16.380* :  Russia to evacuate. I spoke to our Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse.
*09:16.960- 09:22.120* :  It's the second time in as many days that Ukraine has launched a fairly large scale
*09:22.300- 09:28.580* :  series of drone attacks on Russia. We've spoken to sources at the country's security service,
*09:28.680- 09:36.940* :  who say the aim in targeting three oil refineries on the border with Ukraine was to target Russia's
*09:36.940- 09:43.580* :  economy, essentially its ability to make money from energy and fund its continued invasion of
*09:43.920- 09:49.180* :  Ukraine. Now, President Zelensky may frame this politically as revenge for the air strikes
*09:49.180- 09:56.000* :  his country constantly endures at the hands of Russia. But it's clear when you look at what the
*09:56.000- 10:00.460* :  Russian officials are acknowledging that there was damage in at least two of these oil refineries,
*10:00.960- 10:06.660* :  which include some of the biggest plants in the country. It seems that these drones have left
*10:06.680- 10:13.680* :  a mark. In addition to that, we're told by Russian officials in the city of Belgorod close to the
*10:13.680- 10:21.100* :  border that the FSB, the Federal Security Service HQ, was also targeted by a drone. I think as far
*10:21.100- 10:26.600* :  as Ukraine is concerned, it will be almost satisfied with what is going on. As far as Vladimir Putin
*10:26.600- 10:32.380* :  of Russia is concerned, in a recent interview with the state TV, he's accused of Ukraine of trying
*10:32.460- 10:39.100* :  to interfere with the upcoming presidential elections. As we speak, there are also pro-Ukrainian
*10:39.100- 10:43.680* :  Russian military groups, which have made an incursion, who claim to still be fighting in a village
*10:43.680- 10:49.520* :  there. So Russia certainly has a headache on its own territory whilst continuing to try and
*10:49.520- 10:53.800* :  occupy as much of Ukraine as possible. A lot of focus in recent days on these border areas. I'm
*10:53.800- 11:00.440* :  just seeing flashing up on the news wires that civilians have been told to leave these areas on
*11:00.440- 11:07.320* :  the border between Ukraine and Russia. Yes, and this is part of the almost psychological objective
*11:07.320- 11:13.700* :  that Ukraine hopes to achieve, because it is manufacturing its own drones. Yes, that is
*11:13.700- 11:18.660* :  something it has been looking to develop, but it is unable to, when you look at what Russia
*11:18.660- 11:23.660* :  inflicts on Ukraine, but it can then sometimes launch more than 150 drones and missiles in one
*11:23.660- 11:29.420* :  go to overwhelm air defenses. This is Ukraine trying to apply psychological pressure to the Russians
*11:29.420- 11:34.340* :  that can, you know, live their lives and turn a blind eye to what is going on across the border.
*11:34.340- 11:39.460* :  So that will feed into that as well for Kiev, no doubt. James Waterhouse with me from Kiev.
*11:40.260- 11:46.900* :  They are the three best-known stripes in design history, but Adidas has reported more annual losses.
*11:47.380- 11:52.020* :  The German sportswear giant reported a drop in profits after sales were hit by their decision
*11:52.060- 11:57.160* :  to stop working with the rapper Kanye West and his easy brand. Here's Jessica Wilkins.
*12:04.200- 12:08.720* :  Sportswear brand Adidas has run into trouble, posting another drop in its annual profits.
*12:09.300- 12:16.100* :  The loss of $82 million followed a profit of $668 million for Adidas the previous year.
*12:23.300- 12:27.160* :  Sales were hit by the brand's decision to cut ties with the rapper Kanye West.
*12:27.260- 12:33.800* :  After he made anti-Semitic comments on social media, his tweets also got him suspended
*12:33.800- 12:40.500* :  from Instagram and X. At the time, Adidas, a German company which profited under the Nazis,
*12:41.260- 12:46.820* :  said it had to face up to its historic responsibilities and ended its partnership with Mr. West.
*12:47.940- 12:53.540* :  This has hit sales in the United States, where Mr. West's easy trainers were particularly popular.
*12:54.660- 12:59.200* :  Easy trainers were estimated to bring in $2 billion every year for Adidas.
*13:00.360- 13:04.260* :  The sports brand is still selling its remaining inventory of easy trainers.
*13:13.000- 13:17.900* :  Now there are a few more powerful symbols of ecological devastation than degraded or
*13:17.900- 13:24.460* :  disappearing coral reefs. A paper for the Royal Society Open Science Journal made an astonishing
*13:24.540- 13:30.500* :  discovery. Coral reefs have their own soundscapes, an active acoustic environment.
*13:39.120- 13:44.420* :  And there's more. If you play the sounds of healthy coral reefs to unhealthy coral reefs,
*13:44.460- 13:50.120* :  it helps them repair things. Nadege Aoki from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
*13:50.120- 13:56.260* :  Tomacolic Amorage, and why coral reefs matter? Coral reefs provide habitat for more than
*13:56.740- 14:02.540* :  quarter of all marine species. So they're huge hubs of biodiversity and they're also really
*14:02.540- 14:08.400* :  important to human communities because of their structure. So reefs actually when there are
*14:08.820- 14:14.500* :  powerful storm surges or waves, a lot of that energy is absorbed by the 3D structure of the
*14:14.500- 14:20.780* :  reefs and they help to protect our coastal communities. What kinds of sounds are on healthy coral
*14:20.780- 14:25.200* :  reefs? And how did you find out that unhealthy ones were listening to different sounds?
*14:25.800- 14:31.400* :  So a healthy reef is going to have a lot of different types of sound on it and the ones that we
*14:31.400- 14:37.700* :  think are really important are these biological sounds produced by fishes and invertebrates primarily.
*14:37.700- 14:44.480* :  We know this because we've been listening to coral reefs in my laboratory group about 10 years
*14:44.480- 14:49.660* :  now. We've been listening to recordings from different reefs and we've noticed these healthy
*14:49.660- 14:55.320* :  reefs seem to have really distinct acoustic signatures that differ from what we see on highly
*14:55.320- 15:00.560* :  degraded or impacted reefs. Fascinating, it's so interesting. So what happened when you put a
*15:00.560- 15:06.160* :  speaker on a reef and start to play back recordings from other healthy reefs?
*15:06.440- 15:12.660* :  So what we were able to observe by putting that speaker down and actually having it play sound
*15:12.660- 15:21.460* :  in the vicinity of a larval corals by playing underwater sounds to those larvae on a degraded
*15:21.460- 15:27.760* :  reef that didn't have those natural sound cues, we were able to induce that settlement behavior
*15:28.260- 15:33.120* :  at much higher rates than we were observing naturally without the sound enrichment.
*15:33.580- 15:36.260* :  What's going on there? Why are they responding to the sound? Is it because
*15:37.900- 15:42.800* :  anthropomorphized this at all? Which is obviously the danger, but what is it about the sounds
*15:42.800- 15:48.720* :  it's inducing them to settle and to re-produce? So I'll say we really don't know yet. This is such a
*15:48.720- 15:55.180* :  behavior that we're only just now characterizing in corals. We do observe this in other marine species
*15:55.180- 16:01.480* :  in larval fishes, larval oysters. So sound is a really important sensory cue for a lot of these
*16:01.480- 16:06.960* :  animals and it's likely indicating to them something about the environment or the habitat that is
*16:07.020- 16:14.320* :  positive for them. And the hope in the long term is that this is part of efforts to restore coral
*16:14.320- 16:18.660* :  reefs, but obviously not the whole solution because the whole solution would involve fundamentally
*16:18.660- 16:23.720* :  not changing their environment with warmer oceans and so on. Yes exactly. I think what we're really
*16:23.720- 16:29.280* :  trying to do is give these baby corals kind of the best shot and the best head start at
*16:30.180- 16:35.200* :  getting a foothold back on these reefs and helping them to recover on their own. But if we are not
*16:35.200- 16:41.800* :  able to stop the rise of marine heatwaves, of overfishing, of all of these other things that are
*16:41.800- 16:48.560* :  really impacting reefs, obviously there's not a lot else that we can do to prevent them from
*16:48.560- 16:56.260* :  continuing to downside. Still to come on this podcast. They are the biggest organisms on earth. So
*16:56.260- 17:02.480* :  there's some of the oldest organisms on earth. So we hold them in a regard of kind of exotic species.
*17:03.060- 17:06.060* :  Our giant redwood trees are flourishing in the UK.
*17:12.120- 17:16.520* :  It all started with me asking my friends and family to write letters to my daughter Coco,
*17:16.520- 17:22.440* :  sharing their experiences and giving her advice for her life ahead. The idea blossomed into
*17:22.440- 17:27.640* :  dear daughter from the BBC World Service. The podcast where, with the help of your letters,
*17:28.080- 17:32.020* :  I'm creating a handbook to life full of advice for daughters everywhere.
*17:33.000- 17:37.520* :  Listen now by searching for dear daughter wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:42.480- 17:47.200* :  New figures from the United Nations suggest child mortality is at a historic low.
*17:47.680- 17:51.780* :  Despite progress, it's estimated that nearly five million children die before their
*17:51.780- 17:54.480* :  fifth birthday somewhere in the world every year.
*17:55.060- 17:59.520* :  Billy Caprani from the UN Children's Agency UNICEF was involved in compiling the study
*17:59.740- 18:04.020* :  and she's been talking to James Coppnot. I wouldn't say that that's caused for celebration,
*18:04.020- 18:09.920* :  4.9 million children dying before they reach their fifth birthday is still an unacceptable tragedy,
*18:09.920- 18:14.680* :  but it does mean that we're starting to make progress in the right direction. And quite often,
*18:14.680- 18:22.160* :  these are children dying of entirely preventable causes. Basic healthcare systems like having
*18:22.160- 18:28.220* :  a skilled birth attendant, a trained midwife at the birth of a baby can make all the difference
*18:28.220- 18:34.560* :  in saving lives or just having the most basic access to things like oral rehydration
*18:34.560- 18:41.080* :  salts if a baby gets diarrhea or having antibiotics if they have an infection, but too many babies
*18:41.080- 18:45.460* :  and moms are missing out and having those basic things and they're still dying on
*18:45.460- 18:50.000* :  necessarily every year. So whether it has been progress, what are the
*18:50.000- 18:55.860* :  principal fields that you see it coming in? Well, there's been progress across the world.
*18:55.860- 19:01.940* :  There is good news over the course of the last generation. We've seen a huge drop in the number
*19:01.940- 19:07.120* :  of babies, especially very young babies dying unnecessarily in their first few days and weeks of
*19:08.100- 19:13.240* :  life, but progress hasn't been even around the world. Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa,
*19:13.240- 19:19.000* :  in particular, where there are communities very low income households where mothers are not
*19:19.000- 19:23.980* :  receiving even the most basic access to healthcare or any care when they're pregnant.
*19:24.380- 19:29.800* :  It sounds then that economics financing funding is one of the key issues here. And so if
*19:30.520- 19:37.020* :  almost 5 million babies still are dying before or children below the age of five are still dying,
*19:37.740- 19:43.020* :  that would suggest that perhaps this issue doesn't have the sort of global level of interest
*19:43.020- 19:48.880* :  it should. Well, it's true that money can make a difference in in terms of making sure that
*19:49.360- 19:53.760* :  healthcare workers have the drugs they need, the vaccines they need, all the basic equipment,
*19:53.760- 20:00.660* :  but actually the way to deliver the life-saving basic treatment that a pregnant mom needs or a
*20:00.660- 20:06.960* :  newborn baby needs is often through a community healthcare worker that is not an expensive thing to
*20:07.140- 20:12.200* :  provide. There are a couple of examples of countries that have made huge progress just in the
*20:12.200- 20:18.260* :  last few years. Places like Malawi and Rwanda have shown just what you can achieve when you get
*20:18.260- 20:24.780* :  organised and have a community healthcare worker system locally so that those moms are getting
*20:24.780- 20:30.960* :  attention early on. And it hasn't been through enormous injections of cash so much as organising
*20:30.960- 20:35.980* :  the health system around this community healthcare workforce and it's managed to bring down the
*20:35.980- 20:42.900* :  number of babies dying by more than 75 percent. Really amazing, it shows just what can be done when
*20:43.380- 20:48.140* :  when we really focus in on the issue and make use the evidence about what we know will work.
*20:48.140- 20:54.120* :  Lily Caprani from UNICEF. Just days after more than 250 children were abducted from a
*20:54.120- 20:59.100* :  school in Northwest Nigeria. There are reports that dozens of people have been kidnapped from a
*20:59.100- 21:04.600* :  village in the same state, Kaduna. Chris Awakor is in Abuja, the Nigerian capital and gave me this
*21:04.600- 21:11.500* :  update. The abductors invaded a community surrounded some homes and went from house to house
*21:12.040- 21:18.400* :  picking family members. Some of them were working up because it was around midnight and most of
*21:18.400- 21:23.580* :  them because of the prevailing heat in Nigeria were not really properly dressed. They had very few
*21:23.580- 21:31.080* :  clothes on and they were led like that into the bush. A family member has stood us that at least
*21:31.080- 21:37.760* :  six members of his family were abducted and at the moment the authorities haven't said anything
*21:37.760- 21:44.660* :  about it but it adds to the green concerns over the security situation not just in Kaduna state
*21:44.660- 21:51.360* :  but across the country as concerns grow over the whereabouts of the nearly 300 school children
*21:51.360- 21:56.060* :  that were abducted until the last week. Well other kidnappings as well that have happened in
*21:56.060- 22:02.660* :  Nigeria as we were talking about on Saturday. Exactly and enough is to Nigeria there was this incident of
*22:03.400- 22:10.180* :  some IDPs internally displaced persons who were kidnapped nearly 200, nearly 200 of them,
*22:10.620- 22:18.460* :  mostly women and girls who were abducted by suspected Boko Haram fighters. The government
*22:18.460- 22:24.360* :  hasn't said if they've discovered their location at the moment. That was the first mass
*22:24.360- 22:31.160* :  abduction before that of the Kurega school children and then just days after that there was also the
*22:31.160- 22:39.740* :  incident of the abduction of about 15 students from a school an Islamic school in Sokoto state also
*22:39.740- 22:46.700* :  in northwest Nigeria and these are actually adding to a growing concerns and safety of people
*22:47.280- 22:53.040* :  not just in the north of the country but across Nigeria. Many people are wondering why this
*22:53.040- 23:00.900* :  mass abduction you know growing and continuing and how large numbers of people could be kidnapped
*23:00.900- 23:07.460* :  and led into the bush without being detected by security forces. Chris O'Walker in Abuja it's
*23:07.500- 23:13.200* :  the first rematch since 1956 President Joe Biden former President Donald Trump have sealed their
*23:13.200- 23:18.400* :  party's nominations for November's US election. Both candidates secured the support of enough
*23:18.400- 23:23.080* :  delegates in primary contests in several states on Tuesday Sarah Smith reports.
*23:23.820- 23:29.780* :  America is set for a repeat of the 2020 election as both Joe Biden and Donald Trump have now secured
*23:29.780- 23:35.040* :  enough votes to each claim their party's presidential nomination. Mr Biden said he was honoured that
*23:35.040- 23:39.800* :  Democrats had put their faith in him at a moment when the threat to the nation posed by Mr Trump
*23:39.800- 23:45.220* :  is greater than ever. The president had faced minimal opposition from other candidates even though
*23:45.220- 23:50.780* :  many in his own party do worry about his age and his electability. Donald Trump's domination of
*23:50.780- 23:56.620* :  the Republican party has been confirmed that he's won every state primary so far except for one in
*23:56.620- 24:02.760* :  Vermont. Admiring the biggest trees on the planet the giant redwoods is a staple for any tourist
*24:02.760- 24:08.160* :  in California. Now they're thriving in the UK at least according to a new survey. Here's our
*24:08.160- 24:15.040* :  science editor Rebecca Morrell. Giant redwoods were brought to the UK 160 years ago they were the
*24:15.040- 24:20.580* :  ultimate botanical status symbol for the Victorians. Now a new study suggests the UK's damp
*24:20.580- 24:25.620* :  mild weather suits them and they're flourishing there. It's estimated there are half a million of
*24:25.620- 24:30.960* :  these giants towering above the treetops in the UK. Professor Matt Disney from University College
*24:30.960- 24:36.480* :  London is one of the new studies authors. They are the biggest organisms on earth so there's some
*24:36.480- 24:43.940* :  of the oldest organisms on earth so we hold them in a regard of kind of exotic species and so they've
*24:43.940- 24:49.500* :  been planted all over the place. Sometimes in perhaps not such sensible places but it means you see
*24:49.500- 24:55.760* :  them cropping up in the backs of houses and churches and streets and parks and people are planting
*24:55.760- 25:01.140* :  more of them. The UK trees outnumber the redwoods in their native range in California where there are
*25:01.140- 25:06.860* :  fewer than 80,000 trees and they're also at risk from climate change. But the trees in the UK aren't
*25:06.860- 25:12.280* :  yet as tall as their American counterparts. In California they can grow to 90 metres. In Britain
*25:12.280- 25:18.260* :  the tallest is just shy of 55 metres but that's because in terms of age the trees are still very
*25:18.260- 25:23.740* :  young. It's thought giant redwoods can live for more than 2,000 years so there's still plenty of
*25:23.740- 25:30.400* :  time for the UK's trees to reach even heavier heights. The BBC has secured rare access to a tiny
*25:30.400- 25:35.460* :  village in the heart of the demilitarized zone, the strip of land separating North and South
*25:35.460- 25:41.220* :  Korea. There a small community of South Koreans live within metres of the North meaning they must
*25:41.220- 25:46.180* :  be guarded day and night by hundreds of soldiers. The village was established at the end of the
*25:46.180- 25:52.040* :  Korean War as a symbol of peace but 70 years on the peninsula is still divided and in the past year
*25:52.040- 25:58.040* :  tensions between the North and South have fled. As hopes of reunification fade the village's days
*25:58.040- 26:03.920* :  seem numbered. As all correspondent Jean McKenzie spent three days with the US-led coalition army
*26:03.920- 26:12.520* :  that runs the village. At 85 years old Mrs Kim still tends to her fields. She's checking her
*26:12.520- 26:20.300* :  cabbages which she'll eventually turn into kimchi. One day I was picking up eight corns over there
*26:20.300- 26:28.280* :  and I saw North Korean soldiers. I started screaming. It was so scary. Do you pay much attention
*26:28.280- 26:36.880* :  to whether relations between North and South Korea are good or bad? No, we leave with our backs
*26:36.880- 26:43.640* :  to each other so I don't think about it much. But the residents have once again found themselves on
*26:43.640- 26:49.540* :  the front line of escalating tensions between the North and South. Earlier this year Kim Jong-un said
*26:49.540- 26:55.440* :  the peaceful reunification of the two countries was no longer possible and branded South Korea his
*26:55.440- 27:04.140* :  number one enemy. We've walked 10 minutes now out of Tae-sung through the countryside to one of
*27:04.140- 27:10.220* :  the fields on the ferry outskirts right up next to the North Korean border where one of the residents
*27:10.220- 27:15.920* :  is harvesting the end of his rice. He has to be accompanied by two heavily armed soldiers with
*27:15.920- 27:20.900* :  machine guns. They are dressed entirely in camouflage even their faces are covered.
*27:24.500- 27:30.500* :  From here the mayor takes us up to the border. We're so close to North Korea now that I could
*27:30.500- 27:37.400* :  just hear North Korean people singing in the fields over there and there are no fences along this line
*27:37.400- 27:42.540* :  that is separating the two countries which means there is nothing to physically stop people
*27:43.120- 27:46.580* :  from walking over into these fields and then on into the village.
*27:53.320- 27:59.440* :  As darkness descends the threat from North Korea rises and the soldiers are now going door-to-door
*27:59.440- 28:07.880* :  to check everyone's at home. The villagers need permission to go outside after seven o'clock.
*28:08.180- 28:12.260* :  This curfew is the most restrictive part of village life here.
*28:17.400- 28:21.800* :  It's the following morning and I've come to meet the Shin family as their two young children
*28:21.800- 28:27.260* :  are getting ready for school. They're a bit of an anomaly here because over the years many young
*28:27.260- 28:33.000* :  people have left the village, lured by the bright lights and opportunities of modern day South Korea
*28:33.000- 28:42.580* :  and the population is dwindling. The curfew is the hardest thing about living here especially
*28:42.580- 28:49.940* :  when you're young and you want to go out and have fun. Do you think young people can be convinced
*28:49.940- 28:57.000* :  to stay here? I don't think it will be easy. It's asking a lot of young people.
*29:00.920- 29:06.100* :  The Shin children attend the village primary school but there are now so few children here,
*29:06.380- 29:12.880* :  most its pupils are bust in from outside. Would you be sad if your children decided
*29:13.780- 29:16.340* :  that they didn't want to return to the village and live here?
*29:18.300- 29:24.060* :  No, I want them to live outside the village in society. I want them to travel and have
*29:31.180- 29:35.480* :  lots of experiences. Not only has the North abandoned reunification but an increasing number
*29:35.480- 29:41.860* :  of South Koreans no longer wanted either and as this dream dies it's getting harder to convince
*29:41.860- 29:46.640* :  people to live here on the front line of a conflict that might never be resolved.
