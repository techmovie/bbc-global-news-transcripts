*01:44.680- 01:48.780* :  Panjaki Leonard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 2nd of March.
*01:49.220- 01:58.400* :  Why these medical students are this happy? The felines and felons supporting each other in
*01:58.400- 02:05.260* :  Chile. Some of them are here for years and the cats are an emotional support for them.
*02:05.800- 02:11.040* :  From being a driver to swinging one, the man hoping to swap grocery deliveries for a professional
*02:11.040- 02:15.980* :  golf after a breakthrough at the Kenya Open. At the end of the days, what I've been working hard for
*02:15.980- 02:22.200* :  probably the last 10 years, so it's definitely a huge step in the right direction and hopefully more to come.
*02:22.200- 02:30.000* :  Also in this podcast, K-pop artists have YouTube series, reality TV shows, all in an effort to
*02:30.000- 02:34.980* :  extend that conversation that they have with their fans and draw them into their world.
*02:35.260- 02:39.220* :  And it's working, we will hear about the rise and rise of K-pop.
*02:44.920- 02:49.260* :  And we begin with this remarkable moment at an auditorium in New York.
*02:49.880- 02:58.000* :  I'm happy to share with you that starting in August this year, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine
*02:58.660- 03:00.300* :  will be tuition free.
*03:07.680- 03:12.540* :  Dr. Ruth Gottesman, a former professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
*03:12.540- 03:17.700* :  announcing that her gift of a billion dollars will mean that students there will get free tuition.
*03:18.020- 03:22.460* :  I have watched that video a lot. Some of them are jumping to their feet. They all look astonished,
*03:22.460- 03:27.800* :  stunned, some are tearful, genuinely an extraordinary moment. Harry Bly reports.
*03:28.660- 03:35.560* :  The average medicine graduate in America can expect to be in around $250,000 of student debt
*03:35.560- 03:38.760* :  when they finish, and this can take decades to repay.
*03:38.760- 03:42.300* :  I think when you're young and you're focused on what you want to do,
*03:43.000- 03:49.400* :  the impact of that life term doesn't really become apparent at the time, so it's expensive.
*03:49.840- 03:56.140* :  That's Dr. Ali Haider, a cardiologist in New York City and a former student of the Albert Einstein
*03:56.140- 04:02.160* :  College of Medicine. I was elated. I was extremely happy. It was to my old institution.
*04:02.880- 04:06.960* :  You know, immediately there was text threads and messages from all my old
*04:07.480- 04:12.780* :  co-student, some of whom I haven't talked to in like over 10 years, talking about how amazing this was,
*04:12.780- 04:17.780* :  so you know, it was really a big deal. None of the students knew what to expect when they
*04:17.780- 04:24.300* :  were called into a mysterious assembly at the school on Monday morning. The tuition fee was
*04:24.300- 04:31.100* :  $59,000 a year, so this extraordinary donation will be transformative for roughly a thousand
*04:31.100- 04:36.580* :  students at the school, which is located in the Bronx, the poorest borough of New York City.
*04:37.000- 04:42.160* :  A lot of people don't decide to go to medical school because, and more so these days,
*04:42.160- 04:47.180* :  especially because of these financial hurdles, and hopefully this will set the stage to help
*04:47.180- 04:52.860* :  offer these pathways to, you know, more individuals who want to do medicine for the right reasons,
*04:53.000- 04:57.080* :  want to go into primary care to really help, you know, our aging communities.
*04:57.780- 05:03.220* :  A day after the announcement, we heard from first-year students Samuel Wu and Jade Andrade.
*05:03.220- 05:10.060* :  For me, I just believe and hope. One of the main impacts of this is how we will have creative
*05:10.060- 05:14.540* :  freedom or be able to really pursue things that are aligned with our personal goals,
*05:14.620- 05:21.740* :  and I hope that it opens doors for individuals who wouldn't have dreamed of being in this position.
*05:22.040- 05:28.260* :  So this is huge news for me. I don't have to work two jobs, and I can focus more on my academics,
*05:28.260- 05:34.000* :  I can focus more on my passions, things like street medicine, and addiction medicine,
*05:34.000- 05:37.660* :  which doesn't pay that much. I'll be able to actually focus on that.
*05:37.880- 05:44.240* :  Now age 93, Dr. Gottesman was, for more than 50 years, a professor of developmental medicine,
*05:44.240- 05:49.820* :  where she put together screening and literacy programs to diagnose and help children and adults
*05:49.820- 05:55.400* :  with learning disabilities. She's also the widow of Wall Street Investor David Gottesman,
*05:55.400- 06:00.920* :  who left her a fortune in his will with one instruction. Do whatever you think is right.
*06:00.920- 06:06.520* :  She approached the head of the medical school, Dr. Philip Azua, a man she had befriended during
*06:06.520- 06:12.280* :  the COVID pandemic. She asked him to name three things she could do for the school. The first,
*06:12.280- 06:17.980* :  he said, was to make education free, and she said, that's it, that's what I want to do,
*06:18.520- 06:23.660* :  and that's exactly what she did. With, it seems, universal approval.
*06:31.720- 06:38.300* :  Harry Bligh. So imagine this. Your job is to deliver groceries for a supermarket, and in your
*06:38.300- 06:47.760* :  spare time you play golf. You are ranked 2,390th in the world, grinding away in the lower reaches of
*06:47.760- 06:53.660* :  the professional game, hoping for that big breakthrough. And then, at the end of a week,
*06:53.660- 06:58.360* :  which had started with grocery deliveries, that you are picking up a check for the equivalent
*06:58.360- 07:06.840* :  of $215,000 for joint second place in the Kenya Open. The BBC's Rob Bonnet spoke to Joe Dean
*07:06.840- 07:11.840* :  from Yorkshire in the north of England, and asked him if it had been hard not to get over excited
*07:11.840- 07:16.920* :  as the round progressed. It is fair to say that Yorkshire men rarely lose their call.
*07:18.060- 07:21.720* :  If you know me well, you know, over time, is it one of my qualities?
*07:23.180- 07:29.440* :  It was a great week, and yeah, fantastic result. I say big breakthrough, is that how you see it?
*07:30.100- 07:35.260* :  Yeah, I mean, at the end of the days, what I've been working hard for for probably the last
*07:35.260- 07:41.720* :  10 years coming up from my professional career. So it's definitely a huge step in the right
*07:41.720- 07:47.700* :  direction, and hopefully more to come. At what point I wondered, you give up the day job and go to
*07:47.700- 07:55.400* :  the other day job? I mean, I think I've got a few weeks off now, so I may be trying to pick a few
*07:55.400- 08:00.920* :  shifts up before I finally send my farewells, but no, it's been fantastic working for Morrison's,
*08:00.920- 08:05.500* :  and the people I've met along the way have been great. Yeah, I can't thank them enough as well,
*08:05.620- 08:12.520* :  so we'll see how the next month goes, but I feel I might be very busy with the golf, so yeah,
*08:12.520- 08:16.680* :  it might be time for me to have my nose in soon. Do you regard yourself as an ambitious person?
*08:17.380- 08:24.680* :  Maybe behind closed doors, yes, like some quite humble person, and I'm not very old.
*08:24.680- 08:30.200* :  You can be both ambitious and humble, can't you? Yeah, I suppose so, yeah, I've got big admissions.
*08:30.240- 08:35.160* :  I want to be places, but there's a lot of stepping stones on the way to being in those places,
*08:35.160- 08:39.520* :  so it's just stepping on those little stepping stones in the meantime and getting there slower.
*08:40.480- 08:45.100* :  As I know, only too well at my very lowly level of golf, the miserable thing about the game is
*08:45.100- 08:49.080* :  that form comes and goes for no apparent reason. Do you think you have the, and I suppose this is
*08:49.080- 08:53.900* :  a serious question, do you have the mentality to be a top 20 golfer? Yeah, I believe so, yeah,
*08:54.140- 09:00.420* :  I mean, again, there's a lot of factors involved in probably lacking in the experience side,
*09:00.420- 09:06.340* :  but there's only one way to gain the experience, so I'm very open and I want to be on that stage,
*09:06.340- 09:14.000* :  so yeah, it's just like, say, getting those small goals ticked off in the meantime and hopefully
*09:14.000- 09:19.380* :  it will lead to being somewhere in the top, world's top 20, top 10. But for the time being,
*09:19.380- 09:24.800* :  it's back to the van. Possibly. We'll see how we like to, we'll see how the next few weeks
*09:24.800- 09:32.480* :  fun out. Bravo to Joe Dean. The pen, as it's called by locals, is the oldest prison in Chile.
*09:32.480- 09:39.400* :  It's overcrowded with around 5,600 prisoners, all serving time for a variety of reasons.
*09:39.420- 09:46.040* :  It's also home to around 300 cats. At first, they were useful for keeping down the rat population,
*09:46.040- 09:51.000* :  but over time, guards and social workers have realised the positive effect that they have on
*09:51.000- 09:56.840* :  the inmate who treat them as part of the family. Our reporter, Jane Chambers, went to meet some of them.
*09:59.420- 10:04.860* :  This is downtown Santiago, the capital of Chile. Outside the prison, women wait with parcels of
*10:04.900- 10:11.700* :  food and white bats for their loved ones. I'm taken through security and made to check in my foe.
*10:12.320- 10:16.900* :  A guard takes me up to the third floor to get a bird's-side view of inmates playing football in the
*10:16.900- 10:22.260* :  patio down below. For security reasons, I'm not allowed into the cells, but I can see them in the
*10:22.260- 10:27.320* :  distance with brightly coloured washing, flapping from the bars, and some cats prowling along the
*10:27.320- 10:33.000* :  walls and over the corrugated iron roofs. Prisoner Carlos Nunez is wandering through the patio,
*10:33.340- 10:38.180* :  cradling his grey cat plumber and his arms. I'm off to chat with him in an office down below.
*10:45.540- 10:50.400* :  Blomos is a bit stressed to be away from his cell, but he soon calms down when he's fed some cat food,
*10:50.840- 10:52.620* :  which is eagerly looking off the table.
*10:55.980- 11:04.720* :  I've had Palomos since he was little. To start with, it was hard to feed him, and I had to give him
*11:04.780- 11:13.240* :  my leftovers, things like chicken skin. Prison's social worker, Carla Contrero Sandovales,
*11:13.240- 11:18.780* :  a big cat lover. She has a cat tattoo on her arm, and even though coordinating the welfare of the
*11:18.780- 11:24.180* :  cats isn't strictly in her job description, she happily works with various charities to make sure
*11:24.180- 11:28.940* :  they have food, are well cared for, and are sterilised to stop the population exploding.
*11:28.940- 11:32.840* :  She's passionate about the positive effect the cats have had on the prisoners.
*11:33.140- 11:37.060* :  It's interesting to see how their relationship with the cats has made them more humane.
*11:37.820- 11:42.240* :  Some of them are here for years, and the cats are an emotional support for them. They make them
*11:42.240- 11:46.920* :  more responsible because they learn how to care for something else, and to make sure they have food
*11:46.920- 11:52.180* :  and a healthy, and it's new for them to empathise and to think of others, as many of them never
*11:52.180- 11:58.320* :  did that when they were on the outside. The prisoners know it's important for the cats to be sterilised,
*11:58.540- 12:02.380* :  and around three times a year a team comes in to operate the cats and register them,
*12:02.380- 12:07.320* :  so they can keep count of the population. Christian Benia Muñoz says his cat,
*12:07.320- 12:12.960* :  Turecha, is like a son for him, especially his family lived far away, so he doesn't get many visitors.
*12:15.460- 12:20.940* :  I asked them to neuter him because he was one of the few cats left, which hadn't been neutered.
*12:21.120- 12:27.640* :  He cried all night looking for female cats, and it made me sad. Also, he was peeing everywhere to
*12:27.640- 12:33.200* :  mark his territory, which annoyed the other inmates. Now he's been done, he's gone back to being
*12:33.200- 12:43.220* :  like a kitten, and he's happy, and plays all the time. A big issue for some prisoners is what
*12:43.220- 12:49.060* :  will happen to their beloved cats when they finally get out. Nermias Echeveda Flores has been in
*12:49.060- 12:54.740* :  prison for nearly nine years. He's convinced that his cat, Chinoe, is better off on the outside,
*12:54.740- 12:59.600* :  so he persuaded the prison officers to let his sister take the cat. He's nearing the end of
*12:59.600- 13:04.600* :  his sentence and make sure he's on his best behavior, so he can visit Chinoe on Sundays.
*13:06.400- 13:13.100* :  First Chinoe was with me in color eight, and then we moved to color 11. He was with me all the time
*13:13.100- 13:19.320* :  keeping me company. And now, when I go and see him at the weekend at my sisters, he still remembers me.
*13:19.600- 13:24.440* :  I call him, and he comes running to see me, and acts all happy. He's a very clever cat.
*13:26.800- 13:32.660* :  Nermias Echeveda Flores and a very clever cat, ending that report by Jane Chambers in Chile.
*13:33.660- 13:38.500* :  Now, if you have a daughter, or you are one, you might be interested to know that the World
*13:38.500- 13:43.840* :  Service podcast Dear Daughter is back for a third series. Every episode features a letter from
*13:43.840- 13:49.260* :  people around the world, to their daughters, and the goal of presenter Namolanta combo is to
*13:49.260- 13:54.880* :  collect advice for daughters everywhere, including her own wisdom being passed to the next generation.
*13:55.720- 14:00.940* :  This season will run for 15 episodes, and we'll be talking to letter writers from all over the
*14:00.940- 14:06.600* :  world about a whole range of themes, everything from work-life balance to beauty standards to different
*14:06.600- 14:12.820* :  types of families, and we'll be talking to celebrity baker Nadia Hussein, who's one of my personal
*14:12.820- 14:17.040* :  heroes, and she's talking about the close relationship that she has with her own daughter.
*14:42.460- 14:46.680* :  You know, like, she will tell me, and I'm like, whoa, what's happened?
*14:47.560- 14:50.840* :  Tell us about the progression from series one to season three.
*14:52.040- 14:56.500* :  Well, I don't think anything has changed in the sense of the fact that I'm having really
*14:56.500- 15:03.200* :  relatable universal conversations. People are thinking and feeling the same things about their
*15:03.200- 15:08.160* :  daughters from all over the world. That hasn't changed, but for this season, what we're focusing on
*15:08.160- 15:14.880* :  is the growth that our guests have had from their own experiences, and they're looking back at their
*15:15.240- 15:21.520* :  situations with humor or with pride, and the season was inspired by my daughter Coco, who's now seven.
*15:22.260- 15:26.880* :  She's ever growing, ever changing, you know. She must be very proud of you.
*15:26.880- 15:28.440* :  Does she understand what you're doing now?
*15:29.340- 15:33.760* :  Yes, she's getting much better, but now she's critiquing, so we're doing that now.
*15:35.720- 15:39.980* :  Everyone's a critic. Tell us a little bit more about the topics, the sorts of topics you
*15:39.980- 15:45.560* :  want to feature in this series. So we're keen on getting some of the funniest stories in,
*15:45.980- 15:51.240* :  because parenting can be very hard, and all you can do sometimes is laugh at the situation,
*15:51.300- 15:57.320* :  or, you know, what's going on. So we'd love some funny letters. We want to hear more about
*15:57.320- 16:01.340* :  raising teens. I need to hear more about raising teens as I get to that stage.
*16:02.020- 16:07.580* :  Always be prepared is my motto. I'm nosy. I just want to know. I also want to know about different
*16:07.580- 16:13.180* :  types of families, or maybe there's just the one story that is something massive that's happened
*16:13.180- 16:17.960* :  in your own life. What do you want to share about it? What do you want to tell us? And, you know,

*16:56.520- 17:02.100* :  humour is not something human, so it can also be found in animals.
*17:02.700- 17:06.060* :  Another thing humans have in common with our great ape cousins.
*17:18.000- 17:19.180* :  Where's that dust coming from?

*19:05.620- 19:12.060* :  years, the Hadakka Matsuri, or Naked Festival, at the Konomiya Shrine in central Japan,
*19:12.060- 19:15.260* :  has included a group of women they did keep their clothes on.
*19:15.540- 19:19.900* :  The idea of the festival is to drive away evil spirits before praying for happiness.
*19:19.900- 19:24.780* :  A priest at the shrine said there was never an actual ban as such on women's participation,
*19:24.880- 19:27.500* :  but no one had ever asked. See, you don't ask.
*19:28.060- 19:32.300* :  Then there was the five-year-old autistic girl who got lost in a swamp in Florida this week.
*19:32.300- 19:36.420* :  Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office threw everything they had at it,
*19:36.540- 19:40.920* :  including thermal cameras, and they found her safe and sound. This is how that happened.
*19:55.020- 19:55.640* :  Hey!
*20:02.860- 20:03.520* :  Hey!
*20:05.540- 20:08.160* :  How did you do? Let's get you out of the water!
*20:09.680- 20:12.580* :  Well done, everyone involved, and you might have heard this this week.
*20:20.560- 20:26.180* :  That is a very small fish. The Daniela Le Cerebrum transparent just over a centimetre long,
*20:26.180- 20:32.200* :  and it could just be the loudest for its size ever discovered. It apparently can produce 140
*20:32.200- 20:38.820* :  decibels, as loud as a gunshot or jackhammer. More about that on our science pages by BBC.com
*20:38.820- 20:44.440* :  slash news. Now a good sense of humour is considered a very important thing by many of us,
*20:44.440- 20:49.280* :  and it seems that observing and understanding the mischievous behaviour of our cousins,
*20:49.280- 20:55.380* :  the ape kind, not your auntie's kids, could give us clues to the origins of humans' sense of
*20:55.380- 21:01.400* :  fun. Isabel Lauma at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany told us more.
*21:02.340- 21:08.100* :  So we were looking for sequences of playful teasing in the Great Apes, and we looked at all for
*21:08.100- 21:15.920* :  species, so chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans and gorillas. So we found evidence of playful teasing
*21:15.920- 21:21.440* :  in all for great ape species, and that is particularly interesting because this tells us about
*21:21.440- 21:28.580* :  evolution of humour in our species as well. Because we found it in all four species, it's likely
*21:28.580- 21:33.320* :  that playful teasing and its cognitive prerequisites may have been present in our last common ancestor,
*21:33.340- 21:39.580* :  which lived 13 million years ago. What does playful teasing entail?
*21:40.260- 21:44.760* :  Playful teasing is a distinct behaviour that lies between play and aggression, so it's playful,
*21:44.760- 21:51.200* :  also irritating and annoying. The one is poking and hitting, and I mean always was usually
*21:51.200- 21:55.800* :  accompanied by response looking, so seemingly carefully evaluating how far I can go,
*21:56.840- 22:01.100* :  then for example hindering movement, when they would jump into the way of the other,
*22:01.680- 22:06.860* :  and body slamming, which means to jump onto the other individual, but they sometimes also showed
*22:06.860- 22:12.820* :  body slamming and surprise, so they would surprise another by actually jumping on the back of the
*22:12.820- 22:19.200* :  other, from behind. And also, but it was also very interesting, it occurred between individuals
*22:19.200- 22:25.700* :  with very different body size, and juveniles were teasing adults, that was the most common
*22:26.520- 22:34.620* :  teasing partner we observed. And they are our cousins, is humour where we look for some of
*22:34.620- 22:41.740* :  our great similarities? Playful teasing is definitely one of the similarities that we share
*22:41.740- 22:50.940* :  with our closest relatives, so our results support the notion that humour is not something human,
*22:51.020- 23:00.860* :  so it can also be found in animals. What do you get out of this research? What does it mean to you
*23:00.860- 23:06.740* :  finding out more about these amazing creatures? For me as a scientist, it's not only important to
*23:06.740- 23:12.120* :  just find out more about their fascinating cognitive abilities and behaviours, because they are
*23:12.120- 23:18.380* :  in so many ways very much human-like, but it's also extremely important to me to raise awareness
*23:18.380- 23:25.760* :  on the critically endangered status. So our next step would be to unravel the evolution of humour,
*23:26.400- 23:33.100* :  by also looking not only at great apes, but even completely different animals, like for example,
*23:33.100- 23:41.660* :  say birds. And we also have a website coming up, so people can actually, in case they see some
*23:41.960- 23:47.740* :  playful teasing, or they think it's playful teasing in their pet, they can actually upload those
*23:47.740- 23:53.080* :  videos and we can have a look at it. That was Isabel Lauma of the Max Planck Institute of
*23:53.080- 23:57.360* :  Animal Behavior and the website she was talking about will be up in the next few weeks and don't
*23:57.360- 24:04.020* :  worry, we will remind you. Now for a musical interlude specifically, let's look at the rise
*24:04.020- 24:12.200* :  and rise of K-pop. Four of 2023's top 10 best-selling acts came from South Korea. Our musical
*24:12.200- 24:16.180* :  correspondent Mark Savage told us about the genre's dramatic ascent.
*24:16.900- 24:23.340* :  Si was definitely the first K-pop artist who had a global hit and that's 12 years ago when Gangnam
*24:23.340- 24:29.480* :  styled. As you remember, swept the globe with the YouTube dance, but that was kind of almost
*24:29.480- 24:35.240* :  like a comedy song, you know, it was novelty. I think the bands that are coming through in his
*24:35.240- 24:42.800* :  wake are much more serious about the music they make and they're really trying to colonise
*24:42.800- 24:48.700* :  the Western pop charts. And why is it able to happen now? Is it because of social media and
*24:48.700- 24:54.940* :  there's less gatekeeping by music stations in the West and people are exposed to more influences
*24:54.940- 25:01.240* :  or what is it? You're absolutely right. I think social media, but also streaming, means that
*25:01.240- 25:07.040* :  you can listen to any music and if you like it, you'll stick with it and those streams can't
*25:07.040- 25:13.640* :  towards the charts and so the sales build up and build up and build up. You know, K-pop is very,
*25:13.640- 25:21.440* :  very well strategised in terms of how they market to fans. K-pop artists have YouTube series,
*25:21.440- 25:28.280* :  reality TV shows, all in an effort to extend that conversation that they have with their fans and
*25:28.280- 25:33.120* :  draw them into their world and that's something that a lot of Western pop acts still haven't really
*25:33.120- 25:41.560* :  caught on to. What are the secrets of K-pop artists' success? It's not just the social media,
*25:42.100- 25:50.600* :  it's almost like a military, highly disciplined strategy to get everything 100% right.
*25:51.540- 25:58.320* :  Yes, the K-pop industry is very, very tough on the people who make the music.
*25:58.780- 26:02.740* :  If you look at a band like Blackpink, they were taken away from their parents' homes when
*26:02.740- 26:08.960* :  they were teenagers and put through six years of boot camp learning different dance styles,
*26:08.960- 26:15.880* :  ways to harmonise, rap cadences that they might use in their songs and they were competing the
*26:15.880- 26:20.620* :  whole time against other girls who might make it into this four-piece group.
*26:29.400- 26:35.260* :  And so when they emerge on the stage after this hugely testing period of development,
*26:36.020- 26:41.900* :  they are ready for anything. It's almost robotic how clean and precise their dance moves are
*26:42.200- 26:47.060* :  and how good their live vocals are and it's the same for BTS, it's the same for 17 and
*26:47.060- 26:53.380* :  stray kids and all of those acts who come out of that industry. So they are obviously
*26:53.380- 26:59.180* :  making a huge global impact on the music industry. Where do they go from here?
*26:59.920- 27:04.500* :  So the figures that came out last week from the IFPI, which is the trade body for the global
*27:04.500- 27:10.060* :  music industry, showed that four of the top 10 best-selling artists in the world last year
*27:10.740- 27:17.560* :  were from South Korea and Taylor Swift was the biggest seller obviously but 17 who are a massive
*27:17.560- 27:22.580* :  boy band, they were the second biggest sellers and stray kids were the third biggest sellers.
*27:22.960- 27:29.300* :  So those are big numbers, they are selling millions of copies and so I think it's only going to get
*27:29.300- 27:36.820* :  bigger. And just finally Mark, do you think that we're actually getting better globally at appreciating
*27:36.840- 27:42.520* :  art and music from cultures that aren't our own? I mean the Grammys this year had the Afro beats
*27:42.560- 27:49.180* :  category for the first time. Being as we all have access to streaming and social media and all
*27:49.180- 27:54.820* :  of those things, are we getting more open-minded or are the acts becoming more homogenous?
*27:55.620- 28:03.560* :  I mean certainly some of the more popular K-pop artists have achieved success by using western
*28:03.560- 28:10.140* :  writers and producers and so there is a homogeneity there but I do think like you say people are
*28:10.140- 28:15.180* :  opening up, I think particularly for the younger generation, they don't care where their music comes
*28:15.200- 28:19.780* :  from, they don't even care if it's new or old, they just want something that they like and I think
*28:19.780- 28:28.400* :  what K-pop does really well is that it innovates, it's not making cookie cutter radio fodder,
*28:28.640- 28:33.200* :  it's not pandering to algorithms. So if you take a band like Stray Kids who write all of their
*28:33.200- 28:39.880* :  own songs, they almost make it a challenge to get as many different styles into one track as they
*28:39.880- 28:44.160* :  can, they've got a song called S-Class which kind of starts off with this military beat
*28:48.900- 28:56.080* :  and then it goes into Euro Dance EDM kind of drop with this huge thundering bass, then there's a
*28:56.080- 28:59.620* :  bit of rap, then it goes into 1990s hip-hop from New York,
*29:07.420- 29:14.200* :  ends with this kind of crazy explosion of guitars, on paper it shouldn't work but when you listen
*29:14.240- 29:24.080* :  to it and when your ears adjust to it, it's really really clever. Stray Kids making us sound a lot
*29:24.080- 29:32.800* :  more cool than usual, ending that report by Mark Savage and that's it from us for now,
