*01:28.000- 01:33.180* :  women are living their best lives. We're here to shine a light on some surprising and inspiring
*01:33.180- 01:38.040* :  places and what we can learn from them. Let's be a woman from the BBC World Service. Listen
*01:38.040- 01:46.660* :  now wherever you get your BBC podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:46.900- 01:54.720* :  I'm Janet Gillil and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 5th of March these are our main stories.
*01:55.460- 02:00.780* :  Ukraine claims another success in the Black Sea, saying its drones have destroyed a Russian
*02:00.780- 02:07.560* :  patrol ship. China announces ambitious growth targets but are they realistic given its economic
*02:07.560- 02:15.320* :  woes? At least 35 people are killed as unexpected snows and freezing rains hit parts of Pakistan.
*02:18.240- 02:23.480* :  Also in this podcast more than a dozen US states pick their presidential choice in super
*02:23.480- 02:29.840* :  Tuesday elections but many are un-enthused by either Joe Biden or Donald Trump.
*02:30.140- 02:35.180* :  I do wish there were more choices. That's another thing. I don't love about our political system here.
*02:35.560- 02:38.480* :  Contenders have been there before and they're kind of ready to go again.
*02:39.240- 02:43.500* :  And a festival like no other in a Malawian refugee camp.
*02:47.260- 02:51.500* :  10 years ago Russia illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.
*02:52.040- 02:57.500* :  In recent months Ukraine has repeatedly hit Russia's Black Sea fleet which is stationed off the
*02:57.500- 03:03.680* :  peninsula. Now Kiev says it's destroyed another ship using drones causing some casualties.
*03:04.480- 03:07.660* :  As we record this podcast there's been no word from Moscow.
*03:08.660- 03:13.680* :  Meanwhile the German Defence Minister has been speaking about an embarrassing leak where it appears
*03:14.060- 03:18.640* :  Russia managed to intercept a high-level military meeting on Ukraine.
*03:19.540- 03:22.740* :  We got more on both these developments with Vitaly Shevchenko,
*03:22.740- 03:26.960* :  Russia editor at BBC Monitoring. First he spoke about the naval attack.
*03:27.600- 03:35.440* :  It has resulted in the sinking or severe damage but we think it's the sinking of the Sergei Kotov
*03:35.680- 03:41.340* :  which is one of the most modern and expensive patrol boats that Russia has.
*03:41.340- 03:48.300* :  It's only been in use for a year and a half and it was a prime target for the Ukrainian
*03:48.300- 03:53.580* :  military. They tried to hit it three times already and the fourth time was lucky for the Ukrainians
*03:53.820- 04:05.560* :  and they sank it with Magura naval drones and the impact of this sinking is important because
*04:05.560- 04:12.960* :  it will make it more difficult for Russia to target Ukrainian cities or with missiles because
*04:13.680- 04:22.040* :  some of them have been fired from Black Sea fleet ships and Ukrainians say that Russia had been
*04:22.040- 04:27.080* :  planning to put missiles on board the Sergei Kotov. We don't know whether that's true or not.
*04:27.920- 04:35.300* :  So in terms of confirmation that this happened we've seen footage apparently filmed by a member
*04:35.300- 04:41.700* :  of the public at night showing apparently this ship being attacked and also there's footage
*04:41.700- 04:49.900* :  published by the Ukrainian military showing the attack. So that's a military situation. Let's talk
*04:49.900- 04:55.780* :  more about what's happening with the Allies because we've heard some more from Germany, from the
*04:55.780- 05:02.680* :  Defence Minister, insisting that NATO Allies can still trust Berlin after that embarrassing leak
*05:02.680- 05:09.060* :  a few days ago. Just just remind us what happened there and I think the Defence Minister has been
*05:09.060- 05:15.520* :  giving more details about this today as well. The Russians, they published a nausea very long,
*05:15.520- 05:26.840* :  38 minutes of what appears to be a meeting between top German commanders discussing whether Germany
*05:26.840- 05:35.000* :  should or could supply Ukraine with very sophisticated long-range missiles called the Taurus.
*05:36.020- 05:43.300* :  And at one point they said that these missiles could be used by Ukraine to target the Kerrich
*05:43.780- 05:51.220* :  bridge linking annex Crimea to Russia. The line taken by the German leadership as that Germany
*05:51.800- 05:56.960* :  should not supply Ukraine with these missiles because Ukraine could potentially use them to attack
*05:56.960- 06:03.220* :  Moscow, leading to accusations of Germany's direct involvement in such attacks and this is
*06:03.220- 06:10.200* :  exactly what German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is keen to avoid. And the German officers discussing
*06:10.200- 06:17.100* :  this apparently they don't really oppose such supplies to Ukraine. So there's a bit of a
*06:17.300- 06:25.480* :  rift going on there. So of course this has led to accusations of whether Germany can be trusted
*06:25.480- 06:32.720* :  to even discuss this supplies and clearly the German Defence Minister is keen to stress that
*06:32.720- 06:39.360* :  oh yes Germany can still be trusted. Vitaly Schiffchenko, for decades the global economy has
*06:39.360- 06:44.140* :  relied on China's rapid development and vast population to propel growth elsewhere.
*06:44.920- 06:49.860* :  But last year was a difficult one for the world's second biggest economy as its post-pandemic
*06:49.860- 06:56.440* :  recovery started amid a property crisis, deepening deflation and shares falling as foreign
*06:56.440- 07:02.120* :  investors pull out. So many will be watching this week's annual political gathering in Beijing,
*07:02.120- 07:06.460* :  the biggest of the year, which includes the rubber stamp parliament to the National People's
*07:06.780- 07:12.620* :  Congress, hoping to get some clues into how China's all-powerful ruler, Xi Jinping,
*07:12.620- 07:19.580* :  plans to tackle the slowing economy. The Chinese Premier, Li Chiang, has set ambitious targets.
*07:25.240- 07:31.320* :  He told delegates that China was aiming for around 5% growth this year and to create 12
*07:31.340- 07:38.880* :  million jobs in the cities. But are these targets too ambitious? Our correspondent in Beijing
*07:38.880- 07:44.400* :  is Stephen McDonald and he gave us this assessment. A lot of people scratching heads wondering how
*07:44.400- 07:51.640* :  you would get 5% GDP growth given all the really problem areas in the Chinese economy,
*07:51.640- 07:56.560* :  especially the real estate sector, which has been suffering enormously. People have plunged their
*07:56.560- 08:02.620* :  entire life savings into buying flats, apartments that have never been delivered.
*08:03.540- 08:10.780* :  University graduates can't get decent jobs, huge youth unemployment, local governments in debt.
*08:11.620- 08:17.460* :  And yet, Li Chiang said today that there's going to be more investment in R&D, in science and
*08:17.460- 08:25.040* :  technology, and that there would be a sort of consumption-led revival of the economy. And that
*08:25.040- 08:31.380* :  this could be achieved by paying people more money and creating more jobs. But I mean,
*08:31.660- 08:36.140* :  sure, on the face of it, that sounds like a not a bad idea. But the problem with these
*08:37.140- 08:43.460* :  reports, these government work reports, they can be heavy on jargon, on political slogan-earing,
*08:43.460- 08:47.840* :  and pretty light on when it comes to specifics. For example, I mean, I'll just give you one
*08:47.840- 08:53.100* :  little quote from the Premier, in order to fulfill the development goals and tasks for this year,
*08:53.100- 08:59.460* :  we must act on Xi Jinping's economic thinking and devote full energy to promoting high-quality
*09:00.020- 09:06.140* :  development. Well, you know, what does that really mean? Again, I think a lot of Chinese people
*09:06.140- 09:10.080* :  would be looking at this and thinking, well, I'm kind of glad that you're acknowledging the problems
*09:10.080- 09:14.920* :  that the economy is facing, but I'm still not convinced that you've got the answers.
*09:15.880- 09:20.880* :  And at the same time, China also announced it was increasing defence spending by 7%, I think,
*09:20.880- 09:26.840* :  despite its economic woes. That's a big concern, too, for its neighbours and especially Taiwan.
*09:27.440- 09:32.220* :  I've got to say, when it comes to the defence spending numbers, I've never really believed
*09:32.220- 09:38.380* :  them anyway. They could say anything, and people would just have to take it at face value.
*09:38.940- 09:44.880* :  You can see everywhere that China's expanding its military building islands and the South China sea,
*09:45.020- 09:52.120* :  developing aircraft carrier battle groups, so the number in a way doesn't really matter.
*09:52.500- 09:57.320* :  It's just that China definitely is building up its military quite a lot.
*09:58.120- 10:03.980* :  Stephen McDonald in Beijing. It's one of the most significant dates in the US political calendar.
*10:04.460- 10:09.540* :  Super Tuesday, when millions of voters in more than a dozen states pick their democratic and
*10:09.540- 10:14.500* :  republican candidates for the presidential election. So far, it's looking like it will be
*10:14.500- 10:20.440* :  a rerun of 2020, with Joe Biden and Donald Trump widely expected to face each other again this
*10:20.440- 10:26.560* :  November. Some states had tried to exclude Mr Trump from the ballot, but on Monday, the Supreme
*10:26.560- 10:32.720* :  Court ruled only Congress had that power. Our North America correspondent, Emabadi, reports from
*10:32.720- 10:41.140* :  an ice hockey game in Colorado. It's a big voting day in Colorado, but for these players,
*10:41.140- 10:48.960* :  just another day on the ice. While millions of votes are being cast, it's already pretty clear
*10:48.960- 10:56.000* :  which candidates will eventually face off in the presidential battle. As voters go to the polls,
*10:56.000- 11:01.120* :  sisters Mandy and Nikki are gearing up for a hockey match. We are such a divided nation,
*11:01.180- 11:05.220* :  but the one thing I like is when I walk into the hockey ring, we're all the same. We're all hockey
*11:05.220- 11:10.280* :  players. We all skate the same. We all shoot the same, and we're all here to support each other.
*11:11.500- 11:16.640* :  But it's a different feeling on the campaign trail. Sixteen states, including here in Colorado,
*11:16.640- 11:21.440* :  are holding votes to decide the republican and democratic presidential candidates.
*11:25.020- 11:30.800* :  Before polls have even closed, there's been a victory for Donald Trump. The state of Colorado was
*11:30.800- 11:35.840* :  in a fight to kick him off the ballot entirely for his role in the Capitol riots on January the
*11:35.840- 11:42.520* :  6th, but the US Supreme Court struck it down. You cannot take somebody out of a race because an
*11:42.520- 11:47.540* :  opponent would like to have it that way, and it has nothing to do with the fact that it's the
*11:47.540- 11:52.800* :  leading candidate, whether it was the leading candidate or a candidate that was well down on the
*11:52.800- 11:59.600* :  totem pole, you cannot take somebody out of a race. Despite Donald Trump's massive lead,
*11:59.600- 12:07.680* :  his republican opponent is undeterred. We had 14 people in the race. I defeated a dozen of the
*12:07.680- 12:17.660* :  fellas. I just have one more fella I gotta catch up to. The question after Super Tuesday is whether
*12:17.660- 12:24.100* :  Nicky Haley quits the race or decides to hang on. I voted for Donald Trump twice. I was proud
*12:24.100- 12:31.800* :  to serve American, his administration, but chaos follows him. And we can't be a country in
*12:31.800- 12:36.220* :  disarray in a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. We won't survive.
*12:40.460- 12:45.920* :  And it wasn't President Joe Biden, but the first lady doing the rounds on the democratic side,
*12:46.320- 12:54.060* :  going after female voters. Joe has spent his entire career lifting up women. But Donald Trump,
*12:55.840- 13:05.200* :  he spent a lifetime tearing us down. But back at the rink, the prospect of a Joe Biden rematch
*13:05.200- 13:10.500* :  with Donald Trump is unpopular with voters. I do wish there were more choices. That's another
*13:10.500- 13:14.740* :  thing. I don't love about our political system here. The tenders that have been there before and
*13:14.740- 13:22.160* :  are ready to go again. Not the most exciting match. Not this time. This is neither Joe Biden nor Donald
*13:22.160- 13:27.620* :  Trump has any serious competition this year as political games go. The result is rather a
*13:27.620- 13:33.560* :  full-gone conclusion. What matters now is that after Tuesday, the real start of the election campaign
*13:33.560- 13:40.420* :  will begin. And unlike this somewhat predictable Super Tuesday, the result of the presidential
*13:40.420- 13:48.360* :  election in November will be much harder to call. That report by Emma Vardy.
*13:49.140- 13:54.140* :  A first of its kind, methane monitoring satellite, the size of a washing machine, has been
*13:54.140- 13:58.380* :  launched with the aim of significantly reducing emissions of the greenhouse gas.
*13:59.300- 14:04.820* :  Methane sat will circle the earth to track leaks from oil and gas facilities in real time.
*14:04.820- 14:09.980* :  And the data will be made public to name and shame the worst polluters.
*14:10.400- 14:14.660* :  Albert Orrenti is an atmospheric scientist at the Environmental Defence Fund in New York,
*14:14.660- 14:19.440* :  which developed the satellite. We know that these emissions are fixable. So with current
*14:19.440- 14:25.180* :  technologies, all the methane emissions from the oil and gas operations can actually be fixed,
*14:25.180- 14:30.120* :  at almost zero cost. So if you don't know where the emissions are happening, you cannot fix them.
*14:30.120- 14:33.780* :  So if you have data on where the emissions are happening, you can fix them.
*14:34.060- 14:37.860* :  The first results from the satellite are expected to be made available in a few months time.
*14:38.280- 14:42.620* :  And there are high hopes that the data will bring accountability to companies that have pledged to
*14:42.620- 14:47.760* :  reduce methane emissions to zero, as our climate editor Justin Rowland explains.
*14:48.360- 14:53.260* :  Methane gas is natural gas. It's what people burn in their homes to power their boilers and that
*14:53.260- 14:57.600* :  kind of thing. So it's very useful. So plugging leaks means you've got more of the stuff, which
*14:57.600- 15:02.580* :  obviously is good news. So it means actually it can be profitable to plug the leaks or very cheap.
*15:02.580- 15:07.320* :  So they have an interest to do it, but there are occasions when they release methane where it
*15:07.320- 15:12.240* :  might be very difficult to fix. And in that case, then the data is not there publicly. So regulators
*15:12.240- 15:17.000* :  and indeed the general public campaigning organisations could say, well, there's been a leak there
*15:17.000- 15:21.700* :  for two days. Why haven't you done anything about it? So yeah, we will be able to use that data
*15:22.080- 15:27.700* :  to identify leaks and make sure that people plug them where they can and should plug them.
*15:28.020- 15:33.660* :  Now let's just say, I mean, on methane, it is a very powerful warming gas. 80 times the warming
*15:33.660- 15:39.060* :  potential of carbon dioxide, but crucially hangs around in the atmosphere far less time. So about 12
*15:39.100- 15:45.100* :  years compared to centuries for carbon dioxide. So what that means is if we can reduce emissions
*15:45.100- 15:51.520* :  of methane, we can begin to slow climate change much more quickly. And methane is a big contributor.
*15:51.520- 15:55.420* :  It's about a third of all the climate change we've experienced since the beginning of the industrial
*15:55.420- 16:00.500* :  revolution is from methane. So this is a really important target and this is a really useful tool.

*17:55.100- 17:59.380* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Let's turn to Haiti now where the capital
*17:59.380- 18:04.940* :  Porto Prince has been under a 72-hour state of emergency since Sunday. It was introduced after
*18:04.940- 18:10.660* :  armed gangs freed nearly 4,000 prisoners from the capital's biggest jail. In the latest
*18:10.660- 18:14.820* :  violence, soldiers have been deployed to defend the airport in the capital after gunfire was
*18:14.820- 18:20.060* :  exchanged between security forces and armed men. The gangs aim is to prevent the return to Haiti
*18:20.060- 18:26.760* :  of the Prime Minister Ariel Henri, who was abroad when this violence erupted. Matthias Pierre is
*18:26.760- 18:31.320* :  a former minister in the Haitian government. He spoke to Rob Young about the violence in Porto
*18:31.320- 18:38.340* :  Prince. For quite a while now, Porto Prince has been encircled by gangs and certainly the only
*18:38.340- 18:45.620* :  point of entry in and out of the city was by air, which is the international airport.
*18:45.980- 18:52.360* :  The past two days, I think the gang will make a tentative to capture on the airport,
*18:52.720- 18:58.980* :  and since then, they've been attacked by the gang members on different police stations.
*18:59.540- 19:06.540* :  I think we can count around 40 police stations that have been dismantled by the gang.
*19:06.540- 19:15.720* :  So creating a chaos. Did you say 40? And now 40, according to information that have been corrected.
*19:16.280- 19:23.000* :  Do you know where the Prime Minister is, Ariel Henri, because it's unclear whether he is back in
*19:23.000- 19:27.280* :  the country or not, and so the attack on the airport may have been an attempt to capture that
*19:27.280- 19:33.360* :  to prevent him from returning? He tried for my information that I had to get in the country through
*19:33.700- 19:38.440* :  American Airlines, and since for the past three days, American Airlines has been cancelled his flight.
*19:38.580- 19:46.060* :  I think tonight they were trying to charter him to the country, but I think information that I
*19:46.060- 19:52.560* :  have, the flight was cancelled late tonight, because it seems that the police and the army
*19:53.080- 19:58.160* :  are what we mean. I've been trying to secure the airport, but it was too late.
*19:58.460- 20:03.600* :  Well, the gangs have said very clearly they want to oust him from power, and they are currently
*20:03.980- 20:07.980* :  in effect preventing him from returning to the country. That's astonishing, isn't it?
*20:08.500- 20:14.360* :  At certain point, the Prime Minister created this. For the past three years now, since the assassination
*20:14.360- 20:21.160* :  of the President, he got two power, the pseudo-objectives was to organize elections in the country.
*20:21.580- 20:28.520* :  And he didn't do it after the first year, and the gangs trying to increase their capacity
*20:29.200- 20:34.100* :  more and more. The strategy of the Prime Minister was to say, listen, there's no security,
*20:34.100- 20:41.860* :  there can be election. And in that strategy, how to get security never did anything to try to
*20:41.860- 20:48.140* :  reinforce the national police or the national army. Well, let me just try to get this multi-national
*20:49.020- 20:54.380* :  force led by Kenyan police officers, and he was in Kenya in recent days, wasn't he? Let me ask
*20:54.380- 21:00.340* :  you about what it is like if you leave your home. Is anybody leaving their home, or any shops,
*21:00.340- 21:07.280* :  other businesses operating? Generally speaking in the country, nothing is working. There is the
*21:07.280- 21:14.360* :  state of emergency. Are people just too scared to go out? Too frightened? I think definitely people
*21:14.360- 21:20.180* :  are scared to go out, because when you have so many people out there and creating chaos,
*21:20.240- 21:23.580* :  you don't know what you're going to get out there. So the best thing when you get in those
*21:23.580- 21:31.060* :  situations is to say. The former Haitian Minister Matthias Pierre. At least 35 people have died,
*21:31.060- 21:37.200* :  while dozens more have been injured as unexpected snowfall and freezing rain have hit northern and
*21:37.200- 21:43.380* :  western regions of Pakistan over the weekend. 22 children were among the dead, many of them crushed
*21:43.380- 21:48.840* :  in landslides that buried their homes. Our reporter for her job, it told us more about this
*21:48.840- 21:54.320* :  freak weather. It's very surprising, but I think this is what is happening due to the climate change
*21:54.320- 21:58.560* :  in almost every country. And Pakistan is one of those countries which has been suffering the most.
*21:59.040- 22:03.180* :  So what is happening now? I mean, snowfall, that is not very unusual during this time of the year,
*22:03.180- 22:08.420* :  especially in the northwestern parts of the country. But what we are witnessing now is a little
*22:08.940- 22:14.220* :  in many parts. For example, if in northwestern province, there's a city known as Kadak, it's usually
*22:14.220- 22:20.320* :  it has a very dry sort of weather, but there was a heavy snowfall in that city. And then if we go
*22:20.320- 22:26.200* :  further down towards south, which are usually very hot areas in Gawadar, which is a coastal city,
*22:26.280- 22:30.560* :  there is a flood-like situation there for past many days and people's property has been destroyed
*22:30.560- 22:35.100* :  and we are talking about a country where infrastructure is not really good. And these areas,
*22:35.100- 22:40.740* :  they need a stable connection with the rest of the country with main cities for daily
*22:40.740- 22:46.600* :  commodities and supplies like that, which is now broken. For example, in northwest in Gilgit,
*22:46.600- 22:52.180* :  Baltistan, Karakaramhiva, which connects Pakistan and China, that has been blocked at many points.
*22:52.180- 22:57.700* :  So it's very chaotic in the country. Now, as you mentioned, 35 people have been killed during these
*22:58.000- 23:04.100* :  rains and landslides, et cetera. And 22 of them are children who were probably inside their homes
*23:04.100- 23:08.660* :  during this landslide or when their properties collapsed. Are you surprised by so many deaths?
*23:08.660- 23:14.260* :  I mean, given that Pakistan has been experiencing extreme weather flooding, as you said, snow now,
*23:14.260- 23:17.640* :  that the authorities haven't made better preparations to protect people.
*23:17.860- 23:22.500* :  You know, so that's a problem. And just two years ago, there were massive floods in the country
*23:22.500- 23:27.540* :  and that destroyed like millions of dollars of property and there was a loss of life as well.
*23:27.980- 23:33.800* :  I am surprised because this time of year is very unusual for heavy rains and snow
*23:33.800- 23:40.140* :  falls and landslides and areas like Karak or Gawadar and South southern part. That is very
*23:40.140- 23:45.660* :  surprising and unusual. And then Pakistan's economy is a struggling economy and we have seen in
*23:45.660- 23:50.140* :  the past as well. There haven't been very good arrangements by the authorities to deal with such
*23:50.140- 23:57.080* :  situations. And after recent floods, it deteriorated even more. So I think that is one reason that we
*23:57.080- 24:01.460* :  have seen so much loss of life, et cetera. And then it was unexpected for people as well who were
*24:01.460- 24:07.540* :  living in Dortherias. Fahad Javid. Now to the world's first and only, as far as we're aware,
*24:07.540- 24:14.100* :  festival held in a refugee camp. The Tumaini festival in Malawi was founded by Trezor Imponi,
*24:14.100- 24:19.240* :  who came to the Zalekha refugee camp after being forced to leave the Democratic Republic of Congo.
*24:20.100- 24:26.080* :  Against considerable odds, up to 50,000 people are attending according to Trezor.
*24:26.760- 24:34.940* :  And more than 115 artists performed at the festival last year. Trezor told Victoria Uwakunda more about it.
*24:37.660- 24:40.440* :  Tumaini is a Israeli word that means hope.
*24:44.040- 24:50.760* :  With my experience as a refugee in Malawi, when I arrived 16 years ago at the Zalekha refugee camp,
*24:51.400- 24:58.280* :  being in the community, I realized that there was a lot of people didn't have hope. Because you have
*24:58.280- 25:03.960* :  people that were born in their refugee camp, people that have stayed in their refugee camp for more
*25:03.960- 25:09.680* :  than 30 years. Some of them, sometimes they feel like they do not have a future. Like refugees,
*25:09.680- 25:13.920* :  they don't have the freedom of movement, the rights to work or start businesses outside their
*25:13.920- 25:20.340* :  refugee camp. And that's why I thought that we should bring something that can bring a smile
*25:20.820- 25:26.540* :  and make the community feel that we are not alone, we are part of the bigger world, we are part of
*25:26.640- 25:27.580* :  the global community.
*25:40.380- 25:45.340* :  At the works from the people from the camp or is it from elsewhere?
*25:46.260- 25:53.680* :  We have refugee artists, we have Malawi and artists, and we also have artists from different
*25:53.680- 26:02.320* :  parts of the world that come to share their time. And those are Malawi and artists who came from
*26:02.320- 26:08.660* :  South Africa, a DJ from Italy, and Malawi and traditional dancers all together.
*26:09.480- 26:13.740* :  And so what can attendees at these years to manifestable expect?
*26:14.960- 26:22.180* :  This year we are celebrating our 10th anniversary, and we are planning a big celebration
*26:22.180- 26:31.240* :  and of course trying to bring probably a bigger name of African artists because most of the time
*26:31.240- 26:38.760* :  we give spotlights to the Malawi and Adliners. And this year we are trying our best if the means
*26:38.760- 26:48.280* :  who allow us to bring a big Adliner from the continent. But for me when I do, when the festival
*26:48.280- 26:53.180* :  I say the highlight of the festival is not the artist, the highlight of the festival is the
*26:53.180- 26:59.720* :  cause because we shouldn't forget that the festival is to give a voice to refugees and to make
*26:59.720- 27:07.220* :  sure that refugees are seen and appreciated. So Trezo, I wonder if any of the artists that have come
*27:07.220- 27:12.740* :  through or the works that you have shown has gone on to gain bigger fame?
*27:14.000- 27:21.340* :  I would say in the past 10 years, the impact has been very big. First of all, before to my
*27:21.340- 27:26.900* :  manifestable Zalai Karishuji Campo, the hidden place that's no one knew about. To my
*27:26.900- 27:36.040* :  knee has given spotlights where people go to see, to discover, to meet people, and apart from that,
*27:36.520- 27:41.220* :  people go outside the refugee camp, they talk in their houses, they talk to their friends. So we
*27:41.220- 27:46.800* :  have created a big movement of Malawians that are now becoming refugee advocates or refugee
*27:46.800- 27:52.980* :  champions because they have experienced living, enjoying life together with refugees. Today,
*27:52.980- 27:59.900* :  we see a lot of refugee artists being booked in different shows around Malawi or collaborating
*27:59.900- 28:06.600* :  with Malawians, celebrities, refugee dancers being featured in Malawian music videos,
*28:06.600- 28:09.080* :  actors being featured in Malawian films.
*28:18.600- 28:23.580* :  So I would say that's to my knee has had a lot of benefit, not only on artists, but
*28:24.060- 28:28.260* :  on refugee advocacy and even on the Malawian tourism.
*28:32.980- 28:37.240* :  Through Zalim Pony there, and to hear more about the festival, check out to my knee on the
*28:37.240- 28:42.740* :  BBCWorldService.com, slash the documentary, or search for the documentary wherever you get
*28:42.740- 28:49.660* :  your BBC podcasts. The James Webb Space Telescope was only launched into orbit a couple of years ago
*28:49.660- 28:55.000* :  as a successor to the Hubble Telescope, but already it's sent back amazing images,
*28:55.500- 29:01.100* :  and it's starting to redefine our view of the early universe. Scientists have been studying
*29:01.100- 29:07.420* :  a galaxy, which is one of the youngest and most distant ever observed, to try to figure out
*29:07.420- 29:13.300* :  why it's so bright. Catherine Heyman, the astronomer Royal for Scotland and Professor of
*29:13.300- 29:17.640* :  Astrophysics at the University of Edinburgh, told us more about this galaxy.
*29:18.600- 29:27.800* :  It has a snazzy name, GNZ11. Now we are seeing this galaxy as it was just 400 million years
*29:27.800- 29:32.900* :  after the Big Bang, and in human terms, 400 million years sounds like an awful long time,
*29:33.380- 29:39.760* :  but in the age of the universe, which is 13.8 billion years old, we are seeing this galaxy
*29:39.820- 29:46.960* :  as it was in the very, very early universe. And new results from astronomers in Cambridge
*29:47.620- 29:55.900* :  are showing tentative signs of that it's seen the elusive population three stars. So this is
*29:55.900- 30:03.740* :  another interesting discovery from the James Webb Space Telescope. It is finding in the very
*30:03.740- 30:09.760* :  early universe that we have really quite massive galaxies that weren't expected. There's very
*30:09.760- 30:14.720* :  interesting things, this telescope was designed to look at the very first stars in galaxies in
*30:14.720- 30:20.180* :  the universe, and it is giving us these results. But it's also giving us unexpected results.
*30:20.820- 30:27.060* :  How has there been enough time for these very massive galaxies to form? And so it's incredibly
*30:27.060- 30:32.280* :  cited. This was just launched on Christmas Day in 2021. So it is a brand new piece of kit
*30:32.700- 30:37.780* :  for astronomers. We're incredibly excited about what it's going to find. This is just one galaxy.
*30:38.220- 30:44.520* :  So the next step is to look at even more to see, is this a rare unusual effect? Or are there
*30:44.520- 30:48.980* :  lots of galaxies like this? Can we find more evidence for these elusive
*30:49.400- 30:52.400* :  population three stars? The very, very first stars in our galaxy.
*30:53.240- 31:00.320* :  Professor Catherine Havens. Now, if you're a fan of Jane Austen, you might remember this scene.
*31:02.220- 31:08.280* :  Mr. Dars.
*31:11.340- 31:15.720* :  Miss Bennett. That was a moment when actor Colin Firth
*31:15.720- 31:23.220* :  strode out of her lake with his soaking wet shirt clinging to him in the BBC's 1995 adaptation
*31:23.220- 31:30.100* :  of pride and prejudice, causing millions of viewers around the world to swoon. Now that same
*31:30.100- 31:36.260* :  shirt is going up for sale and it's expected to fetch more than $12,000. It's one of more than
*31:36.260- 31:41.720* :  60 costumes from film and television being auctioned here in London with a proceeds going to charity.
*31:42.240- 31:47.620* :  Diana Colin was a costume designer for the Pride and Prejudice series. She says a lot of thought
*31:47.620- 31:53.620* :  went into Colin Firth's outfit for that particular scene. It actually, as far as I remember,
*31:53.740- 32:01.240* :  30-odd years ago that it was actually unscripted. So I was asked by the producer,
*32:01.240- 32:08.380* :  or director, as I'm in London, or super, or producer, to work this out because they wanted him
*32:08.380- 32:15.180* :  to come from the lake, which you can see in front of the house while she's walking by,
*32:15.180- 32:23.660* :  as it turned out, as a surprise. So Christopher Prince, who ran the men's costume,
*32:23.660- 32:29.100* :  at Cosbrook, we had chats about it, and then it was quite clear that arts and entertainment,
*32:29.100- 32:36.400* :  the American company, who were part of the funding for with the BBC for Pride and Prejudice,
*32:36.660- 32:42.740* :  were very keen that it should be very discreet. We shouldn't have any evidence of Colin's
*32:43.000- 32:51.460* :  full physical. So we devised some underwear, which in the event I think was never really seen.
*32:52.140- 32:58.940* :  I think we had to assume that he'd gone in his bridges and the shirts. Yes, and they are
*32:58.940- 33:06.860* :  actually in the real, in the end of the, in the 18th century. They are very long so that you can
*33:06.860- 33:13.480* :  tuck the front and back tails between your legs as a man. You don't wear pants as such.
*33:14.320- 33:19.440* :  Diner Colin, with that interesting insight into costume design for the Pride and Prejudice series.
*33:22.040- 33:26.140* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
