*01:19.580- 01:20.780* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:20.780- 01:24.740* :  We're recording this at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 25th of March.
*01:25.420- 01:30.760* :  France warns Russia not to use the Islamist massacre in Moscow as an excuse to step up attacks
*01:30.760- 01:31.480* :  on Ukraine.
*01:32.380- 01:36.760* :  In the first use of its new law on big tech, the European Commission begins an investigation
*01:36.760- 01:39.020* :  into Apple, Alphabet and Meta.
*01:39.900- 01:43.440* :  And scientists in Switzerland try to find so-called ghost particles.
*01:45.920- 01:50.740* :  So in the podcast, the start impact of mobile phones on young people.
*01:50.980- 01:56.360* :  The phone basically changed developmental pathways, robbed kids of the many hours of intense
*01:56.360- 02:00.800* :  play and laughter and gossip and fun together that they used to have.
*02:07.100- 02:12.080* :  But first, even as Russia tries to link Ukraine to the devastating assault on a Moscow
*02:12.080- 02:17.400* :  concert hall on Friday, France has joined the US in saying that intelligence shows Islamic
*02:17.400- 02:18.900* :  state was to blame.
*02:19.480- 02:25.360* :  At least 137 people were killed, exposing a huge security failing in the heart of Russia.
*02:25.460- 02:30.860* :  Less than a week after President Putin was re-elected, IS has claimed responsibility, but
*02:30.860- 02:32.460* :  the Kremlin has refused to comment.
*02:32.720- 02:37.860* :  The French president, Emmanuel Macron, says Russia must not try to use the massacre as
*02:37.860- 02:39.880* :  an excuse to step up attacks on Ukraine.
*02:40.760- 02:43.560* :  It must be kept from all instrumentalisation or deformation.
*02:44.480- 02:49.780* :  While most avoid instrumentalising this, there is an ongoing war of aggression that we
*02:49.780- 02:54.620* :  have condemned, that we oppose profoundly, and that has led us to take sanctions against
*02:54.620- 02:56.920* :  Russia and support Ukraine.
*02:57.600- 03:03.660* :  I think it would be both cynical and counterproductive for Russia and the safety of its citizens
*03:04.080- 03:07.800* :  to use this context and turn it against Ukraine.
*03:11.380- 03:17.120* :  The suspected gunmen from Tajikistan were paraded in front of the cameras at a series
*03:17.120- 03:20.300* :  of late-night court hearings looking battered and bruised.
*03:21.960- 03:26.380* :  In accordance with Article 100 and date of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation,
*03:26.500- 03:32.300* :  this court has ruled that Mohamed Sabia Faisal be placed in custody for one month and
*03:32.300- 03:37.000* :  28 days, in other words, until May 22, 2024.
*03:38.460- 03:41.540* :  The Kremlin has remained silent on claims the men were tortured.
*03:41.540- 03:45.420* :  I heard more about their condition from our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg.
*03:45.760- 03:49.620* :  From the video from the court, it looked as if they had been beaten.
*03:50.200- 03:57.100* :  I mean, two of the men had black eyes, one very swollen face, one of the men was brought
*03:57.100- 04:02.120* :  in, wheeled into the courtroom in a wheelchair, in a hospital gown, at one point he looked
*04:02.120- 04:03.800* :  as if he was going to lose consciousness.
*04:05.160- 04:12.040* :  As regards the latest figures for the death toll, that stands at 137 people killed in that
*04:12.040- 04:13.340* :  brutal attack on Friday.
*04:14.020- 04:18.000* :  But officials are warning that that may not be the final death toll that the figures could
*04:18.000- 04:18.340* :  rise.
*04:18.860- 04:21.900* :  And what is the reaction in Russia three days on?
*04:21.900- 04:26.200* :  I see that they're recalled for the lifting of the moratorium on the death penalty.
*04:26.620- 04:27.780* :  Yes, there have been those calls.
*04:27.880- 04:32.300* :  In fact, you know, I was there outside Kroka City Hall yesterday on the National Day
*04:32.300- 04:32.700* :  of Morning.
*04:32.780- 04:35.160* :  There were lots of people who'd come to lay flowers.
*04:35.160- 04:39.260* :  And I spoke to one man who was queuing up with some rosers to lay.
*04:39.900- 04:45.140* :  And he said to me, whoever did this, whoever was behind this, bring back the death penalty.
*04:45.140- 04:49.600* :  He said, lift the moratorium on the death penalty, at least for terrorists, because why
*04:49.600- 04:52.940* :  should we have to feed these people for the rest of their lives in prison?
*04:53.780- 04:55.000* :  And he was, he's not alone.
*04:55.160- 05:00.100* :  There have been quite a few calls, including from people in the Russian Parliament, to lift
*05:00.100- 05:02.080* :  the moratorium on the death penalty.
*05:02.600- 05:05.460* :  And I think it's possible that that could happen.
*05:06.000- 05:09.400* :  What are relations like with Tajikistan?
*05:09.400- 05:12.520* :  And what is, what do you make of the link with that country?
*05:15.480- 05:19.820* :  Well, interestingly, Valima Putin, I think a couple of days ago, had a telephone conversation
*05:19.860- 05:21.640* :  with the president of Tajikistan.
*05:23.080- 05:27.940* :  There will be concern about possible terror links with Central Asia.
*05:28.400- 05:32.860* :  And I think what we're going to see as a result of this attack, we're going to see more
*05:32.860- 05:38.020* :  pressure in Russian society being put on migrants, coming from Central Asia to Russia.
*05:38.020- 05:39.700* :  I think that's almost inevitable.
*05:39.700- 05:41.780* :  That's going to be one of the consequences, I think.
*05:42.380- 05:48.120* :  One of the Russian papers today suggested that every time there was a terrorist attack in
*05:48.120- 05:50.620* :  Russia, it said, there was a crackdown.
*05:50.740- 05:52.400* :  There was a tightening of the screws.
*05:52.940- 05:54.860* :  Sometimes those screws are political ones.
*05:55.380- 05:57.520* :  We don't know which screws will be tightened this time around.
*05:57.940- 06:01.060* :  Steve Rosenberg, our Russia editor, talking to me, from Moscow.
*06:01.920- 06:07.040* :  In the aftermath of Friday's attack, US officials say that so-called Islamic State still poses
*06:07.040- 06:12.380* :  a global threat, and let's believe that the most likely perpetrator is the branch based
*06:12.380- 06:15.440* :  in Afghanistan, which has lately stepped up its activity.
*06:16.120- 06:19.120* :  So if ISIS is responsible, why would it target Russia?
*06:19.120- 06:23.020* :  Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, has been talking to Nigel Adely.
*06:23.720- 06:26.020* :  There are a number of reasons, Syria, for one.
*06:26.360- 06:32.020* :  So a recent ISIS message was, along the lines of, we never forgive and forget.
*06:32.360- 06:33.040* :  We will get even.
*06:33.660- 06:39.260* :  And IS fighters in Syria have taken a massive pounding from the Russian Air Force.
*06:39.820- 06:42.760* :  So they've got schools to settle as far as that concerned there.
*06:43.520- 06:48.720* :  Then there's Afghanistan, where it may surprise listeners to hear this, but the Taliban and
*06:48.720- 06:49.940* :  ISIS are not friends.
*06:50.480- 06:51.700* :  In fact, they are mortal enemies.
*06:52.400- 07:01.000* :  So after August 2021, when there was that horrendous chaotic withdrawal from Kabul, the insurgency
*07:01.000- 07:03.620* :  then became an ISIS insurgency.
*07:04.240- 07:09.560* :  And if you remember, there was a horrific bomb at the airport that killed schools of civilians,
*07:09.960- 07:12.680* :  and I think about 13 US or servicemen.
*07:13.340- 07:13.940* :  That was ISIS.
*07:14.020- 07:18.940* :  That was the Khurasan branch of Islamic State.
*07:18.940- 07:24.960* :  Khurasan being a kind of historic Islamic reference to an area in Islamic history that
*07:24.960- 07:30.100* :  roughly spans Afghanistan, parts of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan.
*07:30.980- 07:34.900* :  IS view the Taliban as being friends with the Russians.
*07:34.900- 07:38.260* :  And they attacked the Russian embassy in Kabul in September 2022.
*07:39.020- 07:45.460* :  The third reason why it might be them wanting to attack Russia is the crackdown recently
*07:45.500- 07:50.080* :  on suspected jihadists and other Muslims inside Russia.
*07:50.380- 07:55.660* :  I mean, the large number of Muslim workers in Russia, mostly from former Soviet states,
*07:56.100- 07:58.860* :  like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and so on.
*07:59.500- 08:05.640* :  And judging by the ease with which this attack took place, where they were able to get powerful
*08:05.640- 08:12.220* :  automatic weapons inside a theater, unopposed, unchecked, it makes you think, well, you know,
*08:12.720- 08:13.520* :  it can't have been too difficult.
*08:13.520- 08:15.420* :  This was a target of opportunity for ISIS.
*08:16.120- 08:17.860* :  And what does it tell us about the resurgence?
*08:17.940- 08:23.480* :  If it is an apparent resurgence of ISIS, because as far as global geopolitics is concerned,
*08:23.480- 08:29.140* :  they seem to have been a great threat at some stages, and then they are apparently put down
*08:29.140- 08:31.500* :  and then maybe they come back again somewhere else.
*08:32.480- 08:35.980* :  Most Western governments and most people will be hoping that this is just a temporary blip.
*08:36.240- 08:39.340* :  ISIS lost their physical caliphate some years ago.
*08:39.940- 08:43.440* :  They are pretty active still in parts of Africa.
*08:43.960- 08:45.100* :  That's where they are strongest.
*08:45.100- 08:50.580* :  That's their new theater of jihad, primarily, in North West Africa, in northern Mozambique.
*08:51.000- 08:52.620* :  They've got various branches there.
*08:53.400- 08:57.480* :  But in Europe, they haven't been massively active recently.
*08:57.540- 09:03.060* :  There are still ISIS-inspired plots that are being intercepted by Britain's MI5, for example.
*09:04.060- 09:08.860* :  But we're not in the same place that we were in 2015, when they did the butterfly raid,
*09:08.860- 09:12.560* :  for example, in Paris, which was a massive attack.
*09:13.380- 09:15.180* :  The terrorist threat never went completely away.
*09:15.780- 09:24.740* :  And the horrific death toll in the Middle East in Gaza has, in terms of Muslim sentiment
*09:24.740- 09:28.580* :  at street level, it's still boiling with anger at that.
*09:28.580- 09:35.420* :  And that makes it easier for jihadist groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda to recruit people
*09:35.420- 09:36.200* :  to their cause.
*09:36.820- 09:39.000* :  Thank God, now, our security correspondent.
*09:40.260- 09:45.260* :  Physicists have long suspected that mysterious ghost particles in the world around us could
*09:45.260- 09:47.840* :  help our understanding of the true nature of the universe.
*09:48.360- 09:54.180* :  Now Europe's center for particle research, Surn in Switzerland, has approved a $120 million
*09:54.180- 09:57.380* :  experiment to try to prove whether or not they exist.
*09:57.380- 09:59.820* :  Here's our science correspondent, Palabgosh.
*10:00.480- 10:05.240* :  Subatomic particles make up atoms that, in turn, make up the world around us.
*10:05.820- 10:10.700* :  But the biggest problem in physics at the moment is that the ones we know about account for
*10:10.700- 10:13.720* :  only 5% of what the universe is made of.
*10:14.300- 10:17.880* :  Particle accelerators have been searching for the remainder for many years.
*10:18.760- 10:22.440* :  Now, a team at Surn is trying a slightly different approach.
*10:23.020- 10:28.900* :  It's investigating whether some or all of the missing 95% might be ghostly versions
*10:28.900- 10:33.620* :  of the particles they already know about, in that they interact only occasionally with
*10:33.620- 10:34.160* :  our world.
*10:35.000- 10:40.260* :  The scientists plan to smash many more particles together in the accelerator to increase their
*10:40.260- 10:45.940* :  chances of creating the ghosts, which they hope to detect, using a new instrument that's
*10:45.940- 10:49.120* :  a thousand times more sensitive than previous versions.
*10:49.600- 10:50.400* :  Palabgosh.
*10:51.120- 10:56.380* :  The captain of a British warship in the Red Sea has told the BBC that attacks on shipping
*10:56.380- 11:00.860* :  are becoming harder to defend against as the Houthis launch more ballistic and cruise
*11:01.440- 11:01.460* :  missiles.
*11:01.540- 11:06.460* :  The group which controls much of Yemen says it's targeting merchant vessels and warships
*11:06.460- 11:09.080* :  in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.
*11:09.580- 11:13.480* :  Our Defence Correspondent Jonathan Beal is the first journalist to join the destroyer
*11:13.480- 11:16.440* :  HMS Diamond on its current mission in the Red Sea.
*11:18.080- 11:23.780* :  The Royal Navy destroyer HMS Diamond, sailing in the Red Sea towards troubled waters.
*11:24.680- 11:29.780* :  They're here to protect merchant shipping, and for this mission, to escort a naval task
*11:29.780- 11:34.800* :  group, traveling south to the Indian Ocean, charting their course is left to an Josh
*11:34.860- 11:35.380* :  Tirey.
*11:35.560- 11:40.220* :  There's a regular sort of drumbeat of drone activity, as well as missile firing, etc. throughout
*11:40.220- 11:44.260* :  this region, which is why it is a high threat area, so there's a good possibility that
*11:44.260- 11:45.780* :  those all occur during the transit.
*11:46.480- 11:51.800* :  Over night we have moved from the medium threat to the high threat area, just going to be
*11:51.800- 11:57.000* :  a sense of the dangers that I had overnight, a merchant vessel was hit by a missile.
*11:58.680- 12:03.540* :  Assessment is further raised from ballistic or anti-sync drones, missiles are likely.
*12:03.920- 12:08.300* :  In the operations room, they've already donned fire protective clothing. With their powerful
*12:08.300- 12:13.520* :  radar, they can track multiple objects from hundreds of miles away, and this is what happens
*12:13.520- 12:15.060* :  when they identify a threat.
*12:21.940- 12:24.200* :  The drills they rehearsed many times before.
*12:32.260- 12:33.800* :  But now it's deadly serious.
*12:34.660- 12:39.960* :  This one of two occasions we witnessed, when the Houthis fire ballistic missiles, traveling
*12:47.100- 12:48.300* :  at more than three times the speed of sound.
*12:48.480- 12:53.440* :  The relief as Lieutenant Commander Martin Harris tracks it, splashing into the sea, well
*13:01.680- 13:02.420* :  out of range.
*13:03.060- 13:05.100* :  Houthis drones are the other danger.
*13:05.100- 13:10.460* :  In the early morning, they identify a ground station sending a signal to drones flying
*13:10.960- 13:11.960* :  or UAVs.
*13:12.020- 13:16.740* :  He's now got two airborne in the north, we anticipate they may come south, but we need
*13:16.820- 13:18.520* :  to monitor that on radar and see what happens.
*13:18.960- 13:25.160* :  So they just said that there is a drone, a UAV, close by, they're now keeping an eye
*13:25.160- 13:29.300* :  on it, they have raised the threat level, everything's wearing anti-flash gear, waiting
*13:29.300- 13:30.720* :  to see where that drone goes.
*13:31.740- 13:39.400* :  It's a potentially deadly version of hide-and-seek, but the drone doesn't spot them.
*13:40.740- 13:45.740* :  This time, Diamond hasn't fired its main sea-viper missiles, but it's already shocked
*13:45.740- 13:49.760* :  down nine drones, seven of them in just one night in January.
*13:51.140- 13:57.180* :  Diamonds Captain believes they have saved lives, but they haven't stopped increasingly sophisticated
*13:57.180- 13:58.200* :  Houthi attacks.
*13:58.620- 14:03.780* :  It seems to me that they're using more advanced and more lethal weapons than they were in
*14:03.780- 14:05.160* :  the earlier parts of the operation.
*14:05.540- 14:10.960* :  Because Diamond is looking out for suspicious activity, they board a Dow, it's declared
*14:10.960- 14:13.400* :  stateless, but it's flying an Iranian flag.
*14:13.800- 14:17.680* :  What that means is the teams on board will be scanning every single compartment looking
*14:17.680- 14:20.360* :  through false bulkheads, looking underneath all of the equipment.
*14:20.420- 14:23.580* :  They carry out a search, but find nothing illegal.
*14:23.620- 14:29.100* :  It's proving just as hard to stem the flow of weapons as to stop the Houthi attacks.
*14:30.460- 14:33.860* :  Jonathan Bill reporting from HMS Diamond in the Red Sea.
*14:34.740- 14:38.780* :  Relations between the Philippines and China have long been strained over disputed waters
*14:38.780- 14:40.340* :  in the South China Sea.
*14:40.760- 14:44.700* :  Now the Philippine government has summoned Beijing's envoy to protest over a confrontation
*14:44.700- 14:49.160* :  involving the Chinese coast guard, as I heard from our Asia-Pacific regional editor,
*14:49.500- 14:50.140* :  Celia Hatton.
*14:50.560- 14:56.800* :  This later-sincident happened on Saturday, but it all centers around a ship that the Philippines
*14:56.800- 15:03.760* :  intentionally ran aground, all the way back in 1999, in a disputed part of the South
*15:03.760- 15:07.140* :  China Sea that both the Philippines and China lay claim to.
*15:07.140- 15:08.420* :  It's really valuable water.
*15:08.420- 15:11.980* :  It's got suspected oil and gas deposits, lots of fish there.
*15:12.400- 15:13.680* :  It's close to the Philippines.
*15:13.680- 15:19.680* :  They say that that territory is there, so they ran the ship, World War II era ship aground,
*15:19.740- 15:25.260* :  and ever since then they've had the Navy stationed aboard this ship in order to sort of lay claim
*15:25.260- 15:30.900* :  to what they say is their territory, but every six weeks or so they have to run new supplies
*15:30.900- 15:31.680* :  to the ship.
*15:32.140- 15:37.560* :  Now, China also claims that territory, and increasingly every time there's a resupply
*15:37.560- 15:43.340* :  mission, the last one happened on Saturday, the Chinese coast guard tries to really get
*15:43.340- 15:45.080* :  in the way of the Philippine Navy.
*15:45.080- 15:49.620* :  And in this last incident, China aimed water cannon at the Philippine ship.
*15:49.620- 15:53.400* :  They said that the Philippines had entered their territory and they were within their right
*15:53.400- 15:54.020* :  to do so.
*15:54.020- 15:57.580* :  They entered three Philippine soldiers in doing so.
*15:57.920- 16:02.480* :  So this is upset, Manila, so much actually we just found out from the Chinese side that
*16:02.480- 16:07.440* :  the foreign ministers from the two countries have consulted over what's happened.
*16:07.720- 16:14.100* :  Yeah, apparently the Chinese vice foreign minister said that the Philippines must act cautiously
*16:14.100- 16:17.080* :  in which way to go and that relations are at a crossroads.
*16:17.080- 16:19.760* :  It sounds like some quite tough talking from China.
*16:20.360- 16:20.920* :  Yeah, that's right.
*16:20.920- 16:26.000* :  I mean, look, there's concerns on both sides really and from the United States that these
*16:26.000- 16:30.020* :  confrontations that have been happening every month, every six weeks or so are at risk
*16:30.020- 16:31.740* :  of really spinning out of control.
*16:32.160- 16:36.260* :  The Philippines over the past couple of years has really tightened its relationship with
*16:36.260- 16:37.000* :  the United States.
*16:37.000- 16:42.840* :  The two countries have reaffirmed a defense treaty that the U.S. will come to the aid of
*16:42.840- 16:47.820* :  the Philippines in case of any confrontation in the South China Sea, even if it doesn't
*16:47.820- 16:48.800* :  involve the military.
*16:49.320- 16:54.040* :  And so that's really ramped up the stakes that this could lead to a full-brown confrontation
*16:54.200- 16:56.480* :  and that's why the diplomats are talking today.
*16:56.780- 16:59.020* :  Aja, Pacific Regional Editor, Celia Hatton.
*17:01.040- 17:02.200* :  Still to come on this podcast?
*17:02.360- 17:05.860* :  You can call it ethnic cleansing if you want to call it apartheid.
*17:06.280- 17:07.700* :  You choose your definition.
*17:08.380- 17:11.280* :  I choose the way to protect the state of Israel.
*17:11.800- 17:15.160* :  The Israeli settlers wanting to move back to Gaza.
*17:22.780- 17:24.660* :  Water used as a weapon of war.
*17:24.880- 17:29.400* :  In none of these villages, there was any piped, clean water for people.
*17:29.580- 17:31.640* :  A nation in the grip of criminal gangs.
*17:31.660- 17:35.980* :  How bad does it have to get before the international community reacts?
*17:36.400- 17:38.420* :  A country showing signs of fracture.
*17:38.620- 17:39.660* :  Right now it's done.
*17:40.160- 17:41.500* :  Things are really quite dark.
*17:41.520- 17:42.780* :  The nation is divided.
*17:42.780- 17:44.860* :  The mistrusts are so deep.
*17:45.180- 17:49.180* :  The global jigsaw from the BBC World Service is back for a new series.
*17:49.700- 17:54.280* :  Listen now by searching for the explanation, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:58.620- 18:04.300* :  In its first investigation under a new law designed to curb the power of big tech, the European
*18:04.300- 18:09.560* :  Commission is to look into alleged uncompetitive practices at Apple, the Google owner, Alphabet
*18:09.760- 18:10.460* :  and Meta.
*18:11.020- 18:15.100* :  Regulators will examine whether there have been any breaches of the Digital Markets Act
*18:15.100- 18:18.800* :  with potential fines of up to 10% of annual turnover.
*18:19.680- 18:23.060* :  Mugreta Vestea is the EU's anti-trust commissioner.
*18:23.620- 18:30.300* :  We will do our best to investigate with due process and all the necessary respect for
*18:30.300- 18:33.160* :  the companies that we investigate as fast as possible.
*18:33.760- 18:36.480* :  It's not that we will wait for a month and only then.
*18:36.920- 18:40.800* :  Now, as soon as we have results, of course, we will take decisions.
*18:41.340- 18:44.360* :  We hear more from technology journalist Chris Stoker-Walker.
*18:44.720- 18:50.760* :  So essentially Apple is accused of charging fees that would lock people into their App Store
*18:51.300- 18:53.280* :  and obviously Apple takes a cut from that.
*18:53.280- 18:58.440* :  Likewise, Google parent company Alphabet is accused of essentially doing the same sort
*18:58.440- 19:03.120* :  of thing with their Google Play Store, which is their equivalent of the App Store and
*19:03.120- 19:07.700* :  also prioritising certain things within their search engine.
*19:07.760- 19:13.500* :  So obviously, Digital Markets Act was designed to try and stop so-called gatekeepers from exerting
*19:13.980- 19:15.000* :  monopolistic power.
*19:15.360- 19:19.000* :  Obviously, the companies involved say that they don't do that, but European regulators
*19:19.000- 19:22.140* :  have got pretty tough talking on these companies of late.
*19:22.560- 19:28.240* :  The European Union has long been keen to try and rein in big tech supremacy, but we have
*19:28.240- 19:29.640* :  seen this happening worldwide.
*19:29.640- 19:34.920* :  It just so happens that European regulators have been quickest off the draw and have
*19:34.920- 19:39.280* :  kind of gained a reputation, I suppose, for establishing global standards.
*19:39.600- 19:43.900* :  I think we're starting to see the ramifications of maybe 20 years of big tech dominance
*19:43.900- 19:48.700* :  and politicians realising that actually some good did come of that, but also some bad
*19:48.700- 19:49.000* :  up.
*19:49.300- 19:52.320* :  And obviously, Apple is one of the key people that are being targeted here.
*19:52.320- 19:56.920* :  They take a decent chunk of any salesmaid through the App Store, so the idea is you
*19:56.920- 19:58.800* :  could see competitors taking lesser with them.
*19:58.800- 20:02.260* :  Obviously, do you expect to fight from the companies to stop this?
*20:02.560- 20:04.200* :  Journalist Chris Stoke Walker.
*20:04.940- 20:09.640* :  Next to the Middle East, and despite the fact that war is raging in Gaza, there have
*20:09.640- 20:15.120* :  been calls from the far right in Israel for Jewish settlers to return to the territory.
*20:15.700- 20:20.980* :  According to the Israeli government, more than 9,000 people in 25 settlements were evicted
*20:20.980- 20:23.140* :  from Gaza in 2005.
*20:23.800- 20:28.560* :  The suggestion that settlers go back there has support from ministers in Israel's hard
*20:28.560- 20:33.040* :  right government, including the minister for public security, Itamar Ben-Govir.
*20:33.580- 20:37.800* :  Settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes that.
*20:38.240- 20:43.420* :  There are 700,000 Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
*20:44.040- 20:47.760* :  Our senior international correspondent, Uligerin, reports from the West Bank.
*20:48.200- 20:55.720* :  The hills of the West Bank, Palestinian land, eaten away for decades by illegal Israeli
*20:55.720- 20:56.360* :  settlements.
*20:56.380- 20:59.660* :  They are an obstacle to peace, the UN says.
*21:00.240- 21:05.540* :  But now many on Israel's far right want to bring settlements back to Gaza.
*21:06.220- 21:12.400* :  Like Yehuda Shimon, who has raised 10 children in this settler outpost in the West Bank,
*21:13.520- 21:18.660* :  he lived in Gaza in the past and claims a God-given right to return.
*21:18.660- 21:26.900* :  It's part of Israel area, this is the land the God gave us, a new couldn't go to God
*21:26.900- 21:31.700* :  and told him, okay, you give me, I give other people, no.
*21:32.000- 21:38.740* :  These are the 21 Gaza settlements that were demolished in 2005.
*21:39.480- 21:45.800* :  But Daniela Weiss is already mapping out a new Gaza, without the more than 2 million
*21:45.800- 21:47.820* :  Palestinians who live there.
*21:48.700- 21:52.820* :  The 78-year-old is the grandmother of Israel's settler movement.
*21:53.960- 22:00.160* :  Gaza Arabs will not stay in the Gaza Strip, who will stay Jews.
*22:00.900- 22:07.180* :  The world will absorb the people of Gaza, how we do it, we encourage it.
*22:07.620- 22:12.420* :  Palestinians and Gaza, who wish to remain in Gaza, are you saying they should be forced
*22:12.720- 22:13.080* :  to go?
*22:13.820- 22:22.680* :  Palestinians in Gaza, the good ones, will be enabled, I'm not saying forth, I say, enabled
*22:22.680- 22:29.280* :  because they want to go, if they don't want to go, if they don't want to go, if they
*22:29.280- 22:32.320* :  don't want to go, if they don't, what happens?
*22:32.840- 22:36.540* :  Normal people don't want to live in hell.
*22:37.020- 22:40.620* :  What you're talking about sounds like a plan for ethnic cleansing.
*22:41.940- 22:46.320* :  You can call it ethnic cleansing, you can call it refugees, whatever you want.
*22:46.320- 22:52.200* :  If you want to call it cleansing, if you want to call it apartheid, you choose your definition.
*22:52.940- 22:55.860* :  I choose the way to protect the state of Israel.
*22:56.260- 23:03.420* :  Also embracing a return to Gaza, itamar Ben Gveer, Israel's far-right security minister,
*23:03.840- 23:04.960* :  a settler himself.
*23:05.940- 23:12.700* :  He was among about a dozen ministers at this conference entitled settlement bring security.
*23:15.680- 23:17.820* :  It's time to go back home, he says.
*23:18.520- 23:21.540* :  It's time to return to the land of Israel.
*23:22.500- 23:29.180* :  First Israelis oppose going back to Gaza, but since the Hamas attacks on October 7th,
*23:29.600- 23:31.940* :  it is being talked about out loud.
*23:32.400- 23:38.920* :  And some already have their eyes on prime real estate in the utter devastation of Gaza,
*23:39.620- 23:44.800* :  where the death toll among Palestinians is 32,000 and counting.
*23:45.600- 23:50.940* :  I have friends in Tel Aviv, so they say, don't forget to keep for me a plot near the coast
*23:51.220- 23:57.360* :  in Gaza, because it's a beautiful, beautiful coast, beautiful golden, beautiful place.
*23:58.200- 24:05.560* :  It's beautiful no more, after almost six months of Israeli bombardment, Jewish settlers
*24:05.560- 24:10.980* :  may never get to the beachfront, but much of Gaza has already been erased.
*24:11.700- 24:13.320* :  They're report by Ola Garin.
*24:13.840- 24:18.300* :  Ecuador's youngest mayor, Brigitte Garcia, and the member of her staff, have been found
*24:18.300- 24:19.700* :  shot dead in a car.
*24:20.160- 24:24.400* :  Police say they are investigating the deaths, which have prompted a wave of outrage as the
*24:24.400- 24:27.920* :  once-peaceful nation battles violent crime and drug trafficking.
*24:28.340- 24:29.360* :  Here's Stephanie Prentice.
*24:29.960- 24:35.000* :  Police in Ecuador say they found the bodies of San Vicente Mayor Brigitte Garcia, and her
*24:35.000- 24:40.200* :  communications director, Hyro Law, early on Sunday, inside a rental car, with both
*24:40.200- 24:41.940* :  having suffered gunshot wounds.
*24:42.680- 24:47.400* :  Later analysis suggested that the shots were not fired from outside of the vehicle, but
*24:47.400- 24:52.700* :  from the inside, and authorities, and are tracking its GPS system to try and piece together
*24:53.020- 24:53.500* :  what happened.
*24:54.140- 24:59.300* :  Brigitte Garcia, belonged to former President Rafael Correa's citizen revolution party.
*24:59.880- 25:05.400* :  The death calls outrage with her political ally, Luis Agonzález, posting, nobody is
*25:05.400- 25:07.340* :  safe in Ecuador, nobody.
*25:08.180- 25:13.080* :  The 27-year-old is the latest political figure in the country to be killed, following the
*25:13.080- 25:17.700* :  assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Vievesencio last August.
*25:18.160- 25:23.160* :  The anti-corruption campaigner was a vocal critic of organized crime, and was shot while
*25:23.160- 25:24.620* :  leaving a campaign event.
*25:25.060- 25:30.780* :  Crime-related violence has surged in Ecuador in recent years, fuel by Colombian and Mexican
*25:30.780- 25:32.040* :  drug cartels.
*25:32.540- 25:37.740* :  The country is currently in a formal state of emergency for a third month, after a spike
*25:37.740- 25:43.180* :  in violence that saw armed men invade a live TV broadcast, and President Daniel Neboa
*25:43.180- 25:45.860* :  has described it as in a state of war.
*25:46.480- 25:51.740* :  The government has been trying to regain order with their Phoenix plan, which has seen 12,000
*25:51.740- 25:57.700* :  arrests and 65 tons of drugs since January, but in a statement said it would reinforce
*25:57.700- 26:01.500* :  security controls following the news of Miss Garcia's assassination.
*26:02.040- 26:02.940* :  Stephanie Prentice
*26:03.980- 26:08.880* :  For many children going through adolescence today, smartphones are ever present, but
*26:08.880- 26:13.060* :  we're only just beginning to understand the effect of this technology on their development
*26:13.060- 26:14.220* :  and mental health.
*26:14.680- 26:19.260* :  A report revealed last week that happiness, among 15 to 24-year-olds in North America,
*26:19.640- 26:20.860* :  has fallen sharply.
*26:21.400- 26:27.160* :  So could smartphones be to blame for making teenagers more depressed, isolated and less tolerant?
*26:27.800- 26:32.740* :  Jonathan Height, social psychologist and author of The Anxious Generation, told Justin
*26:32.740- 26:35.920* :  Web that phones have changed everything for young people.
*26:36.600- 26:41.780* :  It's the complete transformation of childhood that took place between 2010 and 2015, so that
*26:42.100- 26:46.660* :  before then, hardly any kids had a smartphone, they didn't have high-speed data plans, they
*26:46.660- 26:47.880* :  had to pay for their texts.
*26:48.380- 26:53.180* :  So you couldn't really be online for six hours a day before 2010, you had a flip phone.
*26:53.240- 26:55.000* :  By 2015, everything's changed.
*26:55.240- 26:59.020* :  The great majority have a smartphone with a high-speed data plan, they have an Instagram
*26:59.020- 26:59.420* :  account.
*26:59.660- 27:04.840* :  They can be on 10 hours a day, human childhood evolved for young people to play, learn
*27:04.840- 27:07.380* :  social skills, learn adult skills, and they used to do that.
*27:07.380- 27:12.400* :  But once we develop this phone-based childhood, it just blocks almost every avenue of development,
*27:12.460- 27:17.480* :  and that's why we see, for boys and for girls, an elbow, a bend in the mental health stats,
*27:17.500- 27:21.440* :  they all begin going north, they all begin going up, up, up the rates of mental illness
*27:21.440- 27:22.620* :  around 2013.
*27:23.020- 27:26.920* :  What's particularly interesting about that is, of course, it is well before COVID and
*27:26.920- 27:31.380* :  well before the lockdowns, which we tend now to talk about as doing a huge amount of
*27:31.380- 27:31.680* :  damage.
*27:31.920- 27:34.660* :  There's some really stunning data just out now.
*27:35.640- 27:38.340* :  Now that we're past COVID, and we have, you know, kids have been in school for a couple
*27:38.340- 27:43.640* :  of years, and what you see is a little increase from COVID, but this is on like a mountain
*27:43.640- 27:48.660* :  range, going up from baseline to the top of Mount Everest, and along the way, just near
*27:48.660- 27:53.440* :  the top, you do see a little spike that's COVID, but Mount Everest is from the phone-based
*27:54.960- 27:54.980* :  childhood.
*27:55.100- 27:55.420* :  It's not from COVID.
*27:55.420- 27:58.160* :  It was COVID didn't leave a lasting mark in anything like the way that transformation
*27:58.160- 27:58.900* :  childhood did.
*27:59.280- 28:06.900* :  Is some of the damage not from phones, but from the wider fact of what the phone culture
*28:06.900- 28:08.940* :  and the social media culture has done?
*28:08.960- 28:14.800* :  In other words, the atomization of life, the loneliness, the fact that you're not seeing
*28:14.800- 28:16.460* :  people face to face so much.
*28:16.800- 28:22.200* :  It is precisely the fact that once a phone comes into a child's life, it will move to
*28:22.200- 28:23.380* :  the center of that life.
*28:23.540- 28:27.500* :  It will attract their eyes for most of the day, and here we include video game controllers
*28:27.500- 28:27.900* :  as well.
*28:28.140- 28:31.440* :  I'm talking about screens that have, that are linked to the internet that are incredibly
*28:31.440- 28:34.580* :  beautiful and gripping and engineered to hold kids' attention.
*28:35.020- 28:37.200* :  Some of the saddest graphs are for survey questions.
*28:37.900- 28:39.940* :  Sometimes I feel that my life has no meaning.
*28:39.940- 28:42.780* :  I feel that there is no purpose to me being here.
*28:42.780- 28:45.800* :  I mean, there are questions like that that are just, they capture this level of despair,
*28:45.800- 28:50.180* :  and those graphs, those numbers, were going down a little bit in the 2010s for the millennials,
*28:50.180- 28:54.640* :  you know, born 1981 to 1995, they have actually pretty good mental health, and it was getting
*28:54.640- 28:55.320* :  slightly better.
*28:55.540- 29:01.080* :  And then when the first member of Gen Z, born 1996, when that first kid got a smartphone
*29:01.080- 29:06.260* :  and an Instagram account and moved her life onto that, that cut off real relationships
*29:06.260- 29:07.060* :  with other kids.
*29:07.060- 29:10.540* :  The young people do not spend much time with other kids anymore.
*29:10.680- 29:14.380* :  For boys, if you want to see your friends, you literally can't go over to their friend's
*29:14.380- 29:16.700* :  house because you can't play video games over at your friend's house.
*29:16.700- 29:20.000* :  You have to go home alone so that you can put on your headset and your controller.
*29:20.280- 29:24.460* :  So yes, it's the fact that the phone basically changed developmental pathways, robbed kids
*29:24.460- 29:30.720* :  of the many hours of intense play and laughter and gossip and fun together that they used
*29:30.760- 29:31.060* :  to have.
*29:31.260- 29:35.720* :  And you've written before about the fragility in individuals that engenders.
*29:36.020- 29:39.420* :  Regility is a big part of this, and so far you and I have been talking only about the
*29:39.420- 29:43.500* :  phone side of things, but what emerged as I wrote the book, as I wrote the anxious generation,
*29:43.660- 29:45.520* :  was really a story with two parts.
*29:45.820- 29:48.980* :  And the first part is the loss of the play-based childhood.
*29:48.980- 29:51.840* :  And that began in the United States in the 1980s.
*29:52.140- 29:55.900* :  I was surprised to learn, actually, written in Canada, you don't have the crime wave that
*29:55.900- 30:00.860* :  we had, but you also locked up your kids, you freaked out, you stopped trusting other
*30:01.300- 30:01.320* :  adults.
*30:01.900- 30:03.600* :  So we don't let our kids out.
*30:03.620- 30:08.260* :  We don't let them have rough and tumble play and unsupervised adventures the way that adults
*30:08.260- 30:11.140* :  and the kids' parents and grandparents always had.
*30:11.440- 30:12.540* :  So it's not just the phones.
*30:12.540- 30:16.780* :  It's that depriving kids of unsupervised pre-play makes them more fragile.
*30:16.780- 30:20.020* :  They're more easily broken by bad experiences.
*30:20.280- 30:26.020* :  A million parents listening, probably more than that, will be saying, all right then, what
*30:26.020- 30:26.420* :  do we do?
*30:26.720- 30:30.980* :  We have to realize the reason why parents, and in the UK, you're way ahead of us both
*30:30.980- 30:32.320* :  in the depth of your problem.
*30:32.340- 30:34.540* :  You give your kids' phones earlier than we do.
*30:34.660- 30:38.860* :  You've had actually higher rates of mental illness than we do, but you're actually finally
*30:38.860- 30:41.200* :  realizing, wait a second, we have to stop this.
*30:41.360- 30:45.780* :  We have to basically rip the smartphone out of the lives, especially of kids up through
*30:45.780- 30:46.600* :  about age 14.
*30:46.600- 30:49.480* :  So what I'm proposing in my book is four simple norms.
*30:49.760- 30:52.540* :  One is delay smartphones until high school.
*30:52.780- 30:58.240* :  So no smartphone till 14, no social media till 16, phone free schools, and much more
*30:58.240- 31:01.440* :  free play independence and responsibility in the real world.
*31:01.680- 31:03.800* :  In the UK, you're already way ahead of us.
*31:03.800- 31:05.560* :  Your government has mandated phone free schools.
*31:05.560- 31:06.340* :  So that's fantastic.
*31:06.460- 31:08.920* :  There's so much evidence that phone free schools are better.
*31:08.940- 31:12.440* :  But the point is, these things are hard to do as one parent.
*31:12.440- 31:16.780* :  If you're the only parent who doesn't give your 11-year-old a smartphone, she comes
*31:16.780- 31:18.280* :  to and says, mom, I'm the only one.
*31:18.300- 31:19.040* :  I'm excluded.
*31:19.360- 31:19.840* :  Nobody else.
*31:20.440- 31:22.300* :  And that breaks our hearts and we give them a phone.
*31:22.300- 31:24.940* :  So this is what's called the collective action problem.
*31:25.120- 31:26.780* :  Each of us would like to not give a phone.
*31:27.020- 31:30.900* :  But as long as no one else is doing the right thing here, then the cost is very high.
*31:30.900- 31:36.880* :  But if we all do it together, if even half of us do it together, then it becomes much easier
*31:36.880- 31:37.600* :  for our kids.
*31:37.620- 31:41.940* :  And especially if we don't just take away the phones or delay the phones, but we give
*31:41.940- 31:44.520* :  them back what they most want, which is each other.
*31:45.140- 31:48.500* :  Give them time in ways that they can just hang out with each other.
*31:48.660- 31:51.100* :  If they're hanging out with a phone, they're on their phones.
*31:51.460- 31:55.060* :  Jonathan Height, social psychologist and author of The Anxious Generation.
*31:57.160- 32:01.280* :  And that's all from us for now, but the Global News podcast will be back very soon.
*32:01.280- 32:05.720* :  This edition was mixed by Dan Erleck and produced by Vanessa Heaney, our editor's Karen
*32:05.720- 32:06.100* :  Martin.
*32:06.500- 32:07.340* :  I'm Oliver Conway.
*32:07.700- 32:08.760* :  Until next time, goodbye.
