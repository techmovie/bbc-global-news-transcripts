*01:08.280- 01:11.660* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:14.420- 01:19.040* :  I'm Rachel Wright and in the early hours of Friday the 8th of March these are our main stories.
*01:19.040- 01:24.580* :  President Biden is expected to announce that he's ordered the US military to set up a port in
*01:24.580- 01:30.460* :  Gaza to get more humanitarian aid into the territory. Gunmen on motorbikes have reportedly
*01:30.460- 01:36.440* :  seized more than 100 school children in Nigeria. The country's second mass kidnapping in a matter of days.
*01:39.360- 01:45.440* :  Also in this podcast, Haiti's main port has suspended all operations as violence escalates
*01:45.440- 01:51.120* :  and criminal gangs consolidate their grip on the capital. We get the latest in the Formula One Red Bull
*01:51.120- 01:57.320* :  saga and we head to Los Alamos, the town in New Mexico made famous by the film Oppenheimer,
*01:57.320- 02:04.500* :  where people are dealing with a conflicted past. It's really easy for us 75 years later to sit
*02:04.920- 02:07.480* :  in self-righteous judgment of decisions that were made.
*02:11.960- 02:17.000* :  We start with reports that President Biden has directed the US military to build a temporary
*02:17.000- 02:23.240* :  port in Gaza to help boost the delivery of humanitarian aid. The United Nations has been warning
*02:23.240- 02:28.660* :  that a quarter of Gaza's population, more than half a million people, are threatened by famine
*02:28.660- 02:34.380* :  after months of Israeli military operations against Hamas. The official announcement is expected
*02:34.380- 02:39.300* :  to come in President Biden's state of the Union address when the President outlines a list
*02:39.300- 02:45.700* :  of policy priorities in front of members of Congress. We'll update you in a later podcast on his speech.
*02:46.400- 02:51.280* :  Tom Bateman, our State Department correspondent in Washington told me why President Biden
*02:51.280- 02:55.440* :  is announcing it now. For more than a week now, the US administration
*02:55.440- 03:01.820* :  right up to President Biden has made their impatience extremely clear very publicly with the
*03:01.820- 03:08.100* :  Israelis about the absolutely disastrous humanitarian situation on the ground. He said from
*03:08.100- 03:12.940* :  last Friday, and it's been repeated almost daily since then, that he regards there being as no
*03:12.940- 03:18.680* :  excuses for why there can't be more aid allowed in. I mean, Israel for its part says it's letting
*03:18.680- 03:24.260* :  aid in via the land crossings, but blames the UN for a failure of distribution. The UN
*03:24.260- 03:29.660* :  blames Israelis for attacking police security that were securing convoys. The upshot of all of
*03:29.660- 03:36.120* :  this is the UN warns that a quarter of the population of Gaza is now on the brink of famine.
*03:36.120- 03:41.260* :  It's absolutely desperate. And so that's why I think we're seeing the UN now turning to an idea
*03:41.260- 03:46.080* :  that had actually been previously discounted about building some kind of emergency port in Gaza.
*03:46.660- 03:51.720* :  So what President Biden will announce tonight in the state of the Union is a seaport that will be
*03:51.720- 03:58.240* :  constructed by the US military off the shore and then floated towards the coast of Gaza.
*03:58.380- 04:04.900* :  The problem is it doesn't answer some very critical questions, which are around, first of all,
*04:05.020- 04:10.400* :  who will be responsible for the temporary causeway whereby the aid will soon be trucked
*04:11.060- 04:17.860* :  from the floating port onto the beach or onto the coast itself, and crucially, who will secure
*04:17.860- 04:23.760* :  the aid supplies once they're on the beach. Remember that horrific incident last week in which more
*04:23.760- 04:28.980* :  than a hundred Palestinians, desperate and hungry, were killed around an A-convoy.
*04:29.440- 04:34.200* :  Palestinians say most of them shot by the Israelis, the Israelis say most of them were killed in a
*04:34.200- 04:39.900* :  stampede. That was a tipping point for the US where they realised that they basically had to do
*04:39.900- 04:45.520* :  more to alleviate this situation. So the announcement of the port, the fact is that it's going to take
*04:45.520- 04:50.600* :  at least a month, possibly up to two months, even to construct it. And has there been any reaction
*04:50.600- 04:56.600* :  from Israel to this news? On the port itself, there has been coordination with the Israelis
*04:56.600- 05:04.480* :  and the US over this because the supplies will be sailed from Cyprus. The Israelis demand to
*05:04.480- 05:10.480* :  screen everything that goes into Gaza in terms of security inspections. So that process will
*05:10.480- 05:17.680* :  happen in Cyprus as the material is loaded onto ships. You know, we had Benny Gantz, remember the
*05:17.680- 05:23.400* :  war cabinet here in Washington earlier this week? I mean, their view is that they are allowing
*05:23.400- 05:31.360* :  enough trucks inside Gaza via land crossings. They say it's up to the UN to distribute it.
*05:31.700- 05:35.540* :  I mean, I think the view from US officials is that that's no longer a sufficient response
*05:35.540- 05:40.540* :  that the Israelis can't wash their hands of distribution once it's inside. They are responsible
*05:40.540- 05:45.480* :  on the ground. And that's why they've been saying that they regard there as being no further excuses
*05:45.480- 05:52.580* :  in that one. Tom Bateman in Washington. Gunman have abducted pupils from a state primary school in
*05:52.580- 05:58.040* :  the northern Nigerian state of Kaduna. Days after dozens of women and children were reportedly
*05:58.040- 06:04.460* :  kidnapped across the country in the state of Borno in the northeast. I went to say that almost 200
*06:04.460- 06:09.980* :  children were taken by armed men. Both events are reported linked to Boko Haram insurgents.
*06:10.340- 06:16.480* :  The BBC's West Africa correspondent Mayany Jones is in Borno state and spoke to the BBC's James
*06:16.480- 06:22.300* :  Menendez. We came to Borno to try and find out more about the abduction that had happened
*06:22.300- 06:27.740* :  earlier this week and a news started to break that across the country in the northwest of Nigerian.
*06:27.740- 06:32.980* :  Kaduna, there'd been another mass abduction. This time it's in a school. It's a primary and a
*06:32.980- 06:39.400* :  secondary school government schools and eyewitnesses say that around 8.30 in the morning as the
*06:39.400- 06:45.560* :  children were sitting for their morning assembly, armed men on motorcycles as stormed onto the
*06:45.560- 06:51.580* :  school grounds and rounded up a number of students. Exact numbers are not known but they estimate
*06:51.580- 06:59.320* :  that about 100 over 100 children have been taken. One child, the girl was shot in the violence and
*06:59.320- 07:05.420* :  she's been hospitalised. And who was responsible and is there a link between what happened today
*07:05.420- 07:09.600* :  in Kaduna state to what happened last week where you are in Borno state?
*07:11.060- 07:17.480* :  So the area where the kidnapping took place, Kurega, is really close to an area that's
*07:17.480- 07:22.540* :  dominated by an affiliator of Boko Haram. It's called Ansaru Boko Haram and they're responsible
*07:22.540- 07:27.860* :  for a lot of the mass abductions that happen in the northwest of Nigeria, so in the states of
*07:27.860- 07:33.220* :  Zamfara, Kaduna, Katzina. So it's believed that those gunmen were from that faction. So there is
*07:33.220- 07:38.220* :  a link with what happened earlier this week with the internally displaced people in the northeast
*07:38.560- 07:43.560* :  in Borno state in that they are also believed to have been abducted by Boko Haram fighters.
*07:44.640- 07:51.560* :  Is Boko Haram then resurgent? I mean, has there been a significant uptick in activity and what
*07:51.560- 07:57.160* :  might be behind that? Well, the authorities here have been keen to say over the past couple of
*07:57.160- 08:03.680* :  years that Boko Haram is all but different. So they say that they've either arrested or converted
*08:03.680- 08:10.940* :  any remaining fighters. But I think what these last two incidents reveal is that the group still
*08:10.940- 08:16.280* :  very much has a presence in northern Nigeria and is still capable of carrying the kind of attacks
*08:16.280- 08:22.280* :  that will remind listeners of the abduction of the Chippell girls 10 years ago in Borno.
*08:23.900- 08:28.520* :  And the anniversary of that abduction is coming up next month. So I think it's particularly
*08:28.520- 08:34.060* :  pointing that after a lot we've had a year, almost two years of not having these numbers,
*08:34.060- 08:39.280* :  you know, over a hundred students being taken. And why do they happen? I mean, is it about
*08:40.080- 08:43.960* :  money for the kidnapping or is their ideology behind it as well?
*08:45.340- 08:50.860* :  By all accounts, the Chippell girls was kind of an accident. Boko Haram were looking for
*08:51.660- 08:54.700* :  you know, some goods that were at their school. They found the girls. They took them and the amount
*08:54.700- 08:59.520* :  of attention that they got kind of spurred them to do more of those types of reductions. I think it's
*08:59.600- 09:06.940* :  evolved to becoming more of a way of making money. A lot of those armed gangs in the north-west
*09:06.940- 09:12.960* :  live in a part of the country that is incredibly impoverished where opportunities for advancement,
*09:12.960- 09:18.900* :  for young people, particularly young men are very few. And therefore, this is an easy way to make
*09:18.900- 09:25.240* :  money desperate parents who often peer at them. You know, regardless of how much they ask. And it's
*09:25.240- 09:29.760* :  also an opportunity for Boko Haram to elevate its profile nationally and internationally to show
*09:29.760- 09:36.440* :  the world that it's still a group to be contended with. Mayany Jones. Satellite images reveal that
*09:36.440- 09:41.500* :  North Korea has built hundreds of kilometers of security fencing along its border with China
*09:41.500- 09:47.040* :  in the past four years. The images have been analysed by the organisation Human Rights Watch
*09:47.040- 09:52.840* :  who say the increased security has had a devastating effect on North Koreans who rely on
*09:52.840- 09:58.640* :  cross-border trade to make a living. June McKenzie reports from Seoul. When North Korea sealed its
*09:58.640- 10:04.060* :  borders at the start of the pandemic, it set to work fortifying them, building fences and increasing
*10:04.060- 10:09.620* :  surveillance, both to stop people escaping and to clamp down on those secretly bringing in food
*10:09.620- 10:14.060* :  and other goods from China. Human Rights Watch has analysed a quarter of North Korea's border
*10:14.060- 10:20.000* :  with China. Along this stretch alone, the number of garposts has jumped from just 38 to more than
*10:20.000- 10:25.640* :  six and a half thousand. One escapee who spoke to her relative back home said rice could no longer
*10:25.640- 10:31.660* :  be smuggled into the country. June McKenzie. It's thought that the world's global shipping fleet
*10:31.660- 10:39.140* :  consists of around 50 to 60,000 cargo vessels. That's a lot of traffic with crews often spending weeks
*10:39.500- 10:46.080* :  at sea, but trials are underway for remotely operated ships, which allow some of the crew to work
*10:46.080- 10:51.920* :  on land and be with their families at the end of their shift. The boats can be navigated from hundreds
*10:51.920- 10:58.280* :  of kilometres away. Our science editor Rebecca Morrell has been to a fjord in Norway to see one of
*10:58.280- 11:06.240* :  these robot ships. The vessel freshly painted in vivid lime green is 78 metres long and it's just
*11:06.240- 11:11.340* :  come off the production line. Here in the back of the ship you can see the real house of the ship
*11:11.740- 11:16.560* :  and above that you can see some of our satellite domes and some more cameras and some microphones
*11:16.560- 11:21.280* :  which represent the eyes and the ears of the ship. Colin Fields works for ocean infinity,
*11:21.280- 11:26.980* :  the company's building a fleet of 23 of these vessels. They're designed to carry out jobs like
*11:26.980- 11:32.140* :  surveys for the offshore renewable sector and oil and gas industries. We've added a lot of
*11:32.140- 11:37.620* :  additional equipment and designed her especially to be what we call robotic. Our ultimate vision is
*11:37.620- 11:46.340* :  for these vessels to have a crew as small crew as possible. The work is shifting from the ship
*11:46.340- 11:51.700* :  to the land to a remote control centre hundreds of miles away in the UK in Southampton.
*11:53.560- 11:57.900* :  In a vast dimly lit room, live images and data stream in from the ship in Norway,
*11:58.460- 12:03.080* :  the land-based crew members sit in large comfy chairs equipped with gaming like controllers.
*12:03.580- 12:09.520* :  You have these joysticks and you also have touch screens. Marianne Metzer-Therida
*12:09.860- 12:15.460* :  is learning to remotely operate parts of the ship. You can do almost everything that you do on
*12:15.660- 12:21.120* :  on the vessel. You can move around, you can steer it, you can have cameras, you can see the cameras
*12:21.120- 12:29.800* :  here. It's exciting to know that there's an opportunity to me to work on shore and still be involved
*12:29.800- 12:37.400* :  in exciting projects. Some vessels are setting sail with absolutely no one on board at all.
*12:37.940- 12:42.740* :  In Plymouth Sound in the southwest of England, a 12 meter long boat is undergoing sea trials.
*12:43.340- 12:49.000* :  An ex-being controlled by a crew located at the other end of the country in an office in Aberdeen
*12:49.000- 12:56.200* :  Scotland. Demetri Dadeachin from the shipping company Fugro is the boats captain.
*13:00.520- 13:06.460* :  Could you show us how you can control it from here? For example, could you move it 90 degrees
*13:06.460- 13:13.820* :  to the left which is port? Port side? Yeah, we're using thrusters and they're setting
*13:13.820- 13:17.920* :  command and you can see on the screen, on the cameras, we're starting to work.
*13:18.040- 13:23.720* :  It's all just by moving your mouse? Yes. Demetri has spent years at sea. Working from an office
*13:23.720- 13:29.020* :  is a big change. When you on the vessel, end of your shift, you will still stay in
*13:29.020- 13:32.960* :  cons of vessel. When you're working here, so end of the day, you just go home.
*13:33.520- 13:38.940* :  Eventually, the captain or master could be in charge of multiple ships in oceans around the world.
*13:38.940- 13:44.900* :  The regulations won't allow this for larger ships yet, but Hiker Degeme from the International
*13:44.900- 13:50.660* :  Maritime Organisation, who sets these rules, says they're being reexamined. Would you now consider
*13:50.660- 13:58.020* :  a remote controlled centre operator being a master, equivalent and how this will all be regulated?
*14:00.280- 14:05.340* :  Back on the dockside in Norway, the next ship is being fitted out. It will be a long time
*14:05.340- 14:10.780* :  before every vessel is robotic, but the next wave of shipping is already on the horizon.
*14:16.240- 14:21.340* :  Still to come, anticipation mounts ahead of a heavyweight boxing bout in Saudi Arabia,
*14:21.840- 14:26.140* :  as an ex-martial art star faces a former World Heavyweight Champion.
*14:31.480- 14:36.180* :  What stories would you like to share with your daughter? What does she need to know to help her
*14:36.180- 14:42.080* :  navigate her life ahead? Dear daughter is the award-winning podcast from the BBC World Service
*14:42.520- 14:47.860* :  full of thoughtful letters of advice, personal stories and life lessons for daughters everywhere,
*14:48.500- 14:53.560* :  and it's back for a new series with more of your letters and more fantastic guests.
*14:54.400- 14:57.860* :  Such for dear daughter, wherever you get your BBC podcast.
*15:03.920- 15:10.340* :  There's something magical about unboxing. When you unbox brickbox, you uncover a world of
*15:10.420- 15:15.300* :  British entertainment, streamed the UK's most brilliant series, including new and upcoming
*15:15.300- 15:20.900* :  seasons of Shetland, Father Brown and Death in Paradise, plus new originals like Payback,
*15:20.900- 15:25.920* :  Irving Welsh's Crime and Archie, the story of Hollywood's greatest leading man,
*15:25.920- 15:30.440* :  Carrie Grant, unboxed brickbox and escape to the best of British TV,

*15:36.760- 15:42.140* :  Officials in Haiti say a state of emergency in the capital port of Prince has been extended
*15:42.140- 15:47.720* :  for another month as a security situation continues to deteriorate in the Caribbean nation.
*15:47.740- 15:53.780* :  Criminal gangs who control much of the capital attacked and burnt down a police station on Wednesday.
*15:53.780- 15:59.880* :  Haiti's Prime Minister, Ariel Henri, has not been able to return from Puerto Rico since Tuesday
*15:59.880- 16:05.720* :  after gang members attacked the country's main airport. A powerful gang leader has called on
*16:05.720- 16:11.640* :  Mr Henri to resign, warning of civil war and further bloodshed. The Prime Minister had been in
*16:11.640- 16:17.280* :  Kenya, appealing for help to send police officers to Haiti. The former US ambassador to Haiti,
*16:17.280- 16:24.500* :  Pamela White, says Kenyan troops will not solve the problem. A how a thousand Kenyans are going
*16:24.500- 16:32.800* :  to this chaotic situation and make any difference from we have 25,000 at least, maybe 30,000
*16:32.800- 16:39.220* :  gang members in control of 80% of Puerto Prince and probably 60% of the country. I know that the
*16:39.220- 16:43.360* :  United States has said over and over, we are not sending troops to Haiti and other UN has said we're
*16:43.360- 16:49.780* :  not sending troops to Haiti and even the Haitian police are running on pretty much zero and many,
*16:49.780- 16:54.720* :  many have left. During the last year, at least a couple thousand have either been killed or gone
*16:54.720- 17:01.880* :  to the United States. I don't see any other solution except to have US and UN troops on the ground.
*17:01.880- 17:05.480* :  I just don't. Dave Fees, AMA is a resident of the capital
*17:05.480- 17:11.040* :  Port of Prince. He runs a charity which uses basketball to keep young Haitians out of trouble.
*17:11.560- 17:15.980* :  Rebecca Kesby asked him what his week had been like. It's definitely been extremely
*17:15.980- 17:21.640* :  challenging since last Thursday. You've had coordinated attacks by Ferris Gangs throughout the
*17:21.800- 17:28.200* :  Puerto Prince metropolitan area. We've had about a dozen or so of our Ben Fish Charries and staff
*17:28.200- 17:34.020* :  members and their family members staying at our office because they've been forced to flee their
*17:34.020- 17:39.780* :  homes. I mean, we're hearing people can't even move around normally, get to work, things like that.
*17:40.460- 17:46.560* :  Exactly, especially since the prison break happened over the weekend. So there's been a
*17:46.560- 17:52.920* :  curfew in place since this past weekend, even though folks are technically allowed to move around
*17:53.460- 17:58.540* :  during daylight hours. I'm currently staring at the street right now in front of my office and
*17:58.540- 18:04.700* :  there are no vehicles in the street whatsoever. It's estimated that there were about 3,696
*18:04.700- 18:10.220* :  prisoners in the main prison. Gang members, some folks who are arrested as far as the assassination
*18:10.220- 18:15.320* :  of the president of Nalmoese. So we have a wide variety of dangerous criminals who were
*18:15.620- 18:20.700* :  incarcerated in that prison who have now escaped. We've got the prime minister currently
*18:20.700- 18:26.840* :  pretty stranded actually in Puerto Rico. We can't fly home and there's been that attack on
*18:26.840- 18:34.380* :  the airport. We've got barbecue now threatening civil war. I wonder what you made of the comments
*18:34.380- 18:41.320* :  there from the former US ambassador saying that UN troops need to go into Haiti and even the
*18:41.320- 18:47.920* :  prospect of Kenyan police turning up. Well, from the very beginning of the UN mentioning a
*18:48.720- 18:53.460* :  multinational security mission coming to the country, I was a bit wary. I never believed that
*18:53.460- 19:00.220* :  having police officers from Kenya and other police officers from countries in the Caribbean
*19:00.220- 19:04.820* :  would be the right approach to dealing with a situation. I think you need a highly specialized
*19:04.820- 19:12.480* :  train soldiers more experienced and real a warfare who would be able to come in and do a more
*19:12.480- 19:18.100* :  of a short-term mission rather than the long-term mission that the UN is proposing. The gangs
*19:18.100- 19:24.480* :  have a great advantage in that they know of the territory much better than these Kenyan police
*19:24.480- 19:28.940* :  officers would be coming in. For ordinary people, the people you work with the children, I mean,
*19:28.940- 19:35.320* :  this all sounds so terrifying and normal life has basically been suspended for what four years now.
*19:36.020- 19:41.140* :  Exactly. It's been a very challenging situation for many years now in Haiti and it's just
*19:41.140- 19:46.640* :  this heartening for me, for example, to be in our office and seeing young people just
*19:46.960- 19:51.880* :  laying cloth on the floor to sleep, staff members sleeping on the hallways. It's just a terrible
*19:51.880- 19:57.520* :  situation to be living through right now. Dave Feese, AMA, in Porta Prince. Final preparations
*19:57.660- 20:03.080* :  are underway in Riyadh and Saudi Arabia for one of this year's most highly anticipated boxing
*20:03.080- 20:08.700* :  matches. Britain's Anthony Joshua will face Cameroon's former mixed martial arts champion,
*20:08.700- 20:14.800* :  Francis and Ganro, in an intriguing heavyweight contest later on Friday. In a moment we'll hear
*20:14.800- 20:21.580* :  from BBC Sports Africa's Immanuel Akindubuwa in Anthony Joshua's hometown in Nigeria. But first
*20:21.580- 20:25.320* :  Paul G. reports from Ganro's birthplace in Cameroon.
*20:33.760- 20:39.040* :  At Francis and Ganro's sports complex in his hometown of Bathe, some of the boxing trainees he
*20:39.040- 20:45.660* :  is inspired are rooting for him in his upcoming fight against Anthony Joshua. Pierre Kudum is one of them.
*20:47.720- 20:52.600* :  We know Anthony Joshua is strong and technical, but our champion is also powerful. He will
*20:52.600- 20:59.800* :  defeat Anthony Joshua. Francis and Ganro's imposing physical strength is closely linked to his
*20:59.800- 21:06.860* :  former work as a minor. Raised by a single mother, he began working in the sand quarry in Bathe
*21:06.860- 21:13.640* :  at just 10 years old. Chasing his dream to become a professional fighter, Ganro left his hometown
*21:13.640- 21:20.660* :  and spent 14 months traveling across Africa, Spain and France. Homeless in Paris, he eventually
*21:20.660- 21:27.160* :  chanced upon an opportunity to train at a boxing gym. Now he is seen as one of his country's finest
*21:27.160- 21:35.600* :  fighting exports. To the people of Bathe and Ganro is like a king. Ganro's uncle,
*21:35.820- 21:42.960* :  Diego Nick Camero, is one of his biggest fans. He's left in the image of not just the Bathe
*21:42.960- 21:48.100* :  community, but also Cameroon and Africa as a whole. He's taken us to the highest levels.
*21:50.560- 21:58.220* :  Back at the gym, the trainees are confident in the astar. The baddest man on the planet is Francis
*21:58.220- 22:07.960* :  and Ganro. He's the only one. He's the champion of champions. I'm here in Chicago in southwestern
*22:07.960- 22:14.380* :  Nigeria where there is a growing sense of anticipation as the town gears up for another fight involving
*22:14.380- 22:22.040* :  Anthony Joshua, a man the region sees as one of its own. The town even has a road named after him.
*22:22.420- 22:26.800* :  It's a burn which A.J. Hood's closed to his heart, haven't spent part of his school in here,
*22:27.140- 22:30.540* :  and has a map of Africa prominently tattooed on his shoulder.
*22:31.120- 22:35.280* :  Jagamas links to Joshua's family go back for more than a century.
*22:35.540- 22:38.800* :  First of all, you're welcome to the Joshua family house in Shadamu.
*22:39.080- 22:45.000* :  Joshua's cousin Raymond Adekaya recalls being the fighter's sparing partner when it visits
*22:45.000- 22:50.900* :  in all the days as a teenager. It runs in the family. We're all tough for my granddad.
*22:51.680- 22:58.120* :  My uncles also, Anthony Joshua's dad, we've grown up to know the tough side of life.
*22:58.120- 23:05.060* :  We've had to struggle. We've come through the hard time. So we have all sort of hard our own
*23:05.100- 23:11.140* :  fascia of either street fights or professional fights. And we've never really come out bottom.
*23:11.500- 23:14.280* :  So I can say he's got the bloodline in boxing.
*23:14.720- 23:20.720* :  Friday's contest between Joshua and Cameroon's friend Susa Garno. It's seen by many
*23:20.720- 23:26.480* :  as a showdown between two African brothers. I'm so optimistic that it's going to win.
*23:26.760- 23:32.000* :  Kaya De Shagun or Kewel is the president of the Anthony Joshua Boxing fans club in Shagamo.
*23:32.240- 23:37.200* :  My expectation for Anthony Joshua's next fight is positive.
*23:37.200- 23:43.500* :  The meeting between Joshua and Garno were denied a long-standing sporting rivalry between Nigeria
*23:43.500- 23:49.780* :  and Cameroon, but for those people in Shagamo, the message is clear. It can only be one we now.
*23:50.060- 23:55.820* :  Emmanuel Akin Dubuwa reporting. China says it will continue trying to make Muslim
*23:55.820- 24:02.000* :  Uyghurs in Xinjiang more Chinese. It has similar aims for other ethnic minorities across the country
*24:02.000- 24:06.720* :  as Mickey Bristol reports. China has been accused of carrying out widespread human
*24:06.720- 24:13.020* :  rights abuses in Xinjiang. It denies the accusations and says it's simply introduced policies to fight
*24:13.020- 24:18.660* :  extremism. Speaking of China's annual parliamentary session, Xinjiang's Communist Party chief
*24:18.660- 24:24.380* :  said these policies would continue, and ethnic Uyghurs would be pushed to speak more Mandarin Chinese.
*24:25.160- 24:29.780* :  Beijing employs similar policies for Tibetans, Mongolians, and other ethnic minorities.
*24:30.400- 24:34.300* :  China's aim is to create a single Chinese national identity.
*24:34.300- 24:39.540* :  Mickey Bristol. The woman who accused the principal of the Red Bull formula one racing team
*24:39.540- 24:45.320* :  Christian Horner of inappropriate and controlling behaviour has been suspended on full pay.
*24:45.420- 24:51.560* :  Mr Horner, who denied the allegations, was allowed to remain in his role after the claims were rejected.
*24:52.220- 24:57.720* :  Red Bull racing has declined to comment. Our sports news correspondent Laura Scott is following
*24:57.720- 25:03.360* :  developments. Well, it was a few weeks ago as the build up to the season was underway that we
*25:03.360- 25:09.400* :  first heard that Christian Horner was under investigation by Red Bull, the parent company
*25:09.400- 25:15.500* :  of his team Red Bull racing. Now, we knew at that time that these allegations were ones that Red Bull
*25:15.500- 25:20.740* :  were taking very seriously. We understood that it was inappropriate and controlling behaviour
*25:20.740- 25:27.720* :  that was being alleged. He denied the accusations every time we spoke to him. And then last week,
*25:27.720- 25:33.420* :  he was cleared of wrongdoing by Red Bull. They said that the complainant did have the right to
*25:33.420- 25:39.060* :  appeal, but that the investigation had been robust and thorough. The following day, just as
*25:39.060- 25:44.660* :  everyone was getting ready for the Bahrain Grand Prix, there was a leak of a raft of messages
*25:44.660- 25:50.920* :  purporting to involve Christian Horner. Now, he again denied the accusations, but it intensified
*25:50.920- 25:57.320* :  the scrutiny surrounding him. He is acting very much as business as usual. Red Bull racing went
*25:57.320- 26:03.640* :  on to win the Bahrain Grand Prix. And then today, as we prepare for the Saudi Arabia Grand Prix,
*26:03.640- 26:09.840* :  it emerged that the complainant had been suspended by Red Bull racing. Now, they haven't commented,
*26:09.840- 26:14.300* :  saying it's an internal matter. But of course, this means the story is far from going away.
*26:14.780- 26:19.940* :  And Christian Horner, he was asked about this, wasn't he? He was. There was a media conference
*26:19.940- 26:25.340* :  involving a number of team principals. And all of the questions from the media were two Christian
*26:25.340- 26:30.680* :  Horner, and all of them were around this issue, not for me to one itself, which clearly frustrates him.
*26:31.140- 26:37.560* :  Now, he was asked if he had regrets about potential reputational damage of the saga. And he said,
*26:37.560- 26:41.480* :  one has to go back to the basis of a grievance was raised, it was fully investigated,
*26:41.920- 26:46.300* :  and it was dismissed. From there, we move onwards. I think an awful lot has been made of this.
*26:46.600- 26:51.940* :  And I think the time now is to look forward and to draw a line under it. We are here to go racing.
*26:51.980- 26:58.040* :  So he's very clear that we should all just move on. But it must be a distraction. I mean,
*26:58.040- 27:03.080* :  but Red Bull are doing quite well. They are. I mean, if you look at the results last weekend in
*27:03.080- 27:10.160* :  Bahrain, they were one, two on the podium, which would suggest that they can, as the drivers go,
*27:10.160- 27:15.080* :  they can block this out. But Christian Horner did acknowledge in the build-up to the season that
*27:15.080- 27:19.580* :  this has been a distraction. And we will see how this plays out. We know that there is a bit of
*27:19.580- 27:25.720* :  division within the team with Max Verstappen's father Yoss saying that this whole issue off the track
*27:25.720- 27:31.740* :  is driving people apart. And we had Max Verstappen asked about this. He said, my father is not a liar.
*27:32.260- 27:35.840* :  So Christian Horner wants everyone to focus on the racing. He says the team is unified.
*27:35.900- 27:43.400* :  But this controversy very much continues. Laura Scott, the film Oppenheimer about the creator of
*27:43.400- 27:49.480* :  the atomic bomb is up for 13 awards at this weekend's Oscars. Directed by Christopher Nolan,
*27:49.480- 27:54.720* :  it tells the story of the Manhattan Project during the Second World War when scientists built
*27:54.720- 28:00.500* :  the bombs that were used on Japan. Los Alamos, the town in New Mexico where Oppenheimer carried out
*28:00.500- 28:06.500* :  his work, continues to play a key role in American nuclear weapons production. But as M.
*28:06.500- 28:10.320* :  Avardy reports from the town, it's dealing with a conflicted history.
*28:10.960- 28:15.280* :  It's Saturday morning and I've come to the Martin town where everyone walks their dogs.
*28:17.400- 28:21.740* :  A handful of scientists gathered for their Saturday ritual. Give the dogs a run about,
*28:21.740- 28:25.780* :  then it's over to the local brewery. It is 12 a 1 let's have a beer.
*28:27.460- 28:31.340* :  Many are drinking the local brew, known naturally as Oppenheimer.
*28:31.920- 28:35.820* :  Gerald, a local bartender, says the film was brought plenty of new business.
*28:36.100- 28:40.880* :  We've been seeing a lot of tourism increase, a lot of extra attention. We're selling a lot more
*28:40.880- 28:46.700* :  merchandise. What about the moral aspect of what this symbolizes? Well, we definitely have a very
*28:46.860- 28:51.600* :  sort of nuanced and balanced view of that. There are a lot of people who are only here because of
*28:51.600- 28:55.840* :  the nuclear side of things. They're completely dependent on that. That's why they're here.
*28:56.580- 29:01.260* :  But we do have to have that recognition of when things go wrong or even when things are used
*29:01.640- 29:06.880* :  as a weapon, like how horrific things can be. Oppenheimer and there you go. Choose that.
*29:06.880- 29:11.200* :  People who live here are cutely aware of the ethical dilemmas that come with the science.
*29:11.900- 29:17.140* :  Here's Sobia. Being a resident here and, you know, seeing what the science does,
*29:17.640- 29:22.520* :  for the community and what it does for the country. That's pretty amazing and I thought that it was
*29:22.520- 29:28.280* :  a chance for all of us to tell that story from that angle. There was loss of life and that's tragic.
*29:28.280- 29:33.700* :  Kristen Hollis from the Historical Society shows visitors around, but there's a delicate balance
*29:33.700- 29:40.540* :  to strike. Los Alamos attracts both interested tourists and anti-war protesters. It's really easy
*29:40.540- 29:47.880* :  for us 75 years later to sit in self-righteous judgment of decisions that were made in very
*29:47.880- 29:53.760* :  different circumstances in the world than we are living today. Are we saying there's a chance that
*29:53.760- 30:00.380* :  when we push that button, we destroy the world. The atomic bomb killed more than 200,000
*30:00.380- 30:06.560* :  people in Japan. But according to some communities in New Mexico, there were also victims closer to
*30:06.560- 30:12.300* :  home. Both my great-grandfathers had cancer. My two grandmothers had cancer. My father had
*30:12.300- 30:16.960* :  three different cancers he didn't have risk factors for. Tina campaigns for government compensation
*30:16.960- 30:22.440* :  for families known as the Downwinders, who claimed they were affected by the detonation carried
*30:22.440- 30:27.800* :  out in 1945. The world's first nuclear explosion known as the Trinity Test.
*30:28.200- 30:34.120* :  So the people of New Mexico ever since the time of the test have been suffering a variety of
*30:34.120- 30:40.700* :  different cancers. We firmly believe that we have been overexposed to radiation during the Trinity
*30:45.380- 30:51.040* :  bomb. Anti-war campaigners want to see an end to nuclear production at Los Alamos
*30:51.040- 30:57.300* :  as the Oscars approach. Many see Oppenheimer not only as a historical tale, but as a warning that
*30:57.300- 31:04.860* :  remains just as relevant today. Emma Vardy reporting from Los Alamos in New Mexico.
