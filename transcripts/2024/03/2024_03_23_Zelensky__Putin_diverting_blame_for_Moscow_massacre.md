*02:10.280- 02:11.640* :  the 24th of March.
*02:11.640- 02:12.940* :  These are our main stories.
*02:13.600- 02:16.760* :  As Russia seeks to blame Ukraine for Friday's concert hall
*02:16.760- 02:18.100* :  massacre near Moscow,
*02:18.600- 02:21.080* :  President Zelensky responds angrily.
*02:21.740- 02:24.900* :  Reports from Gaza say 19 people have been killed
*02:24.900- 02:26.260* :  while queuing for aid.
*02:26.780- 02:29.020* :  Israel denies its forces, shot at them.
*02:29.780- 02:33.300* :  And relief for the families of 16 school children in Nigeria
*02:33.300- 02:36.480* :  who were freed a fortnight after their abduction.
*02:39.100- 02:39.920* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:39.920- 02:43.500* :  it is the staple food from the poor to the rich.
*02:44.100- 02:45.380* :  Everyone uses onion.
*02:45.940- 02:50.380* :  Why onions are proving to be an important issue in India's elections.
*02:54.860- 02:58.760* :  Ukraine's president has reacted angrily to Vladimir Putin's claims
*02:58.760- 03:02.500* :  that Kiev was involved in a deadly shooting and bomb attack
*03:02.880- 03:05.200* :  at a concert hall near Moscow on Friday.
*03:06.060- 03:07.560* :  As we record this podcast,
*03:07.560- 03:11.400* :  the number of dead stands at 133.
*03:12.260- 03:14.900* :  Russia says it's arrested all four gummin'
*03:14.900- 03:18.420* :  who stormed the Crocus City Hall along with seven other people.
*03:19.240- 03:20.160* :  In a televised address,
*03:20.160- 03:23.520* :  Russia's president claimed the gummin' had helped from Ukraine
*03:23.520- 03:25.640* :  and were heading there when captured,
*03:26.280- 03:29.880* :  despite the Islamic State groups saying it carried out the shooting.
*03:30.580- 03:33.680* :  In the past few hours, Vladimir Zelensky has responded,
*03:33.680- 03:38.220* :  saying Moscow is predictably seeking to divert blame.
*03:38.660- 03:40.980* :  This is Talisa, daughter of Moscow.
*03:41.420- 03:43.900* :  What happened on Friday in Moscow,
*03:44.660- 03:46.880* :  it's obvious that both Russian President
*03:46.880- 03:51.820* :  Vladimir Putin and his gang are trying to shift responsibility
*03:52.780- 03:53.820* :  onto someone else.
*03:54.580- 03:56.660* :  They always use the same method.
*03:57.360- 03:58.360* :  It's already happened.
*03:58.800- 04:01.260* :  Instead of dealing with his Russian citizens
*04:01.980- 04:03.640* :  and addressing their concerns,
*04:04.400- 04:06.440* :  Putin was silent for the whole day,
*04:06.440- 04:10.760* :  thinking about how to link the events to Ukraine.
*04:11.000- 04:14.300* :  Everything he does is completely predictable.
*04:16.200- 04:17.520* :  Our Eastern Europe correspondent,
*04:17.520- 04:19.220* :  Sarah Reinsford, is in Kiev.
*04:19.500- 04:22.260* :  I asked her to analyze President Putin's assertion
*04:22.260- 04:23.720* :  that Ukraine was involved.
*04:24.380- 04:27.640* :  Well, he certainly seems to be suggesting very openly
*04:27.640- 04:29.640* :  that Ukraine was involved,
*04:29.640- 04:32.040* :  if not entirely responsible, yes.
*04:32.040- 04:37.080* :  I mean, he has hinted at this being an international terrorism attack.
*04:37.200- 04:40.160* :  He's talked about a common threat that many countries face,
*04:40.760- 04:41.600* :  but at the same time,
*04:41.600- 04:45.380* :  he has talked about the shooting by these men,
*04:45.940- 04:48.360* :  comparing them to Nazis on occupied territory,
*04:48.360- 04:50.100* :  carrying out punishment attacks,
*04:50.140- 04:52.920* :  which is the kind of language he always uses
*04:53.160- 04:54.640* :  when talking about Ukraine,
*04:54.640- 04:57.620* :  always talking about a neo-Nazi regime in Kiev,
*04:57.620- 05:01.360* :  that's Vladimir Putin's language is narrative about this country.
*05:01.360- 05:05.080* :  So there is a clear attempt to try to link this in some way to Ukraine.
*05:05.120- 05:07.680* :  And of course, he has then come right out and said
*05:07.680- 05:10.860* :  that Ukraine was opening a window on the border
*05:11.380- 05:15.460* :  to let the terrorists through as they escaped from the scene in Moscow.
*05:15.660- 05:19.100* :  Now, Ukraine has been absolutely clear that it had nothing to do with the attack
*05:19.100- 05:22.340* :  and that it certainly says this idea of some kind of window on the border
*05:22.340- 05:24.020* :  just doesn't stand up to scrutiny.
*05:24.020- 05:27.920* :  We've heard it described to me by the intelligence directorate here.
*05:27.920- 05:31.620* :  They've said it's absurd because of one basic thing.
*05:31.720- 05:33.640* :  That entire border area is a frontline.
*05:33.640- 05:35.160* :  There is active fighting there.
*05:35.680- 05:38.240* :  And there's a lot of Russian soldiers and security agents.
*05:38.280- 05:41.900* :  And the idea that some terrorists fleeing a giant attack in Moscow
*05:41.900- 05:45.280* :  would try to escape by running towards the FSB
*05:45.280- 05:48.840* :  and to Russia military just sounds completely impossible,
*05:48.840- 05:50.140* :  crazy, unimaginable.
*05:50.140- 05:51.700* :  But that is what Vladimir Putin is claiming
*05:51.700- 05:53.700* :  and that's why people in Ukraine are worried
*05:54.040- 05:55.400* :  that they're going to have this pinned on them
*05:55.440- 05:57.840* :  and that will mean even further escalation
*05:58.200- 06:00.160* :  of Russia's war on this country.
*06:00.580- 06:03.360* :  And also questions for him and the Russian intelligence services
*06:03.840- 06:05.500* :  about the fact that a couple of weeks ago
*06:05.900- 06:08.460* :  there were warnings from the West, from the US
*06:08.460- 06:11.140* :  that extremists could be planning attacks in Russia
*06:11.140- 06:13.080* :  on large gatherings, including concerts.
*06:14.000- 06:16.940* :  Yes, and Vladimir Putin openly rejected that.
*06:16.960- 06:17.760* :  He dismissed it.
*06:17.780- 06:21.120* :  He called it blackmail, which is an unusual choice of word.
*06:21.120- 06:22.080* :  I don't quite know what he meant,
*06:22.120- 06:24.160* :  but he certainly wasn't giving it any credence
*06:24.180- 06:27.460* :  and it certainly wasn't a warning that was passed on to Russian citizens.
*06:27.740- 06:30.740* :  So American citizens were told by their embassy in Moscow.
*06:31.120- 06:33.240* :  The British Foreign Office also published a warning
*06:33.240- 06:36.920* :  saying there was the threat of imminent extremist attacks
*06:36.920- 06:39.820* :  and specifically mentioned concerts as one of the possible targets.
*06:40.120- 06:41.640* :  So Vladimir Putin dismissed that.
*06:41.640- 06:43.580* :  The foreign ministry also dismissed it.
*06:43.920- 06:44.900* :  So yeah, big question.
*06:45.080- 06:48.060* :  Did that information get passed on to Vladimir Putin
*06:48.060- 06:49.560* :  and he ignored it?
*06:49.860- 06:51.040* :  If so, why?
*06:51.040- 06:53.220* :  I think there's a lot of questions to answer.
*06:53.360- 06:55.020* :  But in Russia today, those questions
*06:55.020- 06:56.780* :  won't even be asked, let alone answered.
*06:57.640- 06:59.160* :  Sarah Reinsford in Kiev.
*06:59.940- 07:01.980* :  And more witness accounts have been emerging
*07:01.980- 07:04.060* :  from Friday's terrifying attack.
*07:04.660- 07:07.080* :  Dave Primov is a photographer who was at the concert.
*07:07.700- 07:10.540* :  He was in an upstairs balcony when the shooting started.
*07:11.000- 07:13.360* :  He described his experience to James Kumersami.
*07:14.300- 07:17.200* :  We come to the concert.
*07:17.260- 07:23.060* :  We sit at our place waiting five or seven minutes
*07:23.420- 07:24.760* :  before the start of the concert.
*07:25.180- 07:27.160* :  We heard the shots.
*07:27.720- 07:32.440* :  First, I think maybe this is some part of the show.
*07:32.880- 07:36.220* :  And I am asked my colleague who'd been with me.
*07:36.560- 07:37.420* :  Did you listen to it?
*07:38.680- 07:40.880* :  He said, maybe it's fireworks.
*07:41.800- 07:44.000* :  But we stay on the balcony.
*07:44.000- 07:48.820* :  Then we saw how the people at downside
*07:49.000- 07:53.520* :  going like a river from one side to another side.
*07:53.840- 07:57.080* :  And after I heard the really shooting,
*07:57.080- 07:59.580* :  it's the real shooting from the gun.
*08:00.360- 08:03.380* :  The panic starts at upstairs also.
*08:04.200- 08:06.380* :  Did you see the people who were doing the shooting?
*08:06.920- 08:10.140* :  I saw the people maybe after two or three minutes.
*08:10.960- 08:11.920* :  More, more shooting.
*08:11.920- 08:15.200* :  And all people lie on this earth.
*08:15.520- 08:18.280* :  And in this time, I look to downside.
*08:19.000- 08:22.780* :  And I saw the flesh of shooting.
*08:22.860- 08:25.360* :  And I saw people with a gun.
*08:25.780- 08:27.500* :  First, I see one people.
*08:27.580- 08:32.880* :  And then I saw one more shooting directly to the people.
*08:33.300- 08:35.760* :  Not to the roof, not to the walls.
*08:36.140- 08:37.560* :  And what were you doing at the time?
*08:37.560- 08:40.380* :  Were you lying down or you were on the balcony?
*08:40.380- 08:41.480* :  Yes, we were lying down.
*08:41.480- 08:46.540* :  But a lot of people and we cannot lie all together.
*08:47.320- 08:50.640* :  In this moment, I'm thinking about now I can die.
*08:50.900- 08:53.280* :  After some time, next step.
*08:53.400- 08:56.620* :  To going down from main stairs to the main hall,
*08:56.720- 08:58.600* :  it's absolutely not safe because
*08:59.200- 09:01.300* :  I'm the shooting starting from main hall.
*09:01.620- 09:05.100* :  And we can go down by main stairs.
*09:05.100- 09:10.540* :  But we need go down because I saw the fire starting inside.
*09:11.120- 09:14.840* :  So you had to decide which was the greater risk.
*09:14.840- 09:18.640* :  Was it more risky to stay and wait for the shooting to stop
*09:18.640- 09:21.420* :  and maybe get caught up in the fire?
*09:21.420- 09:25.100* :  Or was it safer to leave, get away from the fire
*09:25.100- 09:26.960* :  and maybe risk getting shot?
*09:27.580- 09:33.180* :  First, we try, of course, to open all doors which we can find.
*09:33.180- 09:36.000* :  But all the doors closed.
*09:37.000- 09:41.960* :  Then, after some moments, we try to block one door
*09:42.340- 09:46.340* :  with about seven or eight big men.
*09:46.340- 09:51.460* :  Like me, after that, we find the stairs,
*09:51.980- 09:54.320* :  technical stairs to down floor.
*09:54.320- 10:00.020* :  And like this, we find way out to the street to the outside.
*10:00.740- 10:03.440* :  Photographer Dave Primoff, who was in the concert hall
*10:03.580- 10:04.600* :  when the attack happened.
*10:05.500- 10:08.800* :  The latest reports out of Gaza say at least 19 people
*10:08.800- 10:12.060* :  who were queuing for aid have been killed by Israeli forces.
*10:12.560- 10:15.500* :  The Hamas run health ministry said they were hit by tank fire
*10:15.540- 10:17.700* :  and shelling at a roadside distribution point
*10:17.700- 10:19.440* :  on the outskirts of Gaza City.
*10:20.020- 10:22.640* :  The Israeli army has denied firing on the crowd.
*10:23.200- 10:24.900* :  With more details, here's Mike Thompson.
*10:25.780- 10:28.360* :  This is the latest in a string of recent incidents
*10:28.360- 10:31.620* :  where people in Gaza have been killed while awaiting aid.
*10:32.080- 10:35.680* :  As in previous cases, Israeli forces have denied responsibility
*10:35.680- 10:39.580* :  for the deaths at a roadside distribution point in Gaza City.
*10:40.180- 10:43.940* :  Fighting has continued to rage around the city's Al-Shifa hospital
*10:44.380- 10:47.100* :  where the army says it's killed a further 20 gunmen.
*10:47.500- 10:50.060* :  Hamas insists those who died weren't fighters
*10:50.060- 10:53.220* :  but injured patients, medical staff or displaced people.
*10:53.800- 10:56.320* :  And Israeli commander has said the raid on the hospital
*10:56.320- 11:01.300* :  won't finish until the last militant is in the army's hands alive or dead.
*11:02.260- 11:04.600* :  Well, this came shortly after the UN Secretary-General
*11:04.600- 11:07.400* :  Antonio Guterres visited the main crossing point
*11:07.400- 11:12.440* :  into Gaza in Egypt, where he once again made an emotional appeal
*11:12.660- 11:14.260* :  for an immediate ceasefire.
*11:14.840- 11:17.980* :  Our correspondent Hugo Buscega traveled with the Secretary-General.
*11:18.960- 11:21.000* :  On the Egyptian side of the Rafa crossing,
*11:21.000- 11:24.980* :  convoy's carrying basic supplies are waiting to enter Gaza,
*11:25.480- 11:27.000* :  where the desperation only grows.
*11:27.860- 11:31.580* :  The UN says more than 1,500 lawyers remain in Egypt.
*11:32.220- 11:33.640* :  Some have been here for weeks.
*11:34.540- 11:37.920* :  Western countries and charities have blamed Israel for inspections
*11:37.920- 11:40.200* :  that are slow and arbitrary.
*11:41.060- 11:43.520* :  They say entire deliveries have been turned away
*11:43.520- 11:47.820* :  because they included items like medical scissors or sleeping bags
*11:48.200- 11:50.180* :  that have been banned by the Israeli authorities.
*11:50.960- 11:54.660* :  Visiting the border, the UN Chief Antonio Guterres said
*11:54.660- 11:58.480* :  Palestinians in Gaza were stuck in a non-stop nightmare.
*11:58.900- 12:05.280* :  Here from this crossing, we see the heartbreak and heartlessness have evolved.
*12:06.780- 12:11.440* :  A long line of blocked red relief trucks on one side of the gates.
*12:12.620- 12:15.640* :  The long shadow of starvation on the other.
*12:16.900- 12:20.140* :  That is more than tragic. It is a moral outrage.
*12:21.140- 12:24.140* :  His visit happened just days after a UN-backed report
*12:24.140- 12:28.240* :  said half of Gaza's population of 2.2 million people
*12:28.640- 12:30.800* :  faced catastrophic levels of hunger.
*12:31.500- 12:37.320* :  Speaking to the BBC, Mr. Guterres urged Israel to leave the obstacles to the delivery of aid.
*12:37.940- 12:41.280* :  Do you think these obstacles are intentional?
*12:42.020- 12:50.600* :  It is obvious that these obstacles are part of the way the war is being conducted
*12:51.160- 12:52.680* :  in relation to Gaza.
*12:52.980- 12:59.460* :  The Israeli government rejects the criticism and says the UN has failed to distribute aid inside Gaza.
*13:01.220- 13:04.360* :  On the Egyptian side of the Raffa border crossing into Gaza.
*13:05.400- 13:08.900* :  Now some good news out of Nigeria where the authorities say 16
*13:08.900- 13:12.360* :  children and a woman who were kidnapped from a school in the north west of the country
*13:12.360- 13:14.500* :  of Fortnight ago have been rescued.
*13:15.260- 13:20.020* :  They were taken two days after nearly 300 students and staff were abducted from a school
*13:20.020- 13:25.880* :  in Kaduna State. Mass kidnappings have been a constant problem across Northern Nigeria
*13:26.420- 13:29.640* :  since the abduction of schoolgirls from Chibok a decade ago
*13:30.060- 13:32.840* :  which sparked an international campaign for their return.
*13:33.660- 13:36.000* :  With more details about these latest kidnappings,
*13:36.040- 13:38.760* :  here's our Africa regional editor, Will Ross.
*13:39.480- 13:43.980* :  The governor of Sokato State, Ahmed Aliu, said the freed hostages were all in good health.
*13:43.980- 13:46.600* :  He said the students have been reunited with their families.
*13:46.960- 13:48.020* :  I'm really overwhelmed.
*13:49.680- 13:55.800* :  Being that all the abducted children were as cute and hard.
*14:00.760- 14:03.340* :  We're told the army was involved in the rescue operation.
*14:03.340- 14:06.100* :  What we don't know is whether any ransom was handed over.
*14:06.560- 14:11.220* :  A senior military commander has promised that people in Sokato State will now be free from the
*14:11.220- 14:15.500* :  kidnapping gangs. But in recent years it's become clear that this is a lucrative business
*14:15.500- 14:21.500* :  and will be hard to stop. The raid on Sangaya school happened just two days after almost 300
*14:21.520- 14:25.940* :  students and staff were seized in Kaduna State. They're all still missing.
*14:27.160- 14:31.780* :  Will Ross. Hong Kong's new national security law came into force on Saturday,
*14:31.780- 14:38.000* :  putting into immediate effect tough penalties of up-to-life imprisonment for crimes including
*14:38.000- 14:43.460* :  treason and insurrection. The territories pro-Beijing Chief Executive, John Lee,
*14:43.460- 14:49.320* :  had called for the law commonly referred to as article 23 to be rushed through.
*14:49.320- 14:55.360* :  And it was, with little debate. Mr Lee and the authorities in mainland China say it's a
*14:55.360- 15:01.200* :  necessary safeguard against troublemakers. But it's been strongly criticized by Western countries
*15:01.200- 15:07.240* :  and Japan for further damaging the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers. Carmen Lau is a former
*15:07.240- 15:12.620* :  elected district counsellor in Hong Kong. She's now a human rights activist based in the UK.
*15:13.520- 15:22.100* :  The causes are arbitrary. It's really fake and broad that even layman citizen will have a chance
*15:22.100- 15:30.160* :  to break the law. For example, there are a few causes regarding state seekers and also treasons.
*15:30.160- 15:38.560* :  All of the interaction with, they say, foreign forces are being regarded as breaking the law.
*15:39.060- 15:45.100* :  Simply, for example, just maybe communicating with the outside world would have been a chance
*15:45.100- 15:52.240* :  to break the law if someone's reported to the authorities. Communications with foreign media
*15:52.700- 16:00.000* :  may also be regarded as having connections with foreign forces. This article 23 creates a
*16:00.800- 16:06.840* :  even worse chilling effect to Hong Kongers. Because since 2020, Hong Kongers
*16:07.540- 16:14.440* :  inside Hong Kong are either being silent or already being jailed. The law has just been passed
*16:14.440- 16:20.560* :  for a few days. But I've already seen some of my friends, they've deactivated their accounts on
*16:20.560- 16:27.700* :  social media even there in fake names. Human rights activists, Carmen Lau. The renowned Italian
*16:27.700- 16:34.100* :  pianist, Maurizio Polini, has died at the age of 82. Born in Milan, he had an international
*16:34.100- 16:39.300* :  career that spent more than six decades. Judy Frankel looks back at his life.
*16:40.160- 16:45.380* :  Maurizio Polini began playing the piano at five and gave his first recital in Milan at 11.
*16:46.180- 16:51.740* :  In 1960, when he was just 18 years old, he entered the Warsaw Shopper International Competition
*16:52.280- 16:53.260* :  and wowed the judges.
*17:02.060- 17:06.300* :  In an interview with the BBC in 2017, he explained his love of shopping.
*17:06.600- 17:14.420* :  I think to be consider the shopping player is a compliment. I take it absolutely as a compliment.
*17:14.420- 17:20.740* :  His composition sounds of the piano, perhaps the more beautiful way that any other composer is
*17:20.740- 17:26.220* :  possible. This is a touch of magic, certainly my Chopin.
*17:29.120- 17:33.640* :  But his repertoire was wide. As well as Chopin composes such as Beethoven and Schumann,
*17:33.900- 17:39.580* :  he also played 20th century and more contemporary music, including Stravinsky and Stockhausen.
*17:48.080- 17:52.820* :  Known for his intellectual rigor, he was among those rare artists to whom other musicians
*17:52.820- 17:58.160* :  paid close attention. And he was a master of the keyboard, able to play the most difficult
*17:58.160- 18:04.020* :  music with barely a wrong note. But some critics found his interpretations came more from the head
*18:04.020- 18:09.620* :  than the heart. He was interested in chess and politics. He was a member of the Italian Communist
*18:09.620- 18:15.420* :  Party for a while and a vocal critic of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. But as he told the BBC,
*18:15.420- 18:18.880* :  it was music above all that got him up every morning.
*18:19.400- 18:26.180* :  I couldn't live without the music. So every day, I think, is a enormous luck that I can
*18:26.180- 18:33.920* :  sit on the piano and practice, because I have a relation with wonderful piece of music.
*18:34.060- 18:40.480* :  This is an incredible luck that we have. This is something absolutely special.
*18:41.080- 18:46.900* :  His death was announced by La Scala Opera House in Milan, where he performed nearly 170 times,
*18:47.580- 18:49.680* :  and where he would lie in state until his funeral.
*18:56.000- 19:00.480* :  Judy Frankall, on the life of the Italian pianist, Maurizio Polini.

*19:06.120- 19:10.740* :  Every single line in that song has some sort of grammatical or language error.
*19:11.500- 19:18.120* :  We meet the man who was so annoyed by grammatical mistakes he decided to make a musical full of them.
*19:24.120- 19:28.180* :  Where to be a woman is the podcast celebrating the best of women's well-being.

*19:56.220- 19:59.520* :  How would you like to look five years younger? In a clinical study,
*19:59.520- 20:05.200* :  people that had volume added with Juvederm Voluma XC in the cheeks perceived themselves as

*21:04.420- 21:09.700* :  It's not often that a humble vegetable becomes an issue in national elections, but that's what's
*21:09.700- 21:16.460* :  happening in India with onions. India is the world's largest exporter of onions. The authorities in
*21:16.460- 21:21.620* :  Delhi have just announced an indefinite extension of a ban on those exports, a move that's likely
*21:21.620- 21:28.380* :  to increase prices in some overseas markets. So, have onions become a political hot potato in
*21:28.380- 21:32.180* :  India? Our South Asia correspondent and brassen at Eurasian told us more.
*21:32.940- 21:37.920* :  Well, what traders would see this as a political move? Because economically speaking,
*21:37.920- 21:44.540* :  the prices have come down by 50% since last November, when the government was discussing about
*21:44.540- 21:50.460* :  imposing a ban on exports. And it will be a huge loss, even for onion growers, because many
*21:50.460- 21:55.240* :  people started growing onions, especially in the state of Maharashtra, hoping that the government
*21:55.240- 22:01.660* :  will lift the ban. Now, you mentioned humble, but this humble onion can also change governments,
*22:01.660- 22:07.720* :  particularly in India, because the prices went up to nearly $1.5 last year, triggering concerns.
*22:08.180- 22:12.760* :  So, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government doesn't want to take any chance, because the
*22:12.760- 22:18.700* :  elections are only a few weeks away, in case of any increase in prices of onion, because it is
*22:18.700- 22:25.680* :  the staple food from the poor to the rich. Everyone uses onion, whether it is biryani, or even
*22:25.680- 22:30.640* :  some parts of India where people will eat flat bread with just onion, because they can't
*22:30.640- 22:36.200* :  afford to buy other vegetables. So, onion is a very key player, especially in the runner for
*22:36.200- 22:41.840* :  the elections. For Indians, onions are like pasta for Italians, or cheese for the French.
*22:43.020- 22:48.140* :  Yes, indeed. And if you talk about any dish, whether they're in India or in Bangladesh or in
*22:48.140- 22:53.420* :  Pakistan, you cannot start your cooking without putting some onions on the table first.
*22:54.000- 22:59.320* :  And as I mentioned, like some people just eat raw onion with chapati or the Indian made bread.
*22:59.320- 23:04.820* :  The impact it is having is on other countries, because many people, like in Nepal, for example,
*23:04.820- 23:10.860* :  they fully depend on Indian onion imports, and all of a sudden, if India stops, that is having
*23:10.860- 23:16.500* :  a huge impact on the local market and local produce, in Bangladesh, in Malaysia, in the UAE.
*23:16.900- 23:22.300* :  So, they all want India to follow a certain type of consistent policy. They don't want India to
*23:22.300- 23:27.500* :  keep changing the mind, so that they can have a consistent supply of onions, so that they will not
*23:27.500- 23:31.480* :  have any impact, they will not have any problem among their own public.
*23:32.480- 23:37.800* :  I'm Brassan Etirajan. In Australia, new rules have come into force that aim to reduce the intake
*23:37.800- 23:42.720* :  of foreign students. They're part of a plan to bring down the number of migrant arrivals,
*23:42.720- 23:49.420* :  a topic that's become an important political issue as many Australians complain of a housing crisis.
*23:50.060- 23:55.000* :  Mickey Bristo reports. Foreign students arriving in Australia will have to pass a tougher
*23:55.000- 24:00.480* :  English test, and also be more checks to ensure student visas aren't being used by people who
*24:00.740- 24:06.240* :  simply want to work. The rules were relaxed at the end of the pandemic to allowing more migrants
*24:06.240- 24:12.300* :  to fill vacant jobs as the economy rebounded. But immigration in Australia is now at a record
*24:12.300- 24:18.500* :  high and that intake of more than half a million people last year. This is put in pressure on
*24:18.500- 24:26.300* :  the housing market and has led to calls for restrictions. Mickey Bristo. Bad grammar is a thing
*24:26.300- 24:32.640* :  up with which many people will not put. A sentence which proves getting it right grammatically
*24:32.640- 24:39.280* :  doesn't necessarily make for easy understanding or speaking. That said, people do get quite hot
*24:39.280- 24:44.880* :  under the collar about grammatical mistakes. But even the most pedantic member of the grammar
*24:44.880- 24:51.300* :  police probably hasn't been so annoyed by poor use of language that they felt the urge to create
*24:51.340- 24:57.840* :  a musical on the subject. That's where Jeffrey Berg comes in. Here's a chaser from his musical.
*25:00.560- 25:08.680* :  It's the comma for the end in red, white and blue. It forces you to pause where you wouldn't have to.
*25:09.420- 25:16.380* :  The angry Gromarian has just ended a sold out run in Philadelphia. Jeffrey Berg spoke to Julian
*25:16.380- 25:24.340* :  Warwicka. Back in the 2000s, mid 2000s, I started writing a column about grammar for a paper
*25:24.340- 25:28.960* :  in Philadelphia where I live and it was inspired by honestly reading Lin Trusses,
*25:29.080- 25:33.720* :  each shoot some leaves. I had read that this book had come out. It was before it was even out in
*25:33.720- 25:41.160* :  the States. I said, this is a book that I absolutely need to read. I went on Amazon UK and got a
*25:41.360- 25:47.260* :  copy shipped to the States. A few years later, I decided that I would love to write a column
*25:47.260- 25:52.060* :  about grammar. I started doing that and it developed a following. In the meantime, I was always
*25:52.060- 25:57.920* :  a fan of musical theater and started just writing some grammatical parodies on my own. They
*25:57.920- 26:03.060* :  weren't very good, but I enjoyed them. They had a good time with them. I was talking with a friend
*26:03.060- 26:06.500* :  one day and he said, hey, do you think the angry Gromarian, which was also the name of the column,
*26:06.500- 26:10.580* :  said, do you think the angry Gromarian could be a musical? I thought about those musical parodies
*26:10.580- 26:15.520* :  that I said, yeah, I think it could just write a story around it and then yeah, we could be
*26:21.960- 26:27.200* :  off to the races for that. If you were an angry Gromarian, what makes you angry?
*26:27.860- 26:33.300* :  What makes me angry? I get angry when folks, they don't use language correctly, but also when
*26:33.300- 26:36.860* :  they're too precious about language. I think that there's a middle ground that one should take.
*26:37.000- 26:41.120* :  Things like the rule that says you can't end a sentence with a preposition or you can't split
*26:41.120- 26:46.540* :  an incentive. These are things that we all learned in school growing up and I would just say,
*26:46.700- 26:51.920* :  why? Why can't you do that? The answer that folks would give is that is the rule and it became a
*26:51.920- 26:57.260* :  rule because you can't do it in Latin, but that's a really dumb reason for a rule about English.
*26:58.220- 27:03.780* :  Give us an example of some of the music. I mean, I listened to a small portion of a song from the
*27:03.780- 27:11.080* :  musical before we spoke called Whom Cares. Every single line in that song has some sort of
*27:11.080- 27:15.720* :  grammatical or language error and I have to say that was actually probably the hardest song in
*27:15.720- 27:21.000* :  the show to write, first to just assemble a catalog of that many errors and then make them rhyme.
*27:21.800- 27:26.800* :  Jeffrey Berg speaking to Julian Warwicker. Four months ahead of the Olympic Games, the City of
*27:26.800- 27:35.720* :  Paris is renewing another old sporting tradition, the annual race of cafe waiters, the aim to find
*27:35.720- 27:42.300* :  the fastest waiter to carry a breakfast tray over a distance without any spillage. The race was
*27:42.300- 27:48.160* :  abandoned several years ago, but now it's been revived as Huescofield explains. Today there are
*27:48.160- 27:53.120* :  waiters races in cities across the globe, but it's generally accepted that they're all pale
*27:53.120- 27:58.400* :  imitations of the original, which was started here in Paris just before the First World War.
*27:58.740- 28:03.940* :  And this morning, once again, more than 200 waiters and waiters will be competing over a two
*28:03.940- 28:09.140* :  kilometre course through the historic Maray quarter. They'll be dressed formally in white
*28:09.140- 28:15.200* :  top and apron and on each tray will be posed a Quasor, a cup of coffee and a glass of tap water.
*28:15.640- 28:20.460* :  Only fast walking, not running, is allowed and judges at the end will be checking the amount of
*28:20.620- 28:25.580* :  liquid that has spilled, not quite an Olympic sport, but there is a link. Ahead of the July
*28:25.580- 28:31.360* :  Games, the City wants to show off the footwork, the energy, and the fine balancing skills that have
*28:31.360- 28:37.100* :  helped make its bestros and brasseries so famous around the world. Huescofield in Paris.
*28:37.260- 28:41.540* :  And if you think that's hard, spare a thought for Scottish runner Jasmine Paris.
*28:42.060- 28:46.340* :  Despite her name, she's not been racing in the French capital, but in one of the world's
*28:46.340- 28:53.280* :  hardest ultra-marathons, becoming the first woman to complete the grueling 160 kilometre
*28:53.280- 29:00.300* :  course, that's 100 miles, in the US state of Tennessee, just inside the allotted 60 hours.
*29:01.080- 29:07.760* :  Only 20 men have managed the same feat. Simon Jones reports on the 40-year-old vet's remarkable
*29:07.760- 29:15.120* :  achievement. As Jasmine Paris completed the course with just 99 seconds to spare,
