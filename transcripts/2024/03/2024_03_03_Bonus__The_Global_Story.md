*02:13.400- 02:19.700* :  Today is the Republican Party's alliance with the anti-abortion movement still a safe electoral
*02:19.700- 02:28.160* :  bet. In 2016 Donald Trump promised to overturn abortion protections and he did just that,
*02:28.820- 02:34.780* :  but now after a controversial ruling in Alabama he seems to be trying to walk a final line.
*02:35.480- 02:42.120* :  Has Donald Trump gone soft on abortion? If so, why? And does it dampen the issue Democrats
*02:42.120- 02:45.960* :  believed could push Joe Biden's skeptics out to vote for him?
*02:50.260- 02:55.860* :  With me today are Nomiya Ikbal, the BBC's North America correspondent based in Washington DC.
*02:56.400- 03:00.280* :  Hi Nomiya again, it's so nice to chat to you again. And to you Katya.
*03:01.220- 03:07.000* :  And also with us Barbara Cavallo, director of polling at Marist Poll at Marist College in New York,
*03:07.020- 03:12.280* :  they regularly conduct political polls with major American broadcasters like MPR,
*03:12.280- 03:19.220* :  PBS and NBC. Hello to you Barbara. Hello, very nice to meet you and to be with you today.
*03:19.740- 03:25.320* :  First of all, just before we dive into this debate, I just wonder just local polling, literally
*03:25.320- 03:32.140* :  personal polling. The two of you is abortion in the US, something that regularly pops up into
*03:32.140- 03:37.220* :  conversation between you, your family, your friends. It isn't an issue that comes up a lot,
*03:37.260- 03:43.340* :  but with this ruling in Alabama where the state has decided that frozen embryos can now be classified
*03:43.340- 03:49.920* :  as humans, it sparks the whole debate again. I'm seeing that with people that I speak to in my area.
*03:50.760- 03:54.660* :  What about you Barbara, because I have to say, I mean, you know, I'm quite far away from you
*03:54.660- 04:00.620* :  in Belgium, but I have two teenage daughters and they are talking about the United States and
*04:00.620- 04:05.620* :  abortion. It's really got them and their friends talking about women's rights over their body
*04:05.620- 04:12.140* :  or not. Oh, absolutely. And it is an incredibly intense issue here in the United States.
*04:12.640- 04:18.760* :  And since the overturning of Roe v Wade, everything has gone back to the states and the states have
*04:18.760- 04:22.940* :  been particularly the red states, the Republican states have been incredibly conservative.
*04:23.800- 04:29.320* :  And so as those rulings have come down and that those laws have been changed in those states,
*04:29.320- 04:35.840* :  it becomes a topic of conversation that whenever you talk either politics or about the election
*04:35.840- 04:42.600* :  or almost anything comes to the fore. You mentioned Roe v Wade, Barbara. Roe v Wade, of course,
*04:42.600- 04:49.280* :  is the case that enshrined it in the US Constitution to make it legal for a woman to have an abortion.
*04:49.280- 04:55.780* :  That was overturned by the US Supreme Court. Let's just go back to June 24, 2022 when that happened.
*04:56.280- 05:01.320* :  I distinctly remember being outside the Supreme Court because of course we were covering it
*05:01.420- 05:07.760* :  for the BBC. And I was just so struck by how polarizing the issue was.
*05:12.300- 05:19.160* :  I'm 21 and I'm terrified. I'm one today. I've seen the devastation abortion has
*05:19.160- 05:24.900* :  wrought on our country on a communal level and on a personal level. I'm from the UK. I'm from
*05:24.900- 05:32.000* :  a past the world where abortion access is just you can have it. It's not a divisive issue in the UK
*05:32.000- 05:37.220* :  in the way that so many other issues are, but in America it was so polarizing. So you had hundreds
*05:37.220- 05:43.540* :  of people outside, pro-choice groups, anti-abortion groups, and they were being separated by police.
*05:43.540- 05:49.660* :  But I think what I remember very distinctly was anti-abortion groups saying this is not the end.
*05:49.720- 05:54.720* :  We are going to work out of this momentum. We're going to keep going. We're going to keep fighting
*05:54.720- 05:59.560* :  and we're going to build up better work. Of course, there was celebration in the victory. It was a
*05:59.560- 06:05.660* :  result of decades of work and their goal was to overturn Roe v Wade, but they were also talking
*06:05.660- 06:13.100* :  about they want to see a contraception band, medicated abortion. Basically their message was,
*06:13.140- 06:18.940* :  we're not just going to pack up and go home. I think ultimately their goal is to ban abortion
*06:19.600- 06:23.200* :  nationally, just to ban it outright in America, whether that's politically possible, I think
*06:23.200- 06:28.240* :  there's another issue. And then for the pro-choice groups, and bear in mind there are lots of
*06:28.240- 06:33.000* :  Republican women I met that day who had come from other states to say, my body, my choice,
*06:33.000- 06:38.120* :  governments stay out of my business. And they were all saying to me, we are going to fight this
*06:38.320- 06:43.500* :  at the ballot box. That this is now a major motivator for us when it comes to the elections.
*06:44.460- 06:50.520* :  It's really interesting, Nomiya, because you said that there was that really divided emotional
*06:50.520- 06:58.020* :  opinion outside the court. You also mentioned the case just now in Alabama. Tell us a little bit more
*06:58.020- 07:04.760* :  about that, please. And do you think it fit into those pro-life plans? Basically the Supreme Court
*07:04.760- 07:11.160* :  in Alabama decided, and this was of a case that was brought in 2020 involving three couples
*07:12.020- 07:17.420* :  whose frozen embryos were dropped by accident in the clinic. And the court rule that frozen
*07:17.420- 07:24.380* :  embryos created through IVF and now considered children under state law, it means that lots of
*07:24.380- 07:30.200* :  families and clinics are potentially exposed to criminal charges or punitive damages. Just to
*07:30.200- 07:35.120* :  remind people that might not know the sort of the details of IVF, but you have to collect as many
*07:35.120- 07:41.440* :  eggs as possible, which are then fertilized. Some of those eggs would not make it after implantation
*07:41.440- 07:46.080* :  in the uterus because of abnormalities or there are other health factors. And so they're discarded.
*07:46.080- 07:52.100* :  But under this new law, what does that mean? Does that mean that you could be prosecuted for manslaughter?
*07:52.800- 07:55.640* :  And then there are other questions. What if there's a power cut and suddenly clinics
*07:56.480- 08:01.540* :  find that the frozen embryos are thawed out? Does that mean they're now open to being prosecuted
*08:01.540- 08:09.120* :  for murder, manslaughter? This created so much confusion amongst clinics. And more significantly,
*08:09.120- 08:15.380* :  it created a backlash amongst those very people who are anti-abortion. They said to me that
*08:15.980- 08:22.460* :  IVF is about as pro-life as you can get. Nobody understands more that that embryo
*08:22.880- 08:26.740* :  is not a child more than the person that is yearning for that embryo to be a child.
*08:26.860- 08:32.740* :  So you have a very divided religious constituency as a result of what happened in Alabama.
*08:33.120- 08:38.740* :  Do you see this in your polling, Barbara, that it's assumed that Republicans, I mean,
*08:38.740- 08:43.020* :  of course, it's a lot of individuals in the United States, but Republicans are pro-life.
*08:43.020- 08:49.520* :  But actually, are they divided when it comes to life? I think all through all, Americans have
*08:49.520- 08:56.540* :  actually had more of a consensus on abortion. Most Americans want abortion to be legal,
*08:56.940- 09:01.660* :  regardless of their political party. Now, certainly, Democrats and Independents
*09:02.300- 09:07.760* :  are more likely to hold that opinion. But there was a consensus that abortion should be legal
*09:07.760- 09:13.900* :  and that there should be significant restrictions to abortion. But I think what has really changed
*09:13.900- 09:20.940* :  the debate here are these state laws that not only have restricted abortion to just beyond
*09:20.940- 09:26.640* :  sometimes the first trimester and sometimes not even during the first trimester,
*09:27.080- 09:34.120* :  they have also eliminated any exceptions to those laws. So in cases of rape, in cases of
*09:34.120- 09:40.600* :  incest, in cases where the life of the mother may be at state. So that has changed the debate
*09:40.600- 09:47.560* :  incredibly. And I think that perhaps Republicans have underestimated the intensity of the
*09:47.560- 09:52.920* :  feeling about abortion. So let's unpack this because, of course, we are in the year of a
*09:52.920- 09:56.560* :  presidential election. I think there's probably not one person on the planet that doesn't know that
*09:56.560- 10:01.320* :  about the United States this year, which means that Republicans and Democrats are
*10:01.860- 10:07.300* :  frantically looking at opinion polls like yours, Barbara. So let's have a look at some of the
*10:07.300- 10:15.080* :  strategy. First, I'd like to wind back the clock to Donald Trump when he was very outspoken
*10:15.500- 10:23.860* :  about overturning Roe v Wade. Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.
*10:26.740- 10:35.340* :  We know that every human soul is divine in every human life. Born and unborn is made in the holy
*10:35.340- 10:41.860* :  image of Almighty God. Now, Nomea, after the case in Alabama that you were talking about,
*10:41.860- 10:49.320* :  Donald Trump was very, very quick to come out in public and say he disagreed with that ruling.
*10:49.760- 10:54.600* :  We want to make it easier for mothers and fathers to have babies not hotter, you know,
*10:54.600- 11:01.260* :  that like the overwhelming majority of Americans, including the vast majority of Republican
*11:01.260- 11:08.020* :  conservatives, Christians and pro-life Americans, I strongly support the availability of
*11:08.020- 11:14.460* :  IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious little beautiful baby. What do you think was going
*11:14.460- 11:19.660* :  on there? It was unsurprising because he clearly sensed a political backlash. He was actually on
*11:19.660- 11:25.400* :  the campaign trail in South Carolina when he made the comments about supporting IVF. And I spoke to
*11:25.400- 11:29.760* :  one of my colleagues who was in South Carolina covering the primary, I was in Alabama. She told me
*11:29.760- 11:36.180* :  that she asked a lot of Republican women, particularly those who support Donald Trump and what they
*11:36.180- 11:41.420* :  thought of IVF. And she said every single one of them that they supported it, they believe that
*11:41.680- 11:48.900* :  you should be able to have a child in any way that you can. And so you can see why the Republicans
*11:48.900- 11:52.960* :  like Donald Trump suddenly thought, oh, wait, wait a minute, IVF is something that's very popular
*11:52.960- 11:59.580* :  and it must be protected. I think he's trying to have it both ways in some respects. He has blame
*11:59.580- 12:05.440* :  conservative activists in the past on abortion for costing Republicans at the ballot box,
*12:05.440- 12:10.780* :  but he also likes to boast about his anti-abortion legacy. When I was an Iowa for the primary
*12:10.780- 12:16.020* :  earlier this year, the first real test of Donald Trump's hole in the Republican party, he was
*12:16.020- 12:21.660* :  running ads calling himself the most pro-life president ever. But I think on the major litmus test
*12:21.660- 12:27.880* :  for anti-abortion activists, which is the support for a national ban, he's very, very non-committal.
*12:28.280- 12:33.160* :  But he is politically astute. We know that about Donald Trump and he knows that IVF
*12:33.640- 12:38.840* :  access is something very, very important to conservative people. He sensed the winds was blowing
*12:38.840- 12:43.640* :  that way and that's why he came out with that comment, I think. Well, even if he does sense
*12:43.680- 12:47.680* :  whether winds blowing and I'd like to get to his political team in just a moment,
*12:48.960- 12:53.620* :  is it fair to say he didn't sense it when it came to the midterms? The Republicans got pretty
*12:53.620- 12:59.280* :  lackluster results. Some and Barbara, maybe you can know from your polling, blamed the Republican
*12:59.280- 13:05.260* :  stance on abortion and Donald Trump's outspokeness, including on that very issue.
*13:05.980- 13:11.780* :  I think the Republicans had certainly underestimated the intensity of the issue and the fact
*13:11.780- 13:18.840* :  that it hasn't waned. There have been discussions about overturning Roe v Wade for the last couple
*13:19.380- 13:25.360* :  of cycles and I don't think that until the ruling, those kinds of issues hit hold.
*13:26.120- 13:32.160* :  We've had other issues that have been polarizing, guns are very polarizing, other social issues,
*13:32.160- 13:37.300* :  immigration certainly on the Republican side is an incredibly mobilizing issue. But I think
*13:37.300- 13:44.440* :  they have underestimated the fact that abortion has stayed on the political agenda with the
*13:44.440- 13:52.380* :  intensity that it has. And there's no question that these state legislator changes that have
*13:52.380- 13:59.820* :  been going on are national in scope in terms of impacting voters. It's not just about Alabama,
*13:59.820- 14:04.400* :  it becomes the Republican party and it becomes nationalized.
*14:07.040- 14:10.840* :  So Nomiya, what happened between the midterms and now? Because if I'm not mistaken,
*14:10.860- 14:16.160* :  you did hear muttering amongst Republicans at the time, blaming Donald Trump for being so
*14:16.160- 14:23.200* :  outspoken, so extreme on divisive issues like abortion and some kind of indicating they wish
*14:23.200- 14:28.960* :  he'd just go away. And yet we hear him at the moment, sounding more nuanced. He's kept away from
*14:28.960- 14:36.820* :  promoting the idea of having a nationwide ban on abortion. Is this new team that he has behind
*14:36.820- 14:40.900* :  him and they lead up to the presidential elections? We looked at it on one of our past episodes
*14:40.900- 14:45.740* :  meet Donald Trump's in a circle. I think trying to keep Donald Trump on message will always
*14:45.740- 14:53.040* :  probably be a tricky endeavor for any team that works within. And yes, you know, for Republicans,
*14:53.040- 14:57.420* :  they had such a poor showing in the midterm elections. There were seven consecutive ballot measures,
*14:57.420- 15:01.680* :  I believe, including in conservative states where voters favored abortion rights. I remember being
*15:01.900- 15:08.800* :  Kansas when they upheld abortion rights. A very conservative state that was in 2022 just after
*15:08.800- 15:14.720* :  Roe v. Wade. It was seen as the first test of Roe v. Wade. For Donald Trump, it's a case of trying
*15:14.720- 15:20.920* :  to articulate the message, which is going to be the challenge because, look, there are plenty of
*15:20.920- 15:25.540* :  people in this country who still believe in banning abortion evangelicals who are a key voting
*15:25.540- 15:30.980* :  blockie of hardline conservatives. But for Donald Trump, it's going to be interesting to see how
*15:30.980- 15:36.520* :  he balances the message. I'm speculating here. I wouldn't be totally surprised if he tries to
*15:36.520- 15:41.380* :  ignore it and focuses on other issues that Americans are really fired up about, particularly
*15:41.380- 15:45.420* :  immigration. I think that's going to be a massive issue going into the election. I think he's
*15:45.420- 15:51.220* :  going to obviously go on about President Biden's age as well. For the primaries, he's been, he knows
*15:51.220- 15:56.740* :  that he's going to get the Republican voters on board. And so he has tried to sort of position
*15:56.740- 16:00.960* :  himself, as I said, the most pro-life president ever. But when it comes to the general American
*16:00.960- 16:05.320* :  electorate, when we get into the election campaigning, you know, if, and I think he's expected to get
*16:05.320- 16:09.420* :  the Republican presidential nomination, I don't know exactly what the message will be then because
*16:09.420- 16:15.720* :  he will really have to balance it. So we've looked at the legal ruling in Alabama that exposed
*16:15.720- 16:21.400* :  divisions in the Republican anti-abortion movement. We've chatted about Donald Trump and Republican
*16:21.400- 16:27.140* :  strategy in general to kind of dance on two weddings, court the anti-abortion voters, but not
*16:27.140- 16:33.220* :  alienate pro-IVF or a little bit more mainstream. Next I want to look at Democrat hopes that the abortion
*16:33.300- 16:37.340* :  issue could help swing them. The election, are they dreaming?

*18:13.180- 18:21.140* :  and also Barbara Cavallo, director of Marist Poll. Barbara, is it fair to say that the fact that
*18:21.140- 18:26.440* :  the Democrats performed well in the midterms is largely, you know, many say down to the abortion
*18:26.440- 18:33.140* :  issue? I think that abortion is an incredibly mobilizing issue for Democrats. The Democratic Party
*18:33.720- 18:39.280* :  here in the United States is a very diverse party. And it's very difficult for them to find
*18:39.280- 18:45.220* :  issues where they can have a consensus and where the significant proportion of Democrats will
*18:45.220- 18:53.500* :  agree. Abortion is that issue for them. It makes sense for them to continue to stoke the fires
*18:53.820- 19:01.900* :  of Democrats. And certainly the Republicans are helping them do that as we go from state to state
*19:01.900- 19:08.620* :  and we see a number of Republican governors and legislatures with anti-abortion legislation
*19:08.880- 19:13.920* :  and policy, you know, each of those decisions, each of that legislation that passes becomes
*19:13.920- 19:20.580* :  national news. In Texas, Tennessee, Idaho and Oklahoma near total bans on abortion are now in place.
*19:21.160- 19:26.460* :  And is a benefit to the Democrats. Most of these politicians don't even understand how a woman's
*19:26.460- 19:33.780* :  body actually works. But abortion for the Democrats goes beyond the Democratic base. It goes to
*19:33.780- 19:40.020* :  Republican women, suburban women who may not identify as Republicans, but identify as
*19:40.020- 19:46.180* :  independents and often vote Republican. And that is a very significant swing constituency.
*19:46.900- 19:53.500* :  Can it make Democrat voters who are not really inspired by Joe Biden and maybe weren't going
*19:53.500- 19:57.960* :  to bother voting this time round? Can it push them out to vote? So can it get new votes
*19:58.620- 20:05.380* :  towards the Democrats basically? It may not change opinions, but what it will do is it will
*20:05.380- 20:11.440* :  determine who turns out to the polls. I mean, certainly Donald Trump is concerned. He has
*20:11.880- 20:17.700* :  moderated his position. In fact, coming out with a proposal that perhaps abortion should be
*20:17.700- 20:24.820* :  allowed up to 16 weeks. I think the Republicans speak very inarticulately about this object.
*20:25.180- 20:29.220* :  I watched some of them without the exceptions, et cetera, et cetera. I said,
*20:30.680- 20:34.720* :  other than certain parts of the country, you can't, you're not going to win on this issue,
*20:35.100- 20:40.740* :  but you will win on this issue when you come up with the right number of weeks.
*20:40.860- 20:45.540* :  It's a mobilizing issue in the sense that it's going to determine whether people show up
*20:45.540- 20:49.560* :  at the polls. And it's not just the president that is on the line in November.
*20:50.080- 20:57.440* :  We have the entire House of Representatives. We have a third of the Senate and many local elections
*20:57.440- 21:05.220* :  as well. And so I think the cost to Republicans may be on those lower ballot races.
*21:05.720- 21:09.620* :  That's so fascinating, Barbara, and it's right. We really have to look at the bigger picture.
*21:09.620- 21:14.220* :  It's tempting just to look at the two dare I say older boxes in the ring.
*21:14.720- 21:18.460* :  What I found really interesting in Alabama, speaking to one particular woman,
*21:18.460- 21:23.200* :  32 years of age, she's said to me she never talks to the press. It's not who she is.
*21:23.200- 21:28.100* :  She's very quiet, likes the quiet life. She has a young son. She's trying for another baby.
*21:28.100- 21:33.440* :  She has unexplained fertility. And IVF was her option. And she was due to have an appointment
*21:33.440- 21:39.520* :  when that ruling came down by Alabama's Supreme Court. And she said to me, I'm writing letters
*21:40.320- 21:46.060* :  and emails to representatives, to senators, to everybody that I can think of. And she said to me,
*21:46.060- 21:50.660* :  that's not who I am. And she said, my friends, my family would be shocked to hear that I am
*21:50.660- 21:57.520* :  actively campaigning. She's planning to go to the capital as well in Alabama. And now whether or
*21:57.520- 22:03.240* :  or not she would go all the way and vote for a Democrat, I don't know. But I just think her story
*22:03.240- 22:08.480* :  was really interesting in the sense that she said, this is the only thing I can think about now.
*22:08.660- 22:13.020* :  This is the only thing I'm thinking about. What else could happen as a result of this decision?
*22:13.020- 22:18.820* :  And it's going to be the thing that is on my mind for 2024. And if you have lots of people
*22:18.820- 22:23.780* :  thinking like that, I don't know how much of a difference it will make because I don't think
*22:23.780- 22:27.920* :  Democrats should just rely on abortion ballot initiatives to help them because, you know,
*22:27.920- 22:33.120* :  I mentioned Kansas earlier, when voters decisively upheld abortion rights in every single case,
*22:33.120- 22:37.860* :  those margins were actually driven by Republican voters but they also voted for Republican candidates.
*22:37.860- 22:44.100* :  But I just think that if you get people like the woman that I spoke to feeling this fired up,
*22:44.100- 22:49.580* :  it could spell a bit of trouble for Republicans. And I think they know that, which is why you're
*22:49.580- 22:54.580* :  guessing a lot of them coming out and sort of trying to draw some red lines on on on reproductive
*22:55.280- 22:59.680* :  rights and saying, IVF is fine. We're okay with that. I had a lot of people come in my office and
*22:59.840- 23:06.640* :  Montgomery and have explained to me their their situations that this is the only option they have
*23:06.640- 23:11.920* :  for a family and it's in jeopardy. And it became one of those things that it became a priority
*23:11.920- 23:17.340* :  because I knew that as a physician, I needed to help out and figure out a way to, you know,
*23:17.340- 23:21.960* :  preserve the safety of life, but still giving reasonable solutions to some difficult questions.
*23:24.960- 23:30.040* :  Nobby, I've wanted to ask you before we move on. You travel all around the United States as part of
*23:30.040- 23:35.140* :  your job. You've been looking particularly at IVF and the abortion argument at the moment because
*23:35.140- 23:40.580* :  of the ruling in Alabama. Traditionally, we think when it comes to a big election, like the
*23:40.580- 23:46.760* :  presidential election or general election, in the end it comes down to the economy and not what
*23:46.760- 23:51.800* :  some might see as more side issues like abortion. What's the sense that you're getting on the ground?
*23:52.400- 23:56.940* :  I think you're right there and I don't know if Democrats think that abortion rights is a
*23:56.940- 24:00.020* :  still the bullet for them because there's so many other issues. You're right, the economy,
*24:00.020- 24:05.620* :  immigration, also the amount of money America's spending in Ukraine and Israel, all of these
*24:05.620- 24:12.120* :  issues are coming up. The thing with abortion, it does come up. It does still come up for a loss
*24:12.120- 24:19.560* :  of people because it's so personal. And getting rid of Roe v Wade, I think, was one thing, but now
*24:19.560- 24:25.520* :  seeing the sort of real world consequences where you've got people who are facing unexpected
*24:25.520- 24:30.600* :  pregnancies in conservative states and they don't want to have those keep those pregnancies either
*24:30.600- 24:37.500* :  because it was through rape or incest or it's also risking their health, you do see that that
*24:37.500- 24:43.660* :  is a big issue for people. So whether or not it will actually be the thing that decides it for
*24:43.660- 24:46.420* :  them, I don't know. And of course it all depends on the key swing states.
*24:46.940- 24:52.900* :  Barbara, is abortion a significant issue in these swing states? Arizona, Florida, Georgia,
*24:52.900- 24:59.520* :  Nevada? Well, I think you're correct. Let the economy and other issues do rise to the surface.
*25:00.140- 25:06.940* :  Here in the United States, inflation is down. The economy is certainly getting better. People are
*25:06.980- 25:14.280* :  worried about it, but not with the intensity that they were last summer. And so as things
*25:14.280- 25:20.180* :  even out a little bit on some of those issues that people generally tend to vote on,
*25:20.660- 25:26.300* :  these other more social and cultural issues really come to the fore. What I'm seeing are two
*25:26.300- 25:31.700* :  very significant issues, immigration on the Republican side and abortion for the Democrats.
*25:32.440- 25:38.260* :  Certainly in the swing states, what makes them swing states is the fact that they have a more
*25:38.260- 25:44.520* :  even balance between Democrats and Republicans, but certainly probably the most significant thing
*25:44.520- 25:51.220* :  is the motivation. And who ends up turning out? Nomi, can we expect that you will be spending a very
*25:51.220- 25:57.340* :  large portion of your time between now and November in these swing states? I think that's one of
*25:57.340- 26:02.080* :  the plans. And once we work out which swing states, there will be, I think there's a general
*26:02.080- 26:09.480* :  feeling Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, perhaps Pennsylvania as well. And to sort of test how people
*26:09.480- 26:14.520* :  feel about a whole range of issues as well. But yeah, that's ultimately where the election is
*26:14.520- 26:18.800* :  decided. But it will be interesting to see what issues matter to people. There's so much on the
*26:18.800- 26:23.580* :  plate this year. I actually can't keep up with exactly what issue we think is going to be the
*26:23.580- 26:28.940* :  deciding one. But yeah, the swing states is always the key place to be in election year.
*26:29.380- 26:32.880* :  Which means it's the key place for you to be. And I hope that you'll take us with us to keep
*26:32.880- 26:38.700* :  us up to date as well as you go. And you too, Barbara, thank you so much, Nomiya and Barbara,

*27:27.040- 27:32.840* :  For just as long as Hollywood has been Tinseltown, there have been suspicions about what lurks
*27:32.840- 27:39.720* :  behind the glitz and glamour. And for a while, those suspicions grew into something much bigger and
*27:39.900- 27:44.580* :  much darker. Are you a member of the Communist Party? Or have you ever been a member of the Communist
