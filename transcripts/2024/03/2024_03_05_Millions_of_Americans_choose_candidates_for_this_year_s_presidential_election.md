*01:08.220- 01:11.640* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:14.600- 01:19.540* :  I'm Rachel Wright in the early hours of Wednesday 6th of March. These are our main stories.
*01:19.540- 01:24.680* :  US voters cast their ballots in the largest one-day prize of the nomination calendar.
*01:25.220- 01:29.800* :  France's president goes to Prague to look for support in his bid to aid Ukraine.
*01:29.900- 01:35.460* :  President Biden tells Israel there are no excuses for not allowing more aid into Gaza.
*01:38.400- 01:39.660* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:43.600- 01:48.840* :  Arcif is our city. We want there to be life here, including a cultural life.
*01:49.700- 01:56.080* :  After two years of near silence, the Arcif National Opera and Ballet is about to reopen underground.
*02:01.400- 02:06.560* :  It's usually called Super Tuesday, the day when the shape of the race to be a candidate in the
*02:06.560- 02:12.400* :  US presidential election becomes clear, even if the actual candidates aren't fully decided upon.
*02:12.960- 02:16.980* :  This year, not so much. With both the candidates at the last election,
*02:16.980- 02:22.280* :  apparently cruising to victory, some are calling Super Tuesday, snooze are Tuesday.
*02:22.940- 02:26.240* :  As we recorded this podcast, voting was still continuing,
*02:26.240- 02:31.260* :  we'll bring you the results in our next edition. But to get a taste of how things were going,
*02:31.260- 02:34.980* :  I spoke to our correspondent, Gary O'Donohue, in Richmond, Virginia.
*02:35.520- 02:39.500* :  I certainly think this little corner of Richmond, Virginia, where I am in a polling station,
*02:39.500- 02:45.440* :  that sort of apathy, if you like, is reflected in the numbers that the polling staff here tell me
*02:45.440- 02:50.100* :  that they've just had around 15 per cent of registered voters in this precinct coming into
*02:50.520- 02:54.560* :  a voting, one of the two primaries, they would have expected it around 40 per cent.
*02:54.560- 02:59.620* :  So a real significant dip in enthusiasm. We'll see if that's reflected across the country,
*02:59.620- 03:03.420* :  but certainly the sense in which these two contests are wrapped up already,
*03:03.600- 03:07.860* :  which they wouldn't normally by this stage in the election, I think is having an impact.
*03:08.420- 03:12.080* :  So what if any are the main issues that people have been campaigning on?
*03:12.840- 03:17.000* :  Well, there's been very little campaigning here, a very little sign of any kind of, you know,
*03:17.700- 03:22.420* :  yard signs or billboards or anything like that. In fact, some of the polling officials
*03:22.940- 03:27.140* :  centrally have been bemoaning the fact that there's been very little awareness by the political
*03:27.140- 03:31.500* :  parties. People here, though, I mean, I talked to a few Democrats just a moment ago,
*03:32.200- 03:38.040* :  very concerned about Joe Biden's age. One said that Gaza was a drag on the ticket for the
*03:38.040- 03:42.820* :  Democrats. So while they're voting for their favorite candidate, they're not doing it with any great
*03:43.220- 03:48.220* :  enthusiasm, certainly on the Democratic side. And of course, with Nikki Haley still in the race
*03:48.220- 03:53.220* :  against Donald Trump, there is still a residue of people supporting her. And the big question,
*03:53.220- 03:58.020* :  I think, after tonight is, where does that support go? Does it just swing back behind Donald Trump,
*03:58.020- 04:02.820* :  or are these people that really don't want to see Donald Trump back in the White House and
*04:02.860- 04:07.500* :  become sort of independent voters in November, possibly even switch over to the Democrats?
*04:08.260- 04:14.680* :  Gary O'Donohue in Virginia. The French president Emmanuel Macron has said Ukraine's European
*04:14.680- 04:21.000* :  allies must not be cowards. Speaking on a visit to Prague, Mr. Macron reiterated support for
*04:21.000- 04:26.320* :  a check initiative to replenish Ukraine's heavily depleted arsenal and repeated the need for
*04:26.320- 04:29.720* :  what he called a strategic surge in support for Ukraine.
*04:33.300- 04:37.900* :  Or is it not our war? Can we look away and let things unravel?
*04:38.920- 04:44.680* :  I don't think so. I called for a strategic surge and I stand by that fully.
*04:45.620- 04:51.040* :  We need to be realistic about the situation that's unfolding in Europe and what we need to stand
*04:51.040- 04:57.240* :  up for. That could include a check proposal to buy artillery shells from outside the European
*04:57.240- 05:02.960* :  Union to be sent to Ukraine because Europe can't meet its needs. Our correspondent in Prague
*05:02.960- 05:09.920* :  Rob Cameron told me more. Those remarks in that address after meeting President Pavel,
*05:10.220- 05:17.060* :  were really festooned with rhetorical flourishes. In fact, President Macron started the
*05:17.060- 05:23.040* :  visit to Prague with even more rhetorical flourishes when he addressed members of the French
*05:23.040- 05:29.880* :  community gathered at Prague Castle before he sat down with President Pavel. In that speech,
*05:29.880- 05:35.760* :  he said that we're certainly approaching a time in Europe when we must not be cowards.
*05:36.100- 05:40.700* :  This is something I think very much that President Pavel is a former military man and a former
*05:40.700- 05:46.240* :  very senior figure in NATO. He is completely on board. He agrees that this is not the time for
*05:46.240- 05:52.480* :  cowards and this is time to be bold and to stand together and not to limit ourselves,
*05:52.620- 05:58.760* :  limit the Western powers in their response to what's happening in Ukraine.
*05:59.140- 06:03.180* :  So is there a sense that France and the Czech Republic are working together for a more
*06:03.180- 06:07.260* :  interventionalist approach to Ukraine? I think there is. I think it's fair to say that.
*06:07.260- 06:13.420* :  Obviously, President Macron will be criticized for grandstanding and as you say,
*06:13.420- 06:20.480* :  this very powerful rhetoric, but there is really something behind it because France is now on board
*06:20.480- 06:27.660* :  with this Czech proposal to obtain up to 800,000 artillery shells for Ukraine outside the European
*06:27.660- 06:34.320* :  Union. President Macron has dropped opposition to EU money being used to buy shells from outside
*06:34.320- 06:39.680* :  Europe. He even says that the EU is European peace facility and that's a fund with a ceiling of
*06:39.680- 06:48.000* :  12 billion euros in it could be used to support the Czech plan. So he is, I think, putting his money
*06:48.000- 06:54.060* :  where his mouth is. It's not just rhetoric and I believe you're listening to his words and to
*06:54.060- 06:59.440* :  the things that the French government joining the Canadians, the Danes, the Belgians, the Dutch,
*06:59.440- 07:06.780* :  the Lithuanians and others are signing up to with this Czech initiative to get artillery ammunition
*07:06.780- 07:13.680* :  to Ukraine. Rob Cameron in Prague. Now, despite that lack of ammunition, Ukraine has reported a big
*07:13.680- 07:20.100* :  military success. It says it has sunk a Russian patrol ship in the Black Sea near annexed
*07:20.100- 07:25.660* :  Crimea. It would add to the more than 20 Russian vessels Ukraine has destroyed since the full-scale
*07:25.660- 07:30.680* :  invasion two years ago. This report from Abdul-Jalil, Abdul-Rassilov and Kiev.
*07:31.460- 07:36.520* :  Kiev claims that the attack took place near the Kurds straight in the territorial waters of
*07:36.520- 07:42.960* :  Ukraine. A video released by the Ukrainian military intelligence agency appears to show the moment
*07:42.960- 07:49.480* :  when the ship was hit. It is thought five naval drones were involved in the attack that lasted
*07:49.480- 07:56.240* :  for more than 40 minutes. Ukraine claims seven crew members were killed and six injured.
*07:57.620- 08:02.600* :  Moscow's silence on this attack probably means one thing. The ship was destroyed.
*08:04.000- 08:09.680* :  Separately, the international criminal court has issued an arrest warrant for two Russian senior
*08:09.680- 08:15.780* :  commanders. They accuse of war crimes and crimes against humanity for allegedly directing
*08:15.780- 08:22.660* :  air strikes on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. Abdul-Jalil Abdul-Rassilov in Kiev.
*08:23.500- 08:29.300* :  President Biden has told Israel there are no excuses for not allowing more aid into Gaza.
*08:29.800- 08:34.700* :  Israel's bombardment in the territory has led to widespread shortages of food, water,
*08:34.700- 08:39.960* :  and medicine. Speaking to reporters as it was about to board Air Force One, Mr. Biden warned
*08:39.980- 08:43.540* :  of serious consequences if there was no deal within the next week.
*09:07.760- 09:12.720* :  The President's call for a ceasefire comes as a senior member of Israel's war cabinet Benny
*09:12.720- 09:18.500* :  Gantz was in Washington to meet U.S. leaders. Mr. Gantz is viewed as a big rival of the
*09:18.500- 09:24.360* :  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a correspondent in Jerusalem where a Davis gave us
*09:24.360- 09:30.760* :  this update. I think it's far too early to even express hope that there will be a ceasefire
*09:30.760- 09:35.360* :  because there's so much between the two sides, even if they get around the table at the minute,
*09:35.360- 09:41.740* :  Israel's even refusing to go to Cairo because it says that Hamas hasn't provided this list,
*09:41.740- 09:46.840* :  this definitive list of hostages who are still alive and would be released as part of a swap with
*09:46.840- 09:53.100* :  Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. But even assuming they do sit down in these indirect talks
*09:53.100- 09:58.840* :  with mediators from the U.S. Qatar and Egypt, there are still some pretty big obstacles in the way.
*09:58.840- 10:05.140* :  For example, Hamas would like Israeli troops to withdraw from Gaza and is insisting that Palestinians
*10:05.140- 10:10.160* :  should be allowed to return to their home areas in northern Gaza in the event of a ceasefire.
*10:10.480- 10:16.300* :  And I find those demands will be very difficult for Israel to agree to. So any hopes or any pressure
*10:16.300- 10:22.240* :  from outside for a ceasefire agreement to be agreed before the start of Ramadan at the end of
*10:22.240- 10:27.740* :  this weekend are still some way off but as you're intimating and as we heard there from Joe Biden,
*10:27.900- 10:31.600* :  there is a lot of pressure particularly from the Americans for some sort of breakthrough.
*10:32.360- 10:38.620* :  We're at Davis in Jerusalem and we go next to next door Lebanon where the course of true love
*10:38.620- 10:44.340* :  never did run smooth but those looking for the perfect partner in Lebanon may find themselves
*10:44.340- 10:50.900* :  swiping right on a forbidden date. GPS in Lebanon has been disrupted so badly by the Israel
*10:50.900- 10:57.140* :  Hamas war that it is matching users in Beirut with potential dates in neighbouring Israel which
*10:57.140- 11:03.680* :  is not allowed under Lebanese law. Nedir and Mercurren is a journalist in Lebanon who looked at this
*11:03.680- 11:09.600* :  for the national news site and spoke to the BBC's Evan Davis. It is actually so what's called GPS
*11:09.600- 11:16.960* :  jamming. It's a war that's used by a country to disrupt the enemy's attacks. They're relying on GPS
*11:16.960- 11:24.120* :  such as missiles drones are relies on GPS and so basically trick the GPS location into putting
*11:24.120- 11:30.220* :  another location. So Israel has actually admitted to increasing GPS jamming in the region.
*11:30.220- 11:35.780* :  So it's quite baffling when you think that you have two countries that are enemies and it's
*11:35.780- 11:41.620* :  that the citizens are swiping next to each other on dating apps. This is the strange thing. So
*11:41.620- 11:46.640* :  essentially Israel is trying to disguise the position of its troops in the northern part and
*11:46.700- 11:51.480* :  the confusion that they're spreading for their troops hits the dating apps as well.
*11:52.460- 11:58.020* :  Yeah exactly so it hits the dating apps but you can imagine that it's not just the dating apps.
*11:58.020- 12:04.260* :  It's basically any application that uses the user's location. So for instance when I was
*12:04.260- 12:09.240* :  traveling in South Lebanon the GPS was so bad that it would put me in Beirut. It would put me
*12:09.300- 12:15.780* :  in the sea. It would put me in Israel. It has a very weird impact for like just Lebanese especially
*12:15.780- 12:21.080* :  also because for Lebanese it is actually forbidden to have any kind of contacts with Israelis.
*12:21.400- 12:27.220* :  Hang on did you just say that in Lebanon you're not allowed to have contact with Israelis?
*12:27.980- 12:32.940* :  Yeah not even like talk to them so not swiping them so that would be something completely
*12:32.940- 12:37.460* :  forbidden because no Israel and Lebanon are on the brink of the war.
*12:37.580- 12:42.560* :  But as you say Nutter what's absolutely fascinating here is that essentially two countries that are
*12:42.560- 12:49.020* :  on a kind of very fragile tense state with each other. The citizens if they happen to be using
*12:49.020- 12:54.100* :  these apps are getting exposure to the other side. They're seeing the interests, the photos
*12:54.100- 13:00.180* :  of some Israelis Lebanese, the people that they're not really interested in or not meant to be
*13:00.180- 13:06.280* :  interested in. It's extremely lebathling and surprising when you when you find like so many
*13:06.280- 13:12.860* :  Israeli profiles. It has triggered some theories in Lebanon that there might be musad spies trying
*13:12.860- 13:18.040* :  to get information. I also saw people being quite angry at it and saying that they're not
*13:18.040- 13:22.180* :  choosing the apps anymore because there's no use in it. I just wonder whether it does promote a
*13:22.180- 13:26.840* :  bit of understanding. I mean across the border you do basically see that the other people are not
*13:26.840- 13:32.800* :  that different to you. They're just on an app trying to find somebody. I think like some people
*13:32.800- 13:38.620* :  have these very romantic ideas of forbidden love but all of the other I think would be still quite
*13:39.120- 13:44.840* :  annoyed of you know seeing so many profiles that are dimmed as like belonging to the enemy.
*13:50.060- 13:53.460* :  Still to come in this podcast there are fears for the long-eared
*13:53.460- 13:58.760* :  owls of northeast Serbia after the worst mass poisoning of birds ever recorded.
*14:17.680- 14:22.340* :  If you thought the only way to get a more defined jawline with natural looking results was through
*14:22.340- 14:28.400* :  surgery think again. Juvederm Volux XC is a non-surgical injectable gel filler that improves

*16:24.220- 16:29.880* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast. Now to Italy where 97 migrants have been
*16:29.880- 16:33.440* :  airlifted from Libya in an unprecedented evacuation.
*16:39.420- 16:45.900* :  A crowd welcomed the group which includes 55 women and 27 children. Over the next three years
*16:46.440- 16:52.260* :  1500 refugees will be jetting off on the same journey under arrangements brought in by the Italian
*16:52.260- 16:58.080* :  government in December. The UNHCR carried out the evacuation and said those arriving were victims
*16:58.080- 17:03.400* :  of trafficking. People who have survived violence and torture and those with serious health conditions.
*17:03.400- 17:12.940* :  A spokesperson from the agency greeted the rivals. We need many more of these flights. They are
*17:12.940- 17:18.180* :  life-saving. They help people with extreme vulnerabilities to be able to come to our country
*17:18.180- 17:22.580* :  and we are at their side and we're grateful to all those who made it possible.
*17:24.480- 17:27.620* :  But not everyone will share that view. The Prime Minister,
*17:27.620- 17:33.320* :  Georgia Malone, had previously promised Italy would not become Europe's refugee camp.
*17:33.820- 17:38.960* :  So why the gear change? I've been speaking to David A. Gilioni from the BBC's Rome Bureau.
*17:39.640- 17:45.020* :  This is quite significant and I think it surprised the many people because when she wanted to
*17:45.020- 17:50.360* :  be elected when Georgia Malone was campaigning she was very openly against migration
*17:51.580- 17:57.880* :  and she was perceived as anti-immigrant but now very silently I would say this protocol was
*17:57.880- 18:06.140* :  signed with UNHCR and other NGOs on the ground to bring legal migrants into the country.
*18:06.440- 18:12.880* :  Obviously we do know that there's an aging population problem in Italy not only in Italy,
*18:12.880- 18:20.400* :  northern Europe, in other countries, in the UK as well. So there is the need to find solutions
*18:20.400- 18:27.680* :  to bring people in to work and live within the European Union in the UK but that's a very
*18:27.680- 18:33.740* :  very big political issue because obviously this is becoming a huge problem considering the current
*18:33.740- 18:40.280* :  numbers of people trying to cross the Mediterranean or people trying to cross into the UK from France
*18:40.340- 18:48.540* :  crossing the channel. So this is very hard for politicians to tell their base and the voters
*18:48.540- 18:56.420* :  that they're also bringing migrants in a legal way. The group has just arrived. Which countries do
*18:56.420- 19:03.840* :  they come from? So they come from several countries in Africa. Most of them come from Sudan. We
*19:03.840- 19:11.640* :  obviously know that Sudan is a country which has been ravaged by war. There's more since the 15th
*19:11.640- 19:19.180* :  of April there have been more than 8 million displaced there so clearly this is just a drop in the
*19:19.180- 19:27.620* :  ocean but I think it's really significant because this is showing how it's necessary to act urgently
*19:27.620- 19:35.460* :  to find legal pathways for people to apply for asylum elsewhere essentially. What will happen to
*19:35.460- 19:43.520* :  them now now that they're in Italy? So it really depends on the age, on the health, if the
*19:43.520- 19:49.320* :  women, if the children, if they're disabled but there will be a formal process for them to be
*19:49.560- 19:56.000* :  put into the, we call it system allianza in Italian which is basically the system to welcome
*19:56.600- 20:02.940* :  asylum seekers so they'll be part of that and we do know that the aim is to bring more people
*20:02.940- 20:09.300* :  over the coming years. David A. Guilioni. The European Union has reached a provisional
*20:09.300- 20:15.200* :  deal to ban single use plastics by the end of the decade. It still needs final approval from
*20:15.200- 20:21.520* :  the Parliament and from EU member governments. Cyrus and Jura is a member of the European Parliament
*20:21.520- 20:27.760* :  from Malta who's on the EU Parliament's climate committee. He's spoke to Nulam Agavan about the new
*20:27.760- 20:35.440* :  rules. It's not enough but if we do nothing plastic packaging waste was expected to increase by 46
*20:35.440- 20:42.420* :  percent by the year 2030 so something had to be done. As a European Parliament we wanted a more
*20:42.420- 20:48.620* :  ambitious legislation, the European Commission had proposed a more ambitious legislation but member
*20:48.620- 20:53.860* :  states tried to water this down. We managed to get a final agreement between the different
*20:53.980- 21:01.000* :  institutions of the European Union on what law will be agreed to in the end of this quite long
*21:01.000- 21:06.700* :  process actually. And can you tell us concretely what will be banned? Give me an example or examples.
*21:06.700- 21:12.920* :  So one example would be the small shampoo and soap bottles in hotels for instance where rather
*21:12.920- 21:21.060* :  than having small individual shampoo bottles we will go to the not disposable big ones
*21:21.400- 21:27.660* :  where you use the same bottle. If we could speak of other toiletry products in hotels for instance
*21:27.660- 21:34.980* :  lightweight plastic bags in supermarkets or else the you know the small sachets for sauces and
*21:34.980- 21:41.440* :  condiments and restaurants all of those will be banned from that day onwards. There was a lot of
*21:41.440- 21:46.400* :  lobbying apparently incredibly intense around even to get to this compromise that you have at the
*21:46.400- 21:52.600* :  moment and some lobbying groups were saying that it was discriminating against specific packaging
*21:52.600- 21:59.180* :  formats, particularly those that are already able to be recycled and doing that would discourage
*21:59.180- 22:03.980* :  the sustained development of green technologies perhaps even talking about those small packets that
*22:03.980- 22:09.100* :  we can get that are made of paper whether it was for salt or pepper or something along those lines.
*22:09.740- 22:15.660* :  The European Commission for a number of years was moving towards the recycling targets.
*22:15.660- 22:23.520* :  Unfortunately the vast majority of member states including mine, Molta never reached our objectives
*22:23.520- 22:30.220* :  and targets when it came to recycling. It was for those reasons that the European Commission decided
*22:30.220- 22:37.480* :  to move away from recycling targets and instead having more reuse targets and when we speak for
*22:37.480- 22:43.800* :  instance I mentioned shampoo bottles, the small ones in hotels rather than recycling all of those
*22:43.800- 22:49.300* :  small bottles will move towards reusing the same bottle. It's the same thing when comes to
*22:49.300- 22:55.540* :  sugar sachets or sauces sachets and restaurants rather than having the small ones and having
*22:55.540- 23:01.800* :  them made of material that could be recycled. Let's move on to a reusable system where we remember
*23:01.800- 23:06.940* :  the past when I was younger. The system was you would have a big bottle of ketchup and you use that
*23:06.940- 23:13.600* :  and that is reused in the restaurant. Cyrus and Jura from the European Parliament's Climate
*23:13.600- 23:20.020* :  Committee. Scientists have for the first time successfully used stem cells taken from late-stage
*23:20.020- 23:25.980* :  human pregnancy to grow mini organs raising the possibility of treating congenital conditions
*23:25.980- 23:32.280* :  before birth. Researchers in London have developed a safe way to extract stem cells that had passed
*23:32.280- 23:38.200* :  into the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus. Professor Paolo DiCopy is one of the researchers
*23:38.200- 23:45.080* :  involved and told us how the new technology works. We can derive stem cells from the amniotic fluid
*23:45.080- 23:52.480* :  that surround the fetus and these stem cells are able to make mini organ. These are tissue-specific
*23:52.480- 23:58.780* :  stem cells though they are already committed to an organ. We knew the cells coming from the fetus
*23:58.780- 24:05.560* :  were present in the amniotic fluid but we didn't know the stem cell derived specifically from the
*24:05.560- 24:13.800* :  lung, from the intestine and from the kidneys of the fetus. The beauty of this is that we are able to
*24:13.800- 24:23.040* :  extract cells from the fetus without any termination of pregnancy. These cells can replicate some of the
*24:23.040- 24:29.700* :  features of the organ itself and particularly we are referring to the inner layer of the organ,
*24:29.760- 24:35.920* :  so the apithelium. We study one disease that is a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, difficult term
*24:35.920- 24:42.140* :  but essentially is when you're missing the diaphragm which separates the abdomen from the lung.
*24:42.780- 24:50.540* :  In one in 4,000 newborn baby you have this conditioning which the organ of the abdomen come up
*24:50.540- 24:58.720* :  into the chest and press on the developing lung. The lung is hypoplastic so essentially does not
*24:58.720- 25:06.500* :  develop and 30% of these fetus do not survive. So personalised medicine of the fetus if you wish.
*25:07.320- 25:12.120* :  Professor Paolo DiCopy. Authorities in Serbia are investigating what
*25:12.120- 25:17.220* :  all authorities are calling the worst mass poisoning of birds ever recorded in the region.
*25:17.380- 25:22.960* :  The affected area near Kikinder in the northeast of the country is internationally renowned
*25:22.960- 25:29.120* :  for its population of long-eared owls. Our Balkans correspondent, Guadaloni, sent this report.
*25:33.200- 25:39.140* :  Birdwatchers call Kikinder the world capital of long-eared owls. Every winter, hundreds of the
*25:39.140- 25:44.780* :  distinctive, toughty-eared birds of prey roost in the trees around the square of this small
*25:44.780- 25:51.360* :  Serbian town. As well as offering ornithologist Icandy, the owls also provide a valuable service
*25:51.360- 25:57.420* :  to nearby farmers. By some estimates, they devour as many as half a million crop-munching rodents
*25:57.420- 26:03.060* :  over the winter months. But wildlife activists say that's now under threat, following the deaths of
*26:03.060- 26:10.140* :  almost 1,000 birds near Kikinder in recent days. Not owls, but rooks and jackdaws. They're
*26:10.140- 26:15.980* :  locally protected species which are vital to birds of prey, making the nests the owls rely on.
*26:15.980- 26:22.260* :  Milan Ruzic of Serbia's bird protection and study society went to investigate reports of dead birds.
*26:22.260- 26:26.960* :  We could actually see the birds dying right in front of our eyes, because there were standing
*26:26.960- 26:33.160* :  up in the trees, behaving really strange and falling down. The damage is huge. The loss of 800
*26:33.160- 26:38.720* :  qualities in the area is going to hit the population of long-haired owls, common,
*26:38.720- 26:45.020* :  kestrel and wetswitch falcon heavily. Mr Ruzic believes that frustration with crop damage by rodents
*26:45.020- 26:50.840* :  has led someone to spread poisoned seeds as a form of pest control, but the rooks and jackdaws
*26:50.840- 26:55.720* :  took the bait instead. That's still to be confirmed by the authorities who are now analyzing
*26:55.720- 27:01.480* :  the birds to identify the precise cause of death. But without the rook's nests, the long-haired
*27:01.480- 27:06.460* :  owls will have fewer homes and kick in there, and they may simply fly elsewhere next winter.
*27:09.520- 27:15.100* :  That report by Guy Deloni. In the United States, people are now living further and further
*27:15.100- 27:20.660* :  away from the city centre, and you study has revealed that many Americans now live roughly twice
*27:20.660- 27:26.300* :  as far from their offices as they did pre-pandemic. This is according to economists at Stanford
*27:26.300- 27:33.020* :  and Gusto, a payroll provider. Rahul Tandon spoke to Richard Florida, author of the new urban crisis
*27:33.020- 27:37.680* :  and professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto.
*27:38.320- 27:42.540* :  At the beginning of the pandemic, there was a prediction that people would leave big cities
*27:42.620- 27:49.580* :  and move far away to zoom towns, Miami Beach, Austin, Texas, National Tennessee, or Jackson
*27:49.580- 27:55.400* :  Hall, Wyoming, or Boseman, Montana. But what's really happened instead is that the suburban ring,
*27:55.400- 28:01.400* :  or that ex-urban ring outside of cities has gotten larger and larger, and people have kind of jumped
*28:01.400- 28:07.660* :  outside the suburban ring to these kind of rural communities at really the ex-urban fringe.
*28:07.660- 28:12.740* :  So I think that's the big takeaway that America has always been the land of sprawl,
*28:12.740- 28:18.580* :  and remote work has made us sprawlier. There are a lot of people who have moved,
*28:18.580- 28:24.560* :  haven't they, out of state. But why are we seeing more of this phenomenon that you're describing?
*28:24.560- 28:27.640* :  Why aren't they going to Florida? Why aren't they going to the beaches?
*28:28.040- 28:33.000* :  Well, I think because it's really not work from home, it's hybrid work, and I think that's what we've
*28:33.000- 28:38.840* :  seen. It's not that employers are letting people completely off the hook. They want people to come
*28:38.840- 28:44.040* :  in, say, a day a week or more likely two or three days a week, and that's a little bit doable,
*28:44.040- 28:47.840* :  especially if you're committing once a week or once every other week, from the suburban
*28:47.840- 28:53.180* :  fringe, it's a lot harder to do. In fact, what we've been seeing, I think, is that a lot of the
*28:53.180- 28:59.440* :  people who move to different metropolitan areas from New York to Florida, from San Francisco to Austin,
*29:00.120- 29:06.020* :  that once their remote job dries up, it's hard to get another one. So a lot of those folks end
*29:06.020- 29:10.340* :  up going back, if they did finance or real estate to go back to New York, if they did high tech,
*29:10.340- 29:17.240* :  they go back to San Francisco, and there's one additional fact, about 60% of all moves
*29:17.240- 29:24.620* :  during the pandemic were in the same metro, and about 75% of them were in the same county. So
*29:25.420- 29:31.440* :  most people are not moving far, far away. They're moving a little bit further, and in the states,
*29:31.440- 29:36.420* :  we have a moniker we use for this. When you think about people trying to buy a house and housing
*29:36.420- 29:41.560* :  has become, I mean, one thing the pandemic did was drive up the cost of housing or make housing
*29:41.560- 29:46.200* :  more unaffordable because people wanted out of a condo or an apartment, they wanted more space,
*29:46.200- 29:52.340* :  and the phrase is called drive to you qualify. Just think about that drive your car to you qualify
*29:52.340- 29:57.420* :  for a mortgage, because housing costs get a little bit lower the further and further you go from
*29:57.420- 30:01.540* :  the city center, and I think that's really explains at all what Americans are doing, you're driving
*30:01.540- 30:07.980* :  till they qualify for housing. Professor Richard Florida, now if you want to go to a concert in
*30:07.980- 30:14.720* :  Harkiv these days, you have to know who to ask. Ukraine's second city is just 40 kilometers from
*30:14.720- 30:19.660* :  the Russian border, and all mass gatherings have been banned since the start of the full scale
*30:19.660- 30:25.000* :  invasion. Most cultural events that do take place are not advertised to ensure they don't get
*30:25.000- 30:30.560* :  shelved, but after two years of near silence, the Harkiv National Opera and Ballet is about to
*30:30.560- 30:36.600* :  reopen underground. Our Eastern Europe correspondents Sarah Reinsford has been down into the bunker
*30:36.600- 30:45.100* :  beneath the Opera House to find out more. This is the door that's rarely opened these days.
*30:45.940- 30:51.540* :  It's the entrance to the giant auditorium of Harkiv Opera and Ballet Theatre, and it's been empty
*31:00.000- 31:04.860* :  for two years. We followed the sound of music down several flights of stairs into a space with no
*31:04.860- 31:11.780* :  chandeliers or fancy dress circles, just a lot of concrete. It's a theatre beneath the theatre,
*31:12.380- 31:17.120* :  and the cast are preparing to go on with a show with even more passion than before.
*31:22.480- 31:32.020* :  Ike Toulousev is the man in charge. Harkiv is our city. We want there to be life here,
*31:32.800- 31:37.680* :  including a cultural life. Any kind of cultural event here is really in demand.
*31:38.600- 31:43.900* :  People want to feel normal, to feel complete, and we hope we can create that atmosphere
*31:44.540- 31:46.000* :  despite all the security issues.
*31:59.160- 32:04.500* :  The opera they're rehearsing is Ukrainian, Natalka Paltovka, Russian composers have been
*32:04.500- 32:11.260* :  eliminated from the repertoire. More than half the cast are missing though. Some of the men
*32:11.260- 32:17.160* :  are fighting, one has been killed in action, and other artists are scattered as refugees.
*32:18.260- 32:23.860* :  But Julia Forsiukanta has been Vladimir Estilian Harkiv, and they've never stopped singing.
*32:27.500- 32:32.240* :  When the invasion began and the theatre closed, for Vladimir switched to performing on the Metro.
*32:41.060- 32:45.260* :  The shelling was that it's most intense then, and thousands of people were living underground.
*32:48.460- 32:53.400* :  He and Julia traveled to the frontline too, to sing for Ukrainian soldiers.
*32:54.260- 33:00.880* :  We managed to get the soldiers to move a little, and to lift their spirits.
*33:02.000- 33:09.260* :  They even danced a bit with us, and they cried during some sad songs.
*33:15.860- 33:19.500* :  Now, what's left of the company is getting ready for its relaunch.
*33:20.160- 33:24.760* :  The musical scores have been rewritten, so that each instrument takes on multiple roles.
*33:25.600- 33:30.440* :  The Talia is overjoyed at the prospect of performing before a proper audience again,
*33:31.040- 33:32.880* :  as safe as possible underground.
*33:36.360- 33:41.700* :  Every time there is an attack, your heart is torn apart. But what can we do?
*33:43.920- 33:51.380* :  We are all afraid, but we decided to go on living, to do what we can, and to support our people.
*33:52.440- 33:59.700* :  And when we do concerts, it doesn't matter where, then we are showing that lives goes on, despite everything.
*34:11.660- 34:19.760* :  Sarah Reinsford with that report.
*34:22.860- 34:27.860* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
