*00:00.000- 00:03.440* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:05.740- 00:11.800* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Monday, the 25th of March, these are our main stories.
*00:12.420- 00:16.900* :  Russia charges two suspects over the deaths of at least 137 people
*00:17.280- 00:19.320* :  in the attack on a Moscow concert hall.
*00:19.500- 00:24.180* :  It was a big shot because I lived nearby and I saw it from my windows.
*00:24.940- 00:26.600* :  It's horrific.
*00:27.400- 00:32.320* :  Ukraine says it struck two Russian ships and the major communications post for
*00:32.320- 00:38.000* :  Russia's Black Sea Fleet in occupied Crimea and the supreme leader of the Afghan Taliban
*00:38.000- 00:41.400* :  defends stoning and public whipping of women.
*00:44.100- 00:49.320* :  Also in this podcast more than 130 school children abducted earlier this month in
*00:49.320- 00:54.700* :  Kaduna state in Nigeria have been freed and here's a group of animals we've had their
*00:54.700- 00:58.780* :  photographs in our shoe boxes for all these years trying to figure out who they are
*00:59.080- 01:00.580* :  and they've been our mystery animals.
*01:00.580- 01:02.480* :  It's realized there is a pattern here.
*01:02.760- 01:08.220* :  The remarkable discovery of what's thought to be a new population of killer whales in our seas.
*01:11.940- 01:16.840* :  Four men, the Russian authorities claim are suspects in the attack on the concert hall on Friday
*01:16.840- 01:18.560* :  have appeared in court in Moscow.
*01:18.560- 01:22.580* :  State media said two of them had been charged with committing an act of terrorism
*01:22.580- 01:25.900* :  and that one of them from Tajikistan had pleaded guilty.
*01:26.280- 01:30.040* :  137 people were killed in the massacre at Kroka city hall.
*01:30.320- 01:34.840* :  Flags were lowered across Russia on Sunday as muskovites donated blood for the wounded.
*01:35.320- 01:38.140* :  Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow.
*01:38.680- 01:42.200* :  This was a country in mourning and in shock.
*01:42.600- 01:47.800* :  Across Russia flags fluid half mast for the victims of the concert hall massacre.
*01:49.340- 01:54.840* :  And at the scene of Friday's attack, Kroka city hall, the cures grew longer and longer.
*01:55.820- 02:00.060* :  The national day of mourning experienced most acutely here.
*02:00.980- 02:05.520* :  There was an outpouring of sympathy, a mountain of tributes to the dead.
*02:06.680- 02:12.380* :  As well as leaving flowers and candles, people have also been bringing soft toys and sweets
*02:12.380- 02:15.060* :  because amongst the dead there were children.
*02:15.780- 02:17.060* :  There have also been leaving messages.
*02:17.780- 02:21.600* :  One is addressed to the attackers and it reads, you are scum.
*02:22.280- 02:23.260* :  We will never forgive you.
*02:23.920- 02:27.600* :  Among the crowd, there was a mixture of grief and anger.
*02:28.000- 02:33.060* :  It was a big shot because I leave nearby and I saw it from my windows.
*02:34.440- 02:37.360* :  It's horrific and the big tragedy.
*02:40.460- 02:42.460* :  Such a terrible loss says Natalia.
*02:43.000- 02:44.680* :  I'll never forgive or forget.
*02:45.020- 02:50.180* :  Bring back the death penalty, Yvgeny says, for terrorists, for sure.
*02:52.240- 02:53.640* :  This is how the attack had begun.
*02:55.760- 02:59.660* :  With gunmen in the foyer and desperate attempts to take cover.
*03:01.700- 03:04.140* :  The attackers moved on to the auditorium.
*03:04.980- 03:08.100* :  By the end of this, more than 130 people were dead.
*03:10.180- 03:13.020* :  Tonight, the suspected gunmen appeared in court.
*03:17.060- 03:21.620* :  Russia claims they had been caught trying to flee to Ukraine and had contacts there.
*03:22.360- 03:25.200* :  Kyiv fiercely denies any link to the attack.
*03:25.880- 03:29.000* :  The Islamic State group says it was behind the shooting.
*03:30.020- 03:34.840* :  And on this day of morning, silent prayers from a somber looking president Putin.
*03:35.660- 03:40.980* :  The Kremlin says he lit a candle for the victims in church at his country estate.
*03:44.820- 03:47.560* :  And Russia is praying that there will be no more attacks.
*03:48.500- 03:53.620* :  If there are, that will test people's faith in the president to keep them safe.
*03:55.660- 03:57.620* :  Steve Rosenberg reporting from Moscow.
*03:58.080- 04:02.260* :  Meanwhile, Ukraine's armed forces say they've hit two Russian landing ships
*04:02.640- 04:05.060* :  and a communication center in occupied Crimea.
*04:05.540- 04:10.540* :  Early on Sunday, Russia targeted a number of regions across Ukraine with missiles and drones.
*04:11.060- 04:12.940* :  From Kyiv, here's Sarah Reinsford.
*04:16.880- 04:20.600* :  There were powerful explosions in occupied Crimea overnight as Ukraine
*04:20.600- 04:22.660* :  fired dozens of missiles at the peninsula.
*04:24.020- 04:27.400* :  The military here says two Russian landing ships were destroyed,
*04:27.400- 04:30.000* :  as well as a naval communication center.
*04:30.660- 04:35.340* :  That would be a significant blow, though we've seen no images yet to confirm the claim.
*04:36.080- 04:40.060* :  Russian officials do say it was the biggest attack on the port city of Sevastopol
*04:40.060- 04:46.480* :  in recent times. It happened as Russia fired dozens more of its missiles and drones across Ukraine.
*04:46.620- 04:51.740* :  That meant sirens, bombshellters, and explosions for the third night in a row.
*04:52.460- 04:56.060* :  In the Veeve in the West, officials say critical infrastructure was hit.
*04:56.620- 05:00.580* :  And as Russia targeted the city, one missile crossed the Polish border.
*05:01.200- 05:04.300* :  It was flying over NATO territory for 39 seconds.
*05:05.280- 05:09.380* :  The missile was tracked by Polish radars were told and would have been shot down
*05:09.380- 05:14.840* :  had it been heading for a target in Poland. In Warsaw, the foreign ministry said it was demanding
*05:14.840- 05:20.080* :  an explanation. But most of all, it was calling on Moscow to stop what it called Russia's
*05:20.080- 05:24.480* :  terrorist air attacks on Ukraine. Sarah Reinsford in Kyiv.
*05:25.600- 05:29.720* :  When the Taliban in Afghanistan seized power again nearly three years ago,
*05:29.720- 05:32.920* :  they said women had nothing to fear and their rights would be protected.
*05:32.920- 05:37.320* :  But the opposite has happened. Girls can't go to secondary school or university,
*05:37.780- 05:42.020* :  and women abandoned from many places of work and have to abide by strict dress codes.
*05:42.020- 05:48.420* :  Now, in a rare audio message, the supreme leader of the Afghan Taliban has defended the practice
*05:48.420- 05:53.740* :  of stoning women and public lashing. I heard more from our South Asia regional editor
*05:54.040- 05:59.280* :  Ann Barassan at a Russian. He has come out with this audio message where he's talking about
*06:00.000- 06:04.880* :  they will implement the Sharia law at whatever cost. Even though people may criticize,
*06:04.880- 06:10.900* :  it may be against the principles of Western democracy or women's rights. We will continue to
*06:10.900- 06:18.440* :  carry out the public executions and stoning especially for moral offenses and public fluggings will
*06:18.440- 06:24.660* :  be continued under the Taliban regime. He talked about the struggle. They fought for 20 years and
*06:24.660- 06:31.880* :  it is not the end. And we are ready to continue with our quest to implement this Islamic law across
*06:31.880- 06:38.560* :  the country and even beyond. A lot of people will see these kinds of punishments as barbaric.
*06:38.720- 06:44.280* :  Why are these important to him? Because the Taliban always talked about Islamic emirate. They want
*06:44.280- 06:49.840* :  to have an Islamic state where all these Islamic rules are followed and they have always been
*06:49.840- 06:55.120* :  insisting that if we have following Islamic rule, then we implement Sharia law in proper.
*06:55.360- 07:00.520* :  It is rare for him to speak. Why now? We don't exactly why this particular audio was released,
*07:00.540- 07:07.000* :  during this new year of Navros. When the new academic year starts and many people are complaining
*07:07.000- 07:12.660* :  for the third year now, girls are not going to the secondary schools at the same time. They have been
*07:12.660- 07:18.260* :  banned from going to the universities. So there were a lot of comments on social media. Another year
*07:18.260- 07:24.500* :  is coming. Taliban should relax their policies about education of women. So that is probably one of
*07:24.500- 07:29.220* :  the reasons why they are coming out with this statement. Because he obviously knows how this is
*07:29.220- 07:36.320* :  going to be seen in the West. It's a defined message because even though the UN and other Western
*07:36.320- 07:42.040* :  powers have been telling the Taliban, if you need international recognition, then you have to adhere
*07:42.040- 07:47.820* :  to certain rights, like respecting human rights, respecting women's rights. But at the end of the day,
*07:47.820- 07:53.360* :  if you look at the population of Afghanistan, people are suffering. It's an extreme poverty
*07:53.360- 07:58.140* :  unemployment. You don't have any industries previously. It was all coming from international
*07:58.140- 08:03.500* :  funding, particularly from the U.S. In addition to that, more Afghans were being sent back from
*08:03.500- 08:08.260* :  Pakistan and Iran. They are coming back to the country. So the country is in a very, very difficult
*08:08.260- 08:15.740* :  situation. And Barassan et Ahrajan. The Nigerian army says more than 130 school children abducted
*08:15.740- 08:21.300* :  earlier this month in Kaduna State have been freed. A military spokesman says they were rescued in
*08:21.300- 08:26.980* :  the early hours of Sunday morning. But it's not clear if a ransom was paid. Our correspondent in
*08:26.980- 08:33.060* :  Johannesburg Jenny Hill sent this report. The children look exhausted. Their uniforms filthy
*08:33.060- 08:38.940* :  in photos released by the Nigerian authorities. It's more than two weeks since the students aged
*08:38.940- 08:44.800* :  between 8 and 15 were kidnapped from their school. Teachers reported that gunmen on motorbikes
*08:44.800- 08:51.640* :  seized more than 280 children. Officials who claim that all of the children are now free have not
*08:51.640- 08:56.780* :  yet commented on the discrepancy. In previous mass kidnappings, some victims have managed to
*08:56.780- 09:01.320* :  escape from their captors and there can be initial confusion about the number of victims.
*09:02.160- 09:07.480* :  It's also unclear how the children were freed. The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of nearly
*09:07.480- 09:14.180* :  700,000 U.S. dollars. The governor of Kaduna State, Ubersani, said their release was due to
*09:14.180- 09:19.660* :  the courage of the Nigerian security forces. He also thanked the Nigerian president for his help.
*09:19.660- 09:26.840* :  This was he added, a day of joy. Jenny Hill. Scientists in Canada believe to have discovered
*09:26.840- 09:32.800* :  a new population of orcas. The massive mammals, also properly known as the killer whale,
*09:32.800- 09:38.780* :  are the ocean's top predator. Researchers at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver say
*09:38.780- 09:45.200* :  a group of 49 mystery whales off the west coast of California do not match any other known
*09:45.200- 09:51.400* :  types of orcas. Their research draws on 25 years of whale sightings. Andrew Tritese is a professor
*09:51.400- 09:57.260* :  and director of the marine mammal research unit at the University of British Columbia. He told
*09:57.260- 10:03.160* :  Julian Warwick a more about what made these whales so unique. From a photograph of a killer whale,
*10:03.180- 10:07.980* :  it's like a fingerprint. Each dorsal fin has unique shape. Sometimes they have nicks and scars on
*10:07.980- 10:12.200* :  them. In behind, on top of the killer whale, they have what we call a saddle patch. It's sort of a
*10:12.200- 10:18.420* :  grayish area. That has a unique shape as well. And so it's possible then to know each killer whale
*10:18.420- 10:23.220* :  individually just from a single photograph. Over the years, it's been possible to put together
*10:23.220- 10:28.840* :  such they family albums or family trees where we can relate individuals to each other as well as
*10:28.840- 10:33.660* :  to those that they've associated with. On the west coast of North America, we have three
*10:33.660- 10:38.560* :  equitipes of killer whales. One, they specialize in eating only marine mammals. One, they specialize
*10:38.560- 10:44.000* :  in eating only fish and another one that specializes in eating sharks and large fish. And so we
*10:44.000- 10:48.940* :  have these populations. They've now been fairly well studied. We've got 49 animals and their pictures
*10:48.940- 10:55.100* :  don't match with any of the other known individuals. And what do these 49 eat? We've seen them eating
*10:55.100- 11:00.680* :  on a marine mammal. So that tells us that they're related to the marine mammal eco type. But we've
*11:00.680- 11:04.400* :  also seen them eating a sea turtle, which is a little bit different. But I think one of the other
*11:04.400- 11:09.060* :  things that really stood out to us with this group, compared to all the others, is that on their
*11:09.100- 11:14.220* :  bodies, they're missing chunks of flesh. They're small chunks, but these are caused by cookie cutter
*11:14.220- 11:20.120* :  sharks. They're not there to kill the whale, but simply to get a free meal. And of these animals,
*11:20.120- 11:25.800* :  46 of the 49 had cookie cutter shark marks. And these bite marks are coming from a species that
*11:25.800- 11:30.840* :  lives in more tropical waters. So what tells us that while we've seen this population north,
*11:30.840- 11:36.400* :  it's likely spending a lot of time in more tropical waters as well. Is it also right that they
*11:36.400- 11:43.340* :  have preyed on sperm whales on some occasions? Yes, that is one of the species that we're seeing
*11:43.340- 11:48.200* :  being attacked. And the sperm whales are quite interesting. In this case, there's a group of 12
*11:48.200- 11:53.700* :  killer whales attacking nine adult female sperm whales. And the sperm whales, when they're under
*11:53.700- 11:58.940* :  attack, they form a rosetta whereby they put their heads in the center and their tails out to
*11:58.940- 12:02.920* :  lash out at what's attacking them. In this case, the killer whales. And the killer whales will
*12:02.920- 12:07.740* :  just be relentless and ultimately did kill one of the individuals. But sperm whales are enormous.
*12:08.240- 12:12.080* :  They are enormous. And that's one of the things about this group is they're feeding
*12:12.080- 12:17.420* :  in the open ocean and they're feeding in a location so far from shore. And in order to
*12:17.760- 12:22.420* :  corner the prey out there, they can't rely on pushing it to the bottom or into the here shore.
*12:22.760- 12:26.860* :  They have to work together to both corner the animal, prevent it from diving, deeper and a
*12:26.860- 12:30.860* :  sperm whale can of course dive much deeper than what a killer whale can. But working together,
*12:30.860- 12:35.920* :  they're able to make a living there and capture and take down very large animals such as
*12:35.920- 12:40.460* :  sperm whales. And we do our best to observe what's going on. And every now and then we see something
*12:40.460- 12:45.300* :  that doesn't quite fit. And here's a group of animals. We've had their photographs in our
*12:45.300- 12:49.800* :  shoe boxes for all these years trying to figure out who they are. And they've been our mystery
*12:49.800- 12:55.940* :  animals to realize there is a pattern here. And after 25 years, we think this is a new population
*12:56.080- 13:01.180* :  unknown to science. And we believe they should be referred to as the oceanic population of
*13:01.180- 13:07.000* :  killer whales. So you know about 49, but presumably there may be more, there may be many more.
*13:07.260- 13:12.740* :  You're exactly right. And the process of discovering new animals, we can start to plot up the new ones
*13:12.740- 13:17.160* :  we've seen as well as the repeat sightings. And we call that a discovery curve. We're still in
*13:17.160- 13:21.560* :  a very steep portion. It's rising. We don't know where it's going to top out at. It's at 100,
*13:21.560- 13:26.880* :  200, maybe 300. What is interesting is that while this paper has just come out, it's actually
*13:26.880- 13:31.260* :  getting people to look through some of their photographs. And it does appear in fact that there's
*13:31.260- 13:36.760* :  some other unknown individuals that likely do belong to this population. Andrew Triti is speaking
*13:36.760- 13:47.480* :  to Julian Warica. Still to come in the Global News Podcast. Celebrating 60 years of music with
*13:47.480- 14:03.060* :  the Colombian legend, Franco. Counting is underway in Senegal following the controversial
*14:03.120- 14:08.500* :  delayed presidential election. The vote in the West African state took place after weeks of
*14:08.500- 14:13.500* :  political unrest following the outgoing president, Maggie Sal's attempt to delay the election.
*14:13.900- 14:18.640* :  The constitution barred him from running for a third term. But he endorsed the former Prime Minister
*14:18.640- 14:25.160* :  Amidou Bar who said the day had passed peacefully. The message we're sending out is one of peace.
*14:26.340- 14:33.240* :  Senegal belongs to us. We're all children of this country. We competed. The electoral campaign went
*14:33.240- 14:40.860* :  well, even if it was short, but it was calm. There was no violence. In what many see as a crucial
*14:40.860- 14:45.520* :  test for a country that was until recently seen as a beacon of democracy in the region,
*14:45.520- 14:50.760* :  Mr Sal said that no one should claim victory before the results are announced. And another
*14:50.760- 14:56.460* :  leading candidate, Basirou Jomi Fai, urged people to accept the outcome whoever wins.
*14:56.980- 15:00.160* :  My colleague James Cottonall told me more about how the day went.
*15:00.700- 15:06.340* :  I've been around several polling stations in the capital Dakar. In every case, people were voting.
*15:06.340- 15:11.380* :  There were no logistical problems. I didn't meet one woman who said she couldn't find her name
*15:11.380- 15:15.540* :  on the list that there had been a problem. And there's some indications that that happened to in
*15:15.540- 15:20.740* :  another place on the outskirts of Dakar. But broadly speaking, and confirming this too with a
*15:20.740- 15:25.680* :  couple of observers, I've spoken to in different places, including the head of the regional body,
*15:25.680- 15:31.980* :  Ecoasis observation mission. They say that it has been a peaceful, calm and largely orderly vote.
*15:32.260- 15:37.440* :  And this comes after weeks of unrest following President Sal's attempt to delay the election.
*15:37.760- 15:43.140* :  Yeah, truly an astonishing moment in Senegal's history. A president who had it seemed to many
*15:43.140- 15:48.720* :  flirted with the idea of an unconstitutional third term. Then suddenly in February announced that,
*15:48.720- 15:51.880* :  oh, these polls are a couple of weeks, we're not going to have them. I want to push them back
*15:52.320- 15:56.880* :  to December. There was such an outcry at that domestic and international pressure.
*15:57.340- 16:02.460* :  Constitutional court ruling, ultimately saying, no, no, you can't delay for that period of time.
*16:02.960- 16:08.620* :  But that led many to question to what extent Senegal truly was, this bastion of democracy.
*16:08.780- 16:14.440* :  But look, the polls have taken place. The votes are month or so late, but they have taken place
*16:14.440- 16:19.300* :  before the end of President Mackie Sal's mandate. We're at the counting phase now. We wait to see
*16:19.300- 16:24.600* :  how people react to the results. But you can certainly make the case that democracy seems back on track.
*16:24.940- 16:28.840* :  So 19 candidates, who were the most prominent? I think without a doubt,
*16:28.840- 16:34.200* :  Bachelorette Jommai Faye, who you've already mentioned, an opposition leader, he's the protege
*16:34.200- 16:40.000* :  really of Usman Sankar, even more popular opposition figure, isn't allowed to run because of
*16:40.320- 16:44.460* :  a court judgment against him that he and his supporters see as politically motivated.
*16:44.460- 16:50.460* :  But Bachelorette Jommai Faye, Sankar's candidate, is seen as the voice of change, if you like.
*16:51.060- 16:55.900* :  And the main figure against him is Amadubar, who we heard a clip of earlier, the form of Prime Minister.
*16:55.900- 17:01.120* :  He's the establishment candidate. Plenty of other candidates too. People close perhaps to those
*17:01.120- 17:06.640* :  in power, several opposition figures too. The question I suppose is, will anyone be able to get
*17:06.640- 17:12.560* :  a majority in the first round, or as perhaps seems more likely, are we heading for a second round,
*17:12.560- 17:17.160* :  given the number of candidates? So when do we get the results? We're expecting it sometime in the
*17:17.160- 17:20.760* :  next two, three days, has to be by the end of the week. I suspect it'll be before that.
*17:21.140- 17:24.520* :  In the next few hours, we might have some indication of the direction it's going,
*17:24.520- 17:30.980* :  but I wouldn't expect a result straight away. James Cobbner. Israeli forces have been continuing
*17:30.980- 17:36.340* :  their ground and air attacks in many parts of Gaza, despite persistent calls for a ceasefire.
*17:36.680- 17:41.940* :  They've been targeting, in particular, the Schiffer hospital, where they say Hamas fighters are hiding.
*17:42.540- 17:46.720* :  Meanwhile, the Palestinian population is suffering from hunger and malnutrition.
*17:46.720- 17:53.180* :  The head of the UN's aid agency UNRA says Israel is preventing its food convoys from entering
*17:53.180- 17:59.740* :  the north of Gaza. Speaking in Egypt, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said a humanitarian
*17:59.740- 18:06.220* :  ceasefire was imperative. The current orders in Gaza serve no one, and they're having an impact
*18:06.220- 18:13.920* :  around the globe. The daily assault on the human dignity of Palestinians is creating a crisis
*18:13.920- 18:20.080* :  of credibility for the international community. It is challenging the values we proclaim as universal.
*18:21.000- 18:27.140* :  It is challenging international law. It is challenging core humanitarian principles. It is
*18:27.140- 18:33.680* :  challenging our basic humanity. I'm at least correspondent Yolanda Nell is following developments
*18:33.680- 18:40.480* :  from Jerusalem. The Israeli military says that it's hit 65 targets in the Gaza Strip in the past
*18:40.480- 18:47.360* :  24 hours. Still, the main focus of its operations there remains the Schiffer hospital in Gaza City.
*18:47.360- 18:53.620* :  Its troops returned there for a major raid last Monday, and we're hearing from the Israeli
*18:53.620- 18:58.400* :  military that now something like 800 people have been arrested in that area, and it says that
*18:58.400- 19:04.660* :  something like 480 members of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad are among those who've been arrested,
*19:04.660- 19:10.220* :  also 170 people it's calling terrorists have been killed. It's very difficult to contact
*19:10.220- 19:16.020* :  Palestinians in that area. Communications are poor, but Palestinians there, including displaced
*19:16.020- 19:21.080* :  people, medics and patients. Well, we've been hearing from some of them that conditions are
*19:21.080- 19:25.420* :  desperate. It's very hard for them to get access to any medicine and food, and the innocent people
*19:25.420- 19:30.260* :  are among those who've been killed. Five patients are said to have died. Meanwhile,
*19:30.260- 19:35.620* :  Palestinian medics are saying that there is also fighting very close to two hospitals in the south
*19:35.620- 19:41.180* :  of the Gaza Strip, and it's still not clear exactly what happened a day ago when Hamas officials
*19:41.180- 19:48.080* :  in Gaza say that Israeli forces killed 19 people and wounded 20 more as they were waiting for an
*19:48.080- 19:53.400* :  aid convoy to arrive in Gaza City. The Israeli military has denied that its forces opened fire
*19:53.400- 19:58.560* :  and say that they're still investigating exactly what happened there. Meanwhile,
*19:58.560- 20:04.480* :  those talks still going on in Qatar, indirect talks between Israel and Hamas on a new ceasefire
*20:04.480- 20:10.380* :  and hostage release deal, but we've got the members of the US delegation, the CIA director,
*20:10.380- 20:16.920* :  and also the head of the Israeli delegation, the head of the Mossad spy agency, leaving the talks
*20:16.920- 20:21.580* :  for the moment. A Palestinian official close to them telling journalists that big gaps
*20:21.580- 20:28.300* :  remain between the two sides. The Philippines is one of the countries in the world most at
*20:28.300- 20:33.320* :  risk from the effects of climate change with typhoons and droughts becoming more common and more
*20:33.320- 20:39.580* :  severe. At the same time, it has some of the most expensive energy in Southeast Asia. BBC
*20:39.580- 20:45.300* :  What in the world's Hannah Gilbert has been too manila to find out if solar power could be the
*20:45.300- 20:52.820* :  answer to the Philippines' energy problems. I'm on the top story of a car park in the middle of
*20:52.820- 20:58.380* :  Manila. The mall below me is blasting out air conditioning, but up here in the sand it is
*20:58.380- 21:05.740* :  the middle of the day and it's baking hot and above me are row upon row of solar panels. They are
*21:05.740- 21:11.080* :  helping to generate energy that goes back into the grid to help power buildings like the mall below.
*21:12.060- 21:17.180* :  Now, solar is one type of renewable energy that lots of countries are embracing as they try to
*21:17.180- 21:22.900* :  reduce the effect of climate change. It's particularly appealing here as the Philippines relies heavily
*21:22.900- 21:28.000* :  on imported coal and it has some of the most expensive energy in all of Southeast Asia.
*21:29.880- 21:34.660* :  Talking to people out and about in Manila, we heard how worried they are about the climate and
*21:34.680- 21:38.760* :  energy. If I say climate change, what is the first thing you think of?
*21:39.480- 21:45.460* :  More difficulty in sustaining life. We know exactly what will happen to all of us if we cannot
*21:45.860- 21:51.780* :  reverse that climate change. It's a tropical country so I do believe that having too much sun
*21:51.780- 21:58.320* :  or having too much heat can really affect people. Although too much sun can be harmful,
*21:58.320- 22:03.200* :  solar energy is a valuable resource and it's one of the main alternatives to fossil fuels.
*22:03.840- 22:08.900* :  I spoke to Gisette Enano, a local journalist and Joshua Miguel Lopez, an energy engineer
*22:09.220- 22:13.660* :  about why electricity costs so much. I think the primary reasons why it's so expensive,
*22:13.660- 22:19.080* :  it's because of the transmission costs. The way that the systems are set up and the Philippines is
*22:19.080- 22:25.180* :  that the way we get our power is so centralized and coal in the Philippines most of it is imported
*22:25.180- 22:32.140* :  from other countries and so we are heavily reliant on the world market. Is there already some
*22:32.140- 22:37.520* :  renewable energy in the market? How much energy is being generated by solo or other forms of
*22:37.520- 22:46.060* :  other sources? So as of 2022, the renewable energy is already 32.2 percent of the electricity
*22:46.060- 22:51.280* :  generation of the Philippines. Most of it comes from geothermal and hydro because we have a lot of
*22:51.280- 22:55.920* :  volcanoes in the Philippines. Solar and wind, even though there were projects since the renewable
*22:55.920- 23:01.180* :  energy act was passed, there is still little development for solar and wind. I think it's not a
*23:01.180- 23:07.380* :  matter of choosing this renewable energy over that. It's a matter of actually looking at all the
*23:07.380- 23:12.580* :  sources that is available to us in diversifying. One of the main critiques about renewable energies
*23:12.580- 23:18.660* :  that it's intermittent, but if you diversify it, the fluctuations would eventually balance out.
*23:19.200- 23:23.200* :  Based on the potential of rooftop solar in one of the reasons that is very climate analytics,
*23:23.880- 23:29.840* :  rooftop solar alone could already supply the electricity needs back in 2022.
*23:30.540- 23:35.660* :  But a transition to renewable energy has to be done in the right way. This is Mitsijen El Tan,
*23:35.660- 23:40.200* :  a local climate activist. Something that's already happening today where a lot of solar farms
*23:40.200- 23:45.880* :  are displacing farmers who do not own their own land. A lot of hydro dams are displacing
*23:45.880- 23:51.720* :  indigenous communities and causing floods to nearby communities and you have these projects that
*23:51.720- 23:57.480* :  aren't actually consulted with the communities, consulted with experts on how to address the energy
*23:57.480- 24:03.280* :  issue. And that's a thing. I think our energy people are still considering the energy crisis separate
*24:03.280- 24:07.680* :  from the climate and biodiversity crisis, not realizing that we need to tackle all of them together,
*24:07.680- 24:12.700* :  because if we have the renewable energy, but it destroys biodiversity in the process,
*24:13.100- 24:17.420* :  that makes us more vulnerable to climate impacts, which makes electricity more difficult for us to
*24:17.420- 24:21.180* :  have and it just becomes a loop. So we really need to have a holistic approach when approaching this.
*24:22.660- 24:27.420* :  I'm back here on the roof of the car park in the shade of some of these huge solar panels
*24:27.420- 24:32.620* :  above me and it was so interesting to hear about how solar could be part of a much needed
*24:32.620- 24:37.340* :  move towards renewable energy. Feeling the heat here, it is easy to imagine why.
*24:38.400- 24:43.480* :  Anna Gelbert and if you want to hear the full episode search for BBC What in the World,
*24:43.500- 24:49.860* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts. Conservationists say they've rescued 18
*24:49.860- 24:56.020* :  orphaned bear cubs in Laos in the past week. 16 were found inside a private home after a tip off
*24:56.100- 25:01.740* :  from a neighbour. The other two were confiscated from a farm. Asiatic black bears are trafficked,
*25:01.740- 25:07.040* :  but kept as pets in the region or farmed to produce an ingredient in traditional medicine.
*25:07.040- 25:13.180* :  Asia Pacific Editor Celia Hatton reports. On social media, the orphaned bears are
*25:13.180- 25:19.200* :  shown clambering out of travel crates, as animal workers wait with bottles of milk nearby.
*25:20.140- 25:25.080* :  16 cubs were found inside a house in the capital of Vientien several days ago,
*25:25.480- 25:31.520* :  marking the biggest ever rescue in Laos. Rescueers say it's possible the bear's mothers were
*25:31.520- 25:37.920* :  trafficked or perhaps killed in efforts to extract bile from their gallbladders for use in
*25:37.920- 25:43.160* :  traditional medicine. Wildlife officials have been trying to end the trade in the bile of
*25:43.160- 25:50.840* :  Asiatic black bears, also known as moon bears. Bile farming is painful and often fatal for bears.
*25:53.400- 25:58.980* :  Fruco is one of Colombia and Latin America's biggest music stars. This year he's marking
*25:58.980- 26:05.720* :  six decades of playing everything from salsa to psychedelia and Latin jazz. A native of the
*26:05.720- 26:11.340* :  city of Medellin, Fruco has used his music to try to bring joy to a country that's experienced
*26:11.340- 26:17.240* :  decades of violent conflict. Ahead of his performance at London's Latin Music Festival La
*26:17.240- 26:24.040* :  Linia next month, Martin Venard asked Fruco about his start in professional music at the tender
*26:24.040- 26:25.360* :  age of 13.
*26:35.020- 26:45.940* :  Thanks to God, I managed to join what at the time was Colombia's most famous group,
*26:45.940- 26:51.040* :  Los Corraleros de Mahaguá. They played music from the North Coast of Colombia. It's very
*26:51.040- 26:57.200* :  joyful music, which produced some very big hits. At that time I played that timbal, which is a
*26:57.200- 27:08.120* :  kind of drum, so I was the drummer that timbal player in Los Corraleros de Mahaguá. You recorded
*27:08.120- 27:16.860* :  some famous salsa songs such as El Preso, The Prisoner. Tell us about that. That song was composed
*27:16.860- 27:24.940* :  by Álvaro Elasquez. In 1975, it was recorded by my group, Fruco y Sustesos. It is a prayer to God
*27:24.940- 27:30.960* :  by The Prisoner to get him out of prison. The song was based on a letter written by a prisoner
*27:30.960- 27:37.020* :  in Toronto, Canada, who was doing 30 years for drug trafficking. It was sent to the composer,
*27:37.520- 27:42.780* :  who decided to write the words and it was up to me to sing them, which was a very beautiful and
*27:51.000- 27:59.700* :  unforgettable experience. You're from Medellín, where the drugs cartel leader Pablo Escobar
*27:59.700- 28:08.640* :  was from. What legacy has he left in your city? I want to tell you that my path in life
*28:08.640- 28:14.220* :  has been very different to his, and he was not someone I knew. But in the city of Medellín,
*28:14.240- 28:19.160* :  there are sometimes tours that come to see where his story started, but we don't want to promote
*28:19.160- 28:33.800* :  crimes that cause sadness, pain and poverty for some, but riches for others. You stood for the
*28:33.800- 28:39.720* :  Senate for the party of the then president Juan Manuel Santos. What did you hope to achieve?
*28:43.200- 28:48.000* :  Firstly, I wanted to highlight the work of musicians, because our country has a system
*28:48.360- 28:53.020* :  which is not well set up to allow artists to emerge and to pay them their royalties.
*28:53.760- 28:58.920* :  And so my plan was not only to represent musicians and obtain guarantees for them,
*28:59.320- 29:03.060* :  but also to open doors in the Senate to think such a tourism with music,
*29:03.640- 29:09.080* :  so that tourists could feel happy to come and enjoy our music, which is among the most joyful in
*29:18.760- 29:24.420* :  the world. Colombia has suffered from decades of conflict with armed groups and drug cartels and
*29:24.420- 29:32.400* :  kidnappings. Can a musician help bring people together? Yes, that is our job because our country has
*29:32.400- 29:38.640* :  lots of problems due to political polarization. But we are dedicated to living happily in a country
*29:38.640- 29:45.260* :  that has lots of beautiful places and a wonderful climate. So I feel very happy to be able to do that.
*29:45.560- 29:52.080* :  I am 73 years old. This year I'm marking 60 years in music and I feel very happy about it.
*30:03.840- 30:08.040* :  The Colombian Legend Fruco speaking to Martin Venard.
*30:10.680- 30:16.020* :  And that's all from us now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast.
*30:16.020- 30:20.340* :  Later, if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
*30:20.900- 30:27.980* :  you can send us an email. The address is globalpodcast.bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on
*30:27.980- 30:35.120* :  X at Global NewsPod. This edition was mixed by Craig Kingham and the producer was Emma Joseph.
*30:35.540- 30:40.580* :  The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Alex Ritson. Until next time, goodbye.
