*01:48.440- 01:54.100* :  The US says the vote was neither free nor fair. Israel says it will not leave Palestinians,
*01:54.100- 01:58.780* :  civilians trapped in Rafa during its planned military offensive in the city. And
*01:59.520- 02:05.080* :  the most difficult thing that made me desperate to escape was the boss forcing me to have sex with him.
*02:06.060- 02:11.680* :  He threatened me and said if I shouted he would shoot me. A special report on the horrific
*02:11.680- 02:19.900* :  treatment of African domestic servants in Oman. Also in the podcast, Swiss police block
*02:19.900- 02:23.940* :  a speech by an Austrian far-right politician. And...
*02:24.060- 02:27.240* :  ...come up and say you need to make a dismount.
*02:31.060- 02:34.420* :  Singer Steve Harley has died at the age of 73.
*02:39.180- 02:43.320* :  Despite a quiet show of defiance from some opposition supporters,
*02:43.320- 02:49.060* :  Vladimir Putin has been re-elected as president of Russia with a record share of the vote,
*02:49.060- 02:55.360* :  at least according to the Kremlin. It puts him on course to overtake Joseph Stalin's 29 years
*02:55.360- 03:00.780* :  in power in the Soviet Union. The US, Britain, Germany and others have pointed out that the
*03:00.780- 03:06.240* :  poll was neither free nor fair. But that didn't stop Mr Putin giving a triumphant television
*03:06.240- 03:12.080* :  address. So we'd like to thank first of all citizens of Russia. We are all one team
*03:13.240- 03:16.940* :  who have come to the polling stations today and voted.
*03:18.880- 03:26.580* :  And of course today, in the conditions we live in, I want to give special thanks to our soldiers,
*03:26.580- 03:34.860* :  the people who are fighting along the contact line and providing for the country's existence.
*03:37.360- 03:42.660* :  Mr Putin said Russia was advancing in Ukraine, but the army needed to be made stronger.
*03:42.660- 03:48.700* :  With control of the media and his opponents dead or in jail, his election victory was never
*03:48.700- 03:54.140* :  endowed. But in such a controlled society, why go to so much trouble to give the illusion of
*03:54.140- 04:01.380* :  democracy? A question for Vitaly Chevchenko from BBC Monitoring. It's a ritual of legitimizing
*04:01.380- 04:08.940* :  Vladimir Putin's continued rule. And with 30% of the votes counted, the authorities are saying
*04:08.940- 04:15.700* :  that Vladimir Putin received 88% of the vote, which is an incredibly high figure. It's the highest
*04:15.700- 04:23.380* :  ever percentage that Vladimir Putin received in an election. He started with 52 back in the year
*04:23.380- 04:29.040* :  2000. Now he's got 88. And this is the kind of result you get in a dictatorship really where
*04:29.040- 04:34.500* :  political opponents get fined, jailed, or just die where there's no free speech or free media,
*04:35.320- 04:39.400* :  few independent observers, and the electoral authorities are controlled by the government. And
*04:39.400- 04:46.840* :  all this is what we see in Russia. Yeah, I mean the US says it's obviously not free or fair
*04:46.840- 04:51.780* :  the election. I mean, does it make any difference to Vladimir Putin's rule in Russia?
*04:52.160- 04:57.820* :  Well, some people say that he will feel emboldened and more empowered as if he needs that,
*04:57.820- 05:04.900* :  because even before this election, he had everything under control. But the fact is, few
*05:05.020- 05:12.420* :  autocratic leaders like to be called autocrats, they prefer to show to people at home in a broad
*05:12.480- 05:18.900* :  that, look, my people are voting for me, they want me to stay. And this is one big reason why
*05:18.940- 05:24.340* :  this quote-unquote election was held. Now we're hearing reports that an election commission
*05:24.380- 05:30.960* :  was killed in the Russian-controlled town of Burdyansk and occupied Ukraine. What might change
*05:30.960- 05:37.020* :  now in Ukraine following this election? I think few things are going to change either in Russia
*05:37.020- 05:42.760* :  or in occupied parts of Ukraine. Of course, with this election exercise out of the way,
*05:42.760- 05:49.800* :  it would be easier for Vladimir Putin to take unpopular steps, such as possibly declaring
*05:49.800- 05:57.740* :  another mobilization of forces to Ukraine or raise taxes. But the truth is, he was in charge
*05:57.740- 06:02.920* :  before this election was held, and he's going to be in charge tomorrow. In fact,
*06:02.920- 06:07.060* :  there are preparations already in Moscow for a concert to be held in the Red Square,
*06:07.060- 06:14.220* :  which seems to be a way of giving Vladimir Putin an opportunity to accept his victory.
*06:14.860- 06:21.020* :  Vitaly Shepchenko, Russia editor of BBC Monitoring. Well, although the protests in Russia itself
*06:21.020- 06:26.720* :  were low-key, there was more open defiance from expatriate Russians in Europe and the US.
*06:27.560- 06:31.360* :  In the Czech-Cavital Prague demonstrators burned an effigy of Vladimir Putin.
*06:31.720- 06:35.720* :  At the Russian Embassy in Berlin, a crowd cheered Yulia Navalnya,
*06:36.120- 06:40.680* :  widow of the dead opposition leader Alexei Navalny, when she turned up to cast her vote.
*06:41.320- 06:45.800* :  Several dozen protesters also gathered outside the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC.
*06:45.800- 06:49.880* :  Our correspondent there will Vernon talk me more about the reaction in the US.
*06:50.360- 06:55.020* :  We've just had, not long ago, a very brief statement from the White House after the initial
*06:55.020- 07:00.500* :  results in inverted commas were released. They said the elections are obviously not free nor fair,
*07:00.900- 07:05.780* :  given how Mr. Putin has imprisoned political opponents and prevented others from running against him.
*07:06.240- 07:09.740* :  And that really echoes what many people were telling me down at the Russian Embassy here in
*07:09.740- 07:15.300* :  Washington earlier. Several hundred people had gathered to cast their votes, but also many of
*07:15.300- 07:20.360* :  them to hold a protest against Vladimir Putin. And in that queue was Lubov's Sorbul. She
*07:20.360- 07:25.780* :  is one of Alexei Navalny's closest aides, worked with him very closely for many years.
*07:25.780- 07:31.560* :  She called on Western nations not to recognize the result of these so-called elections,
*07:31.600- 07:35.960* :  and not to recognize Vladimir Putin as the legitimate president of Russia.
*07:36.280- 07:42.580* :  Let's look at the impact of all of this on Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has vowed to press on
*07:42.620- 07:48.020* :  with his military operation there. There are reports that the Ukrainians are running out of
*07:48.020- 07:54.500* :  air defense missiles and could be all out of them by the end of the month. Is the US any closer to
*07:54.500- 08:00.760* :  agreeing that new funding package for Ukraine? No, it's not $60 billion of desperately needed
*08:01.120- 08:07.080* :  for Ukraine. It's stuck in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers seem not keen at all to pass that
*08:07.080- 08:12.100* :  piece of legislation. There's a huge row about this bill here. President Biden has called
*08:12.100- 08:17.040* :  repeatedly for that aid to be granted. He says history is watching. It was the first thing he
*08:17.040- 08:23.160* :  talked about during his big state of the Union speech earlier this month. And Ukraine, Russia,
*08:23.160- 08:28.280* :  Putin, these are major election issues here. Donald Trump, of course, often speaks very
*08:28.280- 08:33.980* :  warmly of Vladimir Putin. He is skeptical about helping Ukraine. Joe Biden is a firm backer
*08:34.320- 08:40.060* :  of Kiev. He has called Vladimir Putin a killer. He's called him a war criminal. So you've got
*08:40.060- 08:44.960* :  two candidates for the presidential election here in the United States with two very different
*08:44.960- 08:50.480* :  approaches to Russia. So I think, you know, in his calendar hanging on the wall in the Kremlin,
*08:50.480- 08:57.200* :  after today, the next big red circle Mr. Putin's drawn is on the 5th of November. And that's the US
*08:57.200- 09:04.100* :  presidential election. Well, Vernon in Washington. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
*09:04.100- 09:09.540* :  given a defiant response to international criticism of Israel's military operation in Gaza.
*09:09.800- 09:15.400* :  He vowed to go ahead with the planned offensive in Rafa, where most of the Gaza population has fled
*09:15.400- 09:20.420* :  to escape fighting elsewhere. However, at a joint news conference with the German Chancellor
*09:20.460- 09:26.220* :  Schultz, who's visiting Jerusalem, he did say Israel wouldn't leave civilians trapped in Rafa.
*09:26.900- 09:34.160* :  I assured Chancellor Schultz that our goal in eliminating the remaining terrorist battalions in
*09:34.160- 09:40.200* :  Rafa goes hand in hand with enabling to be civilian population to leave Rafa. It's not
*09:40.200- 09:46.120* :  something that we will do while keeping the population locked in place. We'll enable them to
*09:46.120- 09:52.640* :  leave because our consideration for reducing and minimizing civilian casualties has guided us and
*09:52.640- 09:57.320* :  will continue to guide us in the future. For his part, Mr. Schultz called for more aid to be
*09:57.320- 10:01.940* :  allowed into the Palestinian territory. I also spoke to the Prime Minister today about the need
*10:01.940- 10:08.660* :  to provide the people in Gaza with comprehensive humanitarian aid supplies. We cannot stand by and
*10:08.660- 10:14.700* :  watch Palestinians risk starvation. Much more humanitarian aid is needed continuously reliably.
*10:15.460- 10:21.140* :  The two men also seem to have differing views on a possible hostage deal with new negotiations
*10:21.140- 10:28.000* :  due to resume in Qatar. Mr Schultz called for a longer lasting ceasefire, but Mr. Netanyahu said
*10:28.000- 10:32.880* :  Israel wouldn't accept an agreement that left it weak. So what are we to make of the Israeli
*10:32.880- 10:38.900* :  leaders rhetoric? I spoke to our correspondent in Jerusalem Mark Loen. I think it's pretty classic
*10:38.900- 10:45.300* :  Netanyahu. This is a leader who is under huge criticism here in Israel from some members of his own
*10:45.300- 10:50.640* :  cabinet and of course from his Western allies who are growing increasingly exasperated who are
*10:50.640- 10:54.720* :  running out of patience with him. We have the U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer
*10:54.720- 10:59.900* :  basically calling for his replacement a couple of days ago and being backed by Joe Biden
*10:59.900- 11:05.860* :  in that call. And he has dug in, which is very typical of him, he's saying that they have short
*11:05.860- 11:10.080* :  memories of the 7th of October attacks and that they have in his words lost their moral conscience.
*11:10.780- 11:17.020* :  He is very defined over Israel's plans to enter Raffa aware about an estimated 1.4 million
*11:17.020- 11:21.820* :  people are sheltering in more than half the population of Gaza and he is determined to push on
*11:21.820- 11:27.120* :  with what he calls total victory. The other interpretation of his word is that he's trying to
*11:27.120- 11:32.780* :  up the pressure on Hamas ahead of these new ceasefire talks in Doha to which Israel will send a
*11:32.780- 11:40.160* :  delegation. On Raffa, Mr Netanyahu did say we won't attack while keeping the population locked
*11:40.160- 11:46.640* :  in place. Any idea of how Israel might go about moving the 1.5 million Palestinians who
*11:46.640- 11:50.300* :  are currently stuck there? Well they've talked in vague terms about this idea of humanitarian
*11:50.300- 11:56.000* :  islands, the idea that they would move the population of Raffa to other parts of Gaza but that would
*11:56.000- 12:02.160* :  require Israel to find places of safety amidst the wasteland of Gaza and also places where the
*12:02.400- 12:09.040* :  civilians of Raffa could find food, shelter, water and so that will require a lot of time and a lot
*12:09.040- 12:17.180* :  of military manpower. According to a Palestinian official quoted by Reuters, mediators at those
*12:17.180- 12:25.120* :  peace talks are positive about Hamas's latest proposal. How is Israel likely to receive this idea?
*12:25.580- 12:30.880* :  I think that they will not accept any idea of a permanent ceasefire while Hamas is in place.
*12:31.000- 12:37.560* :  They've made that clear these rallies and they would I think only accept sort of later talks
*12:37.560- 12:43.500* :  about the further conduct of the war after Israeli hostages are released. Now what we understand
*12:43.500- 12:47.920* :  from the plan so far is that about 40 or 42 or something Israeli hostages would be released in
*12:47.920- 12:52.340* :  return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the identity of whom has not been disclosed but
*12:52.480- 12:57.780* :  it seems like Hamas certainly are pushing for the release of some Palestinian prisoners who
*12:58.080- 13:03.020* :  actually face very serious charges including murder and assassination attempts and the like,
*13:03.020- 13:08.360* :  so it'll be a bone of contention. But we've been here time and time again where the two sides meet
*13:08.360- 13:13.600* :  and there just is too much distance basically between the negotiating sides for a deal to be reached
*13:13.600- 13:18.940* :  so I think that nobody's holding their breath. Mark Lohan in Jerusalem as we've been hearing the
*13:18.940- 13:25.440* :  families of the 130 or so remaining Israeli hostages from the October 7th attacks by Hamas are
*13:25.440- 13:30.740* :  continuing to put pressure on Mr Netanyahu's government to secure their release from Gaza before
*13:30.740- 13:36.160* :  it's too late. Hopes had been raised of an agreement before the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan
*13:36.160- 13:41.120* :  which is now underway but there was no breakthrough. Our senior international correspondent
*13:41.120- 13:46.460* :  Uligerin reports now from Israel on the agonizing wait for the families of the captives.
*13:46.880- 14:00.420* :  A grim tally in Hebrew. Families of the hostages count the days their loved ones have been gone.
*14:01.640- 14:08.400* :  They stand outside the defense ministry in Tel Aviv blocking the traffic reminding Israel
*14:08.420- 14:14.360* :  of their loss. It's been more than five months now every day a torment.
*14:15.080- 14:22.220* :  Every morning when I wake up I make a concerted effort and say to myself now pretend to be human
*14:22.960- 14:31.100* :  so that I can get up and try to save herch my son and the other remaining 133 hostages.
*14:31.960- 14:37.440* :  What I want to do is lay in a ball on the floor weeping but that won't help them.
*14:38.000- 14:45.340* :  That's Rachel Goldberg-Polin, now a full-time campaigner. She says the clock stopped for her
*14:45.340- 14:53.680* :  on the morning of October 7th. As soon as I turned my phone on two consecutive messages came in
*14:54.260- 15:00.720* :  that had arrived at 8.11 from Hersh. The first of the messages said I love you
*15:01.160- 15:04.100* :  and the second one immediately after said I'm sorry.
*15:07.700- 15:13.520* :  Hersh was caught up in the chaos and terror when Hamas attacked a music festival.
*15:14.620- 15:19.040* :  He sought refuge in a bomb shelter but Hamas threw in grenades.
*15:21.700- 15:26.820* :  There's a glimpse of Hersh in a Hamas video. His left arm blown off.
*15:27.820- 15:34.120* :  Do you believe you will get him back? I really do. Hope is mandatory and I have to believe it
*15:34.660- 15:41.160* :  that he will come back to us. My name is Nama Weinberg. I'm the cousin of Itai Svirski, kidnapped
*15:41.160- 15:47.460* :  from Kibutsberi. Nama we met you in November and at that time you were campaigning for the release
*15:47.460- 15:54.260* :  of your cousin Itai. Tell me what you have learned about what happened to Itai. The Itai was executed
*15:55.000- 16:02.080* :  by the terrorists that guard him. We know he shot him a very short time after there was a near
*16:02.080- 16:10.200* :  by airstrike and we really want Itai to be the last one we don't want any other hostage to go
*16:10.200- 16:20.760* :  through what he went through. Hersh's mother Rachel is still waiting. She says the agony must end
*16:21.500- 16:28.900* :  and not only in Israel. There are thousands and thousands of innocent civilians in Gaza
*16:28.900- 16:35.460* :  who are suffering. There is so much suffering to go around and I would love for our leaders,
*16:35.460- 16:42.820* :  all of them to say we're going to do what we have to do so that just the normal people can stop
*16:42.820- 16:49.040* :  suffering. Everybody's going to have to give in. There's no perfect scenario and we need the
*16:49.040- 16:55.440* :  suffering to stop. Rachel Goldberg-Pollin, whose son Hersh is a hostage ending that report
*16:56.160- 17:02.700* :  by Ola Gehrin. Let's look at something rather different now and it is possible to learn to be
*17:02.700- 17:07.700* :  happy. That is the conclusion of a new study carried out at Bristol University here in the UK.
*17:07.740- 17:13.480* :  It has a ten week science of happiness course and for the first time it's assessed the mental
*17:13.480- 17:19.100* :  well-being of students two years after they took the course. The university found that if students
*17:19.100- 17:24.200* :  had made a habit out of among other things expressing gratitude, exercising, meditating or writing
*17:24.200- 17:29.960* :  a journal, then they were happier than their contemporaries. Professor Bruce Hood led the study.
*17:29.960- 17:36.280* :  He's also author of a new book The Science of Happiness. He spoke to Audrey Brown and explained
*17:36.280- 17:41.660* :  first what exactly happiness is. It's trying to see our own positions in relation to everything
*17:41.660- 17:47.080* :  else and trying to find the things which make us more settled, trying to not be overly competitive,
*17:47.080- 17:52.200* :  not to aspire to unrealistic goals. It's been content and that will generate those
*17:52.200- 17:57.000* :  positive emotional feelings as well. You use the word content which I quite like. I was going to say
*17:57.000- 18:02.980* :  smug. No, not smug. That smug is really demeaning your neighbor or feeling competitive against others.
*18:03.380- 18:07.620* :  In fact, that's the reason so many of us are unhappy because we're comparing ourselves
*18:07.620- 18:11.740* :  unrealistically on social media. It does sound a little bit strange to have to practice
*18:11.740- 18:17.560* :  being happy or working at it. It's kind of counterintuitive almost. Yeah, well, the trouble is,
*18:17.560- 18:21.420* :  is that we have a brain which is optimized for seeking out problems which is why the news is full
*18:21.420- 18:25.580* :  of it all the time because we've evolved to try and protect ourselves and ensure that we live long
*18:25.580- 18:30.460* :  enough to pass on our genes. And so we readily adapt to situations and that's why you need to actively
*18:30.460- 18:35.080* :  practice positive psychology in order to see the benefits of it. Why were you keen to establish
*18:35.080- 18:40.680* :  a science of happiness department as it were? I've been a bit dismayed by the kind of industry
*18:40.680- 18:45.240* :  of self-help and self-care. I mean, I call my book actually a self-destruct book rather
*18:45.240- 18:50.160* :  of self-help because I think individualism and this obsession of making sure that you're happy
*18:50.160- 18:53.780* :  and everyone else has to change around you is the wrong message. I think we need to find
*18:53.780- 18:58.140* :  our connections, our commonalities and that will generate much more sustained happiness.
*18:58.440- 19:03.020* :  The reason it doesn't last as long is, and by the way, it's a balance between self-care and
*19:03.020- 19:07.340* :  others, not entirely giving yourself over to others. But the reason that happiness
*19:07.340- 19:11.680* :  direction towards others lasts longer is more sustaining is that if you're the instigator and the
*19:11.680- 19:16.160* :  beaver of your own happiness, you know when it ceases to deliver anything. Whereas if you enrich
*19:16.160- 19:20.000* :  a lot of eggs of others around you, that produces much more sustained authentic happiness,
*19:20.260- 19:24.160* :  and also you're never sure when they really get bored of it. The fact is some studies showing if
*19:24.160- 19:28.280* :  you look at the brain imaging of people who are doing acts of kindness, the same areas which
*19:28.280- 19:32.380* :  light up when they're doing things for themselves are increased when they're doing things for others.
*19:32.380- 19:35.120* :  So an effect by helping others, you're actually making yourself happy.
*19:35.460- 19:37.500* :  Professor Bruce heard talking to Audrey Brown.
*19:40.360- 19:42.380* :  Still to come on the global news podcast.
*19:42.380- 19:50.140* :  It's a fear that I have to leave with every day less than four kilometers from where I am.
*19:50.140- 19:53.020* :  There are neighborhoods where most people have to flee.
*19:53.760- 19:57.640* :  The Haitians living in terror as gang violence gets ever closer.
*20:06.420- 20:12.100* :  A BBC investigation has uncovered extensive abuse of African women working in Oman
*20:12.100- 20:16.300* :  as domestic servants. Dozens of Malawi and women who've been
*20:16.300- 20:21.760* :  lured there by recruiting agents told BBC Africa i that they were beaten, raped,
*20:21.760- 20:24.760* :  and treated like prisoners while working in the Gulf country.
*20:25.440- 20:30.220* :  Azizat Ola Lua met some of those affected and a warning that this report contains
*20:30.220- 20:34.220* :  distressing details from the start. I feel like I'm in prison.
*20:37.760- 20:41.580* :  This is audio from videos which were recorded by domestic workers in Oman.
*20:47.360- 20:50.860* :  They are all from Malawi, one of the world's poorest countries.
*20:51.300- 20:55.360* :  The very first day I arrived at my passport was taking away from me.
*20:55.360- 20:58.860* :  They know whatever they can do to us. We can never escape.
*20:59.600- 21:02.480* :  The chef footage of their cramped sports living conditions
*21:02.480- 21:08.000* :  often communicating whilst hiding in a toilet in order to speak without being discovered.
*21:08.880- 21:13.940* :  The women came together in a WhatsApp group after being duped by dishonest recruitment agents
*21:14.400- 21:15.420* :  into going to Oman.
*21:16.660- 21:22.460* :  Jojina was promised a lucrative job in Dubai but instead she found herself in the Omani capital
*21:22.460- 21:33.100* :  Moscat. I was not allowed to rest. I was waking up at 3 a.m. and going to bed at 1 a.m.
*21:34.100- 21:39.560* :  The most difficult thing that made me desperate to escape was the boss forcing me to have sex with him.
*21:40.700- 21:46.940* :  It was so painful because I had no way to say no. He threatened me and said if I shouted he would
*21:46.940- 21:55.920* :  shoot me. I got badly injured because it wasn't only him. He would bring friends and they would
*21:55.920- 22:03.240* :  pay him after. It's common for households in the Gulf to have live inmates. In Oman alone
*22:03.620- 22:09.140* :  there are an estimated 300,000 domestic workers, most of them from Africa or Asia.
*22:10.060- 22:14.060* :  Under the Kafala sponsorship system they are legally bound to their employer.
*22:15.080- 22:19.380* :  Ekaterina runs an NGO which supports migrant workers in the Gulf.
*22:20.020- 22:26.760* :  The laws that are in place prohibit a domestic worker to leave the employer. She can
*22:26.760- 22:31.980* :  change jobs and she can't leave the country no matter how you are treated.
*22:38.580- 22:43.640* :  The Malawi government asked Ekaterina to help negotiate the release of over 50 women.
*22:44.420- 22:49.780* :  One woman, 23-year-old Ida died in Oman and her body was also brought home.
*22:50.860- 22:56.340* :  The Malawi government says it has paid over 160,000 dollars for these women to return.
*22:57.080- 22:59.900* :  Ekaterina believes this sets a dangerous precedent.
*23:00.400- 23:08.200* :  The majority of these women have been released because my husband has been paid to the employer.
*23:09.220- 23:14.500* :  From 1000 to 2000 dollars per person just for the release. How can you buy somebody else's freedom?
*23:14.500- 23:21.840* :  Oman's liberal ministry has told the BBC that it only received one complaint from a Malawi
*23:21.840- 23:28.240* :  and domestic worker in the two years to 2023. It said it is prohibited for employers to impose
*23:28.240- 23:34.160* :  any form of forced labor on workers or to keep their private documents without their written consent.
*23:38.520- 23:43.080* :  The European Union has been accused of rewarding authoritarianism in Egypt,
*23:43.660- 23:48.620* :  after signing a new $8 billion deal, which will include efforts to try to reduce the flow of
*23:48.620- 23:53.280* :  migrants heading across the Mediterranean. Egypt, which has struggling economy,
*23:53.280- 23:59.020* :  says it deserves support for hosting 9 million displaced foreigners. Human rights groups,
*23:59.020- 24:03.000* :  though, have criticised the agreement. Our Middle East editor, Sebastian Asher,
*24:03.000- 24:07.240* :  told me more about why the EU was strengthening ties with the Egyptian government.
*24:07.780- 24:11.420* :  I think it's a sense in the EU that Egypt, as you were saying,
*24:11.420- 24:16.140* :  Egypt's economy hasn't been strong for a very long time. It's been a particularly bad situation
*24:16.140- 24:23.760* :  over the past few years, that if it were to go deeper into those problems that another political
*24:23.760- 24:29.420* :  collapse in Egypt in a region that has already embroiled in the war between Israel and Hamas,
*24:29.780- 24:34.000* :  that essentially guys are being on the border with Egypt would make things even worse.
*24:34.080- 24:38.880* :  So this is an attempt to bolster the stability of Egypt through its economy, through a series of
*24:38.880- 24:44.540* :  grants and loans, up to $8 billion. It does come at a time that Egypt is in a slightly better
*24:44.540- 24:50.160* :  situation. It's just done a deal with the UAE of the same kind of amount of money, which has
*24:50.480- 24:55.980* :  helped it to deal with some of its real problems, the fact that it's so deeply indebted,
*24:56.440- 25:00.540* :  has been the key issue with the economy. And that's one of the things which has driven
*25:00.540- 25:06.100* :  Egyptians in recent years to actually go on these migrant routes. That's what is a
*25:06.100- 25:11.340* :  heart of the EU was also spoken about trying to diversify further from Russia in its energy
*25:11.340- 25:16.800* :  supplies. So part of this deal is to develop and encourage the reserves that Egypt has so they can
*25:16.800- 25:23.960* :  go to EU. Sebastian Usher, our Middle East regional editor. The US has chartered a plane to help
*25:23.960- 25:29.840* :  its citizens escape from the widespread gang violence in Haiti. The flight left the northern
*25:29.840- 25:34.840* :  coastal city of Cappassian. The airport in the capital port at Prince is closed,
*25:34.840- 25:41.840* :  from there will grant reports. After weeks of a security and humanitarian crisis in Haiti,
*25:41.840- 25:46.980* :  in which many embassies have airlifted out all non-essential staff, the US State Department has
*25:46.980- 25:52.160* :  now laid on a charter flight between Cappassian and Florida for Americans to stuck in the country.
*25:53.120- 25:57.840* :  Around two dozen US citizens did take the opportunity to leave, including one man who told
*25:57.840- 26:02.480* :  the BBC he was going to receive medical attention in Miami. The extent of the humanitarian
*26:02.480- 26:06.880* :  emergency has turned Cappassian into the main safe haven in the country for people fleeing the
*26:06.880- 26:13.100* :  violence in Porto Prince. The UN estimates that more than 350,000 people are internally displaced
*26:13.100- 26:18.920* :  and that figure is thought to be rising by the day. Will Grant, the police say many gang members
*26:18.920- 26:24.300* :  were killed in a weekend operation to clear roadblocks and seize weapons in a district of Porto
*26:24.540- 26:29.580* :  Prince. A second operation has been underway since Saturday to try to regain control of the
*26:29.580- 26:35.900* :  main port. Jet Trey Dumont has a journalist and director and co-founder of the iibo post-news
*26:35.900- 26:40.940* :  platform in Porto Prince. He gave Audrey Brown an update about the situation where he was.
*26:41.620- 26:48.420* :  We have been lucky because gang activities have not reached or area yet.
*26:48.420- 26:50.980* :  Is there a fear that they will reach where you are?
*26:51.120- 26:57.260* :  Definitely, it's a fear that I have to leave with every day to tell you the truth. Less than
*26:57.420- 27:03.480* :  four kilometers from where I am. There are neighborhoods where most people have to flee.
*27:04.000- 27:07.920* :  How are you able to live with that level of uncertainty?
*27:08.700- 27:13.640* :  It's very difficult to live with. You have to always stay in touch with family members,
*27:13.640- 27:18.840* :  with friends and with colleagues to understand how one can help each other.
*27:19.300- 27:25.300* :  When the violence breaks out, are they targeting people in those areas? Is it a turf war?
*27:25.300- 27:27.080* :  Is it a way of terrorizing people?
*27:27.340- 27:34.560* :  The gangs in Haiti lately has had method very similar to terrorist methods and that's why
*27:34.560- 27:41.800* :  maybe it's time to consider those so-called gangs as terrorist organizations. They bring terror
*27:42.100- 27:48.460* :  and terror how they bring it. It's crime, collective rape, but now you have a coalition of gang.
*27:48.460- 27:54.420* :  They have now what seems to be a political agenda. What happened two weeks ago,
*27:54.420- 28:01.480* :  with the prison break, with the 4,000 inmates that are out, the gang seems to be positioning
*28:01.520- 28:09.040* :  themselves to negotiate a possible amnesty, but they're positioning themselves also to have an
*28:09.040- 28:16.100* :  impact in any political negotiation happening around the new transition that is being negotiated
*28:16.100- 28:17.480* :  right now in Caracom.
*28:17.880- 28:22.340* :  Jetry Dumont, well the plan to create a Transitional Presidential Council for Haiti,
*28:22.340- 28:28.400* :  is also supported by the UN and the US as well as Caracom, the Caribbean Regional Grouping.
*28:28.800- 28:34.040* :  But is it the solution to the chaos? A question Julian Marshall put to Ralph Gonzalez,
*28:34.140- 28:38.060* :  the Prime Minister of the Caribbean Nation of St Vincent and the Grenadines?
*28:38.620- 28:44.920* :  Once the politicians and civil society leaders play their hard to wisdom,
*28:44.980- 28:51.340* :  we should have such an arrangement in place so that the consulate ministers can approve this
*28:51.380- 28:58.300* :  body and then to appoint an interim prime minister upon the demitting office of Prime Minister R.E.
*28:58.480- 29:05.100* :  One of the potential setbacks is the fact that this Transitional Council has been rejected by
*29:05.100- 29:11.680* :  the powerful Haitian gang leader Jimmy Cherizier. He says you'll have nothing to do with it.
*29:11.760- 29:17.180* :  The Presidential Council is not intended to mute all contradictions which exist in Haitian
*29:17.180- 29:22.880* :  society. It is to provide a free of work for governance and for stability and for security
*29:22.880- 29:28.640* :  and for humanitarian assistance and for prosperity, prepare the way for fresh elections within
*29:28.640- 29:29.680* :  12 to 18 months.
*29:29.960- 29:39.380* :  But how can that happen when gangs rule most of the capital porto prints and are extending their
*29:39.820- 29:41.520* :  influence even as we speak?
*29:41.680- 29:47.840* :  While the sooner the political leaders in Haiti and the interfaith leaders finalize the
*29:47.840- 29:54.080* :  Presidential Council and the sooner they do it better, if not, there is potential for a
*29:54.080- 29:59.460* :  bonapartist solution which is not in the interests of the security of the region.
*29:59.820- 30:02.280* :  But that's already happening. Haiti is unraveling.
*30:02.280- 30:07.480* :  No, no, no. I think you're going to extreme my brother. You are correct that they're the
*30:07.480- 30:14.960* :  influence and power of gangs but they're also large numbers of people who want peace,
*30:15.400- 30:20.940* :  security, good governance and development for Haiti. You're going to have ongoing battles
*30:20.940- 30:26.740* :  and struggles but you have to have a reasonable governance arrangement in place which is all
*30:26.740- 30:32.200* :  inclusive of all the legitimate forces. I wouldn't give up as you're suggesting. I acknowledge
*30:32.200- 30:39.240* :  that there's the presence and the power of the gangs. That is why the Haitian leaders have to
*30:39.240- 30:44.300* :  move swiftly to have this Presidential Council in place so that other things will be triggered
*30:44.300- 30:47.940* :  including the multinational security support service.
*30:48.120- 30:53.360* :  The Prime Minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines Ralph Gonzalez talking to Julian Marshall.
*30:53.900- 30:58.680* :  A far-right Austrian politician has been blocked from giving a speech in Switzerland.
*30:59.420- 31:01.740* :  Martin Selner is the leader of Austria's so-called
*31:01.740- 31:06.640* :  identitarian movement and has advocated the mass deportation of immigrants.
*31:06.640- 31:12.260* :  He's classed as a right-wing extremist in Germany where his secret meetings with members
*31:12.260- 31:16.820* :  of Germany's far-right AFD party last year triggered widespread protests.
*31:17.500- 31:19.100* :  Imogen folks reports from Bern.
*31:19.600- 31:25.760* :  Martin Selner was due to speak in the Swiss canton of Argaon Saturday on his pet topic of
*31:25.760- 31:32.400* :  remigration, the forced deportation of immigrants, but local police said he had no permission to
*31:32.400- 31:39.120* :  hold a public meeting and shut it down, escorting Mr Selner out of the canton and banning him from
*31:39.120- 31:45.980* :  returning for two months. It's a sign in Switzerland where 25% of the population is not Swiss,
*31:45.980- 31:52.920* :  is sensitive about maintaining social harmony, but some argue that by so publicly preventing the
*31:52.920- 32:00.120* :  meeting to which only around a hundred people had turned up, the police gifted Mr Selner far more
*32:00.120- 32:05.240* :  attention than he would otherwise have received. Imogen folks in Switzerland.
*32:06.180- 32:11.140* :  Finally, the English singer-songwriter Steve Harley who fronted the band Cockney Rebel has
*32:11.140- 32:17.760* :  died at the age of 73. His best-known song Make Me Smile reached number one in Britain in 1975.
*32:17.820- 32:22.920* :  He'd been forced to cancel performances last year after being diagnosed with cancer.
*32:23.420- 32:24.720* :  This report from David Silliter.
*32:30.740- 32:33.220* :  Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel and Make Me Smile.
*32:33.780- 32:37.840* :  It wasn't just a huge hit, it was one of those songs that never seemed to have gone away.
*32:44.100- 32:46.920* :  And right from the beginning there was a feeling about it.
*32:51.160- 32:54.200* :  There was ask me, did you know at the time that it would be a big hit?
*32:54.740- 32:59.820* :  Actually we did think it would be. I knew the managing director of EMI at the time came to Abbey Road
*32:59.820- 33:05.200* :  where I was mixing it and he said number one. During his 70s heyday there was more than a touch of
*33:05.300- 33:11.580* :  glam theatricality and single-mindedness. Some of that determination grew out of his childhood.
*33:12.280- 33:17.920* :  Polio had kept him in hospital for years. But during those years he developed a passion for music.
*33:18.620- 33:23.900* :  And after a spell as a journalist he began train at his songs at folk clubs before finally hitting
*33:23.900- 33:32.700* :  the big time. The effects of his childhood polio were lifelong. But on stage in the spotlight he
*33:32.700- 33:39.060* :  said it was the one place he could forget it all. And simply be Steve Harley, the rock star.
*33:41.900- 33:43.620* :  That report by David Sillito.
*33:46.740- 33:51.000* :  And that is all from us for now but the global news podcast will be back very soon. This
*33:51.000- 33:55.380* :  edition was mixed by Joe McCartney and produced by Emma Joseph, our editors Karen Martin.
