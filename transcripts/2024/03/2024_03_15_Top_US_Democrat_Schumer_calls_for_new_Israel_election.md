*01:34.700- 01:37.540* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:39.820- 01:44.040* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Friday the 15th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:44.040- 01:49.380* :  The US leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, has urged Israel to hold an election,
*01:50.160- 01:53.240* :  describing Benjamin Netanyahu as an obstacle to peace.
*01:53.920- 01:58.760* :  The US ambassador to Hungary has accused the Prime Minister Victor Orb√°n of unhinged
*01:58.800- 02:04.340* :  anti-American messaging and has warned him about his close relationship with Vladimir Putin.
*02:05.080- 02:10.620* :  Spain's lower house of parliament has voted to give amnesty to Catalan separatists who defy
*02:10.620- 02:14.540* :  the government in Madrid to hold an independence referendum in 2017.
*02:16.860- 02:17.780* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:25.080- 02:31.040* :  another SpaceX test flight and another step closer to NASA's dreams of returning astronauts
*02:31.040- 02:32.400* :  to the moon and beyond.
*02:35.260- 02:39.540* :  The US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for an election in Israel,
*02:39.540- 02:44.260* :  saying the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu no longer meets the needs of his country.
*02:44.700- 02:48.840* :  Mr Schumer is a Democrat and America's highest-ranking Jewish politician.
*02:49.360- 02:53.400* :  He accused Mr Netanyahu of pursuing dangerous and inflammatory policies.
*02:54.140- 02:59.900* :  Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost his way by allowing his political survival
*02:59.900- 03:04.320* :  to take the precedence over the best interests of Israel.
*03:05.480- 03:09.300* :  He has put himself in coalition with far-right extremists,
*03:09.300- 03:11.440* :  like Minister Smotrik and Ben Gavir.
*03:11.780- 03:16.340* :  And as a result, he has been too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza,
*03:17.060- 03:20.960* :  which is pushing support for Israel worldwide to historic lows.
*03:21.920- 03:27.680* :  Mr Netanyahu's lecuteparty has responded to Senator Schumer, saying Israel is not a banana
*03:27.680- 03:31.500* :  republic but a proud democracy that elected its Prime Minister.
*03:31.500- 03:37.160* :  The statement said a senator should respect Israel's elected government and not undermine it,
*03:37.620- 03:39.180* :  even more so in wartime.
*03:39.820- 03:42.080* :  Here's our North America correspondent, Tom Bateman.
*03:42.760- 03:47.420* :  Well, it's no secret that Chuck Schumer is a critic and an outspoken one of the current
*03:47.420- 03:53.820* :  Israeli coalition, but this was a far more significant intervention than we have heard from him
*03:54.200- 04:00.400* :  thus far, and given his position as the leader of the majority of the Democrats in the United
*04:00.400- 04:07.440* :  States Senate, describing himself as the highest ranking Jewish elected official in American history,
*04:07.500- 04:13.400* :  he then went on to really excoriate the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*04:13.700- 04:16.500* :  Now, during this very long speech, he was about 45 minutes.
*04:16.500- 04:21.720* :  He started by saying that people should understand, as far as he was concerned, that Hamas bore
*04:21.720- 04:28.040* :  the responsibility for unleashing the current war, but he then spoke about the impact of what he
*04:28.040- 04:33.780* :  called the Israeli war machine in terms of the scale of civilian suffering in Gaza,
*04:34.440- 04:38.080* :  but then moved on really to the longer term outlook.
*04:38.080- 04:43.180* :  And he made it very clear that the only way through all this, in his view, was a two-state
*04:43.180- 04:48.660* :  solution, Israel side by side with an independent, but he said demilitarized Palestinian state,
*04:49.100- 04:53.320* :  and he then listed what he said were the four obstacles to this outcome.
*04:53.320- 04:57.580* :  He listed Hamas, he listed extremist members of the Israeli government,
*04:57.580- 05:02.420* :  he listed the Palestinian Authority leadership, and he also listed the Israeli Prime Minister
*05:02.420- 05:07.360* :  Benjamin Netanyahu, and repeatedly said these were the four obstacles to peace,
*05:07.740- 05:12.500* :  and he said that if the current Israeli coalition continued along its current course,
*05:12.500- 05:18.040* :  which he said was effectively an outlook to take all of the land that Israel would have control
*05:18.040- 05:22.980* :  over all of the land where Israelis and Palestinians live, he said that that would lead to
*05:23.500- 05:30.140* :  international support for Israel declining further, and he said it would become a pariah state.
*05:30.720- 05:35.980* :  So this was extremely outspoken, called for elections in Israel, that is something that will
*05:35.980- 05:39.980* :  rile, and has already riled as we've heard from that statement from Lecude, the current Israeli
*05:39.980- 05:44.640* :  government. And he said that that is the way to have a sort of moment as the war wound down,
*05:44.640- 05:49.200* :  he said, of debate and discussion about the way through. He said that he thought that Israeli
*05:49.200- 05:54.940* :  government had lost its way in terms of its current course and called for elections and is
*05:54.940- 05:59.240* :  effectively calling for the replacement of Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister.
*05:59.740- 06:05.740* :  Tom Bateman. Meanwhile, the United States has imposed sanctions on three Israeli settlers and
*06:05.740- 06:12.440* :  two settler farming outposts in the occupied West Bank, all are accused of undermining stability
*06:12.500- 06:17.820* :  there. It's the second time this year that Washington has imposed sanctions in response to rising
*06:17.820- 06:23.580* :  settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank since the Hamas attack on southern
*06:23.580- 06:30.880* :  Israel in October. The move freezes any U.S. assets of the sanctioned individuals and entities
*06:31.440- 06:38.300* :  and prohibits Americans from dealing with them. Cancer patients in Gaza say they're being denied
*06:38.300- 06:44.480* :  exit for life-saving treatment through the rougher crossing to Egypt despite their names appearing
*06:44.480- 06:51.040* :  on authorized evacuation lists. In parallel, fees charged by an Egyptian company arranging
*06:51.040- 06:57.520* :  evacuations from Gaza have rocketed during the war, becoming unaffordable for most. The BBC's
*06:57.520- 07:06.480* :  Lara El-Gaballi reports. I'm on my way to the border crossing. Hopefully, I will find my name
*07:06.480- 07:12.200* :  there and be able to travel. God willing. This is Sehem's third time trying to leave Gaza.
*07:13.120- 07:18.380* :  She was being treated for leukemia when the conflict began, leaving her and almost 10,000 other
*07:18.380- 07:25.680* :  cancer patients in Gaza without treatment. I read that my name was published on the Rafaq
*07:25.680- 07:32.140* :  ordination groups. My name was published on the departure list twice. I have been to the crossing
*07:32.140- 07:38.540* :  point twice for no reason. I was turned away. Despite her name being on an evacuation list
*07:38.540- 07:44.000* :  for Turkey on November 19th, Sehem was turned away by Palestinian border agents who said the
*07:44.000- 07:50.520* :  Turkish envoy wasn't there to receive her. But we found that that wasn't the case. He spoke to
*07:50.520- 07:55.500* :  Mona Al-Shurafi who has breast cancer and was on the same evacuation list as Sehem.
*07:56.940- 08:01.660* :  She was allowed to leave for Turkey that day and was even able to bring her two daughters with her.
*08:02.180- 08:10.340* :  After I got through the crossing onto the Egyptian side, I saw the Turkish council waiting for us
*08:10.780- 08:15.640* :  and I knew I was going to Turkey. We've spoken to two other cancer patients who have been turned
*08:15.640- 08:21.660* :  away at the border despite their names being on the official evacuation lists. Officials in Turkey
*08:21.660- 08:28.280* :  told the BBC they have the capacity to treat many hundreds more cancer patients. But only 600
*08:28.280- 08:38.140* :  cancer patients from Gaza have managed to leave since October 7th. Israel Vets who is allowed
*08:38.140- 08:44.020* :  to leave Gaza. The Israeli Ministry of Defence told us that they have no restrictions on the number
*08:44.020- 08:50.040* :  of patients allowed to leave for medical treatment. Palestinian border authorities declined
*08:50.040- 08:57.220* :  to comment on Sehem's case. But it seems there are other ways to leave Gaza. A lucrative monopoly
*08:57.220- 09:04.120* :  has emerged from the war. With one Egyptian travel agency, hella, charging Palestinians $5,000 per
*09:04.120- 09:10.760* :  person to exit Gaza within one to two weeks. This is more than four times the annual average salary in Gaza.
*09:12.120- 09:16.960* :  This man says he had to pay an employee in extra $300 to get his family on the evacuation list.
*09:17.880- 09:20.440* :  He didn't want to be identified so we've changed his voice.
*09:23.880- 09:28.020* :  They weren't letting anyone in. If you wanted to go in, you had to pay to be
*09:28.020- 09:35.940* :  letting. So then you could pay the $5,000. The fee was $5,000 for an adult and $2,500 for a child
*09:35.940- 09:41.620* :  for Palestinian passport holders. He is one of 10 people who told us they made extra payments
*09:41.620- 09:47.360* :  of up to $4,000 to hella employees to get their families evacuated. But it seems the best
*09:47.360- 09:52.460* :  connected in Gaza can leave without paying at all. We found the names of Palestinians on an
*09:52.460- 09:57.600* :  evacuation list meant for Egyptians. One of them told us they were helped to leave Gaza by someone
*09:57.600- 10:02.980* :  with political connections. Neither hella nor the Egyptian foreign ministry responded to our questions.
*10:05.840- 10:09.300* :  In Gaza, time is running out for Sehem whose cancer is spreading.
*10:09.880- 10:20.420* :  We are suffering now. My medicine is finished. I'm so tired, I can hardly see in front of me,
*10:21.160- 10:26.460* :  no blood tests or anything. My chemotherapy ran out a long time ago.
*10:28.720- 10:32.940* :  Without the money or connections, many patients like Sehem have been left behind.
*10:34.100- 10:36.560* :  That report was by Lara El-Gabali.
*10:38.300- 10:44.220* :  The pioneering starship rocket developed by Elon Musk's company SpaceX has made its
*10:44.220- 10:51.160* :  longest and most ambitious test flight so far. Contact with Starship was broken as it began its
*10:51.160- 10:56.700* :  reentry into Earth's atmosphere. SpaceX confirmed that the craft was lost but it completed nearly
*10:56.700- 11:02.340* :  an entire test flight on its third attempt. The rocket jet blasted off from Texas and had been due
*11:02.340- 11:08.300* :  to splash down in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX hopes Starship will eventually fly astronauts
*11:08.300- 11:12.140* :  to the moon and beyond. Here's our science correspondent Jonathan Amos.
*11:21.040- 11:25.480* :  With a mighty rumble, the giant rocket lifted clear of its text and launch complex,
*11:25.900- 11:31.640* :  all 33 engines firing at full power. The entrepreneur, Elon Musk, was looking for significant
*11:31.640- 11:34.580* :  progress from his SpaceX team and he got it.
*11:39.260- 11:44.800* :  The Ascent looked flawless. Separation of the bottom half, the booster from the top half of the ship
*11:45.220- 11:49.420* :  occurred right on cue, with the ship then piring onwards out over the Atlantic.
*11:50.140- 11:56.340* :  Video cameras sent back spectacular views of Earth. Then came the task of reentry for a splashdown
*11:56.340- 11:57.380* :  in the Indian Ocean.
*12:01.740- 12:07.540* :  Video imagery again captured incredible scenes as hot gases enveloped the vehicle just before
*12:07.540- 12:13.940* :  radio contact went down. Controllers reported shortly after the ship had been lost, presumably
*12:13.940- 12:18.980* :  because it had broken up. That will have disappointed engineers but they'll know now that the
*12:18.980- 12:24.640* :  development of the world's most powerful rocket is firmly on track. The aim is for Starship
*12:24.700- 12:30.140* :  to be totally reusable, to fly again and again like an aeroplane. If that can be achieved,
*12:30.140- 12:33.440* :  it would dramatically lower the cost of space activity.
*12:34.020- 12:39.700* :  Jonathan Amos. The US ambassador to Hungary has launched a stinging attack on the Hungarian
*12:39.700- 12:45.300* :  Prime Minister, Victor Orban, deepening around between the two countries. Speaking in Budapest,
*12:45.300- 12:50.300* :  David Pressman warned that Mr Orban's close and expanding relationship with Russia and
*12:50.300- 12:56.060* :  President Vladimir Putin was a security concern that could not be ignored. Nick Thorpe reports.
*12:56.900- 13:02.940* :  David Pressman made the remarks in a speech to mark the 25th anniversary of Hungary joining NATO.
*13:03.700- 13:10.820* :  US concerns about the close relationship between Budapest and Moscow are shared by 31 NATO allies
*13:10.820- 13:16.880* :  Mr. Pressman said. If this is Hungary's policy choice, he added, we will have to decide
*13:16.880- 13:23.260* :  how best to protect our security interests. This was the starkest warning from the Biden
*13:24.100- 13:27.560* :  administration to Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban so far.
*13:28.300- 13:35.080* :  Nick Thorpe. Next to Germany and a group of protesters who are camping high in the trees outside
*13:35.080- 13:42.120* :  Elon Musk's Tesla factory in the country could face eviction from Friday. Plans to expand the plant,
*13:42.120- 13:48.340* :  which employs 12,000 people, have been facing fresh environmental protests. Tesla says its team
*13:48.340- 13:53.800* :  is helping to improve local biodiversity and its focus on creating sustainable factories.
*13:54.500- 13:57.980* :  Our Berlin Correspondent Jessica Parker reports from the state of Brandenburg.
*14:03.120- 14:09.520* :  In a pine forest about 30 kilometres outside Berlin, I climb a ladder. This is quite high actually.
*14:10.580- 14:14.160* :  I've never loved heights, but this feels pretty sturdy.
*14:16.040- 14:23.120* :  So we've come up about 20 feet into the trees. We're in a wooden deck, some orange tarpaulin
*14:23.780- 14:30.060* :  covering what is basically actually a workshop where they're storing nails and words and rope
*14:30.820- 14:33.480* :  and helmets. It's all part of the work of the camp.
*14:35.020- 14:40.040* :  This is one of several tree houses making up the camp near Europe's only Tesla factory.
*14:40.040- 14:45.560* :  The electric car company headed up by the charismatic but controversial Elon Musk.
*14:50.040- 14:54.400* :  These activists want to frustrate plans for the factories expansion into the forest,
*14:54.400- 14:57.560* :  but as I find out from one of the campaigners Magpie,
*14:59.100- 15:05.440* :  up with trees down with campers. Yeah, that's like the motto. Their protest is about much more.
*15:05.840- 15:08.660* :  We don't want to cut the forest down. We want to save
*15:09.280- 15:12.580* :  or to protect the water here, but also it's like a more international fight,
*15:12.580- 15:17.660* :  because of course electric cars also use minerals or things like lithium,
*15:17.660- 15:23.000* :  which also cause a lot of problems in, for example, Chile or Bolivia.
*15:23.580- 15:27.520* :  There's been some suggestion some of you guys are basically professional
*15:27.520- 15:31.140* :  campaigners turning up at lots of protests wherever they may be.
*15:32.420- 15:36.340* :  I mean, I think that's not true. Of course, some people are here who doing this like often
*15:36.420- 15:41.940* :  or some time, but also a lot of people here who live here next to the, or live in the village,
*15:41.940- 15:46.680* :  Grunheider, like coming here and helping us. Yeah, I also have to work. Of course,
*15:46.860- 15:48.860* :  I'm not like doing this my whole time or whole life.
*15:52.560- 15:57.340* :  He rope climbs up to his tree house. There's no ladder here. The idea, of course,
*15:57.340- 16:01.000* :  is to make a looming eviction particularly hard for the authorities.
*16:04.660- 16:10.080* :  At a railway nearby, we bump into commuters. A majority of residents in the local town voted
*16:10.080- 16:15.700* :  against the plans, but views are split. The expansion proposals include a kindergarten
*16:15.700- 16:22.300* :  for employees, warehouses and a freight train station. Actually, this is a problem for us.
*16:22.740- 16:29.360* :  I live here. I moved to Grunheider 20 years ago because we wanted to be close to the
*16:29.360- 16:34.020* :  nature and so on and we didn't expect that we would have this kind of
*16:34.620- 16:41.620* :  factory here close to the houses. I think most of the people don't agree with the people
*16:42.020- 16:47.500* :  that are camping. Most of the Tesla employees are happy that Tesla is providing work places.
*16:47.900- 16:52.480* :  I personally don't really understand the motivations of the people coming here and
*16:53.300- 17:00.700* :  attacking our power system. That attack on the power system was a suspected arson attack
*17:01.120- 17:06.020* :  on an electricity pile on that led to factory production being suspended for a week.
*17:09.540- 17:14.760* :  But campaigners at the camps say that was not them. In fact, far-left militant activists
*17:14.760- 17:19.880* :  called the Volcano Group have claimed responsibility. Police are investigating.
*17:25.620- 17:30.860* :  A Tesla video released this week sent the message that the factory was booming back to life.
*17:30.860- 17:37.500* :  Elon Musk even visited the plant, having described the pylon saboteurs as dumb eco-terrorists.
*17:37.900- 17:43.460* :  Meanwhile, Tesla says it wants to create sustainable factories and support local communities.
*17:44.320- 17:49.940* :  But American powerhouse capitalism is meeting radical German eco-activism.
*17:50.440- 17:52.980* :  It's likely that battle isn't over yet.
*17:57.380- 18:00.020* :  That report was by Jessica Parker in Germany.
*18:03.260- 18:07.280* :  Still to come, we hear about a huge Philippines-based love scam.

*20:00.900- 20:06.420* :  The motive behind the abduction of nearly 300 school children in northern Nigeria last week
*20:06.920- 20:11.680* :  appears to be simple greed. Ransom demands have been made by the kidnappers,
*20:11.680- 20:16.520* :  but many of the families are very poor and the money demanded more than half a million dollars
*20:16.520- 20:21.780* :  is way beyond what they can afford. I spoke to our Africa regional editor, Will Ross.
*20:22.620- 20:27.700* :  Well, we've heard from a community leader in Kurega, the area of Kaduna State,
*20:27.700- 20:34.880* :  where the children and some teachers were taken from. This man, Gibriel Guadabbe told the BBC that
*20:35.720- 20:43.600* :  he had spoken with the group, including the kidnappers as well, but also heard from the head
*20:43.600- 20:51.020* :  teacher who was taken with them and heard that the children aged between 7 and 12 are in a pretty
*20:51.020- 20:57.440* :  sorry state mainly because of the very long trek they were forced to go on through the bush to
*20:57.440- 21:04.800* :  get to the kind of lair where these kidnapping gangs are based in forests. He said that some of them
*21:04.800- 21:09.220* :  couldn't stand up. They were so weak and also talked about how little food and water
*21:09.920- 21:14.460* :  is available for them, you know, sleeping out under the trees. It's pretty rough conditions
*21:14.620- 21:19.180* :  and frankly he fears that some of them won't survive. Well, I was saying that a lot of these
*21:19.180- 21:24.200* :  parents are very simple people, not particularly wealthy. How likely is any payment of a ransom?
*21:25.300- 21:30.660* :  Well, Gibriel Guadabbe was pretty blunt when he said there's absolutely no chance of a
*21:30.660- 21:35.820* :  ransom being paid because people have so little. Many of the fathers of this children
*21:36.280- 21:43.140* :  have told you I swear to God, they are not in possession of even 5,000 men. If you ask any
*21:43.140- 21:50.300* :  parent of this children to give, let's say 20,000, I swear, many of them do not have this money.
*21:50.640- 21:55.880* :  Well, to put that into context, 5,000 there is about $3,000 isn't it? They can't even afford that.
*21:56.640- 22:00.920* :  What do you think will happen without payment? Well, it's always hard to know what goes on behind
*22:00.920- 22:06.260* :  the scenes with previous kidnappings. Clearly, huge amounts of money have been paid sometimes
*22:06.260- 22:11.900* :  involving officials, but the government and all the state government or the federal government
*22:11.900- 22:16.520* :  never admit that ransom payments are made. In fact, they've even made the paying of ransom
*22:16.520- 22:23.020* :  is illegal, but we think it still goes on. There is, of course, also a military option, but high risk,
*22:23.500- 22:27.800* :  but there are some reports that more than 4,000 people have been kidnapped since President
*22:27.800- 22:33.280* :  Inubu came into power last May, and that the fact of the matter is there haven't really been
*22:33.280- 22:39.620* :  prosecutions of the gang leaders, and for many people it looks as though it still is a reasonably
*22:39.620- 22:47.180* :  easy way to make quick money. Will Ross. Back in 2017, the streets of Barcelona and other
*22:47.180- 22:52.540* :  cities in Northeastern Spain were alive with people waving red and yellow Catalan flags.
*22:52.620- 22:58.200* :  They were part of a concerted bit for independence. In October of that year, Catalan
*22:58.200- 23:03.160* :  nationalists carried out a referendum on breaking away from Madrid, and that had been declared
*23:03.160- 23:08.240* :  illegal by the Constitutional Court. After that, a number of the organizers were imprisoned,
*23:08.240- 23:13.600* :  but now the Spanish Congress has approved a controversial amnesty law for people still facing
*23:13.600- 23:19.020* :  legal action for separatist activity. I asked our correspondent in Madrid, Guy Hegeco,
*23:19.020- 23:25.600* :  who would benefit from the amnesty? Around 300 or so Catalan nationalists are expected to benefit
*23:25.600- 23:32.680* :  from the amnesty. Many of those people have links to the failed bid for independence in 2017,
*23:32.680- 23:38.660* :  so for example, civil servants or headteachers, for example, who allowed their schools to be used
*23:38.660- 23:44.160* :  for that referendum that was deemed illegal. Many people like that have been facing legal action
*23:44.160- 23:50.620* :  ever since, but there are other much more high profile figures who have also been facing legal
*23:50.620- 23:57.780* :  action. Most notably, Carlos Pujdemon, who was the Catalan regional president back then, and he
*23:57.780- 24:03.860* :  was seen as the figurehead of the independence movement at the time, he has been exile in Belgium
*24:04.280- 24:10.100* :  ever since to avoid the reach of the Spanish courts. There are also, I should mention, police officers
*24:10.600- 24:17.040* :  who are accused of attacking Catalan voters on the day of the referendum, who could also benefit
*24:17.040- 24:21.620* :  from the amnesty as well. It sounds as though both sides of the argument, if you like, will
*24:21.620- 24:26.780* :  potentially benefit from this, and yet it's been very divisive. It was only narrowly passed,
*24:26.780- 24:32.080* :  wasn't it? Why? Yes, because the focus has really been on the nationalists who will benefit
*24:32.080- 24:38.120* :  from this. In particular, people like Carlos Pujdemon, the former Catalan president, and critics
*24:38.120- 24:46.620* :  of this amnesty say, first of all, that the amnesty is unconstitutional. They also say that
*24:46.620- 24:53.380* :  Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is only pushing this amnesty through because he needs the support
*24:54.200- 24:59.720* :  in Parliament of Catalan nationalist parties. So he's just doing this for his own political
*24:59.720- 25:06.080* :  survival, and that obviously jails with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's own claims that the amnesty
*25:06.080- 25:12.940* :  will try and reduce political and social tensions in Catalonia that were generated by that
*25:12.940- 25:19.820* :  failed bid for succession. Guy heads go in Madrid there. A royal air force plane reportedly
*25:19.820- 25:25.860* :  carrying the British Defence Secretary Grant Shaps has had its satellite signal jammed while
*25:25.860- 25:32.220* :  flying near the Russian territory of Kaliningrad. Mr Shaps was travelling back to the UK after
*25:32.220- 25:36.500* :  watching NATO military exercises. He's a diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams.
*25:37.160- 25:41.380* :  The Defence Secretary's plane was briefly jammed on both legs of a trip to Poland.
*25:41.380- 25:45.220* :  A security source told the BBC the safety of the plane was never threatened,
*25:45.220- 25:50.660* :  and that it's not unusual for aircraft to experience GPS jamming close to the strategically
*25:50.660- 25:56.940* :  important Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea. Another Western official pointed out
*25:56.940- 26:02.360* :  that Kaliningrad, which sits between two NATO members, Poland and Lithuania, has significant
*26:02.360- 26:07.260* :  electronic warfare capabilities, and that it wouldn't be surprising to see them used against
*26:07.260- 26:13.320* :  commercial aircraft. Grant Shaps was flying on an RAF corporate jet. According to the Washington
*26:13.320- 26:19.280* :  based Institute for the Study of War, Russia's use of GPS interference across Poland and the Baltic
*26:19.280- 26:25.540* :  has proliferated in recent months, possibly to disrupt NATO exercises. But it's also interfering
*26:25.540- 26:30.100* :  with commercial shipping and aircraft. Shaps and planes have other means of navigation,
*26:30.100- 26:36.580* :  but such jamming could have dangerous consequences. Russia's use of electronic warfare is also helping
*26:36.580- 26:43.660* :  Moscow to turn the tide of the war in Ukraine. Paul Adams. In London, a high court judge,
*26:43.660- 26:49.200* :  who has overseen a long-running legal battle about who invented the cryptocurrency Bitcoin,
*26:49.200- 26:56.120* :  has ruled that it is not the Australian computer scientist Dr. Craig Wright. The years Dr. Wright
*26:56.120- 27:02.960* :  has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the person or team who launched Bitcoin
*27:02.960- 27:09.500* :  in 2008, and he's challenged in court those who questioned his story. Our cyber correspondents,
*27:09.500- 27:15.540* :  Joe Tidey watched the court proceedings. Mr. Justice Mella took just a few seconds to rule that
*27:15.540- 27:20.560* :  Wright was not the inventor of Bitcoin. It had been expected that the judge would take months to
*27:20.560- 27:26.060* :  decide on this technically complex and at times techie, five-week trial. But he said the evidence
*27:26.060- 27:31.280* :  was overwhelming. During the trial, Dr. Wright was accused of carrying out a massive campaign
*27:31.280- 27:37.700* :  of dishonesty and forgery in the years since he claimed to be Bitcoin's inventor. It was in 2016
*27:37.700- 27:42.800* :  that the Australian computer scientist outed himself as the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto,
*27:42.800- 27:49.260* :  the online user who created and launched Bitcoin on the internet in 2008. Dr. Wright invited
*27:49.260- 27:53.820* :  the BBC to a demonstration to prove it, but it wasn't long before his claims were questioned,
*27:53.820- 27:59.760* :  and since then doubt has spread that he is Satoshi. He's been in and out of court multiple times
*27:59.760- 28:05.360* :  filing legal challenges against anyone who questions his story. This high court case brought by
*28:05.360- 28:10.960* :  copper, a group of Bitcoin-based businesses, appears to have put his case to bed. But the mystery
*28:10.960- 28:15.440* :  of who invented Bitcoin, which has surged in value during the trial, continues.
*28:17.980- 28:23.220* :  Police in the Philippines say that they've rescued around 700 people from a centre 100
*28:23.220- 28:28.160* :  kilometres north of the capital Manila. They say the people were working against their will
*28:28.160- 28:34.740* :  in an online love scam. Rachel Wright has more. The police raided the centre on Thursday after a
*28:34.740- 28:40.140* :  tip off from a Vietnamese man who managed to flee last month. The 30-year-old said he had arrived in
*28:40.140- 28:45.620* :  January after being offered what he was told would be a chef's job, but he soon realised that he
*28:45.620- 28:51.720* :  had fallen prey to human traffickers running love and cryptocurrency scams. He told police that he
*28:51.720- 28:56.060* :  had been forced to send online messages he described as sweet nothings to his victims,
*28:56.060- 29:01.920* :  many of whom were Chinese. The police said he showed signs of torture, including scars and marks
*29:01.920- 29:08.160* :  from electrocution. South East Asia has become a hub for scams centres where the scammers themselves
*29:08.160- 29:13.740* :  are often entrapped and forced into criminal activity. Those running the scams centres trap good
*29:13.740- 29:19.560* :  looking men and women to lure victims by posing as their online lovers. They then persuade the
*29:19.560- 29:25.180* :  victims into parting with their money. The BBC spoke to one man who didn't want to reveal his
*29:25.180- 29:30.080* :  identity for fear that his former colleagues would kill him about how he ran what he called
*29:30.080- 29:35.780* :  pig-butchering scams, named after the farming practice of fattening pigs before slaughtering them.
*29:37.220- 29:42.480* :  The profiles we make are always very handsome, very rich, responsible and caring.
*29:43.700- 29:48.720* :  The pig-butchering scam is all about exploiting emotion. This is how to win their trust.
*29:48.720- 29:56.420* :  You create a dream. I want to live with you in Beijing. We could make that happen together.
*29:57.000- 30:02.340* :  You get the investors to invest as much as possible and drain every single penny.
*30:02.820- 30:06.220* :  Joyce was one of those tricked into investing on a fake website.
*30:07.940- 30:12.940* :  The pressure I face as a leftover woman was probably the main reason I was scammed.
*30:14.100- 30:18.480* :  My scammer said he'd come to Beijing to see me in January. We could think about buying a home
*30:18.480- 30:27.540* :  together. I borrowed from nine online lenders, including my own savings. I lost about $100,000 and
*30:27.540- 30:34.860* :  my family blamed me for being stupid. The BBC also obtained footage from activists which shows how
*30:34.860- 30:42.540* :  many of the people in the centres were treated. The video show young men tied to chairs being
*30:42.540- 30:48.680* :  beaten. A UN report last August estimates that hundreds of thousands of people from around the
*30:48.680- 30:53.960* :  world have been trafficked to Southeast Asia to work in online scams. Governments across Asia
*30:53.960- 30:58.620* :  from Indonesia to Taiwan have expressed alarm at the rise in these scams centres.
*30:59.140- 31:03.700* :  Foreign embassies in countries like Cambodia and Thailand have issued warnings to their
*31:03.700- 31:10.020* :  citizens to beware of being lured into these practices. Rachel Wright, a group of wealthy
*31:10.020- 31:15.700* :  homeowners in the United States who spent more than half a million dollars creating a sand
*31:15.700- 31:21.880* :  dune to protect their seaside homes has seen the barrier vanish in just three days. Gabrielle
*31:21.880- 31:26.940* :  Stengelite reports. The group in Massachusetts had hoped to protect themselves from coastal
*31:26.940- 31:32.540* :  erosion and flooding by building a huge artificial dune using 14,000 tons of sand.
*31:33.640- 31:38.080* :  But as days after completing it, the barrier was destroyed by a storm. The homeowners
*31:38.080- 31:42.880* :  and out hoping the state authorities will help them to find a permanent solution to protect
*31:42.880- 31:49.240* :  the property. Many coastal homes are in danger in the US. An official report last year suggested that
*31:49.240- 31:55.640* :  about one in four Americans live in coastal areas are vulnerable to natural disasters. Gabrielle Stengelite
