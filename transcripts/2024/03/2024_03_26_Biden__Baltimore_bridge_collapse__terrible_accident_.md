*01:19.520- 01:22.960* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.820- 01:31.120* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Wednesday the 27th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:31.760- 01:36.260* :  President Biden promises help to rebuild a major bridge in Baltimore which was struck by
*01:36.260- 01:40.420* :  container ship and collapsed into one of America's busiest shipping lanes.
*01:40.800- 01:46.900* :  This is the largest east coast port so this is a major deal. Everything comes through here,
*01:46.900- 01:52.820* :  everything, whether it's automobiles or toothbrushes. US Supreme Court judges appear skeptical
*01:52.820- 01:59.000* :  about arguments for banning the abortion drug, Miffi Pristone and why these comments have sparked
*01:59.000- 02:05.580* :  fury in Israel. I implore Member States to abide by their obligations which start
*02:05.580- 02:08.840* :  with imposing an arms embargo and sanctions on Israel.
*02:10.760- 02:17.520* :  Also in this podcast, Indonesia launches a search for the Javan Tiger after DNA from a single
*02:17.520- 02:25.680* :  hair raises hope that the species is not extinct. And the British TV gardening show host whose trousers
*02:26.260- 02:32.720* :  faced the censorship test on North Korean TV. It's taken me to reach the age of 74
*02:33.620- 02:40.420* :  to be regarded in the same sort of breath as Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, Rod Stewart.
*02:43.460- 02:49.500* :  President Biden has described the collapse of the main bridge in Baltimore as a terrible accident
*02:49.500- 02:55.540* :  and promised all the federal resources needed to get the port up and running. Six people remain
*02:55.540- 03:01.100* :  missing after the container ship lost power before striking the Francis Scott Key bridge in the
*03:01.100- 03:06.140* :  early hours of Tuesday morning. Local authorities have declared a state of emergency. Our North
*03:06.140- 03:10.560* :  America correspondent Gary O'Donohue is in Baltimore and sent this report.
*03:11.360- 03:17.160* :  It was just before 130 in the morning that the 985-foot-long Dali container ship
*03:17.520- 03:22.980* :  struck a pylon of the bridge, bringing most of the structure crashing down into the Patapsco
*03:22.980- 03:27.180* :  river, the sound captured on a local resident's doorbell camera.
*03:30.460- 03:34.840* :  Two local residents were in their beds at the time and said they heard the crash.
*03:34.980- 03:40.840* :  It's a house. To know it wasn't like normal everyday people or in the road. It was workers and
*03:40.840- 03:45.580* :  my husband does that kind of work like road work. I don't know what could have been his friends,
*03:45.580- 03:52.900* :  scary and fun. Emergency services rushed to the scene with helicopters and boats brought in to
*03:52.900- 03:58.300* :  search for a construction team that had been working on the bridge who were believed to be in
*03:58.300- 04:04.620* :  the water. Two people were rescued. One is critically ill in hospital. It's emerged the ship's crew
*04:05.000- 04:10.360* :  managed to send a Mayday call to authorities on land before the vessel hit the bridge.
*04:11.140- 04:15.540* :  The governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, said that was critical in saving lives.
*04:16.060- 04:20.800* :  By being able to stop cars from coming over the bridge, these people are heroes.
*04:21.140- 04:25.840* :  Local investigators have made it clear they believe this was an accident and have ruled out
*04:25.840- 04:31.520* :  any suggestion of terrorism. President Biden has ordered federal resources to the scene.
*04:31.800- 04:36.240* :  I'm director of my team of heaven and earth three open the port and rebuild the bridge as soon
*04:36.240- 04:41.500* :  as you can be able to possible. For now, the port of Baltimore, one of the largest in the United
*04:41.500- 04:46.820* :  States, remains closed and the loss of the bridge, severed a key artery for large vehicles
*04:46.820- 04:52.840* :  on America's eastern seaboard. The impact of this accident will be felt for months to come.
*04:53.360- 04:58.940* :  Gary O'Donohue. The port of Baltimore is the busiest in the country for car shipments and its
*04:58.940- 05:03.980* :  closure has forced companies such as General Motors and Ford to reroute some deliveries.
*05:04.520- 05:10.340* :  It also threatens to disrupt supplies of commodities such as coal and sugar and increased delays
*05:10.340- 05:15.460* :  and costs for companies. With more details, here's our transport correspondent Katie Austin.
*05:16.220- 05:21.700* :  The Singapore flagged container ship Dali was chartered by the shipping giant MESC and operated
*05:21.700- 05:27.480* :  by the ship management company Synergy. Headed for Sri Lanka, it left the port of Baltimore at 24
*05:27.480- 05:33.900* :  minutes past midnight local time with two pilots on board. An hour later, the ship diverted from its
*05:33.900- 05:39.260* :  straight course. American media say it lost propulsion before striking the bridge, which appeared
*05:39.260- 05:44.640* :  to collapse immediately. Not only will the bridge's destruction cause significant traffic problems,
*05:44.640- 05:48.440* :  but ships are unable to enter or leave the port until further notice.
*05:48.440- 05:54.380* :  Peter Marisi, Professor Emeritus at the University of Maryland, said this would have big implications.
*05:54.380- 06:00.940* :  This is the largest east coast port. So this is kind of as close as we get to the Suez Canal.
*06:00.940- 06:06.460* :  Unlike the Suez Canal, the workarounds are somewhat more convenient, but there really isn't any
*06:06.460- 06:11.420* :  place on the east coast that can take this kind of cargo. So this is a major deal. Everything
*06:11.420- 06:15.760* :  comes through here, everything, whether it's automobiles or toothbrushes.
*06:15.940- 06:21.520* :  It's emerged that the 95,000 ton ship was previously involved in an accident while attempting
*06:21.520- 06:27.720* :  to leave the port of Antwerp in Belgium in 2016. It scraped its stern along the key, causing
*06:27.720- 06:34.260* :  damage to its hull. There were no reports of injuries or spillages. Katie Austin, abortion has
*06:34.260- 06:39.820* :  once again become the focus of the US Supreme Court following the overturning of the Roe vs. Wade
*06:39.820- 06:45.880* :  Rooting in 2022, ending a woman's right to an abortion. The court is now considering whether to
*06:45.880- 06:52.060* :  limit access to a widely used drug called Mifipristone, which is commonly used in medical abortions.
*06:52.380- 06:56.060* :  The justices have been hearing arguments on whether to restrict access to it,
*06:56.420- 07:00.940* :  following pressure from anti-abortion campaigners. Medical abortions make up more than
*07:00.940- 07:06.460* :  half of all terminations in the US. An ortho-america correspondent, Ned Aturfik, has been following
*07:06.460- 07:12.620* :  proceedings. I asked her why campaigners wanted to curtail access to this drug apart from their
*07:12.620- 07:19.140* :  opposition to abortion. The Biden administration argues it is ideological, but the anti-abortion
*07:19.140- 07:25.120* :  doctors and medical associations have put forward this argument, saying that they object to having
*07:25.120- 07:31.020* :  to treat women who might have taken the pill if she comes into an emergency room with medical
*07:31.020- 07:38.640* :  complications, and they think that the FDA overstepped and didn't appropriately approve regulations
*07:38.640- 07:47.120* :  when in 2016 and 2021, they actually expanded access to the abortion pill. They approved it to be
*07:47.120- 07:53.460* :  used and pregnancies up to 10 weeks instead of just seven weeks, and they also allowed the pill to
*07:53.460- 07:57.880* :  be sent through the post in the mail. These are some of the kind of the key arguments they've put
*07:57.880- 08:03.160* :  forward, but what the Biden administration said is that complications from mythopristone are
*08:03.160- 08:09.340* :  exceptionally rare, and it is a very safe drug, and that there's already federal protections in place
*08:09.340- 08:15.780* :  for any doctor who wants to opt out of caring for those types of patients. And the justices were
*08:15.780- 08:21.500* :  very skeptical that the anti-abortion groups even had standing to bring this lawsuit.
*08:21.820- 08:23.520* :  It's a pretty widely used drug, isn't it?
*08:24.120- 08:28.920* :  That's absolutely right. Just in the last year in the United States, medical abortions using
*08:28.920- 08:35.400* :  this drug, it's a part of a two-drug regimen, were used in 63 percent of all abortions.
*08:35.400- 08:40.920* :  Now that's up from 53 percent in 2020, and while several of the states that have
*08:40.940- 08:47.900* :  banned abortion have gone on to then try to ban telehealth appointments, which allow people to get
*08:47.900- 08:53.800* :  this pill through the mail, others haven't. And so for women in some of those states where abortion
*08:53.800- 09:00.280* :  is banned, they've also been able to use this. So many are hoping that the access remains in place
*09:00.280- 09:04.700* :  who are on the kind of reproductive right side, pro-abortion side of the debate.
*09:05.040- 09:10.020* :  Garouling, a decision is expected in June at the end of the Supreme Court term, but given
*09:10.020- 09:15.720* :  just how skeptical even the conservative justices were on this, saying essentially that this is
*09:15.720- 09:21.280* :  being brought forward by a handful of individuals that could impact the availability of this drug to
*09:21.280- 09:26.400* :  the whole nation's women, they seem skeptical that that was the right move for them to take.
*09:26.940- 09:33.020* :  Now the topic. For months, Israel has been defending itself against accusations of war crimes
*09:33.020- 09:39.500* :  and genocide as it wages its war against Hamas in Gaza. A day after the UN Security Council passed
*09:39.500- 09:45.420* :  a resolution calling for a ceasefire, the UN's special expert on the occupied Palestinian territories
*09:45.860- 09:50.140* :  Francesca Albanese said that Israel had perpetrated acts of genocide.
*09:50.820- 09:55.360* :  The denial of the reality and the continuation of Israel's impunity and exceptionalism
*09:55.860- 10:01.560* :  is no longer viable. Especially in light of yesterday's binding security council resolution,
*10:02.360- 10:09.260* :  I implore Member States to abide by their obligations, which start with imposing an arms embargo
*10:09.260- 10:16.040* :  and sanctions on Israel. And so ensure that the future does not continue to repeat itself.
*10:16.640- 10:23.500* :  Ms Albanese also called for Hamas to release all the hostages its holding. Israel insists that
*10:23.500- 10:28.900* :  Palestinian fighters are its enemy and not civilians. It labeled her report an obscene
*10:28.900- 10:34.440* :  inversion of reality as well as a distortion of the genocide convention. In northern Gaza,
*10:34.440- 10:38.980* :  civilians are so desperate for food that some have died chasing aid, which had been dropped
*10:38.980- 10:45.160* :  from the air. Our correspondent in Jerusalem is Hugo Bashegger. Alex, local officials are saying
*10:45.160- 10:50.600* :  12 people drowned as they tried to collect aid from the sea. And we've seen video of the
*10:50.600- 10:56.020* :  air drop with crowds of people running towards the beach. Then people were standing deep in water
*10:56.020- 11:02.160* :  and then bodies were being brought back to the beach. This happened in Bait Lahir, an area of
*11:02.160- 11:07.840* :  Gaza where there have been warnings that famine is imminent. If more humanitarian aid doesn't
*11:07.840- 11:13.100* :  get in, there have been reports of people dying of starvation, of patients dying in hospitals,
*11:13.100- 11:18.080* :  because doctors are unable to treat those people because they don't have basic supplies. So this
*11:18.080- 11:24.660* :  shows a situation that the UN has described as catastrophic. Hamas has called for American aid
*11:24.660- 11:29.620* :  drops to end, but the US as they will continue, given that people are dying trying to get supplies,
*11:29.620- 11:34.700* :  is it worth carrying on? There's very little aid going in by road, so given how desperate the
*11:34.700- 11:40.260* :  situation is, anything helps, but it's not ideal. And I think everybody knows it. Israel is under
*11:40.260- 11:45.480* :  a lot of international pressure to do more to allow aid into Gaza and also to help in the
*11:45.480- 11:51.060* :  distribution of this aid. Just days ago, it was on the Egyptian side of the Rafa crossing with
*11:51.060- 11:56.460* :  the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who essentially said that the obstacles that had been
*11:56.460- 12:02.500* :  created by Israel in the inspection and distribution of aid were part of the country strategy in
*12:02.500- 12:08.720* :  this war. And UN officials told me that more than 1500 trucks with aid were waiting to be allowed
*12:08.720- 12:14.940* :  by Israel to enter Gaza. The Israelis have dismissed this criticism, but this growing frustrations,
*12:14.940- 12:20.640* :  spatially in the US, which is Israel's closest ally, the way Israel has been conducting this war.
*12:21.060- 12:26.780* :  You go, Bashayya. As the conflict rages on, growing numbers of struggling Palestinian Christians
*12:26.780- 12:32.940* :  are leaving the West Bank. Israel has revoked permits for more than 150,000 workers from the West
*12:32.940- 12:38.640* :  Bank since the conflict began last October. The drop in tourists visiting the Holy Land has also
*12:38.640- 12:46.220* :  hit local communities as the BBC's Sarah Maneta reports. The sound of the bells of the
*12:46.220- 12:53.360* :  Nativity Church in Bethlehem brings out across a deserted square. The streets once brimming with tourists
*12:53.360- 13:02.500* :  and pilgrims, now are mostly empty and silent. 80% of the local population in Bethlehem depend on
*13:02.520- 13:11.660* :  tourism. Since October 7, everything stopped. People are out of their jobs. Facilities are closed.
*13:12.220- 13:18.300* :  Laila Aspura has been working in tourism for almost 20 years. She is an active member of the
*13:18.300- 13:24.400* :  local Christian community, and as many people who have lost their jobs are now cutting down on food
*13:24.400- 13:32.020* :  and other basic goods to make ends meet. Some families really are very much in need. Many of them
*13:33.020- 13:40.080* :  already left the country. The other, they are living here depending on the churches aid or the
*13:40.080- 13:47.680* :  organization aid. Have you considered living? Seriously? At some point? Yes. I will not do it. I love
*13:47.680- 13:53.740* :  my country. I have my family here, but we are thinking how long we can, we can survive.
*13:53.740- 14:01.800* :  And the biggest question is, do our children remain? Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, tourists
*14:01.800- 14:07.360* :  have stopped coming here. The traditional Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem were cancelled,
*14:07.360- 14:14.560* :  and if the war continues, so will the Easter ones. After Hamas's attack, Israel rebuked permits
*14:14.560- 14:20.920* :  for over 150,000 Palestinian workers from the West Bank. For over five months now, they
*14:20.920- 14:26.020* :  haven't received any income. So those who can afford it are looking for a way out.
*14:26.020- 14:33.980* :  We have at least 50 families in the last five months who left, and we have also many
*14:33.980- 14:39.100* :  Christian families who opted at the very beginning of the war to live. Father Fadi Diab
*14:39.100- 14:47.040* :  is an Anglican priest from Ramallah. It's sad to think of the whole land as a tourist site where
*14:47.040- 14:52.500* :  people would come from around the world to see him to churches without, you know, a community.
*14:52.540- 14:58.840* :  When I meet him here in London, he is trying to raise awareness about the difficulties his community
*14:58.840- 15:05.160* :  and Palestinians in the West Bank in general are facing. What we need is tangible actions on the ground.
*15:05.480- 15:10.940* :  We want the British government to put pressure on the Israeli government to remove the
*15:10.940- 15:16.480* :  cheek points, to allow people to reach their, you know, places of work, to allow, you know,
*15:16.480- 15:22.220* :  humanitarian aid to come in. These actions, what makes difference for the community only ground.
*15:22.760- 15:27.540* :  He believes only through diplomacy and with the involvement of the international community,
*15:27.660- 15:36.220* :  peace could return to the holy land. Sarah Maneta, the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange faces
*15:36.220- 15:41.060* :  a further way to find out whether he'll be able to appeal against his extradition to the United
*15:41.060- 15:47.000* :  States on charges relating to the publication of sensitive intelligence. Judges in Britain have
*15:47.000- 15:51.640* :  delayed their decision until the 20th of May as they seek assurances from the United States,
*15:51.640- 15:57.500* :  particularly over the use of the death penalty. Mr Assange has been in a British prison since 2019.
*15:57.500- 16:04.000* :  He's wanted by the US for disclosing secret military files. Mr Assange's wife Stella told
*16:04.000- 16:11.740* :  my colleague Evan Davis what she made of the judgment. It's a bizarre turn of events. I had expected
*16:11.740- 16:18.200* :  the court to allow evidence to be heard in relation to the murder plot against Julian,
*16:18.220- 16:25.460* :  but that was discarded. What the British courts have allowed is a provisional permission to appeal
*16:25.460- 16:31.620* :  three fundamental points in relation to the death penalty, another in relation to discriminating
*16:31.620- 16:37.920* :  against Julian for his nationality, and the argument put forward by the US government is that he does not
*16:37.920- 16:42.900* :  enjoy constitutional protections in relation to freedom of speech because he's Australian,
*16:42.900- 16:49.560* :  and the fundamental issue of bringing criminal charges against him for polishing true information.
*16:50.220- 16:54.380* :  The Americans have three weeks to answer those points and say, look, we're not contemplating the
*16:54.380- 17:00.080* :  death penalty and we won't discriminate. One might imagine those points can be dealt with very
*17:00.080- 17:04.460* :  quickly by the Americans. I wonder whether that then puts an end to the legal process.
*17:05.060- 17:14.940* :  Well, I'm not sure that's true. What the UK is asking the US to do is to contradict its submissions
*17:15.120- 17:21.280* :  that have been made under oath, and the British courts have identified legal problems and have
*17:21.280- 17:27.400* :  asked the US government to issue assurances to find a political solution to a legal problem.
*17:27.940- 17:35.320* :  This is similar to what happened the last time round where assurances resolved the problem
*17:35.320- 17:41.620* :  in relation to his treatment, and of course assurances are not binding. They're not enforceable,
*17:41.620- 17:46.240* :  and they're not worse the paper that they are written on. Now, it's done. Are you seriously thinking
*17:46.240- 17:51.000* :  that the death penalty was on the cards? Judicial death penalty was on the cards.
*17:51.180- 17:57.540* :  That is what the British courts have identified as a possibility. That is why they've asked the US
*17:57.580- 18:03.940* :  to issue so-called assurances, but this case is an embarrassment. It should never have been brought.
*18:03.940- 18:08.980* :  Julian should not have spent a single day in prison, and I think this becomes more and more evident
*18:08.980- 18:15.360* :  as time goes by. He was arrested in 2019. He has been in a high security prison without conviction.
*18:15.720- 18:22.540* :  Awaiting the outcome of this outrageous extradition case, which is an abuse weaponization
*18:22.900- 18:26.840* :  of a criminal justice system in the US to punish him for his political opinions,
*18:26.860- 18:31.960* :  for exposing the war crimes of the United States. The takeaway from the decision today
*18:31.960- 18:37.560* :  is that the US government should revisit this case, which was brought by the Trump administration,
*18:37.560- 18:42.640* :  which is an attack on press freedom, which puts journalists all over the world in jeopardy,
*18:42.640- 18:47.820* :  normalises in prisoning journalists, and to drop it entirely. The thing that the Biden administration
*18:47.820- 18:53.660* :  should have done from day one, anything else is going to leave a precedent that will be used
*18:53.660- 18:59.720* :  against the rest of the press, which criminalises publishing the truth. Stella Assange speaking to
*18:59.720- 19:07.080* :  Evan Davis. The Javan Tiger was thought to have been made extinct back in the 1980s by Hunters,
*19:07.260- 19:13.600* :  but now the authorities in Indonesia have begun a search for evidence that it may actually still
*19:13.600- 19:20.060* :  exist in the wild. Here's our Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Hatten. The investigation was launched
*19:20.060- 19:27.300* :  after scientists discovered genetic traces of a Javan Tiger on a single hair found near a village
*19:27.300- 19:34.860* :  in Western Java in 2019. At the time, a villager had spotted what he thought was a Javan Tiger with
*19:34.860- 19:41.580* :  its distinctive long-nero face jumping from a fence. The hair was later found on the fence
*19:41.900- 19:48.400* :  and large paw prints and claw marks beneath. DNA testing showed the hair matched a sample
*19:48.400- 19:56.240* :  from a Javan Tiger dating from 1930. Conservationists will now use camera traps on Java Island
*19:56.240- 20:02.180* :  in hopes of confirming the Javan Tiger's survival, though they also expressed worries but
*20:02.180- 20:07.600* :  publicising their search for fear it would attract Hunters. Celia Hatten
*20:09.860- 20:15.580* :  Still to come in the Global News podcast. The fastest growing economy in the world,
*20:15.580- 20:22.860* :  no sign here of the government or its main partner Exxon transitioning away from fossil fuels.
*20:23.420- 20:26.460* :  We have a special report from Guyana in South America.
*20:33.780- 20:39.020* :  Shares in Donald Trump's media company have soared as the firm makes its formal debut
*20:39.360- 20:44.080* :  on the Nasdaq stock market. The value of shares in the firm which owns the platform truth
*20:44.080- 20:50.940* :  social jumped to around $75 in early trading, although they later fell back. Mr Trump launched
*20:50.940- 20:56.200* :  truth social in response to being removed from mainstream platforms after his supporters
*20:56.700- 21:03.060* :  attacked the US Capitol on the 6th of January in 2021. Our correspondent in New York Michelle
*21:03.060- 21:09.660* :  Flarey reports. Donald Trump has just become a lot wealthier, at least on paper. Shares in
*21:09.660- 21:15.540* :  the parent company of truth social jumped by as much as 55% on its first day of trading as a public
*21:15.540- 21:21.700* :  company. Despite losing money, Trump media and technology group has captured the public's attention
*21:21.700- 21:26.360* :  with some buying up shares in the company to express their support for the form of president.
*21:27.320- 21:31.820* :  Mr Trump, who is the majority owner, now has a stake valued at more than $5 billion.
*21:32.140- 21:37.680* :  He could sell some of his stock to help pay for his mounting legal bills as he faces both civil
*21:37.680- 21:43.620* :  and criminal proceedings. Although he will have to wait. Without a waiver from the board he's
*21:43.620- 21:50.120* :  borne from selling his shares for six months. Trading under the ticker symbol DJT, his initials,
*21:50.340- 21:55.800* :  Mr Trump is once again overseeing a publicly traded company. Michelle Flarey,
*21:56.680- 22:01.820* :  thousands of demonstrators have gathered in Budapest after a former insider in the Hungarian
*22:01.820- 22:07.420* :  government released an audio recording that he says proves that top officials conspired to cover
*22:07.420- 22:13.120* :  up corruption. Peter Magyar has called for the government to resign. The government says there's
*22:13.120- 22:23.600* :  no case to answer. Our central Europe correspondent Nick Thorpe has the details. Peter Magyar led a
*22:23.600- 22:29.080* :  noisy but peaceful crowd of several thousand protesters from the city court to Parliament.
*22:29.840- 22:34.820* :  Earlier in the day, the 43-year-old lawyer was called to the Budapest Prosecutor's office
*22:34.820- 22:39.900* :  to submit evidence in an ongoing corruption trial. He claims the government
*22:39.900- 22:44.960* :  tampered with evidence to limit the damage to its senior officials in the case.
*22:45.800- 22:51.680* :  Government officials deny any wrongdoing and dismiss him as a would-be politician trying to
*22:51.680- 22:56.380* :  drum up support for a new centrist opposition party. Nick Thorpe.
*22:57.380- 23:02.260* :  Venezuela's neighbour Guyana is transforming itself into one of the world's biggest producers
*23:02.260- 23:08.640* :  of offshore oil and gas, even as the World Meteorological Organization issues a red alert about
*23:08.640- 23:15.080* :  the speed and scale of global warming. Exxonmobil is pumping more than 600,000 barrels a day
*23:15.080- 23:20.800* :  from reservoirs 150 kilometers off the coast. The vast fossil fuel reserves have prompted
*23:20.800- 23:27.000* :  Caracas to revive a claim to much of Guyana's territory. Steven Saka reports from the Guyani's
*23:27.000- 23:35.800* :  capital Georgetown. In Georgetown's oil industry supply base, it's boom time. Guyana is now a
*23:35.800- 23:42.420* :  petro-state, the fastest growing economy in the world. No sign here of the government or its
*23:42.420- 23:49.860* :  main partner Exxon transitioning away from fossil fuels. What we see is a world that still needs
*23:49.860- 23:57.060* :  dependable, secure energy supply. Alistair Routledge is president of Exxon Guyana.
*23:57.340- 24:04.000* :  We can't fail in our duty to deliver what modern society needs, but we can do it while reducing
*24:04.000- 24:10.160* :  emissions. It's a pathway you don't get there overnight and we can't meet the needs of society
*24:10.160- 24:17.740* :  today if we just turn the lights off. Guyana's Republic Day, a mood of defiance in the air.
*24:17.740- 24:24.660* :  Since Guyana discovered oil, neighbouring Venezuela has renewed an historic claim to a vast chunk
*24:24.700- 24:32.940* :  of Guyana's on and offshore territory. In response, Guyani's president Irfan Ali
*24:42.920- 24:49.420* :  sounds positively Churchillian. I am on the disputed border between Guyana and Venezuela.
*24:49.420- 24:55.880* :  It runs right across this river. It is quiet and it's calm here right now, but
*24:56.180- 25:01.720* :  further along the disputed border there are reports that Venezuela is building a new military
*25:01.720- 25:09.680* :  outpost. Venezuela's threats aren't the only challenge facing newly oil rich Guyana.
*25:11.180- 25:17.140* :  Most Guyani's people live below sea level, reliant on flood defences like the
*25:17.140- 25:24.560* :  aging seawall that protects Georgetown. The irony is obvious, Guyana is betting big on fossil fuels
*25:25.180- 25:31.900* :  just as decarbonisation is seen as ever more urgent to prevent rising sea levels.
*25:32.800- 25:38.300* :  Environmental activist Vandaratsik. It seems as if our authority is the powers that
*25:38.300- 25:46.940* :  be politically and otherwise. Our oblivious to Guyana and the Caribbean are one of the most vulnerable
*25:46.940- 25:53.620* :  places on the whole wide world and on planet Earth. We are plowing ahead with what is going to
*25:53.620- 26:02.140* :  be a massive impact negatively against climate change in the world. But Guyana's president Irfan Ali
*26:02.140- 26:09.260* :  isn't interested in climate lectures. Do you know that Guyana has a forest that is a size of
*26:09.260- 26:15.760* :  England and Scotland combined. A forest that stores 19.5 gigatons of carbon. A forest that we have
*26:15.760- 26:21.260* :  kept alive. Guess what? Even with our greatest exploration of the oil and gas resource we have now,
*26:21.480- 26:26.400* :  Guyana will still be net zero. We have to develop our country. We have to create the opportunity
*26:26.400- 26:33.480* :  for our people because no one is bringing that for us. 40% of Guyana's people live in poverty.
*26:33.980- 26:40.880* :  If the benefits of the oil rush reach them it'll feel like a blessing. But Guyana is navigating
*26:40.900- 26:47.940* :  a perilous course and there is no going back. Stephen Saka.
*26:49.280- 26:54.560* :  Is there anything more quintessentially German than a daxand? But Germany's version of the
*26:54.560- 26:59.560* :  Kennel Club argues that new animal welfare legislation could see Germans saying,
*26:59.560- 27:03.560* :  Alphidezane, to the sausage dog, Elebicinal reports.
*27:08.920- 27:13.740* :  With its short legs and long body, the Dachund is one of Germany's most beloved breeds.
*27:13.740- 27:19.880* :  Aber Einstein had his own puppy and there's even a museum dedicated to the sausage dog in Bavaria.
*27:20.400- 27:26.180* :  An avena dog called Valdi was the official mascot for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.
*27:31.780- 27:34.960* :  But Germany's National Kennel Club says the breed is under threat.
*27:34.960- 27:40.540* :  Under a new draft law that wants to clamp down on the unethical breeding practices that inflict
*27:40.540- 27:45.900* :  long-term suffering on animals. It takes stronger action against the illegal puppy trade,
*27:45.900- 27:50.680* :  but also outlines a ban on breeding dogs with skeletal abnormalities.
*27:50.700- 27:56.560* :  The Kennel Club argued that phrase is ambiguous and the Dachund could fall into the category.
*27:59.460- 28:04.700* :  Dachunds have short stubby legs as a result of a genetic condition called Condra Dysplasia,
*28:04.700- 28:08.780* :  which is a type of dwarfism. It makes them more prone to spinal problems,
*28:08.780- 28:13.680* :  which is why the U.S. Animal Welfare Organization, PISA or the PETA,
*28:13.680- 28:19.220* :  last year urged people not to buy them. However, Germany's Kennel Club President has
*28:19.220- 28:24.500* :  launched a petition in protest, so far collecting more than 12,000 signatures.
*28:25.200- 28:28.840* :  It says it can't imagine a Germany without sausages.
*28:32.620- 28:38.540* :  Elebicinal. We don't often offer gardening tips on this podcast, but
*28:39.220- 28:39.700* :  here's one.
*28:50.380- 28:55.880* :  Understand it unless you speak Korean. But behind the Korean, you may have picked up
*28:55.880- 29:01.880* :  someone speaking English. That was Alan Titchmarsh at one time, the best-known gardener
*29:02.080- 29:08.800* :  on British television. He is now a hit on North Korean State TV with his gardening secret series,
*29:09.040- 29:14.580* :  but even this deeply unthreatening broadcaster has proved too much for the communist
*29:14.580- 29:21.280* :  censors who have blurred his genes, a symbol of American imperialism, as far as Pyongyang is concerned.
*29:21.280- 29:27.400* :  Alistair Coleman from BBC Monitoring, who knows rather a lot about trousers in one of the world's
*29:27.400- 29:32.700* :  most secretive states, takes up the story. Well, North Korean television is a funny thing they
*29:32.700- 29:38.760* :  show very, very little phone content, and what they usually air from abroad is usually pirated,
*29:38.760- 29:44.420* :  such as sports, especially Premier League and Champions League football. About 10 years ago,
*29:44.420- 29:51.060* :  however, during one of the eras of approachment, the BBC and the phone office were looking to share
*29:51.060- 29:55.280* :  some pretty harmless programs with the North Koreans to see what they made of them.
*29:55.600- 29:58.840* :  I don't know what happened to that deal, but it would have thought that anything
*29:58.840- 30:02.320* :  with Alan Titchmarch would be seen as pretty much harmless.
*30:02.360- 30:06.260* :  Yeah, Alan Titchmarch, the nicest man, Britain's best-known gardener,
*30:06.720- 30:11.920* :  lets hear what he thinks about the fact that his genes have been blurred out.
*30:12.120- 30:20.080* :  It's taken me to reach the age of 74 to be regarded in the same sort of breath as Elvis Presley,
*30:20.480- 30:26.540* :  Tom Jones, Rod Stewart, wearing trousers that are generally considered by those of us
*30:26.800- 30:32.460* :  sensitive disposition to be rather too tight. I've never seen myself as a dangerous,
*30:33.140- 30:37.980* :  subversive imperialist. I'm generally regarded as rather cozy and pretty harmless, so
*30:38.260- 30:43.500* :  actually it's giving you a bit of street cred, really. Yeah. So, Halister, why were his
*30:43.500- 30:48.600* :  genes so sensitive? Well, it's pretty straightforward. North Korea is a very hardcore
*30:48.620- 30:54.920* :  communist state. We've drawn themselves from the rest of the world in the outside culture,
*30:55.500- 31:02.640* :  and blue genes to Kim Jong-il, back in the 90s, represented everything that was imperialistic
*31:02.640- 31:06.880* :  about the United States, and therefore no genes were allowed.
*31:07.340- 31:13.460* :  That's now been continued by his son, Kim Jong-un. You, of course, take a special interest
*31:14.180- 31:18.380* :  in trousers, in North Korea, so this story rather made it for you.
*31:18.520- 31:21.980* :  This has been my dream gig, to be honest, but for those that don't know,
*31:21.980- 31:29.760* :  I curate a hashtag on ex-Twitter called Kim Jong-un trouser watch, in which any time Kim Jong-un
*31:29.760- 31:36.300* :  appears in public, I will cast judgment on his trousers, usually because they are absolutely huge.
*31:36.480- 31:41.300* :  He really has got a thing about trousers, hasn't he? He does. The average North Korean wears a
*31:41.300- 31:48.200* :  textile called Vinalon, which is made out of coal and limestone, but I don't think that Mr. Kim
*31:48.200- 31:53.060* :  actually has any Vinalon clothes, or his, probably, the tailor-made for him.
*31:53.320- 31:55.840* :  Yes, and yes, he does like a roomy trouser.
*31:56.280- 31:57.120* :  Alistair Kelman.
*32:00.000- 32:05.400* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*32:05.400- 32:11.220* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.

*32:26.780- 32:30.200* :  Martin. I'm Alex Ritson, until next time, goodbye.

*33:14.380- 33:17.480* :  crow's feet, and forehead lines look better in adults.
*33:17.480- 33:22.220* :  Effects of Botox Cosmetic may spread hours to weeks after injection causing serious symptoms.
*33:22.220- 33:24.740* :  Alert your doctor right away as difficulty swallowing,
*33:24.740- 33:28.840* :  speaking, breathing, eye problems, or muscle weakness may be a sign of a life-threatening condition.
*33:29.120- 33:31.680* :  Patients with these conditions before injection are at highest risk.
*33:31.760- 33:34.240* :  Don't receive Botox Cosmetic if you have a skin infection.
*33:34.500- 33:37.460* :  Side effects may include allergic reactions, injection site pain, headache,
*33:37.460- 33:39.400* :  eyebrow and eyelid drooping and eyelid swelling.

*33:50.080- 33:53.800* :  including botulinum toxins, as these may increase the risk of serious side effects.
