*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:21.160* :  by advertising. Smart journalism. Fascinating topics. Words that describe CNN's podcast,
*00:21.160- 00:26.060* :  the assignment with Audi Cornish. Last year, the Army missed its recruitment goal.
*00:26.060- 00:32.980* :  It had 65,000 spots to fill and came up 10,000 short of that target. Why is it so hard to
*00:32.980- 00:39.100* :  recruit? How's the Pentagon responding? And how are the voices of service members on social media
*00:39.440- 00:44.040* :  shifting the balance? Listen to the assignment with Audi Cornish wherever you get your podcasts.
*00:49.680- 00:52.880* :  Hi, Namulanta Kumboh here with some very exciting news.
*00:53.380- 00:58.480* :  Dear daughter is back for a new series. I'm putting together a handbook to life for daughters
*00:58.980- 01:04.060* :  everywhere, full of stories and advice to help navigate life. That's Dear daughter from the BBC
*01:04.060- 01:10.280* :  World Service. Find it wherever you get your BBC podcast. This is the Global News Podcast from
*01:10.280- 01:18.460* :  the BBC World Service. Hello, I'm Nick Miles at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 21st of March. These
*01:18.460- 01:24.840* :  are our main stories. This fighting continues in Gaza and now Washington ramps up the search for
*01:24.840- 01:32.020* :  a ceasefire. The European Union looks set to crack down on unpaid internships and baseball's biggest
*01:32.020- 01:41.100* :  star is robbed allegedly by his interpreter. Also in this podcast. Do you believe the election was
*01:41.100- 01:49.900* :  free and fair? We believe that I think the most open and democratic elections in the bloody world.
*01:50.640- 01:54.780* :  Putin's people are in buoyant mood as the BBC goes inside the Kremlin.
*01:59.140- 02:05.100* :  Washington is Israel's staunchest ally. For months it's vetoed attempts at the UN to pass
*02:05.100- 02:11.660* :  resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. But now it's submitted a draft resolution to the UN
*02:11.660- 02:16.600* :  Security Council calling for an immediate ceasefire linked to the release of hostages.
*02:16.620- 02:22.660* :  The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is in Cairo for discussions with ministers from six
*02:22.660- 02:27.540* :  Arab states and the Palestinian Authority. I think that would send a strong message, a strong
*02:27.540- 02:33.080* :  signal. Of course we stand with Israel and it's right to defend itself to make sure that October 7th
*02:33.080- 02:42.800* :  never happens again. But at the same time it's imperative that the civilians who are in harm's
*02:42.800- 02:48.000* :  way that we make them a priority protecting the civilians, getting them humanitarian assistance.
*02:48.780- 02:53.540* :  Tom Bateman is our correspondent in Cairo traveling with Mr. Blinken and he gave me this assessment.
*02:53.980- 02:58.600* :  There's certainly been a gradual change of mood from Washington when it comes to the current
*02:58.600- 03:03.320* :  Israeli coalition and it's leader Benjamin Netanyahu. I mean they're distinctly unhappy about
*03:03.420- 03:10.840* :  several of the ways in which the war has been carried out and particularly the lack of humanitarian aid
*03:10.840- 03:16.520* :  getting into Gaza and the absolute crisis this is precipitated on the ground and also they want
*03:16.520- 03:22.840* :  to stop a full-scale military assault by the Israelis into the city of Raffa. As for the United
*03:22.840- 03:27.640* :  Nations Security Council resolution, the draft that the US has put forward has been circulated
*03:27.640- 03:32.380* :  for a couple of weeks now. What's new is it's looking like it's been submitted for the vote.
*03:32.380- 03:39.680* :  That vote could happen within the next days, possibly as early as tomorrow. But there is a new
*03:39.680- 03:44.780* :  want to anything that happens really at the UN when it involves the US. It's not the sort of primary
*03:44.780- 03:50.860* :  policy forum that it wants to achieve its objectives and this resolution does a couple of things.
*03:50.860- 03:57.560* :  Firstly, it has prevented or displaced a much stronger resolution that was submitted by the
*03:57.560- 04:03.340* :  Algerians that the Americans vetoed. Now that's simply called for an immediate humanitarian
*04:03.340- 04:10.120* :  ceasefire. So to stop the war in Gaza, the Americans vetoed that. So they've put this in its
*04:10.340- 04:16.200* :  place and it calls for an immediate ceasefire but it links that ceasefire to the release of hostages.
*04:16.200- 04:22.600* :  So it is a conditional ceasefire and the point is that exact arrangement is what is in the deal
*04:22.600- 04:28.120* :  being negotiated indirectly between Israel and Hamas at the moment in Qatar. So really the UN
*04:28.120- 04:32.240* :  Security Council resolution they're putting forward calls for exactly what is on the table
*04:32.880- 04:38.200* :  in the ceasefire discussion already. Now there isn't an imminent breakthrough on that but certainly
*04:38.200- 04:42.960* :  the Qataris are saying they are optimistic that they will reach agreement on that eventually.
*04:43.600- 04:50.740* :  Tom Bateman, now what does the word intern say to you? Perhaps young unpaid general office
*04:51.320- 04:56.260* :  dog's body perhaps who works long hours and is desperate to get a foothold in an organization.
*04:56.880- 05:02.740* :  Well the EU is planning to clamp down on this by introducing a proposal to stop unpaid internships
*05:02.740- 05:09.380* :  offered by unscrupulous employers. The BBC's Hannah Malayne is following the story and
*05:09.380- 05:15.160* :  going with the latest. So the EU commission have proposed a new package to improve the rights of
*05:15.160- 05:19.860* :  trainees by scrapping these unpaid internships. Alongside that they're going to guarantee
*05:20.060- 05:25.800* :  some new rules too on those internships which means they'll also get social benefits like sick pay
*05:25.800- 05:32.200* :  and be entitled to some leave and there's estimated a 3.1 million trainees in Europe at the moment
*05:32.200- 05:38.000* :  and half of those are currently unpaid. So this plan and new proposal will mean fairer opportunities
*05:38.000- 05:43.260* :  for young talent and that European countries will be able to retain that talent too and they'll
*05:43.260- 05:48.220* :  be less likely to look abroad for work. So it all sounds very positive, Nicholas Schmidt, the
*05:48.600- 05:53.640* :  EU Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights certainly think so saying that this move will stop young
*05:53.640- 05:59.560* :  people being exploited. But there has been plenty of criticism of this new proposal too. The European
*05:59.560- 06:05.060* :  trade union confederations said the language in the proposal was blurry and more needed to be done
*06:05.060- 06:09.980* :  to protect workers on internships. And a lot of that criticism is coming because the package only
*06:09.980- 06:14.720* :  protects workers and the definition of worker in this instance is someone that has completed
*06:14.720- 06:20.240* :  the education which means students who often take part in these internships positions are not
*06:20.240- 06:25.340* :  protected. And these new rules will also mean that there'll be rigorous inspection systems to
*06:25.340- 06:29.800* :  kind of crack down on these employers that are using young people in this way and it hasn't
*06:29.800- 06:34.480* :  been decided how that crack down would happen yet. Yeah it's going to be very complicated isn't it?
*06:34.480- 06:41.240* :  Very difficult to monitor thousands and thousands of different companies small and large across the
*06:41.240- 06:45.820* :  EU. There are always going to be people who are desperate enough to get experience and willing to
*06:45.820- 06:49.860* :  work for nothing aren't they? You're right it's hard to know how this is going to work and there
*06:49.860- 06:54.740* :  are always going to be people ready to take these opportunities according to the Euro-Berameter
*06:54.740- 07:01.200* :  Survey in 2023. Almost 80% of young Europeans had done one of these traineeships and almost 70%
*07:01.200- 07:06.100* :  of them said they got a job after that training stint so you can absolutely see why these opportunities
*07:06.100- 07:12.220* :  are so popular. The hope is that this will level the playing field and those more affluent people that
*07:12.220- 07:16.660* :  could take these jobs and are willing to work for free and it was had access to them those
*07:16.660- 07:21.160* :  opportunities would be open to everybody and they'll know that they'll be fairly paid. It could be
*07:21.160- 07:24.880* :  a while though before we see any of these changes coming in the EU system for bringing in these
*07:24.880- 07:30.680* :  proposals is complicated member states and MEPs will pick apart these rules before deciding on
*07:30.680- 07:36.960* :  an agreement so it's unlikely to be plain sailing. Hannah Malaine. Haiti is in the
*07:36.960- 07:42.760* :  throws of a desperate humanitarian crisis. The UN says many many people there are suffering
*07:42.760- 07:48.520* :  from serious hunger and manutrition. Well the head of UNICEF Catherine Russell has said the UN
*07:48.520- 07:53.120* :  just can't get enough aid into the country and that is largely because the gang's control most
*07:53.120- 07:58.320* :  of the capital including its main port. Our Central America and Caribbean correspondent
*07:58.320- 08:03.320* :  Will Grad reports from the north of the country. To describe some of the living conditions in
*08:03.320- 08:08.780* :  Porto Prince's precarious is an understatement but the group of around a hundred displaced families
*08:08.780- 08:17.000* :  taking refuge inside an abandoned cinema have it particularly tar. Among them is Sarah Malaine,
*08:17.480- 08:22.100* :  a 20-year-old computer science student. She and her family had to flee their home because of gang
*08:22.100- 08:28.240* :  violence. Now she lives in the temporary camp under tar Paulins with no sewage system or running
*08:28.240- 08:38.360* :  water and on some day she says the family doesn't eat at all. I go to school with no food,
*08:38.360- 08:42.720* :  spend the day hungry and then go to bed still with nothing in my stomach she says.
*08:43.560- 08:48.380* :  Now she sees no other choice but to completely abandon her studies. While the daily struggle to
*08:48.380- 08:52.840* :  find enough food is nothing new in Haiti the difference now is the scale of the emergency
*08:52.840- 08:58.160* :  and food insecurity. Potentially millions of people are at risk of falling into malnutrition
*08:58.200- 09:03.500* :  and already don't know where or when their next meal is coming from. There are a handful of success
*09:03.500- 09:10.060* :  stories. Jen Shank is co-founder of Second Mile and otherwise fully Haitian-run maternity NGO
*09:10.060- 09:17.500* :  and malnutrition centre. So we we have 11 rooms so we can take up to 22 families so one caregiver
*09:17.500- 09:23.240* :  in child that's severely malnourished. As she showed me around we met Cecilina Joseph,
*09:23.240- 09:29.600* :  a six-month-old baby who was dangerously malnourished a few weeks ago. The organisation was able to
*09:29.600- 09:35.380* :  hospitalise him and now thankfully he's putting on weight. Others typically spend four weeks at
*09:35.380- 09:40.700* :  the residential centre receiving care and support for their malnourished children. Their success rate
*09:40.700- 09:46.220* :  is high just 1% of children who leave their programme are later re-admitted for malnutrition
*09:46.220- 09:52.880* :  also via hunger. Under the corrugated iron roof of an outside classroom about a dozen women
*09:52.880- 10:00.000* :  are sitting with their babies lying on blankets on the floor receiving instruction and nutrition
*10:00.160- 10:07.280* :  about how to prepare simple foods how to deal with the signs of malnutrition. What to do if your
*10:07.280- 10:14.900* :  baby has diarrhea all sorts of important lessons which in the current crisis are applicable to
*10:15.020- 10:20.760* :  millions of families in Haiti. With AIDS still barely making it into Haiti the organisation has
*10:20.760- 10:26.620* :  stocked up on emergency supplies but co-founder Jen Shanks says she fears the mistakes of the
*10:26.620- 10:33.320* :  disaster response to the 2010 earthquake could be repeated in this crisis. A lot of these larger
*10:33.380- 10:39.440* :  NGOs flying and fly out and they're handed all of these supplies and all of these aid and
*10:40.900- 10:46.240* :  and suddenly all of these funds to now hire all these people you're actually hiring from all
*10:46.240- 10:54.480* :  of these local NGOs when you could just help you know pay their staff members and help you know
*10:54.480- 11:01.160* :  and give them the aid to distribute I think that's critical. Climate change has meant crops often
*11:01.160- 11:07.400* :  yield poor harvests or fail altogether. Few know that better than farmer or dear Leong who has
*11:07.400- 11:17.920* :  six children to feed. His maize and beans plants are struggling to survive without proper irrigation
*11:17.920- 11:23.980* :  he says and there is a severe local water shortage which has been going on for months. As Haiti
*11:23.980- 11:29.300* :  unravels or deal must continue to try to scratch and living out of the land yet rather than a
*11:29.300- 11:34.840* :  temporary crisis which can be solved by aid alone severe hunger is now becoming the norm for so
*11:34.840- 11:40.380* :  many here another tragic part of this country's dire new reality. Will Grant.
*11:41.820- 11:47.340* :  Russia's president Putin has gathered his celebrity supporters for a lavish event in Moscow
*11:47.780- 11:52.480* :  as after winning his fifth term as president of the weekend. It was an election that western leaders
*11:52.480- 11:58.260* :  have called neither free nor fair. The BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg got a rare invitation
*11:58.260- 12:03.680* :  to the Kremlin. They say location is everything if you want to impress.
*12:11.120- 12:17.660* :  So Vladimir Putin invited his celebrity supporters to one of the swankiest parts of the Kremlin.
*12:20.960- 12:27.520* :  Pop stars actors film directors and decorated servicemen applauded as the president entered
*12:27.520- 12:35.640* :  St. Andrews Hall with its giant chandeliers gold trimmed columns and the coronation throes of
*12:35.640- 12:46.420* :  the Russian tsars. President Putin thanked the VIPs for their support during the election campaign
*12:46.460- 12:54.320* :  and for helping him get re-elected with 87% of the vote. A vote that western leaders have
*12:54.320- 13:03.620* :  dismissed as a total sham. In it Mr. Putin faced no serious challenger. We too were in St. Andrews Hall
*13:04.100- 13:10.300* :  having received a rare invitation to the Kremlin palace, a sign perhaps of Vladimir Putin's
*13:10.300- 13:16.760* :  growing confidence. But how would his supporters here respond to criticisms of the election?
*13:17.560- 13:23.740* :  I spoke first to film director Andrei Kunchellovsky. Do you believe the election was free and fair?
*13:25.820- 13:32.800* :  We created the most open and democratic elections in the bloody world.
*13:33.380- 13:41.380* :  In what way was it open and democratic? Because everyone can vote openly and you can see
*13:41.420- 13:48.800* :  how the result. Nothing else. Then I asked Margareta Simanyan, editor-in-chief of state
*13:48.800- 13:55.300* :  broadcaster RT with a she thought this had been a democratic election. Do you believe the election
*13:55.300- 14:00.440* :  was free and fair? Come on. You don't? No, do you believe it was? Don't you tell me you don't?
*14:00.440- 14:06.100* :  You live in Russia. You see that everyone supports Putin. Everyone? Five, six years ago,
*14:06.100- 14:11.160* :  and you a lot of people who didn't. Now, me personally, I don't know anyone. Was the
*14:11.160- 14:18.480* :  resurious challenger in the election a serious opponent? Is there a need for a serious opponent?
*14:19.540- 14:26.640* :  Why? Why is there no need for a serious opponent? Why do you always think that the way you live
*14:26.640- 14:32.080* :  is better than the way we live? You know better. Not at all. Yes you do. Why do you think there's...
*14:32.080- 14:39.600* :  Even the way you ask questions you do. Why don't you guys do the way we do it? Because we're not
*14:39.600- 14:49.440* :  you and we don't like you much really. Was I offended? No. Surprised? No. Was I persuaded that Russia's
*14:49.440- 14:56.120* :  election had indeed been a level playing field and a victory for democracy? Once again, no.
*14:57.100- 15:03.200* :  But the Kremlin will pay no attention to Western criticism. It will portray Vladimir Putin as
*15:03.200- 15:12.460* :  a leader loved and trusted by his people. And Mr. Putin will use his 87% landslide as a mandate
*15:12.460- 15:17.640* :  for whatever action he decides to take next. Steve Rosenberg
*15:19.140- 15:24.140* :  Now the Japanese baseball player, Shohe Otani is one of the biggest names in the sport.
*15:24.140- 15:29.120* :  He's an all-rounder for the Los Angeles Dodgers, but his batting and pitching is,
*15:29.700- 15:34.140* :  it's safe to say, more fluent than his English. So he often has to rely on his interpreter
*15:34.140- 15:40.820* :  to get his message across to the American media. Now though, his interpreter, Ipe Mitohara,
*15:41.600- 15:46.960* :  has been sacked after being accused of stealing millions of dollars from him. Our correspondent,
*15:46.960- 15:52.840* :  Sharma Khalil, is in Tokyo. We understand that these allegations are of massive theft. That's how
*15:52.840- 15:57.160* :  they've been described and they're connected to illegal gambling. According to the U.S. Sports
*15:57.160- 16:03.980* :  Network ESPN, four and a half million dollars were transferred from Shohe Otani's account to
*16:03.980- 16:10.720* :  a bookmaker. ESPN also said that it reviewed bank information with Otani's name on two
*16:11.100- 16:16.620* :  half a million dollar payments to a bookmaking operation run by someone who'd been reportedly
*16:16.620- 16:22.580* :  investigated for illegal sports battling. But even though Otani's name is on the paperwork,
*16:22.580- 16:28.580* :  if you will, we know for a fact that he himself is not accused of any wrongdoing. We know that his
*16:28.580- 16:35.960* :  interpreter, his long companion, Ipe Mitohara, has spoken to ESPN. The problem is that his account
*16:35.960- 16:40.880* :  of what happened has been quite murky. In an interview, he told the network that he'd asked
*16:40.880- 16:45.960* :  the baseball star to help him cover his gambling debts. And then he changed his story,
*16:45.960- 16:49.920* :  saying that Shohe Otani didn't know about the issue, didn't know about his gambling debts,
*16:50.420- 16:56.160* :  and did not transfer any money. So how he managed to make those transfers, how he managed to steal,
*16:56.160- 17:02.300* :  or allegedly steal this amount of money, that's still being researched at the moment and being
*17:02.300- 17:08.160* :  investigated. One of the spokespeople of the team of the LA Dodgers has spoken to the BBC,
*17:08.840- 17:13.560* :  and they said that they're gathering information, but confirmed that the interpreter had been sacked.
*17:13.560- 17:18.300* :  But this is of course huge news, not just because of how big and popular baseball is,
*17:18.300- 17:23.680* :  it is because this is a man that's very closely connected to Shohe Otani, and there just isn't
*17:23.680- 17:29.580* :  a bigger name, not just in Japanese sport, but in Japanese pop culture in general, than Shohe Otani
*17:29.580- 17:39.120* :  at the moment. Shohe Cleal. Still to come in this podcast. I do hope that visitors can come now,
*17:39.120- 17:44.500* :  and that they will have the interest in learning more about Pikmin hippos, and also seeing our little
*17:44.500- 17:50.480* :  baby boy as well. I hope they are as excited as we are about this little one. Why there's so much
*17:50.480- 18:01.420* :  excitement around this new born baby. Where to be a woman is the podcast celebrating the best of

*19:33.280- 19:36.900* :  Words that describes CNN's podcast, The Assignment with Audi Cornish.
*19:37.240- 19:43.100* :  Last year, the Army missed its recruitment goal. It had 65,000 spots to fill and came up
*19:43.100- 19:48.780* :  10,000 short of that target. Why is it so hard to recruit? How's the Pentagon responding?
*19:49.300- 19:54.040* :  And how are the voices of service members on social media shifting the balance?
*19:54.540- 19:57.860* :  Listen to The Assignment with Audi Cornish wherever you get your podcasts.
*20:05.420- 20:09.200* :  We've talked a lot recently about the new wave of space exploration.
*20:09.560- 20:15.500* :  Unmanned landings on the moon, giant rocket launches that could take astronaut there and beyond.
*20:16.480- 20:21.040* :  But here's something that will enable everyone to enjoy the wonders of earth from space.
*20:21.700- 20:27.120* :  A British company, Sen, is sending high-definition cameras up to the international space station.
*20:27.520- 20:32.600* :  There will livestream high-quality pictures of earth back to earth that you can see on a laptop
*20:32.600- 20:37.760* :  or a smartphone. Tells Black is the founder and boss of Sen, and he told Johnny Diamond what
*20:37.760- 20:43.740* :  high-definition views people can expect to see. One camera is a wide-angle panoramic view which
*20:43.740- 20:48.260* :  we'll look at, a sort of 1,000 kilometer scene across the horizon, so you're really going to see
*20:48.260- 20:54.300* :  the curvature of the earth. And then the camera looking down is looking at a scene about 250
*20:54.300- 20:59.800* :  kilometers by 150 kilometers. So it's really focusing on the environment and geography.
*20:59.800- 21:04.460* :  So you're seeing rivers and mountain ranges and you will see cities as well.
*21:04.780- 21:10.220* :  A lot of these space missions are strike most people as fairly elite projects.
*21:10.220- 21:15.920* :  You are in some small way trying to give them back to everyone.
*21:16.280- 21:22.460* :  Yes, that's right. Satellites traditionally have been used to capture imagery for governments
*21:22.460- 21:28.460* :  and for scientists and all that's really important. And what we want to do is capture imagery and
*21:28.460- 21:33.740* :  make it accessible to everyone because we want to, if we can, try and give people everyone,
*21:33.820- 21:40.080* :  similar views of the planet that astronauts get and there's about 600 astronauts that have
*21:40.080- 21:45.640* :  gone to space and they all look down at earth and say it gives them this overview effect,
*21:45.640- 21:50.660* :  this cognitive shift. It changes the way you think about the planet. You see the delicate,
*21:50.660- 21:56.420* :  thin blue atmosphere protecting us and seeing the environmental events and how the planet is
*21:56.420- 22:02.300* :  changing every day. It's a living breathing world and there's eight billion of us on it.
*22:02.460- 22:07.500* :  And you know, we want to look after it and see its beauty. And in the same way that
*22:08.200- 22:13.400* :  Google gives everyone access to, if you like, every fact in human history, what we want to do is
*22:13.660- 22:18.300* :  create a real-time data set about what's happening now, what's unfolding now. And the data,
*22:19.080- 22:23.960* :  as well as providing beautiful imagery also serves an important purpose of helping people,
*22:23.960- 22:28.180* :  whether that's emergency responders to environmental events, for example,
*22:29.060- 22:34.420* :  monitoring climate change and really using the storytelling power of video to tell a story
*22:34.420- 22:40.040* :  about planetary change. Charles Black there. Another row has broken out between
*22:40.040- 22:46.100* :  Mexico and the United States over the issue of migration. Mexico has criticized a proposed
*22:46.280- 22:52.700* :  new Texas immigration law allowing officials to detain and prosecute people they think have entered
*22:52.700- 22:57.720* :  the US illegally. Well, thousands of migrants tried across into the US from Mexico every year,
*22:58.300- 23:03.120* :  but with organized crime groups increasing their control of the routes, it's a treacherous journey.
*23:03.540- 23:06.920* :  Linda Presley has been to the Mexican border city of Tijuana.
*23:07.440- 23:15.840* :  The messy city of Tijuana is located on Mexico's border with the United States and it's built
*23:15.840- 23:22.380* :  across a series of deep ravines. Well on the outskirts of the city, where the hills get high,
*23:23.580- 23:34.500* :  ahead of us, maybe 20 people, sturdy shoes, spades, picks. This is one of Mexico's
*23:35.700- 23:43.380* :  many groups of people made up of families with the disappeared and they go out together
*23:44.660- 23:50.480* :  looking for the bodies of their loved ones. Eddie Carillo who leads this group has got his phone out
*23:50.480- 23:59.400* :  taking pictures. Eddie tells us that over four years they found around 40 or 50 bodies here.
*24:00.360- 24:05.060* :  Eddie's still looking for the remains of his teenage son, Eric, who disappeared five years ago
*24:05.060- 24:12.420* :  after a night out in Tijuana. Over 100,000 Mexicans are registered as missing, victims of the drug war,
*24:12.580- 24:19.500* :  impunity and the proliferation of armed criminal groups. Now migrants have fallen prey to the men with
*24:19.500- 24:28.180* :  guns too. He says that often migrants attempt to cross the border here to the US without
*24:28.180- 24:33.880* :  paying a coyote or guide. When they don't pay whoever has control of the area, that's when they
*24:33.880- 24:38.880* :  may be detained. Eddie thinks that's what happened to a group whose remains he found nearby.
*24:42.000- 24:46.560* :  There were five bodies, he says. Three were together and another two separated from the group.
*24:46.820- 24:54.600* :  Four men and one woman all shot in the head, execution star. I call them narco coyotes because
*24:54.600- 25:00.920* :  they not only cross people, they also cross drugs. So it's a new type of human, it's milder.
*25:01.560- 25:07.320* :  Dr. Victor Clark Alfaro lives in Tijuana and is a professor at San Diego State University in the US,
*25:07.340- 25:13.520* :  an expert on the cartels and the shifting pattern of migration across the Mexico-US border.
*25:14.160- 25:19.060* :  When I began studying migration at the end of the 80s, there were three countries coming to Tijuana,
*25:19.060- 25:26.200* :  coming to the border. Nowadays, there are 120 different countries, different nationalities.
*25:26.200- 25:31.640* :  Different nationalities are coming to Tijuana. Tijuana is one of Mexico's most brutal cities,
*25:32.200- 25:37.460* :  murders and everyday event. And the shelters where migrants stay before they attempt to cross the
*25:37.460- 25:42.520* :  border have become vulnerable to attacks too. There have been reports of armed men opening
*25:42.520- 25:48.020* :  fire on one of them, residents being extorted at another, and one refuge receiving threats to
*26:09.640- 26:17.140* :  burn down its facilities. In my town there's lots of drugs trafficking, drugs, many things. My
*26:17.140- 26:22.680* :  husband got involved with a married woman from a bad crowd. And when they found out about the
*26:22.680- 26:28.320* :  affair, they said they were going to get revenge on me because I was his wife. I left that same day,
*26:28.320- 26:35.500* :  I was afraid and I just left. In the refuge Jessica's feeling safe, she's waiting for an appointment
*26:35.500- 26:41.680* :  with a US border authorities. She wants to enter the US legally so she doesn't have to pay her coyote
*26:41.680- 26:47.360* :  to your people smuggler. But make no mistake, migrants in Mexico have become fair game for
*26:47.360- 26:54.380* :  organized crime. Linda Pressley, working in extreme heat can double the risk of stillbirth
*26:54.380- 26:58.300* :  and miscarriage for pregnant women. That's according to new research from India.
*26:58.700- 27:03.820* :  The study found that the risks to mothers to be are significantly higher than previously thought.
*27:04.280- 27:08.320* :  Researchers say hotter summers can affect not only women in tropical climates but also in
*27:08.320- 27:13.780* :  countries like the UK and other parts of Western Europe. It comes as the World Health Organization
*27:13.780- 27:19.240* :  warns that pregnant women and babies face some of the gravest consequences of all as a result of
*27:19.240- 27:25.000* :  climate change. Professor Jane Hurst of the George Institute for Global Health, one of the authors
*27:25.000- 27:30.920* :  of the study, is in Chennai in India. She explained a bit more about what she found out to my colleague,
*27:30.920- 27:37.620* :  Devina Gupta. Basically what the research has shown is that there was a doubling of the risk of
*27:37.620- 27:43.460* :  miscarriage and stillbirth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and low
*27:43.460- 27:50.000* :  birth weight in those workers in India who were exposed to very high heat during their workplace
*27:50.000- 27:55.980* :  during the pregnancy. This is concerning because whilst there's evidence emerging from other centres
*27:55.980- 28:01.680* :  around the world of an increase in these risks with heat exposure, the level of risk seems to be
*28:01.680- 28:06.640* :  much higher in this group in India and that may be to do with some other exposures that they have
*28:06.640- 28:12.360* :  such as socioeconomic stat factors and air pollution and other things but we really don't know yet.
*28:12.360- 28:17.500* :  So we're currently trying to explore this in another large study trying to answer some of those
*28:17.820- 28:22.460* :  questions as to why this is happening to this group of women and really working out what can be
*28:22.460- 28:28.160* :  done to prevent it. Just to point out the sample size that you've taken were of women who are
*28:28.440- 28:33.980* :  from the poor strata of the society. The socio-economically levels are such that they have to do certain
*28:33.980- 28:39.260* :  jobs which are in the heat with limited access to as one person pointed out even lose.
*28:40.500- 28:46.920* :  Exactly yeah so of course you know there's a stark socio-economic gradient of those people who
*28:46.920- 28:50.840* :  have to work out in these extreme heat conditions versus people who are considering their
*28:50.840- 28:56.080* :  conditioned offers. So controlling in our research for all those different factors which are also
*28:56.080- 29:00.280* :  risk factors that still birth in their own right was an important part of this research.
*29:00.800- 29:04.420* :  And is there our temperature which pauses the highest risk for these women?
*29:05.540- 29:10.140* :  That's a really good question and we don't know the exact answer to that yet. The temperature
*29:10.140- 29:16.980* :  that's risk it depends a lot on also the air humidity and other atmospheric conditions but also
*29:16.980- 29:22.200* :  importantly on the amount of work the woman's doing and her body shape and things as well. So
*29:22.580- 29:28.100* :  we're trying to develop some clearer guidelines for workplaces and for pregnant women but certainly
*29:28.100- 29:33.440* :  the advice would be to avoid. But just in the interest of time Professor Hurst for a lot of them
*29:33.440- 29:37.380* :  there's no choice but to work out in the sun. So what kind of guidelines do you suggest?
*29:38.480- 29:43.520* :  Yeah that is true. I think the guidelines would be around providing shade stations you know in
*29:43.540- 29:48.200* :  outdoor work making sure that the work is not done in the hottest part of the day and providing
*29:48.200- 29:54.040* :  women as you say with toilet facilities and water for rehydration because if there are no toilets
*29:54.420- 29:59.000* :  many women we found were dehydrating themselves so they didn't need to go to the toilet and this
*29:59.000- 30:02.860* :  would probably be making any effects of the heat on their pregnancy even worse.
*30:03.280- 30:06.960* :  And could the research have an impact on safety advice for pregnant women globally?
*30:08.200- 30:12.520* :  Definitely that's what we hope. I mean as our planet continues to warm more and more pregnant
*30:12.520- 30:17.380* :  women will be exposed to extreme heat but not just those who have no choice but to work in the
*30:17.380- 30:23.200* :  heat but women who are in high-income countries as well and those who may go on holiday to warmer
*30:23.200- 30:26.640* :  climbs during their pregnancy. Professor Jane Hurst
*30:28.160- 30:33.940* :  Peak Me hippos are normally found in the swamps and rainforests of Western Africa and in dangerous
*30:33.940- 30:39.420* :  species there's thought to be only about 2000 still living in the wild. You can of course see them
*30:39.420- 30:44.020* :  in zoos but a lack of males and captivity makes breeding efforts very complicated.
*30:44.700- 30:49.940* :  So there's much excitement in Athens at the moment. For the first time in 10 years a baby has
*30:49.940- 30:57.280* :  been born at Attica Zoological Park. Alisa Hugenboob is the head keeper there. He's a boy yes he's
*30:57.280- 31:03.800* :  a little baby boy. A lot goes into taking care of the mom while she was pregnant. End of October
*31:04.640- 31:11.220* :  as keepers and me we saw that she was slightly having a bigger belly so that same week we
*31:11.220- 31:17.800* :  involved our feds to come and check up on her and we were able to do an ultrasound which confirmed
*31:17.800- 31:24.680* :  our suspicions which she was pregnant. They're very interesting animals. They're very like the
*31:24.680- 31:31.500* :  common hippos which are as five times as big as as the pygmy hippos. They can be quite aggressive.
*31:32.100- 31:38.480* :  They have a quite big set of teeth as well for that. It's a species that has trouble in surviving
*31:38.480- 31:45.580* :  in the wild right now with pygmy hippos especially it's deforestation. So a lot of habitat loss
*31:45.580- 31:52.840* :  because we're building as humans a lot of things all around and they're losing their habitat so
*31:52.840- 31:58.840* :  the population just decreases because of that. I do hope that visitors can come now and that they
*31:58.840- 32:05.320* :  will have the interest in learning more about pygmy hippos and also seeing our little baby boy as
*32:05.360- 32:11.060* :  well. I hope they are as excited as we are about this little one. Alicia Hogan-Broom.
*32:13.820- 32:17.220* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
