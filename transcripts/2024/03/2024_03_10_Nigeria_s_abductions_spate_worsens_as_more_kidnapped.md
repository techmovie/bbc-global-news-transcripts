*00:59.900- 01:02.060* :  I'm Andrew Peachley in the early hours of Sunday,
*01:02.060- 01:04.340* :  the 10th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:04.960- 01:07.940* :  There's been a second mass kidnapping at a school in Nigeria,
*01:07.940- 01:13.380* :  as security forces continue their search for almost 300 students abducted on Thursday.
*01:14.100- 01:19.900* :  Pope Francis is a suggested Ukraine should consider itself defeated and negotiate with Russia to end the war.
*01:20.520- 01:24.260* :  Irish voters reject the government's attempt to broaden the definition of family
*01:24.600- 01:27.760* :  and alter language on the role of women in the country's constitution.
*01:29.920- 01:32.840* :  Also in this podcast, an investigation is underway in Indonesia
*01:32.840- 01:37.400* :  after two pilots finish sleep at the controls for almost half an hour,
*01:37.640- 01:39.780* :  causing their plane to drift off course.
*01:40.400- 01:42.840* :  And the Hollywood Awards, you wouldn't want to win.
*01:43.280- 01:49.600* :  And the winner of the Rising Award is...
*01:51.140- 01:53.240* :  We'll reveal the worst film of the year.
*01:57.040- 02:01.640* :  First just days after almost 300 students were taken in Nigeria's Kaduna State,
*02:01.640- 02:06.680* :  there's been another kidnapping this time at a school in the northwestern state of Sokato.
*02:07.340- 02:10.500* :  According to Nigerian officials, armed men storm the school,
*02:10.500- 02:13.280* :  taking hostage 15 students and four women.
*02:13.940- 02:16.740* :  Meanwhile, Kaduna's state governor has told BBC News
*02:16.740- 02:21.260* :  at least 28 of the school children kidnapped on Thursday have managed to escape.
*02:21.260- 02:23.600* :  It isn't yet clear who the captors are.
*02:24.120- 02:28.240* :  Our West Africa correspondent, Mione Jones, is in Borno State in my degree,
*02:28.240- 02:31.620* :  where more than 200 people were taken captive last weekend.
*02:32.020- 02:36.160* :  Details are still emerging. We just know that it happened very early in the morning.
*02:37.040- 02:40.920* :  The gunmen came into a town called Gada in Sokato,
*02:41.720- 02:45.900* :  fired in the air and as they were leaving, they spotted these 15 students
*02:45.900- 02:48.760* :  running into their dormitories and decided to take them away.
*02:49.060- 02:52.560* :  And obviously this is gaining a lot of attention because it's the third
*02:52.560- 02:56.920* :  abduction involving children in just over a week here in Northern Nigeria.
*02:57.660- 03:02.680* :  First from internally displaced children and women were abducted from just outside their camp
*03:02.680- 03:04.980* :  as it were, gathering firewoods.
*03:05.280- 03:07.780* :  It's suspected that that was carried out by book Moran fighters.
*03:08.240- 03:11.300* :  Then there was an attack on Thursday, then there was this one in Sokato.
*03:11.960- 03:15.100* :  You mentioned there being three incidents just in a few days.
*03:15.760- 03:18.980* :  Does anyone have any idea why we've seen this spate of kidnappings?
*03:18.980- 03:20.560* :  Obviously, it's something that's happened before,
*03:20.560- 03:23.540* :  but that's an awful lot of people who've been caught up in it this week.
*03:24.400- 03:26.520* :  Absolutely, particularly because we hadn't seen
*03:26.520- 03:30.260* :  mask kidnappings involving school children, at least since 2021,
*03:31.080- 03:36.220* :  whether we're a spate of kidnappings in the area of Kaduna and Katina and the North West.
*03:37.740- 03:40.520* :  Nobody's entirely sure why it's happening again this time.
*03:40.520- 03:43.220* :  Some are saying it might be because Ramadan is coming up
*03:43.680- 03:46.880* :  and previous abductees have said that around that period,
*03:46.880- 03:50.540* :  they were taken to help the armed gangs and the terror groups that have been
*03:50.880- 03:52.380* :  active across North and Nigeria.
*03:52.380- 03:57.460* :  They were abducted to help cook and do other menial tasks in their camps and the forests.
*03:58.140- 04:00.900* :  Another suggestion that had been made by some analysts is that
*04:01.360- 04:03.920* :  the economy in Nigeria is performing particularly poorly.
*04:04.320- 04:09.480* :  These gangs have over the last few years managed to exist by exporting local farmers.
*04:10.000- 04:12.160* :  Those farmers haven't made a lot of money recently,
*04:12.720- 04:15.640* :  partly because of the insecurity, so perhaps they're turning to masking
*04:15.680- 04:19.400* :  napping of children because they know that the publicity that comes around them
*04:19.400- 04:21.920* :  puts pressure on the government to pay hefty
*04:22.200- 04:23.900* :  ransoms for the return of the students.
*04:23.900- 04:26.960* :  But it has to be said, the government always denied paying ransoms
*04:27.400- 04:29.480* :  for the return of people who've been abducted.
*04:30.080- 04:31.840* :  Miley Jones with me from my degree.
*04:32.620- 04:36.560* :  Now, getting food into Gaza has become progressively more dangerous and difficult
*04:36.560- 04:41.160* :  since the start of the war there with Israeli imposing restrictions on land deliveries.
*04:41.700- 04:46.000* :  Meanwhile, the UN says a quarter of Gaza's population is on the brink of famine
*04:46.000- 04:47.780* :  with children starving to death.
*04:48.540- 04:51.620* :  The United States plans to get aid to Gaza from the sea,
*04:51.620- 04:54.320* :  but the peer its building will take around two months.
*04:54.320- 04:57.400* :  The European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen,
*04:57.660- 05:02.140* :  says she hopes a new maritime corridor to Gaza could begin operating this weekend.
*05:02.940- 05:07.420* :  Open arms is a Spanish vessel currently in the Cypriot port of Larnica,
*05:07.760- 05:11.920* :  hoping to set sail soon, carrying 200 tons of food aid.
*05:11.920- 05:15.900* :  The Spanish charity that's running this mission, also called Open Arms,
*05:15.900- 05:19.960* :  is working in tandem with the US charity World Central Kitchen.
*05:20.440- 05:24.940* :  My colleague, Nula McGovern spoke to the co-founder of Open Arms Esther Camps from Cyprus.
*05:25.660- 05:27.380* :  We expect to do it as soon as possible.
*05:27.380- 05:32.960* :  We don't not have an exact timing because it depends on many factors, not only us,
*05:33.620- 05:39.260* :  but Cyprus and many other factors that are not in our hands right now.
*05:39.540- 05:42.540* :  I understand, but are you thinking this weekend,
*05:42.740- 05:45.320* :  like potentially today or tomorrow?
*05:45.840- 05:48.520* :  We hope that this weekend we can live.
*05:48.520- 05:51.620* :  At least we are going to be ready to live this weekend.
*05:52.040- 05:53.660* :  What about Israel? Have they agreed?
*05:54.280- 06:00.440* :  As far as we know, yes, we hope that the corridor is open soon.
*06:01.280- 06:02.380* :  And what about Hamas?
*06:02.720- 06:07.060* :  Well, we know that we are going into a place in war.
*06:07.600- 06:10.480* :  We are not afraid of our security.
*06:10.480- 06:13.360* :  We think we can do it. That's why we are here.
*06:13.600- 06:16.260* :  The mission is to bring food, humanitarian aid,
*06:16.260- 06:18.980* :  that it's very, very, very needed over there.
*06:19.140- 06:20.360* :  The people is starving.
*06:20.360- 06:23.980* :  We are mostly afraid of not reaching it,
*06:24.400- 06:27.880* :  not getting over there and make this food reach the people.
*06:27.880- 06:29.500* :  I understand your mission.
*06:29.740- 06:37.600* :  But I did also see your partner, Mr. Kamp, saying that he was not concerned at all about security.
*06:38.520- 06:45.500* :  And I just wonder why that is when we have heard and seen the reports
*06:45.500- 06:50.600* :  of what it can be like on the ground or coming close to the vicinity with Gaza.
*06:51.200- 06:54.360* :  Well, first of all, if we were concerned about security,
*06:54.360- 06:58.200* :  we wouldn't be here and during this kind of mission.
*06:58.540- 07:03.420* :  We know that it's risky. We know that there is a lot of problems.
*07:04.320- 07:07.860* :  But we have this blessing of Cyprus.
*07:08.580- 07:12.820* :  Yesterday Ursula, under legend, also speak about this mission.
*07:12.820- 07:14.940* :  So we have many eyes on us.
*07:15.200- 07:19.380* :  Yeah, we know that it's risky, but we are going to try it anyway.
*07:20.300- 07:25.000* :  In order that later, other actors can join this mission and make it bigger,
*07:25.000- 07:28.580* :  because it's also a small mission.
*07:28.580- 07:32.020* :  We are trying to get 200 pallets.
*07:32.020- 07:34.300* :  It's around 200 tons of eight.
*07:34.700- 07:37.800* :  And with that 200 tons, is that all food aid?
*07:38.420- 07:43.560* :  Yeah, some would say that it may not have a huge impact because of those figures.
*07:43.560- 07:47.420* :  It's hard to decipher exactly how many people that might feed.
*07:48.300- 07:52.180* :  Some estimates are maybe 300,000 people for one day.
*07:52.180- 07:57.800* :  Exactly. It's, as I was saying, it's a drop of water into the ocean.
*07:58.120- 08:00.080* :  So you see us as symbolic.
*08:00.080- 08:01.220* :  Tell me. Exactly.
*08:01.600- 08:04.120* :  There are no functioning ports in Gaza.
*08:04.120- 08:08.520* :  How are you going to get that food to the people who need it?
*08:09.020- 08:15.740* :  Yeah, these details, we must keep confidential by now to ensure the success of the mission.
*08:15.740- 08:21.360* :  We are not allowed to give any information about this yet.
*08:21.360- 08:24.440* :  Tell me about your role in the coming days.
*08:24.440- 08:31.620* :  I am unable to see man, but I will also be coordinating the mission from work.
*08:31.960- 08:36.160* :  And I will be the contact person also on our team in Larnaca,
*08:36.160- 08:39.440* :  even in Spain and the authorities here in Cyprus.
*08:39.780- 08:42.460* :  So this could be a risk mission for you personally.
*08:42.460- 08:45.720* :  Exactly. In fact, it is.
*08:46.020- 08:49.120* :  Do you have any pause about that? Any quams? Concerns?
*08:49.260- 08:53.140* :  I am really positive. If you ask me like two weeks ago,
*08:53.140- 08:55.980* :  I would tell you that this mission was impossible.
*08:56.480- 08:59.600* :  But now I only think that it will be difficult.
*08:59.600- 09:00.840* :  It will be challenging.
*09:00.840- 09:05.000* :  But I'm convinced that it is going to be a successful mission.
*09:05.000- 09:08.080* :  We are going to open this maritime corridor.
*09:08.380- 09:10.080* :  And we are doing our best to try.
*09:10.600- 09:14.900* :  Esther Camps, onboard the vessel, open arms, talking to my colleague, Nula McGovern.
*09:15.900- 09:17.800* :  Pope Francis has suggested that Ukraine
*09:17.800- 09:20.920* :  should have what he called the courage of the white flag
*09:20.920- 09:24.780* :  and negotiate an end to the war against invading Russian forces.
*09:25.440- 09:28.340* :  He made these comments in an interview which was recorded last month
*09:28.340- 09:31.860* :  with the Swiss broadcaster RSI. Here's Danny Abahard.
*09:32.240- 09:35.460* :  With this interview, Pope Francis has entered contentious ground.
*09:36.200- 09:40.540* :  He's asked in a video clip about Ukraine where the surrendering was a courageous thing
*09:40.540- 09:43.040* :  or a legitimization of the law of the strongest.
*09:43.100- 09:46.700* :  The pontiff in his response said that when, in his words,
*09:47.040- 09:50.380* :  you see you are defeated, you have to have the courage to negotiate.
*09:51.180- 09:53.780* :  Timely negotiations could avoid, he suggested,
*09:53.780- 09:57.720* :  a situation where you end up in a worse place despite more deaths.
*09:58.500- 10:02.180* :  War, he argued, requires two parties, and he's always a defeat,
*10:02.540- 10:04.560* :  a human one, not a geographical one.
*10:05.160- 10:09.720* :  Ukraine has not responded so far, but Kiev will not welcome the Pope's intercession.
*10:09.720- 10:13.420* :  President Zelensky rejects talk he considers defeatist,
*10:13.740- 10:16.440* :  insisting his nation will beat the Russian aggressors.
*10:17.100- 10:20.780* :  In what's thought to be a world first, doctors here in London have successfully
*10:20.780- 10:25.540* :  tried a new approach to treating one of the most aggressive forms of brain cancer.
*10:26.200- 10:30.640* :  People diagnosed with glioblastoma typically don't survive for more than nine months,
*10:30.640- 10:35.780* :  at least not until now. This breakthrough involved using drugs that prompt the immune system
*10:35.780- 10:40.800* :  to target the tumour. The beneficiary of the new treatment was a 41-year-old Englishman
*10:40.800- 10:45.260* :  called Ben Trotman, who's still doing well almost a year and a half after surgery.
*10:45.860- 10:50.120* :  My colleague Gabriel Gaithaus spoke to Dr. Paul Marl Holland from University College Hospital
*10:50.120- 10:57.040* :  in London, who led the trial. Ben came into the trial and the idea was that he'd have a biopsy
*10:57.540- 11:02.320* :  and then the immunotherapy and then he'd go for more surgery. We gave him the immunotherapy
*11:02.320- 11:08.420* :  and he developed a really severe headache. So severe, we ended up admitting him for four or five days.
*11:08.920- 11:13.420* :  Now oddly enough, it was quite pleasing that he's got this massive headache because it meant
*11:13.420- 11:17.380* :  that there was something happening. The immune system was going into the brain and doing something.
*11:17.380- 11:24.660* :  So his white cells were activated and they then found this inflammatory process in his brain,
*11:24.660- 11:29.720* :  which is the tumour, and they all started congregating there. We didn't do any more surgery,
*11:29.720- 11:34.900* :  we knew he had active disease there. So we said we'll go back to the standard treatment of having
*11:34.900- 11:40.520* :  radiotherapy and chemotherapy and then three months after the radiotherapy, we did a scan and
*11:40.520- 11:45.520* :  it showed that he had no evidence of high-grade disease. Well that's incredible and great news for
*11:45.520- 11:51.020* :  him. How do you know it was the immunotherapy that did it and not the radiotherapy and the chemotherapy?
*11:51.020- 11:57.860* :  It's very unusual to see such a response. It's just very atypical. Have you tried it on other
*11:57.860- 12:04.180* :  patients? The same immunotherapy we gave it in the study after the radiotherapy and the trial did
*12:04.180- 12:08.800* :  not show a survival advantage. It did not work if you give it after the radiotherapy.
*12:08.800- 12:16.420* :  This form of brain cancer, glioblastoma, is incredibly aggressive. The apparent success of
*12:16.420- 12:22.900* :  the treatment that you gave to Ben, what are the implications for others? We had the trial open
*12:22.960- 12:29.220* :  and unfortunately it did not get recruitment, so we had to terminate the study. Why did you not
*12:29.220- 12:35.400* :  get recruitment? I think that it's a challenge to change standard practice, which is surgery
*12:35.400- 12:42.140* :  radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We'd like the opportunity to have more trials. We think that all
*12:42.140- 12:46.400* :  patients should have an opportunity to enter a trial if they're well enough and if they want to.
*12:46.700- 12:51.900* :  Can we just go back to patient Ben? What are his prospects? Do we know that it's gone,
*12:51.900- 12:57.060* :  that it's not going to come back? No, we don't know. He knows that it could come back at any time,
*12:57.060- 13:03.620* :  but his prospects are I think better than they were. He had active disease which is not there now
*13:03.620- 13:10.240* :  and we hope that he just stays as well as he is. Brain cancer specialist Dr. Paul Moore Holland
*13:10.240- 13:17.440* :  with Gabriel Gage House and still to come. They will still be Asian elephants but they will

*15:14.060- 15:17.720* :  Julian Fowler The Irish government's intention was to change
*15:17.720- 15:24.320* :  two causes of the constitution which was written in 1937. One was to expand the definition of family
*15:24.320- 15:29.480* :  to include unmarried couples and single parent families. The other was to update the so-called
*15:29.480- 15:34.620* :  women in the home clause. The constitution currently says that mothers should not have to go out
*15:34.620- 15:39.480* :  into the workplace to the neglect of their duties in the home, which supporters of the change
*15:39.480- 15:45.620* :  argued was sexist and outdated. However, the wording on the ballot papers raised concerns over care,
*15:45.620- 15:51.400* :  disability and taxation. The Irish Prime Minister, Leo Verratka, said it was clear both amendments
*15:51.400- 15:56.920* :  had been defeated comprehensively on a respectable turnout, and he accepted responsibility for the
*15:56.920- 16:03.040* :  result on behalf of his government. The Pacific Ocean is vast, but control of its waters is mostly
*16:03.040- 16:08.760* :  down to the many tiny island nations dotted around it with massive zones of economic control.
*16:09.460- 16:13.780* :  Some years ago, many such Pacific nations signed up to a global initiative to protect
*16:13.780- 16:20.980* :  30% of the ocean by 2030. One nation, Palau, went a lot further than that, but as the BBC's
*16:20.980- 16:24.400* :  Frey Limsey's been finding out, some on the islands say that was a mistake.
*16:28.880- 16:34.000* :  I'm on board the National Geographic Society research vessel, the Argo, off the coast of Palau.
*16:34.480- 16:39.760* :  Victor Nesta and Dr. Pierre Abyondi, researchers with the Palau International Coral Reef Centre,
*16:40.000- 16:45.200* :  are collecting water samples. Once the seawater is collected, it's put in a special filtering
*16:45.200- 16:50.800* :  device to extract all the biological information it can. That way it measures the biodiversity
*16:51.140- 16:56.440* :  of the thousands of meters of ocean below us. It's called environmental or EDNA.
*16:57.940- 17:06.640* :  So basically, it's all the organic particles that in this case we can find in the water that we
*17:06.680- 17:14.120* :  collect. So in our case, we focus on fish or vertebrates in general. The Argo is here in the waters
*17:14.120- 17:19.460* :  around Palau at the request of the Palauan government. They've been asked to assess the biodiversity
*17:19.600- 17:25.980* :  around the waters in Palau's EEZ, or exclusive economic zone. The actual landmass of Palau
*17:25.980- 17:31.000* :  is quite small, but because it's an archipelago and EEZ waters extend for hundreds of kilometers
*17:31.000- 17:36.560* :  around each island. It adds up to an area of ocean around the size of France. Now, Palau made headlines
*17:36.560- 17:43.480* :  and one global acclaim in 2015 when it agreed to create a maritime sanctuary in 80% of these
*17:43.480- 17:49.040* :  waters. Lucas SL is a marine scientist with the Palauan Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and
*17:49.040- 17:54.720* :  Environment. We wanted to do conservation. We thought it was important for not only Palauans now,
*17:54.720- 18:00.180* :  but our younger generations. One of the other concerns was that the current fishery that was
*18:00.180- 18:08.100* :  happening within the EEZ then was predominantly foreign. We felt that we weren't capturing the value
*18:08.100- 18:14.300* :  of the fishery that we thought we deserved. The current president, Serangel Wips Jr. though,
*18:14.300- 18:19.580* :  says this plan hasn't worked out and he's pushing to open up more of Palau's waters to commercial
*18:19.580- 18:28.860* :  use. What we've been working on is how do we 100% manage our oceans in the most effective way
*18:29.180- 18:37.180* :  to optimize those resources for the sustainable use and for the people. So the size of the sanctuary
*18:38.000- 18:44.220* :  to me is just a number. It should be relevant. That's really what's important. What's the
*18:44.220- 18:51.800* :  right size and how does it really at the end of the day provide for the economic needs of the
*18:52.020- 18:56.960* :  local people, but at the same time ensure that we can continue to fish for generations to come.
*18:57.580- 19:03.540* :  When it came out that President Wips was considering rolling back this much faded 80% marine sanctuary,
*19:03.540- 19:09.820* :  he received backlash from within Palau and all around the world. But he says Palau is being unfairly
*19:09.820- 19:14.660* :  singled out to be a leader on conservation, when other much larger countries could be doing more
*19:14.660- 19:20.420* :  themselves. Freylin's in reporting. Aviation authorities in Indonesia are investigating an
*19:20.420- 19:27.480* :  incident in which both the pilot and the co-pilot of a plane fell asleep during a flight. The 157
*19:27.480- 19:32.200* :  passengers and crew on board were unaware of what was happening as the plane drifted off its
*19:32.200- 19:38.760* :  flight path. See the hat and has the story. The episode involving two sleeping pilots took place
*19:38.760- 19:44.840* :  during a domestic batik air flight in late January on a routine journey from Southeast
*19:44.840- 19:51.700* :  Sulawesi province to the capital Jakarta. The plane's pilot had originally requested permission
*19:51.700- 19:58.420* :  from his co-pilot to rest, but the second in command also then fell asleep at the controls.
*19:59.320- 20:05.120* :  Both pilots slept for approximately 28 minutes of the more than two hour journey.
*20:05.880- 20:12.060* :  Their failure to guide the plane led it to go off course, though no one was harmed and it landed
*20:12.060- 20:18.940* :  normally. Indonesia's Transportation Safety Committee noted the co-pilot was a new father
*20:18.940- 20:23.940* :  to one month old twins and had not been sleeping well at home.
*20:24.740- 20:30.020* :  Next to Pakistan and for the second time, Asif Ali Zadari is the country's president.
*20:30.020- 20:35.720* :  He was voted in dissonally by a national and provincial lawmaker following recent parliamentary
*20:35.720- 20:41.480* :  elections which were marred by accusations of voting irregularities. Mr Zadari is the
*20:41.480- 20:44.700* :  widower of the assassinated former prime minister Benazia Bhutto.
*20:45.360- 20:49.220* :  Our South Asia regional editor and barrison at the Rajan told me more about him.
*20:49.760- 20:55.720* :  Many people in Pakistan would describe him as someone who is a master of reconciliation who can
*20:56.480- 21:02.220* :  deal with all the political parties and then bring about some sort of agreement and that is the
*21:02.220- 21:07.560* :  hope for many people in Pakistan at this point because the country is going through a very
*21:07.560- 21:13.740* :  difficult phase both in terms of political as well as economical. What especially the ruling
*21:13.740- 21:20.040* :  coalition want is to build a consensus among the political parties. Now we had the Prime Minister
*21:20.040- 21:25.120* :  election last week, Shabar Sharif from the Pakistan Muslim League, Nawaz Faction was elected,
*21:25.720- 21:31.600* :  now the president. So everyone hopes that the next step will be look forward to what Pakistan can do.
*21:32.220- 21:37.800* :  As you know Zadari was the husband of the slain premier Benazia Bhutto. He had spent a lot of
*21:37.800- 21:43.620* :  time in jail on various corruption charges before but he was always described as someone who can
*21:43.620- 21:48.520* :  always wriggle out of a very difficult situation and then reach a comfortable position.
*21:48.520- 21:54.820* :  And because of his extensive connections there is a lot of hope and a master of reconciliation is
*21:54.820- 21:59.540* :  what Pakistan needs right now politically economically. Can he sort any of this stuff out?
*22:00.400- 22:05.920* :  That's the hope but the challenges are huge. We're talking about the inflation running around
*22:05.920- 22:12.800* :  22-23 percent and now Pakistan has to go to the IMF for another set of loans. They need
*22:12.800- 22:18.140* :  five to six billion dollars. That foreign exchange currency reserves are around seven billion but
*22:18.140- 22:24.480* :  not enough. But what this also means is structural reforms that means the prices of gas and
*22:24.480- 22:30.080* :  electricity can go up. That means that can trigger more public anger. Fixed the economy. That is
*22:30.080- 22:34.800* :  the major thing. And second is of course the increasing militant attacks in the north particularly
*22:34.800- 22:41.380* :  by Tehkari Kitaliban which wants to impose asharia law in Pakistan. And is there any optimism among
*22:41.420- 22:46.840* :  ordinary people in Pakistan at the moment? Is anyone think that the country is turning a corner
*22:46.840- 22:54.360* :  and that the solution is not too far away? If you ask supporters of the former prime minister
*22:54.360- 22:59.960* :  Imran Khan was currently in jail on corruption conviction they would say that the mandate was stolen.
*23:01.520- 23:06.900* :  That party it won the highest number of seats. Though you did not get majority what the party
*23:06.900- 23:14.180* :  says is that in many places war-tricking was taking on. So there is a huge divide. On the other hand
*23:14.180- 23:20.540* :  Pakistan is a nuclear armed country and that's a country of 240 million people without consensus
*23:20.540- 23:27.000* :  if people are going to go to the streets against this huge structural reforms. That is why they hope
*23:27.460- 23:29.540* :  that they already can bring all these parties together.
*23:30.100- 23:36.120* :  Unbarassan etharagin with me. Wolley mammoths were extinct 4,000 years ago. So you might think
*23:36.120- 23:41.020* :  that was the pretty definitive end to the species. The scientists from a biotech firm,
*23:41.020- 23:45.280* :  so they have made a breakthrough in their attempt to resurrect these prehistoric animals.
*23:45.920- 23:50.660* :  For the first time they have created stem cells from Asian elephants, the mammoths closest
*23:50.660- 23:56.640* :  living relative. It's hoped this so-called de-extinction project could lead to new ways to protect
*23:56.640- 24:02.400* :  endangered species. Professor George Church co-founded the company behind all this colossal
*24:02.400- 24:08.560* :  biosciences. Many elephant species and even elephant genera have entered bread over the years.
*24:08.560- 24:13.000* :  And so this is just another example of a hybrid. This will be close enough to an Asian elephant
*24:13.000- 24:18.540* :  that we really are helping that endangered species by providing them with the ability to live in
*24:18.540- 24:25.580* :  a broader set of climates away from the challenge of living in dense human populated areas mostly in
*24:25.580- 24:31.540* :  Asia. So this process will actually help existing elephants take on some of the characteristics of
*24:31.540- 24:36.160* :  Wolley mammoths. That's our hope is that they will still be Asian elephants but they will look and
*24:36.160- 24:41.560* :  behave such that they can live at minus 40 degrees in the wintertime for months on end. The question
*24:41.560- 24:46.740* :  is why are you actually doing this? What's the reason behind this project? So there's a number one
*24:46.740- 24:52.420* :  is the endangered species, very charismatic species, all elephants are endangered. Number two is
*24:52.420- 24:58.560* :  the environment of the Arctic is endangered and there's lots of carbon at risk and the elephants
*24:58.560- 25:05.960* :  were among the herbivores that humans drove to extinction 10 to 4,000 years ago and they kept it
*25:05.960- 25:11.120* :  in a grassland which was much more vibrant better at sequestering carbon and keeping it sequestered.
*25:11.420- 25:17.480* :  So conservation technology in general. And the idea of trying to revive extinct animals has been
*25:17.480- 25:23.700* :  controversial in the past. What's your view on that? Usually it's presented as either or either we
*25:23.700- 25:30.160* :  can do conservation and endangered species or we can do extinct. In this case we can do both
*25:30.200- 25:35.960* :  because the DNA that we're getting for the ancient species could help the modern species to survive
*25:35.960- 25:41.740* :  by allowing them to move further away from human population centers. Is this a new species and
*25:41.740- 25:45.920* :  does it need a name like a mammothand or an elemoth? We were just thinking about that. I don't
*25:45.920- 25:51.180* :  think it's a new species. These elephants enter bread already which is one of the species definitions.
*25:51.180- 25:58.020* :  It will be readable with Asian elephants almost certainly. And how long might it be before we
*25:58.020- 26:04.920* :  see a workable real life? Elemoth, mammoth, whatever you want to call it? The CO set a challenge
*26:04.920- 26:09.700* :  of six years about two years ago so it's another four years due and we're still on track now
*26:10.100- 26:15.660* :  getting these stem cells which is the event today that we're celebrating. That was an unknown but
*26:15.740- 26:19.800* :  now we've got that that opens the gates for all sorts of things that have been piling up that we
*26:19.800- 26:25.900* :  wanted to do like editing the genome so now we can do that. Professor George Church from Colossal
*26:25.900- 26:33.220* :  Biosciences. It's the antidote to the Oscars later today the Golden Raspberry Awards or the Razzis
*26:33.220- 26:38.580* :  which celebrate Hollywood's biggest cinematic flops. This year's main winner or victim
*26:38.580- 26:45.300* :  is a horror film based on a much beloved fictional bear. We should be close now. We're not going
*26:45.300- 26:50.940* :  to find them. We will. Who piglet? E or we were friends for many years.
*26:53.300- 26:58.140* :  That's from Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey shortly before Christopher Robin discovers that his
*26:58.140- 27:04.000* :  childhood friends have gone feral in the woods. The film scored only a 3% rating on film review
*27:04.000- 27:09.400* :  website Rotten Tomatoes more now from our culture reporter Charlotte Gallagher. When you look at
*27:09.400- 27:14.560* :  the reviews it probably would be quicker to tell you what was right with the film so the critics say
*27:14.560- 27:20.500* :  lack of humor poor acting poor screenplay easily forgettable one said that the scenes are so poorly
*27:20.500- 27:26.200* :  lit they couldn't actually see what was going on at times because it was so dark however it cost
*27:26.200- 27:34.680* :  $100,000 to make this film and it actually made 5.2 million so it did well for a very small budget
*27:34.680- 27:39.360* :  that's an incredibly small budget for a film a lot of people like this film and actually the
*27:39.360- 27:44.820* :  publicity from the razzis might mean more people see it as well but it didn't just pick up
*27:44.820- 27:49.920* :  worst picture no it really did sweep the board so obviously you said worst picture worst remake
*27:49.920- 27:56.780* :  ripoff or sequel worst director worst screenplay and worst on screen couple that went to poo and
*27:56.780- 28:03.300* :  piglet this hasn't put off the makers of the film though because they're going they're going
*28:03.300- 28:07.200* :  for gold they're going for our sequel you can actually see it in cinemas this month they've
*28:07.200- 28:12.140* :  spent loads more money on this film as well because the first one did so well so the first film
*28:12.140- 28:18.040* :  they spent about $700 on Winnie the Pooh's costume and the prosthetics this film they've
*28:18.040- 28:24.560* :  spent $20,000 so the prosthetics the costumes were criticised in the first one so it's hoping
*28:24.560- 28:28.440* :  the filmmakers have their fingers crossed they'll get better reviews for the second but I suppose
*28:28.440- 28:32.900* :  they're laughing all the way to the bank aren't they yeah so Winnie the Pooh not very good who were
*28:32.900- 28:40.660* :  the other victims winners how should we put it a real mention for poor old Megan Fox she won worst
*28:40.660- 28:48.260* :  actress and worst supporting actress for Johnny and Clyde and the fourth expendables John Voight
*28:48.260- 28:55.080* :  and Oscar winner he won worst actor for Mercy and Irish mobster film and Sylvester Stallone he won
*28:55.080- 29:00.500* :  worst supporting actor for the fourth expendables film so some big names but you know what it is
*29:00.500- 29:04.660* :  a bit of fun and a lot of people see it as a way to kind of burst a few egos yeah and in the old days
*29:04.660- 29:10.900* :  the actors used to try and turn up at the ceremony yes so Halle Berry won a Razzie and she turned up to
*29:10.900- 29:16.080* :  collect her Razzie with the Oscar that she'd won Sandra Bullock she won an Oscar and a Razzie and
*29:16.080- 29:21.460* :  she turned up now it's very much online and a lot of people don't go to the event anymore but it's
*29:21.460- 29:25.020* :  still a lot of fun when you see these films especially things like Winnie the Pooh blood and honey
*29:25.020- 29:30.080* :  so badly also well depending on your viewpoint our culture reporter Charlotte Gallagher
*29:31.360- 29:35.700* :  and that's all from us for now there'll be a new edition of global news to download later if you'd
