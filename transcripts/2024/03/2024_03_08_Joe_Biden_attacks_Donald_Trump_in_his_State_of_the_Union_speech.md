*00:39.540- 00:46.520* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 8th of March, these are our main stories.
*00:47.040- 00:52.720* :  Joe Biden attacks Donald Trump in the last state of the Union speech before the US election.
*00:53.280- 00:58.800* :  Both the US and the European Union announced plans to bring large-scale humanitarian aid
*00:58.800- 01:03.720* :  into Gaza by sea. Raids are carried out in India against traffickers who've been
*01:03.720- 01:11.740* :  tricking people into joining the Russian army. Also in this podcast could the Oscars provide a
*01:20.360- 01:25.040* :  morale boost for the Ukrainians. And international women's day, what is its significance today?
*01:28.480- 01:34.960* :  But first President Joe Biden has taken on critics who say he's too old at 81 to run for office
*01:34.960- 01:40.600* :  again, delivering a fiery state of the Union speech and claiming that freedom and democracy are
*01:40.600- 01:46.260* :  under assault around the world. Mr. Biden used the term my predecessor to refer to Donald Trump
*01:46.260- 01:52.460* :  13 times in a speech that lasted more than an hour. He accused his likely opponent in the election
*01:52.460- 01:58.380* :  later this year of bowing down to Russia and criticised him over the capital riot. Mr. Biden
*01:58.380- 02:04.300* :  also covered immigration, abortion, the economy and Gaza. His approach to the war in Gaza has
*02:04.300- 02:09.640* :  been one factor that's been lowering his approval ratings and he used the speech to announce that
*02:09.640- 02:15.860* :  the US military will construct a temporary port in Gaza to help get more humanitarian aid to
*02:15.860- 02:21.720* :  the territory. And North America correspondent Nomiya Ikbal was watching and has this report from
*02:21.720- 02:28.540* :  Washington. This was President Biden's make or break moment to show Americans why he should be
*02:28.540- 02:37.520* :  re-elected. No pressure. Good evening. The fire is smart. I go home now. It was a more fiery speech
*02:37.520- 02:43.120* :  than usual as the 81-year-old tried to prove he's not too old for office. The speech turned
*02:43.120- 02:48.920* :  quickly into campaign mode. What makes our moment rare is the freedom and democracy under attack
*02:48.920- 02:56.220* :  at both at home and overseas at the very same time. Though he never referred to his election
*02:56.220- 03:02.740* :  rival by name. Now my predecessor, a former Republican president tells Putin, quote,
*03:03.360- 03:08.960* :  do whatever the hell you want. But Donald Trump was on his mind. He reminded America of what
*03:08.960- 03:15.820* :  happened in this very building on January the 6, three years ago. Many of you are here on that
*03:15.820- 03:22.680* :  darkest of days. We all saw with our own eyes the insurrections were not patriots. There were
*03:22.680- 03:28.620* :  some hikers and views by his Republican opponents. He touched on issues that voters care about,
*03:28.620- 03:34.820* :  immigration, the economy and reproductive rights. Many of you in this chamber and my predecessor
*03:34.820- 03:40.440* :  are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. My God, what freedom else would you take
*03:40.440- 03:46.060* :  away? I'd like hell for the living. But the journey to get here wasn't straightforward.
*03:49.400- 03:54.320* :  Protests are the gathered here blocking the main road from the White House to the Capitol.
*03:54.980- 03:58.800* :  President Biden ended up taking a longer route to make his address on time.
*03:59.500- 04:03.700* :  But his handling of the war in the Middle East is proving to be one of the biggest issues
*04:03.700- 04:09.120* :  he's facing ahead of the election. I think he's already lost votes from many people,
*04:09.300- 04:12.900* :  from younger voters, from the area of investment voters, from Jewish voters.
*04:14.060- 04:18.560* :  The war wasn't ignored in the speech. He paid tribute to the families of Israeli hostages who
*04:18.560- 04:24.240* :  were invited to the address. Mr. Biden said he was also working to help deliver aid to Palestinians.
*04:24.900- 04:29.600* :  I'm directing the U.S. military to lead and merge the mission to establish a temporary
*04:29.600- 04:34.460* :  peer in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments,
*04:35.000- 04:37.360* :  carrying food, water, medicine, and temporary shelter.
*04:39.760- 04:44.080* :  The state of the union with Mr. Biden's big opportunity to get some fresh momentum ahead of
*04:44.080- 04:48.220* :  the election. If he loses in November, it would be the last one he delivers.
*04:49.620- 04:56.100* :  Nomi Ekbal in Washington. In his state of the union speech, President Biden also said that
*04:56.100- 05:00.060* :  the U.S. plans to build a temporary port in Gaza to boost aid deliveries,
*05:00.640- 05:04.220* :  speaking at a news conference at United Nations headquarters in New York.
*05:04.220- 05:10.360* :  The U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, secret carg, gave her reaction to the plan.
*05:10.760- 05:14.920* :  We welcome this. At the same time, I cannot, but repeat.
*05:16.000- 05:19.420* :  Air and sea is not a substitute for land, and nobody says otherwise.
*05:19.600- 05:23.520* :  The additionality, however, at this critical juncture will be very important.
*05:23.840- 05:29.180* :  Our correspondent, Yehland Nell, who's in Jerusalem, told me a little more about how the plan
*05:29.180- 05:35.520* :  would work. This comes amid the U.N.'s warnings of widespread famine among the 2.3 million Palestinians
*05:35.520- 05:41.380* :  in Gaza. It does look very much like a political move on the part of Mr. Biden, the desire to show
*05:41.820- 05:47.060* :  some kind of a concrete step. It's a reflection, too, of the frustration the U.S. has at the moment
*05:47.060- 05:52.000* :  with its close ally, Israel. It's been calling on it repeatedly in recent weeks to increase the
*05:52.000- 05:56.420* :  flow of aid. Going into Gaza, but Israel has been very reluctant to open more crossings,
*05:56.420- 06:01.480* :  or to make its Mediterranean ports, like Ash Dodd, which is about a 40-minute drive away from
*06:01.480- 06:05.840* :  the north of Gaza, more available for incoming aid. I mean, what you have at the moment is a
*06:05.840- 06:10.780* :  majority of aid being flown to Egypt and entering via two southern crossings.
*06:11.340- 06:15.740* :  Now, Gaza doesn't have a deep sea port, so what's being proposed here is to have a kind of
*06:15.740- 06:21.480* :  temporary peer to transport supplies from ships coming via Cyprus, which is where Israeli security
*06:21.480- 06:26.060* :  checks will take place, and then brought in to the shore of Gaza. But still a lot of logistical
*06:26.060- 06:31.700* :  questions about exactly how distribution will take place. Meanwhile, the European Commission
*06:31.700- 06:37.440* :  is today trialling a new maritime corridor for delivering aid from Cyprus. On a visit there,
*06:37.440- 06:42.520* :  the organization's president, Ursula Fondalein, said she hoped the initiative would be rolled out
*06:42.520- 06:48.040* :  by Sunday. We know the difficulties faced at the land borders in Gaza, be it through the Rafa
*06:48.040- 06:56.560* :  border crossing or through the Jordan Road corridor. And that is why today, the Republic of Cyprus,
*06:57.460- 07:04.920* :  the European Commission, the United Arab Emirates and the United States, of course supported by
*07:04.920- 07:13.800* :  other critical partners, announced our intent to open the maritime corridor to deliver much needed
*07:13.800- 07:17.640* :  additional amounts of humanitarian assistance by sea.
*07:18.020- 07:24.280* :  A head of the European Commission, Ursula Fondalein. Meanwhile, the UN agency operating in Gaza
*07:24.280- 07:29.980* :  UNRA has published a report detailing widespread abuse of Palestinians in makeshift Israeli detention
*07:29.980- 07:35.480* :  camps. Israel's military insists that mistreatment of detainees is absolutely prohibited.
*07:36.020- 07:40.740* :  Our chief international correspondent, Leastu Set, told me more about the UN report.
*07:41.560- 07:47.820* :  Well, this is an internal UN report that the BBC has seen. It's described as a draft report.
*07:48.700- 07:55.880* :  But the kinds of testimony from Palestinian detainees that it includes very much tally with reports
*07:55.880- 08:03.480* :  published recently by Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups as well as in separate UN
*08:03.480- 08:11.620* :  investigations. They include a wide range of abuse being stripped in beaten, being forced into
*08:11.620- 08:17.380* :  cages and attacked by dogs, forced into stress positions for extended periods of time,
*08:18.280- 08:25.360* :  and subjected to what it describes as blunt force trauma. That's the use of butts of guns and
*08:25.360- 08:34.120* :  boots against many parts of the body. All of this based on the UN says this is unra, the main
*08:34.120- 08:42.420* :  UN agency operating in Gaza. It says it spoke to about a hundred detainees as they were released
*08:42.420- 08:49.220* :  from Israel at the Karem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza. It says it obtained those
*08:49.220- 08:55.380* :  accounts as part of its role, coordinating humanitarian aid there. But it estimates that
*08:55.420- 09:02.260* :  about a 4,000 more detainees from Gaza are still being held in Israeli detention centers.
*09:02.900- 09:08.440* :  It was able to document about a thousand who were freed. He is right is, though, so they're not
*09:08.440- 09:14.460* :  mistreating anyone. We ask the Israeli defence forces for a statement. They absolutely denied
*09:14.460- 09:20.460* :  there was mistreatment. They said it was absolutely prohibited. It said a contravened idea values
*09:20.460- 09:29.180* :  as well as orders. It specifically denied allegations such as denying detainees, water or food
*09:29.180- 09:35.900* :  or medical care, as well as appropriate bedding, and it dismissed the accusations of sexual violence
*09:35.980- 09:42.220* :  seeing it as Hamas propaganda, which it said was trying to establish a false equivalence
*09:42.800- 09:49.160* :  between what it describes as Hamas's systematic use of rape as a weapon of war. And I should
*09:49.800- 09:54.960* :  underline that there was no allegation of rape in the account in this document. And it should
*09:54.960- 10:01.060* :  also be pointed out that this is a very tense moment between Israel and Unra. Unra is now
*10:01.060- 10:07.240* :  under investigation itself after Israel presented a document to accusing a number of unra,
*10:07.240- 10:13.240* :  employees of being part of the Hamas attacks of October the 7th. When immediately sacked those
*10:13.240- 10:20.940* :  employees, it's now investigating those claims that also led to nearly 20 countries and institutions
*10:20.940- 10:26.760* :  suspending, when responding just at the time it was desperately needed. But the European Union
*10:26.760- 10:32.800* :  now has resumed the support and we understand that other countries are planning to do the same.
*10:33.160- 10:40.880* :  Least you said, 10 years ago on Friday, a Malaysian airliner carrying 239 people on a routine
*10:40.880- 10:46.880* :  flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing vanished, in what has become one of the greatest aviation
*10:46.900- 10:51.640* :  mysteries. There was no distress call, nor any indication of a problem. The aircraft,
*10:51.640- 10:58.280* :  a Boeing 777, has never been found, despite the largest and most expensive search operation
*10:58.280- 11:03.560* :  ever mounted. A few parts of the plane eventually washed up thousands of kilometers away,
*11:04.040- 11:09.420* :  and the analysis of radar and satellite data showed it had turned around a headed far
*11:09.420- 11:15.440* :  into a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean. As Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan
*11:15.440- 11:22.380* :  Head, who's covered the extraordinary story of flight MH370 from the start, reports from Kuala Lumpur.
*11:28.200- 11:31.720* :  At a Buddhist temple not far from Kuala Lumpur International Airport,
*11:31.720- 11:38.960* :  relatives from China marked 10 years since their inexplicable loss on flight MH370.
*11:39.860- 11:46.240* :  More than 150 of those on board were from China. One was 29-year-old Li Yem Lin.
*11:46.940- 11:50.500* :  He was the first person in his small farming village to go to university,
*11:50.540- 11:57.580* :  the first to get a job overseas. His parents, father Li Eryou and mother Liu Shuang Feng
*11:58.040- 12:00.640* :  are still struggling to make sense of what happened.
*12:08.640- 12:15.180* :  These years I keep asking, what does that mean? I have been searching for my child for the past 10
*12:15.180- 12:21.660* :  years, and I think that if you lose contact with someone, surely you should be able to reconnect with them.
*12:28.940- 12:34.840* :  45 minutes into the flight, this was the last communication between the pilot and air traffic control.
*12:35.820- 12:37.800* :  Nothing more was ever heard from it.
*12:39.160- 12:46.140* :  This year lack of information created confusion as journalists sought answers from equally
*12:46.140- 12:53.480* :  baffled Malaysian officials. There was no such distress signal or distress call,
*12:54.200- 12:56.060* :  so we are equally puzzled to why.
*12:58.480- 13:02.600* :  A three-year-long search involving 26 countries found nothing.
*13:03.540- 13:07.380* :  Here it is. There are six aircraft on the one station today.
*13:07.900- 13:13.980* :  This was a New Zealand Air Force surveillance plane heading out, one of more than 300 such flights.
*13:14.940- 13:21.340* :  There was no organized search of beaches and shorelines for floating debris.
*13:21.340- 13:28.160* :  The extraordinary mystery of MH370 also drew in amateur sleuths and researchers like Blaine Gibson.
*13:28.540- 13:33.760* :  It simply hadn't been done. They were spending millions of dollars searching under water,
*13:34.660- 13:40.280* :  and I just thought, well, probably the first piece of this plane is just going to be found by someone
*13:41.020- 13:45.920* :  walking on the beach, and I thought, well, I can go ahead and do that myself.
*13:46.460- 13:52.220* :  The first piece was found not by Blaine on the French island of Reunion, more than a year after
*13:52.220- 13:56.620* :  the plane vanished. Blaine found several more on East African beaches.
*13:57.420- 14:02.240* :  For Grace Nathan, whose mother Anne had been on board, it was painful news.
*14:02.880- 14:07.520* :  I remember the day that we learnt of the first piece of debris being found.
*14:08.180- 14:12.000* :  Some part of my world just came crashing down, because this was the first point
*14:12.000- 14:16.880* :  that I had had to, on some level, accept that the plane may have crashed.
*14:23.920- 14:28.360* :  But the plane still hasn't been found, and the last search stopped six years ago.
*14:29.100- 14:35.560* :  So the families hold these commemoration events every year to keep MH370 in the public eye.
*14:36.140- 14:42.760* :  No words can describe the sadness and grief of the religious families and friends.
*14:42.760- 14:45.880* :  Also at the event was Malaysian Transport Minister Antoni Lok.
*14:45.880- 14:51.120* :  The government here has been accused of dragging its feet in approving a new search.
*15:00.860- 15:04.360* :  He promised that a new operation was already being negotiated.
*15:04.380- 15:09.580* :  For the families of those on board, like Jakita Gonzalez, whose husband Patrick
*15:09.580- 15:15.040* :  was the in-flight supervisor on MH370, the wait for answers goes on.
*15:15.480- 15:21.980* :  I just want the plane to be found, and at least I can let my husband rest in peace.
*15:22.760- 15:26.500* :  Right now I've not done anything for him to give him a memorial.
*15:27.380- 15:33.400* :  I can't, but you know it's time that I let him be at peace.
*15:34.100- 15:37.600* :  That report compiled by Jonathan Head in Kuala Lumpur.
*15:38.660- 15:42.720* :  To India now, we're police say they have smashed a trafficking network,
*15:42.720- 15:46.100* :  which was sending people to fight for the Russian Army in Ukraine.
*15:46.700- 15:50.460* :  Authorities say 35 recruits had so far been sent to Russia,
*15:51.000- 15:53.540* :  and deaths of some of those sent have been recorded.
*15:53.980- 15:57.200* :  Our South Asia editor and Barossa and at a Russian told me more.
*15:57.800- 16:00.120* :  According to the Central Bureau of Investigation,
*16:00.120- 16:02.600* :  that is India's Federal Investigative Agency.
*16:02.600- 16:05.740* :  What they're saying is they were using social media,
*16:05.740- 16:11.680* :  putting out videos on YouTube and on Instagram, asking people to sign up,
*16:11.680- 16:13.420* :  because it is a job in Russia.
*16:13.420- 16:17.360* :  You'll be getting about $1,500 to $1,800 a month.
*16:17.360- 16:22.140* :  And some were even promised a Russian citizenship within three months of joining.
*16:22.140- 16:26.860* :  But initially, according to police, what they were told was they will be doing some
*16:26.860- 16:30.660* :  support roles, like working as a technical person,
*16:30.660- 16:35.180* :  like a carpenter or a cook or even other supportive roles.
*16:35.560- 16:37.600* :  But then after that, some of these people,
*16:37.880- 16:42.460* :  they issued a Facebook video saying that they were given weapons training,
*16:42.460- 16:44.980* :  and then asked to go near the battlefield.
*16:44.980- 16:48.980* :  And as far as we know, at least two Indians have died.
*16:49.500- 16:52.680* :  And so this is an organized network, and that's why the Indian Forces,
*16:52.680- 16:56.860* :  the Security Forces, carried out a raid across the country.
*16:56.860- 16:59.320* :  In many cities, like in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai,
*16:59.680- 17:03.880* :  and they think one of the main mastermind,
*17:03.880- 17:06.120* :  another guy who was organizing it based in Dubai,
*17:06.120- 17:08.440* :  because many people went from Dubai, so Dubai.
*17:08.440- 17:11.040* :  So that is a big issue for the authorities now.
*17:11.660- 17:14.540* :  India and Russia, of course, share close ties.
*17:15.040- 17:17.640* :  Historically, they've been very close nations.
*17:18.220- 17:19.860* :  How is Delhi dealing with this?
*17:20.320- 17:24.880* :  In fact, the story was first reported by a newspaper called the Hindu.
*17:24.880- 17:27.760* :  In fact, the Indian government was not even aware of this issue.
*17:28.160- 17:30.280* :  And then it triggered various reactions.
*17:30.280- 17:34.140* :  And today, the Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson was saying that
*17:34.740- 17:38.220* :  these people are duped into the Ukrainian border,
*17:38.220- 17:42.200* :  and they were talking with Moscow, and as and when they hear proper complaints
*17:42.200- 17:45.780* :  and get more details, they were trying to get these people back.
*17:46.780- 17:49.440* :  But then we do not know how many people have been sent.
*17:50.620- 17:53.140* :  Some estimates suggest it could be as much as 100.
*17:53.660- 17:56.380* :  And we also hear reports of people being sent from Nepal,
*17:56.380- 17:58.060* :  as well as in Sri Lanka.
*17:58.060- 18:02.460* :  So it is not simply an issue confining to India, but also across the region.
*18:02.680- 18:05.760* :  But it's quite a small number of people compared to the number of Russian troops
*18:06.240- 18:07.880* :  that are fighting in Ukraine, isn't it?
*18:08.640- 18:11.320* :  But we don't know the exact number how many people have gone.
*18:11.500- 18:13.080* :  But now the stories are emerging,
*18:13.080- 18:17.080* :  because these people are sending very desperate SOS messages to their families.
*18:17.080- 18:20.300* :  Please come and take us or complain to the Indian authorities.
*18:20.940- 18:22.680* :  We were not told that we will be fighting.
*18:22.680- 18:26.400* :  So this is a very dangerous territory where you can get killed anytime
*18:26.400- 18:30.120* :  when people did not even realize that no, they were going to go and fight in this war.
*18:30.480- 18:31.840* :  And Barassan et a Russian.
*18:34.500- 18:39.280* :  Still to come in this podcast, new reports of mass bleaching of corals

*21:01.400- 21:03.820* :  A US Congressional panel has approved a bill
*21:04.260- 21:06.920* :  that would force TikTok's parent company, Bite Dance,
*21:06.920- 21:10.340* :  which is based in China to sell the app or face a ban.
*21:10.700- 21:13.900* :  It's the latest move in an ongoing wrangle over ownership
*21:13.960- 21:16.880* :  of the massively popular social media phenomenon
*21:17.400- 21:19.620* :  as our reporter, Gelder Silva, explains.
*21:20.380- 21:24.660* :  The bill is expected to go to a full house floor vote next week.
*21:25.220- 21:28.120* :  The bill passed despite extensive law
*21:28.120- 21:30.020* :  being by TikTok against it.
*21:30.020- 21:33.080* :  The company has been in the crosshairs of lawmakers
*21:33.080- 21:35.800* :  in the United States and elsewhere since 2020
*21:35.800- 21:39.220* :  when former President Donald Trump singled it out.
*21:39.220- 21:41.760* :  The problem is TikTok's parent company,
*21:41.760- 21:45.420* :  which is a Chinese technology firm called Bite Dance.
*21:46.000- 21:48.940* :  There's concern that data owned by this company
*21:48.940- 21:53.480* :  on the 170 million users of TikTok in the US
*21:53.480- 21:54.580* :  and many more around the world.
*21:54.940- 21:58.100* :  There's concern that this data could be subjected to Chinese law.
*21:58.240- 22:00.800* :  There's also fears that TikTok could be used as a tool
*22:01.160- 22:05.040* :  to propagate, to amplify China's influence campaigns.
*22:05.100- 22:07.740* :  All of this is, of course, denied by TikTok
*22:08.000- 22:08.900* :  and by Bite Dance.
*22:08.900- 22:11.920* :  TikTok has taken steps to ensure that the data
*22:11.920- 22:13.660* :  of its users is protected.
*22:13.660- 22:15.860* :  But obviously, it hasn't been enough
*22:15.900- 22:19.020* :  to ease the concerns of the US political elite.
*22:19.600- 22:23.080* :  Gelder Silva, after years of impressive
*22:23.080- 22:26.080* :  regrowth reaching record levels in 2022,
*22:26.360- 22:27.980* :  scientists are, once again,
*22:28.500- 22:29.840* :  sounding the alarm over bleaching
*22:29.840- 22:32.980* :  at the Great Barrier Reef off the Australian coast.
*22:33.440- 22:36.040* :  Mass bleaching occurs when heat-stressed corals
*22:36.040- 22:38.720* :  expel the algae that gives them life and colour.
*22:39.020- 22:41.840* :  The El Nino effect and climate change
*22:41.840- 22:43.680* :  are being blamed for the new worries.
*22:44.080- 22:46.020* :  Simon Atkinson reports from Queensland.
*22:46.860- 22:48.680* :  Only seven mass coral bleaching events
*22:48.680- 22:50.920* :  have ever been recorded on the Great Barrier Reef.
*22:51.300- 22:53.200* :  But this is the fifth to hit in eight years.
*22:54.100- 22:55.900* :  The authority managing the Marine Park
*22:55.900- 22:58.680* :  says aerial surveys over two-thirds of the reef
*22:58.680- 23:01.860* :  confirm that a widespread, often called mass,
*23:02.120- 23:03.900* :  coral bleaching event is taking place.
*23:04.860- 23:07.340* :  There's particular concern for southern parts of the reef
*23:07.700- 23:09.980* :  which have avoided the worst of previous bleachings.
*23:10.760- 23:12.640* :  Bleached coral doesn't necessarily die,
*23:12.640- 23:15.240* :  but experts say it's more susceptible to disease
*23:15.680- 23:17.080* :  and less likely to reproduce.
*23:18.020- 23:20.820* :  Later this year, the World Heritage Committee will again consider
*23:20.820- 23:23.680* :  if the reef should be placed on a list of sites in danger
*23:24.020- 23:26.280* :  because of concerns over the impact of global heating
*23:26.720- 23:27.780* :  as well as water pollution.
*23:28.600- 23:30.680* :  Australia's government says it's doing everything it can
*23:30.680- 23:31.720* :  to protect the reef.
*23:32.280- 23:35.200* :  But environmental campaigners Greenpeace say this claim
*23:35.200- 23:38.020* :  rings hollow because the country continues to expand
*23:38.020- 23:40.160* :  and subsidise the coal and gas industry,
*23:40.640- 23:43.260* :  making it a major contributor to the climate crisis.
*23:43.780- 23:45.360* :  Simon Atkinson in Australia.
*23:46.400- 23:49.880* :  Ukraine has been experiencing setbacks in its war with Russia
*23:50.100- 23:51.980* :  and Republicans in the U.S. Congress
*23:51.980- 23:55.260* :  have been holding back billions of dollars in military aid.
*23:55.260- 23:58.280* :  But there is some potential good news for Kiev,
*23:58.280- 24:00.280* :  at least in the cultural arena.
*24:00.660- 24:03.560* :  Ukraine looks set to possibly save a moment
*24:03.560- 24:05.500* :  of Oscar's night victory.
*24:05.980- 24:07.900* :  Tom Brooke reports from Los Angeles.
*24:09.900- 24:12.460* :  39-year-old Mr. Slabchenov could bring Ukraine
*24:12.460- 24:14.060* :  an Oscar's night victory.
*24:15.360- 24:17.100* :  His film, 20 Days in Maria Pol,
*24:17.520- 24:19.460* :  is widely considered to be the favourite
*24:19.460- 24:21.760* :  to take home the best documentary feature trophy.
*24:22.700- 24:23.860* :  Someone once told me,
*24:24.640- 24:26.440* :  wars don't start with explosions.
*24:29.420- 24:30.520* :  They start with silence.
*24:32.600- 24:35.240* :  20 Days in Maria Pol is not easy to watch.
*24:35.560- 24:37.620* :  It is not a sanitised view of war.
*24:38.140- 24:40.340* :  It is footage shot by Mr. Slabchenov,
*24:40.340- 24:42.300* :  video journalist for the associated press
*24:42.300- 24:45.380* :  with his colleagues in Maria Pol in 2022
*24:45.840- 24:49.260* :  as Russian forces began to encircle a Ukrainian port city.
*24:49.860- 24:52.900* :  This film tells the story of the first 20 days of
*24:53.320- 24:55.780* :  86 days siege of Maria Pol.
*24:56.180- 24:59.880* :  Those 20 days became a symbol of how Russia
*25:02.760- 25:04.440* :  attacked Ukraine, how Russia
*25:05.020- 25:08.620* :  killed the civilians, what tactics Russia uses
*25:08.620- 25:11.180* :  to take every single city right now in Ukraine.
*25:12.320- 25:14.620* :  20 Days in Maria Pol is, in many ways,
*25:14.620- 25:17.600* :  the story of a city on the edge in its death roads.
*25:17.920- 25:20.860* :  The director brings images of the citizens of Maria Pol
*25:20.860- 25:22.440* :  in the worst moments of their lives.
*25:22.440- 25:25.580* :  You witness expectant mothers fleeing from a hospital,
*25:25.580- 25:27.860* :  the dead bodies of men, women and children.
*25:28.380- 25:30.700* :  The director captures the agonising grief
*25:31.080- 25:32.960* :  of those who just lost loved ones.
*25:33.340- 25:35.880* :  It is the full violence of war that is on view.
*25:36.140- 25:40.180* :  The filmmaker seemed to have the trust of those whose tragedy he was documenting.
*25:41.080- 25:44.820* :  How did you decide what images to include in the documentary?
*25:44.820- 25:49.800* :  Because some of the images are unbelievably difficult to watch, aren't they?
*25:50.140- 25:53.680* :  It is difficult to watch, but there is a fine balance
*25:53.680- 25:57.580* :  and it was one of the most challenging parts of making this film.
*25:58.160- 26:00.160* :  How do you treat a story?
*26:00.160- 26:04.820* :  How do you treat the visuals so that you pay respect to victims?
*26:05.700- 26:08.180* :  Because it's very important to always respect
*26:09.080- 26:11.060* :  victims of the violence at the same time,
*26:11.060- 26:14.300* :  how to not disanitise the footage,
*26:14.380- 26:20.960* :  how to keep the audience invested and feeling what it's really like to be there.
*26:24.200- 26:26.540* :  In recent days in the run-up to the Oscars,
*26:26.820- 26:28.960* :  Mr. Slav Chernoff has been here in the US
*26:28.960- 26:31.060* :  in New York and Los Angeles and elsewhere,
*26:31.560- 26:33.320* :  attending screenings of his film.
*26:33.800- 26:36.380* :  His presence here has helped bring his documentary
*26:36.380- 26:41.580* :  to the attention of Oscar voters and made it part of the Academy Awards conversation.
*26:42.880- 26:45.720* :  Academy members may also have been inclined to vote for the film
*26:45.720- 26:49.160* :  because they see it as a way of supporting Ukraine at a time
*26:49.160- 26:51.660* :  when it's been experiencing setbacks on the battlefield
*26:52.100- 26:54.740* :  and in its efforts to get military aid from the US.
*26:55.800- 27:00.060* :  But when I lose the Oscar, Mr. Slav Chernoff hopes at least one legacy of his film
*27:00.060- 27:03.340* :  is that it will provide audiences with lasting proof
*27:03.480- 27:06.340* :  of the wrongs committed by Russia against his people
*27:06.780- 27:08.600* :  that it represents something more enduring
*27:08.600- 27:10.620* :  and daily news reports from Ukraine.
*27:11.340- 27:14.260* :  One of the reasons why it was so important for me to do
*27:14.960- 27:16.420* :  to make 20 days in my viewball,
*27:16.420- 27:19.800* :  because when you watch the film, the documentary film,
*27:19.940- 27:27.820* :  it gives you enough context to make your own informed decisions on what it means.
*27:28.920- 27:31.660* :  The viewer have enough context to decide
*27:32.660- 27:36.680* :  how to interpret the images and not to be told how to interpret.
*27:37.140- 27:41.560* :  That is why the long-form films are so important right now.
*27:43.980- 27:47.360* :  Mr. Slav Chernoff says he wants his documentaries to show the world
*27:47.360- 27:51.840* :  the suffering and destruction as the war in Ukraine wages on.
*27:52.300- 27:56.100* :  The Oscar nomination has certainly been bringing attention to his country's plight
*27:56.540- 28:01.420* :  as critical today as it was when he first began documenting the siege of Maria Pol
*28:01.740- 28:02.400* :  two years ago.
*28:05.280- 28:06.640* :  Tom Brook in Los Angeles.
*28:07.660- 28:10.380* :  March 8th is International Women's Day.
*28:10.520- 28:14.200* :  It's an event marked around the world with women taking to the streets
*28:14.200- 28:17.120* :  and demanding action on issues such as equal pay,
*28:17.120- 28:19.200* :  reproductive rights and education.
*28:19.720- 28:24.120* :  This year's theme is inspired inclusion to encourage people to speak out
*28:24.500- 28:26.960* :  against discrimination, challenge stereotypes
*28:27.640- 28:28.980* :  and try to overcome prejudice.
*28:29.400- 28:31.260* :  Stephanie Prentice has this report.
*28:32.100- 28:37.180* :  International Women's Day is a time to reflect on the progress women have made around the world,
*28:37.600- 28:42.200* :  looking at economic opportunity, education, health and political leadership.
*28:42.840- 28:45.960* :  Events have already been taking place in the Southern Hemisphere
*28:45.960- 28:51.480* :  in Australia, the home of one of the most famous feminist speeches in recent history.
*28:51.760- 28:55.700* :  If he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia,
*28:55.700- 28:58.860* :  he doesn't need emotion in the House of Representatives.
*28:59.360- 29:00.460* :  He needs a mirror.
*29:00.960- 29:02.660* :  Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard,
*29:02.660- 29:05.760* :  speaking for your position, need a Tony Abbott in 2012
*29:06.400- 29:08.360* :  and one group of women in Bondi Beach
*29:08.360- 29:12.040* :  have been holding an event to raise awareness of how women's roles have changed
*29:12.520- 29:14.880* :  training the next generation of lifesavers.
*29:17.200- 29:19.420* :  Lifesaving was like in 1907
*29:19.920- 29:24.060* :  and then women were allowed to become lifesavers in 1980.
*29:24.700- 29:26.120* :  So we're making up for lost time.
*29:28.240- 29:31.720* :  Across Southeast Asia, hundreds of women have been demonstrating.
*29:32.600- 29:38.440* :  These women in the Philippine capital Manila held signs and shouted slogans asking for equal rights.
*29:39.780- 29:44.820* :  In Bangkok, protesters dress like pregnant laborers marched in front of the democracy monument
*29:45.840- 29:50.760* :  and in Indonesia activists gathered in front of the election agency building in Jakarta.
*29:51.820- 29:55.220* :  Meanwhile in China, one group of women are highlighting women's role
*29:55.220- 29:57.920* :  in strength sports like boxing and weightlifting,
*29:58.360- 30:01.440* :  as an emblem of rejecting societal views that women there
