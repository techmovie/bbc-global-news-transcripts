*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:19.260* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Alex Richardson,
*00:19.260- 00:24.260* :  and in the early hours of Thursday, the 28th of March, these are our main stories.
*00:24.920- 00:30.000* :  And about turn by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on canceling talks with the White
*00:30.000- 00:35.620* :  House over plans to attack Raffa in Gaza. Now we're told, you can't do this, if you're going to
*00:35.620- 00:41.480* :  laugh or you're going to have a humanitarian catastrophe, 20,000. So, billion debt, that is simply not
*00:41.480- 00:47.380* :  true. A billion meals worldwide are thrown away every day, according to the United Nations,
*00:47.380- 00:53.800* :  and Myanmar's military is accused of using social media that resulted in mass attacks on ethnic
*00:53.800- 01:00.480* :  rehinges. It was a really violent, chilling time. The UN has now said it's a textbook example
*01:00.480- 01:07.160* :  of ethnic cleansing. Also, in this podcast, I was walking out of class,
*01:07.160- 01:11.920* :  sending a text to a friend, and then just got clocked in the face. Just texted my friends,
*01:12.080- 01:16.100* :  just got punched in the face, and then they sent me a text on this other girl in New York,
*01:16.100- 01:22.020* :  who got punched in the face. A disturbing uptake in women being physically assaulted in New York,
*01:22.440- 01:28.840* :  and fury in France over the resignation of a head teacher who got death threats for enforcing the
*01:28.840- 01:38.420* :  compulsory ban on Islamic headscars. Just days after the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*01:38.420- 01:44.300* :  canceled a visit to Washington by some of his top officials, he's changed his mind. He took the
*01:44.300- 01:49.780* :  original decision on Monday, after the United States appeared to turn its back on Israel by not
*01:49.780- 01:54.780* :  blocking a United Nations Security Council resolution, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
*01:55.240- 02:00.240* :  The visit by Israeli officials is to discuss a planned military offensive against Hamas
*02:00.580- 02:05.240* :  in Rafa, the U.S. has warned against the operation because of the humanitarian cost.
*02:05.240- 02:09.760* :  That view was reiterated by the State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.
*02:10.200- 02:15.960* :  A full-scale military operation into Rafa would be a mistake, and it's not something that we can
*02:15.960- 02:20.720* :  support. What we have said is the kind of mission that we could support is a much more
*02:21.360- 02:25.820* :  targeted, limited campaign that could still achieve the same objectives, that could still
*02:25.820- 02:32.800* :  lead to the defeat of those remaining Hamas battalions inside Rafa, but without massive harm to
*02:32.800- 02:36.440* :  the civilian population, without hindering the delivery of humanitarian assistance.
*02:36.920- 02:42.360* :  In Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu brushed aside worries about potentially huge numbers of
*02:42.360- 02:48.260* :  civilian deaths. Victory is within reach. It's a few weeks away. This is it, last point.
*02:49.420- 02:53.520* :  Now we are told, you can't do this. If you're going to Rafa, you're going to have a humanitarian
*02:53.520- 03:01.960* :  catastrophe. You're going to have, I don't know, 30,000-30,000 civilian dead. Okay, that's not true.
*03:02.620- 03:07.720* :  That is simply not true. So what was it that prompted Mr. Netanyahu to change his mind,
*03:07.820- 03:13.140* :  correspondent in Jerusalem, is Hugo Bashager? I think what is interesting is that after
*03:13.140- 03:18.980* :  Prime Minister Netanyahu cancelled the visit on Monday, the White House said it was an overreaction.
*03:18.980- 03:24.200* :  The Israeli Defense Minister Yohav Galant had meetings in Washington this week.
*03:24.200- 03:29.380* :  Senior American officials said those meetings were productive. So perhaps this
*03:29.680- 03:35.240* :  you turn by the Prime Minister is the result of those meetings. But I think what's been
*03:35.240- 03:40.180* :  quite clear here is the growing frustration and the Biden administration with the way
*03:40.180- 03:46.440* :  Israel has been conducting this war. And I think the feeling that Israel is not listening to
*03:46.440- 03:51.520* :  the concerns that have been shared by its closest ally. The Americans are saying, look,
*03:51.520- 03:56.600* :  too many Palestinians have been killed and that more needs to be done to step up the delivery
*03:56.600- 04:02.880* :  of humanitarian aid amid warnings of famine in parts of Gaza. But we haven't really seen
*04:02.880- 04:08.640* :  any dramatic change in the Israeli strategy. The talks are about a possible offensive in
*04:08.640- 04:13.760* :  Raffa. The US wants to see clear plans first. What more do you know? Yeah, so essentially what
*04:13.760- 04:19.820* :  Prime Minister Netanyahu says is that the Israeli military must enter Raffa to defeat Hamas.
*04:19.820- 04:25.220* :  This is where the Israeli say four Hamas battalions remain operational.
*04:25.820- 04:31.700* :  The problem, of course, is that this is the last relatively safe place in Gaza where more than
*04:31.700- 04:37.820* :  one million Palestinians are sheltering after being forced to flee their homes. And the Israeli say
*04:37.820- 04:43.880* :  they have a plan to safely evacuate civilians. But I guess virtually everyone outside Israel
*04:43.880- 04:49.280* :  opposes the idea of a major incursion into Raffa. The UN is saying that this will lead to a
*04:49.560- 04:54.480* :  humanitarian catastrophe, something that Netanyahu talked about in the clip. The Americans say
*04:54.480- 04:59.560* :  this will lead to a disaster. So the Americans are saying they have alternatives to a major
*04:59.560- 05:04.280* :  incursion in that they want to discuss these possibilities with the Israelis. So is it going to happen?
*05:04.680- 05:07.920* :  Well, we still don't know. The Prime Minister is adamant that this is going to
*05:08.300- 05:13.080* :  go ahead, that this is the only way to defeat Hamas. You go, Bashaegar, in Jerusalem.
*05:14.340- 05:21.060* :  How much food gets wasted worldwide each day? The equivalent of one billion meals a day,
*05:21.060- 05:26.740* :  according to a new report by the United Nations. The organization says it's a global tragedy that
*05:26.740- 05:33.680* :  we waste almost one-fifth of the food we produce at a time when almost 800 million people face
*05:33.680- 05:39.520* :  chronic hunger. Gaza is one such place where one million people are on the brink of famine. Nigeria
*05:39.520- 05:45.180* :  is also battling food insecurity as Africa's largest economy is gripped by high inflation
*05:45.180- 05:52.080* :  pushing millions into poverty. Among them is 68-year-old Damalola Salami. She spoke outside of food
*05:52.080- 06:02.180* :  banking legos. There's nothing for us to eat. We are hungry. Our children are out of school because
*06:02.180- 06:07.920* :  of the hike in fees. Now the children are at home and we have nothing to feed them. Please have mercy.
*06:11.700- 06:16.800* :  But who is responsible and is it a trend that can be reversed? I spoke to our environment
*06:16.800- 06:22.960* :  correspondent Matt McGraw. The driving forces behind what's causing this food waste is a growing
*06:22.960- 06:27.140* :  element of this which is not just the richer countries wasting lots of food, but it's also
*06:27.140- 06:32.000* :  developing countries wasting lots of food as well. A global problem that doesn't seem to be getting
*06:32.000- 06:36.300* :  better and you might have thought with global populations growing up, then getting larger,
*06:36.300- 06:40.180* :  then effectively we'd be wasting less food, but it doesn't seem to be the case. We're wasting
*06:40.180- 06:44.600* :  massive amounts of food and it's having huge impacts, not just on nature and on pollution,
*06:44.600- 06:50.080* :  but on the climate as well. The estimation is that about 8-10% of global emissions come from
*06:50.420- 06:55.360* :  wasting food. It's crazy in some respects. If food waste was a country, it would be the third
*06:55.360- 06:59.940* :  biggest emitter behind the US and China just to put it in context for people. So it's an
*06:59.940- 07:04.320* :  obvious problem. There's lots of things that people talk about wanting to do about it and
*07:04.320- 07:09.640* :  some things are being done. We see in richer countries there are greater efforts to improve
*07:09.640- 07:15.700* :  refrigeration, not to have so much waste, to cut down on best before dates and other warnings about
*07:15.700- 07:20.200* :  expiry dates that our manufacturers are trying to get rid of those in many places. In developing
*07:20.200- 07:23.900* :  countries there's greater efforts at refrigeration because that's where the big losses are,
*07:23.900- 07:29.980* :  the lack of refrigeration, a lot of food waste lost in transit as well. So there's various ways
*07:29.980- 07:35.000* :  of tackling this problem, but the problem still seems to be ongoing. The researcher said,
*07:35.320- 07:39.220* :  the more we look at this problem, the more we discover about it and the more food we see is being
*07:39.220- 07:43.780* :  wasted. And this is one of those rare problems where all of us can actually do something about it.
*07:44.620- 07:48.960* :  Yeah, absolutely. I think the first thing that the UN says about this is that really if countries
*07:48.960- 07:53.940* :  start to count how much is wasted, they can really then start to make some progress. Only about
*07:53.940- 07:59.380* :  20 countries count food waste in their climate plans to cut down on climate change and that
*07:59.380- 08:04.100* :  is possible to make changes. Richard countries like the UK and Japan have cut down food waste
*08:05.020- 08:09.620* :  significantly, Japan down by about a third in the last few years by putting in place better
*08:09.620- 08:15.360* :  plans, but it's a real challenge. Food is cheap in many countries and there's no real penalties
*08:15.360- 08:20.160* :  for people throwing it away. And that unfortunately, despite so many people going hungry,
*08:20.160- 08:24.860* :  is the tragedy of the situation. Matt McGraw. Hates,
*08:24.860- 08:30.100* :  Presidential Council has promised to restore public order and democracy once it's installed,
*08:30.100- 08:34.720* :  which is expected to happen in the next few days. In its first official statement,
*08:34.720- 08:39.480* :  the Council said it would appoint a new Prime Minister to organize presidential and congressional
*08:39.480- 08:45.280* :  elections, which are long overdue. Illegal weapons from abroad are fueling the gun violence.
*08:45.280- 08:49.780* :  The United Nations has warned that arms trafficking, particularly from the US,
*08:50.220- 08:53.780* :  has powered the gangs who've taken over, displacing thousands of people.
*08:54.220- 08:57.940* :  Our correspondent Nomiya Ikbal sent this report from Cappation.
*09:00.640- 09:06.380* :  The capital of this volatile nation is a war zone. For a country that doesn't manufacture weapons,
*09:06.380- 09:12.700* :  every type of gun is flooding porcelain prints, high-powered rifles such as AK-47s,
*09:12.740- 09:20.340* :  9mm pistols, sniper rifles, belt-fed machine guns, it's the main cause of a staggering surge
*09:20.540- 09:22.480* :  in Haiti's gang-related violence.
*09:28.740- 09:33.780* :  Juliette has faced that violence first hand. She used to work as a party planner in
*09:33.800- 09:37.700* :  Prusa Prince, an event she had catered for was ambushed by gangs.
*09:37.960- 09:45.660* :  I said to everyone, one, one, one, because they are shooting and then I was shot twice.
*09:49.900- 09:52.660* :  Juliette shows me the bullet scars on her arm and chest.
*09:56.700- 10:02.860* :  She sobs, as she recalls how 10 people were killed, including her 22-year-old business partner.
*10:05.380- 10:08.500* :  She fled to Cappation carrying her suitcase and scars.
*10:08.860- 10:15.340* :  At the beginning, our political leaders didn't do anything to stop these gangs.
*10:15.800- 10:17.020* :  The gangs are everywhere.
*10:17.680- 10:21.460* :  The 50-year-old now lives in a small space, sharing a bed with a friend.
*10:22.280- 10:25.500* :  She can't go back to her home because gangs have news in.
*10:25.900- 10:30.100* :  Cappation is the only safe place I know of in Haiti right now.
*10:33.340- 10:37.360* :  That safe haven is why buses keep coming into Cappation every day,
*10:37.360- 10:40.580* :  braving the dangerous drive along gang-controlled roads.
*10:41.460- 10:45.320* :  More than 30,000 people have desperately fled the violence in the capital,
*10:45.900- 10:48.400* :  paying high prices to make the journey here.
*10:50.260- 10:55.300* :  There is a moment of relief, as one father sees his 14-year-old son climb down the stairs
*10:55.300- 10:57.640* :  with his bag. David is safe.
*11:00.200- 11:03.020* :  The journey was very long, more than six hours.
*11:03.020- 11:08.300* :  I was praying the whole way. There were a lot of gunshots in one area.
*11:08.780- 11:10.180* :  Our bus just missed them.
*11:10.840- 11:13.440* :  People on the bus are exhausted and upset.
*11:14.360- 11:16.800* :  One man says he has a message for America.
*11:19.740- 11:22.340* :  All the gangs here are from the US.
*11:23.000- 11:26.540* :  If the US want to stop this, they could do it in one month.
*11:27.480- 11:31.320* :  There is no exact number for how many traffic firearms are currently in Haiti,
*11:31.320- 11:35.780* :  a UN report in January said some estimates put it at half a billion
*11:35.780- 11:38.960* :  legal and illegal weapons here as of 2020.
*11:39.580- 11:43.180* :  It's 50 guns for every person living in a country
*11:43.180- 11:46.200* :  with a population of just over 11 million.
*11:46.720- 11:50.560* :  The US State Department announced a plan last year to work with Haitian police
*11:50.560- 11:54.240* :  to tackle gun trafficking, but there is no head of state right now,
*11:54.240- 11:58.760* :  effectively no government, and yet to be announced presidential transitional council,
*11:58.760- 12:01.740* :  that's already been viewed by many people here with suspicion.
*12:02.480- 12:08.540* :  It means gun violence is yet another vicious circle Haiti is trapped in with no clear way out.
*12:12.720- 12:18.140* :  The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, has accused Russia of lying in its attempts
*12:18.140- 12:21.500* :  to link last week's attack on a concert hall in Moscow to Ukraine.
*12:21.500- 12:26.000* :  The comments come after the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko,
*12:26.420- 12:29.900* :  said the attackers had tried to flee to his country first,
*12:30.340- 12:33.360* :  rather than head straight to Ukraine, as the Kremlin had suggested,
*12:33.940- 12:37.520* :  eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford has more details.
*12:38.420- 12:42.280* :  The comments by Alexander Lukashenko throw direct doubt on Russia's claims
*12:42.340- 12:45.640* :  that Ukraine was somehow involved in the Kroka city attack.
*12:46.440- 12:50.480* :  Speaking to state media, the Belarusian leader said as soon as his country's security
*12:50.480- 12:53.600* :  service knew that the gunmen were fleeing west from Moscow,
*12:54.160- 12:56.220* :  Russia asked Belarus to close the border.
*12:56.920- 12:59.700* :  Mr. Lukashenko says the attackers then realized they couldn't cross,
*12:59.700- 13:05.420* :  so headed for Ukraine instead. The problem is that's nothing like Vladimir Putin's story,
*13:05.420- 13:11.000* :  that Ukraine had supposedly opened a window on its own border for the attackers to escape through.
*13:11.640- 13:14.720* :  Officials in Kiev have called that claim absurd from the very start,
*13:15.220- 13:16.980* :  and Russia has never produced any evidence.
*13:17.760- 13:22.300* :  But even today, the foreign ministry spokeswoman in Moscow tried to undermine the fact that the
*13:22.300- 13:26.940* :  so-called Islamic state group has said it carried out this attack, by saying it was hard to
*13:26.940- 13:32.560* :  believe ISIS would have had the capacity. That is classic Russian style, to muddy the waters,
*13:33.040- 13:38.220* :  make unsubstantiated claims, and try to deflect all possible criticism from Vladimir Putin.
*13:39.160- 13:43.180* :  In fact, that's what the Belarusian leader claimed he was trying to do with his own comments.
*13:43.640- 13:47.700* :  He wanted people to know how busy the two presidents had been in the wake of the attack,
*13:47.700- 13:53.440* :  coordinating their response. Instead, he's undermined Vladimir Putin's whole story.
*13:54.280- 14:00.800* :  Maybe it was a blunder, maybe not. Alexander Lukashenko sometimes likes to remind Moscow that he's
*14:00.800- 14:08.120* :  no one's puppet. Sarah Rainsford. The almost year-long conflict that's been raging in Sudan has
*14:08.120- 14:13.360* :  left tens of thousands dead and displaced more than seven million people, the highest number
*14:13.760- 14:18.540* :  in the world. With the help of outside support, it's pitted the Sudanese army under General
*14:18.540- 14:25.820* :  Berhan against General Hymati of the Rapid Support Forces or RSF. Now, the Sudanese army has
*14:25.820- 14:32.220* :  ordered the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to leave over its alleged support for the RSF.
*14:32.600- 14:37.840* :  John Prendergastko founded the investigative and policy organization called the Century,
*14:37.840- 14:44.360* :  with Hollywood A. Lister George Clooney. He explained how Sudan's rapid support forces have been
*14:44.360- 14:51.280* :  using gold to fund its war to Julian Marshall. They have been exporting most of their gold,
*14:51.280- 14:58.000* :  particularly from Darfur, into the United Arab Emirates gold markets for years now. So when the
*14:58.000- 15:03.940* :  split occurred between the government and the militia, they continued to export their gold to
*15:03.940- 15:10.660* :  the Emirates. And basically, there's an unholy triangle between the RSF Wagner group, now called
*15:10.660- 15:17.100* :  the Africa Corps, the Russia's paramilitary organization, and the Emirati gold traders to
*15:17.100- 15:23.960* :  blonder Sudanese gold through the Emirates markets and much of the cash then goes back to Russia
*15:24.340- 15:29.200* :  to help fund its war in Ukraine. And some of the money, of course, comes to the RSF.
*15:29.720- 15:35.480* :  And does it work in the same way from territory controlled by General Behan and the Sudanese army?
*15:35.720- 15:40.140* :  We're still trying to get a full handle on that, but it seems like a lot of the gold that Egypt is
*15:40.140- 15:45.880* :  bringing in is being smuggled across the border from Sudanese government controlled territory
*15:45.880- 15:52.720* :  into Egypt and then Egypt monetizes that, sells it in international markets. So probably through Dubai.
*15:52.720- 15:57.680* :  So yeah, they're getting it from a different source, but most of it actually ends up going through
*15:57.680- 16:05.280* :  through the gold markets in Dubai. And this illegal gold trade could in your view be stopped?
*16:05.920- 16:10.920* :  Stopped would be too extreme, but I think it certainly could be undermined and could be
*16:10.920- 16:17.820* :  countered. Part of it is just public pressure. If we look back, say, 20 years when the genocide erupted
*16:17.820- 16:25.880* :  in Darfur, no less a power is China had its policy impacted by accusations of funding and supporting
*16:25.880- 16:31.140* :  a genocide in Darfur. Well, now we're back again to a genocidal violence in Darfur,
*16:31.560- 16:36.540* :  and now it's the United Arab Emirates, that is the funder of the group that is responsible for that.
*16:36.920- 16:42.200* :  The Secretary General of the Goldsmiths Union in the UAE Atav Ahmed has confirmed ongoing
*16:42.200- 16:48.860* :  shipments to the UAE and the processing of others. So there is an acknowledgement by the UAE that
*16:48.860- 16:57.600* :  gold is entering the territory, but it also adds this is the governmental level that the UAE does
*16:57.600- 17:04.520* :  not take sides in the current conflict, and you would rebut that. I might, but more importantly,
*17:04.520- 17:11.620* :  the UN panel of experts focused on these issues, provided evidence, and many other sources have
*17:11.620- 17:18.280* :  confirmed and reconfirmed the various means by which the Emirates have delivered weapons to the RSF.
*17:18.680- 17:22.680* :  It's a fairly well-established fact, despite their denies.

*17:37.080- 17:42.580* :  Bruce Springsteen is set to become the first foreigner to be inducted as a fellow of the UK's
*17:42.620- 17:44.180* :  prestigious Iverse Academy.
*17:53.240- 17:58.780* :  A United Nations report has found clear evidence that the military authorities in Myanmar used
*17:58.780- 18:04.840* :  social media to spread fear and hatred for the Rohingya minority ahead of the crackdown against
*18:04.840- 18:09.900* :  them in 2017. Asia-Pacific Regional Editor Celia Hatton told me more.
*18:10.320- 18:18.360* :  What the Myanmar military, sickeningly called clearance operations, took place in August 2017.
*18:19.020- 18:27.140* :  That's when there was a massive crackdown on ethnic group inside Myanmar, Muslim Rohingyas,
*18:27.720- 18:34.960* :  tensions have long been really high between the governing military and the Rohingyas who live in
*18:34.960- 18:44.920* :  Rakhine State. In August 2017, violence really picked up. We now believe seven to 10,000 people were
*18:44.920- 18:50.980* :  killed in about a month. Tens of thousands of people were raped and tortured and hundreds of
*18:50.980- 18:58.640* :  thousands of Rohingyas fled and went to neighboring Bangladesh. It was a really violent chilling
*18:58.640- 19:05.140* :  time. The UN has now said it's a textbook example of ethnic cleansing took place at that time.
*19:05.140- 19:10.440* :  Those people who fled to Bangladesh are still in Bangladesh, still in refugee camps. What's this
*19:10.440- 19:16.240* :  UN report saying about the use of social media by the Myanmar military? Well, Facebook is uniquely
*19:16.240- 19:21.300* :  popular in Myanmar. Most people in Myanmar use it if they have access to the internet.
*19:21.880- 19:28.400* :  And so they looked at 43 Facebook pages between those months, July and December, tens of thousands
*19:28.400- 19:34.540* :  of posts. And what they've realized is that there was a secret covert network run by the military,
*19:34.540- 19:41.360* :  all written by the military, anonymous posts, all promoting hatred of the Rohingya and promoting
*19:41.360- 19:47.280* :  false allegations that the Rohingya threatened ethnic groups inside Myanmar and Buddhism itself.
*19:47.420- 19:54.200* :  Some of these posts were on celebrity gossip pages, news pages, but actually it was this covert
*19:54.200- 20:01.320* :  network with the UN says all written by the military. Celia Hatton. Women in New York City are
*20:01.320- 20:06.320* :  encouraging each other to be vigilant after reports of some being punched in the street.
*20:06.320- 20:11.620* :  Multiple incidents have happened within days of each other and the victims have been posting their
*20:11.620- 20:18.520* :  stories on TikTok. Stephanie Prentice reports. The incident started being reported on the 19th of March
*20:18.520- 20:24.260* :  when the comedian Sarah Harvard was walking alone in Lower Manhattan and was suddenly punched in
*20:24.260- 20:30.440* :  the back of her head. In the following days, multiple young women on TikTok started uploading videos
*20:30.440- 20:36.440* :  with a very similar story. They were walking alone, distracted on their smartphone,
*20:36.540- 20:40.820* :  and suddenly hit in the head by a man who quickly ran away.
*20:41.380- 20:48.940* :  I'm like shaking trying to tell this story. I was walking out of the Times Square station
*20:48.940- 20:55.300* :  and a random man came up and punched me in the head. I was like walking out of class,
*20:55.300- 21:00.980* :  sending a text to a friend and then just got clocked in the face. Oh my god, it hurts so back.
*21:01.460- 21:05.200* :  I can't even talk. I fell to the ground and now this trying to say,
*21:05.260- 21:10.980* :  I just texted my friends being like, hi, I just got punched in the face and then they sent me a
*21:10.980- 21:15.580* :  TikTok of this other girl in New York who got punched in the face and I don't know if this is
*21:15.580- 21:20.500* :  like a thing that's going around. That was part of a group of women that got punched.
*21:21.960- 21:26.400* :  What? Some accounts also claimed that the man greeted them before attacking,
*21:26.400- 21:31.680* :  with many of them reporting the incidents around downtown Manhattan in the Lower East Side,
*21:31.680- 21:36.280* :  East Village and Union Square areas. Their injuries include head wounds,
*21:36.280- 21:41.520* :  black eyes and concussions. The women have been sharing information with each other
*21:41.520- 21:46.980* :  about the attacker's description. I have been able to identify that this man is the same
*21:46.980- 21:51.700* :  as who hit a couple other girls, but what's even scarier is like there's a lot of girls
*21:51.700- 21:55.820* :  and our descriptions of this man are completely different, meaning this like there's multiple
*21:55.820- 22:00.460* :  men going around and doing this. The victims say they've all now spoken to the police after
*22:00.460- 22:06.560* :  seeing each other's stories and an investigation is underway, but they're warning other women that
*22:06.560- 22:12.140* :  in their words, as well as being cautious at night, they now need to be cautious in broad daylight.
*22:12.820- 22:17.940* :  Stephanie Prentice. Politicians in France have expressed their solidarity with a
*22:17.940- 22:23.260* :  Paris head teacher who resigned after he said he received death threats for asking students
*22:23.260- 22:28.920* :  to remove their Islamic head coverings. In an interview on French television, the Prime Minister
*22:29.240- 22:34.400* :  Gabrielle Atal said the French state would always stand with officials who are facing breaches
*22:34.400- 22:40.120* :  of secularism in educational establishments and it would pursue legal action against a pupil
*22:40.120- 22:44.880* :  about the allegations. Paris correspondent Hugh Scofield told me more.
*22:45.740- 22:50.940* :  It was about a month ago in this big secondary school in eastern Paris and the head teacher,
*22:50.940- 22:55.480* :  we don't know his name, came across three teenage girls who were wearing the Islamic headscarf,
*22:55.480- 23:00.540* :  that's against the law in France. In state schools, you have to remove any ostentatious
*23:00.540- 23:06.000* :  sign of religious affiliation. So he told them to take them off to them agreed, but one girl didn't
*23:06.100- 23:11.980* :  and there was some kind of row altercation, after which the head teacher started getting death threats.
*23:11.980- 23:17.340* :  There was a kind of online hate campaign targeting him, threatening him with killing him.
*23:17.600- 23:24.540* :  And he has decided now that he needs to resign, that his life has become too much at threat.
*23:24.580- 23:27.940* :  And it seems like it's early retirement, he's obviously getting close to the age of retirement
*23:27.940- 23:32.100* :  and the education ministry is putting that spin and it's saying yes, he's decided for his own
*23:32.100- 23:37.200* :  reasons to step down early. But in his email to fellow staff members, he says quite clearly I'm
*23:37.200- 23:41.040* :  doing this for my own safety and for the safety of the school. So as far as the kind of body
*23:41.040- 23:45.140* :  politic of France is concerned, it's a case of a senior educationalist, a head teacher,
*23:45.140- 23:51.280* :  respect with the longies of service, being forced to leave his job because of an online campaign
*23:51.280- 23:56.960* :  of hate threatening him with death. Politics is so divisive generally at the moment in France,
*23:56.960- 24:02.620* :  but as I understand it, this is pretty much united all parties. Yeah, it is doubly sensitive
*24:02.620- 24:08.000* :  because we have a track record here of attacks on teachers. There are two very well-known and
*24:08.000- 24:12.540* :  terrible cases that recent years of teachers been killed by islamists. The most notably,
*24:12.540- 24:17.560* :  of course, Samuel Patti, who had his head cut off Paris-Server by an islamist because he'd
*24:17.940- 24:23.060* :  shown cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his class. So that is why there is such sensitivity
*24:23.060- 24:27.640* :  among the teaching profession and I think that communicates itself across the country. There was
*24:27.640- 24:32.600* :  a demonstration of fellow head teachers in support of this head teacher just a couple of weeks ago
*24:32.600- 24:37.860* :  before he resigned and the message from these collected head teachers from Paris was we are all
*24:37.860- 24:42.780* :  to some degree or another facing this kind of issue all the time. Maybe not as explicit as this,
*24:43.180- 24:47.560* :  but it's happening and it's getting worse. And so, yes, on the political front, everyone has
*24:47.560- 24:52.500* :  condemned what's happening because of shocking state of affairs when a man whose job it is to
*24:52.760- 24:59.200* :  oversee a school and to make sure that he galleatay, that means keeping religion out of schools,
*24:59.200- 25:04.020* :  that these rules are applied and he was applying them, that he then has to give up because he's
*25:04.020- 25:11.420* :  under the threat of murder. He is Gofield in Paris. Tourism accounts for roughly half of the tiny
*25:11.420- 25:17.860* :  Pacific island nation of Palau's total GDP during Covid, that industry was shattered and Palau
*25:17.860- 25:24.180* :  lost around a fifth of its GDP, things are slightly recovering, but Palau is still struggling to
*25:24.180- 25:29.540* :  restart its flight routes with key tourism markets as the BBC's Frey Lindsay discovered.
*25:32.680- 25:38.280* :  This is the MK Hotel and Restaurant on Malachal Island in Palau, a small island nation in
*25:38.280- 25:43.160* :  Micronesia in the Western Pacific Ocean. Tyler Shin is the owner. We have our own private
*25:43.160- 25:49.200* :  beach looking at the kind of beach that looks like you would see on a postcard, gleaming blue water
*25:49.200- 25:54.560* :  and an amazing view. The hotel was established in 2014 after Tyler left his native career.
*25:54.700- 26:01.060* :  I live to the island life, very peaceful, just everybody like, friendly with a smile, my dream.
*26:01.060- 26:06.580* :  Tyler specialises in diving tours and before the pandemic he catered mostly to Korean clients,
*26:06.620- 26:11.280* :  but of course Covid changed all of that. It's been several years since the pandemic,
*26:11.280- 26:16.060* :  and in Palau, a country of under 20,000 people and nearly a thousand kilometres from its nearest
*26:16.060- 26:21.540* :  neighbours, tourism operators like Tyler are still waiting for a full recovery. In 2019,
*26:21.540- 26:27.940* :  Palau received around 90,000 tourists. In 2022, less than 10,000. Driving around the main island
*26:27.940- 26:31.540* :  of Coror, my taxi driver Daniel told me how things had changed.
*26:31.720- 26:36.820* :  Did you drive a lot of tourists or mostly locals? Did you have more tourists before?
*26:37.100- 26:40.560* :  Before Panthenic? Yeah, it was a better then. Yeah, of course, it was really good.
*26:41.600- 26:45.820* :  There used to be four direct flights from Korea per week, but now Koreans typically have to go
*26:45.820- 26:50.760* :  through Taiwan, and the extra travel time is putting off a lot of people. The tourism minister,
*26:50.760- 26:55.620* :  Nierai Balas Batul, told me he's been working with various countries, including Korea,
*26:56.140- 27:00.580* :  to try to get regular flights up and running again. But the problem is that given Palau's size,
*27:00.580- 27:05.060* :  it's low on a lot of carriers' priorities. As soon as they started flying out,
*27:05.100- 27:11.720* :  they wanted to start with the bigger markets. Obviously, Koreans, Japan is one of the number one
*27:11.720- 27:16.260* :  destinations, and you got Singapore, then you got Europe. We are typically at the end of that
*27:16.260- 27:21.260* :  sort of discussion. Flight and arrivals have been picking up slowly, but many tourism operators
*27:21.260- 27:26.360* :  are wary of letting too many people back in at once and seeing their precious natural resources
*27:26.360- 27:32.100* :  get used up. It's a mentality that's enshrined in the Palau Pledge, which every visitor signs in
*27:32.100- 27:37.560* :  their passport, when they arrive at Kuroa International Airport. The children of Palau,
*27:37.700- 27:42.620* :  I take this pledge as your guest to preserve and protect your beautiful and unique island line.
*27:43.480- 27:48.600* :  Ivory Voigt is a Palau and sustainable tourism consultant. We talked about how lots of the
*27:48.600- 27:53.300* :  tour operators I spoke to in Palau told me they wanted to see tourism done in a managed way,
*27:53.300- 27:57.080* :  even at the expense of revenue. She says it comes down to the culture.
*27:57.360- 28:03.740* :  The desire for more money is not necessarily the primal driver for us as Palauans to succeed in
*28:03.740- 28:09.400* :  business. That's why maybe we're not kind of thinking about this endless growth model of tourism.
*28:09.840- 28:15.280* :  Tourism Minister Matul says he's pursuing strategies of spreading out tourism around the islands,
*28:15.380- 28:20.420* :  while at the same time trying to create different strata of tourism services to bring in more
*28:20.420- 28:25.480* :  revenue without increasing potentially ruinous footfall. If I were to explain it like a plane,
*28:25.600- 28:30.820* :  for many years we've had a lot of economy seats, and what we want to do is build a more robust
*28:30.860- 28:37.000* :  tourism product where we've got some business and a lot of first-class seats. That's the challenge
*28:37.000- 28:42.340* :  we're going through now is how do we develop experiences that are meaningful to that segment,
*28:42.340- 28:46.980* :  and yet maintain a fixed number of tourists and maximize our revenues.
*28:47.680- 28:52.380* :  Neyri Valas-Matul ending that report by Frey Lindsay in Palau.
*28:53.420- 28:57.520* :  Now time for the boss, not the literal one, but this one.
*29:18.780- 29:25.660* :  The unmistakable sound of Bruce Springsteen in just a few of the American songwriters numerous hits.
*29:25.660- 29:34.200* :  He sold more than 140 million records, 120 grammars and Oscar Atoni, and last year he was honoured
*29:34.200- 29:40.480* :  with the National Medal of Arts by President Joe Biden. Now he's about to make history by becoming
*29:40.480- 29:47.320* :  the first international songwriter to be awarded a UK Ivers Academy Fellowship. He joins
*29:47.320- 29:53.720* :  Elton John, Paul McCartney, Joan Armitraiding and Kate Bush in winning the prestigious prize.
*29:53.720- 29:59.680* :  Julian Marshall spoke to the journalist Matt Charlton about what this award would mean for Springsteen.
*30:00.240- 30:05.320* :  The UK has always been a very big supporter of Bruce Springsteen. It doesn't really take off
*30:05.340- 30:09.660* :  for him straight away in the USA. It took until his third album Born to Run.
*30:09.840- 30:13.020* :  For it thinks to really kick him from there, but he made his name on the live circuit,
*30:13.020- 30:18.180* :  and that included the UK, and like so many artists before and since the American artist,
*30:18.180- 30:22.720* :  he went over to the UK and cut his teeth and got a really strong following, so it should mean
*30:22.720- 30:29.060* :  quite a lot to him. Because the citation reads his impact on the UK's cultural landscape.
*30:29.060- 30:33.820* :  How would you measure that? He's always spoken to the blue collar worker, which of course is a very
*30:34.000- 30:38.100* :  American expression, but it hits in the same way here with the working class. It's about that
*30:38.100- 30:44.000* :  struggle, it's about being ignored, it's about losing Elton, still seeing the romance in the rough
*30:44.000- 30:50.060* :  edges, and he really calls a lot of people together, the epistemic of it, and distilled down into one
*30:50.060- 30:53.040* :  lyric as tramps like us, baby, we were born to run.
*31:01.700- 31:08.460* :  And the two sides of what he does, the downtrodden and the overlooks in the tramps like us,
*31:08.500- 31:12.840* :  and then there were romance that comes with, we were born to run, we're going to soar anyway,
*31:12.840- 31:18.940* :  and that really encapsulates it. I'm going to be talking about the US UK connection, but globally,
*31:18.940- 31:23.920* :  do you think the same resonance? Let's take his biggest hit, born in the USA.
*31:31.480- 31:38.660* :  Now, that appeals to flag waving mega cap wearing people who haven't really listened to the lyrics,
*31:38.660- 31:45.060* :  it's about how badly Vietnam vets were being treated, but then it also appealed to just anyone
*31:45.060- 31:51.600* :  who wants to punch the fist in the air in stadium, but it is in many ways quite anti-American dream.
*31:51.800- 31:59.340* :  Do you think the Ivers Academy is going to open its doors now to more non-British artists?
*31:59.340- 32:05.860* :  It's a nice thought, yes, it would be good if this wasn't a one off and it went a bit deeper into
*32:06.600- 32:12.080* :  what's been happening really over the last 30, 40 years with hip hop, for example, because
*32:12.500- 32:17.040* :  this isn't a new challenging new kid on the block genre, this has been around for a one,
*32:17.040- 32:22.560* :  had a massive impact, it's the music of the 21st century. Matt Charlton speaking to Julian Marshall.
*32:25.260- 32:30.720* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*32:31.220- 32:38.160* :  This edition was mixed by Jansis Heycox, and the producer was Emma Joseph, the editor is Karen
*32:38.200- 32:41.740* :  Martyr. I'm Alex Ritson, until next time, goodbye.
