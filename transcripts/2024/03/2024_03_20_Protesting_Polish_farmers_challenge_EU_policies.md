*01:47.680- 01:52.220* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday the 20th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:52.860- 01:58.560* :  The US Secretary of State heads to the Middle East for yet another round of Gaza cease-fire talks.
*01:58.560- 02:03.680* :  We get the latest. We'll also head to Poland for the latest round of European farmers' protests.
*02:04.100- 02:08.600* :  The changes to the Green Deal, the European Commission is proposing are purely cosmetic and will
*02:08.600- 02:11.920* :  leave everybody dissatisfied. We want more specific changes.
*02:14.660- 02:18.360* :  Also, in this podcast, Ireland's Prime Minister has announced his resignation.
*02:19.180- 02:23.420* :  When I came party leader, I knew that one part of leadership is knowing when the time has come
*02:23.420- 02:28.860* :  to pass on the baton to somebody else. That time is now. Meanwhile, in China.
*02:29.260- 02:36.080* :  It's really tough without a pension in rural areas. Now I have to pay my pension every month,
*02:36.080- 02:41.740* :  even if I don't eat or drink. We find out how the country is dealing with an aging
*02:41.740- 02:51.540* :  population. We begin in Poland, where thousands of farmers are holding a nationwide protest against
*02:51.540- 02:56.140* :  rising costs and competition from cheap agricultural produce from Ukraine.
*02:56.220- 03:01.220* :  Poland is just one European country where farmers say that the EU's decision to bring in
*03:01.220- 03:06.860* :  duty-free imports from Ukraine is one of several factors that's driving them towards bankruptcy.
*03:06.940- 03:13.680* :  The protesters are using tractors to block major roads in up to 600 locations across the country.
*03:14.180- 03:16.080* :  Tedros Kylater is one of the organizers.
*03:18.860- 03:23.380* :  The changes to the Green Deal, the European Commission is proposing are purely cosmetic
*03:23.380- 03:27.240* :  and will leave everybody dissatisfied. We want more specific changes.
*03:27.800- 03:31.760* :  And we feel anxious about the comments from the Prime Minister who suggested that our
*03:31.760- 03:36.180* :  protest might be controlled or inspired by someone else. This is simply untrue.
*03:36.760- 03:41.240* :  So what are the changes that the European Commission is proposing? Alice Adley is our
*03:41.240- 03:48.040* :  European editor. So European Parliament negotiators and representatives of the Belgian EU Presidency
*03:48.040- 03:54.240* :  have reached a provisional agreement to continue for a further year, a deal to grant Ukrainian
*03:54.240- 04:00.820* :  food producers tariff-free access to its markets. But they've capped imports of some grains,
*04:00.860- 04:07.460* :  including oats, maids and grotes, which are a type of coarse oat, also called buckwheat,
*04:07.460- 04:13.940* :  that only remain duty-free if quotas do not exceed average levels over the past two years.
*04:14.560- 04:19.940* :  Wheaton-Bali remained tariff-free for the next year, and they've also added an emergency break
*04:19.940- 04:27.680* :  for poultry, eggs and sugar, leading to tariffs if imports exceed the average levels of 22 and 2023.
*04:28.440- 04:35.540* :  Since June 2022, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the EU has suspended import
*04:35.540- 04:41.500* :  duties and quotas for imports from Ukraine to support its economy. However, cheap Ukrainian
*04:41.500- 04:47.480* :  grain exports have sparked protests by farmers in neighboring countries such as Poland and Hungary.
*04:48.180- 04:53.520* :  The Ukrainian Prime Minister today, Dennis Schmihal, has welcomed this deal, but France,
*04:53.520- 04:58.800* :  which is the EU's largest wheat producer, has called for more limits to be introduced and more
*04:58.800- 05:05.740* :  cereals to be included, including wheat. It takes place against the run-up to the European elections,
*05:05.740- 05:11.260* :  and many countries, including France, which, of course, has a strong farming lobby,
*05:11.760- 05:17.300* :  have to balance the concerns of their agricultural sector while maintaining their commitment to
*05:17.300- 05:22.540* :  supporting Ukraine. Adam Eastern is in the Polish capital war zone. He told me more about the
*05:22.540- 05:28.380* :  protest there. There's been protests right across Poland, the police in Poland estimate,
*05:28.380- 05:35.900* :  that as many as 70,000 Polish farmers are taking part in this protest, essentially mainly blocking
*05:35.900- 05:43.320* :  major roads and ring roads around cities with their tractors in almost 600 locations across
*05:43.320- 05:49.600* :  the country. It's the fourth time such a protest has happened so far this year. So causing considerable
*05:49.740- 05:56.960* :  traffic disruption throughout the country, but at the same time, the public here has considerable
*05:56.960- 06:01.560* :  sympathy for their demands. Indeed, I mean, Poland, like a lot of other nations in Europe,
*06:01.560- 06:07.220* :  have to tread a fine line, support Ukraine whilst not upsetting your own farmers back home.
*06:07.240- 06:12.580* :  To what extent will this move by the European Union have placated Polish farmers, do you think?
*06:13.040- 06:18.760* :  A bit, but not enough. The Polish government, which actually backs the farmers'
*06:18.760- 06:23.860* :  key demands, will be happy that more Ukrainian products can be restricted, but it wanted caps
*06:24.260- 06:30.620* :  to kick in once imports, which level seen in 2021, i.e. before Ukraine had tariff
*06:30.620- 06:36.140* :  re-access to the EU market when Ukrainian imports to Poland were much lower. Plus, the farmers themselves
*06:36.140- 06:42.780* :  want an immediate suspension of tariff re-access for all Ukrainian agricultural imports, because they
*06:42.940- 06:49.360* :  say family-run farms in Poland simply can't compete against big Ukrainian agriculture business.
*06:50.100- 06:54.440* :  And they have a second demand. They also want EU climate proposals that they say will raise
*06:54.440- 06:59.660* :  Polish farmers' costs thrown out. So, although the general direction is perhaps moving in the farmers,
*06:59.660- 07:05.820* :  favour a compromise has still not been reached. As for the government, it will continue to
*07:05.820- 07:11.200* :  call for increased military backing from Ukraine, from around the world, but it insists that that
*07:11.200- 07:18.260* :  support must not come at the expense of Polish farmers. Adam Eastern in water. A stifling climate
*07:18.260- 07:24.440* :  of fear, that says the UN, is the situation in many of the parts of Ukraine invaded by Moscow two
*07:24.440- 07:30.560* :  years ago. The report accuses Russia of the systematic suppression of Ukrainian language, culture,
*07:30.560- 07:36.740* :  and identity in Eastern Ukraine. Danielle Bell is the head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission
*07:36.740- 07:45.900* :  in Ukraine. We documented extraditional killings, torture, disappearances, widespread arbitrary
*07:45.900- 07:53.520* :  arrest and detention. Initially targeting those perceived to be affiliated with security forces,
*07:54.120- 08:00.640* :  and later on those expressing or believed to be supporting Ukraine were also targeted.
*08:01.500- 08:03.560* :  Are corresponded image and folks told me more?
*08:30.300- 08:37.880* :  pensions or other social benefits or health care, introduction of a Russian, a very pro-Russian
*08:37.880- 08:45.920* :  pro-invasion curriculum in the schools. So, we're really a kind of eradication of Ukrainian culture
*08:45.920- 08:53.000* :  and identity, which the report warns, we really have long, long consequences. Long after maybe
*08:53.000- 08:59.840* :  people stopped fighting in these areas, but the suppression and the loss of a history and a shared
*08:59.840- 09:05.180* :  culture, shared identity is a long-term thing. And imagine at the same time this report is also
*09:05.180- 09:11.500* :  critical of Ukraine in the areas it's retaken from Russia, isn't it? That's right. I mean, I think
*09:11.500- 09:18.220* :  here it's very difficult. Ukrainian forces had to deal with a loss of infrastructure, many, many,
*09:18.220- 09:25.380* :  many land mines that the Russians left, but also anger. And you know, people who were left in
*09:26.080- 09:31.500* :  occupied territories had to work under the Russians if they wanted to keep their jobs. Now,
*09:31.500- 09:39.700* :  some of those are being prosecuted for collaboration, and the UN says this is perhaps too broad
*09:39.700- 09:47.340* :  an interpretation of what the law on collaboration means. It's sowing further dissent in the community,
*09:47.340- 09:53.660* :  which could harm any, you know, regeneration of the community. And there again, one of the saddest
*09:53.660- 10:00.940* :  things about this report is the change in demographics that people who could fled, so the middle classes,
*10:01.520- 10:08.320* :  the young. And so these UN teams, in liberated territories, visited villages which once had several
*10:08.320- 10:14.640* :  hundred, even several thousand residents, now just a handful of less than a dozen in one, and all of
*10:14.640- 10:20.640* :  them very elderly people who didn't want to leave their land. Now they can't farm it because it's
*10:20.700- 10:29.080* :  full of mines. And this is a long, long, long, profound change for this part of Ukraine, which
*10:29.080- 10:34.100* :  will take years, probably decades, if we look at former Yugoslavia, to heal.
*10:34.940- 10:41.180* :  Imagine folks. The US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, is back in the Middle East for a
*10:41.180- 10:47.040* :  sixth time since the war in Gaza began. Mr. Blinken is visiting Saudi Arabia today before
*10:47.040- 10:53.000* :  moving on to Egypt. Hopes remain of putting a ceasefire plan together. In a moment, we'll hear from
*10:53.000- 10:57.760* :  our correspondent Anna Foster in Jerusalem. But first, let's go to the northern part of the Gaza
*10:57.760- 11:03.480* :  strip. The place where a ceasefire and an increase in aid, that would follow it, is most keenly
*11:03.480- 11:09.940* :  needed. Saib Alzad has been living there throughout the conflict. We live day by day. If we have the
*11:09.940- 11:15.960* :  food to this day, we are so thankful and we cannot think too much about, like, let's say, two days.
*11:16.000- 11:20.780* :  So we think day by day and we try to get our food day by day. Lately, they started to
*11:20.780- 11:26.460* :  protect the aid trucks that come in from south to the north. It's getting better, but it is not
*11:26.460- 11:34.380* :  enough at all. We lost many weight. Like, personally, each person of my family lost at least 20 kilos.
*11:35.000- 11:41.180* :  So this is a quite big problem for kids especially. Kids are always hungry and we cannot find
*11:41.180- 11:47.980* :  good things for them to eat. We cannot find anything for them like to let them stay still.
*11:47.980- 11:55.000* :  It is really hard. As Gaza residents, Saib Alzad, well, Anna Foster is our correspondent in Jerusalem.
*11:55.520- 11:59.840* :  I asked her more about what impact Mr Blinken's visit to the region might have this time.
*12:00.440- 12:04.960* :  The number of visits that he's made to the Middle East now is significant. And the countries he's
*12:04.960- 12:10.900* :  chosen this time, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Now Egypt, of course, are an important broker when it comes
*12:10.900- 12:16.540* :  to those ceasefire talks along with Qatar. I think the messages that Secretary Blinken is sending
*12:16.540- 12:21.240* :  are strong ones. You know, we heard him even on a visit to the Philippines yesterday talking about
*12:21.840- 12:27.280* :  the famine, which is approaching in Gaza, making that point that 100% of the population there are
*12:27.280- 12:32.880* :  facing severe acute food insecurity and just comparing that with other countries around the world.
*12:32.880- 12:38.740* :  So he's sending regular messages. We know that Joe Biden, the US President and the Israeli
*12:38.740- 12:43.620* :  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, had their first conversation in a month just a couple of days ago.
*12:44.360- 12:48.700* :  But a lot of this messaging is happening through the media, isn't it? We know that they have lines
*12:48.700- 12:53.180* :  of communication behind the scenes, but I think what is really interesting is that sort of tension
*12:53.180- 12:57.320* :  at the moment between the US and Israel where these messages have been very clearly sent
*12:57.660- 13:03.420* :  from the US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan just yesterday was calling Israel's argument
*13:03.420- 13:08.280* :  that it needed a ground offensive in Raffa nonsense. So it feels like the language is getting
*13:08.280- 13:13.600* :  stronger, but it feels like Israel's defiance of some of those messages continues as well. So it
*13:13.600- 13:18.380* :  will be interesting to see how they manage to resolve that. What leverage do the Arab leaders have
*13:18.380- 13:24.740* :  over these talks at the moment, do you think? That's an interesting question. I mean, Qatar have a
*13:24.740- 13:31.400* :  particular degree of leverage. The most senior Hamas leaders live in Qatar. We heard actually when
*13:31.400- 13:35.860* :  Hamas put forward their most recent proposal for a ceasefire at the back end of last week.
*13:35.860- 13:42.380* :  The Israeli response said that Qatar had been in their words putting pressure on Hamas for the
*13:42.380- 13:48.060* :  first time, similarly before when things have been particularly tense, when wars have broken out
*13:48.060- 13:52.980* :  previously, Egypt have always been very heavily involved in trying to negotiate these things.
*13:53.500- 13:58.260* :  Arab leaders elsewhere, they're a strong grouping, but less of an impact. They don't really have
*13:58.260- 14:02.800* :  the same amount of leverage as Qatar and Egypt have. Of course, Qatar and Egypt would like to see a
*14:02.800- 14:07.620* :  ceasefire because it reflects well on them. If they can broker it, if they can steer through these
*14:07.620- 14:11.840* :  choppy waters and manage to get the two sides to agree. But I think the fact that we haven't had
*14:11.840- 14:18.420* :  any kind of meaningful ceasefire deal since November of last year just shows how difficult those
*14:18.420- 14:25.900* :  talks continue to be. Anna Foster. Now to an extraordinary London nurse who 50 years ago was dubbed
*14:25.900- 14:31.940* :  one of the fastest women in Africa. 72-year-old Rose Amanquah is the longest-serving nurse
*14:31.940- 14:37.740* :  at West London's Central Middlesex Hospital. Next week, she'll be hanging up her nursing gown after
*14:37.740- 14:44.200* :  a stellar 49 years of duty. But Rose was breaking records long before her hospital career began,
*14:44.720- 14:49.760* :  as an international athlete for Ghana. BBC Sport Africa's Nishat Ladder takes up the story.
*14:56.620- 15:02.220* :  Meet Matron Rose Amanquah, an award-winning nurse serving her patients for almost half a
*15:02.220- 15:09.000* :  century. A mother of four, a grandmother to ten, and a former medal-winning sprinter for Ghana.
*15:13.320- 15:20.740* :  If I was young now, I would love to go back to Iran because I watch athletes by the
*15:20.740- 15:27.600* :  damn only, the world champion, the Olympic Games. I even record it so that I can learn from it
*15:27.600- 15:33.200* :  to say, oh, I wish I was young to run. She discovered her talent through the inter-school system
*15:33.200- 15:38.400* :  in the Ghanaian city of Gomesi, first in Long Jump and High Jump and then in the sprints
*15:38.880- 15:43.700* :  until Ghana athletics came calling and the medal rush started in 1973.
*15:44.080- 15:51.000* :  I was the second fastest in all second African games in Nigeria and I also got a medal
*15:51.100- 15:57.340* :  for all Africa and America in Mexico, which I won the 100 metres.
*15:57.900- 16:02.400* :  One of Rose's greatest achievements was winning a Sprint Relay bronze with Ghana at the
*16:02.400- 16:08.860* :  Christ Church Commonwealth Games in 1974. It's very, very special to win that medal and that
*16:08.860- 16:14.060* :  will be forever in anywhere you go, Google, wherever you go. My name will be, say,
*16:14.060- 16:21.220* :  Rose is Sidwa and my other three friends that we won a bronze medal. I so dream about it.
*16:21.400- 16:26.620* :  Rose followed one of her brothers to London and she was inspired to go into nursing by a neighbour.
*16:27.100- 16:31.560* :  Her hospital would wrote to her sympathetically so that she could carry on her training
*16:31.560- 16:35.920* :  where she even crossed paths with former Olympic champion Linford Christie.
*16:36.560- 16:40.800* :  She was all set to represent Ghana at the 1976 Montreal Olympics,
*16:40.860- 16:46.640* :  but that dream was shattered after Africa boycotted the games, leaving her to focus on her
*16:46.640- 16:52.520* :  family and her nursing career. Retirement will give Rose plenty of time to spend with her
*16:52.520- 17:01.200* :  sporting family. Her son Kevin was a former professional footballer in England's lower leagues.
*17:01.760- 17:04.840* :  One of her granddaughters is with the Great British Gymnastics team.
*17:05.300- 17:10.120* :  Another is with the British Dancing team and her grandson is on the books of Tottenham's Academy.
*17:10.560- 17:16.380* :  And this was made, look, that's made it. So, you know, Africa needs to become made.
*17:17.140- 17:20.200* :  As Rose opens up her treasure trove of pictures and medals,
*17:20.200- 17:25.460* :  she's still hoping that one member of her family, perhaps Lorraine's young daughter Kiana,
*17:25.460- 17:28.560* :  will follow in her footsteps and become an athlete.
*17:28.880- 17:31.460* :  What do you love doing with your Nana when you're together?
*17:32.320- 17:33.060* :  I love sports.
*17:33.760- 17:35.440* :  Can you run fast like your Nana?
*17:35.960- 17:37.540* :  I can run really fast.
*17:38.020- 17:41.140* :  So, I'm looking forward for the Olympic Games in France.
*17:41.240- 17:46.140* :  I'm going to relax in my chair, not recording it, but watch it live.
*17:47.180- 17:48.860* :  I will really, really miss my job.
*17:53.340- 17:53.900* :  Still to come.
*17:54.220- 17:58.880* :  You'll find that wealth is way more evenly distributed and also each one supports a
*17:58.880- 18:01.560* :  wealth or state that provides psychological stability.
*18:02.160- 18:05.660* :  We found out what life is like in the world's happiest country.
*18:09.460- 18:12.640* :  Hi, Namalanta combo here with some very exciting news.
*18:13.220- 18:17.120* :  My award-winning podcast, Dear Daughter, is back for a new series.
*18:17.720- 18:20.680* :  I'm putting together a handbook to life for daughters everywhere,
*18:21.160- 18:23.700* :  collecting letters from listeners from all over the world,

*19:51.200- 19:53.100* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*19:53.100- 19:58.840* :  Now, perhaps the worst humanitarian crisis Sudan has ever known is looming.
*19:59.440- 20:02.320* :  For well over a year, there has been a vicious power struggle
*20:02.540- 20:04.960* :  between the country's military and its former ally,
*20:04.960- 20:07.860* :  the rapid support forces paramilitary group.
*20:08.500- 20:11.900* :  Millions of people are going hungry and have been displaced by the fighting.
*20:12.420- 20:16.920* :  BBC Arabic's Ferris Kalani has managed to travel with the Sudanese army
*20:16.920- 20:20.680* :  to the front line city of Omdurman and sent this report.
*20:23.320- 20:27.340* :  Moments of celebration for a rare success in a forgotten war.
*20:28.580- 20:34.500* :  Affegile victory for Sudanese army troops against fighters of the rapid support forces.
*20:38.400- 20:40.400* :  The army is pushing towards the capital.
*20:41.380- 20:44.620* :  With the RSF still controlling areas nearby.
*20:52.120- 20:55.280* :  We went to Sudan's second largest city, Omdurman,
*20:55.900- 20:57.180* :  on the west of the River Nile.
*20:58.140- 21:01.100* :  The main market was once crowded and full of life.
*21:01.960- 21:03.820* :  But what we saw was destroying.
*21:04.540- 21:07.680* :  Bullet holes, twisted metal, rubble everywhere.
*21:10.260- 21:16.380* :  The army brought us here, keen to show us the damage they say the RSF inflected to this city.
*21:16.980- 21:19.780* :  They tightly controlled what we saw and where we went.
*21:21.500- 21:24.460* :  We heard stories of rape, looting, and violence.
*21:25.400- 21:33.220* :  The UN says both sides face accusations of horrific abuses and war crimes claims they both deny.
*21:36.240- 21:40.780* :  Thousands of people have been killed since this war erupted last April.
*21:41.720- 21:47.360* :  Millions have had to leave their lives behind, but some couldn't, and they paid the pass.
*21:51.760- 21:58.300* :  64-year-old Buftar shows me how the war turned his town square into a makeshift graveyard.
*22:03.020- 22:05.180* :  There are 150 people here.
*22:06.460- 22:13.560* :  I knew many of them, Muhammad, Abdullah, Jalal is just me left.
*22:14.100- 22:15.680* :  A moment to remember their names.
*22:16.460- 22:18.980* :  These graves are now just marked with numbers.
*22:21.960- 22:25.420* :  Children are facing a living nightmare here according to the UN.
*22:26.220- 22:29.380* :  They say a whole generation's future is at risk.
*22:31.120- 22:36.280* :  We are at a school that's now a shelter in Port Sudan for families fleeing the violence.
*22:37.120- 22:40.420* :  300 of them crammed into the classrooms and corridors.
*22:41.120- 22:44.420* :  These classrooms should be full of children learning.
*22:44.420- 22:49.800* :  Instead, desperate people from across Sudan are sheltering here for safety,
*22:50.140- 22:52.720* :  but there are horrible stories hidden here.
*22:53.500- 22:58.420* :  Five people have died of cholera and others are suffering from severe diseases.
*22:58.940- 23:05.060* :  In a small room with 20 people sharing eight beds, Zubayda, a mother of eight, has leukemia.
*23:05.360- 23:10.240* :  She hasn't had any medication for her illness since the war started nearly a year ago.
*23:11.820- 23:14.740* :  My last pills finished three days before the war.
*23:15.340- 23:17.360* :  From that moment on, I'm suffering.
*23:18.140- 23:21.040* :  I'm in constant pain. I'm so tired.
*23:25.500- 23:28.580* :  The cries of starving children being treated in a clinic.
*23:28.620- 23:32.000* :  It feels like a frontline of a humanitarian disaster.
*23:32.520- 23:34.400* :  The word doesn't know is happening.
*23:35.500- 23:38.880* :  Mary Louise, the UNICEF debut year representative for Sudan,
*23:39.460- 23:46.100* :  told us hundreds of thousands of children are at emergency levels of hunger and it could get worse.
*23:46.780- 23:53.580* :  We're facing right now a lethal combination of mass displacement, hunger and disease outbreaks
*23:53.980- 23:56.620* :  and that's putting Sudan on the brink of famine.
*23:57.920- 23:59.500* :  That pill from here is clear.
*23:59.900- 24:02.960* :  The world is being urged not to forget this war,
*24:03.400- 24:04.440* :  all the people of Sudan.
*24:05.320- 24:06.580* :  Ferras Kilani reporting.
*24:07.720- 24:12.500* :  Now to Ireland, where people are stunned by the surprise announcement that it's coalition
*24:12.500- 24:17.380* :  government leader Leo Voradka is stepping down as head of his party.
*24:17.800- 24:21.620* :  And he's going to resign as T-shirt as soon as his successor is selected.
*24:22.140- 24:24.420* :  He said his reasons were both personal and political.
*24:25.300- 24:29.240* :  When I came party leader and T-shirt back in June 2017,
*24:30.380- 24:34.720* :  I knew that one part of leadership is knowing when the time has come to pass on the battle
*24:34.720- 24:38.100* :  onto somebody else and then having the courage to do it.
*24:38.640- 24:39.420* :  That time is now.
*24:40.340- 24:42.960* :  So I am resigning as president and leader of Finne Gayle Effective today.
*24:43.740- 24:47.520* :  And we'll resign as T-shirt as soon as my successor is able to take up that office.
*24:48.180- 24:51.000* :  So how are people reacting to the unexpected announcement?
*24:51.520- 24:52.300* :  And what's behind it?
*24:52.500- 24:56.500* :  Pat Leahy, the political editor of the Irish Times, gave us his thoughts.
*24:57.220- 24:58.720* :  Well, it's a bit of a shock obviously.
*24:58.880- 25:01.120* :  Nobody had seen this coming.
*25:01.180- 25:05.780* :  You know, I think that when the dust settles, people will see it as both.
*25:05.780- 25:11.140* :  And the T-shirt mentioned this in his announcement that has just concluded at government buildings
*25:11.140- 25:13.840* :  that he's doing it for both personal and political reasons.
*25:13.980- 25:17.800* :  He's been full-time politician almost all his adult life.
*25:17.800- 25:21.140* :  He's been T-shirt since 2017.
*25:22.240- 25:24.420* :  And I suppose he's at a stage in his life.
*25:24.420- 25:25.620* :  He's in his mid 40s.
*25:25.620- 25:28.600* :  He's at a stage in his life where he's looking at his options.
*25:28.600- 25:34.080* :  And I think his conclusion was clearly that not alone did he really not want to spend
*25:34.240- 25:36.800* :  the next five or 10 years in politics.
*25:36.800- 25:42.920* :  But the political currents were such that he could see an advantage for his party if he departed now.
*25:42.920- 25:46.620* :  And that's very much the framing that he was giving this decision.
*25:47.140- 25:49.000* :  His party isn't doing well in the polls.
*25:49.040- 25:52.540* :  There are about 20% a little bit below 20% in the polls.
*25:52.540- 25:55.700* :  And his own personal ratings have suffered as well.
*25:55.720- 26:01.780* :  And there was a sense in his party, Finne Gayle, that the party was just really drifting.
*26:01.780- 26:08.300* :  And I think that that sort of a sense of aimlessness and drift might be one of the reasons
*26:08.300- 26:10.300* :  why we're seeing this move from Mr. Friday now.
*26:11.060- 26:11.940* :  Pat Lee, he there.
*26:12.900- 26:17.800* :  Next to China where the country's leaders are trying to find ways to battle what many
*26:17.800- 26:21.340* :  economists have described as a demographic ticking time bomb.
*26:21.340- 26:24.120* :  The country is aging and shrinking.
*26:24.120- 26:29.440* :  One in five people are over the age of 60, which is the largest elderly population in the world.
*26:30.140- 26:34.960* :  Pension and health care systems are struggling to cope at a time when women are having fewer
*26:34.960- 26:38.280* :  babies. So can China afford to grow old?
*26:38.620- 26:41.080* :  Our China correspondent Laura Bicker has been finding out.
*26:42.440- 26:48.400* :  At the back of morning exercise class, grandma Fenn and her friends are giggling and gossiping
*26:48.400- 26:53.920* :  like schoolgirls. They live together in one of China's flagship elderly care homes in the south
*26:53.920- 26:54.600* :  of the country.
*26:59.020- 27:03.300* :  She's decided to pay for long-term care, rather than rely on her son.
*27:05.380- 27:10.860* :  I'm more open-minded, but I thought it true. I gave my house to my son.
*27:11.600- 27:13.960* :  All we need is our two pension cars.
*27:17.740- 27:22.440* :  The home is partly funded by private companies, so that could help out local governments
*27:22.440- 27:28.200* :  who are deep in debt. But after the pandemic, the home is currently running at a loss,
*27:28.800- 27:30.880* :  so Beijing does need other ideas.
*27:34.540- 27:38.340* :  On the sunny banks of the Grand Canal in Hangzhou, we meet four women,
*27:38.760- 27:41.620* :  all over 55, touching up their makeup.
*27:42.740- 27:47.720* :  They're a new kind of social media star, promoting graying gracefully.
*27:48.440- 27:52.440* :  Shui Shui was once the former finance director of a major Chinese company.
*27:53.100- 28:00.860* :  I am one of the generation that really benefit from the country's reform and open-to-world
*28:00.860- 28:07.620* :  policy. Then maybe it is our obligation also to promote our image to the world.
*28:08.120- 28:12.900* :  China hopes more over 60s will continue working as the economy slows.
*28:15.080- 28:18.320* :  So we've come to the north of China to lounging province.
*28:18.380- 28:25.100* :  The reason we've come here is because it has the highest percentage of elderly in the whole of China.
*28:26.200- 28:29.700* :  Former digger operator Tang Guo looks after six residents.
*28:30.320- 28:34.120* :  She grows all her own crops. The animals too are dinner.
*28:35.640- 28:40.560* :  She's tapping into the need to find solutions for the large elderly population in this province.
*28:43.020- 28:45.920* :  It's really tough without a pension in rural areas.
*28:46.500- 28:50.520* :  Just see that's 85-year-old man. He doesn't have a pension,
*28:50.520- 28:53.740* :  relying entirely on his son and daughter.
*28:54.380- 28:58.840* :  Now I have to pay my pension every month, even if I don't eat or drink.
*29:00.200- 29:02.500* :  But for some retirement, we'll never be an option.
*29:03.380- 29:07.200* :  In a village nearby, we find farmer Han Xiaosao and his wife,
*29:07.420- 29:09.400* :  collecting firewood to heat their home.
*29:09.600- 29:10.820* :  Do you have a pension?
*29:11.800- 29:13.540* :  No, I don't have a pension.
*29:14.500- 29:15.180* :  What can I do?
*29:15.660- 29:18.400* :  I guess I will become a burden for my children.
*29:19.280- 29:24.380* :  Like much of rural China, there are very few young people left here to look after the old,
*29:25.420- 29:30.220* :  especially after decades of a policy allowing couples to only have one child.
*29:31.140- 29:35.500* :  The rising ranks of the elderly are causing a dramatic imbalance,
*29:35.500- 29:39.460* :  which threatens the future of the world's second largest economy,
*29:40.160- 29:44.520* :  which means China may grow old, before it gets rich.
*29:44.980- 29:45.480* :  Laura Bicker.
*29:46.380- 29:50.560* :  And now, as a bit of an antidote to some of the more downbeat events happening,
*29:50.560- 29:51.900* :  let's talk about happiness.
*29:52.700- 29:57.180* :  Today, the UN's official report is out on the world's happiest countries,
*29:57.620- 29:59.820* :  with Finland, once again topping the list,
*30:00.360- 30:04.940* :  that looks at things like social support, income, freedom and lack of corruption.
*30:05.320- 30:07.920* :  Last year, Stephanie Prentice went to Finland,
*30:07.920- 30:11.100* :  when it won for the sixth time, and she told me more.
*30:11.860- 30:14.920* :  These scandy countries just really seem to know what they're doing, don't they?
*30:14.920- 30:19.600* :  So yeah, Finland, once again, at the top, seventh time, people there reporting around an eight
*30:19.600- 30:22.840* :  out of ten score on the index. That's pretty high for this.
*30:23.240- 30:25.420* :  Denmark not far off, as well as Sweden.
*30:25.960- 30:29.940* :  So as you mentioned, I went to this masterclass, it was called Find Your Inner Fin,
*30:30.380- 30:32.200* :  last summer, to find out why.
*30:32.820- 30:37.100* :  And I learned about their mix of outdoorsy lifestyles, so imagine jumping in lakes,
*30:37.100- 30:41.140* :  hiking in the forests, focus on self-care and connection.
*30:41.140- 30:44.940* :  So think daily saunas with your friends, that's very normal there,
*30:45.540- 30:46.640* :  and a sense of presence.
*30:46.640- 30:51.000* :  So things like slowing down, taking time to prepare your food and to enjoy it.
*30:51.500- 30:56.160* :  And something the speaker described to me was a sense of being content with your lot in life,
*30:56.160- 30:58.720* :  not every being others, not looking at your neighbours,
*30:59.300- 31:03.100* :  generally less of a showing off culture in terms of wealth and status.
*31:03.820- 31:09.120* :  And now wealth, and how wealth is distributed, that's very important in terms of this report.
*31:09.120- 31:13.240* :  So this is probably a good time to listen to the editor of the World Happiness Report.
*31:13.240- 31:15.200* :  This is Jean Emanuel Denev.
*31:15.520- 31:18.020* :  So in Finland, Denmark, and the other Scandinavian countries,
*31:18.020- 31:21.080* :  you'll find that wealth is way more evenly distributed,
*31:21.360- 31:25.580* :  and then also each one supports a wealth or a state that provides psychological stability.
*31:25.580- 31:29.700* :  But there's also a healthy life expectancy, which is also very high in Scandinavian countries,
*31:29.700- 31:31.800* :  whereas in other wealthy countries like the United States,
*31:32.320- 31:34.760* :  life expectancy is actually going down for certain segments.
*31:34.780- 31:37.380* :  And Steph, what else do we learn from this year's report?
*31:37.960- 31:41.480* :  We learned the unhappiest places, so Afghanistan and Lebanon,
*31:41.480- 31:44.480* :  they held the bottom spots for the second year in a row.
*31:44.960- 31:49.940* :  The US, now this is interesting, dropped out of the top 20 for the first time.
*31:49.940- 31:55.300* :  So it was 15th last year, and younger people there in particular reported lower rates of
*31:55.300- 31:59.340* :  happiness. In fact, actually, if they only used the data from the over 60s,
*31:59.540- 32:01.900* :  the US would be at 10th on the list.
*32:02.520- 32:06.520* :  And that's important because aged disparity, that's really something the report highlighted
*32:06.520- 32:10.860* :  this year in particular, even calling for policy action around youth wellbeing.
*32:10.860- 32:15.040* :  That was particularly in North America, as well as Western Europe and the UK.
*32:15.040- 32:18.940* :  And the data also showed that even in those happy countries, quote-unquote,
*32:19.440- 32:22.780* :  older people are now significantly happier than younger people.
*32:23.040- 32:25.500* :  Steph, we heard earlier that Finland has got a lot of advantages.
*32:25.500- 32:27.480* :  This is a very wealthy, very stable place.
*32:27.880- 32:32.840* :  But I hear you've been hearing tips, more general tips from the things about how to be happy.
*32:33.280- 32:36.040* :  Well, I quickly spoke to the Finnish tourism board this morning.
*32:36.040- 32:37.960* :  They're thrilled with the news over there.
*32:38.360- 32:42.720* :  And they told me, for 2024, they're going to adapt an old Finnish proverb
*32:42.860- 32:44.360* :  that's about being modest.
*32:44.360- 32:48.240* :  So the old one was, the one who has happiness should hide it.
*32:48.620- 32:50.300* :  I was quite confused when I first heard that.
