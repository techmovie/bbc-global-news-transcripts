*00:53.220- 00:56.760* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:59.260- 01:06.180* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 11th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:06.740- 01:12.140* :  The movie Oppenheimer has swept the board at the Oscars with seven awards including best picture
*01:12.480- 01:18.300* :  and best director. We have the latest on the winners and losers from the Academy Awards in Los Angeles.
*01:19.020- 01:23.580* :  The start of Ramadan brings no relief for the people of Gaza, what are described as
*01:23.580- 01:28.800* :  technical difficulties, mean an age-ship bound for Gaza is still stuck in Cyprus.
*01:29.360- 01:35.060* :  Caribbean leaders are meeting in Jamaica to discuss fears of famine and growing anarchy in Haiti.
*01:37.900- 01:43.520* :  Also in this podcast, Princess Kate says sorry over the international confusion caused by her
*01:43.520- 01:50.120* :  editing of a family photograph and actor Idris Elba dreams big for his mum and Sierra Leone
*01:50.120- 01:55.140* :  with a smart city. The start of me wants to build that beautiful retirement home for my mum.
*01:55.320- 02:00.200* :  It's a dream but I work in the make-believe business and it's exactly that.
*02:04.840- 02:11.140* :  We start with the 96th Oscars, the Academy Awards ceremony where the blockbuster biopic
*02:11.140- 02:15.740* :  Oppenheimer was crowned best picture winning seven Oscars in total.
*02:16.160- 02:21.140* :  Unlike past years where films few had seen sometimes won honors, Oppenheimer was a crowd
*02:21.140- 02:27.160* :  pleaser with nearly a billion dollars in ticket sales. So for more on the winners and losers at all
*02:27.160- 02:32.900* :  you need to know from the glitz and glamour of the red carpet, the BBC's culture editor Katie
*02:32.900- 02:39.360* :  Razzle sent this report from Los Angeles. And welcome to the 96th Oscars everybody, look at these.
*02:39.860- 02:44.240* :  It started as we knew it was going to go on and Oscars with a few major surprises.
*02:44.800- 02:49.540* :  The first award, best supporting actress Daveine Joy Randolph, the favourite for months
*02:49.540- 02:56.400* :  for her stunning performance in the holdovers. For so long I've always wanted to be different
*02:57.300- 03:04.560* :  and now I realize I just need to be myself. And the Oscar goes to Robert Downey Jr.
*03:05.280- 03:10.100* :  Robert Downey Jr. has been himself through the Oscars race and was a dead cert for best
*03:10.100- 03:14.560* :  supporting actor for Oppenheimer. I'd like to thank my terrible childhood.
*03:15.680- 03:20.480* :  Oppenheimer has been the front runner in so many categories and the big awards went as
*03:23.780- 03:28.320* :  predicted. Best actor for Killian Murphy as the theoretical physicist often dubbed the father
*03:28.320- 03:32.460* :  of the atomic bomb. For better or for worse we're all living in Oppenheimer's world so I would
*03:32.460- 03:37.700* :  really like to dedicate this to the peacemakers everywhere. Seven awards for Christopher Nolan's
*03:37.700- 03:43.000* :  film in all including Best Director and Best Picture. The first time in years that a big budget
*03:43.000- 03:48.340* :  widely watched movie has won that top award but then Nolan makes Art House blockbusters.
*03:48.560- 03:52.320* :  Movies are just a little bit over a hundred years old. We don't know where this incredible
*03:52.320- 03:58.020* :  journey is going from here but to know that you think that I'm a meaningful part of it means
*03:58.020- 04:06.760* :  the world to me thank you very much. Oppenheimer was blocked from a truly record-breaking night
*04:06.760- 04:12.440* :  by poor things. A host of predominantly British talent in costume makeup and production design
*04:12.440- 04:17.500* :  were awarded for the hugely original world they created. And the Oscar goes to
*04:18.960- 04:22.940* :  Emma Stone. And Emma Stone, the star, walking away with best actress.
*04:23.560- 04:29.600* :  It's not about me. It's about a team that came together to make something greater than the
*04:29.600- 04:36.700* :  some of its parts. Have you told all the truth? Stone's win meant history wasn't made by Lily
*04:36.700- 04:42.080* :  Gladstone who could have become the first Native American to win an acting Oscar. But there were
*04:42.080- 04:47.260* :  other records made. The Holocaust film The Zone of Interest is the first British movie to win
*04:47.260- 04:52.540* :  Best International feature. His director is Jonathan Glazer. Whether the victims of October
*04:52.540- 04:58.120* :  the 7th in Israel or the ongoing attack on Gaza all the victims of this two humanisation.
*04:59.200- 05:06.060* :  How do we resist? Ukraine won its first Oscar for the documentary 20 days in Marriapol.
*05:06.580- 05:11.420* :  The Academy's more international makeup was also reflected in the original screenplay Oscar
*05:11.760- 05:16.880* :  for the French legal drama Anatomy of a Fall. Just in Trier is co-writer and director.
*05:17.700- 05:22.560* :  Thank you so much. It will help me through my midlife crisis, I think.
*05:23.040- 05:28.840* :  And while Barbie may have only won one Oscar and for a different song, Ryan Gosling's rendition
*05:28.840- 05:34.520* :  of I'm Just Ken in a hot pink suit with the legendary guitarist Slash Stolarsche.
*05:43.400- 05:49.980* :  That report by Katie Razzle. The screenwriter Nazin Chaudry is a Londoner now living in L.A.
*05:49.980- 05:55.060* :  who was nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Film for her directorial debut called Red, White,
*05:55.060- 06:01.100* :  and Blue. It chronicles the immensely painful reality of America's politics of abortion. She
*06:01.100- 06:06.700* :  didn't win, but just before heading to Elton Johns after party, she did take a call from us.
*06:06.760- 06:10.140* :  Amel Rajan asked her about what must be mixed emotions.
*06:10.800- 06:16.500* :  You know, we were so happy to have been nominated. It was beyond our expectations even to reach
*06:16.500- 06:22.760* :  the nomination stage just because we're so independent. We just put this film together through
*06:23.380- 06:28.900* :  a lot of hard labour and love. Although we didn't win in the end, we hope we still told a story
*06:28.900- 06:33.360* :  that was worth telling. Tell us about that story because for those who haven't seen it, Red,
*06:33.360- 06:39.020* :  White, and Blue really kind of ruminates to put it mildly on the very, very divisive and painful
*06:39.020- 06:45.140* :  abortion politics of America. Those politics have gone through massive rations in recent years,
*06:45.140- 06:50.200* :  including a June 2022 decision in what became known as Dobbs versus Jackson Women's Health
*06:50.200- 06:55.700* :  Organisation. Just tell us what the motivation for the film was. What it was exactly, what you say in
*06:55.700- 07:02.640* :  June 2022, that decision, which then also had the knock on effect of Roe v Wade being overturned
*07:02.640- 07:08.500* :  and legislation almost immediately been enacted in certain states that really set up obstacles
*07:08.500- 07:14.480* :  for people getting that healthcare. And so I wrote this in July 2022 and we filmed it last March.
*07:14.480- 07:20.060* :  Just decided that we need to tell a very characterful and human story that transcended politics.
*07:20.060- 07:26.180* :  You know, this is not something that should be divisive. It's healthcare. And so even though
*07:26.180- 07:30.880* :  it's become very contentious, we set up out trying to tell a story that showed all the reasons why
*07:30.880- 07:36.000* :  it shouldn't be that way and why we should just really look at another person who needs
*07:36.000- 07:42.220* :  discompassion in terms of the predicaments that they might find themselves in that requires this
*07:42.220- 07:49.420* :  kind of procedure. Screenwriter Nazrin Chowdry and after the success of Oppenheimer at the Oscars,
*07:49.420- 07:54.660* :  you can find out more about the race to make the atomic bomb with a podcast from the BBC World
*07:54.660- 08:00.500* :  Service to hear about the scientists and the spies who changed history. Search for the bomb wherever
*08:00.500- 08:06.520* :  you get your BBC podcasts. For many Muslims in the Middle East, the start of the holy month of
*08:06.520- 08:12.940* :  Ramadan is overshadowed by the Gaza conflict. One man whose wife died in Gaza told the BBC that
*08:12.940- 08:19.520* :  people there are not fasting, they're starving. Juliet Tumor is from the UN Agency for Palestinian
*08:19.520- 08:26.640* :  refugees. This Ramadan is going to be a very sad one. People in Gaza were very much looking forward
*08:26.640- 08:33.700* :  to a ceasefire or as I was sort of a pause. They're absolutely exhausted, understandably, after
*08:33.700- 08:41.740* :  five months of a very brutal war. And it's going to be very difficult to have, you know, that one
*08:41.740- 08:48.420* :  meal a day where people break the fast. It's now five months since the Hamas attacks that killed
*08:48.420- 08:54.060* :  more than a thousand people. A truce between Israel and Hamas, which is regarded as a terrorist
*08:54.060- 08:59.600* :  group by many Western governments, remains elusive. And there are renewed fears of the violent spreading.
*08:59.600- 09:05.160* :  Just before we recorded this podcast, our Middle East correspondent, Yoland Nell, in Jerusalem,
*09:05.160- 09:10.300* :  gave us the latest on the fighting in Gaza. Well, it's really media actually saying that
*09:10.300- 09:16.200* :  Israel's checking at the moment if Hamas's second highest military leader has been killed in an
*09:16.200- 09:22.840* :  Israeli air strike. This, after, of course, talks stumbled to secure new truce in the war to
*09:22.840- 09:27.820* :  coincide with Ramadan. I mean, if that death is confirmed, he would be the highest ranking official
*09:27.820- 09:33.780* :  from Hamas to be killed in this war that's gone on now for more than five months. Israeli army
*09:33.780- 09:38.640* :  radio saying that Israel's been bombing the Anusodat camp in the center of Gaza on Saturday night.
*09:38.640- 09:45.660* :  It had intelligence. It says about the location of this senior figure there. And we understand from
*09:45.840- 09:50.460* :  one of the newspapers, harrets that Israel's checking if these fatalities reported that might include
*09:50.460- 09:57.360* :  this man. Now, otherwise, you can see that the fighting still goes on in Gaza. We had pictures
*09:57.360- 10:04.220* :  early this morning showing smoke rising up from Raffa shortly after dawn as local people would have
*10:04.220- 10:09.760* :  begun their day of fasting on local journalists, told us a car was targeted, also an agricultural
*10:09.760- 10:14.460* :  area on the Egyptian border. And that three people were killed due to shelling of a family house in
*10:14.460- 10:19.280* :  the east of Raffa in Hanyunis, which is, of course, been the main focus of Israel's southern offensive.
*10:19.720- 10:24.720* :  There have been residential blocks demolished by Israel and the Hamad city complex, still heavy
*10:24.720- 10:30.840* :  gunfire and shelling in Hanyunis. And violence in Jerusalem? Well, it remains extremely tense in
*10:30.840- 10:37.020* :  Jerusalem today, relatively quiet, as most people begin their day of fasting. We've still got
*10:37.020- 10:42.920* :  thousands of Israeli police deployed, particularly around the old city in the narrow streets of Jerusalem.
*10:43.740- 10:48.100* :  Reports last night that when the customary prayers were taking place after Ramadan was announced
*10:48.100- 10:51.780* :  that several hundred people were denied access. There are some social media videos you can see
*10:51.780- 10:54.140* :  the police using their batons there.
*10:54.400- 11:00.740* :  Yehland now in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, a ship carrying aid for Gaza has been delayed leaving Cyprus.
*11:01.220- 11:06.840* :  Here's Quentin Somerville. The aid ship, the open arms and its barge of 200 tons of food supplies
*11:06.840- 11:12.280* :  were expected to leave Cyprus at the weekend, but both remained docked in Larnica port. The charity
*11:12.280- 11:16.840* :  behind the plan world central kitchen blamed technical difficulties for the delay, but said
*11:16.840- 11:21.540* :  hope to leave as soon as possible. It would be the first time that aid had been delivered by
*11:21.540- 11:26.820* :  Ceta Gaza, which has no functioning port. The charity is building a jetty to receive the supplies.
*11:28.060- 11:33.300* :  If the ship successfully delivers its cargo, then more ships will follow as part of a new maritime
*11:33.300- 11:38.920* :  relief corridor. The situation inside Gaza is desperate. Children are dying of malnutrition,
*11:39.440- 11:42.180* :  and the UN warns that famine is almost inevitable.
*11:42.180- 11:48.840* :  Quentin Somerville. The Princess of Wales has apologised for any confusion surrounding a photo
*11:48.840- 11:54.520* :  of herself and her children released to celebrate Mothering Sunday. Big news agencies had withdrawn
*11:54.520- 11:59.820* :  it, saying it had been digitally manipulated. We heard more from our correspondent Sophie Long.
*12:00.220- 12:05.240* :  The Princess of Wales has actually posted on social media on X-formally Twitter,
*12:05.720- 12:10.800* :  and she said that, like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.
*12:10.800- 12:15.460* :  I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photographed we shared yesterday
*12:15.460- 12:21.100* :  caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother's Day, and that's just signed off
*12:21.100- 12:27.500* :  C. So that opposed from the Princess of Wales explaining why it had been digitally manipulated.
*12:27.520- 12:32.080* :  Now of course this was a lovely photo that was released yesterday for Mothering Sunday,
*12:32.580- 12:37.200* :  and it shows the Princess of Wales with her three children hugging them and they appear to be
*12:37.200- 12:41.420* :  roaring with laughter. And that's what it was supposed to do, celebrate Mother's Day. But of course
*12:41.420- 12:47.200* :  there has been an intense level of interest in the Princess of Wales health since she had surgery
*12:47.200- 12:52.800* :  and spent 13 days in hospital in London, and of course this was the first time we've seen her
*12:52.800- 12:56.820* :  since Christmas Day. That was the last public duty she carried out. So there was a huge amount
*12:56.820- 13:01.260* :  of speculation that they were hoping the palace this would put an end to, but of course it appeared
*13:01.260- 13:06.820* :  to create more questions than answers. In terms of Kensington Palace, they have said that
*13:06.820- 13:11.740* :  this was an amateur family photograph taken by the Prince of Wales. The Royal Highness is
*13:11.740- 13:15.640* :  wanted to offer an informal picture of the family together for Mother's Day, and the Princess
*13:15.640- 13:20.040* :  made minor adjustments as she shared in her statement on social media. Now we'll see how
*13:20.340- 13:24.600* :  the rest of social media reacts to that, but you know many people take pictures with their
*13:24.600- 13:29.280* :  mobile phones these days and a huge number of people of course will edit those slightly before
*13:29.280- 13:33.840* :  they post them on social media. So many people will think this was an entirely normal thing to do.
*13:34.040- 13:38.940* :  The photo grabbed the attention of the world because there is so much interest in her health,
*13:38.940- 13:44.240* :  how is she doing? Well of course we know very little about that. There's been intense speculation,
*13:44.380- 13:48.860* :  but the picture release yesterday appeared to show her looking very healthy. It was a picture
*13:48.900- 13:54.460* :  of health really. We are waiting for further confirmation of when she will be coming back to
*13:54.460- 13:59.620* :  public duties. We have been led to believe that will be after Easter. We're expecting to see
*13:59.620- 14:03.780* :  her next month, but we haven't been given any confirmation of the date that she will be coming
*14:03.780- 14:07.640* :  back to public duties. Today of course there will be Commonwealth Day celebrations. We're
*14:07.680- 14:11.900* :  expecting to see Prince William out and about, so I'm sure there'll be more questions for him.
*14:14.620- 14:20.700* :  A technical event during the flight caused a strong movement. That was how the airline
*14:20.700- 14:26.100* :  Latin described how one of its flights from Sydney to Auckland suddenly dipped in the air. 50
*14:26.100- 14:32.480* :  people were injured, some were taken to hospital. Brian Jocat was on board and was not injured.
*14:32.480- 14:39.280* :  He's now in Auckland and has been talking to the BBC. The plane unannounced just dropped.
*14:39.280- 14:46.220* :  I mean it dropped unlike anything I've ever experienced on any kind of minor turbulence.
*14:47.240- 14:53.600* :  And people were thrown out of their seats, hit the top of the roof of the plane, thrown down
*14:53.600- 15:00.720* :  the aisles. It was madness. The gentleman sitting next to me basically was lifted out of his seat
*15:00.720- 15:07.240* :  and he was on the inside basically stretched out and I looked up and I thought I was dreaming
*15:07.940- 15:12.940* :  because I was in a bit of a sleep when I woke up from this and I looked up and noticed
*15:12.940- 15:17.900* :  what's going on here and then he just dropped to the floor. I looked over my shoulder just to see
*15:17.900- 15:24.040* :  what else was going on and some of the roof panels were broken from people being thrown up and
*15:24.040- 15:29.140* :  knocking through the plastic roof panels in the aisleways. And there was blood coming from
*15:29.140- 15:35.760* :  several people's heads and people were yelling and screaming and it was chaos. The plane actually
*15:35.820- 15:42.120* :  dropped and then it felt as if the year that the apex of a roller coaster coming over the top
*15:42.120- 15:48.320* :  and heading down and then it's straight enough right away. I just felt for all of the injured people
*15:48.320- 15:55.380* :  because then a couple of passengers let it be known they were doctors and they started to circulate
*15:55.380- 16:00.780* :  to bandage people up and stop the bleeding of some people and put neck races and other people
*16:00.780- 16:07.800* :  that were severely injured and once we landed it was like elation but it was dead silent from the
*16:07.800- 16:15.800* :  people that were okay and the other people they were just constantly in pain. passenger Brian
*16:15.800- 16:25.520* :  jocat still to come in the global news podcast my personal feeling is that it is probably one of
*16:25.520- 16:29.680* :  the biggest addictions in the world and it's the only addiction of course just about that you get
*16:29.680- 16:35.260* :  marked positively for you know you get points for it we hear how a worker holic dealt with his
*16:35.260- 16:46.860* :  addiction and says it needs to be taken more seriously it all started with me asking my friends
*16:46.860- 16:52.340* :  and family to write letters to my daughter Coco sharing their experiences and giving her advice
*16:52.340- 16:58.880* :  for her life ahead the idea blossomed into dear daughter from the BBC World Service the podcast

*21:42.660- 21:47.880* :  nevertheless even in the total collapse of law and order people are still venturing out to make
*21:47.880- 21:54.080* :  a living amid the chaos these market sellers see no other option than to leave their homes
*21:54.080- 22:02.100* :  even while gunmen roam the streets i have three kids and their mother and their father some
*22:02.100- 22:08.600* :  obliged to take to the streets yesterday gunmen came here and stole all our money a lot of vendors
*22:08.600- 22:13.140* :  lost all of their money but there's no way to stay at home and you have three mouths to feed
*22:13.180- 22:21.420* :  what can you do i don't feel good my children don't either the anxiety is killing me when i'm
*22:21.420- 22:26.740* :  in the street i keep thinking what if i get shot dead who will take care of my children then
*22:26.740- 22:36.000* :  i have no family to support me an already chaotic and deeply dangerous situation in porto
*22:36.020- 22:41.080* :  prince was worsened by the escape of around four thousand inmates after the gangs attacked the
*22:41.080- 22:47.120* :  city's main prison in the aftermath cell doors are wide open the facility is virtually abandoned

*22:58.080- 23:03.560* :  off the streets all in all this adds up to a picture of a nation about as close to a failed state
*23:03.560- 23:14.220* :  as it's possible to be will grant there's a spate of kidnappings in Nigeria at the moment with
*23:14.220- 23:19.520* :  hundreds of school children still missing after three separate attacks now a government agency
*23:19.520- 23:25.100* :  says schools in 14 states that's nearly half the country available to such abductions
*23:25.180- 23:31.600* :  africa original editor Richard Hamilton told me more about what the agency said this agency was
*23:31.600- 23:39.300* :  created after the notorious chibok abduction almost exactly ten years ago they have collected data
*23:39.300- 23:46.200* :  looking at all these kidnappings over the years and the recent spate as you say and they've listed
*23:46.720- 23:51.740* :  14 states are not going to go through all of them but they're mainly ones in the north of the
*23:51.740- 24:01.000* :  country like katcina sokato plato zampara borno and as well as the capital abduja and they're saying
*24:01.000- 24:07.480* :  that they will heighten security and there'll be more patrols but it'll be difficult for them to
*24:07.480- 24:13.220* :  security guards in every school in the country and some of them are in remote villages so it's
*24:13.220- 24:17.540* :  quite difficult to see what they what they'll do next but they are looking at the problem
*24:18.100- 24:24.420* :  and saying they're going to increase security what is causing this up surge in kidnappings and
*24:24.420- 24:32.600* :  who's carrying them out yes so the Nigerian economy is in a dire situation the currency is plummeting
*24:32.600- 24:38.360* :  the cost of living has gone up inflation's gone up people can't really afford to make a living
*24:38.980- 24:45.580* :  and so many people are resorting to criminal activities so in many cases these are kidnappings for
*24:45.580- 24:52.460* :  ransom by criminal gangs and we suspect although officially paying a ransom has been outlawed we
*24:52.460- 24:58.360* :  suspect that negotiations are going on behind the scenes in other cases for example in the recent one
*24:58.360- 25:06.040* :  last Thursday in caduna state where more than 280 school girls were abducted it's thought that
*25:06.040- 25:12.000* :  these are islamist militants for example and saru that is linked to al-Qaeda and then further
*25:12.000- 25:18.060* :  east a book of haram operates but they've not claimed responsibility yet Richard Hamilton
*25:19.180- 25:24.780* :  the center right democratic alliance party has narrowly won the snap election in Portugal which
*25:24.780- 25:31.280* :  was triggered when the prime minister Antonio Costa resigned amid corruption allegations his party the
*25:31.280- 25:38.060* :  socialists came second only the far right shagour could claim a clear cut success quadrupling it
*25:38.060- 25:43.780* :  seats in parliament the democratic alliance is the biggest single party but didn't win an absolute
*25:43.780- 25:50.540* :  majority still its leader Louis Montenegro has ruled out any deal with shagour which he's previously
*25:50.540- 25:59.400* :  described as racist we know the challenge is great we know that it will require a great sense of
*25:59.400- 26:05.200* :  responsibility from everyone we know that it will require from us and be in particular a great
*26:05.200- 26:14.620* :  capacity for dialogue and democratic tolerance so what options are available to mr. Montenegro and
*26:14.620- 26:20.820* :  the democratic alliance a question i pose to the bbc's allyson robert's in lesbian the election
*26:20.820- 26:26.720* :  is theoretically not over yet because there are four seats elected by emigrant voters portuguese
*26:26.720- 26:30.500* :  living abroad that have yet to be decided and probably won't be in until about the 20th of March
*26:30.500- 26:36.600* :  that may or may not affect the final result probably the democratic alliance will still be ahead
*26:37.280- 26:42.320* :  and but it will have to go on alone but the question is how long because given that the leader
*26:42.320- 26:47.600* :  has said that he will not talk to shagour and it is expected that the president of the country who's
*26:47.600- 26:54.920* :  above party politics will hold him to that very public pledge the question is how long can a minority
*26:54.920- 27:01.280* :  government survive when it will want to for example put forward an amending budget to change all
*27:01.280- 27:06.360* :  the things that the socialist government has had in place and then later in the year it's going to
*27:06.360- 27:11.360* :  have to table a budget of its own for next year and where is it going to get those votes for to get
*27:11.360- 27:19.440* :  that budget through if not from shagour so why this big surge in support for shagour well it's
*27:19.440- 27:26.780* :  been coming for a few years mr ventorde himself was first elected in 2019 and at that time he was
*27:26.780- 27:32.980* :  the sole member of parliament for shagour in 2022 when we had another election he bumped that up
*27:32.980- 27:41.180* :  to 12 seats and he's now on 48 so literally quadrupling the number of seats and really doing
*27:41.180- 27:46.600* :  very well particularly in the south of the country which is the old stamping ground of Portugal's
*27:46.600- 27:51.940* :  century old communist party which has really faded in recent years so the communists were to an
*27:51.940- 27:56.720* :  extent something of a protest vote against the two main parties perhaps that's been taken over by
*27:56.720- 28:03.080* :  shagour and indeed shagour in the algarve region that was the most voted party so there are
*28:03.080- 28:09.920* :  clearly some regional factors here but in general given that the level of extension went down
*28:09.920- 28:15.420* :  very sharply many commentators are saying well these are a lot of discontented people who are sick
*28:15.420- 28:19.860* :  of the two main parties and no one to vote for shagour but of course we can't say that for sure
*28:19.860- 28:25.440* :  until we see studies saying exactly who these people are and whether they voted at all last time
*28:25.440- 28:32.060* :  or indeed voted for another party Alison Roberts in Lisbon now are you obsessed with working
*28:32.060- 28:37.880* :  spending long excessive hours in the office and finding it difficult to stop thinking about work
*28:37.880- 28:44.500* :  well the British writer James Graham has told the BBC about attending workaholics anonymous for
*28:44.500- 28:50.620* :  his addiction which he claims is not treated as seriously as when people are hooked on drugs
*28:50.620- 28:58.340* :  or alcohol I think the moment I realised I had a problem was I started to lie to my family
*28:58.340- 29:04.780* :  my friends about stupid things that didn't even need lying about like there would go you look
*29:04.780- 29:09.440* :  tired what time did you get up today to work and I would say oh you know eight and I say to myself
*29:09.440- 29:15.200* :  I know I got a bit five that's really weird why'd I why'd I say that or I wouldn't have eaten
*29:15.200- 29:23.500* :  for like a whole day the writer James Graham Gary from workaholics anonymous told his story to
*29:23.500- 29:32.620* :  my colleague Amal Rajan I was working as an executive in media and I think it got to the stage where I
*29:32.620- 29:40.300* :  was so obsessed with work that I had got myself into a kind of mindset that I just wasn't doing
*29:40.300- 29:45.620* :  enough and that if I wasn't superhuman and you know living up to my nickname of the dragon slayer
*29:45.980- 29:51.400* :  and bringing in millions of pounds worth of work that everyone was talking about me and that I
*29:51.400- 29:54.820* :  was going to be sacked I'd even sort of thought well it'd be perfectly reasonable if they called
*29:54.820- 29:59.540* :  the police and accused me of fraud because it simply wasn't bringing in enough work you know so I
*29:59.540- 30:04.340* :  thought I'll be preemptive and resigned and then when I resigned people were just like shocked and
*30:04.340- 30:09.140* :  thought but we love having you here you're the grown up you're the adult you hold the place together
*30:09.460- 30:14.460* :  we need you my personal feeling is is that it is probably one of the biggest addictions in the
*30:14.460- 30:19.420* :  world and it's the only addiction of course just about that you get marks positively for you know
*30:19.420- 30:24.820* :  you get points for it you know alcoholism and drug addiction have got the kind of moral sort of
*30:24.820- 30:29.540* :  bad image but workaholism yeah what's the treatment and what have you pursued as treatment
*30:29.800- 30:35.660* :  workaholics anonymous is very like alcoholics anonymous based on that and largely it's a program
*30:35.660- 30:41.160* :  of just other workaholics helping each other to realize that it is actually okay to take five
*30:41.160- 30:46.140* :  minutes of reality go for a pee break it is actually okay to sit your boss at half past six I'm sorry
*30:46.140- 30:51.060* :  but I have to leave you know just putting in simple boundaries what is a good amount of hours to work
*30:51.060- 30:56.020* :  a week what's you know the absolute maximum I'll work all of those things are very simple but for
*30:56.020- 31:01.420* :  a workaholics whose head is full of I need approval from my authority figures you need the support
*31:01.420- 31:07.720* :  of a group to say no no it's okay keep going keep learning to relax there is so much shame and
*31:07.720- 31:13.120* :  sense of self and self esteem wrapped up and work that it's when you're with a bunch of people
*31:13.120- 31:18.200* :  who are very similar kind of warped mindset shall we say that you start to think yeah well these
*31:18.200- 31:23.000* :  people are like me they get where my crazy heads coming from and how are you now Gary oh great
*31:23.000- 31:27.540* :  you know I've been doing this for 14 years and I've retired which for a workaholic is another
*31:27.660- 31:33.040* :  another kind of challenge shall we say you know because you don't have to have a job to be a
*31:33.040- 31:39.360* :  workaholic you can run around with far too many hobbies Gary from workaholics anonymous so we've
*31:39.360- 31:45.100* :  been talking about the Oscars and now we're going to end this podcast hearing from another movie star
*31:45.100- 31:50.940* :  but it's not to do with Hollywood it's to do with green energy in Africa the actor in question
*31:50.940- 31:57.580* :  is Idris Elba who's leading a regeneration project in Sierra Leone it's an eco city on the rural
*31:57.580- 32:02.980* :  Chevrolet island off the coast of West Africa with a wind and solar farm fewer than a third of homes
*32:02.980- 32:08.820* :  in Sierra Leone have electricity our business reporter David Waddle asked Idris Elba why
*32:08.820- 32:14.480* :  Chevrolet island was chosen originally we went there looking at how can we bring tourism to the
*32:14.680- 32:20.320* :  most incredible 19 miles of beach fund that was there and then we saw something a bit more
*32:20.320- 32:25.460* :  innovative but more exciting was this idea of building a sort of eco smart city preserving
*32:26.240- 32:31.660* :  what's beautiful about it but in the same time attracting partners to help build it out if you'd
*32:31.660- 32:37.940* :  like and explore it so that's how it came about this is essentially a commercial project I guess
*32:37.940- 32:42.280* :  you're looking at profits we'll see early on the people see early on see those profits when you
*32:42.280- 32:47.300* :  talk about profits it's really about are we ever going to make a profit I don't think so but it's
*32:47.300- 32:52.480* :  about being self-reliance about bringing an economy that feeds itself that has growth potential
*32:53.100- 33:00.060* :  I'm very keen to sort of reframe the way Africa was viewed we often view the framing of Africa
*33:00.060- 33:07.300* :  as an aid model and this opportunity is completely different Chevrolet island is somewhere that
*33:07.520- 33:11.020* :  until now it's been focused on fishing and agriculture you and I talking about developing
*33:11.020- 33:15.260* :  a tourism industry is this somewhere I should be looking at for our next family holiday
*33:15.260- 33:23.180* :  yes we want to find a destination in West Africa that attracts business as well as
*33:23.180- 33:30.140* :  holiday makers as well as innovation I'm a filmmaker I have a dream to have a really amazing film
*33:30.140- 33:37.160* :  studio there that has a sort of universal studios type themes and my rollercoaster is over there
*33:37.160- 33:43.520* :  and my my movie over there I think you and your family will go to a place where there's winter sun
*33:44.060- 33:49.580* :  it's seven hours away from Europe for the most part and it's beautiful and Idris what is it
*33:49.720- 33:54.080* :  that's inspired you to learn not just your passion but also your name to a project like this never
*33:54.080- 34:00.720* :  in my lifetime would I have thought I could help build the foundation for a new smart city no I'm
*34:00.720- 34:06.460* :  not qualified for that but I am qualified to dream big and my parents came to this country when
*34:06.460- 34:13.020* :  they were young late 60s with the aspirations of going home I'm on still alive but my dad isn't
*34:13.480- 34:18.140* :  to part of me wants to build that beautiful retirement home for my mom where she can go back and say
*34:18.140- 34:24.220* :  wow my little guy that was born in Hackney came back home and built this incredible island and
*34:24.760- 34:31.080* :  it's a dream but I I work in the make-believe business and and it's exactly that make-believe
