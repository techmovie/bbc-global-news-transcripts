*00:20.600- 00:22.920* :  Because I can't wear the same suit for fine dining

*01:39.880- 01:43.200* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:45.800- 01:49.160* :  I'm Rachel Wright and in the early hours of Thursday 7th of March,
*01:49.160- 01:50.620* :  these are our main stories.
*01:50.620- 01:54.060* :  South Africa has petitioned the International Court of Justice
*01:54.060- 01:57.000* :  to impose new emergency measures on Israel,
*01:57.360- 02:00.660* :  citing what it described as widespread starvation in Gaza.
*02:01.360- 02:04.480* :  Ukraine's southern city of Odessa has been hit by a deadly
*02:04.480- 02:07.620* :  missile strike during a visit by President Zelensky
*02:07.620- 02:10.240* :  and the Greek Prime Minister, Kyrie Acosmitz Atakis.
*02:10.940- 02:14.260* :  A thousand National Guard soldiers and police officers are to be
*02:14.260- 02:16.720* :  deployed to patrol New York City subway
*02:17.040- 02:18.820* :  to help tackle violent crime.
*02:21.720- 02:22.960* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:24.980- 02:29.520* :  Of course, there is a certain curiosity as to what they would have thought of this,
*02:29.520- 02:32.300* :  but they did not participate in this decision.
*02:33.160- 02:37.020* :  A new book is published by the sons of a late great Colombian author
*02:37.340- 02:38.940* :  against the wishes of their parents.
*02:43.840- 02:46.740* :  South Africa has asked the International Court of Justice
*02:46.740- 02:50.740* :  to order emergency measures against Israel over its war in Gaza,
*02:51.160- 02:54.400* :  warning that starvation for Palestinians must no longer a threat,
*02:54.400- 02:55.440* :  but a reality.
*02:55.980- 03:00.000* :  This is the second time Pretoria has asked the Court to take action in the war.
*03:00.000- 03:05.740* :  In February, a call to order Israel to halt an offensive against the city of Rafa was denied.
*03:05.820- 03:09.420* :  I got more from our correspondent in the Hague and a Holigen.
*03:09.760- 03:16.060* :  South Africa accuses Israel of repeatedly using humanitarian aid as a bargaining chip in negotiations,
*03:17.000- 03:20.920* :  creating hostile, inoperable environments for aid agencies,
*03:21.600- 03:27.760* :  blocking aid deliveries, creating restrictions and denials, close crossings,
*03:28.400- 03:31.380* :  deliberately targeting and killing humanitarian workers,
*03:32.180- 03:35.580* :  and destroying Palestinian crops and arable land.
*03:35.580- 03:36.900* :  I'm just reading through these here.
*03:37.480- 03:41.040* :  Forcing Palestinian men, women and children to eat animal feed,
*03:41.040- 03:42.640* :  bird seed and leaves.
*03:42.700- 03:46.740* :  And of course, Israel has denied targeting humanitarian workers.
*03:47.340- 03:49.940* :  I mean, South Africa is a real leading voice in this.
*03:49.940- 03:51.140* :  Does it have support?
*03:51.740- 03:53.620* :  There is widespread support,
*03:53.620- 03:56.900* :  but what we've seen in this case over the last couple of months
*03:57.020- 04:00.960* :  is how the kind of global community is divided,
*04:00.960- 04:04.220* :  and we have seen Israel's allies like the U.S.
*04:04.220- 04:08.100* :  Of course, object to this case initially,
*04:08.800- 04:10.860* :  but now as the situation is changing,
*04:10.860- 04:13.060* :  their positions have become more dynamic.
*04:13.800- 04:18.520* :  And that's really pushing the pressure on this court, actually,
*04:18.520- 04:22.120* :  because more and more countries are seeing international justice
*04:22.120- 04:25.540* :  as a means to wield real power on the ground.
*04:25.540- 04:28.000* :  And this is one of the first situations in which
*04:28.880- 04:30.780* :  they're dealing with an active conflict.
*04:30.780- 04:33.100* :  This isn't international justice in retrospect.
*04:33.160- 04:35.200* :  This is in real time.
*04:35.400- 04:37.340* :  And so the pressure is on the court now.
*04:37.340- 04:40.180* :  And just towards the end of this document,
*04:40.720- 04:46.820* :  South Africa draws parallels with the situation in Bosnia in the 1990s
*04:46.920- 04:52.960* :  and points out that Bosnia came to the ICJ in 1993
*04:52.960- 04:57.400* :  and asked for a similar ruling to prevent genocide.
*04:58.200- 04:59.800* :  That request was rejected.
*04:59.800- 05:05.660* :  And in 1995, genocide was committed in Srebrenica.
*05:06.020- 05:09.580* :  And what South Africa says just at the end of this submission
*05:10.600- 05:14.680* :  is that the court must act now to prevent another genocide.
*05:14.700- 05:20.240* :  But what the court has to weigh up now is whether the situation has changed enough
*05:21.200- 05:23.840* :  since their original provisional measures were issued
*05:23.840- 05:28.280* :  to justify issuing more as South Africa has requested here.
*05:28.800- 05:30.200* :  Anaholegon in the Hague.
*05:30.860- 05:34.360* :  There's been another deadly Russian missile strike in the Southern Ukrainian
*05:34.360- 05:37.460* :  port city of Odessa this time during a visit
*05:37.460- 05:40.300* :  by the Greek Prime Minister Kiryakos Mitsotakis.
*05:42.760- 05:44.540* :  Captured there, the sound of the attack,
*05:44.540- 05:46.940* :  which happened just a few hundred meters away
*05:46.940- 05:51.380* :  from where Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky was showing Mr. Mitsotakis
*05:51.380- 05:52.260* :  around the port.
*05:52.960- 05:55.100* :  No one from either delegation was hurt,
*05:55.100- 05:56.660* :  but five people have died.
*05:57.240- 05:59.060* :  I spoke to Vitaly Shchevchenko,
*05:59.060- 06:02.420* :  a Russian editor at BBC Monitoring about what had happened.
*06:03.000- 06:06.800* :  They were at the port, seeing the infrastructure,
*06:07.360- 06:10.680* :  when they heard sirens and explosions.
*06:11.240- 06:12.800* :  According to Mr. Mitsotakis,
*06:13.580- 06:16.100* :  they didn't really have time to take cover.
*06:16.840- 06:20.560* :  And he described it as a very intense experience.
*06:21.380- 06:25.380* :  Now afterwards, President Zelensky described the attack.
*06:25.960- 06:30.660* :  And he said and I quote that Russia had either gone crazy
*06:31.240- 06:33.160* :  or lost control of its army.
*06:33.740- 06:38.660* :  Now we have to remember that Odessa has been under
*06:39.260- 06:43.200* :  relentless Russian attack for more than a week now.
*06:43.940- 06:47.040* :  The two leaders visited an apartment block,
*06:47.780- 06:53.020* :  which was hit by a Russian drone in the early hours of Saturday.
*06:53.680- 06:57.340* :  And 12 people died, five of them children.
*06:58.280- 07:05.080* :  So what happens is yet another attack on this really important Ukrainian city.
*07:05.620- 07:09.680* :  Given that, why do you think that the two leaders were there,
*07:09.680- 07:11.300* :  it's a dangerous place to be?
*07:12.420- 07:15.240* :  It was an act of bravery, that's true.
*07:15.700- 07:22.740* :  President Zelensky has been on numerous visits to really dangerous places.
*07:22.860- 07:28.580* :  Of course, no place within Ukraine is completely safe,
*07:28.580- 07:35.480* :  but he's made a point of visiting front-line towns and villages just a few
*07:35.480- 07:38.140* :  hundreds of meters away from Russian forces.
*07:38.860- 07:44.780* :  And of course, Russia has attacked places where they know foreign dignities are.
*07:45.960- 07:55.040* :  It has, in April 2022, Kiev was bombed when the UN Secretary-General Antonia Guterrish
*07:55.320- 08:01.460* :  was there, and the UN delegation said they were shocked by this act.
*08:01.460- 08:06.800* :  And it would appear that this can be part of Russia's strategy,
*08:07.400- 08:14.760* :  undeterred, unapologetic and relentlessly targeting Ukrainian cities,
*08:15.700- 08:20.520* :  regardless of who's there, foreign dignitaries or civilians or children.
*08:21.020- 08:26.740* :  And of course, the Russian Defence Ministry said it was targeting a maritime drone facility.
*08:26.740- 08:27.820* :  Is that plausible?
*08:28.940- 08:37.020* :  It is plausible, but it may or may not be true, because a Russian doesn't really have a track
*08:37.020- 08:41.220* :  record of being completely truthful when it comes to these attacks.
*08:41.240- 08:45.800* :  It's denied targeting civilian infrastructure consistently,
*08:46.660- 08:51.820* :  and be Ukraine doesn't reveal what's being targeted.
*08:51.820- 08:56.020* :  In fact, it's an offense to disclose immediately after these attacks
*08:56.480- 09:01.420* :  that such and such military facility or civilian facility has been targeted.
*09:01.980- 09:05.180* :  So there's a shroud of secrecy surrounding these attacks,
*09:05.180- 09:08.360* :  which is only to be expected at a time of war.
*09:11.180- 09:16.300* :  When Alan Scott went to work as a conductor on New York City's Subway Network last week,
*09:16.740- 09:21.020* :  he hadn't expected it to be different from the past 24 years in the job.
*09:21.740- 09:26.980* :  But that day, his neck was slashed in a violent attack, and he vowed he would never go on
*09:26.980- 09:32.800* :  the underground again. It's one of many altercations and killings on the transport service recently,
*09:32.800- 09:37.500* :  so the authorities have announced a new measure. They'll be sending a thousand
*09:37.500- 09:41.040* :  national guard soldiers and state police officers on patrol there.
*09:41.580- 09:45.240* :  The task force will check platforms and passengers' bags for weapons.
*09:45.240- 09:49.260* :  Governor Kathy Hocal gave details at a news conference.
*09:49.680- 09:52.920* :  We're focusing on repeated fenders, deterring crime,
*09:53.920- 09:59.180* :  and protecting the people in our subways, because no one heading to their job or to visit
*09:59.520- 10:03.760* :  family or go to a doctor appointment should worry that the person sitting next to them possesses
*10:03.760- 10:08.160* :  a deadly weapon. They shouldn't worry about whether someone's going to brandish a knife or gun.
*10:08.820- 10:13.140* :  That's what we're going to do with these checkpoints. These subway uses gave their thoughts.
*10:14.000- 10:19.580* :  I think it would kind of deter some things that have been happening. I've certainly noticed a
*10:19.580- 10:26.420* :  difference in crime and subways that even have me as an NYPD employee fearful of my safety.
*10:26.760- 10:33.520* :  I think it's not a wonderful use of our resources to be putting national guard into our subways.
*10:33.880- 10:38.900* :  We should be providing those resources to supporting folks who are homeless,
*10:38.900- 10:42.700* :  to our new immigrant families who are coming into the city.
*10:42.880- 10:45.800* :  I think it's worse than ever. It's been getting worse in the last couple of years.
*10:46.520- 10:52.060* :  And since their ridership seems to still be down from COVID, you feel a little alone down there.
*10:52.940- 10:57.440* :  Subway users in New York City are new measures to tackle violent crime.
*10:58.520- 11:04.500* :  It was described by one politician as an alleged act of vigilantism that instilled terror into
*11:04.500- 11:10.820* :  young children. Now, police in Western Australia have called for calm after a video circulating on
*11:10.820- 11:15.980* :  social media showed a six-year-old girl and a seven-year-old boy with their hands tied,
*11:15.980- 11:21.020* :  crying and cowering in terror in a driveway as a large man stands nearby.
*11:21.100- 11:27.120* :  The children are from the Aboriginal community. The man is white. He's now being charged with
*11:27.120- 11:32.720* :  aggravated assault. The premiere of Western Australia and Roger Cook echoed the police call.
*11:33.040- 11:37.420* :  Anyone that saw that video would have found it confronting,
*11:38.280- 11:43.700* :  would have found it disturbing. And I understand that it raises very strong emotions in everyone
*11:43.700- 11:50.040* :  in the community. But I urge everyone, let the police get on and do their job. Let the justice
*11:50.040- 11:56.540* :  process take place. Our correspondent in Sydney Phil Mercer spoke to Jean-Atter-Leal about the
*11:56.540- 12:02.780* :  incident. Well, the police say that this happened in the seaside town of Broome, which is about
*12:02.780- 12:09.760* :  2,000 kilometres to the north of Perth in Western Australia. They received one telephone call
*12:10.440- 12:17.000* :  from a neighbour saying that there were children in a pool in a vacant property. They then received
*12:17.000- 12:24.000* :  another call about 10 minutes later from a 45-year-old man who said that he had restrained
*12:24.380- 12:31.120* :  three children for allegedly causing damage. Now when the police officers reached the property
*12:31.120- 12:38.360* :  they found allegedly two Aboriginal children tied up with cable ties in the driveway
*12:38.380- 12:45.500* :  of a house at cable beach, which is a very popular place for tourists in Broome. And the officers
*12:45.500- 12:52.620* :  believe that a third Aboriginal child was also restrained but managed to escape. The children
*12:52.620- 12:58.900* :  have been checked over by paramedics and reunited with their families. And what's been the reaction
*12:58.900- 13:05.920* :  in Australia to this? Well, senior state officials in Western Australia say that they are appalled by
*13:05.920- 13:13.340* :  some of the footage that has been shared on social media politicians say that the video was
*13:13.340- 13:20.840* :  disturbing and confronting. So this will once again highlight the treatment of Aboriginal children
*13:21.340- 13:27.660* :  in Australia when it comes to the criminal justice system. First Nations Australians aged
*13:27.660- 13:37.860* :  between 10 and 17 are 29 times, 29 times more likely to be in detention than their non-indigenous
*13:37.860- 13:44.320* :  counterparts. And of course this alleged act of vigilantism doesn't concern the criminal justice
*13:44.320- 13:50.860* :  system in terms of those children. But once again this alleged incident does shine a light on the way
*13:50.860- 13:58.020* :  that Aboriginal children are sometimes treated by the broader community. Filmers are in Australia.
*13:58.780- 14:04.720* :  We thought we'd close the final chapter on the work of Nobel Prize-winning author Gabrielle García
*14:04.720- 14:10.840* :  Marquez when he died 10 years ago. But a new book until August was released on Wednesday.
*14:11.400- 14:17.940* :  The Lost Novel is being published by his sons Gonzalo and Rodrigo Garcia Barcha, despite his
*14:17.940- 14:22.740* :  request for it to be destroyed. Our culture reporter Yasmine Rufo has the story.
*14:23.240- 14:28.580* :  Which you go against the last wishes of your parents? Directly do something that they asked you
*14:28.580- 14:34.360* :  not to do. Well, that's what Gonzalo and Rodrigo have done. They have published a novel he wrote
*14:34.360- 14:40.440* :  over a decade ago while struggling with dementia. Gonzalo told the BBC he wasn't sure what to do
*14:40.440- 14:45.500* :  with the novel at first, but destroying it was not an option. Of course we didn't destroy it.
*14:45.760- 14:52.700* :  We weren't sure what we were going to do with it, but definitely destroying it was not in our plans.
*14:52.700- 15:00.980* :  About a couple of years ago, 2022, we came back to the book and we didn't find it as disastrous
*15:00.980- 15:06.860* :  as Gabel had judged it. The book is also unique in that it's the first of García's novels to
*15:06.860- 15:12.440* :  center on a female protagonist. Until August tells the story of a middle-aged woman who travels
*15:12.440- 15:17.600* :  alone to an island every summer to visit her mother's grave. And during each trip takes a new
*15:17.600- 15:25.900* :  lover, despite being happily married. We decided that maybe Gabel wasn't in a position to judge
*15:25.900- 15:31.740* :  his work. You know, he could only see the flaws. The story, which is very different to some of his
*15:31.740- 15:37.100* :  most beloved novels, such as 100 years of solitude, has received mixed reviews from critics.
*15:37.800- 15:42.560* :  With one concluding that his family and publishers should have respected his wishes as he was
*15:42.560- 15:48.140* :  right to have never wanted this book to see the light of day. García Marquez's book is not the
*15:48.140- 15:54.260* :  first novel to be published posthumously against the author's demands. The likes of Franz Kafka of
*15:54.260- 15:59.860* :  Vladimir Nabokov and Virgil have all had works published after their death, despite asking friends
*15:59.860- 16:05.280* :  and family to burn their stories. Gonzalo told a press conference in Madrid, but of course he
*16:05.280- 16:13.240* :  wonders what his late father would have made of his decision. Of course, there is a certain curiosity
*16:13.240- 16:18.680* :  as to what they would have thought of this of what we put together now, but they did not participate
*16:19.260- 16:24.400* :  in this decision. However, he says that him and his brother are certain that they have made the
*16:24.400- 16:30.360* :  right choice in publishing this novel. We decided that, you know, we'd give it a shot at giving our
*16:30.360- 16:36.840* :  version of what Gabel's work would look like. This is really the Gabel's last work. There's
*16:36.840- 16:42.000* :  nothing else in the drawer. You know, this is the last thing that he was working on.
*16:42.300- 16:48.500* :  That report by Yasmine Rufo. Still to come on this podcast.
*16:55.040- 16:59.920* :  A film about a prominent Nazi gets its first screening in a former concentration camp.

*17:32.620- 17:43.260* :  podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News podcast. In recent years, the Spanish authorities have
*17:43.260- 17:49.360* :  investigated several top footballers on tax fraud accusations, with some cases resulting in
*17:49.360- 17:55.740* :  millions of dollars in fines. Now prosecutors are seeking a jail sentence of nearly five years
*17:55.740- 18:01.700* :  for the Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, over alleged undeclared earnings of more than a
*18:01.700- 18:06.140* :  million dollars. The newsroom's Nigel Adely has more about the allegations.
*18:06.840- 18:14.920* :  They relate to his first fell in charge of the club in 2014 and 2015, and the Madrid community
*18:14.920- 18:20.720* :  prosecutors' office have accused of creating a confusing and complex system of shell companies
*18:20.720- 18:28.260* :  to hide extra earnings. Now Ancelotti was paying tax on the wages he was getting from Real Madrid,
*18:28.260- 18:32.880* :  his football club, but he was also earning money for the club as well for image rights,
*18:33.300- 18:38.920* :  which are often negotiated separately to the core contract, and they relate to the image being
*18:38.920- 18:46.280* :  used of the person in merchandise and promotion, and that sort of thing. And the allegation is that
*18:46.280- 18:52.900* :  this money was hidden away in these shell companies, and tax wasn't paid on it. Now there's been no
*18:52.900- 18:58.420* :  comment from Ancelotti's legal team or the club so far, but the prosecutors in Spain believe
*18:58.420- 19:05.160* :  they have a solid case. So how extensive is the Spanish tax authorities' pursuit of footballers
*19:05.160- 19:10.960* :  and top earners in sport? Well, they've been going after celebrities as well as sport stars in
*19:10.960- 19:18.300* :  Spain now over many years, because I think they became frustrated that a number of top sport stars
*19:18.300- 19:22.960* :  and also an entertainment and other walks of life were being paid huge sums of money,
*19:23.480- 19:27.700* :  but on large portions of that we're not paying tax because it was being squirreled away
*19:27.740- 19:33.720* :  into offshore tax companies, and we've seen two of the most famous footballers in the world also
*19:33.720- 19:41.280* :  be prosecuted by the Spanish tax authorities in 2017. Leonardo Messi was given a 21-month jail
*19:41.280- 19:47.060* :  sentence. That was reduced to a fine. He was found guilty of defrauding Spain at nearly five million
*19:47.060- 19:54.340* :  dollars during his time at Barcelona, and Cristiano Ronaldo also accepted a fine of over 20 million
*19:54.340- 20:00.660* :  dollars for tax evasion. Well, he was playing at Real Madrid, and he was also given a 23-month
*20:00.660- 20:07.080* :  jail sentence, but in Spain, convictions like that usually don't result in prison time, because
*20:07.080- 20:13.000* :  a first-time offender who gets less than two years tend to spend time on probation or pay a fine.
*20:13.000- 20:18.860* :  So effectively, Ronaldo's prison sentence was suspended. A number of sports stars have often
*20:18.860- 20:23.760* :  blamed advisors previously and said that these companies were set up without really their
*20:23.760- 20:28.500* :  knowledge, and although they were being paid the money, they were absolutely sure of where all
*20:28.500- 20:32.980* :  the money was going and how much tax was being paid, but clearly this doesn't wash with the
*20:32.980- 20:38.600* :  authorities in Spain, and now they're cracking down hard once again. The newsrooms Nigel Adely.
*20:39.440- 20:45.180* :  In a few days' time, the Holocaust era drama The Zone of Interest could make history by becoming
*20:45.180- 20:50.940* :  the first British film ever to win the Oscar for Best International Feature. The film, which has
*20:50.940- 20:56.540* :  five nominations, has become one of the most talked about of this award season. The authorities
*20:56.540- 21:01.580* :  at Auschwitz, where the film is set, recently held a special screening at the former concentration
*21:01.580- 21:07.840* :  camp to mark the official Polish premiere. Our reporter, Tom Brooke, was in the audience for the
*21:07.840- 21:16.160* :  screening of A24's film directed by Jonathan Glazer. It has the feel of experimental cinema,
*21:16.520- 21:21.080* :  an anthropological study of a man responsible for mass extermination, Rudolph Hearst,
*21:21.080- 21:26.540* :  the commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp. It observes him, his family, and their domestic
*21:26.540- 21:33.380* :  routines. The film's director, Jonathan Glazer, welcomed the audience to a special screening of the
*21:33.380- 21:41.360* :  Zone of Interest in the cinema hall at the former concentration camp. It's Jonathan Glazer's
*21:41.360- 21:48.140* :  first film in almost 10 years, a labor of love. He wanted authenticity. He wanted to shoot it at Auschwitz.
*21:48.480- 21:53.180* :  I felt that the film had to be about this place and the importance of this place.
*21:53.600- 21:58.640* :  But what really sets the director's film apart from standard Holocaust movies is its point of view.
*21:59.080- 22:03.840* :  The focus is not on those who suffered Auschwitz, but on the perpetrators. Chief among them,
*22:03.840- 22:08.520* :  Rudolph Hearst, the Nazi commandant of the camp, who lived with his family, a seemingly blissful
*22:08.520- 22:13.640* :  life in a house adjacent to the concentration camp. The audience at the special Auschwitz screening
*22:13.640- 22:18.100* :  were impressed by the film's unusual perspective and how it normalized the horrific.
*22:18.640- 22:25.480* :  You can see ordinary people, like a commandant of Auschwitz. He was typical ordinary men,
*22:25.480- 22:33.480* :  not a flying dragon, raising fire. He had family, his own life, and he was able to run the
*22:33.480- 22:42.640* :  biggest desk in Europe. One of the things that's incredibly powerful is how he uses sound to convey
*22:42.640- 22:49.820* :  the horror of the concentration camp. You hear the noises of Hearst's children playing joyfully
*22:50.380- 22:55.640* :  in the garden, combined with the suffering coming out of these buildings, people in pain,
*22:56.440- 23:03.460* :  gunfire. The just position of these sounds is truly horrifying and very powerful cinema.
*23:06.680- 23:13.520* :  Director Jonathan Glazer. Just try and show these people as people, not as monsters,
*23:13.900- 23:20.420* :  was a very important thing to do because human beings did this to other human beings and it's
*23:20.420- 23:25.200* :  very convenient for us to try and distance ourselves from them because we think we could never behave
*23:25.200- 23:30.320* :  this way, but I think we should be less certain in that. That report by Tom Brook.
*23:31.260- 23:36.780* :  A teacher in Bangladesh has now been formally suspended after shooting a student in the leg
*23:36.780- 23:43.100* :  during an altercation at school and faces lifetime imprisonment if convicted. The incident caused
*23:43.100- 23:48.680* :  outrage at the medical school in the city of Shiraj Ganges. The teacher in question was already
*23:48.680- 23:54.660* :  under review for erratic behaviour. Our Bangladesh correspondent Akbar Hussein has spoken to the
*23:54.660- 24:00.620* :  school and told Stephanie Prentice about what they'd said. They told me that there was an exam going
*24:00.620- 24:08.100* :  on in a classroom and the student he was asked a question and when he failed to answer that,
*24:08.100- 24:16.200* :  the teacher, he became very furious. At some point he just took his revolver from his bag
*24:16.200- 24:23.260* :  and shot him in his leg and he received a very bad injury and immediately he was taken to the
*24:23.260- 24:29.160* :  hospital and other students that became very scared and they called the emergency helpline,
*24:29.160- 24:33.860* :  triple line, to the police, then police came into the scene and they arrested the teacher.
*24:34.540- 24:40.260* :  And we know this teacher had previous, he had history of bringing weapons into the classroom.
*24:40.840- 24:43.540* :  Why wasn't it addressed before? What have the school said?
*24:44.060- 24:49.980* :  Basically, you know, in Bangladesh, you know, teachers are very powerful. So they can exercise
*24:49.980- 24:55.880* :  their powers over the students. The other students, they told me that arms are like a pet to him
*24:56.260- 25:02.820* :  because he used to keep, you know, arms in his bag. That was kind of his hobby. But they never
*25:03.380- 25:07.340* :  filed any complaint. So that's why medical college authorities that told me that there
*25:07.340- 25:12.360* :  didn't know anything about it. But the behavior of the teacher that was not up to the mark
*25:12.360- 25:17.900* :  because that was not student friendly. That's why he was cautioned several times. And last
*25:17.900- 25:22.900* :  month he was given the final warning that the way he was behaving with the students because
*25:22.900- 25:30.380* :  he became furious and he is not attending his classes properly and he is very rude to the students.
*25:30.380- 25:35.300* :  That's why he was given the final warning. And the police are looking into whether this gun
*25:35.800- 25:40.700* :  was being held legally because firearms are prohibited there. Yeah, it's absolutely
*25:40.700- 25:47.280* :  prohibited. I mean, if you want to have or keep any firearms in your position, you have to have
*25:47.580- 25:53.720* :  permission from the police because you have to show the reason that your life is at risk,
*25:54.000- 26:00.480* :  your life is under threat. So two cases have been filed. The one is keeping illegal firearms in
*26:00.480- 26:07.780* :  his position and other is attempt to murder. So if they are proven before the court, he might be
*26:07.780- 26:14.820* :  given life-taking imprisonment. Agba Hussein speaking to Stephanie Prentice. A statuette of the
*26:14.820- 26:21.800* :  Virgin Mary in central Italy can cry tears of blood. So said a self-proclaimed visionary who drew
*26:21.800- 26:28.060* :  large crowds to a small town north of Rome. Now that has been dismissed as fake by the Catholic
*26:28.060- 26:33.600* :  Church after it launched an investigation into the phenomenon last year as Alice Adley reports.
*26:34.240- 26:39.560* :  After an investigation involving Theologian's members of the clergy and followers of the cult
*26:39.560- 26:45.940* :  which sprang up around the statue, the diocese of Chivita Castelano near Rome has ruled there's
*26:45.940- 26:53.420* :  nothing supernatural about it. Since 2016, Giusella Cardia had claimed it cried tears of blood
*26:53.420- 27:00.140* :  and delivered a message to her direct from the Virgin Mary every third day. She'd been holding
*27:00.140- 27:06.840* :  large prayer meetings in front of a shrine she'd created in the town of Trevignano Romana much to
*27:06.840- 27:14.100* :  the annoyance of locals. Alice Adley. And finally, K-pop star Carina has issued an apology to angry
*27:14.100- 27:20.420* :  fans who accused her of betrayal because she has a boyfriend. The fans reportedly drove a truck
*27:20.420- 27:26.900* :  to the singer's agency after finding out she was dating actor Lige Uc. On the truck was an
*27:26.900- 27:33.240* :  electronic billboard which said, is the love given to you by your fans not enough? Correspondent Laura
*27:33.240- 27:39.940* :  Cress spoke to Luke Jones. Carina, as she said, she's the lead singer from this K-pop band Espa. She
*27:39.940- 27:44.740* :  gave this apology on her Instagram Tuesday night and that was a week after the news broke
*27:44.740- 27:50.840* :  of this new love life. She started very solemnly. She said, I'm sorry to have startled you. She
*27:50.840- 27:56.300* :  went on saying, I'm fully aware of how my M.Y.s are or my's that's the name of the Girl Group
*27:56.300- 28:01.220* :  fan club who have supported me would have been disappointed in me to think of all the stories
*28:01.220- 28:05.640* :  that we share together. She then says I'd like to make a men's for the hurt, of course,
*28:05.640- 28:11.200* :  saying she wants to heal the wounds and she wants to work harder to not let the fans down.
*28:11.200- 28:15.080* :  But I think it's safe to say even this apology hasn't really calmed them down.
*28:15.560- 28:19.200* :  And is this whole issue at all surprising in the world of K-pop?
*28:19.260- 28:23.780* :  It isn't. It's not really surprising in the world of pop I'd argue either but this is quite
*28:23.780- 28:28.920* :  an extreme example even in pop and specifically in K-pop. Don't forget it did used to be common
*28:28.920- 28:35.960* :  practice for K-pop agencies to actually ban new stars from dating. Even having a personal mobile
*28:36.300- 28:41.020* :  phone and so now these admissions of romantic relationships that often quite scandalous
*28:41.020- 28:44.360* :  even now to hear. And is there any support for her from her fans?
*28:44.740- 28:50.000* :  It's in the minority. I have to say looking through social media reaction to this. A lot of people
*28:50.000- 28:55.220* :  angry actually that she gave this apology on Instagram rather than something called Bubble
*28:55.220- 29:00.080* :  which is the private messaging service for fans and they pay a monthly subscription fee for that.
*29:00.120- 29:05.060* :  But I did find one message they said you don't need to apologise for feeling. I'll always
*29:05.100- 29:07.660* :  root for your happiness. Laura Cress
*29:10.640- 29:15.420* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*29:47.400- 29:51.260* :  Do you ever feel like money is just flying out of your account and you have no idea where it's going?
*29:51.260- 29:56.740* :  Well, I know. It's all of those subscriptions. I used rocket money to help me find out what
