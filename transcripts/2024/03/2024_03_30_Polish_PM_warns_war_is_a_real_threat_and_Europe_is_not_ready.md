*01:43.980- 01:48.660* :  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Saturday the 30th of March these are our main stories.
*01:48.660- 01:54.340* :  The Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk says Europe has entered a pre-war era and no one on the
*01:54.340- 02:00.400* :  continent will feel safe if Russia defeats Ukraine. A dissident Iranian journalist has been stabbed
*02:00.400- 02:05.460* :  outside his home in London. They've been protests against the police in a Mexican town where an
*02:05.460- 02:12.960* :  age-of-old girl was murdered earlier this week. Also in this podcast, if you have a legal
*02:12.960- 02:18.860* :  trade, you're ensuring that communities can benefit and you're also making sure that it's
*02:18.900- 02:24.580* :  conducted in a manner that is scientifically sustainable from a conservation point of view.
*02:24.580- 02:28.600* :  The South African government has enhanced a new wildlife protection plan which involves
*02:28.600- 02:36.920* :  encouraging people to eat more animals. The Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has delivered a
*02:36.920- 02:41.960* :  blunt warning that Europe has entered a pre-war era and if Ukraine is defeated by Russia,
*02:41.960- 02:47.560* :  no one on the continent will feel safe. War he told European media is a real threat.
*02:47.560- 02:53.880* :  His remarks came as a fresh barrage of Russian missiles targeted Ukraine taking out power supplies
*02:53.880- 02:59.700* :  in three areas. Yuri Sak is an advisor to the Ukrainian Defence Ministry. He said the air
*02:59.700- 03:04.420* :  defenses that Ukraine has are effective but they need more to protect people and infrastructure
*03:04.420- 03:10.760* :  from those Russian missiles. Unfortunately we haven't been able to intercept all of them as a result
*03:10.760- 03:18.100* :  of some hits on the energy infrastructure in different regions of Ukraine. It's quite
*03:18.100- 03:23.260* :  easy to understand how terrible this is because energy infrastructure when it's knocked down,
*03:23.260- 03:28.840* :  it means hospitals cannot work, it means banks cannot work, it means the whole country is put
*03:28.840- 03:34.280* :  on hold in terms of economic activity. The Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky is quoted in
*03:34.280- 03:39.240* :  the Washington Post as saying Ukraine will have to retreat in small steps if it doesn't get
*03:39.240- 03:45.020* :  more U.S. support. The Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sakorsky says he went to the U.S. recently
*03:45.020- 03:50.120* :  to try to persuade Republicans in Congress to lift their block on approving more funding.
*03:50.120- 03:55.400* :  He said it would provide much needed weapons. I was trying to persuade the American public
*03:55.400- 03:59.740* :  and the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives that the cost of
*04:00.320- 04:06.960* :  deterring Putin after he conquers Ukraine will be much higher because he would do to Ukraine what
*04:06.960- 04:13.820* :  he's done to Donbas, which is to take the resources both industrial and human and use them against us.
*04:14.300- 04:19.640* :  So it's better to help Ukraine now. So who is Donald Tusk talking to when he says Europe is now
*04:19.640- 04:25.780* :  on a pre-war footing? I asked our security correspondent Frank Gardner. Well he's talking to Weston
*04:25.780- 04:31.860* :  European NATO leaders. It's not the first time here and others in Eastern Europe have sounded the
*04:31.860- 04:37.820* :  alarm and it's getting ever more clarion I think because they are the ones closest to Russia.
*04:37.820- 04:42.060* :  They are deeply alarmed by what's going on in Ukraine by the fact that Russian
*04:42.060- 04:48.340* :  ground forces are making steady but slow progress on the ground pushing back Ukraine's forces
*04:49.160- 04:53.940* :  and they are appealing to Western NATO members particularly people like Spain for example.
*04:53.940- 05:00.880* :  They're not spending the 2% mandated of GDP per capita on defense saying if you don't spend it now
*05:00.940- 05:07.600* :  it's going to be a great deal more expensive to try and confront and defend against a newly
*05:07.600- 05:12.620* :  reinvigorated Russian army if they manage to conquer the whole of Ukraine. We've seen a lot more
*05:12.620- 05:18.840* :  energy infrastructure damaged in the last few hours. It is what we're seeing playing out now
*05:19.380- 05:23.300* :  Russia winning in the way that everyone expected at the very start of this conflict.
*05:23.700- 05:29.560* :  Not quite because I think even Western military experts thought
*05:29.560- 05:33.920* :  Kiev is not going to be able to hold out that it could just be days before it falls.
*05:33.920- 05:41.020* :  There were two big surprises. One is the resilience of the Ukrainians as to how hard and well
*05:41.020- 05:48.640* :  they fought back in those early days in 2022 and secondly the surprising unanimity amongst Western
*05:48.640- 05:54.560* :  NATO partners in coming together and giving Ukraine a lot of the help that it needed and now Ukraine
*05:54.560- 06:00.700* :  is pushed back onto the defensive as Russian forces are pushing slowly westwards.
*06:00.700- 06:07.920* :  The one area where Ukraine is doing well is in the maritime domain in the Black Sea where it's
*06:08.120- 06:15.880* :  long-range uncrewed vessels like drones underwater and above the water are wreaking havoc amongst
*06:15.880- 06:20.780* :  Russia's navy but that isn't changing the fact that the Russian Air Force is bombarding
*06:20.780- 06:27.400* :  Ukraine's cities, its defenses, its power structure, its villages, its people and on the ground
*06:27.400- 06:31.360* :  Ukraine's forces are losing territory. It's a pretty depressing picture.
*06:31.780- 06:37.500* :  And if Donald Tusk's audience are other Western leaders, what does he want them to do?
*06:37.500- 06:41.320* :  I mean he wants them to maintain focus and spending on defense.
*06:42.000- 06:46.320* :  Really what Donald Tusk is saying is echoing the warnings by other East European nations,
*06:46.320- 06:52.820* :  the ones that are closest to Russia, which is that you need to radically upgrade how much you
*06:52.820- 06:57.560* :  spend on defense. He's appealing to them to open up what's left of their armories,
*06:57.980- 07:03.140* :  rush this stuff through in support of what Ukraine's own leaders are saying. The problem is that
*07:03.620- 07:09.900* :  so far away from the front line as we are here in places like London, Paris and of course in
*07:09.900- 07:16.440* :  Washington and Ottawa it all feels a very long way away and we've got many other pressing priorities
*07:16.440- 07:21.020* :  cost of living. Take priority most people's minds and governments they haven't got a lot of money
*07:21.020- 07:27.080* :  to to spare on this they've already spent billions on helping to defend Ukraine. It didn't do
*07:27.080- 07:33.060* :  the job and I think there is a feeling in some quarters well maybe it's a lost cause maybe we
*07:33.060- 07:39.360* :  just need to settle for some kind of a bargain, some kind of a pact to stop the war and hope that
*07:39.360- 07:44.800* :  the problem all goes away. East European nations including Poland are saying that is delusional
*07:44.800- 07:51.820* :  because a pact with Putin isn't worth the paper it's written on. He will simply go away, reconstitute
*07:51.820- 07:57.740* :  his army and come back and take the rest of Ukraine or worse at a future date. Our security correspondent
*07:57.740- 08:03.800* :  Frank Gardner, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to send a team to a new round of
*08:03.800- 08:09.720* :  guards a ceasefire talks taking place in Doha and Cairo. He was speaking hours after separate
*08:09.720- 08:15.780* :  Israeli air raids in Lebanon and Syria killed two Hezbollah leaders. Here's David Bamford.
*08:16.280- 08:21.820* :  Israel's Defence Minister, you have galant warned that Israel will strike at Hezbollah anywhere
*08:21.820- 08:28.520* :  and everywhere in Beirut, Damascus and in more distant places. Hours earlier, the Israeli
*08:28.520- 08:34.500* :  military said it had killed the deputy commander of Hezbollah's rocket unit and seven others east
*08:34.500- 08:40.240* :  of Tyre in southern Lebanon. Earlier, Hezbollah said its senior commander Ahmad Shahimi was among
*08:40.240- 08:47.040* :  six fighters killed in an attack near Aleppo airport in Syria. 36 Syrian soldiers were also killed,
*08:47.040- 08:52.880* :  the highest number in a single recent raid. Russia and Iran described the attack on Syria as a
*08:52.880- 08:58.920* :  violation of international law. In Jerusalem, there's been an uneasy calm as Palestinians marked
*08:58.920- 09:04.840* :  Good Friday and Ramadan. Our international editor Jeremy Bowen is there. The Good Friday
*09:04.840- 09:10.940* :  procession along the Adolorozo where Christians believe Jesus carried his cross to his crucifixion
*09:11.360- 09:16.180* :  was smaller than usual without the foreign pilgrims who cancelled their trips because of the war.
*09:16.900- 09:23.400* :  It's also Ramadan for Muslims and next month pass over for Jews. In Jerusalem, religion is
*09:23.400- 09:30.620* :  inextricably linked with power, identity and nationhood this year sharpened by the war in Gaza.
*09:31.520- 09:36.040* :  In the procession was a Palestinian Christian activist Rafiqatahs.
*09:36.440- 09:39.680* :  All the Palestinian people are suffering today. They're suffering from occupation,
*09:39.820- 09:44.040* :  they're suffering from apartheid, they're suffering from genocide and today what we are praying
*09:44.820- 09:50.200* :  is to stop these disasters situation here in the land of peace in the land of Palestine.
*09:50.200- 09:55.180* :  So we are praying to have our own resurrection today and the resurrection of our land.
*09:55.600- 10:00.860* :  Palestine. Well the procession is entered the Holy Sepulchre Church which Christians believe
*10:00.860- 10:07.500* :  was the site of the crucifixion of Jesus as ever in this church. It's pretty chaotic.
*10:07.500- 10:12.080* :  A lot of pushing and shoving but also a strong sense of spirituality because
*10:13.340- 10:15.780* :  Jerusalem is a city of true believers.
*10:18.380- 10:23.880* :  The people of Jerusalem of all faiths are locked in a crisis as bad as any since
*10:23.880- 10:31.780* :  Israel's independence war in 1948. Religion offers certainty and answers but in this holy city
*10:32.440- 10:37.640* :  prayers and peace plans have not put a dent in this immutable conflict.
*10:39.420- 10:44.660* :  Counterterrorism police in London are investigating the stabbing of a Persian language TV presenter
*10:44.940- 10:49.740* :  Poria Zerati works for Iran International and News Channel which is critical of the Iranian
*10:50.500- 10:55.120* :  authorities. He was stabbed in the leg outside his home. According to the TV station,
*10:55.200- 10:59.720* :  police had previously warned of credible threats to the lives of two other presenters and their
*10:59.720- 11:04.620* :  families. My colleague Julian Marshall spoke to the BBC's Kasra Nudgey and asked him for more
*11:04.620- 11:09.780* :  on the TV presenter and the news channel he worked on. It's a very high profile presenter of
*11:09.780- 11:15.700* :  Iranian International and as you said, Iranian International is broadcasting in Persian to Iran
*11:16.300- 11:22.920* :  very critical of the Iranian authorities like a opposition, really opposition channel to Iran
*11:23.540- 11:30.620* :  and therefore the suspicion falls on the Iranian government, the agents of the Iranian government
*11:31.540- 11:37.220* :  that might be behind this. But let me tell you what the police are saying, the met police
*11:37.220- 11:44.200* :  spokesman saying that while we are keeping an open mind given the occupation of the victim
*11:44.200- 11:50.360* :  and our publicized concerns about the threat to the employees of that organization, he means
*11:50.360- 11:58.080* :  Iran International, the investigation is being led by the counterterrorism command. The spokesman
*11:58.080- 12:05.840* :  goes on to say, I must stress at this early stage of our investigation, we don't know the reason
*12:05.840- 12:13.240* :  why the victim was attacked and there could be a number of explanations for this. He goes on to say,
*12:13.240- 12:21.520* :  I appreciate why they concern this incident may cause particularly amongst others in similar
*12:21.520- 12:28.480* :  lines of work and those from Iranian communities. Of course, the police are saying that they are
*12:28.480- 12:36.480* :  appealing for any more information on this. And what word on the condition of the presenter?
*12:37.320- 12:45.120* :  Iranian International says that he is in a stable condition in hospital and the police are saying
*12:45.120- 12:51.900* :  that his injuries are not life-threatening. From what I understand, I spoke to some sources
*12:52.600- 12:58.180* :  in the Iran International and they say that he was established in the leg and in the foot
*12:58.660- 13:05.960* :  several times. And it seems that whoever did this, maybe they did not intend to kill.
*13:06.820- 13:11.800* :  I'm very briefly, Qasera. I mean, Britain is certainly of the view that there are Iranian officials
*13:12.380- 13:18.340* :  who are part of international criminal gangs linked to Iran, who are involved in threats to kill
*13:18.340- 13:23.760* :  journalists on British soil. That's right. In fact, last month we had the British government
*13:23.760- 13:31.060* :  imposing sanctions on Iranian officials and others. It said we're part of an international criminal
*13:31.060- 13:37.840* :  gang linked to Iran, who were involved in threats to kill journalists on British soil. Don't
*13:37.840- 13:44.880* :  forget that two other presenters of Iran International previously had received death threats,
*13:44.880- 13:50.420* :  serious death threats. And the colleague of mine in the BBC Persian has also received
*13:50.420- 13:56.100* :  serious threats. Qasera Najee from BBC Persian. Relatives of an eight-year-old girl,
*13:56.100- 14:01.380* :  murdered in southern Mexico, have joined residents of the town of Taksko to protest against the police
*14:01.380- 14:06.940* :  and demand justice for the victim. The case has caused outrage in Mexico, which has one of the
*14:06.940- 14:12.280* :  world's highest rates of violence against women. Here's our America's regional editor, Leonardo
*14:12.280- 14:17.840* :  Russia. Camila Gomez disappeared on Wednesday after entering a neighbor's house in the southern
*14:17.840- 14:23.680* :  Mexican town of Taksko to use a swimming pool. Her mother went to the police a few hours later
*14:23.680- 14:29.120* :  after receiving phone messages demanding a ransom to free her. She says she gave the police
*14:29.120- 14:33.940* :  images from the security camera for another neighbor showing the house where the girl was.
*14:34.300- 14:39.560* :  But ignored her police to act. Camila's body was found on a local road on Thursday.
*14:39.560- 14:44.560* :  Residents then attacked the three suspect killers, a woman who died in hospital,
*14:44.560- 14:50.620* :  and two men who survived the beating. The town's good Friday religious procession was called off.
*14:51.060- 14:55.840* :  The South African government has come up with a novel strategy to protect its wildlife. It
*14:55.840- 15:00.300* :  wants people to eat more of the animals. The Ministry of Environment aims to increase its
*15:00.300- 15:06.560* :  game meat industry sixfold by the year 2036. Here's our Africa Regional Editor, Richard Hamilton.
*15:07.300- 15:11.960* :  In an interview with the BBC, South Africa's Environment Minister, Barbara Kreese,
*15:11.960- 15:18.740* :  said there are vast tracks of marginal land on the outskirts of national parks that could be used
*15:18.740- 15:25.600* :  for game-ratching for animals such as antelope, buffalo and zebra. She said the plan would increase
*15:25.600- 15:31.920* :  the value of the meat, help preserve the animal's habitat, and bring much-needed revenue to poor
*15:31.920- 15:39.180* :  communities. Just as some countries are experimenting with the legalisation of drugs, she also believes
*15:39.180- 15:46.200* :  that legalising game hunting will help combat poaching. What we think is that there needs to be
*15:46.200- 15:52.680* :  a legal trade, not an illegal trade, because obviously if you have a legal trade,
*15:53.120- 15:58.060* :  you're ensuring that communities can benefit, and you're also making sure that it's
*15:58.140- 16:03.800* :  conducted in a manner that is scientifically sustainable from a conservation point of view.
*16:04.400- 16:09.840* :  It's not a situation when he's saying that anybody can come along and take a part shot.
*16:10.480- 16:16.460* :  The landowners themselves would be determining inconsultation with scientific authorities
*16:16.460- 16:21.840* :  for sustainable off-take. Barbara Kreese says it's also an opportunity to boost
*16:21.840- 16:28.820* :  black ownership of wildlife areas. Three decades since the end of a part-ate, only three and a half
*16:28.820- 16:35.960* :  percent of such land is owned by historically disadvantaged South Africans. In a nation that's
*16:35.960- 16:42.680* :  devoted to its barbecues or brides, game meat could also provide a more carbon-friendly alternative
*16:42.680- 16:50.920* :  to beef, as antelope, buffalo and zebra generate less methane than cows. They also don't require
*16:50.920- 16:58.160* :  clearing forest land that serves as a natural carbon sink. Oh, and although you might not imagine
*16:58.160- 17:05.600* :  munching a zebra burger any time soon, this leaner meat is actually healthier for your body too.
*17:06.160- 17:07.260* :  Richard Hamilton reporting.
*17:09.960- 17:10.760* :  And still to come.
*17:11.120- 17:15.580* :  Miss Hayday, life was the single most popular magazine in America,
*17:15.580- 17:19.300* :  at what generations of Americans how to look at photographs.
*17:19.740- 17:24.960* :  Life magazine, a 20th century mainstay famous for its photojournalism, is to be revived.
*17:31.160- 17:32.940* :  What are used as a weapon of war?
*17:33.160- 17:37.720* :  In none of these villages, there was any piped clean water for people.
*17:37.900- 17:39.960* :  A nation in the grip of criminal gangs.
*17:40.320- 17:44.300* :  How bad does it have to get before the international community reacts?
*17:44.700- 17:46.720* :  A country showing signs of fracture.
*17:46.940- 17:52.200* :  Right now it's done. Things are really quite dark. The nation is divided. The mistrusts
*17:52.360- 17:53.200* :  transor deep.
*17:53.500- 17:57.480* :  The global jigsaw from the BBC World Service is back for a new series.
*17:58.100- 18:02.600* :  Listen now by searching for the explanation, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:06.800- 18:08.580* :  A lot can happen in the next three years.
*18:08.840- 18:11.020* :  Like a chatbot, maybe your new best friend.
*18:11.480- 18:12.360* :  But what won't change?
*18:12.720- 18:13.580* :  Meeting health insurance.
*18:13.620- 18:17.320* :  United healthcare tried to our medical plans are available for these changing times.
*18:17.920- 18:19.560* :  Underwritten by Golden Roll Insurance Company,
*18:19.560- 18:24.300* :  they offer budget-friendly flexible coverage for people who are in between jobs or missed open

*19:11.680- 19:13.680* :  And welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*19:13.680- 19:18.600* :  The always fibrile world of politics in Northern Ireland has been rocked
*19:18.600- 19:23.460* :  with the news that the leader of the main Protestant pro-Britain party has been charged with rape
*19:23.460- 19:25.680* :  and other historical sexual offences.
*19:26.220- 19:30.100* :  Jeffrey Donaldson has now stepped down as the leader of the Democratic Unionists.
*19:30.320- 19:31.500* :  He denies the charges.
*19:32.080- 19:34.180* :  An unnamed woman has also been arrested.
*19:34.780- 19:38.300* :  Strict British laws in cases involving allegations of sex crime
*19:38.300- 19:40.560* :  has mean most details can't be reported.
*19:41.120- 19:44.860* :  So Jeffrey's sudden resignation comes weeks after he steered the DUP
*19:45.260- 19:47.840* :  back into a power sharing government with Sinn Fein,
*19:48.140- 19:51.640* :  ending a two-year boycott of Northern Ireland's devolved institutions.
*19:52.400- 19:55.460* :  Our Ireland correspondent Sarah Giffin reports from Belfast.
*19:55.460- 19:59.300* :  The police service of Northern Ireland said a 61-year-old man
*19:59.300- 20:02.520* :  had been charged with non-recent sexual offences.
*20:03.020- 20:06.220* :  A 57-year-old woman was arrested at the same time
*20:06.220- 20:09.280* :  and charged with eating and abetting additional offences.
*20:09.920- 20:13.180* :  As the Atman said, the pair are due to a peer-encourt next month.
*20:13.980- 20:16.320* :  R's leader, the Democratic Unionist party,
*20:16.320- 20:20.660* :  said Sir Jeffrey Donaldson would be stepping down as leader with immediate effect
*20:20.660- 20:25.140* :  after confirming he'd been charged with allegations of unhistorical nature.
*20:25.800- 20:29.160* :  BBC News understands Sir Jeffrey has been charged with rape
*20:29.560- 20:32.900* :  and other sexual offences after two women came forward.
*20:33.420- 20:37.120* :  The DUP said he's also been suspended as a member of the party
*20:37.580- 20:39.740* :  pending the outcome of a judicial process.
*20:39.820- 20:44.120* :  It's thought a police investigation began a number of months ago.
*20:44.140- 20:49.860* :  The East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson has been named as the DUP's interim leader.
*20:50.140- 20:51.640* :  Things have been a devastating revelation
*20:51.660- 20:56.520* :  and has caused tremendous shock, not just for myself personally or my colleagues
*20:56.520- 21:00.900* :  within the DUP, but for the community right across Northern Ireland.
*21:00.900- 21:06.080* :  It came as a great shock, but we are a party and individuals that believe in justice.
*21:06.100- 21:09.760* :  We have faith in our criminal justice system.
*21:10.000- 21:13.560* :  The former Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith told the BBC
*21:13.560- 21:17.240* :  he didn't believe the news would affect Northern Ireland's devolved government,
*21:17.240- 21:21.180* :  which returned earlier this year after a two-year hiatus.
*21:21.780- 21:25.780* :  With the election of Gavin Robinson as interim leader,
*21:25.940- 21:30.260* :  I'm not concerned in any way that this shocking news today will lead to any change
*21:30.260- 21:32.860* :  in the momentum behind power sharing.
*21:33.160- 21:35.920* :  Sir Jeffrey's resignation letter to the DUP
*21:36.480- 21:40.000* :  states he will be strenuously contesting the charges against him.
*21:40.640- 21:45.900* :  The COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and problems with global shipping routes
*21:46.260- 21:49.960* :  have all led firms to source products closer to home or as it's called
*21:50.440- 21:52.240* :  reshore their supply chains.
*21:52.240- 21:56.780* :  But the director of the World Trade Organization in Gosio-Konjo-Iwala
*21:57.200- 21:59.000* :  says that could threaten global growth.
*21:59.400- 22:03.940* :  Dr. Akonjo-Iwala told my colleague Will Bain that current WTO-free trade
*22:03.940- 22:06.360* :  rules had lifted many people out of poverty.
*22:07.040- 22:08.420* :  We are where we are today.
*22:08.840- 22:13.360* :  You know, poverty from the 1980s when we had the percentage of people living
*22:13.360- 22:17.500* :  on the absolute poverty at about 55, we are down to 10 percent today.
*22:17.740- 22:21.560* :  That is living below $2.15 a day using World Bank figures.
*22:22.100- 22:25.240* :  We are about 10 percent today, 2022 figures.
*22:25.780- 22:31.860* :  And a lot of that progress has been due to trade and the free fare and open trading system
*22:31.860- 22:32.820* :  that was created.
*22:33.380- 22:38.480* :  So we mustn't forget when there are these troubles that I imagine to try and start
*22:38.480- 22:40.360* :  throwing the baby out with the bath water.
*22:40.360- 22:42.080* :  That's what we are cautioning.
*22:42.380- 22:46.620* :  So, of course, we are concerned when protectionist measures start coming in
*22:46.620- 22:49.980* :  to sound the alarm to countries that be careful, be careful.
*22:50.440- 22:54.960* :  Because, you know, creeping protectionism, large subsidies,
*22:54.960- 23:00.840* :  all these measures that may not support competition can lead to a race to the bottom.
*23:01.240- 23:03.140* :  And how do you sell that message as a leader?
*23:03.460- 23:06.160* :  There's been this worry during the pandemic.
*23:06.160- 23:10.020* :  You know, it's a sincere worry that supply chains were disrupted
*23:10.560- 23:14.980* :  and there was difficulty with getting supplies that led to a feeling of
*23:14.980- 23:18.780* :  let's reshore, let's unshore supply chains.
*23:19.180- 23:21.300* :  And some of that will inevitably happen.
*23:21.300- 23:25.400* :  But we are warning too much of that could also lead to fragmentation.
*23:25.480- 23:26.760* :  It doesn't build resilience.
*23:27.260- 23:30.700* :  Fragmented trading world means everyone loses.
*23:31.080- 23:33.800* :  And if the world fragments into two trading blocks,
*23:33.800- 23:38.640* :  it could lead to a 5 percent loss in global GDP in the longer term
*23:38.880- 23:41.620* :  for developing countries, it will be double-digit losses.
*23:41.620- 23:45.600* :  This is nothing that anyone wants to think about.
*23:45.600- 23:52.560* :  So, I also want to point out that 75 percent of world trade takes place on that WTO term.
*23:52.580- 23:56.580* :  So, when I hear people knocking the WTO, I just smile.
*23:56.580- 23:59.280* :  Because I always say it's like the air you breathe.
*23:59.580- 24:03.380* :  So, you don't treasure it until you find yourself in a room with no oxygen.
*24:03.380- 24:07.100* :  You don't treasure the WTO and the multilateral trading system.
*24:07.440- 24:10.920* :  Till you find it's not there and then it's going to be chaos.
*24:11.480- 24:16.060* :  And that was the director of the World Trade Organization in Gozio-Konjo, Iwala.
*24:16.700- 24:20.160* :  The COVID-19 pandemic officially claimed seven million lives
*24:20.160- 24:22.700* :  and cost the world economy to trillion dollars.
*24:23.300- 24:26.940* :  As it abated, almost all countries agreed the world needed to come together
*24:26.940- 24:29.620* :  to prepare for and try to prevent the next pandemic.
*24:30.200- 24:33.760* :  And for the last two years, member states of the World Health Organization
*24:33.760- 24:36.100* :  have been working on a pandemic agreement.
*24:36.140- 24:40.460* :  But with a deadline, living next month, there's still no sign of any consensus
*24:40.460- 24:44.540* :  after a ninth and supposedly final round of negotiations in Geneva.
*24:45.240- 24:48.240* :  Nina Schvalver is founder of the Public Health Think Tank Sparks
*24:48.240- 24:49.660* :  Street Advisors in New York.
*24:50.100- 24:52.840* :  James Menendez asked her what the agreement is meant to do.
*24:53.300- 24:56.720* :  The pandemic treaty is about countries' obligations to each other
*24:57.000- 25:01.620* :  before, during and after, a pandemic so that everyone everywhere is better protected next time.
*25:02.340- 25:06.760* :  They're trying to agree on everything from diversification of vaccine production
*25:06.760- 25:10.880* :  to equitable distribution of countermeasures like vaccines and drugs,
*25:11.560- 25:15.620* :  to conditionalities around R&D funding, meaning when the public pays for funding,
*25:15.620- 25:18.600* :  should those products be available at a concessional price,
*25:19.300- 25:24.220* :  access to pathogens and genetic materials, and overall principles of what's being called equity,
*25:24.560- 25:25.920* :  being fairer to everyone everywhere.
*25:26.240- 25:28.740* :  And is it a legally binding treaty?
*25:29.620- 25:31.660* :  Yes, the agreement will be a legally binding treaty,
*25:31.860- 25:35.640* :  but depending on how it's adopted, it's either an opt-in or an opt-out.
*25:35.980- 25:37.120* :  But how might it be enforced?
*25:37.120- 25:38.740* :  I mean, are there penalties involved?
*25:39.080- 25:42.340* :  For those countries that do decide to be part of it,
*25:42.340- 25:46.040* :  we're hoping that there'll be some sort of compliance mechanism built into the treaty,
*25:46.040- 25:49.060* :  so that countries are held accountable for their commitments.
*25:50.080- 25:51.460* :  So what are the sticking points?
*25:51.460- 25:53.860* :  What's holding up agreement on this?
*25:54.540- 25:57.900* :  All member states and countries seem to agree to this principle of equity,
*25:57.900- 25:59.340* :  but the devil is in the detail.
*25:59.480- 26:00.840* :  So the sticking points are,
*26:01.600- 26:05.700* :  how do we diversify vaccine manufacturing and production who pays for it?
*26:05.760- 26:07.000* :  How do we actually share pathogens?
*26:07.840- 26:13.160* :  How do we make sure that when a high-income country produces vaccines that are based on
*26:13.160- 26:15.940* :  genetic material provided by the global South,
*26:16.320- 26:19.140* :  how does the global South get access to those products?
*26:19.440- 26:21.620* :  There are a lot of details yet to be worked out.
*26:22.740- 26:23.800* :  How urgent is this?
*26:24.600- 26:26.420* :  The next pandemic could strike this afternoon.
*26:26.420- 26:27.380* :  It could strike tomorrow.
*26:27.380- 26:28.520* :  The thing is, nobody knows.
*26:28.520- 26:31.560* :  And everybody in the world has learned lessons from COVID.
*26:32.000- 26:33.440* :  So the preparation should happen now.
*26:33.920- 26:36.400* :  I mean, is it as ever about money?
*26:36.400- 26:38.460* :  Because presumably some of these things,
*26:38.460- 26:41.280* :  like surveillance and monitoring of emerging pathogens,
*26:41.280- 26:42.500* :  or if there is an outbreak,
*26:42.980- 26:44.760* :  that does cost money.
*26:44.760- 26:47.680* :  And is it poorer countries saying we need help to do it?
*26:48.920- 26:50.540* :  Low-income countries, developing countries,
*26:50.540- 26:54.260* :  have made clear that there has to be money available to support the commitments.
*26:55.000- 26:56.840* :  And that is a sticky point in the discussions.
*26:57.320- 27:02.300* :  And to what extent are the vested interests of the drug companies holding things up?
*27:03.440- 27:06.320* :  The drug companies are playing a big role in these negotiations.
*27:06.520- 27:10.620* :  And you can see that particularly in the positions of some of the high-income countries
*27:10.800- 27:13.180* :  that have significant pharmaceutical industries.
*27:13.900- 27:16.040* :  Do you think an agreement is going to be reached?
*27:16.340- 27:19.680* :  And will it be the sort of agreement that is going to be effective?
*27:19.760- 27:24.200* :  Because I've read some criticism saying in the hurry to get something on paper,
*27:24.200- 27:26.860* :  because as you say, the next pandemic could strike today,
*27:27.880- 27:30.900* :  then actually it'll end up being a bit watered down and not very effective at all.
*27:31.880- 27:34.080* :  I spent the last week watching the negotiations.
*27:34.200- 27:36.120* :  Nobody's interested in a week instrument.
*27:36.120- 27:39.960* :  And the question is the issues that still need to be negotiated.
*27:40.740- 27:44.180* :  The member states have made clear in the World Health Organization and the Director General
*27:44.180- 27:47.160* :  of the World Health Organization that they need to get there by May.
*27:47.160- 27:49.680* :  And there's really no option for a what if.
*27:50.180- 27:55.400* :  Now the legendary American magazine Life, a 20th century mainstay famous for its photography,
*27:55.400- 27:56.540* :  is to be revived.
*27:57.100- 28:01.600* :  Created in 1883 and then bought and overhauled in 1936,
*28:02.260- 28:07.980* :  Life was long, a flagship of photojournalism, publishing images captured by huge talents like Robert
*28:07.980- 28:09.840* :  Caffer and Margaret Burke White.
*28:09.840- 28:13.520* :  From movie stars to wars, Life chronicled the times for decades.
*28:14.220- 28:17.700* :  After years of decline, it went monthly and then survived online.
*28:17.700- 28:19.900* :  But now it's returning to print.
*28:19.900- 28:25.320* :  Julian Marshall spoke to Bill Shapiro, a former editor of Life and Founding Editor of Life.com.
*28:25.860- 28:30.320* :  And it's heyday, Life was the single most popular magazine in America.
*28:30.320- 28:36.700* :  It quite simply defined news and culture for Americans for decades.
*28:37.600- 28:42.580* :  And on top of that really taught generations of Americans how to look at photographs.
*28:43.980- 28:46.580* :  And you say how to look at photographs.
*28:46.860- 28:50.800* :  And those photographs were on the hull quite extraordinary, were they not?
*28:52.580- 28:59.920* :  They were, I mean, life during its heyday lasting for decades had the best photographers
*29:00.800- 29:06.960* :  in the United States and arguably throughout the world making pictures for it on a weekly basis.
*29:07.200- 29:08.120* :  And they were extraordinary.
*29:09.260- 29:13.140* :  And was it ever afraid to shock Americans?
*29:13.140- 29:16.000* :  I'm talking here about the Vietnam War.
*29:17.300- 29:23.500* :  You know, Life loved its celebrity coverage and it loved its cultural coverage.
*29:24.100- 29:28.100* :  But it liked also to show what was going on in the world.
*29:28.100- 29:35.640* :  And that meant the Vietnam War in color brought to America by photographers like Larry Burrows.
*29:36.140- 29:41.400* :  But it also meant civil rights photographs, you know, in the South during, you know,
*29:41.400- 29:45.980* :  years of racial segregation and tension in this country.
*29:46.480- 29:52.280* :  So it didn't necessarily like to shock readers, but it wasn't afraid to.
*29:53.300- 30:00.080* :  And do you think there is still an appetite for a magazine full of those kinds of graphic
*30:00.080- 30:04.860* :  photos when people can access so many images online?
*30:07.200- 30:13.760* :  Well, what I think life brought to its readers was a curated sensibility.
*30:14.640- 30:18.860* :  And yes, there are millions of pictures available online.
*30:18.860- 30:24.820* :  But they're not brought to you in the same way or from the same voice and sort of guiding
*30:24.820- 30:29.900* :  perspective. And that's what Life magazine did so well. So they would have celebrity,
*30:29.900- 30:34.960* :  maybe on the cover. But then they would have some hard-hitting stories later and human interest
*30:34.960- 30:40.420* :  and things that would make you laugh and cry and feel something. So alive it has to do with the
*30:40.420- 30:45.980* :  editorial voice and the curation. Bill Shapiro, former editor of Life magazine.
*30:46.760- 30:52.520* :  Beyoncé has released her much anticipated country album Cowboy Carter to widespread acclaim.
*30:53.000- 30:56.560* :  She describes it as a deeper dive into the history of country music.
*30:56.560- 31:01.540* :  And it's helped to highlight other black artists in the genre stereotypically seen as white.
*31:01.580- 31:07.300* :  The US-based black opera is one organisation hoping the Beyoncé effect will help other artists.
*31:07.840- 31:10.340* :  Sophie Williams caught up with its founder Holly G.
*31:16.120- 31:21.780* :  Texas Holden made Beyoncé the first black woman to reach number one in the country Billboard charts.
*31:22.480- 31:26.280* :  And now she's releasing her hotly anticipated country album.
*31:27.300- 31:32.620* :  Last week she told fans that the criticism she faced when she first entered the country genre
*31:32.620- 31:39.160* :  had forced her to challenge herself and create the album. Country is a very white-dominated genre.
*31:39.700- 31:44.000* :  And Holly G. from the black opera has been trying to change that in recent years.
*31:44.320- 31:48.620* :  I was just somebody who was a huge fan of country music and I got really frustrated not seeing
*31:48.620- 31:53.140* :  myself represented in the genre. If you look at the people that were in the music videos,
*31:53.140- 31:58.000* :  artists, the people that were hosting the TV shows, even the marketing material,
*31:58.380- 32:00.500* :  you didn't see black people represented anywhere.
*32:02.920- 32:08.920* :  Black opera is an organisation that gives black artists and fans a space promoting their work
*32:08.920- 32:15.280* :  by hosting concerts and tours. It aims to stop black people in the industry from being overlooked
*32:15.280- 32:21.680* :  and disregarded. For Holly, it's important to change the way in which country music is perceived.
*32:22.240- 32:27.140* :  There have been black people making country music since before the industry existed.
*32:27.140- 32:32.460* :  If you look back to like when the grand old opera started, a lot of those artists were learning
*32:32.460- 32:40.420* :  country music from the black people around them. It has been centered around white people,
*32:40.420- 32:47.460* :  mostly white men. And so you have this long standing history of tradition that centers around
*32:48.260- 32:54.720* :  one type of person and that inherently creates obstacles because you're constantly being told
*32:54.720- 32:58.540* :  that this is what country music looks like and if you don't fit into this mold, you can't do it
*32:58.540- 33:06.300* :  the right way. A study by Dr. Jada Watson at the University of Ottawa found that from 2002 until 2023,
*33:06.960- 33:12.640* :  96.5% of songs played on country music radio were by white artists.
*33:13.820- 33:21.260* :  Songs by women of colour averaged just 0.6% of plays. But now, many black country artists have
*33:21.260- 33:27.020* :  seen streams and plays of their music up hundreds of percent since Beyoncé released her two country
*33:27.020- 33:32.700* :  tracks. What's up? My name's Tierra Kennedy and this is my show. I'm a singer, songwriter,
*33:32.700- 33:36.320* :  living out my country music dreams right here in Nashville, Tennessee.
*33:36.320- 33:41.760* :  Musician and podcaster Tierra Kennedy says she has seen plays of her own music increase.
*33:42.220- 33:47.480* :  I've already seen the effect personally just through my music and through socials,
*33:47.480- 33:54.400* :  pasting a little cover of Texas Hold'em and 16 carriages and just saying the response from that
*33:54.700- 34:00.780* :  has been really cool. I'm grateful for her presence in country music because I feel like she's
*34:00.780- 34:05.980* :  really changed in the game for a lot of artists. So could this focus on black country artists
*34:05.980- 34:12.620* :  last beyond Beyoncé's album? I love going through the comments on my videos and seeing all of the
*34:12.620- 34:18.800* :  people that are fans of Beyoncé that haven't always listened to country music, but now because
*34:18.940- 34:24.480* :  she's doing country, they're like, okay, I need to get over on this bandwagon. I think it's not just
*34:25.000- 34:30.200* :  a moment that's happening. I think that it's going to have residual effects and I think
*34:30.200- 34:34.080* :  there are fans that are going to be sticking around for a long time. And that was Tierra Kennedy
*34:34.080- 34:40.100* :  with Sophie Williams. And that's all from us for now. There will be a new edition of Global News
