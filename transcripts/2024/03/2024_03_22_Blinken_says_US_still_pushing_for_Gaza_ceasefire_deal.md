*01:36.480- 01:46.520* :  BBC podcast. This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Janet Joliel,
*01:46.520- 01:50.780* :  and in the early hours of Friday the 22nd of March, these are our main stories.
*01:51.520- 01:56.100* :  America's top diplomat, Anthony Blinken says there's consensus between Washington and its
*01:56.100- 02:02.800* :  Arab allies on the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In a landmark lawsuit, the U.S. Department
*02:02.800- 02:10.300* :  of Justice has accused Apple of illegally monopolising the smartphone market. The RSF paramilitary
*02:10.300- 02:17.140* :  group in Sudan has rejected a deal that would have made it easier for much needed aid to reach Dar 4.
*02:17.600- 02:24.240* :  Also in this podcast, his vital signs are very stable because this is their kidney transplant.
*02:24.240- 02:28.220* :  We monitor his urine output. He's making tons of urine. He's doing very well.
*02:28.480- 02:33.740* :  We hear about a man who has received a kidney from a genetically modified pig in the first
*02:33.740- 02:44.620* :  transplant of his kind. The site of America's top diplomat, Anthony Blinken in the Middle East,
*02:44.620- 02:50.180* :  has become a familiar one in recent months. But after holding talks in Egypt with Arab leaders
*02:50.180- 02:56.340* :  in the war in Gaza, he spoke emotionally about the dire humanitarian situation in the Palestinian
*02:56.340- 03:02.680* :  territory and said there was agreement between the U.S. and Arab nations that there had to be an
*03:02.680- 03:09.360* :  immediate ceasefire. Children should not be dying of malnutrition in Gaza or anywhere else for that
*03:09.360- 03:18.040* :  matter. 100 percent of the population of Gaza is experiencing severe levels of acute food and
*03:18.040- 03:24.760* :  security. We cannot. We must not allow that to continue. The ceasefire that we're working on
*03:25.180- 03:29.440* :  would be the best, most immediate way to enable us to surge humanitarian assistance,
*03:30.020- 03:35.380* :  but it's not the only way. And as I said, we need to really surge and sustain the assistance
*03:35.940- 03:42.240* :  across land, across sea, and across air. The U.S. says it will bring a draft resolution to
*03:42.240- 03:47.240* :  the UN Security Council on Friday that ties the need for an immediate ceasefire with the release
*03:47.240- 03:53.720* :  of hostages held by Hamas. It has previously blocked similar resolutions. Our correspondent, Tom
*03:53.720- 03:58.800* :  Bateman, listened as Mr Blinken gave his comments in the Egyptian capital. And as soon as the
*03:58.800- 04:03.260* :  camera lights were switched off, he filed this report from a busy room full of journalists.
*04:04.480- 04:08.860* :  Well, this news conference has just wrapped up with Anthony Blinken and the Egyptian foreign
*04:08.860- 04:15.140* :  minister. That now concludes this part of Anthony Blinken's trip before he heads to Tel Aviv
*04:15.620- 04:20.140* :  on Friday morning. But what we heard from him here was really reiterating that language that we
*04:20.140- 04:25.880* :  now know is in this Security Council draft resolution that is to be put to the vote by the U.S.
*04:25.880- 04:31.720* :  He talks about the need for an immediate ceasefire linked to the release of hostages.
*04:32.200- 04:37.640* :  So this is the key point about what the Americans are talking about now is that they want to get
*04:37.640- 04:43.160* :  that vote through. But it really just endorses the process that has been going on in Doha
*04:43.160- 04:48.920* :  to try and get a ceasefire and the release of hostages. That indirect negotiation between
*04:48.920- 04:55.400* :  Israel and Hamas in Qatar, currently no signs of a breakthrough with that. And another notable
*04:55.400- 05:01.340* :  moment in this news conference from the Egyptian foreign minister when he really gave Anthony Blinken
*05:01.340- 05:06.860* :  a ticking off. He talked about the double standards of the international community. I think
*05:06.860- 05:12.660* :  notably meaning the U.S. in terms of the international rules-based system. He said it suggested it
*05:12.660- 05:18.700* :  was being undermined that there was a moral imperative to hold to the international rules of
*05:18.700- 05:23.560* :  conflict everywhere in the world. And in this case, he was implying clearly it wasn't B.
*05:23.560- 05:29.160* :  It wasn't. And this is something that the West was helping to perpetrate. So that was quite a
*05:29.160- 05:34.320* :  significant moment I thought in this news conference. So from here, Anthony Blinken heads to
*05:34.320- 05:39.800* :  Tel Aviv Friday morning. And it's going to be I think a moment of the Americans putting pressure
*05:39.800- 05:45.300* :  on the Israelis over those key issues flooding more aid into Gaza amid the humanitarian crisis.
*05:45.920- 05:53.100* :  And also about their objection to a full-scale ground assault in the city of Raffa. So a
*05:53.100- 05:58.000* :  relationship that is often described as iron clad, I think we're going to see a moment of more
*05:58.000- 06:05.500* :  stress points emerging on Friday. Tom Bateman in the Egyptian capital Cairo. Well more than
*06:05.500- 06:11.800* :  five months of war in the densely populated Gaza strip have led to severe food shortages
*06:11.800- 06:17.860* :  and starvation. The U.S. has repeatedly called in Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into
*06:17.860- 06:23.400* :  the territory, but has also carried out airdrops. The head of the world health organization said only
*06:23.400- 06:29.260* :  opening more border crossings for trucks carrying aid could prevent famine in the territory.
*06:30.420- 06:34.940* :  Meanwhile, fighting has been continuing around our sheifer hospital in Gaza City,
*06:34.940- 06:41.100* :  which is crowded with patients and people who have been displaced. Al-Arab al-Qas, who's trapped
*06:41.100- 06:46.120* :  in the hospital complex, spoke to the BBC about what happened when the Israeli soldiers
*06:46.120- 06:55.140* :  searched the building. I swear by God, they just take those who they consider to be saboteurs
*06:55.140- 07:00.660* :  of the Hamas movement. It's been two days without any water, food or electricity,
*07:00.700- 07:06.560* :  and people are on top of each other in complete darkness in the corridors. There are thousands
*07:06.600- 07:13.220* :  of displaced people. We are starved and dehydrated and living in fear and terror. There were tanks
*07:13.220- 07:18.780* :  and soldiers all around us and they were firing above and around us to frighten the elderly
*07:18.780- 07:24.600* :  and the children. Israel says its raid on the hospital over the past few days has killed more than
*07:24.600- 07:32.400* :  140 fighters. News agencies have shown pitches with streams of people fleeing south from the hospital
*07:32.400- 07:39.380* :  along Gaza's coast. At the same time, the BBC has confirmed that a spokesman for Israel's
*07:39.380- 07:44.800* :  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been suspended because of a dispute with the British
*07:44.800- 07:51.860* :  Foreign Secretary David Cameron. Alon Levy has been a leading Israeli government voice since the
*07:51.860- 07:56.560* :  conflict with Hamas erupted. From Jerusalem, Mark Lohan sent this report.
*07:57.140- 08:03.580* :  Educated at Oxford, 33-year-old Alon Levy became a face of Israel's public diplomacy in English
*08:04.040- 08:08.860* :  following the Hamas attack of the 7th of October. His style, seen by some as pugnacious,
*08:08.860- 08:14.300* :  others as rude, made him a prominent attack dog in the media. But he recently turned his
*08:14.300- 08:19.080* :  sights on the Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who had posted a statement calling for Israel to
*08:19.080- 08:23.420* :  allow more aid into Gaza, adding that Britain hadn't seen an improvement on the ground.
*08:23.420- 08:29.740* :  Mr Levy shot back, calling it factually incorrect, claiming aid trucks had doubled since before
*08:29.740- 08:35.560* :  the war, and that Israel had gone further than any country in history to facilitate delivery to
*08:35.560- 08:40.200* :  enemy territory. The BBC has now confirmed that the British Foreign Office expressed
*08:40.200- 08:45.960* :  surprise to the Israeli Foreign Ministry diplomacy for annoyance, and asked whether he reflected
*08:45.960- 08:51.580* :  official policy. Mr Levy was swiftly suspended. It's thought he was already in the bad books
*08:51.580- 08:56.880* :  of Sara Netanyahu, the Prime Minister's wife, for attending anti-government marches before the
*08:56.880- 09:02.060* :  October attack. Amidst growing international exasperation with Israel over the offensive in Gaza,
*09:02.520- 09:07.100* :  it seems the Israeli government decided a punchy messenger wasn't helping.
*09:08.300- 09:15.320* :  Mark Lohan, the US is accusing the tech giant Apple of monopolizing the smartphone market in
*09:15.320- 09:20.020* :  a landmark lawsuit against the company. At a news conference, the US Attorney General,
*09:20.020- 09:25.720* :  Merrick Garland, said Apple was using its market dominance to hurt rivals, developers, and
*09:25.720- 09:32.340* :  customers. We alleged that Apple has employed a strategy that relies on exclusionary anti-competitive
*09:32.340- 09:39.220* :  conduct that hurts both consumers and developers. For consumers, that has meant fewer choices,
*09:39.860- 09:46.640* :  higher prices and fees, lower quality smartphones, apps and accessories, and less innovation from
*09:46.640- 09:52.640* :  Apple and its competitors. For developers, that has meant being forced to play by rules that
*09:52.640- 10:00.180* :  insulate Apple from competition. And as outlined in our complaint, we alleged that Apple has consolidated
*10:00.180- 10:06.640* :  its monopoly power, not by making its own products better, but by making other products worse.
*10:07.860- 10:13.100* :  Apple said the case was wrong on the facts and the law and that it would vigorously defend itself.
*10:13.720- 10:19.020* :  The tech company has also faced legal action from regulators elsewhere, including in the European
*10:19.020- 10:24.440* :  Union, Japan and South Korea. Rahul Tandon spoke to our New York business correspondent,
*10:24.440- 10:30.080* :  Michelle Flurry, and asked her, is the Biden administration really taking on big tech?
*10:30.560- 10:36.600* :  I think it's reminiscent to the case against Microsoft back in the 90s. It's going to take a long
*10:36.600- 10:42.040* :  time before we see any resolution of this. It is also not the first time that the Department of
*10:42.040- 10:47.080* :  Justice has crossed hairs with Apple. I think it's the third time. They've kind of been sued for
*10:47.080- 10:53.120* :  an illegal monopoly over the past 14 years. But this is the key product. We're talking about an
*10:53.120- 11:00.480* :  illegal monopoly over smartphones. This is the main moneymaker for Apple for a very long time.
*11:00.480- 11:06.340* :  They are accused of stifling competition. They're accused of blocking super apps of suppressing
*11:06.340- 11:13.000* :  mobile cloud streaming. They're accused of limiting how well third party smartwatches work across
*11:13.000- 11:19.480* :  its platform. So it is going to have a widespread impact on this company and it is going to be one
*11:19.480- 11:23.520* :  that Apple is going to fight tooth and nail. It is interesting, isn't it? Because it was earlier
*11:23.520- 11:30.780* :  this month that we had the EU finding Apple over 1.8 billion euros because of app store restrictions.
*11:30.780- 11:37.340* :  We've seen this action in the EU. Now we have this case in the US. Is it a coordinated attempt
*11:37.340- 11:43.140* :  by the authorities to tackle the likes of Apple? I think what we're seeing is increasing scrutiny
*11:43.140- 11:49.180* :  of giant tech companies. Not just Apple. We're seeing it also with Google and others. It just all seems
*11:49.180- 11:54.400* :  to be kind of coming to a head at the same moment. Don't forget you've got Apple also is engaged
*11:54.400- 12:01.380* :  in another kind of war of words with the maker of the Fortnite game. Again, overexcessive fees
*12:01.380- 12:06.020* :  that the game maker says Apple charges them. That is something that's been working its way through
*12:06.020- 12:11.900* :  the case aside from, as you mentioned, these other antitrust cases both in Europe but also here
*12:11.900- 12:19.980* :  in the United States. The question is, you know, what happens next? Will this detract Apple from kind
*12:19.980- 12:25.460* :  of, you know, it sort of day-to-day focus if you look at sort of what went on with Microsoft this
*12:25.460- 12:32.640* :  lasted for years? So it'll be interesting to watch how this plays out. But again, they've made the
*12:32.660- 12:37.500* :  point that things like the Apple Watch works better with an iPhone than other brands. And it's
*12:37.500- 12:42.980* :  all about how Apple locks out competitors. For its part, Apple obviously is pushing back vigorously
*12:43.340- 12:48.220* :  saying that, you know, this will harm their business going forward and their ability to kind of make
*12:48.220- 12:55.780* :  products that consumers love. Michelle Flurry, a 62-year-old man in Boston in the US has received a
*12:55.780- 13:02.760* :  kidney from a genetically engineered pig in the first transplant of its kind. Surgeons that
*13:02.760- 13:08.060* :  Massachusetts General Hospital say of such procedures are carried out on a large-scale
*13:08.680- 13:13.600* :  dialysis, which is used to treat kidney failure, could become obsolete. In the past,
*13:13.600- 13:19.740* :  pig kidneys have been put into brain-dead people as a test. Richard Slaiman, who's previously
*13:19.740- 13:26.120* :  transplanted human kidney, began to fail last year, is recovering well after the four-hour surgery
*13:26.120- 13:34.740* :  last week. Every day in the US, 17 people die waiting for a kidney transplant. Rebecca Kespy
*13:34.740- 13:40.140* :  spoke to Dr. Winfred Williams, who was on a surgical team that performed Mr. Slaiman's operation.
*13:40.980- 13:48.140* :  So how is the patient? I just left his bedside and he's doing spectacularly well. He is up and
*13:48.140- 13:54.380* :  about. He's actually has a visitor there. His cousin is visiting him as we speak, and he's in
*13:54.380- 14:00.040* :  very good spirits. We've been, of course, monitoring him very closely. His vital signs are very stable.
*14:00.040- 14:05.600* :  He's making, because this is a kidney transplant, we monitor his urine output. He's making tons of
*14:05.600- 14:11.960* :  urine. He's doing very well. Goodness me, and this is just a few days after surgery. Yes, well,
*14:11.960- 14:17.440* :  you know, on that score, in fact, when we were in the OR, at the end of the four-hour surgery,
*14:17.440- 14:25.180* :  when the vessels were unclamped and the kidney was profused on the table, when the urine was held
*14:25.180- 14:30.840* :  up, he was immediately making urine. It was really astounding. It's been a long road for this
*14:30.840- 14:37.540* :  particular patient. I just want to get to the science of using a genetically modified pig
*14:38.220- 14:44.300* :  to do this complete transplant of an entire organ. Just first of all, why was it so important
*14:44.300- 14:48.860* :  for the pig to be genetically modified? Because this is crucial as to whether or not this
*14:49.140- 14:54.640* :  is actually going to work, isn't it? Because we, as human beings, when you look at cross-species,
*14:54.640- 15:01.340* :  you know, responses to a zino allegra, this is what cross-species transplant, a zino transplant,
*15:01.920- 15:08.600* :  we have natural antibodies against pig tissue surface markers. And so the first genetic
*15:08.600- 15:16.780* :  modification is to take out these natural, they're actually glycoproteins on the pig kidney
*15:16.780- 15:23.980* :  surface and in their vascular to remove them genetically, so that we don't have an immediate,
*15:24.500- 15:29.820* :  it's called hyperacute rejection episode. So the first modification is to take out
*15:29.820- 15:37.740* :  these surface antigen markers, these glycoproteins that our bodies recognize naturally as far.
*15:37.840- 15:43.260* :  Because this is the sticking point that many people may have issues with, that it could be seen,
*15:43.260- 15:50.940* :  many people might worry that there could be a genetic issue, a contamination that by introducing
*15:50.940- 15:58.980* :  animal organs to merge with humans, we may actually invent new problems that could affect not just
*15:58.980- 16:03.560* :  that particular patient. Well, that's right. I mean, I think the other part here, so there's
*16:03.680- 16:09.480* :  pre-genetic modifications here. If you look at a series of genetic modifications, so there are
*16:09.480- 16:16.820* :  a huge array of these virus gene editing that occur just to make sure that we're not transmitting
*16:16.880- 16:24.840* :  of virus unintentionally to the human recipient. So we hope that this could be a gateway into a whole
*16:24.840- 16:33.160* :  new world of medicine, which could potentially help thousands of people living on kidney dialysis.
*16:33.160- 16:38.000* :  What's the great hope with what you've done here? The great hope is that this would actually
*16:38.000- 16:44.600* :  represent a milestone that would change the very nature of how we perform kidney transplantation
*16:44.600- 16:50.120* :  worldwide. But certainly here in the United States, there are 100,000 patients on the waiting list.
*16:50.120- 16:58.060* :  We only do on the order of 20, 25,000 transplants a year. So the demand far outstrips the supply
*16:58.060- 17:04.660* :  of donor organs. This could change that entire construct. You would be virtually able,
*17:04.660- 17:09.920* :  because of this new technology, to take a kidney off the shelf if it's needed and implanted
*17:09.920- 17:15.200* :  immediately into patients who have insane renal disease. Dr. Winfred Williams.

*19:24.260- 19:29.520* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. A prominent opposition leader in India has been
*19:29.520- 19:35.600* :  arrested by the Financial Crimes Agency as a world's largest democracy is gearing up to vote
*19:35.600- 19:40.820* :  in elections which will be held in April and May. Police surrounded the home of Delhi's chief
*19:40.820- 19:45.940* :  minister, Arving Kedriwal, a leading figure in an opposition alliance which is challenging the
*19:45.940- 19:51.940* :  party of the Hindu nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi in the polls. Mr Kedriwal's supporters say
*19:51.940- 19:57.740* :  his arrest is politically motivated. Our reporter, Dilmer Mazar Pasha, spoke to us from outside
*19:57.740- 20:02.400* :  the chief minister's home in Delhi. In a very significant development, Delhi chief minister,
*20:02.900- 20:07.980* :  Arving Kedriwal was arrested by the enforcement directorate today. The rest comes in connection
*20:07.980- 20:13.260* :  with the money laundering pro-related to the exercises policy case. Prior to his arrest,
*20:13.260- 20:19.520* :  the enforcement directorate officials conducted searches at his official residence in New Delhi.
*20:19.520- 20:25.300* :  We are told by his party members and ministers of his gunman that he has been detained but there
*20:25.300- 20:32.160* :  is no official confirmation as of now from the authorities. And his supporters are saying that
*20:32.160- 20:38.660* :  this is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to sideline opponents ahead of elections
*20:38.660- 20:43.640* :  which are due to be held in a few weeks time. I am here at the residence and I have spoken to
*20:43.640- 20:49.320* :  several of his supporters. They all are saying it's but this arrest is politically motivated and
*20:49.320- 20:54.300* :  the Prime Minister is afraid of the coming general elections which are two months away from now.
*20:54.780- 21:00.100* :  In Delhi, the elections are going to happen on 25th of May. So many of his supporters are saying
*21:00.100- 21:05.960* :  that the current Prime Minister which is seen as a very strong leader and who is claiming to come
*21:05.960- 21:11.380* :  with more than two-third majority in the parliament is afraid of Arving Kedriwal and that is why he
*21:11.380- 21:16.620* :  has been arrested. But if we look at the facts of this case, things are a bit different from what
*21:16.620- 21:21.740* :  his supporters believe. The enforcement director which is the investigative agency in this case says
*21:21.740- 21:26.540* :  it has a very strong case against the chief minister and prior to the arrest of the chief
*21:26.540- 21:31.620* :  minister, several ministers of his governments are already in jail in connection to this alleged
*21:32.140- 21:36.120* :  scam. But he's not the only opposition leader to be caught up in a criminal investigation.
*21:36.220- 21:41.340* :  And opposition parties in India are saying that Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist government is
*21:41.340- 21:47.540* :  misusing government agencies for political ends to try to stop his opponents challenging him.
*21:48.960- 21:54.940* :  Yeah, that is a very common allegation by the position parties and the fact is in last two
*21:54.940- 21:59.880* :  months, I am covering the arrest of a second chief minister by enforcement directorate and it's
*21:59.880- 22:05.380* :  not a coincidence that both of them are opposition leaders. The position parties are in an alliance
*22:05.380- 22:11.380* :  against Prime Modi's party and prior to the elections, several high profile arrests have
*22:11.380- 22:16.840* :  happened. So yes, many political commentators also believed that these arrests and all these
*22:16.840- 22:21.660* :  actions by the investigative agencies against the position leaders are politically more evaded.
*22:22.680- 22:27.640* :  Dil Navaz Pasha in Delhi. Aid agencies have been warning the civil war
*22:27.640- 22:33.560* :  incident could become the world's worst hunger crisis with millions of people on the brink of famine.
*22:34.200- 22:38.940* :  So the military government has reached a deal with the UN to bring in more humanitarian aid to
*22:38.940- 22:44.560* :  Darfur, one of the regions that's seen the heaviest fighting. But despite the suffering of the huge
*22:44.560- 22:50.940* :  numbers of people who've been displaced, maimed, raped or starved, the deal has been rejected
*22:50.940- 22:57.480* :  by the paramilitary group fighting the army, the rapid support forces which controls much of Darfur.
*22:57.580- 23:03.400* :  Our senior Africa correspondent Ansoy told us more about the devastating consequences
*23:03.940- 23:09.560* :  of the war which erupted nearly a year ago. It has been called one of the world's largest
*23:09.560- 23:16.040* :  displacement crisis. So we have people displaced multiple times inside Sudan itself and then
*23:16.040- 23:20.320* :  there were those who have made it across the border into neighboring countries and the situation
*23:20.320- 23:26.220* :  is just getting worse by day. There's no end in sight to the fighting and it has disrupted people's
*23:26.220- 23:31.720* :  lives, livelihoods, the farmers have not been able to farm and therefore this hunger in the country
*23:31.720- 23:37.420* :  and the World Food Programme is warning that going into the lean season starting around May,
*23:37.420- 23:43.580* :  they could enter the highest levels of hunger which is called the catastrophic hunger.
*23:43.940- 23:48.100* :  We're talking about something like 25 million people, I think that's the figure I've seen quoted.
*23:48.620- 23:54.020* :  So there's been this deal struck between the military government and the United Nations to try
*23:54.020- 24:01.400* :  to get more humanitarian aid. So why has the rapid support forces paramilitary group which is
*24:01.400- 24:07.820* :  fighting the government rejected this deal? It's all about control. In February the
*24:08.280- 24:14.460* :  army which is the de facto government in Sudan at the moment blocked the border from Chad
*24:14.460- 24:20.360* :  in the western side of the country into Darfur. Well that's where humanitarian aid has been coming
*24:20.360- 24:26.240* :  in through in Darfur and then they blocked that border to a vast area that's controlled by the
*24:26.240- 24:31.880* :  rapid support forces because they say they've made accusations that arms are being smuggled to
*24:31.880- 24:38.860* :  the arrivals, the RSF. After negotiations they're agreed to reopen one border which is to an area
*24:38.860- 24:45.120* :  that the army controls but the vast part of Darfur is controlled by the RSF. Now there have been
*24:45.120- 24:52.980* :  talks ongoing between the different sides and the UN and yesterday it was announced that there
*24:52.980- 24:59.440* :  had been breakthrough that one more route was going to be reopened and that is from Port Sudan
*24:59.560- 25:05.220* :  which is the port city by the Red Sea via the northern state down to the western side that is
*25:05.220- 25:11.580* :  Darfur and you know these are areas which the army controls and RSF came out today to say that
*25:11.580- 25:18.320* :  they reject that agreement and they level the same accusation that has been leveled against them
*25:18.320- 25:24.860* :  that it may be used to smuggle arms to rearm the army after it had lost much of Darfur.
*25:25.940- 25:31.900* :  And so the Ukrainian President has warned you leaders they need to act quickly to send more
*25:31.900- 25:37.820* :  ammunition to Ukraine. Vladimir Zelensky speaking via video link so the amount of artillery shells
*25:37.820- 25:43.740* :  available to Ukrainian soldiers was humiliating for the whole of Europe. The German Chancellor of
*25:43.740- 25:48.580* :  left-shorts has reaffirmed his support for a plan to use the profits from hundreds of billions
*25:48.580- 25:55.440* :  of dollars of frozen Russian assets to pay for more weapons for Ukraine. Our Europe Regional
*25:55.440- 26:02.160* :  Editor Alice Adley reports. President Zelensky told the leaders of the 27 countries in the EU
*26:02.160- 26:07.960* :  that this was Russia's war not only against Ukraine but against all of their countries as well
*26:07.960- 26:13.660* :  against the whole of Europe and the European way of life. He said he was grateful for the help
*26:13.660- 26:20.160* :  that had been provided so far but called for more air defenses enough to protect his whole country
*26:20.160- 26:26.880* :  and for more artillery. Ukraine has been suffering from dwindling supplies of weapons and ammunition
*26:26.880- 26:33.080* :  while it waits for a US financial aid package which remains blocked by Republicans in Congress.
*26:33.660- 26:38.860* :  EU leaders have been discussing plans to use revenues from frozen Russian assets to support
*26:38.860- 26:44.440* :  Ukraine's military. The funds were blocked in retaliation for Russia's full-scale invasion of
*26:44.440- 26:51.100* :  Ukraine. As he arrived for the summit in Brussels the German Chancellor Olaf Shaltz said Russia
*26:51.100- 26:58.200* :  had no right to the money. This is about the earnings which no one is entitled to and therefore
*26:58.200- 27:03.800* :  can be used by the European Union and as far as I'm concerned it should first and foremost be
*27:03.800- 27:10.160* :  used to buy the ammunition Ukraine needs for its defense. Reacting to the European plans
*27:10.160- 27:16.860* :  President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that Russia would fight back with all means
*27:16.860- 27:23.020* :  necessary. Meanwhile the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is sympathetic to Moscow,
*27:23.100- 27:29.220* :  broke ranks and congratulated the Russian President Vladimir Putin on his re-election which has
*27:29.220- 27:36.260* :  been widely condemned in the West as undemocratic. Alice Adley, for people who are paralyzed it's a
*27:36.260- 27:41.680* :  source of hope that they'll be able to once again do the things they used to. The first patient
*27:41.680- 27:47.540* :  to receive a brain chip from Elon Musk's company Neurolink has been shown apparently playing
*27:47.540- 27:54.520* :  online chess. 29-year-old Nolan Arbor, who's paralyzed below the shoulders, received the chip implant
*27:54.520- 28:00.020* :  in January. So a lot of what we started out with was attempting to move so I would attempt to move
*28:00.480- 28:10.080* :  say my right hand left right forward hand from there. I think it just became intuitive for me to
*28:11.160- 28:19.580* :  start imagining the cursor moving. Basically it was like using the force on the cursor and I could
*28:19.580- 28:24.580* :  get it to move wherever I wanted, just stare somewhere in the screen and it would move where I wanted
*28:24.580- 28:29.740* :  it to. Other billionaires like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos are also investing heavily in this
*28:29.740- 28:35.480* :  technology which could one day allow paralyzed people to control devices through thought alone.
*28:36.520- 28:40.760* :  Mariska von Steinsel is a neuroscientist at the University Medical Center,
*28:40.760- 28:45.460* :  Utrecht Brain Center in the Netherlands and president of the International Brain Computer
*28:45.460- 28:51.800* :  Interface Society. She has concerns about how Neurolink is developing the technology.
*28:52.420- 28:59.060* :  People with quadriplegia, so complete paralysis from the shoulders below being able to control their
*28:59.060- 29:05.040* :  computer in an adequate fashion and thereby have autonomy in their lives and interact with others
*29:05.040- 29:10.680* :  but also just make use of a computer the way that everybody people can do. I think that's a great
*29:10.680- 29:15.580* :  benefit but this type of technology is also being developed for people who can alarm or speak
*29:16.260- 29:20.360* :  allowing them to use their brain signals to communicate. So that's yet another target population
*29:20.500- 29:26.240* :  of these kind of technologies. Of course Neurolink is not the only company that is working on new
*29:26.240- 29:31.220* :  technologies to read brain signals and to do something useful with those brain signals. There are other
*29:31.220- 29:38.080* :  companies working in this space but usually those companies collaborate with academic researchers
*29:38.080- 29:44.080* :  with medical centers in a tour on their studies and to collect research data that is then published
*29:44.140- 29:50.040* :  in peer-reviewed papers. We know very little of basically nothing about how Neurolink is handling
*29:50.040- 29:54.600* :  this. Do they collaborate with an academic research center with a medical hospital? Do they
*29:55.020- 30:00.940* :  build their own hospital? We don't know and not having publications on the data or even better
*30:01.440- 30:07.500* :  share the data will make it more difficult for the rest of the BCA community to assess the value
*30:07.500- 30:14.180* :  of the system compared to the other developments out there. Neuroscientist Murske von Stenzel.
*30:15.080- 30:20.820* :  A Holocaust survivor who went on to become a tailor for six US presidents, the singer Frank Sinatra
*30:20.820- 30:27.420* :  and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio has died at the age of 95. As a teenager Martin Greenfield was
*30:27.420- 30:33.600* :  imprisoned at the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz, he was the only member of his family to
*30:33.600- 30:40.020* :  survive the Holocaust. Molly Perilla looks back at his life. Born into a Jewish family, Martin
*30:40.020- 30:46.480* :  Greenfield was taken to Auschwitz in 1944. He was taught to sow by a fellow prisoner after he
*30:46.480- 30:52.300* :  accidentally ripped a guard shirt. He mended it and wore it under his prison uniform. Other
*30:52.300- 30:58.020* :  prisoners thought it signified that he had special privileges. Decades later Mr. Greenfield wrote
*30:58.020- 31:03.200* :  in his memoir that it was this that taught him that clothes possess power. He spoke about his
*31:03.200- 31:10.780* :  life in a 2018 documentary. When you dress people like I do, I know everything about them.
*31:11.200- 31:17.440* :  How often you wear the suit, whether you're cold or hot, it's going to wrinkle too much.
*31:17.440- 31:24.480* :  I'm a sudak, another medical bag. Mr. Greenfield was freed after about a year at the concentration
*31:24.480- 31:31.000* :  camp. With $10 in his pocket, he boarded a ship to New York. He went on to set up a very successful
*31:31.000- 31:37.720* :  business with clients, including the last three US presidents, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe
*31:37.720- 31:43.820* :  Biden. Mr. Greenfield was widely regarded as the best men's tailor in the United States. But he
*31:43.820- 31:50.860* :  never forgot the horrors of Auschwitz and what he'd lost. The pain is still in my heart about my
*31:50.860- 31:57.860* :  family. I still dream about my family. Mr. Greenfield's sons said he survived the atrocities of the
*31:57.860- 32:03.880* :  Holocaust with his humanity intact and that his infectious smile left a positive impression on
*32:03.880- 32:07.900* :  everyone he met. That report by Molly Perilla.
