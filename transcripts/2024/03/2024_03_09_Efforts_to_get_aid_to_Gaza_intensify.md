*02:05.120- 02:09.920* :  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Saturday the 9th of March. These are our main stories.
*02:09.980- 02:15.080* :  Efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza by Air and Sea have intensified,
*02:15.520- 02:20.020* :  as the UN says a quarter of the population in the Palestinian Territory is on the brink of famine.
*02:20.180- 02:24.160* :  A police officer in the Indian Capital Delhi has been suspended.
*02:24.580- 02:29.400* :  After video footage seemed to show him kicking Muslim men while they are offering Friday prayers
*02:29.400- 02:34.380* :  in the street. The UN's nuclear watchdog says its specialists have heard several
*02:35.120- 02:39.780* :  explosions near the Zapparizia power plant in Ukraine suggesting fighting with heavy weapons.
*02:42.020- 02:45.680* :  Also in this podcast, as Hollywood prepares for the Oscars on Sunday,
*02:45.680- 02:49.340* :  there's just one question preoccupying fans of the Barbie movie.
*02:49.660- 02:52.160* :  Are we going to get a Barbie too? I mean, we love to.
*02:53.460- 02:57.620* :  Yeah, we're always talking about it. I think right now we're just so happy this week to be
*02:57.620- 03:01.580* :  celebrating Barbie's success and Barbie at the Oscars this weekend.
*03:01.840- 03:04.240* :  We'll hear from one of Hollywood's most powerful women.
*03:08.940- 03:12.440* :  After warnings this week that a quarter of people in Gaza are on the brink of famine,
*03:12.860- 03:17.240* :  the US and its allies have stepped up efforts to deliver aid to Palestinian families.
*03:17.940- 03:21.840* :  On Thursday, President Biden announced that the US military will establish a temporary
*03:21.840- 03:27.340* :  port on Gaza's coast. On Friday, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen,
*03:27.560- 03:31.520* :  announced the creation of a maritime corridor to deliver aid by sea.
*03:31.520- 03:36.180* :  The Deputy Director of Operations at the UN Relief Agency, Unruh Scott Anderson,
*03:36.180- 03:39.220* :  welcome the plan. We hope it will make a significant difference.
*03:40.100- 03:44.660* :  I think that there's some details we need to work out on the logistics of the sea route.
*03:44.660- 03:48.880* :  How will it be delivered on the beach? Who will do further distribution, things like that?
*03:49.600- 03:52.740* :  But we welcome this because we know there are people starving and we need to get
*03:52.740- 03:57.480* :  them made as quickly as possible. But this man in Raffa said what Palestinians really need is an
*03:57.480- 04:01.820* :  end to the war. Instead of telling us they will build a port to
*04:01.820- 04:06.900* :  help us stop providing the weapons they throw at us. All these American weapons are killing our
*04:06.900- 04:12.040* :  kids and killing us wherever we go. We don't need aid from them. We need them to stop the killing,
*04:12.040- 04:18.340* :  stop the death. Wherever we go, we find death. So talk of a port and a maritime corridor,
*04:18.340- 04:22.680* :  but I'll leave the same thing. I'll start correspondent in Jerusalem. We're a Davis.
*04:23.400- 04:27.760* :  No, these are completely different things. They just happened to have been announced 24 hours
*04:27.760- 04:32.920* :  apart. I think to be honest, Joe Biden wanted to announce a cease-fire. That cease-fire between
*04:32.920- 04:39.600* :  Israel and Hamas didn't happen and he wanted to announce something. So they've got this plan
*04:39.760- 04:43.820* :  and it is a very far-fetched plan and we don't know how it's going to work to build a sort of
*04:43.820- 04:48.840* :  port that would bring not just aid but perhaps even building materials to help with the reconstruction
*04:48.840- 04:53.080* :  of Gaza in the future. But that's a couple of months down the line, I think. What we've heard
*04:53.080- 04:58.700* :  from the Europeans and the Emirates and others is this so-called maritime corridor.
*04:59.280- 05:05.620* :  And again, this would be a boat, initially one boat, that would try to take pre-checked aid
*05:05.620- 05:12.020* :  from Cyprus towards the coast of Gaza. And as the guy from the UN, underwear said there,
*05:12.660- 05:16.980* :  how it's going to land, how it's going to be protected, how you're going to keep a million and
*05:16.980- 05:23.220* :  a half desperately hungry garsons away from these boats as they try to offload their aid on
*05:23.220- 05:27.440* :  shore. Nobody knows because there'll certainly be no foreign troops, no American troops, no British
*05:27.440- 05:33.500* :  troops, no Emirati troops in Gaza. But both of these announcements seem to be, I don't want to
*05:33.500- 05:38.500* :  use the word far-fetched, but they're not going to help really with the amount of aid that's needed.
*05:39.040- 05:44.240* :  You know, 100 trucks a day at the minute make it into Gaza. It's nowhere near the 500, 600 trucks
*05:44.240- 05:49.820* :  that are needed and it's really opening this land border even without a cease-fire and allowing
*05:49.820- 05:54.920* :  more stuff in, more aid in from Israel that would alleviate the desperate humanitarian situation
*05:54.920- 06:00.420* :  in Gaza. Because both these efforts are also over the heads of the Israeli government. And the
*06:00.660- 06:04.980* :  Israeli government is already saying, well, don't think any aid is going to be getting along this
*06:04.980- 06:08.940* :  corridor that's been announced without security checks and things that are bound to slow it up.
*06:09.200- 06:12.460* :  Some people say it gets the Israelis off the hook because there's the occupying power,
*06:12.840- 06:19.100* :  as the invading army, they have an obligation under international laws to make sure that the people
*06:19.100- 06:24.500* :  in northern Gaza do get the adequate aid and help their need. Now, Israel says it will allow
*06:24.500- 06:30.580* :  in as much aid as it's possible. And it blames the United Nations under the agencies for being
*06:30.580- 06:35.920* :  slow with it. In turn, people like the World Food Programme say that Israel is actually turning away
*06:36.520- 06:41.500* :  certain aid consignments and therefore only about 100 trucks a day are getting through when a lot
*06:41.500- 06:47.160* :  more is actually needed. We're a Davis with me from Jerusalem. So how does Israel see itself being
*06:47.160- 06:52.980* :  involved in this new initiative of a maritime corridor with aid going from Cyprus into Gaza?
*06:53.400- 06:58.040* :  Off your fork is a foreign policy advisor to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*06:58.460- 07:03.180* :  All of the aid will be scanned and the security cleared and we'll be able to get more trucks in.
*07:03.180- 07:09.200* :  Israel has already enabled thousands of trucks, its humanitarian aid, a food, water, medical attention
*07:09.200- 07:16.460* :  or medicine. Of course, Mr. Tolkien could be argued that this maritime corridor, these US air drops
*07:16.460- 07:28.780* :  would not be necessary, had more aid being getting into Gaza by road, by road convoys. And
*07:28.780- 07:35.600* :  Israel stands accused of obstructing the flow of that aid into Gaza.
*07:36.460- 07:41.040* :  All right, so that's absolutely ridiculous, of course. A lot of the humanitarian aid would
*07:41.040- 07:46.620* :  reach the civilians if Hamas was destroyed and wouldn't be stealing humanitarian aid that
*07:46.620- 07:52.960* :  Israel hasn't able to go in. But by Israel's, but by Israel's, you asked the question.
*07:53.040- 07:56.820* :  I did ask the question, but I just wanted to break in at that particular point,
*07:57.500- 08:05.840* :  because of course Israel says it's now rid northern Gaza of Hamas. So that really isn't an
*08:05.840- 08:12.700* :  issue Hamas interfering with the distribution. Actually, actually Israel never said that we've
*08:12.700- 08:18.980* :  rid north Gaza of Hamas. There are still a number of Hamas terrorists there and we're still fighting
*08:18.980- 08:23.460* :  there. We're still taking mapping out true. There aren't brigades there. We've been able to
*08:23.460- 08:31.780* :  dismantle 18 or even almost 19 of the 24 Hamas brigades, but we haven't gotten rid of Hamas yet.
*08:32.340- 08:37.580* :  Just returning to that accusation of Israel, obstructing the delivery of aid by
*08:37.580- 08:40.800* :  I told you that's ridiculous. Well, what that's ridiculous.
*08:41.380- 08:48.400* :  President Biden says that Israel must do its part by allowing more aid to enter the territory.
*08:48.400- 08:54.100* :  That's the president of the United States or closest ally. I mean, I'll respect and appreciate
*08:54.100- 08:59.300* :  all the support that the president has provided. Israel we also appreciate his wise words on
*08:59.300- 09:06.340* :  October 18th when he said that if Hamas steals the aid or diverse the aid, that will stop immediately.
*09:06.340- 09:11.380* :  On October 18th, the president said that. Nevertheless, Israel is enabled and has been
*09:11.380- 09:16.500* :  able thousands, thousands of trucks. I don't know how many trucks you've been able, Julian,
*09:16.500- 09:21.420* :  but Israel has enabled thousands of trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza. And honestly,
*09:21.420- 09:26.660* :  we don't need anybody to prompt us to provide humanitarian aid because ethics have been our DNA.
*09:27.440- 09:31.400* :  Okay, I just did this week. The World Food Programme said it attempted to reach northern Gaza
*09:31.400- 09:38.840* :  with food supplies, but was turned back at an Israeli defense force checkpoint.
*09:39.680- 09:47.060* :  That is a specific example of the blocking of aid into Gaza by the Israeli defense forces.
*09:47.060- 09:52.580* :  Your response to that. I'm not familiar with that specific incident, but I can tell you that
*09:52.580- 09:58.380* :  Israel has enabled thousands of trucks of humanitarian aid to come in and will continue to enable that.
*09:58.800- 10:04.220* :  And we've coordinated with our American and Cyprus allies to get aid in through the maritime
*10:04.220- 10:10.500* :  routes that we've enabled. And we're trying to get thousands as much humanitarian aid as possible
*10:10.500- 10:14.600* :  after it's cleared and security has security clearance. And that's the goal.
*10:14.600- 10:23.800* :  It is reported that 16,000 trucks have entered Gaza since the beginning of this conflict or
*10:23.800- 10:32.560* :  about 105 a day, but that is far below the average of 500 commercial trucks that had entered
*10:33.220- 10:39.940* :  Gaza daily before the fighting began. Say, you're right on thousands, but it is still far
*10:39.940- 10:45.800* :  short of what is required necessary. Julian, I don't know where you get this 500 trucks
*10:45.800- 10:50.280* :  humanitarian aid from. That's not an accurate number. It certainly didn't come from Israel.
*10:50.280- 10:54.720* :  At any rate, we're at war and we're going to destroy some of us and free our hostages.
*10:55.180- 11:00.760* :  Off air fork with my colleague Julian Marshall. The Zappareja nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine
*11:00.760- 11:06.020* :  is the biggest in Europe. It's been under Russian control since the start of the war two years ago.
*11:06.500- 11:11.220* :  The UN Nuclear Watchdog, the IAEA, which has been meeting in Vienna, says it now has
*11:11.220- 11:17.020* :  serious concerns about safety there. Bethany Bell is our correspondent in Vienna. I asked Bethany
*11:17.020- 11:23.800* :  what exactly the IAEA had been saying. Well, it says the situation at the plant is very precarious.
*11:23.800- 11:30.740* :  It's got specialist stationed at Zappareja. It says that they're continuing to hear explosions
*11:30.920- 11:37.580* :  very close to the facility. There has been shelling there which has brought down power lines
*11:37.600- 11:45.420* :  and the plant has lost all external power eight times in the last 18 months, which means it's
*11:45.420- 11:52.340* :  forced them to rely on diesel generators to do crucial things like cool the fuel in its reactors
*11:53.080- 12:00.180* :  and to avoid catastrophic meltdowns. So this is really the IAEA says not the way
*12:00.180- 12:07.000* :  a nuclear power plant should be run and the Board of Governors issued a resolution saying that they
*12:07.000- 12:11.100* :  were gravely concerned about this. So there are issues here about the safety of the plant,
*12:11.100- 12:17.820* :  obviously the supply of electricity, but also this idea of fighting in that part of Ukraine now seems
*12:17.820- 12:25.520* :  to have come down of nowhere. Well, the team at Zappareja of the IAEA has said it's heard multiple
*12:25.520- 12:33.740* :  explosions in recent days and suggesting in their words that heavy weapons were being used close
*12:33.740- 12:40.860* :  to the plant. And this is something that the head of the IAEA Raphael Grossi has warned repeatedly
*12:41.580- 12:48.420* :  of the dangers posed to the plant by the ongoing conflict there. And he says that both sides have
*12:48.420- 12:54.860* :  accused each other for the shelling near that region. Mr. Grossi has said that both sides have to
*12:54.860- 13:01.540* :  help to reduce the danger of what he called a potentially severe nuclear accident because he
*13:01.540- 13:06.460* :  said that would recognize no borders. Now, they've also had talks with President Putin in Russia
*13:07.040- 13:14.460* :  this week. What came out of that? Yes, Mr. Grossi went to Sochi in Russia. He met Mr. Putin.
*13:15.040- 13:21.340* :  We haven't heard that much about the actual content of the talks, but Mr. Grossi described
*13:21.340- 13:28.760* :  them as frank and professional. He said that he told Mr. Putin that nobody stands to gain
*13:28.760- 13:34.160* :  from a nuclear disaster and that we must do everything possible to prevent it.
*13:34.740- 13:40.180* :  Bethany Bell with me from Vienna. Officials in the Indian capital Delhi have suspended a police
*13:40.180- 13:45.860* :  officer after a video went viral in which he appeared to kick Muslim men offering Friday prayers
*13:45.860- 13:50.700* :  on a road. A senior official said they'd initiate disciplinary proceedings against the policeman.
*13:51.200- 13:57.280* :  Here's Ann Barerson-Etharajan. The video triggered very angry reaction on social media with several
*13:57.280- 14:02.900* :  people, including opposition political parties demanding strict action against the Delhi police
*14:02.900- 14:08.800* :  officer. The incident prompted a protest by angry locals who blocked traffic in the interloc
*14:08.800- 14:14.800* :  area of the Indian capital. Footage on social media showed the official kicking and slapping the
*14:14.800- 14:20.500* :  men telling them to leave the area. Residents said the prayers were not causing any traffic
*14:20.500- 14:26.060* :  disruption. The latest incident came amid accusations by activists that Muslims are being
*14:26.060- 14:32.260* :  discriminated against, especially after the Hindu nationalist to BJP came to power in 2014.
*14:32.300- 14:37.720* :  The party rejects the accusation. It's Hollywood's big night tomorrow as we get to know the winners
*14:37.720- 14:44.400* :  in losers of the 96th Academy Awards. Oppenheimer needs the way, but Barbie with its age nominations
*14:44.400- 14:49.900* :  was the big winner at the box office. Warner Brothers, the company that made Barbie is writing high on
*14:49.900- 14:55.980* :  the movie's success. The co-chairman and co-CEO of the studio's motion picture group is Pam Abdi.
*14:56.320- 14:59.540* :  Our culture editor Katie Brazel went to Los Angeles to meet her.
*15:00.360- 15:05.440* :  What happened here? Warner Brothers made Barbie, the biggest grossing film of last year,
*15:05.440- 15:09.860* :  mainly in the UK. Greta Gowig wasn't nominated for a best director Oscar.
*15:10.100- 15:14.420* :  Hamago Robbie isn't up for best actress, which has got to hurt if you're Pam Abdi,
*15:14.500- 15:19.600* :  one of Hollywood's most powerful women. Yeah, of course it does. You know, of course I want
*15:19.600- 15:24.320* :  to see all of them get recognized. They deserve it. Do you think the Academy voters are sexist?
*15:25.020- 15:30.680* :  I don't want to say that they are sexist. You guys are clearly not doing patriarchy very well.
*15:30.820- 15:34.680* :  But Abdi, the co-chair and CEO of Warner Brothers motion picture group,
*15:34.680- 15:40.740* :  does worry that not enough Academy voters actually watched Barbie. The Academy has worked to
*15:40.740- 15:46.260* :  diversify its membership in recent years, but it's still a predominantly white male organization.
*15:46.400- 15:52.500* :  And we're really grateful that it ignited audiences around the world. And it's made 1.4 billion
*15:52.500- 15:58.660* :  dollars and has smashed so many records. Just, you know, Greta's records, box office records,
*15:58.660- 16:01.960* :  Warner Brothers history records. So we're super grateful for all of that.
*16:02.160- 16:08.020* :  Margot Robbie now has a key to the lot. An old Warner tradition revived by Abdi and co-chair
*16:08.020- 16:13.120* :  Michael DeLuca. Madeline Monroe is presented with a key to Warner Brothers studio by executive producer
*16:13.120- 16:20.080* :  Jack L. Warner. And he found a couple of the old keys on on eBay actually. And we bought them
*16:20.300- 16:25.100* :  and we're now going to make it a tradition. Margot is actually Marilyn Monroe's key.
*16:25.140- 16:29.780* :  There are tools. Yes. You're giving me my tool. Yes, I am. What can you tell me?
*16:29.900- 16:33.180* :  Isn't it a beautiful lot? Yeah, it's great. I love it. I love walking around the lot.
*16:33.520- 16:38.940* :  Abdi and DeLuca were hired two years ago with a mission to restore the studio to its glory days.
*16:39.440- 16:43.760* :  You're here. You've been brought in with fanfares. Like you guys are here. You're going to take
*16:43.760- 16:48.880* :  this movie studio back to its glory days. Yeah. What went wrong? I think the business
*16:49.520- 16:53.780* :  became about you have to make only franchises. It's franchise franchise and you have to make
*16:54.240- 16:57.800* :  superhero movies. And I think that's what's gone wrong with the industry.
*16:58.720- 17:04.940* :  We've got one hope. All America's industrial might and scientific innovation connected here.
*17:06.120- 17:08.160* :  But Warner Brothers created its own problems.
*17:08.840- 17:12.200* :  This year's Oscar favorite, the Oppenheimer director, Christopher Nolan,
*17:12.200- 17:18.060* :  spent most of his career at the studio. But he walked away in 2020, furious at the decision
*17:18.060- 17:23.060* :  to put movies straight onto the studio's streaming service. So did you think Warner got that wrong
*17:23.060- 17:26.740* :  when it came to Christopher Nolan? I can't judge what they were doing. I think they were trying
*17:26.740- 17:30.980* :  to adapt to whatever was going on. You know, we were in the middle of a global pandemic.
*17:30.980- 17:33.980* :  You know, I can only speak. But they lost their bigger star. Yes.
*17:34.820- 17:38.900* :  Part of the strategy is to lure in big names. They'd like Nolan back.
*17:38.900- 17:42.640* :  Tom Cruise is already signed up to make new movies with the studio.
*17:42.960- 17:47.060* :  Tom had made amazing films at Warner Brothers and he's been working at Paramount for a long time
*17:47.060- 17:50.460* :  and we want it to figure out a way. How do we do that? When you're speaking to these directors,
*17:50.460- 17:53.880* :  are you promising them, look, your film is going to be out in cinemas for us? Absolutely.
*17:53.880- 17:57.920* :  We're not going to put it straight on the streamer. Absolutely. We are a theatrical studio.
*17:58.880- 18:03.720* :  We have a track record for winning Oscars. Birdman, the big short, the revenant.
*18:04.340- 18:06.760* :  What's your recipe for Oscar glory? Directors.
*18:07.580- 18:12.760* :  Always the director. But for many, there's only one question. Are we going to get a Barbie too?
*18:13.100- 18:18.740* :  I mean, we love to. Yeah, we're always talking about it. I think right now we're just so happy
*18:18.740- 18:23.480* :  this week to be celebrating Barbie success and Barbie at the Oscars this weekend.
*18:24.040- 18:26.260* :  And that report from Katie Razzle in Los Angeles.
*18:28.620- 18:31.880* :  Still to come? Goku, you think you've got enough fire with there?
*18:34.080- 18:36.480* :  Yeah, this should last us a while. Don't you think?
*18:37.740- 18:41.580* :  The creator of one of Japan's most popular comics of all time has died.

*19:44.260- 19:49.000* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*19:49.000- 19:54.120* :  prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates
*19:54.120- 19:58.680* :  those owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about? You insane
*19:58.680- 20:03.540* :  Hollywood s**t. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month

*20:18.860- 20:23.820* :  A report into a British Army spy who operated during the troubles in Northern Ireland has said more
*20:23.820- 20:29.320* :  lives were probably lost than saved by his involvement. The agent's known as steak knife was
*20:29.320- 20:35.360* :  embedded in the Irish Republican Army, the IRA. He was Freddie Scapatici, a bricklayer from West
*20:35.360- 20:41.680* :  Belfast, who worked in an IRA unit that interrogated and tortured suspected informants. The interim
*20:41.680- 20:46.480* :  report has concluded that British security forces failed to prevent some of the killings in an
*20:46.480- 20:51.560* :  effort to shield their own agents. This might correspond in Belfast, Jennifer O'Leary.
*20:52.180- 21:00.800* :  For decades spies were the state's eyes and ears inside the IRA, a secret army that executed
*21:00.800- 21:09.660* :  informers. The IRA's chief enforcer was Freddie Scapatici, the dark twist being he was also a
*21:09.660- 21:17.340* :  prized army intelligence asset, code name steak knife. He is not identified in the report because
*21:17.340- 21:24.980* :  of the existing government and security policy of not naming agents. He always denied it but revealed
*21:24.980- 21:31.340* :  his true character to BBC journalist after his double life was exposed in 2003.
*21:40.960- 21:47.020* :  Among today's interim findings from Operation Canova, a seven-year investigation into his
*21:47.020- 21:55.240* :  activities and the role of his handlers is a brutal equation. Agent steak knife probably cost
*21:55.240- 22:02.080* :  more lives than he saved. John Boucher led the investigation before being appointed chief
*22:02.080- 22:08.280* :  constable of the police service of Northern Ireland. He said the agent should have faced justice.
*22:08.940- 22:14.260* :  And I'll say Freddie Scapatici should have been prosecuted for offenses and he was not prosecuted.
*22:14.740- 22:23.380* :  And in my view that is something that forever victims, certain victims will be regretful about.
*22:23.780- 22:30.980* :  Now dead Freddie Scapatici was a spy who got away with murder shootings that were signed off by
*22:30.980- 22:37.660* :  senior IRA leaders. Today's report called for an apology from Republican leaders for the
*22:37.660- 22:44.860* :  IRA's brutality. Northern Ireland's First Minister Michelle Neal, the first Republican to hold
*22:44.860- 22:51.140* :  that post was asked if she would apologize. I am sorry for all the lives lost during the conflict
*22:51.140- 22:58.520* :  without exception. Regrettably the past cannot be changed or cannot be undone. Neither can the
*22:58.520- 23:04.220* :  suffering, the hurt or the political balance of conflict be disowned by Republicans or indeed
*23:04.220- 23:09.720* :  by any other party to the conflict. During the troubles the fate of those accused of giving away
*23:09.720- 23:17.040* :  the IRA's secrets became a form of public spectacle. Bodies were dumped in ditches and alleyways
*23:17.700- 23:24.080* :  and grieving families left with the stain within Republican communities that they'd buried a suspected
*23:24.080- 23:32.320* :  tout. Like Shauna Moorland who was just 10 years old when her mother was shot dead, she said if
*23:32.320- 23:39.000* :  her mother was an informer, she wanted to know why the British state failed to protect her.
*23:39.400- 23:43.020* :  I think if she was in form and she had hunkers, the widow knew she was missing.
*23:43.440- 23:47.200* :  There were many more IRA informers at the time that would have been given information on it.
*23:47.360- 23:51.720* :  I think she could have been stabbed in and saved. Kevin Winchers is a solicitor for several other
*23:51.720- 23:58.960* :  victims' families. The stigma for the tight or informant runs very deep in Irish history.
*23:59.960- 24:06.940* :  That stigma extends to the next of kin and the next generation. Indeed, if proof were needed of that,
*24:07.780- 24:14.260* :  we need only look around this room today. There aren't any families and that, to my mind, is very telling.
*24:15.860- 24:21.460* :  Families still feel uncomfortable about being in the public domain in relation to these matters.
*24:22.160- 24:26.860* :  Operation Canova is not over. A detailed report is yet to come,
*24:26.860- 24:31.960* :  but today's developments of Shauna Light into dark corners of the so-called
*24:31.960- 24:38.680* :  Dirty War between British intelligence and the IRA. Jennifer O'Leary in Velfast.
*24:39.220- 24:44.620* :  The security forces in Northwest Nigeria are trying to rescue more than 280 children
*24:44.900- 24:49.080* :  kidnapped from a school in Kaduna State. Let's get the details from Mianny Jones.
*24:49.840- 24:54.460* :  The O4TC that they are throwing everything are trying to find these children that were abducted.
*24:54.660- 24:58.280* :  Just 24 hours ago, they were sitting in their morning assembly on Thursday morning,
*24:58.280- 25:03.460* :  when armed men rode into their school compound. It's two schools, a primary and a secondary school,
*25:03.840- 25:08.480* :  right side by side, just separated by a line of trees. And apparently, they're sailing
*25:08.480- 25:13.480* :  rounded up these children and took them into a nearby forest. Some of them managed to escape,
*25:13.580- 25:18.080* :  as well as some of the teachers. They say that they then try to get local militias,
*25:18.080- 25:22.260* :  vigilante groups go after the children. Unfortunately, they weren't successful and one of the
*25:22.260- 25:26.840* :  community members that went after them was killed. We've also now got to use that teenager that
*25:26.840- 25:31.800* :  was a pupil at the school was also killed. Let's go back now to events in the Middle East.
*25:31.800- 25:36.880* :  And while the war has been very much centered on Gaza, violence in the occupied West Bank has
*25:36.880- 25:42.540* :  also been surging since the attacks on October the 7th. More than 400 Palestinians have been
*25:42.540- 25:47.660* :  killed there, as his ready forces search for Hamas militants. 15 Israelis were killed there
*25:47.940- 25:53.360* :  over the same period. The UN says children account for a quarter of the Palestinians killed.
*25:54.060- 25:58.280* :  A special correspondent for Gorkin reports now on the case of 10-year-old Ammanaja
*25:58.720- 26:01.900* :  shot dead last Monday, as he went shopping with his family.
*26:04.500- 26:09.620* :  Then you, Amar Najar, from his beginning in the village of Burin. Now they were burying him.
*26:10.420- 26:15.880* :  10 years old, a schoolboy going shopping with his father. He was killed by Israeli troops.
*26:16.640- 26:23.060* :  So the factions have come to claim him as a martyr. The PLO, the communists, Hamas bear him
*26:23.060- 26:33.000* :  to his grave wrapped in their flanks. There's a single bullet hole in the windscreen of the
*26:33.000- 26:40.860* :  family's van. Amar's blood has dried between the front seats. Eyewitness Jamal Najar said the
*26:40.860- 26:48.720* :  village was quiet as the family's minibus came down the main street. He wasn't talking to anyone.
*26:48.900- 26:57.900* :  He stopped after he saw the soldiers in front of him. Amar's father Muhammad described the
*26:57.900- 27:05.940* :  moment of his son's death. They shot directly at us. So my son Amar was killed immediately.
*27:06.600- 27:11.240* :  He was not injured. He was killed immediately, as he was shot in the head.
*27:15.760- 27:22.340* :  Amar's little brother Ahmed was also there. He was shot. Then he fell and I ran away.
*27:22.340- 27:27.340* :  Ahmed says. They were shooting at the boss. They broke the glass and the bullet passed through
*27:27.340- 27:35.920* :  the window and hidden. In a statement to the BBC, the IDF said it would face a surge in terrorist
*27:35.920- 27:42.100* :  attacks since October 7th, but that it does not target non-competence, including children.
*27:42.980- 27:46.960* :  It said life-fire is only used after all other options have been utilized.
*27:48.040- 27:52.480* :  On the death of Amar Najar, the IDF's response is read by a colleague.
*27:52.820- 27:58.440* :  During IDF counterterrorism activity in the town of Burin, a number of suspects held rocks
*27:58.440- 28:04.220* :  at the soldiers who responded with life-fire. A short while after, a report was received
*28:04.220- 28:10.920* :  regarding a Palestinian minor who had been injured. The circumstances of the incident are under review.
*28:13.240- 28:19.420* :  The UN says children account for a quarter of the 417 Palestinians killed in the West Bank
*28:19.420- 28:24.580* :  since October 7th. 15 Israelis have been killed there in the same period.
*28:24.860- 28:28.860* :  There is no accountability. Nobody here will hold them accountable. They are protected even.
*28:28.860- 28:32.780* :  Khaled Kuzmar, director of the International Defense of Children Palestine,
*28:32.780- 28:39.020* :  says soldiers act with impunity, and should be held to account by the international criminal court.
*28:39.660- 28:46.860* :  So I believe that if there is an international accountability system in force,
*28:47.080- 28:51.960* :  I'm sure they will change their mind. I'm not sure that all of them will stop,
*28:52.480- 28:57.440* :  but at least I know that there will be something different than now.
*29:00.540- 29:05.640* :  Burin is overlooked by Jewish settlements built on land confiscated from Palestinian villagers.
*29:06.680- 29:10.240* :  Settlers have been filmed attacking villagers, destroying their crops.
*29:11.120- 29:16.680* :  The military has been accused of repeatedly siding with the settlers of failing to protect villagers.
*29:18.380- 29:23.060* :  Since October 7th, settler violence has escalated according to human rights groups,
*29:23.760- 29:30.460* :  with over 600 attacks. Creating what Amr Najar's mother Salam says is a living nightmare.
*29:34.200- 29:36.940* :  I don't let my children out of the house fearing they'll kill them,
*29:37.420- 29:39.760* :  and I go get them from school so they don't get killed.
*29:40.520- 29:44.100* :  And then my child's destiny was to get killed here in the town.
*29:44.900- 29:48.360* :  As much as I try to protect my child, he's gone from me.
*29:56.640- 30:01.920* :  To Japan now are the creator of one of the most influential comics of all time has died.
*30:01.920- 30:07.280* :  This is Akira Toriyama, the artist behind the mega hit Dragon Ball. He was 68.
*30:07.280- 30:13.480* :  His manga art is appreciated around the world and is also found in cartoons, films and video games.
*30:14.040- 30:16.940* :  Our art correspondent David Sillato looks back at his career.
*30:17.620- 30:24.500* :  For millions, the adventures of Goku with his black, spiky hair in Dragon Ball was part of childhood.
*30:25.200- 30:27.400* :  Goku, you think you've got enough firewood there?
*30:28.760- 30:31.200* :  Yeah, this should last us a while, don't you think?
*30:31.200- 30:35.320* :  The creation of Akira Toriyama, he was more than just another cartoon.
*30:35.320- 30:40.540* :  Toriyama's work was for millions around the world, their first introduction to Japanese manga,
*30:40.780- 30:44.840* :  an anime. One reflection of his importance is that his death has been marked
*30:44.840- 30:48.920* :  by official statements from the governments of both Japan and China.
*30:50.880- 30:56.100* :  And in Japan craft, a manga store in London the fans were arriving to mark this moment.
*30:56.540- 31:00.440* :  My first manga, when I was in my cousins, gave it to me to read it.
*31:00.440- 31:03.960* :  It was exactly as I wanted like a little boy, just like pure action, that kind of thing.
*31:04.200- 31:05.920* :  I have watched this when I was young.
*31:06.260- 31:07.560* :  So Dragon Ball was the beginning of it?
*31:07.600- 31:11.100* :  Yeah, yeah, for sure. I have been forced to watch it, but as some of you was nice.
*31:11.100- 31:14.800* :  I like have a lot of artists friends, and it's hit all of them really hard.
*31:14.960- 31:18.960* :  Means a lot to me. I've always appreciated Toriyama's expression in his comedy.
*31:18.960- 31:22.280* :  Toriyama was an artist who largely avoided publicity.
*31:22.280- 31:26.360* :  He did appear occasionally in his own comics, but only in the form of a robot.
*31:26.360- 31:32.200* :  Toriyama, however, his fame is global, especially after Covid helped supercharge
*31:32.200- 31:35.400* :  interest in manga. Japan crafts Jeremy Bart.
*31:35.880- 31:39.920* :  When the Covid started, the average of percentage of consumptions for the UK market
*31:39.920- 31:41.800* :  increased by 400%.
*31:41.940- 31:43.500* :  So the demand went way higher.
*31:43.580- 31:50.300* :  Akira Toriyama, an artist who helped supercharge one of Japan's most potent exports with Google.
*31:52.260- 31:56.480* :  A spiky-haired, super-powered, cartoon, radish farmer.
*31:58.120- 32:00.360* :  Our answer is David Sillato reporting.
