*01:14.000- 01:16.180* :  I'm Andrew Peach, and at two o'clock on Monday,
*01:16.180- 01:18.860* :  the 18th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:19.500- 01:22.240* :  Israel tells Palestinians to evacuate the area
*01:22.240- 01:25.400* :  around Al-Shifa Hospital as its forces raid the facility.
*01:26.100- 01:29.220* :  A new report, backed by the UN, says famine is expected
*01:29.220- 01:30.380* :  in Northern Gaza.
*01:30.960- 01:33.140* :  The latest from Haiti as an aid agency
*01:33.140- 01:35.640* :  compares life in the capital to a horror film.
*01:38.360- 01:41.960* :  Also in this podcast, why the English pop star Ed Sheeran...
*01:46.640- 01:48.220* :  ..is singing in Punjabi.
*01:52.040- 01:54.300* :  Let's start though in Gaza, where UN-backed reports
*01:54.300- 01:57.040* :  as famine is imminent in the north of the strip.
*01:57.540- 02:00.400* :  Around half of Gaza's population is already facing
*02:00.400- 02:02.740* :  catastrophic hunger after five months
*02:02.740- 02:04.720* :  of military bombardment from Israel.
*02:05.320- 02:07.540* :  Speaking at a Gaza aid conference in Brussels,
*02:07.540- 02:10.740* :  the European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Barrel,
*02:11.020- 02:14.020* :  went further saying famine was already present in Gaza
*02:14.440- 02:16.120* :  and Israel was provoking it.
*02:16.600- 02:20.220* :  In Gaza, we are no longer on the brink of famine.
*02:21.540- 02:26.700* :  We are in a state of famine affecting thousands of people.
*02:27.340- 02:30.160* :  This famine is not a natural disaster.
*02:31.580- 02:33.220* :  It's not a flood, it's not a earthquake.
*02:34.460- 02:36.420* :  It's entirely man-made.
*02:37.440- 02:37.760* :  By whom?
*02:39.700- 02:40.700* :  That's there to say it.
*02:40.920- 02:41.280* :  By whom?
*02:42.180- 02:45.280* :  Well, yes, Israel is provoking famine.
*02:46.280- 02:48.800* :  Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz hit back
*02:48.800- 02:52.500* :  at Mr. Barrel on social media, saying stop attacking Israel
*02:52.920- 02:55.360* :  and recognise it's right to self-defense against
*02:55.360- 02:59.520* :  Hamas crimes, also saying Israel allows humanitarian aid
*02:59.520- 03:02.060* :  into Gaza by land, air and sea.
*03:02.460- 03:04.560* :  Our correspondent, Mark Glowin, is in Jerusalem.
*03:05.180- 03:07.220* :  This is a report by a body that brings together
*03:07.220- 03:10.620* :  about dozen UN agencies and aid groups.
*03:11.280- 03:13.920* :  And they say that famine is imminent in the northern part
*03:13.920- 03:17.820* :  of the Gaza strip in an area where about 300,350,000 people
*03:17.820- 03:18.840* :  are still trapped.
*03:19.280- 03:23.460* :  This is a prediction that famine could be declared between now and May,
*03:23.780- 03:28.500* :  that the famine threshold for acute food insecurity,
*03:28.500- 03:30.300* :  as they put it, has already been far exceeded.
*03:30.780- 03:34.100* :  They talk about acute malnutrition among children under the age of five,
*03:34.100- 03:39.360* :  which is proceeding very, very fast, and that over one million people,
*03:39.360- 03:45.020* :  but almost half the population of Gaza have completely exhausted their food supplies,
*03:45.020- 03:47.880* :  and are struggling with catastrophic hunger.
*03:48.360- 03:51.180* :  So that is a very, very shocking statistic,
*03:51.180- 03:55.560* :  and the famine to be declared, I mean, it's a technical thing, actually,
*03:55.560- 03:59.420* :  about a fifth of the population needs to be suffering
*03:59.420- 04:00.680* :  from extreme food shortages.
*04:01.280- 04:05.680* :  So it's been declared twice in the past 13 years in Somalia, in 2011,
*04:05.680- 04:07.660* :  parts of South Sudan in 2017.
*04:08.200- 04:14.500* :  So if it is actually declared in Gaza, that is a rare and very shocking illustration
*04:14.560- 04:17.200* :  of just how dire the needs are on the ground.
*04:17.440- 04:21.400* :  The reports also really clear that it's not too late to turn this around.
*04:21.400- 04:26.880* :  I guess because they know that there are lorry loads of food waiting at the border
*04:26.880- 04:28.820* :  with Egypt to get into Gaza and whatever.
*04:28.820- 04:31.520* :  So it's pretty clear this can be fixed.
*04:32.460- 04:35.280* :  Yes, I mean, it said that the crisis could be resolved and reversed
*04:35.280- 04:39.840* :  through proper political will in their words, and that Gaza could be flooded
*04:39.840- 04:42.500* :  with food through land crossings.
*04:43.000- 04:45.580* :  Now, this is these comments also which have been echoed by the head
*04:45.580- 04:48.520* :  of the local UN body, Philippe Lazarini,
*04:49.100- 04:52.480* :  who he's the head of Unwa, which is the UN agency for Palestine refugees,
*04:52.480- 04:56.800* :  and he was actually denied entry to Gaza earlier on Monday by the Israeli authorities.
*04:57.420- 05:00.960* :  Now, the relationship between the UN and Israel has is very poor now,
*05:01.520- 05:04.940* :  particularly after the allegations made by Israel earlier in the year
*05:04.940- 05:09.360* :  that more than a dozen UN employees in Gaza were,
*05:10.020- 05:14.300* :  Israel says complicit in the attacks, the Hamas attacks of the 7th of October on Israel.
*05:15.080- 05:19.400* :  That report and those allegations led to several Western countries
*05:19.400- 05:22.640* :  halting their financing of the UN mission for Palestinians.
*05:23.780- 05:28.960* :  So I think that, you know, there is a very difficult, tricky relationship now
*05:28.960- 05:33.320* :  to go through and to manage, and I think that Israel will no doubt
*05:33.320- 05:37.220* :  hit back at this report as yet more evidence of more fear mongering from the UN.
*05:37.780- 05:42.300* :  That said, Israel stands accused of closing too many crossings
*05:42.440- 05:44.140* :  for trucks for overland aid to get in,
*05:44.480- 05:48.860* :  and of subjecting food trucks to extremely cumbersome checks
*05:48.900- 05:50.540* :  that have slowed down the delivery of aid.
*05:50.540- 05:54.840* :  So, you know, it is no surprise that aid is severely lacking
*05:54.840- 05:58.020* :  and that if Israel were to change policy on its overland access,
*05:58.540- 05:59.640* :  that could potentially be reversed.
*06:00.180- 06:01.620* :  Mark Loin with me from Jerusalem.
*06:02.440- 06:05.940* :  So the formalities of Vladimir Putin being reelected as Russian President
*06:05.940- 06:07.220* :  are all done and dusted.
*06:07.660- 06:10.900* :  He's been celebrating his victory and has been congratulated by allies
*06:10.900- 06:13.280* :  such as China, Iran and North Korea.
*06:13.660- 06:18.280* :  The EU and the US, though, have denounced his victory referring to the vote as a pseudo-election.
*06:18.900- 06:21.700* :  Mr Putin signaled he'd prioritized the conflict in Ukraine,
*06:21.700- 06:24.440* :  saying the results showed Russians had given him their trust
*06:24.440- 06:26.520* :  and would allow the country to become stronger.
*06:26.980- 06:28.860* :  His words here spoken through an interpreter.
*06:34.080- 06:37.100* :  We have a lot of specific important tasks ahead.
*06:37.100- 06:41.340* :  The result of the election signifies trust
*06:42.700- 06:45.700* :  on the part of the country's citizens and their hope
*06:47.040- 06:49.660* :  that we will do just as we planned.
*06:50.960- 06:54.580* :  I'd like to thank all of you and all citizens of this country
*06:54.580- 06:57.280* :  for their support and for this trust.
*06:57.580- 06:58.600* :  Thank you very much.
*06:59.900- 07:04.440* :  Mikhail Kasyanov was Mr Putin's prime minister for four years from the year 2000.
*07:04.440- 07:08.280* :  He now leads the opposition people's freedom party from Latvia.
*07:08.660- 07:12.780* :  He told the BBC the election was a farce and only served to further Putin's aims.
*07:13.280- 07:15.520* :  That is, of course, not an election at all.
*07:15.980- 07:18.700* :  I would call it special electoral operation,
*07:19.500- 07:21.760* :  which goes as Mr Putin plans.
*07:21.760- 07:26.960* :  In fact, he wanted to have a demonstration of consideration of people,
*07:26.980- 07:32.580* :  and he wanted to demonstrate that the majority of Russian support him
*07:32.580- 07:35.500* :  and his criminal war against Ukraine
*07:35.500- 07:40.820* :  and they will do their best to feel Russian hats
*07:40.820- 07:44.960* :  with this information, with this feeling that consideration took place.
*07:45.820- 07:47.020* :  So what happens next?
*07:47.340- 07:50.320* :  I've been talking to our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.
*07:51.020- 07:55.380* :  You didn't need a crystal ball or tea leaves to predict this landslide victory.
*07:55.380- 08:00.320* :  I mean, remember the Kremlin controls very tightly the political system in Russia
*08:00.320- 08:01.740* :  and that includes elections.
*08:02.320- 08:07.000* :  Then you have to consider the fact that he didn't face any serious challenge in this election.
*08:07.180- 08:09.160* :  Yes, there were other candidates running.
*08:09.160- 08:10.460* :  There were three other candidates.
*08:11.020- 08:14.100* :  But all three were MPs from the Kremlin-friendly parliament,
*08:14.520- 08:18.820* :  not prominent figures that in my Putin dominated the airwaves, TV screens.
*08:19.820- 08:22.500* :  This was always going to be a Putin landslide, I think.
*08:22.660- 08:25.500* :  So does it change anything at all the outcome of this election?
*08:26.080- 08:27.680* :  Hmm, it's an interesting question.
*08:27.720- 08:30.960* :  What will Putin do in his fifth presidential term?
*08:30.960- 08:36.980* :  I don't think that Putin Mark V will be much different from Putin Mark IV, really.
*08:37.860- 08:40.660* :  What you see now is what you're going to get, I think,
*08:41.340- 08:43.980* :  because the direction of travel of Russia is pretty clear.
*08:43.980- 08:49.960* :  It has been for the last two years since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
*08:49.960- 08:55.880* :  So I think what we can expect now is continued confrontation with the West
*08:56.340- 08:58.080* :  by continuation of the war in Ukraine,
*08:58.800- 09:01.500* :  and continued repression at home,
*09:01.500- 09:06.520* :  a continuation of the crackdown on dissent and Russian civil society.
*09:06.520- 09:13.200* :  But the thing is that this astronomical figure of 87% this landslide,
*09:13.800- 09:18.960* :  that will allow Vladimir Putin now to claim that he has the overwhelming support of his people
*09:18.960- 09:22.520* :  that the Russian people have rallied around the flag and around the president.
*09:23.200- 09:28.120* :  And that will allow him to claim that he has this huge public mandate for whatever he does,
*09:28.720- 09:33.440* :  including the war in Ukraine, but also for the changes he's making to Russia as well.
*09:33.780- 09:35.960* :  He's clearly going to continue in Ukraine.
*09:36.380- 09:40.620* :  Are there any other areas bordering Russia,
*09:40.620- 09:47.000* :  which Putin might consider ancient Russian lands that he has in his sights next?
*09:47.500- 09:52.620* :  Well, there has been some concern regarding Moldova and a possible escalation there.
*09:52.880- 09:53.920* :  We'll have to wait and see.
*09:54.660- 10:00.420* :  I suspect that the Kremlin will now send a message to the United States to Washington.
*10:00.420- 10:04.260* :  And the message will be something like, you know, get used to it.
*10:04.360- 10:08.420* :  I've got another six years in the Kremlin. You're going to have to find a way to work with me
*10:08.460- 10:12.480* :  because the message of this election is he's not going anywhere.
*10:12.820- 10:15.000* :  And also, that's the message to the Russian political elite.
*10:15.000- 10:23.220* :  This 87% figure on paper allows Vladimir Putin to send a strong message to his own political elite.
*10:23.760- 10:26.340* :  Take note, I'm the man who's still in charge.
*10:26.340- 10:31.140* :  I'm the man who's still in control and the only one on the political stage here.
*10:31.480- 10:35.560* :  And just can be a sense, finally Steve, what's the reaction among Russian people in Moscow,
*10:35.560- 10:37.680* :  in other cities around the country?
*10:37.680- 10:41.260* :  Because usually when there's been a national election, a presidential election,
*10:41.260- 10:44.800* :  it feels like a big moment. Everybody's talking about it. What's everyone saying?
*10:45.180- 10:49.640* :  You talk about this big moment. You're absolutely right. Very often, elections are big moments.
*10:50.200- 10:53.620* :  You don't get the feeling that this was a big moment.
*10:54.220- 10:56.740* :  And I think many people resigned to the result.
*10:56.740- 11:00.220* :  Many people expected this result. It has not come as a surprise.
*11:00.220- 11:04.200* :  As I say, the Kremlin tightly controls everything here.
*11:04.540- 11:07.020* :  So a Putin landslide was expected.
*11:07.660- 11:15.760* :  It's an interesting question, whether this 87% actually reflects the true attitude of the Russian people to Vladimir Putin.
*11:16.240- 11:19.840* :  I would say, from my conversations with Russians over the years,
*11:20.360- 11:23.560* :  even a lot of people who say they vote for Vladimir Putin do so,
*11:23.960- 11:29.760* :  not because they idolize him or they love him, but they see no alternative to him.
*11:29.760- 11:31.940* :  They say, well, if not Putin, then who?
*11:32.600- 11:34.240* :  Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg.
*11:34.800- 11:39.120* :  The UN Children's Agency Chief has described the chaotic situation in Haiti
*11:39.520- 11:46.160* :  as almost like a scene out of Mad Max, the film which depicted a violent and lawless post-apocalyptic future.
*11:46.660- 11:51.640* :  The United Nations estimates that 350,000 people have been displaced by the unrest,
*11:51.640- 11:55.760* :  as violent gangs rule the streets and swathes of the Capitol Port of Prince.
*11:56.400- 12:01.920* :  Our Central America correspondent, Will Grant, is one of the first journalists to get to Haiti in cover events there.
*12:02.280- 12:06.260* :  He reports now from Cap Haitian, where the U.S. has been evacuating citizens.
*12:09.120- 12:13.680* :  Around 60 U.S. citizens took up their government's offer and flew out of the country to Florida.
*12:14.320- 12:19.780* :  One of those on board, agricultural scientist Brian Conz, said while he had no sense of panic,
*12:19.780- 12:21.880* :  it was also time for him to leave.
*12:22.240- 12:25.960* :  I was scheduled for two weeks ago. That was scheduled more than a month out.
*12:26.700- 12:28.820* :  So I have worked to get back to in the U.S.
*12:28.980- 12:31.160* :  So this is not in emergencies.
*12:35.040- 12:39.000* :  For millions of Haitians, though, the situation most certainly is in emergency
*12:39.700- 12:43.200* :  and leaving on a flight to the U.S. isn't a luxury which is available to them.
*12:43.920- 12:46.600* :  At the bus terminal in the coastal city of Cap Haitian,
*12:46.940- 12:51.960* :  passengers from the gang-controlled Capitol Port of Prince disembarked following a harrowing journey.
*12:56.420- 13:00.540* :  The driver made us crouch down in our seats as we drove through gang checkpoints,
*13:00.540- 13:03.160* :  said one passenger who didn't want to give his name.
*13:04.280- 13:08.700* :  Clearly shaken by the experience, he said the road was controlled by gunmen and bandits
*13:08.700- 13:12.960* :  from several different groups, and the passengers heard gunfire as they were driving.
*13:17.520- 13:20.180* :  Gang violence has been going on for many months in Haiti.
*13:20.880- 13:25.500* :  In that time, huge numbers of people have been forced to leave their homes for fear of their lives.
*13:26.720- 13:30.000* :  Fanel Pied arrived from Port of Prince six months ago.
*13:30.700- 13:35.340* :  He'd been a successful businessman, running a company importing construction materials.
*13:36.300- 13:42.460* :  However, the gangs took it all from him, destroying his business, ransacking his home and trying to kidnap him.
*13:43.400- 13:48.600* :  He and his family are safe, but now live in abject poverty, he told me through an interpreter.
*13:52.960- 13:54.360* :  I'm alive, but I'm not leaving.
*13:55.040- 13:59.080* :  The house I live is seven bedrooms where I can live with my wife, my kids,
*13:59.080- 14:01.780* :  to date and I can't even afford a bed.
*14:02.160- 14:06.200* :  As I need to be somewhere, as I need to stay alive, I'm here.
*14:06.620- 14:09.360* :  But morally, emotionally, I'm nothing.
*14:13.400- 14:15.920* :  Meanwhile, the gangs have taken on a frightening new tone.
*14:16.540- 14:19.520* :  An armed group called Unite Village de Dieu
*14:19.720- 14:24.360* :  have released a slickly produced video which shows them dressed in black combat gear,
*14:24.800- 14:26.180* :  wielding automatic rifles.
*14:26.780- 14:32.340* :  Apparently ready to take on the Haitian police or any international security force which might be deployed here.
*14:32.980- 14:34.720* :  We have a situation of Aladdin.
*14:35.760- 14:40.200* :  Because the gangs become another institution of this state.
*14:40.820- 14:44.580* :  Yuri Latotu was the president of the Senate in 2017.
*14:45.780- 14:48.140* :  In a sign of the dysfunction in the country's politics,
*14:48.200- 14:53.240* :  he's currently under U.S. sanctions for alleged links to drug trafficking and armed criminal gangs,
*14:53.240- 14:55.840* :  something he robustly denies.
*14:56.480- 15:00.720* :  Instead, he blames Washington's deposed ally, Prime Minister Ali Elonbri,
*15:01.180- 15:03.060* :  and had some advice for the U.S.
*15:03.480- 15:07.000* :  Don't come and try to do everything.
*15:07.760- 15:13.460* :  Let work together, and I take at this moment we have a better reason.
*15:15.940- 15:18.960* :  In the face of Haiti's biggest humanitarian emergency in years,
*15:19.580- 15:21.340* :  aid is still only trickling in.
*15:22.120- 15:25.960* :  The need is urgent with hundreds of thousands facing family-like conditions.
*15:27.140- 15:29.820* :  With no sign of a joined-up international response yet,
*15:30.440- 15:33.800* :  long queues of traders form at the border with the Dominican Republic
*15:33.800- 15:35.860* :  to bring in urgently needed supplies,
*15:36.720- 15:40.480* :  even if they must physically carry them into Haiti one load at a time.
*15:41.600- 15:42.620* :  We'll grant in Haiti.
*15:43.400- 15:47.460* :  An attempt to eradicate invasive fire ants from Australia
*15:47.460- 15:51.520* :  has been called an absolute shambles after a government inquiry war.
*15:51.520- 15:53.980* :  They now pose a bigger threat to humans and livestock
*15:54.620- 15:59.260* :  than wild dogs, feral cats, camels, cane toads and foxes combined.
*15:59.260- 16:01.100* :  But what makes them so dangerous?
*16:01.500- 16:03.920* :  A question Alex Richardson put to Phil Mercer,
*16:03.920- 16:05.780* :  who's been following the story from Sydney.
*16:06.380- 16:08.560* :  Well, you speak to experts in this country, Alex,
*16:08.620- 16:13.660* :  and they say that fire ants are one of the world's worst invasive species,
*16:13.660- 16:17.740* :  and they warn that they are on the march across Australia.
*16:17.740- 16:21.500* :  Health experts have told this parliamentary inquiry
*16:22.160- 16:25.720* :  that was set up by lawmakers in October of last year
*16:26.260- 16:30.320* :  that thousands of Australians could develop severe allergic reactions.
*16:30.480- 16:34.740* :  If these ants become endemic in this country,
*16:35.220- 16:39.460* :  they are animals or creatures that invariably attack on mass.
*16:39.820- 16:43.380* :  They swarm, inflict multiple stings,
*16:43.420- 16:46.200* :  their jaws lock onto a victim's skin.
*16:46.200- 16:50.820* :  They arch their bodies and inject venom through a stinger
*16:51.120- 16:53.020* :  or a spike on their abdomen,
*16:53.020- 16:59.840* :  and the authorities in Canberra investigating the health, social and economic consequences
*17:00.600- 17:01.880* :  of these fire ants.
*17:02.860- 17:04.300* :  Well, can they be got rid of?
*17:04.940- 17:09.360* :  It was first detective in the Queensland City of Brisbane back in 2001,
*17:09.360- 17:15.200* :  but it's most likely that they were here undetected for up to 20 years,
*17:15.880- 17:18.580* :  probably hitching a ride in a shipping container
*17:18.580- 17:24.160* :  that have spread across Queensland's southern border into parts of New South Wales.
*17:24.160- 17:27.140* :  They have been found at major ports,
*17:27.400- 17:30.480* :  so all around Australia, apart from Tasmania,
*17:31.100- 17:35.260* :  and scientists say that Australia's climate and a lack of natural predators
*17:35.980- 17:41.880* :  makes the island continent of Australia a perfect home for these fiery insects.
*17:42.320- 17:44.940* :  Because there are, as you say, all over the world,
*17:45.060- 17:46.960* :  there are a big problem in the United States too,
*17:46.960- 17:49.940* :  and efforts to eradicate them or control their numbers
*17:49.940- 17:52.840* :  have not amounted to much so far.
*17:53.460- 17:55.980* :  Well, millions of people are stung each year in the United States.
*17:55.980- 17:58.960* :  These are creatures that are on the march,
*17:58.960- 18:01.940* :  not just in the US, but also here in Australia,
*18:02.160- 18:04.840* :  other parts of the world, including China.
*18:05.440- 18:10.540* :  Now, the success and progress of Australia's efforts to contain
*18:10.540- 18:13.960* :  and eradicate fire ants are coming under great scrutiny.
*18:13.960- 18:17.900* :  The Queensland State Government, for example, says that its response
*18:17.960- 18:21.960* :  to the fire ant invasion has been world-class,
*18:21.960- 18:27.980* :  but critics say that mismanagement and incompetence has allowed the fire ant
*18:27.980- 18:31.920* :  to spread, and they say that this is an absolute tragedy,
*18:32.580- 18:36.720* :  and the fire ants, they believe, spreading out of control across the country.
*18:37.200- 18:38.320* :  Filmers are in Sydney.
*18:38.980- 18:42.760* :  Hundreds of people have taken to the streets of Cuba's second city Santiago
*18:42.760- 18:46.940* :  in a rare protest, sparked by a fresh wave of blackouts and food shortages.
*18:47.800- 18:49.260* :  Here's the BBC's Tom Bailey.
*18:49.780- 18:52.940* :  Tensions have soared in recent weeks on the communist run island,
*18:52.940- 18:55.340* :  amid a worsening economic crisis,
*18:55.900- 18:58.440* :  but demonstrations such as this remain rare.
*18:59.080- 19:02.860* :  In a series of posts on social media President Miguel Diaz Canal
*19:02.860- 19:05.600* :  acknowledged the protests and said he was listening,
*19:06.140- 19:09.600* :  but accused the United States of seeking to ferment unrest.
*19:09.600- 19:14.620* :  The government continues to blame US sanctions for the dire state of the economy,
*19:15.060- 19:18.440* :  but critics say mismanagement is behind the current crisis.
*19:19.440- 19:22.820* :  For the first time in almost a decade, the number of couples in China
*19:22.820- 19:25.100* :  choosing to tie the knot has gone up.
*19:25.540- 19:30.720* :  In fact, compared to 2023, government data shows a 12.4 percent increase
*19:30.720- 19:31.960* :  in people getting married.
*19:32.520- 19:36.380* :  Faced with low birth rates, Beijing has been pushing hard to promote marriage
*19:36.780- 19:39.800* :  as our Asia Pacific Regional Editor, Celia Hatten, told me.
*19:40.240- 19:44.740* :  Well, I think it's really what we've seen in many places around the world post COVID.
*19:44.740- 19:49.300* :  You know, China had a very strict COVID lockdown right up to the end of 2022,
*19:49.300- 19:53.640* :  when they lifted it. It's not maybe that surprising that we saw quite a few couples
*19:53.640- 19:58.360* :  deciding in 2023 that that's when they wanted to tie the knot.
*19:58.360- 20:02.540* :  There's also been a massive government push behind the idea of marriage,
*20:02.660- 20:04.860* :  promoting marriage as a really good thing to do,
*20:05.140- 20:08.960* :  and even doing really simple things to make it easier for couples to tie the knot.
*20:08.960- 20:13.480* :  They now have to get fewer permissions from employers, for example.
*20:13.480- 20:17.500* :  They've even published marriage certificate applications in Braille,
*20:17.580- 20:22.400* :  so couples who are blind, it's easier for them to get through those processes.
*20:22.440- 20:26.660* :  So it's this whole thing that the government really wants to push the idea
*20:26.660- 20:28.140* :  that marriage equals stability.
*20:28.360- 20:30.160* :  Why is the government so keen for people to get married?
*20:30.320- 20:33.580* :  Well, the real thing that they want is to push the birth rate.
*20:33.580- 20:37.300* :  The birth rate in China is half that that it was in 2016,
*20:37.300- 20:40.660* :  and that's caused real anxiety in China.
*20:40.840- 20:45.440* :  If the population continues to shrink, the population is aging very rapidly.
*20:45.440- 20:50.720* :  They're just simply aren't enough future workers to be able to support China's aging society.
*20:50.720- 20:54.780* :  So they're doing a whole bunch of things to try to encourage couples
*20:54.780- 20:57.900* :  to first get married and then to have children.
*20:57.900- 21:01.860* :  They're doing things like encouraging couples to share child raising,
*21:01.860- 21:05.920* :  decreasing the costs of childcare, decreasing the costs of education,
*21:05.920- 21:10.580* :  because China is one of the most expensive places in the world to raise a child.
*21:10.580- 21:14.480* :  And so that's why China really wants couples to get married
*21:14.480- 21:17.440* :  because in their eyes, marriage and childbirth are intertwined.
*21:17.600- 21:20.200* :  But there are other forces pushing in the other direction.
*21:20.320- 21:23.600* :  So a lot of young people, young women specifically are not that keen.
*21:23.940- 21:27.540* :  That's right, women are really rejecting the idea of marriage.
*21:28.140- 21:35.160* :  Women in China are the ones who are overwhelming the ones who are getting undergraduate, university degrees, graduate degrees.
*21:35.740- 21:37.880* :  So they're rejecting the pressure to get married,
*21:37.880- 21:42.660* :  and therefore maybe diminish their career chances after having children
*21:43.260- 21:46.960* :  also property laws in China overwhelmingly favor men.
*21:46.960- 21:52.900* :  That's because in 2011 laws were changed that only one name could go on a property deed.
*21:52.900- 21:56.940* :  And that usually doesn't favor the woman in the event of a divorce.
*21:56.940- 22:00.960* :  All that property goes to whoever's name is on the deed, it's not shared.
*22:00.960- 22:04.920* :  So many women are seeing this and they're rejecting the idea of time and not.
*22:05.480- 22:07.900* :  Asia-Pacific Regional Editor, Celia Hatton.
*22:10.680- 22:11.800* :  Still to come in this podcast?
*22:12.440- 22:14.800* :  800 scientists have said we should not be...
*22:17.840- 22:21.380* :  At Airbus, we're at the forefront of new technology.
*22:22.560- 22:26.740* :  We're redefining the aerospace industry by using disruptive technologies
*22:27.320- 22:30.740* :  and new energies to reduce our environmental impact.
*22:30.740- 22:32.120* :  Okay, thank you very much.
*22:32.540- 22:37.680* :  We're bringing the world together, collaborating and acting on climate change.
*22:38.380- 22:44.100* :  At Airbus, we're pioneering sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world.

*22:50.560- 22:53.060* :  Positioning right now to actually mining.
*22:53.680- 22:56.480* :  The battle over deep sea mining intensifies.
*23:03.400- 23:06.560* :  Hi, Namulantokombo here with some very exciting news.
*23:07.160- 23:11.040* :  My award-winning podcast, Dear Daughter, is back for a new series.
*23:11.640- 23:14.580* :  I'm putting together a handbook to life for daughters everywhere.
*23:15.080- 23:17.560* :  Collecting letters from listeners from all over the world,
*23:18.040- 23:20.420* :  full of stories and advice to help navigate life.
*23:20.840- 23:22.780* :  And I'm joined by some very special guests,
*23:23.280- 23:25.740* :  sharing their experiences and words of wisdom too.
*23:26.240- 23:29.140* :  That's Dear Daughter from the BBC World Service.
*23:29.600- 23:31.720* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*23:33.560- 23:37.920* :  The Democratic Republic of Congo has lifted a 20-year moratorium on the death penalty
*23:38.380- 23:41.160* :  as the government looks to curb violence in eastern Congo
*23:41.160- 23:43.080* :  where battles have been intensifying.
*23:43.640- 23:47.400* :  According to the Justice Ministry, the 2003 ban on the death penalty
*23:47.400- 23:51.200* :  allowed people accused of treason or espionage to escape justice.
*23:51.840- 23:54.960* :  Some civil society groups have criticized the government's decision.
*23:55.660- 23:58.900* :  My colleague, Victoria O'Hunder, spoke to Tracy Bebo Tansier,
*23:58.900- 24:02.560* :  who works for Triple 11, a global civil society organization.
*24:03.100- 24:08.380* :  We think that this decision is not the way to fight the war in the eastern of TRC.
*24:08.920- 24:10.660* :  With the dysfunctional justice system,
*24:11.080- 24:15.760* :  this is going to be very tricky to really know who are these traders,
*24:15.760- 24:19.260* :  who are these people who are collaborating with the enemy,
*24:19.260- 24:22.160* :  then in Congo is the M23 terrorist group.
*24:22.680- 24:25.180* :  So we think that as a human rights organization,
*24:25.260- 24:28.620* :  this is not the way to treat any human.
*24:29.260- 24:32.460* :  What is the best way then to fight the violence in the east?
*24:33.820- 24:36.840* :  I think a big reform of the army is very important.
*24:36.880- 24:40.620* :  We need to continue to invest as a country DRC in diplomacy
*24:41.580- 24:43.640* :  and also the reform of a justice system
*24:43.640- 24:46.500* :  that is now at this moment already dysfunctional.
*24:47.120- 24:50.560* :  And speaking to people I imagine in the DRC,
*24:50.720- 24:52.740* :  in Kinshasa Menli, the capital,
*24:53.220- 24:55.220* :  what has been the reaction among the people?
*24:56.780- 24:58.620* :  I think the people have mixed feelings.
*24:58.780- 25:01.980* :  In a way, they see that the president is trying to fight the war
*25:01.980- 25:05.960* :  and to fight the impunity that has been going on for 30 years,
*25:05.960- 25:08.880* :  but they are scared that we will go backwards
*25:09.600- 25:11.940* :  and we will go back in the time from the former president,
*25:11.940- 25:16.700* :  Laurent Desricabilla, where petty crimes, people who were accused of petty crimes,
*25:16.700- 25:18.900* :  thieves were just executed in states.
*25:19.640- 25:21.680* :  So this is in stage, I'm sorry.
*25:21.680- 25:24.020* :  So this is very concerning for a lot of people.
*25:24.560- 25:28.080* :  As Nobel Prize winner Dr. Mukwege said in a press release,
*25:28.080- 25:30.840* :  this is like an authoritarian regime.
*25:31.460- 25:34.440* :  What are the chances that this, the lifting of this ban
*25:34.440- 25:38.540* :  is going to deter anybody, not just even the people
*25:38.540- 25:40.720* :  with the rebel groups in the east of the country?
*25:42.500- 25:45.840* :  So like when we are scared as a human rights group
*25:45.860- 25:48.500* :  that even people who will criticize the regime
*25:48.500- 25:53.340* :  who have maybe one certain link with people from Rwanda will be attacked.
*25:53.380- 25:56.160* :  That's the issue and that's the problem here.
*25:56.540- 25:59.200* :  We want really a ceasefire.
*25:59.640- 26:03.720* :  We want peace, diplomacy and the reform of the justice system.
*26:04.140- 26:05.180* :  That can be an issue.
*26:05.520- 26:07.880* :  We are scared with this measure.
*26:08.480- 26:11.620* :  A lot of innocent people will be also included.
*26:12.240- 26:14.060* :  When you say innocent people, what do you mean?
*26:14.680- 26:17.100* :  Because we have a dysfunctional justice system
*26:17.480- 26:19.340* :  and the trials are not always fair.
*26:20.400- 26:23.040* :  How are we sure that these people will be traitors?
*26:23.620- 26:26.120* :  How are we sure that these people will really be the one
*26:26.120- 26:28.580* :  who have been illegally trading minerals?
*26:28.580- 26:30.340* :  Because that is also what it is about,
*26:30.340- 26:33.920* :  that a lot of people in the army have illegally trading minerals.
*26:34.800- 26:37.560* :  What is the best is just a trial, a fair trial,
*26:37.920- 26:39.500* :  and maybe life sentences.
*26:39.500- 26:42.380* :  That is what is already applicable in RDC.
*26:43.780- 26:46.120* :  Next, the environmental campaign group Greenpeace
*26:46.120- 26:49.220* :  is stripped of its observer status after being accused
*26:49.220- 26:51.260* :  of disrupting a research expedition.
*26:51.860- 26:54.500* :  This rower is over mining companies wanting to access
*26:54.500- 26:57.540* :  billions of dollars worth of metals on the seabed.
*26:57.980- 27:00.780* :  Greenpeace says the incident in question was a peaceful protest
*27:00.780- 27:03.120* :  aimed at protecting a pristine ecosystem.
*27:03.720- 27:05.700* :  Louisa Casson is one of its campaigners.
*27:06.100- 27:08.320* :  I think there's a big difference between tick-box science
*27:08.340- 27:10.540* :  by a company that has a clear commercial interest
*27:10.540- 27:11.840* :  in the outcomes of that research,
*27:12.240- 27:13.880* :  an independent scientific research,
*27:13.980- 27:16.000* :  helping us understand the complexity
*27:16.000- 27:18.500* :  and the fragility of deep ocean environments.
*27:18.720- 27:20.400* :  There is so much science out there already,
*27:20.400- 27:22.160* :  which is urging extreme caution.
*27:22.160- 27:25.720* :  800 scientists more than have said we should not be transitioning
*27:25.720- 27:27.940* :  right now to actually mining.
*27:27.980- 27:31.460* :  Member States of the UN's International Seabed Association
*27:31.540- 27:34.820* :  will debate the organization's fate at a meeting in Jamaica.
*27:35.340- 27:37.800* :  Our climate editor Justin Roller has explained more.
*27:38.200- 27:41.380* :  What is controversial because there is a huge store of
*27:41.840- 27:45.140* :  metals that would be suitable for the renewable transition
*27:45.620- 27:49.660* :  in the form of nodules on the deepest parts of the ocean floor,
*27:49.660- 27:51.180* :  the abyssal plane it's called.
*27:51.300- 27:54.500* :  So these nodules form below 4,000 metres.
*27:54.500- 27:55.960* :  So really, really deep.
*27:55.980- 27:57.520* :  It's a huge resource.
*27:58.040- 28:01.000* :  And as we transition to low carbon economy,
*28:01.000- 28:03.880* :  the argument that the mining companies make is we're going to need
*28:03.980- 28:04.960* :  a lot more of these metals.
*28:04.980- 28:08.780* :  And this is a relatively low impact way to get hold of them.
*28:08.820- 28:11.740* :  They argue the alternative would be mining on land.
*28:11.740- 28:14.580* :  Now, the Greens, the environmentalists say,
*28:15.040- 28:16.240* :  listen, this is one of the few.
*28:16.240- 28:19.700* :  Perhaps the only pristine environment left on earth.
*28:19.700- 28:22.060* :  There are all sorts of incredible creatures out there.
*28:22.360- 28:25.140* :  Every time a research expedition goes to the abyssal plane,
*28:25.140- 28:29.440* :  they find new species going in there and mining would be very disrupting.
*28:29.660- 28:31.820* :  The rejoinder from the mining companies is listening.
*28:31.820- 28:35.220* :  The abyssal plane's vast 40% of the earth's surface.
*28:35.540- 28:40.720* :  The entire surface area of land is only 29% of the earth's surface.
*28:40.720- 28:44.440* :  So they say a bit of mining will not do extensive damage
*28:44.640- 28:46.660* :  and is worth it for the green transition.
*28:46.760- 28:49.860* :  So you've got this weird position where both parties are claiming
*28:49.860- 28:53.420* :  to be the greenest claiming to be doing the right thing for the planet.
*28:53.780- 28:57.340* :  And what a green piece doing to try and disrupt the expeditions?
*28:57.980- 29:00.820* :  Well, he won't be surprised to hear that green piece are going out there
*29:00.820- 29:03.540* :  to make their protest in the remote Pacific.
*29:03.540- 29:07.480* :  This is really kind of way out in the depotion.
*29:07.480- 29:11.460* :  And they interrupted a research trip of one of the mining companies,
*29:11.460- 29:13.020* :  a company called The Mattels Company.
*29:13.440- 29:15.080* :  The Mattels Company said, listen, you guys,
*29:15.580- 29:16.920* :  you're disrupting science.
*29:17.040- 29:19.360* :  You're not interested in the science being done
*29:19.360- 29:22.840* :  because you've already decided you don't think we should be mining this.
*29:23.240- 29:27.400* :  They've been mandated to do this work by the International Seabed Authority,
*29:27.400- 29:30.600* :  the UN body that's responsible for the depotions.
*29:30.940- 29:35.680* :  And now the ISA, the Seabed Authority, is holding an inquiry into green pieces,
*29:35.680- 29:39.880* :  actions to decide whether or not they should retain that observer status
*29:40.540- 29:42.800* :  because they say, you know, you should be, you know,
*29:43.160- 29:46.380* :  abide by the work that we're doing to try and understand the challenges
*29:46.380- 29:48.540* :  and the impacts of deep sea mining.
*29:48.920- 29:50.700* :  Our climate editor Justin Rowlett with me.
*29:51.140- 29:53.340* :  And staying on that theme on the other side of the world,
*29:53.820- 29:55.520* :  environmental protesters have been camping
*29:55.520- 29:58.880* :  in the forest outside Elon Musk's test-the-factory in Germany
*29:59.260- 30:00.820* :  over plans to expand the plant.
*30:01.360- 30:03.840* :  Tesla says its teams are enhancing local biodiversity
*30:04.780- 30:06.860* :  and it's creating sustainable factories there.
*30:07.340- 30:09.840* :  Jessica Parker reports from the state of Brandenburg.
*30:12.540- 30:15.620* :  In a pine forest about 30 kilometres outside Berlin,
*30:16.140- 30:17.340* :  I climb a ladder.
*30:18.000- 30:18.960* :  It feels pretty sturdy.
*30:20.420- 30:22.960* :  This is one of several tree houses making up the camp
*30:22.960- 30:25.440* :  near Europe's only Tesla factory.
*30:26.220- 30:29.120* :  These activists want to frustrate plans for the factories
*30:29.780- 30:30.620* :  expansion into the forest.
*30:31.120- 30:33.840* :  But as I find out from one of the campaigners Magpie,
*30:34.020- 30:36.160* :  their protest is about much more.
*30:36.600- 30:39.320* :  We don't want to cut the forest down, we want to save
*30:39.980- 30:41.200* :  or to collect the water here.
*30:41.200- 30:43.260* :  But also it's like a more international fight
*30:43.260- 30:46.320* :  because of course electric cars also use minerals
*30:46.660- 30:47.900* :  which also cause a lot of problems
*30:48.020- 30:50.880* :  in, for example, Chile or Bolivia.
*30:51.160- 30:53.360* :  There's been some suggestion, some of you guys
*30:53.360- 30:55.860* :  are basically professional campaigners
*30:55.900- 30:58.740* :  turning up at lots of protests wherever they may be.
*30:59.560- 31:01.860* :  Of course some people are here who are doing this often
*31:02.040- 31:04.760* :  or sometime, but also a lot of people here
*31:04.760- 31:07.760* :  who live in the village, Grünheider, like coming here
*31:07.760- 31:08.700* :  and helping us.
*31:08.900- 31:10.060* :  Yeah, I also have to work.
*31:11.160- 31:12.940* :  The idea of course is to make a looming
*31:12.940- 31:15.520* :  eviction particularly hard for the authorities.
*31:17.120- 31:19.540* :  As a railway nearby, we bump into commuters.
*31:19.860- 31:22.920* :  A majority of residents in the local town voted against
*31:22.920- 31:25.300* :  the plans, but views are split.
*31:25.820- 31:27.480* :  The expansion proposals include
*31:27.480- 31:30.180* :  a kindergarten for employees, warehouses
*31:30.500- 31:31.840* :  and a freight train station.
*31:32.160- 31:35.140* :  I moved to Grünheider 20 years ago
*31:35.140- 31:38.000* :  because we wanted to be close to the nature
*31:38.000- 31:41.180* :  and we didn't expect that we would have this kind of
*31:41.780- 31:42.580* :  factory here.
*31:42.960- 31:44.840* :  Most of the Tesla employees are happy
*31:44.840- 31:47.060* :  that Tesla is providing work places.
*31:47.460- 31:49.920* :  I personally don't really understand the motivations
*31:49.980- 31:51.520* :  of the people coming here
*31:51.640- 31:53.960* :  and attacking our power system.
*31:55.320- 31:58.840* :  That attack on the power system was a suspected arson attack
*31:59.300- 32:00.800* :  on an electricity pile-on
*32:01.140- 32:04.200* :  that led to factory production being suspended for a week.
*32:05.600- 32:07.700* :  Painters at the camps say that was not them.
*32:08.220- 32:10.480* :  In fact, far-left militant activists
*32:10.480- 32:13.600* :  called the Volcano Group have claimed responsibility.
*32:13.600- 32:15.640* :  Police are investigating.
*32:21.460- 32:25.520* :  A Tesla video sent the message that the factory was booming back to life.
*32:26.140- 32:27.940* :  Elon Musk even visited the plant,
*32:27.940- 32:32.300* :  having described the pile-on saboteurs as dumb eco-terrorists.
*32:32.700- 32:35.960* :  Meanwhile, Tesla says it wants to create sustainable factories
*32:35.960- 32:38.260* :  and support local communities.
*32:39.180- 32:41.920* :  But American powerhouse capitalism is meeting
*32:41.920- 32:44.700* :  radical German eco-activism.
*32:45.240- 32:47.780* :  It's likely that battle isn't over yet.
*32:49.000- 32:50.280* :  Jessica Parker in Germany.
*32:50.800- 32:52.800* :  The British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran
*32:52.800- 32:55.960* :  has set social media ablaze by singing in Punjabi.
*32:55.960- 32:58.940* :  This happened in Mumbai, Ella Bicknell reports.
*33:00.100- 33:02.960* :  And Mumbai, I would like you to make all the noise in the world
*33:02.960- 33:04.420* :  for Deal, Jesus, San!
*33:08.380- 33:09.660* :  Nobody saw it coming.
*33:09.660- 33:13.580* :  One of the world's biggest singer-songwriters singing in Punjabi
*33:13.580- 33:15.760* :  with one of India's rising stars.
*33:28.560- 33:30.920* :  Sporting his T-shirt, Tassiz and guitar,
*33:30.920- 33:33.960* :  he invited the Indian singer, Diljeet Tassange,
*33:33.960- 33:37.180* :  perform Tassange's hit track lover with him on stage.
*33:37.720- 33:39.000* :  And all in Punjabi.
*33:39.660- 33:42.080* :  The performance has gone viral on social media,
*33:42.460- 33:44.960* :  totaling almost two million likes on Instagram.
*33:44.980- 33:49.080* :  One fan said it was the crossover we never knew we needed.
*33:49.560- 33:52.160* :  While Varun Dhuwan, one of India's biggest film stars,
*33:52.160- 33:54.500* :  simply wrote global domination.
*34:01.060- 34:02.720* :  As well as being a huge star in India,
*34:03.040- 34:06.000* :  Tassange is quickly growing his international fanbase.
*34:06.340- 34:09.060* :  Last year, taking the stage of Kachella in California,
*34:09.600- 34:12.380* :  as well as collaborating on a track with cheap thrills
*34:12.480- 34:14.020* :  and chandelier singer, Sia.
*34:17.980- 34:20.400* :  After Saturday's success,
*34:20.400- 34:23.440* :  fans hoped Tassange's next release will be with Sharon,
*34:23.960- 34:26.360* :  who has long celebrated other musical cultures.
*34:33.840- 34:36.880* :  In the past, he's teamed up with Colombian singer Jay Balvin,
*34:37.320- 34:39.460* :  and the Ghanaian rapper, Fuse O.D.G,
*34:39.460- 34:41.860* :  to release tracks in Spanish and Chi.
*34:53.300- 34:55.620* :  And his 2014 hits, thinking out loud,
*34:55.620- 34:58.080* :  was also released in Irish Gaelic.
*34:59.460- 35:02.860* :  This performance in Mumbai is just one of dozens of concerts
*35:02.860- 35:05.740* :  before his world tour wraps up in September.
*35:06.300- 35:09.280* :  Posting on social media, he described his time in Mumbai
*35:09.280- 35:12.620* :  as incredible, hinting there was more to come.
*35:21.640- 35:22.780* :  And that's all from us for now.

*36:47.660- 36:48.960* :  or if it's a safe place,
*36:50.760- 36:51.020* :  or if it's a safe place,
