*00:29.840- 00:31.600* :  I've never really was a salad guy.
*00:31.840- 00:32.780* :  That's just not who I am.

*01:33.260- 01:35.840* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:38.920- 01:41.980* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Wednesday the 13th of March,
*01:41.980- 01:43.400* :  these are our main stories.
*01:43.680- 01:48.300* :  Washington says it expects a transitional council to be appointed in violent,
*01:48.320- 01:52.200* :  hit Haiti soon after the resignation of the Prime Minister.
*01:52.560- 01:57.220* :  The White House is sending $300 million in emergency aid to Ukraine,
*01:57.800- 02:01.360* :  while a much larger package remains blocked by House Republicans.
*02:02.080- 02:07.780* :  The EU's foreign policy chief says starvation is being used as an arm of war in Gaza.
*02:08.360- 02:15.380* :  Also in this podcast, the biggest problem I think in the happiness industry is that we've been
*02:15.380- 02:19.180* :  getting the wrong message. People have been told to look after themselves and focus on themselves,
*02:19.180- 02:21.140* :  but that's exactly the wrong thing you should be doing.
*02:21.520- 02:23.800* :  We show you the right path to bliss.
*02:27.380- 02:32.300* :  We begin with the crisis in Haiti. The US State Department says it expects a transitional
*02:32.300- 02:36.200* :  council in Haiti to be appointed within the next 48 hours.
*02:36.680- 02:40.900* :  Once established, it will nominate a new Prime Minister to succeed Ariel Henri,
*02:40.900- 02:43.380* :  who announced his plans to resign on Monday.
*02:43.880- 02:48.580* :  A day later, at a media briefing, the US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller
*02:48.900- 02:51.440* :  said it had the support of the Biden administration.
*02:51.440- 02:55.800* :  We welcome yesterday's announcement of a transitional governance structure in Haiti,
*02:55.800- 03:00.340* :  which paves the way for a peaceful transition of power, continuity of governance,
*03:00.340- 03:05.340* :  an action plan for near-term security, including the deployment of a multinational security
*03:05.340- 03:08.780* :  support mission, and a pathway to free and fair elections.
*03:08.780- 03:13.180* :  We commend Prime Minister Henri for his statesmanship in putting his country first
*03:13.680- 03:17.280* :  and agreeing to step down when the transitional presidential council is established.
*03:18.040- 03:24.160* :  Security has yet to be improved in the Haitian capital, Porto Prince, since that resignation.
*03:24.440- 03:29.780* :  Even's rumble is the director of communications at the Think Tank policy day.
*03:29.780- 03:32.760* :  He told us about his life now in the capital.
*03:33.240- 03:39.500* :  We cannot stay in a city where we've been hearing, watching all types of violence.
*03:40.080- 03:43.040* :  Where the games are controlling, I can tell you, I don't go there.
*03:43.040- 03:46.900* :  For the past two weeks, they have moved toward where I live, right?
*03:46.900- 03:49.860* :  But now, they have gained a lot of neighborhoods.
*03:50.320- 03:54.560* :  They come, they burn the politicians, and then they move back to their headquarters.
*03:54.800- 03:55.960* :  I'm worried I'll say.
*03:56.460- 04:01.900* :  We've even packed one small suitcase in case they come, and then we don't know where to go.
*04:01.900- 04:03.160* :  We're just going to grab the suitcase.
*04:03.160- 04:04.960* :  That's the situation that I am right now.
*04:06.120- 04:09.980* :  When it remains impossible to deliver essential goods to Porto Prince's residents,
*04:10.720- 04:13.560* :  hospitals and schools are closed and shops are running out of food.
*04:13.560- 04:19.560* :  Plants to deploy a multinational security force to restore order have been put on hold by Kenya,
*04:20.140- 04:21.800* :  which was to have led that mission.
*04:22.300- 04:26.100* :  I heard the latest from our Central America and Caribbean correspondent, Will Grott.
*04:26.500- 04:31.180* :  Well, I'm in Dachabon, which is right on the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti,
*04:31.180- 04:34.440* :  and the border is now very, very firmly closed.
*04:34.680- 04:40.380* :  There has been some movement during the day, but part of that movement is the deportation
*04:40.520- 04:43.540* :  of undocumented Haitian migrants back to Haiti.
*04:43.540- 04:47.420* :  Back to a country that's in the grip of the worst humanitarian crisis.
*04:47.420- 04:50.420* :  It's experienced since the 2010 quake.
*04:50.680- 04:54.400* :  There has been some movement in the other direction at some point during the day,
*04:54.720- 04:55.640* :  but we didn't see any.
*04:55.640- 05:00.480* :  We saw troops turning people away, but we can tell that and we've spoken to people who say that
*05:00.480- 05:02.740* :  they were able to come over in the morning just to get supplies.
*05:02.760- 05:07.740* :  There's a sort of commercial area around the border where they were able to go to,
*05:07.740- 05:10.560* :  but not as it were into the Dominican Republic proper.
*05:11.640- 05:16.100* :  And in the capital itself where the picture remains much the same, extremely violent,
*05:16.180- 05:19.540* :  extremely dangerous, and largely controlled by the gangs.
*05:20.260- 05:24.100* :  And yet, after the resignation of the Prime Minister, Aurel Enri,
*05:24.520- 05:29.060* :  the U.S. State Department says it expects a transitional council in Haiti to be appointed
*05:29.060- 05:32.720* :  within the next couple of days, and then they will nominate a new Prime Minister.
*05:33.060- 05:35.200* :  It seems hard to see how that is possible.
*05:35.200- 05:36.260* :  Who do you deal with?
*05:36.540- 05:37.460* :  How does it come about?
*05:38.120- 05:43.040* :  Yeah, they've talked about the fact that they're in touch and they've held meetings
*05:43.040- 05:47.760* :  with different stakeholders, as they put it, from members of the church to different political
*05:47.760- 05:50.160* :  factions to civil society.
*05:50.160- 05:54.000* :  But I think that kind of timeframe seems extremely ambitious.
*05:54.580- 05:57.940* :  In part, I think it was said with that kind of thinking,
*05:58.280- 06:02.720* :  because there was expectation or certainly hopes that an international force
*06:02.760- 06:05.780* :  have led by Kenyan personnel around a thousand Kenyan personnel,
*06:06.360- 06:10.480* :  a forced tackle the gangs might be in place quite soon.
*06:10.480- 06:15.040* :  But we've also seen that the Kenyan government has poured cold water on that happening
*06:15.520- 06:19.500* :  without a sitting administration, even if it's a transitional one.
*06:19.500- 06:23.060* :  So the whole situation remains very, very up in the air.
*06:23.060- 06:26.900* :  It really is a sense of political limbo, a political vacuum,
*06:26.900- 06:29.600* :  really, that these people are being deported back into.
*06:29.980- 06:34.820* :  And Will, Haiti has seen so much instability over the last 30 years in particular,
*06:34.820- 06:37.660* :  an assassination recently of one president,
*06:38.080- 06:42.060* :  another ousted a couple of times in the 90s and early 2000s.
*06:42.320- 06:48.740* :  Do you think the situation right now is worse than it has ever been in the last few decades?
*06:49.300- 06:52.920* :  The things I can't remember a degree of anarchy that was quite as this bad.
*06:52.920- 06:59.240* :  I mean, obviously there was real serious horrendous humanitarian need after the earthquake.
*06:59.780- 07:04.100* :  And of course, widespread looting, homelessness, really, really dark days.
*07:04.100- 07:06.540* :  It's important not to forget how bad that period was.
*07:07.120- 07:10.580* :  But I think this sense of gang rule is the bit that I can't remember,
*07:10.580- 07:13.300* :  the bit that the sort of complete absence of the state.
*07:13.300- 07:19.260* :  And the fact that the gangs dominate the capital by such a large extent,
*07:19.260- 07:23.760* :  that police are being outnumbered and are losing all motivation,
*07:23.760- 07:27.480* :  perhaps even fleeing with her reports of that at some, in some cases.
*07:28.000- 07:29.660* :  Looting is hard to keep under control.
*07:30.400- 07:30.900* :  Will Grant.
*07:30.900- 07:36.020* :  Well, for more on the pressing humanitarian crisis, Tim Frank spoke to Jean-Marc Tambour,
*07:36.560- 07:39.100* :  the Haiti Country Director for the World Food Programme.
*07:39.360- 07:41.780* :  He's currently in the second city, Cap Aisia.
*07:42.360- 07:47.240* :  Right now in Porter Prince, the World Food Programme is able to provide some response to the crisis.
*07:47.320- 07:51.040* :  Now, the crisis in Porter Prince has caused thousands of people to leave their homes.
*07:51.520- 07:55.940* :  Overall in Haiti, there are 362,000 internally displaced people.
*07:55.940- 08:00.960* :  Over the past weekend, about 15,000 new displaced people were identified.
*08:01.180- 08:05.420* :  Their homes are burned and they leave with a little more than the clothes on their back.
*08:05.500- 08:09.960* :  And what we at the World Food Programme have been doing is we've been running a Hot Meals program.
*08:09.960- 08:12.800* :  We've been scaling it from about 7,000 meals a day.
*08:12.800- 08:14.480* :  We've reached 12,000 meals a day.
*08:14.480- 08:19.640* :  We'd like to get to 20,000 meals per day as soon as secured in access conditions allow.
*08:19.980- 08:22.760* :  We've also done dry rations, invulnerable parts of Porter Prince.
*08:22.760- 08:25.620* :  Some neighborhoods have been under gang influence for years.
*08:25.620- 08:30.300* :  And the day before yesterday, we were able to provide food rations to 4,000 people and see they so late.
*08:30.460- 08:32.260* :  I'm sure that you're doing all that you can.
*08:32.260- 08:37.420* :  Can you nonetheless give me some sense of how far you think it is meeting the need,
*08:37.420- 08:39.760* :  how far you think it may be, falling short?
*08:40.560- 08:43.820* :  The needs are quite high and what we need is security.
*08:44.160- 08:44.940* :  We need access.
*08:45.120- 08:46.520* :  We need the shooting to stop.
*08:46.860- 08:50.340* :  We need to be able to get to every single neighborhood in Porter Prince.
*08:50.620- 08:55.940* :  What we're doing right now is helpful, but it's short of the need because of the fact that we have
*08:55.940- 08:57.440* :  a very constrained environment.
*08:57.820- 09:00.360* :  Are you able to get any supplies in at the moment?
*09:00.420- 09:05.300* :  For a long time, the gangs, they were in control of a lot of access points.
*09:05.300- 09:09.120* :  But I mean, it seems as if they're in control completely now.
*09:10.200- 09:15.180* :  But what we're doing in Porter Prince is being run off stocks that we hold.
*09:15.180- 09:17.580* :  So we still have stocks for some time.
*09:17.620- 09:20.540* :  And we would be able to scale the response temporarily.
*09:20.640- 09:24.240* :  The problem is we cannot renew and replenish these stocks.
*09:24.240- 09:27.640* :  The port was looted just a few days ago.
*09:27.640- 09:33.420* :  The road access to Porter Prince is very dangerous because armed groups control the major roads
*09:33.420- 09:36.880* :  in and out of Porter Prince and the international airport is closed.
*09:36.880- 09:40.440* :  We're right now running a response on the basis of the stocks that we hold.
*09:40.440- 09:42.320* :  We're going to need to replenish fairly soon.
*09:42.320- 09:47.920* :  What I'm worried about is that Porter Prince is a city where you've got 1.6 million people
*09:47.920- 09:52.260* :  who are already facing a food crisis and supplies are running out.
*09:52.260- 09:53.800* :  We're seeing food prices rise.
*09:53.800- 09:56.640* :  We're seeing very basic items run out.
*09:56.980- 10:01.300* :  And that means that needs might outpace or ability to respond to them.
*10:01.760- 10:04.820* :  You said we may run out of stocks fairly soon.
*10:04.820- 10:09.920* :  And I realize it's in precise in the sense that it's contingent on lots of other things.
*10:09.920- 10:12.420* :  But when you say fairly soon, what are you talking about?
*10:12.640- 10:13.860* :  Days, weeks, months?
*10:13.860- 10:18.860* :  What I'm talking about is the fact that Haiti is extremely dependent on food imports.
*10:19.460- 10:21.100* :  The statement wasn't really about WFT,
*10:21.100- 10:23.760* :  but it's about how the food system works in Porter Prince.
*10:23.760- 10:24.680* :  It's a big city.
*10:24.680- 10:29.420* :  Even in the best times Haiti depends on food imports for half of the food it consumes.
*10:29.880- 10:30.860* :  It's a matter of days.
*10:31.220- 10:33.420* :  The situation has already lasted for more than a week.
*10:33.960- 10:35.040* :  We need the port to reopen.
*10:35.040- 10:39.300* :  We need a trade to resume in order to bring in fresh supplies into Porter Prince.
*10:39.680- 10:41.940* :  The neighborhood of Citesolay, by the sea,
*10:41.940- 10:44.960* :  faced about a year ago a brush with famine.
*10:45.120- 10:49.540* :  20,000 people in Citesolay were identified as facing famine-like conditions.
*10:49.540- 10:53.140* :  And it shows how close we are to a disaster in Porter Prince.
*10:53.640- 10:57.820* :  That was Jean-Marth Ann Bauer, Haiti Country Director for the World Food Programme.
*10:58.200- 11:03.700* :  The White House National Security Advisor has announced $300 million in aid for Ukraine
*11:03.700- 11:09.220* :  as a stopgap measure, while a much larger package remains stalled in Congress.
*11:09.600- 11:13.460* :  Jake Sullivan said it would help with pressing needs, including artillery routes.
*11:14.180- 11:15.660* :  But as the announcement came with a warning.
*11:16.300- 11:19.980* :  This ammunition will keep Ukraine's guns firing for a period,
*11:20.640- 11:21.900* :  but only a short period.
*11:21.900- 11:25.600* :  It is nowhere near enough to meet Ukraine's battlefield needs,
*11:25.600- 11:30.200* :  and it will not prevent Ukraine from running out of ammunition in the weeks to come.
*11:30.260- 11:33.300* :  It goes without saying this package does not
*11:33.300- 11:40.480* :  displace and should not delay the critical need to pass the bipartisan national security bill.
*11:41.080- 11:44.240* :  Jake Sullivan, meanwhile pro-Ukrainian fighters,
*11:44.640- 11:49.260* :  say they still hold Russian villages after a series of cross-border incursions.
*11:49.600- 11:53.300* :  But Moscow says their attacks were repulsed after hours of fighting.
*11:53.780- 11:56.420* :  Neither claim can be verified, but Russia has acknowledged
*11:56.420- 12:01.120* :  there had been at least seven heavily armed assaults on Russian territory.
*12:01.120- 12:02.820* :  Ristopiko reports.
*12:03.240- 12:06.340* :  Kiev says the incursions were carried out by the three Russia Legion,
*12:06.340- 12:09.240* :  Russian volunteers fighting alongside Ukrainians.
*12:09.580- 12:13.700* :  They appear to be supported by tanks and say that after clashes with Moscow's forces,
*12:13.700- 12:16.420* :  they've taken control of villages in the border region.
*12:16.740- 12:19.520* :  The Kremlin has denied this, but at the same time,
*12:19.520- 12:23.740* :  schools in Gorsk, some 50 kilometers into Russian territory, have been closed.
*12:24.380- 12:26.520* :  Similar incursions have taken place in the past,
*12:26.520- 12:28.580* :  but they haven't had a lasting impact.
*12:28.580- 12:32.960* :  They are probably best seen as Ukrainian efforts to destabilize Moscow
*12:32.960- 12:37.300* :  through asymmetrical warfare, just like the widespread drone strikes overnight.
*12:37.880- 12:38.680* :  Ristopiko.
*12:39.340- 12:45.320* :  The EU's foreign policy chief has said starvation is being used as an arm of war in Gaza.
*12:46.140- 12:51.640* :  Joseph Borrell described the lack of aid entering the territory as a man-made disaster.
*12:52.220- 12:57.820* :  Earlier, the British Foreign Secretary David Cameron urged Israel to open one of its main cargo
*12:57.820- 13:01.320* :  ports to seaborn aid deliveries destined for Gaza,
*13:01.320- 13:06.040* :  amid warnings of an impending famine, and he said even more measures were needed.
*13:06.500- 13:09.200* :  Israel must open more land routes, including in the north,
*13:09.200- 13:11.580* :  for longer and with fewer screening requirements.
*13:11.580- 13:14.880* :  I've been clear, we need an immediate humanitarian pause
*13:14.880- 13:18.060* :  to increase aid into Gaza and get the hostages out.
*13:18.060- 13:23.220* :  Israel must remove restrictions on aid and restore electricity, water and telephone locations.
*13:23.820- 13:28.540* :  UN officials have welcomed the opening of a new maritime aid corridor
*13:28.540- 13:32.360* :  being used by a Spanish ship, which has left Cyprus for Gaza,
*13:32.360- 13:34.180* :  but say it's nowhere near enough.
*13:34.720- 13:37.180* :  I heard more from Mark Lowen, our correspondent in Jerusalem.
*13:37.680- 13:40.460* :  What we know is that this ship has left Cyprus.
*13:40.460- 13:43.100* :  It's going slowly, three knots an hour.
*13:43.360- 13:48.340* :  We know, first of all, that it is carrying rice, flour, protein,
*13:49.120- 13:54.100* :  beans, meat, apparently, and this is from an American aid organization called World Central Kitchen.
*13:54.720- 13:58.900* :  It's been carried on a boat belonging to the Spanish NGO Open Arms.
*13:59.580- 14:00.860* :  It is bound for Gaza.
*14:00.860- 14:03.420* :  Now, where does it actually go and how does it offload?
*14:03.740- 14:08.320* :  What is happening at the moment is that there are some teams from the NGO
*14:08.320- 14:14.420* :  building a jetty somewhere off the gas and coast for the ship to dock.
*14:15.380- 14:19.400* :  Now, the jetty has been built with rubble from some of the destroyed buildings over the last five
*14:19.400- 14:26.440* :  months of war. The longer-term plan, which is a separate mission, is that the Americans are
*14:26.440- 14:32.700* :  sending another ship to build a more permanent pier, which aid ships would be able to dock at,
*14:33.360- 14:39.960* :  and then a causeway which smaller ships would be able to come to in order to take the aid from
*14:39.960- 14:45.420* :  the larger aid ships and then basically take that to land and then vehicles would drive it into
*14:45.420- 14:51.640* :  Gaza. But there are a huge number of questions over who would provide the security with those
*14:51.640- 14:57.800* :  vehicles going into Gaza. When aid, much needed aid is distributed to starving desperate people,
*14:58.440- 14:59.280* :  it's not a simple process.
*14:59.540- 15:04.360* :  So, Mark, it sounds the same from what you're saying with regards to the security of aid
*15:04.360- 15:10.180* :  deliveries, regardless of how the aid gets in by sea or by land. That is key, isn't it?
*15:11.040- 15:16.080* :  It is, yeah, Nick. I mean, this is a territory that is in its sixth month of war,
*15:16.760- 15:20.340* :  where not only have a 80% of the population been displaced,
*15:21.220- 15:24.000* :  tens of thousands of people killed, according to local health officials,
*15:24.620- 15:28.420* :  but there are no local structures in place, really, in vast parts of the territory.
*15:28.420- 15:33.000* :  So, the police force in northern Gaza, for example, it's just not present.
*15:33.600- 15:38.100* :  So, the northern part of Gaza, which is the most desperately in need of aid,
*15:38.100- 15:44.940* :  where gas and health officials are saying that at least 25 children have now died from famine
*15:44.940- 15:49.720* :  and dehydration. There are just no structures in place there, really, to distribute the aid,
*15:50.000- 15:53.660* :  which is why you saw those tragic scenes a couple of weeks ago, the Stampede,
*15:53.660- 15:58.020* :  Palestinian saying that Israelis shot at them, the Israeli saying that actually it was a mob
*15:58.020- 16:02.780* :  that was kind of run over by aid trucks and stuff. So, it's a huge, huge challenge.
*16:02.780- 16:10.260* :  That was Mark Loen. The Barundian sports team Dynamo is out of the basketball Africa League,
*16:10.300- 16:15.720* :  not for its lack of skill on the court, but because of the row over the logos on the team shirts,
*16:16.400- 16:21.240* :  Rwanda sponsors the league, and that's turned a sports story into one with deeply political
*16:21.240- 16:25.300* :  overtones. I heard more from Will Ross, our Africa regional editor.
*16:25.580- 16:30.460* :  The shirts of this team Dynamo, who were playing in this basketball tournament in South Africa,
*16:31.060- 16:36.140* :  had the logo on them of Visit Rwanda, as all the other teams did in the tournament,
*16:36.940- 16:42.240* :  but for the game on Saturday, when they played against a team from Cape Town, the Cape Town Tigers,
*16:42.240- 16:50.280* :  this Barundian team decided to cover up the Visit Rwanda logo, and for that, they received a two-match
*16:50.280- 16:55.640* :  suspension, and then it transpires that under the rules, if you're suspended for two games within
*16:55.640- 17:01.220* :  the same tournament, you're then not allowed to continue. So, the team has to now travel home,
*17:01.220- 17:08.660* :  and this is really all about a long-running row between Barundian Rwanda. People may know this
*17:08.940- 17:14.040* :  Visit Rwanda slogan. It's something that the Arsenal football team have on the sleeves of their
*17:14.040- 17:20.700* :  shirts, which has been a slightly controversial sponsorship deal. In this case, Rwanda has
*17:20.700- 17:27.880* :  kind of been at the forefront of promoting basketball in Africa, and Barundi has accused Rwanda
*17:27.880- 17:34.460* :  of supporting rebels that have carried out attacks inside Barundi, something that Kigali denies,
*17:35.060- 17:41.060* :  so it looks like a kind of political maneuver by Barundi in order to perhaps raise some attention
*17:41.060- 17:45.800* :  about this problem they have with Rwanda, because presumably they would have known going into the
*17:45.800- 17:50.620* :  tournament that these were the shirts, this is what you've got to wear. Yeah, it's interesting that
*17:51.220- 17:57.480* :  you're reading perhaps into it motives from Barundi to make a political statement.
*17:58.140- 18:03.740* :  There's obviously some frustration at all of this, because as the Dynamo's American player,
*18:03.740- 18:09.520* :  Brighton Hobb said, it was pretty clear that there would have been contracts involved. This
*18:09.520- 18:14.380* :  wasn't a sudden punishment imposed without Barundi kind of knowing what they're doing, and he
*18:14.380- 18:20.020* :  suggested that actually the Barundian government had told the team to do this. So yes, it once again
*18:20.020- 18:25.060* :  highlights the tension in the Great Lakes region, and it's all come to the surface at this basketball
*18:25.060- 18:34.740* :  tournament. Will Ross? Still to come. France is a largest consumer of frogs legs, and we import
*18:34.780- 18:41.760* :  about 3,000 tons every year. Now this famous French dish is attracting controversy.
*18:47.600- 18:52.400* :  Hi, I'm Sophia Smith-Gayler, and I'm Sachi Cole. I'm with a host of a brand new podcast from the
*18:52.400- 18:58.920* :  BBC World Service, where to be a woman. So what's the podcast about Sachi? It's all about where
*18:58.920- 19:02.700* :  in the world women are living their best lives, where female wellness looks like globally,
*19:02.700- 19:06.220* :  and what the rest of us may be able to learn from it, and where can people find it?
*19:06.380- 19:09.660* :  Just search for where to be a woman wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*19:10.280- 19:12.820* :  And follow a subscribe so you never miss an episode.
*19:19.980- 19:26.300* :  After Openheimer's success at the Oscars, why not delve into the history of the atomic bomb and
*19:26.300- 19:32.740* :  key characters from that period of history with a podcast? The bomb from the BBC World Service
*19:32.740- 19:38.640* :  explores the race to beat the Nazis in developing the atomic bomb and the scientists and spies
*19:38.640- 19:45.320* :  who changed history. Listen to the whole series now by searching for the bomb wherever you get to your
*19:52.600- 19:56.560* :  BBC podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The U.S. Special Council,
*19:56.560- 20:01.740* :  who released a skating report last month, suggesting President Biden had a poor memory,
*20:01.740- 20:07.580* :  has been getting testimony at a congressional hearing. Robert Herr, originally a Republican
*20:07.580- 20:13.820* :  appointee, defended his report after Mr. Biden criticized his findings. Mr. Herr was investigating
*20:13.820- 20:19.440* :  classified documents found at the president's home. He said Mr. Biden appeared to have no memory
*20:19.440- 20:24.180* :  of how they got there. Testifying before the hearing, Mr. Herr said he was simply doing his job.
*20:44.520- 20:50.180* :  I explained to the Attorney General my decision and the reason for it, that's what I was required to do.
*20:50.760- 20:55.880* :  Our Washington correspondent, Nomi Iqbal, was on Capitol Hill where she listened to the congressional
*20:55.940- 21:02.240* :  hearing. Special prosecutor Robert Herr finds himself a rare unifying figure. Republicans and
*21:02.240- 21:08.420* :  Democrats are angry with him. Republicans wanted him to charge Mr. Biden and Democrats are furious
*21:08.420- 21:13.400* :  over how he made the president's age and cognitive abilities a weak point with voters
*21:13.400- 21:19.540* :  of focus in his report. They have accused Mr. Herr of being passers-an, a claim made at the hearing
*21:19.540- 21:24.860* :  by the Democrat congressman, Hank Johnson. You are a Republican, no aren't you? I am a registered
*21:24.860- 21:30.260* :  Republican. And you're doing everything you can do to get President Trump reelected so that you
*21:30.260- 21:35.660* :  can get appointed as a federal judge or perhaps to another position in the Department of Justice,
*21:36.220- 21:42.080* :  Congressman, I have no such aspirations. I can assure you partisan politics had no place whatsoever
*21:42.080- 21:47.240* :  in my work. Republicans are looking for evidence that Mr. Herr was under political pressure not to
*21:47.240- 21:51.940* :  charge the president, claiming that the case is similar to the classified documents prosecution
*21:51.940- 21:57.900* :  Donald Trump is facing. Mr. Herr said his investigations findings did not meet the bar for
*21:57.900- 22:04.140* :  criminal prosecution and he could not determine whether Mr. Biden had willfully retained a disclosed
*22:04.140- 22:08.320* :  sensitive documents without addressing the president's state of mind.
*22:08.320- 22:14.460* :  Nommie Igbel in Washington, Iraq's agriculture ministry says half of the country's farmland
*22:14.460- 22:20.800* :  has now been abandoned due to an ongoing drought. The UN has ranked Iraq as one of the country's
*22:20.800- 22:25.700* :  worst affected by climate change. Here's Mike Thompson. Many Middle Eastern countries are suffering
*22:25.700- 22:31.960* :  from droughts but few as badly as Iraq. rainfall there is at its lowest in 40 years,
*22:31.960- 22:38.300* :  leaving vast sways of agricultural land parched and useless. Last year, the country's president
*22:38.300- 22:44.240* :  Mohamed Shia Al-Sadani said climate change was affecting more than seven million Iraqis.
*22:44.720- 22:50.580* :  Much of Iraq's water comes from the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, both originate in Turkey,
*22:50.580- 22:56.720* :  which has built dozens of dams along them, reducing flow to already water-stabbed Iraq.
*22:57.660- 23:01.760* :  Mike Thompson. China's largest producer of bottled water,
*23:01.760- 23:07.360* :  Nongfu Spring, has come under attack for not being patriotic enough. The company has been
*23:07.360- 23:13.520* :  criticized for its packaging looking to Japanese and there's also a tale of a rivalry with another
*23:13.520- 23:19.020* :  bottled water company. Some have started to boycott Nongfu Spring's products and shares in the
*23:19.020- 23:23.840* :  company have fallen. I heard more from our Asia Pacific editor, Mickey Bristol. The
*23:23.840- 23:30.200* :  attack on Nongfu Spring appears to have started last month when a rival bottled water company,
*23:30.200- 23:35.800* :  the owner of that company died. Now he was very well respected. He was respected primarily for
*23:35.800- 23:42.880* :  being a patriot. He loved China and since then people have compared him to the owner of Nongfu
*23:42.880- 23:48.260* :  Spring. The owner of Nongfu Spring, by the way, is China's richest man, Zhong Shan Shan worth
*23:48.260- 23:54.880* :  about 60 billion dollars. A couple of things that they've pointed out, one that the owner's son
*23:54.880- 24:02.260* :  appears to have a US citizenship. So that's not really patriotic. Also some of the packaging people
*24:02.300- 24:08.940* :  have pointed out appears to be Japanese inspired. Some of the temples, which appears on the packaging,
*24:08.940- 24:16.460* :  looks like Japanese temples not Chinese temples. And as lots of people must now be aware, China
*24:16.460- 24:22.960* :  doesn't always like Japan. And so that's seen as unpatriotic as well. So it doesn't seem really
*24:22.960- 24:27.020* :  logical. It doesn't seem as though there's a great deal behind this. But when you get this national
*24:27.020- 24:32.920* :  sentiment moving, not much does need to be behind it for all these people to come across and start
*24:32.920- 24:39.240* :  criticising. What's the company itself had to say about this? Quite early on, Zhong Shan Shan
*24:39.240- 24:45.520* :  himself came out because one of the criticisms was that he'd try to undermine his rival when
*24:45.960- 24:50.340* :  his rival was still alive. He came out to Zhong Shan Shan and said, no, that's not the case.
*24:50.720- 24:55.520* :  I respected him. We were both in a competitive business. We both fought hard, but we respected
*24:55.520- 25:02.040* :  each other. So he's tried to new to this campaign against his company. The provincial government
*25:02.040- 25:07.620* :  where his company's base has also said, look, this is really silly to try and attack one of our
*25:07.620- 25:12.300* :  great companies. So they've tried to stop it as well. But at the moment, they haven't had much
*25:12.540- 25:17.420* :  success. Has this kind of thing happened in the past? Companies being attacked for allegedly not
*25:17.420- 25:23.100* :  being nationalist. It happens all the time in China. I have to say it's usually foreign companies,
*25:23.100- 25:29.480* :  perhaps they've listed, for example, Taiwan as an independent country on their website. Taiwan,
*25:29.480- 25:37.200* :  the Chinese believe is part of their own territory. Or perhaps a country is subject to a political
*25:37.200- 25:42.920* :  campaign by the government in China. Companies from that country will be attacked. So it happens
*25:42.920- 25:49.460* :  all the time. Not as often is it directed against a Chinese company, the speed with which this has
*25:49.460- 25:54.840* :  happened shows that it can happen. At lightning pace, it isn't always logical, but it can cause
*25:54.840- 26:02.360* :  immense damage to your company. Next to France, where frogs legs have been part of the national
*26:02.360- 26:07.480* :  diet for more than a thousand years. Now, though, this famous French dish is attracting controversy.
*26:08.020- 26:12.920* :  Wildlife groups are complaining that the thousands of frozen frog legs, which France imports,
*26:12.920- 26:19.080* :  is leading some species to decline. More than 500 scientists have written a letter to the French
*26:19.080- 26:25.100* :  president, Emmanuel Macron, to in their words, end the over-exploitation of these amphibious creatures.
*26:32.800- 26:39.620* :  Who is one of those leading the call to protect frogs? France is the largest consumer of frogs legs,
*26:39.620- 26:47.840* :  and we import about 3,000 tons every year, and these frogs are mainly coming from Indonesia,
*26:47.840- 26:59.600* :  Turkey and Albania. 3,000 tons, it represents about 60 to 150 million frogs, depending on their size.
*27:00.180- 27:06.440* :  So presumably, that's far more than the number of frogs in France. Is that why they're imported?
*27:07.020- 27:15.440* :  They are imported because capturing frogs in France is prohibited, mainly frog species in Europe
*27:15.480- 27:21.780* :  and in France are protected, and that's why the market switched to imports when frogs have been
*27:21.780- 27:29.520* :  protected in France. We imported them from India and Bangladesh, and these two countries banned
*27:29.520- 27:38.140* :  at the end of the 80s the export because they witnessed that the over-exploitation of frogs was
*27:38.140- 27:45.620* :  causing a collapse of frogs population, and also some invasion of mosquitoes and crop pests,
*27:45.680- 27:54.520* :  and then an increase of use of pesticides. So then the market switched to Indonesia, Turkey and Albania.
*27:54.740- 28:01.020* :  Yes, and what do you say, and what do the other wildlife groups say that has done to frog populations
*28:01.020- 28:07.360* :  in those countries? Stay by steps, there is a domino effect. The hunters are targeting one species
*28:07.360- 28:13.940* :  for its huge legs, and then this species is disappearing, and then another species is target,
*28:14.480- 28:19.900* :  and then another country is target, another area is target. And step by step, we witness a
*28:19.900- 28:26.140* :  significant decline of this population, and it has viewed ecological effect because frogs are
*28:26.140- 28:32.940* :  natural insects, controllers, they eat a lot of mosquitoes, and it has impact on the use of
*28:32.940- 28:39.900* :  pesticides, etc. So that's why frogs are helpers for humanity, and we should protect them and not
*28:40.580- 28:45.900* :  and what are you calling on President Macron to do? We are calling him to take France's responsibility
*28:45.920- 28:53.680* :  and to initiate protection of the most traded frogs species. We think that France should
*28:53.680- 29:00.260* :  take the lead and should draft some proposal in order at least to control the trade because
*29:00.260- 29:06.980* :  nowhere there is totally out of control. And how are people in France reacting to this? Because
*29:07.020- 29:13.900* :  we outside the country have always associated frogs legs as a famous part of French cuisine.
*29:13.900- 29:20.160* :  Is it still very popular? So it's still popular, less and less, but unfortunately it's still
*29:20.160- 29:26.140* :  popular, but what we know is that people totally lack of information. They are astonished when we
*29:26.140- 29:32.300* :  inform them about where the frogs are coming from. They are totally surprised when we inform
*29:32.300- 29:38.900* :  them that it comes from Indonesia, etc. So there is a lack of information, so that's why also we
*29:39.080- 29:45.880* :  with scientists and other NGOs, we are campaigning in order to inform the consumers about what they are
*29:45.880- 29:52.360* :  doing. We know that the market is less and less popular, but unfortunately it's still popular
*29:52.360- 30:00.900* :  because some people try to push the nostalgia of frogs legs and to create some new events with
*30:01.660- 30:09.100* :  frogs legs on the plate and some festival of frogs legs. Some people are trying to
*30:09.100- 30:16.480* :  re-vigorate this trade. Charlotte Nitha from the French NGO Robert de Bois. We're often told
*30:16.480- 30:22.780* :  that in order to be happy we must look inwards usually under the banner of self-care, but a new
*30:22.780- 30:28.420* :  study suggests amongst other things that maybe we should be looking outwards. The study which
*30:28.420- 30:33.800* :  followed 230 people over two years also came up with a list of things almost guaranteed to improve
*30:33.800- 30:39.780* :  our mood. Stephanie Prentice has been reading it. I'll start. Why should we pay attention to this study?
*30:40.280- 30:44.300* :  Well Nick, you're absolutely not wrong. We do hear a lot about happiness from the wellness
*30:44.300- 30:49.580* :  industry, from the neuroscience community and from these sort of studies that combine the two.
*30:50.080- 30:54.980* :  Given the sometimes ephemeral nature of feeling happy, it can be harder to turn those learnings
*30:54.980- 31:00.240* :  into practical behaviours, but that's what the study set out to do. It's evidence-based,
*31:00.240- 31:06.100* :  it's out of Bristol University in southern England and it runs a 10-week course where students
*31:06.100- 31:11.000* :  build daily habits. The rather than will have seen celebrated already on social media like
*31:11.000- 31:17.220* :  getting outside in nature, expressing gratitude, meditating, journaling, but perhaps unsurprisingly
*31:17.220- 31:22.560* :  the students they asked two years later who still practice those habits daily, they reported
*31:23.100- 31:29.220* :  being 10-15% happier. And while that might seem obvious that there would be, there were other
*31:29.520- 31:36.380* :  less obvious findings. That we should have chocolate cake or anything like that on a daily basis.
*31:36.640- 31:41.020* :  I mean we absolutely should, that can't be argued with, but actually let's take a quick listen
*31:41.020- 31:46.080* :  to the man who led the study. His name is Bruce Hood, he's a professor, and the author of the book
*31:46.080- 31:51.740* :  The Science of Happiness. The biggest problem I think in the happiness industry is that we've been
*31:51.740- 31:55.520* :  getting the wrong message. People have been told to look after themselves and focus on themselves,
*31:55.520- 31:59.240* :  but that's exactly the wrong thing you should be doing. You should be trying to share your joy
*31:59.240- 32:02.700* :  and connect with other people. You know, just generally connecting with other people is really the
*32:02.700- 32:08.680* :  root to happiness. He also says, be less selfish, focus on helping others, and if we just rattles
*32:08.680- 32:13.880* :  through the list, he can part from his findings, it says talk to strangers, give people gifts,
*32:13.880- 32:19.380* :  apparently that activates more reward centres than buying something for yourself, and as an adjacent
*32:19.380- 32:23.840* :  point to that, he says loneliness impacts physical health because it impairs our immune systems,
*32:24.580- 32:28.760* :  regular activities that provide connection like joining a choir or a sports team are also
*32:29.280- 32:33.720* :  recommended, sleep is critical to happiness levels, perhaps the most surprising is social media.
*32:33.720- 32:38.860* :  Now we often see that link to negative mental health. It's not bad for everyone the study says,
*32:38.860- 32:44.300* :  just those who you guessed it, focus on themselves, and critically he said happiness
*32:44.300- 32:48.980* :  means it's like going to the gym, you've got to do it regularly to see those good results.
*32:49.540- 32:50.540* :  Stephanie Prentice.
*32:52.700- 32:56.580* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*33:28.940- 33:34.660* :  going? Well, I know it's all of those subscriptions. I used rocket money to help me find out what
*33:34.660- 33:39.060* :  subscriptions I'm actually spending money on and I had them cancel the ones I didn't want anymore.
*33:39.060- 33:43.680* :  Rocket money is a personal finance app that finds and cancels your unwanted subscriptions,
