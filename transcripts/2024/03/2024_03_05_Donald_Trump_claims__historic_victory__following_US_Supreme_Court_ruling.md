*00:00.620- 00:03.800* :  Hi, Namulanta Combo here with some very exciting news.
*00:04.280- 00:06.480* :  Dear daughter is back for a new series.
*00:07.000- 00:09.940* :  I'm putting together a handbook to life for daughters everywhere.
*00:10.420- 00:12.640* :  Full of stories and advice to help navigate life.
*00:13.180- 00:16.100* :  That's Dear daughter from the BBC World Service.
*00:16.560- 00:18.700* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*00:21.200- 00:24.620* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:27.700- 00:31.040* :  I'm Rachel Wright and the early hours of Tuesday the 5th of March.
*00:31.040- 00:32.500* :  These are our main stories.
*00:32.940- 00:38.340* :  The US Supreme Court rules Donald Trump will appear on the presidential primary ballot in Colorado.
*00:38.340- 00:41.160* :  He's described it as a historic victory.
*00:41.800- 00:49.320* :  Ghana's Finance Minister warns new anti-Gay laws could put the country at risk of losing billions of dollars in economic aid.
*00:49.860- 00:56.780* :  And we hear from teenagers in Ukraine who were determined not to miss out on their school prom, even in the middle of a war.
*00:59.800- 01:06.000* :  Also in this podcast, a Ferrari stolen from a Formula 1 driver 30 years ago has been found.
*01:06.560- 01:07.180* :  And...
*01:07.500- 01:09.400* :  Happy Birthday to you.
*01:10.280- 01:13.480* :  Happy Birthday to you.
*01:16.880- 01:18.080* :  Happy Birthday to you.
*01:18.280- 01:19.440* :  Well, Happy Birthday.
*01:19.500- 01:23.260* :  The famous song turns 100 years old. Or does it?
*01:28.100- 01:32.380* :  The former president Donald Trump has called it a historic win for America.
*01:32.380- 01:39.040* :  And the justices from the US Supreme Court have gone out of their way to say that they were unified and unanimous.
*01:39.420- 01:51.220* :  Their decision that the former president should remain on Colorado's primary ballot, overruling the state's decision to disqualify Mr. Trump for his part in the January 6th attack on the Capitol.
*01:51.860- 01:54.620* :  Similar attempts have been made in Illinois and Maine.
*01:54.620- 01:59.700* :  Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Mr. Trump called it a great day for liberty.
*02:00.120- 02:04.780* :  They can go after me as a politician. They can go after me with votes.
*02:05.840- 02:09.220* :  But they're not going to go after me with that kind of lawsuit.
*02:10.080- 02:14.360* :  It's been weaponized like it's never been. This is for third world countries. This isn't for us.
*02:15.480- 02:19.900* :  Eric Olsen is one of the lawyers representing Colorado voters in the case.
*02:20.960- 02:29.480* :  Nothing in the opinion has doubt on the findings by every court to look at this issue that Donald Trump engaged in insurrection leading up to on January 6th.
*02:30.080- 02:33.420* :  We're confident that that will be important to many voters at the ballot box.
*02:33.800- 02:37.260* :  But yes, we will respect the decision today and look forward to moving forward.
*02:37.800- 02:41.860* :  Earlier, I spoke to the BBC's North America correspondent, Nomiya Ikbal.
*02:42.260- 02:52.880* :  Well, the Supreme Court justices indicated in the oral arguments last month that they weren't convinced that this post civil war amendment constitutions,
*02:52.880- 03:01.740* :  which was 14th Amendment Section 3, was valid in terms of what these voters, these Colorado voters that had brought this case,
*03:01.860- 03:03.680* :  and that included Republican voters I should add.
*03:04.280- 03:14.020* :  The Chief Justice Roberts had said that the whole point of the 14th Amendment was, which was aimed at preventing former Confederates from returning to power in the U.S.
*03:14.380- 03:18.780* :  if they engage in insurrection, was to restrict state power.
*03:18.780- 03:26.040* :  So why would you therefore allow a state to have the power to kick a presidential candidate off the ballots?
*03:26.040- 03:32.660* :  They weren't convinced that that was the right way to go, and they said in their ruling, it's up to Congress to decide that.
*03:32.760- 03:36.220* :  And it was a unanimous decision, which I think says something.
*03:37.200- 03:40.960* :  And so it's not a surprise that they delivered this verdict today.
*03:41.680- 03:49.840* :  And it's all come one day ahead of Super Tuesday tomorrow when Mr Trump hopes to extend his lead over his rival, Nikki Haley.
*03:50.180- 03:54.060* :  Well, about 800,000 people have already voted in the Colorado Prime Minister.
*03:54.060- 03:57.520* :  That was according to the Secretary of State in Colorado over the weekend.
*03:58.160- 04:01.600* :  4 million people have received their mail-in ballot voting.
*04:02.280- 04:06.840* :  And so let's just say the Supreme Court had upheld that ruling by Colorado.
*04:07.840- 04:13.100* :  So you would have had hundreds of thousands of people who would have legitimately been able to say they've been disenfranchised.
*04:13.500- 04:15.160* :  So Donald Trump's name is still on the ballots.
*04:15.440- 04:17.460* :  It was always still on the ballot in Colorado.
*04:17.460- 04:20.120* :  So lots of people have already probably cast their vote for him.
*04:20.120- 04:28.360* :  It will now remain on the ballot as an option for Republican voters when it comes to choosing who they want as their candidate for the election.
*04:29.040- 04:30.480* :  And so people will resume as normal.
*04:30.480- 04:34.840* :  And I should also add that the other states that were looking to kick Donald Trump off the ballots,
*04:35.460- 04:41.900* :  their bid has now ended because that would have been the other sort of consequence of this extraordinary consequence
*04:42.040- 04:46.780* :  that if the ruling had been upheld, other states would have followed to kick Mr Trump off the ballot.
*04:46.780- 04:53.820* :  And some conservative states were even saying they would try and do the same to President Biden creating election chaos in a year,
*04:53.820- 04:57.240* :  which I think is safe to say there's already enough chaos.
*04:59.580- 05:05.560* :  Staying in the United States, talks have been taking place in the White House between the Vice President Kamala Harris
*05:05.960- 05:09.900* :  and Benny Gantz, an influential member of the Israeli war cabinet.
*05:10.500- 05:17.280* :  Yesterday, Ms Harris said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was a catastrophe and called for more aid to be let in.
*05:17.520- 05:19.300* :  She also called for a ceasefire.
*05:19.700- 05:26.780* :  Mr Gantz's visit has been criticised by some in Benjamin Netanyahu's government, including the Deputy Speaker of Parliament,
*05:27.140- 05:29.940* :  Hanok Milwitzki, who has been speaking to the BBC.
*05:29.940- 05:43.460* :  It seems like that he's involving his own personal politics and his dispute with Ayah Lapid over who is basically going to lead the left wing opposition in the next election.
*05:43.460- 05:45.740* :  And that's what this visit is all about.
*05:45.740- 05:51.840* :  It has nothing to do with the interests of Israel and Benny Gantz cannot make any commitments.
*05:52.860- 05:56.140* :  For more on this, I spoke to the BBC's Tom Bateman in Washington.
*05:56.720- 06:05.320* :  Very little is being given away. I think because of the politics surrounding this trip, we're not going to get lengthy readouts as they call them from the White House telling us what was discussed.
*06:05.320- 06:09.780* :  We know that basically they wanted to talk about the desperate humanitarian situation.
*06:09.980- 06:20.480* :  And we know that the US has been putting increasing pressure on Israel to not just to get aid in, but to secure it so that it can be distributed inside Gaza.
*06:20.480- 06:28.720* :  And you've got officials now talking very openly without attribution to the UN as it has done in the past about the risk of famine.
*06:29.200- 06:32.280* :  So we know that there was very substantial discussions.
*06:32.280- 06:47.000* :  But as I say, I don't think we're going to get a sort of detailed briefing about what was said to Mr Gantz because the administration is aware that this is ruffling a lot of feathers in Israel because of the politics surrounding his visit.
*06:47.160- 06:55.460* :  Well, as you say, I mean, Mr Gantz was invited and the Prime Minister of Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't. What's going on there?
*06:56.100- 07:16.200* :  And not just that Mr Netanyahu wasn't invited this time, he hasn't been invited since 15 months ago when he was reelected to lead the most ultra-nationalist right-wing government in Israel's history, which includes ministers who are from the ideological background of a party that was once prescribed as a terrorist organisation.
*07:16.200- 07:23.600* :  In the United States, President Biden has been increasingly annoyed, irritated, frustrated with Benjamin Netanyahu.
*07:23.660- 07:38.200* :  I mean, these two have a very checkered history. Mr Biden is as Democrats go as pro-Israel as they come, but he has always had problems with Mr Netanyahu in terms of their own relationship.
*07:38.200- 07:56.760* :  It's been somewhat tangled in the past. Now, given the context of what has happened, given the iron clad, as they describe it backing for Israel, that the US administration has had particularly since the October the 7th attacks, and the fact that they arm Israel militarily.
*07:56.760- 08:03.440* :  It's put a lot of pressure on Mr Biden from his Democratic base, given the catastrophe on the ground now in Gaza.
*08:04.000- 08:10.980* :  I think they feel that Mr Gantz is more ideologically aligned with their long-term policy objective of the two-state solution.
*08:11.040- 08:23.820* :  So this is a snub to Mr Netanyahu. He has reacted to this privately briefing via his aides to the Israeli media that this trip was done without his approval. He has said there is only one Prime Minister, and it's him.
*08:24.520- 08:39.660* :  Tom Bateman. The end of the school prom is a right of passage for many teenagers across the world. So much so, one group of youngsters in Ukraine were determined not to miss out, even though their school became part of a war zone.
*08:40.100- 08:52.560* :  Most of the students fled to live in other countries, but as our culture editor Katie Razzle discovered, a group of them went to extraordinary lengths to make their special day go ahead in their bombed out hometown.
*08:58.420- 09:00.920* :  My name is Julia. I am 18 years old.
*09:01.500- 09:13.600* :  My name is Andesia. I am 17 years old. My name is Sophia. I am 17 years old. I used to live in Macolive, in Ukraine. I left in February 2022.
*09:13.600- 09:23.840* :  Sophia, Aliesia, and Julia. School friends from Macolive in southern Ukraine. Three teenagers who scattered to different countries in Europe when war broke out.
*09:24.480- 09:36.020* :  I did have my family and my friends still with me, but it still felt very isolating, especially with everyone else in the world still leaving their lives like nothing happened.
*09:36.020- 09:41.660* :  They were refugees, doing online school in cramped conditions, far away from all they'd known.
*09:42.200- 09:48.300* :  How can you enjoy your life when you have all like two or three countries or go around Europe and come back to your city?
*09:48.300- 09:53.540* :  It feels like something was taken away from me and it was not fair.
*09:54.100- 10:04.480* :  But they are all still teenagers, with teenage dreams. And that dream involved holding a school prom back in Ukraine, even though their city and their school was being bombed.
*10:04.860- 10:12.440* :  I think it was very important to have that ending of our old lives, of our school lives, of our teenage years.
*10:12.880- 10:14.660* :  And Julia, why did you want to go back?
*10:14.980- 10:20.720* :  Our friend group was separated, so seeing everyone really important to all of us.
*10:20.860- 10:29.600* :  But what to wear? To save money, Sophia decided to buy her prom dress in Leviv in West Ukraine, a bus trip from Switzerland that took her nearly a day.
*10:30.040- 10:37.140* :  You went on a 20-hour bus journey to Leviv to buy dress and then you turned around and came back. That's how much this prom meant to you.
*10:37.580- 10:45.020* :  Yeah, the one was really perfect. It was like a favorite one forever. It is like gold, and it was really long.
*10:48.480- 10:53.880* :  Sophia's mom drove her to the prom. It took three days. Sophia caught some of it on her phone.
*10:54.200- 10:57.480* :  Now we have a little stop, like to have a rest or something.
*10:58.200- 11:06.020* :  It was really very hard, because my mom had to drive alone, and it's not so comfortable to sleep in the car.
*11:06.520- 11:08.480* :  Ali, I see what happened at the prom, was it fun?
*11:08.900- 11:11.180* :  It was fun, we danced together.
*11:18.020- 11:22.700* :  I was wearing long silky dress that I really liked. I felt really pretty.
*11:23.120- 11:25.980* :  And Julia, did it feel like being a normal teenager again?
*11:26.620- 11:36.160* :  Yes, it did. It was actually much more special than just being in our mood. It's in Europe because prom is quite a special day. It was kind of magical.
*11:36.820- 11:38.100* :  What are your hopes for the future?
*11:38.500- 11:43.500* :  My mom says all the time that we don't have to do plans, but we can do hopes.
*11:43.680- 11:50.600* :  So I hope I will finish the school, start the university, find it like a job and just to pay some of bills.
*11:50.600- 11:58.480* :  I hope that eventually my life will come back to normal or at least I will make it as normal as it can be.
*11:59.040- 12:05.600* :  I don't think that there is a single person whose life was not changed at all.
*12:09.600- 12:10.400* :  Katie Rossell.
*12:10.780- 12:18.460* :  A Ferrari that was stolen from an Austrian Formula One racing driver in Italy almost 30 years ago has been found in the UK.
*12:18.500- 12:27.520* :  Detectives in London recovered the Ferrari Testerossa after its maker spotted Gerhard Berger's missing car listed for sale online.
*12:27.520- 12:30.800* :  Our correspondence Sophie Long has the inside track.
*12:31.260- 12:41.200* :  The Testerossa was Ferrari's flagship model of the 1980s driven by owners including Sir Elton John, Michael Jordan and the fictional detective Crockett in NBC's Miami Vice.
*12:41.580- 12:44.440* :  Absolutely essential for any type of serious police worker.
*12:47.520- 12:57.680* :  The last time Gerhard Berger saw his red Testerossa was through the windscreen of a VW Golf he'd quickly commented to chase it through the streets in the hope of catching its thief.
*12:58.360- 13:07.180* :  The Formula One driver witnessed the robbery at the San Marino Grand Prix. His first attempt to stop it by running into its path failed as he was forced to jump out of the way.
*13:07.860- 13:15.780* :  So did his second despite finishing third on the Grand Prix podium he was unable to catch up with his car on the cobbled streets of Emola.
*13:16.500- 13:26.920* :  Nearly three decades later and the Metropolitan Police received a report from Ferrari after they carried out checks on one of the same models being sold to an American buyer through a British broker.
*13:27.700- 13:35.220* :  Officers from the organised vehicle crime unit say it was shipped to Japan shortly after it was stolen but was bought to the UK late last year.
*13:35.900- 13:48.180* :  Despite the passage of time and its unknown whereabouts the stolen car valued at around £350,000 remains in pristine condition with perfectly polished alloys and brilliant red bodywork.
*13:48.740- 13:51.420* :  It's been seized by police but no arrests have been made.
*13:52.180- 13:56.820* :  Sophie Long earned the car's value in dollars close to £450,000.
*13:59.600- 14:03.340* :  I'm Rachel Wright, you're listening to the Global News Podcast still to come?
*14:03.800- 14:10.120* :  I'm really happy and I'm really relieved as I think this is a crucial ride that we have to have as women.
*14:11.020- 14:14.780* :  France takes a world first step in protecting abortion rights.
*14:22.820- 14:30.000* :  As we mark International Women's Day, discover two podcasts from the BBC World Service celebrating women around the world,
*14:30.240- 14:35.300* :  where to be a woman is the brand new podcast exploring in which countries women are living their best lives.
*14:35.300- 14:39.640* :  And my award-winning podcast, Dear Dota, is back for season three.
*14:40.040- 14:44.760* :  Join me, Namalanta Combo, as I update my handbook to life for daughters everywhere.
*14:45.040- 14:49.400* :  Search for where to be a woman and Dear Dota wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*14:52.900- 14:59.280* :  The Ghanaian Finance Ministry has urged the president not to sign a new bill aimed at restricting gay rights,
*14:59.280- 15:02.240* :  saying it risks derailing the country's economy.
*15:02.780- 15:08.480* :  The anti-gay law sets prison sentences for up to three years for anyone identifying as gay.
*15:08.480- 15:16.460* :  Now the opposition MP who introduced the legislation, Sam George, says the Ministry by criticising the new law
*15:16.880- 15:19.360* :  is selling the innocence of Ghanaian children.
*15:19.820- 15:23.400* :  We are in this state because the Finance Ministry hasn't managed the economy,
*15:24.180- 15:30.800* :  and if they think that the solution to mismanage in the economy is mortgaging the cultural heritage of Ghana
*15:31.380- 15:34.600* :  and the innocence of our children, that is completely unacceptable,
*15:34.660- 15:36.440* :  and that's not something we're going to count on.
*15:37.320- 15:40.400* :  I'll corresponded in Accra, Thomas Nadi told me more.
*15:40.740- 15:45.040* :  The Finance Ministry is concerned because according to them,
*15:45.460- 15:53.060* :  there are a lot of ongoing negotiations with the World Bank to try to secure funding to resource-state Ghana's alien economy.
*15:53.380- 16:02.200* :  These negotiations will be affected if the bill becomes law because it restricts the rise of sexual minorities in the country
*16:02.200- 16:10.920* :  and we know that institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, the embrace values such as inclusivity and diversity.
*16:10.940- 16:18.780* :  So any attempt to limit those values will have an impact on whatever arrangements that you have with them.
*16:19.260- 16:27.460* :  And the Ministry even estimates that the country could lose a total of $850 million this year alone.
*16:27.980- 16:33.680* :  They indicate it will affect Ghana's foreign reserves and exchange risk stability.
*16:34.320- 16:37.920* :  This is an unprecedented move by the Finance Minister, is it not?
*16:38.480- 16:47.460* :  It is, and there's a justification for it because the country is going through very difficult economic times.
*16:48.040- 16:51.980* :  A lot of ordinary geniuses are struggling to get by.
*16:52.420- 16:56.940* :  The economy is in crisis and needs agent funding.
*16:57.560- 17:04.580* :  Now the country is under a 3-year IMF bailout support program in December 2022.
*17:05.380- 17:10.440* :  Inflation was around 54%. Record 54%.
*17:10.440- 17:16.460* :  So it's hit a lot of families and disrupted a lot of livelihoods in the country.
*17:16.960- 17:29.480* :  So the Finance Minister needs to make this kind of intervention to ensure that the President doesn't take any decision that we hit the country or the economy in the long term.
*17:29.700- 17:36.980* :  A lot of geniuses feel that it's a good call, but as to whether the President will hit it, it's a different ballgame.
*17:37.480- 17:49.840* :  But we understand that he's beholden consultations with development partners and doing agencies trying to gauge their opinions about this particular bill and the way forward.
*17:50.720- 17:51.420* :  Thomas Naadi.
*17:52.220- 18:03.040* :  Argentina's state-run news agency has been producing stories for 80 years, but on Monday the 800 staff at Tellam were told to go home for at least seven days.
*18:03.040- 18:09.920* :  It's part of the bid by the new President, Javier Millet, to roll back the state and cut the budget deficit.
*18:10.500- 18:16.420* :  I asked our Latin America correspondent, Ioni Wells, what was happening and why the President was doing it.
*18:16.720- 18:30.260* :  It's not totally clear whether this is a permanent closure of the news agency or if this is temporary, but workers who turned up to work today there found that the doors were barred closed and police were outside and they were told not to come back for a week.
*18:30.780- 18:38.100* :  Now this does come after President Millet said when he opened Congress on Friday that he would close this news agency down.
*18:38.640- 18:49.260* :  We go on the website today, it is taken down, it comes up with an error message saying that the site is under reconstruction and as I say they were sort of police outside the office stopping people from entering.
*18:49.680- 19:04.080* :  Now when the President spokesman was asked about this at a press conference today, he said that the government had sent an internal statement to all staff exempting them from work for seven days with pay while the President's plan moves forward.
*19:04.100- 19:14.340* :  So it is a little bit unclear exactly what will happen next as I say at the President had said he plans to close it, but his spokesman today said this will need to be approved by Congress.
*19:14.680- 19:26.260* :  Now this is an issue that the Argentine President has faced with a lot of his plans so far because he doesn't have a majority in Congress, so it's not quite clear whether this is actually a plan that he'll be able to go through within the long term yet.
*19:26.840- 19:30.560* :  And this must have come as a bit of a shock to the staff there or was it?
*19:31.360- 19:42.100* :  That's right, I mean I think there was certainly sort of some warning that this might happen given his statement when he opened Congress saying that he believed that this news agency should be shut down.
*19:42.100- 19:50.060* :  And this is part of a kind of wider push from the President to close various public sector organizations, but certainly the workers have reacted strongly.
*19:50.060- 19:57.300* :  Both workers at the agency and opposition parties have said that this is a attack on the press and there are protests planned in response to this.
*19:57.960- 20:05.320* :  I only wells. France has become the first country to protect abortion rights by having them enshrined in its constitution.
*20:06.000- 20:12.940* :  Parliamentarians on Monday approved the motion by the necessary for this majority at a special meeting in Versailles.
*20:13.440- 20:21.220* :  Supporters of abortion rights in France have been alarmed by the United States Supreme Court's ruling to end federal protection two years ago.
*20:21.680- 20:27.420* :  And the move has been broadly welcomed by people in France, including 25-year-old Louvre from Paris.
*20:28.020- 20:35.520* :  I'm really happy and I'm really relieved as I think this is a crucial right that we have to have as women today.
*20:35.520- 20:46.540* :  And I think a lot of people don't understand the insecurity that can come with the inability of having legal abortion and the danger it can also provide.
*20:46.540- 20:49.880* :  And so I think this is really relieving in that way.
*20:50.120- 20:55.060* :  Like I have at least like five friends around me who had to go through abortion and I'm only 25.
*20:55.060- 21:05.400* :  And so I guess like if you take away that rights, you can only imagine like how many women would be in very dangerous health conditions.
*21:06.260- 21:10.720* :  Use Gafel spoke to us from a rather noisy trocadero in central Paris.
*21:11.240- 21:20.780* :  The Eiffel Tower has been lit up with sparkling lights to mark this vote which some people here regard as very important and very historic.
*21:20.780- 21:30.100* :  There's a meeting of a few hundred activists, many people are from feminist associations here who are of course delighted by what has happened.
*21:30.100- 21:44.620* :  And they see this as historic as an example to the world as an example of how a country in France can resist what they fear may be coming which is a kind of regression of reproductive rights.
*21:45.460- 21:47.460* :  And that's how this whole debate has been framed.
*21:47.500- 21:55.840* :  It was because of the Supreme Court decision in America that this whole movement started in France to put the right to abortion in the constitution.
*21:55.840- 22:13.820* :  It got taken up by President Macron and the argument very much has been that even though France may feel safe from the kind of retrogressions they would put it now, we can't rule out what might happen in the future and there are countries in Europe where abortion rights are in jeopardy.
*22:14.100- 22:34.780* :  So for that reason there's a great deal of elation, exhilaration here tonight among these feminist groups not many in number to be honest with you which I think reflects how among the population as a whole this hasn't really galvanized a huge amount of emotion for the simple reason that known regards really abortion rights to be in jeopardy here.
*22:35.400- 22:49.780* :  Hughes co-filled in a rather noisy Paris now it is perhaps the best known song in the English language happy birthday and it's celebrating a birthday of its own 100 years since it first appeared as sheet music.
*22:50.280- 23:03.020* :  In fairness the song has a long and interesting history with a number of possible dates that could be said to mark its anniversary but Monday was as good an occasion as any to celebrate the life of happy birthday.
*23:03.600- 23:06.080* :  Rob Croson looks back at the song's origins.
*23:10.860- 23:13.880* :  There isn't a song on the planet that's harder to avoid.
*23:16.500- 23:25.860* :  But love it all of it the happy birthday to you song is having its own birthday today a century on when it first appeared as sheet music.
*23:27.620- 23:36.160* :  All possibly first appeared as we'll find out regardless it's a tune that a century on we're not even close to time.
*23:36.760- 23:38.440* :  Happy Birthday Jung
*23:53.560- 24:01.820* :  Marilyn Monroe The Beatles and The Master Space Rover singing happy birthday to itself on the fifth anniversary of its time on Mars.
*24:02.900- 24:08.820* :  Until 2015, if you wanted to use Happy Birthday in a song, film or documentary, you had to
*24:08.920- 24:09.180* :  pay.
*24:09.420- 24:15.920* :  It was in a kindergarten in Kentucky, sometime in 1893, when two sisters, Mildred and
*24:15.920- 24:21.040* :  Patty Hill, led their young pupils on a daily rendition of a rhyme they'd penned with
*24:21.040- 24:22.920* :  the title Good Morning to You.
*24:23.220- 24:28.200* :  The song was printed in sheet music form in a book by Robert Coleman on March the 4th,
*24:28.200- 24:33.860* :  in 1824, and the first copyrighted version of the song appeared in a song book made by
*24:33.860- 24:39.820* :  the Hill Sisters Publishers in 1935, over a verse that replaced Good Morning with Happy
*24:39.820- 24:40.300* :  Birthday.
*24:40.860- 24:46.180* :  The Hill Sisters was sitting on a cash cow, but by the 1980s, the copyrighted passed on
*24:46.180- 24:51.680* :  to a seriously big player in the music industry, as Liz Williams, a London-based music copyright
*24:51.680- 24:52.840* :  supervisor, explains.
*24:53.180- 24:57.740* :  So, I believe it was Warner Chappell that ended up purchasing the rights.
*24:58.480- 25:02.860* :  So yeah, if you, just like with any other commercial track, if you wanted to use it in a film, even
*25:02.860- 25:07.660* :  if you've got the actors singing it, you'd be having to license those rights.
*25:07.660- 25:13.740* :  Having to pay Warner Chappell to use the song came crashing down in an American courtroom
*25:13.740- 25:14.740* :  in 2015.
*25:15.600- 25:21.160* :  This was when the song was freed of the Judge George H. King ruled that Happy Birthday to
*25:21.160- 25:23.400* :  you was in the public domain.
*25:23.700- 25:28.460* :  Given that Happy Birthday hadn't ever been really registered properly during that kind
*25:28.460- 25:34.440* :  of window of inception, that meant that they could look at the public domain release
*25:34.940- 25:39.920* :  as of the day of the melody created of the original song that they used to base Happy
*25:39.920- 25:40.420* :  Birthday on.
*25:40.700- 25:46.580* :  What sealed the song's liberation from Warner Chappell was when a song book from 1922 was
*25:46.580- 25:51.880* :  unearthed during the case, pre-dating the Coleman version by two years and the copyrighted
*25:51.880- 25:54.440* :  Hill Sisters version by Over a Decade.
*25:55.000- 25:59.940* :  Is it possible that Happy Birthday doesn't actually know when it's unbirthday is?
*26:03.920- 26:08.980* :  Until such a time as an actual date, rather than just the year, can be found in the publication
*26:08.980- 26:15.340* :  of the Smoking Gun version from 1922, then it seems we're sticking with March the 4th.
*26:18.180- 26:22.280* :  Well, these Williams believes there's still a chance that the birthday candles of the
*26:22.280- 26:25.240* :  future could be blown out to another tune.
*26:25.540- 26:27.660* :  I mean, what's going to be the next Happy Birthday?
*26:27.660- 26:28.160* :  Who knows?
*26:28.240- 26:29.960* :  Maybe there will be one, maybe there won't.
*26:35.660- 26:38.900* :  Stevie Wonder ending that report from Rob Crossen.
*26:42.040- 26:45.800* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the global news
