*02:06.240- 02:10.820* :  I'm Nick Mars and at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 22nd of March these are our main stories.
*02:11.500- 02:17.020* :  Large areas of Ukraine are suffering blackouts after Russian missiles targeted energy infrastructure.
*02:17.720- 02:22.700* :  The UN Security Council has failed to adopt a draft US resolution calling for an immediate
*02:22.700- 02:29.020* :  and sustained ceasefire in Gaza. After weeks of political unrest Senegal prepares for Sunday's
*02:29.020- 02:36.280* :  presidential election. Also in this podcast by taking a simple blood test we've shown that we
*02:36.280- 02:41.060* :  can get the results of the molecular analysis back within two weeks and that of course is really
*02:41.060- 02:45.820* :  important if you've got something like lung cancer which can grow quite quickly. The test being
*02:45.820- 02:50.660* :  offered to lung cancer patients in England that can identify whether they can be treated with
*02:50.660- 02:59.500* :  tablets instead of chemotherapy. There's been a big new wave of Russian missile and drone attacks
*02:59.500- 03:05.200* :  in Ukraine. They've particularly targeted the country's critical infrastructure like power plants.
*03:05.800- 03:10.960* :  Up to a million people have been left without electricity so far. At least one missile hit a major
*03:10.960- 03:16.960* :  hydroelectric dam on the Danipro river at Sabaritia. Valentinia lives right by it.
*03:18.780- 03:24.580* :  We saw everything because our windows overlook the dam. I woke up at four in the morning thinking
*03:24.580- 03:31.580* :  it was just thunder. Then I realized it wasn't thunder. At 430 all hell broke loose. There were
*03:31.580- 03:37.940* :  terrible fireworks and explosions. At one point our tall high-rise house tilted. There were two
*03:37.940- 03:44.160* :  huge fireballs where the dam is and several explosions one after the other. Then it all went quiet
*03:44.540- 03:49.560* :  and only the fires were burning and then half an hour later it all began again.
*03:50.460- 03:56.020* :  Thursday nights attacks follow several days of Russian bombardments of Ukrainian border towns and
*03:56.020- 04:01.200* :  villages. Hundreds of frail and elderly people have been helped to move further into the country
*04:01.200- 04:06.320* :  for their own safety. Our recent Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford reports from Suomi near the
*04:06.320- 04:16.360* :  Russian border. Nina Skorkina has just lost everything she owns and her daughter can't comfort her.
*04:18.360- 04:24.080* :  When Russian planes first bombed her village the 87-year-old refused to leave. Then the peace
*04:24.080- 04:34.320* :  rescue teams came for her. The elderly were evacuated under fire with officers urging them on
*04:34.320- 04:42.100* :  and out of danger. The most frail were carried on stretchers made of blankets, rushed over
*04:42.100- 04:49.620* :  bridges already bombed. This is all happening in the Suomi region in Northeastern Ukraine
*04:49.660- 04:57.200* :  right on the Russian border. The police video captures images of whole streets there
*04:57.840- 05:01.320* :  destroyed by air strikes in a sharp escalation in attacks.
*05:06.500- 05:11.180* :  When I visit a temporary shelter for the evacuees the first thing I hear is a plea for help
*05:11.180- 05:20.740* :  for Ukraine's soldiers, anything to push the Russians back. The next outburst is of anger,
*05:22.180- 05:28.480* :  a Vladimir Putin who launched this war and just secured himself another six years in the Kremlin.
*05:29.360- 05:38.120* :  This is Tatyana. Putin is our enemy. What did he come here for? We never touched him.
*05:41.120- 05:46.720* :  The Vladimir Putin has vowed to go on with his war and in Suomi that means more busloads of
*05:46.720- 05:54.820* :  elderly villagers who've lost everything. This is the latest evacuation of people from
*05:54.820- 05:59.500* :  villages that are under fire close to the Russian border being brought here for safety.
*06:00.180- 06:03.100* :  More Ukrainians have had their lives turned upside down by this war.
*06:06.880- 06:12.960* :  Those on board are confused as well as scared. One lady is brought a pot of homemade jam with her
*06:13.380- 06:21.340* :  and little more. She tells me she used to go shopping in Russia just across the border.
*06:22.200- 06:25.260* :  Now Russia's military has destroyed her home.
*06:28.520- 06:31.760* :  But up in Suomi is not only the fighting the people are fleeing.
*06:34.720- 06:37.660* :  The families wheeling their cases into a reception center,
*06:38.080- 06:42.400* :  escaped occupation, a life under Vladimir Putin's rule.
*06:44.620- 06:50.220* :  Zoya and her husband traveled three days to reach here from her son and a village that's now
*06:50.220- 06:58.880* :  full of Russian soldiers. Zoya tells me she's left her son because life under Russian control
*06:58.880- 07:04.980* :  crushed her spirit. For two years she's been pressured to deny her identity to take
*07:04.980- 07:09.880* :  her Russian passport, even to vote for the man who ordered the invasion of her country.
*07:14.120- 07:16.500* :  So I ask how it feels to be in Ukraine again.
*07:20.080- 07:27.260* :  As you were driving here I started to cry. I breathed in the fresh Ukraine air. Yes, we are
*07:27.260- 07:29.040* :  Ukraine's. We're great.
*07:30.120- 07:32.460* :  Zoya ending that report by Sarah Reinsford.
*07:33.780- 07:38.020* :  The U.N. Security Council in New York has failed to adopt a draft resolution
*07:38.020- 07:43.600* :  calling for an immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza. The measure had marked a change
*07:43.600- 07:48.420* :  of policy for Washington, which had previously blocked calls for a permanent truce.
*07:48.800- 07:54.720* :  But the text was vetoed by Russia and China. The U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield
*07:54.720- 07:59.040* :  said the measure was desperately needed. Every day without a deal,
*07:59.920- 08:04.800* :  meaning every day without a ceasefire, leads to more needless suffering.
*08:05.900- 08:11.900* :  For more than 100 hostages, including a one-year-old child being held in captivity by Hamas and other
*08:11.900- 08:19.200* :  groups, for innocent Palestinians in Gaza, who have been displaced, who are starving, who desperately
*08:20.300- 08:24.460* :  need peace. But ahead of the vote, the Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzia,
*08:24.880- 08:29.660* :  urged members of the Security Council not to support the draft, saying it sent a wrong signal.
*08:30.940- 08:38.380* :  Ladies and gentlemen, if you do this, you will cover yourselves in disgrace.
*08:41.220- 08:46.920* :  Consider once again how will you look before the population at the Middle East, in front of
*08:47.120- 08:51.280* :  your own populations, if you support this hypocritical initiative.
*08:52.060- 08:56.940* :  My colleague, Paul Henley, has been speaking to our UN correspondent, Netatorfic, in New York.
*08:56.940- 09:03.860* :  I think, based on past resolutions, Russia and China were very clear that they wanted to see
*09:03.860- 09:10.340* :  an immediate ceasefire and nothing less. Remember past resolutions looked at various languages,
*09:10.340- 09:15.080* :  calling for a pause in the fighting, creating conditions for a sustainable ceasefire.
*09:15.640- 09:20.840* :  And the language in this U.S. draft resolution was very carefully worded.
*09:21.200- 09:28.600* :  It did suggest that an immediate and sustained ceasefire would come as a part of the hostage
*09:28.600- 09:34.480* :  deal. It directly tied an immediate and sustained ceasefire to that hostage deal being negotiated
*09:34.480- 09:40.320* :  by the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar. And so what we heard in the Council from Russia and China,
*09:40.320- 09:48.600* :  but also Guiana, which abstained, was they felt given how dire this situation is in Gaza at the
*09:48.600- 09:56.900* :  moment, and the death toll of over 32,000 civilians killed in Israel's military campaign there,
*09:57.340- 10:02.120* :  that the Security Council should be calling for an immediate ceasefire without any conditions
*10:02.760- 10:09.080* :  at all. They also expressed concern that the draft resolution, while it did emphasize concern
*10:09.080- 10:14.160* :  about a ground-defensive in Ruffa, it didn't clearly and unequivocally oppose it.
*10:14.580- 10:22.760* :  So there were a few points there. I think that made many expect this veto by Russia and China on
*10:22.760- 10:28.660* :  this U.S. draft. And what they have said is that if the United States is serious about a ceasefire,
*10:28.660- 10:33.840* :  it should vote for a rival draft that's been put forward by the elected seven members of the
*10:33.840- 10:39.560* :  Council, which demands an immediate ceasefire, calls for the unconditional release of hostages,
*10:39.560- 10:45.560* :  and also calls for more humanitarian access. Have you heard reaction from the Israeli ambassador
*10:45.560- 10:51.780* :  to the UN? Both the Israeli ambassador and the Palestinian ambassador are in the Council,
*10:52.440- 10:57.280* :  so we will be hearing from them. At the moment, Switzerland is speaking as they first go through
*10:57.280- 11:02.300* :  the various members of the Security Council, but we will be able to hear reaction a bit later.
*11:02.460- 11:08.520* :  Neutrophic. Chemotherapy is a key part of many cancer treatments, but the side effects like
*11:08.520- 11:14.980* :  nausea and hair loss can be hugely debilitating and hard to live with. Now, a new blood test being
*11:14.980- 11:19.580* :  tried out here in the UK for people with lung cancer may mean doing away with chemotherapy
*11:19.580- 11:24.920* :  altogether. The test can show if they would benefit from treatment in tablet form instead,
*11:24.920- 11:30.800* :  and promises a result within two weeks. Professor Peter Johnson is a clinical director for cancer at
*11:30.800- 11:35.900* :  the UK's National Health Service. The way we do this is we take a small blood sample and we look
*11:35.900- 11:42.080* :  for fragments of DNA which have been shed by the cancer as it's growing into the bloodstream,
*11:42.660- 11:47.420* :  and we can look at the genetic makeup of that, and we can look at the molecular abnormalities
*11:47.420- 11:52.840* :  that have taken place as the cancer's develop. When somebody has an X-ray or CT scan which shows
*11:52.840- 11:57.340* :  something on it that looks like a lung cancer, we have to arrange for them to usually have a bronchoscopy,
*11:57.340- 12:01.980* :  that's a look down into the airways to take tissue samples from that which we then send off to
*12:01.980- 12:05.920* :  the laboratory. Those have to be processed and analyzed. We have to look at the molecular changes
*12:05.920- 12:11.520* :  in those, all of which of course is complicated to organize and takes time. By taking a simple blood
*12:11.520- 12:15.860* :  test, we've shown that we can get the results of the molecular analysis back within two weeks,
*12:16.200- 12:20.040* :  and that of course is really important if you've got something like lung cancer which can grow
*12:20.040- 12:25.380* :  quite quickly. So, how big an impact could this have? Fergus Walsh is our medical editor.
*12:26.000- 12:31.420* :  2,000 patients with suspected lung cancer have already benefited from the test so far,
*12:31.800- 12:37.740* :  and then the coming year for the 10,000 patients will be given the test. And what the test can do
*12:38.520- 12:45.720* :  is it can find out and detect whether there are genetic mutations in the tumor which are driving
*12:45.720- 12:52.140* :  cancer growth and will respond to targeted drugs in tablet form, and these are often very effective
*12:52.140- 12:59.180* :  at shrinking tumors more effectively than often standard chemotherapy and have fewer side effects.
*12:59.180- 13:05.640* :  It's really a game changer for many of these patients who I've spoken to, and this is the first
*13:05.640- 13:12.380* :  time that these blood tests have been put into standard treatment for the diagnosis of cancer.
*13:12.600- 13:16.660* :  It's still a pilot, but it's definitely the direction of travel we're seeing, and I think
*13:16.660- 13:22.100* :  ultimately we'll see it spread to other tumor types for the diagnosis, say, of breast cancer
*13:22.100- 13:28.220* :  and in childhood cancers. Fergus Walsh. Malaysia says it's turned down an offer to host the
*13:28.220- 13:34.040* :  2026 Commonwealth Games because of the cost. The decision puts the event in doubt.
*13:34.040- 13:37.220* :  Our Asia-Pacific Regional Editor, Mickey Bristow reports.
*13:37.960- 13:42.380* :  Malaysia was asked to hold a sporting event after the Australian state of Victoria with
*13:42.380- 13:47.580* :  Druid's offer, but it's decided it will be too expensive to host the games. This might
*13:47.580- 13:53.320* :  be in promise more than $100 million by the Commonwealth Games Federation. It's not clear who,
*13:53.320- 13:59.360* :  if anyone will now host the next event in two years' time. So we're also questioning the point
*13:59.360- 14:05.060* :  of the games because of their colonial origins. The countries that take part all have links to the
*14:05.060- 14:09.780* :  former British Empire. Mickey Bristow. Now for a bit of escapism.
*14:16.640- 14:21.420* :  The unmistakable music from the film The Great Escape Starring Steve McQueen,
*14:21.800- 14:26.300* :  the film which captured one of the most famous stories about British prisoners of war.
*14:26.900- 14:32.300* :  It is the 80th anniversary this weekend of the breakout by 76 men from a German prisoner of war
*14:32.540- 14:37.040* :  camp. Fifty of them were killed and most of the rest recaptured, but were they betrayed?
*14:37.860- 14:42.360* :  When Lieutenant Desmond Plunkett, the map maker in the escape, was liberated,
*14:43.040- 14:47.360* :  he filled out a questionnaire in which he told a British authorities that he believed that they
*14:47.360- 14:52.820* :  were brought down by their own side. Well, that document has just come to light at the National
*14:52.820- 14:57.540* :  Archives in London. Will Bartlett is the military expert there and he's been speaking to Martha
*14:57.820- 15:01.440* :  Carney. There's a very short passage at the end of a questionnaire which all prisoners of
*15:01.440- 15:06.880* :  war fill out where he essentially accuses and he uses the phrase too indigenous Englishman
*15:07.740- 15:15.960* :  of collaborating with the Nazi authorities around the recapture and execution of the 50
*15:16.520- 15:21.780* :  of those who are executed after The Great Escape. Which, you know, it's a quite serious allegation.
*15:21.840- 15:26.160* :  It's not one that we'd ever come across before in all of the research that we've done.
*15:26.160- 15:30.600* :  So, you know, it really stood out to us when we were looking at those questionnaires.
*15:30.860- 15:34.720* :  Well, it's quite specific, isn't it, the way that he talks about there being
*15:35.620- 15:42.700* :  too indigenous Englishman? Yeah, so, you know, it seems for sure that he has people in mind
*15:42.700- 15:48.520* :  in that moment. The very strange thing is, you know, the process in which all of this happens is
*15:48.680- 15:53.220* :  a lot of the liberated prisoners of war undertook these questionnaires, they filled out these
*15:53.220- 15:57.280* :  questionnaires. And that was really the first stage in the in the process. He would have been
*15:57.280- 16:02.240* :  interviewed a number of times after that as well. And again, that accusation doesn't come through
*16:02.240- 16:08.740* :  in the same way thereafter. So, whether there's a change of mind or, you know, he thinks about it
*16:08.740- 16:13.480* :  a little bit differently immediately afterwards. Obviously, we're kind of unsure in that respect.
*16:14.080- 16:16.980* :  And looking more generally, is there any evidence that there were
*16:17.960- 16:22.660* :  informants inside the prisoner of war camps? Most certainly, you know, there's evidence
*16:22.660- 16:27.760* :  across the war that, you know, the German and Nazi authorities were putting in stewedges.
*16:27.760- 16:32.200* :  They were often called, if you like, individuals who, you know, were placed in prisoner of war camps
*16:32.200- 16:37.880* :  for that kind of purpose to gather intelligence to stop escape attempts, you know, to find out
*16:37.880- 16:43.720* :  any information they could. And there's absolutely evidence of that. Again, we have evidence of
*16:43.720- 16:49.000* :  in the National Archives, for example. And tell us a little bit more about Desmond Plunkett himself,
*16:49.000- 16:54.560* :  of people who've watched the film over many, many years, will know the character played by
*16:54.940- 17:00.360* :  Donald Pleasant's in the film. Plunkett was one of the forges the map makers. He was a pilot,
*17:00.360- 17:06.560* :  of course, and shot down in 1942. He did survive the war, obviously, but was obviously one of the
*17:06.560- 17:12.560* :  escapers. And he was one of the last to be recaptured along the Austrian border. He went on to carry
*17:12.560- 17:18.460* :  on his career in the Air Force after the war. He's a fascinating character. His escape is an
*17:18.460- 17:23.660* :  interesting one. There's some kind of comical elements, some rather slapstick elements to his time
*17:23.660- 17:30.780* :  on the run after escaping in March 1944. But, you know, certainly one of those interesting characters
*17:30.780- 17:35.020* :  and one that, you know, we've had the pleasure of researching at the National Archives as part of
*17:35.020- 17:41.420* :  our exhibition as well. That was Will Butler. Still to come in this podcast.
*17:41.540- 17:48.400* :  The smell of the baby is kind of a wonderful experience for parents. Until the baby's mature and
*17:48.400- 17:53.140* :  at some point become teenagers, as though we decided to follow that up in a real investigation.
*17:54.100- 17:58.700* :  The real reason why your baby smells nice, while your teenager does not.

*20:04.780- 20:09.500* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Time is running out for Donald Trump. He has
*20:09.500- 20:14.720* :  until next Monday to secure a half a billion dollar fine imposed on him for lying about the
*20:14.720- 20:19.780* :  value of his assets. He's appealed against the ruling and says he doesn't have enough cash to
*20:19.780- 20:24.060* :  pay the fine. But there could be one potential lifeline for the former president.
*20:24.060- 20:30.800* :  Sirana Tawari our business reporter explains. Among his many businesses, Mr. Trump has Trump
*20:30.800- 20:36.640* :  media which runs the social media platform truth social. Now that's poised to become a publicly
*20:36.640- 20:42.880* :  listed company with shareholders of another company called Digital World Acquisition Corp.
*20:43.200- 20:49.180* :  And digital world is set to vote later today on whether to acquire Trump media.
*20:49.680- 20:56.020* :  Now that would give Mr. Trump a stake of at least 58% in the merged company and that's worth
*20:56.520- 21:03.040* :  more than three billion dollars at digital world's current share prices. Digital world is what's
*21:03.040- 21:10.640* :  known as a SPAC. It's a type of mechanism to be able to list publicly on the New York Stock Exchange.
*21:11.280- 21:17.620* :  And of course this is an astonishing potential windfall for Mr. Trump at a very trying time for him.
*21:19.980- 21:26.060* :  But there are many issues with the deal. So it's not full proof at all.
*21:26.360- 21:29.360* :  Well it sounds so if it does go through, it's probably going to be enough money,
*21:29.360- 21:36.180* :  though, isn't it? It probably is. The problem is there are many red flags associated with the deal
*21:36.180- 21:42.920* :  including unresolved lawsuits from former business partners. There's also the problem that digital
*21:42.920- 21:49.640* :  world has already shelled out a lot of money to resolve other fraud charges over how the merger
*21:49.640- 21:56.880* :  came to be, about 18 million dollars in a settlement. The other issue for Mr. Trump is that he's
*21:56.880- 22:03.460* :  actually not allowed to sell his shares for at least six months if this company does go public,
*22:03.460- 22:09.680* :  although the new company could grant him an exception. What he could get is a loan backed by
*22:09.680- 22:17.080* :  the value of his shares. But many analysts say that a bank would probably lend him significantly less
*22:17.080- 22:22.840* :  than the shares are worth on paper given the potential risks of the business. So what happens if
*22:22.840- 22:27.920* :  it doesn't go through to the bailiffs going to Mar-a-Lalgo? Well that's the big question. There are so
*22:27.920- 22:35.320* :  many legal cases that former president Trump is involved in, but he has been given this deadline
*22:35.320- 22:41.980* :  until Monday to put up this money. And he's what you call, he's not exactly cash rich. He has a lot
*22:41.980- 22:48.540* :  of businesses, but he doesn't have that most that cash that's really needed to try and resolve
*22:48.540- 22:55.700* :  these fraud charges. That was Surajana Tawari. People in Senegal go to the polls on Sunday in an
*22:55.700- 23:00.240* :  election that was supposed to be held last month, but three weeks before the due date, president
*23:00.240- 23:05.600* :  Mackie Sal announced it would be delayed a decision that sparked violent clashes between police
*23:05.600- 23:11.020* :  and protesters in which three people died. Unlike so many of its West African neighbours,
*23:11.020- 23:16.420* :  Senegal has never experienced a coup and power tends to change hands at the ballot box.
*23:17.140- 23:22.380* :  But is its reputation as a beacon of democracy changing? James Coppnell reports from Dacca.
*23:27.760- 23:33.180* :  Election campaigning, Senegalese style, we've got a huge truck, we've posted it all over it
*23:33.520- 23:39.460* :  of Basseru-Jomay Fire, one of the main candidates, lots of horns and vuvuzella blaring out.
*23:39.940- 23:44.960* :  This is the Medina popular neighbourhood in Dacca, and they're here to try and convince everybody
*23:44.960- 23:52.240* :  to turn out to vote on Sunday. But this is no ordinary election, just over
*23:52.240- 24:04.080* :  a month ago there was drama in Dacca. This is the moment when President Mackie Sal delayed
*24:04.080- 24:11.640* :  the election, to December long past the end of his final term, it led to approval. Eventually,
*24:12.020- 24:17.800* :  after a court ruling and considerable domestic and international pressure, the long delay was
*24:17.800- 24:24.420* :  scrapped. The vote will now take place this Sunday. All the same, for many, Senegal's solid
*24:24.420- 24:31.220* :  democratic standing has taken a battering. This week the president told the BBC he had no regrets.
*24:34.400- 24:39.200* :  What happened during the last three months shows that there was an information campaign
*24:39.200- 24:48.460* :  targeting Senegal and its president. There was a gap of one month between the initial
*24:48.460- 24:56.380* :  date of the election and the election of March 24, just one month. So we still have to put
*24:56.380- 25:01.420* :  into perspective the judgments we make about Senegal, its democracy and its president.
*25:02.520- 25:08.760* :  Not everyone agrees. I think Mackie Sal, he has been an Axial president.
*25:08.760- 25:15.420* :  This is Gilles Yebbey who runs a think tank here. He praises Mackie Sal for raising Senegal's profile
*25:15.420- 25:21.580* :  on the international stage over the 12 years he's been in power and for infrastructure development.
*25:22.460- 25:28.380* :  But he describes to some extent this legacy at the very end of his term because he tried
*25:28.380- 25:33.920* :  clearly to exclude their position and the fact that you have hundreds of people who actually
*25:33.920- 25:38.960* :  are arrested during the demonstrations and at the very end you have a president proposing
*25:38.960- 25:45.980* :  himself an amnesty law. So I think that is the end of his mandate is unfortunately
*25:46.060- 25:53.200* :  tarnishing his legacy. Back at the opposition rally, they're hoping they're
*25:53.200- 25:58.320* :  baseroj on my fly. One of the front runners will defeat the candidate from the president,
*25:58.320- 26:04.840* :  political movement and the Dubai. With almost 20 candidates in total there may well be a second round.
*26:05.780- 26:09.540* :  But for these opposition supporters Senegal desperately needs change.
*26:30.660- 26:35.320* :  We just driven past another rally. This one for Amadou Barth, former Prime Minister,
*26:35.900- 26:40.760* :  the sort of continuity candidate I guess. You certainly know there's an election going on.
*26:41.640- 26:48.580* :  James Coppano in Senegal. Now here's a question for you. Why do babies smell sweet and teenagers
*26:49.160- 26:53.720* :  about stinky? What scientists in Germany say they can provide us with the answer.
*26:54.420- 27:00.500* :  Ilona Kroy is a psychologist at Friedrich Schiller University in Yenna in Germany
*27:01.100- 27:06.240* :  at a co-author of the new research. What is the common observation everyone probably shares who
*27:06.240- 27:12.080* :  has children is that the smell of a baby is kind of a wonderful experience for parents. Until the
*27:12.540- 27:18.340* :  babies are mature and at some point become teenagers and then parents don't like the smell of
*27:18.840- 27:24.740* :  babies or of their teenagers. Not anymore. So we decided to follow that up in a real investigation,
*27:24.740- 27:30.480* :  not just asking the parents but really collecting body orders of babies and of teenagers and
*27:30.480- 27:34.920* :  of toddlers and of everyone in between. And what we discovered there is that the parental
*27:34.920- 27:41.400* :  perception of the order really changes, namely that the parents are not able to recognize the
*27:41.400- 27:46.840* :  body order of their teenage boy or girl any longer and they do not prefer it any longer.
*27:47.360- 27:52.020* :  And then we followed this investigation by investigating the composition of the body orders
*27:52.420- 27:57.120* :  and then we found that really the body order composition changes around puberty
*27:57.680- 28:02.040* :  so that the quality of the body order is ordered. There are different chemical compounds in it.
*28:02.300- 28:06.100* :  So this is nothing to do with the fact that teenagers are often more particularly boy teenagers
*28:06.100- 28:10.460* :  and not very good at washing. It is what is coming out of the pores of the skin.
*28:11.040- 28:16.380* :  Exactly. It is not just that the quantity would be altered or something like this. It is really what
*28:16.380- 28:21.240* :  is coming out of their pores. Yes. So, Ilona, can you talk me through the evolutionary advantages
*28:22.080- 28:28.640* :  of the babies having such a pleasant recognizable smell? So that the baby has a very pleasant smell
*28:28.640- 28:33.740* :  has something to do with bonding behavior. So if you have a pleasant smell as a baby,
*28:33.740- 28:39.020* :  that means that the parents want to spend more time with you and that increases the bonding
*28:39.020- 28:44.380* :  and the baby is of course very dependent on parents. And this pleasant smell of the baby
*28:44.880- 28:49.960* :  we can also observe this when we look into the parental brain, that there are pleasant and reward
*28:49.960- 28:55.300* :  areas in the parents activated by smelling this baby body order. And why would that not be
*28:55.300- 29:01.900* :  such a desirable trait when it comes to your teenagers? Something else comes into play here.
*29:02.320- 29:07.940* :  The baby body order is particularly pleasant not only because I know it but also because it's
*29:07.940- 29:14.320* :  genetically related to my own body order. But when it comes to teenagers, it's not an
*29:14.320- 29:19.960* :  advisable thing to prefer or when it comes to made choice. It's not an advisable thing to
*29:19.960- 29:25.760* :  prefer someone who is genetically very much related to you. So you have this interaction between
*29:25.760- 29:30.740* :  hormones, sexual hormones, which are signaling, sexual maturity, which are signaling,
*29:30.740- 29:36.660* :  okay, someone would be a potential mate. And this is what happens after puberty and the
*29:36.660- 29:44.200* :  genetic compound. And that leads parents to be more repulsed by the body order of their teenagers.
*29:44.980- 29:51.280* :  Ilona Kroyder. Back in the 1970s, being a photographer to the top music stars made you a bit
*29:51.280- 29:57.880* :  of a star yourself. Jill Fominovsky was one such person. She started chronically in the careers of
*29:57.880- 30:03.760* :  people like Bob Marley and Pink Floyd, Amy Whitehouse and many others besides. And this month
*30:03.760- 30:10.300* :  Jill Fominovsky will receive a major award in recognition of her achievements. But as Guy Lambert
*30:10.300- 30:14.580* :  reports, it wasn't obvious that she'd end up mixing in such elevated circles.
*30:18.400- 30:22.440* :  As a child, it would have been hard for Jill to imagine she'd go on to have the astonishing
*30:22.440- 30:27.140* :  career and photography that she's had. Growing up in southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe,
*30:27.640- 30:33.000* :  before moving to London at the age of 11, where Bitalmania was in full swing. And Jill found
*30:33.000- 30:39.040* :  herself thrust into the heart of the frenzy. I was slightly too young to be an applescrap because
*30:39.040- 30:43.740* :  they got to do sort of errands for the road crews and things like that, but I'm ill-concigarette.
*30:43.760- 30:48.540* :  But I was certainly an autograph hunter. I did stand outside. I'd be rode a grade deal.
*30:48.680- 30:53.460* :  I remember hearing that Paul McCartney would allow applescrufts to walk Martha, his dog sometimes.
*30:53.620- 30:58.780* :  A very trusting of applescrufts. He was very generous. Yeah, I mean, I took my first rock shot
*30:58.780- 31:04.440* :  of him outside his house. He was and still is, up for honouring the fans if that's the right word.
*31:04.680- 31:08.860* :  The art of photography was a skill that Fermanovsky had to learn quickly, while studying
*31:08.860- 31:14.340* :  textiles and graphic design at Central St Martin's in London. After only two weeks training,
*31:14.340- 31:20.460* :  she had a lucky break. At London's premier rock venue, the Rainbow Theatre in 1972.
*31:20.860- 31:25.720* :  They gave you a college camera for the weekend, and I was going to the Rainbow Theatre to see
*31:25.720- 31:30.880* :  the band yes. I took this college camera with me. If I go down the stairs and come down to the
*31:30.880- 31:35.600* :  auditorium, maybe they won't notice that I'm not professional with this fancy-looking camera,
*31:35.600- 31:40.260* :  and that's that's what I did. They offered me their position as the official photographers,
*31:40.260- 31:45.760* :  you know. So I actually began working at the Rainbow Theatre at the age of 18 without a salary,
*31:45.760- 31:50.380* :  but with this fantastic access to all these shows that were on. I like to think it was fate.
*31:50.900- 31:55.980* :  Before long, Jill Fermanovsky was shooting the biggest rock stars of the 1970s and 80s,
*31:56.420- 32:02.460* :  including Led Zeppelin, Blondie and the Sex Pistols. In 1994, the Fermanovsky's career
*32:02.460- 32:07.760* :  would take another life-changing turn, when a partnership with an up-and-coming band from Manchester
*32:07.760- 32:17.880* :  was born. You have this extensive relationship with Oasis. How was that born? I had a book that I've
*32:17.880- 32:23.800* :  been trying to publish called The Moment of It. It was a diary from the Beatles to whatever was
*32:23.800- 32:29.580* :  coming up now, and Oasis were coming up now. I went to photograph them, and then about a week later,
*32:29.580- 32:35.000* :  their PR said to me, would you like to work with them? And I was like, yeah, three years later,
*32:35.420- 32:41.060* :  I'd kind of documented this massive explosion of their talent. I feel as I did my best body of work
*32:41.060- 32:46.780* :  with them. Working with Oasis during their meteoric rise to Stardom presented a number of iconic
*32:46.780- 32:52.300* :  moments for Fermanovsky, but while Nebworth House and Glastonbury will always stick in the memory,
*32:52.300- 32:57.900* :  there was one concert that will forever be the most memorable. For me, main road was there's even
*32:57.900- 33:02.380* :  more extraordinary than Nebworth, and when they walked out on that stage with all the little
*33:02.380- 33:10.800* :  houses in the background and that crowd. I still get a shipper from it now, you know, because sort
*33:10.800- 33:16.080* :  of a homecoming, it was a sort of look what we've done Manchester. If it wasn't for a photo shoot
*33:16.080- 33:22.140* :  with the Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts in 1992, the Oasis adventure may never have happened.
*33:22.540- 33:26.140* :  When I took that picture of Charlie, I did a little shoot within a full cue magazine,
*33:26.140- 33:31.120* :  and there was that observer competition coming up with Jane Bound Ward, and I put it into that and
*33:31.120- 33:35.680* :  couldn't believe I wanted. Charlie Watts is renowned for being the most modest member of the
*33:35.680- 33:40.080* :  Rolling Stones, and when the portrait of him was named the winner, he wrote to Fermanovsky.
*33:40.260- 33:44.360* :  So I've got a hundred and lesser from him saying, you know, congratulations on winning the photo
*33:44.360- 33:50.780* :  award and everything. And then he signed it, see our Watts, and then in brackets, drummer
*33:50.780- 33:56.860* :  Rolling Stones. Just in case you didn't know. That report was by Guy Lambert.
*33:59.560- 34:03.140* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*34:03.140- 34:08.300* :  later on. And on Saturday, you can hear this week's edition of The Happy Pod with Harry Blight.
