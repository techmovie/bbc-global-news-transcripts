*01:19.120- 01:22.500* :  This is a global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.100- 01:29.680* :  I'm Nick Karaci and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 20th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:37.840- 01:43.660* :  Haiti descends into even greater despair amid warnings there has never been a worse crisis.
*01:44.240- 01:47.940* :  This is worse than during the dictatorship of
*01:49.960- 01:55.220* :  the Supreme Court set back for the Biden administration over illegal migrant crossings from
*01:55.220- 02:01.360* :  Mexico and Brazil's Covid skeptic ex-president is formally accused of falsifying vaccine records.
*02:04.220- 02:08.500* :  Also in this podcast, a top American official warns Ukraine's fight against Russia

*02:20.920- 02:26.880* :  coordinator to help with the sex scenes in his latest drama with his real life wife.
*02:32.360- 02:36.740* :  The UN's children's agency hers described the state of Haiti as horrific.
*02:36.740- 02:42.360* :  Similar, she said, to the lawlessness of the post-apocalyptic Mad Max movies.
*02:43.020- 02:47.620* :  The gangs which have seized Haiti's streets have now taken control of the Caribbean country's money.
*02:47.620- 02:52.780* :  Several people were killed as police pushed back an assault on the central bank building in a capital.
*02:52.780- 02:58.880* :  And the concern doesn't end there. The UN is warning of famine and malnutrition and the near collapse
*02:58.880- 03:06.540* :  of basic services. So just how dire is the situation. Our correspondent Will Grant sent this report
*03:06.620- 03:09.220* :  from the Northern Coastal City of Caphation.
*03:11.480- 03:16.080* :  The main thoroughfares in Caphation capture the sense of some of the chaos of this country,
*03:16.480- 03:23.440* :  hot hold streets and piles of rubbish which have been set on fire, goats wandering in amongst
*03:23.460- 03:29.480* :  the market sellers. The thing is Haiti isn't like this because of the current crisis,
*03:30.120- 03:34.800* :  it's always like this and this is currently probably its safest city.
*03:35.300- 03:44.100* :  Haitian situation, everything bad, not hospital, no job, no good market, nothing good in Haiti,
*03:44.100- 03:47.680* :  nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. Not will government too.
*03:48.580- 03:52.800* :  Salvage, the situation is terrible first because I got fabulous help there.
*03:52.800- 03:58.440* :  It has human being, we're not supposed to be in this situation. We are like firing each other,
*03:58.580- 04:00.340* :  and that's not supposed to happen in any country.
*04:00.860- 04:08.120* :  Drive down any of the main roads from here to the capital, Porto Prince and on numerous occasions
*04:08.120- 04:13.340* :  you'll be stopped by armed gang members at makeshift checkpoints demanding money.
*04:14.100- 04:19.820* :  Haiti's problems grinding poverty and political instability haven't necessarily been caused by
*04:19.820- 04:26.820* :  the gangs but they've been seriously exacerbated by them. Will Grant reporting from Caphation?
*04:27.120- 04:32.760* :  So who can rescue Haiti from the depths? Earlier this month there's the acting Prime Minister
*04:32.760- 04:36.640* :  Ariel Henri resigned. The regional grouping of Caribbean countries,
*04:36.640- 04:41.880* :  Caricom announced a plan to set up what's called a transitional presidential council which in
*04:41.880- 04:45.780* :  term would appoint a new Prime Minister and a government. There's been a tremendous amount of
*04:45.780- 04:52.140* :  bickering and politicking over who should be on that council. One of the eight names to have been
*04:52.140- 04:58.720* :  put forward so far is Lesley Voltaire, an urban planner who was a minister under the former Prime
*04:58.720- 05:04.860* :  Minister Jean Bertrand Aristide. He spoke to Tim Franks. We are in a very dire situation.
*05:05.080- 05:12.460* :  I know there is danger. I have been in danger already because I was the minister of education
*05:12.460- 05:19.600* :  for President Aristide. We went to exile and we had like two coup d'etat. We know the problem in
*05:19.600- 05:24.960* :  Haiti and we have to do something because now all the ports are blocked. The airport is blocked
*05:25.240- 05:30.980* :  even if you want to go to the beach you cannot go to the mountain you cannot go. There is a lot of
*05:31.000- 05:38.500* :  kidnapping, rape, a lot of burglary. One has to decide if you want to live like that or if you want
*05:38.500- 05:45.160* :  to fight. I want to fight. Strong words. You say you want to fight. I mean there are those very powerful
*05:45.260- 05:51.560* :  men with guns, the gang leaders who have said that they totally reject the authority of this council
*05:51.600- 05:58.540* :  and they wish you pretty clear threats to people like you who want to say that you know where the
*05:58.540- 06:04.480* :  country should go next. We know that and this is the danger but those bandits cannot govern. They
*06:04.480- 06:11.520* :  say that they have put our yellowery out but they cannot enter into the palace, into the Prime
*06:11.520- 06:18.220* :  Minister's office. They are talking about revolution but those are sub and criminals and we cannot
*06:18.220- 06:25.060* :  let Haiti be ruled by criminals. Do you fear for your safety? Yes, I fear for my safety. My wife
*06:25.060- 06:32.280* :  reminds me every hour that I put her in danger but it's like being kidnapped in my house or when
*06:32.280- 06:38.040* :  I go to another house it's like being kidnapped so I don't see that we can live like that.
*06:38.280- 06:43.380* :  At the moment are you saying that it's not safe enough for the members of the transitional
*06:43.380- 06:50.320* :  council to meet in person? No, we have done a lot of Zoom meetings, a Google meet and what's up
*06:50.380- 06:56.660* :  but it is not safe to go to a restaurant or to go to a hotel or public space to meet.
*06:56.760- 07:02.740* :  Given that you're up against these incredibly powerful gangs who got no interest in order being
*07:02.740- 07:09.980* :  restored, I mean I just wonder what you really think you can achieve. I think those powerful
*07:09.980- 07:16.540* :  guys, they have masters in the private sector, in the political sector, they have masters in the
*07:16.540- 07:23.640* :  international sector. I think with dialogue we can integrate them into a lot of
*07:24.140- 07:31.000* :  seats in the communities, in the ministries, in the agencies. If we create a civic
*07:31.000- 07:38.560* :  corps for young people that have not been very participating in those gangs, they will integrate
*07:38.560- 07:44.580* :  that corps. I think there are a lot of formula but the fish repalates, the fish rods from the head
*07:44.580- 07:49.360* :  and that fish is rotten. So we need a new head because security begins by the head.
*07:49.520- 07:55.780* :  Just one last question, have you ever seen Haiti in the state that it currently is?
*07:55.940- 08:00.380* :  Never, I didn't plan that for my old ages. This is worse than duvalier.
*08:00.520- 08:03.740* :  It's worse than during the dictatorship of Duvalier.
*08:04.580- 08:10.220* :  Leslie Voltaire speaking to Tim Franks. The US Supreme Court has given the go ahead to a controversial
*08:10.280- 08:16.680* :  and criticized law that is set to allow state police in Texas to arrest and deport people who
*08:16.680- 08:22.480* :  have crossed illegally into the US via the southern border, neighbouring Mexico has condemned the
*08:22.480- 08:26.780* :  law as anti-immigrants. I spoke to our North America correspondent Peter Boes.
*08:27.160- 08:33.300* :  The law is still subject to legal review in a lower court, but for now at least it means that
*08:33.300- 08:38.620* :  police officers in the state of Texas will be able to arrest and prosecute migrants
*08:38.620- 08:44.480* :  suspected of illegally crossing the Mexican border. Now enforcing immigration laws,
*08:44.480- 08:50.440* :  including arrests, has typically been handled by the federal government. This law now gives that
*08:50.440- 08:57.540* :  power to Texan officials, allowing them to prosecute migrants or order them returned to Mexico.
*08:57.540- 09:02.400* :  Although reacting to this, a senior Mexican official has said that Mexico's government will not
*09:02.400- 09:09.880* :  accept migrants who Texas state officials attempt to deport under this law. Joe Biden is not happy.
*09:09.880- 09:16.120* :  The Biden administration had asked the court to put this law on hold while it challenged the
*09:16.120- 09:21.260* :  measure in the lower courts. That process is continuing with a hearing scheduled at US court of
*09:21.260- 09:27.620* :  appeals on April 3rd. The White House argues that the law violates the US Constitution and
*09:27.620- 09:33.140* :  federal law by interfering with the government's power. That's the federal government's power to
*09:33.140- 09:39.640* :  regulate immigration. The argument against that from Texas, and we've heard from the Texas attorney
*09:39.640- 09:45.820* :  General Ken Paxson who has described the decision as a huge win. He says it's about defending Texas
*09:45.820- 09:51.700* :  and its sovereignty, the state's ability to make its own decisions. No coincidence then perhaps
*09:51.700- 09:57.940* :  this is relatively good news for the Republicans in election year. Well of course this is hugely
*09:57.940- 10:02.280* :  political. In fact that's illustrated by the divide on the Supreme Court. The three liberal
*10:02.280- 10:07.660* :  justices all descended from this decision. One of them saying that the law would upend the long
*10:07.660- 10:13.100* :  standing federal state balance of power and so chaos. But yes, clearly it's going to be a huge
*10:13.100- 10:18.160* :  election issue. It has been ever since Donald Trump first came to power. Peter Boes.
*10:18.820- 10:23.220* :  It's the big question of the war in Ukraine. Well, President Zelensky's forces have enough weapons
*10:23.220- 10:29.500* :  and ammunition to keep Russia at bay at an air base in Germany. About 50 allies supporting
*10:29.500- 10:35.220* :  Kiev have been meeting to discuss the needs for more support. Lord Austin, the US defense secretary
*10:35.220- 10:42.360* :  promised Washington would not let Ukraine fail. Today Ukraine's survival is in danger and America's
*10:42.360- 10:48.140* :  security is at risk and they don't have a data waste and we don't have a data spare either.
*10:48.320- 10:53.400* :  So I leave here today fully determined to keep US security assistance and ammunition flowing
*10:53.400- 10:59.420* :  and it's a matter of honor and security for America and make no mistake Putin is watching,
*10:59.420- 11:06.400* :  the world is watching and history is watching. Our correspondent Jessica Parker in Berlin has
*11:06.400- 11:12.160* :  been following that news conference. I started by asking how was Lloyd Austin able to make these
*11:12.160- 11:18.500* :  promises despite Republicans in Congress currently blocking a massive military aid package for Kiev?
*11:18.960- 11:27.420* :  Lloyd Austin is trying to reassure allies that the will is there so we know a $60 billion aid package
*11:27.420- 11:34.000* :  to Ukraine is stuck in Congress and he's talked as well about 300 million they've managed to
*11:34.000- 11:39.260* :  source as a sort of one-off fund to help Ukraine with its defense and its security but look I mean
*11:39.260- 11:43.340* :  I think this was a bit of a difficult balance for Lloyd Austin you know with this aid package
*11:43.340- 11:48.940* :  stuck and with all that uncertainty as well around the US elections and what change that might mean
*11:49.000- 11:53.860* :  he is trying to reassure allies but at the same time people I speak to here in Europe are very
*11:53.860- 11:58.760* :  much saying they are looking at what they need to do in Europe to become more self-sufficient
*11:59.580- 12:04.360* :  and Lloyd Austin seemed to give his approval to this Czech initiative for Shells
*12:04.600- 12:11.080* :  yes so the Czechs have proposed going beyond borders of the EU to look for
*12:11.600- 12:16.860* :  artillery shell ammunition supplies because a lot of the discussion has been in Europe about
*12:17.480- 12:22.740* :  we need to ramp up our own domestic industrial base but some nations are coming very far behind
*12:22.740- 12:27.980* :  in doing that and what the Czechs are saying is let's pull cash together and or look to third
*12:27.980- 12:35.240* :  countries outside of the EU in order to try and get that desperately needed ammunition to Ukraine
*12:35.960- 12:40.660* :  Jessica Parker when the former Brazilian President Jaya Bolsonaro was in office during the
*12:40.660- 12:45.620* :  Covid pandemic he was one of the few world leaders who spoke up publicly against the vaccine
*12:46.300- 12:51.160* :  and encouraged society to do the same he also promoted unproven treatments
*12:51.700- 12:57.460* :  well now Brazilian police have formally indicted him of fraud relating to his Covid vaccination
*12:57.460- 13:02.280* :  records he had been under investigation since last year and our South America correspondent
*13:02.280- 13:07.980* :  Iony Wells who is in São Paulo told me more what they have said is that even though he publicly
*13:07.980- 13:13.020* :  claimed many times that he had not had a Covid vaccine and he said that he was very much against
*13:13.020- 13:18.360* :  having a Covid vaccine they say that his health records so that he said that he did have one
*13:18.840- 13:22.060* :  and why that was significant is that would have meant that he would have been able to for example
*13:22.060- 13:27.940* :  travel to the US at a time when foreign visitors needed to have had a Covid vaccine now he has
*13:27.940- 13:32.460* :  denied this and said that he has not tampered with any of his Covid vaccination records but
*13:32.460- 13:36.940* :  what police have said today is that they have enough evidence to formally accuse him this could
*13:36.940- 13:41.380* :  mean now that the Attorney General's office in Brazil is going to essentially decide whether to
*13:41.380- 13:46.200* :  formally charge him in which case he could well face further criminal proceedings all very
*13:46.200- 13:50.100* :  interesting this isn't it that's right only this is just one of a kind of number of investigations
*13:50.100- 13:54.700* :  that the former president is facing I think what's really interesting about this particular
*13:54.700- 13:59.620* :  claim as well is that the Brazilian authorities have already actually said publicly as part of
*13:59.620- 14:04.940* :  a separate investigation that that his Covid vaccine records were false they say that there was
*14:04.940- 14:10.120* :  a number of different pieces of evidence to suggest this including that the date he was claimed
*14:10.120- 14:15.440* :  to have had it was actually not when he was in São Paulo they also say that the nurse who was
*14:15.440- 14:20.220* :  allegedly the person administering it has denied doing so so there's already been various
*14:20.220- 14:25.220* :  pieces of evidence found to suggest that the documents were false he has said which is something
*14:25.220- 14:29.520* :  he's repeatedly claimed that this is part of a sort of political stitch up but he has said when
*14:29.520- 14:34.980* :  it comes to this particular investigation that he is in his words calm and that he kind of has
*14:34.980- 14:39.560* :  repeated that he didn't receive the vaccine so there is this irregularity here where his public
*14:39.560- 14:44.360* :  health records say that he did he claims that he didn't but he also claims he didn't have any
*14:44.360- 14:49.280* :  intampering with Brazil's National Health Service has about his health and medical history.
*14:50.040- 14:55.480* :  Only Wells in São Paulo. A 39-year-old man has become the first person in England and Wales to
*14:55.480- 15:00.960* :  be jailed for cyber flashing and offense created by the Online Safety Act. Nicholas Hawkes was
*15:00.960- 15:07.380* :  sentenced to a year in prison at Crown Court in London for sending unsolicited explicit photos to
*15:07.380- 15:13.140* :  a 15-year-old girl and a woman. The move has been widely welcomed by campaigners Justin Webb
*15:13.560- 15:18.620* :  spoke to Emily A-TAC, actor presenter and campaigner and Zoe Billingham, the former police
*15:18.620- 15:24.720* :  inspector. First we hear from Emily who made a TV documentary specifically about what happened to
*15:24.720- 15:30.740* :  her. I named my documentary asking for it which is an awful slogan that women have had thrown
*15:30.760- 15:36.340* :  at them our entire life and it was a particular look at the online space and cyber flashing and
*15:36.380- 15:40.560* :  the ripple effect that's had on my life, my family's life. It was something that I was kind of
*15:40.560- 15:45.380* :  suffering within silence, not knowing if this was happening to anybody else and I found the more I
*15:45.380- 15:50.540* :  spoke about it and more I realized what a huge issue this was. To people who haven't seen it,
*15:50.540- 15:58.400* :  it was stuggling the level of personal abuse and obscenity that you personally were subjected to.
*15:58.540- 16:03.840* :  Yeah, I started to talk about it in like a humorous way to kind of get attention on it,
*16:03.920- 16:08.320* :  but the fact was I was receiving these messages and I'm talking thousands and thousands a day
*16:08.320- 16:14.440* :  from different men from images, videos. I found that it was really kind of chipping away, questioning
*16:14.440- 16:19.560* :  my entire being, everything I was as a woman, why does this happen to me? I'm a particular type of
*16:19.560- 16:24.320* :  woman that this happens to, so when you hear people talking about a change in law, I welcome it
*16:24.320- 16:28.840* :  with open arms because the issue around cyber flashing and sexual violence generally is that there
*16:28.840- 16:33.520* :  are these constant supposed gray areas. These behaviors have been normalized since the beginning
*16:33.520- 16:38.260* :  of time and that is something that we really need to look at. A change in law is one thing but it's
*16:38.260- 16:44.020* :  about having society on your side to say no, this is a crime, it is wrong, not just so that somebody
*16:44.020- 16:49.180* :  has punished for it, but so that it changes people's mindsets on it and it unpicks a really systemic
*16:49.180- 16:53.960* :  problem that's been going on for a long time and taking these supposed normalized behaviors
*16:53.960- 16:59.480* :  and saying that they are absolutely unacceptable and they cause long-lasting psychological harm.
*17:00.000- 17:05.860* :  I've been talking to Zoe Billingham, former Inspectorate of Constabulary. We started just with the
*17:05.860- 17:12.080* :  overall significance of the court case, the sentencing and what it signifies. I think it's a really
*17:12.080- 17:17.800* :  important day, it's a demonstration of the state's intent to tackle violence against women and girls
*17:17.800- 17:23.180* :  and to take crimes against them absolutely seriously. This is no laughing matter just in this
*17:23.500- 17:28.380* :  absolutely needs to be dealt with. There's a serious sexual offense, the police are already investing
*17:28.380- 17:33.180* :  significant resources into making sure that they contract down offenders of these crimes and
*17:33.180- 17:38.700* :  prevalence is eye-watering isn't it? You know the idea that three out of four of our listeners'
*17:38.700- 17:44.080* :  daughters between the ages 12 and 18 will receive an unsolicited new picture, I mean it's just
*17:44.200- 17:48.140* :  extraordinary, it's become normalized. Well that's the point isn't it, the close one of the
*17:48.140- 17:53.080* :  questions is where there's a piece of legislation like this actually changes the minds of those girls
*17:53.080- 17:58.800* :  and says to them no you don't have to just put up with this. We hope that this legislation will
*17:58.800- 18:04.280* :  often in itself empower women to say no this is not normal, I shouldn't be being humiliated in
*18:04.280- 18:09.480* :  my tube journey to school, I shouldn't be receiving these unsolicited pictures of boys and men,
*18:09.540- 18:14.220* :  I should be able to say no and when I step forward to the police they should be taking my complaint
*18:14.220- 18:19.460* :  seriously. So we're building a reformer, police inspector of constabulary and before that
*18:19.460- 18:27.780* :  act a Emily A-tack. Still to come on the global news podcast. The buildings have decorative
*18:27.780- 18:33.300* :  screens to shield the sun, they're long and thin, often one room thick so that they can be
*18:33.300- 18:39.220* :  cross ventilated by the sea breeze. African architecture takes center stage at a new exhibition
*18:39.220- 18:53.480* :  in the UK called Tropical Modernism. With just over four months to Paris 2024,
*18:53.580- 18:58.480* :  Olympics officials meeting in Switzerland have announced the Russian and Belarusian athletes
*18:58.480- 19:03.540* :  competing at the Games under a neutral flag will not be able to take part in the opening ceremony.
*19:03.540- 19:07.980* :  The International Olympic Committee has also called on governments around the world
*19:07.980- 19:12.700* :  to boycott Russia's rival athletics competition known as the Friendship Games.
*19:12.780- 19:18.860* :  It's a very strong language then from the IOC as I put to our sports news correspondent Laura Scott.
*19:19.380- 19:25.620* :  They've called out Russia for overtly politicising sports, something that they say is a blatant
*19:25.620- 19:31.200* :  violation of the Olympic charter. The Friendship Games isn't exactly a new event. The first
*19:31.200- 19:37.680* :  one was held in 1984 after the boycott of the Olympics in Los Angeles. They're hoping that it's a
*19:37.680- 19:42.720* :  commercial prospect for athletes around the world. They quite clearly want countries to send
*19:42.720- 19:49.120* :  their athletes there and it is in a few weeks after the Olympics finishes and the IOC have
*19:49.120- 19:54.560* :  called on governments and Olympic committees and federations to not send their athletes there.
*19:55.060- 20:00.760* :  I ask them if they would consider any sanctions for anyone who does take part and they said that
*20:00.760- 20:05.800* :  they would have to look at that very closely indeed so they're not ruling out sanctioning
*20:05.800- 20:10.800* :  anyone who does take part. When we talk about the Olympics and specifically the opening ceremony,
*20:10.800- 20:15.760* :  what's happening there with regards to Russian and Belarusian athletes? Well they've decided the
*20:15.760- 20:19.800* :  executive board of the International Olympic Committee that Russian and Belarusian athletes
*20:19.800- 20:26.060* :  won't be taking part in the opening ceremony at Paris. Now this is a very unique opening ceremony.
*20:26.060- 20:30.780* :  It involves a parade of boats up the river Sen and they've said that those athletes who are
*20:30.780- 20:36.540* :  neutral athletes in individual sports won't take part in that parade. They said that the logic
*20:36.540- 20:40.400* :  to that is because these athletes aren't part of a team and therefore it wouldn't really be
*20:40.400- 20:45.340* :  appropriate for them to take part in that parade. They have said that they'll invite them to enjoy
*20:45.340- 20:51.900* :  the experience in some way but we won't see them on the boats. And they can participate in the games
*20:51.900- 20:57.720* :  but still under a neutral flag. Exactly. It was announced in December that athletes from
*20:57.720- 21:03.500* :  Russia and Belarus who qualify for the games can compete as neutrals. That's only an individual
*21:03.500- 21:08.840* :  events. No teams from Russia and Belarus will take part. They said that so far there are 12
*21:08.840- 21:13.820* :  individual neutral athletes with a Russian passport and seven individual neutral athletes with a
*21:13.820- 21:18.880* :  Belarusian passport who've qualified so far of the 6,000 quota places already awarded.
*21:19.420- 21:25.360* :  Laura Scott. Google's artificial intelligence division deep-mind has created a prototype
*21:25.360- 21:31.560* :  AI football coaching assistant to help teams improve their performance. The program tactic AI
*21:32.020- 21:35.840* :  was developed in collaboration with the English Premier League Club Liverpool. Here's Danny
*21:35.840- 21:41.440* :  Aberhardt. Elite sport is big business and increasingly big data helps give an edge.
*21:41.440- 21:46.820* :  Football fans might not care for the algorithms but if it means their teams defend corners better
*21:46.820- 21:52.480* :  they'll no doubt swallow the encroachment on the game's romance. Deep-mind focused on corners
*21:52.480- 21:57.320* :  partly because they and other set pieces account for about a third of goals but also because
*21:57.320- 22:03.320* :  they start from a fixed point. The company says tactic AI analyzed thousands of real corners
*22:03.320- 22:10.380* :  and suggested tweaks to defenders positioning. In blind tests it says real human experts at Liverpool
*22:10.380- 22:18.220* :  preferred the AI positioning in 90% of scenarios. Such innovations it says could revolutionize sport
*22:18.220- 22:24.320* :  and be applied to fields ranging from robotics to traffic control. But analysing the dynamism
*22:24.320- 22:30.660* :  of open play remains a challenge even for AI so the likes of Jürgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola
*22:30.820- 22:36.520* :  won't be out of a job just yet. Danny Aberhardt there. Now here's a question. Our bears
*22:36.520- 22:42.100* :  becoming a problem in the Eastern European country of Slovakia and does there need to be a
*22:42.100- 22:47.680* :  change of regulations so that bears can be hunted and culled. Well last weekend two people needed
*22:47.680- 22:53.820* :  medical treatment after Aberhardt was seen bounding through the northern town of Liptovsky
*22:53.820- 23:00.240* :  Mikolash. The attack came a day after a Belarusian woman apparently fell to her death as she fled a
*23:00.240- 23:06.020* :  bear in the nearby Lotutra Mountains. The authorities are now trying to kill the bear and have told
*23:06.020- 23:12.140* :  residents to avoid the forest. Yana Kabeesaver is a journalist covering the environment at
*23:12.140- 23:19.140* :  actuality.sk. The Slovak news website and she spoke to Tim Franks. Slovakia has the privilege to
*23:19.140- 23:25.580* :  have bears because our neighbor countries they almost don't have any bears because they killed
*23:25.580- 23:32.120* :  their population. We have brown bears. They don't attack people normally just only if they are
*23:32.220- 23:39.240* :  and most cases of incidents between bears and humans were because bears were protecting their babies.
*23:39.660- 23:46.460* :  People should change their behavior about bears because we have problems with waste which is
*23:46.460- 23:52.260* :  available for bears. What you're saying is that there should be greater focus on sort of
*23:52.260- 23:58.100* :  preventing the interaction between humans and bears. One of the things that the government is
*23:58.340- 24:04.200* :  looking at from what I understand is whether the laws about the hunting and the killing of bears
*24:05.060- 24:11.400* :  should be changed whether the rules should be loosened. We have a in our government people
*24:11.400- 24:19.560* :  were sharing boxes about bears and now they are not able to solve problems about bear population
*24:19.620- 24:27.660* :  according to effects and scientific information. They are trying to solve it by gun
*24:28.080- 24:34.680* :  which is the last option to shoot the bears and they are even trying to make pressure on
*24:35.540- 24:43.680* :  European Commission to reclassify bear into another category of protection so that they will be
*24:43.680- 24:51.100* :  able to regulate bear population more radically than it is now because now bear is protected
*24:51.100- 24:58.220* :  in our country by national and also by EU law but they can shoot the problematic ones.
*24:58.560- 25:03.040* :  Bears are still on the endangered species list. How is the population doing in Slovakia?
*25:03.400- 25:10.320* :  We have a population in a good condition. The bears are able to have more babies and the population
*25:10.320- 25:19.500* :  is rising but not so exponential. We should focus on that how to live with this protected animals
*25:19.500- 25:27.860* :  in symbiosis not to kill them all because this political situation is leading to eliminate
*25:27.860- 25:35.060* :  all the bears. Yama Kabeaseva speaking to Tim Franks. Well now it's easy to see why actors would
*25:35.060- 25:41.060* :  want someone to navigate awkward sex scenes on set but what are the actors of both married.
*25:41.560- 25:45.840* :  The Scottish actor Yuen McGregor said it was still necessary in his latest series
*25:45.840- 25:53.060* :  Gentleman in Moscow despite him starring opposite his wife Mary Elizabeth Winstead he said it's
*25:53.060- 25:58.980* :  also about the crew and it's odd to be naked in front of people it's odd to be intimate in front of
*26:01.620- 26:10.720* :  the camera. She's not dressed. I've seen her films they're not very good. I'm afraid they're
*26:10.720- 26:15.780* :  quite ill-behaved. I always think behaviour is a matter of handling. Yes I'm sure you do.
*26:17.100- 26:22.120* :  The trailer for the adaptation of Emore Tal's novel is streaming on Paramount Plus from March
*26:22.120- 26:29.500* :  29th. Intimacy coordinated Robbie Taylor Hunt has worked on big dramas including Sky Atlantic's
*26:29.500- 26:35.280* :  Mary and George Netflix's You and the BBC's Everything I Know About Love. He told Ceremon to
*26:35.280- 26:40.340* :  you more about the importance of his role. The intimacy coordinators are there to help make what
*26:40.340- 26:44.860* :  is ultimately quite a personal thing to have to do a professional process so actually when we're
*26:44.860- 26:49.160* :  talking about married couples there's even more risk really of mudging the water between the
*26:49.160- 26:53.020* :  personal and professional that people don't take it as seriously or they're a bit more kind of
*26:53.020- 26:57.080* :  casual and personal with them because they go oh you already know each other so you'll find
*26:57.080- 27:00.800* :  sort of thing was actually they're still having to do the incredibly intimate and slightly
*27:00.800- 27:06.440* :  awkward thing of performing an act of simulated sex together in a room full of crew and their
*27:06.440- 27:10.480* :  colleagues although they might feel a bit more comfortable they're still a process that
*27:10.480- 27:15.340* :  that needs to be treated properly. I suppose as well they could be being asked to do things in this
*27:15.360- 27:21.980* :  scene which they might not normally do as she said delicately. Exactly yeah we don't know anything
*27:21.980- 27:27.340* :  about that real couples intimate life and so to assume that like oh you'll be okay doing this
*27:27.340- 27:32.140* :  type of sex act is adding assumptions and making her personal comment on those actors' lives.
*27:32.740- 27:37.700* :  You're a sort of choreographer aren't you? Are you advising people where to put their hands? I
*27:37.700- 27:43.620* :  mean how detailed does it become? It can be about giving kind of containers of what it is and what
*27:43.620- 27:48.220* :  it's not what the have journey through the intimacy should be or we can be really specific and
*27:48.220- 27:52.760* :  really choreograph each beat be very clear with what the motions are where hands go at what
*27:52.760- 27:56.960* :  moments but when it comes to simulated sex as well ultimately you're trying to make something
*27:56.960- 28:02.240* :  that's not happening look like it's happening like with staged violence and we have equipment we have
*28:02.240- 28:07.880* :  kit we have modesty garments and all sorts of tricks of the trade to help make these things feel
*28:08.320- 28:12.960* :  repeatable and safe for the performers but realistic and creative and dynamic and characterful
*28:12.960- 28:18.220* :  and exciting for the performers and the audience. So are sex scenes better now than intimacy
*28:18.220- 28:22.460* :  coordinators involved? Absolutely yeah I think when people are comfortable and when the director
*28:22.460- 28:26.120* :  feels more able to have these conversations frankly with an intimacy coordinator support
*28:26.120- 28:30.560* :  when the actors can really feel supported they give better performances because they're going great
*28:30.560- 28:34.980* :  I can really go for it I can really find what I think my character needs because I know I have this
*28:34.980- 28:39.660* :  professional overseeing the whole process. We're talking about you and McGregor and his second wife
*28:39.660- 28:46.340* :  who met on the film set Fargo there are famous cases of actors falling in love and of course
*28:46.580- 28:51.980* :  presumably intimate scenes hastening that process. Yeah it's a really interesting one so within
*28:51.980- 28:56.660* :  intimacy practice we talk about closure practice so because when we're potentially naked with
*28:56.660- 29:01.460* :  someone our body is still skin-to-skin contact with someone and actually kissing them so that does
*29:01.460- 29:05.960* :  a certain thing too kind of physiological response we're trying to allow it to have a kind of closure
*29:05.960- 29:11.180* :  behind it to go right let's not let that spill into your lunch break it's like oh good we worked on
*29:11.180- 29:15.800* :  that together and goodbye we can go back to being colleagues now. Really so what do you advise people
*29:16.060- 29:20.860* :  in a way to stop them falling in love? We're all very happy to be able to fall in love generally
*29:21.240- 29:27.040* :  part of that closure practice is just helping someone keep a sort of professional scope to the
*29:27.040- 29:32.360* :  intimate scene they worked on it. I bet the husband or wife at home love you. Yeah I'm quite
*29:32.360- 29:36.640* :  full about that actually but I suppose they would be grateful for us. Robbie Taylor Hunt speaking to
*29:36.640- 29:44.020* :  Sarah Montague. Tropical modernism is a new exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum here in
*29:44.020- 29:50.680* :  London it looks at how in the 1950s architecture in Ghana changed as Britain's African colonies
*29:50.680- 29:56.600* :  asserted their own identity and it shows how those changes helped pave the way towards independence
*29:56.600- 30:02.660* :  as Vincent Dowd reports. Citizens of the new state of Ghana gather for the celebration marking their
*30:02.660- 30:11.300* :  day of freedom from colonialism. It's an exhibition about buildings and politics. It looks at India as
*30:11.300- 30:17.300* :  well but at the centre of the exhibition is Ghana becoming the first sub-Saharan African nation
*30:17.300- 30:22.980* :  to become independent of Britain. Christopher Turner of the V&A Museum in London.
*30:23.360- 30:29.060* :  After the Second World War when so many colonial troops had been in action they were
*30:29.420- 30:34.480* :  increasing calls for independence and this was supported by America. The British colonial
*30:34.480- 30:41.720* :  office advocated a philosophy of gradualism and they poured a lot of money into programs to build
*30:41.720- 30:48.880* :  schools, universities supposedly to prepare the colonies for eventual self-government really to
*30:48.880- 30:59.960* :  try and offset calls for independence. Yet on March the 6th 1957 independence came with Kwame
*30:59.960- 31:05.660* :  Unkrumah as Ghana's leader. The new show evokes the pride and excitement of that moment.
*31:13.780- 31:18.060* :  Modernist architecture after World War II had been the work of white architects
*31:18.060- 31:24.040* :  above all of the British couple Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew. That did not change overnight
*31:24.040- 31:30.840* :  but President Unkrumah wanted to see African designers at work too, such as John Augusto Ado
*31:31.060- 31:37.440* :  who is now 95. We were more or less the first generation of green architects. Whatever building was
*31:37.440- 31:44.280* :  put up Unkrumah wanted it to, in line with the most modern trends the wanted Ghana to be a showpiece
*31:44.280- 31:50.620* :  for Africa and the world. Christopher Turner says the exhibition shows European modernism adapted
*31:50.620- 31:58.120* :  for Africa. The results, he says, were practical and attractive. The buildings have decorative screens
*31:58.120- 32:03.880* :  to shield the sun. They're long and thin, often one-room thick so that they can be cross-ventilated
*32:03.880- 32:10.060* :  by the sea breeze. They have wide overhanging eaves to create shade and the colonial circumstance
*32:10.060- 32:12.880* :  allowed for the invention of this style.
*32:24.060- 32:29.900* :  Kwame Unkrumah lost power in a coup in 1966. Samia Unkrumah is his daughter.
*32:30.300- 32:37.320* :  Even before independence he started thinking he and his colleagues at the government of how Ghana
*32:37.320- 32:45.940* :  would build itself as an independent nation. That's quest for self-reliant hospitals, factories,
*32:46.120- 32:54.300* :  everything to do with nation-building had to express new identity, gradually expressing ourselves
*32:54.460- 33:01.340* :  as we become stronger and more economically confident. Tropical modernism changed the look of parts
*33:01.340- 33:08.260* :  of Ghana's cities, but Professor John Augusto Ado regrets that today its influence is all but gone.
*33:08.940- 33:15.280* :  And almost vanished and you can see high rise buildings in Africa now. And instead of building
*33:15.740- 33:24.380* :  to see the traffic, you see buildings wrapped in glass from Europe and America to use mostly by
*33:24.380- 33:32.520* :  photographs. The new exhibition isn't only about global architecture, it's an introduction to
*33:32.520- 33:39.260* :  the politics of independence and to the huge changes Africa has seen in the last seven decades.
*33:45.380- 33:46.880* :  Vincent Dowd with that report.
*33:49.780- 33:54.220* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
