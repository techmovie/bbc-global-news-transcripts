*01:28.800- 01:33.360* :  I'm Paul Moss and in the early hours of Sunday the 17th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:33.920- 01:39.580* :  Russia's elections are not going entirely according to plan with polling stations facing sabotage
*01:39.580- 01:44.360* :  attempts and the country's suffering yet more attacks from Ukraine. We'll be hearing how
*01:44.360- 01:53.040* :  Russians are voting in neighboring Latvia and Estonia. I voted for Putin. He's closer to my
*01:53.040- 01:58.680* :  viewpoint. I understand him. I have no doubts about him. India has announced the date of its
*01:58.680- 02:04.520* :  general election and the Iranian scholar and political activist arrested. No reason given.
*02:06.820- 02:11.640* :  Also in this podcast, Egypt's vast film and television industry has suffered a blow
*02:11.640- 02:18.100* :  with the country's biggest studio destroyed by a fire. This is a cinematographer's studio that
*02:18.100- 02:24.740* :  TV shows used to film TV series in Ramadan and films as well. The place is always active and nobody
*02:24.740- 02:30.000* :  knows what happened. And why the French banquet has become a more frugal feast.
*02:34.800- 02:39.060* :  It was supposed to be a demonstration of how smoothly things are running in Russia,
*02:39.060- 02:44.860* :  despite its war with Ukraine. But this weekend's election is not going entirely according to plan.
*02:44.860- 02:49.580* :  There have been attempts to sabotage polling stations. One of them even catching fire.
*02:49.980- 02:54.240* :  Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev said those responsible were traitors.
*02:54.900- 02:58.480* :  Then there are the ongoing attacks from Ukraine, a cross-border raid,
*02:58.960- 03:02.320* :  and continuing missile attacks on targets inside Russia.
*03:09.320- 03:13.800* :  That was the air raid siren going off in Belgorod, a region of Russia which borders Ukraine.
*03:13.800- 03:19.380* :  A missile attack there killed two people. Russia, said Ukraine, was engaged in terrorist
*03:20.160- 03:24.920* :  activities. Meanwhile, the Belgorod governor, the Ashislav Gladkov, ordered that children remain
*03:29.500- 03:33.700* :  at home. We will poll all parents who bring their children to the duty groups in kindergarten.
*03:33.980- 03:40.460* :  We will ask if possible for the children to stay at home on Monday and Tuesday. Of course,
*03:40.460- 03:47.400* :  safety is the primary concern for all of us. When Vladimir Putin makes his stirring would-be
*03:47.400- 03:53.500* :  patriotic speeches, he's often expressed concern for ethnic Russians who live outside the country,
*03:53.500- 03:59.440* :  mainly in neighboring states, which were once part of the Soviet Union. Take Estonia, for example,
*03:59.440- 04:04.340* :  about a quarter of the population there speak Russian. Indeed, some remain Russian citizens.
*04:05.100- 04:10.280* :  And as Boleg Belderev reports, many of them are being crossing the border into Russia to cast
*04:10.280- 04:15.900* :  their vote in the current election. Here in a stony and border town of Narva lies the frontier
*04:15.900- 04:21.800* :  between the Western world and Russia. Across the river, with its formidable fortress lies Ivan
*04:21.800- 04:27.880* :  Gharat, a town 170 kilometers away from St. Petersburg. And this is one but a handful of places where
*04:27.880- 04:32.780* :  the border between EU and Russia is still open. What's even more unusual that in these
*04:32.780- 04:37.660* :  places, in the surrounding region, thousands of people are, in fact, Russian citizens.
*04:38.600- 04:44.660* :  This is the legacy of Soviet Union breakup. In the 1960s and 1970s, people were brought from
*04:44.660- 04:50.060* :  Soviet Union to work in local industries. And after the collapse of Soviet Union, they failed to get
*04:50.060- 04:55.460* :  Estonian citizenship. This is the source of bitter arguments between the residents and the
*04:55.460- 05:00.060* :  Estonian authorities. But the fact is that these people have applied and got Russian passports.
*05:00.340- 05:05.340* :  And this means they can go and vote in the presidential elections which are taking place right now.
*05:06.080- 05:10.020* :  There weren't any big cues on this side of the border. We tried and looked for people who would
*05:10.020- 05:15.620* :  cross over and vote. And most people were turning away. They clearly not willing to talk about this.
*05:15.680- 05:19.960* :  They are afraid that if they admit that they voted, this will somehow mean trouble for them.
*05:20.580- 05:24.000* :  But one woman named Anna was not afraid to talk.
*05:29.300- 05:34.260* :  I voted for Putin. He is closer to my viewpoint. I understand him. I have a sister there.
*05:34.260- 05:39.100* :  My husband's brother is there. Our relatives are buried there to cut us apart his painful.
*05:40.420- 05:44.280* :  We spoke to several more people who confirmed that the cross the bridge and that they voted.
*05:44.600- 05:50.180* :  They supported Mr. Putin. Their votes didn't matter much from Mr. Putin. His victory in this election
*05:50.180- 05:56.200* :  is a foregone conclusion. Narva illustrates a very complex situation the Baltic states are in.
*05:56.720- 06:00.260* :  Nervously watching over their giant neighbors to the east, Russia.
*06:00.860- 06:05.660* :  Bolieg-Bolgeirov there. Next door to Estonia, many of Latvia's sizeable ethnic
*06:05.660- 06:11.180* :  Russian population also have a right to vote. However, they will cast their ballot at the Russian
*06:11.180- 06:16.640* :  embassy in the capital Riga. Our correspondent there, Sergei Goryashko, told me that the Latvian
*06:16.640- 06:22.000* :  authorities stand accused of hindering the voting process. The Latvian police claims that they
*06:22.000- 06:27.440* :  are going to check the documents of those people who come to the Poland stations on Sunday
*06:27.440- 06:33.660* :  to check if they are in the country legally. So if they possess visa or residence permits,
*06:33.660- 06:38.880* :  Russian officials are claiming that this is an interference by Latvia in the elections.
*06:38.980- 06:44.160* :  Of course, Latvian officials criticize the election themselves. They claim that they are
*06:44.160- 06:50.640* :  regutan, that their result is predicted already. They consider the old presidential action in Russia
*06:50.640- 06:57.220* :  as an illegal event. What is the situation for ethnic Russians living in Latvia? Can they openly
*06:57.220- 07:02.580* :  show support for Vladimir Putin or for Russia's invasion of Ukraine or do they tend to feel they need
*07:02.580- 07:06.520* :  to keep quiet? In relay itself in the Latvian capital there are no
*07:06.520- 07:13.580* :  many people who openly support Vladimir Putin. However, there are some who do. I haven't found any
*07:13.580- 07:19.380* :  willing to talk publicly about their support of Vladimir Putin, but we could look at the results
*07:19.380- 07:25.900* :  of the previous Russian presidential action in 2018. According to the results from the polling station
*07:25.960- 07:31.760* :  in Latvia and the Russian embassy, around 94% voted for Vladimir Putin there.
*07:32.180- 07:37.060* :  So there are definitely some people who do support Vladimir Putin who live here in Latvia. Of
*07:37.100- 07:42.100* :  course, there have been numerous violations at the polling stations. Of course, the results
*07:42.100- 07:48.280* :  can be rigged. However, independent observers claim that usually having the Russian embassies
*07:48.680- 07:55.240* :  stuff doesn't bother themselves trying to rig the results of the elections. So the results at
*07:55.240- 08:00.720* :  the polling stations abroad can be considered as real. This is why Latvian officials are so
*08:00.900- 08:07.200* :  bothered with the election now because they know that here in the country there is definitely
*08:07.200- 08:12.140* :  a number of people who do support Vladimir Putin and they show that support, for instance, at the election.
*08:12.660- 08:18.600* :  Sergei Goryashko in Latvia. The dates for the Indian general election have been announced. It
*08:18.600- 08:23.920* :  will take place on seven dates from the 19th of April to the 1st of June. A correspondence
*08:23.920- 08:29.000* :  Samira Hussein has more details about what's often described as the world's largest democratic
*08:29.000- 08:35.200* :  exercise. I'm actually in the very busy jet butt market in Delhi. There are lots of people out
*08:35.200- 08:41.440* :  the weather is perfectly temperate. Now, what they've done is they've divided the country into seven
*08:41.440- 08:49.140* :  different phases and each phase will have their time to go and vote. You have one area that will
*08:49.140- 08:55.220* :  encompass some northern states, some southern states and some eastern states and these states
*08:55.520- 09:00.300* :  will go and vote in the first phase and that's how they go on with these elections because remember
*09:00.300- 09:07.260* :  we're talking about a country that has 960 million eligible voters in this 2020 election.
*09:07.420- 09:14.220* :  Pulling it off is really quite a feat which is why it takes so long to actually get every vote counted.
*09:14.360- 09:19.940* :  The expectation is the results should come out by the vote in June. Last election, which was five
*09:19.940- 09:26.520* :  years ago, we saw that the voter participation rate was at 67%. I've just come from a press conference
*09:26.520- 09:31.480* :  with the election commission. One of their goals for this particular election is actually to further
*09:32.000- 09:37.860* :  increase that participation rate. What they're trying to do is to really make sure that they
*09:37.860- 09:44.860* :  increase the voter participation especially among young people, new voters and among women.
*09:45.160- 09:51.280* :  Of course, the north is absolutely dominated by Prime Minister Modi's BJP party. But if you look
*09:51.280- 09:56.840* :  at the south and other areas in the country, there is actually a regional opposition to the Prime
*09:56.840- 10:02.880* :  Minister. So whether the increased voter participation will benefit him, it really depends on where
*10:02.880- 10:09.420* :  these voters are coming from. Samira Hussein. So it seems to be over three months after an Indian
*10:09.420- 10:15.960* :  cargo ship was captured by Somali pirates. The Indian Navy has taken it back. All 35 pirates,
*10:15.960- 10:21.700* :  it says, were forced to surrender. And the 17 crew were rescued without injury. With more details,
*10:21.700- 10:27.900* :  here's our South Asia Regional Editor, and Barassan Ethirajan. The cargo ship ruined was seized
*10:27.900- 10:33.820* :  off the coast of Somalia in December. And since then, it was being tracked by international maritime
*10:34.300- 10:39.980* :  forces. The Indian Rescue Operation involved drones and marine commandos dropped from the air.
*10:39.980- 10:47.680* :  It was conducted almost 2,600 kilometers away from the Indian coast. Since January, the Indian Navy
*10:47.680- 10:54.820* :  has intercepted two hijacked vessels, rescuing 38 crew members kidnapped by pirates. India has
*10:54.820- 11:00.580* :  deployed at least a dozen warships along with other nations to provide security against pirates
*11:00.580- 11:07.100* :  in the Western Indian Ocean this year. India is not part of the US-led task force protecting
*11:07.100- 11:13.320* :  vessels from houthi attacks in the Red Sea. But an expert said, the Indian Navy was doing classic
*11:13.320- 11:16.880* :  police work patrolling the Northern and Western Arabian Sea.
*11:17.580- 11:24.260* :  And Barassan Ethirajan. It's sometimes known as Hollywood on the Nile. The Egyptian film industry
*11:24.260- 11:30.060* :  pumps out hundreds of productions every year, watched across the Arab world. In fact, that comparison
*11:30.060- 11:35.500* :  with Hollywood is a little misleading, as the first silent films were made in Egypt at the end
*11:35.500- 11:40.740* :  of the 19th century, before all those West Coast American movie makers got in on the act.
*11:41.400- 11:46.080* :  In recent years, television production has also become prominent in Egypt. Here's an excerpt
*11:46.080- 11:51.720* :  from the epic series Al Moilam about a man seeking revenge after he was wrongfully imprisoned.
*12:04.120- 12:09.160* :  Al Moilam is just one of the TV shows which was filmed at the Al Akram Studios in Cairo,
*12:09.160- 12:14.920* :  which has now been destroyed by fire. And this is not merely a blow for Egypt. Al Akram is one of the
*12:14.920- 12:21.340* :  largest and oldest film studios in the world. Arab affairs editors Abastin Asha told me first
*12:21.340- 12:26.880* :  about the extent of the damage. It was a very, very big fire, spectacular images of it, which
*12:27.160- 12:32.280* :  Egyptians woke up to earlier this morning. The Prime Minister, the Culture Minister, have all
*12:32.300- 12:36.860* :  been to visit the site. This is a big area. There's three studios there. One of the studios
*12:36.860- 12:41.340* :  appears to have been destroyed. Importantly, though, the archives of Culture Minister said,
*12:41.340- 12:47.620* :  are still intact. In fact, that clip you played of Al Moilam back is what was being filmed just
*12:47.680- 12:53.080* :  hours before this fire hits a huge production for this Ramadan. It's actually going out as we
*12:53.080- 12:59.260* :  speak now. So it's a big fire that will stop Al Akram from some of the production's doing but
*12:59.260- 13:03.840* :  it's not going to wipe it out for good. For those who don't know, just tell us a bit about why
*13:03.840- 13:08.460* :  this studio is so important, not just in Egypt, but certainly across the Arab world.
*13:08.620- 13:14.260* :  It's one of a crop of studios in Cairo and around there which appeared over the past 50,
*13:14.260- 13:18.940* :  60 years. This one goes about 80 years. It was set up in 1944 by two Greek businessmen.
*13:19.360- 13:25.440* :  So it saw the great flourishing of the Egyptian film industry when Egypt was the center of the
*13:25.440- 13:29.760* :  Arab world culturally. For example, Yusuf Shaheen, one of the great Egyptian directors and actors,
*13:29.940- 13:34.900* :  he produced one of his most iconic, one of his most legendary films there, Cairo Station.
*13:49.020- 13:55.200* :  Okay, so that's the past. Egypt's cinema was still great, great guns. Do you think with Al Akram
*13:55.200- 14:00.440* :  suffering such a terrible damage will they be able to continue? I mean, is that it for production
*14:00.540- 14:05.820* :  there? Well, I mean, the golden age is over of Egyptian cinema. We're talking for 60s,
*14:05.820- 14:12.460* :  for 70s, the 80s. What is replaced it is for TV industry and that is still a major part of what
*14:12.460- 14:18.000* :  Egypt produces. Al Akram, I'm sure, will continue in one form and other. There are other studios,
*14:18.000- 14:22.960* :  which perhaps more important than Al Akram these days. And we've seen beyond Egypt. We've seen
*14:22.960- 14:26.860* :  now in Lebanon, in Syria and other countries. They are just as important in the production,
*14:26.860- 14:31.780* :  not just at those series during Ramadan, but a film. So Egypt still is very important,
*14:31.780- 14:35.980* :  but it's not standing astride above everything else in the Arab world culturally.
*14:36.640- 14:42.500* :  Sebastian Asha, now to a new play opening here in London on Sunday, which is unique in many ways.
*14:43.020- 14:49.060* :  It has the arresting and rather provocative title, Mad Women, the life and death of three women
*14:49.060- 14:54.960* :  artists living with bipolar. Here's a flavor. I'm so sorry for breaking your heart like this.
*15:01.500- 15:11.960* :  One day, I won't be here. I'm tired. I'm tired of hospitals, of drugs, of waking up in the middle of the night in pain.
*15:15.080- 15:19.220* :  What if today becomes that day? I'll be gone.
*15:21.300- 15:25.040* :  The play is inspired by the lives of three female Latin American artists,
*15:25.040- 15:31.000* :  Frida Kahlo, Violeta Para, and Judith Marquez, and it charts their mental health looking at the way
*15:31.000- 15:36.200* :  women and men are often treated differently when it comes to mental illness. The play's author and
*15:36.200- 15:42.220* :  director of the new production, Costanza Ola Chami, told Leastu Set what made her tackle this subject.
*15:43.040- 15:50.520* :  I got interested in mental health because of my own experience. I had a crisis in some point
*15:50.520- 15:57.680* :  of my life and my way to deal with it and cope with it was writing and I always say that I write
*15:57.680- 16:04.380* :  not to be mad. I wrote the first monologue. These are three monologues. The first monologue about
*16:04.380- 16:10.500* :  Violeta Para because she is Chilean and I am Chilean and she was a pioneer in folk music and
*16:10.500- 16:16.900* :  many of the things, but also had a very hectic life and I was always interested in her life because
*16:17.820- 16:25.300* :  for many more conservative Chileans it was like, yes, she was like from misquiz and judging her.
*16:25.420- 16:32.260* :  Judging her and I was like, no, I mean, I want to do some research. So I wrote this monologue which
*16:32.260- 16:39.260* :  is a fictional portrayal of her life and death is basically a journey. I opened it and I had an
*16:39.260- 16:45.500* :  amazing reaction from the female audience and many women approached me every night and said like,
*16:45.500- 16:50.840* :  well, thank you. This is the first time that we see women's mental health portrayed in a way
*16:50.840- 16:57.880* :  that is not patronizing or stereotypes or just condescending. So it's honest. And you would
*16:57.880- 17:04.900* :  want to choose someone who is well-known, Frida Kahlo, Mexican, artist, very successful but
*17:04.900- 17:10.860* :  known to have mental health issues and Judith Marquez. So all three women are artists but they
*17:10.860- 17:18.560* :  had mental health issues of a kind. Yes, if you read Frida Kahlo's letters. So I read all her
*17:18.560- 17:25.940* :  letters and there's a big book and also her diary. And yes, you can see there were mental health
*17:26.000- 17:33.560* :  challenges for her. She wrote to her therapist even in some episodes of her life. She was the press
*17:33.560- 17:39.900* :  many times but she was also in this mood that she was like kind of big personality. It's basically a
*17:39.900- 17:48.760* :  journey through their art to say, hey, you society, you have judged us. If a man artist has a
*17:48.760- 17:55.320* :  mental health condition, he's a genius. Leave him because he is in a creative moment. Yes, they
*17:55.320- 17:59.400* :  often say, oh, you have to be a bit mad to be really, really brilliant and it's in his positive.
*18:00.120- 18:06.180* :  Exactly. But for women, they are hysterical, you know. So you have many different eyes on this,
*18:06.180- 18:12.980* :  your Chilean, but you live in London. Is this a Latin American portrayal? Is the way these issues
*18:12.980- 18:18.880* :  are treated different in that region than they are say here in Britain or America or any other
*18:18.880- 18:24.440* :  parts of the world or are the universal. I think they're universal and that's why I was surprised
*18:24.440- 18:31.960* :  that people approached me when the first monologue was open because yes, Latin America has high
*18:31.960- 18:38.540* :  levels of domestic violence and femicides killing of women by men. Yeah, by their partners usually.
*18:38.540- 18:44.420* :  But the topics are universal. Costanza Ola Chami speaking to Listo Set.
*18:47.120- 18:52.020* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast. This is a dream come true. I have been
*18:52.020- 18:55.940* :  asked about Glastonbury now for years and it's finally coming together.
*18:56.540- 19:00.840* :  The country star, Shania Twain, prepares to wow Glastonbury, one of the world's biggest
*19:00.840- 19:01.980* :  live music events.
*19:10.140- 19:15.760* :  A court in Hong Kong has handed down prison sentences of up to seven years to a group of 12 people
*19:16.380- 19:19.600* :  all convicted in connection with the storming of the city's legislature.
*19:20.180- 19:24.760* :  It happened at the height of anti-government protests five years ago, most have been found guilty
*19:24.760- 19:27.940* :  of rioting. There's Martin Yett reports from Hong Kong.
*19:28.500- 19:33.240* :  Families and friends were seen whipping in the public gallery as the convicted protesters
*19:33.240- 19:39.780* :  were led away by prison guards. Those sentenced included the actor Gregory Wong and the former
*19:39.780- 19:46.240* :  head of Hong Kong University Students Union, Elvy Assoon. Of them were among hundreds of people
*19:46.240- 19:52.500* :  who broke into the legislature on the 1st of July 2019. Some protesters sprayed political
*19:52.500- 19:58.300* :  slogans on the walls and tore up copies of the city's mini constitution. The judge
*19:58.300- 20:04.040* :  sat these acts did not just cause physical damage but also challenged the rule of law
*20:04.360- 20:06.560* :  and undermined the government's integrity.
*20:07.300- 20:13.520* :  Martin Yett. It's usually obvious why women are arrested in Iran, not wearing the right clothes,
*20:13.520- 20:18.500* :  for example, can easily get you locked up. Or being somewhere with a man who's not a member of
*20:18.500- 20:24.560* :  your family. What's often not clear is why someone's arrested at a particular time. Take
*20:24.560- 20:30.800* :  Sidiqe Vasmaki, for example, a prominent scholar of Islam and political activists. She's frequently
*20:30.800- 20:36.800* :  appeared in public without the hijab. Yet on Saturday morning, she was suddenly taken into custody.
*20:37.340- 20:43.060* :  Sebastian Azari from the BBC's monitoring service told me this could be because of shifts in Iran's
*20:43.060- 20:48.900* :  government rather than anything Ms. Vasmaki had done recently. The arrest and rates that take place
*20:48.900- 20:55.080* :  depend usually on the political environment, the social situation on which the intelligence
*20:55.080- 21:00.720* :  ministry and the revolutionary guard usually decide. But there is a certain fact here that they
*21:00.720- 21:05.800* :  didn't do this before the elections, which happened earlier this month because the Iranian
*21:05.800- 21:10.780* :  government actually wanted to heat up the environment for the elections and did not want to
*21:10.780- 21:15.680* :  continue the crackdown, which has been going on over the past two years, just trying to appease
*21:15.680- 21:22.280* :  the society and project a more relaxed image of the environment. So the arrest today is probably an
*21:22.280- 21:28.200* :  indication that this long arm could reach anyone. And it's not just about the ordinary members
*21:28.200- 21:35.440* :  of the public. Someone with prominence, someone who is a jurist and can challenge the religious
*21:35.440- 21:42.060* :  aspects of this controversial hijab dress code could also be arrested and cannot be spared
*21:42.060- 21:47.460* :  in this crackdown. This showdown, if you will, has been happening on the streets because the
*21:47.460- 21:53.240* :  Iranian women, especially after the outbreak of the unrest, have found themselves in a better
*21:53.240- 21:59.160* :  situation in terms of expressing their courage. Despite all the repressive measures that the
*21:59.160- 22:04.720* :  ruling system has adopted, they continue to show this defiance and the ruling establishment is
*22:04.720- 22:10.640* :  finding itself in a state of tug of war with them. And it's somehow deadlock. On the one hand,
*22:10.640- 22:15.340* :  we have these women who are out on the streets. On the other, we have partliners who are working
*22:15.340- 22:22.380* :  on a bill, which is aimed at imposing a new set of laws to actually establish the rule of hijab
*22:22.380- 22:28.640* :  in the society. Sabaz Nazari from the BBC's monitoring service. In Britain, the devolved government
*22:28.640- 22:33.640* :  in Wales is set to be led by a black politician for the first time. After Vaughn guessing,
*22:33.640- 22:38.780* :  was elected as leader of the local Labour Party, he's expected to succeed Mark Dreyford as
*22:38.780- 22:44.260* :  first minister once he officially steps down next week. Mr Gaffing had this reaction.
*22:44.840- 22:50.880* :  Today, we turn a page in the book of our nation's history, a history that we write together,
*22:51.460- 22:56.720* :  not just because I have the honour of becoming the first black leader in any European country,
*22:56.720- 23:01.860* :  but because a generational dial has jumped too. And I want us to use this moment
*23:01.860- 23:06.520* :  at a starting point for a more confident march into the future.
*23:07.000- 23:10.960* :  Gareth Lewis now looks back on Mr Gaffing's rise to the top of the Welsh government.
*23:11.600- 23:16.360* :  Humphrey Vaughn, Ab David Gaffing's route to the Art Deco First Minister's office,
*23:16.360- 23:21.760* :  looking out over a park in central Cardiff, has been an unusual one. He was born in Zambia
*23:21.900- 23:28.200* :  in 1974. His father from Ogmore, by senior Bridgend, was a vet and his mother as Zambian chicken
*23:28.200- 23:32.440* :  farmer. When he was two, the family moved to the UK after his father was offered a job in
*23:32.440- 23:37.620* :  Abergavelli, but when he arrived with his black family, that offer was withdrawn. They moved
*23:37.620- 23:42.220* :  to Dorset instead, and later Mr Gaffing went to university in Cardiff and Aberystwyth.
*23:42.440- 23:47.900* :  This is where he first came to political prominence. Speaking to the BBC in the late 1990s,
*23:48.180- 23:49.960* :  about his opposition to tuition fees.
*23:50.160- 23:53.960* :  Tuition fees are a detriment to access. They do damage actors. They do put people off.
*23:54.140- 23:58.520* :  Vaughn gaffing's early experiences have shaped his politics. As the first black leader of a
*23:58.520- 24:03.620* :  European nation, he's spoken eloquently about the message his election would send. He knows he
*24:03.620- 24:08.040* :  says what it's like to experience prejudice and have your place in the community questioned.
*24:08.040- 24:11.920* :  One of his aims is that nobody in Wales should feel that way again.
*24:11.920- 24:18.480* :  Gareth Lewis, imagine for a moment you are a king or queen you spend considerable time
*24:18.520- 24:22.880* :  wandering the globe, visiting other countries where you are fated by the great and the good.
*24:23.620- 24:29.060* :  And this inevitably involves a state banquet. Now, where would you expect the finest of these
*24:29.060- 24:34.540* :  to be held? You might guess it would be France, and the French have in the past laid on spectacular
*24:34.540- 24:40.420* :  feasts, with more courses than many people managed to eat in a week. But those days are it seems
*24:40.420- 24:46.040* :  passed, with French banquets becoming rather more frugal. We know about this trend because an
*24:46.040- 24:51.620* :  auction is being held of menus from French banquets down the ages. At Barris Correspondent,
*24:51.620- 24:58.180* :  Hugh Scofield, tell me first how things used to be. You know, 150 years ago when this collection
*24:58.180- 25:03.760* :  was first begun, or when the oldest menus come from, the state dinners were absolutely
*25:03.760- 25:09.380* :  unrecognizable from today. They would have been masses of dishes of a very heavy and
*25:09.380- 25:16.140* :  undigestible to today's palettes kind. And gradually over the years that has changed,
*25:16.480- 25:20.240* :  just before the Second World War, when, for example, King George VI of England and
*25:20.240- 25:23.940* :  the woman, his wife, who became the Queen Mother went, they had a banquet which was already
*25:23.940- 25:30.600* :  scaled down from the early standard, and that still had 15 courses. So there's been a gradual
*25:30.600- 25:36.020* :  move away from these very, very heavy, stodgy, excessive meals, where I think people really
*25:36.020- 25:41.780* :  expected to take a little tiny portion of all of this, a ray of different foods down to what is
*25:41.780- 25:48.800* :  a far more simple and modern taste, where they, in the banquet given by Macron to King Charles,
*25:48.800- 25:53.640* :  the third day, we know there were just four courses, there was fish, main course, cheese,
*25:53.640- 26:00.060* :  and ghetto, all extremely beautiful, beautifully prepared and so on. But that was it. Compare that
*26:00.060- 26:05.740* :  to, as I say, 1938, where you know, you get down to the Trambaldad, Caifacella, Taleron,
*26:05.740- 26:09.500* :  fourth course, and you're only a third of the way through the meal. So what's going on? I mean,
*26:09.500- 26:13.900* :  is this the French worried about the bill for the food at the end of it? Why are they becoming?
*26:13.900- 26:17.520* :  Well, I'm just a bit more food. So changing taste, it certainly would have been in
*26:17.520- 26:22.040* :  vastly more expensive to prepare all that stuff, but I mean, it's just not done like that anywhere
*26:22.040- 26:27.460* :  anymore. I mean, the nobility, the sort of families that would have done this in a kind of
*26:27.460- 26:32.380* :  ordinary way have disappeared, it's not part of modern life. And on top of that, of course,
*26:32.380- 26:37.800* :  there are all sorts of new considerations about health, about what's good for you, about what
*26:37.800- 26:42.460* :  the purpose of a meal is. I mean, back then, people would have sat around for hours, and you
*26:42.460- 26:47.600* :  could have lasted three or four or five hours, a big banquet. Nowadays, you know, much less time,
*26:47.600- 26:54.220* :  and much more of a focus on the quality and on the sort of health of the recipient so safe
*26:54.220- 27:00.620* :  the banquet. Huseko Field. The Canadian singer, Shania Twain, has joined a select group of musicians.
*27:00.620- 27:05.600* :  It's been announced she'll play the Legends slot on the famous Pyramid stage at the Class
*27:05.600- 27:10.860* :  to Bre music festival in the west of England. Among her predecessors to receive this honour,
*27:10.860- 27:17.100* :  a Johnny Cash, Kylie Minogue, Dolly Parton and Diana Ross, all have barced in the afternoon sun
*27:17.100- 27:23.400* :  shine, or sometimes pouring rain, in front of tens of thousands of fans. The BBC's Joe Wiley has
*27:23.400- 27:28.360* :  been to more Glastonbury festivals than most, and has been looking back at the Legends slot.
*27:35.900- 27:40.320* :  The Legends slot, I think, has just evolved, so there was a moment, maybe 20 years ago,
*27:40.480- 27:45.420* :  and it was this certain slot where heritage artists who were revered and they were established and
*27:45.420- 27:50.140* :  much loved by so many different people, and it just felt right that they sat nicely on a Sunday
*27:50.140- 27:54.320* :  afternoon. It fitted the mood and it fitted the tempo of the weekend. Everyone was a little bit,
*27:54.400- 27:59.160* :  you know, exhausted from dancing and partying for the entire weekend, so to have Johnny Cash
*27:59.260- 28:02.960* :  playing in front of you, just serenading you on a Sunday afternoon felt absolutely right.
*28:13.480- 28:17.720* :  I remember when Dolly Parton played, and there was a crowd of a hundred thousand people,
*28:17.720- 28:22.080* :  the biggest crowd I've ever seen, apart from Elton last year, and they all turned up to just
*28:22.080- 28:27.220* :  worship at the altar of Dolly into sing along all her greatest hits, and she hummed it up brilliantly.
*28:35.300- 28:39.460* :  Quite a lot of the artists who play in the Legends slot are American, so I don't think Glastonbury
*28:39.460- 28:43.300* :  is translated particularly through to them what it's all about, so when Lionel Ritchie turned up,
*28:43.680- 28:48.880* :  and he saw this big field of festival go as like enormous, and he'd walks out on stage,
*28:48.900- 28:54.020* :  and he's played to anybody and everybody, hasn't he? But his experience, he at one point actually
*28:54.020- 28:59.680* :  said, Glastonbury, what the hell is going on here? And I was really lucky to just catch him moments
*28:59.680- 29:07.380* :  after he'd walked off stage. That was as good as it gets, even after all the years of me performing.
*29:08.480- 29:13.680* :  When a crowd takes over like that, and shows that much love, and they know every song, and then my,
*29:14.840- 29:19.340* :  when I saw my face in every imaginable form, it was the perfect show.
*29:20.620- 29:25.060* :  There's been so much speculation about who is going to be the legend this year, ranging from
*29:25.060- 29:30.340* :  Shaka Khan, Barbara Streisand, Cher, everybody wanted to know who is going to be on that Sunday afternoon,
*29:30.340- 29:35.920* :  and it has been revealed to be Shania Twain, and it's fair to say that she is wildly excited.
*29:36.420- 29:42.000* :  This is a dream come true. I have been asked about Glastonbury now for years, and it's finally
*29:42.000- 29:48.400* :  coming together. I'm packing my willies, and my ringcoat, and of course, my cowboy hat. So,
*29:49.000- 29:54.460* :  I'll see you in the beautiful summer set, countryside. This summer can't wait. This is huge.
*29:55.140- 29:59.540* :  All of my life, I'm so excited. Man, I'll see you like a woman.
*30:09.200- 30:13.860* :  Shania Twain, ending that report by Joe Wiley, and this year's festival runs for five days,
*30:14.460- 30:15.220* :  at the end of June.
