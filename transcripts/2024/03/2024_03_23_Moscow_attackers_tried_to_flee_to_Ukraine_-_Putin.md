*02:07.280- 02:11.200* :  I'm Nick Wells and at 14 hours GMT on Saturday the 23rd of March,
*02:11.200- 02:12.420* :  these are our main stories.
*02:13.000- 02:18.820* :  At least 115 people are now known to have died in an attack on a concert hall near Moscow.
*02:19.320- 02:23.120* :  President Putin says the attackers were arrested heading for Ukraine.
*02:23.940- 02:28.800* :  During a visit to the Egypt Gaza border, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres
*02:29.220- 02:32.540* :  makes a renewed and impassioned call for an immediate ceasefire.
*02:34.960- 02:39.440* :  Also in this podcast we head to Bolivia where people are urged to go into lockdown,
*02:39.480- 02:41.980* :  but not because of a COVID outbreak.
*02:45.580- 02:48.580* :  Just before we recorded this podcast, President Putin
*02:48.580- 02:53.000* :  gave a TV address, responding to the concert hall attack on Friday,
*02:53.620- 02:55.840* :  in which at least 115 people were killed.
*02:59.020- 03:03.720* :  All those who were shooting and killing people were found and detained.
*03:03.780- 03:07.240* :  They tried to hide and were moving towards Ukraine,
*03:07.240- 03:10.740* :  where according to preliminary information for them,
*03:11.100- 03:15.760* :  from the Ukrainian side, a window to cross the border had been prepared.
*03:16.560- 03:18.980* :  All together, 11 people were detained.
*03:19.020- 03:24.860* :  Mr. Putin said there would be a national day of mourning on Sunday to commemorate the people
*03:24.860- 03:27.560* :  who died in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
*03:27.680- 03:31.400* :  The Islamic State Group said it was behind the attack.
*03:31.900- 03:35.180* :  Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg is outside the concert hall.
*03:35.980- 03:38.160* :  The mood is very somber here, I have to say.
*03:38.520- 03:43.280* :  All morning people have been bringing flowers, laying flowers and a makeshift shrine,
*03:43.940- 03:49.580* :  standing, trying to comprehend the scale of this, this attack that has blamed so many lives.
*03:49.580- 03:55.320* :  And that 115 figure that is not the final death toll, it's expected to be higher than that.
*03:55.800- 04:00.140* :  Some people who've come here today told me that they found out what happened on the news.
*04:00.140- 04:01.380* :  In fact, they had to come.
*04:01.800- 04:08.980* :  But I spoke to one woman who was here last night at the rock concert and managed to escape and
*04:08.980- 04:14.000* :  survived. She told me it was hard to find the words to describe what she went through.
*04:14.300- 04:20.860* :  She said that all day today she was replaying in her eyes and in her ears the nightmare that she
*04:20.860- 04:26.420* :  went through. The FSB Russia's domestic security service says it has arrested 11 people,
*04:26.420- 04:32.300* :  including four government. It has claimed that the government planned to cross the border into
*04:32.300- 04:38.060* :  Ukraine. Now that FSB statement put together with what pro-Kremlin commentators have been saying
*04:38.060- 04:44.360* :  suggests to me that Moscow is keen to point the finger at Kiev. Even though Ukraine says it had
*04:44.360- 04:50.320* :  nothing to do with this attack and the Islamic State has already claimed responsibility for it.
*04:50.920- 04:56.940* :  Steve Rosenberg, or Sergei Markov, is a former member of Parliament for Vladimir Putin's
*04:57.140- 05:02.100* :  United Russia Party and a supporter of the president. Julian Wariker asked him for his
*05:02.100- 05:09.360* :  reaction to the attack. I visit this Korkos city hall many times and it was a great,
*05:09.360- 05:15.060* :  very, very big tourist center, one of the biggest in Russia, in Europe, I think.
*05:15.780- 05:22.000* :  And also I visited a few times this concert hall. And of course, this is a very big tragedy.
*05:22.640- 05:25.980* :  Thank you speaking. In Russia, here, absolute majority of the people,
*05:25.980- 05:32.780* :  strongly believes that this terrorist attack has been organized by Ukrainian regime and also
*05:33.300- 05:38.520* :  some rumors and the formation from American intelligence areas saying that Islamic State,
*05:38.520- 05:41.660* :  but it's really difficult to believe in this version.
*05:41.820- 05:46.060* :  Well, let me just go there for a moment if I may because this Islamic State group has claimed
*05:46.060- 05:51.100* :  it carried out the attack, but you're saying that you don't know. Well, that's what they've claimed.
*05:51.100- 05:53.420* :  No, no, no, it's wrong confirmation. Okay.
*05:53.440- 06:01.480* :  It was fake news, organized from the resources close to Ukraine. That Islamic State claimed that
*06:01.480- 06:07.240* :  they take responsibility. No, and the official resources, they said, but this also
*06:07.240- 06:13.280* :  old formal have been used by Islamic State, you know, a few years ago have been used for
*06:13.280- 06:20.000* :  these fake news. Right. So just so that I can be clear, indeed, just so that I can be clear
*06:20.000- 06:24.600* :  with people listening to the conversation. Ukraine has denied any involvement.
*06:24.600- 06:31.480* :  I should also add that the US says that there is no reason to doubt that Islamic State claim,
*06:31.480- 06:37.520* :  because it says it warned Russia of a potential attack on, quote, large gatherings in Moscow
*06:38.240- 06:45.420* :  earlier this month. That is true, is it not? We know that Islamic radicals didn't attack Russia
*06:45.420- 06:52.700* :  during many years. Also, you should know the culture for Muslims. It's Ramadan. It's holy
*06:52.700- 06:58.160* :  months right now. And to organize the rest of the attack during the holy months, and specifically,
*06:58.160- 07:07.020* :  it was Friday, but Friday is holy day for Muslims. They are praying exactly those time to imagine
*07:07.020- 07:14.520* :  that the people who believe that they are radical Muslims and they sharply violated the
*07:14.520- 07:20.540* :  rules of holy months Ramadan, and holy Friday is difficult to imagine.
*07:21.400- 07:26.800* :  It seems the assumption from the Kremlin at least is that Ukraine was behind the attacks,
*07:26.800- 07:31.580* :  but our security correspondent Gordon Carrera says that position is hard to defend.
*07:32.360- 07:38.360* :  So far, the claim from IS that they were behind it is impossible to independently verify.
*07:38.360- 07:43.680* :  The US, though, say they've got no reason to doubt it, and it does look as if they had some
*07:43.680- 07:49.180* :  kind of intelligence about a possible attack linked to IS in recent weeks, back on March 7th,
*07:49.180- 07:54.320* :  the US issued a warning. So I think a lot of signs point in that direction. The other reason
*07:54.320- 08:00.440* :  would be the nature of the attack, this kind of marauding gunman targeting as many civilians as
*08:00.440- 08:05.300* :  possible. That is a signature, if you like, of the way that group IS operates. We saw something
*08:05.300- 08:10.140* :  very similar, for instance, at a concert venue in Paris in November 2015 at the Bataclan.
*08:10.680- 08:15.800* :  So that is much more typical of a kind of IS operation. Now, it is true, of course,
*08:15.800- 08:21.140* :  Ukraine has operated inside Russia. It's had small groups carry out attacks. It's even carried out
*08:21.140- 08:27.080* :  a targeted bombing against an individual its thought in Moscow, but not this kind of wide-scale
*08:27.080- 08:32.100* :  indiscriminate attacks against civilians. And so that wouldn't make sense in terms of past
*08:32.100- 08:37.920* :  behavior. So I think all those signs do point towards ISIS, even though we can't at this stage
*08:37.920- 08:43.900* :  be absolutely sure about that. And the indication from Sergei Markov there that a lot of people in
*08:43.900- 08:48.960* :  Russia feel that Ukraine was behind it, perhaps a predictable reaction? Yes, and I think you could
*08:48.960- 08:54.940* :  sense almost immediately after the attack took place that the context of Ukraine was going to be
*08:54.940- 09:00.340* :  important in this, because you had senior Russian officials saying, if this is Ukraine, the retribution
*09:00.340- 09:04.940* :  would be terrible. You had some people in Ukraine, first of all, suggesting, well, this could be a
*09:04.940- 09:09.660* :  provocation by Russia to justify further attacks on Ukraine. And then you had the Ukrainians
*09:09.660- 09:15.140* :  deny it very strongly from a presidential adviser, and you had Washington. Ukraine's allies say
*09:15.140- 09:19.880* :  there's no indication that Ukraine was involved. So clearly, there was concern that this could play
*09:19.880- 09:25.480* :  into that Ukraine conflict. Either way, there is likely to be, well, certainly in the short-term
*09:25.480- 09:30.960* :  security measures will be up to around Moscow and around the country. One imagines in the medium
*09:30.960- 09:35.120* :  term as well, things may well change there. Yes, in the short-term certainly there's increased
*09:35.120- 09:39.720* :  security at sensitive sites, at railway stations, airports, mass gatherings have been cancelled
*09:39.720- 09:45.120* :  over the weekend. And yes, you would expect Russia to be on a much higher alert about this.
*09:45.440- 09:50.100* :  It is true, though. They have had waves of such attacks in the past, targeting things like
*09:50.100- 09:55.400* :  Moscow Metro. We've seen Russian airliners blown up by bombs back in 2015, and other incidents
*09:55.400- 10:00.600* :  in the past, if you go back to Chechnya in the early 2000s, including seizures at theaters.
*10:00.600- 10:05.880* :  So Russia, unfortunately, does have a history of having been targeted in this way, but I think
*10:05.880- 10:10.960* :  the nature of this will come as a shock to a lot of people and lead to major questions about
*10:10.960- 10:15.900* :  security, how it could have happened, and that question about whether there were some kind of
*10:15.900- 10:21.500* :  warnings potentially from the US, and if they were acted on. Gordon Carrera, and later in the
*10:21.500- 10:26.480* :  podcast, will look more closely at the likelihood of Islamist involvement in the attack
*10:26.480- 10:31.160* :  with our specialist from the BBC's monitoring service. Some other news now.
*10:31.660- 10:36.460* :  The revelation that the Princess of Wales is currently undergoing treatment for cancer has
*10:36.460- 10:41.720* :  prompted widespread sympathy from around the world. She made the announcement in a video shared
*10:41.720- 10:47.300* :  on social media. Speaking directly to the camera, she said her priority was protecting her children.
*10:47.840- 10:51.540* :  Having William, by my side, is a great source of comfort and reassurance to
*10:52.520- 10:56.340* :  as is the love, support, and kindness that has been shown by so many of you.
*10:57.020- 11:02.180* :  It means so much to us both. We hope that you'll understand that as a family,
*11:02.820- 11:07.120* :  we now need some time, space, and privacy while I complete my treatment.
*11:07.880- 11:12.220* :  The announcement comes after weeks of social media speculation about the Princess's health.
*11:12.220- 11:17.240* :  The BBC's Martha Carney has been speaking to David Yelland, former editor of the
*11:17.240- 11:23.160* :  Sun newspaper here in the UK, and first to the former communications secretary to Queen Elizabeth
*11:23.160- 11:30.200* :  Simon Lewis. It was so powerful, so brave, so dignified. I cannot think of another occasion where
*11:30.200- 11:34.080* :  a member of the Royal family has spoken directly about their health in that way. It's unprecedented.
*11:34.120- 11:38.340* :  It was just a magnificent piece of communications if I can put it that way.
*11:39.120- 11:43.740* :  And also the way that she was talking, David, about the need to protect her children,
*11:43.740- 11:48.480* :  and bad enough to have to tell your children that anyway, but knowing that how quickly it's
*11:48.480- 11:52.240* :  going to go around the world in terms of publicity must be an added pressure.
*11:52.720- 11:57.760* :  I think it was an act of huge personal courage. The fact that it was shot on Wednesday by a BBC
*11:57.760- 12:03.320* :  Studios team and didn't appear until Friday night shows that the powers have perhaps learned
*12:03.320- 12:08.160* :  that trusting a third party is the way to go with these communications. They didn't film it on
*12:08.160- 12:15.220* :  on their iPhone. There's not a single person in a conspiracy theory-filled social media world
*12:15.220- 12:22.200* :  that doesn't think this is totally authentic. And was it because of all that speculation Simon that
*12:22.200- 12:26.860* :  she had to go public with this message, something that you'd imagined certainly for previous
*12:26.860- 12:29.780* :  generations, for most people around the country, they'd be able to keep quiet?
*12:30.720- 12:34.640* :  Let's be honest, there has been a frenzy over the last few weeks, and I do think there are
*12:34.640- 12:39.700* :  lessons to be learned. I mean, the social media world, even the photograph that they produced that,
*12:39.740- 12:43.060* :  you know, perhaps that was because they felt they had to do something. I think the lesson to be
*12:43.060- 12:48.560* :  learned is still about privacy and the privacy of people, particularly people in prominent
*12:48.560- 12:53.240* :  public positions, not ever having to be forced, I think, to do things they don't want to do,
*12:53.240- 12:57.240* :  because no one ever knows the full picture in a family circumstance.
*12:57.700- 13:01.360* :  I imagine quite a few people may be feeling rather guilty about what they were up to.
*13:01.680- 13:05.440* :  I think so, but I also think it's important for the powers to understand that, I think they do
*13:05.440- 13:10.200* :  understand that this is not a 20th century problem. The newspapers in this country, including
*13:10.200- 13:14.500* :  people like Victoria Newton who's the edge of the sun and the male, have been totally supportive.
*13:15.180- 13:18.900* :  There has been no invasion of privacy from newspapers in a way that,
*13:19.340- 13:24.540* :  effectively Princess Diana, the problem is social media, and the problem that they have experiences
*13:24.540- 13:31.380* :  that a vacuum of months went by, and it was filled by social media, and although it may seem
*13:32.400- 13:37.240* :  perhaps just a tiny bit controversial to say, we're now in March, if we go forward six,
*13:37.240- 13:42.840* :  nine months, that vacuum will open up again, and social media will very quickly come in again, so
*13:43.700- 13:48.060* :  we will need to be updated in some way, maybe something in the summer, something at Christmas,
*13:48.060- 13:51.920* :  there's obviously the Christmas message, and it doesn't have to be Kate, it could be William.
*13:52.460- 13:56.860* :  They're in the vanguard. I think what the communications team at the power is having to deal
*13:56.860- 14:02.080* :  with at the moment. The White House team will be watching, do I know that? Because, you know,
*14:02.080- 14:05.660* :  how do they update on Biden's health and so on, not that he has cancer, but you know what I mean?
*14:05.660- 14:12.220* :  How do you do this? It's a whole new world. That was the former editor of the British Sun newspaper,
*14:12.220- 14:17.300* :  David Yelland, and Queen Elizabeth's former communications secretary Simon Lewis.
*14:20.500- 14:27.100* :  Come me up in the podcast. Some people make my music is dope, some of you see me as like this
*14:27.100- 14:33.920* :  satanic devil, my sexuality, which is like the elephant in the room. A new documentary on the
*14:33.920- 14:43.040* :  controversial rapper Neil Nazx. Where to be a woman is the podcast celebrating the best of women's

*16:41.640- 16:47.560* :  started recording this, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres made a speech at the border
*16:47.560- 16:55.500* :  between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. Here from this crossing, we see the heartbreak and heartlessness
*16:56.040- 17:04.860* :  of it all. A long line of blocked relief trucks on one side of the gates. The long shadow of
*17:04.860- 17:13.940* :  starvation on the other. That is more than tragic. It is a moral outrage. Any further onslaught
*17:14.700- 17:23.080* :  will make things even worse, worse for Palestinian civilians, worse for the hostages,
*17:23.880- 17:30.440* :  and worse for all people of the region. All this demonstrates that it is more than time
*17:31.520- 17:39.680* :  for an immediate ceasefire. I say it again. It is time for an ironcloth commitment by Israel
*17:40.540- 17:47.080* :  for total and feathered access for humanitarian goods throughout Gaza. And in the Ramadan
*17:47.080- 17:54.020* :  spirit of compassion, it is also time for the immediate release of all hostages.
*17:54.860- 17:59.560* :  It's not just food, the civilian population of the Gaza Strip is in dire need of.
*18:00.180- 18:04.800* :  Medical assistance is also urgently needed with hospitals running out of supplies or
*18:04.800- 18:10.260* :  ceasing to function altogether. And now, the first British field hospital has been set up
*18:10.260- 18:15.360* :  there and is aiming to be fully functioning early next week. As our senior international
*18:15.360- 18:20.660* :  correspondent Ola Garen reports, the staff there are busy even before the hospital is fully open.
*18:21.940- 18:27.900* :  We'll have at least 12 patients in each of these rooms. And there are three rooms.
*18:29.680- 18:33.140* :  CEO David Wittick says they're working around the clock.
*18:35.200- 18:40.800* :  When their trucks got held off at the border, they got started with local timber from destroyed
*18:40.800- 18:46.940* :  buildings. It took a lot of negotiation to get land. It took a lot of negotiation to get
*18:46.940- 18:51.560* :  things across the border. It's been a challenge to find staff. It's been a challenge to
*18:51.560- 18:56.660* :  communicate, none of the phones work, none of the internet works and everything somehow has to
*18:56.660- 19:01.260* :  be made to work in order to bring essential urgent life-saving services to people.
*19:03.740- 19:08.420* :  They are already seeing about a hundred outpatients a day at the field hospital
*19:08.420- 19:15.640* :  and expect to double that soon. Doctors are ready to treat everything from minor illnesses to
*19:15.640- 19:24.500* :  gunshot wounds. A surgical team from the age group has already been working in the chaos of
*19:24.500- 19:33.220* :  Alaxa, one of Gaza's main hospitals. Many Palestinians seeking shelter bed down on the floor.
*19:34.020- 19:41.360* :  It's hard to get a trolley through, but a 12-year-old boy called Anas is on his way to surgery.
*19:42.220- 19:48.240* :  He has a broken leg and wounds to his face. We got the patient with the femoral fracture.
*19:48.960- 19:52.420* :  He's a very brave boy, so let's go.
*19:54.480- 20:04.040* :  Anas says he was playing when his neighborhood was bombed. He was injured and his mother and six
*20:04.040- 20:10.520* :  month old baby brother were killed. May God have mercy on their souls, he says.
*20:13.840- 20:21.220* :  Anas's surgery goes well. He will recover, but the team have seen some of the worst that war
*20:21.220- 20:28.880* :  can do. My name is Judith Kendall. I'm an anesthetist. I've worked in many war zones over the past nine
*20:28.880- 20:35.180* :  years and I think what shocks me about this is the number of children injured that we are seeing
*20:36.000- 20:42.980* :  and the extent of those injuries, they are life-changing injuries that the child will have to live with.
*20:46.400- 20:52.580* :  Back at the building site, they know the need is immense, with Gaza's hospitals overwhelmed
*20:52.700- 21:00.920* :  and sometimes under Israeli attack. And if there is a ground invasion of Rafa as Israel is threatening,
*21:01.600- 21:04.300* :  the British field hospital could be crucial.
*21:08.620- 21:14.700* :  All a care in reporting. Now, if you would account people, it does help if they are standing
*21:14.700- 21:20.160* :  still rather milling around, but if you would account an entire country, what do you do then?
*21:20.160- 21:26.300* :  Bolivia is conducting a national census this weekend and to do this it is asking all its
*21:26.300- 21:31.040* :  citizens to stay put. In fact, they have to remain at home, they're not allowed to travel,
*21:31.040- 21:36.720* :  they're not even supposed to drink alcohol. Paul Moss spoke to our America's regional editor,
*21:37.100- 21:43.200* :  Leonardo Russia. It's basically a curfew that goes on from Friday night until Sunday morning
*21:43.200- 21:50.680* :  and you have 900,000 volunteers canvassing people across the country, a long questionnaire with
*21:50.680- 21:56.420* :  many questions and those who are counted or fill in the forms, even after that they'll have to
*21:56.420- 22:01.460* :  stay at home. They can't meet at any clubs, they can't go to the streets and that's the way they
*22:01.460- 22:07.400* :  do it in Bolivia. I don't know any other country that does it that way. Some more remote locations
*22:07.400- 22:13.160* :  will be done on Monday and just they have about three days to do it, but say all shops are closed,
*22:13.160- 22:19.020* :  flights are suspended. Bolivia is a very spread out mountainous country. Do they really think that
*22:19.020- 22:24.760* :  people in small villages at high altitude, they're all obeying the rules and staying in waiting for
*22:24.760- 22:30.160* :  the census person to come and take their details? Well that's interesting because it's crucial for
*22:30.160- 22:35.640* :  them to know where people come from if they're migrants or not. So I think for example if a person
*22:35.640- 22:40.360* :  couldn't go to their home, they have ways of finding that out but you have to try to be as honest
*22:40.360- 22:46.240* :  as possible because what we have here is the whole political and economic implication of that.
*22:46.720- 22:51.200* :  The census is used to determine the allocation from federal government, federal resources
*22:51.200- 22:57.840* :  and also the number of seats in Congress to the nine different regions and you have people in
*22:57.880- 23:03.140* :  the highlands in the main city La Paz where basically the support, the left wing support for
*23:03.140- 23:08.120* :  the government is and you have people in the eastern province of Santa Cruz which is the wealthiest
*23:08.120- 23:13.840* :  province of Bolivia that has experienced an exponential growth of population internal migrants.
*23:14.260- 23:19.500* :  So the whole controversy that we have is that the census should have been held two years ago
*23:19.500- 23:25.860* :  but the opposition on the east side of the country said we should hold it as close to the election
*23:25.860- 23:31.740* :  as possible to reflect internal migration and the government refused to do that. Finally they came
*23:31.740- 23:38.120* :  to the agreement of doing it now. Do Bolivians mostly accept that this is just an unpleasant
*23:38.120- 23:43.620* :  necessity that it's for doing a census or is it an unpopular thing that they have to do?
*23:43.940- 23:48.400* :  I think what amazers everyone is the compliance. I mean I think Bolivians
*23:48.400- 23:54.500* :  that's the way they do it. They accept it and the last time we had a census only 300 people
*23:55.120- 24:00.620* :  were arrested for for breaking the curfew in a population of 12 million people. That's not many.
*24:01.340- 24:07.220* :  That was Leonardo Rossa. Lil Nadex is only 24 years old but he's already one of America's most
*24:07.220- 24:12.440* :  acclaimed and at times controversial rappers. A full length documentary about him is now being
*24:12.440- 24:17.880* :  shown at Flair, the British Film Institute and your festival of gay cinema from around the world.
*24:17.880- 24:24.020* :  It's the European premiere of the movie called Long Live Montero and not to the rapper's real name.
*24:24.620- 24:27.080* :  Vincent Dowd went to meet the men who made the film.
*24:35.080- 24:42.260* :  The former Montero Hill born in Georgia has become a star worldwide as rapper and songwriter Lil Nadex.
*24:42.520- 24:45.100* :  He has millions of followers online.
*24:48.220- 24:55.500* :  He came out as gay when he was 20. The film the BFI have premiered in London is in part a record
*24:55.500- 25:01.740* :  of Lil Nadex's huge energy on stage but it's makers say it's much else besides.
*25:02.820- 25:09.060* :  My name is Carlos Lopez Estrada. I am one of the two directors of Lil Nadex Long Live Montero.
*25:09.260- 25:15.360* :  We knew that we were going to capture a coming of age of swords so we were just there to see how
*25:15.360- 25:21.420* :  an artist goes from being sort of like an intimate bedroom artist to being this sort of like
*25:21.420- 25:26.300* :  very very public performer. That's the intention of the doc to capture that magic that moment.
*25:27.760- 25:34.740* :  Some people make my music is dope. Some people see me as like this satanic devil.
*25:35.900- 25:40.660* :  When I was a kid, my sexuality was like the elephant in the room.
*25:43.180- 25:49.020* :  The co-director is Zach Manuel. He shot some of the extravagantly produced concerts as much
*25:49.020- 25:55.700* :  theater as music event. I think his audience is anyone who struggled with their identity or had
*25:55.700- 26:00.140* :  struggles with expressing themselves as honestly and as truthfully as as they want to.
*26:00.580- 26:06.980* :  His audience is black queerness in the American South and there's like an entire legacy
*26:06.980- 26:11.220* :  of black queer artists from the South that at different times in history have been like
*26:11.480- 26:17.640* :  washed over or have been like pushed back into the closet. It gives people kind of a someone
*26:17.640- 26:21.700* :  to look to to say my story matters. This is my truth as well.
*26:29.380- 26:33.060* :  Videos viewed online by the million have been crucial to his success,
*26:34.000- 26:39.780* :  expensively made and often full of gay imagery. But the most recent Jay Christ was too much
*26:39.780- 26:45.600* :  for some Americans who identified what they regarded as religious mockery and the sexualization
*26:45.600- 26:51.000* :  of the sacred. Lil Nas X posted online an apology of sorts.
*26:51.820- 26:55.960* :  I knew like there would be some upset people or whatnot, you know,
*26:55.960- 27:01.280* :  relations are very sensitive topic for a lot of people. It was literally me saying oh I'm back
*27:01.280- 27:05.660* :  like Jesus like that was like the whole thing. I'm not the first person to dress up as Jesus
*27:05.660- 27:18.140* :  and I won't be the last. Long live Montero is an insight into a performer whose music and mastery
*27:18.140- 27:25.560* :  of social media promise a long career. But filmmaker Carlos Lopez Estrada says Lil Nas X's fans
*27:25.560- 27:31.720* :  see him as more than just a music star. Because of his story because he's a queer black man
*27:31.720- 27:38.080* :  in a world that still isn't fully open to acknowledging the existence of queer black man,
*27:38.100- 27:44.600* :  he's really taking this responsibility to be as open and as vulnerable and as honest as he can
*27:44.600- 27:51.520* :  about his identity, about his struggles. And I think he just became this icon of radical
*27:51.580- 27:58.940* :  vulnerability, radical honesty. But I feel like he matters in a very profound way to a lot of people.
*28:02.620- 28:08.680* :  The filmmaker Carlos Lopez Estrada ending that report by Vincent Doubt. Let's return to our
*28:08.680- 28:14.320* :  top story now. Friday's attack by gunmen on a concert hall in Moscow, which is left at least
*28:14.320- 28:20.720* :  115 people dead. The Islamic State group has admitted being behind the assault. Mina Al-Lami is
*28:20.720- 28:27.400* :  BBC Monitoring's jihadism specialist. So what exactly have I as said? This was a very brief
*28:27.400- 28:33.940* :  and generic claim that was issued by the group's so-called news agency Armak. So this is official,
*28:33.940- 28:39.520* :  this is an official news outlet of I as. And they simply said that soldiers of the caliphate without
*28:39.520- 28:44.720* :  saying how many soldiers of the Islamic State carried out this attack targeting crowds of
*28:44.720- 28:51.120* :  Christians, as I as said, and it said the attackers then fled the scene unharmed and withdrew.
*28:51.120- 28:57.880* :  What we are expecting now is a follow-up statement from IS to give details and to explain which of
*28:57.880- 29:02.880* :  its global branches was responsible for this attack. And this is kind of the norm in terms of its
*29:02.880- 29:08.640* :  media operation. Usually there's an initial claim from Armak and then there is a follow-up claim
*29:08.640- 29:12.960* :  with details from IS. So we're still waiting for those details. And I think everyone around the
*29:12.960- 29:18.540* :  world is asking which of these branches is it the IS KP, the Horasan branch that is focused
*29:18.540- 29:24.320* :  on Afghanistan, or is it actually IS has or claims to have a branch in Russia or in that region
*29:24.320- 29:28.680* :  called the Caucasus branch? Is it that branch that carried out the attack? So we're still waiting
*29:28.680- 29:33.880* :  for those details. But Mina, why would any of these branches want to attack Russia? Russia
*29:34.500- 29:38.620* :  historically in terms of jihadists, it's kind of up there with the U.S. as the main enemy of the
*29:38.620- 29:42.340* :  jihadists and others. They consider all of these countries to be honest. They consider them
*29:42.340- 29:47.760* :  infidel countries, key targets. So in terms of the strategy, I guess Russia doesn't make sense
*29:47.760- 29:52.420* :  right now in terms of what's happening in the world. Why would IS want to attack Russia specifically?
*29:52.420- 29:59.100* :  Now I think personally it's more of an opportunity they happen to currently have operatives in Russia
*29:59.560- 30:04.680* :  who are capable and who are willing. And we know that the Russian authorities killed a number
*30:04.680- 30:10.580* :  of suspected IS affiliates earlier this month in Ingreshetia. And so the group has carried out
*30:10.580- 30:15.300* :  attacks in the past in mainland Russia, very small attacks as well as in Russian republics.
*30:15.560- 30:20.340* :  The way at least for now it was presented last night the claim, simply that the target were
*30:20.340- 30:25.760* :  Christians. But we will have to wait for the full IS claim with details in which the group will
*30:25.760- 30:31.440* :  explain why it carried out this attack. It could be in response to calls earlier this year by the
*30:31.440- 30:37.080* :  leadership for branches all over the world to step up their attacks. The BBC's jihadism expert
*30:37.340- 30:43.480* :  Mina Alami. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News
