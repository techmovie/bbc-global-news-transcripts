*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?

*01:25.160- 01:28.040* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:28.040- 01:31.140* :  the 26th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:31.220- 01:37.360* :  Palestinians welcome a UN Security Council vote demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
*01:37.700- 01:44.860* :  Over 100,000 Palestinians killed and made for this council to vote for humanity to prevail,
*01:45.560- 01:47.080* :  for life to prevail.
*01:47.440- 01:49.320* :  Eleven days after leaving jail,
*01:49.320- 01:51.840* :  Senegal's opposition leader, Bassirou,
*01:51.840- 01:55.360* :  Jomifi, looks set to win the presidential election.
*01:55.900- 01:58.940* :  And Donald Trump is set to face a criminal trial next month
*01:58.940- 02:01.500* :  as his lawyers fail to delay the case.
*02:04.040- 02:05.260* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:05.260- 02:07.940* :  President Putin says radical Islamists
*02:07.940- 02:11.100* :  carried out Friday's deadly attack on a Moscow concert hall,
*02:11.380- 02:14.400* :  but again, links the suspected attackers to Ukraine.
*02:14.720- 02:15.620* :  And...
*02:15.620- 02:18.200* :  If I was Oliver Coleman, I'd be earning a lot more than I am.
*02:18.640- 02:21.700* :  I know of one pay disparity, which is a 12,000-percent difference.
*02:22.160- 02:23.840* :  Both fouls, you'll present that later.
*02:24.100- 02:25.040* :  Oh, gosh. Yes.
*02:25.640- 02:27.560* :  The Oscar-winning actress, Olivia Coleman,
*02:27.560- 02:30.940* :  on the pay gap between male and female actors.
*02:34.960- 02:39.800* :  Could this be a pivotal moment in what is nearly six months of war in Gaza?
*02:40.040- 02:42.980* :  The United Nations Security Council has, for the first time,
*02:43.380- 02:46.740* :  adopted a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire.
*02:47.140- 02:49.720* :  It's the first time the world's top diplomatic body
*02:49.960- 02:51.540* :  has called for a halt to the fighting
*02:51.540- 02:54.000* :  since Israel began its military offensive.
*02:54.560- 02:57.840* :  Critically, Israel's closest ally and military supporter,
*02:57.880- 02:58.760* :  the United States,
*02:59.180- 03:01.000* :  chose not to block the motion.
*03:01.420- 03:05.200* :  Our first report comes from our North America correspondent, John Sudworth.
*03:05.880- 03:07.960* :  After months of diplomatic wrangling,
*03:07.960- 03:09.580* :  geopolitical brinkmanship,
*03:09.580- 03:13.300* :  squabbling over semantics and numerous failed attempts,
*03:13.380- 03:19.100* :  a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza has finally been passed.
*03:19.400- 03:24.540* :  The draft resolution has, I mean, adopted as resolution 2728.
*03:24.680- 03:27.000* :  As well as the call for an immediate ceasefire,
*03:27.000- 03:31.200* :  the resolution demands the release of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas
*03:31.680- 03:34.400* :  and an urgent expansion of humanitarian aid.
*03:35.000- 03:39.280* :  And the applause was assigned that many members felt it was long overdue,
*03:39.280- 03:42.660* :  with France as ambassador to the UN pointing to what he called
*03:42.660- 03:46.220* :  the Security Council's deafening silence on Gaza.
*03:47.220- 03:50.780* :  But the UK, while voting in support, said it regretted
*03:50.780- 03:55.980* :  that the resolution did not explicitly condemn the October 7th attacks by Hamas.
*03:56.740- 04:00.180* :  And it was a theme taken up by the Israeli ambassador, Gila Dard,
*04:00.180- 04:02.200* :  and in his response to the resolution,
*04:02.560- 04:06.200* :  condemning what he called the failure to make the call for a ceasefire
*04:06.200- 04:08.780* :  conditional upon the release of hostages.
*04:09.300- 04:13.320* :  Your demand for a ceasefire not only is not helpful,
*04:14.100- 04:17.560* :  but it undermines the efforts to secure their release.
*04:18.220- 04:24.340* :  It is harmful to these efforts because it gives Hamas terrorists,
*04:24.340- 04:28.500* :  it gives Hamas terrorists the hope to get a ceasefire
*04:28.980- 04:31.020* :  without releasing the hostages.
*04:31.520- 04:34.360* :  Previous resolutions have founded on the vetoes
*04:34.360- 04:36.680* :  of the Security Council's permanent members,
*04:36.700- 04:42.280* :  the US on three occasions and Russia and China wielding theirs just last week.
*04:43.260- 04:46.140* :  But this time in a sign of Washington's growing frustration
*04:46.140- 04:48.480* :  over the way Israelis prosecuting the war,
*04:48.840- 04:51.380* :  the US ambassador, Linda Thomas Greenfield,
*04:51.380- 04:54.340* :  only abstained, allowing the vote to go through.
*04:54.580- 04:57.580* :  We did not agree with everything in the resolution.
*04:57.580- 05:01.780* :  For that reason, we were unfortunately not able to vote yes.
*05:02.680- 05:04.200* :  However, as I've said before,
*05:04.200- 05:07.360* :  we fully support some of the critical objectives
*05:07.840- 05:09.220* :  in this non-binary resolution.
*05:09.800- 05:13.580* :  And we believe it was important for the council to speak out
*05:14.000- 05:16.600* :  and make clear that our ceasefire must,
*05:16.600- 05:20.200* :  any ceasefire must come with the release of hostages.
*05:20.660- 05:22.860* :  Palestine's permanent observer at the UN
*05:22.860- 05:25.480* :  said the resolution now needs to be implemented.
*05:26.100- 05:28.280* :  It needs to be a turning point, he said.
*05:29.180- 05:32.080* :  But with Israel saying it attends to push ahead with the war,
*05:32.080- 05:34.220* :  the vote, while high on symbolism,
*05:34.880- 05:36.820* :  may well turn out to be low on substance.
*05:37.700- 05:39.580* :  The UN vote intensifies the pressure
*05:39.580- 05:42.380* :  on the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*05:42.800- 05:45.560* :  Our international editor Jeremy Bowen is in Jerusalem
*05:45.560- 05:49.020* :  and has this analysis of a key diplomatic moment.
*05:49.680- 05:52.380* :  The US decision not to block the ceasefire resolution
*05:52.380- 05:55.360* :  removes, for now, diplomatic protection from Israel
*05:55.800- 05:57.180* :  at the UN Security Council.
*05:57.720- 06:00.980* :  After the vote, the American ambassador to the Security Council
*06:01.600- 06:03.340* :  called the resolution non-binding.
*06:03.900- 06:05.920* :  Usually, Security Council resolutions
*06:05.920- 06:08.800* :  are considered to carry the force of law.
*06:09.680- 06:12.500* :  For weeks, President Joe Biden and his senior officials
*06:12.500- 06:14.920* :  have indicated that their losing patience
*06:14.920- 06:17.600* :  with the way Israel is fighting the war in Gaza.
*06:18.660- 06:20.880* :  President Biden wants the hostages out
*06:20.880- 06:24.300* :  as well as the destruction of Hamas as a military force.
*06:24.680- 06:26.840* :  But he's been telling Israel to respect
*06:26.840- 06:29.660* :  international humanitarian law, which
*06:29.660- 06:32.300* :  includes an obligation to protect civilians.
*06:33.200- 06:35.820* :  The Israelis deny they block humanitarian aid,
*06:36.160- 06:37.820* :  but the Americans can see the evidence
*06:37.820- 06:39.960* :  that Gaza is on the brink of famine
*06:40.480- 06:44.580* :  with children dying of hunger, a few miles from ample stores
*06:44.580- 06:46.780* :  of food in Israel and Egypt.
*06:47.820- 06:51.240* :  The US-Israel alliance is deep, but at times,
*06:51.240- 06:53.080* :  it is highly dysfunctional.
*06:53.620- 06:56.360* :  Crisis happen when Israel defies the wishes
*06:56.360- 06:59.480* :  of American presidents and what the White House sees
*06:59.820- 07:00.700* :  as US interests.
*07:01.680- 07:04.540* :  No crisis in the long US-Israel alliance
*07:04.540- 07:07.800* :  has been more serious than the one that's developed
*07:07.800- 07:10.380* :  in almost six months of war in Gaza.
*07:10.920- 07:14.160* :  Jeremy Bowen and will be returning to this story later
*07:14.560- 07:15.980* :  in the Global News Podcast.
*07:17.180- 07:19.940* :  With a delayed election, the opposition candidate in jail
*07:20.120- 07:23.380* :  and violent street protests, it wasn't inevitable
*07:23.380- 07:26.040* :  that Sunday's presidential election in Senegal
*07:26.060- 07:27.260* :  would be free and fair.
*07:27.860- 07:30.040* :  But democracy seems to have won the day.
*07:30.040- 07:32.660* :  The governing coalition has conceded defeat,
*07:32.660- 07:35.880* :  and the next president will be Bessarou Jomifi,
*07:35.940- 07:39.560* :  who campaigned from prison on a promise of radical change.
*07:39.580- 07:42.080* :  As early results suggested he was in the lead,
*07:42.360- 07:44.560* :  mystified supporters began celebrating.
*07:50.860- 07:53.000* :  Our correspondent, Thomas Naddi, is there.
*07:53.480- 07:56.260* :  It's a huge relief for the people of this country.
*07:56.260- 07:58.760* :  I'm currently out on the streets of Dhaka.
*07:59.260- 08:00.680* :  Normalcy has retained.
*08:00.680- 08:02.100* :  People are happy.
*08:02.480- 08:05.940* :  The fact that the ruling party candidate has congratulated
*08:06.340- 08:08.900* :  Mr. Jomifi is very significant.
*08:08.900- 08:12.360* :  And also, President Makisal has done the same
*08:12.360- 08:16.340* :  and said that this is a victory for the country's democracy.
*08:16.340- 08:18.720* :  And which is also important because they run
*08:18.720- 08:21.920* :  after the election was mad by violent protests
*08:22.820- 08:24.400* :  with clashes between the police
*08:24.820- 08:26.100* :  and the youth of this country.
*08:26.600- 08:28.540* :  Now, before the Electoral Commission
*08:28.540- 08:30.080* :  announces the official results,
*08:30.420- 08:32.220* :  people have been out on the streets
*08:32.600- 08:34.520* :  to celebrate a victory of mystified
*08:34.520- 08:37.180* :  and the triumph of democracy in this country.
*08:37.500- 08:40.740* :  So what will Mr. Jomifi's main challenge be
*08:40.740- 08:42.180* :  when he takes over as president?
*08:42.660- 08:45.140* :  Senegal has a very youthful population
*08:45.200- 08:47.200* :  with a median age of 19.
*08:47.700- 08:50.260* :  Unemployment is a huge problem here.
*08:50.620- 08:52.420* :  That will be one of its priorities.
*08:52.420- 08:55.260* :  It has forced many to embark on dangerous
*08:55.260- 08:57.920* :  journey to Europe to see greener pastures.
*08:58.200- 09:00.340* :  There's also a cost of living crisis
*09:00.760- 09:02.640* :  with as affected many families.
*09:02.980- 09:04.880* :  And of course, institutional reforms
*09:04.980- 09:07.320* :  to safeguard the country's democracy.
*09:07.800- 09:08.840* :  But that is not all.
*09:09.080- 09:11.840* :  Senegal hopes to begin oil and gas production
*09:12.240- 09:13.540* :  by the end of this year.
*09:13.900- 09:17.400* :  And Jomifi has promised to renegotiate
*09:17.460- 09:19.340* :  all energy contracts in this country.
*09:19.860- 09:23.380* :  He has significant support for his presidency then.
*09:23.760- 09:26.140* :  Certainly, he's enjoying a lot of support
*09:26.140- 09:27.440* :  from the country's youth
*09:27.820- 09:30.660* :  backed by a firebrand opposition candidate,
*09:30.660- 09:31.880* :  Osman Tsungu.
*09:32.060- 09:35.020* :  And he also enjoys a lot of support from the diaspora.
*09:35.420- 09:38.120* :  And many are hopeful that when he comes to power,
*09:38.120- 09:39.940* :  you'll be able to address some of the concerns
*09:39.940- 09:40.720* :  of this country.
*09:41.000- 09:42.680* :  Thomas Nadi in Senegal.
*09:43.720- 09:46.240* :  In New York, two separate court decisions
*09:46.460- 09:48.440* :  have been made in relation to Donald Trump.
*09:48.600- 09:50.940* :  First, we now have a date for when
*09:50.940- 09:53.340* :  he'll go to trial over alleged harsh money
*09:53.340- 09:55.540* :  paid to porn star stormy Daniels
*09:55.540- 09:57.120* :  before the 2016 election.
*09:57.680- 10:00.480* :  It will start on April 15th, just as Mr Trump
*10:00.480- 10:02.860* :  gears up for another presidential campaign.
*10:03.420- 10:05.220* :  In the other case, an appeals court
*10:05.220- 10:07.360* :  has reduced the bond payment Mr Trump
*10:07.360- 10:09.440* :  has to make in a civil fraud appeal
*10:09.440- 10:12.280* :  by more than half to $175 million
*10:13.060- 10:16.140* :  and given him an extra 10 days to find the money.
*10:16.520- 10:20.520* :  Originally, he was ordered to find $464 million,
*10:20.520- 10:22.620* :  which he said was impossible.
*10:22.680- 10:24.880* :  Netatorfic has more from New York.
*10:25.580- 10:27.540* :  Donald Trump's legal team has sought
*10:27.540- 10:32.360* :  to delay as much as possible the various trials he is facing.
*10:32.360- 10:34.560* :  And the district attorney here in New York
*10:34.560- 10:36.240* :  accused him of doing exactly that.
*10:36.240- 10:39.500* :  In this case, applying just in January
*10:39.540- 10:43.220* :  to subpoena some extra documents from Michael Cohen,
*10:43.220- 10:45.400* :  his former fixer, that's really at the center
*10:45.840- 10:47.060* :  of this harsh money case.
*10:47.060- 10:49.220* :  He was the one that he paid back
*10:49.280- 10:52.480* :  for paying the former porn star stormy Daniels allegedly
*10:52.480- 10:55.500* :  according to prosecutors here in New York.
*10:56.060- 10:58.900* :  Now, because of that, there was this long hearing
*10:58.900- 11:02.640* :  back and forth about how long this trial should be delayed.
*11:02.640- 11:06.900* :  But the judge was quite angry about some of the arguments
*11:06.900- 11:08.700* :  that Donald Trump's team put forward
*11:08.740- 11:11.260* :  about there being prosecutorial misconduct.
*11:11.440- 11:13.700* :  Essentially eluded to the fact that he thought
*11:13.700- 11:15.740* :  that was completely unfounded.
*11:16.160- 11:18.640* :  So instead, he granted the 30-day delay
*11:18.640- 11:21.760* :  that the district attorney had agreed to saying
*11:21.760- 11:23.340* :  because there were more documents
*11:24.060- 11:25.900* :  that were furnished by federal prosecutors,
*11:25.940- 11:28.940* :  it wouldn't take 90 days as Donald Trump wanted
*11:28.940- 11:29.920* :  to go through all of those.
*11:30.320- 11:33.820* :  So we do now have a trial date set April 15th,
*11:34.040- 11:35.440* :  and that makes it pretty certain,
*11:35.440- 11:36.880* :  unless anything else changes,
*11:37.400- 11:39.580* :  that voters will know before November
*11:39.660- 11:41.800* :  whether Donald Trump will be a convicted felon
*11:41.800- 11:44.300* :  in this case or acquitted of the charges against him.
*11:44.700- 11:45.560* :  Neddett Orfig.
*11:46.420- 11:50.580* :  There's been a striking rise in cancers among the under 50s.
*11:50.580- 11:54.080* :  One recent study found an almost 80% rise worldwide
*11:54.080- 11:57.160* :  in early onset cancer over the last three decades.
*11:57.160- 11:58.640* :  That is a global figure,
*11:59.120- 12:01.500* :  but the highest rates of early onset cancers
*12:01.500- 12:02.940* :  are in wealthy countries.
*12:03.400- 12:05.360* :  Lauren Fresser from Wales was diagnosed
*12:05.360- 12:09.040* :  with bowel cancer in 2021 when she was 33.
*12:09.780- 12:13.340* :  I went to my GP a lot and it didn't get any better,
*12:13.340- 12:16.180* :  asking them for more investigation and that didn't happen.
*12:16.460- 12:18.860* :  And it was only due to my stubbornness,
*12:18.860- 12:20.500* :  really, taking myself to hospital
*12:20.500- 12:22.600* :  and I ended up in emergency surgery
*12:22.600- 12:24.800* :  and I was told that another 24 hours
*12:24.800- 12:27.740* :  and my bowel would have completely ruptured and killed me.
*12:27.900- 12:29.540* :  And I was also pregnant at the time,
*12:29.540- 12:31.640* :  which unfortunately, that baby died.
*12:32.020- 12:33.940* :  There is this scarred up of, you know,
*12:33.940- 12:35.480* :  you're too young for certain tests,
*12:35.480- 12:37.360* :  but you have to advocate for yourself,
*12:37.360- 12:38.200* :  which is a shame,
*12:38.200- 12:39.740* :  because as the report says,
*12:39.740- 12:43.580* :  this is now becoming so much more prevalent among people
*12:43.580- 12:45.040* :  and particularly women as well.
*12:45.540- 12:48.060* :  The findings come just days after the Princess of Wales
*12:48.060- 12:50.800* :  revealed that she was diagnosed with a form of cancer
*12:51.160- 12:53.960* :  after undergoing abdominal surgery in January.
*12:54.420- 12:55.800* :  My colleague, Evan Davis,
*12:56.060- 12:59.360* :  spoke about the latest research to Helen Coleman,
*12:59.780- 13:02.000* :  a professor of cancer epidemiology
*13:02.300- 13:03.980* :  at Queen's University Belfast.
*13:04.480- 13:08.020* :  There was a 20% increase in cancers being diagnosed
*13:08.020- 13:10.540* :  in people aged 18 to 49.
*13:10.540- 13:15.640* :  That's comparing 2019 data to the early 1990s.
*13:16.540- 13:18.980* :  And similar increases have been noted
*13:18.980- 13:21.440* :  in other Western countries around the world.
*13:22.040- 13:23.420* :  Something is going on there.
*13:23.680- 13:25.180* :  Must be diet, now what is it?
*13:25.340- 13:26.840* :  A short answer is we know,
*13:26.840- 13:29.720* :  but there are two potential explanations.
*13:30.580- 13:33.220* :  So one is that risk factors we know about,
*13:33.400- 13:36.180* :  like tobacco smoking, alcohol exposure,
*13:36.760- 13:37.940* :  being overweight or obese,
*13:37.960- 13:40.160* :  that we are potentially being exposed
*13:40.300- 13:41.900* :  to those earlier in our lives
*13:41.940- 13:46.120* :  and therefore more likely to get cancer at an earlier age
*13:46.420- 13:48.220* :  or that it's a generational effect
*13:48.640- 13:50.080* :  and that this generation
*13:50.500- 13:53.020* :  have been exposed to changes in our environment
*13:53.060- 13:55.060* :  or other changes in our lifestyle
*13:55.880- 13:57.480* :  that are causing these cancers
*13:57.480- 13:59.860* :  and we don't yet know what they are.
*14:00.100- 14:02.760* :  For example, changes in exposure to chemicals,
*14:03.120- 14:05.080* :  changes in the medications that we take
*14:05.200- 14:07.220* :  onto biotics has been hypothesized
*14:07.900- 14:11.380* :  or changes in our diet, for example, processed foods.
*14:12.020- 14:13.820* :  But it's really important to say
*14:13.820- 14:15.720* :  that we don't have good enough data
*14:16.080- 14:18.200* :  to be definitive about any of those.
*14:18.600- 14:21.300* :  Is there a changing pattern of the kind of cancers
*14:21.300- 14:23.140* :  that we're seeing people get?
*14:23.360- 14:25.580* :  Yes, this is the other thing that's very concerning
*14:26.480- 14:28.600* :  in that age group between 18 and 49.
*14:28.680- 14:31.900* :  We see different cancers for men than we do for women.
*14:32.120- 14:33.380* :  So traditionally in men,
*14:33.380- 14:36.640* :  you would have seen cancers like testicular cancer,
*14:36.940- 14:40.240* :  lymphoma, and women by far and away
*14:40.240- 14:42.140* :  the most prevalent cancer being diagnosed
*14:42.140- 14:45.000* :  in that age group is pre-menopausal breast cancer.
*14:45.840- 14:47.580* :  So that would account for about four and 10.
*14:47.580- 14:51.500* :  But we are seeing a rise in digestive cancers
*14:51.500- 14:53.320* :  like bile cancer in particular
*14:53.660- 14:55.520* :  is causing concern around the world.
*14:55.760- 14:57.920* :  For example, the USA has lowered
*14:57.920- 15:01.980* :  their bile cancer screening age eligibility to 45
*15:02.340- 15:03.720* :  in response to this.
*15:03.860- 15:05.240* :  It's not a diagnosis thing.
*15:05.300- 15:07.620* :  It's not that we talk about cancer much more,
*15:07.620- 15:10.560* :  we're much more aware of it people go and get diagnosed.
*15:10.840- 15:15.460* :  Maybe for cancers that would have existed untreated
*15:15.460- 15:17.060* :  and maybe not very dangerously.
*15:17.060- 15:18.660* :  Is it anything like that going on?
*15:18.820- 15:19.700* :  It's a good question.
*15:19.840- 15:22.260* :  I don't think that is the answer here.
*15:22.260- 15:24.320* :  We do think this is a genuine rise
*15:24.460- 15:27.200* :  because we are seeing it across all age groups,
*15:27.200- 15:29.000* :  people in their 20s, 30s,
*15:29.300- 15:30.920* :  particularly people in their 40s.
*15:31.040- 15:33.720* :  But the other thing is we only have a screening program
*15:33.720- 15:37.600* :  for cervical cancer in women from the age of 25.
*15:37.840- 15:40.760* :  There's no other screening program done in this age group
*15:40.920- 15:42.020* :  and there's no particular reason
*15:42.020- 15:45.440* :  why people would come forward now more than they used to.
*15:45.900- 15:47.700* :  However, that's what we want to happen
*15:47.700- 15:50.240* :  as a result of this awareness raising.
*15:51.060- 15:52.580* :  So if people are at home
*15:52.700- 15:55.960* :  and are experiencing symptoms that are unusual for them,
*15:56.580- 15:57.980* :  please contact their GP.
*15:58.480- 16:00.920* :  And don't think, oh, cancer won't be affecting me
*16:00.920- 16:02.360* :  because I'm 30.
*16:02.740- 16:04.700* :  Yeah, never too young, unfortunately.
*16:05.380- 16:09.400* :  This rise in people aged 18 to 49 is much higher
*16:09.400- 16:11.620* :  than the rise we're seeing in older age groups.
*16:12.320- 16:13.480* :  Go and get checked out.
*16:13.760- 16:15.820* :  The likelihood of it being cancer is low.
*16:15.820- 16:19.000* :  But if it is cancer, it's better that you know about it
*16:19.160- 16:20.520* :  and that you're diagnosed early
*16:20.920- 16:22.800* :  because treatment is much more successful.
*16:23.540- 16:26.440* :  Professor Helen Coleman speaking to Evan Davis.
*16:27.700- 16:30.300* :  The UK has blamed China for interfering
*16:30.300- 16:32.400* :  in Britain's democracy by carrying out
*16:32.400- 16:35.440* :  two malicious cyber campaigns in 2021.
*16:36.200- 16:38.640* :  One was aimed at MPs who were critical of China
*16:38.640- 16:41.240* :  and the other was against the electoral commission
*16:41.360- 16:44.420* :  in which the personal details of 40 million voters
*16:44.420- 16:45.080* :  were accessed.
*16:45.140- 16:47.660* :  Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden
*16:47.900- 16:50.740* :  told Parliament that this signaled hostile behavior
*16:50.740- 16:53.320* :  from China and that the government was taking steps
*16:53.320- 16:54.380* :  to address the threat.
*16:55.020- 16:59.940* :  We are today acting to warn of the breadth of targeting
*16:59.940- 17:03.080* :  emanating from Chinese state-affiliated actors
*17:03.600- 17:08.120* :  like APT31 to sanction those actors
*17:08.540- 17:11.600* :  who attempt to threaten our democratic institutions
*17:12.660- 17:18.120* :  and to deter both China and all those who seek to do the same.
*17:18.820- 17:21.440* :  Early air spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry,
*17:22.680- 17:25.100* :  preempted the announcement by issuing this warning.
*17:27.940- 17:29.480* :  Cyber security is a global challenge.
*17:29.480- 17:31.460* :  The tracking of origins of cyber attacks
*17:31.460- 17:33.040* :  is highly sensitive and complicated.
*17:33.600- 17:35.640* :  They must be fully backed up with objective evidence
*17:35.640- 17:38.360* :  and one should not pin the blame on some certain countries
*17:38.360- 17:41.840* :  without any factual basis, let alone politicize this issue.
*17:42.080- 17:44.320* :  We hope that parties can stop spreading this information
*17:44.480- 17:45.820* :  and take a responsible attitude
*17:45.820- 17:48.620* :  and jointly safeguard security and peace of cyberspace.
*17:49.100- 17:52.200* :  I asked UK political correspondent Rob Watson
*17:52.200- 17:54.340* :  if British voters should be worried.
*17:55.080- 17:57.100* :  No, according to the government, Alex,
*17:57.140- 17:59.440* :  but it was a slightly contradictory message
*17:59.440- 18:02.100* :  from Mr. Dowden who you heard from a second ago
*18:02.640- 18:03.580* :  in that he was saying, look,
*18:03.580- 18:05.500* :  and the words were exactly Alex,
*18:05.500- 18:07.160* :  I want to reassure people that the compromise
*18:07.160- 18:09.260* :  of this information while concerning
*18:09.260- 18:11.420* :  does not create a risk to those affected.
*18:11.940- 18:14.420* :  So reassurance, Britain's democracy is safe,
*18:14.480- 18:16.080* :  but on the other hand, he also said,
*18:16.520- 18:18.980* :  I do urge institutions, corporations,
*18:19.220- 18:22.340* :  everybody in the UK to be aware of the scale of the threat.
*18:22.960- 18:25.540* :  So the UK is introducing sanctions
*18:26.140- 18:29.520* :  on two people and summoning the Chinese ambassador
*18:29.520- 18:30.940* :  is trying to get a care.
*18:31.300- 18:32.420* :  It's a very good question.
*18:33.160- 18:35.060* :  I mean, let's just take China's response.
*18:35.120- 18:36.420* :  You heard a bit of it there.
*18:36.420- 18:39.720* :  We also had a response from the embassy here in London
*18:39.720- 18:42.460* :  saying that this was spreading false information
*18:42.460- 18:46.060* :  that Britain was engaged in a anti-China political far.
*18:46.060- 18:47.840* :  So they clearly don't enjoy it.
*18:47.840- 18:50.140* :  Whether it changes their behavior is another question.
*18:50.140- 18:53.860* :  And of course, what critics of Britain's China policy,
*18:53.860- 18:55.760* :  those who take up one to harder line,
*18:56.500- 18:57.400* :  including many, of course,
*18:57.400- 19:00.380* :  on the governing Conservative Party adventures say,
*19:00.380- 19:02.580* :  is, look, why on earth would China care
*19:02.580- 19:05.300* :  about a couple of people being sanctioned
*19:05.620- 19:06.980* :  on one very tiny company?
*19:06.980- 19:08.940* :  And one of those MPs who'd been targeted
*19:09.460- 19:11.600* :  by China and who takes a pretty tough line
*19:11.600- 19:13.320* :  at a man called Ian Duncan Smith,
*19:13.440- 19:15.480* :  he sort of ridiculed the British government's approach,
*19:15.480- 19:17.280* :  saying, I think the words were Alex
*19:17.280- 19:18.720* :  that it was like watching an elephant
*19:18.720- 19:20.000* :  giving birth to my mouse.
*19:20.200- 19:22.900* :  Britain still wants to do business with China, though.
*19:23.200- 19:24.760* :  How realistic is that?
*19:25.440- 19:26.800* :  Again, it's a very good question.
*19:26.800- 19:29.460* :  And look, Britain is confronting the same sort of dilemma
*19:29.460- 19:32.280* :  that lots of other Western European countries have.
*19:32.320- 19:35.420* :  And that is to see if you consider their policy credible,
*19:35.460- 19:37.180* :  a policy which is on the one hand,
*19:37.180- 19:39.880* :  we want to engage, trade, do business with China,
*19:39.880- 19:42.440* :  cooperate on things like climate change,
*19:42.440- 19:46.000* :  but also to challenge China on issues like espionage
*19:46.220- 19:46.940* :  and human rights.
*19:46.940- 19:49.160* :  Now critics of that sort of approach,
*19:49.240- 19:51.100* :  and it's not just Britain taking that approach,
*19:51.100- 19:53.200* :  but other Western countries will say, come on,
*19:53.420- 19:54.840* :  you just can't really do that.
*19:54.840- 19:56.160* :  That's just not going to work.
*19:56.160- 19:57.480* :  But of course, Western governments
*19:57.480- 19:58.760* :  like the British government would say,
*19:58.760- 20:00.860* :  well, come up with a better idea then.
*20:01.600- 20:02.140* :  Rob Watson.
*20:04.720- 20:07.320* :  Still to come in the global news podcast.
*20:07.640- 20:11.020* :  Chief Executive David Calhoun, he says he's going to step down
*20:11.020- 20:13.200* :  at the end of this year, stand deal.
*20:13.220- 20:15.580* :  He's the head of the division that makes the plane
*20:15.680- 20:17.000* :  for commercial customers.
*20:17.000- 20:18.520* :  He's going to retire immediately.
*20:19.100- 20:21.420* :  Boeing takes drastic measures to salvage
*20:21.420- 20:23.040* :  its aviation safety record.
*20:31.420- 20:34.160* :  President Putin has said radical Islamists
*20:34.160- 20:37.380* :  carried out Friday's deadly attack on a Moscow concert hall
*20:37.460- 20:39.860* :  that left at least 139 people dead
*20:40.320- 20:41.300* :  and scores injured.
*20:41.780- 20:44.380* :  But he has again claimed that the suspected attackers
*20:44.600- 20:46.840* :  tried to flee to Ukraine, an allegation
*20:46.840- 20:48.640* :  that Kiev has dismissed as ridiculous.
*20:48.700- 20:51.620* :  Here's our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Aberhardt.
*20:52.080- 20:55.080* :  Three days have passed since both the massacre itself
*20:55.080- 20:56.900* :  at the Kroka City concert hall
*20:57.220- 20:58.840* :  and the first claim of responsibility
*20:58.840- 21:00.980* :  by the militant group Islamic State.
*21:01.780- 21:04.000* :  That's the length of time it's taken President Putin
*21:04.000- 21:06.280* :  to pin the blame on radical Islamists.
*21:06.880- 21:08.940* :  Earlier in the day, the Kremlin had refused
*21:08.940- 21:11.740* :  to answer a question about the Islamic State's claim.
*21:12.420- 21:14.840* :  The group has published graphic footage of the attack,
*21:15.460- 21:17.880* :  but Mr. Putin appears determined to pursue
*21:17.880- 21:19.880* :  what he's claimed is a link to Ukraine
*21:19.880- 21:23.020* :  despite providing no concrete evidence of one.
*21:23.600- 21:26.000* :  Russia says the four suspected perpetrators,
*21:26.300- 21:29.460* :  all tragic nationals, were arrested in Briensk,
*21:29.760- 21:32.120* :  a region that borders both Ukraine and Belarus.
*21:33.000- 21:35.140* :  Kiev has emphatically rejected attempts
*21:35.140- 21:37.600* :  by Russian officials to link it to the attack.
*21:38.300- 21:40.040* :  It and its allies have warned Russia
*21:40.040- 21:42.980* :  against trying to exploit the atrocities spuriously,
*21:43.460- 21:45.300* :  fearing Mr. Putin will try to use it
*21:45.300- 21:48.440* :  to justify a further escalation of his war in Ukraine.
*21:49.300- 21:51.860* :  Meanwhile, a Russian court has remanded in custody
*21:52.280- 21:54.680* :  three other men, all members of the same family,
*21:54.680- 21:57.320* :  whom investigators have also linked to the attack.
*21:57.960- 22:00.120* :  There are two brothers who are Russian citizens
*22:00.120- 22:03.580* :  and their father, a tragic national resident in Russia.
*22:04.000- 22:05.380* :  Danny Aberhardt.
*22:06.180- 22:08.100* :  Let's return to our top story,
*22:08.100- 22:10.620* :  the UN Security Council's adaptation
*22:10.620- 22:14.400* :  of a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
*22:15.020- 22:16.760* :  Fourteen countries voted in favor
*22:16.760- 22:19.620* :  with none against while the US abstained.
*22:19.980- 22:22.220* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*22:22.220- 22:25.160* :  said the US decision not to use its veto
*22:25.160- 22:27.620* :  was a clear retreat from its previous position
*22:28.000- 22:30.340* :  and he canceled a planned visit to Washington
*22:30.720- 22:32.700* :  by a high-level delegation in protest.
*22:33.280- 22:34.560* :  Speaking at a news conference,
*22:34.560- 22:37.400* :  the White House spokesman John Kirby insisted
*22:37.400- 22:40.600* :  that the US policy on Gaza remained the same.
*22:41.300- 22:44.300* :  It does not represent a change at all in our policy
*22:44.660- 22:46.880* :  and we get to decide what our policy is.
*22:46.960- 22:48.880* :  The Prime Minister's office seems to be indicating
*22:48.880- 22:51.740* :  through public statements that we somehow changed here.
*22:51.880- 22:52.260* :  We haven't.
*22:52.520- 22:54.700* :  It seems like the Prime Minister's office
*22:54.700- 22:59.080* :  is choosing to create a perception of daylight here
*22:59.460- 23:01.040* :  when they don't need to do that.
*23:01.400- 23:03.140* :  Hamas, welcome the resolution
*23:03.140- 23:06.840* :  while the Palestinian envoy to the UN Readmancer
*23:07.160- 23:09.960* :  said it should be a turning point in ending the war.
*23:10.580- 23:12.080* :  It has taken six months,
*23:13.000- 23:16.680* :  over 100,000 Palestinians killed and maimed,
*23:17.200- 23:18.320* :  two million displaced,
*23:19.480- 23:22.920* :  and famine for this council to finally demand
*23:24.080- 23:25.240* :  an immediate ceasefire.
*23:26.260- 23:28.560* :  A vote for humanity to prevail,
*23:29.380- 23:31.060* :  for life to prevail.
*23:32.160- 23:35.760* :  Their ordeal must come to an end now.
*23:36.400- 23:39.180* :  On Monday, the main UN agency for Gaza,
*23:39.180- 23:42.220* :  Anra, said it had been blocked from delivering food
*23:42.260- 23:43.840* :  to northern areas of the territory,
*23:44.200- 23:47.260* :  accusing Israel of intentionally obstructing aid.
*23:47.260- 23:50.420* :  Israel has accused Anra of links with Hamas.
*23:50.780- 23:53.200* :  Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson
*23:53.200- 23:55.380* :  has been speaking to the Israeli army
*23:55.700- 23:58.620* :  at a new aid crossing point on the Gaza border.
*24:01.240- 24:04.460* :  Gate 96 is little more than a hole in the board of fence,
*24:04.980- 24:07.080* :  but it leads straight into northern Gaza,
*24:07.580- 24:09.500* :  where the warnings of famine are most acute.
*24:12.660- 24:15.680* :  We watch a seven-aid trucks line up to cross in
*24:16.120- 24:17.980* :  under the boom of outgoing artillery.
*24:19.720- 24:21.960* :  The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres
*24:22.420- 24:25.500* :  has warned that Gaza faces an approaching famine.
*24:26.060- 24:28.320* :  Palestinians in Gaza desperately needs
*24:28.320- 24:31.120* :  what has been promised, a flood of aid,
*24:31.580- 24:33.200* :  not trickles, not drops.
*24:33.780- 24:36.880* :  Some progress has been made that much more needs to be done.
*24:37.180- 24:39.600* :  Making that happen requires Israel removing
*24:39.600- 24:42.780* :  the remaining obstacles and shock points to relief.
*24:45.880- 24:49.760* :  Gate 96 lets convoys bypass active conflict zones
*24:49.760- 24:51.480* :  and destruction inside Gaza.
*24:52.200- 24:54.900* :  But Israel says it won't allow any deliveries there
*24:54.900- 24:57.540* :  from Gaza's main relief agency, Anrawa,
*24:58.080- 25:00.320* :  saying the agency is linked to Hamas.
*25:01.080- 25:03.400* :  Anrawa's director said it was outrageous
*25:03.980- 25:07.000* :  and accused Israel of intentionally obstructing aid.
*25:08.040- 25:10.300* :  At the board of fence, Colonel Moshe Tetro,
*25:10.540- 25:14.040* :  the chief aid coordinator for the Israeli army or IDF,
*25:14.420- 25:16.420* :  told me that the only limits on aid
*25:16.420- 25:18.440* :  came from aid agencies themselves.
*25:19.400- 25:22.840* :  The IDF, we took a lot of measures in order to enlarge
*25:22.840- 25:24.360* :  the amount of humanitarian aid,
*25:24.660- 25:27.480* :  but the UN and other international organizations
*25:27.480- 25:29.080* :  have some bottlenecks.
*25:29.360- 25:32.500* :  They have issues and challenges regarding logistics
*25:32.500- 25:35.480* :  of amount of trucks, amount of truck drivers,
*25:36.220- 25:37.540* :  manpower, et cetera.
*25:37.920- 25:39.900* :  He pointed to the trucks waiting to cross,
*25:39.900- 25:42.740* :  saying the evidence was right in front of us.
*25:43.300- 25:46.380* :  20 trucks had been approved across that night, he said,
*25:46.880- 25:48.400* :  but only seven showed up.
*25:48.640- 25:51.200* :  On this particular convoy, we were given a limit
*25:51.200- 25:54.540* :  of 15 vetted drivers by the IDF
*25:54.860- 25:56.360* :  that were cleared to use this route,
*25:56.860- 25:58.600* :  but only seven were available to us.
*25:59.000- 26:01.300* :  Some had already gone up to Gaza City the day before
*26:01.700- 26:03.360* :  and they simply hadn't been able to return yet.
*26:03.620- 26:06.660* :  Matt Hollingworth, country director for the World Food Programme,
*26:06.860- 26:08.620* :  was on board one of those trucks.
*26:09.260- 26:11.080* :  He told me that Israel had approved
*26:11.080- 26:13.860* :  just 15 drivers for this new route
*26:14.400- 26:16.680* :  and that half was stuck in Gaza City.
*26:17.100- 26:21.280* :  We literally need 50, 60, 70, 80 truck drivers cleared
*26:21.860- 26:23.840* :  to use these routes every single day.
*26:23.860- 26:28.120* :  We need more entry points to Northern Gaza and Gaza City
*26:28.660- 26:30.360* :  and we need early approvals
*26:30.800- 26:33.740* :  so that we can run multiple convoys every single day.
*26:34.720- 26:38.560* :  Colonel Tetro tells me there's no shortage of food in Gaza
*26:39.220- 26:41.980* :  and that if Hamas wants to change the situation there,
*26:42.400- 26:43.400* :  they should end the war.
*26:43.980- 26:45.900* :  Do you think children are starving in Gaza?
*26:46.280- 26:47.200* :  I know that they are not.
*26:47.380- 26:49.940* :  So when you see those pictures of children starving in hospital,
*26:49.940- 26:50.700* :  what do you think?
*26:51.200- 26:54.260* :  I said and I will say it again, as much as I know,
*26:54.700- 26:56.040* :  there is no starvation in Gaza.
*26:57.440- 26:59.800* :  The crossing point opens and the trucks move off
*26:59.800- 27:02.060* :  into the darkness on the other side of the fence.
*27:02.880- 27:06.620* :  Israel is keen to show the world its allowing more aid into Gaza
*27:07.280- 27:10.660* :  but says it's not responsible for the amount going in.
*27:11.340- 27:12.960* :  International law says different
*27:13.680- 27:16.680* :  that Israel has a duty, not just to open the gates
*27:17.320- 27:21.400* :  but to get food and medicine to the people under its control.
*27:22.480- 27:24.180* :  Lucy Williamson with that report.
*27:25.200- 27:28.740* :  The boss of the world's second-largest aeroplane manufacture
*27:28.740- 27:31.400* :  of Boeing has announced he's leaving after a string
*27:31.400- 27:32.840* :  of serious safety failures.
*27:33.280- 27:35.840* :  Dave Calhoun's announcement comes less than three months
*27:35.840- 27:39.760* :  after a door on a Boeing plane blew out shortly after take-off
*27:40.160- 27:42.880* :  and North America business correspondent is Michelle Flurry.
*27:43.420- 27:45.600* :  You've got the chief executive, David Calhoun.
*27:45.660- 27:48.600* :  He says he's going to step down at the end of this year,
*27:48.600- 27:52.140* :  his department, this part of this broader management shake-up
*27:52.480- 27:53.880* :  because you've also got Stan Deal.
*27:53.920- 27:56.280* :  He's the head of the division that makes the plane
*27:56.360- 27:57.680* :  for commercial customers.
*27:57.680- 27:59.200* :  He's going to retire immediately
*27:59.780- 28:01.860* :  and is going to be replaced by some called Stephanie Pope.
*28:01.980- 28:05.560* :  You've got the company also announcing that its chairman, Larry Kelner,
*28:05.560- 28:08.600* :  will not stand for re-election to the board in Maine
*28:08.600- 28:12.140* :  because Boeing is grappling with its most significant safety crisis
*28:12.580- 28:13.100* :  in years.
*28:13.500- 28:16.440* :  And it's a crisis that really have left its customers very frustrated.
*28:16.440- 28:19.640* :  Last week, apparently, a group of US airline CEOs
*28:19.640- 28:21.960* :  sought meetings with Boeing directors
*28:21.960- 28:25.040* :  to express their concern over what has been going on,
*28:25.580- 28:26.740* :  starting you may recall recently
*28:26.740- 28:28.700* :  with that Alaska Airlines incident
*28:28.700- 28:31.020* :  when a kind of door plug fell out.
*28:31.160- 28:32.600* :  And it's an unusual sign.
*28:32.620- 28:35.540* :  You don't typically see that frustration with the manufacturer.
*28:35.620- 28:39.660* :  And I think this was an attempt by management to try and restore faith.
*28:39.980- 28:41.940* :  The initial reaction has been positive,
*28:42.160- 28:45.700* :  analysts and investors say this is a good thing for Boeing.
*28:45.740- 28:49.000* :  It's a step forward in their trying to sort of regain confidence.
*28:49.560- 28:51.660* :  But if you listen to what analysts are saying,
*28:51.660- 28:55.360* :  they say a lot depends on who is chosen as Calhoun's successor.
*28:55.620- 28:59.960* :  And will that be enough to change the company's culture from the top?
*29:00.280- 29:03.620* :  If you look at this, a once great company is not so great
*29:03.700- 29:06.220* :  and we're kind of seeing these attempts to write the ship.
*29:06.560- 29:07.440* :  Michelle Flurry.
*29:08.560- 29:12.220* :  Dutch darts is grappling with the issue of a trans woman
*29:12.220- 29:13.520* :  competing in the sport.
*29:13.520- 29:16.920* :  Two of its players have decided to quit the Netherlands women's team
*29:17.300- 29:19.940* :  after the National Association backed trans woman,
*29:19.940- 29:23.940* :  Noah Lin van Lurfen, to compete correspondent in the Netherlands
*29:23.940- 29:26.680* :  and a hologon told me more about the two players
*29:26.680- 29:27.940* :  and why they chose to leave.
*29:28.640- 29:32.080* :  We're talking about two big names in women's darts here.
*29:32.080- 29:38.020* :  So Anca Zelstra and Linda Graf announced they were boycossing international duty
*29:38.020- 29:40.340* :  so they're basically not making themselves available
*29:40.400- 29:44.320* :  because they don't want to play alongside their transgender teammate,
*29:44.320- 29:46.100* :  Nolan Van Lurfen.
*29:46.860- 29:51.240* :  Zelstra, she's currently ranked 12th by the World Darts Federation.
*29:51.380- 29:54.120* :  She posted a statement on Facebook over the weekend,
*29:54.400- 29:57.700* :  which the Darts Darts Association responded to today.
*29:58.220- 30:00.800* :  She said she made this decision with pain in her heart
*30:00.980- 30:02.440* :  and that when the time comes,
*30:02.440- 30:04.600* :  you're embarrassed to turn out for the Netherlands
*30:04.600- 30:07.360* :  because a biological man is playing for the women's team.
*30:07.840- 30:09.580* :  Then, you know, it's time to go.
*30:09.820- 30:12.500* :  She said sport needs a fair and level playing field.
*30:12.940- 30:15.560* :  Her colleague, number two, de Graf, and she said,
*30:15.960- 30:18.100* :  if someone doesn't feel good in the body they were born in,
*30:18.100- 30:20.180* :  I encourage everyone to change that and be happy.
*30:20.180- 30:22.620* :  I just don't think it's right for a biological man
*30:22.620- 30:25.160* :  to throw for women or vice versa.
*30:25.160- 30:27.100* :  It's either mixed or not.
*30:27.100- 30:29.980* :  So what has Noah Lin van Lurfen said?
*30:30.480- 30:33.500* :  As you can imagine, it's been an emotional strain.
*30:33.500- 30:35.580* :  She says it's taken up a lot of energy,
*30:35.580- 30:37.440* :  but she pointed out the choice was there.
*30:37.440- 30:38.140* :  It's not hers.
*30:38.140- 30:41.200* :  All of this has come in the middle of a role for her.
*30:41.220- 30:44.120* :  She just made history by becoming the first transgender
*30:44.140- 30:45.680* :  a Darts player to win tournaments
*30:45.680- 30:48.340* :  playing against both men and women in the same week,
*30:48.340- 30:49.760* :  one in Germany, one in England.
*30:50.480- 30:53.780* :  And we should just say the Dutch Darts Federation rule state
*30:53.780- 30:57.100* :  that trans women are eligible to play in the women's category.
*30:57.100- 31:00.960* :  If a doctor has confirmed they've been undergoing
*31:00.960- 31:03.940* :  gender treatment for at least a year.
*31:04.760- 31:07.640* :  So what's the reaction to all this been more generally
*31:07.640- 31:10.580* :  in the Netherlands in the press and amongst Darts fans?
*31:11.080- 31:13.800* :  Darts is massive here.
*31:14.240- 31:16.260* :  Amateur level also professionally.
*31:16.320- 31:19.440* :  So the story has been making a lot of headlines.
*31:20.220- 31:22.980* :  Darts Darts Association says it regrets the decision
*31:22.980- 31:26.160* :  by the two, but it has defended van Lurfen,
*31:26.300- 31:28.720* :  who's currently the women's world number six thing.
*31:28.720- 31:32.280* :  I was known, she has completed her transition.
*31:32.960- 31:35.540* :  And also there are other sports players,
*31:35.540- 31:37.840* :  retired sports players getting involved.
*31:37.840- 31:39.740* :  So it's a contentious issue,
*31:39.940- 31:42.360* :  but she is remaining in the Dutch team.
*31:42.800- 31:45.320* :  How correspondent in the Netherlands and the Holigen?
*31:46.280- 31:49.600* :  And finally, the Oscar-winning actress Olivia Coleman
*31:49.600- 31:53.480* :  has said that she would be paid a lot more if she were a man.
*31:53.800- 31:56.720* :  The latest top 10 list of the best paid actors
*31:56.720- 32:00.580* :  contains just two women, our culture reporter Guy Lambert,
*32:00.900- 32:01.580* :  has more details.
*32:02.160- 32:03.940* :  The topic of equal pay in Hollywood
*32:03.940- 32:07.220* :  has been the subject of ongoing discussion for many years.
*32:07.540- 32:10.000* :  The debate worked its way firmly into the spotlight
*32:10.000- 32:13.280* :  after an email hack of Sony executives in 2014,
*32:13.720- 32:15.880* :  which revealed that Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams
*32:15.880- 32:19.080* :  were paid less than their male co-stars for American hustle.
*32:19.460- 32:22.320* :  Lawrence later wrote she didn't push for more during negotiations
*32:22.540- 32:25.420* :  because she didn't want to seem difficult or spoiled.
*32:25.980- 32:27.780* :  When Kevin Spacey was dropped from the film
*32:27.780- 32:30.520* :  all the money in the world following allegations against him,
*32:30.920- 32:33.120* :  it was revealed that the actor Mark Wahlberg
*32:33.120- 32:36.660* :  was paid $1.5 million to do reshoots,
