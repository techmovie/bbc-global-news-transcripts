*01:39.740- 01:45.200* :  A Valerie Sanderson and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 14th of March, these are our main stories.
*01:45.200- 01:50.960* :  At least 50 migrants are reported to have drowned the Mediterranean Sea trying to cross to Europe.
*01:51.500- 01:56.840* :  Israel has given more information about a planned ground assault on Raffa, including proposals
*01:56.840- 02:01.700* :  to move hundreds of thousands of Palestinians sheltering the city to the centre of Gaza.
*02:02.440- 02:06.820* :  Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg is on the campaign trail ahead of this weekend's
*02:07.020- 02:13.760* :  presidential election. Also in this podcast the British government unveils a new definition of
*02:13.760- 02:19.320* :  extremism and a new campaign hopes to give slugs an image makeover.
*02:19.680- 02:23.920* :  A slugs and snails are useful for a healthy garden. Many of the species you'll find in the garden
*02:23.920- 02:27.740* :  don't actually damage plants or don't cause much damage plants because they are their feeding
*02:27.740- 02:29.100* :  way on that rotting plant or two.
*02:32.580- 02:37.620* :  At least 50 migrants are reported of drowned trying to reach Europe from Libya after their
*02:37.620- 02:43.140* :  overloaded dinghy broke down. Survivors say the engine cut out three days into their crossing
*02:43.140- 02:49.800* :  of the Mediterranean Sea leaving the boat drift without food or water. 25 people were rescued by
*02:49.800- 02:55.120* :  a humanitarian group. Two who were unconscious were flown to Sicily for medical treatment
*02:55.120- 03:00.860* :  with the help of the Italian authorities but they didn't survive. Just before we recorded
*03:00.860- 03:06.460* :  this podcast I spoke to our room reporter Davide Gleone who's been speaking to rescues.
*03:07.100- 03:14.400* :  This is a huge tragedy once again dozens of people seeking a better future in Europe after
*03:14.400- 03:23.280* :  crossing the desert after spending months if not years in detention centres in Libya have died.
*03:23.280- 03:31.880* :  I was just talking to the rescues and they were telling me that they found 25 people who were
*03:31.880- 03:38.240* :  in a state of shock. They had petrol burns. They were highly dehydrated and they were really weak.
*03:38.240- 03:46.060* :  They couldn't even walk. Unfortunately only 23 of them survived and they were forced to throw
*03:46.060- 03:53.240* :  the bodies of the friends, the mothers, the sisters, the brothers overboard because they left
*03:53.240- 03:59.320* :  Libya about a week ago and the engine broke and the run out of water, the run out of food and
*03:59.320- 04:07.060* :  they were really really shocked. This is also one of the reasons why it's very hard at the moment
*04:07.060- 04:14.180* :  to establish how many people have died but we certainly do now that this is not the first time
*04:14.180- 04:20.660* :  and unfortunately not the last time that this happens. What is the Italian government doing to tackle
*04:20.660- 04:28.640* :  this? Obviously we do know that about years ago now George Romalloni who leads a far-right
*04:28.640- 04:35.680* :  government was elected and one of electoral promises was to tackle illegal migration. She wanted
*04:35.680- 04:43.940* :  to stop everyone from coming into Europe. She wanted to set up a never blockade and now numbers
*04:43.940- 04:51.420* :  of people trying to cross into Europe going up. She struggled at the beginning especially now.
*04:51.420- 04:57.940* :  She's trying to find alternative solutions and she's watered down some of her initial ideas but
*04:57.940- 05:05.840* :  still she worked on a plan with Albania so she's trying to build two processing centers in Albania
*05:06.200- 05:14.480* :  to process asylum applications and she's also trying minor solutions and humanitarian corridors
*05:14.480- 05:21.800* :  which is clearly not enough. The Israeli military have given more details on their plan
*05:21.800- 05:27.680* :  defensive against Hamas in Raffa in the south of the Gaza Strip. The Israeli defense force says it
*05:27.680- 05:33.180* :  plans to move nearly one and a half million Palestinians who fled to Raffa to what the Israelis
*05:33.180- 05:39.560* :  are calling humanitarian islands in the middle of the Strip. AD agencies say that safely moving
*05:39.560- 05:45.160* :  such a large number of people in a war zone would be almost impossible and an assault on Raffa
*05:45.160- 05:51.220* :  could prove disastrous. I spoke to Anna Foster who's in Jerusalem. What the Israeli army have said
*05:51.240- 05:57.020* :  is that they will move civilians who are sheltering in Raffa to what they're describing as humanitarian
*05:57.020- 06:03.680* :  islands in the center of the Gaza Strip and this is information and detail that we've been waiting
*06:03.680- 06:08.400* :  for because while Israel have said repeatedly on many occasions that they do intend to go ahead
*06:08.400- 06:13.520* :  with this military offensive in Raffa they haven't explained really how they will do it and
*06:13.520- 06:19.180* :  crucially how they will protect and shelter the civilian population who've been displaced there.
*06:19.480- 06:24.860* :  Rear Admiral Daniel Higari who's the spokesperson for the IDF he said that if people moved there
*06:24.860- 06:30.440* :  there would be temporary housing there would be aid that would be provided. Of course there are
*06:30.440- 06:36.140* :  you know lots of unanswered questions about exactly how this would work and I think the timescale
*06:36.140- 06:42.280* :  is important as well what they're describing cannot be achieved quickly it would take weeks to put
*06:42.280- 06:46.920* :  something like this into place because we are talking about one and a half million people that
*06:46.920- 06:53.320* :  they'd have to move that's right it's it's such a large scale operation but the international community
*06:53.320- 06:59.080* :  I think have made it vocally quite clear to Israel that it is something that is essential you
*06:59.080- 07:03.200* :  know when you think about it these are people who were living in the north and center of the strip
*07:03.580- 07:08.500* :  who were displaced during the fighting earlier in the war who were told they had to to move out of
*07:08.500- 07:12.960* :  the way of the fighting by the IDF and and when you look at the pictures of what life is like
*07:12.960- 07:18.260* :  there now you've got people living in tents there's very little aid there's no food the situation
*07:18.260- 07:24.600* :  is absolutely desperate and because people are now so tightly packed into that city on the very
*07:24.600- 07:30.840* :  southernmost tip of the Gaza Strip it would make some kind of large scale military ground operation
*07:30.840- 07:36.880* :  almost impossible without leading to to a large number of civilian casualties so that is why if
*07:36.880- 07:41.360* :  Israel is to go ahead and it says it has to if it's going to remove her mass fully from the Gaza
*07:41.360- 07:47.000* :  Strip it says it has to have an operation in Raffa in the southern tip of Gaza in order to do that
*07:47.000- 07:52.900* :  but I think the risks are clear and that is why Israel is being widely encouraged to to plan it
*07:52.900- 07:59.060* :  properly and to take its time and a foster in Jerusalem when Russians go to the polls on Friday
*07:59.060- 08:03.900* :  at the start of a three-day long presidential election the result will not be in doubt
*08:03.900- 08:10.360* :  Vladimir Putin faces no serious challenge in a vote his opponent say is neither free nor fair
*08:10.860- 08:14.880* :  he will be declared the winner and he'll secure six more years in the Kremlin
*08:15.280- 08:19.320* :  the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg has been to the time of Borovsk's
*08:19.320- 08:23.200* :  side of Moscow where two very different pictures of Russia are on display
*08:27.320- 08:34.620* :  from the Borovsk bell tower it's a short walk to a wooden house the home of 86-year-old artist
*08:34.720- 08:44.780* :  Vladimir of Chinikov when Vladimir paints a picture of Russia it comes out dark very dark
*08:45.640- 08:52.500* :  one of the paintings he's showing me features a mountain of human skulls another two meet grinders
*08:52.920- 08:59.700* :  one a symbol of lives destroyed in Stalin's terror the other in Russia's war in Ukraine
*09:02.880- 09:10.480* :  then he shows me photos of his anti-war street art those paintings get scrubbed out very quickly
*09:11.300- 09:18.160* :  on one wall he'd painted stop as missiles rain down on a girl dressed in Ukrainian blue and yellow
*09:18.220- 09:24.620* :  he's been fined twice for discrediting the Russian army Vladimir tells me that the war in
*09:24.620- 09:32.520* :  Ukraine is a crime I'd be condoning it he says if I stayed silent I ask him where he thinks Russia
*09:32.520- 09:43.220* :  is heading towards more repression he says and full dictatorship Vladimir of Chinikov says he
*09:43.220- 09:49.940* :  never watches Russian television but if he did he would see a very different picture of Russia
*09:50.300- 09:54.840* :  President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin
*09:56.640- 10:03.820* :  Russian state TV portrays Vladimir Putin as some kind of superhero a father of the nation figure
*10:04.760- 10:07.320* :  protecting Russia and forging a bright future
*10:10.520- 10:16.580* :  no mountains of skulls or meet grinders in sight just pure Putin centric positivity
*10:17.280- 10:23.420* :  in Russia the Kremlin calls the best democracy in the world just look at the presidential election
*10:23.420- 10:30.860* :  there are four candidates democracy in action but keep in mind Mr. Putin's fiercest critics aren't
*10:30.860- 10:38.240* :  running they're in exile or in prison or in Mr. Levine's case dead the three challenges
*10:38.760- 10:44.120* :  from the Kremlin friendly parliament posed no threat as I recently discovered
*10:47.320- 10:52.180* :  at a campaign rally by the communist party candidate Nikolai Haritonov
*10:53.580- 10:59.600* :  I managed to ask Mr. Haritonov why does he think he'd be a better president than Putin
*11:01.260- 11:05.180* :  it's not for me to say he replied that wouldn't be right
*11:06.700- 11:09.080* :  do you think your manifesto is better than Putin's
*11:10.960- 11:16.820* :  that's for voters to decide he said he wouldn't talk himself up something tells me
*11:17.180- 11:20.380* :  that Nikolai Haritonov's heart isn't in this race
*11:25.120- 11:29.440* :  back in Borovsk a man pulls a sledge and disappears into the distance
*11:30.620- 11:37.080* :  we've seen two very different pictures of Russia but how do they see things on the streets of
*11:37.160- 11:45.540* :  Borovsk no matter how you vote everything is decided in advance a young woman calls
*11:45.540- 11:52.220* :  fitlana says but many here tell me they will be voting and it becomes clear that the Russia
*11:52.220- 12:02.700* :  as seen on state TV has many supporters like Ludmilla I hope Vladimir Putin will win the election
*12:02.700- 12:08.940* :  and that the war will end Ludmilla tells me and when there's peace many countries will finally
*12:08.940- 12:17.240* :  understand that Russia is unbeatable Steve Rosenberg in Russia in Germany a former member of
*12:17.240- 12:23.020* :  the communist East German secret police the Stasi is going on trial for the murder of a Polish man
*12:23.020- 12:29.520* :  50 years ago the accused identified only as Martin N is alleged to have shot a Polish man
*12:29.520- 12:36.620* :  as he attempted to flee from east to west Berlin David McGinnis in Berlin has more it's taken 50
*12:36.620- 12:42.220* :  years for this case to come to trial but this morning an 80-year-old former Stasi officer appeared
*12:42.220- 12:48.840* :  in court accused of gunning down a Polish man Czesław Kukuchka as he tried to escape from East Berlin
*12:48.840- 12:54.500* :  to the west mr Kukuchka had gone to the Polish embassy in East Berlin earlier that day to
*12:54.500- 13:01.000* :  demand passage to west Berlin he was tricked by Stasi officers into thinking his request had been
*13:01.000- 13:06.660* :  granted they accompanied him to the nearby checkpoint at Friedrich Strasse train station
*13:07.180- 13:12.620* :  and are accused of shooting him in the back as he attempted to cross the border the trial is only
*13:12.620- 13:19.660* :  now possible in part because of new findings from the Stasi archives David McGinnis let's go to the
*13:19.660- 13:25.300* :  back garden now where gardeners here in the UK are being urged to reassess their relationship with
*13:25.900- 13:32.240* :  slugs the Royal Horticultural Society and the Wildlife Trust say while some species of slugs and
*13:32.240- 13:38.660* :  snails can decimate a garden the vast majority play a positive role the BBC's environment correspondent
*13:38.660- 13:44.720* :  Jonah Fisher has been to find out more at RHS Whizzley Garden in Surrey in the southeast of England
*13:45.500- 13:51.320* :  there's a definite sense that spring is in the air and that is of course the time when gardeners
*13:51.320- 13:57.200* :  around the country are starting to think about putting seeds seedlings in the ground and it's also
*13:57.200- 14:02.960* :  the start of what can be a pretty deadly battle between the gardener and the slug and the snail
*14:03.320- 14:09.060* :  the Royal Horticultural Society are suggesting we rethink how we manage slugs and snails in our
*14:09.060- 14:13.780* :  garden and the soul spirit here and you're looking right under the rocks here or a log in fact
*14:14.200- 14:18.300* :  what have you found well I've turned over this log here in the wildlife garden at Whizzley and
*14:18.300- 14:24.240* :  found that a number of species of slug are found in typical gardens and there's 40 odd species
*14:24.240- 14:30.200* :  that you might find in the garden and you're the head of plant health here surely having lots of
*14:30.200- 14:35.420* :  slugs in your garden cannot coexist well with having healthy parts that's not quite true
*14:35.440- 14:39.720* :  as such in snails are useful for our healthy garden many of the species you'll find in the garden
*14:39.720- 14:43.500* :  don't actually damage plants or don't cause much damage plants because they are there feeding
*14:43.500- 14:48.100* :  away on that rotting plant material even rotting animal material and even that fox poo you might find
*14:48.100- 14:52.400* :  in your garden you might find the slugs are helping recycle that so they're really important for
*14:52.400- 14:56.980* :  nutrient recycling in the garden they also have lots of natural enemies so there's lots of
*14:57.240- 15:01.880* :  beetles you've got birds such as a trash which feed on snails so they are vital to that sort of
*15:01.960- 15:08.900* :  healthy balance in the garden what sort of things work in terms of keeping slugs out without
*15:08.900- 15:13.300* :  necessarily killing them maybe not think about keeping them out entirely and accepting a bit of
*15:13.300- 15:17.680* :  damage get those natural enemies and that balance going but you can also try some of those barriers
*15:18.100- 15:22.020* :  and also maybe grow on your plants a bit more before you plant them out so they are more able to
*15:22.020- 15:26.900* :  cope with the damage and any slugs as they are so we're going to take some pellets or a real no no
*15:27.000- 15:31.020* :  some pellets yes with these days we don't really recommend them at the RHS because they do have
*15:31.020- 15:34.760* :  effects they they not only kill those slugs which might be damaging your plants but they all
*15:34.760- 15:39.360* :  kill all the other slugs which are useful in the garden too this is to be quite frank a massive
*15:39.360- 15:44.820* :  rebranding is it to try and turn what is not the most beautiful of creature can I say that
*15:45.260- 15:49.880* :  and something with devastating crops into something which we're going to actually love
*15:50.140- 15:53.560* :  you just look at some of the colors here and so you know they've got a nice yellow slug up at
*15:53.560- 15:58.120* :  the top here there are leopard slugs with lots of leopard-like patterns like the name suggests
*15:58.600- 16:02.660* :  and you start looking into that hundred or so species of sail that are in the UK there are some
*16:02.660- 16:08.980* :  fascinating patterns out there and they are part of the garden and you saw spray from the RHS
*16:08.980- 16:17.380* :  ending that report by Jennifer still to come in this podcast how do we prevent one of humanity's
*16:17.380- 16:24.000* :  greatest achievements from turning into a nightmare we hear a great deal about an aging society which
*16:24.000- 16:29.540* :  tends to be about decline a rising number of older people but the real change is that all of us
*16:29.960- 16:33.840* :  on average can expect to live a lot longer and need to invest more in our future to make it a good

*18:07.180- 18:18.400* :  BBC podcasts in Britain a senior government minister has told parliament that the government's
*18:18.400- 18:24.540* :  new definition of extremism is more precise and rigorous than the previous one Michael Goves
*18:24.540- 18:29.520* :  said ministers had taken every possible precaution to strike a balance between protecting
*18:29.520- 18:35.220* :  fundamental rights and safeguarding citizens but critics have warned that the change could inhibit
*18:35.220- 18:40.620* :  free speech and unfairly target Muslim groups the main opposition labour party said it would
*18:40.620- 18:46.980* :  scrutinise how the definition is applied in practice Henry Zethman reports Michael Goves said the
*18:46.980- 18:51.640* :  new definition was a sign of the government being clear-eyed about the threat we face and
*18:51.640- 18:56.560* :  precise about where the threat comes from the definition states that a group will now be deemed
*18:56.560- 19:02.000* :  extremist if it promotes an ideology based on violence hatred or intolerance which aims to
*19:02.000- 19:06.960* :  destroy the fundamental rights and freedoms of others or undermine the UK's system of democracy
*19:07.840- 19:13.000* :  this is not a new legal standard but instead a set of tests which will be used within weeks
*19:13.000- 19:18.040* :  to produce a list of groups the government sees as extreme it would then treat them as such

*19:51.520- 19:57.380* :  indicted or sanctioned there's an urgent need to set up the transitional council in order for
*19:57.380- 20:03.880* :  elections to go ahead the United Nations says it's begun evacuating non-essential staff it also
*20:03.880- 20:09.140* :  said it was setting up an air bridge from neighboring Dominican Republic and it's from the border
*20:09.140- 20:17.020* :  between Haiti and the Dominican Republic that will grant centers this report even at Haiti's
*20:17.020- 20:22.820* :  lowest-ed migration trucks keep coming to the Dacabon border crossing scores of undocumented
*20:22.820- 20:28.700* :  Haitians some of whom have spent years living in the Dominican Republic are deported to a nation
*20:28.700- 20:35.880* :  in turmoil some angry some resigned but they're all going back across the border straight into a
*20:35.880- 20:43.460* :  nation in crisis a country actually living its worst moment most acute humanitarian crisis since
*20:43.460- 20:53.040* :  the 2010 earthquake Michael Petiton says he spent three years as a
*20:53.040- 20:57.260* :  construction worker in the Dominican Republic before the authorities entered his home and
*20:57.260- 21:03.440* :  detained him in essence it seems the Dominican government is sending a message no matter how bad
*21:03.440- 21:08.780* :  things get in Haiti its people should not expect to find refuge in its neighbor's territory the
*21:08.780- 21:15.920* :  current situation the border plays the capital city of Haiti is a humanitarian catastrophe for
*21:15.940- 21:21.600* :  its three million inhabitants and more specifically for women and girls and things are currently very
*21:21.600- 21:29.600* :  bad says the UN population funds Haiti representative Philippe Serge Digenier out of the 15 hospitals
*21:29.600- 21:36.620* :  that UNFPA is supporting only one is currently functioning and is completely overwhelmed by the
*21:36.620- 21:43.360* :  situation we have estimated that about three thousand women will not have access to
*21:44.060- 21:48.820* :  maternity in order to give birth if the situation is not calming down
*21:51.620- 21:56.700* :  for so many in Haiti life is now a critical struggle to find enough food or to make ends meet
*21:57.300- 22:02.540* :  furthermore the UNFPA warns that rape and sexual abuse are being used as weapons of war in
*22:02.540- 22:10.180* :  the Haitian capital last year more than five thousand women were raped or victim of sexual abuse
*22:11.120- 22:17.420* :  and that is unfortunately a very tiny part of the iceberg most of the time women don't
*22:17.580- 22:23.560* :  dare to go to the hospital to be treated because they may be some retaliation and sometimes
*22:23.560- 22:29.100* :  retaliation goes up to killing the this poor woman a bit more space and submit
*22:33.360- 22:38.420* :  regional diplomats see the resignation of prime minister Adriel Henry which he confirmed on
*22:38.420- 22:44.040* :  Monday as the first step towards stability we expect that the members of the transitional
*22:44.040- 22:49.120* :  council will be appointed in the next 24 to 48 hours the U.S. State Department confidently
*22:49.120- 22:54.280* :  spoke of a transitional council being in place within two days there's still no sign of one
*22:54.680- 22:59.400* :  and while most important prints are glad to see the back of Ariel Henry many are frustrated
*22:59.400- 23:08.060* :  at the lack of a clear plan on these resignation is a good thing says Ms Benjamin a storeholder
*23:08.520- 23:13.140* :  he wasn't doing anything good for this country now we must unite to pull Haiti out of this
*23:17.480- 23:22.900* :  Adriel Henry was the biggest obstacle we had he had to go as another resident in Manouin
*23:23.480- 23:25.660* :  but we should have had a proper plan to replace him
*23:29.860- 23:33.920* :  at the land crossing between the Dominican Republic and Haiti Dominican soldiers
*23:33.920- 23:39.140* :  wheeled tasers at the returning Haitians there's a long and bitter history between these two
*23:39.140- 23:44.880* :  nations which share a Caribbean island and even with Haiti on the brink of collapse only a handful
*23:44.880- 23:50.760* :  of Haitians are being allowed to leave meanwhile for the thousands being deported into Haiti each day
*23:51.320- 23:54.380* :  the future has rarely looked so uncertain or dangerous
*23:57.120- 24:02.760* :  Will Grant to South Africa where tempers are fraying in the city of Cape Town over the issue of
*24:02.760- 24:08.960* :  so-called digital nomads people who can work from anywhere because they only need a laptop Cape
*24:09.000- 24:13.680* :  Town has become a favorite destination and critics say they're pushing up prices in the city
*24:14.220- 24:19.300* :  being truly digital savvy they of course share their stories on social media platforms
*24:19.300- 24:25.040* :  like this montage on TikTok me and my best friend moved to South Africa to spend our first day
*24:25.040- 24:29.040* :  together living and working in Cape Town okay if you're coming to Cape Town here's everything
*24:29.040- 24:32.920* :  you need to know so you want to move to Cape Town South Africa where the cost of living is 66%
*24:32.920- 24:38.160* :  lower than the US Cape Town is one of my favorite destinations I've ever worked from and that's
*24:38.160- 24:43.420* :  really saying something the South African government has been encouraging digital nomads to visit
*24:43.420- 24:50.440* :  by introducing a special visa for international workers who can work remotely it's in draft form at
*24:50.440- 24:55.760* :  the moment but it illustrates the government's positive view of these workers who they say boost
*24:55.760- 25:03.120* :  the economy but at what cost to local communities Brandon Van Reenan is a Tik Toker in Cape Town
*25:03.520- 25:08.600* :  and he outlines the problem facing locals you know South Africa and Cape Town in particular has become
*25:08.600- 25:13.540* :  a major hotspot for digital nomads from the US and Europe and Australia because of the cost of
*25:13.940- 25:18.180* :  living on their dollar and their pounds in the euro salary is really affordable and now the
*25:18.180- 25:22.740* :  government has proposed amendments to the immigration regulations to make it easier to attract
*25:23.640- 25:28.100* :  and in some cases they might even be exempt from paying in local tax while they year and I think
*25:28.100- 25:33.120* :  while we can appreciate that there's a tremendous upside for the local economy where digital nomads
*25:33.120- 25:38.140* :  do spend their money on accommodation and dining and recreation what we're seeing in Cape Town right
*25:38.140- 25:42.560* :  now is that the cost of living is rising very quickly and locals are being priced out of those
*25:42.560- 25:47.900* :  things where it's hitting Cape Town as the hardest though is rent so lots of property owners are now
*25:47.900- 25:53.300* :  pricing their rent for digital nomads and in some part of the city rent has gone up 20% to 30%
*25:53.300- 25:59.480* :  just from the pandemic and even in some middle income neighborhoods now you can have a room not a flat
*25:59.480- 26:05.840* :  just a room go for the equivalent of what is essentially 360 pounds and an entire apartment in the
*26:05.840- 26:11.080* :  same area is around double that and that's just far too expensive for the typical Cape Townian
*26:11.080- 26:16.420* :  who earns an average around 850 pounds a month so it's just creating an environment where people
*26:16.420- 26:21.420* :  are needing to move further away from business hubs to more affordable suburbs and and oftentimes
*26:21.420- 26:27.560* :  those suburbs have fewer amenities and in some cases support a service delivery. Brandon Van Rienen
*26:27.560- 26:34.740* :  in Cape Town one of the most profound changes in the 21st century both individually and socially
*26:35.240- 26:41.400* :  is the very large number of people living until they're very old really old like a hundred or so
*26:41.420- 26:48.500* :  the key question is how do we all live well for longer a new book The Longevity and Imperative
*26:48.500- 26:54.540* :  outlines the innovations needed to make the most of our longer life expectancy. Justin Webb spoke
*26:54.540- 26:59.320* :  to the author Andrew Scott professor of economics at the London Business School and to Joan
*26:59.320- 27:05.320* :  Bakewell a littering star of British cultural life for many years who has spoken extensively
*27:05.320- 27:11.600* :  on keeping busy at 90. First we hear from Andrew. Well I hope it's about a novel idea which is for
*27:11.600- 27:16.240* :  the first time ever in human history the young in the middle age can expect to become old. We
*27:16.240- 27:20.840* :  have of course always had old people but it's only a minority who lived that long and we need to
*27:20.840- 27:25.420* :  ensure that the longer lives we can now expect aren't just longer but healthier for longer,
*27:25.900- 27:30.900* :  productive for longer and engage for longer for us to seize the opportunity. We hear a great deal
*27:30.900- 27:35.820* :  about an aging society which tends to be about decline, a rising number of older people
*27:36.480- 27:41.380* :  but the real change is that all of us on average can expect to live a lot longer and need to invest
*27:41.380- 27:45.880* :  more in our future to make it a good one. Yeah it's that new period isn't it, Joan Bakewell,
*27:45.880- 27:50.560* :  that new period that opens up now for so many people and we've never really addressed properly.
*27:51.260- 27:55.980* :  Yes I mean there is a great burst of energy that comes when your children have grown up and left
*27:55.980- 28:02.140* :  home when your routine job the one that you had and for which you grew a pension has finished
*28:02.760- 28:09.600* :  and you have all your stamina remaining. I mean old people enjoy a great burst of energy very often
*28:09.600- 28:15.680* :  a great many of them go into the world of volunteering so there is a resource there that is not
*28:15.680- 28:21.260* :  being used to the benefit of society, not alone the well-being of the people themselves.
*28:21.980- 28:29.660* :  And emotionally at that level, Joan, for people who are in that position with so much still
*28:30.060- 28:35.580* :  to give the idea that it's not given or not asked for or not noticed is going to be an outrage
*28:35.580- 28:40.200* :  isn't it, if they're more and more obvious? It's worse than that really because one of the problems
*28:40.200- 28:47.560* :  of old people now in society is isolation and loneliness. Very often a partner might die,
*28:47.560- 28:54.640* :  you're left alone in your home with no function in society at all to give you any sense of purpose.
*28:55.160- 29:01.180* :  So it's a really important social development to include people as they grow older,
*29:01.540- 29:05.900* :  let alone use their skills and wisdom to help society generally.
*29:06.100- 29:11.480* :  Which Andrew Scott is easy to say but what in practical terms do we need to do that we don't do
*29:11.480- 29:15.600* :  at the moment? Well it's a very profound change and we really have to change the course of life so
*29:15.600- 29:18.780* :  it's not going to happen quickly. There's lots of things that can happen. We've got to stop
*29:18.780- 29:23.680* :  underestimating the capacity of older people. We are now likely to get old. We worry about getting
*29:23.680- 29:28.360* :  old so what do we do now? And that's about changes in our health system that focuses on health and
*29:28.360- 29:32.960* :  not treating illness. It's about making sure that people can carry on working, not necessarily
*29:32.960- 29:36.560* :  beyond the state pension age, but right now loads of people have to leave work before 50.
*29:37.260- 29:41.020* :  So it's really about recognising that aging is a process, not something that happens when you
*29:41.020- 29:46.060* :  hit 65 and that we really have to make sure we age better on every dimension and invest more
*29:46.060- 29:50.260* :  in our future. And not necessarily medicalising that process. I think one of the big problems is
*29:50.260- 29:54.300* :  we have medicalised the concept of old age. We see it only in terms of decline and as Joan was
*29:54.300- 29:58.500* :  saying, old age isn't just about decline. There's loads of things that happen and in fact on average
*29:59.120- 30:03.640* :  people in their 80s are a lot happier than people in their 40s and 50s so that there's a problem.
*30:03.680- 30:06.960* :  Well that's an interesting thought isn't it Joan, finally, and a positive one?
*30:07.340- 30:10.920* :  Yes, I thought it was interesting to see research shows that people are less
*30:10.920- 30:15.840* :  happy in middle-aged and they are in old age. I think in old age you've solved a lot of
*30:16.160- 30:21.200* :  the problems that you've had. Dame Joan Bigwell and Professor Andrew Scott.
*30:22.500- 30:28.040* :  Next to Sweden, famous for musicians like Abba and the late DJ Evichi. The streaming giants,
*30:28.040- 30:33.620* :  Spotify and SoundCloud were born in Stockholm and now more startups are springing up.
*30:34.200- 30:38.700* :  Maddie Savage is in the Swedish capital and she met one of the new music tech businesses
*30:38.700- 30:45.080* :  that's creating a buzz in Stockholm and beyond. We're starting a few blocks away from Spotify
*30:45.800- 30:49.580* :  at a startup that's disrupting the way new artists are discovered.
*30:51.520- 30:57.300* :  Hi. Hey Maddie, this is the Snuffle Records Global Headquarters. That's Ankit Desai,
*30:57.300- 31:04.920* :  the CEO and co-founder of the company. So Snuffle Records is the first AI-enabled music label
*31:04.920- 31:11.220* :  in the world. I set it up because I saw that 70% of all the music consumption in the world
*31:11.220- 31:15.700* :  was between the three kind of major labels, Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony.
*31:16.300- 31:20.480* :  Even at that time in 2019 when we started the company they accounted for less than 1%
*31:20.480- 31:25.060* :  of all the new music that was coming out in the world. So the idea was maybe we can have
*31:25.060- 31:29.220* :  an algorithm that listens to all the music in the world and find those undervalued artists
*31:29.700- 31:35.260* :  and give them a platform to shine. So how did you create that platform? The very very first
*31:35.260- 31:44.060* :  version was super rudimentary. I basically made a program that scanned through all the new music
*31:44.060- 31:48.580* :  Friday playlists on Spotify. So every Friday there's a playlist with all the new music coming
*31:48.580- 31:52.140* :  out in the world and then we would track how they grew the following week.
*31:54.860- 32:00.400* :  These days the algorithm includes data from Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, SoundCloud,
*32:00.400- 32:07.620* :  tracking millions of songs each week. And we look at the behavior patterns of those people listening
*32:07.620- 32:14.100* :  to those artists. So we look at how many people found the song and after they found the song how
*32:14.100- 32:18.940* :  many people came back to listen again. When they talk about the artist how passionate are the words
*32:18.940- 32:24.460* :  that they use. We also look at the structure of the song. So essentially we built an algorithm that
*32:24.460- 32:31.220* :  incorporates all of these things and then is able to predict if an artist is quote-unquote undervalued
*32:31.220- 32:38.200* :  or not and try to find those diamonds and the rough. What happens next? We will reach out to the
*32:38.200- 32:42.940* :  artist to their manager and we'll say hey you know we think that we could help you amplify your
*32:42.940- 32:47.860* :  music and your voice and your talents. You know why don't you partner up with Nafu? We'll buy
*32:47.860- 32:52.480* :  some of your rights and together we'll split the profits when you when you increase.
*32:53.460- 33:02.280* :  So a traditional record label will take anywhere between 80 to 85% of the profits. So already it's
*33:02.280- 33:06.840* :  much better deal that the artist gets when they join Nafu and the reason we're able to do that is
*33:07.320- 33:11.900* :  because we're only digital we don't need to have the cost of having offices in 65 different
*33:11.900- 33:17.100* :  countries. We can run everything from Stockholm and we can run global campaigns across Latin America
*33:17.100- 33:22.240* :  Africa India and so on and that allows us to save money which we then pass on to the artist.
*33:25.320- 33:31.160* :  Five years after launching, Nafu records isn't yet profitable but it's had some big name investors
*33:31.760- 33:37.520* :  including Agneta Feldskock the actual Agneta from ABBA and it raised another seven million
*33:37.520- 33:43.100* :  dollars last year. That's impressive at a time when the jittery global economy is impacting a lot
*33:43.100- 33:50.400* :  of startup funding. Maddie Savage in Stockholm and more music news now the Glastonbury festival here
