*01:23.780- 01:26.880* :  I'm Andrew Peach, and at 13 hours GMT on Monday,
*01:26.880- 01:29.100* :  the 8th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:29.620- 01:32.640* :  The military in Myanmar has begun calling up Rohingya Muslims
*01:32.640- 01:36.600* :  to fight for the army, despite subjecting them to years of persecution.
*01:37.340- 01:39.980* :  More than 10,000 homes are underwater in Russia,
*01:39.980- 01:42.280* :  as flooding from the Ural Mountains spreads.
*01:43.060- 01:44.640* :  And Boeing faces more problems,
*01:44.640- 01:47.920* :  as a part from one of its planes, falls off mid-flight.
*01:50.100- 01:52.900* :  Also in this podcast, eBay says it'll drop fees
*01:52.900- 01:56.120* :  for people selling old clothes to stop them going to landfill.
*01:56.540- 01:57.160* :  And...
*01:57.400- 01:59.080* :  For me, really, the villains of the film
*01:59.120- 02:00.480* :  is addiction and paparazzi.
*02:09.880- 02:12.820* :  The movie, which asks what drove the singer Amy Winehouse
*02:12.820- 02:13.820* :  to an early death?
*02:18.080- 02:20.800* :  It's seven years since the Rohingya people of Western Myanmar
*02:20.800- 02:22.960* :  suffered unspeakable massacres.
*02:23.300- 02:25.180* :  The exact death toll isn't known,
*02:25.180- 02:27.460* :  but it's been estimated that the Myanmar army
*02:27.460- 02:30.220* :  probably murdered more than 25,000 people,
*02:30.660- 02:33.180* :  prompting more than a million others to flee the country
*02:33.180- 02:34.580* :  into neighboring Bangladesh.
*02:35.280- 02:37.340* :  The Rohingya had long suffered discrimination
*02:37.500- 02:39.600* :  and were never given citizenship of Myanmar,
*02:40.100- 02:41.740* :  although most had lived there for generations.
*02:42.180- 02:43.620* :  But despite not being citizens,
*02:44.100- 02:47.620* :  the BBC has found that hundreds of Rohingya have now been conscripted
*02:47.620- 02:49.280* :  to fight for Myanmar's army.
*02:49.780- 02:51.320* :  The investigation was carried out by
*02:51.320- 02:53.660* :  Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head.
*02:54.080- 02:56.060* :  It looks like this is a systematic attempt
*02:56.060- 02:59.280* :  to fill the ranks that have been depleted across Myanmar
*02:59.280- 03:01.240* :  as the army has been driven back
*03:01.240- 03:02.640* :  and suffered defeat after defeat.
*03:02.640- 03:05.160* :  Lots of surrenders, lots of soldiers killed.
*03:05.600- 03:06.340* :  They're really struggling.
*03:06.340- 03:08.260* :  They've been forced conscription across the country.
*03:08.820- 03:11.320* :  Nobody ever thought that they would bring in the Rohingyas.
*03:11.320- 03:12.900* :  The Rohingyas are viewed with contempt,
*03:13.540- 03:16.620* :  openly racist contempt by most of the military elite.
*03:17.100- 03:18.720* :  They view them as not belonging in Myanmar,
*03:18.720- 03:20.860* :  the ones who live still in Rakhine state
*03:20.860- 03:24.200* :  who weren't driven out in that ghastly kind of ethnic cleansing
*03:24.200- 03:25.120* :  that you referred to.
*03:25.200- 03:27.600* :  Many of them are confined to these really squalid camps,
*03:27.600- 03:29.120* :  about 150,000 of them.
*03:29.540- 03:31.320* :  And they're telling us that teams of military may
*03:31.320- 03:33.740* :  go around since mid-February and telling them
*03:33.740- 03:35.840* :  they have to join up, they have to go for training
*03:35.840- 03:37.440* :  and after two weeks of training
*03:37.440- 03:38.980* :  where they're taught how to use a rifle,
*03:38.980- 03:41.740* :  they've been thrown into some pretty fierce battles.
*03:42.260- 03:44.440* :  Now you have to understand that in Rakhine states
*03:44.440- 03:46.440* :  where there was this ethnic cleansing,
*03:46.440- 03:48.920* :  there is now a full-scale civil war
*03:48.920- 03:50.300* :  involving the other ethnic group,
*03:50.300- 03:51.720* :  they're the Rakhine Buddhists who are backing
*03:51.720- 03:53.680* :  an insurgent group called the Arachan army
*03:53.980- 03:55.400* :  and they've been having tremendous successes.
*03:55.400- 03:57.280* :  They've taken control of much of the state.
*03:57.680- 03:58.800* :  The army is on the run,
*03:58.800- 04:00.960* :  they've lost control of most of the northern parts
*04:00.960- 04:02.340* :  and central parts of Rakhine,
*04:02.780- 04:03.880* :  and they're desperate to hold on
*04:03.880- 04:05.520* :  and they're now forcing these Rohingyas
*04:05.520- 04:08.440* :  who they once tried to wipe out and drive out of the country
*04:08.820- 04:09.480* :  to fight for them.
*04:09.480- 04:10.300* :  It's very, very grim.
*04:10.300- 04:11.760* :  The Rohingyas feel absolutely desperate.
*04:11.760- 04:13.360* :  They've not been given a choice to their families
*04:13.360- 04:14.020* :  who've been threatened.
*04:14.600- 04:16.120* :  Those who've been in combat say
*04:16.120- 04:18.120* :  the experience was so gruelling and awful.
*04:18.540- 04:20.380* :  The one man was in an 11-day battle
*04:20.380- 04:22.040* :  to hold on to three military posts
*04:22.040- 04:23.380* :  in a town called Ratadon.
*04:23.700- 04:24.520* :  Before they were driven out,
*04:24.520- 04:26.020* :  he's been injured in both legs
*04:26.020- 04:28.160* :  and he's hiding now trying to avoid
*04:28.160- 04:29.960* :  being sent back to the front line.
*04:30.220- 04:31.800* :  The Rohingyas just feel that they're caught
*04:31.800- 04:33.000* :  in the middle of this fight
*04:33.000- 04:34.980* :  and that they're unwitting partners in it.
*04:35.240- 04:37.860* :  Given how they're seen by most people in the military,
*04:37.860- 04:39.500* :  as you said, the fear presumably
*04:39.500- 04:41.900* :  is that they're just gonna be used as cannon fodder, aren't they?
*04:41.900- 04:43.320* :  I mean, their military's not gonna care
*04:43.320- 04:44.280* :  if they live or die.
*04:44.780- 04:46.000* :  No, and that's the fear that actually
*04:46.000- 04:48.220* :  everyone in Myanmar has about conscription.
*04:48.380- 04:50.540* :  The military Myanmar has been fighting wars
*04:50.540- 04:52.200* :  against ethnic insurgents for decades
*04:52.360- 04:53.720* :  and they do it old-style
*04:53.720- 04:54.680* :  and I've seen it myself.
*04:54.680- 04:56.280* :  It is like trench warfare.
*04:56.280- 04:57.800* :  They just throw waves of men in.
*04:57.800- 04:59.140* :  They always lose huge numbers.
*04:59.540- 05:01.680* :  It's why young men are fleeing the country
*05:01.680- 05:03.120* :  to avoid this conscription law,
*05:03.120- 05:04.400* :  but these Rohingyas have no choice.
*05:04.740- 05:06.980* :  They've been confined to these camps for 12 years.
*05:06.980- 05:08.540* :  They're not allowed to move without permission.
*05:08.920- 05:09.980* :  So they're completely trapped.
*05:10.380- 05:11.940* :  They are being used as cannon fodder,
*05:12.240- 05:14.260* :  but there's a more problematic consequence of this
*05:14.260- 05:16.000* :  and I think the military's well aware of this.
*05:16.380- 05:18.440* :  Traditionally, there are very difficult relations
*05:18.440- 05:20.720* :  between the Rohingya Muslims and the Rakhine Buddhists
*05:20.720- 05:22.080* :  who, of course, back in this insurgency.
*05:22.580- 05:24.060* :  That was also part of the fuel
*05:24.060- 05:26.120* :  behind the ethnic cleansing in 2017.
*05:26.120- 05:28.220* :  That tension has died down
*05:28.440- 05:30.100* :  and this Rakhine Buddhist insurgent army
*05:30.100- 05:32.400* :  is talking about a more consulatory approach
*05:32.440- 05:34.380* :  and perhaps thinking about bringing Rohingyas back
*05:34.380- 05:36.160* :  from Bangladesh, but now the Rohingyas
*05:36.160- 05:37.560* :  are fighting on the army side
*05:37.720- 05:39.080* :  albeit very unwillingly.
*05:39.460- 05:41.060* :  That is creating ethnic tension.
*05:41.120- 05:43.200* :  It's likely to cause serious problems
*05:43.200- 05:44.360* :  between these two communities
*05:44.920- 05:46.780* :  and the Arakanari looks like it's going to take control
*05:46.780- 05:47.520* :  of Rakhine State
*05:47.560- 05:49.480* :  and it's going to take a very dim view of Rohingyas
*05:49.480- 05:51.780* :  who it's found itself fighting against in these battles.
*05:52.380- 05:54.700* :  A correspondent Jonathan Head with Paul Moss.
*05:55.560- 05:57.500* :  Russia's emergency ministry says
*05:57.500- 05:59.780* :  flooding from the Ural mountains is spreading.
*06:00.220- 06:02.320* :  39 regions across Siberia,
*06:02.320- 06:04.320* :  the Volga region and central parts of Russia
*06:04.320- 06:05.640* :  are becoming inundated,
*06:05.960- 06:08.320* :  leaving more than 10,000 homes underwater
*06:08.940- 06:10.440* :  and it's not just Russia being affected
*06:10.440- 06:11.840* :  on the other side of the mountains,
*06:11.840- 06:15.120* :  75,000 people have been evacuated from their homes
*06:15.120- 06:16.360* :  in northern Kazakhstan.
*06:17.040- 06:19.020* :  Our Europe Regional Editor, Nikki Cardwell,
*06:19.020- 06:20.240* :  has been following developments.
*06:20.940- 06:22.820* :  Basically, anywhere that is downstream
*06:23.060- 06:26.260* :  of the Ural River is getting run off.
*06:26.400- 06:28.320* :  So that's 18,000 kilometers
*06:28.960- 06:31.420* :  from the Ural mountains down to the Caspian Sea.
*06:31.720- 06:33.280* :  This is a climate issue
*06:33.280- 06:35.840* :  and it's been several months of unseasable weather
*06:35.840- 06:38.080* :  and the autumn they had torrential rains
*06:38.540- 06:40.040* :  which promptly froze.
*06:40.300- 06:41.900* :  They had temperatures of minus 10.
*06:42.280- 06:43.900* :  So instead of that water running off,
*06:44.000- 06:47.180* :  it froze in the soil and then it snowed on top of it
*06:47.180- 06:48.440* :  because that's what happens in the winter
*06:48.940- 06:50.120* :  and they've just had a heat wave.
*06:50.220- 06:51.600* :  So all of that snow and ice
*06:51.900- 06:54.180* :  has thawed over a very short space of time
*06:54.520- 06:55.980* :  and it's all heading down river.
*06:56.560- 07:00.000* :  Vladimir Putin is a climate change skeptic.
*07:00.000- 07:02.720* :  So what if anything is the Russian government saying?
*07:03.180- 07:04.760* :  He was a climate skeptic
*07:04.800- 07:06.840* :  but he's changed his tune recently
*07:06.840- 07:09.860* :  and he's starting to embrace a lot of these issues.
*07:09.920- 07:12.180* :  In fact, he's told Russia he wants them to prepare
*07:12.180- 07:14.060* :  for these climate issues that occur
*07:14.060- 07:16.840* :  and weather phenomena that we're seeing all over the world.
*07:16.840- 07:21.220* :  So he sent his emergency minister to fly to the area
*07:21.620- 07:22.540* :  to coordinate coverage.
*07:22.540- 07:25.340* :  They've also been releasing footage of what's going on there
*07:25.340- 07:26.840* :  which is very unusual from the Kremlin.
*07:27.380- 07:29.960* :  So they do seem to be trying to get a grip on this.
*07:30.160- 07:31.260* :  And in terms of Kazakhstan,
*07:31.500- 07:34.100* :  it sounds if anything like the situation's even worse.
*07:34.280- 07:35.980* :  It is, it's covering a much wider area.
*07:35.980- 07:38.440* :  Earlier on the BBC spoke to the Deputy Foreign Minister
*07:38.440- 07:40.600* :  of Kazakhstan, Roman Vasylenko,
*07:41.020- 07:42.760* :  he says they're doing everything they can
*07:42.760- 07:44.020* :  to help those affected.
*07:44.580- 07:46.620* :  We had floods in 2012, 2017,
*07:46.720- 07:49.640* :  but this is the most serious flooding in 80 years.
*07:49.860- 07:51.800* :  More than 75,000 people,
*07:51.980- 07:55.140* :  including 17,000 children have so far been evacuated.
*07:55.340- 07:59.260* :  But 65 villages and settlements remain still cut off.
*07:59.580- 08:02.860* :  So this is a huge number of people affected by these floods.
*08:03.380- 08:05.540* :  What are the water implications of what's happening?
*08:05.800- 08:07.540* :  There are issues beyond what's happening
*08:07.540- 08:08.960* :  to people on the ground.
*08:08.960- 08:12.720* :  Kazakhstan is one of the world's biggest producers of uranium.
*08:12.720- 08:16.360* :  And over the weekend, we saw the markets reacting to concerns
*08:16.360- 08:20.340* :  that they may not be able to carry on producing this amount.
*08:20.600- 08:21.940* :  We saw alternative suppliers,
*08:21.940- 08:23.500* :  the value of their stocks going up.
*08:23.940- 08:25.940* :  But the implications for fuel prices,
*08:26.120- 08:27.460* :  for places like France,
*08:27.500- 08:29.360* :  where they rely on nuclear energy,
*08:29.360- 08:33.060* :  if they can't get their uranium fuel tablets,
*08:33.600- 08:35.180* :  then there will be implications
*08:35.800- 08:37.700* :  for people much further in the region.
*08:38.220- 08:39.400* :  Nikki Cardwell reporting.
*08:40.060- 08:42.860* :  It's now two years since invading Russian troops
*08:42.860- 08:46.080* :  were forced out of the Ukrainian town of Buccia near Kiev.
*08:46.560- 08:48.180* :  You might remember the reporting at the time
*08:48.180- 08:50.080* :  about dozens of civilian bodies
*08:50.420- 08:51.540* :  strewn across the street.
*08:52.160- 08:53.740* :  Our eastern Europe correspondents,
*08:53.740- 08:55.700* :  Sarah Rainesford, has been back to Buccia
*08:55.900- 08:58.120* :  to find some of the people she met two years ago.
*08:58.660- 09:02.420* :  I'm going to have to live now.
*09:03.160- 09:05.680* :  When Russian soldiers killed Ludmila's husband,
*09:06.140- 09:07.580* :  she had to wrap him in a blanket
*09:08.100- 09:09.580* :  and bury him in their garden.
*09:11.520- 09:14.420* :  This was Valyar's second burial at the town's cemetery.
*09:15.780- 09:19.640* :  It was 2022 after Ukrainian forces had liberated Buccia
*09:20.020- 09:21.540* :  from a month under occupation.
*09:22.380- 09:24.480* :  What they discovered there shocked the world.
*09:25.020- 09:26.580* :  Masha, Masha, yeah.
*09:26.640- 09:28.520* :  Right in the yard, he was раскreling.
*09:29.380- 09:30.660* :  I've always remembered the story
*09:30.660- 09:33.940* :  Ludmila told me then by the side of Valyar's grave.
*09:35.000- 09:36.740* :  How Russian troops had driven a tank
*09:36.740- 09:39.740* :  into the pensioners yard and taken over their house.
*09:41.180- 09:42.700* :  The couple hid in their cellar,
*09:43.220- 09:44.420* :  but when Valyar emerged,
*09:44.580- 09:46.880* :  he was shot in the back of the head.
*09:52.460- 09:53.960* :  Two years later, I found Ludmila
*09:54.240- 09:54.900* :  at her home,
*09:55.580- 09:57.040* :  but it's now a construction site.
*09:57.760- 10:00.440* :  The couple's house was destroyed in the battle for Buccia
*10:00.800- 10:02.100* :  and it's slowly being rebuilt
*10:02.660- 10:05.420* :  as part of a giant restoration project for the town.
*10:06.200- 10:07.980* :  Ludmila is anxious for it to be ready,
*10:08.060- 10:10.600* :  but when it is, she'll live there alone.
*10:12.220- 10:14.040* :  When I ask how she's coping,
*10:14.040- 10:17.280* :  she says she has high blood pressure now and heart problems.
*10:18.000- 10:19.960* :  She blames the stress and the memories.
*10:24.080- 10:26.540* :  One thing that calms her, though, are the flowers.
*10:28.400- 10:31.260* :  She points out the crocuses and the blue bells in her garden,
*10:31.840- 10:34.380* :  the flowers that survived everything to bloom again
*10:34.500- 10:36.680* :  in beautiful flashes of color.
*10:37.460- 10:40.140* :  Ludmila tells me the investigation into Valyar's death
*10:40.160- 10:41.080* :  is still open,
*10:41.680- 10:44.140* :  one of hundreds of war crimes cases in Buccia.
*10:46.420- 10:48.300* :  So I asked her how important it was to her
*10:48.680- 10:50.080* :  to find her husband's killer.
*10:53.200- 10:54.880* :  Russia will never hand them over.
*10:55.560- 10:58.060* :  It's very unlikely someone will be punished
*10:58.060- 10:59.640* :  for this in my lifetime,
*10:59.900- 11:02.800* :  but it's important, of course it is.
*11:03.260- 11:06.000* :  It would be even better for me to be able to grab
*11:06.000- 11:08.020* :  that scumbag by the throat myself.
*11:12.400- 11:14.280* :  Costum, there are children out playing
*11:14.280- 11:15.820* :  in the yard of a block of flats.
*11:16.700- 11:20.040* :  Most people who lived in Buccia before the war have returned now
*11:20.040- 11:23.580* :  and life on this sunny day looks peaceful again.
*11:27.600- 11:29.620* :  But Natalia's suffering isn't over.
*11:30.240- 11:32.820* :  When we first met, she told me how her husband Bogdan
*11:32.820- 11:36.140* :  had been detained by Russian soldiers and disappeared.
*11:36.980- 11:40.460* :  Now she tells me she's found him being held prisoner in Russia,
*11:41.120- 11:42.180* :  even though he's a civilian.
*11:42.840- 11:45.060* :  Ukrainian soldiers who were held in the same place
*11:45.060- 11:48.400* :  but have been exchanged have described conditions there.
*11:52.640- 11:53.460* :  It was really tough.
*11:54.400- 11:56.620* :  They didn't feed them and they beat them badly.
*11:57.100- 11:59.320* :  They were tortured with electric shock,
*11:59.900- 12:01.240* :  with patterns, with pipes.
*12:03.400- 12:06.100* :  Natalia is actually ethnically Russian herself,
*12:06.900- 12:08.880* :  born here, but with parents from the country
*12:08.880- 12:11.940* :  that invaded Ukraine and is now detaining her husband
*12:11.940- 12:14.020* :  illegally and abusing him.
*12:15.420- 12:17.760* :  And although things seem calm in Buccia right now,
*12:18.060- 12:18.980* :  Natalia's worried.
*12:21.860- 12:24.400* :  You see what's happening, what Putin is up to,
*12:24.840- 12:27.780* :  saying Ukraine is to blame for the Moscow terrorist attack.
*12:28.400- 12:30.180* :  Then they send ballistic missiles here.
*12:30.180- 12:32.680* :  I think he wants to declare full out war.
*12:33.320- 12:35.320* :  Sarah Rainsford reporting from Buccia.
*12:35.880- 12:38.020* :  The airline called it a mechanical issue,
*12:38.240- 12:40.860* :  rather mild language to describe how a piece
*12:40.860- 12:43.780* :  of one of its planes fell off at the start of the flight
*12:44.220- 12:46.200* :  and not just any piece, but part of the casing
*12:46.200- 12:47.360* :  which surrounds the engine.
*12:48.000- 12:50.540* :  What's more, it was a Boeing 787-800
*12:50.540- 12:52.600* :  traveling from Denver in the United States,
*12:53.200- 12:54.620* :  and as Will Verna now explains,
*12:54.760- 12:56.740* :  it's just the latest alarming incident
*12:57.340- 12:58.320* :  involving a Boeing aircraft.
*12:58.960- 13:01.820* :  In a statement, the US Federal Aviation Authority
*13:02.220- 13:03.740* :  said the aircraft's crew reported
*13:03.740- 13:06.660* :  that a piece of the engine cowling or casing
*13:07.160- 13:09.840* :  had fallen off during takeoff and struck the wing flap.
*13:10.580- 13:13.440* :  Video posted on social media shows mangled sheets
*13:13.440- 13:15.300* :  of metal around one of the engines,
*13:15.300- 13:17.880* :  flapping in the wind before breaking off.
*13:18.500- 13:20.020* :  In a statement sent to the BBC,
*13:20.100- 13:23.500* :  Southwest Airlines said the flight landed safely
*13:24.000- 13:25.860* :  after experiencing a mechanical issue,
*13:26.180- 13:28.400* :  which was being reviewed by maintenance teams.
*13:28.960- 13:31.640* :  This is the latest in a series of bizarre incidents
*13:31.880- 13:34.100* :  involving parts falling off Boeing aircraft
*13:34.100- 13:35.360* :  in the United States.
*13:35.740- 13:38.580* :  In March, a fuselage panel was found to be missing
*13:38.580- 13:41.360* :  from a Boeing after arrival at an airport in Oregon.
*13:41.920- 13:45.140* :  Earlier that month, a tire fell off a Boeing 777
*13:45.140- 13:47.020* :  during takeoff from San Francisco.
*13:47.540- 13:51.220* :  And in January, an Alaskan Airlines 737 MAX9
*13:51.220- 13:53.020* :  suffered a mid-air emergency
*13:53.020- 13:56.340* :  after an unused cabin door blew out during the flight.
*13:56.880- 13:59.240* :  Although it is the airlines that are responsible
*13:59.240- 14:01.820* :  for maintenance and inspection of their fleets,
*14:02.120- 14:05.040* :  Boeing is nevertheless coming under increasing pressure
*14:05.420- 14:06.760* :  over the safety of its aircraft.
*14:07.380- 14:09.840* :  Here in the UK, the online marketplace eBay
*14:09.840- 14:12.360* :  has announced big changes to its selling fees
*14:12.360- 14:13.880* :  to try to help the environment.
*14:14.480- 14:16.300* :  The details from Surinjana Tawari.
*14:17.020- 14:21.380* :  This is an effort to keep pre-loved clothes out of landfill.
*14:21.380- 14:23.920* :  So it's really doing something for the environment.
*14:24.580- 14:26.860* :  Now, the online marketplace has dropped fees
*14:26.860- 14:30.320* :  for individuals to sell pre-owned clothing.
*14:30.840- 14:34.000* :  And that means it's free to sell all secondhand clothing,
*14:34.000- 14:36.880* :  including brand new items with tags
*14:36.880- 14:39.260* :  on that have never been worn.
*14:39.800- 14:42.740* :  But seller fees will still apply to trainers,
*14:43.300- 14:45.000* :  watches, handbags, and jewelry.
*14:45.680- 14:48.040* :  And listings that are already up
*14:48.340- 14:51.560* :  will also benefit from this free selling.
*14:51.560- 14:53.720* :  The reason this is happening is, of course,
*14:54.320- 14:56.880* :  to improve the sustainability of fashion
*14:56.880- 14:59.980* :  and to prevent some of the negative impacts
*14:59.980- 15:01.780* :  of things like fast fashion.
*15:01.980- 15:03.140* :  There's a company called Vintage,
*15:03.140- 15:06.680* :  which has become extremely popular in the UK.
*15:07.200- 15:10.040* :  And this is probably why eBay is doing this
*15:10.040- 15:13.720* :  because Vintage allows you to sell your secondhand,
*15:13.760- 15:15.760* :  not just clothes, but goods.
*15:16.320- 15:19.220* :  And people have really jumped on the bandwagon.
*15:19.260- 15:22.460* :  So eBay probably wants a slice of that pie
*15:22.460- 15:24.800* :  since it was the original marketplace
*15:24.800- 15:27.040* :  where you could sell secondhand goods.
*15:27.760- 15:29.240* :  Surinjana Tawari reporting.
*15:31.860- 15:32.560* :  And still to come.
*15:34.680- 15:34.700* :  MUSIC
*15:42.760- 15:44.960* :  Celebrations in London and Paris
*15:44.960- 15:48.420* :  to mark the 120th anniversary of the Entente Cordial.
*15:57.020- 15:59.100* :  Honey, why are you packing a suit
*15:59.340- 16:01.180* :  with swim trunks and sunscreen?
*16:01.400- 16:02.980* :  Because I can't wear the same suit
*16:02.980- 16:06.440* :  for fine dining and kayaking, total faux pas.
*16:06.680- 16:08.760* :  Then I need something casual for the roller coasters.
*16:09.180- 16:11.760* :  Oh, and the music festival, meetings water side.
*16:12.240- 16:12.520* :  Really?
*16:12.940- 16:14.520* :  Looks like your work trip to Tampa Bay
*16:14.520- 16:17.080* :  just turned into a couples trip through the weekend.
*16:17.360- 16:18.080* :  I'll start packing.
*16:18.620- 16:20.020* :  Where it meets play in Tampa Bay,
*16:20.140- 16:22.080* :  where business and leisure blend perfectly.
*16:22.620- 16:24.760* :  Discover modern hotels and easy vibes
*16:24.760- 16:26.700* :  at visittamphabay.com.
*16:27.200- 16:28.760* :  The global jigsaw is the podcast
*16:28.760- 16:31.320* :  looking at the world through the lens of its media.
*16:31.320- 16:34.260* :  State media now, which topics they can and can't discuss.
*16:34.640- 16:36.380* :  We fill gaps and connect dots
*16:36.380- 16:38.960* :  to better understand what's happening in the world.
*16:39.180- 16:40.860* :  It's important to remember the context.
*16:41.220- 16:44.540* :  An entangled narrative's aimed at influencing your views.
*16:44.980- 16:45.980* :  Tightly controlled.
*16:45.980- 16:48.640* :  It's not so healthy to be a journalist there.
*16:49.160- 16:51.560* :  The global jigsaw from the BBC World Service.
*16:52.100- 16:54.460* :  Listen now by searching for the explanation,
*16:54.520- 16:56.560* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:03.040- 17:06.020* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is coming under pressure
*17:06.020- 17:07.480* :  from within his own government,
*17:07.480- 17:11.240* :  not to abandon plans for an assault on Raffa in southern Gaza.
*17:11.760- 17:14.000* :  Israel's right-wing national security minister,
*17:14.000- 17:16.980* :  Itamar Ben Gavir, has warned Mr Netanyahu
*17:16.980- 17:19.640* :  that he'll withdraw support for his governing coalition
*17:19.720- 17:21.300* :  unless the offensive goes ahead.
*17:21.860- 17:23.920* :  This comes as both Israel and Hamas
*17:23.920- 17:26.320* :  have played down reports of progress at talks
*17:26.320- 17:28.220* :  aimed at finding a truce in Gaza.
*17:28.660- 17:31.460* :  Michelle Hasein asked our international editor, Jeremy Bowen,
*17:31.460- 17:32.320* :  for his assessment.
*17:32.940- 17:34.320* :  There are these ceasefire talks
*17:34.860- 17:37.820* :  and prisoner exchange talks going on in Cairo,
*17:37.820- 17:40.160* :  presided over by the head of the CIA,
*17:40.740- 17:41.960* :  the head of Egyptian intelligence,
*17:41.960- 17:44.080* :  and the cutlery Prime Minister.
*17:44.480- 17:47.140* :  The Americans, I think, are trying to push very hard for a deal.
*17:47.600- 17:49.440* :  There are various leaks and rumors coming out.
*17:49.500- 17:51.000* :  But you know, it may be,
*17:51.000- 17:54.680* :  and this theory is knocking around in this really media this morning,
*17:55.220- 17:57.060* :  that pulling back from southern Gaza
*17:57.740- 18:00.480* :  may be a way, if you like, a stop towards,
*18:00.480- 18:03.100* :  or a little step towards the Hamas position
*18:03.540- 18:05.640* :  of them pulling out of Gaza completely
*18:05.780- 18:08.960* :  and therefore trying to help those negotiations.
*18:09.800- 18:12.240* :  And these talks in Cairo, which you mentioned,
*18:12.300- 18:14.680* :  there have been versions of this which have happened before.
*18:15.220- 18:16.840* :  What can you tell us about how they work?
*18:16.840- 18:20.380* :  Do Israelis and Hamas end up in the same room together
*18:20.440- 18:23.500* :  and do you think there is any kind of different move
*18:23.560- 18:25.640* :  to get towards the deal today
*18:25.640- 18:27.480* :  than there has been in recent weeks?
*18:28.040- 18:30.100* :  They absolutely do not go in the same room.
*18:30.100- 18:32.700* :  And the Americans don't go in the same room either as them.
*18:32.740- 18:34.320* :  So there are representatives there
*18:34.320- 18:37.200* :  of the political leadership of Hamas
*18:37.200- 18:40.460* :  and the casseries basically talk to them and the Egyptians.
*18:41.080- 18:43.060* :  And then they relay that back to the Americans.
*18:43.140- 18:45.560* :  They relay things to the Israelis.
*18:45.560- 18:47.100* :  So it's quite a cumbersome process.
*18:47.100- 18:49.840* :  And then the Hamas people then have to go away
*18:50.280- 18:52.160* :  and get a message, I don't know how they do it.
*18:52.400- 18:54.980* :  To Yahis and Wah, who's their leader, presumably,
*18:54.980- 18:57.380* :  in a tunnel somewhere under Gaza
*18:57.380- 19:00.460* :  with a human shield of Israeli hostages around them
*19:00.460- 19:01.800* :  as well as his own bodyguards.
*19:02.200- 19:04.600* :  And so it's a slow, slow process.
*19:04.740- 19:08.320* :  And there have been loads of leaks and rumors over the months
*19:08.360- 19:11.240* :  when they have these meetings about whether it's going well
*19:11.240- 19:12.460* :  or whether it's going badly.
*19:13.000- 19:15.440* :  So I would treat all of them with massive caution
*19:16.000- 19:19.660* :  because I think it's a huge task for those people involved
*19:19.720- 19:22.400* :  in it for the head of the CIA, William Burns particularly,
*19:22.420- 19:25.180* :  to try and bring two sides together to make a deal
*19:25.180- 19:26.940* :  who really are a wrong way apart.
*19:27.300- 19:30.340* :  There is a deal that can be made if Israel is prepared
*19:30.340- 19:33.540* :  to pay the price in terms of releasing Palestinian prisoners
*19:33.900- 19:34.940* :  to swap for hostages.
*19:35.500- 19:40.820* :  And if Hamas is prepared not to insist on Israel leaving Gaza
*19:41.320- 19:42.080* :  in its entirety.
*19:42.740- 19:44.600* :  Our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
*19:45.260- 19:48.380* :  Rescue workers in Mozambique are searching for survivors
*19:48.380- 19:50.560* :  from a boat that sank off the northern coast
*19:50.560- 19:52.340* :  with dozens of people on board.
*19:52.920- 19:54.520* :  Some passengers have been found alive
*19:54.520- 19:56.480* :  but almost 100 are known to have drowned.
*19:57.100- 19:59.660* :  The authorities in Nampoula province say most were trying
*19:59.660- 20:03.120* :  to reach an island, following a panic caused by disinformation
*20:03.180- 20:04.400* :  about a cholera outbreak.
*20:04.900- 20:07.200* :  More from our Africa correspondent, Jenny Hill.
*20:07.620- 20:11.400* :  Officials say that 130 or so people were crammed
*20:11.400- 20:14.620* :  onto what they've described as a converted fishing boat,
*20:14.940- 20:16.700* :  which they say was overcrowded
*20:17.100- 20:20.100* :  and unsuitable for the transport of passengers.
*20:20.100- 20:22.760* :  It's not yet clear what led the boat to sink.
*20:23.360- 20:25.800* :  Nor do we know why there were so many people on board.
*20:25.800- 20:28.980* :  One local politician has said that at least some
*20:28.980- 20:31.700* :  of those passengers are believed to have been fleeing
*20:31.700- 20:33.260* :  the mainland for this island
*20:33.900- 20:35.420* :  because they were concerned about cholera.
*20:35.540- 20:37.740* :  Now, there's been a big outbreak of the disease
*20:37.740- 20:39.740* :  and a number of southern African countries
*20:39.740- 20:40.780* :  in recent months.
*20:40.780- 20:44.080* :  This particular part of Mozambique, the Nampoula province,
*20:44.520- 20:46.040* :  has been one of the worst affected
*20:46.040- 20:49.020* :  with something like 15,000 cases of 30 deaths.
*20:49.560- 20:51.940* :  So that is one line of inquiry, if you like,
*20:51.940- 20:54.120* :  although at the moment the focus is very much on search
*20:54.120- 20:54.800* :  and rescue.
*20:55.260- 20:57.700* :  As you'd expect, people in the area have been reacting
*20:57.740- 21:00.820* :  with shock, not least because of the high number
*21:00.820- 21:04.200* :  of victims and so many children said to be among the dead.
*21:04.200- 21:07.360* :  I think, though, that this will perhaps increase some pressure
*21:07.360- 21:08.320* :  on the authorities.
*21:08.320- 21:11.780* :  Local journalists have told the BBC that there have been concerns
*21:12.020- 21:14.760* :  in recent times about boat safety,
*21:15.000- 21:17.580* :  very operators and the authorities coming under calls
*21:17.580- 21:19.680* :  to try and improve standards.
*21:20.060- 21:22.260* :  No doubt this particular tragedy will simply
*21:22.260- 21:24.320* :  serve to strengthen those demands.
*21:25.080- 21:28.180* :  Now, the report's findings are stark, independent experts
*21:28.180- 21:31.560* :  in Portugal have found that about 5,000 children
*21:31.560- 21:35.340* :  were sexually abused there by priests since the 1950s.
*21:35.780- 21:38.180* :  Today, Catholic bishops are beginning a four-day meeting
*21:38.180- 21:40.780* :  to decide whether to pay compensation to the victims.
*21:40.860- 21:43.000* :  From Lisbon, here's Alison Roberts.
*21:43.520- 21:46.100* :  The hierarchies response to the devastating report
*21:46.100- 21:49.220* :  on abuse by priests and others within the Portuguese church
*21:49.240- 21:51.240* :  has been found wanting by many observers,
*21:51.720- 21:52.860* :  including leading Catholics.
*21:52.980- 21:55.940* :  Portugal's top bishops at the time now retired,
*21:55.940- 21:58.980* :  said that offering financial compensation to victims
*21:58.980- 22:00.080* :  would be insulting.
*22:00.080- 22:02.640* :  His successor says it should be considered,
*22:02.640- 22:05.000* :  along with psychological and other support.
*22:05.500- 22:06.800* :  According to local media reports,
*22:06.800- 22:09.000* :  the leadership remains split on the issue,
*22:09.300- 22:11.280* :  but a group of experts set up by the church
*22:11.280- 22:13.940* :  in the wake of the report to receive complaints of abuse
*22:14.300- 22:16.820* :  has reportedly already received a number of requests
*22:16.820- 22:17.920* :  for compensation.
*22:18.000- 22:21.840* :  It is already passed on details of 50 suspected abuse cases
*22:21.840- 22:24.780* :  to the church and 18 to prosecutors and police.
*22:25.480- 22:27.540* :  For the first time in 120 years,
*22:27.540- 22:30.160* :  British and French soldiers have swapped roles
*22:30.160- 22:33.320* :  to mark the anniversary of the signing of the ontant cordial,
*22:33.320- 22:36.100* :  the treaty of friendship between Paris and London.
*22:36.680- 22:38.900* :  French soldiers took part in the changing of the guard
*22:38.900- 22:41.600* :  blocking in Paris and let the brother of King Charles,
*22:41.600- 22:42.340* :  the Duke of Edinburgh.
*22:51.580- 22:53.800* :  And British soldiers supported their counterparts
*22:53.800- 22:55.980* :  at the Alise Palace in Paris.
*23:04.920- 23:06.240* :  I heard more from my correspondent
*23:06.240- 23:08.100* :  in the French capital, Hesco Field.
*23:08.580- 23:10.580* :  We've just seen President Macron out on the street
*23:10.580- 23:12.100* :  who's gone back in with the British ambassador
*23:12.480- 23:13.780* :  having witnessed this brief,
*23:13.980- 23:16.380* :  but still quite impressive ceremony, very colorful,
*23:16.960- 23:19.100* :  in which 16 members of the Cold Stream Guard,
*23:19.100- 23:20.480* :  that's part of the household division
*23:20.480- 23:21.700* :  that guards the royals in Britain,
*23:22.060- 23:24.480* :  came over and joined the Republican Guard,
*23:24.480- 23:26.700* :  the French Guard in a kind of parade
*23:26.700- 23:31.000* :  with the national anthems on the street outside the Alise Palace.
*23:31.360- 23:34.920* :  And then they processed into the courtyard of the Alise Palace
*23:35.340- 23:37.200* :  and the British soldiers have taken part
*23:37.200- 23:39.800* :  in the changing of the guard ceremony there.
*23:40.280- 23:42.080* :  The similar thing is happening in London,
*23:42.120- 23:45.060* :  at highly and totally symbolic gesture
*23:45.060- 23:47.080* :  on this 120th anniversary.
*23:47.080- 23:48.820* :  Now you might think the 120th anniversary
*23:48.820- 23:51.520* :  is an odd one to celebrate of the ontant cordial,
*23:51.520- 23:52.900* :  but I think that's the point in a way.
*23:53.160- 23:54.540* :  They did nothing at the 110th,
*23:54.540- 23:56.620* :  but the 120th, they're trying to make the point
*23:56.620- 23:59.960* :  that despite Brexit, despite the vagaries of diplomas
*23:59.960- 24:00.780* :  in between two countries,
*24:01.080- 24:02.620* :  the alliance is still very much alive.
*24:02.620- 24:04.980* :  And it's occasions like this, this anniversary now
*24:04.980- 24:07.740* :  and that they're using to drive this point home.
*24:07.980- 24:10.060* :  This is a bit of a university essay question here,
*24:10.060- 24:11.820* :  but what is the ontant cordial?
*24:12.020- 24:13.900* :  The ontant cordial was signed in 1904
*24:13.900- 24:15.020* :  between Britain and France,
*24:15.020- 24:17.520* :  and it brought to an end a number of disputes
*24:17.520- 24:20.060* :  linked the colonial era between two countries.
*24:20.540- 24:21.240* :  That was one side of it.
*24:21.240- 24:22.920* :  More importantly and more historically,
*24:22.920- 24:26.240* :  relevantly, what it did was usher in the last century
*24:26.240- 24:27.740* :  and more of cooperation.
*24:27.820- 24:30.180* :  So at the time, no one realised what was going to happen.
*24:30.180- 24:31.800* :  Subsequently, in practice,
*24:31.800- 24:33.940* :  what happened was that the two countries got closer and closer
*24:33.980- 24:36.000* :  together, signed by side in two world wars,
*24:36.120- 24:38.160* :  and have had a very, very close alliance ever since,
*24:38.440- 24:41.000* :  an alliance which is now represented most clearly
*24:41.000- 24:43.300* :  in the military cooperation which still goes on
*24:43.420- 24:44.480* :  between the two armed forces.
*24:44.700- 24:46.820* :  But put to the test a little bit in recent years
*24:46.820- 24:49.020* :  by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
*24:49.380- 24:52.860* :  Indeed, which is why I think this 120th anniversary celebration
*24:52.860- 24:54.360* :  is interesting.
*24:54.840- 24:56.760* :  It's kind of reinforcing the point,
*24:56.760- 25:01.120* :  maybe stretching a little to create an event here today
*25:01.120- 25:02.180* :  because both governments,
*25:02.180- 25:04.720* :  particularly against the background of Ukraine,
*25:04.720- 25:07.420* :  want to say, look, on a number of levels,
*25:07.420- 25:09.960* :  things are going smoothly between the two countries,
*25:10.320- 25:12.780* :  particularly on the military and defence side.
*25:12.780- 25:14.280* :  And at this moment in history,
*25:14.280- 25:16.540* :  it's very, very important that that cooperation
*25:16.980- 25:18.480* :  be sustained and developed.
*25:19.060- 25:20.600* :  He's got filled with me from Paris.
*25:21.300- 25:23.640* :  What was it that drove the singer Amy Winehouse
*25:23.640- 25:25.940* :  into the alcoholism and self-destruction
*25:26.180- 25:27.400* :  which eventually killed her?
*25:27.880- 25:30.060* :  Was it just living life in the headlights of fame
*25:30.060- 25:32.160* :  at a young age where the paparazzi
*25:32.160- 25:35.540* :  to blame ruthlessly exposing every step of her decline?
*25:36.200- 25:39.280* :  And how should we remember a woman regarded as a vocal maestro,
*25:39.280- 25:42.560* :  but perhaps not the best role model for other young people?
*25:43.080- 25:45.680* :  These questions and others are addressed by a new film
*25:45.680- 25:48.520* :  about Winehouse, its star, Marisa Abaler,
*25:48.520- 25:50.180* :  and director Sam Taylor Johnson,
*25:50.460- 25:52.940* :  spoke to our culture correspondent Charlotte Gallagher.
*25:53.300- 25:55.660* :  I don't let me go to the music ever,
*25:55.660- 25:58.320* :  I say it no, no, no, no.
*25:59.460- 26:02.080* :  Amy Winehouse, a music legend.
*26:02.080- 26:04.820* :  Oh, no, no, no, no.
*26:05.360- 26:09.420* :  Yeah, baby, and the rest.
*26:09.680- 26:11.920* :  We've got to make me hold a rehab.
*26:11.920- 26:14.800* :  I say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*26:15.180- 26:18.540* :  Now a new film, back to black, is telling her stories.
*26:18.540- 26:20.260* :  I don't know, no, no.
*26:20.500- 26:22.260* :  Marisa Abaler plays Amy.
*26:23.360- 26:25.240* :  I want people to hear my voice.
*26:25.240- 26:29.560* :  Amy Winehouse, no, no, no, no.
*26:29.840- 26:34.500* :  It was so excited by the idea of playing
*26:35.300- 26:38.160* :  and getting in touch with Amy the girl,
*26:38.160- 26:42.760* :  and then Amy the singer, and the woman before the icon.
*26:43.000- 26:46.820* :  Director Sam Taylor Johnson told me why she cast Marisa.
*26:47.060- 26:49.400* :  It was important mostly that I could find someone
*26:49.400- 26:51.000* :  that wasn't going to impersonate Amy.
*26:51.140- 26:52.840* :  There were many brilliant impersonators
*26:52.960- 26:54.980* :  and people that looked like her or sounded like her,
*26:54.980- 26:57.380* :  but Marisa came in as herself.
*26:57.580- 26:59.600* :  Was the only one in the audition process
*26:59.620- 27:02.780* :  who didn't try to look like her in any way,
*27:03.020- 27:04.500* :  earrings, eyeliner or anything?
*27:06.700- 27:07.700* :  From primary school.
*27:07.880- 27:09.620* :  No, no, no, no.
*27:09.640- 27:11.120* :  To sell that concerts.
*27:12.240- 27:14.680* :  Amy's mum and dad are depicted in the film,
*27:14.860- 27:17.600* :  but the family weren't involved in making it.
*27:17.740- 27:18.940* :  I went to the family, you know,
*27:18.940- 27:20.720* :  really out of respects that I was making a film
*27:20.900- 27:21.560* :  about their daughter,
*27:22.160- 27:23.920* :  and I just wanted to sort of sit with them
*27:23.920- 27:25.000* :  and hear their stories,
*27:25.560- 27:27.480* :  and then go off and make the film that I wanted to make.
*27:27.660- 27:30.240* :  So they didn't have involvement as in they could say
*27:30.240- 27:31.340* :  what I couldn't come and do.
*27:31.760- 27:32.560* :  They came to set.
*27:32.920- 27:35.100* :  I think it was incredibly important for me again
*27:35.100- 27:38.000* :  to be respectful, especially when I'm in character.
*27:38.360- 27:41.240* :  It was important to just be aware of the sensitivity
*27:41.240- 27:42.100* :  of that moment.
*27:42.100- 27:44.900* :  Me, probably a wife,
*27:45.780- 27:46.540* :  or one of your mum.
*27:47.300- 27:48.920* :  A big part of Back to Black
*27:48.920- 27:52.340* :  is Amy's troubled relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil.
*27:52.560- 27:54.400* :  I'm so, I love you.
*27:54.620- 27:56.000* :  And the impact it had on her.
*27:57.120- 27:57.800* :  Here's Sam again.
*27:58.040- 28:00.220* :  I wanted to meet Blake, but I didn't meet Blake.
*28:00.640- 28:03.160* :  I set out to make the film like I said through her perspective,
*28:03.380- 28:06.600* :  so her love of him had to be powerful,
*28:06.620- 28:08.640* :  had to feel real and we had to understand
*28:09.280- 28:10.520* :  why she fell in love with him,
*28:10.620- 28:14.960* :  and so it wasn't about making a sort of one-dimensional villain.
*28:15.160- 28:18.120* :  We had to fall in love with him to understand why she wrote
*28:18.120- 28:19.960* :  one of the greatest albums about their love.
*28:20.340- 28:22.220* :  And for me, really, the villains of the film
*28:22.220- 28:23.620* :  is addiction and paparazzi.
*28:24.040- 28:25.860* :  When you actually look back now at the headlines
*28:25.920- 28:26.880* :  that were written about her,
*28:27.040- 28:28.680* :  I mean, I was reading one that said,
*28:28.780- 28:30.340* :  oh, Amy goes to see Blake in court,
*28:30.340- 28:32.360* :  but she can't hide the state of her shocking skin.
*28:32.920- 28:35.480* :  And it's a picture of someone obviously very unwell.
*28:36.160- 28:37.760* :  Do you think now what Amy went through,
*28:37.760- 28:39.040* :  what Britney Spears went through
*28:39.040- 28:41.660* :  that maybe we've moved on a bit as a society
*28:41.660- 28:43.980* :  that people wouldn't be persecuted essentially like that?
*28:44.400- 28:46.560* :  I don't know, recent news may say different.
*28:46.900- 28:49.960* :  I felt like we maybe had evolved to this place
*28:50.120- 28:51.200* :  and that wouldn't happen now,
*28:51.220- 28:52.760* :  but it feels like it is happening.
*29:06.760- 29:08.080* :  What do you think she'd make of the film?
*29:09.140- 29:12.280* :  I think that she felt like the fact
*29:12.280- 29:15.420* :  that we've sort of gifted her music back again
*29:15.420- 29:17.920* :  in a different light having seen the film.
*29:18.320- 29:20.380* :  The fact that we've had is that people want to just go
*29:20.380- 29:21.940* :  and listen to it immediately afterwards
*29:22.440- 29:25.660* :  and be more remembered for her music than for her tragedy.
*29:26.160- 29:27.640* :  Hopefully, she felt proud of it.
*29:37.860- 29:39.000* :  Charlotte Gallagher reporting.
*29:41.720- 29:42.760* :  And that's all from us for now.
*29:42.760- 29:45.320* :  There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
*29:45.640- 29:47.000* :  If you'd like to comment on this edition
*29:47.000- 29:49.000* :  and the stories we included, drop us an email.
*29:49.000- 29:53.700* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*29:54.260- 29:56.120* :  This edition was mixed by Call and Reclaim.
*29:56.120- 29:57.700* :  The producer was Nikki Verico,
*29:57.700- 29:59.300* :  the editor is Karen Martin.
*29:59.660- 30:01.080* :  I'm Andrew Peach, thanks for listening.
*30:01.080- 30:02.780* :  And until next time, goodbye.
*30:12.520- 30:14.340* :  Do you ever feel like your brain is on overdrive?
*30:14.780- 30:15.900* :  And your mind is constantly racing?
