*01:13.620- 01:16.860* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:17.200- 01:22.260* :  I'm Rachel Wright and in the early hours of Wednesday,
*01:22.260- 01:24.780* :  the 10th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:25.300- 01:29.700* :  Arizona's Supreme Court revives a near total ban on abortion in the state,
*01:29.700- 01:32.200* :  sparking an angry response from Democrats.
*01:32.300- 01:36.720* :  From contraception to abortion to IVF,
*01:36.980- 01:39.620* :  they don't plan to stop until our rights are gone.
*01:40.460- 01:43.620* :  A large air drop into Gaza to mark the end of Ramadan.
*01:44.000- 01:46.860* :  The people of Gaza are very grateful for the efforts that we're going to,
*01:46.860- 01:50.080* :  and we'll keep delivering and keep delivering until we can't give them anymore.
*01:50.740- 01:55.500* :  And the parents of a US teenager who carried out a mass shooting at a school in Michigan
*01:55.840- 01:57.560* :  are jailed for at least 10 years.
*02:00.640- 02:04.820* :  Also in this podcast has the international community turned a blind eye
*02:04.820- 02:06.320* :  to what's happening in Sudan.
*02:06.860- 02:08.800* :  This is a hundred percent genocide.
*02:08.800- 02:11.540* :  I think some of the international communities,
*02:12.180- 02:15.300* :  they don't react or they just condemn, but there is no intervention.
*02:16.180- 02:20.420* :  And the lengths a German artist went to to get his art on public display.
*02:25.880- 02:30.820* :  Arizona has become the latest American state to outlaw nearly all abortions
*02:30.820- 02:35.720* :  by reviving a law that dates back 160 years to the time of the Civil War.
*02:36.180- 02:40.080* :  It means that only terminations that save a woman's life will be allowed.
*02:40.080- 02:43.640* :  It follows a US Supreme Court judgment two years ago,
*02:43.640- 02:48.240* :  which overturned a historic decision that had legalized abortion's nation-wide.
*02:48.240- 02:51.600* :  Now, in effect, leaving the decision to individual states.
*02:52.300- 02:54.560* :  Speaking at a news conference after the ruling,
*02:54.560- 02:57.820* :  a Democratic member of Arizona's House of Representatives,
*02:58.240- 02:59.560* :  Stephanie Style Hamilton,
*03:00.040- 03:02.580* :  hit out at Republican lawmakers in the state.
*03:03.400- 03:07.540* :  Republicans here in Arizona are complicit in this ban.
*03:07.980- 03:12.700* :  And in a nationwide attempt to ban access to the range of reproductive health care
*03:13.140- 03:16.880* :  from contraception to abortion to IVF,
*03:17.140- 03:19.840* :  they don't plan to stop until our rights are gone.
*03:20.280- 03:24.060* :  The topic is likely to be one of the most important issues in this year's
*03:24.360- 03:25.820* :  presidential election campaign.
*03:25.820- 03:30.240* :  Our reporter in Washington, Carl Nassman, told me more about the court's decision.
*03:30.860- 03:35.300* :  Well, this ruling really revives this long dormant law that, like you said,
*03:35.300- 03:39.840* :  dates back to 1864. That's the time of the American Civil War.
*03:40.180- 03:42.620* :  Arizona was not even a state yet at that point.
*03:42.620- 03:45.420* :  And this was, of course, also before women were allowed to vote.
*03:46.080- 03:49.880* :  This was a four-two decision by the Arizona State Supreme Court.
*03:49.880- 03:53.360* :  Essentially, what it says is that now that Roe v Wade,
*03:53.360- 03:55.540* :  which was the Supreme Court decision,
*03:55.540- 03:58.120* :  nationwide, which had protected the right to an abortion.
*03:58.120- 03:59.540* :  Now that that has been overturned,
*03:59.780- 04:03.600* :  there's nothing standing in the way of this old law being enforced.
*04:03.600- 04:06.540* :  Now, the law, as you said, outlaws abortion,
*04:06.540- 04:08.800* :  except in cases to save the mother's life.
*04:08.800- 04:13.360* :  It does include prison time as a punishment to anyone who performs an abortion
*04:13.360- 04:15.600* :  two to five years in prison.
*04:15.600- 04:19.820* :  The attorney general in the state is actually a Democrat.
*04:19.820- 04:25.140* :  So the next question is whether or not this law will actually be enforced.
*04:25.940- 04:29.540* :  She has vowed not to enforce any abortion bans in the state.
*04:29.680- 04:31.740* :  That, though, could also be challenged in court.
*04:31.740- 04:34.740* :  In the meantime, it's expected that abortion services in Arizona
*04:35.380- 04:38.100* :  will remain in place at least through next month
*04:38.100- 04:40.960* :  to allow for further legal challenges.
*04:41.580- 04:44.340* :  Now, of course, Arizona is a crucial swing state
*04:44.340- 04:46.300* :  in the upcoming presidential elections.
*04:46.800- 04:49.380* :  And we've heard Kamala Harris already calling for
*04:49.380- 04:51.260* :  the reinstatement of Roe v Wade.
*04:51.260- 04:52.700* :  So it's such a political issue.
*04:52.860- 04:55.440* :  How will this decision play in the campaign in Arizona?
*04:56.360- 04:57.400* :  Arizona, a battleground state.
*04:57.400- 05:00.080* :  This is one of the states in the country that could end up
*05:00.120- 05:02.640* :  deciding the November presidential race.
*05:03.120- 05:06.960* :  Democrats see abortion access as a winning issue for them.
*05:06.960- 05:09.420* :  We've seen multiple state races,
*05:09.420- 05:13.080* :  state ballot referendums in multiple states
*05:13.080- 05:14.360* :  across the last couple of years.
*05:14.360- 05:17.280* :  All of them have upheld abortion rights.
*05:17.280- 05:20.600* :  And at least five different states have voted to secure
*05:20.600- 05:24.040* :  in their state constitution access to abortion.
*05:24.100- 05:26.460* :  This is something that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden
*05:26.460- 05:27.440* :  are already jumping on.
*05:27.940- 05:30.060* :  And we're likely to see a measure on the ballot
*05:30.060- 05:33.220* :  in Arizona in November where voters could vote
*05:33.220- 05:36.420* :  to protect access in their state constitution.
*05:36.420- 05:40.900* :  If you look at surveys of Arizona, 61% of Arizona voters
*05:41.580- 05:45.540* :  do say that abortion should be legal in most or in all cases,
*05:45.540- 05:49.420* :  just 6% believe that it should be legal in all cases.
*05:49.420- 05:50.840* :  This is not something that's going away.
*05:50.840- 05:53.340* :  We will see this on the campaign trail heading towards November.
*05:54.000- 05:55.500* :  Karl Nassman in Washington.
*05:56.380- 05:58.780* :  Now it was the largest international air drop
*05:58.780- 06:01.360* :  of humanitarian aid to Gaza so far.
*06:01.740- 06:04.940* :  A coalition of nine nations using 14 aircraft
*06:04.940- 06:08.080* :  took part in the operation to mark the end of Ramadan.
*06:08.600- 06:10.920* :  Our diplomatic correspondent James Landel
*06:10.920- 06:13.920* :  was the only journalist flying with a British Royal Air Force
*06:14.300- 06:16.780* :  and he sent this report over the skies of Gaza.
*06:19.600- 06:22.280* :  We're flying at 2,000 feet above Gaza.
*06:22.280- 06:25.360* :  Beneath us is the scene of utter devastation.
*06:25.960- 06:28.720* :  In the hold at 12 pallets of humanitarian aid,
*06:29.100- 06:32.780* :  all boxed up and all ready to go to slide out the back.
*06:33.620- 06:36.460* :  This is one of the RAF's biggest transport aircraft
*06:37.100- 06:39.240* :  and it's carrying about 10 tons of aid.
*06:40.080- 06:42.260* :  And that's less than the amount one truck
*06:42.740- 06:45.140* :  can carry across the border on the ground.
*06:46.040- 06:49.780* :  So this is an expensive and inadequate way of delivering aid.
*06:50.780- 06:54.080* :  The pallets were packed and loaded as an airbase in Jordan,
*06:54.580- 06:57.140* :  14 aircraft from nine nations,
*06:57.140- 07:01.480* :  including European and Arab countries and the United States.
*07:01.480- 07:05.700* :  Squadron leader Lucy Payle is in charge of the British side of the operation
*07:05.700- 07:09.160* :  and said the cumulative impact was beginning to tell.
*07:09.540- 07:10.940* :  We've been here for three weeks now,
*07:11.260- 07:13.360* :  continually delivering and we'll keep delivering
*07:13.400- 07:14.640* :  until we can't give them anymore.
*07:14.800- 07:17.200* :  There is no organized way of distributing the aid
*07:17.200- 07:20.960* :  and people have been crushed trying to make their way to the pallets.
*07:21.540- 07:24.580* :  International charities say the air drops are an illusion
*07:24.960- 07:26.980* :  designed to show something is being done.
*07:27.720- 07:29.100* :  The aid provided, they say,
*07:29.100- 07:31.960* :  correctly, will not meet the needs on the ground.
*07:32.060- 07:34.940* :  The air crews here in Jordan accept that,
*07:34.940- 07:37.060* :  but say it's better than nothing
*07:37.060- 07:38.920* :  and it is making a difference.
*07:39.620- 07:41.960* :  Not least while there is simply not enough aid
*07:41.960- 07:44.700* :  getting through by road or sea.
*07:44.900- 07:47.020* :  James Landau reporting from Jordan.
*07:47.620- 07:51.500* :  Well, as attempts to get desperately needed assistance are ratcheted up,
*07:51.880- 07:54.400* :  the head of the main UN agency in Gaza,
*07:54.400- 07:58.020* :  Felipe Lezareini, warned Palestinians who want to return
*07:58.020- 08:00.300* :  to the devastated city of Han Unis
*08:00.580- 08:02.760* :  of the threat of unexploded munitions.
*08:03.400- 08:05.020* :  Our chief international correspondent,
*08:05.020- 08:09.440* :  Lee Stusset, asked Mr. Lezareini whether his organization had the capacity
*08:09.440- 08:11.300* :  to help thousands resettle.
*08:11.600- 08:16.500* :  We do not have enough resources to help a hundred of thousands of people
*08:16.960- 08:18.480* :  who might go back to Han Unis.
*08:18.780- 08:22.020* :  You have also a hundred of other thousands of people
*08:22.720- 08:26.440* :  might be forced to be moved if there is an offensive
*08:26.440- 08:27.600* :  taking place in Gaza.
*08:27.880- 08:32.600* :  Such an offensive would have disastrous human consequences.
*08:33.180- 08:35.540* :  But if Israel is making military preparations,
*08:35.600- 08:38.080* :  don't you have to make aid preparations?
*08:38.900- 08:40.400* :  The UN will not be caught
*08:40.400- 08:44.540* :  of any forced movement of the population.
*08:45.200- 08:47.120* :  Is there some rare good news today?
*08:47.120- 08:50.020* :  Israel says the largest number of humanitarian
*08:50.020- 08:52.920* :  trucks have crossed into the Gaza Strip
*08:53.360- 08:54.760* :  since the start of this war.
*08:55.020- 08:57.340* :  What we have seen over the last few weeks
*08:57.340- 09:01.120* :  is still an average of 150, 180 trucks
*09:01.560- 09:02.720* :  entering into Gaza,
*09:03.300- 09:06.560* :  which is far below what is really required,
*09:06.560- 09:09.500* :  what we need is to flood the Gaza Strip
*09:09.500- 09:12.160* :  with food, we need more crossing.
*09:12.800- 09:16.680* :  So if these 400 plus trucks are confirmed,
*09:16.680- 09:18.780* :  it would be an improvement,
*09:18.880- 09:20.480* :  but this still needs to be confirmed.
*09:20.660- 09:22.720* :  I hope that the main reason is
*09:23.260- 09:25.520* :  that no one wants to take the responsibility
*09:26.240- 09:29.180* :  of the impact of a man-made famine.
*09:29.600- 09:30.760* :  It can be reversed.
*09:31.140- 09:33.240* :  And I really hope that the government of Israel
*09:33.240- 09:35.020* :  also understand the severity
*09:35.580- 09:38.680* :  of the hunger situation in the Gaza Strip.
*09:38.940- 09:41.560* :  If nothing is being done now,
*09:41.980- 09:44.860* :  the impact will be irremediable.
*09:45.140- 09:47.460* :  As you know, Israel has blocked your convoys
*09:47.640- 09:49.720* :  from going in to Northern Gaza,
*09:50.020- 09:53.420* :  which is where the fear is that famine already exists.
*09:53.700- 09:57.320* :  Is there any sign that you will be able to bring that aid in?
*09:57.460- 09:59.260* :  This is a total outrage.
*09:59.600- 10:03.080* :  We are the main organization in the Gaza Strip,
*10:03.820- 10:04.700* :  including in the North.
*10:05.080- 10:07.820* :  I really hope that with the increase
*10:07.820- 10:10.780* :  the number of trucks coming into the Gaza Strip,
*10:11.020- 10:12.680* :  that this is maybe a sign
*10:12.680- 10:16.240* :  that the operational environment will improve,
*10:17.040- 10:20.440* :  would be a terrible stand in our humanity,
*10:21.120- 10:24.240* :  to see this looming under our watcher
*10:24.560- 10:27.060* :  and to see kids starting to die
*10:27.360- 10:28.780* :  with the lack of a footer,
*10:29.320- 10:33.280* :  while we were warning for months that this can be reversed.
*10:33.760- 10:36.220* :  Philippe Lazarini speaking to Lisa Set.
*10:37.220- 10:38.620* :  For the first time in the US,
*10:38.620- 10:42.080* :  the parents of a teenager who killed some of his classmates
*10:42.480- 10:44.500* :  have been jailed for their part in his crime.
*10:45.080- 10:47.240* :  Jennifer and James Crumbly were convicted
*10:47.240- 10:49.440* :  of involuntary manslaughter for failing
*10:49.440- 10:50.620* :  to prevent the shootings.
*10:51.240- 10:53.320* :  They had bought a gun for their son, Ethan,
*10:53.780- 10:56.000* :  which he used to kill four fellow students
*10:56.000- 10:59.100* :  at Oxford High School in Michigan in 2021.
*10:59.940- 11:02.780* :  Speaking in court, Jennifer Crumbly defended their actions,
*11:02.780- 11:05.420* :  saying they had just acted like normal parents.
*11:06.040- 11:06.820* :  We were good parents.
*11:07.220- 11:09.380* :  We weren't perfect, but we loved our son.
*11:09.840- 11:12.400* :  Those could be any parents up here in my shoes.
*11:13.040- 11:14.120* :  Ethan could be your child.
*11:14.680- 11:15.620* :  Could be your grandchild.
*11:15.840- 11:18.680* :  Your niece, your nephew, your brother, your sister.
*11:19.260- 11:21.700* :  The parents were also accused of dismissing signs
*11:21.700- 11:24.220* :  that Ethan's mental health was deteriorating.
*11:24.600- 11:27.500* :  They'll each spend 10 to 15 years in prison.
*11:28.060- 11:30.760* :  For more on this, I spoke to our North America correspondent,
*11:30.760- 11:31.980* :  John Sudworth.
*11:32.580- 11:35.320* :  Ethan Crumbly, who was 15 years old at the time,
*11:35.320- 11:39.760* :  was given the semi-automatic handgun as an early Christmas present.
*11:39.800- 11:42.620* :  He put it in his backpack, took it to school that day,
*11:42.800- 11:45.080* :  and then carried out the shooting
*11:45.080- 11:47.080* :  that he had been planning for some time,
*11:47.080- 11:48.980* :  killing four of his fellow students,
*11:48.980- 11:52.040* :  injuring six others, and a teacher.
*11:52.500- 11:54.380* :  He was convicted last year,
*11:54.780- 11:57.720* :  the sort of premeditated nature of those murders,
*11:58.260- 12:01.460* :  meant that the prosecutors asked for the maximum possible sentence,
*12:01.460- 12:02.260* :  and they got it.
*12:02.260- 12:06.060* :  He was tried as an adult and given life in prison without parole.
*12:06.060- 12:08.420* :  What makes this case so interesting, though,
*12:08.420- 12:11.780* :  is the fact that prosecutors have also gone after his parents,
*12:11.780- 12:15.100* :  bringing charges of involuntary manslaughter against them
*12:15.100- 12:19.940* :  because of what they alleged were their serious failings
*12:20.180- 12:23.200* :  to take the steps that they say could have easily had been taken
*12:23.600- 12:25.800* :  to stop this killing taking place.
*12:25.800- 12:28.220* :  In particular, their failure to secure the weapon
*12:28.280- 12:32.460* :  was discovered that, although the weapon was kept in a kind of gun on case,
*12:32.460- 12:35.920* :  it had been defaulted to the manufacturer's code.
*12:35.920- 12:39.460* :  It was just a 0000 on the padlock to open that case,
*12:39.800- 12:43.660* :  and also they're failing the prosecutors alleged to heed the very clear warnings,
*12:43.660- 12:48.120* :  they say, that their son was suffering from serious mental health problems.
*12:48.120- 12:53.040* :  Yes, and we've heard a little bit from Jennifer Crumbly in court today
*12:53.040- 12:56.620* :  who said she just did what any other parent would have done.
*12:57.040- 12:59.620* :  That's a position she took throughout her trial,
*12:59.620- 13:04.500* :  and some observers have suggested that her unwillingness to express remorse
*13:04.500- 13:08.960* :  may in part lie behind the very stiff sentence
*13:09.000- 13:11.440* :  that she and her husband have been handed today.
*13:11.440- 13:15.420* :  The defense were arguing that there was a dangerous precedent in all of this,
*13:15.420- 13:20.760* :  that essentially other parents could now be held accountable for the act of their children,
*13:20.760- 13:22.540* :  however predictable or not,
*13:22.540- 13:25.400* :  and that that was against greater interest of natural justice.
*13:25.720- 13:29.360* :  Gun control campaigners will be celebrating it for precisely that reason,
*13:29.360- 13:33.200* :  that they hope that this sentence will send a message that will resonate
*13:33.200- 13:38.580* :  in homes right across America where guns are kept within reach of children.
*13:39.040- 13:44.400* :  John Sudworth, investigators in Nigeria say they've recovered around $24 million
*13:44.660- 13:48.540* :  from the former government minister for poverty alleviation.
*13:49.020- 13:51.360* :  Better Adu was suspended in January.
*13:51.760- 13:53.220* :  She's denied any wrongdoing.
*13:53.220- 13:56.120* :  Here's our Africa Regional Editor, Richard Hamilton.
*13:56.800- 13:59.120* :  While corruption is common in Nigeria,
*13:59.120- 14:03.240* :  the suspension of a government minister is extremely rare.
*14:03.840- 14:10.200* :  In January, Ms. Adu was accused of diverting more than $600,000 of public money
*14:10.500- 14:12.280* :  into a personal bank account.
*14:12.880- 14:16.000* :  President Bolitannoubu, who's made tackling corruption,
*14:16.060- 14:17.720* :  one of his top priorities,
*14:18.380- 14:21.520* :  then ordered the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
*14:21.900- 14:25.100* :  to carry out a full investigation into her department.
*14:25.300- 14:31.500* :  They now say they've traced $24 million in 50 separate bank accounts,
*14:32.200- 14:34.000* :  commenting on the size of the hall,
*14:34.000- 14:39.380* :  the chair of the EFCC said this was not child's play, but a big deal.
*14:39.860- 14:40.640* :  Richard Hamilton.
*14:41.340- 14:43.320* :  Now, the adventures of Huckleberry Finn
*14:43.320- 14:47.320* :  is a famous tale of unlikely friendship in 19th century America.
*14:47.840- 14:50.860* :  The novel follows the journey of a young boy, Huck Finn,
*14:51.180- 14:53.000* :  who escapes from his abusive father
*14:53.000- 14:56.200* :  with the help of an African American slave called Jim.
*14:56.940- 14:59.580* :  But now a new book is flipping the story on its head,
*14:59.580- 15:01.680* :  telling it through Jim's eyes instead.
*15:02.200- 15:04.080* :  Our culture editor, Katie Razzle,
*15:04.080- 15:06.360* :  went to meet the author, Percival Everett.
*15:06.780- 15:09.500* :  I was playing tennis and I just hit a ball wildly out of the court
*15:10.200- 15:13.540* :  and I stopped and thought, I wonder if anyone has written Huck Finn
*15:13.540- 15:16.220* :  from Jim's point of view, it turned out no one had.
*15:16.320- 15:19.760* :  We're in the water.
*15:20.420- 15:23.420* :  Percival Everett's reworked Mark Twain's classic,
*15:23.420- 15:25.080* :  The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,
*15:25.080- 15:27.360* :  the story of a young boy on the run
*15:27.360- 15:30.260* :  with an escaped slave, Jim, who becomes his friend.
*15:30.440- 15:33.860* :  He's a character that's quite present on America's literary landscape,
*15:33.860- 15:35.580* :  but he doesn't get to speak.
*15:35.960- 15:37.860* :  In the new novel, Jim has a voice.
*15:38.380- 15:41.340* :  Everett gives the slaves the power of eloquent speech.
*15:41.940- 15:45.020* :  They dumb down their language only in the presence of white people.
*15:46.600- 15:48.740* :  Twain's novel is anti-slavery,
*15:48.840- 15:52.100* :  but liberally uses the n-word and other racial tropes.
*15:52.460- 15:55.740* :  Unlike some, Everett doesn't see it as a problematic book.
*15:56.140- 15:58.840* :  Oh, not at all, I think it's a wonderful novel
*15:59.280- 16:01.580* :  in that it's the first time that we have a character
*16:01.580- 16:04.600* :  who really represents an adolescent America,
*16:05.320- 16:09.100* :  trying to come to terms with what has become the most defining feature
*16:09.100- 16:10.740* :  of the American experience, which is race.
*16:11.000- 16:13.560* :  And it was banned, but then they called it trash,
*16:13.600- 16:14.840* :  suitable only for the slums,
*16:14.840- 16:17.020* :  and then in modern times it was banned for different reasons.
*16:17.020- 16:19.540* :  In some schools, where do you stand on banning?
*16:19.840- 16:22.140* :  The first thing that fascists regimes do
*16:22.140- 16:24.720* :  is they ban books and burn them as awful.
*16:24.980- 16:25.940* :  So you would never ban a book?
*16:26.180- 16:29.700* :  No, we learn by taking in also the things that are offensive.
*16:29.920- 16:32.540* :  And you also use the n-word in your book.
*16:32.920- 16:34.440* :  Do you think James might be banned?
*16:34.700- 16:35.300* :  The one hopes.
*16:35.980- 16:37.940* :  Why? Only because I like irritated
*16:37.940- 16:39.640* :  in those people who do not think and read.
*16:39.640- 16:41.760* :  Of course, I don't want any work banned.
*16:42.540- 16:43.300* :  Look at what they published.
*16:44.100- 16:45.580* :  Look at what they expect us to write.
*16:45.920- 16:48.600* :  The recent Oscar-winning film, American Fiction,
*16:48.820- 16:51.380* :  about a novelist fighting racial stereotyping
*16:51.380- 16:54.700* :  and publishing was based on Percival Everett's book, Erasure.
*16:55.180- 16:57.620* :  He's tackled the subject of race in many of his novels,
*16:58.000- 17:00.380* :  including his book or shortlisted, The Trees,
*17:00.660- 17:02.440* :  about lynching's past and present.
*17:02.700- 17:05.080* :  There's a part of me that is angry.
*17:05.080- 17:09.040* :  There's also an acceptance of the nature of human beings.
*17:09.700- 17:12.460* :  How do you perceive the legacy of slavery in America?
*17:12.980- 17:16.420* :  There's a faction in the states that would have us ignore
*17:16.420- 17:18.060* :  the fact that slavery ever existed.
*17:18.560- 17:21.400* :  And that's a way of ignoring how slavery has impacted
*17:21.840- 17:23.820* :  the lives of people to this day.
*17:24.680- 17:27.580* :  My great grandmother, at one point, was a slave.
*17:27.580- 17:29.980* :  That's how close it is to us in time.
*17:30.380- 17:32.200* :  And yet, has never fully been addressed.
*17:34.380- 17:37.160* :  Everett's fortunate not to need financial aid himself,
*17:37.160- 17:39.480* :  but, of course, is still looking for success
*17:39.480- 17:40.440* :  from his new novel.
*17:40.760- 17:45.080* :  If I saw, let's be really optimistic, 70,000 books,
*17:45.080- 17:46.840* :  everyone will be thrilled enough.
*17:47.160- 17:48.180* :  It's a much smaller audience.
*17:48.600- 17:51.800* :  But I don't think any of us would make any of these things.
*17:51.800- 17:53.720* :  If we didn't, in some part of us,
*17:53.780- 17:55.840* :  think that we could affect the world.
*17:56.560- 17:59.140* :  However, small that effect might be.
*17:59.420- 18:02.840* :  And I take, too hard, the reception of Carinacá.
*18:03.440- 18:06.280* :  Picasso's painting about Franco's Spain.
*18:07.000- 18:07.920* :  It did affect the world.
*18:08.220- 18:09.100* :  It did change things.
*18:09.180- 18:12.780* :  And what I always remember is very few people actually saw it.
*18:12.960- 18:14.680* :  That report by Katie Razel.
*18:17.840- 18:19.980* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast,
*18:20.520- 18:22.420* :  Indigenous and Pacific Island leaders
*18:22.420- 18:24.820* :  give Wales legal personhood.
*18:25.120- 18:27.460* :  The goal here is to not only be legal persons
*18:27.580- 18:28.520* :  but in here at the right.
*18:28.880- 18:30.720* :  Part of that includes the freedom of movement,
*18:30.900- 18:33.240* :  the way healthy environment, healthy oceans,
*18:33.400- 18:35.240* :  the restoration of their populations.
*18:44.260- 18:47.940* :  Jacob Zuma has been a prominent figure in South African politics
*18:48.480- 18:50.300* :  since the dark days of apartheid.
*18:50.740- 18:53.500* :  More recently, he's been one of the country's most controversial
*18:53.500- 18:54.160* :  characters.
*18:54.700- 18:57.380* :  On Tuesday, Mr. Zuma wrote the latest page
*18:57.380- 19:00.320* :  in his own long-running political psycho-drama
*19:00.680- 19:02.580* :  as South Africa's electoral court
*19:02.580- 19:04.980* :  ruled that the former president could stand
*19:04.980- 19:08.680* :  in May's general election, overturning a previous ban.
*19:09.200- 19:10.680* :  For more on the background to the ruling
*19:10.680- 19:12.420* :  and what it might mean for the election,
*19:12.420- 19:15.680* :  I spoke to our correspondent in Johannesburg, Jenny Hill.
*19:15.960- 19:16.860* :  Jacob Zuma.
*19:17.120- 19:20.160* :  A week or so back was barred from standing
*19:20.160- 19:23.420* :  in the forthcoming general election in the countries
*19:23.420- 19:24.680* :  at the end of May.
*19:24.720- 19:28.280* :  Now, he had appealed that decision by electoral officials.
*19:28.280- 19:30.540* :  They had argued that he couldn't stand
*19:30.580- 19:33.020* :  because under the constitution no one who's
*19:33.020- 19:36.500* :  been convicted and sentenced to more than 12 months
*19:36.500- 19:38.860* :  in prison can hold public office.
*19:39.180- 19:43.720* :  Mr. Zuma was sentenced in 2021 to 15 months in prison,
*19:43.780- 19:45.700* :  though he only served three months
*19:45.720- 19:49.420* :  because of health reasons after being convicted
*19:49.420- 19:51.960* :  of a contemptive court when he refused
*19:51.960- 19:54.800* :  to cooperate with an investigation into corruption.
*19:55.320- 19:57.700* :  But the electoral court in South Africa
*19:57.700- 19:59.740* :  has ruled that he can stand.
*19:59.740- 20:03.300* :  And that's hugely significant because Mr. Zuma
*20:03.600- 20:06.320* :  is no longer a member of the African National Congress,
*20:06.320- 20:09.440* :  the governing party that's ruled here for 30 years,
*20:10.040- 20:14.200* :  and he's gone in instead with a newly formed opposition
*20:14.280- 20:15.040* :  party.
*20:15.440- 20:17.400* :  And today's ruling means that he'll actually be there
*20:17.400- 20:20.020* :  leading candidate when it comes to the election itself.
*20:20.380- 20:22.040* :  How much support does he still have?
*20:22.060- 20:25.180* :  Because when he was president, he had huge grassroots level
*20:25.180- 20:27.480* :  support from all around the country.
*20:27.820- 20:29.960* :  Yeah, I mean, this is what's going to be really interesting.
*20:30.000- 20:32.960* :  People might recall actually that at the time of his jailing,
*20:33.300- 20:36.560* :  there were really nasty violent riots.
*20:36.820- 20:38.080* :  So he does have support.
*20:38.180- 20:40.680* :  And I think despite his conviction and sentencing,
*20:40.680- 20:43.840* :  there are people who are still in a very fond of him,
*20:44.120- 20:48.160* :  particularly in his political heartland of Quazulu Natal,
*20:48.160- 20:49.960* :  as they refer to it here.
*20:50.360- 20:52.980* :  And that's what political analysts are really looking at,
*20:53.000- 20:55.240* :  because first of all, there's the big question,
*20:55.300- 20:57.840* :  how much is this going to affect his old parties
*20:58.000- 20:59.060* :  standing in the election?
*20:59.100- 21:01.740* :  They're already on course for a pretty bruising election
*21:01.800- 21:04.760* :  with some pollsters reckoning they might actually lose
*21:04.760- 21:06.300* :  their majority for the first time.
*21:06.820- 21:09.360* :  Now, with him as their leading candidate,
*21:09.560- 21:13.520* :  will this new party, MK, do well enough to help
*21:13.520- 21:15.300* :  the ANC lose its majority?
*21:15.760- 21:17.960* :  And analysts say if you look at particularly the region
*21:17.960- 21:22.100* :  of KZN, it could get around 25% of the vote.
*21:22.460- 21:24.000* :  You might even end up with a situation
*21:24.000- 21:27.000* :  where this party is acting in effect as a kingmaker.
*21:27.700- 21:29.260* :  Jenny Hill in Johannesburg.
*21:30.060- 21:33.980* :  It's almost a year since Sudan was plunged into a civil war,
*21:33.980- 21:37.040* :  which has displaced more than eight and a half million people
*21:37.460- 21:39.280* :  and left the country on the brink of famine.
*21:39.820- 21:41.580* :  According to United Nations experts,
*21:42.020- 21:44.520* :  15,000 people were killed in just one town
*21:44.520- 21:47.960* :  in the region of Darfur, where the violence of 20 years ago
*21:47.960- 21:51.840* :  which the US called a genocide appears to be repeating itself.
*21:52.460- 21:54.600* :  The fighting is between the Sudanese army
*21:54.600- 21:57.500* :  and the rebel rapid support forces, the RSF.
*21:57.940- 22:00.440* :  As Mercy Juma reports, targeted killings
*22:00.500- 22:01.760* :  have been commonplace.
*22:02.240- 22:04.700* :  Some of what you're about to hear is distressing.
*22:06.300- 22:07.920* :  Ahmed Tansh Shed.
*22:09.020- 22:11.140* :  His eyes fixed on the font screen.
*22:11.660- 22:13.760* :  He is watching a video showing five
*22:13.900- 22:16.760* :  and armed civilians lined up on a straight in Sudan,
*22:17.240- 22:19.920* :  being threatened by men dressed in the typical style
*22:20.600- 22:23.680* :  of the rapid support forces and its allied Arab militias.
*22:24.140- 22:29.200* :  Suddenly, they are shot at point-blank range.
*22:29.680- 22:34.320* :  I know, some people told me that they saw a video that I was in,
*22:34.640- 22:37.560* :  but I didn't take much notice because I don't have a smartphone.
*22:37.780- 22:40.360* :  The 30-year-old, his name we have changed,
*22:40.360- 22:42.940* :  is one of the people in the video who was shot.
*22:43.820- 22:47.980* :  This was the first time he had seen the footage of what happened.
*22:49.300- 22:51.760* :  Two of the men, Ahmatska's in Amir,
*22:52.180- 22:54.520* :  and his friend Abbas died instantly.
*22:55.380- 22:58.140* :  Incredibly, Ahmat and the two other men survived.
*22:58.900- 23:01.620* :  Like thousands of others in Sudan's Darfur region,
*23:01.620- 23:04.500* :  he says he was attacked by the rapid support forces
*23:04.680- 23:06.160* :  and its allied Arab militias.
*23:06.580- 23:10.500* :  Just because he is a part of Sudan's black African community.
*23:12.340- 23:14.700* :  After they opened fire, and we were lying on the ground,
*23:15.520- 23:17.800* :  I remember praying and thinking that it was the end.
*23:18.700- 23:21.060* :  Then someone told us anyone who was just injured
*23:21.120- 23:22.520* :  should get up and run away.
*23:23.700- 23:24.920* :  After surviving the attack,
*23:25.160- 23:27.740* :  he became one of the more than 600,000 people
*23:27.740- 23:29.840* :  who have fled Sudan to neighboring Chad.
*23:30.940- 23:34.520* :  Here, almost all of them have seen or experienced violence.
*23:35.060- 23:38.580* :  Many people told us they were abducted from their homes at a gunpoint.
*23:39.240- 23:43.220* :  We meet 23-year-old Mustafa at a refugee camp in Adre Chad.
*23:43.900- 23:46.600* :  He walks with a crotch and says he was rounded up
*23:46.620- 23:48.220* :  from his home by militia members.
*23:48.740- 23:50.220* :  He was put in a large group of men.
*23:50.640- 23:52.460* :  Some of them were shot straight away,
*23:52.860- 23:55.380* :  but he was fast taken to help loot properties
*23:55.380- 23:58.400* :  and then forced to run to an airport outside of town.
*24:00.660- 24:04.040* :  They told us to lie down and then they made us crawl across the runway.
*24:04.380- 24:07.220* :  My arms and legs were injured, then I was shot.
*24:07.480- 24:09.500* :  His account matches other reports.
*24:11.420- 24:14.680* :  The BBC has verified a video of a different group of men
*24:14.680- 24:17.960* :  being forced at gunpoint to make the same journey to the airport.
*24:19.080- 24:23.520* :  We shot it to him and he says he recognizes five of his friends.
*24:24.480- 24:25.520* :  He managed to escape,
*24:25.520- 24:28.880* :  but does not know what happened to those he left behind.
*24:29.580- 24:31.880* :  What is so disturbing for many of the victims
*24:31.880- 24:34.720* :  and their relatives is the apparent in action
*24:34.720- 24:38.100* :  that they feel is coming from the international community.
*24:38.700- 24:42.260* :  Hatim Abdallah, a senior member of the Black Masjid community,
*24:42.260- 24:45.980* :  fled the door for because he was targeted by the RSF
*24:46.300- 24:48.320* :  who came to his house looking for him.
*24:48.900- 24:50.800* :  This is a hundred percent genocide.
*24:50.820- 24:55.540* :  If I have the time to use, I will use, I think, some of the international communities.
*24:56.120- 24:58.580* :  They are silent. They don't react or they just condemn.
*24:59.340- 25:00.400* :  But there is no intervention.
*25:01.200- 25:04.980* :  Reports of alleged crimes committed by both the RSF
*25:05.280- 25:07.560* :  and the Sudanese military continue to grow.
*25:08.220- 25:11.760* :  There is also no end in sight to the brutal war.
*25:12.540- 25:14.640* :  Mercy Jumeir reporting from Chad.
*25:15.720- 25:18.400* :  The British theoretical physicist Peter Higgs,
*25:18.400- 25:22.060* :  who lent his name to a new particle, the Higgs Boson, has died.
*25:22.620- 25:23.400* :  He was 94.
*25:24.020- 25:25.660* :  Peter Higgs changed the world of physics
*25:25.660- 25:27.880* :  with what was renamed the God particle
*25:28.280- 25:31.820* :  and together with his colleague Francois Englert won the Nobel Prize.
*25:32.460- 25:36.100* :  Our science reporter Rebecca Morale looks back at Peter Higgs's life.
*25:36.640- 25:39.120* :  Peter Higgs said there was no eureka moments
*25:39.120- 25:42.960* :  when he came up with his idea that would change the face of fundamental physics.
*25:43.780- 25:46.980* :  In 1964, the Edinburgh University scientist
*25:46.980- 25:49.740* :  proposed a new theory that addressed the question
*25:50.060- 25:53.360* :  of whether most basic building blocks of the universe have mass.
*25:54.160- 25:56.900* :  He argued that a new type of particle must exist
*25:57.420- 25:59.460* :  that would make all other particles heavy.
*25:59.960- 26:02.600* :  At first, his work felt to make much of an impact.
*26:02.620- 26:06.860* :  An early scientific paper was rejected by the journal Physics Letters.
*26:07.360- 26:10.680* :  But by the 1970s, the idea began to take hold.
*26:11.180- 26:13.660* :  And despite the fact that two other research groups
*26:13.960- 26:16.700* :  had also worked independently on the same theory,
*26:17.040- 26:19.900* :  this particle became known as the Higgs Boson.
*26:20.360- 26:22.220* :  The hunt for the Higgs was on.
*26:22.700- 26:24.460* :  But it wasn't until decades later
*26:24.460- 26:26.880* :  when the professor was in his 80s and retired
*26:26.880- 26:28.600* :  that it was finally found.
*26:29.420- 26:30.180* :  We have a discovery.
*26:31.160- 26:32.700* :  We should state that we have a discovery.
*26:32.980- 26:37.120* :  We have observed a new particle consistent with a Higgs Boson.
*26:37.680- 26:38.700* :  APPLAUSE
*26:41.340- 26:45.360* :  In July 2012, scientists at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva
*26:45.840- 26:47.600* :  announced that they discovered the particle.
*26:48.340- 26:51.300* :  It took Peter Higgs, described by those who knew him
*26:51.300- 26:53.620* :  as Loki and modest by surprise.
*26:54.220- 26:56.500* :  Well, I would like to add my congratulations
*26:56.700- 26:59.240* :  to everybody involved in this tremendous achievement.
*26:59.880- 27:02.600* :  For me, it's really an incredible thing
*27:02.600- 27:04.440* :  that it happened in my lifetime.
*27:05.380- 27:05.800* :  It's taken.
*27:06.420- 27:06.920* :  APPLAUSE
*27:09.720- 27:12.440* :  The music the discovery was covered around the world
*27:12.980- 27:15.140* :  and transformed Peter Higgs from someone
*27:15.140- 27:18.100* :  known mostly to scientists into a household name.
*27:18.700- 27:21.280* :  Rebecca Morrell, with that report on Peter Higgs,
*27:21.280- 27:23.460* :  who's died at the age of 94.
*27:24.540- 27:26.300* :  Indigenous leaders in New Zealand
*27:26.440- 27:27.940* :  and a group of Pacific islands
*27:27.960- 27:30.560* :  have agreed a groundbreaking charter of rights
*27:30.560- 27:31.920* :  for Wales and dolphins.
*27:32.540- 27:34.420* :  It would recognize them as persons
*27:34.640- 27:36.140* :  and grant them a range of rights,
*27:36.140- 27:38.160* :  including the right to cultural expression.
*27:38.720- 27:42.000* :  The document was championed by the Hinamona Halo Initiative,
*27:42.000- 27:43.560* :  which is based in New Zealand.
*27:44.200- 27:47.240* :  Edward Sturton spoke to its leader, Mary Takoko,
*27:47.580- 27:49.860* :  and to Josh Milburn, who specialises
*27:49.860- 27:51.700* :  in the philosophy of animal rights
*27:51.700- 27:54.320* :  at the University of Loughborough here in England.
*27:54.340- 27:56.960* :  He started by asking Mary Takoko
*27:56.960- 27:59.440* :  what the new declaration aims to achieve.
*28:00.040- 28:02.260* :  We believe it marks a very radical shift
*28:02.540- 28:06.100* :  in the way that we view our ancestors, the whale,
*28:06.100- 28:07.380* :  which we call Duhora,
*28:08.120- 28:11.100* :  a goal he has to not only recognise their inherent mutna,
*28:11.220- 28:13.220* :  which is their spiritual essence,
*28:13.880- 28:16.460* :  but actually to be legal persons with inherent rights.
*28:16.800- 28:18.680* :  How do that includes the freedom of movement,
*28:18.800- 28:21.200* :  the way healthy environment, healthy oceans,
*28:21.940- 28:24.000* :  and indeed the restoration of their populations?
*28:24.740- 28:27.840* :  All of nature should have a right to express itself
*28:27.840- 28:32.240* :  and to ensure that it can survive, just like us as humans.
*28:32.480- 28:33.660* :  Josh Milburn, what do you make of this?
*28:34.120- 28:37.100* :  One of the things I find very interesting about this development
*28:37.140- 28:41.000* :  is the way that it talks about Wales as individuals.
*28:41.640- 28:43.900* :  It's important to recognise that there's a difference
*28:43.900- 28:47.040* :  between certain kinds of environmentalist ideas
*28:47.040- 28:49.160* :  around, say, the rights of nature
*28:49.700- 28:52.340* :  and certain kinds of animal rights type ideas
*28:52.680- 28:54.760* :  about protecting animals as individuals.
*28:55.360- 28:58.380* :  And I think this declaration speaks to both of those ideas.
*28:58.760- 29:00.400* :  So I think this is the kind of move
*29:00.540- 29:01.900* :  that could really get a lot of support
*29:01.900- 29:04.140* :  from a range of different people.
*29:04.320- 29:06.060* :  What difference do you think it would make?
*29:06.420- 29:09.700* :  Think of something like here in the UK, Grisquirls.
*29:09.920- 29:12.220* :  If we think of Grisquirls as being the kinds of beings
*29:12.220- 29:13.800* :  who could have rights individually,
*29:13.840- 29:16.960* :  we might say, well, we shouldn't be exterminating Grisquirls
*29:16.960- 29:19.520* :  even if that's something that might have certain kinds
*29:19.520- 29:21.580* :  of environmental or ecosystem benefit.
*29:21.800- 29:23.320* :  It also, I suppose, Mary Takoko,
*29:23.320- 29:26.200* :  raises the question of how far you can take this.
*29:26.660- 29:30.040* :  Is there any reason not to extend rights to other species?
*29:30.500- 29:32.920* :  Of course, but for us, what's important here,
*29:33.260- 29:34.440* :  among other things, in particular,
*29:34.440- 29:37.280* :  the protection of the Wales is that it's pollination leaders
*29:37.520- 29:38.800* :  and the traditional adicute.
*29:38.800- 29:41.760* :  Leaders whose voices haven't been heard before
*29:42.100- 29:43.860* :  within the conservation movement,
*29:44.620- 29:48.240* :  we want to create a win-win for governments who do,
*29:48.880- 29:52.100* :  decide to endorse and adopt personhood legislation.
*29:52.840- 29:55.360* :  We want wins also for industry.
*29:56.060- 29:58.520* :  And of course, we want wins for indigenous people
*29:58.520- 30:00.040* :  and conservationists.
*30:00.620- 30:04.120* :  My people have been protecting the oceans for thousands of years.
*30:04.480- 30:08.040* :  We did not take out all of the Wales from our oceans.
*30:08.680- 30:11.480* :  We had European industrial whalers come and do that.
*30:11.940- 30:14.080* :  So for us and restoring those populations,
*30:14.180- 30:17.700* :  it's also about restoring hope for our culture.
*30:17.960- 30:20.840* :  And also, it's an expression of our cultural survival
*30:20.840- 30:22.260* :  as oceanic people.
*30:22.580- 30:24.320* :  Well, you make it very clear that this is something
*30:24.320- 30:25.760* :  that comes from within your culture.
*30:25.760- 30:28.660* :  Do you think it's realistic to think of selling it
*30:28.660- 30:29.980* :  if you like to governments?
*30:30.420- 30:30.860* :  Absolutely.
*30:31.720- 30:35.860* :  We don't want us to be something that's too far a departure
*30:36.460- 30:38.440* :  from the blue economy, which we're seeing
*30:38.900- 30:39.960* :  throughout the world right now.
*30:40.460- 30:43.100* :  This is about recognising the world as an ancestor
*30:43.120- 30:47.340* :  and the perfect anchor for this emerging nature economy,
*30:47.340- 30:50.680* :  which is actually going to be worth 10 trillion by 2030.
*30:50.980- 30:53.900* :  I actually would like to see us extend this much further down.
*30:53.900- 30:56.780* :  It becomes much harder when we're thinking about animals
*30:56.780- 31:00.300* :  who we already exploit, pigs, chickens, think of cows.
*31:00.900- 31:04.300* :  It's a much harder sell to talk about giving these animals rights,
*31:04.600- 31:06.360* :  yet they're the ones who really need the rights
*31:06.360- 31:08.860* :  because they are the ones that we exploit so brutally.
*31:09.400- 31:13.320* :  Josh Limburn and Mary Takoko speaking to Edward Sturton.
*31:14.040- 31:15.260* :  Now, there are many different ways
*31:15.340- 31:16.900* :  that artists achieve success.
*31:17.280- 31:18.880* :  Some go through the traditional schools
*31:18.880- 31:21.460* :  where they're trained in painting or sculpture perhaps.
*31:22.040- 31:23.920* :  A few lucky ones might be picked up
*31:23.960- 31:26.460* :  by a rich patron who favours their work,
*31:26.920- 31:30.300* :  but an artist in Germany has taken a rather simpler approach
*31:30.300- 31:33.040* :  to seeing his work on show in a major gallery.
*31:33.600- 31:36.060* :  Our Europe Regional Editor Paul Moss told me
*31:36.060- 31:37.200* :  how he went about it.
*31:37.580- 31:40.820* :  The artist concern happened to be a member of the technical staff
*31:40.900- 31:42.660* :  at the Panacoteque de Mordana,
*31:42.660- 31:45.320* :  one of the biggest modern art galleries in Europe.
*31:45.340- 31:46.080* :  It's in Munich.
*31:46.700- 31:47.740* :  And it's very prestigious.
*31:47.740- 31:50.220* :  It has works by Picasso and Paul Clay.
*31:50.880- 31:52.680* :  This man had access to the building
*31:52.680- 31:55.860* :  and it seems he smuggled in one of his own paintings.
*31:55.860- 31:58.280* :  I one can presume he did this out of ours.
*31:58.840- 32:01.960* :  And he hung it on the wall and the gallery won't tell us
*32:01.960- 32:04.040* :  how long it was there before anyone noticed,
*32:04.040- 32:07.020* :  but there it was his work in this very prestigious gallery.
*32:07.620- 32:09.500* :  And how did the gallery react?
*32:10.240- 32:12.460* :  They seem to have had a bit of a sense of humor failure.
*32:12.460- 32:15.020* :  I have to say, they not only removed the painting,
*32:15.560- 32:17.200* :  they sacked the man concerned.
*32:17.200- 32:18.820* :  They banned him from the gallery
*32:19.120- 32:20.320* :  and they called the police
*32:20.480- 32:23.940* :  because he drilled two small holes in the wall for screw
*32:23.940- 32:25.120* :  so he could hang his paintings.
*32:25.120- 32:26.980* :  So I guess they're investigating him
*32:26.980- 32:28.420* :  for something like criminal damage.
*32:29.100- 32:30.460* :  It sounds a bit heavy-handed.
*32:30.680- 32:33.380* :  Yeah, I think the galleries are in an embarrassing situation
*32:33.380- 32:34.300* :  with something like this.
*32:34.300- 32:36.780* :  Firstly, you've got to remember modern art galleries.
*32:36.780- 32:40.540* :  They feature work by people like Picasso and Dali Manre.
*32:40.540- 32:43.400* :  These were radical provocateurs in their time.
*32:43.460- 32:45.060* :  So they don't like it when someone actually
*32:45.060- 32:48.300* :  does something genuinely provocative in the modern day.
*32:48.300- 32:51.080* :  But also, you know, a lot of people do dismiss modern art
*32:51.080- 32:52.940* :  and they say, I would child could do this.
*32:53.220- 32:54.800* :  They think the whole thing's one big,
*32:55.040- 32:56.460* :  emperors new clothes affair.
*32:56.880- 32:59.260* :  So I guess it's embarrassing if a work does sit there
*32:59.260- 33:00.640* :  and no one goes hold on a moment.
*33:01.080- 33:02.700* :  I don't know that and that's no good.
*33:02.700- 33:05.060* :  Although I suppose it's possible this guy is a genius
*33:05.060- 33:07.600* :  and his painting was just as good as a Picasso.
*33:08.200- 33:10.480* :  Are you aware that this happens a lot?
*33:10.480- 33:13.940* :  Well, I know that it actually happened in Germany earlier this year.
*33:13.940- 33:17.220* :  This was in Bond, the old capital at the Kunsthuller Gallery.
*33:17.700- 33:19.820* :  Now, the artist there, he just marched in at some point
*33:19.820- 33:21.640* :  and sellitaked his work to the wall.
*33:22.020- 33:23.520* :  It was only when the exhibition closed.
*33:23.520- 33:25.440* :  They thought, hold on, we've got one extra.
*33:25.880- 33:28.540* :  Now, that gallery had a rather more sympathetic attitude.
*33:28.540- 33:32.060* :  They posted a message on the social media platform X saying,
*33:32.060- 33:33.480* :  we thought that was very funny.
*33:33.480- 33:35.060* :  Please get in touch.
*33:35.540- 33:36.080* :  Paul Moss.
*33:39.060- 33:40.460* :  And that's all from us for now,
