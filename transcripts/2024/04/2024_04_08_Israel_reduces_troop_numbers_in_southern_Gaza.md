*01:19.140- 01:21.740* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.660- 01:27.180* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Monday, the 8th of April, these are our main
*01:27.180- 01:27.640* :  stories.
*01:27.780- 01:33.540* :  Israel says it's withdrawn ground troops from southern Gaza to prepare for future operations
*01:33.540- 01:36.240* :  including in the overcrowded town of Raffa.
*01:36.840- 01:41.800* :  The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog says the zaparicia power plant in Russian occupied
*01:41.800- 01:45.400* :  Ukraine has been hit by the worst drone attack for 18 months.
*01:46.140- 01:51.640* :  Elon Musk has reacted angrily to a ruling by a Brazilian judge that anti-democratic posts
*01:51.640- 01:54.440* :  on the social media platform X should be blocked.
*01:56.100- 02:05.420* :  Also in this podcast, after suffering armed robberies and running 385 marathons, the
*02:05.420- 02:09.880* :  length of Africa, a British runner finally ends the longest of runs.
*02:13.140- 02:14.420* :  We begin in Israel.
*02:15.280- 02:20.800* :  The country's defence minister says its forces have left southern Gaza to prepare for future
*02:21.500- 02:23.580* :  operations, including in the town of Raffa.
*02:23.760- 02:29.380* :  Following weeks of a deadly Israeli ground offensive in the city of Khan Yunus, Yorv Galant
*02:29.380- 02:33.700* :  said Hamas had now ceased to function as a military organisation there.
*02:34.280- 02:39.460* :  But a spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces, Peter Lerner, says the war is far from over.
*02:39.900- 02:44.740* :  The military campaign is continuously evolving and this is just another stage in the war
*02:44.740- 02:48.200* :  effort, as we completed our mission in the Khan Yunus area.
*02:48.640- 02:53.040* :  So then the troops rotate out and we have other troops that are operating elsewhere.
*02:53.640- 02:58.520* :  So it's important to understand it as a decline in the forces, but there are more operations
*02:58.520- 02:59.680* :  that need to be conducted.
*03:00.240- 03:04.300* :  Raffa is clearly a stronghold where there are four battalions untouched.
*03:04.880- 03:08.040* :  So we need to be able to get all of the hostages back wherever they are.
*03:08.040- 03:13.880* :  We need to dismantle Hamas' capabilities wherever they are and we will immobilise our forces
*03:14.440- 03:14.460* :  accordingly.
*03:15.000- 03:18.700* :  Thousands of people took to the streets of Jerusalem on Sunday night to demand that
*03:18.700- 03:23.280* :  Israel's government does more to secure the release of the hostages held by Hamas in
*03:23.280- 03:26.740* :  Gaza since the October 7th attacks in southern Israel.
*03:27.440- 03:32.180* :  Meanwhile the head of the Palestinian mission to the UK, who Sam Zomlot said the international
*03:32.180- 03:35.560* :  community is not doing enough to stop Israel's operations.
*03:36.320- 03:40.480* :  Nataliajo wants a perpetual aggression on Gaza.
*03:40.740- 03:45.900* :  He needs war and if it's not even in Gaza he's going to Lebanon, to Syria, he's provoking
*03:45.900- 03:46.780* :  in the West Bank.
*03:46.780- 03:52.000* :  This Prime Minister of Israel lives now, lives on aggression.
*03:52.000- 03:55.440* :  The leverage of the rest of the world has not been exercised.
*03:55.540- 04:01.460* :  Despite all the statements we have been hearing and still, Nataliajo is preparing for an
*04:01.460- 04:02.820* :  invasion of Raffa.
*04:02.980- 04:04.720* :  He has declared it many times.
*04:04.720- 04:06.000* :  You know the consequences.
*04:06.000- 04:11.820* :  The untold stories and suffering that would be caused if he does, they have already turned
*04:11.820- 04:12.720* :  Gaza unlivable.
*04:12.880- 04:13.820* :  It is unlivable.
*04:13.820- 04:19.020* :  The sheer level of destruction that has occurred in Gaza is unmatched.
*04:19.460- 04:24.280* :  I spoke to our Middle East analyst Sebastian Asher who is in Jerusalem and asked him what
*04:24.280- 04:29.460* :  is his understanding regarding the announcement by Israel that it's withdrawn its ground troops
*04:29.460- 04:34.280* :  from southern Gaza to prepare for future operations including in the town of Raffa.
*04:34.940- 04:39.580* :  I think what you were just played there from the idea of a spokesperson obviously gives
*04:39.580- 04:45.280* :  a sense of how the Israeli army is trying to portray it, not as anything that is resembling
*04:45.660- 04:51.180* :  a downward turn in the war and move perhaps towards its end, essentially a reshuffling of
*04:51.180- 04:58.440* :  troops, a chance for the troops who have obviously been under intense pressure inside Gaza
*04:59.060- 05:04.600* :  to rest and recuperate, I mean that's how the U.S. has also reacted to at the White
*05:04.600- 05:10.980* :  House National Security spokesman essentially used those words saying that he didn't believe
*05:11.760- 05:18.800* :  that it was likely a gambit to prepare for a new major operation that has been speculation
*05:19.560- 05:25.180* :  in Israel that this could be a withdrawal of troops who would then be used in another
*05:25.180- 05:31.900* :  operation, the one operation that's left in terms of territory in Gaza is Raffa, the
*05:31.900- 05:36.360* :  southernmost town where more than a million Palestinians to space Palestinians have taken
*05:36.360- 05:36.780* :  refuge.
*05:37.060- 05:41.460* :  And the Palestinian diplomat we heard there in the UK was saying the international community
*05:41.460- 05:42.460* :  is not doing enough.
*05:42.460- 05:47.980* :  I mean America has been very clear about an invasion into Raffa with more than a million
*05:47.980- 05:50.460* :  people, civilians sheltering there.
*05:51.140- 05:56.380* :  What mood is there do you think amongst Israelis and the Israeli government for that move
*05:56.380- 05:57.180* :  into Raffa now?
*05:57.360- 06:00.420* :  Well I mean I think that's a nuanced question.
*06:00.460- 06:08.560* :  The mood amongst the Israeli people such as it can be gauged is still support for the
*06:08.560- 06:14.340* :  military campaign but tempered very very strongly and we've seen that in the protests we've
*06:14.340- 06:19.160* :  been taking place in the last few weeks on Saturdays but where around a hundred thousand
*06:19.160- 06:20.340* :  people came out.
*06:20.860- 06:27.360* :  And these calls are essentially in favor of trying to save the hostages who are still
*06:27.360- 06:32.440* :  being held in Gaza and the sense that the military campaign may not be achieving that
*06:32.440- 06:34.220* :  may actually be doing the opposite.
*06:34.680- 06:40.800* :  So calls for a ceasefire are based on that not necessarily on what the Palestinians have
*06:40.800- 06:44.880* :  suffered or the international community is demanding but in the sense that these really
*06:44.880- 06:50.080* :  hostages who are still in Gaza the best solution for them is a ceasefire that would allow
*06:50.080- 06:53.120* :  them hopefully to be released in a deal with Hamas.
*06:53.620- 06:55.200* :  Sebastian Usher in Jerusalem.
*06:56.380- 07:02.940* :  Sunday marked exactly six months since the October the 7th attacks which led directly to the
*07:02.940- 07:04.320* :  conflict in the Gaza Strip.
*07:04.920- 07:09.940* :  The Hamas run health ministry in the territory says that over 33,000 Palestinians are being
*07:09.940- 07:12.760* :  killed in the Israeli military offensive which followed.
*07:13.360- 07:16.220* :  From Jerusalem our international editor Jeremy Bowen reports.
*07:17.140- 07:23.720* :  At his cabinet meeting Benjamin Netanyahu marked six months since Samas killed around 1200
*07:23.720- 07:27.080* :  Israelis, mostly civilians, on the 7th of October.
*07:27.760- 07:32.940* :  He said Israel would complete the elimination of Hamas in all Gaza.
*07:33.440- 07:40.380* :  That Mr Netanyahu insisted included Rafa in the south where 1.4 million Palestinian civilians
*07:40.380- 07:41.580* :  are sheltering.
*07:42.900- 07:51.160* :  Citizens of Israel there is no war more just than this one and we are determined to
*07:51.160- 07:56.700* :  achieve total victory to ensure that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel.
*07:58.140- 08:03.780* :  I went to Kibbutz near Oz where a quarter of the 400 Israeli residents were killed or taken
*08:03.780- 08:05.900* :  hostage on the 7th of October.
*08:06.260- 08:11.520* :  Ron Bahat who survived the attack showed me the homes of friends and neighbors who did not.
*08:12.140- 08:13.980* :  Alex Danzig was kidnapped from here.
*08:14.560- 08:16.820* :  Salman Salmanov it was abducted from here.
*08:17.280- 08:19.580* :  His body is in the Gaza Strip.
*08:19.800- 08:23.560* :  Gid on Palka they were shooting him through the door.
*08:24.200- 08:30.600* :  His wife was putting a turning kidney but he was bleeding to death on him.
*08:30.760- 08:31.340* :  You blood out.
*08:32.340- 08:37.640* :  Polls show Palestinians strongly support the attacks but like Israelis they tend not to believe
*08:37.660- 08:40.620* :  that their side could carry out atrocities.
*08:41.500- 08:47.900* :  Israel denies the allegation considered plausible at the world court that it's committing genocide in Gaza.
*08:48.800- 08:55.500* :  Demetri Dyliani a Palestinian Christian activist in Jerusalem says Israelis are deluding themselves.
*08:56.020- 08:57.780* :  Killing children is killing children.
*08:57.780- 09:00.420* :  It doesn't matter who is the child that's being killed.
*09:00.980- 09:02.700* :  It doesn't matter who is doing the killing.
*09:03.040- 09:04.920* :  I do sympathize with the Holocaust.
*09:04.920- 09:11.160* :  I recognize the Holocaust but that does not mean green light for Israel to commit genocide
*09:11.180- 09:14.260* :  against my people or any other people matter that.
*09:14.620- 09:18.180* :  The attacks of the 7th of October put the Palestinian Israeli conflict
*09:18.760- 09:23.360* :  back at the top of the global agenda but with both sides believing that the other
*09:23.360- 09:30.380* :  has carried out inhuman unforgivable crimes that agenda does not include a realistic
*09:30.420- 09:31.460* :  chance of peace.
*09:32.380- 09:33.000* :  Jeremy Bowen
*09:34.240- 09:39.660* :  The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog has condemned a drone attack on the Russian occupied
*09:39.660- 09:42.080* :  Zaparicia power plant in Ukraine.
*09:42.080- 09:46.700* :  Rafael Grossi said there had been three direct hits on the site.
*09:47.240- 09:49.520* :  Russia's nuclear agency has blamed Ukraine.
*09:49.520- 09:54.420* :  There's been no comment from the government in Kiev as we record this podcast.
*09:54.460- 09:57.960* :  The International Atomic Energy Agency is based in Vienna.
*09:58.320- 10:00.160* :  Bethni Bell is our correspondent there.
*10:00.540- 10:03.780* :  And I asked what the agency has said about the situation.
*10:04.200- 10:11.020* :  It says that drone attacks at Zaparicia have caused damage to the building that houses
*10:11.680- 10:13.820* :  one of its six reactors.
*10:13.820- 10:17.420* :  It says that this was a serious incident.
*10:17.580- 10:23.840* :  It says that nuclear safety, however, was not compromised which means that there was no
*10:23.840- 10:28.460* :  release of radioactive material as a result of the attack.
*10:28.460- 10:36.340* :  It also said that one casualty was reported by the Russians administrators who occupy the plant,
*10:36.400- 10:38.060* :  which is the largest in Europe.
*10:38.880- 10:43.000* :  And there have been some very strong comments from the head of the IAEA.
*10:43.280- 10:44.420* :  Rafael Grossi, haven't they?
*10:45.180- 10:49.800* :  Yes, he said that this kind of incident cannot happen.
*10:49.800- 10:51.560* :  He said it was a no-go.
*10:51.560- 10:58.760* :  He said that it was essential that both sides did not jeopardize nuclear safety.
*10:58.860- 11:05.440* :  And he said no one could benefit or gain any kind of military or political advantage from attacks
*11:06.220- 11:07.540* :  against nuclear facilities.
*11:07.540- 11:15.860* :  And he has warned repeatedly in the past about the dangers of military activity near a nuclear power plant.
*11:15.860- 11:21.500* :  And it's interesting that we've had this sort of situation for where both Russia
*11:21.500- 11:28.020* :  and Ukraine have regularly accused each other of shelling the plant and risking nuclear disaster.
*11:28.660- 11:34.580* :  Now, I understand that there are a number of IAEA monitors in and around Zappareja.
*11:34.800- 11:37.720* :  What can they do, as far as you know, on a daily basis?
*11:38.080- 11:43.260* :  There's a small team of IAEA experts stationed in Zappareja.
*11:43.860- 11:49.800* :  They are there to observe the situation that they have confirmed the reports by the Russian
*11:50.640- 11:51.720* :  administrative people who are there.
*11:51.720- 11:58.280* :  They're there to observe what is happening to the plant in terms of safety and security.
*11:58.300- 12:03.600* :  But of course, when it comes to observing what is happening militarily around there,
*12:03.600- 12:08.160* :  it's much harder for them because they are within the plant and have a very specific remit.
*12:08.900- 12:09.420* :  Bethany Bell.
*12:11.100- 12:12.040* :  Next to Iran,
*12:12.040- 12:16.880* :  and a group of six conservationists who've been detained in the country since 2018
*12:17.440- 12:18.160* :  are to be released.
*12:18.160- 12:22.540* :  The authorities in Tehran announced that they would be freed, along with other prisoners,
*12:22.540- 12:27.120* :  as part of an annual pardon to mark the end of the Muslim fasting month, the Ramadan.
*12:27.760- 12:32.280* :  The environmentalists, some of whom have dual nationality, were convicted of national security
*12:32.280- 12:35.460* :  offenses, and one of their colleagues died in jail.
*12:35.500- 12:41.720* :  James Menendez spoke to Professor Kaveh Madani, an Iranian environmental scientist,
*12:41.720- 12:45.140* :  and the former deputy head of Iran's Environment Department.
*12:45.660- 12:47.660* :  He also knows many of the detainees.
*12:48.140- 12:49.380* :  So what do we know about their release?
*12:50.320- 12:57.100* :  That's one of the best days for Iran's environment over the last few years,
*12:57.100- 13:02.600* :  and people are excited, although these people shouldn't have been pardoned.
*13:02.600- 13:06.980* :  They should have been compensated for the loss of opportunities for
*13:06.980- 13:14.560* :  and baseless accusations and the loss of like six years of their lives in prison.
*13:14.640- 13:16.840* :  But it's definitely a very good day.
*13:17.240- 13:20.320* :  Just remind us why they were arrested in the first place.
*13:20.320- 13:22.020* :  What was the context at the time?
*13:22.020- 13:27.380* :  I mean, there was a lot of pressure on the work of environmentalists in Iran at the time, wasn't there?
*13:28.300- 13:33.280* :  It's very hard to read and understand the Islamic Republic and its security operations,
*13:33.360- 13:38.680* :  and why they decided to go for the crackdown of the environmental activists at the first place.
*13:39.620- 13:44.320* :  The general thinking is that they realized how strong
*13:44.320- 13:50.780* :  the environmental space is in creating unity, regardless of your ideology in Iran.
*13:51.420- 13:56.140* :  Whether you support the Islamic Republic or not, if you are Shia Sunni,
*13:56.140- 14:01.660* :  a Christian, or you don't believe in God, or it doesn't matter what your ethnicity is,
*14:01.660- 14:04.960* :  you care about the environment, you care about clean air,
*14:05.000- 14:08.580* :  you care about the aegiatic cheetahs and biodiversity loss in Iran.
*14:09.220- 14:17.860* :  And that unprecedented power to unite people was scary for the security operations we believe,
*14:17.960- 14:19.400* :  you know, in my opinion.
*14:19.400- 14:25.320* :  And that is when they came after those who were active and trying to make a change,
*14:25.320- 14:30.340* :  inform the public, raise awareness, and essentially make the government accountable
*14:30.980- 14:35.460* :  for the damages they were essentially creating for the environmental sector.
*14:35.780- 14:42.000* :  And this bizarre detail about using camera traps to research aegiatic cheetahs,
*14:42.040- 14:46.720* :  and the sort of suggestion that somehow those camera traps were part of a spying effort.
*14:47.380- 14:54.040* :  So just to tell your audience about the background story, this group was known in the world
*14:54.040- 14:59.300* :  for their efforts to save the aegiatic cheetah, only about 50 of them left in the world,
*14:59.300- 15:01.160* :  and they're located in Iran.
*15:01.160- 15:04.420* :  So they were trying to find where they are located,
*15:04.420- 15:07.680* :  putting camera traps to study their behavior and find them.
*15:08.060- 15:13.580* :  And then yes, the security operations claimed that they were using the camera traps
*15:14.100- 15:20.280* :  for monitoring the ballistic missile activities and nuclear activities of Iran,
*15:20.280- 15:24.760* :  which turned out to be really funny to anyone who had a little bit of expertise.
*15:24.760- 15:28.320* :  And later on, they changed the story, but it was too late at the time.
*15:28.840- 15:32.360* :  One of the prisoners actually suspiciously died in the Evan prison,
*15:32.360- 15:39.580* :  and things became more escalated when there was a questioning why the general public
*15:39.580- 15:42.100* :  about what is happening to the environmental activists.
*15:42.400- 15:44.660* :  And just one final question, briefly, if you can.
*15:44.660- 15:47.760* :  Do you have any theories about why this poden is come now?
*15:48.500- 15:52.660* :  I think it's very hard to again understand the Islamic Republic,
*15:52.660- 15:57.160* :  but these people had no value for the system anymore.
*15:57.820- 15:59.840* :  They do all national, the only do all national,
*15:59.840- 16:05.100* :  the case had been already swapped with an American prisoner and some money.
*16:05.640- 16:11.480* :  And the rest of them essentially were like their prison time was coming to an end,
*16:11.480- 16:17.060* :  and keeping them there was more costly to them because the people of Iran kept asking
*16:17.060- 16:22.240* :  what's happening to them and why these people are held over six years in prison without
*16:22.240- 16:24.040* :  any proof of any wrongdoing.
*16:24.560- 16:29.320* :  Professor Kaveh Madani, the former deputy head of Iran's Environment Department.
*16:30.560- 16:36.760* :  Next to Denmark, and in the heart of Copenhagen, the neighborhood of Christiania has been a
*16:36.760- 16:41.820* :  haven of counterculture for over 50 years. Popular with tourists, it's known for its liberal
*16:41.820- 16:47.360* :  attitude towards cannabis, and most infamously, the open-air drug market, Pushestreet,
*16:48.040- 16:51.780* :  but criminal gangs have increasingly taken over there leading to rising violence.
*16:51.780- 16:55.520* :  Residents have fed up, so they decided to dig up the street.
*16:55.960- 16:56.920* :  Adrien Murray reports.
*16:58.020- 17:03.840* :  Armed with spades and crowbars, locals cheered and applauded as the first couples were priced
*17:03.840- 17:06.940* :  from the ground. We just speak what do you think of the U.S.
*17:08.820- 17:11.320* :  Watched on by a large crowd, the mood was celebratory.
*17:11.840- 17:17.300* :  This stone, like stone, Christiania's notorious Puchestreet is pulled apart.
*17:17.560- 17:22.400* :  Ah, it feels good. Now we are in working clothes. Now we start working and now we start
*17:22.400- 17:27.080* :  stop talking, start acting. It's closing down today, so it's kind of a closing party.
*17:27.240- 17:29.840* :  And we're taking off the bricks. Some of them are going home for seven years,
*17:29.880- 17:30.800* :  and others are being recycled.
*17:31.300- 17:35.420* :  The last like five, six years I haven't been here that much because I have had
*17:35.420- 17:39.820* :  a kid. I didn't feel like very safe. Today I brought all three of them, and they all
*17:40.200- 17:40.240* :  helping.
*17:42.200- 17:47.020* :  Those illegal in Denmark, cannabis has been sold on this one hundred meter stretch of road,
*17:47.080- 17:51.500* :  for decades, less than a kilometer from the Danish Parliament.
*17:52.620- 17:56.780* :  Before today, you might find 20 dealers in this very spot,
*17:56.780- 18:00.800* :  hooking weed from behind makeshift stacks of beer crates,
*18:01.080- 18:05.360* :  and plywood market stalls, with names like Green Rocket and Blue Dream.
*18:06.100- 18:08.700* :  But now it's a totally different scene.
*18:09.980- 18:14.460* :  Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummergaw says the action is more than just symbolic.
*18:14.980- 18:21.680* :  Today is, say, historical day. It's the beginning of the end of the very, very deep roots
*18:22.420- 18:27.500* :  that organised crime gangs have established in this neighbourhood of Copenhagen.
*18:29.660- 18:33.320* :  For a long time, Christiania had resisted efforts to close Prussia Street,
*18:33.340- 18:38.900* :  but this summer, restaurants decided it had to go. And in an extraordinary step,
*18:39.500- 18:43.300* :  this once rebellious group had been working together with the authorities.
*18:44.160- 18:48.920* :  Hold the Maida is a community spokesperson who's lived in Christiania for 40 years.
*19:04.720- 19:08.540* :  Local dealers have increasingly been pushed out as hardcore gangs of
*19:08.540- 19:13.220* :  rustic control of the business. And in the last three years, there's been a spate of
*19:13.220- 19:18.260* :  stabbing and fatal shootings. Police raided Prussia Street over 100 times last year,
*19:18.660- 19:23.940* :  but the dealers have kept coming back. Deputy police inspector Simon Hansen oversees the police
*19:23.940- 19:29.560* :  operation in Christiania. I think this time it's very different because we have all parties
*19:29.560- 19:34.420* :  around the table. Christiania wanted the police know how to handle it. We've tried during
*19:35.460- 19:40.640* :  this winter, we tried to close down the market for a couple of days just to see what is the
*19:40.640- 19:45.280* :  reaction. I have a lot of experience from when the area was closed during Corona.
*19:46.100- 19:50.360* :  I think overall we are pretty prepared to handle what is going on.
*19:50.980- 19:56.040* :  Free time Christiania was founded back in 1971 when a bunch of anarchists and hippies
*19:56.040- 20:01.860* :  got it inside of vacant military base and established a semi-autonomous commune with its own
*20:01.860- 20:08.000* :  rules and flag. More than 50 years later, the commune still survives, but it's not the same hippie
*20:08.000- 20:14.680* :  utopia. Today around 1,000 people, including 250 children, live in the graffiti covered barracks
*20:14.940- 20:19.980* :  and quirky wooden cottages that are strung out along the city's leafy historic ramparts.
*20:21.160- 20:25.760* :  Beyond shuttering Prussia Street, the community is taking other steps to secure its future
*20:26.400- 20:31.880* :  with new housing and investment, but something that might change the character of Christiania.
*20:32.340- 20:35.260* :  So if he hears stop, Anderson is Kippen Hagen's Lord Man.
*20:35.260- 20:39.760* :  Christiania has been gradually becoming older and what Christiania needs is a
*20:39.760- 20:45.380* :  reverbillization with young people when when some of this crime and the gangs and the pushes are
*20:45.740- 20:50.260* :  coming away from Prussia Street, I think that a lot of young creative souls will actually move
*20:50.260- 20:54.100* :  into Christiania and Christiania needs them in order to survive.
*20:55.640- 20:59.340* :  It's actually what will replace Prussia Street is still to be decided,
*20:59.880- 21:03.900* :  but Holden Nader tells me they want to get back to Christiania's creative roots.
*21:04.800- 21:10.800* :  We have ideas about how to build stuff and how to create new arts and make a playground
*21:10.980- 21:17.460* :  and a theater and also some artistic things that brings people here and shops and
*21:17.460- 21:20.040* :  who make it another life down in that street.
*21:22.580- 21:24.280* :  That report was by Adrian Murray.
*21:26.100- 21:30.080* :  Still to come. These measures are mainly going to be focused on low skilled workers,
*21:30.080- 21:35.000* :  so anyone wanting to come to New Zealand will have a shorter time to stay in New Zealand.
*21:35.000- 21:38.160* :  They'll have tougher English tests to get there in the first place.
*21:38.360- 21:43.240* :  New Zealand is tightening its visorals with immediate effect after the number of migrants
*21:43.240- 21:46.500* :  entering the country last year reached a near record level.
*21:53.000- 21:57.620* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are
*21:57.620- 22:02.220* :  allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising
*22:02.220- 22:06.920* :  prices technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said, what the **** are you
*22:06.920- 22:11.860* :  talking about? You insane Hollywood ****. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited
*22:11.860- 22:17.300* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month. Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash Switch.

*22:57.940- 23:02.660* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Now, a failure by the international community,
*23:02.660- 23:08.780* :  either by contempt or by cowardice. That is the assessment of the Rwandan President Paul Kagami
*23:08.800- 23:15.540* :  as he held a ceremony to mark 30 years since the genocide there in which 800,000 mostly ethnic
*23:15.540- 23:21.340* :  tutses were killed. Current and former world leaders have been meeting in the capital Kigali,
*23:21.340- 23:26.880* :  including Bill Clinton, who's described the genocide as the biggest failure of his U.S. Presidency.
*23:27.420- 23:30.660* :  Our Deputy Africa Editor and Soy reports from Nairobi.
*23:30.660- 23:37.220* :  As Somba ceremony in Kigali and the moment of reflection for the world,
*23:37.600- 23:41.100* :  withstands accused of failing to help Rwanda in her time of need,
*23:41.800- 23:46.900* :  UN peacekeepers stood by as hundreds of thousands of tutses and moderate hutses were killed,
*23:46.900- 23:52.560* :  about a quarter of a million women raped and families displaced. There was no external
*23:52.560- 23:58.640* :  intervention to stop the bloodshed. The massacre was sparked during the civil war in 1994
*23:58.640- 24:04.760* :  when the plane carrying the Hutu President was shot down. Hutu forces then rampaged across
*24:04.760- 24:11.060* :  Rwanda and the killings were only stopped when tutsi forces led by Paul Kagami to control of the
*24:11.060- 24:17.460* :  country. President Kagami lit the flame of remembrance in Kigali. It will burn for the next 100 days
*24:17.460- 24:23.920* :  to signify the time it took his forces to end the killings. Rwanda was completely humbled
*24:25.760- 24:35.400* :  by the magnitude of our loss and the lessons we learned are engraved in a blood.
*24:36.300- 24:40.460* :  A spot of national mourning this week, flags will fly at half-must,
*24:40.460- 24:46.440* :  bars and clubs will stay closed and local media will refrain from showing sports and films
*24:46.440- 24:52.160* :  and playing music except where it's dedicated to the memorial. The message from Kigali
*24:52.160- 24:59.860* :  never forget and never repeat anywhere. And soy in Nairobi.
*25:01.260- 25:07.720* :  The owner of the ex-social media platform Elon Musk has called for the resignation or impeachment
*25:07.720- 25:14.520* :  of a Brazilian Supreme Court judge who ordered him to block a number of accounts. Mr. Musk says
*25:14.520- 25:19.700* :  he will ignore the judge's ruling. Leonardo Roshiro reports. Mr. Musk said that the judge,
*25:19.700- 25:25.300* :  Alexandre de Morais, had repeatedly betrayed the Constitution and the people of Brazil. He said
*25:25.300- 25:30.520* :  that Mr. Morais ordered the ex-platform, which was formerly known as Twitter, to block the accounts
*25:30.520- 25:36.480* :  of individuals who post messages deemed anti-democratic. Many of them are supporters of the former
*25:36.480- 25:42.580* :  right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who called Elon Musk a true hero of Brazilian democracy.
*25:43.240- 25:48.640* :  Mr. Musk said the judge had imposed heavy fines on ex and threatened to arrest its employees.
*25:49.660- 25:54.960* :  Leonardo Roshiro. Last year, the authorities in New Zealand reported that the number of migrants
*25:54.960- 25:59.920* :  entering the country had reached a near-record level that's after a lull during the coronavirus
*25:59.920- 26:06.620* :  pandemic. Now, it says it is tightening its visa rules with immediate effect. Jackie Leonard spoke
*26:06.620- 26:11.300* :  to our Asia-Pacific regional editor, Mickey Brista, and asked him for more about these measures.
*26:11.960- 26:16.960* :  These measures are mainly going to be focused on low skilled workers, so anyone wanting to come to
*26:16.960- 26:22.240* :  New Zealand will have a shorter time to stay in New Zealand. They'll have tougher English tests to
*26:22.240- 26:27.280* :  get there in the first place. They'll also have to show that they've got proper work experience
*26:27.280- 26:32.480* :  for the jobs that they want to take in New Zealand. Essentially what the government there is saying
*26:32.480- 26:37.920* :  is that it wants to balance out the needs of the economy for workers with other wider interest
*26:37.920- 26:44.000* :  in New Zealand. For example, lots of immigrants coming into a country puts a pressure on infrastructure,
*26:44.000- 26:49.340* :  such as hospitals, schools, transport networks, that kind of thing. So, the government says it
*26:49.340- 26:54.660* :  wants to balance that out, reduce gradually the number of low skilled workers coming to New Zealand,
*26:54.660- 27:00.780* :  and increase the amount of skilled workers, which there's still shortage in the economy,
*27:00.780- 27:05.280* :  such as secondary school teachers. So, that's essentially what the government's trying to do.
*27:05.580- 27:09.340* :  And the government, the New Zealand actually elected a right-wing government last November,
*27:10.100- 27:12.480* :  to what extent is this about domestic policies?
*27:12.820- 27:16.380* :  There is certainly some of that going on, as you say. Last year, there was an election,
*27:16.380- 27:20.080* :  a right-wing government replaced the Labour government. Labour government was more
*27:20.580- 27:25.680* :  amenable to, to immigration, and there seemed to have a more relaxed attitude towards it.
*27:25.680- 27:29.780* :  If you look at the press release, the current government has put out the immigration minister talks
*27:29.780- 27:36.120* :  about levels being unsustainable. Political language, which suggests their attitude towards
*27:37.000- 27:42.680* :  immigration isn't quite the same as the previous Labour government. There is an economic change,
*27:42.680- 27:47.380* :  or there has been an economic change, which is driving this as well, though. After the pandemic,
*27:47.380- 27:53.740* :  there was a genuine shortage of workers in New Zealand, the economy was rebounding,
*27:54.160- 27:59.540* :  it needed more workers, and so they tried the government to get in more workers. Those jobs have
*27:59.540- 28:03.640* :  now been filled to a large extent. So, there is an economic reason for the current government
*28:04.100- 28:06.120* :  to restrict the number of people going to New Zealand.
*28:06.140- 28:11.980* :  Mickey Bristo. Now, to some good news for one of the world's most endangered mammals,
*28:11.980- 28:17.340* :  the Javan rhinoceros. A new calf has been spotted by Hidden Camera,
*28:17.700- 28:23.460* :  a one of Indonesia's national parks. James Menendez spoke to Joe Shaw, Chief Executive,
*28:23.460- 28:28.420* :  of Save the Rhino. Really exciting news today from the Ministry of Environments
*28:28.620- 28:33.800* :  and Forestry in Indonesia, that a new Javan rhino calf has been recorded for the first time
*28:34.100- 28:38.920* :  as part of an ongoing programme for this critically endangered species. As you've mentioned,
*28:38.920- 28:44.420* :  Javan rhinoceros are critically endangered. There may only be 76 animals remaining,
*28:44.420- 28:49.260* :  that the Ministry has previously reported that up to 12 of these animals may actually be missing.
*28:49.260- 28:54.380* :  So, very exciting that we are seeing new additions to this population.
*28:54.920- 28:59.680* :  Am I right in thinking that these the Javanese rhinoceros, they only carve every two years,
*28:59.720- 29:02.640* :  is that right? So, actually, this is quite a rare event.
*29:03.000- 29:07.100* :  Yeah, it's a very rare and exciting thing. We don't know very much about Javan rhinoceros,
*29:07.100- 29:12.120* :  they probably live about 30 or 40 years, their gestation period is probably about 15 or 16 months,
*29:12.780- 29:18.660* :  and new calves are rare. One female was recorded on on camera last year and one year before.
*29:18.860- 29:24.500* :  How protected are they in Indonesia? Well, one of the biggest concerns for Javan rhinoceros is that
*29:24.540- 29:29.260* :  the species now only occurs in a single park, the Ujong-Kuilong National Park,
*29:29.320- 29:34.280* :  on the extreme southwestern tip of Javan, on a peninsula that's just connected to the mainland
*29:34.280- 29:40.760* :  by a very narrow isthmus. And, concerningly, it's only about 35 miles across the seas from the
*29:40.760- 29:47.660* :  Krakatoa volcano. So, a huge risky area for this species to be remaining in,
*29:48.040- 29:54.100* :  although we're seeing great dedication from government, NGO, partners and academics
*29:54.100- 29:57.320* :  in the monitoring and protection of these animals.
*29:57.960- 30:02.860* :  What's a, there's an environmental thread. Is there also a threat from man from trafficking
*30:02.860- 30:08.780* :  poaching? Yeah, so all five species of rhinos around the world have been threatened by habits
*30:08.780- 30:14.400* :  at loss over time, that remaining animals just occur in fragmented populations. But, additionally,
*30:14.400- 30:20.100* :  they are actively persecuted by human interventions and trafficking of their horns by
*30:20.100- 30:24.460* :  transnational organised crime networks. Just tell us a little bit about what it looks like,
*30:24.460- 30:28.220* :  because it's quite well known for this sort of armour-plated look. Is that right?
*30:28.820- 30:34.000* :  Yes, the Javan Rhino is closely related to the greater one-horned or Indian Rhino,
*30:34.640- 30:41.380* :  and they both have these almost armour-plating plates around the body giving them this tank-like
*30:41.380- 30:48.380* :  or prehistoric appearance. That was Joe Shaw from Save the Rhino. Now, for most people running
*30:48.380- 30:56.200* :  one marathon is quite enough, but a British 27-year-old man has decided to take this one step further
*30:56.200- 31:02.640* :  running a total of 385 across the entire length of Africa, becoming the first person ever to do so.
*31:03.420- 31:07.720* :  And after just under a year travelling across the continent, he has finally reached the
*31:07.720- 31:14.740* :  finish line in Tunisia. Carist Maidment reports. In January last year, 27-year-old Russ Cook from
*31:14.740- 31:20.960* :  South East England, otherwise known as the hardest Giza online, revealed his challenge to the world.
*31:20.960- 31:29.340* :  He was going to run the entire length of Africa all in the aid of charity. And more than 16,000
*31:29.340- 31:37.380* :  kilometres, 352 days and 16 countries later, he's reached the finish line in the most northern tip
*31:37.440- 31:43.740* :  of Tunisia. He's managed to raise just short of a million dollars, but his mission has been far
*31:43.740- 31:49.720* :  from smooth sailing. Only a few months in, Cook made headlines here in the UK as he and his
*31:49.720- 31:57.660* :  support team were robbed at gunpoint in Angola. I don't think I was that worried about getting
*31:57.660- 32:04.740* :  sure, but in that moment, you're trying to assess the guy to see how much of a threat he really is.
*32:05.220- 32:09.240* :  He's just going to take things which can have to allow it. Back on the road, the physical impact
