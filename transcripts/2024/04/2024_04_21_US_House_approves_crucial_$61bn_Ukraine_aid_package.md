*01:08.920- 01:13.800* :  I'm Alex Ritson, and in the early hours of Sunday, the 21st of April, these are our
*01:13.800- 01:14.540* :  main stories.
*01:15.100- 01:19.800* :  The US House of Representatives has approved a much delayed multi-billion dollar package
*01:19.800- 01:21.340* :  of military aid for Ukraine.
*01:21.380- 01:27.380* :  In a rare show of bipartisanship, Democrats and moderate Republicans saw off the opposition
*01:27.380- 01:33.360* :  of the far right, the outcome has been welcomed by President Zelensky, who said it makes both
*01:33.360- 01:35.120* :  Ukraine and the US stronger.
*01:35.760- 01:40.120* :  Dozens of people have drowned when a boat carrying mourners to a funeral capsized in the
*01:40.120- 01:41.480* :  Central African Republic.
*01:42.120- 01:46.160* :  In Spain's Canary Islands, thousands of people have joined protests against what they
*01:46.160- 01:49.180* :  say are unsustainable levels of masterism.
*01:51.460- 01:56.120* :  Also in this podcast, a big male officer kicked me very hard in the back.
*01:56.540- 01:58.960* :  Later, I began urinating blood.
*01:58.960- 02:03.460* :  The doctor told me my kidney was partly torn, the court fined me $50.
*02:04.140- 02:07.540* :  Inside Iran, the government has launched a new crackdown on women.
*02:12.100- 02:19.080* :  So Ukraine has finally got its wish, the $61 billion military aid package from the United
*02:19.080- 02:21.860* :  States that President Zelensky so desperately wanted.
*02:22.300- 02:26.760* :  Following months of delays by Republicans and the House of Representatives, the House has
*02:26.760- 02:28.960* :  now finally agreed the aid.
*02:28.960- 02:31.840* :  The bill now goes to the Senate and then President Biden.
*02:32.100- 02:34.040* :  Can it make any difference on the battlefield?
*02:34.580- 02:36.600* :  President Zelensky seems to think so.
*02:42.440- 02:44.300* :  Today we received the decision we expected.
*02:44.860- 02:49.680* :  The package of American support that we fought so hard for, and it's a very significant
*02:49.680- 02:54.300* :  package that will be felt by our soldiers on the front line, as well as by our towns
*02:54.300- 02:57.020* :  and villages that are suffering from Russian terror.
*02:57.600- 03:00.300* :  Today, the US House of Representatives voted.
*03:00.880- 03:03.560* :  Thank you to everyone for helping to save lives.
*03:06.280- 03:10.780* :  The delay in agreeing an aid package has allowed the Russian military to advance further
*03:10.780- 03:12.280* :  into Ukrainian territory.
*03:12.660- 03:17.680* :  Before the vote on Saturday, there were fierce arguments for and against sending aid to
*03:17.680- 03:20.800* :  Ukraine, especially from Republicans who support Donald Trump.
*03:21.260- 03:25.540* :  One of them, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, said America shouldn't be sending
*03:25.540- 03:29.180* :  billions of dollars overseas to fund wars in far off countries.
*03:30.260- 03:37.400* :  You see, the United States taxpayer has already sent $113 billion to Ukraine, and a lot
*03:37.400- 03:39.060* :  of that money is unaccounted for.
*03:39.840- 03:46.180* :  This is a continuance of a sick business model that the American government continues.
*03:46.300- 03:50.900* :  But Democrats and some Republicans united to defeat such arguments.
*03:50.900- 03:55.920* :  President Biden said they had come together to answer history's call, which he said he
*03:55.920- 03:57.540* :  had fought for months to secure.
*03:58.000- 04:00.700* :  I heard more from our Washington correspondent, Will Vernon.
*04:01.660- 04:04.600* :  Well this bill has already had quite a long life, hasn't it?
*04:04.600- 04:09.160* :  President Biden first introduced it to Congress exactly six months ago today.
*04:09.620- 04:14.320* :  Back then it was part of a package which also included measures to send aid to Israel
*04:14.320- 04:18.280* :  and Taiwan, and now those have all been split up into separate bills.
*04:18.660- 04:23.600* :  But the reason that this has been such a long time coming is firstly because the Republican
*04:23.600- 04:25.820* :  party is becoming more isolationist.
*04:25.820- 04:30.600* :  Many lawmakers are skeptical about sending billions of dollars to Ukraine.
*04:31.160- 04:35.080* :  Even the speaker Mike Johnson, he was a Ukraine skeptic too.
*04:35.640- 04:41.840* :  The other reason that this bill has been stuck is because many Democrats were unhappy with
*04:41.840- 04:43.080* :  the Israel part of it.
*04:43.080- 04:48.920* :  They didn't want aid being granted to the Israelis due to the conduct of the war in Gaza.
*04:49.600- 04:55.340* :  And some hard-line Republicans even threatened to oust Mr. Johnson as speaker if he brought
*04:55.340- 04:58.780* :  the Ukraine bill specifically to the floor of Congress.
*04:59.140- 05:01.200* :  So he's been pretty reluctant to do so.
*05:01.560- 05:05.680* :  But it seems that in the last few weeks something has changed.
*05:06.040- 05:10.840* :  Mr. Johnson's been under an awful lot of pressure from the White House, from the Ukrainians
*05:10.840- 05:12.280* :  and their supporters in Washington.
*05:13.020- 05:16.940* :  And what we understand is that he had a change of heart.
*05:16.940- 05:23.000* :  He became susceptible to these arguments that by not working to approve this aid to get
*05:23.000- 05:27.600* :  it on the floor of the House, he would find himself on the wrong side of history, helping
*05:27.600- 05:28.600* :  Vladimir Putin.
*05:29.320- 05:32.820* :  Obviously, most people here see Mr. Putin as an enemy of America.
*05:32.820- 05:37.080* :  So it seems he had a change of heart and eventually the bill was brought.
*05:37.080- 05:41.260* :  So what did President Biden say and when will this aid start arriving?
*05:41.260- 05:47.000* :  Mr. Biden issued a statement after that historic vote, thanking members of Congress for passing
*05:47.000- 05:52.080* :  what he called urgently needed legislation and he urged the Senate to quickly approve
*05:52.080- 05:57.120* :  it, which they almost certainly will, probably in the next few days, maybe on Tuesday.
*05:57.620- 06:01.340* :  After that, it will go to Mr. Biden's desk and he will sign it.
*06:01.620- 06:06.740* :  As soon as that happens, the weapon supplies can begin almost immediately according to
*06:06.740- 06:07.200* :  the Pentagon.
*06:07.220- 06:11.520* :  They said they've got all these deliveries packed up, basically prepared and ready to
*06:11.520- 06:14.020* :  go, ready to be sent off to the front lines.
*06:14.380- 06:17.480* :  We also had a statement from the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
*06:17.480- 06:23.340* :  He said, I welcome the passage of the critical national security supplemental, which will
*06:23.340- 06:28.980* :  allow the Department of Defense to surge life-saving security assistance to help Ukraine defend
*06:29.020- 06:30.400* :  itself from Russia's aggression.
*06:30.960- 06:31.880* :  Will Vernon?
*06:32.640- 06:37.420* :  Russia has condemned the package, saying it would further ruin Ukraine and lead to more
*06:37.420- 06:37.900* :  deaths.
*06:38.100- 06:43.800* :  Alexander Mareshko is MP for Ukraine's governing a servant of the People Party and head
*06:43.800- 06:46.100* :  of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Parliament.
*06:46.540- 06:48.420* :  He spoke to my colleague, Lee Stussette.
*06:48.820- 06:54.580* :  We feel great relief and the truth is that psychologically, politically, it's a truly
*06:54.580- 06:59.660* :  historic decision, which can be compared only to the land leased given to the UK during
*06:59.660- 07:00.740* :  the Second World War.
*07:01.440- 07:07.440* :  And you know, it gives us hope and this package and military aid will definitely save lots
*07:07.440- 07:11.020* :  of lives of our civilians and our soldiers.
*07:11.020- 07:14.280* :  It's tremendously important historic decision for us.
*07:14.900- 07:20.280* :  So we heard that they're expecting the munitions, the air defenses, the other military supplies
*07:20.280- 07:23.780* :  to be on their way to Ukraine shortly.
*07:23.780- 07:26.460* :  In fact, there's some reports they've been prepositioned.
*07:26.680- 07:28.940* :  Will they go directly to the battlefield?
*07:28.940- 07:31.120* :  Will there be an immediate impact?
*07:31.700- 07:38.680* :  Our president has already said today that the results of this decision will be felt really
*07:38.680- 07:41.600* :  soon by civilians and by our army.
*07:41.740- 07:47.800* :  So I assume that these weapons, it's been in the process or has already been prepared.
*07:47.800- 07:53.720* :  And soon it will reach our army, to reach frontline and we'll see concrete results on
*07:53.720- 07:54.280* :  the battlefield.
*07:54.900- 07:58.820* :  And I was in Ukraine in February, where everyone I met, whether people in coffee shops
*07:58.820- 08:06.380* :  or national security vibes, they all were really anxious about this money and why it
*08:06.380- 08:08.160* :  was being held up.
*08:08.220- 08:12.560* :  And you were losing on the front lines, what is the situation now?
*08:13.260- 08:19.840* :  The situation is difficult, but at the same time I'm sure that we have this return of
*08:19.840- 08:23.140* :  the hope and we feel that we were not left alone.
*08:23.600- 08:29.600* :  It gives us strength, it gives us courage and resolve to continue to fight and I'm sure
*08:29.600- 08:34.340* :  that the situation at the front will soon change in our favor.
*08:38.900- 08:43.840* :  I spoke to our correspondent James Waterhouse, who's in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev.
*08:44.760- 08:51.300* :  I think it's the ammunition issue, which is most pressing for Ukraine, because from the
*08:51.300- 08:58.380* :  moment Western help got bogged down, well, the US helped bogged down with this agreement
*08:58.380- 08:59.960* :  in Washington six months ago.
*09:00.620- 09:06.860* :  We've seen Ukrainian soldiers have to ration artillery shells and other forms of ammunition,
*09:06.980- 09:12.000* :  they've made fewer long-range missile strikes in areas close to the front line.
*09:12.880- 09:18.300* :  And it's what that has caused, which is significant for Ukraine, where Russia has used its
*09:18.300- 09:21.480* :  size to take hundreds of square kilometers.
*09:22.080- 09:26.360* :  Russia has enjoyed air superiority close to the front lines, which has allowed it to
*09:26.360- 09:32.440* :  take towns like Avdivka, an approach on another small town called Chazaviyar, which is strategically
*09:32.440- 09:36.060* :  significant because of it being a major transport hub.
*09:36.760- 09:41.080* :  And this war tends to have a domino effect when you're talking about static front lines.
*09:41.180- 09:47.620* :  If Russia has momentum, you find yourself with Ukrainian cities increasingly perilous.
*09:47.620- 09:53.060* :  So what this offering from America does is it offers the ammunition I mentioned.
*09:53.120- 09:58.900* :  It also offers air defense systems, as Russia continues to target Ukrainian cities.
*09:59.440- 10:04.080* :  And it will include armoured vehicles, which allow Ukraine to sort of keep up the fight
*10:04.080- 10:04.840* :  on the front line.
*10:04.840- 10:09.040* :  But we're not talking about Ukraine suddenly being able to change the tide and liberate
*10:09.040- 10:09.520* :  territory.
*10:09.980- 10:14.600* :  It just keeps Ukraine in the fight, and crucially, the negotiating table at bay.
*10:14.880- 10:16.860* :  So what is the latest on the fighting, James?
*10:17.360- 10:21.140* :  Well, at the moment, Russian forces are knocking on the door of Chazaviyar.
*10:21.300- 10:25.800* :  We have the head of the armed forces, Alexander Silisky, warning that the town could fall
*10:26.540- 10:26.860* :  soon.
*10:27.580- 10:34.080* :  And you have cities like Kupiansk in the Northeast, Constantinivka in the East, Kramatorsk.
*10:34.420- 10:38.540* :  Cities that have been got used to living near the war, but bracing themselves to what might
*10:38.540- 10:42.440* :  be coming over the horizon, because they know the Russian playbook here.
*10:42.440- 10:48.620* :  When they get near, they start to shell entire cities constantly, forcing most of their
*10:48.680- 10:49.900* :  population to flee.
*10:50.420- 10:55.880* :  And then you end up in a scenario, as with Backmood, as with Evdivka, where you have a Russian
*10:55.880- 10:59.760* :  flag planted in an area that has pretty much been reduced to rubble.
*11:00.220- 11:03.320* :  And it is something that Russia continually calls liberation.
*11:03.600- 11:06.620* :  So this is the state of things in the East.
*11:06.900- 11:12.300* :  You're having Ukraine enjoy some successes with drone strikes inside Russia itself, on
*11:12.300- 11:14.820* :  energy infrastructure, as well as across Crimea.
*11:15.460- 11:20.360* :  But the problem for Ukraine is this strategy feeds into the long game, whereas the reason
*11:20.360- 11:24.640* :  why this Western help is taken so long to arrive from America is because it hasn't been
*11:24.640- 11:27.440* :  able to deliver progress in the short term.
*11:27.440- 11:29.960* :  So things are extremely difficult for Ukraine.
*11:30.580- 11:32.100* :  James Waterhouse in Kiev.
*11:33.100- 11:38.900* :  Israeli forces say they've killed 14 Palestinian fighters in a raid in a refugee camp in the
*11:38.900- 11:40.840* :  north of the occupied West Bank.
*11:41.280- 11:45.920* :  Americans remain high across the region after a series of retaliatory strikes between Israel
*11:45.920- 11:49.860* :  and Iran, our correspondent, where a Davis reports from Jerusalem.
*11:50.600- 11:56.000* :  At times over the last few weeks, a regional conflict between Israel and Iran seemed a distinct
*11:56.000- 12:00.140* :  possibility, with both sides directly attacking each other's territory.
*12:00.800- 12:05.740* :  But some of that tension eased this weekend, as Iranian and Israeli leaders appeared to
*12:05.740- 12:10.180* :  either downplay the severity of the crisis or decline to mention it at all.
*12:10.920- 12:16.700* :  But an overnight attack on a pro-Iranian military base in Iraq is a timely reminder that Iran's
*12:16.700- 12:22.280* :  allies are present across the region, either through Hezbollah, in Lebanon, Houthis, in Yemen,
*12:22.740- 12:24.700* :  or militias in Iraq and Syria.
*12:25.400- 12:30.620* :  No one has claimed responsibility for the attack that Pentagon denied any involvement, but
*12:30.620- 12:36.340* :  images from the calso-based near Baghdad showed buildings damaged by an explosion, which
*12:36.340- 12:39.700* :  reportedly killed one person and injured several others.
*12:40.840- 12:43.060* :  Investigations across the region remain high.
*12:45.160- 12:49.540* :  In the occupied Palestinian West Bank, where there have been frequent clashes in recent
*12:49.540- 12:55.280* :  weeks, an Israeli military operation in the Nur Shams refugee camp is reported to have
*12:55.280- 13:00.420* :  killed at least 10 people, including a commander from the armed group Palestinian-Islamic
*13:00.420- 13:00.860* :  she had.
*13:01.480- 13:04.380* :  Palestinian sources said a child was among the dead.
*13:05.080- 13:09.380* :  But it's to the ongoing war in Gaza that Israel's main focus has returned.
*13:10.180- 13:15.340* :  There were overnight attacks by tanks and fighter jets in central and southern parts of
*13:18.440- 13:18.480* :  the strip.
*13:18.480- 13:22.900* :  The Nadja hospital in Raffa, parents and siblings consoled each other.
*13:23.320- 13:28.220* :  After several civilians, including children, were reported to have been killed in overnight
*13:28.220- 13:29.160* :  airstrikes.
*13:29.620- 13:34.960* :  Israel said it had attacked military infrastructure, compounds, and armed terrorists.
*13:35.880- 13:40.900* :  The United States and others have repeatedly urged Israel not to launch what is expected
*13:40.900- 13:46.980* :  to be a major offensive in Raffa, warnings that seem to have little impact on Benjamin Netanyahu.
*13:47.560- 13:53.420* :  Israel's Prime Minister has repeatedly said the offensive in Raffa must happen if Hamas
*13:53.420- 13:56.380* :  is to be defeated and Israeli hostages released.
*13:57.220- 13:57.880* :  We're a Davis.
*13:58.540- 14:03.200* :  In Iran itself, there have been reports that some are unhappy with their government's
*14:03.200- 14:09.300* :  threats towards Israel with people on Persian-language acts or Twitter, even calling the Revolutionary
*14:09.300- 14:10.440* :  Guard terrorists.
*14:10.860- 14:15.740* :  Now the clerical regime appears to be trying to reassert its authority with a renewed
*14:15.740- 14:17.920* :  crackdown by the morality police.
*14:18.340- 14:23.600* :  Param Kabadi from the BBC's Persian Service has been looking at videos of the morality
*14:23.600- 14:24.640* :  police at work.
*14:25.180- 14:30.980* :  It's really amazing that under the very same day that Iran attacked Israel, hours before
*14:30.980- 14:36.320* :  that it deployed massive number of police morality police under streets of Tehran and
*14:36.320- 14:42.520* :  they began a campaign called Light in order to crack down on women who are not wearing
*14:42.520- 14:45.220* :  observing their hijab, who are not wearing their headscarf.
*14:45.780- 14:52.340* :  So we've seen videos of women being violently arrested, beaten, and forced into police
*14:52.340- 14:52.780* :  vans.
*14:53.120- 14:58.060* :  In one video that shocked the nation, we see a woman who is after a confrontation with
*14:58.060- 14:58.980* :  the morality police.
*14:58.980- 15:07.320* :  She falls down and she has a see-zer, she has a fit of see-zer, and that was really shocking
*15:07.320- 15:11.200* :  because she's there, like, you know, shaking all over the floor.
*15:11.760- 15:18.680* :  And apart from that, we see that university students are also barred from entering the
*15:18.700- 15:21.980* :  campuses because they have not observed the hijab.
*15:21.980- 15:25.720* :  What we also managed to talk to some people inside Iran, one of them told me that in the
*15:25.720- 15:31.940* :  morality police station, many women were telling police officers that you do not dare fight
*15:31.940- 15:32.540* :  Israelis.
*15:32.560- 15:37.160* :  That's why you've started, you know, cracking down on us women.
*15:37.160- 15:44.380* :  But I also managed to talk to a woman who shared her experience when she was beaten
*15:44.380- 15:45.540* :  up that we can have a listen.
*15:46.000- 15:49.120* :  A big male officer kicked me very hard in the back.
*15:49.560- 15:52.000* :  Later, I began urinating blood.
*15:52.200- 15:56.480* :  The doctor told me my kidney was partly torn, the court fined me $50.
*15:57.120- 16:02.320* :  The judge warned me that if I am detained again, I will go to prison and will be banned
*16:02.320- 16:03.560* :  from traveling abroad.
*16:04.140- 16:09.840* :  Now this comes as I've been reading that some in Iran are not happy with the bellicose
*16:09.840- 16:13.220* :  attitude towards Israel saying, fix things at home first.
*16:13.480- 16:18.340* :  I mean, is this campaign by the morality police as well as Iran's attacks on Israel?
*16:18.340- 16:19.120* :  Is that all linked?
*16:19.120- 16:23.540* :  So I talked to many Iranian experts, analysts, Iranian women rights activists.
*16:23.540- 16:26.640* :  They all unanimously think that the both are linked.
*16:26.640- 16:35.340* :  Iran is using this, this iron fist crackdown to show that you cannot resist, revolt again.
*16:35.340- 16:38.920* :  Because as you remember two years ago, after the death of the Kurdish-Germanso, I mean
*16:38.920- 16:41.560* :  he protested, swept the country over hijab.
*16:41.780- 16:49.240* :  Now this is a huge gamble for Iranian authorities to again start a crackdown on women over hijab.
*16:49.240- 16:55.140* :  But all the analysts agree that this is in order to intimidate people, that if Iran is
*16:55.140- 17:00.160* :  attacked by Israel, if it's weakened by Israel, people do not dare to come onto the streets
*17:00.540- 17:01.120* :  and revolt.
*17:01.680- 17:05.220* :  Param Gabbadi from BBC Persian, talking to Oliver Conway.
*17:07.480- 17:08.200* :  Still to come.
*17:08.620- 17:16.500* :  I feel like I've lost community to something that was so pivotal to my tech journey.
*17:16.500- 17:23.220* :  A major international organization supporting women in tech runs out of cash and closes down.
*17:34.100- 17:39.080* :  Hi, this is Craig Robinson from Ways to Win and support for this podcast comes from

*18:44.260- 18:49.640* :  Officials in the Central African Republic say almost 60 people have died in a boat accident
*18:49.640- 18:52.240* :  on the Empoco River near the capital Bangi.
*18:52.700- 18:57.540* :  Most of the 300 passengers on the overcrowded ferry were traveling to attend a funeral.
*18:57.540- 19:02.060* :  A video of the incident has been posted online as Julian Bedford reports.
*19:02.780- 19:04.080* :  The footage is dramatic.
*19:04.780- 19:08.700* :  The boat sets off packed with mourners dangerously low in the water.
*19:09.500- 19:14.960* :  All of a sudden people start jumping off the vessel, which appears to collapse or disintegrate
*19:14.960- 19:16.580* :  rather than capsize.
*19:17.460- 19:23.220* :  Onlookers, including those in small boats, are frozen for seconds before rushing to the
*19:23.220- 19:24.800* :  aid of those now in the water.
*19:25.440- 19:30.760* :  That's how many drowns so close to the river banks is probably due to the numbers dragged
*19:30.760- 19:32.540* :  down as the boats emerges.
*19:33.640- 19:36.440* :  Some of the victims may not have been able to swim.
*19:37.020- 19:38.620* :  Julian Bedford with that report.
*19:39.740- 19:46.360* :  Last year, the Canary Islands hosted more than 16 million tourists, but many of the Spanish
*19:46.360- 19:49.360* :  archipelagos residents have now had enough.
*19:49.860- 19:52.060* :  Under the banner, the Canaries have a limit.
*19:52.540- 19:57.400* :  Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets demanding a rethink on what they call
*19:57.660- 19:59.440* :  an unsustainable tourism model.
*19:59.800- 20:02.040* :  Lidia Morales took part in the demonstrations.
*20:03.000- 20:06.880* :  The major problem is the model of massive tourism that is since decades.
*20:07.200- 20:12.540* :  And it's just destroying the island indeed and the life of the residents here.
*20:12.660- 20:14.800* :  We are feeling we're being pushed away.
*20:15.700- 20:17.580* :  Priorities are not taking it in consideration.
*20:17.720- 20:21.320* :  Actually, this is a complaint towards the politicians.
*20:21.400- 20:29.000* :  Priorities are more focused on making constructions towards tourism complex and hotels next to
*20:29.200- 20:30.320* :  a natural environment.
*20:30.820- 20:35.780* :  So what are the key issues Clio Oflin is a freelance journalist in Tenerife?
*20:36.120- 20:41.500* :  Like you just heard from your interview, the main thing is that there is a sense that
*20:41.500- 20:47.520* :  over tourism or a tourism boom has pushed locals out of their own homes in a sense.
*20:47.580- 20:52.400* :  And housing is one of the major issues, in fact, because what has happened with overbuilding
*20:52.400- 20:58.700* :  in certain areas is that price rises or rental rises combined with, say, second holiday
*20:58.700- 21:04.020* :  home buying by a lot of overseas buyers have meant that people who work in the tourism
*21:04.020- 21:06.440* :  sector can't afford to live there anymore.
*21:06.440- 21:11.000* :  And that is kind of causing a domino effect because people have to travel to work.
*21:11.180- 21:13.280* :  They're having problems getting to work.
*21:13.280- 21:16.480* :  Their families are living further and further away from centuries.
*21:16.980- 21:22.440* :  So there is a sense that in some parts of the island there needs to be a radical we think
*21:22.440- 21:26.860* :  of how tourism is structured, is managed and is sold.
*21:27.160- 21:29.540* :  There is talk of imposing a tourism tax.
*21:29.920- 21:30.620* :  Is that going to happen?
*21:30.620- 21:31.300* :  How would it work?
*21:31.700- 21:36.700* :  I think it might be considered of what's interesting today up until now it was very little
*21:36.700- 21:38.460* :  noise from any of the political parties.
*21:38.960- 21:42.100* :  But there was a much bigger turnout, I think, than people imagined.
*21:42.400- 21:49.280* :  The government say 32,000 in January, organizers say 80,000, either way, it was far beyond expectations.
*21:49.840- 21:54.880* :  And already this afternoon a spokesperson for the governing party at regional level have
*21:54.880- 21:58.760* :  said, let's sit down together, let's see what tomorrow brings.
*21:59.240- 22:06.780* :  So I think they need to start looking at how to, I suppose, control more licensing for
*22:06.780- 22:07.880* :  resort developments.
*22:08.360- 22:14.960* :  And very much how to look at rent controls and making more units, apartment blocks available
*22:14.960- 22:19.880* :  for residential rentals, rather than holiday buys and holiday let.
*22:20.240- 22:26.260* :  Because at the moment, as I say, you have swayed our certain pockets in tourist areas
*22:26.260- 22:32.640* :  where the vast majority now would be overseas holiday makers, rather than local canarians.
*22:32.740- 22:37.340* :  And local clearance includes people like me and a lot of foreign residents have made
*22:37.340- 22:38.400* :  this place their home.
*22:39.080- 22:42.080* :  freelance journalist Cleo Oflin in Tenerife.
*22:43.260- 22:48.100* :  One of London's best known arts institutions was built on what was once the hub of the
*22:48.100- 22:53.540* :  capital's textiles or rag trade after the area was virtually obliterated by World War
*22:53.560- 22:54.100* :  II bombing.
*22:54.560- 22:58.460* :  The Barbican is a bold, imposing or steer looking concrete building.
*22:58.520- 23:04.480* :  And usually it's very gray, but at the moment it's a sea of vivid pink and the front is
*23:04.480- 23:05.560* :  covered in cloth.
*23:06.000- 23:10.420* :  Many Dale has been down to the Riverside Terrace to find out what it's all about.
*23:11.360- 23:15.180* :  When you come from that side, wow, what is it?
*23:15.560- 23:20.680* :  I love the colours and the shapes look a bit like wrapped up sweets, so it's very impressive
*23:20.680- 23:21.260* :  the size.
*23:21.820- 23:22.660* :  I think it's awful.
*23:23.340- 23:26.680* :  It looks a bit like a mess to me.
*23:27.360- 23:32.060* :  Once provoking those different reactions is an artwork called purple highbiscuits.
*23:32.380- 23:34.980* :  To me it's actually a little bit more pink than purple.
*23:35.360- 23:42.940* :  It's huge 2,000 square metres of cotton cloth, hand-woven and hand stitched together in
*23:42.940- 23:48.020* :  Ghana and then draped over the Barbican Centre here in central London.
*23:48.420- 23:57.300* :  So on top of the fabric is about 130 traditional garments, their green, blue, orange and some
*23:57.300- 24:04.540* :  of them are inside out, so you can actually see the yellowish stain of sweat from the
*24:04.540- 24:10.760* :  person who wore them, they're from Northern Ghana and so is the artist who created purple
*24:10.760- 24:11.620* :  highbiscuits.
*24:12.360- 24:15.740* :  My name is Ibrahim Mahama, I'm a visual artist from Tamilie.
*24:16.280- 24:21.220* :  In Ghana we call it the Batakari, they wear it over a long period of time and they pass
*24:21.220- 24:22.900* :  it on from one generation to the other.
*24:23.180- 24:28.480* :  So what I do is that I engage with my collaborators and communities, I'll give them new smokes
*24:28.480- 24:32.880* :  in exchange for the old ones because my work is mostly born out of failure and decay.
*24:33.320- 24:38.180* :  When a material is stained it is somehow imbued with a ghost and also like these spirits
*24:38.180- 24:38.680* :  of history.
*24:39.040- 24:42.740* :  I always think that that's when it's beginning to live more because it contains history
*24:42.740- 24:43.700* :  within it.
*24:43.940- 24:49.340* :  Ibrahim says that some Ghanaians don't just hand over their Batakaris because it can feel
*24:49.340- 24:51.880* :  as if they're abandoning the memories of the family.
*24:52.680- 24:59.000* :  Instead they go through a ritual and they often put a bit of urine on the garments because
*24:59.000- 25:03.640* :  they believe that that can release the souls of their ancestors from the material.
*25:04.440- 25:07.840* :  So how did the artist put together such an enormous piece of art?
*25:08.180- 25:13.100* :  It was quite extraordinary to test what it means to be able to take a traditional form
*25:13.100- 25:15.620* :  like this and blow it into something very contemporary.
*25:15.620- 25:18.100* :  I thought why not use a stadium?
*25:18.700- 25:23.120* :  We worked with over 1,000 people to imagine all these people setting on a material showing
*25:23.800- 25:27.920* :  like the labor that is going into it and the barbecue basically was built with a lot
*25:27.920- 25:28.340* :  of labor.
*25:28.820- 25:33.380* :  After the concrete was cast the men had to chip off the surface of the concrete in order
*25:33.380- 25:34.640* :  to get a texture of the building.
*25:35.040- 25:39.200* :  So I thought what could be more beautiful than creating this relationship between these
*25:39.200- 25:40.020* :  two labor forms?
*25:40.880- 25:44.600* :  Not everyone is a fan of the art and some say it's nothing new.
*25:45.340- 25:50.440* :  The husband and wife team of Christo and Jean Claude famously wrapped a set of islands
*25:50.440- 25:53.060* :  off Miami back in the 1980s.
*25:53.640- 25:58.980* :  But Chanel Javari, the head of visual arts at the Barbican Centre, defends the exhibit.
*25:59.680- 26:03.400* :  It was acknowledged their influence on his work.
*26:03.760- 26:10.220* :  So of course when they started to wrap islands and monuments of great power it was striking
*26:10.220- 26:15.760* :  and the geopolitical social conditions in which they did it were different and also
*26:15.760- 26:22.660* :  their intentions were different and I think the quality of the work that Ibrahim has done,
*26:22.660- 26:29.800* :  the hand finished nature of it, the strong community and democratic aspect of it is something
*26:29.800- 26:37.500* :  that's quite specific to him but it shares in a visual language and an act of draping
*26:37.520- 26:41.140* :  and covering or wrapping that is familiar.
*26:41.740- 26:46.440* :  Chanel Javari, the head of visual arts at London's Barbican Centre, ending that report
*26:46.440- 26:52.860* :  by Penetail, it's emerged that despite testing positive for a banned substance, some Chinese
*26:52.860- 26:57.080* :  swimmers were cleared to take part in the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.
*26:57.120- 27:03.120* :  The World Anti-Doping Agency WADA has confirmed that 23 athletes had tested positive.
*27:03.560- 27:06.260* :  But half of them went on to compete at the Games.
*27:06.640- 27:10.120* :  Asia Pacific Editor Celia Hatton has been following the story.
*27:10.900- 27:18.060* :  This all dates back Alex to a domestic Chinese swim meet that took place right at the end
*27:18.060- 27:26.040* :  of 2020 and in the first few days of 2021 and it was a swim meet in the city of Shujajwang
*27:26.440- 27:32.380* :  meant to be sort of an internal trial to see which of China's top swimmers would be
*27:32.380- 27:34.800* :  able to go on to compete in the Olympics.
*27:34.800- 27:35.820* :  It was quite important.
*27:36.560- 27:43.000* :  After that swim meet, the Chinese Anti-Doping Agency got in touch with the World Anti-Doping
*27:43.000- 27:48.740* :  Agency and said we have found positive results in 23 of our top swimmers.
*27:48.800- 27:56.180* :  They found very small amounts of our performance enhancing drug called Trimit Hasidine and
*27:56.180- 28:01.440* :  they said that they had done some investigations along with Chinese police and decided that
*28:01.960- 28:06.460* :  these 23 swimmers had ingested the drug unwittingly.
*28:06.460- 28:11.600* :  They said they'd found traces of the drug in the hotel kitchen where all the swimmers had
*28:11.600- 28:17.080* :  been staying for this meet and because of this they had decided that this was unintentional.
*28:17.440- 28:23.760* :  Now what's key is that the World Anti-Doping Agency A decided to simply accept the Chinese findings.
*28:23.760- 28:29.200* :  They didn't question them. They say that's because they had no credible evidence to the contrary
*28:29.320- 28:35.620* :  and also that they all of this was conducted in secret. Nobody was told outside of these
*28:36.140- 28:40.720* :  internal conversations that this was happening and half of these athletes went on to actually
*28:40.720- 28:43.620* :  compete at the Olympics and in some cases win medals.
*28:43.800- 28:46.280* :  That's going to say a lot of them went on to win medals. Didn't they?
*28:46.280- 28:47.840* :  Should we read anything into that?
*28:48.080- 28:55.540* :  I will say that the Americans are very unhappy on finding this news. They say that these swimmers
*28:55.540- 29:00.260* :  should have at least been suspended if not banned from competing internationally.
*29:00.260- 29:05.460* :  They're also very upset that this was all done in secret and no one else was consulted.
*29:06.040- 29:12.220* :  Celia Hatton. In an increasingly digital world coding that's the language used to make
*29:12.220- 29:17.860* :  computer programs has never been more important but for years coding and the tech industry in general
*29:17.860- 29:23.480* :  have been male dominated areas and now one of the main organization supporting female
*29:23.480- 29:28.320* :  coders around the world has suddenly announced it will close and I beg more reports.
*29:29.000- 29:35.060* :  Women who code started in 2013 as a network in San Francisco for women tech engineers
*29:35.840- 29:40.480* :  navigating a male dominated industry. The movement grew offering scholarships conferences
*29:40.480- 29:47.820* :  and online classes with a community now spanning 360,000 people across 145 countries
