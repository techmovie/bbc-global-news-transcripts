*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*00:30.740- 00:32.320* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.

*00:50.980- 00:51.920* :  And also the problem.
*00:51.920- 00:55.540* :  And I knew that there is a way we can use technology to solve it.
*00:55.760- 00:58.840* :  People fixing the world from the BBC World Service.
*01:04.460- 01:07.640* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:10.160- 01:11.360* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:11.360- 01:15.000* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Thursday the 11th of April.
*01:15.840- 01:17.640* :  Palestinians mark the end of Ramadan,
*01:17.640- 01:20.120* :  but in Gaza, there is little to celebrate.
*01:20.720- 01:22.160* :  Now everything has changed.
*01:22.520- 01:25.240* :  And we no longer feel the joyful atmosphere of a feast.
*01:25.580- 01:26.400* :  There is no eat.
*01:26.920- 01:29.780* :  Instead, there are dead people wounded and injured.
*01:29.780- 01:34.080* :  This is a holiday of war in Northern Gaza.
*01:34.080- 01:36.500* :  Three sons of the Hamas leader Ismail Haneer
*01:36.500- 01:40.400* :  have been killed by Israel reportedly while traveling to an eat gathering.
*01:41.140- 01:44.460* :  Also, this is a voting session.
*01:44.460- 01:51.000* :  And I expect that this session is respected despite protest.
*01:51.000- 01:55.020* :  The European Parliament approves new tougher laws on migrants.
*01:55.840- 01:58.160* :  And we have a special report from Ecuador,
*01:58.160- 02:01.040* :  which now has one of the highest murder rates in Latin America.
*02:04.140- 02:05.120* :  Also in the podcast,
*02:05.120- 02:08.200* :  the mounting abuse claims at a boarding school in Jamaica.
*02:08.480- 02:09.020* :  And...
*02:09.400- 02:12.340* :  Dear Nike, is it possible to buy just one shoe?
*02:12.500- 02:13.880* :  Because I only have one foot.
*02:14.460- 02:17.440* :  The Paralympian with questions for the sports giant.
*02:22.640- 02:28.220* :  The Muslim Festival of Eid Al-Fitter is usually a time of joy as friends and families get together
*02:28.640- 02:30.940* :  to mark the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.
*02:31.500- 02:35.040* :  But for the people of Gaza celebrations this year are muted
*02:35.040- 02:37.220* :  as they contemplate thousands of deaths,
*02:37.220- 02:40.220* :  the destruction of their homes, and alluming famine.
*02:40.540- 02:44.020* :  This was the experience of children in the southern city of Rafa.
*02:44.520- 02:46.500* :  Last Eid, we were happy.
*02:46.920- 02:49.420* :  And my father used to take us to play in the amusement parks.
*02:49.420- 02:52.220* :  We used to celebrate and have parties with my aunts and cousins.
*02:52.840- 02:53.700* :  There is no Eid.
*02:54.220- 02:57.040* :  Instead, there are dead people wounded and injured.
*02:57.520- 02:59.220* :  This is a holiday rule.
*03:01.200- 03:04.160* :  Last Eid was one of the most beautiful times for me.
*03:04.620- 03:07.620* :  We used to bake cookies and cakes by new clothes
*03:07.620- 03:09.560* :  and get ready for a seething Eid.
*03:10.040- 03:11.940* :  But now all our loved ones have died
*03:12.100- 03:13.600* :  and there were no new clothes to buy.
*03:13.600- 03:14.060* :  We will.
*03:14.460- 03:15.760* :  There is no Eid.
*03:15.980- 03:16.500* :  No Ramadan.
*03:16.940- 03:18.300* :  We do not feel alive at all.
*03:18.540- 03:19.580* :  I have no clothes to wear,
*03:19.940- 03:22.200* :  except for two puzzle trousers and one dress.
*03:22.660- 03:26.340* :  On last year's Eid, we played, we celebrated and rejoiced together.
*03:26.620- 03:28.680* :  But this Eid, we miss the taste of happiness.
*03:30.180- 03:35.200* :  Journalist Gara Uda is also in Rafa having moved there from her home in northern Gaza.
*03:35.660- 03:38.800* :  There is no ritual or celebration of Eid.
*03:38.920- 03:41.760* :  This year, after six months of ongoing work,
*03:42.100- 03:45.900* :  people are losing their beloved people, relatives, friends,
*03:46.000- 03:52.640* :  and they just go to destroy mosques and pray the Eid prayer.
*03:52.640- 03:56.220* :  Most of the mosques here in Rafa are being destroyed.
*03:56.220- 03:59.460* :  But people like on the rubble of these mosques
*03:59.460- 04:01.160* :  are around these mosques.
*04:01.160- 04:05.220* :  They are doing the prayer and maybe in an oven area,
*04:05.420- 04:07.280* :  they can gather themselves like hundreds.
*04:07.780- 04:11.740* :  There is no ingredients to do some cakes or some sweets.
*04:11.740- 04:16.080* :  So people just maybe they are doing some tea, some coffee,
*04:16.080- 04:18.020* :  normal drinks, and that's it.
*04:18.220- 04:23.300* :  Gara Uda in Rafa, well, the leader of Hamas, Ismail Haneer, who lives in Qatar,
*04:23.960- 04:28.220* :  says in Israeli air strike, killed three of his sons and some of his grandchildren,
*04:28.220- 04:31.160* :  while they were on an Eid visit in northern Gaza.
*04:31.920- 04:34.300* :  Our international editor, Jeremy Bowen, told us more.
*04:34.800- 04:39.800* :  The air strike in Gaza was a shati camp, otherwise known as beach camp.
*04:39.800- 04:42.140* :  It's one of the camps in Gaza City.
*04:42.740- 04:46.380* :  According to local journalists who went to the scene and did various interviews
*04:46.480- 04:51.120* :  that we've seen with witnesses, they said that in the car,
*04:51.120- 04:54.920* :  there was a driver, there were three of the sons of Ismail Haneer.
*04:55.400- 04:57.500* :  Reports differ two or three grandchildren.
*04:58.380- 04:59.460* :  They were all killed.
*05:00.060- 05:02.320* :  Three missiles were used in the attack.
*05:02.960- 05:04.300* :  It was a powerful force.
*05:04.300- 05:07.740* :  Body parts were thrown into buildings around there,
*05:08.120- 05:11.900* :  though it was a very difficult scene for the people in the area.
*05:11.900- 05:17.620* :  They also told local journalists that the Haneers were going to visit martyrs,
*05:17.620- 05:19.160* :  in other words, bereaved families.
*05:19.820- 05:24.200* :  Now these railies very quickly say, yes, we did do this,
*05:24.540- 05:27.620* :  because those three men were going to commit an act of terror,
*05:28.020- 05:29.000* :  and we thwarted them.
*05:29.640- 05:32.980* :  It's possible that this was something to do with the ceasefire talks,
*05:33.100- 05:39.100* :  because, of course, Ismail Haneer is the senior Hamas political leader outside Gaza,
*05:39.940- 05:42.620* :  and he is intimately involved in the ceasefire talks,
*05:43.060- 05:44.740* :  and someone was filming it on a phone.
*05:44.740- 05:49.160* :  When he was told about this, he said the blood of my sons and grandchildren
*05:49.160- 05:52.060* :  is no more precious than any other Palestinian.
*05:52.060- 05:54.620* :  We will not change our position in the talks.
*05:55.100- 05:57.500* :  Their position in the talks is really quite entrenched,
*05:57.960- 06:03.020* :  effectively, in return for a ceasefire, and them giving up eventually all the hostages.
*06:03.500- 06:08.740* :  They want Israel out of Gaza for good 100% and not coming back in.
*06:09.100- 06:10.620* :  Now these railies are not going to accept that,
*06:10.680- 06:12.600* :  because they want to do that rougher operation.
*06:13.140- 06:16.920* :  They want to go into rougher in the south and finish off as they see it,
*06:17.160- 06:18.860* :  the remnants of Hamas.
*06:18.860- 06:22.500* :  So that is no recipe for a ceasefire, but on top of that,
*06:22.880- 06:26.140* :  there are indications that Mr. Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister,
*06:26.140- 06:30.000* :  does not want to have a ceasefire, because he wants to do that rougher operation,
*06:30.000- 06:34.940* :  because he's under pressure from his own ultra-nationalist supporters who say that if he doesn't do it,
*06:35.240- 06:37.460* :  they'll pull the plug in his government, they'll bring it down.
*06:38.220- 06:41.440* :  So there are suggestions that I've heard from well-informed sources tonight,
*06:41.440- 06:44.980* :  not in Israel, but in the region, close to the talks,
*06:45.500- 06:49.880* :  that perhaps Mr. Netanyahu is just trying to spin it out, play for time,
*06:49.880- 06:54.900* :  maybe sabotage the talks by giving the orders that this operation should go ahead.
*06:55.240- 06:56.800* :  Jeremy Bowen in Jerusalem.
*06:57.540- 07:01.380* :  Meanwhile, several US government officials have told the BBC that
*07:01.380- 07:06.200* :  internal dissent is growing over President Biden's stance on the war in Gaza.
*07:06.760- 07:10.920* :  Both current and former employees say his recent comments criticizing Israel
*07:10.920- 07:16.220* :  haven't gone far enough, and are calling for a formal evaluation of whether sending weapons
*07:16.220- 07:19.060* :  to Israel is now breaking international law.
*07:19.060- 07:23.860* :  The US State Department said staff were encouraged to make their views on policy known through
*07:23.860- 07:27.640* :  the appropriate channels. Tom Bateman reports from Washington.
*07:28.160- 07:32.140* :  President Biden's phone call with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week
*07:32.140- 07:37.460* :  was a defining moment in the US-Israel relationship after six months of war in Gaza.
*07:38.020- 07:42.600* :  He threatened to reassess policy towards the country if he didn't see action to reverse
*07:42.600- 07:49.040* :  the humanitarian catastrophe on the ground. As that has deepened, so has dissent within the US
*07:49.040- 07:54.540* :  government among some officials who see Washington at once arming Israel, but at the same time
*07:54.540- 07:57.520* :  failing to compel it to properly protect civilians.
*07:57.580- 08:03.140* :  Anel Sheeline was a foreign affairs officer at the State Department who resigned in protest at
*08:03.140- 08:07.920* :  US policy a fortnight ago. She says while last week's increase in pressure was welcome,
*08:07.920- 08:13.880* :  it was too little too late. Clearly, the president has significant leverage to use here,
*08:14.440- 08:21.180* :  and yet what we're seeing in terms of opening the eras crossing is really woefully inadequate.
*08:21.620- 08:26.900* :  Famine is occurring inside Gaza. There has to be so much more.
*08:27.180- 08:30.500* :  Earlier this year, hundreds of American and European civil servants
*08:30.540- 08:35.800* :  signed a letter warning their government's risks being complicit in grave violations of international
*08:35.860- 08:41.320* :  law over continued military backing for Israel, given the spiraling civilian casualty rate.
*08:41.980- 08:46.900* :  In the last week, the BBC has spoken to four US civil servants and three former officials
*08:46.900- 08:53.020* :  who reflected growing exasperation in government. One with two decades national security experience
*08:53.420- 08:58.620* :  said after the Biden Netanyahu call they believed Israel had done the bare minimum to get through
*08:58.620- 09:04.640* :  the day and prevent a halt on US weapons. Israel has consistently denied breaching international
*09:04.640- 09:10.560* :  humanitarian law in Gaza, blaming Hamas for basing itself in civilian areas and saying military
*09:10.560- 09:16.120* :  pressure is required to ensure it can get its hostages out. Tom Maaman in Washington
*09:16.960- 09:23.000* :  Migration has been a politically sensitive issue in Europe since at least the 2015 migrant crisis.
*09:23.100- 09:28.660* :  With European elections just eight weeks away, Parliament in Brussels on Wednesday voted
*09:28.660- 09:33.800* :  through a package of laws designed to toughen border controls, speed up deportations,
*09:34.280- 09:37.220* :  and share out the burden of arrivals across the EU.
*09:37.820- 09:40.620* :  It was approved despite protests from the visitor's gallery.
*09:42.600- 09:44.000* :  This is a voting session.
*09:46.880- 09:55.960* :  This is a voting session and I expect that this session is respected. We are in a sovereign moment.
*09:58.620- 10:03.440* :  Well, Greece and Germany called it historic, but Poland said it wouldn't accept the new
*10:03.440- 10:08.340* :  relocation mechanism. So what will this package mean for people arriving in Europe?
*10:08.740- 10:10.260* :  I ask Nick Beak in Brussels.
*10:10.740- 10:15.220* :  Well, predominantly Oliver, it deals with what's called irregular arrival. So in other words,
*10:15.220- 10:19.780* :  people coming to Europe by boat and the likes of Spain, but particularly Greece and Italy,
*10:19.780- 10:24.240* :  have been the three countries really are the forefront of that, taking in so many people.
*10:24.240- 10:29.620* :  And the whole idea is that the system is speeded up. So asylum claims will be assessed,
*10:29.700- 10:34.980* :  hopefully within 12 weeks. That's the aim. For people who it looks like their case is very,
*10:34.980- 10:39.780* :  very weak. They may be sent to a so-called third country, which is deemed to be safe. So in
*10:39.780- 10:43.900* :  other words, they wouldn't stay in the country in which they arrived while their fate was considered.
*10:43.900- 10:50.060* :  And also, there is more funding for reception and processing centres to be set up in places like
*10:50.060- 10:57.220* :  Italy and Greece. We heard, as I said, that Poland doesn't like this mechanism to relocate
*10:57.220- 11:03.560* :  arrivals. I thought this was designed to sort of solve the problem of sharing out the responsibility
*11:03.560- 11:07.600* :  across Europe. Well, absolutely. And that has been a major obstacle to getting any sort of
*11:07.600- 11:12.860* :  deal over the past decade or so. What the European leaders, those in the majority, seem to think,
*11:12.860- 11:17.460* :  was that they had some sort of solution here whereby countries in the north, so traditionally
*11:17.460- 11:22.820* :  richer countries, the likes of France and Germany, would be taking their share of people who arrive
*11:23.040- 11:27.380* :  in Europe. However, there has been this sort of secondary element put in place,
*11:27.380- 11:33.120* :  which also the Polish don't like. And that is that they're able to pay per person arriving,
*11:33.120- 11:39.120* :  that the figure is 20,000 euros. However, I think there's also this other system which
*11:39.500- 11:43.560* :  has been snuck in. And that is that the Poles and others who don't particularly like this
*11:43.560- 11:49.340* :  can send expertise to try and deal with the migrant crisis, which seems to be coming back in
*11:49.340- 11:55.120* :  Europe at the moment. Anger from both left and right over this. Yeah, the far right, which for them,
*11:55.120- 11:59.960* :  traditionally, anti-migrant feeling has won them a lot of votes. They say this is too weak,
*12:00.380- 12:06.600* :  and it will open the floodgates to use a phrase used by a prominent Hungarian lawmaker. On the left,
*12:06.600- 12:10.460* :  you've got people saying that this is an erosion of people's fundamental human rights,
*12:10.460- 12:16.100* :  and we've got more than 150 charities who look after migrants saying that this is a dark day,
*12:16.100- 12:21.580* :  and that people's rights will be eroded. Nick Beak in Brussels. It is three months since
*12:21.580- 12:26.920* :  gunmen took over a live TV broadcast in Ecuador, prompting the government to declare the country
*12:26.920- 12:32.120* :  was in a state of internal armed conflict. It was the most visible episode of the
*12:32.120- 12:37.020* :  worst security crisis in Ecuador's history, provoked by violence among criminal gangs.
*12:37.020- 12:42.840* :  The president Daniel Neboa recently said the internal armed conflict declaration would remain
*12:42.840- 12:48.560* :  in place, reinforcing the power of the military. Later this month, the public will vote on further
*12:48.560- 12:53.440* :  measures like stricter gun controls and tougher prison sentences to try to tackle the violence.
*12:53.500- 13:00.000* :  So how is Ecuador, once known as an island of peace, now one of the most dangerous countries in
*13:00.000- 13:06.660* :  Latin America, BBC Windows, Ana Maria Rura, returned home to find out. Ecuador's government has
*13:06.660- 13:15.940* :  in effect declared war on its gangs. Heaving the capital Kito, truckloads of soldiers are
*13:15.940- 13:22.280* :  carrying out their now daily patrols. They stop and search some people. They've made more than
*13:22.280- 13:31.340* :  16,000 arrests in three months. It's incredible to see Kito a city that used to be very quiet and
*13:31.340- 13:36.280* :  very touristic like this with this amount of military forces on the street.
*13:38.080- 13:43.820* :  Just five years ago, I never thought I'd be reporting in Ecuador, wearing a bulletproof vest
*13:43.820- 13:52.260* :  and helmet. In January, an evening news program itself became a headline when masked
*13:52.460- 14:00.320* :  gunmen took over a life broadcast. It showed the world how gang violence has gripped Ecuador.
*14:03.560- 14:09.300* :  A member of one of the biggest and most violent gangs in Ecuador has agreed to speak to us.
*14:09.740- 14:14.540* :  Tensions are really high here in Wirekill, so he always has to be on the move.
*14:16.420- 14:21.880* :  Paúl, not his real name, sits down with us in a car. Paúl started dealing drugs for his
*14:21.880- 14:29.300* :  local gang, aged 15. Since then, the situation has changed dramatically. Things are dangerous right now.
*14:29.300- 14:35.160* :  That can come at you from anywhere. Global demand for cocaine has surged over the past decade,
*14:35.160- 14:39.940* :  and people like Paúl have started trafficking larger and larger quantities.
*14:39.940- 14:46.300* :  He listed a new alien. After I press him about his new role, he admits he has killed people.
*14:46.900- 14:53.540* :  I feel remorse for taking people's life. They had done really bad things, but who am I to take anyone's
*14:53.540- 14:59.440* :  life? Ecuador's official murder rate has shot up since the illegal drugs boom overtaking Colombia
*14:59.440- 15:07.140* :  and Mexico. I asked Paúl why there is so much violence. Everyone wants territory,
*15:07.780- 15:13.020* :  for selling the drugs for trafficking. Ever since, foreign cartels started contacting the
*15:13.020- 15:19.700* :  guys here to get them to traffic drugs. 90% of Ecuador's illegal drug exports
*15:19.700- 15:29.480* :  leave its biggest port in the city of Wirekill. The Coast Guard has stepped up its patrols,
*15:29.760- 15:36.300* :  and I joined the commander on a speedboat. In the past, we were dealing with common criminals.
*15:36.800- 15:39.860* :  Now anyone we see could have high caliber weapons.
*15:42.040- 15:47.560* :  We pass on the bridge where we can see gang names tag with graffiti. The Latin kings,
*15:47.580- 15:54.580* :  los lobos, they are all marked in their territory. It's the tarf war Paúl was telling us about.
*15:55.220- 15:59.520* :  This is where gangs compete to smuggle cocaine into shipping containers.
*16:02.260- 16:07.700* :  Lots of people inside the system are corrupt. Sometimes I can tell that the containers have been
*16:07.700- 16:13.660* :  contaminated at checkpoints inside the port, but mostly they are coming already contaminated.
*16:15.100- 16:20.600* :  Ecuador's authorities are investigating claims of corruption across its institutions.
*16:21.320- 16:28.380* :  Michel Luna dreamt of becoming a public prosecutor since she was six. Her voice breaks when she
*16:28.380- 16:37.400* :  describes the state of her country. Six of her colleagues have been killed in the past two years,
*16:37.400- 16:44.700* :  and now she fears for her life. If we don't get any more guarantees about our safety,
*16:44.700- 16:51.620* :  I will have to resign. Lawyers haven't studied and practiced for years to do a job that is suicidal.
*16:52.440- 16:58.860* :  Stopping the gangs is a major challenge. Despite the army's presence, the violence has not
*16:58.860- 17:04.980* :  subsided, and there is a growing unease. How long can the government keep trips on the street?
*17:05.020- 17:11.260* :  Anna Maria, and when the BBC put all these issues to Ecuador's government, it told us it had
*17:11.260- 17:16.420* :  quote, dramatically reduced the number of violent deaths eliminated the power of organized gangs in
*17:16.420- 17:22.100* :  prisons, investigated cases of corruption, and was winning the fight against the mafia.
*17:22.100- 17:28.780* :  And you can watch Anna Maria's documentary Inside Ecuador Rise of the Gangs on the BBC News YouTube
*17:28.780- 17:34.720* :  page. Next to a graduation celebration that's proved popular on Instagram.
*17:40.680- 17:45.860* :  Women's students in Iran are seen dancing, dancing and riding a motorcycle. They're dressed in
*17:45.860- 17:52.120* :  formal graduation robes with academic mortarboards over their headscarves. But the authorities at
*17:52.120- 17:57.460* :  Al-Safra University in southern Iran are not happy about it and have threatened to prosecute them.
*17:58.000- 18:00.740* :  I heard more from J.R. Goll of the BBC Persian Service.
*18:01.220- 18:06.280* :  If you listen to the music, it's very upbeat, and you see in the video those girls are moving
*18:06.280- 18:11.620* :  their body, something is prohibited in Islamic Republic of Iran. If they didn't have a headscarf,
*18:11.780- 18:16.580* :  you could mistaken them with this university student in London on Sydney or New York. But obviously
*18:16.580- 18:22.000* :  they are happy, joyously celebrating their graduation, but being happy and dancing to the tune of the
*18:22.000- 18:27.480* :  music, which is very upbeat in southern Iran, it has upset authority. What might the authorities do?
*18:27.780- 18:31.680* :  I think obviously they've been threatened to prosecute them. Don't forget, just a month ago,
*18:31.680- 18:38.640* :  another university sports science graduation boys and girls video very creatively. They edited
*18:38.640- 18:43.000* :  the video and put it on social media. They shut down the social media account on Instagram and
*18:43.220- 18:46.940* :  TikTok and other places, and then suddenly you see another part of the country. Another woman
*18:46.940- 18:52.780* :  group removed their headscarf defiantly. But I think they are threatening those students. They
*18:52.780- 18:59.360* :  might find those people who filmed and edited and put it on social media prosecute them, but
*18:59.680- 19:04.500* :  I don't think they can stop them. Do these students know they're basically taking a risk by
*19:04.500- 19:09.440* :  posting this stuff and putting it up anyway? Absolutely. Don't forget, a little more than a year ago,
*19:09.440- 19:16.840* :  a woman was killed in police custody for showing off a little bit of hair, massagina amini. I think
*19:16.840- 19:22.940* :  since that uprising, many women in Iran, particularly generations, Zed and this new generation,
*19:22.940- 19:29.220* :  defiantly removing their headscarf, or dancing in the street, somewhere in the iconic places
*19:29.220- 19:33.600* :  with the monument behind them in Tehran and other cities, they just want to show this content
*19:33.600- 19:39.240* :  with Islamic Republic of Iran. Are there Iranians outside the authorities, ordinary Iranians who
*19:39.240- 19:44.500* :  are offended by this kind of thing? I'm pretty sure there are some pious Muslim who think
*19:44.500- 19:49.400* :  women shouldn't show off like this, but mass, mass majority of Iranians are enjoying watching
*19:49.400- 19:52.840* :  such videos. Yeah, a goal of the BBC Persian service.
*19:55.720- 19:59.700* :  And still to come on the global news podcast. It's rare to find such a new,
*19:59.700- 20:03.720* :  complete skeleton, very the alongside humans. That's why we're thinking that maybe it was a
*20:03.720- 20:09.280* :  companion to some of the individuals of the community. No, not a dog, but which other animal could
*20:09.280- 20:10.940* :  have been man's best friend?
*20:20.300- 20:26.360* :  The UN Nuclear Watchdog, the IAEA, will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss a series
*20:26.360- 20:31.060* :  of drone attacks on the Russian occupied Zaporizha nuclear power plant in Ukraine.
*20:31.060- 20:36.480* :  Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of targeting Europe's biggest nuclear plant,
*20:36.480- 20:40.560* :  both denied doing so. From Vienna, where the IAEA is based,
*20:40.560- 20:46.420* :  here's our correspondent, Bethany Bell. The IAEA, which has a small team at Zaporizha,
*20:46.640- 20:52.760* :  said drones hit a reactor building three times on Sunday, endangering nuclear safety.
*20:53.640- 20:58.000* :  The Kremlin has said the strikes were carried out by Ukraine and were very dangerous.
*20:58.220- 21:04.760* :  Kiev has denied being behind the attacks. It said any incidents were staged by Moscow.
*21:05.560- 21:10.200* :  The IAEA hasn't blamed either Russia or Ukraine for the drone strikes.
*21:11.240- 21:16.800* :  But its director General Rafael Grossi said the attacks were reckless and must stop.
*21:17.660- 21:23.820* :  Whoever is behind them, he said, was playing with fire. He said attacking a nuclear power plant
*21:23.820- 21:31.460* :  was extremely irresponsible and dangerous. Bethany Bell. A US-owned boarding school in Jamaica
*21:31.460- 21:36.200* :  is in the spotlight after four employees were arrested and charged with child abuse.
*21:36.940- 21:42.220* :  In February 8, American boys were removed from the Atlantis leadership academy after abuse
*21:42.220- 21:48.200* :  claims came to light during an unannounced welfare check. It's founder and director Randall Cook,
*21:48.200- 21:54.700* :  who was not arrested, told NBC News in a statement that ALA is appalled at the hatchet job
*21:54.700- 21:59.580* :  that's being done to our reputation and deny all the allegations that have been coming at us
*21:59.980- 22:05.600* :  after over eight years in operation. The academy is part of a network of boarding schools,
*22:05.600- 22:10.220* :  camps and branches marketed at reforming teenagers with behavioral issues.
*22:10.820- 22:14.760* :  James Reynolds got the latest on the investigation from Tyler King Cade,
*22:14.760- 22:20.780* :  an LA-based reporter for NBC. There's two. There's one from the local law enforcement,
*22:20.780- 22:27.380* :  and there's one from the child welfare officials. CPFSA is the agency down there. They did a
*22:27.380- 22:32.720* :  welfare check on the boys back in February and immediately noticed what they have described
*22:32.720- 22:38.820* :  as signs of abuse and possible neglect and took the boys into protective custody.
*22:39.380- 22:43.900* :  One was immediately released back to the United States because he was already 18.
*22:43.900- 22:50.040* :  Two more have since been clear to be released, and Jamaica still has another handful of boys
*22:50.040- 22:53.820* :  down there as they go through the process to return them back to the United States.
*22:54.360- 23:00.420* :  The investigation at this point is still ongoing. What we know currently is that the boys have a
*23:00.420- 23:05.060* :  ledge that they were physically beaten. There's others information that we're still working to
*23:05.060- 23:09.940* :  confirm, but it's a very dire situation while we're hearing from parents as well as that
*23:09.940- 23:14.680* :  they often did not have a lot of communication with the boys while they were down there in Jamaica.
*23:15.240- 23:19.860* :  Tell us more about these schools, how they began, how prevalent they are in different countries.
*23:20.160- 23:24.940* :  These schools in the United States at least have been around for half century at this point.
*23:24.940- 23:31.920* :  There's one from very hard-line religious groups that created reform schools back in the 50s and
*23:31.920- 23:37.600* :  60s that still have, you can trace a lineage to some of the facilities in operation today
*23:37.660- 23:44.620* :  that claim religious exemptions to avoid some state laws that would otherwise govern the youth
*23:44.620- 23:50.200* :  facilities. Then there's some others that go back to a drug rehab program that was known as
*23:50.200- 23:56.240* :  Sinanon that dissolved. It started in the 50s, 60s and out here in California. Today it's
*23:56.240- 24:00.260* :  much more professionalized in many places. There's a whole range of them. They range from
*24:00.260- 24:07.280* :  boot camps to ranches, to treatment centers, to boarding schools, but the commonality is that
*24:07.300- 24:13.420* :  none of them are typically subject to any sort of federal regulation and then our states have
*24:13.420- 24:20.120* :  very different laws around the country for how in-depth local officials will be in investigating
*24:20.120- 24:25.600* :  or checking in on the welfare of the children. A lot of times we don't really hear about problems
*24:25.600- 24:30.360* :  going on until the children are out in back home and then they speak out once they're adults
*24:30.360- 24:35.120* :  and that's what's been going on in the past couple of years. Tyler Kinkay talking to James Reynolds.
*24:35.840- 24:41.180* :  As Paris skiers up to host this summer's Olympics, there are worrying reports for those competitors
*24:41.180- 24:46.940* :  hoping to take part in the triathlon, para triathlon, and swimming marathon. All those events are
*24:46.960- 24:51.720* :  supposed to take place in the riversend in the heart of the French capital, but there are fears it
*24:51.720- 24:57.720* :  may not be clean enough after a series of tests showed alarming levels of E. coli bacteria in
*24:57.720- 25:04.760* :  the water. Our correspondent Hugh Schofield has the details. That's President Macron a couple
*25:04.760- 25:09.680* :  of weeks ago announcing that he'll personally be bathing in the riversend once preparations for
*25:09.680- 25:15.380* :  the Olympics are complete. But is he, are all the Olympics organizers being over-optimistic?
*25:15.380- 25:21.380* :  An environmental NGO surf rider has just reported findings that suggest the riversend is still
*25:21.380- 25:29.320* :  not as clean as had been hoped. Project manager Lucy Segala. Since September 2023, we've
*25:29.320- 25:34.680* :  taken 14 samples, including 12 for which we've obtained levels above the threshold recommended
*25:34.680- 25:40.240* :  by the Ministry of Health website. And we also have 13 samples that are above the thresholds
*25:40.240- 25:46.380* :  recommended by the international swimming and triathlon federation. Here on the banks of the
*25:46.380- 25:51.180* :  Sand, it's impossible without taking samples and testing them in a laboratory to assess the
*25:51.180- 25:56.380* :  quality of the water. All that we can say for sure is that there has been a remarkable improvement
*25:56.380- 26:02.540* :  going back more than 20 years now, thanks mainly to investment in sanitation upstream. But with
*26:02.540- 26:06.340* :  the Olympics approaching, the task has been to push the quality up to an even higher level
*26:06.700- 26:11.660* :  so that swimming can be permitted for the public, that's supposed to be one of the legacies of the
*26:12.080- 26:16.760* :  Games. One way they've been trying to do that is by stopping the many barges and pleasure boats
*26:17.160- 26:22.320* :  that are moored along the river here from dumping their wastewater into the river. Pierre-Mocky
*26:22.320- 26:28.020* :  owns and lives on one of the barges. Well, by the way, we haven't been allowed for a very long time
*26:28.020- 26:33.240* :  to dump black water or gray water into the sand. It's true that with the Olympic Games, there is
*26:33.240- 26:38.760* :  a mobilization to regularize the situation for boats. But for us, in any case, it was very logical
*26:38.760- 26:42.460* :  and very necessary to send our wastewater to more other than the same.
*26:43.820- 26:49.360* :  There's also been millions invested in a vast underground reservoir near the Osterlit station.
*26:49.360- 26:55.280* :  This is intended to hold runoff from the city's drains when there's heavy rainfall and stop it
*26:55.320- 27:01.320* :  going into the sand. The Olympics organizers point out that this wasn't in operation when the NGO
*27:01.320- 27:07.700* :  took its water readings and they also say that winter water quality is not the same as summer
*27:07.700- 27:13.480* :  water quality, which is obviously what counts. Pierre-Rabadon is the Paris deputy mayor in charge
*27:13.480- 27:20.660* :  of the Olympics. Winter is not our goal and that's why the results released by surfrider don't correspond
*27:20.660- 27:26.420* :  to our objectives. Talent taught us anything. We knew that at the time the water quality was not
*27:26.420- 27:32.640* :  yet satisfactory for bathing and that's not our priority objective. Our objective is the summer.
*27:35.600- 27:41.840* :  That report from Paris by Hugh Skurfield. Inclusivity is an important value for many sports brands.
*27:41.880- 27:46.460* :  You may have seen adverts for sportswear or shoes with models who are amputees.
*27:46.960- 27:49.840* :  Some shops now even have mannequins wearing running blades.
*27:50.540- 27:55.020* :  Paralympian Steph Reed who has only one foot was excited by this development,
*27:55.020- 27:58.320* :  but also had questions for the firm behind it.
*27:58.840- 28:03.280* :  Dear Nike, is it possible to buy just one shoe because I only have one foot?
*28:04.160- 28:09.140* :  Two friends recently sent me photos of mannequins in Nike stores with running blades and I thought
*28:09.140- 28:14.240* :  this was awesome! But then I asked Nike the obvious question. You can pause to read the full
*28:14.240- 28:19.120* :  conversation but here are the highlights. The answer was no. They offered a one-time 10% discount
*28:19.120- 28:24.120* :  which I said was very kind, but next time I buy running shoes I'm still only going to have one
*28:24.120- 28:29.180* :  foot so it's not really a solution. Steph Reed's video has been viewed millions of times
*28:29.180- 28:35.300* :  on TikTok and Instagram. She says other brands like the Kaplan and Brooks also feature amputee
*28:35.300- 28:38.920* :  models in their campaigns. She's been talking about the issue to the BBC.
*28:39.480- 28:44.520* :  I lost part of my leg in a boating accident when I was a teenager and I think my goodness to have
*28:44.520- 28:50.960* :  seen that image in a major sports brand would have been amazing. So definitely I love the mannequins
*28:50.960- 28:55.920* :  are there but it was just that case of you're not offering the one thing that a blade runner would
*28:55.920- 29:01.100* :  actually need and it's the option to buy one shoe. My biggest hope is that this just sparks a
*29:01.100- 29:06.140* :  discussion about inclusion and diversity and what it actually looks like in the real world.
*29:06.560- 29:10.640* :  I think look if you're going to portray this image and of course I can completely understand why
*29:10.640- 29:16.560* :  brands want to portray themselves as inclusive and diverse then you need to back it up with your
*29:16.560- 29:22.460* :  policies but I should also say as a single amputee I don't have an expectation that a company should
*29:22.960- 29:28.540* :  have to accommodate me at a financial loss. I think this is a perfect example of where inclusive
*29:28.540- 29:33.980* :  and diverse thinking makes you more competitive as a business. It brought to light for me I
*29:33.980- 29:39.160* :  were contacts and never in my life have I ever bought contacts as a pair because of zero assumption
*29:39.160- 29:43.860* :  that both eyes need the same prescription. Actually it's not just amputees or disability,
*29:43.860- 29:50.420* :  a quick Google search has said that 50 to 60% of adults actually have feet that don't match and
*29:50.420- 29:55.700* :  so for me if you're selling a high performance shoe and you have put all the research in why not
*29:55.700- 30:00.980* :  take that extra step of let's make sure both feet have an amazing fit. Paralympian,
*30:00.980- 30:07.520* :  Steph Reed and so far she hasn't heard back from the company. Finally long before dogs were
*30:07.520- 30:12.800* :  officially known as man's best friend another canine seems to have found its way into our
*30:12.800- 30:19.180* :  affections. Scientists were surprised to find a fox buried in a human grave one and a half thousand
*30:19.180- 30:25.580* :  years old in Argentina. Dr. Opheli Labrasa from the University of Oxford spoke to James Menendez.
*30:25.920- 30:30.620* :  So essentially it was like canine remains that was found at the site of Kenya da Seca so it's a
*30:30.620- 30:36.400* :  human burial site in North Western Patagonia which we dated to about 1500 years ago. We recovered
*30:36.400- 30:41.840* :  at least 21 human individuals and there was this partially mounted canine skeleton that we
*30:41.840- 30:48.420* :  identified as the extinct fox species decisionavis. So it was a canine species what so from the dog
*30:48.420- 30:55.040* :  family but this was an extinct fox just tell us a bit more about the species. There's not too much
*30:55.040- 30:59.960* :  we know about it in terms of reconstruction based on the bones we think it was about medium size
*31:00.040- 31:05.960* :  so similar to a coyote and it would have weighed maybe about 10 to 15 kilograms but it went extinct
*31:05.960- 31:10.240* :  about 500 years ago. And could it have been the type of dog I mean how do you know that it was a
*31:10.240- 31:15.640* :  a type of fox what are the characteristics that you identified. So I think for us in this particular
*31:16.120- 31:20.380* :  case we're looking at one specific specimen and first of all we're looking at the morphological
*31:20.380- 31:25.140* :  features using comparative material to make sure that the species identification was correct and
*31:25.140- 31:30.600* :  we also use genetic data although it was relatively poorly preserved but we were able to use some
*31:30.600- 31:35.500* :  of the fragments of the DNA to confirm the species was a decisionavis. Yeah I was just going to
*31:35.500- 31:40.420* :  say because this was excavated what about 1991. So how surprised when you realized that actually
*31:40.420- 31:45.300* :  this was something slightly different. Originally it was it had been identified as a lecalopex which is
*31:45.300- 31:51.720* :  another South American fox species but then my colleague did some dietary analysis and realized that
*31:51.720- 31:56.840* :  the diet of the animal was very similar to the one of the human that were buried and we started
*31:56.840- 32:00.900* :  like question whether the species identification had been correct could it have been a dog or could
*32:00.900- 32:05.540* :  it have been something else and that's when we re-evaluated the specimen and found that it was
*32:05.600- 32:11.340* :  indeed a decisionavis which was surprising not only for the similarity in the diet but also because
*32:11.340- 32:16.520* :  we didn't think the species lived in this particular region in the past. Okay and the fact that
*32:16.520- 32:22.340* :  it was eating the same sort of food as the humans that it was buried with what does that tell you.
*32:22.520- 32:26.580* :  Because essentially the decisionavis is quite a carnivorous animal and compared to other South
*32:26.580- 32:32.000* :  American canis as well. The diet of our particular specimen moved away from the diet that those
*32:32.000- 32:36.980* :  canis were that eaten and resemble more of that of the human which would suggest that either it was
*32:36.980- 32:42.220* :  probably well integrated within the hunter-gatherer society maybe it was directly fed maybe it fed
*32:42.220- 32:46.940* :  on the west and the refuse but the combination of the diet but also it's burial within this human
*32:46.940- 32:51.520* :  burial site would suggest that there was some kind of close bond between this individual and the
*32:51.520- 32:56.140* :  hunter-gatherer society. Yes I was going to say but the fact that it was buried with humans means that it
*32:56.140- 33:02.460* :  must have had value to those humans is that fair. Exactly yes. In general South American canis are
*33:02.460- 33:07.140* :  quite symbolic in hunter-gatherer societies so it could have had an economic or symbolic significance
*33:07.140- 33:12.560* :  but it's rare to find such a near-complete skeleton buried alongside humans but for us
*33:12.840- 33:16.540* :  combines with diet it must have been more than just a symbol that's why we're thinking that maybe
*33:16.540- 33:21.760* :  it was a companion to some of the individuals of the community. Dr. Opheli LeBrasseur from the
