*01:27.960- 01:32.960* :  I'm Paul Moss and in the early hours of Friday the 19th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:33.720- 01:38.500* :  Kenya's defense chief and nine other military personnel have died in a helicopter crash.
*01:38.500- 01:41.940* :  The president William Ruto announced three days of mourning.
*01:48.100- 01:53.100* :  A bid by Palestine to gain full membership of the United Nations has been blocked by the US.
*01:53.900- 01:57.680* :  And we hear how a growing population means Chinese cities are suffering
*01:57.680- 02:03.960* :  subsidence with water extraction, the culprit. This is not just a few local places that are thinking.
*02:03.960- 02:08.780* :  It's something that's affecting a lot of people. There's a lot of commonalities and there
*02:08.780- 02:15.520* :  probably needs to be a national response. Also in this podcast, we have a disproportionate
*02:15.520- 02:20.160* :  burden of intimate partner violence. We also see higher rates of femicide, which is the
*02:20.160- 02:26.800* :  murder of a woman by her partner or a former partner. New research reveals high levels of domestic
*02:26.800- 02:33.440* :  violence in the US state of Louisiana. And white UNESCO's famous world heritage sites are at the
*02:33.440- 02:37.040* :  center of controversy over the treatment of indigenous peoples.
*02:41.080- 02:45.540* :  Flags are flying at half mass throughout Kenya. Three days of mourning having been declared
*02:46.100- 02:50.560* :  after the head of the armed forces was killed in a helicopter crash. Nine other military
*02:50.560- 02:56.580* :  figures also died. General Francis Agala had only been in the post for a year. He was himself
*02:56.580- 03:02.540* :  a fighter pilot. Kenya's president William Ruto expressed his personal sadness at the disaster.
*03:03.200- 03:10.740* :  Our motherland has lost one of her most valiant generals. We have also lost gallant officers.
*03:11.660- 03:19.260* :  The sorrow we all feel about this passing on is shared by all of the people of Kenya.
*03:19.980- 03:25.200* :  Only two people survived the crash in Elgeo Marraquette County, some 400 kilometers
*03:25.200- 03:30.180* :  northwest of the capital Nairobi. An investigation has been launched with details of the crash
*03:30.180- 03:36.560* :  still coming in. But our deputy-Africa editor Ann Soi in Nairobi told Valerie Sarnason what's
*03:36.560- 03:42.480* :  known so far. We understand that they general and the other military officers will perish
*03:42.480- 03:47.740* :  alongside him. We're on a military mission in the area. It's the north-west of the country.
*03:47.740- 03:52.420* :  A place that has been played by insecurity because of cattle rustling and banditry.
*03:52.860- 03:59.260* :  And they had been surveying the area and also going to schools that the military is helping
*03:59.260- 04:06.400* :  to renovate after they were attacked by the suspected bandits. And when the helicopter was
*04:06.400- 04:11.460* :  taking off from one of the schools, we understand that it came down and burst into flames.
*04:12.060- 04:17.900* :  Killing now it has been confirmed. Ten people who include their general and their work to
*04:17.900- 04:22.580* :  survive us were now in hospital. And what can you tell us about general Francis Egola?
*04:23.280- 04:27.480* :  Well, he has had a long career in the military 39 years and he was appointed
*04:27.480- 04:34.340* :  barely a year ago last April by President Ruto to that role. And the President has spoken
*04:34.340- 04:39.560* :  this evening, confirming that crash and saying that he's deeply saddened personally
*04:39.560- 04:45.520* :  and calling it a tragic loss for the military and for the country. The flags we fly at half-must
*04:45.520- 04:53.940* :  for three days in honor of the fallen general. And we understand that there are survivors who
*04:53.940- 04:57.680* :  may be able to tell everyone more about what exactly happened.
*04:58.420- 05:02.880* :  We understand there were survivors. They have been evacuated. The President confirmed
*05:02.880- 05:09.160* :  that they are now in hospital. He called this crash an accident but said that the air force,
*05:09.820- 05:16.520* :  the formation from which the general came from came. He will conduct investigations to a certain
*05:17.020- 05:23.120* :  the cause of the crash. We understand that the unit has already been deployed to the scene of the
*05:23.120- 05:28.620* :  crash which has been cordoned off to carry out the investigation. And what's been
*05:28.620- 05:34.220* :  reaction in Kenya to this? There were rumors circulating throughout the day. This is a very
*05:34.220- 05:40.700* :  remote area in the country and where it had not been confirmed. There were fears that the general,
*05:40.700- 05:48.640* :  the senior most military officer was on board that infated plane. And so it has been confirmed
*05:48.640- 05:54.320* :  this evening and people are in shock really. Wondering how this could have happened especially
*05:54.320- 06:01.680* :  when you have the senior most military general as well as other senior officers of the military as
*06:01.680- 06:06.360* :  well. So many questions will be asked. People will be waiting for the outcome of that investigation.
*06:06.900- 06:13.940* :  Our Deputy Africa Editor and Soy in Nairobi. The result was never really end out. The Palestinian
*06:13.940- 06:19.900* :  delegation made a bid to gain full membership of the United Nations and the United States vetoed it.
*06:20.340- 06:25.380* :  Palestine has had observer status since 2012 but isn't able to vote in proceedings.
*06:26.140- 06:30.920* :  And that restriction will now remain as announced by the current president of the UN Security
*06:30.920- 06:38.140* :  Council, Vanessa Frazier. The result of the vote is as follows. 12 votes in favour.
*06:39.040- 06:46.040* :  One vote against two abstentions. The draft resolution has not been adopted owing to the negative
*06:46.040- 06:51.420* :  vote of a permanent member of the council. So the US had its way with our veto.
*06:52.300- 06:57.620* :  But in fact it was hoping to avoid the entire process. There's an North America correspondent John
*06:57.620- 07:03.640* :  Sudworth explained. There's been clearly heavy lobbying behind the scenes from the US that did not
*07:03.640- 07:08.300* :  want this to come to a vote. It did not want to be forced to use its veto. But it had signaled
*07:08.300- 07:12.740* :  in advance that were that vote to be brought. It would have no choice but to vote against.
*07:13.640- 07:18.300* :  This was almost never going to get across the line today. The United States position is that
*07:18.300- 07:25.160* :  while it supports steps towards a two-state solution, it felt that granting Palestine
*07:26.300- 07:31.680* :  full-state membership here at the United Nations would be premature that that move should be
*07:31.680- 07:40.740* :  predicated on negotiations and a bilateral agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
*07:40.740- 07:46.280* :  It felt it would be unhelpful. You know, the arguments were rehearsed during the discussions
*07:46.280- 07:54.300* :  today. We heard from the Palestinian representative saying that although there was recognition that
*07:54.300- 07:58.620* :  this in itself wouldn't change the facts on the ground, it would bring hope to Palestinian people.
*07:59.000- 08:04.300* :  But we also heard from the Israeli ambassador saying that six months on after the Hamas attacks,
*08:04.800- 08:11.240* :  this would simply be a reward for terror. It's symbolic, I think, because a lot of people even
*08:11.240- 08:15.780* :  knowing that this was going to fail still seemed intent to bring it to a vote.
*08:16.500- 08:22.000* :  John Sudworth in New York. As that debate on the vote was being held, Thursday saw Israel drop
*08:22.000- 08:27.380* :  dozens more bombs on Gaza. This just a day after a barrage of strikes hit the center of the
*08:27.380- 08:33.880* :  strip, as well as sights in the north. The Hamas-run health ministry says nearly 34,000 people have been
*08:33.880- 08:40.180* :  killed since the conflict began. That includes at least 70 in the last 24 hours. The attacks by
*08:40.180- 08:46.560* :  Hamas on October 7th and Israel's response have sparked global street protests. And the fallout
*08:46.560- 08:52.760* :  now appears to be spreading to the corporate sector. On Thursday, Google confirmed that 28 of
*08:52.760- 08:58.420* :  its staff have been sacked after they demonstrated against a contract which the tech giant has with
*08:58.420- 09:03.700* :  the Israeli government. A business correspondent Jonathan Joseph shared more details with Valerie
*09:03.700- 09:10.520* :  Sanderson. They save a $1.2 billion contract that the Israeli government has jointly with Google
*09:10.520- 09:16.220* :  and Amazon and it's to provide a range of cloud and artificial intelligence computing services
*09:16.620- 09:20.680* :  to the Israeli government right across the administration. Israel's a country where it's
*09:20.860- 09:25.640* :  notoriously difficult to get any paperwork done if you're a citizen. So in the health care and
*09:25.640- 09:30.520* :  the education sectors, those are sort of places where it could be used. But the protesters here
*09:30.520- 09:36.340* :  concerned that it's being used in the military sphere as well and in particular to target Palestinians
*09:36.340- 09:43.980* :  in Gaza. And Google has sacked them. What did they say? So Google have said that the protesters'
*09:43.980- 09:49.520* :  behavior was completely unacceptable that these protesters in their New York and Sunnyvale,
*09:49.520- 09:54.720* :  California offices were disrupting other colleagues, stopping them from being able to do their work
*09:54.720- 10:00.120* :  and that this couldn't happen. And in a statement, they said that the contract is not directed at
*10:00.120- 10:05.400* :  highly sensitive, classified or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.
*10:05.800- 10:10.080* :  So they're trying to keep their distance from this idea that there are military applications
*10:10.080- 10:15.900* :  of this technology. It's also worth pointing out what Google said to some of their own staffers
*10:16.200- 10:20.740* :  in a memo to them. They said that this is a place of business where every Googler is expected
*10:20.740- 10:25.880* :  to read our policies and apply them about how they conduct themselves and communicating our workplace.
*10:25.880- 10:31.460* :  And the overwhelming majority of employees do the right thing. And they said that if you're one
*10:31.460- 10:35.800* :  of the few who are tempted to think we're going to overlook conduct that violates our policies,
*10:35.800- 10:40.760* :  think again. So they're pretty clear that this was not acceptable within the contract that these
*10:40.760- 10:45.440* :  staff has had. And what about these 28 people? Are they going to take it further? These have been
*10:45.440- 10:50.480* :  long running concerns amongst Google staff. This isn't the first time they've protested like this.
*10:50.860- 10:55.060* :  But now these 28 people have lost their job. They have said in a post on social media that they
*10:55.060- 11:00.160* :  intend to continue making the case against Google having this contract with the Israeli government.
*11:00.160- 11:03.620* :  So they're the likely adult. This isn't the last we've heard of it.
*11:04.080- 11:10.640* :  Jonathan Joseph's. It represents an extraordinary movement of people. Half a century ago,
*11:10.640- 11:16.280* :  China was a predominantly rural country. But since then, the number of people living in cities has
*11:16.280- 11:22.680* :  multiplied six times. There are now 900 million of these urban dwellers. And that perhaps not
*11:22.680- 11:27.600* :  surprisingly is having a major impact on the physical environment. A new satellite assessment
*11:27.600- 11:33.700* :  suggests that half the land under major cities is undergoing subsidence caused by human activity.
*11:33.700- 11:38.700* :  Robert Nichols is a professor of climate adaptation at the University of East Anglia in England.
*11:39.400- 11:43.220* :  He says one of the main problems is all the water that's been extracted.
*11:44.100- 11:49.400* :  When there's a lot of people living on delters, areas that have been sedimented fairly recently,
*11:49.400- 11:54.360* :  geologically speaking. And so when you take out groundwater or you drain the soils or whatever,
*11:54.360- 11:59.880* :  they tend to subside. This is not just a few local places that are thinking. It's something that's
*11:59.880- 12:04.200* :  affecting a lot of people. There's a lot of commonalities and there probably needs to be a
*12:04.200- 12:09.440* :  national response. Robert Nichols, more on this now from our environment correspondent, Matt McGrath.
*12:10.040- 12:14.580* :  According to the researchers here, the geology of China, the weight of the buildings, all those
*12:14.580- 12:19.600* :  make it contributing factor. But the big issue for them is the extraction and use of water
*12:20.020- 12:24.680* :  in local city areas. And that is effectively helping these cities sink at some of them at
*12:24.680- 12:29.280* :  quite a rapid pace. The scientists say that in some respects, it can be quite dangerous because
*12:29.280- 12:34.140* :  if different parts of cities are expanding or sinking at different rates, then you can get
*12:35.000- 12:39.920* :  buildings toppling over and falling down. They point to the example of Beijing, where you've got
*12:39.920- 12:45.440* :  because of the development of the metro, in some parts of the city, a subsidence is going at 45
*12:45.440- 12:49.880* :  millimeters a year. In other parts, it's not going so quickly because they're not using so much
*12:49.880- 12:53.620* :  water. There's been a ban on some of the water use there. So different cities have different
*12:53.620- 13:00.040* :  speeds of subsidence. And it's a change in speed that makes likelihood that buildings could collapse
*13:00.040- 13:04.040* :  in different parts of it. There's a great deal of concern about this. And China has been long
*13:04.040- 13:08.600* :  been aware of this problem in Shanghai as sank by three meters over the last 100 years. So they're
*13:08.600- 13:13.480* :  well aware of the issue. They may look at two other countries like Japan, where Tokyo and Osaka,
*13:13.920- 13:18.060* :  those cities were both sinking in the past. But measures were put in place in the 1970s,
*13:18.060- 13:23.460* :  essentially to stop people using local water and to bring water from other regions by pipe.
*13:23.920- 13:27.560* :  Chinese authorities may well be looking at those kind of measures to see if they can
*13:27.920- 13:31.200* :  put a stop to this very rapid sinking. Matt McGraw.
*13:32.420- 13:38.020* :  Every year, tens of thousands of tourists visit UNESCO's famous world heritage sites, many of them
*13:38.020- 13:43.860* :  treasured natural wildlife sanctuaries. But has this prestigious status come at a cost to the
*13:43.860- 13:48.640* :  people who live there? The campaign group Survival International has accused the UN Cultural
*13:48.640- 13:54.320* :  Organization of complicity in the forcible eviction and abuse of indigenous communities.
*13:54.380- 14:00.400* :  In a report to Mark World Heritage Day, it says that serious abuses are being committed in the name
*14:00.400- 14:06.580* :  of conservation at several sites in Africa and elsewhere. A Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton
*14:06.580- 14:13.720* :  reports. Survival International says it has uncovered cases of rape, torture and killings of
*14:13.720- 14:20.960* :  indigenous people in world heritage sites in Africa and Asia. These include the Engorangoro
*14:20.960- 14:27.680* :  Conservation Area in Tanzania, the Kahuzi-Biega National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*14:27.680- 14:35.020* :  and the Ojala Kokua National Park in neighboring Republic of Congo. The report says what are often
*14:35.020- 14:42.480* :  called natural world heritage sites are very often stolen ancestral lands, where indigenous owners
*14:42.480- 14:49.960* :  are kept out by force, intimidation and terror. It accuses the UN body of either turning a blind
*14:49.960- 14:57.460* :  eye to abuses or actively encouraging evictions. Fiori Longo is Survival International's campaign
*14:57.460- 15:03.260* :  manager. It's not possible in the world of today that we call world heritage sites, so something
*15:03.260- 15:09.120* :  that belong to the world to the humanity. We call in this way places where the best guardians of
*15:09.120- 15:14.580* :  the natural world are being killed, abused and raped. And when I say this and just it's really
*15:14.580- 15:20.200* :  concrete, it's not something generic. The Masai are losing their cows, they are being shot,
*15:20.300- 15:26.120* :  indigenous Batua in Kahuzi-Biega are being raped and their houses are being burned and their
*15:26.120- 15:32.200* :  children are being killed. So when we talk about places that are important to us as humanity,
*15:32.920- 15:37.320* :  we cannot tolerate that in these places human-righted atrocities are happening.
*15:37.800- 15:44.940* :  Fiori Longo also says it's ironic that the indigenous people are not allowed back onto their land
*15:44.940- 15:51.700* :  to bury their dead or perform ancient rituals, and yet every year thousands of tourists are
*15:51.700- 15:58.360* :  allowed into them. While the UN organization designates world heritage sites, the on-the-ground
*15:58.360- 16:04.560* :  activities in these areas are the responsibility of the authorities in the relevant countries.
*16:05.280- 16:11.640* :  UNESCO has issued a statement to the BBC strongly contesting the allegations in the report.
*16:11.740- 16:17.760* :  It says it has made respect for the rights of indigenous peoples a fundamental principle
*16:17.760- 16:23.860* :  in the management of world heritage sites. UNESCO goes on to say that there are more than
*16:23.860- 16:30.900* :  1000 such protected areas and yet the campaign group has collected testimonies from just six
*16:31.100- 16:38.780* :  hence casting shame on all of them. Richard Hamilton. It's known in the US as intimate partner
*16:38.780- 16:44.600* :  violence, the physical abuse which goes on in people's homes, and the state of Louisiana has now
*16:44.600- 16:50.700* :  assessed the scale of the problem and its economic cost. It found women were three times more likely
*16:50.700- 16:57.680* :  to be the victims, that in 2022 alone it led to $10 billion being spent on medical bills,
*16:57.680- 17:03.400* :  the criminal justice system, as well as lost productivity. Anita Raj is co-author of the report,
*17:03.420- 17:10.060* :  a professor of public health at Tulane University. She told Victoria O'Anhunda the results were
*17:10.060- 17:15.560* :  certainly not what they'd expected. We were staggered by the findings. It seems to be higher here
*17:15.560- 17:20.720* :  than we're seeing in other states. About half of all women have experienced intimate partner
*17:20.720- 17:26.200* :  violence and about 200,000 women have experienced it in the past year. We did a costing analysis,
*17:26.520- 17:30.760* :  where we considered the healthcare cost, the cost of the criminal justice system,
*17:31.080- 17:37.920* :  the cost of labor lost, overall the cost to our state are $10.1 billion, which is about 3.5%
*17:37.920- 17:44.000* :  of our GDP. So it's a staggering amount that it's costing our state. You mentioned that the figures
*17:44.000- 17:49.960* :  that you found were higher in the Louisiana state than any other state. How much higher? We
*17:49.960- 17:54.800* :  actually only have two states that we can do the comparison with at this time. The state that
*17:54.800- 18:01.580* :  we compare it to is California. It's about 20 to 30% higher here, and we also could see from the
*18:01.580- 18:08.940* :  crime data, which allows us to look at data across all states, that 22% of violent criminal offenders
*18:08.940- 18:13.440* :  in our prison system are in there because of intimate partner violence, whereas for the country
*18:13.440- 18:18.920* :  as a whole, it's 17%. So we know we have a disproportionate burden of not just violent crimes,
*18:18.920- 18:24.860* :  but intimate partner violence. We also see higher rates of homicide, which is the murder of a
*18:24.860- 18:31.540* :  woman by her partner or a former partner. How do you want the state of Louisiana to tackle
*18:31.540- 18:38.540* :  this issue? The cost of inaction is clearly high here. So we have to wonder what could be done
*18:38.540- 18:44.360* :  if you invested in violence prevention programs, domestic violence services. This is really
*18:44.360- 18:49.100* :  important for everywhere. And many governments simply don't invest in violence prevention, which
*18:49.100- 18:55.620* :  over time would defray the heavy cost and mental health and physical health toll. It's taking on
*18:55.620- 19:01.640* :  women, families, children in particular are affected as well. What do you think the issue of
*19:01.660- 19:07.640* :  intimate partner violence isn't really looked into? I think there's a couple of things. So the
*19:07.640- 19:13.400* :  Louisiana is like a low-income state within the context of the United States. In a lot of low and
*19:13.400- 19:17.940* :  middle-income environments, we know that there are enormous stressors, but there are also very
*19:17.940- 19:24.020* :  traditional norms that are maintained. That includes sort of an acceptability that partner violence,
*19:24.020- 19:30.200* :  something that happens in households. It's their business. It's not viewed in the same light as
*19:30.200- 19:35.560* :  other forms of violence in terms of it being a crime. In Louisiana, we know that even when people
*19:35.560- 19:40.860* :  come forward with domestic violence complaints to the criminal justice system, oftentimes that doesn't
*19:40.860- 19:45.740* :  result in a conviction, and it could even increase the person's risk for more violence at home.
*19:45.780- 19:51.080* :  And that's not unique to Louisiana. We see that in every country. And again, people have kind of
*19:51.080- 19:56.040* :  viewed it as something that's just normal and it happens, and it's not our business. It's their
*19:56.040- 20:02.060* :  personal business. Professor Anita Raj from Tulane University, speaking to Victoria Wanhunda.
*20:04.720- 20:08.920* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast. It's just a pleasure to be able to work on a
*20:08.920- 20:14.420* :  cathedral and nowadays, like they did almost thousand years ago. You got a sensation of the energy
*20:14.420- 20:19.660* :  that's been given to this building. So it's very hard to leave this aside. We meet the Argentinian
*20:19.660- 20:27.220* :  carpenter helping to restore Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Returning now to the Middle East,
*20:27.220- 20:33.180* :  the US and Britain have announced new sanctions on Iran. This, of course, in response to last weekend's
*20:33.180- 20:38.820* :  drone and missile attack on Israel. More individuals, companies and military organisations have
*20:38.820- 20:44.880* :  been added to an existing list of Iranians. They face travel bans and asset freezes. The conflict
*20:44.880- 20:50.100* :  was top of the agenda at a meeting of foreign ministers from the G7 group of leading economies,
*20:50.100- 20:55.160* :  as well as the war in Ukraine. That meeting was held on the Italian island of Capri,
*20:55.160- 20:58.100* :  from where our correspondent Jessica Parker reports.
*20:58.780- 21:04.200* :  Plans for fresh sanctions against Iran had been heavily advertised in advance. As G7 foreign
*21:04.200- 21:10.460* :  ministers met, the UK and the US announced they'd be targeting people and organisations linked to
*21:10.460- 21:16.560* :  Iran's drone and missile programme. The EU's also promised further restrictive measures. These
*21:16.560- 21:22.420* :  moves follow Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israel itself a response to a strike on an Iranian
*21:22.420- 21:27.540* :  consulate in Syria. Britain's foreign secretary, Lord Cameron, spoke from the G7 meeting
*21:27.540- 21:33.220* :  on the island of Capri. Iran's behaviour is unacceptable and it's right that countries come
*21:33.220- 21:39.220* :  together here at the G7 and make those points, not just because of what Iran has been doing,
*21:39.220- 21:46.340* :  but also as a message to Israel that we want to play our part in having a coordinated strategy
*21:46.340- 21:51.900* :  that deals with Iran's aggression, that we saw so clearly against Israel over the weekend.
*21:52.140- 21:57.160* :  The other central issue being discussed here is support for Ukraine. One idea is whether interest
*21:57.160- 22:04.000* :  accrued on frozen Russian assets could be used to help finance Kiev. Ukraine's pleas for further
*22:04.000- 22:09.640* :  air defence systems are being loudly echoed, what's less clear is when and how they'll be answered.
*22:09.640- 22:14.540* :  The Secretary-General of the NATO Military Alliance, Ian Stoltenberg, who's here in Capri,
*22:14.540- 22:19.500* :  said conversations with partners were ongoing, while warning that Russia was pushing along the
*22:19.500- 22:26.500* :  whole front line alongside waves of air strikes. Jessica Parker, they're still just beginning the
*22:26.500- 22:31.760* :  process of clearing up the mess and destruction left by flooding in the United Arab Emirates.
*22:32.120- 22:37.080* :  The immediate cause was clear, the heaviest rainfall to hit the Gulf region since records began.
*22:37.180- 22:42.760* :  As we reported in an earlier global news podcast, many thousands of passengers have been left
*22:42.760- 22:48.600* :  stranded at Dubai's main airport, while enabling a man 20 people have been killed by the floodwaters.
*22:49.320- 22:54.080* :  And there are also reports that Yemen has suffered severe damage to infrastructure and property.
*22:54.760- 22:58.280* :  Floodings also devastated parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan,
*22:58.880- 23:01.860* :  as our correspondent in Islamabad Caroline Davis describes.
*23:02.740- 23:07.020* :  Shurning muddy waters surging through Farral province in Western Afghanistan,
*23:07.720- 23:11.880* :  heavy rains have battered the country. At least 70 people have been killed,
*23:11.880- 23:18.780* :  thousands of homes damaged and farmland deluged. And this is the sound of flash flooding in
*23:18.780- 23:24.860* :  Pakistan's mountains in the north. Some main roads here are already blocked,
*23:24.860- 23:31.060* :  with mudslides, heavy rocks and debris falling down steep slopes, villages are cut off.
*23:31.680- 23:37.460* :  In the south, Baluchistan's coastal cities have also seen flooding. There have been deaths here too.
*23:37.460- 23:42.780* :  In KP province, one family lost four members, including a nine-month-old baby,
*23:42.780- 23:48.240* :  when their roof collapsed under the weight of the water. According to Pakistan's official figures,
*23:48.240- 23:54.860* :  28 people among the 76 dead were struck by lightning. Both countries have seen a dry few months,
*23:54.860- 24:01.100* :  followed quickly by heavy rain. Rainfall is not unusual at this time of year, but it's the level
*24:01.100- 24:06.340* :  and variability that worries climate scientists. A spokesperson from Pakistan's
*24:06.340- 24:11.800* :  metrological department said that it had been 99% higher than average across the country.
*24:12.600- 24:16.320* :  The worst of the weather is not over. There are warnings of landslides,
*24:16.320- 24:19.820* :  flash flooding and glacial lake outbursts in the coming days.
*24:20.320- 24:26.180* :  Caroline Davies in Islamabad. Now to a story rather close to home, the head of the BBC World
*24:26.180- 24:31.860* :  Service has announced she'll step down from the role in July. And she's not exactly going quietly.
*24:31.860- 24:38.300* :  In an email to staff, Lillian Landour made explicitly clear she's deeply concerned about further
*24:38.300- 24:42.380* :  cuts facing the service. Our media correspondent David Silito reports.
*24:43.400- 24:48.300* :  It was less than three years ago that Lillian Landour returned to the BBC from Channel 4 to take
*24:48.300- 24:54.460* :  over the running of the World Service. Within 12 months she had to announce 382 jobs were going,
*24:54.460- 24:58.240* :  and the Arabic and Persian radio services were to be closed down.
*24:58.940- 25:03.020* :  In the past it was the British government, the foreign office that paid for the World Service,
*25:03.020- 25:08.500* :  but over the last 10 years that cost has been largely passed on to the BBC. Around three quarters
*25:08.500- 25:14.960* :  of the $470 million budget now comes out of the licence fee. And with the BBC's real income
*25:14.960- 25:19.400* :  dropping by around a third over those years, the World Service has come under pressure.
*25:19.840- 25:24.980* :  In a statement, Lillian Landour says she's deeply concerned about the operational capacity of the
*25:24.980- 25:30.720* :  World Service, if additional cuts continue to weaken it further. It was only three weeks ago that
*25:30.720- 25:36.760* :  the BBC's Director General Tim Davies said an extra $250 million of savings were needed.
*25:36.760- 25:41.500* :  The British government says it has made an extra $25 million payment towards the
*25:41.500- 25:47.500* :  World Service language services and has begun a review of the way the BBC overall will be funded
*25:47.500- 25:54.120* :  in the future. David Silito. It's four months since beach walkers in Sydney and elsewhere in
*25:54.120- 26:00.500* :  Australia began noticing a rather unusual cargo washing ashore, bricks containing cocaine.
*26:00.620- 26:05.220* :  It seemed clear to police this was some kind of smuggling operation gone awry.
*26:05.680- 26:11.160* :  And now the mystery could be over. Detectives there have arrested a man, a key member they claim
*26:11.160- 26:18.640* :  of a trafficking network with more details. Here's Sean Wales. This 36 year old man from Brisbane
*26:18.640- 26:23.980* :  has been arrested believed to be the leader of a crime group with international links.
*26:24.380- 26:29.640* :  It's alleged the group has brought two tons of cocaine into Australia in the past year.
*26:29.640- 26:36.680* :  That's a street value of around $400 million US dollars. But one attempt in November to import
*26:36.680- 26:42.400* :  900 kilograms of cocaine by sea failed spectacularly for the criminal organisation.
*26:42.400- 26:47.120* :  Police say the group wasn't able to collect the drugs off the Queensland coast,
*26:47.600- 26:51.460* :  and police have since been searching for the drugs but couldn't find them anywhere.
*26:52.080- 26:55.640* :  But then they started appearing all of a sudden since December,
*26:55.640- 27:00.260* :  bricks of cocaine have been washing up on beaches along the New South Wales coast
*27:00.260- 27:07.800* :  from Newcastle down to Sydney. 256 kilograms of so far been found. Take a listen to Detective
*27:07.800- 27:11.480* :  Superintendent Adrian Telfer from the Australian Federal Police.
*27:11.920- 27:17.400* :  As soon as we suspend our search, we notify authorities in New South Wales that the cocaine could
*27:17.400- 27:22.560* :  wash ashore down there and approximately six weeks later, if that's exactly what we saw. So
*27:23.060- 27:29.180* :  this stage, 256 kilograms has been recovered across New South Wales. Obviously during the
*27:29.180- 27:34.700* :  mass we believe there is more out there. Yes, another 600 kilograms remains unaccounted for
*27:34.700- 27:40.140* :  as for the accused. Ringleader, he's facing 19 charges and a maximum sentence of life in prison.
*27:40.400- 27:44.940* :  Australia is among the world's biggest drug users and especially when it comes to cocaine.
*27:44.940- 27:49.560* :  The latest figures from the organisation for economic cooperation and development
*27:49.560- 27:55.080* :  shows that more than four percent of Australians aged 15 to 64 had recently used cocaine.
*27:55.080- 27:59.760* :  That's about one million people and well above the second highest country in the United Kingdom.
*28:00.400- 28:06.180* :  Cocaine is extremely expensive in Australia so it's a lucrative business and clearly it's
*28:06.180- 28:12.500* :  keeping authorities very, very busy. Sean Wales, it was a moment the residents of Paris
*28:12.500- 28:17.560* :  are unlikely ever to forget. Five years ago this week, they looked up to see that one of the cities,
*28:17.560- 28:22.840* :  indeed, one of the country's most famous landmarks, Notre Dame Cathedral, was on fire.
*28:29.940- 28:34.140* :  While there was more bad news for the Cathedral's fans last month, when it was announced that
*28:34.140- 28:39.460* :  the country der hopes it would not reopen in time for the Paris Olympics this summer. However,
*28:39.460- 28:45.320* :  the scaffolding has been coming off the Cathedral's distinctive spire so that at least should be visible.
*28:45.860- 28:50.780* :  The Cathedral itself is now due to open in December following restoration work that involved
*28:50.780- 28:57.580* :  around 250 different companies and hundreds of skilled craftsmen and designers. Among them is
*28:57.580- 29:04.100* :  Damien Pinardia, UK-based carpenter originally from Argentina. This is highly specialised work
*29:04.360- 29:08.320* :  as we learned when he told my colleague Evan Davis about his particular role.
*29:09.020- 29:16.220* :  I shaped the trees into usable beams by axe and my main job was basically for five months
*29:16.260- 29:25.120* :  he knew as much as we could and we had a kind of a deadline to give our pieces to the next stage.
*29:25.500- 29:32.300* :  Then I was lucky enough to participate also in joinery as well to do a full raising and then I was
*29:32.300- 29:37.300* :  sent to Paris. So basically I did above everything which is quite amazing. But
*29:37.520- 29:42.060* :  Hang on, once you're background you came from Argentina, you're based in Scotland and you've
*29:42.060- 29:46.860* :  ended up helping out on on Notre Dame. I can't work out the path that gets you there.
*29:47.260- 29:54.320* :  I'm always trying to learn new different things and learning the French carpentry was one of my
*29:54.320- 30:00.480* :  goals and dreams got so much to learn still and to participate on this project since the day one
*30:00.480- 30:05.340* :  basically. It was a really really shocked when that happened. I'm part of the Carpenters Fellowship
*30:05.580- 30:11.040* :  which is an organisation of timber framing so there was a chance for us to collaborate with
*30:11.040- 30:17.700* :  the French carpenters and I was chosen among some other members of the CF, the Carpenters Fellowship
*30:17.700- 30:22.900* :  to be here on this project. But originally I'm a cabinet maker. Tell us about the actual site
*30:22.900- 30:28.740* :  in Paris at Notre Dame. Are people all falling over each other as they kind of work to restore
*30:29.920- 30:35.640* :  the mood on the site? It's amazing. Every single trade are involved in the same time. You know,
*30:35.640- 30:44.600* :  you're next to a restore of old gold leaves, a blacksmith, the mason's. So it's a massive community.
*30:44.600- 30:50.800* :  I mean this week I think we're about 600 people on site but it doesn't feel crowded because it's
*30:50.800- 30:56.280* :  quite a big site even though the space around is not that big. So we have to organise ourselves
*30:56.280- 31:02.160* :  very very well. Divide in the mood and the energy that you take for everyone involved is fantastic.
*31:02.160- 31:08.320* :  It's probably the best part of this adventure the people you work with. After the fire,
*31:08.540- 31:12.280* :  there were lots of people thinking about what to do with Notre Dame and there were some quite
*31:12.580- 31:18.020* :  flashy ideas about how you might make a contemporary cathedral out of the fire damage
*31:18.020- 31:21.780* :  original. I think they haven't really gone for any of that, have they? It's pretty much
*31:21.780- 31:27.960* :  just restore it. It's been completely restored as it was just before the fire. For us it's
*31:27.960- 31:33.160* :  just a pleasure not to be able to work on a cathedral and nowadays like they did almost
*31:33.160- 31:37.980* :  thousand years ago. You got a sensation of peace and all the energy that's been given to this
*31:37.980- 31:43.400* :  building. So it's very hard to leave this site. It's just amazing. You want to see every single
*31:43.400- 31:50.120* :  step of the way, how the sculptures restore, how the roof keeps growing. But soon my time will
*31:50.120- 31:54.700* :  be over. It's been more than a year and a half that I'm involved and probably in a few weeks or
*31:54.700- 31:59.280* :  a month I should be finished. I don't know if you saw the tragic fire in Copenhagen this week.
*31:59.340- 32:03.940* :  They compared it to Notre Dame, the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, there's going to be a similar task
*32:03.940- 32:09.880* :  on that. Presumably we got a Danish colleague that was working on the project for quite a long time,
*32:09.880- 32:15.980* :  so we're going to ask him to get us involved. Damien Penaadi on the restoration of Notre Dame
*32:16.140- 32:22.940* :  in Paris. And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News
