*01:27.140- 01:32.540* :  I'm Jackie Lennard and at 13 hours GMT on Friday, the 5th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:33.060- 01:37.200* :  The Israel Defence Forces have released their report into the killing of aid workers
*01:37.200- 01:38.660* :  delivering food to Gaza.
*01:39.220- 01:43.560* :  Israel's announced that more crossings are to be opened to allow aid into Gaza and we
*01:43.560- 01:46.700* :  remember the work of a pioneering feminist author who's died.
*01:48.560- 01:53.980* :  Also in this podcast as the 30th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide approaches, we hear
*01:53.980- 01:56.580* :  from communities about the reconciliation process.
*01:56.900- 02:03.200* :  I used to blame the former leadership which forced me to commit crimes, but the healing
*02:03.200- 02:06.740* :  process eventually made me acknowledge my responsibility.
*02:11.460- 02:15.600* :  The Israeli military has released the first findings of its investigation into the killing
*02:15.600- 02:18.160* :  of seven aid workers in Gaza on Monday.
*02:18.740- 02:24.640* :  It said the strike on the aid convoy was a grave mistake stemming from three major identification
*02:24.960- 02:25.600* :  failings.
*02:25.740- 02:30.960* :  The World Central Kitchen, the charity the victims worked for, said the IDF response
*02:30.960- 02:36.580* :  was cold comfort, adding that Israel could not credibly investigate its own failure in
*02:36.580- 02:37.040* :  Gaza.
*02:37.640- 02:40.920* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Joe Floto told us more.
*02:41.780- 02:47.460* :  So the report is the IDF's conclusion of what went on on April 1st that led to the
*02:47.460- 02:49.980* :  death of seven aid workers.
*02:50.220- 02:53.860* :  I was taken last night to the Ministry of Defence and shown some of the video evidence
*02:53.860- 02:59.020* :  that they presented to set the scene as it were for this decision-making process that
*02:59.020- 03:00.440* :  went catastrophically wrong.
*03:01.200- 03:08.620* :  They showed us some drone footage of the aid convoy where the logo of this World Central
*03:08.620- 03:11.640* :  Kitchen charity is not visible, they said that was critical.
*03:12.460- 03:20.080* :  They also showed us some video of Gunman who was on top of one of the aid lorries and
*03:20.080- 03:20.920* :  fired a shot.
*03:21.900- 03:26.880* :  And so they presented a context in which the drone unit that was operating in the area
*03:27.360- 03:31.580* :  was under the assumption that Hamas was operating and that this wasn't an aid convoy anymore,
*03:32.460- 03:34.120* :  that it was a Hamas convoy.
*03:34.180- 03:38.060* :  However, they acknowledged that they hadn't properly briefed everyone working in the unit
*03:39.180- 03:42.300* :  and in that area that a major aid operation was happening that night.
*03:43.200- 03:49.040* :  And then they said that a catastrophic mistake was made when that unit misidentified an
*03:49.040- 03:54.280* :  aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman carrying a rifle and as such asked for authorization
*03:54.440- 04:02.280* :  to fire a missile at one of the cars, they were given that authorization and they fired
*04:02.280- 04:02.720* :  a missile.
*04:02.940- 04:07.040* :  What we also learnt was that the aid workers survived that initial strike, two people left
*04:07.040- 04:11.520* :  that car and jumped into the second car in the convoy and drove off and were then struck
*04:12.240- 04:17.900* :  by a second missile and there were survivors from that and they jumped into the third car
*04:17.900- 04:22.580* :  which two minutes later was hit by the final missile which left everyone dead.
*04:23.360- 04:27.420* :  And what sort of reaction to this report might we expect from both the Israeli government
*04:27.420- 04:28.500* :  and the Israeli public?
*04:29.080- 04:33.180* :  Well, the Israeli government I think we've already had a reaction because based on the
*04:33.180- 04:39.300* :  outrage that followed Monday's killings, the United States President has insisted that
*04:39.300- 04:40.180* :  things have to change.
*04:40.180- 04:46.180* :  So what we've seen initially is the response to ramp up aid provision and things that
*04:46.740- 04:52.520* :  Israel's allies, notably the US and the UK have been demanding requesting cleaning for
*04:52.520- 04:57.560* :  the last few months, are now being put into operation, namely that the port of Ashton,
*04:57.560- 05:02.500* :  a major container port, just 45 minutes drive from the north of Gaza, is going to be
*05:02.500- 05:08.080* :  allowed to process aid destined for the war zone, that they are going to open another
*05:08.080- 05:09.660* :  crossing in the north of Gaza.
*05:09.660- 05:13.400* :  The area is crossing which is largely destroyed during the October 7th events but is still
*05:13.400- 05:18.980* :  an entry point from Israel into the north of Gaza and that convoys will be allowed, road
*05:18.980- 05:24.660* :  convoys will be allowed to bring aid in from Jordan traversing the whole of Israel to get
*05:24.660- 05:25.540* :  to the Gaza Strip.
*05:25.580- 05:27.000* :  So those are the main concrete thing.
*05:27.820- 05:31.840* :  Yes, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has been in Belgium today.
*05:31.840- 05:35.620* :  He said he welcomed the announcement, the commitment to allow in more aid.
*05:35.960- 05:38.020* :  But he said they do need to see action.
*05:38.360- 05:43.740* :  We welcome the steps that have been announced by Israel, opening areas as a new crossing
*05:43.740- 05:50.340* :  point, having shipments go directly from the Ashton port, maximizing the route from Jordan.
*05:51.600- 05:56.580* :  These are positive developments but the real test is results and that's what we're looking
*05:56.580- 05:59.660* :  to see in the coming days and in the coming weeks.
*06:00.040- 06:04.920* :  And Joe, given the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza, how soon might we expect
*06:04.920- 06:09.720* :  to see some movement and these new aid flows reaching the people who need them?
*06:10.280- 06:11.620* :  That's a very big question.
*06:11.620- 06:16.480* :  There will be anxiety amongst some that this isn't going to come fast enough but one
*06:16.480- 06:21.200* :  of the things they have to do before they open up these aid routes is to sort out the
*06:21.200- 06:26.020* :  safety of aid distribution and the events of last Monday have raised some big questions
*06:26.020- 06:31.440* :  in the minds of those working for the aid organisations but also in the military here
*06:31.800- 06:35.820* :  about how they need to change to make sure they don't kill any more aid workers.
*06:36.380- 06:37.440* :  That was Joe Floto.
*06:38.120- 06:43.980* :  Well, even before the latest moves, Israel insisted it did everything possible to avoid civilian
*06:43.980- 06:47.280* :  casualties and it offers one key piece of evidence for this.
*06:47.580- 06:52.360* :  When civilians are potentially in harm's way, it says it warns them of a forthcoming
*06:52.360- 06:54.580* :  attack, advising people to evacuate.
*06:55.180- 06:58.400* :  Leaflets are dropped, text messages sent to mobile phones.
*06:59.200- 07:03.860* :  But new analysis by the BBC says the information carried in these warnings is often wrong,
*07:03.860- 07:06.100* :  contradictory or just plain confusing.
*07:06.680- 07:11.120* :  The Israeli military rejects this suggestion but our correspondent Stephanie Hegati has
*07:11.120- 07:13.220* :  analysed the warnings and sent this report.
*07:15.260- 07:18.280* :  In late December, Salah Ahmed was in central Gaza.
*07:19.140- 07:22.240* :  Salah Saeratkam has been under attack.
*07:23.020- 07:25.180* :  People were pouring out of a shelter nearby.
*07:26.140- 07:30.780* :  I went out and I saw hundreds of people evacuating from the north side of the Salah area.
*07:31.100- 07:34.160* :  Salah didn't know he was subject to an evacuation warning.
*07:34.540- 07:38.400* :  When he did get online, he found this, posted by the Israeli army.
*07:38.700- 07:39.100* :  It read,
*07:39.380- 07:44.640* :  Do the residents of Buraj and the neighbourhoods of Al-Bada, Al-Rauda, Al-Nusin?
*07:44.640- 07:48.540* :  The warning had a list of neighbourhoods and numbered blocks to be evacuated.
*07:48.860- 07:52.320* :  In blocks 2220, 2210.
*07:52.960- 07:57.720* :  Underneath the text was a map of Gaza, with the evacuation zone highlighted in orange,
*07:58.280- 08:01.260* :  and a QR code that linked to another map online.
*08:01.920- 08:07.680* :  Two months into war with Hamas, Israel presented a new system for warning civilians about impending attacks.
*08:08.380- 08:11.160* :  It divided Gaza up into hundreds of numbered blocks,
*08:11.940- 08:16.080* :  and an online interactive map helped people to figure out what block they were in.
*08:16.520- 08:21.520* :  Then the IDF issued warnings on social media by phone and on leaflets dropped over Gaza.
*08:22.280- 08:25.540* :  When blocks were listed in the warnings, people were expected to leave.
*08:25.740- 08:31.260* :  We analysed all the warnings published by the IDF's Arabic social media channels since the first of December,
*08:31.640- 08:33.780* :  as well as a limited number of leaflets we could find,
*08:33.780- 08:35.740* :  photographed and shared online.
*08:35.740- 08:39.960* :  They contained vital information for people to follow to escape to safer areas,
*08:40.540- 08:42.340* :  but they also contained many errors.
*08:43.240- 08:47.500* :  Of the 26 separate warnings we found, 17 of them contained errors.
*08:48.040- 08:53.440* :  One of the most common problems was a mismatch between the text of the warning and the map accompanying it.
*08:54.020- 08:55.240* :  This happened 12 times.
*08:55.880- 08:58.560* :  Here you can see the IDF's Arabic Twitter account,
*08:58.580- 09:01.820* :  providing information for civilians to evacuate specifically.
*09:01.840- 09:04.080* :  In January at the International Court of Justice,
*09:04.560- 09:08.020* :  lawyers for Israel presented one of these warnings posted on social media
*09:08.020- 09:11.200* :  as an example of the lengths it was going to to protect civilians.
*09:11.220- 09:16.340* :  To the residents of Hanunas, in area blocks 47, 55.
*09:16.340- 09:18.040* :  But we found two errors in that warning.
*09:18.860- 09:22.740* :  Block 55 and 99 were listed in the text of the post,
*09:22.740- 09:24.820* :  but they weren't shaded on the accompanying map.
*09:25.880- 09:29.680* :  When presented with this evidence, the IDF didn't address mistakes in maps specifically,
*09:29.680- 09:33.400* :  but said the text of the post was sufficiently clear to avoid any confusion.
*09:34.180- 09:38.580* :  But people in Gaza have told the BBC about their struggle to understand these warnings,
*09:39.380- 09:41.860* :  as well as their difficulty getting online to access them.
*09:42.140- 09:45.320* :  When Salah received his warning, he was in Nusrat refugee camp.
*09:45.880- 09:48.980* :  The camp wasn't mentioned in the text, but he managed to figure out his block,
*09:48.980- 09:52.540* :  and then he saw on the accompanying map that it was cut in two.
*09:53.120- 09:54.240* :  And his family were confused.
*09:54.880- 09:56.020* :  He left with his children.
*09:56.540- 09:58.700* :  There were other issues with this warning too.
*09:59.280- 10:06.760* :  We struggled to find some of the neighbourhoods listed on social media and on a leaflet dropped over Gaza.
*10:06.780- 10:11.780* :  The warning said that all of the neighbourhoods listed were in the area south of Wadi Gaza,
*10:12.240- 10:14.380* :  a riverbed that splits the strip in two.
*10:15.500- 10:19.340* :  But we found two of these neighbourhoods just north of the riverbed.
*10:19.800- 10:22.320* :  The IDF didn't address this contradiction specifically,
*10:22.320- 10:27.280* :  but said that when a neighbourhood was listed, it was clear that the entire neighbourhood should evacuate.
*10:27.960- 10:32.980* :  The IDF told the BBC that these posts were only part of a multifaceted and extensive effort
*10:32.980- 10:37.940* :  to move civilians out of harm's way, which included millions of leaflets and pre-recorded phone calls
*10:38.420- 10:40.580* :  and tens of thousands of live phone calls.
*10:40.580- 10:45.740* :  It said IDF warnings have saved countless civilian lives in the Gaza strip.
*10:46.520- 10:47.340* :  Stephanie Heggity.
*10:48.660- 10:51.320* :  He says he rarely uses the word catastrophic,
*10:51.320- 10:58.140* :  but a senior official with the World Health Organization has told the BBC that it now applies to the crisis in Sudan.
*10:58.300- 11:04.720* :  The conflict there is a vicious power struggle between the military and a paramilitary group which erupted last April.
*11:05.320- 11:08.820* :  Richard Brennan, the regional emergency director with the WHO,
*11:08.900- 11:13.620* :  has just returned from a visit to Sudan and has been speaking to my colleague, Jo Inwood.
*11:14.220- 11:17.880* :  This is one of the largest and most acute humanitarian crises in the world.
*11:17.880- 11:21.620* :  Twenty-four point eight million people needing humanitarian assistance.
*11:22.420- 11:27.400* :  More people displaced acutely than any other crisis in the world right now.
*11:28.200- 11:35.480* :  Still high levels of violence and very limited access for humanitarian actors to reach those in need.
*11:35.480- 11:42.840* :  It's about half the states now where we either have no access for them inside Sudan or very limited access.
*11:42.840- 11:49.760* :  So we're trying to scale up operations across the border from Chad and also from South Sudan and looking at other options.
*11:50.620- 11:54.780* :  But I've been working in humanitarian assistance for over 30 years.
*11:54.780- 12:01.320* :  I rarely use the term catastrophic, but I'm using it for two of our crises today, Gaza and Sudan.
*12:01.620- 12:06.800* :  Just to explain to people or for you to explain to us, what are the health,
*12:06.860- 12:09.940* :  what are the various crises we're actually seeing?
*12:09.940- 12:12.500* :  Because you say it's catastrophic, how does that manifest itself?
*12:13.800- 12:15.640* :  Well, first of all, high levels of violence are persist.
*12:16.060- 12:21.320* :  So, I mean, our estimates are well-short of probably the reality because we just can't get there to document.
*12:21.320- 12:26.320* :  But we know there's been over 14,000 violent deaths and over 35,000 injuries.
*12:26.900- 12:36.340* :  That's the first thing. Secondly, we've got at least five disease outbreaks ongoing, cholera, measles, malaria, dengue and so on.
*12:37.160- 12:38.860* :  What we call vaccine-derived polio.
*12:39.500- 12:44.460* :  Thirdly, there's soaring levels of food insecurity and malnutrition.
*12:45.020- 12:51.000* :  We estimate now that 17 million people are what we call acutely food insecure.
*12:51.700- 12:56.780* :  And that translates into about half the kids under the age of five being acutely malnutrition.
*12:57.040- 13:00.080* :  I realize we probably haven't explained that we have two sides here.
*13:00.080- 13:03.620* :  You've got the Sudanese National Army and the rapid support forces.
*13:03.620- 13:09.100* :  One is the National Army and the other is a sort of paramilitary force who are fighting over the country.
*13:09.240- 13:15.900* :  Are you finding that the issues are worse in the areas controlled by one group or the other?
*13:15.900- 13:19.920* :  How's the balance in terms of where the harm is?
*13:20.140- 13:21.940* :  Well, I would say on balance. Yes.
*13:21.940- 13:26.100* :  The areas that are controlled by the RSF, we have less access.
*13:27.060- 13:31.240* :  The areas controlled by the RSF, there would be higher levels of violence.
*13:31.920- 13:35.260* :  But it's a very difficult operating environment regardless.
*13:36.640- 13:40.760* :  And again, there's been major disruption of basic infrastructure,
*13:40.760- 13:46.180* :  including hospitals and water systems and so on, right across the country.
*13:47.020- 13:47.660* :  Richard Brannon.
*13:48.900- 13:52.280* :  Lynn Reed Banks, who has died at the age of 94,
*13:52.280- 13:56.380* :  was one of the first women in Britain to become a television news reporter.
*13:56.960- 14:02.400* :  But one of her most famous creations was the trailblazing feminist novel, The L-shaped Room.
*14:02.460- 14:07.400* :  The film version led to a best-actress Oscar nomination for Leslie Caron.
*14:07.980- 14:11.680* :  Lizo Mazimba's report begins with a clip from the movie.
*14:12.740- 14:13.680* :  Father? Mm-hmm.
*14:15.240- 14:15.820* :  I'm pregnant.
*14:16.340- 14:19.960* :  The L-shaped Room shocked readers in the early 1960s.
*14:20.040- 14:22.520* :  Do say something. For God's sake.
*14:23.140- 14:27.560* :  The story of Jane, an unmarried woman who's thrown out by her father
*14:27.920- 14:29.080* :  when she becomes pregnant,
*14:29.080- 14:34.900* :  helped to introduce readers to a new style of writing that was gritty and raw.
*14:35.440- 14:38.380* :  And that reflected the realities of post-war life
*14:38.380- 14:43.880* :  before the huge social changes of the 1960s swept around the world.
*14:44.380- 14:50.440* :  When I reread the book, it was like reading a book written not only by another person,
*14:50.800- 14:52.900* :  but about a completely different era.
*14:52.900- 14:56.100* :  I mean, it might as well have been a hundred years ago as 50.
*14:56.440- 15:00.900* :  She wrote the book, her first, while she was working as a television reporter.
*15:01.420- 15:06.880* :  The success of the L-shaped Room helped her to eventually become a full-time novelist.
*15:07.160- 15:12.060* :  She produced two sequels, but it was perhaps in children's literature
*15:12.420- 15:14.340* :  that she had the biggest impact.
*15:14.680- 15:16.120* :  You're a real Indian.
*15:17.220- 15:19.020* :  You're real.
*15:19.960- 15:23.860* :  Most notably with her fantasy novel, The Indian in the cupboard,
*15:24.380- 15:28.900* :  where a young boy discovers that when toys are locked inside a magical cupboard,
*15:29.320- 15:30.300* :  they come to life.
*15:30.960- 15:36.600* :  She went on to write more than 40 books for all ages and across a range of different genres
*15:37.040- 15:40.400* :  in a career that spanned more than half a century.
*15:41.200- 15:41.940* :  Lise O'Mazimba.
*15:44.280- 15:45.520* :  Still to come in this podcast.
*15:45.520- 15:50.640* :  What the data seemed to be telling us is that, in fact, the dark energy is not
*15:51.180- 15:52.800* :  Einstein's cosmological constant.
*15:52.800- 15:56.560* :  It's something a lot more interesting and a lot more complicated.
*15:56.940- 15:59.360* :  The biggest ever 3D map of the universe,
*15:59.760- 16:03.060* :  raising questions about the nature of dark energy and its future.
*16:10.120- 16:10.840* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*16:10.840- 16:14.800* :  At Mid-Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*16:15.180- 16:16.140* :  They charge you a lot.
*16:16.140- 16:17.480* :  We charge you a little.
*16:17.780- 16:21.400* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*16:21.400- 16:25.200* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*16:25.500- 16:25.840* :  That's right.
*16:25.840- 16:30.460* :  We're cutting the price of mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*16:40.160- 16:44.880* :  What connects cinema and buns Bluetooth and one of the most famous music apps of all time?
*16:45.440- 16:46.620* :  It's Sweden, of course.
*16:46.620- 16:50.500* :  And witness history is celebrating Scandinavia's biggest country
*16:50.940- 16:52.380* :  with a bumper week of programs.
*16:52.380- 16:56.740* :  So tune in as we hear from Abba's manager 50 years on
*16:56.740- 16:58.720* :  from their iconic Eurovision victory,
*16:59.220- 17:01.480* :  feast on Sweden's annual cinema and Bunde
*17:01.480- 17:05.920* :  and strap yourself in as we tell you all about the invention of the seat belt.
*17:06.220- 17:08.680* :  That's witness history from the BBC World Service.
*17:09.120- 17:12.040* :  Listen and subscribe wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:19.100- 17:24.100* :  30 years ago, a plane carrying the then Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi was shot down,
*17:24.600- 17:25.740* :  killing everyone on board.
*17:26.480- 17:30.240* :  It was the spark for one of the bloodiest genocides in human history.
*17:30.240- 17:36.720* :  Around 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda by ethnic Hutu extremists over 100 days.
*17:37.380- 17:40.360* :  They targeted members of the minority Tutsi community,
*17:40.360- 17:43.840* :  but also anyone who opposed those genocidal intentions,
*17:44.300- 17:46.380* :  irrespective of their ethnic origin.
*17:47.260- 17:51.080* :  Three decades later, the BBC's Victoria Uwonghunder,
*17:51.440- 17:53.500* :  who herself fled the violence at the time,
*17:53.500- 17:58.640* :  traveled back to Rwanda to find out how communities are reconciling with each other.
*17:59.000- 18:01.520* :  We've been driving for a couple of hours from Kigali.
*18:01.860- 18:05.040* :  We're here to meet a group of perpetrators and survivors,
*18:05.300- 18:07.660* :  and they're brought together by one Christian organisation
*18:07.760- 18:12.900* :  that has used cows, which are quite integral to our culture,
*18:12.900- 18:17.920* :  to help find a reconciliation after the genocide of 1994.
*18:18.660- 18:23.080* :  The idea is to look after that cow, to take care of it together.
*18:23.880- 18:28.260* :  His soft-boinging bubble is the founder of the cow for peace project.
*18:28.820- 18:30.180* :  So when we give them the cow,
*18:31.560- 18:36.780* :  as a way of creating a bridge, to allow their process of forgiveness and reconciliation.
*18:37.720- 18:42.000* :  At the age of 24, Everest killed a neighbour, a family friend.
*18:43.420- 18:46.220* :  We attacked from the other side of the road,
*18:46.920- 18:48.540* :  and we infiltrated the crowd.
*18:49.940- 18:51.720* :  Some were taken to other places,
*18:52.420- 18:55.900* :  and we stayed here with others, including Nasis's mother.
*18:56.900- 19:00.260* :  I was offered the cow if I accepted it to kill her.
*19:00.880- 19:04.960* :  And in this group, listening also is Nasis Rwamucho.
*19:05.720- 19:09.760* :  The person Everest is describing killing was Nasis's mother.
*19:13.440- 19:15.540* :  I had lost my parents and my siblings,
*19:16.260- 19:20.180* :  and especially because Everest was the only perpetrator close to me.
*19:20.800- 19:24.620* :  To me, he was not only a murderer, as he said, but a monster.
*19:25.280- 19:28.520* :  Everest went through the traditional Rwandan justice system,
*19:28.880- 19:33.980* :  Gachacha courts, local community hearings, and was sentenced to 18 years.
*19:34.560- 19:39.160* :  I arranged to meet two people who had been part of a reconciliation project
*19:39.160- 19:43.260* :  through their local church in Yamata, on the outskirts of Kigali.
*19:43.800- 19:47.100* :  One of the people who survived is Claudette Mokaru Manzi.
*19:49.260- 19:51.680* :  He had a stick and a spear in his hands.
*19:52.240- 19:53.860* :  He stopped my back with a spear.
*19:54.260- 19:59.120* :  After a while, I reached back and removed the spear and threw it away.
*19:59.700- 20:04.560* :  With blood running over her face, Claudette sought refuge into a neighbour's house.
*20:05.500- 20:09.560* :  There, she came face to face with yet another attacker.
*20:10.400- 20:12.780* :  That man was there sitting with us.
*20:13.480- 20:15.580* :  He was also listening to Claudette's story.
*20:16.160- 20:18.480* :  His name is Jean-Claude Nambara.
*20:19.400- 20:23.520* :  I used to blame the former leadership which forced me to commit crimes,
*20:24.200- 20:28.660* :  but the healing process eventually made me acknowledge my responsibility.
*20:29.600- 20:32.620* :  Jean-Claude was also found guilty for his crimes.
*20:32.620- 20:35.480* :  He was sentenced to community work.
*20:35.480- 20:38.940* :  There are those who feel the country's not gone far enough.
*20:39.600- 20:43.180* :  Karin Kanimba is the daughter of Paul Roussezavagina,
*20:43.560- 20:45.800* :  who inspired the film Hotel Randa.
*20:46.360- 20:49.720* :  We need to have a real conversation about the truth of our history
*20:50.300- 20:55.040* :  and without these dialogues taking place which have been prohibited by the regime,
*20:55.540- 20:57.500* :  then there is no clear future.
*20:58.340- 21:01.440* :  This is something the Randa government refutes and says
*21:01.440- 21:04.800* :  there have been huge strides in bringing people together
*21:04.800- 21:07.780* :  and allowing them to talk about what happened.
*21:08.260- 21:11.120* :  Yolanda Makolo is the Randa government spokesperson.
*21:11.120- 21:13.880* :  The Randaans are talking very openly about what it meant,
*21:13.880- 21:15.340* :  whatever background they are from,
*21:15.780- 21:18.000* :  what they felt about this process of reconciliation,
*21:18.000- 21:19.720* :  what happened to their families,
*21:20.300- 21:21.700* :  what it means to be a young Randaan.
*21:22.940- 21:27.000* :  The healing of a country begins with individuals making peace
*21:27.500- 21:29.280* :  and having the space to do so.
*21:30.280- 21:31.700* :  Since it begins up here,
*21:31.980- 21:33.540* :  I do not know when I will die,
*21:34.120- 21:37.100* :  but I felt like if I died without forgiving him,
*21:37.780- 21:39.420* :  the burden could be on my children.
*21:40.180- 21:41.920* :  I cannot pass that on to my children.
*21:42.600- 21:45.120* :  And that's where we find Randa that year's on.
*21:45.400- 21:46.700* :  The road has been long
*21:47.240- 21:49.200* :  and there may still be a way to go,
*21:49.680- 21:53.980* :  but there are glimpses of hope, strength and resilience.
*21:56.140- 21:57.720* :  Victoria Wong-Hunder
*21:58.920- 22:01.460* :  Intense rainfall has been causing havoc across
*22:01.460- 22:05.980* :  southeastern Australia as a month's worth of rain fell in just 24 hours.
*22:06.440- 22:09.080* :  The biggest city Sydney has been hit by major flooding.
*22:09.080- 22:12.120* :  Our reporter Phil Mercer has been trying to stay dry.
*22:12.660- 22:17.380* :  It's been heaving it down all day in Sydney roads have been turned into rivers,
*22:17.380- 22:23.400* :  dozens of domestic flights from Sydney airport have been delayed or cancelled.
*22:23.400- 22:29.120* :  There's been chaos for commuters trying to get home on buses and especially on trains.
*22:29.120- 22:34.540* :  And as you say, the state of New South Wales today has received,
*22:34.540- 22:38.860* :  or in the last 24 hours, received a month's worth of rain.
*22:38.860- 22:43.360* :  There have been warnings of dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding
*22:43.360- 22:49.540* :  in parts of the blue mountains to the west of Sydney and also regions to the south.
*22:49.920- 22:52.960* :  Warigambadam, this is Sydney's main reservoir.
*22:52.960- 22:58.020* :  It supplies Australia's biggest city with much of its drinking water.
*22:58.500- 23:01.280* :  It is expected to overflow on Monday.
*23:01.280- 23:05.020* :  It's currently around 96% of capacity.
*23:05.600- 23:07.880* :  And when it does overflow as seems certain,
*23:07.880- 23:15.280* :  it will increase the risk of flooding in many low-lying areas on the fringes of Sydney city.
*23:16.100- 23:19.060* :  How ready was Australia for this?
*23:19.160- 23:22.940* :  I mean, scientists have been warning climate change is driving intense weather, haven't they?
*23:23.240- 23:25.060* :  Well, Australia is the vast islands.
*23:25.120- 23:31.340* :  This is a place that is well used to nature's extreme scientists have for years been warning
*23:31.340- 23:38.420* :  that climate change is making storms and floods as well as heatwaves and bushfires more intense.
*23:38.420- 23:41.020* :  It was interesting to note, in the last couple of days,
*23:41.020- 23:45.460* :  we received research from the Australian National University warning
*23:45.460- 23:50.080* :  that Australia could soon face more intense and longer droughts.
*23:50.360- 23:53.480* :  And some of these mega droughts could go on for 20 years.
*23:53.740- 23:57.680* :  And of course, drought is far from the minds of many people.
*23:57.680- 24:02.000* :  It's not just Sydney that's been affected by this intense rainfall.
*24:02.000- 24:07.820* :  Parts of southern Queensland, the rain and the thunderstorms are expected to continue
*24:07.820- 24:08.880* :  well into Saturday.
*24:09.540- 24:13.120* :  So, yes, Australia well used to nature's extremes,
*24:13.120- 24:17.280* :  but these sorts of very severe events do create chaos
*24:17.820- 24:20.940* :  and potentially life-threatening flash flooding as well.
*24:21.700- 24:22.220* :  Phil Mercer.
*24:23.040- 24:27.360* :  It's been more than four decades since the former communist ruler of Yugoslavia,
*24:27.360- 24:29.080* :  Josip Broz Tito, died.
*24:29.080- 24:33.680* :  But his resting place in Belgrade might not be final after all.
*24:34.160- 24:38.520* :  The acting mayor of the capital of Serbia is calling for his remains to be removed
*24:39.080- 24:41.000* :  and sent to his birthplace in Croatia.
*24:41.760- 24:43.940* :  Tito, who was married to a Serb,
*24:44.180- 24:46.860* :  whose father was Croatian and mother Slovenian,
*24:46.860- 24:52.240* :  remains a controversial figure in the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
*24:52.880- 24:55.080* :  Our Balkans correspondent is Guida Lorne,
*24:55.780- 24:59.200* :  so why does the acting mayor want the remains removed?
*25:00.200- 25:03.780* :  Well, Alexander Šapeć, he shoots from the lip, shall we say.
*25:03.780- 25:07.360* :  He's well-known for his pronouncements on all sorts of different issues
*25:07.360- 25:10.660* :  on which he seems to take not a particularly considered point of view.
*25:11.140- 25:15.040* :  On this occasion, he's basically trying to paint out Tito
*25:15.560- 25:20.340* :  as being an enemy of the Serbian people, and he has described him most witheringly
*25:20.700- 25:26.220* :  as an Austro-Hungarian soldier who shot at the Serbs in the First World War,
*25:26.520- 25:32.060* :  and then in essence implied that he prevented the Serbian nation from reaching its full flowering
*25:32.360- 25:38.220* :  during the time of Yugoslavia, and at where he's interred now in his mausoleum
*25:38.420- 25:40.140* :  in the House of Flowers in Belgrade,
*25:40.560- 25:43.180* :  it should be turned over to true Serbian heroes,
*25:43.680- 25:45.820* :  people like the convicted war criminal,
*25:46.160- 25:50.600* :  Dražima Hilovic, who was executed for collaborating with the Nazis.
*25:50.980- 25:53.960* :  Tito wanted this to be his final resting place, they didn't he?
*25:54.280- 25:56.960* :  Absolutely, he did, and Tito was the greatest believer
*25:57.560- 26:01.200* :  in the socialist federal republic of Yugoslavia that ever there was.
*26:01.620- 26:04.180* :  He wasn't born in Serbia, he was born in Croatia,
*26:04.180- 26:08.200* :  he had one parent who was Croat, he had another parent who was Slovenia,
*26:08.420- 26:12.140* :  and he truly believed that it was best for the people of Yugoslavia,
*26:12.620- 26:16.400* :  that they all ministered that they had families that were intermarried
*26:16.940- 26:20.780* :  when you did your military service, you didn't do it in your home federation,
*26:20.840- 26:22.540* :  you had to go to a different federation,
*26:23.120- 26:27.560* :  so him being buried in Belgrade, his wife alongside him,
*26:27.560- 26:32.480* :  that was as far as he was concerned, his wish, and his granddaughter, Svetlana Broz,
*26:32.940- 26:35.080* :  has been talking about this idea of moving him,
*26:35.460- 26:37.700* :  and she says it's an idiotic idea.
*26:38.040- 26:42.560* :  What about Croatia, any comment from Croatia about the possibility of moving him there?
*26:43.120- 26:46.940* :  Now that's a funny one, Croatia, because a few years ago in Zagreb,
*26:46.940- 26:51.360* :  they renamed one of the main squares there from a martial Tito square
*26:51.860- 26:55.780* :  to Republic of Croatia Square, and this is a nationalist move,
*26:55.780- 26:59.780* :  you know, they were erasing Tito's legacies there and putting something,
*27:00.180- 27:02.560* :  you know, national pride issue in its place,
*27:02.640- 27:04.740* :  and that caused quite a lot of controversy at the time,
*27:05.420- 27:08.500* :  but the town of Kumbravets, where Tito was actually born,
*27:08.500- 27:11.000* :  already has a Tito museum there,
*27:11.540- 27:16.260* :  and they've said they would absolutely love to host his mortal remains,
*27:16.260- 27:19.100* :  because they reckon that would bring the visitors in big time,
*27:19.100- 27:21.360* :  they reckon they'd get a million visitors a year,
*27:21.360- 27:25.680* :  if Tito were there, rather than in the house of flowers in Belgrade,
*27:25.680- 27:27.060* :  so as far as that concerned,
*27:27.620- 27:32.380* :  please, we're ready to welcome the former leader of Yugoslavia with open arms.
*27:32.720- 27:33.780* :  How likely is that?
*27:34.100- 27:36.800* :  I don't think this is going to get very far at all.
*27:37.040- 27:43.200* :  It's a very serious thing to be talking about moving Tito from this particular place,
*27:43.720- 27:47.980* :  and Tito's granddaughter rather suspects that Alexander Sapeć
*27:47.980- 27:53.140* :  has got the June Meryl elections in mind when he's making these sort of pronouncements,
*27:53.360- 27:57.000* :  perhaps going after the hard right nationalist servote.
*27:57.400- 27:58.300* :  That was Guadalorne.
*27:59.020- 28:02.440* :  Scientists have made the largest 3D map of the universe,
*28:02.920- 28:06.200* :  measuring how fast it has expanded over billions of years
*28:06.600- 28:08.660* :  by using the most precise measurements to date.
*28:08.660- 28:14.220* :  An international team used an instrument known as the Dark Energy Spectrogues
*28:14.220- 28:16.800* :  Scopic Instrument, Dezi, to create the map.
*28:17.280- 28:20.360* :  One of them was Professor Carlos Frank from Durham University,
*28:20.360- 28:22.620* :  and he's been speaking to my colleague Justin Webb.
*28:23.160- 28:24.600* :  There's two aspects to this.
*28:24.600- 28:27.700* :  The first one, I think, is if it's a technical aspect,
*28:27.700- 28:29.380* :  but I think it's mind-boggling,
*28:29.420- 28:36.400* :  and that is the fact that we are now able to measure fundamental properties of our universe,
*28:37.000- 28:39.380* :  such as the speed at which it is expanding,
*28:40.040- 28:44.240* :  at laboratory physics precision at a precision of 1%.
*28:44.900- 28:49.480* :  So we're talking about galaxies that are billions of light years ago,
*28:49.760- 28:51.060* :  that are billions of years old,
*28:51.600- 28:55.640* :  and yet we are able to measure the rate at which the universe expands
*28:55.640- 28:57.320* :  to this amazing precision.
*28:58.160- 29:02.240* :  And the result of that, of course, when you measure something so precisely,
*29:02.840- 29:07.900* :  you can then question whether the models that we have of the Big Bang
*29:07.900- 29:13.400* :  and the universe are actually stand up to this program amazing measurements.
*29:13.400- 29:16.760* :  And so what we have found, in fact,
*29:17.020- 29:19.240* :  well, we know for a hundred years that the universe is expanding.
*29:19.900- 29:23.700* :  And what was discovered about 25 years ago
*29:24.080- 29:26.100* :  is that not only is the universe expanding,
*29:26.100- 29:29.600* :  it's expanding faster and faster and faster as time goes by.
*29:30.480- 29:35.060* :  And that means that in the universe there's some mysterious component,
*29:35.100- 29:40.960* :  which is pushing the universe, it acts against the attraction of gravity produced by matter.
*29:41.380- 29:43.300* :  And that is what we call dark energy.
*29:44.100- 29:46.400* :  So until now, for the last 20 years,
*29:48.140- 29:49.640* :  we don't understand what the dark energy is,
*29:49.640- 29:53.040* :  but we sought refuge on Einstein in Einstein.
*29:53.620- 29:55.640* :  And Einstein came up with a proposal,
*29:56.300- 29:57.640* :  also over a hundred years ago,
*29:58.120- 30:03.220* :  that maybe the universe contained something appropriately called Einstein's cosmological constant.
*30:03.800- 30:06.520* :  And we've lived with this constant now for 25 years,
*30:06.980- 30:10.520* :  but now what the data from Desi are telling us,
*30:10.660- 30:12.380* :  and this is very preliminary, a most stress,
*30:12.760- 30:15.880* :  it's very preliminary, but what the data seem to be telling us
*30:16.300- 30:19.360* :  is that, in fact, the dark energy is not Einstein's
*30:19.360- 30:24.220* :  cosmological constant, it's something a lot more interesting and a lot more complicated.
*30:24.440- 30:25.820* :  If it is a lot more interesting,
*30:26.560- 30:28.820* :  and I take your point, there's a lot more complicated as well,
*30:28.820- 30:33.320* :  but in a couple of minutes, what is it, or what might it be?
*30:34.460- 30:36.540* :  Well, it is some mysterious form of energy,
*30:36.540- 30:38.620* :  but rather than being constant,
*30:38.620- 30:41.080* :  it seems to be changing with time.
*30:41.500- 30:45.940* :  And that is fascinating because it will force us to go back
*30:45.940- 30:50.600* :  and reconsider the basic understanding of physics,
*30:51.180- 30:53.340* :  or basic understanding of the Big Bang,
*30:53.760- 30:58.040* :  and also our basic understanding of the long-range forecast for our universe.
*30:58.460- 31:01.280* :  When we thought the dark energy was just Einstein's constant,
*31:01.840- 31:06.740* :  the universe fades, and I mean in a very, very, very long term future,
*31:07.180- 31:07.880* :  was rather boring.
*31:08.140- 31:10.160* :  The universe would just continue expanding forever,
*31:10.800- 31:14.000* :  getting cold, everything would be decaying,
*31:14.000- 31:16.300* :  and essentially not much would happen,
*31:16.340- 31:18.580* :  the universe would just expand to eternity.
*31:18.580- 31:22.900* :  And what this new discovery opens up is the possibility
*31:22.900- 31:26.680* :  that a long-range future might be more interesting,
*31:26.680- 31:30.900* :  that it opens up the possibility that we might be heading for a big crunch.
*31:31.760- 31:33.680* :  That was Professor Carlos Frank.
*31:35.820- 31:36.880* :  And that's it for us for now,
*31:36.880- 31:39.860* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*31:40.300- 31:42.600* :  And don't forget, the happy pod will be out on Saturday,
*31:42.600- 31:45.820* :  including a rescue from the frozen wilderness in Lapland,
