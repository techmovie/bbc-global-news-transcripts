*01:26.480- 01:32.180* :  hours of Sunday, the 7th of April, these are our main stories. Tens of thousands of anti-government
*01:32.180- 01:37.480* :  demonstrators have returned to the streets of Tel Aviv after the Israeli military recovered the
*01:37.480- 01:43.540* :  body of a hostage from Gaza. The head of NATO says the West is facing an alliance of authoritarian
*01:43.540- 01:50.560* :  powers comprised of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. Nicaragua has become the latest
*01:50.560- 01:56.260* :  Latin American country to cut ties with Ecuador in protest and the arrest of a politician
*01:56.260- 02:01.780* :  who've been sheltering in the Mexican Embassy in Italy. Also in this podcast.
*02:01.780- 02:08.720* :  A lot of them have come a long way. Australia, Japan, Peru, you name it. They're coming
*02:08.720- 02:13.800* :  on as a homage to Hamstrapple. It's the meat sign if it's in the owner of the bakery.
*02:13.800- 02:19.720* :  Thousands of fans of the British pop star Harry Styles have been flocking to a sleepy village in
*02:19.720- 02:25.740* :  northern England to see where he grew up. We begin in Israel.
*02:33.740- 02:38.800* :  Tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand the government
*02:38.800- 02:43.960* :  of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does a deal to secure the release of some
*02:43.960- 02:51.860* :  130 Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza. This man said it was time for Mr. Netanyahu
*02:52.020- 02:57.500* :  to go. I think it's a shame we still have been at Netanyahu as the Prime Minister. I think
*02:57.500- 03:05.080* :  he should resign after what happened six months ago. The war started and the Hamas and everything.
*03:05.920- 03:11.180* :  He claimed that he wants to go to a war and make Hamas go away and bring all their
*03:11.180- 03:18.180* :  soldiers to a home back home. Unfortunately, it didn't achieve not the destruction of Hamas.
*03:18.880- 03:25.580* :  We still have 133 soldiers in Gaza. I hope they're in Gaza. I hope they're alive.
*03:25.920- 03:32.620* :  The protest comes after the body of Elad Katsir, a 47-year-old farmer who was abducted from a
*03:32.620- 03:38.880* :  kibbutz on October 7th last year, was recovered by Israeli special forces in Khan Yunus and Gaza.
*03:39.560- 03:42.580* :  I heard more from our correspondent in Jerusalem, Hugo Bashayev.
*03:43.040- 03:49.420* :  The sister of this man whose body was found has written a very angry post on Facebook,
*03:50.100- 03:55.120* :  essentially blaming the Israeli government for her brother's death. She says he could have been
*03:55.120- 04:00.360* :  brought back alive if the government had negotiated a deal with Hamas. I think this is a snapshot
*04:02.100- 04:07.500* :  of how the relatives, the friends of the hostages feel right now.
*04:08.000- 04:13.520* :  They are very angry, especially with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I've interviewed several
*04:13.520- 04:20.360* :  relatives and friends of hostages since those people were kidnapped in October and most of them
*04:20.360- 04:25.940* :  have the same message. They believe that the government has made the release of the hostages
*04:26.300- 04:31.780* :  a priority and many believe that the Prime Minister is only interested in his political
*04:31.780- 04:39.560* :  survival and the families demand a deal. The Prime Minister says that military pressure will force
*04:39.560- 04:43.740* :  Hamas to negotiate, but the families say that this strategy hasn't really worked,
*04:43.740- 04:49.040* :  that this only puts the hostages at risk, so there is a lot of pressure on the government to
*04:49.040- 04:54.700* :  negotiate, but there is a lot of anger. People are really, you know, dispared because they believe
*04:54.700- 04:58.360* :  that the government is not doing enough to guarantee the release of this hostages.
*04:58.960- 05:04.940* :  And Sunday marks six months since those Hamas attacks in Israel, and there's a lot of pressure
*05:04.940- 05:09.740* :  on the military strategy of Benjamin Netanyahu as well, isn't it?
*05:10.720- 05:17.120* :  Exactly, and I think, you know, patience was already running out with the Israelis and the way
*05:17.120- 05:23.280* :  the Israeli military has been conducting this war against Hamas in Gaza, more than 33,000
*05:23.280- 05:28.280* :  Palestinians have been killed, according to the local authorities. There is a massive humanitarian
*05:28.280- 05:34.780* :  crisis that only gets worse, and then we had the attack on the aid convoy that, you know,
*05:34.780- 05:41.780* :  has sparked widespread condemnation, some countries talking about weapons bans to Israel, so
*05:42.120- 05:48.340* :  the authorities are under a lot of pressure from, you know, some of the country's closest allies,
*05:48.960- 05:54.400* :  and in particular, the United States, I think it was, you know, very significant, the phone call
*05:54.400- 05:59.200* :  that happened between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, in which essentially
*05:59.200- 06:03.420* :  President Biden said, if you don't change course, we're going to change our position.
*06:04.020- 06:09.960* :  There is a lot of pressure now for a ceasefire to be negotiated, so we now know that Hamas is
*06:09.960- 06:16.180* :  sending a delegation to Cairo on Sunday for talks for a ceasefire. The Egyptians and the Qataris
*06:16.180- 06:21.820* :  have been acting as mediators. We understand that the head of CIA is expected to join those talks
*06:21.820- 06:28.140* :  in Cairo, and any kind of deal would see the release of hostages in return for Palestinians being
*06:28.140- 06:33.680* :  held in Israeli jails, and also a humanitarian pause that would allow more humanitarian aid
*06:34.000- 06:38.760* :  to be delivered to Palestinians in Gaza. But these are very difficult negotiations, and we still
*06:38.760- 06:44.140* :  don't know whether, you know, several of the obstacles that existed in these negotiations have
*06:44.140- 06:49.140* :  been resolved. Hugo Bashayka, well, as we just heard, it is six months to the day since the
*06:49.140- 06:55.480* :  October 7th attacks carried out in southern Israel by Hamas, which killed about 1,100 people.
*06:56.320- 07:01.080* :  Hamas is regarded as a terrorist group by many Western governments. Our Chief International
*07:01.080- 07:06.200* :  Correspondent leaves to set has been to meet Israelis and Palestinians to discuss the
*07:06.200- 07:13.600* :  continuing impact of the war in Gaza. We're here in a small agricultural community in southern
*07:13.600- 07:19.360* :  Israel where the butterflies are flitting in the flowers, but we can see the bombing too.
*07:20.020- 07:26.160* :  Gaza is so close that the plumes of black smoke are rising on the horizon. You can hear a war
*07:26.160- 07:32.700* :  plane in the sky. And the boundary fence is almost within touching distance, and it was there in the
*07:32.700- 07:40.740* :  early hours of Saturday, October 7th, that this crisis began when Hamas fighters breached that barrier
*07:40.740- 07:48.240* :  and went on a rampage, including here. My name is Hilaf-Fenlon from an agricultural community
*07:48.240- 07:54.940* :  on the border of Gaza, called Netif-Asara. So we're inside, there's 30 bunkers, you can hear the echo.
*07:54.940- 08:00.880* :  What's the place? Supposed to keep people safe. Yeah, and an elderly woman by the name of Havika,
*08:00.880- 08:06.460* :  79-year-old woman. She was just walking on the street when all the rockets started before,
*08:06.760- 08:11.500* :  and she entered the security room just to be safe from the rockets, and the tourists spotted
*08:11.500- 08:17.300* :  there and followed her inside, and they shatter nine times. And you can see it here behind us.
*08:17.620- 08:21.220* :  Oh, we can see the other... Oh, the two pictures.
*08:21.220- 08:27.160* :  So you're just standing near the poles. We were with my children and my partner children
*08:27.700- 08:33.920* :  locked in a shelter for 12 hours without electricity and no reception, and the terrorists were
*08:33.920- 08:41.040* :  stopped in the evening by soldiers that finally arrived. Four of them were arrested or stopped.
*08:41.700- 08:45.980* :  Two houses down my house. So it's been, it would have been another 10 or 15 minutes before
*08:45.980- 08:51.700* :  they would have been into my house as well. Gaza is so close, we can see it, the fence just runs
*08:51.700- 08:58.620* :  so close to here. The war goes on on the other side. Do you follow what's happening there,
*08:58.620- 09:04.740* :  and the suffering of gas and civilians? I feel sorry that we are in this situation,
*09:04.880- 09:10.460* :  I feel sorry for them, and I also feel sorry for us, we didn't ask for it, we didn't attack
*09:10.480- 09:16.360* :  ourselves, we were attacked. We are living next to a terror organisation that not only did what
*09:16.360- 09:20.900* :  it did, also said they'll do it again, so we need to make sure it will not happen again.
*09:22.740- 09:28.720* :  About 10 miles away, still so close to Gaza, aside from the occasional cry of a crow,
*09:29.440- 09:36.100* :  their silence, and it's absolutely chilling. This was the site of the Nova Music Festival,
*09:36.100- 09:43.380* :  where a place of celebration turned into scenes of absolute carnage, and now everywhere you look
*09:44.040- 09:49.640* :  in the shade of these eucalyptus trees, there are the photographs, the banners of young,
*09:49.740- 09:59.640* :  smiling Israelis, more than 370 were killed here by Hamas and other fighters, more than 40
*10:00.240- 10:06.360* :  taken across the wire into Gaza, and now the memorial to what happened that day.
*10:20.020- 10:26.060* :  My name is David, I feel very, very, very bad with the situation, I look in all the time for peace,
*10:26.920- 10:30.700* :  and all the time we have the fight, I'm not believe anymore with the peace.
*10:31.240- 10:36.060* :  Here at this main roundabout in the Tel Aviv, people are gathered all around this fountain,
*10:36.060- 10:42.520* :  sitting on the grass, on the park benches, all the rhythms of life seem to be slowly returning,
*10:42.540- 10:47.980* :  but it's not the same, all around this fountain, there's not one space that's empty,
*10:48.740- 10:56.100* :  photographs of the hostages, teddy bears, candles, flowers, and so many more Israeli flags.
*10:57.060- 11:00.680* :  So many Israelis tell us, this is a different country now.
*11:01.780- 11:03.500* :  How has your life changed since then?
*11:03.740- 11:10.340* :  It's just changing my feelings, I feel it's like anxiety, it's not so easy for me to like go out,
*11:10.340- 11:16.540* :  have drinks, just do the normal things, because I constantly think about the situation,
*11:16.620- 11:18.220* :  and the people who still suffer.
*11:18.540- 11:23.300* :  Would you like the war to end, because Israeli suffered now gossens, they're suffering enormously?
*11:23.480- 11:29.040* :  It's very painful for me that there's not enough stress here on what's happening on the other side,
*11:29.040- 11:32.820* :  I think in the media, there's not enough exposure.
*11:33.320- 11:40.580* :  This is the main street, and the main city, main Palestinian city, in the occupied West Bank.
*11:40.580- 11:44.820* :  Foreign journalists aren't allowed to go to Gaza to report there,
*11:45.380- 11:51.340* :  so we've come here to get a sense of what Palestinians are saying, and how their lives have changed
*11:51.340- 11:55.580* :  by this war in Gaza, it's been 60 miles away.
*11:58.400- 11:59.120* :  My name is Alex.
*11:59.620- 12:06.000* :  Alex, how is the October 7th war in Gaza affected your own life here in Ramallah?
*12:06.980- 12:13.360* :  It has some effect, we have just gotten used to so many that so many wars over the years,
*12:13.360- 12:16.020* :  you just eventually get numb to it.
*12:16.200- 12:20.580* :  Like every day I hear some people are dying, some people are dying, at first it used to get to me,
*12:20.580- 12:25.800* :  but now it's just more like it's something that I hear in passing, and that is honestly devastating
*12:25.800- 12:30.600* :  when you have to think about it, because people dying every day in the hundreds, people starving to death,
*12:30.800- 12:36.280* :  it's not something that you should be able to just ignore, but a lot of people here are just
*12:36.700- 12:41.300* :  just simply capable of living with it as a fact, because there's just nothing we can actually do
*12:41.300- 12:48.300* :  about it. Do you think this war will make it harder to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians?
*12:49.540- 12:53.520* :  I don't think it's the war, mostly that's going to be affecting the peace process, it's mostly
*12:53.520- 12:58.880* :  the world's views and the views of the Jewish people and the Israelis, the way that people are now
*12:58.880- 13:04.080* :  considered antisemitic for opposing Israel when they're opposing the genocide, not the religion
*13:04.080- 13:07.580* :  itself, but it is a political ploy by the Israeli people.
*13:08.460- 13:11.940* :  Did you have any sympathy for Israel during the October 7th attack?
*13:12.740- 13:16.640* :  I've had some sympathies for the civilians, but not really for the military.
*13:16.640- 13:19.180* :  When I put your name, Di'ala, I'm 21.
*13:19.780- 13:26.020* :  Do you think after what's happened that it's still possible for Israelis and Palestinians to end
*13:26.020- 13:30.580* :  these wars, achieve peace? I don't think so, I think everyone sees from their own point of view,
*13:30.820- 13:36.580* :  and they will never see from the other side. I mean, even to settle it, it's not even possible,
*13:36.580- 13:39.860* :  I don't think. There's always going to be war, there's always going to be someone fighting for
*13:39.860- 13:46.600* :  their own land, I guess, if they think it is. What could change it? I think when other people
*13:46.600- 13:52.560* :  around the world join in and really see that what's going on is wrong, that it's genocide,
*13:53.220- 13:58.080* :  not the only way that it can actually change anything. This is well-denised, but of course it's fine.
*13:58.260- 14:02.900* :  Yeah, and the rest of the world does because they only see what the news allows them to see.
*14:04.100- 14:07.520* :  That report by Lees DuSet, our chief international correspondent.
*14:08.440- 14:14.180* :  The head of NATO says Western governments are facing an authoritarian alliance comprised of
*14:14.180- 14:19.180* :  Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, which is working ever more closely together.
*14:19.760- 14:24.900* :  Jens Stoltenberg also said North Korea was sending enormous amounts of ammunition in support
*14:24.900- 14:31.240* :  of President Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine. Mr. Stoltenberg went on to say that NATO and
*14:31.240- 14:37.480* :  other Western countries must be resolute. China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, there are more and more
*14:37.480- 14:43.500* :  aligned, they support each other more and more, also many practical ways, and that makes it even more
*14:43.500- 14:49.260* :  important and like-minded countries, NATO allies, but also our partners in the Asia-Pacific, that we
*14:49.260- 14:54.000* :  also work more closely together, and that's exactly what we do to stand up against these
*14:54.000- 15:00.680* :  alliance of authoritarian powers. Grant Ferret has more details on the significance of Mr. Stoltenberg's
*15:01.020- 15:06.920* :  comments. At the end of a week in which NATO marked its 75th anniversary, Jens Stoltenberg outlined
*15:06.920- 15:11.940* :  the challenge it now faced. He said President Vladimir Putin's government, along with Beijing,
*15:11.940- 15:17.840* :  Tehran, and Pyongyang, were working ever more closely, sharing technology and military equipment.
*15:18.560- 15:23.640* :  Mr. Stoltenberg said China was propping up what he called Russia's war economy, with North
*15:23.640- 15:29.540* :  Korea sending enormous amounts of ammunition and Iran supplying drones. He said NATO's response
*15:29.540- 15:35.040* :  was not only to strengthen the alliance, but to work with partners outside its traditional scope,
*15:35.040- 15:40.200* :  including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. Grant Ferret.
*15:41.380- 15:46.900* :  Tens of thousands of people have taken part in a big anti-government rally in the Hungarian capital
*15:46.900- 15:53.360* :  Budapest. The demonstration was held by Peter Magyar, who is emerged as a challenger to the
*15:53.400- 15:57.260* :  Prime Minister, Victor Orban. From Budapest, Nick Thorke reports.
*16:00.600- 16:05.640* :  In warm spring weather, supporters of Peter Magyars stand up Hungarian's movement,
*16:05.640- 16:11.920* :  marched on Parliament. They include both dissolutioned former Fidesz voters and disappointed
*16:11.920- 16:18.360* :  supporters of the six main opposition parties. The latest opinion poll suggests that Peter Magyars
*16:18.360- 16:24.920* :  new party, even before its founded, is already the third force in Hungarian politics. The challenge now
*16:24.920- 16:31.180* :  for Peter Magyar and his rapidly expanding movement is to channel widespread anger with corruption
*16:31.180- 16:37.240* :  and the centralisation of power under Victor Orban into a party which could threaten Fidesz
*16:37.520- 16:44.180* :  in the next elections. Nick Thorke. Now to Slovakia, which has been holding a presidential election
*16:44.180- 16:49.500* :  runoff, that could be described as a contest between those who support the West and those who
*16:49.500- 16:55.640* :  favour the Kremlin. The two candidates for the largely ceremonial but influential post are the
*16:55.640- 17:01.760* :  pro-Western former diplomat Ivan Korczok and Peter Pellegrini, the candidate of the populist
*17:01.760- 17:05.480* :  nationalist government. Our correspondent Rob Cameron told me what happened.
*17:05.940- 17:12.060* :  Well, the latest is that Peter Pellegrini has very much been elected the next president of Slovakia.
*17:12.460- 17:18.040* :  We haven't got all the results in yet but it now seems clear with about 1995 percent
*17:18.920- 17:23.800* :  of constituencies returning their ballots combined with these mathematical
*17:23.900- 17:29.400* :  modellings that new servers do these days. It's now quite clear that Peter Pellegrini
*17:29.400- 17:36.480* :  has been elected as the new president of Slovakia to replace the liberal president Zuzana
*17:36.480- 17:42.060* :  Chaputtava who has decided not to seek re-election after receiving what she says was a
*17:42.060- 17:48.520* :  torrent of abuse and death threats, including from some of the supporters of the government of
*17:48.520- 17:55.280* :  which Mr Pellegrini is a part, so a sense really of the atmosphere in Slovak politics and society
*17:55.280- 17:59.940* :  at the moment. I said this is largely ceremonial position but it's influential in what way?
*18:00.620- 18:06.400* :  It's very influential. One chief reason I think is that Slovakia, unlike other countries
*18:06.400- 18:12.720* :  in the region such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia only has one house of parliament so the
*18:12.720- 18:19.140* :  president plays a really an outsized role and we saw that actually with President Chaputtava
*18:19.500- 18:24.800* :  who is very much in opposition to some of the things that's the populist nationalist government
*18:24.800- 18:31.080* :  of Robert Fizor is trying to push through in Slovakia. He's really taken a wrecking ball to
*18:31.260- 18:37.320* :  Slovakia's criminal justice system and now has his sights set on the public broadcaster
*18:37.660- 18:44.420* :  but she actually succeeded in blocking some of those changes to the penal code by sending them
*18:44.420- 18:51.060* :  to the constitutional court and only she has the right to do that. So Mr Fizor has been blocked
*18:51.060- 18:58.700* :  to a degree in his ambitions to change the criminal justice system in Slovakia and the big worry is
*18:58.700- 19:05.940* :  that Peter Pellegrini who is an ally of Robert Fizor and is in one of the parties in his
*19:05.940- 19:11.900* :  government that he won't play that blocking role. He won't be that ballwalk against Mr Fizor's
*19:11.900- 19:19.600* :  attempts to create what his critics say is a vision of an illiberal democracy in Slovakia
*19:19.600- 19:25.960* :  perhaps along the lines inspired by Viktor Orbán's Hungary. Rob Cameron, there are some events
*19:25.960- 19:31.520* :  which seem to happen without much warning and then there are solar eclipses. The one due to
*19:31.520- 19:36.180* :  take place on Monday was actually predicted more than a hundred years ago and yet people are
*19:36.180- 19:41.380* :  apparently still trying to work at how they'll get to one of the spots in the US, Mexico and Canada
*19:41.960- 19:47.080* :  where they'll be able to see it, not to mention, well they'll stay once they arrive. Many are expected
*19:47.080- 19:53.460* :  to head to New York State where officials like Jessica De Cess has spent the past year preparing
*19:53.460- 19:59.280* :  for this influx. We are so excited for New York State to be in the path, you know this is the
*19:59.280- 20:04.020* :  first time in 99 years and it's going to be the last time for the next one I think that will be
*20:04.020- 20:10.940* :  viewable in New York State is 2079 so this is a once in a lifetime experience. It's hard to predict
*20:10.940- 20:16.300* :  how many people are going to be here but anecdotally we've heard from all of the hotels are booked,
*20:16.300- 20:21.160* :  all of the Airbnb's are booked and it was amazing to me once I started researching that people come
*20:21.160- 20:26.280* :  from all over the world to view these. I've seen descriptions of people describing this is a
*20:26.280- 20:32.540* :  very spiritual experience. The traffic is a main concern. There were some states that experienced
*20:32.540- 20:39.280* :  a total solar eclipse in 2017 and there was a lot of traffic overload so even though they and we
*20:39.280- 20:43.720* :  have been telling people to come for the eclipse but stay here for a couple of days and experience
*20:43.720- 20:49.560* :  our great New York State people tended to get on the road right after and that caused a lot of
*20:49.560- 20:54.500* :  backups. The other thing is that we don't and we've been messaging this really really a lot.
*20:54.520- 21:00.640* :  I don't pull over on the side of the road to watch this eclipse. That's dangerous so we want
*21:00.640- 21:05.460* :  everyone to follow all the traffic laws and rules to make sure that we don't end up with pile-ups
*21:05.460- 21:13.280* :  on the roadways. Jessica to six. Still to come. The first wolf was spotted in Switzerland in 2012.
*21:13.280- 21:19.380* :  There are now believed to be more than 300 roaming the Alpine nation as part of 32 packs.
*21:19.380- 21:25.420* :  Now in a sign of protest, Swiss farmers have dumped the borders of a dozen sheep killed by the
*21:25.420- 21:28.440* :  predators in front of a government building in Los Angeles.

*23:03.460- 23:05.340* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*23:06.640- 23:12.680* :  Now to Ecuador. And a huge row is developing in Latin America over the storming of the Mexican
*23:12.680- 23:18.960* :  embassy in Keto. That's a capital of Ecuador. Armed police search the complex and sees the
*23:18.960- 23:23.660* :  form of vice president of Ecuador who's been sheltering their since December. It's virtually
*23:23.660- 23:28.560* :  unheard of to enter the diplomatic mission of another country, which is considered to be sovereign
*23:28.560- 23:35.360* :  territory. Both Mexico and Nicaragua have severed diplomatic ties with Ecuador. The Mexican
*23:35.360- 23:44.320* :  foreign minister is Alicia Barsena. Mexico announces the immediate suspension of diplomatic relations
*23:44.320- 23:50.540* :  with Ecuador. In this sense, our diplomatic personnel in Ecuador will leave the country immediately.
*23:51.380- 23:55.640* :  We urge Ecuador to offer the necessary guarantees for the departing personnel.
*23:56.440- 24:01.720* :  Mexico will appeal to the International Court of Justice to hold Ecuador accountable for
*24:01.720- 24:07.000* :  violations of international law. Other Latin American countries like Brazil, Colombia,
*24:07.000- 24:12.580* :  and Argentina have condemned the raid. I spoke to our Latin America regional editor, Leonardo
*24:12.580- 24:18.580* :  Rosha, who's in Miami. So what's behind this row? Why did Ecuador invade Mexico's embassy?
*24:19.120- 24:24.780* :  Why was the former vice president there? Well, I find interesting is that before this
*24:25.160- 24:31.620* :  operation, the Mexican president had said that he wouldn't basically break relations with Ecuador.
*24:31.620- 24:37.120* :  The relations were damaged for a while, but he was trying to keep it going. So no one really
*24:37.120- 24:43.280* :  expected them to enter the embassy. What happened is in December, Jorge Glass entered the embassy.
*24:43.620- 24:47.920* :  He'd served a sentence for corruption, which he denies. He said the allegations are political.
*24:47.920- 24:53.860* :  He served four years, and then in December, a court ordered him to go back to jail.
*24:54.220- 24:59.760* :  And when he heard that, he went into the embassy, the Mexican embassy. You have a center-right
*24:59.760- 25:06.080* :  government now in Ecuador, and you have a center-left government in Mexico. And Jorge Glass is
*25:06.080- 25:12.260* :  basically, he was the vice president of Rafael Correa. He's a very strong powerful force,
*25:12.260- 25:17.200* :  the main force of the left wing in Ecuador. He's also an exile. So he had this whole thing
*25:17.200- 25:22.380* :  division between left and right accusations of corruption. And he entered the embassy,
*25:22.380- 25:29.120* :  and thought he was safe there. But basically, Ecuador, the government of President Norboa
*25:29.340- 25:34.020* :  wasn't allowing him to go until this operation happened. It took everyone by surprise.
*25:34.240- 25:38.280* :  Interesting. So it seems sensible for this vice president to go into the Mexican embassy.
*25:38.280- 25:43.100* :  It's a left wing government in Mexico at the moment. So they assumed they were safe there.
*25:43.100- 25:47.980* :  That is not the case. This has now caused a huge row across Latin America, hasn't it?
*25:48.240- 25:52.200* :  Do you think it is over the principle of the sovereignty of an embassy?
*25:52.200- 25:58.740* :  I think so, because, as you mentioned before, you had Venezuela, Colombia, the left-wing
*25:58.740- 26:04.320* :  governments in the region, Brazil, Nicaragua. They were very quick to condemn what happened there.
*26:04.640- 26:10.700* :  But then Argentina, with Javier Milé, who is a very close ally of the Ecuadorian government,
*26:10.700- 26:16.820* :  he is describing himself as a libertarian and anti-communist. He also issued a statement saying
*26:16.820- 26:23.460* :  it violates the principle of diplomacy. Also, if a country decides to give political asylum
*26:23.460- 26:28.160* :  to another country, you're expected to respect that, or at least not to storm the embassy.
*26:28.500- 26:33.720* :  I think Latin American politics is going through a stage where people are saying things that
*26:33.720- 26:39.720* :  they shouldn't be saying. Presidents are calling names, and it's going to a very dangerous path
*26:39.720- 26:44.340* :  because of this left and right division across the continent. Leonardo Russia
*26:45.180- 26:51.540* :  is the military junta in Myanmar losing its grip on power. It opposed the democratically
*26:51.540- 26:56.220* :  elected government three years ago, and since then, a number of armed groups have tried to fight
*26:56.220- 27:01.440* :  back. It's been an uphill struggle. They've been hugely outnumbered and outgunned.
*27:01.940- 27:06.580* :  But now, Myanmar's military government is coming at a serious pressure from opposition forces.
*27:07.140- 27:12.680* :  They've lost control along parts of the border with India and China, and now the busiest
*27:12.680- 27:19.100* :  border crossing into Thailand, through which much of Myanmar's trade passes. I heard more from
*27:19.100- 27:24.120* :  our correspondent in the region, Jonathan Head. Well, it looks pretty clear now that the military
*27:24.120- 27:30.160* :  junta has lost complete control of what is probably the most important border crossing,
*27:30.220- 27:35.080* :  while one of the two, the other ones up in China, for Myanmar, I mean a huge amount of Myanmar's
*27:35.080- 27:40.340* :  trade goes through this border town, Miyawadi. In fact, much more than you'd expect,
*27:40.340- 27:46.460* :  because Myanmar has very poor port facilities, so a great many manufacturers there and traders
*27:46.460- 27:53.140* :  go through Miyawadi into Thailand and trade out that way. This town has not been in insertion
*27:53.140- 27:58.920* :  control for many decades, and now they've got it. I mean, they're negotiating, as we understand it,
*27:58.920- 28:04.780* :  the surrender of the last military battalion that's based there, but the battalion commanders
*28:05.440- 28:09.620* :  have said they want to surrender. It's just about terms, and they've already accepted the surrender
*28:09.660- 28:15.420* :  of hundreds more, more than 600 soldiers on Friday at a town nearby. It was a very big military post
*28:15.960- 28:19.980* :  and captured a great deal of military equipment with it, which I'm sure they'll find very useful.
*28:20.620- 28:25.160* :  So it's a serious blow, and this is a military regime that has already lost significant
*28:25.160- 28:31.280* :  swathes of territory up north on its border with China in the last few months, and to the west
*28:31.340- 28:36.220* :  and its border with Bangladesh. These are very significant losses. It's not something that the
*28:36.220- 28:41.260* :  Myanmar military has ever experienced before. So given this is not a one-off if you like, and it's
*28:41.260- 28:50.040* :  significant in terms of trade, is it a sign that the junta is losing control of larger and larger
*28:50.040- 28:56.700* :  areas? It is, but it will take a long time, I imagine, for there to be a real swing against them,
*28:56.700- 29:02.100* :  a real shift in the power balance. I mean, they still control the big cities, Yangon,
*29:02.100- 29:07.480* :  Mandalay, and the capital Nipidor, which is more or less a military fortress, although we did
*29:07.480- 29:13.040* :  see that being attacked by drones fluent by the opposition earlier this week. So they're vulnerable
*29:13.040- 29:17.600* :  even there. Everyone's calculating at the moment, you know, these blows are unprecedented for the
*29:17.600- 29:22.180* :  Myanmar military. They're not able to rally enough troops to fight back. They're struggling with
*29:22.180- 29:27.500* :  recruitment. They've now enforced conscription. That's causing lots of young people to flee.
*29:27.500- 29:33.540* :  It does look like a regime that is unraveling, but I think realistically, the military leaders know
*29:33.540- 29:37.880* :  that they're loathed by the rest of the country. They've got nowhere else to go. They won't give
*29:37.880- 29:43.820* :  up easily, so it's going to be a very long haul to overturn the military regime in Nipidor,
*29:43.820- 29:49.760* :  but these kinds of losses suggest that that is where we're heading. I can't imagine how they can
*29:49.760- 29:55.940* :  continue to sustain these losses and not see morale collapse, and it's already very badly damaged
*29:55.940- 30:02.500* :  in the ranks. Jonathan Hade, Swiss farmers have dumped the borders of a dozen sheep in front of
*30:02.500- 30:08.340* :  a government building in Los Angeles. They say the animals were killed at night by wolves, and
*30:08.340- 30:13.980* :  they want the predators culled. Nikki Cardwell has a story. The first wolf was spotted in Switzerland
*30:13.980- 30:21.060* :  in 2012. There are now believed to be more than 300 roaming the Alpine nation as part of 32 packs.
*30:21.100- 30:26.860* :  Conservationists say it's a sign of a healthy and diverse ecosystem, but the farmers say they're
*30:26.860- 30:31.400* :  sheep are being attacked regularly, and they need something to be done to bring numbers of the
*30:31.400- 30:36.260* :  predators down. The Swiss government has already relaxed hunting laws to permit the killing of
*30:36.260- 30:42.880* :  problem wolves, which are known to have attacked livestock. But in 2020, a referendum rejected plans
*30:42.880- 30:48.280* :  to remove their protected status. Environmental groups are fighting attempts to introduce a wider
*30:48.280- 30:56.620* :  cull through the Swiss courts. Nikki Cardwell, Elvis Presley had Graceland. Dolly Parton has Dollywood.
*30:56.620- 31:02.820* :  The British pop star Harry Styles has a railway arch in a wet field in the middle of Northern England.
*31:02.820- 31:08.260* :  But despite that, thousands of fans from around the world known as Harry's have flocked to the
*31:08.260- 31:14.380* :  sleepy village where the singer grew up. And now the community are recruiting a tour guide to show
*31:14.380- 31:20.100* :  them all around. Reginald Wright reports. Harry Styles is one of the best-selling and best-known
*31:20.100- 31:26.240* :  male singers in the world. According to Billboard magazine, his song As It Was became the global number
*31:26.240- 31:33.360* :  one song of 2022. And certainly his home village of Holmes Chapel in the county of Cheshire has never
*31:33.360- 31:38.480* :  been the same since Harry's career took off. Harry Styles' fans, known as Harry's,
*31:38.700- 31:44.860* :  make their pop pilgrimage to the 180-year-old tremolo viaduct. A railway bridge where Harry Styles
*31:44.860- 31:50.380* :  repeatedly had his first kiss and signed his name on one of the archers. Peter Wears, a local
*31:50.380- 31:55.680* :  retired engineer, says he's worried that one of the golf fans could be mone down on a fast road.
*31:56.000- 32:02.400* :  So what we did was produce a map, get them off a busy road, actually dance a nice country lane,
*32:02.400- 32:08.140* :  and then across the fields to the what is the tremolo viaduct. And last year, Peter says they
*32:08.140- 32:14.040* :  printed 5,000 maps, which is why they're recruiting for a local tour guide to show the girls around.
*32:14.060- 32:18.900* :  The new tours, which will begin in June, will start at the Holmes Chapel railway station,
*32:18.900- 32:22.840* :  and then go to the bakery where Harry Styles worked before he hit the big time.
*32:22.840- 32:27.120* :  Peter Wears says it's not always that easy for the fans who travel a long way,
*32:27.120- 32:31.800* :  and on their walk to the railway bridge have to deal with frisky cows, a strange kissing gates,
*32:31.800- 32:33.580* :  and well, the British weather.
*32:33.880- 32:40.860* :  A lot of them have come a long way. Australia, Japan, Peru, you name it. They're coming on a
*32:40.860- 32:45.160* :  sort of homage to Holmes Chapel. They'll meet Simon if he's in the owner of the bakery.
*32:45.160- 32:50.280* :  They'll go down to the viaduct, but you know, this is Chesha, so it does rain rather a lot,
*32:50.380- 32:52.800* :  and there's only so long you can stand out in a wet field.
*32:53.080- 32:57.480* :  According to Mr Wear, there've been incidents with girls and tight white jeans limping back to
*32:57.480- 33:01.320* :  the village covered in mud. But for most of the visitors who sign their names,
*33:01.320- 33:04.620* :  alongside Harry's on the railway arch, it seems worth it.
*33:04.720- 33:09.260* :  One of our local shops has just decided to put a map on and start putting pins in,
*33:09.380- 33:13.840* :  because we just never cease to be amazed at the distances that people are traveling.
*33:13.840- 33:20.280* :  We do get lots of UK Harry's as well. Two girls from Liverpool and now come every two weeks.
*33:20.760- 33:25.520* :  And for the residents of this small English village, things will never be the same as it was.
*33:26.080- 33:27.680* :  That report by Rachel White.
*33:29.300- 33:33.640* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
