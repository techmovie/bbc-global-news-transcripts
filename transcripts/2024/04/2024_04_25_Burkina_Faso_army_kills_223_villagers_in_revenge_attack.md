*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*00:30.740- 00:32.320* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.

*01:10.560- 01:14.700* :  I'm Andrew Peachan at 13 hours GMT on Thursday, the 25th of April.
*01:14.700- 01:16.040* :  These are our main stories.
*01:16.660- 01:21.860* :  Human Rights Watch accuses the army in Bikina Faso of massacring more than 200 villages
*01:22.180- 01:23.000* :  in a single day.
*01:23.640- 01:27.480* :  The US Secretary of State is in Beijing as the world's largest economy is trying to
*01:27.480- 01:29.040* :  mend their strained relationship.
*01:29.760- 01:33.260* :  Israel says it's still planning a ground operation in southern Gaza.
*01:35.740- 01:36.760* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:36.760- 01:40.480* :  the whole world comes here to take pictures of the Moulin Rouge.
*01:41.180- 01:45.460* :  I think that the owners will do their utmost to re-install the sales quickly.
*01:45.920- 01:47.960* :  It's like the Eiffel Tower falling down.
*01:48.120- 01:52.640* :  Mystery in Paris as the Moulin Rouge loses the sales its windmill overnight.
*01:56.620- 02:01.100* :  For almost a decade now, the authorities in the landlocked African-State of Bikina Faso
*02:01.440- 02:05.700* :  have been battling an Islamist insurgency with devastating consequences for the country.
*02:06.280- 02:09.600* :  Thousands of people have died, more than two million have been displaced.
*02:09.620- 02:13.040* :  The military government, which came into power two years ago in a coup,
*02:13.040- 02:17.500* :  has been accused of targeting civilians in their campaign against Islamist fighters.
*02:18.020- 02:22.240* :  The extent to the violence has been highlighted in a report by Human Rights Watch.
*02:22.260- 02:25.280* :  Africa editor Richard Hamilton has been telling me more.
*02:25.700- 02:26.880* :  It is absolutely shocking.
*02:26.880- 02:30.940* :  They're saying that on the 25th of February, in one single day,
*02:30.980- 02:36.140* :  the army from Bikina Faso killed 223 civilians,
*02:36.140- 02:40.500* :  including at least 56 children, including babies.
*02:41.300- 02:43.780* :  These attacks occurred in two villages,
*02:43.780- 02:45.600* :  called Sorro and Nondin.
*02:46.360- 02:49.800* :  And Human Rights Watch has described these mass killings as
*02:49.980- 02:54.640* :  among the worst army abuses in the country in nearly 10 years.
*02:55.480- 03:00.080* :  Villagers who survived, their eyewitnesses told the rights organization
*03:00.160- 03:03.260* :  that a military convoy of more than 100 soldiers,
*03:03.600- 03:06.940* :  some in motorbikes, descended on the first village
*03:07.900- 03:10.820* :  about half an hour after jihadists had been in the area.
*03:10.820- 03:15.000* :  The soldiers went door to door, pulling residents out of their homes,
*03:15.480- 03:17.680* :  rounding them up and opening fire on them.
*03:18.140- 03:22.460* :  They then did the same in the next village about five kilometers away.
*03:23.160- 03:28.140* :  And in both places, the soldiers also shot at those who attempted to flee.
*03:28.800- 03:32.960* :  Now, these mass killings are believed to be in retaliation by the military,
*03:32.960- 03:38.040* :  which accused the villagers of aiding and abetting these Islamist militants.
*03:38.040- 03:42.040* :  And it followed an attack by jihadists on a nearby military camp
*03:42.440- 03:44.480* :  in the same province, which is called Yatenga.
*03:44.980- 03:50.200* :  So a terrible, terrible toll, and it's only just really coming to full light at the moment.
*03:50.320- 03:53.020* :  Yes, I was going to ask you about that. It's not the most important part of the story,
*03:53.020- 03:54.500* :  but listeners might want to be thinking,
*03:54.980- 03:57.160* :  how is it possible for something like this to have happened
*03:57.280- 03:59.120* :  and for nothing to have been known about it for two months?
*03:59.460- 04:04.020* :  That's right. It's partly because Human Rights Watch has been conducting a very
*04:04.020- 04:09.560* :  thorough investigation, and they didn't want to, you know, put any false news out there.
*04:09.560- 04:12.600* :  So they interviewed more than 20 survivors.
*04:12.600- 04:17.240* :  They verified videos and photos that were shared by eyewitnesses.
*04:17.440- 04:19.420* :  So they conducted a thorough investigation.
*04:19.820- 04:23.280* :  The other thing is that there's been Russian disinformation.
*04:23.540- 04:29.720* :  There's also, it was a very remote location, and people are scared about speaking out.
*04:30.240- 04:34.780* :  And finally, because of the international media's focus on, you know,
*04:34.780- 04:38.360* :  legitimately large stories like Ukraine and Gaza,
*04:38.860- 04:42.720* :  unfortunately, what happens in this obscure, remote,
*04:42.720- 04:46.880* :  landlocked African country doesn't hit the headlines until, of course,
*04:46.880- 04:51.820* :  either you get a terrorism incident closer to home in Europe or United States,
*04:51.820- 04:55.860* :  or you get people fleeing these sorts of African countries
*04:56.260- 04:57.740* :  and trying to get into Europe as well.
*04:57.740- 05:01.800* :  So that's when people wake up to the story, but often it's too late.
*05:01.800- 05:04.200* :  And that was our Africa editor, Richard Hamilton.
*05:04.980- 05:08.180* :  Relations between the United States and China really matter.
*05:08.180- 05:11.400* :  That's the message from the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken,
*05:11.700- 05:14.280* :  as he continues a closely watched visit to China.
*05:14.700- 05:17.880* :  He's been speaking about the need for direct engagement and said
*05:17.880- 05:21.160* :  China and the US must resolve their differences together.
*05:21.820- 05:24.720* :  After a day meeting business leaders and students in Shanghai,
*05:24.720- 05:29.180* :  Mr. Blinken has traveled to Beijing where talks are expected to get somewhat tougher.
*05:29.560- 05:31.760* :  Our China correspondent Laura Bicker has more.
*05:34.680- 05:40.400* :  The fast footsteps you can hear, and the studs of boots on the astroturf,
*05:42.600- 05:47.300* :  are young people warming up for a game you might not expect in China.
*05:48.180- 05:51.240* :  They're donning helmets, shoulder pads, knee pads,
*05:53.300- 05:56.240* :  and gearing up for a game of American football.
*05:57.040- 05:58.540* :  Yeah, there are teams.
*05:58.980- 06:00.140* :  Yeah, it's very hard.
*06:02.140- 06:05.700* :  And it's tough, physically and mentally.
*06:06.240- 06:08.940* :  It is very difficult to defeat yourself.
*06:09.460- 06:12.860* :  You can defeat the fear, you know.
*06:13.700- 06:16.840* :  Henry is the oldest player in the Beijing Cyclons.
*06:18.900- 06:22.780* :  This sport, which is an expression of America's national identity,
*06:23.260- 06:25.220* :  has made it to the capital of China.
*06:26.400- 06:28.080* :  Huo Huo Huo Huo.
*06:28.700- 06:32.740* :  There are only a few thousand players in the country but millions of fans.
*06:33.660- 06:39.660* :  It is very interesting to culture communicate through this game.
*06:40.660- 06:46.680* :  Chinese people play American sports and American people come to China.
*06:47.160- 06:54.020* :  They're very welcome to see each other to know each other,
*06:54.500- 06:56.580* :  to make friends with each other.
*06:57.280- 06:58.100* :  Yeah, peace, not war.
*07:00.400- 07:03.560* :  That's something that will be on the US Secretary of State's mind,
*07:04.020- 07:05.340* :  as he heads to Beijing.
*07:06.840- 07:09.560* :  In Shanghai, he met students and business leaders,
*07:10.080- 07:12.000* :  eight meat buns, and watched baseball.
*07:12.980- 07:15.700* :  But the tough conversations are still to come.
*07:16.360- 07:19.160* :  It's thought he may meet President Xi on Friday.
*07:20.080- 07:23.740* :  I think it's important to underscore the value, in fact,
*07:23.740- 07:28.840* :  the necessity of direct engagement, of sustained engagement,
*07:29.180- 07:33.280* :  of speaking to each other, laying out our differences,
*07:33.280- 07:35.580* :  which are real, seeking to work through them,
*07:36.060- 07:38.660* :  is also looking for ways to build cooperation where we can.
*07:40.540- 07:44.220* :  We have an obligation for our people and indeed,
*07:44.220- 07:47.540* :  an obligation for the world to manage the relationship between our two countries.
*07:48.000- 07:51.320* :  The talks are already off to a contentious start.
*07:51.320- 07:56.100* :  The US has announced more military aid for the self-governing island of Taiwan,
*07:56.660- 07:59.640* :  as fears grow, China will take it by force.
*08:00.280- 08:03.740* :  Beijing sees the island as its territory and as furious.
*08:09.000- 08:14.080* :  The US also believes China's exports to Russia are helping Moscow with its war effort.
*08:14.580- 08:16.860* :  An accusation Beijing says is groundless.
*08:17.360- 08:20.340* :  But Mr. Blinken will push for that trade to stop.
*08:23.780- 08:27.400* :  Back on the football field, their minds are on the sporting season,
*08:27.800- 08:29.140* :  not the political one.
*08:29.480- 08:30.360* :  You might need to ball.
*08:32.180- 08:35.200* :  Quarterback Mu Yang once commentated for Chinese fans
*08:35.240- 08:37.340* :  during a Super Bowl game in Los Angeles.
*08:38.060- 08:39.620* :  The biggest to game in the world.
*08:39.620- 08:44.440* :  I think more and the more the super star in the field come to China to support us,
*08:44.640- 08:48.100* :  to make some like the Trinian camp, to teach us how to play.
*08:48.100- 08:51.520* :  I live football. That's a good thing for us.
*08:51.860- 08:57.560* :  These are the kind of sporting exchanges both Beijing and Washington would like to see.
*08:58.240- 09:04.380* :  But superstars are more likely to come to China when the two superpowers find some common ground.
*09:06.060- 09:08.160* :  Our China correspondent Laura Bicca reporting.
*09:08.760- 09:12.160* :  Eight years in jail, that's the sentence for a Vietnamese businessman
*09:12.160- 09:14.600* :  convicted of a multi-million dollar fraud.
*09:14.600- 09:17.860* :  The case of Chun Quay Time, who runs a soft drinks business,
*09:17.860- 09:21.960* :  is the latest of a number of high-profile corruption trials in Vietnam.
*09:21.960- 09:25.800* :  I've found out more from Asia-Pacific regional editor Celia Hatton.
*09:26.280- 09:30.760* :  This is a man who actually built up a massive fizzy drink empire.
*09:30.760- 09:36.880* :  He was one of the biggest beverage sellers in Vietnam, made millions off of it.
*09:36.880- 09:42.900* :  And Chun Quay Time, though, he is downfall, really, has been property.
*09:42.900- 09:48.640* :  So he was found guilty of basically offering to lend people money,
*09:48.640- 09:54.860* :  but wanting their property as collateral in these loans that he was doing on the side,
*09:54.860- 09:56.820* :  alongside his two grown daughters.
*09:57.440- 10:00.460* :  When people would pay back the money owed and interest,
*10:01.080- 10:05.380* :  then Chun Quay Time and his daughters would refuse to hand back the property.
*10:05.380- 10:09.380* :  And so they built up a small property empire by doing this,
*10:09.420- 10:12.500* :  by basically defrauding people of their property.
*10:12.500- 10:15.940* :  And so that's why he's gone to prison for eight years.
*10:15.940- 10:18.160* :  His daughters as well for lesser sentences.
*10:18.400- 10:20.500* :  It's the context that's interesting here, isn't it?
*10:20.500- 10:25.800* :  The context of Vietnam going after some of these big fish and these big corruption cases?
*10:26.100- 10:27.500* :  Yeah, that's right. I mean, we have to remember,
*10:27.500- 10:33.320* :  this comes just a few weeks after we saw the biggest corruption case in Vietnam's history
*10:33.320- 10:36.620* :  come to a close. That's the case of Chun Min Lan.
*10:36.620- 10:40.500* :  She was also a billionaire luxury property developer
*10:40.500- 10:43.660* :  who defrauded a bank of more than $40 billion.
*10:44.080- 10:49.080* :  Now, the wider context to all of this is an ongoing anti-corruption campaign
*10:49.480- 10:51.280* :  taking place across Vietnam,
*10:51.860- 10:55.880* :  in which more than 4,000 people have been charged with criminal offenses.
*10:56.280- 10:59.700* :  We've already seen the downfall of two Vietnamese leaders because of this
*11:00.040- 11:04.280* :  countless entrepreneurs. And really, it's exposed this operation,
*11:04.340- 11:07.380* :  which is called blazing furnace, this ongoing campaign,
*11:07.380- 11:12.180* :  has really exposed how weak the banking rules have been in Vietnam,
*11:12.180- 11:15.100* :  how many bad property loans there are.
*11:15.440- 11:18.160* :  And there are some people who are thinking that if this continues,
*11:18.500- 11:22.000* :  this is really going to slow down the entire Vietnamese economy
*11:22.000- 11:26.460* :  because really it's exposing that this huge fast growing economy
*11:26.460- 11:28.560* :  that we thought was doing really, really well
*11:28.560- 11:31.800* :  has really been built on very, very shaky foundations.
*11:32.180- 11:34.480* :  Our Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Hatton.
*11:34.980- 11:38.920* :  The Moulin Rouge Cabaret Club has been a Paris landmark for more than 100 years,
*11:38.920- 11:41.540* :  but residents of the French capital work up on Thursday
*11:41.540- 11:45.380* :  to find the windmill on top of the club had lost its sales.
*11:47.780- 11:50.180* :  It's a symbol of Montmartre, of its village,
*11:50.700- 11:52.680* :  the bohemian way of life, of Paris.
*11:53.340- 11:56.540* :  The whole world comes here to take pictures of the Moulin Rouge.
*11:57.240- 12:01.520* :  I think that the owners will do their utmost to re-install the sales quickly
*12:02.060- 12:04.780* :  because even if it's just a sign that falls down,
*12:05.460- 12:09.520* :  it is the sign of Moulin Rouge, it's like the Eiffel Tower falling down.
*12:09.940- 12:12.040* :  The blades came off in the early hours of the morning,
*12:12.040- 12:13.580* :  falling onto the street below.
*12:13.580- 12:16.140* :  So what more do we know about what happened?
*12:16.140- 12:19.380* :  A question for our correspondent in Paris, Heesco Field.
*12:19.860- 12:24.240* :  What they seem to have done in a few hours since it happened is rule out foul play.
*12:24.640- 12:26.540* :  That's the latest from the police and the management,
*12:26.640- 12:28.600* :  but what happened was that in the middle of the night,
*12:28.600- 12:29.900* :  between two and three o'clock in the morning,
*12:30.280- 12:32.460* :  the four blades or sales.
*12:32.460- 12:34.780* :  I mean, they didn't function, they were just decorative,
*12:34.780- 12:36.520* :  but they were the blades of the windmill,
*12:36.520- 12:39.240* :  which is very obviously there above Plas Pigal.
*12:39.340- 12:40.860* :  They fell off and they were found on the road
*12:40.860- 12:44.120* :  with the letters of the Moulin, the first to less than Moulin,
*12:44.120- 12:46.120* :  MOU, also having come off.
*12:46.480- 12:47.760* :  It wasn't particularly windy night.
*12:47.760- 12:49.780* :  It's very unclear why this should have happened.
*12:49.780- 12:51.580* :  Apparently, there were regular security checks.
*12:52.040- 12:54.760* :  So no bad weather, no foul play in yet.
*12:55.160- 12:58.500* :  Part of a historic building that's been fine since 1915
*12:58.500- 12:59.540* :  is suddenly in the road.
*12:59.820- 13:01.120* :  Yeah, it is odd.
*13:01.120- 13:04.420* :  It's been functioning, as you say, for a hundred and something years,
*13:04.420- 13:07.400* :  the only big event in the past was in 1915 when there was a fire.
*13:07.400- 13:10.140* :  And what we have there now is the rebuilt structure
*13:10.140- 13:12.940* :  and the actual blades of the windmill are quite new.
*13:12.940- 13:14.820* :  As well, they were replaced, I think, about 20 years ago
*13:14.820- 13:16.920* :  with a lighter aluminum structure.
*13:17.220- 13:19.200* :  All we know is that the management is
*13:19.280- 13:20.100* :  screwing out foul play.
*13:20.100- 13:20.980* :  They say, no, this was not.
*13:20.980- 13:21.560* :  There's no one there.
*13:21.560- 13:22.680* :  It's not Northern Bandalism.
*13:22.880- 13:23.900* :  It's a problem of maintenance.
*13:23.900- 13:26.780* :  But why, when they say themselves, they have regular checks,
*13:27.300- 13:27.960* :  it's just not clear.
*13:28.580- 13:31.360* :  He's scothil with a mystery of the Moulin Rouge in Paris.
*13:33.960- 13:35.060* :  Still to come on this podcast?
*13:35.380- 13:37.300* :  I'm by the Grand Canal, I'm seeing Gondoliers,
*13:37.300- 13:39.960* :  float past me, gorgeous bridges over the Grand Canal,
*13:39.960- 13:43.140* :  and the incredible buildings that line this wonderful unique city.
*13:43.300- 13:45.340* :  Venice is glorious, but it's also creaking
*13:45.340- 13:46.720* :  under the weight of masterism.
*13:46.880- 13:48.580* :  A new tourist tax in Venice.
*13:57.880- 13:59.120* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mid-Mobile.
*13:59.420- 14:00.860* :  With the price of just about everything
*14:00.860- 14:04.400* :  going up during inflation, we thought we'd bring our prices down.
*14:04.860- 14:07.420* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer,
*14:07.420- 14:08.660* :  which is apparently a thing.
*14:09.080- 14:10.960* :  Mid-Mobile, unlimited, premium wireless,
*14:10.960- 14:14.280* :  heavy to get $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $20, $20, $20, $20, $20,
*14:14.280- 14:17.060* :  $20, $20, $20, $15, $15, $15, $15, just $15 bucks a month.

*14:21.200- 14:23.020* :  $45 dollars left for three months plus taxes and fees

*14:24.520- 14:25.700* :  Unlimited more than 40 gigabytes per month.
*14:25.700- 14:27.200* :  So it's full turns at midmobile.com.
*14:28.020- 14:31.100* :  I knew right at that moment that my whole life was gone.
*14:31.460- 14:33.700* :  I'm going to jail for very, very long time.
*14:33.880- 14:35.200* :  There was no doubt about it.
*14:35.340- 14:39.540* :  Life's less ordinary is the podcast with astonishing personal stories
*14:39.860- 14:40.800* :  from across the globe.
*14:40.940- 14:43.240* :  And honestly, even at that point of reporting to a journalist,
*14:43.240- 14:47.140* :  I don't think I really knew that that was in itself an act of whistleblowing.
*14:47.380- 14:49.080* :  Expect the unexpected.
*14:49.080- 14:51.220* :  The only future is death here.
*14:51.460- 14:53.420* :  So if we live, we might have a chance.
*14:53.740- 14:56.100* :  We would die anyway, but we would die trying.
*14:56.360- 14:59.380* :  Life's less ordinary from the BBC World Service.
*14:59.860- 15:02.260* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*15:07.180- 15:10.760* :  More than a million displaced Palestinians have sought refuge in the city of Raffa
*15:10.760- 15:12.420* :  in the south of the Gaza Strip.
*15:12.840- 15:16.280* :  Israel says several battalions of Hamas fighters are there too.
*15:16.280- 15:20.680* :  And it's adamant it'll soon launch a major military operation to rig them out.
*15:21.200- 15:24.500* :  Israel's war cabinet has been meeting to talk about its next move.
*15:25.060- 15:25.680* :  Already got out.
*15:25.680- 15:29.000* :  It's head of medical activities in Gaza for Med Saint Saint Frontier.
*15:29.000- 15:32.840* :  She says the situation facing civilians in Raffa is dreadful.
*15:33.320- 15:36.400* :  The situation is very, I would say, on the brink.
*15:36.640- 15:37.440* :  It's tense.
*15:37.620- 15:39.460* :  Like people don't know what's going to happen.
*15:39.780- 15:40.200* :  No win.
*15:40.200- 15:47.820* :  Of course, they had started to kind of resettle in something that was very far away from being normal,
*15:47.820- 15:51.820* :  but they had some a bit more quietness or peace
*15:51.860- 15:54.280* :  about over the last few weeks.
*15:54.960- 15:59.020* :  And they're getting very, yeah, very tense, very anxious.
*15:59.820- 16:01.060* :  And they exhausted it.
*16:01.060- 16:06.540* :  So the the idea of the invasion, which is already terrifying for them,
*16:06.620- 16:11.640* :  is comes after almost seven months of very difficult life.
*16:11.640- 16:13.960* :  So it's they don't know where to go.
*16:13.960- 16:17.640* :  If they have to move from Raffa, living conditions are still disastrous.
*16:18.640- 16:22.820* :  Many unfortunately or fortunately for us, unfortunately for the country,
*16:23.620- 16:26.460* :  left as well for Egypt just to seek for safety.
*16:26.460- 16:33.560* :  The ones who can pay have seen an exodus of doctors, nurses, more and more over the last weeks.
*16:34.100- 16:35.440* :  But the answer is always the same.
*16:35.460- 16:36.280* :  There's nowhere safe.
*16:36.640- 16:39.320* :  I struggle for them to see the future.
*16:39.700- 16:41.720* :  They completely raise the country.
*16:41.720- 16:43.080* :  Everything is flattened.
*16:43.500- 16:45.660* :  There's no schools, no university.
*16:46.440- 16:48.360* :  It has all been destroyed, no hospitals.
*16:49.320- 16:51.480* :  I can't at all imagine what they're going through.
*16:51.480- 16:54.600* :  But if you're in a mother, you have small children.
*16:54.600- 16:55.440* :  There's no school.
*16:55.700- 16:56.680* :  You're a doctor, a nurse.
*16:56.680- 16:58.920* :  You can't do what you've been trained for.
*16:59.480- 17:00.240* :  And you're not safe.
*17:00.820- 17:02.760* :  And then I think it's as well.
*17:03.200- 17:05.860* :  Maybe part of the strategy to push them out of Gaza.
*17:06.480- 17:08.000* :  So there's actually no future.
*17:08.700- 17:12.980* :  So because they exhausted, they can't take it more.
*17:13.400- 17:14.580* :  They're used to war.
*17:14.580- 17:17.920* :  Unfortunately, they've been through all of them, even the youngest one.
*17:18.220- 17:20.220* :  And the new generation, they need a future.
*17:20.220- 17:21.600* :  They need a future in Gaza.
*17:22.160- 17:24.360* :  Orally Goddard from Mitzah, San Frontier.
*17:25.100- 17:27.120* :  In the former Soviet Republic of Georgia,
*17:27.120- 17:30.400* :  thousands of people have been protesting against a government plan
*17:30.400- 17:33.720* :  to reintroduce a controversial law on foreign funding,
*17:34.160- 17:36.180* :  which the critics have dubbed the Russian law.
*17:36.680- 17:39.520* :  This is the second attempt to bring the law onto the statute books
*17:39.520- 17:42.600* :  after it was abandoned last year in the face of mass protests.
*17:43.240- 17:44.840* :  This time the stakes are higher, though,
*17:44.840- 17:47.180* :  because for the Georgian youth leading these protests,
*17:47.180- 17:50.620* :  the proposed legislation seems to mean losing a chance
*17:50.620- 17:52.420* :  to join the European Union.
*17:53.000- 17:56.160* :  Rhaed Amitri sent this report from the Georgian capital to Bliisi.
*18:02.300- 18:04.240* :  Thousands of protesters, mainly students,
*18:04.240- 18:06.460* :  draped in the EU and Georgian flags,
*18:06.980- 18:09.500* :  marched down the capital to Bliisi's main avenue
*18:10.020- 18:14.080* :  to say no to the proposed bill on the transparency of foreign funding.
*18:14.520- 18:16.160* :  They call it the Russian law.
*18:23.400- 18:25.540* :  No to the Russian law, they chant.
*18:26.360- 18:29.560* :  In 2012, Russia adopted its version of the law
*18:29.900- 18:32.340* :  labeling government critics as foreign agents,
*18:32.340- 18:34.980* :  cutting off funding and imposing fines.
*18:35.580- 18:38.600* :  Over time, the expansion of the law has hollowed out
*18:38.600- 18:40.220* :  Russia's civil society.
*18:44.440- 18:46.260* :  Outside Georgian Parliament last week,
*18:46.260- 18:49.140* :  as MPs from the governing Georgian Dream Party
*18:49.140- 18:50.920* :  passed the first reading of the bill,
*18:51.360- 18:52.520* :  protesters chanted,
*18:57.600- 19:01.020* :  Russe Boer, Russians, and traitors.
*19:02.820- 19:06.220* :  The Georgian government rejects any similarity with the Russian law
*19:06.220- 19:09.960* :  and says the legislation is needed to ensure transparency.
*19:10.020- 19:13.980* :  Nikolos Samharadze is an MP from the Georgian Dream Party.
*19:14.360- 19:19.040* :  We have 25,000 active non-governmental organizations,
*19:19.740- 19:23.240* :  and 90% of those non-governmental organizations
*19:23.720- 19:26.860* :  get their funding from foreign sources.
*19:27.300- 19:28.680* :  And there is no accountability.
*19:29.320- 19:32.180* :  There is no transparency of where the funds come from
*19:32.180- 19:36.680* :  and for what purposes these funds are spent for.
*19:36.960- 19:42.800* :  For us, this is important to ensure the transparency of foreign funding.
*19:45.620- 19:47.600* :  But the protesters are not convinced.
*19:47.600- 19:52.820* :  They say almost all NGOs in Georgia are funded by the EU and the US
*19:53.240- 19:55.880* :  in programs aimed at strengthening democracy.
*19:56.580- 19:59.720* :  Information about donors is already openly available.
*20:00.360- 20:04.060* :  Tamaroniani is a representative of the Young Lawyers Association,
*20:04.520- 20:06.060* :  a leading government watchdog,
*20:06.460- 20:08.540* :  set to be targeted by the proposed bill.
*20:09.260- 20:12.480* :  And in this way, actually, it's not about transparency.
*20:12.580- 20:16.220* :  It's about suppressing civil society.
*20:16.640- 20:19.300* :  And we think that it's in the interest of Russia.
*20:20.000- 20:21.060* :  And that's why we are here.
*20:21.060- 20:24.240* :  Because it's not only the issue on the local level,
*20:24.840- 20:27.460* :  we think that it's issue of foreign policy for Georgia.
*20:27.460- 20:31.140* :  Because it shifts countries past from EU to Russia.
*20:37.160- 20:40.500* :  Georgia is currently a candidate country for EU membership.
*20:40.500- 20:44.280* :  It was granted the long-awaited status last December.
*20:44.900- 20:47.800* :  But with reintroduction of the foreign funding bill,
*20:48.140- 20:51.040* :  both Brussels and Washington openly stated
*20:51.460- 20:54.540* :  its adoption would derail Georgia from the European path.
*20:55.420- 20:57.160* :  To counter the growing discontent,
*20:57.160- 21:01.840* :  the governing dream party called on its supporters to gather on April 29,
*21:01.840- 21:03.540* :  as it said in a statement,
*21:03.540- 21:08.200* :  to say no to black money funding a revolution, political intervention,
*21:08.640- 21:11.900* :  attacks on the Orthodox Church and LGBT propaganda.
*21:15.220- 21:19.820* :  But against the backdrop of growing disinformation and confusion surrounding the bill,
*21:19.980- 21:23.160* :  the Georgian youth, the driving force behind the protests,
*21:23.160- 21:24.980* :  are clear about their goals,
*21:24.980- 21:29.120* :  to continue to fight for what they say is Georgia's future,
*21:29.540- 21:31.500* :  a part of Europe, not Russia.
*21:32.700- 21:34.560* :  Randomly true reporting from Tbilisi.
*21:35.300- 21:37.500* :  Late on Wednesday, shares in Meta,
*21:37.500- 21:39.860* :  the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp,
*21:39.860- 21:41.560* :  plunged on Wall Street,
*21:41.560- 21:45.160* :  despite the technology giant posting better than expected earnings.
*21:45.160- 21:48.920* :  Oliver Conway got the details from our business reporter Monica Miller.
*21:49.240- 21:54.000* :  Well, first quarter revenue rose 27% to more than 36 billion dollars.
*21:54.400- 21:57.660* :  I mean, 2023, according to Mark Zuckerberg,
*21:57.660- 22:01.920* :  was the year for efficiency, which made investors happy early on.
*22:02.060- 22:06.600* :  The stock soared up until now, up to about 40% for this year,
*22:06.600- 22:10.700* :  it made investors realize that they were kind of getting their fiscal house in order.
*22:11.120- 22:13.440* :  However, in the latest earnings call,
*22:13.680- 22:15.980* :  Meta announced that it's going to basically be switching gears,
*22:15.980- 22:19.760* :  moving forward, Meta said it expects in its April to June revenue.
*22:19.760- 22:23.140* :  It's going to be in the range of 36.5 billion to 39 billion,
*22:23.140- 22:25.440* :  which is less than what analysts had expected.
*22:25.980- 22:28.440* :  But what is really striking is during this call,
*22:28.440- 22:33.160* :  is when Mr. Zuckerberg starts to talk about his new investments in AI products,
*22:33.160- 22:35.680* :  you literally can see the stock on the chart.
*22:36.020- 22:37.200* :  It drops like a stone.
*22:37.200- 22:40.480* :  It lost roughly more than 15% of its shares,
*22:40.480- 22:43.000* :  because this makes investors incredibly nervous.
*22:43.300- 22:48.560* :  Now, I see that Meta no longer reports daily active users or monthly active users.
*22:48.920- 22:49.500* :  Why is that?
*22:49.500- 22:51.440* :  And has that had an impact on the value?
*22:51.660- 22:53.100* :  I think there are two reasons for that.
*22:53.140- 22:55.400* :  One, Facebook is now owned by Meta,
*22:55.400- 22:58.220* :  and there's multiple different apps that go along with this.
*22:58.220- 22:59.100* :  It's not just Facebook.
*22:59.100- 23:00.700* :  It's WhatsApp, it's Instagram.
*23:00.700- 23:04.120* :  So they pack in the family of apps when they look at these numbers.
*23:04.120- 23:08.920* :  And those numbers were up about $3.2 billion in March 2024,
*23:08.920- 23:10.380* :  a 7% increase.
*23:10.380- 23:13.520* :  But one of the other things that we've seen this with Netflix as well
*23:13.540- 23:16.680* :  is that subscribers have started to decline.
*23:16.680- 23:21.280* :  And for Meta, one of the big competitors is TikTok and some of the other things in this space.
*23:21.280- 23:25.220* :  So it's not always advantageous to be reporting these,
*23:25.220- 23:29.340* :  but when you have a whole family of different apps that people use for different reasons,
*23:29.500- 23:33.980* :  that might be in their case a more accurate description of what their products offer.
*23:34.840- 23:39.360* :  Now, today is St. Mark's Day, the feast day of the patron saint on Venice,
*23:39.920- 23:42.060* :  and traditionally one of the busiest days of the year
*23:42.400- 23:46.140* :  in a city that often feels swamped, not just by rising water levels,
*23:46.580- 23:49.780* :  but by tides of tourists crowning its canal sites.
*23:50.300- 23:53.220* :  It's also been chosen as the day to launch a world first,
*23:53.220- 23:57.380* :  a new initiative that'll see day trippers pay a five euro fee
*23:57.380- 24:00.080* :  for the privilege of going to Venice during peak periods.
*24:00.620- 24:03.160* :  And not everyone in this lagoon city seems convinced.
*24:03.280- 24:05.080* :  This is not fair.
*24:05.380- 24:08.140* :  I consider Venice to be the most beautiful city in the world,
*24:08.700- 24:13.180* :  so to deprive a person on a low budget of the opportunity to come here for an hour or two,
*24:13.520- 24:16.520* :  to enjoy this city is surely a shame for tourists.
*24:18.980- 24:20.940* :  This is not a natural park.
*24:21.340- 24:22.660* :  It is not a museum.
*24:22.660- 24:27.540* :  This is a city where we have to fight to have houses lived in by families,
*24:28.160- 24:30.100* :  and we have to reopen local shops.
*24:30.720- 24:33.340* :  This would also limit this wild tourism.
*24:34.720- 24:37.220* :  I've been talking to our correspondent Mark Loin, who's in Venice.
*24:37.800- 24:40.120* :  Venice is a fragile city.
*24:40.300- 24:43.200* :  It's threatened by climate change, rising sea waters,
*24:43.520- 24:44.960* :  but also by overtourism.
*24:45.200- 24:48.400* :  So the city has finally decided to try to tackle this
*24:48.560- 24:50.400* :  by a system that has started this morning,
*24:50.400- 24:52.140* :  and is in place around me right now actually,
*24:52.140- 24:55.200* :  because I'm talking to you from outside the city's main train station,
*24:55.200- 24:56.560* :  Santa Lucia train station,
*24:57.000- 25:01.520* :  where there are people in yellow and orange and white tibus jackets
*25:01.520- 25:05.380* :  that are checking people's phones to see if they have a QR code.
*25:05.740- 25:08.380* :  Now, if you are a day-tripper coming to Venice,
*25:08.380- 25:12.480* :  now around 30 days between now and July in this trial phase,
*25:13.020- 25:14.640* :  you will have to have paid five euros,
*25:14.640- 25:18.260* :  that's about $4.50 to enter the city.
*25:18.680- 25:21.480* :  Now, you pay on your phone and you get a QR code,
*25:21.600- 25:24.260* :  and then it is checked at random points around the city,
*25:24.260- 25:26.120* :  including here outside the train station.
*25:26.400- 25:28.480* :  There are exemptions for people who are young,
*25:28.560- 25:31.200* :  who are students, who are residents, who are staying overnight,
*25:31.200- 25:33.660* :  but you also have to have a QR code even if you are exempt.
*25:33.880- 25:36.160* :  And the city authorities say that this is a way
*25:36.160- 25:38.840* :  of trying to tackle mass tourism,
*25:38.900- 25:41.260* :  to stop people from just coming here for a few days,
*25:41.260- 25:43.340* :  or crowding into certain sites,
*25:43.340- 25:46.460* :  the Realtor Bridge and Marksware on certain days,
*25:47.000- 25:49.360* :  and to try to encourage people to space out their visits
*25:49.360- 25:50.180* :  at different times.
*25:50.280- 25:53.480* :  Needless to say, critics say that this doesn't address
*25:53.480- 25:54.860* :  the fundamental problems of Venice,
*25:54.860- 25:58.440* :  which include the fact that it is becoming a shell
*25:58.440- 25:59.700* :  for its local residents.
*25:59.840- 26:02.680* :  The local resident population is now fallen below 50,000
*26:02.680- 26:03.520* :  for the first time ever.
*26:03.520- 26:06.180* :  That's about a third of what it was in the 1950s,
*26:06.240- 26:09.580* :  because there's a very unusual tourist economy in Venice.
*26:09.580- 26:11.000* :  It's a real day trip venue.
*26:11.340- 26:12.980* :  Last time I was there, we actually stayed,
*26:12.980- 26:15.820* :  and it's mad busy through the mid-morning
*26:15.820- 26:17.520* :  and the afternoon period in the evening.
*26:17.580- 26:18.640* :  There's virtually nobody there.
*26:18.960- 26:21.220* :  Yeah, we find that every time we're here,
*26:21.220- 26:22.740* :  I mean, I was on some Marksware yesterday
*26:22.740- 26:25.140* :  and seeing the tour groups and people who were coming
*26:25.140- 26:26.060* :  just for a few hours,
*26:26.140- 26:27.680* :  but you do get people who are just saying,
*26:27.680- 26:28.580* :  I'm here for a few hours,
*26:28.580- 26:30.080* :  I'm going to go and see a few sites,
*26:30.560- 26:31.700* :  get my blighitry selfie,
*26:31.700- 26:34.080* :  buy a sort of kitchen souvenir and then leave.
*26:34.500- 26:36.640* :  And they don't really contribute to the overall economy,
*26:36.640- 26:39.040* :  and that's what Venetians aren't really quite frustrated about,
*26:39.040- 26:41.300* :  because they feel that that's not the way
*26:41.300- 26:43.780* :  to see a jewel of humanity, which is Venice.
*26:44.060- 26:45.580* :  I was going to say they probably have no idea
*26:45.580- 26:46.920* :  really what the balance will be.
*26:46.920- 26:49.480* :  Does it actually reduce the number of day trippers?
*26:49.480- 26:50.780* :  Does it make people stay longer?
*26:51.020- 26:53.700* :  Does it just raise a pile of cash to do something good with?
*26:53.860- 26:56.580* :  Yeah, I mean, when I spoke to the local tourism counsellor yesterday,
*26:56.580- 26:57.980* :  he said, I said, look,
*26:57.980- 27:00.420* :  five euros is less than a cost of a drink in a bar.
*27:00.420- 27:01.560* :  Is it really going to deter people?
*27:01.920- 27:03.240* :  And he said, look, for a family of four,
*27:03.600- 27:06.740* :  it could make them think again about coming on a specific day
*27:06.740- 27:08.000* :  and space out their visits.
*27:08.540- 27:09.600* :  And it is a trial.
*27:09.860- 27:11.740* :  And he said, you know, we could extend the number of days,
*27:11.740- 27:13.220* :  we could extend the price of it.
*27:13.480- 27:14.560* :  Let's see how this goes,
*27:14.920- 27:15.900* :  and we'll take it from there.
*27:16.120- 27:19.640* :  And just finally, Mark, it sounds very busy in Venice right now, around you.
*27:19.780- 27:22.200* :  It always is, you know, I'm by the Grand Canal,
*27:22.200- 27:24.160* :  I'm seeing the Gondoliers float past me,
*27:24.160- 27:26.680* :  I'm seeing the gorgeous bridges over the Grand Canal,
*27:26.680- 27:29.920* :  and the incredible buildings that line this wonderful unique city.
*27:30.080- 27:31.680* :  Venice is glorious, it is unique,
*27:31.680- 27:34.340* :  but it's also creaking under the weight of masterism.
*27:34.700- 27:35.800* :  Mark Lohan in Venice.
*27:36.300- 27:39.560* :  The mastermind behind some of the UK's biggest bank robberies,
*27:39.560- 27:42.060* :  Brian Reeder, has died at the age of 84.
*27:42.060- 27:44.420* :  He made millions from a string of heists,
*27:44.420- 27:47.380* :  and some of the stolen money in jewels have never been found.
*27:47.380- 27:48.840* :  Here's Wendy Erkett.
*27:50.560- 27:54.620* :  Hatton Gardens, Easter, no one at home.
*27:55.500- 27:57.440* :  We go down the shelf like Spider-Man,
*27:58.060- 28:00.840* :  into the wall, and the boat is ours.
*28:01.700- 28:05.620* :  The 2015 Hatton Garden Heist was the real-life bank raid
*28:05.620- 28:09.300* :  that was turned into an award-winning movie starring Michael Cain.
*28:09.300- 28:12.360* :  It was carried out by six career criminals.
*28:12.760- 28:16.400* :  The youngest was 49, the oldest 77.
*28:17.160- 28:19.700* :  John Collins, Daniel Jones, Terry Perkins,
*28:19.700- 28:22.240* :  Carl Wood, Hugh Doyle and William Lincoln
*28:22.620- 28:24.780* :  were handpicked by Brian Reeder.
*28:25.260- 28:27.340* :  He was the brains behind the operation,
*28:27.340- 28:32.180* :  and he travelled to the robbery on a bus using a pensioner's pass.
*28:32.580- 28:35.340* :  Brian Reeder spent three years planning the robbery
*28:35.740- 28:38.380* :  and the gang even carried out reconnaissance missions
*28:39.000- 28:40.400* :  before choosing the date.
*28:41.120- 28:44.280* :  Most businesses were shot for four days for Easter and Passover,
*28:44.920- 28:47.000* :  which provided the perfect cover.
*28:47.900- 28:50.600* :  Police have said this is the biggest robbery in UK history.
*28:50.600- 28:52.300* :  Everyone thinks you lost your nerve.
*28:52.760- 28:54.120* :  Well, I don't want to get caught again.
*28:54.460- 28:55.260* :  I am not stupid.
*28:56.040- 28:58.600* :  The crew entered the building by the lift shaft,
*28:59.000- 29:01.500* :  took apart the alarm, drilled through walls
*29:01.500- 29:03.420* :  that were 50 centimetres thick,
*29:03.820- 29:07.440* :  then climbed through a tiny 45 centimetre wide hole
*29:07.780- 29:08.780* :  to get to the loot.
*29:09.440- 29:12.480* :  They emptied more than 70 safety deposit boxes
*29:12.480- 29:18.060* :  and got away with a stash of more than $17 million in cash and jewelry.
*29:18.660- 29:21.320* :  After the event, police poured over CCTV
*29:21.620- 29:24.300* :  to try to find out who was involved.
*29:24.340- 29:27.400* :  What they discovered was that a white Mercedes
*29:27.400- 29:30.940* :  and another car were parked near the scene of the robbery.
*29:31.600- 29:34.260* :  They checked the number plates to find out who owned them,
*29:34.540- 29:35.840* :  then bugged the cars.
*29:36.300- 29:38.960* :  The gang were heard bragging about the heist
*29:39.220- 29:40.700* :  and incriminated themselves,
*29:40.700- 29:44.240* :  giving police enough information to raid their homes.
*29:44.800- 29:46.980* :  Four of the robbers were jailed for seven years,
*29:47.460- 29:48.780* :  two were given six years,
*29:49.120- 29:51.620* :  and Hugh Doyle received a suspended sentence.
*29:52.440- 29:55.620* :  Brian Reader was sentenced to six years and three months,
*29:55.620- 29:58.140* :  but he was released early on health grounds.
*29:58.700- 30:00.860* :  Police had a tip-off that some of the jewelry
*30:00.860- 30:04.240* :  had been buried under tombstones in a cemetery in London,
*30:04.780- 30:08.720* :  but they only managed to recover about a third of what was stolen.
*30:08.720- 30:12.980* :  And to this day, no one except the criminals involved
*30:13.520- 30:15.940* :  has any idea where the rest is.
*30:18.220- 30:20.400* :  Those dinbots, they've knocked this all up.
*30:22.740- 30:24.360* :  Yeah, like a pack of starving rice.
*30:24.520- 30:26.000* :  It's the blind lady in the dead.
*30:28.680- 30:30.080* :  And that report from Wendy Erkert.
*30:32.200- 30:33.220* :  And that's all from us for now.
*30:33.220- 30:35.740* :  There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
*30:36.140- 30:37.420* :  If you'd like to comment on this edition,

*30:48.540- 30:49.960* :  the producer was Rebecca Wood.
*30:50.140- 30:51.700* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*30:52.060- 30:53.380* :  I'm Andrew Peach, thanks for listening.
*30:53.380- 30:55.140* :  And until next time, goodbye.
*31:04.480- 31:07.600* :  I knew right at that moment that my whole life was gone.
*31:07.940- 31:10.180* :  I'm going to jail for very, very long time.
*31:10.180- 31:11.680* :  There was no doubt about it.
*31:11.840- 31:13.740* :  Live's less ordinary is the podcast
*31:13.740- 31:17.260* :  with astonishing personal stories from across the globe.
*31:17.440- 31:19.740* :  And honestly, even at that point of reporting to a journalist,
*31:19.900- 31:22.420* :  I don't think I really knew that that was in itself
*31:22.420- 31:23.640* :  an act of whistleblowing.
*31:23.880- 31:25.560* :  Expect the unexpected.
*31:25.560- 31:27.700* :  The only future is death here.
*31:27.960- 31:29.920* :  So if we live, we might have a chance.
*31:30.280- 31:32.580* :  We will die anyway, but we will die trying.
*31:32.880- 31:35.880* :  Live's less ordinary from the BBC World Service.
