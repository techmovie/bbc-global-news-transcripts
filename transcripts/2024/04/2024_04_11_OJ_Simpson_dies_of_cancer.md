*00:33.960- 00:37.140* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:39.840- 00:44.440* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Friday the 12th of April.
*00:44.800- 00:49.860* :  OJ Simpson, who is cleared in the trial of the century, has died at the age of 76.
*00:49.900- 00:55.860* :  It makes no sense. It doesn't fit. If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.
*00:56.380- 01:00.860* :  The former American football star had earlier tried to evade arrest in a televised
*01:00.860- 01:03.300* :  car chase after being accused of the double murder.
*01:11.900- 01:16.220* :  We hear from a journalist who covered the trial. In other news, Ukraine says the
*01:16.240- 01:20.140* :  biggest power plant in the Kiev region has been destroyed in a Russian attack.
*01:20.960- 01:24.940* :  An Instagram trials a new tool to combat so-called sex torsion.
*01:27.920- 01:34.180* :  Also in the podcast, thousands of Afghan children who fled to Iran are now being sent back home alone.
*01:34.720- 01:40.820* :  A lot of them haven't got refugee status or official documents, so many of them are arrested
*01:40.820- 01:47.280* :  and just directly taken to come and deported. And a big night for the global gaming industry.
*01:52.560- 01:57.140* :  Orenthal James Simpson, who was once the most famous murder suspect in the world,
*01:57.140- 02:03.500* :  has died at the age of 76. The former American footballer was already a huge celebrity when he was
*02:03.500- 02:09.040* :  thrust into the global limelight in the so-called trial of the century. He was accused of murdering
*02:09.040- 02:16.540* :  his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1994. He had already been watched by
*02:16.540- 02:23.540* :  millions on TV trying to evade police in a low-speed car chase. Thanks to his high-powered legal team,
*02:23.540- 02:29.440* :  he was acquitted, but later jailed for armed robbery and kidnapping. Ronald Goldman's father
*02:29.440- 02:36.060* :  has released a statement saying, OJ Simpson's death is no great loss. Our first report is from
*02:36.060- 02:42.700* :  Tom Bateman in Washington. OJ Simpson was an American icon for decades before his stardom became
*02:42.700- 02:48.640* :  infamy. OJ, or the juice, electrified sports fans in the late 1960s and 70s,
*02:49.020- 02:53.800* :  are running back at the University of Southern California, college football's top player.
*02:54.220- 03:00.060* :  He had a record-setting career in the NFL with the Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers.
*03:01.040- 03:04.840* :  Simpson turned his football fame into a career as a sports broadcaster,
*03:04.840- 03:11.000* :  advertising pitchman, and then Hollywood actor in films including The Naked Gun, Spoof Cop Series,
*03:11.420- 03:15.520* :  in which he played a witless police detective alongside the actor Leslie Nielsen.
*03:26.740- 03:32.640* :  All that changed in 1994 after his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman
*03:32.640- 03:38.720* :  were found stabbed to death outside her Los Angeles home. Simpson quickly emerged as a suspect.
*03:39.340- 03:43.720* :  He was ordered to surrender to police, but five days after the killings, he fled in his white
*03:43.720- 03:47.900* :  Ford Bronco with a former teammate carrying his passport and a disguise.
*03:54.740- 04:00.620* :  The chase was televised live from a news helicopter viewed by an estimated 95 million people,
*04:00.960- 04:05.000* :  ultimately culminating in Simpson's surrender to police and murder charges.
*04:05.420- 04:10.820* :  What ensued was one of the most notorious trials in 20th century America and the media circus.
*04:11.300- 04:16.500* :  A rich celebrity defendant, a black man accused of killing his white former wife out of jealousy,
*04:16.500- 04:22.920* :  a woman slain after divorcing a man who'd beaten her, and a dream team of pricey but charismatic
*04:22.920- 04:28.500* :  defense lawyers. The trial transfixed America and crystallized its racial divisions.
*04:29.200- 04:32.780* :  Prosecutors argued that Simpson killed Nicole in a jealous fury.
*04:32.780- 04:37.200* :  The defense countered that the defendant was framed by racist white police.
*04:37.760- 04:41.880* :  Prosecutors made Simpson try on a pair of bloodstain gloves found at the murder scene
*04:42.300- 04:45.480* :  in a highly theatrical demonstration he struggled to put them on.
*04:46.100- 04:51.220* :  And delivering the trials most famous words, defense lawyer Johnny Cochran made his closing arguments.
*04:51.220- 04:54.060* :  If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.
*04:54.320- 04:59.100* :  Simpson was found not guilty. He waved at the jurors and mowed the words, thank you,
*04:59.420- 05:03.140* :  after the predominantly black panel of 10 women and two men acquitted him.
*05:03.420- 05:08.320* :  The Goldman and Brown families later pursued a wrongful death lawsuit against Simpson in civil court,
*05:08.940- 05:14.020* :  and a predominantly white jury found him liable for the two deaths, ordering him to pay 35 million
*05:14.020- 05:19.840* :  dollars in damages. And in 2008, exactly 13 years after his acquittal in the murder trial,
*05:19.840- 05:25.200* :  Simpson was convicted by a Las Vegas jury on charges including kidnapping and armed robbery.
*05:25.200- 05:31.160* :  He was led away in a prison jumpsuit and leg shackles, and protested he didn't want to hurt anybody.
*05:31.840- 05:34.740* :  Simpson said, I didn't know I was doing anything wrong.
*05:35.480- 05:41.720* :  Tom Bateman reporting. For an assessment of OJ Simpson's life, I spoke to Tonyer Hart from Hollywood
*05:41.720- 05:48.120* :  Live. She says despite his success as an American footballer and actor, he'll be defined by the
*05:48.120- 05:53.340* :  double murder trial always in that such a shame and such a travesty. The whole thing,
*05:53.340- 05:57.640* :  there are no winners here. It was just one of those things that changed America,
*05:57.640- 06:02.660* :  but it did give us reality television for the better bad because that's how it started here.
*06:02.800- 06:10.000* :  The televised trial, it was huge and but also very divisive very much so a hundred million people
*06:10.000- 06:15.340* :  tuned into the verdict of that trial. It's just amazing. I mean, nothing like that has happened
*06:15.340- 06:21.660* :  since. It was divisive because Johnny Cochran was able, Johnny Cochran was my neighbor, by the way,
*06:22.220- 06:27.280* :  and knew him well. OJ, I had only met socially, you know, over the years and then after the trial,
*06:27.280- 06:32.300* :  I covered the trial for E and was in the courtroom that day. When they pulled that glove on, I got
*06:32.300- 06:37.200* :  to tell you, I'm looking at it and I'm like, that's not going to fit him. He's not going to be
*06:37.200- 06:41.420* :  able to get his hand in that because it is drunk. And of course, he couldn't and that's when Johnny
*06:41.420- 06:45.620* :  came out with that great line. If the glove does not fit, you must acquit and they did.
*06:46.380- 06:52.040* :  Johnny was able to move the trial from Santa Monica to Los Angeles downtown where he knew he would
*06:52.040- 06:58.180* :  have a black and brown jury pool. And he knew that because of the disparity here in America
*06:58.180- 07:02.460* :  between blacks and whites, that he would be able to get that jury on his side and he absolutely
*07:02.460- 07:08.660* :  did. And that was really what happened. Of course, the civil trial happened back in Santa Monica
*07:09.380- 07:15.360* :  and they did get that $33 million, I guess, judgment against him. However, none of that money
*07:15.360- 07:19.680* :  was ever paid to the Goldman's or the Browns. And so like I said, it's just a sad story.
*07:20.040- 07:25.320* :  You look at his children who apparently were by his side when he passed away, but their lives have
*07:25.320- 07:31.580* :  been just really torn apart. What do you say when your father has been accused of killing your mother?
*07:31.580- 07:36.920* :  How do you get over that? You don't. And eventually he did end up in jail in an unrelated
*07:36.920- 07:43.520* :  crime, an armed robbery in Las Vegas. Yes. I mean, anytime anybody gets away with a double murder,
*07:43.520- 07:49.000* :  he was acquitted. He was supposed to be going after the murderer and seeing if he could find out
*07:49.000- 07:54.140* :  who did it. No one's ever come to trial for that again. Think about that. You know, where is the
*07:54.140- 08:00.320* :  murderer? It wasn't OJ. I'm to say it like it is. And I think the only reason that he was charged
*08:00.320- 08:05.760* :  in Las Vegas, which was basically, you know, he would have had a slap on his hand. Had he not
*08:05.760- 08:11.780* :  been acquitted for this murder, to be honest. I think in his mind at that particular time,
*08:11.780- 08:17.440* :  he felt he was above the law. I mean, he just did. And that's what happened and said, no, he's
*08:17.440- 08:22.360* :  going to jail for something. And he did for nine years. What's been the reaction to his death where
*08:22.360- 08:27.340* :  you are in Los Angeles? Well, it's all over the news. You know, all of the news stations covered it.
*08:27.340- 08:32.660* :  It's been everywhere all morning. People are dissecting the trial, looking back at the video.
*08:32.660- 08:39.700* :  It's very interesting. OJ was such a charismatic person and such a great football player that he
*08:39.700- 08:45.940* :  crossed over. There were no boundaries for him. Tonya Hart from Hollywood live on OJ Simpson,
*08:45.940- 08:53.440* :  who's died at the age of 76. Other news now in Mexico has filed a lawsuit at the International Court
*08:53.440- 08:59.220* :  of Justice demanding Ecuador's expulsion from the United Nations over its raid on the Mexican
*08:59.220- 09:05.800* :  Embassy in Keto last Friday. Mexico accuses the Ecuadorian president Daniel Nabor of violating
*09:05.800- 09:12.580* :  diplomatic law. The incident drew condemnation across Latin America. Ecuadorian authorities say
*09:12.580- 09:17.400* :  they were trying to prevent the escape of Jorge Glass, a former vice president who was seeking
*09:17.400- 09:22.680* :  asylum in the Mexican Embassy, but who was wanted for alleged corruption. Our Mexico correspondent
*09:22.680- 09:28.140* :  Will Grant has the details. The ill feeling between Mexico and Ecuador continues to grow.
*09:28.740- 09:33.000* :  In the latest development, Mexico has called on the United Nations to suspend Ecuador,
*09:33.000- 09:38.660* :  following the police raid on the Mexican Embassy in Keto. A Mexican delegation filed its complaint
*09:38.660- 09:43.220* :  at the International Court of Justice in the Hague, a move which was applauded by the Mexican
*09:43.220- 09:47.640* :  president and that his man will lop his over to the order to his daily news conference in Mexico City.
*09:48.440- 09:53.660* :  In accordance with the United Nations charter, he said the UN should approve the expulsion,
*09:54.240- 09:57.240* :  and there should be no veto from the Security Council he added.
*09:58.200- 10:03.220* :  Last week, Ecuadorian police entered Mexico's diplomatic mission in Keto to arrest Ecuador's
*10:03.220- 10:09.020* :  former vice president, Jorge Glass, who had been granted political asylum by Mexico and was inside
*10:09.020- 10:14.400* :  its embassy. In scenes which have prompted widespread condemnation around the world and across
*10:14.400- 10:19.740* :  the political spectrum in Mexico, the Mexican charge either fares was thrown to the ground by officers
*10:19.740- 10:25.460* :  and Mr. Glass was dragged out of the building. The Ecuadorian president Daniel Noboa has refused
*10:25.460- 10:30.880* :  to apologize for the incident, saying Ecuador's people reject any kind of impunity for criminals,
*10:30.880- 10:36.640* :  corruption, or narco terrorists. Former vice president Glass was facing embezzlement charges
*10:36.640- 10:41.620* :  and had been living inside Mexico's embassy since December. Will Grant in Mexico?
*10:42.480- 10:47.900* :  The Tropical Square power plant in central Ukraine provides electricity for three regions around
*10:47.900- 10:53.860* :  the capital Kiev, or at least it did. It was destroyed in Russia's latest attack on Ukraine's
*10:53.860- 10:59.260* :  energy facilities overnight Wednesday into Thursday. The Ukrainians managed to shoot down more than
*10:59.260- 11:05.140* :  two-thirds of the missiles and drones used in the assaults, but 20 got through. Ukraine's president,
*11:05.140- 11:10.860* :  Vladimir Zelensky, has appealed to Western allies for more air defenses. Yuri Sak is an advisor
*11:10.860- 11:17.160* :  to Ukraine's Minister of Strategic Industries. That power plant, which was the major source of power
*11:17.160- 11:23.120* :  generation for Kiev region, Cherkassia region, and Jotomia region, the total number of people
*11:23.120- 11:29.840* :  who live there is about seven million. It was attacked by 20 cruise missiles, takes hypersonic
*11:29.840- 11:34.720* :  missiles, and it was attacked by four ballistic missiles. There were also launches of
*11:34.720- 11:41.140* :  ahead drones. What we are facing right now is a severe energy crisis in central Ukraine,
*11:41.140- 11:46.340* :  and of course other parts of Ukraine have also been targeted at this another terrorist missile attack.
*11:46.340- 11:47.980* :  So the situation is pretty serious.
*11:48.600- 11:53.100* :  Well, Miroslav Yencha is the UN Assistant Secretary General for Europe, Central Asia,
*11:53.100- 11:58.120* :  and the Americas. Speaking in New York, he gave more details about the Russian attacks.
*11:58.700- 12:07.160* :  Since March, the large-scale coordinated attacks on critical infrastructure destroyed or damaged
*12:07.160- 12:15.780* :  more than 2,000 energy facilities throughout the country, including the Nipro hydroelectric power plant.
*12:16.260- 12:22.540* :  These attacks have disrupted access to electricity for millions of Ukrainians in large cities
*12:22.540- 12:31.120* :  and in rural areas. Water supply was also disrupted in some locations. The disruptions may last
*12:31.180- 12:35.580* :  for many months due to the extent of the widespread damage.
*12:36.120- 12:42.360* :  Among the cities affected in this latest attack was the second largest Hakhiv, where 200,000
*12:42.360- 12:48.100* :  people were left without power. The BBC's Eastern Europe Correspondent Sarah Reinsford has this
*12:48.100- 12:53.600* :  update from the city. It's dark, but perhaps not as dark as you might think. I mean, this is an
*12:53.600- 12:57.980* :  extraordinary city. It always has been Hakhiv. It has a reputation for being unbreakable and
*12:57.980- 13:04.180* :  indomitable, and so I'm standing now on probably the main square, I guess, right by the city
*13:04.180- 13:08.860* :  administration. There's a hotel behind me with a massive hole in the side of it. That's a hotel
*13:08.860- 13:13.280* :  we always used to use, but it's had a missile through the side of it in recent months.
*13:13.780- 13:17.800* :  But just alongside, there's a restaurant where the lights are on. They work on generators when
*13:17.800- 13:23.060* :  they don't get mains power. There are people sitting out on the terrace, eating their dinner,
*13:23.060- 13:28.700* :  having a drink. There are kids around and about on scooters, and yet there are constant air rays,
*13:28.940- 13:33.160* :  and there are missile strikes. And at the moment, in Hakhiv, like right across Ukraine,
*13:33.160- 13:38.600* :  they're targeting the power supply. And it is having a massive effect, not just on the fact that,
*13:38.600- 13:42.200* :  you know, houses are having rolling blackouts, so you can come home and have no power for
*13:42.200- 13:47.320* :  six hours a day. But it's also obviously affecting industrial production. It's affecting every
*13:47.320- 13:54.020* :  single business that works here. And Hakhiv has basically had all of it power supply. So all the
*13:54.020- 14:00.280* :  power plants that supplied the city have been totally destroyed. So they are now relying on power,
*14:00.280- 14:06.120* :  coming from outside of Hakhiv, and Russia is going after that too. So it's worrying, I think,
*14:06.120- 14:12.500* :  I would say. Sarah Rainsford in Ukraine's second city. The humanitarian organization doctors
*14:12.500- 14:18.200* :  without borders is warning that a catastrophic hunger crisis in Sudan is worse than feared.
*14:18.220- 14:23.120* :  It assessed the health of tens of thousands of children and women in a displaced people's
*14:23.120- 14:29.960* :  camp in North Darfur state, and found one in three was malnourished. A year of war between the army
*14:29.960- 14:35.460* :  and a rival paramilitary group has had a devastating humanitarian impact across Sudan,
*14:35.460- 14:40.200* :  especially in Darfur. Our Africa correspondent Barbara Platasha reports.
*14:40.960- 14:45.560* :  At least one child dies every two hours in the Zamzam camp for displaced people,
*14:45.580- 14:50.820* :  according to doctors without borders. It has just completed a mass screening of mothers and
*14:50.820- 14:56.320* :  children under five and found one-third of them to be acutely malnourished. That's double the
*14:56.320- 15:02.740* :  threshold for a nutrition emergency. And this is only one camp in one small part of Darfur. A
*15:02.740- 15:07.440* :  regional emergency worker sent the BBC photos of emaciated children from other areas of the
*15:07.440- 15:12.440* :  region that are even more cut off. Sudan's conflict has displaced millions of people,
*15:12.440- 15:18.220* :  ruined the economy, and blocked aid to vulnerable populations. humanitarian workers say it will
*15:18.220- 15:23.100* :  not be possible to turn the tide on this catastrophe, unless there is a surge of food supplies,
*15:23.560- 15:27.980* :  and much greater access to deliver it. Barbara Platasha in Nairobi.
*15:29.040- 15:33.480* :  Governments around the world have warned of the increasing threat to young people from
*15:33.480- 15:38.760* :  sex torsion, the form of blackmail involving the exploitation of intimate online pictures.
*15:39.360- 15:43.760* :  Now, Instagram has announced the trial of a new tool to try to protect users.
*15:44.340- 15:49.500* :  It works by blurring naked images sent in direct messages. This nudity protection
*15:49.500- 15:54.400* :  will be turned on by default for under 18s. Our technology reporter, Chris Valens,
*15:54.400- 16:00.160* :  told me about the scale of the problem. Well, I mean, Instagram calls sex torsion a horrific
*16:00.160- 16:03.620* :  crime. It's really, you know, it's quite hard to disagree with that assessment. Essentially,
*16:03.620- 16:08.500* :  you've got criminals who will pretend to be, let's say, an attractive young woman. They'll
*16:08.500- 16:15.560* :  encourage, perhaps by sending a naked picture to the victim, usually a man or a teenage boy,
*16:15.560- 16:22.680* :  to exchange naked images of themselves, and then blackmail them with the aim of extorting money.
*16:23.420- 16:29.180* :  It's a terrible crime, and it's an international crime. We recently had two Nigerian men,
*16:29.180- 16:34.500* :  three guilty to sexually extorting teenage boys and young men in the US, including one who took
*16:34.500- 16:42.540* :  his own life. The FBI says, between 2021 and March 2023, there were 13,000 reports of online
*16:42.540- 16:49.820* :  financial sex torsion of minors, primarily boys, and that led to at least 20 suicides. You can
*16:49.820- 16:56.660* :  see why governments are concerned. Yeah, obviously has a dreadful impact. Tell us how this tool
*16:57.500- 17:02.920* :  will combat the problem and whether it'll work. Well, essentially, the tool is an AI-powered
*17:02.920- 17:09.520* :  nudity detector, if you like, that runs entirely on the device. And what it does is it blurs naked
*17:09.520- 17:15.040* :  images in direct messages when it spots them, but it does more than that. So when somebody tries to
*17:15.160- 17:21.420* :  send a naked picture that the AI has spotted, essentially what it will do is it will sort of warn
*17:21.440- 17:25.840* :  them that the image could be screenshot, that it might be shared, that it might be seen by families,
*17:26.440- 17:31.620* :  so that it's hoped would sense it stopped someone sending a naked image to a criminal.
*17:31.620- 17:37.080* :  And then on the other side, when you receive it, it also blurs the image. You've got the option
*17:37.440- 17:41.220* :  whether or not to look at the image, but it also says, look, you don't need to feel pressured
*17:41.620- 17:48.880* :  to respond to an image. Again, sort of if you like a nudge, not to necessarily engage with someone
*17:48.880- 17:53.120* :  who is a criminal. Our technology reporter, Chris Vance.
*17:56.060- 18:01.540* :  Still to come on the Global News podcast. We are very proud of being a part of such an
*18:01.580- 18:08.680* :  international program. Why a Japanese astronaut is set to become the first non-American to set foot
*18:16.880- 18:21.320* :  on the moon. The scale of sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic church around the world has taken
*18:21.320- 18:27.120* :  decades to emerge. Last summer on a visit to Portugal, Pope Francis acknowledged the pain
*18:27.120- 18:34.520* :  caused by the failure to tackle the crisis. It is often accentuated by the disappointment and
*18:34.520- 18:40.240* :  the anger with which some people view the church due to our poor witness and the scandals that have
*18:40.240- 18:46.460* :  marred her face and called us to a humble and ongoing purification, starting with the anguished
*18:46.460- 18:55.020* :  cry of the victims who must always be accepted and listened to. Well now the church in Portugal has
*18:55.020- 19:00.140* :  become the latest to try to make amends with the creation of a fund to pay reparations to victims
*19:00.140- 19:05.800* :  of clerical sexual abuse. It follows an explosive report last year, which revealed the systematic
*19:05.800- 19:11.220* :  cover-up of the abuse of almost 5,000 children. I heard more details from our correspondent
*19:11.220- 19:17.020* :  in Portugal, Alison Roberts. The church in the wake of that really devastating report, which
*19:17.020- 19:24.260* :  included some quite graphic details from individual cases, set up another expert group to receive
*19:24.260- 19:30.800* :  complaints from any victims that hadn't come forward already and also began to look at this question
*19:30.800- 19:36.180* :  of possible reparations, which is the word that they use rather compensation for any victims
*19:36.180- 19:40.800* :  that might want it. We haven't been given a lot of detail. It does seem that the expert group
*19:40.800- 19:46.600* :  that they set up had put forward some suggestions for criteria on which amounts could be decided.
*19:46.600- 19:50.740* :  The bishops then sent that back to the group with some suggested changes, the group then
*19:51.060- 19:56.180* :  sent it back and none of this has come out into the public forums. So the group itself has been
*19:56.220- 20:01.340* :  making some announcements, for example, of the fact that 20 victims have expressed the
*20:01.340- 20:06.580* :  desire for compensation, but we don't know the details of, as I say, of these criteria. So what
*20:06.580- 20:11.800* :  the bishops say is that between June and December of this year, they will be accepting requests,
*20:12.420- 20:18.120* :  but that a commission in order to decide any amount has yet to be set up and they will be
*20:18.420- 20:22.920* :  calling on that group of experts and other experts outside of the church to decide who should
*20:22.920- 20:27.220* :  be on that commission and on what basis they should be making those decisions. Alison Roberts in
*20:27.220- 20:32.440* :  Lisbon. Antonio Grosso is the co-founder of a lobby group for abuse survivors called the
*20:32.440- 20:36.640* :  Silence Heart Association. He says this latest announcement is disappointing.
*20:39.460- 20:45.700* :  The criteria have not yet been defined. The amounts of compensation have not yet been defined.
*20:46.760- 20:52.040* :  And it says that they will create a fund, but it doesn't say how much will be in this fund
*20:52.040- 20:59.340* :  to distribute to survivors. And it says they'll passively await requests for compensation.
*21:00.560- 21:06.600* :  We are not beggars. Antonio Grosso of the Silence Heart Association.
*21:07.760- 21:13.500* :  The capital of Colombia and the surrounding region around Bogota have started rationing water
*21:14.040- 21:19.540* :  after a drought made worse by the El Niño weather phenomenon. Reservoirs are critically low
*21:19.540- 21:25.880* :  with one that helps provide the capital's water at less than 17% capacity. It is Mimi Swaby.
*21:26.520- 21:31.280* :  Bogota and 11 municipalities surrounding it are suffering their most severe water scarcity
*21:31.280- 21:36.520* :  in 40 years. At least 9 million people will be impacted by the drastic rationing measures
*21:37.040- 21:41.520* :  introduced today. It's hoped household consumption of water will drop by around 11%.
*21:42.260- 21:46.400* :  The region has been split into 9 different zones and each one will take turns switching off
*21:46.400- 21:52.080* :  its water services. The restrictions began at 8am local time and will last 24 hours before
*21:52.080- 21:56.780* :  shifting to the next zone in line. Hospitals and schools are not included. They have separate
*21:56.780- 22:01.680* :  contingency plans. Bogota's mayor said the measures will be in place until water levels improve,
*22:01.680- 22:05.460* :  but restrictions will be reviewed in a fortnight. Mimi Swaby.
*22:06.220- 22:11.980* :  Afghanistan says Iran has deported 20,000 Afghan children who'd entered the country
*22:11.980- 22:17.740* :  illegally during the last year. The children say many of their families are still in Iran and
*22:17.740- 22:23.220* :  they are now all alone in Afghanistan. So yeah, Sharia from the BBC Persian service told me more.
*22:23.680- 22:29.060* :  The Taliban border officials in the Nimrod province in Western Afghanistan have local media in
*22:29.060- 22:35.300* :  Afghanistan saying that they have registered 20,000 unaccompanied children, mostly under 15 years
*22:35.320- 22:41.440* :  old. In the last year who have been deported from Iran and these children are in a very difficult
*22:41.440- 22:48.500* :  situation. One of the officials has said that they have been able to manage finding the parents or
*22:48.500- 22:53.840* :  the family members of 3,000 of these kids, but the risks of them are still in an onset in
*22:53.840- 22:59.280* :  situation. A lot of them have their families back in Iran because they've been, according to reports,
*22:59.280- 23:04.120* :  deported when they were working on the street or when they were away from their parents.
*23:04.660- 23:09.360* :  Many of them are children and their parents who have not got documents in Iran.
*23:09.360- 23:15.300* :  Millions of Afghans live in Iran and a lot of them haven't got refugee status or official
*23:15.300- 23:20.780* :  documents. So many of them are arrested and just directly taken to camps and then deported.
*23:21.120- 23:25.540* :  Obviously, their families are looking for them, but also the other problem is that probably many
*23:25.540- 23:29.940* :  of these families were living in Iran. They're living in hiding, working in hiding. They don't have
*23:29.940- 23:35.040* :  movement, capacity easily and they could be arrested any time and just deported back. So we're
*23:35.040- 23:39.860* :  talking about something like 17,000 of the children who have no contact with their parents.
*23:39.880- 23:44.400* :  Who's looking after them in Afghanistan? The Taliban have said that's them who are looking after
*23:44.400- 23:50.080* :  them, but also some NGOs and UN agencies who are helping with them. We do know a lot about
*23:50.200- 23:55.280* :  deportations of the adults from Iran. Hundreds of thousands have been deported in the last few
*23:55.280- 23:59.520* :  months, but with regards to these children, we're looking for more details, obviously.
*23:59.760- 24:04.620* :  And is this something that's got a lot worse since the Taliban came back into power in Afghanistan?
*24:04.620- 24:08.300* :  Because we're also seeing Afghans being deported from Pakistan.
*24:09.300- 24:15.720* :  That's right. Since the Taliban took over in August 2021, millions have fled the country,
*24:16.180- 24:21.240* :  majority of them to neighboring countries, Pakistan and Iran. The Iranian officials have announced
*24:21.240- 24:27.320* :  there are five million Afghans in Iran. At least one to two million have fled in the last two,
*24:27.320- 24:30.900* :  three years and be at the same problem in Pakistan.
*24:31.480- 24:37.260* :  Dear Sharia of the BBC Persian Service. Now, it may not be as celebrated as music and film,
*24:37.260- 24:44.600* :  but the gaming industry is huge. It was thought to be worth more than $200 billion globally in 2023.
*24:45.300- 24:49.700* :  On Thursday night here in London, it was celebrated in the BAFTA Games Awards,
*24:49.700- 24:51.740* :  our reporter, Guy Lambert, was there.
*24:58.020- 25:01.640* :  With tend nominations, all eyes were on the team behind Baldur's Gate 3.
*25:01.640- 25:06.780* :  The third installment in a series based on the popular fancy role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons.
*25:07.300- 25:11.560* :  And they weren't disappointed, picking up five awards, including Best Narrative,
*25:11.560- 25:16.800* :  the Players Choice Award, which was decided by a public vote, and the top prize of Best Game.
*25:17.360- 25:22.000* :  Best British game went to viewfinder, where players have to use Polaroid photographs to solve
*25:22.000- 25:27.200* :  puzzles and advance through different levels. The gaming industry was worth nearly $6 billion
*25:27.200- 25:33.800* :  to the UK economy in 2023, and the ceremony showed just how valuable and diverse the games on
*25:33.800- 25:42.220* :  offer are right now. Guy Lambert. To mark the state visit to the US by the Japanese Prime Minister
*25:42.220- 25:47.580* :  Fumio Kishida. President Biden has announced that a Japanese astronaut will become the first
*25:47.580- 25:52.520* :  non-American to set foot on the moon during one of NASA's upcoming Artemis missions.
*25:52.520- 25:57.700* :  The program aims to put people back on the lunar surface for the first time in more than 50 years
*25:57.700- 26:03.420* :  ahead of potential missions to Mars. Naoko Yamazaki is one of only two
*26:03.420- 26:07.940* :  Japanese women to ever go into space. She's been talking to James Menendez.
*26:08.480- 26:15.040* :  I was so excited about the agreement, because you noticed sending a Japanese astronaut to the moon
*26:15.040- 26:20.520* :  is such a huge goal. What does it mean for Japan and particularly for its space program?
*26:20.840- 26:26.460* :  Japan has been participating in the International Space Station program since mid-80s.
*26:26.520- 26:31.420* :  We are very proud of being a part of such an Artemis International program.
*26:31.700- 26:36.920* :  Human presence on the moon means a lot, because there are so many problems on the ground,
*26:36.920- 26:43.500* :  but if we can expand our frontier, we can expand our possibilities to solve the problems from space.
*26:43.820- 26:47.740* :  Do you think that's true? I mean, you went up to the International Space Station.
*26:47.740- 26:52.760* :  Do you think international collaboration in space is good for diplomacy?
*26:52.760- 26:58.060* :  Yes, I think so. Fifteen nations are involved in the International Space Station.
*26:58.600- 27:04.480* :  It now, 36 nations have signed the agreement of the Artemis program.
*27:05.200- 27:09.120* :  I think it is a good thing to expand our collaboration in space,
*27:09.640- 27:13.660* :  because it is important to utilize space in an ordered way.
*27:13.920- 27:18.860* :  And why do we need to go back to the moon? Because, of course, we have been there before.
*27:19.580- 27:25.860* :  In the past years, we found water on the moon, which is in an ice shape or within a rock.
*27:26.820- 27:34.000* :  So if we can utilize the water on the moon, then it makes us easier to fly to Mars.
*27:34.340- 27:38.120* :  I mean, it was dangerous back in the 1960s. Is it still dangerous?
*27:38.120- 27:42.680* :  Will it be dangerous now to undertake that mission to the moon?
*27:43.140- 27:48.860* :  I think so. Human space program, of course, involves risks in it.
*27:49.260- 27:55.800* :  And there is no mission with zero risks, but we should pay the risks to expand our frontier.
*27:56.240- 28:00.440* :  And the Japanese astronaut who will walk on the moon one day.
*28:00.980- 28:05.720* :  I mean, would you like that to be a woman? Are there women astronauts coming through now
*28:05.720- 28:12.400* :  who would be eligible? Of course. And last year, Japanese aerospace exploration agency
*28:12.400- 28:16.440* :  selected two new astronaut candidates, one man and one woman.
*28:16.820- 28:19.820* :  So I'm looking forward to seeing both on the moon.
*28:20.180- 28:22.300* :  Will you be feeling a bit jealous when it happens?
*28:24.000- 28:27.380* :  To tell you the truth, yes, I wish I could be there, of course.
*28:27.700- 28:31.020* :  Is it amazing going into space? Do you miss those days?
*28:31.480- 28:36.320* :  Yes, I miss the feeling of microgravity and I miss the international collaboration in space.
*28:37.000- 28:41.220* :  Retire Japanese astronaut Naoko Yamazaki talking to James Menendez.
*28:42.080- 28:47.660* :  Finally, three men stranded on an uninhabited desert island have been rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.
*28:48.360- 28:50.140* :  Stephanie Zacherson takes up the story.
*28:50.700- 28:56.180* :  It was a journey that started on a seven meter open skiff when the sailors all in their forties
*28:56.600- 28:58.880* :  set off on their adventure in the pacific ocean.
*28:59.520- 29:03.840* :  They'd left the coral atled polo at in Micronesia on the last day of March.
*29:04.400- 29:08.280* :  But six days later, the emergency services received a distress call.
*29:08.760- 29:13.520* :  It was from a woman reporting that her three young girls hadn't returned home as expected.
*29:14.220- 29:19.300* :  A rescue operation was organised, but the mission seemed as challenging as finding a needle
*29:19.300- 29:25.260* :  in a haystack. The federated states of Micronesia, south of Guam and North of Papua New Guinea,
*29:25.700- 29:29.120* :  consists of no less than 607 islands.
*29:29.860- 29:37.060* :  The initial search area was nearly 270,000 square kilometres, and the weather conditions were poor.
*29:37.660- 29:41.580* :  But the crew of a reconnaissance aircraft spotted a makeshift sign.
*29:42.220- 29:48.040* :  On the beach of a tiny island, they could read the word help, spelled out with large leaves from
*29:48.040- 29:53.980* :  palm trees covering the white sand. It was a crucial factor in the discovery of the men,
*29:54.400- 29:58.780* :  allowing the plain to air drop survival packages and a radio to the stranded trio.
*29:59.440- 30:05.000* :  They radioed back, seeing they were in good health, but needed some help getting back a hoe.
*30:07.740- 30:10.780* :  The next day, the castaways were picked up by the Coast Guard.
*30:11.380- 30:15.900* :  The men had survived on coconut meat and water from a small well on the island.
*30:16.720- 30:21.040* :  It is the second time in four years that people have been rescued from pickle at all.
*30:21.660- 30:25.940* :  After the rescue, the Coast Guard gave a word of advice to anyone setting sail,
*30:26.420- 30:30.780* :  saying that they should always take an emergency locator beacon with them.
*30:35.320- 30:39.140* :  That's all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*30:39.140- 30:42.900* :  This edition was mixed by Chesney Forks Porter and produced by Emma Joseph,
