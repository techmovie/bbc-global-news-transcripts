*00:50.660- 00:52.880* :  we thought we'd bring our prices down.

*01:24.660- 01:25.880* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:25.880- 01:29.440* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Saturday, the 13th of April.
*01:30.080- 01:33.820* :  A new governing council is announced in Haiti after a wave of violence
*01:33.820- 01:37.200* :  forced the Prime Minister from office, but can it restore order?
*01:37.840- 01:42.060* :  The US says Iran could attack Israel with drones and missiles within hours.
*01:42.880- 01:45.940* :  And what a protestors are going on hunger strike in the Canary Islands.
*01:48.580- 01:54.040* :  Also, in this podcast, could 2024 be the year Ukraine loses its war against Russia?
*01:54.680- 01:55.220* :  And...
*01:55.400- 01:58.000* :  Not to the woman if she's going to be a pervert.
*01:58.300- 02:03.220* :  But a man does not become a woman when he puts on a wig and a clich√© low-cut dress.
*02:03.780- 02:08.980* :  Despite the anger of some in Parliament, Germany makes it easier to legally change China.
*02:12.180- 02:16.960* :  For years, Haiti has been robbed by political instability, made worse by the assassination of
*02:16.960- 02:23.100* :  President Jovenile Moise in 2021. In recent months, criminal gangs have seized control of much
*02:23.100- 02:28.340* :  of the capital, Porto Prince, forcing the unelected Prime Minister, Ariel Henri, to step down.
*02:29.100- 02:34.320* :  A leadership council has now been announced to replace him, though the details are still somewhat
*02:34.320- 02:40.540* :  uncertain. It's hoped it could pave the way for elections in 2026, which would be the first
*02:40.540- 02:45.920* :  for ten years. But given that the gang leaders are not involved, can it work?
*02:45.920- 02:51.280* :  I heard more about the formation of the new council from journalist Harold Isaac in Porto Prince.
*02:52.120- 02:58.200* :  Well, we're not quite there yet, precisely because the decree published by the government
*02:58.760- 03:05.940* :  is incomplete, because what it did is name the sectors that had representative to be part of
*03:05.940- 03:10.780* :  that council, but not the names themselves. So we don't know who will be on this council?
*03:11.240- 03:17.580* :  For the moment, no, and it's still a part of intense negotiations and debates in the background.
*03:17.580- 03:23.620* :  So they might be negotiating as we speak? Very likely, because as it stands right now,
*03:23.820- 03:28.900* :  Prime Minister had pledged to step down a month ago once the council would be up and running,
*03:28.900- 03:34.940* :  and the complication right now is that the outgoing cabinet wants certain conditions in order
*03:34.940- 03:41.020* :  to relinquish power. Now, we don't know who is on the council, but we know some of the people who
*03:41.020- 03:48.260* :  will not be on it. And one of those names is Jimmy Barbeque-Therisia, one of the powerful gang leaders,
*03:48.260- 03:55.720* :  how big an absence will he be not being there? No clear reactions from him to this news,
*03:55.720- 04:02.320* :  as of now, but he did this week issued a video where he warned that he was not approving of the
*04:02.320- 04:08.160* :  council itself. And at the time of our talk right now, there was shooting being reported downtown,
*04:08.160- 04:13.800* :  which is likely coming from gangs or unhappy with that breakthrough. Now, in ordinary times,
*04:13.800- 04:22.860* :  you wouldn't want any gang leaders in power, but without them, is it possible for this interim
*04:22.860- 04:29.160* :  council to survive? Well, the gang themselves have been facing their own crisis of legitimacy,
*04:29.260- 04:36.360* :  all they've been essentially doing in the past month is wage terror and destruction and violence.
*04:36.920- 04:41.940* :  And as such, you're not necessarily in a situation that'd be comparable to, you know, Afghanistan
*04:41.940- 04:47.460* :  with Taliban, which some people have compared it to. And therefore, they cannot necessarily be
*04:47.460- 04:53.520* :  looking at claiming power itself, which leaves the Haitian society and the Haitian civil society
*04:54.000- 04:58.880* :  and political parties are the responsibility of moving the country forward, but yet they cannot
*04:58.880- 05:05.960* :  agree on how they will do so. But if the transition council is able to be set up, can it rest control
*05:05.960- 05:12.520* :  from the gangs? That's everybody's question right now. The thing is, the international community
*05:12.520- 05:21.020* :  has pledged to support Haiti's duly constitutional authorities, even if transitional, to lead to
*05:21.020- 05:27.880* :  security and elections within the next couple of years, which is very ambitious, but seems to be
*05:28.280- 05:33.720* :  an inevitable path to restore some semblance of a state in the country.
*05:34.440- 05:37.680* :  Journalist Harold Isaac in the Haitian capital, Porto Prince.
*05:38.700- 05:44.380* :  Over the past few days, the US has issued numerous warnings about a possible attack on Israel by Iran.
*05:44.540- 05:49.740* :  A few hours ago, President Biden said he expected it to come sooner, rather than later,
*05:50.280- 05:56.100* :  but said his message to Iran was simply, don't. The Iranians, though, have insisted that they will
*05:56.100- 06:00.760* :  quote, punish Israel for the recent drone strike on the Iranian Consulate in Syria,
*06:01.220- 06:04.740* :  which killed seven members of the Revolutionary Guard, including a top commander.
*06:05.580- 06:10.000* :  US official said on Friday they thought Iran may launch more than 100 drones,
*06:10.000- 06:15.540* :  cruise missiles, and even ballistic missiles at Israel. The US National Security Council
*06:15.540- 06:21.940* :  spokesman is John Kirby. We still deem the potential threat by Iran here to be real, to be viable,
*06:21.940- 06:26.620* :  credible, and we're watching it as closely as we can. Right now, our focus is on having
*06:26.620- 06:31.300* :  conversations with our Israeli counterparts and making sure that they have what they need,
*06:31.300- 06:36.160* :  they're able to defend themselves, and we're also take a look at our own posture in the region
*06:36.160- 06:39.100* :  to make sure that we're properly prepared as well.
*06:39.460- 06:44.900* :  Well, on Friday, Hasbalah, the Iranian-backed militia in Lebanon, fired rockets into Israel,
*06:45.520- 06:49.980* :  but it wasn't thought to be linked to the latest build-up of tensions, as I heard from James
*06:49.980- 06:55.020* :  Landau in Jerusalem. There has been an exchange of fire. There's been a quite a significant
*06:55.020- 07:02.400* :  amount of rocket fire from Hasbalah forces into northern Israel. Numbers were talking dozens,
*07:03.360- 07:10.760* :  40, 50, something like that, which is a higher, the upper end of what is usual, but it is relatively
*07:10.860- 07:18.440* :  regular. There has been continual exchanges of fire between both sides for many, many months now,
*07:18.440- 07:24.500* :  since the October attack by Hamas. So it is a continuation of that. Hasbalah said that they had
*07:24.500- 07:31.180* :  launched those missiles in response to Israeli attacks on their targets. So at the moment,
*07:31.180- 07:39.180* :  it seems a continuation of an existing scene of cut this conflict. We probably don't think this
*07:39.180- 07:46.960* :  is the beginning of something that potentially could be part of Iran's response to the air strike
*07:46.960- 07:53.580* :  that destroyed Iran's consulate in Damascus. Of course, Israel has been at war for the past
*07:53.580- 07:58.420* :  six months during that time. It's come under attack. What's been the reaction to these warnings
*07:58.420- 08:03.700* :  from the US that Iran might try and attack it directly? Well, I think officially the Israelis are
*08:03.700- 08:08.420* :  taking it very seriously. Behind the scenes preparations are being made. Local authorities are checking
*08:08.420- 08:14.940* :  shelters and things like that. This evening, the head of Israel's army said that his forces were
*08:14.940- 08:19.740* :  fully prepared for whatever security threat they had to face. The Israelis have been talking
*08:20.040- 08:24.420* :  very closely to the Americans, just about the sort of diplomatic response, but also the very
*08:24.420- 08:30.400* :  precise military response. A senior US commander was in Israel today talking to the Israeli defence
*08:30.400- 08:35.220* :  minister. So that's the official response. I have to say the response of people here in Jerusalem
*08:35.220- 08:39.860* :  today. I spent a couple of hours walking the streets, talking to people. They are calm. There is
*08:39.860- 08:44.920* :  absolutely no sense of panic. They were out on the streets enjoying their day off, preparing for
*08:44.920- 08:50.660* :  their Sabbath meals. Shopping was normal. There was absolutely no sense of panic buying or anything
*08:50.660- 08:55.740* :  like that. When I asked people if they were concerned, most people just struck their shoulders and
*08:55.740- 08:59.440* :  said, look, this is what we live with all the time. James Landel in Jerusalem.
*09:00.420- 09:06.040* :  2024 could be the year Ukraine loses its war against Russia. That's the warning from the
*09:06.040- 09:11.340* :  former head of Britain's joint forces command. General Sir Richard Barron says Ukraine desperately
*09:11.340- 09:16.640* :  needs help to defend itself from Russian attacks. President Zelensky says his country doesn't have
*09:16.640- 09:22.460* :  the ammunition needed to counter a coming Russian offensive. But what is Russia's current strategy
*09:22.460- 09:26.520* :  and will it work while security correspondent Frank Gardner has this assessment?
*09:31.740- 09:36.480* :  The all-too-familiar sound of an air raid siren is yet another wave of Russian missiles
*09:36.480- 09:41.420* :  hooms in on their targets. Ukrainians have grown used to this over the last two years,
*09:42.260- 09:48.300* :  but now the war is taking a dangerous new turn. There is a serious risk that this is the year
*09:48.300- 09:53.320* :  Ukraine loses the war. General Sir Richard Barron is the former commander of Britain's joint forces
*09:53.320- 09:58.880* :  command. And the reason this could be the year is because Ukraine may come to feel it can't win
*09:58.880- 10:03.880* :  the war. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die any longer
*10:03.880- 10:09.760* :  just to defend the indefendable? Things are not yet at that point, but Ukraine is running
*10:09.760- 10:19.520* :  critically short of ammunition, artillery and troops. Ukraine's president Zelensky has been making
*10:19.520- 10:24.820* :  increasingly desperate appeals for the West to deliver more air defenses. His country's much
*10:24.820- 10:30.060* :  heralded counter-offensive failed last year to dislodge the Russians from territory they'd seized.
*10:30.280- 10:35.600* :  And now Moscow is gearing up for a summer offensive. So what will this look like,
*10:36.320- 10:40.840* :  Dr. Jack Wattling, a senior research fellow in land warfare at the Whitehall Think Tank,
*10:40.840- 10:45.220* :  Russia? I think the Russian objective is probably to write down the Ukrainian armed forces
*10:45.220- 10:51.500* :  rather than take specific pieces of territory and to try and generate a sense of hopelessness.
*10:51.500- 10:56.080* :  This offensive will not decisively end the conflict irrespective of how it goes,
*10:56.080- 10:59.720* :  it's got either side. But Kharkiv is certainly vulnerable.
*10:59.960- 11:05.680* :  Kharkiv is dangerously close to the Russian border and a city currently being pummeled by Russian
*11:05.680- 11:11.660* :  missiles, generals of rich parents. I think the offensive this year will have breaking out of
*11:11.660- 11:17.960* :  the Donbass as its first objective and the I will be on Harkiv, which is 29 kilometers or so
*11:17.960- 11:24.440* :  from the Russian border. Ukraine's second city, a major prize if Russia can take control of that
*11:24.440- 11:28.660* :  city during the course of this year. Others think that the city of Zaporizha in the south
*11:28.660- 11:34.700* :  could be a target for capture. It is perilously close to the Russian lines and it's in a province
*11:34.700- 11:41.520* :  and oblast that Russia already partly occupies and now claims as its own. Moscow would certainly like
*11:41.520- 11:46.680* :  to capture the port of Odessa if it could, but that's unlikely now its navy has been largely
*11:46.680- 11:51.540* :  driven out of that part of the Black Sea. But Jack Wattling believes the Russians with their
*11:51.540- 11:55.900* :  greater numbers can keep Ukraine guessing as to where they're going to attack.
*11:56.440- 12:00.100* :  One of the challenges the Ukrainians have is that the Russians can choose where they commit
*12:00.100- 12:04.180* :  these resources, where they commit their forces. It's a very long front line and the Ukrainians
*12:04.180- 12:08.620* :  need to be able to defend all of it. One thing is certain, Russia's President Putin
*12:08.620- 12:13.900* :  has no intention of giving up on his assault on Ukraine. He's like a poker player,
*12:13.900- 12:19.840* :  gambling all his chips on a win. He's counting on the West failing to supply Ukraine with
*12:19.840- 12:25.400* :  the sufficient means to defend itself. And despite all the NATO summits, all the conferences
*12:26.020- 12:29.320* :  and all the stirring speeches, he may just be right.
*12:30.120- 12:33.660* :  Frank Gardner. So what's the view in Ukraine itself?
*12:34.360- 12:39.460* :  Alexander Mureshko is a Ukrainian MP and chair of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee.
*12:40.160- 12:45.540* :  Of course, don't share this bleak prospect, this bleak view because, well, first of all,
*12:45.540- 12:52.840* :  yes, of course, we still continue to have the need very strong, very cute need in weaponry,
*12:52.840- 12:58.240* :  especially when it comes to air defense systems. But at the same time, we're actively getting ready
*12:58.240- 13:03.760* :  for Russian possible offensive. And we are optimistic because the Russia so far has been
*13:03.760- 13:11.540* :  unable to take big city with exception of maruble, of course. And Russia is not able to control
*13:11.540- 13:17.860* :  the occupied territories. We will continue very effectively to repel Russian attacks and to
*13:17.860- 13:23.760* :  defend our territory. At the same time, we are becoming more determined and have more
*13:23.760- 13:28.980* :  resolve to continue our fighting because, after all, what's our alternative? What are the
*13:28.980- 13:33.900* :  options? We don't have any other options. If we stop fighting, we'll be killed by Russians.
*13:34.540- 13:40.240* :  And we continue to hope that the United States, our closest friend and partner, will
*13:40.620- 13:44.600* :  continue to provide us with the necessary aid because the stakes are too high.
*13:44.920- 13:47.280* :  Ukrainian MP Alexander Modeshko
*13:48.080- 13:52.820* :  Next to a protest against the growth of tourism on the Spanish holiday island of Tenerife.
*13:58.840- 14:03.340* :  The demonstrators, some of whom have gone on hunger strike, are calling for a halt to the
*14:03.340- 14:08.360* :  construction of a hotel and beach resort in the south of Tenerife. They're part of a wider movement
*14:08.360- 14:14.920* :  across the Canary Islands called Canaryas Seagota. The Canaries have had enough and more protests
*14:14.920- 14:21.540* :  are planned. Nearly 14 million tourists visited the islands last year, six times the population.
*14:21.540- 14:28.220* :  I heard more from Guy Hedgeko in Madrid. These campaigners say that it's not just about
*14:28.220- 14:33.700* :  those two projects. It's about the issue of tourism in general, not just in Tenerife, but
*14:34.720- 14:39.440* :  across the Canary Islands. And they say that the islands have been overwhelmed by tourism
*14:39.440- 14:44.160* :  in recent years. It's made the islands almost uninhabitable for the locals as what they claim.
*14:44.960- 14:49.940* :  And they say it's having a huge impact on the environment of the islands, which are known
*14:49.940- 14:55.200* :  for their natural beauty. And they also say there's a social and economic element to this in that
*14:55.200- 15:01.040* :  this is driving up housing prices for local people as well. So for several different reasons,
*15:01.040- 15:07.820* :  local people are angry about this issue. And are these protests likely to cause a
*15:07.820- 15:13.020* :  rethink in how tourists are attracted to the islands? Well, certainly this draws attention
*15:13.060- 15:20.880* :  to the issue. Previously, there had been campaigns, there had been some protests, but nothing
*15:20.880- 15:28.600* :  quite like this. There is a feeling that this is a much bigger expression of anger. And it's not
*15:28.600- 15:35.880* :  just about the people carrying out the protest in Tenerife. It's also a broader movement across
*15:35.880- 15:42.540* :  the islands. And that movement is planning demonstrations a few days from now across the islands.
*15:42.600- 15:47.260* :  And they are saying that those are going to be very big demonstrations, which you would imagine
*15:47.260- 15:52.200* :  would really get the attention, not just of the authorities, but also potentially of tourists
*15:52.200- 15:57.380* :  or people thinking of coming to the islands as well. Yeah, tourism, big business, not just for
*15:57.380- 16:03.080* :  the canaries, but for for much of Spain. How is the government responding to this? Well, so far,
*16:03.080- 16:07.940* :  we only heard from the local government, rather than the national government, the local authorities
*16:07.940- 16:13.580* :  and the Canary Islands seem to be in this rather difficult situation because on the one hand,
*16:13.620- 16:18.960* :  they've been emphasising how important tourism is for the Canary Islands. They say it makes up
*16:18.960- 16:27.100* :  around 35% of the economy of the islands, around 40% of the island's jobs are linked to tourism.
*16:27.100- 16:33.060* :  So they've been underlining that massive importance that tourism has. But they've also been
*16:33.060- 16:37.660* :  trying to express a certain amount of sympathy for the people who are protesting, saying that they
*16:37.660- 16:43.880* :  understand their anger and Fernando Clavico, who's the president, the regional president of the Canary
*16:43.880- 16:49.660* :  Islands, has said that maybe these protests are an opportunity to look at the island's economic
*16:49.660- 16:57.360* :  model and think about it. I'm a dread-correspondent Guy Hedgeco. And still to come on the global news
*16:57.360- 17:03.440* :  podcast, there's probably quite a few people out there thinking that all Norwegian politicians
*17:03.440- 17:11.000* :  are cheated, self-obsessed and untrustworthy, but that is not the truth. Another plagiarism scandal
*17:11.240- 17:11.820* :  in Norway
*17:56.260- 18:00.880* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are
*18:00.880- 18:05.780* :  allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising prices
*18:05.780- 18:10.480* :  technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking
*18:10.480- 18:15.380* :  about? You insane Hollywood s**t. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from
*18:15.380- 18:20.560* :  $30 a month to just $15 a month. Give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch.
*18:32.360- 18:37.460* :  In southern Russia, flood waters are reaching extremely dangerous levels according to the authorities.
*18:37.460- 18:43.000* :  The mayor of one city's even ordered people to evacuate immediately. Many buildings in the area
*18:43.000- 18:48.700* :  and across the border in Kazakhstan are already underwater. This man said he was shocked by the
*18:48.700- 18:57.200* :  severity of the flooding. I've lived here all my life and this is the first time a flood
*18:57.200- 19:03.620* :  like this has happened here. The last flood was in 1993 and it was much smaller. The water in the
*19:03.620- 19:09.140* :  yard was only up to the knees just a little bit and that's all. There has never been anything like this.
*19:09.780- 19:15.020* :  Oleg Boulder, from the BBC Russian Service, gave James Menendez an update on the situation in
*19:15.020- 19:20.680* :  Orinburg near the southern Russian border with Kazakhstan. Well, Orinburg has been enduring
*19:20.680- 19:27.080* :  ever-rising water for the past three days. The water is now two meters over the mark which is
*19:27.080- 19:33.860* :  considered critical. A vast area, a depression really, not a ravine, but a depression. The
*19:33.860- 19:39.880* :  kilometer and a half across has been filled with water and this is the area full of small private houses.
*19:40.700- 19:47.200* :  Not necessarily old. Some of them have been built to high standard and are standing up to the
*19:47.200- 19:54.120* :  eaves of the roofs in water. The big question for everyone is whether the water will in and
*19:54.120- 20:00.940* :  date the high-rise buildings, one particular smart residential complex which has been by now
*20:00.940- 20:06.880* :  ironically called riverside. And people in homes that are being threatened, what may be just
*20:06.920- 20:10.480* :  told to get out as soon as possible. I think what sirens have been sounding too?
*20:11.380- 20:16.980* :  Yeah, the sirens have been sounding for two days now. It's fair to say that people have gotten the
*20:16.980- 20:22.960* :  message from what's been happening upstream in the city of Orsk. Now, Orsk has been flooded with
*20:23.360- 20:29.340* :  very little warning. The water has breached a dam and I just started pouring it and the man's
*20:29.340- 20:35.360* :  speed and all people could have done is grab the passport and the cat and run away. In Orenburg,
*20:35.360- 20:41.320* :  at least they knew what was coming. A lot of people do still remain in their homes,
*20:41.320- 20:47.480* :  some are afraid of looters. Some say they have got nowhere to go. I've seen a few men sitting
*20:47.500- 20:53.640* :  in the attic of those one or two story houses hoping that the water will go down. So maybe from
*20:53.640- 20:58.720* :  tomorrow the water will start receding and then obviously counting the losses will start.
*20:59.140- 21:04.760* :  And we already know from the local government that the damage is 40 billion rubles. Now,
*21:04.760- 21:09.340* :  without any conversion to dollars, I'll tell you that this is one third of regional yearly budget
*21:09.340- 21:13.920* :  for these coming years. And now, like, as we heard from that man, the clip that we probably
*21:13.920- 21:17.980* :  said he'd never seen anything like this. Why are things, why is the flooding so bad this year?
*21:19.180- 21:24.860* :  Well, the man should have spoken to his father. The region has seen very disastrous floods. It's
*21:24.860- 21:30.160* :  a matter of debate whether the water was setting as high, but the human toll was horrible in 1957,
*21:30.780- 21:38.120* :  in 1942. In 1922, this is the region which is prone to flooding. The river Ural, which in other
*21:38.120- 21:44.940* :  times is mandering kind of through, can take those, you know, meltwater from the hills, many, many
*21:44.940- 21:51.460* :  miles upstream. And it's just a very unfortunate coincidence that's been a lot of snow in the hills
*21:51.460- 21:58.880* :  and that the spring came very suddenly. The melting is very fast. Obviously, there is a question
*21:58.880- 22:03.740* :  of how much coordination between different services and at least given the warning to people,
*22:03.740- 22:09.180* :  so they could, you know, they have time to leave. But it seems like nothing could have stopped
*22:09.180- 22:15.540* :  the water itself coming. I like Belderov from the BBC Russian service. From November, people in
*22:15.540- 22:20.560* :  Germany will find it much easier to change their legal gender after Parliament passed a new law
*22:20.560- 22:26.000* :  simplifying the procedure. The German Chancellor said it showed respect for trans, intersex,
*22:26.000- 22:32.720* :  and non-binary people. Nikoslav VK, transgender woman MP from the Green Party spoke in the debate.
*22:33.380- 22:43.740* :  It's about time that we put an end to the injustice of the unnecessarily long expert opinions
*22:43.740- 22:50.180* :  and court proceedings for people to change names and that we finally respect the dignity of trans,
*22:50.180- 22:56.940* :  inter, and non-binary people today. The law brings Germany into line with the likes of Belgium,
*22:56.940- 23:03.440* :  Spain and Denmark, but some in the German Parliament objected. Martin Reinhardt is an MP for the far
*23:03.440- 23:14.060* :  right AFD party. Suddenly, everyone should be able to be everything, be anything at any time and
*23:14.060- 23:19.820* :  even retroactively, denying their own history. But a man does not become a woman when he puts on a
*23:19.820- 23:25.840* :  wig and a cliched low-cut dress, which in reality only reflects his own stereotype of femininity to
*23:25.840- 23:31.060* :  the outside world, ladies and gentlemen. Are Europe regional editor Danny Eberhardt told me more
*23:31.060- 23:37.040* :  about the proposed changes? Up to now, people have had to submit to two psychological assessments
*23:37.760- 23:44.260* :  and then go to a court and get their gender changed by the court. And that has offended
*23:44.260- 23:51.260* :  lots of people in the transgender non-binary intersex communities because, for example,
*23:51.260- 23:57.420* :  they say they're not sick for a start, and they're just people, and they've been trying to get
*23:57.420- 24:02.960* :  this through. So many transgender rights activists have seen this, at least as a partial success
*24:02.960- 24:10.580* :  to wider rights. But what they can do now, they must go to make a declaration, and then three
*24:10.580- 24:15.400* :  months later they can go to a registry office to change their name and their legal gender.
*24:15.860- 24:24.020* :  It's more complicated for miners, so basically people who are under 14, the parents have to submit
*24:24.020- 24:29.680* :  that application, and people between 14 and 18 can submit the application themselves, but it must
*24:29.680- 24:34.880* :  have parental approval. Now, as we heard, there was some opposition in Parliament. What is the view
*24:34.880- 24:41.660* :  of the public? In 2022, there was a study that actually said that about 46 percent of people were
*24:41.660- 24:48.120* :  in favour of this sort of system, and 41 percent were against. So there is a division in the public,
*24:48.540- 24:54.260* :  but Germany traditionally has come out fairly well in terms of public perceptions of trans rights.
*24:54.920- 25:02.040* :  So one study, going back a bit now to 2016, was put it at 68 on a school where Spain was the
*25:02.040- 25:09.380* :  highest of more than 20 countries surveyed with an index of 74, and Russia was the lowest at 41.
*25:10.000- 25:15.520* :  Is this the way that Europe is generally going now? Broadly, there are more countries that are
*25:15.540- 25:22.480* :  allowing self-determination. So Denmark was the first in 2014. Spain, last year passed a law that
*25:22.480- 25:28.400* :  allowed people over 16 to change their gender without medical evaluation, but other countries are
*25:28.400- 25:34.780* :  much more restrictive. So Hungary, for example, has outlawed changing the birth gender on documents,
*25:34.780- 25:39.420* :  so much more restrictive there, and obviously Russia too. Now, you're a regional editor, Danny
*25:39.420- 25:45.340* :  Abard. The health minister in Norway has had to resign after being accused of plagiarism in her
*25:45.340- 25:51.520* :  university thesis. She is the second Norwegian minister to quit after facing allegations of copying.
*25:52.120- 25:55.580* :  So what do the public make of it? Stephanie Zacherson has the story.
*25:56.380- 26:02.900* :  That is Mr Schluppe Katta Utasacken. Well, the counts out of the bag, in Rylsharkov said,
*26:03.380- 26:07.940* :  right after it was announced that she's having to leave her post as minister for health and care
*26:07.940- 26:13.900* :  services. The decision was made after an investigation found that she'd plagiarised parts of her
*26:13.900- 26:20.180* :  master's thesis that she published in 2021. The board also concluded that it hadn't been an
*26:20.180- 26:26.440* :  honest mistake, but called it an intentional one. The thesis, which was about digital transformation
*26:26.440- 26:32.040* :  within the home care sector, has now been cancelled and removed from Nord University's website.
*26:32.880- 26:37.460* :  England Schluppe claimed that she hadn't cheated, and said it was hard not to be believed,
*26:37.460- 26:42.320* :  but accepted the findings. Norway's prime minister, Jonas Gostorra,
*26:42.640- 26:46.760* :  called her a hard-working politician, who's represented the best of their party,
*26:47.240- 26:50.580* :  but said that it would be impossible for her to stay on in government.
*26:51.220- 26:56.780* :  This is only a few months after Sunderborg, the former minister of research in higher education,
*26:57.340- 27:02.040* :  admitted to having plagiarised parts of her thesis. In her Rowling government,
*27:02.040- 27:07.340* :  she had been going after students accused of cheating, but when a student started looking at
*27:07.340- 27:13.160* :  the minister's own credentials, the plagiarism was found and Sunderborg resigned in January.
*27:13.620- 27:20.660* :  So what would this mean for the public's trust in politicians? Spain engrotte van is a member
*27:20.660- 27:26.660* :  of Parliament for vencer, the Liberal Party. There's probably quite a few people out there
*27:26.660- 27:31.860* :  thinking that all Norwegian politicians are cheated, self-obsessed, and untrustworthy,
*27:31.860- 27:38.360* :  but that is not the truth. Most, including England's shackle, are hard-working, conscientious people,
*27:38.920- 27:43.880* :  and it is human to make a mistake. So when you do, you have to face the consequences.
*27:47.380- 27:52.360* :  Of course, Norwegian politicians aren't the only ones who have been caught bending the truth
*27:52.360- 27:58.040* :  in their publications. Several German politicians have stepped down from different roles after they
*27:58.040- 28:04.640* :  were found cheating. The Hungarian president, Palschmit, was stripped of his doctorate and subsequently
*28:04.640- 28:10.280* :  resigned from his post because of plagiarism. And Luxembourg's former prime minister,
*28:10.280- 28:16.500* :  Havje Batell, chose to give up his postgraduate degree after a report found that an overwhelming
*28:16.500- 28:22.520* :  majority of the work was plagiarised, just to mention a few examples out there.
*28:22.940- 28:29.140* :  Stephanie Zacherson, all her own work, of course. It is four months since Havje Mille took office as
*28:29.140- 28:34.400* :  president of Argentina, South America's second largest economy. One of his biggest goals has been
*28:34.400- 28:39.620* :  to get to grips with high inflation, but his economic medicine has proved painful for many.
*28:40.200- 28:42.960* :  As Natalia Kosoj reports from the Argentine capital.
*28:44.900- 28:49.280* :  Close to midday, on a weekday, I visited an elegant fish restaurant in Buenos Aires called
*28:49.280- 28:57.260* :  Dambli, that has been in business for the past 25 years. His owner, Gustavo Cano, says that even
*28:57.260- 29:02.080* :  though last year's inflation was also high, things are different in 2024.
*29:03.900- 29:10.260* :  Last Saturday was a very good day. We are surprised now with days like that, yet there was no
*29:10.260- 29:15.600* :  wine on every table, which used to be normal for a Saturday night. That's a sign that business
*29:15.600- 29:22.260* :  has contracted, and I had a worse April than last year. I had the worst Easter of the past 10 years.
*29:22.500- 29:24.480* :  People are being careful with their money.
*29:25.900- 29:31.320* :  Baslou d'Angustavo, says in his restaurant, is taking place all over the economy. Retired,
*29:31.320- 29:36.260* :  people have been hit particularly hard by the government's program. To protest their situation,
*29:36.260- 29:42.600* :  some pensioners recently decided to camp in a white tent in front of Congress. Among them was
*29:42.600- 29:49.180* :  Julia Contreras, who is 62 years old, and earns the minimum pension, which is just above the poverty line.
*29:53.180- 29:58.340* :  I can't take my grandchildren out. I could not buy them an Easter egg because if I bought them an
*29:58.340- 30:02.480* :  Easter egg, I wouldn't eat. I can't make it to the end of the month.
*30:05.540- 30:10.840* :  Pensioners like Julia are some of the most vulnerable people in Argentina. Plenty need regular
*30:10.840- 30:16.220* :  medical attention, and are cared for in public hospitals which serve the poorest sectors of the
*30:16.220- 30:21.980* :  population. One of the largest ones is the Hospital de Clinicas. Luis Melo, its director,
*30:22.600- 30:26.480* :  is very worried that because of the freeze in its budget decided by the government,
*30:26.480- 30:33.220* :  they will be unable to properly treat the 360,000 patients that they serve every year.
*30:33.460- 30:39.200* :  The price of medications increased by a thousand percent, and we have a budget that's
*30:39.200- 30:44.700* :  lagging by 270 percent. We decided to buy a portion of what we needed. Health care is
*30:44.700- 30:50.000* :  receding. Once we could compare ourselves with any hospital in the world, and now we're moving
*30:50.300- 30:57.840* :  backwards. And in his restaurant, Gustavo Cano, Cisquiz Business, going through one of its
*30:57.840- 31:06.720* :  hardest times. I can no longer pass on price increases to my customers. I prefer to keep my clientele
*31:06.720- 31:12.960* :  without making them feel that the menu prices change every week or month. I aim to maintain
*31:12.960- 31:19.120* :  employment, sacrificing the business's profit margin to be able to cover salaries. My concern
*31:19.120- 31:25.760* :  today is trying not to have to put money out of my own pocket in. In this context of
*31:25.760- 31:30.440* :  combined inflation and recession, Argentinians are barely making ends meet. Nevertheless,
*31:30.440- 31:36.500* :  trust in President Milay is surprisingly still high. Natalia Kosoi in Buenos Aires.
*31:37.500- 31:41.620* :  The world of fashion has been paying tribute to the Italian designer Roberto Cavali,
*31:41.620- 31:47.300* :  who's died at the age of 83. He rose to prominence in the 1970s when he launched his fashion
*31:47.300- 31:52.860* :  brand and opened a small store in Santa Pei, dressing stars like Sirfila Ren and Brigitte Bardot.
*31:53.020- 31:59.060* :  He became known for his flamboyant patterns, flowing hippie dresses and exotic animal prints.
*31:59.060- 32:04.580* :  Sergio Amani called him a true artist and said his tusken verb would be missed.
*32:04.860- 32:10.400* :  This is how Roberto Cavali himself described a perfect look during one of his fashion shows in 2013.
*32:16.940- 32:23.620* :  Santa Pei is a ninja. I will wear this kind of dress, so sexy. And in the evening,
*32:24.360- 32:31.800* :  you will go out in the best discotheque with Roberto Cavali dress, short or long.
*32:32.860- 32:40.420* :  With a special makeup, you know, that is really the complete Cavali look.
*32:41.560- 32:44.980* :  Fashion designer Roberto Cavali, who's died at the age of 83.
*32:47.100- 32:51.580* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back at the same time tomorrow.
