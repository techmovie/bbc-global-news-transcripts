*01:19.060- 01:22.300* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.920- 01:30.340* :  I'm Rachel Wright and in the early hours of Thursday, the 25th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:30.340- 01:35.140* :  As pro-Palestinian demonstrations spread across US university campuses,
*01:35.620- 01:38.360* :  the US House Speaker demands protests must stop.
*01:38.900- 01:43.120* :  President Zelensky welcomes the long-awaited US aid package to Ukraine.
*01:43.620- 01:46.880* :  We ask how likely is his to change events on the ground.
*01:49.760- 01:55.180* :  Also in this podcast, Portugal's surprised Mayor Culper, as it says it wants to take full
*01:55.180- 01:59.240* :  responsibility for its involvement in the slave trade. And...
*01:59.240- 02:04.480* :  And he said, did you go to Cardinal and Gram School in Liverpool? I go, yeah, he says,
*02:05.200- 02:09.500* :  James, it's me, Colin. And we just feel we've got so much that you know to do.
*02:10.100- 02:13.400* :  Our reconnecting with old friends is not always easy.
*02:18.520- 02:23.880* :  The ripples of the Israel-Palestinian conflict have spread across the world, causing massive
*02:23.880- 02:29.640* :  demonstrations in capital cities throughout Europe. But in the US, it's taken on a new dimension,
*02:29.640- 02:36.420* :  with protests at universities across the country. On Wednesday, pro-Palestinian demonstrators clashed
*02:36.420- 02:42.160* :  with police at universities in Texas and California. And at Columbia University in New York,
*02:42.160- 02:46.560* :  where more than 100 students were arrested at a protest encampment last week,
*02:46.560- 02:50.160* :  the House Speaker, Mike Johnson, said the protest must end.
*02:50.300- 02:57.300* :  Sadly, Columbia's administrators have chosen to let the threats, the fear, and the intimidation
*02:57.300- 03:01.980* :  of the mob rule to overtake American principles like free speech and the free,
*03:02.700- 03:08.780* :  free exchange of ideas and the free exercise of religion. They have co-opted first amendment arguments
*03:08.780- 03:16.600* :  to protect genocide and to elevate the voices of anti-Semitism. They have proven themselves to be
*03:16.600- 03:21.720* :  incapable of achieving their basic responsibility, which is keeping students safe.
*03:22.920- 03:27.240* :  We just can't allow this kind of hatred and anti-Semitism to flourish on our campuses,
*03:27.780- 03:32.460* :  and it must be stopped in its tracks. Those who are perpetrating this violence should be arrested.
*03:33.000- 03:39.060* :  And I'm here today, I am here today joining my colleagues and calling on President Shafi
*03:39.060- 03:43.300* :  to resign if she cannot immediately bring order to this chaos.
*03:43.740- 03:50.340* :  As Speaker of the House, I am committing today that the Congress will not be silent,
*03:50.340- 03:55.880* :  as fewer students are expected to run for their lives and stay home from their classes hiding
*03:55.880- 04:01.840* :  in fear. Protests have also been happening at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles,
*04:02.300- 04:04.780* :  a correspondent, Emma Vardy, spoke to me from there.
*04:06.020- 04:10.420* :  Well, this is a campus among a number of campuses that have seen more demonstrations today.
*04:10.420- 04:14.820* :  Protesters were here in Los Angeles on campus from about 8 o'clock this morning.
*04:15.160- 04:19.020* :  There were protesters who had seemed to have put up some tents. They were asked to take those
*04:19.140- 04:25.660* :  down. That led to some clashes between protesters and police. It seems one student, one protester at
*04:25.660- 04:30.640* :  least was detained. Those did seem to calm down though. And then for the next few hours,
*04:30.640- 04:35.360* :  this demonstration has been going off pretty peacefully, although around me now there are
*04:35.720- 04:41.040* :  campus police. But as students I've been speaking to here say actually the protest has grown in
*04:41.040- 04:45.940* :  numbers and support has been galvanized really by what's been happening elsewhere in the United
*04:45.940- 04:52.620* :  States. The arrests that happened in Colombia, in Texas have helped to, I suppose, attract more
*04:52.620- 04:57.460* :  people to these protests. We heard earlier that the House Speaker's called for the resignation of
*04:57.460- 05:03.020* :  the head of Columbia University and called for protests to end. Has there been any reaction to
*05:03.020- 05:09.260* :  that from where you are? Well, pro-Palestinian activists here and students, well they feel that
*05:09.260- 05:14.060* :  free speech is being shut down. But then you have Jewish students here saying they actually feel
*05:14.060- 05:19.100* :  threatened on campus. So it's an extremely difficult balance to strike. And a particular point
*05:19.100- 05:26.000* :  of tension here in California was that the USC University cancelled the speech of the valedictorian.
*05:26.000- 05:31.620* :  So that's the top graduate of the year because she was accused of anti-Semitic comments. So they
*05:32.040- 05:37.240* :  shut down her speech and cancelled some other speakers. And then that too helps to inflame
*05:37.240- 05:42.240* :  tensions with protesters. There's people here holding placards, not just about the general issue
*05:42.240- 05:47.580* :  of the war in Gaza, but actually about the valedictorian speech being cancelled too. So on an
*05:47.580- 05:52.960* :  individual level, the action that campuses and universities are taking, it's very difficult
*05:52.960- 05:59.160* :  for them to get the balance right in each place. Emabadi at the University of Southern California
*05:59.160- 06:03.980* :  in Los Angeles. And we'll have more on the conflict in Gaza later in the podcast.
*06:05.100- 06:10.280* :  After President Biden signed the long awaited military aid package to Ukraine into law,
*06:10.280- 06:15.880* :  he said military assistance would be sent to Ukraine within hours. He told reporters that the aid
*06:15.880- 06:23.000* :  worth $61 billion would make the world a safer place. This weekend, for reports, Mrs.
*06:23.000- 06:29.980* :  I find this amazing. The reports of cheers breaking out of the trenches in eastern Ukraine as they
*06:29.980- 06:34.920* :  watch the house flow in support of Ukraine. It's not like they don't understand what we've done,
*06:35.740- 06:39.540* :  not like they don't understand how critical this is for them. I'm making sure the shipment
*06:39.540- 06:44.860* :  starts right away. In the next few hours, literally a few hours, we're going to begin sending in
*06:44.860- 06:52.020* :  equipment to Ukraine for air defense munitions, for artillery, for rocket systems and armored vehicles.
*06:52.620- 06:58.060* :  In his nightly video address, Ukraine's president Vladimir Zelensky said the support would help
*06:58.060- 07:09.660* :  sustain his country's fight against Russia's invasion. These days, we have been working as
*07:09.660- 07:14.360* :  hard as possible with our American friends at all levels to quickly fill this package from
*07:14.360- 07:19.080* :  the United States with exactly the kind of weapons that our soldiers need. From Army,
*07:19.080- 07:24.360* :  tactical missile systems and artillery, from anti-tank weapons and high mobility artillery rocket
*07:24.360- 07:29.980* :  system missiles, to much needed air defense and equipment. I am grateful to President Biden and
*07:29.980- 07:34.620* :  Congress, to all Americans who feel the need to knock the grind out from under Putin's feet.
*07:39.400- 07:44.680* :  Anastasia lives in Kharkiv in the northeast of Ukraine about 30 kilometers from the border with
*07:44.680- 07:50.060* :  Russia. It has suffered frequent Russian air strikes. She told us what she thought about the
*07:50.060- 07:59.380* :  prospect of the arrival of more US arms. I am very careful and cautious about this, because there's
*07:59.380- 08:07.500* :  been a lot of talk and a lot of speculation and a lot of waiting. And maybe I will feel a bit
*08:07.500- 08:14.880* :  better ones. I know that it's here actually because of how long it takes for something actually
*08:14.880- 08:23.100* :  to get here and for the population to feel that something is improving. So I guess no one dares
*08:24.040- 08:32.280* :  hope and feel happier until the moment they see something that is just helping people's
*08:32.520- 08:38.540* :  see people suffering less, see less destruction. So we are hopeful but very cautious about this.
*08:39.280- 08:44.020* :  So how much is this package likely to change events on the ground? I've been speaking to our
*08:44.020- 08:48.760* :  security correspondent, Frank Gardner. It will make a difference but it's not going to win
*08:48.760- 08:53.420* :  Ukraine the war and I think it's important to have a bit of reality check. It's a massive relief
*08:53.420- 08:59.340* :  to Ukraine because without this so-called supplementary aid package, Ukraine was quite possibly
*08:59.340- 09:06.080* :  going to lose this war this year or at least find it very hard to repel a Russian advance that
*09:06.080- 09:12.360* :  could take Kharkiv or advance almost as far as the Deneepur. Now that's an extreme case but
*09:12.360- 09:18.820* :  they were really hard pushed. They lack something that Russia has got mass. And what this aid package
*09:18.820- 09:25.360* :  will do is replenish those Ukrainian stocks and air defense missiles. Russia has been absolutely
*09:25.360- 09:32.400* :  pummeling Ukraine with a combination of drones and missiles and over 8,000 of these glide bombs.
*09:32.420- 09:37.460* :  These things are wreaking havoc on the front lines. They're old converted Soviet dumb bombs
*09:37.460- 09:43.500* :  that have been fitted with fins and GPS that then launched from Russian territory and glide up
*09:43.500- 09:49.100* :  to 40 kilometers towards Ukrainian positions. And these things are carrying up 3,000 kilos of high
*09:49.100- 09:53.860* :  explosive. Now you can be the best Ukrainian super soldier in the world with the best modern NATO
*09:53.860- 09:58.200* :  kit. You're not going to survive a hit on your position with that. Obviously there's been a massive
*09:58.200- 10:04.440* :  delay in this package. How damaging has that been to Ukraine? Critically damaging. It was getting
*10:04.440- 10:09.800* :  to the point just before this where Ukrainians were starting to mutter some pretty dark words about
*10:09.800- 10:14.920* :  the United States because about feeling abandoned that the US had turned its back on them. All because
*10:15.080- 10:19.960* :  this hardcore Republicans were blocking the passage of this bill. But that has now passed.
*10:20.600- 10:26.320* :  But in the meantime, Russia has taken over 500 square kilometers of territory. That's a lot. It's
*10:26.320- 10:32.320* :  it's significant. And they were threatening places that would give them access to some of the
*10:32.320- 10:36.920* :  really big strategic cities in the east. I mean, I don't think anybody was talking about Keith
*10:36.920- 10:42.600* :  being overrun. But nevertheless, it was a very dangerous time. Six months have been lost in this.
*10:43.100- 10:47.880* :  And remember that Ukraine just wants to get this over with. I know it's a popular thing in the West
*10:47.880- 10:52.640* :  to say, oh, you know, why don't they just do a peace deal? Ukrainians have got no appetite for
*10:52.640- 10:59.120* :  that because they don't trust Russia and be a peace deal would mean letting President Putin hang
*10:59.120- 11:04.000* :  on to not any crime here. But all the territory they've seized so far and illegally annexed.
*11:04.400- 11:10.160* :  And they just think that Russia will simply use a peace deal to rearm, replenish and come back
*11:10.160- 11:13.720* :  and gobble up the rest. If it doesn't help them win them more, do you think this will have an
*11:13.720- 11:18.240* :  enormous effect on the morale? We heard President Biden saying there were people cheering on the
*11:18.240- 11:23.200* :  front lines. It's yes, it's got a massive effect on Ukraine and morale. Some people have even
*11:23.200- 11:29.040* :  compared it to when America came into the war on the side of the Allies into December 1941.
*11:29.040- 11:35.260* :  This is a huge package. Very significant. And it breaks down really into three areas. Air
*11:35.260- 11:43.280* :  defence are artillery and rockets. So missiles. So all of that are the essential ingredients to
*11:43.280- 11:47.460* :  the way this war is fought. So what they've been doing and trying to overwhelm Ukrainian
*11:47.460- 11:56.240* :  defences is to send a hold of these very cheap mass-produced Iranian design Shahid drones which
*11:56.240- 12:03.620* :  will then confuse or take up the attention of Ukraine's air defence radar and then follow it up
*12:03.620- 12:08.160* :  with bigger missiles, cruise missiles, sometimes even ballistic missiles to try and catch the
*12:08.160- 12:15.700* :  enemy off guard. So this package will allow Ukraine to deal with that threat. It's not going to
*12:15.700- 12:20.980* :  eliminate it, but it will make it easier. Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner.
*12:21.760- 12:26.480* :  One of the Western concerns during the Ukraine war has been the support that Russia has been
*12:26.480- 12:32.520* :  receiving from China. Today the American Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, began a visit to China
*12:32.520- 12:38.660* :  as the US ramps up pressure on its rival over that support while also seeking to manage tensions
*12:38.660- 12:43.920* :  with Beijing. Our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman is traveling with Mr Blinken.
*12:46.980- 12:52.160* :  Anthony Blinken started his trip at a basketball match, almost too close to call as the Shanghai
*12:52.160- 12:59.160* :  Sharks lost by a single point to the Zhijian Golden Balls. This moment featuring the US delegation in
*12:59.160- 13:05.220* :  a crowd of Chinese sports fans was supposed to show cultural connections on a trip whose backdrop
*13:05.220- 13:11.680* :  has instead been crackling with political tensions and rivalry. Both sides are keen for now to
*13:11.680- 13:17.980* :  stabilize the US-China relationship in an increasingly uncertain and dangerous world. Mr Blinken
*13:17.980- 13:22.740* :  will spend a day in Shanghai then fly to Beijing where he will urge foreign minister Wang Ye
*13:22.740- 13:28.980* :  to curb Chinese exports of machine tools and microchips to Russia. The US says the
*13:28.980- 13:34.820* :  components are being used to make weapons for the war in Ukraine equals China the primary contributor
*13:34.820- 13:41.960* :  to Russia's military industrial base. Beijing calls that a groundless accusation and American hypocrisy
*13:42.340- 13:46.700* :  days after Congress voted to send billions of dollars in lethal assistance to Kiev.
*13:47.360- 13:51.880* :  They'll also be talks about avoiding confrontation in the South China Sea and the Taiwan
*13:51.880- 13:57.640* :  Strait and about a path to peace in the Middle East. At the same time there's distrust and a
*13:57.640- 14:03.380* :  series of disputes about trade and about the export of Chinese chemicals helping to fuel America's
*14:03.380- 14:10.220* :  synthetic opioid crisis. It is barely a year since the US shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon
*14:10.220- 14:16.220* :  over American waters causing relations to sour. An American photo opportunity at the Shanghai
*14:16.220- 14:22.100* :  Basketball might have been one way to try to soften Washington's image but Chinese officials
*14:22.100- 14:27.580* :  didn't join Mr Blinken there. Instead both sides see this as a moment for standing firm
*14:28.140- 14:31.880* :  what each accuses the other of having made an unleveled playing field.
*14:32.740- 14:39.500* :  Our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman, meanwhile TikTok could be banned in the US as a
*14:39.500- 14:45.420* :  result of a measure backed by the US Senate. The social media apps Chinese owners have said they'll
*14:45.420- 14:51.800* :  challenge the order in court. Meanwhile TikTok is suspending the Rewards program on its light app
*14:51.800- 14:56.240* :  while it addresses concerns that it could be addictive, especially for children.
*14:56.800- 15:01.440* :  The European Union had launched an investigation into the feature, Chris Fallant's reports.
*15:02.400- 15:06.300* :  The Rewards program in the TikTok Light app, which recently rolled out in France and Spain,
*15:06.740- 15:11.640* :  allows users to earn a few pennies a day in the form of vouchers, gift tokens or tips to other
*15:11.640- 15:18.060* :  TikTokers in return for watching videos. But the European Union said it would suspend the app
*15:18.080- 15:23.640* :  if TikTok failed to convince it was safe. Now a day before threatened action, TikTok has voluntarily
*15:23.640- 15:29.720* :  suspended the Rewards program while it addresses the EU's concerns. The firm has always denied it
*15:29.720- 15:35.380* :  was addictive and says it's not available to under 18's and has daily limits on video watch
*15:35.380- 15:40.860* :  tasks. EU industry chief Tieri Breton said investigations would continue warning
*15:41.320- 15:45.760* :  our children are not guinea pigs for social media. Chris Fallant's
*15:46.580- 15:53.100* :  now to a tale of alleged murder, rape, force evictions and elephants. It all centers on the Roja
*15:53.100- 15:58.660* :  National Park in Tanzania, the biggest park in East Africa, and home to the country's
*15:58.660- 16:04.140* :  largest concentration of elephants. As a result of serious allegations of abuse, the World Bank
*16:04.140- 16:09.960* :  has suspended a massive 50 million dollars of investment into expanding the park, which is
*16:09.960- 16:16.140* :  located in southern Tanzania. Our Africa regional editor Will Ross told me what prompted the World
*16:16.140- 16:22.140* :  Bank to take this action? Well, this story's been rumbling along for quite a while. Last year,
*16:22.140- 16:28.680* :  a US-based think tank called the Oakland Institute came out with a report that made a series of
*16:28.680- 16:35.220* :  allegations at some of which were concerning what's going on in that very park and included
*16:36.200- 16:39.960* :  allegations that some of the people who were living in the park were basically being
*16:39.980- 16:47.320* :  forced out in different ways through the use of violence and through forcing their cattle away
*16:47.320- 16:53.040* :  from the park so they'd have to leave as well. But they also included in their report allegations
*16:53.060- 16:59.540* :  of rape by some of the rangers who were working in the park who have benefited from some of this
*16:59.540- 17:07.100* :  World Bank funding and also allegations of some deaths as well inside the park. So a long series
*17:07.100- 17:12.860* :  of allegations then the World Bank said they were going to look into them and then just this week
*17:12.860- 17:18.460* :  they've now said well we've looked into them and they're so serious and we are not going to pay
*17:18.460- 17:25.000* :  any more into this fund which total was supposed to be 150 million but as you say 50 million
*17:25.000- 17:30.340* :  still to be paid. And what's the Tanzanian government said about this? Well the Tanzanian
*17:30.340- 17:36.000* :  government has come out with a fairly straightforward statement just saying we deny all of these
*17:36.000- 17:43.720* :  allegations our government is not behind any of these abuses it hasn't for instance talked about
*17:43.720- 17:48.240* :  any kind of investigation that it wants to carry out but it simply said that the expansion
*17:49.000- 17:54.280* :  of this park and it's supposed to be doubling in size it said that project is still going to go
*17:54.280- 18:00.160* :  ahead despite the fact that this funding has been frozen. Do you think this is a part of a pattern
*18:00.160- 18:06.740* :  of putting tourism ahead of local people's rights in Tanzania? Well that's what some human rights
*18:06.740- 18:12.660* :  groups are saying because this is not the first time that there have been a controversy over plans
*18:12.660- 18:19.020* :  to expand a park. Some listeners might remember hearing about the mass eye community being forcefully
*18:19.020- 18:25.900* :  evicted from another park further north and again the government denied that it was carrying
*18:25.900- 18:31.460* :  out abuses and kicking people off that land but several human rights groups came out with
*18:32.020- 18:37.380* :  multiple reports including evidence from villagers who said they were the subject of abuse
*18:37.440- 18:43.680* :  and they were being forced off that land in order for the park to be expanded so that more tourism
*18:43.680- 18:52.800* :  money could come in. Our Africa Regional Editor Will Ross. Still to come in this podcast a popular

*20:18.300- 20:23.760* :  Now the USAID package we were talking about earlier in connection with Ukraine also included
*20:23.760- 20:30.360* :  26 billion dollars of military aid to Israel and one billion dollars in humanitarian assistance
*20:30.360- 20:35.740* :  for Gaza. On Wednesday, Israeli officials again confirmed they're moving ahead with plans for
*20:35.740- 20:41.300* :  a military assault on the southern Gaza City of Raffa despite the United States disapproval.
*20:41.740- 20:46.680* :  More than one million Palestinians are currently sheltering there. There are reports that Israel
*20:46.680- 20:51.860* :  has bought tents for civilians who will need to be moved when an offensive on Raffa takes place.
*20:52.400- 20:55.440* :  Here's the Israeli government spokesman David Mensa.
*20:55.860- 21:01.480* :  I've seen those reports and I won't be making any comment on on the numbers or whatever it is but
*21:01.480- 21:09.480* :  needless to say we have a quiet shelters for people because we don't want our battle is not
*21:09.480- 21:15.540* :  with ordinary guards and we want to move them out of harm's way our battle is with the genocidal
*21:15.540- 21:21.940* :  terrorist army of Hamas. Meanwhile the United States and the European Union have also added
*21:21.940- 21:27.800* :  their voice to that of the UN by demanding an investigation over reports of mass graves at the
*21:27.800- 21:33.860* :  NASA Medical Complex in Harniunis. Peter Stano is a spokesperson for the European Commission.
*21:34.460- 21:39.600* :  We are gravely concerned by the by the reported discovery of mass graves in Harniunis and in
*21:40.060- 21:45.380* :  Al-Shifa hospital. This is something that forces us to call for an independent investigation
*21:45.380- 21:52.780* :  of all the suspicions and all the circumstances because indeed it creates the impression that
*21:52.780- 21:57.460* :  there might have been violations of international human rights committed. That's why it's important
*21:57.460- 22:02.880* :  to have independent investigation. Israel has denied allegations by officials in Hamas
*22:02.880- 22:08.540* :  run southern Gaza that its forces buried the bodies of Palestinians under a hospital courtyard.
*22:09.260- 22:14.160* :  The Israel Defense Forces said it had opened existing graves while searching for the remains
*22:14.160- 22:19.820* :  of hostages. It described reports that they buried bodies as baseless and unfounded.
*22:21.140- 22:26.060* :  After more than six months of war the impact of the conflict on the economies of Israel and the
*22:26.060- 22:31.680* :  Palestinian territories has been significant while nearly all economic activity in Gaza has
*22:31.680- 22:37.580* :  been wiped out. The World Bank says the war has also badly hit businesses in the Palestinian
*22:37.580- 22:43.940* :  West Bank and as we're a Davis report Israel's much-vointered status as the start-up nation
*22:43.940- 22:53.080* :  is also under pressure. I'm in the old city of Jerusalem walking down the Via Doloros. At this
*22:53.080- 22:58.480* :  time of year there would be tens of thousands of tourists here pilgrims visiting the holy sites
*22:59.540- 23:06.840* :  but it's eerily quiet. A few of the tourist shops are opening but dozens of them have remained closed.
*23:08.200- 23:13.420* :  I'm Zach Mushrekki and I'm owner of a business inside the old city of Jerusalem. I sell mostly
*23:13.420- 23:19.860* :  antiquities and biblical coins. What is business like at the minute? Only online but physical people
*23:19.860- 23:26.060* :  know we don't have you know the last week you know after the Iran-Israel escalation just drop it
*23:26.480- 23:33.700* :  down again. The old city is in occupied East Jerusalem. Just 68,000 tourists arrived in the region
*23:33.700- 23:41.340* :  in February according to Israel's central Bureau of Statistics. That's down massively from 319,000
*23:41.340- 23:47.300* :  visitors in the same month last year but it's not just in Jerusalem's holy places that they need
*23:47.300- 23:53.720* :  a miracle. My name is Opholmaskowitz and I'm in charge of the this orchard of the Kibustinis
*23:53.720- 23:58.740* :  government. Around 150 miles north of Jerusalem on Israel's volatile border with Lebanon,
*23:58.820- 24:05.160* :  clashes with Hezbollah have closed much of the area. Agriculture like avocado farming is another
*24:05.160- 24:10.500* :  small but visible part of the economy that has been hit hard. 90 percent of them fell down.
*24:10.780- 24:16.080* :  The 90 percent of this crop of poultry has fallen down. Yes and you can see I must go to pick
*24:16.080- 24:21.920* :  their fruits and it's very important to the next season and I'm losing a lot of money because I can't
*24:24.500- 24:29.680* :  pick. In the coastal city of Tel Aviv you'd be forgiven for occasionally forgetting that Israel
*24:29.680- 24:35.820* :  is embroiled in its longest war since independence in 1948. Families make the most of the early
*24:35.820- 24:44.880* :  summer sun to play in the surf and young people relax near the beach. Last week the ratings agency
*24:44.880- 24:51.820* :  S&P Global cut Israel's long term forecast, reflecting a loss of market confidence after six months
*24:51.820- 24:58.020* :  of war. Many Israelis though say the countries renowned high tech and startup sectors are proving
*24:58.020- 25:03.180* :  to be more war proof than expected. In the first quarter of this year almost two billion dollars
*25:03.180- 25:09.700* :  was invested in Israeli startups. John Medved is founder and CEO of the Global Venture Investment
*25:09.700- 25:15.780* :  Platform R-Crowd. We're having one of the best years we've ever had and all of the big major
*25:15.780- 25:22.540* :  corporations are here and are going nowhere. Not a single multinational has closed its operation
*25:22.540- 25:28.140* :  in Israel since the war. Elis Brezes is a professor of economics at Barra Lan University
*25:28.140- 25:33.820* :  here in Tel Aviv. She says the full economic impact of the war may not yet have been felt.
*25:34.420- 25:42.600* :  Yes we have a reduction in exports but we had also a reduction in imports so in fact the
*25:42.600- 25:48.740* :  balance of payment is still okay. If the outlook in Israel is mixed then across the separation barrier
*25:48.740- 25:55.460* :  that divides Jerusalem from Bethlehem the view from the Palestinian side is overwhelmingly bleak.
*25:55.720- 26:02.780* :  This is the first chairman for our Chamber of Commerce in 1952. Dr. Sami Hasbun is chairman of
*26:02.780- 26:08.200* :  Bethlehem's Chamber of Commerce and Industry. There's huge dependence and reliance on Israel's
*26:08.200- 26:13.820* :  economy here and while Gaza's economy has been completely destroyed by the war here in the
*26:13.820- 26:19.580* :  landlocked Palestinian West Bank the almost complete closure of the separation barrier has had a
*26:19.580- 26:27.040* :  disastrous impact says Dr. Hasbun. Bethlehem governorate now it's closed there was around 16,000 to
*26:27.040- 26:33.360* :  20,000 Palestinian workers from our area working in Israel immediately they lost their income.
*26:33.360- 26:40.700* :  You can imagine the impact on the economy and in June I'm expecting around 30,000 new graduates
*26:40.700- 26:46.580* :  from the Palestinian universities what they will do. Unlike in some parts of Israel where there
*26:46.580- 26:52.080* :  is optimism around being able to ride out the storm and continue attracting investors in the
*26:52.080- 26:57.980* :  Palestinian West Bank and Gaza there's little hope things will return to any kind of normal.
*26:58.900- 27:04.520* :  We're a Davis reporting from Israel and the West Bank. Now let's hear from what some people
*27:04.520- 27:07.080* :  consider to be the world's bravest rapper.
*27:18.700- 27:24.460* :  Too much Salahee is an Iranian hip-hop star who dedicated a lot of his music to the nation-wide
*27:24.460- 27:31.500* :  protest launched in 2022 after the death of Masa Amani in police custody. He was arrested in
*27:31.500- 27:37.460* :  the same year but on Wednesday he was sentenced to death. I asked Byron Abati of BBC Persian TV
*27:37.460- 27:44.980* :  about the case. He faced a number of charges including corruption on earth. It's a vaguely
*27:44.980- 27:51.700* :  worded charge and the government usually uses it against its critics. It's based on Sharia law
*27:52.020- 27:59.720* :  and it carries the death penalty. He was sentenced to death but the Supreme Court rejected death
*27:59.720- 28:06.360* :  sentence. He was sentenced to 60 years and a half in prison was released on bail in October 2023.
*28:07.340- 28:12.860* :  Once he was released he released a video detailing his treatment in prison and he said that he was
*28:12.880- 28:18.000* :  tortured 11 days later he was arrested again and it seems that a lower court has reopened the
*28:18.000- 28:23.340* :  case and re-issued the death penalty saying that it is exercising its independence.
*28:24.220- 28:28.380* :  So is it possible that it will be overturned again by the Supreme Court and it won't actually
*28:28.380- 28:33.980* :  be carried out? There is a possibility his lawyer has said that they definitely plan to appeal.
*28:34.780- 28:39.920* :  And how are Iranians inside and outside of the country likely to react to this?
*28:40.460- 28:46.380* :  It has already come as a shock to his fans and many Iranians around the world because the death
*28:46.380- 28:52.780* :  penalty was rejected in the first place nobody expected it to be re-issued. BBC Persian TV
*28:52.780- 28:59.300* :  spoke to his uncle who lives in Germany. He was also very angry and very disappointed saying that
*28:59.720- 29:06.180* :  this is a warning by the Islamic Republic to the youth not to challenge his authority.
*29:06.800- 29:10.640* :  And he asked all Iranians around the world, especially the Iranian diaspora,
*29:11.160- 29:17.600* :  to take to this chase and to raise awareness about how the Iranian government is cheating its critics.
*29:18.640- 29:20.960* :  Byron Abassi of BBC Persian TV
*29:22.500- 29:26.680* :  To Portugal now where the country's president Marcelo Rebello de Solza
*29:26.680- 29:32.180* :  surprised some when he announced Portugal takes full responsibility for its role in transatlantic
*29:32.180- 29:38.520* :  slavery and suggested that there was a need for reparations to be paid. In an unexpected statement
*29:38.520- 29:43.200* :  the president said his country needed to repair the damage caused by its colonial past.
*29:43.200- 29:46.940* :  Historically Portugal had a long involvement in the slave trade,
*29:46.980- 29:52.760* :  transporting around 6 million Africans across the Atlantic between the 15th and 19th centuries.
*29:53.440- 29:59.460* :  The BBC's Celia hadn't asked Professor Pedro Cardim from Nova University in Lisbon for
*29:59.460- 30:04.840* :  reaction to the president's comments. I was surprised because I know that not long ago we
*30:04.840- 30:10.040* :  did not all this opinion. For instance, he emphasized that the Portuguese had been the first
*30:10.040- 30:16.960* :  Europeans to abolish the slave trade, which was actually even true. And preferred to underscore
*30:16.960- 30:22.580* :  this positive image of the Portuguese imperial past. There's also sectors of the left who
*30:22.580- 30:28.160* :  considered inappropriate to address these issues. And just to give an example, the former Portuguese
*30:28.160- 30:34.720* :  Prime Minister, a socialist, even stated that discussing the imperial past was threatening to
*30:34.720- 30:42.020* :  our identity. So a significant about face then. Can you just tell us what was Portugal's role
*30:42.020- 30:47.340* :  in transatlantic slavery? Portugal was opening up these new roots of trade
*30:48.020- 30:55.640* :  between southern Europe and many areas of South Africa. And later in the first decades of the
*30:55.640- 31:02.260* :  16th century Portugal expanded this trade to the Americas. It became the first nation to supply
*31:02.260- 31:10.260* :  Spanish empire with the labor force of thousands of enslaved Africans. And it remained the only
*31:10.260- 31:17.200* :  European nation deeply engaged in this trade until I would say the 1630s, 1640s. The time when
*31:17.200- 31:22.560* :  the Dutch and the French and the English and also other European nations got more involved.
*31:23.060- 31:28.460* :  Which means that the relationship that Portugal has with the transatlantic slave trade is
*31:28.460- 31:36.280* :  one of the pioneering, so to say. And it lasted for several centuries. It is actually the longest
*31:36.280- 31:42.220* :  involvement in the transatlantic slave trade among the various European nations holding these
*31:42.220- 31:49.080* :  terrible trades. Okay, so given this vast history, what kind of reparations could be made?
*31:49.520- 31:56.800* :  To begin with, I think reparation means apologizing just like other European leaders have done.
*31:57.280- 32:02.720* :  Apologizing is important, but what other things could be done? Are there any payments that could
*32:02.720- 32:07.640* :  be made? Are there objects that could be returned, for example? Yeah, objects. Studying the
*32:07.640- 32:12.700* :  provenance of colonial artifacts in Portuguese collections is, I think, absolutely necessary.
*32:13.400- 32:18.580* :  And also discussing the return of those that are proven to result from looting and other
*32:19.280- 32:26.560* :  more important objects. Also important is to seize, to use public funds to finance initiatives
*32:26.560- 32:32.180* :  that celebrate the so-called discoveries that you say this enduring positive image of the
*32:32.180- 32:38.140* :  Portuguese imperial past. And it's absolutely fundamental to promote the discourse about
*32:38.140- 32:43.180* :  imperial past that is more just, more frank and more plural. And above all, those who are at
*32:43.180- 32:47.160* :  the descendants of those who suffered most from Portuguese colonial domination.
*32:47.940- 32:54.760* :  Proversa Pedro Codim from Nova University in Lisbon. Nowadays, the prevalence of social media
*32:54.760- 32:59.680* :  in most people's lives would suggest that people are generally very keen to keep contact with
*32:59.680- 33:06.780* :  new acquaintances or seek out old friends. But new research suggests otherwise. James McCarthy
*33:06.780- 33:12.340* :  reconnected with his best friend from childhood by chance at a livable football match after being
*33:12.340- 33:18.480* :  out of touch for more than 50 years. I've had a season second for many years. And there's a stranger,
*33:18.480- 33:25.360* :  says the next to me. And he's quite quiet. He wrote about 68. I show him my social media.
*33:25.360- 33:31.380* :  And then he sees my surname. And he said, did you go to Cardinal and Grammar School in a livable
*33:31.380- 33:38.080* :  poll? I go, yeah. He says, James, it's me, Colin. And he was my best friend from school. When we got
*33:38.080- 33:43.540* :  to 16, nice, they don't foray levels. And a few weeks later, I get a letter from Colin from
*33:43.540- 33:50.100* :  London. He said, that moved down here. And he doesn't put his address on it. And that's how we
*33:50.100- 33:55.900* :  lost touch, can you believe? And we just feel we've got so much catching up to do. We have so much
*33:55.900- 34:02.600* :  in common. In fact, research from the University of Sussex in England found that people are just as
*34:02.600- 34:08.540* :  likely to speak to a stranger as James thought he was doing as they are to get back in touch with
*34:08.540- 34:13.760* :  an old friend, even when they want to see the friend and know they'd been happy to hear from them.
*34:13.760- 34:20.540* :  Dr. Gillian Sandstrom is the psychologist behind the research. We found over and over across
*34:20.540- 34:26.860* :  lots of different studies just how reluctant people are to reach out to an old friend. Because in
*34:26.860- 34:31.160* :  many ways, we seem to feel like we're better than average. We feel like we're better than average
*34:31.160- 34:36.800* :  drivers. We're more honest than other people, etc. But in terms of social skills, it seems to be an
*34:36.800- 34:41.660* :  exception. We seem to feel like we're not any good at those. We feel like we don't know how to
*34:41.660- 34:46.980* :  chat with people. We think people don't like us as much as we like them. And so, you know, in
*34:46.980- 34:51.560* :  terms of reaching out to people, we worry a lot that they won't want to hear from us, that it'll
*34:51.560- 34:56.880* :  feel awkward. And we might feel a bit guilty for losing touch with them. I mean, it does seem
*34:56.880- 35:01.500* :  extraordinary because some of these researchers show that sometimes people would be reluctant even
*35:01.500- 35:07.080* :  when they knew the person would be happy to hear from them. Exactly. Yeah. And so, we tried
*35:07.080- 35:12.900* :  lots of things to try to encourage people to reach out. We found that people want someone to
*35:12.900- 35:16.200* :  reach out to them. They just don't want to be the one to initiate. There's research showing
*35:16.200- 35:20.600* :  that people appreciate it more than you even expect. But still, we could only get about a third
*35:20.600- 35:26.080* :  of people to push them on a message that they'd already typed to someone that they thought would
*35:26.080- 35:31.360* :  appreciate it. They just still would not do it. That reluctance. Did you look at how you could
*35:31.360- 35:36.780* :  overcome the reluctance that people feel? So, I've done a lot of research on talking to strangers.
*35:36.780- 35:42.360* :  And of course, you know, a lot of us feel really kind of anxious about that. And I ran a study
*35:42.360- 35:47.100* :  involving a scavenger hunt where I asked people to talk to a stranger every day for a week.
*35:47.480- 35:51.780* :  And what I found is having that practice, the repeated practice really made a difference.
*35:52.220- 35:57.940* :  So, we adapted that to the reaching out situation. And we found that if people practice the behavior
*35:57.940- 36:02.040* :  that's involved in reaching out, which is just sending messages. So, if people send messages
