*01:12.020- 01:16.500* :  I'm Jackie Leonard, and in this edition uploaded on Saturday, April the 13th.
*01:16.740- 01:20.000* :  Every night, you can look up and see all the stars,
*01:20.060- 01:23.520* :  and if you keep looking, you see a shooting star.
*01:23.840- 01:29.040* :  We're here from a 105-year-old man who really appreciates the skies in general,
*01:29.500- 01:31.880* :  and a total solar eclipse, in particular.
*01:32.380- 01:36.000* :  Also, the phone app, helping people learn to read in the Horn of Africa.
*01:36.460- 01:38.160* :  Now I can completely live it.
*01:38.720- 01:40.060* :  I'm more ambitious now.
*01:40.140- 01:43.580* :  I feel I can do anything by myself.
*01:43.580- 01:47.480* :  South Africa welcomes a cheetah born in captivity in Australia.
*01:47.780- 01:50.100* :  They first walk into the bushes, along with walks that they've ever done.
*01:50.380- 01:51.720* :  They've never seen so much space.
*01:51.720- 01:54.180* :  They've never seen these beautiful, wild animals around them.
*01:54.460- 01:55.580* :  Also, in this podcast.
*01:56.240- 01:59.160* :  Cevres, cheque, yo, ganes, sort of, vlash, quimote.
*02:00.500- 02:01.180* :  Did you hear that?
*02:01.500- 02:03.100* :  Would you like me to speak vlashky now?
*02:03.840- 02:04.740* :  Yes, yes, we would.
*02:05.060- 02:06.860* :  All coming up here on The Happy Pod.
*02:12.040- 02:14.860* :  And we begin with a moment of celestial wonder.
*02:15.480- 02:17.340* :  You might have heard it mentioned that on Monday,
*02:17.340- 02:20.840* :  a total solar eclipse took place passing over Mexico
*02:20.840- 02:22.960* :  and a strip of the USA to Canada.
*02:23.380- 02:26.240* :  Darkness fell, birds, insects, and other creatures
*02:26.520- 02:27.420* :  wondered what was going on.
*02:28.060- 02:29.500* :  And humans gazed in awe.
*02:36.360- 02:37.380* :  I don't want it to end.
*02:39.120- 02:40.000* :  It was really good.
*02:40.200- 02:41.980* :  Actually cried a little tear to you a little
*02:41.980- 02:43.180* :  because it was like overwhelming.
*02:43.400- 02:44.240* :  It was pretty special.
*02:44.640- 02:45.440* :  We enjoyed it.
*02:45.840- 02:50.380* :  Among those watching was Leverne Biser from Fort Worth, in Texas.
*02:50.920- 02:55.460* :  He is 105 years old, and has seen no fewer than 13 solar
*02:55.460- 02:56.240* :  eclipses.
*02:56.680- 02:59.400* :  He's been speaking to the youngest member of our team,
*02:59.400- 03:00.800* :  Nabiha Ahmed.
*03:01.540- 03:05.280* :  Leverne, you're 105, turning 106 in June.
*03:05.760- 03:06.720* :  I'm 21.
*03:07.480- 03:10.260* :  So how would you describe to a 21-year-old?
*03:10.920- 03:12.120* :  Why eclipses are so special?
*03:12.120- 03:13.320* :  What makes them so special?
*03:13.860- 03:15.680* :  I've never seen one in my life, by the way.
*03:16.600- 03:20.320* :  Well, it's just something, it's a celestial exhibit
*03:20.320- 03:22.280* :  that happens not very often.
*03:22.720- 03:25.260* :  And if you don't travel the world, if you
*03:25.260- 03:27.740* :  won't see more than one in your lifetime,
*03:28.300- 03:31.760* :  but you, like me, take tours that travel the world,
*03:31.760- 03:33.160* :  you can see a bunch of them.
*03:33.880- 03:36.640* :  But kids, if you stay right here at home,
*03:36.640- 03:39.980* :  you'll never see another 300 years from now.
*03:39.980- 03:41.860* :  It'll be one more here at Fort Worth.
*03:42.380- 03:44.040* :  And how did it make you feel, Leverne,
*03:44.040- 03:46.500* :  to see this eclips, your 13th eclips?
*03:46.820- 03:48.080* :  Well, it felt good.
*03:48.540- 03:53.780* :  This was my 13th eclips, and it was called my Lucky 13,
*03:53.820- 03:57.160* :  because the cows were opening it up, and we saw it.
*03:57.160- 04:00.440* :  We were lucky to see it, because the weather prediction
*04:00.440- 04:02.480* :  showed it was going to be cloudy that day.
*04:02.480- 04:05.860* :  But it didn't, it opened it up, and we saw it.
*04:05.860- 04:07.760* :  So I called it my Lucky 13.
*04:09.520- 04:13.260* :  Tell us a little bit more about how your local stars began.
*04:14.380- 04:17.540* :  When you go out in the country like that where it's dark,
*04:17.540- 04:20.400* :  you can look up, you can see the North Star,
*04:20.400- 04:24.160* :  the Big Dipper, Orion, all constellations.
*04:24.940- 04:27.760* :  You see the plants, Mercury, Venus,
*04:28.340- 04:30.940* :  the Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
*04:31.380- 04:34.940* :  You keep track of all those stars as they travel around.
*04:35.600- 04:37.640* :  You can see the Milky Way all the time.
*04:37.660- 04:42.320* :  I hate to think that modern kids live in town
*04:42.680- 04:44.580* :  and never seen any stars.
*04:45.000- 04:47.240* :  They are about in that country and look up.
*04:47.740- 04:50.580* :  I'm really happy that eclipses make you so happy,
*04:51.120- 04:53.480* :  and this podcast that we're doing this interview for,
*04:54.080- 04:55.900* :  it's all about the things that make you happy.
*04:56.360- 04:58.380* :  And what tips, give us some tips, Leverne,
*04:58.380- 04:59.980* :  how do we live a long and happy life?
*05:00.620- 05:04.240* :  I live in a clean life, not a puff of cigarette,
*05:04.760- 05:09.340* :  not one sip of liquor, no drugs, whatever, good food,
*05:09.760- 05:10.860* :  lots of chocolate milk.
*05:13.160- 05:14.740* :  Wonder at the heavens and chocolate milk,
*05:14.740- 05:17.340* :  excellent advice from Leverne Biser.
*05:17.800- 05:20.060* :  And you will find some excellent eclips pictures
*05:20.300- 05:21.960* :  on the science pages of our website,
*05:22.480- 05:25.400* :  and we'll have more eclips-related news a little later.
*05:27.080- 05:29.320* :  Now, more from our occasional series,
*05:29.320- 05:32.220* :  celebrating communication and culture,
*05:32.720- 05:35.440* :  and the rare and unusual languages around the world.
*05:36.000- 05:38.220* :  This week, we're talking about Vlaski,
*05:38.680- 05:40.300* :  a critically endangered language
*05:40.300- 05:42.580* :  from the Austrian peninsula of Croatia.
*05:42.580- 05:44.620* :  It's also known as Istro-Romanian,
*05:44.620- 05:47.080* :  and it has just a few hundred speakers left.
*05:47.660- 05:48.660* :  So I was talking about Monica.
*05:49.700- 05:51.960* :  I was talking about the Russian language.
*05:53.220- 05:53.720* :  It's a tonic.
*05:54.760- 05:55.560* :  I was talking about the language,
*05:56.540- 05:59.840* :  and I was talking about the history of the language.
*06:02.780- 06:04.200* :  That's a taste of Vlaski.
*06:04.280- 06:05.540* :  I am reliably informed.
*06:05.540- 06:07.760* :  He's talking about learning to play the accordion.
*06:08.260- 06:10.520* :  Now, we were first made aware of the language
*06:10.520- 06:12.280* :  when a listener in New York,
*06:12.760- 06:14.960* :  Roberta Bolulavic, emailed in,
*06:14.960- 06:18.900* :  and took a reporter Harry Blyh on a journey of discovery.
*06:19.500- 06:20.780* :  What was your reaction when you heard
*06:20.780- 06:24.000* :  we were looking for rare and endangered languages?
*06:25.280- 06:27.860* :  I immediately said, I have to send them an email.
*06:28.500- 06:31.240* :  It was amazing, just amazing.
*06:31.700- 06:34.300* :  Roberta Bolulavic grew up hearing her father
*06:34.300- 06:38.080* :  speak the language of Istro-Romanian or Vlaski.
*06:38.640- 06:41.000* :  Born on Croatia's Istro-Romanian peninsula,
*06:41.400- 06:43.480* :  he moved to the United States as a child.
*06:44.060- 06:46.500* :  We used to speak several different languages
*06:46.980- 06:48.520* :  in the family when the family got together,
*06:48.520- 06:50.200* :  but whenever they spoke,
*06:50.560- 06:52.840* :  strictly to each other, they always spoke in Vlaski,
*06:53.000- 06:54.160* :  and I always wanted to learn it,
*06:54.160- 06:57.620* :  but dad said, well, we didn't speak it to,
*06:58.720- 06:59.400* :  and to truth be wise,
*06:59.400- 07:01.460* :  there really was nobody but him and my grandmother
*07:01.460- 07:02.140* :  to speak it to.
*07:02.560- 07:05.360* :  But Roberta has always maintained a fascination
*07:05.800- 07:06.540* :  with this language,
*07:06.540- 07:10.080* :  and has been back to Croatia to visit her ancestral home.
*07:10.360- 07:14.260* :  I did go to his home village of Susniewica several times,
*07:14.880- 07:16.140* :  and I got to know his cousins.
*07:17.080- 07:20.720* :  And two of his cousins, especially one named Frane,
*07:20.980- 07:22.460* :  Belyulavic, same last name,
*07:22.940- 07:26.040* :  was a real proponent of the Vlaski language.
*07:26.380- 07:30.280* :  There are actually two websites that are devoted
*07:30.620- 07:34.340* :  to the Eastern language, both Miro and Frane,
*07:34.680- 07:36.140* :  are on those websites.
*07:37.460- 07:41.220* :  They were interviewed, and Miro is on one,
*07:41.280- 07:43.760* :  and Frane is on the other one, so it's great.
*07:43.760- 07:45.000* :  I love to hear their voices,
*07:45.000- 07:46.400* :  even though I don't know what they're saying.
*07:56.540- 07:59.580* :  This is the voice of Roberta's second cousin, Frane,
*08:00.060- 08:03.080* :  singing in Vlaski, as provided by the preservation
*08:03.080- 08:05.900* :  of Vlaski and Sajanski language group.
*08:06.980- 08:09.660* :  And as Roberta mentions, there's a second project,
*08:10.100- 08:13.180* :  the Istro-Romanian language at Oxford University,
*08:13.180- 08:14.660* :  or Istrox.
*08:15.300- 08:18.280* :  This group has worked with remaining Vlaski speakers
*08:18.740- 08:21.440* :  and specialist linguists to explore the history
*08:21.840- 08:23.260* :  and help keep the language alive.
*08:24.080- 08:27.140* :  And author's remaining speakers are some of Roberta's
*08:27.280- 08:28.220* :  surviving family.
*08:28.460- 08:32.620* :  We have in the family one current native speaker
*08:33.160- 08:34.920* :  of Vlaski left in New York.
*08:35.440- 08:38.060* :  She was very young when she came here, just like my dad,
*08:38.060- 08:39.920* :  but she was a lot younger than him.
*08:40.480- 08:43.600* :  And she could actually speak the language
*08:43.600- 08:45.420* :  if you wanted to hear it.
*08:45.520- 08:47.340* :  Her name is Celestina Belolović,
*08:47.660- 08:51.040* :  and so she, I know, would be really interested
*08:51.040- 08:52.000* :  in speaking with you.
*08:52.540- 09:01.940* :  Celestina Belolović still speaks Vlaski daily,
*09:01.940- 09:05.380* :  and considers it a crucial part of her identity.
*09:06.100- 09:08.820* :  She moved to the US in the 1950s
*09:08.820- 09:11.460* :  after being displaced in the Second World War.
*09:11.720- 09:14.380* :  Celestina now lives in the state of New Jersey
*09:14.680- 09:17.280* :  and spoke to us alongside her daughter, Sonya.
*09:17.340- 09:19.940* :  He's asking you how important the language is to you.
*09:20.400- 09:21.760* :  Oh, very important.
*09:22.700- 09:23.640* :  We love to talk.
*09:23.640- 09:27.040* :  I have five or six friends that we always talk only Vlaski.
*09:27.420- 09:30.520* :  C'est vrai que yoga n'est sort of Vlaski mocha.
*09:31.720- 09:32.440* :  Did you hear that?
*09:32.740- 09:34.360* :  Would you like me to speak Vlaski now?
*09:34.880- 09:38.200* :  And perhaps one of the best Vlaski phrases we learnt
*09:38.840- 09:40.740* :  was one that Celestina and her family
*09:41.180- 09:42.740* :  had to come up with themselves.
*09:43.160- 09:46.480* :  You know, we don't know how to Vlaski say happy birthday.
*09:47.880- 09:49.660* :  There's no translation for happy birthday.
*09:49.860- 09:51.700* :  So tell me what you said for happy birthday.
*09:51.700- 09:53.200* :  What do you say when you say happy birthday?
*09:53.200- 09:55.980* :  Oh, we said chézé, chézé, no indeed.
*09:56.360- 09:57.840* :  So, and what is that translated to?
*09:57.840- 09:59.320* :  The day you were born.
*09:59.320- 10:01.540* :  On the day you were born instead of saying happy birthday.
*10:01.740- 10:03.880* :  Oh, I think yeah, then we tried to figure it out.
*10:03.880- 10:05.200* :  There's no happy birthday.
*10:07.380- 10:08.100* :  I love that.
*10:08.380- 10:10.060* :  So you decided that the day you were born,
*10:12.020- 10:14.420* :  it's lovely to have heard some Vlaski
*10:14.620- 10:16.500* :  from a Vlaski speaker.
*10:18.220- 10:20.020* :  See that, Nana, you're a celebrity.
*10:21.540- 10:23.580* :  I can't wait to go back all the time.
*10:23.580- 10:24.940* :  I love the country.
*10:24.940- 10:28.220* :  I love all the way of Rano Patia,
*10:28.220- 10:30.240* :  Deca, Trieste.
*10:30.760- 10:31.900* :  Not far from home.
*10:33.700- 10:36.780* :  Celestina Bolulovic, our thanks to her and her daughter
*10:36.780- 10:39.420* :  and to Roberta Bolulovic who emailed in.
*10:39.820- 10:41.900* :  If you'd like to tell us about your own language too,
*10:41.900- 10:43.420* :  we would love to hear from you.
*10:43.460- 10:44.320* :  You know where we are.
*10:44.320- 10:48.160* :  We are global podcast at VBC.co.uk.
*10:49.460- 10:51.960* :  A cheetah born in an Australian zoo
*10:51.980- 10:55.040* :  has made a journey back to the wilds of South Africa.
*10:55.620- 10:56.940* :  The cheetah, known as ED,
*10:57.360- 10:59.440* :  is the first of her kind to make the trip
*10:59.860- 11:01.700* :  and those who have helped her along the way
*11:02.000- 11:04.500* :  hope that others will soon follow in her footsteps.
*11:05.200- 11:05.660* :  Poor Prince.
*11:06.420- 11:07.580* :  Footsteps, you know what I mean?
*11:07.880- 11:10.340* :  Our reporter Terry Egan spoke to Derek Milburn
*11:10.340- 11:13.240* :  and Victoria West from WeWild Africa.
*11:14.180- 11:15.560* :  Eddie is a petty young cat.
*11:15.600- 11:17.900* :  She's about just short of two years old now
*11:18.040- 11:19.420* :  and she's a beautiful cat,
*11:19.420- 11:22.300* :  one of the most beautiful cat I've seen in a very long time.
*11:22.560- 11:24.680* :  Sometimes we get cheetahs that just haven't got that person
*11:25.040- 11:26.420* :  to see in the character and the confidence
*11:26.420- 11:29.020* :  where she's very confident she wants to go out.
*11:29.280- 11:30.320* :  I've got a very strong feeling
*11:30.320- 11:32.700* :  she's going to be a very successful release candidate
*11:33.340- 11:35.120* :  and today she's really impressed us.
*11:35.380- 11:38.460* :  So Eddie is at Ziki Private Gamery Reserve
*11:38.460- 11:41.020* :  located in the Northwest Province of South Africa.
*11:41.240- 11:42.040* :  It's got a beautiful,
*11:42.040- 11:44.580* :  so then I have a tattoo with lots of water, rivers.
*11:45.380- 11:46.200* :  As you implied there,
*11:46.220- 11:48.080* :  she's never before been in the wild.
*11:48.080- 11:51.660* :  So how do you think that she might be able to adapt
*11:51.660- 11:52.880* :  to that change?
*11:53.520- 11:54.640* :  It'll be quite different, right?
*11:54.700- 11:56.780* :  Because she's going to be living now
*11:56.800- 11:58.340* :  in the wild and hunting for herself.
*11:58.340- 12:00.200* :  But at the end of the day,
*12:00.260- 12:01.680* :  they have always been wild animals.
*12:01.840- 12:04.980* :  So I think that they actually will adapt to very well,
*12:04.980- 12:07.580* :  that their natural instincts will kick back in
*12:07.660- 12:09.120* :  and we've done this many times.
*12:09.180- 12:12.120* :  We've rescued and rewilded over 1,000 animals
*12:12.280- 12:13.180* :  in the last few years
*12:13.720- 12:15.540* :  and it's remarkable success
*12:15.540- 12:17.020* :  with rewilding captive animals.
*12:17.380- 12:19.120* :  Tell us more about this process
*12:19.120- 12:20.800* :  and the journey Eddie has been on.
*12:21.280- 12:23.580* :  So the process starts obviously in Australia
*12:23.580- 12:25.460* :  where we try and get it to change our diet
*12:25.460- 12:27.120* :  because many of the captive facilities
*12:27.120- 12:29.320* :  use like menstrual stress meat
*12:29.320- 12:30.940* :  or menstrual meat to feed the cheaters.
*12:31.540- 12:33.040* :  So the big thing is to try and change the diet
*12:33.040- 12:35.440* :  as much as we can when they're at their source destination.
*12:35.780- 12:38.520* :  We then have to go through a very lengthy process
*12:38.520- 12:41.640* :  of doing paper work to get the animals across to Africa
*12:42.240- 12:44.740* :  and we then book commercial flights
*12:44.740- 12:47.100* :  that these animals normally fly on commercial flights
*12:47.680- 12:48.600* :  and they travel really well.
*12:48.860- 12:49.460* :  And most of the time,
*12:49.460- 12:52.180* :  we don't even need to give them any sort of tranquilizer.
*12:52.180- 12:53.600* :  They're quite relaxed and travel.
*12:54.520- 12:56.820* :  And what is the long term aim of all this?
*12:57.520- 12:58.800* :  The long term aim of all of this
*12:58.940- 13:01.420* :  is really ensure that we have a sustainable Cheetah population
*13:01.460- 13:02.300* :  moving forward.
*13:02.300- 13:05.440* :  Cheetahs have been persecuted for many, many, many years
*13:06.020- 13:06.800* :  and at the end of the day,
*13:06.800- 13:08.340* :  we want to repopulate the rest of Africa,
*13:08.340- 13:10.700* :  the Cheetah population into Africa is very healthy
*13:11.420- 13:12.980* :  and we want to start moving cheaters
*13:13.000- 13:14.400* :  to other countries across Africa
*13:14.400- 13:17.120* :  and to repopulate those populations.
*13:18.100- 13:21.240* :  Victoria, how difficult is it to say goodbye to these cheaters
*13:21.620- 13:23.320* :  they having been brought up in Australia?
*13:24.240- 13:26.960* :  I think in general, when you're translocating
*13:26.960- 13:28.460* :  and working with animals,
*13:28.460- 13:30.660* :  it's always an emotional experience.
*13:30.840- 13:33.020* :  It's beautiful to see the animals
*13:33.140- 13:34.860* :  but at the end of the day,
*13:34.920- 13:36.400* :  they need to live in the wild
*13:36.560- 13:38.520* :  and I think it's even more beautiful
*13:38.520- 13:41.960* :  to see them going out into the wild and roaming free.
*13:42.680- 13:44.460* :  Any of the time they first walk into the bushes
*13:44.460- 13:45.880* :  along this walk, they've ever done it.
*13:45.920- 13:47.220* :  They've never seen so much space.
*13:47.220- 13:49.680* :  They've never seen these beautiful wild animals around them.
*13:50.080- 13:51.740* :  So sometimes it's quite daunting for there.
*13:51.880- 13:53.760* :  New smiles, new bird sounds.
*13:54.380- 13:55.240* :  So it's quite amazing.
*13:55.420- 13:57.280* :  But within a few weeks, they're completely normal
*13:57.280- 13:59.060* :  and they've been there for their whole lives.
*13:59.160- 14:00.960* :  So they're dept extremely well
*14:01.100- 14:02.660* :  and it's to be very proud of many of the cheaters
*14:02.660- 14:03.360* :  that we've worked with.
*14:03.960- 14:05.940* :  Derek Milburn and Victoria West,
*14:06.120- 14:06.900* :  good luck, Edie.
*14:07.840- 14:10.600* :  Now, could we be a step closer to helping people
*14:10.600- 14:13.340* :  with damaged vocal cords speak again?
*14:13.540- 14:15.160* :  Well, researchers in California
*14:15.160- 14:17.120* :  have built a small adhesive patch
*14:17.120- 14:20.680* :  that turns muscle movements into electrical signals
*14:21.200- 14:23.040* :  and the signals are then read out
*14:23.040- 14:24.740* :  using artificial intelligence.
*14:25.260- 14:27.220* :  It is still at a very early stage
*14:27.220- 14:29.620* :  but it looks positive as Isabelle a Jewel
*14:29.620- 14:30.560* :  has been finding out.
*14:31.080- 14:32.280* :  Here's what it sounds like.
*14:32.800- 14:33.500* :  Merry Christmas.
*14:34.620- 14:35.300* :  Merry Christmas.
*14:35.680- 14:38.720* :  The adhesive patch generates electricity from movement
*14:38.720- 14:40.480* :  so it doesn't need a battery.
*14:41.180- 14:44.600* :  The work on this new technology is very much in its infancy
*14:45.200- 14:47.520* :  but lead researcher, Dr. June Chen
*14:47.520- 14:49.720* :  from the University of California
*14:50.160- 14:53.280* :  says the patch could be working in just a few years
*14:54.100- 14:55.400* :  and at a low cost.
*14:55.640- 14:58.780* :  Those materials actually are very economically available.
*14:58.780- 15:02.720* :  So the device itself is not a very large
*15:02.720- 15:04.940* :  just a small tiny patch.
*15:05.120- 15:06.660* :  Oh, it's about 2.5 centimeters
*15:06.660- 15:08.880* :  by 2.5 centimeters from size.
*15:09.500- 15:11.880* :  So basically, roughly estimation,
*15:12.480- 15:15.000* :  the materials cost of this type of devices
*15:15.000- 15:18.040* :  is only about two to three US dollars.
*15:18.420- 15:20.240* :  Once the patch is stuck onto the patient,
*15:20.240- 15:22.540* :  it registers the movement of the larynx muscles
*15:22.540- 15:24.360* :  as opposed to the vocal cords,
*15:24.940- 15:27.520* :  meaning that people with damaged or no vocal cords
*15:27.520- 15:28.740* :  can use the technology.
*15:29.920- 15:31.800* :  So far, it has only been used to say
*15:31.800- 15:33.240* :  pre-recorded phrases
*15:33.780- 15:35.900* :  and tested on just a handful of people.
*15:36.840- 15:39.300* :  Martin Birchell, Professor of larynxology
*15:39.300- 15:40.940* :  at University College London,
*15:41.220- 15:42.620* :  wasn't involved in the research
*15:42.620- 15:44.120* :  but is watching closely.
*15:44.740- 15:47.020* :  He says it's a significant step forwards.
*15:47.660- 15:50.460* :  They're addressing a really big on met need
*15:51.060- 15:55.820* :  and progress in the field of really valid voice restoration
*15:55.940- 15:57.240* :  has been relatively slow.
*15:57.860- 15:58.980* :  It's certainly slow to get through
*15:58.980- 16:00.200* :  to the people who really need it
*16:00.520- 16:01.940* :  which is a very large population,
*16:01.940- 16:03.060* :  very, very population.
*16:03.560- 16:06.780* :  So I think it does show that you can actually generate
*16:07.580- 16:09.240* :  high quality voice using something
*16:09.240- 16:11.800* :  that's really completely non-invasive
*16:12.120- 16:14.160* :  and very well tolerated.
*16:14.240- 16:15.440* :  So I was excited to see it.
*16:15.740- 16:18.260* :  And it's the use of artificial intelligence
*16:18.260- 16:20.680* :  that has transformed research in the field.
*16:21.300- 16:23.300* :  People who know they're going to lose their voices
*16:23.300- 16:24.460* :  for one reason or another
*16:24.460- 16:26.780* :  are now able to bank their voices.
*16:27.420- 16:29.840* :  The banking of the voice entails
*16:29.860- 16:33.700* :  storing a large sample of them speaking normally.
*16:34.200- 16:35.940* :  And then this information can then be fed
*16:35.940- 16:37.140* :  into machine learning systems
*16:37.780- 16:41.180* :  to allow them to produce artificial
*16:41.180- 16:43.460* :  reconstructed ways their original voices
*16:43.800- 16:44.540* :  before they lost it.
*16:44.840- 16:45.800* :  It's massive.
*16:46.480- 16:49.900* :  Professor Martin Birchell on the research of Dr. Jun Chen.
*16:55.180- 16:55.940* :  Still to come.
*16:56.320- 16:59.560* :  Viral cookie from Paris made its way to Singapore.
*17:00.060- 17:01.240* :  Is finally in Geneva.
*17:01.460- 17:02.700* :  Just landed and answered him.
*17:02.820- 17:04.040* :  The spaker in Toronto had them.
*17:04.040- 17:05.100* :  I had to try them.
*17:05.100- 17:06.120* :  It's finally in London.
*17:06.780- 17:07.260* :  Hungry yet?
*17:07.660- 17:08.820* :  Introducing The Crookie.
*17:19.440- 17:20.080* :  Hey, everyone.
*17:20.080- 17:23.660* :  I'm Craig Robinson, co-host of The Ways to Win Podcast.
*17:24.280- 17:26.620* :  Alongside my good friend, John Calapari.
*17:26.900- 17:28.280* :  I've been on the go recently.
*17:28.580- 17:30.720* :  Phoenix, Kansas City, Chicago.
*17:31.380- 17:33.020* :  If you're like me and have a home
*17:33.020- 17:36.340* :  but aren't always at home, you have an Airbnb.
*17:36.900- 17:38.960* :  Posting your home or a spare room
*17:38.960- 17:41.260* :  is a very practical side hustle.
*17:41.480- 17:43.120* :  If you live in a big game town,
*17:43.120- 17:46.340* :  you can Airbnb your place for fans to stay in.
*17:46.600- 17:48.680* :  Your home might be worth more than you think.
*17:49.220- 17:53.340* :  Find out how much at Airbnb.com slash post.
*17:55.640- 17:57.600* :  The Global Jigsaw is the podcast looking
*17:57.600- 17:59.780* :  at the world through the lens of its media.
*18:00.020- 18:02.700* :  State media now which topics they can and can't discuss.
*18:03.100- 18:04.840* :  We fill gaps and connect dots
*18:04.900- 18:07.400* :  to better understand what's happening in the world.
*18:07.680- 18:09.320* :  It's important to remember the context.
*18:09.700- 18:13.000* :  An untangled and narratives aimed at influencing your views.
*18:13.420- 18:14.440* :  Tightly controlled.
*18:14.440- 18:17.100* :  It's not so healthy to be a journalist there.
*18:17.180- 18:20.000* :  The Global Jigsaw from the BBC World Service.
*18:20.580- 18:22.900* :  Listen now by searching for the explanation
*18:22.960- 18:25.020* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:31.180- 18:33.700* :  Now some of the other things that caught our eye this week.
*18:33.700- 18:40.640* :  That was the sound as Russ Cook crossed his finish line
*18:40.640- 18:43.140* :  at Africa's most northerly point earlier this week.
*18:43.140- 18:47.120* :  It marked the end of a grueling 352 day challenge
*18:47.560- 18:49.120* :  which saw him become the first person
*18:49.120- 18:50.700* :  to run the full length of Africa.
*18:51.160- 18:53.740* :  A journey of more than 16,000 kilometres.
*18:54.140- 18:55.000* :  Bravo to him.
*18:55.000- 18:57.520* :  Also this week three men have been rescued
*18:57.520- 18:59.640* :  from a tiny Micronesian island
*18:59.640- 19:03.640* :  after they spelled out help using palm leaves along the beach.
*19:03.940- 19:04.940* :  They were missing for nine days
*19:04.940- 19:06.900* :  before the US Coast Guard spotted them.
*19:07.360- 19:08.720* :  And how's this for a winning streak?
*19:08.720- 19:10.880* :  Italian, Jockey, Frankie, Datory,
*19:11.220- 19:14.620* :  won six consecutive races at the Santa Anita races
*19:14.620- 19:15.760* :  in California,
*19:16.220- 19:20.940* :  victories with cumulative odds of 77,000 to one.
*19:21.660- 19:22.560* :  And credit where it's due,
*19:22.560- 19:24.520* :  the horses were called Bull Don't Lie,
*19:24.520- 19:26.660* :  Ritinto Rompere, Roberta's Love,
*19:26.660- 19:29.560* :  Catherine Marisa, nothing like you, and Royal Charter.
*19:29.820- 19:31.140* :  Well, they were the ones doing the running.
*19:31.840- 19:34.820* :  Now, a brilliant solution to an intractable problem.
*19:34.920- 19:36.980* :  A phone app called Dares
*19:37.380- 19:39.040* :  that's helping people in the Horn of Africa
*19:39.040- 19:40.200* :  learn to read and write.
*19:40.700- 19:44.000* :  It's enabled half a million learners in Somali land so far,
*19:44.280- 19:46.080* :  almost half of them women and girls.
*19:46.560- 19:48.880* :  The founder of the app is British Somali
*19:48.880- 19:50.400* :  businessman Ismail Ahmed.
*19:51.040- 19:52.220* :  And he spoke to Claire Bates.
*19:59.420- 20:01.940* :  The first stage is about the alphabet basics.
*20:02.540- 20:04.940* :  And then the second stage takes you
*20:04.940- 20:08.400* :  says to read the basic stories.
*20:09.320- 20:12.200* :  And the third stage is a digital library
*20:12.520- 20:14.120* :  to read longer stories.
*20:14.900- 20:17.360* :  We first saw a reading meter
*20:17.940- 20:23.320* :  which forces uses to speedy up the reading.
*20:23.520- 20:25.400* :  And that is the one which really helps them
*20:25.400- 20:28.560* :  to achieve six to five minutes.
*20:29.180- 20:29.840* :  Shem Bill.
*20:31.000- 20:31.280* :  Rah.
*20:32.600- 20:32.980* :  Sa.
*20:34.140- 20:34.460* :  Damir.
*20:37.160- 20:40.100* :  The challenge we face in the Horn of Africa
*20:40.100- 20:44.760* :  is that the literacy level is one of the lowest
*20:44.820- 20:45.520* :  in the world.
*20:45.960- 20:47.720* :  We have a highly mobile population
*20:47.800- 20:51.160* :  and absolute school is rural areas.
*20:51.640- 20:53.260* :  So the foundation put me in touch
*20:53.260- 20:55.840* :  with some female market traders in Hageza,
*20:56.200- 20:57.500* :  the capital of Somali land.
*21:00.660- 21:02.840* :  And they've been given phones pre-loaded with the app
*21:02.840- 21:05.200* :  to see how easy or hard they found using it.
*21:05.280- 21:07.880* :  One of the women's Samir told me about her experience.
*21:11.260- 21:12.620* :  I didn't get the chance to study.
*21:12.940- 21:15.040* :  I'm from a generation where it was believed that
*21:15.480- 21:18.140* :  young girls should stay at home and do house chores.
*21:19.380- 21:21.160* :  I had about there up a few months ago.
*21:21.960- 21:24.660* :  I had that it helps women, especially mothers,
*21:25.340- 21:26.700* :  learn how to read and write.
*21:29.120- 21:31.660* :  I have just finished learning how to construct synthesis
*21:31.660- 21:33.560* :  and now I can completely read.
*21:34.700- 21:36.040* :  I'm more ambitious now.
*21:36.720- 21:39.580* :  I feel I can do anything by myself.
*21:40.360- 21:43.400* :  Whenever I go, I can read and understand the billboards
*21:43.740- 21:45.580* :  and signs around me by myself.
*21:47.580- 21:49.820* :  I also spoke to Keen, a mother and grandmother
*21:50.300- 21:51.460* :  who runs a fruit and vegetable.
*21:52.180- 21:54.960* :  She told me she missed out on schooling due to the Civil War.
*21:55.660- 21:56.660* :  Where is the meaning?
*21:57.500- 21:59.320* :  I've been using the app for six months.
*21:59.860- 22:02.500* :  Now I'm on level two, which means I can read
*22:02.500- 22:04.280* :  and write messages on my phone.
*22:06.300- 22:09.240* :  Keen said she now enjoys reading lots of stories on the app.
*22:09.800- 22:11.200* :  I will read out the good news.
*22:11.920- 22:14.340* :  The last one was about a woman called Doug Deer,
*22:14.780- 22:17.200* :  a woman with long ears who eats other people.
*22:17.940- 22:20.960* :  It's a Somali folk story often told by parents
*22:21.020- 22:22.180* :  to warn their children.
*22:23.040- 22:26.200* :  Since learning with Darius, I feel I'm out of the darkness
*22:26.200- 22:27.180* :  and into the light.
*22:28.000- 22:28.980* :  Education is light.
*22:29.620- 22:30.820* :  So I feel very happy.
*22:32.160- 22:34.360* :  The words of Keen satisfy Darius user
*22:34.640- 22:36.500* :  ending that report by Claire Bates.
*22:37.260- 22:39.440* :  Now it might not entirely surprise you
*22:39.440- 22:42.820* :  that the happy pod team is very keen indeed on baked goods.
*22:43.320- 22:46.740* :  So when we heard about a new pastry taking Paris by storm,
*22:46.860- 22:48.660* :  we knew we wanted in.
*22:49.120- 22:51.160* :  Now you might already have heard of the cronat
*22:51.200- 22:52.380* :  or the cruffin by now.
*22:52.380- 22:55.500* :  That's a mix of Quasson with a donut or a muffin, obviously.
*22:56.280- 22:59.000* :  But now a new hybrid is overshadowing them both
*22:59.000- 23:02.980* :  with cues around a block at Bellangerie Lovar in Paris
*23:03.520- 23:05.080* :  when they launched La Crookie,
*23:05.200- 23:09.240* :  a crispy Quasson filled with American-style cookie dough.
*23:09.800- 23:12.220* :  The novelty item soon spread around Europe.
*23:12.720- 23:16.140* :  And in London, Philippe Contachini made famous
*23:16.140- 23:18.920* :  for their extra, extra large Quasson
*23:19.220- 23:20.640* :  crafted their own version.
*23:21.200- 23:24.960* :  Stephanie Prentice took on the grueling task of investigating.
*23:25.780- 23:27.500* :  It's a question that's kept many
*23:27.500- 23:29.500* :  a master baker up at night.
*23:30.120- 23:33.540* :  What would happen if a cookie and a Quasson became one?
*23:34.680- 23:39.100* :  In France, a Boulangerie nation, pastry innovators got to work.
*23:39.500- 23:41.700* :  And TikTok responded to their creation,
*23:41.700- 23:44.960* :  La Crookie, as the idea went global.
*23:45.560- 23:48.520* :  Everyone is going crazy over the croissant cookie dough hybrid.
*23:48.600- 23:50.780* :  La croissant cookie, c'est ce qu'on va trajetester ensemble.
*23:51.100- 23:54.360* :  The viral cookie from Paris made its way to Singapore.
*23:54.840- 23:56.040* :  Is finally in Geneva.
*23:56.180- 23:57.520* :  Just landed and answered him.
*23:57.640- 23:59.900* :  The bakery in Toronto had them a hat to try them.
*24:00.020- 24:02.340* :  The viral cookie croissant is finally in London.
*24:03.860- 24:06.000* :  Philippe Contachini in North London
*24:06.000- 24:08.340* :  is one place that joined in the trend.
*24:08.540- 24:10.240* :  We've got a lot of people asking this.
*24:10.700- 24:11.760* :  What is the TikTok croissant?
*24:12.280- 24:15.180* :  pastry chef, she wrote letters behind the scenes.
*24:16.500- 24:19.300* :  The first thing we make the croissant dough one day before.
*24:20.000- 24:21.520* :  And then you cook croissant.
*24:22.220- 24:23.380* :  And then you take out.
*24:24.060- 24:27.820* :  Then you cut your croissant, put your cookies
*24:27.820- 24:30.300* :  to the inside, then on the top, and then you bake.
*24:30.500- 24:32.920* :  So did you have a few that went wrong when you first started?
*24:33.460- 24:34.340* :  Yeah, yeah.
*24:34.900- 24:39.460* :  We tried so many times, so many mistakes, so many, so many things.
*24:40.100- 24:42.820* :  We know TikTok loves them, but here at the Happy Podcast
*24:42.820- 24:45.000* :  we are true investigative journalists.
*24:45.000- 24:47.040* :  So testing was required.
*24:48.200- 24:51.100* :  Across the city to the west is South Kensington,
*24:51.100- 24:53.760* :  known as the France of London and home
*24:53.760- 24:56.560* :  to a high concentration of binangeries.
*24:56.980- 24:59.820* :  It is a cookie squashed onto a croissant,
*24:59.900- 25:01.800* :  but the croissant is still risen.
*25:02.080- 25:03.300* :  So it looks like a standard croissant.
*25:03.300- 25:04.280* :  It looks lovely, actually.
*25:04.560- 25:06.240* :  Michael from Cape Town lives there,
*25:06.240- 25:08.060* :  eats in the bakeries every day,
*25:08.400- 25:11.160* :  and identifies as a sweet treat expert.
*25:11.660- 25:14.120* :  So I have gone for the large croissants,
*25:14.180- 25:15.600* :  because that's what the place is known for.
*25:16.260- 25:18.400* :  Added to that, I've added just a baseline cookie
*25:18.400- 25:20.580* :  so I can do a little cookie test.
*25:21.140- 25:23.320* :  And then I've got the cookie on the left here.
*25:23.520- 25:26.300* :  So after doing the large croissant, a taste of the cookie,
*25:26.780- 25:31.020* :  and then the cookie, I will have the right ingredients
*25:31.020- 25:33.520* :  to give you the correct answer, if it's good or not.
*25:34.500- 25:35.380* :  All right, excuse me, let's go.
*25:36.500- 25:36.920* :  Mm.
*25:40.780- 25:41.320* :  It's so dry.
*25:41.860- 25:42.280* :  I need coffee.
*25:44.420- 25:44.800* :  No, no.
*25:45.840- 25:47.540* :  Okay, initial reports seem to indicate that
*25:47.540- 25:49.680* :  even with the cookie on top, the croissant is dry.
*25:51.560- 25:53.160* :  It's going to be some people's thing.
*25:53.320- 25:53.960* :  It's not mine.
*25:54.480- 25:55.500* :  I'm probably a traditionalist.
*25:55.560- 25:57.160* :  I like a cookie on croissants slightly separately.
*25:57.920- 26:00.020* :  Some people might like the innovation,
*26:00.680- 26:03.840* :  but I think it's a little bit too much for myself.
*26:04.380- 26:08.080* :  The crookie is priced at almost six pounds or seven dollars
*26:08.080- 26:11.740* :  in 50 cents, something TikTok and Michael questioned.
*26:12.220- 26:13.300* :  It's quite on the top end.
*26:13.340- 26:15.140* :  It must be honest on the cookies that I would have around
*26:15.140- 26:15.660* :  this area.
*26:16.140- 26:17.520* :  Would I come back for the crookie alone?
*26:17.520- 26:18.620* :  No, it's the answer.
*26:19.260- 26:22.400* :  So is the crookie a pricey novelty item
*26:22.400- 26:24.760* :  or an innovation that's here to stay?
*26:25.160- 26:27.500* :  For Chef Shiro, at least it's something
*26:27.500- 26:29.180* :  that just makes people happy.
*26:29.480- 26:31.940* :  It's good, you feel very, very nice inside
*26:31.940- 26:34.500* :  and it's a very nice feeling, yeah.
*26:34.920- 26:37.260* :  The people they love you, you know,
*26:37.260- 26:39.540* :  you work very hard for this one, for the people.
*26:40.060- 26:41.440* :  When you see the people, they are happy.
*26:41.440- 26:42.480* :  You are happy as well.
*26:43.320- 26:46.080* :  Chef Shiro ending that report from Stephanie Prentice.
*26:46.400- 26:47.400* :  And was there any left for me?
*26:47.440- 26:48.800* :  No, no, there wasn't.
*26:49.600- 26:51.340* :  Back to our top story again now,
*26:51.340- 26:53.300* :  with so many millions of people excited
*26:53.300- 26:55.040* :  by the total eclipse this week,
*26:55.480- 26:57.840* :  it's no surprise that one song in particular
*26:57.840- 26:59.240* :  made it back into the charts.
*26:59.680- 27:02.440* :  One of the time I was falling in love,
*27:02.980- 27:05.080* :  now I'm only falling apart.
*27:08.360- 27:09.820* :  It's nothing I can do,
*27:09.820- 27:12.860* :  a total eclipse of the house.
*27:13.580- 27:16.560* :  Here's the Grammy Award winning singer, Bonnie Tyler.
*27:17.660- 27:22.540* :  Well, it's number one in the iTunes chart again.
*27:22.900- 27:24.500* :  That doesn't mean megabacks,
*27:24.500- 27:25.640* :  but it's still great.
*27:25.660- 27:28.040* :  It'd be number one in America again.
*27:29.620- 27:33.120* :  Jim Steinman wrote the most iconic songs
*27:33.120- 27:38.200* :  for Meatloaf Myself, Barb Streisend, Selindion.
*27:38.820- 27:43.660* :  You know, he was just a mega superstar writer, you know.
*27:43.660- 27:46.340* :  And I always wanted to work with him
*27:46.340- 27:48.540* :  and my dream came true in the 80s.
*27:49.020- 27:51.680* :  I couldn't believe it the first time I heard this song.
*27:51.920- 27:55.100* :  How wonderful it was and that he was giving it to me.
*27:56.660- 28:00.160* :  It's like a theme song for the eclipse.
*28:00.180- 28:01.860* :  Every time it comes around, you know.
*28:02.160- 28:05.600* :  I don't think it's coming around again for how many years.
*28:05.800- 28:09.240* :  It is an incredible sort of how many people have told me
*28:09.240- 28:12.460* :  that they had their first dance to this song they fell in love
*28:13.020- 28:16.460* :  to this song and, you know, it's just amazing, you know.
*28:16.760- 28:19.400* :  And I sang it again last night and never get tired
*28:19.400- 28:21.620* :  singing it legal and crazy.
*28:22.420- 28:23.940* :  And that was Bonnie Tyler.
