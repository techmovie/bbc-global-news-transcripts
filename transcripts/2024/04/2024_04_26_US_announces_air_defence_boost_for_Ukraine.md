*01:27.800- 01:32.340* :  Anik Karachi and in the early hours of Saturday the 27th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:32.980- 01:38.520* :  The US focuses on air defenses for Ukraine, remarking $6 billion of military aid in the
*01:38.520- 01:39.540* :  war against Russia.
*01:40.100- 01:44.820* :  UN investigators dismissed one case and suspend three others against employees from the UN
*01:44.820- 01:50.640* :  Agency for Palestinian refugees, accused of involvement in the Hamas October 7th attacks.
*01:51.300- 01:56.960* :  And a lot of the crops are farmers in parts of Afghanistan is actually rotting, so it
*01:56.960- 02:00.540* :  is having a profound impact on people's livelihoods.
*02:00.640- 02:04.540* :  Climate change brings even more suffering to Taliban run Afghanistan.
*02:07.400- 02:12.480* :  Also in this podcast, King Charles is to resume some public duties while he continues
*02:12.480- 02:13.340* :  his cancer treatment.
*02:13.800- 02:16.700* :  And imagine running this marathon at the age of 76.
*02:16.820- 02:25.040* :  Day 1-31 kilometers, day 2-40.8 kilometers, day 3 was 85 kilometers, that was a tough day.
*02:28.980- 02:33.560* :  After a huge foreign aid bill was recently approved in Washington, the United States has announced
*02:33.560- 02:37.880* :  details of where $6 billion of military aid on Ukraine will be spent.
*02:38.380- 02:41.880* :  Despite pressure from Kiev, the package doesn't include new Patriot launches.
*02:42.340- 02:46.420* :  At the Pentagon, the US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said rather than focusing too much
*02:46.420- 02:51.240* :  on that, the goal should be to assist Ukraine in developing an effective missile defense
*02:51.240- 02:51.800* :  system.
*02:52.140- 02:55.840* :  I would caution us all in terms of making Patriot the silver bullet.
*02:56.640- 03:01.420* :  I would say that it's going to be the integrated air and missile defenses we've said so many
*03:01.420- 03:05.060* :  times before, that really turns a tie.
*03:05.640- 03:10.780* :  And so there are other capabilities that we really pushed hard to get, and we may be able
*03:10.780- 03:16.400* :  to get to the Ukrainians a bit faster, but this work continues on.
*03:16.860- 03:21.520* :  Our correspondent in Washington, Will Vermin, has more details about what this announcement
*03:21.520- 03:22.380* :  means for Ukraine.
*03:22.720- 03:27.740* :  This is separate from that big major aid bill, the $61 billion that was passed by Congress
*03:28.220- 03:28.960* :  a few days ago.
*03:28.960- 03:33.540* :  This is an extra $6 billion the Pentagon has found basically down the back of the sofa,
*03:34.180- 03:39.960* :  and it'll be used to buy kit like weapons, ammunition, other equipment from US defense
*03:39.960- 03:42.300* :  contractors, and then sent to Ukraine.
*03:42.840- 03:47.260* :  So it includes missiles for the Patriot system, and also another air defense system
*03:47.260- 03:50.420* :  called NASAMs, and counter drone systems too.
*03:50.580- 03:54.360* :  This will all come, as I say, from arms manufacturers here in the US.
*03:54.360- 03:56.360* :  Now that could take time, of course.
*03:56.880- 04:01.540* :  Some of these weapons will need to be built and shipped, but one of the key parts of it
*04:01.580- 04:02.900* :  is artillery ammunition.
*04:02.980- 04:06.300* :  This is something Ukraine has been critically short of recently.
*04:06.300- 04:11.420* :  The Ukrainians say Russia has been outgunning them on the battlefield by a ratio of 10-1,
*04:11.500- 04:14.360* :  so for every 10 artillery shells the Russians have been firing.
*04:14.380- 04:16.820* :  The Ukrainians have only had enough for one.
*04:17.040- 04:20.720* :  And making the announcement today, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles
*04:20.720- 04:25.800* :  Brown, he said, this package, as well as the $61 billion supplemental that was passed
*04:25.820- 04:30.280* :  a few days ago, they should eliminate that shell shortage very quickly indeed.
*04:30.280- 04:31.640* :  That's an important point.
*04:32.120- 04:34.540* :  And this is a substantial amount of money, $6 billion.
*04:34.540- 04:39.520* :  It's the largest the US has committed so far from this particular pot of money.
*04:39.800- 04:46.060* :  And I suppose interesting in how the Ukrainians will react will is what is not in this package.
*04:46.960- 04:51.100* :  Yes, so this announcement was made following a meeting of the so-called Ukraine contact groups.
*04:51.140- 04:55.200* :  This is a grouping of around 50 countries who all support Ukraine.
*04:55.200- 04:58.060* :  It includes every single NATO member country.
*04:58.480- 05:01.800* :  And President Zelensky actually joined their meeting himself personally today.
*05:02.260- 05:06.880* :  And called again, said that Ukraine needs patriot systems and not just initiatives.
*05:07.280- 05:11.060* :  But he did thank the Americans at Lloyd Austin, the US defense secretary.
*05:11.060- 05:12.100* :  You heard him just there, didn't you?
*05:12.100- 05:15.920* :  He said he's been talking to European allies about providing more systems.
*05:16.420- 05:20.420* :  And so he hopes additional capabilities will become available soon.
*05:20.420- 05:23.480* :  So I think that'll be a big relief if that happens for the Ukrainians.
*05:23.940- 05:25.040* :  Will Vernon in Washington?
*05:25.820- 05:27.980* :  The American Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken,
*05:27.980- 05:31.220* :  has said the US is prepared to take steps against China.
*05:31.660- 05:35.460* :  If it continues to supply Russia with items used for its war in Ukraine,
*05:36.080- 05:40.420* :  Anthony Blinken was speaking to the BBC after talks with President Xi Jinping,
*05:40.420- 05:42.840* :  speaking to our China correspondent Laura Bicker,
*05:43.200- 05:45.420* :  Mr. Blinken urged co-operation where possible,
*05:45.420- 05:50.840* :  but said the US was not ducking from some of the things that divide China and the West.
*05:51.420- 05:52.340* :  Let's hear some of the interview.
*05:52.820- 05:57.420* :  What we're focused on is maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
*05:57.780- 05:59.260* :  It's an interest of countries around the world.
*05:59.260- 06:03.580* :  50% of commercial container traffic goes through that strait every single day.
*06:03.580- 06:09.600* :  70% of the semiconductors that the world relies on for everything from dishwasher to cars
*06:09.600- 06:12.180* :  to our iPhones made in Taiwan.
*06:12.180- 06:15.440* :  So everyone has an interest in making sure that peace and stability is preserved.
*06:15.940- 06:17.200* :  We've had a long-standing policy.
*06:17.460- 06:21.980* :  It's a one-china policy, but that also includes making sure that Taiwan has the ability
*06:21.980- 06:26.600* :  to defend itself, and the assistance that we provide to them and provide them for decades
*06:26.600- 06:28.180* :  is commensurate with the threat.
*06:28.560- 06:30.740* :  That's actually a way of deterring.
*06:30.820- 06:31.760* :  They may see it differently.
*06:31.980- 06:38.680* :  You came to ask Beijing to stop supplying Moscow with components that Russia is using
*06:38.680- 06:40.320* :  in its invasion of Ukraine.
*06:40.720- 06:42.280* :  You've asked them to do this before.
*06:42.280- 06:46.080* :  What makes you think that they will listen to you this time?
*06:46.620- 06:48.280* :  Let's be clear about what's happening and what's not happening.
*06:48.280- 06:54.360* :  What's not happening is provision of actual arms by China to Russia for use in Ukraine
*06:54.360- 06:56.880* :  and at the very start of Russia's aggression.
*06:57.300- 07:01.620* :  We make clear to China that that was unacceptable, and we've not seen them do that.
*07:01.960- 07:06.260* :  But what China is doing, or what some of the enterprises are doing, is to provide critical
*07:06.260- 07:11.800* :  components for Russia's defense industrial base, machine tools, microelectronics, and optics.
*07:11.860- 07:18.640* :  These are being used to help Russia on what's an extraordinary crash-course effort to make
*07:18.640- 07:21.780* :  more munitions, tanks, armored vehicles, missiles.
*07:21.780- 07:27.420* :  The actions that Russia has taken are going at a pace unlike any we've seen in its modern
*07:27.420- 07:31.540* :  history, including the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and this could not be happening
*07:31.540- 07:33.740* :  without the support that China is providing.
*07:33.780- 07:39.020* :  It's helping Russia perpetuate its aggression against Ukraine, but it's also creating a
*07:39.020- 07:41.960* :  growing threat to Europe because of Russia's aggression.
*07:42.340- 07:45.580* :  And what I'm hearing from Europeans is deep concern about this.
*07:45.860- 07:50.600* :  So for China, if it wants to have better relations, not only with us, but with countries
*07:50.600- 07:55.320* :  in Europe, it can't do that while at the same time, helping to fuel the biggest threat
*07:55.320- 07:57.100* :  to European security since the end of the Cold War.
*07:57.220- 08:01.120* :  We've taken action already against Chinese entities that are engaged in this.
*08:01.200- 08:04.120* :  What I made clear today is that if China won't act, we will.
*08:04.360- 08:06.020* :  What will those actions involve?
*08:06.540- 08:09.920* :  I'm not going to get into the details except to say, look at what we've done already.
*08:09.920- 08:14.880* :  We've imposed sanctions, export controls on more than 100 Chinese entities because of
*08:14.880- 08:18.700* :  their involvement in helping Russia with its defense industrial base, and we're fully
*08:18.700- 08:20.180* :  prepared to take further action.
*08:20.940- 08:25.560* :  U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, our Asia-Pacific regional editor, Celia Hatton,
*08:25.920- 08:27.660* :  gave me her assessment of the meeting.
*08:28.180- 08:32.860* :  Anthony Blinken was unusually harsh, I thought, considering he was actually in the Chinese
*08:32.860- 08:39.180* :  capital when he was making his remarks, basically accusing Beijing of fueling the war in Ukraine,
*08:39.780- 08:45.640* :  not by supplying outright weapons, but what Beijing is doing, according to the Americans,
*08:45.640- 08:51.560* :  is supplying a lot of dual use components and technology, which the Russians are then
*08:51.560- 08:55.660* :  using to fashion into weapons that they're using against the Ukrainians.
*08:56.260- 09:03.020* :  The Chinese position on this is basically to accuse Washington of being completely hypocritical
*09:03.160- 09:10.980* :  by saying, look, you have just signed a $61 billion package that hands weapons to the Israelis
*09:10.980- 09:18.000* :  to Taiwan that actually $8 billion of that package is going to give weapons to counter China's
*09:18.000- 09:19.080* :  rise in the region.
*09:19.080- 09:23.160* :  And so they would say, you're handing weapons out right left and center.
*09:23.640- 09:24.440* :  What's the issue?
*09:24.820- 09:27.300* :  What do you make of the general tone between these two men?
*09:27.300- 09:32.040* :  And I suppose we should ask general relations between the United States and China.
*09:32.200- 09:38.620* :  Well, the relationship has improved a lot since August 2022, when the then-house speaker
*09:38.620- 09:40.640* :  Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan.
*09:40.640- 09:42.760* :  That put relations in a deep freeze.
*09:42.900- 09:48.800* :  They went even to a lower point, I would say, after the United States took down a suspected
*09:48.800- 09:51.920* :  Chinese surveillance balloon just a few months after that.
*09:52.020- 09:56.400* :  The two sides are really rebuilding their relationship right now, but I would say that
*09:56.400- 10:01.500* :  their frenemies, they have accepted that they need each other to solve many of their key
*10:01.500- 10:06.760* :  problems, whether it comes to trade, issues in the Middle East, the Russia-Ukraine conflict,
*10:07.240- 10:08.720* :  they can't do without each other.
*10:08.880- 10:13.720* :  And so they have to find a way to work together, and that was the tone of a lot of the remarks
*10:13.720- 10:18.260* :  that we've heard publicly from Antony Blinken, and also from Xi Jinping.
*10:18.260- 10:22.380* :  I mean, Xi Jinping, frankly, was quite poetic in his remarks today.
*10:22.460- 10:27.360* :  So for example, he says, today, as I see it, dwellers of the same planet should help each
*10:28.800- 10:28.820* :  other.
*10:28.820- 10:31.480* :  We live in an interdependent world and rise and fall together.
*10:31.480- 10:35.780* :  I mean, he just emphasized over and over again how he wants the relationship to stabilize.
*10:35.780- 10:39.340* :  So the relationship has stabilized, but they both have their red lines.
*10:39.440- 10:46.500* :  It's the provision of help to Russia for the United States, and it's the issue of Taiwan
*10:46.500- 10:47.220* :  for China.
*10:48.080- 10:48.840* :  Celia Hatton.
*10:49.820- 10:54.460* :  There's been an development in an investigation into Israeli allegations against the UN Agency
*10:54.460- 10:55.780* :  for Palestinian refugees.
*10:55.900- 11:01.980* :  The agency Unruha was embroiled in controversy in January, when the Israelis said a dozen
*11:01.980- 11:05.520* :  employees had been involved in the Hamas attacks on October 7.
*11:05.580- 11:08.100* :  It caused many countries to pull their funding.
*11:08.600- 11:12.900* :  Well, now UN investigators have closed one case and suspended three others.
*11:13.140- 11:16.160* :  Our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Usher, has been telling me more.
*11:16.620- 11:24.020* :  What has been announced today by the UN spokesperson is that one of those cases has been closed
*11:24.020- 11:29.560* :  because, essentially, they said that they'd not received any evidence from Israel, but
*11:29.580- 11:30.560* :  backed up the allegations.
*11:30.620- 11:35.400* :  They closed three others have been suspended, saying only insufficient information has been
*11:35.400- 11:36.460* :  received from Israel.
*11:36.980- 11:40.460* :  So it's impossible to carry out a full investigation at the moment.
*11:40.460- 11:46.420* :  The other cases are being investigated, but if you go back to when Israel made his accusations
*11:46.620- 11:51.200* :  back in January, and this work gets a bit murky because it's unclear exactly where we
*11:51.200- 11:51.560* :  are with this.
*11:51.700- 11:57.540* :  The fired ten of those twelve staff immediately, and they said the remaining two were dead.
*11:58.240- 12:03.340* :  So presumably, the implication of this is that even the two who are dead are still being
*12:03.340- 12:08.240* :  investigated as to whether they did have direct involvement in the October 7 attacks.
*12:08.780- 12:11.900* :  Has Israel had anything to say about these interim findings?
*12:12.500- 12:17.680* :  I mean, Israel's position is that it's not just UN, it sees the UN as well as essentially
*12:17.680- 12:20.880* :  being an entity that is predisposed against Israel.
*12:21.580- 12:28.420* :  So it would dismiss reports that are being issued by UN investigators as, again, part
*12:28.420- 12:29.100* :  of that bias.
*12:29.580- 12:33.840* :  So where are we with funding of various countries for Unruh?
*12:33.900- 12:39.180* :  We know a number of nations had pulled money from supporting this agency.
*12:39.380- 12:43.940* :  Unruh depends on having funding from Foreign donors.
*12:43.940- 12:48.980* :  I think around half of the funding it gets is from the US, and the US was one of the countries
*12:49.780- 12:53.220* :  that immediately suspended all its funds to Unruh.
*12:53.440- 12:55.960* :  Now there hasn't been a change as yet from the US.
*12:56.620- 13:01.000* :  There hasn't been a change from the UK, but we have seen Germany just in the last couple
*13:01.000- 13:04.320* :  of days has said that it will resume funding.
*13:04.420- 13:06.600* :  We've seen that with several other countries as well.
*13:06.860- 13:12.980* :  That will not get anywhere close to the sort of funding that Unruh needs in order to provide
*13:12.980- 13:18.060* :  the needs, not just of the refugees in Gaza, but in the occupied West Bank, in Lebanon,
*13:18.060- 13:19.700* :  Syria and in Jordan.
*13:20.320- 13:21.380* :  Sebastian Usher there.
*13:22.460- 13:26.820* :  Should medically assisted dying be made legal and for whom?
*13:27.420- 13:31.080* :  It's a question being intensely debated in several countries at the moment.
*13:31.300- 13:37.920* :  In Canada, medical assistance in dying or made is already allowed for adults with a terminal
*13:37.920- 13:43.140* :  illness or serious and chronic medical conditions, but the government there has also been considering
*13:43.140- 13:47.900* :  whether to extend it to people who suffer solely from a mental illness that sparked a
*13:47.900- 13:50.940* :  fierce debate and this year the government decided to delay.
*13:51.420- 13:56.140* :  The BBC's Nadine Yusuf has been following the case of one man considering applying to
*13:56.140- 14:01.280* :  end his own life for the past year and a warning that this report coming up does contain
*14:01.280- 14:06.280* :  references to severe mental suffering which some of you might find distressing.
*14:08.280- 14:13.380* :  John Scully has a familiar daily routine rifling through his medicine cabinet with his wife,
*14:13.520- 14:13.920* :  Tony.
*14:14.420- 14:22.300* :  To take 30 pills a day, 3-0, that's to deal with other physical and mental problems, I've
*14:22.300- 14:28.480* :  had 19 shock therapies, it did no good, but God knows what harm it did.
*14:28.820- 14:35.080* :  John suffers from severe mental illness, he has depression, anxiety and severe PTSD following
*14:35.080- 14:41.120* :  years of work as a journalist covering conflicts including Sarajevo and the troubles in Northern
*14:41.120- 14:41.580* :  Ireland.
*14:42.020- 14:47.080* :  The riot has gathered and began to throw stones at the police, police understandably retaliating.
*14:47.500- 14:52.620* :  Fear is good, it's healthy, if you're not frightened you get killed, but I was thinking
*14:52.620- 14:58.120* :  that I have to control the fear, become and go ahead and get the story.
*14:58.560- 15:03.760* :  I started bouncing around from war zone to war zone and I've still do myself all the
*15:03.820- 15:04.140* :  time.
*15:04.720- 15:10.540* :  I paid a huge price for it, I suffer from somatic pain, chronic pain.
*15:10.960- 15:17.120* :  That means pain that I can't diagnose and assume it's psychiatric, I've been in this
*15:17.120- 15:19.800* :  condition for roughly 40 years.
*15:20.380- 15:25.740* :  After a lifetime of what he describes as intolerable suffering in various therapies or treatment,
*15:25.900- 15:29.660* :  his fighting for the right to apply for a medically assisted death.
*15:30.440- 15:34.700* :  Canada was planning to introduce medically assisted dying for those solely suffering
*15:34.700- 15:37.240* :  for mental illness in March 2024.
*15:38.120- 15:43.760* :  The controversial debate around whether Canada is ready or ever will be has been rife.
*15:44.360- 15:50.620* :  And in January, the Canadian government chose to delay by three years to 2027, saying the
*15:50.620- 15:52.060* :  country needed more time.
*15:52.380- 15:55.660* :  The medical community in Canada remains divided on this.
*15:56.220- 16:01.740* :  Dr. Sonu Gand is a professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto and a former president
*16:01.740- 16:03.880* :  of the Canadian Psychiatric Society.
*16:04.440- 16:09.280* :  He's concerned that allowing assisted death solely for mental illness could be dangerous.
*16:09.960- 16:16.200* :  All the evidence shows us that when we attempt to make predictions of irremediability in mental
*16:16.200- 16:18.560* :  illness, we are wrong more than half the time.
*16:18.880- 16:24.880* :  And I can think in my own practice of a number of people who struggled for a long time.
*16:24.880- 16:27.940* :  We tried various things, they didn't get better for a long time.
*16:28.640- 16:29.920* :  And then they did.
*16:30.540- 16:36.260* :  Dr. Shantal Paro has been a maid assessor and provider since 2016 when it was first introduced
*16:36.260- 16:37.020* :  in Canada.
*16:37.300- 16:42.440* :  She supports the expansion and for those suffering irremediably to have the right to be assessed.
*16:43.080- 16:46.520* :  Can people with these disorders live and enjoy life absolutely?
*16:47.040- 16:47.820* :  But some cannot.
*16:47.820- 16:53.440* :  And again, it's those few people who are suffering intolerably who deserve the right to be assessed
*16:53.500- 16:53.820* :  for me.
*16:54.180- 16:59.180* :  I think a lot of people don't understand just how debilitating it can be to live with the
*16:59.180- 16:59.840* :  mental disorder.
*17:00.380- 17:04.640* :  The government says this delay is essential to make sure any expansion would be safely
*17:04.640- 17:06.140* :  and adequately provided.
*17:06.740- 17:11.640* :  But with a general election expected by October next year, advocates are concerned this
*17:11.640- 17:14.940* :  three-year delay could be extended if a different party is elected.
*17:15.780- 17:17.500* :  Nadine Yusuf with that report.
*17:20.680- 17:22.360* :  Still to come on the global news podcast.
*17:22.660- 17:26.400* :  There were a lot of women coming to us, not because they were religious, but because they
*17:26.400- 17:29.360* :  were postpartum and they didn't want cutouts and their gowns anymore.
*17:29.620- 17:33.580* :  Or they were working in professional environments and they just couldn't find clothes that
*17:33.600- 17:34.460* :  suited them for that.
*17:35.300- 17:38.260* :  The astronomical rise of modest fashion.
*17:45.800- 17:51.320* :  King Charles is to return to some public duties, including hosting the Emperor and Empress
*17:51.520- 17:52.000* :  of Japan.
*17:52.400- 17:54.680* :  But he responded positively to cancer treatment.
*17:54.740- 17:59.740* :  He's been receiving care as an outpatient since early February after being diagnosed with
*17:59.740- 18:01.820* :  an unspecified form of the disease.
*18:02.320- 18:05.820* :  It was detected during treatment for an unrelated and large prostate.
*18:06.280- 18:09.540* :  Buckingham Palace has released a photograph of the King and Queen.
*18:09.860- 18:10.620* :  Here's Charlotte Gallagher.
*18:10.940- 18:15.940* :  The photo which shows the King and Queen in the gardens of Buckingham Palace is being
*18:15.940- 18:19.340* :  seen as a positive sign about the monarch's health.
*18:19.720- 18:25.500* :  The palace says the King is making encouraging progress and will shortly return to public
*18:25.500- 18:29.580* :  facing duties after a period of treatment and recuperation.
*18:30.120- 18:35.680* :  It adds the royal couple are deeply grateful for the many kindnesses and good wishes they
*18:35.680- 18:37.760* :  have received from around the world.
*18:38.440- 18:43.460* :  The King's last public appearance was in Windsor on Easter Sunday and he surprised the crowds
*18:43.460- 18:44.560* :  by stopping to chat.
*18:45.100- 18:48.500* :  His next visit will be fittingly to a cancer treatment centre.
*18:49.220- 18:53.160* :  There is no news about when the Princess of Wales will return to public duties.
*18:53.720- 18:59.800* :  She announced her cancer diagnosis in March and has asked for time, space and privacy for
*18:59.800- 19:01.300* :  herself and her family.
*19:01.620- 19:02.460* :  Charlotte Gallagher.
*19:03.200- 19:07.240* :  The authorities in Kenya say the number of people killed in severe flooding has risen
*19:07.240- 19:07.920* :  to 70.
*19:07.920- 19:13.080* :  Kenya and other countries in East Africa, a region highly vulnerable to climate change,
*19:13.520- 19:18.380* :  have seen heavier than usual rainfall in recent weeks exacerbated by the El Niño
*19:18.380- 19:23.700* :  weather pattern, at least 150 people have died in neighbouring Tanzania, Richard Hamilton
*19:23.700- 19:24.060* :  reports.
*19:24.620- 19:29.540* :  Kenyans have been warned to stay on higher alert with more heavy rain forecast across
*19:29.540- 19:34.060* :  the country, as the monsoon continues to battery St Africa.
*19:34.620- 19:39.600* :  The extreme weather has caused chaos in the capital Nairobi this week, blocking roads
*19:39.600- 19:42.280* :  and engulfing homes in slum districts.
*19:43.260- 19:49.460* :  On Thursday, the Tanzanian Prime Minister Kasim Majaliwa said more than 200,000 people
*19:49.460- 19:55.580* :  had been affected by the disaster, and that homes, property, crops, schools and infrastructure
*19:55.580- 19:58.060* :  had either been damaged or destroyed.
*19:58.860- 20:05.120* :  In Burundi, nearly 100,000 people have been displaced by the months of relentless rain.
*20:05.880- 20:11.980* :  And earlier this week, the United Nations Humanitarian Response Agency, Ocha, said rains
*20:11.980- 20:17.160* :  were intensifying in Somalia, with flash floods reported in recent days.
*20:18.060- 20:23.860* :  Uganda has also suffered heavy storms that have caused river banks to burst with several
*20:23.860- 20:25.620* :  hundred villagers displaced.
*20:26.360- 20:27.300* :  That was Richard Hamilton.
*20:28.260- 20:32.280* :  When it comes to the problems Afghanistan is facing, climate change doesn't immediately
*20:32.280- 20:33.180* :  spring to mind.
*20:33.580- 20:35.860* :  But the country is actually one of the most vulnerable.
*20:36.140- 20:40.620* :  Afghanistan has been largely omissilated by the international community since the Taliban
*20:40.620- 20:46.000* :  regained control and reintroduced extremely harsh restrictions on women and girls' rights
*20:46.060- 20:46.840* :  and freedoms.
*20:46.840- 20:51.120* :  But this week, international agencies held the first talks there about climate change
*20:51.120- 20:54.520* :  co-hosted by the Norwegian Afghanistan Committee.
*20:55.100- 21:00.060* :  It's director Tehrir Watadal told James Menendez about Afghanistan's plight.
*21:00.500- 21:02.740* :  It is one of the most vulnerable countries.
*21:02.740- 21:08.820* :  I think it's ranked number six internationally, and it's the country that is the least prepared
*21:08.820- 21:10.860* :  for the impact of climate change.
*21:11.180- 21:14.500* :  Just as an example today, it has been raining heavily.
*21:14.540- 21:19.160* :  Tomorrow, we are expecting 34 millimeter of rain.
*21:19.160- 21:21.520* :  This is not common in April.
*21:21.980- 21:24.500* :  This is actually the beginning of harvest season.
*21:24.500- 21:29.720* :  So a lot of the crops are farmers in parts of Afghanistan is actually rotting.
*21:30.300- 21:34.360* :  So it is having a profound impact on people's livelihoods.
*21:34.620- 21:39.540* :  People are already at rock bottom, particularly when it comes to access to food, aren't they?
*21:39.740- 21:43.720* :  They are. Both the change of government back in August 2021,
*21:44.640- 21:47.360* :  the following sanctions from the international community,
*21:47.360- 21:51.680* :  the war on Ukraine, which has led to increased food prices.
*21:52.160- 21:55.420* :  And then on top of that, you have changing weather patterns.
*21:55.420- 21:59.720* :  So this is a dire situation for the Afghan people.
*21:59.720- 22:03.920* :  For example, in one of the northern provinces where we work in Barakshan,
*22:04.300- 22:08.880* :  it's one of the provinces that are most vulnerable to natural disasters.
*22:09.120- 22:11.840* :  And of course, when heavy rain is coming like now,
*22:12.000- 22:14.260* :  the soil of this finer than sand.
*22:14.600- 22:17.460* :  And with the heavy rain at this time of the year,
*22:17.920- 22:20.400* :  it leads to massive landslides,
*22:20.440- 22:24.240* :  erosion, a long little brooks and big rivers, rock falls.
*22:24.240- 22:30.180* :  So about 10% of the arable land in Barakshan disappears every single year.
*22:30.680- 22:35.560* :  So Afghanistan is really at the brink of, in many way, an environmental collapse.
*22:36.520- 22:39.120* :  In parts of the country, since 1950,
*22:39.280- 22:44.300* :  there has been an increase in temperature of more than 2.5 degrees Celsius.
*22:44.600- 22:48.900* :  Afghanistan is really extremely vulnerable to climate change,
*22:48.900- 22:52.040* :  more than most other countries in Asia.
*22:52.360- 22:57.380* :  Given all that, how seriously do Taliban officials take the threat?
*22:57.480- 23:00.520* :  I think this symposium that we had earlier this week
*23:00.540- 23:03.800* :  was approved for the government actually taking it seriously.
*23:03.800- 23:06.320* :  When I came here about 10 years ago,
*23:06.320- 23:09.060* :  we could dig 50 meters and we would find water.
*23:09.400- 23:11.500* :  Now it's down to more than 200 meters.
*23:11.900- 23:15.340* :  So they're very much aware of the impact of climate change.
*23:15.340- 23:17.780* :  So I do feel that they are taking it seriously.
*23:17.900- 23:20.180* :  In the past, they would say, well, this is God's will.
*23:20.180- 23:23.360* :  Now it is much more the discussion that, okay,
*23:23.360- 23:26.560* :  we are not really appreciating the earth.
*23:26.820- 23:28.880* :  And this is why we are being punished.
*23:28.880- 23:30.760* :  So I do feel there has been a change.
*23:31.640- 23:34.880* :  And that is good because action is necessary now.
*23:35.460- 23:40.000* :  Afghanistan is contributing with 0.06 percent
*23:40.640- 23:42.160* :  of greenhouse gas emissions.
*23:42.940- 23:45.380* :  So the problems come to Afghanistan from outside.
*23:45.380- 23:47.120* :  So I think it's nothing but fear
*23:47.320- 23:49.360* :  that the international community supports
*23:49.500- 23:52.580* :  through UN agencies, through technical assistance
*23:52.580- 23:56.040* :  to the technical agencies under the government.
*23:56.100- 23:59.120* :  But also through international and national NGOs.
*23:59.180- 24:02.460* :  But they can definitely not manage this by themselves.
*24:03.220- 24:04.480* :  Terry, what a dull there
*24:04.480- 24:07.620* :  of the Norwegian Afghanistan community in Kabul.
*24:08.720- 24:11.780* :  Now thousands of models, designers and buyers
*24:11.780- 24:14.000* :  have descended on Istanbul in Turkey.
*24:14.420- 24:15.760* :  But modest fashion week,
*24:16.080- 24:18.760* :  valued at hundreds of billions of dollars, modest fashion,
*24:18.820- 24:19.740* :  is a booming sector.
*24:20.160- 24:23.160* :  As more women look to cover up for religious or personal reasons,
*24:23.660- 24:25.360* :  but still want to stay on trend.
*24:25.360- 24:27.600* :  The BBC's Megan Lawton reports on the brands
*24:27.600- 24:29.260* :  that are looking to cash in.
*24:29.820- 24:32.760* :  Once associated with flowing buyers and floor length
*24:32.760- 24:35.280* :  caftans, modest fashion is changing.
*24:37.220- 24:39.100* :  In this video from last year, models
*24:39.100- 24:42.500* :  are wearing leather skirts, cowboy hats, and feather boars.
*24:42.760- 24:44.240* :  For modest fashion week founder,
*24:44.240- 24:47.900* :  Oslem Sahin Ertas, it's important her runways
*24:47.900- 24:50.040* :  reflects the evolution of the style.
*24:50.320- 24:52.660* :  For us, the modesty is not related
*24:52.660- 24:56.460* :  to any social religious or cultural background.
*24:56.680- 24:59.460* :  According to the recent states of the Global Islamic Economy
*24:59.460- 25:01.920* :  report, by research firm Diana Standard,
*25:01.920- 25:04.400* :  Muslims spend on clothing in 2022
*25:04.400- 25:07.960* :  was $318 billion US dollars.
*25:08.480- 25:12.080* :  That's a rise of 8.4% compared to the previous year.
*25:12.480- 25:15.780* :  I think we just had a really rapid growth within the Gen Z
*25:16.380- 25:17.880* :  and within the Western world.
*25:18.280- 25:20.840* :  Mahogandal is a modest fashion content creator
*25:20.840- 25:23.260* :  who was born in Pakistan, but grew up
*25:23.260- 25:24.800* :  in Toronto in Canada.

*25:33.000- 25:33.620* :  and Versace.
*25:34.100- 25:36.220* :  Hi guys, let's get a minute with me for tonight
*25:36.220- 25:37.420* :  using a folder now.
*25:37.700- 25:40.220* :  One of the reasons the industry has grown so rapidly
*25:40.220- 25:41.460* :  is social media.
*25:41.720- 25:45.700* :  The hashtag modest has had 7.2 billion views on TikTok.
*25:45.960- 25:46.800* :  I had little girls.
*25:46.940- 25:48.860* :  They would reach out and be like, oh my god,
*25:49.000- 25:51.960* :  you're the first brown girl from within our community
*25:51.960- 25:55.220* :  who we can actually look up to when I first moved to Canada.
*25:55.220- 25:59.200* :  I didn't see a Muslim girl, let alone a brown girl
*25:59.600- 26:02.600* :  on a billboard, but now you're able to see that.
*26:02.960- 26:04.780* :  Modest fashion is gaining popularity
*26:04.780- 26:06.540* :  with women from all backgrounds.

*26:13.320- 26:15.320* :  who are Jewish, Muslim and Christian,
*26:15.340- 26:17.940* :  but also women from non-faith backgrounds.
*26:18.540- 26:21.880* :  It's run by Ariela Imamin and Liza Hockeen.
*26:22.180- 26:23.440* :  There were a lot of women coming to us,
*26:23.520- 26:24.500* :  not because they were religious,
*26:24.880- 26:26.640* :  but because they were postpartum
*26:26.640- 26:28.900* :  and they didn't want cutouts in their gowns anymore.
*26:29.120- 26:31.680* :  Or they were working in professional environments
*26:31.740- 26:32.940* :  and they just couldn't find clothes
*26:32.940- 26:33.980* :  that suited them for that.
*26:34.160- 26:37.220* :  Ariela also highlights the current trend of old money,
*26:37.680- 26:40.320* :  a style gaining popularity thanks to celebrities
*26:40.320- 26:41.800* :  like Sophia Richie.
*26:41.940- 26:44.100* :  10 tips to creating that old money style.
*26:44.100- 26:46.580* :  Instead of flashy logos and bold prints,
*26:46.980- 26:50.340* :  this style is about embracing classic wardrobe staples.
*26:50.340- 26:54.840* :  That whole classy, almost timeless luxury style
*26:54.840- 26:56.980* :  goes hand in hand with the modest fashion as well.
*26:57.100- 26:59.680* :  The state of the Global Islamic Economy Report
*27:00.440- 27:02.640* :  estimates the global modest fashion industry
*27:02.640- 27:08.280* :  will grow to $428 billion US dollars by 2027.
*27:09.400- 27:11.360* :  Meghan Lawton reporting and you can hear more
*27:11.360- 27:12.880* :  by searching for business daily
*27:12.880- 27:15.040* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*27:16.220- 27:18.180* :  Now at 254 kilometers,
*27:18.560- 27:20.620* :  the marathon day Sabla in Morocco
*27:21.200- 27:23.500* :  is the equivalent of running six marathons
*27:23.500- 27:25.080* :  over seven days in temperatures
*27:25.600- 27:27.940* :  that can exceed 50 degrees Celsius.
*27:28.320- 27:30.440* :  So imagine it, climbing and descending
*27:30.440- 27:33.140* :  through the rolling sand dunes of a Sahara
*27:33.460- 27:36.260* :  while carrying the food and supplies you need for the day.
*27:36.900- 27:39.120* :  It's described as the toughest of the foot races
*27:39.320- 27:40.620* :  and even those in the prime of life
*27:40.660- 27:42.620* :  have found it too much to bear.
*27:42.880- 27:44.840* :  So, spare a thought for Harry Hunter
*27:44.840- 27:46.780* :  who has just become the oldest Britain
*27:46.780- 27:50.100* :  to complete the race at the age of 76,
*27:50.100- 27:52.220* :  raising money for children's hospice.
*27:52.560- 27:53.500* :  It's all Julian Marshall
*27:53.500- 27:56.000* :  why he took on such a grueling challenge.
*27:56.560- 27:58.180* :  I have been doing these sort of races
*27:58.180- 27:59.680* :  for about 10 years anyway
*28:00.080- 28:02.700* :  and I did a lot of racing altars and marathons
*28:02.700- 28:03.740* :  and everything before that.
*28:03.920- 28:06.500* :  This one, the iconic one, it's the original one.
*28:06.960- 28:10.920* :  Because I knew that if I finished over
*28:10.920- 28:13.980* :  the oldest British finisher in the history of the race.
*28:14.580- 28:15.560* :  How long did it take you?
*28:15.700- 28:17.280* :  There was about 54 hours.
*28:17.940- 28:21.440* :  There was 860 who ever started the race.
*28:21.760- 28:26.860* :  But I finished 508 and my bib number was 508.
*28:28.380- 28:29.800* :  Which is spooky really.
*28:29.940- 28:32.420* :  Were there moments when you thought you wouldn't make it?
*28:32.680- 28:33.920* :  No, I love experience.
*28:34.120- 28:34.480* :  It's tough.
*28:34.520- 28:37.940* :  They classify it the toughest foot race on the planet.
*28:38.360- 28:39.800* :  You only eat what you've got in your back
*28:39.800- 28:42.840* :  and all they give you throughout the race is water.
*28:43.180- 28:45.640* :  And at night you go back into this Bivarka area
*28:45.640- 28:47.200* :  and you have somewhere you can sleep
*28:47.200- 28:49.020* :  but you still have to carry on sleeping here.
*28:49.600- 28:52.720* :  And basically it was day 131 kilometers,
*28:53.380- 28:56.180* :  day 240.8 kilometers.
*28:56.700- 28:58.520* :  Day three was 85 kilometers.
*28:58.520- 28:59.680* :  That was a tough day.
*29:00.300- 29:02.320* :  I was out in the ground for over 22 hours.
*29:03.220- 29:05.060* :  And then the fourth day of running
*29:05.060- 29:07.280* :  just plus 43 kilometers.
*29:08.000- 29:10.060* :  And then the next day was 31 again
*29:10.060- 29:12.200* :  and the last day was 21 kilometers.
*29:12.860- 29:14.100* :  And what was the terrain like?
*29:14.960- 29:17.920* :  Sand dunes, jettles, climbs,
*29:18.620- 29:21.100* :  lots and sand everywhere, it's stunning.
*29:21.380- 29:24.040* :  There's nothing in the whole time I was running.
*29:24.040- 29:25.960* :  I've seen I think four wild camels
*29:26.220- 29:28.100* :  and some animals I thought might have been goats
*29:28.100- 29:30.120* :  with long legs, I was sure of this.
*29:30.420- 29:31.200* :  So I didn't know what they were.
*29:31.580- 29:33.600* :  And just beetles that run through the sand.
*29:34.240- 29:36.500* :  You look at it and think, well, this is a place where
*29:36.920- 29:39.480* :  if you went wrong, you're not going to come out of it
*29:39.480- 29:41.020* :  because there's just nothing there.
*29:41.020- 29:41.860* :  There's no water.
*29:41.860- 29:43.020* :  There's no anything.
*29:43.320- 29:45.160* :  Are you running on your own or?
*29:45.660- 29:46.880* :  Well, no, it sets off.
*29:46.900- 29:48.320* :  You're running with other people.
*29:48.700- 29:50.060* :  Sometimes you can be on your own,
*29:50.080- 29:51.840* :  but you can see people in front of you
*29:51.840- 29:52.820* :  and there's people behind.
*29:53.240- 29:54.020* :  You follow markers.
*29:54.780- 29:55.980* :  And they can pull you out anytime.
*29:55.980- 29:57.380* :  They're checking you all the time.
*29:57.380- 29:58.620* :  Make sure you're not going to kill yourself.
*29:58.920- 30:00.420* :  I mean, when you reach your age,
*30:00.420- 30:05.100* :  I mean, the medical advice is to avoid high impact excesses.
*30:05.320- 30:07.720* :  Your knees start to go, your hips start to go,
*30:07.960- 30:09.340* :  but that hasn't been happening to you.
*30:09.760- 30:10.320* :  No, at all.
*30:10.600- 30:11.400* :  I'm very lucky, man.
*30:11.420- 30:15.000* :  So, I mean, I'm not sort of trying to blow my own trumpet,
*30:15.240- 30:18.880* :  but I do believe that I'm a lot fitter than possibly people
*30:18.880- 30:20.960* :  who are a lot younger than me.
*30:21.300- 30:23.760* :  And so the secret is just to keep going, isn't it?
*30:23.860- 30:25.560* :  Always, yes. Never stop.
*30:26.000- 30:28.180* :  I've been doing a lot of this for a lot of my life.
*30:28.520- 30:30.920* :  I mean, I hope in four years' time, I'm 80.
*30:31.480- 30:32.300* :  I'll still be there.
*30:32.780- 30:34.340* :  I don't see any reason why I know.
*30:34.580- 30:37.280* :  I still got the gym, I still work hard, I still run.
*30:37.620- 30:39.140* :  That's why I want to carry on doing it.
*30:39.580- 30:40.340* :  And well done to him.
*30:40.340- 30:42.220* :  That's Harry Hunter, the oldest Britain
*30:42.700- 30:47.020* :  to complete the marathon, Desablet or Marathon of the Sands.
*30:48.180- 30:50.500* :  Mike Pinder, the last surviving founding member
*30:50.500- 30:52.120* :  of the English rock band, The Moody Blues,
*30:52.120- 30:53.660* :  has died at the age of 82.
*30:54.320- 30:55.640* :  Pinder, who played the keyboard,
*30:55.640- 30:59.140* :  helped form the group in Birmingham in the mid 1960s.
*30:59.420- 31:01.920* :  They went on to reach the top of the charts three times
*31:01.920- 31:04.640* :  in the UK and twice in the US.
*31:04.960- 31:06.820* :  Our culture correspondent, Lizzo Mazzimba,
*31:07.200- 31:09.580* :  looks back at the life of the Melatron man.
*31:12.840- 31:15.680* :  Mike Pinder's piano introduction to The Moody Blues
*31:15.700- 31:19.340* :  first hit, Go Now, a number one in 1964.
*31:23.880- 31:26.580* :  But it was his introduction of a new instrument,
*31:26.580- 31:30.520* :  the Melatron, that gave the band its unique sound.
*31:31.040- 31:33.280* :  Pressing keys on its keyboard, triggered
*31:33.280- 31:36.120* :  the playing of pre-recorded audio tape.
*31:36.440- 31:38.440* :  It was often described as a keyboard
*31:38.440- 31:40.500* :  with the power of an orchestra,
*31:40.860- 31:43.120* :  but with an otherworldly quality.
*31:50.360- 31:52.620* :  Mike Pinder first came across the Melatron
*31:52.940- 31:55.920* :  when he answered an advert from an electronics firm
*31:56.260- 31:58.680* :  looking for someone to help with the new invention.
*31:59.000- 32:00.340* :  That's how I'm a man, you know.
*32:01.040- 32:03.560* :  I started working with them, went through the whole process
*32:03.560- 32:04.860* :  of how the Melatron was built.
*32:05.560- 32:06.740* :  It's conception and everything.
*32:07.560- 32:09.480* :  And then ended up being the tester,
*32:09.780- 32:12.060* :  so that when the machines came off the line,
*32:12.240- 32:15.260* :  I would totally go through the machine, play it, things like that.
*32:17.980- 32:20.100* :  Pinder used the Melatron extensively
*32:20.100- 32:22.020* :  on the band's early albums,
*32:22.820- 32:25.140* :  and he inspired its use by others,
*32:25.180- 32:28.640* :  recommending it to John Lennon and Paul McCartney,
*32:28.940- 32:31.820* :  who used it on the song Strawberry Fields Forever.
*32:33.620- 32:37.040* :  Pinder left the Moody Blues in the late 1970s,
*32:37.420- 32:40.300* :  but he was instrumental in giving the band
*32:40.360- 32:43.480* :  a 60s, dreamy, psychedelic sound
*32:43.880- 32:45.500* :  that was copied by Somme.
*32:53.680- 32:55.540* :  Lizzo Missimba, on the life of Mike Pinder
*32:55.540- 32:58.860* :  from the Moody Blues, who has died at the age of 82.
*33:01.140- 33:02.020* :  And that's all from us for now,
*33:02.020- 33:04.860* :  but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
