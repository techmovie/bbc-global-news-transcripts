*01:25.120- 01:29.540* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is being recorded at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday,
*01:29.540- 01:34.960* :  the 17th of April. Ukraine says a Russian attack that killed 14 people could have been
*01:34.960- 01:40.900* :  prevented if allies had provided more defense equipment. The UN says inequalities in healthcare
*01:40.900- 01:46.180* :  around the world are literally killing women. And the young men fleeing Myanmar to avoid
*01:46.220- 01:53.460* :  conscription. Also in the podcast, the British and German foreign ministers are in Israel to try
*01:53.460- 02:00.480* :  to prevent a wider war after Iran's attack at the weekend. And to read or not to read this book,
*02:00.480- 02:05.940* :  it's in your hands. So take a look, the plays by gentle Shakespeare here with pictures through
*02:05.940- 02:12.800* :  each play appear. Trying to get children to enjoy Shakespeare. Plus, how an emoji became
*02:12.800- 02:22.520* :  broiled in the long running dispute over Jerusalem. It is not a new complaint from Ukraine,
*02:22.520- 02:28.400* :  but it is one that seems to be increasingly relevant as Russia steps up its attacks. Ukraine's
*02:28.400- 02:33.680* :  president, Vladimir Zelensky, says his army was unable to stop a Russian missile attack on the
*02:33.680- 02:38.500* :  northern city of Chenyiv because they didn't have enough military support from Western allies.
*02:39.140- 02:44.660* :  Officials say the assault killed at least 14 people with many more believed to be injured
*02:44.660- 02:49.420* :  and trapped under the rubble. Our correspondent in Kiev, James Waterhouse, has the latest.
*02:49.940- 02:57.180* :  We saw footage online of people running for cover in one case of a trolley bus where
*02:57.180- 03:01.860* :  there were loud explosions and columns of smoke going into the air. Now, according to authorities
*03:01.860- 03:07.940* :  in this northern Ukrainian city, which is 60 miles from the border with Russia, there were three
*03:07.940- 03:15.440* :  missiles which hit the center of the city. The authorities say an eight-story building was hit
*03:15.480- 03:21.820* :  in a residential area. And this is a fact of life, really, for people across this country,
*03:22.420- 03:28.440* :  where you see shattered windows, where you see human devastation in places that might not necessarily
*03:28.440- 03:35.500* :  be close to the front line. And when you're in a place like Chenyiv, I was last year in August
*03:35.500- 03:40.180* :  last year after the main city hall was hit by a missile where seven people were killed.
*03:41.020- 03:46.820* :  There is less of a time gap between air raid sirens going off and the moment of impact
*03:46.820- 03:51.420* :  because of its proximity to Russia. But what is interesting when you look at what
*03:51.420- 03:55.360* :  the local mayor is saying, if you look at what President Zelensky is saying, if you look at what
*03:55.360- 04:01.240* :  his foreign secretary is saying, is that they see this as a both a source of political frustration
*04:01.340- 04:05.580* :  but also opportunity. They are saying they're being explicit that if it wasn't for
*04:06.480- 04:11.040* :  Ukraine's western allies being more coordinated in its help for Ukraine, then it might have been
*04:11.040- 04:16.980* :  able to prevent this attack with well-supplied air defenses. There has been a real feeling of
*04:16.980- 04:24.980* :  frustration over the past few days when you look at Israel, another non-NATO country, you see how
*04:24.980- 04:30.760* :  its own allies rallied against a large-scale drone attack from Iran, which is what Ukraine
*04:30.760- 04:35.420* :  experiences all the time. But President Zelensky is saying, well, if allies can rally behind Israel,
*04:35.420- 04:40.020* :  why can't they do the same for us? And it's a continuation of this messaging we're
*04:40.020- 04:45.700* :  certainly getting here in Kiev. James Waterhouse in the Ukrainian capital. Well, in recent months,
*04:45.700- 04:51.500* :  Russia has made small games on the front line in the east of Ukraine. But those advances have
*04:51.500- 04:56.940* :  come at a huge cost. A BBC investigation has found that more Russian soldiers died in the second
*04:56.940- 05:01.500* :  year of the war than the first 12 months when the front lines were much more fluid.
*05:02.120- 05:07.840* :  BBC News Russian and the independent Russian media outlet MediaZona have confirmed the deaths of
*05:07.840- 05:13.060* :  more than 50,000 Russians during the war in Ukraine, using data from military graveyards,
*05:13.060- 05:18.940* :  official reports, and social media. Olga Ivshina from the BBC Russian service told me more about
*05:18.940- 05:25.300* :  their findings. Most importantly, as you rightly said, we have confirmed 50,000 Russians killed
*05:25.300- 05:30.620* :  fighting in Ukraine. This is not the total amount of the casualties, but this sets up a bare minimum
*05:30.620- 05:35.160* :  of Russian losses. We have done that using open source information only, so it's not only
*05:35.160- 05:41.040* :  casualties, it's deaths only, which is important. Secondly, thousands of these stories put together
*05:41.040- 05:46.280* :  help us understand not only the scale of losses, but the main trends. And the most important trend
*05:46.300- 05:53.240* :  is that Russia has lost 23% more troops in the second 12 months of fighting compared to the first
*05:53.240- 05:58.420* :  year of the invasion. And that's very important, because it reflects the change of tactics. It seems
*05:58.420- 06:03.620* :  during the first year they were relying on their professional soldiers deployed to carry out
*06:03.620- 06:10.680* :  quite complex tactical operations, but now, once all those soldiers were mostly killed or injured,
*06:10.680- 06:15.600* :  they have to deal with the significant numbers of inexperienced troops, and they send them to
*06:15.600- 06:21.400* :  what soldiers called themselves a mid-grinder. And how effective is this sort of a traditional
*06:21.400- 06:26.340* :  warfare? That's exactly the question I was interested in as well. That's why I asked to comment
*06:26.340- 06:31.320* :  on that. Defence analyst Samuel Cranny Evans from the Royal United Services Institute,
*06:31.320- 06:36.380* :  military think tank. The Russians are now able to bring a lot more firepower to bear against
*06:36.380- 06:42.960* :  Ukrainian positions when they go into the offensive. As long as the Ukrainians are unable to shift
*06:43.020- 06:49.940* :  that balance of firepower, the meat grinder tactics will very likely continue to be quite successful
*06:49.940- 06:56.760* :  in taking limited areas of ground across the front. I think it's also very important to add that
*06:57.300- 07:02.500* :  the key component of that tactics and of that fighting force were prisoners. It made
*07:02.500- 07:08.480* :  recruited and sent to the front line from Russian prisoners. Yeah, this was a tactic champion
*07:08.480- 07:14.640* :  by the Wagner group. Wagner's no longer there. How has that changed the situation? Actually,
*07:14.640- 07:20.200* :  in a way it did and didn't because as soon as Wagner stopped its recruitment in prison's
*07:20.200- 07:25.460* :  Russian Ministry of Defence picked it up. So now they are in charge of recruiting prisoners,
*07:25.900- 07:31.220* :  allegedly training them and sending them to the front line. But what we have seen is that
*07:31.220- 07:37.760* :  actually, first of all, in our sample, half of the prisoners died within first three months
*07:37.760- 07:43.760* :  on the front line. And secondly, prisoners recruited by M.O.D. are dying even faster than those
*07:43.760- 07:49.040* :  recruited by Wagner. And once again, I ask Defence Analyst Samuel Cranny Evans to comment on that,
*07:49.040- 07:54.180* :  to explain why this is happening and what it means. The prisoners would be sent first onto the
*07:54.180- 07:59.340* :  Ukrainian positions and that would force Ukrainians to reveal themselves and engage them possibly
*07:59.340- 08:04.400* :  with artillery. The real units would then be able to conduct their own offensives against
*08:04.400- 08:11.140* :  already pre-weakened Ukrainian positions. Samuel Cranny Evans of the Royal United Services Institute.
*08:11.140- 08:17.940* :  Now, like Ukraine, Russia doesn't like talking about its losses. Have they made any response to this?
*08:18.480- 08:23.080* :  We have requested for a comment, but there was no response so far. And also we have done it a few
*08:23.080- 08:27.620* :  times over the past two years. There has been no response. I think it's very important to
*08:27.620- 08:32.940* :  underline that all countries are secretive about the losses during the active combat. However,
*08:32.940- 08:39.520* :  we have seen that Russia is concealing his losses years and even decades after wars are over.
*08:39.980- 08:46.040* :  Olga Ivshina of the BBC Russian Service. Inequality over access to health care is literally
*08:46.040- 08:51.520* :  killing women. That is the stark conclusion of the UN's annual report into the state of the world
*08:51.520- 08:58.420* :  population. It says that across the US, Canada and Latin America, women of African descent are
*08:58.420- 09:04.560* :  three times more likely to die than white women when giving birth. While those in Africa itself
*09:04.620- 09:10.900* :  are at much greater danger than elsewhere, Dr. Natalia Kahnem is head of the UN Population Fund.
*09:11.560- 09:18.080* :  Women of African descent experience higher rates of mistreatment and neglect by health providers.
*09:19.200- 09:25.500* :  Indigenous women are routinely denied culturally appropriate maternal health care.
*09:26.340- 09:32.000* :  As a result, these groups are much more likely and in some places it's six times more likely
*09:32.000- 09:37.940* :  to die during pregnancy or childbirth. For more on what the report shows, I spoke to
*09:37.940- 09:43.480* :  our Geneva correspondent, Imogen folks. It's a bit of a sad picture of stark inequalities.
*09:43.480- 09:52.000* :  If we look, for example, at maternal mortality, a woman in Africa is 130 times more likely to die
*09:52.000- 09:58.720* :  from complications in pregnancy and childbirth than a woman in Europe or North America.
*09:59.380- 10:04.200* :  Or if you look at, for example, marginalized communities in eastern and central Europe,
*10:04.200- 10:10.620* :  the Roma community, for example, women there have a much more difficult time accessing the
*10:10.620- 10:17.680* :  healthcare and support they need. But in wealthy countries too, so a stark picture of inequality,
*10:17.680- 10:23.580* :  which we often comfort ourselves as saying we're actually doing a lot about, but not in this case.
*10:23.960- 10:28.720* :  Yeah, why has progress in this area slowed? Because things were getting better.
*10:29.400- 10:35.060* :  Well, they were and you know, we had that that moment of great optimism 30 odd years ago
*10:35.060- 10:41.820* :  with the end of the Cold War when we got together for a summit on women and population.
*10:42.040- 10:48.740* :  And they are following that. We saw real progress on better access to health issues,
*10:49.580- 10:54.660* :  specifically for women reproductive rights and so on, care in pregnancy and childbirth.
*10:55.380- 11:03.520* :  But for the last at least 8 to 10 years, that progress is stalled with 800 women a day dying
*11:03.520- 11:10.680* :  in childbirth in 2016 and that figure is the same today. I think the underlying picture is that
*11:10.680- 11:16.820* :  we are, as we see in other areas, we're not addressing inequality. The gap between rich and poor
*11:16.820- 11:24.840* :  is rising and this obviously impacts women too. And there's also a warning about politicians
*11:24.860- 11:31.780* :  who the reports says use women's bodies as a battleground. I guess referring to what the US
*11:31.780- 11:39.360* :  election? In part, there are other areas too. We have, for example, if you look at the Gambia,
*11:39.360- 11:46.860* :  this discussion about a relegalizing female genital mutilation. But indeed in the United States,
*11:47.680- 11:56.520* :  the access to abortion is clearly being limited, at least in some parts of the US. And this is
*11:56.540- 12:04.040* :  tied again into the root cause that we were talking about is that women's rights, equal rights
*12:04.880- 12:11.400* :  are not being promoted in the way that the UN population found who wrote this report would like.
*12:12.020- 12:16.880* :  They don't take a stance on particular political strategies in different countries.
*12:16.880- 12:25.140* :  But they do point to glaring inequalities in women's access to health and this very concerning
*12:25.180- 12:30.160* :  statistic that, you know, progress has stalled over the last decade.
*12:30.700- 12:36.340* :  Geneva correspondent image in folks. In recent months, hundreds of soldiers from Myanmar have fled
*12:36.340- 12:42.460* :  to Bangladesh as fighting intensifies between the Burmese military and rebels. Officials in
*12:42.460- 12:47.220* :  Bangladesh say dozens more have arrived there today. This loss of soldiers through
*12:47.220- 12:52.640* :  desertion as well as injury has left the army in Myanmar short of recruits. So the military
*12:52.640- 12:58.660* :  junta there has imposed a national conscription law, meaning males between the ages of 18 and 35
*12:58.660- 13:04.080* :  can now be called up to fight. Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head has been to meet
*13:04.080- 13:07.500* :  some of those who are now hiding in Thailand to avoid the draft.
*13:12.460- 13:17.540* :  With a barrage of gunfire, fighters from a volunteer people's defence force overrun an army base
*13:17.560- 13:22.240* :  along Myanmar's border with Thailand, yelling at the bewildered soldiers to surrender.
*13:22.620- 13:28.540* :  This was one of multiple attacks last week which inflicted another humiliating defeat on the
*13:28.540- 13:33.860* :  Myanmar military. By the end of the week, it had lost control of Ngarwadi, the border crossing
*13:33.860- 13:41.420* :  through which most trade with Thailand passes. It's quiet now over on the Thai side, but armed
*13:41.420- 13:46.200* :  soldiers are visible everywhere, patrolling the banks of the narrow river which divides the two
*13:46.200- 13:51.520* :  countries. Tens of thousands have come here to the town of Mesoth since the coup in Myanmar,
*13:52.120- 14:02.300* :  many in just the past few weeks. So I've just walked into a large shophouse in the market here in
*14:02.300- 14:08.800* :  the centre of Mesoth and inside, this is an empty shophouse, they've subdivided it with
*14:09.260- 14:14.700* :  bits of plywood and black tarpoline and there are families living in all of these different
*14:14.700- 14:21.280* :  cubicles who fled across the border from Myanmar side because of the fighting there.
*14:22.340- 14:23.640* :  They're too frightened to go back.
*14:31.920- 14:37.100* :  But in a sugarcane field outside the town, I found a group of young men living under a leaf fat
*14:37.100- 14:42.020* :  shelter who hadn't fled the fighting. They run away from the new conscription law.
*14:42.020- 14:49.360* :  So how old are you, Sanjay? 23 years old. 23. The dangerous age in Myanmar now. Sanjay,
*14:49.360- 14:55.380* :  not his real name, arrived in Mesoth three weeks ago. He says he opposed the coup but never thought
*14:55.380- 15:01.480* :  of leaving Myanmar until he heard he was being called up. The idea of fighting for the hunter
*15:01.480- 15:04.480* :  horrified his family and they sent him to the border.
*15:09.360- 15:13.820* :  Beckham, I felt afraid every day that they would come to take me into the army.
*15:14.720- 15:20.020* :  Even though we have very little food here, just rice and vegetables, no one would come to
*15:20.020- 15:26.660* :  harm me. I feel free here in Thailand. Mesoth is now a warrior of safe houses,
*15:26.660- 15:32.580* :  sheltering fugitives from war, chaos and conscription. So when did you come to Mesoth?
*15:36.140- 15:43.200* :  One week. I met a family of five who arrived just a week ago after a harrowing 15 day journey
*15:43.200- 15:50.060* :  from Yangon. They have few possessions and little money. They fled because their 19-year-old
*15:50.060- 15:58.340* :  had got his call-up papers. I could not let my son be forced to fight other young men,
*15:58.340- 16:04.660* :  said his father. Many like Sanjay dream of joining the armed struggle against the military,
*16:05.420- 16:11.660* :  but few of them are up to the grueling demands of jungle warfare and life in Mesoth can be hard
*16:12.180- 16:15.400* :  with no status or documents in titling them to live in Thailand.
*16:16.340- 16:21.360* :  Nature when runs a community center called Joy House, which tries to help with the trauma and
*16:21.360- 16:26.860* :  depression often experienced by Burmese refugees. They are someone proficient in like
*16:26.860- 16:32.260* :  ethics or engineer or daughter or they are someone before them, a literary coup, but when they
*16:32.260- 16:37.700* :  cross the border they become state-legs. Their education is stopped, they cannot support their
*16:37.700- 16:43.780* :  family, they cannot support them, says there is no job for them, so they are started thinking
*16:43.780- 16:48.480* :  I'm useless. Nature when ending that report from Thailand by Jonathan Head.
*16:49.440- 16:53.740* :  The works of William Shakespeare are often hailed as some of the greatest ever written,
*16:54.340- 16:59.300* :  but are they still relevant to young people today? Well, a new limited edition of Shakespeare's
*16:59.300- 17:04.740* :  first folio has been specially created for children by Shakespeare's birthplace trust.
*17:05.400- 17:10.560* :  Michael Rosen, author of more than 200 books, including What's So Special about Shakespeare,
*17:11.280- 17:15.280* :  has been commissioned to write a poem for the opening of the book. He spoke to Martha Karney.
*17:15.900- 17:21.780* :  To the reader, to read or not to read this book, it's in your hands, so take a look, the plays by
*17:21.780- 17:27.180* :  gentle Shakespeare here, with pictures through each play appear for you and friends to laugh,
*17:27.180- 17:33.940* :  to cry, to sink in thought, to wonder why. For you will find on every page the lives of us
*17:34.280- 17:40.280* :  in every age, and though the folios are fact, our aims to give you plays to act.
*17:41.500- 17:46.400* :  Plays to act, and that's one of the big ambitions, isn't it, that this book will inspire a lot more
*17:46.400- 17:51.580* :  performances by children of Shakespeare? Yes, that's right. I mean, the whole of the plays that
*17:52.040- 17:56.900* :  are in Shakespeare's first folio have been abridged wonderfully by Dr. Anson, a two-hand,
*17:57.420- 18:02.340* :  and the aim is that these are, well, some of them four pages, five pages that are absolutely
*18:02.340- 18:08.140* :  perfect for groups of children to act either in school or out of school. They're there for
*18:08.140- 18:13.120* :  that purpose, yes. And would you say it's the case that Shakespeare isn't being performed as much
*18:13.120- 18:18.320* :  as it used to be in schools? It's been difficult to say. I find my experience with my own children,
*18:18.340- 18:22.880* :  is that though they did Shakespeare in primary schools and acted out bits, the moment they
*18:22.880- 18:28.880* :  hit secondary schools, somehow rather it becomes the Shakespeare on the page, on the table, with heads
*18:28.880- 18:34.560* :  down reading it, which is... Well, I always think Shakespeare wrote play scripts, and that's what he
*18:34.560- 18:40.460* :  wrote. All the plays were meant to be immediately performed, and somehow, if you just put
*18:40.460- 18:45.900* :  bow your head over them and don't perform, if it's only just bits of it, then you're somehow
*18:45.900- 18:51.460* :  rather taking away from what they were actually written for. And so you think there will be more
*18:51.460- 18:57.000* :  pleasure for children if they're able to do that? I do, I do. If you just think, if you take one
*18:57.000- 19:02.260* :  scene, for example, is the scene I've come to, which is the moment when Juliet's father is saying,
*19:02.260- 19:05.880* :  look, I've got this lovely guy, he's absolutely wonderful, well-proportioned in every way,
*19:06.240- 19:09.800* :  this chap Paris, and you can marry him. And we as an audience watch it, and we go,
*19:10.020- 19:15.060* :  ah, no, Juliet, she's already married, they've just been in bed together, Romeo and Juliet
*19:15.060- 19:19.840* :  being in bed together. What are you doing? And then when Juliet says, well, and she hesitates,
*19:19.860- 19:26.020* :  and he goes crazy, this is a fantastic dramatic moment. There's no point in just sitting pouring
*19:26.020- 19:31.980* :  over it with your head over it, you want to act it out, feel the passion and the irony going on.
*19:32.680- 19:36.900* :  And is the new book, is it based on Shakespeare's own words, or is it a version of Shakespeare?
*19:36.900- 19:43.700* :  Yes, it is, that's right. The way Dr. Anson and Juhann has done it is that she's digested it,
*19:43.700- 19:48.040* :  if you write, abridged it, but these are Shakespeare's words, one or two tweaks, which you're
*19:48.040- 19:51.920* :  explained in the introduction, but these are Shakespeare's words, so you really are. If you want
*19:51.920- 19:55.560* :  full frath and five, it's there. This island's mine, I'm thinking, the tempest, you know,
*19:55.980- 20:00.240* :  they're here. These words are here. Michael Rosen talking to Martha Carney.
*20:03.260- 20:08.340* :  And still to come on the global news podcast. Somebody refused to take a check from me because it
*20:08.340- 20:13.160* :  only had my name. It was a furniture vendor for my office, and he said, oh, there's only a lady's
*20:13.160- 20:18.800* :  name in it. Are you sure? You don't have a man who can co-sign it. In the run up to elections
*20:18.900- 20:22.500* :  in India, we hear from women about the challenges they still face.
*20:48.980- 20:53.260* :  Every step of the way, because we know that nothing is more important than delivering a smile.

*21:01.080- 21:05.880* :  You've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right? Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather,
*21:05.900- 21:12.020* :  and there was a time when he was the biggest star in all the world. But something happened,
*21:12.140- 21:17.900* :  not just to him, but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave,
*21:18.060- 21:26.120* :  forced out. All episodes of Hollywood Exiles from the BBC World Service and CBC are available now.
*21:26.860- 21:29.780* :  Search for Hollywood Exiles wherever you get your podcasts.
*21:37.160- 21:42.940* :  Iran's large-scale drone and missile attack on Israel at the weekend may largely have failed,
*21:43.600- 21:48.500* :  with most of the projectiles shot down. But the Israeli government has warned of a tough response.
*21:49.300- 21:54.420* :  The US and the other nations which helped Israel defend itself are keen to avoid that response
*21:54.420- 22:00.060* :  triggering a wider regional war. The British and German foreign ministers are in Jerusalem
*22:00.060- 22:05.240* :  for talks with Israel's leaders. They were also expected to discuss the continuing humanitarian
*22:05.240- 22:11.500* :  crisis in Gaza. The UN has announced it's launching a $2.8 billion appeal to provide aid
*22:11.500- 22:17.280* :  to the Palestinian population there, as well as the occupied West Bank. So what can we expect
*22:17.280- 22:21.680* :  to come out of these talks? Our Middle East correspondent, Yolanda Nell, is in Jerusalem.
*22:22.220- 22:29.240* :  This is just the latest, in terms of international pressures, world leaders talking to Israeli leaders,
*22:29.660- 22:35.320* :  trying to reiterate both the kind of steadfast support for Israel's security. That's what we
*22:35.320- 22:40.080* :  told that Rishisunak, the British Prime Minister, spoke to the Israeli Prime Minister about
*22:40.600- 22:45.000* :  last night. But at the same time, stressing this need for stability in the region,
*22:45.500- 22:51.060* :  saying that greater escalation is in no one's interest and will only deepen insecurity
*22:51.060- 22:56.360* :  in the Middle East. That's what Rishisunak said. It's going to be re-emphasized, I think, by
*22:56.360- 23:02.680* :  Lord Cameron in his trip here. He said it's very concerning that the situation right now,
*23:02.680- 23:08.400* :  when he was asked if we're on the brink of a full-scale regional war, but he's also trying here
*23:08.400- 23:14.580* :  to kind of walk a delicate diplomatic line, you know, calling for restraint, but also acknowledging
*23:14.620- 23:21.920* :  that a ally has had an unprecedented direct attack on its own territory. So he's also going to be
*23:22.380- 23:27.440* :  trying to steer things back, I think, towards talking about Gaza and putting more pressure on
*23:27.440- 23:31.980* :  Israel once again, which is what he's been doing consistently to allow humanitarian aid in
*23:32.380- 23:37.720* :  without wanting to appear too hectoring, but he's also talking about the need here for Hamas to
*23:37.720- 23:43.720* :  release hostages and the importance of Western powers imposing more sanctions on Iran.
*23:44.160- 23:51.460* :  You mentioned Gaza, this $2.8 billion appeal coming from the UN. What would that money
*23:52.220- 23:57.960* :  go towards and will it actually be able to be raised? Yeah, so the UN said that actually
*23:57.960- 24:03.080* :  its humanitarian office actually wanted to go for a bigger sum initially, $4 billion,
*24:03.260- 24:09.220* :  but it actually reduced the target due to the difficulty right now of getting aid to
*24:09.220- 24:16.840* :  garsers. Most of this money is to go to Gaza a little also for the West Bank, and the head of the
*24:17.000- 24:23.100* :  UN's humanitarian office was briefing journalists talking about the disruptions to aid getting in.
*24:23.480- 24:27.860* :  Of course, Israel and Washington have been saying that aid flows have really risen significantly
*24:27.860- 24:33.640* :  in recent days, but the UN agencies are saying it still doesn't meet minimum levels,
*24:33.640- 24:38.120* :  and they say that often when there are new openings, they take us few steps forward,
*24:38.120- 24:41.820* :  but then they have to take some back and they left in the same point. They're really still
*24:41.820- 24:46.100* :  getting a lot of difficulties getting aid in. Yolanda now, and since we spoke to Yolanda,
*24:46.100- 24:51.060* :  the Israeli Prime Minister has issued a statement thanking the foreign ministers of Germany and
*24:51.060- 24:56.400* :  Britain for their support, but saying Israel will reach its own decisions on its security.
*24:56.880- 25:02.460* :  If there's something you'd like to know about the Iran-Israel crisis, then please do get in touch.
*25:02.460- 25:06.380* :  We're doing another one of our Q&A specials here on the Global News Podcast,
*25:06.380- 25:11.160* :  so if you'd like us to put your question to BBC Experts and Correspondents in the region,

*25:22.740- 25:28.960* :  Voting for the Indian elections begins on Friday, with almost a billion people eligible to take part.
*25:29.620- 25:33.280* :  For decades, the number of women turning out to vote in India has been low,
*25:33.280- 25:38.840* :  but that has changed over the past 10 years. For the first time, nearly half of voters,
*25:38.840- 25:45.420* :  more than 470 million people, are women, so the parties are deliberately targeting policies
*25:45.420- 25:50.600* :  at women to try to win them over. Divina Gupta has been talking to some of the women in the capital,
*25:51.020- 25:51.040* :  Delhi.
*25:52.580- 25:53.080* :  Namaste.
*25:57.940- 26:01.780* :  This is the home of 69-year-old professor, Dr Manaswini Yogi.
*26:02.520- 26:06.400* :  She's recently retired from India's prestigious Delhi University.
*26:07.520- 26:12.580* :  This home represents basic comforts of middle-class India, running tap water,
*26:12.980- 26:17.120* :  a big kitchen with gas stove to cook food and clean toilets.
*26:17.780- 26:22.020* :  This tea with spicy Indian snacks on the table, and we have two other guests.
*26:22.680- 26:27.200* :  Angel Jaiswal is dressed in blue jeans and shirt and has just turned 18.
*26:27.880- 26:30.120* :  She's looking forward to the upcoming elections.
*26:30.440- 26:32.280* :  How do you feel being amongst all these?
*26:33.620- 26:34.820* :  I'm relief.
*26:34.820- 26:40.260* :  And 27-year-old Uppas Nadash, who is in a formal suit and is an entrepreneur,
*26:40.580- 26:42.700* :  heading charge aboard brand consultancy.
*26:43.600- 26:46.500* :  I feel very connected, I feel like, in what my vote matters.
*26:47.320- 26:52.820* :  My guest speaks English, which is another sign of a comfortable, aspiring middle-class in India.
*26:53.260- 26:56.500* :  So when they go to cast their vote, what is on their wish list?
*26:56.920- 26:59.040* :  Angel Jaiswal starts the conversation.
*26:59.500- 27:04.000* :  Like, as a student, the main issue is, obviously, a job issue.
*27:04.520- 27:07.100* :  Like, in future, right now, AI is developing.
*27:07.100- 27:12.820* :  So what government will do for the people and what jobs will be offered?
*27:13.040- 27:14.440* :  Professor, you have seen this.
*27:14.860- 27:22.080* :  That the younger generation now is taking their duty to vote differently than perhaps your generation.
*27:22.660- 27:22.840* :  Yes.
*27:23.200- 27:25.140* :  The first time I voted, I was 21.
*27:25.140- 27:28.020* :  But even then, people were lazy.
*27:28.020- 27:29.520* :  They didn't want to go out and vote.
*27:29.520- 27:33.860* :  They didn't feel that it is their duty to bring the right people in the center
*27:34.320- 27:36.220* :  so that the country can progress.
*27:36.840- 27:38.920* :  That thing was not there in people's mind.
*27:38.920- 27:44.000* :  Right, but today, because of so much competition between parties, what they're offering,
*27:44.520- 27:46.320* :  everybody thinks on those lines.
*27:46.480- 27:49.260* :  Interesting that you say this, because Angel is referring to jobs.
*27:49.300- 27:49.760* :  Yeah.
*27:50.000- 27:54.580* :  Pasta, you as an entrepreneur are part of that cycle that can provide jobs.
*27:54.580- 27:57.540* :  But do you see yourself being part of a solution?
*27:57.540- 28:02.380* :  There are challenges that you also face and you want things differently from this election onwards.
*28:02.560- 28:06.500* :  So, you know, the good thing is, Angel and me, we both want the same thing.
*28:06.960- 28:07.980* :  We want more jobs.
*28:07.980- 28:09.580* :  We want to do business.
*28:09.580- 28:13.460* :  So, you know, me and more people like me are part of the solution.
*28:13.460- 28:16.740* :  But we need more support to provide those solutions at scale.
*28:17.080- 28:18.580* :  But you know, the challenge is still today.
*28:18.580- 28:21.740* :  I can sit here and, you know, I can have this really empowered conversation with you
*28:21.740- 28:22.900* :  in a very empowered home.
*28:22.900- 28:27.040* :  But up until a couple of weeks ago, you know, somebody refused to take a check from me
*28:27.040- 28:28.460* :  because it only had my name.
*28:28.980- 28:31.900* :  And it was a furniture vendor for my office and he said,
*28:32.260- 28:33.780* :  Oh, there's only a lady's name in it.
*28:33.780- 28:34.440* :  Are you sure?
*28:34.540- 28:37.620* :  You don't have a man who can co-sign it.
*28:38.200- 28:39.900* :  Sometimes you become immune to it.
*28:39.900- 28:43.620* :  You know, I'm like, yeah, I, you know, now I'll make a joke about it.
*28:43.620- 28:44.900* :  That yes, my check will work.
*28:45.060- 28:45.800* :  Please believe me.
*28:46.260- 28:50.520* :  But I think the problem still remains that, you know, I'm here with my colleague
*28:50.520- 28:55.220* :  and we have to calculate getting out of this interview and going back in time
*28:55.220- 28:56.940* :  so that we reach home safely.
*28:57.500- 28:59.620* :  I still have to calculate my pitch meetings.
*28:59.620- 29:01.380* :  I can't do a pitch meeting in the night
*29:01.380- 29:04.620* :  because I am sometimes scared of crossing certain parts of the city.
*29:05.100- 29:09.020* :  In fact, we progress quite well on the policy and the support side.
*29:09.020- 29:11.720* :  But the base level on-ground problem still remains.
*29:12.200- 29:15.580* :  A passionate ash talking to Davina Gupta in Delhi.
*29:16.360- 29:19.680* :  It is 100 days until the Olympic Games begin in Paris,
*29:19.680- 29:22.840* :  but preparations have come under scrutiny from rights groups.
*29:22.840- 29:26.360* :  After police removed hundreds of homeless migrants from a squat,
*29:26.800- 29:28.020* :  thought to be the biggest in France.
*29:28.020- 29:31.160* :  freelance journalist Lisa Louie is in the French capital.
*29:31.560- 29:35.140* :  This morning, right, please moved in and they evacuated
*29:35.140- 29:38.540* :  hundreds of migrants who, according to eight associations,
*29:39.040- 29:43.300* :  were mostly legal migrants who had been living there and working
*29:43.880- 29:45.980* :  across the Elephonse Paris region.
*29:46.420- 29:47.520* :  And they moved them elsewhere.
*29:47.520- 29:50.300* :  We don't know yet where to generally speaking.
*29:50.660- 29:55.460* :  The authorities tend to bring at least some of those they evacuated
*29:55.460- 30:00.200* :  during such actions to reception centres a bit further away from Paris.
*30:00.220- 30:05.440* :  There have been some stories about evacuations ahead of the Olympic Games
*30:05.440- 30:08.660* :  that will start in late July here in Paris.
*30:08.700- 30:12.640* :  And eight associations have been alleging that the authorities were trying
*30:12.640- 30:16.340* :  to get people out of the city centre, out of areas
*30:16.340- 30:21.000* :  where the games will be happening or where people will be staying.
*30:21.420- 30:23.600* :  In this area, this morning in Vithisosen,
*30:23.600- 30:27.800* :  which is the south of Paris, some delegations will say there will be no
*30:27.800- 30:31.200* :  competitions there, but for example, the Japanese breakdowns team,
*30:31.580- 30:32.440* :  they will stay there.
*30:32.760- 30:34.040* :  However, the government is applying.
*30:34.040- 30:36.040* :  No, this is just what we always do.
*30:36.380- 30:39.820* :  And we provide temporary shelter or even permanent shelter.
*30:39.820- 30:42.560* :  We want to bring people to safety actually.
*30:42.560- 30:44.100* :  And this is just what we always do.
*30:44.440- 30:48.740* :  However, the authorities admit that there are certain areas in Paris
*30:49.260- 30:52.340* :  where people, homeless people, can't stay doing the games
*30:52.340- 30:57.220* :  one of these areas is, for example, right next to the lawn in front of the Ambalid,
*30:57.600- 31:01.400* :  you know, the museum there, because there you will have the archery competition
*31:01.520- 31:05.260* :  and there will be a temporary stadium that will be built there
*31:05.260- 31:07.180* :  so people can't stay and sleep rough there.
*31:07.620- 31:09.040* :  Lisa Louis in Paris.
*31:10.000- 31:13.940* :  Now, whether it is in text messages, WhatsApp groups or other social media,
*31:14.380- 31:18.040* :  it can be hard to avoid emojis with a variety of faces,
*31:18.040- 31:20.160* :  hand gestures, animals and even food.
*31:20.160- 31:23.100* :  It seems there is one for almost every kind of occasion,
*31:23.400- 31:27.120* :  but rarely do they stir up the kind of controversy we can hear about now
*31:27.120- 31:28.820* :  in this report from Alfie Habershon.
*31:29.160- 31:32.600* :  The best thing about phones is they just make life a bit easier,
*31:33.220- 31:35.600* :  especially when it comes to getting your point across.
*31:36.320- 31:38.460* :  You might be texting that friend happy birthday or
*31:38.460- 31:40.780* :  giving them a rundown of what you've been eating.
*31:41.380- 31:45.640* :  And before you've even finished typing, the right emoji simply flashes up before you.
*31:46.280- 31:49.620* :  And often we didn't realise that a small picture of a monkey
*31:49.620- 31:52.620* :  or a salsa dancer was what our message really needed.
*31:53.500- 31:57.440* :  Of course, some do find it a bit cringy, but it does tend to lift the mood.
*31:58.280- 32:03.260* :  Well, that's except for one case, which is left users so divided that Apple
*32:03.280- 32:06.280* :  has decided to remodify its emoji software.
*32:07.160- 32:09.500* :  That's because after a new update last week,
