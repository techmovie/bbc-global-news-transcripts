*01:47.040- 01:51.840* :  Knowing that I've played a part in helping her just lead a normal life, that's an
*01:51.880- 01:52.380* :  awesome thing.
*01:52.680- 01:55.100* :  How TikTok is teaching Oliver to read.
*01:55.400- 01:58.320* :  I'm saying in my car right now, I never learned to read, but at the end, they're like,
*01:58.320- 02:01.860* :  I just picked up a book with a library and I'm like, hey, since you went, I'm gonna go
*02:01.880- 02:02.160* :  today.
*02:02.480- 02:05.040* :  A holiday with a difference for Pam from Newfoundland.
*02:05.440- 02:09.860* :  While we're not back in the days when we're, you know, chopping our wood and lugging the
*02:09.860- 02:14.220* :  water, the weather is still a real big drag here in Newfoundland.
*02:14.660- 02:14.900* :  And?
*02:16.460- 02:23.240* :  Europe's best seagull impersonator, a nine-year-old, called Cooper.
*02:28.580- 02:33.100* :  We begin at one of New York's famous and glamorous landmarks, the Plaza Hotel.
*02:41.900- 02:45.800* :  That was the moment that scores of ballerinas took on the Guinness World record.
*02:45.800- 02:50.500* :  And for the largest number of dancers to be on point, balanced on the tips of their toes
*02:50.920- 02:52.920* :  for a whole minute at the same time.
*02:53.380- 02:57.860* :  Not easy, especially as they didn't have enough dancers to do it until the very last
*02:57.880- 02:58.360* :  moment.
*02:59.000- 03:03.400* :  I spoke to one of the organizers, Sergei Gordello, from the renowned ballet program, Youth
*03:03.400- 03:08.220* :  America Grand Prix, who was in New York, as well as 16-year-old dancer Sally Caruso,
*03:08.220- 03:10.820* :  who was at home in Orange County, California.
*03:11.320- 03:15.520* :  Three hundred and fifty-three ballerinas from all around the globe gathered there.
*03:15.680- 03:18.000* :  And it was really something truly epic.
*03:18.140- 03:21.540* :  Yes, it was so exciting, it was such a beautiful atmosphere.
*03:22.040- 03:26.360* :  Everyone was wearing white tutus, white leotard with this beautiful warm light.
*03:26.360- 03:31.100* :  And it was really truly magical and something that I will definitely remember for the rest
*03:31.120- 03:31.820* :  of my life.
*03:32.120- 03:33.280* :  Take me into this room, then.
*03:33.280- 03:38.420* :  There are three hundred and fifty-three ballerinas from all over the world about to break
*03:38.420- 03:39.740* :  a Guinness World record.
*03:40.280- 03:41.420* :  What does that look like?
*03:42.380- 03:42.900* :  Pure chaos.
*03:42.900- 03:50.600* :  You know, and I laugh because, gosh, you know, life is beautiful, you know, and it's unpredictable.
*03:50.940- 03:57.940* :  We have two thousand plus ballerinas, and we knew that the room could only hold maximum
*03:57.940- 03:59.660* :  of four hundred and fifty dancers.
*04:00.120- 04:02.000* :  And we put out a call to our finalists.
*04:02.000- 04:04.040* :  We said, okay, there is this opportunity and it should be in the room.
*04:04.040- 04:08.620* :  You know, why don't you come and be a part of it, but we knew the capacity was four hundred
*04:08.620- 04:09.020* :  and fifty.
*04:09.180- 04:11.220* :  And we cut it off at four hundred and fifty.
*04:11.740- 04:13.780* :  Then time to break the record.
*04:13.780- 04:18.260* :  The entire world is there, you know, the New York Times, the Associated Press, all the
*04:18.260- 04:21.600* :  television stations, the world's eyes are on us.
*04:21.660- 04:22.960* :  So we're here to break the record.
*04:22.960- 04:23.480* :  We're so happy.
*04:23.940- 04:26.040* :  Well, two hundred ballerinas show up.
*04:26.660- 04:28.460* :  We're like, what's going on?
*04:28.460- 04:31.700* :  So, you know, if we succeed, the world's eyes are on us.
*04:31.720- 04:34.220* :  If we fail, the world's eyes are on us.
*04:34.360- 04:35.400* :  And some dancers were late.
*04:35.400- 04:36.760* :  Some dancers couldn't find the plaza.
*04:37.080- 04:40.140* :  Some dancers, they were just saving their energy in this side of the last moment, not
*04:40.140- 04:40.660* :  to show up.
*04:41.060- 04:44.000* :  The long story short, the previous record was 306.
*04:44.560- 04:48.120* :  And so we're two hundred something dancers were missing a hundred dancers to meet the
*04:48.120- 04:48.640* :  current record.
*04:49.120- 04:52.620* :  And so we put out this call on social media for whoever can come.
*04:53.100- 04:57.620* :  Our board members who used to dance, stuffed the point shoes with toilet paper to make
*04:57.620- 04:59.820* :  sure they fit and get on the point.
*05:00.200- 05:03.700* :  Ultimately, dancers showed up, but even board members, two of our board members,
*05:03.700- 05:06.300* :  were rate on point for one minute to make sure we do this.
*05:06.300- 05:10.220* :  So, three hundred and fifty three by the skin of our teeth, we beat that record.
*05:10.520- 05:12.880* :  Just describe to me, Sally, what on point means?
*05:13.620- 05:16.640* :  Being on point is something that you have to build up to.
*05:16.940- 05:20.980* :  You practice so much being on flat shoes and then once you hit a certain age, you get
*05:20.980- 05:21.760* :  to go on point.
*05:21.940- 05:24.340* :  How much of a challenge is it to be on point for a minute?
*05:24.840- 05:30.060* :  It's definitely a challenge with over 350 people in a room, but being on point, you need
*05:30.060- 05:34.220* :  to have strength and you need to be able to have those muscles in your feet to be on
*05:34.220- 05:34.600* :  point.
*05:35.000- 05:36.500* :  How did you know the record had been done?
*05:36.500- 05:38.720* :  Did someone blow a whistle or something to say the minute was done?
*05:39.060- 05:41.400* :  When the minute was done, everyone was screaming cheering.
*05:42.020- 05:42.440* :  One.
*05:48.560- 05:53.740* :  Such a happy environment, it was so exciting, something that I will definitely remember.
*05:55.600- 05:58.800* :  And Sergio, you sound like a serial record breaker when it comes to this.
*05:58.860- 06:03.220* :  So no doubt in a year's time, we'll be talking about you having done this with 450 dances
*06:03.220- 06:03.700* :  or something.
*06:04.180- 06:05.100* :  Look, it's a gimmick.
*06:05.100- 06:06.500* :  It's a happy thing to do.
*06:06.500- 06:11.320* :  It's not an obviously what Uth America Grand Prix does as an organization, but also it's
*06:11.320- 06:14.580* :  a family whose members are ages nine to 19, right?
*06:14.580- 06:16.020* :  It's the world's largest dance family.
*06:16.020- 06:18.960* :  It's not about just attracting attention to us.
*06:18.960- 06:24.100* :  It's also about giving the family members a chance to be together to celebrate.
*06:24.100- 06:26.520* :  You know, we should have more joy in our lives.
*06:27.000- 06:33.220* :  This is such a magical way for humans to communicate to each other about the human experience.
*06:33.620- 06:35.500* :  It heals us without us even knowing.
*06:35.620- 06:40.060* :  Those of us who can't do it struggle to imagine you're doing anything other in a dance
*06:40.060- 06:43.420* :  studio than trying not to look at full, you know, and trying not to get it wrong.
*06:43.420- 06:46.900* :  But if you're brilliant at it, of course, you can escape to a whole different world.
*06:47.540- 06:48.620* :  Yes, it's quite magical.
*06:48.620- 06:49.300* :  I love it.
*06:49.840- 06:52.760* :  And may I just add, I would like to offer a correction.
*06:53.020- 06:55.820* :  There are no people who can't do it.
*06:55.840- 06:57.560* :  There are people dancing in wheelchairs.
*06:57.560- 07:01.460* :  There's actually a dance company here in the United States, or people in the wheelchairs
*07:01.860- 07:02.200* :  dancing.
*07:02.640- 07:04.120* :  And if you can walk, you can dance.
*07:04.120- 07:05.440* :  If you can't walk, you can dance.
*07:05.440- 07:08.200* :  If you can move your eyes, you can dance with your eyes, right?
*07:08.200- 07:10.540* :  It's not just, oh, you have to be brilliant at it.
*07:11.460- 07:17.100* :  It's a way for you to express this glorious experience of living in a human body and
*07:17.920- 07:20.140* :  hearing music vibrations, right?
*07:20.140- 07:21.080* :  So what is dance?
*07:21.080- 07:22.580* :  Dance is movement to music.
*07:22.580- 07:26.620* :  So if you can hear music, and if you can react to music, then you can dance.
*07:26.980- 07:29.060* :  I have to take Sergei and Sally's word for it.
*07:29.540- 07:34.180* :  Five-year-old British girl, Destiny Ray, had spent a total of six months of her young
*07:34.180- 07:36.320* :  life hooked up to dialysis machines.
*07:37.020- 07:40.080* :  And the odds of her getting a new kidney were desperately low.
*07:40.620- 07:45.580* :  In the UK, the shortage of donor organs from ethnic minorities means black patients wait
*07:45.580- 07:50.240* :  on average ten months longer on the transport list for a new kidney than white patients.
*07:51.040- 07:56.740* :  Now, thanks to a chance encounter with a kind stranger in an online chat room, Destiny
*07:56.740- 07:58.980* :  Ray's search for a kidney is over.
*07:59.460- 08:03.300* :  This is part of a new scheme where those wanting to help others can give away an organ
*08:03.300- 08:06.480* :  while they're alive, usually one of their kidneys or part of a liver.
*08:07.100- 08:11.420* :  But if they're not a direct match for a person they want to help, they go into a pool so
*08:11.420- 08:12.480* :  others can benefit.
*08:12.920- 08:14.320* :  Harry Blight takes up the story.
*08:14.860- 08:19.860* :  When five-year-old Destiny Ray was just ten months old, her kidneys stopped working.
*08:19.980- 08:25.000* :  We had to begin dialysis treatment three times a week for five hours at a time.
*08:25.660- 08:27.020* :  This is her mum, Maria.
*08:27.280- 08:28.300* :  The pair scheme is amazing.
*08:28.300- 08:34.340* :  So basically it's a scheme that all other families are in whose donor doesn't match the
*08:34.380- 08:35.600* :  child that they want to donate to.
*08:36.000- 08:40.720* :  So for me instance, my donor, she's not a match for Destiny, unfortunately, but there's
*08:40.760- 08:44.160* :  other families who are in the same position, who their donors don't match.
*08:44.760- 08:46.040* :  So we're all going through a big pool.
*08:46.700- 08:49.940* :  The one happens to maybe every three months and they just literally do a cross-match.
*08:50.080- 08:54.840* :  Maria, speaking to the BBC before her daughter, received a successful transplant.
*08:55.660- 08:58.120* :  And this is exactly what happened for Destiny Ray.
*08:58.480- 09:02.620* :  Maria went online and found a chat room where she asked for some support.
*09:03.300- 09:08.360* :  On there she met Liffie, a woman who was willing to donate a kidney, but Liffie wasn't
*09:08.360- 09:11.980* :  a match for Destiny, so they approached the organ swap scheme.
*09:12.440- 09:16.560* :  After two attempts, they found a match and completed the circuit.
*09:17.120- 09:22.400* :  Perhaps only go ahead if every patient can be matched with a donor, so no one misses
*09:22.400- 09:22.820* :  out.
*09:23.280- 09:26.500* :  Maria spoke to the BBC again after the operation.
*09:26.880- 09:27.840* :  I am so relieved.
*09:27.840- 09:28.540* :  Oh my gosh.
*09:28.540- 09:32.540* :  It was literally, I felt like a lifetime was waiting for this situation to happen.
*09:32.540- 09:37.640* :  And when it finally happened, I was like, oh my gosh, it's so nervous, can imagine.
*09:38.060- 09:41.540* :  Going to an officer's dream with her, holding her, saying, it's what we waited for.
*09:41.540- 09:43.980* :  It should be like four years of dialysis.
*09:44.140- 09:45.960* :  It's just been so difficult.
*09:45.960- 09:50.400* :  So defining that we're here now and we're in isolation at the moment, but once we're out
*09:50.400- 09:52.000* :  of it, I feel like life can finally begin.
*09:52.180- 09:56.020* :  Destiny is recovering at home and getting used to life with her new kidney.
*09:56.460- 09:57.160* :  What's your kidney name?
*09:57.340- 09:57.600* :  A problem?
*09:57.900- 09:58.240* :  Cha-cha.
*09:58.900- 09:59.840* :  Yeah, it's a cool joke, JoJo.
*09:59.900- 10:01.880* :  JoJo's kidney.
*10:01.880- 10:05.540* :  Maria says she's never been able to take Destiny Ray on holiday, so the pair have big
*10:05.540- 10:07.540* :  plans for life going forward.
*10:08.060- 10:08.600* :  Where do you want her?
*10:08.600- 10:10.500* :  She wants to go to Disneyland?
*10:10.500- 10:11.800* :  That's her dream.
*10:11.800- 10:13.440* :  And I want to go to Disneyland.
*10:13.440- 10:14.760* :  Where do you want to go now, then?
*10:14.760- 10:15.240* :  Are you sure?
*10:15.540- 10:16.460* :  I'm at the car.
*10:16.560- 10:17.360* :  You want to go to the car?
*10:17.540- 10:17.800* :  OK.
*10:18.540- 10:22.800* :  Maria and Destiny Ray planning a holiday, now one of the joys of a holiday is getting away from
*10:22.800- 10:25.140* :  at all with close family or friends.
*10:25.140- 10:31.580* :  But would you fancy one with hundreds of people who live near you, at least 250 couples
*10:31.700- 10:38.020* :  from the small Canadian island of Newfoundland, coincidentally, booked the same Caribbean cruise.
*10:38.640- 10:41.340* :  That's around one in every thousand people who live there.
*10:41.680- 10:43.500* :  Pam Paddy was one of those on board.
*10:44.040- 10:49.380* :  We started to find out that there were other Newfoundlanders on their property about December.
*10:49.380- 10:52.160* :  We started to see posts from friends.
*10:52.800- 10:58.680* :  At first, I was kind of like, oh, God, that's going to be horrible, and my partner is
*10:58.960- 10:59.680* :  all about it.
*10:59.680- 11:03.620* :  He's like, he's getting the Newfoundland flags ready, he's out looking for Newfoundland
*11:03.640- 11:03.880* :  hats.
*11:04.320- 11:09.660* :  And a little bit before we went, I guess about two weeks, we received a package that included
*11:10.620- 11:18.220* :  an invitation, an actual invite to a Newfoundland kitchen party on the ship, and it was so much
*11:18.260- 11:18.640* :  fun.
*11:20.800- 11:20.860* :  I don't know.
*11:20.860- 11:25.420* :  There was just something so familiar and comforting, but at the same time exotic, because
*11:25.420- 11:31.620* :  we were in this warm, warmest with the tropical cocktails and the little briefs, just to take
*11:31.620- 11:34.880* :  a look at a map and you see where Newfoundland is, it's one of these long emotions.
*11:35.260- 11:39.760* :  And while we're not back in the days when we're, you know, chomping our wood and lugging
*11:39.760- 11:44.180* :  the water, the weather is still a real big drag here in Newfoundland.
*11:44.180- 11:46.720* :  And traveling and getting off the island is a real challenge.
*11:47.200- 11:51.720* :  And we probably celebrated our heritage more there than we would randomly at home.
*11:51.720- 11:52.460* :  It was incredible.
*11:52.460- 11:53.340* :  A lot of fun.
*11:53.980- 11:58.860* :  Now, Pam's story got me thinking about bumping into people you know, a long way from home,
*11:58.860- 12:00.300* :  away from your home country.
*12:00.760- 12:04.720* :  I bumped into a friend of mine called Linwons at the railway station in Paris.
*12:04.860- 12:07.700* :  Neither of us had any idea we're going to be there.
*12:07.820- 12:09.340* :  So has this happened to you?
*12:09.340- 12:15.420* :  If you have a story, we'd like to hear it, global podcast at bbc.co.uk.
*12:16.360- 12:20.520* :  If you've ever experienced the stress of a pet going missing, imagine that happening
*12:20.520- 12:24.180* :  just before you were moving house to the other side of the world.
*12:24.860- 12:29.520* :  Milo, the Jack Russell Cross, escaped from an airport handler in Melbourne, Australia,
*12:29.540- 12:35.100* :  just hours before he was due to fly to his new home in Wales, not New South Wales, but
*12:35.100- 12:36.300* :  Wales in the UK.
*12:37.000- 12:39.200* :  Three weeks later came the reunion.
*12:47.220- 12:47.620* :  Come here, mate.
*12:47.620- 12:47.800* :  Come here, mate.
*12:48.620- 12:49.120* :  Come here, mate.
*12:49.120- 12:49.520* :  Come here, mate.
*12:49.760- 12:50.120* :  Come here, mate.
*12:51.200- 12:52.600* :  Come here, mate.
*12:53.520- 12:53.600* :  Come here, mate.
*12:53.600- 12:55.740* :  Now you can see this video at bbc.com slash news.
*12:55.740- 12:58.960* :  You can hear how emotional Jason Milo's owner is.
*12:58.960- 13:04.420* :  What you can see in the video is Milo leaping into Jason's arms, giving his face a good
*13:04.420- 13:04.740* :  lick.
*13:05.020- 13:08.040* :  His tail could not be wagging more excitedly.
*13:08.200- 13:10.340* :  Jason Watnell spoke to the BBC's Rick Edwards.
*13:11.020- 13:16.700* :  We dropped off Milo through his final bat check and he was handed over to the pet company.
*13:17.260- 13:21.820* :  Essentially, for now or later, we're driving home to get ready for our own flight and I
*13:21.820- 13:25.860* :  got a call saying that he escaped from the handler and he was loose around the suburbs
*13:25.900- 13:26.340* :  in Melbourne.
*13:26.520- 13:28.220* :  So, very concerning.
*13:28.420- 13:33.600* :  We had it back and tried to help look for the whole day, but yeah, we know like, unfortunately,
*13:34.480- 13:37.400* :  and so, so what did you delay your, your own flight out?
*13:37.400- 13:40.220* :  I mean, it must have been an impossible situation for you.
*13:40.440- 13:46.220* :  Yeah, well, look, my partner Nick was on a six month visa and we're literally on the
*13:46.220- 13:50.000* :  cusp of that expiring, so we had no choice but to fly back.
*13:50.880- 13:56.380* :  So, yeah, we kind of searched for the two days prior to our travel, but yeah, we ultimately
*13:56.380- 14:02.000* :  had to get on the flight and head on for us from the UK, I kind of managed, you know,
*14:02.000- 14:07.680* :  volunteers in the community and I did everything I could from over here just to conduct a search
*14:07.680- 14:09.340* :  and get everyone helping.
*14:09.840- 14:14.300* :  I cannot imagine how sick he must have felt getting on that flight, not knowing where Milo
*14:14.300- 14:14.600* :  was.
*14:15.180- 14:15.600* :  Oh, yeah.
*14:15.700- 14:21.240* :  No, it's been a month on that May or a badly slept, you know, very stressful, wondering whether
*14:21.240- 14:24.900* :  we're going to get Milo back, whether he'd be found or, you know, whether he was gone
*14:24.900- 14:25.300* :  for good.
*14:25.420- 14:28.280* :  So, yeah, an array of motions have gone through.
*14:28.280- 14:29.220* :  It's been crazy.
*14:29.560- 14:33.460* :  Yeah, I guess now to talk me through how you felt when you first heard that he'd been
*14:33.460- 14:33.780* :  found.
*14:34.360- 14:34.600* :  Yeah.
*14:35.020- 14:40.020* :  So, when he'd been found, I just saw the motions overcome me and I cried and, you know,
*14:40.020- 14:45.300* :  we celebrated and just to know, you know, he was safe to stand in the skill, you know,
*14:45.300- 14:49.280* :  comfort of the people that were looking after him, just, I mean, a huge sense of relief.
*14:50.160- 14:55.260* :  And then to finally reunite with him, being just an unreal company, these are actually
*14:55.260- 15:00.480* :  over here and the new company that's taken over is giving him an A-Class treatment, come
*15:00.480- 15:07.100* :  over on a first-class flight, you know, it's amazing, that's probably what he was pushing
*15:07.100- 15:07.760* :  for a little while.
*15:07.760- 15:08.280* :  That's true.
*15:09.620- 15:11.080* :  So, I think I could try a little bit better, eh?
*15:13.240- 15:14.220* :  Is he with you now?
*15:14.800- 15:19.660* :  Yeah, he's just, um, cuddled up, sleeping, he's been probably recovering from his jet lag
*15:19.660- 15:24.780* :  after the 24 hours of flying, so, you know, probably impact him just like it does us
*15:25.860- 15:28.380* :  Jason Watnell with Rick Edwards and Rachel Burden.
*15:32.740- 15:37.000* :  Start to come, finding happiness in a new country, and if you're a regular listener to the
*15:37.000- 15:40.100* :  happy pod, there are no prizes for guessing which one.
*15:40.660- 15:44.860* :  You're never far away from a forest or a lake or the seaside in Finland.
*15:45.340- 15:49.720* :  And you're here from the scientists who's using new technology to stop northern white
*15:49.720- 15:51.480* :  rhinos becoming extinct.
*15:52.020- 15:58.020* :  Hi, it's Dr. Aaron Wilder in San Diego, California, and you're listening to the happy pod.
*16:07.320- 16:08.060* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*16:08.060- 16:12.000* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*16:12.260- 16:14.660* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*16:15.000- 16:19.480* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided
*16:20.220- 16:22.380* :  to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*16:22.680- 16:27.680* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*16:27.680- 16:30.640* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com-switch.
*16:30.880- 16:33.840* :  $45 upfront for three months plus taxes and fees, promoting for new customers for limited
*16:33.840- 16:36.880* :  time, unlimited more than 40 gigabytes per month, slows, full turns at MintMobile.com.
*16:37.320- 16:40.600* :  I'm Sandra, and I'm just the professional your small business was looking for.
*16:40.880- 16:43.780* :  But you didn't hire me, because you didn't use LinkedIn jobs.
*16:43.780- 16:48.140* :  LinkedIn has professionals you can't find anywhere else, including those who aren't actively
*16:48.140- 16:51.180* :  looking for a new job, but might be open to the perfect role.
*16:51.580- 16:52.000* :  Like me.
*16:52.560- 16:57.020* :  In a given month, over 70% of LinkedIn users don't visit other leading job sites.
*16:57.280- 17:00.920* :  So if you're not looking on LinkedIn, you'll miss out on great candidates, like Sandra.
*17:01.280- 17:03.360* :  Start hiring professionals like a professional.
*17:03.640- 17:07.040* :  Post your free job on LinkedIn.com-switch-spoken today.
*17:17.720- 17:23.160* :  Is it's personalized algorithm, giving you an endless stream of videos it kind of
*17:23.160- 17:25.260* :  knows you're going to like or at least click on.
*17:25.700- 17:31.040* :  Here's a story about TikTok encouraging people to learn how to read, 35-year-old Oliver
*17:31.040- 17:33.180* :  James couldn't read when he left school.
*17:33.660- 17:37.860* :  In the last few years, he turned to social media and was amazed to find a supportive
*17:38.120- 17:39.160* :  online community.
*17:43.260- 17:47.840* :  When Oliver James left school, he could barely read, but the 35-year-old fitness instructor
*17:47.840- 17:50.040* :  decided to do something about it.
*17:53.740- 17:59.360* :  He opened up about his struggle on social media and then challenged himself to read 100 books
*17:59.360- 18:00.000* :  online.
*18:03.920- 18:08.500* :  Oliver was helped by the book talk community, which shares a love of reading online.
*18:08.540- 18:12.920* :  He gets lots of support in the comments and people share their stories.
*18:12.980- 18:17.200* :  What keeps me going is the people out there who send me a random message and they're like,
*18:17.200- 18:19.980* :  hey, I'm sending my car right now, I never learned to read.
*18:20.120- 18:23.520* :  But at the end, they're like, I just picked up a book, I'm like, hey, since you went,
*18:24.120- 18:24.720* :  I'm going to go today.
*18:24.900- 18:26.500* :  So it's kind of like a pinball effect.
*18:26.700- 18:30.140* :  Around 700 million adults around the world can't read.
*18:30.620- 18:33.280* :  And many more like Oliver struggle with literacy.
*18:33.880- 18:36.520* :  For him, this has been an emotional journey.
*18:36.620- 18:37.260* :  And I'm going to tell you something.
*18:37.260- 18:39.680* :  If you don't know how to read, and you're a don, and you're going to start learning how
*18:39.680- 18:43.900* :  to read, you will not get through this without any vulnerability, bro, like you.
*18:44.820- 18:50.660* :  Oliver reckons his reading skills have improved from about the age of a 7-year-old to a 10-year
*18:50.680- 18:50.900* :  old.
*18:51.420- 18:56.780* :  And he now speaks in schools and communities across the US, spreading the word about literacy.
*18:57.360- 18:58.580* :  Mura Anubi reporting.
*18:59.400- 19:03.640* :  Now we've talked before on the happy part about efforts to bring the Northern White Rhino
*19:03.840- 19:04.840* :  back from the brink.
*19:05.340- 19:10.440* :  Two Northern White Rhino's are left on the planet, both are female, so no reproduction
*19:10.460- 19:11.320* :  is possible.
*19:11.720- 19:16.540* :  But now scientists think they have the technology to develop Northern White Rhino embryos and
*19:16.540- 19:18.120* :  plant them in other animals.
*19:18.760- 19:24.080* :  Dr. Erin Wilder from the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance told me more about the science of
*19:24.220- 19:25.140* :  saving a species.
*19:25.720- 19:32.800* :  We're in the midst of a sixth mass extinction right now where extinction rates are elevated
*19:32.800- 19:37.940* :  and species are going extinct faster than we can save them.
*19:38.480- 19:44.980* :  So being able to restore species from the brink of extinction or an extinct species means
*19:44.980- 19:47.660* :  that we get a second chance to save these species.
*19:48.540- 19:52.860* :  Now there are two Northern White Rhino's left right now.
*19:53.500- 19:55.140* :  Can you describe them to us?
*19:55.500- 20:02.000* :  The two individuals that are left are a mother and a daughter, and both of them are non-reproductive
*20:02.000- 20:04.940* :  females, so they can't produce offspring of their own.
*20:06.020- 20:06.760* :  What do they look like?
*20:06.780- 20:07.560* :  How big are they?
*20:08.920- 20:13.480* :  You know, that's a good question, they're about rhino size, but I couldn't give you a
*20:13.480- 20:13.780* :  number.
*20:14.320- 20:14.900* :  Oh, that's okay.
*20:14.980- 20:18.940* :  You know, just getting a sense of whether they were the size of a, I don't know, a Tyrannosaurus
*20:18.940- 20:19.800* :  Rex or a cat.
*20:20.500- 20:21.100* :  Yeah, yeah.
*20:21.100- 20:25.040* :  Somewhere in between it's Tyrannosaurus Rex and a cat and much closer to the Tyrannosaurus
*20:25.040- 20:25.500* :  Rex.
*20:26.460- 20:33.380* :  Tell me what scientific process you're going through in order to try and eventually be
*20:33.380- 20:37.120* :  in a situation where Northern White Rhino's can be saved.
*20:37.500- 20:41.500* :  Thanks to bio-banking that has been done over the past few decades.
*20:42.120- 20:49.780* :  We've saved material from a number of individuals banked in our frozen zoo, and we also have
*20:49.780- 20:54.120* :  some banked sperm and eggs from these animals.
*20:54.880- 21:02.980* :  And so from this material, we can eventually produce new embryos that could grow into
*21:02.980- 21:07.080* :  mature Northern White Rhino's and create a new population.
*21:07.500- 21:14.640* :  The idea of having a frozen zoo of cells and sperm and eggs of different species is like
*21:14.640- 21:16.240* :  something out of a Hollywood movie.
*21:16.880- 21:22.100* :  An initiative that we at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance have been working to promote
*21:22.100- 21:23.040* :  around the world.
*21:23.620- 21:29.460* :  So you know, the more of these frozen zoos we can get up and running and the more representation
*21:29.460- 21:37.260* :  we have of species, the more opportunities we will have to restore genetic diversity
*21:37.260- 21:40.120* :  that's been lost from these endangered populations.
*21:40.780- 21:44.000* :  I'm imagining some kind of situation where I don't know, someone breaks into the frozen
*21:44.000- 21:48.680* :  zoo and starts using sperm and eggs from different species and mingling them together
*21:48.680- 21:49.820* :  and all sorts could result.
*21:50.640- 21:56.100* :  Yeah, that does seem pretty unlikely because you know, it's already a challenge for us
*21:56.100- 21:58.820* :  to tinker with these, even with full access.
*21:59.920- 22:06.360* :  What are the things that remain in the way of the technology that you can envisage actually
*22:06.360- 22:09.180* :  being able to save creatures like these White Rhino's?
*22:09.780- 22:16.680* :  Well, in order to create sperm and eggs from these fiberglass cell lines, we need to reprogram
*22:16.700- 22:22.160* :  them into stem cells and that we've actually been able to do and do pretty efficiently.
*22:22.940- 22:31.340* :  From there, we need to direct the stem cells to become germ cells and then we need them
*22:31.340- 22:38.340* :  to mature into fully functional sperm and eggs and that process has only been done so
*22:38.340- 22:39.380* :  far in mice.
*22:39.900- 22:45.940* :  It must feel odd to be working on something that could have such radical implications but
*22:45.940- 22:48.840* :  those implications might not come during our lifetime.
*22:50.060- 22:56.920* :  Yes, that is true, but we know that the progress that we make for this species will benefit
*22:56.920- 22:58.220* :  other species as well.
*22:58.220- 23:04.280* :  So even if we don't get to the point where we have a restored Northern White Rhino population
*23:04.280- 23:09.540* :  using these methods, what we learn in this species can be applied to other species.
*23:10.200- 23:12.440* :  Dr. Aaron Wader with me from San Diego.
*23:13.000- 23:16.240* :  If you're with us for the happy part a few weeks ago, you might remember we heard from
*23:16.240- 23:19.960* :  the journalist Erica Benke about a remarkable rescue in Finland.
*23:20.060- 23:24.960* :  Erica used to work with me here at the BBC in London, then she moved to Finland and she
*23:24.960- 23:29.740* :  always talks so passionately about it, make me wonder whether moving to a new country
*23:30.320- 23:31.020* :  makes you happy.
*23:31.340- 23:35.380* :  So Erica's been telling the happy part team more about making such a big change.
*23:36.160- 23:43.400* :  Every time I went to Finland, I found that I'm feeling really happy, I'm happier than
*23:43.400- 23:44.200* :  I am in London.
*23:44.400- 23:50.680* :  I think it was mostly because of nature, you're never far away from a forest or a lake or
*23:50.680- 23:56.280* :  the seaside in Finland and you have personal space which we haven't really got in London.
*23:57.060- 24:01.380* :  I had been living in London for 20 years and the contrast was so huge, so basically I
*24:01.380- 24:05.520* :  fell in love with Finland and I was really sad every time I was coming back.
*24:05.860- 24:11.640* :  So you traveled to Finland a few times but when you moved there, what was your first impression?
*24:11.680- 24:15.460* :  When you decided right, this is where I'm staying, I've got a year here, what was your
*24:15.520- 24:16.240* :  first impression?
*24:16.240- 24:18.960* :  My first impression was how everything just works.
*24:20.080- 24:26.740* :  So the wifi always works, everything just works, everything is on time, the trains are usually
*24:26.740- 24:27.500* :  on time.
*24:27.500- 24:28.100* :  That must be nice.
*24:30.020- 24:31.300* :  There are no signal failures.
*24:31.880- 24:39.200* :  So it's just a country that works and nature that I get out of my house, I close the door
*24:39.200- 24:43.620* :  and I'm either in the forest and if I turn the other way I'm on the seaside and I live
*24:43.620- 24:47.100* :  in a big city, a big city with 200,000 people.
*24:47.820- 24:52.240* :  It all sounds very exciting but it can't have been entirely plain sailing, whether they're
*24:52.240- 24:53.960* :  in challenges or culture shocks.
*24:54.300- 24:56.840* :  No, no, no, it was plain sailing.
*24:57.340- 24:58.240* :  What about the language?
*24:58.580- 25:00.480* :  Because I've heard the language is incredibly difficult.
*25:00.480- 25:03.720* :  Well, the language is difficult but there are two buts.
*25:03.720- 25:07.700* :  One is that Finnish people speak very, very good English.
*25:08.320- 25:14.200* :  The other thing is, the Finnish, the authorities provide every help, you can imagine for you
*25:14.200- 25:15.680* :  to help Finnish if you want to.
*25:15.680- 25:19.160* :  So there are three courses for immigrants and they are very good.
*25:19.980- 25:25.180* :  What would your advice be to anyone listening who's considering making that jump and moving
*25:25.180- 25:26.620* :  somewhere completely new?
*25:27.080- 25:27.760* :  Oh, do it.
*25:27.820- 25:28.700* :  It's amazing.
*25:29.460- 25:30.920* :  I mean, it really worked for me.
*25:31.280- 25:34.200* :  I was Erica Benke with Anna and Harry from the HappyPod team.
*25:34.200- 25:38.080* :  If you've felt happiness by moving to a new country, do tell us the story.
*25:38.080- 25:39.600* :  Why did you decide to move?
*25:39.980- 25:42.460* :  How did you overcome the challenges you faced when you arrived?
*25:42.580- 25:47.460* :  The email globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*25:48.400- 25:53.020* :  You'll have heard us before ask our guests to give us an idea of what the animals they're
*25:53.020- 25:54.740* :  talking about sound like.
*25:55.120- 25:59.020* :  We heard this, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.
*25:59.260- 26:03.020* :  If you've heard him, please give it to whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.
*26:03.440- 26:07.020* :  Well, the story's a bit different because it's not about a real bird.
*26:07.220- 26:12.880* :  It's about a boy who's won a European championship for screeching like a seagull.
*26:13.280- 26:14.120* :  Harry can tell us more.
*26:18.020- 26:22.760* :  I like the noise and how they act and look and how they swim around a lot.
*26:22.900- 26:23.980* :  His name is Cooper.
*26:23.980- 26:27.440* :  He's nine years old and he likes to make seagull noises.
*26:28.260- 26:33.140* :  This week, Cooper, who's from the English town of Chesterfield, won the E.C.
*26:33.140- 26:38.300* :  Gold screeching competition in Belgium, which welcomes participants from all over Europe.
*26:44.940- 26:46.980* :  He was accompanied by his mum, Lauren.
*26:47.520- 26:52.700* :  I just thought my son was just really quite annoying to be honest and making a really loud noise.
*26:52.900- 26:58.600* :  It's a competition held every year and attempts to improve the reputation of seagulls, which
*26:58.600- 27:00.300* :  some people see as a nuisance.
*27:01.020- 27:06.280* :  One says is a marine biologist specialising in seabirds and one of the judges.
*27:06.640- 27:11.500* :  Seagulls have a very rich variety in how they can make noise.
*27:12.020- 27:17.780* :  What we expect from a participant, particularly for those who want to win, the contest, is
*27:17.780- 27:23.480* :  that they can prove that they have listened very carefully and observed the seagulls very
*27:23.480- 27:23.740* :  well.
*27:24.060- 27:26.600* :  That's what Cooper did fantastically well.
*27:26.600- 27:32.160* :  I must say, for me, he was not only the winner of the Juvenile contest, but he was the
*27:32.160- 27:32.920* :  best overall.
*27:33.360- 27:35.180* :  One might say he's the best in the world.
*27:35.980- 27:37.660* :  Yeah, now he's the best in the world, yes.
*27:38.600- 27:42.500* :  Cooper's achievement has made him somewhat of a national hero here in Britain.
*27:42.820- 27:44.920* :  He's appeared across TV and radio.
*27:45.280- 27:48.440* :  I'm so happy that I've run back gold for England.
*27:48.440- 27:50.020* :  It reminds me of the Olympics.
*27:51.580- 27:54.480* :  Cooper's screeching has inspired people, too.
*27:54.980- 27:57.040* :  Here's the BBC's Maria Machiri.
*27:57.240- 28:01.320* :  I can feel that you really want me to do an impression of a seagull, so I'm going to
*28:01.320- 28:01.860* :  give it a go.
*28:01.980- 28:09.660* :  I'm hearing in my ear that I've been sacked, oh well, so lovely, as they say.
*28:10.000- 28:12.060* :  And the British singer, Olly Alexander.
*28:13.580- 28:21.760* :  But on whether Cooper will expand his repertoire to perhaps another species of
*28:21.760- 28:26.200* :  bird or even a different animal altogether, Cooper says no.
*28:26.760- 28:27.900* :  He has other ideas.
*28:28.300- 28:32.240* :  Maybe no other animals or birds, but it might, it's the trumpet definitely.
*28:32.240- 28:33.460* :  Oh, I'm going to go on.
*28:37.120- 28:39.640* :  And Cooper brings this week's happy pod to an end.
*28:43.820- 28:44.800* :  That's all from us for now.
