*00:00.400- 00:05.160* :  People fixing the world is the podcast looking for solutions to the problems we face today.
*00:05.400- 00:08.020* :  It could potentially ease the suffering of millions.
*00:08.160- 00:10.400* :  We have a solution. Let's do it.
*00:10.500- 00:13.580* :  People fixing the world from the BBC World Service.
*00:16.160- 00:19.540* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:21.640- 00:26.180* :  And Janet Gillil, and in the early hours of Monday, the 15th of April, these are our main stories.
*00:26.940- 00:31.380* :  At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, the head of the UN has warned
*00:31.380- 00:37.360* :  the Middle East is on the brink of a full-scale, devastating conflict, a must step back.
*00:38.100- 00:45.580* :  Israel's ambassador to the UN said Iran had crossed every red line with its attack on the Jewish state
*00:45.580- 00:48.300* :  and that Israel reserved the right to retaliate.
*00:49.020- 00:54.160* :  In other news, Haiti's main political parties have urged a quicker transfer of power
*00:54.160- 00:59.640* :  by accusing the outgoing Prime Minister, Ariel Henri, of changing the terms of an agreed deal.
*01:02.300- 01:03.100* :  Also in this podcast?
*01:03.100- 01:10.120* :  If someone says a specific date or like an event, I can just retrieve it in split seconds.
*01:10.800- 01:13.820* :  The teenager with a memory like an encyclopedia.
*01:17.960- 01:21.680* :  Neither the region nor the world can afford more war.
*01:21.880- 01:25.420* :  The words of the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,
*01:25.800- 01:28.120* :  at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council,
*01:28.120- 01:33.580* :  called after Iran carried out its first-ever direct attack on Israel,
*01:33.580- 01:38.540* :  firing hundreds of missiles and drones on the Jewish state on Saturday night.
*01:38.660- 01:44.460* :  Mr. Guterres said people in the Middle East were on the brink of a devastating full-scale conflict.
*01:44.980- 01:47.400* :  It's time to step back from the brink.
*01:48.040- 01:55.020* :  It's vital to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East.
*01:55.800- 01:59.940* :  Civilians are already bearing the brunt and paying the highest price.
*02:01.260- 02:09.700* :  And we have a shared responsibility to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.
*02:10.840- 02:15.520* :  The U.S. has firmly backed Israel in fending off this unprecedented Iranian attack,
*02:15.520- 02:20.880* :  but it's also made it clear it does not want to see the crisis in the Middle East escalate either.
*02:21.300- 02:25.680* :  President Joe Biden is reported to have told the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*02:26.240- 02:30.240* :  that if Israel does decide to go ahead with a counter-offensive against Iran,
*02:30.960- 02:33.400* :  America will not participate in it.
*02:33.900- 02:39.340* :  The U.S. envoy Robert Wood said the UN Security Council needed to strongly condemn Iran.
*02:39.880- 02:44.040* :  The Security Council must unequivocally condemn Iran's aggressive actions
*02:44.500- 02:48.020* :  and call for Iran and its partners and proxies to cease their attacks.
*02:49.140- 02:53.680* :  The United States also supports Israel's exercise of its inherent right to defend itself
*02:54.220- 02:56.800* :  in the face of this attack, and let me be clear.
*02:58.160- 03:03.440* :  If Iran or its proxies take actions against the United States or further action against Israel,
*03:04.320- 03:06.220* :  Iran will be held responsible.
*03:07.220- 03:09.440* :  The United States is not seeking escalation.
*03:10.700- 03:12.800* :  Our actions have been purely defensive in nature.
*03:14.280- 03:20.060* :  The best way to prevent such escalation is an unambiguous condemnation from the council
*03:20.680- 03:26.720* :  of Iran's unprecedented large-scale attack and an unequivocal call on it and its proxies and partners
*03:27.420- 03:28.860* :  to refrain from further violence.
*03:30.060- 03:35.560* :  For his part, Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdogan, said Iran had crossed every red line
*03:35.560- 03:40.040* :  and that Israel reserved the right to retaliate and he also had this to say.
*03:40.380- 03:47.860* :  This attack was launched from Iranian soil, as well as from Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq.
*03:48.520- 03:54.200* :  Colleagues, from the moment I began my tenure here in every speech and in countless letters,
*03:54.820- 03:57.140* :  I rang the warning bell regarding Iran.
*03:58.040- 04:02.700* :  I called on this council to take concrete action against the Ayatollah regime.
*04:03.500- 04:08.140* :  I made it clear that Iran and its hegemonic ambitions of global domination
*04:08.820- 04:13.340* :  must be stopped before it drives the world to a point of no return.
*04:14.540- 04:18.220* :  There was a strong response from Iran's representative, Said Irovani.
*04:18.560- 04:25.240* :  Iran's operation was entirely in the exercise of Iran's inherent right to self-defense
*04:25.300- 04:33.440* :  as outlined in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and be cognized by international law.
*04:34.780- 04:38.980* :  This concluded action was necessary and proportionate.
*04:39.680- 04:46.660* :  It was precise and only targeted military objectives and carried out carefully to minimize
*04:46.660- 04:51.180* :  the potential for escalation and prevents civilian harm.
*04:52.060- 04:53.460* :  So, fiery exchanges.
*04:53.800- 04:56.940* :  Our UN correspondent, Netitoufik, was watching the emergency meeting.
*04:57.300- 04:58.200* :  That's absolutely right.
*04:58.240- 05:00.940* :  Yeah, bitter enemies there in the council.
*05:00.940- 05:08.620* :  And from the Israeli ambassador, really an opportunity to talk about what they wanted here,
*05:08.620- 05:15.500* :  to talk about Iran and what they see as their destabilizing activities in the region as he put it.
*05:15.920- 05:20.640* :  And he said that the, you know, Iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power,
*05:20.640- 05:26.560* :  that he wanted the countries in the Security Council to reimpose sanctions on Iran.
*05:27.300- 05:33.800* :  He also asked for the IRGC to be designated a terrorist organization and said that Israel
*05:33.800- 05:41.520* :  reserved the legal right to retaliate based on Iran's attack, that they won't settle for in action.
*05:42.360- 05:49.400* :  But again, we heard from Iran as well for them, for their part, that they don't seek an escalation
*05:49.400- 05:55.200* :  of the war in the region. They said they were doing this out of self-defense from Israel's attack
*05:55.200- 06:01.940* :  on its embassy. And so they said they proved that by demonstrating a commitment to peace with
*06:01.940- 06:08.120* :  restraint, by warning the United States, underscoring their intent for de-escalation after this,
*06:08.120- 06:14.320* :  not wanting to expand it. But then they also hit on a point that they have also made,
*06:14.320- 06:19.720* :  that they see the root cause of all of this as what's happening in Gaza and the Palestinian
*06:19.720- 06:25.120* :  question, the two-state solution, and really taking a hit at the United States for what they
*06:25.120- 06:29.760* :  call hypocritical behavior and being unable to uphold peace and security in the region.
*06:30.140- 06:36.360* :  Because the U.S. is probably the key player in all of this. The UN Security Council hasn't really
*06:36.360- 06:41.780* :  managed to influence Israel at all very much in the past. And in fact, Israel has criticized
*06:41.860- 06:48.520* :  the UN for past statements. What is the U.S. position on this? And does any of this
*06:48.960- 06:54.440* :  provide some kind of way out for the people of Gaza who've seen so much death and destruction
*06:54.440- 07:00.540* :  in the past six months? It's a great question, because the United States really is kind of the key
*07:00.540- 07:07.300* :  piece here. As you say, the Security Council is bitterly divided, so it's unable to act. And when
*07:07.300- 07:13.520* :  it has been able to, when the United States did agree, finally, to a ceasefire resolution after
*07:13.520- 07:18.040* :  vetoing several ceasefire resolutions, well, we see it's not being implemented on the ground.
*07:18.040- 07:22.900* :  When the United States calls for more aid in Gaza, I mean, children are literally dying of
*07:22.900- 07:29.020* :  starvation, as we speak. The UN says famine is imminent, and yet, you know, aid is not getting
*07:29.020- 07:36.320* :  in nearly enough up until now, despite Israel saying it will open more corridors in Gaza.
*07:37.040- 07:44.100* :  So the United States has expressed its frustration very publicly with Israel when it comes to saying
*07:44.100- 07:48.820* :  it's indiscriminately attacking civilians. It's not letting enough aid in. So there have been
*07:48.820- 07:54.880* :  public disagreements with its ally, even as it has tried to shield it in the council up until recently.
*07:55.580- 08:00.780* :  And we have heard here today, well, heard from the United States, that they don't want
*08:00.780- 08:06.660* :  an escalation. President Biden warning Israel that they will not join any retaliatory attack against
*08:06.660- 08:12.940* :  Iran. But at the same time, using this forum to say that they stand rock solid in Israel's
*08:12.940- 08:17.540* :  defense. So the United States is in a situation where the rest of the world is looking at them,
*08:17.920- 08:23.860* :  hoping that they can prevent a slide into an all-out war in the Middle East, and hoping President
*08:23.860- 08:30.720* :  Biden can use his influence to do that. Nitatalphic. So the big question now is how Israel
*08:30.720- 08:36.180* :  will respond to all these calls for restraint. Israel says it was able to intercept nearly all of
*08:36.180- 08:40.580* :  the incoming projectiles with the help of its allies, including the U.S., Britain, Jordan,
*08:40.580- 08:46.240* :  and France. No one was killed and the damage was minor, although one younger was critically wounded.
*08:46.720- 08:51.220* :  A senior minister, Benny Gantz, made it clear that Israel would wait a while as it considers
*08:51.220- 08:58.900* :  what action to take in response to Saturday's attack. Yesterday, Iran launched an attack on Israel
*08:58.900- 09:05.100* :  and met the strength of the Israeli security sister. Iran is a global problem. It is a regional
*09:05.100- 09:10.760* :  challenge, and it is also a danger to Israel. And yesterday, the world clearly stood together
*09:10.760- 09:16.800* :  with Israel in the face of the danger. Faced with the threat of Iran, we will build a regional
*09:16.800- 09:22.360* :  coalition and collect the price from Iran, in a way and at a time that suits us.
*09:23.480- 09:27.620* :  But our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bishegar in Jerusalem told us that Israel's allies are
*09:27.620- 09:33.260* :  deeply worried about what it might be planning. So we still don't know how Israel is going to
*09:33.260- 09:38.020* :  respond to this attack if the Israelis are going to go ahead with any kind of retaliation.
*09:38.480- 09:44.200* :  Obviously, the Israeli authorities had warned before this attack that any kind of direct attack
*09:44.200- 09:50.500* :  from Iran would lead to an Israeli response. But I think what we're seeing today is that there's
*09:50.500- 09:56.080* :  been a massive effort to try to de-escalate the situation. There was a phone call between President
*09:56.080- 10:02.400* :  Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu overnight, and President Biden reaffirmed America's commitment
*10:02.400- 10:08.420* :  to the security of Israel. But there have been reports suggesting that he also said that the U.S.
*10:08.420- 10:14.320* :  will not support any kind of Israeli retaliation. And now we're hearing from an American official saying
*10:14.320- 10:20.980* :  that Israel needs to think carefully about its next steps because of the risk of regional escalation.
*10:21.540- 10:27.140* :  What impact has all this had on Israelis? Because school activities were cancelled yesterday,
*10:27.140- 10:33.640* :  as troops were put on high alert. Are those measures easing? Have Israelis been reassured
*10:33.720- 10:37.240* :  by the fact that nearly all these missiles and drones were intercepted?
*10:37.940- 10:42.600* :  Yes, so the measures there were announced today, which also included restrictions on public
*10:42.600- 10:48.920* :  gatherings, expired tomorrow night. Today, there was already the feeling of life going back to normal
*10:48.920- 10:55.080* :  here. The airspace reopened this morning. Shops were busy. Lots of people went back to work. Today
*10:55.080- 11:00.320* :  was the first day of the work week. There were no restrictions in place. And I spoke with some
*11:00.520- 11:07.500* :  Israelis today. And almost everybody I talked to was celebrating the fact that the Israeli
*11:07.500- 11:14.040* :  defense was extremely successful. 99% of those drones and missiles were intercepted by the Israeli
*11:14.040- 11:19.180* :  military and also by its allies. So it is a sort of celebration today here.
*11:20.140- 11:24.900* :  Yes, because up until quite recently, Prime Minister Netanyahu has been facing fierce
*11:24.900- 11:31.160* :  criticism from outside Israel from allies even President Biden for the way Israel is conducting
*11:31.160- 11:37.920* :  its war in Gaza. With troops still there, can Israel afford to carry out a strike in Iran that
*11:37.920- 11:44.340* :  could spiral into a wider regional conflict? Yeah, I think, you know, this is the key question here.
*11:44.340- 11:50.660* :  And this is the main fear, the possibility of a wider regional conflict. And I think that's the
*11:50.660- 11:56.660* :  reason why there's been a lot of diplomatic activity to try to reduce stations from the G7
*11:56.660- 12:04.240* :  to the UN Security Council. Now, many believe that given the magnitude of this Iranian attack,
*12:04.240- 12:09.600* :  that the Israelis need to give some kind of response. But some others believe that it is time for
*12:09.600- 12:15.220* :  restraint that despite the scale of this attack, it didn't really have an impact on the ground
*12:15.220- 12:21.360* :  because again, 99% of the drones and missiles were intercepted. So I think many people here just
*12:21.360- 12:27.600* :  trying to draw a line and try to consider this case resolved. You go to Shegar in Jerusalem.
*12:28.580- 12:33.640* :  Iran says a new equation in its confrontation with Israel has been opened. The chief of Iran's army,
*12:33.640- 12:40.060* :  General Muhammad Hussein Bagari, warned of a much bigger assault if Israel does decide to respond.
*12:41.700- 12:47.840* :  From our point of view, this operation is over. And there is no intention to continue the operation.
*12:48.400- 12:53.680* :  But if the Zionist regime takes any action against the Islamic Republic, whether on our soil,
*12:53.680- 12:59.360* :  or in places belonging to us in Syria or elsewhere, our next operation will be much larger.
*13:00.080- 13:06.220* :  Hardly any of the missiles fired by Iran hit their targets with Israel saying it intercepted 99%
*13:06.500- 13:13.100* :  of them. I'll see a Vashmadi Ardlan from the BBC Persian Service. Given that, how was the attack
*13:13.100- 13:18.960* :  being viewed in Iran? So we have two narratives going on here at the same time. One is this figure of
*13:18.960- 13:24.420* :  99% interception, which shows that Iran miserably failed in its attack. On the other hand, we're hearing
*13:24.420- 13:30.620* :  that Iran, on a very calculated base, it made a calibrated move. So really it designed itself
*13:30.620- 13:35.940* :  to fail. So these two narratives run in contradiction to each other. But will the Iranian officials
*13:35.940- 13:41.900* :  have said and have confirmed this proposition that its response was calibrated? Was the fact that
*13:41.900- 13:47.220* :  they give 72 hour notification to its neighbors? And also they assured the US that the attack would
*13:47.220- 13:52.820* :  be limited. So I guess that went a long way in terms of satisfying the regime, the Iranian
*13:52.820- 13:59.720* :  regime's popular base that Iran is not a pushover, but at the same time did not engage. And that
*13:59.720- 14:06.340* :  kind of a response and all-out response that would automatically invite an Israeli retaliation.
*14:06.600- 14:14.000* :  And if Israel was to carry out an attack on Iranian soil, how would Iran respond? Would we be
*14:14.000- 14:19.360* :  looking at all-out war? Well, it depends on the kind of response that Israel decides to take on.
*14:19.360- 14:24.440* :  If Israel, from the range of options that's available to Israel, if Prime Minister Netanyahu and
*14:24.440- 14:30.200* :  his war cabinet decide to exercise some strategic patience of their own, well, then yes, whether
*14:30.200- 14:35.420* :  what the head of the revolutionary guards said today, that we change the equation now for every
*14:35.420- 14:39.920* :  time that Israel attacks us, we will carry out a similar assault, which is unlikely to happen if
*14:39.920- 14:45.420* :  Israel does anything to Iran. But if Israel decides to take on the other extreme range of its
*14:45.420- 14:52.620* :  options, an all-out attack on Iran's military and nuclear sites, then it may very well be likely
*14:52.620- 14:58.140* :  that Iran can walk out of the MPT, that Iran could launch an attack on Israel's demonar nuclear
*14:58.140- 15:02.380* :  facilities, and unleash the missile arsenal of his will line Lebanon.
*15:02.540- 15:08.840* :  Sivash Meddi Adlan. Well, Matthew and Rolliwala asked our security correspondent Gordon Carrera,
*15:08.840- 15:14.680* :  what Saturday nights unprecedented attack on Israel by Iran means for the wider Middle East?
*15:14.820- 15:21.800* :  Unprecedented in that sense, the two sides have been engaged in a shadow war for decades really,
*15:21.800- 15:28.020* :  in which Iran has been using its proxies, groups like Hezbollah to fire missiles and carry out
*15:28.020- 15:33.620* :  other activities against Israel and even inside Israel, and Israel has been targeting, for instance,
*15:33.620- 15:38.900* :  Iranian nuclear scientists going back decades, including within Iran, but you've not seen that
*15:38.900- 15:45.600* :  kind of direct confrontation that we've seen, and including that targeting of an Iranian consulate
*15:46.060- 15:51.600* :  in Damascus. So I think it is an escalation, it is significant, but the question is what next?
*15:51.900- 15:57.360* :  Well, exactly, because President Biden and others can talk about containment, but there are so
*15:57.360- 16:02.280* :  many variables at play, aren't they? That's right, and you can sense from the language coming out
*16:02.280- 16:07.980* :  from the US that they are urging both publicly and I'm sure behind the scenes, Israel to carry out
*16:07.980- 16:14.500* :  a measured response in how it deals with this because the US do not want to escalate into a wider
*16:14.500- 16:19.840* :  war. All the signs have been that Iran also doesn't want to escalate into a wider war to get into a
*16:20.240- 16:25.560* :  war with the United States, which could obviously be very serious for the regime in Tehran.
*16:25.940- 16:32.300* :  So there are incentives not to escalate, but the reality of these situations is often that
*16:32.300- 16:38.060* :  events can spiral out of control, and you could imagine a situation in which one side launches
*16:38.060- 16:43.820* :  a strike which kills more, does more damage than expected, and that does lead to an escalation
*16:43.820- 16:49.980* :  which can drag more parties in and lead to more significant strikes. So I think that is the concern,
*16:50.200- 16:54.900* :  as everyone waits to see what Israel will do. I mean, the noises coming out of Israel are mixed.
*16:55.040- 17:01.100* :  I mean, we've heard some of the more hawkish members are linked to Netanyahu and his coalition
*17:01.100- 17:07.280* :  talking about the need to reestablish deterrence, which would mean a hardline stance and some kind of
*17:07.280- 17:11.680* :  strike against Iranian interests, others like Benny Gantz, who's in the war cabinet, have talked
*17:11.680- 17:17.920* :  about rather responding in a manner and a means of a time of their choosing, which would suggest a
*17:17.920- 17:23.360* :  more measured careful response. So I think there will be lots of thoughts, lots of behind the scenes
*17:23.360- 17:30.020* :  negotiations to try and work out what that response might be, and I think it's hard to say exactly
*17:30.020- 17:35.300* :  at the moment. Given what you have just said, and we're looking at a picture from the situation room
*17:35.300- 17:41.660* :  with Joe Biden watching those events unfold. The White House putting out this line that Joe Biden
*17:41.660- 17:47.960* :  has told Netanyahu that the U.S. would not participate in a counter-offensive against Iran
*17:47.960- 17:55.220* :  if Israel launches one. So do you think that is helpful in the sense that it is a very clear line
*17:55.220- 18:00.440* :  that it's already been drawn and been drawn publicly? Yes, and I think behind the scenes what
*18:00.440- 18:05.280* :  you hear the Americans are supposedly saying to the Israelis is this has gone pretty well for
*18:05.280- 18:10.720* :  Israel's point of view. Iran felt it had to strike back for that attack on the consular building.
*18:10.720- 18:17.680* :  Iran did strike back, but actually Israel was able to knock out 99% of the drones and missiles
*18:17.680- 18:22.560* :  that were launched and there was very little damage according to Israel. So the American
*18:22.560- 18:29.140* :  message is to say Israel should largely take that rather than to escalate again and to try and
*18:29.140- 18:37.240* :  put a lid if you like on the situation. Gordon Carrera. Still to come? If I needed to turn left,
*18:37.240- 18:44.240* :  he'd say go left in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go right in the same manner. If there were people in front of me,
*18:44.240- 18:49.860* :  he'd tell me to slow down. The hardening story of a blind man who's become the first person to
*18:49.860- 19:01.920* :  complete a marathon not tied to another runner. People fixing the world is the podcast looking for
*19:01.920- 19:07.020* :  solutions to the problems we face today. It could potentially ease the suffering of millions.
*19:07.020- 19:12.820* :  We meet people with smart ideas to discover how they might change the world for the better.
*19:13.000- 19:17.940* :  And this is a fairly cheap and easy way to get a lot more solar capacity into the middle of cities.
*19:18.120- 19:23.520* :  People fixing the world from the BBC World Service. We have a solution. Let's do it.
*19:23.680- 19:26.540* :  Listen now, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*19:31.500- 19:37.240* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Hades main political parties have urged the outgoing
*19:37.240- 19:42.460* :  Prime Minister, Ariel Henri, to speed up the installation of a new transitional council
*19:42.460- 19:48.420* :  that is due to take over power and organise the next presidential election. Mr. Henri promised
*19:48.420- 19:54.380* :  to stand down a month ago. Leonardo Russia reports. Mr. Henri has been in power since the
*19:54.380- 20:00.260* :  assassination of President Jovenel Moise three years ago which plunged the country into unprecedented
*20:00.260- 20:05.960* :  levels of gang violence and lawlessness. He agreed to resign after Hades' powerful gang leaders
*20:06.420- 20:11.240* :  took control of the country's main airport and blocked his return from an international trip.
*20:11.780- 20:16.420* :  A transitional council representing different parties and political groups should already have
*20:16.420- 20:22.040* :  been installed to replace Mr. Henri, who's still in Puerto Rico. But they say that a decree he
*20:22.040- 20:27.740* :  published on Friday failed to mention the names of the nine council members and created new obstacles
*20:27.740- 20:34.060* :  to their appointments. Leonardo Russia. People in Australia are mourning the deaths of five women
*20:34.060- 20:38.760* :  in a male security guard who died trying to stop a man wielding a knife from killing others at
*20:38.760- 20:44.840* :  a Sydney shopping centre. The attacker has been identified as 40-year-old Jao Kouchi, a man with a
*20:44.840- 20:50.700* :  history of mental health problems. A lone police woman is being hailed as a hero after she tracked
*20:50.700- 20:55.640* :  him through the building as he carried out his rampage. She challenged him and shot him dead as he
*20:55.640- 21:01.360* :  tried to stab her. Twelve people were wounded, among them a baby girl, whose mother was one of those
*21:01.360- 21:06.880* :  killed. Regular visitors to the shopping centre like 14-year-old Emily Colonyt are struggling to
*21:06.880- 21:12.420* :  comprehend what happened. I go to that like more with my friend and stuff, but it's just sad to think
*21:12.420- 21:17.140* :  like you're kind of really like a shop normally now without thinking twice about like who's around you
*21:17.140- 21:22.600* :  and all that stuff. With more on what might have motivated the attacker, here's our correspondent in
*21:22.600- 21:28.300* :  Sydney Katie Watson. People have been coming here throughout the day to leave flowers and pay their
*21:28.300- 21:33.520* :  tribute to the victims. There's still very much and ongoing investigation. The shopping mall is still
*21:33.520- 21:38.480* :  closed. It's an active crime scene and police teams are still working there. They're expected to
*21:38.480- 21:43.840* :  be working there until at least the early hours of Monday morning. More details have come out
*21:43.840- 21:52.600* :  over the day, the name of the assailant Jao Kouchi, 40-year-old man from Queensland in terms of
*21:52.880- 21:58.900* :  motives. They're still very reminded about exactly how and why this attack took place. They say
*21:58.900- 22:04.600* :  authorities say that ideology wasn't identified as one of the reasons. Mental health issues
*22:04.600- 22:10.980* :  certainly might be playing a part in this. He was known to police. They're also exploring the
*22:10.980- 22:16.560* :  line of inquiry of whether or not women were a target given that five out of the six people who
*22:16.560- 22:22.100* :  were killed were women. There's been more details of course about the victims, actually good,
*22:22.560- 22:27.920* :  was the mother of a nine-month-old little girl. She was killed in the attack and her daughter
*22:27.920- 22:33.780* :  was also stabbed. She went to hospital underwent surgery and the family say she's doing well.
*22:34.200- 22:41.300* :  Another one man who was killed in Saturday's attack, he has been named as for us to hear a 30-year-old
*22:41.300- 22:46.220* :  from Pakistan. He fled persecution from Pakistan just a year ago and he was working as a security
*22:46.220- 22:52.060* :  guard in the shopping centre. But this is an investigation that's very much still continuing and of
*22:52.060- 22:57.820* :  course will continue for the next weeks and months. Katie Watson in Sydney. The war in Ukraine could
*22:57.820- 23:02.980* :  lead to another big rise in energy prices, especially in Europe, according to the man who used to run
*23:02.980- 23:08.420* :  the country's state oil company. Andrey Kobolyev said Russian attacks on gas and electricity
*23:08.420- 23:14.140* :  plants were far worse than they had been in the previous winter. Here's our Europe regional editor,
*23:14.460- 23:19.700* :  Paul Moss. Ukraine won't say exactly how much damage there's been to its energy infrastructure,
*23:20.300- 23:25.300* :  but Russia now seems to be focused on hitting its generating capacity. And that warrants
*23:25.300- 23:31.120* :  Andrey Kobolyev will put up prices across Europe. That's firstly because Ukraine itself will need
*23:31.120- 23:36.460* :  to get energy from elsewhere. However, there's also a fear that its vast energy storage facilities
*23:36.460- 23:42.040* :  will come under Russian control. Indeed, just the possibility of a Moscow victory could lead to a
*23:42.040- 23:46.840* :  price hike, Mr. Kobolyev said. He acknowledged Ukraine had attack Russian gas facilities,
*23:46.840- 23:53.020* :  but said there was an energy war underway. Paul Moss. Now, what if I was to ask you what you were
*23:53.020- 23:59.740* :  wearing this day four weeks ago? How about four months ago? Or even four years ago?
*24:00.060- 24:04.360* :  You and I might struggle to remember, but there are a select few who would find this question
*24:05.180- 24:10.140* :  extremely easy to answer. That's because they have a memory that's like an encyclopedia
*24:10.140- 24:16.960* :  or a search engine, and they can access that information in an instant. One such person is Emily
*24:16.960- 24:22.400* :  Nash from Canada, and her extraordinary ability is being studied by a team of scientists.
*24:22.400- 24:27.700* :  Stephanie Prentice reports. People with a highly autobiographical memory can recall
*24:27.700- 24:33.680* :  information from any time in their life and watch any day back, just like watching a film.
*24:34.240- 24:37.260* :  They don't need mnemonics or other prompts to trigger recall,
*24:37.260- 24:41.780* :  and fewer than a hundred people in the world have ever formally been diagnosed.
*24:42.020- 24:49.260* :  If someone says a specific date or like an event, I can just retrieve it in split seconds.
*24:49.920- 24:55.300* :  Emily Nash, a teenager from Canada, was recently tested by a group of experts in Chicago
*24:55.300- 25:01.940* :  and in Texas. It pops into my head and it's almost like a visual. I can remember like the specific
*25:01.940- 25:09.000* :  day it happened, sometimes even the time and what happened exactly. Emily can remember the details
*25:09.000- 25:14.940* :  of any day in her life, including what she was wearing, who she was with, and everything she ate.
*25:14.940- 25:20.820* :  She can also pull out details of days from before she was born, if she's ever heard any information
*25:20.820- 25:27.300* :  about them. Okay, how about October 4th 1970? I know you weren't alive then, but is there anything
*25:27.300- 25:34.000* :  specific about that day? Oh, Jenna Stroplin died. Common Westerberg, a psychologist at Texas State
*25:34.000- 25:39.660* :  University who's been studying Emily's memory to try and understand it, but also to harness
*25:39.660- 25:45.780* :  that knowledge to help others. If we can figure out what exactly is happening that makes her have
*25:45.780- 25:53.340* :  such a good memory. If we can somehow use that information to help people who have failing memory
*25:53.520- 25:59.000* :  and with our society today, living longer, which is great, but that means there's a lot more cases
*25:59.000- 26:04.440* :  of memory problems. So that's why I think it's really important to try and figure out what's going
*26:04.440- 26:10.740* :  on. People with this sort of memory often say the worst part is they remember every bad thing that's
*26:10.740- 26:18.000* :  ever happened to them, but they also remember every kind word, gift or special occasion. And whenever
*26:18.000- 26:23.620* :  they want, they have the option to time travel. Usually during my free time, I like to bring up
*26:23.620- 26:30.180* :  positive memories, the good memories that I have. Just remembering like special days of my life and
*26:30.260- 26:37.300* :  all the nice things like everyone has ever done for me and just basically remembering like all
*26:37.300- 26:43.440* :  the positive things that helped shape who I am today. That was Human Encyclopedia, Emily Nash,
*26:43.440- 26:49.700* :  ending that report by Stephanie Prentice. A man who lost his sight during a COVID lockdown has become
*26:49.700- 26:55.700* :  the first blind runner in the world to complete a marathon without a guide attached to him by a
*26:55.700- 27:00.280* :  tether. Yaya Pandore, who's 28, ran the Manchester marathon in Northern England,
*27:00.740- 27:06.420* :  relying only on the voiced instructions of his guide nearby. He finished this his first ever
*27:06.420- 27:14.500* :  marathon in four hours, 22 minutes and 23 seconds, beating his own target time. He told Julian Marshall
*27:14.500- 27:20.920* :  how he was able to accomplish this feat. So I'm fully blind and I had a guide run with me,
*27:20.920- 27:26.680* :  but he wasn't connected to me in any way. And he gave me voice commands throughout the entire
*27:26.680- 27:32.460* :  process. So if I needed to turn left, he'd say go left in five, four, three, two, one, go
*27:32.460- 27:37.180* :  right in the same manner. If there were people in front of me, he'd tell me to slow down.
*27:37.220- 27:42.000* :  If there was uneven footing on the ground, he'd be like, be careful where you're stepping,
*27:42.000- 27:47.440* :  just because it's uneven ground. And he also audio described the entire process, what was
*27:47.440- 27:53.400* :  happening and the buildings around me, what people were wearing, just so I could gauge where he was
*27:53.400- 27:59.920* :  by hearing. So I didn't go off track. I mean, that's quite an achievement. I mean, if I think of
*27:59.920- 28:08.200* :  myself closing my eyes and trying to run, I'd be all over the place. I am mentally and physically
*28:08.200- 28:13.080* :  drained from it. It's challenging enough navigating everyday life as a blind person,
*28:13.080- 28:17.960* :  so to do something like this is taking every ounce of my energy, I think.
*28:17.980- 28:23.960* :  So why did you decide to do it? I love setting myself challenges. And I think there are many
*28:23.960- 28:30.000* :  perceptions out there amongst any disabilities, not just blind people that they aren't as capable,
*28:30.000- 28:36.320* :  they can't do as many things. And I want to prove to anyone out there that no being different,
*28:36.320- 28:42.660* :  being disabled, being blind does not make me any different. And then I can do what others can.
*28:43.500- 28:49.360* :  And I assume that other people taking part in the race were quite accommodating, were they?
*28:49.900- 28:54.960* :  Yes, they were really supportive. You know, had loads of people coming through, keeping me going,
*28:54.960- 29:01.080* :  pushing me on and really encouraging me. And were you obviously blind to spectators?
*29:01.940- 29:07.880* :  So my top that I wore, just as a, you know, so people know, and so they can be a bit careful around me,
*29:07.880- 29:13.880* :  says, blind runner. And my top is bright ink, I think, with bold lecturing on there. So I think
*29:13.880- 29:18.280* :  it would be visible to anyone around me. Because certainly when I competed in a marathon,
*29:18.280- 29:26.280* :  I found that having my name on my vest and spectators calling it out, carried me along in a
*29:26.280- 29:31.320* :  most extraordinary way. It was, yes, and a lot of them were shouting my name,
*29:32.800- 29:36.780* :  which is pretty incredible, really. So how did you feel afterwards?
*29:38.820- 29:44.540* :  Later than exhausted, the two words, you know, extremely proud of myself. And a massive
*29:44.540- 29:48.860* :  thanks to my guide runner, George, who helped me, you know, I wouldn't have been able to do it
*29:48.860- 29:53.420* :  without him. And grateful in a way, there are so many people that don't have the opportunity
*29:53.420- 29:59.480* :  to run, and I can. So yeah, grateful as well. And many congratulations on your time of four
*29:59.480- 30:08.280* :  hours and 22 minutes, which, what is about, I don't know, two hours less than I managed a marathon?
*30:09.300- 30:15.520* :  It's the training, I think, I've been training a lot, and yeah, as far as the next thing is to
*30:15.520- 30:20.400* :  improve on the time. Yaya Pandora, the first blind person to compete in marathon until
*30:20.400- 30:26.840* :  they're talking to fellow runner Julian Marshall. And that's all from us for now, but there will
