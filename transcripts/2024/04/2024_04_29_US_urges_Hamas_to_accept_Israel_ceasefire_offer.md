*01:17.920- 01:21.900* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.060- 01:30.900* :  I'm Jackie Leonard, and at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 29th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:31.620- 01:37.280* :  The US Secretary of State has urged Hamas to accept what he called Israel's extraordinarily
*01:37.280- 01:43.640* :  generous ceasefire proposal for Gaza. Dozens of people have been killed after a damn burst
*01:43.640- 01:50.020* :  in central Kenya. The Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says he won't quit over what he
*01:50.020- 01:57.660* :  called toxic accusations of corruption against his wife. I have decided to carry on. To carry on
*01:57.660- 02:03.280* :  with more strength as Prime Minister of Spain. But Scotland's First Minister, Humza Yusuf, has announced
*02:03.280- 02:08.640* :  he is stepping down after his power-sharing deal with the Green Party fell apart last week.
*02:11.200- 02:18.100* :  Also in this podcast, the cleanup after deadly tornadoes in the US and protests against Israel's
*02:18.100- 02:29.720* :  participation in Eurovision in Sweden. We begin in Gaza where following a lot of false storms on
*02:29.720- 02:35.860* :  a possible halt to the fighting, it looks like there could be a glimmer of light on the horizon.
*02:35.860- 02:41.520* :  Hamas leaders have said they see no major issues with the latest Israeli proposals.
*02:42.340- 02:46.740* :  As we record this podcast, Hamas delegation is due in Egypt for talks.
*02:47.320- 02:53.180* :  And today in Saudi Arabia, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken ramped up the pressure on
*02:53.180- 03:01.740* :  Hamas leaders to say yes. Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily generous
*03:03.240- 03:08.780* :  on the part of Israel. And in this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and
*03:08.780- 03:16.860* :  a ceasefire is Hamas. They have to decide and they have to decide quickly. So we're looking to that.
*03:18.860- 03:24.460* :  And I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision and we can have a fundamental change in
*03:24.460- 03:31.460* :  the in the dynamic. It's not just Hamas the US is pressuring. Mr Blinken also reaffirmed US
*03:31.460- 03:37.240* :  opposition to a planned Israeli offensive on Rafa City saying he's seen no plan that protects
*03:37.240- 03:42.940* :  civilians there. Twenty people died in overnight Israeli air strikes. Our correspondent
*03:42.940- 03:49.440* :  We're a Davis is in Jerusalem. So just how much optimism is there around these talks more
*03:49.440- 03:54.280* :  optimism than has been for some time. But you're right to be skeptical. I think as is every other
*03:54.280- 04:00.100* :  observer because the starting point is that Israel and Hamas are very far apart. When they do talk,
*04:00.100- 04:04.240* :  they don't talk directly. These are indirect talks. And the last round of talks in Cairo,
*04:04.240- 04:09.660* :  the Israelis didn't even attend because they were so far apart. But it does appear that Israel in
*04:09.660- 04:15.340* :  particular seems to have made certain concessions among them. Hamas had demanded that Israeli troops
*04:15.340- 04:21.040* :  should withdraw from most of Gaza. There seems to be some movement on that demand. And the other one
*04:21.040- 04:26.100* :  was that Palestinian citizens should be allowed to return to their home areas or watch left of their
*04:26.100- 04:30.600* :  home areas in the north of Gaza. Israel also seems to be making some concessions on that.
*04:31.100- 04:36.460* :  There's also reported to be an agreement on the number of hostages that would be released in
*04:36.460- 04:41.400* :  exchange to Palestinian prisoners. So a significant narrowing of the gap between them.
*04:41.740- 04:46.420* :  But obviously as I said, there's a lot of mistrust. The talks haven't yet started although
*04:46.420- 04:51.540* :  Hamas officials are thought to have gone to Cairo. And Egyptian officials have been shutling back
*04:51.540- 04:57.160* :  and forth between Cairo and Jerusalem. So I think there is undoubtedly some significant progress.
*04:57.160- 05:01.760* :  Although time is running out with this planned Israeli military operation in southern Gaza.
*05:02.120- 05:06.660* :  And there isn't absolute unity within the Israeli government over this either, is there?
*05:07.080- 05:10.660* :  No, there are hardline members of the Israeli government. Ministers like Basel El Smotrich
*05:10.740- 05:16.940* :  and Itamar Ben Gavir who say that to agree to a cease-fire before Israel completely defeats
*05:16.940- 05:22.180* :  her massing Gaza would be in effect a defeat. But those voices are minority voices. There's an
*05:22.180- 05:28.900* :  increasing sway in the Israeli public which wants the government to prioritize getting the hostages
*05:28.900- 05:34.100* :  released. There are about 130 hostages thought to remain in captivity. Perhaps a hundred of those
*05:34.100- 05:39.080* :  still alive. And they are believed to be in and around the southern town of Rafa as well.
*05:39.520- 05:45.440* :  And it's increasing concern here that if Israel does proceed with this military operation in southern
*05:45.440- 05:50.840* :  Gaza in Rafa that it will not only obviously achieve Israel's military objectives, but it could
*05:50.840- 05:55.820* :  jeopardize the lives of the remaining hostages. So people in Israel generally now want their
*05:55.820- 05:59.320* :  government to prioritize the hostages over their military aims.
*05:59.760- 06:05.480* :  That was were Davis. More than 40 people have been killed and an unknown number are missing
*06:05.480- 06:12.000* :  after a dam burst in central Kenya just north of Nairobi. They are the latest casualties following
*06:12.000- 06:17.980* :  weeks of torrential rain and flash flooding. Large areas of East Africa have battled intense
*06:17.980- 06:24.800* :  downpours in recent months, displacing more than 130,000 people. Our Africa correspondent Barbara
*06:24.940- 06:31.620* :  Asha has been to the scene. Incredible damage actually. The water came crashing through the
*06:31.620- 06:37.440* :  village in the middle of the night from a burst dam. Basically gouging out the valley and the
*06:37.440- 06:43.340* :  that is runs on the edges of the village and and the river overflowed its banks. So that massive
*06:43.340- 06:50.580* :  water taking so much with it's cars, trees, houses. I'm looking at an uprooted tree right now,
*06:50.580- 06:56.200* :  a damaged car just a few meters away. Also people of course, dozens of people were taken by the
*06:56.200- 07:01.760* :  water and have been killed. They're still ongoing searching for bodies. As well as just people
*07:01.760- 07:07.300* :  wandering around trying to get their heads around what a great disaster this has been. We've
*07:07.300- 07:11.920* :  spoken to one young man who has been up since three trying to help people, rescue people, pull
*07:11.920- 07:17.080* :  them out of the mud, pull them out of the water. Amazingly his house was not affected but his entire
*07:17.080- 07:21.580* :  neighborhood essentially was swept away. He spoke to another man who was also able to save his
*07:22.040- 07:27.660* :  wife and children but then he also went to try and rescue people and that is ongoing. It's just
*07:27.660- 07:35.700* :  been an incredibly sudden and very damaging flood. But this has just been the latest in a string
*07:35.700- 07:41.220* :  of flood related disaster, isn't it? Well yes, it has. There's been very heavy rains here for
*07:41.220- 07:46.740* :  the past month and so in different parts of the country you've had floods and also casualties,
*07:46.740- 07:52.800* :  you had for instance people trying to cross flooded roads in vehicles and one case with the
*07:52.800- 07:57.080* :  vehicle was swept away into the water and people were also drowned there. You had people using
*07:57.080- 08:02.900* :  small boats trying to get across a road overcrowded and then the boat flipping over and again
*08:03.060- 08:08.360* :  them dying. So you've had people die but you've also had a lot of damage to roads, bridges
*08:09.220- 08:13.860* :  and to land and what the government officials are warning about is that dams are pretty much
*08:13.860- 08:18.980* :  full now. So you had this one break but there are others that could break and they're warning people
*08:18.980- 08:23.840* :  to move out of the pathway because the rains continue. They're also forecasting heavy rains
*08:24.300- 08:29.380* :  as we go into as we go into the week. And given all the infrastructure damage that you're talking
*08:29.380- 08:35.520* :  about, how all the emergency services coping with the need? Well they're struggling. I mean you've
*08:35.520- 08:40.940* :  got the Red Cross for example participating today and trying to help people who try to find the
*08:41.260- 08:49.060* :  dead and injured from the flood here in Maemiahau village. But it is going to be a challenge for
*08:49.060- 08:54.660* :  the government to rebuild. They have allocated 3.3 billion Kenyan shillings I think
*08:55.220- 09:00.500* :  to try to start repairing the infrastructure. They've also sent out warnings to people not to
*09:00.500- 09:05.540* :  be, you know, to take great care when they take public transport. They don't just casually go
*09:05.540- 09:10.420* :  into the water thinking you'll make it across. So they have put out warnings on that score as well
*09:10.460- 09:14.540* :  but there's no question that this is going to be something that the government will have to work hard
*09:14.540- 09:21.240* :  to cope with. Barbara Plesasza. Days after cancelling all public duties, the Spanish Prime Minister
*09:21.240- 09:28.880* :  Pedro Sánchez has said he's decided he will remain in post. I've decided to continue to go on
*09:28.880- 09:33.380* :  if possible even stronger as the Prime Minister of Spain's government. This decision doesn't
*09:33.380- 09:38.880* :  mean business as usual. Things are going to be different and I can guarantee that. That's why I assume
*09:38.880- 09:43.960* :  in front of you my commitment to work without rest firmly and with serenity for the pending
*09:43.960- 09:49.220* :  regeneration of our democracy as well as for the progress and strengthening of our rights and freedoms.
*09:49.220- 09:55.240* :  The televised announcement ended a five-day period of reflection that Mr Sánchez took
*09:55.240- 10:01.260* :  following the launch of a corruption investigation directed at his wife. The inquiry followed a
*10:01.260- 10:07.120* :  complaint from the pressure group known as Manos limpias or clean hands. Mr Sánchez called the
*10:07.120- 10:13.440* :  allegations a harassment campaign orchestrated by right-wing media. Our correspondent in Madrid,
*10:13.440- 10:19.640* :  Guy Hegeco, told us more about what led to this period of reflection. Last Wednesday it was
*10:19.640- 10:24.380* :  revealed that a judge was investigating these allegations against the wife of Pedro Sánchez,
*10:24.380- 10:32.520* :  begon your gourmet, for alleged influence peddling with regard to the awarding of government money
*10:32.520- 10:38.640* :  to companies during the Covid pandemic in the form of rescue packages. The allegation was that
*10:38.640- 10:43.400* :  somehow begon your gourmet had influenced in the awarding of these contracts and that she had
*10:43.400- 10:49.360* :  contacts with the beneficiaries of them. Very soon after it was revealed that this investigation
*10:49.460- 10:53.960* :  was going to take place, Mr Sánchez made his announcement that he was going to take several days
*10:53.960- 10:59.740* :  off, cancel his engagements and consider resigning. He said he needed the time off to think about
*10:59.740- 11:05.380* :  his future. So for the last five days we've had this sort of hiatus in Spanish politics where the
*11:05.380- 11:10.360* :  Prime Minister has not been seen in public. There's been all this uncertainty. Many people
*11:10.360- 11:14.880* :  believing that he was going to resign today, at certain times it did look like he would,
*11:14.880- 11:18.740* :  but of course in the end he didn't. And how much of a surprise was that?
*11:18.740- 11:25.420* :  I think it was a big surprise. This morning for example it was revealed that Mr Sánchez had met
*11:25.420- 11:32.060* :  with King Felipe before he made his announcement. And when that news came out, I think a lot of
*11:32.060- 11:36.900* :  people thought well the only reason he would meet with King Felipe would be to announce his decision
*11:37.340- 11:42.660* :  to resign. There's no other decision that would merit a meeting like that. However that turned out
*11:42.660- 11:50.060* :  not to be the case. And so it was a surprise. I think many within the socialist party were
*11:50.860- 11:56.500* :  genuinely worried that he was going to resign. Over the weekend there were lots of demonstrations
*11:56.500- 12:01.900* :  both here in Madrid and in many other parts of the country in support of Mr Sánchez. He said
*12:01.900- 12:08.220* :  that those influenced his decision to stay. That was Guy Hegeco in Spain. Well another leader who
*12:08.220- 12:14.220* :  has been reflecting on his future is the Scottish First Minister Hamza Yusaf. But unlike Pedro
*12:14.220- 12:20.320* :  Sánchez Mr Yusaf has decided to go. He told a news conference in Edinburgh that he's stepping down
*12:20.320- 12:25.760* :  as First Minister and the leader of the Scottish National Party once a successor is chosen.
*12:25.760- 12:31.460* :  Hamza Yusaf became emotional at the end of his statement as he looked at his wife sitting in the
*12:31.460- 12:40.220* :  front row. I am an absolute date. Through my wonderful wife, my beautiful children and my wider
*12:40.300- 12:44.760* :  family. For putting up with me over the years, I'm afraid you'll be seeing a lot more of me
*12:45.280- 12:52.840* :  from now. You are truly everything to me. And although of course, as you can tell, I am sad that
*12:52.840- 13:01.580* :  my time as First Minister is ending. But I am so grateful and so blessed for having the opportunity
*13:01.740- 13:09.540* :  that afforded to solve you, to lead my country. Mr Yusaf's decision follows the collapse of a
*13:09.540- 13:14.940* :  power-sharing deal. He'd only been imposed for just over a year. So how did it come to this?
*13:15.240- 13:19.740* :  A question from our political correspondent, Rob Watson. Well, people would say on a personal
*13:19.740- 13:25.020* :  level it's because he's a much nicer guy than he has a good politician. But more to the point,
*13:25.020- 13:30.620* :  it's come to this because essentially the pro-independence Scottish National Party was in coalition
*13:31.280- 13:35.900* :  with the also pro-independence green party. They both favor independence, they're minority
*13:37.120- 13:40.960* :  government. And he had essentially tried to separate. He had broken the agreement with them
*13:40.960- 13:46.240* :  because he wanted the Scottish government to focus less on issues of environment and gender
*13:46.380- 13:51.300* :  and much more on economics because that agenda was not proving very popular with the Scottish
*13:51.300- 13:58.140* :  voters. And so what next for the Scottish nationalists and more broadly for Scottish politics?
*13:58.140- 14:03.760* :  What happens next? Well, what happens next is they have 28 days to find a new First Minister,
*14:03.760- 14:08.800* :  but I think you raised the big question, which is what happens next in British and Scottish politics.
*14:09.420- 14:13.360* :  And it's a big question because the Scottish National Party has utterly dominated
*14:13.360- 14:19.900* :  Scottish politics since 2007. So one is asking, is this a moment that that will perhaps mark
*14:19.900- 14:25.260* :  further decline in their popularity or is there a moment at which they turn it round? And why
*14:25.260- 14:30.200* :  that matters, of course, is that while support for independence is not the same thing as support
*14:30.200- 14:36.760* :  for the Scottish National Party, if the SMP continues to struggle, if it continues to decline
*14:36.760- 14:42.020* :  in popularity, clearly that would make independence like clear and a sort of knock on effect in why
*14:42.020- 14:47.960* :  the British politics Jackie would be that if the SMP struggles in Scotland, well, the main opposition
*14:47.960- 14:53.020* :  Labour Party would be rubbing its hands together thinking, ah-ha, maybe can we can win some seats
*14:53.020- 14:58.840* :  here and make it easier for us to beat the Conservatives? We heard what an emotional speech it was
*14:59.760- 15:04.860* :  in that resignation statement. He talked about being a Muslim and the UK Prime Minister being a
*15:04.860- 15:12.060* :  Hindu. He said that he had never dreamt of leading his country as a boy. What did you make of all that?
*15:13.180- 15:18.420* :  Well, having been in the room when he was elected a year ago and having, of course, been around
*15:18.420- 15:24.660* :  for the resignation and speeches of many politicians, it made me think that politicians often
*15:24.660- 15:30.760* :  find their truest voices in the moment of defeat and of leaving office. And the second thought I
*15:30.760- 15:35.580* :  had was about multiculturalism, which he talked about in Britain, and you might say it's a sort of
*15:35.580- 15:39.680* :  testament to way things are going and Britain that people don't actually think it was that remarkable
*15:39.680- 15:44.840* :  that we have a Hindu Prime Minister and formally had a Muslim First Minister of Scotland. You know,
*15:44.840- 15:48.300* :  many people would see that as great progress. That was Rob Watson.
*15:51.140- 15:57.240* :  Still to come in this podcast. We've had at least 24 tornadoes and there's a lot of recovery
*15:57.240- 16:03.580* :  and still some rescue going on. The aftermath of deadly tornadoes in the Central United States.

*17:35.200- 17:39.000* :  City of Patna, encouraging more women to cost their vote.
*17:47.780- 17:52.180* :  These group of women are dressed in intricately designed,
*17:52.180- 17:58.740* :  sorry, very colorful. They have jewelry on, brimillion in their hair. They look like they may be
*17:58.740- 18:05.880* :  going to a party, but they're actually going door-to-door encouraging people to get out and vote
*18:05.880- 18:14.600* :  in these elections. They're making sure ID cards are in hand and up to date.
*18:17.440- 18:22.480* :  Geetan Jali has been leading this merry band of women as they go door-to-door.
*18:23.520- 18:30.940* :  Each vote is very important for us. If one person doesn't vote, then their voice will not be
*18:30.940- 18:37.000* :  represented. That's why we take it upon ourselves to educate all women that voting is your duty,
*18:37.000- 18:43.640* :  your responsibility as a citizen of India. We are doing this to get as many women out to vote as
*18:45.080- 18:47.660* :  possible, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.
*18:51.980- 18:57.740* :  We will go stand in the QF 6am, and on our way back to voting, we will encourage others to.
*18:59.320- 19:03.680* :  Yes, that's what you need to do. Vote, amic others vote to.
*19:12.080- 19:17.200* :  Geetan Jali walks hand in hand with another woman, humming a Hindi song as she approaches the next
*19:17.200- 19:24.000* :  house. Not even the oppressive heat will deter these women. India is in the middle of a heat way.
*19:24.000- 19:34.540* :  It's already 42 degrees Celsius. Women make up 471 million eligible voters in this election.
*19:35.120- 19:41.560* :  That's the equivalent of the combined populations of the US, the UK, and France.
*19:42.760- 19:49.620* :  Not only do women represent a massive voting block, they consistently vote. In the 2019 elections,
*19:50.220- 19:53.340* :  the no voter turnout equaled male voter turnout.
*19:57.900- 20:05.780* :  The democratic process in India is a festive occasion full of colour and a firm belief that every vote
*20:05.780- 20:13.280* :  matters. Samira has saying in India, clean up operations are taking place in the central
*20:13.280- 20:19.860* :  United States after dozens of tornadoes ripped through towns. Four people were killed in Oklahoma
*20:19.860- 20:26.060* :  and a man in Iowa has died from his injuries. President Joe Biden has offered the Oklahoma
*20:26.060- 20:31.880* :  State Government full federal government support, as more severe storms are forecast for the month
*20:31.880- 20:34.060* :  of May. Ella Bicknell reports.
*20:44.180- 20:49.660* :  It started on Friday, more than 70 tornadoes reported most in Nebraska and Iowa.
*20:50.160- 20:55.160* :  Then they spread southwards. A separate weather system brought 35 more twisters to Oklahoma and
*20:55.160- 21:01.420* :  North Texas on Saturday, with gusts of more than 200 kilometres per hour. At least four people have
*21:01.420- 21:06.960* :  died, one of them, a four-month-old baby, another hundred people were injured. Authorities continue
*21:06.960- 21:11.620* :  to search for casualties. Doug Schberger is from the National Weather Service in Oklahoma.
*21:12.180- 21:18.860* :  And in our area of responsibility, we've had at least 24 tornadoes that occurred on Saturday
*21:18.860- 21:26.580* :  and early Sunday morning. Our situation today is basically we are doing some damage survey
*21:27.380- 21:32.200* :  and there's a lot of recovery and still some rescue going on.
*21:32.200- 21:37.800* :  The storms left a trail of destruction, flattening buildings and sharing the roofs of some homes.
*21:37.800- 21:43.360* :  Cars were lifted off the ground, footage shows a postal truck suspended on the wreckage of a tree,
*21:43.360- 21:49.600* :  and 35,000 homes have been without power. One of the worst hit spots was Solfer, a town in
*21:49.600- 21:55.560* :  South Central Oklahoma. The state's governor Kevin Stitz says he was shot by the scale of devastation
*21:55.560- 22:01.440* :  there. It's unbelievable. Just like that, all the tax revenue, all these businesses in downtown
*22:01.440- 22:07.640* :  Solfer just overnight have been wiped out, so we need to help Solfer rebuild.
*22:08.100- 22:13.720* :  Governor Stitz has now declared a 30-day state of emergency to accelerate aid to the 12 hardest
*22:13.720- 22:18.140* :  hit counties. He thanked President Biden who offered federal government support,
*22:18.140- 22:23.380* :  and that might prove crucial, with more tornadoes expected in the next month.
*22:23.680- 22:29.620* :  We are just kind of starting our severe weather season here. Definitely have got off to a
*22:29.620- 22:35.780* :  running start, and I anticipate that we more than likely will see more tornadoes in May.
*22:36.500- 22:42.340* :  We just hope that when they do occur, they don't affect communities as strongly as we saw here
*22:42.340- 22:47.540* :  this weekend. Meteorologist Doug Spager ending that report by Ella Bicknell.
*22:48.580- 22:54.040* :  Artists from 37 countries have started to arrive in Sweden to prepare for the Eurovision
*22:54.040- 23:00.400* :  Song Contest, which kicks off next week. Eurovision is the world's largest live music event,
*23:00.400- 23:06.680* :  and is watched by more than 160 million people around the world. The event this year is controversial,
*23:06.680- 23:13.400* :  especially in the host city of Malmer, which has a high Muslim population. Many protests are planned
*23:13.400- 23:18.740* :  over Israel's participation. Rob Young spoke to Daniel Rosny, who's in Malmer.
*23:19.400- 23:23.840* :  There are adverts everywhere you go around the city, promoting Eurovision. Some say welcome back
*23:23.840- 23:29.900* :  to Malmer, because the Song Contest was here 11 years ago. But on top of pretty much every sign I've
*23:29.900- 23:35.160* :  seen, there are stickers that say things like, which land with Palestine or Boycott Eurovision.
*23:35.580- 23:40.700* :  This city has a very high Muslim population, up to a third of people who live here are Muslim,
*23:41.200- 23:46.820* :  and there are protests every weekend that have been since October, so there are expected to be
*23:46.820- 23:52.000* :  some confrontations as international fans start to arrive, and also the artists.
*23:52.640- 23:54.460* :  Right, so there could be trouble, could there?
*23:55.220- 24:01.300* :  There could, and more than 100,000 fans are expected in the city. There are 160 million who
*24:01.300- 24:07.600* :  watch Eurovision. How 37 countries take part. I think some people might find it hard to believe
*24:07.600- 24:11.440* :  that there will be trouble, because most people associate Eurovision with joy, but events have
*24:11.440- 24:14.780* :  been scaled back in the city as a result of security threats.
*24:15.080- 24:19.040* :  And you've been at one of the demonstrations, have you, to see what people are saying?
*24:19.560- 24:24.620* :  Yes, I was at one yesterday. There was roughly around 2,000 people at them. There are two huge
*24:25.460- 24:28.140* :  demonstrations next week, but this is what one woman had to say to me.
*24:30.240- 24:35.960* :  My name is Nora Christensen, and I'm from Sweden, Malmer. I don't understand how it's possible
*24:35.960- 24:42.580* :  for them to be participating when they were so fast to remove Russia from the contest. And
*24:42.580- 24:48.720* :  isn't even in the Euro, so I don't know why they are participating. As an after all, I don't
*24:48.720- 24:54.660* :  understand it. It makes you angry. It makes me very, very angry and sad that they make
*24:54.660- 24:59.880* :  difference between people and people. When it was the Ukraine who was in war, it was okay,
*24:59.880- 25:03.620* :  everybody was behind them, but when it's the Palestinian, nobody's behind them. We are just
*25:03.620- 25:08.660* :  watching everything. Eurovision organizers say the situations are completely different.
*25:09.240- 25:14.040* :  She is right. Russia was banned from competing when it invaded Ukraine, but that was after
*25:14.040- 25:18.120* :  international sanctions and officials that run the Eurovision Song Contest, the European
*25:18.120- 25:22.740* :  Broadcasting Union. They said that the Russian Broadcaster was breaking in partiality rules.
*25:23.280- 25:27.720* :  In regards to Israel taking part this year, the EBU insists this is a competition for
*25:27.720- 25:33.260* :  broadcasters and not governments. That was Daniel Rosni in Sweden. And we'll end this edition
*25:33.260- 25:38.300* :  of the Global News Podcast by returning to Gaza. International journalists haven't been
*25:38.300- 25:43.920* :  allowed in freely since the Hamas attack on Israel on October the 7th, so covering the impact
*25:43.920- 25:49.120* :  of the war on local people has fallen to Palestinian journalists who have reported from inside
*25:49.120- 25:55.400* :  Gaza. They have faced extraordinary risks on a daily basis. Among them are colleague Adnan
*25:55.400- 26:01.820* :  or Bush. He kept a video diary documenting the war in Gaza, while also keeping his family,
*26:01.820- 26:08.320* :  his colleagues and himself safe. This is Adnan's story, told by BBC Arabic Stahlia Heider.
*26:12.740- 26:19.440* :  It's October 9th. Jabalia in northern Gaza is being bombed. Adnan is covering the story for BBC
*26:22.580- 26:27.420* :  Arabic. Adnan was born and raised in the district and still lives there with his wife and children.
*26:34.300- 26:40.040* :  I was just there that day. Ten minutes after leaving the place it was completely destroyed.
*26:41.160- 26:47.860* :  October 12th, an Israeli strike on a tower block kills dozens. Adnan and his team head to the
*26:47.860- 26:56.640* :  local Ashifah Hospital. Standing among the dead and injured, Adnan's cameraman breaks down in
*26:56.640- 27:03.040* :  tears. One of his closest friends is lying on a stretcher, covered in severe burns.
*27:07.620- 27:14.080* :  The scene was horrible. The number of dead I saw was not normal. You feel that the danger has
*27:14.080- 27:23.000* :  reached you, your neighborhood, your friends. October 13th, Israeli planes dropped thousands of
*27:23.000- 27:27.540* :  leaflets telling civilians they will be safer if they move to the south of the Gaza Strip.
*27:28.280- 27:35.220* :  They fall like confetti across the city. I felt the message was threatening,
*27:36.280- 27:42.260* :  a threat to me personally and a threat to everyone around. You will all be killed.
*27:42.980- 27:47.960* :  The Israeli military told us they encourage civilian evacuation using radio broadcasts,
*27:48.040- 27:52.400* :  a dedicated Arabic website, millions of phone calls and leaflets.
*27:54.880- 27:59.460* :  Along with tens of thousands of other Gazans, Adnan makes the decision to leave,
*28:00.380- 28:03.780* :  a personal exodus and a professional story to cover.
*28:09.340- 28:14.840* :  October 16th, Adnan and his family find an apartment in Hanyunis in the south of this trip,
*28:15.280- 28:19.220* :  but have to evacuate after being told the building is a target.
*28:19.220- 28:25.660* :  Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip has continued. The Kitari News Network Al-Jazirah
*28:25.860- 28:30.520* :  said the family of its correspondent was killed in a strike on a refugee camp.
*28:30.820- 28:36.920* :  October 25th, an Israeli missile attack killed several members of Al-Jazirah's Wa'el-Dahduh's family.
*28:37.920- 28:41.800* :  Adnan and Wa'el have been friends and colleagues for more than 20 years.
*28:42.780- 28:47.020* :  That night, Adnan wakes up in his sleep, his face wet with tears.
*28:50.520- 28:56.660* :  I was confused. I asked myself, is this a direct attack against Wa'el-Dahduh?
*28:56.880- 29:01.080* :  His family were bombed in the same area. My family were in.
*29:01.880- 29:05.620* :  When reporting on the attack, Adnan's emotions get the better of him.
*29:06.460- 29:09.880* :  Live on TV, his tolls and starts to cry.
*29:12.180- 29:12.780* :  You know.
*29:16.860- 29:21.160* :  The Israeli military told us they take all operationally feasible measures to mitigate
*29:21.160- 29:27.220* :  harming civilians, including journalists. They say they have never and will never deliberately
*29:27.220- 29:35.420* :  target journalists. On February 10th, Adnan has given permission to leave Gaza.
*29:36.100- 29:39.800* :  After nearly four months covering the war, he leaves to join his family,
*29:40.340- 29:43.120* :  who were evacuated several weeks before him.
*29:45.580- 29:51.440* :  In Gaza now, people are eating grass, while I'm here eating in a clean hotel.
*29:52.080- 29:56.780* :  When I eat this food, it tastes like poison. I can't eat it.
*29:57.540- 30:02.300* :  My first and last choice is Gaza. I must go back.
*30:02.800- 30:05.640* :  But when will it all end? No one knows.
*30:32.920- 30:37.580* :  This edition was mixed by Volodymyr Muzechka. The producer was Anna Murphy.
*30:37.980- 30:42.320* :  Our editor is Karen Martin. I'm Jackie Leonard and until next time, goodbye.
*30:52.960- 30:57.660* :  I'm Katya Adler from the Global Story podcast and we're looking at this summer's Paris
*30:57.660- 31:02.580* :  Olympics and Paralympics. Hosting the games put a lot of pressure on the city.
*31:02.580- 31:06.840* :  This means hosting isn't quite as appealing as it once used to be.
*31:07.360- 31:11.420* :  The Global Story brings you fresh takes and smart perspectives from BBC Journalists
*31:11.500- 31:15.100* :  around the world. Find us wherever you get to your BBC podcasts.
