*01:11.180- 01:15.160* :  I'm Alex Ritson, and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday,
*01:15.160- 01:17.940* :  the 2nd of April, these are our main stories.
*01:18.600- 01:21.160* :  Israel says it's conducting a thorough investigation

*01:45.940- 01:48.440* :  is coming to be an important factor
*01:48.440- 01:51.120* :  in the forthcoming South African election.
*01:51.380- 01:54.380* :  It would be offensive to not even speak about the reality
*01:54.380- 01:57.600* :  of what it does to our public systems, what it does
*01:57.940- 01:59.120* :  when people don't pay taxes,
*01:59.440- 02:01.620* :  but they expect to live and benefit
*02:01.620- 02:04.180* :  of the good and services that our government provides.
*02:04.560- 02:07.880* :  And the new shirts of the German National Football Team
*02:08.260- 02:09.120* :  caused quite a stir.
*02:13.500- 02:16.300* :  On Monday, Gaza's Hamas run Health Ministry
*02:16.300- 02:18.580* :  released its latest casualty figures
*02:18.580- 02:22.100* :  from the ongoing Israeli military action in the territory.
*02:22.640- 02:23.220* :  It was huge.
*02:23.220- 02:28.600* :  32,845, many of them, women and children.
*02:28.600- 02:32.080* :  The news went virtually unremarked by the world's media.
*02:32.420- 02:34.540* :  Today, though, a very different response
*02:34.540- 02:36.300* :  after the same Health Ministry
*02:36.300- 02:38.480* :  said that an Israeli air strike had killed
*02:38.480- 02:41.680* :  four foreign aid workers and their Palestinian driver.
*02:42.040- 02:44.560* :  In all, seven workers from the U.S.-based
*02:44.560- 02:46.740* :  charity World Central Kitchen were killed.
*02:47.280- 02:49.180* :  One of them was a young Australian woman,
*02:49.480- 02:50.340* :  Zumi Frankham.
*02:50.640- 02:53.760* :  This was the reaction of the Australian Prime Minister
*02:53.760- 02:54.940* :  Anthony Albanese.
*02:55.420- 03:01.260* :  The truth is that this is beyond any reasonable
*03:01.260- 03:06.060* :  circumstance that someone going about providing aid
*03:06.060- 03:10.240* :  and humanitarian assistance should lose their life.
*03:10.880- 03:15.020* :  And there were four aid workers as well as
*03:15.500- 03:17.560* :  Palestinian driver in this vehicle.
*03:18.720- 03:22.180* :  This is a human tragedy that should never have occurred
*03:22.740- 03:24.700* :  that is completely unacceptable.
*03:25.360- 03:28.780* :  Poland, Britain and Spain also lost nationals in the attack
*03:28.780- 03:31.820* :  and have added their voices to calls for an urgent explanation
*03:31.820- 03:34.500* :  with the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez,
*03:34.860- 03:36.300* :  condemning the strikers brutal.
*03:36.300- 03:39.660* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now
*03:39.660- 03:42.600* :  admitted that IDF forces unintentionally,
*03:42.600- 03:45.220* :  in his words, killed the aid workers.
*03:45.720- 03:49.120* :  Earlier, the IDF spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Haggari,
*03:49.120- 03:50.020* :  had this to say.
*03:50.620- 03:52.260* :  We have been reviewing the incident
*03:52.260- 03:55.540* :  in the highest levels to understand the circumstances
*03:55.540- 03:58.480* :  of what happened and how it happened.
*03:59.820- 04:04.360* :  We will be opening a probe to examine this serious incident further.
*04:05.100- 04:08.860* :  This will help us reduce the risk of such an event
*04:08.860- 04:09.920* :  from occurring again.
*04:10.640- 04:13.280* :  I got the latest on what we now know happened
*04:13.280- 04:16.100* :  from our correspondent in Israel, Yolanda Nell.
*04:16.500- 04:20.080* :  Apparently, they have been in a convoy of three cars,
*04:20.080- 04:21.200* :  two of them armored.
*04:21.580- 04:23.960* :  You can see in photographs that they clearly have
*04:23.960- 04:26.760* :  the World Central Kitchen logo on their roofs.
*04:27.220- 04:28.920* :  And the organization says,
*04:28.920- 04:31.740* :  despite coordinated movements with the IDF,
*04:31.940- 04:36.000* :  the convoy was hit as it was leaving a warehouse in Dura Balach,
*04:36.040- 04:37.880* :  which is in the center of the Gaza Strip.
*04:37.880- 04:41.560* :  This is where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of food aid,
*04:41.920- 04:43.960* :  brought to Gaza along the maritime route.
*04:44.000- 04:46.080* :  And yesterday, we did see the ships,
*04:46.080- 04:49.880* :  the second time that this maritime route had been used,
*04:49.880- 04:52.480* :  opened up from Cyprus into Gaza
*04:52.900- 04:55.800* :  with World Central Kitchen paying a lead role in that.
*04:56.120- 04:58.040* :  It seems that aid arrived in the evening
*04:58.040- 05:01.580* :  and this team was very much involved in the storage of that
*05:01.580- 05:03.080* :  aid for later distribution.
*05:03.480- 05:05.940* :  The CEO of the organization, Aaron Gore,
*05:05.940- 05:08.660* :  has said it's an attack on humanitarian organizations
*05:08.740- 05:11.100* :  showing up in the most dire of situations
*05:11.100- 05:13.400* :  where food is being used as a weapon of war.
*05:13.460- 05:14.880* :  This is unforgivable.
*05:15.340- 05:18.040* :  The Israeli military hasn't confirmed it carried out the strike.
*05:18.200- 05:20.260* :  It says it's carrying out an in-depth examination
*05:20.260- 05:22.660* :  at the highest levels to understand the circumstances
*05:23.260- 05:24.440* :  of this tragic incident.
*05:24.440- 05:27.640* :  It says it makes extensive efforts to enable the safe delivery
*05:27.640- 05:30.240* :  of humanitarian aid and has been working closely
*05:30.240- 05:32.400* :  with World Central Kitchen in their vital efforts
*05:32.400- 05:35.660* :  to provide food and humanitarian assistance to people in Gaza.
*05:35.860- 05:38.460* :  I've just been in touch with the head of Aneera,
*05:38.460- 05:41.460* :  which is another organization that works with World Central Kitchen
*05:41.800- 05:45.800* :  in order to distribute food and says that along with World Central Kitchen
*05:45.800- 05:48.200* :  they are now pausing their operations in Gaza.
*05:48.720- 05:51.960* :  This will have a huge impact in a place where the UN is warning
*05:51.960- 05:53.440* :  of a man-made famine looming.
*05:53.860- 05:58.000* :  Together, those two organizations provide some 2 million meals a week
*05:58.420- 05:59.540* :  for people in Gaza.
*05:59.780- 06:03.420* :  You heard that clip of the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese,
*06:04.240- 06:07.880* :  to be expected perhaps, but also how significant are those remarks
*06:07.880- 06:11.340* :  from within the Israeli political establishment?
*06:11.400- 06:14.360* :  Is this going to increase the pressure yet further
*06:14.600- 06:15.920* :  on Benjamin Netanyahu?
*06:16.220- 06:18.380* :  I mean, certainly, I think when it comes to this issue
*06:18.860- 06:23.260* :  about humanitarian aid, something that the US has been consistently demanding
*06:23.680- 06:25.580* :  and with just so many nationalities involved,
*06:25.580- 06:28.320* :  I think there's going to be, through the day, more and more comments
*06:28.320- 06:29.980* :  about what has happened here.
*06:30.280- 06:32.640* :  Already, we heard from the US National Security Council
*06:32.640- 06:36.040* :  spoke to women saying we're heartbroken, deeply troubled by the strike
*06:36.040- 06:40.100* :  that killed these aid workers in Gaza, humanitarian aid workers must be protected
*06:40.100- 06:42.140* :  as they deliver aid that's desperately needed,
*06:42.140- 06:45.000* :  and we urge Israel to swiftly investigate what happened.
*06:45.200- 06:48.720* :  And away from this immediate tragedy, what's happening in Raffa?
*06:48.760- 06:53.000* :  Are the Israelis still talking of launching a full-scale ground invasion?
*06:53.280- 06:57.560* :  The last we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu speaking on Sunday,
*06:57.560- 07:00.820* :  he was adamant that this operation would go ahead
*07:01.220- 07:05.780* :  and that it was necessary in order to achieve victory against Hamas in Gaza.
*07:05.780- 07:08.700* :  It's something that he has been sticking to consistently.
*07:08.700- 07:13.900* :  The ongoing international concern is about the humanitarian implications of such an operation,
*07:13.900- 07:18.400* :  but the indications that we're given in recent days is that that plan from Israel
*07:18.400- 07:22.000* :  to go ahead with that after the Muslim holiday of Ada Fitter,
*07:22.000- 07:25.160* :  which follows Ramadan coming up in the next week or so.
*07:25.360- 07:29.260* :  So I think there's a lot of pressure from those who want to prevent Israel
*07:29.260- 07:32.900* :  from having that full-scale operation to use this time for negotiations.
*07:33.500- 07:35.320* :  Yo Land, Nell, in Jerusalem.
*07:36.360- 07:38.560* :  In our earlier podcast, we brought you the news
*07:38.600- 07:42.820* :  that is suspected Israeli air strike in the Syrian capital Damascus
*07:42.820- 07:46.720* :  had killed two senior commanders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.
*07:47.160- 07:52.160* :  Iranian state media now says that 13 people are confirmed to have been killed in the attack
*07:52.160- 07:55.300* :  on the Iranian consulate. Israel has not commented.
*07:55.300- 07:59.740* :  Iran's foreign ministry says it was a breach of all international conventions.
*07:59.740- 08:04.320* :  It sparked fresh concerns that the conflict in Gaza could spiral
*08:04.840- 08:06.380* :  into a regional conflagration.
*08:06.880- 08:09.480* :  I asked our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Asher,
*08:09.780- 08:12.720* :  if there was any doubt that Israel was responsible.
*08:13.560- 08:14.920* :  No, I don't think there is, as you say,
*08:14.920- 08:18.740* :  customary Israel doesn't make any official comment on these sorts of operations,
*08:18.820- 08:22.640* :  but they've been carrying them out in Syria for years during the conflict
*08:22.640- 08:25.160* :  that's on Iranian linked targets Iran,
*08:25.920- 08:29.860* :  as I'm sure distance will be very much aware of, has played a very big role
*08:29.860- 08:31.860* :  in keeping President Asher in power there.
*08:32.260- 08:35.280* :  It's military advisers who come directly from a revolutionary guards
*08:36.020- 08:39.800* :  have provided the kind of know-how that has kept President Asher
*08:39.800- 08:46.080* :  able to stay in power and defeat the rebels of Jihadists who rose up against him.
*08:46.480- 08:50.760* :  This follows that pattern, which we've seen intensify since,
*08:50.760- 08:53.740* :  October the 7th, since the war erupted between Israel and Hamas,
*08:54.140- 08:58.740* :  when Iranian proxies have carried out more attacks on Israeli linked
*08:59.080- 09:02.560* :  and US linked targets in Israel's responded in kind.
*09:02.560- 09:07.860* :  So I don't think there's any doubt that Israel's carried this particular attack out.
*09:08.060- 09:12.460* :  So what have the Iranians been saying and what are their options for retaliation?
*09:12.660- 09:15.720* :  I mean, we talked about this again and again, you know, another escalation.
*09:15.780- 09:20.600* :  I mean, this is a serious one in that this was essentially a consulate building
*09:21.060- 09:23.560* :  that supposedly, as Iran has been very quick to point out,
*09:23.560- 09:25.300* :  protected under international law.
*09:26.160- 09:30.820* :  These at least two, one commander in particular, are very senior figures
*09:31.560- 09:32.880* :  within the revolutionary guards.
*09:32.880- 09:37.520* :  So this is really hitting at the heart of the Iranian military establishment.
*09:37.520- 09:40.880* :  13 people is now the latest figure Iranian state media has given.
*09:41.360- 09:45.040* :  So we've had the strong rhetoric, one would expect President Reisi
*09:45.440- 09:47.420* :  of Iran who said this will not go unanswered.
*09:47.620- 09:51.220* :  The Iranian foreign minister has said this is a breach of all international norms.
*09:51.680- 09:55.500* :  There will be an answer, but it's how calibrated that answer will be.
*09:55.680- 09:58.260* :  Is this about to spiral out of control into something bigger?
*09:58.500- 10:01.880* :  Every time something like this happens, that's the obvious question to ask.
*10:02.160- 10:03.320* :  It's not in Iran's interests.
*10:03.320- 10:07.460* :  I mean, that's clear to have a direct all-out confrontation either with Israel
*10:07.460- 10:09.880* :  or the US, which would inevitably follow.
*10:10.260- 10:14.920* :  It doesn't have the military capability to face off against that,
*10:14.920- 10:18.060* :  and it could mean the complete collapse of the Iranian regime.
*10:18.060- 10:19.620* :  It's ruled the country since 79.
*10:20.480- 10:23.240* :  But it's proxies, which we see, obviously,
*10:23.240- 10:28.360* :  Hasbullah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, in Iraq, etc., and in Syria,
*10:28.980- 10:31.100* :  as well, have been intensifying their attacks.
*10:31.100- 10:34.540* :  Now, it's whether a response can be sufficiently stepped up by Iran
*10:34.940- 10:36.720* :  to show how seriously they're taking this,
*10:37.000- 10:40.320* :  and how much they see if they should still provide a deterrent to Israel,
*10:40.660- 10:41.880* :  how far they go with that.
*10:42.260- 10:46.160* :  And all the time, visit a gamble that Israel, in this instance,
*10:46.160- 10:47.820* :  is playing, as you say,
*10:48.200- 10:51.220* :  whether this could unintentionally cross the red lines
*10:51.220- 10:53.320* :  and descend into a conflagration.
*10:56.240- 10:59.240* :  After a remarkable couple of weeks in Senegal,
*10:59.240- 11:00.560* :  there's a new man at the top.
*11:00.960- 11:04.440* :  Bassirou Jomifi has been sworn in as president.
*11:17.480- 11:21.440* :  At 44, he becomes Africa's youngest elected head of state,
*11:21.460- 11:24.300* :  but his path to power was far from straightforward.
*11:24.300- 11:28.260* :  Just over two weeks ago, Mr. Fai was languishing in jail,
*11:28.260- 11:32.760* :  detained without trial on charges, including inciting insurrection.
*11:33.180- 11:36.180* :  The lead up to the election was also marred by violent protests
*11:36.180- 11:38.960* :  after the outgoing president, Makisal,
*11:39.320- 11:41.480* :  tried to delay the vote until the end of the year,
*11:41.800- 11:43.840* :  but many are hopeful for the future.
*11:45.820- 11:48.040* :  Up to here has been difficult.
*11:48.040- 11:51.580* :  Lots of people died, and there's been lots of clashes as well.
*11:51.760- 11:56.580* :  But God made the best decision because Fai is now the president.
*11:56.580- 11:59.140* :  I just hope that he won't disappoint us.
*11:59.600- 12:01.860* :  Our Africa original editor, Richard Hamilton,
*12:01.860- 12:05.120* :  told me a little more about the incoming president.
*12:05.660- 12:08.920* :  Up until a few weeks ago, very few people had heard of him.
*12:08.920- 12:10.640* :  He's a former tax collector,
*12:11.100- 12:13.340* :  described as modest and methodical,
*12:13.340- 12:15.460* :  as he would be if you were a tax collector.
*12:15.820- 12:19.700* :  His nickname, Mr. Clean, because he promises to clear up corruption.
*12:19.700- 12:22.220* :  He was interviewed back in 2019,
*12:22.220- 12:25.340* :  and he said it never crossed his mind to get into politics.
*12:25.340- 12:29.120* :  So even he's a bit surprised to be where he is today.
*12:29.120- 12:32.080* :  And he has perhaps a lack of experience.
*12:32.080- 12:34.300* :  He's never been a politician before.
*12:34.760- 12:40.460* :  And foreign investors are slightly worried about the radical left rhetoric and promises.
*12:40.460- 12:43.320* :  He says he will renegotiate oil, gas,
*12:43.320- 12:45.620* :  and fisheries contracts with foreign companies.
*12:46.060- 12:49.660* :  He'd also said he would drop the currency that's tied to the French,
*12:49.660- 12:51.680* :  Frank, the CFA, Frank.
*12:52.300- 12:56.140* :  And he's promised to create jobs amongst the youth
*12:56.140- 12:58.680* :  and strengthen the judiciary as well.
*12:59.240- 13:01.720* :  So quite an amazing route to the top.
*13:01.720- 13:05.040* :  And an extraordinary fortnight leading up to today.
*13:05.840- 13:09.280* :  That's right. I mean, it's been a world when turn around.
*13:09.440- 13:12.000* :  Elections were supposed to be held in February,
*13:12.060- 13:18.600* :  and then the outgoing President Mackie Sal tried to postpone the vote until December.
*13:18.600- 13:22.560* :  This provoked outrage, protests amongst the young population.
*13:22.560- 13:26.860* :  Mr. Fye and his colleague, Osmond Sonker, were in prison.
*13:26.860- 13:29.920* :  Those charges were widely seen as trumped up.
*13:30.320- 13:34.300* :  And so Mr. Fye, when he was released, had just over one week to campaign,
*13:34.460- 13:38.680* :  the constitutional court had ruled that Mackie Sal could not postpone the vote.
*13:38.680- 13:42.800* :  So Senegal came back from the brink. It's a remarkable story,
*13:43.380- 13:46.620* :  especially amongst all the military coups in West Africa,
*13:46.620- 13:49.080* :  like Burkina Faso, Marley in Niger.
*13:49.800- 13:52.960* :  And it really was a triumph for Senegal's civil society,
*13:53.620- 13:56.740* :  the judiciary, journalists, and the young population.
*13:56.820- 13:59.460* :  They stood up to autocracy, and they won.
*13:59.520- 14:03.960* :  And the elections were held successfully and peacefully on the 24th of March.
*14:04.260- 14:05.240* :  There was a high turnout.
*14:05.240- 14:07.200* :  So it was a remarkable story.
*14:07.200- 14:11.040* :  And Senegal had been a beacon of democracy, and now it is again.
*14:11.760- 14:14.620* :  And Mr. Fye has quite a lot of big things in his interest.
*14:14.620- 14:15.520* :  He takes over.
*14:15.820- 14:17.440* :  Exactly. It's a long list.
*14:17.440- 14:22.340* :  The main thing is youth unemployment, poverty, migration to Europe,
*14:22.820- 14:24.920* :  corruption, and the cost of living.
*14:24.920- 14:26.640* :  So a lot on his plate.
*14:27.280- 14:28.040* :  Richard Hamilton.
*14:29.240- 14:34.420* :  Hundreds more people have been arrested in Biela Rousse as the government continues its campaign
*14:34.420- 14:39.820* :  against anyone accused of involvement in the pro-democracy demonstrations of 2020.
*14:39.820- 14:44.340* :  Biela Rousse has more political prisoners than any other country in Europe,
*14:44.340- 14:47.060* :  including Russia, and many of them are women.
*14:47.060- 14:49.660* :  It's difficult for people to speak openly there,
*14:49.660- 14:52.900* :  but many Belarusians have now left for nearby countries.
*14:53.400- 14:55.160* :  Monica Whitlock has been to meet them,
*14:55.160- 15:00.640* :  speaking first to Jojenja, who offers practical support to female political prisoners
*15:01.080- 15:02.180* :  in her home country.
*15:05.760- 15:08.820* :  Top of the list, the most essential is thermal underwear.
*15:09.780- 15:13.000* :  If you have thermal underwear that you can wear under your tights,
*15:13.440- 15:15.160* :  then you have a chance of staying warm.
*15:18.180- 15:24.240* :  Good warm tights, socks, good quality socks that climbers use or army socks.
*15:25.140- 15:26.400* :  They ask for good mittens.
*15:27.060- 15:30.900* :  The mittens should also have four layers, because they are always outside,
*15:32.060- 15:32.160* :  always.
*15:33.200- 15:36.100* :  Closing can only be sent to a prisoner once a year.
*15:38.720- 15:40.200* :  Jojenja feels safer now.
*15:40.920- 15:43.500* :  She's left her home in Belarus and made it to Poland,
*15:44.000- 15:46.020* :  a neighboring country but a world away.
*15:46.920- 15:51.680* :  She gathers life essentials and sends them to women political prisoners back home.
*15:52.480- 15:56.640* :  There are more than 1400 documented political prisoners in Belarus.
*15:57.300- 16:00.720* :  Well, comparing to Russia, if you use this comparison in Russia,
*16:00.720- 16:02.800* :  it's way lower than in Belarus.
*16:03.100- 16:05.160* :  Incomparable, incomparable.
*16:06.460- 16:08.080* :  My name is Inna Kabalyonak.
*16:08.580- 16:14.100* :  I run an organization called Polyzek Mi, supporting Belarusian political prisoners.
*16:14.780- 16:15.840* :  It's important to understand.
*16:15.840- 16:20.760* :  People are going to penal colony for liking a post on Facebook, on Telegram, whatever.
*16:21.540- 16:25.760* :  And on the other hand, it's getting more and more dangerous to speak out about it.
*16:30.100- 16:32.500* :  The arrest began back in the summer of 2020,
*16:33.040- 16:36.560* :  when Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in the presidential elections.
*16:37.700- 16:40.140* :  So many people felt cheated of their vote,
*16:40.660- 16:42.820* :  that they filled the streets of the capital, minns,
*16:42.840- 16:45.580* :  and other towns and cities, calling for him to go.
*16:46.220- 16:49.300* :  So I was covering all these sewells from the ground.
*16:50.000- 16:53.580* :  Olga Leica, seasoned reporter at Tutby Y,
*16:54.040- 16:57.160* :  one of the biggest independent news websites in Belarus.
*16:57.740- 17:03.380* :  The huge demonstration against Lukashenko, it was something unbelievable.
*17:04.660- 17:06.840* :  There are 400,000 people.
*17:13.440- 17:17.260* :  A lot of people were detained, a lot of people were seriously beaten.
*17:18.620- 17:20.820* :  Olga and her colleagues were arrested, too.
*17:20.820- 17:22.840* :  She spent almost a year in prison.
*17:23.420- 17:27.980* :  Their news website Tutby Y has been declared a terrorist formation,
*17:28.820- 17:31.220* :  all independent media are now banned.
*17:32.280- 17:34.980* :  It's hard to speak directly to people in South Belarus,
*17:35.840- 17:38.920* :  but those who stay in touch report a wave of new arrests,
*17:39.760- 17:43.960* :  including of those who donated to charities, trying to help the prisoners.
*17:44.560- 17:48.480* :  All people who donate, for any purpose, now they are in danger.
*17:48.960- 17:49.700* :  The prisoners are country.
*17:50.160- 17:52.240* :  And including if they've donated in the past?
*17:53.000- 17:53.340* :  For sure.
*17:54.160- 17:56.780* :  The repression has never stopped since 2020.
*17:56.780- 18:02.840* :  In a sense, the government's techniques have developed and become more sophisticated over time.
*18:03.480- 18:09.760* :  Fake accounts, for example, are asking people to join fake groups mostly on telegram,
*18:09.760- 18:12.960* :  because telegram played a huge role in connecting people back in 2020.
*18:13.560- 18:16.920* :  And creating fake accounts so that people will reveal themselves,
*18:16.980- 18:18.840* :  because they do not know who they're talking to.
*18:19.860- 18:24.360* :  Or just asking people to make likes or comments.
*18:25.200- 18:28.300* :  Some people are still being caught relatively easy,
*18:28.980- 18:31.020* :  because you cannot be afraid all the time.
*18:31.600- 18:36.160* :  At some point, you will forget to clear all your telegram bots,
*18:36.160- 18:39.960* :  all the chats, all the conversations, all the cyber hygiene at some point.
*18:40.620- 18:42.800* :  So it's new life, it's new Belarus.
*18:43.560- 18:48.020* :  First it was possible, it was possible to tell your opinion, to write something,
*18:48.420- 18:49.260* :  to ask questions.
*18:49.560- 18:53.800* :  And now you can do nothing, and it's new normality.
*18:54.840- 18:57.900* :  But you know, all the repressions have the end.
*18:58.340- 19:01.260* :  So let's wait, let's try to survive.
*19:02.380- 19:05.600* :  Olga Loiko ending that report by Monica Whitlock.
*19:06.440- 19:11.220* :  According to Singapore has convicted the first person in what has become the city state's
*19:11.260- 19:13.240* :  biggest ever money laundering case.
*19:13.620- 19:17.680* :  Sue Wen Kang is one of 10 Chinese people accused in the case
*19:18.160- 19:22.820* :  that has led to more than two billion dollars of assets being seized or frozen.
*19:23.280- 19:25.960* :  Our business reporter Katie Silver has the details.
*19:26.800- 19:30.380* :  Last August, police simultaneously conducted a large-scale
*19:30.380- 19:32.440* :  island-wide raid across Singapore,
*19:32.460- 19:36.600* :  seizing about three-quarters of billion dollars in cars, watches,
*19:36.600- 19:41.340* :  luxury apartments, gold bars, designer handbags, wine and cash.
*19:41.740- 19:46.100* :  10 people were arrested, all originally from China's southern Fujian province,
*19:46.100- 19:50.020* :  accused of laundering through Singapore money, which they made overseas,
*19:50.020- 19:52.640* :  through scams and online illegal gambling.
*19:53.340- 19:57.080* :  In total, more than two billion dollars of assets has been seized or frozen
*19:57.580- 19:58.860* :  in the high profile case.
*19:59.080- 20:04.820* :  The court today sentenced Mr. Sue to 13 months in prison after he admitted to 11 charges,
*20:05.400- 20:07.880* :  court proceedings against the other accused are continuing.
*20:07.900- 20:13.760* :  Singapore's police said it will take swift firm action to keep the country's financial system clean.
*20:13.760- 20:17.000* :  The city state's reputation has taken a hit recently,
*20:17.000- 20:22.220* :  following both this case and a corruption scandal involving a former Cabinet Minister.
*20:22.760- 20:23.360* :  Katie Silver.
*20:26.140- 20:27.820* :  Still to come in this podcast,
*20:27.820- 20:33.860* :  a former Justice Minister is in the sights of China's official anti-corruption investigators.
*20:43.120- 20:47.100* :  The information spaces we inhabit can resemble a whole of mirrors.
*20:47.100- 20:50.900* :  It's called guided democracy or managed democracy.
*20:51.120- 20:53.000* :  There are different parties, different candidates,
*20:53.000- 20:56.000* :  but everyone knows who is going to win.
*20:56.080- 20:59.320* :  The Global Jigsaw is the podcast helping you make sense of them.
*20:59.620- 21:02.360* :  We've seen a crackdown on the opposition.
*21:02.380- 21:04.180* :  We've seen an increase in censorship.
*21:04.640- 21:07.320* :  That's the Global Jigsaw from the BBC World Service.
*21:07.320- 21:09.920* :  Listen now by searching for the explanation
*21:09.960- 21:11.880* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*21:18.380- 21:21.520* :  A high level conference is taking place in the Hague today
*21:21.520- 21:23.920* :  called Restoring Justice for Ukraine.
*21:23.920- 21:29.000* :  The meeting is dealing with efforts to provide justice for victims of the Russian invasion.
*21:29.000- 21:33.920* :  The event is co-organised by the Netherlands, Ukraine and European Commission.
*21:33.920- 21:36.460* :  The Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Demetro Calabra,
*21:36.820- 21:38.040* :  will be attending the meeting.
*21:38.220- 21:41.620* :  Victoria Owenkunda asked our correspondent in the Hague,
*21:41.900- 21:44.640* :  Anna Holigen, what the delegates were hoping to achieve.
*21:45.240- 21:46.300* :  Well, this is really interesting,
*21:46.380- 21:50.320* :  because there is a kind of broad agreement among countries
*21:50.320- 21:57.080* :  supportive of Ukraine for the need for some kind of restorative justice for the victims,
*21:57.660- 22:02.080* :  but there is this kind of wrangling over how that should be conducted.
*22:02.080- 22:06.740* :  So there is already a mechanism in place for investigating the alleged crimes,
*22:06.740- 22:10.940* :  things like murder, rape, war crimes, crimes against humanity,
*22:10.940- 22:15.840* :  targeting allegedly hospitals, schools, power plants.
*22:16.640- 22:18.460* :  And so there is an investigation underway.
*22:18.460- 22:20.520* :  There is evidence gathering.
*22:20.520- 22:22.620* :  There is evidence preservation.
*22:23.460- 22:28.520* :  But there is no tribunal to actually deal with the crime of aggression,
*22:28.520- 22:32.280* :  so that in this context is the invasion itself.
*22:32.280- 22:34.360* :  The ICC doesn't have the power to do that,
*22:34.360- 22:36.840* :  because Russia is not a member of the ICC.
*22:36.840- 22:40.780* :  So that's the real crux of what the foreign and justice ministers
*22:40.780- 22:43.160* :  will be discussing here in the Hague today.
*22:43.520- 22:46.420* :  But if we're looking at the complexity of this war,
*22:46.600- 22:48.940* :  and you talk about evidence gathering,
*22:49.740- 22:50.700* :  investigations are ongoing,
*22:51.220- 22:53.460* :  how difficult or what challenges have there been,
*22:53.460- 22:55.320* :  because there will still be a lot,
*22:55.320- 22:57.280* :  there will still be a known at this moment.
*22:57.700- 23:02.300* :  I mean, this has been a conflict where detectives have been deployed almost
*23:02.300- 23:04.180* :  since the beginning of the invasion.
*23:04.420- 23:06.420* :  And throughout the last two years,
*23:06.420- 23:08.540* :  we've been speaking to those involved,
*23:08.540- 23:11.260* :  and the ICC is involved in those investigations.
*23:11.280- 23:15.120* :  The Netherlands has sent forensic teams together evidence,
*23:15.160- 23:18.900* :  but the problem is that the issue of double jeopardy,
*23:18.920- 23:22.280* :  so the ICC has already issued an arrest warrant
*23:22.280- 23:26.660* :  for President Putin accusing him of illegally transferring children
*23:26.660- 23:27.940* :  from Ukraine and to Russia.
*23:28.520- 23:31.540* :  And if there is another tribunal, a special tribunal,
*23:31.800- 23:33.080* :  then there are concerns.
*23:33.720- 23:35.660* :  They have to work in tandem and parallel
*23:35.660- 23:37.520* :  with each other rather than in competition.
*23:37.660- 23:40.520* :  So that's one of the issues that has to be ironed out
*23:40.540- 23:41.760* :  by these ministers today.
*23:42.080- 23:46.000* :  So recently, the Polish Prime Minister Donutusk said that Europe,
*23:46.000- 23:47.100* :  and I'm quoting what he said,
*23:47.140- 23:48.620* :  is in a pre-war era,
*23:49.000- 23:51.860* :  and that Ukraine must not be defeated by Russia.
*23:52.460- 23:54.800* :  How does that play in when we look at the support,
*23:54.800- 23:58.220* :  militarily support that Ukraine has been getting from its allies?
*23:58.780- 24:01.140* :  We'll hear a lot more about that over the coming days
*24:01.480- 24:02.560* :  with the NATO summit.
*24:02.740- 24:03.880* :  And here in the Netherlands,
*24:03.880- 24:06.240* :  they have, from the beginning, been determined
*24:06.300- 24:08.840* :  that there should be support provided.
*24:08.840- 24:11.360* :  And the Netherlands has been one of the strongest allies
*24:11.360- 24:13.660* :  in encouraging other countries in the European Commission
*24:13.700- 24:15.760* :  to continue providing that kind of support.
*24:15.760- 24:18.940* :  But this today is really focusing on the legality.
*24:19.060- 24:21.120* :  So they'll be talking about the possibility
*24:21.120- 24:22.400* :  of an ad hoc tribunal,
*24:22.400- 24:26.080* :  something probably along the lines of the Yugoslav tribunal,
*24:26.080- 24:28.120* :  the Kosovo specialist chambers,
*24:28.740- 24:31.100* :  but also compensation for the victims too,
*24:31.300- 24:34.860* :  and possibly the use of frozen Russian assets
*24:35.460- 24:38.580* :  in order to help rebuild those devastated cities.
*24:39.640- 24:41.180* :  Amaholegan in the hake.
*24:41.980- 24:44.180* :  The Chinese Communist Party's corruption,
*24:44.180- 24:47.240* :  Watchdog says it's placed a former Justice Minister
*24:47.240- 24:51.020* :  under investigation for serious violations of party rules.
*24:51.020- 24:54.560* :  With the details, here's our Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Hatton.
*24:55.100- 24:57.500* :  The former Justice Minister, Tang Yijun,
*24:57.500- 25:01.300* :  was once touted as a rising star in the ruling Communist Party.
*25:01.820- 25:03.080* :  He was believed to be close
*25:03.080- 25:05.220* :  with the country's powerful leader,
*25:05.220- 25:08.820* :  Cidinping, and he ascended quickly through the party's ranks,
*25:08.820- 25:11.340* :  becoming Justice Minister in 2020,
*25:11.340- 25:13.960* :  a position he held for three years.
*25:14.660- 25:17.060* :  News that Mr. Tang has now at the center
*25:17.060- 25:19.200* :  of a serious corruption investigation
*25:19.720- 25:22.060* :  might seem like an odd repetition of history
*25:22.060- 25:23.780* :  for those inside China.
*25:24.240- 25:27.200* :  His predecessor, as Justice Minister Fujonghua,
*25:27.700- 25:30.500* :  was handed a suspended death sentence two years ago
*25:30.940- 25:31.900* :  after being found guilty
*25:31.900- 25:35.580* :  of accepting more than $17 million in bribes.
*25:36.380- 25:38.300* :  More than two million Communist officials
*25:38.300- 25:42.100* :  have been disciplined under China's ongoing anti-corruption campaign,
*25:42.100- 25:46.380* :  which was unveiled when Cidinping came to power more than a decade ago.
*25:46.900- 25:48.940* :  He had promised to catch both tigers,
*25:48.940- 25:50.320* :  high-ranking officials,
*25:50.760- 25:52.520* :  and flies, local officials
*25:52.920- 25:54.380* :  who were breaking the party's rules.
*25:55.200- 25:59.120* :  Some have been asking why Cidinping's corruption crackdown
*25:59.600- 26:03.080* :  doesn't seem to be stopping party officials from committing crimes,
*26:03.100- 26:06.780* :  since top officials who've been appointed in Xi's time
*26:07.200- 26:09.900* :  have been caught for serious violations of the rules,
*26:10.200- 26:11.880* :  including bribery and embezzlement.
*26:12.480- 26:14.780* :  Those questions will only be amplified
*26:14.780- 26:17.360* :  with the news of Mr. Tang's investigation,
*26:17.360- 26:23.280* :  who himself had served as Mr. Xi's anti-corruption chief in the early 2000s
*26:23.500- 26:25.920* :  when Cidinping was a provincial governor.
*26:26.480- 26:27.320* :  Celia Hatton.
*26:27.760- 26:32.180* :  Rising anger over illegal immigration is dominating the political agenda
*26:32.180- 26:35.140* :  in the run-up to South Africa's election in May.
*26:35.520- 26:38.460* :  The government claims its tightening security on its border,
*26:38.680- 26:42.200* :  but the BBC has travelled to the busiest crossing post
*26:42.200- 26:46.940* :  and, close by, witnessed migrants coming over the border unchallenged.
*26:47.200- 26:50.080* :  Jenny Hill sent this report from the town of Messina.
*26:52.740- 26:55.980* :  Under a blazing sun, the donkeys toss their heads
*26:56.380- 27:00.960* :  as they drag cart loads of goods across the dried-out bed of the Limpopo River.
*27:02.980- 27:05.320* :  This is South Africa's border with Zimbabwe,
*27:05.940- 27:09.080* :  but there are no guards, no barriers, no checks.
*27:12.320- 27:15.340* :  Nearby, the metal remains of a border fence glint,
*27:15.760- 27:17.000* :  trampled in the undergrowth.
*27:17.720- 27:20.660* :  It's a way in for those seeking a better life in South Africa,
*27:21.360- 27:25.200* :  but it's lawless, an easy target for smugglers and traffickers.
*27:25.780- 27:28.680* :  People here say that it's when they get into the bush
*27:29.020- 27:31.260* :  that the journey becomes particularly dangerous.
*27:31.260- 27:35.060* :  There are gangs of criminals in there they say waiting to attack
*27:35.720- 27:39.220* :  stories of theft, rape, even killings.
*27:43.160- 27:47.920* :  And the migrants who make it to the nearest town of Messina tell terrible stories.
*27:48.540- 27:52.300* :  I'll be feeling like I want to cry, I'll be feeling like thinking too much of my situation.
*27:53.120- 27:56.900* :  The men who raped Portia could see she was visibly pregnant.
*27:56.940- 28:00.020* :  There's a large jagged scar on her forearm.
*28:00.080- 28:03.260* :  She told us they attacked her with glass bottles too.
*28:03.860- 28:05.860* :  When they tried to sleep somewhere with the town,
*28:06.520- 28:09.360* :  I see those students, I see what those men did, and not me.
*28:12.620- 28:17.980* :  Messina is a chaotic border town, home to countless undocumented migrants.
*28:18.980- 28:26.300* :  There's a weariness about the men who return to this compound of tin huts every day as night falls.
*28:26.660- 28:29.040* :  The lucky ones will have found a bit of work in town,
*28:29.320- 28:33.240* :  and perhaps a little cash to send to their families back home.
*28:39.120- 28:44.100* :  No one, not even the South African government knows how many people have slipped into this country
*28:44.560- 28:45.300* :  and planned to stay.
*28:45.480- 28:48.700* :  Talenda tells us he can't go back to Zimbabwe.
*28:49.140- 28:52.220* :  There is nothing there, we are starving, there is no fun, there is whatever,
*28:52.900- 28:53.900* :  and everything is expensive.
*28:57.240- 28:59.600* :  South Africa wants to take back control.
*29:00.220- 29:03.380* :  It's training up new recruits to defend the border.
*29:03.760- 29:07.340* :  I can show you now that the current leadership of the country
*29:08.000- 29:09.600* :  understands the criticality of this way.
*29:09.760- 29:13.020* :  But even the head of the recently formed border management authority,
*29:13.020- 29:16.760* :  Mike Masiapato admits it's going to take time.
*29:17.120- 29:19.800* :  Hopefully in the next few years we should be able to succeed.
*29:19.800- 29:29.200* :  South Africa's ruling party, the ANC, may not have years,
*29:29.900- 29:30.920* :  and elections coming.
*29:30.920- 29:35.660* :  And while in Masina's marketplace elicit cross-border traders flourishing,
*29:36.280- 29:37.260* :  this country is not.
*29:37.260- 29:40.200* :  The ANC, which has been in power for 30 years,
*29:40.200- 29:45.160* :  presides over failing infrastructure and record levels of crime and unemployment.
*29:45.200- 29:48.660* :  Illegal immigration is one of our biggest issues in South Africa.
*29:48.980- 29:52.620* :  Malaybo Kobe is a regional spokeswoman for Action SA,
*29:52.620- 29:57.720* :  one of the many political parties hoping to challenge the ANC's majority.
*29:57.720- 30:03.500* :  It would be offensive to not even speak about the reality of what it does to our public systems,
*30:03.500- 30:05.840* :  what it does when people don't pay taxes,
*30:06.180- 30:10.840* :  but they expect to live and benefit of the goods and services that our government provides.
*30:15.980- 30:21.020* :  At the riverbank crossing, the exchange of people and goods continues unchecked.
*30:21.600- 30:25.600* :  Even as South Africa prepares perhaps to redraw its political map,
*30:26.280- 30:30.540* :  need and desperation continue to define this country's limits.
*30:32.860- 30:36.120* :  Jenny Hill in the far north of South Africa.
*30:37.040- 30:40.320* :  Football fans around the world are counting down to the euros,
*30:40.320- 30:43.980* :  which kick off in Germany in a little over two months' time.
*30:43.980- 30:46.980* :  But now, the hosts are embroiled in scandal.
*30:47.320- 30:47.520* :  Why?
*30:47.520- 30:51.980* :  It's all because of the numbering on the back of the famous white kits,
*30:51.980- 30:55.040* :  which is said to be similar to Nazi insignia.
*30:55.460- 31:00.580* :  So now, the maker Adidas is taking action when the Erkut is following the story.
*31:04.380- 31:10.500* :  Diehard Football fans wait with baited breath for the new home and away shirts to be revealed each season.
*31:10.920- 31:13.500* :  They're highly collectible and fly off the shelves,
*31:13.840- 31:16.820* :  despite costing around $150 each.
*31:17.680- 31:20.980* :  The new German home kit, which is white with black lettering,
*31:20.980- 31:26.020* :  and has flashes of black red and yellow on the shoulders to represent the national flag,
*31:26.480- 31:30.680* :  was worn by the German team in a friendly match against France last month.
*31:31.660- 31:35.980* :  Fans love to customise the shirts with the number of their favourite player,
*31:36.280- 31:40.640* :  but there's been a huge backlash over shirts with the number 44,
*31:40.640- 31:47.140* :  which critics say resembles the logo of the Nazi party's notorious SS paramilitary units,
*31:47.140- 31:53.840* :  who were responsible for killing millions of Jews in Europe before and during the Second World War.
*31:53.840- 32:00.860* :  The federation has tweeted that none of the parties involved saw any proximity to Nazi symbolism
*32:00.860- 32:06.740* :  during the development process of the jersey's design and vowed to develop an alternative design
*32:06.740- 32:13.240* :  for the number four. Adidas spokesperson Oliver Bruggen says the names and numbers on the shirts
*32:13.240- 32:17.340* :  were designed by the federation in conjunction with 11 team sports,
*32:17.340- 32:22.980* :  and insists that any resemblance to Nazi symbols was completely unintentional.
*32:23.340- 32:27.680* :  German fans are now banned from choosing the number 44 for shirts,
*32:28.280- 32:34.180* :  and any shirts bearing that number have been removed from the shelves and are no longer in production.
*32:34.980- 32:39.660* :  The scandal over the German shirts comes less than a week after the German football
*32:39.660- 32:45.840* :  federation's announcement that Nike will replace Adidas as the official supplier of team shirts
*32:46.400- 32:47.580* :  from 2027.
*33:32.500- 33:36.460* :  The information spaces we inhabit can resemble a whole of mirrors.
*33:36.460- 33:41.480* :  It's called guided democracy or managed democracy. There are different parties,
*33:41.480- 33:45.380* :  different candidates, but everyone knows who is going to win.
*33:45.460- 33:48.700* :  The Global Jigsaw is the podcast helping you make sense of them.
*33:49.000- 33:53.540* :  We've seen a crackdown on the opposition, we've seen an increase in censorship.
