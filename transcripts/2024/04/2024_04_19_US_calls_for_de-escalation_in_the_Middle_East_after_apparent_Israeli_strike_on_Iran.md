*01:18.780- 01:21.520* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.240- 01:26.880* :  I'm Mick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 19th of April,
*01:27.320- 01:31.420* :  these are our main stories. Tensions rise yet again between Israel and Tehran,
*01:31.420- 01:34.980* :  as explosions are reported at an Iranian military base.
*01:35.440- 01:39.640* :  Ukraine says it has for the first time shut down one of the Russian strategic bombers
*01:39.640- 01:45.180* :  that have been tormenting its cities. The top four runners in Beijing's half marathon have
*01:45.180- 01:50.540* :  been stripped of their prizes after a race that saw aphics from Africa let a Chinese
*01:50.540- 01:58.000* :  competitor win. Also in this podcast we hear about efforts to reunite families decades
*01:58.000- 02:00.080* :  after the Civil War in El Salvador.
*02:00.360- 02:07.300* :  The continuous separation of families becomes a fracture in society if people don't have their own
*02:07.300- 02:10.620* :  peace then society has a whole cannot achieve peace.
*02:16.840- 02:21.640* :  Following an apparent airstrike near a military base in Iran early on Friday,
*02:21.640- 02:27.140* :  world leaders are calling for restraint. It seems that the attack on the central province of
*02:27.140- 02:32.600* :  Isfahan was the response Tehran was expecting after its major missile and drone attack
*02:32.600- 02:38.220* :  on Israel at the weekend. US officials have said that Israel was responsible for today's
*02:38.220- 02:43.200* :  explosions near a military base, although Israel itself hasn't given official confirmation.
*02:44.140- 02:49.100* :  At a meeting of the G7 in Capri, Italy's foreign minister was asked whether the US
*02:49.100- 02:54.920* :  knew about the reported Israeli strike on Iran. Antonio Tajiani said the US government
*02:54.920- 03:00.780* :  was informed at the very last minute by Israel about the attack and states there was no involvement
*03:00.780- 03:07.120* :  from Washington. Antonio Tajiani said the goal was now ensuring the situation doesn't escalate
*03:07.120- 03:16.980* :  further. I wanted a very clear message to come out from the whole of the G7. The political
*03:16.980- 03:24.220* :  goal of the G7 is de-escalation. We invite all parties to work to avoid any escalation.
*03:24.800- 03:30.380* :  After a news conference at the same G7 meeting, the UN Secretary of State Anthony Blinken
*03:30.380- 03:35.380* :  was asked whether Washington was given advance warning that Israel was launching an attack on Iran.
*03:35.860- 03:39.260* :  I'm not going to speak to that except to say that the United States has not been involved
*03:39.760- 03:46.160* :  in any offensive operations. What we're focused on, what the G7 is focused on, is our work to
*03:46.160- 03:53.740* :  de-escalate tensions, to de-escalate from any potential conflict. You saw Israel on the
*03:53.740- 04:00.240* :  receiving end of an unprecedented attack, but our focus has been on, of course, making sure that
*04:00.440- 04:06.900* :  Israel can effectively defend itself, but also de-escalating tensions, avoiding conflict,
*04:06.900- 04:12.000* :  and that remains our focus. I asked Majid Afshar from the BBC Persian
*04:12.000- 04:17.580* :  Service what we know about today's attacks. We don't know exactly what the extent was, but
*04:17.580- 04:25.180* :  loud explosions were heard in the cities of Tabriz and Isfahan in early hours of this morning.
*04:25.180- 04:30.200* :  At four o'clock in the morning, people said they could hear the air defense system
*04:30.780- 04:37.280* :  near Isfahan, which is close to the international airport as well, has been activated. And later on,
*04:37.280- 04:43.200* :  this was confirmed by official reports that the loud explosions was the result of the activation
*04:43.280- 04:49.780* :  of the air defense system. They said that they had down three drones, as they say, small drones.
*04:50.300- 04:57.300* :  And later on, they denied there was any sound of explosion in Tabriz, but now the
*04:57.300- 05:04.560* :  governor has confirmed that the air defense system was activated in Tabriz in north-west of the
*05:04.560- 05:10.700* :  country as well. These are the main two cities where the main air defense systems, along with
*05:10.700- 05:17.560* :  Hamadan and Tehran, are located. Now, the concern around the world really has been that an escalation
*05:17.560- 05:23.360* :  could be caused by this tick for tat, if you like, between the two countries. What's been the
*05:23.360- 05:29.540* :  official reaction? The facts and the effort by the Iranian media and by the Iranian military
*05:29.540- 05:37.960* :  officials so far to downplay the incident tells us that they are trying to somehow convince the
*05:37.960- 05:44.860* :  public that this was a failure and there was no attack. A senior official has now told a number
*05:44.860- 05:52.100* :  of news agencies that this was not an attack, even if it was something, it was an infiltration.
*05:52.100- 05:58.540* :  So there is no plan for retaliation. We know that both sides were trying to restore deterrence,
*05:58.860- 06:02.220* :  so by downplaying this incident, maybe they can achieve that goal.
*06:02.620- 06:07.020* :  It's strange, isn't it? Because on the one hand, you're saying that, but also Iran's president,
*06:07.020- 06:11.960* :  Abraham Reyesi, within the last couple of days, said he vowed that the tiniest invasion by Israel
*06:11.960- 06:18.880* :  would bring a massive and harsh response. It's perhaps saying one thing to the local population
*06:18.880- 06:23.980* :  and from what you're saying, other people are saying other things for the international community.
*06:24.320- 06:30.200* :  That's in one way correct, but at the same time, there have been a lot of talks,
*06:30.200- 06:37.620* :  private channels between the Americans, Iranians, and through mediatories on how this attack
*06:38.140- 06:42.060* :  could look like over the past couple of days. There have been considerations.
*06:42.060- 06:50.600* :  And I think with what has happened now, and if we agree with the fact that this was an
*06:50.600- 06:55.300* :  airstrike, and based on what the Israeli officials have told Washington Post,
*06:56.000- 07:00.860* :  this was a message to the Iranians and the Iranians seem to have received the message.
*07:01.440- 07:03.800* :  Imagine Afshar from the BBC Persian service.
*07:04.840- 07:09.040* :  So what's the reaction being in Israel? You'll now know our correspondent in Jerusalem
*07:09.040- 07:10.200* :  gave us this update.
*07:10.580- 07:14.640* :  First of all, we don't have official confirmation from the Israeli military of any offensive in Iran,
*07:14.780- 07:21.080* :  but Israeli media are reporting this as an Israeli strike. The US media quoting
*07:21.720- 07:25.680* :  Israeli and US officials confirming that, and that's been widely picked up on here.
*07:26.200- 07:32.160* :  I mean, one reported quote was saying that the aim was to signal to Iran that Israel does have
*07:32.160- 07:36.540* :  this capability to strike in the heart of the country. This is a central province,
*07:36.540- 07:42.080* :  as for Han, of course. There are reports of explosions near to this key military base,
*07:42.080- 07:48.260* :  and it's already been remarked on that Israel wanted to respond like for like to what happened
*07:48.300- 07:54.600* :  with the unprecedented Iranian direct attack last weekend. It could go for military bases,
*07:54.600- 08:01.320* :  because really with 99% of the drones and missiles intercepted and downed,
*08:01.560- 08:07.380* :  the only few really that got through that we know about, some of those hit the never-team
*08:07.380- 08:13.200* :  air base, a sensitive Israeli military site in the Southern Negave Desert, and of course,
*08:13.200- 08:20.440* :  it's for Han by hitting there. Israel is saying that it can get close to the nuclear facilities
*08:20.440- 08:26.360* :  that are located in that province. The key one, the Natan's uranium enrichment plant,
*08:26.360- 08:30.720* :  although we've had Iran making clear the international atomic energy agency making clear
*08:31.180- 08:34.920* :  that these nuclear sites were not affected, it still sends a message.
*08:35.680- 08:39.460* :  You'll am now in Jerusalem. Our international editor, Jeremy Bowen,
*08:39.460- 08:44.760* :  gave us his assessment of how Western leaders calls for de-escalation are being received in the
*08:44.760- 08:49.740* :  Middle East. Well, everyone's calling for a strength, actually, about this pretty much accept
*08:50.380- 08:54.700* :  for no-down hardliners in Iran, and there are a few hardliners in Israel as well.
*08:55.320- 08:59.940* :  It's in my big envy, the security minister, the national security minister in Israel,
*09:01.140- 09:07.760* :  who said after the initial last Saturday, the Iranian response to that Israeli air strike,
*09:08.600- 09:15.720* :  he said then that Israel should go berserk, and his one word this morning was
*09:16.620- 09:20.180* :  feeble or useless, something like that that is a translation of the e-brew.
*09:23.500- 09:28.820* :  As well as their more serious characters too, inside the Israeli war cabinet, there are
*09:29.700- 09:38.840* :  retired generals, Messes Gans and Eisenkot, who wanted to have a fierce response pretty quickly
*09:39.380- 09:45.200* :  to all of this, because for these railings, showing that they are able to deter their enemies is
*09:45.240- 09:50.380* :  enough for them. Biden and others have been trying to persuade them, but they have effectively
*09:50.380- 09:56.840* :  deterred them by dealing with that large Iranian attack, albeit with the help of powerful Western
*09:56.840- 10:03.500* :  allies, notably the United States. And so I think that if Israel doesn't
*10:03.780- 10:11.040* :  love any more missiles in the direction of Iran, then I think that this probably will draw a line
*10:11.040- 10:17.580* :  under the epist or the fact that the Middle East is still in absolute turmoil.
*10:18.300- 10:24.100* :  Jeremy Bowen. A few weeks after the death of the Russian opposition leader and chief Kremlin
*10:24.100- 10:30.020* :  critic Alexei Navalny, one of his closest aides was repeatedly attacked with a hammer near his
*10:30.020- 10:36.420* :  home in exile. Leonard Volkov, who was Alexei Navalny's chief of staff, lives in Lithuania.
*10:36.840- 10:41.280* :  Now, two people have been arrested in Poland on suspicion of carrying out that attack.
*10:41.340- 10:45.140* :  For more, we spoke to our regional editor, Danny Eibard.
*10:45.440- 10:51.500* :  The attack happened on the 12th of March in Vilnius, so some people have broke the window of
*10:51.500- 10:56.000* :  Leonard Volkov's car, and they sprayed him with tear gas, and then they beat him with a hammer.
*10:56.180- 11:02.260* :  He was badly wounded on the leg, but it wasn't broken. But his arm was broken in that attack,
*11:02.260- 11:07.800* :  and he also got bruising to the face. And this all happened, of course, just days before the
*11:07.800- 11:13.340* :  presidential election in Russia. He called it against a greeting from President Putin.
*11:13.540- 11:18.500* :  Now, this man, oh, these men, rather, have been arrested in Poland. What are people saying in
*11:18.500- 11:23.320* :  Lithuania about this? Well, the arrest were initially announced by the Lithuanian president,
*11:23.320- 11:29.940* :  Gitanis Nowsada, and it's a clear, important development for Lithuania, given that the attack
*11:29.940- 11:34.940* :  happened on its soil. One of the things that Mr. Nowsada said was he told the organizers,
*11:35.420- 11:40.560* :  it was a warning from Lithuania and Poland not to repeat such attacks. He didn't blame
*11:40.560- 11:45.620* :  President Putin, but the Lithuanian intelligence services have said that that is the line of thinking.
*11:45.860- 11:52.080* :  Meanwhile, Mr. Volkov, what's he been saying about this and who he believes was responsible for the
*11:52.080- 11:58.780* :  attack? He has thanked the security services in both Poland and Lithuania, and he also, he said
*11:58.780- 12:04.960* :  it's important to investigate and expose what he called the chain of command there. So that's
*12:05.120- 12:10.580* :  right from the man who hit him with a hammer all the way up, as I said, to President Putin,
*12:10.580- 12:16.360* :  who he blames for the attack. So the Kremlin, of course, would dismiss such allegations,
*12:16.360- 12:23.320* :  but the Lenin Volkov, as Alexei Navalny's chief of staff, is a constant and persistent thorn
*12:23.320- 12:29.140* :  in their side. And the election itself, the Russian presidential election, you could see a video
*12:29.140- 12:34.900* :  of a live broadcast of Mr. Volkov with his arm in a sling. So he went straight back to work and
*12:34.900- 12:40.260* :  was trying to encourage people to turn out for a noon protest in memory of Alexei Navalny
*12:40.260- 12:48.000* :  during that presidential election. Danny Eberhard. Ukraine's military says it shot down a long-range
*12:48.000- 12:55.020* :  Russian strategic bomber used to fire cruise missiles against it. Moscow said a bomber had crashed
*12:55.020- 12:59.920* :  in southern Russia after a combat mission. James Wardhouse is in the Ukrainian capital.
*13:00.320- 13:04.960* :  Kiev says the Tupelev bomber was on its way back from dropping missiles on Ukraine.
*13:04.960- 13:10.520* :  Fussage online appears to show the aircraft falling from the sky with its distinctive wide
*13:10.520- 13:15.660* :  wingspan visible. Ukraine officials say the bomber's downing was part of a special operation
*13:15.660- 13:21.060* :  between the country's Air Force and intelligence service. For Ukraine, it was a night when Russia
*13:21.060- 13:27.680* :  reportedly launched 22 missiles and 14 drones. Voting is underway in elections in India,
*13:27.680- 13:33.720* :  the world's largest democracy, where almost 1 billion people are eligible to cast their vote.
*13:34.420- 13:39.600* :  Because of India's vast size, voting is split into seven phases spread over the next six weeks.
*13:40.180- 13:43.860* :  Our South Asia correspondent Samira Hussein, who's in New Delhi, told us more.
*13:44.580- 13:51.580* :  It is absolutely massive. We're talking about almost 970 million eligible voters. So voting
*13:51.580- 13:57.980* :  actually has to take place in seven phases over the next six weeks. And so just today,
*13:57.980- 14:07.600* :  there are 166 million eligible voters. That is the combined populations of France and the UK,
*14:07.600- 14:12.840* :  and then some. So I think that just gives you the sense and the scale. And what they've done is
*14:12.840- 14:18.600* :  that they have 21 different, or there is voting taking place in 21 different states across the country.
*14:19.000- 14:24.620* :  And part of the reason what makes voting here just such a big monumental task is not only
*14:25.100- 14:30.000* :  the size of the population, but it's also the size of the country and the diversity within
*14:30.000- 14:36.680* :  the country. And because in according to Indian law, you cannot be more than two kilometers away
*14:36.680- 14:42.260* :  from a polling booth. So you're in a situation in which you have electoral officials that are
*14:42.260- 14:50.360* :  traveling five hours, sometimes on animals, to be able to take a voting machine to one resident,
*14:50.360- 14:54.560* :  perhaps in a remote area in a forest. Samira Hutsay.
*14:57.080- 15:03.320* :  Still to come in this podcast, Taylor Swift has surprised fans by releasing a secret double album
*15:03.320- 15:08.700* :  with 15 new songs laid in with references to her love life. There's basically a Taylor Swift
*15:08.700- 15:12.300* :  industrial complex at this point. There will be thousands of articles published today working out
*15:12.340- 15:13.140* :  songs you're about.

*15:50.820- 15:57.320* :  We've heard of Charlie Chaplin, right? Well, Charlie Chaplin was my grandfather and there was a time
*15:57.320- 16:03.340* :  when he was the biggest star in all the world. But something happened, not just to him,
*16:04.040- 16:09.380* :  but to hundreds of artists in Hollywood. They were forced to leave, forced out.
*16:10.420- 16:15.900* :  All episodes of Hollywood Exiles from the BBC World Service and CBC are available now.

*16:27.900- 16:34.040* :  Every few years, the El Niño weather for Nominan brings dramatic change to weather in many parts
*16:34.040- 16:38.900* :  of the world. The most recent occurrence of this has caused problems across the Pacific region
*16:38.900- 16:45.200* :  and beyond. After months of disrupted weather, a few days ago Australia announced that the El Niño
*16:45.200- 16:51.060* :  weather event has now ended whilst in India, it's weakened to what it called a neutral stage.
*16:51.700- 16:56.040* :  But what exactly is El Niño? Our environment correspondent Matt McGraw explains.
*16:56.820- 17:02.140* :  So El Niño is a naturally occurring climate phenomenon that sees warm water come to the
*17:02.140- 17:07.220* :  surface of the Pacific Ocean, the eastern Pacific Ocean every two to seven years. It's been
*17:07.220- 17:12.100* :  going on for decades, probably centuries. And what that does is it sets off a chain reaction
*17:12.100- 17:16.060* :  around the world. It brings heat to the surface. It makes the whole world a bit warmer.
*17:16.060- 17:20.860* :  It changes the nature of the winds that blow around the world as well. So it changes the nature
*17:20.860- 17:26.260* :  of the weather that people get. So it makes storms in the Pacific more likely. It makes storms in
*17:26.260- 17:30.400* :  the Atlantic less likely. It sees the southern United States become wetter, the northern part become
*17:30.400- 17:36.720* :  drier. In Africa, though it has its possibly its most powerful impacts. So countries like Kenya
*17:36.820- 17:41.980* :  and Tanzania often see much wetter weather during an El Niño phase and countries in the southern
*17:41.980- 17:49.700* :  part of Africa. Everywhere from Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique, they all see much
*17:49.700- 17:53.860* :  drier weather. And that can have significant impacts on food production. That's what we've been
*17:53.860- 18:00.680* :  seeing this year. And El Niño runs for about nine months to a year. It peaked in December. But
*18:01.080- 18:05.500* :  the scientists say it's two or three months after that that you get the full effects of it and
*18:05.500- 18:10.180* :  it starts to fade. So in recent days, scientists have said El Niño has ended, but we're still
*18:10.180- 18:13.420* :  feeling those effects. And in the last couple of months, particularly in southern Africa,
*18:13.800- 18:17.280* :  the drought there has been clearly linked to this powerful El Niño.
*18:17.900- 18:22.520* :  One of the areas which has been badly affected by El Niño is the Philippines where the
*18:22.520- 18:27.560* :  beginning of the warm dry season has coincided with the tail end of the climate phenomenon.
*18:28.160- 18:34.200* :  Rina Galani is the UN climate crisis coordinator for the El Niño response. And she told
*18:34.200- 18:39.500* :  the Zina Gupta how the country had been affected. I'm here in the Philippines. And
*18:40.300- 18:47.920* :  you know, here they 50% of the Philippine land has been affected by drought and the crops have
*18:47.920- 18:55.500* :  failed. So we have about 1.4 million people affected right now by the drought. And it's sort of
*18:55.820- 19:02.000* :  the El Niño peak is ending, but the impact is going to last a lot longer. I mean, people haven't
*19:02.000- 19:06.640* :  been able to grow food. So there isn't food on the table and there isn't anything to sell to
*19:06.640- 19:11.580* :  earn money. And this will be felt throughout the year. And how does this feed into the global
*19:11.580- 19:17.860* :  food supply cycle? There's a problem actually in many parts of the world. So because of the
*19:17.860- 19:24.120* :  impact of El Niño actually in the drought. So in southern Africa, there's also been harshly
*19:24.120- 19:29.640* :  hit. You're actually seeing governments that used to provide food to other parts of the world,
*19:30.360- 19:34.740* :  including in that region now having to say we don't have enough for ourselves. We're going to
*19:34.740- 19:39.960* :  have to hold it back and not only that fine food from elsewhere. We're seeing prices of rice
*19:39.960- 19:47.620* :  actually go up. I think there's an increase of about 39% because of this issue in Asia as well.
*19:47.920- 19:54.060* :  Then how much difficult does it become for an agency like the United Nations to ensure that
*19:54.060- 19:59.160* :  food, for example, is provided to the poorest of the poor if you're looking at the prices go up.
*19:59.680- 20:06.260* :  And the impact of it on especially the regions which are undergoing drought and severe food crisis.
*20:06.620- 20:13.380* :  Many of the governments, I mean the good news is that we now have much more better way of
*20:13.380- 20:19.700* :  predicting that this is coming. So many governments have actually prepared ahead of time and kept
*20:19.700- 20:25.420* :  reserves of food. But there are the most vulnerable that we need to support and help feed. So we
*20:25.960- 20:30.980* :  do source food from elsewhere, but the costs are going up. And as you know, we've had this problem
*20:30.980- 20:38.960* :  on the cost of fuel even as well, which impacts our ability to move it around. And of course, many,
*20:38.960- 20:44.360* :  many communities are talking about the fact that they are now eating less than the three meals
*20:44.360- 20:51.120* :  a day that they used to. Rina Galani. And now to El Salvador, where a woman has been reunited
*20:51.120- 20:56.800* :  with her relatives, almost 40 years after being sent to the US for adoption during her country's
*20:56.800- 21:02.280* :  civil war. Floor Wallmann only learnt last year that she had living relatives back in Central
*21:02.280- 21:06.840* :  America and that they'd been searching for her. Although the war between left wing guerrillas
*21:06.840- 21:13.260* :  and a US-backed army ended in 1992, efforts continue to reunite hundreds of families separated
*21:13.260- 21:15.720* :  during the fighting, as Mike Lanchin now reports.
*21:20.740- 21:26.720* :  Joy and happiness in a remote village in Northern El Salvador. As Floor Wallmann meets three siblings
*21:26.720- 21:34.100* :  she never knew existed. Tears and hugs from the 42-year-old Floor and her two half-brothers and
*21:34.100- 21:41.340* :  a half-sister, as neighbours and well-wishers look on. We looked for you for years, oldest brother
*21:41.340- 21:49.520* :  Marlon tells Floor, but then we found out that you were looking for us. Floor has spent almost all
*21:49.520- 21:55.720* :  her life in the US after being adopted from El Salvador by an American couple. That was in 1984
*21:55.720- 22:01.740* :  at the height of the civil war between left-wing rebels and the US-backed army. Floor was five
*22:01.740- 22:06.980* :  at the time. She still remembers the terror of fleeing government soldiers near her home.
*22:07.200- 22:13.120* :  I would just remember they were saying run, they're here and I kept on running and I ended up
*22:13.480- 22:18.240* :  seeing a little shack. I didn't know what else to do so I kind of just ran in there and eventually
*22:19.360- 22:27.360* :  the door opened and there was a soldier there with a big rifle and he didn't say anything, he just
*22:27.360- 22:33.720* :  shot me. Luckily little Floor survived. The next thing she recalls is waking up in a strange house
*22:33.720- 22:39.060* :  in the capital, the home of her new foster parents. No one explained why she was there.
*22:42.900- 22:47.800* :  This is Margarita Samora, lead investigator for a Salvadorian organisation called
*22:47.800- 22:54.300* :  Associación Probusqueda. Since the war ended in 1992, the group has been trying to trace children
*22:54.300- 23:01.140* :  who are separated from their families during the conflict. So far, 400 have been located, many of
*23:01.140- 23:08.400* :  them abroad. Many of the children who were taken from the battlefield were given away in adoption.
*23:09.220- 23:14.340* :  Many appeared as if their parents had given their consent, but the parents were in fact killed.
*23:14.340- 23:20.800* :  There was no consent given. Margarita says that there are many more children who must now be adults
*23:20.800- 23:32.140* :  still unaccounted for. Sunday massed in a tall white brick church that dominates the simple
*23:32.140- 23:37.920* :  square of this village. Many of the missing children were from areas like these where the rebels
*23:37.920- 23:43.700* :  had hideouts in the surrounding hills. Even now, more than 30 years after the war ended,
*23:43.700- 23:50.200* :  families still hold out hope. Father Manuel Acosta is a priest from the area and until recently
*23:50.200- 23:57.060* :  was part of a government commission looking into such cases. The continuous separation of
*23:57.060- 24:02.560* :  families becomes a fracture in society. I think that if people don't have their own peace
*24:03.040- 24:08.900* :  and peace for their families, then society has a whole cannot achieve peace and conflict and
*24:08.900- 24:13.160* :  divisions just continue. Growing up with her adoptive American parents,
*24:13.160- 24:17.900* :  Floor always wondered whether anyone was searching for her back in El Salvador.
*24:18.800- 24:26.260* :  I just always wanted to know why. Why? I wasn't with my biological parents when I was running.
*24:26.260- 24:31.960* :  Why was I separated? Floor's search for information eventually led her to Margarita Samora
*24:32.280- 24:38.360* :  and the Probusca da Association in San Salvador. Last year they got back to her to say that although
*24:38.360- 24:42.880* :  her birth parents were no longer alive, they had located surviving relatives.
*24:44.120- 24:51.160* :  In life, it's just a total different feeling. So do you still think of yourself as one of El Salvador's
*24:51.160- 24:55.720* :  missing children? Yes, but not anymore. I'm not missing anymore.
*24:56.420- 25:01.620* :  As Floor Wormen, ending that report from Mike Lanchin and you can hear more about the story of
*25:01.620- 25:08.560* :  El Salvador's missing children on the documentary to search online for BBC World Service,
*25:08.580- 25:15.320* :  the documentary. To China next, where the authorities are dealing with an athletics scandal,
*25:15.920- 25:20.880* :  the first four runners in this year's Beijing Men's Half Marathon have been stripped of their
*25:20.880- 25:26.220* :  results and their prize money. It comes after footage showed three of the runners appear to let
*25:26.220- 25:32.160* :  a Chinese athlete cross the finishing line first. I spoke to our China correspondent Stephen
*25:33.200- 25:37.840* :  McDonald. These three African runners coming towards the finish line. I suppose a couple of
*25:37.840- 25:43.160* :  hundred meters out just behind them. The Chinese champion Hurgen. Now one of the Africans can be
*25:43.160- 25:48.640* :  seen indicating to Hurgen to go past them. He does this. It's all very clear. This is what's going
*25:48.640- 25:56.780* :  on and he crosses the line first. This led to an outcry on social media here from Chinese sports
*25:56.780- 26:01.540* :  fans. Now on the one hand, you might think they'd be happy to see a Chinese runner win the Beijing
*26:01.540- 26:08.280* :  Half Marathon, but not in these circumstances. They felt that it was a sham and there was a lot
*26:08.280- 26:14.560* :  of complaints. As a result, an investigation from the organizers of the race and also China's
*26:14.560- 26:19.320* :  sporting if they come up with is the decision to strip the runners of their medals, to strip them
*26:19.320- 26:26.200* :  of their prize money and their final placings. One of the key problems also, I mean, apart from the
*26:26.200- 26:31.880* :  fact that they let Hurgen cross before them, is that the Africans from Kenya and Ethiopia
*26:32.620- 26:37.600* :  were actually paces in the race. So that's the people who are not real participants. They
*26:37.600- 26:43.540* :  joined the race to go out hard and drag everyone else along to make it a sort of faster result.
*26:43.580- 26:50.000* :  Well, they weren't properly identified as pace runners and so to the casual viewer, they might
*26:50.000- 26:57.120* :  think, well, there goes Hurgen is just charging past these African runners when they were not actually
*26:57.120- 27:03.100* :  fully fledged participants in the marathon anyway. So given that, it seems perhaps some people might
*27:03.100- 27:09.500* :  think it's a little bit unfair on them and indeed on Hurgen as well. What have the runners been
*27:09.500- 27:15.400* :  saying about their actions? Well, the decisions only just been announced. So we haven't heard from
*27:15.400- 27:20.540* :  them yet, but like initially, I mean, they weren't trying to hide it. Like for example, the
*27:20.540- 27:26.720* :  Kenyan runner will him hang out the day after the race. He was interviewed by the BBC and he said,
*27:26.720- 27:32.460* :  yeah, I let Hurgen win because he's my friend. So they're very open about the fact that they were
*27:32.460- 27:39.980* :  doing this and on one way, it sort of looked, I guess, like a kind of sportsmanship type thing,
*27:39.980- 27:45.180* :  you know, you're the local hero will let you win. But you know, people who organize these races,
*27:45.180- 27:50.920* :  they want them to be serious. It's it's not any old race. It's a Beijing half marathon. It's not
*27:50.920- 27:57.900* :  the main marathon here, but still it's an important race. And to have it finish in such a kind of,
*27:59.200- 28:06.320* :  seemingly dodgy fashion has not gone down well with China sports fans and nor has it gone down well
*28:06.320- 28:10.620* :  with the officials here who've been very critical of how the whole matter was handled.
*28:11.280- 28:17.760* :  Stephen McDonald. Doctors in Japan are not at all happy with Google maps. And more specifically,
*28:17.760- 28:23.880* :  the reviews left on Google maps about them. So they've taken action. Our age of Pacific
*28:23.880- 28:30.440* :  editor Celia Hatten told me more. 63 doctors in Japan have gathered together to launch what's
*28:30.440- 28:38.280* :  being described as a landmark lawsuit against Google maps. They say that's because they feel like
*28:38.280- 28:44.880* :  punching bags, they say, because when a patient goes on and leaves a negative review for a medical
*28:44.880- 28:51.540* :  clinic on Google maps, the doctors themselves have no way to answer back to these reviews because
*28:51.540- 28:58.260* :  of patient confidentiality. And the doctors go on to say that unlike a regular business that's
*28:58.260- 29:04.000* :  reviewed on Google maps, like a coffee shop or a manicure place, if a negative review is left,
*29:04.000- 29:08.620* :  it's because they didn't live up to customer service. The business didn't go far enough to
*29:08.620- 29:14.900* :  please a customer. But doctors say they're not like that. They're tasked with treating their
*29:14.900- 29:20.620* :  patient's health within certain guidelines. So they don't want to feel additional pressure to
*29:20.620- 29:27.840* :  refuse patients, possible requests from medication or extra tests, just to satisfy their reviews
*29:27.840- 29:32.720* :  that might turn up on Google maps. And so that's why they've gone to the platform to say you need
*29:32.720- 29:36.740* :  to do a better job of taking down these negative reviews. And briefly, there were because Google
*29:36.740- 29:41.320* :  maps is pretty influential. Yeah, that's right. So Google maps it's described by the lawyers as being
*29:41.320- 29:46.560* :  essential infrastructure in Japan. And that's true. Google maps is incredibly detailed in Japan,
*29:46.560- 29:52.340* :  almost every business has a lot of reviews. And that includes medical clinics much to the doctors
*29:52.340- 29:58.980* :  discussed. Celia Hatton, she is the world's biggest pop star. Some might even say she is the
*29:58.980- 30:04.700* :  music industry. Taylor Swift has surprised her fans by releasing what she described as a secret
*30:04.700- 30:08.700* :  double album version of her new record. Stephanie Zacherson reports.
*30:18.680- 30:25.000* :  When Taylor Swift releases new music, she does it with a bang. Her latest album called The
*30:25.000- 30:31.340* :  Tortured Poets Department had already made Spotify history by becoming the most pre-saved album
*30:31.340- 30:39.080* :  ever on the streaming servers. And as a lover of Easter eggs and surprises, overnight she revealed
*30:39.080- 30:46.240* :  it's a double album of 31 tracks, two hours and two minutes. That makes it the longest album yet
*30:46.280- 30:51.980* :  from the multi-grammy award winner whose global era's tour is having such an economic impact
*30:51.980- 30:57.620* :  that it's actually improving the GDP of the country's where she performs on stage.
*30:57.840- 31:03.080* :  Laura Snapes is the guardian's deputy music editor. There's basically a Taylor Swift industrial
*31:03.080- 31:06.500* :  complex at this point. There will be thousands of articles published today working out what the
*31:06.500- 31:10.960* :  songs are about. We're less than a month away of the tour coming to Europe when I see that she's
*31:10.960- 31:15.440* :  going to revamp the era's tour with a new bit dedicated to this album. So fans who have seen the
*31:15.480- 31:19.160* :  the concert film of the era's tour on Disney Prasser in the cinema will get something new.
*31:19.160- 31:23.060* :  You'll be further incentivised to go again and then I suspect that will be put out in the cinemas too.
*31:23.500- 31:25.840* :  So what are reviewers making of the new record?
*31:25.840- 31:32.260* :  Broading Stones labeled it Swift's most personal album yet. The Los Angeles Times writes that it
*31:32.260- 31:39.120* :  emanates a proudly villainous energy and Billboard called it a wildly unguarded breakup album.
*31:39.860- 31:45.700* :  The so-called Swifties, the pop stars fans, have been gathering for listening parties across the
*31:45.700- 31:51.660* :  world, staying up late or getting up early to have a first listen to the new tunes. Is it
*31:51.660- 31:57.680* :  Pearson and Isabel Butterworth are president and founders of the Taylor Swift Society at the
*31:57.680- 32:02.860* :  University of Sheffield in the UK. She's not really telling the full story so it's really easy
*32:02.860- 32:09.760* :  to relate it to your life and her songs have grown with her as she's gone on. As we see in this new
*32:09.760- 32:14.940* :  album we had love her because she was in love and now we have the tortured poets department because
*32:15.160- 32:20.680* :  that love didn't last and I think people can relate to it being in that situation.
*32:29.300- 32:34.080* :  Taylor Swift's new single Fortnite ending that report by Stephanie Zacherson.
*32:36.640- 32:40.220* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast
