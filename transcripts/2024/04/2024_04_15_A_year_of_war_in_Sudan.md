*00:56.620- 00:59.720* :  People fixing the world from the BBC World Service.
*01:05.120- 01:07.820* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:09.840- 01:14.780* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Monday, the 15th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:15.400- 01:20.700* :  A year after Sudan's civil war began, an international conference has opened in France to raise
*01:20.700- 01:24.160* :  humanitarian aid and find ways to end the conflict.
*01:24.840- 01:29.060* :  As world leaders urge restraint from Israel after the Iranian attacks of the weekend,
*01:29.520- 01:31.860* :  Tehran calls them an act of self-defense.
*01:34.820- 01:35.880* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:36.420- 01:41.440* :  When I was lying there on the ground bleeding profusely, I found myself idiotically thinking
*01:41.440- 01:43.560* :  that's my nice suits about to be ruined.
*01:44.360- 01:49.260* :  Two years on, we hear from the author Salman Rushdie on the attack that left him without
*01:49.260- 01:50.420* :  sight in one eye.
*01:50.840- 01:55.700* :  For that, and a new report tells us why adults with Covid suffer far more than children.
*01:59.480- 02:04.980* :  Since civil war broke out in Sudan exactly a year ago today, almost 9 million people
*02:05.020- 02:05.840* :  have been displaced.
*02:06.440- 02:11.160* :  The conflict between the government forces and a paramilitary group called the Rapid Support
*02:11.160- 02:16.180* :  Forces is as intense as ever and is creating what the UN says could become the world's
*02:16.320- 02:17.660* :  largest hunger crisis.
*02:18.380- 02:23.460* :  At an international conference in Paris aimed at boosting aid for Sudan, the French Foreign
*02:23.460- 02:29.220* :  Minister Stefan Sejorné said the Sudanese people had been victims of indifference and a wall
*02:29.220- 02:30.880* :  of silence around the conflict.
*02:31.680- 02:37.080* :  The task is huge.
*02:37.700- 02:39.760* :  Let me give you some figures for this crisis.
*02:40.560- 02:46.560* :  27 million Sudanese, which is more than half of the population, are in need of humanitarian
*02:46.820- 02:49.500* :  aid. Some 15 million of those are children.
*02:49.840- 02:55.520* :  18 million of them are in situations of acute food insecurity facing famine.
*02:56.420- 03:01.060* :  And over 8 million people have had to leave their homes and are therefore displaced.
*03:01.700- 03:07.900* :  The US special envoy for Sudan, Tom Pettyello, says the civil war has triggered waves of
*03:07.900- 03:10.600* :  killings and brought the country to the brink of famine.
*03:11.300- 03:14.620* :  The international community needs to step up with more humanitarian aid.
*03:14.740- 03:17.100* :  We appreciate that the French are gathering donors.
*03:17.740- 03:23.860* :  We've seen only 5% of the need met at a time where headed into the rainy season and the
*03:23.860- 03:24.420* :  lean season.
*03:24.860- 03:30.880* :  So one thing is we really just need the world to get that aid directly to the camps outside
*03:30.880- 03:33.440* :  and to address the humanitarian access issues.
*03:33.960- 03:38.240* :  But ultimately the real thing that the Sudanese people want and the only thing that will ultimately
*03:38.300- 03:41.100* :  address the humanitarian crisis is to end the war.
*03:41.940- 03:46.660* :  I asked our Africa correspondent Barbara Pledascha how much things had deteriorated for
*03:46.660- 03:48.340* :  people in Sudan over the past year.
*03:48.980- 03:53.080* :  The women and children of course are the most vulnerable populations and so there have
*03:53.080- 03:58.180* :  been a study for example in one refugee camp in northern Darfur to see how much they were
*03:58.180- 04:02.400* :  affected by malnutrition and the results were that a third of them were a third of children
*04:02.400- 04:07.580* :  under five and of pregnant women and new mothers, which is a staggering amount.
*04:08.100- 04:12.740* :  It's something that already Sudan had been fragile before the war but this has really
*04:12.740- 04:19.220* :  up the stakes of the need there and this is compounded by the complete collapse of so
*04:19.220- 04:23.980* :  many things, the collapse of state services, the economy has been ruined in many areas so
*04:23.980- 04:25.980* :  Sudan can produce its own food anymore.
*04:26.540- 04:30.500* :  Many of the people have just been displaced in our own camps like the one I mentioned but
*04:30.500- 04:32.200* :  they get almost no access to aid.
*04:32.200- 04:36.460* :  The Army is accused of blocking access across conflict lines, the rapid support forces are
*04:36.460- 04:37.700* :  accused of looting supplies.
*04:38.140- 04:41.020* :  And there's just not nearly enough of the aid either, 6 percent.
*04:41.020- 04:46.280* :  That is the amount that the UN's appeal has been met so far and that will be one of the
*04:46.500- 04:49.040* :  key focuses of the conference in Paris.
*04:49.500- 04:55.800* :  So these people in Paris, do they have the power to change the situation, get more aid
*04:55.800- 05:00.040* :  in what leverage do they have over these armed groups that aren't letting the aid in
*05:01.600- 05:01.620* :  anyway?
*05:01.620- 05:04.340* :  Well if you look at the past year and especially the past months they don't seem to have that
*05:04.340- 05:09.100* :  much leverage at all because they have been pressing for aid to be able to get in.
*05:09.380- 05:13.760* :  Now they can make a difference in terms of how much is available and how much money is
*05:13.760- 05:18.820* :  used but in terms of getting the access to it that depends on a large degree to the
*05:18.820- 05:23.400* :  Army which had been blocking into areas controlled by the rapid support forces because it wanted
*05:23.400- 05:27.920* :  to stop any weapons from getting through it said but that has also severely affected
*05:28.420- 05:28.940* :  access for aid.
*05:28.940- 05:34.520* :  So there will be pressure also put on the parties to respond and this conference has brought
*05:34.520- 05:38.820* :  together representatives from Sudan's neighbors, from Gulf Arab nations, from Western powers
*05:39.420- 05:44.180* :  as well as the UN and humanitarian actors and that they – it wants to send a strong
*05:44.180- 05:47.920* :  message to the war and parties to allow the aid and to end the conflict.
*05:48.060- 05:52.480* :  And I think also just to sort of send a message to wake up the world as you were mentioning
*05:52.480- 05:56.560* :  Sudan has not been getting that much attention and they want to move it to the top of the
*05:56.560- 05:56.980* :  agenda.
*05:59.600- 06:03.700* :  Iran has sought to justify its unprecedented attack on Israel.
*06:03.700- 06:09.220* :  An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said the strikes were a limited act of self-defense
*06:09.900- 06:13.140* :  and that Western countries should appreciate Iran's restraint.
*06:13.860- 06:17.440* :  Israel's allies have urged it to avoid any escalation.
*06:17.440- 06:23.240* :  Germany's foreign minister Anna Lena Baerbock called for calm she warned that Tehran had
*06:23.240- 06:25.760* :  led the Middle East to the edge of the abyss.
*06:26.240- 06:31.320* :  The British foreign secretary David Cameron told the BBC, Israel needed to think with
*06:31.320- 06:32.680* :  its head, not its heart.
*06:33.440- 06:37.460* :  I can understand how every Israeli this morning would think, you know, we must respond,
*06:37.460- 06:40.320* :  we have a right to respond and they do have a right to respond.
*06:40.820- 06:44.980* :  But I think the smart and tough thing to do is to actually, as Biden put it, you know,
*06:44.980- 06:51.140* :  take the wind, this has been a failure for Iran, now let's focus on Gaza and its focus
*06:51.140- 06:55.000* :  on Hamas because, of course, Israel have now offered Hamas a deal.
*06:55.980- 06:58.820* :  David Mensa is an Israeli government spokesperson.
*06:59.060- 07:02.920* :  He told the BBC that his country had the right to defend itself.
*07:03.720- 07:10.300* :  We are at the very essence, not a war-seeking nation, you know, on Saturday night, Israelis
*07:10.300- 07:16.720* :  spent a night, months, dads, kids, in and out of bond shelters in our country.
*07:17.280- 07:23.420* :  Israel must be able to defend itself, and it will, both defensively and offensively,
*07:23.420- 07:28.980* :  Israel, whose first objective is to protect its own citizens, we will be defended.
*07:29.880- 07:33.800* :  Our Middle East correspondent, you are now considers how Israel might proceed.
*07:34.620- 07:38.820* :  Israel hasn't come out with a formal response, despite its war cabinet meeting for quite a
*07:38.820- 07:40.580* :  long time yesterday.
*07:41.200- 07:46.200* :  It's said to favor hitting back at Iran, but it's divided about when and how it should
*07:46.240- 07:46.840* :  do so.
*07:47.200- 07:52.120* :  The Israeli military, we understand, has been drawing up a whole list of different possible
*07:52.120- 07:57.260* :  options, but when it comes to weighing a response, you know, you've got, on the far right,
*07:57.820- 08:02.420* :  some ministers like the National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gavir, saying Israel should
*08:02.640- 08:05.920* :  go berserk to restore Israeli deterrents in the region.
*08:05.980- 08:10.320* :  You've got the Finance Minister, Bezel El-Smotrich, saying he'll use his full influence to make
*08:10.320- 08:13.360* :  sure Israel retaliates for the Iranian attack.
*08:13.880- 08:16.680* :  And the argument really here is that Iran has crossed a red line.
*08:16.680- 08:22.080* :  If it's not dealt with in a specially sort of powerful way, it will do so again.
*08:22.660- 08:27.140* :  But then you have key voices in the war cabinet, I think important to look at the comments
*08:27.140- 08:31.900* :  have come out from them, from the Defence Minister, you have Galant, from the centrist,
*08:31.900- 08:37.720* :  many Gans, who are with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that the three key
*08:37.720- 08:42.540* :  decision makers in that war cabinet, they've been talking in a bit more of a balanced way
*08:42.540- 08:47.900* :  about the opportunity to strengthen the strategic alliance against the threat from Iran.
*08:47.900- 08:52.500* :  And you get the sense that they really see an opportunity here to reset international
*08:52.500- 08:57.440* :  relations after heavy criticism over Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza.
*08:57.500- 09:01.560* :  And I think through the day, they're going to be hearing more and more from Israel's international
*09:01.640- 09:04.060* :  allies about the need for restraint.
*09:04.060- 09:08.300* :  We've had Lord Cameron there talking about the need for a smart and tough response,
*09:08.300- 09:11.260* :  the British Prime Minister's expected to speak later.
*09:11.720- 09:15.360* :  But they're also expecting visits in the days ahead from the likes of Lord Cameron
*09:15.360- 09:18.240* :  and from other foreign officials as well, according to Israeli media.
*09:18.880- 09:19.680* :  You land now there.
*09:20.340- 09:25.160* :  And in a special episode of the Global News Podcast, we're going to be answering your questions
*09:25.160- 09:27.420* :  on the current Iran-Israel conflict.
*09:27.420- 09:34.600* :  You can get in touch and send yours by email us at globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*09:36.020- 09:41.180* :  To India now, where the largest democracy in the world is about to be gripped by election fever,
*09:41.180- 09:46.240* :  voting starts on Friday and almost a billion people are registered to head to the polls.
*09:46.240- 09:51.340* :  The Prime Minister Narendra Modi is bidding for a third consecutive term in office.
*09:51.580- 09:54.440* :  But what will he need to do to win over young voters?
*09:54.440- 10:00.900* :  The BBC's James Kumerisami is in the south of the country in Bengaluru to meet four students
*10:01.360- 10:02.680* :  who will be voting for the first time.
*10:04.000- 10:09.800* :  So I'm at St Joseph's University in the centre of Bengaluru and we're in the shade of a rather
*10:09.800- 10:16.000* :  remarkable tree, a banyan tree. I think it's 90 years old, I'm told, the roots hanging down
*10:16.000- 10:22.500* :  and in fact the buildings around here were constructed in order to keep the tree exactly where it is.
*10:22.520- 10:27.500* :  It's a magnificent structure and I'm joined by some people a bit younger than the banyan tree.
*10:27.980- 10:31.280* :  Some of the first time voters here, perhaps you'll introduce yourselves.
*10:32.160- 10:36.840* :  I'm Shriya's, I'm a first-year student and I'm just 18 so this would be the first time I'll be voting.
*10:37.340- 10:40.580* :  I'm Devushidata, 182. Going to vote for the first time, very excited.
*10:41.140- 10:44.280* :  Hi, I'm Sanat, I'm 18 and I'm a first-time voter.
*10:44.580- 10:47.440* :  I'm Devika, I'm a proud first-time voter studying in Sanjus.
*10:48.000- 10:51.540* :  So the ladies told me they're excited and proud so I'm going to start with the ladies.
*10:51.540- 10:54.140* :  I would have done anyway but so why are you excited?
*10:54.520- 10:59.240* :  I think this is the first time that we will be involved as responsible citizens of the country
*10:59.420- 11:05.800* :  in a process as big as giving your voice in the democracy and I think that is a right of course
*11:05.920- 11:11.140* :  but it also gives a little bit of a responsibility on our shoulders to sort of choose who is going
*11:11.140- 11:13.640* :  to run the government. So how are you making that choice?
*11:13.940- 11:20.280* :  Indian family, dinner table conversations about politics is very to do thing but as a responsible
*11:20.280- 11:25.280* :  first-time voter I think it's more of getting involved in the process to understand how it happens
*11:25.840- 11:30.800* :  looking into who is helping out more who is actually putting in 100% efforts into the whole
*11:30.800- 11:33.280* :  process would be someone that I would want to vote for.
*11:33.580- 11:36.120* :  Pride was the word you used. Tell us about that.
*11:36.260- 11:41.260* :  I'm a X-milk tree person's daughter so being proud to be a citizen of our country means
*11:41.260- 11:46.660* :  you are a person who are living in the country so voting is our right it's our privilege to vote
*11:46.660- 11:53.220* :  for the people who represent us as a whole so it's my pride to vote for a country to represent
*11:53.780- 11:57.400* :  well let's get on to the issues that are important to you what are you looking at what are the
*11:57.400- 12:01.620* :  issues that are important to you in this election? I am really focusing at a government which will
*12:01.620- 12:05.940* :  provide employment for me or the stage where I can showcase my skills which I am good at
*12:06.160- 12:09.580* :  because that's quite an issue at the moment for young people in India isn't it finding jobs.
*12:09.580- 12:14.600* :  Jobs yes so India basically is a very skillful nation with all the use but the problem we are
*12:14.600- 12:19.700* :  facing is we are not getting the exact stage for the skilled people skilled labor so that I can
*12:19.700- 12:25.600* :  contribute to my nation as well and also be a responsible citizen skills so is that important for
*12:25.600- 12:30.980* :  you? That definitely is important now being the largest democracy in the world and definitely
*12:30.980- 12:36.800* :  it's not possible to cater to literally everyone's needs but what a government should look forward
*12:36.800- 12:41.200* :  to after it comes to power should be to definitely cater the needs of most of the people if not
*12:41.200- 12:45.800* :  all so that the true potential of our country can be tapped and can I ask what you think of
*12:45.820- 12:52.100* :  India and where it's going I mean you talked you've talked about the issue with skills and jobs
*12:52.160- 12:55.720* :  do you want to stay in India is this do you see your future here do you want to travel
*12:56.240- 13:00.280* :  India is a very great country sir and I would really like to be here but I would not wish to go to
*13:00.280- 13:05.360* :  other countries the coming government what we are expecting is to provide a stage for us if that
*13:05.360- 13:09.660* :  happens no youth is going to escape from India and India is going to be a top of the country sir
*13:09.860- 13:14.660* :  you're nodding yeah I'm just nodding because I support what exactly he said I'm an
*13:14.660- 13:19.140* :  intracilations public policy student so I'll probably move to other country but just to work for
*13:19.140- 13:25.040* :  India so that's a pride in me and as a country in India is that report was by James Kramasami
*13:26.240- 13:31.420* :  now it is hard to imagine the pain of those last few strides at the end of a professional long
*13:31.420- 13:36.440* :  distance race pushing the limits of your body to beat the competition to the finishing line
*13:37.120- 13:43.020* :  but what about letting someone win well in China organizers of the Beijing half marathon
*13:43.580- 13:48.840* :  are investigating allegations that three East African athletes deliberately let China's
*13:48.840- 13:55.700* :  star runner her chair crossed the line before them and win the race carry Alan monitors Chinese
*13:55.700- 14:02.280* :  media for us in state media you would expect normally for a Chinese star of an event like this that
*14:02.280- 14:08.200* :  tens of thousands of people took part in to be celebrated but there is skepticism being shown in
*14:08.200- 14:15.240* :  newspapers today about video footage that's been shown of what looks like three of these athletes
*14:15.240- 14:20.140* :  who are winning in the final stages and they appear to be looking back and waving their hands
*14:20.680- 14:27.220* :  and so you've got opinions in newspapers today saying that suspicions are valid and and calls for
*14:27.220- 14:34.220* :  an investigation into this because it could be match fixing yeah it does to the untrained eye look
*14:34.220- 14:38.860* :  relatively suspicious because they've seen to be sort of almost showing him the way to go on the
*14:38.880- 14:45.420* :  track and then sort of ushering him forwards obviously nothing has been proven to date but I
*14:45.420- 14:51.060* :  imagine a Chinese people in China take sport very seriously don't they so they wouldn't want to see
*14:51.060- 14:57.100* :  one of their athletes winning by nefarious means absolutely and this has really been a talking
*14:57.100- 15:02.140* :  point in the last few weeks because there has been a large scale investigation into corruption and
*15:02.140- 15:09.180* :  match fixing in football so there has been talk about how things like this in regards to football
*15:09.180- 15:14.660* :  whether they could actually damage the reputation of Chinese people in sport and so people watching
*15:14.660- 15:19.020* :  this video footage today even though they might want to celebrate a Chinese athlete winning this
*15:19.020- 15:23.780* :  event that they are concerned and they're saying that they want an investigation to be carried out
*15:23.780- 15:28.480* :  this is the talking point on scene a waibo which is China's equivalent of a platform like eggs
*15:28.760- 15:33.720* :  people saying that there has to be an investigation into this and and both the marathon partner
*15:33.720- 15:38.340* :  ex-step and the Beijing sports bureau have said that they've received feedback in response to this
*15:38.740- 15:44.060* :  and they are looking into it and and they they will be making a statement in due course very
*15:44.060- 15:49.560* :  interesting is it something you've seen in in the past suspicious things like this I have I can't
*15:49.560- 15:54.020* :  say I've seen a video like this though before it's so it does look quite suspicious but it's
*15:54.020- 15:58.940* :  very difficult to tell I mean it's been taken out of context and and yes it's it's largely one
*15:58.940- 16:03.140* :  national newspaper that's reporting on this but you know it's difficult to know when you're running
*16:03.140- 16:08.680* :  you know people make hand gestures and stuff so it's very much up to the the experts to decide
*16:08.680- 16:18.300* :  whether this goes further Kerry Allen still to come one star that star has an audience in Sydney
*16:18.300- 16:23.420* :  London New York LA you can take them all over the world on tour and audiences will flock out you
*16:23.420- 16:27.540* :  don't need much else the new trend that's drawing crowds to the theatre
*16:36.040- 16:40.720* :  hey I'm Ryan Reynolds at Mint Mobile we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does
*16:40.980- 16:45.900* :  they charge you a lot we charge you a little so naturally when they announce they'd be raising
*16:45.900- 16:51.600* :  their prices due to inflation we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you that's
*16:51.600- 16:55.640* :  right we're cutting the price of mint unlimited from thirty dollars a month to just fifteen
*16:55.640- 17:00.520* :  dollars a month give it a try at mint mobile dot com slash switch forty five dollars upfront for

*17:07.680- 17:12.800* :  podcast looking for solutions to the problems we face today it could potentially ease the
*17:12.800- 17:18.880* :  suffering of millions we meet people with smart ideas to discover how they might change the world
*17:18.880- 17:24.280* :  for the better and this is a fairly cheap and easy way to get lots more solar capacity into the
*17:24.280- 17:30.420* :  middle of cities people fixing the world from the BBC World Service we have a solution let's do it
*17:30.580- 17:33.400* :  listen now wherever you get your BBC podcasts
*17:40.520- 17:47.000* :  now during the covid pandemic it was well documented that age was a key factor in how seriously
*17:47.000- 17:55.200* :  ill infected people became older adults were worst hit whilst children were rarely very ill at all
*17:55.700- 18:00.640* :  well a new study has revealed why that might be the case Philippa Roxby is our health reporter
*18:01.420- 18:06.340* :  the nose I am told is a virus production factory and it's the first place where the
*18:06.340- 18:11.540* :  covid virus ends up when it goes into the into the body and scientists wanted to analyse in
*18:11.540- 18:16.640* :  detail exactly what happens in real life when that virus gets into the nose so they looked at
*18:16.640- 18:21.820* :  nasal cells these are cells in the lining of the nose nasal epithelial cells and they looked at
*18:21.820- 18:26.660* :  them in picture dishes in the lab they got volunteers to donate their their cells and then they
*18:26.660- 18:31.180* :  looked at them over the first few days they grew them again so it takes time analyse them and then
*18:31.180- 18:37.360* :  watched what happened when they added coronavirus and they discovered that actually the picture of
*18:37.360- 18:41.580* :  the nose cells in young people was very different to the ones in older people and they reckon the
*18:41.580- 18:46.500* :  younger cells nose cells were much more protective the older ones didn't work quite so well
*18:46.680- 18:52.020* :  and they're just more vibrant more able to cope with the virus yet they think that in adults they
*18:52.020- 18:56.920* :  saw that there's a hundred times more virus in the adult nose so very quickly the children's
*18:56.920- 19:01.740* :  noses were able to fight off the virus somehow they need to find out exactly how but it was the
*19:01.740- 19:07.400* :  balance of cells in their nose whereas older noses aging noses weren't quite so good at that
*19:07.440- 19:11.960* :  the repair mechanism that they had wasn't so good and so they just ended up with more virus in
*19:11.980- 19:16.740* :  the nose so you've got an old nose it can't have a nose replacement your cells are just old
*19:16.960- 19:22.220* :  yeah why is this information useful though well scientists say that might actually help when it
*19:22.220- 19:26.060* :  comes to looking at treatments and therapies we shouldn't assume that therapy is going to be the same
*19:26.060- 19:30.740* :  no matter what age you are for COVID and so they might need to think about different therapies for
*19:30.740- 19:35.480* :  older people and different ones for younger people and they also want to look at other viruses so
*19:35.480- 19:39.760* :  you know what happens when flu gets into the nose does the same thing happens or or lots of other
*19:39.760- 19:44.120* :  infections so there's a lot more work to do but it's it's it's super interesting finding
*19:44.920- 19:51.360* :  Philippa Roxby for years the author Salman Rushdie lived under the threat of violence
*19:52.020- 19:58.540* :  in 1988 the Iranian leader Atala Hamani issued a fatwa against him for his controversial novel
*19:58.540- 20:04.980* :  the satanic verses then two years ago the threat turned to reality when a man attacked Mr.
*20:04.980- 20:06.800* :  Rushdie on stage in New York
*20:10.180- 20:18.720* :  author Salman Rushdie was attacked there was confusion and panic the attack happened in full
*20:18.720- 20:25.800* :  view of the audience with Sir Salman left injured lying on stage and eyewitnesses in deep shock
*20:26.480- 20:33.600* :  when he was stabbed 12 times and he lost his sight in one eye the suspect Hadimata was arrested
*20:33.600- 20:39.800* :  immediately and pleaded not guilty to attempted murder his trial was postponed because of Rushdie's
*20:40.000- 20:46.160* :  upcoming memoir about the attack the award-winning author spoke to Alan Yentob ahead of the book's
*20:46.160- 20:51.680* :  publication I did wonder if somebody was going to jump out of an audience one day he was dressed in
*20:51.680- 20:57.720* :  dark clothing and he had a black COVID mask and he just came sprinting up the stairs to the stage
*20:58.120- 21:03.080* :  and when I saw him running I stood up I don't know why I didn't fight and I don't know why I didn't
*21:03.080- 21:08.020* :  try to escape but I thought he just punched me very hard I didn't realize there was a knife who
*21:08.020- 21:15.660* :  has had and then I saw the blood coming out Rushdie was airlifted to hospital with his life in
*21:15.660- 21:23.320* :  the balance his wife Eliza never left his bedside the ring was very eerie and quiet Salman was just
*21:24.100- 21:30.540* :  lying there and I just remember the sounds of the machines and the ventilator breathing for him
*21:31.540- 21:37.120* :  it was devastating when I look at my husband each morning and what's missing
*21:38.480- 21:46.300* :  I think of this person who almost took my husband from me the first wound was here on the corner
*21:46.300- 21:52.060* :  of the jaw as I thought and then I think you just slashing wildly at everything across my neck my
*21:52.060- 21:59.000* :  forehead down the middle of my torso is one two three like that two on the side over here and one
*21:59.000- 22:06.880* :  on my thigh over here at some point I put up my hand to protect myself and he stuck a knife in it
*22:07.340- 22:12.940* :  and then there's the wound in my eye which was quite deep which is why there's no possibility of
*22:12.940- 22:18.940* :  saving the site language is a way of cutting things open and revealing the truth and so calling
*22:18.940- 22:25.060* :  this book knife is not just a description of the attack against me the book is the knife and it's
*22:25.060- 22:34.380* :  my way of fighting back it had been 33 and a half years since the Aatala Ruhala Khomeini's
*22:34.380- 22:39.680* :  notorious death order against me and all those involved in the publication of the satanic verses
*22:45.020- 22:51.660* :  surely the world had moved on and that subject was closed yet here approaching fast
*22:52.880- 23:00.000* :  was the sort of time traveler a murderous ghost from the past the man accused of carrying out the
*23:00.000- 23:07.400* :  attack is Hadimata from New Jersey he pleaded not guilty to attempted murder but his reporter to have
*23:07.400- 23:12.780* :  said he was surprised to hear that Rushdie survived the attack there will be a moment when I will be
*23:12.780- 23:18.880* :  in court with my attacker I don't know what he would save he was asked why did you do it if I
*23:18.880- 23:25.860* :  was to write a story in which somebody decided to murder a total stranger on the basis of having
*23:25.860- 23:31.580* :  read maybe two pages of what he'd written and seen a couple of YouTube videos publishes would say
*23:31.580- 23:37.300* :  that's not convincing so it is the most puzzling thing not only how little he knew about me but
*23:37.360- 23:42.280* :  that he didn't seem to feel the need to inform himself and he just decided that I was disingenuous
*23:42.280- 23:48.300* :  which is it seems to be not sufficient reason to commit murder and he had a bag of knives what
*23:48.300- 23:53.160* :  is that even about was he planning to hand them out ask people to join in it seems to make no
*23:53.160- 23:58.140* :  sense at all does this attack suggest that freedom of speech has got more and more difficult rather
*23:58.140- 24:03.340* :  less so freedom of speech has got much more difficult and not just for this kind of reason a lot
*24:03.340- 24:07.880* :  of people including a lot of young people I'm sorry to say I have formed the opinion that restrictions
*24:07.880- 24:14.540* :  on freedom of speech are often a good idea it's now almost okay to be prepared to suppress speech
*24:14.540- 24:18.780* :  that you don't agree with whereas of course the whole point of freedom of speech is that you have
*24:18.780- 24:24.680* :  to permit speech you don't agree with you've been through all of this what about the future I think
*24:24.680- 24:30.680* :  I'm a pretty obstinate person and I'm going to have my life when I was lying there on the ground
*24:30.680- 24:36.060* :  bleeding profusely I found myself idiotically thinking though that's my nice suits about to be
*24:36.060- 24:44.140* :  rude and my house keys are in that pocket which at the time of course is ludicrous but there's
*24:44.140- 24:49.160* :  an immensely strong survival instinct that human beings have that kicks in that was saying to me
*24:49.880- 24:54.140* :  you're going to live live live and I think that's why I wanted my house keys
*24:54.980- 25:01.020* :  Sam and Rushdie speak into Alan Yem Top when you think of nations where abortion is against the
*25:01.040- 25:06.400* :  law the mainly secular socially liberal Germany probably wouldn't immediately come to mind
*25:07.060- 25:12.200* :  but you would be wrong abortion is largely illegal there now though a government appointed
*25:12.200- 25:17.980* :  commission has recommended decriminalizing it Damon McGinnis is our correspondent in Berlin
*25:18.740- 25:22.760* :  I think a lot of people outside of Germany and even within Germany could be surprised by the fact
*25:22.780- 25:29.000* :  that abortions are illegal in principle but there's an exemption for the first 12 weeks of
*25:29.000- 25:32.900* :  a pregnancy women are allowed to terminate a pregnancy within the first 12 weeks but only
*25:33.540- 25:40.140* :  with a consultation an official consultation with a doctor up to three weeks before the procedure
*25:41.120- 25:47.380* :  what this means people who want to liberalize the law say is that even though women can carry out
*25:47.380- 25:53.740* :  an abortion or can have this procedure what happens in reality is there are plenty of barriers
*25:53.740- 25:58.200* :  so for example the fact that you have to find this consultation the fact that many doctors
*25:58.800- 26:03.780* :  and clinics are wary of advertising the fact they carry out an abortion means that it can be
*26:03.780- 26:09.320* :  hard to find information some people say and also that abortions have to be paid privately and not
*26:09.320- 26:16.140* :  part of the state regulated free care that people pay for ordinarily and there can also be a shortage
*26:16.140- 26:21.240* :  of clinics offering these procedures in certain areas certainly outside of big cities so all of
*26:21.240- 26:26.140* :  these all of this means that the current situation even though it's possible it does really put
*26:26.180- 26:32.120* :  barriers and stress to what can be an already difficult situation for many women so that's why
*26:32.120- 26:37.520* :  there has been pressure for a long time to liberalise or to clear up this quite murky situation
*26:37.660- 26:42.500* :  and that's what the report today is recommending to legalise abortions within the first 12 weeks
*26:42.740- 26:46.960* :  and yet there is opposition to that even legalising isn't it? That's right and I think particularly
*26:46.960- 26:51.600* :  from church leaders some church leaders have been very vocal in the past few weeks it's become
*26:51.600- 26:57.580* :  again a big debate here and the Conservatives of Opposition is also fiercely against changing
*26:57.580- 27:04.220* :  the law some of them say well it would open the flood gates to more abortions and I think what
*27:04.220- 27:08.820* :  we're seeing is also a concern that this can turn into a politicised issue so some Conservative
*27:08.820- 27:15.760* :  Opposition MPs are saying well the left wing led government here is trying to turn this into a
*27:15.760- 27:20.620* :  culture war ahead of the federal elections next year that's something the government would deny
*27:21.180- 27:25.620* :  but there's certainly what we're seeing is an increased ferocity around the debate we've had
*27:25.660- 27:30.500* :  protest the last few days in certain parts of Germany over this issue and I think we've given
*27:30.500- 27:35.140* :  we've got the fact that there are key elections coming up this year and next year we could see
*27:35.140- 27:43.140* :  a more politicised debate around this issue. Damian McGuinness. Now with the barbenheimer phenomenon
*27:43.140- 27:48.800* :  and other blockbusters it's been a big year for film and cinema but what about the world of theatre?
*27:49.200- 27:55.620* :  Well at the Olivier theatre awards in London on Sunday night Sarah Snoke snatched the award
*27:55.620- 28:01.020* :  for best actress for her one woman role in Dorian Gray and it's just one of a number of
*28:01.020- 28:07.400* :  single person plays that are now proving to be a big hit. So what's been behind this new trend?
*28:07.540- 28:13.380* :  The BBC's Michelle Hussein has been speaking to theatre critics Fiona Mountford and Kate Maltby.
*28:14.100- 28:19.480* :  This particular trend for solo shows I think the most important thing to say is that this is
*28:19.480- 28:24.840* :  about economics theatre is still struggling to recover from the Covid crisis I don't think one
*28:24.840- 28:30.400* :  can possibly overstate what an existential threat that was and solo shows are very portable they're
*28:30.400- 28:35.200* :  like I like to compare them to you know the Taylor Swift eras tour they've got one star that
*28:35.200- 28:40.440* :  star has an audience in Sydney London New York LA you can take them all over the world on tour
*28:40.440- 28:44.960* :  and audiences will flock out you don't need much else Fiona what do you think of this trend this
*28:44.960- 28:50.040* :  phenomenon? It's become particularly vibrant in theatre it's another way of theatre asserting
*28:50.040- 28:55.800* :  its primacy of the live experience we watch these actors maybe on our streaming at home and then
*28:55.800- 29:02.020* :  we can go to the theatre and actually share the same air see them live on stage sit unfold in real
*29:02.020- 29:07.440* :  time and that's one of the glories of theatre and I celebrate anything that draws fresh attention
*29:07.780- 29:14.020* :  but if more productions go down this route you have these very famous people in prominent roles and
*29:14.020- 29:18.780* :  you don't have the opportunities in an ensemble cast which also develop people well that's true
*29:18.800- 29:23.040* :  but I think we're not going I don't think we can say that one person shows are going to wipe out
*29:23.040- 29:28.200* :  the straight plays and musicals it's just another facet and obviously let us not forget you've got
*29:28.200- 29:33.720* :  to have an actor or an actress of a certain status to be able to support these shows so you couldn't
*29:33.720- 29:38.480* :  just put any sort of one person in and expect to sell tickets in the West End so it's got to be a
*29:38.480- 29:44.580* :  certain level of real star to be able to put these shows on so I think it's a bit of a self-selecting
*29:44.580- 29:50.840* :  number of plays that could manage this Fiona Mountford and Kate Maldby speaking to the BBC's Michele Hussain
*29:53.720- 29:57.900* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later on
*29:57.960- 30:02.500* :  if you want a comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it you can send us an email
