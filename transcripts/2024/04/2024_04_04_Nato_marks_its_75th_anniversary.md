*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news 7 days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:20.260* :  by advertising. People fixing the world is the podcast looking for solutions to the problems
*00:20.260- 00:25.240* :  we face today. It could potentially ease the suffering of millions. We have a solution.
*00:25.240- 00:29.560* :  Let's do it. People fixing the world from the BBC World Service.
*00:35.300- 00:39.280* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:41.980- 00:48.440* :  I'm Nigel Adely and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday 4 April, these are our main stories.
*00:49.240- 00:54.740* :  As NATO celebrates its 75th anniversary, Ukraine pleads for more missiles.
*00:55.440- 01:00.300* :  I don't want to spoil the birthday party, but my main message today will be patriots,
*01:00.300- 01:05.540* :  because saving Ukraine in life depends on the availability of patriots.
*01:05.820- 01:10.500* :  Myanmar rebel groups carry out drone attacks on key military targets in the capital.
*01:11.200- 01:16.000* :  Eight agencies have told Israel it must better respect the rules governing the protection
*01:16.420- 01:17.800* :  of humanitarian workers.
*01:21.780- 01:26.400* :  Also in this podcast, the former speaker of the South African Parliament appears in court
*01:26.400- 01:33.380* :  on corruption charges, and he won a million dollars at 15, but a gaming champion talks about why
*01:33.380- 01:38.860* :  he quits. I've realised that there is more to lasting gaming and you do grow up and it's not
*01:38.860- 01:41.760* :  a thing that you can do for ever, especially at a high level.
*01:46.040- 01:51.140* :  NATO is marking its 75th anniversary today, but it's no time to celebrate,
*01:51.140- 01:54.860* :  as leaders of the Defence Alliance worry they're not spending enough,
*01:55.420- 01:59.820* :  and not doing enough to prepare for the possibility of a wider war with Russia.
*02:00.560- 02:07.180* :  NATO's two newest members, Finland and Sweden, joined in direct response to Russia's invasion of
*02:07.180- 02:14.480* :  Ukraine in 2022. At a seven million Brussels, the NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg
*02:15.060- 02:20.380* :  said the alliance's success came from the interdependence of its North American and European
*02:20.380- 02:29.880* :  members. Europe needs America for its security. At the same time, North America also needs Europe.
*02:30.960- 02:36.500* :  European allies provide world-class militaries, vast intelligence networks,
*02:37.300- 02:45.400* :  and unique diplomatic leverage, multiplying America's might. I don't believe in America alone,
*02:46.520- 02:53.720* :  just as I don't believe in Europe alone. I believe in America and Europe together in NATO,
*02:54.800- 03:01.700* :  because we are stronger and safer together. The NATO Ukraine Council has been meeting,
*03:01.740- 03:07.660* :  and it was joined by the Ukrainian Foreign Minister to meet TRO Kulabar. What does he want from
*03:07.660- 03:11.960* :  today? I don't want to spoil the party, but of course my message is the birthday party,
*03:11.960- 03:19.160* :  but my main message today will be patriots, because saving Ukrainian life, saving Ukrainian
*03:19.160- 03:24.520* :  economy, saving Ukrainian cities depends on the availability of patriots and other
*03:24.520- 03:28.120* :  air defense systems in Ukraine, and we're talking about patriots because it's the only system
*03:28.120- 03:33.900* :  that can intercept ballistic missiles, and only in March, Ukraine was hit with 94 ballistic missiles.
*03:34.420- 03:39.760* :  But providing patriots depends on allies. They have plenty of them, so this will be my main focus
*03:39.760- 03:45.080* :  today. And what about the new member Finland? Here's the foreign minister, Alina Valtanen.
*03:45.460- 03:52.520* :  We very much agree with our colleague Kulabar that the need for aid is imminent. It is needed
*03:52.520- 03:57.820* :  in the short-term, in the medium-term, and also we need long-term commitments. We feel very
*03:57.820- 04:04.980* :  strongly that Ukraine is really fighting, obviously, not only for their freedom, but for that of all of us.
*04:05.320- 04:10.800* :  Mr. Stoltenberg has stressed that the alliance's commitment to helping Ukraine is not in question.
*04:10.800- 04:14.360* :  Our defense correspondent Jonathan Biel is in Brussels.
*04:14.940- 04:19.500* :  They've had the celebrations earlier today. They had a cake. They had a native him. They gave
*04:19.500- 04:26.480* :  speeches where you heard Jens Stoltenberg talking about the importance of America needing to be a
*04:26.480- 04:31.420* :  partner with Europe and Europe, needing to work with America. In other words, America should not
*04:31.420- 04:36.960* :  go it alone. That's clearly a reference affair. I think that's in Europe about what might happen if
*04:36.960- 04:41.840* :  Donald Trump is elected a second term. But I think there are two things. First of all, the focus
*04:41.840- 04:48.800* :  on Ukraine immediately, and that is that even Jens Stoltenberg has admitted that Ukraine hasn't
*04:48.800- 04:55.180* :  run out of courage, but it is running out of ammunition. So what they can do now, but also the
*04:55.180- 05:00.760* :  longer term and what some people are calling a Trump-proof plan. So if he did become president
*05:00.760- 05:07.440* :  and he did withdraw support, military support for Ukraine, that would cause huge problems for Ukraine,
*05:07.440- 05:12.940* :  and therefore European allies need to step up. And what Jens Stoltenberg is looking at is
*05:12.940- 05:21.700* :  creating a fund for five years of about 100 billion euros to fund Ukraine's military support
*05:21.700- 05:27.580* :  for the long term, and also taking over what the US has led at the moment, which is the coordination
*05:27.580- 05:33.260* :  of the supply of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. That's often referred to as Ramstein,
*05:33.260- 05:39.080* :  but getting NATO to be in charge of that and also helping with coordinating the training too
*05:39.080- 05:43.760* :  that has been done piecemeal by different countries, including the UK. So that's the focus.
*05:44.180- 05:47.360* :  Now they're not going to reach an agreement on, like here, they're going to discuss it,
*05:47.800- 05:52.640* :  and then they're hoping that when it comes to the summit, which will mark with heads of state
*05:52.640- 05:58.340* :  the 75th anniversary of NATO in Washington, where that treaty was signed, which has been brought
*05:58.340- 06:04.820* :  over here, by the way, is on show flown over here for the first time, that they will then be able
*06:05.200- 06:11.120* :  in July when the summit happens to agree a long-term plan of support for Ukraine. That is the plan.
*06:11.880- 06:17.300* :  The former Prime Minister of the UK, now foreign secretary David Cameron, is also in Brussels,
*06:18.040- 06:22.500* :  and he's been speaking to my colleagues on the BBC's podcast, Ukraine Cast.
*06:23.200- 06:29.420* :  Lucy Hawking started by asking whether there was a realistic prospect of NATO troops getting
*06:29.420- 06:36.680* :  involved in Ukraine. What NATO is looking at is a NATO mission for Ukraine, not a NATO mission
*06:36.680- 06:44.140* :  in Ukraine. It's making sure that we use NATO's architecture to help deliver some of the support
*06:44.140- 06:50.320* :  that Ukraine needs, but fundamentally I think that we should do everything we can to help Ukraine.
*06:50.320- 06:56.260* :  That's been Britain's position. I think it's not escalatory to say we are going to help this
*06:56.440- 07:01.240* :  independent sovereign country to fight off an aggressor, and we're going to give it all the
*07:01.240- 07:08.020* :  help we can in order to do that. As long as you stick to that, it isn't escalation. I would say
*07:08.020- 07:12.840* :  Britain's paid a really key role, actually, in proving it's not escalatory. Lots of people say,
*07:12.840- 07:17.780* :  oh, don't give them anti-tank weapons. We did. It wasn't escalation. It was right. Lots of people
*07:17.780- 07:22.060* :  said, don't give them long range artillery. We did. It wasn't escalation. It was right. And
*07:22.060- 07:27.440* :  same with the Stormshadowing missiles. We've helped Ukraine to fight off this illegal aggression.
*07:27.760- 07:31.640* :  You don't see the prospect of boots on the ground. Later boots on the ground in Ukraine.
*07:31.880- 07:40.980* :  No. I think that we don't want to give a put in a target like that, and NATO can do lots of
*07:40.980- 07:47.100* :  things to better coordinate the help we give to Ukraine, but fundamentally for countries
*07:47.500- 07:53.020* :  like Britain and all those supporters who came, this is a question of political will. Do we have
*07:53.020- 07:57.180* :  the patience? Do we have the will? Are we prepared to give them the resources? Now Britain's case
*07:57.180- 08:03.920* :  definitely the answer is yes. We've given over 7 billion. We've trained over 60,000 Ukrainian
*08:03.920- 08:07.960* :  soldiers in a program that goes back to my time as prime minister. We started that in 2014.
*08:08.900- 08:15.220* :  Fundamentally, add up all the countries back in Ukraine. We outmatch Russia's GDP by 25 to 1.
*08:15.280- 08:19.260* :  We've just got to make that difference count. But for people in Poland and people in the Baltic states,
*08:19.260- 08:25.440* :  they're really worried now about Russia attacking their countries. What is the plan at NATO and
*08:25.440- 08:31.080* :  here in Brussels if the war spilled over? Well, we have Article 5, that an attack on one is an
*08:31.080- 08:36.580* :  attack on all, and those countries are NATO members. And one of the things actually I did as
*08:36.580- 08:42.800* :  prime minister when Obama was president was very visibly stationed British troops on the eastern
*08:42.800- 08:47.060* :  flank, just as the Americans are very visibly stationed American troops on the eastern flank.
*08:47.060- 08:51.860* :  So I remember Obama saying, look, he's very important when Russia looks over the border
*08:52.400- 08:56.660* :  into the Baltic states. They don't just see Baltic state troops, they see British troops,
*08:56.660- 09:00.800* :  they see American troops, they see French and German troops. I think that's really, really important.
*09:00.860- 09:04.560* :  Is there a bit of an acknowledgement here in Brussels at the moment that the current plan is not
*09:04.560- 09:09.600* :  working? There's an acknowledgement that we've got to do more. And particularly those countries
*09:10.300- 09:15.360* :  that haven't done as much as some should do everything they can. And you can hear the full
*09:15.360- 09:23.320* :  interview with David Cameron on Ukrainecast, available today on BBC Sounds. Rebels in Myanmar say
*09:23.320- 09:28.300* :  they've launched a drone attack on the main military headquarters and the air force base in the
*09:28.300- 09:34.340* :  capital Nipadour. The National Unity Government, which represents the elected administration over
*09:34.340- 09:40.060* :  thrown in a coup three years ago, says it ordered the assault which involved nearly 30 drones.
*09:40.140- 09:45.480* :  The military authorities say they shot down seven, although one exploded near the runway
*09:45.480- 09:51.380* :  forcing the airport to close temporarily. Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head
*09:51.380- 09:57.420* :  told me the attack was bold but largely symbolic. But it's took the largest and most coordinated
*09:57.420- 10:02.360* :  drone attack we've seen so far. I mean, just as in Ukraine, drones have become a very important
*10:02.360- 10:08.040* :  weapon in a very uneven fight in Myanmar. All these various different opposition armed groups
*10:08.040- 10:14.020* :  have formed and taken up the fight against military government ever since the peaceful protest
*10:14.020- 10:20.140* :  movement was crashed three years ago. But they've got guns, they can pick up, they get a few on
*10:20.140- 10:24.020* :  the black market, they capture some. They've got a lot more weapons as they've gained territory,
*10:24.020- 10:29.040* :  but they're massively outgunned. The military has a very powerful air force, it uses a lot against
*10:29.040- 10:34.200* :  them. It has an awful lot of armored vehicles. So the drones are in some ways, it's a one bit of
*10:34.200- 10:38.960* :  technology they can get their hands on. And in fact, they make their own drones as well as bringing
*10:38.960- 10:43.840* :  in the bits and pieces in the parts over the border from China. And they've been using them quite
*10:43.840- 10:49.300* :  a bit. Most is a psychological tool against military bases when you put a drone over it, drop a
*10:49.300- 10:53.700* :  bomb, even if it's small, it can really scare the troops. But this was much more ambitious.
*10:54.280- 10:59.080* :  By going after the capital nepidor, even though it doesn't appear they've caused a lot of damage,
*10:59.080- 11:03.540* :  there was one bomb dropped near a runway, it closed the airport for a bit. This isn't an ordinary
*11:03.540- 11:08.880* :  capital city. This is a symbol of military power. It's a fortress-like capital that was built
*11:08.880- 11:14.920* :  by the military 15 to 20 years ago, precisely to render it invulnerable to a popular uprising.
*11:14.920- 11:19.260* :  So it's very powerful, symbolically, for these opposition forces to get this many drones
*11:19.780- 11:23.920* :  over the capital. And in some cases they appear to have been able to drop their explosives.
*11:24.520- 11:28.340* :  And what has been the government response to this? Well, they're not saying a great deal,
*11:28.340- 11:32.320* :  except that they're not acknowledging there's been any real damage. They probably hasn't
*11:32.320- 11:36.080* :  the drones can't carry very much. You know, these are relatively small drones. The most they can
*11:36.080- 11:42.320* :  carry is about 30 kilos. They are saying they shot down seven of the drones. Beyond that, I suspect
*11:42.320- 11:47.600* :  they'll need to figure out how they're going to shape a narrative that makes them look good. Because
*11:47.600- 11:52.360* :  of course, this shows their vulnerability. I mean, they've lost so much territory in the last
*11:52.780- 11:58.480* :  few months to advancing opposition forces armed groups in both the North and Shahn state and in
*11:58.480- 12:03.360* :  the Western Rakhine state. These are the most significant military reverses and defeats ever
*12:03.360- 12:08.260* :  suffered by the Myanmar military in its history. And now with drones over the actual military
*12:08.260- 12:13.040* :  citadel, the capital, it looks very bad. And I think they will take some time before they figure
*12:13.040- 12:15.840* :  out how they're going to present this to their own people in the state-run media.
*12:16.280- 12:21.760* :  Jonathan Head. After an Israeli striking Gaza killed seven humanitarian aid workers,
*12:21.760- 12:28.500* :  a UN agency says Israel has also struck its convoys in recent weeks. The claims have not been
*12:28.500- 12:34.440* :  independently verified, but Juliet Tumour from the UN's relief agency for Palestinians, Unra,
*12:34.440- 12:39.240* :  said their convoys had been hit at least three times in the last month.
*12:39.740- 12:46.580* :  There is a system in place where the United Nations gives quite a lot of detail to the Israeli
*12:46.580- 12:54.320* :  army on our movements. Despite this, at least on three occasions, Unra convoys over the past
*12:54.320- 13:01.620* :  months have been hit luckily without casualties. The aid convoy that was struck was from the world's
*13:01.620- 13:07.280* :  central kitchen. Its founder, Jose Andreas, said that had clear communication with the Israeli
*13:07.280- 13:15.460* :  military. So this was not a bad luck situation where we dropped the bomb in the wrong place.
*13:15.980- 13:23.820* :  This was over 1.5, 1.8 kilometers with a very defined humanitarian convoy that had signs in the top
*13:23.820- 13:30.380* :  in the roof. A very colorful logo that we are obviously very proud of, but that's very clear
*13:30.380- 13:37.060* :  who we are and what we do. Israel says it was a grave mistake, but the economy minister,
*13:37.060- 13:43.640* :  near Barcat, rejected the allegation that the world's central kitchen aid convoy had been deliberately
*13:44.860- 13:50.000* :  targeted. There's no way in the world that Israel would target people that come to get people
*13:50.000- 13:57.220* :  aid. That's nonsense. I'm sorry. Give us a bit of respect that we care about those people.
*13:57.220- 14:02.280* :  It's the same people that helped Israel. We will never target people like this. I'm sure that
*14:02.280- 14:06.340* :  there was a mistake done on the way. The Israeli army will interrogate this and give the families
*14:06.340- 14:12.960* :  of the people that are unfortunately were killed, all the details, and we want to make sure it
*14:12.960- 14:18.640* :  doesn't happen again. Monday's attack was met with worldwide international condemnation,
*14:19.120- 14:24.860* :  including from the U.S. President Joe Biden. He's due to speak with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*14:24.860- 14:31.700* :  Netanyahu by phone today. There's also pressure on the UK government to suspend arms sales to
*14:31.700- 14:37.600* :  Israel. More than 600 lawyers warned in a letter that the weapons could be used in violation
*14:37.660- 14:43.480* :  of international humanitarian law. From Jerusalem, here's our Middle East correspondent,
*14:43.480- 14:48.980* :  Yonan now. The drone attack which killed seven aid workers, including three Britons,
*14:48.980- 14:55.100* :  has shown a spotlight on the dangers facing relief organisations as they try to overt a man-made
*14:55.100- 15:01.240* :  famine in Gaza. The UN agency Unruha told the BBC that three of its convoys had come under attack
*15:01.240- 15:06.640* :  in recent months, without casualties, despite coordinating their movements with Israeli forces.
*15:06.700- 15:11.560* :  Countries whose citizens were killed in Monday's air strike have voiced strong criticism.
*15:11.560- 15:16.460* :  Australia's Prime Minister said Israel's explanation for the deaths was not good enough,
*15:16.460- 15:20.440* :  while Poland said there should be compensation paid to the victim's families.
*15:20.460- 15:26.660* :  An Israeli report which Downing Street hasn't confirmed says that Rishisunak warned Mr Netanyahu
*15:26.660- 15:32.180* :  that the UK would have to declare Israel in violation of international law if it didn't allow
*15:32.180- 15:39.960* :  more humanitarian aid into Gaza. Yonan now. Electronic sports or e-sports are on the rise,
*15:40.620- 15:45.920* :  and the industry is projected to grow by seven billion dollars by 2032.
*15:49.660- 15:55.140* :  That's the sound of one of the most popular games Fortnite, but what is the impact of a life
*15:55.140- 16:00.580* :  lived online? Jaden Ashman won a silver medal and just over a million dollars
*16:00.580- 16:07.800* :  at the 2019 Fortnite World Cup at the age of 15 has been speaking out about the damage
*16:07.800- 16:11.940* :  that years of gaming did to his health. Lucy Acheson reports.
*16:12.660- 16:17.860* :  I couldn't go outside and walk to the shops and stuff like I was just getting out of breath
*16:17.860- 16:22.200* :  and everything like that. Jaden says he started competing in e-sports to prove a point.
*16:22.560- 16:27.520* :  Obviously e-sports is a pretty new thing and most people especially parents and everything
*16:27.560- 16:31.600* :  don't really believe in it so it was nice to be able to prove that it is a real job.
*16:31.980- 16:35.620* :  And with his success he was able to make a huge difference to his mother's life.
*16:35.920- 16:39.700* :  Yeah I bought a house from my mum at 15 so it was yeah it was really good.
*16:39.860- 16:45.100* :  But at what cost? I was so competitive that instead of getting a good routine
*16:45.100- 16:50.120* :  and looking after my health I just put all of my energy into playing. At the time I was under
*16:50.120- 16:54.120* :  eating quite a lot I used to get in the zone and focus like quite a lot when I was playing

*17:24.800- 17:30.240* :  coming up on this podcast as veteran hard rockers kiss sell off their back catalog for
*17:30.240- 17:34.200* :  $300 million. We'll hear from co-founder Gene Simmons.
*17:34.800- 17:39.960* :  The people say money is the root of all evil. Don't understand it's actually the lack of money
*17:39.960- 17:45.180* :  that's the root of all evil. If you don't have money you can't improve anybody else's line.
*17:53.880- 17:58.600* :  Hey I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.
*17:58.840- 18:03.780* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally when they announce they'd be raising
*18:03.780- 18:08.960* :  their prices due to inflation we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

*18:38.420- 18:43.860* :  podcast helping you make sense of them. We've seen a crackdown on the opposition we've
*18:43.860- 18:48.380* :  seen an increase in censorship. That's the global jigsaw from the BBC World Service.
*18:48.760- 18:52.960* :  Listen now by searching for the explanation wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:58.540- 19:04.720* :  A building tilting at a crazy angle almost impossibly has featured strongly in the picture feeds
*19:04.720- 19:11.080* :  coming into the BBC here today. It's in Taiwan after an earthquake struck yesterday
*19:11.080- 19:17.680* :  the most powerful for a quarter of a century. Emergency workers say more than 600 people
*19:17.680- 19:22.600* :  are still trapped. Nine people were killed and more than a thousand injured.
*19:23.300- 19:27.880* :  Just before we recorded this podcast our correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes
*19:28.140- 19:34.400* :  centers this update from Waleon near the epicenter. This is now night number two of
*19:35.140- 19:42.240* :  after the earthquake and it's just started to rain likely here in Waleon. Rain will make the
*19:42.240- 19:47.240* :  efforts to rescue people even harder than they have been which has been extremely hard already.
*19:47.900- 19:55.000* :  This is an operation going on around the clock and it is really an operation that is just going
*19:55.000- 19:59.940* :  as fast as it can. They're sending teams in, they're bringing teams out. As the teams come out
*19:59.940- 20:04.400* :  they bring the injured people out. Some of them lightly injured if they've been more heavily injured
*20:04.400- 20:09.180* :  they're taken to hospital by ambulance. But I think what's been really surprising to all of us
*20:09.180- 20:12.860* :  here today is we thought there were about a hundred people trapped up there in the mountains
*20:12.860- 20:19.940* :  and that has suddenly jumped to around 650 at around the middle of the day today and that's
*20:20.240- 20:25.160* :  quite been quite a shock to everybody here because that is a much much bigger task for the rescue
*20:25.160- 20:30.880* :  teams to track down where all those people are. That landscape up there is just so so rugged. I
*20:30.880- 20:36.660* :  have been up there several times before and it is one of the most rugged landscapes in eastern Asia.
*20:37.400- 20:43.580* :  So you know the task facing the rescue teams to get to people is just a very complicated one.
*20:44.280- 20:50.900* :  Rupert Wingfield Hayes. Not a Veewear, Mappissa and Cacula. South Africa's now former speaker
*20:50.900- 20:57.400* :  apparlament has been released on bail after appearing in court in Pretoria on corruption offences.
*20:57.960- 21:04.000* :  She was arrested earlier today after being accused of soliciting bribes in return for awarding
*21:04.000- 21:09.440* :  contracts during her time as Defence Minister. She resigned as Speaker on Wednesday.
*21:10.080- 21:14.460* :  I heard more about the case from Jenny Hill, our correspondent in Johannesburg.
*21:15.080- 21:21.120* :  This case has dominated headlines here for more than two weeks since police officers who were
*21:21.120- 21:26.440* :  investigating corruption allegations raided her home. She's been under considerable pressure
*21:26.440- 21:32.860* :  to resign and she's capitulated to that pressure last night standing down. But as she did so,
*21:32.860- 21:39.180* :  she insisted that the move was in no way an admission of guilt. She denies any wrongdoing.
*21:39.600- 21:42.940* :  And how significant to figure how she been in South African politics.
*21:45.040- 21:50.880* :  You'll find her described as a veteran of the African National Congress party, the ANC,
*21:50.880- 21:56.320* :  which of course is governs South Africa for the last 30 years. You know, she's an older
*21:56.320- 22:02.960* :  politician. She's been a minister as Speaker. She was one of the most powerful political figures
*22:02.960- 22:10.480* :  in the country, actually behind the President, really only third down from Cyril Ramaphosa.
*22:10.960- 22:16.500* :  So, you know, she's really topped the echelons of that party. And as such, these charges being
*22:16.500- 22:22.740* :  leveled against her have caused enormous scandal, forcing all sorts of questions about the trust
*22:22.740- 22:27.620* :  readiness of, well, the party itself, which has long been dogs by corruption allegations.
*22:28.280- 22:33.680* :  So, it is a really hugely significant moment in South African politics, not least, of course,
*22:33.680- 22:37.900* :  because this country goes to the polls in a national election at the end of May. So,
*22:37.900- 22:43.220* :  really just weeks away from what polls predict could be a very bruising election for the ANC.
*22:44.100- 22:51.440* :  Jenny Hill in Johannesburg, the Nigeria National Youth Service, or NYSE, is a one-year
*22:51.440- 22:57.800* :  national service program that's mandatory for university graduates. Typically, NYSE students
*22:57.800- 23:02.980* :  will spare most of the year working in schools, hospitals, or in infrastructure development.
*23:03.660- 23:09.500* :  Usually, in remote rural areas, far from their homes. But as Nigeria descends further into a
*23:09.500- 23:17.100* :  kidnapping crisis, many young NYSE recruits are scared they will be targeted along Nigeria's roads.
*23:17.100- 23:23.240* :  The BBC's Frey Lindsay has been talking to one young recruit who we've called patience.
*23:23.900- 23:26.820* :  We've voiced over her words to protect her identity.
*23:27.560- 23:31.900* :  Patience is a university graduate in her early 20s from the south of Nigeria.
*23:32.860- 23:38.240* :  Before taking up her main NYSE posting, patients had to go to a weeks-long orientation camp
*23:38.240- 23:43.980* :  in central Nigeria. Her mother saw her off as she boarded a bus for the roughly 500 kilometer
*23:43.980- 23:49.000* :  journey. Although she knew kidnappings had happened on this road, she told me she wasn't nervous,
*23:49.500- 23:55.660* :  but something did happen. We heard a gunshot, the driver just stopped and then they came
*23:55.660- 24:00.080* :  closer to us and asked everybody to come down from the bus. They made us sit on the floor,
*24:00.080- 24:05.300* :  then they asked us to bring out everything we had. They gave us our phones back and told us to
*24:05.300- 24:10.520* :  phone our guardians and our parents, so then I called my dad. The kidnappers were looking for a
*24:10.520- 24:15.580* :  ransom, of course, and because they recognised that patience was perhaps a bit wealthier than
*24:15.580- 24:20.320* :  the others, they wanted more money for her release. For some people they asked 10 to 15 million
*24:20.320- 24:26.580* :  nires or around 7 to 10 thousand US dollars, but for patience, they wanted 20 million nires,
*24:26.640- 24:31.820* :  just over 13 thousand dollars. They told my dad that if he didn't pay 20 million nires,
*24:31.820- 24:34.860* :  they were going to kill me. At the time I was just crying.
*24:35.460- 24:39.960* :  On the other side of that phone call was Desmond, patience's father, also not his real name.
*24:40.360- 24:46.000* :  My daughter called and said they were kidnapped and they were asking for ransom and I asked
*24:46.000- 24:53.540* :  almost and he took the phone, this guy said 20 million and I said to him, if I had 20 million,
*24:53.540- 24:58.240* :  you would find my daughter to kidnapped. She would be flying to the nearest airport and then she would
*24:58.240- 25:03.860* :  be coming to that street with escorts, military escorts. They don't have that kind of money
*25:04.840- 25:10.780* :  and they turn off the phone again. They negotiated for nine days. Patients spent most of that time
*25:10.780- 25:15.400* :  sleeping on the ground outside with the other hostages in several locations in the forest,
*25:15.400- 25:20.480* :  but she was eventually released after Desmond negotiated a ransom he could manage.
*25:20.860- 25:25.780* :  Dozens of NYSE recruits like Patients have been kidnapped along Nigeria's country roads in recent
*25:25.780- 25:31.480* :  years, with some still in captivity to this day. It's of course not just NYSE corpus who are vulnerable
*25:31.480- 25:36.480* :  in Nigeria. Kidnapping is at record levels and now threatens people all across the country,
*25:36.940- 25:43.740* :  but corpus particular vulnerability comes from being corpus. NYSE recruits are almost by definition
*25:43.740- 25:50.140* :  wealthier than the average, then Nigeria's middle class and up. Frey Lindsay, the NYSE and the
*25:50.140- 25:56.920* :  Nigerian interior ministry were asked to comment but did not respond. Analysis shows political
*25:56.920- 26:02.220* :  action has helped reduce the number of trees being brought down in the tropical forests of
*26:02.220- 26:08.460* :  Brazil and Colombia, vital to tackling climate change. The study from the University of Maryland
*26:08.460- 26:14.160* :  and the World Resources Institute says that the election of President Lourid de Silva in Brazil
*26:14.220- 26:20.520* :  led to a 39 percent fall in logging in the Brazilian Amazon. Our environment correspondent
*26:20.540- 26:26.380* :  Matt McGraw has more details. The world saw a big increase in overall tree losses last year,
*26:26.380- 26:31.540* :  mainly because of unprecedented wildfires in Canada. But researchers say that the deliberate
*26:31.540- 26:36.860* :  removal of trees in mature tropical forests like the Amazon is far more important when it comes
*26:36.860- 26:42.640* :  to climate change. That's because these trees contain vast stores of carbon. Last year saw the
*26:42.640- 26:47.880* :  loss of around 10 football pitches a minute of these tropical trees globally, but in both Brazil
*26:47.880- 26:53.700* :  and Colombia there were hopeful signs of progress. Since President Lula returned to office in Brazil
*26:54.140- 27:00.000* :  logging fell by more than a third. In Colombia tree-felling was cut in half under President Gustavo
*27:00.000- 27:06.960* :  Petro Reigo, but clearing trees for agriculture and large-scale wildfires drove record losses in
*27:06.960- 27:15.180* :  Bolivia, Laos and Nicaragua. Matt McGraw. KISS are known for their hard rock anthems and extravagant
*27:15.180- 27:21.300* :  use of makeup, and they become the latest band to strike a hugely lucrative deal for the rights
*27:21.300- 27:27.440* :  to their back catalogue. Paul Stanley and Jean Simmons, who founded the rock band in 1973,
*27:27.820- 27:34.860* :  are believed to have received more than $300 million from the Swedish music investor
*27:35.280- 27:38.060* :  Pop House Entertainment. Ella Begnell reports.
*27:47.740- 27:53.480* :  What can $300 million buy you? We will be able to pay our rent.
*27:53.920- 27:59.520* :  That's Jean Simmons, also known as the demon, the bassist and co-frontman for the rock group KISS.
*27:59.880- 28:04.660* :  The band have sold their music catalog, brand name and trademarks, including their black and white
*28:04.660- 28:10.340* :  face paint look, striking a lucrative deal with Swedish music investor Pop House Entertainment,
*28:10.380- 28:13.800* :  but they're not the only music artist to sell their work.
*28:20.820- 28:26.380* :  In 2020, Stevie Nicks reportedly sold a majority stake to her back catalogue in a deal worth
*28:26.460- 28:27.440* :  $100 million.
*28:34.680- 28:40.280* :  Two years later, Bob Dylan made upwards of $400 million when he sold the publishing rights to his
*28:40.380- 28:42.900* :  songs, but now it's KISS's turn.
*28:48.540- 28:52.540* :  Jean Simmons says they would only sell the rights to people. They trust it.
*28:52.900- 28:56.720* :  For any amount of money, we wouldn't get in bed with the wrong folks.
*28:57.180- 29:02.300* :  The last thing you want after you created the band, you always dreamed of putting together
*29:02.920- 29:07.120* :  handing it over to somebody for any amount of money. That doesn't work, especially people you don't
*29:07.120- 29:13.880* :  like. So the best thing about this deal is who we're doing the deal with, about the collaborative
*29:13.880- 29:18.900* :  nature, and about how we've met our newest best friends for the rest of our lives.
*29:24.240- 29:29.600* :  Pop House Entertainment was founded by Abersinger Björn Ulveus, who made millions in recent years
*29:29.600- 29:34.780* :  from their concerts featuring avatars, something that appeals to Simmons to achieve rock and roll
*29:34.780- 29:41.220* :  immortality. Taking AI where it's never been before. You know, there's business and then there's
*29:41.220- 29:47.900* :  the idea of blowing the socks off your fans, and that's the commitment we get from all the folks.
*29:47.900- 29:54.400* :  They want to take us into areas we never imagine. Pop House says it has plans for a movie based on
*29:54.400- 29:59.660* :  the band's story, an avatar show and a KISS themed experience, which was already in the works.
*29:59.660- 30:05.040* :  The financial terms of the deal haven't been made public, but the BBC understands it's worth
*30:05.040- 30:10.980* :  more than three hundred million dollars, an all-time record for a group, and Simmons is an
*30:10.980- 30:18.620* :  embarrassed about the sum. More money is always good. I completely reject the idea that if you work
*30:18.640- 30:24.380* :  hard, that you shouldn't make more money. The people who should make the most amount of money
*30:24.380- 30:30.100* :  work the hardest. People say money is the root of all evil. It's actually the lack of money that's
*30:30.100- 30:42.340* :  the root of all evil. Ella Bicknell reporting. And that's all for us for now, but there will be
