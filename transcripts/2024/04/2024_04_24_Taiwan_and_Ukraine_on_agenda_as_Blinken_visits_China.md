*01:19.880- 01:25.000* :  I'm Andrew Peach, and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday, the 24th of April, these are our main
*01:25.000- 01:25.600* :  stories.
*01:26.140- 01:30.660* :  America's top diplomat is visiting China with a warning against support for Russia.
*01:31.240- 01:35.860* :  President Biden promises more weapons for Ukraine after the Senate approved a multi-billion
*01:35.860- 01:41.580* :  dollar aid package, and Australian police arrest 17 ages in counterterrorism operations.
*01:44.080- 01:48.600* :  Also in this podcast, its bosses say they lead a sustainable company, but now Brazil
*01:48.600- 01:52.180* :  has been taken to court over its environmental record.
*01:54.140- 01:58.780* :  This was a lake three meters deep, where we had a project to raise fish.
*01:59.140- 02:04.420* :  After the mine started extracting their waste came down and fell into the spring.
*02:04.920- 02:10.260* :  And did artificial intelligence help discover the grave of the father of Western philosophy?
*02:13.980- 02:18.520* :  The status of Taiwan, the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, just some of
*02:18.520- 02:18.900* :  the issues.
*02:19.100- 02:23.360* :  The world's two biggest economies, the US and China don't agree on, so it's not going
*02:23.360- 02:27.600* :  to be an easy trip for the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who's in China for
*02:27.640- 02:28.260* :  key talks.
*02:28.900- 02:33.800* :  While Mr. Blinken was on his way to Shanghai, Congress in Washington approved a major US foreign
*02:33.800- 02:38.160* :  aid package, which included more help for Taiwan, and that's angered the Chinese.
*02:38.340- 02:41.040* :  Is there foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin?
*02:45.580- 02:49.780* :  I'd like to emphasize that the strengthening of military ties between the United States
*02:49.780- 02:56.160* :  and Taiwan will not bring about security for Taiwan, nor can it save the doomed fate
*02:56.160- 02:57.600* :  of Taiwan independence.
*02:58.060- 03:03.800* :  It will only increase tensions and the risk of conflict across the Taiwan Strait, and
*03:03.800- 03:07.360* :  will ultimately be an act of shooting oneself in the foot.
*03:07.760- 03:12.460* :  A China correspondent Laura Bicke says the issue of Taiwan remains a major sticking point
*03:12.460- 03:14.040* :  between the US and Beijing.
*03:14.740- 03:16.340* :  For China, it is a red line.
*03:16.380- 03:22.240* :  They see the self-governing island as part of China and that the United States should
*03:22.240- 03:23.300* :  not get involved.
*03:23.860- 03:28.140* :  And the latest aid package, they say, is a betrayal of that policy.
*03:28.140- 03:33.640* :  They say that it will encourage separatism within Taiwan, and they will push against it
*03:33.860- 03:34.140* :  strongly.
*03:34.380- 03:37.160* :  So I think that will be the key message from Beijing side.
*03:37.740- 03:43.400* :  Lots on Mr. Blinken's agenda, Laura, including trying to warn China off, getting involved
*03:43.400- 03:44.680* :  in Russia's war in Ukraine.
*03:45.520- 03:50.780* :  China says it is not giving any weapons to Russia, and certainly they say they have not
*03:50.780- 03:54.040* :  given any weapons since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*03:54.040- 04:03.000* :  But the US says that China is providing components in its trade with Russia that Russia could
*04:03.000- 04:03.920* :  use as weapons.
*04:03.920- 04:10.980* :  They want that to stop, and they want to find a way for China to work with Washington
*04:10.980- 04:15.480* :  to persuade Russia to come to the table and look at peace talks.
*04:15.480- 04:22.240* :  So I think that's one thing on Anthony Blinken's agenda that will be pretty tough for China
*04:22.240- 04:24.760* :  and the United States to get on the same page about.
*04:25.380- 04:30.800* :  And just stepping back from the specifics, how do you assess the state of US-China relations
*04:30.800- 04:31.560* :  right now?
*04:32.960- 04:36.100* :  I think both sides are trying to take steps towards one another.
*04:36.100- 04:39.700* :  These are very tentative steps, and every time they take a step forward, something else
*04:39.700- 04:42.900* :  comes along to kind of derail them from their path.
*04:42.900- 04:48.420* :  I think it's going to be very difficult for both sides to find a way to work together,
*04:48.420- 04:51.020* :  but they are managing to find bright spots.
*04:51.400- 04:54.500* :  Climate change, they can work together on climate change issues.
*04:54.800- 04:59.320* :  But when it comes to trade, when it comes to Taiwan, the South China Sea, the Middle East,
*04:59.320- 05:04.640* :  and Ukraine, all these big issues, taking steps towards one another is very, very difficult.
*05:04.740- 05:10.400* :  The world wants these two superpowers to find a way, and both of them do want to come
*05:10.400- 05:11.100* :  to some agreement.
*05:11.100- 05:15.820* :  For the United States, it's about finding a way to work with China as well as compete
*05:15.820- 05:16.400* :  with China.
*05:16.400- 05:21.160* :  And for China, they want American businesses to come and thrive here.
*05:21.480- 05:25.320* :  So there are common interests there, it's just finding a way to get to it.
*05:25.700- 05:28.380* :  Our China correspondent Laura Bicke with me from Beijing.
*05:29.240- 05:34.620* :  The United States Senate has approved three major aid packages for Ukraine, Israel, and
*05:34.620- 05:35.160* :  Taiwan.
*05:35.220- 05:40.380* :  President Joe Biden said the deals, which total almost $100 billion, show his country
*05:40.380- 05:42.520* :  stands against tyranny and oppression.
*05:43.160- 05:47.660* :  He said, more military assistance will be sent to Ukraine within days after he signs the
*05:48.240- 05:48.900* :  legislation into law.
*05:48.900- 05:52.720* :  The Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised the passing of the bill.
*05:53.340- 05:55.240* :  This is an inflection point in history.
*05:56.060- 06:01.220* :  Western democracy faces perhaps the greatest test since the end of the Cold War, and this
*06:01.220- 06:03.880* :  supplemental is essential to meeting the challenges.
*06:04.760- 06:09.280* :  Failure to pass the supplemental would have been a gift to Putin, to Iran, to Xi, and
*06:09.280- 06:13.160* :  her to America politically, militarily, economically, and culturally.
*06:13.160- 06:20.940* :  I'm glad that when it mattered most, finally, finally, finally, both parties came together
*06:20.940- 06:23.600* :  to do the right thing in our nation's security.
*06:24.040- 06:28.300* :  Under the America correspondent Peter Boes told us the bill was passed despite opposition
*06:28.300- 06:29.400* :  from some Republicans.
*06:30.260- 06:37.140* :  This was a long time in coming held up for months, in large part by Republicans in the
*06:37.140- 06:42.680* :  House, some of whom would rather see more money spent here in the United States on immigration
*06:42.680- 06:48.580* :  and on the issues affecting the southern border of the U.S. with Mexico, but it has seemed
*06:48.580- 06:54.460* :  to have been a change of heart amongst some Republicans, notably the Speaker of the
*06:54.460- 06:59.880* :  House, which allowed it to pass through that stage, that part of Congress, at the weekend,
*07:00.340- 07:05.160* :  now, Robert Stumpch, you could say, or at least passed in the upper house, the Senate
*07:05.160- 07:10.980* :  as well, just remains for it to be signed into law by President Biden, and the President
*07:10.980- 07:16.620* :  already issuing a statement indicating that that military aid that President Zelensky
*07:16.620- 07:19.540* :  and Ukraine has said that is so desperately needed.
*07:19.540- 07:25.300* :  That military aid will be on the way, were told by the end of this week, defense weaponry
*07:25.300- 07:27.700* :  in particular that is so desperately needed.
*07:27.700- 07:31.660* :  That's part of the $61 billion package for Ukraine.
*07:31.820- 07:39.840* :  Then there's 26 billion for Israel, also humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza, and about
*07:39.840- 07:47.880* :  8 billion for Taiwan to stave off potential advances by China and some of the issues in
*07:47.880- 07:49.620* :  the Indo-Pacific reason.
*07:50.060- 07:55.260* :  One of the measures in this bill, perhaps most controversial for some Americans, at least,
*07:55.680- 08:01.820* :  is the potential ban on TikTok, and this is part of the security measure that is part
*08:01.820- 08:08.460* :  of this very large bill, with essentially an ultimatum to Biden, which is the Chinese
*08:08.460- 08:15.120* :  company that owns TikTok, that they should divest and sell the platform to an American
*08:15.580- 08:18.800* :  owner or face a ban in this country.
*08:18.840- 08:23.800* :  Now, nothing is really going to happen quickly, it's quite likely that Biden's will take
*08:23.800- 08:27.080* :  this to the courts, claim that this move is unconstitutional.
*08:27.500- 08:33.220* :  And also suggests that the concerns of Americans that are misplaced, or the concerns of Washington
*08:33.220- 08:39.580* :  are misplaced, and that is that the Chinese government could invoke security measures to
*08:39.580- 08:45.860* :  in some way get hold of the personal data of Americans that is part of that app.
*08:46.060- 08:51.300* :  The fact that Biden said that they've already taken measures to ensure that that doesn't
*08:51.300- 08:51.620* :  happen.
*08:52.020- 08:56.900* :  Unorth America correspondent Peter Bose, so how has this news gone down in Kiev, especially
*08:56.900- 09:01.660* :  in view of new Russian missile attacks on Ukraine's second city, Harkiv, during the
*09:01.660- 09:01.940* :  night?
*09:02.300- 09:04.640* :  Are Ukraine correspondent is James Waterhouse?
*09:05.380- 09:11.460* :  It's two hurdles out of three cleared now for this enormous $60 billion military package
*09:11.460- 09:16.840* :  coming from America, President Zelensky, has described the U.S. as being a beacon for
*09:16.840- 09:22.300* :  the free world, and almost cementing itself as a major supporter of democracy.
*09:23.020- 09:27.180* :  He's once again extended his thanks to the U.S. Senate on this occasion, but we've seen
*09:27.180- 09:31.680* :  a change in tone from him, really, where with his evening addresses, and when he speaks
*09:31.680- 09:36.660* :  to press conferences, of late he's been sort of pleading for help, but now he's planning.
*09:36.660- 09:41.860* :  He's very much in planning mode, he's announcing different defense contracts being drawn up.
*09:42.320- 09:47.360* :  Most of this package will involve ammunition, missiles, shells, air defense systems, which
*09:47.360- 09:52.940* :  will allow Ukraine to sort of re-ignite its war, potentially, but I think what's widely
*09:52.940- 09:59.540* :  accepted is that the goal for 2024 is simply to try and hold the line once more to try
*09:59.540- 10:04.920* :  and stop these Russian advances before, in the hopes of Kiev, shaping for more liberations
*10:04.920- 10:09.980* :  next year. But Ukraine has been here before, a counter-offensive has been talked up before,
*10:10.600- 10:15.780* :  and what Russia has proven is that it can hold on to what it has taken. So I think we're
*10:15.780- 10:20.460* :  in a week where it's been significant for Ukraine in a diplomatic sense, in that this
*10:20.460- 10:25.380* :  is a huge moment, the return of America, which keeps Ukraine in this fight, but it also
*10:25.380- 10:29.160* :  extends the duration of what has been a grueling war.
*10:29.600- 10:33.560* :  But it's interesting to think that even this sort of amount of money, tens of billions
*10:33.560- 10:42.200* :  of dollars, may not be enough to have a game-changing effect on the conflict, just to hold Russia
*10:42.200- 10:43.420* :  at bay for a bit longer.
*10:43.540- 10:47.760* :  This is the fact of the battlefield, really, where in the six months of political delays in
*10:47.760- 10:54.660* :  Washington, we have seen Russia continue with its so-called meat-grined tactics of launching
*10:54.660- 10:58.800* :  wave after wave of soldiers to try and take as much Ukrainian territory as possible.
*10:59.320- 11:05.240* :  Incrucially, for Ukraine, settlements have fallen, towns like Abdivka, and more and more villages,
*11:05.900- 11:11.400* :  places that are continually reduced to rubble, and it brings other cities into the firing line.
*11:11.460- 11:16.180* :  So to change that, when your back is facing the enemy, if you like, and where you have
*11:16.180- 11:22.620* :  Ukrainian forces building new defensive lines, new trenches, that takes time to turn around.
*11:23.320- 11:26.860* :  The former heavy armed forces here said, for the deadlock to be broken,
*11:27.780- 11:33.260* :  several innovations need to happen at once, being it technological, the use of drones,
*11:33.260- 11:36.540* :  weapons manufacturing, smart military thinking.
*11:37.340- 11:39.900* :  And from James Waterhouse in Kiev to Berlin.
*11:47.920- 11:51.540* :  The British Prime Minister Rishisunak has been greeted with officials and military honours
*11:51.540- 11:54.560* :  on his way to a meeting with the German Chancellor Olaf Schultz.
*11:54.880- 11:59.460* :  Ukraine and the Middle East on the agenda of course, but Mr Schultz also touched on the issue
*11:59.760- 12:04.380* :  of defence spending. We stand here today together as the leading defence
*12:04.380- 12:11.380* :  spenders in Europe, unshakable NATO allies, and the two largest military supporters of Ukraine
*12:11.380- 12:17.360* :  in Europe. And together we will continue to provide unwavering support for our Ukrainian friends,
*12:17.820- 12:19.900* :  as you said, for as long as it takes.
*12:20.520- 12:24.740* :  I asked her Berlin correspondent Jessica Parker, what else had come out of that news conference?
*12:25.600- 12:30.700* :  Yeah, I mean it was a pretty friendly news conference. Both men actually attempting each
*12:30.700- 12:36.260* :  other's language at one point, Rishisunak saying, mind-froind as he addressed Olaf Schultz the
*12:36.260- 12:41.420* :  chance to hear in Berlin. And look, the main issue as expected that they talked about and what
*12:41.420- 12:46.960* :  asked about was defence. Lots of compliments going back and forth about things that Germany's
*12:46.960- 12:52.240* :  done to help Ukraine, things that the UK has done to help Ukraine, but of course actually
*12:53.040- 12:57.660* :  this is all the sort of diplomatic nicety, but there have been tensions in the past about
*12:57.660- 13:01.760* :  respective aid. So for example, Germany's still refusing to send
*13:01.760- 13:07.820* :  Taurus Cruz missiles to Ukraine, Olaf Schultz reiterating again today when asked that he wasn't
*13:07.820- 13:12.340* :  going to send those long-range missiles. I think when you speak to officials in private to the
*13:12.340- 13:19.160* :  Brits of frustration, and then of course Rishisunak announcing 2.5 percent bending target for UK
*13:19.160- 13:25.260* :  by the end of the decade yesterday puts a bit of pressure on Germany, but I mean they've only
*13:25.260- 13:30.500* :  just hit 2 percent themselves this year for the first time since the early 90s. But look,
*13:30.840- 13:37.260* :  that being said, I think there was a big effort to show unity for Ukraine, send a message to President
*13:37.460- 13:41.880* :  Putin. And I think also send a message across the Atlantic as well that Europe is starting to
*13:41.880- 13:46.120* :  really take its defence and security seriously. So Britain and Germany are big contributors to
*13:46.520- 13:51.080* :  Ukraine and a spending a large amount of public money here with these announcements, but it's
*13:51.080- 13:56.960* :  dwarfed by what's just come from the US. Yeah, I mean the US is by a country mile. When you look at
*13:56.960- 14:02.020* :  things like the key institute that sort of tracks donation pledges is far out ahead, but the $60
*14:02.020- 14:09.280* :  billion package of aid for Ukraine obviously got stuck in Congress for months, and that was very
*14:09.280- 14:13.440* :  bad news for Kiev. Obviously they've been struggling on the battlefield against Russia,
*14:13.980- 14:21.300* :  but I think it also probably sharpened the challenge here in Europe and the start realization that
*14:21.780- 14:25.420* :  and some leaders speak about this more openly than others. They were pretty diplomatic again
*14:25.420- 14:30.380* :  today about, for example, the prospect of a Trump presidency going forward, but I think it does
*14:30.380- 14:36.480* :  make European leaders realise that they need to be more self-reliant, not just in terms of supporting
*14:36.480- 14:41.720* :  Ukraine, but also just supporting themselves. There was a pretty unfavorable report recently about
*14:41.720- 14:46.420* :  the state of Germany's armed forces. So there's a wide recognition here that there's much more
*14:46.420- 14:50.940* :  that Germany needs to do, and of course not just about spending, spending large sums of money,
*14:50.940- 14:55.520* :  it's about spending it well and countries in the NATO military alliance, looking at each other's
*14:55.520- 14:59.660* :  different capacities, which is why these countries have to keep talking about exactly what they're
*14:59.660- 15:05.420* :  doing and what they're spending the money on. Jessica Parker with me from Berlin. Campus protests in
*15:05.420- 15:10.900* :  the United States against the war in Gaza have spread from Colombia and Yale to other universities
*15:10.900- 15:16.600* :  as officials attempt to calm or growing and impart aggressive movement. On Monday, police broke up
*15:16.600- 15:21.780* :  a demonstration at New York University and made dozens of arrests. The university said it received
*15:21.780- 15:27.660* :  reports of intimidating chance and anti-Semitic incidents. Protests groups say their criticism is
*15:27.660- 15:33.180* :  not anti-Semitic and is reserved for the Israeli state and its supporters. Here's our North America
*15:33.180- 15:39.680* :  editor Sarah Smith. When police clashed with students outside New York University and arrested
*15:39.680- 15:44.300* :  over a hundred of them when they wouldn't leave, it created another flashpoint in the spreading
*15:44.300- 15:52.040* :  pro-Palestinian campus protest. In the beautiful spring sunshine, the NYU students took up
*15:52.040- 15:59.700* :  their placards once again to show their defiance. Esma Ben Gapsia is a protest organizer who described
*15:59.700- 16:04.520* :  to me what happened. The police brutality was egregious and extraordinary. Police officers have
*16:04.520- 16:09.240* :  arrested students, maced them. There were students there with medical challenges and disabilities.
*16:13.200- 16:17.700* :  Some Jewish students have complained that the protests are intimidating and say they have
*16:17.700- 16:22.540* :  faced harassment and anti-Semitism on campus. I'm scared to wear a Jewish star here. I've got
*16:23.320- 16:30.300* :  very nasty anti-Semitic comments at me and I just don't understand how this is accepted.
*16:32.940- 16:37.840* :  Many of the protesters in New York are wearing COVID star masks to hide their faces because they
*16:37.840- 16:42.580* :  say they've been bullied online if they've been recognized. Dylan is a demonstrator who didn't want
*16:42.580- 16:48.660* :  to give his surname for the same reason. We are facing very good, very well-organized Zionist
*16:48.660- 16:55.160* :  agitators who weaponize their claim of Jewishness in order to shut down what is legitimate protest.
*16:55.600- 16:59.840* :  Accusations of intolerance from both sides are a common feature of these demonstrations.
*17:00.680- 17:06.160* :  It looks like this may now be growing into a nationwide movement because every time one of these
*17:06.160- 17:12.280* :  protests has been broken up, it's simply inspired more demonstrations on more campuses right across
*17:12.280- 17:20.080* :  America. Protests have spread to universities right across the US. From Yale on the East Coast
*17:20.080- 17:25.180* :  where almost 50 students were arrested last night, to California State University Humboldt
*17:25.400- 17:29.600* :  where students barricaded themselves inside a building and the police were sent in to remove them.
*17:30.760- 17:35.940* :  Calling the cops is a highly controversial move on any campus where students demand their right
*17:35.940- 17:44.040* :  to protest. In New York Columbia University has taken some classes online as campus protests
*17:44.040- 17:49.520* :  continue there and look set to carry on. Universities across the country are now braced for even
*17:49.520- 17:55.300* :  bigger protests disrupting graduation ceremonies this summer. Unorth America editor Sarah Smith reporting.
*17:57.280- 18:03.660* :  Still to come on this podcast, mass protests in Argentina over a day facto cut in university funding.

*18:49.340- 18:53.400* :  They said yes. And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*18:53.400- 18:58.940* :  owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t.

*19:17.400- 19:21.520* :  The police in Sydney have arrested seven people as part of a counterterrorism operation.
*19:21.520- 19:26.180* :  The detentions follow a series of raids carried out by the Australian security forces
*19:26.620- 19:29.760* :  in the aftermath of the stabbing of a bishop in a church last week.
*19:29.760- 19:35.360* :  The police send the suspects or aged under 18 were part of a network that shared a violent,
*19:35.360- 19:39.860* :  extremist ideology. They were the police said motivated by religion.
*19:40.360- 19:43.260* :  Our correspondent in Sydney Phil Mercer gave me more details.
*19:44.140- 19:51.120* :  This is coming off raids on more than a dozen houses in Sydney and also in another community
*19:51.120- 19:55.860* :  called Golben which is on the way to Canberra here in eastern Australia.
*19:55.900- 20:04.140* :  Now these seven suspects are aged 15, 16 and 17 and the police alleged that they follow this
*20:04.140- 20:12.060* :  religiously motivated violent extremist ideology similar to that of a teenager arrested
*20:12.100- 20:17.520* :  following a stabbing at a church here in Sydney just over a week ago.
*20:17.520- 20:22.340* :  That 16-year-old boy has been charged with terrorism offences.
*20:22.900- 20:27.800* :  Now these 17 ages apparently under surveillance by the authorities,
*20:28.500- 20:34.700* :  but the intelligence service here in Australia says that this group was such a danger to the
*20:34.700- 20:40.640* :  community that they posed an unacceptable risk to the people of New South Wales prompting
*20:40.640- 20:46.020* :  these raids by more than 400 officers here in Sydney and in Golben.
*20:46.340- 20:51.420* :  And this extremist network therein, is that all teenagers or is it a one-way
*20:51.420- 20:53.400* :  to range of ages than that involved in it?
*20:53.860- 21:00.300* :  Well investigators are stressing that they believe further raids and potentially further arrests
*21:00.420- 21:08.400* :  will be made so at the moment it seems that we have an alleged cell made up of teenagers.
*21:08.420- 21:15.820* :  Now investigators believe that it was likely an attack may have been about to take place
*21:15.820- 21:22.480* :  no specific target has been identified, but the authorities do say that any alleged
*21:22.480- 21:30.060* :  conspiracy is not linked to Anzac Day that takes place on Thursday that commemorates Australia's
*21:30.420- 21:35.820* :  military veterans along with those from New Zealand or any other religious events.
*21:35.920- 21:41.540* :  An Australia's national terror threat level remains that possible, this is the second
*21:41.540- 21:44.460* :  lowest rating in a five category system.
*21:45.220- 21:51.280* :  Anzac Day is certainly a big deal in Sydney, I've been there for it myself and the police,
*21:51.280- 21:55.140* :  as you say, are distancing any suggestion that this is anything to do with that?
*21:55.980- 22:03.080* :  Yes and they say that it's targeting radicalisation, not religion, this is part of an investigation
*22:03.160- 22:10.800* :  into a stabbing of a bishop and three other people at an Assyrian orthodox church hearing
*22:10.980- 22:18.620* :  in Sydney on Monday of last week and that led to very serious disturbances outside of the church
*22:18.740- 22:25.780* :  and the authorities say that the investigation into that alleged act of terror has led them to today's
*22:25.920- 22:29.180* :  raid in which 17 ages have been arrested.
*22:29.860- 22:34.800* :  Our correspondent in Sydney Phil Mercer, a British mining company is facing allegations
*22:34.800- 22:38.660* :  of damaging both the environment and local communities in Brazil.
*22:38.660- 22:44.780* :  The company Brazil Iron describes itself as a sustainable mining company and says it can be a
*22:44.780- 22:50.240* :  world leader in making the steel industry greener, but dozens of local residents launching a legal
*22:50.240- 22:55.720* :  claim in a British court today accusing the firm of damaging their health, crops and water supplies.
*22:56.420- 23:00.220* :  Our South America correspondent Ioni Wells has been to the site in Brazil.
*23:02.340- 23:08.200* :  I'm looking at the mine now, it's a huge hunk of grey amid a big sea of green in these mountains.
*23:09.320- 23:15.900* :  Brazil Iron claim that it's uniquely placed here in Bahia to produce a certain type of iron pellet
*23:15.900- 23:20.480* :  which in turn can be used to make steel in a greener way that produces less carbon.
*23:20.480- 23:24.100* :  Now we all need steel, it's in our homes, our cars, our trains.
*23:24.100- 23:28.240* :  So there's reasons to try and make it more carbon friendly, but the big question here
*23:28.640- 23:31.580* :  is whether that's coming at the cost of the environment on the ground.
*23:36.820- 23:43.240* :  How urgently, who is asking you, is the spring from which clear waters have always flowed.
*23:45.500- 23:48.680* :  This is a poem written by Catarina, she's a member of the
*23:48.680- 23:52.820* :  Kilombola community here in Bahia. Descendants of African slaves in Brazil,
*23:52.820- 23:55.820* :  whose land and way of life is protected under Brazilian law.
*23:56.360- 24:01.040* :  They live a few hundred meters below an iron ore mine, where the British owned company Brazil Iron
*24:01.040- 24:03.620* :  was mining and now wants a license to continue.
*24:08.120- 24:12.500* :  We're walking through the riverbank now, which is completely dry.
*24:13.000- 24:17.720* :  This river would have supplied the community with water, but also would have supplied her
*24:17.920- 24:19.880* :  business her lake with water too.
*24:22.480- 24:27.120* :  This was a lake three meters deep, where we had a project to raise fish.
*24:27.120- 24:32.740* :  After the mine started strafting there, waste came down, it fell into the spring,
*24:33.340- 24:35.780* :  with that ebberid to disobey entirely.
*24:36.440- 24:42.160* :  Three more meters of suit and ore is lit, and our project went down the drain.
*24:43.220- 24:47.600* :  It's hard to believe that what I'm looking at now was once a lake that was meet as deep,
*24:47.620- 24:53.300* :  because now it is totally dry, but it is completely overgrown with vegetation.
*24:53.940- 25:00.160* :  We're now at the house of Egemoni, who is a member of the Kilombola
*25:00.160- 25:04.080* :  Bokina community who live in the valley below where the mine is.
*25:04.380- 25:06.500* :  My sister has spirit taught in it.
*25:06.500- 25:08.700* :  It was a respiratory issue with my daughter.
*25:09.000- 25:12.280* :  She practically didn't sleep the whole night trying to scratch her throat.
*25:12.740- 25:15.840* :  I had to take her to the doctor who gave her an inhaler.
*25:17.540- 25:20.180* :  Not everybody here in the community is against the mine, though.
*25:20.180- 25:23.280* :  Some feel that it's brought opportunities and jobs to the area.
*25:26.960- 25:29.700* :  This is Erevelton, he works for Brazil Ion.
*25:32.040- 25:33.780* :  I joined at the company in 2019.
*25:33.780- 25:36.700* :  I had the opportunity to learn on heavy vehicles.
*25:37.440- 25:39.780* :  Then I asked it for the opportunity to learn machines.
*25:40.700- 25:45.800* :  I think one of the main benefits that the company brought was the opportunity to live close to family.
*25:46.460- 25:48.140* :  It is something that money can't buy.
*25:51.440- 25:56.000* :  The company is based far from here, in London and funded by shareholders around the world.
*25:56.020- 26:00.340* :  It says the allegations that faces are untrue and could hurt the local economy,
*26:00.340- 26:04.760* :  but its environmental manager, Rafael Genou, says its doors are open.
*26:11.020- 26:15.700* :  We have to check those water sources that have been dried up.
*26:16.080- 26:17.420* :  It is an important point.
*26:17.720- 26:21.060* :  There is an open communication channel with these communities that includes
*26:21.060- 26:21.940* :  and own Bozman.
*26:22.380- 26:24.540* :  The company always has its ears open.
*26:28.780- 26:30.420* :  The community here is divided.
*26:30.420- 26:33.900* :  But this legal action centers around some members of the community,
*26:33.900- 26:36.520* :  like local geographical, Algeria, and Mccoujee,
*26:36.920- 26:41.060* :  arguing those with a greener way of life shouldn't have to change to provide solutions
*26:41.060- 26:43.200* :  for carbon emissions caused elsewhere.
*26:46.140- 26:47.280* :  There are two realities.
*26:47.760- 26:50.960* :  Do we need to sacrifice everyone in rural areas for the city,
*26:51.380- 26:54.820* :  where people have a 600 year old way of life?
*26:55.000- 26:57.320* :  I believe the communities here should be respected.
*26:57.900- 27:01.040* :  If we're seeing this model is sustainable, that will generate clean energy.
*27:01.820- 27:03.020* :  Is it clean to kill a river?
*27:05.260- 27:08.700* :  Regenery Mccoujee, adding that report from Ioni Wells in Brazil.
*27:09.760- 27:12.580* :  Mass protests against budget cuts to higher education
*27:12.580- 27:16.240* :  have swept the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, and other cities.
*27:16.240- 27:19.820* :  With students and professors saying funding for this year has, in effect,
*27:19.820- 27:24.200* :  been reduced by some 80 percent because of the country's spiraling inflation.
*27:24.360- 27:28.100* :  Brunila Plaza is a student who went to choose day's demonstration.
*27:28.500- 27:31.220* :  My colleague, James Coppano, asked him to describe the scene.
*27:31.920- 27:36.800* :  Well, you would have seen a sea of students, professors, teachers,
*27:37.540- 27:40.860* :  professionals, families, and people who were there defending
*27:40.860- 27:44.200* :  a ride to an education, to higher education.
*27:44.920- 27:50.880* :  In Argentina, education has been public and free of access for everyone
*27:51.500- 27:53.060* :  since the mid 20th century.
*27:53.540- 27:55.840* :  And that's a ride that we give for given.
*27:55.840- 28:01.320* :  And it is not something that we're willing to lose.
*28:01.860- 28:03.400* :  So that's what you would have seen.
*28:03.580- 28:06.180* :  It was a very moving situation.
*28:07.060- 28:13.460* :  Hundreds of thousands of people just protesting for one of the most valued human rights here.
*28:14.820- 28:16.200* :  And is that why you went?
*28:16.200- 28:20.760* :  Because you are very concerned about your future, the future of the universities.
*28:21.560- 28:22.080* :  I'm a student.
*28:22.080- 28:24.180* :  I'm a student of the University of Buenos Aires.
*28:25.040- 28:28.020* :  Not only am I concerned for the future of universities,
*28:28.020- 28:32.460* :  which I'm most certainly worried about,
*28:32.960- 28:37.460* :  we do not know at this moment if we're going to be able to finish this semester.
*28:38.440- 28:40.660* :  But I'm also worried about the future of my country.
*28:41.180- 28:45.120* :  You know, education is fundamental for any
*28:46.120- 28:48.140* :  plans of progress for a country.
*28:48.140- 28:52.540* :  And the whole system of science is also fundamental.
*28:52.540- 28:54.340* :  And it is also being defended.
*28:55.000- 28:57.380* :  So that is why I was there.
*28:57.380- 29:00.100* :  Because I believe that Argentina can progress.
*29:00.100- 29:02.500* :  That we can be a better country,
*29:03.120- 29:03.940* :  a more wealthy one,
*29:04.200- 29:06.620* :  and that requires education for everyone.
*29:06.920- 29:08.840* :  The New Hish President, have you made a,
*29:09.260- 29:12.880* :  has quite often suggested that these state-run universities are
*29:13.540- 29:15.880* :  centers of socialist indoctrination,
*29:15.880- 29:18.480* :  that in some ways the cuts are justified,
*29:18.480- 29:23.280* :  because so many of the universities have different viewpoints to him.
*29:23.660- 29:25.600* :  I mean, I think data speaks for itself.
*29:27.160- 29:30.240* :  More than half of his cabinet comes from public universities.
*29:30.880- 29:36.580* :  So, yeah, I would be at least puzzled by these statements.
*29:37.440- 29:41.280* :  There's definitely a diversity of thought within public universities.
*29:41.900- 29:47.500* :  He came to office on the promise of making big cuts,
*29:48.300- 29:51.120* :  to almost all areas of the national budget, really.
*29:52.100- 29:54.580* :  Why should universities escape from that?
*29:54.900- 29:56.500* :  Education is the base for progress.
*29:56.500- 29:59.600* :  It is the base for a wealthy economy.
*29:59.600- 30:02.900* :  It is the base that you need for an economy
*30:02.900- 30:06.000* :  to industrialize and for economies to grow.
*30:06.220- 30:06.360* :  Right?
*30:07.000- 30:13.480* :  There's no future for Argentina if we cut spending on university,
*30:13.480- 30:18.240* :  on the people who are most likely to contribute the most to the economy.
*30:18.820- 30:21.520* :  It is not one of the most expensive things
*30:22.020- 30:23.840* :  that we have.
*30:23.840- 30:28.760* :  And it is definitely one of the most rewarding things for the economy.
*30:29.460- 30:33.440* :  So, if we just focus on the economy, that is odd,
*30:34.740- 30:38.300* :  but there's also the value that it gets to two sides, you right?
*30:39.020- 30:41.260* :  Bruno La Plata with my colleague James Cotnell.
*30:41.800- 30:44.440* :  Plato, known as the father of Western philosophy,
*30:44.440- 30:47.300* :  died around the year 348 BC.
*30:47.900- 30:50.800* :  Unusually, for an ancient thinker, nearly all of his works
*30:50.800- 30:53.820* :  have survived the exact location of his burial
*30:54.280- 30:56.220* :  has always been a mystery until now,
*30:56.220- 30:59.420* :  where the help of artificial intelligence Italian researchers
*30:59.420- 31:02.860* :  came to have found the long-lost grave of the Greek philosopher.
*31:03.340- 31:04.500* :  Rebecca Wood has the story.
*31:05.280- 31:07.920* :  Wise men talk because they have something to say,
*31:08.560- 31:10.780* :  fools because they have to say something.
*31:11.420- 31:12.700* :  That's one of Plato's quotes,
*31:13.200- 31:14.820* :  and when I'm hoping on this occasion,
*31:15.120- 31:16.420* :  the first part can apply.
*31:17.260- 31:19.540* :  Arguably the greatest of all the Greek philosophers,
*31:20.020- 31:23.000* :  Plato's works form the foundations of Western society.
*31:23.800- 31:25.700* :  He was born a noble man in ancient Greece,
*31:25.700- 31:29.420* :  but rejected his social privilege to devote his life to philosophy.
*31:30.120- 31:33.680* :  He wrote about love and government, ethics, friendship, law,
*31:34.180- 31:38.400* :  and his writing set out the terms of much of what we call Western philosophy today.
*31:39.420- 31:42.360* :  But, as with many illustrious figures of the ancient world,
*31:42.760- 31:45.440* :  his burial place has been a subject of speculation.
*31:46.560- 31:48.380* :  We know that he was buried at the academy,
*31:48.380- 31:51.560* :  a famous school founded by the philosopher in Athens,
*31:52.280- 31:55.600* :  but the grounds are large and exactly where was a mystery.
*31:56.400- 31:58.780* :  Here's where some child papyrus comes in.
*31:59.080- 32:00.740* :  The Herculaneum scrolls.
*32:01.080- 32:05.340* :  They survived the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Italy in 79 AD.
*32:06.220- 32:07.420* :  In their burnt state, though,
*32:07.700- 32:12.620* :  the 2000 year old documents would crumble if anyone attempted to unroll them.
*32:13.280- 32:17.140* :  But, using computer technology and advanced artificial intelligence,
*32:17.140- 32:20.280* :  researchers have been able to take a closer look.
*32:20.860- 32:25.840* :  And it's this research by Graziano Ranochia from the University of Pisa and his team
*32:25.840- 32:28.800* :  that has pinpointed an exact location,
*32:29.340- 32:33.820* :  a private garden in the academy near to a sacred shrine to the Muses.
*32:34.380- 32:38.660* :  The team believe they'll have the whole of the papyrus analyzed by 2026,
*32:39.320- 32:42.580* :  so perhaps I should leave them with some apt words from the man himself.
*32:43.480- 32:46.560* :  No one should be discouraged who can make constant progress,
*32:47.220- 32:48.760* :  even though it'd be slow.
*32:49.460- 32:52.700* :  Rebecca Wood reporting from Plato to Taylor Swift,
*32:52.700- 32:55.540* :  whose fans have been flooding to a pub in London,
*32:55.920- 32:59.020* :  after it was name checked in one of the songs on her new album.
*32:59.460- 33:03.320* :  Staff at the Black Dog in Vauxhall think their pub is referred to in the song
*33:03.320- 33:04.500* :  called The Black Dog.
*33:04.980- 33:08.640* :  It was supposedly frequented by the singer when she lived in the British capital.
*33:09.160- 33:13.580* :  And now as Dan Simpson reports, it seems many Swifties are keen to follow in her footsteps.
*33:16.740- 33:23.040* :  And to somewhere called The Black Dog appears new holes in my heart.
*33:23.140- 33:25.960* :  Mel, so I've stopped you because I saw you take a phone out,
*33:26.480- 33:28.020* :  you're getting a picture of The Black Dog.
*33:28.020- 33:29.420* :  Why is this so important to you?
*33:29.700- 33:30.620* :  Because I love Taylor Swift.
*33:31.600- 33:34.860* :  So when you heard the song, what went through your mind,
*33:34.860- 33:36.140* :  immediately ran down here?
*33:36.980- 33:38.880* :  No, we're actually in London from Canada,
*33:38.880- 33:41.240* :  so we've traveled a long way and thought all this way.
*33:41.240- 33:42.720* :  You've got to walk past the Black Dog.
*33:43.080- 33:44.460* :  What does that music mean to you?
*33:44.580- 33:46.840* :  We've come all this way, so we can go to Lisbon and see her next month.
*33:47.640- 33:48.240* :  So you're on route?
*33:48.240- 33:49.940* :  We are on route to the nearest tour.
*33:50.360- 33:52.260* :  So this is a perfect stopper for you?
*33:52.480- 33:53.460* :  It is indeed, yeah.
*33:55.020- 33:56.820* :  Lily, you work here at The Black Dog.
*33:56.820- 33:59.160* :  Tell us about the last few days.
*33:59.680- 34:02.960* :  It's been crazy to be honest with you, but super, super positive.
*34:02.960- 34:05.120* :  And we've loved having all of the Swifties down.
*34:05.120- 34:08.520* :  We've definitely seen an increase of people coming in.
*34:08.820- 34:10.460* :  You know, the Taylor Swifties effect is real.
*34:10.980- 34:12.680* :  And it's been positive vibes though.
*34:12.680- 34:16.000* :  If we've had to sing along, we've got a couple of new menu items
*34:16.000- 34:17.800* :  dedicated to Taylor going on.
*34:17.800- 34:19.000* :  So yeah, we're just loving it.
*34:19.400- 34:20.960* :  And then you need to work really quickly, right?
*34:20.960- 34:22.900* :  Do you have a Defcon for meeting?
*34:22.900- 34:23.840* :  What can we do?
*34:23.940- 34:25.360* :  Thousands of fans will be here?
*34:25.640- 34:27.440* :  Yeah, we're a small company.
*34:27.440- 34:30.540* :  So thankfully, we can act really quickly on stuff like this.
*34:30.940- 34:34.040* :  So it was just a matter of getting the social media set up properly.
*34:34.040- 34:37.820* :  You know, we launched a TikTok that now has nearly two million views,
*34:37.820- 34:40.200* :  a cumulative over about four or five videos.
*34:40.720- 34:42.320* :  We've tripled our Instagram following.
*34:42.320- 34:44.700* :  We've got merch dropping as well, which is really exciting.
*34:44.700- 34:49.180* :  The Swifties has excited for so definitely working around the clock
*34:49.180- 34:51.320* :  for the next couple of days, I think, but we're loving it.
*34:51.560- 34:54.480* :  Well, she named Check the Track because it seems like she's been here.
*34:54.480- 34:55.460* :  Do you remember any of this?
*34:55.640- 34:57.800* :  Yeah, I couldn't possibly confirm with tonight,
*34:58.340- 34:59.760* :  but we do have a certain blonde regular.
*35:00.140- 35:01.220* :  What do you do at that point?
*35:01.220- 35:03.340* :  Because she's just such a star.
*35:03.780- 35:05.800* :  It must be a big deal for you, but you want to kind of treat them
*35:05.960- 35:07.020* :  like their normal people.
*35:07.020- 35:10.400* :  100% everybody who walks into the pub is just a patron.
*35:10.400- 35:14.200* :  We just want to serve them a good pint and, you know, a really good pub meal.
*35:14.660- 35:17.260* :  And we're so thankful that this is facilitated.
*35:23.880- 35:26.280* :  Dan Simpson reporting from the Black Dog in London.
*35:27.920- 35:28.940* :  And that's all from us for now.
