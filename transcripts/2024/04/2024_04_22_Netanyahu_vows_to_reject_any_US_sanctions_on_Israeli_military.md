*01:18.860- 01:22.020* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.300- 01:29.380* :  I'm Paul Moss and in the early hours of Monday, the 22nd of April, these are our main stories.
*01:29.380- 01:34.600* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Israel's military forces
*01:35.100- 01:41.480* :  will soon step up their attacks on Hamas. Ukraine's President Zelensky says the new US package of
*01:41.480- 01:46.400* :  military aid could bring victory over Russia, but delivery must be rapid.
*01:47.020- 01:52.120* :  And a pro-China party has won a landslide victory in the Maldives parliamentary election.
*01:54.700- 01:55.800* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:56.200- 01:59.160* :  I trust the one can say it without fear of being cavalier.
*01:59.320- 02:01.760* :  These concerts simply wouldn't be the same without this rebel here.
*02:01.840- 02:02.660* :  And yes, it is.
*02:02.940- 02:08.380* :  We look back at the life of Andrew Davis, the accomplished and entertaining classical music conductor.
*02:12.480- 02:17.740* :  Is there a new divide opening up between Israel and Joe Biden's administration in Washington?
*02:18.280- 02:23.120* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israel will soon step up its attacks
*02:23.120- 02:28.480* :  on Hamas. Speaking on the eve of the Passover Jewish holiday, he said further,
*02:28.480- 02:33.780* :  painful blows against Hamas were needed to secure the release of hostages being held in Gaza.
*02:34.540- 02:37.540* :  That is unlikely to go down well with President Biden,
*02:37.860- 02:42.140* :  who's continued to urge caution against using excessive force in Gaza.
*02:42.840- 02:47.600* :  And now there are reports that the administration wants to play sanctions on a unit of the Israeli
*02:47.600- 02:53.500* :  military. The Netsa Yehuda Battalion is accused of being at the center of several incidents of
*02:53.500- 03:00.160* :  violence against Palestinian civilians, including the death of an elderly Palestinian American Omar Asad.
*03:00.160- 03:05.180* :  The Israeli Prime Minister called the reported sanctions the height of absurdity.
*03:08.400- 03:11.520* :  I will fiercely defend the IDF, our army and our fighters.
*03:12.520- 03:18.080* :  If anyone thinks they can impose sanctions on a unit at the IDF, I will fight it with all my strength.
*03:18.840- 03:23.520* :  As our soldiers are united to protect us on the battlefield, we are united to protect
*03:23.520- 03:29.480* :  them on the political field. Together we'll fight, and with God's help, together we'll win.
*03:30.220- 03:31.520* :  Yakhad Nenatach.
*03:32.040- 03:36.800* :  So what might the U.S. measures consist of? A diplomatic correspondent, James Landel,
*03:36.800- 03:38.140* :  explained to me from Jerusalem.
*03:38.820- 03:42.600* :  What we're talking about here is not sanctions in the sort of traditional sense of sort of
*03:42.600- 03:45.540* :  stopping people buying and selling things or traveling or anything like that.
*03:46.040- 03:51.420* :  It is a very specific thing where the United States has this rule. It's called Lehi's law
*03:51.420- 03:56.600* :  after the senator that came up with it. The basically says the U.S. cannot give military aid
*03:57.300- 04:00.220* :  if there is evidence that the people who are getting the military aid
*04:00.580- 04:06.140* :  are or have been committing human rights violations. The State Department for some time has
*04:06.140- 04:13.580* :  been making an assessment about whether or not a particular battalion in the Israeli army had
*04:13.580- 04:18.880* :  breached some of those rules and had committed rights violations. And last Friday,
*04:18.880- 04:24.620* :  Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State, said at a press conference that he had been considering
*04:24.620- 04:28.460* :  this issue for some time, and he said you should expect the results very soon.
*04:28.460- 04:32.660* :  You know, I have made determinations. He said this, you know, without actually naming the
*04:32.660- 04:38.180* :  precise name of the particular battalion involved, but that set various hairs running and has
*04:38.180- 04:44.020* :  caused a pretty fierce backlash in Israel. Do we have any idea why the United States might do
*04:44.020- 04:50.300* :  this at this time? I mean, Derek, I say it is internal politics within the U.S. in play here.
*04:50.580- 04:53.940* :  This is actually something that's been going on for quite a long time. It's a long process.
*04:53.940- 05:00.740* :  Most of the allegations that are being looked at occurred long before the October attack by Hamas.
*05:00.840- 05:05.420* :  So this is a long term thing. And I think it's just one of those things. It's just sort of coming out
*05:05.420- 05:10.560* :  now. There is a sort of diplomatic issues, you know, you don't want to be having a dispute with
*05:10.560- 05:15.320* :  your key ally in the middle of a war, but equally at the same time within the State Department,
*05:15.320- 05:20.380* :  there are people and officials there who believe that actually now is the best time to do it,
*05:20.800- 05:26.200* :  because it demonstrates the U.S. still follows rules. And you got to remember that this is coming
*05:26.200- 05:32.740* :  on almost the same 24 hours when the United States House of Representatives has authorized $13
*05:32.740- 05:38.580* :  billion of fresh military aid to Israel. We've spoken about the strains in the relationship
*05:38.580- 05:44.920* :  between Benjamin Netanyahu and Joe Biden personally. This presumably is not going to improve matters.
*05:45.260- 05:51.680* :  No, it won't. I mean, Mr. Netanyahu has issued a very, very clear note of objection to this.
*05:52.020- 05:56.440* :  Benny Gantz, another member of the war cabinet, has put out a statement saying that he's spoken
*05:56.440- 06:03.120* :  to Mr. Blinken personally about it and is urging him to reconsider. So the Israeli leadership
*06:03.120- 06:09.260* :  are really pushing back hard on this one. James Landale. So we're in the finishing stretch.
*06:09.260- 06:15.040* :  The U.S. House of Representatives has voted in favor of a new military aid package for Ukraine.
*06:15.820- 06:20.300* :  Now it's up to the Senate and then President Biden to approve the legislation probably in the next
*06:20.300- 06:26.460* :  few days. But for people in Ukraine, all this dithering in Washington is not some abstract issue
*06:26.460- 06:31.380* :  of political machination. While they've been waiting, they've seen Russian missiles and drones
*06:31.380- 06:36.960* :  raining down destruction without the kit they need to fend these off. And Russian land forces
*06:36.960- 06:42.060* :  have also exploited their vulnerability. Russia, on Sunday, claimed to have captured a front-line
*06:42.060- 06:47.800* :  village, Bogdanovka, close to the strategically important town of Chaziviar. Against this
*06:47.800- 06:52.960* :  background, Ukraine's President Zelensky welcomed the aid package, but stressed the importance of
*06:52.960- 06:58.900* :  rapid delivery and the need for long-range weapons. Here's our Ukraine correspondent, James Waterhouse.
*06:59.820- 07:04.720* :  After six months of a costly wait for Ukraine, the news finally came from Washington.
*07:05.160- 07:09.520* :  On this vote, the Asia 311 and the Asia 112 of the bill has passed.
*07:12.640- 07:19.560* :  President Zelensky welcomed the decision. I think this support will really strengthen the
*07:19.560- 07:30.820* :  armed forces of Ukraine. And we will have a chance for victory if Ukraine really gets the weapons
*07:31.020- 07:37.560* :  system. The long-range artillery, because we need long-range weapons to not lose people
*07:37.560- 07:42.760* :  on the front line and air defense. This is crucial.
*07:46.060- 07:51.380* :  For many Sunday means a service at St. Michael's Cathedral, and under the golden domes,
*07:51.720- 07:55.580* :  everyone seems to be aware of how significant this news is from Washington.
*07:55.760- 08:03.520* :  I'm very grateful to the Americans, says Ihor, that even during this difficult time before
*08:03.520- 08:08.680* :  the elections, they were able to come to an agreement. On a morning this miserable,
*08:09.260- 08:13.580* :  the warmth of the underground metro will always trump the wet streets above.
*08:14.200- 08:23.500* :  Actually, it's quite late, but it's better late than never, and I hope it will kind of help
*08:23.540- 08:30.220* :  Ukraine withstand. So I'm really happy about it. Of course, I'm a bit disappointed.
*08:30.760- 08:34.760* :  Did it took so long? But anyways, it's better late than never.
*08:40.600- 08:46.880* :  How else can Ukraine survive without this? It cannot. Only the aid from the US and European
*08:46.880- 08:54.320* :  countries can save us. It's been so many deaths. It's impossible. We really want help
*08:54.860- 08:57.780* :  for our children to survive. So we're waiting.
*09:03.200- 09:08.940* :  Mikola Bieskov is a military analyst. We need to applaud current package, but we need to think
*09:08.940- 09:16.120* :  about hypothetical eventualities as a next package. Afraid in the US might not be able to pass
*09:16.760- 09:22.880* :  through. That's why it's up to European states, for UK, for continental Europe to increase production
*09:23.900- 09:32.520* :  and be able to meet Ukrainian requirements and the contingencies that US is not able to do it,
*09:32.520- 09:38.000* :  because we see that more and more Republicans, unfortunately, are skeptical towards aid for Ukraine.
*09:38.000- 09:43.400* :  What the unlocking of this bill has shown is that democracy takes time. You can be sure that
*09:43.400- 09:47.840* :  in the Putin of Russia doesn't have as many political hurdles when it comes to military spending.
*09:47.840- 09:53.320* :  For President Zelensky, the challenge now is keeping the politics away from the fighting,
*09:53.320- 09:56.720* :  as he'll be under pressure to make this American package count.
*09:57.180- 10:02.880* :  James Wardhouse in Ukraine. Russia hasn't minced its words in responding to America's promise of
*10:02.880- 10:08.820* :  more aid for Ukraine. Indeed, it is sought to touch on what is perhaps a national raw nerve in the US,
*10:08.820- 10:14.260* :  in a post on social media. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharová said the US would end up being
*10:14.260- 10:21.520* :  humiliated in Ukraine just as it had been in Vietnam and Afghanistan. In any case, she added the
*10:21.520- 10:26.620* :  extra military aid would only lead to more Ukrainians dying. Here's Nikki Cardwell.
*10:27.140- 10:32.660* :  Strong words from Maria Zakharová on the social media channel Telegram after the news broke that
*10:32.660- 10:37.780* :  Congress had following months of stalemate agreed to send billions in aid to Ukraine.
*10:37.780- 10:43.700* :  She dismissed the deal as direct support of terrorist activities and evidence that the US
*10:43.700- 10:49.520* :  wanted Ukraine to fight to the last Ukrainian. And she widened her criticism, saying the American
*10:49.520- 10:56.280* :  bill, which also contained support for Taiwan and Israel would exacerbate regional security crises
*10:56.280- 11:02.140* :  around the world. Russian state television has focused on opposition in the Republican party to
*11:02.140- 11:08.560* :  the aid package, translating clips of lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene, angrily accusing the speaker
*11:08.560- 11:14.740* :  of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, of betraying US interests for his decision to help
*11:14.740- 11:20.800* :  the bill pass. Others focused on comments made by the American entrepreneur, one of the men behind
*11:20.800- 11:27.940* :  PayPal, David Sachs. On ex, formerly known as Twitter, he said that it would not make any difference
*11:27.940- 11:34.960* :  and Ukraine would fail anyway. Online, many pro-war bloggers have stuck to the familiar narrative
*11:34.960- 11:41.520* :  that the US is only doing this to weaken Russia, with one saying it's a warning for Moscow to
*11:41.520- 11:48.180* :  beef up its military preparedness ahead of a new phase of the war. Nikki Cardwell, while Russia
*11:48.180- 11:53.620* :  continues to press on with its invasion of Ukraine, it's also seeking to extend its influence
*11:53.620- 11:59.540* :  elsewhere, including in West Africa. There have been a series of military coups in the region,
*11:59.540- 12:03.960* :  with regimes coming to power that seem to be leading more towards Moscow than the West.
*12:04.720- 12:10.020* :  Niger is one of those countries, and Sunday saw a protest in the northern town of Agadez,
*12:10.100- 12:13.180* :  with people demanding that American troops depart.
*12:21.040- 12:25.960* :  American troops have been in Niger as elsewhere in West Africa, at least in part to fight
*12:25.960- 12:30.040* :  Islamist militants. But France has had troops there even longer. Indeed,
*12:30.040- 12:36.420* :  Niger was a French colony until 1916, so why have coup leaders there turned against them now?
*12:36.920- 12:40.240* :  The question I posed to our Africa regional editor, Will Ross.
*12:41.040- 12:49.120* :  What Niger has done since the coup last July is look at how it can take advantage of
*12:49.760- 12:56.440* :  what there was this growing anti-French sentiment, kind of used that to push out the French,
*12:56.480- 13:03.480* :  who they've kind of for a long time seen as still using their colonial influence in an unfair way.
*13:03.480- 13:09.680* :  The America situation is slightly different, because I don't think Niger has a huge problem
*13:10.180- 13:14.180* :  with America. I think the Americans are pretty reluctant to stay on in the country
*13:15.000- 13:20.620* :  if there's a significant Russian presence. There have been these demonstrations in Agadez in
*13:20.620- 13:26.820* :  particular, calling for the Americans to leave, but bearing in mind the investment that the
*13:26.820- 13:33.040* :  Americans have put in, including this drone base costing $100 million, it was a big hub for
*13:33.820- 13:38.120* :  effort to tackle Islamist militants. So this is quite a big blow for the Americans.
*13:38.300- 13:43.640* :  What is the effect going to be across the region? Because it's not just in Niger that we've
*13:43.640- 13:48.200* :  seen this turn against the West, is it? That's right. Well, this is the big unknown really. So,
*13:48.460- 13:54.420* :  Mali and Bikina Faso, we've had a similar pattern where there have been military coups and then
*13:54.460- 14:01.800* :  pivot towards Moscow. What we don't know, of course, is how the Russian influence is going to change
*14:01.800- 14:07.520* :  if it will, the whole fight against the Islamist militants. The authorities in Niger and to a certain
*14:07.520- 14:13.320* :  extent, people on the ground say, look, we've had all this foreign intervention and it hasn't managed
*14:13.320- 14:19.160* :  to stop any of the attacks. So, let's try Russia. But the unknown is what would have happened,
*14:19.160- 14:25.220* :  if the French hadn't been there and the UN force hadn't been in Mali and the Americans hadn't
*14:25.220- 14:31.080* :  been in Niger and elsewhere. We don't know how much worse it could have been, or whether the
*14:31.080- 14:38.160* :  presence of these Western military forces is kind of provocation to the Islamist militants and it
*14:38.160- 14:44.440* :  kind of spurs them on. Will Ross, and as we record this podcast, the Nigerian army says that six
*14:44.440- 14:49.400* :  of its soldiers had been killed by militants in Niger. It said two officers were among those killed
*14:49.400- 14:54.980* :  during an ambush by what it called terrorists. An army statement said a number of the attackers had
*14:55.340- 15:00.520* :  been killed, that others were still being pursued. Now, there was another battle over Chinese
*15:00.520- 15:05.680* :  influence on Sunday in the Indian Ocean Nation of the Maldives. Parliamentary elections there
*15:05.680- 15:10.720* :  seemed to have resulted in victory for the pro-Chinese party, the People's National Congress.
*15:10.720- 15:17.740* :  Lippica Pellam reports. With its pristine white beaches and luxury resorts, the Maldives is known
*15:17.740- 15:23.620* :  to the world as a top-holiday destination. But in recent years, it has become a geopolitical hotspot
*15:23.620- 15:29.880* :  as the Indian Ocean Island Nation continues its shift towards China and away from long-standing
*15:29.880- 15:36.200* :  ties with India. Sunday's vote was seen as a crucial test for Mr. Muizu's plan to press
*15:36.200- 15:42.500* :  ahead with closer cooperation with Beijing. Lippica Pellam. Millions of people in southern China
*15:42.500- 15:47.360* :  are on alert, following widespread flooding, forecasters say that heavy rain will continue,
*15:47.960- 15:53.300* :  making conditions worse in the days ahead. East Asia Regional Editor Mickey Brister has the
*15:53.300- 15:58.260* :  details. One river in Guangdong province could rise to levels seen only once in a century,
*15:58.860- 16:04.020* :  speaking at nearly six metres above the warning level. Elsewhere, people are thought to be trapped,
*16:04.020- 16:08.660* :  following a series of landslides, although no deaths have so far been reported.
*16:09.460- 16:14.440* :  Chansport, along rivers, roads and rail, has been disrupted, and hundreds of schools will be
*16:14.440- 16:20.780* :  closed on Monday. People have already had to be rescued from flooded homes. Chinese forecasters
*16:20.780- 16:26.260* :  said the rain is expected to continue until at least Tuesday. Mickey Bristow
*16:27.120- 16:31.920* :  Members of Japan's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community have been celebrating,
*16:31.920- 16:37.980* :  with Tokyo holding its annual pride march. But the music, dancing and general festivities
*16:37.980- 16:43.760* :  come amid disappointment. Recent legislation in Japan has liberalised various laws around marriage,
*16:44.400- 16:50.480* :  and yet there are no plans to allow same-sex marriage, making Japan the only country in the G7
*16:50.480- 17:00.280* :  group of nations to forbid this. Elebignal reports. A parade of rainbow flags eye-catching
*17:00.280- 17:06.060* :  costumes and elaborately decorated floats only add to the vibrancy of Tokyo's cherry-blossomed
*17:06.060- 17:11.440* :  line streets. The city's rainbow pride held in late April is one of the largest LGBTQ
*17:11.440- 17:17.980* :  festivals in Asia, and although its first and foremost a celebration, it's also an opportunity
*17:18.060- 17:25.480* :  for activism. I'm a lesbian. I live with my partner, who's a woman, and I'll toy rope on.
*17:25.820- 17:29.860* :  There are various everyday worries and obstacles when you live as a non-standard family.
*17:30.140- 17:37.940* :  So I'm taking part today to make us more visible. Public opinion in Japan tends to be positive when
*17:37.940- 17:44.120* :  it comes to LGBTQ rights, but there are few laws that defend them. In fact, it wasn't till last
*17:44.120- 17:49.860* :  year that the Japanese parliament passed its first ever law on sexual orientation and gender identity,
*17:49.860- 17:56.880* :  promoting understanding and avoiding unfair discrimination. As such, it remains the only country
*17:56.880- 18:04.120* :  in the G7 that does not legally recognise same-sex unions in any form. Rico Nakata is taking part
*18:04.120- 18:11.720* :  in today's march. She says it's long overdue. Well, we're all the same. We only live one life.
*18:11.720- 18:17.000* :  We all want to live happily together with the person we love. So I think it would be good if
*18:17.000- 18:24.080* :  everyone could get married and become a family. And she's not alone in calling for the
*18:24.080- 18:30.240* :  Japanese government to do more. Last month, ambassadors to Japan from six other G7 countries wrote a
*18:30.240- 18:36.980* :  joint letter to the Prime Minister Fimio Koshida, urging him to enact legal protections for LGBTQ people.
*18:37.640- 18:42.240* :  But the Japanese video game company Nintendo has got ahead of the government. Last year,
*18:42.240- 18:47.160* :  it announced its support for same-sex marriage, and said it would recognise employees in same-sex
*18:47.160- 18:50.680* :  partnerships, as identical to opposite sex marriages.
*18:59.040- 19:04.680* :  Still to come. I remember being very young, probably kindergarten, and could tell that the other
*19:04.680- 19:10.780* :  kids seemed to feel things that I just didn't. If you know 20 people, it's likely that one of them
*19:19.560- 19:23.660* :  is a sociopath. Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless
*19:23.660- 19:28.520* :  companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said, yes. And then when I asked
*19:28.520- 19:32.880* :  if raising prices technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said, what the
*19:32.880- 19:38.520* :  are you talking about? You insane Hollywood. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited
*19:38.520- 19:43.960* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month. Give it a try at mintmobile.com slash switch.

*20:28.260- 20:33.660* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast next to Northern Kosovo. There's been a referendum
*20:33.660- 20:38.980* :  there over whether to kick out four local mayors, the four are all ethnic Albanians,
*20:39.480- 20:44.080* :  and we're originally elected only because ethnic Serbs, the majority in the district boycotted
*20:44.080- 20:48.980* :  the contest. Now, the referendum on Sunday gave voters the chance to have the four removed,
*20:49.700- 20:54.900* :  but it seems Serbs once again boycotted the voting. And this isn't just some minor matter of
*20:54.900- 21:01.300* :  local municipal politics. As our Balkans correspondent, Guide Lorny explains, it has wider implications.
*21:02.080- 21:05.960* :  Kosovo's international partners had hoped that the recall of the ethnic Albanian
*21:05.960- 21:11.580* :  mayors would ease tensions and majority Serb North Kosovo, but the vote turned into a farce as
*21:11.580- 21:17.840* :  Kosovo Serbs refused to take part. In one municipality's Vetshan, nobody cast a single vote.
*21:17.840- 21:23.620* :  In total, only a few hundred people submitted ballots from a voter list of almost 50,000.
*21:23.620- 21:28.200* :  The tiny turnout means the mayors will remain in office. Kosovo's authorities
*21:28.200- 21:33.180* :  forcibly installed them last year, triggering violent scenes in several municipalities.
*21:33.840- 21:38.140* :  The mayors had only gained votes from a miniscule proportion of the electorate due to another
*21:38.140- 21:44.300* :  Serb boycott. The US and EU wanted Pristina to remedy what they viewed as an untenable situation,
*21:44.300- 21:49.240* :  but the Kosovo authorities dragged their feet. They finally agreed to the recall vote,
*21:49.240- 21:54.740* :  but Serb parties said it came with unacceptable conditions. They complained it was unreasonable to
*21:54.740- 22:00.300* :  require more than 50% of the electorate to vote for the mayor's removal when a mere 3% had elected
*22:00.300- 22:05.300* :  them. Kosovo's partners must now find another solution to the problem. Guide Lorny,
*22:06.100- 22:11.480* :  The Prime Minister of India has made one key promise to his country. I will bring you economic
*22:12.140- 22:16.500* :  development. That's certainly his promise to voters, with the country just beginning a general
*22:16.500- 22:22.140* :  election, citizens casting their ballots over the course of six weeks. But economic development
*22:22.140- 22:26.200* :  can, of course, bring problems in its wake, environmental problems in particular,
*22:26.200- 22:32.180* :  and particularly when the climate is rapidly changing. Take Bengaluru, the southern city,
*22:32.180- 22:36.960* :  formerly known as Bangalore, is right at the forefront of India's new economy, something
*22:36.960- 22:43.180* :  of a tech hub. As James Kumarisami reports, residents there have been learning about the drawbacks
*22:43.180- 22:50.720* :  of economic growth. We're heading out to the eastern edges of this rapidly expanding city,
*22:51.340- 22:56.540* :  in what appears to be an almost permanent rush hour. All around are signs of construction and
*22:56.540- 23:03.140* :  huge glass-fronted buildings, which belong to tech companies attracted to this Silicon Valley
*23:03.140- 23:08.800* :  of the East. But this rapid expansion, as well as bringing opportunities, has also brought
*23:08.800- 23:13.800* :  huge challenges. At the moment, there are significantly higher temperatures than usual for this
*23:13.800- 23:18.600* :  time of year. We are all sweltering, and there's been no rain at all for four and a half months.
*23:19.200- 23:22.080* :  Bengaluru is suffering from a major water shortage.
*23:23.800- 23:28.080* :  Hi, I'm Zibi. I live in Whitefield, and I'm a community volunteer.
*23:28.720- 23:34.440* :  Zibi is part of a residence group in Whitefield, a Bengaluru suburb that's prospered and modernised
*23:34.440- 23:40.460* :  with the IT boom. But unlike central Bengaluru, which pumps in water from the state's main Kavary
*23:40.460- 23:46.540* :  River, around 100 kilometres away, these residents rely largely on groundwater for their supplies.
*23:47.200- 23:51.660* :  Zibi says the current shortage shows that's not sufficient for the city's flood of
*23:51.660- 23:57.500* :  incomeers. There is a crisis happening in Bangalore, especially in not in the central areas of
*23:57.500- 24:02.800* :  Bangalore, but in the outer areas which are not serviced by a Kavary, with the rains being not so
*24:02.800- 24:09.640* :  great this year. Water bodies of Bangalore, not in an optimum state, and also at the same moment,
*24:09.640- 24:13.860* :  the population has increased to this point that we are having this crisis now.
*24:17.000- 24:22.500* :  San Andreas Amarali is very difficult run. We don't have any sufficient water.
*24:23.160- 24:28.600* :  Chashay Kumar is one of those filling the gaps. His six multi-coloured vehicles make up one of the
*24:28.600- 24:34.260* :  many private fleets of water trucks that rumble through the city's park streets. They usually
*24:34.260- 24:38.220* :  filled from the four wells that he's drilled in a dusty parking lot.
*24:42.660- 24:48.160* :  But as one of his drivers fills a 6,000 litre truck, he tells us that two of his wells have
*24:48.160- 24:54.300* :  run dry, so he's had to hike prices and that's led to accusations that he is part of a water mafia.
*24:56.700- 25:02.160* :  All right, time to get into the water truck. All right, thank you very much.
*25:03.860- 25:08.640* :  We set off on a delivery journey with a cab's eye view of the city. Above us a modern,
*25:08.640- 25:14.400* :  raised metro system on the roads in front of us dozens of water trucks and tractors pulling water
*25:14.400- 25:19.740* :  containers. The fact they're all needed speaks to a wider problem says Sunita Narein, director of
*25:19.740- 25:25.940* :  the Centre for Science and Environment in Delhi. So Bangalore is a classic case. It's a case of every
*25:25.940- 25:33.880* :  Indian city and I would argue with you. It's a case of every city in the world, which has had
*25:34.280- 25:41.600* :  the arrogance of thinking that it can bring water from longer and longer distances. They bring
*25:41.600- 25:47.800* :  their water from Kaveri River, which is a hundred kilometres away, where they have to pump the water
*25:48.200- 25:55.140* :  up. They lose 50% of the water in the transportation. Now this is where Bangalore
*25:55.700- 26:03.120* :  like Cape Town, like Delhi and like I would argue even London needs to rethink, seriously rethink
*26:04.060- 26:09.940* :  water in times of climate change. Sunita Narein ending their report by James Kumaris Army.
*26:10.900- 26:17.080* :  Now, if you know 20 people, it's likely that one of them is a sociopath. That at least is the
*26:17.080- 26:23.260* :  claim of a new book by Patrik Gagni, who diagnosed herself as suffering from the condition. And then
*26:23.260- 26:27.720* :  spent much of her life trying to help others like her. She spoke to my colleague Julian Warica,
*26:28.300- 26:32.160* :  telling him first about the time she realized there was something different about her.
*26:32.740- 26:38.880* :  I remember being very young, probably kindergarten, and could tell that the other kids seemed to feel
*26:38.880- 26:44.920* :  things that I just didn't. I had a sister, so I knew what complex emotional development looked
*26:44.960- 26:51.400* :  like, and I knew that I wasn't on track. As soon as I recognised that, I also recognised that
*26:51.400- 26:57.480* :  saying that I didn't feel remorse, I didn't experience guilt, was not met favourably. And I think
*26:57.480- 27:04.140* :  that really speaks to how this personality type develops. If left unchecked, this tendency to hide,
*27:04.140- 27:10.240* :  manipulate lie about how you feel or don't feel, which starts out as a coping mechanism ultimately
*27:10.240- 27:16.880* :  develops into a life strategy. And as you continued your time at school, how did that behaviour
*27:17.560- 27:25.480* :  play out? I remember feeling a pressure, and I couldn't explain why, but I felt urges to be
*27:25.480- 27:31.420* :  destructive. I remember sitting behind a little girl in school, and she had two brets in her hair,
*27:31.420- 27:38.560* :  and I was feeling particularly pressurised that day, and the impulse was take one of her brets,
*27:38.580- 27:42.980* :  and you'll feel better. As soon as that bret was in my hand, all of the tension that I had been
*27:42.980- 27:47.840* :  experiencing evaporated. So take it forward from there, you get older, no doubt the behaviour
*27:47.840- 27:56.440* :  continues. At what point were you able to identify whatever was going on? I was in a psychology class,
*27:56.520- 28:04.340* :  and I heard the instructor discuss sociopathy, which she described as an emotional or a personality
*28:04.340- 28:10.280* :  disorder that resulted in individuals not being able to access a full range of emotion, and that
*28:10.280- 28:14.860* :  they act out in an attempt to access some emotion. And that's really when it clicked,
*28:14.860- 28:19.380* :  this sounds like this is what's going on with me. Truly the first time I made that connection.
*28:19.840- 28:25.200* :  I remember one day driving home, I had recently discovered that sociopathy is believed to represent
*28:25.200- 28:32.920* :  5% of the population, and I remember feeling a sense of sadness for them, and I thought this
*28:32.920- 28:39.280* :  feels like empathy. If I can empathize with others like me, perhaps I can grow that empathy
*28:39.280- 28:45.760* :  beyond myself to other groups of people, and I started to work at it from that angle.
*28:46.220- 28:51.760* :  And over the years, have you reached out to fellow sociopaths and had those kinds of conversations?
*28:51.760- 28:55.020* :  I have not reached out to them, but they have reached out to me.
*28:55.340- 28:59.480* :  When you say to people, oh, by the way, I'm a sociopath, what do they say?
*29:00.120- 29:05.160* :  They always smile. In terms of the book itself, sociopath, a memoir, I was struck by the word
*29:05.160- 29:11.200* :  memoir, because that to me says it's all sort of behind you, whereas clearly it's not. It's a daily
*29:11.200- 29:16.820* :  thing that you're still dealing with. Sociopathy is a mental disorder. It doesn't really ever go away.
*29:16.820- 29:22.400* :  The ways in which I learn to manage it have certainly evolved, and it's my hope that others
*29:22.400- 29:27.060* :  like me will read this, and perhaps find their own coping mechanisms that are constructive,
*29:27.060- 29:31.520* :  as opposed to destructive. Patrick Gagney talking to Julian Warica.
*29:32.720- 29:37.440* :  Sunday was a record setting day at the London Marathon, a greater number than ever took part,
*29:37.440- 29:44.500* :  more than 50,000 running the 42.1 km course, just over 26 miles through the capital.
*29:45.040- 29:49.320* :  With many fundraising for charity, there were plenty of eye-catching costumes on display.
*29:49.320- 29:54.160* :  One competitor dressed as an aeroplane, others as a camel and a shark.
*29:55.000- 29:59.400* :  But the most important record was set by the Olympic champion, Perez-Chép-Chichir,
*29:59.880- 30:05.500* :  making it the fastest time ever for a woman. Meanwhile, the men's race was won by fellow Kenyon,
*30:05.500- 30:10.940* :  Alexander Mentezo Mugnau, while two Swiss athletes Marcel Hugg and Catherine De Bruyne
*30:10.940- 30:14.060* :  took the wheelchair events. Joe Wilson sent this report.
*30:18.980- 30:24.340* :  The London Marathon is sport's great shared experience, an estimated 50,000 began.
*30:24.720- 30:29.040* :  The elite and the six hour hopefuls were all heading for the same finishing line.
*30:29.780- 30:34.000* :  In the London Marathon, the best women run separately, without male pacemakers.
*30:34.000- 30:39.340* :  It often means there's intense racing. Perez-Chép-Chichir waited until Buckingham Palace
*30:39.340- 30:42.260* :  to make her move and break from her rivals for the line.
*30:42.820- 30:46.160* :  The winning time was two hours 16 minutes 16 seconds.
*30:48.560- 30:52.320* :  To Jeppe Chichir's astonishment, she'd taken nearly a second off the
*30:52.320- 30:54.700* :  previous women's only world record.
*30:55.160- 30:59.240* :  I'm so happy for today, if you try, I was not expecting to run.
*30:59.240- 31:04.300* :  Our record I knew we will make it, we will run, but I was not expecting to be me.
*31:04.580- 31:08.640* :  Kenya's Alexander Mentezo Mugnau was a clear winner in the men's race ahead of the veteran
*31:08.640- 31:14.400* :  Kenanisa Bekele. In third and fourth, two British runners, Emil Keras and Mohamed Mahamed,
*31:14.820- 31:20.200* :  encouraging signs of life after Mofara. In the wheelchair races, there were two dominant Swiss
*31:20.200- 31:26.140* :  victories, Catherine de Brunner and Marcel Hooke. They won before, but this time for the first time,
*31:26.140- 31:32.000* :  they earned the same prize money as the other London winners. That equality may have been
*31:32.000- 31:38.480* :  the marathon's most significant advance. Joe Wilson. Classical music conductors sometimes
*31:38.480- 31:44.040* :  have a reputation for being rather moody, difficult to work with perhaps, but that was never
*31:44.040- 31:48.260* :  said about Andrew Davis, the acclaimed maestro who's just died at the age of 80.
*31:48.260- 31:53.660* :  If Sir Andrew had any particular reputation, it was for having a light hearted approach,
*31:53.660- 31:59.840* :  willing to indulge and indeed amuse both his orchestras and their audiences. Our culture correspondent
*32:07.860- 32:13.680* :  Noan Angie reports. Sir Andrew Davis conducting at the BBC Proms in 2022, one of many times he
*32:13.680- 32:19.760* :  did so over a career that's banned 50 years. The much-loved maestro is one of the longest serving
*32:19.760- 32:25.300* :  chief conductors of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He often brought humour to his performances.
*32:26.220- 32:30.880* :  The last night of the Proms is a joyous and sometimes raucous highlight of the British cultural
*32:30.880- 32:36.620* :  year, and in 1992 he delighted the audience by singing the traditional conductor speech
*32:37.040- 32:41.680* :  to a much-loved Gilbert and Sullivan tune. I trust that one can say it without fear of being
*32:41.680- 32:45.280* :  Cavalier, these concerts simply wouldn't be the same without this rabble here. And yes,
*32:45.280- 32:49.980* :  it would never sound like a prodigal or an festival. This is the very model of a modern music festival.
*32:51.480- 32:55.840* :  Sir Andrew performed a wide range of repertoire ranging from contemporary to Baroque.
*32:56.500- 33:01.280* :  Speaking to the BBC in 1986, he said he enjoyed every single concert.
*33:01.800- 33:04.800* :  It's funny, sometimes one isn't even feeling like, you know, you go to him and you think,
*33:04.800- 33:08.440* :  oh my god, I've got a concert tonight, and then you walk out on stage and there's something really
*33:08.440- 33:13.420* :  magic can happen for no reason. I mean, you may be feeling physically tired, but it's that sort of
*33:14.220- 33:19.540* :  unpredictability of making music, and of course any recreative art is extraordinary because no
*33:19.540- 33:24.700* :  two performances are ever the same. After retiring from the BBC, Sir Andrew moved to Chicago,
*33:24.700- 33:30.220* :  which is where he died from leukemia. Tributes for him have flooded in, including from the director
*33:30.220- 33:36.120* :  of BBC Proms, David Picard. He said Sir Andrew's enthusiasm for music knew no bounds,
*33:36.600- 33:39.000* :  and all his performances were to be cherished.
*33:40.840- 33:44.440* :  Norman Anci on the life of the acclaimed British conductor Sir Andrew Davis,
*33:44.940- 33:46.320* :  who's died at the age of 80.
*33:49.020- 33:53.000* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
