*00:46.200- 00:46.920* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*00:46.920- 00:49.380* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team,
*00:49.380- 00:52.980* :  if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation.
*00:53.400- 00:54.020* :  They said yes.
*00:54.440- 00:56.140* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically
*00:56.140- 00:58.400* :  violates those owners to your contracts,
*00:58.400- 01:00.780* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*01:00.780- 01:02.380* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*01:02.640- 01:05.080* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited
*01:05.080- 01:07.980* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*01:27.520- 01:29.340* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in this edition
*01:29.340- 01:31.640* :  uploaded on Saturday, April the 20th,
*01:31.960- 01:34.820* :  we meet the teenager who's dancing in the rain in Nigeria
*01:34.820- 01:38.460* :  brought viral fame that's inspired a documentary about him.
*01:38.800- 01:39.820* :  It's quite a story.
*01:40.160- 01:42.180* :  I would recommend when you're watching it
*01:42.180- 01:43.340* :  have like a tissue box,
*01:43.340- 01:44.680* :  because you're probably going to cry,
*01:45.140- 01:45.620* :  because I did.
*01:46.880- 01:49.640* :  The 67-year-old thought to be the world's oldest gorilla,
*01:49.640- 01:51.600* :  so what she really like.
*01:51.940- 01:54.880* :  She's a sweet granny, so we fulfilled her wish,
*01:55.060- 01:58.260* :  and now she lives in a great retirement home.
*01:58.720- 02:00.040* :  Also in The Happy Pod.
*02:00.440- 02:02.040* :  I think if you want to imagine them,
*02:02.100- 02:03.360* :  they're tiny meatballs.
*02:03.980- 02:06.800* :  We find out why these so-called tiny meatballs
*02:06.800- 02:09.060* :  are a breakthrough in prenatal medicine.
*02:09.580- 02:11.160* :  And he's really good,
*02:11.160- 02:12.580* :  but if you're going off the trail,
*02:12.580- 02:14.800* :  he just sits and he won't go any further.
*02:15.080- 02:18.040* :  Until you come back and then he'll correct
*02:18.040- 02:19.360* :  where you're supposed to go.
*02:20.000- 02:22.920* :  Find out more about this sure-footed tour guide.
*02:28.920- 02:32.260* :  Now you may remember a video that went viral four years ago
*02:32.580- 02:35.080* :  of a young Nigerian boy dancing in the rain
*02:35.080- 02:37.400* :  and peruiting through muddy puddles.
*02:37.980- 02:39.840* :  After becoming an internet sensation,
*02:40.280- 02:43.820* :  Antony Maddie was offered a place at the prestigious Elmhurst Valley School
*02:44.140- 02:46.040* :  in the city of Birmingham here in Britain.
*02:46.620- 02:48.460* :  Antony, who's now 14 years old,
*02:48.460- 02:51.240* :  is training to become a professional ballet dancer.
*02:51.920- 02:53.080* :  It's an amazing journey,
*02:53.080- 02:57.820* :  and Disney Plus has made a documentary about his life, called Maddie.
*02:58.420- 03:01.080* :  I was five years old and I discovered by me.
*03:02.400- 03:04.360* :  People think that it's not for boys.
*03:05.840- 03:08.520* :  If it's like dream, then I have to follow you.
*03:10.080- 03:12.380* :  Sarah Montague spoke to Antony and asked him
*03:12.580- 03:13.980* :  how he felt about the film.
*03:14.740- 03:16.620* :  It was very, very exciting.
*03:17.200- 03:20.920* :  One of the reason why I agreed to make the film was to be able to inspire kids
*03:20.920- 03:25.420* :  who want to dance or do anything they want to do in life.
*03:25.740- 03:30.540* :  Right, I mean, obviously the nature of film has had a profound effect on your life
*03:30.580- 03:34.740* :  because it was a little viral video that really transformed your life.
*03:35.100- 03:36.100* :  Tell us what happened.
*03:36.720- 03:38.780* :  Yes, it was about four years ago.
*03:39.120- 03:42.820* :  I came into my ballet classes, started practicing
*03:43.160- 03:44.480* :  and then filmed a video.
*03:45.020- 03:47.360* :  It was uploaded on Instagram and then the next day,
*03:47.740- 03:50.700* :  I got told that I went viral, which was surprising.
*03:51.140- 03:55.160* :  We should say this is a video of you dancing ballet in Lagos
*03:55.280- 03:57.040* :  and basically some muddy puddles.
*03:58.560- 03:59.980* :  And as a result, you had offers.
*03:59.980- 04:01.220* :  You had offers from America,
*04:01.820- 04:03.720* :  but then you also had an offer from Birmingham,
*04:03.720- 04:05.400* :  which is where you are now, Elmerst.
*04:05.540- 04:05.860* :  Yes.
*04:06.060- 04:11.360* :  That, the decision to come to the UK and say here, it was quite hard.
*04:11.960- 04:16.120* :  I think what really helped us having the support of my mum and my family and stuff
*04:16.220- 04:19.440* :  and it's quite hard moving to a different country.
*04:19.440- 04:21.760* :  No, not you're not going to be with your family.
*04:22.260- 04:25.780* :  And the dancing, you must have found the dancing very different.
*04:26.300- 04:32.360* :  Yes, Elmerst right now, we've got a sort of curriculum for different year groups,
*04:32.360- 04:36.480* :  but back then I didn't really have that because it was just like
*04:37.100- 04:38.640* :  stuff you find on the internet.
*04:38.640- 04:40.820* :  You just kind of like trying to do it and all that sort of thing.
*04:41.440- 04:45.260* :  But now it's just based on your year group and your age.
*04:45.720- 04:49.660* :  So how would you describe what you were doing when you were dancing back in Nigeria?
*04:50.160- 04:54.860* :  I was doing Alissa Gong turns and some poets in the rain.
*04:55.320- 04:57.500* :  And now you're it's much more structured.
*04:58.100- 05:01.000* :  I wonder if some of the joy is removed from it
*05:01.060- 05:03.520* :  rather than just dancing freely in the puddles.
*05:06.120- 05:07.580* :  No, go on.
*05:08.000- 05:14.900* :  I know that like I want to dance and right now I'm kind of like focusing on my dance lesson
*05:14.900- 05:19.960* :  and kind of like trying to get better and trying to improve like more and more
*05:19.960- 05:21.420* :  and paying attention and stuff.
*05:21.860- 05:23.380* :  Is there someone you'd like to dance like?
*05:25.180- 05:27.020* :  Yes, Calvin Royal.
*05:27.800- 05:30.980* :  He's like at the American Ballet Theatre in New York.
*05:32.360- 05:34.420* :  And that's the dream to dance like him.
*05:35.040- 05:35.340* :  Yes.
*05:36.060- 05:37.400* :  How do you feel when you dance?
*05:38.240- 05:39.380* :  It's art.
*05:39.380- 05:45.960* :  You feel the sense of freedom and sort of kind of like peace in some ways.
*05:46.900- 05:50.180* :  And for me sometimes it's kind of hard to explain.
*05:50.180- 05:57.080* :  I just don't really feel any other sort of like negative emotions as if I just go with it.
*05:58.100- 06:01.420* :  Well, for those of us who haven't seen the movie, is it any good?
*06:02.260- 06:03.540* :  Yes, it is.
*06:03.880- 06:08.400* :  I would recommend when you're watching it have like a tissue box because you're probably going to cry
*06:08.880- 06:09.380* :  because I did.
*06:11.080- 06:11.980* :  Antony Maddie.
*06:12.980- 06:19.720* :  She's just reached her 67th birthday and had a party along with a special fruit platter to celebrate.
*06:19.740- 06:25.600* :  Nothing unusual there except she is a gorilla and believed to be the world's oldest of her kind.
*06:25.680- 06:28.980* :  They don't usually live much beyond the age of 35,
*06:28.980- 06:34.040* :  but Fatu, as she's known, is thriving as the resident gorilla at Berlin Zoo.
*06:34.860- 06:40.420* :  I've been talking to Svenja Eisenbart from the zoo about Fatu and her celebratory party.
*06:41.320- 06:43.100* :  She is a living legend.
*06:43.100- 06:45.340* :  She's a western lowland gorilla.
*06:45.760- 06:53.260* :  This is a gorilla species which is found in central Africa and Fatu herself has a curious
*06:53.960- 07:02.820* :  story, a heart-drinking sailor used Fatu as a payment in Marseille, France in the 50s.
*07:03.140- 07:10.640* :  And then Fatu came to Berlin and she was warmly welcomed and given a home for the last 60 years.
*07:11.360- 07:17.120* :  We took care of Fatu and she is a really nice senior gorilla.
*07:17.120- 07:18.180* :  She is calm.
*07:18.600- 07:21.980* :  She's relaxed and she's a really peaceful animal.
*07:21.980- 07:30.780* :  Gorillas are always really smooth and calm, but yeah, she don't give the sh** about stress anymore.
*07:32.320- 07:36.480* :  And I believe you gave her really quite a birthday party. Tell us about that.
*07:36.840- 07:40.080* :  Fatu always gets a tasty surprise for her birthday.
*07:40.080- 07:47.340* :  In this year we put together a fruit basket, wedge the balls and she liked it really much.
*07:47.580- 07:52.140* :  For once there was some fruit in it because you have to know that the fruits,
*07:52.140- 08:00.160* :  that we humans buy in the shops is much more sugary than the fruit in the regions where the
*08:00.160- 08:01.880* :  animals have their natural habitat.
*08:01.880- 08:07.140* :  The fruit in the basket was just an exception for Fatu's birthday.
*08:07.320- 08:12.260* :  Do you think that's why she's lived so long because it sounds like it's all pretty zen?
*08:12.260- 08:18.000* :  We think Fatu receives the best possible care just like every other animal here at the
*08:18.000- 08:22.520* :  Berlin Zoo and the keepers. They are very familiar with keeping gorillas.
*08:22.520- 08:28.480* :  A few years ago, we realized Fatu could not longer keep up with the other gorillas
*08:28.480- 08:36.160* :  because male silver bags are really much so silver bags and they like to show off.
*08:36.520- 08:39.340* :  But Fatu is not impressed by that show.
*08:39.840- 08:43.680* :  She is a sweet granny and she would prefer a little distance from the group.
*08:43.680- 08:48.900* :  So we fulfilled her wish and now she lives in a great retirement home.
*08:49.140- 08:52.140* :  But of course she can still see the other gorillas.
*08:52.140- 09:00.420* :  Our advice for gorillas would be be safe, stay healthy and then you also can be 67 years old.
*09:01.400- 09:03.800* :  Svenja Eisenbart from Berlin Zoo.
*09:04.720- 09:08.320* :  Now to a scientific breakthrough in the world of prenatal medicine.
*09:08.840- 09:13.780* :  It involves growing mini organs in a petri dish and raises the possibility of treating
*09:13.780- 09:19.360* :  certain conditions even before a baby is born. Our reporter Rebecca Wood has more.
*09:19.980- 09:26.060* :  Pregnancy is a time of great excitement for many, but alongside that it can also be a time of
*09:26.060- 09:30.760* :  great stress and worry, especially if they're concerns over the health of a baby.
*09:31.520- 09:36.700* :  So this announcement by scientists could potentially be great news for many future parents to be.
*09:37.480- 09:42.560* :  For the first time, mini organs have been grown from stem cells taken from late-stage human
*09:42.560- 09:48.380* :  pregnancy, essentially making tiny replicas of unborn children's own organs
*09:48.940- 09:51.860* :  so that their health can be monitored from outside the womb.
*09:52.520- 09:56.720* :  Professor Paolo DeCopy works at Great Ormond Street Institute of Children's Health
*09:57.060- 09:59.320* :  and was involved in this groundbreaking research.
*09:59.320- 10:06.100* :  As a fetal surgeon, it's very exciting to have opened up this possibility of really
*10:06.100- 10:12.380* :  looking specifically at the organ function, because this can open up various strategies,
*10:12.380- 10:20.300* :  both to develop new drugs or to test new drugs for these diseases, but also to in the future
*10:20.300- 10:22.420* :  things about these as a therapeutic.
*10:23.120- 10:29.320* :  So simply put, a doctor could use these tiny organs or organoids to choose the most appropriate
*10:29.320- 10:35.920* :  drugs to treat a baby all before it is even being born. The team says the technology isn't
*10:35.920- 10:42.100* :  complex or expensive. The mother would have a procedure known as amniocentesis, where a long
*10:42.100- 10:48.320* :  needle is passed through the abdomen into the uterus, and that would collect a sample of amniotic fluid.
*10:49.180- 10:54.940* :  And it's this fluid that contains the fetuses stem cells. They are then used to grow the organoids,
*10:55.040- 11:00.440* :  and if like me, you're imagining a petri dish with a teeny tiny pair of lungs or a tiny little
*11:00.940- 11:06.200* :  kidney. Think again. Dr. Mitea Gherley, a STEM researcher at University College London,
*11:06.200- 11:10.380* :  was also involved in the research. He's got another way to describe them.
*11:10.640- 11:16.680* :  Organoids are pretty much the size of the tip of a pen. I think if you want to imagine
*11:16.680- 11:23.040* :  them, they're tiny meatballs. It's a little bowl of cells. Those cells are a tissue specific,
*11:23.040- 11:28.300* :  so they resemble the cells of the fetal lunger, of the fetal kidney, or the fetal intestine.
*11:28.640- 11:32.200* :  They don't really have the shape that you would expect from a longer kidney.
*11:32.460- 11:38.120* :  They might be tiny meatballs, but they could open up huge new possibilities in prenatal medicine.
*11:38.700- 11:44.260* :  Although there is perhaps one unexpected downside, especially if you're a fetal surgeon,
*11:44.260- 11:53.040* :  like Professor Copy. It will maybe make me jobless, which would be fantastic, but we're not there yet.
*11:53.540- 11:56.740* :  Professor Paolo DeCopy ending that report from Rebecca Wood.
*11:57.800- 12:02.960* :  To the United States, and a story about one woman who's changed the lives of refugee children,
*12:03.540- 12:08.000* :  Luma Muffler is a football coach in the city of Atlanta. Originally from Jordan,
*12:08.420- 12:13.980* :  Luma sought asylum in the US after finishing university there, because she feared persecution if she
*12:13.980- 12:19.880* :  returned home on the basis of her sexuality. One day, Luma was driving home from the supermarket
*12:19.880- 12:26.300* :  when she saw a familiar sight. I saw a group of boys playing football. They had a really raggedy
*12:26.300- 12:32.440* :  football and rock set up as goals. They reminded me a little bit of home. They were playing barefoot,
*12:32.440- 12:38.300* :  so they were arguing about goals, and it was the way I grew up playing with my brothers and cousins
*12:38.300- 12:44.780* :  in the streets of Amman. I had a football in my trunk, and so I got out of my car with the ball.
*12:44.780- 12:51.860* :  They saw it. They ran to me. They wanted the ball. I wanted to play, and so he played, and I found
*12:51.860- 12:58.160* :  myself starting to make excuses to leave work early, so I could play with them, and we eventually
*12:58.160- 13:06.060* :  formed our first team. What language did you speak? Soccer, football, right? I mean, that was the
*13:06.060- 13:11.440* :  thing. That was the universal language, so we all had to communicate in English because there's so
*13:11.440- 13:18.560* :  many languages on the team, despite having to live in refugee camps or flee war, football was
*13:19.320- 13:24.940* :  comforting, and this was their sanctuary. This is where they could just escape from everything
*13:24.940- 13:30.920* :  that was going on, and just be kids and play. Then we had to do the team building, right? And part
*13:30.920- 13:35.720* :  of it is there was political dynamics coming in. We had kids from warring factions on the team.
*13:36.620- 13:40.600* :  I say, if you want to win, we've got to put some of this stuff behind us. It's about the team.
*13:41.380- 13:47.420* :  Luma was strict off the pitch, as well as on, so she would get them to sign up to an agreement.
*13:47.580- 13:53.020* :  They would be well-behaved. They would go to school. They would get good grades, and so the kids
*13:53.020- 13:58.020* :  would turn in their report cards. And what happened if they failed their classes? They could still
*13:58.020- 14:02.880* :  practice, but they can't play them again until those grades went up. And so I started helping
*14:02.880- 14:06.980* :  so the kids with their homework eventually end up being the whole team, and there's this one
*14:07.360- 14:12.040* :  day where this one kid calls me over. He said, Coach, I have a headache. Can you help me with
*14:12.040- 14:16.200* :  my homework? It was quite good, really good, particularly in self-an-English,
*14:16.700- 14:22.220* :  better than some of his peers. It's originally from Sudan, and so I read the worksheet and then
*14:22.220- 14:27.060* :  filled it out for him. And he paused, and then looked up at me and said, Coach, I can't read,
*14:27.540- 14:32.520* :  and I was floored. And I couldn't understand how a kid had been in school for three to four years
*14:32.520- 14:38.100* :  and couldn't read. And so I didn't what any coach would have done. I started a school
*14:38.880- 14:44.920* :  for him. What any coach would have done, I started a school, you made that sound so obvious
*14:44.920- 14:50.640* :  to the decision. It's a massive decision to start a school. What good coaches do is they take care
*14:50.640- 14:54.800* :  of every aspect of their player's life. I initially tried to see if there are other schools that
*14:54.800- 15:00.560* :  could take him, and there weren't any, and sending him to a private school, I couldn't afford that.
*15:00.560- 15:05.680* :  It was actually cheaper to hire one teacher, get six kids, we got a donated church basement,
*15:06.260- 15:12.240* :  and that's how it started. And then grew from Matt, and eventually had a school for 100 kids,
*15:13.260- 15:19.360* :  and then we were asked to open other locations because of the data of the growth that our students
*15:19.360- 15:25.940* :  showed compared to others in the country. So we see their experiences as assets, not as a deficit,
*15:26.260- 15:30.760* :  right? If you have been forced to leave your country, start new in a different country,
*15:31.360- 15:36.460* :  nothing's going to be able to stop you. Luma Mufflet speaking there to Joe Figen,

*17:02.020- 17:07.080* :  In southwestern China, a month-long festival to celebrate a new year is taking place.
*17:07.100- 17:12.720* :  But this isn't Chinese new year and land turns and fireworks haven't been the main attraction.
*17:13.260- 17:14.980* :  As Carrie Allen has been finding out.
*17:21.560- 17:25.400* :  In perhaps unusual scenes this week, hundreds of thousands of people have been gathering
*17:25.400- 17:31.160* :  in southwestern China for what looks like a huge water fight. There have been videos all over
*17:31.160- 17:35.920* :  Chinese media of crowds of people armed with water pistols running towards things like
*17:35.920- 17:41.040* :  army trucks and squirting soldiers with them. There have also been videos of locals running to
*17:41.040- 17:46.180* :  soak police officers with washing up bowls full of water. These have been scenes from what is known
*17:46.180- 17:51.520* :  as the annual water sprinkling or water splashing festival. It typically lasts for three days,
*17:51.520- 17:56.540* :  but some of the festivities continue until the end of the month. It's a major festival of the
*17:56.540- 18:02.280* :  Chinese diethnic group that's spelled D-A-I because it marks the beginning of the new year in the
*18:02.280- 18:07.320* :  die calendar. There are roughly around one million die people in China and communities of this
*18:07.320- 18:13.440* :  largely Buddhist group can mainly be found in southwestern Yunnan. This week, more than 400,000
*18:13.440- 18:17.980* :  people have been gathering to take part in this giant water fight in the Xishwang banner region of
*18:17.980- 18:23.600* :  China's Yunnan province. Armed with anything they can find, buckets, bowls, water guns,
*18:23.600- 18:29.080* :  the general idea is that the more water people splash on you, the luckier and happier your life will be.
*18:29.880- 18:34.580* :  In the die culture, water is seen as sacred and a symbol of spiritual purification,
*18:35.280- 18:40.500* :  splashing people as a gesture of goodwill and a wish for good luck. Many of the festivities take
*18:40.500- 18:45.360* :  part along the Lanzhang River, which is the upper regions of the Mekong, one of the longest rivers in
*18:45.360- 18:50.480* :  Asia, and actually given its geographical location, the Chinese water sprinkling festival
*18:50.480- 18:55.300* :  shares roots with a festival in Thailand known as the Songkran, where people similarly gather to
*18:55.300- 19:00.620* :  celebrate the Thai New Year and hold public waterfights. But back in China, there have been gatherings
*19:00.620- 19:06.520* :  this week at Buddhist temples, dragon boat races for the festivities, and also folk songs and dances
*19:06.520- 19:12.040* :  performed by the die people. In the evenings, it's also been common to see lanterns taking to the skies,
*19:12.060- 19:17.140* :  lit by people who want to ask the heavens for their blessings. But obviously the biggest event
*19:17.140- 19:22.560* :  has been the waterfights. Regardless of whatever your job is, however old you are and whether you
*19:22.560- 19:27.900* :  know someone or not, the festival has allowed people to go back to being kids and just having a bit of
*19:27.900- 19:38.660* :  city fun. Carry Alan. Let's head to my homeland now, Scotland, where the discovery of a medieval ring by
*19:38.660- 19:44.640* :  a metal detectorist, I don't think there may be a much bigger hole waiting to be found. But he had to
*19:44.640- 19:50.320* :  wait two years until the farmer who owned the field harvested his carrots. The delay paid off,
*19:50.560- 19:55.820* :  and Alan Baxter, the man behind the detector, ended up finding a lot more. Jacob Evans
*19:55.820- 20:00.660* :  spoke to him about his discoveries. I just couldn't move. I was fine everywhere,
*20:01.060- 20:05.240* :  kind of new in that area would be good, but I didn't, obviously I didn't expect this.
*20:05.920- 20:09.860* :  Yeah, so in total you found more than 500 different pieces of stuff.
*20:10.680- 20:15.400* :  Yeah, from the Bronze Age to the medieval period. And most of it was in pristine condition,
*20:15.400- 20:19.040* :  grey day, top examples. So when you turned up to this field, was it just
*20:19.300- 20:24.420* :  pegging off every two seconds? Yeah, literally, honestly, it was every three feet.
*20:25.020- 20:31.200* :  If it wasn't a medieval artifact or coin, it was medieval ed, medieval molten copper.
*20:31.460- 20:35.600* :  It must be so surreal when you pick something up and to think this hasn't been touched by another
*20:35.600- 20:39.960* :  human for hundreds, if not thousands of years. What's that experience like? Yeah, you've got a
*20:39.960- 20:45.480* :  tingle up your spine, your hairs, your hairs stand up on edge. It's just a fantastic feeling.
*20:45.820- 20:50.340* :  You have to actually dig up an ancient artifact for yourself to experience that,
*20:50.340- 20:55.420* :  it's just fascinating, especially an artifact that's personal, that's a personal position,
*20:55.420- 21:00.620* :  like for example, the medieval ring. Some day when they looked at that every day,
*21:00.620- 21:04.420* :  like putting on a watch every morning, and it would have meant something to them.
*21:04.780- 21:08.240* :  You once you find something that's rarely for the old, if you've got that,
*21:08.240- 21:12.640* :  or just to keep going, you just switch off, and you just listen to the background
*21:12.640- 21:17.960* :  drawn in your metal detector headphones, and you just keep your head down, and you just keep going.
*21:18.640- 21:22.940* :  It's just a while to find something else. It just gets into your blood.
*21:23.340- 21:25.980* :  Have you always loved history? No, I didn't.
*21:27.060- 21:31.720* :  Ironically, you don't understand until you go out and find stuff for yourself, how it can change
*21:31.720- 21:36.860* :  the way you feel about history, what you can learn as well on the way. You could go out and find
*21:36.860- 21:40.740* :  something, I don't know, you find the medieval coin, you'll get a buzz from that straight away.
*21:40.840- 21:43.720* :  You'll be like, wow, I'm the first person, it's not just that, for 700 years.
*21:43.940- 21:47.720* :  It's just fascinating, I mean, so much has changed in that period of time.
*21:47.720- 21:51.860* :  I mean, a lot has changed in the last 20 years. I've never been in the last 2000 years.
*21:52.100- 21:56.040* :  It's amazing, I'd love to go back in time, and rather do that than win the lottery.
*21:56.460- 22:00.300* :  I'd like to see what the medieval settlement looks like. You've got this wee picture on your mind,
*22:00.300- 22:02.360* :  but to go back and see it would just be mind blown.
*22:02.840- 22:09.180* :  Alan Baxter. If you think Kashmir, you probably think of luxury and warmth and expense.
*22:09.300- 22:15.140* :  The hair fibers for the material come from a specific breed of goat, which needs to eat so much
*22:15.140- 22:20.640* :  food that the herds destroy the environment around them. So, the fashion industry has been
*22:20.640- 22:27.320* :  searching for a more eco-friendly alternative. Enter the yak. Our friends at the podcast,
*22:27.320- 22:32.240* :  BBC People Fixing the World have been to Mongolia to find out about a new luxury
*22:32.240- 22:40.280* :  product made from yak hair. Yagel Bayambosaran sent us this report from the Gorky Teril National Park.
*22:42.380- 22:47.660* :  We are going backing up and trying to find the safer road.
*22:50.660- 22:55.980* :  I'm scared, actually. It would get stuck in the snow. There's no self-reception.
*22:56.700- 22:58.220* :  We won't be able to call anybody.
*22:59.700- 23:01.900* :  Literally, we just don't see any road here.
*23:08.920- 23:17.480* :  We finally arrived to Sadov's place. It's gorgeous here. Winter hasn't left. It's grip here.
*23:18.800- 23:20.120* :  Earth here is frozen.
*23:22.660- 23:26.340* :  Baby Yags are anticipating to see their mother.
*23:28.120- 23:35.720* :  And I see here two larger female Yags are approaching this fenced area. They're walking.
*23:37.040- 23:44.020* :  Yags are heavily built cattle with big horns on long hair that hangs down below the bellies.
*23:44.820- 23:48.540* :  They look like cows, but make it sound like a pig.
*23:53.640- 24:00.180* :  We're coming inside Sadov's house, Sadov and his family are nomadic herders.
*24:00.840- 24:04.660* :  During winter, they live in this remote spot surrounded by mountains,
*24:05.380- 24:09.980* :  but in spring and summer, they move with the animals to find fresh pastures.
*24:11.260- 24:15.780* :  This has been a way of life from ancient times from Mongolian people,
*24:16.400- 24:20.900* :  tending, raising animals, and leading a nomadic lifestyle.
*24:21.600- 24:26.920* :  Yags shed their hair naturally in springtime, and it was only ever used to make rope,
*24:27.640- 24:32.740* :  but with a growing need for more produce from herding, a special comb was developed.
*24:35.400- 24:41.000* :  Previously, we never bothered with it. There was no market for it, but this year,
*24:41.260- 24:48.120* :  the company who buys the hair are offering some incentives, so we're looking forward to it.
*24:49.060- 24:56.040* :  The interest in Yagdown, the solved hair combed by hand from the undercoat, has grown,
*24:56.880- 24:59.320* :  even if it is a struggle to get.
*25:02.320- 25:07.800* :  It's quite a wrestle. It's difficult in the beginning, but it gets easier.
*25:08.880- 25:14.400* :  Glad to hear it, and you can hear more on sustainable fashion by searching people fixing the world,
*25:14.880- 25:16.320* :  wherever you get your podcasts.
*25:17.840- 25:23.480* :  And finally, one man's social media post has gone viral after he put up pictures of a cat
*25:23.480- 25:26.840* :  that takes visitors on guided walks through the local forest,
*25:27.400- 25:31.180* :  and complains via the medium of Meow's if they go the wrong way.
*25:31.760- 25:36.820* :  The feline named Cinnamon is a tough former Brooklyn street cat, according to his owner,
*25:36.820- 25:40.740* :  who runs the Airbnb, where a cinnamon meets his clientele.
*25:41.240- 25:43.220* :  Stephanie Prentice has been finding out more.
*25:44.920- 25:50.400* :  When Sebastian Cotoba and his girlfriend booked a hiking trip to the Appalachian mountains in the US,
*25:50.400- 25:55.620* :  they knew the dense trails could be difficult to navigate. They needn't have worried.
*25:56.200- 25:59.740* :  The log cabin they booked online came with a tour guide.
*25:59.740- 26:07.440* :  We pulled up on this sunny Friday morning, and immediately we were met by this really curious
*26:07.440- 26:13.660* :  orange cat. And so we walked to the front of our door, where he was just kind of pawing at the door.
*26:13.780- 26:16.520* :  We opened it slightly and immediately just ran in.
*26:16.760- 26:22.620* :  Enter Cinnamon, the cat. 11 pounds of orange fur, whiskers, and sheer determination,
*26:23.120- 26:24.760* :  as owner Trisha explains.
*26:25.500- 26:32.260* :  He's a very lovely, lovely cat. He likes to be with humans, although he is a Brooklyn street cat.
*26:32.700- 26:36.200* :  Well, you know, those Brooklyn street cats that I have had many are really quite the things
*26:36.200- 26:42.060* :  because they're tough. Cinnamon's unique combination of street smarts and a warm heart made him the
*26:42.060- 26:50.040* :  perfect tour guide. As soon as we started heading towards where the trail was, the cat was following us.
*26:50.420- 26:53.720* :  And we couldn't actually find the entrance to the trailhead. We couldn't figure out where it was,
*26:53.720- 26:59.480* :  and Cinnamon essentially just guided us there. And as soon as we got to the point where Trisha's path
*26:59.480- 27:03.480* :  met the Appalachian Trail, the cat started walking ahead of us as if guiding.
*27:04.780- 27:06.880* :  A beautiful hiking group was born.
*27:07.580- 27:12.040* :  There were so many moments where the cat would go up ahead and just stare at us.
*27:12.560- 27:16.900* :  And at one point we got to apart in the trail that makes like a hairpin right turn.
*27:16.900- 27:20.460* :  But there was also a path leading up towards the top left, or we thought it was a path.
*27:21.000- 27:24.540* :  So we walked a little bit ahead and then we heard meowing continuously.
*27:25.240- 27:29.660* :  And so we backed up. And as soon as we went on the proper part of the trail, Cinnamon continued
*27:29.660- 27:31.660* :  to follow us again and then started to lead.
*27:31.900- 27:36.100* :  The woods around the cabin are also home to bears, cougars and wolves,
*27:36.100- 27:39.680* :  something Cinnamon bears in mind when shepherding his guests.
*27:39.680- 27:46.140* :  There's a few that come regularly. And one of them has a little kid and they stopped me and they
*27:46.140- 27:50.680* :  said, you know, we were walking in the woods with our little kid and we would have gotten lost,
*27:50.680- 27:54.760* :  but Cinnamon was there and Cinnamon really made sure we got home okay.
*27:56.640- 28:02.800* :  Cinnamon's meowkassa sukassa attitude to his home has earned him a loyal fan base
*28:02.800- 28:06.220* :  with rebookings for the cabin at an all time high.
*28:06.620- 28:09.800* :  You wouldn't believe since that tiktok thing came out.
*28:10.640- 28:14.160* :  I have had so many people always Cinnamon going to be there.
*28:14.160- 28:20.000* :  I want to see Cinnamon. We have some repeat visitors that come specifically for the cat.
*28:20.520- 28:24.180* :  As for Sebastian, how would he rate his tour guide out of 10?
*28:24.540- 28:27.960* :  After all the wonderful guide services at least a 13 out of 10,
*28:28.100- 28:31.280* :  definitely looking out for orange adventure cats in my life for sure.
*28:32.680- 28:35.940* :  Stephanie Prentice on Cinnamon the tour guide cat.
