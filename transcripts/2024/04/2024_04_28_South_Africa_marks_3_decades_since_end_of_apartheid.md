*01:19.780- 01:23.520* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.420- 01:30.680* :  And Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Sunday, the 28th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:31.060- 01:34.640* :  30 years on from the first democratic elections in South Africa,
*01:35.100- 01:38.060* :  President Rabaposa outlines the events' importance.
*01:38.640- 01:45.700* :  South Africa, our country, changed forever in signal in a new chapter in the history of our nation,
*01:45.700- 01:50.320* :  a moment that resonated across Africa and across the world.
*01:50.880- 01:57.340* :  A new video of two Israeli hostages is posted by Hamas. The released daughter of one of the men said,
*01:59.520- 02:05.160* :  I demand that the leaders of this country watch this video and see their own father crying out for help.
*02:05.840- 02:12.320* :  Australia holds a nationwide weekend of rallies to highlight the scourge of violence against women.
*02:15.040- 02:19.780* :  Also in this podcast, experts say a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica
*02:20.300- 02:24.300* :  is exposing wildlife to the sun's most harmful rays and
*02:24.780- 02:28.740* :  they thought I was only a little child this year.
*02:33.960- 02:39.860* :  The passenger aged 101, who was classed as being just one by an airline.
*02:45.460- 02:50.120* :  30 years ago, this weekend, for the first time millions of Black South Africans
*02:50.140- 02:56.200* :  voted in their country's democratic elections, a right they'd been denied by a white minority
*02:56.200- 03:00.940* :  government under the apartheid regime. On Freedom Day, on Saturday, President
*03:00.940- 03:05.820* :  Rabaposa honored those he said had brought peace and freedom to South Africa.
*03:06.500- 03:12.940* :  In an address at the main ceremony in Pretoria, he described the first democratic elections back in 1994
*03:12.940- 03:16.680* :  as a victory for human dignity and reconciliation.
*03:20.800- 03:28.620* :  That we achieved was much about liberating South Africans from apartheid as it was,
*03:29.560- 03:37.520* :  about free white South Africans from their prejudice and fear. As President Nelson Mandela said,
*03:38.720- 03:47.680* :  the system of apartheid robbed both the oppressed and the oppressor alike of their humanity.
*03:48.580- 03:54.720* :  But three decades later, all is not well in the rainbow nation. A head of crucial elections next
*03:54.720- 04:01.060* :  month, South Africans are asking serious questions about whether the promises made by the democratically
*04:01.060- 04:06.560* :  elected African National Congress have been delivered. The BBC's southern Africa correspondent
*04:06.580- 04:09.460* :  Nomsamaseko has been speaking to some of them.
*04:14.100- 04:18.700* :  Villagazi Street here in Orlando West, so where to, carries a rich history.
*04:19.540- 04:25.240* :  South Africa's first black president Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Troutu once lived here.
*04:25.920- 04:31.400* :  With the country struggling with a high unemployment rate, many are relying on tourism here,
*04:31.880- 04:36.880* :  as visitors come to learn about the history of the struggle against the racist apartheid system.
*04:39.740- 04:46.640* :  Street performers Cylian Dance, restaurants serve food and traders sell clothes in souvenirs.
*04:48.520- 04:55.140* :  Just a 10-minute drive away is a very different way to the one most tourist see. People here are
*04:55.140- 05:01.840* :  disillusioned. Tasnima Silvesta is a 38-year-old mother of three. How do you feel about celebrating
*05:01.840- 05:07.440* :  30 years of democracy? I don't feel there's something to celebrate because I'm unemployed,
*05:07.440- 05:13.840* :  no running water, no toilets. There's basically no services for us here. Are you going to be
*05:13.840- 05:20.200* :  voting this year? No, because I haven't seen any changes that the ANC has done. I usually vote
*05:20.200- 05:24.160* :  but this year I don't. Democracy means nothing to me.
*05:28.020- 05:34.140* :  One of the best examples of the service delivery crisis that extends in all directions is that
*05:34.140- 05:39.320* :  hundreds of trained medical doctors have been staged in protests because they can't find work.
*05:40.160- 05:45.900* :  They're demanding permanent jobs, both because they need to live and they want to serve.
*05:46.440- 05:51.700* :  I'm Dr. Mumtaz Emmer and Thomas. People call me Dr. Tas. Dr. Tas is the first
*05:51.700- 05:57.180* :  graduate in her family. She's surviving on freelance work outside of the medical fraternity.
*05:57.500- 06:05.660* :  30 years of democracy for me has afforded me the opportunity to be a coloured female medical doctor,
*06:05.720- 06:11.180* :  the first generation medical doctor in my family. However, it's also highlighted a very sad reality.
*06:11.820- 06:17.780* :  The people of South Africa are in dire need of healthcare. Yet we have a collapsing healthcare
*06:17.780- 06:23.800* :  system and that's why we have 800 unemployed doctors. So 30 years of democracy, what that means
*06:23.800- 06:31.020* :  for me is being robbed of opportunity and hope that was once promised to us.
*06:34.640- 06:41.200* :  Political violence in the years right before the 1994 vote almost derailed South Africa's own
*06:41.200- 06:47.300* :  transition to democracy. Conflict over the tactics for opposing a partake broke out between
*06:47.300- 06:53.000* :  supporters of the African National Congress and being at a freedom party. Black communities
*06:53.000- 06:59.220* :  were mostly affected. I met men who risked their lives for the ANC during the conflict.
*06:59.260- 07:03.920* :  Domisani Kumano is one of them. We are still growing, we're still a very young
*07:03.920- 07:08.600* :  democracy. If you look at it, 30 years is not a very long time. The air party government
*07:08.600- 07:16.000* :  was in power for 48 years. We've moved, we've got a lot of gains like the government is trying to
*07:16.000- 07:25.360* :  bring services to the people we're trying to move. With upcoming elections on the 29th of May,
*07:26.000- 07:31.820* :  South Africa is counting the gains of the last three decades, with many asking what the next
*07:31.820- 07:38.840* :  30 years hold for the rainbow nation. While turnout at the last election was the lowest since 1994,
*07:39.480- 07:45.360* :  many South Africans still believe in the power of the ballot box. Here's Dr. Tez again.
*07:45.800- 07:50.840* :  Voting was the one thing that installed hope into South Africa and it can still be that one
*07:50.840- 07:57.580* :  thing that installs hope back into South Africa. Dr. Tez ending that report by Nomsomaseko.
*07:58.420- 08:03.400* :  Ukraine says there's fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops over an area of the
*08:03.400- 08:08.680* :  annex region in the east of the country. It comes as Russia has again inflicted heavy damage
*08:08.680- 08:14.820* :  to Ukraine's energy infrastructure. In Karchit, in the northeast of the country, a psychiatric hospital
*08:14.820- 08:20.100* :  was almost hit, an attack that prompted the city's mayor, Yehaterikov, to make this appeal.
*08:25.080- 08:30.780* :  The main task is to close the sky of a Harkiv. For this, we need the most modern air defenses.
*08:31.380- 08:35.980* :  Of course, this could only be achieved with the help of our international partners. I once said
*08:35.980- 08:41.540* :  that the international community must unite around Harkiv so that it doesn't turn into another
*08:41.540- 08:48.380* :  Aleppo. President Zelensky insists that every Russian missile and drone could be shot down
*08:48.380- 08:54.940* :  if Ukraine is provided with more air defenses. Our correspondent, James Waters, is in Southern Ukraine.
*08:55.840- 09:02.020* :  Well, even by the standards of this war, this was a night of busy skies, where you have the Ukrainian
*09:02.020- 09:09.580* :  authorities saying that Russia launched 34 missiles from land, sea, and air, and it was a large
*09:09.580- 09:16.280* :  scale attack, where you have these power stations reportedly hit in the far-western parts of Ukraine,
*09:16.280- 09:24.660* :  as well as in the eastern city of Nipro, as well as Harkiv city in the northeast, where we're told
*09:24.660- 09:30.900* :  a psychiatric hospital was narrowly missed with a thousand people inside. President Zelensky has
*09:30.900- 09:36.780* :  used these strikes to renew his pleas for air defense systems. Yes, this western aid is coming in,
*09:36.780- 09:42.660* :  but he is saying western allies have the resources to stop every Russian missile from hitting
*09:42.820- 09:48.180* :  Ukrainian targets. So he's used that political opportunity, but this wasn't a night of one-way
*09:48.180- 09:53.640* :  traffic. You have Russian authorities in the southern Krasnodar region saying they intercepted
*09:53.640- 09:59.760* :  more than 60 drones launched by Ukraine. They say two oil refineries were hit, and now our reports
*09:59.760- 10:07.640* :  at an air base two. The U.S. at one point warned Ukraine about hitting energy sites inside Russia
*10:07.640- 10:14.280* :  over fears of energy price rises and an escalation in this war. It is clear from last night that
*10:14.280- 10:21.060* :  Kiev still does not share in those concerns. James Waterhouse. Weeks of indirect negotiations
*10:21.060- 10:25.900* :  between Hamas and the Israeli government have failed to secure a truce, with the fate of
*10:25.900- 10:31.600* :  more than 100 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza a key sticking point. More than six months
*10:31.600- 10:38.460* :  after the mass kidnappings, Hamas has posted another proof-of-life video. This time two male hostages,
*10:38.460- 10:43.600* :  Keith Siegel and Obritwehran appeared in the footage. Similarly, speaking under duress,
*10:43.780- 10:48.000* :  they said they were hoping for a deal that would see them and the other hostages returned home.
*10:48.740- 10:53.340* :  After seeing her father Keith in the video, Ilan Siegel urged Israel to make a deal.
*10:56.660- 11:02.440* :  Seeing my father today only emphasises to all of us how much we must reach a deal as soon as
*11:02.440- 11:08.600* :  possible and bring everyone home. I demand that the leaders of this country watch this video
*11:08.600- 11:11.180* :  and see their own father crying out for help.
*11:11.480- 11:15.220* :  Benjamin Netanyahu's government has been under pressure from the families since October
*11:15.220- 11:20.320* :  the 7th. The families have been holding regular protest demanding action. I'm at least
*11:20.320- 11:23.900* :  an analyst Sebastian Usher reports now on Saturday's developments.
*11:49.880- 11:55.740* :  Israel must choose between hostages or war and that a planned military incursion into Rafa
*11:56.120- 12:00.560* :  the southernmost town in Gaza would cause more of those who've been abducted to die.
*12:01.000- 12:06.400* :  Talks on securing the release of the hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza have been continuing
*12:06.400- 12:11.700* :  but a deal has yet to be agreed in Israel. Big protests are again taking place demanding new
*12:11.700- 12:16.360* :  elections and for the safety of the hostages to be the government's priority.
*12:16.960- 12:23.220* :  Sebastian Usher in the United States police have ended another pro-Palestinian student protest
*12:23.220- 12:27.020* :  after the University authorities said the demonstrators were using what they called
*12:27.020- 12:33.120* :  virulent antisemitic slogans. Northeastern University in Boston said about 100 people,
*12:33.120- 12:39.340* :  a mix of students and outsiders were detained. At Columbia University in New York the epicenter
*12:39.340- 12:44.080* :  of the protests, one student leader has been barred from the site and officials are looking
*12:44.080- 12:49.380* :  to hide the protests there are being handled. From there Nome Ekebel centres this report.
*12:56.800- 13:02.160* :  Another day and another encampment has cropped up in the US. In this part of New York students
*13:02.160- 13:10.680* :  are camped outside the city college. Sarah is Palestinian American.
*13:10.920- 13:15.320* :  And I'm here to risk it all for Palestine and I think that's the bare minimum we can do.
*13:15.320- 13:19.760* :  That's the bare minimum anyone can do. Students here and faculty here are not scared of anything.
*13:19.760- 13:23.960* :  They know that there is a risk of arrest. They know there is a risk of suspension but they're
*13:23.960- 13:28.180* :  willing to stand here and risk it all for Palestine and for divestment.
*13:30.840- 13:37.940* :  Sergei Wamp studied at this university. He describes himself as very pro-Israel.
*13:38.220- 13:44.320* :  I do find it unfair that certain groups are allowed to occupy public space, block people's access
*13:44.320- 13:50.540* :  to those spaces. I do find it offensive when my people are accused of genocide when we defend
*13:50.540- 13:56.840* :  ourselves but the same time I do recognize freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and to non-violently
*13:56.840- 13:59.700* :  express their views however much I disagree with them.
*14:06.640- 14:12.200* :  This protest is peaceful but police are bringing in large silver barricades as the crowd gets bigger.
*14:16.040- 14:19.640* :  Tensions between officers and students have led to an escalation across
*14:19.640- 14:28.040* :  many parts of America. From Georgia to Texas to Ohio and California there have been hundreds
*14:28.040- 14:39.360* :  of arrests with students accused of trespassing. The protest was started here by Columbia University
*14:39.360- 14:44.640* :  students more than a week ago. Tensions have been fraught between those who are pro-Palestinian
*14:44.640- 14:49.620* :  and those who are pro-Israeli. Both sides are accusing each other of hate speech. One student
*14:49.620- 14:55.660* :  has since apologized for prior remarks saying Zionists don't deserve to live. He's been barred
*14:55.660- 15:01.260* :  from the protest site. It's much calmer here at Columbia University today. I'm literally
*15:01.680- 15:06.820* :  outside the encampment so there's a black fence that runs all the way across. We're not allowed
*15:06.820- 15:12.560* :  to enter the encampment as media. Security is tight given the events of the last few days
*15:13.200- 15:18.500* :  but people are milling about. There's a very positive atmosphere here. You've got many students
*15:18.500- 15:23.120* :  who've got their laptops open. They're doing their schoolwork and there are some people who have
*15:23.120- 15:27.440* :  their faces covered either with face masks or scarves and they have said it's because they're worried
*15:27.440- 15:31.840* :  due to the political position they've taken that it might result in them being kicked off their
*15:31.840- 15:38.760* :  course, that their identity could compromise their future careers. But they also say that they
*15:38.760- 15:43.960* :  are sticking to their demands and what they're demanding, which is the same as students protesting
*15:43.960- 15:51.620* :  at universities elsewhere in the country, is for their university leaders to cut economic
*15:51.620- 15:57.100* :  and academic ties with Israeli institutions. And the students here say they're not budging
*15:57.100- 16:03.380* :  until that happens. Nomeh Agbel. An exhibition is underway at the British Library here in London
*16:03.380- 16:08.900* :  on 50 years of black British music covering the places where particular sounds were born,
*16:08.900- 16:14.940* :  the people who created them and their musical influences. The singer-songwriter Eddie Grant
*16:14.940- 16:20.640* :  who had hits in the 80s including Electric Avenue and Gibby Hope Joanna was one of the contributors.
*16:21.280- 16:26.100* :  He spoke to Misha Hussein about the music that shaped him from the beginning when he first
*16:26.100- 16:28.960* :  came to the UK from Guyana at the age of 12.
*16:38.020- 16:43.880* :  Well let's go back. I would have been hearing music from the border countries. Radio Luxembourg
*16:43.880- 16:50.200* :  would have been the equivalent of music coming from Suriname. I would have been hearing loads and
*16:50.200- 17:03.640* :  loads of the mighty Sparrow. Sparrow was so far ahead of his contemporaries that it would have
*17:03.640- 17:10.380* :  been a synagogues card not to have been playing his music consistently in Guyana.
*17:10.560- 17:12.460* :  I'm ready to make up that. Let's go.
*17:14.720- 17:22.140* :  Having left Guyana confusion rain because traditional jazz was very popular in England
*17:22.140- 17:30.000* :  in the 60s. Quite into the 70s actually. I decided to get involved in making a kind of hybrid
*17:30.000- 17:37.760* :  Jamaican, Guyanese, Trinidadian music and Prince Bustard have been the person that I would have
*17:37.920- 17:39.200* :  copied at that time.
*17:47.760- 17:54.600* :  Soul music made its appearance. You had a massive mixture taking place and England being
*17:54.600- 18:02.760* :  so small relative to America and having one real radio station which was a BBC. The impact
*18:02.760- 18:10.560* :  became very strong. You had then people like John males, loose breakers, the rolling stones,
*18:10.620- 18:17.940* :  the beetles coming up with all the exotic are from America that a back kid in London wouldn't
*18:17.940- 18:22.640* :  have necessarily been in contact with so they had a lot of catching up to do.
*18:22.820- 18:28.640* :  How conscious were you of the women who were coming through? I'm thinking in particular of
*18:28.740- 18:32.660* :  Joan Armitraiding and her very distinct sound.
*18:41.300- 18:49.100* :  John's music had a tremendous impact on pop music and you can hear John in Tracy Chapman.
*18:49.320- 18:56.320* :  You can hear almost every girl that has come out of English popular music as in some way
*18:56.320- 19:02.760* :  being touched by Joan Armitraiding. She was the one off as far as English black. I mean,
*19:02.800- 19:04.760* :  English any music was concerned.
*19:10.640- 19:18.140* :  And then in the 80s Eddie when you were having success with hits like Electric Avenue and then
*19:18.140- 19:23.560* :  you also went on to do Gimme Hope Joanna which was a sign of the times because it's an anti-apartheid song.
*19:23.800- 19:32.000* :  In my time there was still the guys like Harry Beckett, Joe Harriet and guys out of Africa.
*19:32.000- 19:39.020* :  All of these guys were playing and contributing to what was being called white music at the time.
*19:39.020- 19:46.000* :  You just got to be honest. Say what you've seen, say what you've heard and it may be able to direct
*19:46.580- 19:49.760* :  the future in some little meaningful way.
*19:56.840- 19:59.960* :  And that was Eddie Grant speaking there to Michelle Hussein.
*20:02.840- 20:07.960* :  Still to come here on the Global News Podcast scientific evidence that some form of life
*20:07.960- 20:11.340* :  might exist outside our solar system.
*20:11.840- 20:15.960* :  Of all the thousands of planets we know this is the only planet currently known which is
*20:16.060- 20:17.040* :  potentially habitable.
*20:24.360- 20:29.260* :  There were angry protests on the streets of Sydney, Australia on Saturday as demonstrators called
*20:29.260- 20:34.800* :  for an end to violence against women which organisers describe as a form of terrorism.
*20:35.360- 20:38.080* :  They say it should be treated as a national emergency.
*20:45.340- 20:50.700* :  Some campaign groups claim violence against women is at epidemic proportions and serious
*20:50.700- 20:55.180* :  political action is desperate. It comes down to educating our sons.
*20:55.220- 20:59.680* :  I shouldn't have to tell my daughter how to address, how to act, what to say,
*20:59.680- 21:04.240* :  but I tell my son how to treat women and what relationships should be like.
*21:04.740- 21:09.480* :  I think the government needs to declare this devastating thing that's happening to women as
*21:09.480- 21:13.400* :  a national emergency. Enough women have died because it's really upsetting and we shouldn't be
*21:13.400- 21:18.740* :  getting killed. As our Sydney correspondent for Immersor explains violence against women has been
*21:18.740- 21:25.140* :  an issue for years. A while ago there were widespread demonstrations in this country demanding
*21:25.140- 21:30.820* :  change to the way that women, for example, were being treated in the workplace and also the way
*21:30.820- 21:35.300* :  that women were being treated in the national parliament two or three years ago.
*21:35.300- 21:40.540* :  So certainly these sentiments aren't new, but we get the sense that the murders of those five
*21:40.540- 21:46.200* :  women in that stabbing rampage at a place called Bondi Junction in Sydney a couple of weeks ago
*21:46.200- 21:54.460* :  has further inflamed these sentiments. What protesters want is firstly tougher laws to protect women.
*21:54.460- 22:00.480* :  The government here in Australia wants to, for example, review coercive control laws in
*22:00.480- 22:08.420* :  this country and also bail applications from suspects with a history of violence. So no one knows
*22:08.420- 22:15.080* :  for sure why this violence is continuing, but campaigners believe that tougher laws are part
*22:15.080- 22:22.200* :  of the answer and also a cultural change on men's treatment of women and attitudes towards them
*22:22.200- 22:28.420* :  in this country because Australia often has this reputation of being a very macho and a very
*22:28.420- 22:35.540* :  blokey place for the people of Australia. They are hearing government figures that say that
*22:35.540- 22:41.820* :  a woman is being killed on average every four days. There will be pressure on the Australian
*22:41.820- 22:47.960* :  government given that there's an election due in the next 12 months or so. This may well become
*22:47.960- 22:54.780* :  an election issue, but for many many Australians it is already a burning social issue that demands
*22:54.780- 23:02.320* :  a social and a political antidote. For a murder in Sydney, a hole in the ozone layer, the protective
*23:02.320- 23:08.280* :  barrier of gas in the atmosphere is causing problems for wildlife in the Antarctic. That's
*23:08.280- 23:13.580* :  according to climate scientists and an article in the journal Global Change Biology. The hole
*23:13.580- 23:19.920* :  usually appears annually, peaking in September or October before closing once again in the Antarctic
*23:19.980- 23:25.640* :  summer. But now scientists say the gap is bigger and is lasting longer, posing a threat to animals
*23:25.640- 23:31.500* :  living there because of harmful UV rays which are coming through. As the lead researcher Professor
*23:31.500- 23:37.960* :  Sharon Robinson told Rebecca Kesby, the extra UV that comes through is particularly of concern in
*23:37.960- 23:43.080* :  December because that's when all of the animals and plants start growing and having chicks and
*23:43.080- 23:48.240* :  seal pups and all of those sorts of things. So there's a lot more life in Antarctica in December
*23:48.240- 23:53.440* :  than there is in September which is when the ozone hole it still opens then but it's not so
*23:53.440- 23:58.020* :  damaging at that time of year because there's not a snow cover over everything looking after it.
*23:58.200- 24:03.880* :  So just explain a little bit for us what the ozone layer does in terms of protecting us all
*24:04.360- 24:09.900* :  and the harmful effect of UV rays and how they might be affecting the wildlife there.
*24:10.100- 24:16.460* :  The ozone layer is our primary protection from ultraviolet B radiation and so when we have a nice
*24:16.460- 24:22.020* :  thick layer of ozone in the stratosphere that means that we get very little of the sun's UV
*24:22.020- 24:29.100* :  radiation especially UVB reaching the Earth's surface and that's important because UVB radiation
*24:29.100- 24:35.660* :  in humans it causes skin cancer cataracts in our eyes. We don't think that seals and penguins will
*24:35.660- 24:40.740* :  probably be getting skin cancer because they have feathers and fur which probably protect them quite
*24:40.740- 24:46.560* :  well but their eyes could well be vulnerable to cataracts in the same way that we are and we know
*24:46.560- 24:51.360* :  that the plants have to make sunscreens if there's high UV and that comes at a cost so they
*24:51.360- 24:57.140* :  can protect themselves but they put more energy into protecting their cells from damage and that
*24:57.140- 25:02.440* :  means they've got less energy to grow and to reproduce. And it's having an impact on some species
*25:02.440- 25:08.900* :  behavior too I understand I was reading about krill which is so central isn't it all life in that
*25:08.900- 25:14.640* :  area? Yeah the base of the food web which feed the penguins and the seals and the whales the krill
*25:14.640- 25:19.560* :  basically are feeding on the edges of the sea ice they're feeding off algae they can actually
*25:19.560- 25:25.160* :  take up some compounds from the algae that may give them some sun protection but the main thing they
*25:25.160- 25:30.760* :  seem to do is to dive deeper into the water and that behavioral modification can then mean that
*25:31.080- 25:35.940* :  again if they're deeper in the water if they're not feeding as well then that can affect the whole
*25:35.940- 25:42.820* :  food chain. Have you managed to work out what's causing this change in this hole? We haven't done
*25:42.860- 25:47.420* :  that work but the main concern has been that the last four years the ozone hole has extended
*25:47.420- 25:53.100* :  into December. The first year that that happened was when we had really terrible bushfires here in
*25:53.100- 26:00.060* :  Australia during the summer of 2019 and into 2020 and those fires were so intense that they put
*26:00.500- 26:06.020* :  smoke up into the stratosphere and those chemicals were able to accelerate the ozone depletion
*26:06.200- 26:11.680* :  and cause the ozone hole to be bigger that year and then we've had two large volcanic eruptions
*26:11.740- 26:17.820* :  in the following two years and those two volcanoes will also have put compounds into the stratosphere
*26:17.820- 26:25.560* :  like sulfates and water vapor that again can help to accelerate ozone depletion. The concern now is
*26:25.560- 26:30.680* :  that these additional compounds that are going into the into the stratosphere potentially as a
*26:30.680- 26:37.640* :  result of bushfires will do damage and delay the recovery. Climate biologist Professor Sharon Robinson
*26:38.460- 26:43.440* :  Cambodia's Prime Minister says 20 soldiers have been killed and several others injured in an
*26:43.440- 26:48.120* :  explosion at an ammunition's depot in the south of the country. Here's Silia Hatten.
*26:48.760- 26:53.740* :  The only source of information on the deadly explosion appears to be Cambodia's Prime Minister
*26:53.740- 27:00.240* :  Hun Mane who revealed the incident in a Facebook post. He said he was deeply shocked by Saturday
*27:00.240- 27:06.300* :  afternoon's blast in the southern province of Camp Hong Spu, which also injured several others.
*27:07.100- 27:13.120* :  No explanation has been given for the explosion but Hun Mane said he had instructed his government
*27:13.120- 27:20.500* :  to pay compensation of $20,000 to each family member that lost a soldier and their full funeral
*27:20.500- 27:28.100* :  expenses. Cambodia has almost no independent media outlets so more details of the incident will
*27:28.100- 27:34.860* :  probably only be revealed of the government wishes to disclose them. Silia Hatten ever since the
*27:34.860- 27:40.660* :  James Webb telescope was launched it's come up with images of distant galaxies that have delighted
*27:40.660- 27:47.880* :  astronomers. Now the telescope is investigating possible signs of life on a planet 124 light
*27:47.880- 27:55.840* :  years from us here on earth. The planet called K218B is causing lots of excitement because it seems
*27:55.840- 28:01.780* :  to have a gas which scientists think can only be produced by living organisms. Simon Jack has
*28:01.780- 28:07.140* :  been hearing more about this discovery from Nikku Matsudan as scientist at Cambridge University.
*28:07.580- 28:12.760* :  So this was last year when we saw a tentative science of this molecule dimethyl sulfide. It was not
*28:12.760- 28:20.000* :  robust at that time. So now yesterday we made the next observations with the James Webb Space Telescope
*28:20.000- 28:26.260* :  that is going to tell us if the signal was real or not. And what kind of life would produce this gas?
*28:26.260- 28:32.340* :  Can it be only life that does it? So on earth it is only life that does it and it's mostly
*28:32.340- 28:39.080* :  microorganisms in the earth's oceans that produce this gas. We obviously don't know in another
*28:39.080- 28:45.300* :  planet what else could be producing it but so far the only channels we know of on earth are due to
*28:45.300- 28:50.620* :  life which is why this is a strong potential biosignature. And are the conditions I think it's
*28:50.620- 28:57.760* :  called K218B? Are they consistent with life as we know it? So they're consistent with habitability
*28:58.000- 29:03.900* :  in the sense that theoretical models have shown in the past that you could have a liquid water
*29:03.900- 29:10.760* :  ocean on the planet with habitable conditions similar to what we have on earth. So in that sense it
*29:10.760- 29:16.500* :  has the potential to sustain life but whether it has life or not we don't know obviously which is
*29:16.500- 29:22.240* :  why we are making these observations. And how unusual is it to find this gas? So in an exoplanet
*29:22.240- 29:27.500* :  in a planet outside the solar system we have never had anything like this before. In fact this is
*29:27.500- 29:32.860* :  the only planet currently known of all the thousands of planets we exoplanet know this is the only
*29:32.860- 29:37.200* :  planet currently known which is potentially habitable and who knows the atmosphere so we have found
*29:37.200- 29:43.180* :  other molecules like methane and CO2 carbon dioxide we have found very robustly in this. So far in
*29:43.180- 29:48.540* :  exoplanets we don't have any faults even falls detection of this particular molecule but obviously in
*29:48.540- 29:54.300* :  the solar system we have examples of some gases like phosphine of venous on venous and so on which
*29:54.300- 30:00.920* :  are being debated. Professor Nikku Matsudan from Cambridge University and finally has an airline
*30:00.920- 30:06.920* :  ever lost your luggage or overbooked a plane so you can't travel when planned. When American
*30:06.920- 30:15.600* :  airlines gaff arguably beats both hands down by registering a passenger of 101 years old as a baby.
*30:15.600- 30:27.940* :  Ella Bicknell picks up the tail. Being 101 years old might stop you from doing a few things but
*30:27.940- 30:33.580* :  for Patricia air travel is not one of them so imagine the confusion and amusement are to
*30:33.580- 30:49.300* :  Estuids expected her to be a one year old baby. Patricia from Michigan's data birth caused
*30:49.300- 30:54.640* :  the airline computer system to malfunction and incorrectly register as a one year old infant.
*30:54.640- 30:59.620* :  It was on a flight north from Chicago to market that Patricia shared the exchange with the
*30:59.620- 31:06.240* :  air crew she told the BBC that it's a mix up that's happened before. They did it last year
*31:06.240- 31:14.260* :  as well. They kept insisting that I was going to give a child wheelchair.
*31:14.920- 31:20.500* :  Patricia's story has been a hit on social media with more than 1.7 million views on ex.
*31:20.500- 31:26.080* :  The centenarian has found it musing on both occasions but she says that she would like the glitch
*31:26.080- 31:31.500* :  to stop as it causes problems when airport staff don't have car transport ready for her.
*31:31.760- 31:35.980* :  We asked American airlines if they wanted to comment but we've yet to receive a response.
*31:35.980- 31:42.200* :  The former nurse flies every literacy family to escape the cold winters. She says on both occasions
*31:42.200- 31:46.940* :  the staff at American Airlines have been kind and helpful in spite of the confusion.
*31:48.900- 31:53.760* :  Patricia says that the mix up isn't going to stop her from travel with her next white book later
*31:53.760- 31:57.560* :  this year by which time she'll be a hundred and two.
*31:59.600- 32:00.720* :  Ella Picnell reporting.
