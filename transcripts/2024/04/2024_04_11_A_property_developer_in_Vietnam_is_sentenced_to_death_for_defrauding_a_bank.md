*01:13.500- 01:16.580* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:18.080- 01:22.020* :  I'm Andrew Peachan at 13 hours GMT on Thursday 11th of April.
*01:22.020- 01:23.340* :  These are our main stories.
*01:23.340- 01:29.000* :  A property developer in Vietnam is sentenced to death for defrauding a bank of billions of dollars
*01:29.000- 01:31.340* :  in one of the biggest corruption cases ever.
*01:31.980- 01:36.560* :  President Zelensky makes a plea for more air defenses after a third of Russia's strikes on
*01:36.560- 01:39.300* :  energy infrastructure overnight and not intercepted.
*01:39.820- 01:43.380* :  And South Korea's Prime Minister Handuk Su offers his resignation.
*01:45.480- 01:50.500* :  Also in this podcast, more security on the New York subway after incidents of gun violence.
*01:51.500- 01:55.940* :  Rambling off statistics, saying things are getting better doesn't make you feel better.
*01:56.160- 02:01.100* :  Especially when you've just heard about someone being slashed in the throat or thrown on to a subway's tracks.
*02:05.340- 02:10.040* :  First, the Vietnamese property tycoon, Trong Milan, has been sentenced to death as part of one
*02:10.040- 02:13.620* :  of the world's biggest ever-fraud cases involving billions of dollars.
*02:14.200- 02:17.960* :  Along with more than 80 others, she was arrested as part of a crackdown on corruption.
*02:17.960- 02:24.140* :  She denied the charges and blamed other employees claiming to have a little knowledge of the banking sector.
*02:24.720- 02:29.320* :  But the court found she knowingly stole funds using fake loan applications and
*02:29.320- 02:30.260* :  deprived officials.
*02:31.000- 02:35.840* :  Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head is in Bangkok and told me how rare a death sentence
*02:35.840- 02:36.940* :  for a woman is.
*03:05.420- 03:10.980* :  I think hoping to direct public anger and frustration over that very much towards her.
*03:10.980- 03:15.460* :  She's sort of been demonized and held up as this figure.
*03:15.460- 03:20.720* :  And if you look at some of the feedback that we see on BBC websites from Vietnamese readers,
*03:20.720- 03:23.800* :  they're all approved of this death penalty, I think she should get it.
*03:24.120- 03:28.480* :  But of course, there's a very big question that hangs over this case, which is that she was able to
*03:28.480- 03:32.200* :  take, she actually formed this bank with the approval of the state authority.
*03:32.200- 03:33.320* :  She was very involved in it.
*03:33.620- 03:38.120* :  She had hidden but could easily have been found her ownership control of the bank, 90% of the bank
*03:38.120- 03:38.700* :  she controlled.
*03:38.700- 03:43.380* :  And for 11 years, she used that to appoint her own officials, according to prosecutors,
*03:43.380- 03:49.580* :  and direct these, I mean, this sums a staggering $44 billion of loans to her own companies.
*03:49.840- 03:51.000* :  That went on for 11 years.
*03:51.000- 03:55.220* :  And I think were Vietnam a rather freer place in terms of public discussion.
*03:55.220- 03:59.720* :  Many people would be asking how many other people are implicated apart from those on trial today.
*03:59.720- 04:04.740* :  How was a government in so much in control unable to spot this fraud before now?
*04:05.480- 04:10.480* :  There's a lot of talk online about the idea that the death penalty is really being used here as
*04:10.480- 04:14.640* :  a mechanism to try to get some of the money back. Do you buy that?
*04:15.620- 04:19.280* :  Well, it's part of the Vietnamese judicial system of the way that it operates.
*04:19.420- 04:20.580* :  And remember, it's not a free one.
*04:20.580- 04:24.600* :  This was in many ways a completely foregone conclusion, this verdict.
*04:25.140- 04:29.080* :  Part of it is encouraging those who are accused to give back funds.
*04:29.560- 04:32.820* :  We've seen all the other defendants who have been pleading for a leniency,
*04:32.820- 04:37.500* :  all the others admitted their guilt, offering to give back as much money as they could find.
*04:37.500- 04:42.400* :  So it is part of the system that if you give back money, you can get a lower sentence.
*04:42.400- 04:44.240* :  I think they'll be hoping she does that.
*04:44.240- 04:48.460* :  Just remember what the size of the whole in the public finances from this,
*04:48.760- 04:52.480* :  according to the state, $27 billion of the loans she took out,
*04:52.480- 04:55.140* :  are non-recoverable, at least they can't recover them.
*04:55.420- 04:58.740* :  I think they're hoping that she digs around and comes up with more assets.
*04:59.160- 05:03.160* :  Remember, she's a hugely wealthy property owner that will help them cover a hole,
*05:03.160- 05:07.080* :  which is certainly going to damage the public finances as they try to rescue this bank.
*05:07.680- 05:12.960* :  Jonathan Head in Bangkok and 85 others involved in the corruption have received lesser sentences,
*05:13.420- 05:15.620* :  including four who were given life in prison.
*05:16.620- 05:21.800* :  A Russian bombardment may have completely destroyed a key Ukrainian power plant outside Kiev,
*05:21.800- 05:26.600* :  as power facilities were targeted across five regions in the early hours of this morning.
*05:27.260- 05:31.300* :  According to government data, nearly a third of the Russian drones and missiles were not
*05:31.300- 05:35.740* :  shot down. Our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainesford reports from Ukraine.
*05:36.800- 05:41.040* :  Russia is deliberately and systematically targeting Ukraine's energy system,
*05:41.460- 05:46.400* :  and this was another massive attack. In the early hours of morning, more than 80 missiles and
*05:46.400- 05:51.460* :  drones targeted sites right across the country, and almost the third made it through Ukraine's air
*05:51.460- 05:56.340* :  defenses. In the northeast, Harkiv's power plants suffered major damage in late March,
*05:56.340- 06:01.380* :  and the region has now been hard hit again. The mayor there describes the situation as
*06:01.380- 06:05.660* :  very difficult, announcing even more blackouts for households and businesses.
*06:06.400- 06:11.500* :  The Metro has stopped running to save power. It's operating now only as a shelter from incoming
*06:11.500- 06:17.320* :  missiles. President Zelensky has condemned what he called a heinous attack, and he's called once
*06:17.320- 06:22.680* :  again for more air defense systems from Western Allies. The Russian strikes are now far more
*06:22.680- 06:28.400* :  accurate and more devastating, and Ukraine is struggling to cope. In the west of the country,
*06:28.400- 06:33.520* :  at least two more thermal power plants suffered significant damage overnight, facing even more
*06:33.520- 06:39.660* :  strain on electricity supply nationwide. The DTEC power company was already down to 20 percent
*06:39.660- 06:46.780* :  capacity after repeated attacks. The situation now is even worse. In Russian occupied Ukraine,
*06:46.780- 06:51.460* :  the stability of the Zaporizhya nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, is in question
*06:51.880- 06:55.880* :  after strikes on Sunday, for which both sides have refused to take the blame.
*06:56.500- 07:01.540* :  The Board of Governors at the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, is due to hold an emergency
*07:01.540- 07:05.480* :  meeting. Its director general is Rafael Mariano Grossi.
*07:06.120- 07:12.580* :  Any attack aiming a nuclear power plant is unacceptable. This irresponsible is reckless.
*07:12.960- 07:18.380* :  One of the reactors is operating at a very, very low, low regime, low level, to produce some
*07:18.380- 07:25.920* :  steam. But still, we have tons of nuclear material around. Within the reactors, outside the reactors,
*07:25.920- 07:34.140* :  I spent fuel storage facilities. So, I would not go along with this notion that, you know,
*07:34.140- 07:37.940* :  it's not so serious. Let's not be worried. This is extremely worrying.
*07:38.980- 07:44.080* :  South Korea's Prime Minister, Han Doxu, has offered his resignation after his right-wing party,
*07:44.080- 07:48.060* :  the People Power Party, suffered a crushing defeat in parliamentary elections.
*07:48.160- 07:53.520* :  This result allows their rivals, the Democratic Party, to fast-track bills and block the
*07:53.520- 07:56.860* :  agenda of the Conservative President. Jeanne McKenzie is in Seoul.
*07:57.520- 08:02.340* :  This is a landslide victory for the opposition parties here in South Korea. Yes, they want a
*08:02.420- 08:07.200* :  similar number of seats in the last general election back in 2020. But the circumstances
*08:07.200- 08:12.080* :  were very different. There was a hugely popular liberal president in office at the time.
*08:12.660- 08:17.400* :  And so, this defeat for the ruling party is being seen as a vote of no confidence in the current
*08:17.400- 08:22.380* :  president, Yoon Sung-yul, who's been in office for two years. It does weaken his authority,
*08:22.380- 08:27.200* :  even though it might seem on paper that not much has changed when you look at the seats.
*08:27.720- 08:31.840* :  When it comes to the day-to-day politics, it means that the president is going to struggle to
*08:31.840- 08:36.900* :  pass votes and push forward with his agenda. Because the opposition parties are going to be able
*08:36.900- 08:41.520* :  to team up to fast-track the laws they like and block the laws they don't. And so,
*08:41.520- 08:45.560* :  it is going to be more difficult for the government to tackle some of the urgent issues
*08:45.560- 08:51.580* :  that South Korea faces from rising food prices, a slowing economy, a rapidly aging society.
*08:52.300- 08:56.520* :  When it comes to foreign policy, the parliament has less say. And so, we might see the president
*08:56.520- 09:01.900* :  focus more on this as he has done over the past two years. He has made some pretty radical
*09:01.900- 09:06.160* :  changes to foreign policy in his time. He has taken a tough stance on North Korea.
*09:06.160- 09:10.740* :  He's built up his relationship with the United States and Japan in order to counter North Korea
*09:10.740- 09:16.000* :  and China. But crucially, he had the authority to do so because he had just won the presidential
*09:16.000- 09:21.440* :  election. Now he has an effect lost an election. That is going to weaken his leadership.
*09:21.940- 09:25.780* :  He will give him less cloud to broad, and it will make it more difficult for him to push
*09:25.780- 09:29.560* :  ahead with foreign policy that doesn't have popular support here in South Korea.
*09:30.440- 09:31.780* :  Jean Mackenzie in Seoul.
*09:32.380- 09:37.920* :  Several viral and frightening incidents of gun violence and other attacks on the New York subway
*09:37.920- 09:42.920* :  system have raised questions about commuter safety on one of the busiest transport systems
*09:42.920- 09:48.500* :  in the world. About 3 million people ride the subway each day. And while the data shows the
*09:48.500- 09:53.140* :  chance of falling victim to a violent crime is slim, the public is wary. In response,
*09:53.140- 09:58.400* :  the authorities have stepped up security measures. Our correspondent in New York is Netatorfic.
*10:03.680- 10:08.500* :  The moment of sheer panic as gunshots are fired on a New York City subway carriage,
*10:09.020- 10:12.640* :  and desperate riders are finally able to flee the confined car.
*10:15.420- 10:21.080* :  This was just one of a series of random frightening incidents that have gone viral in recent months.
*10:24.900- 10:31.000* :  In this video, musician Ian Forrest was playing in Harold Square in February when he was attacked
*10:31.000- 10:36.180* :  for the second time in less than a year. It's kind of in the middle of the song. I just fell
*10:36.180- 10:40.780* :  all the sudden abruptly. It was a cute pain on the back of my head and I saw my bottle rolling
*10:40.780- 10:44.660* :  around on the ground that I realized, oh my god someone just smacked the back of my head with
*10:44.840- 10:48.960* :  my metal water bottle. I talked to so many other musicians who came up to me afterwards saying,
*10:49.420- 10:53.220* :  I've experienced something similar. I've been harassed. I've been attacked. I've been wronged.
*10:57.160- 11:02.540* :  The subway is the lifeblood of New York, and with budget strained, officials are eager to
*11:02.540- 11:08.840* :  calm fears to get riders to return post-pandemic. New York's governor Kathy Hocal has deployed
*11:08.840- 11:14.920* :  1,000 part-time soldiers of the National Guard and police into the underground network,
*11:15.620- 11:21.640* :  all while insisting that transit is safe. Rambling off statistics saying things are getting
*11:21.640- 11:26.020* :  better doesn't make you feel better, especially when you've just heard about someone being slashed
*11:26.020- 11:33.700* :  in the throat or thrown on to a subway tracks. The increased presence of National Guard and
*11:33.700- 11:39.020* :  police officers of the subway's entrances has been noticeable even if they aren't at every station.
*11:39.620- 11:44.940* :  Now when you look at the data, it doesn't suggest that there's a safety epidemic on the subways.
*11:45.500- 11:50.400* :  Nevertheless, when you speak to New Yorkers, they're mixed on whether or not things are really
*11:50.400- 11:56.200* :  getting worse and if the National Guard is necessary. It's a threat to have hostile, violent people
*11:57.220- 12:03.040* :  that attack and unprovoked manners for no reason. Do you feel unsafe for the subway? No,
*12:03.040- 12:09.320* :  everybody. No, I ain't ever scared. Now instead of attacking, we're going to grab the arm
*12:09.960- 12:15.560* :  and hold it. Enrollment for self-defense classes are on the rise at this martial art studio
*12:15.560- 12:23.560* :  Krav Maga experts. Zahi Shamesh is the owner. Everybody knows someone that's been attacked or harassed
*12:23.740- 12:28.300* :  or it's on the news a lot. So I think it just gave people spaces a lot more.
*12:31.120- 12:36.280* :  Zahi and others here, such as student Lucy Baker, believe that putting a stop to subway crime
*12:36.280- 12:43.200* :  also involves investing in poverty reduction and mental health. In fact, an official survey by
*12:43.200- 12:48.920* :  the Metropolitan Transit Authority found commuters were far more concerned about people behaving
*12:48.920- 12:54.320* :  erratically than a more visible police presence. There's definitely like a mental health
*12:54.320- 12:58.920* :  crisis like drug problems in the city. We've put like so much money into like the police force,
*12:58.960- 13:02.780* :  but like what are we putting to like prevent these people from getting on to the streets and stuff.
*13:05.300- 13:10.340* :  Ian doesn't plan on performing in this subway for the time being. Instead, the medical student
*13:10.340- 13:16.540* :  has taken his music above ground at Mount Sinai Hospital where he can safely share his talent.
*13:17.200- 13:21.060* :  It was you know my outlet, my creative outlet to perform in the subway. So to have that all,
*13:21.060- 13:24.880* :  you know, taken away in an instant, it's absolutely heart-wrenching.
*13:29.280- 13:31.980* :  Our correspondent Nettaurfik reporting from New York.
*13:33.700- 13:37.700* :  Start to come on this podcast. The death has been announced in Japan at the first foreign
*13:37.700- 13:45.660* :  born Sumo Grand Champion and new excavations in Pompeii. We're looking into a three-sided room.
*13:45.860- 13:51.160* :  Its floor is covered with these black mosaic. So you can imagine that when it's really clean.
*13:51.160- 13:52.760* :  The colors would have been amazing.
*14:00.660- 14:05.600* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the country is continuing its war in Gaza,
*14:06.000- 14:11.220* :  but also preparing for scenarios in other areas. His comments came amid concern that Iran
*14:11.220- 14:16.140* :  is said to be planning an imminent attack in retaliation for the killing of senior members of
*14:16.140- 14:22.040* :  the Revolutionary Guard in Syria last week. President Biden assured Israel the U.S. is ready to
*14:22.040- 14:28.140* :  protect it. There's threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel. As I told Prime Minister Netanyahu,
*14:29.140- 14:35.160* :  our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is iron clad.
*14:35.160- 14:39.620* :  Let me say it again, iron clad. We're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security.
*14:40.300- 14:45.560* :  An American general is in Israel to talk about Washington's fears. One official is quoted as saying
*14:45.560- 14:51.280* :  it's a matter of when, not if. I've been speaking to our State Department correspondent, Tom Bateman.
*14:51.940- 14:56.480* :  It's certainly the messaging from U.S. officials in Washington that they think there is a credible
*14:56.480- 15:03.200* :  threat of an Iranian strike onto Israeli soil among a range of possibilities that they think the
*15:03.200- 15:08.900* :  Iranians are looking at. Remember the starting point of this particular episode, as you mentioned,
*15:09.020- 15:17.840* :  was the strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. We had the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Amanai saying
*15:17.840- 15:24.920* :  yesterday that he regarded that as an attack on Iranian soil and that Israel would be punished
*15:25.700- 15:30.460* :  for this and then increasingly threatening rhetoric from both sides and about how the Israelis
*15:30.460- 15:36.720* :  would respond to that. I thought it was striking that President Biden himself said that Iran is
*15:36.760- 15:43.060* :  threatening a significant attack on Israel. I think a note of caution is to say that by very
*15:43.060- 15:48.460* :  publicly putting it out there, I think in Washington, this is part of an attempt to try to get the
*15:48.460- 15:54.760* :  Iranians to stand down or to preemptively deescalate whatever they might be thinking about.
*15:54.760- 15:58.160* :  Certainly, there was an urgent diplomacy with messages being passed from the Americans
*15:58.160- 16:05.400* :  via Arab countries to the Iranians to try to lower the temperature in the region. But I do think,
*16:05.400- 16:11.240* :  as far as the Americans are concerned, their big fear had always been of a regional conflagration
*16:12.020- 16:18.580* :  around the Gaza war. My sense is they think this is as close as it has ever been in the last six
*16:18.580- 16:24.340* :  months. Are we getting rapidly changing language from Joe Biden about Israel this week? Only
*16:24.340- 16:30.520* :  yesterday he was talking about Israel's conducting Gaza being a mistake. Now his support for Israel
*16:30.620- 16:36.720* :  is iron clad. Well, that's an important point here because, and I think also it plays into why
*16:36.720- 16:41.900* :  the message is pretty public and quite loud from the Americans about that iron clad support,
*16:41.900- 16:50.140* :  as you mentioned, because the administration is very aware that there is a very significant
*16:50.140- 16:56.960* :  rift between it and the Israelis over Israel's conduct in Gaza. They know that Israel's adversaries
*16:56.960- 17:01.620* :  are aware of the strains on that relationship. And I think this is an attempt, you know,
*17:02.080- 17:06.240* :  from President Biden downwards to say, okay, you know, if there are differences over Gaza,
*17:06.240- 17:11.640* :  there are not differences over the Iranian threat and the threat from Iran's allies in the region.
*17:11.640- 17:16.820* :  So I think, again, that's why they're trying to sort of signal the message that, as they call it,
*17:16.820- 17:21.460* :  iron clad support very publicly at the moment. I'll state the apartment correspondent, Tom Bateman.
*17:22.020- 17:26.360* :  Here on the global news podcast, we've been talking about Arizona's decision to introduce a near
*17:26.360- 17:33.140* :  total ban on abortion, the 15th US state to do so. In Poland, things are going in the opposite
*17:33.720- 17:38.840* :  direction, as parliament considers liberalizing the country's strict abortion laws. Currently,
*17:38.840- 17:43.240* :  terminations are only allowed when the pregnancy endangers the mother's health or when it's a
*17:43.240- 17:48.480* :  result of rape or incest. This proposition would give women access to abortion on demand,
*17:48.480- 17:54.100* :  up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, a right which Polish women haven't had for more than 30 years.
*17:54.100- 17:59.480* :  From Warsaw, here's our correspondent Adam Eastern. It's the start of the debate in parliament.
*17:59.480- 18:06.660* :  It's very significant. Poland's pro-EU Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power pledging to offer
*18:07.020- 18:13.840* :  greater access to abortion. And many, many opinion polls over the years are showing a trend
*18:14.060- 18:20.700* :  that more and more people in Poland are supporting greater access to abortion in this very Roman
*18:20.700- 18:26.660* :  Catholic country where it's one of the most strict laws in the EU currently. But the politicians
*18:26.660- 18:33.720* :  up to this point have been reluctant to act. In fact, the previous right-wing law and justice
*18:33.720- 18:40.360* :  government presided over heightened restrictions to the abortion law backed by the Roman Catholic
*18:40.360- 18:48.000* :  Church and that triggered massive street protests right across the country during the height of
*18:48.000- 18:55.400* :  the COVID pandemic restrictions. It's not going to be easy for the Polish parliament to actually push
*18:55.400- 19:01.500* :  through a liberalization of the law because Donald Tusk presides over a coalition government from
*19:01.500- 19:08.940* :  the left centrist to agrarian conservatives. And even they don't agree on how far this liberalization
*19:08.940- 19:14.860* :  should go. And in fact, there are competing proposals presented by those different coalition members.
*19:15.320- 19:19.640* :  On the other side of the political aisle, the opposition right-wing opposition law and justice,
*19:19.640- 19:26.700* :  another small party, they oppose liberalization. And ultimately, the country's Catholic Church
*19:26.700- 19:33.580* :  going President Anjay Dutta also has the power to veto any legislation that parliament
*19:33.580- 19:40.020* :  approves and it's quite likely that he would do so. Julian Assange might not face prosecution in
*19:40.020- 19:46.380* :  the United States after an Australian request for him to be returned home. The founder of WikiLeaks
*19:46.380- 19:53.460* :  published a huge trove of US military files in 2010 and 2011 and is being pursued for espionage.
*19:53.740- 19:58.740* :  Joe Biden has suggested though it might be called off. Stella Assange, the wife of Julian Assange,
*19:58.740- 20:05.160* :  has been talking to my colleague Johnny Diamond. I think it's a good sign. The Prime Minister of
*20:05.160- 20:11.020* :  Australia said that he is optimistic. So it looks like things could be moving in the right direction
*20:11.020- 20:16.360* :  and obviously after not just five years in Belmars High Security Prison but 14 years since he
*20:16.360- 20:21.300* :  effectively lost his freedom right after publishing this trove, then lots of people around the world
*20:21.680- 20:26.800* :  have been saying for years that this case should be dropped. The comment and the suggestion that
*20:26.800- 20:31.780* :  the hunt for your husband may be called off comes at an interesting time, doesn't it? Because the UK
*20:32.300- 20:38.660* :  who are pondering the extradition request are waiting for an assurance from the US authorities
*20:38.660- 20:45.640* :  that the death penalty wouldn't be used. Yes, that's right. The High Court gave Julian a kind of
*20:45.640- 20:52.100* :  conditional leave to appeal and asked the US for so-called assurances in relation to the death
*20:52.140- 20:58.520* :  penalty and also in relation to the First Amendment protections because they identified that he
*20:58.620- 21:04.940* :  is being charged for publishing these documents which evidence to work crimes and that the
*21:04.940- 21:10.720* :  United States itself in its arguments has said that he may not be able to use the constitutional
*21:10.720- 21:15.900* :  protections on press freedom because he's an Australian citizen. The critics of your husband
*21:15.900- 21:24.280* :  attack the way that he published the material. They say it jeopardized lives. We categorically
*21:24.380- 21:31.520* :  and he claimed that he did not publish responsibly. He published and took every measure of care
*21:31.520- 21:37.460* :  under oath the United States has had to admit that they have seen no evidence of any person coming to
*21:37.460- 21:42.300* :  physical harm as a result of these publications. What we do know is that these publications revealed
*21:42.300- 21:49.000* :  this physical destruction and death of tens of thousands. But I must say this is a prosecution
*21:49.000- 21:54.900* :  that is from the Trump era. It's a Trump legacy and really Joe Biden should have dropped it from
*21:54.900- 22:01.500* :  day one. His predecessor Obama decided not to pursue this prosecution. They said that it would
*22:01.500- 22:05.840* :  set a precedent that could be used against the rest of the press because it criminalizes
*22:05.840- 22:12.220* :  journalistic activity. Stella Assange talking to Johnny Diamond. The death has been announced in
*22:12.220- 22:18.900* :  Japan of the first foreign-born Sumo grand champion. Akebono, who is 54, suffered heart failure
*22:18.900- 22:23.840* :  earlier this month. Winning 11 championships, he paved the way for many other foreign-born
*22:23.840- 22:28.820* :  wrestlers and broke down cultural barriers in this traditional sport, eventually becoming a
*22:28.820- 22:35.720* :  Japanese citizen. After retiring in 2001, Akebono also enjoyed further success in pro-wrestling and
*22:35.720- 22:42.160* :  mixed martial arts. His atokyo correspondent Shima Halil. Akebono was a towering figure in
*22:42.160- 22:48.240* :  Grand Sumo. The 11-time champion helped fuel a Sumo boom in the 1990s attracting millions of
*22:48.240- 22:53.340* :  viewers. At over two meters tall and weighing more than 200 kilograms, he was famous for his
*22:53.340- 22:58.880* :  fighting style and thrusting his opponents out of the ring. Akebono, born Chad Rowan in Hawaii,
*22:58.880- 23:04.980* :  was Grand Sumo's first ever foreign-born Yokosuna, the highest rank any wrestler can attain in the sport.
*23:05.600- 23:11.700* :  In 1996, he became a Japanese citizen and took the name Taro Akebono. Fellow Sumo champion Masaru
*23:11.700- 23:17.800* :  Hanada described him as a rival, a friend, and a person full of love. The US ambassador to Japan
*23:17.800- 23:22.920* :  Rami Manuel said the former champion opened the door for other foreign wrestlers to find success in
*23:22.920- 23:27.680* :  Sumo, adding that he was a proud Hawaiian and a bridge between the US and Japan.
*23:28.660- 23:33.240* :  The excavation of a previously undiscovered part of Pompeii has revealed a sumptuous
*23:33.240- 23:38.180* :  filler with floor to ceiling frescoes and stunning mosaic floors beneath volcanic debris.
*23:38.800- 23:43.320* :  Archaeologists believe a rich, influential man who may have run for public office lived there.
*23:43.640- 23:48.080* :  They also think he may have been the owner of a bakery next door where slaves were probably
*23:48.080- 23:53.080* :  kept him what was virtually a prison. Our science editor Rebecca Morel is in Pompeii.
*23:54.960- 23:59.940* :  I've come to Pompeii. You can see Mount Vesuvius looming over this Roman city, which of course
*23:59.940- 24:07.500* :  was buried by an eruption here two thousand years ago. Now the biggest excavation in a generation
*24:07.520- 24:12.220* :  is taking place and it's really giving us a new glimpse at this city which has been frozen
*24:12.220- 24:18.160* :  in time for so long and there are so many extraordinary new finds here. Now I'm joined by Sophie Hey,
*24:18.180- 24:24.140* :  an archaeologist at Pompeii. You're going to show me some of the amazing rooms which have been found.
*24:25.340- 24:28.900* :  You're sort of looking down aren't you? We're standing, we're standing at a ground level,
*24:28.900- 24:36.080* :  but we're still on top of all of Vesuvian eruption material and at least three four meters below us
*24:36.260- 24:42.620* :  we're at Roman ground level and at the moment we're looking into a three-sided room which would have
*24:42.620- 24:48.780* :  once looked out through a sort of collinated portico into a garden area and this big room is
*24:48.780- 24:56.700* :  absolutely stunning. Its floor is covered with these black mosaic with little insets of colored marble
*24:56.980- 25:00.340* :  so you can imagine that when it's really clean the colors would have been amazing.
*25:00.840- 25:05.140* :  I'm going to go down a bit further into the excavation. Yeah, let's head over.
*25:09.920- 25:16.360* :  We're in a courtyard now, interior courtyard. Yes, so this is a courtyard within a house which is
*25:16.360- 25:22.200* :  very common in the Roman period. They do inside and outside simultaneously and the view I have to
*25:22.200- 25:27.780* :  say is so dramatic. In front of us at the far side of this courtyard we have an opening which they
*25:27.780- 25:36.020* :  haven't yet excavated but sort of splurging out in a sort of torrent is this three meter high pile
*25:36.220- 25:43.000* :  of lapilli which is the little pymistones that rain down on Pompeii for 18 hours. It's kind of
*25:43.000- 25:50.300* :  surging through an open doorway and on the top we have the layers of the pyroclastic flow which
*25:50.740- 25:56.440* :  sealed Pompeii for good and if you were still in the city then you were dead. I mean this is basically
*25:56.440- 26:02.900* :  the avalanche of gas and volcanic material which would move very quickly across the town.
*26:03.080- 26:06.320* :  We're going to head down a bit more because we're kind of heading from the opulent this grand
*26:06.320- 26:15.320* :  residence into a commercial area. So hopefully we're being quite careful about where we're
*26:15.620- 26:21.960* :  treading but here we've come into a bakery. It's here where we get a glimpse into the sort of
*26:21.960- 26:27.020* :  darker side of Roman life. Working in a bakery is not about the nice smell of freshly baked bread
*26:27.020- 26:33.220* :  at all. For the slaves that work here they're working pretty much 24 hours a day. It's not an easy
*26:33.220- 26:39.540* :  life. The air would be thick with the dust of flour. Breathing would be an issue of course it
*26:39.540- 26:45.740* :  gets very hot so that would be not nice. The slaves who work here have to live in a small room
*26:45.800- 26:53.040* :  and they found bars on the skylight to stop them escaping. So we've kind of described it as a
*26:53.040- 26:58.540* :  prison bakery. People who are working here are held captive here until somebody lets them out.
*27:00.600- 27:04.720* :  It's always sort of tugs at the heartstrings a little bit to find people and understand their
*27:04.740- 27:10.140* :  story and do them justice and I think that's our job as archaeologist is to obviously treat them
*27:10.140- 27:15.760* :  with respect but do their story justice. Dr Sophie Haye with Rebecca Morrell in Pompeii.
