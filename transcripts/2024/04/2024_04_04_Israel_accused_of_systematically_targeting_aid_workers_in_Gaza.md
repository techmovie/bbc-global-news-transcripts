*01:35.580- 01:40.400* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and the early hours of Thursday the 4th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:40.960- 01:45.360* :  After the deaths of aid agency workers in an Israeli military strike in Gaza,
*01:45.780- 01:48.540* :  is this a turning point for Israel's allies.
*01:49.320- 01:55.260* :  More than 100 people are missing in road tunnels and quarries following a powerful earthquake in Taiwan.
*01:55.260- 02:00.440* :  We're here for the worst affected area. Even as I'm standing here, we can feel every now and
*02:00.440- 02:04.140* :  again the ground begin to move beneath us. The buildings begin to shake slightly.
*02:04.140- 02:08.040* :  There are aftershocks, so there is a concern that there could be continued damage.
*02:08.600- 02:14.920* :  NATO looks at ways to provide long-term military support for Ukraine's fight against Russia in the
*02:14.920- 02:18.440* :  absence of billions of stalled funds from the US.
*02:20.780- 02:25.460* :  Also in this podcast, questions over trophy hunting come to the fore yet again.
*02:25.880- 02:31.340* :  These import bans that have been discussed by Germany and other western countries are largely
*02:31.340- 02:36.060* :  misguided because trophy hunting is not a threat to a single species.
*02:36.700- 02:43.440* :  And why dead politicians are appearing on the campaign trail for India's upcoming general election.
*02:46.540- 02:50.960* :  The government in Jerusalem has now acknowledged the killing of seven aid workers in Israeli
*02:50.960- 02:56.740* :  air strikes in Gaza was a tragic error. As spokesman said, an investigation found they'd been
*02:56.740- 03:02.840* :  targeted because of what he called misidentification. The founder of World Central Kitchen,
*03:02.840- 03:09.880* :  the chef Jose Andres, has accused Israeli forces of deliberately targeting the aid organization's
*03:09.880- 03:14.760* :  vehicles. Six of the aid workers were international, three of whom were British.
*03:15.460- 03:20.500* :  The UK's Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Israel had to ensure the safety of aid workers
*03:20.920- 03:23.740* :  and that enough aid is getting into Gaza.
*03:39.420- 03:45.500* :  Welcome the fact that he spoke about much more aid getting into Gaza up to 500 trucks a day.
*03:45.500- 03:50.660* :  That is essential. But of course the extra aid won't work unless there is proper
*03:50.660- 03:57.260* :  deconfliction, unless aid can be taken around Gaza and we avoid the dreadful incidents like we've
*03:57.260- 04:02.140* :  seen in the last couple of days. That is vital and Britain will be watching very closely to make
*04:02.140- 04:07.380* :  sure that that happens. There are fears that Israel is making it almost impossible for the aid
*04:07.380- 04:13.720* :  agencies to operate in Gaza and more agencies could be forced to pull out. World Central Kitchen
*04:13.720- 04:17.980* :  has already done that. Our correspondent Yuga Bachega reports from Jerusalem.
*04:18.780- 04:24.040* :  In a rare demission of fault, Israel's military said the initial findings of an investigation
*04:24.040- 04:29.220* :  suggested the strike had been a mistake carried out after a misidentification.
*04:30.040- 04:32.860* :  Avi Haiman is a spokesman for the Israeli government.
*04:33.200- 04:37.260* :  There is an investigation which will be made public and we will come out in the coming day's
*04:37.260- 04:42.580* :  preliminary findings show that it was a tragic, tragic mistake and my heart goes out to the
*04:42.580- 04:47.720* :  families involved, to the families of the victims. What I'll say is that it has happened in the
*04:47.720- 04:54.340* :  past that Hamas and other terrorist organizations have used ambulances to transport their people.
*04:54.740- 05:00.220* :  We still don't have official details about the misidentification or how this strike was approved
*05:00.220- 05:06.480* :  to go ahead. The convoy hit was clearly marked with the world's central kitchen logo and its
*05:06.480- 05:11.820* :  movements had been coordinated with the Israeli military precisely to prevent something like what
*05:11.820- 05:17.760* :  happened. Israel was already facing growing international anger over a conflict that
*05:17.760- 05:24.680* :  skilled nearly 33,000 Palestinians according to the Hamas health ministry. Charities and some of
*05:24.680- 05:30.060* :  Israel's key partners have accused the country of not doing enough to protect civilians and
*05:30.060- 05:36.440* :  of intentionally slowing down the entry and delivery of basic supplies weaponizing aid claims
*05:36.440- 05:41.120* :  Israel denies. Nate Muk is the former head of world central kitchen.
*05:41.820- 05:47.040* :  Haman was already declared or nearly declared in northern Gaza by the United Nations.
*05:47.180- 05:51.800* :  The United Nations, the world food program has been unable to access these areas. This is a
*05:51.800- 05:57.140* :  tragedy, not just for the aid community, not just for the families of those we've lost,
*05:57.140- 06:01.900* :  but this is a tragedy for the people of Gaza and really for the world.
*06:02.620- 06:07.520* :  This incident has highlighted the difficult circumstances in which humanitarian workers
*06:07.880- 06:13.500* :  are having to operate in Gaza. Israel has now promised to improve coordination with those groups,
*06:14.300- 06:19.660* :  but the strong condemnation from some of its closest allies is an indication that patience
*06:19.660- 06:26.260* :  could be running out. In Israel there's increasing pressure on the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*06:26.760- 06:32.200* :  Since the strike, Mr Netanyahu's closest allies in the west have been united in their vocal
*06:32.200- 06:38.960* :  criticism. So diplomatically could this be a turning point in Israel's relations with its allies?
*06:38.960- 06:45.440* :  Is our security correspondent Frank Gardler? Israel is more isolated than ever before.
*06:45.440- 06:52.060* :  Its closest allies, Britain and the US, are unanimous in condemning it. Very strong
*06:52.060- 06:56.980* :  words from the White House talking about outrage. Condemnation from the UN Secretary-General
*06:56.980- 07:01.960* :  Antonio Guterres in Britain for the first time in 12 years, you've got the Israeli ambassador
*07:01.960- 07:06.540* :  being summoned to the foreign office for addressing down. Is this actually going to change the
*07:06.540- 07:10.500* :  conduct of the course of the war? Well, that's up to the Israelis. The only thing that would change
*07:10.500- 07:15.820* :  it in terms of US action is if they cut off the supply of arms, and that doesn't look like it's
*07:15.820- 07:22.900* :  going to happen. But there are increasing calls for Britain to review whether or not this is
*07:23.240- 07:28.660* :  Israel is breaking the law of armed conflict, the rules of war. If it is then Britain,
*07:28.660- 07:35.680* :  would itself be breaking its own rules by supplying components to things like drones and F-35s,
*07:35.720- 07:40.740* :  which are manufactured in the UK? There are two big effects to what's happened here. One is
*07:40.740- 07:46.540* :  diplomatic, and of course the second is humanitarian. It's not only a tragedy to the seven people who
*07:46.540- 07:53.260* :  lost their lives, plus the rest of the 196 humanitarian aid workers and all the 32,000 Palestinians,
*07:53.260- 08:00.180* :  but all that aid that had arrived by ship has got back to Cyprus. So apart from the 100
*08:00.180- 08:05.700* :  tons that was offloaded, all the rest has had to go back because World Central Kitchen, they were
*08:05.700- 08:10.660* :  the ones who were actually getting this stuff ashore, and now they've had to suspend operations.
*08:10.660- 08:16.840* :  So it's a tragedy on many levels. Frank Gardner, now let's return to another story we covered in our
*08:16.840- 08:24.220* :  earlier Global News Podcast, the magnitude 7.4 earthquake which hit Taiwan's eastern coast early
*08:33.600- 08:37.940* :  on Wednesday morning. So far at least nine people are confirmed dead and more than a thousand have
*08:37.940- 08:44.520* :  been injured. The focus now is on rescuing those who are trapped, following the largest quake to
*08:44.520- 08:50.500* :  hit Taiwan in decades. The strength of the tremors took many Taiwanese by surprise, like this young
*08:50.500- 08:57.340* :  filmmaker. I was making my coffee when everything starts shaking and rattling. It was really, really
*08:57.340- 09:03.620* :  scary. I was holding on to my routine trying to steady myself because everything else was falling off
*09:03.620- 09:09.500* :  my glassware and late, and I could hear people screaming inside my head and was like, what to do,
*09:09.500- 09:16.600* :  what to do? I got more from a porter Jan Kamenzen Brumby who's in Hualen City, the epicenter of the
*09:17.600- 09:21.500* :  the quake. The search in Hualen is ongoing for people who are trapped here as a result of his
*09:21.500- 09:26.580* :  earthquake, the largest earthquake in the last 25 years that Taiwan has seen. A lot of people
*09:26.580- 09:31.900* :  affected especially in Hualen City and in Hualen County. I'm standing looking at a large building
*09:31.900- 09:35.880* :  that's slumped over and we're speaking earlier to an engineer who was saying that they had been
*09:35.880- 09:39.940* :  undergoing a large effort to try and rescue the last people who have been trapped in there. That
*09:39.940- 09:44.720* :  last person now has been thankfully saved and is undergoing treatment in a local hospital.
*09:45.280- 09:49.140* :  Not everyone was so lucky. However, we spoke to one person who was standing outside of the
*09:49.500- 09:53.520* :  ruined walls of his own house that had been destroyed by the earthquake. He said that one of the people
*09:53.520- 09:58.920* :  who used to frequent his bar had passed away. They lived in that building that had slumped down
*09:58.920- 10:04.820* :  in Hualen. There are lots of people. Also, we think still trapped in the mountains around Hualen.
*10:05.260- 10:09.580* :  It's a very touristy place. It's known for its mountains. People take their time cycling and
*10:09.580- 10:14.320* :  driving up through the mountain passes through tunnels and lots of those tunnels have become
*10:14.320- 10:18.700* :  obstructed as a result of the large landslides that we saw earlier today because of this earthquake
*10:18.700- 10:24.260* :  and the aftershocks that are followed. Describe more to us about how the landscape and the
*10:24.260- 10:28.680* :  infrastructure has been affected. Well, I will say one thing. Taiwan has done a considerably
*10:28.680- 10:34.660* :  better job at this time than it did 25 years ago. The rules, regulations and the infrastructure
*10:34.660- 10:39.260* :  changes that were put in place after that deadly earthquake. The left thousands dead in 1999
*10:39.340- 10:43.560* :  have clearly had some kind of an impact. In Hualen, where I'm standing, we spoke to a local
*10:43.560- 10:47.340* :  county official who said that there are 18 large buildings over undergone significant
*10:47.340- 10:52.900* :  serious damage. The 18 pales in comparison to the number that we saw in 1999. The last time
*10:53.200- 10:57.760* :  we had an earthquake that was this size. One issue though, people here are supposed to get
*10:58.300- 11:01.660* :  earthquake warnings on their phones when there are significant earthquakes. That was one of the
*11:01.660- 11:05.720* :  warning systems that was put in place. That didn't happen. And there are some people asking why
*11:05.720- 11:10.320* :  when there was an earthquake this size, they weren't warned about it earlier. And is there a lot of
*11:10.320- 11:15.660* :  concern that more tremors might be on the way? Well, the Japanese meteorological agency earlier
*11:15.660- 11:20.400* :  today said that we can expect more tremors. Even as I'm standing here, we can feel every now and
*11:20.400- 11:25.060* :  again the ground begin to move beneath us. The buildings begin to shake slightly. There are
*11:25.060- 11:29.580* :  aftershocks. These are common often when you have large earthquakes. So there is a concern that
*11:29.580- 11:34.540* :  there could be continued damage. But that being said, the military has been drafted in to help here.
*11:34.540- 11:39.780* :  The firefighters are working in full force to demolish buildings that look unsafe and to ensure
*11:39.780- 11:43.960* :  that no further people get injured. Jan Kamenzen Brumpi in Taiwan
*11:44.980- 11:49.740* :  NATO foreign ministers have been discussing plans to provide long-term military support for
*11:49.740- 11:55.660* :  Ukraine to continue its fight with invading Russian forces. The Secretary General Jan Stoltenberg
*11:55.960- 12:01.480* :  said no decisions had yet been taken, but the military alliance had started planning a greater
*12:01.480- 12:08.340* :  role in providing finance, training and security for Kiev. A massive $60 billion of proposed
*12:08.340- 12:13.680* :  additional funding for Ukraine in the U.S. remains blocked in Congress by Republicans.
*12:14.420- 12:17.240* :  From Brussels, here's our defense correspondent Jonathan Beal.
*12:17.880- 12:23.300* :  Jan Stoltenberg said Ukraine needed urgent help and delays in providing military support
*12:23.300- 12:28.820* :  were already having consequences on the battlefield. Russia's pressing its current advantage
*12:28.820- 12:34.960* :  of greater manpower and supplies of ammunition. NATO's Secretary General is not just worried about
*12:34.960- 12:40.680* :  the present, but also the longer term. He's put forward proposals to secure military support
*12:40.680- 12:47.080* :  for Kiev for the next five years, what some have called a Trump-proof plan should he be elected
*12:47.080- 12:53.280* :  president for a second term. It includes a goal of creating a 100 billion euro defense package
*12:53.280- 12:59.620* :  for Ukraine and NATO taking over the U.S.-led contact group which coordinates military support.
*13:00.420- 13:03.580* :  Mr Stoltenberg said NATO was in it for the long haul.
*13:03.960- 13:08.980* :  The Ukrainians are not running out of courage. They are running out of ammunition.
*13:09.920- 13:14.280* :  We need to step up now and ensure our support is built to last.
*13:15.280- 13:20.560* :  So in our meeting today, we discussed how to put our support on the firmer and more
*13:20.560- 13:27.900* :  enduring basis for the future. All allies agree on the need to support Ukraine in this critical moment.
*13:28.580- 13:33.700* :  Tomorrow, foreign ministers will attend a ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the creation
*13:33.700- 13:40.280* :  of NATO. The alliance has steadily grown from a dozen to 32 members, but still not
*13:40.280- 13:44.720* :  all meet its target of spending 2 percent of their national income on defense.
*13:45.620- 13:50.440* :  The UK has said that should be the goal for all members to mark this milestone.
*13:51.280- 13:57.520* :  Jonathan Bill. In Haiti, where armed gangs have inflicted chaos and unimaginable brutality
*13:57.520- 14:02.480* :  on everyday life in the capital and beyond, as state of emergency was officially due to end on
*14:02.480- 14:08.560* :  Wednesday. But widespread violence persists. Armed gunmen are currently threatening to take control
*14:08.560- 14:13.200* :  of the country's biggest hospital. Tens of thousands of people have fled Porto Prince,
*14:13.200- 14:19.660* :  including aid worker Matt Knight from the humanitarian group Goal. That rule has taken him to some
*14:19.660- 14:25.860* :  of the most dangerous places in the world. And speaking from Cappation, Paul Henley asked
*14:25.860- 14:31.880* :  how his experience in Haiti compared to them. This one was really difficult. I think because
*14:31.880- 14:37.560* :  of the randomness, you just can't predict where it's going to spring up next. And you don't know
*14:37.800- 14:43.200* :  who's going to spring up. So when I worked in Ukraine, it was a very obvious enemy. You
*14:43.360- 14:48.400* :  knew that when the air-raid sirens went off, you had to get down into the air-raid shelters.
*14:49.080- 14:54.640* :  Here, it can happen anytime, any day. And the different gangs don't wear different uniforms.
*14:54.640- 14:58.920* :  So you don't know who is a member of a gang and who's not a member of a gang.
*14:59.240- 15:04.140* :  What are you waiting for to get back into Porto Prince to continue your aid work?
*15:04.760- 15:11.460* :  Goal of still got 79 Haitian nationals who will continue to deliver aid, even though I'm not there.
*15:11.600- 15:16.620* :  And ironically, the area that we work in predominantly is called Carrefour. Normally,
*15:16.620- 15:21.680* :  that would be a relatively dangerous area for our staff to work in. But because the Fittin has
*15:22.220- 15:28.400* :  moved up into Petionville into different areas of Porto Prince, it has actually meant that it's
*15:28.400- 15:33.340* :  been safer for us to get our staff into other areas of the capital.
*15:33.800- 15:39.240* :  Is there any sign that the much anticipated transitional council in Haiti will be put in place
*15:39.240- 15:44.660* :  and the situation will change? No, actually, if anything, that's made things more difficult.
*15:45.120- 15:51.280* :  So yesterday, there were demonstrations organized both in the capital and in Jeremy,
*15:51.280- 15:56.800* :  which is another area that goal working in the regions. Demonstrations were organized because
*15:56.800- 16:02.040* :  people don't feel like the gangs have got voice in the transitional council and the transitional
*16:02.040- 16:07.420* :  council doesn't actually represent the people. So I think in the short term, we're likely to see
*16:07.420- 16:12.060* :  more trouble rather than less because of the arrangements of the transitional council.
*16:12.480- 16:18.960* :  Matt Knight in Haiti. The divisive and emotive issue of trophy hunting in Africa has come to the
*16:18.960- 16:24.580* :  four yet again. After the Environment Minister in Berlin said it was considering tighter restrictions
*16:24.580- 16:30.700* :  on the import of hunting trophies. The President of Botswana responded on Tuesday by threatening to
*16:30.700- 16:36.880* :  send 20,000 elephants to Germany. Meanwhile, the South African government says it'll phase out
*16:36.880- 16:43.480* :  to breeding captive lions for hunting. Our African regional editor Richard Hamilton told me more
*16:43.480- 16:49.460* :  about the different approaches of the two countries. South Africa seems to be agreeing with the
*16:49.500- 16:55.200* :  sensitivities of Western countries and animal rights groups, which are against trophy hunting
*16:55.200- 17:02.920* :  because they say it's cruel, barbaric and outmoded. And South Africa wants to phase it out
*17:02.920- 17:09.220* :  for lions. But on the other hand, Botswana represents the other side of the argument. They say that
*17:09.220- 17:15.660* :  trophy hunting is a vital part of conservation. It helps fund conservation and it helps control
*17:15.660- 17:21.260* :  the elephant population, which is 130,000 in Botswana. And that's why the President
*17:21.340- 17:27.340* :  rather rhetorically threatened to send 20,000 to Germany. But basically that was in response,
*17:27.340- 17:33.460* :  as you say, to Germany threatening to tighten the rules. But it's a nuanced subject and it's not
*17:33.460- 17:39.760* :  just a one-way argument. And Dan Challender is a conservation scientist from Oxford University
*17:39.760- 17:45.320* :  here in Britain. Botswana is ranked first in the world for conserving megafauna, including
*17:46.160- 17:51.760* :  African elephants. So it's got a really successful conservation model and that happens to include
*17:51.760- 17:58.020* :  trophy hunting. These import bans that have been discussed by Germany and a range of other
*17:58.020- 18:04.900* :  Western countries are largely misguided because trophy hunting is not a threat to a single species.
*18:05.180- 18:10.580* :  And so this idea that these import bans would help protect threatened or endangered species is
*18:10.580- 18:16.940* :  essentially unfounded. This is big business, isn't it, in both countries. It's making a lot of
*18:16.940- 18:22.540* :  people a lot of money, isn't it Richard? That's right. And South Africa has depended on trophy
*18:22.540- 18:28.960* :  hunting. It's estimated that every year trophy hunters have been spending around $250 million
*18:29.260- 18:37.440* :  and contributing about $340 million to the economy. They also create 17,000 jobs. It's estimated
*18:37.440- 18:45.220* :  that up to 12,000 lions are kept in captivity in 350 farms in South Africa. And then in Botswana
*18:45.220- 18:52.980* :  for elephants it contributes about $5 million a year and each hunter would pay about 50,000
*18:52.980- 18:58.140* :  for an elephant shoot. So is there any way through this? Is the international community just
*18:58.140- 19:04.320* :  adorns with African nations over this issue? It is a bit to be honest. The game changer was the
*19:04.320- 19:10.540* :  audience may remember in 2015 a famous lion was killed in Zimbabwe called Cecil. There were
*19:10.540- 19:16.640* :  images of an American dentist that paraded the deadline in front of him and that caused a general
*19:16.640- 19:23.120* :  outrage amongst Western countries and that prompted a ban in Zimbabwe and as you say South Africa
*19:23.120- 19:29.280* :  going along with a ban but that there is resentment perhaps in African countries that they're being
*19:29.280- 19:35.900* :  dictated to as to what they should do. So for example, Zimbabwe wanted to sell it stock pot of
*19:35.900- 19:42.400* :  ivory but that's up against Western objections that don't want to encourage poaching. So it's
*19:42.400- 19:48.320* :  a rather complicated issue and it's quite nuanced but trophy hunting has become a bit of a diplomatic
*19:48.320- 19:56.060* :  issue, a bit of a political football. Richard Hamilton still to calm on the global news podcast.
*19:57.140- 20:03.440* :  In 2022 they were virtually nothing and now Timo is getting on for tens of millions of downloads
*20:04.000- 20:14.480* :  as Amazon met its match in the shape of China's Timo. Let's return once again to our main story.
*20:14.480- 20:19.760* :  The founder of World Central Kitchen, Jose Andres, has said Israeli forces in Gaza
*20:20.660- 20:25.380* :  systematically targeted the cars carrying seven of his aid workers who were killed on Monday.
*20:25.940- 20:31.560* :  He also said his charity had clear communication with the Israeli military which knew the movements
*20:31.580- 20:36.600* :  of his staff. The UN's humanitarian coordinator, Jamie McGoldrick,
*20:36.860- 20:42.820* :  done the BBC that Israel's system for allowing aid into Gaza is far too complicated.
*20:43.580- 20:50.020* :  Shaman Friedman is a spokesman for Kogat, the Israeli government agency responsible for coordinating
*20:50.020- 20:56.580* :  aid deliveries into Gaza and he spoke to James Menendez. Kogat or the coordination of government
*20:56.580- 21:01.940* :  activities in the territories. During the war we have led and implemented Israel's humanitarian
*21:01.940- 21:07.340* :  initiatives within the Gaza Strip and as part of that we have established a team that is
*21:07.340- 21:12.040* :  dedicated since day one of the war to understanding the humanitarian situation on the ground.
*21:12.040- 21:15.940* :  They build their assessment based on conversations that they have with different international
*21:15.940- 21:20.480* :  organizations, people that we speak to on the ground to understand to facilitate humanitarian aid
*21:20.480- 21:26.100* :  to the civilians in Gaza and that means facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid or on trucks
*21:26.100- 21:30.320* :  but also facilitating the establishment of field hospitals for example.
*21:30.320- 21:36.060* :  And let me say right off the top that what happened with the WCK was a tragedy and it was a grave
*21:36.060- 21:40.900* :  mistake Israel and Kogat express our deepest sorrow for what took place.
*21:41.260- 21:45.520* :  How could it have happened though given that you do have those detailed conversations?
*21:45.900- 21:50.300* :  It was a mistake that followed a misidentification but we've set up independent professional
*21:50.300- 21:54.220* :  expert body to investigate it so that we can understand exactly what happened.
*21:54.400- 22:00.140* :  But just to explain to our listeners do you act as a liaison between those aid organizations
*22:00.140- 22:04.860* :  and the Israeli military when it comes to details of aid deliveries?
*22:04.860- 22:09.720* :  We work together with the forces on the ground and with the international organization and we
*22:09.720- 22:14.180* :  coordinate these convoys. So is it fair to say that I understand that an investigation is going
*22:14.180- 22:20.040* :  on but in broad terms something went wrong in passing along the information about where this
*22:20.040- 22:25.880* :  convoy was to the Israeli military if indeed as the Israeli government has said there was an
*22:25.880- 22:29.420* :  element of misidentification I think the word was that was used.
*22:29.760- 22:34.040* :  To the best of my knowledge there wasn't a problem in terms of the information that was passed on.
*22:34.120- 22:39.600* :  There was however as I said a mistake of misidentification and that is being looked into right now
*22:39.600- 22:46.780* :  by the investigation team. Is there a systemic problem about how this system operates and how your
*22:46.780- 22:52.100* :  department operates? We spoke to the UN humanitarian coordinator yesterday who said there were
*22:52.100- 22:58.340* :  too many layers for notification in other words the chances of a miscommunication happening were raised
*22:58.340- 23:03.880* :  by the fact that information had to be passed to too many people and it wasn't always acted upon.
*23:04.160- 23:08.460* :  No I don't think that there is a systemic problem and I think that is evident from the fact that
*23:08.460- 23:12.420* :  there are dozens of coordinations a day and hundreds or thousands of coordinations that have happened
*23:12.420- 23:17.640* :  since the beginning of the war. What happened was an absolute tragedy but I do not believe that
*23:17.640- 23:21.660* :  there is a systemic problem as you described it. Well there have been lots of delivery since the war
*23:21.660- 23:26.940* :  began but there also have been a record number if humanitarian workers killed during the guards
*23:26.940- 23:30.860* :  are conflict. I can tell you that we work very closely with the international organizations
*23:31.480- 23:35.300* :  and with the different agencies in order to coordinate these movements and it's important to
*23:35.300- 23:40.660* :  understand that these convoys are coordinated with us in order to make sure that humanitarian aid
*23:40.660- 23:45.200* :  is getting to whoever needs it. The other thing that the humanitarian coordinator told us,
*23:45.200- 23:50.180* :  Jamie McGolder, he said, that it would be much preferable for organizations to talk to the
*23:50.180- 23:57.440* :  Israeli military directly and not go through your agency. The coordination of this operation is
*23:57.440- 24:02.180* :  something that Koga has been doing since the beginning of the war. We have officers on the ground
*24:02.180- 24:07.840* :  within the forces in order to facilitate and make sure that that coordination is done correctly
*24:07.840- 24:12.180* :  and we'll continue to work with them closely and if we learn from this investigation that there
*24:12.180- 24:17.680* :  are steps that need to be taken, we will of course take them. Shimon Friedman speaking to James
*24:17.680- 24:23.860* :  Menendez. The former president of the Spanish Football Federation Luis Royales has been arrested
*24:23.860- 24:29.500* :  in a corruption investigation. He was detained after stepping off a plane and is suspected
*24:29.500- 24:35.420* :  of receiving illegal commissions when negotiating deals over the Spanish Super Cup competition.
*24:36.100- 24:42.300* :  Such deals can be worth around $45 million. Mr. Rubialis has denied any wrongdoing.
*24:42.920- 24:45.180* :  A correspondent, Guy Hedgeco, in Madrid, explains.
*24:45.860- 24:52.080* :  Investigators believe that Luis Rubialis may have received these illegal commissions while he
*24:52.080- 24:59.180* :  was negotiating these contracts to stage the Spanish Super Cup football competition in Saudi Arabia.
*24:59.180- 25:03.360* :  The competition has been held in Saudi Arabia on a number of occasions over the last few years.
*25:03.840- 25:09.740* :  These contracts are extremely lucrative and the investigators believe that he may have
*25:10.040- 25:15.460* :  personally benefited from them and illegally. So these are very serious allegations against him.
*25:15.720- 25:22.460* :  He denies any wrongdoing. However, separately from that, he is also due to go on trial for
*25:22.460- 25:28.120* :  sexual assault and that's because of the kiss that he gave Jenny and Russell the Spanish player
*25:28.500- 25:32.400* :  at the end of the women's World Cup final last August.
*25:33.220- 25:39.860* :  Guy Hedgeco, in Madrid. The French Parliament has held its first-ever debate based on Britain's
*25:39.860- 25:44.560* :  Prime Minister's questions, a weekly half an hour session in which the leader of the government
*25:44.560- 25:50.700* :  is grilled by parliamentarians. The event is renowned for its rodiness and the cut and thrust of
*25:50.700- 25:56.340* :  debate in which political fortunes have been known to rise and to fall. Here's a flavor.
*26:02.620- 26:09.920* :  Order. I say to the general. I will not tolerate such behavior.
*26:11.220- 26:16.260* :  In Paris, it was French Prime Minister Gabriel Etal who took questions from MPs.
*26:16.600- 26:22.940* :  So did it descend into scenes of chaos? A correspondent in Paris, Yusko Field, was watching.
*26:25.900- 26:31.080* :  It was all the idea of the National Assembly's speaker, Yael Braun-Pivay, who thought the
*26:31.080- 26:35.720* :  existing questions to the government were too boring, and knowing a little of the Westminster
*26:35.720- 26:42.260* :  model decided to create an experimental French QPM, or Kession O'Primele-Manniste.
*26:42.260- 26:46.180* :  Thank you, Madame President. As it happened to the Prime Minister, the very presentable
*26:46.180- 26:50.800* :  Gabriel Etal was more than happy to go along because a bit like his boss President Macron,
*26:50.800- 26:57.240* :  he prides himself on his debating skills and his ability to out- argue the most persistent of
*26:57.240- 27:04.140* :  adversaries. He certainly put on an accomplished show, here defending the government's
*27:04.140- 27:08.900* :  introduction of streaming based on ability in schools, and in something of an echo from across
*27:08.900- 27:16.340* :  the channel, turning on hecklers from the far-left LFI party. There's no point in shouting to get
*27:16.340- 27:24.020* :  me to stop, he said, it doesn't work. The Assembly was certainly a bit fuller and a bit noisy
*27:24.020- 27:29.640* :  than usual, but the truth is these are two houses with such different traditions that trying to
*27:29.640- 27:35.140* :  make the one more like the other is futile. French Parliamentary rhetoric is in general scripted,
*27:35.140- 27:42.200* :  monotone, and totally lacking in the improvisational wit that can make PMQs such fun to watch.
*27:42.480- 27:47.460* :  Perhaps it's only fair to say also that what happens less often resembles a bonfire.
*27:48.160- 27:54.940* :  Use co-filled in Paris. Next to India, where parties in the southern state of Tamil Nadu
*27:55.260- 27:59.800* :  have found a novel way of campaigning for the general election later this month,
*27:59.800- 28:05.940* :  they're using so-called ghost appearances or deep fakes of dead political figures as
*28:05.940- 28:16.120* :  Lippaker Parham reports. This AI-generated voice clip is saying, hello, I am your
*28:16.120- 28:21.720* :  J.A.L.E. speaking. Then the actress-tanned politician who died in 2016,
*28:21.720- 28:27.760* :  urges her voters to bring back the people's government of her party that ruled Tamil Nadu
*28:27.760- 28:36.520* :  from 1991 for 14 years. In an AI-generated video, her art rival, another late former leader,
*28:36.520- 28:42.280* :  M. Karunanithi appeared in his trademark yellow scarf and black sunglasses,
*28:42.280- 28:49.720* :  showering praise on his son, M.K. Stalin, the current chief minister. Karunanithi died in 2018.
*28:50.600- 28:56.080* :  The resurrection of charismatic speakers offers cost-effective campaigning, but critics warn
*28:56.080- 29:00.940* :  such tools are a threat to democracy. Lippaker Parham
*29:01.880- 29:08.340* :  The Chinese-owned online shopping platform Temu has exploded in popularity in the past year,
*29:08.340- 29:14.820* :  shipping to customers in 49 countries around the world. It sells everything from clothes to
*29:14.820- 29:20.300* :  electronics at extremely low prices and even advertised during this year's Super Bowl.
*29:21.040- 29:27.100* :  The BBC's Sam Groey has been investigating how it is so cheap and how it can afford to spend
*29:27.100- 29:37.680* :  millions of dollars on advertising. A record 123 million Americans tuned into the Super Bowl
*29:37.680- 29:42.580* :  last month, they were there for the nation's biggest sporting event and a dazzling half-time
*29:42.940- 29:52.620* :  performance, but they got something else too. Six thirty-second commercials for a Chinese-owned
*29:52.620- 29:58.180* :  online shopping platform that's transforming the world of online e-commerce. Temu
*29:58.380- 30:05.120* :  It launched in the US in 2022 and is the offspring of Pindwa Dwa, which dominates China's home market.
*30:05.340- 30:11.580* :  Every Chinese person is buying their products, whether it be speaker or a t-shirt or socks,
*30:12.340- 30:17.380* :  Sean Ren is the founder of the China Market Research Group. He says there's a reason Temu's
*30:17.380- 30:22.600* :  prices are so low. They're mostly selling unbranded goods. You're able to go straight to the
*30:22.600- 30:26.960* :  consumer straight from the factories, which is why they're able to have such cheap prices.
*30:26.960- 30:32.500* :  It's a bit like Amazon on steroids. That's retail analyst Neil Saunders.
*30:32.820- 30:38.000* :  When you open the app or you go to the site, there's lots of products flashing up, but you,
*30:38.000- 30:44.580* :  lots of discounts, lots of offers. In 2022, they were virtually nothing, and now Temu is
*30:44.580- 30:49.880* :  getting on for tens of millions of downloads a month. A big reason for this advertising.
*30:49.880- 30:55.540* :  The company showed out seven million dollars to run thirty-second commercials during the
*30:55.600- 30:59.820* :  Super Bowl. And we know that after that commercial, Temu downloads really spiked in the US.
*31:00.460- 31:05.400* :  Cheap products must be good for the consumer, right? Well, some people have raised concerns
*31:05.400- 31:11.440* :  about Temu's supply chains, including Alicia Kerns, a British politician for the conservative party.
*31:11.840- 31:16.360* :  So when you look into where Temu gets its goods from, where in China it is producing them,
*31:16.640- 31:20.860* :  you can see that these are areas where we know that there is the use of force-weager slave labor.
*31:21.320- 31:25.400* :  She's talking about the Uyghur people. It's estimated that nearly a million,
*31:25.400- 31:30.780* :  mostly Muslim Uyghurs, are detained in camps in the northwest region of Xinjiang. China
*31:30.780- 31:34.760* :  denies the claims and says the camps are vocational training schools.
*31:35.160- 31:39.240* :  A report from last year from the US Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party
*31:39.240- 31:44.380* :  found there was an extremely high-risk Temu products could have been made using force labor,
*31:44.380- 31:49.980* :  as the company only requires suppliers to agree to a code of conduct. Temu says it's strictly
*31:49.980- 31:56.180* :  prohibits the use of forced penal or child labor by all of its merchants. But with prices so low,
*31:56.180- 32:01.740* :  some people feel they don't have a choice about shopping at Temu, like single mum Rina who lives
*32:02.300- 32:06.340* :  in the UK. Sometimes I feel guilty, you know, because I know this past fashion,
*32:06.340- 32:11.080* :  unfortunately, at this time I cannot go to more sustainable shops.
*32:11.580- 32:17.400* :  US consumers do seem to be buying into Temu. It was Apple's most downloaded free app in 2023,
*32:17.420- 32:23.580* :  and currently has more than 100 million active users. Temu now wants to take on its China-owned
*32:23.580- 32:29.200* :  retail rival Sheen, and ultimately Amazon. But with politicians viewing Chinese own companies
*32:29.200- 32:34.180* :  with growing hostility, that might not be so easy. Sam Gruye reporting.

*33:13.960- 33:18.960* :  It's called guided democracy or managed democracy. There are different parties,
*33:18.960- 33:22.860* :  different candidates, but everyone knows who is going to win.
*33:22.960- 33:26.180* :  The Global Jigsaw is the podcast helping you make sense of them.
*33:26.500- 33:30.900* :  We've seen a crackdown on the opposition. We've seen an increase in censorship.
