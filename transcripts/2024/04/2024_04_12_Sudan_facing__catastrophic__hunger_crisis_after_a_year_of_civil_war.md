*01:19.680- 01:22.120* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.140- 01:29.500* :  I'm Paul Boss and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 12th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:29.500- 01:35.560* :  We have an exclusive report from Sudan where some areas already affected by war are now
*01:35.580- 01:36.440* :  facing famine.
*01:36.740- 01:39.820* :  There's warning of an imminent Iranian attack on Israel.
*01:40.400- 01:44.240* :  It's been a warning that Russia has been bribing members of the European Parliament.
*01:46.520- 01:49.400* :  Also in this podcast, mothers missing their daughters.
*01:49.940- 01:51.100* :  I still look at our teachers.
*01:51.620- 01:56.260* :  Sometimes people say you have other kids, but when I'm alone, it's never easy.
*01:56.740- 02:00.200* :  It's one decade since the abduction of Nigeria's Chibok girls.
*02:00.940- 02:03.360* :  Now we have an intergalactic mystery for you.
*02:03.560- 02:08.700* :  How did a star manage to explode giving off more light than ever before seen?
*02:13.820- 02:17.000* :  Millions of people displaced sexual violence endemic.
*02:17.480- 02:20.780* :  And now what's described as a catastrophic hunger crisis.
*02:21.040- 02:24.480* :  The conflict in Sudan has been called the world's forgotten war.
*02:24.960- 02:30.260* :  It began last April when a rebel group known as the Rapid Support Force took up arms against
*02:30.260- 02:31.300* :  the national government.
*02:31.300- 02:36.760* :  Now after a year of fighting, the medical charity Doctors Without Borders says it's found
*02:36.760- 02:40.480* :  a third of the people in one refugee camp were malnourished.
*02:41.060- 02:45.600* :  If the war has been forgotten, that's partly because it's so difficult for outsiders
*02:45.600- 02:50.860* :  to gain access, but the BBC has managed to get rare material from one affected area
*02:51.300- 02:53.300* :  with the help of a local freelance journalist.
*02:53.300- 02:56.080* :  You may have heard a short report about this in our last edition.
*02:56.580- 02:59.000* :  A correspondent Barbara Pled Asher has more.
*03:02.440- 03:07.180* :  Here in the Zamzam camp for displaced people, women and children are queuing for food.
*03:07.680- 03:11.160* :  There isn't much of that, nor of clean water or health care.
*03:11.820- 03:14.420* :  Illnesses that could once be treated, now kill.
*03:15.100- 03:17.720* :  One child here dies every two hours.
*03:19.980- 03:23.940* :  Kisma Abdul Rahman Ali Abu Bakr is 27 years old.
*03:24.680- 03:27.320* :  She lost three children in four months.
*03:29.840- 03:31.480* :  I have three children who have died.
*03:32.060- 03:35.600* :  My three-year-old daughter died after 11 days of falling sick.
*03:36.280- 03:38.000* :  The second one was two years old.
*03:38.600- 03:40.100* :  He died from malnutrition.
*03:40.580- 03:42.220* :  I couldn't take them to the hospital.
*03:42.880- 03:44.780* :  After that, I had a daughter who died.
*03:44.860- 03:46.800* :  She was six months old.
*03:48.160- 03:53.140* :  Zamzam is one of Sudan's oldest and largest camps, formed by those who fled ethnic violence
*03:53.140- 03:56.660* :  in Darfur 20 years ago, so already fragile.
*03:57.580- 04:02.120* :  But the latest war between the army and its paramilitary rivals has displaced more than
*04:02.160- 04:06.120* :  8 million people, blocked aid and shut down the economy.
*04:09.420- 04:11.840* :  Because I have another boy, I came with him here.
*04:12.380- 04:15.100* :  People are exhausted, bewildered and hungry.
*04:15.460- 04:17.240* :  They are all suffering from hunger.
*04:17.820- 04:19.060* :  This is why they came here.
*04:19.420- 04:21.920* :  People live on borrowing today to pay back tomorrow.
*04:22.540- 04:23.640* :  This is how they survive.
*04:24.180- 04:26.960* :  Our conditions are not allowing us to visit the doctor.
*04:27.020- 04:29.780* :  We are all the same, just living like this.
*04:31.380- 04:36.300* :  The youngest casualties of Sudan's conflict are often not victims of bullets and bombs.
*04:37.100- 04:42.460* :  This pediatric hospital in northern Darfur, close to Zamzam, is a front line in the country's
*04:42.520- 04:43.220* :  hunger crisis.
*04:44.360- 04:44.920* :  For a soon.
*04:45.000- 04:47.560* :  Dr. Esadine Ibrahim checks up on the patients.
*04:48.260- 04:51.880* :  One woman has six-year-old twins who've wasted away from chronic dysentery.
*04:51.880- 04:54.040* :  She's feeding them with a syringe.
*04:54.880- 04:59.400* :  The medical charity Doctors Without Borders is one of the last humanitarian agencies still
*04:59.400- 05:00.680* :  on the ground in Darfur.
*05:01.320- 05:05.300* :  In recent nutrition screening, it found that a third of the children in Zamzam under the
*05:05.300- 05:08.020* :  age of five are malnourished, so are their mothers.
*05:08.840- 05:14.080* :  That and the collapse of health services cause many deaths, says Dr. Prince Juma Safari.
*05:14.500- 05:17.160* :  He's the group's deputy medical coordinator in Sudan.
*05:17.540- 05:18.600* :  There is need everywhere.
*05:18.860- 05:21.960* :  They need water, they need food, some of them need shelter.
*05:22.460- 05:25.460* :  And now we know that we have a lot of challenges for supply.
*05:25.460- 05:29.940* :  If the situation continues like that, the situation will become very catastrophic.
*05:30.920- 05:36.300* :  As bad as the situation is in Zamzam, other parts of Darfur are even more cut off and desperate.
*05:39.060- 05:42.720* :  I spoke to a regional emergency worker who sent us photographs from the southern and
*05:42.720- 05:43.600* :  central states.
*05:44.160- 05:47.320* :  One shows an emaciated little girl said to have died last month.
*05:47.880- 05:50.100* :  Another an equally wasted little boy.
*05:53.420- 05:57.860* :  His mother Fatima Muhammad Afman recorded a video pleading for help to feed her 10
*05:57.860- 05:58.280* :  children.
*05:58.780- 06:01.940* :  They are living between starvation and death, she says.
*06:03.240- 06:07.720* :  Aid workers say it won't be possible to turn the tide on this catastrophe unless there
*06:07.720- 06:13.560* :  is much greater access, a surge of food supplies, and the return of more humanitarian agencies.
*06:14.600- 06:19.360* :  If the war stretches into another year, many, many more children will die.
*06:20.060- 06:21.140* :  Barbara Plet Asha
*06:22.160- 06:25.400* :  France has joined the U.S. in warning about travel to Israel.
*06:25.400- 06:30.480* :  Indeed its foreign ministry told citizens they shouldn't travel to Israel at all, or Lebanon,
*06:30.480- 06:32.580* :  Iran or the Palestinian territories.
*06:33.340- 06:36.680* :  It's yet another sign of rising tensions in the Middle East.
*06:36.680- 06:40.920* :  The Wall Street Journal newspaper has reported that Iran will launch an attack on Israel
*06:40.920- 06:42.780* :  within the next 48 hours.
*06:43.460- 06:47.660* :  The government in Tehran has been threatening to retaliate since its consulate in Syria
*06:47.660- 06:48.940* :  was destroyed last week.
*06:49.360- 06:52.120* :  Most observers assuming that Israel was responsible.
*06:52.580- 06:57.540* :  A spokeswoman for the Pentagon Sabrina Singh made it clear Israel could count on American
*06:57.540- 06:58.040* :  support.
*06:58.700- 07:02.580* :  The president said we have an ironclad commitment to protecting Israel and their self-defense.
*07:03.140- 07:09.000* :  So if any incoming attacks were to be targeted or come in the vicinity of U.S. forces, you've
*07:09.000- 07:10.240* :  seen U.S. forces engage.
*07:10.240- 07:14.940* :  We've seen us do dynamic strikes that we continue to do in the Red Sea and in the Gulf
*07:14.940- 07:19.020* :  of Aden when the Houthis have launched missiles at commercial vessels.
*07:19.180- 07:20.800* :  Those are what we call dynamic strikes.
*07:20.800- 07:21.960* :  That's what you could see.
*07:22.120- 07:24.540* :  We don't know what an attack might look like.
*07:24.980- 07:29.920* :  All I can tell you is that we remain postured and ready should our forces be attacked.
*07:30.460- 07:33.800* :  So that's the view from Washington, but what about the mood in Israel itself?
*07:33.800- 07:39.440* :  A correspondent in Jerusalem, Hugo Bicega, says that so far, people there are proving
*07:39.980- 07:40.500* :  remarkably calm.
*07:41.060- 07:46.640* :  I haven't seen any sign of panic, people making additional preparations, there hasn't
*07:46.640- 07:52.360* :  been any run on shops, banks, the instructions for the public, haven't really changed.
*07:52.860- 07:59.720* :  I think last week we saw the first indications that Iran was planning a response and the
*07:59.720- 08:05.400* :  military here cancelled leave of combat units, boosted air defense teams.
*08:05.400- 08:11.440* :  But apart from that, I haven't seen any kind of difference in preparations from the population.
*08:11.960- 08:18.040* :  There's a risk I know of sounding way too sanguine, but the fact is that Iran has made this
*08:18.040- 08:19.960* :  kind of blood-curdling threat before.
*08:20.640- 08:22.580* :  Do we know how credible this one is?
*08:23.200- 08:25.080* :  Well, so this is what the Americans are saying, right?
*08:25.100- 08:29.680* :  They say that this responses a matter of when, not if.
*08:29.680- 08:35.300* :  So I guess they are very confident that they've gathered intelligence information to indicate
*08:35.300- 08:40.480* :  that this is what the Iranians are planning to do, and this reminds me a lot of what happened
*08:40.480- 08:46.560* :  before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 when they publicly shared information essentially
*08:46.560- 08:48.700* :  saying we know what you're planning to do.
*08:48.860- 08:53.540* :  So these are the warnings, even President Biden has said that the Iranians are planning
*08:53.540- 08:57.600* :  a significant attack, but we don't know how this is going to be.
*08:57.600- 09:03.300* :  But I think the attack that happened in Syria was humiliating for Iran because it was a
*09:03.300- 09:09.300* :  strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound that killed several military advisors, including
*09:09.300- 09:11.140* :  a top Iranian general.
*09:11.140- 09:17.040* :  So the Iranians have out to respond, and I think they need to be seen as giving a response,
*09:17.040- 09:18.560* :  a retaliation.
*09:18.600- 09:23.160* :  So for them, I think this needs to be something different and big.
*09:23.940- 09:28.240* :  We know that there have been these efforts all around the region, and in the U.S. to stop
*09:28.240- 09:34.100* :  the Gaza conflict escalating into a regional one, which is what such an attack would represent.
*09:34.100- 09:39.180* :  I mean, are the efforts continuing at, well, they might well be that this sort of very last
*09:39.200- 09:39.600* :  hour?
*09:41.760- 09:41.780* :  Yes.
*09:41.780- 09:44.640* :  So we're seeing the warnings, you know, public warnings, especially from the Americans, also
*09:44.640- 09:45.440* :  from the Israelis.
*09:45.460- 09:51.600* :  But there has been a lot of diplomatic activity as well to try to de-escalate the situation.
*09:51.760- 09:58.000* :  So the U.S. Secretary of State has urged countries to tell Iran to reduce stations.
*09:58.580- 10:03.500* :  The foreign ministers in the UK, Germany, Australia have phoned the Iranian foreign minister
*10:03.500- 10:06.620* :  to essentially say don't attack Israel.
*10:07.220- 10:09.220* :  So it is a dangerous moment.
*10:09.340- 10:12.020* :  The Americans are saying this is imminent.
*10:12.020- 10:15.700* :  So I guess a lot of people are just waiting to see what is going to happen.
*10:16.340- 10:17.720* :  Hugo Bacheger in Jerusalem.
*10:18.960- 10:22.840* :  Some of the members of the European Parliament have been paid to support Russia.
*10:23.320- 10:27.380* :  That's what Belgians Prime Minister claims the Parliament is based in the Belgian capital.
*10:27.880- 10:33.240* :  And Alexander de Croix said MEPs have been receiving money from Moscow in return for taking
*10:33.240- 10:34.800* :  a more pro-Russian line.
*10:34.800- 10:37.320* :  Here's our Brussels correspondent, Nick Beeg.
*10:38.020- 10:42.660* :  Last month, the Czech Prime Minister announced that a pro-Mosko network had been uncovered,
*10:42.660- 10:47.320* :  that was aiming to spread Russian influence and undermine security across Europe.
*10:47.320- 10:52.240* :  Today, the Belgian Prime Minister said he was aware of evidence of such an operation,
*10:52.240- 10:56.240* :  which was also designed to weaken European support for Ukraine.
*10:56.380- 11:01.980* :  Mr de Croix said his country were now also investigating, claiming that although cash payments
*11:01.980- 11:08.240* :  were not made here, Belgium had a responsibility to act, being the home of the EU institutions.
*11:09.000- 11:14.160* :  European Parliament elections take place in June, with many centrist politicians concerned
*11:14.160- 11:19.600* :  about the level of support that may go to far-right parties, many of which have shown
*11:19.600- 11:20.920* :  support for Russia.
*11:21.520- 11:22.500* :  Nick Beeg from Brussels
*11:23.360- 11:25.900* :  Astronomers have a bit of a puzzle on their hands.
*11:26.340- 11:32.360* :  It was in October 2022 that they detected what was literally the brightest burst of light
*11:32.360- 11:33.440* :  ever recorded.
*11:33.880- 11:38.840* :  Now, they know what it was, a star exploding the phenomenon known as a supernova.
*11:39.680- 11:43.620* :  But the puzzle came when they discovered that the star responsible was a normal size.
*11:43.620- 11:46.840* :  It shouldn't have made such a big bang on its exit.
*11:47.440- 11:52.200* :  I spoke about this to our science correspondent, Palab Gouge, asked him first to explain why
*11:52.200- 11:54.620* :  any stars end their lives by exploding.
*11:55.220- 11:57.440* :  The physics is incredibly simple.
*11:58.020- 12:03.680* :  All stars, fusion reactors, they produce heat and light as a result, but when they run
*12:03.680- 12:10.660* :  out of fuel, all the hydrogen gas has got nothing to push it away, so it collapses and
*12:10.660- 12:16.480* :  forms either a neutron star or a black hole and all the other stuff explodes.
*12:17.440- 12:24.660* :  But this particular explosion was 100 times greater than anything that had been before.
*12:24.700- 12:30.180* :  It was so big that it completely scrambled all the telescopes that were looking at it.
*12:30.240- 12:32.180* :  So they weren't sure that it was a black hole.
*12:32.620- 12:38.440* :  This latest result has found that it was a supernova, but an ordinary supernova.
*12:38.860- 12:44.660* :  Supernovas do happen from time to time, but there's been nothing on this scale before.
*12:45.280- 12:50.140* :  So it is a real mystery as to why it was so bright, it was, as I say, a hundred times
*12:50.140- 12:53.080* :  brighter than anything that had ever come before.
*12:53.340- 12:54.560* :  OK, there's the mystery.
*12:55.260- 12:57.300* :  Any idea do we have what the answer is?
*12:57.300- 12:59.060* :  Why was this one such a big bang?
*12:59.700- 13:02.060* :  Well, that's the start of a new research project.
*13:02.060- 13:06.820* :  It was the James Webb Space Telescope that uncovered the fact that it was a normal supernova.
*13:06.900- 13:08.580* :  So there must have been something else going on.
*13:08.620- 13:13.960* :  Either the gas around it was particularly condensed, maybe the galaxy was different to our own.
*13:14.140- 13:15.620* :  And so things just behave differently.
*13:15.620- 13:20.520* :  So that's the thing about science that you think you know it until you find some experimental
*13:20.520- 13:24.660* :  result that tells you you don't, but then you have to revise your theories.
*13:24.660- 13:26.160* :  And that's exactly what's going on.
*13:26.160- 13:32.220* :  Another interesting fact was that everyone who studies this at university told that supernova
*13:32.220- 13:37.020* :  create the heavy elements in our universe, the gold and platinum, but in this case,
*13:37.020- 13:39.660* :  there wasn't any, so another mystery to be solved.
*13:40.140- 13:44.320* :  It's one of those ones where a presumed of this anomaly then will end up increasing our
*13:44.320- 13:45.500* :  knowledge of supernovas.
*13:45.800- 13:47.200* :  Well, that's exactly right.
*13:47.580- 13:52.120* :  I mean, supernova are actually very rare and very frequent, you only get one or two
*13:52.120- 13:58.780* :  a century in a particular galaxy because the universe is so vast, we can see a few hundred
*13:59.080- 13:59.640* :  each year.
*14:00.060- 14:06.040* :  So that'll be enough information for astronomers to look at supernova in detail and come up
*14:06.040- 14:06.860* :  with a brand new theory.
*14:06.860- 14:08.900* :  And hopefully we'll be talking about that very soon.
*14:09.320- 14:09.960* :  Palab gauche.
*14:13.260- 14:20.200* :  Coming up in this podcast, they promise to lower taxes from 2025 onwards.
*14:20.800- 14:26.620* :  And as a sort of cherry on the cake, really, they offered free transport for the under-25s.
*14:26.940- 14:32.020* :  Maya City in Switzerland ended up with a billion and a half dollars to spare and isn't quite
*14:40.760- 14:40.880* :  sure what to do with it.
*14:40.960- 14:43.040* :  Hey, it's Paige Desorba from Giggly Squad.

*15:51.920- 15:57.920* :  It was big news 10 years ago when a group of more than 270 schoolgirls were seized from
*15:57.920- 15:59.420* :  the Nigerian town of Chibok.
*15:59.860- 16:05.040* :  The militant Islamic group Boka Haram were responsible and many of the girls remain missing.
*16:05.560- 16:10.660* :  But a decade on and kidnapping has become endemic in the country, with different factions
*16:10.660- 16:15.560* :  carving out their own areas of operation, much of it carried out purely for financial gain.
*16:16.040- 16:20.080* :  The BBC's Aziz Adela Lua visited Chibok and has this report.
*16:21.720- 16:26.040* :  Our team is on the road towards Chibok and we have left from Yulah in the early hours.
*16:26.800- 16:32.600* :  We've already passed eight military checkpoints, manned by heavily armed soldiers of the Nigerian
*16:32.600- 16:32.900* :  Army.
*16:33.840- 16:39.180* :  The security threats in this part of the country are still very real and incidents along
*16:39.180- 16:43.800* :  the road as well as beyond are unfortunately still very common.
*16:45.520- 16:51.060* :  After more than five hours on the road, we finally arrive in Chibok town and head straight
*16:51.060- 16:52.660* :  to Esther Yakubu's house.
*16:53.480- 16:57.720* :  She is sitting on a mat inside her compound on a sunny Sunday afternoon.
*16:58.400- 17:03.180* :  In her thin hand, she is tightly holding on to two photographs with fading images.
*17:04.000- 17:05.960* :  It shows her missing daughter, doctors.
*17:06.720- 17:07.840* :  I still look at her pictures.
*17:08.460- 17:13.040* :  Sometimes people say you have other kids, but when I'm alone, it's never easy.
*17:16.360- 17:22.600* :  The pictures are the only possessions she has kept of doctors, who was one of the 276 school
*17:22.600- 17:25.420* :  girls kidnapped in the town a decade ago.
*17:26.280- 17:31.660* :  While many have returned home or managed to flee, doctors and over 80 other girls are
*17:31.820- 17:32.320* :  still missing.
*17:33.660- 17:39.040* :  I'm trusting in God, I'm also having hope that won't get closer.
*17:40.960- 17:45.420* :  The body school where the abduction took place is just a short five minutes drive from
*17:45.420- 17:46.300* :  Esther's house.
*17:46.640- 17:51.300* :  The crimp-colored, painted, low-rise buildings were rebuilt, while some other structures
*17:51.640- 17:52.320* :  look abandoned.
*17:52.980- 17:59.120* :  The school reopened in 2021, and the new principal, Mohamed Shiruma, is keen to welcome more
*17:59.260- 17:59.520* :  students.
*18:00.600- 18:07.340* :  As you can see, this school, almost every part of the school, within an outside, surrounded
*18:07.340- 18:14.740* :  by military, and we have a very tight security that it is only those who are outside, but
*18:14.740- 18:18.320* :  those of us, as you come in here, you just feel as if you are at home.
*18:19.240- 18:24.840* :  From the school, it's a short walk through streets that are almost deserted to Chibok's
*18:24.840- 18:27.800* :  central market, which is more busy and lively.
*18:28.540- 18:34.000* :  Ten years after the town shot to global fame, some residents like Hassan Usman, a trader,
*18:34.500- 18:38.480* :  tell me insecurity is still affecting every part of their lives.
*18:38.980- 18:43.980* :  The security in Chibok here has affected our business seriously, especially like my own
*18:44.540- 18:49.660* :  that I'm into building materials, because nobody is willing to come and build his house
*18:49.660- 18:51.260* :  or renovate his house again.
*18:52.360- 18:54.920* :  Manasi Allen was born and raised in Chibok.
*18:55.360- 19:00.240* :  He moved to the federal capital, Abuja, after he lost his business to Bukharaam.
*19:00.740- 19:03.380* :  He believes, little has changed in the town.
*19:03.980- 19:10.060* :  Governance generally is at its lowest around here, so social amenities and other things
*19:10.060- 19:10.680* :  are lacking.
*19:10.680- 19:17.800* :  So, the town is actually not showing anything that is different from what it used to be.
*19:18.180- 19:23.540* :  Senator Ali Andume is the National Lawmaker in Abuja, representing the district where
*19:23.540- 19:24.720* :  Chibok is located.
*19:25.200- 19:30.060* :  The government did not forget about this issue of Chibok girls, they are looking out to
*19:30.060- 19:36.460* :  it, and most of the leadership of the Nigerian army, particularly now, the Chibok army staff,
*19:36.460- 19:42.260* :  the Chibok defense staff, the Chibok Air Force were all part of the, you know, at one
*19:42.300- 19:43.600* :  time something in the theater.
*19:44.740- 19:50.760* :  And the priority there is recovery of not only the Chibok girls, but other kidnapped victims.
*19:51.380- 19:57.060* :  For ten years, Esther and the other parents of the over 80 girls still missing have been
*19:57.060- 20:03.300* :  longing to see their daughters again, despite the many years passed, their hope has not
*20:03.300- 20:03.780* :  faded.
*20:04.460- 20:07.860* :  As he's at Al-Alua, and if you want to hear more from as he's at, you can listen to the
*20:07.860- 20:12.760* :  latest episode of the Global Story Podcast, just search for that title wherever you get
*20:12.760- 20:13.440* :  your podcasts.
*20:14.720- 20:20.880* :  Here's a grim fact, Thursday saw 60 people killed on the roads in Thailand, and another
*20:20.880- 20:22.940* :  20 have already been killed on Friday.
*20:23.520- 20:28.660* :  But whilst this figure is high, it's not so unusual to have a large number of driving
*20:28.660- 20:34.280* :  deaths in mid-April, because it's the country's traditional New Year holiday, when many people
*20:34.280- 20:37.000* :  travel home, and then celebrate in the streets.
*20:37.000- 20:41.100* :  And this year, the Thai government's this year to rather desperate warning, appealing
*20:41.100- 20:46.260* :  to people to drive carefully, I spoke to our Asia-Pacific regional editor, Celia Hatten,
*20:46.260- 20:50.620* :  who told me first why so many holiday travelers end up being killed.
*20:51.280- 20:55.760* :  This is the start of the Thai Buddhist New Year holiday, it's known as the Songgran
*20:55.760- 21:02.080* :  Water Festival, and it's also dubbed by the Thai authorities as the start of the seven
*21:02.080- 21:03.340* :  dangerous days.
*21:03.800- 21:05.600* :  And that's because you just have to picture it.
*21:05.640- 21:08.380* :  This is the biggest holiday of the year in Thailand.
*21:08.380- 21:13.260* :  This is when many people, many young people, I mean, Thailand, we have to remember, has a
*21:13.260- 21:18.240* :  really young population, a lot of people, under the age of 30, pile onto the back of
*21:18.240- 21:22.120* :  mopeds, and drive home, often to their hometowns.
*21:22.120- 21:25.520* :  This might be one of the few times of year they can see their friends and their family,
*21:25.840- 21:27.000* :  and they really let loose.
*21:27.060- 21:32.980* :  This is a big party holiday, a lot of huge family get-togethers, and a lot of drinking
*21:32.980- 21:33.340* :  really.
*21:33.580- 21:34.800* :  That's part of the holiday.
*21:34.800- 21:40.420* :  And so the authorities say that the traffic deaths are kind of in concert with that, because
*21:40.420- 21:43.700* :  people will go out, and then they really let their defenses down.
*21:43.700- 21:47.680* :  A lot of people don't wear helmets while they're on the back of motorcycles and mopeds.
*21:47.680- 21:54.040* :  A lot of these fatal accidents take place within five kilometers of family homes.
*21:54.580- 21:58.980* :  And a lot of them are motorcycles that are involved in fatal accidents with no other
*21:58.980- 22:00.160* :  vehicles involved.
*22:00.160- 22:05.880* :  So a lot of a drink driving where the motorcycle spins out of control, and then the driver
*22:05.880- 22:06.380* :  is dead.
*22:06.800- 22:11.320* :  You make this sound horribly predictable and horribly preventable listening to you.
*22:11.320- 22:15.520* :  I mean, what is it that people just say, well, that's one of the things that happens
*22:15.520- 22:18.240* :  this time of year accepted as part of life?
*22:18.480- 22:23.600* :  Well, I don't know if there is that fatalistic about it, but there is a big kind of national
*22:23.600- 22:30.960* :  conversation around drink driving and the need to follow safety concerns ahead of this
*22:30.960- 22:32.480* :  big Songkran water festival.
*22:32.480- 22:37.200* :  So there are campaigns, though, within the government to start punishing drunk drivers
*22:37.200- 22:41.900* :  more, to send them straight to prison, especially repeat offenders, and to punish those who
*22:41.900- 22:45.440* :  sell alcohol to drivers or people they know they're about to drive.
*22:45.880- 22:50.960* :  And then also to make this more of an alcohol-free holiday for those who want to celebrate without
*22:50.960- 22:51.280* :  drinking.
*22:51.700- 22:52.500* :  Celia Hadden
*22:53.500- 22:57.780* :  Goldkeeper, Jake Kansar, has been playing in Spanish football for a few years now.
*22:57.780- 23:02.440* :  He was born in Senegal and plays for the third tier club side, Ryo Mahata-onda.
*23:03.100- 23:08.020* :  A few weeks ago, he was playing in a match against a team called Sestal and was a victim
*23:08.020- 23:09.020* :  of racial abuse.
*23:09.020- 23:13.640* :  However, it was him that was punished for his reaction to that abuse.
*23:13.640- 23:17.600* :  Our sports reporter Isaac Fanon spoke to him and asked him what happened.
*23:20.860- 23:24.160* :  Last Saturday, we're playing in Bilbao against his style.
*23:24.960- 23:28.300* :  In the second half, I heard some monkey noises coming from inside the stadium.
*23:28.620- 23:33.560* :  In the 83rd minute, a fan, an ultran in the stands, came down when we called the second
*23:33.560- 23:33.820* :  goal.
*23:39.640- 23:41.620* :  He came down and started insulting me.
*23:42.540- 23:45.640* :  He was saying all sorts of things like, you black monkey.
*23:48.080- 23:50.520* :  So I just jumped into the stands to go and find him.
*23:50.800- 23:52.060* :  I didn't want anything violent.
*23:52.800- 23:56.480* :  I just wanted to find him because I wanted the video to go around.
*23:57.260- 24:02.180* :  I wanted it to be viral on social media so people could see what is happening and could
*24:02.180- 24:04.760* :  see the face of the one who has been insulting me.
*24:04.900- 24:07.440* :  And how did it make you feel at the time?
*24:10.980- 24:13.380* :  I was angry and I was very sad as well.
*24:14.140- 24:19.180* :  Because as a player who comes to Europe to play, who tries to feed his family back in Africa,
*24:19.760- 24:21.480* :  it's just very hurtful.
*24:22.020- 24:28.360* :  If I was a youngster, a child at best may be able to understand, but here was an old man
*24:28.420- 24:29.780* :  throwing insults.
*24:30.440- 24:31.180* :  It's really hurt.
*24:31.460- 24:33.360* :  And that is why I reacted the way I did.
*24:33.920- 24:35.160* :  I wanted to show his face.
*24:35.160- 24:40.740* :  I wanted people to be able to see him so that he could be identified because it really
*24:40.740- 24:41.340* :  hurt me.
*24:41.880- 24:43.680* :  And that's why I reacted like that.
*24:44.440- 24:46.180* :  I didn't want to be aggressive or violent.
*24:46.260- 24:47.540* :  That was not my intention.
*24:47.900- 24:52.920* :  I just wanted people to see how people can insult us on the ground.
*24:54.900- 25:00.440* :  I want to ask about things that have happened since that game.
*25:01.340- 25:03.300* :  You were given a too much ban.
*25:03.800- 25:04.660* :  Do you know why?
*25:07.040- 25:11.360* :  Yes, indeed I got a too much ban and a 600 euros fine as well.
*25:11.660- 25:16.480* :  This too much ban was for jumping across the barrier to go and find this guy and it
*25:16.480- 25:22.100* :  is that gesture that has been sanctioned by the league because they thought it was inappropriate.
*25:22.980- 25:25.500* :  And my team was fined 3,000 euros as well.
*25:25.640- 25:26.840* :  Do you think that's fair?
*25:29.040- 25:34.440* :  To fight against racism, to get rid of racism in football and in the world, I think football
*25:34.440- 25:37.440* :  should be something that unites people.
*25:38.200- 25:39.080* :  We should be a family.
*25:39.960- 25:44.780* :  So if someone is a victim of racism, I think no, it is not fair.
*25:45.180- 25:46.980* :  I know I shouldn't have jumped in the stands.
*25:47.140- 25:49.360* :  I didn't know I was going to be fine when I jumped.
*25:49.860- 25:51.040* :  I didn't think about that.
*25:51.140- 25:54.720* :  But if someone is a victim of racism, there should not be sanctioned.
*25:54.900- 25:55.940* :  We should protect the player.
*25:56.900- 25:57.920* :  Jake Canesar
*25:58.780- 26:02.160* :  Now finally, I'm sure it's a problem familiar to many listeners.
*26:02.560- 26:07.520* :  What do you do if you find yourself with one and a half billion dollars going spare?
*26:08.040- 26:12.420* :  That's the challenge if you can call it that, which faces Geneva in Switzerland.
*26:12.900- 26:17.840* :  It's collected so much tax, the local authorities are now not sure what to do with it.
*26:18.220- 26:21.640* :  Our reporter Stephanie Prentice has been considering the options.
*26:22.380- 26:27.660* :  I'm sure any government officials listening would love to be in that position and overflow
*26:27.660- 26:29.680* :  over the public purse, not a deficit.
*26:30.360- 26:35.940* :  And the Cantorneau region of Geneva has responded with the session first of not raising taxes
*26:36.740- 26:39.880* :  and of free public transport for young people.
*26:40.540- 26:45.260* :  Now when it comes to the population in and around Geneva, you don't have to be wealthy
*26:45.260- 26:46.900* :  to live there, but it helps.
*26:46.900- 26:49.180* :  And of course, not everyone is.
*26:49.180- 26:53.920* :  So this idea of free public transport, the under 25s, that's been very well received.
*26:54.560- 26:58.580* :  From a social sort of perspective, it is quite a rental culture there.
*26:58.800- 27:02.460* :  We know younger people are finding it hard to lock down those affordable rents.
*27:02.640- 27:04.740* :  Free transport would obviously ease that strain.
*27:05.260- 27:08.360* :  And from a lifestyle sort of thing, it would apply to the whole Cantorne.
*27:08.360- 27:12.380* :  So imagine you could get in a train, go up to the Montreux Jazz Festival with your friends,
*27:12.380- 27:13.700* :  you can go up to the mountains.
*27:14.260- 27:18.980* :  And the government also says if this passes, it could be in place fairly quickly.
*27:19.620- 27:25.320* :  Now for another angle, the free transport, it's also getting a big thumbs up from a climate
*27:25.920- 27:25.940* :  perspective.
*27:26.360- 27:30.160* :  So it's seen as encouraging that younger generation to move away from using cars.
*27:31.320- 27:35.920* :  Now, I'm more used to reporting on places where they've short of money, short of tax
*27:35.920- 27:36.740* :  revenues, etc.
*27:36.740- 27:41.360* :  But I know you've been looking into this and there are other examples of places that
*27:41.360- 27:44.120* :  suddenly found themselves with spare cash on their hands.
*27:45.020- 27:45.200* :  Yes.
*27:45.200- 27:48.220* :  So in Switzerland, Geneva isn't an exception.
*27:48.340- 27:50.340* :  There's another affluent Cantorne of Zoug.
*27:50.340- 27:54.000* :  It's also used to seeing its public finances do very, very well.
*27:54.500- 27:57.620* :  But this year, in particular, it's going very well.
*27:58.000- 28:00.980* :  So much so, actually, but the local press launched this competition.
*28:00.980- 28:06.300* :  They were asking people to write in, give them ideas of what to do with all this spare
*28:06.300- 28:06.700* :  money.
*28:07.220- 28:12.200* :  They did initially look at digging giant tunnels, those ideas kept being rejected by planning.
*28:12.260- 28:18.080* :  They looked at free public transport as well, and even the idea of building a gigantic
*28:18.160- 28:19.060* :  ski slope.
*28:19.420- 28:19.580* :  Yeah.
*28:19.940- 28:20.520* :  Right, near the mountains.
*28:21.180- 28:26.920* :  Around the world, as we've said, excess public cash doesn't tend to be that much of an
*28:26.920- 28:27.200* :  issue.
*28:27.460- 28:31.860* :  But we have seen other governments do some, we could call interesting things, the public
*28:31.860- 28:32.180* :  money.
*28:32.660- 28:36.740* :  So in Sweden, for example, the government is currently planning this art exhibit.
*28:36.740- 28:38.680* :  Imagine it's in a railway station.
*28:38.820- 28:41.020* :  It's called forever employment.
*28:41.520- 28:45.560* :  And the person they pick as part of it, they'll be employed to live in a room in that station
*28:45.920- 28:48.520* :  for the rest of their life to do whatever they want.
*28:48.520- 28:51.080* :  And that'll be funded by the taxpayer.
*28:51.760- 28:53.680* :  The prison service there, they also got invented.
*28:53.680- 28:59.420* :  They spent almost $100,000 on making a podcast with the prisoners and marketing it.
*29:00.060- 29:02.160* :  And a story we covered here that I really enjoyed.
*29:02.160- 29:04.720* :  It was from the Tasmanian Premier Jeremy Rockliff.
*29:05.180- 29:11.000* :  He was campaigning on building the world's largest chocolate fountain if he was re-elected.
*29:11.000- 29:13.300* :  That was actually a quite divisive policy.
*29:13.720- 29:18.240* :  Now he actually was re-elected with a minority in Italy, so he'll keep an eye on whether
*29:18.240- 29:20.380* :  he gets that particular policy over the line.
*29:20.840- 29:22.040* :  OK, I'm going to be a bit unfair here.
*29:22.040- 29:25.800* :  As you've looked into all what these other people have done, I'm going to let you imagine
*29:25.800- 29:29.700* :  you suddenly find yourself ahead of a regional council and you've got a billion and a half
*29:29.700- 29:30.620* :  dollars to spare.
*29:30.620- 29:32.160* :  What would you spend it on?
*29:32.900- 29:33.760* :  Well, thanks for asking.
*29:33.760- 29:35.420* :  I do often imagine that.
*29:35.660- 29:40.000* :  I think the temptation to lean into sub-like corruption would be strong to build myself,
*29:40.000- 29:43.040* :  perhaps a mega-challet up in the mountains.
*29:43.040- 29:46.240* :  But I did also have a think about, I could do fondue Fridays.
*29:46.240- 29:49.720* :  There's only 200,000 people in that kind of Geneva.
*29:49.720- 29:55.200* :  I could buy them all of fondue every Friday for, I think, around 300 days, I think,
*29:55.200- 29:56.080* :  I could get that going for.
*29:56.940- 29:57.800* :  Stephanie Prentice.
*30:00.000- 30:02.160* :  And that's all from us for now, but before we go,
*30:02.620- 30:05.620* :  here's Jackie with News of the next edition of A Happy Pod.

*30:16.780- 30:20.780* :  We'll hear about the cheetah born in captivity in Australia and living a new life in the
*30:20.780- 30:22.100* :  wild in South Africa.
