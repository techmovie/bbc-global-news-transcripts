*01:25.120- 01:29.540* :  I'm Janet Gillil, and in the early hours of Wednesday the 17th of April, these are our
*01:29.540- 01:30.160* :  main stories.
*01:30.860- 01:36.920* :  The UN says Israel is continuing to impose unlawful restrictions on aid to Gaza, and calls
*01:36.920- 01:40.200* :  on it to do more to stop the escalating violence in the West Bank.
*01:41.120- 01:45.400* :  Belgium's Prime Minister has criticised the decision to shut down a meeting in Brussels
*01:45.400- 01:48.280* :  of hard-wip politicians from across Europe.
*01:49.220- 01:55.000* :  A bill banning anyone who's currently 15 or younger from ever-buying cigarettes has cleared
*01:55.000- 01:58.000* :  its first major hurdle in the British Parliament.
*02:00.740- 02:05.480* :  Also in this podcast, so given the chance this black hole will certainly suck in any material
*02:05.480- 02:09.680* :  that it could get, but at the minute it's not doing that, so it isn't active, and that's
*02:09.680- 02:11.960* :  why we can't see this black hole directly.
*02:12.700- 02:18.660* :  Astronomers have made a surprising discovery, a black hole, not that far from planet Earth,
*02:19.080- 02:22.020* :  the mere 2,000 light years away.
*02:27.580- 02:33.100* :  Until Iran's attack on it last weekend, Israel had been facing increased international
*02:33.140- 02:38.380* :  pressure to allow more food, medicine and other vital supplies into Gaza.
*02:39.280- 02:44.080* :  Now, despite its claims that it is allowing more aid convoys in after repeated warnings
*02:44.080- 02:50.820* :  about a looming famine, the UN says Israel is still preventing urgently needed aid from
*02:50.820- 02:53.540* :  getting into the besieged Palestinian territory.
*02:53.860- 03:00.900* :  The UN Human Rights spokesperson, Israel continues to impose unlawful restrictions on
*03:00.900- 03:05.620* :  the entry and distribution of humanitarian assistance, carry out widespread destruction
*03:05.620- 03:07.640* :  of civilian infrastructure as well.
*03:08.120- 03:12.320* :  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights repeats that there must be an immediate ceasefire,
*03:12.760- 03:17.660* :  the hostages must be released, and full, unfettered humanitarian aid must be allowed
*03:17.660- 03:18.980* :  to flow immediately.
*03:19.500- 03:24.420* :  Those delivering or trying to access humanitarian assistance must never be attacked.
*03:25.700- 03:29.440* :  James Landau in Jerusalem told us more about the UN's accusations.
*03:30.440- 03:35.180* :  This despite the fact that the Israelis have made it very, very clear in all their public
*03:35.180- 03:39.780* :  utterances that they are doing more to get aid in, they said this specifically after
*03:39.780- 03:45.040* :  the killing of the aid workers while back, they promised to open up new crossings, they
*03:45.040- 03:48.840* :  promised to open up the port of Ashtard to get more aid flowing through the north.
*03:49.400- 03:56.920* :  Now, if you talk to NGOs and aid workers on the ground, they say that there is an improvement,
*03:56.920- 03:59.520* :  but it's very modest and it's very moderate.
*04:00.120- 04:05.160* :  And the UN says that it's still having trouble getting access to what they need.
*04:05.580- 04:12.200* :  The situation in Gaza has been overshadowed by this weekend's unprecedented attack by Iran
*04:12.200- 04:12.920* :  on Israel.
*04:13.560- 04:17.160* :  What's the latest on how Israel is planning to respond to that?
*04:17.640- 04:22.460* :  They're still considering their options, they say there will be a response, but two
*04:22.460- 04:29.720* :  things today gave us a suggestion and indication that maybe Israel is thinking of playing this
*04:29.720- 04:33.380* :  longer than expected and that there might not be an imminent response.
*04:33.940- 04:40.620* :  The first thing was an opinion poll that suggested that Israeli public opinion is very divided
*04:41.480- 04:44.740* :  over how and when Israel should respond.
*04:45.300- 04:52.620* :  Almost 50-50, it was actually 52-48 in favour of some kind of response and some saying there
*04:52.620- 04:53.980* :  shouldn't be any response at all.
*04:54.620- 05:01.240* :  And of those who said there should be a military response, about 30 percent of the country
*05:01.240- 05:05.380* :  said there should not be a military response and another that he responds, 30 percent said,
*05:05.980- 05:07.180* :  they just simply didn't know.
*05:07.180- 05:14.060* :  So that was the first indication and that was from, you know, respected here in Jerusalem.
*05:14.580- 05:20.260* :  The other signal we got today was from senior Israeli policymakers, Betty Gantz, member
*05:20.260- 05:26.760* :  of the war cabinet and also the main spokesman for the army, both of whom spoke about the
*05:26.760- 05:31.120* :  need for there to continue to be an alliance against Iran.
*05:31.120- 05:36.880* :  In other words, they were arguing that Iran was not just the enemy of Israel, but the enemy
*05:36.880- 05:43.720* :  of the region of the world and their argument was that the world should stay united with
*05:43.720- 05:45.160* :  Israel against Iran.
*05:45.920- 05:51.340* :  In other words, the suggestion that if and when there is any response to the attack, it
*05:51.340- 05:56.640* :  would be more coordinated, it would be an act of retaliation that kept those allies
*05:57.240- 05:57.900* :  on side.
*05:57.900- 06:03.820* :  And if that is the thinking, then the implication is that Israel will think long and hard
*06:04.480- 06:09.120* :  and be very calibrated about its response to try and keep that alliance together.
*06:09.120- 06:14.500* :  In other words, operationalising the sympathy that it got as a result of the weekend's
*06:14.540- 06:14.740* :  attack.
*06:15.840- 06:16.520* :  James Landel.
*06:17.240- 06:22.020* :  Well, the UN Human Rights Office has also voiced grave concerns about the escalating
*06:22.020- 06:23.880* :  violence in the occupied West Bank.
*06:24.300- 06:29.220* :  Hundreds of Jewish settlers torched Palestinian homes in the West Bank over the weekend, killing
*06:29.220- 06:32.200* :  two people after the murder of an Israeli teenager.
*06:32.880- 06:38.920* :  The UN has accused Israeli security forces of active participation in attacks on Palestinians
*06:38.920- 06:40.100* :  by Jewish settlers.
*06:40.780- 06:43.220* :  Here's our Middle East correspondent, Hugo Buscego.
*06:48.420- 06:53.400* :  In the occupied West Bank, Israeli settlers armed with guns and stones stormed the village
*06:53.400- 06:55.040* :  of Mkhair near Ramallah.
*06:55.780- 07:00.440* :  Houses and cars are set alight and a group of men target Jihad Abu Aliya's house.
*07:01.220- 07:05.080* :  He tries to stop the attack, but is killed with a shot in the chest.
*07:05.720- 07:08.580* :  He was 25 and planning to get married in June.
*07:09.380- 07:11.020* :  This is his cousin, Samir.
*07:12.860- 07:17.140* :  Jihad was trying to prevent the settlers from breaking the house door of Samir House,
*07:17.840- 07:22.560* :  where dozens of the town residents arrived in the home to prevent them from burning the
*07:22.560- 07:22.840* :  house.
*07:23.720- 07:28.920* :  It wasn't the first time settlers attacked us, but we weren't expecting a huge number
*07:28.920- 07:29.520* :  of them.
*07:29.840- 07:33.720* :  They shot at the water tanks, the electricity network and the internet.
*07:34.300- 07:37.100* :  They were planning to isolate us from the outside world.
*07:38.700- 07:43.280* :  The attack on Saturday was part of a rampage by Israeli settlers across the West Bank.
*07:43.920- 07:49.020* :  The violence was sparked by the disappearance of a 14-year-old Israeli teenager, Benjamin
*07:49.020- 07:50.020* :  Ahimeh.
*07:50.720- 07:53.880* :  He were missing on Friday after leaving his Israeli outpost.
*07:54.440- 07:56.220* :  A day later, he was found dead.
*07:57.180- 08:02.720* :  In the village of Da'id-Dibuan, also near Ramallah, CCTV captured a settler setting
*08:02.720- 08:06.620* :  fire on a car under the watch of at least three Israeli soldiers.
*08:07.440- 08:10.240* :  The Israeli military said it was investigating the incident.
*08:11.020- 08:15.700* :  Ziv Stal is the director of Yash Dyn, an Israeli human rights group.
*08:16.080- 08:22.760* :  What we see with the military is basically not falling in their duty to protect Palestinians
*08:22.760- 08:23.760* :  in the West Bank.
*08:24.720- 08:29.660* :  We see them escort the violent settlers, providing them with protection.
*08:30.240- 08:34.020* :  Tensions in the West Bank have escalated since the start of the war in Gaza.
*08:34.500- 08:38.560* :  Amid a rising raids by the Israeli army and violence by Israeli settlers.
*08:39.360- 08:44.440* :  Activists say these attacks and the involvement of the Israeli security forces are rarely
*08:44.440- 08:47.460* :  investigated with impunity virtually the norm.
*08:48.020- 08:48.980* :  Yugo Beshek.
*08:49.960- 08:54.360* :  Belgium's Prime Minister has criticized a decision by a local mayor in Brussels to shut
*08:54.360- 08:57.200* :  down a controversial gathering of hard-right politicians.
*08:57.880- 09:03.000* :  Alexander de Kroes had banning political meetings was unconstitutional and unacceptable.
*09:03.940- 09:08.200* :  Police stopped people from entering the venue where the meeting was taking place, but
*09:08.200- 09:11.160* :  refrained from forcing those who were already there to leave.
*09:11.940- 09:16.660* :  France's far-right former presidential contender, Eric Zimour, was one of those not allowed
*09:16.660- 09:17.180* :  to enter.
*09:17.740- 09:22.360* :  But another attendee, the British Brexit here, Nigel Farage, did manage to go ahead with
*09:22.360- 09:22.920* :  his speech.
*09:23.500- 09:29.140* :  A former British interior minister, Srela Brahman, also took part, and Hungary's Prime Minister
*09:29.140- 09:31.800* :  Victor Orban was scheduled to speak too.
*09:32.600- 09:37.680* :  This all comes as far-right politicians across Europe are expected to do well in EU elections
*09:37.680- 09:39.060* :  due to be held in June.
*09:39.500- 09:42.720* :  From Brussels, our Europe correspondent Nick Beak sent this report.
*09:43.720- 09:46.680* :  A clash of ideologies played out on the streets of Brussels.
*09:47.420- 09:51.560* :  A movement that wants to go global, collided with very local politics.
*09:52.740- 09:58.420* :  To this national conservatism event came a Belgian policeman, armed with a decree from
*09:58.420- 10:03.540* :  the local socialist mayor, instructing the right-wing delegates from across Europe and
*10:03.540- 10:04.860* :  the US to leave.
*10:07.400- 10:11.960* :  The speeches had already got underway, with promises being made to revive traditional
*10:11.960- 10:14.380* :  beliefs and reassert the nation's state.
*10:14.960- 10:16.280* :  Good afternoon, everybody.
*10:16.680- 10:19.900* :  Top of the bill was the former home secretary, Srela Brahman.
*10:20.380- 10:25.780* :  But local officials had decided the views of these speakers could spark public disorder,
*10:25.780- 10:27.820* :  and so ordered the event to stop.
*10:28.480- 10:31.300* :  Nigel Farage was among those condemning the decision.
*10:31.520- 10:32.680* :  It's monstrous.
*10:32.920- 10:33.980* :  Absolutely monstrous.
*10:34.060- 10:38.720* :  You know, a very decent, respectable group of people, members of the European royal family,
*10:38.720- 10:42.680* :  prime ministers, academics, business people, being told they can't have a lot of terms
*10:42.680- 10:43.100* :  of view.
*10:43.560- 10:44.260* :  Thank God the rest.
*10:44.340- 10:47.740* :  Well, can I just ask the local mayor says it's because of fears over anti-abortion, possibly
*10:47.740- 10:50.140* :  anti-gay sentiments held by people in the building?
*10:50.700- 10:51.100* :  Coppers.
*10:51.640- 10:56.740* :  Whether it was suppression of free speech or protecting the public from extremist ideology,
*10:57.280- 10:59.840* :  the police found the compromise of sorts.
*11:00.320- 11:05.440* :  They refused to let any more people into the conference, but did not drag out those already
*11:05.840- 11:05.960* :  inside.
*11:06.700- 11:11.880* :  The ban did mean the far-right French politician, Erich Zermor, was unable to give his speech.
*11:12.320- 11:17.720* :  The spectacle catapulted a gathering of only a few hundred people onto the front pages
*11:17.720- 11:18.740* :  of news websites.
*11:19.420- 11:22.760* :  As one organizer put it, you can't buy publicity like this.
*11:23.560- 11:24.100* :  Nick Beak.
*11:24.520- 11:30.020* :  Police in India say a top-married leader was among at least 29 rebels killed during a major
*11:30.020- 11:31.720* :  gun battle with security forces.
*11:32.300- 11:37.260* :  The shootout in the central state of Chattiskear comes just days before the start of India's
*11:37.280- 11:38.100* :  general election.
*11:38.520- 11:39.660* :  Here's a lecture next, Smith.
*11:40.260- 11:44.840* :  This is possibly one of the biggest insurgent operations carried out in Chattiskear and
*11:44.840- 11:49.160* :  will be seen as a huge success for security forces, not least because among those
*11:49.160- 11:53.000* :  killed is Shankar Rao, a top rebel commander with a bounty on his head.
*11:53.060- 11:57.400* :  The gun battle in what's known as the Red Corridor, followed a tip-off that senior
*11:57.400- 11:59.020* :  Maoist leaders were in the area.
*11:59.380- 12:02.180* :  Police say they've recovered a significant amount of ammunition.
*12:02.760- 12:06.900* :  The far-left radicals have been battling for decades for the rights of the rural poor.
*12:07.140- 12:11.960* :  Norendra Modi's BJP is campaigning in pass on a pledge to eliminate them.
*12:12.960- 12:13.940* :  Electro-Nasemith.
*12:14.440- 12:17.340* :  Astronomers have made a surprising discovery.
*12:17.340- 12:23.240* :  A black hole, not that far from us, just a mere 2,000 or so light years away.
*12:23.760- 12:26.380* :  It's what's known as a stellar black hole.
*12:26.380- 12:30.920* :  That's nothing like as large as a supermassive variety at the centre of our galaxy.
*12:31.560- 12:33.660* :  This is a much smaller category of black hole.
*12:33.740- 12:36.080* :  It comes from a star that is expiring.
*12:36.780- 12:42.500* :  But this one still has 33 times the mass of the sun, so much bigger than your average
*12:42.500- 12:43.480* :  stellar black hole.
*12:43.680- 12:47.340* :  But is it close enough to suck our planet into it?
*12:47.780- 12:52.620* :  Evan Davis spoke to Dr Jenny Millard, an astronomer at Cardiff University, and presenter of the
*12:52.780- 12:54.300* :  Awesome Astronomy Podcast.
*12:55.340- 12:56.760* :  The problem is with black holes.
*12:56.760- 13:00.240* :  We can't see them directly, so there's a couple of ways we find them.
*13:00.620- 13:05.600* :  One is if they've got a disc of gas going around them, it becomes superheated, and then
*13:05.600- 13:09.280* :  that emits light, and so then we can infer the presence of the black hole.
*13:09.700- 13:14.060* :  And the other way is the impact it can have on a companion star, and that's how we found
*13:14.060- 13:14.600* :  this one.
*13:15.040- 13:20.680* :  So Gaia is a survey telescope, and it's mapping the position and motions of billions of stars
*13:20.680- 13:21.480* :  in our galaxy.
*13:22.140- 13:26.780* :  And one of the stars in the constellation of Aquila the Eagle, well, it saw this star wobbling
*13:27.720- 13:27.740* :  unexpectedly.
*13:28.380- 13:35.580* :  And so from that wobbling, we can infer the presence of this 33 suns mass black hole, because
*13:35.580- 13:41.040* :  this black hole is tugging on its companion star as they orbit each other, dancing through
*13:41.180- 13:41.360* :  space.
*13:41.700- 13:43.240* :  So what's the companion star thing?
*13:43.240- 13:47.740* :  Not every black hole has a companion star does, is that a thing?
*13:48.000- 13:51.260* :  Yeah, not every black hole has a companion star, and if they don't have a companion,
*13:51.300- 13:55.420* :  it makes them even more difficult to detect, unless they've got that disc of gas and dust
*13:55.420- 13:56.700* :  around them that's glowing.
*13:57.140- 14:01.580* :  So by having this companion, and interacting with this companion, that's how we've been
*14:01.580- 14:04.740* :  able to discover this 33 suns worth black hole.
*14:05.460- 14:08.680* :  Now, is it still sucking everything around it in?
*14:08.680- 14:13.500* :  We have this vision of black holes as a kind of vacuum that sort of pull everything in
*14:14.340- 14:19.720* :  around, is it still, and is it ever possible that, you know, we come close enough to one
*14:19.720- 14:23.300* :  of these things that they actually affect, affect our little solar system?
*14:24.120- 14:27.740* :  So given the chance, this black hole will certainly suck in any material that it can
*14:27.760- 14:29.600* :  get, but at the minute, it's not doing that.
*14:29.640- 14:33.660* :  So it isn't active, and that's why we can't see this black hole directly.
*14:34.160- 14:37.920* :  But in terms of our safety, we haven't got anything to worry about when it comes to
*14:37.920- 14:42.660* :  this black hole, because it's 2,000 light years away, and 2,000 light years away is well
*14:42.660- 14:44.540* :  beyond the constraints of our solar system.
*14:44.860- 14:48.540* :  There are many, many thousands of stars in between us and this black hole.
*14:48.560- 14:52.640* :  It's just on the scale of our galaxy, which is about 100,000 light years across.
*14:52.640- 14:54.740* :  Well, that's relatively close.
*14:54.740- 14:58.620* :  It's basically in our cosmic backyard, but it poses no threat to us.
*14:59.480- 15:01.600* :  Astronomers, Dr. Jenny Millard.
*15:04.360- 15:04.940* :  Still to come?

*16:36.880- 16:38.440* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*16:39.120- 16:43.360* :  The International Monetary Fund says it expects much stronger growth in the United States
*16:43.360- 16:45.180* :  this year than previously predicted.
*16:45.420- 16:51.680* :  In our forecast growth of 2.7% more than double the rate of any other G7 economy.
*16:52.480- 16:59.680* :  And the global economy is now expected to expand by 3.2% higher than previously estimated.
*17:00.100- 17:06.040* :  But the IMF warns central banks against cutting interest rates to quickly fearing a return
*17:06.160- 17:07.340* :  of high inflation.
*17:08.080- 17:13.100* :  Ed Butler spoke to Muhammad El-Aryan, former deputy director of the IMF and president
*17:13.100- 17:14.640* :  of Queens College, Cambridge.
*17:15.200- 17:19.920* :  So is this forecast by the IMF good news or a mixed picture?
*17:20.700- 17:25.780* :  It is a positive take and it's associated with what the IMF characterizes as surprising
*17:25.780- 17:28.600* :  resilience for the global economy.
*17:29.140- 17:34.240* :  Having said that, they stress that we are likely to see more divergence outcome.
*17:35.440- 17:41.080* :  And the underlying theme is one of the multiple transitions that different countries are going
*17:41.080- 17:42.400* :  to be able to handle differently.
*17:42.840- 17:47.920* :  Yeah, I mean, that means the US is doing pretty well, India is doing pretty well, but lots
*17:47.920- 17:48.980* :  of other places aren't.
*17:49.440- 17:49.680* :  Correct.
*17:50.060- 17:55.340* :  And they express concerns that not only is the average growth rate of these other places
*17:55.340- 18:02.160* :  low, but their fiscal buffers, the ability to absorb any shocks has been run down.
*18:02.740- 18:06.620* :  And they have this notion that we live in a more shock-prone world.
*18:07.300- 18:09.560* :  Can we just look at inflation first of all?
*18:09.560- 18:13.500* :  Because of course, so much of the global conversations been around inflation and interest rates
*18:13.500- 18:14.840* :  over the last couple of years.
*18:15.520- 18:16.800* :  What is that take on that?
*18:16.800- 18:19.020* :  I mean, what are we expecting over the next few months?
*18:19.380- 18:23.940* :  So that take is that inflation has come down faster than expected.
*18:24.020- 18:29.840* :  However, they are starting to recognize what other have recognized, which is labeled
*18:29.840- 18:31.860* :  as a difficulty of the last mile.
*18:32.440- 18:37.420* :  The notion that inflation has now gotten to the state where it is more sticky and is going
*18:37.420- 18:42.440* :  to be harder to bring down to central banks to percent inflation target.
*18:42.460- 18:49.400* :  But they don't take up and I understand why diplomatically they haven't is the key question
*18:49.700- 18:51.600* :  is 2% the world inflation target.
*18:51.800- 18:53.740* :  Yeah, because it's kind of arbitrary one, isn't it?
*18:53.740- 18:54.780* :  We've talked about this before.
*18:54.780- 18:59.940* :  It was set ages ago as somehow, notionally, the best number for inflation.
*19:00.000- 19:02.760* :  But many people think, you know, why two?
*19:02.920- 19:03.700* :  Why not two and a half?
*19:03.700- 19:04.420* :  Why not three?
*19:06.500- 19:06.520* :  Correct.
*19:06.520- 19:07.780* :  It was set in the early 1990s by New Zealand.
*19:08.780- 19:12.240* :  And it was an experiment in what was called inflation targeting.
*19:12.820- 19:14.680* :  The experiment worked well.
*19:15.180- 19:19.180* :  So it was adopted by other countries with very different attributes.
*19:19.980- 19:25.100* :  You know, it is strange that countries that differ in the structure have the same inflation
*19:25.160- 19:25.460* :  target.
*19:25.700- 19:31.020* :  We're talking here of the US, of the Eurozone, of the UK, of New Zealand, of Australia.
*19:31.160- 19:38.220* :  But it became this arbitrary number and it didn't matter because the world was experiencing
*19:38.220- 19:41.620* :  so many positive supply shock that inflation wasn't a problem.
*19:42.240- 19:46.820* :  But now that inflation has become a problem and it's been above target consistently, we
*19:46.820- 19:51.960* :  should be asking the question is that the right target in the world, which is becoming
*19:51.960- 19:58.440* :  more inflexible on the supply side and where fragmentation has replaced globalization.
*19:58.460- 20:03.380* :  OK, well, central banks are going to take different views on what the right level is
*20:03.380- 20:06.160* :  or at least where to set their interest rates to bring inflation down.
*20:06.160- 20:09.460* :  I guess they're all still notionally targeting the 2% figure.
*20:09.900- 20:13.400* :  But what should we be looking out for in terms of the risks?
*20:13.400- 20:17.400* :  I mean, obviously, this is just a forecast, forecasts can be wrong.
*20:18.000- 20:21.100* :  And there's always geopolitical hazards on the horizon on there.
*20:21.280- 20:21.560* :  Correct.
*20:22.300- 20:26.520* :  You know, the IMF has moved to a balanced risk scenario.
*20:27.000- 20:29.480* :  So thinking that the risks out there are balanced.
*20:29.480- 20:35.260* :  I think if they knew then what they know now about the geopolitics, I suspect that the
*20:35.260- 20:38.380* :  balance of risk would not have been balanced would have been to the negative side.
*20:38.640- 20:43.120* :  You mean more escalation in the Middle East, for instance, more escalation, all prices
*20:43.120- 20:48.940* :  going higher, that having a stack, inflation, and we impact, meaning it will undermine growth
*20:48.940- 20:50.200* :  and push up inflation.
*20:50.780- 20:56.880* :  Mohamed El-Aryan, former deputy director of the IMF, Colombia, a country once shunned
*20:56.880- 21:01.600* :  by foreign visitors because of a decade's long internal armed conflict, has become a top
*21:01.600- 21:04.800* :  destination for digital nomads since the pandemic.
*21:05.420- 21:09.760* :  It's brought a welcome financial boost to some locals, but others say they're being
*21:09.760- 21:10.540* :  priced out.
*21:10.840- 21:11.960* :  Catherine Ellis reports.
*21:15.540- 21:23.060* :  Colombia, a country full of music, biodiversity, coffee, and increasingly digital nomads.
*21:24.480- 21:29.600* :  The country has recently soared in popularity with remote workers from around the world wanting
*21:29.600- 21:33.340* :  to enjoy a different way of life while not giving up their incomes.
*21:33.700- 21:36.020* :  Elena Hughes from New Zealand is one of them.
*21:36.580- 21:40.920* :  I wanted to come here and dance more salsa here and just happen to be able to do that
*21:40.920- 21:41.480* :  with my job.
*21:41.960- 21:46.560* :  Rianne Rout, who works for a U.S. ceramics company in New Orleans, says there are many things
*21:46.560- 21:48.260* :  that attracted her to Colombia.
*21:49.020- 21:53.100* :  The culture, the food, the kindness of the people, it's completely different than anything
*21:53.100- 21:54.500* :  that I've experienced in the States.
*21:55.100- 22:00.600* :  Colombia's second biggest city, Medellin, with its leafy suburbs, cable cars, and relatively
*22:00.600- 22:06.040* :  low costs of living, wants to dub the murder capital of the world in the early 90s and
*22:06.040- 22:11.800* :  associated with narcotics trafficking and the infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar has undergone
*22:11.800- 22:13.620* :  a momentous transformation.
*22:15.360- 22:19.020* :  Fruitseller Carlos Acosta says more foreigners means more business.
*22:19.540- 22:24.440* :  Some of them are great customers, good people who buy a lot, things have improved a little
*22:24.440- 22:25.200* :  with these people.
*22:26.620- 22:33.160* :  One study by consultancy firm Breakthrough estimates around 8,300 digital nomads are arriving
*22:33.160- 22:39.100* :  in Medellin each month, helped in part by a renewable two-year digital nomad visa introduced
*22:39.100- 22:40.260* :  in 2022.
*22:42.140- 22:45.620* :  Uber driver Henri Muriel says he's benefited hugely.
*22:46.720- 22:50.260* :  They make up 70% of business for me, these people from abroad.
*22:50.820- 22:54.140* :  The arrival is good because if more arrive, the economy is better.
*22:54.740- 22:59.340* :  But some landlords now prefer to rent to foreigners who are willing to pay more than locals,
*22:59.360- 23:03.760* :  pushing up prices in some areas by as much as 80%.
*23:04.220- 23:07.620* :  When the digital nomads start to come in, the market starts to be more constrained.
*23:08.380- 23:13.320* :  Juan Guillermo Yunder is a professor in urban and regional planning at Colombia's Pontifical
*23:13.360- 23:14.680* :  Javierian University.
*23:15.240- 23:19.140* :  He says that in Medellin, we're seeing a distinct type of gentrification.
*23:19.760- 23:24.780* :  It's more a super gentrification that is not displacing the lower income population
*23:24.780- 23:27.260* :  as happens in cities in the United States and Europe.
*23:27.580- 23:32.200* :  What is displacing more kind of middle-oper income families that traditionally used to
*23:32.200- 23:32.920* :  live in this areas?
*23:33.520- 23:39.280* :  Cristina Guerrero has been looking for a new home for weeks without any luck.
*23:40.340- 23:43.820* :  The rent here in Medellin has increased exponentially.
*23:43.820- 23:50.220* :  Sometimes there are apartments that you see and say, no, this isn't worth that much.
*23:50.840- 23:56.020* :  Despite rising rents, Medellin and Colombia has gone from no-go zone to one of the most
*23:56.020- 24:01.800* :  desirable digital nomad destinations in the world, drawing in people like Brienne Route.
*24:02.440- 24:05.700* :  I am absolutely in love with the mountains, the beaches, the hot the coal.
*24:05.700- 24:07.500* :  It has absolutely everything to offer.
*24:08.060- 24:10.840* :  Brienne says she's not planning on leaving anytime soon.
*24:11.100- 24:15.040* :  Given the digital nomad visa is renewable, she might not have to.
*24:16.100- 24:17.860* :  That report by Catherine Ellis.
*24:18.780- 24:24.380* :  A fierce regional storm that's killed 18 people has caused chaos at Dubai Airport, the
*24:24.380- 24:25.940* :  world's second busiest.
*24:26.500- 24:31.100* :  An airport spokesman said all incoming flights on Tuesday evening were being diverted due
*24:31.100- 24:32.400* :  to widespread flooding.
*24:32.600- 24:35.340* :  Here's our Middle East regional editor, Mike Thompson.
*24:36.040- 24:41.620* :  The Gulf region, usually known for its hot and arid climate, has been lashed by high winds
*24:41.620- 24:43.020* :  and torrential rains.
*24:43.020- 24:48.760* :  The storm first passed over a mile where floods cut off roads and swept away cars, killing
*24:48.760- 24:51.160* :  18 people, many of them children.
*24:51.580- 24:57.540* :  Bahrain was also hit, and some inland areas of the UAE saw nearly 80 percent of an average
*24:57.540- 25:00.060* :  year's rainfall in just 24 hours.
*25:00.500- 25:06.060* :  It's around Dubai Airport remain flooded with arriving passengers advised to use public
*25:06.060- 25:09.140* :  transport and incoming flights diverted.
*25:10.080- 25:13.860* :  Mike Thompson British members of parliament have overwhelmingly
*25:13.860- 25:19.600* :  backed plans to ban anyone born after 2009 from ever buying cigarettes.
*25:20.200- 25:23.920* :  The proposals are among the strictest anti-smoking measures in the world.
*25:24.340- 25:28.340* :  They also include restrictions designed to make vapes less appealing to children.
*25:28.800- 25:33.420* :  The bill was championed by the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, but his predecessor, Liz Truss,
*25:33.420- 25:38.480* :  was among more than 60 members of parliament who voted against it, arguing the law would
*25:38.480- 25:39.760* :  limit personal freedom.
*25:40.440- 25:51.280* :  My real fear is that this is not the final stage that the health police want to push.
*25:53.220- 25:54.240* :  They are the health police.
*25:55.940- 25:58.900* :  They are the health police and people are concerned about this.
*25:59.960- 26:06.740* :  They want to be able to make their own decisions about what they eat, what they drink and how
*26:07.400- 26:08.340* :  they enjoy themselves.
*26:09.420- 26:12.120* :  Our UK political affairs correspondent is Rob Watson.
*26:12.120- 26:15.780* :  He told Tim Franks more about this groundbreaking legislation.
*26:16.480- 26:20.580* :  You've got two stories here Tim, you've got a domestic British political story which will
*26:20.580- 26:21.640* :  come on to in a second.
*26:22.140- 26:27.100* :  But I think probably more enduring will be the global health story in one suspect that
*26:27.500- 26:33.500* :  long after Rishi Sunak has gone, what Britain is doing here with this law, which is being
*26:33.500- 26:38.280* :  very closely watched around the world, will be what will endure because essentially Britain
*26:38.280- 26:44.200* :  is instigating a plan to try and make the country smoke-free that if you like is more radical
*26:44.740- 26:47.580* :  than anything that's being tried anywhere else in the world.
*26:48.480- 26:56.200* :  I mean the advocates of this measure are saying, look the point is here, it's not really
*26:56.200- 27:01.640* :  about choice because smoking is an addiction but also there are no safe levels of smoking.
*27:02.540- 27:08.200* :  Yes, I mean the advocates are saying exactly that, it's not choice if you've become addicted
*27:08.200- 27:11.120* :  at an early age and you're just so desperate to stop it.
*27:11.520- 27:15.980* :  And they're also making a if you like a sort of logistical argument which is that in Britain
*27:16.980- 27:22.760* :  smoking causes the largest number of preventable deaths, 80,000 a year and that it's also
*27:23.080- 27:26.420* :  immensely costly, costing over 20 billion dollars.
*27:26.420- 27:30.640* :  So they're saying it's a sort of a no-brainer in practical terms and that you're going
*27:30.640- 27:32.900* :  to have to get that one way or another.
*27:33.300- 27:35.360* :  Tell us about the politics of this vote then Rob.
*27:36.240- 27:40.820* :  As I say I do think Tim that the kind of global health issue will be what resonates long
*27:40.820- 27:45.560* :  beyond Mr. Sunak leaving office but absolutely there is of course this issue within the governing
*27:45.560- 27:50.220* :  conservative party where you are, I'm not going to call them a libertarian rump because there's
*27:50.220- 27:55.160* :  obviously quite a lot of them, something like nearly 60 voted against it, you just think
*27:55.160- 28:00.220* :  look it's not up to the state to be telling people how to live their lives and even though
*28:00.220- 28:05.060* :  many of them argued smoking as we don't want to see young people smoking, but where will
*28:05.060- 28:05.540* :  it end?
*28:05.600- 28:09.460* :  I mean will the state start telling people how much alcohol they could drink, how many
*28:09.820- 28:13.440* :  carats they should eat, how many vegetables they should have.
*28:13.860- 28:18.980* :  And so that was argued very, very powerfully, as long as the other objection to it which
*28:18.980- 28:24.220* :  is how practical would it be, I mean how are you going to distinguish in 20 years time from
*28:24.220- 28:31.920* :  someone who was born in 2008 and 2009, but again the polling here suggests that the vast majority
*28:31.920- 28:37.760* :  of voters are in favour of this, including interestingly conservative voters, people who
*28:37.760- 28:43.200* :  voted conservative in 2019, so the idea that there's a sort of a libertarian base of
*28:43.200- 28:47.800* :  voters that conservatives can tap into, I mean the evidence suggests that it isn't there,
*28:47.800- 28:52.820* :  but I guess once again it's a reminder of the dramas within the governing conservative
*28:52.820- 28:58.300* :  party, although again I get the sort of sense to him that outside of Westminster an awful
*28:58.300- 29:03.260* :  lot of voters have just sort of switched off from the internal conservative dramas and they're
*29:03.260- 29:06.900* :  just thinking, oh right, yeah there's going to be a smoking ban, I wonder how that's
*29:06.900- 29:07.420* :  going to work.
*29:08.060- 29:08.580* :  Rob Watson.
*29:09.360- 29:13.940* :  Now to Denmark and as we heard in the earlier podcast one of Copenhagen's oldest buildings
*29:13.940- 29:16.840* :  its former stock exchange has been engulfed by fire.
*29:17.260- 29:21.980* :  It took firefighters hours on Tuesday to control the flames, members of the public rushed
*29:21.980- 29:24.480* :  to rescue some of the historic paintings inside.
*29:25.020- 29:29.600* :  The fire has been compared to the one at Notre Dame in Paris five years ago, as the old
*29:29.600- 29:35.340* :  stock exchange was in the middle of being renovated and its iconic fire collapsed into the scaffolding.
*29:35.900- 29:40.140* :  The mayor of Copenhagen, Sophie Hestorp, said it was a sad day for Denmark.
*29:43.300- 29:49.100* :  It's terrible, it's terrible, I can't put into words what the stock exchange means for
*29:49.100- 29:52.260* :  us as a building and a symbol for Copenhagen.
*29:52.920- 29:59.060* :  The four dragons are a part of our skyline and a lot of people from Copenhagen cycle past
*29:59.060- 30:01.020* :  it or walk past it every day.
*30:01.660- 30:06.960* :  The stock exchange is a part of their awareness living in and around the area of the city.
*30:07.760- 30:14.100* :  In that way it's a 400 year old cultural history that has been lost not only in Copenhagen
*30:14.100- 30:15.720* :  but also in Denmark.
*30:17.580- 30:21.380* :  Sorry and Larsson is reporter for Denmark's National Broadcaster DR.
*30:22.000- 30:23.320* :  He spoke to us from the scene.
*30:23.320- 30:29.980* :  They are still curing water over the building like two firefighters on each side are maybe
*30:29.980- 30:35.320* :  in 20-30 meters up with lifts and they're still curing water over the site but this building
*30:35.320- 30:38.960* :  that's once was and is not there anymore.
*30:38.960- 30:44.640* :  The crowd is still being kept away because this happened in the middle of Copenhagen,
*30:44.640- 30:47.320* :  in the middle of the parliament of Copenhagen.
*30:47.800- 30:49.420* :  Do we have any idea what the cause was?
*30:49.840- 30:55.480* :  We don't know what the cause was yet but what we know was that it was under construction
*30:55.600- 31:00.240* :  and it's been under reconstruction for more than a year because this year the building
*31:00.240- 31:06.460* :  was turning 400 years and it was a historical site which was being restored.
*31:06.460- 31:12.520* :  There was a party about going on later on this year where they were like having a huge
*31:12.520- 31:17.420* :  celebration of this building and what it has meant to Copenhagen and to Denmark.
*31:17.660- 31:20.600* :  The police haven't even been inside the building yet.
*31:21.040- 31:24.040* :  The fire is still going on and the firefighters are still working.
*31:24.040- 31:29.260* :  We don't know actually what happened and it comes almost five years of the day since
*31:29.260- 31:34.680* :  that awful fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris many people making comparisons between
*31:34.680- 31:35.460* :  the two disasters.
*31:35.860- 31:40.600* :  Of course it reminds us of what happened in Paris because everyone in Denmark knows about
*31:40.600- 31:45.420* :  this building and I'm quite sure that every tourist who have been to Copenhagen, who
*31:45.420- 31:49.020* :  have been on a guided tour, who have been sailing through the canals, they have seen this
*31:49.020- 31:53.400* :  building because this was one of the buildings we are very fond of.
*31:53.520- 31:54.720* :  We are very proud of Denmark.
*31:55.260- 31:55.820* :  It means a lot.
*31:56.060- 32:00.760* :  Everyone in Denmark knew this building and I don't know if they were proud of it but they
*32:00.760- 32:04.860* :  knew about it and knew about the historical meaning of Copenhagen.
*32:04.860- 32:07.660* :  This was the year the trade in Denmark began.
*32:07.660- 32:10.160* :  It is next to the Copenhagen harbor.
*32:10.580- 32:16.180* :  Denmark is an installation surrounded by water and it was here the trade out of and trade
*32:16.220- 32:20.080* :  in Copenhagen started and that is what was done today.
*32:20.460- 32:25.820* :  Here in Larson, France has long been revered as the home of Hote Quasine.
*32:27.280- 32:32.940* :  Ah Paris France, home of the finest restaurants and the greatest chefs in the world.
*32:35.240- 32:37.020* :  Oh my life I've wanted to be one of them.
*32:37.480- 32:39.960* :  You may think that's a strange dream for a rat.
*32:40.500- 32:46.120* :  In the 2007 film Ratchet-O-E, Remi the Rat aspires to be a famous French chef to ascend
*32:46.120- 32:50.940* :  to what he and much of the world sees as a pinnacle of global gastronomy.
*32:51.500- 32:55.860* :  But in the past couple of decades the reality hasn't always lived up to the myth.
*32:56.380- 33:01.000* :  France has been slipping down the league tables in international cooking contests and restaurant
*33:01.000- 33:01.460* :  ratings.
*33:02.320- 33:07.760* :  Now the French government has decided to swallow its pride and send up and coming young chefs
*33:07.760- 33:10.620* :  abroad to pick up new ideas and techniques.
*33:11.360- 33:15.920* :  I asked the Paris correspondent at the Times newspaper David Chazanne why French cooking
*33:15.920- 33:19.380* :  is no longer so revered as it once was.
*33:20.180- 33:25.800* :  Well some French chefs appear to have grown a little bit complacent, have been resting
*33:25.800- 33:31.540* :  on their laurels and haven't really kept pace with improving standards in other parts
*33:31.540- 33:37.660* :  of the world, in Asia, in Scandinavia, also in Spain and Peru for example.
*33:38.300- 33:43.160* :  So there's a sense that France has remained at the same level while standards have been
*33:43.160- 33:48.180* :  rising in the rest of the world and perhaps that France has even declined.
*33:49.020- 33:55.660* :  And at the same time fast food has got a lot more popular in France, which is now McDonald's
*33:55.660- 33:58.320* :  second biggest market after the US.
*33:59.380- 34:05.060* :  Despite all of that, the notion that France is the world leader in food and wine is hard
*34:05.060- 34:07.120* :  wired into the national DNA.
*34:07.860- 34:14.740* :  So seeing other countries win the accolades, not France, is a severe blow to the nation's
*34:14.740- 34:17.800* :  prestige and to its international influence.
*34:18.500- 34:24.620* :  But this isn't just about soft power, it's also a question of hard cash because France
*34:24.620- 34:31.240* :  is one of the world's top tourist destinations and visitors expect French food to live
*34:31.240- 34:36.160* :  up to its reputation so the government wants French chefs to up there again.
*34:36.420- 34:41.500* :  So how is the government planning to restore French quizzing to its former eminence?
*34:42.460- 34:48.240* :  Well it's reluctantly concluded that the only way to do it is to open up more to foreign
*34:49.100- 34:49.120* :  influencers.
*34:49.860- 34:55.740* :  So it's going to sponsor talented young chefs to go abroad, study what's happening in
*34:55.740- 34:59.260* :  other countries and bring the lessons back home.
*34:59.680- 35:04.840* :  So the government's going to set up a new culinary academy that will sponsor exchange
*35:04.840- 35:08.660* :  programs with training schools in other countries.
*35:09.640- 35:10.640* :  David Chazan.
*35:13.280- 35:17.080* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
