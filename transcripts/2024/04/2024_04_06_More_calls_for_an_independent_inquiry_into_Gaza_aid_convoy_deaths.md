*01:23.840- 01:26.100* :  I'm Andrew Peach, and in the early hours of Saturday,
*01:26.100- 01:28.540* :  the 6th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:29.180- 01:34.780* :  Aid organisations want an independent investigation into the deadly drone strike on an aid convoy,
*01:35.100- 01:38.720* :  after the Israeli Defence Forces published their first account of what happened.
*01:39.440- 01:44.020* :  Thousands of people in the city of Orsk and the Russian Urals are evacuated after a breach
*01:44.020- 01:50.060* :  of their river embankment. Facebook and Meta sell their label AI-generated content on their sites.
*01:52.440- 01:56.020* :  Also in this podcast, the dog from California who turned up in Michigan.
*01:56.440- 02:00.780* :  She jumped out of the car seat into the window and just basically in their arms and she knew
*02:01.160- 02:03.280* :  exactly who we were and it was wonderful.
*02:06.220- 02:10.940* :  First, the aid organisation World Central Kitchen has dismissed an Israeli report into the
*02:10.940- 02:16.380* :  killing of its workers in Gaza on Monday as cold comfort and demanded an independent investigation.
*02:16.380- 02:21.340* :  Its calls been repeated by the families of those killed in the Israeli drone strike on an
*02:21.340- 02:27.240* :  aid convoy. Israel says its dismissed two senior officers involved and punished others after
*02:27.240- 02:32.680* :  finding serious errors. The Israel Defence Forces investigation found there been a series of
*02:32.680- 02:36.620* :  errors leading up to the air strike on three vehicles operated by the charity.
*02:37.180- 02:40.920* :  The report said an aid worker had been mistaken for a Hamas government.
*02:40.920- 02:45.420* :  It also said after an initial strike two more were launched at other vehicles
*02:45.420- 02:51.300* :  for what it called no real reason. Our correspondent Lucy Williamson reports from Jerusalem.
*02:51.800- 02:56.960* :  The errors and assumptions build layer on layer in the army's narrative of Monday night.
*02:57.660- 03:03.660* :  The coordinated route that wasn't communicated to troops, the charity logo that wasn't visible at
*03:04.680- 03:09.660* :  night. The untested assumptions that caused what the IDF calls a grave mistake.
*03:10.760- 03:15.740* :  The airstrikes that pounded the World Central Kitchen convoy as it returned from an aid warehouse
*03:15.740- 03:22.720* :  were called in after forces mistook a bag one passenger was carrying for a gun. Peter Lerner,
*03:22.720- 03:29.120* :  an IDF spokesman, said the mistake happened shortly after gunmen had been spotted, arriving and
*03:29.120- 03:34.540* :  leaving the warehouse in other vehicles. It was a visual confirmation of a gunman,
*03:34.540- 03:40.100* :  first of all, on one of the trucks that then conducted shooting from one of the trucks and when
*03:40.100- 03:46.920* :  they indeed reached the hangars there were more gunmen identified on the location and it led
*03:46.920- 03:54.440* :  basically to the entire miscalculation, misidentification and the failure of what should have happened.
*03:55.000- 04:00.300* :  The army has fired two senior officers who approved the strikes, but World Central Kitchen has
*04:00.300- 04:06.720* :  called for an independent inquiry, saying the IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure
*04:06.720- 04:14.020* :  and that systemic change was needed. The Secretary-General of Medsansol Frontier, Christopher Lockier,
*04:14.020- 04:21.680* :  rejected claims that this was a tragic mistake. This is not just an incident. This is a series,
*04:21.680- 04:26.800* :  a pattern of incidents that have been going on for months and months now. We're now up to
*04:27.500- 04:33.580* :  the stage of having 200 humanitarian workers killed. We are operating in an environment of complete
*04:33.580- 04:38.540* :  impunity. It is a deliberate choice to allow these attacks to continue to happen.
*04:39.380- 04:44.500* :  One former Major-General, Giorer Island, says Israeli forces have also killed their own
*04:44.500- 04:50.200* :  compatriots by mistake. This is a huge mistake. Unfortunately, many, many other mistakes were made,
*04:50.200- 04:55.100* :  for instance, Israel killed three Israeli hostages that managed to release themselves
*04:55.760- 04:59.500* :  and, nevertheless, they were killed by Israeli soldiers and, of course, no one
*04:59.500- 05:06.220* :  believed that we killed them deliberately. Israel says its war is with Hamas, not Gaza's
*05:06.220- 05:13.120* :  civilians, that it's fighting one and feeding the other. But aid workers accuse Israel of seeing
*05:13.120- 05:20.500* :  them as targets and aid as a weapon of war. Under pressure from the U.S. President Joe Biden,
*05:20.500- 05:24.940* :  Israel has promised to open up three crossings into Gaza to let more aid in.
*05:25.340- 05:29.260* :  The U.N. Secretary-General has welcomed the move, but said it had to be quick.
*05:29.520- 05:33.520* :  The U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, said Washington would be monitoring how many
*05:33.520- 05:38.320* :  trucks carrying aid were getting into Gaza. Here's our diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams.
*05:39.140- 05:44.260* :  After months of cajoling, the disastrous events of Monday night and a tense phone call between
*05:44.260- 05:50.440* :  Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel seems poised to take steps which could significantly improve
*05:50.440- 05:56.220* :  the supply of humanitarian assistance. For the first time since November, the container port at
*05:56.220- 06:02.340* :  Ash Dodd will once again be open for shipments of aid or be it on a temporary basis. This should
*06:02.340- 06:07.360* :  allow for much larger quantities to be imported, reducing the need for air drops and the
*06:07.360- 06:13.100* :  makeshift pier recently constructed near Gaza City. Israel also says it will open the major
*06:13.100- 06:20.060* :  crossing point at Erres, attacked and ransacked by Hamas Gunman on October 7. Erres is designed for
*06:20.060- 06:25.780* :  passengers not freight, but it offers direct access into northern Gaza. The U.S. Secretary of State
*06:25.780- 06:31.560* :  Anthony Blinken welcomed the news. These are positive developments, but the real test is results.
*06:32.480- 06:36.180* :  And that's what we're looking to see in the coming days and in the coming weeks.
*06:37.120- 06:42.880* :  And some of the measures that we're looking to include things like the number of trucks that
*06:42.880- 06:47.440* :  are actually getting in on a sustained basis and get not just getting in, but then getting around.
*06:47.960- 06:53.680* :  Aid agencies say anything that gets more aid in is welcome, but after almost six months of war
*06:53.680- 06:58.880* :  an elaborate system of humanitarian assistance throughout the Gaza Strip is on its knees,
*06:58.880- 07:05.900* :  especially in the north where conditions are increasingly dire. Scott Paul of Oxfam America said
*07:05.900- 07:11.880* :  it's not just about food. The kind of humanitarian assistance that's needed to manage and mitigate
*07:11.880- 07:17.680* :  and bring people back from a famine in northern Gaza is not flooding the zone with food. It's
*07:17.680- 07:22.760* :  flooding the zone with people and medicine and medical supplies. And that requires a kind of
*07:22.760- 07:27.360* :  operating environment that we are nowhere close to having right now. Opening the gates to Gaza is
*07:27.360- 07:33.580* :  one thing that crucial operating environment whose fragility was so cruelly exposed on Monday night
*07:33.580- 07:39.320* :  is another. There are growing signs that Monday's attack on the world's central kitchen convoy may
*07:39.320- 07:44.560* :  prove to be a pivotal moment in Israel's war with Hamas. This assessment from our international
*07:44.560- 07:50.180* :  editor Jeremy Bowen. For the first time in this war, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*07:50.640- 07:56.220* :  seems to have listened to Joe Biden. He put enough pressure on Mr Netanyahu during their conference
*07:56.220- 08:02.940* :  called last night to extract unusually rapid concessions from the Israelis. Perhaps he threatened
*08:02.940- 08:09.020* :  to attach conditions to the use of American weapons in Gaza. The killing of the team from the
*08:09.020- 08:15.460* :  world's central kitchen seems to have been a tipping point for President Biden. It is too soon
*08:15.460- 08:20.940* :  to say whether this is a turning point in the war. Israel's critics say the attack on the aid
*08:20.940- 08:27.860* :  workers was not an isolated incident but the result of an ingrained disregard for the lives of
*08:27.860- 08:34.720* :  Palestinian civilians. Any change in Israel's conduct can be measured by the numbers of Palestinian
*08:34.720- 08:42.440* :  civilians killed by its military or by the famine created by Israel's siege. Another test
*08:42.440- 08:48.880* :  will be whether Mr Netanyahu goes ahead with a ground assault on Raffa despite America's opposition.
*08:49.860- 08:54.840* :  Now to other news, officials in the Russian Ural say thousands of people are being evacuated
*08:55.220- 08:59.940* :  after a section of an embankment down burst in a major city. Here's Sasha Schlikter.
*09:00.580- 09:06.520* :  Video posted online shows an angry torrent of water gushing through a breach in a low-slung
*09:06.520- 09:12.720* :  earthen dam on the shore of the Ural River in Orsk. The city streets are flooded. People are
*09:12.720- 09:17.640* :  moving around in boats and dinghies. It's slated night there but heavy earth-moving
*09:17.640- 09:23.540* :  machineries onsite trying to shore up the dam. Earlier an emergency was declared across the
*09:23.540- 09:30.160* :  entire Orenborg region after river levels rose dangerously due to melting ice. Officials say
*09:30.160- 09:36.520* :  10,000 residents may be in the flooding zone. The evacuees are being moved to nearby schools.
*09:37.580- 09:41.520* :  Ukraine has carried out a series of drone attacks on targets in southern Russia.
*09:42.120- 09:46.860* :  Security sources said at least six Russian military planes were destroyed on Thursday.
*09:47.420- 09:51.380* :  Another eight were badly damaged in several military sites around the Rostov region.
*09:51.960- 09:56.060* :  Key of drone attacks have become an increasingly important part of its defenses against
*09:56.060- 10:01.900* :  Moscow forces, as Nikki Cardwell explains. The Ukrainian army has been quite open about its
*10:01.900- 10:06.660* :  development and use of drones, but the program has only recently begun to pay off.
*10:07.260- 10:12.020* :  Three days ago two drones hit targets more than 1,000 kilometers inside Russia.
*10:12.600- 10:17.000* :  It was the furthest that Ukraine has ever been able to attack inside Russian territory.
*10:17.720- 10:21.560* :  Ukraine is now claiming to have destroyed six Russian military planes
*10:21.580- 10:27.540* :  bombed on the ground at their bases. The smallest drones used by the Ukrainian army are
*10:27.540- 10:33.720* :  video-piloted known as FPV drones. Small and quick, they don't have a huge range,
*10:33.720- 10:39.860* :  they're used in kamikaze missions where they dive bomb targets and self-destruct or to drop
*10:39.860- 10:46.180* :  explosives. Many of these are built by volunteers like Bill Smith, an engineer from the United States
*10:46.180- 10:52.280* :  who runs a 3D printer factory in Ukraine. Someone in the military is looking to make drones. They
*10:52.280- 10:58.360* :  send the digital file to this intermediate website and there's something like 1800 printers
*10:58.360- 11:03.560* :  all over Ukraine with these like a printer on their kitchen table and so they'll go on the
*11:03.560- 11:08.000* :  Grammy site and they'll say, okay, I'll do 10 of these or 100 of those and they'll take the
*11:08.000- 11:12.560* :  file and put it into their printers, print it and then send it back to the Academy.
*11:12.740- 11:17.800* :  Sea Baby drones are the aquatic vehicles which have been used to attack Russia's Black Sea fleet
*11:17.800- 11:23.860* :  at the beginning of March. A sea baby reportedly sank a Russian warship. The first wave of these
*11:23.860- 11:29.860* :  drones was crowdfunded. This woman who wishes to remain anonymous has donated thousands to the
*11:29.860- 11:35.900* :  program. I was fortunate enough to actually be invited to go to Ukraine. I spent around about 12
*11:35.900- 11:41.520* :  hours speaking to the soldiers that were headed to the frontline. So there was a really clear
*11:41.520- 11:46.300* :  understanding around how important it was for the drone technology because that means that the
*11:46.300- 11:51.600* :  soldiers can be a little bit further back. They can use that drone, rather than sending in people.
*11:51.860- 11:57.080* :  In recent months, Ukraine has stepped up its drone attacks on Russian territory, targeting both
*11:57.080- 12:02.840* :  military sites and energy facilities in an attempt to knock out the fuel and equipment supplies
*12:02.840- 12:07.820* :  used by Russia for the invasion. With its troops on the ground on the defensive,
*12:08.360- 12:12.960* :  Kiev will be hoping that its drone army can help swing things back in their favor.
*12:13.860- 12:18.520* :  On Friday, the southern Ukrainian city of Zaferizia came under a massive deadly Russian rocket
*12:18.520- 12:25.860* :  attack. Three people were killed, 13 wounded, four of them seriously. Zimbabwe where people largely
*12:25.860- 12:32.420* :  use US dollars for transactions is pinning its hopes on a new currency, the Zimbabwe gold or ZIG.
*12:32.760- 12:36.980* :  It'll be backed by the country's gold reserves and people now have a couple of weeks to hand in
*12:36.980- 12:42.140* :  their old banknotes. Previous attempts to stabilize the local currency, though, haven't been a
*12:42.140- 12:47.680* :  success. Here's our correspondent, Xing'ai Nyokka. It's a currency that comes with a new name,
*12:47.680- 12:55.620* :  as well as new notes and coins, denominated in value from about a quarter of a ZIG. And that's
*12:55.620- 13:03.080* :  the new name, the Zimbabwe gold to about $200. And it also comes with a new exchange rate starting
*13:03.080- 13:09.880* :  at $13.5 to one US dollar. So essentially, what the central bank has done is removed lots of
*13:09.880- 13:17.000* :  zeros from the Zimbabwe dollar, which they have laid to rest. And so the currency value has been
*13:17.000- 13:23.000* :  slashed. It's a currency that will float according to the market-related exchange rate. According to
*13:23.000- 13:28.600* :  the central bank, it'll be backed by precious minerals, mainly gold, as well as foreign currency
*13:28.600- 13:34.340* :  reserves. And so it's being introduced with immediate effect. But Zimbabweans have about three
*13:34.340- 13:39.720* :  weeks to surrender the old currency. And banks and businesses have about seven days to begin
*13:39.720- 13:46.620* :  using this currency. Okay. And why is Zimbabwe repeatedly in this situation of extraordinary
*13:47.360- 13:51.660* :  inflation and therefore the need to do something to write the currency?
*13:52.080- 13:57.080* :  Well, essentially, I think it's because there's this tug of war between what the government wants
*13:57.200- 14:05.540* :  and what the people want. You might remember in 2007, about 17 to 20 years ago, there was a
*14:05.540- 14:12.300* :  local currency that was hit by inflation. And so people just off their own accord started using
*14:12.300- 14:19.220* :  the US dollar. And what happened is that the government was then forced to abandon that Zimbabwe
*14:19.220- 14:24.440* :  dollar, which at some point I think the inflation was over a billion percent. In other words,
*14:24.440- 14:29.900* :  it's never worked before. You end up with the big inflation on the Zimbabwean currency and then
*14:29.900- 14:33.980* :  the flight to the US dollar for any important transactions. Why is it more likely to work now?
*14:34.600- 14:39.340* :  Well, that's not clear. And there's a lot of skepticism on the street. And just as an illustration
*14:39.340- 14:44.660* :  of that, when we heard the news that there was going to be this new currency or this new statement,
*14:44.660- 14:50.880* :  there was an incredible run on the bank. So there were long, long lines of people waiting to withdraw
*14:51.460- 14:55.100* :  whatever money that they could because they weren't sure what the government was going to do.
*14:55.600- 14:59.800* :  And so now that they've announced that this new currency will be different, that it'll be backed
*14:59.800- 15:05.000* :  by gold and it'll also be backed by foreign exchange, which is something that they really haven't
*15:05.000- 15:10.160* :  done before. We haven't really had a gold backed currency. So they're hoping that that will increase
*15:10.160- 15:15.380* :  confidence. And there's been an admission by the central bank that it's only when there's
*15:15.380- 15:20.700* :  confidence that you can have a stable currency. But we've heard all of this before. This is the fifth
*15:21.020- 15:28.000* :  time in the last 17 or so years that Zimbabwe has introduced a new currency. And all of those times
*15:28.000- 15:32.560* :  it's crashed because people simply don't want to hold onto it. They prefer to have the comfort
*15:32.560- 15:38.360* :  of a stable US dollar. Of course, one thing Shingha and Yoko with me. From next month, Facebook and
*15:38.360- 15:44.980* :  Instagram will apply made with AI labels to artificially generated videos, images and audio.
*15:45.600- 15:50.020* :  The change comes ahead of the US election in November, which is poised to test meta-sability
*15:50.020- 15:56.000* :  to police deceptive content generated by AI technology on its platforms. Here's Chris Valance.
*15:56.540- 16:00.820* :  Metters' new rules mean that artificial intelligence generated or altered content in posts
*16:01.180- 16:06.200* :  will stay up in the interests of free speech, but will be clearly labeled as made with AI.
*16:06.960- 16:11.820* :  Only if the content breaks its existing policies such as on hate speech or voter interference
*16:11.820- 16:17.280* :  will it be removed. Metters admitted that its previous rules were too narrow as they only covered
*16:17.280- 16:22.660* :  videos and only content which made someone appear to say something they didn't. The new policy
*16:22.660- 16:27.920* :  was welcomed by the oversight board which called for the changes. Staying with artificial
*16:27.920- 16:34.520* :  intelligence, voice cloning is becoming easier, faster and more convincing. It's possible using AI
*16:34.520- 16:40.640* :  to change the age of an actor's voice, translate into any language or replace a voice lost
*16:40.640- 16:46.460* :  through illness, but it's also increasingly being used by criminals to impersonate a loved one,
*16:46.460- 16:51.880* :  extort money or compromise bank accounts. It's changing how we communicate as Nicholas
*16:52.080- 16:52.940* :  Dambridge reports.
*16:57.840- 17:03.660* :  Respeacher is a Ukrainian AI company. At the forefront of cloning speech that's indistinguishable
*17:03.660- 17:09.220* :  from a human voice, much of its work carried on in bomb shelters during the Russian invasion.
*17:09.840- 17:15.160* :  They've worked on Disney's Obi-Wan Kenobi cloning James L. Jones's voice for Darth Vader.
*17:16.900- 17:24.220* :  Alex Serdiuk is Respeacher's CEO and founder. How close to real-time conversations are we?
*17:24.820- 17:31.220* :  We are there, I would say. We have a piece of technology that allows change in real time,
*17:31.220- 17:38.760* :  meaning a very small delay, several hundred milliseconds that would make it quite smooth for
*17:39.120- 17:46.180* :  a phone conversation. So we can change our voice on a fly at the moment. We applied our real-time
*17:46.180- 17:52.500* :  models, wonderful technology for healthcare. A good example would be their injectomy patients,
*17:52.500- 17:57.660* :  those are mostly people who went through a throat cancer and their vocal box been removed.
*17:57.980- 18:04.240* :  The challenge we have is to make the technology controllable and make sure that bad players
*18:04.240- 18:10.760* :  are not ruining the market. Some irresponsible companies reveal the technology
*18:10.760- 18:17.860* :  plate in anyone, create anyone's voice within seconds with the quality that would trick people.
*18:18.760- 18:23.940* :  Last year Jennifer D. Stefano told the US Senate Judiciary Committee about a frightening
*18:23.940- 18:28.160* :  anonymous phone call she thought was a call for help from her daughter.
*18:28.500- 18:33.460* :  Mom, these bad men have me. Help me help me. She begged and pleaded as a phone was taken from her.
*18:33.460- 18:39.320* :  A threatening and vulgar man took the call over. Listen here, I have your daughter. You call
*18:39.320- 18:43.020* :  anybody you call the police. I'm going to pop her stomach so full of drugs. I'm going to have my
*18:43.020- 18:45.880* :  way with her. I'm going to drop her in Mexico and you'll never see your daughter again.
*18:46.600- 18:51.840* :  A friend called 911, which warned Jennifer there was a scam involving voice cloning.
*18:52.220- 18:57.520* :  But I didn't process that. It wasn't just her voice. It was her cries. It was her sob.
*18:57.760- 19:02.900* :  Professor Brent Middlestard from the Oxford Internet Institute specializes in AI ethics,
*19:02.900- 19:09.240* :  law and policy. There are a number of proposals in the US to basically fight
*19:09.260- 19:19.120* :  robo calls or scam calls or fraud calls. America is further ahead. The AI Act is a new regulatory
*19:19.120- 19:25.640* :  framework that has recently been passed in the European Union. There is political will,
*19:25.640- 19:31.420* :  whereas in the UK, there is hesitancy at this stage in AI's development.
*19:31.620- 19:37.460* :  The UK's National Reporting Center for fraud and cybercrime action fraud says sophisticated
*19:37.460- 19:43.960* :  voice cloning technology is increasingly prevalent, but victims might be unaware they're being targeted.
*19:44.540- 19:51.340* :  When we know that AI has very clear risks and harms and benefits to be fair right now,
*19:51.740- 19:57.180* :  to not regulate such transformative technology seems like a huge missed opportunity.
*19:57.180- 20:02.600* :  And I think that's why we see the EU and the US acting now to actually regulate it.
*20:03.060- 20:09.160* :  Look at the standards reporting and still to come. The Austrian Alpine Club, which has been
*20:09.160- 20:16.640* :  measuring glaciers for 133 years, said 2023 was exceptionally unfavorable for glaciers.
*20:17.020- 20:23.540* :  A mountaineering organisation warns that Austria risks becoming largely less free within 45 years.
*20:30.760- 20:35.160* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies
*20:35.160- 20:38.560* :  are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*20:38.980- 20:41.540* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*20:41.540- 20:46.960* :  owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t.
*20:47.180- 20:52.500* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*21:35.480- 21:39.900* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. President Biden has said he won't rest until
*21:39.900- 21:45.280* :  Baltimore's key bridge is rebuilt, as he visited the scene where a cargo ship crashed into it,
*21:45.620- 21:50.740* :  causing it to collapse into the harbor. His visit comes amid growing tensions in Congress over
*21:50.740- 21:55.960* :  using federal funds to rebuild the bridge, which regional authorities say is necessary for the
*21:55.960- 22:03.040* :  economy. So far, our team has been able to clear two small channels for essential ships helping
*22:03.040- 22:07.680* :  clear the wreckage. And by the end of May, we'll open the full channel.
*22:08.560- 22:12.060* :  I heard more from my correspondent, Will Verlin, who's in Baltimore in Maryland.
*22:12.780- 22:17.680* :  President Biden came here today to send a message of support, I think, and reassurance
*22:18.220- 22:24.040* :  to the local community 10 days after that catastrophic bridge collapse. The president
*22:24.040- 22:29.100* :  inspected the scene from the air. He met the families of those six construction workers
*22:29.100- 22:34.880* :  that were tragically killed in the disaster. And in his speech, Mr. Biden told Baltimore
*22:34.880- 22:41.760* :  that the nation has your back. He once again pledged to fully rebuild this bridge with federal
*22:41.760- 22:47.440* :  funds. And he promised more help for workers for local businesses here. Because, of course,
*22:47.440- 22:52.400* :  there is a big impact on the local economy. It's just not far from where I'm standing now,
*22:52.400- 22:58.240* :  Baltimore Port. One of America's busiest. It's still closed. There's no traffic going in or out
*22:58.240- 23:04.660* :  of that port. And that's because the river here is full of wreckage, concrete metal debris from
*23:04.660- 23:10.420* :  that collapse bridge. There's a lot of worry about the impact that this incident would have on one
*23:10.420- 23:15.700* :  of the busiest shipping lanes in the US. How is that playing out? Well, I mean, you're right. This
*23:15.700- 23:23.580* :  has a huge economic impact. The port directly generates over 15,000 jobs, say the authorities,
*23:23.580- 23:30.820* :  with an additional 140,000 jobs indirectly dependent on the port's activity. So everything
*23:30.820- 23:37.260* :  rests on when they can get that channel clear, get that port open. It's an incredibly complex
*23:37.260- 23:43.560* :  operation. There's a huge amount of debris in that water. The water is incredibly deep, fast moving.
*23:43.560- 23:48.360* :  I see water. The authorities were saying earlier that the visibility there is very low,
*23:48.360- 23:53.080* :  less than a meter. So it's incredibly difficult for the divers that are working there
*23:53.440- 23:58.500* :  underwater trying to cut up the metal to get the channel clear. And is there any controversy
*23:58.500- 24:04.220* :  about the rebuilding, the reconstruction and how that's done? There is. I mean, arguments are already
*24:04.220- 24:10.000* :  breaking out over who exactly will put the bill for this. As I said, President Biden has pledged
*24:10.000- 24:15.700* :  federal government funds to cover the cost. But that, of course, needs to be approved by Congress
*24:15.700- 24:21.700* :  and, and Mr. Biden again today called on Congress to approve that funding. Many Republicans are
*24:21.700- 24:27.180* :  skeptical about using federal dollars for such things. The House of Representatives here is very
*24:27.180- 24:31.920* :  divided at the moment on just about everything, actually. But specifically when it comes to this kind
*24:31.920- 24:37.220* :  of thing, hardliner Republicans, they're becoming increasingly dominant here. And they are
*24:37.220- 24:44.020* :  particularly not keyed on, on big spending bills like this. Well, Vernon with me from Baltimore.
*24:44.660- 24:49.940* :  Staying in the US, New York has experienced its biggest earthquake in 40 years. The magnitude
*24:49.940- 24:56.420* :  4.8 quake was felt across the state and beyond. But there are no reports of injury or damage to
*24:56.420- 25:02.620* :  buildings. Anorth America correspondent John Sudworth is in Manhattan. The epicenter was in a rural
*25:02.620- 25:08.000* :  area of the state of New Jersey. But the quake was big enough that some 50 miles to the east
*25:08.320- 25:13.180* :  within seconds. The residents of New York were lighting up social media with their accounts of
*25:13.180- 25:19.660* :  buildings swaying and household items rattling. At the United Nations in Midtown Manhattan, where
*25:19.660- 25:24.720* :  the Save the Children Organization was addressing the Security Council, the session was abruptly
*25:24.720- 25:30.140* :  halted. The moment caught on visibly wobbling video cameras. Education is
*25:35.860- 25:41.640* :  Education is education is education is in many ways.
*25:43.980- 25:47.740* :  Madam President, am I okay to continue? The flurry of media excitement, however,
*25:47.740- 25:52.300* :  has been prompted by the fact that earthquakes are relatively rare in this part of America,
*25:52.720- 25:58.280* :  not because there have been any reports of any damage or injuries. And while there are warnings
*25:58.280- 26:04.060* :  that aftershocks are possible, New York State Governor Kathy Hochel said there was no need for panic.
*26:04.380- 26:09.400* :  We are masters of disasters. We know how to handle this. We're always ready. We have
*26:09.400- 26:15.040* :  planning in place for all of our teams to activate instantaneously. While earthquakes are in frequent
*26:15.040- 26:20.900* :  in New York, they are sometimes felt the most recent one in January this year. Many others, though,
*26:20.900- 26:27.740* :  are so tiny that they almost always go unnoticed. Now Spain has a reputation for its night life.
*26:27.740- 26:33.200* :  People work late and eat late with bars and restaurants open well after midnight. Could all
*26:33.200- 26:38.080* :  that be about to change, though? The country's deputy prime minister, Yolanda Diaz, who runs the
*26:38.080- 26:43.020* :  left wing platform Sumar, a partner of the coalition government, wants to bring Spain in line with
*26:43.020- 26:48.700* :  the rest of Europe. She says working late hours is detrimental to the long term health of staff.
*26:49.400- 26:54.940* :  How realistic could that change be as she Sharma took to the bars and restaurants of Madrid to find out?
*26:55.780- 27:01.040* :  Now, if I was to say to you that I work in a sector that contributes over $20 billion per year
*27:01.600- 27:07.460* :  towards my country's GDP, you may well reply great, leave it alone then. Don't change anything.
*27:13.520- 27:18.440* :  Well, that's Yolanda Diaz, the Labour Minister and the deputy prime minister. And she's talking
*27:18.440- 27:24.160* :  about the food and drinks industry. Diaz wants bars and restaurants, which can stay open as
*27:24.160- 27:29.540* :  late as 3 a.m. to close much earlier. But what do Spanish people who live this lifestyle,
*27:29.540- 27:35.900* :  but also tourists whose income represents about 12% of Spanish economy think about the idea?
*27:38.580- 27:46.060* :  I think it's a really good idea. I agree, of course. I think she means that if you work until
*27:47.020- 27:53.260* :  one o'clock to a clock, you have to be well paid. It's not that now that we work until
*27:53.760- 27:58.140* :  one o'clock, but the salary is not really proper for that schedule.
*27:59.780- 28:06.900* :  I don't want to change anything. I like Spain, I love Spain, and I would like things like that.
*28:07.720- 28:12.100* :  When we're on the road, we like to get our days started early. And it's a difficulty to get
*28:12.100- 28:17.060* :  things started early because things close so late, they tend to open late, which means that you don't
*28:17.060- 28:23.760* :  have the opportunity to go tour and do things early in the morning when it's less crowded and
*28:24.140- 28:27.180* :  more advantageous to old people like myself.
*28:32.120- 28:37.980* :  I just wanted into the Mercado San Fernando, which is a really popular place, and I'm joined by
*28:37.980- 28:45.040* :  the owner of one small bar called El Perencena. I hope I've said it right, Borca. Borca, what do you
*28:45.040- 28:50.960* :  think about the idea of bars and restaurants and cafes and clubs closing early? That's
*28:50.960- 28:58.560* :  information. It's not good for us because we need to win money. If they close at 12 o'clock,
*28:59.340- 29:06.360* :  maybe many locals will be closer. It's not possible to ask the workers. It's not a good decision
*29:06.360- 29:14.420* :  for them too. It's not only for the enterprise. It's for the worker too. What would be your message
*29:14.860- 29:25.560* :  to your land? I don't want to close at 11 or 12. I need to open to 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock. The night
*29:25.560- 29:30.960* :  is so important in Madrid. Many people go out at the night. It's not possible.
*29:31.120- 29:37.600* :  Sofiela des desarrolladas están funcionando 24 horas. Vicente Pizqueta is from the organization called
*29:37.600- 29:44.420* :  Spain by night, which represents bars, clubs, restaurants and discos. All the world's major cities
*29:44.420- 29:50.880* :  are active 24 hours a day. It goes without saying such as the police, emergency services and so
*29:50.880- 29:56.960* :  two workers in clubs. But there are also many other sectors such as cleaning and maintenance services.
*29:57.660- 30:01.580* :  These can only function at night because their work can only start once the commercial
*30:01.580- 30:07.760* :  activities of the day have finished. That's when they take over. It's coming up to lunchtime
*30:07.760- 30:13.500* :  and the bars and restaurants here in Madrid are beginning to fill up. Ylena Diaz wants
*30:13.500- 30:19.420* :  her country's working patents to be more in line with the rest of Europe. That's to say, a 35
*30:19.420- 30:25.660* :  hour working week. But by starting with the country's night life in social habits, she may well
*30:25.660- 30:31.480* :  have jumped off in the deep end. Ashishama in Madrid. Next to Austria, a mountaineering
*30:31.480- 30:37.100* :  organization is walling that the country risks becoming largely ice-free within 45 years,
*30:37.540- 30:42.740* :  with almost all of its glaciers disappearing. In its annual report, the Austrian Alpine
*30:42.740- 30:49.060* :  Club said 92 out of 93 glaciers it measured over the past year had shrunk due to climate change.
*30:49.060- 30:53.580* :  Here's our correspondent Bethany Bell. The Austrian Alpine Club, which has been
*30:53.580- 31:01.080* :  measuring glaciers for 133 years, said 2023 was exceptionally unfavorable for glaciers.
*31:01.840- 31:08.240* :  On average, they shrank by 23 meters. The report says heat waves and dry conditions over the
*31:08.240- 31:14.560* :  past couple of years mean glaciers have been unable to regenerate. Gerhard Lieb from the Alpine
*31:14.560- 31:19.680* :  Club called on Austria's leaders to take action to protect the glaciers and their surroundings
*31:19.740- 31:28.060* :  as a matter of urgency. The disappearance of the glaciers is a sign of how climate change
*31:28.060- 31:33.900* :  is increasingly a problem for society, and now is the time for politicians to respond more
*31:33.900- 31:40.980* :  decisively. The most badly affected glacier was the pastelpsa in the southern province of
*31:40.980- 31:48.140* :  Corinthia, which shrank by more than 203 meters, a new record. The Redenbach-Fernig glacier in
*31:48.140- 31:55.720* :  Tyrol shrank by 127 meters. The Alpine Club warned against expanding ski resorts into glacier
*31:55.720- 32:01.480* :  regions. It said Austria's winter tourism industry needed to adopt policies which were more
*32:01.480- 32:07.660* :  environmentally friendly and sustainable. A family from California have been reunited with their
*32:07.660- 32:13.600* :  missing dog. After she was found in a different U.S. state, more than 3,000 kilometers away from
*32:13.600- 32:20.160* :  home. Almost nine months after her disappearance, Mishka reappeared safe and well-fed, roaming around
*32:20.160- 32:24.660* :  a suburb of Detroit. A New York correspondent Netta Torfick takes up the tale.
*32:25.400- 32:31.320* :  Mishka's family has nicknamed her the Miracle Dog. Their heartwarming reunion was the happy ending
*32:31.320- 32:37.000* :  to a cross-country tale that began when their golden-haired terrier mix disappeared last July,
*32:37.000- 32:43.520* :  from San Diego, California, only to be discovered more than 2,000 miles away in Michigan.
*32:44.400- 32:48.440* :  How she ended up there is a mystery. After her disappearance, her owners,
*32:48.440- 32:54.260* :  Miraden Lizhuman and their young daughter posted flyers around town and please on social media
*32:54.260- 32:59.560* :  and had gone months without any encouraging news. Then, just as they were planning to visit
*32:59.560- 33:04.760* :  relatives in Minneapolis for Easter weekend, they got a call from an animal shelter across the
*33:04.760- 33:15.980* :  country that Mishka had been found. Once the family landed in Minnesota,
*33:15.980- 33:22.260* :  Mirad drove 10 hours overnight to Michigan to get her. Liz says it felt like she never left.
*33:22.260- 33:28.100* :  She jumped out of the car seat into the window and just basically in their arms and she knew
*33:28.100- 33:33.840* :  exactly who we were and it was wonderful. It's all thanks to a good Samaritan who reported a stray
*33:33.840- 33:38.780* :  dog in their suburban Detroit neighborhood because Mishka had been chipped executive director
*33:38.780- 33:44.340* :  Karine Hartman says the gross point animal adoption society was able to match her with her owners.
*33:44.660- 33:49.360* :  It's what everyone in an animal shelter hopes for. I mean, that's her job. The hope and the dream
*33:49.360- 33:54.020* :  is always that you'll reunite them with their owner and would love to know the story but only
*33:54.020- 33:59.780* :  Mishka can tell us and she's not talking. Mishka's healthy and doing great and the humans even
*33:59.780- 34:04.880* :  discovered that she's learned a few new tricks like how to sit in her time away from them.
*34:08.600- 34:12.100* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
