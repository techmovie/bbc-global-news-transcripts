*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:12.560* :  from across the world, the latest news 7 days a week. BBC World Service Podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:16.200- 00:21.820* :  The Global Jigsaw is the podcast zooming in on the world's political, security and social shifts
*00:21.820- 00:25.800* :  through the lens of its media. A completely lack of control of the state and the government,
*00:25.800- 00:28.620* :  conflicting narratives. They're feeling the impact of this war.
*00:28.940- 00:31.360* :  The Global Jigsaw from the BBC World Service.
*00:37.500- 00:41.020* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:42.000- 00:48.640* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Monday, April 1st, these are our main stories.
*00:48.640- 00:54.660* :  Gaza's Shifa Hospital is left in ruins as Israel pulls back from a two-week military operation.
*00:54.880- 01:00.380* :  Turkey's opposition wins big in local elections on a night of heavy defeats for the party
*01:00.380- 01:06.820* :  of President Erdogan and 12 people are arrested in Pakistan over a car bombing of Chinese workers
*01:07.300- 01:09.340* :  involved in a hydroelectric dam project.
*01:11.800- 01:17.960* :  Also in this podcast, the first green shoots of growth appear in the world's second biggest
*01:17.960- 01:23.680* :  economy, the fight to save Africa's marine wildlife from a tsunami of plastic waste and
*01:23.680- 01:30.380* :  lead is the spirit. And that spirit is unvanquished. It does not disappear, it does not
*01:30.700- 01:35.620* :  become depressed because of all this. Look at how cheerful people are.
*01:36.080- 01:40.820* :  Hundreds of people turn out to mark the closure of an independent bookstore in Hong Kong
*01:40.820- 01:43.660* :  after constant complaints from the authorities.
*01:47.800- 01:53.220* :  Gaza's largest hospital, Al Shifa, has taken in some of the many thousands of Palestinians who
*01:53.220- 01:57.960* :  suffered from Israel's military operation in the territory. But the medical facility has
*01:57.960- 02:02.480* :  itself borne the brunt of some of the most recent intense military bombardment.
*02:02.480- 02:07.760* :  Now, Israel says it has completed its operation there and all its troops have left the area.
*02:08.160- 02:13.840* :  The UN's Georgios Petro Poulos, who's in Gaza, told the BBC that all sides should respect the
*02:13.840- 02:16.340* :  status of our Shifa and other hospitals.
*02:16.600- 02:22.480* :  The international humanitarian law tells us that if a hospital is functioning as a hospital,
*02:22.480- 02:27.340* :  it's at a protected place. We continue to call on all parties. You have to let these hospitals
*02:27.340- 02:34.380* :  be hospitals. If any side is using it as anything other than that, it stands to lose its legitimate
*02:34.380- 02:39.000* :  status as a protected site. We don't have enough of these things left here in the Gaza Strip
*02:39.360- 02:40.540* :  to be playing games like this.
*02:40.900- 02:45.460* :  I asked our correspondent in Jerusalem, Yoland, Nell, why the Israelis had pulled out.
*02:45.800- 02:51.420* :  They say that their operation there has been completed and you can now see video on social media
*02:51.420- 02:55.900* :  that shows this Shifa site basically burnt out with parts of it in total ruins.
*02:55.900- 03:02.240* :  A lot of destruction in the area around the residential area and the Hamas-eraan Health Ministry says
*03:02.240- 03:08.520* :  dozens of bodies have been found at that site. Now witnesses said that there had been Israeli
*03:08.520- 03:13.160* :  air strikes that they were shelling in that area this morning at the time when tanks and armoured
*03:13.160- 03:18.120* :  vehicles withdrew, apparently giving them cover. We can see now that crowds of Palestinians have
*03:18.120- 03:24.540* :  returned to the site are looking around sort of bewildered. The Israeli Prime Minister had said
*03:24.540- 03:30.180* :  when he spoke just last night that this had become a Shifa a terrorist layer in his words,
*03:30.180- 03:35.580* :  although Hamas has consistently denied using hospitals in Gaza as a base. The Israeli military
*03:35.580- 03:42.020* :  said that there were some 200 terrorists in its words killed in and around the Shifa site
*03:42.020- 03:46.960* :  in the last two weeks, calling this previously one of the most successful operations of the war
*03:46.960- 03:52.260* :  so far. Palestinians who live in that area told us that there were many innocent people who had
*03:52.260- 03:58.380* :  been killed, they had been left starving, they'd been left without water. Hamas said that there were
*03:58.380- 04:03.480* :  doctors and there were patients that were killed during this operation. As you say, the places in
*04:03.480- 04:08.140* :  ruins can it ever really function as a hospital again? I mean, I think it will have to be
*04:08.140- 04:14.400* :  totally rebuilt. Interestingly, the hospital had started to go back into service not long after
*04:14.400- 04:20.620* :  the previous raid back in November by the Israeli military, but now we can see that there was so much
*04:20.620- 04:25.240* :  close quarters fighting that took place. There were airstrikes in and around this hospital
*04:25.760- 04:30.580* :  that it has left it with extremely sort of serious damage. I think parts will just have to be
*04:30.580- 04:35.600* :  raised in order for it to function as a hospital again. We've also been getting these reports that
*04:35.600- 04:42.740* :  Israel has arrested the sister of the leader of Hamas, Ismail Haneia, and she was living in Israel.
*04:43.220- 04:47.800* :  That's correct. I mean, this is something that we were just hearing about, that she was a resident
*04:47.800- 04:52.720* :  of a town in the south of Israel called Telecheva, and that she's been arrested on suspicion of
*04:52.720- 04:59.400* :  contact with operatives from Hamas, and on suspicion of supporting acts of terror. She's said to
*04:59.400- 05:04.300* :  be a 57-year-old woman, arrested in a joint operation with the Israeli Domestic Intelligence
*05:04.300- 05:09.880* :  Services. Her name hasn't been given out, but we understand that she's supposed to appear at the
*05:09.880- 05:15.640* :  Beersheva magistrate's court later for a hearing on her detention. We have heard previously about
*05:15.640- 05:20.140* :  Ismail Haneia's relatives during the course of the war. It was said that one of his granddaughters
*05:20.140- 05:26.720* :  still in Gaza, where he's from, was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Of course, Ismail Haneia has lived
*05:27.080- 05:31.420* :  for some years now out of Gaza. He's usually based in Qatar.
*05:32.380- 05:38.620* :  You learned now. Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in excellent health
*05:38.620- 05:43.180* :  following surgery to treat a hernia, according to the hospital that's been treating him.
*05:43.600- 05:48.920* :  Mr Netanyahu's medical condition hasn't stifled criticism of his handling of the war with Hamas,
*05:49.380- 05:54.040* :  and his failure thus far to achieve the release of those Israelis still held in Gaza.
*05:54.500- 05:58.220* :  Tens of thousands of protesters have filled the streets of big cities across Israel,
*05:58.220- 06:02.900* :  calling for Mr Netanyahu's resignation, and urging him to call fresh elections,
*06:02.900- 06:07.720* :  and strike an immediate deal to free the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza.
*06:08.220- 06:13.300* :  They gathered outside the Israeli Parliament from where our international editor Jeremy Bowen reports.
*06:17.100- 06:25.300* :  We are just outside the Knessets. Israelis have already deployed hundreds of police officers
*06:25.780- 06:30.520* :  and Katya, demonstrator, opponent of the government, is here with a light hailer.
*06:30.520- 06:38.540* :  Since eight this morning, I'm here, and now I'm telling Bibi Netanyahu that I'll be glad to pay
*06:38.540- 06:45.440* :  one way ticket first class for him to go out and not come back. Will they listen to you?
*06:45.560- 06:50.080* :  No, no, they don't listen to us. We are not important for them.
*06:52.480- 06:57.360* :  Inside the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, the Netanyahu coalition depends on the support
*06:57.360- 07:06.220* :  of ultra-nationalist Jewish MPs. Like the Prime Minister, Ohat Tal, one of his backers from
*07:06.220- 07:12.720* :  the religious Zionism party, believes only military force in Gaza will free the hostages,
*07:13.340- 07:16.260* :  not trusting Hamas to respect a deal.
*07:16.780- 07:22.840* :  It's a very naive thing to say, because you don't think Hamas will bring back so easily the
*07:22.840- 07:30.320* :  hostages in a deal, release everybody, and then will allow us to kill all the terrorists that
*07:30.320- 07:35.420* :  we will release in such a deal in the day after. It's not as simple.
*07:39.940- 07:45.420* :  What's mid-evening now, and I'm back near the Knesset, and there are thousands of demonstrators,
*07:45.420- 07:50.840* :  probably tens of thousands, in the broad avenue outside it, where the government ministries are
*07:50.840- 07:57.820* :  including the Prime Minister's office. Now, I've been talking to a very senior former general,
*07:57.820- 08:03.640* :  prominent politician, didn't want to be interviewed. He wants elections here, and all these people
*08:04.140- 08:08.540* :  want elections as well, and the general just said to me, he said, look, this is going to make
*08:08.540- 08:13.860* :  a difference. I'm not so sure about that. Mr Netanyahu has been on TV. He says they're not having
*08:13.860- 08:21.860* :  elections. Calls for elections will paralyze Israel. They will paralyze negotiations for the release
*08:21.940- 08:26.740* :  of our hostages, and will lead to ending the war before achieving its goals.
*08:28.180- 08:31.740* :  I've come behind the main platform now of the place where they're making speeches to the
*08:31.740- 08:38.440* :  area where the leaders of this protest are. Benjamin Netanyahu, when he first became Prime Minister
*08:38.440- 08:45.820* :  in 1996, his office was run by David Agmon, a Brigadier general, and he's here tonight,
*08:45.820- 08:51.800* :  one of the protest leaders. How serious is this crisis? I'll tell you. It's the biggest crisis
*08:51.800- 09:00.680* :  that ever. I was the first chief of staff of Netanyahu in 1996, and after three months,
*09:01.600- 09:12.140* :  I decided to leave, because I found that he's a danger to Israel. Why? Because he doesn't know
*09:12.920- 09:19.700* :  how to take decisions, and I saw his lies. And after three months, I told him, baby,
*09:20.240- 09:23.200* :  you don't need the aid, you need the replacement.
*09:30.400- 09:36.580* :  After the 7th of October attacks, Israelis were so shocked and traumatized by what happened.
*09:36.580- 09:44.480* :  They put aside their divisions for a while, but they are wide open. Once again, six months in,
*09:44.480- 09:51.600* :  and there are two big points. One is getting the hostages back, because that hasn't happened,
*09:52.660- 09:58.040* :  and the other one is the future of the Prime Minister, and certainly, on this street today,
*09:58.040- 10:08.900* :  this very big demonstration, they want him out. Jeremy Bowen in Jerusalem. For months, years
*10:08.900- 10:14.200* :  even, the news out of the Chinese economy has not been good. Low growth, rising unemployment,
*10:14.200- 10:19.860* :  and a crisis in the property sector. But now, official figures suggest that the world's second
*10:19.860- 10:25.160* :  largest economy is showing tentative signs of recovery. The National Statistics Bureau says
*10:25.160- 10:30.400* :  factory output is slightly up for the first time in six months. With the details, here's our
*10:30.400- 10:34.880* :  Asia Business Reporter, Nick Marsh. Factory output is used in China as a measure of its
*10:34.880- 10:40.160* :  economic health, because it's such a big manufacturing powerhouse. If you've been following what's
*10:40.160- 10:45.780* :  been going on in China the last year or two, they're going through quite a bad economic slowdown.
*10:45.780- 10:50.140* :  Maybe the worst economic slowdown it's had in modern times, actually. We're used to hearing
*10:50.140- 10:56.460* :  all this stuff about China being this behemoth, really, this world's second largest economy,
*10:56.460- 11:01.640* :  an engine for global growth. Recently, you've had this awful crisis in the property sector,
*11:02.160- 11:07.140* :  youth unemployment, high growth has been really low by its own very high standards. This news
*11:07.140- 11:13.500* :  from its manufacturing output, its factory activity, is actually indicating that it's up,
*11:13.500- 11:20.160* :  which shows that there could be some kind of green shoots of recovery situation after all this
*11:20.160- 11:25.660* :  bad news, it's rare positive news. The government will be happy about that, but there is still a
*11:25.660- 11:30.220* :  long way to go, because the problems they run deep, it's an economy built on making things,
*11:30.220- 11:34.180* :  building things, if you run out of things to build or if you build too much, like they have with
*11:34.180- 11:39.420* :  houses, the big property crisis, you get these bubbles, so it's about transitioning out of it,
*11:39.420- 11:44.980* :  but a small short-term piece of good news for people in China right now, Nick Marsh.
*11:45.900- 11:52.440* :  Discarded plastic in the world's oceans kills countless sea mammals every year, trapping and
*11:52.440- 11:57.360* :  entangling them. On Africa's southwest coast, the Environmental Group Ocean Conservation
*11:57.360- 12:04.820* :  Namibia says it is rescued around 3,000 seals since 2020. The team uses large nets to close in and
*12:04.820- 12:10.940* :  capture seals entangled in discarded fishing gear and other maritime rubbish. Catcher Dreyer
*12:10.940- 12:17.100* :  is the co-founder of Ocean Conservation Namibia. She's been telling Joe Inward about their work
*12:17.100- 12:22.280* :  and the scale of the problem. Most of us here rescues are fairly easy, we just catch the animal,
*12:22.280- 12:28.220* :  cut through the entanglement and release the animal and it often just takes a couple of seconds.
*12:28.940- 12:34.280* :  Other rescues take very long because entanglement is deeply embedded in the wound, in the flesh,
*12:34.740- 12:39.140* :  and then we always need to find a balance between working as quick as possible to get the entanglement
*12:39.140- 12:44.580* :  off and also try to avoid more damage and pain to the animal. We celebrate every single
*12:44.580- 12:50.060* :  and rescued animal as a huge accomplishment for our team and it's always really joys moment,
*12:50.100- 12:55.800* :  but also at the same time just considering the amount of entanglement we've done over the past
*12:55.800- 13:01.360* :  years. We always painfully aware that we're only treating a symptom to the problem and not the
*13:01.360- 13:06.360* :  actual root cause. Yeah, because tell people who don't understand this, how big a problem,
*13:06.880- 13:10.520* :  rubbish and especially plastic discarded fishing, it's how big a problem is this?
*13:10.740- 13:15.480* :  It's a massive problem. I mean, one of the biggest issues is probably that we don't get to see it.
*13:15.480- 13:19.480* :  Once the plastic is in the ocean, it's below the surface and nobody cares about it anymore.
*13:20.060- 13:26.220* :  But for our marine animals, they've got nowhere else to go. They live in the ocean and we have
*13:26.220- 13:31.160* :  turned the ocean into a complete rubbish dumpster. We find most of our animals actually entangled in
*13:31.160- 13:35.940* :  very small pieces of rubbish and there's really no limit to the imagination what we find.
*13:35.940- 13:41.700* :  They're plastic bags, ziploc bags, closing heads, gaskets, anything you can possibly think of.
*13:42.380- 13:47.120* :  And the animals swim around in the ocean, some of them play with it, others don't get to see it.
*13:47.480- 13:51.280* :  They simply get caught in the debris and for most of them it's a death trap.
*13:51.740- 13:57.640* :  Now, I remember a few years ago, I was doing some filming in Kenya, so on the other side of Africa
*13:58.140- 14:04.240* :  and I was astonished to see the places that the rubbish came from. We were filming down the coast
*14:04.240- 14:09.080* :  and we would see water bottles that had washed in from India, from all the way up in the Middle East,
*14:09.080- 14:13.920* :  from stuff that had come in from the UK. Are you seeing that? Where are you seeing this rubbish come
*14:13.920- 14:18.540* :  from? How far afield is it? Here in Namibia we are actually quite lucky because we are on the
*14:18.540- 14:24.100* :  west coast of Africa. If you look at the east coast, Kenya, Mozambique, everywhere there,
*14:24.540- 14:28.420* :  you get all the rubbish that's coming from South East Asia and that is absolutely horrifying.
*14:28.420- 14:33.160* :  You can spend hours doing a beach clean up there and you come back a few hours later and it's all
*14:33.160- 14:39.520* :  back. So that's absolutely terrifying. In our case, our currents are actually keeping our part of
*14:39.520- 14:45.240* :  the ocean relatively clean. We've got the Benguela current here and also here in Namibia,
*14:45.340- 14:50.160* :  but that's very specific to Namibia. We are desert country. We've got only two rivers that flow
*14:50.160- 14:55.240* :  throughout the year so we don't get much rubbish from inlands because in a lot of other countries
*14:55.660- 15:00.400* :  that is a major issue that a lot of plastic comes in from rivers. So it's pollution that's created
*15:00.400- 15:05.740* :  inlands and then it gets washed into the ocean. Katja Dreyer talking to Joe Inwood.
*15:06.620- 15:12.920* :  Two Sierra Leone now where one man has made history by becoming the country's first ever blind
*15:12.920- 15:19.280* :  law graduate. It's a landmark achievement for Amidu Abubaka. He's still got another year to go
*15:19.280- 15:25.140* :  before he can officially practice, but he's taken time out to tell Umaru Fufana a bit about his
*15:25.140- 15:30.700* :  journey towards the legal profession. I very beginning of it, I was not having even a phone and I
*15:30.700- 15:36.540* :  was not even having a computer. So what I did I was like coming to colleagues so I met with them,
*15:36.880- 15:41.180* :  I made sure I have a talk with them. I asked them also how the cause look like and what can
*15:41.180- 15:45.800* :  they help me if they have any notes so I actually implore them to assist them with the guidance.
*15:45.800- 15:50.580* :  So why is it beginning? I put on my local recorder, I call all the information, all the audio. So when
*15:50.580- 15:56.160* :  I go home I listen. So he couldn't access textbooks in Braille? Not at all, even after this point
*15:56.160- 16:01.340* :  I'm still battling with actually having Britex book on law. So yeah, it's still a very big
*16:01.340- 16:06.540* :  challenge. If you have the means, supports, you have the money, you have the money power, I'm sure
*16:06.860- 16:11.880* :  perhaps even to access a computer internet was very difficult. But now, let me have a fact,
*16:11.880- 16:15.580* :  you have very supports. When you're supposed to do it, you can have a laptop, you can have an
*16:15.580- 16:23.660* :  iPhone, you can go to an internet and do a browsing. And that's how I got my laptop. So it was
*16:23.660- 16:28.700* :  like an easy guide. When the head of department called at your name during the
*16:28.700- 16:33.540* :  conference of your degree, could you talk me through what went through your mind? How you felt
*16:33.540- 16:41.620* :  emotionally? I was like, I was about to cry really. I was like, I saw the journey so far off,
*16:41.620- 16:46.980* :  like I couldn't really be able to finish, I couldn't achieve that. So like, not very day when
*16:46.980- 16:52.580* :  you call my name, I was like, oh God, you're only very good. I was like, I'm going to
*16:53.120- 16:58.360* :  I'm a do ever back her. And to hear a longer version of that conversation, just search for our
*16:58.360- 17:07.080* :  sister, BBC podcast, Africa Daily, wherever you get your podcasts. Still to come. Some German
*17:07.080- 17:12.520* :  people doing their beer, after work and we just want to smoke or meet after work. Germany
*17:13.160- 17:14.380* :  relaxes its cannabis laws.
*17:22.000- 17:26.580* :  A week after the killing of five Chinese engineers and their Pakistani driver,
*17:26.580- 17:31.720* :  the authorities in Pakistan have made a dozen arrests. Officials said among those detained
*17:31.720- 17:36.940* :  was the man suspected of facilitating the attack, which took place in the northern Kaiba
*17:37.340- 17:42.980* :  province. I heard more about the arrests and the original attack from our South Asia,
*17:42.980- 17:48.840* :  original editor and barassan at a Russian. A group of Chinese engineers, they were returning from
*17:48.840- 17:54.700* :  the capital Islamabad to Dow Dam project site, where more than a thousand Chinese workers
*17:55.300- 18:02.740* :  are staying. And in Kaiba, Patun Kua province, when this man was crossing, a vehicle was coming in
*18:02.740- 18:07.080* :  the opposite direction. And then suddenly there was an explosion. There were videos circulating
*18:07.080- 18:13.940* :  on social media showing this particular incident. And following this, this vehicle fell into a
*18:13.940- 18:19.140* :  deep ravine, five Chinese engineers and that Pakistani driver, they were killed. And China
*18:19.140- 18:24.820* :  expressed a strong concern over the security of its citizens based in Pakistan. As you know,
*18:25.140- 18:29.500* :  China has invested billions of dollars and they are carrying out various infrastructure projects
*18:29.500- 18:35.660* :  inside Pakistan. So there are Chinese nationals. And now the police say that they have arrested
*18:35.660- 18:39.880* :  at least 12 people in connection with this incident, especially one of those
*18:40.980- 18:47.700* :  one person's who they say facilitated the movement of this explosive slated vehicle into Pakistan.
*18:47.820- 18:53.400* :  Why were the Chinese engineers being targeted? Attacks on Chinese nationals are not uncommon.
*18:53.400- 18:59.240* :  Usually these things happen in the Balochistan province for southwestern Pakistan, where China is
*18:59.240- 19:05.540* :  also building a deep port and economic complex in Gwadar area. And there, they have been attacks
*19:05.540- 19:11.000* :  because the Baloch separatist rebels, they accuse the Chinese of exploiting their natural
*19:11.620- 19:15.820* :  resources and also putting pressure on Pakistan. But what is happening in Northwest is a different
*19:15.820- 19:20.980* :  because the police suspect Pakistan and Taliban could be responsible for this particular attack.
*19:21.360- 19:27.680* :  And Barasan Etirajan. President Erdogan's AK Party has suffered its biggest ever to
*19:27.680- 19:33.060* :  defeat in local elections in Turkey, causing a political setback just a year after Mr. Erdogan
*19:33.060- 19:38.840* :  secured a fifth term in office. The vote was also the largest victory in 45 years for the main
*19:38.840- 19:45.860* :  opposition CHP party, which won in the five largest urban centres, including Turkey's biggest city
*19:46.120- 19:50.240* :  Istanbul. Supporters of the opposition celebrated late into the night.
*19:52.920- 19:59.700* :  We feel incredible. We are living a day that we have been waiting for for years. We are so happy.
*19:59.700- 20:09.200* :  We cannot believe it. Democracy won. The Republic won. I'm so happy. I'm going to lose my mind.
*20:12.220- 20:15.440* :  We are in our early 20s. We really see this as a salvation.
*20:19.740- 20:25.100* :  We want to see a more free country where the economy is better. Turkey is way below its potential
*20:25.100- 20:33.280* :  and we believe that it can show larger development. Turkey's opposition leader,
*20:33.280- 20:39.180* :  Uzghur Ozal, said the results, said that voters had decided to establish a new politics in Turkey.
*20:39.600- 20:43.500* :  That was a theme picked up by the Secretary-General of his party,
*20:43.500- 20:50.120* :  Selin Syak-Bouka, when she gave us her reaction to the results. We're very excited. We're excited
*20:50.120- 20:55.880* :  because we're at the start of a new era of politics and we're excited because the good service
*20:55.880- 21:00.860* :  that has been provided in our local governments in the past five years has actually now been extended
*21:00.860- 21:05.960* :  to a much larger geography in Turkey. So we look forward to serving to a larger population
*21:06.580- 21:11.900* :  and to ensuring that democracy rule of law and a strong welfare state is actually established
*21:11.900- 21:16.660* :  through our local governments, which should open up a new era of politics in that way as well.
*21:16.960- 21:21.940* :  It was just last year that President Erdogan won the presidential election and then this year
*21:21.940- 21:27.180* :  he's obviously suffered this major reverse. What do you think has led to the change in his
*21:27.180- 21:32.980* :  electoral fortunes over this last year? I think two dynamics have played out. One has been people
*21:32.980- 21:38.640* :  are really fed up of the polarization so we have a very strong coming together under the umbrella
*21:38.640- 21:45.400* :  of CHP this time and the second is the economy has been doing so poorly that people are seeking out
*21:45.400- 21:52.980* :  now ways where reaching out government resources giving them to those who are in need and solidarity
*21:52.980- 21:58.840* :  and infrastructure investments instead of the Rontier system that Erdogan has built has actually
*21:58.840- 22:05.400* :  been approved through the very strong coming back of those cities that we were governing and indeed
*22:05.400- 22:11.900* :  now into new cities who are saying we want the same service, we want the same understanding of politics.
*22:12.300- 22:17.060* :  One of the things that's been quite notable over the years of President Erdogan's time in power
*22:17.060- 22:21.920* :  is the increasing role of Islam in politics and there's something which obviously is the
*22:22.220- 22:27.180* :  Turkish state always tried to avoid. Is that something that your party would try to reverse as
*22:27.180- 22:33.300* :  you gain more power to return Turkey to its secular roots? What we seek to do is indeed end the
*22:33.300- 22:39.920* :  polarization in Turkey and end the abuse of all values that make Turkey Turkey and all values
*22:39.920- 22:45.640* :  people feel as their own values. These should not be abused by politicians instead it should be
*22:45.640- 22:52.940* :  allowed in a very free way to be lived by every individual in their own sense of being. So what
*22:52.980- 23:00.020* :  we would want to end is the polarization and the abuse of ethnic identities, the abuse of religion
*23:00.020- 23:06.560* :  as a political instrument but rather make sure that the rule of law and our constitution
*23:06.560- 23:12.200* :  which protects the freedom of every individual to live their religion in the way they wish to
*23:12.580- 23:17.600* :  to make sure that they can live their ethnic identity the way they wish to will be ensured
*23:17.600- 23:24.000* :  through a very democratic and a new era of politics. So we seek to end the polarization and the
*23:24.000- 23:28.740* :  abuse of all these values that make Turkey Turkey at the end of the day.
*23:29.000- 23:37.040* :  Saleen Sayak Bukhah she was speaking to Joe Inwood. From today people in Germany will no longer be
*23:37.040- 23:42.340* :  prosecuted for possessing small amounts of cannabis. The government says the part legalization
*23:42.680- 23:47.220* :  is an attempt to tackle the black market. The new rules are a watered down version of what was
*23:47.220- 23:53.100* :  originally planned under the government's coalition agreement. The rules for medical marijuana are
*23:53.100- 23:57.740* :  also being relaxed. Our correspondent Jessica Parker reports from Dresden.
*24:04.140- 24:11.100* :  A group of young men smoke cannabis in a park. Over 18s can now possess up to 25 grams of the drug
*24:11.100- 24:17.040* :  in public enough for dozens of joints and grow up to three plants at home.
*24:19.920- 24:25.340* :  This is noise stat the heart of Dresden's alternative scene where we meet Marcel Richel.
*24:25.520- 24:30.880* :  Some German people doing their beer after work and we just want to smoke or we'd have to work.
*24:30.940- 24:35.600* :  He wants to set up a newly allowed not-for-profit cannabis social club.
*24:35.700- 24:40.880* :  Like a gardening club but for him. To grow and distribute the drug to members.
*24:41.300- 24:47.080* :  Avigram from cannabis which goes from the cannabis social club is one that's not on the
*24:47.240- 24:53.380* :  black market. What do you say to people who say look cannabis is addictive and it is harmful
*24:53.380- 24:59.700* :  especially to young people? Everything have dark sides and you have to know about the dark sides
*24:59.700- 25:05.040* :  and only when it's not illegal you can free talk about these dark sides.
*25:05.080- 25:08.780* :  Legalization of other drugs that are consumed by children and youths.
*25:08.960- 25:12.880* :  This is the biggest place in which I have heard every word of this colleague and colleague.
*25:13.980- 25:19.620* :  There was a stormy debate in parliament over these changes which are controversial and complex.
*25:19.620- 25:25.260* :  The social clubs will be fought German residents only to guard against cannabis tourism.
*25:25.260- 25:31.080* :  But they can't open until July. Alexander Poitz from the German police union believes
*25:31.080- 25:33.980* :  demand will outstrip legal supply.
*25:33.980- 25:42.320* :  We assume that the black market will be strengthened, particularly at the beginning in the chaos phase
*25:42.960- 25:45.860* :  when demand will be great because of the signal this law sends.
*25:46.380- 25:52.680* :  The black market and criminal networks will adapt and they will also infiltrate the social clubs.
*25:56.680- 26:00.020* :  Just outside Dresden I wash my hands and put on an overall.
*26:00.880- 26:03.580* :  The building I'm in used to be a slaughterhouse.
*26:03.940- 26:06.780* :  It's now being used to grow medical cannabis.
*26:09.680- 26:13.920* :  I'm wearing rubber crocs because you have to to come in here for hygiene purposes
*26:13.920- 26:16.760* :  and just to describe the room I'm in it's full of weed.
*26:17.420- 26:23.700* :  There are heat lamps above me on the ceiling about 650 cannabis plants in the room.
*26:24.680- 26:28.860* :  They'll produce, we're told, between 80 to 100 kilograms of dried cannabis
*26:29.320- 26:32.520* :  and they're nearly ready to be harvested that's probably going to happen in the next couple of weeks.
*26:33.440- 26:37.560* :  The new rules mean facilities like this will be able to grow and sell more.
*26:37.560- 26:41.000* :  Philip Goebel is a managing director of Demacan.
*26:41.280- 26:44.000* :  Cannabis will not be in the cottage anymore in Germany.
*26:44.000- 26:49.920* :  It will be just as any other pharmaceutical product which makes it's much more easier for patients
*26:49.920- 26:52.920* :  to get it from a doctor and to get it from the pharmacy.
*26:52.920- 26:57.740* :  So we think that the volume will double by end of the year starting from the last year.
*26:57.860- 27:02.820* :  We think it will take time for doctors and for patients to get used to it to bite in the pharmacy in the end.
*27:06.140- 27:09.160* :  An intricate water system feeds these plants.
*27:09.160- 27:15.000* :  The benefits of medical cannabis are debated while arguments around the relaxation of
*27:15.720- 27:19.280* :  recreational use have dripped through German society for years.
*27:19.960- 27:24.360* :  That will likely continue. Conservatives have promised to reverse the changes
*27:24.740- 27:26.200* :  if they get into power.
*27:28.520- 27:29.520* :  Jessica Parker.
*27:30.660- 27:32.080* :  Ideas are bulletproof.
*27:32.080- 27:36.680* :  The three words that now hang above the door of one of Hong Kong's most loved
*27:36.680- 27:39.260* :  independent bookshops which has been forced to close.
*27:39.580- 27:42.620* :  Hundreds of well wishes gathered to say their final goodbyes.
*27:43.040- 27:46.440* :  Margaret Ng is a former pro-democracy politician.
*27:46.440- 27:50.940* :  She says Mount Zero was a symbol of Hong Kong's fearless mindset.
*27:51.540- 27:52.480* :  This is the spirit.
*27:53.100- 27:55.400* :  And that spirit is unvanquished.
*27:55.660- 27:56.980* :  It does not disappear.
*27:56.980- 28:00.480* :  It does not become depressed because of all this.
*28:00.780- 28:02.980* :  Look at how cheerful people are.
*28:03.400- 28:05.040* :  They are totally undonted.
*28:05.300- 28:07.640* :  In fact, it's the fact that they have survived.
*28:08.260- 28:12.780* :  This kind of oppressive behavior is something to celebrate.
*28:13.360- 28:18.200* :  Critics say a new security law imposed by China means freedom of expression
*28:18.200- 28:20.720* :  in the territory is coming under further pressure.
*28:21.240- 28:25.420* :  Our BBC Asia Pacific Regional Editor Celia Hatton has more details.
*28:26.020- 28:29.620* :  Mount Zero is actually just the latest independent bookstore
*28:30.060- 28:31.520* :  that's closed in Hong Kong.
*28:31.560- 28:34.340* :  I know of two others that have been forced to close
*28:34.960- 28:36.880* :  in the past few months.
*28:37.620- 28:40.260* :  Mount Zero closed for the same reasons that the others have closed.
*28:41.040- 28:47.180* :  It was subject its owners say to increasing pressure from the authorities.
*28:47.260- 28:52.900* :  Almost weekly inspections by different branches of the Hong Kong government.
*28:52.940- 28:58.320* :  Some demanding to see their fire safety certificates.
*28:58.320- 29:02.480* :  Others demanding that they submit to food inspections,
*29:02.480- 29:04.000* :  even though they're bookstores.
*29:04.400- 29:08.300* :  And so it was kind of a constant litany of inspections.
*29:08.300- 29:13.340* :  And basically the message from the authorities was that they were being watched.
*29:13.340- 29:17.840* :  Mount Zero in particular was known for holding small events.
*29:17.840- 29:21.000* :  And police began showing up with video cameras,
*29:21.500- 29:23.760* :  saying that they were monitoring what was going on.
*29:23.760- 29:26.680* :  And so I think the owners of Mount Zero,
*29:26.680- 29:30.300* :  who at one point were very media friendly and were always willing to talk,
*29:30.300- 29:33.880* :  had recently gone underground become much more quiet.
*29:33.880- 29:38.100* :  They said in a social media post that they just simply couldn't put up with it anymore.
*29:38.360- 29:39.560* :  So what's the reaction being?
*29:39.880- 29:43.620* :  Well, it's a tricky one, Alex, because Hong Kong in general
*29:43.620- 29:48.100* :  has been subject to an increasing number,
*29:48.100- 29:50.440* :  really a massive security crackdown,
*29:50.440- 29:56.600* :  dating back to 2020 when China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong,
*29:56.600- 29:59.220* :  following huge pro-democracy protests there.
*29:59.680- 30:04.880* :  That first security law imposed by China really put a damper
*30:04.960- 30:07.120* :  on freedom of expression in the city.
*30:07.300- 30:11.880* :  And so under that shadow, we've seen these bookstore closures.
*30:12.080- 30:17.380* :  Hong Kong special status gave it its status as an international business center.
*30:18.240- 30:19.960* :  That's got to be under threat, hasn't it?
*30:20.180- 30:24.960* :  This new security law, we're seeing an instance in which taxi drivers are being encouraged
*30:24.960- 30:26.620* :  to listen into conversations,
*30:26.620- 30:31.160* :  held by their passengers and to report anything suspicious that they hear.
*30:31.580- 30:36.520* :  Christian priests have been told that if their parishioners come to them in a confession,
*30:36.520- 30:40.360* :  they must report anything that they hear in confessions.
*30:40.580- 30:43.360* :  And so this is a really dark time in Hong Kong,
*30:43.360- 30:47.660* :  and I think foreign businesses are reflecting alarm at those changes.
*30:48.100- 30:48.960* :  Celia Hatton.
*30:51.220- 30:53.600* :  And that's all from us for now,
