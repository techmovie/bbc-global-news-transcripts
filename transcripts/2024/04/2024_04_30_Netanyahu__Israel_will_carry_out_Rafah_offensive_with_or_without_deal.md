*01:19.100- 01:22.740* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.140- 01:28.380* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday,
*01:28.380- 01:30.940* :  the 30th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:30.940- 01:35.520* :  Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will carry out an operation in Ruffa,
*01:35.920- 01:39.520* :  regardless of whether a ceasefire deal is reached with Hamas in Gaza.
*01:40.140- 01:43.120* :  And a senior commander at the Islamic State Group in Africa
*01:43.540- 01:47.900* :  who had a $5 million US bounty on his head is reported to have been killed.
*01:47.900- 01:55.320* :  Also in this podcast, a leaked document obtained by the BBC says a teenager
*01:55.320- 01:58.200* :  who vanished during anti-government protests in Iran
*01:58.200- 02:02.520* :  was sexually assaulted and killed by men working for the security forces.
*02:03.100- 02:05.100* :  She was last seen running from the authorities.
*02:06.080- 02:10.420* :  For nine days, her mother searched for her, then she was called to identify her body.
*02:11.340- 02:13.020* :  Nika had massive head injuries.
*02:13.580- 02:18.260* :  And in the Gambia, a study has found that a stick-on measles vaccine patch
*02:18.600- 02:20.880* :  could be an effective alternative to injections.
*02:25.480- 02:30.440* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will carry out an offensive
*02:30.440- 02:36.400* :  against Hamas in Ruffa, regardless of whether or not a ceasefire and hostage release deal is reached.
*02:37.180- 02:41.860* :  In a statement from his office, he added that stopping the war before achieving the goal of
*02:41.860- 02:46.200* :  defeating Hamas was out of the question. Your land now reports from Jerusalem.
*03:11.260- 03:15.980* :  It has been offered to Hamas for a new ceasefire, expected to last for six weeks
*03:16.320- 03:18.380* :  in return for freeing Israeli hostages.
*03:19.180- 03:22.860* :  In other developments in the Middle East, the head of the United Nations aid agency
*03:22.860- 03:28.640* :  for Palestinian refugees, UNRA, has welcomed the restoration of funding by some donor countries
*03:28.960- 03:30.840* :  and urged others to follow suit.
*03:30.840- 03:36.320* :  But Philippe Lazareini also raised concern over the way Israel treats detainees.
*03:36.820- 03:39.500* :  People have told us that they are routinely rounded up.
*03:39.500- 03:42.760* :  When they were arrested, they were routinely rounded up,
*03:43.320- 03:48.060* :  stripped to the underwear and loaded into trucks, blindfolded and bombed.
*03:48.720- 03:54.680* :  Most of the time, once arrested, these detainees remain in Communicado
*03:55.260- 03:59.240* :  and they are subjected to shocking inhuman treatment.
*03:59.260- 04:04.820* :  Among the inhuman treatment, they have described to us waterboarding,
*04:04.820- 04:09.720* :  severe victims attacked by dogs, being forced to hold stress position
*04:10.140- 04:16.460* :  for hours, sometimes 12 hours, 24 hours, and being forced to wear diaper instead of
*04:17.320- 04:21.060* :  accessing the toilet. Among the detainees who have been released,
*04:21.100- 04:27.400* :  we had also a number of UNRA staff and they have also reported to us
*04:28.040- 04:31.260* :  that while on the interrogation, they were asked a lot of questions
*04:31.780- 04:37.040* :  about the walk-in with ONWA and basically also being pressure to stay.
*04:37.040- 04:42.040* :  The agency is politically affiliated in the Gaza Strip.
*04:42.460- 04:46.540* :  Our correspondent in Switzerland, Imogen Fokes, told us more about what he had to say.
*04:47.100- 04:53.220* :  He talked about the real fear in Raffa, where over a million garrisons have gone to hoping
*04:53.220- 04:57.920* :  it will be safe that there could be an Israeli attack. They are almost imminent.
*04:57.920- 05:02.000* :  You know, the Israeli government has said they do need to go into Raffa.
*05:02.000- 05:08.320* :  He said in Northern Gaza, where UNRA itself has not been able to deliver food since January,
*05:08.460- 05:15.460* :  there is its staff in the north report. There is some more food available in the markets.
*05:16.220- 05:22.200* :  It is still a race against time to avert famine. He has offered that as a bit of good news
*05:23.060- 05:30.940* :  and he seemed very pleased that he has managed to persuade countries to restore funding
*05:30.940- 05:36.800* :  that they suspended to UNRA Germany, for example, and he has new funding from other countries
*05:36.800- 05:43.140* :  and private funding. The financial security of the agency, Mr Lazarini thinks, is
*05:43.140- 05:49.180* :  secure at least for the next couple of months. How far was what he had to say an attempt to
*05:49.180- 05:54.320* :  further restore UNRA's good name, because it has obviously received quite a lot of criticism?
*05:54.940- 05:59.520* :  Absolutely. I mean, clearly that's what he wants to do. He is head of this organization.
*05:59.520- 06:06.240* :  I would add that you're in Geneva, the humanitarian agency, speak with one voice that UNRA can't
*06:06.240- 06:11.900* :  be replaced in the middle of a humanitarian crisis. It's the key agency on the ground.
*06:11.980- 06:19.140* :  But there is this UNRA investigation into those 19 UNRA staff that Israel says
*06:19.660- 06:26.020* :  took part in the October 7th attacks. That is ongoing. Most of them remain suspended.
*06:26.640- 06:32.640* :  One has been cleared, Mr Lazarini told us today, but clearly this is a damaged limitation
*06:32.640- 06:39.540* :  exercise with, from UNRA's point of view, a bit of good news that they are getting some funding
*06:40.060- 06:46.320* :  restored. Imogen folks. In Marley, the authorities say a commander of a West African affiliate
*06:46.320- 06:52.120* :  of the Islamic State group, Abu Huzafah, has been killed. Here's the announcement on State TV.
*06:57.280- 07:02.320* :  The Marley normally has succeeded, where armies said to be the most powerful in the world have failed.
*07:02.980- 07:07.600* :  Abu Huzafah, known as Higo, a foreign terrorist leader and internationally famous,
*07:08.080- 07:10.520* :  and who played the Sahel, has been neutralized.
*07:12.420- 07:18.380* :  Abu Huzafah, who had a $5 million US bounty on his head, was killed during a large-scale
*07:18.380- 07:24.320* :  operation involving forces from several countries. Over the past decade, attacks by groups linked
*07:24.320- 07:29.320* :  to Altaira and Islamic State have killed thousands of people in the region, and in the last 12
*07:29.320- 07:36.000* :  months, IS has expanded significantly in areas in northern Marley. Our Africa regional editor
*07:36.000- 07:41.840* :  is Will Ross. Abu Huzafah was, we believe, responsible for quite a lot of the attacks,
*07:41.900- 07:49.000* :  recent attacks in the Manaka region in North East Marley. He was also known as Higo,
*07:49.000- 07:55.060* :  and photos of him made him pretty distinctive with a very long beard, and he was one of several
*07:55.060- 08:01.340* :  commanders linked to the Islamic State group, whom the American authorities have put a bounty
*08:01.340- 08:08.920* :  on the head of because of a 2017 attack. People might remember an ambush in which several American,
*08:08.920- 08:14.680* :  four American, and at least four Nigerian soldiers were killed in a place called Tongo-Tongo,
*08:14.680- 08:20.000* :  that was an ambush. Since then, French officials had announced that one of the other leaders had
*08:20.000- 08:25.460* :  been killed in an airstrike, but as we heard in that clip earlier, the Marley and authorities
*08:26.140- 08:30.560* :  really kind of bragging a bit and saying powerful forces, what they were referring to was,
*08:30.820- 08:34.680* :  you know, the Americans were here, the French were here, they couldn't kill him, but we've managed
*08:34.680- 08:39.940* :  to kill him, and we understand this was a joint operation. Yes, it was, as far as we understand,
*08:39.940- 08:44.460* :  it was an international operation. There were several countries involved. Tell us about the
*08:44.460- 08:51.180* :  operation to bring him down. Well, what the State TV in Marley says is this was an operation
*08:51.180- 08:57.980* :  involving troops from Marley, Burkina, Faso, and Niger. Now, these three countries are all
*08:57.980- 09:05.780* :  under military rule. They've all basically been distancing themselves from former colonial power
*09:05.780- 09:11.880* :  France that was very active militarily in the region, and French troops have been booted out,
*09:11.880- 09:19.700* :  but there have also been ties cut with the United States. So, the fact that these three armies
*09:19.700- 09:24.420* :  are working together and saying that they've had some success against the Islamist militants is
*09:24.760- 09:29.460* :  significant. We don't obviously have a total proof of exactly what happened,
*09:29.500- 09:35.900* :  but these three countries, the military rule, are under a lot of pressure because the reason
*09:35.900- 09:42.500* :  they seized power, they said, was because the elected governments had failed to make any progress
*09:42.500- 09:48.040* :  stopping the Islamist militant attacks. So, it's all about insecurity, and can these three
*09:48.040- 09:53.040* :  countries that are now pretty close to Russia instead of United States and other Western countries,
*09:53.420- 09:58.220* :  can they make a difference in stopping the attacks and trying to protect communities,
*09:58.340- 10:04.580* :  because large areas of Marley, Burkina, Faso, and Niger are often targeted by these Islamist
*10:04.580- 10:11.500* :  militants. That was Will Ross. A teenager found dead during Iran's high profile anti-government
*10:11.500- 10:17.600* :  protests was sexually assaulted and killed by undercover agents working for Iran's security forces,
*10:17.940- 10:22.620* :  according to a leaked document obtained by a BBC World Service investigation.
*10:23.540- 10:29.800* :  Nika Sakharami was 16 when she disappeared in September 2022 after telling a friend
*10:29.800- 10:35.340* :  that police were chasing her. Her family found her body nine days later. The authorities denied
*10:35.340- 10:40.920* :  any involvement in her death, claiming that she took her own life. Reha Kansara has this report
*10:40.920- 10:46.660* :  from BBCI Investigations and a warning some listeners might find this distressing.
*10:51.580- 10:55.940* :  It's September 2022 and Iran is engulfed by the flames of protest.
*10:58.960- 11:05.020* :  The spark is the death and custody of a 22-year-old woman, detained for violating strict rules
*11:05.020- 11:13.760* :  requiring females to cover their hair in public. Her name, Masa Amini and her death ignites a movement
*11:13.760- 11:23.840* :  which spreads via social media. In Tehran, just days after Masa Amini's death, a 16-year-old girl
*11:23.840- 11:29.000* :  rises from a large demonstration. She climbs a dumpster into the chairs of the crowd,
*11:29.000- 11:34.080* :  she holds up her burning headscarf. She is Nika Sakharami.
*11:40.760- 11:46.040* :  Millions have since seen videos of her singing to friends and striking images of the teenager
*11:46.040- 11:55.140* :  in bold lipstick and dark eyeliner on social media. Back at the protest, she commands attention.
*11:56.260- 12:01.340* :  Undercover agents were watching her too, according to what appears to be a classified report from
*12:01.340- 12:06.660* :  inside Iran's security machine, obtained by the BBC. And like Masa Amini,
*12:07.120- 12:10.520* :  we're found she would soon be arrested and die in custody.
*12:12.820- 12:17.760* :  She was last seen running from the authorities. For nine days, her mother searched for her,
*12:18.240- 12:22.760* :  then she was called to identify her body. Nika had massive head injuries.
*12:23.760- 12:27.540* :  Now, through the leaked report obtained by BBCI investigations,
*12:27.540- 12:33.700* :  we're able to piece together what happened to Nika. Michael Simpkin is a producer with BBCI
*12:34.780- 12:39.080* :  investigations. It's never been published before and was drawn up by the Islamic Revolutionary
*12:39.080- 12:46.300* :  Guard Corps, or IRGC, an elite section of Iran's security service. It appears to be a summary of
*12:46.300- 12:52.100* :  a classified hearing into what happened to the teenager Nika. It includes names and testimony
*12:52.100- 12:55.960* :  of those who were with her when she was killed. This is some of what it says.
*12:56.920- 13:02.660* :  The undercover agents at the protest suspect Nika of being an organizer. The order is given
*13:02.660- 13:08.140* :  to arrest her. She is held in the back of an unmarked freezer truck with three members of that
*13:08.140- 13:15.100* :  team, referred to as team 12. Here is some of what they said spoken by actors. And a warning,
*13:15.100- 13:20.160* :  they describe a killing. I don't know what's happened, but after a few minutes,
*13:20.160- 13:26.520* :  she started swearing. I couldn't see anything. I could only hear fighting and bashing.
*13:27.360- 13:32.720* :  I turned on my phone light and saw Saada was sitting on her with his hands in her pants.
*13:32.960- 13:38.080* :  I never put my hand in her pants, but I can't deny that when I was sitting on her, I got
*13:38.080- 13:44.800* :  her out and touched her buttocks. She kicked out my face, so I had to defend myself.
*13:45.820- 13:50.540* :  From the front of the vehicle, the leader of team 12 haze the attack and stops the van.
*13:51.260- 13:56.340* :  When the radars are opened, he finds Nika's lifeless body. A senior commander is called to
*13:56.340- 14:02.620* :  report the incident. He tells them to dump the body on the street. The report concluded that
*14:02.620- 14:10.000* :  sexual assault caused the fight in the rear compartment. It's difficult to authenticate leaks
*14:10.000- 14:17.400* :  with many fake Iranian documents in circulation. But we've spent months cross-checking it
*14:17.400- 14:22.880* :  with multiple sources, including a former Iranian intelligence officer who has seen hundreds
*14:22.880- 14:27.920* :  of documents like this one. Is there any way that document could be a fake? No, it's nothing.
*14:27.920- 14:35.940* :  It's original and we accept that. It's not fake. While we can't confirm every detail,
*14:35.940- 14:42.300* :  overall, we believe it's genuine. As far as we can tell, the men responsible for Nika's death
*14:42.300- 14:47.780* :  have never been punished. Our investigation has found their commanding officer received a written
*14:47.780- 14:53.120* :  reprimand for ordering Nika's body to be dumped on the street, but has since been promoted.
*14:54.140- 15:00.140* :  We put our allegations to members of Team 12, the IRGC and the Iranian government. They did not
*15:00.140- 15:07.620* :  respond. You can watch the full investigation, Nika's last breath, on the BBC World Service YouTube
*15:07.620- 15:15.700* :  page. Measles is highly contagious and can kill. Since the COVID pandemic, the number of children
*15:15.700- 15:21.020* :  across the world who are being vaccinated against the disease has been falling. But could a small
*15:21.020- 15:27.760* :  patch offer a cheaper and easier alternative to Measles injections? It's been trialed in West Africa
*15:27.760- 15:31.920* :  in the Gambia, our health reporter, Michelle Roberts told us more about the patch.
*15:32.560- 15:38.180* :  When you look at it under the microscope, it's got these tiny, tiny little micro array needles
*15:38.180- 15:43.440* :  they call it. But it's not like your conventional needle that you jab in the arm that we have
*15:43.440- 15:48.940* :  other vaccines with. This one is getting around that. So it does look like a sticking plastic. You
*15:48.940- 15:53.620* :  just put on in the trial. They've left it for about five minutes on the skin. So it's not meant to
*15:53.620- 15:59.880* :  cause any discomfort or pain. So it really is a sticking plaster that can deliver these important
*15:59.880- 16:05.160* :  vaccines. And obviously that's a huge advantage over injections. You don't need needles or
*16:05.160- 16:10.900* :  syringes or medical stuff. Yeah, I mean, this is really important for places where it's hard to
*16:10.900- 16:16.900* :  physically get the vaccines out to the people. So you know, you can see how if you don't need all
*16:16.900- 16:23.160* :  of the refrigeration, all of the glass little vials, all of the things that can be quite problematic.
*16:23.780- 16:29.420* :  And also the needles themselves, you know, you can get a needle stick injury rarely. If you're
*16:29.420- 16:33.180* :  trying to give a vaccine to somebody, you need to be quite trained. Whereas with the sticking
*16:33.180- 16:38.160* :  plaster, you can see how more people would be able to administer it. And it would just be easier
*16:38.160- 16:44.380* :  to get out around the world. So just how big a trial is this? So they looked at around 240 young
*16:44.380- 16:50.380* :  children and toddlers and a handful of adults as well, just to see if it was doing what they were
*16:50.380- 16:55.640* :  hoping it was and it was. That being the case, when might it be possible to roll it out more
*16:55.640- 17:00.880* :  broadly? So they want to do a few more trials still. But they really are hopeful that they can get
*17:00.880- 17:06.880* :  this going. It's got some funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, London School of
*17:06.880- 17:11.080* :  Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been working on it with them, Unicef. There's also the hope that
*17:11.080- 17:18.760* :  you could do other diseases too. So you could do things like flu, HPV and also rabies. So it's got
*17:18.760- 17:25.760* :  a lot of potential. Mizzles is an incredibly contagious and dangerous illness. Why have rates
*17:25.760- 17:31.620* :  of child vaccination been falling? Obviously we had the COVID pandemic and that had a real knock-on
*17:31.620- 17:38.860* :  effect in getting all the other important vaccines out there to people. And we have seen around
*17:38.860- 17:44.460* :  the world a drop-off sadly in the number of young children that have been protected against
*17:44.460- 17:50.740* :  measles, mumps, rebeller, some of these really nasty childhood infections. And it's very concerning.
*17:51.940- 17:55.940* :  Mizzles is so contagious. So if you have people who are unvaccinated,
*17:57.000- 18:03.440* :  9 in 10 will catch it if they're exposed to it. It really is very, very contagious and it can
*18:03.440- 18:08.880* :  be extremely serious and deadly. So it really is important to get those vaccination rates up.
*18:09.520- 18:15.960* :  That was Michelle Roberts. When Dublin hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 30 years ago this week,
*18:15.960- 18:23.120* :  an unknown Irish dancer from Chicago was asked to perform as the interval act. Ireland won Eurovision
*18:23.120- 18:28.240* :  that year for the second year in a row. The country was on a winning streak, but it was the interval
*18:28.240- 18:34.060* :  act that stole the show. Michael Flatley's performance with River Dance dragged this centuries-old
*18:34.060- 18:39.100* :  traditional form of dance into the modern age and to a whole new audience and it launched a
*18:39.100- 18:44.140* :  multi-million-dollar show that has travelled the world ever since. The BBC's culture reporter,
*18:44.140- 18:50.200* :  Charlotte Gallagher, went to Dublin to meet him. Ladies and gentlemen, River Dance.
*18:58.260- 19:03.320* :  You're a vision. 1994 in Dublin. This was the interval act.
*19:03.660- 19:07.700* :  There was just something in the air that night. I could feel it. There's no way to explain it.
*19:07.700- 19:13.220* :  It was just so real and I was wound up like a slingshot ready to go.
*19:15.480- 19:22.460* :  And now, earth rise, Michael Flatley, going his mastery of the hard shoe tap.
*19:25.160- 19:30.720* :  30 years ago, you changed Irish dance. What are your memories of that evening?
*19:31.020- 19:36.360* :  My goodness that brings up a lot of memories. It was very, very special. I had been working my
*19:36.360- 19:42.640* :  whole life to change Irish dance and I didn't have the platform that I was dreaming of. There was
*19:42.640- 19:47.880* :  a lot of apprehension about somebody coming in and changing the form of dance in Ireland.
*19:47.880- 19:53.480* :  And in fact, right before I went on stage, they came to me and said, please, we're getting
*19:53.480- 19:58.120* :  calls from all the dance teachers. Please don't wave your arms around. You're going to make us look
*19:58.120- 20:02.800* :  ridiculous in front of the world and we'll be very embarrassed. So can we just ask you this time,
*20:02.800- 20:05.120* :  whatever happens, keep your arms out? And I said no.
*20:09.220- 20:13.400* :  And then a lot of people watching your version would have never seen Irish dancing before,
*20:13.660- 20:18.740* :  because there was people right across your, across the world. So it was that chance to show it to
*20:18.740- 20:25.460* :  the world and show what you can do. How cool is that? We nailed it. My dream, for 35 years,
*20:26.280- 20:31.880* :  I was working in construction sites and taking foundations in Chicago on those freezing cold
*20:31.880- 20:37.380* :  winters, but I was creating those steps in my dance style in my mind that whole time.
*20:37.380- 20:42.420* :  That's what got me through the hard labor was that bring this dance form to the world.
*20:42.460- 20:47.260* :  Some of our stars are from Hungary and Holland and from Asia, it's fabulous.
*20:47.940- 20:52.920* :  Being a young boy growing up in Chicago and wanting to dance wasn't easy for Michael.
*20:53.180- 20:58.740* :  I got bullied at school terribly, so I know what young lads go through and it's trying. It's
*20:58.820- 21:04.000* :  mentally difficult, it's stressful to have to walk into school and hope somebody doesn't say
*21:04.000- 21:10.160* :  something negative toward you. But if you look at our dancers now, men are so powerfully masculine
*21:10.160- 21:16.100* :  and they're just so buffed, cut, ripped. They're diet and they're training regimes. Everything is
*21:16.760- 21:20.580* :  specific and perfect. They've taken it to a whole new level.
*21:23.140- 21:28.220* :  Our guys, they're treated like rock stars when they come off the stage. You would not believe
*21:28.220- 21:33.680* :  the amount of people swarming around them for photos and signatures and that's my dream.
*21:34.380- 21:39.980* :  Irish dancing has now spread across the world with schools in China, South America, Africa,
*21:39.980- 21:41.600* :  and right across Europe.
*21:44.700- 21:49.500* :  And did you ever think 30 years later you'd be talking still about that moment?
*21:49.800- 21:53.120* :  To be honest with you, I'm delighted I'm even here at 30 years later.
*21:53.260- 21:59.200* :  At the face I was going, I never thought I would be so. Yes, I was always my dream.
*21:59.200- 22:01.720* :  I visualised it and I made it and I'm here.
*22:04.720- 22:11.920* :  Good grief. Half-prop of folk memories as small hairs rising in the back of every Irish man's neck.
*22:18.940- 22:22.280* :  The voice of Terry Wogan ending that report by Sean Gallagher.
*22:24.700- 22:25.780* :  Still to come in this podcast?
*22:25.780- 22:29.700* :  He wasn't sure democracy was all that it was cracked up to be he thought
*22:30.080- 22:33.200* :  the world would be a much better place if it was run by philosophers.
*22:33.500- 22:37.400* :  We've a fascinating insight into the final hours of the philosopher Plato.
*22:45.260- 22:48.080* :  Zimbabweans can use their new currency today.
*22:48.080- 22:52.780* :  It's called ZIG which stands for Zimbabwe Gold and is backed by the precious metal.
*22:53.400- 22:59.260* :  It's the latest attempt to stabilise Zimbabwe's volatile economy which has lurched from crisis to
*22:59.260- 23:05.140* :  crisis and hyperinflation over the past few decades. The ZIG replaces the Zimbabwean dollar
*23:05.600- 23:09.300* :  which lost 80% of its value against the US currency this year.
*23:09.900- 23:13.100* :  Our correspondent in Zimbabwe, Shengar Nyoka, told us more.
*23:13.740- 23:21.460* :  From early this morning there were a few people outside various banks and ATMs waiting to withdraw
*23:21.460- 23:28.880* :  the cash. The digital version of the ZIG has been in circulation since early April when it was
*23:28.880- 23:36.020* :  officially introduced and so yes people are transacting with the new currency but it must be said
*23:36.020- 23:42.040* :  that the US dollar which is also legal tender here accounts for about 80% of transactions.
*23:42.180- 23:49.420* :  And so most people tend to prefer to use the US dollar businesses prefer to accept the US dollar
*23:49.420- 23:55.160* :  rather than the local currency because it's easier to plan ahead and it's more stable.
*23:55.680- 24:00.920* :  So yes it's in use but I'm just not sure if people actually want this currency.
*24:01.260- 24:02.740* :  Which do you think is going to prevail?
*24:03.520- 24:07.540* :  The Zimbabwe dollar was scrapped in early April and it's been
*24:07.540- 24:14.180* :  take it replaced by the ZIG and that was because it had lost a significant value since it was
*24:14.180- 24:21.660* :  reintroduced in 2019 and so the ZIG is the sixth currency the sixth attempt by the government to
*24:21.660- 24:27.880* :  try to create a local stable domestic currency but Zimbabweans have already made that decision
*24:27.880- 24:34.720* :  they prefer to use the US dollar and so the central bank has admitted that it needs to try
*24:34.720- 24:39.960* :  to rebuild trust in the local currency that's why it's backed this currency by gold.
*24:43.080- 24:48.100* :  In Haiti a new transitional presidential council is choosing the country's new president.
*24:48.680- 24:52.920* :  It's hoped it will bring the nation under control amid escalating gang violence.
*24:53.680- 24:59.640* :  The new government's mandate is supposed to run until February 2026 by which time elections
*24:59.640- 25:05.760* :  should be held. Victoria O'Wallhunder spoke to former Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max
*25:05.760- 25:11.560* :  Belrieve and she started by asking him what he made of the new transitional council and what
*25:11.560- 25:19.220* :  led to its inception. There was a total institutional vacuum amenity, a president assassinated and
*25:19.220- 25:26.560* :  never replaced, a prime minister kept in exile, a government only virtually managing correct affairs,
*25:26.560- 25:32.980* :  a parliament of solid for years, even at the level of local authorities there were no elected
*25:32.980- 25:40.440* :  officials anymore. So there is a need to rebuild legitimacy to address the real challenge facing
*25:40.440- 25:47.060* :  nation people. Personally I would love to prefer something simpler, more in line with the spirit of
*25:47.060- 25:53.960* :  the Constitution and less under the influence of political forces which are ultimately involved
*25:53.960- 26:00.160* :  in the current crisis. For me it's like wanting to put a Ferrari engine to drive a tractor,
*26:00.420- 26:08.640* :  but that being said the debates must stop and decision must be made to follow, to allow hope,
*26:09.120- 26:14.720* :  to be reborn within a population that no longer knows where to turn. The international
*26:14.720- 26:21.220* :  communities is the presidential council, the necessary step to give birth to a government with
*26:21.220- 26:27.260* :  at least some legitimacy. When you say you will have preferred something simpler, what do you mean?
*26:28.160- 26:37.100* :  We are the several transition in 80 and in general we go to a way to install a president either
*26:37.100- 26:43.300* :  through the I call or by election by the Senate, but we don't have Senate right now.
*26:44.000- 26:49.560* :  One person representing the presidency would have been a better solution.
*26:50.120- 26:56.340* :  We've been hearing from gang leaders who say that the political class of which you used to be
*26:56.340- 27:03.120* :  part of have led down the people of Haiti, you yourself were designated by the U.S.
*27:03.120- 27:11.900* :  Department for participating in corrupt activities. How can the political class in Haiti regain
*27:11.900- 27:18.780* :  the trust of the people? I don't want to have a specific defense of my kids in that short
*27:18.780- 27:26.900* :  interview, but everything is explained by corruption. Corruption doesn't justify what I see in
*27:26.900- 27:33.680* :  80s today. I've traveled a lot in different countries, there is corruption everywhere, perhaps not
*27:33.680- 27:40.500* :  at the level of Haiti, but for me it's not good enough explanation. There is corruption, we have
*27:40.500- 27:47.080* :  to fight it, but just to explain the situation of Haiti today saying there are all corrupts,
*27:47.220- 27:53.020* :  for me is a shortcut that is not going to solve the problems of Haiti. Are you hopeful that
*27:53.020- 27:58.620* :  come February 2026 there will be a democratically elected government in Haiti?
*27:59.400- 28:07.920* :  We cannot continue to go down in to hell as we are right now in it. We have to find a way to work
*28:07.960- 28:13.480* :  together, we have to have a election before that we have to change the constitution, it's my
*28:13.480- 28:20.200* :  point of view, we have a two complex constitution that is not ready to resolve or actual problem.
*28:20.620- 28:25.140* :  So yes I'm hopeful, it can be done, it's possible if we work together.
*28:26.000- 28:34.080* :  Formation Prime Minister Jean-Marx Belrief. The collapse of a dam in Brazil in 2015 unleashed
*28:34.080- 28:40.880* :  millions of cubic meters of toxic mining waste sludge, burying villages and killing 19 people.
*28:41.520- 28:46.020* :  It was one of Brazil's worst environmental catastrophes, but nine years on,
*28:46.020- 28:51.100* :  the hundreds of thousands of mainly indigenous victims are still waiting for compensation.
*28:52.160- 28:57.800* :  The mine was owned jointly by Brazil's valley company and the Anglo-Australian mining firm
*28:57.800- 29:04.400* :  BHP. In January a Brazilian court ordered them to pay compensation for the damage caused,
*29:04.400- 29:11.280* :  and now both companies have agreed to pay $25 billion. Our America's regional editor Leonardo
*29:11.280- 29:15.680* :  Rocher told us more about how this environmental disaster unfolded.
*29:16.320- 29:23.100* :  Well that happened at the end of 2015 when this dam used by the mining companies to store waste,
*29:23.100- 29:31.180* :  toxic waste from iron or mining, just collapsed, collapsed on top of communities and the river
*29:31.720- 29:38.040* :  and the destruction cause was huge. 19 people died, could have been many many more,
*29:39.080- 29:44.260* :  but then what happened is the toxic waste using this, it's called the tailings dam,
*29:44.800- 29:49.860* :  went down the river and important river in the state of Minas Gerais and all the way to the Atlantic
*29:49.860- 29:57.420* :  ocean. At least 500 kilometers away east causing huge damage, hundreds of thousands of people
*29:57.420- 30:03.740* :  are affected somehow by this disaster and in many were directly affected. They lost the land,
*30:03.740- 30:10.040* :  they lost everything that they had to make matters worse, a few years later a similar accident
*30:10.080- 30:16.720* :  happened in the same area killing many more people. And it was mainly indigenous communities that
*30:16.720- 30:22.780* :  were affected. What other victims looking for and is this offer from the companies likely to satisfy
*30:22.780- 30:30.180* :  them? What this community say is that their way of life has been destroyed, has been ruined,
*30:30.180- 30:35.300* :  that is not coming back. What the government has been negotiating, the Brazilian government
*30:35.300- 30:42.760* :  was very forceful at the time, is a big settlement where they would try to restate the fauna,
*30:42.760- 30:48.980* :  the flora there, basically try to get people to where they were before and to give them financial
*30:48.980- 30:55.460* :  compensation. But there are many lawsuits in court in different parts of the world against those
*30:55.460- 31:01.200* :  companies because they are international companies. The perception in Brazil and the perception
*31:01.200- 31:08.100* :  from campaigns is that people have been abandoned, that very little has been done and that it's too
*31:08.100- 31:13.500* :  little too late for these people. The Brazilian government, they say they will reach a deal by the
*31:13.660- 31:19.580* :  middle of the year. What the company says is that they did the best and that's a risk that everyone
*31:19.580- 31:26.760* :  was willing to pay because it's a very profitable industry and when something like that happens,
*31:26.760- 31:33.100* :  they know they have to pay. Leonardo Rossho was speaking to Jeanette Gillil. Here in Britain,
*31:33.100- 31:38.740* :  King Charles has carried out his first public event since his cancer diagnosis. Accompanied by
*31:38.740- 31:43.920* :  Queen Camilla, he visited a cancer center at a London hospital where he met patients and medical
*31:43.920- 31:50.220* :  staff. This report from our Royal Correspondent, Johnny Diamond. The King looked happy to be out and
*31:50.220- 31:57.900* :  about in this his first public engagement since his cancer was announced 12 weeks ago. At University
*31:57.900- 32:04.340* :  College Hospital in central London, he stepped out into sunshine and then into the hospital as he
*32:04.340- 32:11.660* :  toured a cancer treatment centre with the Queen. Cheers greeted him as he went inside. There he met
*32:11.660- 32:18.040* :  staff and patients hearing about new treatments and from those like him receiving treatment.
*32:18.040- 32:24.860* :  Asked how he was, he said, I'm alright, thank you. Johnny Diamond. Now it was widely reported last
*32:24.860- 32:29.960* :  week that an Italian researcher had identified the location of the burial place in Athens
*32:29.960- 32:36.620* :  of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato after examining papyrus roles found in the Roman town of
*32:36.620- 32:42.920* :  Herculeanium. Well now, a fascinating nugget has emerged from the papyrus of how Plato apparently
*32:42.920- 32:48.800* :  spent his last moments. Paul Moss told us more. There were philosophers before Plato, but he's the
*32:48.800- 32:54.240* :  man who really lays out the agenda, the scope of the subject and also the sort of logical approach
*32:54.240- 33:00.060* :  which others followed. I should say Plato was a pupil of Socrates and much of what we get from Plato
*33:00.060- 33:03.400* :  is really just Socrates speaking. The older man would just wander around Athens,
*33:04.000- 33:09.000* :  pestering passes by winding them up with philosophical conundrums. Plato was the man who did the hard
*33:09.000- 33:14.500* :  graft of actually writing it down. He had too big interests, metaphysics, questions like what do we
*33:14.500- 33:20.540* :  know about reality? How can we be sure what appears to us is really there? Plato was also very
*33:20.540- 33:25.180* :  interested in politics. He wasn't sure democracy was all that it was cracked up to be he thought
*33:25.180- 33:31.060* :  the world would be a much better place if it was run by philosophers. Now so how exactly have we
*33:31.060- 33:36.060* :  learnt more about the man who lived two and a half thousand years ago? It really is incredible.
*33:36.060- 33:43.380* :  When Mount Vesuvius the volcano blew its top in 1879, it destroyed the nearby towns of Pompeii and
*33:43.380- 33:48.580* :  Herculaneum. One of the villas in Herculaneum was owned by a man who seems to be in a bit of an
*33:48.580- 33:52.740* :  intellectual. The house was full of scrolls a bit like nowadays when you go to someone's house
*33:52.740- 33:56.420* :  and they're showing off by having all sorts of clever books on the shelf. He was similar.
*33:57.120- 34:02.060* :  Tragically though the scrolls like everything else was burned to a cinder when Vesuvius erupted.
*34:02.940- 34:07.120* :  Incredibly as you were suggesting before scientists in Italy at the University of Pisa,
*34:07.580- 34:12.220* :  they found a way to read the scrolls using infrared light. Apparently there is a tiny
*34:12.220- 34:18.400* :  difference in the way infrared light is reflected on burned papyrus if it once had ink on it. It's
*34:18.720- 34:23.040* :  it really is as if you chucked a newspaper on a fire and found you could still read it afterwards
*34:23.340- 34:27.120* :  and amongst these ancient scrolls was description about Plato's life.
*34:27.340- 34:31.720* :  Okay so that's for how what have we learned? Well so far what for what they've deciphered as you
*34:31.720- 34:36.000* :  suggested what we've really learned is how his life ended. Now I should say why this has particular
*34:36.000- 34:41.500* :  fascination was because his teacher Socrates his death is regarded as one of the great moments
*34:41.500- 34:47.060* :  of ancient history. He paced around he'd been sentenced to drink poisonous hemiloc and right to
*34:47.060- 34:53.260* :  the end he reflected on life death the truthers of life. So people hope for something similar with
*34:53.260- 34:58.360* :  Plato but it turns out it was a bit different for his last moments. What we he learned is that
*34:58.360- 35:02.540* :  he invited a friend round and they hired a slave girl to dance and play the flute for them
*35:03.180- 35:08.900* :  and as he was gasping his final breaths Plato were told looked up and could play in that she didn't
*35:08.900- 35:14.340* :  actually have a very good sense of rhythm. So after a life of great profound reflection a death
*35:14.820- 35:20.300* :  coming after someone having a bit of a winch. That was our philosophy correspondent Paul Moss.
*35:22.940- 35:27.640* :  And that's it from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
