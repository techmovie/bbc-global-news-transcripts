*01:08.840- 01:10.620* :  Kote happy podcast today.
*01:11.320- 01:11.900* :  That's Olivia.
*01:12.380- 01:16.800* :  Her voice was in the film Moana, and she is welcoming you to the happy pod from the BBC
*01:16.800- 01:17.780* :  World Service.
*01:18.040- 01:25.600* :  I'm Jackie Lennard, and in this edition uploaded on Saturday, the 6th of April, are a
*01:25.600- 01:28.220* :  markable rescue from a frozen ravine in Finland.
*01:28.940- 01:34.660* :  This first thought was that, okay, it's not my time yet, so I get a chance to play with
*01:34.660- 01:35.240* :  my children.
*01:35.640- 01:38.960* :  How music is being used to help refugees heal from war?
*01:39.680- 01:44.620* :  Music is amazing to this soul, and music is a universal language.
*01:44.660- 01:48.580* :  The woman who turned a mugging in New York into a war-winning art.
*01:48.580- 01:52.700* :  Okay, great, so this terrible thing happened, I'm still kind of traumatised by it.
*01:53.080- 01:55.040* :  But hey, look at this beautiful poem I've made.
*02:01.500- 02:01.560* :  And in Japan.
*02:01.560- 02:04.200* :  In a feat that hasn't been seen in over a hundred years.
*02:09.480- 02:14.520* :  And we begin in a remarkable rescue in the frozen wilderness of Northern Lapland.
*02:14.880- 02:20.140* :  It is extremely cold there at this time of year, and so when a reindeer herder went missing
*02:20.140- 02:25.180* :  for two days after plunging into a ravine, it could have ended very badly indeed.
*02:25.780- 02:29.580* :  But that is where the skills of the indigenous Sami people come in.
*02:30.080- 02:35.460* :  Our reporters Anna and Harry spoke to journalists and Finnish resident Erika Benker about the
*02:35.460- 02:37.780* :  rescue and the remote area where it happened.
*02:38.420- 02:40.820* :  So it's Europe's last big wilderness.
*02:41.880- 02:46.120* :  I drove for an hour and a half on that road without seeing another car.
*02:46.720- 02:51.520* :  So it's very remote, not many roads, very difficult terrain.
*02:52.280- 02:55.420* :  There are hills and it's heavily forested.
*02:55.740- 03:00.080* :  And of course there's no mobile phone signal which made this situation even more difficult
*03:00.080- 03:01.160* :  for the reindeer herder.
*03:01.480- 03:03.140* :  Tell us about the rescue mission.
*03:03.740- 03:11.260* :  Yeah, so this reindeer herder, whose name is Aslak Ula Lensman, his snowmobile was caught
*03:11.260- 03:15.260* :  up in an avalanche and he found himself at the bottom of this gorge.
*03:15.680- 03:19.540* :  And the weather deteriorated, it was minus 30 degrees.
*03:20.540- 03:28.040* :  He said that luckily he had some matches, luckily he found some dry wood so he could make
*03:28.040- 03:28.580* :  a fire.
*03:29.440- 03:35.900* :  And he also had that space blanket, that thermal blanket that keeps you warm in extreme temperatures.
*03:36.160- 03:37.220* :  So luckily he had that.
*03:37.740- 03:42.880* :  So he couldn't alert the rescue services, but of course he was hoping that his family
*03:42.880- 03:47.600* :  and friends would raise the alarm and start searching for him, which is exactly what
*03:49.120- 03:49.140* :  happened.
*03:49.280- 03:49.680* :  So it's a very close-knit community.
*03:50.220- 03:55.080* :  And when he was found by other reindeer herders, he was basically half frozen.
*03:55.820- 04:00.780* :  They called the emergency services, who came with a helicopter, but a helicopter couldn't
*04:00.780- 04:01.080* :  land.
*04:02.180- 04:08.820* :  So the reindeer herders improvised a sled for him, so they used a plastic sheet, they wrapped
*04:08.820- 04:15.400* :  some mattresses and warm clothes around him and somehow managed to lift him out and
*04:15.400- 04:21.460* :  drag him to a snowmobile where they could drive him to the nearest road and an ambulance
*04:21.460- 04:22.680* :  could come to the road.
*04:23.160- 04:26.800* :  It's interesting, because as you've mentioned, there was an official rescue service that
*04:26.800- 04:31.460* :  tried to reach him and had a helicopter, but actually it was the locals, it was the
*04:31.460- 04:39.040* :  Sami people's expertise and local knowledge that they were actually better prepared to
*04:39.040- 04:39.680* :  rescue him.
*04:39.800- 04:40.180* :  Exactly.
*04:40.580- 04:45.560* :  He said himself after he was rescued, that it was down to the Sami people's skills.
*04:46.320- 04:52.540* :  And I can't emphasize enough how this local knowledge and the skills of Sami people
*04:52.540- 04:57.180* :  that are handed down from one generation to the next, how important they are.
*04:57.500- 05:03.200* :  Just without these old skills, you're just lost and you've never been found and rescued.
*05:03.660- 05:08.580* :  The Sami people, they know the terrain, they know the conditions and of course they were
*05:08.580- 05:10.600* :  best placed to find this man.
*05:10.940- 05:11.920* :  And how is he doing now?
*05:12.320- 05:15.320* :  Well, he was in hospital for a while, but he's out of hospital now.
*05:15.320- 05:21.700* :  He's a young man with three children and he said his first thought when he heard the
*05:21.700- 05:27.320* :  snowmobile coming towards him was that, okay, it's not my time yet.
*05:27.360- 05:31.200* :  So I get a chance to play with my children and see my children.
*05:32.160- 05:32.840* :  Erica Benker.
*05:33.780- 05:39.000* :  Now, part of an occasional series here on the HappyPod, celebrating the way people are preserving
*05:39.000- 05:41.480* :  small and threatened languages around the world.
*05:42.020- 05:46.600* :  This week we head to Tokalau, a tiny territory in the Pacific Ocean.
*05:54.140- 05:59.580* :  It's Olivia Foye singing in the island's language Oganana Tokalau.
*05:59.960- 06:04.460* :  She's a singer from New Zealand, but some of you might recognize her voice from the Disney
*06:10.600- 06:11.760* :  movie Moana.
*06:14.800- 06:22.380* :  The islands which sit roughly 500 kilometers north of Samoa are inhabited by just 1500 people
*06:22.380- 06:27.080* :  and Oganana Tokalau is classified as severely endangered.
*06:27.860- 06:33.420* :  Olivia is of Tokalau and Tuvalu and Descent and has been using her music to promote the
*06:33.420- 06:34.520* :  language of Tokalau.
*06:34.880- 06:39.220* :  She spoke to Harry Blye about the importance of preserving the language and the pride
*06:39.220- 06:40.740* :  she has in her heritage.
*06:41.380- 06:44.420* :  My grandparents would always speak a combination actually.
*06:44.420- 06:47.260* :  They mixed everything up so I was very confusing at first.
*06:47.800- 06:52.520* :  My grandfather Tokalau, my grandma Tuvalu and they spent a lot of time and raised children
*06:52.520- 06:56.860* :  in Samoa and then they moved to New Zealand, so they would kind of switch between languages
*06:57.420- 07:01.700* :  but overall once I realized the blessing I was, I found it very enriching.
*07:02.300- 07:07.420* :  Do you remember as a child when you first heard that language and you then made that decision
*07:07.420- 07:08.300* :  to learn it?
*07:09.460- 07:14.860* :  Yes, well my father, Opatai Foye, he made this band called Devaka and so he was always
*07:14.860- 07:20.240* :  using the language in his music and so it always sounded so beautiful to me and I got
*07:20.240- 07:25.720* :  to hear my family, especially my auntie, so lots of what Yamia Tu she would sing in
*07:25.720- 07:31.720* :  the language and I always thought it sounded so graceful and so powerful and so that definitely
*07:32.340- 07:36.280* :  inspired me to try and incorporate it and learn it and it was tough because I didn't
*07:36.420- 07:37.140* :  grow up speaking it.
*07:37.180- 07:41.800* :  I only heard it in songs and had to make a real effort to try and teach myself.
*07:42.800- 07:44.200* :  And let's talk about the song.
*07:44.380- 07:50.320* :  What was your inspiration behind writing it and what emotions did it evoke when you
*07:50.320- 07:52.140* :  started singing in that language?
*07:53.300- 07:59.180* :  The song Mayanamore definitely was filled with so many emotions.
*07:59.260- 08:05.300* :  I had never written a song fully for so it was huge on many fronts but it means from
*08:05.300- 08:05.840* :  the past.
*08:06.020- 08:10.720* :  The title Mayanamore means from the past and so it was very fitting that it was all in
*08:10.740- 08:13.120* :  a language that I had inherited from my ancestors.
*08:21.160- 08:26.020* :  And it talks about stories from the past, it talks about lessons that we can learn from
*08:26.020- 08:33.440* :  looking to the past, it talks about the power that we inherit from our lineage, it talks
*08:33.440- 08:38.320* :  about the land and natural resources and yeah it was very very important to write that
*08:38.480- 08:42.780* :  in Manatokalau even though I was still quite scared that I would get something wrong, I made
*08:42.780- 08:43.500* :  my best effort.
*08:48.720- 08:55.020* :  And of course you sang on the film Moana, a massive film that was popular with so many
*08:55.020- 08:56.540* :  kids all over the world.
*08:57.120- 09:03.700* :  How special was it for you to see not only Polynesian culture represented but also Gangana
*09:03.700- 09:06.440* :  Tokalau to be heard as well in music?
*09:08.260- 09:14.020* :  Well that was huge because even of the Pacific Islands, Tokalau is a minority minority you
*09:14.020- 09:20.520* :  know, I think it's a population of 1500 so to have that language in such a huge film and
*09:20.520- 09:27.100* :  be celebrated as the broader Pacific Island family was so beautiful and made me and my
*09:27.100- 09:31.620* :  family so proud but the fact that it's not just about Tokalau but it can be used as a
*09:31.620- 09:34.480* :  vessel to celebrate all of the Pacific, made me very happy.
*09:42.940- 09:48.380* :  It's such beautiful music, do you hope that it helps other people perhaps learn these
*09:48.520- 09:52.680* :  smaller languages like Gangana Tokalau or Tuvalua?
*09:53.700- 10:00.480* :  Yes of course, I think as time goes on it gets harder and harder to bring along you know
*10:00.480- 10:05.660* :  all of these beautiful languages with us and so we have to find spaces for them that
*10:05.660- 10:10.360* :  they can have a new life in the future and I feel that music is a beautiful place for
*10:10.360- 10:13.080* :  these languages to have new life and to shine.
*10:18.500- 10:19.620* :  Olivia Foye
*10:20.300- 10:26.480* :  Now to the story of Jamil and Tsar, two lions born in captivity in Ukraine and at last enjoying
*10:26.480- 10:31.760* :  a new life in South Africa, they had already been rescued once by a key of wildlife center
*10:32.060- 10:36.700* :  from woefully unsuitable conditions but after Russia's full scale invasion they were
*10:36.700- 10:37.620* :  in peril again.
*10:38.320- 10:41.560* :  Enter the charity Born Free which got them out of harm's way.
*10:41.960- 10:45.900* :  Our reporter Ella Bicknell spoke to Will Travers, the president of Born Free.
*10:46.600- 10:53.320* :  So these two lions Tsar and Jamil brothers were born into a Ukrainian zoo nearly three
*10:53.320- 10:53.940* :  years ago.
*10:54.400- 11:00.880* :  They were in poor shape, they were malnourished, they were sickly and then of course many animals
*11:00.880- 11:01.340* :  lives.
*11:01.540- 11:08.820* :  In fact the whole country was and is in jeopardy but for these two lions they were identified
*11:08.820- 11:15.800* :  by a Ukrainian animal welfare organization who managed to spirit them away temporarily
*11:15.800- 11:23.080* :  to a Polish zoo and then on to rescue center in Belgium called the Natural Help Center.
*11:24.260- 11:30.040* :  This is like a jigsaw and you put all the different pieces together and if you've done
*11:30.040- 11:34.300* :  it right you end up with a great picture and the picture now is a picture of health.
*11:34.300- 11:40.880* :  These two lions are in beautiful rescue center in South Africa where they will live
*11:40.880- 11:41.900* :  to the rest of their lives.
*11:41.900- 11:44.460* :  They will enjoy the best possible life that we can offer them.
*11:44.880- 11:49.300* :  If these lions had passports they would have more stumps in them than probably the average
*11:49.380- 11:50.120* :  human being.
*11:51.040- 11:56.440* :  I think you're right and of course you know it's not straightforward, not like UI want
*11:56.440- 12:00.680* :  to go somewhere, we buy our ticket, we get our visa if we need it, we sit on the plane
*12:00.680- 12:01.720* :  and get out the other end.
*12:02.180- 12:09.440* :  Each crate is handmade, is bespoke for the animal but then the crates are of a particular
*12:09.440- 12:14.860* :  size and when you get out the other end you can't just put them on another flight because
*12:14.860- 12:20.660* :  the door to the hold is too small so they won't fit through the door which is why we had
*12:20.660- 12:26.020* :  to road transport them from Johannesburg down to Shamwari near Port Elizabeth in the
*12:26.020- 12:26.600* :  Eastern Cape.
*12:27.020- 12:32.500* :  For such a logistically complicated process and emotionally I imagine it must be really
*12:32.500- 12:35.220* :  rewarding to see them all settled in in South Africa.
*12:36.220- 12:42.260* :  It is and that moved nearly 60 big cats over the years, we've released dolphins as well
*12:42.260- 12:49.420* :  into the wild, every time we do this it really is all about one, if you can make a difference
*12:49.420- 12:55.320* :  for that one animal and tell that story as we're doing now, people feel their spirit
*12:55.320- 12:55.660* :  live.
*12:56.340- 13:01.700* :  I know that Zahar and Jamil and the other big cats that live there for the rest of their
*13:01.700- 13:07.040* :  lives will have the best possible rest of their life, it's a second chance and if
*13:07.040- 13:08.640* :  this is certainly a life worth living.
*13:09.320- 13:12.080* :  We'll traverse the president of the charity Born Free.
*13:12.900- 13:17.320* :  Now we heard a little earlier from Olivia about how she harnesses music to celebrate her
*13:17.320- 13:22.860* :  culture and this next report from a refugee camp in Northwestern Uganda is about the
*13:22.860- 13:27.160* :  power of music too, this time it's healing and unifying potential.
*13:27.680- 13:29.580* :  Our reporter is Maira Anuba.
*13:32.780- 13:38.160* :  Let me take you to Bidi Bidi in Uganda, one of the largest refugee camps in Africa, it's
*13:38.160- 13:44.440* :  home to over 200,000 refugees, mostly from the civil war over the border in South Sudan.
*13:48.520- 13:53.640* :  That's Victor Alonzi, teaching a group of children to play a stringed instrument called
*13:53.640- 13:59.940* :  an adungu, he's a teacher for the Salam music program set up by the refugee charity
*13:59.940- 14:01.380* :  Sina Loketa.
*14:01.900- 14:09.260* :  Well music is a medicine to the soul and music is a universal language, we're using it as
*14:09.260- 14:12.760* :  a great tool to foster social change.
*14:13.360- 14:18.860* :  The reason as to why we have the refugees in Bidi Bidi is because of the civil war and
*14:18.860- 14:27.020* :  the civil war really had a lot to do with this integration of no more pattern of the community.
*14:27.820- 14:34.160* :  So we are doing music to build cohesion and to build peace among different communities.
*14:34.920- 14:40.760* :  In the camp we have tribes who could not in Tamari, we had tribes who could literally
*14:41.580- 14:46.160* :  not buy from the same market, who couldn't go into the same schools.
*14:46.760- 14:53.420* :  So when we started the music activities, it created a social environment where different
*14:53.420- 14:58.280* :  young people started gathering together and realizing one interest which is music.
*14:58.800- 15:05.260* :  So as time went by, we realized actually the element of hatred started vanishing.
*15:11.760- 15:15.740* :  Many of the people here have fled from a violent and bloody conflict.
*15:16.320- 15:20.000* :  So how does Victor use music to help and deal with this trauma?
*15:20.580- 15:26.060* :  One of the ways actually music really helped to make people heal the traumatic conditions
*15:26.060- 15:30.180* :  and depression and stress has been involved in the activity.
*15:30.800- 15:36.580* :  Young people started getting engaged in learning different instruments, singing and learning
*15:36.580- 15:37.040* :  vocals.
*15:37.620- 15:44.980* :  So these kept young people busy and their minds started creating a path of recovery other
*15:44.980- 15:48.020* :  than getting depressed somewhere, other than getting into drug abuse.
*15:48.420- 15:54.460* :  And then also coming up with songs that brings about positive energy.
*15:59.520- 16:04.600* :  It is one of the artists who recorded a song called Anina del Salam, meaning we need peace.
*16:05.120- 16:11.040* :  This song talks about how terrible work can be and then how coming together and to speak
*16:11.040- 16:17.740* :  against discrimination and to speak against conflict and fighting could actually help bring
*16:17.740- 16:18.460* :  people together.
*16:19.320- 16:24.260* :  Victor Alonzi in the Biddy Biddy Camp in Uganda ending that report by Myra Anuba.

*17:04.860- 17:09.460* :  The future isn't scary, not realizing its potential, however, could be.
*17:09.780- 17:14.900* :  Just like on the recruiting trail, I've seen potential come in many forms as a coach.

*17:20.780- 17:22.340* :  Invesco Distributors Inc.
*17:24.680- 17:26.520* :  A lot can happen in the next three years.
*17:26.840- 17:28.960* :  Like a chatbot, maybe your new best friend.
*17:29.380- 17:30.300* :  But what won't change?
*17:30.640- 17:31.560* :  Meeting health insurance.
*17:31.920- 17:35.320* :  United healthcare try to or medical plans are available for these changing times.
*18:01.400- 18:05.920* :  Now, this next story is an astonishing example of spinning positivity out of something
*18:05.920- 18:06.880* :  really awful.
*18:07.200- 18:12.200* :  You might have heard mention of Imogen Wade, a woman who turned her traumatic mugging in New
*18:12.200- 18:14.220* :  York into an award-winning poem.
*18:14.580- 18:18.440* :  I told people that the travel sickness pills made me stupid.
*18:19.300- 18:23.680* :  I entered JFK with a red suitcase, and no one to greet me.
*18:24.260- 18:26.580* :  A man came up to me, dressed in black.
*18:27.480- 18:32.680* :  I found myself in a car park by an expensive van, and he was holding my luggage.
*18:33.560- 18:37.340* :  Getting, he said, there wasn't a single thought in my head.
*18:37.740- 18:42.500* :  That's Imogen reading her winning piece, which beat nearly 20,000 other entries and earned
*18:42.500- 18:44.320* :  her a $6,000 prize.
*18:44.380- 18:49.400* :  She has been talking to our own Harry and begins at the dreadful moment when she realized
*18:49.400- 18:54.320* :  that the blacked out van she got into at JFK airport wasn't a taxi after all.
*18:54.740- 18:57.620* :  He looks the doors, and I thought, well, I'm going to die now.
*18:57.900- 19:01.780* :  And he just kept looking at me as if to say, like, I can do anything right now.
*19:02.160- 19:06.500* :  And it was this unspoken, undercurrent that we were going down this alley at five miles
*19:06.500- 19:10.460* :  an hour in this tinted van, and he was, this guy was massive as well.
*19:10.620- 19:14.920* :  And he pulled up outside the back entrance to Grand Central, and I think, oh, my God,
*19:14.920- 19:15.620* :  I know where I am.
*19:17.400- 19:17.460* :  This is brilliant.
*19:17.660- 19:18.360* :  He's going to let me out now.
*19:18.400- 19:18.820* :  Fantastic.
*19:18.820- 19:19.180* :  Just a weird guy.
*19:19.800- 19:22.260* :  And I try and get out of the van, and the door still locked.
*19:22.880- 19:24.760* :  And as it says in the poem, he turns to me.
*19:24.980- 19:25.720* :  And this is real.
*19:25.720- 19:26.640* :  You know, he's in real life.
*19:26.640- 19:27.380* :  He goes to me.
*19:27.820- 19:31.240* :  Don't get out because there are some really bad people around.
*19:31.420- 19:35.740* :  Because if he's trying to protect me, but the only person he protection from obviously
*19:35.740- 19:36.320* :  is him.
*19:36.320- 19:41.700* :  So then he gets out quickly, then relocks the door, goes around to the boot, pushes my suitcase
*19:41.700- 19:43.640* :  forward, makes me unzip it.
*19:44.180- 19:48.820* :  And then if my granddad had given me some of his pension money to this guy, I just said,
*19:48.820- 19:49.660* :  oh, gave me this room.
*19:49.660- 19:50.580* :  I can't remember the number now.
*19:50.580- 19:53.060* :  It's a ridiculous number of money I had to give him.
*19:53.620- 19:54.840* :  But I happen to have it on me.
*19:54.840- 19:58.460* :  So I thought, I'd rather give him all the money than be hurt.
*19:58.960- 20:00.600* :  He then helps me out of this van.
*20:01.020- 20:06.540* :  Like he's kind of chivalously holds my luggage, leads me up to the door of the station.
*20:07.360- 20:09.100* :  And in real life, he actually shook my hand.
*20:10.460- 20:16.460* :  And then he walked away laughing, gets in his van and speeds off into the night, leaving
*20:16.460- 20:20.660* :  me on the door of the station, feeling pretty shaken.
*20:21.300- 20:27.980* :  Take me through the process of writing this poem about what was a pretty traumatic
*20:28.780- 20:29.220* :  ordeal?
*20:29.580- 20:31.280* :  Yes.
*20:31.280- 20:32.180* :  So I'm a therapist.
*20:32.180- 20:35.880* :  And so I think a lot about processes of therapeutic reflection and how art might be
*20:35.880- 20:37.560* :  able to help people heal from things.
*20:38.280- 20:42.500* :  And so there's something therapeutic and only about writing out what I went through,
*20:43.140- 20:44.960* :  but also creating something beautiful.
*20:45.400- 20:49.960* :  Well, my favorite phrase in life is, when life gives you lemons, make poems.
*20:50.960- 20:51.400* :  I like that.
*20:51.540- 20:53.560* :  And I had made this poem that was a lemon.
*20:53.980- 20:55.560* :  I had ever been thinking, okay, great.
*20:55.560- 20:56.920* :  So this terrible thing happened.
*20:57.220- 20:58.700* :  I'm still going to traumatise by it.
*20:59.140- 21:01.060* :  But hey, look at this beautiful poem I've made.
*21:02.040- 21:03.280* :  Let's go to the present day.
*21:03.280- 21:08.980* :  How did it feel to win the national poetry competition?
*21:09.080- 21:12.180* :  You got first prize for your lemon, your poem.
*21:13.120- 21:14.080* :  What was that moment like?
*21:14.800- 21:21.720* :  So they called me on the phone and I said, oh my god, probably about 17 times in a sequence
*21:21.860- 21:22.600* :  without pause.
*21:22.960- 21:26.840* :  And then they replied, oh, well, we're so happy to, how happy you are.
*21:27.380- 21:30.440* :  And I said, happy, I'm very of a well right now.
*21:30.460- 21:36.500* :  I just didn't believe it because I have been writing poetry for about 15 years since
*21:36.500- 21:37.660* :  I was 10 years old.
*21:38.200- 21:43.240* :  And my dream had just to be commended and then to actually have won it, especially for
*21:43.240- 21:43.680* :  this poem.
*21:43.840- 21:47.260* :  This poem that meant so much to me, I was really overwhelmed by it.
*21:47.860- 21:52.440* :  And I actually emailed them and I said, hi, I'm so sorry, but I think I am blanked
*21:52.440- 21:53.460* :  house on the phone call.
*21:53.740- 21:55.600* :  Can you just confirm to me what you said?
*21:56.600- 22:01.600* :  Because I honestly thought I just don't believe it and they replied, er, dot, dot, dot.
*22:01.780- 22:03.660* :  You came first, exclamation mark.
*22:04.060- 22:04.760* :  That's brilliant.
*22:04.760- 22:05.780* :  I've got it in writing now.
*22:05.960- 22:06.520* :  It must be true.
*22:06.520- 22:07.260* :  It must be true.
*22:08.000- 22:09.680* :  Imagine Wade talking to Harry Bly.
*22:10.260- 22:12.080* :  And we returned to our musical theme now.
*22:12.360- 22:16.480* :  This time a group of Australian medical students who are using their very limited spare
*22:16.480- 22:22.140* :  time and their talents to help others performing as a string quartet in an oncology
*22:22.140- 22:25.660* :  ward on the gold coast to try to lift the patient's spirits.
*22:26.120- 22:27.700* :  Stephanie Prentice has this report.
*22:32.300- 22:39.880* :  The sounds of a string quartet echoing through the perfect acoustic setting of a hospital corridor.
*22:41.160- 22:44.240* :  We just found a few people who played string instruments.
*22:44.560- 22:50.120* :  Amy is a medical student and violinist and while she may not be able to operate on patient
*22:50.120- 22:55.780* :  yet, she wanted to help them in another way, gathering with three other students to put
*22:55.800- 22:59.580* :  on regular performances at the gold coast university hospital.
*22:59.800- 23:03.320* :  We wanted to make an ensemble together so that we could collect and play thinking
*23:03.320- 23:06.040* :  of ways to do some good without music.
*23:06.640- 23:08.480* :  And the music is doing good.
*23:08.900- 23:13.140* :  Patients who are stuck in bed say they can hear the comforting sounds and those who can
*23:13.140- 23:15.420* :  move around come and get a front row seat.
*23:15.920- 23:20.720* :  I've got various things happening inside of the body that grow and probably eventually
*23:22.540- 23:23.260* :  put it into you.
*23:23.260- 23:29.060* :  So what better way to go out than the beautiful sounds of these young people in the string quartet?
*23:32.240- 23:33.460* :  I thought I was in the wrong place.
*23:34.620- 23:36.980* :  I thought I'm not in the concert hall.
*23:37.140- 23:38.420* :  It's live music.
*23:38.460- 23:43.200* :  You can always tell live music is compared to something that comes out of electronics and
*23:43.300- 23:43.640* :  speakers.
*23:44.940- 23:49.640* :  Experts say music can help humans with less individualistic thinking, like worrying
*23:49.640- 23:54.940* :  about problems, something that can help people with cancer get respite from their condition.
*23:55.260- 24:00.400* :  As for the medical students, they say it's not easy balancing their schedule with volunteering,
*24:00.960- 24:03.800* :  but they always make the time for their fortnightly performance.
*24:04.480- 24:08.680* :  A lot of times in medicine, if you don't give the time to volunteer, you will spend it
*24:08.700- 24:10.140* :  all to study.
*24:10.640- 24:14.360* :  And I think volunteering is great opportunity to just take a step back, but I think give
*24:14.360- 24:14.560* :  that.
*24:15.180- 24:20.240* :  Laura, who runs the programme, says it's here to stay, even when these students graduate.
*24:20.840- 24:25.520* :  The music really does give them a sense of joy, a sense of community and belonging, and
*24:25.520- 24:28.460* :  that's for both the people listening, but also the people playing the music.
*24:31.160- 24:36.120* :  Despite the setting, there's nothing but smiles as the group wrap up, promising more
*24:36.120- 24:39.240* :  front row seats to their fans for their next round of classics.
*24:39.620- 24:41.760* :  And yes, they even take requests.
*24:43.400- 24:49.080* :  That report by Stephanie Prentice, now across to Japan and a triumph in the world of sumo
*24:49.100- 24:49.480* :  wrestling.
*25:04.420- 25:05.240* :  I think he's excited.
*25:05.680- 25:10.680* :  What was going on there was 24-year-old Takarofuji winning the sport's premier competition,
*25:10.680- 25:15.980* :  the Emperor's Cup in Osaka, becoming the first competitor to win on his debut for more
*25:15.980- 25:16.640* :  than a century.
*25:17.020- 25:17.660* :  This is Ryan.
*25:17.980- 25:18.580* :  My name is Jake.
*25:18.940- 25:19.760* :  My name is Mac.
*25:20.600- 25:23.580* :  And they are from the grand sumo breakdown podcast.
*25:23.620- 25:27.060* :  They calmed down just enough to talk to our reporter, Jacob Evans.
*25:27.660- 25:34.240* :  This is really like a once-in-a-lifetime event that we've kind of seen for not only him
*25:34.240- 25:38.380* :  winning in his debut, but how quick he did all of this.
*25:38.660- 25:43.260* :  And likely we're not going to see this replicated in our lifetime with all the circumstances.
*25:44.000- 25:49.120* :  So yeah, the way the divisions work in sumo is actually very similar to association soccer.
*25:49.600- 25:54.020* :  The top division referred to as Makuchi is effectively like the Premier League.
*25:54.020- 25:56.060* :  If you don't do well enough, you get relegated down.
*25:56.620- 25:59.740* :  And the lower divisions, if you do well enough, you get promoted to the next one up.
*26:00.160- 26:04.540* :  It's like a team getting promoted to the Premier League like a year after being created
*26:05.220- 26:06.320* :  and then winning the whole thing.
*26:06.620- 26:09.080* :  It's absolutely monument to what this new wrestler did.
*26:09.440- 26:11.160* :  So how did the sumo world react to this?
*26:11.300- 26:12.320* :  Was it a big surprise?
*26:13.660- 26:14.880* :  Yeah, I would say so.
*26:14.880- 26:20.280* :  Like we said, this is something that hasn't happened in over a hundred years.
*26:20.800- 26:28.480* :  And yeah, a lot of people very, very excited to see what this guy can do having risen so
*26:28.480- 26:29.900* :  fast through the lower ranks.
*26:29.900- 26:34.800* :  And then the second he's in the top salary ranks, he wins the tournament.
*26:35.440- 26:39.060* :  And I understand Takrificey almost at the polite of this competition, didn't he?
*26:40.020- 26:40.320* :  Yes.
*26:40.320- 26:40.420* :  Yes.
*26:42.140- 26:46.560* :  On day 14, he entered himself against former Ozeki Austin Yammy.
*26:46.560- 26:48.040* :  He heard his right ankle.
*26:48.260- 26:52.360* :  And I know a lot of us were like, oh no, no, no, no, don't let the tournament end like
*26:52.360- 26:52.700* :  this.
*26:53.320- 26:55.640* :  Yeah, he went to the hospital, got it looked at.
*26:55.820- 26:58.500* :  And it was very doubtful that he would show up.
*26:58.740- 27:00.000* :  But regardless, he showed up.
*27:00.220- 27:04.320* :  He definitely didn't look a hundred percent, but he didn't look nearly as bad as he did
*27:04.760- 27:05.740* :  right after the injury.
*27:05.940- 27:08.960* :  He showed up on the last day, which was a surprise to everybody.
*27:08.960- 27:12.560* :  And he beat a very solid competitor to clinch his title there.
*27:12.880- 27:18.200* :  And so for you guys who love sumo and follow sumo, how exciting is it for you to see a new
*27:18.200- 27:22.940* :  breed of sumo wrestlers enter the scene and see someone like Takrificey winning on debut?
*27:22.980- 27:28.160* :  And also, you know, people noticing this and talking about sumo, but we love it.
*27:29.860- 27:35.500* :  We've been watching sumo since 2016 and we've been podcasting since 2017.
*27:36.220- 27:41.780* :  And really, it seems like sumo is in a really unique era right now, seeing this crop of
*27:41.780- 27:46.340* :  Taketu Fuji really feels like these are going to be the guys that we're going to be seeing
*27:46.340- 27:50.020* :  for the next decade, defining the decade of sumo.
*27:50.220- 27:53.120* :  So it's an exciting time, it's an exciting time to be sumo fans.
*27:53.800- 27:57.140* :  The grand sumo breakdown team, Ryan, Jake and Mac.
*27:57.740- 27:59.940* :  And our congratulations to Takrificey too.
*28:04.480- 28:10.480* :  And that's it from us for now, but we leave you with an A-way proverb sent in by James
*28:10.480- 28:12.560* :  Agblivore in Acra Garner.
*28:13.040- 28:15.440* :  Good news is the ears favorite dish.
*28:15.700- 28:16.460* :  It certainly is James.

*28:30.500- 28:31.380* :  and Jacob Evans.
*28:31.820- 28:33.340* :  Our editor is Karen Martin.
*28:33.920- 28:34.580* :  Thank you for listening.
*28:42.980- 28:44.880* :  Do you ever feel like your brain is on overdrive?
*28:45.280- 28:46.420* :  In your mind is constantly racing?
*28:46.460- 28:48.940* :  The plans worries and to do lists are never ending.
*28:49.620- 28:53.040* :  Calm can help your mind take a break from the noise by softening anxiety symptoms in
