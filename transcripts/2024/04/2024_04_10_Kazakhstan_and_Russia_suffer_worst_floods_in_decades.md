*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:20.100* :  by advertising. The people and projects trying to make our world a better place.
*00:20.480- 00:25.060* :  And also the problem. And I knew that there is a way we can use technology to solve it.
*00:25.300- 00:28.380* :  People fixing the world from the BBC World Service.
*00:34.000- 00:37.240* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:38.420- 00:41.560* :  I'm Andrew Peach, and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday,
*00:41.560- 00:46.720* :  the 10th of April, these are our main stories. Nearly 100,000 people have been forced from
*00:46.720- 00:51.780* :  their homes in Kazakhstan by what's been described as the worst flooding in almost a century.
*00:52.460- 00:55.900* :  A significant meeting has taken place between Taiwan and China.
*00:55.900- 01:00.720* :  President Xi has hosted the former leader of Taiwan in the first such meeting in Beijing
*01:00.720- 01:02.820* :  since the founding of Communist China.
*01:04.920- 01:07.920* :  Also in this podcast, they say it's the taking part that counts,
*01:07.920- 01:13.120* :  but now some Olympic gold medalists in Paris will get prize money as well as medals.
*01:13.640- 01:16.660* :  We're going to tell you what to do when you're angry. And?
*01:22.320- 01:24.280* :  I would like to speak in Polish.
*01:24.780- 01:29.060* :  Now we can all speak in any language in our own voice thanks to AI.
*01:32.460- 01:37.080* :  We start in Kazakhstan where more towns and cities across the country and in southern Russia
*01:37.080- 01:40.820* :  are being evacuated following the worst flooding in the region in decades.
*01:40.860- 01:46.040* :  Tens of thousands of people have been forced from their homes due to melting snow caused by
*01:46.040- 01:50.980* :  unseasonally warm temperatures. The Russian authorities are facing criticism over their response
*01:50.980- 01:56.240* :  in some of the worst-hit areas in the city of Orsk protesters gathered shouting shame.
*02:00.160- 02:04.040* :  The Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned the situation was
*02:04.080- 02:04.980* :  likely to get worse.
*02:08.780- 02:14.300* :  So far, the forecast is not favorable. The water level continues to rise.
*02:14.840- 02:17.980* :  A large amount of water is reaching new regions,
*02:17.980- 02:24.920* :  Kurgang, Chim√©n. So the situation is very tense, which of course requires the most energetic
*02:24.920- 02:28.820* :  efforts from government officials at all levels to help the people.
*02:29.220- 02:33.380* :  I asked Oleg Bollerayev of BBC Russian what's happening on the Russian side of the border.
*02:34.060- 02:38.560* :  We're now getting to pour some Orenburg, the capital of Orenburg region in the southern
*02:38.560- 02:44.220* :  Urals. People there are prepared to be evacuated. The waters of the Ural River, which caused so
*02:44.220- 02:48.740* :  much trouble upstream, have passed the official critical mark of 930 centimeters.
*02:49.180- 02:53.920* :  The news from there are not as bad as from Orsk, which lays a few dozen kilometers upstream.
*02:53.920- 03:00.340* :  There in Orsk, 7,000 homes have been filled with water to the brim and the consequences are
*03:00.340- 03:04.520* :  truly catastrophic. And there's more reporting from the Russian side than the Kazakh side of
*03:04.520- 03:09.760* :  the mountains, where the emergencies ministry have announced that 100,000 people have been evacuated.
*03:10.320- 03:15.600* :  Yes, inevitably, Ural River will carry its waters a few dozen more kilometers and then across the
*03:15.600- 03:21.500* :  border into Kazakhstan. Authorities there seem to be more prepared. I must confess the first warnings
*03:21.500- 03:26.800* :  of dangerous flood situation, which I heard, were coming from Kazakhstan, not from Russia. So I assume
*03:26.800- 03:32.280* :  the river flows in a different direction. But as you said, up to 100,000 people, that indicates
*03:33.000- 03:38.000* :  more preparedness because there's more people being evacuated. Certainly, the biggest Kurdish
*03:38.000- 03:42.640* :  isn't towards Russian authorities in Orsk is that there's been such an insufficient warning.
*03:42.860- 03:48.300* :  You tell me yesterday that the floodwaters had peaked, but then there's still plenty of snow
*03:48.300- 03:55.900* :  there to melt. Yes, there is a large hydroelectric dump upstream and it's regulating the flow to
*03:55.900- 04:01.660* :  some extent, but obviously needs to dump some water. And it seems to be a miscoordination between
*04:01.660- 04:06.960* :  authorities where a large amount of water started to be dumped. Somebody should have told the people
*04:06.960- 04:14.460* :  of Orsk to be prepared. Orsk has seen catastrophic floods before the one in 1957. People say it was
*04:14.640- 04:20.200* :  just as bad as this one. So they've built this dam made of earth and we're hoping that this will
*04:20.200- 04:26.020* :  contain the water. But as early as the fourth of the fifth of April, it was evident that the water
*04:26.280- 04:32.980* :  is starting to destroy that embankment. And even then, the authorities were saying that things
*04:32.980- 04:37.380* :  are in order, which they obviously weren't. And you've got people in Russia protesting about the
*04:37.380- 04:42.120* :  government response asking for Vladimir Putin to do more. Some people want him to come to the region.
*04:42.440- 04:48.660* :  Do you think you will? I don't think you will. Vladimir Putin does not like to appear in active
*04:48.660- 04:54.920* :  disaster zones. It goes way back to the events of Kursk submarine, which drowned in the
*04:54.920- 05:00.220* :  barren sea. And Mr Putin learned a hard way speaking to the furious relatives of those
*05:00.220- 05:05.940* :  sailors who drowned. So he might come to this region, but only after the event stabilized,
*05:05.940- 05:11.380* :  and he would be able to present himself as a man in control and against the backdrop of things
*05:11.380- 05:17.420* :  being done. It will take many, many weeks and months for the consequences to be repaired.
*05:17.420- 05:22.160* :  Right now, people are waiting for the water to leave their houses. This will happen in a few
*05:22.160- 05:26.200* :  days. And when they come back, obviously, they will find all their possessions destroyed.
*05:26.640- 05:32.860* :  Oleg Baldirov from BBC Russian. Six months into the Israel Gaza war, the US is hardening its
*05:32.860- 05:38.380* :  stance against the way Israel is conducting itself. In his strongest words yet, President Biden,
*05:38.380- 05:43.500* :  said he thought Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach was wrong. The comments mark a
*05:43.500- 05:48.860* :  significant shift from his previous position that it was up to Hamas to agree to a truce and release
*05:48.860- 05:55.680* :  Israeli hostages. I think what he's doing is a mistake. I think it's outrageous that those
*05:55.680- 06:01.700* :  three vehicles were hit by drones on a highway where it wasn't like it was along the shore.
*06:01.700- 06:09.460* :  It wasn't like it was a convoy moving in, etc. So what I'm calling for is for the Israelis to
*06:09.760- 06:19.420* :  just call for a ceasefire, allow for the next six, eight weeks total access to all food and medicine
*06:19.420- 06:25.040* :  going into the country. Our correspondent in Jerusalem Hugo Bashager assesses President Biden's
*06:25.040- 06:30.200* :  remarks. These are the strongest comments yet by President Biden who has offered unconditional
*06:30.200- 06:36.200* :  support for the Israelis in this war. We know that there is now a proposal that's been made after
*06:36.200- 06:42.960* :  the latest round of mediator talks in Cairo. Now, the center of this proposal is the idea of
*06:43.240- 06:49.880* :  40 hostages being freed. Hostages were being held in Gaza. In return, 900 Palestinians would be
*06:49.880- 06:56.380* :  released from Israeli jails, and then there would be a six week pausing hostilities in Gaza.
*06:56.380- 07:02.040* :  So we don't know whether major obstacles have been resolved, but Hamas says it is now analyzing
*07:02.040- 07:07.780* :  the situation. Our international editor Jeremy Bowen has been to Ben Gurion University of the
*07:07.780- 07:13.560* :  Negev, just 40 kilometers or so from Gaza, to get the views of three students who spent months
*07:13.560- 07:18.480* :  fighting in combat units in Gaza. They're just some of the tens of thousands of Israeli
*07:18.480- 07:22.980* :  reservists who are mobilized after the attacks by Hamas on the 7th of October.
*07:23.780- 07:29.080* :  My name is Oded Adler, and I've been now in Gaza for about four months,
*07:29.080- 07:34.980* :  and I'm studying here business management third year. My name is Elan, and the reserves I was mostly
*07:34.980- 07:40.560* :  in Gaza and all of the areas, the north, the center, the south. Nice study here physiotherapy second
*07:40.560- 07:47.740* :  year. Hi, my name is Ben. I'm a master's student here in BGU for physics. I am in the engineering
*07:47.740- 07:52.220* :  unit in the 98th division. So Ben, you're in Gaza to last Friday. What was it like? What
*07:52.220- 07:57.480* :  were you guys doing? Well, it was dangerous at times, but it doesn't really cross your head.
*07:57.880- 08:01.500* :  You're in your mission, you're in what you're doing, you're kind of tunnel visioned in.
*08:01.880- 08:06.000* :  The whole time that I was there, I would remember October 7th, I remember all my friends,
*08:06.100- 08:11.060* :  and some are still hostages. So I was thinking of him trying to remember like why we're there,
*08:11.400- 08:17.820* :  to make sure that it can never happen again. Do you all have friends who've been caught up in it?
*08:17.820- 08:23.480* :  Who became victims who were ended up as hostages? I think if you'll go around this campus and you'll
*08:23.480- 08:30.420* :  ask each one, does he know someone that's killed in the 7th of October that was kidnapped?
*08:30.420- 08:36.020* :  It's everywhere. It's personal. When you were in Gaza, did you see Palestinians civilians?
*08:36.020- 08:41.900* :  Yes. They've a lot of them, they've gone through hell. For sure. What do you think about this?
*08:42.180- 08:47.500* :  I mean, what did you think about that as a human being? I think war is terrible. And to see
*08:47.500- 08:53.820* :  civilians that are getting killed, evacuate from their homes because the army needs to get in,
*08:53.820- 08:59.740* :  it's not something that makes me happy to see. Every time we went to a new area in Gaza,
*08:59.740- 09:06.000* :  so the army went with airplanes and put a lot of papers that said the army is going to get in.
*09:06.420- 09:11.460* :  As a soldier, you think, wow, okay, now I'm telling the enemy, I'm coming to a new area.
*09:11.460- 09:17.580* :  That's not smart. But as a human being, I understand it's crucial. But I think and I hope,
*09:17.680- 09:25.200* :  and this is what we have here, hope that once Hamas will be finished, so also the Palestinians in Gaza
*09:25.200- 09:30.840* :  will have much better life. And you know what? A lot of the time, even the Palestinians told us
*09:31.160- 09:34.160* :  that it's good that Hamas won't be there anymore.
*09:34.360- 09:39.980* :  Elon, a lot of people around the world had massive sympathy with Israel on the 7th of October.
*09:40.380- 09:44.260* :  And of course, they still sympathize with what's happened. But then they look at what's happened
*09:44.260- 09:49.300* :  ever since. Even the Americans are saying, you're not fighting the right way. You're killing too
*09:49.300- 09:54.320* :  many civilians. You're breaking too much infrastructure. I mean, what would your response be to that?
*09:55.040- 10:00.200* :  In this case, Hamas, it's more than a terror group. It's kind of an army. And they fight a different
*10:00.200- 10:06.000* :  kind of tactic. Like they hide behind civilians. They sit inside their tunnels. They go out for
*10:06.000- 10:11.280* :  like 10 seconds, shoot, go back. And then I think it's really hard to tell us how to fight it.
*10:11.560- 10:17.140* :  Ben, what's your view on that? We were under like sniper fire and a unit nearby us,
*10:17.580- 10:21.800* :  knew how to help us, but they couldn't do it yet because we had suspicion that there were
*10:22.200- 10:26.660* :  civilians there. Like how can you say that we're not doing enough to save gas and civilians when I'm
*10:26.660- 10:31.280* :  practically putting my life on the line for this? For the same people that just several months ago
*10:31.280- 10:36.400* :  tried to slaughter my friends and my families. Joe Biden says this has got to lead to a Palestinian
*10:36.400- 10:43.320* :  state. That is the recipe for peace. You agree with that? I think that if you'd have asked me this
*10:43.320- 10:49.580* :  question on October 6th, then I would say definitely yes. But after October 7th, it seems clear to me
*10:49.580- 10:57.560* :  that they don't want it as much as I wanted it. Some people say that going in like this does not
*10:57.560- 11:04.260* :  actually make Israel safer, longer term, because all those young boys who watching all of this
*11:04.760- 11:09.480* :  will when they get to the beef 17 or 18, they want to pick up a gun and maybe kill him Israeli and
*11:09.480- 11:13.280* :  get some revenge. Do you think it might radicalize people? Do you think that's a danger?
*11:14.100- 11:19.140* :  I think you could ask Gazzan's the same question. Like we've been radicalized. It's a two-way street
*11:19.140- 11:27.220* :  sort of, I mean it feels kind of is a responsibility to not radicalize Gazzan's, but where is Gazzan's
*11:27.780- 11:32.620* :  responsibility towards us? If we ever want to coexist, if we want a two-state solution,
*11:33.360- 11:38.040* :  we need responsibility on both sides. I was Odell Elan and Ben with our international editor,
*11:38.280- 11:43.160* :  Jeremy Bowen. Meanwhile, there have been more international moves towards recognizing a Palestinian
*11:43.160- 11:48.540* :  state. The Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, speaking to Parliament, has said Spain, along
*11:48.540- 11:53.520* :  with three other EU countries, is ready to declare such a recognition, calling it a step towards
*11:53.520- 11:58.960* :  resolving the conflict in the Middle East, but he gave no date. Separately, Australia's foreign
*11:58.960- 12:03.760* :  minister Penny Wong has said peace and stability will come to Israel only through international
*12:04.420- 12:09.620* :  recognition of a Palestinian state. Now let's say it's the taking part that counts, but the winners
*12:09.620- 12:14.500* :  of athletics events at this year's Olympics won't just be taking home a gold medal. World
*12:14.500- 12:19.360* :  athletics has announced it'll become the first international federation to award prize money
*12:19.360- 12:24.640* :  at an Olympics, starting in Paris this summer. A good idea, according to former Olympic athlete
*12:24.640- 12:30.740* :  and 1,500 metres silver medalist Steve Kram. Your world athletics receives money from the
*12:30.740- 12:36.020* :  IOC. As do all of the federations from the profits, if you like, from the games. And that money
*12:36.020- 12:39.880* :  over the years certainly back in my day, I had no idea where that money went. Why shouldn't it
*12:39.880- 12:43.640* :  percentage come back to the athletes, so I don't really have a problem with it? A correspondent
*12:43.640- 12:49.280* :  Matt Graveling told me more about the decision. This is across athletics, so I think track and
*12:49.280- 12:53.240* :  field, I mean everyone's kind of highlight of the games really is the 100 metre final, isn't it?
*12:53.240- 12:57.580* :  This would fall into that, but it's also things like the java in the discus. And world athletics
*12:57.580- 13:01.360* :  who are the governing body that look after all of track and field, not just at the Olympics,
*13:01.360- 13:08.060* :  but across all events, they've ringfenced $2.4 million. Now this is money that they get from the
*13:08.060- 13:12.380* :  international Olympics committee, and they in turn get their money from broadcaster revenue.
*13:12.380- 13:16.780* :  So it trickles down through the federations and world athletics said, right, we're going to give
*13:16.780- 13:21.400* :  a little bit more of this money that we get back to the athletes. It's the first time that they
*13:21.400- 13:26.980* :  financially incentivise the winning of a gold medal. So in Paris, which is just 107 days away,
*13:26.980- 13:33.660* :  if you do win a gold medal in athletics, you will get that $50,000. And that is also going to be
*13:33.660- 13:39.860* :  extended with a commitment from world athletics to Los Angeles in 2028, where they say they're also
*13:39.860- 13:44.200* :  going to reward the silver and the bronze place medalist, although they haven't given us an
*13:44.200- 13:50.440* :  idea on amounts for that yet. If you're serious about track and field events, then the idea of
*13:50.440- 13:55.500* :  representing your country at the Olympics is the pinnacle of what you can achieve. Why do you also
*13:55.500- 14:01.280* :  need some cash? I think that's right. And I was lucky enough to be on a meeting this morning with
*14:01.280- 14:05.320* :  Lord Coe who's, of course, the president of world athletics and a two-time gold medalist,
*14:05.700- 14:10.720* :  himself and during the 80s, he won gold twice in the two consecutive games in the 1500. If he'd
*14:10.720- 14:15.440* :  been competing for this kind of money, he would have walked away with $100,000. But I think it's
*14:15.440- 14:21.740* :  important to say that for most athletes, Lord Coe says that will be enough. It will be the pinnacle
*14:21.740- 14:26.740* :  of their success. He doesn't believe this financial incentive will ruin the spirit of the games.
*14:26.780- 14:31.840* :  However, a lot of athletes are getting a lot of money through sponsorship. If you look at you
*14:31.840- 14:35.600* :  saying, but he won eight gold medals at the Olympics, two of them were in the relay. That prize
*14:35.600- 14:40.860* :  money would be split between all four people. But he would have effectively got $350,000. Now,
*14:40.860- 14:45.860* :  does he need that with all the endorsements that he had? Possibly not over that whole career.
*14:45.860- 14:50.740* :  But if you look at people like Javelin Throwers and Discus and Shotput, the money for those
*14:50.740- 14:56.080* :  kind of athletes who a lot do have to sell funds could be invaluable. And this is going to put a
*14:56.080- 15:01.080* :  lot of pressure on the governing bodies of other Olympic sports to follow suit to the same thing.
*15:01.200- 15:06.120* :  That also came up in the meeting with Lord Coe earlier. You've gone first on this. And while
*15:06.120- 15:12.240* :  money back to the athletes can't be seen as a bad thing, is it going to look bad on other
*15:12.240- 15:18.580* :  federations who now aren't paying their athletes a similar money? And Lord Coe says that we can
*15:18.580- 15:23.460* :  only do what we can do. We feel this is right. We want to financially reward the athletes who
*15:23.600- 15:27.460* :  effectively are the reason why the broadcast money comes in anyway because they're the stars of
*15:28.420- 15:33.380* :  our correspondent Matt Graveling Boeing is in trouble again. It's already under investigation
*15:33.380- 15:40.080* :  after an exit door broke off one of its 787 MAX 9 planes in January, prompting the chief executive
*15:40.080- 15:45.940* :  David Calhoun to announce his resignation on Monday an engine cover broke off during a flight.
*15:45.980- 15:52.060* :  Now an engineer has accused the company of taking shortcuts during the construction of its 787 and
*15:52.060- 15:58.780* :  777 planes. The claims by Sam Salapore sparked an investigation by the U.S. Federal Aviation
*15:58.780- 16:04.680* :  Authority. That and the fact that Boeing only delivered 83 planes in the first quarter of 2024
*16:04.680- 16:11.340* :  put the markets in a spin, wiping almost 2% off the company's share price. Boeing dismissed the
*16:11.340- 16:16.560* :  allegations as inaccurate, saying it was confident its planes were safe. It's our business correspondent
*16:16.560- 16:21.760* :  Aaron Delmal. A former Boeing employee accused the company of cutting corners and
*16:21.760- 16:27.420* :  overlooking engineering problems during production of the 787 Dreamliner that he said could weaken
*16:27.420- 16:33.180* :  the plane's structural integrity. Boeing dismissed the claims as inaccurate and reiterated confidence
*16:33.180- 16:38.740* :  in the model. Now the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the whistleblower's accusations
*16:38.740- 16:44.120* :  and Congress plans to question him this month. Meanwhile, the company delivered its lowest
*16:44.120- 16:50.760* :  number of planes in the first quarter of the year since 2021, just 83 planes down from 157 the
*16:50.760- 16:56.000* :  quarter prior. Boeing executives say the company is slowing down production so that it can improve
*16:56.000- 17:01.540* :  quality control. The U.S.'s top aviation watchdog is enforcing that process. But delivery
*17:01.540- 17:05.960* :  delays are sparking criticism from customers who have little choice to fulfill their needs.
*17:05.980- 17:11.800* :  Boeing and Airbus dominate the U.S. market. The company shares dropped Tuesday to their lowest
*17:11.800- 17:19.980* :  in five months. Aaron Delmal reporting. And still to come. We're in the year 2024.
*17:20.140- 17:25.560* :  This is going back in time to a time when people didn't have bodily autonomy.
*17:25.560- 17:28.780* :  We hear from the head of the biggest abortion clinic in Arizona,
*17:29.400- 17:33.240* :  after the U.S. State Supreme Court ruled in favor of an abortion ban.
*17:41.800- 17:45.920* :  Normally, being a little extra might be a bit much, but not when it comes to healthcare.
*17:46.180- 17:49.680* :  That's why UnitedHealthCare's Health Protector Guard fixed indemnity insurance plans
*17:49.680- 17:53.020* :  underwritten by Golden Rule Insurance Company supplement your primary plan,
*17:53.020- 17:56.600* :  so you manage out-of-pocket costs. Learn more at UH1.com.

*18:14.380- 18:18.480* :  Tightly controlled. It's not so healthy to be a journalist there.

*18:33.060- 18:35.400* :  Now there's no love loss between China and Taiwan.
*18:35.400- 18:40.480* :  For decade, China has insisted the self-raud island of Taiwan is a breakaway province.
*18:40.480- 18:45.740* :  A President Xi Jinping has made no secret that he wants to eventually take it back under Beijing's
*18:45.740- 18:50.780* :  control. So the fact that President Xi has held talks with Taiwan's former President,
*18:50.780- 18:54.160* :  Ma Yingzhou, is significant and he sounded positive.
*18:57.960- 19:01.240* :  compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are Chinese.
*19:01.260- 19:03.780* :  There is no ranker that cannot be resolved.
*19:03.920- 19:06.080* :  There are no issues that cannot be discussed.
*19:06.780- 19:08.280* :  No force can separate us.
*19:08.820- 19:11.680* :  Differences in our systems cannot change the objective fact
*19:11.680- 19:16.020* :  that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to the same nation, the same ethnicity.
*19:16.680- 19:20.340* :  Foreign interference cannot stop the historic event of a family reunion.
*19:22.380- 19:25.980* :  To find out more about the meeting, I spoke to our Asia Pacific Regional Editor,
*19:26.220- 19:26.920* :  Celia Hatton.
*19:27.420- 19:31.200* :  Normally, I'm through. We wouldn't really bother spending time talking about a meeting
*19:31.200- 19:36.720* :  between China's current leader and a former leader, Ma Yingzhou, who was
*19:37.100- 19:42.900* :  Taiwan's president. He was voted out of office in 2016, so he doesn't really have
*19:43.320- 19:50.480* :  much political power now, but this meeting was treated by the leaders in Beijing,
*19:50.480- 19:54.240* :  as if it was quite important. If you look at the video of it, it's in quite an ornate
*19:54.560- 19:59.300* :  state room, as we just heard, Xi Jinping said, very, very warm things.
*19:59.300- 20:05.660* :  And it was almost like China was trying to show the people of Taiwan an alternate reality,
*20:05.660- 20:11.540* :  the future they could choose if only they agreed that Taiwan was part of China.
*20:11.960- 20:16.980* :  And they went back in time to the years that Ma Yingzhou was actually in power,
*20:16.980- 20:22.120* :  when he had much, much closer ties with China, when there were direct flights between the two,
*20:22.120- 20:27.080* :  when there was a lot of trade between the two. And so it was almost like China was trying to
*20:27.080- 20:33.060* :  remind people in Taiwan what they could have if only they accepted Xi Jinping's conditions.
*20:33.460- 20:38.740* :  Meanwhile, the newly elected president's about to be sworn in and couldn't have a more different
*20:38.740- 20:44.520* :  approach. That's right. So the newly elected president is William Lai from the DPP. That's the
*20:44.520- 20:50.440* :  arch rival to Ma Yingzhou's party, the KMT. And William Lai has a much different approach.
*20:50.440- 20:55.260* :  He has said that he's open to dialogue with China, something the Chinese leaders have
*20:55.580- 21:02.440* :  never wanted to endorse. But he says that really he's a defender of democracy. He says that he
*21:02.440- 21:07.340* :  doesn't need Taiwan to ever actually declare independence because it already is independent,
*21:07.680- 21:12.500* :  he says. And so he's advocated a path that really takes Taiwan towards much, much closer
*21:12.500- 21:19.360* :  relationships with the United States and other Western allies like the EU. We have to put this
*21:19.360- 21:27.960* :  in context. This is all happening. This meeting in Beijing today while Beijing is putting a lot
*21:27.960- 21:33.640* :  of pressure on Taiwan militarily. We're seeing a lot of Chinese planes and ships going near Taiwan
*21:33.660- 21:40.000* :  almost every day and diplomatically Taiwan's being isolated. You know, there's only 11 countries
*21:40.000- 21:46.120* :  and the Vatican now formally recognize Taiwan as a political entity. Asia-Pacific editor,
*21:46.120- 21:52.520* :  Celia Hatton. In the previous podcast, we told you about Arizona, the 15th US state to bring in a
*21:52.520- 21:58.520* :  near total abortion ban since the nationwide right to a termination was removed two years ago.
*21:59.000- 22:04.180* :  That law is expected to come into effect in two weeks. We got reaction from the owner and director
*22:04.180- 22:09.260* :  of the Camelback family planning clinic in Arizona, Dr Gabriela Goodrick, who's been helping women
*22:09.260- 22:15.200* :  access abortion services for nearly three decades. She spoke to my colleague, Victoria O'Hunder.
*22:16.100- 22:25.360* :  My reaction has been shock, dismay, really discussed. I mean, the law is draconian,
*22:26.300- 22:34.180* :  it's cruel, it's, I mean, we're in the year 2024. This is going back in time to a time when
*22:34.860- 22:40.580* :  people didn't have bodily autonomy. So who's going to be most at risk with this slow?
*22:42.100- 22:50.780* :  This law, if it succeeds in becoming a truly law, will ban abortion except for the life of
*22:51.540- 23:00.280* :  the person who's pregnant. So it's very extreme. There's no exceptions for rape or incest or
*23:01.280- 23:07.940* :  fatal fetal abnormalities. It doesn't take into account any suffering on the part of the
*23:07.980- 23:15.300* :  woman with medical conditions. It affects many people. People that don't think it will affect them.
*23:15.700- 23:20.160* :  People that have wanted pregnancies who develop complications, who can't get the care they need
*23:20.160- 23:27.220* :  in the state they live and have to travel. But of course, these bands affect marginalized populations
*23:27.220- 23:36.600* :  the most. Black and brown women, Latina women, poor world women, young people, it affects them the
*23:36.600- 23:42.280* :  most because they won't have the resources to travel to get the care that they need.
*23:43.660- 23:51.400* :  For many years, you've been working at clinics and helping women have access to abortion services.
*23:51.400- 23:57.420* :  I wonder what are some of the cases that you've come across of women who've come to you or the
*23:57.420- 24:06.180* :  women that you've worked with? Every patient I see has a compelling reason to end their pregnancy.
*24:07.380- 24:15.740* :  Every single patient, most people have multiple reasons for seeking this care. One out of four women
*24:15.740- 24:22.740* :  will have an abortion in their lifetime. This is not an uncommon experience. Pregnancy complications
*24:22.740- 24:31.900* :  happen and abortion care will always be needed and women come, like I said, many reasons. Abusive
*24:31.900- 24:37.960* :  relationships, they're not emotionally, physically or financially ready to add a child to their
*24:37.960- 24:46.640* :  family or become a parent. They are ill. They are 50 years old. They are 12 years old. They have
*24:46.640- 24:52.740* :  been sexually assaulted. They have cancer. What else? I mean, I could go on and on. You know,
*24:53.560- 24:59.680* :  it's a personal decision that a person has to make with their family and their doctor.
*25:00.940- 25:05.700* :  So what's going to happen then to clinics in Arizona that offer abortion services?
*25:07.220- 25:14.660* :  I think that we will survive because this extreme law will push
*25:15.600- 25:24.900* :  Arizona's to vote and to vote pro-choice, to support a referendum that is going to be on the
*25:24.900- 25:32.380* :  ballot in November that will put it in our constitution that all people of Arizona have
*25:33.340- 25:41.520* :  reproductive freedom and bodily autonomy. And this will swing the other way. And we will have
*25:41.520- 25:49.120* :  abortion in Arizona as a part of healthcare that people need here, just like they need all
*25:49.120- 25:55.200* :  over the world. Dr. Gabriella Goodrick in Arizona. Votes are being counted in South Korea's
*25:55.200- 25:59.900* :  election. It looks like opposition parties may have increased their majority. And if the exit
*25:59.900- 26:04.400* :  polls are right, that will be a setback for the South Korean president. A correspondent in
*26:04.400- 26:09.920* :  Seoul is Jean McKenzie. The first thing to note is that exit polls in Korea are unreliable.
*26:09.920- 26:14.660* :  They have been wrong in the past and they don't take account of the early voting that's been
*26:14.660- 26:18.120* :  happening here over the past week. And so we don't want to read too much into them.
*26:18.580- 26:23.400* :  If they are correct though, it means that the liberal opposition party is on course to win a
*26:23.400- 26:28.300* :  significant majority in the parliament. These elections, although just parliamentary elections,
*26:28.300- 26:33.180* :  they don't decide the president. They are being seen as a midterm referendum on the current
*26:33.180- 26:38.440* :  president Yoon Sung-yeol, who's been in office for two years now. Now he has been on popular
*26:38.440- 26:44.440* :  from the start, but neither side expected him to be punished this much. If his party does lose
*26:44.440- 26:49.540* :  in a big way, it will weaken his authority and make it nearly impossible for him to be able to
*26:49.540- 26:55.320* :  push ahead with his agenda and pass legislation. The big number that everybody is interested in
*26:55.320- 27:00.700* :  is 200. This is what's needed to get what's called a super majority here. And it means that if the
*27:00.700- 27:06.520* :  opposition party and the smaller parties get 200 seats or more between them, they can join forces
*27:06.520- 27:10.720* :  to push through laws that the government doesn't want. The president will no longer be able to
*27:10.720- 27:16.160* :  use his veto. And that could make politics here pretty chaotic. But we will have to wait until the
*27:16.160- 27:21.020* :  morning here in Korea to find out the results for real and what they mean. But they could have
*27:21.080- 27:24.540* :  big implications for how this country's run over the next three years.
*27:24.720- 27:30.620* :  Jim McKenzie in Seoul. If learning a language was easy, we'd all be multilingual, I guess. Of course,
*27:30.620- 27:35.820* :  it's not that straightforward, but now thanks to AI conversing in a different language.
*27:35.820- 27:42.020* :  It's something anyone can do. James Clayton reports. Unfortunately, I can't speak any other
*27:42.020- 27:56.740* :  languages fluently other than English. Now, what's the most possible thing to say if I could speak
*28:00.460- 28:05.020* :  Polish. Thanks to new AI apps, though, I can give at least the impression of being able to speak
*28:05.020- 28:12.500* :  pretty much any language. This one is called Hagen. So I'm going to speak like this. I do a quick
*28:12.500- 28:19.700* :  video of myself upload it onto Hagen and Wait. And then out pops a video of me speaking the language
*28:19.700- 28:32.100* :  that I chose in this case Spanish. Here's the really cool bit. When Omar, the producer on this
*28:32.100- 28:37.740* :  piece, got into the shot, it detected his voice was different to mine and translated his voice to.
*28:42.260- 28:47.020* :  I've actually managed to fool some friends using this. It really is impressive.
*28:48.400- 28:53.640* :  In London, one company called Synthesia is using this kind of text to translate AI-generated
*28:53.640- 28:59.180* :  corporate videos into any language. Many of these companies, of course, have divisions all over
*28:59.180- 29:05.440* :  the world. It's a Salesforce, maybe, that they need to train with this tool that can create the
*29:05.440- 29:09.880* :  base material in English, they can then translate it into different localities. But the company's
*29:09.880- 29:15.140* :  founder says the tech has other benefits too. And we've seen that with NGOs all over the world where
*29:15.140- 29:20.260* :  they can produce video content, instead of written content, for people who may have a difficult
*29:20.260- 29:24.280* :  time reading and do it in local languages. So in just this kind of dissemination of information
*29:24.280- 29:31.020* :  in people's native language, my video on audio, is very, very powerful. As it gets easier and easier
*29:31.020- 29:36.040* :  to change the words that come out of our mouths, there's also a worry that this kind of technology
*29:36.040- 29:42.400* :  could increase the amount of misinformation on the internet. But when it comes to translating
*29:42.400- 29:47.420* :  educational videos or sending a message to someone in their own language, there's a clear
*29:47.420- 29:51.320* :  advantage. It's not just about trying to impress friends.
*29:52.100- 29:56.840* :  James Clayton telling us with a little help from AI in German that there's more to this technology
*29:56.840- 30:01.820* :  than just impressing your friends. Now before we go, is there anything you want to get off your
*30:01.820- 30:07.700* :  chest? A study from Nagoya University in Japan reveals the best way of managing anger might be to
*30:07.700- 30:11.980* :  scribble down your thoughts and then throw them away. Jacob Perkins has more.
*30:12.680- 30:16.180* :  You might think that keeping your thoughts locked away is a good way to deal with them,
*30:16.480- 30:20.660* :  but the act of writing them down scrunch them up and putting them in the bin could change your
*30:24.240- 30:27.580* :  perspective. That's according to a study where researchers asked participants to write down
*30:27.580- 30:32.360* :  opinions about social issues and were told that someone would evaluate their writing. But there
*30:32.360- 30:36.300* :  wasn't really an evaluation and they were given low scores on things like their intelligence
*30:36.300- 30:40.720* :  and their logic. The participants then had to write down their reaction to the comments
*30:40.720- 30:45.640* :  and focus on what triggered their emotions. Half were told to scrunch at their paper and throw
*30:45.640- 30:50.340* :  in the bin or put it in a shredder. The others were told to put it in a box or keep it in a file
*30:50.820- 30:54.940* :  or were highly angry after being insulted, but the anger levels dropped for individuals who got
*30:54.940- 30:59.680* :  rid of their paper. The lead researcher Noah Yuki Kawai said he expected it would suppress
*30:59.680- 31:04.300* :  anger to some extent, but it was actually eliminated almost entirely. He said for method
*31:04.300- 31:08.400* :  echoes a centuries old Japanese tradition where angry feelings are set down in writing,
*31:08.400- 31:13.660* :  sealed in a small vessel and then destroyed. And he says it's important for businesses too.
*31:13.920- 31:18.620* :  I'm going to sometimes destroy the human relationship for friendship or
*31:18.620- 31:26.720* :  capital or even in companies. I think we can give our method to keep our relationship there.
*31:27.200- 31:31.080* :  So next time you want to shout at someone, maybe just write down your thoughts and give this method
*31:31.080- 31:37.920* :  a go. Jacob Perkins reporting. And that's all from us for now. There will be a new edition of
