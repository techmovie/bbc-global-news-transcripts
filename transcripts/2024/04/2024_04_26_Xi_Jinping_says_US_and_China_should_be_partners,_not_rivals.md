*01:24.100- 01:29.580* :  I'm Andrew Patron at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 26th of April. These are our main stories.
*01:30.200- 01:35.060* :  The US Secretary of State meets President Xi in Beijing and raises concerns about Chinese
*01:35.060- 01:40.980* :  support for Russia. China's the top supplier of machine tools, microelectronics, nitrocellulose,
*01:40.980- 01:45.280* :  which is critical to making munitions. Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine
*01:45.280- 01:51.180* :  without China's support. The US military starts building a floating pier to get aid into Gaza,
*01:51.780- 01:55.780* :  and the first personalized vaccine to defend against melanoma skin cancer.
*01:58.300- 02:03.180* :  Also in this podcast, you've heard about blood diamonds. Now lawyers challenge Apple over
*02:03.180- 02:09.060* :  its alleged use of blood metals. Haitians wake up to a new political reality, but how much hope
*02:09.060- 02:15.200* :  does it really hold? Ant? Twain turned around because she wanted to and was interested and
*02:15.200- 02:20.040* :  looks like curiosity and communication and intelligence go together.
*02:20.400- 02:25.860* :  Now talking to Twain the humpback whale could help us communicate with aliens from out of space.
*02:29.300- 02:34.880* :  It was a chance for China and the US to stabilize relations with the American Secretary of State
*02:34.880- 02:40.340* :  Anthony Blinken having concluded the official part of his visit to China. It seems things are on a
*02:40.340- 02:45.640* :  more even keel. After his meeting with Mr Blinken, the Chinese President Xi Jinping said the two
*02:45.640- 02:53.660* :  economic superpowers had no choice but to work together. The two countries should be partners,
*02:53.660- 03:00.860* :  not rivals. They should achieve mutual success, not harm each other. They should see common ground.
*03:00.860- 03:06.460* :  Instead of vicious competition, they should be true to their words and be resolute in their
*03:06.460- 03:12.440* :  actions, rather than saying one thing and doing another. But Mr Blinken's meetings with Chinese
*03:12.440- 03:17.260* :  leaders also brought the tensions between the two to the surface. Mr Blinken addressed several
*03:17.260- 03:21.780* :  of those areas of disagreement, including Chinese support for Russia's war against Ukraine.
*03:39.400- 03:45.020* :  China's the top supplier of machine tools, microelectronics, nitrocellulose, which is critical to
*03:45.020- 03:50.520* :  making munitions and rocket propellants. Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine
*03:51.400- 03:56.180* :  without China's support. Our correspondent in Beijing, Steven McDonald gave us his assessment
*03:56.180- 04:00.520* :  of what Mr Blinken had to say. Perhaps I should start with the most contentious thing,
*04:00.520- 04:08.260* :  I think he said, which was yet some very strong words regarding what the US says is China's
*04:08.260- 04:15.420* :  backing for Russia in its war in Ukraine. The way he says China's doing this is that it's supplying
*04:15.420- 04:22.400* :  machine tools and other dual use items, which could be used in weapons or to be used in the
*04:22.400- 04:28.420* :  machinery, which makes weapons. Now he's called on Beijing to rein in these companies that are
*04:28.420- 04:33.440* :  providing this stuff to Russia. But he said, if China doesn't address this, we will.
*04:33.900- 04:38.980* :  Now he didn't explain how the US would address this, but I can only imagine it's something like
*04:38.980- 04:43.680* :  sanctions on the Chinese companies supplying this stuff to Russia. He said that in the past,
*04:43.680- 04:50.240* :  China had exerted influence on Russia, for example, in discouraging Russia from using nuclear
*04:50.240- 04:54.880* :  weapons in Ukraine. Praise China for doing this. So he said, you know, you've done this before.
*04:54.940- 05:00.840* :  So maybe it's time for an action like this again. So some kind of a sort of stern warning,
*05:00.840- 05:05.960* :  if you like, and maybe now Washington's going to wait and see if China does deliver on this.
*05:06.260- 05:12.360* :  So interesting. I mean, lots and lots of diplomatic language. We want to do these sharp
*05:12.360- 05:17.540* :  jabs in amongst it all from Anthony Blinken. What do you think the Chinese will make of that? He's
*05:17.540- 05:22.920* :  staying there in Beijing giving a news conference with these harsh messages, but also saying he wants
*05:22.920- 05:28.160* :  more cooperation. Well, funnily enough, that's their message too, though. So the readout we've
*05:28.160- 05:34.860* :  seen from the Chinese side in these meetings is quite similar, harsh words for the US supplying
*05:34.860- 05:40.520* :  weapons to Taiwan. Beijing would say that's inflaming tensions across the Taiwan strait,
*05:40.800- 05:46.240* :  and yet praise for these other areas where they can cooperate with one another. I mean, I think what
*05:46.780- 05:53.240* :  is remarkable is that despite all these tensions, the atmosphere, if I could put it that way in
*05:53.240- 05:57.120* :  Beijing, I'll keep you spoke to taxi drivers and say, what do you think of the Blinken visit and
*05:57.120- 06:02.620* :  what have you? It's not animosity towards the US government, and I think people would welcome
*06:02.620- 06:08.600* :  the talks because both sides have said they need to explain very clearly where their points of
*06:08.600- 06:13.360* :  disagreement are, because otherwise it could be quite deadly. And in the words of Wang Yi,
*06:13.360- 06:18.780* :  Anthony Blinken's opposite number, they can either cooperate with one another, or they can let the
*06:18.780- 06:24.040* :  relationship collapse and drift towards conflict. And what is referring to there is the danger of
*06:24.100- 06:29.420* :  say in the South China Sea or around Taiwan, a battle or a war breaking out between the world
*06:29.420- 06:36.160* :  superpowers that they don't want to actually fall into, and some small misunderstanding could lead to
*06:36.600- 06:41.620* :  a much bigger military conflict. And so this is why, for example, they've renewed military
*06:41.620- 06:47.780* :  to military communications. Steve McDonald with me from Beijing. A revolutionary new vaccine is
*06:47.780- 06:53.520* :  being trialled in the UK designed to target melanoma skin cancer. The treatment, which uses the same
*06:53.520- 06:59.640* :  mRNA technology as some COVID jabs, works by telling the body to hunt down cancer cells and prevent
*06:59.640- 07:04.460* :  them from returning. A health correspondent Michelle Roberts told me how it's tailored to the individual
*07:04.460- 07:09.540* :  patient. What they do is they take out the cancer from the patient, they take it to the lab, they
*07:09.540- 07:15.200* :  carefully look at it, and then they design this cancer vaccine for that specific cancer. And the
*07:15.200- 07:21.500* :  idea is to try and stop any leftover cancer cells that might still be lingering. So that's what they're
*07:21.500- 07:27.560* :  hoping to do. There's trials going on. It's a phase three trial, which is the one to see how well
*07:27.560- 07:33.440* :  it's actually working. And it's going on in a few different countries, including the UK. And one
*07:33.440- 07:40.140* :  of the first people in the UK to try it is Steve Young, who had a growth, a melanoma growth on his
*07:40.140- 07:45.800* :  scalp removed about a year ago. Okay, someone told me I've got survivors syndrome because I actually
*07:45.800- 07:52.380* :  feel guilty. I feel guilty that I'm completely fine. And yet I'm getting all this attention. And I'm,
*07:52.540- 07:58.220* :  you know, I get to have a scan and an MRI every three months when I know that people are waiting
*07:59.060- 08:06.120* :  such a long time. And I genuinely feel kind of awful about that. But I just really hope that
*08:07.500- 08:13.500* :  what's happening with the trial and the results they get are going to be good news. And it's going
*08:13.500- 08:19.400* :  to go on to do amazing things. He's one of the patients on the trial. Other countries, including
*08:19.400- 08:25.380* :  Australia and the US are also recruiting people to try it. Only some of the patients will get the
*08:25.380- 08:30.840* :  real cancer vaccine. Some will get a dummy shot. So they don't know which one they've got. But the
*08:30.840- 08:37.060* :  hope is that it will stamp out any remaining cancer cells, which would be a real game changer.
*08:37.460- 08:42.180* :  We saw in Covid times. That's how quickly this stuff can be developed when the pressure is on.
*08:42.580- 08:48.020* :  For people listening who are thinking, this treatment could help me. What sort of time
*08:48.020- 08:54.180* :  are we talking about on this? So this is a phase three trial, which is kind of the last step if
*08:54.180- 08:59.300* :  you like. They're looking to see how effective it is. So they've done earlier safety trials,
*08:59.300- 09:05.340* :  which look really good. And it will still take some time. That's the unfortunate thing. It takes
*09:05.340- 09:10.380* :  time to get all the patients to run the trial and then to number crunch the results at the end and
*09:10.380- 09:17.000* :  publish them. So we're talking years still. Although the technology, as you say, through the pandemic,
*09:17.160- 09:22.260* :  I mean, that was one of the really good payoffs was that science moved forward quite a lot.
*09:23.120- 09:28.960* :  And this is one of the fortunate outcomes that we've now got this mRNA technology that
*09:29.300- 09:33.460* :  looks like it can be really good for tackling cancer. And that's really important.
*09:33.480- 09:37.980* :  And could be presumably using a whole range of conditions, which are the beginning of the process
*09:37.980- 09:43.140* :  as I understand it, of exploring what mRNA tech could do. Yeah, so researchers are looking at other
*09:43.140- 09:48.020* :  cancers too. They're looking at kidney lung. And what it's doing is teaching the body how to use
*09:48.020- 09:52.740* :  its own immune system to fight the cancer cells. Health correspondent Michelle Roberts,
*09:53.400- 09:59.160* :  you probably heard of blood diamonds, precious gems mined in a war zone and then sold to finance
*09:59.160- 10:05.300* :  an insurgency and invading army's war efforts or terrorism. Today come allegations of a new type
*10:05.300- 10:11.380* :  of exploitation of conflict zones, blood metals. The government in the Democratic Republic of Congo
*10:11.380- 10:16.700* :  is accusing the tech giant Apple of using minerals illegally mined from the east of the country
*10:16.700- 10:22.060* :  an area that's suffered years of armed conflict. Lawyers for the DRC have written to Apple
*10:22.060- 10:27.380* :  warning of legal action if the alleged practice continues. The French lawyer William Bourdon is one
*10:27.380- 10:31.840* :  of those representing the Congolese government. He taught my colleague Victoria O'Hunder the logic
*10:31.840- 10:38.400* :  behind the letter. If Apple has done the right job and taken the good measures, they could not
*10:38.400- 10:45.160* :  have continued to exploit these minerals. All their strategy is to try to convince the consumers
*10:45.160- 10:51.080* :  on the world that they haven't dissipated on the risks that took the good measures and in good
*10:51.080- 10:57.660* :  face and they could not do more on best. In reality, they did not make the good job because if they
*10:57.660- 11:03.440* :  had made the good job, they would have been obliged to stop all exploitation of these blood minerals.
*11:03.760- 11:09.500* :  What are these blood minerals? Can you break them to us? You remember blood diamonds? We can duplicate
*11:10.060- 11:16.120* :  blood minerals. Blood minerals, it's a long story, it's a normal moon for all the civil society,
*11:16.120- 11:23.020* :  it's kind of black box. This part of the world where like a concert, militias, army groups,
*11:23.020- 11:28.320* :  since years and years have committed the war crimes. These are strategic minerals which were
*11:28.320- 11:35.140* :  needed by all the ITAC giants and they are exploded north of Congol in conditions
*11:35.180- 11:41.500* :  equivalent to the Commission of International Crime. Some of them of these minerals are transferred
*11:41.500- 11:47.620* :  by illegal avenues and it's very important to understand that this instruction which have been
*11:47.620- 11:54.300* :  given by DRC, why Apple, because Apple of course is a giant, because we were able to documentate
*11:54.300- 12:00.900* :  very precisely all the facts which is a background of politics and this is the first move of a
*12:01.060- 12:06.560* :  new policy of the DRC. We want to moralize the way in which the raw material is exposed to
*12:06.560- 12:11.720* :  in this country. Responding to the allegations, the tech giant Apple referred the BBC to statements
*12:11.720- 12:17.720* :  from its 2023 annual corporate report saying based on our due diligence efforts including
*12:17.720- 12:23.500* :  analyzing the information provided by third party audit programs, upstream traceability programs
*12:23.500- 12:28.760* :  and our suppliers, we found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or
*12:28.760- 12:36.140* :  refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly
*12:36.140- 12:43.280* :  financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an joining country. No, we won't sell TikTok
*12:43.280- 12:48.900* :  is the blunt answer from the Chinese tech company bite dance which owns the hugely popular short
*12:48.900- 12:54.340* :  video platform. This follows reports they'd intended to do just that in order to comply with the new
*12:54.340- 12:59.720* :  law in the US threatening to ban it there. Our business reporter Surajana Tawari has more.
*13:00.360- 13:05.880* :  This statement was in response to US media reports that bite dance is looking for scenarios
*13:05.880- 13:12.320* :  to sell TikTok without the powerful secret algorithm that recommends videos to its more than
*13:12.320- 13:18.800* :  1 billion users around the world. Posting on a Chinese social media platform it owns bite
*13:18.800- 13:26.600* :  dance said foreign media reports about bite dance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue bite dance
*13:26.600- 13:33.060* :  does not have any plans to sell TikTok. Now TikTok of course has been a political and diplomatic
*13:33.060- 13:39.960* :  hot potato for years. The US is concerned it would hand user data over to the Chinese government
*13:39.960- 13:47.560* :  although TikTok says it has not and will not share US user data with Beijing. Critics say the
*13:47.560- 13:54.900* :  algorithm is also a problem and its ability to influence Americans and the latest development being
*13:54.900- 14:02.380* :  this bill that US President Joe Biden signed into law this week calling for a sale or a nationwide
*14:02.380- 14:09.240* :  ban. TikTok plans to sue and could take the case all the way to the Supreme Court which could take
*14:09.240- 14:15.180* :  years but there are a lot of issues with a potential sale as well. Finding a buyer for such
*14:15.180- 14:20.620* :  valuable company would be a challenge and anyone with deep enough pockets like Facebook's parent
*14:20.620- 14:28.040* :  meta or Google would prompt competition concerns but also there is a gray area over that powerful
*14:28.040- 14:37.000* :  algorithm. Beijing says the technology is protected and would oppose any force sale of TikTok saying
*14:37.000- 14:41.880* :  it will take all necessary measures to protect Chinese companies.
*14:50.740- 14:54.560* :  No matter how young we are no matter how few people we could possibly be we're still going to
*14:54.560- 14:58.280* :  show up and do all that we can to the people in Gaza who don't have a voice right now.
*15:05.600- 15:11.200* :  There's no sign of an end to Israel's military operation in Gaza. Indeed there are continuing reports of
*15:11.200- 15:16.540* :  an imminent ground assault on the southern city of Raffa. Aid agencies say the civilian population
*15:16.540- 15:22.460* :  faces a dire situation but there is a glimmer of hope today the US military has started building a
*15:22.460- 15:26.980* :  floating pier off the coast of Gaza to boost the supply of humanitarian aid.
*15:27.540- 15:31.460* :  Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder gave more details at a news conference.
*15:32.140- 15:36.520* :  As an update for our humanitarian assistance support operations to establish the maritime
*15:36.520- 15:41.840* :  corridor off the coast of Gaza I can confirm that US military vessels to include the US
*15:41.840- 15:47.940* :  NS Benavides have begun to construct the initial stages of the temporary pier and causeway at sea
*15:48.500- 15:52.520* :  or where the significant interest in this important effort and will provide much more
*15:52.520- 15:57.100* :  information in the very near future as we work alongside the international community to rush
*15:57.100- 16:02.140* :  aid to the people of Gaza. Our diplomatic correspondent James Landale is in Jerusalem and
*16:02.140- 16:07.360* :  told me how it's going to work. The plan essentially involves everything beginning in Cyprus.
*16:07.480- 16:12.980* :  Aid will be delivered there to a big holding area in the port it will be sorted out it will be
*16:12.980- 16:19.060* :  checked by Israeli forces and it will be put on to very large commercial vessels that will take the
*16:19.060- 16:25.760* :  aid south a couple of hundred nautical miles to a large floating platform that is as you said the
*16:25.760- 16:29.860* :  Americans just said they are now in a position to start building that large floating platform.
*16:29.860- 16:35.640* :  The aid will then be taken off the ships onto that platform and put into trucks. Those trucks will
*16:35.640- 16:41.760* :  then be driven onto landing craft of varying sizes. Some of them can hold 15 trucks some of them
*16:41.760- 16:47.020* :  slightly smaller just five trucks. Those vessels those little landing craft will then shuffle the aid
*16:47.440- 16:53.820* :  onto a second floating platform a floating causeway that will be several hundred meters long this
*16:53.820- 16:58.600* :  will be attached to the shore anchored in the sand and those trucks will then drive along the
*16:58.600- 17:04.760* :  causeway and then up onto the beach into a secure zone there deliver the aid to that secure zone
*17:04.760- 17:08.420* :  and then turn straight back and head back out to the floating platform.
*17:08.800- 17:14.420* :  Right so this gets more aid in but actually when this was first suggested the general
*17:14.420- 17:19.260* :  sense from other countries was well why don't you just allow more aid in by a road because that
*17:19.260- 17:23.460* :  would be more effective. Yeah and this whole idea initially was floated as a way of putting
*17:23.460- 17:30.660* :  pressure on the Israelis to open up more land aid routes. They have subsequently done that not
*17:30.660- 17:36.340* :  as much as governments and aid agencies want but things have improved a bit but this maritime
*17:36.340- 17:42.820* :  route is only one part of the delivery route. If you're talking about need involving you know
*17:42.820- 17:49.760* :  least 500 trucks a day the Americans are saying this particular maritime route at its best will be
*17:49.760- 17:56.000* :  150 trucks a day so it's part of the solution not the whole solution. James Landel in Jerusalem
*17:56.680- 18:00.700* :  with feelings running high about the situation in the Middle East student protests have been
*18:00.700- 18:06.040* :  happening at more and more university campuses in the United States. At Columbia University in New
*18:06.040- 18:11.960* :  York campus authorities and students are locked in stalemate over the removal of a tent encampment
*18:11.960- 18:17.940* :  protests and encampments have also been organized at universities in Boston Atlanta and at Princeton
*18:17.940- 18:24.100* :  New Jersey. Yasmin is a student at the University of Texas. I'm here to support my fellow Palestinians
*18:24.100- 18:28.760* :  and all the students who came out yesterday faculty as well all the people who got arrested I think
*18:28.760- 18:32.900* :  they need to know that they have a community that loves them and that's here for them. I think by
*18:32.900- 18:37.960* :  coming out protesting peaceful here it shows that there's a big amount of people who do care
*18:37.960- 18:41.780* :  about this it's not something that we're going to just let slide no matter how young we are no
*18:41.780- 18:46.200* :  matter how few people we could possibly be we're still going to show up and do all that we can
*18:46.200- 18:50.740* :  to the people in Gaza who don't have a voice right now. On North America editor Sarah Smith has
*18:50.740- 18:58.040* :  been to Columbia. What happens is every time the police are brought on to campus several more
*18:58.040- 19:06.440* :  protests strike up in what now feels like a nationwide movement is getting real momentum behind it.
*19:06.800- 19:11.680* :  We are reaching the end of term but certainly the ones I spoke today said that you know that was
*19:11.680- 19:17.480* :  not going to stop them from maintaining their protests and this tented encampment that they've
*19:17.480- 19:22.900* :  set up there. It does mean possibly the focus of this will shift to graduation ceremonies.
*19:23.580- 19:27.680* :  We've seen the University of Southern California just announced that they're massively scaling
*19:27.680- 19:31.920* :  back their graduation ceremony because they're worried about it being disrupted by protests
*19:32.640- 19:37.140* :  and I think you could see that happening at campuses across America and through the summer.
*19:37.500- 19:43.400* :  I met a number of Jewish students as well who've set up their own little corner of the campus
*19:43.400- 19:47.980* :  in Columbia University where they've cellotaped onto the wall photographs of all the Israeli
*19:47.980- 19:55.020* :  hostages currently being held by Hamas and signs demanding to release them now and they told me that
*19:55.020- 20:01.600* :  they felt intimidated and harassed by the fact of these protests being on their campus and then
*20:01.600- 20:08.840* :  having to walk past them. I have felt extremely physically unsafe, very distracted from my schoolwork,
*20:09.380- 20:17.420* :  very worried for all my other fellow Jewish students that look more Jewish than I do because
*20:17.420- 20:22.840* :  there have been a lot of emotional and physical assaults to them based on the way that they look
*20:23.620- 20:27.580* :  and it has just been extremely disappointed to walk into school and place where I
*20:28.340- 20:34.880* :  deserve to be here and to learn and feel like my voice and maybe my story and the way that I feel
*20:34.880- 20:40.120* :  about what's going on doesn't really matter. There have been incidents of anti-Semitic
*20:40.120- 20:45.840* :  behavior at a lot of the protests but the protesters will all tell you that these are limited in
*20:45.840- 20:51.060* :  number and that they crack down on it whenever possible and I met several Jewish students who were
*20:51.060- 20:56.740* :  actually part of the pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University who say they don't think there's
*20:56.740- 21:00.540* :  anything anti-Semitic about what's going on there and that their presence as part of that
*21:00.920- 21:06.980* :  encampment ought to be proof of that so there are feelings running incredibly high on all
*21:06.980- 21:12.220* :  sides and what was obvious being there was that this is completely dominating campus life.
*21:12.340- 21:18.360* :  Unorth America editor Sarah Smith Haitians woke on Friday to a new political reality following
*21:18.360- 21:23.120* :  the creation of a new transitional council that's meant to steer the troubled country towards
*21:23.120- 21:28.600* :  calmer waters and fresh elections. All this after Prime Minister Ariel Henri resigned in the face
*21:28.600- 21:33.500* :  of implacable hostility from among others the gangs that now control most of the capital
*21:33.500- 21:37.340* :  port of Prince. This resident of the city told us of her hopes and fears.
*21:37.980- 21:44.880* :  Lots of Haitians are not very hopeful that this will turn our current situation around.
*21:45.740- 21:54.440* :  We still in our hearts have faith that hopefully the people of the seven members now that they will
*21:54.440- 22:03.800* :  at least create a safe environment for us to be able to go to work for our kids to be able to go
*22:03.800- 22:12.960* :  to school and for us to continue living in peace and without the worries and the trauma that we
*22:12.960- 22:18.780* :  live on a regular basis. Matthias Pierre is a former minister for elections. He gave us his thoughts
*22:18.780- 22:25.520* :  on the challenges facing Haiti's new rulers. This is not the ideal solution. It's going to be a very
*22:25.520- 22:32.880* :  challenging situation but at the same time it's a beacon of hope. We hope that these people from
*22:32.880- 22:41.860* :  different groups will find the necessary consensus to address the big challenge that here is facing
*22:42.120- 22:50.500* :  at the moment. The big test the members has to sit together and pick among themselves one president
*22:51.520- 23:00.460* :  after the pick who's going to be the president. They have to agree on one Prime Minister who's
*23:00.460- 23:10.380* :  going to really leading the country and the government. The next biggest decision is to put together
*23:10.380- 23:18.520* :  a commission of experts to address the biggest challenge. It is the security issue and the last one
*23:18.520- 23:25.760* :  is picking the members that will form the electoral conceal to organize the elections. I think
*23:25.760- 23:31.640* :  that's where the real battle is going to be. There's a real challenge in there among these people
*23:31.980- 23:40.180* :  how to put the country first in every decision so things could happen. Daniel Furt is a former U.S.
*23:40.180- 23:45.600* :  special envoy to Haiti and has this sobering analysis of the future facing Haitians today.
*23:46.480- 23:52.680* :  I hope they are successful but hope is not a strategy and I think that's the international
*23:52.680- 24:00.200* :  community strategy right now for Haiti because they chose the seven non observing people on the
*24:00.200- 24:06.920* :  presidential council. So therefore the people in Haiti don't feel that they had a say in this
*24:07.780- 24:16.960* :  and probably the mortal sin of the whole thing is the United States forced the council to include
*24:16.960- 24:24.940* :  the current ruling party since 2011 which has driven Haiti absolutely into the ground and
*24:24.940- 24:34.440* :  is hated and reviled across the country. If the goal is eventual elections whose results are
*24:34.440- 24:41.840* :  accepted by the Haitian people then it's critical that there's credibility and the possibility
*24:41.840- 24:48.880* :  of trust between the people and this interim provisional presidential council. The other problem
*24:48.880- 24:55.620* :  is the internationals have forced the Haitians into this power sharing agreement which they've
*24:55.620- 25:02.100* :  never been successful with. So instead of uniting for the betterment of Haiti they've come together
*25:02.860- 25:11.960* :  in a seven-way arm wrestling contest for eventual power of the country and that usually only has
*25:11.960- 25:17.900* :  one outcome in Haiti and it's bad. The former U.S. special envoy to Haiti down your foot.
*25:18.640- 25:22.780* :  Sri Lanka says it'll hand over the management of what was once described as the world's
*25:22.780- 25:28.460* :  emptiest international airport to a company with Indian and Russian ownership. The move is an
*25:28.460- 25:32.940* :  attempt by the government to reduce losses from state enterprises following an unprecedented
*25:32.940- 25:40.980* :  economic crisis in 2022 and barrage in etharajan has more. The $209 million Matala Rajapaksha
*25:40.980- 25:47.440* :  international airport in southern Sri Lanka was built with Chinese funding in 2013 but it has been
*25:47.440- 25:52.980* :  struggling due to a low number of flights and persistent financial losses. The Indian and Russian
*25:52.980- 25:58.540* :  companies will manage the airport for 30 years but the value of the deal has not been mentioned
*25:58.540- 26:04.600* :  in the government statement. It was one of the big infrastructure projects built with a $4.2
*26:04.600- 26:11.140* :  billion Chinese loan during the tenure of President Mahindra Rajapaksha. The airport is located
*26:11.140- 26:17.120* :  close to a wildlife sanctuary and the Sri Lankan military were once forced to deploy hundreds of
*26:17.120- 26:23.380* :  troops to clear dear wild buffalo and elephants off the airport's runway. Colombo has already
*26:23.380- 26:30.400* :  handed over the seaport in Humberndota to China on a 99 year lease after struggling to repay money
*26:30.400- 26:36.100* :  borrowed for the project. The Sri Lankan government defaulted on its foreign debt in 2022
*26:36.100- 26:42.980* :  and the economic crisis triggered widespread protests. Now everyone loves a whale. Today though
*26:42.980- 26:49.280* :  news of a world first as scientists in the US so they've actually had a conversation of sorts with
*26:49.560- 26:52.260* :  a humpback whale in Alaska. She's called Twain.
*27:02.880- 27:07.460* :  Whale sounds do have an undeniable magical quality don't they but there is more to the scientist
*27:07.460- 27:13.040* :  chat with Twain than that. They've used their experiment as a dummy run for communicating with
*27:13.380- 27:19.640* :  aliens. Victoria O'Hunder spoke to two of the scientists involved. Dr. Lawrence Doyle of the
*27:19.640- 27:25.160* :  search for extraterrestrial intelligence or setty institute and first Dr. Fred Sharp of the Alaska
*27:25.160- 27:31.640* :  Whale Foundation. By understanding the signals and the meaning of their vocalizations it allows us
*27:31.640- 27:36.200* :  to have better bedside manners in their hours of need say when there's entanglement
*27:36.200- 27:41.800* :  or live stranding and these signals are very important. By understanding more about these animals
*27:41.800- 27:47.260* :  we can understand more elaborate communication systems and that allows us to build better filters
*27:47.260- 27:53.680* :  for parsing cosmic signals out there in the universe. And Dr. Doyle if I may bring you in tell us
*27:53.680- 28:00.060* :  more about this alien communication how does that work? The basic idea is you know when you can't
*28:00.060- 28:05.220* :  go to Mars you use Antarctica as a proxy and you do experiments under the extreme cold and
*28:05.220- 28:12.160* :  conditions in Antarctica and just occurred to me that if we are going to detect intelligence
*28:12.160- 28:19.160* :  from you know signals from space that we should practice on non-human signals on earth and so
*28:19.360- 28:25.180* :  there are millions of communication systems on earth and we thought we'd start with humpback whales
*28:25.180- 28:32.580* :  because they depend largely on audio for their communication they're they're very complex species
*28:32.580- 28:38.780* :  they have kind of a global communication system and so we decided to start with them and
*28:39.040- 28:45.640* :  we had this idea that there was a contact call so you start by saying hi and we were surprised
*28:45.640- 28:54.060* :  that the whale turned around and said hi back and stuck around for about 20 minutes and we only
*28:54.060- 29:00.780* :  cut off communication because that's how long our our permit allowed but the whale did not lose
*29:00.780- 29:07.800* :  interest and went off vocalizing trying to say hello again so although it was very simple it was
*29:07.800- 29:14.960* :  amazing what that unfolded with our attitude if we ever get an extraterrestrial signal what we're
*29:14.960- 29:20.600* :  going to be faced with how was very sobering how was that first communication with her like as you
*29:20.600- 29:29.200* :  say when she said hello back well yes Brenda Macau and our colleague was at the controls of the speaker
*29:29.200- 29:34.960* :  that was transmitting and she said she's never had an experience like that in 30 years of studying
*29:34.960- 29:41.440* :  animal behavior the thing is humpback whales don't do it for food they you know a ton of day of
*29:41.440- 29:49.880* :  herring or krill and so twain turned around because she wanted to and was interested and one thing
*29:49.880- 29:55.440* :  we're able to help said he right away with the incident was looks like curiosity and communication
*29:55.580- 30:01.400* :  and intelligence go together doctor Lauren store and before that we also heard from doctor Fred
*30:01.400- 30:07.860* :  Sharp and that's all from us for now there'll be a new edition of global news to download later
