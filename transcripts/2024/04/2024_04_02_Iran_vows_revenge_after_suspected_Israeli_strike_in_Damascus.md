*00:56.620- 00:59.700* :  People fixing the world from the BBC World Service.
*01:05.120- 01:08.420* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:09.860- 01:14.380* :  I'm Andrew Patron in the early hours of Tuesday, the second of April. These are our main stories.
*01:14.380- 01:19.340* :  A senior Iranian revolutionary guard commander is among at least seven people killed
*01:19.340- 01:24.380* :  in a suspected Israeli air strike on a building in the Syrian capital. Our international
*01:24.380- 01:29.460* :  editor Jeremy Bowen gives us his assessment. I think they've seen the way that both Iran
*01:29.460- 01:35.000* :  and his brother have been pretty cautious. They do not want to escalate this to an all-out war.
*01:35.380- 01:39.600* :  So perhaps Israelis are thinking, well, that gives us a bit more latitude to push.
*01:39.780- 01:44.940* :  The Kremlin rejects a media report linking Russian agents to a mystery illness that's affected US
*01:44.940- 01:52.440* :  diplomats and widespread anger in Ghana after a 63-year-old traditional priest marries a 12-year-old girl.
*01:54.960- 02:00.840* :  Also in this podcast, the Harry Potter novelist J.K. Rowling challenges Scotland's new hate crime law
*02:00.840- 02:06.380* :  inviting police to arrest her if they think she's committed an offense. And why have mindfulness
*02:06.380- 02:10.720* :  when you could have this Dutch trend? Nixon is a verb that comes from the known
*02:10.800- 02:17.680* :  necks, which translates to nothing in English. So it's the art of being effortlessly aimless.
*02:21.740- 02:26.600* :  Iran has promised a decisive response after one of its consulate buildings was destroyed by
*02:26.600- 02:32.540* :  suspected Israeli air strike in the Syrian capital Damascus. Hossein Agbari is the Iranian ambassador
*02:32.540- 02:40.000* :  to Syria. Definitely the Zionist regime knows better than anyone that such crimes and violating
*02:40.000- 02:43.700* :  international law will have its response at the appropriate time.
*02:43.700- 02:48.500* :  The country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps says seven of its members died in the strike,
*02:48.500- 02:54.260* :  including a senior commander. Israel has carried out many strikes on Iranian linked targets in Syria
*02:54.260- 02:59.620* :  in the past few years, but rarely acknowledges them. There appears this attack could inflame regional
*02:59.620- 03:05.320* :  tensions. In the aftermath, Syria's foreign minister Faisal Mechdad pledged his support for the
*03:05.320- 03:12.160* :  Palestinians. Our people have grown used to responding to such cowardly attacks. These
*03:12.160- 03:17.480* :  attacks can only be met with further steadfastness and further support for the Palestinian people
*03:17.480- 03:22.920* :  and the resistance, whether in Iraq or southern Lebanon. Our international editor Jeremy Bowen,
*03:22.920- 03:27.220* :  who's in northern Israel, told me more. There's been a big air strike. It's flattened the building
*03:27.220- 03:33.940* :  next to the Iranian embassy, which is in Meze, which is a rich part of the central part of Damascus.
*03:34.280- 03:38.540* :  It seems to have been the constant building that has been destroyed. And with it, General
*03:38.540- 03:44.460* :  Muhammad Reza Zahadi, he's the target because he is the most important Iranian general in Syria
*03:44.460- 03:49.240* :  and in Lebanon. Two vital areas for them. Do we have any evidence at this point as to
*03:49.440- 03:54.740* :  who was behind what happened today? This is a precision strike on the man who would live behind
*03:54.740- 04:00.500* :  a lot of security. He would try and keep his movement secret. So whoever hit him, I think we have
*04:00.500- 04:05.580* :  to assume it's Israel. They had the intelligence, the new way he was, the capacity to level the
*04:05.580- 04:11.220* :  building. The buildings around it weren't particularly damaged. So it was a very much a precision strike.
*04:11.460- 04:15.840* :  So I think what's happened is that the Israelis, I'm guessing now, but I'm sure they have been trying
*04:15.840- 04:21.000* :  to get this man. And they have decided that they had an opportunity. They've done it. And they have
*04:21.260- 04:28.000* :  assassinated other high-level people in his butter, for example, in Hamas in Lebanon in the month
*04:28.000- 04:33.520* :  since October the 7th. But this is the most senior target. They've managed to hit and kill
*04:33.920- 04:37.640* :  thus far. And the big question now is what the Iranian response will be?
*04:38.200- 04:42.300* :  Yeah, it is. Again, it's all speculative. I think there have been reports out of Tehran saying
*04:42.300- 04:49.260* :  that they will respond. But 2020, the very, very senior Iranian general, Qasim Salamani, was
*04:49.680- 04:56.000* :  assassinated by the Americans in Baghdad alongside a militia leader in Iraq,
*04:56.000- 05:04.960* :  to very significant targets. And there were not the immediate full-on retaliations you'd expect.
*05:04.960- 05:08.740* :  I've been talking to people today who are suggesting, well, maybe if they retaliate,
*05:09.040- 05:13.740* :  it could be through some sort of a cyber attack. His brother in Lebanon, and I'm talking to you
*05:13.740- 05:18.900* :  from northern Israel, not very far from the Lebanese border, they have a lot of capacity, much of it
*05:18.900- 05:25.060* :  provided by Iran, to launch missiles into Israel. And they've been doing that on a regular basis.
*05:25.640- 05:29.820* :  It's a very significant escalation. There was one today, and well, I think last week,
*05:29.820- 05:35.860* :  there'd been drone attacks out of Iraq that hit the southern Israeli port on the Red Sea of Iraq.
*05:35.860- 05:42.360* :  This is an important leader on the Iranian side, and they've decided to do it. And I think they
*05:42.360- 05:48.620* :  are also challenging the deterrence, if you like, that Iran has been trying to build up, because
*05:48.620- 05:53.880* :  I think they've seen in the last few months the way that both Iran and his brother have been
*05:53.880- 05:59.520* :  pretty cautious. They do not want to escalate this to an all-out war. So perhaps the Israelis
*05:59.520- 06:03.940* :  are thinking, well, that gives us a bit more latitude to push, and that's certainly what they've
*06:03.940- 06:09.140* :  done now. Our international editor, Jeremy Bowen. Meanwhile, in Gaza, Palestinians have
*06:09.140- 06:14.160* :  described graphic scenes of death and destruction at the territory's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa,
*06:14.540- 06:19.780* :  after Israeli forces withdrew from a two-week raid targeting Hamas Faisis, who are alleged to have
*06:19.780- 06:24.880* :  returned to the site. The Hamas front health ministry in Gaza says dozens of bodies have been
*06:24.880- 06:30.080* :  recovered. The White House said it would demand more information from Israel. Here's White House
*06:30.080- 06:35.660* :  press secretary Karin Jompier. Hamas has intentionally embedded themselves into this hospital.
*06:35.920- 06:40.300* :  It's so we've been very clear, as it relates to the footage, as it relates to the photos and
*06:40.300- 06:45.820* :  reporting, we have not verified that footage. We're reaching out to the Israeli government to
*06:45.820- 06:51.460* :  get more information, but obviously, of these reports are true that is indeed deeply concerning.
*06:51.940- 06:54.720* :  I correspond on Huga Bashayga has more from Jerusalem.
*06:57.760- 07:01.860* :  At Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital, a scene of complete desolation.
*07:02.480- 07:08.220* :  Wall scorched by fire and pounded by explosions, with rooms and wards reduced to rubble.
*07:09.060- 07:13.700* :  For two weeks, this was the scene of an Israeli incursion against what the Prime Minister
*07:13.700- 07:20.620* :  Benjamin Netanyahu described as a terrorist lair. Today, Israeli troops pulled out, leaving
*07:20.620- 07:26.560* :  a wasteland of destroyed buildings, a dozens of Palestinian bodies, in and around the complex.
*07:27.340- 07:32.300* :  Mutasim Dalu, a local journalist, was one of the hundreds of people who went to see the damage.
*07:32.820- 07:39.360* :  I saw all the buildings of Al-Shifa Hospital completely or partially destroyed people screaming,
*07:39.360- 07:45.820* :  crying, they are looking for their loved ones. I saw massive graves of these scattered
*07:45.820- 07:49.240* :  every side of the destroyed buildings.
*07:49.740- 07:54.780* :  The Israeli army said he had killed 200 people who he described as terrorists,
*07:54.780- 08:01.520* :  and that 500 suspected fighters were detained. Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner is a spokesperson
*08:01.520- 08:06.540* :  for the Israeli military. Hundreds of Hamas terrorists had taken up positions,
*08:06.540- 08:12.240* :  utilizing the premises, different wards, different buildings, to conduct command and patrol
*08:12.240- 08:17.260* :  capabilities, communicate with the forces in the north of the Gaza Strip, and effectively
*08:17.260- 08:22.480* :  have created a northern fortress within the Gaza Strip within the premises of the Shifa compound.
*08:22.920- 08:26.700* :  Hamas called the destruction of the complex a crime against humanity.
*08:27.440- 08:32.760* :  For critics of the Israeli campaigning Gaza, this shows not only that Palestinian fighters
*08:33.120- 08:39.120* :  still have the ability to regroup. It also demonstrates a lack of a long-term plan by the Israeli
*08:39.120- 08:45.220* :  military. As not long after its forces left the hospital last year, enemy fighters went back.
*08:45.740- 08:50.800* :  A new investigation has accused Russia of being behind Havana Syndrome, a mystery illness,
*08:50.800- 08:56.340* :  which has affected American diplomats stationed in many countries. The joint report by Deshbigl,
*08:56.340- 09:02.300* :  the insider, and CBS's 60 Minutes, says a Russian military intelligence unit may have been involved.
*09:02.720- 09:06.240* :  Moscow has denied the accusations. Rachel Wright has the story.
*09:06.440- 09:12.680* :  Havana Syndrome was first identified in Cuba's capital city in 2016, when US diplomats began to
*09:12.680- 09:18.380* :  complain of diginous headaches and a painful sound in the ears. More than 1,000 reports of the
*09:18.380- 09:22.540* :  condition have been made since, and people with confirmed brain injuries from the illness
*09:22.540- 09:28.300* :  are eligible for compensation from the US government. US intelligence had suggested that those
*09:28.300- 09:33.940* :  affected could have been hit by microwaves from hidden devices, but said it was unlikely a foreign
*09:33.940- 09:39.620* :  power was to blame. Now, evidence has emerged suggesting that operatives from a Russian military
*09:39.620- 09:46.000* :  intelligence unit may have targeted US diplomats with direct energy weapons. The report said the
*09:46.000- 09:51.580* :  evidence placed members of the unit in cities around the world at times when American personnel
*09:51.580- 09:58.400* :  who were stationed there reported feeling unwell. One victim and FBI agent told CBS 60 Minutes
*09:58.400- 10:04.420* :  she felt like she'd been hit by a powerful force when she fell ill in 2021. Inside my right ear,
*10:04.580- 10:11.520* :  it was like a dentist drilling on steroids, and it knocked me forward, and pressure and pain
*10:11.520- 10:18.720* :  started coursing from inside my right ear down my jaw, down my neck, and into my chest.
*10:18.780- 10:24.380* :  The woman, known as Carrie, said she passed out and later had issues with memory and concentration.
*10:24.460- 10:28.780* :  The Kremlin has dismissed the accusations as baseless and unfounded.
*10:29.420- 10:33.640* :  India is bracing itself for more heat waves than normal between now and June.
*10:34.140- 10:38.500* :  This means temperatures are expected to reach more than 40 degrees or at least four and a half
*10:38.500- 10:43.860* :  degrees higher than average. It also says they'll last longer than normal, making it the third year
*10:43.860- 10:48.680* :  in a row of excessive heat in India and coming as the country prepares for a general election.
*10:49.260- 10:52.800* :  Southeast Asia, regional editor and barrison ethe rajan is in Delhi.
*10:53.260- 10:59.140* :  The Methoff has been warning that the number of days where they expect the heat wave to persist
*10:59.140- 11:06.740* :  does increase up to 10 to 20 days instead of 4 to 8 days. So that is having a huge impact on
*11:06.740- 11:11.420* :  a number of sectors across the country. First of all, you have the mammoth election coming up
*11:11.420- 11:17.040* :  starting from the 19th of April, where tens of thousands of people will attend rallies.
*11:17.040- 11:21.440* :  So that is a big concern because when one of the meetings last year near Mumbai,
*11:21.440- 11:25.220* :  12 people died of heat stroke and then hundreds got admitted.
*11:25.540- 11:31.340* :  It's not unusual for us to be very hot days in Delhi, but we're talking about many hot days
*11:31.340- 11:37.000* :  this month, next month, the month after that. These three months are going to be really hot.
*11:37.000- 11:42.400* :  I mean usually summer is hot in India, but what the scientists are saying is that the intensity
*11:42.400- 11:47.880* :  of the heat has increased. Not just about Delhi, if you see the major cities, some of the areas
*11:47.880- 11:53.440* :  were witnessing five degrees Celsius more than what it used to be. They wage labourers.
*11:53.660- 11:58.900* :  Those were involved in construction work that will have health issues for them. So they have
*11:58.900- 12:03.640* :  to stop work at some point and also agricultural labourers who are working in the field.
*12:03.640- 12:09.820* :  And people pulling cards or rickshaws, that's a huge social problem. If the heat persists,
*12:10.000- 12:12.820* :  that will have an impact on agricultural production as well.
*12:13.220- 12:18.260* :  India is the world's second biggest producer of wheat in 2022 because of this heat wave.
*12:18.340- 12:22.620* :  It hit the overall production and as a result, India banned exports for a few months.
*12:22.620- 12:27.320* :  It is not simply about people trying to protect themselves from the heat wave.
*12:27.320- 12:31.800* :  It is also having an impact on society and agriculture as well as business.
*12:32.140- 12:35.780* :  A lot of people will be thinking, is this more evidence of global warming? Is that something
*12:35.780- 12:40.880* :  that's being talked about? People do realise that the temperatures have gone up now.
*12:40.880- 12:46.460* :  Scientific studies show that 0.15 degrees increasing over the years every year.
*12:46.640- 12:51.440* :  Scientists are clearly linking this with both global warming as well as with the El Nino
*12:51.720- 12:56.580* :  weather pattern, where the intensity of the heat, as well as the intensity of the monsoon,
*12:56.980- 12:57.620* :  both increase.
*12:58.200- 13:03.240* :  Anne Morrison etharajan with me from India. Easter celebrations have been taking place across
*13:03.240- 13:09.140* :  the globe over the weekend, but in Iran, anyone seen marking Christian traditions is arrested.
*13:09.720- 13:14.640* :  For that reason, Christians are turning their homes and even their cars into makeshift churches
*13:15.140- 13:18.180* :  so they can worship without being detected by the authorities.
*13:18.820- 13:23.040* :  The BBC's Sarah Maneta has been talking to some celebrating Easter in secret.
*13:24.600- 13:27.660* :  Tina is cooking dinner for her husband and young children.
*13:28.840- 13:33.400* :  On a table in a corner of the living room, she has made a display with tea lights,
*13:33.400- 13:40.720* :  pastel-colored eggs and a little wooden cross. It's her own intimate way to mark Easter.
*13:42.040- 13:46.580* :  She and her husband converted to Christianity years ago and because of that,
*13:46.580- 13:53.120* :  they could be arrested, so I'm not using her real name and her words are being voiced by an actress.
*13:53.580- 13:57.560* :  It is very difficult knowing that our beliefs could lead to our imprisonment,
*13:57.560- 14:04.280* :  particularly for someone like me who has children. In Iran, some minorities like Armenian and
*14:04.280- 14:09.800* :  Syrian Christians are allowed to practice their religion, but they are banned from preaching
*14:09.800- 14:16.980* :  to other Iranians or even letting them into their churches. So people like Tina can only practice
*14:16.980- 14:20.760* :  their faith in secret, in so-called house churches.
*14:21.860- 14:27.600* :  We meet on small groups and each time in different places. It could be in the home of one of our
*14:27.600- 14:33.740* :  members or sometimes even in a park or in a car while driving. It is safer if each group knows
*14:33.740- 14:39.780* :  as little as possible about the others, so if one group encounters problems, the rest aren't
*14:39.780- 14:45.940* :  implicated. On a special day like Christmas and Easter, the government also intensifies its efforts
*14:45.940- 14:52.100* :  to identify and arrest people, so we've never been able to celebrate Christmas or Easter on the
*14:52.100- 14:57.780* :  actual day. So we have to shift the timing and do it a few weeks later. Tina and her husband
*14:57.780- 15:04.040* :  have received warnings but have not been arrested so far. Many others have not been so lucky.
*15:04.040- 15:09.480* :  One day there was a knock on the door and there was like 10 offices standing in front of the door.
*15:09.760- 15:16.240* :  Mehdi was 20 the first time he was arrested. Due to safety concerns, again I'm not using his
*15:16.240- 15:22.860* :  real name. He says he was kept in solitary confinement interrogated repeatedly and threatened.
*15:22.940- 15:29.040* :  But it was the second time he was arrested when he was 24 that really left mark on him.
*15:29.200- 15:34.600* :  This time I was in solitary confinement for more than a month in the interrogations were more
*15:34.600- 15:40.680* :  intense. They kept us in there for three years. When he was released he couldn't go back to his
*15:40.680- 15:49.560* :  old life. Eventually he decided to flee Iran. According to the NGO article 18, at least 166
*15:49.560- 15:55.460* :  Christians were arrested in Iran last year. Authorities led a spate of arrests in the
*15:55.460- 16:00.500* :  month leading up to the anniversary of the death of Masa Amini, the young woman who died
*16:00.500- 16:05.400* :  while in custody of the Iranian morality police, who had accused her of not wearing her
*16:05.400- 16:11.580* :  red scarf properly. Mansur Borgi, the founder and director of article 18, believes that
*16:11.580- 16:17.680* :  the increased pressure by Iranian authorities on protesters and religious minorities is backfiring.
*16:17.960- 16:23.680* :  They have an alienated and younger generation. Back in our home,
*16:24.020- 16:29.120* :  Tina and a few other members of the church are planning a postponed Easter celebration.
*16:29.120- 16:34.720* :  We have to take precautions because we know the government has plans for those days as well.
*16:35.200- 16:39.460* :  Now you may have been marking Easter over the last couple of days or taking the opportunity to do
*16:39.460- 16:44.500* :  something active. Perhaps you've been doing nothing. There is a Dutch word for that. Nixon,
*16:45.220- 16:47.900* :  our correspondent Anna Holigen told Nick Robinson more.
*16:48.320- 16:53.600* :  If you think about mindfulness that has the explicit goal of being fully present in the moment
*16:53.600- 16:58.620* :  whereas Nixon is about a lessing yourself, just be idle without trying to be productive.
*16:58.620- 17:05.080* :  It's mindlessness and Nixon is a verb that comes from the noun Nick's which translates to nothing
*17:05.080- 17:13.100* :  in English. So Nixon is to nothing. It's the art of being effortlessly aimless and we tend to
*17:13.340- 17:17.540* :  feel guilty about doing nothing but the Dutch are pragmatic people and as far as they're concerned,
*17:17.960- 17:23.180* :  you have to own that nothingness and they've given it this name. Nixon to do nothing without a
*17:23.220- 17:28.620* :  purpose. So what do you mean to gain? Well, if you look at some of the data, the Dutch have one of
*17:28.680- 17:33.780* :  the shortest working weeks in Europe yet they're among the most productive people constantly race as
*17:33.780- 17:41.020* :  one of the world's happiest nations. They prioritize work life balance. It's perfectly plausible
*17:41.020- 17:47.200* :  that Nixon could be part of the secret to that success and there is a science behind Nixon.
*17:47.200- 17:53.000* :  So by building relaxing moments of brain breaks into your days, you can balance your stress levels
*17:53.000- 17:58.920* :  by tapping into your rest and digest response. So a few minutes of Nixon every day could improve
*17:58.920- 18:04.840* :  your focus and decision making. It's all about your frontal lobe, the section of the brain involved
*18:04.840- 18:10.820* :  in decision making and self-control. That becomes increasingly tired, the more cognitive load you
*18:10.820- 18:16.220* :  push on it. So when you rest your frontal lobe powers down and lets your default mode take over.
*18:16.480- 18:20.600* :  So if you think about those moments when you're actually not trying to achieve anything,
*18:20.680- 18:25.280* :  that's when your greatness can really take over. We're told to chill, but then we feel guilty about
*18:25.280- 18:30.840* :  doing nothing. So Nixon, it's about giving yourself permission, recognising the value and simply
*18:30.840- 18:35.400* :  tuning in and zoning out. A correspondent, Anna Holigen, with Nick Robinson.
*18:37.600- 18:42.100* :  Still to come on the global news podcast, Hollywood actresses and close friends and half away
*18:42.100- 18:47.660* :  and Jessica Chastain on their new film, Mother's Instinct. I love Annie. They'd actually sometimes
*18:47.660- 18:54.480* :  makes it more difficult to play friends who then have a conflict. But I think what it does is it
*18:54.480- 19:07.360* :  gives the film an edge. There's been one in spread anger in Ghana after a 63-year-old traditional
*19:07.360- 19:13.420* :  priest got married to a girl of 12. The customary wedding ceremony took place outside the capital
*19:13.420- 19:17.600* :  a car on Saturday. Our African regional editor Richard Hamilton reports.
*19:18.220- 19:24.740* :  The legal age for marriage in Ghana is 18 and the prevalence of child brides has declined,
*19:24.740- 19:31.200* :  but the practice still continues. Videos of this event have been widely shared on social media.
*19:31.900- 19:37.800* :  During the ceremony, women told the girl to dress teasingly and use perfume to increase her
*19:37.800- 19:43.440* :  sexual appeal to her husband. These remarks have been perceived to mean that the marriage was
*19:43.440- 19:51.040* :  not merely ceremonial. Ghanaian law recognises customary unions, but does not allow child marriages
*19:51.040- 19:58.320* :  under the guise of culture or tradition. Next to South Korea, and a story about spy cameras,
*19:58.320- 20:03.860* :  elections and a YouTube influencer. Police are searching for two men who've been accused of
*20:03.860- 20:08.840* :  helping a YouTuber to install dozens of spy cameras at polling stations ahead of local
*20:08.840- 20:14.020* :  elections on Thursday. Asia Pacific Regional Editor Celia Hatten told me more.
*20:14.380- 20:23.360* :  A few days ago, police arrested a YouTuber who had been going online and spouting unfounded
*20:23.360- 20:28.880* :  theories that there had been manipulation in the South Korean elections. They then went on
*20:28.880- 20:36.480* :  police to reveal that they'd found quite a few illegal secret cameras in polling and vote
*20:36.480- 20:42.140* :  counting stations that had been set up for early voting in the parliamentary elections.
*20:42.220- 20:49.400* :  The number of illegal cameras that's been found has now risen to 40 devices that were disguised
*20:49.400- 20:55.340* :  to look like electrical chargers that had been plugged into a wall outlet. They even had stickers
*20:55.340- 21:01.560* :  of South Korean telecommunications companies stuck onto them to make them look authentic,
*21:01.560- 21:08.620* :  but they were actually cameras. This YouTuber was going to use to try to watch the voting process.
*21:08.620- 21:14.660* :  They've actually issued two more arrest warrants for two other men. They believe we're helping to
*21:14.660- 21:21.340* :  install these secret spy cameras all over South Korea. What I'm intrigued by is what use would
*21:21.340- 21:26.540* :  it be to be able to film how people have voted? Well, this suspect, as he was
*21:26.680- 21:33.040* :  paraded by the police, said that he had wanted to check the numbers of early voters. It doesn't
*21:33.040- 21:37.860* :  have a basis and it has been unfounded, but he has a theory that there is a difference between
*21:37.860- 21:43.060* :  the people who vote in early elections and the people who vote in the main voting period.
*21:43.600- 21:48.540* :  So that's what he wanted to use this spy camera footage for. Amazingly, police have actually
*21:48.540- 21:54.460* :  said that they actually found a spy camera that they believe was installed by this same person
*21:54.460- 22:02.200* :  during the 2023 by election in Seoul, where they'd also found the spy cameras installed at the early
*22:02.200- 22:08.040* :  voting stations. Is this a one-off or is it common to have different sorts of election interference
*22:08.040- 22:13.780* :  in South Korea? South Korea is really as seen as quite a healthy democracy with transparent
*22:13.780- 22:20.340* :  elections that are quite free and fair, very close monitoring by the media, but this YouTuber
*22:20.340- 22:26.680* :  represents fears that South Korean politics is becoming more polarized. And also, the authorities
*22:26.680- 22:32.340* :  have said they are worried about other things, including artificial intelligence, the threat of
*22:32.340- 22:38.900* :  deep fakes. And so there are concerns for the wider house of South Korean elections, but I think
*22:38.900- 22:43.800* :  that that's something that politicians in many democracies are becoming concerned about.
*22:44.080- 22:49.580* :  Ah, Asia-Pacific editor Celia Hatton with me. The author of the world-famous Harry Potter novels,
*22:49.580- 22:54.760* :  J.K. Rowling, is invited police to arrest her if they think she's committed an offense under a
*22:54.760- 22:59.860* :  new hate crime law that's just come into force in Scotland. Ms. Rowling, who lives in the capital
*22:59.860- 23:05.580* :  Edinburgh, says the legislation is a threat to free speech. Here's our Scotland editor, James Cook.
*23:06.080- 23:11.040* :  The Hate Crime and Public Order Act criminalises behaviour which crosses a line from offensive
*23:11.040- 23:16.840* :  shocking or disturbing to threatening and abusive. It deals with offenses aggravated by prejudice
*23:17.340- 23:23.600* :  and creates a crime of stirring up hatred relating to age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,
*23:23.600- 23:29.840* :  transgender identity or being intersex. Staring up racial hatred was and remains illegal,
*23:29.840- 23:36.240* :  but one group is not protected by the law. Women. J.K. Rowling says that is wrong. On social
*23:36.240- 23:41.300* :  media today, the author posted about several trans people who are protected, adding that she
*23:41.300- 23:45.340* :  looked forward to being arrested if what she had written about them qualified as an offense.
*23:45.340- 23:50.660* :  Earlier, Susan Smith of the Gender Critical Campaign Group for Women's Scotland had
*23:50.660- 23:55.640* :  predicted a flood of complaints. There will be a rush to report people to the police.
*23:56.040- 24:00.040* :  I imagine that there will be many complaints, for example, made against J.K. Rowling.
*24:00.280- 24:04.340* :  So, there is a high chance the police will be overwhelmed with a lot of complaints,
*24:04.340- 24:09.560* :  some of which will be purely spurious. Scotland's First Minister, Hamza Yusuf, says the
*24:09.560- 24:14.900* :  threshold for criminality in the new law is incredibly high, but insist it is needed.
*24:14.900- 24:19.900* :  We have seen him afraid, right across many parts of the world, it's kind of rising tide of hatred
*24:19.900- 24:23.400* :  against the people because of their protected characteristics. So, unless you behaviour
*24:23.400- 24:27.620* :  is threatening or abusive and intends to start a hatred, then you have nothing to worry about
*24:27.620- 24:31.100* :  in terms of the new offense has been created. Mr Yusuf's government is planning a separate
*24:31.100- 24:36.000* :  law to tackle hatred and harassment of women. But for now, senior police officers are
*24:36.000- 24:40.280* :  worried about the impact of this act with the complaints already coming in.
*24:40.640- 24:44.760* :  China's leaders are trying to find ways to tackle what's been described as a demographic
*24:44.760- 24:51.460* :  ticking time bomb. It's simultaneously aging and shrinking population. One in five people are
*24:51.460- 24:55.260* :  over the age of 16, which is the largest elderly population in the world.
*24:55.260- 25:00.860* :  Pension and health care systems are struggling to cope at a time when women are having fewer babies.
*25:01.520- 25:04.800* :  So, can the world's second largest economy afford to grow old?
*25:05.180- 25:07.940* :  Our China correspondent Laura Bicker has been investigating.
*25:10.600- 25:16.660* :  At the back of morning exercise class, grandma Fenn and her friends are giggling and gossiping.
*25:17.000- 25:21.640* :  They live together in one of China's flagship elderly care homes in the south of the country.
*25:22.520- 25:26.680* :  She's decided to pay for long-term care, rather than rely on her son.
*25:28.720- 25:33.660* :  I'm more open-minded. There are a few people of the same age who think like us.
*25:34.280- 25:38.620* :  I give my house to my son. All we need is our two-pension card.
*25:39.500- 25:44.080* :  In the community room, there are young people being beaten at table tennis by 18 roads.
*25:44.780- 25:47.860* :  They live here red-free and volunteer to care for the elderly.
*25:52.160- 25:57.360* :  The home is partly funded by private companies, so that could help out local governments who are
*25:57.360- 26:04.320* :  deep in debt. But after the pandemic, the home is currently running at a loss, so Beijing does need
*26:04.320- 26:11.840* :  other ideas. On the sunny banks of the Grand Canal in Hanjo, we meet four women all over 55.
*26:12.520- 26:17.480* :  There are new kind of social media star promoting graying gracefully.
*26:17.940- 26:22.760* :  China hopes more over 60s will continue working as the economy slows.
*26:24.000- 26:28.960* :  So we come to the north of China to lounging province. The reason we've come here is because
*26:28.960- 26:33.640* :  it has the highest percentage of elderly in the whole of China.
*26:34.620- 26:40.600* :  Former Digger operator Tang Guo, he looks after six residents. She grows all her own crops.
*26:40.600- 26:47.360* :  The animals too are dinner. She's tapping into the need to find solutions for the large elderly
*26:47.360- 26:54.080* :  population in this province. It's really tough without a pension in rural areas.
*26:54.600- 27:00.620* :  Just see that's 85-year-old man. He doesn't have a pension. He's some pays one month,
*27:00.620- 27:07.160* :  he's taught her pace next month, but they need to leave too. Now I have to pay my pension every month,
*27:07.160- 27:12.800* :  even if I don't eat or drink. But for some retirement, we'll never be an option.
*27:13.440- 27:19.040* :  In a village nearby, we find farmer Han Chao Sao and his wife. Do you have a pension?
*27:19.400- 27:25.320* :  No, I don't have a pension. I guess I will become a burden for my children.
*27:25.880- 27:31.420* :  I'm 72 this year. I think I can only keep doing this for another four or five years.
*27:32.300- 27:39.800* :  But if feeble and weak, then I might be confined to bed. That's it. Over ordinary people like us
*27:39.800- 27:47.300* :  or end up like this. Like much of rural China, there are very few young people left here to look
*27:47.300- 27:53.960* :  after the old, especially after decades of a policy allowing couples to only have one child.
*27:53.980- 28:00.460* :  The rising ranks of the elderly are causing a dramatic imbalance, which means China
*28:00.460- 28:03.780* :  may grow old before it gets rich.
*28:04.280- 28:07.980* :  Laura Bicca reporting. The newly released film Mother's Instinct
*28:07.980- 28:12.420* :  starved the American actors Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain in the role of best friends
*28:12.420- 28:16.760* :  who seemed to have it all, as they raised sons of the same age in the same neighborhood.
*28:17.420- 28:22.540* :  The psychological thriller follows their apparently picture-perfect life in 60s American suburbia.
*28:22.960- 28:26.800* :  Here's a scene where Alice and Salina are searching for their boys, Max and Theo,
*28:27.240- 28:29.620* :  the latter happens to have a severe not allergy.
*28:30.340- 28:35.360* :  Theo? Alice? What's going on? The boys have Max's cookies.
*28:35.920- 28:40.300* :  Okay, well Theo knows he can't have one. He's just, he dreams of trying them.
*28:40.400- 28:43.120* :  Theo? No more cake for them.
*28:43.800- 28:46.980* :  Over here. What's that?
*28:47.780- 28:49.420* :  He could kind of. Where are the cookies?
*28:50.060- 28:52.720* :  Just back there. Did you eat any? No.
*28:54.120- 28:56.280* :  When I call you, you answer me, okay?
*28:57.320- 28:59.600* :  Okay? Theo? Say yes, Mom. Okay.
*29:00.300- 29:01.240* :  Yes, Mom. Okay.
*29:02.980- 29:07.320* :  Jessica and Anne told Dunele McGovern what it was like playing best friends who begin to be
*29:07.320- 29:10.760* :  suspicious of each other and then start questioning the relationship.
*29:11.260- 29:15.240* :  I love Annie. I think she's such an incredible artist and person and
*29:15.640- 29:20.640* :  it actually sometimes makes it more difficult to play friends who've been
*29:20.640- 29:25.060* :  have a conflict developed, especially when you care about the person so much.
*29:25.060- 29:27.960* :  But I think what it does is it gives the film an edge.
*29:28.480- 29:30.540* :  It does have an edge. And I watch my boys forever.
*29:30.540- 29:32.580* :  It's just thinking it was very husky.
*29:33.000- 29:36.500* :  But you play Alice. How would you describe her character?
*29:36.500- 29:41.680* :  And I'd have to say oh my goodness, the glamour and the fashion and the style of this film
*29:41.680- 29:44.500* :  as well as its substance. But let's talk about Alice Jessica.
*29:44.980- 29:48.080* :  Oh, thank you, Mitchell Tavars, who's our costume designer.
*29:48.540- 29:50.800* :  For beautiful looks for the characters.
*29:50.800- 29:55.280* :  And it takes place in the 1960s. So I think that adds to the element of glamour in it.
*29:55.460- 29:58.960* :  Alice, I mean, she's really a product of that time.
*29:59.680- 30:01.440* :  She really wants a career.
*30:01.720- 30:05.920* :  She loves being mom, but she feels that there's a part of her that is held down.
*30:05.920- 30:11.860* :  Both these characters, they're being repressed in some way, which creates the tsunami
*30:12.580- 30:14.100* :  of emotions that come out.
*30:14.540- 30:17.080* :  Celine, tell us about her.
*30:17.400- 30:18.740* :  Jessica just said it really, really well.
*30:18.740- 30:21.180* :  I think both of these women are being repressed.
*30:21.360- 30:25.540* :  And I think Celine has a very delicate equation going on inside of her.
*30:25.880- 30:29.040* :  And she just thinks technically I got so much of what I wanted.
*30:29.040- 30:32.080* :  So I'm not going to think about the ways that it happened.
*30:32.240- 30:35.760* :  And to use a word that I think people are becoming more familiar with,
*30:35.760- 30:37.000* :  she's very unhealed.
*30:37.000- 30:42.220* :  She has a very happy layer on top of a lot of turmoil.
*30:42.380- 30:48.420* :  And so when that top layer is removed and you actually see the pain that she's been living with,
*30:48.860- 30:52.700* :  and what it makes her do, how it makes her treat the people around her,
*30:52.700- 30:55.760* :  how it makes her treat herself, it should be shocking.
*30:55.760- 31:00.300* :  But when you consider a society that doesn't allow a full expression of oneself
*31:00.780- 31:05.480* :  based on arbitrary factors like gender, maybe it isn't that shocking.
*31:05.640- 31:09.620* :  Gosh, when you talk about layers, I'm thinking of one point when you have a black lace mantilla
*31:10.020- 31:14.440* :  over your face. And I'm trying to see in your eyes what it is that you're trying to get across.
*31:14.900- 31:17.860* :  It's called Mother's Instinct, controversial term,
*31:17.860- 31:20.540* :  eternal instinct. Lots of debates about that.
*31:20.960- 31:22.220* :  Do you believe in it, Jessica?
*31:22.560- 31:27.100* :  Absolutely. The most dangerous animal that you come across in the wild is a mother
*31:27.460- 31:32.220* :  with her coves, her children. So absolutely, I believe in a mother's instincts.
*31:32.220- 31:38.120* :  Yes, I've experienced it many times where you sort of go from like pleasant to beast very fast.
*31:38.720- 31:40.480* :  So yeah, I do believe in instincts.
*31:41.220- 31:43.440* :  Do you think it's different to paternal instinct?
*31:43.440- 31:45.620* :  Well, maybe we could just say parental instincts.
*31:45.820- 31:49.380* :  I think an extreme instinct towards a protective love.
*31:49.480- 31:50.920* :  I mean, we could just put it that way.
*31:51.140- 31:52.680* :  And it's not just actors, of course.
*31:52.680- 31:55.140* :  You're both listed as producers on this film.
*31:55.140- 31:57.880* :  And Jessica, your female lead production company, Freckle Film.
*31:57.960- 32:01.440* :  Is it getting easier to get the things made that you want to get made
*32:01.440- 32:04.100* :  as a woman? And what do you think?
*32:04.620- 32:09.080* :  Well, the part that my ear put to in that sentence was the things that you want to get made.
*32:09.380- 32:14.800* :  And I think that it's a whole process, not just figuring out how you get things made,
*32:14.800- 32:17.200* :  but what it is you want to see out there and why.
*32:17.200- 32:21.040* :  I think that there are certain numbers that are showing us that,
*32:21.080- 32:22.760* :  yeah, progress is being made.
*32:22.760- 32:25.520* :  There's also statistics that show it's not happening quickly enough
*32:25.780- 32:28.220* :  and it's not happening enough for everyone in the same way.
*32:28.220- 32:31.880* :  But I do see more inclusivity in terms of storytelling.
*32:31.880- 32:35.300* :  I think you just need to look at the best picture nominees this year at the Oscars.
*32:35.660- 32:39.220* :  And there's a much wider variety of stories being told than 10 years ago.
*32:39.340- 32:40.880* :  There's a phrase that I really love.
*32:40.880- 32:43.940* :  It's a Creole phrase and it's pittia pittia lozo based on need.
*32:43.940- 32:46.660* :  And it means little by little the bird builds its nest.
*32:47.000- 32:48.520* :  And I sort of feel like that's what we're all doing.
*32:48.520- 32:50.380* :  We're all contributing to it, little by little.
*32:51.000- 32:53.440* :  And hopefully inside of a generation,
*32:54.040- 32:55.940* :  they won't really know what it is that we're going on about.
*32:55.940- 33:00.060* :  I do see a difference when I started in the industry about 12 years ago,
*33:00.440- 33:02.600* :  terms of stories about it.
*33:02.600- 33:04.440* :  As Annie says, not just gender,
*33:04.440- 33:07.180* :  but there's just more variety in storytelling.
*33:07.180- 33:10.400* :  And so we're not coming from one demographic over and over again.
*33:10.820- 33:13.520* :  And I see a difference in terms of more actresses producing,
*33:13.520- 33:18.180* :  which is really inspiring to me because those are the markers that young girls
*33:18.220- 33:20.940* :  notice and then they realize it's possible.
*33:21.320- 33:23.240* :  And so yes, little by little, we'll make it our nest.
*33:23.880- 33:26.480* :  Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway with Noodle of a Gathering.
*33:28.500- 33:29.680* :  And that's all from us for now.
*33:29.680- 33:32.000* :  There will be a new edition of Global News to download later.
*33:32.440- 33:34.380* :  This edition was mixed by Darcy Obrey.
*33:34.380- 33:35.660* :  The producer was Emma Joseph.
*33:36.020- 33:37.560* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*33:37.900- 33:38.620* :  I'm Andrew Peach.

*34:27.940- 34:29.840* :  There are different parties, different candidates,
*34:29.840- 34:32.820* :  but everyone knows who is going to win.

*34:36.460- 34:39.200* :  We've seen a crackdown on the opposition.
*34:39.200- 34:41.000* :  We've seen an increase in censorship.
