*01:05.100- 01:08.920* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:10.360- 01:14.500* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Friday, the 5th of April, these are our
*01:14.500- 01:15.340* :  main stories.
*01:15.340- 01:21.140* :  A warning to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from his main ally, the United States,
*01:21.600- 01:27.280* :  following the death of aid workers in military strikes and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
*01:27.640- 01:33.760* :  What we want to see are some real changes on the Israeli side and, you know, if we don't
*01:33.760- 01:36.460* :  see changes from their side, they'll have to be changes from our side.
*01:36.880- 01:43.940* :  On NATO's 75th anniversary and with Russia waging war on Ukraine, Estonia stresses the importance
*01:43.940- 01:46.440* :  of conscription for European nations.
*01:47.200- 01:54.880* :  The star has studied cast a new audio adaptation of George Orwell's dark classic 1984 for
*01:54.920- 01:55.280* :  audible.
*01:57.880- 02:02.980* :  Also in this podcast, Peru's Congress votes against impeaching President Dina Boloarte,
*02:02.980- 02:08.480* :  who's being investigated for corruption in a scandal over Rolex watches and...
*02:08.620- 02:14.300* :  He is just looking forward to enjoying this new opportunity for enormously increased quality
*02:14.300- 02:14.760* :  of life.
*02:14.940- 02:20.540* :  And then we're hoping for is this will continue to function well for a good period of time.
*02:20.540- 02:26.780* :  A potential game changer as a man in the U.S. is discharged from hospital two weeks after
*02:27.320- 02:29.580* :  receiving a pig kidney transplant.
*02:34.260- 02:39.300* :  How much support Israel gets from the United States and its war in Gaza will depend on
*02:39.300- 02:43.980* :  how much Israel takes action to protect civilians and aid workers there.
*02:44.520- 02:49.700* :  It's the message President Biden gave to Benjamin Netanyahu in their first telephone call
*02:49.700- 02:55.000* :  since an Israeli attack left seven humanitarian staff dead in Gaza on Monday.
*02:55.060- 03:00.180* :  It's a big review, calm the part of Washington, is the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken
*03:00.460- 03:01.220* :  speaking in Brussels.
*03:01.820- 03:06.840* :  The President emphasized that the strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian
*03:07.540- 03:08.820* :  situation are unacceptable.
*03:09.420- 03:16.180* :  He made clear the need for Israel to announce a series of specific, concrete and measurable
*03:16.180- 03:21.380* :  steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers.
*03:22.160- 03:27.460* :  He made clear that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment
*03:27.460- 03:29.960* :  of Israel's immediate action on these steps.
*03:30.580- 03:33.320* :  He underscored as well that an immediate ceasefire is essential.
*03:34.100- 03:39.040* :  The National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says Washington expects to see action
*03:39.040- 03:40.560* :  from Israel imminently.
*03:40.880- 03:45.660* :  What we want to see are some real changes on the Israeli side, and if we don't see changes
*03:46.220- 03:49.440* :  from their side, they'll have to be changes from our side, but I won't preview what that
*03:49.440- 03:50.000* :  could look like.
*03:50.000- 03:56.340* :  Now, in terms of concrete steps, what we are looking to see and hope to see here in coming
*03:56.340- 04:02.140* :  hours and days is a dramatic increase in the humanitarian assistance getting in additional
*04:02.140- 04:07.440* :  crossings opened up and a reduction in the violence against civilians and certainly aid
*04:07.440- 04:07.900* :  workers.
*04:08.300- 04:13.360* :  A State Department correspondent Tom Bateman told me more about President Biden's latest
*04:13.360- 04:16.720* :  talks with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*04:17.160- 04:21.960* :  I have to say that this is the most sort of strident tone that the administration has
*04:21.960- 04:27.780* :  issued thus far when it comes to that critical U.S.-Israel relationship because they talk
*04:27.780- 04:33.400* :  about the need for Israel to take what they call a series of specific concrete and measurable
*04:33.400- 04:38.020* :  steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers.
*04:38.260- 04:43.280* :  This is effectively demanding that Israel start to let in food aid, that it brings down
*04:43.280- 04:47.860* :  that catastrophically high rate of civilians being killed in Gaza.
*04:48.300- 04:50.260* :  But then there is the key line in the statement.
*04:50.260- 04:56.160* :  It says President Biden may clear that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined
*04:56.160- 05:00.440* :  by our assessment of Israel's immediate action on these steps.
*05:00.840- 05:05.400* :  Now that will be perceived, I think, as a threat because what it says is, if you don't
*05:05.400- 05:10.860* :  start letting in food aid, protecting civilians in Gaza, we're going to rethink our policy
*05:10.860- 05:11.680* :  towards you.
*05:11.980- 05:13.560* :  Now, it's deliberately ambiguous.
*05:13.640- 05:17.340* :  It's not saying which part of the policy, but obviously the question is going to be raised.
*05:17.340- 05:21.540* :  Are they referring to the supply of weapons to Israel?
*05:21.540- 05:25.240* :  That is the bedrock of policy that's being talked about here.
*05:25.640- 05:31.300* :  So I think it's a nod in that direction for the first time by the administration since
*05:31.300- 05:32.640* :  the start of the war in Gaza.
*05:33.040- 05:37.720* :  I think it reflects the sense of anger or outrage as the White House has put it after the
*05:37.720- 05:40.740* :  killing of the World Central Kitchen workers in Gaza this week.
*05:41.140- 05:45.160* :  Do you know how much time they're prepared to give Israel and a Prime Minister of Benjamin
*05:45.160- 05:47.160* :  Netanyahu to change tack?
*05:47.460- 05:48.860* :  They just used the word immediate.
*05:49.160- 05:52.940* :  Anthony Blinken has just been asked that in Brussels at the NATO summit.
*05:52.940- 05:58.460* :  He was also asked a bit earlier about that line and specifically what they meant by changes
*05:58.460- 06:00.640* :  in policy, what they were referring to.
*06:01.140- 06:03.160* :  Mr Blinken was even more blunt than the statement.
*06:03.160- 06:07.000* :  He said, if we don't see the changes we need to see, there will be changes in policy.
*06:07.640- 06:13.840* :  So again, I think that's meant to be seen as wielding that possibility over the Israeli
*06:13.840- 06:19.620* :  government, given that I think Mr Biden's kind of run out of road when it comes to the
*06:19.620- 06:26.020* :  pressure on him to start using armed supplies as leverage over the Israelis to try and sort
*06:26.020- 06:29.660* :  out this devastating situation on the ground in Gaza.
*06:30.200- 06:36.700* :  Now you're starting to see the language reflecting that a bit more that they are no longer
*06:36.700- 06:40.680* :  it, potentially regarding the issues of weapon suppliers off limits, although as I say,
*06:40.680- 06:41.920* :  it doesn't explicitly say that.
*06:41.960- 06:43.420* :  I think that's how it's going to be interpreted.
*06:43.780- 06:47.080* :  So how will President Biden's remarks be seen in Israel?
*06:47.600- 06:49.520* :  Here's Lucy Williamson in Jerusalem.
*06:49.820- 06:53.980* :  Well, this seems to have been the toughest call of the Gaza war so far.
*06:54.340- 06:59.320* :  It's no secret that relations between these two leaders are pretty abysmal at the moment
*06:59.320- 07:03.100* :  as pressure from the U.S. has gone up and up over the course of the war.
*07:03.100- 07:08.880* :  Benjamin Netanyahu has largely resisted that pressure, but he's going to have to decide
*07:08.880- 07:13.620* :  how to play this one because the language has really changed here and he's going to
*07:13.620- 07:17.200* :  have to decide what to do about that without losing face at home.
*07:17.660- 07:22.800* :  One consolation he might have is the clear U.S. statement of support for Israel in the
*07:22.800- 07:25.480* :  event of a direct attack by Iran.
*07:25.480- 07:30.560* :  That's something that Mr. Netanyahu has been talking up tonight, actually, before a
*07:30.560- 07:36.300* :  cabinet meeting and amid all the talk of whether arms deals could be used as leverage against
*07:36.300- 07:42.920* :  Israel in the Gaza war, this statement of support by Washington on this issue is also
*07:42.920- 07:47.220* :  a clear signal to Iran that it won't leave its ally undefended.
*07:48.080- 07:53.340* :  Meanwhile, the brother of one of three British citizens killed in Israel's attack on Monday
*07:53.340- 07:59.280* :  says he couldn't comprehend how the UK government could continue to sell weapons to Israel.
*07:59.940- 08:04.940* :  Meanwhile, as our diplomatic correspondent James Landell reports, international disquiet
*08:04.940- 08:07.480* :  about Monday's incident isn't going away.
*08:08.060- 08:13.600* :  The airstrikes that killed international aid workers in Gaza have prompted global condemnation
*08:13.600- 08:18.100* :  of Israel, but they're also discomforting and dividing Israel's allies.
*08:18.820- 08:23.280* :  His prime minister said Israel's explanation for the incident in which an Australian
*08:23.280- 08:25.120* :  died was not good enough.
*08:25.680- 08:30.000* :  Poland's prime minister demanded compensation for the family of the Polish national who
*08:30.000- 08:30.420* :  was killed.
*08:31.060- 08:36.660* :  Spain's prime minister suggested the EU should debate whether to reconsider its strategic
*08:37.300- 08:37.980* :  relationship with Israel.
*08:38.440- 08:40.440* :  And in Britain, there was fresh criticism.
*08:40.460- 08:43.880* :  This time from Sir Alex Younger, the former head of MI6.
*08:43.960- 08:49.620* :  It's hard not to conclude that insufficient care is being paid to the collateral risks
*08:49.620- 08:50.800* :  of these operations.
*08:51.080- 08:55.740* :  Pressure also continued to grow on ministers to suspend arms sales to Israel.
*08:56.340- 09:01.260* :  More than 600 lawyers, including three former Supreme Court justices, wrote to the government
*09:01.260- 09:06.180* :  urging it to halt defense exports because they believe there's a risk they're being
*09:06.180- 09:09.040* :  used to break international humanitarian law.
*09:09.460- 09:14.000* :  Sir Alan Duncan, the former foreign office minister, responsible for arms exports, said
*09:14.000- 09:15.540* :  the government had to act.
*09:16.100- 09:18.760* :  I wholly agree with the lawyers who've written the letter today.
*09:19.180- 09:24.980* :  It is quite clear that selling arms to Israel is really a breach of all the rules that
*09:24.980- 09:29.580* :  we set for ourselves when we issue licenses for arms sales.
*09:30.140- 09:34.480* :  Perhaps the most telling criticism came from the family of Jim Henderson, one of three
*09:34.480- 09:39.820* :  Britons who died in the air strikes, who told the times it was hard to comprehend the
*09:39.820- 09:45.500* :  government was continuing to sell weapons to Israel that may be used to kill British citizens.
*09:45.980- 09:48.860* :  What's clear is that the risk to aid workers remains.
*09:49.520- 09:54.840* :  The UN Agency in Gaza, Anra, told the BBC, three of its convoys had come under attack
*09:54.840- 09:59.540* :  in recent months, despite coordinating their movements with Israeli forces.
*10:00.380- 10:01.240* :  James Landel.
*10:02.040- 10:07.540* :  As NATO marks its 75th anniversary in Brussels, Estonia's Prime Minister has told the BBC
*10:07.540- 10:12.700* :  that NATO allies should consider conscription because of the threat of Russian aggression
*10:12.700- 10:14.900* :  possibly spreading beyond Ukraine.
*10:15.700- 10:22.060* :  Estonia has mandatory conscription for all men aged between 18 and 27, and other countries
*10:22.060- 10:27.020* :  in Europe, including Denmark, Switzerland and Finland, have never abandoned mass military
*10:27.020- 10:27.500* :  service.
*10:28.080- 10:31.320* :  The UK and France stopped conscription last century.
*10:32.260- 10:36.880* :  Our Europe correspondent Nick Beek is on the Estonian border with some young soldiers who
*10:36.880- 10:39.300* :  are doing their compulsory military training.
*10:40.940- 10:46.580* :  Despite freezing hands, these new conscripts are now carefully loading their guns and taking
*10:46.620- 10:47.300* :  their positions.
*10:48.020- 10:53.220* :  You can see their camouflaged figures creeping among the trees as the rain pelt down.
*10:53.820- 10:56.980* :  The border with Russia is only 30 kilometres away.
*11:00.100- 11:01.620* :  This is a training exercise.
*11:01.920- 11:03.180* :  There are no live rounds.
*11:03.260- 11:05.040* :  The enemy has not arrived.
*11:05.900- 11:11.500* :  But these young Estonians, now drenched, feared this simulation could become reality one
*11:13.040- 11:13.060* :  day.
*11:13.060- 11:13.820* :  We are still practicing for any threat.
*11:14.340- 11:19.740* :  25-year-old Toivl Sabas studied mechanical engineering in Southampton for four years,
*11:20.340- 11:23.620* :  before starting his compulsory military service in January.
*11:23.920- 11:24.940* :  He's the service for your country.
*11:25.060- 11:29.400* :  You can see that I've completed this army service, and now I'm ready for whatever comes
*11:29.400- 11:30.340* :  in daily life, even.
*11:32.520- 11:38.620* :  Estonia's prime minister, Kaya Kalas, is among those leaders on Russia's doorstep, urging
*11:38.620- 11:43.580* :  their western allies further afield to bring back or boost conscription.
*11:44.260- 11:47.520* :  She tells us how Britain could adapt her country's system.
*11:47.860- 11:51.200* :  We have a reserve army of 44,000 people.
*11:51.400- 11:55.560* :  That would equal for Great Britain around 2 million people.
*11:55.980- 12:01.500* :  2 million people who are ready to defend their country to know what they have to do.
*12:01.660- 12:06.100* :  The head of the British army a couple of months ago said the idea of a citizen army would
*12:06.100- 12:09.420* :  be a really great thing, and he was quite quickly shot down.
*12:09.660- 12:13.380* :  It doesn't surprise me because we have different historical backgrounds.
*12:13.900- 12:17.840* :  We have lost our independence of freedom once, and we don't want to lose it.
*12:19.540- 12:23.700* :  I'm not a soldier, I'm not a singer.
*12:25.520- 12:30.540* :  He may not be a soldier, but 25-year-old Vilum Sadapu did end up pulling on military
*12:30.540- 12:32.880* :  fatigues as part of his national service.
*12:33.460- 12:37.140* :  He and his bandmates, who are performing this week, are a big festival in the capital
*12:37.380- 12:37.660* :  Tallinn.
*12:38.060- 12:40.240* :  We're initially skeptical about conscription.
*12:40.240- 12:42.200* :  I didn't want to do it.
*12:42.460- 12:44.080* :  It's very full on physical training.
*12:44.220- 12:48.160* :  I think the mental tall is pretty heavy on YouTube for like the two first months.
*12:48.500- 12:52.920* :  A lot of people in the Baltics are really saying that in the future President Putin might
*12:52.920- 12:54.820* :  want to go for a NATO country.
*12:54.980- 12:58.100* :  Is that something you think about having done the military service that you could potentially
*12:58.100- 12:59.840* :  be on the front line at some point?
*13:00.080- 13:04.160* :  I mean, ever since the war in Ukraine started, I think it's a very present thought.
*13:04.160- 13:07.980* :  I don't think I have a single friend who thinks in an opposite way or in a different way.
*13:08.740- 13:12.360* :  Nick Beak reporting from the Estonian border was Russia.
*13:13.500- 13:18.500* :  Congress in Peru has voted against opening impeachment proceedings against President
*13:18.500- 13:21.800* :  Dinabolo Arte, who's being investigated for corruption.
*13:22.500- 13:27.220* :  The opposition was only able to muster 32 of the 48 votes it needed.
*13:27.580- 13:30.520* :  Is our America's regional editor, Leonardo Rosha.
*13:31.000- 13:35.720* :  Miss Bolwata is being investigated over the ownership of expensive Rolex watches and
*13:35.720- 13:37.800* :  jewelry issues being seen wearing in public.
*13:38.320- 13:43.100* :  Last week, police raided her home and the presidential palace, but she has regained control
*13:43.100- 13:47.780* :  of the political situation in Congress, thanks in part to the announcement of new government
*13:47.780- 13:50.920* :  investments in Peru's important mining sector.
*13:51.420- 13:56.520* :  The acts of spending will help diffuse opposition from those representing the country's mining
*13:56.520- 13:56.960* :  regions.
*13:57.580- 14:02.280* :  On Wednesday, Congress approved Miss Bolwata's new cabinet, confirming the appointment of
*14:02.280- 14:04.840* :  her new prime minister, Gustavo Adrián Sen.
*14:05.620- 14:12.800* :  Leonardo Rosha, a new adaptation of the famous novel in 1984 by the British author George
*14:12.800- 14:15.040* :  Orwell, has just been released on Audible.
*14:15.500- 14:20.860* :  The classic dystopian futuristic epic by Orwell, who worked at the BBC World Service as
*14:20.860- 14:24.260* :  a journalist many decades ago, has a starry cast.
*14:24.960- 14:30.740* :  It stars Andrew Scott from the BBC's Sherlock and Fleabag, Tom Hardy from Peaky Blinders,
*14:31.160- 14:35.960* :  and Andrew Garfield from Spider-Man, as the main character Winston.
*14:36.500- 14:39.860* :  I wonder how long it will be until I'm still on the gallows for what I'm about to commit.
*14:56.540- 15:02.240* :  This new production is being released exactly 40 years after the date of the fictional Winston's
*15:02.240- 15:05.620* :  first diary entry of April 4, 1984.
*15:06.320- 15:12.260* :  It's directed by Destiny Eccaraga and adapted by Joe White, who both told Michelle Hussain
*15:12.400- 15:12.980* :  about it.
*15:13.520- 15:18.740* :  Well, strangely, I'd only read it for some of the four and immediately thought about Winston's
*15:18.740- 15:24.460* :  struggle to retain his internal voice, the autonomy within this world, within this machine.
*15:24.860- 15:28.320* :  So the first thing that came to mind when I was thinking about doing an adaptation was
*15:28.320- 15:33.660* :  really focusing on Winston's internal voice and how intimate that could be as an audio
*15:33.660- 15:38.500* :  piece in somebody else's head, literally, and it also allowed things like humour and
*15:38.920- 15:44.160* :  very aware of what he was saying always, because he could get killed for any thought crime
*15:44.160- 15:45.020* :  or anything else.
*15:45.640- 15:50.240* :  But also the external forces trying to get into his head, the voice of the party, the
*15:50.240- 15:54.540* :  voice of Big Brother, the voice of O'Brien, and then eventually when he meets her, the
*15:54.540- 15:58.920* :  voice of Julia, or well talks a lot about Winston being able to hear O'Brien's voice.
*15:58.960- 16:03.380* :  It became really exciting to play with whose voice does Winston start to hear in his own
*16:03.420- 16:03.640* :  head.
*16:03.900- 16:07.720* :  Destiny, for you as a director, had you worked in audio before?
*16:08.040- 16:08.580* :  I hadn't.
*16:08.920- 16:14.300* :  This was my first time and here I got to do the thing that I love the most, which is directing
*16:14.300- 16:14.800* :  actors.
*16:15.040- 16:19.300* :  Did you gather a big group of actors together in a room so they're doing the dialogue
*16:19.300- 16:22.160* :  face to face, or were you working more individually with them?
*16:22.420- 16:26.960* :  I worked individually with them and I think that was a great way to work, because I was in
*16:26.960- 16:28.060* :  the booth with them.
*16:28.140- 16:32.180* :  But then they're not even necessarily then responding to the person who's in the conversation
*16:32.620- 16:36.140* :  with them in the final version at that time, it's like you're almost like coaching them
*16:36.140- 16:36.620* :  through it.
*16:36.840- 16:42.200* :  Yeah, so that's why I have to remember what everybody has done, so I can make sure that I've got
*16:42.200- 16:45.800* :  the right performances in my real life, I can't remember anything.
*16:46.620- 16:50.640* :  And Destiny, how exciting was it when we got two different sides of you doing Room 101?
*16:50.640- 16:56.580* :  I know, like, like it was so weird for anyone that's read the book or knows at least about
*16:56.580- 17:02.540* :  what Room 101 is, it's a horrendous horrific scene that I thought I was prepared for, but
*17:02.540- 17:03.060* :  I wasn't.
*17:03.460- 17:09.020* :  One week I was with Andrew Garfield who plays Winston and Room 101 is basically a torture
*17:09.020- 17:11.880* :  scene and it was horrific for me to direct that.
*17:11.940- 17:15.600* :  I loved it because I loved the process, but I hated it and we were not okay.
*17:15.900- 17:19.960* :  I asked him to go for it and he really went for it and it's horrible to hear somebody
*17:19.960- 17:25.420* :  being tortured and because you're not watching it, inevitably it's even worse because your
*17:25.420- 17:28.180* :  mind conjures up all of these horrible images.
*17:28.800- 17:32.620* :  I think my body was shaking, it was just not nice and Joe was so kind.
*17:32.620- 17:36.080* :  He came into the room and he was like, you guys okay, you know what I mean?
*17:36.440- 17:41.560* :  We were like, no, not really, you know, a week later, I'm with Andrew Scorp who's
*17:41.560- 17:46.800* :  playing O'Brien and he's like the torture and my response to it was completely different.
*17:46.800- 17:51.680* :  I was now in the head of O'Brien, so now it was like deliciously evil and I was just
*17:51.680- 17:53.840* :  like, what else can we do to torture Winston?
*17:54.320- 17:58.300* :  I couldn't, I didn't understand what was happening to me and I think that's what happens
*17:58.300- 17:59.780* :  when you're directing, right?
*17:59.780- 18:05.200* :  Like you step into the minds, the heads, the hearts of the character that you're initially
*18:05.200- 18:05.620* :  with.
*18:05.980- 18:08.060* :  Joe, it is extraordinary material, isn't it?
*18:08.060- 18:12.520* :  You think about this book published in 1949, it was the experience of the Spanish Civil
*18:12.520- 18:17.420* :  War and the post-war Soviet Union that was in the forefront of Orwell's mind.
*18:17.760- 18:21.900* :  And yet there are these parallels that we can feel today about mass surveillance and
*18:22.740- 18:22.760* :  misinformation.
*18:23.080- 18:25.980* :  I don't think we're ever not feel incredibly relevant.
*18:26.300- 18:31.160* :  We're now living in a post-truth age of sorts where anything could be manipulated and
*18:31.160- 18:32.120* :  presented as truth.
*18:32.120- 18:37.700* :  People can believe so fervently in misinformation, it's about somebody trying to find autonomy
*18:37.700- 18:42.640* :  and freedom within this machine, it's very densely packed, there's so much geopolitics
*18:42.640- 18:47.820* :  to reimagine and it's sort of a warning and it's interesting taking something that has
*18:47.820- 18:55.280* :  sort of three time periods and it has, you know, 1948, 1984 and 2024, all in one.
*18:55.780- 18:59.200* :  It was daunting but thrilling to try and reimagine for now.
*18:59.380- 19:04.680* :  Joe White and Destiny Eccaraga talking there to Michelle Hussain about George Orwell's
*19:04.860- 19:08.400* :  1984, which has just been released on Audible.
*19:10.880- 19:15.280* :  Still to come on the Global News podcast, the look of how they knew the short, the boots,
*19:15.280- 19:19.540* :  the guns, they wanted it to be sassy and very obviously sexy from the way she looked
*19:20.180- 19:20.900* :  and well spoken.
*19:20.900- 19:23.440* :  What they didn't know was how successful she would be.
*19:23.760- 19:30.000* :  We meet the first woman to become the voice of the video game sensation Lara Croft, who
*19:30.000- 19:31.700* :  has just turned 28.
*19:40.700- 19:46.700* :  Emergency responders in Taiwan are still trying to find more than 600 people trapped in
*19:46.700- 19:50.380* :  collapsed buildings and tunnels after Wednesday's powerful earthquake.
*19:50.980- 19:56.720* :  The magnitude 7.4 earthquake was the strongest to hit the country for a quarter of a century.
*19:57.380- 20:02.000* :  So far, nine people have been confirmed killed and more than 1,000 injured.
*20:02.700- 20:07.200* :  Our correspondent, Rupert Wingfield Hayes, sent us this report from the heart of the Quake
*20:07.200- 20:09.240* :  Zone on the southeast of the island.
*20:12.700- 20:18.340* :  In a high valley gorge in the eastern mountains of Taiwan, a survivor of yesterday's quake
*20:18.700- 20:20.580* :  is winched aboard a rescue helicopter.
*20:21.280- 20:26.140* :  Down below, a six man search team is hauling a stretcher through the undergrowth, on
*20:26.140- 20:27.660* :  it, a lifeless body.
*20:28.100- 20:32.960* :  The huge rescue effort in the mountains here in eastern Taiwan is relentless and exhausting,
*20:33.560- 20:36.820* :  but a steady stream of survivors have been emerging all day.
*20:40.440- 20:44.080* :  They've been brought to this dressing station to have their injuries assessed by teams
*20:44.080- 20:45.000* :  of paramedics.
*20:45.780- 20:50.360* :  Here I met a Singaporean couple exhausted and traumatized by what they'd been through.
*20:50.580- 20:52.880* :  It's yours and I think I'm in truth.
*20:53.320- 20:54.520* :  It's like they show in the movies.
*20:55.920- 20:57.900* :  You remember, I think you're going to experience it that way.
*20:58.500- 20:59.820* :  We were in the tunnel when it happened.
*21:00.180- 21:03.640* :  We felt the earth tremble and we just held on to each other for I don't know how long
*21:03.640- 21:04.500* :  until it passed.
*21:05.040- 21:06.700* :  And so we stayed there overnight.
*21:08.440- 21:13.020* :  The night was a terrible terrible ordeal with aftershocks and tremors and rocks hauling
*21:13.020- 21:13.720* :  every few minutes.
*21:14.300- 21:18.760* :  The shock today has been just how many people are still stranded in the mountain valleys
*21:18.760- 21:20.020* :  along the coast here.
*21:20.300- 21:24.960* :  Not only that's because mobile phone coverage is being restored and so those trapped have
*21:24.960- 21:27.280* :  begun texting relatives and calling for help.
*21:27.980- 21:31.620* :  That should make finding them easier, but it's still going to take time.
*21:31.620- 21:37.720* :  And so as many as 700 people are spending a second night in the mountains, in what conditions
*21:37.720- 21:42.820* :  we do not know, but very probably hungry, exhausted and no doubt scared.
*21:43.560- 21:44.820* :  Rupert Wengfield Hayes.
*21:45.580- 21:50.940* :  Tennis is the latest sport to see a major event hosted in Saudi Arabia, with the Women's
*21:50.940- 21:55.240* :  Tennis Association finals set to take place there for the next three years.
*21:55.540- 22:01.380* :  There will be a record prize pot of just over $15 million for the lucky winner, but critics
*22:01.380- 22:06.080* :  argue it's a significant step backwards for the sport and for women in general.
*22:06.680- 22:11.920* :  Our Arab Affairs analysts, Sebastian Usher, told me more about Saudi Arabia's meteoric
*22:11.920- 22:14.440* :  rise as a major host of sport.
*22:15.020- 22:16.500* :  We've seen this happen with golf.
*22:16.500- 22:20.700* :  We've seen this happen with Formula One and we've seen it most notably with football
*22:21.040- 22:22.640* :  and now we're seeing it with tennis.
*22:22.900- 22:27.660* :  The kind of money is going to be the highest that's been paid so far, more than $15 million.
*22:27.780- 22:33.140* :  And obviously that is very attractive for these organizations, these associations that when
*22:33.140- 22:35.280* :  it comes down to it, they're fueled by cash.
*22:35.640- 22:37.940* :  But this is controversial, isn't it?
*22:37.940- 22:41.440* :  It's already controversial because of Saudi Arabia's treatment of women.
*22:41.600- 22:48.460* :  I mean, it was a very, very traditional Muslim society where women's rights in the way that
*22:48.460- 22:52.940* :  the West sees it are nowhere near what women expect in the West and what obviously most
*22:53.360- 22:56.660* :  of a women who play tennis from the countries that they come from would expect.
*22:56.840- 22:57.660* :  There have been changes.
*22:57.840- 22:59.460* :  There's no doubt about that in Saudi Arabia.
*22:59.960- 23:01.720* :  Women are now very much part of a workforce.
*23:01.720- 23:07.020* :  The morality police, which used to roam the streets and keep men and women apart,
*23:07.020- 23:08.100* :  they're long gone.
*23:08.100- 23:12.540* :  Many women that I've spoken to in Saudi Arabia are very positive about the changes and feel
*23:12.540- 23:16.860* :  they can operate pretty much on the same level if not higher in some cases than men.
*23:16.860- 23:21.380* :  That doesn't take away from the fact that there are still rights but women don't have.
*23:21.380- 23:27.100* :  There was a time when women really couldn't do things without the say so legally of a male relative.
*23:27.100- 23:28.060* :  That is changing.
*23:28.060- 23:33.920* :  It hasn't changed enough and there are women's rights activists from Saudi Arabia and outside
*23:33.920- 23:38.720* :  who've been pushing very hard for that and some of those people have been imprisoned or remain
*23:38.720- 23:41.520* :  in prison for what they are espousing.
*23:41.700- 23:46.820* :  It's not as black and white a situation as it's often painted but certainly in terms of having
*23:46.820- 23:49.200* :  a women's competition there, there are still big issues.
*23:49.660- 23:54.580* :  Tennis icons, Martin and Eratel over, Chris Everett, they've both come out and said
*23:54.960- 23:56.300* :  they don't think this should happen.
*23:56.820- 23:57.260* :  They have.
*23:57.300- 24:02.660* :  I mean, they've said that essentially what they as pioneers getting the same rights for women
*24:02.660- 24:07.460* :  in terms of the money, in terms of the way that women's tennis is regarded as the man,
*24:07.460- 24:12.840* :  they feel that taking the women's tennis now to Saudi Arabia is in contravention of that battle
*24:12.840- 24:17.200* :  that they fought for so long and Martina and Eratel over herself, being a woman who had a long
*24:17.200- 24:19.780* :  period when she was coming out as gay.
*24:20.020- 24:24.880* :  When she looked at Saudi Arabia and she sees a country where homosexuality is still a criminal
*24:24.880- 24:30.000* :  offense, believes that this is not the time to take at the crown jewel of women's tennis there.
*24:30.040- 24:31.020* :  There's no doubt about that.
*24:31.520- 24:32.400* :  Sebastian Asher.
*24:33.220- 24:39.220* :  Argentina is facing a shortage of insect repellent just before a dengue fever season is about to begin.
*24:39.220- 24:43.620* :  It's thought this year could be one of the worst for the spread of the disease due to global
*24:43.620- 24:47.580* :  warming allowing the mosquitoes which spread the virus to thrive.
*24:48.300- 24:51.240* :  More details from our South America correspondent are only well.
*24:52.080- 24:56.380* :  A vaccine for dengue has been developed but while it's rolled out as still in its early stages,
*24:56.380- 24:59.500* :  most people still rely on preventative measures to avoid the virus.
*24:59.500- 25:04.700* :  In Argentina this is proving a problem as the country faces a serious shortage of repellents.
*25:05.020- 25:09.600* :  Residents report that it is almost impossible to buy it with many supermarkets and pharmacies
*25:09.600- 25:11.440* :  displaying no repellent signs.
*25:11.440- 25:16.500* :  In the few places where it is still available, especially online, resale prices are astronomical.
*25:16.500- 25:21.020* :  The government has attributed the problem to a bottleneck and say it will be corrected in
*25:21.020- 25:25.400* :  the coming days, though sources at one of the production companies told the BBC that shortages
*25:25.400- 25:27.220* :  were due to a forecasting error.
*25:27.860- 25:32.220* :  Many citizens, particularly in Buenos Aires, are fearful at a time when cases of increased
*25:32.220- 25:36.960* :  by 2,500 percent compared to the equivalent period in last year's dengue season.
*25:37.300- 25:38.040* :  Ioni Wells
*25:39.200- 25:44.180* :  A 62-year-old man in the United States who received a kidney from a genetically modified
*25:44.180- 25:50.400* :  pig just over two weeks ago has been discharged from hospital. Richard Slamen is the first patient
*25:50.400- 25:56.460* :  to undergo the groundbreaking operation. Surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital say the
*25:56.460- 26:01.400* :  implanted kidney is functioning well and the patient no longer requires dialysis.
*26:02.280- 26:07.060* :  Richard Slamen's previously transplanted human kidney began to fail last year.
*26:07.660- 26:12.940* :  His doctor, Winford William, gave this update on his patient and the life-changing procedure
*26:13.360- 26:14.900* :  to the BBC's Tim Frax.
*26:15.300- 26:20.820* :  Mr Slamen is doing fantastically well and we are quite thrilled at the progress he's made.
*26:21.360- 26:25.140* :  You've seen great spirits. The team is in great spirits too, obviously.
*26:25.140- 26:30.940* :  He has vital signs, his temperature and the kind of kidney chemistries that we monitor daily
*26:31.460- 26:32.900* :  are all meeting their targets.
*26:33.340- 26:37.880* :  Yeah, and I mean clearly you have broken new ground with this transplant.
*26:37.940- 26:44.580* :  How are you hoping to monitor him to ensure that he is well, but also that this
*26:44.900- 26:46.740* :  transplantation is a continued success?
*26:46.740- 26:50.400* :  We have an intense program of monitoring as you can imagine.
*26:50.420- 26:57.560* :  He has two visits a week for the first month and then thereafter if he's continuing to be stable,
*26:57.560- 27:03.500* :  he'll be seen at least once weekly until we are absolutely sure he's completely stable.
*27:04.000- 27:08.380* :  As he's being discharged, he will be seen twice weekly in clinics.
*27:08.380- 27:13.180* :  I don't want you to breach any patient physician confidentiality, but as he talked to you,
*27:13.180- 27:18.260* :  it's all about the sort of the life he is hoping to lead now if this transplant continues to be
*27:18.260- 27:21.040* :  successful, the sorts of things he's hoping to do that he couldn't before.
*27:21.240- 27:28.020* :  He is just looking forward to getting back to his usual daily activities, enjoying his good health,
*27:28.020- 27:34.100* :  really enjoying this new opportunity for enormously increased quality of life.
*27:34.600- 27:40.900* :  The dividend we're hoping for is that this will continue to function well for a good period of time
*27:40.900- 27:42.780* :  and we're confident that we're getting there.
*27:42.960- 27:47.840* :  And I suppose it's worth emphasizing that there are vast numbers of people who are waiting
*27:47.840- 27:53.740* :  for organ transplants and in particular kidney transplants and that the demand is far outstripping
*27:53.740- 27:58.660* :  supply at the moment. That's exactly right. In the United States, there are currently
*27:59.280- 28:06.500* :  90 to 100,000 patients in need of a kidney transplant. This is a huge imbalance in terms of
*28:06.500- 28:13.940* :  supply and demand. It's an unmet health need. The use of a pig to human transfer may be a very robust
*28:13.940- 28:19.320* :  solution. You will also be aware that there are people who say obviously they wish Mr. Slaiman
*28:19.320- 28:23.620* :  all the very best and as has often been pointed out, he really didn't have many great options
*28:23.620- 28:30.400* :  left for him. But the history of xenotransplantation as it's called of animal organs being transplanted
*28:30.500- 28:37.060* :  into humans is not great and it's terribly difficult to extrapolate. We're hoping for the success
*28:37.060- 28:41.200* :  with one patient to potentially be used for others. I mean, what are your thoughts on that?
*28:41.820- 28:45.960* :  This has been the result of three decades of dedicated research.
*28:46.160- 28:51.580* :  She's led to genetically engineered pig kidneys to address some of the challenges that initially
*28:51.580- 28:59.460* :  were met in the first model of xenotransplantation. So we think that these innovations have really
*28:59.460- 29:04.860* :  changed the face of this model. It's a much safer and I think more effective model going forward.
*29:05.540- 29:09.600* :  Dr. Winford William. And finally, have a listen to this.
*29:09.920- 29:11.840* :  Well, you have my total attention now.
*29:13.640- 29:16.000* :  Thank you. Hey Laura, find it yet.
*29:16.700- 29:21.880* :  Patient Zip, I warned you that conveniently undiscovered islands would be scarce in the Mediterranean.
*29:22.300- 29:29.000* :  I won't tell if you won't tell. I have a secret too. I'm the brave adventurer Lara Croft.
*29:29.920- 29:35.980* :  That's the sign of Lara Croft, the character who celebrated her 28th birthday on Thursday.
*29:36.720- 29:42.500* :  Almost three decades after bursting onto the video game scene as the Tomb Raider lead character,
*29:42.500- 29:48.620* :  her star has shown no sign of fading. In fact, she's just been voted the most iconic game character
*29:48.620- 29:54.500* :  of all time in a poll organized by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts or BAFTA.
*29:54.860- 30:01.760* :  Lara has starred in 15 games, three films, multiple comic book adaptations and will be in an
*30:01.760- 30:07.520* :  upcoming Netflix animated series. Shelley Blonde is the actress who voiced the original Lara
*30:07.520- 30:14.840* :  and she spoke to Evan Davis. I met Lara Croft when my agent asked if I would like to audition for
*30:14.840- 30:19.340* :  the role of Lara in Tomb Raider. The voice was being searched for for a very long time,
*30:19.340- 30:24.100* :  six to nine months. They'd heard lots of voices and hadn't found the one. I was new to the game.
*30:24.100- 30:28.980* :  I only had one voiceover job before and she thought it'd be very good experience for me. So I said,
*30:28.980- 30:34.820* :  sure, count me in and they sent me a rough sketch of Lara. I auditioned by pressing play and record
*30:34.820- 30:40.000* :  on my cassette recorder and then I sent off my audition and heard back a few days later that they
*30:40.000- 30:43.860* :  wanted to have a conference call where I had to do more lines and then they told me I'd got the job,
*30:43.860- 30:48.960* :  which was wonderful. What did they know about the character they had created? Was there a very
*30:48.960- 30:53.220* :  clear template or was there a bit of sort of feeling the way going on? The look of her they knew
*30:53.400- 30:58.140* :  because I had a very obvious picture of her in her adventure gear, the shorts, the boots, the
*30:58.140- 31:02.740* :  guns, all that. They wanted her to be sassy and very obviously sexy from the way she looked
*31:03.340- 31:07.600* :  and well spoken. That's what we knew. What they didn't know was how successful she would be.
*31:07.680- 31:12.780* :  How successful even the first game alone would be as they'd only ever done games for children before
*31:12.980- 31:15.900* :  and they said, we don't know, you know, how this is going to do but we're going to give it a go.
*31:16.040- 31:20.280* :  And I think it blew everybody's minds. It went above and beyond all expectation of everybody.
*31:20.280- 31:26.500* :  Well, you must be very proud that three decades on, most iconic game character of all time and you
*31:26.500- 31:30.600* :  were there right at the start. It's really quite amazing and it's something that you know, it stays
*31:30.600- 31:35.120* :  with me because I did the job. Left the studio goes in one ear out the other, forgot about it
*31:35.260- 31:40.440* :  until I saw her on the front cover of, you know, the face magazine and I had to do interviews for
*31:40.440- 31:45.040* :  American newspapers and I realized this is something completely different. But what stayed with me
*31:45.040- 31:50.680* :  for the 28 years that have passed is all the stories from fans. I hear stories on social media
*31:50.680- 31:55.680* :  and at Comic Con's I go to where they tell me all about how Lara gave them the strength to face
*31:55.680- 32:00.300* :  up to bullies. She gave them the strength to come out to their families or how the precious
*32:00.300- 32:04.880* :  memories of Lara and my voice are wrapped up in playing with their siblings or their parents
*32:04.880- 32:08.860* :  that are no longer with them. So that is something that is the most special of all of it.
*32:09.080- 32:13.700* :  It's wonderful to be part of gaming history but the special thing that touches my heart is that
*32:13.700- 32:21.280* :  my voice is part of people's bravery and memories. Other people have been the voice of Lara Croft.
*32:21.400- 32:25.920* :  How is that to you? You, you're the old voice of Lara Croft and now someone else is the voice.
*32:26.340- 32:30.980* :  I'd rather say original than old if you don't mind. I love it. I think there's enough room,
*32:31.020- 32:35.380* :  whether it's acting in films and TV or dancing on stage, there's enough room for everybody.
*32:35.980- 32:40.540* :  If they started on my game, my version of Lara is their favourite. There's been many, many people
*32:40.540- 32:45.320* :  to voice, a middle-of-lubbing turn mini-driver. I just think it's wonderful. What are the lines
*32:45.320- 32:51.200* :  associated with Lara Croft? I think I'd better get out of these wet clothes now. Or you have my
*32:51.200- 32:56.980* :  total attention now. I'm not quite sure I've got yours though. Hello? Those are the ones
*32:57.040- 33:04.200* :  people asked me to do but one I do mostly during the day is no, no, no, to my husband and he's not
*33:04.200- 33:10.580* :  a big fan of that. Shelly Blonde talking to Evan Davis about her role as the voice of the
*33:10.580- 33:16.740* :  original Lara Croft. And that's it for us for now but there'll be a new edition of the global
*33:16.740- 33:22.180* :  news podcast later. This edition was mixed by Gabriela Regan, the producer was Emma Joseph,
*33:22.180- 33:27.180* :  the editor's ever is Karen Martin. I'm Valerie Samdresson and until next time, bye-bye.
*33:35.280- 33:40.760* :  The information spaces we inhabit can resemble a whole of mirrors. It's called guided
*33:40.760- 33:45.680* :  democracy or managed democracy. There are different parties, different candidates but
*33:45.680- 33:51.500* :  everyone knows who is going to win. The global jigsaw is the podcast helping you make sense of them.
*33:51.780- 33:57.380* :  We've seen a crackdown on the opposition, we've seen an increase in censorship. That's the global
*33:57.380- 34:03.240* :  jigsaw from the BBC World Service. Listen now by searching for the explanation wherever you get your
*34:03.300- 34:04.120* :  BBC podcasts.
