*01:09.760- 01:12.160* :  I'm Janet Jaleel, and in the early hours of Sunday,
*01:12.160- 01:14.500* :  the 14th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:15.120- 01:18.920* :  Iran has launched waves of drones and missiles towards Israel.
*01:19.180- 01:21.300* :  The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
*01:21.300- 01:23.600* :  Israeli armed forces were ready to respond,
*01:24.260- 01:27.140* :  while President Biden discussed the escalating crisis
*01:27.140- 01:28.560* :  with his security team.
*01:29.120- 01:31.280* :  We hear what this means for longtime enemies,
*01:31.900- 01:34.780* :  Israel and Iran, and the wider Middle East region.
*01:37.740- 01:38.580* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:38.580- 01:41.400* :  police in Australia tried to establish the motive
*01:41.400- 01:43.140* :  for a knife attack at a shopping mall
*01:43.460- 01:44.820* :  in which six people were killed,
*01:45.380- 01:47.160* :  but they say they don't think it was terrorism.
*01:48.060- 01:50.140* :  And a call for more action to be taken
*01:50.140- 01:53.140* :  to address the glaring gender gap in science.
*01:53.140- 01:56.640* :  We talk to a female scientist whose male boss
*01:56.880- 01:59.040* :  won an accolade for her work.
*02:03.380- 02:06.220* :  Iran has launched a direct attack against Israel,
*02:06.220- 02:09.620* :  raising fears of an escalation of violence in the Middle East.
*02:10.080- 02:13.540* :  On Saturday evening, Iran's elite revolutionary guards force
*02:13.860- 02:16.360* :  said it had launched dozens of drones and missiles
*02:16.360- 02:18.460* :  against specific targets in Israel.
*02:19.280- 02:20.520* :  As we record this podcast,
*02:20.520- 02:23.900* :  they're still to reach their targets as they travel over Jordan
*02:23.900- 02:25.700* :  and Syria on their way to Israel,
*02:26.100- 02:28.760* :  where air defenses have been prepared to shoot them down.
*02:28.760- 02:31.700* :  President Biden has cut short a weekend trip
*02:31.700- 02:34.100* :  to return to the White House for urgent discussions
*02:34.200- 02:35.600* :  on the escalating crisis.
*02:36.240- 02:39.300* :  This comes after days of warnings from the US and its allies
*02:39.300- 02:41.300* :  that Iran was about to attack Israel
*02:41.780- 02:45.160* :  in response to a deadly airstrike on its consulate in Syria
*02:45.160- 02:46.340* :  at the start of April,
*02:46.800- 02:48.600* :  which Tehran had blamed on the Israelis.
*02:49.380- 02:52.360* :  I spoke to Sierra Vashmidi Adeland from BBC Persian
*02:52.360- 02:55.940* :  and asked him what more was known about these missiles and drones.
*02:55.940- 02:58.740* :  We don't know how many drones exactly.
*02:58.740- 03:00.120* :  We know they're in the dozens.
*03:00.120- 03:03.700* :  This was what was stated in the statement
*03:03.700- 03:06.300* :  that came out from Iran's revolutionary guard,
*03:06.300- 03:09.040* :  IRGC, which was Iran's first confirmation
*03:09.040- 03:10.880* :  that these attacks took place.
*03:11.420- 03:12.520* :  And in that statement,
*03:12.520- 03:15.120* :  it mentioned drones and cruise missiles.
*03:15.340- 03:17.620* :  And that's when we learned that it wasn't just drones.
*03:18.380- 03:21.200* :  Another Iranian website that is close to Iran's high
*03:21.200- 03:23.740* :  national security council, which is the highest authority
*03:23.740- 03:26.920* :  that took this decision, as also was stated
*03:26.920- 03:28.140* :  in the IRGC statement,
*03:28.840- 03:32.000* :  that website said that as those drones approach
*03:32.000- 03:35.000* :  Israeli occupied territory and by occupied territory,
*03:35.000- 03:38.100* :  they don't mean 67 territories are talking about all of Israel.
*03:38.720- 03:41.000* :  When they said those drones approach Israel,
*03:41.220- 03:43.660* :  then the first batch of Iran's ballistic missiles
*03:43.660- 03:44.460* :  will be fired.
*03:44.460- 03:47.080* :  And there was confirmation that those ballistic missiles
*03:47.480- 03:51.100* :  indeed have been fired from Iran towards Israel.
*03:51.800- 03:53.400* :  And what do you make of the timing of this?
*03:53.440- 03:55.380* :  Because Israel has carried out many attacks
*03:55.380- 03:57.680* :  when Iranian targets in Syria.
*03:57.900- 04:00.320* :  Why such a strong response from Tehran
*04:00.320- 04:01.820* :  to this consulate attack,
*04:01.820- 04:05.660* :  especially when Israel hasn't claimed it as it has other attacks?
*04:06.180- 04:08.000* :  Well, you have to look at the background of this.
*04:08.000- 04:12.120* :  This comes on the back of over 10, 15 years of war,
*04:12.120- 04:13.700* :  of war, of war, of a covert war,
*04:13.700- 04:16.020* :  of an indirect war between Iran and Israel.
*04:16.360- 04:19.300* :  Israel has been constantly hitting at Iranian forces
*04:19.780- 04:22.700* :  inside Syria and has also carried out a number of covert
*04:23.260- 04:27.220* :  activities inside Iran, assassinating Iranian scientists,
*04:28.180- 04:29.320* :  killing Iranian commanders.
*04:29.320- 04:33.740* :  So I guess the thinking in Iran was that this is not working,
*04:33.740- 04:36.600* :  at some point we have to draw the red line
*04:36.600- 04:39.260* :  and attacking the Iranian consulate
*04:39.780- 04:42.900* :  as the Iranian Supreme Leader said is considered an attack
*04:42.900- 04:43.840* :  on Iranian soil.
*04:43.840- 04:46.500* :  So they felt that they had to establish
*04:46.500- 04:47.860* :  some sort of deterrence.
*04:48.180- 04:51.260* :  They're obviously expecting a positive outcome for this.
*04:51.260- 04:54.220* :  Obviously, the calculus is that, you know,
*04:54.240- 04:56.620* :  as some scholars inside Iran said,
*04:56.620- 05:00.260* :  the decision that's been taken will completely change the equation,
*05:00.360- 05:01.600* :  the rules of the game,
*05:01.600- 05:05.260* :  the rules of engagement that has so far been observed by both sides.
*05:05.660- 05:08.040* :  And the big fear for the US and Israel
*05:08.040- 05:10.980* :  is that this won't just be an attack from Iran,
*05:11.600- 05:14.280* :  that it's proxies and allies could also get involved.
*05:14.640- 05:16.580* :  We heard just reports that Lebanese
*05:16.580- 05:20.780* :  Hezbollah has shot some drones and directed fire
*05:20.780- 05:23.180* :  in the Joll Golan Heights and that the Houthis
*05:23.180- 05:25.460* :  are still on confirm that the Houthis have also
*05:25.460- 05:26.440* :  launched some attacks.
*05:27.000- 05:28.820* :  What the news from that website that I said
*05:28.820- 05:31.320* :  is closely Iran's high national security counsel said,
*05:31.660- 05:34.380* :  they said that this is the first phase
*05:34.380- 05:36.660* :  of a very complicated operation.
*05:37.240- 05:40.560* :  So by complicated how long it takes, what it involves,
*05:41.240- 05:44.400* :  we don't know, it could involve also what another report
*05:44.400- 05:47.200* :  from Iran said, a hacker group close to the Iranian government
*05:47.200- 05:50.080* :  said that they have hacked Israeli radar systems.
*05:50.320- 05:53.500* :  That suggests there might be possibly a second wave
*05:53.500- 05:54.780* :  of drone and missile attacks.
*05:54.820- 05:55.500* :  Absolutely.
*05:55.760- 05:58.080* :  Syabash Mehdi Ardlan from BBC Persian.
*05:58.740- 06:02.120* :  In an address to the nation, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*06:02.120- 06:03.160* :  had this to say.
*06:09.100- 06:12.480* :  The citizens of Israel, in recent years and even more so
*06:12.480- 06:15.640* :  in recent weeks, Israel has been preparing for the
*06:15.640- 06:18.000* :  possibility of a direct attack from Iran.
*06:18.680- 06:20.400* :  Our defense systems are deployed.
*06:20.940- 06:24.300* :  We are prepared for any scenario, both defensively
*06:24.720- 06:27.940* :  and offensively. The state of Israel is strong.
*06:27.940- 06:31.100* :  The IDF is strong. The public is strong.
*06:31.100- 06:34.660* :  We appreciate the US standing by Israel's side
*06:34.660- 06:37.840* :  as well as the support of Great Britain, France,
*06:37.840- 06:41.920* :  and many other countries. I have set a clear principle
*06:41.920- 06:45.400* :  whoever strikes us first, we will strike them.
*06:45.400- 06:48.280* :  We will defend ourselves against every threat
*06:48.280- 06:51.300* :  and we will do this calmly and with determination.
*06:51.340- 06:55.500* :  I know that you citizens of Israel are also keeping your cool.
*06:55.500- 06:59.040* :  I urge you to listen to the directives of the home front command.
*06:59.800- 07:02.460* :  Together we will stand and with God's help,
*07:02.460- 07:05.380* :  together we will overcome all our enemies.
*07:09.200- 07:13.180* :  The Israeli Army spokesperson is Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Hagari.
*07:16.380- 07:21.240* :  The IDF is fully prepared in all its fronts in defense and offense.
*07:22.060- 07:25.780* :  The defense and offense systems of the Israeli Air Force
*07:26.080- 07:29.620* :  are on alert and dozens of planes are in the skies,
*07:30.260- 07:34.500* :  prepared and ready. We are conducting a situational assessment
*07:34.540- 07:38.200* :  with our strategic partners, primarily the US
*07:39.020- 07:41.920* :  and maintaining tight coordination with them.
*07:43.940- 07:45.780* :  Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Hagari.
*07:46.680- 07:49.020* :  Yoona Jeremy Bob is senior military correspondent
*07:49.020- 07:51.500* :  for the Jerusalem Post. He spoke to my colleague,
*07:51.500- 07:54.680* :  Lucuesa Barak, about how Israel was preparing to defend itself
*07:54.680- 07:57.260* :  and what this means for the wider region.
*07:57.920- 08:00.640* :  Look, the country is on a war footing.
*08:00.640- 08:05.240* :  It's been on a war footing since at least Thursday night, Friday morning.
*08:05.380- 08:09.500* :  But now that drones are actually launched from Iran,
*08:10.080- 08:12.500* :  dozens of drones. Again, until now,
*08:12.500- 08:14.320* :  Iran has always used proxy to attack.
*08:14.920- 08:17.200* :  There's Bala, militia groups in Syria,
*08:17.500- 08:18.460* :  militia groups in Iraq.
*08:18.460- 08:21.960* :  This is the largest attack we're going to seem so far from Iran.
*08:22.600- 08:26.000* :  Yoona, what does a war footing mean for Israel practically?
*08:26.000- 08:27.060* :  What are people doing?
*08:27.480- 08:31.660* :  First of all, there are aircraft in the air
*08:31.940- 08:34.280* :  and are ready to defend and attack.
*08:34.700- 08:37.220* :  I'm a tech-Iran. I tech-Iran's proxy.
*08:37.740- 08:40.640* :  So the military is on a huge work putting the air defense
*08:41.280- 08:43.160* :  reservists have been called up for over a week.
*08:43.800- 08:47.280* :  The country has canceled any educational forums
*08:47.280- 08:49.080* :  for the coming period.
*08:49.820- 08:51.840* :  Most of those forums were closed anyway
*08:51.840- 08:53.800* :  for the Passover holiday break,
*08:53.800- 08:55.100* :  but some were still happening.
*08:55.140- 08:57.140* :  So anything that wasn't going to happen has been canceled.
*08:57.860- 09:00.960* :  And they re-instituted certain regulations
*09:01.060- 09:03.220* :  with limited numbers of people that can gather
*09:03.260- 09:05.660* :  so there are large groups of people that could be hit.
*09:06.280- 09:09.160* :  So everybody in the country from the military
*09:09.160- 09:10.800* :  to the civilian population knows
*09:11.280- 09:12.220* :  something unusual is happening.
*09:12.780- 09:16.420* :  In terms of the sirens, when was the last time they were heard in Tel Aviv?
*09:16.860- 09:18.820* :  My recollection is the last siren heard
*09:18.820- 09:20.340* :  in Tel Aviv was in January.
*09:20.960- 09:24.940* :  That was around when Hamas lost the capacity to fire rockets
*09:24.940- 09:26.600* :  from Gaza that far away.
*09:26.820- 09:30.080* :  Once those sirens are heard at Yonet, what happens next?
*09:30.480- 09:34.860* :  So there are people who move into safe rooms
*09:35.360- 09:38.880* :  even before they're people who run to the safe rooms
*09:38.880- 09:42.400* :  who might have 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds
*09:42.400- 09:43.560* :  depending on where you live.
*09:43.860- 09:45.920* :  Yonet, Jeremy Bob from the Jerusalem Post.
*09:46.380- 09:48.220* :  We've got more in the situation in Jerusalem
*09:48.220- 09:50.580* :  with our correspondent there, James Landau.
*09:50.940- 09:51.760* :  It's quite late here.
*09:52.080- 09:54.220* :  So the mood is that people are in their homes.
*09:54.620- 09:56.420* :  There's not a great deal of traffic on the streets.
*09:56.460- 09:59.340* :  We can see some police cars out and about.
*10:00.040- 10:03.800* :  We know people are being warned to keep close to their phones
*10:03.900- 10:07.640* :  where they can get access to the civil defense apps.
*10:08.320- 10:12.000* :  There are reports tonight that those civil defense apps
*10:12.000- 10:14.540* :  are warning residents in a lat
*10:14.540- 10:17.120* :  in the south of Israel, right down at the south
*10:17.460- 10:19.920* :  and also those in the north close to the Golan Heights
*10:20.260- 10:22.700* :  to stay in the vicinity of their shelters.
*10:22.860- 10:24.120* :  So that is the first indication
*10:24.120- 10:28.280* :  that we've got possible areas that may be targeted
*10:28.520- 10:31.180* :  by some of the Iranian drones
*10:31.180- 10:33.480* :  that are targeted on Israel tonight.
*10:34.240- 10:35.880* :  People of Israel have been warned by their leaders
*10:36.260- 10:40.140* :  to remain calm, to trust the air defense systems
*10:40.260- 10:42.560* :  that have been able to protect them
*10:42.560- 10:44.340* :  from these airborne attacks.
*10:44.720- 10:46.160* :  You know, that is the great test tonight
*10:46.160- 10:48.460* :  is to see whether Israel's air defenses
*10:49.020- 10:52.500* :  will operate as effectively as we are often told they are.
*10:53.120- 10:54.600* :  Yes, the big test for Israel.
*10:54.620- 10:56.440* :  And there's also a big question
*10:56.440- 10:58.360* :  that many people around the world will be asking
*10:58.360- 11:00.480* :  how will Israel respond?
*11:01.220- 11:02.740* :  Is there going to be the likelihood
*11:03.420- 11:06.780* :  if Iranian missiles or drones land on Israeli soil
*11:07.120- 11:09.300* :  of an Israeli attack on Iranian soil?
*11:09.540- 11:11.280* :  We don't know the answer to that question yet
*11:11.280- 11:13.520* :  because we simply don't know what's going to happen
*11:13.520- 11:16.020* :  in this attack and what impact it's going to have,
*11:16.020- 11:17.360* :  how effective it's going to be.
*11:18.040- 11:19.980* :  If it is a successful attack,
*11:19.980- 11:23.440* :  if there are substantial successful strikes
*11:23.440- 11:24.860* :  on Israeli military targets,
*11:25.680- 11:28.520* :  and if there are civilian deaths,
*11:29.120- 11:31.580* :  then that will be part of the calibration,
*11:31.580- 11:35.400* :  the calculation that Israel makes in its response.
*11:36.000- 11:37.980* :  If actually the air defenses work
*11:37.980- 11:40.680* :  and if Israel's allies manage to shoot down
*11:40.680- 11:43.900* :  quite a lot of these drones and possibly missiles,
*11:44.820- 11:47.500* :  if the attack is able to be nullified,
*11:48.380- 11:50.320* :  then that then will, I think,
*11:50.760- 11:53.440* :  temper the scale of Israel's response.
*11:53.440- 11:56.080* :  But Israel has been very clear that it will respond in kind.
*11:56.920- 11:58.260* :  Benjamin Dattanyahu, the Prime Minister,
*11:58.260- 12:00.180* :  said we will harm whoever harms us.
*12:00.800- 12:03.940* :  So that is the calculus that is that is in play tonight
*12:04.060- 12:07.540* :  as to whether or not what is already a regional war
*12:07.540- 12:09.340* :  becomes an all-out regional war.
*12:09.740- 12:11.300* :  James Landau in Jerusalem.
*12:12.440- 12:14.720* :  I also spoke to defense and diplomatic analysts,
*12:14.820- 12:15.520* :  Jonathan Marcus,
*12:15.520- 12:17.840* :  and asked him for his thoughts on the situation.
*12:18.180- 12:20.940* :  We have to sort of note what a bizarre moment we are in.
*12:20.940- 12:24.260* :  We have the announcement by a country around
*12:24.260- 12:26.320* :  that it has attacked another country, Israel.
*12:26.760- 12:28.520* :  Israel has said that it has detected
*12:28.520- 12:30.840* :  some of these weapons heading its way.
*12:31.380- 12:33.420* :  Some of these weapons could be relatively slow.
*12:33.420- 12:36.120* :  They could take hours, in fact, to get there.
*12:36.680- 12:38.820* :  Look, if you were mounting this kind of attack
*12:38.820- 12:40.800* :  that you really wanted to do serious damage,
*12:41.200- 12:43.660* :  the likelihood is you would try and swamp the defenses.
*12:43.660- 12:45.640* :  And you would try and swamp Israel's defenses,
*12:45.880- 12:47.880* :  both in terms of the numbers of weapons
*12:47.880- 12:49.660* :  that are used to attack them,
*12:49.660- 12:51.900* :  but also the variety of weapons.
*12:51.900- 12:54.700* :  There are a number of systems that the Iranians have
*12:54.700- 12:56.780* :  which can reach Israeli targets.
*12:57.300- 12:59.240* :  They have drones which are the slowest.
*12:59.440- 13:01.840* :  They have cruise missiles which are a bit faster.
*13:02.200- 13:04.460* :  They have ballistic missiles which go up
*13:04.780- 13:06.580* :  out of the atmosphere and down again,
*13:06.580- 13:08.360* :  which are the fastest of all.
*13:08.840- 13:11.260* :  And so if the Iranians really are serious
*13:11.260- 13:13.760* :  about doing damage, then you might expect
*13:13.760- 13:16.940* :  a coordinated strike by different systems
*13:17.580- 13:21.080* :  all planned to try and arrive at roughly the same time
*13:21.640- 13:23.600* :  to overwhelm Israel's defenses,
*13:23.600- 13:28.780* :  to give its radars and battle management systems problems
*13:28.780- 13:32.200* :  in dealing with a host of targets at the same time.
*13:32.340- 13:35.960* :  Is this perhaps Iran telegraphing very clearly
*13:35.960- 13:38.240* :  what it's planning to do
*13:38.240- 13:40.100* :  because it wants to retaliate,
*13:40.500- 13:44.480* :  it wants to show Israel that it won't just sit down
*13:44.480- 13:47.180* :  and take any attack on its consulate,
*13:47.560- 13:48.720* :  which it regards as a territory,
*13:48.980- 13:51.920* :  but at the same time it doesn't want to escalate
*13:51.920- 13:52.980* :  the conflict in the region.
*13:53.420- 13:54.780* :  Well, look, it's certainly escalated.
*13:54.780- 13:57.340* :  I mean, of course, as we've heard already,
*13:57.700- 14:00.040* :  the Iranians regard the attack on their consulate
*14:00.040- 14:02.640* :  in Damascus as being an attack on their sovereign territory.
*14:02.640- 14:04.960* :  Now, you can argue the legalities of that
*14:04.960- 14:07.280* :  and the nature of the target in a military office
*14:07.280- 14:08.540* :  is meeting there and so on,
*14:09.040- 14:11.580* :  but you know, a direct military attack
*14:11.580- 14:15.300* :  by one state on the territory of another is an escalation.
*14:15.660- 14:20.140* :  Iran and Israel have not traded direct blows like this before,
*14:20.140- 14:21.860* :  so it's a clear escalation.
*14:22.320- 14:25.260* :  In terms of whether this is them kind of doing something
*14:25.260- 14:28.880* :  to show willing as it were and then it will all subside,
*14:28.880- 14:30.040* :  well, that's a nice idea.
*14:30.040- 14:33.300* :  The difficulty is once you fire live weapons at people,
*14:33.640- 14:35.920* :  you presumably expect them to hit their targets
*14:35.920- 14:36.980* :  and do some damage.
*14:37.380- 14:39.580* :  Remember not least these weapons are overflying
*14:39.580- 14:41.820* :  a large number of other countries where they could land
*14:41.860- 14:44.880* :  and cause damage and casualties as well.
*14:45.200- 14:47.100* :  So it's a very, very significant
*14:47.100- 14:50.620* :  and unprecedented moment that we have this evening.
*14:50.980- 14:53.620* :  We're all obviously waiting nervously
*14:53.620- 14:55.520* :  to see what actually transpires.
*14:55.840- 14:56.580* :  Jonathan Marcus.
*14:57.660- 14:59.360* :  Well, the short time before the news emerged
*14:59.360- 15:01.580* :  that Iranian drones were heading towards Israel,
*15:01.580- 15:04.560* :  the US President Joe Biden cut short a weekend trip
*15:04.560- 15:05.900* :  to return to the White House
*15:05.900- 15:08.100* :  for urgent discussions on the situation.
*15:08.760- 15:11.020* :  He had warned that a new Iranian attack on Israel
*15:11.020- 15:13.440* :  was imminent and had assured Israel
*15:13.440- 15:15.740* :  that US support for it was ironclad.
*15:16.200- 15:17.920* :  Natalie Brand is a DC correspondent
*15:17.920- 15:19.600* :  for our partner network, CBS.
*15:20.160- 15:21.360* :  She was outside the White House
*15:21.360- 15:23.560* :  and explained what some of the US preparations
*15:23.640- 15:25.320* :  for this situation look like.
*15:25.380- 15:29.080* :  We've learned that the US has been moving
*15:29.080- 15:31.840* :  additional assets to the region
*15:32.460- 15:35.160* :  to really bolster the protection
*15:35.740- 15:37.680* :  of US forces in the region
*15:38.520- 15:40.600* :  and try to bolster deterrence.
*15:40.600- 15:42.880* :  We're also hearing from our Margaret Brennan
*15:43.080- 15:45.600* :  and Pentagon producer Ellie Watson
*15:45.600- 15:50.260* :  that the US has fighter jets on standby.
*15:51.160- 15:53.700* :  Israel, as we know, says that it's been preparing
*15:53.700- 15:57.000* :  for this attack for the worst case scenario
*15:57.380- 16:03.320* :  of what sources told CBS News could be more than 100 drones
*16:05.260- 16:07.160* :  and ballistic missiles.
*16:07.160- 16:10.500* :  But at the same time, experts on the region
*16:10.500- 16:15.020* :  have said that while they believe Iran seeks retaliation,
*16:15.020- 16:20.220* :  they also believe that Iran does not seek conflict
*16:21.240- 16:25.100* :  or a situation that would draw in the United States.
*16:25.460- 16:28.460* :  We know that the US preference here
*16:28.460- 16:30.540* :  is that the Israeli government
*16:30.540- 16:35.940* :  weight and assess the impact of what's to come of an attack
*16:36.880- 16:39.020* :  and then calibrates its response
*16:40.040- 16:41.620* :  depending on the outcome here.
*16:41.720- 16:45.140* :  Again, experts, I've been talking to on the region
*16:45.140- 16:49.740* :  one Iranian expert from the Middle East Institute
*16:49.740- 16:53.580* :  says that really what remains to be seen
*16:53.580- 16:58.700* :  is how Israel will respond to an attack by Iran.
*16:59.240- 17:02.340* :  And he also noted that the Iranian regime
*17:02.340- 17:06.220* :  just doesn't know whether the Biden administration
*17:06.400- 17:11.780* :  has the political influence over Prime Minister Netanyahu
*17:12.440- 17:16.260* :  to determine what his response will be
*17:16.260- 17:19.080* :  and really prevent further escalation here.
*17:19.100- 17:20.920* :  There's just so many unknowns at this hour.
*17:21.560- 17:23.400* :  Natalie Rand outside the White House.
*17:24.180- 17:27.400* :  So is the situation being closely followed by people
*17:27.400- 17:29.720* :  in the US, an ortho-American correspondent
*17:29.820- 17:31.280* :  Will Vernon is in Washington?
*17:31.740- 17:33.540* :  It's an election year here, isn't it?
*17:33.620- 17:35.540* :  And that plays into absolutely everything
*17:35.580- 17:39.260* :  and relations with Israel, especially of course,
*17:39.840- 17:40.840* :  with the war in Gaza.
*17:41.280- 17:43.520* :  That has become an election issue here
*17:43.920- 17:45.560* :  and there are large groups of voters,
*17:46.460- 17:48.580* :  many traditionally Democrat voters
*17:48.900- 17:51.960* :  who are extremely unhappy with President Biden's support
*17:51.980- 17:53.040* :  for Israel.
*17:53.360- 17:56.100* :  There are large groups of them, these voters
*17:56.100- 17:59.540* :  who are minority groups, are young voters,
*18:00.080- 18:02.800* :  exactly the kind of people that Joe Biden needs
*18:02.800- 18:05.960* :  if he has any hope whatsoever of remaining
*18:05.960- 18:07.480* :  in the White House come November
*18:07.480- 18:09.520* :  in that crucial presidential election.
*18:09.640- 18:12.220* :  So absolutely is being followed closely here
*18:12.220- 18:14.360* :  by all the US networks, by ordinary Americans
*18:14.360- 18:17.720* :  in the context of that wider issue of the war in Gaza,
*18:18.100- 18:20.880* :  but also of course, in terms of the security
*18:20.880- 18:23.680* :  of America's most important ally in the Middle East.
*18:24.360- 18:27.660* :  Will Vernon, Iran has long avoided direct conflict
*18:27.660- 18:30.040* :  with Israel by operating through proxies
*18:30.040- 18:32.800* :  and allies like Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen
*18:32.800- 18:34.200* :  or Hezbollah in Lebanon.
*18:34.980- 18:37.460* :  So what does this unprecedented attack mean
*18:37.460- 18:38.640* :  for the wider region?
*18:38.700- 18:41.560* :  Here's our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Usher.
*18:41.900- 18:45.620* :  I think to be honest, the ball is really in Israel's court
*18:45.620- 18:47.040* :  now whether they want to make this
*18:47.040- 18:49.500* :  into a bigger confrontation, a bigger escalation.
*18:50.240- 18:53.600* :  All the talk that we're hearing from Israel is exactly that.
*18:54.280- 18:56.960* :  This is a game essentially that's been played by Iran
*18:56.960- 18:59.320* :  in Israel for years and years, for Shadow War,
*18:59.320- 19:01.300* :  the one that's come up more into the open Iran
*19:01.300- 19:05.040* :  has used its proxies in Lebanon, in Yemen, in Syria,
*19:05.040- 19:09.540* :  in Iraq, time and time again, against Israeli linked targets
*19:09.540- 19:12.880* :  since October the 7th, against the US targets very often
*19:12.880- 19:15.420* :  before that, against Saudi targets,
*19:15.920- 19:18.380* :  against the panoply, essentially, of countries
*19:18.380- 19:22.240* :  with which Iran has had hostile relations.
*19:23.220- 19:26.600* :  So this is taking us into uncharted territory.
*19:26.600- 19:28.160* :  There's no doubt about that.
*19:28.920- 19:31.140* :  But I think we need to hold back for the moment
*19:31.800- 19:34.620* :  for several hours to really think about how big
*19:34.620- 19:37.320* :  and how far this could go as an escalation.
*19:37.940- 19:40.360* :  I mean, we've heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
*19:40.360- 19:45.400* :  for years that he believes that a war against Iran,
*19:45.400- 19:48.340* :  essentially, by Israel, spearheaded by Israel,
*19:48.340- 19:50.680* :  but backed by the West, by the US in particular,
*19:51.160- 19:53.900* :  is essential, and that was to do with Iran's development
*19:53.900- 19:57.360* :  potentially of a nuclear weapon, which Netanyahu
*19:57.360- 20:00.260* :  sees as an existential threat to Israel.
*20:00.260- 20:03.420* :  I think if Iran did have a nuclear weapon, obviously, again,
*20:03.420- 20:05.840* :  we'd be in an even darker, more difficult situation.
*20:05.900- 20:06.760* :  That isn't the case.
*20:07.780- 20:11.600* :  So there will be huge efforts by the US,
*20:12.360- 20:15.780* :  by the inshash commune, to try to bring this down
*20:16.240- 20:18.580* :  by the neighbors of Israel and Iran as well,
*20:18.580- 20:22.300* :  the Arab countries, all of whom have it in their interest
*20:22.300- 20:26.220* :  with this not to escalate, not to become something
*20:26.260- 20:28.780* :  which could spark into a regional war.
*20:29.120- 20:30.140* :  Sebastian Usher.
*20:32.680- 20:35.380* :  Still to come, we hear how a boat carrying the bodies
*20:35.380- 20:38.040* :  of 20 people thought to be migrants from Haiti
*20:38.500- 20:40.500* :  was found thousands of kilometers away
*20:40.500- 20:42.720* :  in Brazil's Amazon rainforest.
*20:50.960- 20:51.940* :  Flexibility is great.
*20:51.940- 20:52.980* :  That's why there's yoga.
*20:53.380- 20:55.680* :  Flexibility for your insurance coverage is great too.
*20:56.080- 20:58.480* :  That's why there's United Healthcare Insurance Plans.
*20:58.820- 21:00.540* :  Underwritten by Golden Roll Insurance Company,
*21:00.980- 21:03.780* :  United Healthcare Insurance Plans offer flexible, budget-friendly
*21:03.780- 21:06.020* :  coverage for medical, vision, dental, and more.

*21:08.340- 21:11.140* :  if you're say, between jobs, coming off your parents' plan,
*21:11.140- 21:13.160* :  turning a side hustle into a full hustle,
*21:13.560- 21:14.960* :  or even missed open enrollment.

*21:22.520- 21:24.660* :  With the price of just about everything going up

*21:58.020- 22:02.080* :  Now turning to other news away from Iran and Israel,
*22:02.620- 22:06.720* :  Australian police say it's too early to say what the motive was
*22:06.820- 22:09.340* :  for a stabbing attack that left six people dead,
*22:09.340- 22:12.240* :  most of them women at a shopping center in Sydney.
*22:12.340- 22:15.080* :  But they don't believe it's terror related.
*22:15.580- 22:18.420* :  The lone attacker was shot dead by a female officer.
*22:19.000- 22:21.200* :  The suspect has thought to be a 40-year-old
*22:21.200- 22:22.260* :  known to the authorities.
*22:22.860- 22:24.580* :  Eight people are being treated in hospital,
*22:24.980- 22:28.580* :  including a nine-month-old baby who had emergency surgery.
*22:29.100- 22:31.260* :  Her mother is believed to be among the dead.
*22:31.840- 22:33.880* :  Film Mercer sent this report from Sydney.
*22:40.320- 22:43.360* :  Police were called to the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping
*22:43.360- 22:47.540* :  center just before four o'clock in the afternoon, local time
*22:48.120- 22:50.400* :  after reports of a man with a knife.
*22:51.220- 22:54.200* :  Shoppers fled in panic or tried to seek shelter
*22:54.660- 22:54.840* :  inside.
*22:55.600- 22:57.040* :  This woman was one of them.
*22:57.060- 22:59.160* :  And I was hiding in the backroom.
*22:59.220- 23:00.480* :  I just hear gunshots.
*23:02.340- 23:04.020* :  It's just like the whole thing ever.
*23:05.220- 23:06.500* :  Like we've just got to people.
*23:07.320- 23:11.020* :  Teams of police surrounded the building and the attacker was shot
*23:11.020- 23:14.420* :  dead by a police officer inside the shopping center.
*23:15.320- 23:18.840* :  The New South Wales Assistant Police Commissioner Anthony Cook
*23:19.600- 23:20.600* :  explained what happened.
*23:21.240- 23:24.160* :  A single unit officer, Inspector of Police,
*23:24.160- 23:28.340* :  was nearby, attended, went into the center,
*23:28.340- 23:30.260* :  directed by a range of people.
*23:31.380- 23:34.560* :  She confronted the offender who had moved by this stage
*23:34.560- 23:41.620* :  to level five, as she continued to walk quickly behind him
*23:41.620- 23:42.780* :  to catch up with him.
*23:42.780- 23:45.320* :  He turned, faced her, raised a knife.
*23:45.940- 23:49.060* :  She discharged to firearm, and that person is now deceased.
*23:49.720- 23:50.840* :  This man was nearby.
*23:50.900- 23:53.120* :  Just coming around the corner, there he was.
*23:53.120- 23:55.180* :  He just started just starting to fly towards us.
*23:55.240- 23:56.820* :  And all of a sudden he was put it down.
*23:57.780- 23:59.780* :  And then she shot him.
*24:00.240- 24:01.200* :  She she didn't shoot him.
*24:01.420- 24:02.860* :  Well, he would have kept going.
*24:02.860- 24:03.680* :  He was on the rampage.
*24:03.680- 24:05.080* :  He was on the rampage.
*24:05.320- 24:08.040* :  Several people, including a nine-month-old baby,
*24:08.480- 24:09.900* :  have been taken to hospital,
*24:10.600- 24:12.260* :  summer in a critical condition.
*24:13.200- 24:15.880* :  The New South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb
*24:15.880- 24:19.040* :  later gave an update on the police investigation.
*24:20.160- 24:22.620* :  She said officers believe they knew the identity
*24:22.620- 24:26.460* :  of the attacker and thought he was a 40-year-old man.
*24:27.040- 24:29.340* :  If, in fact, it is the person that we believe it is,
*24:29.760- 24:34.600* :  then we don't have fees for that person holding an ideation.
*24:35.520- 24:38.940* :  In other words, that it's not a terrorism incident.
*24:39.540- 24:41.360* :  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese,
*24:41.360- 24:45.080* :  he praised the police officer who shot dead the knife man.
*24:45.760- 24:49.160* :  He described her as a hero and said there was no doubt
*24:49.160- 24:51.360* :  she'd saved lives through her actions.
*24:52.380- 24:56.120* :  He added that the attack had been beyond words or understanding.
*24:56.920- 24:58.400* :  Phil Mercer in Australia.
*24:59.160- 25:00.940* :  A boat with the bodies of 20 people
*25:00.940- 25:02.540* :  believed to be migrants from Haiti
*25:02.540- 25:06.120* :  has been found on a river in Brazil's Amazon rainforest region.
*25:06.700- 25:09.080* :  With more details, here's our America's regional editor,
*25:09.440- 25:10.160* :  Leonardo Russia.
*25:10.520- 25:12.480* :  The boat was found on a deserted beach
*25:12.480- 25:14.480* :  where the river meets the Atlantic Ocean
*25:14.880- 25:16.940* :  in the northern Brazilian state of Pará,
*25:17.380- 25:20.080* :  more than 3,000 kilometers away from Haiti.
*25:20.600- 25:23.200* :  Local media say they were probably sailing at sea
*25:23.500- 25:25.740* :  and were pushed inland by the strong ties
*25:25.740- 25:27.080* :  that are common in the region.
*25:27.540- 25:30.140* :  Thousands of Haitians leave the country every month,
*25:30.500- 25:33.040* :  trying to escape poverty and lawlessness at home.
*25:33.500- 25:35.780* :  Many fly to Brazil or neighboring countries,
*25:35.780- 25:39.280* :  but attempts to reach South America by boat are rare.
*25:39.580- 25:40.400* :  Leonardo Russia.
*25:41.180- 25:43.660* :  A recent UN report has called for the closing
*25:43.660- 25:45.540* :  of the gender gap in science.
*25:46.020- 25:48.680* :  Less than a third of engineering graduates or women
*25:48.680- 25:50.920* :  and in physics is less than a fifth.
*25:51.420- 25:53.720* :  On top of that, a survey of students here in the UK
*25:53.720- 25:56.080* :  found female students in science subjects
*25:56.680- 25:58.920* :  experience far greater levels of sexism
*25:59.320- 26:00.780* :  than those studying in other areas.
*26:01.560- 26:03.180* :  However, long-term campaigners say
*26:03.180- 26:05.140* :  this discrimination is nothing new.
*26:05.320- 26:07.320* :  They point to the male dominated management
*26:07.320- 26:08.780* :  of scientific institutions
*26:08.780- 26:12.120* :  and a tiny number of top science prizes given to women.
*26:12.920- 26:14.540* :  One of those most famously overlooked
*26:14.540- 26:17.500* :  for a Nobel Prize, the most prestigious award in science,
*26:17.840- 26:20.060* :  is the astronomer, Jocelyn Bell Bernel.
*26:20.640- 26:24.100* :  In 1967, her male boss was given the accolade
*26:24.100- 26:27.660* :  for her discovery of the pulsar, a new kind of star.
*26:28.420- 26:30.460* :  She has since become a leading advocate
*26:30.460- 26:32.960* :  for greater diversity in science.
*26:33.660- 26:35.760* :  Nulema Governe met Professor Bell Bernel
*26:35.760- 26:37.380* :  recently at a literature festival.
*26:37.860- 26:39.860* :  They discussed that huge discovery
*26:40.220- 26:41.860* :  and a fallout over the prize.
*26:42.480- 26:46.000* :  Along with the data that I'm meant to be gathering,
*26:47.080- 26:50.020* :  there's just occasionally a little signal
*26:50.020- 26:51.240* :  that doesn't make sense.
*26:51.860- 26:54.620* :  Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.
*26:55.900- 26:58.460* :  And I could see that the blips were equally spaced
*26:59.240- 27:00.640* :  and once that source had passed,
*27:00.640- 27:02.060* :  it was gone for the day.
*27:02.820- 27:04.920* :  So then I go to my long-suffering supervisor
*27:04.920- 27:07.100* :  and says, Tony, that funny signal.
*27:07.880- 27:10.540* :  It's a string of pulses, one and a third seconds apart.
*27:11.260- 27:13.460* :  Oh, that settles it.
*27:14.680- 27:15.700* :  It's interference.
*27:16.760- 27:18.520* :  We've got this very big radio telescope,
*27:18.520- 27:19.560* :  very sensitive.
*27:20.120- 27:23.380* :  In addition to picking up the rather faint cosmic radio signals,
*27:24.040- 27:25.380* :  it'll pick up anything else
*27:25.380- 27:27.220* :  that's broadcasting at that wave band.
*27:28.120- 27:30.840* :  Pirate radio stations, badly suppressed cars,
*27:31.600- 27:33.600* :  you name it, but he was wrong.
*27:35.180- 27:37.300* :  Ultimately, it turned out he was wrong.
*27:37.880- 27:39.660* :  First of all, he came and checked
*27:39.660- 27:41.420* :  that I'd wired everything up correctly,
*27:41.420- 27:43.180* :  so he stood looking over my shoulder
*27:44.080- 27:46.520* :  and agreed that, yep, and on the next day,
*27:46.520- 27:49.820* :  it was still beating same time, same period, same place.
*27:51.300- 27:55.120* :  So then we quietly ask a colleague and his grad student
*27:55.840- 27:57.860* :  that other piece of kit picked it up as well.
*27:58.600- 27:59.680* :  Did you feel vindicated?
*28:00.360- 28:02.860* :  Very much so, yes, very, very much so.
*28:03.640- 28:07.040* :  But in a sense, it was getting too exciting, too important
*28:07.680- 28:10.560* :  because you don't leave that kind of thing to a grad student.
*28:11.200- 28:14.380* :  Is it the grad student or is it the female grad student?
*28:15.340- 28:17.960* :  I'm sure a female was a factor in it, yes,
*28:18.360- 28:19.820* :  but also a grad student.
*28:21.260- 28:25.320* :  The Nobel Prize was awarded for the Pulsar in the 70s,
*28:25.320- 28:27.960* :  but it was awarded to Tony Hewish.
*28:29.100- 28:30.840* :  When I look him up online now,
*28:30.840- 28:34.100* :  it comes up notable student, Jocelyn Bell Bernal.
*28:35.900- 28:36.460* :  How did you feel?
*28:36.960- 28:40.020* :  When he was awarded that prize?
*28:40.800- 28:43.020* :  It's a day I remember very, very well
*28:43.020- 28:45.860* :  because by then I was working in X-ray astronomy,
*28:46.560- 28:47.620* :  which you do with satellites.
*28:48.400- 28:51.460* :  And our satellite was launching that morning about eight o'clock.
*28:52.440- 28:54.820* :  And then at about five past midday,
*28:55.560- 28:57.500* :  a colleague came rushing into my office.
*28:57.860- 28:58.560* :  Have you heard the news?
*28:58.560- 28:59.400* :  Have you heard the news?
*28:59.920- 29:02.380* :  Oh my God, the satellite's gone in the drink.
*29:04.160- 29:04.860* :  And it wasn't.
*29:05.420- 29:08.620* :  It was the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Physics
*29:09.380- 29:11.480* :  to my thesis advisor, Tony Hewish,
*29:12.160- 29:15.280* :  and the professor who was head of the department, Martin Ryle.
*29:15.920- 29:19.540* :  There was backlash on your behalf because of that.
*29:20.520- 29:21.160* :  What did you think?
*29:22.240- 29:26.940* :  I was very pleased that there was a Nobel Prize at last
*29:26.940- 29:28.400* :  for something in astronomy.
*29:29.760- 29:31.600* :  There's no astronomy Nobel Prize.
*29:32.400- 29:34.980* :  You're going to be part of the Physics Nobel Prize
*29:34.980- 29:35.940* :  if you're there at all.
*29:36.720- 29:39.740* :  And that year was literally the first year
*29:39.740- 29:42.980* :  that anything astronomical had been recognized
*29:42.980- 29:44.820* :  by the Physics Prize Committee.
*29:45.160- 29:50.460* :  But weren't you frustrated, angry, obsessed, and proud?
*29:51.060- 29:53.160* :  Well, so you should be because you're discovery
*29:53.160- 29:55.200* :  not being awarded a Nobel Prize,
*29:55.200- 29:56.920* :  but you hadn't been given the credit.
*29:57.320- 29:59.040* :  Yeah, but it was more important
*29:59.040- 30:00.940* :  that they had recognized astronomy.
*30:01.440- 30:04.060* :  After they discovered you and Tony Hewish were interviewed
*30:04.880- 30:06.260* :  about the discovery.
*30:06.280- 30:08.400* :  Well, on the pretext of the discovery,
*30:08.400- 30:10.480* :  but the questions you were given compared to Tony
*30:10.480- 30:11.240* :  were very different.
*30:12.400- 30:15.120* :  He was asked about the discovery about the pulsar.
*30:15.640- 30:17.800* :  And you were asked about whether you had a boyfriend
*30:19.020- 30:23.000* :  or, I don't know, lifestyle questions for a woman.
*30:23.560- 30:26.300* :  Yeah, certainly the press were interested
*30:26.300- 30:28.120* :  in my bust waist and hip measurements
*30:28.860- 30:30.380* :  and how many boyfriends I had,
*30:31.160- 30:33.240* :  whereas they talked to Tony about the pulsars.
*30:33.720- 30:36.400* :  The astronomer, Professor Justin Bell Bennell.
*30:37.220- 30:39.240* :  Now, let's return to our main story.
*30:39.740- 30:42.020* :  Iran's launch of an aerial attack
*30:42.020- 30:44.560* :  on Israel involving drones and missiles.
*30:45.320- 30:46.560* :  At one stage in the evening,
*30:46.560- 30:49.060* :  Iranian sources were reported to have said
*30:49.060- 30:50.660* :  the operation was over.
*30:51.420- 30:52.440* :  For his final assessment,
*30:52.440- 30:55.360* :  here's Seir Vashamedi Ardlan from BBC Persian.
*30:55.640- 30:57.740* :  This was a breaking news that just came in.
*30:57.740- 30:59.780* :  Basically, it means Iran is saying
*30:59.780- 31:01.860* :  that this operation has concluded
*31:02.300- 31:04.700* :  that it's no longer firing any drones
*31:04.700- 31:06.540* :  or missiles towards Israel,
*31:06.540- 31:08.760* :  even though we still don't have any indication
*31:09.320- 31:12.620* :  that those cruise missiles have been fired towards Israel.
*31:12.620- 31:16.400* :  What we have confirmation of is the shooting
*31:16.400- 31:20.200* :  of several or dozens of drones towards Israel.
*31:20.200- 31:23.660* :  Now, whether what the Iranian permanent mission
*31:23.660- 31:26.740* :  to the UN said is really a reflection
*31:26.800- 31:28.400* :  of what's going on on the ground,
*31:28.400- 31:31.880* :  because it runs contradictory to media reports
*31:31.980- 31:33.840* :  that we're getting inside Iran
*31:33.840- 31:37.560* :  from the revolutionary guard affiliated news websites
*31:37.560- 31:40.420* :  that just a few moments ago have said
*31:41.040- 31:43.580* :  that once the drones approach Israel,
*31:44.120- 31:48.520* :  the first phase of Iran's complicated operation will begin.
*31:49.240- 31:52.080* :  So we're not sure whether the operation has concluded
*31:52.080- 31:55.060* :  as the Iranian diplomatic mission to the UN has said,
*31:55.500- 31:58.240* :  or whether this is part of a longer operation
*31:58.280- 32:00.420* :  that involves not just drones,
*32:00.420- 32:02.680* :  not just cruise missiles, but also attacks
*32:02.680- 32:07.040* :  from proxy groups in Houthi, in Yemen,
*32:07.040- 32:08.640* :  which we're getting reports of,
*32:08.760- 32:12.440* :  and also shots fired from Hezbollah and Lebanon.
*32:12.880- 32:15.000* :  It's a significant escalation,
*32:15.020- 32:18.000* :  but if the matter is concluded as far as Iran is concerned,
*32:18.000- 32:22.040* :  then obviously now the ball is in Israel's court.
*32:22.480- 32:25.360* :  Syavash Medi Ardlan from BBC Persian.
*32:28.580- 32:30.000* :  And that's all from us for now,
*32:30.000- 32:31.560* :  but there will be a new edition
*32:31.600- 32:33.360* :  of the Global News Podcast later.
*32:33.920- 32:35.260* :  If you want to comment on this podcast
*32:35.260- 32:37.340* :  or topics covered, you can send us an email.
*32:37.340- 32:41.500* :  The address is globalpodcastatbbc.co.uk.
*32:42.060- 32:45.100* :  You can also find us on X at Global NewsPod.
*32:45.760- 32:47.800* :  This edition was mixed by Nick Randall,
*32:47.800- 32:49.280* :  the producer of Liam McChaeffrey,
*32:49.320- 32:50.760* :  the editor is Karen Martin.
*32:50.920- 32:51.900* :  I'm Janak Jalil.
