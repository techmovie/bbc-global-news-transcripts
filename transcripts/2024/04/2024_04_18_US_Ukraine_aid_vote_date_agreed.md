*01:27.780- 01:31.960* :  And Valerie Sanderson ended the early hours of Thursday the 18th of April. These are our main
*01:31.960- 01:37.360* :  stories. The Republican leader of the House of Representatives names a day for a vote on giving
*01:37.360- 01:42.880* :  more aid to Ukraine. Republican Senator Rich McCormick says the fate of the country is crucial
*01:42.880- 01:48.860* :  partly because of the grain it grows. If Russia controls that 70% of Europe's grain,
*01:49.020- 01:54.940* :  it would be very disruptive to our future. Qatar says it's re-evaluating its role
*01:54.940- 02:01.000* :  mediating between Israel and Hamas more than six months into the devastating conflict in Gaza.
*02:01.340- 02:05.920* :  There are limits to the ability to which we can contribute to these negotiations
*02:06.660- 02:12.860* :  in a constructive manner. The safety of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner planes is under scrutiny,
*02:12.860- 02:19.080* :  adhering to the U.S. Congress. As a whistleblower says the aircraft could break apart midair.
*02:21.180- 02:26.920* :  Also in this podcast a severe drought leads to power cuts in Ecuador and a political reckoning
*02:26.920- 02:33.160* :  there. And 200 million years after becoming extinct, a fossil discovered in southwest England
*02:33.160- 02:38.580* :  sheds new light on a gigantic marine reptile. So we know that these ictus laws become
*02:38.580- 02:42.100* :  truly gigantic right up until their extinction.
*02:46.220- 02:51.500* :  President Zelensky has constantly told the West that many deaths and casualties on and off
*02:51.500- 02:57.340* :  the battlefield in Ukraine's war against Russia could be avoided if allies, especially America,
*02:57.340- 03:05.080* :  gave more military aid. He's been waiting months for a $61 billion aid package from the U.S.,
*03:05.240- 03:08.240* :  which has been blocked by some Republicans in Congress.
*03:09.120- 03:13.680* :  Now, Mike Johnson, the Republican leader of the House of Representatives, says they'll be a vote
*03:13.680- 03:20.040* :  on Saturday. Republican congressman for Georgia Rich McCormick says Ukraine is on the front line
*03:20.040- 03:26.080* :  of preserving security and not only in Europe. Strategically, Ukraine is much more important
*03:26.080- 03:31.720* :  than most people realize that's a top five country and resources. It's got a ton of European
*03:31.720- 03:36.900* :  grain. Obviously, about 70 percent of European grain comes from a Russia controls that 70 percent
*03:36.900- 03:43.060* :  of Europe's grain into the future. They'll be sent on it to Iran and China and North Korea instead
*03:43.060- 03:47.500* :  of European countries or friendly countries. It would be very disruptive to our future.
*03:47.980- 03:53.180* :  Anoth America correspondent, David Willis, told me more about the significance of Saturday's vote.
*03:53.560- 04:00.280* :  It follows weeks of delay during which the situation, of course, in Ukraine, but also in Gaza,
*04:00.660- 04:06.840* :  has grown increasingly desperate. And in an attempt to appease some right-wing members of
*04:06.840- 04:12.600* :  his party who've been feuding over this, the House Speaker, Mike Johnson, who's a Republican,
*04:12.600- 04:19.620* :  has split this $95 billion aid package into a number of separate funding bills,
*04:20.460- 04:27.520* :  one of which would provide another $61 billion in military aid for Ukraine. Another would provide
*04:27.520- 04:34.440* :  a further $26 billion in aid for Israel, including funding for humanitarian assistance for Gaza,
*04:34.940- 04:43.000* :  and another which would provide $8 billion in aid for Taiwan. And in order to sweeten the deal,
*04:43.000- 04:48.640* :  if you like, with his party members, Mike Johnson has also brought forward measures that were
*04:48.640- 04:55.600* :  tightened security along America's southern border with Mexico. Are many people against him on
*04:55.600- 05:03.000* :  this issue? Well, Mike Johnson has declined up to now to bring a Ukraine aid bill vowed to the
*05:03.000- 05:09.780* :  floor of the House for fear of igniting the sort of rebellion amongst right-wingers in his party
*05:09.780- 05:17.700* :  that still threatens to cost him his job. Those right-wing lawmakers are leery about indefinite support
*05:17.700- 05:24.360* :  for Ukraine, and they believe that any such aid should be tied to tighter security measures along
*05:24.360- 05:31.740* :  the U.S. southern border, and now less than six months after he took over from Kevin McCarthy,
*05:31.800- 05:36.840* :  of course, was the first House Speaker in U.S. history to be ousted from the position.
*05:37.440- 05:44.340* :  Mike Johnson's role is very much in jeopardy, with hotliners among them, the Georgia representative
*05:44.380- 05:52.280* :  Marjorie Taylor Greene calling for him to be removed at a time when resignations have shrunk the
*05:52.280- 05:59.920* :  Republican Party's majority in the lower chamber to just one vote. And that has left Mike Johnson
*05:59.920- 06:07.500* :  unable to govern the lower chamber without the support of the Democrats, and his ousting could
*06:07.500- 06:14.060* :  throw the House of Representatives into absolute chaos, of course, when Congress is dealing with a
*06:14.060- 06:21.140* :  number of global crises all at the same time. David Willis. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*06:21.480- 06:27.440* :  has insisted his country will make its own decisions about how to respond to Iran's drone and
*06:27.440- 06:32.480* :  missile attack at the weekend. He was speaking after meeting the British and German foreign
*06:32.480- 06:38.280* :  ministers who both called for restraint. There are fears that retaliation by Israel could trigger
*06:38.280- 06:44.440* :  a regional war in the Middle East. A diplomatic correspondent James Landel reports from Jerusalem.
*06:45.120- 06:49.820* :  Lord Cameron came to Israel as part of an unofficial diplomatic double act with his German
*06:49.820- 06:55.060* :  counterpart, Anna-Lena Bearbock. They met the same leaders, sometimes together, sometimes separately,
*06:55.060- 07:02.000* :  but always with the same message. Israel must act in a way to limit, not expand this conflict.
*07:02.000- 07:06.900* :  There was an acceptance that Israel would retaliate against Iran for the missile attack,
*07:06.900- 07:11.660* :  but it was still worth urging caution. After his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu,
*07:11.660- 07:17.060* :  the foreign secretary said he wanted to show solidarity with Israel, but we don't want to see
*07:17.060- 07:24.080* :  escalation. We hope that anything Israel does is as limited as possible. Lord Cameron also raised
*07:24.080- 07:30.500* :  the situation in Gaza where the humanitarian crisis is still dire, urging Israel to get more
*07:30.500- 07:36.600* :  aid in, even though there were, he said, encouraging signs. He also appealed to Hamas to release
*07:36.600- 07:42.760* :  Israeli hostages and accept what he called a good ceasefire deal. Anna-Lena Bearbock called
*07:42.760- 07:49.120* :  for prudent restraint and said that escalation would serve no one, including Israel's security.
*07:49.120- 07:54.660* :  At a cabinet meeting later, Mr Netanyahu thanked both ministers for their support in the
*07:54.660- 08:02.400* :  defense of Israel, but seemed less keen on their council. They also have all kinds of suggestions
*08:02.400- 08:09.760* :  and advice. I appreciate it, but I want to make it clear we will make our own decisions,
*08:09.820- 08:14.780* :  and the state of Israel will do everything necessary to defend itself.
*08:14.780- 08:20.320* :  Despite this, Israel's government and its Western allies do seem united in wanting to maintain
*08:20.320- 08:24.820* :  the diplomatic support for Israel that emerged in the wake of Iran's attack.
*08:25.680- 08:31.920* :  James Landel. Meanwhile, Qatar has warned that it is in its words re-evaluating its role
*08:31.920- 08:37.880* :  as a mediator between Israel and Hamas. Its prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Al-Bharan Al-Tani
*08:37.880- 08:46.300* :  made the comment at a news conference in Doha. We are committed to our role from a humanitarian
*08:46.300- 08:52.900* :  standpoint, but there are limits to the ability to which we can contribute to these negotiations
*08:53.700- 08:58.000* :  in a constructive manner. And the state of Qatar will take the appropriate decision
*08:58.060- 09:06.120* :  at the appropriate time. Any Qatari decision to abandon its role as a mediator could have
*09:06.120- 09:12.500* :  serious consequences for the currently deadlocked attempts to negotiate a way out of the impasse in Gaza.
*09:13.140- 09:15.480* :  With more details, here's our correspondent, Wara Davis.
*09:16.060- 09:21.960* :  Thus far, Qatar has paid a pivotal role along with Egypt and America in trying to secure a cease
*09:21.960- 09:28.200* :  fire between Israel and Hamas, which would see the release of hostages taken by Hamas in exchange
*09:28.200- 09:34.200* :  for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. It's been a delicate, largely unsuccessful process,
*09:34.200- 09:40.820* :  but the links that Qatar has with all sides, including close ties to Hamas, are regarded as crucial
*09:40.820- 09:46.900* :  to achieving any breakthrough. Qatar is now openly questioning chances of those talks exceeding
*09:47.220- 09:52.620* :  and says it's re-evaluating its role as a mediator. Some critical voices from within the U.S.
*09:52.620- 09:58.040* :  Congress have criticized Qatar for not putting enough pressure on Hamas to make concessions.
*09:58.580- 10:04.440* :  Wara Davis, U.S. Senators have been scrutinizing Boeing's safety record as the
*10:04.440- 10:09.700* :  airplane maker attempts to reassure its customers and investors that they can have confidence in
*10:09.700- 10:16.800* :  the company. Boeing has been in crisis since January. After a panel on one of its 737 Max Plains
*10:16.800- 10:23.220* :  blew out during a flight, no one was injured. Sam Salipore, an engineer and whistle-blower at Boeing,
*10:23.220- 10:27.200* :  has been giving evidence to Senators about the 787 Dreamliner.
*10:27.920- 10:33.620* :  I have analyzed Boeing's own data to conclude that the company has taken manufacturing shortcuts
*10:33.620- 10:41.280* :  on the 787 program that may significantly reduce the airplane safety and the life cycle.
*10:41.680- 10:48.980* :  Since 2013, there have been serious issues on the 787 program, not properly closing thousands
*10:48.980- 10:54.560* :  of gaps in its assembly of the fuselage on major joints. Effectively, they are putting out
*10:54.560- 11:02.040* :  defective airplanes. But Boeing has dismissed these claims as unfounded, saying the 787 has safely
*11:02.040- 11:06.980* :  taken more than four million flights and has met the approval of U.S. regulations.
*11:07.740- 11:11.720* :  An author America business correspondent Michelle Florey told me more about the Senate hearings
*11:11.720- 11:17.460* :  in Washington. This is very much about Boeing's safety culture being under the spotlight after a
*11:17.460- 11:23.000* :  number of incidents, including most recently the Alaska Airlines plane, where a door flew off the
*11:23.040- 11:27.180* :  side. And today we heard from whistle-blowers and it wasn't just one, there were several of them
*11:27.580- 11:32.120* :  which made it all the more powerful, giving their account. One of them you just referred to was
*11:32.120- 11:38.740* :  Sam Salipore. He is a Boeing engineer-turned whistle-blower who said that they were putting out
*11:38.740- 11:44.080* :  defective planes and expressed his concerns about the 787 Dreamliner planes that there were
*11:44.080- 11:50.620* :  shortcuts being taken to try and deal with production bottlenecks. And that's what made him raise
*11:50.620- 11:56.040* :  concerns that the planes could fall out of the air. In response, he said he had faced retaliation
*11:56.100- 12:01.940* :  and harassment. We also heard from another whistle-blower Ed Pearson who talked about this being a
*12:02.120- 12:09.300* :  criminal cover-up and said that Boeing had illegally stopped conducting quality control inspections.
*12:09.300- 12:13.580* :  Boeing has said it takes safety very seriously that there is nothing wrong with its jets,
*12:13.580- 12:18.440* :  but clearly the spotlight was on them today. And we heard on one of the committees,
*12:18.440- 12:24.060* :  them saying that the CEO David Calhoun would be expected to testify certainly in the future.
*12:25.080- 12:29.820* :  And what could the impact of these hearings be, do you think, because it's strong stuff, isn't it?
*12:30.120- 12:33.200* :  It is. I mean, there's a couple of things to remember here. There are only two
*12:33.440- 12:38.100* :  major planemakers in the world. Boeing is one of them Airbus is the other and they have full
*12:38.100- 12:42.120* :  order books. So if you're an airplane maker right now, you don't really have much choice in terms
*12:42.120- 12:49.100* :  of where you can go to to get more planes. But Boeing is an American industrial icon and its reputation
*12:49.100- 12:54.400* :  right now is severely damaged. What we're seeing is lawmakers essentially doing their jobs,
*12:54.400- 13:00.120* :  holding them to account. And this could pose risk to defense contracts down the line and lead to
*13:00.120- 13:05.840* :  more stringent government oversight. Michel Flurry. Now, when you think of huge dinosaurs,
*13:05.840- 13:11.340* :  you may conjure up images of magnificent and sometimes terrifying creatures that once
*13:11.340- 13:16.260* :  roamed the earth. But there were some equally impressive sea creatures too, including one
*13:16.260- 13:22.140* :  called the Icthiosaur, which looked a bit like a cross between Adolfan and Whale. Now, 200
*13:22.140- 13:27.460* :  million years after they became extinct, a fossil of a jawbone measuring more than two meters
*13:27.460- 13:33.620* :  has been found on the coast of southwest England. Scientists believe, based on the size of the jawbone,
*13:33.620- 13:39.960* :  the whole animal was 25 meters long. That's bigger than previously thought. My science reporter,
*13:39.960- 13:44.940* :  Jernina Ranard, told me more about this discovery. We're actually talking about two different
*13:44.940- 13:50.240* :  groups of fossils, which were found by these amateur fossil hunters in the UK. They found them
*13:50.240- 13:54.280* :  when they were digging around in the mud on the beach. And they're fossilised jaw bones. I saw
*13:54.280- 13:59.320* :  the pieces earlier today. They were found over a number of years and now scientists have analysed
*13:59.320- 14:05.420* :  specimens and they concluded they were from this marine reptile, the gigantic Icthiosaur. And when
*14:05.420- 14:10.680* :  you compare those jaw bones to other marine reptiles, so maybe the size of orcas or dolphins that we
*14:10.680- 14:16.140* :  might know, it's absolutely massive. And scientists use that to estimate just how big its body was.
*14:16.840- 14:21.560* :  And to find out more about this, I was speaking to a paleontologist, Dean Lomax at the University
*14:21.560- 14:27.100* :  of Bristol. This discovery is usually important because not only do we now have two of these giant
*14:27.100- 14:32.960* :  jaw bones, we could now work out that they belong to this ancient giant Icthiosaur that we've
*14:32.960- 14:40.200* :  called Icthiotiton 7nces. This animal lived about 202 million years ago right before this
*14:40.200- 14:45.560* :  major extinction event that wiped out this group of animals. So we know that these Icthiotors
*14:45.560- 14:51.440* :  become truly gigantic right up until their extinction. Georgina briefly, you've been speaking to
*14:51.440- 14:55.400* :  the fossil finders, do they think they're going to find more? Well they hope so and partly because
*14:55.400- 14:59.500* :  that would actually help them narrow down just how big it was. They think it's the largest ever,
*14:59.500- 15:04.560* :  but what they really want is a complete skull or skeleton. They told me it is really rare to find
*15:04.560- 15:09.900* :  these things, but anyone can do it and this discovery is testimony to the power of these amateur
*15:09.900- 15:14.940* :  fossil hunters who spend all their time digging around in the mud on beaches or in quarries and
*15:14.940- 15:21.520* :  managed to find these types of amazing fossils. Georgina Renard, the British actor Hugh Grant says he's
*15:21.520- 15:27.240* :  reluctantly settled a lawsuit against the publisher of the Sun newspaper. The film star had accused
*15:27.240- 15:32.940* :  the paper of unlawful gathering of information and his case was being heard with other high profile
*15:32.940- 15:38.520* :  claimants, including Prince Harry. Nikki Schiller reports. Hugh Grant was suing news group
*15:38.520- 15:43.120* :  newspapers, the publishers of the Sun. Claiming journalists had used private investigators
*15:43.120- 15:48.600* :  to tap his phone and burgle his house. It had been expected he would have his timing caught in
*15:48.600- 15:54.680* :  January next year, but now he's unexpectedly settled out of court. The actor best known for
*15:54.680- 15:59.960* :  films such as Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Love Actually said he did not want to
*15:59.960- 16:04.660* :  accept what he called the enormous sum of money he'd been offered, but that continuing to
*16:04.660- 16:10.760* :  find the case, risk making him liable for substantial legal costs, approaching 12 and a half
*16:10.760- 16:16.900* :  million dollars, even if he won. News group newspapers has always denied the claims and said the
*16:16.900- 16:22.800* :  undisclosed settlement with Mr Grant was reached without admission of liability as it was in both
*16:22.800- 16:29.360* :  party's financial interests not to progress to a costly trial. The legal commentator Joshua Rosenberg
*16:29.360- 16:35.200* :  says it's hard to predict how much a case will cost. If you have unlimited funds and
*16:35.200- 16:40.660* :  which of us has, clearly not even Hugh Grant, well then you can afford to take on a corporation.
*16:41.280- 16:47.660* :  That's the sort of thing Prince Harry has done, but most of us can't afford the risk, particularly
*16:47.660- 16:53.040* :  if the other side is going to rack up costs. News group newspapers has rejected allegations of any
*16:53.040- 16:58.420* :  wrongdoing by staff at the Sun and has settled hundreds of cases without making any admission
*16:58.420- 17:04.060* :  of liability. Ribbon Murdoch's UK publishing companies, which included the now defunct news of
*17:04.060- 17:10.360* :  the world, are reported to have paid out more than $1.2 billion in settlements and legal fees.
*17:11.200- 17:15.720* :  Hugh Grant, who has been a prominent campaigner on press reform, says he will use his settlement
*17:15.720- 17:21.240* :  money to boost groups such as Hacked Off, which campaigns for a free and accountable press.
*17:28.920- 17:34.480* :  Tell me everything, it's go back. We're talking the government's will-debise wife at fat
*17:34.480- 17:42.540* :  and called Harris. American author Truman Capote's relationships with high society,
*17:42.540- 17:49.060* :  female friends is featured in a new Disney drama. We're here from the actor in the lead role.
*17:57.500- 18:03.680* :  It's been a year since conflict in Sudan broke out, leaving around 8 million people internally
*18:03.680- 18:08.940* :  displaced, and causing at least another 2 million to flee the country. Along with the violence,
*18:08.940- 18:14.820* :  the great danger is food insecurity, and with farming disrupted, there is a real potential for
*18:14.820- 18:20.240* :  that to lead to famine on a mass scale. Michael Dunford is the world food program's regional
*18:20.240- 18:25.220* :  director for Eastern Africa, and he described the scale of the problem to Rebecca Kesby.
*18:25.720- 18:32.160* :  So the situation in Sudan today is a catastrophe. Our fear is going to continue to deteriorate.
*18:32.320- 18:38.940* :  There are 18 million people who are acutely hungry, five million of those in emergency levels
*18:39.560- 18:45.260* :  of hunger. So the world food program and others are desperately trying to scale our operations to
*18:45.260- 18:51.040* :  meet the needs, but because of the insecurity, because of the complexity of the environment,
*18:51.040- 18:57.460* :  we are simply not reaching all of the people who need our support. We need to have a ceasefire.
*18:57.560- 19:03.160* :  We need to be able to reach the populations where they are. You've mentioned already 8 million
*19:03.160- 19:09.060* :  people who internally displaced inside Sudan. There's another 2 million who have crossed international
*19:09.120- 19:15.940* :  borders into places like Chad and South Sudan. So it's a combination of factors. I don't know
*19:15.940- 19:21.620* :  whether it's been possible for your teams on the ground to work in any way with the two warring
*19:21.620- 19:27.600* :  factions and what the risks of that might be in terms of the aid, but also whether that might
*19:27.620- 19:32.380* :  help and whether they'd be interested in helping to distribute aid to civilians. This is something
*19:32.380- 19:39.240* :  that often is lost. There are so many stakeholders, so many actors in this conflict. When we try
*19:39.240- 19:46.100* :  and organize convoys, we have to negotiate each and every time we move into new territories
*19:46.100- 19:51.980* :  controlled by different actors. This slows down the process enormously. We did a convoy recently
*19:51.980- 19:57.980* :  from Port Sudan into northern Darfur. It took us over three weeks because of the number of times
*19:57.980- 20:04.720* :  we needed to stop and negotiate. The world food program is involved in many different areas in
*20:04.720- 20:11.780* :  the world and a staggering 160 million people have been receiving aid from your organization
*20:11.780- 20:18.020* :  in the past couple of years. Is that sustainable? At the moment, it probably is not. The needs
*20:18.060- 20:23.560* :  particularly post-COVID, but now because of the various conflicts, and it's not just Sudan,
*20:23.560- 20:29.900* :  but it's Gaza, it's Ukraine, it's Yemen and others, we're having to prioritize who we do support,
*20:29.900- 20:36.500* :  who we don't support. I'm very concerned about what the future holds because in Sudan and many of
*20:36.500- 20:41.100* :  these other countries, the situation is deteriorating, we are seeing increased levels of
*20:41.100- 20:49.400* :  malnutrition and ultimately we will see even more severe outcomes unless WFP and others are able
*20:49.400- 20:56.000* :  to meet those needs. Michael Dunford from the World Food Programme speaking to Rebecca Kesby.
*20:56.880- 21:01.780* :  A severe drought has led to power cuts in Ecuador, which relies on hydro-electrical sources
*21:02.220- 21:07.300* :  for much of its electricity. The capital, Keto and other major cities have already suffered
*21:07.300- 21:13.240* :  hours without power. Now the crisis has sparked a political reckoning with the president over
*21:13.240- 21:18.800* :  ruling and then replacing his energy minister. I got more from our Latin America online reporter
*21:18.800- 21:24.940* :  Vanessa Bushletter. So Ecuador as well as neighboring Colombia have been experience a severe
*21:24.940- 21:30.480* :  drought, which has been linked to the inenial weather phenomenon. So there has been a lack of
*21:30.480- 21:37.920* :  rain and both countries get most of the energy from hydroelectric power and you need a certain water
*21:37.920- 21:43.520* :  level to work those hydroelectric power plants. So when those water levels drop, those plants don't
*21:43.520- 21:48.920* :  work, you don't get energy and then you have to think about rationing energy, which is what Ecuador
*21:49.180- 21:54.940* :  decided to do. And there have been power cuts in some of the major cities for up to five or
*21:54.940- 22:01.940* :  six hours in a country which has seen security really plummet. So you can imagine how worried people
*22:01.940- 22:07.560* :  where when the power went out in these large cities. And this has led to a political reckoning,
*22:07.560- 22:14.160* :  hasn't it? It has because the way this came about was a little bit chaotic. On Friday the
*22:14.160- 22:19.920* :  energy minister insisted that there wouldn't be a rationing of energy, that there wouldn't be power cuts.
*22:20.540- 22:26.100* :  Speed forward to the weekend and suddenly people were left without power, without any warning.
*22:26.100- 22:33.580* :  And so on Monday the energy ministry had to do about face and say that they were going to ration
*22:33.640- 22:39.020* :  energy, but they said they would adhere to a schedule. So to allow people to prepare for the power
*22:39.020- 22:44.280* :  cuts, which of course is very important because businesses need to prepare, say for example,
*22:44.280- 22:48.760* :  you've got a food business, you want to know beforehand when you will not have power so that you
*22:48.760- 22:54.820* :  can prepare food and they announced this, but then the president came out and retracted that and
*22:54.820- 23:00.420* :  said there would not be power cuts in this week. So Ecuadorians have been giving these conflicting
*23:00.420- 23:06.100* :  bits of information and you can understand why they would be pretty fed up. And also I suppose the
*23:06.100- 23:11.900* :  question is how does the president know that they won't be necessary the power cuts? Exactly and
*23:11.900- 23:18.000* :  the energy companies seem to have plowed ahead with further rationing because there's a shortage
*23:18.000- 23:23.480* :  and there's no other way to combat that shortage. So until it rains there's very little that these
*23:23.480- 23:29.100* :  energy companies can do. The situation in Ecuador has been further exacerbated by the fact that
*23:29.100- 23:34.880* :  normally Ecuador imports power from neighbouring Colombia, but because Colombia has also got a drought
*23:34.880- 23:40.300* :  and has experienced the same problems, they've said they will prioritize their own consumers and
*23:40.300- 23:46.820* :  will stop temporarily exporting their power to Ecuador. Vanessa Bushlitter, the authorities in the
*23:46.820- 23:52.520* :  United Arab Emirates have denied reports that widespread floods in the country are the results of a
*23:52.520- 23:59.020* :  weather modification process known as cloud seeding. More than a year's worth of rain fell in just
*23:59.020- 24:05.860* :  24 hours. Thousands of passengers are stranded at Dubai International Airport after their flights
*24:05.860- 24:09.980* :  were cancelled or delayed. Graham Satchel has been following the story.
*24:12.020- 24:15.620* :  The storm in Dubai and across the whole region was extraordinary,
*24:15.620- 24:20.360* :  that left cars submerged and abandoned, planes taxing through flooded runways,
*24:20.900- 24:26.860* :  and emergency services in boats here rescuing a cat clinging to a car door for dear life.
*24:29.900- 24:35.120* :  The United Arab Emirates is one of the driest regions in the world, so how could so much rain fall
*24:35.120- 24:41.720* :  in such an arid area? For more than 20 years the UAE has been using a process called cloud seeding.
*24:42.060- 24:46.320* :  Teams of pilots fly into the clouds and spray salt particles to encourage
*24:46.320- 24:52.720* :  more water to form. The UAE flies more than 300 missions a year. Is cloud seeding to blame
*24:52.720- 24:57.920* :  for worsening the floods? Professor Martin Ambaum, a meteorologist at University of Redding
*24:58.320- 25:03.340* :  is skeptical. It has nothing to do with this particular weather event. It was very well
*25:03.340- 25:08.700* :  predicted several days in advance. The National Meteorological Center in the Emirates will not
*25:08.700- 25:14.620* :  have gone out to do seeding in that particular system. And even if they had the scale of this
*25:14.620- 25:19.520* :  weather system was so large that cloud seeding operations would not have had any effect on it.
*25:19.980- 25:24.600* :  Meteorologists say climate change is likely to be the main reason for the severity of the storm,
*25:24.600- 25:30.680* :  but the cause of the excessive flooding may be more banal. Dubai is a city of concrete and glass.
*25:30.680- 25:36.120* :  It's expanded rapidly in the last few decades and has little infrastructure like storm drains
*25:36.120- 25:41.480* :  that could help it deal with the sudden influx of water. So while the finger of blame is being
*25:41.480- 25:47.980* :  pointed by some at what may appear to be slightly scary sci-fi technology, poor town planning
*25:47.980- 25:54.520* :  may be the more prosaic reason the streets of Dubai are still flooded. Graham Satchel,
*25:55.120- 26:00.580* :  from his chaining true crime book In Cold Blood to his novella, breakfast at Tiffany's,
*26:00.860- 26:06.800* :  the American author Truman Capote has been celebrated for his writing style. He was obsessed with
*26:06.800- 26:12.820* :  high society and his depiction of his wealthy female friends and the scandalous revelations of
*26:12.820- 26:17.700* :  their closest kept secrets are at the heart of a new Disney plus TV drama called
*26:17.700- 26:28.140* :  feud Capote versus the swans. Truman, tell me everything. Here's the fact even your sister will
*26:28.180- 26:33.560* :  steal your men. I don't know what matters more than the sex or you're knowing about it.
*26:34.360- 26:39.960* :  Wait, go back. We're talking the governor's wildest wife. That fat and cold hair.
*26:39.960- 26:40.320* :  Yes.
*26:40.540- 26:42.580* :  Good luck, good luck, good luck.
*26:42.640- 26:44.980* :  Only you can show us these wild trolling.
*26:44.980- 26:45.840* :  Oh no, good.
*26:46.100- 26:47.000* :  How you really are?
*26:47.140- 26:48.060* :  You're looking awesome.
*26:48.440- 26:53.620* :  Well, the man who plays Truman Capote is the British actor Tom Hollander from hits like
*26:53.620- 26:57.360* :  The Night Manager and The White Lotus. He's booked a Martha Carney.
*26:57.600- 27:02.920* :  It's definitely the part of a large time. I did love playing it. He's a very complex
*27:03.580- 27:10.240* :  and very brilliant character and he's tragic and there's a descending arc in which he
*27:10.900- 27:14.200* :  destroys himself. All the things that actors love to play.
*27:14.200- 27:17.840* :  So it was a big moment for me to get that part.
*27:18.080- 27:23.960* :  And as you said, tragic time in his life because he'd had all this literary success,
*27:23.960- 27:28.940* :  but he was plagued by many problems and he found himself in the midst of high society,
*27:28.940- 27:31.620* :  but it wasn't really his world. It wasn't where he grew up.
*27:31.740- 27:36.800* :  No, it wasn't where he grew up. He was abandoned by his mother when he was about four and she
*27:36.800- 27:42.680* :  tried to enter high society herself, leaving him with an aunt in Monroeville, Alabama.
*27:42.680- 27:48.140* :  And he sort of caught up with her about the age of 10 and was quite interested in high
*27:48.140- 27:53.860* :  society from a very early age himself. He formed relationships with Una Chaplin and people like
*27:53.860- 27:59.660* :  that when he was very young. So he always had the same aspiration himself, which came to a climax
*27:59.740- 28:05.080* :  with his black and white ball in 1966, which we dramatize in the show.
*28:05.400- 28:11.160* :  His mother's progress had ended up tragically. She'd nearly made it in the uppery side and then
*28:11.160- 28:16.220* :  Joe Capote, her husband, turned up to be a sort of fraud and she killed herself.
*28:16.220- 28:24.100* :  And in our show, the black and white ball is dramatized as Truman's revenge on behalf of his mother.
*28:24.100- 28:33.100* :  It's his gift to her mom. You didn't make it, but I did look at me now. It's that he wrote a satire
*28:33.100- 28:39.680* :  about a bunch of ladies in a restaurant. They were thinly veiled versions of his real life friends.
*28:40.280- 28:46.260* :  And it was quite obvious. We're certainly within their circle who he was talking about. And he satirized
*28:46.260- 28:51.740* :  them rather brutally. He didn't draw them with the compassion that he drew his more famous characters,
*28:51.740- 28:58.860* :  Hollywood, or Dick and Perry, in cold blood. It's rather cruel and they were very hurt and they
*28:58.860- 29:04.900* :  sort of canceled him and ostracized him. And so he lost this connection to these fancy people
*29:05.120- 29:11.340* :  that meant so much to him. He was an addictive personality and addicted to booze, but also
*29:11.340- 29:17.240* :  addicted to sort of fancy people, I think. And he should have been at his desk writing
*29:17.240- 29:22.660* :  great literature. Anyway, when they canceled him, Ryan Murphy, Gus Van Sance, John Robbie Bates,
*29:22.660- 29:29.220* :  just to give the creative people some credit. In their version, he goes on a slow descent to self-destruction
*29:29.600- 29:35.400* :  and gives in to booze and drugs and all the rest of it and died age 59.
*29:36.420- 29:43.320* :  The actor Tom Hollander. Since the dawn of recorded music, artists have incorporated the signs of
*29:43.320- 29:49.720* :  nature into their songs. Think of the chirping wildlife in the Beatles Blackbird or the outdoor
*29:49.720- 29:56.240* :  acoustics of Neil Young's natural beauty. Now, from Thursday, artists who illustrate their work
*29:56.240- 30:01.300* :  with nature will be able to automatically split their profits with the environmental causes
*30:01.780- 30:05.520* :  through a project called Sounds Right, which is supported by the UN.
*30:06.280- 30:10.660* :  Our music correspondent Mark Savage has been speaking to two of the artists taking part,
*30:10.660- 30:15.560* :  Roxy Music co-founder Brian Enoe and the Norwegian pop artist Aurora.
*30:21.660- 30:28.060* :  It's an unusual duet. David Bowie singing with wild pigs, bees and hyenas.
*30:30.860- 30:36.340* :  His co-writer Brian Enoe has remixed the track as part of an environmental campaign.
*30:39.440- 30:45.440* :  This project is a way of saying to artists, look, we all use the sounds of nature a lot in what
*30:45.440- 30:52.560* :  we do. Seagulls and waves and wind and why don't we pay nature a royalty for that? Then redirect
*30:52.640- 30:57.500* :  that money towards people who are helping save the world, actually save the planet.
*30:59.840- 31:05.040* :  Backed by the United Nations, the project will also see ambient signs from the rainforest and
*31:05.040- 31:11.620* :  the ocean monetized on streaming services. But music is the key. What I think music can do is to
*31:11.620- 31:17.300* :  give you feelings. And if you can say to people, can you imagine a better world? Here's what
*31:17.300- 31:22.120* :  it would sound like. That gives people a set of feelings about how life could be, how else
*31:22.120- 31:27.760* :  things could be. Artists who have contributed to the first wave of releases include Ellie Golden
*31:27.760- 31:34.520* :  and the Norwegian pop star Aurora, who's mixed the sound of her homelands forests into the song
*31:34.540- 31:41.900* :  a soul with no king. The beautiful thing about art and artists is that we do manage to speak to
*31:41.900- 31:49.200* :  people in a way that doesn't feel like being preached to and has a very good chance of making
*31:49.200- 31:52.360* :  contact with nature as seen, desirable again.
*32:00.820- 32:06.580* :  The project could easily be dismissed as a gimmick. But Brian Eno, who after all pioneered
*32:06.580- 32:11.940* :  ambient music, says turning to nature gives him new colors to paint with. It's such a thrill working
*32:11.940- 32:17.340* :  with natural sounds, their wild elements. And you have to make a decision about whether you are
*32:17.340- 32:21.740* :  going to try to make them sound more like instruments. Or whether you're going to let them be
*32:21.740- 32:27.000* :  what they are and to cool the music somewhere else. Yes, on the David Bowie track that you've
*32:27.000- 32:31.540* :  remixed, get real. It sounds like the hyenas and the wild pigs that are in there are almost
*32:31.680- 32:35.240* :  musical collaborators. They're responding to the energy of the music.
*32:39.380- 32:41.860* :  Yes, they sound quite angry, don't they? Yes.
*32:44.340- 32:46.600* :  Do you think music has the power to change?
*32:47.120- 32:52.140* :  The strength in music is that it's easier for people to agree on because it's wrapped in beauty
*32:52.940- 32:56.820* :  and no change will ever happen unless people stand together.
*32:57.360- 33:02.780* :  Most politics and most media gain their energy from finding things that separate people
*33:02.780- 33:08.100* :  and social media particularly as this. It's very important that there should be ways that we can
*33:08.100- 33:13.600* :  communicate that make us feel that it's worth cooperating rather than fighting. What gives me hope
*33:13.600- 33:18.480* :  is we're having conversations like this and lots of people are having conversations like this.
*33:18.680- 33:24.920* :  It gives me a lot of hope to see that for the kids the conversation around the environment is so
*33:24.920- 33:30.320* :  obvious they're already strongly opinionated. And the last thing I would say that really
*33:30.320- 33:35.460* :  encourages me is that old people like me are dying. The people who run the fossil fuel companies,
*33:35.960- 33:41.380* :  the people who pay advertising companies to tell lies about what is really happening now.
*33:41.600- 33:44.480* :  I don't think they have a platform in the future. So here's to death.
*33:46.540- 33:50.000* :  Let's make a new world together, Brian. I was hoping you would ask.
*33:53.500- 33:57.580* :  Brian Eno and Aurora ending that report by Mark Savage.
*33:59.080- 34:02.980* :  And that's it from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*34:02.980- 34:07.000* :  This edition was mixed by Alicia Thirsting. The producer was Emma Joseph.
