*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news 7 days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:20.260* :  by advertising. People fixing the world is the podcast looking for solutions to the problems
*00:20.260- 00:25.240* :  we face today. It could potentially ease the suffering of millions. We have a solution.
*00:26.540- 00:29.600* :  People fixing the world from the BBC World Service.
*00:37.500- 00:43.560* :  I'm Rachel Wright and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday the 16th of April, these are our main stories.
*00:44.280- 00:48.300* :  Mounting uncertainty in the Middle East as Israel considers how to respond,
*00:48.300- 00:54.260* :  it runs attack over the weekend. A tragedy in Copenhagen as one of its iconic buildings
*00:54.260- 01:00.020* :  burns down. South Korea is marking the 10th anniversary of the seawall ferry disaster,
*01:00.640- 01:03.760* :  which killed over 300 people most of them children.
*01:06.880- 01:12.080* :  Also in this podcast, a new AI tool that does away with the need for a screen.
*01:12.980- 01:17.340* :  What time is my flight to New York? Your flight to New York is at 1pm.
*01:22.960- 01:27.980* :  We start in the Middle East, where tensions have ratcheted up since Iran's drone attack on
*01:27.980- 01:33.920* :  Israel over the weekend. As we record this podcast, the Israeli war cabinet is in a meeting to
*01:33.920- 01:40.700* :  agree how it will respond, but Western leaders are urging restraint. Meanwhile, Iran is warning that
*01:40.700- 01:46.200* :  if it is attacked by Israel, it will retaliate. Our Middle East correspondent Yolan Nell is in
*01:46.200- 01:52.380* :  Jerusalem. This is the Israeli war cabinet meeting for the third time, three consecutive days.
*01:52.380- 01:58.460* :  It's been having some long deliberations really weighing up the different options available to it.
*01:58.840- 02:04.900* :  Of course, Israel has all different means that it's disposal, asymmetric people talking about
*02:04.900- 02:09.480* :  the StocksNet computer worm that was used to disable a key part of Iran's nuclear program
*02:10.100- 02:17.220* :  in the past. It has conventional means, which it could use to attack in Iran if it wanted to,
*02:17.300- 02:23.700* :  but of course, there's a huge danger here of escalating a regional crisis and bringing about,
*02:23.700- 02:31.200* :  you know, yet more open warfare between these long-time enemies, more violence between Israel and
*02:31.200- 02:38.120* :  an Iran-aligned groups. Well, we know that Western countries are calling for Israel to be restrained
*02:38.120- 02:43.540* :  in their reaction, but what's the mood amongst other nations in the region, the likes of Egypt,
*02:43.540- 02:50.220* :  Jordan and Saudi Arabia? Well, the whole region remains kind of on edge because it could easily get
*02:50.220- 02:57.300* :  sucked into a new sort of spiral of violence. Interestingly, the Jordanian foreign minister has been
*02:57.300- 03:02.680* :  speaking in the past couple of hours, really saying that the international community must stop
*03:02.680- 03:07.600* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from in his words, stealing attention away from Gaza
*03:07.980- 03:13.660* :  by escalating his confrontation with Iran. So that is also how this is being perceived.
*03:14.240- 03:19.280* :  And in fact, does he not have a point? I mean, is anybody internationally talking about the humanitarian
*03:19.280- 03:26.180* :  crisis and the food, the supply of food to Gaza? The Gaza war is raging on, even as it may have
*03:26.180- 03:31.040* :  been eclipsed in the news coverage. I mean, just in the past day, we've got fighting really the
*03:31.040- 03:35.700* :  entire length of the strip. The Israeli armies begun a new military operation in the very north of
*03:35.700- 03:40.520* :  Gaza, whether several schools housing displaced people from what we're hearing from witnesses on
*03:40.520- 03:44.200* :  the ground. There have been airstrikes and shelling before Israeli ground forces entered.
*03:44.920- 03:48.820* :  More intense fighting in the center of Gaza, where the Israeli military says that it's going
*03:48.820- 03:54.200* :  after a target's linked to Hamas. And we know there have been deadly airstrikes in Rafa in
*03:54.200- 03:59.840* :  the very south in the past day or so. The amount of aid now entering Gaza is kind of disputed,
*03:59.920- 04:04.440* :  but UN agencies are really saying that, you know, overall, what's going in still far below
*04:04.440- 04:10.340* :  the bare minimum levels which are required to meet basic needs. Yuland Nell in Jerusalem.
*04:11.280- 04:16.680* :  Memorial services are taking place across South Korea to mark the 10-year anniversary of the
*04:16.680- 04:22.380* :  country's worst ever maritime disaster. More than 300 people, mostly schoolchildren,
*04:22.380- 04:27.760* :  died when the overloaded ferry they were on, capsized and sank while crossing to the holiday
*04:27.760- 04:34.540* :  island of Jeju. Yung Sung Wuk's teenage son died in the incident. He says that he doesn't feel
*04:34.540- 04:42.680* :  enough has been done to hold those responsible to account. Ten years later, I feel even more
*04:42.680- 04:50.400* :  unhappy, even though I've tried so hard. There was no proper punishment and no investigation into
*04:50.400- 04:57.680* :  the truth. We believe things have got worse. The victims have the right to be told why such a
*04:57.680- 05:04.520* :  disaster occurred and how things are progressing. This is something that our country is lacking so far.
*05:07.220- 05:11.500* :  Our Asia-Pacific editor, Mickey Bristol, told me more about what happened.
*05:12.240- 05:18.200* :  Well, this was a series of terrible misjudgments and mistakes and errors on the part of the
*05:18.200- 05:24.300* :  authorities. Firstly, the ship which sang had been refurbished and it was being refurbished
*05:24.300- 05:31.820* :  incorrectly, so it was top heavy. It was overloaded. On the night that it set sail, it had been foggy,
*05:31.820- 05:39.520* :  there was erratic steering which caused the ferry to overturn. The authorities were slow to arrive
*05:39.520- 05:46.060* :  at the scene. Afterwards, the government appeared to want to protect its own image as much as
*05:46.060- 05:52.580* :  gets to the bottom of everything. All this contributed to the great outpouring of both grief and
*05:52.580- 05:58.000* :  anger as we heard. Some of it, they're still real in the hearts of the parents who lost their
*05:58.000- 06:03.420* :  children to find out what went on and really blame the authorities and hold them to account because
*06:03.420- 06:08.920* :  it was a terrible, terrible tragedy. Did everybody on board die or were there some rescued?
*06:09.320- 06:15.360* :  Not everybody on board died. I think there were nearly 500 people on board, but 304 of them died,
*06:15.360- 06:21.400* :  250 of them were school children on a trip and there was some real heartbreaking video which emerged
*06:21.400- 06:25.660* :  at the time of them. They didn't even realise what was going on. One of the big mistakes is the
*06:25.660- 06:30.820* :  captain and some of the senior officers they told the children to stay in their cabins, even
*06:30.820- 06:36.280* :  as water was coming into the ship, even as the captain himself was leaving the ship. He told the
*06:36.280- 06:42.360* :  children to stay and they didn't realise at first what terrible trouble they were in. So all this
*06:42.360- 06:47.780* :  contributed to the great outpouring of grief that we heard a little bit of that there.
*06:48.280- 06:54.200* :  And to a court case and a trial? What happened to the captain of the ferry? Is this helping now?
*06:54.200- 06:59.820* :  Are they taking precautions? Well, certain changes were brought in. The captain, he was given
*06:59.820- 07:05.320* :  life in prison for murder. Some of the other officers were also prosecuted. They're still in prison
*07:05.320- 07:12.360* :  too and things have changed, but it was one of those incidents in the life of a nation. There
*07:12.360- 07:20.580* :  were often these incidents which spur social, political change, which go beyond just an accident.
*07:20.760- 07:25.480* :  And this was one of those. Eventually it led to the downfall of the President Park Gunhae
*07:25.820- 07:30.820* :  because of her rolling, a perceived rolling trying to cover this up. And even now,
*07:31.860- 07:35.760* :  there's still a sense in South Korea that this hasn't been properly counted for a couple of
*07:35.760- 07:42.580* :  years ago. There was a major crush in Seoul on Halloween, 150 odd people died, most of them young
*07:42.580- 07:51.100* :  people and that reminded everyone of this kind of tragedy of the ferry and really left people
*07:51.100- 07:56.700* :  feeling that not the authorities hadn't really taken responsibility, hadn't prosecuted people
*07:56.740- 08:01.780* :  and hadn't really learnt the lessons of what had happened on that night. And briefly, what's
*08:01.780- 08:06.240* :  likely to happen today? What's the mood? What are the memorials? Lots of memorials. Some of the
*08:06.280- 08:09.640* :  parents have been taken out to the site of the sink in. There's going to be another
*08:10.060- 08:15.880* :  so many at the ferry site that was brought up and taken on shore. There are so many there.
*08:16.420- 08:23.520* :  There are film showings, screenings, theatre performances, all kinds of events over the next
*08:23.520- 08:28.800* :  couple of days. This is still a real palpable event for the people in South Korea.
*08:29.840- 08:36.220* :  Mickey Bristol. To Denmark now, where the old stock exchange in Copenhagen has caught fire,
*08:36.780- 08:40.960* :  live video from local media showed people carrying large paintings from the building,
*08:40.960- 08:47.460* :  which was built in 1615, to save them from the flames. It's one of the capital's most famous
*08:47.460- 08:52.620* :  buildings and the headquarters of the country's Chamber of Commerce. A spokesman described the
*08:52.620- 08:58.280* :  scene as a terrible site. Our hard week is a nearby resident. When I stepped out of my apartment
*08:58.280- 09:02.560* :  to go to work and I could see a huge fire across the waterway with people looking very sad and
*09:02.560- 09:06.740* :  very quiet. It's a very central, very historic, very important landmark for the Danish citizens.
*09:06.740- 09:12.300* :  It's a sad day for them. There was renovation work going on in the building, but as yet the authorities
*09:12.300- 09:17.740* :  have not said if they know the cause of the fire, our correspondent Adrian Murray is at the scene.
*09:18.400- 09:23.420* :  It stood around a hundred meters or so away from the historic force and building. Smoke
*09:23.420- 09:30.460* :  continues to bellow from the top. There are fire crews all around the area continuing to work on
*09:30.460- 09:37.200* :  that operation. I can see at least five separate poses continuing to pump water into the building.
*09:37.740- 09:43.900* :  Now this whole area is cordoned off by the police and there's at least a dozen fire engines
*09:43.900- 09:48.460* :  as well as other works vehicles and that operation is really continuing. It got underway
*09:48.460- 09:54.660* :  earlier this morning. It's not clear yet what the cause of the fire was. We do know there
*09:54.660- 10:00.100* :  was renovations taking place on the building. So it was covered with scaffolding and also plastic
*10:00.100- 10:05.840* :  sheeting and it's also a very windy day and all of that is said to have made it quite a difficult
*10:05.840- 10:11.500* :  task for the firefighters to actually put that blaze out. There were people in the building.
*10:11.500- 10:17.840* :  We understand they all managed to safely escape. They were evacuated and police said there were no
*10:17.840- 10:25.480* :  reports of injuries. Of course this is a very historic building. It's 400 years old and some of
*10:25.480- 10:31.740* :  them were trying to salvage and rescue some of the historic artworks and bring those out with them.
*10:31.740- 10:38.340* :  So there will still be an evaluation of what has been saved and what has been destroyed by the blaze.
*10:38.620- 10:46.460* :  It's really a sad day because this is a building of huge cultural value and heritage to this city.
*10:46.820- 10:51.800* :  It's very much a picture postcard building with those four dragons going up for
*10:51.800- 10:56.800* :  fire and people watched on with disbelief when that collapsed earlier and now you can just see
*10:56.800- 11:03.300* :  some of the skeletal remains building but it's really a very sad day for the city and an iconic
*11:03.300- 11:08.940* :  building has been lost somewhere to describe it as Copenhagen's knock you down.
*11:10.120- 11:16.040* :  Adrian Murray in Copenhagen is being held as a possible successor to our smartphones
*11:16.060- 11:22.260* :  the device known as the pin uses artificial intelligence to provide us with information without
*11:22.260- 11:28.620* :  the need for a screen. Bethany Bonjourno is one of the co-founders of Humane who makes the pin.
*11:29.220- 11:34.760* :  AI pin is the first multimodal device that's wearable and easy to use. It's also incredibly personal
*11:34.760- 11:40.060* :  which means the more I tell my pin over time the better assistant it will be to me and it also does
*11:40.060- 11:45.220* :  this without having to download or manage an application. I'm going to start by asking my pin about
*11:45.220- 11:50.980* :  something I asked it to remember for me. What time is my flight to New York? You can ask your
*11:50.980- 11:56.980* :  pins remember your schedule, make lists, take notes, really anything. Your flight to New York is at
*11:56.980- 12:02.560* :  1pm. Well I heard more about the device from our technology editor Zoe Kleinman.
*12:03.160- 12:07.280* :  If you're a fan of Star Trek it might look a little bit familiar to you. It's kind of a little
*12:07.280- 12:11.940* :  bit like the communicator that they wore. You wear it like a brooch it's a sort of small oblong
*12:11.940- 12:17.160* :  shaped device. Let's start with what's interesting about it and what's good about it Zoe.
*12:17.580- 12:23.480* :  It is a really clever idea. It is this concept of a sort of portable AI assistant that you can
*12:23.480- 12:28.400* :  ask things to throughout your day. It doesn't have a screen so you don't get distracted. You know
*12:28.400- 12:32.280* :  how many times you pull your phone out and you end up spending 10 minutes on it and actually you've
*12:32.280- 12:35.720* :  completely forgotten what you're going to do in the first place. It's not like that because there
*12:35.720- 12:40.040* :  isn't so much to do on it. Ultimately that's also it's downfall but we'll get to that in a minute.
*12:40.360- 12:45.600* :  So the idea is you can ask it questions and it will answer them. It has a camera it can share
*12:45.600- 12:50.140* :  your world around you if you like. It is attached to a phone number but not your phone number.
*12:50.140- 12:54.340* :  It's a completely separate device so you can send messages and communicate with other people
*12:54.900- 12:58.920* :  and of course we are all looking at you know what is going to replace this smartphone one day
*12:58.920- 13:04.500* :  something will and this is an idea that a lot of people have invested in this company humane has
*13:04.500- 13:08.420* :  had over two hundred and fourteen million dollars worth of investment. Last year it was valued
*13:08.420- 13:13.080* :  at about nine hundred million dollars. It's been created by two people who've come from Apple
*13:13.080- 13:17.820* :  so it had a really solid base. There was a lot of hype around it when it was unveiled earlier
*13:17.820- 13:23.680* :  this year. However the reviews have come in and they are bad and what is bad about it is that it
*13:23.740- 13:28.040* :  just doesn't work well enough. You ask it a question and there's a delay because nothing is
*13:28.040- 13:33.940* :  processing on it. It has to send this request to the cloud to computer networks elsewhere and
*13:33.940- 13:37.560* :  then get the response back to you and that will depends of course on how good your signal is.
*13:37.600- 13:42.700* :  So there are lots of frustrations with it and also we know that AI assistants if you've ever
*13:42.700- 13:47.760* :  used something like chat GPT they hallucinate right so sometimes you might wait 10 seconds for your
*13:47.760- 13:52.600* :  answer and then it's the wrong answer. And are we going to be seeing people wandering around on
*13:52.600- 13:56.920* :  trains or whatever just talking to themselves? I mean isn't there enough of a problem with people
*13:56.920- 14:02.500* :  talking at smartphones now? I think possibly less so after the reviews that have come in one man
*14:02.500- 14:07.040* :  called Marcus Brownlee who is possibly the biggest gadget reviewer on the internet he's got millions
*14:07.040- 14:11.240* :  and millions of followers. He says it's the worst product he's reviewed so far. So I think after
*14:11.240- 14:15.880* :  a review like that it's going to struggle to carry on in its current form as a mass market device.
*14:16.560- 14:20.860* :  I mean yes we see people talking on the phones we are kind of used to that. This doesn't listen
*14:20.860- 14:24.860* :  for a wake word it's not like an assistant where you have to say it's name to wake it up you just
*14:24.860- 14:30.320* :  touch it to start talking to it. I should say actually it does also have a very interesting display
*14:30.320- 14:36.360* :  idea you can hold your hand up and it will project a display onto your hand and this sort of green
*14:36.360- 14:42.460* :  light which if you maneuver your gestures well enough you can do some basic control with your hands
*14:42.500- 14:47.640* :  as well. But yeah I'm not convinced that in its current form it's going to make but it is an
*14:47.640- 14:54.440* :  interesting idea. Zoe Kleinman the flame lighting ceremony for the Paris Olympics has taken place
*14:54.840- 15:00.520* :  in the ancient town of Olympia and southwest Greece hundreds of dignitaries gathered in the ruins
*15:00.520- 15:06.140* :  of the temple here where actresses dressed as ancient priestesses perform the ritual of the
*15:14.380- 15:21.920* :  lighting of the flame. The flame was then handed over to the first of hundreds of torch
*15:21.920- 15:27.640* :  bearers who will carry it in relay across Greece. Speaking at the ceremony the president of the
*15:27.640- 15:32.820* :  International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach said the light was a desperately needed powerful
*15:32.820- 15:38.680* :  symbol. In these difficult times we are living through with wars and conflicts on the rise
*15:39.600- 15:48.640* :  people are fed up with all the hate the aggression the negative news they are facing day in day
*15:48.640- 15:57.600* :  out in their hearts and I think in all our hearts we are longing for something that brings us
*15:57.900- 16:06.100* :  together we are longing for something that is unifying us we are longing for something that
*16:06.100- 16:14.940* :  gives us hope the Olympic flame that we are lighting today is the symbol of hope.
*16:15.980- 16:21.560* :  In 11 days time the flame will be handed over to the games organizers who will take it to France.
*16:25.100- 16:29.060* :  Coming up on this podcast why Parisians prefer pedal power.
*16:30.460- 16:35.920* :  Okay here we go I am cycling onto the couples of the Charles Ilyseis much like the
*16:35.920- 16:41.100* :  the Tour de France concrete divider separating us from the cars and the other traffic.

*17:45.140- 17:50.220* :  We have a solution let's do it. Listen now wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:59.220- 18:04.000* :  The Head of the UN's Nuclear Watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency,
*18:04.000- 18:09.880* :  has warned that the plant is dangerously close to suffering an accident because of recent attacks
*18:09.880- 18:16.120* :  on it. Raphael Grossy was addressing the UN Security Council in New York. The largest
*18:16.120- 18:22.360* :  nuclear power facility in Europe, Zabarisha has been occupied by Russian forces since shortly
*18:22.360- 18:28.120* :  after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. After his speech Mr. Grossy spoke to the BBC.
*18:28.980- 18:37.020* :  When you are attacking a nuclear power plant as it happened on April 7 with number of drones
*18:37.020- 18:44.540* :  targeting the roof of a nuclear reactor and other places then you cannot exclude this
*18:44.540- 18:50.940* :  car the possibility that something can happen targeting a nuclear facility is playing with fire
*18:51.560- 18:59.700* :  should never happen is irresponsible and we are saying so drones while small are ubiquitous
*19:00.000- 19:07.740* :  and can carry significant amounts of explosives and therefore could be aimed at very specific
*19:07.740- 19:15.340* :  areas. You remember that this facility is very big one and apart from the reactor's proper
*19:15.980- 19:26.600* :  you have spent fuel storage areas in water or dry. You have areas where fresh fuel is in storage.
*19:26.620- 19:35.980* :  You have many places which could potentially be targeted. My fear is that we are still under the
*19:35.980- 19:43.840* :  danger of direct attacks which I thought would not be happening again. So this is not a scenario.
*19:43.840- 19:51.020* :  This is not a hypothetical situation. This is a reality now. So what's next? This is my question.
*19:51.020- 19:58.100* :  This is why it is so important for the IAA to draw an alarm to come here to the Security Council
*19:58.660- 20:06.340* :  to inform widely about the situation and to call for at most restraints.
*20:09.060- 20:14.660* :  At least 39 people have been killed in Pakistan. Several of them struck by lightning as heavy
*20:14.660- 20:19.500* :  rain swept across the country's southwest. Caroline Davis reports from Islamabad.
*20:20.120- 20:25.100* :  The heavy rain has battered houses, roads, mountain sides and rural plains across Pakistan.
*20:25.780- 20:30.360* :  Four members of one family including a baby who were sheltering from the downpour in their home
*20:30.360- 20:36.080* :  in the northern province of KP died when the roof collapsed. Incined in the south at least four
*20:36.080- 20:41.200* :  people were killed in road traffic accidents linked to flooded roads. While in Punjab, Pakistan's
*20:41.200- 20:46.380* :  largest province more than 20 were killed when struck by lightning during storms. More rain is
*20:46.380- 20:53.000* :  forecast for the coming days. Caroline Davis. Here in the UK MPs will today debate legislation
*20:53.000- 20:59.560* :  that would give Britain some of the toughest anti-tabacco laws in the world. It would mean anyone turning
*20:59.560- 21:06.220* :  15 this year or younger would never legally be allowed to buy cigarettes. New Zealand had planned
*21:06.220- 21:11.360* :  something similar but the country's new coalition government scrapped the policy. The chief
*21:11.360- 21:17.080* :  medical officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, says phasing out smoking would be a huge
*21:17.080- 21:22.840* :  public health achievement. The great majority of smokers wish they never started but they become
*21:22.840- 21:27.680* :  addicted at an early age and then they're trapped and their choice has been taken away by that
*21:27.680- 21:32.220* :  addiction. This is one of the reasons why the arguments that if you approach your in favour of
*21:32.220- 21:37.620* :  cigarettes is so surprising because this is a product which is designed to take your choice away.
*21:38.020- 21:43.340* :  So tobacco use is the single biggest preventable cause of death in Britain so it's banning is
*21:43.340- 21:49.540* :  popular among health experts. But what about MPs and the general public? I asked our UK political
*21:49.540- 21:54.940* :  correspondent Rob Watson. Let me say first this is a massive moment in British politics and
*21:54.940- 22:00.660* :  in global health and on that issue of preventable deaths. It's 80,000 annually in the UK costing
*22:00.660- 22:07.300* :  the UK over 20 billion dollars as the polling suggests that something like 70% of British people
*22:07.300- 22:12.120* :  think it's a really good idea to have a phased smoking ban. As the politics of it all the vast
*22:12.120- 22:18.380* :  majority of MPs also will support this. There is of course a split within the governing conservative
*22:18.380- 22:23.820* :  party which is well known has a sort of libertarian wing which just does not approve of it at all
*22:23.820- 22:29.000* :  and it includes former Prime Minister Boris Johnson who said it was nuts former Prime Minister
*22:29.000- 22:34.800* :  Liz Truss who says it's unconservative but it looks like it will pass and actually it'll probably
*22:34.800- 22:40.180* :  be the one piece of legislation that Mr Sunack will be most remembered for long after he's left
*22:40.180- 22:46.260* :  politics. Well how does the legislation relate to e-cigarettes? There's less detail there I mean
*22:46.260- 22:52.720* :  that the general gist of it Rachel it is it'll give ministers the power to make vaping less
*22:52.800- 22:58.500* :  attractive the packaging less attractive to those under 18 but it is up to government ministers
*22:58.500- 23:03.900* :  in future to decide just how best that'll work. Do you think it could be a blueprint for other
*23:03.900- 23:07.680* :  countries to follow? We mentioned New Zealand earlier what about other countries are they
*23:07.680- 23:12.600* :  interested in this? They're very interested indeed I think this is going to be watched closely
*23:12.600- 23:16.080* :  around the world I mean if you think about it according to the World Health Organization
*23:16.620- 23:22.380* :  over 70 countries now have indoor smoking bands you have countries like Portugal hoping to go
*23:22.380- 23:31.020* :  smoke-free by 2040 Canada hopes to get to reduce tobacco use to less than 5% by 2035 so absolutely
*23:31.020- 23:36.020* :  and and you you are right at the start Britain is going to have the most that the kind of strongest
*23:36.020- 23:41.700* :  anti-smoking legislation out there it will be followed closely and no doubt other countries that
*23:41.700- 23:46.200* :  have this sort of ambition of being smoke-free will say well perhaps one of the ways you have to do
*23:46.200- 23:52.880* :  that is to just make it impossible for younger people to buy cigarettes. Rob Watson are UK political
*23:53.580- 23:58.920* :  correspondent the Kenyan police have accused public hospital doctors who are on a month-long
*23:58.920- 24:04.600* :  strike of causing a public nuisance because they're obstructing highways and blowing whistles
*24:04.600- 24:10.120* :  and vuvuzelas today those doctors have upped the ante by marching to the Ministry of Health
*24:10.120- 24:15.000* :  and the capital Nairobi they accuse the government of being in a rears with salary payments
*24:15.000- 24:21.940* :  and of failing to hire trainee doctors on pre-agreed terms the doctors union secretary general
*24:21.940- 24:27.120* :  Davji Atala said the government was to blame for putting the life of patients at risk.
*24:27.580- 24:32.220* :  The government is the one on strike all these public sector unions we're all
*24:32.400- 24:37.540* :  saying we are ready to meet by the government that has previously been on strike and to make it
*24:37.540- 24:42.460* :  worse we saw in a university teaching a referral hospital and where the hospital is added
*24:43.260- 24:49.420* :  to import doctors or to import consultants all the doctor foreigners that were brought in failed
*24:49.420- 24:55.520* :  the test except one. Dorkas Wang Geera from Nairobi told me more about why they're on strike.
*24:56.180- 25:00.960* :  So the strike began on the 14th of March and the key reason at the time was that there were
*25:00.960- 25:06.080* :  interns this a junior doctor's who had not been posted around 1000 of them and also they're
*25:06.080- 25:11.140* :  this postgraduate students whose fees was not being paid by the government but as the days went by
*25:11.140- 25:15.980* :  the reasons increased the government failing to honour Alibar Agriament and now we are seeing
*25:15.980- 25:21.480* :  more unions join the strike claiming that their pay and their working conditions are not acceptable.
*25:21.940- 25:26.500* :  They've been on strike for a long time now so what's the situation with medical health care?
*25:26.800- 25:32.160* :  It is a crisis and there's a saying in Kenya that every Kenyan is just one accident or one illness
*25:32.160- 25:36.640* :  away from poverty. You would dread not getting sick right now you would dread having an accident
*25:36.640- 25:40.440* :  because if you were taken to a public health care hospital there's no one to treat no one to
*25:40.440- 25:45.060* :  diagnose and many people are suffering particularly those who cannot afford private health care.
*25:45.340- 25:51.100* :  And the police are complaining about the noise and obstruction. Are the doctors really disrupting
*25:51.100- 25:55.900* :  life in Kenya and if so what's going to happen today? Yes the Inspector General of Police did
*25:55.900- 26:00.680* :  issue a statement and he did call what the doctors are doing a nuisance and that has sparked a
*26:00.680- 26:06.140* :  lot of outrage. It is true doctors are coming out with vuvuzela's with whistles with placards
*26:06.260- 26:10.280* :  and they're also singing and they're walking but they say this is the only language the government
*26:10.280- 26:14.760* :  understands. Today the Kenya National Commission for Human Rights has issued a statement
*26:14.760- 26:20.340* :  condemning their Inspector General of Police. The doctors union rather has also moved to see
*26:20.340- 26:24.520* :  the Inspector General of Police because he claims that he and the security minister undermining
*26:24.520- 26:28.680* :  their right to protest. They are beginning their procession from the Kineta National Hospital
*26:29.160- 26:32.960* :  and I did see the clinical officers being told to make sure they bring those vuvuzela's
*26:33.120- 26:38.000* :  and those whistles. You say that the health care isn't a really bad dire situation. Is there any
*26:38.000- 26:44.400* :  support from the public for these doctors? So we have seen a lot of mixed reactions. We have seen
*26:44.400- 26:48.700* :  people in solidarity with the doctors because the doctors say that they're championing for better
*26:48.700- 26:54.100* :  public health care. We've seen a lot of propaganda. This is you know now the war is being fought online
*26:54.620- 27:00.380* :  with hashtags and counter hashtags but overall people who go to public hospitals understand why
*27:00.380- 27:05.420* :  public health care must work and why doctors must be paid. In Kenya it takes six years to train
*27:05.420- 27:09.760* :  as a doctor and these are the best students. So people are saying how how does this make sense
*27:09.760- 27:14.120* :  that you have the people who are trained well with so much money being told to earn so little.
*27:14.860- 27:19.420* :  Dorcas Wangira finally to a new urban revolution in France.
*27:19.500- 27:25.220* :  Latest research has revealed that Parisians now make more journeys by bike than by car.
*27:25.640- 27:29.540* :  Our Paris correspondent Andrew Harding took to two wheels to investigate.
*27:32.380- 27:37.460* :  I am cycling onto the couples of the Shawzili's age, much like the two of France.
*27:38.480- 27:45.400* :  I'm in my own special cycle lane, concrete divider separating us from the cars in the other traffic.
*27:47.040- 27:53.700* :  In the last couple of years these cycle lanes have just sprouted all over the city and it makes
*27:53.700- 28:00.460* :  cycling a much safer and much more relaxing process than trying to compete with the cars.
*28:01.220- 28:05.280* :  We've just gone past the Grand Palais there where the fencing is going to take place during the
*28:05.280- 28:11.360* :  Olympics in a few months, coming into the place that I can't call. So since really COVID and
*28:11.360- 28:17.640* :  since the Mayan and Hidalgo started trying to transform Paris into much more of a cycling and
*28:17.640- 28:22.800* :  pedestrian city, it's changed dramatically for the first time. The evidence from research
*28:22.800- 28:30.640* :  shows that bicycle journeys now far clips car journeys by 11 percent to 4 percent.
*28:31.740- 28:35.000* :  I know it takes somebody easy to get a nice cream on his bicycle.
*28:37.340- 28:43.820* :  We are cycling along the side of the Gardens near the Louvre and there are four traffic lanes.
*28:44.740- 28:51.680* :  Three of them are for bicycles only. The cars and the buses are all squeezed onto one little lane
*28:51.680- 28:58.620* :  on the far side and that for me really sums up the shift here. In priorities, in power,
*28:59.780- 29:05.760* :  in attitudes. What's your excuse me? What's your name? John, what do you think of cycling in Paris?
*29:06.200- 29:09.220* :  In the last couple of years, I've been loads of bike paths to put in.
*29:09.600- 29:13.620* :  You feel a lot safer? Yeah. Where are you from? Australia. They're here 20 years.
*29:13.760- 29:19.780* :  Off you go. John, that's a question to you. Excuse me, ma.
*29:19.780- 29:25.740* :  Is Palais anglais? Yes. Oh hi. What's your name? Marie. Your French? Yes. How do you like cycling
*29:25.740- 29:30.460* :  in Paris these days? I love it. I see you've got room for a small child or a baby on the back.
*29:30.460- 29:34.740* :  Yes, I have to. So you take your children to school regularly, to school,
*29:34.740- 29:39.860* :  to the park everywhere? And how have things changed in the last few years for cyclists?
*29:39.940- 29:45.300* :  There are much more cyclists in Paris due to the new organisation, thanks to Adi Lengel.
*29:45.600- 29:48.920* :  She's the mayor, Adi Lengel, yes. What in particular has changed?
*29:49.200- 29:54.180* :  These are the cycle routes. The cycle routes. And the fact that we can see here, there's a big
*29:54.180- 29:58.580* :  concrete block just dividing us from the cars. Yeah, exactly. It's much more safer.
*29:58.580- 30:04.200* :  There are much more cyclists in Paris. I don't like that actually. Too many bicycles. Too many bicycles.
*30:05.040- 30:10.220* :  So Marie makes an interesting point there, or about maybe having too many cyclists.
*30:10.480- 30:15.860* :  And one of the reasons that cycling is so easy in Paris, of course, is that it's a very flat
*30:15.860- 30:21.840* :  city and it's a very small city. Here's the statistic we haven't mentioned yet, which I think is
*30:21.840- 30:29.160* :  also very important. And that is the fact that 53% of journeys in Paris. So more than half of
*30:29.160- 30:37.280* :  all journeys every day in Paris are made on foot. Andrew Harding, cycling in Paris.
