*01:09.720- 01:14.600* :  I'm Gillette Gillil and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday the 23rd of April, these are our main
*01:14.600- 01:15.140* :  stories.
*01:15.740- 01:20.280* :  Just hours after the British government passes a contentious bill to deport migrants
*01:20.280- 01:26.440* :  to Rwanda, five people die trying to sail to the UK from France in a distressing scene
*01:26.440- 01:28.020* :  witnessed by our reporter.
*01:28.340- 01:33.460* :  There were just far too many people trying to squeeze inside this little inflatable dinghy.
*01:33.740- 01:37.520* :  What we've since learnt is that we were watching people on a circle being crushed under
*01:37.520- 01:40.540* :  foot, perhaps suffocated, trampled to death.
*01:41.340- 01:47.120* :  A father begins legal action against oil giant BP over his son's cancer death in Iraq.
*01:47.940- 01:54.220* :  That's as furthest flung probe carrying messages from IRF finally phones home after five months
*01:54.220- 01:55.160* :  of no contact.
*01:58.440- 01:59.360* :  Also in this podcast?
*01:59.880- 02:04.060* :  If I'd have asked a year ago, my family or anybody else, if it was a good idea to run
*02:04.060- 02:09.180* :  topless, I'm sure 100% of them would have said no I don't think so, but I didn't ask
*02:09.180- 02:09.820* :  then I did it.
*02:10.340- 02:15.000* :  The woman who raised topless in the London marathon to show her mastectomy scars.
*02:20.080- 02:24.040* :  Just hours after the British government finally managed to push through a controversial
*02:24.060- 02:29.700* :  bill to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, there's been a poignant reminder of the human
*02:29.700- 02:32.460* :  cost of people illegally trying to enter Britain.
*02:33.140- 02:37.840* :  At least five people, including a child, have died while trying to cross the channel from
*02:37.880- 02:38.280* :  France.
*02:38.860- 02:42.880* :  Our correspondent Andrew Harding was on the beach near Calais as people there tried to
*02:42.880- 02:46.640* :  board an inflatable boat and he witnessed the chaos that followed.
*02:46.840- 02:50.780* :  We should warn you that some of his report is deeply distressing.
*02:51.360- 02:56.700* :  Suddenly we heard a noise and it was the police shouting that they'd spotted some migrants
*02:56.700- 03:01.260* :  and we ran with the police and saw about a hundred, perhaps more than a hundred migrants,
*03:01.900- 03:03.560* :  running across the beach.
*03:03.560- 03:06.020* :  It was damp, the tide had just gone out.
*03:06.020- 03:09.820* :  They had several hundred meters to run towards the sea.
*03:09.820- 03:15.080* :  They were dragging in inflatable and as the police got closer, essentially a fight began
*03:15.780- 03:22.340* :  as the smugglers and the migrants started bringing out sticks and rods and essentially forming
*03:22.340- 03:28.440* :  a protective curtain around the migrants to allow them to continue advancing towards
*03:28.800- 03:30.920* :  the sea, to take their boat into the water.
*03:30.920- 03:35.040* :  They were throwing firecrackers as well, so there was explosions, there was smoke.
*03:35.580- 03:41.740* :  The police seemed unable to do anything they said later that they didn't want to interfere
*03:41.740- 03:46.820* :  with the police or children there, but it was too dangerous that the migrants were already
*03:46.820- 03:47.460* :  in the water.
*03:47.920- 03:54.620* :  What happened then was that they got into a boat and we saw it drift slowly, just a few
*03:55.160- 04:02.200* :  yards off the shore, but we could very quickly tell that there was trouble going on in the
*04:02.200- 04:02.840* :  boat itself.
*04:02.840- 04:08.220* :  There were just far too many people trying to squeeze inside this little inflatable dinghy
*04:08.540- 04:13.780* :  and you could see people standing in the middle and what we've since learned is that we
*04:13.780- 04:19.600* :  were watching people on a circle being crushed underfoot, perhaps suffocated, trampled to death.
*04:20.660- 04:23.620* :  We've heard reports that some people may have drowned, that's not clear.
*04:23.620- 04:26.400* :  We saw some life jackets in the water.
*04:26.400- 04:31.480* :  We heard some cries, but at that time it was not clear to us what was happening.
*04:31.480- 04:37.320* :  It felt like just a melee that we've seen before as people try and fight for a spot on
*04:37.320- 04:42.060* :  the life raft on the inflatable and then the boat drifted a bit further out to sea.
*04:42.620- 04:49.580* :  We could see some small rescue boats from a much bigger French rescue ship starting to
*04:49.580- 04:53.860* :  approach the boat, but at that point we still had no sense that anyone was injured.
*04:54.220- 04:59.900* :  We assumed that they were simply trying to offer help and perhaps to push the boat back
*04:59.900- 05:02.760* :  to shore if it was required because the boat was not under power.
*05:03.020- 05:04.840* :  It was stalled, it was just drifting.
*05:06.200- 05:10.960* :  These deaths came as a British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, has pledged that asylum seekers
*05:10.960- 05:14.240* :  were startling flown to a revander within the next three months.
*05:14.780- 05:19.480* :  The British Supreme Court had ruled the scheme was unlawful, but the Home Office Minister
*05:19.480- 05:24.420* :  Andrew Sharp said revander was a safe country for people to be processed.
*05:25.340- 05:27.660* :  This bill does comply with international law.
*05:28.240- 05:32.280* :  It is profoundly moral and patriotic to defend the integrity of our borders.
*05:33.600- 05:38.440* :  It is profoundly moral and patriotic to prevent the needless loss of life in the channel
*05:38.600- 05:40.640* :  and to put the criminal gangs out of business.
*05:42.040- 05:45.980* :  Stephen Kinnick from the Opposition Labour Party in Britain said the asylum bill was an
*05:45.980- 05:49.840* :  expensive gimmick and wouldn't stop desperate people dying.
*05:50.400- 05:56.160* :  The test of a policy like this is will it work as a deterrent, but when you're dealing
*05:56.160- 06:01.100* :  with people who have risked life and limb to cross continents, they are not going to
*06:01.100- 06:05.260* :  be put off by a 1% chance of being sent to Rwanda.
*06:05.260- 06:07.660* :  So the policy fails on its own terms.
*06:08.620- 06:12.920* :  Our political correspondent Rob Watson told us more about how the new law is being seen
*06:12.940- 06:15.660* :  in the UK and wider field.
*06:15.660- 06:20.840* :  It's hugely significant, not just here in the UK but globally, here in the UK because
*06:21.400- 06:27.040* :  the Rwanda planes policy as an absolute keynotes for the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and intended
*06:27.040- 06:32.020* :  as a profound political dividing line with the main Opposition Labour Party, but globally
*06:32.020- 06:35.920* :  because no Western country, no countries tried anything like this.
*06:35.980- 06:41.220* :  I mean, yes, there have been the idea of our processing the claims of asylum seekers
*06:41.220- 06:46.040* :  in a third country with the aim of maybe coming back to the country that sort of what Australia
*06:46.040- 06:46.320* :  did.
*06:46.700- 06:49.120* :  This is unique in the sense that these are one-way flights.
*06:49.120- 06:51.880* :  The idea is your centre Rwanda, that's it.
*06:51.880- 06:54.440* :  You file your claim there and not in the UK.
*06:56.020- 06:59.800* :  But the UN has called Britain now to rethink this plan.
*07:00.400- 07:05.840* :  It has indeed, in a truly sort of scheming statement, a joint statement by the UN High Commissioners
*07:05.840- 07:08.120* :  for both refugees and human rights.
*07:08.120- 07:10.780* :  And I'm going to read you a little bit of it, Jeanette, for everybody.
*07:11.460- 07:15.580* :  So they say the new legislation marks a further step away from the UK's long tradition
*07:15.640- 07:19.620* :  of providing refuge to those in need in breach of the refugee convention.
*07:19.620- 07:24.660* :  They also go on to say the new law seriously hinders the rule of law in the UK and sets
*07:25.120- 07:26.720* :  a perilous precedent globally.
*07:26.720- 07:29.520* :  And that's the point that I was making and answered your first question.
*07:29.520- 07:32.660* :  The reason why it's significant is that this hasn't been tried.
*07:32.660- 07:34.260* :  The UN doesn't like the idea.
*07:34.340- 07:39.420* :  The UK government argues that this is what is actually needed, not just in Britain, but
*07:39.420- 07:43.480* :  elsewhere in order to try and disrupt a global migration movements.
*07:44.360- 07:46.340* :  And the key question is, will it work?
*07:46.380- 07:51.200* :  A lot of skepticism about that, given the fact that so many people risk their lives already
*07:51.200- 07:52.640* :  to try to reach Britain?
*07:53.140- 07:56.740* :  Yes. And the other argument that you heard from the Labour spokesman, which is essentially
*07:56.740- 08:03.560* :  if you've got 30,000 people arriving last year, 40,000 last year, would send in 2, 3,
*08:03.560- 08:06.440* :  400 to Rwandria, really be a deterrent.
*08:06.440- 08:08.200* :  But absolutely, that is the test.
*08:09.040- 08:12.920* :  And a lot of people are saying part of the reason the Prime Minister has pushed this
*08:12.920- 08:15.520* :  through right now is because of forthcoming elections.
*08:15.520- 08:17.760* :  But will it be a big issue for voters?
*08:18.580- 08:22.220* :  The polling suggestion at that it is a big issue, along with the cost of living,
*08:22.220- 08:23.560* :  the state of the economy.
*08:23.560- 08:25.680* :  But here is the difficult thing for the government.
*08:25.680- 08:30.780* :  The polling suggests that most people don't like the idea of migrants crossing the channel.
*08:31.320- 08:36.420* :  The polling also suggests that they approve of the idea of sending people away on planes,
*08:36.420- 08:40.140* :  whether to Rwanda or to anywhere else, but, and you knew that was about coming.
*08:40.760- 08:46.360* :  The polling also suggests that the government is so massively unpopular that even if planes
*08:46.360- 08:51.620* :  do go to Rwanda, even if there were a sort of a deterrent effect, it probably wouldn't
*08:51.620- 08:55.840* :  have any effect on the conservatives, rather miserable fortunes at the moment.
*08:56.840- 08:57.380* :  Rob Watson.
*08:58.400- 09:02.000* :  Ali Jalud was a keen footballer, a boy with big dreams.
*09:02.000- 09:04.860* :  But he became sick with leukemia at the age of 15.
*09:05.820- 09:08.400* :  Last year he died at the age of just 21.
*09:09.200- 09:15.200* :  Now Ali's father has begun legal action against the oil giant BP, who, saying Jalud,
*09:15.200- 09:20.680* :  alleges that gas burning at an oil field run by the firm in southern Iraq caused his
*09:20.720- 09:21.560* :  son's leukemia.
*09:22.140- 09:26.740* :  He said the process, known as flaring near his village, has exposed people there to toxic
*09:26.740- 09:33.160* :  levels of cancer-causing pollutants, acclaimed backed up by a BBC documentary in 2022.
*09:33.960- 09:35.600* :  Our reporter is Esby Stallard.
*09:35.800- 09:41.180* :  I ask her if this was the first time an individual has brought such a case against a major oil
*09:41.180- 09:41.620* :  company.
*09:42.240- 09:43.040* :  It is exactly.
*09:43.040- 09:47.920* :  We've heard before where governments have taken companies to core over flour, maybe
*09:47.920- 09:49.160* :  it's breached regulation.
*09:49.700- 09:53.660* :  But this is the first time we actually think an individual is seeking compensation, where
*09:53.660- 09:57.260* :  they believe that flaring may have caused harm to them and their family.
*09:57.260- 10:01.740* :  So it would be illegal first, not just in the UK, but we think across the world.
*10:01.800- 10:04.080* :  What is Mr Jalud looking for here?
*10:04.340- 10:08.920* :  Within the letter of claim which was sent out on Monday afternoon, so yesterday we're
*10:08.920- 10:10.060* :  just hearing about it now.
*10:10.060- 10:14.440* :  What he's ultimately seeking is compensation for financial losses, particularly medical
*10:14.440- 10:16.000* :  treatment that Ali went under.
*10:16.020- 10:21.520* :  So as you said there, he was diagnosed in 2015, he was battling leukemia for six years
*10:21.520- 10:23.680* :  and that involved multiple trips.
*10:24.180- 10:28.700* :  Not just within Iraq hospitals there, but abroad to Turkey, because you can't be treated
*10:28.720- 10:30.680* :  for the leukemia that he was struggling with.
*10:30.680- 10:34.620* :  So those costs, the costs in terms of the moral loss of his son.
*10:34.640- 10:40.360* :  So the impact that's had on his family, but ultimately when I spoke to his angelude over
*10:40.360- 10:43.940* :  the weekend, he said really for him, he just wants the flaring to stop.
*10:43.940- 10:46.800* :  You know, it's affecting other families within his town.
*10:47.080- 10:48.120* :  And that's the thing, isn't it?
*10:48.120- 10:51.220* :  It's not just about one family, however sad this story is.
*10:51.540- 10:56.760* :  This claim follows a BBC documentary back in 2022 that revealed there were high levels
*10:56.760- 11:00.720* :  of flaring near this village and other villages at Ramella.
*11:01.100- 11:01.460* :  Exactly.
*11:01.620- 11:06.580* :  So a document that was done by BBC Arabic called Underpoison Skies, what they looked at
*11:06.580- 11:11.380* :  is they looked at a number of oil fields that were across the region surrounding Basra
*11:11.380- 11:14.680* :  in Iraq and in this case of Ramella and other villages.
*11:14.680- 11:17.420* :  The flaring was happening very, very close in some cases.
*11:17.420- 11:19.760* :  It was just hundreds of meters from their front door.
*11:20.300- 11:25.120* :  Now under Iraqi law, it's not meant to happen anywhere within 10 kilometres
*11:25.120- 11:27.320* :  because gas flaring can be so dangerous.
*11:27.320- 11:30.980* :  So there are actually many people within the region that are affected by this practice.
*11:31.520- 11:33.260* :  And what has BP had to say?
*11:33.700- 11:37.540* :  Well, at the time they said they understand the concerns that were raised in the documentary.
*11:37.540- 11:42.660* :  And when we asked about this letter of claim, they reiterated that statement
*11:42.660- 11:44.220* :  and said they understand the concerns.
*11:44.220- 11:48.240* :  But the pushback from Mr. Jolid is that they've said this before.
*11:48.840- 11:53.460* :  And in the three years since the documentary came out the filming first started,
*11:53.460- 11:54.780* :  that flaring hasn't changed.
*11:54.780- 11:58.480* :  And we've seen images and videos very much showing that flaring is still happening.
*11:58.480- 12:03.280* :  So he's hoping that this letter or this legal action will hopefully change that.
*12:04.500- 12:05.560* :  Esme Stellard.
*12:06.400- 12:09.940* :  It's the furthest human-made object gliding in space,
*12:09.980- 12:14.060* :  currently around 24 billion kilometres away from Earth.
*12:14.440- 12:17.900* :  The spacecraft, Voyager One, was launched back in 1977
*12:18.720- 12:23.280* :  with a cargo of gold-plated vinyl LPs containing recordings of Beethoven,
*12:23.280- 12:25.220* :  Bach and Chuck Berry,
*12:25.680- 12:30.180* :  along with greetings to any possible aliens out there in 55 languages.
*12:36.500- 12:38.980* :  Hello from the children of planet Earth.
*12:39.360- 12:40.280* :  Hello, everyone.
*12:41.020- 12:41.620* :  Got why, Homer?
*12:42.260- 12:42.880* :  Chuck got why.
*12:43.380- 12:45.040* :  Ping on, Ginhang, Phylock.
*12:54.380- 12:59.520* :  But at the age of 46, Voyager One is like many of us starting to show signs of aging.
*12:59.520- 13:05.240* :  After five months of the space probe transmitting, what's been described as gibberish back to Earth,
*13:05.580- 13:08.900* :  scientists say they've now found a new way to decode the data.
*13:09.460- 13:13.640* :  Karen and Porco, a planetary scientist and former member of the Voyager imaging team,
*13:13.640- 13:17.160* :  spoke to Justin Webb about the issues engineers faced.
*13:17.800- 13:19.420* :  They know what the problem is.
*13:19.460- 13:24.240* :  They've determined that they will be able to fix it, but they haven't fixed it yet.
*13:24.240- 13:30.120* :  But what we haven't been receiving is just information from, certainly from the science instruments.
*13:30.120- 13:36.280* :  And there are instruments on board Voyager that basically sense the environment that it's in.
*13:36.440- 13:39.760* :  And remember, we've been doing this with Voyager One since 2012,
*13:39.760- 13:44.740* :  after it broke through the magnetic bubble of the sun, and it entered interstellar space.
*13:45.760- 13:47.280* :  And that was a big moment.
*13:48.040- 13:50.520* :  And that's when they knew they're an interstellar space,
*13:50.560- 13:52.560* :  and they're learning things about interstellar space.
*13:52.560- 13:58.500* :  The strength of the magnetic fields, the concentrations of particles, and so on.
*13:58.560- 14:00.300* :  And you know, this is exploration.
*14:00.880- 14:04.800* :  Voyager One is 15 billion miles away now, isn't it?
*14:04.880- 14:08.360* :  How long do you think it can carry on if it's fixed?
*14:08.700- 14:11.240* :  What will limit this will likely be?
*14:11.300- 14:14.620* :  I mean, unless it has a catastrophic failure where they, you know,
*14:14.620- 14:19.000* :  it does just never talk anymore, and they don't know if they can't do anything about it.
*14:19.280- 14:24.000* :  If it dies a natural death, let's call it that, it will be because it's power supply,
*14:24.060- 14:28.880* :  the RTGs, the radioactive sources that are keeping it power.
*14:28.880- 14:30.040* :  They just peter out.
*14:30.180- 14:33.560* :  Their strength grows weaker and weaker and weaker with time.
*14:33.560- 14:41.140* :  And you know, they're just not going to be powerful enough anymore to even drive the limited
*14:41.720- 14:43.780* :  activities that the Voyager is doing now.
*14:43.780- 14:50.080* :  So I think the expectation is that it will die within, you know, the next five years.
*14:50.420- 14:52.560* :  I mean, they're trying very hard to just keep it going.
*14:53.320- 14:57.720* :  You know, we all want to see it continue because there was no other mission like Voyager.
*14:57.720- 15:01.440* :  Voyager was, I don't think it's too much to say.
*15:01.440- 15:05.080* :  It was the greatest voyage of exploration that humanity had ever conducted.
*15:05.340- 15:08.080* :  It's likely to continue after we're gone.
*15:08.220- 15:15.060* :  It's an amazing thought and it's not foolish to feel that those spacecraft, you know,
*15:15.440- 15:19.360* :  gifted us with some measure of immortality because of that.
*15:19.360- 15:24.120* :  And it's just such an exalting feeling to think that something that we touched,
*15:24.280- 15:27.300* :  we made, we touched is going to be carrying on.
*15:27.540- 15:32.040* :  And you know, it's, if you're into that kind of thing, it's just a wonderful thing.
*15:33.060- 15:35.220* :  Planetary scientists, Karen Porco.
*15:36.120- 15:40.800* :  A row has broken out between Elon Musk and the Australian government over access to footage
*15:40.800- 15:44.460* :  that shows a stabbing in a church in Sydney earlier this month.
*15:44.460- 15:50.240* :  An Australian court has ordered Mr. Musk's social media platform X to take down the video
*15:50.960- 15:53.560* :  across the world, not just in Australia.
*15:54.060- 15:56.240* :  But Mr. Musk is challenging the ruling.
*15:56.240- 16:01.540* :  He said it meant that any single country could control what was posted on the entire internet.
*16:02.120- 16:06.520* :  The Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, criticized Mr. Musk's decision.
*16:07.080- 16:12.420* :  We'll do what's necessary to take on this arrogant billionaire who thinks he's above the law,
*16:13.200- 16:15.080* :  but also above common decency.
*16:15.740- 16:22.980* :  What the E Safety Commission is doing is doing her job to protect the interests of Australians.
*16:23.660- 16:32.080* :  And the idea that someone would go to court for the right to put up violent content on a platform
*16:32.780- 16:35.280* :  shows how out of touch Mr. Musk is.
*16:36.180- 16:38.860* :  Anthony Albanese speaking to the broadcaster ABC.
*16:38.860- 16:41.620* :  We got more from our reporter in Sydney, Phil Mercer.
*16:41.900- 16:48.600* :  This is an escalating row between not only the Australian government but politicians of all
*16:48.600- 16:55.840* :  political persuasions here and the owner of the social media platform X Elon Musk.
*16:55.940- 17:02.660* :  It's a row over graphic video of a stabbing attack at a church in Sydney a week ago.
*17:02.660- 17:08.100* :  An Australian court has ordered X to hide videos of the attack.
*17:08.100- 17:14.940* :  They show an assault on a cleric and also other members of a congregation at a church in
*17:14.940- 17:22.000* :  Western Sydney. X did say that it would comply with the court order pending a legal challenge,
*17:22.180- 17:26.180* :  but certainly the argument between both sides is continuing.
*17:26.180- 17:32.180* :  Elon Musk has posted a meme online that accuses Australia of censorship.
*17:32.180- 17:36.040* :  And as we've heard from the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese,
*17:36.040- 17:42.760* :  he's accusing the tech billionaire of thinking that he's above the law and calling him arrogant.
*17:42.780- 17:48.020* :  What is Mr. Musk's justification for allowing it to be found on X?
*17:48.340- 17:54.900* :  Well Mr. Musk says that this is all about freedom of speech and freedom of the internet.
*17:54.900- 17:58.120* :  This video I've seen it, it's very confronting.
*17:58.120- 18:04.420* :  It shows a young man casually walking down the aisle of a church towards the altar
*18:04.460- 18:11.740* :  before a series of blows is rained around the upper body of a bishop giving a sermon.
*18:11.920- 18:16.860* :  And this ended up online because the service, the mass at a church in Western Sydney,
*18:16.860- 18:19.320* :  was being live streamed at the time.
*18:19.820- 18:24.300* :  Now politicians, as I say, from all sides of the political spectrum in Australia
*18:24.660- 18:30.420* :  have criticized Mr. Musk, one cabinet minister saying that he was an ego-tistical billionaire.
*18:30.460- 18:36.040* :  But Mr. Musk has always said that this is about freedom of information, the freedom of speech,
*18:36.600- 18:38.060* :  and the freedom of the internet.
*18:38.060- 18:45.780* :  So in many ways, this is a case that will test how far reaching Australian laws are beyond Australia.
*18:46.540- 18:47.840* :  Phil Mercer, in Sydney.
*18:50.640- 18:52.240* :  Still to come on the global news podcast.
*18:52.780- 18:55.580* :  Some say the luck makes sweet division.
*18:56.580- 19:00.480* :  This does not so, for she divided us.
*19:01.620- 19:04.460* :  Shakespeare's love of words and numbers.
*19:13.120- 19:15.020* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*19:15.760- 19:20.600* :  It took months of wrangling for a huge military aid packet for Ukraine to be approved by the
*19:20.600- 19:24.800* :  lower house of the U.S. Congress. But its passage is all but certain in the upper house
*19:24.800- 19:29.340* :  the Senate, when it votes today on the 61 billion dollars earmarked for Ukraine,
*19:29.340- 19:34.020* :  alongside military assistance to other key U.S. allies, Israel and Taiwan.
*19:34.720- 19:39.300* :  It can't come soon enough for the Ukrainian military, which is facing a severe shortage
*19:39.300- 19:42.880* :  of weapons and new recruits as Russian troops advance.
*19:42.920- 19:45.000* :  So what can the Ukrainians expect?
*19:45.420- 19:47.680* :  Here's our key of correspondent James Waterhouse.
*19:53.560- 19:59.340* :  If you don't fancy the hill, but aren't in a rush, Kiev's finicular is a fun way to get from
*20:00.860- 20:04.920* :  the Podil district by the river to the centre of the city.
*20:04.920- 20:10.560* :  And as you leave behind the Art Deco style station at the bottom, you think about Ukraine's
*20:10.960- 20:13.200* :  relentless uphill battle.
*20:14.620- 20:19.660* :  As it tries to escape Russia's grasp, the arrival of this American help has brought
*20:19.660- 20:26.980* :  some relief, but few here are expecting it to result in an instant seizing of the initiative
*20:26.980- 20:28.120* :  by Ukrainian troops.
*20:33.980- 20:40.620* :  At the top in this coupled square, there are half a dozen Russian tanks captured
*20:41.580- 20:45.300* :  in the battle of Kiev at the start of the full-scale invasion, but they have gradually
*20:45.300- 20:47.960* :  turned from green to brown with rust.
*20:48.740- 20:54.240* :  War trophies are hard to come by these days for Ukraine as we stand under.
*20:55.080- 21:00.940* :  The Golden Domes of St. Michael's Cathedral, nevertheless, the arrival of this American ammunition
*21:01.400- 21:02.900* :  has been welcomed by troops.
*21:04.000- 21:05.720* :  My name is Yuri Kocivenko.
*21:06.420- 21:14.240* :  I am a Ukrainian soldier and I want on my own behalf and on behalf of my brother in arms
*21:14.580- 21:22.000* :  to thank every American who, through their actions and citizenship, brought this decision closer.
*21:22.340- 21:23.260* :  Together we are stronger.
*21:24.040- 21:25.100* :  God bless America.
*21:28.120- 21:30.660* :  So what difference can this aid really make?
*21:30.660- 21:34.440* :  Mekola Bieliskov is a military analyst here in Kiev.
*21:34.900- 21:39.440* :  This package, hopefully, will help fully stabilise the front line and show a proper
*21:39.920- 21:45.640* :  attrition balance at favor Ukraine and basically drive Russia to the conclusion that they can't
*21:45.780- 21:52.920* :  advance and that would be a minimum marker requirement to say that this year campaign for Ukraine
*21:53.680- 21:54.440* :  was successful.
*21:56.820- 22:02.160* :  The six months of delay to this American package has been costly for Ukraine.
*22:03.200- 22:07.100* :  It's lost more territory and men as a direct result.
*22:10.680- 22:15.160* :  At this memorial war near St. Michael's Cathedral, the loss is tangible.
*22:15.160- 22:20.960* :  There are flowers stretching for 80 meters underneath pictures of soldiers who died from as far
*22:20.960- 22:26.900* :  back as 2014 with the outbreak of Russian aggression, all the way up to the brighter coloured
*22:26.900- 22:30.860* :  photographs from 2022 onwards with the full-scale invasion.
*22:34.100- 22:38.400* :  It's here we meet Slitlana who's looking to put a photo of her husband here.
*22:38.660- 22:40.400* :  He was killed last year.
*22:43.080- 22:44.500* :  It's good they approved the aid.
*22:45.040- 22:46.800* :  We need to kick that Russians come away.
*22:47.500- 22:48.300* :  I hate them.
*22:49.120- 22:50.560* :  Why did they come to our land?
*22:51.340- 22:57.860* :  I see so many young guys here, our finest man, and they are same age as my children.
*22:59.020- 23:05.320* :  I hope they give us the aid to drive the Russians out so that no one would get killed anymore.
*23:06.220- 23:12.320* :  Slitlana is clearly still grieving a year after her husband's death.
*23:12.320- 23:21.080* :  And this war will keep growing, but this American help might just bring its end closer
*23:21.340- 23:25.140* :  on terms that Ukraine might be able to influence.
*23:26.680- 23:28.960* :  That report by James Waterhouse.
*23:29.880- 23:34.600* :  Homelessness in the United States is at record levels with housing costs increasingly
*23:34.600- 23:37.320* :  out of reach for hundreds of thousands of people.
*23:37.880- 23:41.820* :  Now the US Supreme Court is considering a legal challenge from the state of Oregon
*23:41.820- 23:47.860* :  over whether homeless people can be detained and fined for setting up encampments in public places.
*23:48.560- 23:51.260* :  Although the challenge relates to one local area in Oregon,
*23:51.580- 23:55.700* :  any court ruling would have important national implications for how cities
*23:56.320- 23:57.160* :  respond to homelessness.
*23:57.780- 24:00.080* :  Ed Johnson is a lawyer representing the homeless.
*24:00.540- 24:01.500* :  The stakes are high.
*24:01.800- 24:05.240* :  Whatever the Supreme Court decides will become the law of the land.
*24:05.440- 24:09.780* :  And if people are essentially banished from the city borders, it will be chaos.
*24:10.420- 24:14.600* :  It will also give people new criminal records that's going to make it harder for them
*24:14.600- 24:17.360* :  to find work and to find housing and escape homelessness.
*24:17.360- 24:21.560* :  If we go down this road of criminalizing people and banishing them,
*24:22.000- 24:25.040* :  we're going to wake up two or three years down the road and we're going to have twice as many
*24:25.040- 24:26.480* :  homeless people as we have now.
*24:27.380- 24:32.640* :  Our correspondent Peter Boes, who's in Los Angeles, told Nick Miles what Oregon wants the court to allow.
*24:33.160- 24:38.040* :  The case centers, as you say, on one town in rural Oregon, Grants Pass,
*24:38.040- 24:43.820* :  population just under 40,000 people, which has introduced a local law or ordinance,
*24:43.820- 24:48.780* :  which bans camping or sleeping on public property or in city parks.
*24:48.780- 24:54.640* :  And it defines a campsite as anywhere there's bedding or sleeping bags or where a stove or a fire
*24:55.040- 25:00.480* :  is set up. Conditions that are typical of encampments used by people who are homeless and violators
*25:00.480- 25:07.400* :  could be fined up to $295 or face 20 days in jail for repeat offenses.
*25:08.020- 25:13.820* :  And this is a legal battle to uphold the city's right to enforce this policy.
*25:13.820- 25:18.120* :  But it could indeed have much broader implications for other parts of the country.
*25:18.440- 25:24.020* :  I imagine that the people who are opposed to this are asking how does finding or jailing homeless
*25:24.020- 25:30.260* :  people help them at all. Well, critics will say it clearly doesn't help that allowing cities to
*25:30.260- 25:36.320* :  punish people who need a place to sleep, they say, will criminalize homelessness and ultimately
*25:36.320- 25:43.240* :  make the crisis much worse. The city in Oregon says the fines and possible jail time are necessary
*25:43.240- 25:49.020* :  deterrents for people setting up homeless encampments. And what is interesting looking at the
*25:49.020- 25:54.580* :  discussions so far at the Supreme Court, the three liberal justices have expressed concern
*25:55.120- 26:00.960* :  about how homeless people are treated, noting that sleeping is a basic human need.
*26:00.960- 26:07.280* :  Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, where are we supposed to put them? If every city, every village,
*26:07.280- 26:13.940* :  every town lacks compassion and passes a law identical to this, where are they supposed to sleep?
*26:14.500- 26:17.380* :  Are they supposed to kill themselves? Not sleeping.
*26:17.640- 26:21.840* :  One of the things that happened during the COVID pandemic was that shelter was found for homeless
*26:21.840- 26:27.340* :  people by the government. Is the government doing planning to extend those kind of measures or let
*26:27.340- 26:32.820* :  them expire completely? It appears to be the latter indeed quite the opposite to extending those
*26:32.820- 26:38.200* :  funds are running out here in California, which is home to one third of the country's homeless
*26:38.200- 26:44.740* :  population. Shelters usually hotels or motels set up because of COVID, as you say, have closed.
*26:44.940- 26:50.420* :  And coupled with the cost of living crisis, rising rents, these are the reasons why homelessness
*26:50.420- 26:57.140* :  is getting much worse. In almost 30 years, living here in Los Angeles, I've covered this story many,
*26:57.140- 27:01.440* :  many times. And driving and walking around the city, I've never seen it as bad as it is now.
*27:01.980- 27:07.920* :  Peter Bose. The London mountain, like so many mountains around the world, is not just about record
*27:07.920- 27:14.260* :  breaking by elite athletes. It's about personal bests by individual runners and wacky and wonderful
*27:14.260- 27:19.240* :  costumes, which many wear to get sponsorship money for charities. This year's London marathon
*27:19.240- 27:26.180* :  raised more than $82 million for good causes, a world record for a one day fundraiser.
*27:26.800- 27:32.960* :  Checking part is an act of courage for many. This year, breast cancer survivor Louise Butcher
*27:32.960- 27:39.220* :  ran the race to show the scars from her double mastectomy. She's been speaking to Julian Marshall.
*27:39.800- 27:45.760* :  It started off that when I looked around the Facebook sites of ladies who had breast cancer,
*27:45.760- 27:51.780* :  there was a lot of negativity around mastectomies and a little bit of shame with that. And when I was
*27:51.780- 27:58.140* :  in the surgeon's office, I was also told that it would be in my best interest to have a reconstruction.
*27:58.760- 28:06.320* :  And I asked why and she said, from the research, it shows that staying flat and having flat
*28:06.320- 28:12.760* :  pleasure surgery will impact you negatively on your mental health in the long run. And I just felt
*28:12.760- 28:18.220* :  that there was something a little bit wrong with that. I felt that was from a social norm. So I wanted
*28:18.220- 28:23.660* :  to run topless, which I started doing a year ago. I did the virtual London marathon first topless,
*28:24.420- 28:30.580* :  to challenge people's perceptions of a lady without breasts, to actually sort of trigger them,
*28:30.960- 28:35.860* :  because I knew it was going to be shocking, but I wanted to find out where that stigma came from.
*28:36.480- 28:40.520* :  And especially when you've got scars and you've had your breasts removed and you choose not to have
*28:40.520- 28:47.680* :  reconstruction, there's a little bit of stigma attached to hiding that. And I felt that if I
*28:47.680- 28:55.280* :  showed the world or showed people what I actually was without breasts, that made me actually accept it
*28:55.280- 29:01.000* :  myself, because I wasn't coming home at night after I'd put a top on or put some fake breasts there,
*29:01.460- 29:06.240* :  taking off my top and looking in the mirror and seeing the scars. If everybody else can accept them
*29:06.240- 29:09.740* :  and I've shown them to everybody, I'm going to be able to accept them themselves.
*29:09.740- 29:16.700* :  And what was the reaction of the crowds on the streets of London on Sundays who ran past them?
*29:17.560- 29:23.080* :  It was unbelievable. They were so supportive. The crowd, you could see it was just
*29:24.160- 29:29.160* :  empowering to them. And I think when I was doing it, I knew it was needed.
*29:29.700- 29:34.260* :  Use the word shocking there earlier on in the interview. Do you acknowledge that some in the crowd
*29:34.260- 29:40.220* :  might have found it shocking? Yeah, and I think for change to happen, you also need to feel
*29:40.220- 29:46.360* :  uncomfortable. I think when we live in a bubble of a comfortable place, we don't move on,
*29:46.360- 29:52.380* :  we don't change. Any kind of change is uncomfortable and it's about pushing boundaries,
*29:52.960- 29:58.020* :  pushing social stereotypes, so all about being uncomfortable. So yeah, I knew that was going to
*29:58.920- 30:04.240* :  be the case in some people's reactions, but I also knew that it was needed.
*30:05.180- 30:11.720* :  And did you have to get permission from the organizers as a woman running topless in the London
*30:11.720- 30:17.500* :  marathon? I didn't get permission. I feel that when you do something that is going to change,
*30:17.500- 30:23.240* :  I think if you ask, like if I'd have asked a year ago, my family or anybody else, if it was a good
*30:23.240- 30:28.960* :  idea to run topless, I'm sure 100% of them would have said no, I don't think so. But I didn't ask
*30:28.980- 30:37.220* :  them. I did it. I knew that part of the reason women or men are not seeing topless is because they
*30:37.220- 30:43.240* :  have nipples and I haven't got nipples. I haven't got breasts. So I knew I wasn't breaking any
*30:43.240- 30:48.520* :  regulation or rules. I didn't want to risk it not being done because I thought the message was
*30:48.520- 30:53.840* :  where too important to be told now. I just wondered how physically you were feeling, not being
*30:53.840- 31:00.180* :  troubled by having anything on the upper half of your body. Yes, definitely. There is something very
*31:00.180- 31:06.920* :  freeing about running without breasts. And I sort of put it to like when you were sort of nine or
*31:06.940- 31:11.540* :  ten, when you were a kid and you were running free without your vest on and it wasn't seen as
*31:11.540- 31:16.060* :  anything because there was no sort of like social perception of having to cover up then. And you
*31:16.060- 31:21.480* :  just feel free and the breeze on your chest. And I actually feel less vulnerable without breasts to
*31:21.480- 31:26.060* :  be honest. I feel like a woman, I feel feminine, but I feel less vulnerable. So yeah, there's a lot
*31:26.060- 31:31.100* :  of positives about running topless and not having breasts, especially, well, obviously when you've
*31:31.100- 31:36.220* :  had cancer, don't forget, they have saved your life the scars. That's what I look at my scars as
*31:36.680- 31:40.240* :  they have saved my life. And they are going to let me see my children grow up.
*31:41.480- 31:46.860* :  Louise Butcher, the first woman to run the London Mouth and topless. Shakespeare fans celebrate
*31:46.860- 31:52.100* :  his birth day today, although we don't know the exact date. He's widely considered the greatest
*31:52.100- 31:57.540* :  ever English writer, but you may be surprised to learn that he also used maths in some of his most
*31:57.540- 32:03.220* :  memorable scenes. He lived and wrote at a time when new mathematical concepts were transforming
*32:03.220- 32:09.660* :  perceptions of the world, from astronomy to probability, music to multiplication. The new ideas
*32:09.660- 32:15.840* :  were taking off and much of this was reflected in his work. In Romeo and Juliet after spending
*32:15.840- 32:21.400* :  the night with Romeo, Juliet talks about the concept of division, cursing the lark for bringing
*32:21.400- 32:27.520* :  in the dawn, meaning he has to leave before the lovers are caught. It is the lark that sings so
*32:27.520- 32:37.080* :  out of tune, straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. Sunsays a lark makes sweet division.
*32:38.000- 32:45.900* :  This does not so, for she divided us. And Shakespeare talks about the concept of zero from the
*32:45.900- 32:52.000* :  opening of Henry V, where the chorus announces that the actors will recreate the battle of Agencour.
*32:52.940- 33:00.120* :  Can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of France? Or may we cram within this wooden
*33:00.700- 33:11.800* :  cask that did a fright the air at Agencour? Oh pardon, since a crooked figure may attest in little
*33:11.800- 33:21.900* :  place a million and let us ciphers to this great account on your imaginary forces work.
*33:23.000- 33:28.040* :  Robby's the way is the author of a new book, Much A Do About Numbers. He explained to Justin
*33:28.040- 33:33.620* :  where the bar's fascination with mass and how he turned numbers into poetry in his place.
*33:34.360- 33:40.060* :  My thesis is, we think of Shakespeare as a guy who's creative with words, but actually as I've
*33:40.060- 33:45.340* :  investigated him, it turns out he's very creative with numbers too. And he lived in a renaissance era
*33:45.340- 33:51.040* :  where subjects were joined together much more than they are now really. So, you know, what started
*33:51.040- 33:55.880* :  as a project as a bit of a joke at a teacher conference in Stratford on Avon, a friend and I thinking,
*33:56.080- 34:01.820* :  let's just theme some maths things on Shakespeare and love triangles and so on. But as I investigated
*34:01.820- 34:07.920* :  and began searching his work for mathematical words and so on, just began to discover a rich
*34:07.920- 34:13.900* :  mathematical connection in the world around him which he mentions and refers to in various ways.
*34:14.060- 34:19.600* :  And you make the point that in a clever person of that age there wouldn't have been unusual.
*34:19.920- 34:24.900* :  I mean, you would have an understanding of things or an interest in things in the round much more
*34:25.440- 34:28.980* :  of a curiosity. I mean, he would not have had much of a maths education. He would have learnt
*34:28.980- 34:34.540* :  arithmetic. So his mathematics would have been very arithmetical, but then even mathematicians,
*34:34.640- 34:40.240* :  you know, arithmetic was quite a new and growing discipline. And that quote we heard from Henry
*34:40.240- 34:45.820* :  the fifth is really interesting because a wonderful discovery I made is that basically Shakespeare was
*34:45.820- 34:51.540* :  the first generation in England to have learned what we now call, well, our regular numerals,
*34:51.540- 34:55.500* :  the Indo-Arabic numerals, his dad would have been a Roman numerals guy and wouldn't have
*34:55.860- 35:00.720* :  recognised these things. What we now call zero, that word is a French word, zero, it hadn't
*35:00.720- 35:06.620* :  arrived in England. It was called the cipher and clearly Shakespeare is fascinated by the cipher
*35:07.280- 35:11.020* :  because it's a thing that represents nothing and yet it can make numbers really big. And so there
*35:11.020- 35:15.340* :  we are in Henry the fifth, basically saying there's only seven of us on the stage, but if one of us
*35:15.340- 35:19.560* :  is a one and the others are cipher zeros, we can make a million. Let's imagine we're a million.
*35:19.560- 35:25.920* :  And that it's his enjoyment too. I think so. And the way he plays with numbers that he will
*35:26.400- 35:31.040* :  instead of saying a hundred or 50, sorry, you'll say half a hundred or double five and 20,
*35:31.640- 35:36.220* :  and one of my favourite examples is in a fellow actually where Bianca is saying, oh,
*35:36.340- 35:40.840* :  Cassie, you've been away for a week, seven days, but she goes further and says, I want to say how many
*35:40.840- 35:45.200* :  hours it is. Now, I didn't know how many hours there are in a week, it's not commonly known,
*35:45.200- 35:52.960* :  it's 168, but Shakespeare doesn't say 168. He says eight score eight eight times 20 plus eight.
*35:52.960- 35:58.480* :  So not only has he worked it out, but he's made it poetic in it fits in three syllables,
*35:58.480- 36:03.500* :  it's beautiful. And he does this time and again, and it's just not something I think that anyone,
*36:03.500- 36:10.060* :  including me, would ever have thought about as him as a numbers guy. Shakespeare enthusiast Rob
*36:10.380- 36:18.220* :  author of much ado about numbers. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition

*36:58.960- 37:03.680* :  technically violates those honorists to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking
