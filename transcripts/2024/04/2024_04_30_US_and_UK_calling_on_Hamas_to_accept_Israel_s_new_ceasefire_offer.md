*01:28.480- 01:29.640* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:29.640- 01:32.900* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Tuesday, the 30th of April.
*01:33.420- 01:37.840* :  The US and Britain call on Hamas to accept the latest deal for a temporary ceasefire with
*01:37.840- 01:38.400* :  Israel.
*01:39.120- 01:43.720* :  The American State Department has found that five units of the Israeli military were responsible
*01:43.720- 01:47.000* :  for gross rights violations before the war in Gaza.
*01:47.840- 01:51.840* :  And the top clubs in English football have provisionally agreed a cap on spending.
*01:54.980- 02:00.420* :  Also in the podcast, 9 out of 10 of the highest grossing films of all time are two hours
*02:00.420- 02:01.060* :  or longer.
*02:01.540- 02:04.660* :  But what exactly is the ideal length for a film?
*02:05.100- 02:07.480* :  I'll give you a clue, it's not three hours.
*02:12.900- 02:18.920* :  Two months, Israel and Hamas have been negotiating indirectly over a hostage and ceasefire deal.
*02:19.100- 02:21.940* :  The previous one at the end of November lasted a week.
*02:22.620- 02:27.160* :  Since then, hopes of a new agreement have been raised and dashed several times.
*02:27.940- 02:31.740* :  Now with Gaza on the brink of famine and pressure building on the Israeli Prime Minister
*02:31.740- 02:36.640* :  to bring home the remaining hostages, there is optimism that a breakthrough could be near.
*02:36.640- 02:41.040* :  The US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, is currently holding talks in Saudi Arabia.
*02:41.540- 02:50.280* :  Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel.
*02:50.940- 02:55.920* :  And in this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is
*02:55.920- 02:56.260* :  Hamas.
*02:57.640- 03:00.320* :  They have to decide, and they have to decide quickly.
*03:01.180- 03:08.260* :  So we're looking to that, and I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision, and
*03:08.260- 03:11.200* :  we can have a fundamental change in the dynamic.
*03:11.860- 03:16.640* :  Hamas has said it has no major issues with the offer, which is said to include new wording
*03:16.640- 03:18.380* :  on a cessation of hostilities.
*03:19.160- 03:24.700* :  It has previously called for a permanent ceasefire, while Israel says it will continue fighting
*03:24.700- 03:29.780* :  until it has defeated Hamas, including fighters, hold up in Rafa.
*03:30.400- 03:33.320* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Frank Gardner, has the latest.
*03:33.920- 03:39.600* :  Not for the first time, there is a cautious sense of optimism, both here and in capitals
*03:39.600- 03:45.640* :  around the Middle East, that this isn't the end of the Gaza war, but there could be some kind
*03:45.640- 03:48.460* :  of a breakthrough in ceasefire talks.
*03:49.380- 03:49.620* :  Why?
*03:49.980- 03:53.940* :  Because for the first time, we're seeing some really quite considerable concessions being
*03:53.940- 03:54.540* :  talked about.
*03:54.980- 04:00.120* :  Nothing's firm yet, nothing's actually been publicized, signed, agreed, announced.
*04:00.700- 04:07.480* :  But what's being debated is the permission by the Israeli military for large numbers
*04:08.120- 04:13.340* :  of Palestinian displaced people, currently who are sheltering in the south of the Gaza
*04:13.340- 04:16.920* :  strip in the city of Rafa, to move back to their homes in the north.
*04:17.240- 04:19.660* :  That's something that Israel had resisted in the past.
*04:20.420- 04:25.060* :  Israel, reportedly, would also remove some of its forces from Gaza.
*04:25.860- 04:27.720* :  This will be during the 40-day truce.
*04:28.340- 04:35.860* :  And there would, of course, be the exchange of hostages and prisoners, probably hundreds,
*04:35.860- 04:41.420* :  if not thousands, of Palestinian prisoners coming out of Israeli jails, in return for
*04:41.420- 04:47.180* :  a rather lower figure than was originally demanded by Israel, an initial figure of around
*04:47.200- 04:49.620* :  33 Israeli hostages.
*04:50.180- 04:55.880* :  Now from the Israeli side, there is dual pressure going on here, pressure from the United States
*04:55.880- 05:02.840* :  to do this deal and pressure domestically from all the families and friends of the hostages
*05:03.340- 05:07.820* :  who have been demonstrating and shouting louder and louder against the government here, your
*05:07.820- 05:09.420* :  policy isn't working.
*05:09.960- 05:14.260* :  The Netanyahu government has always insisted that the only way to get all the best way to
*05:14.260- 05:19.580* :  get the hostages out is by military pressure, but it's not working, it's not producing any
*05:20.040- 05:20.060* :  results.
*05:20.520- 05:26.140* :  And they can see that, and every day that goes by increases the risk that more of those
*05:26.140- 05:28.860* :  hostages will die in one way or another.
*05:29.580- 05:37.340* :  So there is, as I say, this cautious optimism that this time it's possible that the differences
*05:37.340- 05:43.620* :  between the two sides, while not narrowed completely, are narrowing, and we might well
*05:43.620- 05:50.060* :  know the answers in the next 72 hours, whether this deal is going to fly or fail.
*05:50.740- 05:55.980* :  Our security correspondent Frank Gardner in Jerusalem and the Hamas delegation has now
*05:55.980- 06:01.720* :  left Egypt, and it says it's planning to return with a written response to the ceasefire
*06:01.720- 06:02.240* :  proposal.
*06:03.560- 06:08.860* :  As well as putting pressure on Israel over its actions in Gaza, the U.S. has also expressed
*06:08.860- 06:13.780* :  concern about the behavior of the Israeli military in the occupied West Bank.
*06:14.240- 06:18.820* :  Now following an investigation, the American State Department has concluded that some members
*06:18.820- 06:25.180* :  of the Israeli security forces have committed human rights violations before the war in Gaza.
*06:25.180- 06:27.980* :  Here's our State Department correspondent Tom Bateman.
*06:28.520- 06:32.420* :  In a first of its kind decision, the State Department says it has determined that five
*06:32.420- 06:37.220* :  units of the Israeli security forces carried out gross violations of human rights.
*06:37.720- 06:42.220* :  It hasn't detailed the incidents nor the units involved, but they are all believed to
*06:42.220- 06:47.120* :  have taken place in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem in recent years, but before the
*06:47.160- 06:48.140* :  current war in Gaza.
*06:48.720- 06:53.060* :  Under American law, such a finding means units can be barred from receiving U.S. military
*06:53.060- 06:58.100* :  assistance unless the State Department is satisfied the cases have been dealt with and
*06:58.100- 07:00.180* :  justice pursued by the country involved.
*07:00.680- 07:04.260* :  It says this has taken place with four of the five units.
*07:04.840- 07:09.800* :  While it was reportedly on the brink of cutting military aid to a fifth, it now says Israel
*07:09.800- 07:14.180* :  gave it new information, and it will make a decision after it consults with the Israeli
*07:14.180- 07:14.600* :  government.
*07:14.880- 07:19.320* :  The administration is denying accusations it's buckled under political pressure over
*07:19.320- 07:24.440* :  that case, widely reported to involve an IDF battalion which was investigated over the
*07:24.440- 07:30.520* :  death two years ago of an 80-year-old Palestinian-American man who was bound and gagged by soldiers
*07:30.520- 07:31.740* :  during a village search.
*07:32.520- 07:34.280* :  Tom Bateman in Washington.
*07:35.340- 07:40.200* :  Meanwhile, the U.S. has singled out the United Arab Emirates among a group of countries
*07:40.200- 07:45.120* :  it says must stop providing support to the warring military factions in Sudan.
*07:46.180- 07:51.740* :  America's UN envoy said the Sudanese army and the rival RSF militia were both receiving
*07:51.740- 07:56.400* :  support, which was leading to the destruction of Sudan and the displacement of millions.
*07:56.420- 07:58.860* :  Here's our Africa Regional Editor, Will Ross.
*07:59.240- 08:03.840* :  The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. said history was repeating itself in Darfur in the worst
*08:03.840- 08:04.680* :  possible way.
*08:04.700- 08:08.840* :  Linda Thomas Greenfield was referring to the ethnically-driven killings that took place
*08:08.840- 08:11.580* :  two decades ago in this region in the west of Sudan.
*08:12.120- 08:16.900* :  She said once again, villages near Al-Fasha were being raised to the ground by the RSF and
*08:16.900- 08:20.500* :  its allied militias and warned of an imminent attack on the whole city.
*08:20.980- 08:25.240* :  American officials hope they can persuade the United Arab Emirates to stop backing the
*08:25.240- 08:25.860* :  RSF.
*08:26.160- 08:28.580* :  The U.S. ally has denied giving the support.
*08:29.160- 08:34.100* :  Eight million people have been displaced in Sudan and so far all efforts at peace talks
*08:34.100- 08:34.900* :  have failed.
*08:35.500- 08:36.060* :  Will Ross.
*08:36.060- 08:41.420* :  Well, next to Kenya and as we record this podcast, the authorities there say at least 50 people
*08:41.420- 08:43.700* :  have died after a damn collapsed.
*08:43.740- 08:48.820* :  Tarantial rainfall washed away part of a village and the number of dead is expected to rise.
*08:49.120- 08:55.200* :  The Red Cross has its rescued more than 100 people, at least 130,000 people have been
*08:55.200- 09:00.120* :  displaced by flooding across Kenya as the region is hit by a severe rainy season.
*09:00.120- 09:03.720* :  A Kenyakara-spondent Barbara Plattasha reports from the scene.
*09:07.200- 09:09.520* :  The group of men is trying to move a battered car.
*09:10.060- 09:14.860* :  It's stuck in the mud next to a gouged-out river bank in a place where houses used to stand.
*09:15.800- 09:20.620* :  A roaring sound woke people here at three o'clock in the morning as a tide of water crashed
*09:20.620- 09:22.520* :  down from a burst dam upriver.
*09:25.980- 09:30.340* :  Ted and Moirori said before he had time to think, he was up to his neck and water.
*09:30.740- 09:34.700* :  He saw the flood take his wife and was swept in the opposite direction.
*09:35.360- 09:38.440* :  But he was able to grab a tree branch and hang on.
*09:38.840- 09:40.220* :  Many others weren't so fortunate.
*09:40.260- 09:45.740* :  Peter Moiningi said he spent a frantic night trying to pull people out of the flood or
*09:45.740- 09:48.680* :  digging them out of the mud and the branches of broken trees.
*09:48.980- 09:53.860* :  The little babies in the water, all the people and people are screaming, people are crying,
*09:54.380- 09:57.840* :  people are losing their lives, people are losing their loved ones.
*09:57.840- 10:01.860* :  The rain started again mid-afternoon and the forecast is for Moir.
*10:02.380- 10:07.120* :  What happened here was a disaster, but government officials have warned that dams in other parts
*10:07.120- 10:11.760* :  of the country are full to the brim, they're telling people they need to be prepared to move
*10:11.760- 10:12.280* :  quickly.
*10:12.660- 10:14.780* :  Barbara Plattasha in central Kenya.
*10:14.780- 10:20.320* :  For more on the rescue operation Paul Henley spoke to Michael Iayaba, head of disaster management
*10:20.320- 10:21.780* :  at the Kenyan Red Cross.
*10:22.520- 10:24.700* :  First he spoke about conditions in the area.
*10:25.240- 10:31.760* :  Nairobi and this surrounding west highlands of Rift Valley have been receiving lots of
*10:31.760- 10:40.560* :  rain in excess of even 50 millimeters within 24 hours and this has been consistent over
*10:40.560- 10:41.720* :  the last one week.
*10:42.280- 10:48.280* :  Now what this has caused is that the soils have become saturated and could most likely
*10:48.280- 10:56.260* :  be the reason that led to that dam finally breaking its bank and lots of water running
*10:56.260- 10:59.640* :  downstream in excess of 100 meters.
*11:00.160- 11:07.920* :  And therefore, water gained lots of acceleration, sweeping a village into the town of Maimau
*11:08.340- 11:13.620* :  where it has caused high fatalities, such and rescue efforts are in place.
*11:14.180- 11:19.740* :  The survivors have been taken to hospital with government agencies working with the Red Cross
*11:20.240- 11:21.540* :  all together in this.
*11:21.880- 11:26.460* :  And you have Red Cross people on the ground, what are they saying the scene looks like now?
*11:27.120- 11:34.380* :  The water levels seem to have gone down, but lots of debris all over, meaning you cannot
*11:34.380- 11:41.580* :  clearly see whether in some sections you have people or not, they can see images that
*11:41.580- 11:47.840* :  they've sent from ground of vehicles that have been swept off and damaged by debris that
*11:47.880- 11:55.120* :  ran into them and you could even see some furniture that was also swept by this heavy
*11:55.400- 11:56.060* :  flood water.
*11:56.680- 12:00.020* :  It's quite early to say how many people would have been there.
*12:00.020- 12:06.060* :  We've opened up missing persons registration desk for those who will report that their
*12:06.060- 12:07.220* :  loved ones are missing.
*12:07.500- 12:11.120* :  And I know these aren't even the first deadly floods in Kenya this month.
*12:11.140- 12:15.040* :  The country's been experiencing unprecedented rainfall, hasn't it?
*12:15.040- 12:17.980* :  Lake Victoria is overflowing effectively.
*12:18.300- 12:24.800* :  Sure, and remember, Lake Victoria gets water from the other East African countries, including
*12:25.500- 12:29.500* :  Uganda and Tanzania that are also experiencing heavy rains.
*12:30.100- 12:36.020* :  Lake levels have gone up, meaning more displacements of population happening.
*12:36.560- 12:41.980* :  And what we also saw yesterday in one of the towns, Homa Bay, bordering the lake, there
*12:41.980- 12:47.360* :  was a flood coming from highlands and it swept through houses.
*12:48.000- 12:51.040* :  We have fatalities there and displacements.
*12:51.040- 12:56.760* :  So we are also dealing with such and rescue mission on that end.
*12:57.360- 13:02.940* :  On the eastern part of Kenya, we also have Tanariva where we have check dams which are
*13:02.940- 13:08.320* :  used for electricity generation, but they are also full and therefore all the water from
*13:08.320- 13:12.520* :  the highlands is now going down and displacing lots of population.
*13:12.580- 13:15.760* :  Unfortunately yesterday we had a boat that capsized.
*13:16.280- 13:22.220* :  We have found three bodies reducing the number of those who were missing to 17.
*13:22.980- 13:24.340* :  Do you need more foreign help?
*13:24.640- 13:31.620* :  We need support for shelter, water treatment, food, especially for these people because
*13:31.620- 13:35.380* :  they lose everything and plants for resettlement.
*13:36.040- 13:44.380* :  Most of them are actually in schools and churches and there are not enough for kind of population
*13:44.440- 13:45.260* :  that we are seeing.
*13:45.740- 13:49.840* :  Michael I.E.R. Bay head of disaster management for the Kenyan Red Cross.
*13:50.840- 13:55.340* :  The Mona Lisa, arguably the world's most famous painting, could get a room of its own
*13:55.340- 13:56.540* :  in the Louvre in Paris.
*13:57.000- 14:01.220* :  After the museum's president said visitors deserve the best possible experience.
*14:01.960- 14:06.500* :  So will the nine million people who flock to see Da Vinci's masterpiece agree this is
*14:06.560- 14:07.160* :  an improvement.
*14:07.160- 14:10.980* :  Paul Henley spoke to art, critic and lecturer Esther Loveatt.
*14:11.620- 14:12.860* :  What does she think of it being moved?
*14:13.340- 14:17.800* :  I think it's perfect timing now, especially as Paris is going to be hosting the Olympic
*14:17.800- 14:18.760* :  Games this summer.
*14:18.840- 14:23.000* :  So they're counting on inundated football at the Louvre.
*14:23.060- 14:28.960* :  But it's also good PR, you know, everybody has heard of the Mona Lisa.
*14:29.240- 14:31.980* :  She's the rock star of the Renaissance art world.
*14:32.060- 14:37.160* :  She's got a fandom, it's almost like being Taylor Swift or Madonna, everybody wants to
*14:37.160- 14:41.020* :  see her and everybody wants to have a selfie taken with her.
*14:41.140- 14:46.380* :  And that's one of the disappointing things, actually, as of experienced four visitors.
*14:46.800- 14:52.560* :  You've got the Mona Lisa, which is very small, actually, the late Queen of France, Mary
*14:52.560- 14:57.300* :  Antoinette, back in the 18th century, said that the Mona Lisa is far too small and too
*14:57.300- 14:57.580* :  dark.
*14:58.120- 15:04.020* :  And now that we've got all these visitors and she's behind Bulletproof glass, anti-reflective
*15:04.020- 15:06.480* :  glass, it's very difficult to see her.
*15:06.620- 15:10.220* :  It's her enigmatic smile that's been idolized by art lovers.
*15:10.300- 15:15.380* :  So the chance to see it in a new location, given that she'll be given her own basement
*15:15.380- 15:15.840* :  room.
*15:16.200- 15:20.660* :  I'm not really surprised because she actually has her own mailbox, she gets delivered
*15:20.660- 15:23.140* :  love letters and bouquets of flowers.
*15:23.480- 15:29.120* :  I suppose the essential question is whether it will make it more difficult funneling the
*15:29.120- 15:33.900* :  huge numbers of visitors in and out of a single room, it's already highly regimented,
*15:33.900- 15:34.320* :  isn't it?
*15:34.480- 15:36.100* :  That's a very good question, Paul, yes.
*15:36.460- 15:41.300* :  You can wait in a queue for two hours to see her if you're lucky for eight seconds, but
*15:41.380- 15:47.980* :  there will be an entrance for visitors to bypass the current glass pyramid entrance and
*15:47.980- 15:52.180* :  go directly to the underground room that is devoted for her.
*15:52.320- 15:55.900* :  You know, it's quite extraordinary, really, does she need her own space?
*15:55.900- 16:02.800* :  At the moment, she is sharing the gallery room with other 16th century Venetian artists
*16:02.800- 16:05.320* :  who have very big works of art.
*16:05.840- 16:08.000* :  So I think it's a good idea to try it.
*16:08.000- 16:15.440* :  I can't say that visitors will enjoy it anymore, but they will be able to say I was there for
*16:15.440- 16:18.920* :  this current hashtag FOMO fear of missing out on it.
*16:19.000- 16:22.280* :  Just in a few words, Estelle, is she worth it?
*16:22.280- 16:27.840* :  Why do you think as an art critic would you say that the quality of the painting merits
*16:27.840- 16:28.860* :  this level of fame?
*16:29.100- 16:35.040* :  Well, Davinci himself said it wasn't his best painting, you know, it is valued at something
*16:35.040- 16:40.420* :  like $800 million, but it's priceless, so you can't really put a price on it.
*16:40.500- 16:45.960* :  It's not his greatest, no, but don't forget he was more interested in science and invention
*16:45.960- 16:47.660* :  than he was in painting.
*16:48.540- 16:51.020* :  Art critic and lecturer Estelle love it.
*16:53.760- 16:55.680* :  And still to come on the global news podcast.
*16:55.780- 17:03.820* :  In 2015, I went out in Amsterdam and then I had to pee with all the bars and cafes and
*17:03.820- 17:05.220* :  all the other places were closed.
*17:05.220- 17:07.420* :  I searched for a alley.
*17:08.140- 17:12.380* :  A victory for women in Amsterdam after the city authorities announced they're spending
*17:12.380- 17:14.700* :  millions on more public toilets.
*17:24.260- 17:24.980* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*17:24.980- 17:28.940* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*17:29.140- 17:31.600* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*17:31.940- 17:36.400* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided
*17:36.400- 17:39.320* :  to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*17:39.640- 17:43.960* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15
*17:43.980- 17:44.620* :  a month.

*18:23.520- 18:26.800* :  The number one financial destination Yahoo Finance dot com.
*18:29.700- 18:36.240* :  It was one of the most destructive wildfires Greece has ever seen.
*18:36.240- 18:41.780* :  In 2018, flames swept through the seaside town of Matty, leaving more than 100 people
*18:41.780- 18:42.160* :  dead.
*18:42.680- 18:44.920* :  But it wasn't simply a natural disaster.
*18:44.920- 18:50.000* :  A report found a catalogue of official failures and now six people have been convicted
*18:50.300- 18:50.800* :  over the blaze.
*18:50.840- 18:53.720* :  I heard more from my Europe regional editor, Paul Moss.
*18:54.340- 18:59.520* :  The summer of 2018 saw terrible heat wave across Europe with lots of wildfires.
*19:00.140- 19:04.460* :  But the worst of these were in July in the coastal area around the Greek capital Athens.
*19:04.460- 19:07.860* :  They were accompanied by high winds which meant they spread very quickly.
*19:08.660- 19:11.000* :  And the worst hit was this resort town of Matty.
*19:11.000- 19:11.380* :  What happened?
*19:11.660- 19:12.720* :  There was truly horrible.
*19:12.780- 19:14.220* :  I mean, it happened so fast.
*19:14.780- 19:16.740* :  Many people burned to death in their homes.
*19:17.300- 19:19.100* :  Some ran into the sea and drowned.
*19:19.200- 19:21.780* :  Rescuers found 26 corpses together.
*19:22.300- 19:24.720* :  Apparently, they were all hugging each other as they died.
*19:25.340- 19:29.740* :  Now right from the start, there are complaints that this death toll did not need to have
*19:29.740- 19:30.600* :  been so high.
*19:30.960- 19:33.000* :  People complained that there had been no warning.
*19:33.460- 19:37.760* :  There were really horrible allegations that one point drivers were being directed to flee
*19:38.180- 19:42.020* :  towards an area already on fire and they burned to death in their cars.
*19:42.800- 19:46.340* :  And an official report, less than a year later, confirmed many of these allegations.
*19:46.340- 19:51.020* :  It said there had been mismanagement by the police and the fire service as a lack of coordination
*19:51.020- 19:54.280* :  which had caused chaos and a collapse of the system.
*19:54.720- 19:59.860* :  And it referred to criminal mistakes, hence the trial which ended in Athens on Monday.
*20:00.140- 20:01.920* :  Yeah, and what happened in court?
*20:02.180- 20:06.740* :  There were 21 people on trial, a local governor, other figures from local government, officials
*20:06.740- 20:11.500* :  from the emergency services, also a man who'd been burning wood in his garden and was said
*20:11.500- 20:13.040* :  to have started one of the fires.
*20:13.520- 20:19.520* :  Now of these 21-6 were found guilty, five officials for involuntary manslaughter and negligence.
*20:19.520- 20:24.140* :  The man who was burning wood in his garden, he was found guilty of involuntary arson.
*20:24.680- 20:29.660* :  They were given various prison sentences, some of them suspended, but this is, I suppose,
*20:29.660- 20:35.000* :  a strange aspect of the Greek legal system, all six of them were let off going to prison
*20:35.000- 20:40.820* :  in return for paying a fine and crucially of those 21, all of the local government people
*20:40.820- 20:42.500* :  on trial, they were all acquitted.
*20:42.680- 20:45.200* :  Yeah, and the families are very unhappy about it.
*20:45.200- 20:45.800* :  They really were.
*20:45.800- 20:48.240* :  I mean, as those verdicts came out, they yelled out shame.
*20:48.240- 20:49.980* :  They said justice hadn't been done.
*20:50.660- 20:55.520* :  One shouted, your court is an insult to the dead, a lot of people just broke down and
*20:55.780- 20:56.200* :  sobbed.
*20:56.240- 21:00.040* :  Now, family representatives said they're going to try and get some of these acquittals
*21:00.040- 21:06.320* :  overturned on appeal and the sentences toughened, but whether there's actually going to be possible,
*21:06.320- 21:08.380* :  I think, at this stage, it's still unclear.
*21:08.820- 21:10.560* :  Are your original editor, Paul Moss?
*21:11.320- 21:17.320* :  Football now, and according to the book Socconomics, there is a direct relationship between a club's
*21:17.320- 21:22.940* :  wage bill and its position in the English Premier League, put simply the more a team pays
*21:22.940- 21:24.680* :  its players, the better it does.
*21:25.160- 21:29.740* :  Now, in an attempt to keep the Premiership competitive, clubs have agreed in principle
*21:29.740- 21:34.300* :  to back a spending cap, as I heard from our senior sports news reporter, Laura Scott.
*21:34.620- 21:41.860* :  What this would be is another financial control to effectively tie the spending power of any
*21:41.860- 21:49.440* :  club to the percentage, basically a multiple, of the television revenue and prize money
*21:49.440- 21:51.120* :  of the lowest earning side.
*21:51.620- 21:57.720* :  So effectively, all of the clubs would be governed by the same upper limit, or salary
*21:57.720- 22:01.840* :  cap or spending cap, although this is being termed anchoring.
*22:02.520- 22:04.100* :  It isn't yet in force.
*22:04.100- 22:10.820* :  What they've agreed to today is to further explore the potential to introduce this kind
*22:10.820- 22:16.480* :  of model, so they've basically given permission for the Premier League to do the final financial
*22:16.480- 22:20.520* :  and legal analysis that's required for the model and draw up the rules.
*22:21.120- 22:26.480* :  Those would then be voted on potentially in June at the Premier League's AGM.
*22:27.000- 22:32.660* :  So we're still quite a long way from this spending cap being introduced, but today is
*22:32.660- 22:37.840* :  a significant moment because you've got 16 of the 20 Premier League clubs saying, actually,
*22:37.840- 22:42.720* :  yes, you can go on and develop this potential model ready for a vote.
*22:43.000- 22:49.140* :  So what would that mean for teams like Manchester City and Newcastle with Rich Owners?
*22:49.580- 22:54.060* :  Well, we know that Manchester United are one of the clubs who voted against developing
*22:54.060- 22:59.280* :  these proposals today, Newcastle, seemingly in favour of at least exploring the opportunity.
*23:00.120- 23:05.320* :  Theoretically, what it's meant to do is try to level out the competitiveness of the Premier League.
*23:05.320- 23:11.020* :  We are anticipating that Manchester City will win a fourth Premier League title in a row.
*23:11.020- 23:12.960* :  Well, is that a competitive league?
*23:13.560- 23:14.680* :  You know, that is up for discussion.
*23:15.160- 23:19.280* :  But then what they don't want to do is stifle Premier League clubs' abilities
*23:19.800- 23:21.640* :  to compete with their European counterparts.
*23:21.640- 23:25.780* :  And that is the opposition that you get from the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City,
*23:25.780- 23:29.300* :  and Aston Villa, which are that if you put everyone on the same cap,
*23:29.820- 23:31.320* :  you are stifling their ambition.
*23:31.780- 23:35.120* :  You're actually punishing people who've grown their revenues over the last few years,
*23:35.820- 23:38.540* :  and that's not a way to run a competitive league.
*23:38.780- 23:39.520* :  Laura Scott.
*23:40.520- 23:43.360* :  Now, he's one of the world's most popular yoga gurus,
*23:43.360- 23:48.080* :  but Baba Ramdev has fallen foul of the courts in India over misleading adverts
*23:48.080- 23:50.040* :  about his traditional medicine products.
*23:50.760- 23:54.040* :  He has more than 10 million subscribers to his YouTube channel
*23:54.040- 23:57.020* :  where he promotes his remedies often while doing yoga.
*24:01.620- 24:06.480* :  Regulators have now suspended manufacturing licenses for 14 of his products,
*24:06.480- 24:09.900* :  including traditional medicines for asthma, bronchitis, and diabetes.
*24:10.760- 24:13.960* :  South Asia, editor Anne Bereson, editor Rajan, takes up the story.
*24:14.340- 24:18.420* :  Well, he's very well known in India for his TV shows
*24:18.420- 24:25.720* :  where he was promoting various Ayurveda products produced by his pharmaceutical companies.
*24:26.340- 24:29.500* :  As you know, in India, the traditional medicine is very popular.
*24:30.040- 24:33.400* :  You know, in the absence of health centers and rural areas,
*24:33.400- 24:36.760* :  people have long been using these traditional medicines,
*24:36.760- 24:39.820* :  and that's where Baba Ramdev came into picture
*24:39.820- 24:45.180* :  by producing several products which he claimed can cure various illnesses.
*24:45.960- 24:48.240* :  And that led to controversy over the years.
*24:48.400- 24:50.080* :  Now, you know, this has caught on.
*24:50.080- 24:52.240* :  The imagination are people are buying,
*24:52.240- 24:56.560* :  and it is now it's believed to be his worth more than two to three billion dollars
*24:56.560- 24:58.980* :  according to Indian media reports,
*24:58.980- 25:02.500* :  and they sell ranging from toothpaste to various products.
*25:03.160- 25:06.800* :  And he really got into trouble when during COVID crisis,
*25:07.380- 25:09.600* :  when he launched a tablet coronally,
*25:09.600- 25:12.060* :  saying that it will cure the COVID virus.
*25:12.060- 25:16.580* :  And many doctors in the Indian Medical Association were livid with anger.
*25:16.580- 25:18.520* :  You know, this was not tested properly.
*25:19.180- 25:23.300* :  And how can this cure when, you know, so many global companies were working
*25:23.300- 25:25.560* :  for months to produce your vaccine?
*25:26.160- 25:30.860* :  And now the state of Uttarakhand has now suspended licenses
*25:30.860- 25:35.100* :  for 14 of the products made by the companies of Baba Ramdev.
*25:35.580- 25:38.740* :  And some of them, you know, which the companies claim
*25:38.740- 25:42.080* :  that they could cure bronchitis, asthma, undiabetes.
*25:42.700- 25:45.560* :  Now, this follows a Supreme Court directive,
*25:45.580- 25:50.060* :  which clearly said that he should apologize for misleading people.
*25:50.060- 25:53.680* :  And also it pulled up the authorities for not taking action against
*25:53.700- 25:57.100* :  what the court said were misleading claims of Mr Ramdev.
*25:57.360- 26:00.800* :  Because the Supreme Court has repeatedly criticized him
*26:00.800- 26:03.180* :  for not complying with its directive.
*26:03.180- 26:04.640* :  So what happens next?
*26:04.800- 26:08.860* :  The court has asked him to issue apology on the newspapers,
*26:08.980- 26:12.740* :  saying that most of his claims were misleading.
*26:13.340- 26:15.000* :  In fact, he gave a very small advertisement.
*26:15.000- 26:18.300* :  So the court again told him give a bigger advertisement,
*26:18.300- 26:19.440* :  giving his apology.
*26:20.000- 26:22.920* :  So the court case will come up for hearing in the next few weeks
*26:22.920- 26:24.340* :  and then the judges will decide
*26:24.340- 26:26.280* :  what would be the next course of action.
*26:26.920- 26:30.160* :  And Barassan Etirajana South Asia Regional Editor.
*26:30.940- 26:32.980* :  Next to a victory for those battling
*26:32.980- 26:36.040* :  for so-called urination equality in the Netherlands.
*26:36.800- 26:38.180* :  The city of Amsterdam has announced
*26:38.180- 26:41.440* :  it is to spend millions on lots more public toilets
*26:42.040- 26:44.460* :  to complement the relatively plentiful supply
*26:44.460- 26:46.880* :  of urinals already in place for men.
*26:46.880- 26:49.780* :  It's a story which began back in 2015.
*26:50.440- 26:53.960* :  When he had a peoning, then age 21 was on her way home
*26:54.380- 26:55.760* :  and the need struck.
*26:55.760- 26:57.360* :  She spoke to Tim Franks.
*26:57.820- 27:00.800* :  In 2015, I went out in Amsterdam.
*27:01.000- 27:02.300* :  It was in the middle of the night.
*27:03.100- 27:06.660* :  And then I had to pee with all the bars and cafes
*27:06.660- 27:08.440* :  and all the other places were closed.
*27:08.900- 27:11.280* :  And then I couldn't make it to home anymore.
*27:11.280- 27:13.680* :  Yeah, I searched for a alley.
*27:14.040- 27:17.160* :  And then I got caught because I was peeing in public.
*27:18.080- 27:19.360* :  And then I got fined.
*27:19.700- 27:20.940* :  So that's where it all started.
*27:21.340- 27:24.880* :  So you were fined by the police who happened to spot you.
*27:25.440- 27:26.120* :  What happened then?
*27:26.300- 27:29.400* :  Did you decide, look, this is completely unfair.
*27:29.400- 27:31.160* :  I'm not going to pay it.
*27:31.240- 27:33.060* :  I'm going to take this to court.
*27:33.340- 27:36.480* :  Actually, I got the fin and next morning I woke up
*27:36.500- 27:38.540* :  and I thought it is really weird
*27:39.100- 27:40.880* :  because I really couldn't find a toilet.
*27:41.300- 27:42.780* :  And then I did a little research.
*27:43.460- 27:47.200* :  And I found out that there were 35 toilets for men
*27:47.700- 27:51.580* :  and just two public toilets for everyone else in the whole city.
*27:52.120- 27:54.260* :  And then I thought this isn't really fair.
*27:54.560- 27:55.760* :  And then I thought the fine.
*27:56.600- 27:59.620* :  And then two years later, I had to go to court for that.
*27:59.980- 28:02.240* :  Gosh, so it took two years before we came to court.
*28:02.880- 28:05.100* :  And then what happened in court?
*28:05.140- 28:08.540* :  Because I mean, that is part of the story, isn't it?
*28:09.800- 28:11.280* :  Yes, that is part of the story.
*28:11.280- 28:14.120* :  So I was in court and then the judge told me
*28:14.120- 28:17.140* :  that I could have peed on a man's urinal.
*28:17.140- 28:22.040* :  I mean, presumably you didn't laugh in court.
*28:22.240- 28:25.720* :  But I mean, you must have been, frankly, remarkable thing
*28:25.720- 28:30.000* :  for somebody to say who sort of you imagine
*28:30.000- 28:33.020* :  would understand female anatomy to a point.
*28:34.440- 28:36.280* :  Yes, I did not laugh at all.
*28:36.280- 28:38.280* :  But I also didn't know what to say.
*28:38.280- 28:40.300* :  So I didn't say anything.
*28:40.300- 28:43.480* :  But tell me how we've got to the point today.
*28:43.480- 28:46.740* :  Because I mean, it's taken a very, very long time.
*28:46.740- 28:50.200* :  But how has your campaign worked?
*28:50.760- 28:53.100* :  Yeah, we're seven years after court now.
*28:53.760- 28:55.800* :  I lost the case in the end.
*28:56.140- 28:59.280* :  But then after a year, I thought, OK, nothing happened yet.
*28:59.560- 29:02.680* :  So I had contact with someone from the municipality,
*29:02.680- 29:05.380* :  from a political party, Ilan Arota Kerk.
*29:05.540- 29:05.880* :  Yes.
*29:06.060- 29:09.480* :  You started your campaign saying, look, we need,
*29:09.480- 29:15.080* :  we need urination equality as the campaign has been talked about.
*29:15.560- 29:19.240* :  So, I mean, at last, long, long, last nine years
*29:19.240- 29:22.080* :  after this incident, the Amsterdam authorities
*29:22.080- 29:24.800* :  say that they will build more toilets
*29:24.800- 29:28.680* :  that are accessible for people with wheelchairs and for women.
*29:29.140- 29:30.460* :  So it is a victory.
*29:31.020- 29:32.140* :  Yes, it's happening.
*29:33.440- 29:35.840* :  Yeah, they are going to build the first one in October.
*29:35.840- 29:38.440* :  So that's, yeah, a great thing, I think.
*29:39.100- 29:42.040* :  Here to be talking to Tim Franks.
*29:42.740- 29:45.620* :  Now, what is the ideal length for a film?
*29:45.860- 29:48.120* :  Well, recently we've seen some box office hits
*29:48.120- 29:51.240* :  like Oppenheimer coming in at a whopping three hours.
*29:52.000- 29:53.640* :  But new research in the US suggests
*29:53.640- 29:56.680* :  that viewers would have been happier if it had been cut in half.
*29:57.020- 29:58.680* :  Our reporter Stephanie Prentice told me
*29:58.680- 30:02.780* :  the ideal duration for moviegoers seems to be about 90 minutes.
*30:03.240- 30:06.400* :  According to this poll, Oli, it was 2000 Americans they pulled.
*30:06.420- 30:09.440* :  They were trying to work out at what point people just switch off
*30:09.660- 30:10.700* :  when they're watching a film.
*30:10.700- 30:13.480* :  And they did conclude it's around an hour and a half.
*30:13.680- 30:15.120* :  And actually, according to the study,
*30:15.600- 30:18.940* :  only 2% of the people they surveyed would have been happy
*30:18.940- 30:22.160* :  if a film went on longer than two and a half hours.
*30:22.740- 30:24.280* :  Now, this issue actually came out recently
*30:24.280- 30:27.580* :  with the Martin Scorsese Western killers of the flower moon.
*30:28.120- 30:29.040* :  That got a lot of hype.
*30:29.040- 30:30.680* :  People were really excited about it.
*30:30.880- 30:33.980* :  But the final cut is three and a half hours long.
*30:33.980- 30:37.140* :  And some cinemas said they were responding to audience feedback
*30:37.140- 30:39.240* :  and putting in an intermission in the middle.
*30:39.660- 30:42.080* :  Martin Scorsese himself shook off criticism of the length
*30:42.080- 30:43.860* :  saying gives cinema some respect.
*30:44.360- 30:47.240* :  Yeah, I mean, I'm happier for films about 90 minutes long,
*30:47.280- 30:49.960* :  but some hits have broken this rule.
*30:50.100- 30:52.680* :  Well, yeah, in terms of pure box office statistics,
*30:52.740- 30:54.760* :  this new data doesn't really add up
*30:54.760- 30:58.360* :  because 9 out of 10 of the highest grossing films of all time
*30:58.640- 30:59.880* :  are two hours or longer.
*30:59.880- 31:02.500* :  And even adjusted for only US audiences,
*31:02.880- 31:06.160* :  the data shows they're still turning out for those longer movies.
*31:06.880- 31:08.320* :  If we think of something like Avatar,
*31:08.540- 31:10.200* :  that's the highest grossing film of all time,
*31:10.200- 31:12.540* :  made around $3 billion globally,
*31:12.580- 31:15.580* :  that's more than two and a half hours long,
*31:16.140- 31:17.740* :  Titanic, more than three hours.
*31:18.260- 31:20.460* :  In fact, if you'll make your way down the list
*31:20.460- 31:22.580* :  of the most successful films in the world,
*31:22.580- 31:25.500* :  you have to get to millions at number 26.
*31:25.500- 31:29.380* :  And that's the first one that hits that 90-minute mark.
*31:30.020- 31:31.280* :  And if you think a little bit differently
*31:31.280- 31:33.720* :  in terms of things like cultural footprint,
*31:34.140- 31:35.820* :  you've got those massive epic classics
*31:35.820- 31:38.700* :  like Lawrence of Arabia or Gone With The Wind,
*31:39.000- 31:41.560* :  and they're more than three and a half hours long,
*31:41.560- 31:43.300* :  but I mean, could you sit through them?
*31:43.560- 31:44.400* :  To be honest, I haven't.
*31:44.420- 31:45.720* :  I am put off by the length.
*31:46.400- 31:46.980* :  I'm understandable.
*31:47.500- 31:48.700* :  But you've actually seen?
*31:49.040- 31:49.660* :  I have indeed.
*31:49.660- 31:50.660* :  I've seen Gone With The Wind.
*31:50.660- 31:51.220* :  I've enjoyed it.
*31:51.260- 31:52.800* :  I've actually watched it more than once.
*31:52.800- 31:55.480* :  So I think I also would contradict this data as well.
*31:55.480- 31:56.540* :  I think I'd bed in.
*31:56.980- 32:00.680* :  I am still convinced that less is more Stephanie Princess there.
*32:03.120- 32:04.540* :  And that's all from us for now,
*32:04.540- 32:07.160* :  but the global news podcast will be back very soon.

*32:28.700- 32:30.320* :  From people who chased their dreams,
*32:30.320- 32:33.000* :  no one knew that I was going to travel by bike.
*32:33.340- 32:35.960* :  If I had told them that I was riding it back to Egypt,
*32:36.520- 32:38.640* :  they might have said that it was impossible
*32:39.000- 32:41.060* :  to people who've lived through nightmares.
*32:41.460- 32:42.960* :  Been in jail in Thailand.
*32:42.960- 32:45.660* :  I made a promise to myself in that jail
*32:45.940- 32:48.460* :  that when I'm home, I'm going to volunteer somewhere.
