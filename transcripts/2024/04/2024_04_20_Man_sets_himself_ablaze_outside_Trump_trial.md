*01:27.880- 01:30.540* :  I'm Nick Keraci, and in the early hours of Saturday,
*01:30.540- 01:32.700* :  the 20th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:33.120- 01:36.840* :  He's on fire, another area in the park with some of the accelerants

*01:56.900- 02:00.560* :  in missiles last weekend, but what might happen next?
*02:01.280- 02:08.020* :  And we're seeing around 20 deaths and around 15 hospitalizations per day.
*02:08.020- 02:11.080* :  Around the country, it would exceed hundreds.
*02:11.640- 02:15.600* :  Malians struggling to survive in scorching heat wave.
*02:18.440- 02:23.200* :  Also in this podcast, why has President Xi unveiled a new cybeforce in China?
*02:23.900- 02:29.020* :  And the American football star who lost his super bowl ring in a pool of chili?
*02:29.520- 02:33.200* :  Somebody at some point messed with my super bowl ring, which I'm fine with.
*02:33.420- 02:35.640* :  I mean, it's just a hunk of metal. I'll just have another one made, I think.
*02:36.260- 02:36.860* :  Thank you to do that, right?
*02:37.500- 02:40.260* :  Reality dawns on Jason Keraci.
*02:45.400- 02:49.800* :  There were frightening scenes near 100 Centre Street court house in New York.
*02:49.800- 02:55.260* :  The venue where Donald Trump is going on trial, a man set himself a blaze in a park with a fire
*02:55.260- 03:00.480* :  accelerant throwing pamphlets in the air, which the police described as conspiracy-based.
*03:00.480- 03:05.160* :  He's been named as Maxwell as a relo. The FPN, why the New York fire patrol,
*03:05.160- 03:08.340* :  responded quickly as did the police, Jeffrey Madrie.
*03:08.840- 03:12.880* :  The chief of the city's police department spoke to reporters about what happened to the man.
*03:13.220- 03:17.240* :  He's on fire, another area in the park where some of the accelerants spilled
*03:17.240- 03:22.200* :  is also on fire. Civilians, court officers, members of the police department,
*03:22.200- 03:25.920* :  they make efforts to put him out. They use their coats, flags,
*03:25.920- 03:31.060* :  thingwishes, eventually FDNY. We're able to put the mail, it's
*03:31.060- 03:36.220* :  thingwish to a fire. And from that point, we will remove him to a Cornell burn unit where right now
*03:36.220- 03:39.440* :  he's there in a critical condition.
*03:39.800- 03:44.780* :  Well, all jurors have now been chosen for Donald Trump's trial, the first criminal trial of
*03:44.780- 03:50.340* :  a former or sitting US president. He denies falsifying accounts to hide a hush money payment to
*03:50.340- 03:56.640* :  the porn star Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. She said this was to keep
*03:56.640- 04:01.820* :  her quiet about an affair she had with Mr. Trump, the claim he rejects. A correspondent,
*04:01.840- 04:06.460* :  Nedda Talfique, was at the scene in New York when the man set himself on fire.
*04:06.940- 04:11.220* :  Can tell you that the park is just a few feet in front of where I am right now directly
*04:11.220- 04:15.800* :  across from this courthouse and you can still see officers there, the investigation ongoing.
*04:15.820- 04:22.120* :  But the press were here. We had just gone word around 130 that jury selection was complete.
*04:22.840- 04:29.740* :  When you could see and hear the commotion as that young man walked into the park through
*04:30.320- 04:37.380* :  the pamphlets in the air and set himself on fire, many hear screaming at that scene,
*04:37.380- 04:44.080* :  calling out for a fire extinguisher. And it took about two minutes for police to get around
*04:44.200- 04:51.780* :  into the park to him to try to put the fire out. He is in hospital now in critical condition.
*04:51.940- 04:58.640* :  And what we heard from police in that update is that he is a male that was born in 1987
*04:58.640- 05:04.840* :  from St. Augustine, Florida. So he had recently arrived in New York. His car was last seen in Florida
*05:04.840- 05:10.120* :  on the 13th and his family didn't even know he was here. They are still unclear on his motive,
*05:10.120- 05:15.660* :  but they do not believe that he was targeting any particular individual or group or indeed this trial.
*05:15.660- 05:21.820* :  And they base that on what they say were conspiracy theory-like posts on social media before
*05:21.820- 05:26.840* :  this incident and the nature of those pamphlets that he threw in the air. But nevertheless,
*05:26.940- 05:32.300* :  they say that they are going to be reviewing security protocols. This is a park that is open to
*05:32.300- 05:36.180* :  the public. They are going to decide if they need to shut the park down or if additional
*05:36.180- 05:41.960* :  resources have to be pulled in. Donald Trump, everyone involved in the trial, has been made
*05:41.960- 05:46.160* :  aware of this incident, but the court has resumed and it is on schedule.
*05:46.880- 05:53.140* :  Nader Talfiq. Part of the Middle East seemed calm in the hours after an apparent Israeli attack
*05:53.140- 05:57.760* :  on Iran raised the specter's spiraling violence between the two implacable enemies.
*05:58.480- 06:02.780* :  If it was the Israelis, as almost everyone seems to assume, they calibrated their actions
*06:02.780- 06:08.160* :  carefully. Striking an area where Iran has a nuclear facility, as well as an airbase and other
*06:08.680- 06:13.240* :  significant military sites. The Iranians were quick to talk down the impact and significance of
*06:13.240- 06:17.780* :  the attack, but in Tehran on Friday, feelings were still running high, with crowds chanting
*06:17.780- 06:27.780* :  anti-Israeli slogans. The muted response from Iran has raised hopes that regional tensions
*06:27.780- 06:32.860* :  can be kept in check. The UN Secretary-General and the U.S. Secretary of State led to the
*06:32.860- 06:38.080* :  international calls for calm. Followed later by the White House Press Secretary Kerry in Jean-Pierre.
*06:38.460- 06:43.760* :  We have been very, very clear from the beginning that we do not want to see this conflict escalate.
*06:43.760- 06:47.640* :  We continue to consult with our allies and partners, including in the region,
*06:47.640- 06:50.480* :  obviously, and to reduce further risk of escalation.
*06:50.860- 06:55.740* :  BBC's We're a Davis is in Jerusalem. I asked him if Friday's strike looked like a one-off
*06:56.060- 07:00.240* :  or the start of something bigger. I think it has drawn a line for now
*07:00.240- 07:05.980* :  under this particular route between Israel and Iran. Most Israelis had expected their government
*07:05.980- 07:09.380* :  to respond, but there was some surprise that it happened right now because we're about to
*07:09.380- 07:14.920* :  enter the Jewish holy week of Passover, and most Israelis assume this would have happened
*07:14.920- 07:20.500* :  after Passover. But again, it falls into the narrative of Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would
*07:20.500- 07:26.560* :  respond. He rejected those calls from the U.S. and the UK last Sunday in the immediate aftermath
*07:26.560- 07:31.460* :  of the Iranian attack. So Israel felt it had to do something. This was its response for now.
*07:31.460- 07:36.080* :  It's very, very limited, but Iran has got major allies in the region, particularly
*07:36.080- 07:41.200* :  Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Iran could quite easily continue its conflict against Israel
*07:41.200- 07:46.760* :  through Hezbollah. We are in Jerusalem. What's the reaction being there to this seeming?
*07:47.020- 07:51.980* :  Israeli attack on Iran. Israeli public opinion is divided. They want to live in a peaceful
*07:51.980- 07:56.460* :  society in a peaceful region, but we keep on having these wars, and a lot of Israelis want
*07:56.460- 08:01.900* :  to see an end to that. But equally, they see the impact of aggression against Israel. You know,
*08:02.140- 08:06.780* :  Israel is a small country, and they say it is already shrunk. If you think of those communities
*08:06.780- 08:10.760* :  now, there's kid butses around certain guards that people are not living for the time being,
*08:11.080- 08:14.780* :  then in the northern border there are 80,000 people who've been evacuated from the northern
*08:14.780- 08:19.120* :  border because of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. And now with what is happening
*08:19.120- 08:25.580* :  with Iran, Israelis will begin to feel threatened again from the east. So there are Israelis who support
*08:25.580- 08:30.120* :  their government's belligerent approach. There are also other Israelis who see the peril in that,
*08:30.120- 08:36.440* :  and what some sort of negotiated solution. We're a Davis there in Jerusalem. So will Israel and Iran
*08:36.440- 08:41.800* :  now heed to the numerous pleas for a de-escalation and try to keep the peace? Our chief international
*08:41.800- 08:46.320* :  correspondent, Lee Stusset, gave me her assessment after a week of heightened tension.
*08:46.820- 08:53.940* :  Both sides will want to project the notion that they have reestablished deterrence, but equally
*08:53.940- 08:58.660* :  that they are in pole position for the next round, because there will be a next round.
*08:58.660- 09:04.420* :  It had been widely predicted that Israel would strike after the Passover holiday. The fact that
*09:04.420- 09:10.200* :  it decided to strike before indicates it believed it was absolutely critical to send a very strong
*09:10.200- 09:17.120* :  signal to Iran that Israel would and could strike wherever and however it wanted to.
*09:17.300- 09:21.860* :  The fact that it didn't even acknowledge it officially means that Iran has been able to
*09:21.860- 09:27.760* :  exploit this gray space and say, well, it was so weak. We don't even know who did it. Both
*09:27.760- 09:32.300* :  sides are for the moment claiming victory, but both sides know it isn't over.
*09:32.560- 09:38.800* :  An interesting take, maybe from the Iranians, then seeming to be talking down the likelihood of
*09:39.380- 09:46.720* :  taking any further action against Israel. Is that reassuring or could there be another sting
*09:46.720- 09:51.620* :  in the tale you say this isn't over? Bear in mind that in the days leading up to what happened
*09:51.620- 09:57.140* :  in the early hours, a very limited strike for days Iran was saying, if you hit us in the
*09:57.140- 10:02.520* :  tiniest of ways, you will face an immediate and harsh response. The fact that it's trying to
*10:02.520- 10:06.500* :  project the idea there was no invasion, it may not even have been Israel, we just don't know,
*10:06.600- 10:11.840* :  there was no damage, means that they save face, they don't have to reply, but they make it very
*10:11.840- 10:18.200* :  clear that their so-called strategic patience doctrine is over, and if Israel, before or after
*10:18.200- 10:23.840* :  the Passover holiday, strikes again, Iran will strike back. Our chief international correspondent
*10:23.840- 10:29.860* :  Least you said. Now, can you imagine ICE as a luxury item? Well, in the West African
*10:29.860- 10:36.860* :  country of Marley, ICE has become just that. The cost has tripled in some parts of the capital,
*10:36.860- 10:42.720* :  Bamako, due to a searing heat wave and severe electricity crisis. The increase in temperatures,
*10:42.720- 10:48.460* :  reaching highs of 48 degrees Celsius has resulted in more than 100 deaths. Priusipi has been speaking
*10:48.460- 10:55.540* :  to people across Bamako to find out how they're coping. In a quiet commune in Bamako, Marley's
*10:55.540- 11:01.780* :  capital, 15-year-old Fatima Yatara, is on her way to buy ICE from the local vendor.
*11:05.980- 11:12.080* :  I've come to buy ICE here because it's very hot now. People need to drink fresh water at least.
*11:12.900- 11:18.640* :  In some places, it's 100 francs, 300, 500 you know, it's too expensive.
*11:21.160- 11:27.600* :  People in Bamako are suffering from a heat wave that's reached 48 degrees, but for many,
*11:27.600- 11:35.480* :  using ICE to cool down is no longer an option. As Sistantrao lives in Maganburg in Bamako,
*11:35.920- 11:42.040* :  she says the cost of ICE has tripled in some places. It now costs more than bread and milk.
*11:44.100- 11:52.220* :  Sellers bring us ICE from the military camp and sell it to us at 300 franc a unit. We hardly ever
*11:52.220- 11:57.780* :  have electricity in Maganambuku, so in the end we have no choice.
*11:58.800- 12:05.380* :  Severe power cuts have left people unable to use their fridges, making ICE more scarce and
*12:05.380- 12:10.960* :  driving up prices. The constant power cuts are also making it difficult to store food.
*12:12.980- 12:17.860* :  To find relief from the scorching temperatures, some try to splash their body with water.
*12:18.220- 12:25.900* :  As is the case for Sumali Maiga who lives in Bamako, he takes a small metal kettle and pours water
*12:25.900- 12:35.220* :  over his head. It's unbearable for me given my health because I suffer from dizziness.
*12:35.220- 12:45.300* :  I pour water on myself all day long to survive, and we suffer. We really suffer more than 100
*12:45.300- 12:52.080* :  people have died from heat-related causes since the heat wave began in March. Professor Yakuba
*12:52.080- 13:00.220* :  Toloba works at the University Hospital in Bamako. We were seeing around 20 deaths and around
*13:00.240- 13:07.140* :  15 hospitalizations per day, around the country, it would exceed hundreds. Most of these patients
*13:07.640- 13:12.640* :  came in with the dehydration. The main symptoms were a cough and bronchio congestion.
*13:15.740- 13:19.920* :  Many countries in West Africa have been experiencing record-breaking heat waves,
*13:19.920- 13:26.620* :  which scientists are attributing to climate change. Back in Bamako, local vendors continue to
*13:26.620- 13:32.320* :  stock their fridges with water, as temperatures look to remain over 40 degrees for the next few weeks.
*13:32.840- 13:35.620* :  For Maliens, this is their new normal for now.
*13:37.040- 13:42.100* :  Priya Sipi without report. Mark Zuckerberg, the 39-year-old founder and CEO of Meta
*13:42.100- 13:47.280* :  Platforms, is making headlines on multiple social media platforms, posing in a Photoshopped
*13:47.280- 13:52.400* :  image with a bearded look that has gone viral. Also causing a buzz is Aiden Ross,
*13:52.480- 13:57.560* :  the famous streamer with millions of followers, is the latest celebrity to have his likeness
*13:57.560- 14:05.020* :  faked using artificial intelligence by online scammers. Viral clips show an AI imposter pretending
*14:05.020- 14:10.740* :  to be the star, encouraging unwitting fans to smash high-priced electronics for money.
*14:11.260- 14:14.380* :  BBC reporter Laura Cress told James Reynolds more.
*14:14.700- 14:19.880* :  So I've seen these videos, they're up on TikTok. It does look like him and I think what they've
*14:19.880- 14:25.840* :  used stream footage from him and they've also used AI voice modulation. I have to say some of
*14:25.840- 14:29.920* :  the clips don't really sound that much like him. He's got quite a high pitch for voice
*14:29.920- 14:36.100* :  and he gets very excitable. I think that's quite hard for AI to modulate and this is using this
*14:36.520- 14:42.780* :  video chat app called Monkey, where you talk to random people on random videos. The fans that he's
*14:42.780- 14:48.220* :  talking to are quite young and quite impressionable, so a lot of the time even they are questioning
*14:48.220- 14:53.140* :  at the beginning when they're talking to this AI persona. They're saying, is that you? They're not
*14:53.140- 14:57.620* :  sure, but the more they talk to him, the more because he's quite known for doing these sort of
*14:57.620- 15:03.580* :  prank videos. So this is the kind of thing he could potentially do. And have people been taken in?
*15:03.780- 15:09.020* :  Yes, so that's where these clips are gone viral because this AI persona, he's saying things like
*15:09.020- 15:13.900* :  go on, smash your TV, smash your PlayStation, smash all these devices you've got and I'll
*15:14.060- 15:18.440* :  pay more than what it's worth, but he does do that kind of thing. He gets people to do stunts
*15:18.440- 15:23.900* :  for money on some of his services. And has he responded at all and how can he respond me when he says,
*15:23.900- 15:28.420* :  look, this is really me and I'll prove it. There is a reaction video of him reacting to this,
*15:28.420- 15:33.380* :  but I thought, wait a second, this could just be another AI reacting to that video.
*15:33.380- 15:39.180* :  That's gets very tough to make your head hurt, but I think it actually is him. And what's interesting
*15:39.180- 15:45.300* :  is he says it doesn't sound like me. He actually does say that's not funny, but then he does say,
*15:45.300- 15:50.880* :  at the end, he says, don't break your stuff unless it's actually me. It's telling that he's maybe,
*15:50.880- 15:55.000* :  he doesn't mind the prank, but he maybe doesn't like that it's someone taking his likeness.
*15:55.160- 15:58.840* :  And Laura, while we got you, our day began on the group chat with a picture of Mark Zuckerberg
*15:58.840- 16:03.560* :  with a beard. Yes. Why were we talking about that? Yes, a lot of people were marking this picture.
*16:03.560- 16:08.480* :  So yeah, the head of meta, he had this launch of this new version, fully enough of meta AI,
*16:08.480- 16:14.220* :  and after sharing this video, someone photoshopped a screen grab of Mark Zuckerberg with a beard.
*16:14.680- 16:19.180* :  It's a fake picture, completely photoshopped again, but quite a few people were taken in by it,
*16:19.400- 16:23.640* :  and a lot of people actually thought maybe he should grow a beard after seeing the image.
*16:24.280- 16:31.160* :  Laura Chris, there, speaking to James Reynolds. The reach of Indian culture is global, and this
*16:31.160- 16:36.740* :  summer, one of the world's biggest live music events, Glastonbury here in England, will have its
*16:36.740- 16:42.220* :  first ever dedicated South Asian area. Festival Goers will find it in the Shangri-La section,
*16:42.640- 16:47.040* :  which celebrates underrepresented art and culture. The announcement comes in the same week that
*16:47.040- 16:53.040* :  saw the launch of the first ever official British Asian music chart to help more young talent
*16:53.080- 16:58.660* :  into the big time. Bobby Friction is a DJ and presenter on the BBC's Asian network, and he's been
*16:58.660- 17:02.760* :  going to Glastonbury for more than 30 years. He told me what he thought of the changes.
*17:03.340- 17:10.440* :  I'm feeling on top of the world, actually, because I'm someone who loves Glastonbury. I've
*17:10.440- 17:17.140* :  limbed it over the years as a hunter and a performer, and this was a dream of mine, and I thought it
*17:17.140- 17:22.640* :  might take 10 years, but it's actually taken about 10 months. Why so significant?
*17:23.240- 17:28.820* :  A, there's stuff happening in Britain culturally, where essentially the British Asian communities
*17:28.820- 17:34.860* :  now 10% of the population, and Britain was still very traditional with our entertainment,
*17:34.860- 17:41.980* :  and music is still very much, we make music, or we look towards our Black brothers and sisters,
*17:42.460- 17:48.180* :  but the idea of a multiplicity of different musical sources isn't something we're really good
*17:48.180- 17:54.600* :  with in Britain. Globally, Latin music is one of the biggest music forms, so is Korean
*17:54.600- 17:59.860* :  music in K-pop and Afro beats. You know, some of the most dreamed artists in the world are South
*17:59.860- 18:07.140* :  Asian, so it's all of that timing globally, and also the timing demographically here in Britain,
*18:07.740- 18:10.360* :  which means that this year had to be the year it's going to happen.
*18:10.740- 18:15.560* :  What can festival go as I expect to see them? It is definitely a South Asian musical space.
*18:15.560- 18:20.580* :  There'll be, of course, stuff like dry and bass, the house music and electronic music and
*18:21.040- 18:27.320* :  hip hop and jazz, but a lot of it will have a South Asian influence, and actually the stage design
*18:27.320- 18:33.040* :  is based on a kind of concept of South Asian futurism. It's going to be like a
*18:33.040- 18:37.120* :  Bollywood movie, but a science fiction one in the 25th century.
*18:37.480- 18:39.260* :  And what do you think the audiences will make of this?
*18:39.520- 18:44.800* :  Well, I think the audiences of Glastonbury are possibly some of the most open minds here in Britain,
*18:45.280- 18:48.820* :  so I think they're going to really like it, and people who vote at Glastonbury to see
*18:48.820- 18:55.340* :  your established artists like Dewey Leighborough, Paul Play still want that swirl of the new,
*18:55.340- 18:59.960* :  that will radical creativity. We're going to give them that, and we're giving it to them
*18:59.960- 19:05.960* :  in Shangri-La, which traditionally has been the more radical side of Glastonbury anyway.
*19:07.240- 19:09.600* :  DJ and presenter Bobby Friction.
*19:12.100- 19:16.360* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast, the cutting-edge technology being created to
*19:16.360- 19:19.080* :  make gaming easier for disabled people.
*19:19.540- 19:24.120* :  I'm just moving around here in Minecraft by using my right arm as a mouse and my left arm
*19:24.320- 19:26.260* :  like a joystick. I was so calm.
*19:26.560- 19:29.260* :  I was also able to play Minecraft using eye-tracking.
*19:29.520- 19:29.800* :  The cow!
*19:38.460- 19:44.520* :  China's president Xi Jinping has appeared at a ceremony in Beijing to unveil a new cyberforce.
*19:51.420- 19:55.260* :  The game says Beijing is to bolster China's capacity to fight and win wars.
*19:55.860- 19:59.140* :  The move comes weeks after Western countries, including the US and Britain,
*19:59.140- 20:01.740* :  accused the communist state of cyber espionage.
*20:01.900- 20:08.440* :  So then, what is the purpose of this new force? A question for our Asia-Pacific Regional Editor,
*20:08.800- 20:09.480* :  Celia Hatton.
*20:09.900- 20:15.360* :  There was a ceremony held in Beijing today, Xi Jinping, who crucially is also the head of China's
*20:15.360- 20:20.540* :  Central Military Commission. He was at this special ceremony to present a flag,
*20:20.540- 20:26.440* :  designating the beginning of this information support force, which is a new branch of the
*20:26.440- 20:31.900* :  military. He gave a speech saying that this was a major strategic decision of far-reaching
*20:31.900- 20:35.800* :  significance, so basically signaling that this branch is of incredible importance.
*20:35.800- 20:39.220* :  He said crucially that it's important in winning modern wars.
*20:39.240- 20:43.460* :  We know that the information support force is directly situated
*20:43.460- 20:47.700* :  under the Central Military Commission, so it's quite important in terms of ranking.
*20:47.700- 20:55.580* :  What we don't know is how this new information support force fits in line with the old branch
*20:55.640- 20:59.740* :  of the military that used to deal with this kind of stuff. It was known as the strategic
*20:59.740- 21:05.760* :  support force, and it was established way back in 2015, and it was supposed to offer intelligence
*21:05.760- 21:12.800* :  for all of the military, expand the military's capabilities and cyberspace and psychological warfare,
*21:12.800- 21:17.820* :  but clearly Xi Jinping thought it was important enough that he should emphasize that this was
*21:17.820- 21:23.400* :  a major decision. What does his tell us about China's defence strategy? Is it moving more toward
*21:23.400- 21:27.400* :  cyber warfare? I mean, when Xi Jinping first came into power more than 10 years ago,
*21:27.560- 21:32.960* :  one of the first things he said was to announce that China's people's liberation army,
*21:32.960- 21:38.680* :  which at the time had the world's largest standing army was outdated. He said it needed to be
*21:38.680- 21:43.700* :  overhauled, and that's really what he's done, and he's really made it a modern army.
*21:43.980- 21:48.580* :  And tell us about the timing here. Just weeks ago, we might recall the US was joined by other
*21:48.580- 21:54.120* :  countries, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, insane their government's journalists and corporations have
*21:54.120- 22:01.340* :  been targeted by Chinese cyber espionage. Just yesterday, the US National Security Agency warned
*22:01.340- 22:06.400* :  again that they believe that China is trying to access critical infrastructure so that it can
*22:06.400- 22:13.380* :  threaten that infrastructure in a conflict. So we've been having the United States and US allies
*22:13.380- 22:20.920* :  repeatedly accusing Beijing of carrying out espionage operations. So three weeks ago, they actually
*22:20.920- 22:26.940* :  named the group that they believe is doing this in China. The APT-31, the advanced persistence
*22:26.940- 22:32.920* :  threat group, is a group believed to be of state-backed Chinese hackers who are targeting
*22:32.920- 22:39.280* :  governments, journalists, corporations around the world, not just in the United States, which is
*22:39.280- 22:45.600* :  an obvious target, but in countries like Finland, Finland says that APT-31 attacked its parliament
*22:45.600- 22:53.120* :  not too long ago. Celia Hatton there. Belgian ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo says
*22:53.120- 22:58.320* :  the country should file a complaint with the International Court of Justice over Rwanda's failure
*22:58.320- 23:04.680* :  to respect its border, speaking at a meeting to assess the deepening crisis in eastern Congo.
*23:04.680- 23:08.800* :  Roxanne de Bildeling said more should be done to hold Rwanda to account.
*23:09.360- 23:12.780* :  Congolese forces have been struggling to push back M23 rebels.
*23:13.280- 23:16.000* :  Our Africa Regional Editor Richard Hamilton has this.
*23:16.600- 23:22.200* :  The UN says fighting in eastern Congo has displaced more than 700,000 people
*23:22.200- 23:27.560* :  in the first three months of the year. The conflict can be traced back to the Rwanda
*23:27.560- 23:34.720* :  genocide in 1994. Several western countries, including the former colonial power Belgium,
*23:34.720- 23:42.860* :  accuse Rwanda of backing the M23, which Kigali denies. It in turn blames Kinshasa for
*23:42.860- 23:51.280* :  arming a Hutu rebel group, the FDLR. The M23 are Tutsi led, and many analysts say Rwanda
*23:51.280- 23:56.680* :  is using them to protect itself from Hutus who were perpetrators of the genocide,
*23:56.700- 24:01.020* :  but who fled across the border afterwards. Richard Hamilton.
*24:02.340- 24:07.840* :  The US has received sanctions against Venezuela's crucial oil industry for failing to meet a
*24:07.840- 24:13.420* :  deadline this week to ease its suppression of dissent. Last October, the Biden administration
*24:13.560- 24:19.300* :  signed an agreement to relax restrictions in exchange for President Maduro opening up the
*24:19.300- 24:24.320* :  electoral process. However, suppression has continued with the main political opponents being
*24:24.320- 24:30.120* :  barred from standing in July's elections. Caracas has insisted its oil sector will keep going
*24:30.120- 24:36.180* :  regardless of US policy. Rob Young asked Venezuelan journalist Victor Hamaya in Caracas
*24:36.680- 24:39.840* :  whether Washington's decision to renew the sanctions was a surprise.
*24:40.620- 24:46.260* :  It was no secret that the sanctions would be reimposed. People are also noting that the
*24:46.260- 24:51.060* :  license that it's keeping Chevron operating inside the country, it hasn't been touched,
*24:51.160- 24:56.380* :  and that's the very important one because the oil in Venezuela is being pumped mainly by
*24:56.380- 25:01.460* :  Chevron. So the big American oil giant Chevron will be allowed to carry on working in the country then.
*25:01.780- 25:08.820* :  What is the potential economic impact of these sanctions? The main income source of the Venezuelan
*25:08.820- 25:15.140* :  government and the Venezuelan state is the oil business. It's our only product of exportation
*25:15.660- 25:21.740* :  of this point. The Venezuelan economy has had a terrible decade or so. What is daily life like
*25:21.740- 25:28.980* :  for most people at the moment? 2024 has been complicated. We all feel that the economy has lost
*25:28.980- 25:36.900* :  the impulse that we saw in 2023. There is a lot of poverty still and there is no much access
*25:37.420- 25:43.780* :  to buying some food, buying groceries and buying basic things for living in Venezuela. There is
*25:43.780- 25:52.640* :  no problems about the availability of goods, but the problem is how can you pay? And also the
*25:52.640- 25:59.600* :  public services like water, electricity, cooking gas in houses, those are supposedly a guarantee
*25:59.600- 26:05.440* :  by the government, but the system is broken. So a lot of people, even in rural communities and
*26:05.440- 26:11.460* :  in poor communities, has to pay private company to get access to clean water, to keep businesses open
*26:11.460- 26:19.360* :  and to keep some sectors fully operating. It also expands that is really heavy in the people's
*26:19.360- 26:26.360* :  budget month to month. Now the US is reimposing these sanctions because President Nicolas Maduro
*26:26.840- 26:32.820* :  broke various promises to do with the upcoming election. The candidate chosen by the opposition
*26:32.820- 26:37.600* :  who he had hung the program a few weeks ago was banned from running. So what's the government
*26:37.600- 26:44.800* :  expecting the sanctions to be imposed? Yes, but also the president of the state oil company
*26:44.800- 26:51.480* :  said yesterday that they were not only prepared because they were also looking at the new license
*26:51.480- 26:59.400* :  that the US government issued the license 44A that permits the companies that were making businesses
*26:59.400- 27:03.960* :  with the PDVSA to keep doing businesses. That's the state oil company.
*27:04.220- 27:12.040* :  Yeah, up until May 31 to finish those businesses, but also permitting the specific companies to ask
*27:12.200- 27:19.120* :  Treasury Department permissions to continue operating in Venezuela. Every scenario presented by the
*27:19.680- 27:26.200* :  opinion polls and the academia tells that there is no scenario in which with a free and fair elections,
*27:26.200- 27:32.640* :  Maduro will not be the losing candidate. So I think the threat of sanctions is never more
*27:32.640- 27:38.880* :  dangerous than the threat of losing power. Venezuelan journalist Victor Hamea speaking to Rob Young.
*27:39.980- 27:44.800* :  Now for many people using a mouse or a keyboard to play video games or operate their computer
*27:44.800- 27:50.180* :  is second nature. But for some disabled people, this can be much more of a challenge. The BBC's
*27:50.180- 27:54.920* :  Paul Carter has been finding out about new software using movement as a controller.
*27:57.440- 28:02.620* :  I'm at the Richard Cloudsley School in London, although this is no ordinary lesson.
*28:03.540- 28:07.060* :  Not only are these pupils getting to play video games during school time,
*28:07.740- 28:12.640* :  they're also helping to test some exciting new software known as Motion Input.
*28:15.000- 28:19.940* :  Motion Input allows anyone to control their computers using any part of their body they
*28:19.940- 28:26.980* :  can move. This could be by moving the eyes, individual limbs or body parts, or even by gestures,
*28:27.340- 28:32.920* :  facial movements or speech, giving a raft of potential new input methods to disabled people.
*28:34.220- 28:39.260* :  The collection of programs have been developed over four years by more than 200 students
*28:39.260- 28:45.460* :  at University College London. Crucially, Motion Input doesn't need any additional specialized
*28:45.460- 28:51.760* :  equipment. It works using a normal computer and webcam. It's focused on AI for your PC,
*28:51.760- 28:56.780* :  so it runs completely on your own laptops and PCs. Dean Muhammad Ali is professor of computer
*28:56.780- 29:02.360* :  science at UCL. Our work with the Motion Input software was developed in partnership with Intel.
*29:02.420- 29:08.320* :  It has its own engine in the tunnel to do the evaluation of how people can be seen to be moving
*29:08.320- 29:13.820* :  and it uses just a webcam. Previous technologies that have been released have enabled children to
*29:13.820- 29:19.400* :  play games with movements. This technology democratises that, it makes it equitable computing,
*29:19.400- 29:23.600* :  and from the perspective of a user choosing their own games, setting the movements that they
*29:23.600- 29:27.360* :  want to set and being able to play the way that they want to play it, that's where we think
*29:27.360- 29:33.400* :  the real foundational challenges. The UCL students have been working with the pupils to help
*29:33.400- 29:40.140* :  identify potential bugs or development issues with the software. Safia is using her iMovements
*29:40.140- 29:45.120* :  to play different games that would ordinarily use a mouse or controller. You're a better driver
*29:45.120- 29:50.780* :  than I am. Afterwards, I asked her what she thought, using her communication device. It is good.
*29:50.780- 29:57.320* :  It helps me to focus. And is it easy to use? Yes, it is easy. It helps me experience every
*29:57.320- 30:01.660* :  action of the game. And is it better than playing other ways you might have done before?
*30:02.620- 30:07.300* :  Yes, I've only tried the Nintendo Wii. This new controller helps me play better.
*30:07.620- 30:14.360* :  Over at UCL, the students working on different elements of motion input were keen for someone
*30:14.360- 30:20.380* :  slightly less youthful to have a go and see how it works. First up, everyone's favourite
*30:20.380- 30:26.260* :  block builder and basher, Minecraft. So I'm just moving around here and Minecraft by using my
*30:26.260- 30:32.160* :  right arm as a mouse and my left arm. It's kind of like a joystick. I was also able to play
*30:32.160- 30:42.160* :  Minecraft using eye tracking. As well as Minecraft, I was able to take Rocket League for a spin,
*30:42.780- 30:48.380* :  a game where you play football with cars, and try other games using different inputs such as
*30:48.380- 30:53.660* :  head movements. A team is also developing software that will run using a phone camera.
*30:55.280- 31:00.020* :  Although the initial focus has been on gaming, the future aim is to commercialise the
*31:00.020- 31:05.340* :  non-accessibility applications of the software into industries and spaces where touchless computing
*31:05.860- 31:08.780* :  could be a benefit, such as manufacturing or healthcare.
*31:10.600- 31:15.680* :  Paul Carter with that report. Now, when it comes to American football, winning teams get trophies,
*31:15.680- 31:21.320* :  and the winning players get jewelry. And to that effect, a superbowl ring is one of the most
*31:21.320- 31:30.260* :  coveted and expensive prizes in sports. Just imagine losing yours in a giant tank of chili.
*31:30.260- 31:37.000* :  Yes, chili. Ella Bicknell takes up the story. I legitimately lost my superbowl ring in this event.
*31:37.000- 31:42.640* :  We have yet to find it. All of this stuff has been thrown away, so I think we can safely assume
*31:42.640- 31:46.560* :  that my superbowl ring is now in a landfill, someplace in the Cincinnati Tri-State area.
*31:46.840- 31:52.320* :  That's retired NFL star Jason Kelsey, revealing he lost his superbowl ring in one of the strangest
*31:52.320- 31:57.680* :  ways you could possibly imagine. The superbowl ring is officially gone. We've already put the
*31:57.680- 32:02.960* :  insurance claim in, which I think the insurance company might have something to say about whether
*32:02.960- 32:07.380* :  they're going to have 100%. They're going to have, especially if you're going to tell the entire
*32:07.380- 32:13.720* :  world how you lost it. Underdogs no more. The Philadelphia Eagles are these superbowl champions.
*32:13.980- 32:18.560* :  He's one of the most celebrated American football players of all time. In his 13 years playing
*32:18.560- 32:23.600* :  all-pro football, he helped his team the Philadelphia Eagles make it to two superbowl finals,
*32:23.600- 32:32.780* :  winning in 2018. Welcome back to New Heights. He co-hosts New Heights, one of the most successful
*32:32.780- 32:37.900* :  sports podcasts, alongside his brother Travis, three time superbowl winner himself and boyfriend
*32:37.900- 32:42.600* :  of Taylor Swift. It was last week during a live show in their home city of Cincinnati,
*32:42.600- 32:47.980* :  Jason lost his ring. The brothers hosted one game which had contestants waiting into
*32:47.980- 32:54.060* :  Paul's film with Chili Spaghetti and Cheese to find Jason's ring amidst several decoys, except
*32:54.060- 32:59.940* :  it was never found. But there's actually metal in Skyline Chili. There's traces of iron within
