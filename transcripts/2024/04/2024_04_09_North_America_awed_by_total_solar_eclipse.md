*01:25.540- 01:27.940* :  I'm Rachel Wright, and in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:27.940- 01:30.440* :  the 9th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:30.440- 01:34.800* :  A total eclipse of the sun has been experienced across North America,
*01:34.800- 01:38.080* :  bringing temporary darkness to tens of millions of people.

*01:50.900- 01:54.660* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:55.320- 01:56.880* :  I have fatigue so bad,
*01:57.380- 01:59.400* :  even just changing a pillowcase on a bed,
*01:59.900- 02:01.140* :  it's breathless,
*02:01.760- 02:02.720* :  can't walk far,
*02:03.280- 02:05.020* :  even to a local shop, which isn't far,
*02:05.400- 02:06.060* :  I can't walk.
*02:06.700- 02:09.020* :  Researchers have found that people with long COVID
*02:09.020- 02:11.200* :  had signs of inflammation in their blood,
*02:11.600- 02:13.900* :  which could help the search for suitable treatment.
*02:19.520- 02:23.020* :  Tens of millions of people in Mexico, Canada and the United States
*02:23.040- 02:24.760* :  have witnessed something spectacular,
*02:24.760- 02:27.500* :  a total eclipse of the sun by the moon.
*02:27.980- 02:30.900* :  That's when the new moon moves between the sun and the earth,
*02:30.900- 02:34.980* :  blocking out the sun's rays and casting a shadow on parts of the earth.
*02:35.500- 02:39.400* :  It started in the city of Masatlan on the west coast of Mexico,
*02:40.000- 02:41.800* :  as the moon loomed over the sea,
*02:41.980- 02:43.400* :  hundreds gathered at the beach,
*02:43.400- 02:45.040* :  including the Mexican president,
*02:45.040- 02:46.900* :  to see the darkness at noon.
*02:47.420- 02:51.140* :  Oh my gosh, you can look at it right now without the glass dark.
*02:51.460- 02:52.660* :  There's the diamond ring!
*02:54.200- 02:56.080* :  It looks like right after sunset,
*02:56.440- 02:59.800* :  you know, that darkness and the sun's covered, it's beautiful.
*03:00.400- 03:02.620* :  There's a sunset sunrise in every single direction.
*03:03.120- 03:04.220* :  People are losing their minds.
*03:05.060- 03:07.700* :  It is very exciting. I can see stars and planets.
*03:08.360- 03:11.440* :  It feels like there's a really bizarre twilight sunset.
*03:12.200- 03:12.900* :  In every direction.
*03:17.120- 03:18.640* :  Just over half an hour later,
*03:18.940- 03:20.420* :  it reached the United States.
*03:20.420- 03:22.160* :  Our correspondent, Nomiya Igbal,
*03:22.160- 03:24.320* :  was in the city of Mesquite, in Texas.
*03:27.900- 03:29.080* :  It's happened.
*03:29.100- 03:31.300* :  I'm going to take my sunglasses off.
*03:31.820- 03:32.080* :  Wow!
*03:33.900- 03:35.180* :  Oh my gosh.
*03:37.880- 03:39.240* :  People have got their phones out,
*03:39.960- 03:41.140* :  and it's just amazing.
*03:43.180- 03:45.820* :  You can see it's like a halo around the sun,
*03:46.280- 03:47.300* :  and the moon never lines,
*03:47.320- 03:49.320* :  and it's now moving through the clouds.
*03:51.300- 03:52.420* :  And we're in total darkness.
*03:54.900- 03:57.580* :  Children just standing up in complete awe.
*03:59.160- 04:01.380* :  It's thrilling. It's a really thrilling moment.
*04:02.160- 04:04.180* :  Next in Arkansas, a mass wedding
*04:04.180- 04:06.420* :  marks the moment in the words of the song,
*04:06.680- 04:08.200* :  a total eclipse of the heart.
*04:08.800- 04:10.620* :  And then finally, 30 minutes later,
*04:10.620- 04:13.480* :  Nida Taufik watched on at Niagara Falls,
*04:13.840- 04:16.560* :  as the state of New York was plunged into darkness.
*04:17.100- 04:18.080* :  You can hear the cheers.
*04:19.300- 04:20.240* :  You know, there it is.
*04:20.240- 04:21.700* :  It's peeking through the clouds.
*04:21.700- 04:23.740* :  Mother Nature is teasing us.
*04:23.800- 04:24.700* :  There it is.
*04:25.400- 04:26.920* :  Wow, that is spectacular.
*04:28.100- 04:30.000* :  Oh wow, that is fabulous.
*04:30.520- 04:31.080* :  Here we go.
*04:31.080- 04:32.220* :  It is fully on.
*04:32.220- 04:33.680* :  You can see it fully now.
*04:35.060- 04:35.860* :  You can see it out.
*04:36.180- 04:38.240* :  Mother Nature is truly teasing us today.
*04:38.240- 04:39.780* :  Earlier during the Marshall Eclipse,
*04:39.780- 04:40.640* :  it peeked through.
*04:41.180- 04:42.280* :  It's peeked through again.
*04:43.240- 04:44.000* :  So there you go.
*04:44.000- 04:45.960* :  All of the people who have gathered here,
*04:45.960- 04:48.200* :  they weren't short-changed at all,
*04:48.720- 04:49.880* :  getting to experience
*04:50.780- 04:51.900* :  totality here,
*04:52.180- 04:54.140* :  and that absolutely bright corona.
*04:55.280- 04:57.440* :  For thousands of years, total solar
*04:57.440- 05:00.880* :  eclipses have fascinated and also frightened people here
*05:00.880- 05:01.820* :  on planet Earth.
*05:02.300- 05:04.240* :  They are major astronomical events.
*05:04.860- 05:05.880* :  Our science correspondent,
*05:05.880- 05:07.580* :  Palab ghost, has more details.
*05:08.280- 05:11.520* :  A total eclipse is one of the universe's great natural
*05:11.520- 05:14.540* :  spectacles because of an almost uncanny,
*05:14.740- 05:15.840* :  cosmic coincidence.
*05:16.840- 05:18.700* :  At the moment just before totality,
*05:19.120- 05:22.400* :  the last chink of light seems to increase in brightness,
*05:23.100- 05:25.380* :  forming what's called the diamond ring effect.
*05:26.080- 05:28.720* :  But that's just the lead-in to the real showstopper.
*05:29.360- 05:32.600* :  That's the sight of the solar atmosphere around the moon.
*05:33.300- 05:34.400* :  It's normally not visible
*05:34.920- 05:37.260* :  because the brightness of the sun washes it out.
*05:37.800- 05:40.400* :  But because the moon is exactly the right size
*05:40.400- 05:42.820* :  and exactly the right distance from the Earth,
*05:43.180- 05:45.800* :  it blocks off the dazzling part of the sun
*05:46.180- 05:48.000* :  to reveal a vision of the moon
*05:48.000- 05:51.220* :  as a gigantic shimmering black pearl
*05:51.600- 05:53.280* :  hanging in the darkened sky.
*05:54.420- 05:57.360* :  If the moon were ever so slightly larger or closer,
*05:57.900- 06:00.240* :  then it would block out this incredible spectacle.
*06:01.020- 06:03.100* :  If it were a little smaller or further away,
*06:03.100- 06:07.200* :  the tiny amount of light from the sun's bright disc would wash it away.
*06:07.560- 06:09.440* :  Our science correspondent, Palab ghost,
*06:10.540- 06:13.520* :  abortion rights are likely to be an important issue
*06:13.520- 06:16.180* :  in the American presidential election in November.
*06:16.700- 06:19.220* :  Now Donald Trump, who secured the candidacy
*06:19.220- 06:21.120* :  for the Republican Party last month,
*06:21.120- 06:22.980* :  has offered his opinion on the matter.
*06:23.480- 06:25.660* :  Mr. Trump was speaking in a video statement
*06:25.660- 06:28.600* :  released on his social media site, Truth Social.
*06:28.980- 06:30.660* :  My view is now that we have abortion
*06:30.660- 06:33.460* :  where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint,
*06:34.240- 06:37.960* :  the states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both.
*06:38.660- 06:41.980* :  And whatever they decide must be the law of the land.
*06:42.020- 06:44.700* :  In this case, the law of the state.
*06:45.440- 06:46.940* :  Many states will be different.
*06:47.260- 06:49.700* :  Many will have a different number of weeks
*06:49.700- 06:53.200* :  or some will have more conservative than others.
*06:53.400- 06:54.540* :  And that's what they will be.
*06:54.540- 06:58.020* :  At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people.
*06:58.540- 07:01.160* :  I asked our Washington correspondent Tom Bateman
*07:01.160- 07:03.280* :  why Donald Trump was saying this now.
*07:03.820- 07:05.900* :  Because he wants to be re-elected as president
*07:06.060- 07:10.100* :  and the fact that he has been involved or was involved in
*07:10.540- 07:13.720* :  appointing the three conservative Supreme Court justices
*07:13.720- 07:16.360* :  that helped overturn Roe v. Wade.
*07:16.360- 07:19.760* :  That was the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling
*07:19.760- 07:23.300* :  that enshrined and protected the constitutional right to an abortion.
*07:23.300- 07:26.420* :  That was overturned in 2022.
*07:27.180- 07:30.520* :  And Donald Trump had always said that that was part of his campaign
*07:30.520- 07:32.020* :  when he was first elected president.
*07:32.360- 07:35.340* :  But it has become increasingly challenging for Republicans
*07:35.340- 07:39.960* :  as many have been punished at the ballot box over that position.
*07:40.560- 07:44.260* :  And in effect, the issue of harder rules and tougher laws
*07:44.260- 07:47.140* :  on abortion bans has not played for Republicans
*07:47.140- 07:50.760* :  in a way that they might have liked in terms of elections.
*07:50.860- 07:53.140* :  So what we've seen is Donald Trump really
*07:53.140- 07:56.920* :  equivocating sort of wavering over whether there should be,
*07:56.920- 07:59.480* :  for example, a nationwide ban on abortion
*07:59.920- 08:02.040* :  at a certain term during the pregnancy.
*08:02.740- 08:05.660* :  And also has not committed himself, basically.
*08:06.020- 08:09.560* :  So what we had today was him saying, clarifying for the first time
*08:10.140- 08:12.680* :  that he backed the decisions being made by the states.
*08:12.900- 08:14.760* :  And therefore, he is effectively saying
*08:14.760- 08:18.260* :  there shouldn't be a nationwide imposed ban on abortion.
*08:18.840- 08:21.100* :  He'd been asked about whether or not he considered
*08:21.480- 08:23.460* :  15 weeks to be inappropriate time limit
*08:23.840- 08:25.940* :  abortions to be banned after that period.
*08:25.940- 08:29.360* :  It was thought that he was sort of leaning towards that position.
*08:29.820- 08:33.020* :  But now we know he says that that shouldn't be done nationwide,
*08:33.020- 08:35.360* :  that it should be up to the state.
*08:35.460- 08:38.140* :  So he is in effect moderating his position
*08:38.220- 08:39.900* :  from where he's been before.
*08:40.580- 08:43.300* :  And it shows, I think, the degree to which he is strategizing
*08:43.460- 08:45.360* :  ahead of the presidential election.
*08:45.360- 08:49.100* :  Republicans are accusing him of basically letting down
*08:49.100- 08:51.820* :  women who want to have the right to have abortions.
*08:52.180- 08:53.400* :  Tom Bateman in Washington.
*08:54.040- 08:56.720* :  Next to Gaza, Palestinians who've been returning
*08:56.720- 08:58.820* :  to the wrecked city of Khan Yunus
*08:59.120- 09:01.760* :  have spoken of the devastated landscape they've found
*09:01.760- 09:03.940* :  after months of intense fighting there.
*09:04.480- 09:07.080* :  Many residents found their houses in ruins with others
*09:07.080- 09:09.460* :  saying they couldn't actually locate their homes.
*09:10.000- 09:13.260* :  One resident, a mother of four, said the city smelt of death.
*09:13.760- 09:16.740* :  Israel says its troops have been pulled back from southern Gaza
*09:16.740- 09:20.440* :  to prepare for the next stage of its operation against Hamas.
*09:20.880- 09:23.200* :  Our Middle East correspondent, Lucy Williamson,
*09:23.200- 09:24.560* :  reports from Jerusalem.
*09:25.160- 09:27.800* :  For months, Khan Yunus was a city of targets.
*09:28.500- 09:30.760* :  Its homes and hospitals seen by Israel
*09:30.760- 09:32.620* :  as hiding places for Hamas.
*09:33.300- 09:37.260* :  Today, its residents returned to pick through its shattered landscape,
*09:37.340- 09:41.060* :  the concrete mountains that have replaced the city streets.
*09:44.580- 09:46.360* :  All I can say is God help us,
*09:46.620- 09:48.080* :  said Abu Saif Abu Mustafa.
*09:48.700- 09:50.220* :  Khan Yunus has been destroyed.
*09:50.220- 09:52.780* :  It's not fit for humans or animals.
*09:53.880- 09:55.680* :  Another resident, Muhammad Abu Rezek,
*09:56.120- 09:57.980* :  pointed out his house to the BBC.
*10:00.720- 10:02.740* :  I wasn't expecting this destruction.
*10:03.420- 10:04.440* :  My house is here.
*10:04.820- 10:06.500* :  Two floors are bombed.
*10:06.820- 10:09.980* :  One floor is burnt and was completely destroyed.
*10:10.560- 10:12.500* :  My wife was killed in the bombing.
*10:13.180- 10:14.320* :  Why were we refugees?
*10:14.960- 10:18.420* :  Our biggest request is that they withdraw from our land.
*10:18.900- 10:21.160* :  There has been enough destruction and killing.
*10:21.160- 10:25.020* :  It's better for us to have tents on the rubble of our home
*10:25.360- 10:26.780* :  rather than being displaced.
*10:27.440- 10:29.380* :  The withdrawal of troops from Khan Yunus
*10:29.660- 10:32.360* :  leaves Israel's army with just a skeleton presence
*10:32.360- 10:35.040* :  along a central band of the Gaza Strip.
*10:35.640- 10:38.560* :  BBC Verify has been examining satellite images
*10:38.560- 10:42.360* :  to assess the amount of damage caused by Israel's military action
*10:42.780- 10:44.100* :  in the Khan Yunus area.
*10:44.700- 10:46.140* :  Merlin Thomas has the details.
*10:46.660- 10:49.980* :  Looking at Gaza from space gives you an idea of the scale of destruction
*10:49.980- 10:53.000* :  that the Israeli military campaign has wrought across the territory.
*10:53.780- 10:56.720* :  We've been examining satellite imagery comparing images from before
*10:56.720- 10:58.880* :  and after troops advanced into Khan Yunus.
*10:59.640- 11:02.780* :  Satellite images from just before the intense Israeli air strikes in December
*11:02.780- 11:05.300* :  show a residential district that was densely populated
*11:05.820- 11:07.300* :  with bakeries and mosques.
*11:08.300- 11:12.580* :  Images taken last Wednesday show large sways of the city now flattened.
*11:13.260- 11:17.120* :  It's clear that row after row of buildings have been reduced to rubble.
*11:17.580- 11:19.480* :  According to data analysis of other images,
*11:19.920- 11:22.600* :  at least 55% of Khan Yunus has been destroyed.
*11:23.320- 11:25.360* :  That's the equivalent of more than eight square miles.
*11:26.120- 11:28.080* :  One football stadium that used to be a lush,
*11:28.080- 11:31.500* :  bright green patch among the concrete is barely recognizable.
*11:32.020- 11:34.260* :  Much of it has been completely churned up and destroyed,
*11:34.260- 11:37.440* :  like areas of farmland elsewhere in the Gaza Strip.
*11:37.900- 11:40.560* :  Against this background, the Israeli Defence Minister,
*11:40.560- 11:45.120* :  Yoav Gallant, has told Israeli troops that it's the right time to do a deal
*11:45.120- 11:48.080* :  to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza.
*11:48.600- 11:51.500* :  But he said such a move required difficult decisions,
*11:51.500- 11:53.680* :  as well as the approval of Hamas.
*11:54.100- 11:59.520* :  Mr Gallant's remarks come as talks continue in Cairo to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza
*11:59.900- 12:01.240* :  and the freeing of the hostages.
*12:01.240- 12:03.700* :  Qatar has been involved in the discussions.
*12:03.700- 12:07.560* :  A spokesman for the Qatari government, Majed Al Ansari,
*12:07.560- 12:10.360* :  told the BBC he was cautiously optimistic.
*12:10.380- 12:13.760* :  I can't go into the details of the set proposal,
*12:13.760- 12:16.440* :  but what I can tell you is that it bridges the gap
*12:16.800- 12:19.440* :  in a way that hasn't been done in the last couple of months.
*12:19.480- 12:22.240* :  And we hope that would lead to a more complex
*12:22.240- 12:24.260* :  that would lead to a positive result of an issue.
*12:24.860- 12:27.620* :  I asked our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Asher,
*12:27.780- 12:30.420* :  why the Israeli Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant,
*12:30.420- 12:32.700* :  was saying it's the right time to do a deal.
*12:33.120- 12:35.240* :  Well, depends what perspective, I guess,
*12:35.620- 12:37.860* :  it's being looked from, the way he was putting it
*12:38.560- 12:42.340* :  was that with the withdrawal of Israeli troops
*12:43.160- 12:47.560* :  from southern Gaza on Sunday, leaving just one brigade at the moment
*12:47.560- 12:48.960* :  in the hall of the territory,
*12:49.560- 12:53.320* :  it's a moment when Israel is in a position of strength
*12:53.320- 12:54.360* :  from his perspective.
*12:54.660- 12:56.680* :  He was speaking to Army recruits
*12:57.100- 12:59.740* :  that they've accomplished much of their mission.
*13:00.020- 13:01.180* :  That's where he's coming from.
*13:01.300- 13:04.380* :  And I mean, he was putting it not about the ceasefire,
*13:04.420- 13:06.900* :  but about the freeing of hostages.
*13:07.420- 13:11.580* :  And I mean, here, that has only become a bigger issue
*13:12.240- 13:13.760* :  week after week, day after day.
*13:13.760- 13:16.300* :  The protests, just a couple of days ago,
*13:16.820- 13:18.760* :  were immense for biggest so far.
*13:18.760- 13:21.380* :  So the pressure building on the government
*13:21.820- 13:23.320* :  has been intense.
*13:23.320- 13:28.240* :  From Hamas, as we've had before, we're getting conflicting signals.
*13:29.040- 13:31.960* :  Some signals, to be honest, not from Hamas itself,
*13:32.060- 13:36.160* :  but from the mediators from Qatar, from Egypt in particular,
*13:36.600- 13:39.160* :  where the latest round of talks has been happening in Cairo,
*13:39.640- 13:41.920* :  have already been very positive, saying, you know,
*13:41.920- 13:45.120* :  that the optimism they're feeling, they haven't felt for some time.
*13:45.580- 13:48.540* :  Now, I mean, we're hearing, as we have before,
*13:48.540- 13:53.160* :  from Hamas sources, that that isn't how Hamas is looking at it,
*13:53.200- 13:56.160* :  and that they're actually taking a more negative view.
*13:56.680- 14:01.020* :  And so, how does this square with the calls from Benjamin Netanyahu
*14:01.380- 14:04.440* :  for a continued offensive in the town of Rafa?
*14:04.760- 14:06.200* :  Well, again, I guess it depends
*14:06.220- 14:10.540* :  the way that it's being looked at from Benjamin Netanyahu's
*14:10.860- 14:14.840* :  stance. He doesn't feel that he is saying anything different
*14:14.840- 14:17.960* :  from what his message has been for some time.
*14:17.960- 14:21.000* :  I mean, he upped the rhetoric in his latest address,
*14:21.640- 14:25.080* :  saying that a date has been set for the incursion in Rafa.
*14:25.760- 14:28.460* :  I think most people would take that with a pinch of salt.
*14:28.660- 14:30.140* :  I mean, it's a military operation,
*14:30.640- 14:33.820* :  setting a date is a hard-nuffing at any time,
*14:33.820- 14:35.700* :  particularly with an operation like this.
*14:35.700- 14:38.060* :  But, you know, the message was, we are going ahead.
*14:38.420- 14:41.300* :  Now, that doesn't necessarily rule out a ceasefire.
*14:41.840- 14:45.300* :  What Israel, the government, and the military being saying,
*14:45.300- 14:49.300* :  is we're not against a ceasefire deal,
*14:49.660- 14:51.780* :  not a permanent ceasefire for six weeks,
*14:51.820- 14:54.080* :  something like that. That's what's being talked about.
*14:55.060- 14:58.180* :  But we will go back and finish the fight afterwards.
*14:58.740- 15:00.740* :  And that means Rafa to some degree.
*15:00.740- 15:04.120* :  That's what Benjamin Netanyahu is still standing by
*15:04.520- 15:05.660* :  and delivering that rhetoric.
*15:05.660- 15:08.940* :  Now, that's uncomfortable for Israel's closest ally,
*15:08.940- 15:12.920* :  the US, which has become far more critical in recent weeks
*15:13.520- 15:14.540* :  of the Israeli government.
*15:14.980- 15:18.420* :  And very much about any intention to go into Rafa
*15:18.420- 15:21.300* :  that could cause more death and destruction there,
*15:21.300- 15:23.120* :  where more than a million Palestinians
*15:23.120- 15:26.000* :  who've been displaced from elsewhere are taking refuge.
*15:26.000- 15:30.380* :  So, this is not a message that America and Israel's allies
*15:30.380- 15:32.500* :  want to hear at this moment.
*15:33.180- 15:34.880* :  Sebastian Asher in Jerusalem.
*15:35.760- 15:39.200* :  It's estimated that 65 million people across the world
*15:39.200- 15:41.460* :  are suffering from the illness Long COVID,
*15:41.880- 15:43.200* :  which has a range of symptoms,
*15:43.200- 15:45.640* :  including breathlessness, problems with memory,
*15:45.640- 15:48.000* :  joint pain, and gut or stomach problems.
*15:48.660- 15:50.760* :  Tracy Evans from England is one of them.
*15:50.940- 15:54.340* :  She spent time on a ventilator in hospital three years ago.
*15:54.740- 15:56.300* :  I have fatigue, so bad.
*15:56.800- 16:00.480* :  Even just changing a pillowcase on a bed is breathless.
*16:01.220- 16:04.120* :  I can't walk far, even to the local shop,
*16:04.140- 16:05.920* :  which isn't far. I can't walk.
*16:06.600- 16:07.800* :  I'm tired all the time.
*16:08.320- 16:10.180* :  I have shoulder pains all over my body.
*16:10.800- 16:12.440* :  I've got really bad brain fog.
*16:13.160- 16:15.300* :  The symptoms can develop weeks or months
*16:15.300- 16:17.620* :  after you catch the COVID-19 virus.
*16:18.060- 16:19.460* :  And with no treatments available,
*16:19.460- 16:20.680* :  they can last for years.
*16:21.400- 16:24.780* :  So far, Long COVID has proved to be very hard to detect.
*16:25.380- 16:28.080* :  But now, new research has found that the virus leaves
*16:28.080- 16:30.220* :  tell-tale signs in patients' blood,
*16:30.620- 16:32.320* :  which could be targets for treatments.
*16:32.320- 16:35.580* :  I've been talking to our health reporter, Philippa Roxby.
*16:36.100- 16:39.520* :  It's difficult to measure the impact of Long COVID globally,
*16:39.520- 16:42.660* :  but what we think is that one in every 10 people
*16:42.700- 16:47.320* :  who was infected by COVID could then have these long lasting symptoms.
*16:47.360- 16:48.600* :  And that's what Long COVID is,
*16:48.600- 16:50.740* :  when the symptoms of COVID,
*16:50.740- 16:53.580* :  and they can be anything from brain fog to fatigue,
*16:53.580- 16:56.160* :  to anxiety, to muscle pains,
*16:56.160- 16:58.340* :  when they continue for a long time afterwards.
*16:58.760- 17:02.080* :  Usually it's for at least another 12 weeks afterwards.
*17:02.080- 17:04.660* :  And for some people, they last for many months
*17:04.680- 17:05.940* :  and sometimes even years.
*17:06.660- 17:10.880* :  And so far, what do we know about what causes Long COVID?
*17:11.180- 17:13.100* :  Well, there's been a lot of research into it
*17:13.100- 17:14.580* :  since the pandemic started.
*17:14.580- 17:17.540* :  We're still in the very early stages of really understanding
*17:17.980- 17:19.220* :  what causes it.
*17:19.500- 17:21.560* :  But there are some things we do know.
*17:21.560- 17:26.200* :  We do know that people can have indications in their heart
*17:26.200- 17:30.080* :  and in their lung of scarring after COVID,
*17:30.400- 17:31.840* :  and they can continue.
*17:32.540- 17:35.280* :  We know that it can affect people who are very severely ill
*17:35.280- 17:39.220* :  with COVID, but also people who were very mildly ill,
*17:39.280- 17:40.540* :  just had mild infections.
*17:40.620- 17:42.680* :  They can also be infected for a long time.
*17:43.960- 17:46.680* :  We know that there may be something to do with blood
*17:46.740- 17:50.920* :  clots in the brain that could be causing brain fog.
*17:51.560- 17:54.840* :  But all these research findings are in their very early stages.
*17:54.840- 17:56.800* :  There's still an awful lot we don't know.
*17:57.220- 17:58.760* :  And scientists are very keen to find out
*17:58.800- 18:00.900* :  because clearly many millions of people around the world
*18:01.060- 18:02.280* :  could be affected by this.
*18:02.580- 18:04.660* :  So this new study that's been released
*18:04.660- 18:06.580* :  by Imperial College here in London,
*18:07.140- 18:08.400* :  what does this show us?
*18:08.440- 18:10.920* :  What does this tell us that is going to move us forward?
*18:11.920- 18:15.700* :  Well, it shows that people who were severely ill
*18:15.700- 18:19.200* :  with COVID in hospital, those who then had
*18:19.200- 18:23.580* :  these long-lasting COVID symptoms six months later,
*18:23.580- 18:25.900* :  they looked at their blood, they analyzed their blood,
*18:25.900- 18:28.240* :  and they found that there was evidence
*18:28.240- 18:31.100* :  of inflammatory markers in their blood.
*18:31.520- 18:33.640* :  And usually that happens when the immune system
*18:33.640- 18:36.120* :  is fighting off an infection, so in the middle of COVID.
*18:36.120- 18:39.160* :  But it's very unusual to see that six months down the line.
*18:39.680- 18:42.720* :  And they also found out that those different inflammatory markers,
*18:42.720- 18:43.540* :  there were patterns.
*18:43.560- 18:46.600* :  So those people who were suffering from fatigue or brain fog
*18:46.620- 18:48.540* :  had slightly different inflammatory markers
*18:48.540- 18:51.160* :  than people who were suffering from maybe anxiety
*18:51.160- 18:53.260* :  or had gut problems or other issues.
*18:53.600- 18:55.220* :  So there was a slight pattern there.
*18:55.760- 18:57.720* :  And they think that might help in the future
*18:57.720- 19:01.620* :  to direct where research should go into treatments.
*19:01.620- 19:03.760* :  We're still, again, at the very early stages,
*19:03.980- 19:06.220* :  but it's something, something a bit more
*19:06.440- 19:08.700* :  than we knew yesterday about long COVID
*19:08.700- 19:11.380* :  and it could lead to other research.
*19:11.920- 19:12.820* :  Philippa Rooksby.
*19:15.840- 19:18.360* :  Still to come, guess who's joining TikTok?
*19:24.840- 19:27.080* :  He says he's definitely not going to dance,
*19:27.080- 19:29.140* :  find out who he is in a few minutes.
*19:38.100- 19:40.040* :  How would you like to look five years younger
*19:40.400- 19:43.120* :  In a clinical study, people that had volume added
*19:43.120- 19:45.700* :  with Juvederm Voluma XC in the cheeks
*19:45.960- 19:48.440* :  perceive themselves as looking five years younger
*19:48.440- 19:50.160* :  at six months after treatment.
*19:50.160- 19:52.500* :  Look younger, feel like you.
*19:52.720- 19:55.180* :  Add volume for lift and contour in the cheeks
*19:55.180- 19:57.160* :  with Juvederm Voluma XC.
*19:57.420- 19:59.620* :  Reverse signs of aging by adding volume

*21:13.720- 21:15.720* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*21:15.720- 21:20.240* :  The medical charity Med Sanson Frontier has made an urgent appeal
*21:20.240- 21:24.000* :  for humanitarian agencies that have suspended work in Sudan
*21:24.000- 21:25.500* :  to return to the country.
*21:26.140- 21:30.000* :  Nearly a year after fighting began between rival military factions,
*21:30.000- 21:34.580* :  MSF said a colossal humanitarian crisis was taking place.
*21:35.100- 21:36.960* :  Nearly five million people in Sudan
*21:36.960- 21:39.060* :  face emergency levels of hunger.
*21:39.600- 21:42.460* :  One aid agency, the Norwegian refugee council,
*21:42.460- 21:45.860* :  recently warned of the grave danger of an epic famine.
*21:46.580- 21:49.180* :  I spoke to our Africa correspondent Ann Sawy
*21:49.460- 21:52.500* :  and first asked her why the conflict in Sudan had begun.
*21:53.180- 21:56.060* :  War broke out nearly almost exactly a year ago
*21:56.100- 21:58.500* :  on the 15th of April last year.
*21:59.100- 22:02.380* :  Between two very armed forces of Sudan,
*22:02.380- 22:06.700* :  the National Army and the Rapid Support Forces,
*22:06.700- 22:10.040* :  which was a paramilitary unit created by government
*22:10.940- 22:12.340* :  to support the army.
*22:12.900- 22:16.280* :  The generals leading these two forces
*22:16.700- 22:19.820* :  had been in a power sharing agreement leading the country.
*22:20.440- 22:23.840* :  And then there was a power fallout, a political fallout,
*22:24.260- 22:28.560* :  which then descended into fighting between these two groups.
*22:29.320- 22:32.260* :  Now civilians were caught in the middle of this
*22:32.360- 22:36.380* :  and they are the ones who have borne the biggest brunt of this war.
*22:37.520- 22:39.900* :  Millions have been displaced both internally
*22:39.900- 22:41.260* :  and to neighboring countries.
*22:41.260- 22:43.540* :  And when we talk about neighboring countries,
*22:44.180- 22:47.260* :  the conditions have been really dire.
*22:47.520- 22:49.380* :  We're talking about South Sudan that itself
*22:49.380- 22:55.520* :  has a serious humanitarian bad in back home.
*22:55.900- 22:58.800* :  We're talking about the Central African Republic, Chad.
*22:59.500- 23:02.380* :  So things have been very difficult for Sudanese.
*23:02.420- 23:04.180* :  And today we've heard from MSF,
*23:04.220- 23:08.880* :  one of the last charities that are trying to help people in Sudan.
*23:10.080- 23:13.880* :  They're talking about the collapse of the public health care system.
*23:13.880- 23:16.100* :  It was already on its knees before the war.
*23:16.460- 23:19.460* :  And now between two thirds and three quarters
*23:19.760- 23:22.900* :  of health facilities are not functioning at all.
*23:23.880- 23:27.680* :  And even they are having difficulty bringing in medical supplies.
*23:28.280- 23:31.420* :  We have heard about boxes being opened.
*23:31.420- 23:35.480* :  And if any surgical supplies are found, they are blocked.
*23:35.540- 23:36.960* :  They are not allowed to go in.
*23:37.320- 23:41.280* :  Because the thinking is that they are going to help treat those
*23:41.280- 23:44.200* :  who are wounded in the war and they could be combatants.
*23:45.000- 23:49.700* :  International law allows for combatants to be treated.
*23:50.420- 23:51.920* :  However, those are not being allowed.
*23:51.920- 23:54.760* :  And the consequences that they cannot even perform
*23:55.080- 23:59.620* :  cesarean section to save mothers who are having difficulties giving birth.
*24:00.280- 24:05.800* :  And so, and staying in Africa, reports from Marley say more than 100 people have died
*24:05.800- 24:08.740* :  in an extreme heat wave, which has seen temperatures
*24:08.740- 24:12.940* :  saw to more than 45 degrees Celsius over the past four days.
*24:13.480- 24:16.280* :  The BBC's Makoji Okafo has more details.
*24:17.000- 24:18.860* :  One of the largest hospitals in Bamako,
*24:19.020- 24:22.040* :  Gabriel Ture University hospitals says that the most affected
*24:22.040- 24:25.260* :  are people over 60 years and with chronic illnesses.
*24:25.840- 24:29.800* :  Dr. Bouvac Agnieri, the Deputy Secretary-General for Marley and Dr. Zunion,
*24:30.120- 24:32.000* :  told the BBC that they are deeply concerned
*24:32.000- 24:35.000* :  that dozens of people have died due to the heat wave
*24:35.240- 24:38.080* :  and the government is looking to find solutions to make sure
*24:38.480- 24:41.120* :  everyone be protected in the temperature rises again.
*24:41.740- 24:43.940* :  The country's health ministry issued a warning
*24:43.940- 24:45.760* :  advising people to stay hydrated,
*24:46.320- 24:49.840* :  avoid intense activities as they indoors from midday to evening.
*24:50.300- 24:54.280* :  China has said it should be allowed to have a normal relationship with Russia
*24:54.280- 24:58.760* :  after the US warned Beijing not to support Moscow's war in Ukraine.
*24:58.780- 25:03.780* :  A Chinese government spokesman said the country's ties with Russia should not be disrupted
*25:04.140- 25:07.880* :  or restricted. The US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen,
*25:07.880- 25:10.140* :  who's been on a four-day visit to China,
*25:10.520- 25:14.780* :  said Chinese businesses could face sanctions if they helped Russia's war effort.
*25:15.380- 25:18.740* :  And during the trip, Miss Yellen had this message for her hosts.
*25:19.360- 25:24.320* :  China is now simply too large for the rest of the world
*25:25.000- 25:27.260* :  to absorb this enormous capacity.
*25:27.900- 25:32.460* :  Actions taken by the PRC today can shift world prices.
*25:33.860- 25:38.440* :  And when the global market is flooded by artificially cheap Chinese products,
*25:39.380- 25:44.340* :  the viability of American and other foreign firms is put into question.
*25:45.180- 25:48.700* :  With more on the importance of the US Treasury Secretary's visit,
*25:48.700- 25:51.960* :  here's the BBC's Chinese media analyst, Kerry Allen.
*25:52.340- 25:56.000* :  Whenever US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen meets with Chinese officials,
*25:56.000- 25:59.520* :  you'll see lots of positive language used in Chinese newspapers.
*26:00.200- 26:02.500* :  She's very much regarded as a friend to China,
*26:02.660- 26:07.640* :  and a key figure in bringing the US and China closer together after years of strained ties
*26:07.640- 26:11.960* :  amid an ongoing trade war. I'm seeing phrases today amid her China visit like
*26:11.960- 26:16.820* :  hope, a positive sign, removing barriers and stabilising relations.
*26:17.480- 26:19.360* :  I'm even seeing the word chuminess.
*26:20.080- 26:24.640* :  And long-term state media have spoken about how they appreciate that Janet Yellen has a relatively
*26:24.640- 26:29.480* :  pragmatic attitude towards China. There's a general feeling that many other US figures
*26:29.480- 26:34.460* :  who have had high-level exchanges with Chinese officials have either sought to bully or suppress
*26:34.460- 26:39.420* :  the country. But the China Daily newspaper says, compared with many other US officials,
*26:39.900- 26:42.900* :  Yellen knows China better and she has direct experience.
*26:43.700- 26:48.140* :  Before flying to China, Secretary Yellen said her China visit this time was to advance
*26:48.140- 26:53.780* :  a healthy economic relationship. And from Beijing's perspective, a healthy relationship features
*26:54.180- 26:59.400* :  openness, equality and mutual benefits. And these are qualities that China feels Yellen
*26:59.400- 27:04.240* :  understands. Today, Chinese audiences are watching footage of her enjoying a meal at a
*27:04.240- 27:08.760* :  Chinese restaurant in Beijing, and they're speaking of how she used to regularly enjoy
*27:08.760- 27:12.880* :  the Chinese food while teaching at Berkeley. Since arriving in China last Thursday,
*27:12.880- 27:18.460* :  Alice has been saying that she's had in-depth, candid, pragmatic and constructive exchanges
*27:18.460- 27:23.360* :  with Chinese counterparts. And China has had high regards for Yellen reiterating that she
*27:23.360- 27:28.080* :  rejects the idea of decoupling economically from China, saying that doing so would bring
*27:28.080- 27:33.980* :  quote, disastrous consequences. If there has been a sore point, it's been comments that she's made
*27:33.980- 27:39.720* :  on how China's excess capacity has distorted global prices and hurt American firms and workers.
*27:40.440- 27:44.880* :  Media have highlighted that this has been a point of disagreement, and one paper says there's a
*27:44.880- 27:49.320* :  belief in China that this could be a pretext for more crackdowns on Chinese products and businesses.
*27:50.200- 27:55.480* :  Kerry Yellen, with elections taking place around the world this year, we know that politicians
*27:55.480- 28:00.640* :  will be flocking to social media platforms like Facebook and X to get their message across
*28:00.640- 28:07.080* :  to voters. But now, a few brave leaders have decided to go one step further and launch themselves
*28:07.080- 28:13.220* :  on TikTok. But is the app known for its short dance videos the right platform for them,
*28:13.560- 28:16.800* :  or are they playing with fire? Alfie Habishan reports.
*28:23.240- 28:28.380* :  Not the kind of music you might associate with the sober leadership style of German Chancellor
*28:28.380- 28:34.040* :  Olaf Schultz. But it's him alright. His first video shows a pair of white trainers
*28:34.040- 28:38.940* :  strolling across a carpet floor. Before the camera slowly pans up to the man himself,
*28:38.940- 28:44.980* :  staring back mischievously from his desk. And he's not the only one taking the TikTok plunge.
*28:45.220- 28:49.480* :  As European elections approach in June, politicians are hoping to grab the attention of
*28:49.480- 28:54.880* :  scrolling 16-year-olds, who in Germany, Belgium, Austria and Malta are all allowed to vote.
*28:55.720- 28:59.980* :  Meanwhile, Mr Schultz's competition, the far-right alternative for Germany party,
*28:59.980- 29:05.760* :  are ahead of the game, with half a million followers. But it's never too late to get involved.
*29:05.760- 29:12.880* :  Just ask 81-year-old US President Joe Biden. He joined in February, during the Super Bowl.
*29:13.420- 29:19.080* :  Chiefs are Niners. Two great quarterbacks harder to decide, but if I didn't say I was for the
*29:19.080- 29:23.120* :  Eagles, then I'd be sleeping along my wife's fulfilling her own. Jason Kelsey or Travis Kelsey?
*29:23.380- 29:26.100* :  Mama Kelsey, I understand she makes great chocolate chip cookies.
*29:27.500- 29:28.980* :  Drummer Biden. Are you kidding?
*29:30.300- 29:34.680* :  Biden. Most leaders use the app to deliver short and snappy policy messages.
*29:35.280- 29:39.460* :  But for others, it's a chance to strip off the suit and just look a bit more natural.
*29:40.000- 29:44.240* :  At home, reclined on the sofa, or if you're the French president and manual Macron,
*29:44.240- 29:50.780* :  fresh from around of sparring in the boxing gym. But is there a bit more at stake here than public
*29:50.780- 29:56.380* :  embarrassment? Because German security agents use advice against Mr Schultz's new hobby.
*29:57.120- 30:01.700* :  They say that TikTok is probably sharing its user data with the Chinese government.
*30:02.640- 30:06.660* :  And for the same reason, UK politicians are already banned from using the app altogether.
*30:07.500- 30:12.360* :  Mr Biden says he will sign the bill to ban TikTok in America if it passes through the Senate.
*30:13.040- 30:16.900* :  But he seems a bit torn by getting the most out of it in the meantime,
*30:16.900- 30:23.300* :  with a looming election runoff against Donald Trump later this year, who is hardly shy on social media
*30:23.880- 30:28.760* :  himself. For the German Chancellor Schultz, it remains to be seen whether his attempt to get the
*30:28.760- 30:35.780* :  youth on side will be worth the risks. But it may be a relief to know, whatever his next video,
*30:35.780- 30:41.560* :  he says he will not be dancing. Thank goodness for that. Alfie Habeson reporting.
*30:42.300- 30:47.700* :  Now back to our main story, tens of millions of skygazers witness the total eclipse of the Sun
*30:47.700- 30:53.700* :  that swept across a broad swath of North America on Monday. For Professor Sheila O'Moron,
*30:53.700- 30:59.040* :  who has a visual impairment, it was a special day in bowling green in the US state of Ohio.
*30:59.680- 31:04.140* :  I can see light and dark, but I don't have any useful vision. So for me, I think what was the most
*31:04.140- 31:09.280* :  amazing thing was to get the sense of the size of the moon because it was going at about a thousand
*31:09.280- 31:14.680* :  miles an hour. And the idea that you can sort of sense the edge because really you don't
*31:15.160- 31:21.080* :  sort of experience the darkness until the moon has completely blocked the Sun. And then as soon
*31:21.080- 31:26.060* :  as the Sun comes back, the light comes back and the warmth comes back. So you really get a sense of
*31:26.060- 31:31.620* :  the edges of the size of the moon, which is quite incredible. The sound does change, it becomes the
*31:31.620- 31:36.300* :  sound of night time. And although it wasn't quite enough where I was to hear insects, you do get that
*31:36.300- 31:41.580* :  sense of kind of dulling like you do when it's dark. And obviously the temperature change is the
*31:41.580- 31:47.860* :  main thing. You know, you get the wind as the moon approaches total eclipse, you get transition from
*31:47.860- 31:53.360* :  the heat of the sun to the cool of the shadow. And so that's one thing that you notice and then
*31:53.360- 31:58.720* :  it is, you know, as cool as it would be in the evening. And a note for your diary, the next total
*31:58.720- 32:06.620* :  solar eclipse will be in 2026. It will be visible over the Arctic Ocean and to some people in Europe.
*32:09.680- 32:14.340* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
