*01:22.040- 01:24.980* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Center.
*01:26.520- 01:31.260* :  I'm Janet Jalil and in the early hours of Tuesday the 16th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:32.040- 01:38.560* :  Donald Trump has made legal history by becoming the first former US President to stand trial in a criminal case.
*01:39.600- 01:44.940* :  Delegates at an aid conference in Paris called to mark one year since Sudan's civil war began
*01:45.400- 01:48.640* :  have pledged more than $2 billion in donations.
*01:49.800- 01:55.180* :  A movie weapon supervisor on the film Rust has been sentenced to 18 months in prison
*01:55.580- 01:57.900* :  for the fatal shooting of a cinematographer.
*02:00.500- 02:06.340* :  Also in this podcast, record ocean temperatures have caused the mass bleaching of Coral
*02:06.700- 02:08.100* :  across the world's seas.
*02:11.700- 02:16.320* :  We hear why the loss of the sound the Coral makes is a disaster for marine life.
*02:20.780- 02:24.820* :  Donald Trump's longer-weighted hushed money trial has begun in New York.
*02:25.600- 02:30.460* :  It's the first time that a US President, former or current, has faced a criminal trial.
*02:31.200- 02:37.020* :  Mr. Trump is accused of falsifying his business records to try to conceal a payment of $130,000
*02:37.020- 02:42.500* :  to an adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election which he won.
*02:43.120- 02:48.400* :  He denies the charges and made this statement to reporters after leaving the courtroom in New York.
*03:11.140- 03:16.800* :  The initial phase of jury selection sold dozens of potential jurors excused after saying they
*03:16.800- 03:22.020* :  could not be impartial. A correspondent, Nedotovik, was at the court and gave us this update.
*03:22.780- 03:27.360* :  This is, of course, the first former president to face criminal charges, but we have to remember
*03:27.360- 03:31.360* :  this is happening as he's also seeking a return to the White House.
*03:31.360- 03:37.100* :  And so for both of those reasons, we are really seeing Donald Trump test both the political
*03:37.100- 03:43.620* :  and legal norms of this country in a way no one ever has before. You think back to Nixon and
*03:43.620- 03:49.700* :  Watergate? Well, Gerald Ford pardoned the former president Nixon. And so certainly this has
*03:49.700- 03:55.560* :  leapt the United States into unprecedented territory and has raised all sorts of questions
*03:56.080- 03:59.140* :  about what happens if Donald Trump is convicted in this case.
*04:00.180- 04:06.720* :  Just talk us through how this will unfold. This is just the first day a jury needs to be selected
*04:07.360- 04:10.440* :  before the trial can begin and that's likely to be a long difficult process.
*04:12.260- 04:17.360* :  That's exactly right and keep in mind that a lot of times they say cases are one or lost
*04:17.380- 04:23.560* :  on jury selection. That's how important this process is and that's because jurors will either
*04:23.560- 04:30.180* :  vote to at the end to say that Donald Trump is guilty, not guilty, or if they can't decide, if just
*04:30.380- 04:35.560* :  one juror holds up a unanimous decision, it could be a hung jury which would result in a mistrial.
*04:36.100- 04:40.200* :  Now, these are people that are going to be answering what the judge has described as the most
*04:40.200- 04:45.220* :  extensive questionnaire the court has put forward. More than 40 questions on that questionnaire
*04:45.780- 04:49.600* :  that deal with what kind of media they consume if they've ever gone to a Trump rally,
*04:49.600- 04:54.720* :  if they're a part of any extremist groups, and then both sides will be able to strike out certain
*04:54.720- 05:00.180* :  jurors they don't want. There'll be further questioning to ensure that jurors picked can be
*05:00.180- 05:06.060* :  impartial, no matter how they feel about Donald Trump as a person, and so that could take a week
*05:06.060- 05:12.360* :  to two weeks. We'll see how that process unfolds, but altogether this trial is expected to last
*05:12.360- 05:18.100* :  up to eight weeks. And I think what a lot of people will find surprising is that even if Mr. Trump
*05:18.100- 05:23.960* :  is found guilty and put in prison, he could still possibly become president.
*05:24.680- 05:31.180* :  That's absolutely right. It is a matter for the voters. This is perhaps the only one of the four
*05:31.180- 05:38.300* :  criminal trials he faces that is going to happen before the election in November. And so in that
*05:38.300- 05:44.560* :  sense, many say it's playing a little bit of an outsized role. How will that impact, for example,
*05:44.620- 05:50.220* :  independent voters? I mean, if you look at polling, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are neck to neck.
*05:50.800- 05:57.260* :  So even if he is a convicted felon as a result of this trial, he would not only be able to run,
*05:57.260- 06:03.420* :  but be able to serve as president if he wins. Now, many say it's unlikely he'll get jail time
*06:03.420- 06:08.200* :  in this case, because even though the sentencing guidelines call for up to four years of prison,
*06:08.800- 06:12.700* :  somebody who is a first-time offender, for example, can often get probation,
*06:12.700- 06:16.860* :  ultimately that's a decision that's up for the judge. But if Donald Trump, for example,
*06:16.860- 06:22.340* :  was sent to prison and was elected president, well, that just throws the United States into, again,
*06:22.340- 06:28.600* :  uncharted territory. Nidah Tulfik was the more bad news for Donald Trump. The value of shares
*06:28.600- 06:34.360* :  in the social media site he launched has fallen sharply following the announcement of plans to
*06:34.360- 06:39.300* :  allow investors, including the former president, to sell them. On North America business correspondent
*06:39.420- 06:44.780* :  Michelle Flurry reports from New York. The company behind the true social platform has told
*06:44.780- 06:51.100* :  financial regulators that it plans to issue almost 21.5 million new shares to the public to raise more
*06:51.100- 06:58.200* :  money. Trump media is also looking for approval to potentially resell up to 146 million shares
*06:58.200- 07:03.540* :  held by current investors, including the former president, who is the majority shareholder.
*07:04.280- 07:09.260* :  The move paves the way for them to be able to cash in sooner, currently they are barred from
*07:09.260- 07:14.700* :  any share sale until September. Once the Securities and Exchange Commission signs off on this
*07:14.700- 07:20.080* :  filing, insiders, including Mr. Trump, can seek board approval to start selling stock.
*07:20.140- 07:26.260* :  The price of Trump media's shares dropped almost 13% shortly after the US stock market opened,
*07:26.260- 07:32.480* :  extending its slump. The struggling company, which went public in March, is rapidly losing money
*07:32.480- 07:38.980* :  and a new stock offering could help it stay afloat. Michelle Flurry, an international conference
*07:38.980- 07:45.040* :  in Paris has raised more than $2 billion in financial support for Sudan. It's been a year since
*07:45.040- 07:50.160* :  civil war erupted between the army and a rival paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces.
*07:50.660- 07:56.860* :  Around 9 million people have been displaced since then, and tens of millions are facing a hunger
*07:56.860- 08:02.800* :  crisis. But much of the global attention has been focused on other conflicts. The head of the
*08:02.800- 08:07.940* :  United Nations and Tony Gutierrez called on the international community to provide more aid.
*08:08.540- 08:13.180* :  The Sudanese people desperately need the support and generosity of the global community
*08:13.260- 08:19.600* :  to help them through this nightmare. The 2.7 billion humanitarian response plan for Sudan
*08:20.500- 08:27.340* :  was only 6% funded before the conference. And 1.4 billion regional refugee response plan
*08:27.340- 08:33.940* :  for the Sudan crisis only 7%. Tim Frank spoke to Isabel Coleman, the deputy
*08:34.560- 08:39.580* :  administrator of USAID, the United States Agency for International Development. She's been
*08:39.580- 08:44.660* :  attending the conference in Paris. So what's her reaction to the aid pledge there for Sudan?
*08:45.560- 08:51.220* :  We're thrilled with the outcome today. Sudan is one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world
*08:51.220- 08:57.700* :  today. And I think prior to this event, the commitments for this year for Sudan were
*08:57.700- 09:08.180* :  woefully insufficient. The UN does an appeal every year. And last year, they met over 40% of that
*09:08.180- 09:13.840* :  appeal with the United States alone, contributing more than a billion dollars to Sudan.
*09:14.740- 09:22.580* :  This year, the humanitarian response plan had been woefully met to date around 5% or 6%.
*09:23.180- 09:30.460* :  And today's pledging conference really goes a long way to really making up the gap that existed.
*09:30.960- 09:35.940* :  Right. I mean, you mentioned that the US last year contributed a billion dollars. I mean,
*09:35.940- 09:42.920* :  the figures that I've got from USAID in terms of what's been committed to them
*09:43.580- 09:52.640* :  in the 2024 fiscal year has a Sudan at about $200 million in your list of top 10 recipients.
*09:52.640- 09:59.660* :  It comes in number seven. So is that where we are in the current financial year?
*10:00.040- 10:06.960* :  Yes, it starts October 1. So we're about halfway through our current financial year.
*10:07.140- 10:12.160* :  Okay. But I mean, it does suggest that despite the fact that you and others are describing it as
*10:12.160- 10:16.840* :  one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, I mean, just in terms of the amount of money that
*10:17.440- 10:23.440* :  the US has pledged just in the last six months. I mean, it's not as much as some other places.
*10:25.040- 10:30.220* :  You're looking just at the USAID figures. Yeah. And our State Department also contributes funding.
*10:30.800- 10:37.100* :  Okay. When it comes to getting humanitarian aid in, I mean, what we're hearing again and again,
*10:37.100- 10:40.860* :  and I'm sure you're hearing the same thing from the people you're speaking to is that
*10:41.760- 10:47.860* :  it may be good news that more money is now being pledged. But I mean, obviously aid is about
*10:48.340- 10:53.960* :  more than just figures is also about distribution. What can you possibly do to try and make that
*10:54.900- 10:58.560* :  better, smoother whilst conflict is raging inside Sudan?
*10:59.640- 11:05.300* :  Well, that is the task of humanitarian heroes around the world. And it's no different in this case
*11:05.300- 11:11.400* :  in Sudan. I mean, we as the US government have been putting a lot of effort into the diplomacy
*11:11.440- 11:17.760* :  on this conflict. And I know that my government colleagues are doing everything they can with
*11:17.760- 11:24.660* :  both parties to the conflict, both the RSF and the SAF to increase both cross-border and cross-line
*11:24.720- 11:29.100* :  within the country access to those who need it most for humanitarian assistance.
*11:29.680- 11:34.000* :  I'm sure efforts are being made, but I mean, what we've seen over the last year is
*11:34.700- 11:41.280* :  looting from the RSF and their forces, their paramilitary forces, an incredible bureaucratic obstacles
*11:42.020- 11:46.940* :  placed in the way of the distribution of aid by the regular army, the Sudanese armed forces.
*11:47.860- 11:53.960* :  Not to say, of course, the fact that the insecurity and the fragmented forces that are now piling in
*11:53.960- 12:01.000* :  just means that it is a it's incredibly difficult and dangerous work to do. So I'm sure efforts
*12:01.000- 12:06.740* :  are being made, but I just what is going to change this? Getting the parties back to the
*12:06.740- 12:14.560* :  negotiating table is absolutely urgent. And as part of that, making it very clear that
*12:15.640- 12:22.120* :  starving the people of Sudan is not only against international humanitarian law, but you know,
*12:22.120- 12:28.980* :  potentially a war crime. I mean, making sure that the perpetrators really understand
*12:30.000- 12:35.520* :  that what they're doing and getting their political backers in the region to really bring
*12:35.520- 12:43.480* :  pressure to bear on them too. Isabel Coleman of USAID. The world is watching closely to see what
*12:43.480- 12:49.840* :  Israel's next move will be following Iran's unprecedented attack on the Jewish state on Saturday
*12:50.300- 12:55.960* :  night. Israel's war cabinet met for a second day on Monday and is vowing to respond despite
*12:55.960- 13:01.800* :  countries, including France and Britain, urging against an escalation. The United States has said
*13:01.800- 13:08.160* :  it won't take part in any Israeli counterattack against Iran. Iran says it launched hundreds of
*13:08.160- 13:13.380* :  missiles and drones on Saturday night in revenge for an attack on its consulate in Syria earlier
*13:13.380- 13:19.400* :  this month that killed senior Iranian officials. Israel managed to intercept nearly all of them with
*13:19.400- 13:25.180* :  the help of allies, including the US, the UK and Jordan. James Landel reports from Jerusalem.
*13:26.120- 13:30.780* :  It's now clear that Israel will retaliate against Iran for the mass missile and drone attack
*13:30.780- 13:36.320* :  it launched over the weekend. In a statement on social media, Mr Netanyahu accused Iran of
*13:36.320- 13:42.360* :  conducting a full-scale campaign of aggression that threatened not only Israel, but also the
*13:42.360- 13:47.920* :  entire Middle East. The international community, he said, must continue to stand united in resisting
*13:47.920- 13:53.500* :  that aggression. The head of Israel's army, Herzi Halavi, visited the never-tim airbase that was
*13:53.500- 14:00.360* :  likely damaged. As we look ahead, we consider our steps and this launch of so many missiles,
*14:00.360- 14:06.320* :  cruise missiles and drones into the territory of the state of Israel will be met with a response.
*14:06.640- 14:12.400* :  Israel's war cabinet met for the second time in 24 hours amid growing rumors that some kind of
*14:12.400- 14:16.760* :  retaliatory action was imminent. But it was also reported that the cabinet was divided
*14:17.220- 14:21.920* :  about how and when. That uncertainty was reflected on the streets of Jerusalem.
*14:22.720- 14:26.040* :  What I really think has to happen is we need to hit them, we need to hit them hard,
*14:26.040- 14:30.020* :  they need to realize this is not the kind of behavior they can be tolerated. I'm not recommending
*14:30.020- 14:35.200* :  that we destroy their nuclear facilities, but if they did it, I wouldn't have a problem with it.
*14:35.460- 14:41.100* :  We don't need to do anything in a rush. We should wear with it because revenge is a meal that
*14:41.120- 14:47.100* :  should be presented cold. I'd like you to respond, but I also know that there are more complicated
*14:47.100- 14:51.080* :  things and there's a whole world to think about and the entire Middle East can burn in a second,
*14:51.080- 14:55.040* :  so I would hope that they can make the smart responsible decision.
*14:55.040- 15:00.700* :  Local media said the government wanted to hurt Iran for the attack without causing all-out war.
*15:00.700- 15:06.720* :  They said ministers also wanted to act in coordination with the US. American officials have
*15:06.720- 15:11.780* :  already made clear the US would not take part in any military action against Iran.
*15:12.520- 15:15.940* :  Even though only two days have passed since the unprecedented Iranian attack,
*15:15.940- 15:21.200* :  there was still space for political disagreement. Israel's opposition leader, Yaya Lapid,
*15:21.460- 15:27.580* :  accused the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of presiding over a total loss of Israeli deterrence.
*15:28.120- 15:32.500* :  Mr Netanyahu later summoned some opposition leaders for a security briefing,
*15:32.500- 15:38.020* :  but Mr Lapid was not included. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Nasa Kanani,
*15:38.020- 15:43.280* :  sought to justify his country's attack on Israel. Tonight in Israel, ministers were still
*15:43.280- 15:49.540* :  considering their response to what Iran called its restraint. Well, the while, Western allies
*15:49.540- 15:56.520* :  urged the same on them. James Landel introduced them. The price of oil has fallen slightly after
*15:56.520- 16:01.820* :  Iran's attack on Israel. Rising tensions in the Middle East had caused prices to increase in
*16:01.820- 16:07.980* :  recent weeks, but they've dropped back again as the Olegit explains. For weeks, traders and
*16:07.980- 16:12.320* :  analysts have viewed the rising tensions between Israel and Iran with growing concern.
*16:13.260- 16:18.880* :  This has pushed up prices, with the cost of Brent Crude rising from $85 a barrel in mid-March,
*16:18.880- 16:24.660* :  to just over $92 on Friday. However, the limited impact of the attacks themselves,
*16:24.660- 16:28.880* :  coupled with the clear diplomatic pressure on Israel to avoid escalation,
*16:29.260- 16:34.440* :  appear to have given the market some reassurance. As a result, oil prices have fallen back
*16:34.440- 16:41.500* :  slightly, but remain high. The Olegit. Coral reefs don't just make for stunning pictures or
*16:41.500- 16:47.580* :  exciting scuba diving adventures, they play a vital role in sustaining underwater ecosystems,
*16:48.300- 16:53.140* :  but climate scientists have long warned that coral is under threat from warming ocean temperatures.
*16:54.100- 16:59.720* :  Now, after 10 consecutive months of record temperatures, the world has experienced its fourth
*16:59.720- 17:04.960* :  global mass coral bleaching event affecting more than half of the world's reefs.
*17:05.680- 17:09.940* :  Jennifer McWater is from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
*17:10.700- 17:17.960* :  Coral bleaching is when the water in the ocean gets too warm and the algae that lives in the
*17:17.960- 17:24.980* :  coral's tissue leaves the animal because it's too hot and it's stressed. And so the corals appear
*17:24.980- 17:31.280* :  bleached because they've lost that algae in their tissue. If the coral dies, then the animal is dead
*17:31.280- 17:38.120* :  and eventually we start losing function on the reef. This is a habitat for lots of different
*17:38.120- 17:43.480* :  organisms from invertebrates to fish. You're going to be losing that structure and that habitat
*17:43.480- 17:48.740* :  even more. Our climate reporter Georgina Renard told us more about what this all means.
*17:49.560- 17:53.660* :  It basically means that there's been all this heat growing in the ocean for the past year,
*17:54.120- 17:58.460* :  mostly driven by climate change because the oceans absorb much of the heating that we're
*17:58.460- 18:03.260* :  putting into the atmosphere, and a bit caused by our knee-near this natural climate fluctuation,
*18:03.260- 18:08.100* :  which also increases sea surface temperatures. And that's been going on and now we're seeing
*18:08.100- 18:13.600* :  the first evidence of just what that building heat in the oceans is doing to this coral. And that's
*18:13.640- 18:19.000* :  basically the impact of the past 10 months of recorded temperatures that we've been talking about
*18:19.000- 18:23.600* :  so much. Exactly. So we've been going on and on about these climate records being broken and now
*18:23.600- 18:28.200* :  we're really seeing the global evidence of those impacts. Coral is this amazing sort of very
*18:28.200- 18:33.980* :  sensitive ecosystem. It's beautiful and provides this vast structure in the oceans for creatures
*18:33.980- 18:40.200* :  to live on around 25% of marine life depends on these cities that the coral reefs build. But it's
*18:40.200- 18:45.900* :  very sensitive. So as soon as temperatures increase above their limit, the sort of maximum
*18:45.900- 18:51.480* :  limit, they really quickly feel that stress. And then they become sick and diseased. And if that
*18:51.480- 18:56.960* :  heat goes on for long enough, they do start to die. And this is across all oceans, the Atlantic,
*18:56.960- 19:02.420* :  the Indian, the Pacific. But most famously, we probably know the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.
*19:02.820- 19:07.420* :  And scientists there have been diving and doing aerial surveys and watching this bleaching.
*19:07.420- 19:13.960* :  And in some places around 20, 25% of the coral has actually already died. And this bleaching is
*19:14.040- 19:21.680* :  quite a slow process. So can it be stopped or even reversed? Absolutely. So it does take a long time
*19:21.680- 19:27.460* :  for the coral to die. And it can recover. It's a bit like a human if they get stressed, the body
*19:27.900- 19:32.660* :  responds in different ways. And if you have enough time to recover, you can. But the problem with
*19:32.660- 19:38.360* :  this coral is that a lot of it is experiencing multiple heat episodes and it doesn't have the
*19:38.360- 19:43.420* :  time to recover. And when we think of coral, we often think of very beautiful colors. But actually
*19:43.420- 19:49.180* :  the sound that coral makes is very important. Yes, absolutely. So we think of these fluorescent
*19:49.180- 19:53.980* :  colors that these huge reefs also produce lots of sound, creaking and singing.
*19:57.320- 20:01.920* :  And it's partly that which support all of this marine life. So one example is fish
*20:01.920- 20:06.860* :  use those sounds to to find their way home. It's a guide and they navigate using it.
*20:06.860- 20:12.900* :  They go home to breed and spawn the next generations. And then when the coral dies, obviously
*20:13.100- 20:17.500* :  they use that that navigation sign and some of these fish are unable to find their way home.
*20:18.460- 20:23.240* :  That was Georgina Ranard. And if you want to read more on this story, head to our science pages

*22:01.580- 22:06.020* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. A controversial bill being discussed in the
*22:06.020- 22:11.420* :  Georgian Parliament on Monday led to a rule erupting between opposing members in the chamber.
*22:12.280- 22:15.300* :  The incident was captured on the Parliament's live feed.
*22:17.680- 22:23.160* :  Mahmuka Medina Raza of the ruling green party was speaking from the dispatch box.
*22:27.120- 22:34.320* :  When he was struck by an opposition MP Aleko Elishashvili, this then provoked a wider fight with
*22:34.320- 22:40.660* :  other politicians getting involved before the feed was cut. The bill has been dubbed the Russian
*22:40.740- 22:45.900* :  law and would require organisations that accept funds from abroad to register as foreign agents
*22:45.900- 22:51.820* :  or face fines. Such is the opposition to it in Georgia that thousands of demonstrators protested
*22:51.820- 22:57.660* :  outside the Parliament. Our reporter Rehen Demutri was among them. To be honest, I have a sense of
*22:57.660- 23:05.820* :  deja vu because I was covering this same story last year. There were mass huge protests that was
*23:05.820- 23:12.480* :  the time when the Georgian government was the first attempt to pass this law and last year it was
*23:12.480- 23:20.440* :  called the foreign agents law. Last year the Georgian government was forced to back off and they
*23:20.440- 23:27.620* :  cancelled their plans to pass the law because of the mass protests and to a lot of people's
*23:27.620- 23:33.980* :  kind of astonishment earlier this month. They said, look, we're going to bring this law back. We're
*23:33.980- 23:40.340* :  just changing the title. Now it's called on the transparency of foreign funding but the content
*23:40.340- 23:47.920* :  of the law remains unchanged. Lastly, people were chanting no to the Russian law and it has been
*23:47.920- 23:54.900* :  the main slogan today as well. So many people are here because they believe that this law is
*23:57.240- 24:06.740* :  something that will take the country back to Russia's orbit. Numerous falls show that the vast
*24:06.740- 24:15.960* :  majority of Georgians over 80% see the country's future as part of the EU and therefore there's such
*24:15.960- 24:21.820* :  a large rally today. People are saying our future is with Europe and I can see so many people
*24:22.660- 24:29.940* :  wrapped in EU flags and Georgian flags and they're holding banners that read no to the Russian law.
*24:30.420- 24:35.240* :  And the protests are not just outside parliament, they're inside parliament too. Have we had that
*24:35.240- 24:43.720* :  scuffle? Yes, early today there was a scuffle when one opposition MP he punched the head of the
*24:43.720- 24:50.640* :  parliamentary faction, the Georgian dream government's faction. I actually saw this MP a short
*24:50.640- 24:57.980* :  while ago he has a bruise on his forehead and he said that he was beaten up and the interesting
*24:57.980- 25:03.940* :  thing is that so many people were trying to take selfies, young people were trying to take selfies
*25:03.940- 25:11.140* :  with him. I spoke to some of these people they were just young people 15 years old saying you know he
*25:11.140- 25:18.340* :  expressed something that we all feel that's why they're all very supportive even though it was
*25:18.340- 25:25.700* :  violence of course inside parliament. Do you think the governing party can push this bill through
*25:26.000- 25:33.260* :  given this level of opposition? I think we'll have to wait and see I it's very difficult to predict
*25:33.260- 25:40.500* :  but given the size of the crowd today and the mood among people that they're so determined
*25:41.340- 25:46.720* :  they're saying that they are fighting for their future and they really see it as a clear cut
*25:46.740- 25:53.500* :  you know either Georgia goes forward towards Europe or back to Russia.
*25:54.540- 25:59.960* :  Rayhan Dimitri, Croatians will be heading to the polls on Wednesday for parliamentary elections
*25:59.960- 26:05.400* :  and it's become a battle putting the Prime Minister against the president. Prime Minister Andrei
*26:05.400- 26:11.760* :  Plankovic is hoping to win a third term for the ruling right wing HDZ party but his longtime rival
*26:11.760- 26:17.360* :  president Zoran Milanovic has declared himself as a possible head of government if the center left
*26:17.360- 26:23.160* :  coalition wins. If nothing else the president's move has livened up what might otherwise have been
*26:23.160- 26:28.920* :  a predictable poll as our correspondent Gaita Lorny reports from Croatia's capital, Sargreb.
*26:31.180- 26:38.820* :  Rivers of justice. That's the rallying cry of Croatia's center left opposition parties ahead of
*26:38.820- 26:45.240* :  polling day. They accuse the governing HDZ party of corruption and cronism and they say that's
*26:45.240- 26:49.820* :  been driving tens of thousands of young Croatians to leave the country every year.
*26:50.120- 26:56.680* :  Sandra Benchich is the main candidate of the green left party Mojamo. People who are HDZ
*26:56.680- 27:03.840* :  actually get the jobs or promotions or better salaries. This hopelessness that it will not change
*27:03.980- 27:13.340* :  people across the border and most of them do not get back. When he announced the election date
*27:13.340- 27:18.440* :  president Zoran Milanovic declared that he would be the center left candidate for prime minister
*27:18.940- 27:24.420* :  that electrified the race due to his popularity but the constitutional court swiftly ruled that
*27:24.420- 27:30.140* :  the president was ineligible. In return Mr Milanovic accused the judges of doing the government
*27:30.140- 27:38.940* :  spitting that gangster because taking the court hostage such peasants are illiterate so it's a problem
*27:38.940- 27:44.780* :  because that means the decision is also illiterate. Despite the court ban on his candidacy the president
*27:44.780- 27:50.300* :  has been traveling around the country meeting supporters. Officially he's not been campaigning but
*27:50.300- 27:55.040* :  the seems little doubt that he'd resigned to take up the prime minister's post if the center left
*27:55.040- 28:03.980* :  one. The event we've got on here is basically promoting sport for young people but it's also
*28:03.980- 28:10.180* :  being co-opted by the governing party of Croatia the HDZ with prime minister Andrei Klankovich
*28:10.180- 28:18.480* :  due to making appearance. What is relevant that the croats are provided with the government and
*28:18.480- 28:24.040* :  with the parliamentary majority which will ensure stability over the next four years and create
*28:24.040- 28:28.760* :  conditions for economic growth and social division? Is it damaging for Croatia to have this sort
*28:28.760- 28:34.660* :  of competition between the president and the prime minister? Well it's bizarre but I'm trying to
*28:34.660- 28:45.160* :  sort of minimize the negative effects of this unconstitutional ex. The prime minister might not like
*28:45.160- 28:51.220* :  it but the candidate who isn't a candidate remains the one to watch and while he remains president
*28:51.220- 28:56.680* :  Zoran Melanovic will also have a major role to play in the formation of Croatia's next government
*28:56.680- 29:01.180* :  whichever way you look at it in this election he's very much taking center stage.
*29:04.340- 29:10.360* :  Gajdaloni reporting from the Croatian capital Zagreb. The weapons supervisor who loaded the gun
*29:10.360- 29:16.440* :  that killed a cinematographer on the set of the US film Rust has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.
*29:17.260- 29:21.760* :  Hannah Gutierrez read was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March.
*29:22.300- 29:27.200* :  The actor Alec Baldwin was holding the gun when it fired and killed Helena Hutchins during
*29:27.200- 29:32.620* :  rehearsals in New Mexico in 2021. Emma Vardy reports from Los Angeles.
*29:33.360- 29:38.800* :  Hannah Gutierrez read whose 26 was given the maximum sentence by the judge after her conviction.
*29:39.480- 29:44.740* :  During her trial she'd been called careless and reckless for having mixed up live rounds in a
*29:44.740- 29:50.240* :  box of the dummy rounds that were being used on set. In court she said she'd made a mistake but
*29:50.240- 29:56.580* :  was not a monster. The judge said she'd neither remorse nor regret. Alec Baldwin is due to face a trial
*29:56.580- 30:02.460* :  in July for the same charge. His defense will argue that it was Gutierrez reads responsibility to
*30:02.460- 30:08.240* :  ensure the gun was safe but if found guilty he too could be sentenced to jail. Emma Vardy.
*30:09.080- 30:13.820* :  The electric carmaker Tesla is to lay off more than 10% of his global workforce.
*30:13.820- 30:18.560* :  The company has begun to fill the impact of slowing global demand for EVs.
*30:19.020- 30:22.780* :  It's due to report it's quarterly earnings this month that has already announced a decline
*30:22.780- 30:27.840* :  in vehicle deliveries so far this year. Here's our technology reporter, Shionna McCullum.
*30:28.440- 30:33.120* :  The news of the job losses was circulated to staff on email with the firm's billionaire owner,
*30:33.120- 30:38.820* :  Elon Musk, saying he'd made the difficult decision to reduce the head count by more than 10%.
*30:39.120- 30:44.740* :  That works out at more than 14,000 employees. He said there was nothing he hated more than letting
*30:44.740- 30:50.200* :  people go but it had to be done to enable the company to be lean and innovative. Tesla's earnings
*30:50.200- 30:56.860* :  have been below market expectations as it faces increased competition and cheaper electric cars
*30:56.860- 31:01.740* :  mainly from China. It is not yet known where the cuts will take place across the business
*31:02.220- 31:06.020* :  but two well-known executives have confirmed that they will be departing.
*31:06.360- 31:12.380* :  Shionna McCullum. We've learned a lot about space and the universe in the last 100 or so years
*31:12.380- 31:18.040* :  but there's still so much we don't know. At the Royal Society in London this week, a meeting
*31:18.040- 31:23.380* :  for scientists has been taking place called challenging the standard cosmological model.
*31:24.140- 31:28.640* :  It looks at whether we've got a lot wrong in our thinking about how the universe works.
*31:29.600- 31:34.200* :  Evan Davis spoke to Professor Wendy Freeman from the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics
*31:34.200- 31:40.100* :  at the University of Chicago who was at the conference. The standard model is a model we've had
*31:40.100- 31:45.660* :  for about a quarter of a century now and it's a model that describes our expanding universe
*31:45.700- 31:51.680* :  began with a hot big bang and it describes the composition of the universe as being
*31:51.680- 31:59.060* :  made up of matter and energy and most of the matter in the universe turns out to be in a form
*31:59.060- 32:07.000* :  that's dark, it doesn't emit radiation and most of the energy density of the universe turns out
*32:07.000- 32:12.340* :  to be another we call dark energy, a dark form that's causing the universe to speed up
*32:12.500- 32:17.920* :  in its expansion. Right so that explains how it's speeding up that the energy is creating the
*32:17.920- 32:23.920* :  expansion. Right that's the standard model. What are the problems? What are the what are the
*32:23.920- 32:28.020* :  date points if you like that say hang on there's some issues with this model it doesn't quite
*32:28.020- 32:33.400* :  explain everything. Yeah there are a number of anomalies that have surfaced in recent years
*32:33.660- 32:40.160* :  and one of those is that when we measure the expansion rate of the universe at the current time
*32:40.160- 32:46.060* :  measure it locally it doesn't agree with the measurements that are coming from measurements of
*32:46.060- 32:52.100* :  the background radiation early in the universe and so we live in one universe those numbers ought
*32:52.100- 32:59.160* :  to line up and according to some studies they don't. So that's one anomaly that has surfaced
*32:59.200- 33:05.760* :  and there are others in the density fluctuations of matter compared to the fluctuations in
*33:05.760- 33:11.920* :  radiation and there are a number of others. So the group here is assembled to try and understand
*33:11.920- 33:17.300* :  are there anomalies that would break the current standard model or the things that were missing
*33:17.300- 33:23.860* :  new physics that we could learn about and so we're actively debating those kinds of issues. Right now
*33:23.860- 33:29.840* :  are you all there just picking at the current model at the model we describe or it's just a tweak
*33:29.900- 33:33.700* :  and looking at it and saying this doesn't work that doesn't work or is there an alternative view
*33:33.700- 33:39.300* :  an alternative model of what the universe is doing how it how it's structured. Yeah I think that's
*33:39.300- 33:43.840* :  one of the interesting issues right now there's not another model that has surfaced that can explain
*33:43.840- 33:49.660* :  all the anomalies and we know historically that these kinds of anomalies the significance of them
*33:50.220- 33:55.060* :  varies and some of them will strengthen with time as we get more and more data and some of them
*33:55.060- 33:59.700* :  will disappear and those are the kinds of things that we argue about. I think what's really
*33:59.700- 34:04.900* :  exciting for us is that there's a lot of new data that it's just coming into being now that we're
*34:05.140- 34:11.380* :  considering and the future for the next decade looks really promising in terms of the strength
*34:12.020- 34:17.760* :  of the surveys and the statistics that will come out of those new surveys but but I think also
*34:17.760- 34:22.920* :  what's interesting is that despite an awful lot of effort to try and find other models that might
*34:22.920- 34:29.280* :  better explain the universe that's been very difficult to do the standard model has proved very
*34:29.280- 34:34.820* :  difficult to supersede. Isn't it a donut? I saw the the alternative model is that it's a donut or
*34:35.520- 34:41.900* :  a kind of two horned back to back. It's a different shape and it's not really expanding. It's
*34:42.140- 34:46.740* :  the same size but bits are expanding and other bits are contracting. We just haven't spotted that.
*34:47.000- 34:52.080* :  It's very hard to come up with a model that will explain all of the data that we see at any one time
*34:52.140- 35:00.060* :  and so the standard model is curiously proved to be very robust which isn't to say that there won't
*35:00.060- 35:05.360* :  be some new data that will really show that there's a problem with the standard model and a new
*35:05.360- 35:10.360* :  theory that will explain that but it hasn't emerged yet. Professor Wendy Freeman
*35:13.140- 35:17.320* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
