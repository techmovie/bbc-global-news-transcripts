*01:26.500- 01:33.420* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 23rd of April, these are our
*01:33.420- 01:34.120* :  main stories.
*01:34.640- 01:39.980* :  US prosecutors have accused Donald Trump of a conspiracy over hush money paid to a porn
*01:39.980- 01:43.100* :  actress at the start of his criminal trial in New York.
*01:43.580- 01:48.040* :  Police in Ecuador have caught the leader of a powerful criminal gang at the heart of
*01:48.040- 01:50.860* :  a wave of violence that destabilized the country.
*01:51.420- 01:57.440* :  And a UN report into the Palestinian refugee agency UNRA has concluded it must do more to
*01:57.440- 01:59.800* :  improve its neutrality and transparency.
*02:02.300- 02:07.860* :  Also in this podcast, the search for five raccoons who've been on the run from a zoo in
*02:07.860- 02:09.560* :  the Netherlands for more than a month.
*02:09.840- 02:14.940* :  They saw like deer and otters and a beaver and they really had good nights seeing all
*02:14.940- 02:16.820* :  those animals with no raccoons.
*02:20.420- 02:26.180* :  New York is hosting one of the most high profile trials in United States history, the first
*02:26.180- 02:28.660* :  criminal trial of a former US president.
*02:29.280- 02:34.620* :  Day one of the trial proper ended on Monday in Manhattan, where Donald Trump stands
*02:34.620- 02:38.300* :  accused of 34 counts of falsifying business records.
*02:38.840- 02:45.280* :  They relate to a $130,000 payment made to the porn actress Stormy Daniels to silence
*02:45.280- 02:49.760* :  her about her allegation that she and Mr. Trump had a sexual encounter.
*02:50.560- 02:54.980* :  It isn't the payment itself that said to be illegal, but the way it was described in Mr.
*02:54.980- 02:55.860* :  Trump's accounts.
*02:56.440- 03:02.520* :  As he arrived at court, Mr. Trump made a series of evidence-free and in some cases factually
*03:02.520- 03:03.700* :  wrong assertions.
*03:04.140- 03:07.360* :  I just want to say before we begin these are all biting trials.
*03:07.940- 03:09.960* :  This is done as election interference.
*03:10.220- 03:11.140* :  Everybody knows it.
*03:11.500- 03:17.720* :  I'm here instead of being able to be in Pennsylvania and Georgia and lots of other places campaigning
*03:18.340- 03:19.440* :  and it's very unfair.
*03:19.440- 03:21.320* :  Fortunately, the poll numbers are very good.
*03:21.320- 03:24.560* :  They've been going up because people understand what's going on.
*03:24.580- 03:28.060* :  This is a witch hunt and it's a shame and it comes out of Washington.
*03:28.060- 03:32.560* :  It's in coordination with Washington and everything, including the DA's office.
*03:32.560- 03:34.420* :  It's in coordination with Washington.
*03:35.060- 03:40.800* :  I just want people to understand that this is done for purposes of hurting the opponent
*03:41.480- 03:44.080* :  of the worst president in the history of our country.
*03:44.500- 03:46.680* :  What's going on right here should never be happening.
*03:46.680- 03:48.680* :  It's a very, very sad day in America.
*03:48.680- 03:49.560* :  I could tell you that.
*03:50.040- 03:54.900* :  The seven men and five women of the jury heard the prosecution and the defense outline
*03:54.900- 03:55.680* :  their cases.
*03:56.420- 04:01.840* :  Prosecutors spoke about a catch and kill policy allegedly orchestrated by the former president.
*04:02.320- 04:03.800* :  So what's the significance of that?
*04:03.800- 04:07.160* :  A question for our correspondent, Nettaw Feeck, in New York.
*04:07.740- 04:14.320* :  Catch and kill means essentially to buy stories but not to publish them, to kill them so
*04:14.320- 04:16.520* :  they don't reach the voting public.
*04:16.680- 04:23.060* :  And this is really central to the prosecution's case because essentially what they say is
*04:23.060- 04:27.020* :  there was a criminal conspiracy and then there was a cover-up.
*04:27.060- 04:31.800* :  The criminal conspiracy they say was to try to influence the 2016 election.
*04:32.360- 04:37.160* :  And they say this catch and kill scheme was so important because after that infamous
*04:37.160- 04:41.660* :  access Hollywood tape where Donald Trump was heard bragging about grabbing women's
*04:41.660- 04:46.360* :  generals because he was famous, when that came out his campaign was in panic mode.
*04:46.780- 04:54.480* :  And therefore, buying Stormy Daniels' story to again catch and kill it was a way to shield
*04:54.560- 05:00.360* :  him from any negative impact that could have on him further with female voters in particular.
*05:00.940- 05:06.380* :  And that's why prosecutors started with bringing the first witness who was the owner of the
*05:06.380- 05:10.780* :  National Inquirer, which is a tabloid newspaper that kind of helped in that scheme.
*05:10.980- 05:13.280* :  His name is David Pecker, isn't it?
*05:13.320- 05:15.020* :  Tell us a little bit more about him.
*05:15.140- 05:18.300* :  David Pecker is the owner of American Media Group.
*05:18.460- 05:25.060* :  He owned several different tabloids and he just started on the witness stand just getting
*05:25.060- 05:27.580* :  some biographical information about himself.
*05:27.580- 05:34.360* :  But prosecutors said that he will testify that he spoke directly with Donald Trump about
*05:34.360- 05:41.040* :  this scheme and getting reimbursed for a payment he made to a former Playboy model, Karen
*05:41.040- 05:46.300* :  McDougal, who also alleges she had an affair with Donald Trump, which he denies, and also
*05:46.300- 05:50.820* :  a door man who was also trying to sell a story about Donald Trump, which turned out to
*05:50.820- 05:51.380* :  be false.
*05:52.060- 05:54.260* :  But essentially, they are going through.
*05:54.420- 05:59.460* :  He talks about how usually they would pay $10,000 for a tabloid story.
*05:59.780- 06:07.120* :  But here, he paid more than $150,000 to Karen McDougal, again, in coordination allegedly
*06:07.140- 06:11.580* :  with Donald Trump's campaign to kind of get rid of that negative story.
*06:11.580- 06:18.160* :  So he, for prosecutors, is a key kind of cooperating witness and he is just meant to add strength
*06:18.160- 06:23.240* :  to their case along with Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former lawyer, and some of the business
*06:23.240- 06:25.380* :  records that they are going to be presenting as evidence.
*06:25.800- 06:27.760* :  And what are the defense arguments, Netta?
*06:28.100- 06:33.940* :  Well, the defense, keep in mind, they are just there to really so doubt in jurors' minds
*06:33.940- 06:37.640* :  because the burden of proof is on the prosecution in this case.
*06:38.240- 06:41.840* :  So Todd Blanche, Donald Trump's lawyer, first argued that there's
*06:41.840- 06:44.520* :  nothing wrong with trying to influence an election.
*06:44.580- 06:46.220* :  It's called democracy, he said.
*06:46.760- 06:51.200* :  He also said that Donald Trump was so high up in the organization that he had nothing to
*06:51.200- 06:54.820* :  do with how these payments were recorded in corporate records.
*06:55.200- 06:59.500* :  I think it's important for listeners to remember that Donald Trump has acknowledged
*06:59.500- 07:05.000* :  reimbursing Michael Cohen, but he really denies kind of directing this scheme at all.
*07:05.000- 07:09.460* :  He says it was more about saving his family from personal embarrassment.
*07:10.020- 07:15.260* :  So his lawyers have really been trying to so doubt in every point of the prosecutor's
*07:15.260- 07:16.000* :  arguments here.
*07:16.480- 07:18.040* :  Netta Feek in New York.
*07:18.800- 07:22.280* :  Police in Ecuador have captured one of the country's most wanted people.
*07:22.280- 07:28.000* :  Fabrizio Col√≥n Pico is the leader of a powerful criminal gang known as Los Lobos.
*07:28.540- 07:33.880* :  It's estimated 8,000 members are set to have played a major role in destabilizing Ecuador.
*07:34.480- 07:39.780* :  The arrest comes a day after a referendum on increasing police power to tackle violent
*07:39.900- 07:40.420* :  crime.
*07:40.420- 07:44.300* :  Monica Palencia is the Ecuadorian interior minister.
*07:47.600- 07:52.780* :  Some time ago we broke the unfortunate news of Col√≥n Pico's escape from Cotopaxi prison,
*07:53.520- 07:55.360* :  and today we have recaptured him.
*07:56.180- 08:01.640* :  We all know who Col√≥n Pico is, he's a symbol, and the national police have never ceased
*08:01.640- 08:02.680* :  searching for him.
*08:03.520- 08:09.380* :  Our South America correspondent Ioni Wells, speaking from a busy place in Quito, told us
*08:09.380- 08:13.540* :  more about Fabrizio Col√≥n Pico and his original escape from prison.
*08:13.960- 08:19.400* :  He was one of more than 30 prisoners that escaped from Rio Bamba prison on the 8th of January,
*08:19.400- 08:24.380* :  and this was part of a kind of wave of prison riots, violent attacks, which took place
*08:24.420- 08:26.420* :  in prisons at the start of this year.
*08:26.840- 08:31.480* :  The prisoners have said that he had basically taken advantage of chaos that had been created
*08:31.480- 08:36.160* :  by rioting that was going on within the prisons to essentially just walk out of jail at
*08:36.160- 08:36.580* :  the time.
*08:36.780- 08:41.980* :  The legacy of the inmates who had escaped were quickly re-arrested, but he was one who
*08:41.980- 08:46.800* :  managed to basically avoid being found for months and months and months, so he has been
*08:46.800- 08:50.180* :  on the run since January, essentially, and has been one of the most wanted people in
*08:50.180- 08:50.760* :  the whole country.
*08:51.000- 08:52.340* :  So tell us about the recapture.
*08:53.000- 08:57.400* :  Police haven't given a huge amount of information at the moment, but they say that they have found
*08:59.000- 08:59.020* :  him.
*08:59.020- 09:01.740* :  He had died his hair as part of a disguise to try and stop himself being found, but they
*09:01.740- 09:07.280* :  have now recaptured him, and I think the sort of hope is that this will be seen as quite
*09:07.280- 09:12.340* :  a big win for the security services in Ecuador, although certainly one concern I think that
*09:12.340- 09:16.980* :  there will be is that in the past, when the high up gang members have been arrested or
*09:16.980- 09:21.120* :  have faced punishments from the authorities, that has sometimes led to further outbreaks
*09:21.120- 09:23.160* :  of violence or rioting in itself.
*09:23.460- 09:26.940* :  Tell us a little bit more about the gang, Los Lobos.
*09:27.280- 09:31.740* :  Well, Los Lobos is one of the most powerful, influential criminal gangs in Ecuador.
*09:31.800- 09:34.320* :  It has about 8,000 members.
*09:34.320- 09:38.960* :  It's thought to have a lot of links to a powerful gang in Mexico as well, one of the biggest drug
*09:39.000- 09:39.760* :  cartels there.
*09:40.280- 09:45.500* :  Ecuador, in general, has seen its homicide rate, its sort of rate of kidnappings and other
*09:45.500- 09:49.260* :  violent crimes increase significantly in the last couple of years, and that has partly
*09:49.260- 09:54.980* :  been attributed to criminal gangs like Los Lobos, who have unleashed really spates of
*09:55.120- 09:55.800* :  violent attacks.
*09:56.380- 10:01.180* :  Particularly in big cities, but also in port cities like Guayaquil and Ecuador, which
*10:01.180- 10:02.120* :  is one of the major ports.
*10:02.120- 10:07.280* :  It's where a lot of goods like bananas get shipped to the US and to Europe, and that makes
*10:07.320- 10:12.360* :  it a really sort of right area for drug cartels to move in because they can stash drugs in
*10:12.360- 10:13.760* :  a lot of those instational shipments.
*10:13.980- 10:19.000* :  How big a blow to Los Lobos will for Bricio Col√≥n, Pico's arrest be?
*10:19.560- 10:21.060* :  I think it will be a big blow.
*10:21.060- 10:26.680* :  The leader is one of the most powerful members, and his gang has wielded huge amounts of influence
*10:26.680- 10:28.220* :  in the country in the last couple of years.
*10:28.740- 10:33.100* :  His gang has been accused of planning some of the most high-profile murders, including
*10:33.100- 10:37.340* :  the murder last year of one of the presidential candidates, Fernando Aviva Centio.
*10:37.800- 10:41.920* :  So I think the loss of its leader will be a blow to the gang, however, the sheer amount
*10:41.920- 10:46.640* :  of members that it has means they are still strong in the country, they still wield a
*10:46.640- 10:47.220* :  lot of power.
*10:47.260- 10:51.300* :  So there are questions really about whether the rest of just one member, one significant
*10:51.300- 10:55.900* :  leader like this, will really be enough to dent the power of a criminal gang like that.
*10:56.540- 10:57.220* :  Iony Wells.
*10:58.220- 11:03.380* :  Earlier this year, an Israeli intelligence reporter leds that some staff of Onra, the UN
*11:03.380- 11:08.380* :  agency providing aid to Palestinians, have been involved in the October 7th attacks on
*11:08.380- 11:09.640* :  Israel by Hamas.
*11:10.100- 11:13.920* :  The US and several other countries cut payments to the agency in response.
*11:14.900- 11:20.460* :  Now an independent review into Onra's neutrality has said it has robust frameworks in place,
*11:21.160- 11:24.720* :  but still has worked to do to improve its vetting and transparency.
*11:24.980- 11:29.860* :  The report's author is a former foreign minister of France, Catrine Colonna.
*11:30.520- 11:36.100* :  Coming to our recommendations, some, and these are just a few examples, include regularly
*11:36.980- 11:44.400* :  sharing the list of employees, digitalized with some details of the employees, with host
*11:44.400- 11:45.580* :  countries and with Israel.
*11:46.020- 11:51.880* :  It works well in some countries, less with Israel in the past years.
*11:51.880- 11:57.480* :  It could have been better, but in the very recent times, this is affected, of course, by
*11:57.480- 11:59.200* :  the global atmosphere.
*11:59.800- 12:03.240* :  The BBC's Geneva correspondent Imogen Fox has seen the report.
*12:03.980- 12:08.000* :  It is not a glowing endorsement of Onra.
*12:08.000- 12:16.720* :  It says that despite it having very rigorous operating procedures in place, it should do
*12:16.720- 12:24.360* :  more in vetting of staff and in upholding those key humanitarian principles of impartiality
*12:24.540- 12:25.560* :  and neutrality.
*12:25.880- 12:30.500* :  What it says, though, is that Onra itself tries very hard to do this, but it needs more support
*12:30.540- 12:36.120* :  from donor countries and from the bodies that it has to work with, and that includes
*12:36.120- 12:40.100* :  Israel and the Israeli military and the Palestinian Authority.
*12:40.860- 12:42.620* :  And what does it say about Israel?
*12:43.660- 12:50.100* :  Well, there's a key finding here which will not please Israel, and that is we know that
*12:50.100- 12:56.480* :  Israel alleges in addition to specific allegations that 12 onra staff participate in the October
*12:56.480- 13:00.480* :  7th tax, and that is the subject, I have to say, of a separate investigation.
*13:00.660- 13:07.900* :  Israel has alleged that thousands of Onra staff members are also members of Hamas or are
*13:07.900- 13:14.680* :  supportive of it or are involved in it, and this report says that Israel has yet to provide
*13:14.680- 13:18.980* :  any supportive evidence for those claims.
*13:19.100- 13:26.400* :  We had Israel's reaction to that, which says, this UN report is a cosmetic exercise and
*13:26.400- 13:29.100* :  it hasn't looked at the really deep-rooted problems.
*13:29.560- 13:35.080* :  Now multiple countries pulled their funding of Onra after the allegations were made.
*13:36.140- 13:39.620* :  What sort of impact did that have on the organisation's work?
*13:40.180- 13:47.120* :  It has made the agency even more cash strapped than it was already.
*13:47.120- 13:51.900* :  I mean, I think we have to be realistic, all UN agencies, aid agencies were cash strapped
*13:51.900- 13:58.680* :  at the moment because of the number of crises we have, but it is now operating on a shoestring
*13:58.680- 14:00.180* :  and a shoestring that's very short.
*14:00.880- 14:06.720* :  So Onra does need, if it is to continue doing what it does, running hospitals, running
*14:06.720- 14:13.040* :  schools, supplying humanitarian aid, it needs that funding back, particularly from the
*14:13.100- 14:15.360* :  United States and the United Kingdom.
*14:15.980- 14:23.900* :  Now the UN has been hoping that the depth of this report, the fact that the UN itself
*14:23.980- 14:31.320* :  has accepted all the recommendations and will implement them, including more transparency,
*14:32.200- 14:38.560* :  stronger vetting, more emphasis on neutrality, that this will encourage donors to restore
*14:38.560- 14:39.340* :  that funding.
*14:39.840- 14:41.160* :  That was image in folks.
*14:41.660- 14:46.260* :  As we heard in the earlier podcast, a senior Israeli figure has resigned in the wake of
*14:46.260- 14:47.840* :  the October 7th attacks.
*14:48.260- 14:53.380* :  Major General Aharon Haliva was the chief of the military intelligence service.
*14:53.600- 14:57.220* :  The IDF said he'd formally set down as soon as his successor was chosen.
*14:57.920- 15:02.960* :  Amir Avivy is a Brigadier general in the Israeli reserves and a former deputy commander
*15:02.960- 15:04.180* :  of the Gaza division.
*15:04.260- 15:08.680* :  He is the founder and chairman of the Israel Defence and Security Forum.
*15:09.300- 15:14.520* :  Rebecca Kersby asked him if he was surprised by the timing of General Haliva's resignation.
*15:15.380- 15:18.620* :  Well, I think that there is an explanation regarding the timing.
*15:19.060- 15:27.880* :  There is the alleged attack of Israel in Syria, Iran in general was killed and the assessment
*15:27.880- 15:35.060* :  of the same Haliba and his organization was that Iran is not going to retaliate.
*15:35.700- 15:42.480* :  Because they got this also wrong and at this stage in Israel, there were many articles
*15:42.480- 15:47.400* :  by many prominent people in Israel saying, okay, that's it.
*15:47.920- 15:53.880* :  Let's look at what happened on the specifically the 7th of October, because there were so many
*15:53.880- 15:59.960* :  warnings ahead of this happening that have come to light the BBC spoke to observers, I
*15:59.960- 16:04.860* :  think they're called in the IDF, who had been warning for months that the Hamas was planning
*16:04.860- 16:05.540* :  something.
*16:05.620- 16:08.880* :  But it wasn't just the security failings on the day.
*16:08.880- 16:14.540* :  It was also failure in the response of what happened on the day that shocked so many Israelis.
*16:14.540- 16:15.860* :  What did go wrong?
*16:16.280- 16:16.900* :  Just reminders.
*16:17.620- 16:23.100* :  Well, I can tell you that Morganization presented two years ago a national security assessment
*16:23.140- 16:27.280* :  to the government and the army saying what is imminent and it will happen in the coming
*16:27.280- 16:27.780* :  two years.
*16:28.140- 16:29.240* :  We saw this coming.
*16:29.900- 16:35.660* :  For us, it was crystal clear, cannot understand how, with all the intelligence and everything
*16:35.660- 16:42.940* :  that Haliba and the whole intelligence apparatus of the army had, they couldn't see it coming.
*16:43.640- 16:49.540* :  I think there was a lot of information, but when you have a certain worldview, you process
*16:49.540- 16:54.640* :  this information in a way that you could simply disregard everything that is said and this
*16:54.640- 16:55.260* :  is what happened.
*16:55.420- 16:56.920* :  Well, I mean, is that an exception?
*16:56.940- 16:57.120* :  Is that an exception?
*16:57.180- 16:58.580* :  Not only the observers.
*16:58.900- 17:00.040* :  Is that an excuse, though?
*17:00.040- 17:04.280* :  I mean, given the very serious nature of defending, is it?
*17:04.280- 17:04.720* :  Not at all.
*17:04.800- 17:11.840* :  I think it's a huge failure, probably the bigger one is as I've ever had, and the amount
*17:11.840- 17:19.680* :  of soldiers and the level of readiness you had along the border was connected to the intelligence
*17:19.680- 17:24.820* :  and because there was no warning at all, nobody expected anything.
*17:26.320- 17:32.960* :  There were a certain amount of troops in the border and the attack, today we know between
*17:32.960- 17:37.880* :  4,000 to 5,000 terrorists that attacked in 70 different places.
*17:38.860- 17:42.780* :  And what about the response, though, because we heard from people who said that they were
*17:42.780- 17:48.160* :  waiting for the IDF or even the police to turn up and it took them a long time to get
*17:48.220- 17:50.620* :  to various of these places that were attacked.
*17:50.620- 17:58.180* :  So I think that the soldiers that were along the border fought firstly, they were outnumbered
*17:58.180- 18:04.120* :  almost in every place, terrorists arrived with huge amounts of weapons, all of them
*18:04.120- 18:06.620* :  by the way smuggled through the border with Egypt.
*18:07.780- 18:13.260* :  And the police came pretty fast and stopped the terrorists from moving towards major cities
*18:13.260- 18:20.780* :  like Ashkelon, but there were so many different areas where there was fighting and there was
*18:20.780- 18:27.140* :  only one road connecting all the towns, the terrorists seized the road and it was very
*18:27.180- 18:28.060* :  hard to reach.
*18:29.240- 18:35.120* :  Amir Avivy, a brigadier general in the Israeli reserves and a former deputy commander of
*18:35.120- 18:35.980* :  the Gaza division.
*18:36.900- 18:43.020* :  Next to Northern Ireland, which is betting big on film TV and gaming, the TV series Game
*18:43.020- 18:48.420* :  of Thrones was filmed there and building on that huge success, Northern Ireland is investing
*18:48.420- 18:53.380* :  millions of dollars in high tech production, indeed some of Hollywood's biggest stars
*18:53.380- 18:57.340* :  have been lured from the beaches of Malibu to the Antrim coast.
*18:57.840- 18:59.500* :  Hannah McCarthy has been for a visit.
*19:01.620- 19:06.400* :  Game of Thrones injected tens of millions of dollars into the region's economy, which has
*19:06.400- 19:11.940* :  struggled to provide high-skilled job opportunities for young people after decades of political conflict.
*19:12.700- 19:17.500* :  Film director turned technology entrepreneur Hugh McGory used to teach film at Queen's
*19:17.500- 19:18.920* :  University in Belfast.
*19:19.240- 19:25.180* :  A lot of the students that I was working with ended up getting world-class experience
*19:25.180- 19:28.260* :  by working at high levels on Game of Thrones.
*19:29.340- 19:34.340* :  Much of the HBO series was shot at a studio in the Docklands of Belfast where the towering
*19:34.340- 19:38.280* :  yellow cranes of the old shipbuilders Harland and will still pierce the skyline.
*19:38.960- 19:43.020* :  McGory's as Game of Thrones has had a hugely positive impact on the region.
*19:43.480- 19:50.140* :  It's community, but also the impact on tourism and general self-esteem.
*19:50.140- 19:54.540* :  You have to remember that we're coming out of a long period of conflict.
*19:55.300- 20:00.260* :  McGory says the world of TV and film production is innovating and moving away from traditional
*20:00.260- 20:02.220* :  film sets and on-site locations.
*20:02.920- 20:05.640* :  What's coming is artificial intelligence.
*20:06.340- 20:07.960* :  This isn't an incremental shift.
*20:07.960- 20:10.420* :  This is a totally radical shift.
*20:11.120- 20:15.500* :  More than Ireland has eager to be at the forefront of this AI revolution and is developing
*20:15.500- 20:19.120* :  a studio equipped for world-class TV, film and gaming production.
*20:19.580- 20:23.920* :  We are building out one of the, if not the most advanced, currently, virtual production
*20:23.920- 20:24.880* :  studio complexes.
*20:24.880- 20:26.520* :  Have you been built anywhere in the world right now?
*20:27.220- 20:32.520* :  At a cost of nearly $100 million, Studio Ulster will open later this year in the Belfast
*20:32.520- 20:33.040* :  Docs.
*20:33.420- 20:38.460* :  CEO Declan Keeney says it will have pioneering stages encased in walls of high-definition
*20:38.500- 20:39.080* :  screens.
*20:39.460- 20:43.760* :  We can create real light from these walls and we can film what we call in-camera visual
*20:43.760- 20:44.100* :  effects.
*20:44.760- 20:47.140* :  He says it will transform the way movies are shot.
*20:47.640- 20:53.240* :  So for example, in Belfast, we could create Morocco by bringing in sand and creating, you
*20:53.240- 20:56.340* :  know, in the round, projecting the horizon in a Morocco.
*20:56.740- 20:58.960* :  And so, you know, it transforms what's possible.
*20:59.400- 21:04.040* :  Keeney believes that the economic power of film, TV and gaming is not fully recognized.
*21:04.260- 21:09.420* :  Even though government figures show that the creative industries are worth around $135
*21:09.420- 21:11.140* :  billion to the UK.
*21:11.700- 21:18.560* :  Creative industries contribute more per year to the economy in the UK and Northern Ireland
*21:18.560- 21:23.080* :  than if you combined aerospace and life sciences and the automotive sectors.
*21:23.860- 21:28.760* :  Most importantly, the Studio Ulster CEO says that the creative sector could stem the
*21:28.760- 21:33.100* :  brain drain from Northern Ireland, offering young people a chance to stay and work here.
*21:33.620- 21:38.120* :  We are creating an environment where you can work on anything from very small scale projects,
*21:38.120- 21:43.280* :  build your portfolio, your scale sets and your capability all the way up to triple-lay
*21:43.280- 21:43.680* :  productions.
*21:44.180- 21:48.420* :  Northern Ireland is hoping, as well as creating more jobs, that the high-tech investment
*21:48.420- 21:52.480* :  will put it at the cutting edge of virtual and digital screen production in the future.
*22:01.080- 22:07.160* :  The flooding here is quite serious. Everything above the ground floor and above were flooded.
*22:07.760- 22:12.280* :  In Guangdong, in China, the impact of days of heavy rain and storms.

*22:32.680- 22:34.600* :  For me, that wasn't an option.
*22:34.960- 22:39.020* :  I've never really was a Salad guy, that's just not who I am, but new work for me.

*23:10.120- 23:11.660* :  This is the Global News Podcast.
*23:12.680- 23:18.040* :  For years, groups linked to Islamic State and Al-Qaeda have been carrying out regular attacks
*23:18.040- 23:20.900* :  in Africa targeting civilians and the military.
*23:21.520- 23:23.140* :  Thousands of people have been killed.
*23:23.720- 23:27.900* :  In West Africa, alone, millions of people have been displaced by the violence.
*23:28.780- 23:35.260* :  Against this backdrop, Nigeria is hosting a summit aimed at improving the continent's response to the insecurity.
*23:35.260- 23:38.540* :  Our Africa Regional Editor is Will Ross.
*23:38.900- 23:42.100* :  Nigerian National Security Advisor called the summit.
*23:42.100- 23:48.180* :  In order to basically put across a response that would be coming from right across the continent
*23:48.180- 23:56.180* :  a more joined-up response to the large number of problems there are in security problems ranging from,
*23:56.180- 24:04.160* :  of course, the Sahel, where there are these terrible daily attacks by these groups linked to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.
*24:04.160- 24:07.480* :  But right across the continent, Somalia, of course, Al-Shabab.
*24:07.480- 24:13.060* :  We hear a lot about down in Mozambique, the rise of a jihadist group there in the north of that country.
*24:13.820- 24:19.120* :  There are basically different officials coming from countries across the continent,
*24:19.120- 24:28.060* :  government officials, senior UN officials, interestingly nobody from Marley, Niger, or Burkina Faso.
*24:28.200- 24:31.700* :  And those three countries, of course, have seen coups in recent years.
*24:32.420- 24:39.480* :  And the coup leaders have said the reason we're taking power is because of the failure to tackle these jihadist problems.
*24:40.300- 24:50.840* :  And there are thousands of international troops working in Africa at the moment as well trying to help deal with attacks by groups like the ones that you mentioned.
*24:51.520- 24:55.400* :  But this event, this summit, is about finding African-led solutions, isn't it?
*24:55.440- 25:01.780* :  Certainly some of the comments during the summit so far have stressed the need for an Africa's solution.
*25:01.780- 25:06.420* :  I think there has been a feeling amongst some, especially West African countries,
*25:06.420- 25:10.480* :  that France kind of came in and led the international response.
*25:10.480- 25:14.140* :  The United States has obviously played a big role as well.
*25:14.140- 25:20.640* :  And I think some of the countries really want to be able to chart their own course and come up with their own solutions.
*25:20.780- 25:26.720* :  But of course, then you're into a big problem of funding, because the Nigerian president, for example,
*25:26.760- 25:32.720* :  Bola Tnubu is talking once again about the need for setting up a regional stand by force.
*25:32.720- 25:37.720* :  So a big military force that can be prepared to go in wherever there's a problem.
*25:37.720- 25:39.740* :  But I mean, that's going to cost a vast amount of money.
*25:39.740- 25:44.120* :  We've already had other regional forces that have had limited success.
*25:45.000- 25:47.420* :  They often require international funding.
*25:48.140- 25:55.380* :  So it's hard to know where the solution to all this is that the fact is these armed groups move across the continent
*25:55.380- 26:00.040* :  or move certainly across regions very fast to totally ignoring national borders.
*26:01.040- 26:04.720* :  Often moving around on motorbikes in cars, they're far quicker.
*26:04.720- 26:07.220* :  They know the terrain better than the militaries.
*26:07.740- 26:12.680* :  And the militaries in these different countries simply haven't been able to protect communities from the attack.
*26:12.680- 26:16.940* :  So quite what the continent can get out of a two-day summit, I've no idea.
*26:17.740- 26:23.140* :  But there is a need for a radical rethink about how they're going about improving the security.
*26:23.140- 26:26.340* :  And in the last couple of years, you know, we've seen these coups.
*26:26.340- 26:31.400* :  We've seen thousands of UN troops, peacekeeping troops, forced to leave Marley.
*26:31.400- 26:34.680* :  We've seen all these thousands of French troops force to leave.
*26:34.680- 26:37.800* :  But what is the solution in place of all these international troops?
*26:38.640- 26:39.020* :  Will Ross.
*26:39.840- 26:45.440* :  Next to China, at least 11 people are missing and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes
*26:45.440- 26:49.800* :  as to rental downpours continue to battle parts of southern China.
*26:50.420- 26:54.960* :  Days of heavy rain and storms in Guangdong province have led to severe flooding.
*26:55.620- 26:59.660* :  Several major rivers have reached their highest levels for half a century.
*27:00.360- 27:07.660* :  Landslides have hit several villages blocking roads, where the forecasters in Guangdong are calling the situation very grim.
*27:12.600- 27:16.200* :  Like in India and Yangshan, the flooding here is quite serious.
*27:16.840- 27:19.160* :  Everything above the ground floor and above were flooded.
*27:19.860- 27:21.460* :  But measures were taken well in advance.
*27:22.200- 27:24.260* :  Many of the residents had already moved away.
*27:24.340- 27:30.500* :  In the last two years, the rain has started to get relatively heavy.
*27:31.020- 27:35.360* :  In the past, the flood water rarely rose to this point, at least they were drained.
*27:40.360- 27:46.700* :  Isabel Hilton is the founder of China Dialogue, a group that examines China's environmental challenges.
*27:47.380- 27:51.180* :  Rebecca Kessby asked how unusual the current flooding in Guangdong was.
*27:51.780- 27:53.620* :  This is unusual in two respects.
*27:54.180- 27:57.700* :  As you're absolutely right, there is an annual flood season in fact in South China.
*27:58.240- 28:04.160* :  And it's quite often, the air is quite often hit by typhoons and, you know, other tropical storms.
*28:04.880- 28:11.420* :  But this is two months earlier than the usual flood season, and it's much, much heavier.
*28:12.020- 28:19.900* :  So it's a change in pattern, which of course has big effects on things like agriculture and actually on preparedness.
*28:20.780- 28:25.720* :  Well, and this part of China is often known as the world's factory, isn't it?
*28:25.960- 28:30.380* :  It's got these huge vast industry areas.
*28:30.380- 28:37.620* :  The population is enormous. There's a very high migrant worker constituent there as well.
*28:37.620- 28:41.580* :  Just talk us through what kind of place Guangdong is in this area.
*28:42.260- 28:48.680* :  Well, Guangdong province is, as you say, it was one of the very early free zones.
*28:48.860- 28:53.720* :  So when Deng Xiaoping decided to open China up, he opened in the South first.
*28:54.160- 28:57.260* :  It made sense because it's just over the border from Hong Kong.
*28:57.260- 29:03.020* :  A lot of investment came in, a lot of Hong Kong's manufacturing moved to the province.
*29:03.320- 29:05.060* :  And it just grew and grew and grew.
*29:05.220- 29:09.340* :  And of course, since those early days where you were at very low added value factories,
*29:09.340- 29:12.040* :  it's moved up the value chain considerably.
*29:12.680- 29:17.240* :  So now China wants to make it into the kind of Silicon Valley of China.
*29:17.240- 29:22.880* :  So the pearl of a delta development is earmarked for much higher end manufacturing.
*29:22.880- 29:26.640* :  It already has some BYD cars, for example, made in the province.
*29:27.180- 29:30.060* :  So it's very, very important to China economically.
*29:30.480- 29:33.200* :  And as you say, it's very, very densely populated.
*29:33.780- 29:38.080* :  And we know that the Chinese authorities have said they've been successful
*29:38.140- 29:42.480* :  in terms of evacuating people that are most at risk.
*29:42.820- 29:46.980* :  But is this something they're going to have to think about long term in terms of climate change
*29:46.980- 29:49.900* :  and what could happen another time if there's more flooding?
*29:50.520- 29:55.540* :  Well, they are. And of course, it's not just this problem that we're looking at at the moment.
*29:55.800- 30:02.920* :  But last year, the floods particularly hit the north-west, the northeast, and the capital bleaching.
*30:03.740- 30:09.340* :  And what the party tends to do when there are catastrophic events like this,
*30:09.360- 30:14.060* :  and they're not infrequent in China, they're getting more severe and they're getting harder to manage.
*30:14.580- 30:20.680* :  What the party tends to stress is not the lack of preparedness, because that would be politically difficult.
*30:20.880- 30:23.800* :  But it does stress the rescue that gets mounted.
*30:23.800- 30:26.820* :  So they send in the people's liberation army characteristically,
*30:27.320- 30:30.420* :  and they have lots of pictures on television and people being rescued.
*30:31.000- 30:34.880* :  Now, sometimes this plays well, and sometimes it plays less well.
*30:34.880- 30:39.680* :  There was a terrible flood in Zhengzhou and Hanan province three years ago,
*30:40.260- 30:43.260* :  when the civil defence was really all over the place,
*30:43.260- 30:46.480* :  and people were trying to get home in the middle of a catastrophic flood.
*30:46.480- 30:50.300* :  And they were in the underground metro, and it flooded.
*30:50.300- 30:54.300* :  So there were these images of people in underground, stalled underground,
*30:54.300- 30:57.720* :  to train with the water rising, and it was very, very bad.
*30:58.300- 31:01.020* :  Isabel Hilton, the founder of China Dialogue.
*31:01.980- 31:07.760* :  Police in Britain have charged two men with spying for China following a counterterrorism investigation.
*31:08.460- 31:11.480* :  The pair are accused of breaking the official secrets act.
*31:11.900- 31:14.540* :  Our security correspondent Gordon Carrera reports.
*31:15.220- 31:17.720* :  Christopher Berry, who's 32, and from Whitney and Oxfordshire,
*31:18.200- 31:20.700* :  and Christopher Cash, who's 29 and from London,
*31:21.260- 31:25.720* :  are charged with offences under section 1 of the 1911 official secrets act,
*31:26.400- 31:29.560* :  which relate to obtaining or communicating documents or information,
*31:30.140- 31:31.680* :  which might be useful to an enemy.
*31:32.220- 31:37.180* :  The offences are alleged to have been carried out between December 2021 and February last year.
*31:37.740- 31:41.520* :  Commander Dominic Murphy, the head of the Metropolitan Police Counterterrorism Command,
*31:41.960- 31:46.940* :  said it had been an extremely complex investigation into what are very serious allegations.
*31:47.740- 31:52.560* :  The pair were arrested in March 2023, but news only emerged last September.
*31:53.220- 31:57.060* :  It was reported then that Mr Cash was a parliamentary researcher,
*31:57.060- 32:03.620* :  involved with the China Research Group, a body set up by Conservative MPs to promote debate about the country.
*32:04.080- 32:07.660* :  A statement issued by his lawyers at the time maintained he was innocent.
*32:07.740- 32:12.920* :  A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy said it reaffirmed its comments from last September
*32:13.320- 32:18.500* :  that accusations that China was involved in stealing intelligence were completely fabricated
*32:18.820- 32:20.560* :  and nothing but malicious slander.
*32:21.080- 32:24.960* :  The two men have been bailed to appear at Westminster magistrates court on Friday.
*32:25.520- 32:31.860* :  Gordon Carrera, the dating app Grindr is being sued by hundreds of users in the UK
*32:31.860- 32:38.340* :  for allegedly sharing sensitive information, including HIV status with third parties.
*32:38.340- 32:43.660* :  It's the world's largest dating app for LGBT people, Electronics Myth reports.
*32:44.360- 32:47.600* :  The data protection lawsuit has been filed at the High Court in London.
*32:48.040- 32:53.140* :  It accuses Grindr's owners of illegally passing on the personal information of thousands of users
*32:53.540- 32:55.600* :  to advertisers for commercial purposes.
*32:55.600- 33:01.040* :  The data shared includes users HIV status and even the dates of HIV tests.
*33:01.580- 33:06.320* :  Grindr's Los Angeles-based owners say the lawsuit mischaracterizes past policies.
*33:06.320- 33:12.540* :  The breaches are alleged to have occurred prior to April 2020 when the company changed its consent mechanism.
*33:13.120- 33:17.360* :  Grindr is used by an estimated 13 million people worldwide every month.
*33:17.360- 33:20.920* :  Lawyers say thousands in the UK want to join the claim.
*33:21.320- 33:22.180* :  Electronics Myth
*33:22.940- 33:29.060* :  Five raccoons are still on the run in the Netherlands, more than a month after escaping from their zoo enclosure.
*33:29.640- 33:34.020* :  Keepers at the aqua zoo in Leo Artons say they've tried everything to recapture them,
*33:34.020- 33:40.080* :  including search parties, infrared drones and tempting treats like marshmallows and strawberry juice.
*33:40.600- 33:42.120* :  Nikki Cardwell is on that trail.
*33:45.420- 33:47.340* :  Raccoons are native to North America.
*33:47.340- 33:52.100* :  They live in wooded areas and eat anything, including the contents of rubbish bins,
*33:52.280- 33:54.320* :  hence the nickname Trash Bandits.
*33:54.760- 34:00.440* :  This tree had been living as part of a colony of 200 in woodland on the Netherlands border with Germany,
*34:01.020- 34:04.360* :  but was captured as part of a crackdown on invasive species.
*34:05.000- 34:10.500* :  The aqua zoo in Leo Artons was supposed to be their new home, but they clearly had other ideas.
*34:11.160- 34:16.520* :  On their first night at the zoo, 11 of the troop of 12 dug their way out at their enclosure.
*34:17.360- 34:21.280* :  Two didn't make it very far, they were found sleeping in a nearby tree.
*34:21.780- 34:23.320* :  Another was caught in a trap.
*34:23.740- 34:26.620* :  The prospect of cherry syrup too much to resist.
*34:27.300- 34:28.940* :  Another three were caught quickly.
*34:29.560- 34:34.580* :  The remaining five, not a trace, gone like Trash Bandits in the night.
*34:35.360- 34:39.720* :  The zoo's general manager, Jerome Lumaya, says they've done everything they can.
*34:40.000- 34:42.700* :  The police assisted us with drones, with heat cameras,
*34:42.700- 34:46.720* :  and they can see all kinds of animals like ducks, like seagulls, but no raccoons.
*34:46.780- 34:52.700* :  We patrolled at night with night vision, with infrared cameras, also with heat cameras again.
*34:52.700- 34:55.640* :  We placed traps and some local people helped us.
*34:55.640- 34:57.400* :  They stayed up during the night.
*34:57.580- 35:00.140* :  They saw like deers and others and the beaver.
*35:00.900- 35:04.500* :  They really had good nights seeing all those animals, but no raccoons.
*35:04.580- 35:05.860* :  It's very hard to find them.
*35:06.100- 35:10.720* :  He says now that the high tech approaches failed, and the sweet temptation spurned,
*35:10.720- 35:16.060* :  they may have to go old school, with wanted posters sent to all local residents.
*35:16.740- 35:18.500* :  Have you seen these raccoons?
*35:20.700- 35:24.720* :  Nikki Cardwell reporting and I hope you enjoyed those raccoons and effects I know I did.
