*01:20.960- 01:22.720* :  We hear from the Italian island of Capri
*01:22.720- 01:25.240* :  where North American and European diplomats are meeting.
*01:25.880- 01:28.260* :  Germany arrests two Russian dual national
*01:28.260- 01:30.300* :  suspected of planning sabotage attacks.
*01:31.000- 01:34.160* :  And we hear from an Israeli hostage released last year
*01:34.160- 01:36.540* :  whose husband is still a captive in Gaza.
*01:36.940- 01:38.320* :  They took us down to a tunnel.
*01:38.480- 01:39.780* :  There was no oxygen there.
*01:40.080- 01:41.120* :  And they just left us.
*01:41.360- 01:43.960* :  I can't explain what the feeling is
*01:44.340- 01:45.980* :  if not being able to breathe.
*01:45.980- 01:47.280* :  MUSIC
*01:48.920- 01:49.920* :  Also in the podcast.
*01:49.920- 01:53.160* :  The eruption was spewing materials, including small rocks.
*01:53.160- 01:55.660* :  People who live outside the exclusion zone
*01:55.660- 01:56.660* :  were also affected.
*01:56.660- 02:00.420* :  So this means the impact is more than five kilometers in radius.
*02:01.000- 02:03.660* :  A volcano erupts five times in Indonesia
*02:03.700- 02:05.520* :  triggering a tsunami alert.
*02:05.520- 02:06.760* :  MUSIC
*02:09.820- 02:11.800* :  We'll have the latest on Ukraine's hopes
*02:11.800- 02:14.020* :  of getting more air defenses in a moment.
*02:14.020- 02:17.440* :  But the meeting of the G7 group of industrialized nations
*02:17.440- 02:21.400* :  in Italy today is also talking about the mid-least conflict
*02:21.400- 02:23.900* :  following Iran's attack on Israel at the weekend.
*02:24.520- 02:26.420* :  As you may have heard in our previous podcast,
*02:26.420- 02:30.200* :  efforts to negotiate a pause in the fighting in Gaza itself
*02:30.800- 02:32.260* :  have suffered a possible setback.
*02:32.480- 02:36.180* :  After Qatar said it was reconsidering its role as a mediator
*02:36.180- 02:37.800* :  between Israel and Hamas.
*02:38.340- 02:40.420* :  The Gulf state is unhappy with what it called
*02:40.420- 02:42.920* :  political point scoring from other countries.
*02:43.440- 02:45.300* :  After a US Democratic congressman said
*02:45.300- 02:48.000* :  Qatar needed to put more pressure on Hamas.
*02:48.840- 02:50.660* :  But what does this mean for the hundred or so
*02:50.660- 02:53.940* :  Israeli hostages still thought to be held in Gaza?
*02:54.620- 02:57.500* :  Aviva Seagal was released from there in November
*02:57.500- 03:00.900* :  but her husband Keith who was also kidnapped by Hamas
*03:01.320- 03:02.240* :  is still being detained.
*03:02.900- 03:04.680* :  Lucy Manning has spoken to her
*03:05.100- 03:07.820* :  and a warning this report contains distressing details.
*03:08.760- 03:10.260* :  I'm not speaking. I'm screaming.
*03:10.900- 03:12.360* :  I need help from the whole world.
*03:12.360- 03:15.820* :  I was there for 51 days and I know what it's like.
*03:16.380- 03:19.680* :  Can you tell me a bit about the conditions that you were held in?
*03:19.980- 03:23.520* :  Keith and I were moved 13 times so with the different conditions
*03:23.640- 03:28.760* :  we made lots of terrorists and they acted brutally
*03:29.240- 03:30.760* :  in every place we went to.
*03:31.320- 03:33.620* :  One of the times they took us down to a tunnel
*03:34.060- 03:37.220* :  and there was no oxygen there and they just left us there
*03:37.720- 03:41.340* :  and I can't explain what the feeling is
*03:41.980- 03:43.600* :  if not being able to breathe
*03:43.600- 03:47.780* :  and you know that it might be your lost hours.
*03:48.060- 03:51.300* :  Keith and Aviva were also held in houses with other hostages
*03:51.780- 03:55.220* :  where she witnessed beatings and was aware of sexual assaults.
*03:55.400- 03:58.720* :  They were so mean to us they just starved us for days
*03:59.000- 04:00.160* :  and eight in front of us.
*04:00.380- 04:02.920* :  We weren't allowed to even stand and we weren't allowed to talk.
*04:03.380- 04:06.420* :  One of the days one of the girls went to the toilet
*04:07.100- 04:11.020* :  and while she came back I could see on a face that something happened
*04:11.020- 04:15.300* :  and only after a couple of hours she came and she told us.
*04:16.020- 04:17.060* :  She said he touched me
*04:17.560- 04:19.900* :  and that was one of the terrible moments
*04:19.900- 04:23.860* :  because I felt that I couldn't even look after this little girl.
*04:24.680- 04:25.680* :  She's just a child.
*04:26.280- 04:28.600* :  You were aware were you the sexual assault
*04:28.960- 04:31.240* :  was taking place on some of the female hostages?
*04:32.580- 04:35.360* :  Yes, because I was there
*04:36.560- 04:39.800* :  and I saw the girls coming after those things happening
*04:40.180- 04:41.400* :  and telling us what happened.
*04:42.240- 04:45.800* :  After 51 days in November Aviva was released
*04:46.400- 04:47.120* :  but without Keith.
*05:12.780- 05:14.160* :  It wasn't until her release
*05:14.160- 05:17.720* :  that she discovered her sunshine had survived the attack.
*05:18.460- 05:20.620* :  And when I saw shy for the first time
*05:20.960- 05:22.680* :  I couldn't stop hugging him
*05:23.440- 05:25.660* :  and I told him that I thought that he was dead.
*05:26.180- 05:28.460* :  Why do you think it is that Keith and the others
*05:28.460- 05:29.880* :  are still held after all this time?
*05:30.160- 05:33.980* :  I think that Hamas is getting the pleasure of them being there
*05:34.520- 05:35.440* :  and seeing us suffer.
*05:36.220- 05:38.500* :  I think that everybody, the whole world needs to do more.
*05:39.040- 05:39.840* :  Just get them out.
*05:40.620- 05:41.420* :  Just get them out.
*05:43.100- 05:45.740* :  Aviva Segal talking to Lucy Manning.
*05:46.600- 05:49.600* :  The G7 foreign ministers meeting on the Italian island
*05:49.600- 05:52.500* :  of Capri comes a day after Russian missiles
*05:52.500- 05:55.220* :  killed 18 people in northern Ukraine.
*05:55.920- 05:59.120* :  The Ukrainians have renewed their appeal for air defenses.
*05:59.820- 06:01.800* :  The US Congress could vote as soon as Saturday
*06:01.800- 06:04.820* :  on $60 billion worth of funding for Ukraine.
*06:04.820- 06:07.600* :  The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken
*06:07.600- 06:09.560* :  says it is a crucial moment.
*06:10.220- 06:12.480* :  If Putin is allowed to proceed with impunity
*06:13.020- 06:14.580* :  we know he won't stop at Ukraine
*06:14.580- 06:18.040* :  and we can safely predict that his aggression will continue.
*06:18.720- 06:20.360* :  Other would be aggressors around the world
*06:20.880- 06:22.980* :  will take note and unleash their own aggressions
*06:23.240- 06:24.600* :  and we will have a world of conflict
*06:25.000- 06:26.320* :  not a world of peace and security.
*06:26.880- 06:29.480* :  Anthony Blinken at the G7 in Capri.
*06:29.700- 06:31.860* :  So what more can we expect from that meeting?
*06:32.320- 06:34.360* :  Our correspondent Jessica Parker is there.
*06:34.740- 06:38.260* :  The G7, as you know, is an informal group
*06:38.500- 06:42.660* :  of wealthy nations, the EU turn up as well.
*06:42.660- 06:45.460* :  So Joseparelli's foreign policy chief is here.
*06:46.060- 06:50.120* :  Where they discuss topics that they think need addressing urgently
*06:50.120- 06:52.000* :  and one of them of course is Ukraine
*06:52.000- 06:55.220* :  and air defenses, Joseparelli arriving today
*06:55.220- 06:58.440* :  said that more needed to be done to supply Ukraine
*06:58.440- 06:59.620* :  or with air defense.
*06:59.760- 07:01.140* :  But look, that isn't new.
*07:01.760- 07:04.940* :  We've heard that before and then sometimes Ukraine
*07:04.940- 07:07.420* :  does get new supplies but clearly at that moment
*07:07.420- 07:09.020* :  it's saying it's not enough.
*07:09.740- 07:13.080* :  There have been direct comparisons made by Ukraine's foreign minister
*07:13.080- 07:15.380* :  who's also here about the support that was provided
*07:16.040- 07:18.900* :  to Israel during Saturday's attack by Iran
*07:18.900- 07:21.780* :  versus the support he feels that Ukraine is getting.
*07:22.220- 07:24.340* :  What is less clear to me at this point in the day
*07:24.340- 07:27.140* :  here in Capri is whether we are going to get
*07:27.780- 07:30.940* :  solid announcements from ministers.
*07:31.360- 07:33.600* :  Yen Stoltenberg, the NATO chief is here
*07:33.600- 07:36.320* :  so look, we'll have to see what comes out
*07:36.320- 07:37.900* :  when we hear from those ministers,
*07:37.900- 07:41.420* :  including Anthony Blinken, Lord Cameron from the UK is here
*07:41.420- 07:44.380* :  and Lena Baerbock from Germany as well.
*07:44.900- 07:48.580* :  But certainly the sense of urgency is there for delivery
*07:48.580- 07:51.080* :  but there's also been a broader issue as we know
*07:51.780- 07:54.240* :  in terms of supplying Ukraine with weapons
*07:54.240- 07:59.220* :  that the European Union and other countries in Europe
*07:59.640- 08:01.880* :  have struggled to meet that demand
*08:01.880- 08:04.640* :  and certainly speaking to defense chiefs before
*08:05.020- 08:07.640* :  there's this feeling that the industrial base just hasn't quite been there
*08:07.640- 08:09.380* :  and that takes years to build up.
*08:09.680- 08:12.820* :  I've read that Anthony Blinken is expected to raise the issue
*08:12.820- 08:16.260* :  of China helping Russia behind the scenes
*08:16.260- 08:19.280* :  and he wants Europe to put pressure on Beijing.
*08:19.280- 08:20.440* :  Can Europe do much?
*08:21.920- 08:22.820* :  Yes, it's an interesting one.
*08:22.820- 08:26.720* :  So as you say, we've heard from the State Department recently
*08:26.760- 08:28.740* :  that on an upcoming visit to China
*08:29.340- 08:32.380* :  Anthony Blinken is going to raise US concerns about
*08:32.380- 08:36.200* :  Beijing helping Russia build up its defense
*08:36.200- 08:40.300* :  and the US has been warning China not to aid Moscow's war effort
*08:40.380- 08:45.420* :  for quite some time now Chinese Embassy spokesperson
*08:46.160- 08:50.360* :  has said that China is not a party to the Ukraine war.
*08:50.580- 08:51.840* :  But in terms of Europe, I mean,
*08:52.280- 08:53.980* :  European leaders are walking quite a fine line
*08:53.980- 08:55.860* :  so I'm usually based in Berlin
*08:55.860- 08:58.940* :  and Chancellor Olaf Schultz was in China very recently
*08:59.540- 09:01.040* :  clearly trying to strike this balance
*09:01.040- 09:04.420* :  between promoting business ties with the key trading partner
*09:04.420- 09:06.120* :  still Germany's biggest trading partner
*09:06.500- 09:10.640* :  while raising concerns over issues such as
*09:11.400- 09:12.800* :  its reported support for Russia.
*09:13.480- 09:16.000* :  Jessica Parker on the Italian island of Capri
*09:16.300- 09:19.480* :  meanwhile two alleged Russian spies suspected of planning
*09:19.480- 09:21.920* :  to sabotage German aid for Ukraine
*09:21.920- 09:25.000* :  have been arrested in the southern German state of Bavaria.
*09:25.540- 09:28.180* :  The pair who have dual nationality have been accused
*09:28.180- 09:29.900* :  of scouting potential targets,
*09:29.900- 09:32.780* :  including US military facilities based in Germany.
*09:33.480- 09:35.980* :  The Russian ambassador has been called in
*09:35.980- 09:37.960* :  by the foreign ministry in Berlin.
*09:37.960- 09:40.160* :  Our correspondent there, Damian McGinnis,
*09:40.500- 09:41.880* :  told us more about the suspects.
*09:42.520- 09:45.680* :  Well, they're accused of taking photos and videos
*09:45.680- 09:49.540* :  of American and German military facilities in Bavaria
*09:50.100- 09:53.320* :  and according to German media reports here also a base
*09:53.340- 09:56.440* :  where Ukrainian soldiers are being trained
*09:56.580- 09:58.480* :  on American Abrams tanks.
*09:58.480- 10:02.840* :  Now what prosecute to say is that they were preparing information
*10:03.580- 10:07.560* :  so that an attack, a bomb attack or an arson attack
*10:07.560- 10:11.700* :  be staged on German and American military infrastructure
*10:12.280- 10:15.780* :  and in particular those bases that supply support for Ukraine
*10:16.340- 10:18.500* :  and what officials say, German officials say,
*10:18.500- 10:21.720* :  is that the aim was to carry out this attack in order
*10:21.900- 10:24.860* :  to undermine Germany's quite substantial
*10:24.860- 10:26.740* :  military support for Ukraine.
*10:26.980- 10:30.660* :  Yeah, the second largest donor of military aid to Ukraine,
*10:30.660- 10:32.300* :  what has been the reaction in Germany?
*10:33.940- 10:37.000* :  Well, the German government certainly hasn't held back all of us,
*10:37.020- 10:39.940* :  so German officials have now confirmed that the Russian ambassador
*10:39.980- 10:41.680* :  to Berlin, as you say, has been summoned
*10:41.740- 10:44.280* :  to the German foreign ministry for an explanation
*10:44.280- 10:45.780* :  over the arrest of these two men.
*10:46.260- 10:49.100* :  Germany's interior minister Nancy Faezer has said
*10:49.100- 10:52.040* :  that Germany would not allow itself to be intimidated
*10:52.040- 10:54.640* :  in her words, she said Germany would continue
*10:54.640- 10:56.520* :  its massive support for Ukraine.
*10:57.060- 10:59.320* :  And the Justice Minister, Michael Bushman,
*10:59.640- 11:02.740* :  described this as a threat that Germany had to react
*11:02.860- 11:04.920* :  to decisively and strongly.
*11:05.380- 11:07.080* :  And I think it's points to a broader concern
*11:07.080- 11:11.820* :  within Germany of the fear of Russian activities.
*11:11.820- 11:15.200* :  Germany has a huge Russian-speaking population,
*11:15.680- 11:17.880* :  most of whom are German citizens very well integrated,
*11:17.880- 11:21.180* :  part of German society, but there is also an influx as well
*11:21.720- 11:25.240* :  of people from Russia, some of them escaping conscription.
*11:25.660- 11:28.260* :  And so you have a large Russian-speaking population,
*11:28.320- 11:30.460* :  a large Russian population within Germany.
*11:30.980- 11:33.480* :  And some of those now, there is a debate or a question
*11:33.580- 11:36.200* :  about whether some of those might be loyal to the Kremlin
*11:36.200- 11:38.980* :  and might one day pose a threat to Germany,
*11:38.980- 11:41.080* :  which would be the case with these particular two men
*11:41.500- 11:43.720* :  who it sounds like from their profile.
*11:44.480- 11:46.120* :  It sounds like they grew up in Germany
*11:46.120- 11:47.620* :  or at least spent most of their lives here.
*11:48.120- 11:50.160* :  So this is a broader question about what to do
*11:50.160- 11:52.780* :  about a threat within Germany of people
*11:52.780- 11:54.540* :  who may well be loyal to Russia.
*11:55.160- 11:56.680* :  Damien McGinnis in Berlin.
*11:57.640- 12:00.380* :  Fire ants, named for the painful burning sensation
*12:00.380- 12:02.860* :  of their sting, are highly invasive.
*12:03.380- 12:06.060* :  They attack in swarms and their bite can be deadly
*12:06.060- 12:07.540* :  to animals and even humans.
*12:08.320- 12:10.920* :  Now an inquiry in Australia is set to report
*12:10.920- 12:12.900* :  on the threat from fire ants there,
*12:12.900- 12:14.820* :  with a species thought to have entered the country
*12:14.820- 12:17.040* :  in shipping containers from South America.
*12:17.420- 12:18.800* :  Filmmurcer reports from Sydney.
*12:20.340- 12:23.420* :  Sniffer dogs are on the front line in Australia's fight
*12:24.080- 12:25.940* :  against a formidable invader.
*12:26.160- 12:27.100* :  Oh mate, that's a classic.
*12:27.320- 12:28.140* :  See all these with wings?
*12:28.440- 12:29.800* :  The females ready to fly?
*12:29.980- 12:33.320* :  Fire ants are one of the world's worst invasive species.
*12:33.320- 12:36.480* :  Dr. Pam Swebson has worked on Australia's
*12:36.480- 12:39.160* :  National Fire Antiradication Program.
*12:39.500- 12:41.520* :  Any country that's been invaded by them,
*12:42.080- 12:44.100* :  has never been able to eradicate them.
*12:44.340- 12:45.840* :  Fire ants attack on mass.
*12:45.840- 12:48.700* :  They lock their jaws onto their victim's skin
*12:48.700- 12:52.020* :  and inject venom through a spike on their abdomen.
*12:52.500- 12:55.720* :  A swarm of ants will cover over the arm or leg,
*12:55.980- 12:57.360* :  whatever disturbed the nest.
*12:58.040- 13:00.520* :  And on a given signal, they'll all start to sting.
*13:00.920- 13:03.680* :  And that results in burning blisters that feel like
*13:03.780- 13:07.020* :  the people are being burnt, which is why they call fire ants.
*13:08.180- 13:10.780* :  The red-imported fire ant is one of the world's
*13:10.980- 13:15.120* :  worst invasive species, with everything from crops
*13:15.120- 13:18.360* :  to be hives to livestock known to fall victim.
*13:18.700- 13:21.480* :  The Australian Academy of Science warns the insects
*13:21.480- 13:25.400* :  have the potential to drive some animal and plant species
*13:25.400- 13:26.500* :  to extinction.
*13:27.400- 13:29.120* :  They're also a danger to people.
*13:29.120- 13:32.280* :  I was watering the garden one day and all of a sudden
*13:32.280- 13:34.700* :  I sort of felt this stinging sensation on my feet
*13:34.740- 13:37.340* :  and I looked down and they were covered in ants.
*13:37.480- 13:41.060* :  Cameron Moore lives near Brisbane and was attacked by fire ants
*13:41.080- 13:42.340* :  outside his home.
*13:42.580- 13:45.140* :  I sort of realized right away, there weren't the normal type
*13:45.140- 13:47.180* :  little black ants or green ants that I'm used to.
*13:47.420- 13:49.180* :  So I quickly hose them off.
*13:49.300- 13:51.880* :  So in the next hour or so, all these really itchy
*13:52.280- 13:54.800* :  welts came up about eight or nine on each foot.
*13:55.140- 13:57.280* :  Then once the sort of stinging eased,
*13:57.420- 14:00.540* :  then both feet started to swell and became quite itchy.
*14:00.780- 14:02.900* :  And yeah, pretty much had swell and feet
*14:02.900- 14:04.560* :  for the best part of five days afterwards.
*14:04.700- 14:06.560* :  I'm mad. You want to know why I'm mad?
*14:06.560- 14:10.320* :  Because I got bit about ten times by a bunch of fire ants.
*14:10.440- 14:12.520* :  The ants are native to South America,
*14:13.060- 14:14.440* :  but have spread to other countries,
*14:14.740- 14:17.580* :  including the United States, China and Japan,
*14:17.580- 14:20.860* :  first found in Australia in 2001,
*14:21.520- 14:24.360* :  but had probably been here undetected for years.
*14:25.300- 14:27.860* :  It's thought they hitched a ride in shipping containers.
*14:28.680- 14:31.540* :  They've now been recorded across the Queensland border
*14:31.980- 14:34.120* :  in northern parts of New South Wales.
*14:35.060- 14:38.520* :  Jack Goff is from Australia's invasive species council.
*14:38.940- 14:41.360* :  This is a huge threat to our environment,
*14:41.360- 14:42.880* :  a huge threat to our economy,
*14:43.380- 14:46.820* :  and also to the lifestyle that we expect as Australians.
*14:46.820- 14:48.660* :  In terms of just being able to send your kids
*14:49.080- 14:51.760* :  bare foot out into your backyard or turn up at your cricket game
*14:51.760- 14:54.320* :  on the weekend and not expect to be stung
*14:54.320- 14:57.860* :  and potentially put in hospital by this invasive killer pets.
*15:00.260- 15:01.940* :  The Queensland State Government says
*15:01.940- 15:04.700* :  it's a eradication programme's a world class.
*15:05.560- 15:07.480* :  And bait is dropped from helicopters
*15:08.120- 15:11.320* :  and lorries are checked for tiny unwanted hitchhikers.
*15:11.960- 15:15.480* :  But critics, though, say the system has been an absolute shambles.
*15:15.980- 15:18.700* :  They insist that Australia has underestimated
*15:18.700- 15:21.580* :  the threat from fire ants, which they believe
*15:22.040- 15:23.640* :  are spreading out of control.
*15:24.520- 15:26.200* :  Filmers are reporting from Australia.
*15:29.080- 15:31.280* :  And still to come on the Global News podcast?
*15:31.900- 15:33.040* :  I'm not going to let it!
*15:38.620- 15:42.400* :  The Japanese Animation Studio about to make film history.
*15:51.840- 15:52.560* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*15:52.760- 15:55.020* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team
*15:55.020- 15:56.740* :  if big wireless companies are allowed
*15:56.740- 15:58.620* :  to raise prices due to inflation.
*15:59.040- 15:59.660* :  They said yes.
*16:00.080- 16:01.780* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically
*16:01.780- 16:04.040* :  violates those onerous to your contracts,
*16:04.040- 16:06.420* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*16:06.420- 16:08.020* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*16:08.280- 16:10.720* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited
*16:10.720- 16:13.600* :  from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*16:13.740- 16:16.220* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.
*16:16.380- 16:17.980* :  $45 upfront for three months plus taxes and fees,
*16:17.980- 16:19.180* :  promoting for new customers for limited time.
*16:19.240- 16:20.360* :  Unlimited more than $40 gigabytes per month,
*16:20.360- 16:21.720* :  so full turns at MintMobile.com.
*16:22.380- 16:26.520* :  Honey, why are you packing a suit with swim trunks and sunscreen?
*16:26.780- 16:29.080* :  Because I can't wear the same suit for fine dining
*16:29.080- 16:31.800* :  and kayaking, total faux pas.
*16:32.040- 16:34.120* :  Then I need something casual for the roller coasters.
*16:34.540- 16:35.720* :  Oh, and the music festival.
*16:36.160- 16:37.160* :  Meetings waterside.
*16:37.620- 16:37.880* :  Really?
*16:38.360- 16:39.880* :  Looks like your work trip to Tampa Bay
*16:39.880- 16:42.420* :  just turned into a couples trip through the weekend.
*16:42.720- 16:43.460* :  I'll start packing.
*16:44.000- 16:45.360* :  Where it meets play in Tampa Bay,
*16:45.500- 16:47.440* :  where business and leisure blend perfectly.
*16:47.440- 16:50.220* :  Discover modern hotels and easy vives
*16:50.280- 16:52.020* :  at visittampabay.com.
*16:58.700- 17:01.540* :  Next to a small island in northern Indonesia,
*17:01.540- 17:03.560* :  where people have been scrambling to get away
*17:03.560- 17:04.860* :  from a volcanic eruption.
*17:11.840- 17:13.800* :  Residents trying to evacuate by boat
*17:13.840- 17:16.380* :  after Mount Rang erupted five times,
*17:16.380- 17:18.300* :  throwing rock and ash into the air
*17:18.300- 17:19.540* :  and spewing out lava.
*17:20.160- 17:22.220* :  Officials have warned that if the volcano collapses,
*17:22.220- 17:23.920* :  it could cause a tsunami.
*17:24.340- 17:25.420* :  Here's one of the rescue workers.
*17:28.140- 17:30.160* :  The eruption was spewing materials,
*17:30.160- 17:31.400* :  including small rocks.
*17:31.420- 17:33.880* :  People who live outside the exclusion zone
*17:33.880- 17:34.860* :  were also affected.
*17:35.420- 17:38.820* :  So this means the impact is more than five kilometers radius.
*17:40.460- 17:42.820* :  Well footage of the eruption makes it clear why
*17:42.820- 17:45.140* :  people would be so desperate to get away.
*17:45.140- 17:47.240* :  As I heard from our Asia Pacific editor,
*17:47.480- 17:48.140* :  Celia Hatton.
*17:48.580- 17:49.080* :  Absolutely.
*17:49.080- 17:51.880* :  I mean, it is stunning to look at all over.
*17:51.880- 17:53.660* :  I've watched this video quite a few times.
*17:53.660- 17:56.400* :  You can watch it for yourself on the BBC website.
*17:56.400- 17:58.180* :  If it wasn't so dangerous,
*17:58.300- 18:00.720* :  you'd really want to take a really good look at it.
*18:00.720- 18:03.920* :  You can see lightning striking the top of the volcano.
*18:04.740- 18:08.020* :  Bright red lava flowing down its sides.
*18:08.020- 18:10.260* :  It almost looks like what a child would draw.
*18:10.280- 18:13.040* :  If they were going to draw a typical volcano,
*18:13.040- 18:15.020* :  it's called a strato volcano.
*18:15.020- 18:17.960* :  It's got really steep sides and sticky lava
*18:17.960- 18:19.940* :  that kind of clings to the sides of it
*18:19.940- 18:21.360* :  and it goes down really slowly.
*18:21.840- 18:23.080* :  Now the worry is, though,
*18:23.240- 18:26.240* :  that this volcano will lead to a triple event.
*18:26.240- 18:29.240* :  So officials think that it's an earthquake
*18:29.260- 18:32.680* :  which triggered this volcano to erupt for the first time
*18:32.680- 18:35.160* :  in 22 years, which is quite rare to begin with.
*18:35.540- 18:37.660* :  And they think because of this type of volcano
*18:37.660- 18:39.440* :  that it is with these really steep sides,
*18:39.440- 18:42.660* :  it could lead to another rare event, a tsunami.
*18:42.660- 18:45.080* :  They're worried that the volcano itself
*18:45.080- 18:47.400* :  will lead to a debris avalanche.
*18:47.400- 18:49.900* :  So the volcano will just collapse into the water,
*18:49.900- 18:53.240* :  which such force that it will trigger a tsunami.
*18:53.240- 18:56.440* :  So the last time it happened with this particular volcano,
*18:56.440- 18:58.400* :  it was in 1871.
*18:58.620- 19:00.960* :  The last time it actually happened in Indonesia
*19:00.960- 19:02.820* :  was a few years ago in 2018,
*19:02.860- 19:06.240* :  it led to a tsunami which killed 400 people.
*19:06.540- 19:08.760* :  Yeah, you mentioned the possible collapse
*19:08.840- 19:10.040* :  of the volcano into the sea.
*19:10.040- 19:13.780* :  That's the sort of thing we saw a couple of years ago in Tonga.
*19:13.780- 19:16.060* :  Now, not right in the same area,
*19:16.060- 19:18.820* :  but both of these are part of this so-called ring of fire.
*19:19.280- 19:21.660* :  I mean, how common is this kind of thing in Indonesia?
*19:21.980- 19:23.040* :  Well, it's incredibly common.
*19:23.040- 19:26.820* :  I mean, the Pacific Ring of Fire is home to 90% of the world's
*19:26.820- 19:30.860* :  recorded earthquakes and 75% of the world's active volcanoes.
*19:30.860- 19:33.040* :  So people are really worried, though.
*19:33.080- 19:34.280* :  As you said before,
*19:34.280- 19:36.700* :  they're scrambling to get away from this region
*19:36.700- 19:38.860* :  because they're so worried about this threat of tsunami.
*19:39.260- 19:41.160* :  Right, Asia Pacific Edison, Celia Hattern.
*19:41.600- 19:45.260* :  China's economy is facing its biggest challenge in two decades.
*19:45.600- 19:47.060* :  The so-called factory of the world
*19:47.060- 19:49.940* :  is struggling to recover from years of COVID lockdowns
*19:50.020- 19:51.580* :  and a global downturn.
*19:51.980- 19:54.520* :  President Xi Jinping has responded with a plan
*19:54.520- 19:57.060* :  to make more electric cars, solar panels,
*19:57.060- 19:59.560* :  and wind turbines to sell to Europe.
*20:00.180- 20:03.860* :  But that has many Western firms worried that low-cost Chinese goods
*20:03.860- 20:05.220* :  will force them out of business.
*20:05.720- 20:07.500* :  Our China correspondent, Laura Bicke,
*20:07.500- 20:10.500* :  has been to the country's manufacturing hub to find out more.
*20:12.060- 20:13.520* :  The 54-year-old, then, when being
*20:13.900- 20:16.580* :  seems reluctant to leave the hollow-dote brick shell,
*20:17.040- 20:19.280* :  which was once a thriving factory floor
*20:19.280- 20:22.080* :  in China's manufacturing hub of Dongguan.
*20:23.360- 20:24.520* :  I feel heart-broken.
*20:24.520- 20:27.080* :  So, Asia, Dongguan, you've got spent so many years here,
*20:27.080- 20:29.300* :  and now this place has become of those
*20:29.300- 20:32.960* :  all the workers feel astonished and are disappointed.
*20:33.960- 20:36.680* :  He's not just mourning the loss of a furniture firm.
*20:37.200- 20:41.620* :  He grieves for the passing of China's once unstoppable economy.
*20:42.340- 20:45.020* :  He and 300 million workers like him
*20:45.400- 20:47.520* :  helped propel this country's growth.
*20:47.520- 20:50.800* :  They left their remote villages to work in factories,
*20:50.800- 20:53.940* :  leaving their children to be raised by their grandparents.
*20:53.940- 20:56.340* :  You stayed here, I mean, 11 years.
*20:56.340- 20:58.300* :  That's a long time. That must have hurt.
*20:58.780- 21:01.420* :  My children, of course, missed me.
*21:01.560- 21:03.000* :  There is nothing we could have done.
*21:03.300- 21:05.020* :  After the daily costs of living,
*21:05.020- 21:07.140* :  the money we sent home for our parents,
*21:07.240- 21:09.520* :  the money for our children's education,
*21:09.840- 21:11.120* :  we didn't have much left.
*21:11.120- 21:12.680* :  We had no choice.
*21:13.180- 21:15.320* :  All the migrant workers face this.
*21:16.960- 21:20.280* :  Dongguan was once the factory of the world,
*21:20.820- 21:23.000* :  but rising trade tensions with the US,
*21:23.540- 21:25.480* :  coupled with strict COVID lockdowns,
*21:25.820- 21:27.520* :  have left miles of empty buildings.
*21:29.060- 21:32.440* :  I'm wondering amongst the ruins of miles and miles,
*21:33.240- 21:34.820* :  of abandoned shoe factories,
*21:35.160- 21:37.380* :  and now instead of the sound of throngs of workers,
*21:37.380- 21:40.340* :  all you can hear is birdsong, high grasses,
*21:41.500- 21:43.600* :  and this is where your trainers were once made.
*21:44.040- 21:47.040* :  All of that production has now since moved to Southeast Asia.
*21:49.280- 21:52.480* :  But China's success is tied to its factory floors,
*21:53.000- 21:56.120* :  and the country has been finding new ways to thrive.
*21:57.580- 22:00.580* :  Fating is ramped up spending on renewable energy
*22:00.920- 22:01.840* :  and leads to the world.
*22:01.840- 22:03.700* :  In the production of solar panels,
*22:04.000- 22:06.020* :  lithium batteries and electric cars,
*22:06.840- 22:09.140* :  China's vast capacity to build
*22:09.700- 22:13.040* :  has leaders in Europe and the United States on edge.
*22:13.040- 22:14.780* :  In an exhibition park in Beijing,
*22:14.860- 22:17.500* :  thousands of green technology companies
*22:17.500- 22:19.660* :  are showing off their latest products,
*22:20.980- 22:21.880* :  focusing on green energy storage,
*22:21.880- 22:24.800* :  among them is salesperson Yanmue.
*22:28.680- 22:29.500* :  What do you think of the capacity in China
*22:30.680- 22:31.920* :  to produce this kind of green energy?
*22:33.060- 22:34.000* :  I think the Chinese company is leading
*22:34.000- 22:37.040* :  the whole energy storage market
*22:39.640- 22:41.500* :  with innovation, with new technologies right now,
*22:41.500- 22:45.900* :  I think 80 to 90 percent of the energy storage equipment
*22:46.600- 22:47.980* :  are designed and manufactured in China.
*22:51.540- 22:53.500* :  So we are leading the market in the whole world.
*22:53.500- 22:54.020* :  But Europe and the United States
*22:56.180- 22:57.360* :  for China is trying to save its own economy
*22:59.240- 22:59.420* :  by producing cut price
*22:59.420- 23:01.440* :  and state subsidized green technology
*23:03.300- 23:03.420* :  to sell abroad.
*23:04.640- 23:05.460* :  This tactic they argue is driving down
*23:05.620- 23:07.080* :  the cost of solar panels
*23:07.620- 23:09.340* :  and other emerging technology.
*23:09.900- 23:13.400* :  And driving their firms out of business.
*23:13.460- 23:15.340* :  China Correspondent Laura Bicker
*23:16.700- 23:16.880* :  Police from the UK
*23:17.720- 23:19.180* :  and 17 other countries
*23:20.860- 23:21.480* :  have broken up a cybercrime gang
*23:21.660- 23:23.440* :  that provided technology
*23:23.440- 23:25.480* :  to help criminals scam their victims.
*23:25.480- 23:26.380* :  40 people were arrested around the world
*23:29.140- 23:29.540* :  as I heard from our correspondent Tom Simons.
*23:32.020- 23:33.440* :  Will the British law enforcement agencies
*23:33.440- 23:35.440* :  have described this outfit as
*23:36.240- 23:37.440* :  crime as a service
*23:37.440- 23:39.440* :  so that's criminals offering other criminals
*23:39.440- 23:41.440* :  the technology and the training
*23:41.440- 23:42.680* :  through slick videos
*23:43.300- 23:44.840* :  to send out fishing messages
*23:45.480- 23:46.400* :  which are sent to people
*23:46.580- 23:48.260* :  in an attempt to get them to click on links
*23:48.460- 23:49.920* :  they are then taken to fake websites
*23:50.460- 23:52.060* :  which look like payment systems
*23:52.460- 23:53.760* :  or shopping sites.
*23:54.460- 23:55.540* :  The hope is among the criminals
*23:56.460- 23:57.520* :  that they will give up their credit card details
*23:58.460- 24:00.520* :  and they can be defrauded as a result.
*24:01.040- 24:03.120* :  This is a major global operation
*24:03.120- 24:04.500* :  that the police have busted
*24:04.500- 24:07.060* :  in the UK but arrests
*24:07.340- 24:09.060* :  40 plus all over the world.
*24:09.600- 24:11.220* :  And the concern is
*24:11.520- 24:13.220* :  that this sort of crime as a service
*24:13.220- 24:14.440* :  is growing, criminals
*24:15.200- 24:16.540* :  with technological knowledge
*24:17.120- 24:18.820* :  being able to offer a way of
*24:18.880- 24:20.740* :  making industrial fraud
*24:20.740- 24:21.960* :  on a global scale.
*24:22.460- 24:24.280* :  And that's really what the British police
*24:24.460- 24:26.740* :  and agencies are trying to stop.
*24:27.040- 24:29.460* :  You were at a raid here in London
*24:30.340- 24:31.380* :  and what did the police find
*24:31.380- 24:32.960* :  and tell us how they cracked the case.
*24:33.260- 24:35.260* :  Well this all started back in 2022
*24:36.140- 24:37.040* :  when a small group
*24:37.040- 24:39.040* :  of technology experts
*24:39.580- 24:41.440* :  paid for by the financial system
*24:42.280- 24:43.440* :  the financial banks for example
*24:44.920- 24:45.480* :  discovered on the dark web
*24:46.580- 24:47.380* :  information about a website
*24:47.500- 24:48.720* :  called lab hosts
*24:48.720- 24:50.300* :  which is actually on the normal internet
*24:50.580- 24:52.340* :  which was being used by these criminals
*24:52.940- 24:55.180* :  and the police began an investigation
*24:55.720- 24:56.800* :  and they managed to get
*24:56.800- 24:58.620* :  into the server which the
*24:59.000- 25:00.960* :  website was hosting data on
*25:01.420- 25:03.020* :  and from there they got the details
*25:03.040- 25:04.420* :  of all the criminals using
*25:04.460- 25:06.740* :  this service and also all
*25:06.740- 25:08.600* :  the victims and there are tens
*25:08.600- 25:10.300* :  of thousands of victims worldwide
*25:11.100- 25:12.420* :  and the interesting thing about that is
*25:12.500- 25:14.100* :  because they had all the details of the criminals
*25:14.460- 25:15.780* :  their email addresses, their phone numbers
*25:16.460- 25:17.920* :  they were able to send each of them
*25:18.560- 25:19.320* :  or about 800 of them
*25:20.460- 25:20.860* :  a personalized video
*25:22.460- 25:23.620* :  telling them exactly what data had been found
*25:24.460- 25:25.000* :  on the lab host server
*25:26.460- 25:29.440* :  and that's something a strategy
*25:29.440- 25:30.040* :  what they're trying to do is get
*25:30.460- 25:32.040* :  criminals to mistrust
*25:32.460- 25:34.160* :  or distrust other criminals
*25:34.600- 25:35.900* :  that they come across on the internet
*25:36.460- 25:37.320* :  not know when their details
*25:38.460- 25:39.000* :  are going to be revealed to the police
*25:40.460- 25:41.700* :  I was at a property in South London
*25:42.460- 25:43.360* :  police smashed the door down a
*25:44.460- 25:47.440* :  rest in a man and was searching
*25:47.440- 25:49.480* :  a garage area and the house
*25:49.480- 25:50.220* :  other people were arrested
*25:50.500- 25:53.400* :  at two airports in the UK
*25:54.620- 25:55.200* :  and so far they've arrested
*25:57.160- 25:57.440* :  24 people in the UK
*25:57.440- 25:58.440* :  clearly an ongoing investigation
*25:58.460- 26:00.240* :  a major investigation with implications
*26:00.460- 26:01.620* :  for police forces who've been
*26:02.460- 26:03.740* :  17 countries involved in this
*26:04.460- 26:06.360* :  who've been backing this UK push against cybercrime
*26:06.740- 26:07.540* :  Tom Simons
*26:08.460- 26:10.120* :  a Japanese animation studio
