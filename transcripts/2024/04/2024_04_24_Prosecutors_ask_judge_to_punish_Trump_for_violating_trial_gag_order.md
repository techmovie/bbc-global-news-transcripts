*01:25.080- 01:30.060* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 24th of April, these are our main stories.
*01:30.060- 01:39.680* :  A key witness at the Hush Money Trial of Donald Trump has said he suppressed negative stories about the former president to help him win the 2016 US election.
*01:39.680- 01:47.720* :  The Israeli military has rejected accusations that its forces buried the bodies of Palestinians at a medical compound in Gaza.
*01:47.720- 01:59.480* :  And the US Justice Department has agreed a multi-million dollar settlement with more than 100 victims of Larry NASA, the former USA Genastics Doctor jailed for sex abuse.
*02:02.120- 02:12.700* :  Also in this podcast, female patients had significantly lower mortality and readmission rates when they were treated by a female physician as compared to a male physician.
*02:12.980- 02:16.820* :  The differences between being treated by female doctors and male ones.
*02:20.740- 02:25.300* :  Donald Trump was back in court in New York on Tuesday for the second day of his trial.
*02:25.940- 02:37.080* :  The former president is accused of trying to cover up hush money payments of $130,000 to the porn star Stormy Daniels before he won the 2016 election, a charge he denies.
*02:37.600- 02:43.340* :  A key witness told the court how he suppressed negative stories about the former president to help him win.
*02:43.500- 02:53.500* :  The former publisher of the National Enquirer David Pecker said he paid for exclusive rights to such stories but didn't print them, a scheme known as Catch and Kill.
*02:54.360- 03:04.860* :  Before the continuing cross-examination of the witnesses, prosecutors asked the judge to punish Mr. Trump for violating a gagging order with his social media posts on Truth Social.
*03:05.560- 03:10.040* :  After the day's hearing, Mr. Trump came out of the courtroom and spoke to the media.
*03:10.760- 03:17.880* :  I'd love to talk to you, people. I'd love to say a good thing, it's all my mind, but I'm restricted because I have a gag order.
*03:18.600- 03:26.180* :  I think it's a disgrace, it's totally unconstitutional. I don't believe it's never not to this extent ever happened before.
*03:26.180- 03:33.780* :  I'm not allowed to defend myself and yet other people will never say whatever they want about me. Very, very unfair.
*03:34.760- 03:41.960* :  Earlier inside the courtroom, there had been fiery exchanges about the gagging order, as we heard from our correspondent, Netta Taufik.
*03:42.600- 04:01.480* :  Prosecutors are essentially saying that he willfully violated the order by posting more than 10 times on social media and his campaign website posts that attacked Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, calling Michael Cohen a serial liar, also trying to discredit Stormy Daniels.
*04:01.720- 04:15.100* :  They say that amounted to intimidating potential witnesses. They also took big issue with a post that he had quoted from somebody else where they said that undercover liberal activists were trying to get on the jury.
*04:15.100- 04:24.560* :  And prosecutors said ultimately that may have affected jury selection with one juror wanting to be excused because of the media attention around the case.
*04:24.560- 04:37.580* :  And so the judge, when he heard from Donald Trump's lawyers to hear their argument, they insisted that Donald Trump wasn't targeting any individuals that instead he was responding to political attacks that were aimed his way.
*04:37.580- 04:48.860* :  But when the judge asked for specific evidence to show what original posts he was responding to from Michael Cohen or Stormy Daniels, Todd Blanche, Donald Trump's lawyer, really struggled to provide that evidence.
*04:48.860- 05:01.820* :  And so the judge, after asking him numerous times, was exasperated. And he said, you are losing credibility with this court. So it was quite a moment, a real put down of Donald Trump's lawyers.
*05:01.820- 05:09.440* :  And even though he hasn't decided whether he will hold Donald Trump in court, it certainly looked like Donald Trump's lawyers were losing that argument.
*05:09.780- 05:15.220* :  Ms. Fali David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Inquirer, was back on the witness stand, wasn't he? Why is he important?
*05:15.960- 05:27.200* :  He is really there to help the jury understand the backdrop of this case, the kind of catch and kill scheme that prosecutors say was part of a criminal conspiracy to influence the election.
*05:27.240- 05:35.900* :  But who Donald Trump's lawyers say that kind of a catch and kill operation was just how normal newspapers worked. And there was nothing illegal about it.
*05:36.380- 05:48.180* :  So David Pecker was giving details about that. He gave a bit of history, saying that him and Donald Trump were friends, that they had a mutually beneficial relationship that went back from the 80s up until his campaign.
*05:48.180- 05:55.100* :  And how there was an agreement among friends, though nothing written down that he would help his campaign.
*05:55.860- 06:09.340* :  Netta Tafik in New York. The U.S. Justice Department has agreed a multi-million dollar settlement with more than 100 victims of Larry NASA, the former USA Gymnastics Doctor, jailed for sex abuse.
*06:09.500- 06:19.120* :  The FBI was found to have botched its investigation into NASA, which began in 2015, leaving him free to continue his assaults for months.
*06:19.940- 06:30.280* :  He abused more than 300 women and girls in total over 18 years. The Olympic champion Simone Biles was among them. Nomiya Igbal reports from Washington.
*06:30.940- 06:43.640* :  This goes all the way back to 2015 and 2016. So Larry NASA just to remind people he worked as a Michigan State University doctor. He also served as a team doctor at USA Gymnastics, which was based in Indianapolis.
*06:44.620- 06:55.180* :  And he was accused of sexually assaulting hundreds of women and girls. A report found that the FBI first learned about these allegations in 2015.
*06:55.200- 07:07.460* :  But a report found that they did not take the right investigative steps. And so that meant that NASA was free for months and months and months to abuse more women.
*07:07.460- 07:17.880* :  And that's included, as you mentioned there, the Olympic gold champion Simone Biles, also Ali Raceman, another decorated champion, Makayla Maroni, I should say.
*07:17.880- 07:28.760* :  And they gave evidence at the Senate hearing in 2021, really distressing, upsetting hearing. And so now here we are where this settlement has been announced.
*07:28.800- 07:39.280* :  It's 139 claims and made against the FBI. But it's important to note that this is just another settlement. So basically all the settlements total nearly a billion dollars.
*07:40.140- 07:55.880* :  And that's one made by USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee. So this has been going on for some years. Larry NASA himself has been jailed. He's 60 years old and it's very unlikely he will ever walk free again.
*07:56.480- 08:06.860* :  Nomiya Akbar. Israel has denied allegations by officials in her mass run southern Gaza that its forces buried the bodies of Palestinians under hospital courtyard.
*08:06.860- 08:17.500* :  UN's most senior human rights official has expressed horror at the destruction of the NASA medical complex in Han Unis and reports of mass graves at the facility.
*08:17.500- 08:20.240* :  From Jerusalem, where are Davis reports?
*08:20.980- 08:29.960* :  For several weeks earlier in the war, Israeli forces besieged and then stormed the NASA hospital complex in Han Unis. They withdrew earlier this month.
*08:30.640- 08:37.040* :  Subsequently, almost 300 bodies were reportedly found buried in the grounds of the hospital, which is in southern Gaza.
*08:37.760- 08:43.660* :  According to reports, some showed signs of having been summarily killed and others had apparently been re-buried.
*08:44.420- 08:55.120* :  Volkha Turk is the United Nations human rights chief. His spokesperson, Ravina Shamdassani, said that Mr. Turk was horrified by the destruction at NASA and reports of the graves.
*08:55.900- 09:05.140* :  We call for independent, effective, transparent investigations into the deaths. Given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators.
*09:05.140- 09:17.820* :  Hospitals are entitled to very special protection under international humanitarian law and let's be clear the intentional killing of civilians, detainees and others who are or the combat is a war crime.
*09:18.400- 09:30.120* :  The Israeli army said reports that it had buried bodies were baseless. The IDF said it examined Palestinian bodies to check they were not hostages and then returned them carefully and respectfully to their place.
*09:30.920- 09:38.380* :  200 days into the Gaza war, the Israeli army has carried out some of the heaviest shelling in recent weeks, much of it in northern Gaza.
*09:39.000- 09:46.760* :  As spokesman said that 25 targets, including military observation posts and missile launch sites, were also struck in the south.
*09:47.400- 09:48.740* :  We're a Davis in Jerusalem.
*09:50.080- 10:00.560* :  As we heard in the earlier podcast, the UK Parliament has voted through the government's Rwanda Bill, designed to deter migrants from making the dangerous journey across the English Channel.
*10:01.160- 10:05.480* :  The legislation will allow summer asylum seekers to be sent to the African country.
*10:05.500- 10:15.300* :  Meanwhile, in the Rwandan capital Kigali, the government says it's ready to start taking in migrants from the UK and to start processing their claims.
*10:15.500- 10:26.540* :  That's despite concerns outlined by Britain's Supreme Court last year that asylum seekers might not get the protection they are entitled to under international law.
*10:26.540- 10:33.340* :  And among Rwandans, there are mixed views about the deal. From Kigali, Barbara Pletasha reports.
*10:36.820- 10:41.160* :  Gardeners are trimming the wall of lushly green hedges at Rwanda's Hope Hostel.
*10:42.380- 10:44.560* :  It's here, the migrants from Britain will land.
*10:46.860- 10:51.800* :  This place has been ready for nearly two years. It's kind of eerily empty.
*10:51.800- 11:00.480* :  I'm standing in the internal courtyard looking up at three floors of rooms, freshly painted, waiting for people to fill them.
*11:01.300- 11:04.560* :  Here is a dining area combined with the kitchen.
*11:04.560- 11:08.660* :  Ismail Bikina is showing me around. He's the managing director.
*11:09.420- 11:12.200* :  You've got all sorts of staff here, even though there's no migrants here.
*11:13.580- 11:20.100* :  There are many staff. We are waiting for the asylum seekers and we have to keep our readiness there coming.
*11:22.260- 11:26.860* :  Through the windows of the hostel, you can see the rolling hills of Kigali's tidy neighborhoods.
*11:28.440- 11:35.320* :  It's a beautiful city. The streets are orderly and safe from crime, buzzing with motorcyclists wearing red and yellow helmets.
*11:36.120- 11:38.260* :  Rwanda works is the country's motto.
*11:42.700- 11:45.900* :  At this restaurant, though, there are mixed views about the migrant deal.
*11:46.580- 11:49.240* :  Businessman Immanuel Kinimba welcomes the idea.
*11:49.980- 11:54.060* :  People from different areas always bring different ideas.
*11:54.720- 12:00.040* :  And I'm sure, with the support of the government, I know it will help the country to develop further
*12:00.400- 12:02.960* :  and also enable those people to develop themselves.
*12:02.960- 12:09.520* :  I don't think it's a good idea for Britain to continue and send asylum seekers to Rwanda.
*12:09.900- 12:14.320* :  This man didn't want to identify himself talking about a view that opposed government policy.
*12:15.020- 12:18.020* :  Where are you going to find the jobs for these people?
*12:18.020- 12:24.640* :  We are so, we've graduated, but we've noted secured jobs. We are out there searching for jobs.
*12:24.940- 12:29.920* :  There is a culture of fear here amid widespread allegations that dissent is suppressed.
*12:30.720- 12:35.440* :  Victoria Ingebir is an opposition figure once jailed on charges of threatening state security.
*12:36.320- 12:38.940* :  She thinks the asylum seekers are getting a bad deal.
*12:39.660- 12:47.700* :  There are people who fled the country because of poverty, because of the war, because of the dictatorship they have in the country.
*12:48.220- 12:55.080* :  And they will come in the country where they will confess the same problems, where they cannot express themselves.
*12:56.200- 12:59.320* :  Where they will not have the well-being, they are looking in the UK.
*12:59.780- 13:08.480* :  Kegali strongly denies this, and its parliament recently passed a law to address the concerns of Britain's Supreme Court
*13:08.480- 13:11.120* :  to strengthen protections for asylum seekers.
*13:11.640- 13:15.800* :  I spoke with Doris Uichese Picard, the top official in charge of the agreement.
*13:16.500- 13:20.280* :  If the refugees coming here want to hold a protest, can they do it?
*13:20.800- 13:23.340* :  Our national laws are very clear about the right to protest.
*13:24.000- 13:27.020* :  Eight is protected under specific circumstances.
*13:27.100- 13:32.360* :  And if they do wish to protest peacefully within the confines of the law, they are welcome too.
*13:35.600- 13:41.400* :  I've arrived at a transit camp for refugees who had been stuck in Libya and were having a very hard time there.
*13:41.400- 13:45.400* :  And so they were brought here as a sort of emergency measure.
*13:45.400- 13:53.340* :  And this is the project that the Rwandan government talks about when it says it's perfectly capable of looking after refugees and asylum seekers.
*13:58.900- 14:01.760* :  They get three meals a day served in this dining room.
*14:03.820- 14:07.440* :  Here I met Daniel Liu, a tall, thin young man from South Sudan.
*14:08.280- 14:11.980* :  He tells me he's looking for work to support the family he left behind in the village.
*14:12.720- 14:16.460* :  He tried seven times to cross the sea from Libya to Italy.
*14:17.080- 14:18.860* :  And he doesn't want to stay in Rwanda.
*14:19.560- 14:21.420* :  I want to have a chance to go to another country.
*14:21.800- 14:23.940* :  I can't be able to get a job here.
*14:24.280- 14:28.100* :  But I was pretty hard to get the chance to get out in Rwanda.
*14:28.500- 14:33.380* :  If you had made it to Europe and that European country sent you back, not to Libya, but to Rwanda.
*14:33.660- 14:34.540* :  How would that make you feel?
*14:34.820- 14:38.940* :  I cannot do anything because it's not in my hand.
*14:39.280- 14:44.200* :  It's all about seeking a better future for those here and those coming.
*14:45.080- 14:49.300* :  Will Rwanda be a detour for them, a dead end, or a new home?
*14:51.540- 14:53.260* :  Barbara Pletasha in Rwanda.
*14:54.500- 15:02.300* :  If you're in hospital, a new study suggests that you're slightly less likely to die or be re-admitted if your doctor is a woman.
*15:02.620- 15:13.080* :  The study published in the American Journal Annals of Internal Medicine looked at hundreds of thousands of insurance claims between the years 2016 and 2019.
*15:13.920- 15:16.740* :  Lisa Rottenstein was involved in the study.
*15:16.740- 15:24.700* :  She is a primary care physician herself and associate professor at the University of California San Francisco Health Center.
*15:25.220- 15:28.340* :  Julian Marshall asked her if she was surprised by the findings.
*15:29.060- 15:30.100* :  I don't think I was surprised.
*15:30.500- 15:39.580* :  This is consistent with prior studies showing better outcomes for patients treated by female physicians, both in the outpatient setting, in the inpatient setting.
*15:39.580- 15:43.820* :  We know that patients treated by female surgeons have better outcomes.
*15:43.820- 15:55.260* :  But I think what this study adds is the additional nuance, helping us understand that the particular benefit of being treated by a female physician was for female patients.
*15:55.500- 16:04.080* :  We know that patients who had significantly lower mortality and re-admission rates when they were treated by a female physician as compared to a male physician.
*16:04.620- 16:07.080* :  This has to have a look at the statistics.
*16:07.500- 16:19.340* :  The mortality rate for female patients was 8.15% when treated by women physicians in comparison to 8.38%.
*16:19.960- 16:25.800* :  When the doctor was male on the face of it, that is an almost insignificant difference.
*16:26.500- 16:30.060* :  These are large sample sizes and so it's important to put it into context.
*16:30.800- 16:36.680* :  And this translates to one additional death per every 420 hospital admissions.
*16:37.500- 16:47.000* :  If those patients were treated by male physicians rather than female physicians, or you can think about it the other way once you are death when those patients were treated by a female physician.
*16:47.720- 16:50.400* :  Let's see the question has to be why.
*16:50.940- 16:53.020* :  Why is that this difference?
*16:53.580- 17:01.320* :  A number of studies have really dug into the ways in which female physicians may practice differently and interact with their patients differently.
*17:01.500- 17:09.340* :  While this particular study doesn't tell us about those mechanisms, it really sheds a light on what we need to delve further into.
*17:09.760- 17:15.320* :  And particularly we need to understand how those differential behaviors may be driving the differences we see.
*17:15.740- 17:20.340* :  For example, studies have shown that female physicians spend more time with their patients.
*17:20.900- 17:28.360* :  They are more likely to communicate in patient centered ways and ways that involve their patients in medical decision making.
*17:28.860- 17:32.520* :  Female physicians exchange more messages with their patients.
*17:33.060- 17:40.620* :  And so we know that these behaviors are beneficial and likely underlying some of the differences we saw in this study.
*17:41.420- 17:45.680* :  I think it's particularly interesting the differences we saw for female patients.
*17:46.380- 17:52.820* :  The literature has shown us that female patients may be less likely to have their symptoms believed.
*17:52.820- 17:55.780* :  They may be less likely to have their pain treated.
*17:56.400- 18:02.340* :  Their symptoms may be exhibited in different ways than male patients exhibit their symptoms.
*18:03.000- 18:13.160* :  And so what this study suggests is that having a female physician may be particularly beneficial in terms of female patients having their concerns and issues addressed.
*18:13.160- 18:18.960* :  And this can end up in a difference actually in mortality and read missions for hospitalized patients.
*18:19.960- 18:28.880* :  So what does this tell us about the changes that need to be made in medical practices in the United States?
*18:28.880- 18:35.920* :  Do you need to teach male doctors to behave more like female doctors?
*18:36.540- 18:37.500* :  It's a great question.
*18:38.060- 18:49.680* :  So to some extent, yes, we should be encouraging the behaviors that we find are related to these beneficial outcomes, the patient centeredness, the time with patients, believing patient symptoms.
*18:50.520- 18:57.640* :  There's another piece of it though that we should also be thinking about how to incentivize these behaviors because we can teach all we want.
*18:57.640- 19:10.780* :  And then if payment is based on the number of patients you have seen or if there are incentives related to getting patients out of the hospital faster, what we have taught may not be practiced if it is not financially incentivized.
*19:11.240- 19:29.620* :  So the other piece of the puzzle is paying for care in a way that rewards good outcomes rather than volume and helping all physicians feel like the careful, thoughtful patient centered care we think is delivered by female physicians can be realistically delivered by all physicians.
*19:30.620- 19:34.580* :  Lisa Rottenstein, Associate Professor at the University of California.
*19:37.360- 19:37.960* :  Still to come.
*19:38.120- 19:46.240* :  I do think that mentally I don't think you really do get old, my grandma's 94 and I don't wouldn't say she's old, she's got great vibes.
*19:46.920- 19:48.840* :  So at what age do we get old?

*21:05.480- 21:09.280* :  A US military plane has landed in the Haitian capital port of Prince.
*21:09.280- 21:16.700* :  The first aircraft to touch down since the international airport closed on the 4th of March due to attacks by criminal gangs.
*21:17.480- 21:20.960* :  Haitian media, say the authorities are expecting other planes to follow.
*21:21.560- 21:25.000* :  It isn't known who or what the US cargo plane was carrying.
*21:25.820- 21:32.500* :  On Monday, the United Nations Security Council was told the situation in Haiti is catastrophic and getting worse every day.
*21:33.280- 21:42.840* :  Catherine Russell of the UN Children's Agency UNICEF told the meeting in New York that the capital port of Prince was almost completely cut off by violent gangs.
*21:43.480- 21:51.620* :  Five and a half million people, including three million children or two in every three children across the country, need humanitarian assistance.
*21:52.440- 21:58.700* :  In many areas, essential services have collapsed while people are losing access to food and safe drinking water.
*21:59.080- 22:02.600* :  And in some communities, life is more dangerous now than it has ever been.
*22:03.180- 22:07.720* :  The BBC received a message from a woman in Port of Prince who wants to remain anonymous.
*22:08.520- 22:11.360* :  Because of what's happening now, I worldly go outside.
*22:11.900- 22:18.360* :  The banks in my area stay closed and the streets are almost empty.
*22:18.500- 22:30.180* :  School stays closed too. And as a teacher, I have to teach online, which is heard because not everyone has access to electricity or electronic devices.
*22:30.800- 22:35.740* :  Luke Jones heard more from a local journalist Harold Isaac, who is also in Port of Prince.
*22:36.340- 22:43.480* :  You have to pretty much think about everything you're doing, your commute, your supplies, your work, if ever you can't attend it.
*22:43.980- 22:59.500* :  And because there's been a flare up in gang violence over the weekend, and yesterday the gang coalition living together led by Barbecue caught off access again to the main oil terminal of the country, the Valor terminal.
*22:59.500- 23:08.380* :  And has got access to the CPS port facilities, which allow for containers to be released into the country with supplies that people really directly need.
*23:08.780- 23:19.460* :  And why are the gangs continuing with violence? Because at one point, their main aim, it seems, was to unseat the Prime Minister. They achieved that. Why are they still wreaking havoc, do you think? What are they saying?
*23:19.680- 23:29.480* :  That's the question everybody's asking. Now, what is being discussed is that they are not getting what they are requesting, which is to have either a Supreme Court judge,
*23:29.480- 23:40.260* :  lead the transition or the ex-rebo Quiffilique. As it stands right now, the presidential council is about, you know, to be, to be installed sometime this week.
*23:41.000- 23:46.000* :  And that doesn't, it doesn't do it for them. Harold Isaac, a journalist in Haiti.
*23:46.680- 23:57.600* :  There's more bad news for the electric car manufacturer, Tesla. It's reported a huge fall in profits down more than 50% in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year.
*23:57.920- 24:00.720* :  These are North America business correspondent Erin Delmo.
*24:01.220- 24:09.120* :  It's been a rocky road for Tesla this year. Higher interest rates are taking a bite out of consumers purchasing power and pushing big purchases out of reach.
*24:09.700- 24:19.600* :  Competition with China, especially rival electric vehicle maker BYD is heating up. Sales have been falling, and so is Tesla's stock. It's down more than 40% this year.
*24:19.600- 24:29.540* :  The company has been cutting prices and announced layoffs. And then on Tuesday, the company reported its first quarter earnings, missing expectations on earnings and revenue.
*24:29.920- 24:33.640* :  And the company is anticipating lower deliveries this year compared to 2023.
*24:33.640- 24:40.520* :  But investors have one bright spot to look to. Tesla announced its speeding up the launch of a lower priced vehicle.
*24:41.140- 24:49.120* :  More affordable models could be a boon for cash-strapped US consumers and a hit in big competitive markets worldwide like China and India.
*24:49.760- 25:00.900* :  Erin Delmo. When Kareem Buyeh Roshan was arrested in Marbella in January, the Spanish authorities proudly declared that they had caught one of Europe's most wanted.
*25:01.320- 25:06.300* :  A man who headed up the notorious and violent cocaine cartel, Morco Mafia.
*25:06.960- 25:15.740* :  But now he's on the run after being released on bail, and it's looking like a blunder that could have significant ramifications for the safety of a European princess.
*25:16.400- 25:20.140* :  The authorities are having to explain how he slipped through their fingers.
*25:20.760- 25:24.060* :  Our Europe Regional Editor Nikki Cardwell is following the case.
*25:24.520- 25:29.480* :  This man has been part of a cocaine cartel that's been dealing across Europe.
*25:29.900- 25:35.960* :  A lot of this is to do with ports and chains of supply lines, and he was one of the leaders of it.
*25:36.240- 25:42.140* :  He's actually a Dutch resident. That is where the interesting part of this story comes in.
*25:42.140- 25:53.080* :  You may remember earlier in the year, the Dutch royal family said that the heir to the throne, Princess Amalia, had been living in Spain in hiding because of threats to her life.
*25:53.840- 25:58.160* :  They were from this gang, who've also added kidnap and extortion.
*25:58.540- 26:03.440* :  Another name that came up that they'd also targeted was Mark Rutter, the Prime Minister.
*26:03.480- 26:11.900* :  So he was wanted all over Europe, but the Dutch were particularly keen to see him in court over there.
*26:12.240- 26:17.620* :  So he was wanted all over Europe, he was arrested, and now he's at large. How did this happen?
*26:17.640- 26:30.700* :  He appeared in court, his preliminary hearing was in one of the lower courts, and at that time, as soon as he was arrested, the Dutch applied for extradition, saying they were very serious charges, and they wanted to see him over there.
*26:31.160- 26:36.300* :  This court said, no, he was charged with very serious offenses in Spain, and he'd had to be tried there.
*26:36.880- 26:49.980* :  And somewhere, in between more senior people talking, he's appeared in court in March, and has been given bail, 50,000 euros bail, and has been allowed out of court.
*26:49.980- 26:55.420* :  He was supposed to appear back in court at the beginning of April, which he did, but two weeks later, he did not.
*26:55.560- 27:05.380* :  So they have any idea where he might have gone? No, we have heard from the Spanish authorities who say they think their security services are going to find him, but they don't know where he is.
*27:05.380- 27:11.820* :  There are reports that he's left the country, but it's a case of watch this space. The Dutch are not impressed.
*27:12.580- 27:13.620* :  That was Nikki Cardwell.
*27:14.780- 27:23.720* :  Four spears taken by the British explorer Captain James Cook, when he first landed in Australia, have been returned after more than 250 years.
*27:23.720- 27:31.160* :  They were given back to representatives from the La Parouse, Aboriginal community, and a ceremony at Trinity College in Cambridge.
*27:31.680- 27:33.920* :  Our culture reporter Noan Andi was there.
*27:37.500- 27:46.480* :  Representities of the La Parouse Aboriginal community took part in a procession at Trinity College's Ren Library this morning to witness the handover ceremony.
*27:47.380- 27:54.820* :  The weapons were taken from a local camp when the British expedition arrived in Australia in 1770 at the site of modern-day Sydney.
*27:54.820- 28:04.120* :  They were given to Trinity College Cambridge the following year when Captain Cook returned to England on the end of the day, and they have been part of the college's collection ever since then.
*28:05.200- 28:11.120* :  Now they've been formally handed back. Ray Ingrid from the La Parouse community said he welcomed the move.
*28:11.500- 28:32.980* :  The spears have a very spiritual importance to our people at Botany Bay, and having them returned after all this time, and having them displayed at the very point they were taken in 1770, ensures that we were able to amplify the significance of the spears, but also the events that occurred on that day.
*28:33.360- 28:41.000* :  Campaigners have long called for the repatriation of the spears to Australia when members of the local community still use similar fishing spears.
*28:41.440- 28:47.060* :  Last year, Trinity College agreed to return them permanently as Professor Nicholas Thomas explained.
*28:47.600- 28:53.980* :  The spears were taken without the consent of the Guayagal people just over 250 years ago.
*28:53.980- 28:58.600* :  It's right that they are returned, but it is also positive that they are returned.
*28:58.960- 29:01.180* :  Why has it taken so long to return the spears?
*29:01.460- 29:10.160* :  Returns processes are complex. In the past, requests were made that were not supported by the indigenous peoples themselves.
*29:10.160- 29:17.860* :  The college is the latest in the long line of institutions to hand back artifacts taken from around the world by British explorers.
*29:18.400- 29:19.040* :  No, Nanji.
*29:20.180- 29:22.600* :  At what age do we become old?
*29:23.260- 29:29.900* :  A study by Humboldt University in Berlin has found that pensioners now believe old age starts at nearly 75.
*29:30.120- 29:34.340* :  That's four years older than what pensioners in the 1970s considered old.
*29:34.880- 29:42.960* :  The researchers say it may be down to longer life expectancy or better health in old age, or a more or less positive view of aging.
*29:43.620- 29:49.960* :  Sarah Montague spoke to Baroness Joan Bakewell, an author and playwright, and also Janelle Aumoyi.
*29:50.280- 29:53.080* :  The BBC's TikTok reporter, yes, we have one of those.
*29:53.360- 29:57.880* :  She first asked Joan Bakewell if she considered herself someone who's old.
*29:58.660- 29:59.640* :  I'm in my nineties.
*30:00.140- 30:01.360* :  And Janelle, you're not.
*30:02.040- 30:04.200* :  No. You're in your 20s.
*30:04.620- 30:05.280* :  A Chinese, yeah.
*30:05.580- 30:05.760* :  Okay.
*30:06.320- 30:08.160* :  Janelle, what do you think of as old?
*30:08.240- 30:10.220* :  When do you think you will be old at what age?
*30:10.520- 30:12.820* :  Do you know what? I don't think I actually will.
*30:12.820- 30:19.440* :  I think I can get old physically, but I do think that mentally I don't think you really do get old.
*30:19.440- 30:24.140* :  My grandma's 94 and I wouldn't say she's old. She's quite, you know, she's got great vibes.
*30:24.200- 30:29.560* :  I think now we're kind of looking a little bit to our inner child when we talk about ourselves.
*30:30.120- 30:32.040* :  Joan, when did you become old?
*30:32.060- 30:34.340* :  I'm assuming you would describe yourself as old now.
*30:34.640- 30:41.300* :  I think it's fair to say that once you've hit 90, you consider it old and considered by yourself to be old.
*30:41.920- 30:45.740* :  Where I notice it most, because although I feel young in heart,
*30:46.160- 30:49.980* :  is that I'm divorced from pop culture, young culture.
*30:50.400- 30:52.320* :  I've found that very hard to follow now.
*30:52.720- 30:53.780* :  I don't understand this.
*30:53.800- 30:58.620* :  I don't really share it and quite bewildered by it, even though I follow it to some extent.
*30:58.680- 31:02.520* :  I'm just curious. Did you, did you not think you were old until you hit 90?
*31:02.840- 31:05.580* :  I think late middle age goes on until you're 80.
*31:05.900- 31:06.880* :  This is wonderful.
*31:07.460- 31:09.980* :  Okay, I thought I was really rapidly approaching old age.
*31:10.460- 31:17.140* :  But Janelle, I was quite interested that you think you were equating being old with not being,
*31:17.520- 31:19.380* :  well, I suppose, having mentally young.
*31:19.580- 31:25.480* :  Yes. I think that that's kind of what younger people kind of think now.
*31:25.480- 31:30.480* :  They do think, you know, I am young, but younger people are also in their 40s.
*31:30.700- 31:33.720* :  I wouldn't necessarily say like 40s or being your 50s is old.
*31:34.180- 31:36.560* :  We're seeing things like shows like Sex in the City.
*31:36.560- 31:40.100* :  That came out years ago, about 10 years ago, 10, 20 years ago,
*31:40.520- 31:45.120* :  and it was showing a group of women in their 40s dating and kind of living that life
*31:45.160- 31:49.360* :  that you'd kind of expect to see young women in their 20s.
*31:49.600- 31:52.080* :  So I think things like that have changed social norms,
*31:52.080- 31:56.860* :  so that now you kind of just, you just feel like, you know, you're the age you feel.
*31:57.200- 32:01.220* :  Joan, I mean, in a way, you said you can't keep up with sort of young culture.
*32:01.220- 32:03.960* :  I guess some of the stuff that Janelle is talking about there.
*32:04.400- 32:08.060* :  But so how, I'm curious about how we then judge being old.
*32:08.180- 32:11.500* :  Is it really just down to what mental attitude?
*32:12.300- 32:15.820* :  I think you're judging from where you actually sit in your own life.
*32:16.420- 32:20.280* :  If you've got grandchildren, you see, who follow the young culture?
*32:20.440- 32:22.600* :  And I try to catch up with them.
*32:23.020- 32:26.460* :  I think it depends on your community.
*32:27.100- 32:30.920* :  I think it depends on your well-being, your concern for yourself,
*32:30.920- 32:35.620* :  your ability to be part of a community, to be out and active in the world.
*32:36.140- 32:39.680* :  All these things matter, and they're not matter of numbers at all.
*32:39.680- 32:44.360* :  The author and playwright, Joan Bakewell and Janelle are one more year.
*32:44.720- 32:46.660* :  The BBC's TikTok reporter.
*32:49.520- 32:50.660* :  And that's it from us for now.
*32:50.660- 32:53.520* :  There will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*32:53.520- 32:57.240* :  We'd like to comment on this edition or the topics covered in it.

*33:08.920- 33:10.660* :  The producer was Liam McCheffrey.
*33:10.840- 33:13.440* :  Our editor is Karen Martin. I'm Jackie Leonard.
*33:13.840- 33:15.420* :  And until next time, goodbye.
*33:23.860- 33:25.740* :  Do you ever feel like your brain is on overdrive?

*34:23.160- 34:28.660* :  I'm Mark Lohan from the Global Story Podcast, where we're looking at divided opinions over the man leading
*34:28.660- 34:30.460* :  one and a half billion Catholics.
*34:30.960- 34:37.560* :  Some see Pope Francis as too liberal, particularly on LGBTQ issues, while others see him as not progressive enough,
*34:37.560- 34:43.320* :  especially after a recent document he signed, condemning gender theory, reassignment and surrogacy.
*34:43.800- 34:47.560* :  So how much of a reformer is he, and how woke is the Pope?
