*01:25.040- 01:27.220* :  I'm Paul Moss, and in the early hours of Wednesday,

*01:33.700- 01:35.920* :  This is the beautiful, fragrant, aromatic rice

*01:42.400- 01:44.040* :  prompts widespread condemnation.

*01:55.600- 01:58.040* :  about his latest film, Civil War.
*01:58.440- 01:59.700* :  This film is about journalists,
*02:00.240- 02:01.780* :  and it's about polarisation,
*02:01.820- 02:04.000* :  populist politics and polarisation,
*02:04.060- 02:06.800* :  which leads to extremism and extremist thinking.
*02:07.020- 02:08.140* :  That's happening in America,
*02:08.180- 02:09.880* :  but it's happening in this country.
*02:12.800- 02:13.820* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:13.820- 02:15.240* :  the theatre in Paris
*02:15.240- 02:17.760* :  much should do about a washing machine.
*02:18.340- 02:19.140* :  At the end of the play,
*02:19.140- 02:21.660* :  some people started to insult each other
*02:21.800- 02:22.840* :  inside the theatre.
*02:23.380- 02:25.700* :  They almost started to fight physically.
*02:26.360- 02:30.400* :  Plus, why are there now a record-breaking number of billionaires?
*02:34.640- 02:37.740* :  There's been widespread condemnation of an Israeli strike
*02:37.740- 02:40.100* :  which killed seven aid workers in Gaza.
*02:40.660- 02:43.400* :  Among the dead was an American with dual citizenship,
*02:43.400- 02:44.980* :  a pole, an Australian,
*02:45.480- 02:46.800* :  and three British citizens.
*02:46.800- 02:50.080* :  The US was just one among many international voices
*02:50.080- 02:51.320* :  to express its outrage,
*02:51.760- 02:54.900* :  demanding Israel do more to protect those providing support
*02:54.900- 02:56.280* :  for Gaza's Palestinians.
*02:56.980- 02:58.740* :  The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak
*02:58.740- 03:02.020* :  spoke directly to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu,
*03:02.560- 03:06.320* :  calling for a thorough and transparent independent investigation.
*03:07.180- 03:08.720* :  More details have already emerged
*03:08.720- 03:10.880* :  about exactly how the attack happened.
*03:11.420- 03:13.500* :  We now know that three vehicles were hit,
*03:13.560- 03:15.800* :  apparently while they were some distance apart.
*03:16.580- 03:18.500* :  Now that's important because if true,
*03:18.500- 03:21.920* :  it would suggest each of them was individually targeted.
*03:22.440- 03:25.320* :  From Jerusalem, here's our correspondent Hugo Bicega.
*03:25.620- 03:28.720* :  The World Central Kitchen team was traveling at night
*03:28.720- 03:31.620* :  in a clearly marked convoy of three cars
*03:32.040- 03:34.000* :  on a coastal road in central Gaza.
*03:34.740- 03:37.360* :  The organization said the group had left a warehouse
*03:37.860- 03:41.320* :  after unloading a hundred tons of humanitarian aid
*03:41.780- 03:44.080* :  and that its movements had been coordinated
*03:44.540- 03:45.540* :  with Israeli military.
*03:46.260- 03:48.100* :  The three cars were struck separately
*03:48.100- 03:50.180* :  by the Israeli military for reasons
*03:50.500- 03:51.560* :  that are still not clear.
*03:52.300- 03:53.520* :  Seven workers were killed,
*03:53.520- 03:55.480* :  including three British nationals.
*03:55.920- 03:57.800* :  They've been named as John Chapman,
*03:58.100- 03:59.900* :  James Henderson, and James Kirby.
*04:00.620- 04:02.300* :  Citizens from Australia, Poland,
*04:02.700- 04:04.740* :  and the United States were also killed.
*04:05.400- 04:07.180* :  One of them, LaZelmi Franco,
*04:07.180- 04:08.020* :  from Australia,
*04:08.020- 04:11.000* :  had posted this video on social media last month.
*04:17.060- 04:18.160* :  This is the beautiful,
*04:18.160- 04:20.640* :  fragrant, aromatic rice that will be served today
*04:20.640- 04:21.780* :  from General Balafici.
*04:22.220- 04:22.580* :  Thank you.
*04:22.960- 04:25.420* :  World Central Kitchen is one of the main organizations
*04:25.500- 04:26.860* :  operating in Gaza.
*04:27.460- 04:32.020* :  Its CEO, Aaron Gore, said this had been a targeted attack
*04:32.020- 04:33.220* :  by the Israeli military,
*04:33.600- 04:35.160* :  calling it unforgivable.
*04:35.720- 04:38.260* :  The group has announced it is suspending its activities
*04:38.260- 04:38.920* :  in the region.
*04:42.060- 04:44.240* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*04:44.620- 04:46.960* :  said this was a tragic incident,
*04:47.400- 04:48.760* :  but unintentional.
*04:49.420- 04:51.040* :  It happens in war, he said.
*04:51.900- 04:54.240* :  But the air strike has sparked disbelief
*04:54.520- 04:57.200* :  and anger among other aid organizations
*04:57.620- 04:59.980* :  and countries whose citizens were among the dead.
*05:00.760- 05:02.500* :  In a call with Mr. Netanyahu,
*05:02.600- 05:05.620* :  Rishi Sunak said he was appalled by the incident
*05:05.940- 05:07.680* :  and described the situation in Gaza
*05:08.000- 05:09.900* :  as increasingly tolerable.
*05:10.500- 05:12.600* :  The U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken,
*05:12.920- 05:14.340* :  paid tribute to the victims
*05:14.860- 05:16.300* :  and called for accountability.
*05:16.860- 05:17.560* :  These people are heroes.
*05:19.000- 05:21.360* :  We shouldn't have a situation where
*05:22.240- 05:23.680* :  people who are simply trying to help
*05:23.680- 05:24.880* :  their fellow human beings
*05:26.120- 05:28.220* :  are themselves at grave risk.
*05:30.160- 05:33.640* :  We spoken directly to the Israeli government
*05:33.640- 05:35.380* :  about this particular incident.
*05:36.380- 05:37.740* :  We've urged a swift,
*05:38.780- 05:41.240* :  a thorough and impartial investigation.
*05:42.100- 05:44.500* :  The incident will add more pressure on Israel
*05:45.100- 05:47.220* :  over the way it is conducting its war
*05:47.220- 05:48.800* :  against Hamas in Gaza,
*05:49.320- 05:52.500* :  where more than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed
*05:53.000- 05:55.640* :  and a humanitarian crisis only gets worse.
*05:56.360- 05:57.720* :  Hugo Bachega in Jerusalem.
*05:58.540- 06:00.180* :  The deaths of those aid workers
*06:00.180- 06:02.240* :  may be tragic, but as we heard there,
*06:02.700- 06:04.800* :  the fact is that Israel's war on Gaza
*06:04.800- 06:07.400* :  has killed more than 30,000 people
*06:07.400- 06:08.880* :  according to the authorities there,
*06:09.140- 06:10.220* :  most of them civilians,
*06:10.660- 06:13.180* :  and even more could die if famine takes hold
*06:13.180- 06:15.380* :  as many agencies are worn and could happen.
*06:16.240- 06:18.440* :  So this is just about the worst time
*06:18.520- 06:20.520* :  for the people supplying food to Gaza
*06:20.900- 06:22.080* :  to halt their operations.
*06:22.500- 06:24.520* :  Yet that is what some have said they're doing
*06:24.520- 06:26.040* :  in the wake of the latest killings.
*06:26.320- 06:28.400* :  Matthew Hollingworth from the World Food Program
*06:28.800- 06:30.660* :  says change is urgently needed.
*06:31.060- 06:33.940* :  Humanitarians should be protected, respected.
*06:34.560- 06:37.800* :  We should have access to reach everywhere we need to reach.
*06:38.400- 06:40.000* :  We should be able to work
*06:40.560- 06:42.180* :  and notify and coordinate
*06:42.800- 06:44.420* :  in the fastest means possible
*06:44.840- 06:48.660* :  and have real time feedback from the IDF
*06:48.660- 06:50.680* :  and other actors in the conflict
*06:51.000- 06:53.380* :  so that we can move about safely and do our jobs.
*06:53.900- 06:55.160* :  We are there to save lives.
*06:55.620- 06:58.440* :  So it's not only about an investigation we need change.
*06:59.300- 07:01.200* :  There is a longstanding system by which
*07:01.200- 07:02.220* :  the Israeli military
*07:02.220- 07:04.520* :  are kept informed of aid workers' movements,
*07:05.040- 07:07.600* :  precisely so that they don't end up killing people
*07:08.140- 07:10.320* :  who only came to Gaza to help save lives.
*07:10.800- 07:12.660* :  Our world affairs correspondent Paul Adams
*07:12.720- 07:15.440* :  told me how this system is supposed to work.
*07:15.960- 07:17.580* :  It involves essentially something very simple
*07:17.580- 07:19.200* :  which is making sure the warring part
*07:19.200- 07:20.600* :  is no where you are,
*07:21.060- 07:21.760* :  where you're going,
*07:22.160- 07:22.860* :  when you're going,
*07:23.280- 07:24.640* :  what vehicles you're driving in.
*07:24.740- 07:26.100* :  And even though that sounds simple,
*07:26.280- 07:28.540* :  aid agency people who I've spoken to say
*07:29.040- 07:30.820* :  that it's incredibly time consuming,
*07:31.200- 07:32.800* :  you have to be on the phone constantly
*07:32.800- 07:35.620* :  to let the Israelis know where you are
*07:35.620- 07:36.840* :  and where you're moving next.
*07:36.960- 07:38.300* :  And clearly, as we've seen,
*07:38.660- 07:39.680* :  it is not infallible.
*07:40.040- 07:41.480* :  Yes, because we've heard that
*07:41.480- 07:44.000* :  aid agencies have complained for a long time
*07:44.000- 07:45.020* :  before this incident
*07:45.020- 07:47.260* :  that their personnel were not necessarily
*07:47.260- 07:49.000* :  being protected the way they should be.
*07:49.360- 07:51.540* :  That's right. There is quite a long list now
*07:51.540- 07:52.380* :  of episodes
*07:53.060- 07:55.320* :  when one agency or another has complained
*07:55.320- 07:56.500* :  that their headquarters
*07:56.500- 07:58.740* :  or their personnel have been targeted.
*07:59.340- 08:01.420* :  There was a case back in early February
*08:01.420- 08:03.180* :  in which a UN convoy
*08:03.740- 08:04.860* :  interestingly carrying food
*08:04.860- 08:06.240* :  from the very same organization,
*08:06.240- 08:07.600* :  the World Central Kitchen,
*08:08.220- 08:10.980* :  was targeted by naval gunfire
*08:11.140- 08:12.040* :  on the coast road.
*08:12.340- 08:13.780* :  And that led to the complete suspension
*08:13.900- 08:15.460* :  of UN Convoys to the north
*08:15.600- 08:16.760* :  for a period of time.
*08:16.920- 08:18.360* :  And so there is a feeling
*08:18.360- 08:19.420* :  that this system
*08:20.040- 08:21.500* :  is not working the way it should.
*08:21.960- 08:23.880* :  One official told me he didn't want to be named
*08:23.900- 08:26.680* :  that the part of the Israeli military
*08:26.680- 08:28.540* :  that people communicate with
*08:28.720- 08:31.200* :  is not, if you like, relaying the message adequately
*08:31.200- 08:33.480* :  so that the people who pass on the message
*08:33.480- 08:35.120* :  to those flying aircraft,
*08:35.580- 08:36.660* :  manning tanks, checkpoints,
*08:36.660- 08:37.520* :  and all the rest of it,
*08:37.960- 08:39.740* :  somebody is coming along the road
*08:39.760- 08:40.720* :  who should not be targeted.
*08:41.400- 08:42.440* :  Somehow there's a breakdown
*08:42.440- 08:44.460* :  and it has happened more than once.
*08:44.860- 08:45.960* :  Of course we've seen apologies
*08:45.960- 08:47.200* :  for this accident,
*08:48.080- 08:49.960* :  this unintended act,
*08:49.960- 08:51.780* :  but there are some who are suggesting
*08:52.420- 08:54.320* :  it may not be entirely accidental
*08:54.320- 08:56.020* :  that these eight convoys are being hit.
*08:56.260- 08:57.500* :  Well, if you work for the UN
*08:57.500- 08:59.320* :  or some of the other aid agencies on the ground
*08:59.340- 09:00.440* :  and you've experienced everything
*09:00.440- 09:02.340* :  they've experienced over the past five months,
*09:02.520- 09:04.060* :  you could be forgiven for feeling
*09:04.060- 09:06.540* :  that somehow Israel does not want
*09:07.060- 09:08.060* :  aid to be distributed,
*09:08.500- 09:09.940* :  especially to Northern Gaza
*09:09.940- 09:12.580* :  where Israel continues to conduct military operations.
*09:12.660- 09:15.580* :  Now we have no way of verifying that,
*09:16.180- 09:18.640* :  but it is clear that there have been enough episodes
*09:19.280- 09:20.340* :  to make people wonder,
*09:20.520- 09:22.060* :  is this just bad luck?
*09:22.060- 09:24.300* :  Is this bad organization?
*09:24.460- 09:26.680* :  Are these trigger happy pilots
*09:26.680- 09:28.000* :  or tank crews or whatever?
*09:28.320- 09:29.700* :  Or is there something else going on?
*09:30.340- 09:32.380* :  Clearly the Israelis are taking this pretty seriously.
*09:33.060- 09:34.600* :  Israel has been criticized for months now
*09:34.600- 09:36.840* :  about its apparent unwillingness
*09:36.940- 09:38.500* :  to look after the interests
*09:38.520- 09:40.260* :  of the civilian population of the Gaza Strip,
*09:40.560- 09:41.880* :  knows that it needs to be seen
*09:41.880- 09:43.600* :  to be doing a better job of that.
*09:43.960- 09:44.940* :  And so it is possible
*09:45.380- 09:47.640* :  that we will see the whole process
*09:47.640- 09:49.140* :  overhauled and examined
*09:49.180- 09:51.500* :  because I think we are reaching a point at which
*09:51.780- 09:53.240* :  many of Israel's closest friends
*09:53.360- 09:56.280* :  are thinking this just cannot go on.
*09:56.560- 09:57.140* :  Paul Adams.
*09:58.360- 10:00.820* :  Tartistan is one of the smaller republics
*10:00.820- 10:03.240* :  within Russia and a relatively remote one,
*10:03.600- 10:06.560* :  sitting almost 1,000 kilometers east of Moscow.
*10:07.180- 10:10.020* :  So it was quite a military achievement for Ukraine
*10:10.060- 10:13.000* :  when it managed to strike a drone factory there
*10:13.000- 10:14.540* :  using one of its own drones.
*10:15.200- 10:18.440* :  But Tartistan is most well known as a producer of oil.
*10:18.460- 10:21.620* :  And it seems that Ukraine also hit a refinery there.
*10:21.860- 10:24.740* :  From Ukraine, here's our correspondent Sarah Reinsford.
*10:25.240- 10:30.460* :  This was the moment when horrified Russians
*10:30.460- 10:33.280* :  watched a large drone shaped like a light aircraft
*10:33.680- 10:35.020* :  coeruing into a building.
*10:37.000- 10:37.740* :  There's an explosion
*10:37.740- 10:39.760* :  than a ball of flames on impact.
*10:40.600- 10:42.860* :  Ukraine's military intelligence service says it
*10:42.860- 10:43.900* :  carried out the attack.
*10:43.900- 10:46.840* :  The deepest it's ever struck inside Russia.
*10:47.620- 10:49.480* :  It says it caused significant damage
*10:49.480- 10:52.200* :  at a facility producing long-range drones.
*10:52.860- 10:54.840* :  Officials in Russia say an accommodation
*10:54.840- 10:55.940* :  block was hit.
*10:56.560- 10:59.460* :  Ukraine targeted a major oil refinery overnight too.
*10:59.960- 11:02.300* :  Although Russia says it's jamming devices locked on
*11:02.300- 11:03.700* :  to that drone before it hit.
*11:04.240- 11:05.540* :  And production continues.
*11:06.340- 11:09.100* :  The latest attack show, Ukraine's expanding capacity
*11:09.100- 11:10.120* :  in drone warfare.
*11:10.740- 11:13.420* :  It is increasingly important as its Western allies
*11:13.420- 11:15.880* :  store on supplying ammunition for the front lines
*11:15.880- 11:18.920* :  and shy away from providing long-range missiles.
*11:19.020- 11:23.060* :  Vladimir Zelensky says Ukraine is stepping up its own production,
*11:23.560- 11:27.440* :  including a far-reaching drones for what he called special tasks.
*11:27.780- 11:30.780* :  Ukraine has been using them to target sites much further
*11:30.780- 11:32.020* :  from its border this year,
*11:32.360- 11:35.240* :  hitting energy facilities that it argues Russia uses
*11:35.240- 11:38.440* :  to fuel and to fund its military operations.
*11:39.240- 11:44.440* :  Sarah Reinsford, now from a real war to a fictional one, sort of.
*11:44.840- 11:48.400* :  The American actress Kirsten Dunn says her new film Civil War
*11:48.900- 11:51.840* :  is intended as a warning about how a domestic conflict
*11:51.840- 11:54.040* :  could break out in the US one day.
*11:54.040- 11:57.780* :  It features a president to some of compared to Donald Trump.
*11:58.380- 12:01.920* :  And it includes footage of riots and more large-scale fighting.
*12:02.380- 12:04.860* :  The film was written and directed by Alex Garland,
*12:04.900- 12:07.620* :  famous for coming out with other dystopian hits
*12:07.620- 12:10.760* :  such as 28 days later at X-Machina.
*12:11.260- 12:12.580* :  He spoke to Charlotte Gallagher,
*12:12.720- 12:14.640* :  along with Kirsten Dunn's about their film,
*12:15.200- 12:17.760* :  and about men getting paid more in Hollywood.
*12:18.120- 12:20.120* :  The United States Army ramps up activity.
*12:20.120- 12:22.520* :  The White House issued warnings to the Western forces
*12:22.520- 12:24.000* :  as well as the Florida Alliance.
*12:24.040- 12:26.880* :  Civil War is about an America divided
*12:27.380- 12:30.380* :  engulfed by violence and led by a president
*12:30.380- 12:32.500* :  who's refusing to leave the White House
*12:32.900- 12:34.680* :  and has torn up the Constitution.
*12:35.440- 12:37.560* :  Kirsten Dunn plays a war photographer
*12:37.840- 12:39.340* :  traumatized by her work.
*12:39.600- 12:42.660* :  I think the movie is very much so warning
*12:43.120- 12:46.300* :  and it leaves people with so much to think about
*12:46.300- 12:48.860* :  if you're in the theater and you really take it in.
*12:48.860- 12:51.400* :  It's a very moving piece about journalists
*12:51.400- 12:54.280* :  and you don't really get that look inside
*12:54.280- 12:56.820* :  in the way that Alex filmed this movie
*12:57.260- 12:59.200* :  felt very realistic while watching this.
*12:59.200- 13:01.580* :  Mr. President, do you regret the use of bear strikes
*13:01.580- 13:02.880* :  against American citizens?
*13:05.340- 13:08.140* :  People have drawn parallels with current politics in America
*13:08.540- 13:10.320* :  and the January 6th insurrection
*13:10.880- 13:12.700* :  that brought chaos to Washington DC.
*13:12.860- 13:16.660* :  But Alex Garland says it's not just relevant to the US.
*13:17.300- 13:18.520* :  The film is set in America.
*13:19.220- 13:22.340* :  This film is about journalists, politics and polarisation
*13:22.400- 13:25.160* :  which leads to extremism and extremist thinking.
*13:25.660- 13:27.580* :  That's happening in America but it's happening
*13:27.580- 13:30.840* :  here for a long time and it's happening across Europe.
*13:31.120- 13:33.780* :  I could list the countries or you could list the countries
*13:34.440- 13:35.460* :  where that would be true.
*13:35.460- 13:35.600* :  Hello.
*13:36.300- 13:38.620* :  The journalists are safe in the capital.
*13:38.920- 13:41.140* :  Every instinct in me says this is death.
*13:41.780- 13:45.360* :  The reporters in this film face immediate dangers to their life
*13:45.360- 13:47.440* :  but Alex says it's also a commentary
*13:47.440- 13:50.100* :  on the dangers facing journalism as a whole.
*13:50.440- 13:53.420* :  Journalism is under attack because you get people saying
*13:53.420- 13:57.020* :  do not trust the BBC and you will be in places
*13:57.620- 14:00.600* :  where you would be attacked and criticised as you know
*14:01.140- 14:05.240* :  for saying the unbiased news reporting organisation
*14:05.240- 14:06.480* :  that you belong to.
*14:07.060- 14:09.560* :  For me at my age there's something very strange about that.
*14:09.920- 14:12.700* :  It's not just strange, it's scary and it's dangerous.
*14:14.120- 14:17.060* :  I can save my life twice and I've never even seen a space.
*14:18.680- 14:20.780* :  Kirsten has been acting since she was a child
*14:20.780- 14:24.540* :  and as a teenager starred in some of the biggest films of the era
*14:24.960- 14:27.420* :  like Spider-Man, Jumanji and Bring It On.
*14:27.420- 14:30.420* :  She has starred him but she didn't have pay equality.
*14:30.920- 14:34.000* :  I definitely grew up in a time with major pay disparity
*14:34.000- 14:37.700* :  between the lead actor and myself even though I had been in
*14:38.160- 14:39.260* :  Bring It On and he hadn't.
*14:39.400- 14:40.900* :  And did you feel in that time you were in a position
*14:40.900- 14:42.400* :  that you couldn't say hang on a second
*14:42.400- 14:43.500* :  why is this person being paid more?
*14:43.560- 14:45.520* :  I was very young and I was 17.
*14:45.520- 14:48.960* :  You know when you're at that age I'm still learning my taste in film.
*14:49.280- 14:50.740* :  I didn't even think to ask.
*14:53.080- 14:54.200* :  She's a terrible queen.
*14:54.960- 14:56.100* :  I'm letting everyone down.
*14:56.660- 14:58.120* :  I've been my greatest unhappiness.
*14:58.980- 15:03.200* :  Marianne Tornatch was another of Kirsten's lavish big budget films
*15:03.840- 15:05.520* :  but wasn't welcomed by the critics.
*15:05.520- 15:08.640* :  The people that were watching that movie were my age.
*15:08.800- 15:09.820* :  They weren't movie reviewers.
*15:09.820- 15:11.720* :  Movie reviewers were old men.
*15:11.980- 15:14.860* :  The people that enjoy Marie Antoinette have now grown up
*15:14.900- 15:16.160* :  and they're like we loved this movie
*15:16.160- 15:18.100* :  but they weren't the people that were writing reviews.
*15:18.380- 15:21.420* :  We grow up in a world where it's mankind, man made,
*15:21.660- 15:23.960* :  man this, man that, that's how we grew up.
*15:24.020- 15:26.000* :  I think that times have changed.
*15:26.060- 15:31.460* :  Hopefully the way I carve my path will help other, you know,
*15:31.960- 15:32.760* :  actresses.
*15:36.480- 15:39.180* :  Kirsten Dunn, sending that report by Charlotte Gallagher.
*15:40.080- 15:42.280* :  The first man on the moon is Old Hat.
*15:42.280- 15:44.580* :  Since then we've had the first lunar vehicle
*15:45.180- 15:47.640* :  along with a variety of automatic probes
*15:47.640- 15:50.540* :  some of which landed successfully, others less so.
*15:50.760- 15:54.780* :  But now NASA has unveiled plans to grow the first crops on the moon.
*15:55.220- 15:59.840* :  The project is called Luna FX on agricultural flora or leaf.
*15:59.840- 16:01.760* :  The crops will be grown for food,
*16:02.340- 16:04.460* :  for cleaning air and purifying water.
*16:04.880- 16:08.340* :  Martha Carney has been finding out how from Christine Escobar
*16:08.800- 16:12.300* :  who holds the post of Space Habitat Systems Engineer.
*16:12.800- 16:16.520* :  The leaf experiment is essentially a growth chamber
*16:16.760- 16:20.740* :  much like you would have an indoor farm on earth
*16:20.860- 16:23.920* :  that provides the plants with everything that they need to live.
*16:24.220- 16:26.120* :  But the challenge with this growth chamber
*16:26.320- 16:28.160* :  and especially on the surface of the moon
*16:28.500- 16:31.960* :  is that the instrument will also protect them
*16:31.960- 16:33.840* :  from the harsh conditions of space
*16:34.260- 16:37.540* :  as well as be able to operate in reduced gravity.
*16:37.540- 16:44.500* :  So what we hope to learn is about how the plants grow,
*16:44.700- 16:50.000* :  how they photosynthesize, how the lunar environment might affect their color and shape
*16:50.000- 16:55.720* :  and really how they respond to stress in the environment that is found on the moon.
*16:55.720- 17:00.220* :  Things like elevated radiation and reduced gravity
*17:00.720- 17:01.960* :  and extreme temperatures.
*17:02.460- 17:06.760* :  And have you decided what kinds of crops that you might be looking at?
*17:06.960- 17:10.120* :  Yes, so we're really excited. We've chosen three different varieties.
*17:10.980- 17:16.120* :  One is called wolfia, but you might know it as duckweed or water lentils.
*17:16.620- 17:18.780* :  Another crop is called brassica rappa,
*17:18.780- 17:23.380* :  which are plants that are similar or related to turnips.
*17:23.620- 17:26.800* :  And a third crop is called a rabidopsis or stale crest.
*17:26.840- 17:29.520* :  And they have been studied before in space.
*17:29.520- 17:33.380* :  So we have a lot of data to compare to, not on the moon, of course,
*17:33.380- 17:35.860* :  but in earth orbit, these plants have been grown.
*17:36.420- 17:39.740* :  But it's also two of them are really nutritious and edible,
*17:39.740- 17:43.240* :  so they're really representative of potential space crops that one might eat.
*17:43.880- 17:46.400* :  Do you think the astronauts are going to be quite as excited
*17:46.400- 17:48.720* :  about the prospect of eating lots of duckweed?
*17:49.020- 17:53.080* :  Oh, I think the astronauts are going to be quite excited about the prospect
*17:53.080- 17:56.520* :  of eating any plants and fresh food in general.
*17:56.520- 18:00.500* :  Fresh food is always very welcome for an astronaut crew
*18:01.100- 18:06.440* :  as a break from the mundane diet of dehydrated pre-packaged meals.
*18:06.680- 18:08.700* :  That's the choice I can understand that.
*18:08.840- 18:12.560* :  Plants are a little interesting because it's not something we're very familiar with
*18:12.560- 18:15.480* :  as a standard food or vegetable that we might eat,
*18:15.480- 18:17.920* :  but they're actually really commonly eaten in Asian countries.
*18:18.460- 18:21.220* :  And actually tasty and just incredibly nutritious.
*18:21.220- 18:23.440* :  So we see these plants as a potential supplement,
*18:23.440- 18:26.860* :  like maybe on a salad or in a soup.
*18:27.440- 18:30.140* :  Christine Escobar talking there to Martha Karney.
*18:33.300- 18:35.220* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast?
*18:35.840- 18:39.180* :  How is it possible that it fell to the world to get hold of a gun
*18:39.180- 18:42.960* :  and how is it possible that he ended up in a classroom with a gun?
*18:43.400- 18:46.560* :  Finland is in shock following a school shooting by a child
*18:46.560- 18:49.280* :  that left one pupil dead and several wounded.
*18:56.900- 19:00.040* :  It's not often we report on a phone call having taken place,
*19:00.680- 19:03.620* :  but this one did last an hour and 45 minutes,
*19:04.060- 19:06.860* :  and it was a call between the US President Joe Biden
*19:07.320- 19:09.460* :  and his Chinese opposite number Xi Jinping.
*19:09.460- 19:13.060* :  It came just as people have suggested there could be a thought
*19:13.060- 19:14.900* :  in relations between the two countries,
*19:15.620- 19:18.140* :  although they remain bitterly divided on trade
*19:18.660- 19:21.980* :  and on China's stated intention to reunify with Taiwan
*19:21.980- 19:23.640* :  by force if necessary.
*19:24.260- 19:26.540* :  From Washington, here's our State Department correspondent,
*19:26.540- 19:27.680* :  Tom Bateman.
*19:28.200- 19:30.540* :  The phone call lasted an hour and 45 minutes,
*19:30.540- 19:34.500* :  with the US and China trying to reestablish channels of communication
*19:34.500- 19:38.580* :  after ties sank to their lowest levels in decades in recent years.
*19:39.260- 19:40.720* :  With regional tensions rising,
*19:40.720- 19:44.740* :  the White House says President Biden emphasized the need to maintain stability
*19:44.740- 19:47.800* :  in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.
*19:48.080- 19:51.060* :  A nod to the fact that Washington has pledged to defend allies
*19:51.060- 19:53.940* :  who feel threatened by an increasingly assertive China.
*19:54.640- 19:57.300* :  On trade relations, President Xi warned Mr Biden
*19:57.300- 20:00.280* :  the US was not de-risking, but creating risks
*20:00.780- 20:03.040* :  by suppressing Beijing's technology development
*20:03.040- 20:05.560* :  and adding new entities to the sanctions list.
*20:06.160- 20:08.760* :  Chinese state media said President Xi told Mr Biden
*20:08.760- 20:10.660* :  that ties were beginning to stabilize,
*20:10.660- 20:14.020* :  but warned that they could slide into conflict or confrontation.
*20:14.800- 20:17.580* :  Both sides have reasons now to pursue more dialogue
*20:17.580- 20:19.220* :  and try to avert friction,
*20:19.820- 20:22.360* :  but the long-term relations between these two rival
*20:22.360- 20:24.140* :  but interdependent powers
*20:24.140- 20:28.320* :  is still set to shape global relations for the coming decades.
*20:29.000- 20:32.780* :  Tom Bateman, there had been warnings across Finland
*20:32.780- 20:35.960* :  in recent years schools have received a growing number of threats
*20:35.960- 20:38.120* :  that shootings were going to take place,
*20:38.860- 20:40.940* :  that actual shootings are still rare,
*20:41.500- 20:42.820* :  which means it came as a shock
*20:42.820- 20:44.900* :  when a 12-year-old child was killed
*20:45.360- 20:47.940* :  after one of his classmates opened fire to others
*20:47.940- 20:48.940* :  was seriously injured.
*20:49.420- 20:52.160* :  Ian Hanifa, pupil at the school, described what happened.
*20:52.780- 20:55.660* :  When I was in the class, we were given permission to go out,
*20:56.080- 20:59.300* :  but then suddenly the teacher said us to come back to the class
*20:59.540- 21:01.360* :  and then we got the instructions to sit
*21:01.360- 21:03.480* :  and do everything, like the emergency things.
*21:03.680- 21:06.740* :  I think I heard one or two gunshots,
*21:06.740- 21:09.240* :  but I'm not sure. It's a little traumatizing.
*21:09.660- 21:11.680* :  The police investigation is still ongoing,
*21:12.240- 21:14.480* :  but for the latest details, I spoke to our reporter
*21:14.480- 21:16.100* :  in Finland, Erica Benke.
*21:16.660- 21:19.540* :  We know that the suspect, a 12-year-old boy,
*21:19.960- 21:22.540* :  ran away from the scene after the shooting
*21:22.540- 21:27.580* :  and police detained him only about three kilometers away from the school.
*21:28.040- 21:31.260* :  He still had the handgun in his possession,
*21:31.300- 21:35.660* :  but he calmly handed it over to the policemen who found him.
*21:35.980- 21:39.600* :  Politicians say the entire country is in shock
*21:39.740- 21:41.440* :  and in mourning, of course.
*21:41.660- 21:46.580* :  People are so shocked because of the age of the victims
*21:46.580- 21:48.920* :  and the suspected shooter.
*21:49.440- 21:51.740* :  So they are all 12 years old.
*21:51.940- 21:55.960* :  It seems that this boy took a weapon from some member of his family.
*21:56.440- 21:59.260* :  Finland's a country with relaxed laws about guns,
*21:59.260- 22:01.360* :  and it's quite easy to own one, isn't it?
*22:02.100- 22:06.520* :  Well, gun laws were actually tightened in 2010
*22:07.060- 22:10.020* :  after two previous cases of school shootings
*22:10.020- 22:15.640* :  that have similarly shocked the nation in 2007 and 2008.
*22:16.140- 22:17.940* :  There are a lot of guns around,
*22:17.940- 22:21.520* :  but to own one, you need to have a license
*22:21.520- 22:23.800* :  and a number of background checks
*22:23.800- 22:25.320* :  that the police will do.
*22:25.320- 22:28.060* :  They obviously check your criminal record.
*22:28.800- 22:32.940* :  You have to be 18, which is probably a little younger
*22:32.940- 22:34.460* :  than in many other countries.
*22:35.020- 22:38.620* :  And even 15-year-olds can acquire a license
*22:38.620- 22:41.160* :  to use somebody else's gun.
*22:41.380- 22:45.040* :  So one reason for that is that hunting is very popular here
*22:45.500- 22:49.680* :  and also target shooting, sports shooting is quite popular.
*22:50.020- 22:52.380* :  It's ironic, isn't it, that just a short while ago,
*22:52.380- 22:56.500* :  the Finnish government, I think, was calling for there to be more gun ownership,
*22:56.500- 22:59.180* :  more training, certainly, for people on how to use guns
*22:59.180- 23:02.060* :  because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*23:02.520- 23:05.180* :  Exactly. So there was a call just a few weeks ago
*23:05.180- 23:09.880* :  by the Finnish government to increase the number of shooting ranges in Finland
*23:09.880- 23:12.660* :  to boost interest in national defence.
*23:13.920- 23:18.040* :  Despite that effort, do you think this latest incident could lead to calls
*23:18.040- 23:20.460* :  for title laws on gun ownership?
*23:20.800- 23:22.900* :  Yeah, so that was the question that reporters
*23:22.900- 23:25.500* :  at today's press conference were asking,
*23:25.500- 23:29.080* :  how is it possible that a 12-year-old could get hold of a gun
*23:29.080- 23:32.860* :  and how is it possible that he ended up in a classroom with a gun?
*23:33.280- 23:36.520* :  Prime Minister Patrick Orbo already today was talking about the need
*23:36.520- 23:40.760* :  to look at increased or improved healthcare services for children.
*23:41.120- 23:42.320* :  Erica Benke in Finland.
*23:43.320- 23:45.560* :  A large trial has started here in the UK
*23:46.180- 23:50.360* :  to try and understand whether taking anti-depressants following a brain injury
*23:50.360- 23:54.480* :  could prevent severe depression which can happen after a blow to the brain,
*23:54.480- 23:55.620* :  even if it's mild.
*23:55.620- 23:59.300* :  The lead researcher, Professor Khalida Ismail from King's College London,
*23:59.820- 24:03.500* :  explained to Nurena McGuffin why the study was so important.
*24:03.980- 24:07.620* :  Depression is already common in the general population, it's about 5%,
*24:07.620- 24:09.400* :  and in people who have had a head injury,
*24:09.560- 24:11.380* :  even those who have had a smaller head injury,
*24:11.380- 24:13.780* :  the rates increase to 50%.
*24:13.780- 24:14.360* :  50?
*24:14.700- 24:17.700* :  That's right, it's a very large 10-fold increase risk,
*24:17.700- 24:23.540* :  so it seems to make sense for the NHS and for the person who has the head injury
*24:23.580- 24:27.240* :  to try and prevent the depression and other related symptoms
*24:27.840- 24:29.540* :  from happening in the first place.
*24:30.240- 24:32.360* :  So with the trial, what are you planning on doing?
*24:32.720- 24:35.220* :  So this trial is what we call, technically,
*24:35.220- 24:38.600* :  a large, randomized, controlled trial.
*24:39.260- 24:42.180* :  There's an equal chance dictated by the computer
*24:42.500- 24:45.920* :  of being allocated to the experimental treatment,
*24:45.920- 24:48.120* :  which is an anti-depressant called surgery,
*24:48.120- 24:50.300* :  or an inactive placebo.
*24:50.660- 24:52.380* :  They look identical to each other.
*24:52.760- 24:54.880* :  The patients are randomized to one of the two groups,
*24:54.880- 24:59.120* :  and they are being asked to take this medication for 12 months
*24:59.160- 25:02.540* :  as soon after the head injury has taken place.
*25:02.880- 25:04.520* :  So you'll be looking for volunteers for this?
*25:04.520- 25:05.060* :  That's right.
*25:05.060- 25:08.480* :  We are inviting patients presenting an A&E
*25:08.880- 25:12.460* :  or have just been admitted to a trauma ward with a head injury,
*25:12.880- 25:16.700* :  and asking if they're interested in participating in order to test
*25:16.700- 25:20.520* :  if we can actually prevent depression from happening in the first place.
*25:21.000- 25:24.260* :  Why would depression happen at such a potentially high rate
*25:24.440- 25:26.140* :  after a head collision?
*25:26.560- 25:28.140* :  Because there's been trauma to the brain.
*25:28.460- 25:31.040* :  The brain is where depression happens.
*25:31.260- 25:35.160* :  There has been a biological insults to brain cells.
*25:35.700- 25:38.880* :  We don't fully know exactly the mechanisms
*25:38.880- 25:42.060* :  because this is still a very new area of research
*25:42.060- 25:45.080* :  in terms of understanding biologically why people get depression.
*25:45.080- 25:50.480* :  But the theory is there is probably some activation of inflammation
*25:50.480- 25:53.160* :  as a result of the head injury in the brain,
*25:53.540- 25:56.880* :  and that this then disrupts the normal pathways
*25:56.880- 25:58.480* :  that control our mood.
*25:58.560- 26:00.820* :  It's so interesting that you're talking about it.
*26:00.820- 26:03.120* :  It's a biological insult as opposed to,
*26:03.120- 26:05.680* :  I suppose, some people might think of depression as sometimes
*26:05.680- 26:10.500* :  outward environmental factor grief, traumatic life event,
*26:10.520- 26:13.700* :  as opposed to an actual traumatic knock to the brain.
*26:14.000- 26:17.440* :  Well, exactly, and I perhaps that explains why there's such a massive increase
*26:17.560- 26:21.040* :  in the risk of depression from 5% to the general public
*26:21.040- 26:23.840* :  to 50% in people with head injury.
*26:24.460- 26:27.840* :  And although we can't always see all the damage on the head scans,
*26:28.000- 26:31.820* :  it may be that there've been very small micro tears, for instance,
*26:32.060- 26:35.980* :  that may be contributing to activating the inflammation.
*26:36.460- 26:40.840* :  Do you think people who have had a traumatic brain injury
*26:40.840- 26:44.940* :  and their loved ones know about the potential for depression
*26:45.280- 26:46.180* :  after the collision?
*26:46.480- 26:49.800* :  No, it's not very well explained to patients.
*26:49.800- 26:51.200* :  It might be by chance.
*26:51.780- 26:54.400* :  I remember there's one patient we were talking to
*26:54.660- 26:56.220* :  as part of our preparation.
*26:56.920- 26:59.700* :  And he had gone into a coma following a very severe
*27:00.140- 27:01.180* :  road traffic accident.
*27:01.820- 27:05.860* :  And he had said that if somebody had told me that an antidepressant
*27:05.860- 27:08.580* :  would have helped my rehabilitation when I woke up,
*27:08.700- 27:11.880* :  I would have wanted the nurses and doctors to have given it to me
*27:11.880- 27:15.600* :  in my tubes so that I had the best chance when I woke up.
*27:15.740- 27:17.920* :  And that really struck in my mind,
*27:17.940- 27:20.180* :  as the reason why this study is important.
*27:20.840- 27:23.440* :  Professor Khalida is mailed from King's College, London,
*27:24.140- 27:25.400* :  speaking to Nula McGovern.
*27:26.380- 27:28.100* :  The French actress is a value pair.
*27:28.100- 27:30.960* :  Has played some pretty severe characters in her time.
*27:31.060- 27:34.000* :  A psychopathic piano teacher, a murderous servant,
*27:34.540- 27:36.320* :  had a fetchful widow among others.
*27:36.720- 27:40.300* :  Now she's been similarly cast in a new French production of the play
*27:40.300- 27:42.460* :  Baranise, taking the role of a queen,
*27:42.520- 27:46.120* :  furious when her lover chooses to marry someone else.
*27:46.640- 27:49.460* :  Now given what would seem to be this rather tough image,
*27:50.040- 27:53.000* :  it must have taken some nerve for members of the audience
*27:53.000- 27:54.960* :  to start heckling the French star.
*27:55.580- 27:58.260* :  But they did have a reason, as Stephanie Prentice explains.
*28:03.540- 28:07.500* :  When the multi-award winning actress Isabelle Uppair appears on stage,
*28:07.500- 28:13.580* :  fans tend to get excited, expecting intrigue, passion and drama.
*28:14.260- 28:17.800* :  But usually from the performance, not the audience.
*28:18.620- 28:22.320* :  That's all changed in Paris during a retelling of Baranise,
*28:22.600- 28:26.820* :  a five-act tragedy by the great 17th-century dramatist, Racine.
*28:27.300- 28:31.160* :  The theatre was fully booked and director Romeo Castellucci's
*28:31.160- 28:34.800* :  pair-down production, if a little unusual, well received.
*28:35.540- 28:39.980* :  But things took a turn when a washing machine was wheeled onto the stage.
*28:40.640- 28:41.860* :  It caused some confusion,
*28:42.280- 28:44.900* :  particularly when Miss Uppair spoke to it.
*28:45.840- 28:48.840* :  But not as much as the latter half of the performance,
*28:48.840- 28:52.500* :  which has been described by some as intentionally provocative.
*28:53.280- 28:58.580* :  Alban Bartelemey is a journalist at the French newspaper La Figaro and was there.
*28:59.160- 29:04.680* :  Suddenly after like one hour of playing, Isabelle Uppair starts stuttering on stage.
*29:05.400- 29:08.540* :  Well, again, it was supposed to be tragic, I guess.
*29:08.620- 29:13.340* :  But then a man in the audience just in front of me actually starts yelling at her.
*29:13.580- 29:16.960* :  He said, we do not understand what you're saying, Isabelle.
*29:17.040- 29:21.720* :  And a couple of minutes later, another guy starts laughing at her.
*29:22.060- 29:28.000* :  Whether Miss Uppair was audible seems especially pertinent as she had the only speaking role.
*29:28.500- 29:32.200* :  At the end of the play, some people in the audience started Boeing,
*29:32.640- 29:36.480* :  but this is Isabelle Uppair, one of the most famous French actress.
*29:37.260- 29:39.580* :  So what happens was not common at all.
*29:39.840- 29:43.120* :  At the end of the play, some people started to insult each other,
*29:43.460- 29:47.140* :  inside each other. They almost started to fight physically.
*29:47.920- 29:51.060* :  Some have said this reaction may have been the director's intention
*29:51.660- 29:54.920* :  and could have been a device to highlight Miss Uppair's range.
*29:55.680- 29:59.240* :  Now, as the play prepares to move to a broader European run,
*29:59.240- 30:03.280* :  the incident has sparked a debate over audience behavior in theaters,
*30:03.820- 30:07.400* :  with some critics arguing respectful silence is necessary,
*30:08.140- 30:13.760* :  others that are more riotous approach as seen in theaters up until the 19th century has a place.
*30:14.680- 30:19.000* :  As for the star herself, she said she wasn't surprised by strong reactions,
*30:19.640- 30:24.080* :  but in Signature Style added, we have gone up a level with an actress being addressed
*30:24.080- 30:25.800* :  directly during a performance.
*30:26.520- 30:29.900* :  That report from the always clearly audible Stephanie Prentice.
*30:30.660- 30:35.220* :  Now, what does the man responsible for Louis Vuitton-Hambags-Berna Arno
*30:35.700- 30:38.720* :  have in common with Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg?
*30:38.720- 30:44.320* :  The answer is, they were all named in the latest Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.
*30:44.320- 30:49.580* :  The list provides, of course, an annual excuse for the rest of us either to gaze in admiration,
*30:49.580- 30:53.780* :  this roll call of the rich, or alternatively perhaps to Shudder,
*30:53.780- 30:57.220* :  or the thought of so much money in the hands of so few people.
*30:57.780- 31:02.140* :  This year, though, the Forbes list does include nearly 3,000 billionaires,
*31:02.140- 31:03.460* :  a record-breaking number.
*31:04.000- 31:07.300* :  According to the man who compiled the list, chase Peterson with horn.
*31:07.760- 31:12.720* :  There's more than ever and the richer than ever worth 14.2 trillion dollars,
*31:12.720- 31:15.440* :  two trillion dollars more than last year.
*31:15.680- 31:17.500* :  Stock markets around the world are up.
*31:17.840- 31:20.860* :  These people are some of the biggest beneficiaries.
*31:21.520- 31:23.560* :  Tech stocks are going through the roof.
*31:23.560- 31:26.500* :  There's a ton of enthusiasm for AI.
*31:26.500- 31:30.220* :  We've seen a lot of new billionaires come into the ranks this year
*31:30.220- 31:33.820* :  who have AI companies or who are using AI in their business,
*31:33.820- 31:39.100* :  but it's also really boosted the values of a lot of traditional tech billionaires,
*31:39.460- 31:41.080* :  people like Mark Zuckerberg as well.
*31:41.760- 31:44.980* :  Also, on the list is the world's biggest pop star Taylor Swift,
*31:45.660- 31:48.360* :  and it's all down to dominating streaming services,
*31:48.780- 31:52.260* :  and, of course, selling out concerts around the world as our culture reporter,
*31:52.740- 31:53.660* :  Nuananji reports.
*31:56.460- 32:02.620* :  Taylor Swift dominated pop music in 2023.
*32:02.700- 32:06.040* :  Now Forbes says she also became a billionaire last year,
*32:06.500- 32:09.940* :  thanks to the value of her music catalog and her earnings from her era's tool.
*32:13.300- 32:16.560* :  The magazine says she is the first musician to hit the 10-figure mark,
*32:16.980- 32:18.820* :  solely based on her songs and performances.
*32:22.880- 32:25.680* :  Swift released the best-selling vinyl LP of last year,
*32:26.200- 32:29.080* :  a re-recording of her decade-old album, 1989,
*32:29.280- 32:30.900* :  containing hits like Shake It Off.
*32:33.260- 32:36.380* :  Her era's tool has also broken box office records,
*32:36.380- 32:41.540* :  spawned a hit's movie, and even provoked an inquiry into ticket masters sales practices.
*32:42.960- 32:44.880* :  This year, she's gone from strength to strength.
*32:45.200- 32:46.780* :  She's told the show at the Grammy Awards,
*32:46.920- 32:50.740* :  becoming the first performer to win the prize for album of the year, four times.
*32:56.000- 32:58.720* :  Swift's success is not just confined to the world of music.
*32:58.780- 33:03.560* :  Her mere presence at American Football Games to watch her boyfriend Traverse Kelsey
*33:04.220- 33:06.620* :  has been credited with raising NFL viewing figures.
*33:12.180- 33:16.640* :  Forbes said there were a record 2781 billionaires on its list,
*33:16.960- 33:18.940* :  141 more than last year.
*33:19.940- 33:24.820* :  Other newcomers include Sam Ultman, creator of the AI chatbot chat GPT,
*33:25.480- 33:29.420* :  while the founder of the French luxury goods firm, LVMage, Bernard Arnold,
*33:29.420- 33:34.540* :  and his family topped the charts with an estimated fortune of $233 billion.
*33:39.960- 33:43.940* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*33:44.520- 33:48.220* :  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and the producer was Emma Joseph.
*33:48.220- 33:52.540* :  The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Paul Moss and until next time, goodbye.
*34:00.840- 34:04.960* :  Honey, why are you packing a suit with swim trunks and sunscreen?
