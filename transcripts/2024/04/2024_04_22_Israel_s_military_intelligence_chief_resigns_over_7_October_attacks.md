*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?

*01:09.800- 01:13.600* :  I'm Janet Gillil and at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 22nd of April,
*01:13.840- 01:14.940* :  these are our main stories.
*01:15.600- 01:18.560* :  The head of Israeli military intelligence has resigned.
*01:18.560- 01:23.960* :  The first senior Israeli figure to step down over the Hamas attacks on October the 7th.
*01:24.520- 01:30.160* :  The president of Ecuador has won a referendum for tougher security measures to combat violent drugs gangs.
*01:30.940- 01:37.280* :  Filipino and US troops begin joint military exercises at a time of tensions between the Philippines and China.
*01:39.740- 01:40.600* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:40.800- 01:47.200* :  and they never found the body because there used to be a lot of cannibals for real in that part of the guinea.
*01:48.040- 01:53.140* :  We hear how President Biden's latest gaff has offended people in Papua New Guinea.
*01:57.700- 01:58.840* :  As we record this podcast,
*01:58.840- 02:05.400* :  a court in New York is due to start hearing opening arguments in the unprecedented criminal trial of Donald Trump.
*02:05.960- 02:09.900* :  A jury will hear initial evidence from prosecutors and defense lawyers,
*02:10.320- 02:15.900* :  and will bring you the outcome of that first day of the trial in our next edition of the Global News Podcast.
*02:16.580- 02:18.760* :  But for this edition, we start in Israel,
*02:19.040- 02:24.180* :  where the head of military intelligence has resigned over his role in failing to stop the Hamas attacks
*02:24.180- 02:25.440* :  on October the 7th.
*02:26.000- 02:31.760* :  Major General Aharon Haliva is the highest-ranking Israeli official to step down over the attacks
*02:32.200- 02:34.800* :  in which well over a thousand people were killed.
*02:35.420- 02:39.320* :  Israel's opposition leader Yaya Lapid said his resignation was justified,
*02:39.320- 02:43.040* :  and the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should follow suit.
*02:44.000- 02:49.660* :  In Gaza itself, the Hamas authorities say they've now retrieved around 200 bodies from a mass grave
*02:49.660- 02:53.240* :  at a hospital where they was heavy fighting with Israeli forces.
*02:54.000- 02:56.720* :  I spoke to our Middle East correspondent, Eroland Nell, in Jerusalem.
*02:56.720- 03:00.420* :  I started off by asking her about the intelligence chief's resignation.
*03:01.080- 03:02.980* :  This is a high-profile resignation.
*03:03.000- 03:06.560* :  The first general of the army's general staff to leave his position
*03:06.980- 03:09.640* :  due to the failures that led to the 7th of October attack.
*03:09.640- 03:14.160* :  And in the week after Hamas government broke into southern Israel,
*03:14.160- 03:18.720* :  we did have Major General Aharon Haliva publicly taking responsibility
*03:19.360- 03:21.560* :  as the head of Israeli military intelligence.
*03:21.620- 03:26.200* :  And he has now six months on, written in his resignation letter,
*03:26.580- 03:29.860* :  that the intelligence division did not live up to the task we were entrusted with.
*03:30.260- 03:34.660* :  And notably, he also called for the establishment of a state investigative committee,
*03:34.660- 03:38.840* :  which he said should look in depth and look at all the different factors and circumstances
*03:38.840- 03:41.060* :  that led to those difficult events.
*03:41.140- 03:43.360* :  Could there be more resignations to follow?
*03:44.000- 03:47.540* :  I mean, certainly it's anticipated that there will be resignations,
*03:47.840- 03:50.160* :  perhaps not always so high-profile,
*03:50.160- 03:56.700* :  but really the stance has been that Israel went very quickly into its response to those attacks,
*03:56.700- 04:00.500* :  the war in Gaza that has rage for the past six months.
*04:01.000- 04:04.820* :  And so really many were expecting after the war was over
*04:04.820- 04:10.180* :  to have more of a focus on military, potentially also political resignations
*04:10.640- 04:12.160* :  with different fingers being permitted,
*04:12.580- 04:13.940* :  particularly by anti-government protesters,
*04:14.360- 04:19.920* :  that those they think should be held to account for those awful events of six months ago.
*04:19.920- 04:23.820* :  And for different failures that allowed them to take place.
*04:24.200- 04:28.320* :  And meanwhile, in Gaza, there's this mass grave that's been discovered
*04:28.820- 04:32.880* :  in the courtyard of Al-Nasa Hospital in Karnunis in central Gaza.
*04:33.360- 04:34.620* :  What more can you tell us about that?
*04:35.220- 04:38.340* :  So Israel's military pulled its forces out of Karnunis,
*04:38.560- 04:40.620* :  the biggest city in the south of the Gaza Strip,
*04:40.620- 04:43.560* :  which has been so much the focus of its offensive there,
*04:44.040- 04:44.800* :  earlier this month.
*04:45.120- 04:48.340* :  And since then, we've had locals, we've had rescued staff going back,
*04:48.340- 04:52.020* :  trying to find out what happened to some 2,000 people still missing,
*04:52.020- 04:54.540* :  most of them presumed to be dead under the rubble.
*04:54.860- 04:57.020* :  And a lot of focus has been on the Nasa Hospital,
*04:57.020- 05:01.740* :  where the Israeli military said it carried out a precise and limited operation there
*05:02.120- 05:04.480* :  against Hamas Gumman, it said, we're using the site.
*05:04.880- 05:09.360* :  And we had a large evacuation at the time of some of the displaced people
*05:09.360- 05:11.140* :  and medics and patients that were there.
*05:11.540- 05:16.080* :  But now, these reports of about another 50 bodies found a day ago
*05:16.080- 05:20.560* :  in a mass grave, bringing close to 200 bodies in the last few days,
*05:20.560- 05:22.660* :  the number that has been found there,
*05:22.920- 05:25.080* :  and local people trying to identify those,
*05:25.080- 05:27.420* :  the Israeli military, asked about this,
*05:27.420- 05:28.800* :  and said it's checking the reports.
*05:29.780- 05:31.240* :  Yolanda Nell, in Jerusalem.
*05:32.040- 05:35.400* :  It's the resounding victory for Ecuador's president in his battle
*05:35.400- 05:38.180* :  against the drugs gangs that have terrorized his country.
*05:38.640- 05:42.340* :  Voters have backed Danubeau's plans to strengthen security,
*05:42.940- 05:45.160* :  which include allowing the military to patrol streets,
*05:45.160- 05:48.520* :  harsher jail terms, and the extradition of wanted criminals.
*05:49.260- 05:50.860* :  Even as voting was taking place,
*05:50.920- 05:53.600* :  the authorities reported the death of a prison director.
*05:54.300- 05:57.460* :  The violence in Ecuador made international headlines in January
*05:57.460- 06:00.040* :  when Gumman stormed a live television broadcast
*06:00.700- 06:04.600* :  at the same time as dozens of prison guards were being taken hostage.
*06:05.240- 06:06.640* :  With more from the Capitol Keto,
*06:06.860- 06:09.380* :  here's our South America correspondent, Ioni Wells.
*06:12.840- 06:15.900* :  The center of Keto is full of lively jovial scenes,
*06:16.020- 06:18.740* :  but people here tell me they're now constantly looking
*06:18.740- 06:20.100* :  over their shoulders in fear.
*06:20.620- 06:23.460* :  Homicides, kidnappings, and robberies have soared in Ecuador
*06:23.820- 06:26.560* :  as the influence of violent criminal gangs has erupted.
*06:29.720- 06:32.140* :  We're just heading into a use center now in a suburb of Keto.
*06:32.440- 06:34.380* :  There's a boxing ring, which sometimes boxing
*06:34.400- 06:36.320* :  lots of people spectating on the sidelines.
*06:36.980- 06:39.200* :  We're here to meet Carmen, who works here.
*06:39.460- 06:42.240* :  Her brother, Darwin, was killed two years ago
*06:42.240- 06:45.500* :  when he was 19 years old by a gang member who just wanted money.
*06:47.760- 06:50.280* :  They gang threatened us at our house,
*06:50.780- 06:52.180* :  throwing stones at us,
*06:52.660- 06:55.140* :  because the murder occurred next to my son.
*06:55.600- 06:58.560* :  They said, if the gang member goes to the prison,
*06:59.000- 07:01.400* :  my son would be the next person to die.
*07:01.780- 07:05.240* :  I think militarizing the country is not the solution.
*07:05.800- 07:09.280* :  Instead of investing that, they should invest in the youth.
*07:11.700- 07:14.300* :  A cocaine dealer I spoke to, known as El Gato,
*07:14.300- 07:16.300* :  the cat, illustrates her point.
*07:16.300- 07:19.100* :  He didn't want to be identified, so we've changed his voice.
*07:21.300- 07:24.660* :  I started selling and smoking when I was 14 years old.
*07:24.920- 07:26.400* :  We went through financial problems.
*07:26.400- 07:29.560* :  My mother was always working and never there for me.
*07:30.360- 07:32.680* :  I was alone on the house crying and screaming for my mom.
*07:33.460- 07:36.600* :  Then I met my friends, bad friends, who introduced me to drugs.
*07:37.020- 07:39.120* :  I believed that the country's economic crisis
*07:39.120- 07:40.540* :  is what led to so much crime.
*07:41.020- 07:43.880* :  Surprisingly, he was in favor of tighter security measures,
*07:44.320- 07:45.700* :  saying he'd like to leave this life
*07:45.840- 07:47.760* :  if only beating addiction felt possible.
*07:51.140- 07:54.140* :  This vote came after a state of emergency was called in January
*07:54.140- 07:56.580* :  when armed gunmen stormed a TV station,
*07:56.940- 07:58.380* :  a gang leader escaped from prison,
*07:58.380- 08:01.360* :  and there was a wave of prison riots and politicians murdered.
*08:01.680- 08:03.880* :  The military were brought in to control the situation.
*08:05.940- 08:09.100* :  The president hopes this vote gives him a mandate for this to continue.
*08:10.920- 08:12.240* :  We need security.
*08:12.240- 08:15.240* :  Get rid of narcotraficking and criminality
*08:15.780- 08:17.980* :  to bring peace to this country.
*08:20.260- 08:22.020* :  In my opinion, it's unnecessary.
*08:22.520- 08:23.820* :  They say we have no money,
*08:24.180- 08:26.600* :  but they are spending money badly with this vote.
*08:29.060- 08:31.440* :  While some hope tighter security will give them the right
*08:31.440- 08:33.120* :  to live their lives free of fear,
*08:33.480- 08:35.580* :  others fear it could lead to abuses of their rights.
*08:37.780- 08:39.760* :  Carlos Mendes was leaving work one day
*08:39.760- 08:43.120* :  when police carrying out a raid nearby beat him up arbitrarily.
*08:43.120- 08:45.100* :  His father said they still live in fear.
*08:46.580- 08:49.540* :  It is a trauma that we have been experiencing up until now.
*08:50.180- 08:51.920* :  We have fear that this could happen again.
*08:52.600- 08:56.100* :  Our concern now is there could be more soldiers, more controls,
*08:56.600- 08:58.180* :  and that is where the abuses are right.
*09:00.420- 09:02.260* :  There's one thing everyone here agrees on.
*09:02.260- 09:07.160* :  They all want Ecuador to return to the relatively peaceful touristy country it once was.
*09:08.040- 09:10.980* :  The test for the government is if these measures can achieve that.
*09:13.040- 09:14.700* :  That report by Ioni Wells.
*09:15.500- 09:18.420* :  The British Prime Minister, Issue Nax, says the first flights
*09:18.420- 09:22.580* :  carrying asylum seekers to Rwanda will leave in 10 to 12 weeks,
*09:23.180- 09:25.220* :  despite strong disagreements in Parliament,
*09:25.220- 09:28.820* :  which have held up a bill the government regards as a flagship policy
*09:28.820- 09:31.620* :  in its efforts to reduce illegal immigration.
*09:32.360- 09:34.760* :  Mrs. Nax said an airfield was on standby
*09:34.760- 09:36.840* :  and commercial charter planes booked.
*09:37.280- 09:39.520* :  The bill to process migrants in Rwanda,
*09:39.520- 09:43.020* :  some of whom have risked their lives in small boats to enter the UK,
*09:43.020- 09:47.080* :  has been repeatedly opposed by the upper house, the House of Lords.
*09:47.540- 09:49.780* :  But Mrs. Nax said that both houses of Parliament
*09:49.780- 09:53.740* :  will have to keep sitting and voting until the bill is passed.
*09:54.220- 09:57.760* :  For almost two years our opponents have used every trick in the book
*09:57.760- 10:00.160* :  to block flights and keep the boats coming.
*10:01.060- 10:02.580* :  But enough is enough.
*10:03.240- 10:05.520* :  No more provocation, no more delay.
*10:06.200- 10:10.340* :  Parliament will sit there tonight and vote no matter how late it goes.
*10:11.000- 10:14.720* :  No ifs, no buts, these flights are going to Rwanda.
*10:15.660- 10:17.920* :  We are going to deliver this indispensable deterrent
*10:18.180- 10:22.580* :  so that we finally break the business model of the criminal gangs and save lives.
*10:23.640- 10:26.540* :  Barbara Pletasha is in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.
*10:26.900- 10:29.500* :  I also, why the bill is so controversial?
*10:30.360- 10:32.380* :  Well, it's controversial because first of all,
*10:32.380- 10:38.020* :  there is the whole principle of deporting asylum seekers to another country
*10:38.020- 10:41.880* :  and saying that Britain doesn't want them and doesn't want to process them.
*10:41.880- 10:43.160* :  So there's that larger picture.
*10:43.260- 10:47.220* :  But the more sort of significant thing is that the Supreme Court
*10:47.220- 10:51.120* :  had objected to this deal because it said Rwanda was not a safe country
*10:51.780- 10:53.340* :  for refugees and asylum seekers.
*10:53.960- 10:57.840* :  And so the UK government and Rwanda, they signed a treaty
*10:57.840- 11:00.320* :  dealing with some of the concerns that the court had.
*11:00.320- 11:03.560* :  Principally, it was the possibility or the risk
*11:04.040- 11:08.260* :  that Rwanda might deport some of these people back to their countries of origin.
*11:08.420- 11:10.460* :  And that has been mentioned in the treaty.
*11:10.460- 11:14.480* :  And now both Rwanda and the UK are trying to put that into law.
*11:14.640- 11:19.420* :  And this law in the UK is basically saying this means that Rwanda is safe.
*11:19.420- 11:26.720* :  It also means that it'll make it harder for asylum seekers to appeal against being moved there.
*11:26.920- 11:31.400* :  And the cost of this has mounted, I think it goes into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
*11:32.280- 11:37.020* :  And yet, I don't think that many migrants are expected, possibly a few hundred?
*11:38.000- 11:43.860* :  Well, initially when the deal was made, the idea was to send many, many of the migrants here.
*11:44.420- 11:48.640* :  At this point, it seems what the government is hoping to do is at least get one plane
*11:48.640- 11:54.820* :  load of refugees or asylum seekers to Rwanda to underline the point that the bill has been passed
*11:54.820- 11:55.920* :  and that this is their policy.
*11:55.920- 11:58.180* :  But of course, there's an election coming up in the UK.
*11:58.180- 12:02.220* :  And the Labour Party has said if it wins, it's not going to support this policy.
*12:02.220- 12:06.620* :  So in the end, it might only be a few hundred.
*12:07.060- 12:11.120* :  But the bigger picture is that there are countries in Europe that are watching this process.
*12:11.440- 12:15.380* :  And if the Britain finds a legal way to get around objections
*12:16.120- 12:20.320* :  by the European Commission for Human Rights, then it may well serve as a precedent
*12:20.320- 12:22.400* :  for other countries to try similar policies.
*12:23.800- 12:26.040* :  And what do people in Rwanda make of all this?
*12:27.220- 12:29.620* :  It will not get any attention here that it gets in the UK.
*12:29.620- 12:33.240* :  So a couple of people that we spoke to said this would be good for the economy.
*12:33.240- 12:34.980* :  It would mean there'd be more consumers.
*12:35.560- 12:38.540* :  One man that we spoke to felt the opposite
*12:38.540- 12:43.480* :  that there were already not enough jobs and land in this very tiny,
*12:43.480- 12:47.340* :  over a densely populated country to go around for a Rwandans.
*12:47.860- 12:50.960* :  And so just sending more people here would add to the competition.
*12:51.080- 12:54.880* :  And that is the view of the opposition party here in Rwanda as well.
*12:54.880- 12:59.000* :  That the government should be focused on getting more jobs and benefits
*12:59.280- 13:02.100* :  for the people of Rwanda, not accepting migrants.
*13:03.180- 13:05.820* :  Barbara Pletasha in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.
*13:06.420- 13:11.560* :  More than 16,000 American and Filipino troops have begun a joint military exercise
*13:11.560- 13:15.200* :  in the Philippines which they're describing as their most expansive yet.
*13:15.740- 13:20.280* :  The exercise which also involves the French Navy takes place at a time of heightened tensions
*13:20.380- 13:24.800* :  between the Philippines and China over disputed islands in the South China Sea.
*13:25.560- 13:30.560* :  Beijing has warned Minila against bringing in external forces which it says could threaten
*13:30.560- 13:35.840* :  regional stability. Zhang Zhushia is vice chair of China's Central Military Commission.
*13:38.500- 13:43.440* :  As our president has pointed out, the Pacific Ocean is large enough to accommodate
*13:43.440- 13:50.260* :  all countries of the Pacific. The Chinese people advocate peace and have no intention of engaging
*13:50.260- 13:56.280* :  in a cold or hot war with any country. But territorial sovereignty is viable.
*13:56.940- 14:03.280* :  We will legitimately defend our rights and will resolutely counteract unreachable provocation.
*14:04.240- 14:08.160* :  Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Heard has more details about these large-scale
*14:08.160- 14:13.700* :  drills. There are annual exercises but not on this scale and they're involving things like
*14:13.700- 14:19.120* :  the Typhon missile launch system. It's a medium-range lip missile launch system that could launch
*14:19.120- 14:22.980* :  missiles from the northern Philippines that could actually reach the southern Chinese coast
*14:22.980- 14:29.440* :  and go over Ty 1. The symbolic potency of these exercises at a time like this is not
*14:29.440- 14:34.880* :  being missed by anyone. China has also pointed out they claim that they had a gentleman's agreement
*14:34.880- 14:40.280* :  with the Philippines from the previous administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. It was much more
*14:40.280- 14:45.760* :  pro-Chinese and much more anti-American not to challenge the status quo. The status quo
*14:46.320- 14:50.860* :  in the South China Sea is that China has occupied a number of islands and built quite
*14:50.860- 14:55.000* :  sophisticated facilities. These islands claimed by the Philippines and other countries and
*14:55.000- 15:00.460* :  President Marcos has reversed that conciliatory approach. Obviously the islands, the Philippines
*15:00.460- 15:05.760* :  claims matter a lot to it. There's a lot of Filipino public opinion behind standing up to China
*15:05.760- 15:11.360* :  over these. There's a rusted Filipino landing ship that's been set for a long time
*15:12.780- 15:17.280* :  rotting away on one of the reefs that the Philippines tries to resupply. Every time it does,
*15:17.280- 15:22.120* :  it gets confronted by Chinese naval ships and coast guard ships that attack them with water
*15:22.120- 15:26.020* :  cannon and ramming them. That's been going on for a while and that's where one set of exercises
*15:26.020- 15:30.940* :  will take place. That's very much the show of support by the US and other partners for the Philippines
*15:30.940- 15:37.000* :  in that area. Against that backdrop, seeing the Philippines bring on these very sophisticated
*15:37.100- 15:42.860* :  joint exercises with the US and other countries and inevitably is seen by China as a show force
*15:42.860- 15:48.460* :  directed to very much at Beijing. The bigger question is, how far is the Philippines going to push
*15:48.460- 15:53.720* :  this? This is a big change of stance by the Philippines. It's now the most assertive country in
*15:53.720- 15:58.360* :  Southeast Asian standing up to China. Yet its own military is quite weak. No one knows quite how
*15:58.360- 16:03.440* :  far they're willing to go in confronting China over these disputed areas. Jonathan Head,
*16:04.240- 16:09.420* :  three people including a married couple have been arrested in Germany on suspicion of spying
*16:09.420- 16:14.840* :  for China. They appeared before judges in the coming days as Jessica Parker reports from Berlin.
*16:15.360- 16:20.160* :  The arrests took place in Western Germany this morning in the city of Dusseldorf and the town
*16:20.160- 16:25.380* :  of Bad Homburg. Searches say the authorities were carried out at the homes and workplaces of
*16:25.380- 16:30.820* :  the three accused. Under German privacy conventions, they've been named only as Thomas R and
*16:30.820- 16:36.580* :  married couple Herwig F and Einer F. The prosecutor says they are strongly suspected of having
*16:36.580- 16:41.940* :  worked for Chinese intelligence by providing information on new technologies that can be used
*16:41.940- 16:47.700* :  for military purposes. It's even alleged a special laser was sent to China without authorization.
*16:47.900- 16:53.820* :  It comes after last week two men were arrested in the southern state of Bavaria on suspicion of
*16:53.820- 16:59.880* :  spying for Russia. Jessica Parker in Berlin. The world's countries are spending more money than
*16:59.880- 17:05.020* :  ever on defence. Figures published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute show that
*17:05.020- 17:11.860* :  lost it nearly two and a half trillion dollars was allocated to military expenditure. The report
*17:11.860- 17:17.400* :  said there was no region in the world where the security situation had improved in 2023.
*17:18.600- 17:23.480* :  Seranjana Tiwari, our business correspondent, has been looking at the figures. She spoke to Rob Young.
*17:24.200- 17:30.000* :  There is because of those wars and rising tension fueling spending across the world. Now this is
*17:30.000- 17:36.160* :  a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and researchers say that military
*17:36.160- 17:41.320* :  spending rolls across the globe, with particularly large increases in Europe, the Middle East,
*17:41.320- 17:48.880* :  and Asia. Researchers saw spending increase across all five geographical regions with the US,
*17:48.880- 17:56.220* :  China, Russia, India and Saudi Arabia being the top five spenders. Any surprises in the list?
*17:56.540- 18:01.620* :  Well, there were a lot of countries that were not a surprise. Ukraine, Russia,
*18:01.620- 18:06.620* :  Israel, as you can imagine, because of the conflicts there. China has always been a big
*18:06.620- 18:13.400* :  spender and continues to increase its spending. Japan is slightly interesting, but obviously there's
*18:13.400- 18:19.600* :  a lot of tensions in the region, and therefore Japan feels the need to bolster its defenses. Taiwan
*18:19.600- 18:27.240* :  also has increased its spending by about 11%. Other surprises are the Dominican Republic,
*18:27.840- 18:35.100* :  fearing gang violence in neighboring Haiti, and the Democratic Republic of Congo also worried
*18:35.100- 18:43.320* :  about tensions growing with neighboring Rwanda, and South Sudan saw an increase of 78%, which was
*18:43.320- 18:49.140* :  the second largest increase out of all the countries pulled. Surinjana, Tawari.
*18:51.560- 18:56.880* :  Still to come in this podcast? Can you do that? Well, as I'm saying yes, I'm thinking of myself,
*18:56.880- 19:03.480* :  that's a ghost hairstyle. And how am I going to actually do it? We hear how David Bowie came up with
*19:03.480- 19:07.440* :  his iconic red spiky hairstyle for Ziggy Stardust.
*19:13.800- 19:17.820* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless
*19:17.820- 19:22.680* :  companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked
*19:22.680- 19:26.540* :  if raising prices technically violates those honorists to your contracts, they said,
*19:26.540- 19:31.840* :  what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t? So to recap, we're cutting the price

*19:56.580- 20:00.380* :  the globe. And honestly, even at that point of reporting to a journalist, I don't think I really
*20:00.380- 20:06.520* :  knew that that was in itself an act of whistleblowing. Expect the unexpected. The only future is
*20:06.680- 20:12.420* :  death here. So if we live, we might have a chance. We will die anyway, but we will die trying.

*20:25.120- 20:31.740* :  Welcome back to the Global News podcast. It's not just Israel that Iran has attacked in recent
*20:31.740- 20:37.360* :  weeks and months. In January, it fired missiles on a border region of Pakistan, which provoked
*20:37.360- 20:43.600* :  a retaliatory strike. Now as the two Muslim neighbours seek to mend their relations after those
*20:43.600- 20:50.740* :  unprecedented tit-for-tat military attacks, the Iranian president, Abraham Reisi, is visiting Pakistan.
*20:57.740- 21:02.560* :  The red carpet was rolled out and there was a guard of honour. Our Pakistan correspondent,
*21:02.600- 21:07.160* :  Caroline Davis, told us more about the significance of the Iranian leaders visit.
*21:07.780- 21:12.360* :  Well, I'm currently sitting opposite one of the main roundabouts here in Islamabad, which is
*21:12.360- 21:16.920* :  covered in both Iranian and Pakistan flags. And lots of symbols saying Pakistan, Iran,
*21:16.920- 21:22.460* :  together in progress, long live Pakistan, Iran, friendship. So this is really a very much a show
*21:22.460- 21:26.100* :  from both sides. They want to signal that this is a good relationship between the two. Of course,
*21:26.100- 21:31.240* :  this comes against the backdrop of back in January, as you mentioned, that Iran launched missiles
*21:31.240- 21:36.620* :  that hit inside Pakistan territory, saying it was targeting a militant group. Pakistan then
*21:36.620- 21:40.680* :  responded in kind and hit inside Iranian territory, saying they were hitting a militant group.
*21:40.780- 21:44.540* :  And since then, they seem to have come to some form of kind of brotherly relations between
*21:44.540- 21:50.180* :  the two. But that does mean that this is a very important visit by the Iranian president here.
*21:50.180- 21:54.600* :  They have particularly emphasised that this is about trade and trying to increase the amount of
*21:54.600- 21:59.420* :  trade between the two countries. But there is going to be a discussion as well. They understand
*21:59.420- 22:06.180* :  about energy and security. Yes, because Pakistan has historically been very close to Saudi Arabia,
*22:06.180- 22:09.580* :  but it very much wants to get its hands on some of that Iranian gas.
*22:10.420- 22:14.700* :  Yes, and that is the crucially important part here. And this has been a sort of a sort of fraught
*22:15.100- 22:20.080* :  dynamic as well to try to make that final feel. It's been a long time in the in the pipeline.
*22:20.080- 22:23.800* :  And so that is something that's expected to be discussed. And maybe you might get an
*22:23.800- 22:29.820* :  announcement later about that. But interestingly, earlier on last week, the around about was
*22:29.820- 22:35.100* :  decorated very differently then. They had a Saudi delegation in town. And instead of the Iranian flag,
*22:35.100- 22:40.420* :  we had the Saudi Arabian flag as well. So Pakistan really trying to reach out to all of
*22:41.060- 22:46.740* :  its potential allies in the area, all of the countries nearby that it thinks it can make
*22:47.640- 22:54.600* :  deals with. Pakistan is in a difficult economic position still. We know that they are negotiating
*22:54.600- 23:00.140* :  a deal with the IMF at the moment, the International Monetary Fund, to make sure that it will be able
*23:00.140- 23:06.940* :  to continue to make its balance of payments. But we also know that they are in a dangerous
*23:06.940- 23:11.700* :  difficult position with energy as well. They need to make sure that their energy supplies are
*23:11.700- 23:15.520* :  strong enough and a particularly key point is to make sure that they are good enough strong enough
*23:15.520- 23:20.860* :  for the summer when all of the country is so reliant on being able to have air conditioning
*23:21.540- 23:24.280* :  and fans operating to be able to continue to operate functioning.
*23:24.860- 23:29.700* :  Caroline Davis in Pakistan. Many people have expressed concern about President Biden's
*23:29.700- 23:33.840* :  memory lapses and gaps as he runs for a second term at the White House against Donald Trump.
*23:33.840- 23:38.100* :  Now, Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister has added his voice to the growing chorus.
*23:38.560- 23:44.060* :  James Morapay made it clear he was unhappy that Mr. Biden had implied that his long-lost uncle
*23:44.160- 23:50.360* :  may have been eaten by cannibals after being shot down over Papua New Guinea during the Second World
*23:50.360- 23:56.160* :  War. Mickey Bristo reports. A plane carrying President Biden's Uncle Ambrose Finnegan
*23:56.540- 24:00.940* :  ditched into the sea off the northern coast of Papua New Guinea in 1944.
*24:01.700- 24:07.680* :  Uncle Bosie's body was never found. But last week while speaking at a war memorial in Pennsylvania,
*24:08.620- 24:12.300* :  President Biden speculated about what might have happened to him.
*24:12.840- 24:18.060* :  Uncle Bosie, with those single engine planes, has reconnaissance over war zones.
*24:18.920- 24:25.240* :  He got shot down in New Guinea and they never found the body because there used to be
*24:25.720- 24:28.640* :  a lot of cannibals for real in that part of New Guinea.
*24:29.060- 24:33.100* :  The Papua Prime Minister, James Morapay, has dismissed Mr. Biden's gaff,
*24:33.560- 24:38.980* :  putting it down to a blurry moment. But the Prime Minister also made two serious points.
*24:39.780- 24:45.180* :  While Papua New Guinea does have some history of cannibalism, there's no evidence that Mr. Biden's
*24:45.180- 24:50.880* :  uncle met this fate. Mr. Morapay said his country didn't deserve to continually be the
*24:50.880- 24:57.400* :  butt of this punchline. He also used the opportunity to urge the US to clearly unexploded bombs
*24:57.400- 25:02.880* :  at still litter the nation. He said the Second World War had been nothing to do with his people,
*25:03.520- 25:05.320* :  but they'd been dragged into it anyway.
*25:06.620- 25:10.680* :  Mickey Bristo. At the height of the Lebanese Civil War in the 1980s,
*25:10.680- 25:16.100* :  dozens of foreigners, mostly Westerners, were kidnapped by Islamist extremists. Of those that
*25:16.100- 25:20.660* :  survived, the hostage who was held the longest was the American journalist Terry Anderson.
*25:21.340- 25:26.580* :  He endured nearly seven years of appalling conditions before finally being released to a
*25:26.580- 25:32.400* :  hero's welcome in the US. He has now died at the age of 76. Despite being beaten,
*25:32.400- 25:38.500* :  chained to a wall, and repeatedly threatened with death by his captors, Mr. Anderson never stopped
*25:38.500- 25:43.980* :  challenging them. Alfie Habison looks back at his life. Terry Anderson was a journalist who
*25:43.980- 25:49.600* :  became part of the story he covered. He grew up in Ohio before fighting for the Marines in
*25:49.600- 25:55.220* :  the Vietnam War as a staff sergeant. His reporting for the Associated Press then took him across
*25:55.220- 26:01.600* :  the globe to Kentucky, Japan, and South Africa before he arrived in Lebanon as chief of the Middle
*26:01.600- 26:07.740* :  East Bureau. Based in Beirut, he had spent several years reporting on the rising violence that
*26:07.740- 26:14.200* :  was gripping a war-torn Lebanon. Until one day, in 1985, when returning home with a friend
*26:14.200- 26:19.060* :  from a tennis match, he was bundled into the back of a green Mercedes by Gunman.
*26:19.900- 26:24.780* :  And he did not return home again for nearly seven years, spending the majority of that time
*26:24.780- 26:31.300* :  chained and blindfolded in solitary confinement. At the time, he was one of more than a dozen
*26:31.300- 26:36.440* :  Westerners held hostage in Lebanon by Islamist groups, and he was also the last to be let go.
*26:37.280- 26:43.220* :  When he was released, it was a moment of celebration in America, with his face plastered across
*26:43.220- 26:49.980* :  Time magazine, captioned The Smile of Freedom. As he addressed the world in a press conference,
*26:49.980- 26:58.240* :  he seemed energized and upbeat. Yesterday afternoon, my captors came in, brought some new clothes,
*27:00.540- 27:03.240* :  new shoes, my first and seven years, and they hurt my feet, by the way.
*27:03.240- 27:11.620* :  And they said that I would be going home today. I can't spend the day pacing the rum and playing
*27:11.620- 27:16.220* :  Saturday and waiting. I think this last 24 hours had been longer than the whole six and a half years.
*27:17.140- 27:22.400* :  But he later admitted that the experience had left him deeply scarred and almost caused him to go
*27:22.400- 27:28.040* :  insane, crediting his Roman Catholic faith and stubborn personality for helping him survive.
*27:29.200- 27:34.380* :  In his final years, he taught at several prominent universities, but also lent into new interests,
*27:34.900- 27:40.340* :  operating a blues bar, occasion restaurant, and a horse ranch. His daughter,
*27:40.340- 27:46.720* :  Salomi Anderson, also a journalist, described her dad as a hero, who was content with the life he
*27:46.720- 27:53.560* :  had led. Alfie Habeson, looking back on the life of Terry Anderson, who has died at the age of
*27:53.560- 28:00.640* :  76. A newly discovered masterpiece by the Italian Renaissance painter Raphael has gone on public
*28:00.640- 28:06.660* :  display in the south of France after being sold for a fraction of its true value. The small portrait
*28:06.660- 28:11.880* :  of Mary Magdalene was bought from a London gallery. Neither the seller nor the buyer had known the
*28:11.880- 28:18.880* :  identity of the artist, Terry Egan reports. The centenary, Madeline Basilica, houses what are said
*28:18.880- 28:24.580* :  to be the remains of Mary Magdalene, making it Christianity's third most important tomb.
*28:25.320- 28:31.880* :  Now for a month, it's also housing a portrait which since September is known to have been painted
*28:31.880- 28:38.080* :  by the great Raphael. It was bought by an unnamed collector from a London gallery's website
*28:38.080- 28:45.500* :  for nearly $40,000 before he called in art experts in Italy. Numerous analyses followed,
*28:45.500- 28:51.920* :  including by infrared light, which revealed layers of carbon under the paint. And then,
*28:51.920- 28:58.040* :  not without controversy, the picture of Mary was sensationally attributed to the Renaissance
*28:58.040- 29:04.420* :  master. Now it's being displayed in a place that couldn't be more fitting. Mary Magdalene is a
*29:04.420- 29:10.000* :  crucial figure in the story of Jesus. She is said to have been a repentant sinner, but was perhaps
*29:10.000- 29:16.320* :  the first to witness his resurrection, and recent stories have implied an even more intimate
*29:16.320- 29:22.020* :  relationship between them. Either way, many believe she spent the last years of her life
*29:22.060- 29:28.380* :  in France in a cave near the Basilica, which makes it an important site for pilgrims.
*29:29.020- 29:33.740* :  And so, people have been duly queuing up there to see the unassuming masterpiece,
*29:34.360- 29:41.200* :  and handing over three euros for the privilege. A small price to pay perhaps for a glimpse of
*29:41.200- 29:49.340* :  this startling take by a 16th century genius on someone so closely associated with Jesus.
*29:50.480- 29:56.900* :  Terry Egan reporting. When it comes to iconic rock hairstyles, there's Elvis' quiff,
*29:57.140- 30:03.220* :  the Beatles' mop tops and the long-flowing locks of many rock stars. But one rock haircut,
*30:03.220- 30:10.040* :  not any stands out, but stands up. That's David Bowie's red spiky Ziggy Star Dust haircut,
*30:10.040- 30:16.760* :  one that helped inspire generations of glam and punk rockers. With a new album of remix and unheard
*30:16.760- 30:21.780* :  of Bowie tracks out this month from his Ziggy Star Dust days, the BBC caught up with one of
*30:21.780- 30:26.760* :  those closest to him from that time, his hair stylist and friend Susie Ronson, the woman who
*30:26.760- 30:32.880* :  crafted that iconic Ziggy cut and colour. She said it all began with a visit to Bowie's home
*30:32.880- 30:38.920* :  to perm his wife Angie's hair. Well, she changed her mind about the perm, but David was there,
*30:39.220- 30:43.800* :  and David and her were talking about cutting his hair short. He had kind of longish blonde hair
*30:43.800- 30:48.440* :  at the time. So he asked me my opinion and I said, well, no one's got short hair and it was
*30:48.440- 30:52.240* :  true nobody did. You know, when you think about who else was out there rolling stones,
*30:52.240- 30:58.020* :  Led Zeppelin, they all had long hair. I said, it might look really good. So that's when he got up
*30:58.020- 31:03.380* :  and he showed me this photograph in a magazine. I've a girl model with a short red spike here
*31:03.680- 31:08.660* :  and he said, can you do that? Well, as I'm saying, yes, I'm thinking of myself, that's a girl's
*31:08.700- 31:14.200* :  hair style. And how am I going to actually do it? But when I looked at him, I mean, I thought, my
*31:14.200- 31:21.080* :  God, if anyone could pull this one off, he could. Tall, rock star thin, lovely long white neck,
*31:21.080- 31:26.340* :  great face. I mean, it would look really good if I could do it. Well, I did it and of course,
*31:26.340- 31:32.200* :  it didn't stand up. I was cautiously optimistic. But when I finished, it wouldn't stand up,
*31:32.200- 31:37.360* :  it just kind of flopped. It looked like a schoolboy. So I went away, I found the color. We had a
*31:37.360- 31:42.420* :  junior at the salon. She had the same color hair as David, kind of blondy, bouncy, brown thing.
*31:42.720- 31:48.220* :  So I took a sip of her hair and experimented. And I found the color, red hot red by Schwarzkopf.
*31:48.580- 31:54.520* :  I used a high volume prox, I had to give it some left, voila, that was the color. Then I thought
*31:54.520- 31:59.860* :  about using the guard to make it stand up and it worked. Huge wave of relief, wasn't over me.
*32:00.420- 32:05.020* :  We didn't have any setting lotions like that in those days. This particular treatment,
*32:05.700- 32:10.460* :  main hair sets like stone. And I used that. I poured a liberal amount of it, washed it all through
*32:10.460- 32:15.600* :  his hair and dried it and pulled it away from his head and pulled it away from his head. And it stood up.
*32:16.220- 32:17.000* :  Susie Ronson.
*32:20.220- 32:23.840* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
