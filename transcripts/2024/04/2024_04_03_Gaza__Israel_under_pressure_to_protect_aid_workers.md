*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news 7 days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:20.260* :  by advertising. People fixing the world is the podcast looking for solutions to the problems
*00:20.260- 00:25.240* :  we face today. It could potentially ease the suffering of millions. We have a solution.
*00:25.240- 00:29.560* :  Let's do it. People fixing the world from the BBC World Service.
*00:35.300- 00:38.800* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:40.440- 00:46.920* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday the 3rd of April, these are our main stories.
*00:47.480- 00:52.940* :  Israel is under increasing international pressure to investigate its strike which killed seven
*00:52.940- 00:59.420* :  aid workers in Gaza. Rescue workers in Taiwan try to free motorists trapped in road tunnels by a
*00:59.420- 01:07.900* :  powerful earthquake. Also in this podcast the top appeals caught in Uganda upholds a controversial
*01:07.900- 01:14.360* :  anti-homosexuality law considered one of the toughest in the world and in France shared grief
*01:14.360- 01:18.680* :  is leading to shed healing at an orphanage for the children of police officers.
*01:19.100- 01:26.180* :  My dad was my hero but he never spoke about his job. I came here a month after he died.
*01:26.680- 01:28.860* :  Things were difficult. I was dropping out of school.
*01:33.120- 01:38.900* :  Israel is facing growing international condemnation over the killing of seven men and women
*01:38.900- 01:44.380* :  delivering humanitarian assistance in Gaza on Monday night. The aid workers killed were from
*01:44.380- 01:49.980* :  the World Central Kitchen which is now suspended its operations in Gaza. In a statement,
*01:49.980- 01:55.420* :  Israel's army chief Lieutenant General Hersey Halavi called the incident a grave mistake,
*01:55.420- 02:01.220* :  blaming a misidentification. He also insisted a full investigation would be carried out.
*02:01.680- 02:09.060* :  An independent body will investigate the incident thoroughly. We will complete it in the next
*02:09.140- 02:15.600* :  coming days. We will learn from the conclusions and implement them immediately.
*02:16.860- 02:25.000* :  We will share in full transparency the findings of the investigation with the World Central Kitchen
*02:25.900- 02:31.640* :  and other international relevant organizations. He bought TBS from Care International.
*02:31.640- 02:37.280* :  She says agencies are used to uncertainty but the escalating situation may push more to
*02:37.280- 02:43.140* :  suspend their operations. Now it is again confirmed that there is nothing safe in Gaza unfortunately.
*02:43.440- 02:47.780* :  Already it's very dangerous for the teams on the ground to do what they want to do. The mandate
*02:47.780- 02:53.180* :  that they are mandated to do to help the people and I'm telling you in the future you will see
*02:53.180- 02:58.540* :  again World Central Kitchen workers going back to help the people in Gaza but in the future I cannot
*02:58.540- 03:03.900* :  guarantee what will be the situation. Israel promised an independent investigation after the UK,
*03:03.900- 03:10.020* :  US, Canada, Australia and Poland lost nationals in the attack. There have been calls for the US
*03:10.020- 03:15.300* :  and the UK to stop selling weapons to Israel. But the British Foreign Secretary David Cameron
*03:15.300- 03:20.540* :  has said he welcomes Israel's promise to investigate the strike and do more to support aid
*03:20.540- 03:24.900* :  deliveries. We've been promised these things before and this really needs to happen including
*03:25.460- 03:31.640* :  longer opening times at the vital crossing points. But of course the extra aid won't work unless
*03:31.640- 03:38.120* :  there is proper deconfliction, unless aid can be taken around Gaza and we avoid the dreadful
*03:38.120- 03:43.440* :  incidents like we've seen in the last couple of days. That is vital and Britain will be watching
*03:43.440- 03:47.860* :  very closely to make sure that that happens. I spoke earlier to our Middle East correspondent
*03:47.860- 03:53.200* :  Yolanda Nell who's in Jerusalem. We're seeing a lot more pressure now on Israel to do something to
*03:53.200- 03:58.580* :  protect aid workers to put better systems in place so that they can coordinate with the Israeli
*03:58.580- 04:04.100* :  military so that they can work more effectively and safely. In general Israel's been blaming poor
*04:04.100- 04:09.540* :  communications between the World Central Kitchen team and its troops on the ground. I mean it remains
*04:09.540- 04:13.940* :  to be seen if there will be improvements now to humanitarian operations. They're talking about
*04:13.940- 04:19.280* :  some plans such as setting up a new war room jointly operated by the Israeli military and aid
*04:19.280- 04:25.160* :  organizations to coordinate things going on on the ground. But humanitarian organizations are pulling
*04:25.160- 04:30.020* :  out and understandably so and this at a time when there is a desperate humanitarian crisis.
*04:30.020- 04:34.960* :  What is going to happen? How is food going to reach people? Yeah I mean this is really just an
*04:35.140- 04:40.300* :  awful situation because already we've had for weeks now international outcry about how there's
*04:40.300- 04:46.480* :  just a trickle of aid getting into Gaza because of Israeli controls, Israel denying that it limits
*04:46.480- 04:53.020* :  things even questioning that the basis of UN reports saying that there is a famine looming in Gaza.
*04:53.540- 05:01.180* :  Now because this issue about the safety of aid workers has really come to the fore that's
*05:01.180- 05:08.040* :  limiting assistance making them question what they ask their staff to do on the ground even more.
*05:08.420- 05:12.760* :  And you know there's just been real repercussions of that we've been hearing from just ordinary
*05:13.240- 05:19.100* :  people in Rafa in the south of the Gaza strip. There had been looking to these kitchens which
*05:19.100- 05:25.480* :  world central kitchen had set up to feed people for their daily meals for some form of sustenance.
*05:25.480- 05:31.180* :  They said they were feeding about 350,000 people a day. Now those guards are saying how do they
*05:31.180- 05:37.700* :  feed their children? How are Israeli citizens responding to this attack? This has been followed. There's
*05:37.700- 05:42.640* :  been a lot of interest in exactly how this could have happened. It's been picked over from that
*05:42.640- 05:48.600* :  point of view. But I think most Israelis accept that this was a mistake. They're still broad support
*05:48.600- 05:54.700* :  for the war that's taking place. There hasn't been a huge amount of coverage in the Israeli media about
*05:54.700- 06:00.440* :  the circumstances which are leading to the UN warning about famine approaching in Gaza.
*06:01.320- 06:05.520* :  And so right now just you know looking at the news this has sort of dropped down to the bottom
*06:05.520- 06:07.900* :  of the of the news bulletins in Israel this morning.
*06:08.520- 06:14.860* :  Yo Land Nell in Jerusalem. Two Taiwan now where rescue efforts are taking place after a powerful
*06:14.860- 06:21.580* :  earthquake struck off its east coast. Taiwan's national fire agency said at least 700 people
*06:21.580- 06:27.940* :  have been injured while 77 people remain trapped. Officials say so far nine people are known to have
*06:27.940- 06:33.080* :  died. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield haze was in the capital Taipei when the earthquake struck.
*06:33.900- 06:38.180* :  The shaking was intense and prolonged. Buildings across the city swayed violently.
*06:38.180- 06:43.360* :  Cubards were emptied furniture toppled. No one in the Taiwanese capital has experienced
*06:43.360- 06:49.540* :  anything like this in a quarter of a century. Many young people have never felt shaking on this
*06:49.540- 06:55.380* :  scale. On the east coast in the city of Hualien the shaking was much stronger and the damage much
*06:55.380- 07:00.980* :  more severe. People on their way to work watched in fear and awe as a partially collapsed building
*07:00.980- 07:06.640* :  was left leaning at a precarious angle but it is the landslides that have unleashed the greatest
*07:06.640- 07:12.160* :  terror. The east coast of Taiwan is a rugged landscape of high mountains and deep valleys.
*07:12.160- 07:17.240* :  The quake triggered hundreds of landslides that came roaring down into the valleys below.
*07:17.240- 07:22.700* :  This is where most of the more than 700 injuries must have happened. People would have had
*07:22.700- 07:27.520* :  little warning and nowhere to escape. Taiwan has done much to strengthen its buildings and
*07:27.520- 07:33.060* :  infrastructure since another huge quake killed more than 2,000 people back in 1999.
*07:34.100- 07:37.960* :  This time few buildings have been brought down and the death toll is so far
*07:37.960- 07:43.620* :  mercifully small but there is little that can be done to stop a mountain from falling into the
*07:43.620- 07:48.900* :  valley below. A tsunami warning has been declared for nearby Japanese islands in the southern
*07:48.900- 07:55.280* :  prefecture of Okinawa but has now been lifted. Our correspondent Shima Khalil is in Tokyo and told
*07:55.280- 08:00.400* :  me people are still being warned to be on high alert. It's been quite a tense day here in Japan
*08:00.400- 08:06.340* :  actually even though the tsunami warning has been lifted because quite concerning that for the
*08:06.340- 08:10.960* :  first time in more than a decade the meteorological agency has issued a tsunami warning for the
*08:10.960- 08:16.600* :  coastal areas in the Okinawa prefecture in the southwest triggered, of course, by that very strong
*08:17.100- 08:22.740* :  earthquake in Taiwan. Some of these islands in Okinawa are very, very close to Taiwan.
*08:22.740- 08:28.580* :  Yonaguni Island, for example, which was hit by a 30 centimeter wave, not the three meter wave
*08:28.580- 08:35.740* :  that was expected, is very close to Taiwan that on a clear day in some of these areas, in some areas
*08:35.740- 08:42.820* :  in Yonaguni Island, you can see the Taiwanese coast. Earlier, we've also heard of alarm
*08:42.820- 08:48.120* :  sounding repeatedly in different parts of Okinawa. Some residents described how scared they were
*08:48.120- 08:55.840* :  that their phones as well, alarms rang on their fours quite loudly. Yes, the authorities may
*08:55.840- 09:01.060* :  have lifted the initial tsunami warning but given how big the earthquake is in Taiwan, giving
*09:01.060- 09:06.500* :  how fluid the situation is as well, the meteorological agency is warning residents of possible
*09:06.500- 09:12.120* :  tidal change but also possible aftershocks. And given the history, tsunami warnings for many
*09:12.120- 09:17.020* :  people in Japan, the stuff of nightmares? It is the stuff of nightmares. Remember that in the very
*09:17.020- 09:24.020* :  beginning of this year, a very powerful earthquake, a 7.8 magnitude hit central Japan and caused a
*09:24.020- 09:28.800* :  great deal of damage and fatalities. One of the residents that I was speaking to the Kyoto
*09:28.800- 09:32.720* :  news agency actually said there have been many warnings and there have been earthquakes quite a
*09:32.720- 09:37.540* :  lot this year that I'm actually scared. But of course, the biggest and most traumatic memory
*09:37.540- 09:44.680* :  in recent memory here in Japan is that is the earthquake of 2011, that 9.0 magnitude earthquake
*09:44.680- 09:52.620* :  tsunami that led to the leak in Fukushima. And so people in Japan are quite alarmed even
*09:52.620- 09:57.280* :  though they're used to so many earthquakes, even though they're used to these shakes that
*09:57.280- 10:01.960* :  happen almost on a daily basis because of how many earthquakes happen here. I think the magnitude
*10:01.960- 10:08.360* :  of the alert and the repeated alarms have actually scared a lot of people until they were lifted,
*10:08.360- 10:11.760* :  but people are still told to remain on high alert.
*10:12.600- 10:18.760* :  Shai Murkhalil and before her we heard from Rupert Wingfield Hayes. The constitutional court in
*10:18.760- 10:25.240* :  Uganda has refused to strike down a draconian anti-gay law, although the judges said parts of it
*10:25.240- 10:30.900* :  violated constitutional rights. The law has been condemned internationally by Braplettarsche
*10:30.900- 10:36.140* :  reports. The law is one of the toughest in the world. It imposes life imprisonment for
*10:36.140- 10:41.220* :  consensual same-sex relations and the death penalty for acts that it describes as aggravated
*10:41.220- 10:46.760* :  homosexuality. Legal and human rights activists had argued that it violates fundamental rights
*10:46.760- 10:53.240* :  guaranteed by Uganda's constitution. The court partly agreed it refused to strike down the law,
*10:53.740- 10:59.080* :  but it did nullify some sections that criminalize behavior, such as allowing gay sex to happen
*10:59.080- 11:04.760* :  in one's property, failing to report acts of homosexuality, and giving someone a terminal illness
*11:04.760- 11:12.660* :  through gay sex. Barbara Plettarsche. Pope Francis has given a unique insight into the manoeuvrings
*11:12.660- 11:18.680* :  that led to the election of his predecessor, Pope Benedict. The revelations come in excerpts from
*11:18.680- 11:23.560* :  a forthcoming book based on a Spanish journalist's interviews with the Pope, Mark Duff reports.
*11:24.220- 11:29.780* :  The election of the new head of the Roman Catholic Church is synonymous with secrecy. The conclave,
*11:29.780- 11:35.560* :  as it's known, takes place behind locked doors in the Sistine Chapel in the heart of Vatican City.
*11:35.980- 11:41.300* :  Its participants, the most senior bishops of the Church, its cardinals, are sworn to keep their
*11:41.300- 11:47.900* :  discussion secret in perpetuity. In excerpts from a forthcoming book, though, Francis gives that idea
*11:47.900- 11:54.340* :  short shrift. Cardinals may be sworn to keep quiet, he says, but popes are allowed to tell.
*11:54.980- 12:00.780* :  And the tale he has to tell is intriguing. One of Byzantine machinations surrounding the election
*12:00.780- 12:08.460* :  of his predecessor, Benedict, in 2005. Francis says he was used as a stalking horse by Cardinals
*12:08.460- 12:13.220* :  trying to block the election of the then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Benedict,
*12:13.820- 12:19.920* :  a man who was controversial in his own right for his socially and doctrinally conservative views.
*12:20.760- 12:27.340* :  Francis then Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires was having none of it. He told the
*12:27.340- 12:33.220* :  plotters that he wouldn't serve as Pope if elected under such circumstances. And after that,
*12:33.220- 12:38.800* :  he says, it was only a matter of time before a puff of white smoke emerged from the Sistine
*12:38.800- 12:44.840* :  Chapel, the traditional signal for the election of a new Pope, Benedict the 16th.
*12:45.440- 12:51.640* :  Mark Duff. Police in France are facing growing scrutiny over allegations of violence which
*12:51.640- 12:56.880* :  have provoked nationwide protests. We've reported on some of those incidents, but we seldom look
*12:56.880- 13:02.280* :  at the issue from the side of the police themselves. There are concerns about a high suicide rate
*13:02.280- 13:07.720* :  among officers and about the impact on their families. Our Paris correspondent Andrew Harding
*13:07.960- 13:13.560* :  is the first foreign journalist allowed to visit an orphanage for the children of French police.
*13:17.580- 13:25.400* :  17-year-old Eleanor is just back from school. In the kitchen, 10-year-old Eleanor has been helping
*13:25.400- 13:34.500* :  to make lunch, so far so very ordinary. For these domestic scenes are unfolding in a unique space
*13:34.500- 13:39.760* :  on the south coast of France, an orphanage for the children of French police officers.
*13:42.640- 13:47.680* :  Eleanor arrived here in Agde four years ago after her father had taken his own life.
*13:48.740- 13:55.140* :  He'd been one of the first police to respond to this incident. A devastating Islamist attack
*13:55.480- 14:03.900* :  at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in 2015. Afterwards, he'd struggled to live with the horrors he'd
*14:03.900- 14:12.280* :  seen. My dad was my hero, but he never spoke about his job. I came here a month after he died.
*14:12.740- 14:20.580* :  Things were difficult. I was dropping out of school. At the orphanage, Eleanor found
*14:20.580- 14:27.320* :  others wrestling with the same grief, and she found comfort living with children of very different
*14:27.320- 14:34.240* :  ages. I take care of the young kids, they're like brothers and sisters to me. They're going through
*14:34.240- 14:42.620* :  the same things I did, but being small, they don't understand as much. These have been hard years
*14:42.620- 14:51.280* :  for French police. A 2016 funeral here for a married couple, both serving officers, killed by an
*14:51.280- 15:00.080* :  Islamist militant, and relentless allegations of police brutality. These nationwide riots,
*15:00.080- 15:04.560* :  last year, only the latest in a string of angry public responses.
*15:06.320- 15:12.040* :  Hervé Poir is president of Orphéopolis, the charity that runs the orphanages and which
*15:12.040- 15:18.640* :  helps some 3,000 children. This day is not always easy to be the child of a police officer,
*15:19.380- 15:23.880* :  but we need to stick together, and that means that if a policeman dies, we must continue to look
*15:23.880- 15:35.140* :  after the children. That help takes many forms. Alexander lost his father in a police rescue
*15:35.140- 15:42.960* :  accident, but at the age of 18, he's now decided he wants the same career. A local gym in central
*15:42.960- 15:48.400* :  France, another branch of the orphanage, is helping him train for the police entrance exams.
*15:48.520- 15:56.540* :  Alexander says, I want to serve, to protect people. My father taught me the value of discipline
*15:56.540- 16:05.960* :  and hard work. An evening game of football, this system funded by public donations and supported
*16:05.960- 16:13.400* :  by the police, is only and exclusively for the families of police officers. But it is a powerful
*16:13.400- 16:17.180* :  example of how shared grief can lead to shared healing.
*16:21.780- 16:28.860* :  Andrew Harding with that report. Still to come in the Global News Podcast, Moon Residence.
*16:29.960- 16:35.440* :  At the tone, 20 hours, 48 minutes, coordinated universal time.
*16:38.520- 16:43.860* :  Forget Greenwich Meantime, you will soon have coordinated lunar time.
*16:52.020- 16:56.000* :  The information spaces we inhabit can resemble a whole of mirrors.
*16:56.000- 17:01.020* :  It's called guided democracy or managed democracy. There are different parties,
*17:01.020- 17:04.900* :  different candidates, but everyone knows who is going to win.
*17:04.980- 17:08.240* :  The Global Jigsaw is the podcast helping you make sense of them.
*17:08.520- 17:13.000* :  We've seen a crackdown on the opposition, we've seen an increase in censorship.
*17:13.000- 17:18.180* :  That's the Global Jigsaw from the BBC World Service. Listen now by searching for the
*17:18.340- 17:20.800* :  explanation wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:48.540- 17:54.660* :  Even as they have a role to play in fighting climate change. Ernest Schrader is the author of a
*17:54.660- 18:00.640* :  new book The War Below Lithium, Copper and the Global Battle to Power Our Lives. He's been telling
*18:00.640- 18:06.200* :  just in web that we all face difficult decisions. I would say that the tough choices involve
*18:06.200- 18:11.360* :  OK, are there some places that are too special to mine? And if we are going to mine in some places,
*18:11.720- 18:16.280* :  what are the standards by which we would allow mining? And what does that actually look like when
*18:16.280- 18:21.680* :  we engage with host communities and make sure that their desires and their wishes are respected,
*18:22.220- 18:27.080* :  especially when it comes to indigenous lands that have not always historically been treated well?
*18:27.080- 18:31.860* :  So right now, especially in Western countries, there's a whole host of different rules that are
*18:31.860- 18:37.140* :  confusing or not only mining companies, but conservation groups and environmentalists that may oppose
*18:37.180- 18:42.880* :  them. But still the demand for these critical minerals are rising across the globe. So
*18:43.120- 18:47.120* :  therein lies sort of the tension right now. Therein lies the choices. So if we're going to
*18:47.120- 18:52.740* :  have this energy transition, we have to be thinking about where we actually want to produce them.
*18:53.480- 18:58.220* :  And that's the choice. That's the tension. Is it also a case of us having to think about
*18:58.940- 19:05.340* :  whether we can find some other way of powering ourselves in the future that doesn't involve doing
*19:05.380- 19:10.120* :  this? Because I wonder if that's what some people at least listening to this are thinking. They're
*19:10.120- 19:15.780* :  just going from taking one thing out of the ground oil into taking another thing or another set of
*19:15.840- 19:20.440* :  things. Just isn't the answer isn't the long term answer for the planet? Sure, I do have a
*19:20.440- 19:24.280* :  chapter in the book that looks at recycling because one of the main questions I got the more I
*19:24.280- 19:29.520* :  reported out this book was, do we really need more mines? Can we just recycle our way to this green
*19:29.520- 19:36.260* :  energy future? And the simple answer is right now no. Like when we look at the demand projections
*19:36.700- 19:42.760* :  to convert just transportation from a fossil fuel dependent transportation sector to one that's
*19:42.760- 19:48.800* :  entirely dependent on critical minerals required gargantuan increases in the supply of cobalt,
*19:48.800- 19:53.600* :  copper, lithium, nickel, and all these other critical minerals. So just this one talking point
*19:53.600- 19:58.980* :  Justin, I mean, all of the copper that's been mined throughout humanity up into this year right
*19:58.980- 20:04.700* :  now, we're going to have to mine that same volume of copper out to 2050 just to hit the goals of
*20:04.700- 20:08.960* :  the Paris Climate Accords. And that's just for copper. I think at some point we will hit what's
*20:08.960- 20:13.880* :  called a circular economy. We're able to recycle old batteries to get the metals we need for
*20:14.360- 20:18.140* :  future batteries, but it's going to take a lot more mining to actually get to that point.
*20:18.140- 20:22.580* :  I mean, we're talking right now through microphones that are connected by copper wiring and that
*20:22.580- 20:27.500* :  copper had to come from somewhere. I have a chapter in the book that talks about leaf blowers and
*20:27.500- 20:33.020* :  the chapter draws on my own personal experience a few years ago when I was deciding whether or not
*20:33.020- 20:38.280* :  to get a lawnmower for my house. And so because I was writing this book, I decided, okay, well,
*20:38.280- 20:42.740* :  I should get an electric lawnmower. And then I had a friend say, well, if you get a leaf blower,
*20:42.740- 20:47.560* :  you should not get one powered by fossil fuels because they're horrible for the environment.
*20:47.560- 20:51.180* :  And I did my homework and indeed they are pretty horrible for the environment. So I got an
*20:51.180- 20:56.180* :  electric leaf blower. And that led me down this big rabbit hole of, okay, where do the critical
*20:56.180- 21:03.440* :  minerals in this leaf blower come from? Do the supplies of nickel come from Indonesia where
*21:03.440- 21:09.560* :  rainforests have been dug up in order to supply nickel and do the supplies of cobalt come from the
*21:09.560- 21:13.720* :  Democratic Republic of the Congo where sometimes children as young as seven can be part of the
*21:13.720- 21:18.320* :  supply chain. If we can't actually prove the provenance of them, then that sort of lays bare,
*21:18.320- 21:23.600* :  how we just don't really know how all of these electronic gadgets and gizmos we use every single
*21:23.600- 21:29.440* :  day are actually built. We as consumers across the world should pay more attention to these
*21:29.440- 21:35.060* :  supply chains and actually recognize that our everyday purchasing power has a direct effect on how
*21:35.060- 21:40.640* :  these materials are mined. And so that would require some tough choices like our, if we don't like
*21:40.640- 21:46.260* :  children mining cobalt out of the Congo, which I think as a base case, we can say nobody likes
*21:46.260- 21:50.900* :  that. Well, then are we willing to allow more cobalt mining in areas that we might consider
*21:51.500- 21:58.780* :  Ernest Shader speaking to Justin Webb. In Thailand, the Constitutional Court has accepted a case
*21:58.780- 22:04.640* :  which seeks to dissolve the main opposition move forward party. The petition was filed by the
*22:04.640- 22:10.560* :  Election Commission over the party's manifesto promise to reform the Harsh Les Majesté Law,
*22:10.560- 22:16.940* :  which criminalises any negative comment about the monarchy. Jonathan Head is in Bangkok and told
*22:16.940- 22:22.500* :  me about the impact it will have on the move forward party. It is a blow although it's probably one
*22:22.500- 22:27.360* :  of the most widely anticipated moves in Thailand. Everyone knew this was going to happen and it's not
*22:27.360- 22:33.020* :  new. The Constitutional Court has done this many times before against parties and politicians
*22:33.840- 22:39.660* :  who have policies or approaches to government that are deemed too radical or too threatening to
*22:39.660- 22:45.840* :  the status quo. This protects the proposal by the party that the Les Majesté Law, they weren't
*22:45.840- 22:49.540* :  proposing abolishing it. They would just say it should be rather less harsh and a little less
*22:49.540- 22:55.560* :  easy to invoke. That has been judged sufficient to merit, dissolving it despite the tremendous
*22:55.560- 23:00.500* :  mandate they got from their election performance last year. So what will be the consequences for
*23:00.500- 23:05.920* :  the party if the court rules against it? When the parties dissolved, it also results in its top
*23:05.920- 23:11.200* :  leadership suffering political sanctions. It's usually a ban from politics for quite long periods,
*23:11.200- 23:16.420* :  usually 10 years or longer and could possibly result in some criminal penalties or criminal
*23:16.420- 23:23.380* :  cases being filed against them. For the rest of the party and its elected MPs, they have the option
*23:23.380- 23:29.820* :  to move to a different party and because party disillusions are such a normal part of Thailand's
*23:30.240- 23:35.340* :  political culture, any party that thinks this is going to happen usually prepares and registers
*23:36.140- 23:40.640* :  another party, a sort of sleeper party, to act as an alternative. Indeed, move forward itself
*23:40.640- 23:46.040* :  is an alternative party to its predecessor future forward, which did very well in a previous
*23:46.040- 23:51.820* :  election and was also banned and dissolved for the same reason. However, when future forward was
*23:51.820- 23:57.100* :  dissolved in 2020, that not only sparked off the biggest political protest Thailand and seen in
*23:57.100- 24:02.340* :  a long time with unprecedented public calls for reforms for the monarchy, but also appears to have
*24:02.340- 24:07.300* :  led to its successor party move forward actually performing better. So it's quite possible that
*24:07.300- 24:12.220* :  even though move forward now gets dissolved, whatever successor party follows it, still wearing
*24:12.220- 24:17.800* :  this reformist mantle, may do even better at the next election. And I think it's beginning to
*24:17.800- 24:24.480* :  dawn on those who rely on the courts to police parties that this policy doesn't work, that when
*24:24.480- 24:29.100* :  you disqualify parties, they can emerge stronger at the end of it and that may well happen in
*24:29.100- 24:34.360* :  move forward's case. The party is playing a long game, it's young, it's key members are young,
*24:34.360- 24:40.140* :  it's appeal is still very strong in Thailand and I think their view will be simply to keep bashing
*24:40.140- 24:46.760* :  away, telling Thai people, it is the only party, fully in favour of real changes in the country
*24:46.760- 24:51.520* :  and there is an appetite for that change here. There will hold on in the hope that the next election
*24:51.520- 24:57.180* :  which is in just three years time, they will have a chance to show that the public still supports
*24:57.980- 25:05.100* :  Jonathan Head. Police in central India say at least 13 Maoist rebels have been killed and
*25:05.100- 25:10.600* :  a dozen wounded in a clash weeks ahead of the general election in the state of Chattisgarh.
*25:10.860- 25:15.500* :  The authorities say the gunfight took place in the district of Bijapur, it takes the number
*25:15.500- 25:21.720* :  of Maoists killed this year in India's long running conflict of 50. I asked our South Asia
*25:21.720- 25:27.700* :  regional editor and barrison at a Russian in Delhi what sparked the latest clash. Officials are
*25:27.700- 25:34.180* :  saying that they were conducting anti-insurgency operations ahead of the elections starting on
*25:34.180- 25:40.300* :  the 19th of April and this particular area and this attack they say they've also recovered a
*25:40.300- 25:47.240* :  huge cache of weapons including a light machine gun. This also shows that how volatile the situation
*25:47.240- 25:54.020* :  in these areas even though the Maoist insurgency, the intensity has come down in recent years.
*25:54.620- 26:01.780* :  Ambassador, what are the insurgency fighting for here? This Maoist insurgency started in the 1960s
*26:01.780- 26:06.360* :  they were also called as nexilites and they say they're the fighting for the rights of the
*26:06.360- 26:12.420* :  indigenous communities, the rural poor and the peasants and what they say is that big corporations
*26:12.480- 26:18.380* :  they come to these mineral richer regions of Chattisgarh state, Jarkhand and they take these
*26:18.380- 26:24.360* :  minerals, build a dam, displace people and these indigenous communities do not get anything in
*26:24.360- 26:30.040* :  return so they are what they say is they are waging a war against the Indian state and they have
*26:30.040- 26:35.820* :  been asking the government to focus on development. The Indian authorities for decades for various
*26:35.820- 26:42.220* :  governments not only this current government have been putting more soldiers and more police forces
*26:42.300- 26:47.420* :  in the last one decade or so, the intensity has come down mainly because people are also
*26:47.420- 26:52.600* :  migrating for better opportunities from these areas but some of these hardcore Maoist rebels
*26:52.600- 26:57.300* :  still there and that is why once in a while this kind of fighting happens.
*26:57.900- 27:04.600* :  And Barassan Etterajan with that report. British police say three suspects wanted in connection
*27:04.600- 27:09.800* :  with the stabbing of an Iranian journalist in London left the UK within hours of the attack
*27:09.820- 27:16.560* :  36-year-old Puria Zerati was stabbed outside his home on Friday afternoon. He's now been discharged
*27:16.560- 27:22.000* :  from hospital. We heard more from Tom Simons. What there's established is that the victim was
*27:22.160- 27:27.240* :  approached and that's Puria Zerati a prominent presenter at Iran International which has been
*27:27.240- 27:32.460* :  targeted before for political reasons. They've established that he was approached by two men in a
*27:32.460- 27:38.120* :  residential street in Wimbledon. He was then attacked with a knife. The suspects were driven
*27:38.120- 27:44.700* :  away from the scene in a vehicle at a blue Mazda 3 driven by a third person and now that was
*27:44.700- 27:49.300* :  found abandoned a few miles away in the new Maldon area and then police appeared to have tracked
*27:49.300- 27:54.860* :  these three suspects to Heathrow Airport where as we said they left the UK that's within a few
*27:54.860- 28:01.720* :  hours of the attack. Now another key question is what the explanation for this attack is. The
*28:01.720- 28:07.380* :  Met is not saying it says it actually doesn't know at this stage and is pursuing all lines of inquiry
*28:07.380- 28:14.320* :  and keeping an open mind on any potential motivation for the attack. You can see from the narrative
*28:14.320- 28:19.560* :  that I've just set out there that this did look to have been quite well planned and so I think
*28:19.560- 28:26.240* :  high up in the police's minds will be the possibility of some sort of an attack to terrorise
*28:26.340- 28:32.200* :  the journalists. I have asked the Metropolitan Police where these two have gone to and also
*28:32.200- 28:37.240* :  which international partners the Met said it's liaising with international policing partners.
*28:37.240- 28:41.980* :  The police are not saying at the moment they've clearly made quite a lot of progress in this
*28:41.980- 28:47.140* :  investigation known out using CCTV tracking people across London in the ways that they can these
*28:47.140- 28:52.300* :  days but as to this more political aspect of the investigation currently they are not saying.
*28:53.380- 29:00.840* :  Tom Simons. That's end with an old BBC World Service joke. It's 9 o'clock Greenwich.
*29:01.420- 29:08.500* :  Meantime here is the news. Well today's news is that we can update that to moon time not
*29:08.500- 29:13.940* :  Greenwich though and strictly speaking lunar rather than moon and that's because the US government
*29:13.940- 29:19.780* :  has asked the space agency NASA to work with international agencies and devise a new way
*29:19.780- 29:24.200* :  of keeping track of time on the moon. Stephanie Zacherson has the details.
*29:25.620- 29:31.120* :  At the tone 20 hours 48 minutes coordinated universal time.
*29:35.000- 29:40.360* :  If you're living down here on earth with the rest of us the time where you are is tied to
*29:40.360- 29:48.400* :  coordinated universal time or UTC but in space times a bit different. The moon's gravity is
*29:48.400- 29:54.580* :  different to us and the days are much longer. When astronauts are on a mission they have
*29:54.580- 30:00.460* :  to adapt to a lot of different time zones depending on which country's flag they've got embroidered
*30:00.460- 30:06.200* :  on their suit. Former astronaut Mike Massimino told NBC it can get confusing.
*30:06.200- 30:11.680* :  On the space station because it was controlled with control centers around the world
*30:11.680- 30:18.020* :  because of that they decided to have one time zone that would be for the space station
*30:18.020- 30:22.280* :  and that is universal time. As more and more countries and private companies
*30:22.280- 30:27.680* :  are looking to explore space and with dozens of moon missions planned for the coming decade
*30:28.300- 30:33.800* :  agencies have raised the need for an international standard in how to tell time on and around
*30:33.800- 30:39.660* :  the lunar surface. NASA has now been asked by the White Tiles to set a lunar time standard.
*30:40.260- 30:46.020* :  In a memo sent to the agency it says that it's imperative for the safety and accuracy of missions.
*30:46.800- 30:52.800* :  The US is planning to return humans to the moon and establish a scientific lunar base that
*30:52.800- 30:59.560* :  could help set the stage for future missions to Mars. The European Space Agency last year also
*30:59.560- 31:06.160* :  said this new era of space exploration would require its own time zone saying that there needs
*31:06.160- 31:11.580* :  to be a precise way to tell the exact time to ensure safe navigation on the moon.
*31:12.260- 31:16.580* :  Otherwise it warned docking spacecraft could tumble into each other
*31:16.940- 31:22.840* :  or astronauts might get lost on the lunar surface and with multiple missions coming up
*31:22.840- 31:28.720* :  they'd need to communicate together and fix their positions independently from the Earth.
*31:32.600- 31:38.340* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new addition of the Global News podcast
*31:38.340- 31:43.940* :  later. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it you can send us an

*32:12.440- 32:17.880* :  The information spaces we inhabit can resemble a whole of mirrors. It's called guided
*32:17.880- 32:22.820* :  democracy or managed democracy. There are different parties, different candidates but
*32:22.820- 32:28.620* :  everyone knows who is going to win. The Global Jigsaw is the podcast helping you make sense of them.
*32:28.920- 32:33.420* :  We've seen a crackdown on the opposition we've seen an increase in censorship.
