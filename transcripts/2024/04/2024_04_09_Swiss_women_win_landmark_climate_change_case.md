*00:16.120- 00:16.860* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*00:16.860- 00:21.580* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.580- 00:22.920* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.920- 00:23.940* :  They said yes.
*00:24.320- 00:28.340* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*00:28.340- 00:30.700* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*00:30.740- 00:32.320* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.

*00:50.980- 00:51.920* :  And also the problem.
*00:51.920- 00:55.540* :  And I knew that there is a way we can use technology to solve it.
*00:55.760- 00:58.840* :  People fixing the world from the BBC World Service.
*01:04.760- 01:07.860* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:09.780- 01:13.960* :  I'm Andrew Peechon at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday, the 9th of April.
*01:13.960- 01:15.340* :  These are our main stories.
*01:15.340- 01:21.860* :  A group of elderly Swiss women wins a landmark climate change case in the European Court of Human Rights.
*01:22.480- 01:24.660* :  This on the same day as global temperatures,
*01:24.660- 01:26.960* :  break records for 10 months in a row.
*01:27.640- 01:31.460* :  27 people go on trial and connection with the Panama paper scandal.
*01:33.880- 01:34.780* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:34.780- 01:38.140* :  Tomas throws the latest ceasefire negotiations into doubt,
*01:38.140- 01:40.400* :  saying Israel is ignoring its demands.
*01:41.100- 01:45.660* :  And the makers of Scrabble have done some research and found that younger people
*01:46.080- 01:48.540* :  don't quite like the competitive nature of Scrabble.
*01:48.720- 01:52.160* :  They want a game where you would simply enjoy words and language
*01:52.180- 01:54.440* :  and being together and having fun, creating words.
*01:54.700- 01:56.760* :  A new version of an old-word game.
*02:00.700- 02:04.000* :  First, it's a ruling with potentially world-wide repercussions.
*02:04.060- 02:09.080* :  Europe's top human rights court has ruled in favor of a group of elderly Swiss women
*02:09.080- 02:14.700* :  who said their government violated their human rights by not doing enough to combat climate change.
*02:15.380- 02:18.720* :  Dozens of supporters of the Swiss women were in court to hear the outcome,
*02:19.220- 02:21.540* :  including the environmental campaigner Greta Tunberg.
*02:22.100- 02:24.840* :  People have been living on the front lines of the climate emergency
*02:24.840- 02:29.760* :  and have been witnessing and bearing the brunt of its consequences for a very long time.
*02:30.040- 02:32.180* :  This is not a future threat we're talking about here.
*02:32.180- 02:36.960* :  It's a current planetary emergency where hundreds of thousands of people are being affected.
*02:36.960- 02:40.480* :  Are losing their homes, are becoming climate refugees, are losing their lives,
*02:40.500- 02:43.060* :  suffering severe health catastrophes.
*02:43.540- 02:46.960* :  The Swiss president, Violet M. Hertz, said the ruling did nothing to change
*02:46.960- 02:51.320* :  her government's commitment to sustainability by the diversity and net zero.
*02:51.860- 02:55.600* :  I asked our correspondent, Imogen Fox, exactly what today's ruling says.
*02:56.380- 02:59.660* :  The fundamental part of this judgment,
*03:00.200- 03:03.740* :  which is what, in fact, the Swiss women who brought their particular gaze
*03:03.740- 03:08.880* :  were looking for was that the court make a link between climate change
*03:08.880- 03:13.540* :  or more specifically failure to do enough to tackle it and human rights.
*03:13.540- 03:15.860* :  And the court has done precisely that.
*03:15.980- 03:20.380* :  What it said is that the Swiss government's lack of action
*03:20.380- 03:25.660* :  on tackling greenhouse gas emissions has violated people's rights.
*03:25.660- 03:28.500* :  What this quite specific threat, private and family life,
*03:28.500- 03:32.940* :  but what it refers to is the records these Swiss women brought to the court,
*03:32.940- 03:38.000* :  which showed that they were having to stay indoors alone for days and weeks on end,
*03:38.380- 03:42.640* :  not seeing their families or grandchildren during these extreme heat waves,
*03:42.640- 03:45.080* :  which it's wanted to see more and more of.
*03:45.160- 03:51.360* :  The fundamental thing you're not doing enough and climate change is linked to human rights.
*03:51.740- 03:54.260* :  I think that will have repercussions read across Europe.
*03:54.440- 03:57.800* :  So does this put some kind of legal obligation on the Swiss government
*03:57.800- 04:01.120* :  and bi-implication of the governments to combat climate change,
*04:01.120- 04:02.640* :  to reduce global temperatures?
*04:03.080- 04:05.580* :  Switzerland cannot appeal this ruling,
*04:05.900- 04:11.380* :  and it has been told that its current strategy is inadequate
*04:11.380- 04:16.620* :  that it has not properly shown its workings about what it's actually doing
*04:16.620- 04:20.720* :  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that it has not met its targets.
*04:21.160- 04:24.960* :  So this isn't is now a blide to do something about that.
*04:24.960- 04:28.840* :  And for other countries in Europe, it sets a precedent
*04:28.860- 04:32.640* :  because it is the very first time that the European Court of Human Rights
*04:33.080- 04:35.820* :  has ruled on a climate change case like this.
*04:35.960- 04:37.200* :  We know that in other courts,
*04:37.200- 04:39.320* :  there are similar cases coming down the line,
*04:39.400- 04:43.860* :  but the fact that the court has told today a member state,
*04:43.900- 04:49.400* :  one which many people think has a stellar record in environmental matters,
*04:49.400- 04:54.120* :  that it's not doing enough and that it's therefore violating the rights of its own citizens,
*04:54.760- 04:56.080* :  is really quite historic.
*04:56.560- 04:59.740* :  We're talking about some other cases being heard by the same court.
*04:59.740- 05:01.380* :  They were ruled in admissible.
*05:01.840- 05:04.460* :  That's right, there was one from Portuguese young people,
*05:04.460- 05:06.700* :  but what the European Court said is, look,
*05:06.860- 05:12.060* :  what you needed to do these young people is go through your own domestic courts
*05:12.060- 05:13.240* :  in Portugal first.
*05:13.320- 05:16.600* :  The Swiss women went right through the Swiss legal system
*05:16.600- 05:18.500* :  before they ended up in Strasbourg.
*05:18.900- 05:21.720* :  The other case from France was an individual concern
*05:21.720- 05:27.120* :  to no longer lives where he made the complaint related to climate change and flooding.
*05:27.540- 05:29.460* :  So that was ruled in admissible as well.
*05:29.660- 05:31.240* :  I correspond to image in folks.
*05:31.740- 05:36.040* :  The ruling came as new figures show the world has experienced record breaking heat
*05:36.040- 05:37.640* :  for 10 months in a row.
*05:38.080- 05:42.460* :  The EU's climate change service said March was the warmest ever recorded
*05:42.860- 05:47.720* :  with temperatures now at 1.68 degrees higher than before industrial times
*05:47.780- 05:51.580* :  and the rise in the temperature of the sea surface even more dramatic.
*05:51.980- 05:54.120* :  Samantha Burgess says it's a worrying trend.
*05:54.760- 05:57.760* :  These records are telling us that our climate is warming,
*05:57.780- 06:02.080* :  it's warming rapidly and climate change isn't a future problem,
*06:02.080- 06:05.100* :  is a present problem impacting everyone around the world.
*06:05.480- 06:07.540* :  So what's driving this record breaking heat?
*06:07.540- 06:09.700* :  Matt McGraw is our environment correspondent.
*06:10.380- 06:14.240* :  It's the long term use of fossil fuels deforestation,
*06:14.240- 06:15.840* :  human activities, if you like,
*06:15.840- 06:18.580* :  driving up levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
*06:19.180- 06:23.180* :  that is warming our planet, that is the underlying and overlying cause as well.
*06:23.180- 06:28.040* :  But this has also been aided and abetted by an El Niño weather phenomenon
*06:28.040- 06:29.920* :  and it's a naturally occurring event in the Pacific,
*06:29.920- 06:33.020* :  which sees large amounts of heat come from the seas to the skies.
*06:33.020- 06:36.340* :  That's been running now for about a year, it's peaked in December
*06:36.900- 06:39.300* :  and it has added a fraction to the tougher,
*06:39.300- 06:43.980* :  that which is why we're seeing this long-term run of record months dating back to last June.
*06:44.140- 06:48.760* :  Give me a sense of the impact that these rising temperatures are already having
*06:48.760- 06:50.020* :  in different parts of the world.
*06:50.020- 06:52.120* :  At a low-now phase, what might follow?
*06:52.360- 06:54.640* :  One of the biggest impacts that people are seeing around the world
*06:54.640- 06:58.640* :  is how warm the seas are and that is leading on to many other problems.
*06:58.740- 07:03.220* :  But the seas are so warm at this particular time that they are really breaking records
*07:03.220- 07:04.420* :  in unprecedented way.
*07:04.440- 07:07.860* :  The seas at the moment in March where the warmest they've ever been.
*07:08.560- 07:10.140* :  And that can lead to greater storms.
*07:10.140- 07:14.160* :  People are worried about the potential for hurricanes and tropical storms
*07:14.160- 07:16.780* :  during the later part of the summer and into the autumn
*07:17.100- 07:18.840* :  because the seas contain such heat.
*07:18.840- 07:21.880* :  But we're also seeing a lot of rainfall in various places
*07:21.940- 07:23.860* :  and this is another impact of climate change
*07:23.860- 07:28.620* :  because the greater the warming, the more moisture can be held in the skies if you like.
*07:28.660- 07:30.460* :  And that then falls as very heavy rainfall.
*07:30.460- 07:34.760* :  In fact, 67 percent of the world had greater than average moisture throughout March
*07:34.760- 07:36.940* :  as well. So we're seeing greater heat, we're seeing greater moisture
*07:37.400- 07:39.220* :  and there's concerns about storms into the future.
*07:39.380- 07:41.680* :  We're pretty used to hearing these climate warnings now.
*07:41.680- 07:45.360* :  Scientists are saying, hang on a minute, we're now in uncharted territory.
*07:45.360- 07:48.040* :  What do they mean? What are they concerned about now?
*07:48.560- 07:51.780* :  The big worry here from scientists that we've spoken to is that
*07:51.780- 07:56.340* :  while we're in an El Niño at the moment, it's expected to fade over the next four or five
*07:56.340- 08:00.560* :  months and re-replace by a land Niño which sees colder water come to the surface
*08:00.860- 08:01.720* :  and cool temperatures.
*08:01.940- 08:05.460* :  They're worried that if the drop in temperatures that we experienced later this year
*08:05.460- 08:09.920* :  isn't sufficient, then something fundamentally different may be happening in the climate
*08:09.920- 08:13.700* :  and we may be in a period of far faster and more dangerous warming.
*08:13.700- 08:17.420* :  But that is all to play for. They will be watching the temperatures very closely
*08:17.880- 08:19.300* :  from June, July, August onwards.
*08:19.300- 08:22.540* :  If there's a significant dip, they'll say it's climate change as we know it.
*08:22.740- 08:26.140* :  If there's not a significant dip, they'll say we may be in a different place.
*08:26.800- 08:28.560* :  Our environment corresponded map and graph.
*08:29.160- 08:34.000* :  Back in 2016, a huge leak of more than 11 million financial documents lifted the lid
*08:34.000- 08:38.100* :  on how the rich and powerful use tax havens to hide their wealth.
*08:38.580- 08:41.120* :  The files became known as the Panama Papers.
*08:41.580- 08:46.140* :  Now, 27 people have gone on trial in Panama City in connection with the scandal.
*08:46.640- 08:50.280* :  Alex Richardson found out more from our South America correspondent Ioni Wells.
*08:51.020- 08:55.060* :  These documents revealed that clients of this law firm were able to
*08:55.500- 08:59.800* :  launder money, were able to dodge sanctions, were able to avoid tax
*09:00.440- 09:04.920* :  through using sort of shell companies and offshore financing to essentially stash away
*09:05.180- 09:06.400* :  money that they were making.
*09:06.400- 09:11.620* :  Now, while some offshore business and sees are legal, there are some legitimate uses for them.
*09:12.000- 09:15.540* :  What this leak specifically revealed through some of the journalistic work that was
*09:15.540- 09:19.560* :  accompanying it was that some of these companies were being used for illegal purposes,
*09:19.560- 09:21.920* :  fraud, dodging sanctions, etc.
*09:22.540- 09:27.300* :  And some of the people named in this leak were incredibly sort of powerful people,
*09:27.300- 09:31.940* :  members of government or heads of state, including from Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine,
*09:32.700- 09:35.600* :  some sports stars and FIFA kind of named as well.
*09:35.700- 09:41.380* :  Also, there was a sort of suspected billion dollar laundering ring that was named involving
*09:41.380- 09:44.000* :  close associates of the Russian President Putin.
*09:44.000- 09:48.340* :  So, lots of very rich, wealthy and powerful people were exposed as part of that leak.
*09:48.640- 09:53.180* :  And the founders of this law firm, Massac Fonseca, are on trial.
*09:53.840- 09:56.380* :  What are they and others charged with doing here?
*09:56.620- 09:59.600* :  So, Massac and Fonseca are two individuals as well,
*09:59.760- 10:05.480* :  the founders of that law firm and they are a part of 27 people in total who are on trial
*10:06.000- 10:07.380* :  in this Panamanian court.
*10:07.400- 10:11.540* :  And they are accused essentially of money laundering, of allowing people to cleanse
*10:11.540- 10:15.380* :  money obtained in illegal ways through offshore financing.
*10:15.900- 10:19.620* :  Now, if they are found guilty, they could face about 12 years in prison.
*10:20.220- 10:22.440* :  The law firm that they ran is now closed.
*10:22.580- 10:26.900* :  They actually decided to shut it down, citing reputational damage at the time,
*10:26.900- 10:30.340* :  and citing kind of action that was taken by the Panamanian authorities at the time.
*10:30.340- 10:36.020* :  They, up until this day, have still denied that the firm and its owners and its employees
*10:36.680- 10:38.560* :  engage with any kind of unlawful acts.
*10:38.560- 10:41.700* :  But that is what this case that is happening now, will determine.
*10:41.700- 10:47.860* :  What's this case going to do for Panamar's perceived status as a tax haven
*10:47.860- 10:50.820* :  because the case itself is in Panamar City, isn't it?
*10:51.120- 10:55.340* :  That's right. I mean, I think Panamar were actually rather frustrated by this whole leak
*10:55.340- 10:58.440* :  because of the name. It was given, the nickname, the Panamar papers.
*10:58.720- 10:59.900* :  They weren't particularly happy with that.
*10:59.900- 11:02.580* :  They made the case at the time that this was just one law firm.
*11:03.060- 11:05.720* :  They weren't particularly happy with the fact that the whole country was sort of
*11:05.720- 11:07.280* :  being dragged down with it.
*11:07.340- 11:11.640* :  Now, that being said, a lot of the offshore finance that was exposed as part of this leak
*11:11.640- 11:16.200* :  did include cell companies that were registered in Panamar in the Virgin Islands, for example,
*11:16.200- 11:18.820* :  as well, hence the nickname that it was given.
*11:18.880- 11:22.900* :  But I think this is certainly an attempt to show that the country is cracking down on
*11:23.460- 11:25.100* :  its perception as a tax haven.
*11:25.100- 11:29.780* :  It is investigating those who have been accused of being involved in some of these
*11:29.960- 11:31.340* :  money laundering accusations.
*11:31.380- 11:36.740* :  And I think this kind of speaks to a wider picture that shows what an impact this leak had
*11:36.740- 11:39.920* :  because it's not just in Panamar that investigations have been taking place.
*11:39.920- 11:42.700* :  They have been taking place across the world, really.
*11:42.700- 11:47.300* :  There's been cases in the UK, for example, where investigations were carried out after
*11:47.300- 11:50.000* :  that leak exposed certain individuals, certain companies.
*11:50.640- 11:53.760* :  Some of the individuals accused, as I say, have been facing justice around the world.
*11:53.760- 11:57.520* :  And some decided to really step down from roles themselves,
*11:57.520- 12:01.700* :  including Iceland's former Prime Minister who was named in the leak and decided to
*12:01.700- 12:03.760* :  step down after protests against him.
*12:04.420- 12:06.620* :  Our South America correspondent, Ioni Wells.
*12:07.300- 12:11.780* :  Driverless vehicles are much talked about around the world, but South Korea is one of
*12:11.780- 12:14.460* :  only a small number of countries, which allows them on the roads.
*12:14.460- 12:18.640* :  In fact, they've now got a fleet of night buses, which drive themselves.
*12:19.180- 12:20.380* :  Nick Marsh is in Seoul.
*12:22.120- 12:23.180* :  Midnight in Seoul.
*12:23.800- 12:27.640* :  And there's a million dollars worth of technology cruising the streets.
*12:31.340- 12:38.120* :  This is one of the world's first driverless buses to get a public route through a major city.
*12:39.020- 12:40.240* :  Yeah, it's exactly the same.
*12:40.580- 12:41.760* :  It's like a normal bus drive.
*12:41.760- 12:42.580* :  It's not driving.
*12:42.580- 12:44.140* :  The driver's not touching the steering wheel.
*12:44.200- 12:44.820* :  No, not at all.
*12:45.720- 12:47.580* :  There are some caveats.
*12:48.100- 12:49.180* :  It's a night bus.
*12:49.620- 12:50.700* :  You have to wear a seatbelt.
*12:51.280- 12:54.500* :  And technically, there is a driver sitting behind the wheel,
*12:54.840- 12:56.620* :  just in case anything goes wrong.
*12:57.480- 13:01.040* :  The funny thing is, I thought that seeing that would panic me.
*13:01.660- 13:02.320* :  But it doesn't.
*13:03.060- 13:06.120* :  There's been a couple of moments when he's had to take control of the wheel,
*13:06.620- 13:11.160* :  but by and large, this is as smooth as any regular bus that you'll take.
*13:13.720- 13:16.380* :  These late-night travelers seem to enjoy themselves.
*13:17.320- 13:21.140* :  Since there's also a bus driver sitting at the front, I feel a little bit more safe.
*13:21.480- 13:25.980* :  It's a late-night bus, so it can ease the burden and the bus drivers.
*13:29.980- 13:35.460* :  South Korea is one of only a handful of countries to allow autonomous vehicles on its roads.
*13:37.360- 13:41.560* :  And it's already spent hundreds of millions of dollars to advance the technology.
*13:44.040- 13:48.280* :  South Korea is showing that driverless public transport does work,
*13:49.080- 13:53.860* :  but only in limited circumstances and at considerable cost.
*13:54.780- 13:58.060* :  If this is an infrastructure that will make cities more efficient,
*13:58.920- 14:01.040* :  then there's still a long road ahead.
*14:01.940- 14:03.460* :  Nick Marsh reporting from Seoul.
*14:05.020- 14:10.140* :  Still to come, we hear more about the impact of climate change in Tsimbabwe and southern Russia.
*14:10.560- 14:10.880* :  And?
*14:11.200- 14:14.540* :  Australia is no stranger to obscure looking animals,
*14:14.540- 14:18.680* :  but these guys are kind of cute and alien looking at the same time.
*14:18.920- 14:21.660* :  The rare mall spotted in the Australian Outback.
*14:29.440- 14:33.500* :  The Global Jigsaw is the podcast looking at the world through the lens of its media.
*14:33.760- 14:36.420* :  Stay medium now, which topics they can and can't discuss.
*14:36.840- 14:41.120* :  We fill gaps and connect dots to better understand what's happening in the world.
*14:41.400- 14:43.060* :  It's important to remember the context.
*14:43.420- 14:46.740* :  An untangled and narratives aimed at influencing your views.
*14:47.160- 14:48.160* :  Tightly controlled.
*14:48.160- 14:50.820* :  It's not so healthy to be a journalist there.
*14:51.420- 14:53.740* :  The Global Jigsaw from the BBC World Service.
*14:54.320- 14:58.760* :  Listen now by searching for the explanation wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*15:07.500- 15:12.240* :  A day after the Qataris expressed a note of optimism about a possible cease-fire in Gaza,
*15:12.720- 15:15.980* :  Hamas have thrown the latest round of talks in Cairo into doubt.
*15:15.980- 15:20.840* :  Meanwhile, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there's now a date
*15:20.840- 15:23.500* :  for the offensive in Raffa in southern Gaza.
*15:24.000- 15:27.160* :  The population there has swelled to more than one and a half million people
*15:27.540- 15:31.240* :  after Palestinians moved south to escape airstrikes in the north.
*15:31.240- 15:35.140* :  Gada Uda is a freelance journalist who spoke to us from Raffa.
*15:35.560- 15:40.460* :  It's been like six months now and we are every time we are evacuating from a bliss to bliss.
*15:40.500- 15:43.060* :  For me, like I'm evacuating for seven times.
*15:43.060- 15:45.780* :  So shall I start from the beginning?
*15:45.780- 15:49.980* :  And there is like a crisis in a humanitarian situation in Gaza.
*15:50.440- 15:54.240* :  It was so difficult to find food, water, and to secure your supplies.
*15:54.240- 16:00.380* :  But to start from the beginning, again, it's so difficult and the economic situation here,
*16:00.380- 16:02.920* :  especially in Raffa, it's very difficult.
*16:02.920- 16:09.480* :  We will stay in Raffa until there will be like a political solution in the upcoming few days.
*16:10.120- 16:12.120* :  Hugo Vashegar is in Jerusalem for us.
*16:12.140- 16:15.060* :  First, the latest on those stalled cease-fire talks.
*16:15.860- 16:21.140* :  Yesterday we had the Qataris who had been mediating these talks and even the Israeli
*16:21.140- 16:26.000* :  Foreign Minister saying that there was cautious optimism that they could reach a deal.
*16:26.440- 16:31.660* :  But now Hamas is saying that the deal on the table doesn't really meet our demands.
*16:31.660- 16:34.080* :  And they have three main demands.
*16:34.080- 16:36.640* :  They want a permanent cease-fire.
*16:36.800- 16:42.380* :  They want all Israeli troops out of Gaza and they also want displaced residents to be allowed
*16:42.380- 16:44.120* :  to return to northern Gaza.
*16:44.660- 16:49.120* :  Now, the Israelis having the past rejected those demands as unacceptable.
*16:49.120- 16:52.760* :  But there is a lot of pressure for a deal, especially from the Americans.
*16:52.760- 16:56.540* :  You know, the head of the CIA is there in Cairo for talks.
*16:57.280- 16:59.120* :  So there is a lot of pressure from the Americans.
*16:59.120- 17:04.020* :  And here in Israel, there is a lot of pressure from the families of the hostages on the Prime Minister
*17:04.020- 17:09.560* :  to accept a deal with Hamas because they say that this is the only way to save
*17:09.560- 17:12.460* :  the hostages who remain in captivity.
*17:12.460- 17:16.160* :  What is also interesting is that he's also facing pressure from some of his
*17:16.640- 17:21.620* :  hard-line allies in his coalition who are against the idea of making concessions.
*17:21.620- 17:25.020* :  So I think this shows how difficult these negotiations are.
*17:25.380- 17:30.360* :  And Hugo, the Israelis have always been definite about going into Raffa.
*17:30.500- 17:33.520* :  There's huge international pressure on them not to.
*17:33.980- 17:36.920* :  We saw forces pull back over the weekend.
*17:37.500- 17:39.940* :  And now we've got a date for the Raffa invasion.
*17:39.940- 17:46.000* :  Is that illustrative of Benjamin Netanyahu needing to please his coalition partners
*17:46.000- 17:50.140* :  and sway to an extent the pressure he's being put under in Jerusalem?
*17:50.520- 17:52.020* :  I think that's exactly the case.
*17:52.020- 17:55.520* :  I think some hard-line members of his government are saying,
*17:55.520- 18:01.260* :  look, if you and the war without an offensive against Hamas in Raffa,
*18:01.380- 18:02.880* :  you are going to lose our support.
*18:02.880- 18:07.860* :  Prime Minister Netanyahu is trying to appeal to these hard-line members of his coalition,
*18:08.620- 18:10.260* :  saying, well, look, we're going to do it.
*18:10.260- 18:14.540* :  We're going to launch this major offensive against Hamas in Raffa.
*18:14.860- 18:17.160* :  But again, there is a lot of opposition to that.
*18:17.160- 18:23.540* :  I think almost everyone outside Israel is against the idea of launching a military offensive
*18:24.240- 18:28.420* :  against Hamas in Raffa because this is where more than a million Palestinians are sheltering.
*18:28.880- 18:34.020* :  And the Americans in particular are very concerned that this could lead to a humanitarian disaster.
*18:34.020- 18:37.440* :  Now, the Israelis say they have a plan to evacuate civilians.
*18:37.440- 18:40.680* :  The Americans have lots of questions about this plan.
*18:41.180- 18:47.200* :  They think that the Israelis should carry out targeted operations against Hamas in Raffa
*18:47.340- 18:54.840* :  instead of launching a major offensive that would inevitably lead to another mass displacement
*18:54.840- 18:55.600* :  of civilians.
*18:56.040- 19:00.440* :  And again, the warnings are that any kind of major military operation in Raffa
*19:00.740- 19:03.560* :  could have disastrous consequences for the civilians there.
*19:04.060- 19:05.380* :  Hugo Bachega in Jerusalem.
*19:06.100- 19:10.220* :  Let's get more now on the warning that the latest climate change figures could signal a new phase
*19:10.220- 19:11.520* :  in global warming.
*19:12.080- 19:16.300* :  In recent months, countries around the world have experienced unseasonably high temperatures,
*19:16.300- 19:18.200* :  flooding, and wildfires.
*19:18.760- 19:24.080* :  Last week, Zimbabwe's president declared a national disaster because of prolonged drought there.
*19:24.540- 19:27.880* :  It fires similar announcements in neighboring Zambia and Malawi.
*19:28.660- 19:31.060* :  Symmetar Symmetar is a farmer in Zambia.
*19:31.980- 19:35.660* :  I think in the last eight weeks, it has only rained one day.
*19:35.660- 19:44.560* :  It's really impacting us and I was very, very happy and elated when our president announced
*19:44.580- 19:47.840* :  that he had declared a disaster.
*19:48.580- 19:52.300* :  It is for the first time in these eight years I've been here.
*19:52.760- 20:00.680* :  I have seen milling mill from town millers being sold in this area that I have never seen
*20:00.680- 20:03.300* :  before. In fact, when I arrived, I used to ask,
*20:03.860- 20:07.760* :  you people don't buy milling mill from town because they were self-reland.
*20:08.460- 20:09.800* :  So it's huge.
*20:11.040- 20:17.780* :  We do not suffer power outages simply because there is no electricity here
*20:18.240- 20:19.820* :  from the national grid.
*20:20.100- 20:22.240* :  We rely on solar electricity.
*20:22.620- 20:26.060* :  There are very, very few of us, I think less than two percent.
*20:26.540- 20:29.500* :  The rest have to do without it.
*20:30.280- 20:37.680* :  Communication is difficult because mobile phone services are erratic.
*20:38.460- 20:45.240* :  I have to drive 10 kilometers from my house to the best place I can catch an opportunity to
*20:45.240- 20:50.780* :  give this recording. We are coping. We are survivors, but it's difficult for us.
*20:51.520- 20:56.080* :  Zimbabwe once, the bread basket of southern Africa, is now facing food scarcity.
*20:56.620- 20:58.500* :  Ashinga Mioka in Harari explains.
*20:59.360- 21:06.560* :  I think it's just the scale of the crop failure from what we've heard and what's evident
*21:06.560- 21:13.900* :  everywhere that you go around the country is just the amount of crops that just could not
*21:13.900- 21:19.020* :  withstand the heat, the searing heat, as well as the lack of rain.
*21:19.020- 21:25.440* :  A lot of people are referring to the drought in 1992, which was the worst drought in living
*21:25.440- 21:32.040* :  memory. We're not quite there yet, because obviously this is the beginning of the hunger season,
*21:32.880- 21:37.660* :  but definitely a lot worse than the previous droughts that we've seen over the last couple of
*21:37.660- 21:42.720* :  years. I wonder if the government has the range to do anything to address the crisis.
*21:43.280- 21:44.560* :  What can it do? What has it done?
*21:45.120- 21:51.800* :  I think the first step is what the president did when he declared a national disaster.
*21:52.380- 21:58.820* :  By his own admission, this allows the government to mobilize money and to also divert money
*21:58.820- 22:05.400* :  towards making a plan. He outlined some of the things that they want to do because of the
*22:05.400- 22:12.660* :  shortfall in the maze. They want to import grain. They also want to pause the plan to export grain
*22:12.660- 22:19.860* :  to countries like Rwanda. They want to expand the winter crop in the coming months and also to try
*22:19.860- 22:26.540* :  to get aid. According to the government, it believes that it needs about $2 billion US dollars
*22:27.060- 22:33.120* :  from Zimbabweans living abroad, from aid organisations and other well wishes to be able to
*22:33.120- 22:39.800* :  deal with this problem. That's a huge amount. You asked whether the government has the range
*22:39.800- 22:45.100* :  to be able to help the factors that Zimbabwe's economy is in a mess that has been for many,
*22:45.100- 22:50.800* :  many years and so it's not as resilient as it has been in the past. For example, in 1992,
*22:50.800- 22:59.800* :  when we had the worst drought then, but there really is a grim outlook in terms of how people are
*22:59.800- 23:06.960* :  going to be able to find food. I think the concern is about the impact of hunger on ordinary
*23:06.960- 23:12.700* :  Zimbabweans, the communal farmers which make up the majority of the people in this country.
*23:12.700- 23:18.820* :  They live hand to mouth and what they produce is what they sell to be able to send their children
*23:18.820- 23:24.880* :  to school, to be able to attend to their health needs. Without all of that money, even though
*23:24.880- 23:29.620* :  they might be getting food aid, it might have an impact on whether children will be in school,
*23:29.620- 23:36.780* :  on whether they can feed their own animals. In 1992, a million animals died that was about a quarter
*23:36.780- 23:43.420* :  of Zimbabwe's cattle herd and so there's a real fear that unless government gets all of the food
*23:43.800- 23:49.740* :  supplies that they need, all of the grain that is required to be able to meet the people's needs,
*23:49.740- 23:56.040* :  but also the animals needs that we could see the number of animals cattle dying as a result.
*23:56.040- 24:01.900* :  And cattle equals wealth in this country and so it really has an impact not just in terms of
*24:01.900- 24:04.920* :  putting food in people's stomach, but just on the broader economy.
*24:05.520- 24:10.700* :  Shingai Nyoka, talking to my colleague Alan Kasooja. Meanwhile, thousands more people have been
*24:10.700- 24:15.500* :  evacuated in southern Russia as the region experiences the worst flooding in 70 years.
*24:16.040- 24:20.940* :  People have been staging protests after a dam, which was meant to be a forever solution to the
*24:20.940- 24:26.420* :  problem of flooding broke. About 100,000 people have now been evacuated from their homes in Russia
*24:26.420- 24:29.940* :  and Kazakhstan. Here's our Europe Regional Editor, Paul Moss.
*24:30.800- 24:33.840* :  The words of one Russian regional governor said it all,
*24:33.840- 24:39.900* :  praise God and flee from your homes. Vadim Shumkov was speaking as the city of Korgan became
*24:39.900- 24:45.240* :  the latest to come under threat from flooding. Ork to the southwest is already under water,
*24:45.720- 24:50.000* :  while across the border in Kazakhstan, five regions are in a state of emergency.
*24:50.660- 24:54.240* :  Early snow melt in Siberia and the Ural mountains has been blamed,
*24:54.240- 24:59.520* :  but angry protesters in Orsk complained that local officials hadn't done enough to help.
*24:59.960- 25:03.440* :  Russia's Ministry of Emergency says it's now on high alert.
*25:04.260- 25:09.580* :  An extremely rare mole has been spotted in the Australian outback for the second time in six
*25:09.580- 25:15.480* :  months. This is the northern marsupial mole. It's pretty difficult to spot because it lives underground
*25:15.480- 25:21.420* :  nearly all the time. This one was spotted by some indigenous rangers. The BBC's Tiffany Turnbull
*25:21.420- 25:27.040* :  in Sydney told me what they looked like. Someone I spoke to said these are so rare that he's never
*25:27.040- 25:32.200* :  seen them before, but someone he knows who has thought it was a baby guinea pig when they
*25:32.200- 25:35.940* :  saw it in the wild and they were pretty shocked when they got a little closer and realized that
*25:36.240- 25:41.700* :  actually this had a weird stumpy tail and it had no eyes and it had these weird um,
*25:41.700- 25:48.120* :  slipper-like hands. They're pretty bizarre looking creatures and Australia is no stranger to
*25:48.480- 25:53.500* :  obscure looking animals, but these guys are kind of cute and alien looking at the same time.
*25:53.540- 26:01.860* :  They've got really long silky golden hair. They've got this tiny stumpy tail, no eyes and they've
*26:01.860- 26:08.580* :  got also these strong flipper-like hands which they use to kind of swim through the sand dunes that
*26:08.580- 26:14.220* :  they live in. That's a great description and just give us a sense of the lives they lead because
*26:14.220- 26:19.680* :  what's really unusual about these animals is the habitat they live in and how long they stay on
*26:19.680- 26:24.940* :  the ground. They live in one of the most remote parts of the country. This animal was spotted
*26:24.940- 26:30.880* :  in the Great Sandy Desert, which is about 1,500 kilometres away from Perth in Western Australia.
*26:31.840- 26:36.320* :  These are some of the least populated parts of the country and they live underground. They're
*26:36.320- 26:42.680* :  rarely found on the surface and my understanding is you usually only see marsupial moles a couple
*26:42.680- 26:49.640* :  times a decade. The fact that they've been spotted twice in six months is really interesting and
*26:49.640- 26:54.340* :  sometimes it sounds like good news, but you can learn more about them. Is it worrying in any sense
*26:54.340- 26:59.180* :  that the marsupal moles are coming out more often? We don't actually know the answer to that,
*26:59.480- 27:04.900* :  so because of the fact that these live underground and they are living in such remote areas,
*27:04.900- 27:10.640* :  we don't actually know a lot about marsupial moles. They're really cryptic animals and so it's hard
*27:10.640- 27:15.560* :  to say whether or not the fact that two have been spotted in six months is cause for concern or
*27:15.560- 27:21.960* :  cause for celebration, but researchers say that the sighting is really exciting because it helps us
*27:21.960- 27:27.880* :  learn more about them. And do we know why they choose to spend so much time on the ground?
*27:28.580- 27:35.240* :  Because the desert is such a harsh environment, so many of the animals that live there develop these
*27:35.980- 27:40.520* :  physical and behavioral quirks that kind of allow them to survive. So living underground is
*27:40.520- 27:45.560* :  a huge one. A lot of animals on the desert do spend a lot of time underground just because that's
*27:45.560- 27:50.620* :  the only place they can survive. Tiffany Turnbull with me from Sydney. The company which makes
*27:50.620- 27:56.380* :  Scrabble has launched the first major redesign of the game in 75 years to encourage players who
*27:56.380- 28:01.660* :  find it too intimidating. The classic board game will now be sold with a simpler version printed
*28:01.660- 28:07.200* :  on its underside that demands less knowledge of the dictionary. Players will work in teams to
*28:07.200- 28:12.660* :  compete challenges and use helper cards. Charles Brandruth is president of the Association of
*28:12.660- 28:17.400* :  British Scrabble Players, so what does he think of these changes? This is exciting news.
*28:17.800- 28:25.140* :  I love the game of Scrabble, invented in 1938, promoted in the 1940s, came to Britain in 1953.
*28:25.860- 28:31.280* :  I've been playing it since the 1950s. I founded the National Scrabble Championships in 1971.
*28:31.280- 28:37.560* :  We play the traditional game, but as you should know, change is inevitable and in fact change is
*28:37.560- 28:42.580* :  the salt in the soup of life. And this good news, this exciting news is there's going to be a new
*28:42.580- 28:47.860* :  version of Scrabble. It doesn't deny the old version, but this is going to be a little bit easier.
*28:47.860- 28:53.380* :  It is going to be more inclusive. The makers of Scrabble, Mattel, have done some research and found
*28:53.380- 28:59.740* :  that younger people, Gen Z people don't quite like the competitive nature of Scrabble that unites
*28:59.740- 29:05.800* :  rifle. They want a game where you would simply enjoy words and language and being together and
*29:05.800- 29:11.480* :  having fun creating words. He's losing how you learn, no, Charles. I mean, I learned Scrabble
*29:11.480- 29:18.920* :  when my mum constantly beat me and that's how we learn new words. That is true, but you also,
*29:18.920- 29:23.900* :  you go to the laboratory very successfully now, but you were once potty trail. The point is,
*29:23.900- 29:30.260* :  you've got to begin somewhere. And I think the idea of this is to encourage people who may be
*29:30.260- 29:35.060* :  feel that Scrabble is a bit daunting. And it can be daunting because also now, competitive
*29:35.060- 29:39.780* :  Scrabble players have learned all these rather obscure words. I mean, there's a Scrabble dictionary
*29:39.780- 29:46.920* :  that includes AA as a legitimate word, apparently it's a kind of volcanic lava. Do you ever play
*29:46.920- 29:55.500* :  the word azuleo? No, it's a ULEJO when it's a Spanish porcelain tile. Now, these are real
*29:55.500- 29:59.900* :  enthusiasts who are really playing to score and they're building their vocabulary. And that's great,
*29:59.900- 30:04.220* :  but actually there are newcomers who know that language is found, language is important,
*30:04.600- 30:08.280* :  and who are more, well, they come from a more casual generation. So, cash actually is a
*30:08.280- 30:13.460* :  word that's allowed. So you really? Yeah, yeah. Show me out. Charles, isn't the competition.
*30:13.460- 30:16.720* :  Lisa, I've always felt this. The competition is within yourself, isn't it? It's your first
*30:16.760- 30:21.500* :  situation with yourself that you haven't managed to just do better and to dig deeper into the brain
*30:21.500- 30:25.440* :  and produce a better word. Of course. And if you're like me, you've got all these words in your
*30:25.440- 30:31.060* :  head. Yes, is my favorite Scrabble word. Why ex? Because it uses two very useful letters and you
*30:31.060- 30:35.200* :  can fit it into a corner. Yes, means it's a kind of hiccup. And I've just discovered the word
*30:35.200- 30:41.500* :  bambi, B-A-M-B-I, a born again, middle aged biker. Charles Prandorf, talking to my colleagues,
*30:41.500- 30:47.600* :  Nick Robinson and Michelle Hussain. And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition

*31:26.240- 31:30.540* :  We fill gaps and connect dots to better understand what's happening in the world.
*31:30.780- 31:35.400* :  It's important to remember the context. And untangle the narratives aimed at influencing
*31:35.400- 31:40.240* :  your views. Tightly controlled. It's not so healthy to be a journalist there.
