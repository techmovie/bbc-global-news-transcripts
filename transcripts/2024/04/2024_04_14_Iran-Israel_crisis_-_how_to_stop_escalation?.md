*00:54.660- 00:57.160* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:58.760- 01:03.640* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 12 hours GMT on Sunday the 14th of April, these are our headlines.
*01:04.280- 01:09.440* :  Israel's Prime Minister has been responding to Iran's unprecedented overnight attacks.
*01:10.000- 01:12.240* :  The Israeli Army says it saw off the threat.
*01:12.400- 01:18.220* :  The Iranian threat met the Israeli defence forces, aerial and technological superiority.
*01:18.220- 01:22.480* :  We intercepted 99% of those launched towards Israel's territory.
*01:23.120- 01:25.860* :  This is a very significant strategic achievement.
*01:25.860- 01:28.480* :  Tehran warns Israel more could come.
*01:28.480- 01:33.740* :  If the Zionist regime takes any action against the Islamic Republic, whether on our soil
*01:33.740- 01:39.460* :  or in places belonging to us in Syria or elsewhere, our next operation will be much larger.
*01:39.660- 01:44.120* :  We'll speak to our correspondent from BBC Persian about the mood in Tehran and our reporter
*01:44.120- 01:46.740* :  in Jerusalem about concerns amongst Israelis.
*01:47.620- 01:53.600* :  A derv diplomacy lies ahead with a G7 meeting and a UN Security Council gathering to find
*01:53.600- 01:55.740* :  ways of de-escalating the situation.
*01:58.820- 02:04.900* :  For years, Israel and Iran have been engaged in a shadow war, with Iran using proxy forces
*02:04.900- 02:07.840* :  in Syria and Lebanon to carry out attacks.
*02:08.500- 02:12.960* :  All that changed in the early hours of Sunday morning, as Tehran, for the first time,
*02:12.980- 02:16.580* :  carried out strikes from Iran against Israeli territory.
*02:17.080- 02:19.900* :  This sent wave after wave of drones and missiles.
*02:20.520- 02:23.040* :  Daniel Hagari is the Israeli military spokesperson.
*02:23.520- 02:26.080* :  Meshiran, Patrabe, Mithkafar, Nage, Israel,
*02:26.540- 02:32.440* :  last night Iran started an attack against Israel and launched more than 300 different threats.
*02:33.120- 02:38.220* :  The Iranian threat met the Israeli defence forces, aerial and technological superiority,
*02:39.040- 02:43.260* :  together with a strong fighting coalition that intercepted most of the threats.
*02:44.020- 02:47.960* :  We intercepted 99% of those launched towards Israel's territory.
*02:48.660- 02:51.320* :  This is a very significant strategic achievement.
*02:51.780- 02:56.880* :  Iran said the attack was in retaliation for an air strike two weeks ago on one of its
*02:56.880- 03:01.060* :  consulates in Damascus, widely thought to have been carried out by Israel.
*03:01.380- 03:04.660* :  Our correspondent James Landau sent this report from Jerusalem.
*03:05.100- 03:09.560* :  The first sign an attack was imminent came during the evening when the Israeli Army announced
*03:09.560- 03:13.840* :  its forces were on full alert and dozens of warplanes were in the air.
*03:13.900- 03:18.880* :  The civil authorities said mass gatherings and educational activities were to be restricted
*03:19.660- 03:22.120* :  and then an army spokesman confirmed the rumors.
*03:22.600- 03:26.020* :  Iranian drones had been launched and were bound for Israel.
*03:26.700- 03:29.340* :  People were urged to take shelter if they heard sirens.
*03:30.000- 03:34.680* :  In a television address, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was prepared.
*03:34.700- 03:41.020* :  Our defence systems are deployed, he said.
*03:41.020- 03:44.960* :  We are prepared for any scenario, both in defence and attack.
*03:45.220- 03:50.160* :  The state of Israel is strong, the IDF is strong, the public is strong.
*03:51.360- 03:54.060* :  Countries in the region announced their airspace was closed.
*03:54.600- 03:56.460* :  We got a sense of the scale of the threat.
*03:56.920- 03:59.740* :  About 100 drones were in the air, the army said.
*04:00.400- 04:03.340* :  Iran confirmed the attack but went further.
*04:03.640- 04:07.960* :  They weren't just drones involved, but crews and ballistic missiles too.
*04:08.660- 04:14.580* :  Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Hamine said what he called the malicious Zionist regime
*04:14.580- 04:18.800* :  was being punished for an air strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria.
*04:19.420- 04:22.700* :  Iran said the targets were military, but then came this.
*04:30.680- 04:36.240* :  We heard sirens across the rooftops of Jerusalem, explosions lit up the night as iron dome
*04:36.240- 04:38.660* :  air defence missiles soared into the sky.
*04:39.200- 04:42.140* :  The IDF reported similar alerts across the country.
*04:42.820- 04:48.280* :  Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for Israel's army, was giving almost hourly updates.
*04:48.760- 04:56.580* :  The regime of Iran fired a massive swarm over 200 kilo drones, cruise missiles and ballistic
*04:56.580- 04:58.700* :  missiles towards the state of Israel.
*04:59.680- 05:06.240* :  Together with our allies and partners across the region, we are operating at this very moment
*05:06.320- 05:08.780* :  to defend Israel from Iran's attack.
*05:09.220- 05:13.860* :  It became clear the armed forces of those allies and partners were helping to intercept
*05:13.860- 05:17.260* :  many of the drones and missiles before they reached Israel.
*05:17.680- 05:23.140* :  Inevitably some got through, causing what Daniel Hagari said was minor damage to a military
*05:23.140- 05:23.640* :  base.
*05:24.160- 05:28.160* :  There were few reports of casualties, apart from one girl critically injured.
*05:28.720- 05:34.120* :  The night Israel's war cabinet met, one official said there'd be a significant response.
*05:34.780- 05:41.680* :  James Landau, it's not like this wasn't expected, and Israel was certainly prepared, but
*05:41.680- 05:42.600* :  it's still a shock.
*05:42.880- 05:44.140* :  So, what's the mood in Israel?
*05:44.680- 05:47.660* :  I asked our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bashager in Jerusalem.
*05:48.160- 05:53.140* :  Well, it was a very long night for millions across the country because, you know, air raid
*05:53.140- 05:54.960* :  alerts sounded in the middle of the night.
*05:54.960- 06:02.800* :  There were explosions from objects being intercepted by the air defense systems, but this morning,
*06:02.800- 06:06.060* :  as far as I can tell, it seems that life is back to normal.
*06:06.200- 06:08.680* :  The air space has been reopened.
*06:09.020- 06:12.940* :  This is the first working day of the week, so I'm assuming that lots of people were going
*06:12.940- 06:14.480* :  back to work.
*06:15.080- 06:17.600* :  And I can't see any sign of panic.
*06:17.660- 06:24.160* :  Obviously, there has been a lot of anxiety, a lot of concern, especially before this attack.
*06:24.160- 06:29.800* :  As for days, we've been talking about those warnings that an Iranian attack was imminent,
*06:30.220- 06:36.400* :  but this morning, there aren't any kind of recommendations by the authorities, so it
*06:36.400- 06:38.620* :  does feel like life is going back to normal.
*06:38.920- 06:43.620* :  What you can guarantee, though, is that behind the scenes, there will be frantic political
*06:43.620- 06:46.440* :  activity decide what happens next.
*06:46.920- 06:51.220* :  What indications are you getting if any about where Israel goes now?
*06:51.500- 06:55.980* :  I think the big question this morning is about whether there will be any kind of Israeli
*06:55.980- 06:57.560* :  reaction to all of this.
*06:57.780- 07:04.380* :  This was an unprecedented attack for the first time ever Iran carried out a direct attack
*07:04.900- 07:05.620* :  on Israel.
*07:05.620- 07:11.740* :  So before this attack happened, Israeli authorities had warned Iran that any kind of direct attack
*07:12.160- 07:14.560* :  would lead to an Israeli reaction.
*07:14.660- 07:21.600* :  So this morning, the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant said that the confrontation with
*07:21.600- 07:24.020* :  Iran wasn't yet over.
*07:24.380- 07:29.220* :  There was a meeting of the war cabinet overnight to discuss the situation, but at the same time,
*07:29.260- 07:33.160* :  there was a phone call between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu.
*07:33.500- 07:40.540* :  President Biden again reaffirmed American support for Israel, but very interestingly, according
*07:40.540- 07:46.300* :  to reports, he also told Prime Minister Netanyahu that the U.S. doesn't support the idea of
*07:46.300- 07:47.640* :  any kind of retaliation.
*07:47.640- 07:51.560* :  So I think there's a lot of effort behind the scenes now to de-escalate the situation.
*07:52.060- 07:56.000* :  Where does this situation now leave Mr Netanyahu politically?
*07:56.000- 07:57.540* :  We can do strengthen, do you think?
*07:57.860- 08:02.840* :  I think there will be some pressure, perhaps, from some of his hard-line allies for some
*08:02.840- 08:06.020* :  kind of response, some kind of Israeli reaction.
*08:06.020- 08:12.660* :  He has been under a lot of pressure already from international partners who are very frustrated
*08:12.740- 08:19.540* :  with the way the war in Gaza is going, with a high number of civilian casualties that desperate
*08:19.540- 08:21.480* :  humanitarian situation in Gaza.
*08:22.000- 08:25.900* :  Internally, he's under a lot of pressure from the families of the hostages who want to
*08:25.900- 08:30.240* :  deal with Hamas for the hostages to be freed, but he's also under pressure from some of
*08:30.240- 08:34.220* :  his allies who don't want to see any kind of concession to Hamas.
*08:34.220- 08:40.640* :  So I think this adds an extra layer, perhaps, of difficulties for the Prime Ministers.
*08:40.640- 08:42.900* :  He considers his options.
*08:43.660- 08:49.180* :  As Hugo was saying, the U.S. President Joe Biden has spoken to Benjamin Netanyahu.
*08:49.180- 08:52.720* :  He said that U.S. support for Israel is ironclad.
*08:53.140- 08:58.080* :  Mr Biden will convene a meeting with G7 leaders later today to agree a united response.
*08:58.720- 09:01.820* :  So what kind of support can we expect the U.S. to offer?
*09:02.240- 09:04.480* :  The correspondent Will Vernon is in Washington.
*09:04.820- 09:12.000* :  This was an unprecedented, large-scale attack on America's most important ally in the Middle
*09:12.000- 09:15.040* :  East directly onto its territory by Iran.
*09:15.040- 09:20.620* :  So the Israelis will almost certainly be looking to retaliate, and I think pressure will now
*09:20.620- 09:26.280* :  grow on the Biden administration over what exactly to do about that, whether the Israelis
*09:26.280- 09:32.300* :  should be reined in somehow the level of support that the U.S. should offer the Israelis.
*09:32.700- 09:37.980* :  Whatever the conclusion is, they will be urged to proceed with caution to ensure they don't
*09:37.980- 09:46.540* :  get somehow dragged into an escalatory tit-for-tat conflict with Iran that could trigger a wider
*09:46.940- 09:47.440* :  regional war.
*09:47.840- 09:52.540* :  But as I say, President Biden in his statement so far is just talking about a diplomatic
*09:52.540- 09:53.540* :  response, isn't he?
*09:53.540- 09:59.360* :  There's no indication there of the extent of support the U.S. might offer.
*09:59.760- 10:03.980* :  It's actually been not a bad result, actually, for Mr. Biden.
*10:03.980- 10:09.760* :  He said in that statement that no U.S. forces or facilities were hit in the Iranian assault
*10:09.760- 10:10.220* :  today.
*10:10.640- 10:16.540* :  And that is a good thing because it means that America is less likely to be somehow forced
*10:16.580- 10:20.220* :  into any sort of direct military confrontation with Iran.
*10:20.720- 10:25.880* :  And this is one of the reasons why there were repeated warnings from the White House,
*10:26.200- 10:28.580* :  from other U.S. officials in the last few days.
*10:28.580- 10:34.180* :  They wanted to de-escalate their tensions and ensure that this didn't somehow snowball
*10:34.180- 10:36.540* :  into something that was then out of their control.
*10:37.060- 10:37.420* :  Wilbur.
*10:38.940- 10:43.960* :  Still to calm in this podcast, our international editor, Jeremy Bowen, gives us his view
*10:44.160- 10:45.620* :  on what might happen next.
*10:45.620- 10:51.440* :  A red line has been crossed for the first time since the Islamic Republic started back
*10:51.440- 10:53.820* :  in 1979 after the revolution.
*10:54.580- 10:58.740* :  The Iranians have directly hit Israeli soil.
*10:59.280- 11:04.460* :  It's by no means certain that this is the end of it, that the line is going to be drawn
*11:04.460- 11:04.980* :  under it.
*11:05.080- 11:09.100* :  But I think that if the line is not drawn under it, then it really is a very dangerous
*11:09.100- 11:09.360* :  moment.
*11:11.860- 11:15.940* :  The Global Jigsaw is the podcast looking at the world through the lens of its media.
*11:16.240- 11:18.900* :  Stay medium now, which topics they can and can't discuss.
*11:19.280- 11:23.580* :  We fill gaps and connect dots to better understand what's happening in the world.
*11:23.820- 11:25.540* :  It's important to remember the context.
*11:25.900- 11:29.200* :  An untangled and narratives aimed at influencing your views.
*11:29.640- 11:30.640* :  Titely controlled.
*11:30.640- 11:33.280* :  It's not so healthy to be a journalist there.
*11:33.840- 11:36.200* :  The Global Jigsaw from the BBC World Service.
*11:36.760- 11:41.220* :  Listen now by searching for the explanation, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*11:45.520- 11:49.900* :  As we heard earlier, Israel says there was little damage done by the attacks overall.
*11:50.460- 11:56.500* :  The IDF says 99 percent of the more than 300 cruise missiles and drones were shot down.
*11:56.500- 12:02.280* :  But the chief of Iran's army, General Muhammad Hossein Baghari, has warned that if Israel
*12:02.280- 12:05.380* :  chooses to retaliate, more attacks will follow.
*12:07.400- 12:12.220* :  From our point of view, this operation is over, and there is no intention to continue
*12:12.220- 12:12.900* :  the operation.
*12:13.460- 12:18.380* :  But if the Zionist regime takes any action against the Islamic Republic, whether on our
*12:18.380- 12:23.780* :  soil or in places belonging to us in Syria or elsewhere, our next operation will be much
*12:24.100- 12:24.480* :  larger.
*12:24.880- 12:29.700* :  Baron Abassi from BBC Persian told me how the attacks were being viewed in Iran.
*12:30.100- 12:33.260* :  The Iranian government has hailed this operation as a success.
*12:33.300- 12:38.980* :  The chief of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps has said that it did better than expected.
*12:38.980- 12:46.600* :  It was limited and those Israeli assets that were involved in the attack two weeks ago
*12:46.600- 12:49.700* :  on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.
*12:49.940- 12:54.280* :  They viewed this operation as over and they have no intention of carrying on.
*12:54.300- 12:59.660* :  But they have warned Israel not to retaliate and they've also warned the United States that
*12:59.660- 13:07.240* :  if it supports Israel in any kind of retaliatory operation, they will attack US bases in the
*13:07.240- 13:07.640* :  region.
*13:07.960- 13:13.620* :  And with regards to social media and people in general across Iran, what kind of reaction
*13:14.140- 13:15.020* :  has there been to this?
*13:15.020- 13:16.480* :  Is it generally supported?
*13:16.900- 13:19.960* :  The Iranian regime is very unpopular among ordinary people.
*13:20.440- 13:24.760* :  We have seen different rounds of protests in Iran, deadly protests that have resulted
*13:25.360- 13:29.120* :  in hundreds of people dead and thousands of people imprisoned.
*13:29.120- 13:35.020* :  So the Iranians have, time and again, expressed their support for peace and have said that
*13:35.280- 13:40.460* :  they do not want the Iranian regime to get involved in any kind of war in the region,
*13:40.460- 13:43.120* :  even through its proxies or direct attacks.
*13:43.120- 13:46.960* :  So they have taken into the social media and have said that this is a war between the
*13:46.960- 13:49.120* :  two regimes and the Iranian's one peace.
*13:49.120- 13:53.900* :  But they have been a handful of supporters of the regime who took to the streets last night
*13:53.900- 13:57.960* :  after the operation was launched and they were celebrating on the streets.
*13:58.340- 14:02.860* :  So the Iranian regime doesn't necessarily gain credibility by doing this.
*14:02.860- 14:04.980* :  So what is the overall purpose of it?
*14:05.280- 14:11.260* :  The Iranian regime seems to have been seeking to retain its credibility among its own supporters
*14:11.260- 14:15.840* :  and also their proxies, its proxy forces in the region.
*14:15.940- 14:21.980* :  It has so far been reluctant to get involved directly with Israel.
*14:21.980- 14:26.360* :  Two regimes have been involved in kind of a proxy war over the years.
*14:26.360- 14:33.100* :  But Iran had not responded to any kind of attack that Israel did against its assets in the
*14:33.100- 14:33.420* :  region.
*14:33.660- 14:38.800* :  But this seems that Iran seemed this was a red line that had been crossed and it was
*14:38.800- 14:40.600* :  under pressure to respond.
*14:41.060- 14:41.860* :  Baranabasi.
*14:42.520- 14:46.240* :  There's been widespread international concern over the Iranian attack.
*14:46.260- 14:52.100* :  The United Nations, Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed deep alarm at what he
*14:52.100- 14:55.740* :  said was a very real danger of a devastating escalation.
*14:56.240- 15:01.380* :  Britain said the attack was reckless and showed that Iran was intent on sowing chaos in
*15:01.380- 15:02.200* :  its own backyard.
*15:02.860- 15:08.020* :  Saudi Arabia has called on all parties to spare the region from the dangers of war.
*15:08.660- 15:11.520* :  Egypt and Qatar urged maximum restraint.
*15:12.200- 15:16.940* :  China, meanwhile, said the escalation was the latest spillover from the conflict in Gaza
*15:17.200- 15:18.200* :  and called for calm.
*15:19.020- 15:22.500* :  So how are Israelis reacting to the Iranian drone attacks?
*15:23.240- 15:26.260* :  I spoke to our correspondent Joel Greenberg in Jerusalem.
*15:26.680- 15:31.080* :  Israeli politicians feel they've succeeded in what they could say is they've thwarted
*15:31.080- 15:32.000* :  the Iranian attack.
*15:32.660- 15:38.260* :  And seeing this also in a way as a diplomatic advantage for Israel, which has really taken
*15:38.260- 15:43.480* :  a beating during the Gaza war because of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the high
*15:43.480- 15:48.520* :  loss of civilian lives there, a feeling that now the world is kind of looking at things
*15:48.520- 15:52.560* :  a little differently and seeing the Iranian threat and what Israel is facing.
*15:53.320- 15:57.740* :  And Israel's success in repelling this threat, the feeling is, and a lot of the analysis
*15:57.740- 16:01.220* :  today should work to Israel's advantage internationally.
*16:02.020- 16:06.620* :  Joel, what's just one question about the media reaction to what happened overnight?
*16:07.640- 16:12.940* :  Well, one of the commentators who's very prominent in one of the biggest websites here was
*16:12.940- 16:18.320* :  saying he described it as a defeat for Iran and a real chance for Israel to rehabilitate
*16:18.320- 16:23.060* :  its international image, which again, as we said earlier, has taken a real beating during
*16:23.060- 16:28.020* :  the Gaza war and that this is an opportunity for the West to see things for what they are.
*16:28.220- 16:29.480* :  Iran is the main threat.
*16:29.480- 16:32.580* :  Hamas in Gaza is a proxy of Iran.
*16:32.580- 16:34.000* :  This is the way he described it.
*16:34.520- 16:38.660* :  And that this was an opportunity for Israel to get out of its international isolation and
*16:38.660- 16:39.160* :  the corner.
*16:39.220- 16:44.760* :  It's been in diplomatically because of the civilian losses and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
*16:45.260- 16:47.400* :  So that's one take on it.
*16:47.800- 16:53.300* :  Another again is advice by some of these commentators for the government to consider very carefully
*16:53.300- 16:58.740* :  whether it should respond in any big way because again, the tremendous risk of regional
*16:58.740- 17:02.520* :  war and especially attacks from Lebanon by his Bala.
*17:03.060- 17:05.300* :  And of course, again, perhaps from Iran.
*17:05.300- 17:10.320* :  So that's definitely a word of caution there for the government to think very carefully
*17:10.320- 17:13.560* :  before it decides on any kind of response to what happened overnight.
*17:13.920- 17:17.580* :  Secondly, there will be pressure on the Prime Minister to retaliate.
*17:17.580- 17:22.740* :  There have been ideas put forward that Israel would look weak if it did not respond to the
*17:22.740- 17:24.840* :  Sun Press and at the direct attack from Iran.
*17:25.500- 17:29.580* :  On the other hand, the Prime Minister is under very heavy pressure from the United States,
*17:29.580- 17:31.460* :  the UK, other European countries.
*17:32.160- 17:36.460* :  Not to do anything that would ignite a regional conflict, a general regional conflict.
*17:36.680- 17:38.540* :  Now, these drone and missile strikes were Iran.
*17:38.540- 17:39.540* :  They were unprecedented.
*17:39.580- 17:45.080* :  The first time that Iran had sent missiles from Iran into Israel.
*17:45.780- 17:52.700* :  Do you think people in Israel, ordinary people, see that unprecedented nature for what it
*17:52.700- 17:56.680* :  is or are they not necessarily overly concerned by this escalation?
*17:56.860- 18:02.360* :  The immediate threat actually is from Lebanon where Hezbollah, the Iranian back group, has
*18:02.360- 18:06.640* :  quite an arsenal of missiles that it could fire at Israeli population centers.
*18:07.260- 18:12.980* :  I think there is worry that if there is a substantial Israeli response, what the implications
*18:12.980- 18:17.800* :  would be for ordinary Israelis if this would ignite a conflict, for example, across the
*18:17.820- 18:18.700* :  Lebanese frontier.
*18:19.920- 18:24.940* :  On the one hand, yes, I think a lot of satisfaction and relief that the air defense systems worked
*18:24.940- 18:32.160* :  and managed to intercept a large number, maybe most of the incoming missiles and drones.
*18:32.180- 18:38.660* :  On the other hand, I think there is some apprehension about whether an Israeli large-scale response
*18:38.660- 18:43.060* :  any Iran could bring population centers under attack here.
*18:43.060- 18:45.920* :  So I don't think there is any enthusiasm about that right now.
*18:46.220- 18:51.600* :  Joe Greenberg, let's get some more analysis now from our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
*18:52.240- 18:56.960* :  Mary Mosheri asked him his views about whether the situation will escalate.
*18:57.140- 18:59.520* :  I think a lot of it depends on what Israel does itself.
*18:59.780- 19:03.160* :  And they are getting a lot of signals from their allies who help them out enormously,
*19:03.280- 19:04.720* :  of course, in the course of the night.
*19:05.460- 19:11.320* :  The Americans giving this very strong signal, iron-clad security, essentially saying,
*19:11.320- 19:12.180* :  we've got your back.
*19:12.180- 19:14.720* :  The British were involved, the Jordanians were involved.
*19:15.420- 19:19.700* :  And the Israelis themselves, of course, have got extremely formidable air defense capabilities.
*19:19.740- 19:28.280* :  And so it for Iran, I think it will be a bit crushing to see that they got almost nothing
*19:28.280- 19:29.500* :  through that net.
*19:30.160- 19:37.000* :  So the question now is, will Israel decide to hit back perhaps on Iranian soil?
*19:37.500- 19:39.900* :  And that would be a further escalation.
*19:39.900- 19:43.880* :  The message is that I've been getting, I was speaking to senior Western diplomat who
*19:43.880- 19:48.380* :  said to me, he said, look, it's been a long night, our job now is to draw a line under
*19:48.400- 19:48.580* :  this.
*19:49.220- 19:56.200* :  In other words, started on April 1st, this particular episode with the Israelis, I mean they haven't
*19:56.200- 19:58.800* :  said that they've done it, but they've made it clear that they've done it.
*19:59.220- 20:03.760* :  They attacked the diplomatic compound that Iran has in Damascus.
*20:04.200- 20:08.800* :  They killed a senior general, another senior general and a number of others in doing that.
*20:09.400- 20:14.700* :  And I think that the Iranians interpreted that as an attack on their own soil, which they
*20:14.700- 20:15.460* :  had to answer.
*20:16.000- 20:20.280* :  They telegraphed quite clearly that they were going to do something.
*20:21.220- 20:23.820* :  So Israel was ready.
*20:24.380- 20:27.020* :  They mobilized reserves in their ed defense units.
*20:27.020- 20:29.500* :  The Americans were ready, the Brits, the others.
*20:30.440- 20:36.220* :  So that's the Western side, Israel's allies, and I'm hoping that that's the end of this
*20:36.280- 20:38.260* :  particular episode, but that's not so.
*20:38.640- 20:42.520* :  You said it would be crushing for the Iranians that what's happened hasn't had more of an
*20:42.520- 20:47.280* :  impact, but Sam is saying that that may be what they actually wanted, a calibrated response
*20:47.280- 20:50.820* :  that was calibrated to not really do damage, but to send a message.
*20:51.080- 20:51.240* :  Yeah.
*20:51.620- 20:56.460* :  And for Iran, it's very important to try and restore a sense of deterrence.
*20:56.800- 21:02.840* :  That's what their network of allies, his below others, the hoofies, that's what all
*21:02.840- 21:03.460* :  that's about.
*21:05.040- 21:11.500* :  And clearly the fact that the Israelis were able to hit a very senior officer and destroy
*21:11.500- 21:17.180* :  a building in the diplomatic compound and think that they could get away with it effectively
*21:17.180- 21:19.680* :  is something that shows their deterrence was not strong.
*21:20.120- 21:22.000* :  So they're trying to restore that.
*21:22.800- 21:28.340* :  Tell me a little bit more now about the US-Israel dynamic because you mentioned there what the
*21:28.340- 21:32.200* :  US is saying publicly, but there's always a difference isn't it between public and private.
*21:32.760- 21:35.640* :  Do you think there's more pressure privately and that's going to be key?
*21:35.900- 21:43.620* :  Well, I usually very reliable and well informed Israeli journalists tweeted that Biden has
*21:43.620- 21:49.640* :  effectively said to Netanyahu, you've got a victory here, you look stronger, take this,
*21:50.040- 21:52.060* :  bank it, that's it.
*21:52.980- 21:58.780* :  And noting his response when Biden and his statement, he was taught, he said, we'll convene the G748
*21:58.780- 22:01.000* :  diplomatic response to this.
*22:01.560- 22:04.580* :  Not we will get our allies together to see what else we can do to Iran.
*22:05.460- 22:11.580* :  So I think that what has not changed is that the Americans do not want an escalation
*22:11.860- 22:12.760* :  in the Middle East.
*22:13.160- 22:20.360* :  They don't want Israel hitting mainland Iran or even necessarily upping what they're
*22:20.800- 22:26.860* :  doing to Iran's most powerful ally, which is his brother in Lebanon, but you know, a red
*22:26.880- 22:28.120* :  line has been crossed.
*22:28.660- 22:34.940* :  For the first time since the Islamic Republic started back in 79, after the revolution,
*22:36.200- 22:40.340* :  the Iranians have directly hit Israeli soil.
*22:41.160- 22:47.120* :  So I've seen two noises coming from Israeli right wingers saying, we can't let this stand.
*22:47.220- 22:48.020* :  We have to respond.
*22:48.020- 22:49.160* :  This is a tough neighborhood.
*22:49.580- 22:50.500* :  We can't show weakness.
*22:51.820- 22:58.400* :  So it's by no means certain that this is the end of it, that the line is going to be
*22:58.400- 22:59.140* :  drawn under it.
*22:59.260- 23:03.660* :  But I think that if the line is not drawn under it, then it really is a very dangerous moment.
*23:03.900- 23:06.380* :  How long before we find out where that line is going to be drawn?
*23:06.600- 23:12.840* :  That's a question that we can only speculate about, whether it would be immediate or whether
*23:12.840- 23:15.360* :  they might wait or maybe they wouldn't do it at all.
*23:15.920- 23:20.700* :  I think there's an enormous amount of diplomatic activity going along now to try and stop
*23:20.700- 23:21.600* :  that happening.
*23:22.040- 23:25.620* :  And in the meantime, what's happening in Gaza has now become a secondary consideration,
*23:25.620- 23:26.120* :  hasn't it?
*23:26.860- 23:30.580* :  Well, this in a sense has changed the subject, and this is quite good as well for Israel.
*23:30.580- 23:37.780* :  It's another reason for Netanyahu to feel much happier this morning because there was
*23:37.960- 23:42.560* :  been a great deal of tension between the Americans and the Israelis about the way that the
*23:42.560- 23:47.540* :  Israelis have conducted the war in Gaza, the famine that their Siege has created, the
*23:47.540- 23:49.260* :  numbers of civilians who they've killed.
*23:49.820- 23:54.260* :  And now, what they're talking about, a lion's unity, America's got you back.
*23:54.920- 24:00.100* :  So that's the kind of vibe that the Israelis and Netanyahu would far rather hear.
*24:00.340- 24:01.100* :  Jeremy Boat.
