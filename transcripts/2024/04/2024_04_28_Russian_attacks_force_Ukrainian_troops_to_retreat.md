*01:13.240- 01:17.580* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Monday the 29th of April, these are our
*01:17.580- 01:18.460* :  main stories.
*01:19.080- 01:24.600* :  Russia pounds Ukrainian forces which have fallen back to new positions as Kiev waits for
*01:24.600- 01:27.200* :  arms from the U.S. and other Western allies.
*01:27.860- 01:32.800* :  Cracks in the Israeli government as divisions over a deal for a ceasefire and hostage-releasing
*01:32.800- 01:34.360* :  Gaza are laid bare.
*01:34.600- 01:40.000* :  Hardliners want to attack the remaining Hamas battalions in Ratham and there is an increasing
*01:40.000- 01:44.540* :  voice in Israel who think the Israeli government should prioritize getting hostages released
*01:44.540- 01:45.740* :  through some sort of deal.
*01:46.640- 01:49.780* :  Unbearable heat in Gulf's Southeast Asia again.
*01:50.240- 01:54.720* :  People are really going to have to adapt scientists say to this new normal because of climate
*01:54.720- 01:58.300* :  change, wearing looser clothing, adjusting their work in school days.
*02:01.320- 02:06.640* :  Also in this podcast, the winner of this year's top prize for Arab literature is announced
*02:06.640- 02:12.900* :  and the former wife of Canada's Prime Minister Sophie Gregor Trudeau on her life and survival.
*02:12.980- 02:18.900* :  We should maybe embrace the difficult times with more certainty knowing that we have the
*02:18.900- 02:22.640* :  resilience as human beings to walk through it and that if we have each other's minds and
*02:22.640- 02:26.300* :  backs and hearts, we will be able to not only adapt but thrive.
*02:31.380- 02:32.580* :  We start in Ukraine.
*02:40.320- 02:45.760* :  Despite the sound of explosions around a village in the eastern Donbass region, despite all
*02:45.760- 02:51.140* :  the promises of money and support, the outlook for Ukrainian forces at the front, at present,
*02:51.140- 02:53.720* :  is bleak, especially in Donbass.
*02:54.320- 02:59.880* :  That's according to Ukraine's commander-in-chief General Alexander Sysky, and even if temporary,
*02:59.880- 03:05.180* :  he says the pressure is fierce and Ukrainian forces have had to withdraw from several positions.
*03:05.940- 03:10.980* :  Our correspondent in Ukraine, James Water, has told me more about what is happening on the ground.
*03:11.400- 03:18.520* :  We've just travelled from the Donetsk region where we saw new trenches being dug 30 kilometres
*03:18.760- 03:20.000* :  from the front lines.
*03:20.100- 03:25.600* :  Now, Alexander Sysky, he's talking about the entire front line where he describes multiple
*03:25.600- 03:30.140* :  advances and he says it's at its worst in the eastern Donetsk region around the town
*03:30.140- 03:34.200* :  of Prakrosk, which has become a military hub really in this invasion.
*03:34.380- 03:38.620* :  He says his troops have had to pull out of defensive lines which were established earlier
*03:38.620- 03:43.140* :  this year when they lost a town called Avdivka, but it doesn't stop there.
*03:43.160- 03:48.540* :  He talks about Russia using its air superiority in the northeast around Kupyansk, this town
*03:48.540- 03:51.560* :  where the front line is starting to encroach.
*03:52.020- 03:57.060* :  President Sysky points out that Russia has dropped more than 9,000 aerial bombs he claims
*03:57.060- 04:02.440* :  from fighter jets, which are becoming increasingly unchallenged, so this really is a bleak assessment.
*04:02.580- 04:08.700* :  Despite this eagerly anticipated multi-billion-dollar military aid package from the US, it's clear
*04:08.700- 04:13.480* :  that significant Russian gains may well come before any kind of Ukrainian benefit.
*04:13.880- 04:18.800* :  So what is Ukraine trying to do now, is it just trying to literally hold the line?
*04:19.140- 04:22.180* :  That's being openly admitted and they are digging in.
*04:22.760- 04:26.880* :  You know, I've been close to front lines in 2022 when Ukraine is liberating and you
*04:26.880- 04:31.820* :  have this kind of wind in sales atmosphere, where there was a direction of traveling
*04:31.820- 04:36.160* :  Ukraine's favor, but when it goes the other way, you see exhausted troops in the street.
*04:36.780- 04:40.160* :  We were with an artillery team and they're still rationing ammunition.
*04:40.780- 04:46.720* :  Russia has almost unlimited shells it seems in how it's able to keep up its artillery
*04:47.220- 04:47.240* :  strikes.
*04:47.380- 04:49.920* :  So when you have that kind of muscle, it's very difficult.
*04:49.980- 04:53.480* :  It certainly looks like in the case of the Eastern, the Hansk region, Russia is trying
*04:53.480- 04:58.920* :  to take all of it up to its borders in the near term, so it's a concerning time certainly
*04:58.920- 05:00.900* :  for Ukrainian forces and their commanders.
*05:01.560- 05:07.200* :  So does everything really depend on the next few weeks before this new military hardware
*05:07.200- 05:07.820* :  arrives?
*05:08.340- 05:11.880* :  I mean, could Russia really make significant advances in this time?
*05:12.040- 05:17.160* :  I think over the past six months, Ukraine has lost around 600 square kilometers of territory,
*05:17.220- 05:20.580* :  which might not sound much in the country the size of Ukraine, but it's that direction
*05:20.580- 05:21.780* :  of travel I talk about.
*05:21.980- 05:27.580* :  And so if you see entire regions like the Hansk fall, then you have big cities like
*05:27.580- 05:33.240* :  Nipro and Harakiv, if they look like they could fall, which is feared, then this war has
*05:33.240- 05:39.260* :  a very different feel quickly for Ukraine and the dynamics of the country start to drastically
*05:39.260- 05:42.440* :  change on top of the fifth of territories thus so far.
*05:43.140- 05:45.060* :  James Waterhouse in Ukraine.
*05:46.020- 05:50.660* :  Divisions in the Israeli government are becoming more apparent ahead of ceasefire talks on
*05:50.660- 05:51.180* :  Monday.
*05:51.180- 05:56.720* :  Mediators have stepped up efforts to reach a deal ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
*05:56.720- 06:00.400* :  planned military assault on the southern city of Rafa in Gaza.
*06:01.040- 06:05.020* :  The Israeli war cabinet Minister Benny Gantz says the government would have no right to
*06:05.020- 06:10.940* :  exist if it prevented a hostage deal, while the far-right Finance Minister Bezelel Smotrich
*06:10.940- 06:15.840* :  insists credibility would be lost if the Rafa operation is called off.
*06:16.340- 06:19.080* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem where it gave us told us more.
*06:19.500- 06:24.700* :  The hard line is probably including Mr Netanyahu himself, want to attack the remaining Hamas
*06:24.700- 06:27.600* :  battalions in Rafa, which is a town in southern Gaza.
*06:28.160- 06:32.440* :  There are international concerns that that would lead to a humanitarian crisis because
*06:32.440- 06:35.740* :  of more than a million and a half people currently sheltering in Rafa.
*06:36.220- 06:41.940* :  But there are also concerns within Israel itself about the fate of the 130 so hostages
*06:42.280- 06:46.320* :  who are still held by Hamas, perhaps as many as a hundred of them still alive.
*06:46.780- 06:51.320* :  And there is an increasing voice in Israel who think the Israeli government should prioritize
*06:51.320- 06:56.840* :  getting hostages released through some sort of deal, rather than prioritising the military
*06:57.480- 06:57.500* :  objective.
*06:57.500- 07:01.020* :  And that is causing increasing headaches, I think, for Mr Netanyahu.
*07:01.240- 07:08.260* :  What is your sense of the general Israeli view of the government there and indeed of Benjamin
*07:08.260- 07:09.040* :  Netanyahu?
*07:09.640- 07:10.880* :  He is deeply unpopular.
*07:10.880- 07:15.280* :  I think there would be serious attempts to try and get Mr Netanyahu out of office,
*07:15.280- 07:17.960* :  throw it up for the fact that there is a war going on at the minute.
*07:18.540- 07:22.120* :  I think Mr Netanyahu is blamed in what happened in early October.
*07:22.120- 07:27.200* :  But also the fate of the hostages is the overwhelming priority for all Israelis.
*07:27.220- 07:33.480* :  The release of a couple of videos featuring three male hostages in recent days has re-energised
*07:33.840- 07:38.000* :  the movement who really, really want Mr Netanyahu to put his military aspirations on
*07:38.000- 07:41.720* :  the back burner and do his level up most to release the hostages.
*07:41.980- 07:47.520* :  Now Mr Netanyahu says the hostages are his priority, but many people think it comes
*07:47.520- 07:49.220* :  second to the military objectives.
*07:49.580- 07:54.020* :  Most Israelis that we see this in regular daily protests, they really want the hostages
*07:54.420- 07:55.340* :  to be prioritised.
*07:55.680- 08:01.560* :  And what's the importance of the United States do you think in the Israeli decision to possibly
*08:01.560- 08:02.300* :  enter Raffa?
*08:02.400- 08:08.000* :  Well, the Americans have already urged the Israelis not to have this full-scale operation
*08:08.480- 08:10.940* :  in Raffa because of the humanitarian consequences.
*08:11.660- 08:15.600* :  But now I think the most important thing to be peace talks, which have been moderated
*08:15.600- 08:19.300* :  by the Qataris and the Egyptians and the Americans, and have been more abundant really
*08:19.300- 08:23.540* :  for a few weeks, there's some sort of emphasis and impetus now behind those again.
*08:23.880- 08:26.420* :  There's a Hamas delegation going to go to Cairo.
*08:26.900- 08:32.060* :  We learn that perhaps the Israelis and Hamas are prepared to make minor concessions.
*08:32.420- 08:36.840* :  And there's a big effort now to try and get peace talks back and the way, which may lead
*08:36.840- 08:41.420* :  to some sort of temporary ceasefire, which would include the release of some of the
*08:41.420- 08:45.100* :  hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
*08:45.400- 08:49.900* :  I think it's still a very long shot because there's a big gulf between the Israeli position
*08:49.900- 08:51.060* :  and the Hamas position.
*08:51.520- 08:56.220* :  But Anthony Blinken, the American Secretary of State, is in the region and he will be really
*08:56.220- 09:01.600* :  pushing both sides to make most of these talks in Cairo and try to come to some sort
*09:01.600- 09:01.980* :  of deal.
*09:02.540- 09:03.960* :  We're a Davis in Jerusalem.
*09:04.900- 09:10.300* :  Millions of people across South and Southeast Asia are facing sweltering temperatures, prompting
*09:10.300- 09:13.560* :  schools to close and triggering public health warnings.
*09:14.120- 09:18.660* :  The capital of the Philippines, Manila, has seen temperatures reach almost 40 degrees
*09:18.660- 09:23.160* :  Celsius and it could climb to 46 degrees by Monday.
*09:23.700- 09:26.460* :  Our Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Hatton, give us more details.
*09:27.100- 09:33.620* :  Schools have basically reverted back to COVID era measures, so keeping children at homes
*09:33.620- 09:38.920* :  so they can learn from a distance, but there are real worries that children could overheat
*09:39.000- 09:39.520* :  in their homes.
*09:39.520- 09:43.680* :  And many poor families don't have air conditioning, so it's not as if their homes are going to
*09:43.680- 09:45.180* :  be any cooler than the schools.
*09:45.180- 09:49.940* :  And so we're seeing in places like Manila, portable pools being set up.
*09:49.940- 09:54.380* :  So children can take a dick, cool off a little bit and continue with their schooling.
*09:54.420- 09:56.540* :  Workers are also being advised to stay home.
*09:56.920- 10:00.320* :  Now, this heat wave is really scorching Southeast Asia.
*10:00.320- 10:03.700* :  So in Thailand, we're seeing coral and fish dying.
*10:03.700- 10:08.680* :  Those beautiful, verdant, lush green rice patties are drying up in southern Vietnam.
*10:09.240- 10:14.660* :  There's a real warning that crowded rush hour transportation in Malaysia could lead to
*10:15.080- 10:15.720* :  hospitalization.
*10:16.020- 10:20.560* :  Now, scientists have been very, very clear that this heat is due to climate change.
*10:20.560- 10:25.040* :  In fact, they're saying that the records that were broken last year, and again, this
*10:25.040- 10:29.220* :  year, a heat wave in this region, is really due to climate change.
*10:29.220- 10:33.440* :  You know, countries like the Philippines are especially vulnerable to climate change.
*10:33.440- 10:34.520* :  They're low-lying.
*10:34.520- 10:37.260* :  They have many islands, so a lot of coastline.
*10:37.620- 10:39.620* :  People are grouped around the coastlines.
*10:39.660- 10:42.400* :  And so climate change is a real concern.
*10:42.420- 10:47.240* :  People are really going to have to adapt scientists, say, to adjust to this new normal because
*10:47.240- 10:51.560* :  of climate change, wearing looser clothing, adjusting their work in school days.
*10:51.560- 10:57.000* :  You know, this really is almost a permanent feature of life now in Southeast Asia.
*10:57.480- 10:58.260* :  Celia Hatton.
*10:58.880- 11:02.760* :  Police in Sweden have received hundreds of reports from people who've been swindled
*11:02.760- 11:04.160* :  out of their gold belongings.
*11:04.380- 11:10.120* :  In multiple cities in the south of the country, fraudsters posed as a company offering to buy
*11:10.120- 11:13.860* :  jewelry and watches for a good price, but never paid their victims.
*11:14.520- 11:16.440* :  Stephanie Zacherson has this report.
*11:17.000- 11:22.720* :  One day, a flyer from a company buying and valuing gold arrived in 77-year-old Tornelin
*11:22.720- 11:23.620* :  Blotz mailbox.
*11:24.360- 11:28.500* :  She had been thinking about getting rid of some jewelry that was just collecting dust
*11:29.120- 11:30.660* :  to top up her pension payments.
*11:31.000- 11:32.900* :  Tours taking gulg-lokki.
*11:33.780- 11:38.560* :  The company seemed legitimate, and it was hosting a meeting with potential customers
*11:38.560- 11:45.120* :  at a well-known hotel in town, so Toursnets sold them two gold watches, one of which had
*11:45.120- 11:48.900* :  been a gift in her teens, for the equivalent of $1,100.
*11:49.680- 11:54.580* :  But she told Swedish Radio that the money never arrived in her bank account.
*11:54.900- 11:56.720* :  Omaville Tronkel, don't fall.
*11:56.720- 12:01.520* :  She do want to have faith in people, but by the following week, I still hadn't received
*12:01.520- 12:05.640* :  my payment, and then I thought, oh no, I think I've been scammed.
*12:06.040- 12:10.200* :  Toursnets decided to report the fraud, and she is not the only one.
*12:10.560- 12:15.720* :  Swedish police have been contacted by more than 200 people, giving similar descriptions
*12:15.720- 12:17.680* :  of how they've been duped.
*12:18.260- 12:23.160* :  So far, the gang behind the scam has travelled several counties and cities in the south
*12:23.240- 12:23.780* :  of Sweden.
*12:24.300- 12:27.060* :  Local media is filled with different stories.
*12:27.100- 12:33.720* :  Of Ingvor, who sold his beloved coin collection, Rebecca, who sold her mum set of silver spoons,
*12:34.440- 12:39.380* :  and the hotel managers, who were never paid for the conference rooms the fraudsters used
*12:39.380- 12:40.960* :  to conduct their scam.
*12:41.880- 12:47.020* :  Pornshop owner Hans Hanson wasn't surprised that so many seemed to have been tricked.
*12:47.700- 12:52.660* :  With gold prices having surged in the last year, combined with high living costs, many
*12:52.660- 12:56.780* :  of his customers are trying to find new ways to make ends meet.
*12:57.120- 12:59.020* :  There's more to monger.
*12:59.700- 13:05.700* :  Many are struggling with dental costs, food, electricity bills, basically everything.
*13:06.320- 13:09.180* :  It's been a very hard time for a lot of people.
*13:09.920- 13:13.140* :  So far, one man has been arrested in connection with the scam.
*13:13.620- 13:19.100* :  Police are now trawling through hours of CCTV footage from the hotels, collecting evidence
*13:19.100- 13:22.660* :  that they hope will lead them to the rest of the perpetrators.
*13:23.300- 13:24.240* :  Stephanie Zacherson.
*13:25.120- 13:29.940* :  In Justin Trudeau, the man who went on to become Canada's Prime Minister, married Sophie
*13:29.940- 13:36.580* :  Gregois in Montreal in 2005, they immediately became what people called a celebrity glamour
*13:36.580- 13:36.920* :  couple.
*13:37.380- 13:42.320* :  Mr Trudeau is reported to have said at the end of their first date, I'm 31 years old,
*13:42.660- 13:45.460* :  and I've been waiting for you for 31 years.
*13:46.260- 13:51.660* :  Well, the separation last year after 18 years of marriage attracted headlines, and now Sophie
*13:51.660- 13:57.320* :  Gregois Trudeau has published a book, part memoir, and part self-help manual.
*13:57.780- 14:01.880* :  It's called Closer Together, knowing ourselves, loving each other.
*14:02.320- 14:06.020* :  Paul Henley's book to her about why she felt motivated to write it.
*14:06.500- 14:11.340* :  After 20 years of being on the mental health advocacy path, I wanted to bring together my
*14:11.340- 14:14.780* :  own life experience, which is why I share at the beginning of every chapter, you know,
*14:15.060- 14:19.480* :  my own vulnerability, what I went through on my own mental health path, because I believe
*14:19.480- 14:24.960* :  that we can only teach and inspire by experience, and by just being authentic and opened.
*14:25.220- 14:29.580* :  And I'm guessing that especially in your high profile years, you had to put up with quite
*14:29.580- 14:31.600* :  a lot that tested your mental health.
*14:31.820- 14:35.700* :  I know that part of my life is a high profile or however you want to call it.
*14:35.740- 14:37.140* :  I don't believe in it for a second.
*14:37.140- 14:41.920* :  I live my life, grounded at home, in connection with my family, my friends, people everywhere.
*14:41.920- 14:43.320* :  I'm an only child for me.
*14:43.460- 14:48.160* :  Neurishment is from relationships with humans, and I'm curious and I'm an eternal student
*14:48.160- 14:48.620* :  of life.
*14:48.820- 14:49.960* :  I'm a person who can't handle it in the book.
*14:49.960- 14:54.980* :  You talk about very personal things, including struggling with an eating disorder when you
*14:54.980- 14:59.520* :  were much younger, but you will be aware that many people will want to pick the book over
*14:59.520- 15:05.140* :  for gossip, frankly, for nuggets about your relationship with your husband, especially
*15:05.140- 15:06.300* :  now that you're separated.
*15:06.300- 15:07.220* :  Is that frustrating?
*15:07.700- 15:08.100* :  Not at all.
*15:08.100- 15:09.820* :  I'm going to have to disagree with you here.
*15:09.820- 15:15.320* :  I don't believe that most people look for the futility and lightness of gossip.
*15:15.320- 15:17.880* :  I think most humans want real human connection.
*15:18.180- 15:24.140* :  I think you've talked about the chaos and the downs of family life and marriage as being
*15:24.140- 15:29.420* :  important to make you appreciate the highs and the better things in life.
*15:29.740- 15:33.520* :  I think that's the dance of life per se in every human being between the light and the
*15:33.520- 15:35.300* :  darkness, the happiness, the unhappiness.
*15:35.300- 15:40.100* :  I think that that is kind of like what Leonard Cohen says, what creates a crack within
*15:40.100- 15:41.340* :  that's where the light comes in.
*15:41.520- 15:45.520* :  Not that we should search for conflict, not at all, but that we should maybe embrace
*15:45.520- 15:50.780* :  the difficult times with more certainty, knowing that we have the resilience as human
*15:50.780- 15:54.940* :  beings to walk through it and that if we stand closer to each other and we have each other's
*15:54.940- 16:00.140* :  minds and backs and hearts, we will be able to not only adapt as human beings, but thrive.
*16:00.440- 16:05.020* :  You've mentioned always seeing yourself first and foremost as an individual and being grounded.
*16:05.100- 16:11.180* :  When your husband was elected Canadian Prime Minister, you became a global celebrity couple.
*16:11.400- 16:12.660* :  You were called a golden couple.
*16:12.660- 16:14.060* :  How did that sit with you?
*16:14.160- 16:15.320* :  It must have had an effect.
*16:15.380- 16:17.140* :  I didn't believe that for a second.
*16:17.200- 16:18.520* :  That's not how I was raised.
*16:18.800- 16:20.900* :  Celebrity is a win of confusion and illusion.
*16:20.900- 16:25.560* :  The moment you believe in those titles and whatever surrounds you and all the adoration,
*16:25.560- 16:29.240* :  you're disconnected from yourself and I will not live from a place like that.
*16:29.240- 16:34.600* :  I choose to not only sense but experience that all human beings have the same value and
*16:34.600- 16:36.060* :  I'm not falling into that trap.
*16:36.200- 16:41.340* :  Your book was written before you separated from your husband, but I think you said you
*16:41.340- 16:43.360* :  have each other's back still, the love remains.
*16:43.540- 16:45.420* :  The love remains and it will always remain.
*16:46.240- 16:49.440* :  Sophie Greguartudo speaking to Paul Henley.
*16:52.300- 16:54.080* :  Still to calm on the global news podcast.
*17:02.400- 17:08.960* :  Why the Iranian authorities have banned the hugely popular Egyptian TV series called The
*17:09.140- 17:09.660* :  Assassins.
*17:17.320- 17:21.580* :  Australia's Prime Minister was in candid mood when he addressed protesters at a rally
*17:21.580- 17:23.600* :  in the capital Canberra on Sunday.
*17:24.120- 17:27.520* :  They were there demanding more action to tackle violence against women.
*17:28.120- 17:32.800* :  Anthony Albanese told them while his government had indeed not done enough to address the
*17:32.800- 17:38.400* :  problem, all of Australia's society had to change its culture and men had to change
*17:38.400- 17:39.140* :  their behaviour.
*17:39.640- 17:41.160* :  From Sydney, Katie Watson reports.
*17:41.860- 17:43.980* :  Katie and Australia must do better.
*17:43.980- 17:47.760* :  Was Anthony Albanese's message adding we need to change culture.
*17:47.760- 17:51.380* :  The attitudes, the legal system and the approach by all governments.
*17:51.960- 17:56.220* :  To a mixture of heckles and cheers, he added that this wasn't a problem for women alone
*17:56.220- 17:59.160* :  that it was up to men to change their behaviour as well.
*17:59.740- 18:06.440* :  We've got to be honest, it's not just government's problem, it's a problem of our entire society.
*18:09.320- 18:13.940* :  In Australia, a woman has been killed on average every four days so far this year.
*18:14.580- 18:18.880* :  Across the country, people at rallies this weekend have been holding up placards asking
*18:18.880- 18:23.700* :  that gender-based violence is considered a national emergency and strict laws are put
*18:23.700- 18:24.840* :  in place to stop it.
*18:25.280- 18:26.360* :  I'm really sick of it.
*18:27.480- 18:30.740* :  I'm sick of this and I don't want my future to continue being like this.
*18:31.720- 18:38.800* :  Yeah, it needs to start with the sun, the boys, because this behaviour is being perpetuated.
*18:39.540- 18:45.820* :  By centuries long from misogyny and we are the start, we are the beginning of change.
*18:47.360- 18:51.180* :  Mr Albanese has repeatedly called it an epidemic, but it's not new.
*18:51.180- 18:57.580* :  In 2021, marches took place across the country over allegations of sexual misconduct within
*18:57.580- 19:01.400* :  the government, but recent killings have put this issue back in the spotlight.
*19:02.040- 19:07.280* :  Earlier this month, a man stabbed six people to death in a shopping centre, five of them women
*19:07.740- 19:09.980* :  and the police are looking at whether they were the target.
*19:10.520- 19:14.380* :  Since then, several other women have died at the hands of men known to them.
*19:15.880- 19:16.520* :  Katie Watson.
*19:17.240- 19:21.880* :  The Irish government says it's bringing forward an emergency law which will allow them to send
*19:21.880- 19:27.420* :  asylum seekers arriving from the UK back over the border into Northern Ireland.
*19:27.500- 19:31.960* :  Dublin is blaming an influx of migrants on the British government's Rwanda scheme.
*19:32.580- 19:38.260* :  The UK law, passed on Thursday, aims to deter asylum seekers from crossing the English channel.
*19:38.420- 19:41.420* :  The plan is they'll be sent to Rwanda in Central Africa.
*19:42.220- 19:47.220* :  But a Westminster source says the British government won't accept any asylum returns from
*19:47.220- 19:52.500* :  European Union countries, including Ireland, until the EU allows Britain to send migrants
*19:52.500- 19:53.580* :  back to France.
*19:54.140- 19:56.920* :  A correspondent, Louise Cullen, reports from Belfast.
*19:57.340- 20:01.800* :  There are new formal checks on the movement of people across the land border between Northern
*20:01.800- 20:04.560* :  Ireland and the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
*20:05.080- 20:09.560* :  But since the development of the British government's Rwanda policy, Ireland has seen a surge
*20:09.560- 20:12.360* :  in the number of asylum seekers crossing that border.
*20:12.900- 20:17.540* :  The Irish Prime Minister, T-Shock Simon Harris, said Ireland would not be a loophole for
*20:17.540- 20:19.960* :  tackling the migration challenges of other countries.
*20:20.420- 20:25.700* :  Anybody else's migration policy can be allowed under mine hours, and I will be working
*20:25.700- 20:29.640* :  with the Minister for Justice, with our own law enforcement agencies and with government
*20:29.640- 20:31.620* :  colleagues to make sure that is the case.
*20:32.120- 20:35.160* :  So therefore, we will bring forward legislative proposals this week.
*20:35.160- 20:37.520* :  We did have a return agreement in place with the UK, I should say that.
*20:38.000- 20:41.240* :  But it does now require us updating our legislation, and we'll move to do that this week.
*20:41.540- 20:44.940* :  The proposed new law will be brought to the Irish Cabinet on Tuesday.
*20:45.560- 20:50.460* :  Speaking on Sky News, Rishi Sunak said that was evidence that his Rwanda plan, which
*20:50.460- 20:52.540* :  became law last Thursday, was working.
*20:53.060- 20:57.660* :  The deterrent is already having an impact, because people are worried about coming here,
*20:57.940- 20:59.600* :  and that demonstrates exactly what I'm saying.
*20:59.940- 21:05.100* :  If people come to our country illegally, but know that they won't be able to stay, they're
*21:05.100- 21:06.380* :  much less likely to come.
*21:06.600- 21:10.900* :  The Irish Justice Minister Helen McIntee is due to meet the British home secretary, James
*21:10.900- 21:14.540* :  Cleverley, tomorrow, and has signaled her intention to raise the issue.
*21:15.060- 21:15.740* :  Louise Cullen.
*21:16.680- 21:21.620* :  The Iranian authorities have banned a popular Egyptian television series, accusing it of
*21:21.620- 21:23.440* :  having abised approach to history.
*21:24.020- 21:29.380* :  The assassins was a big hit, this Ramadan, which is traditionally when high-profile television
*21:29.380- 21:32.300* :  series are broadcast across the Arab world.
*21:42.660- 21:47.660* :  The series tells the story of an Ismaili Shia Muslim sect that carried out political
*21:47.660- 21:51.860* :  killings in the 11th century, from which the word assassin is derived.
*21:52.540- 21:58.040* :  According to legend, their young men were brainwashed by stays in a heavenly garden, and
*21:58.040- 22:02.960* :  intoxicating drugs, after which they were willing to sacrifice their lives for their leader.
*22:03.820- 22:09.700* :  Dr. Chenil Jiwap of the Institute of Ismaili Studies in London helped Julian Marshall sort
*22:09.700- 22:11.400* :  out fact from fiction.
*22:11.780- 22:19.380* :  So the New Zahari Ismailis come from the Fatimid dynasty in Egypt, which ruled all together
*22:19.380- 22:24.180* :  in the region from 9 or 9 till 1171.
*22:24.980- 22:30.920* :  There was a split from within the Fatimid family itself in terms of succession, and one
*22:30.920- 22:39.540* :  group followed a Nizar, his eldest son, Al-Mustansir Bilaz, eldest son, and took refuge in Iran
*22:39.800- 22:40.600* :  and in Syria.
*22:41.100- 22:49.380* :  And that is the origin of the Nizari Ismailis, who later in some resources and in Oriental
*22:49.380- 22:55.500* :  Ismaili's literature come to be referred to as the Hashishin and then the Assassins.
*22:55.760- 23:03.600* :  That then eventually enters into the tales that Marco Polotel's to his companion, while
*23:03.600- 23:11.380* :  he was imprisoned in Genoa, where this idea that there were these people who gave their
*23:11.380- 23:15.440* :  lives for the cause under the influence of Hashish.
*23:15.840- 23:21.780* :  And that eventually enters into the English language as Assassins.
*23:22.600- 23:27.680* :  And the legends that surrounded this group came to be read as a fact as it were.
*23:27.860- 23:31.500* :  So you're saying that there are just legends about the Assassins.
*23:31.860- 23:39.280* :  There is a group called the Nizari Ismailis, but the way the narrative has then got yarned
*23:39.280- 23:46.020* :  over centuries, has put in a lot of other interpretations and has dramatized it.
*23:46.400- 23:51.880* :  So there never was a group you're saying to me that carried out targeted killings of its
*23:51.880- 23:52.580* :  opponents?
*23:52.980- 23:58.400* :  They did carry out targeted killings of their opponents because they were a very small
*23:58.400- 24:05.640* :  group now residing under the Seljuks who were clearly their adversaries.
*24:06.220- 24:09.780* :  So they couldn't have armies like they did under the Fatimids.
*24:09.780- 24:14.580* :  They were a very persecuted small minority group living in the mountains.
*24:15.340- 24:23.420* :  So one of the ways that they survived was to kill their key opponents from time to time.
*24:23.740- 24:25.520* :  And I mean, who were the perceived enemies?
*24:26.220- 24:33.760* :  Crusaders, the Seljuks and the Fatimids as well because those who continued in the Fatimid
*24:33.760- 24:38.900* :  line were very threatened by the Nizari Ismailis.
*24:39.260- 24:44.520* :  You've had a chance to see this Egyptian TV series called The Assassins.
*24:44.960- 24:45.900* :  What did you think of it?
*24:46.000- 24:47.780* :  It's a very dramatized version.
*24:47.780- 24:54.280* :  It's a way of presenting some snippets of truth with a lot of legend and fabrications
*24:54.280- 24:59.000* :  and stories around it that make it, you know, a racey watch.
*24:59.460- 25:03.000* :  And why do you think the Iranians would want to ban it?
*25:03.240- 25:08.760* :  Would seem to be a rather negative portrayal of Shia Muslims at some point during their
*25:08.800- 25:09.280* :  history?
*25:09.500- 25:10.240* :  Absolutely.
*25:10.260- 25:15.220* :  That would be a very fair statement to make that it is a negative portrayal of Shia.
*25:15.780- 25:23.660* :  And that is a historical legacy because the majority of Muslim historiography was written
*25:23.660- 25:28.600* :  by the New Yorkers, so you do get the bias in the sources.
*25:29.600- 25:31.040* :  Dr. Shaynau Jiwa.
*25:31.860- 25:35.540* :  Known in the literary world as the Arabic Booker, it's been announced that this year's
*25:35.540- 25:40.680* :  International Prize for Arabic Fiction has gone to the Palestinian author, Basim Kandachi.
*25:41.260- 25:46.100* :  He wasn't at the ceremony in Abu Dhabi to collect his prize because he's in jail in Israel
*25:46.100- 25:48.740* :  and has been there for the last 20 years.
*25:49.280- 25:51.160* :  Vincent Dow told me more about the winner.
*25:51.500- 25:54.680* :  Basim Kandachi was born in Nablus in 1983.
*25:54.780- 26:00.440* :  He studied journalism and he was already writing stories when he was given three life sentences
*26:01.020- 26:05.800* :  having been found guilty of taking part in a lethal bombing in Tel Aviv at the famous
*26:05.800- 26:10.700* :  Carmel market ever since he's been in various Israeli jails.
*26:11.000- 26:15.860* :  Throughout he's been registered as a student at Al-Quds University studying political science.
*26:15.900- 26:19.580* :  He's already published volumes of verse and novels.
*26:19.580- 26:23.620* :  Obviously he's going to get far more publicity for this, very briefly the story.
*26:23.620- 26:28.500* :  It's about a man who's a Palestinian archaeologist who lives in a refugee camp in Ramallah.
*26:28.900- 26:33.960* :  In the story, he stumbles across a piece of Israeli ID in an old coat.
*26:34.340- 26:36.160* :  That's the mask of the title.
*26:36.340- 26:41.300* :  That allows him to sample Israeli identity to feel what it's like not to be a Palestinian
*26:41.820- 26:42.120* :  briefly.
*26:42.320- 26:43.340* :  That's the basic setup.
*26:43.820- 26:47.180* :  And how controversial do you think this win will be?
*26:47.420- 26:48.640* :  That's a very good question.
*26:48.740- 26:52.840* :  Well, the international prize for Arabic fiction has existed since 2008.
*26:52.840- 26:55.780* :  The idea is to choose the best novel each year.
*26:55.940- 26:57.800* :  In Arabic, it's all based in Abu Dhabi.
*26:57.800- 27:03.320* :  The organizers want Arabic writing to be more familiar to people in the rest of the world.
*27:03.760- 27:09.540* :  And they get a translation for the winning novel so far you might think so uncontroversial.
*27:10.060- 27:15.000* :  But this time I think it may be a bit different because look at what's going on in international politics.
*27:15.380- 27:19.880* :  So the comments made by the judging committee normally actually pretty bland most years have
*27:20.140- 27:21.140* :  sharp teeth this year.
*27:21.180- 27:26.780* :  Nabil Suleiman the chairman said a mask, the color of the sky, this book, fuses the personal
*27:26.780- 27:28.680* :  and the political in innovating ways.
*27:29.220- 27:33.940* :  It dissects a complex bitter reality of displacement, genocide and erasism.
*27:33.940- 27:37.860* :  It's stirred by a desire for freedom from oppression.
*27:37.860- 27:40.380* :  Those are much stronger words than you normally get.
*27:40.960- 27:44.620* :  Vincent Dowd on the winner of the international prize for Arabic fiction,
*27:45.160- 27:46.200* :  Basim Kandachi.
*27:47.560- 27:53.660* :  Japan's tourism industry is booming with more than 3 million overseas travelers visiting just last month.
*27:54.300- 27:59.740* :  While many in the country are celebrating the impressive numbers and the economic benefits that come with it,
*28:00.120- 28:04.600* :  some neighborhoods are looking for new ways to discourage the often disruptive tourists.
*28:05.420- 28:10.160* :  One time famous for beautiful views of Mount Fuji has decided enough is enough.
*28:10.260- 28:15.100* :  This week it will start building a fence with the aim of ruining photo opportunities.
*28:15.800- 28:17.200* :  Is where the jewel takes up the story.
*28:17.540- 28:19.000* :  It's an iconic image.
*28:19.000- 28:25.720* :  Japan's snow-dusted Mount Fuji standing tall behind the low roof of a glowing convenience store.
*28:26.780- 28:31.160* :  Hordes of tourists flock every day to the street outside the Lawson chain store
*28:31.360- 28:33.940* :  in the small town of Fuji Kawaguchi-ko.
*28:34.960- 28:39.020* :  I'm here at Kawaguchi-ko station and we're about to explore Mount Fuji.
*28:39.920- 28:41.160* :  Thoughts, let's go.
*28:41.840- 28:43.760* :  Armed with smartphones and cameras,
*28:44.280- 28:48.860* :  they're all hoping to bag the bucket list photo that will light up their social media.
*28:49.180- 28:52.960* :  Everybody's just here taking photos of this Lawson over here.
*28:53.820- 28:57.780* :  And this is a famous TikTok Instagram content creator's spot.
*28:58.120- 29:03.380* :  But these tourists and influencers are building a bad reputation with local authorities
*29:04.140- 29:05.420* :  and the town's residents.
*29:06.100- 29:11.980* :  Fuji Kawaguchi-ko officials say that despite putting up signs and hiring security guards,
*29:12.460- 29:15.260* :  many tourists refuse to respect the rules of the town,
*29:15.740- 29:19.880* :  overcrowding the pavements, standing in the way of traffic and leaving litter behind.
*29:20.800- 29:25.520* :  Some have even climbed on the roofs of nearby businesses for a better view of Mount Fuji.
*29:26.320- 29:30.520* :  So on Friday, the authorities there announced a dramatic new plan.
*29:31.100- 29:35.100* :  As soon as next week they'll begin building a two and a half meter tall net
*29:35.540- 29:37.100* :  stretching 20 meters long.
*29:37.700- 29:41.160* :  The aim is to ruin the view at the popular photo spot
*29:41.660- 29:44.320* :  and therefore dissuade the crowds of tourists from coming.
*29:45.300- 29:49.100* :  An official said the town wished it hadn't been forced to take such an action,
*29:49.140- 29:52.700* :  but that the screen would stay up until the situation improved.
*29:53.780- 29:56.900* :  This isn't Japan's first attempt to control overtourism.
*29:57.320- 30:01.020* :  Earlier this year, visitors were banned from parts of Kyoto's Gacha district
*30:01.560- 30:04.340* :  and now hikers must pay to climb Mount Fuji.
*30:05.080- 30:12.120* :  But in Fuji Kawaguchi-ko, locals will be hoping this move will make their weekly shop a little less crowded.
*30:13.980- 30:15.260* :  Isabella Jewel reporting.
