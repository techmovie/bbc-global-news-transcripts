*01:25.200- 01:30.100* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday the 26th of September,
*01:30.420- 01:31.560* :  these are our main stories.
*01:31.560- 01:36.740* :  Israel's Prime Minister has told the military to continue striking Hezbollah in Lebanon
*01:36.740- 01:40.460* :  with full force, despite international calls for a ceasefire.
*01:40.840- 01:45.920* :  President Biden has announced he's releasing nearly $8 billion of assistance for Ukraine.
*01:46.700- 01:51.580* :  The world's longest-serving death row prisoner has been acquitted on a retrial in Japan.
*01:54.140- 01:54.860* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:03.740- 02:09.420* :  speaking from beyond the grave was this the likely voice and language of England's
*02:09.440- 02:12.720* :  King Richard III who died in 1485.
*02:17.600- 02:22.480* :  The world is waiting to see if international pressure for a three-week ceasefire between Israel
*02:22.480- 02:25.720* :  and Hezbollah will be accepted by both sides.
*02:26.160- 02:30.580* :  The proposed 21-day pause in fighting has been welcomed by the Lebanese Prime Minister,
*02:31.000- 02:33.820* :  but is still likely to happen only if other demands are met.
*02:34.400- 02:38.380* :  Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Lebanese and Israelis have been displaced.
*02:38.740- 02:43.400* :  The Secretary-General Antone Guterres warned the situation in Lebanon is dark.
*02:43.920- 02:46.120* :  Hell is breaking loose in Lebanon.
*02:46.740- 02:48.820* :  We should all be alarmed by the escalation.
*02:49.780- 02:51.380* :  Lebanon is at the brink.
*02:52.120- 02:58.300* :  Since October, nearly 200,000 people within Lebanon and over 60,000 from Northern Israel
*02:58.300- 03:03.620* :  have fled their homes. Many lives have been lost. All these must stop.
*03:04.360- 03:06.740* :  So, what are the prospects for a ceasefire?
*03:07.060- 03:10.200* :  The BBC's Middle East correspondent, Yolain Nell, is in Jerusalem.
*03:10.840- 03:15.020* :  And we've had now a short statement from the Israeli Prime Minister's office
*03:15.660- 03:19.960* :  dismissing some reports that are circulating of a ceasefire as being incorrect.
*03:19.960- 03:24.160* :  It says that the Prime Minister has not even responded to this proposal coming
*03:24.160- 03:27.160* :  primarily from the US and from France.
*03:27.180- 03:32.560* :  And it said that there's reports about a purported directive to ease up on fighting in the north.
*03:32.560- 03:34.240* :  That's the opposite of the truth.
*03:34.240- 03:39.620* :  The Prime Minister has directed the Israeli military to continue fighting with full force
*03:40.080- 03:43.880* :  and saying that this will continue until objectives are met in Gaza as well.
*03:43.880- 03:46.420* :  Now, the objectives on the northern front for Israel
*03:46.420- 03:52.520* :  it has said is to return 60,000 displaced Israelis to their homes on the Lebanese border.
*03:52.520- 03:56.300* :  These are people who have been displaced by the cross-border fighting between
*03:57.260- 04:02.920* :  Hasbonler and Israeli forces that has gone on in parallel to the war in Gaza.
*04:03.480- 04:08.960* :  And, you know, Israel has not dismissed the idea of a diplomatic solution
*04:09.440- 04:11.040* :  to get people back to their homes.
*04:11.040- 04:14.400* :  But at the same time, it's definitely keeping military options open.
*04:14.420- 04:18.640* :  And that's why we've heard in the past couple of days even as two more
*04:18.640- 04:23.960* :  reservist brigades, infantry brigades have been moved to the northern front on short notice.
*04:24.240- 04:27.300* :  We've had also the Israeli military's chief of staff, other commanders
*04:28.060- 04:31.300* :  talking to ground forces, basically telling them to prepare
*04:31.300- 04:33.400* :  for a possible military incursion.
*04:33.400- 04:37.160* :  The chief of staff said military boots will enter enemy territory.
*04:37.660- 04:42.900* :  But we understand that Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu is on the way to the United States
*04:42.900- 04:47.020* :  where he's going to meet President Joe Biden, where presumably this will all be discussed.
*04:47.020- 04:50.940* :  Of course, and it was interesting that while the Prime Minister is often
*04:51.460- 04:55.780* :  somebody who likes to leave a message before he departs the country,
*04:55.780- 05:00.000* :  especially to things like the UN General Assembly, where he's expected to give his
*05:00.320- 05:06.660* :  address on Friday, he chose not to speak even though this report of a ceasefire
*05:07.000- 05:10.300* :  was already well in the works by the time he left Israel.
*05:11.160- 05:16.120* :  We have had a lower intensity of fighting, especially earlier in the day than we've seen in
*05:16.120- 05:22.600* :  the previous three days of this week. But you know, there were 75 reported strikes
*05:23.080- 05:25.560* :  by the Israeli military on Lebanon overnight.
*05:25.560- 05:30.780* :  We've been hearing about more strikes taking place with details yet to fully come through
*05:31.700- 05:36.420* :  with strikes even in the north of Lebanon. We're told by media reports,
*05:36.420- 05:42.360* :  after has well-affired rockets about 30 were intercepted in the skies above acre and high
*05:42.360- 05:46.980* :  for bay. So it does show that this fighting still goes on and across the political spectrum,
*05:46.980- 05:51.360* :  we're seeing a lot of pushback against the diplomatic deal that's currently on the table.
*05:52.100- 05:56.840* :  While the waiting continues for the outcome of negotiations, let's hear more about what's
*05:56.840- 06:01.400* :  happening on the ground. I'm at least correspondent Yuga Bachega is in the Lebanese capital,
*06:01.400- 06:06.720* :  they route. Well, the country has been paralyzed by what's happening. Schools have been
*06:06.720- 06:11.400* :  shared classes have been suspended. Many schools have been turned into shelters here in Beirut
*06:11.800- 06:16.780* :  for the displaced residents coming, especially from the south. We've seen that tens of thousands
*06:16.780- 06:22.260* :  of people have now fled villages and towns in the south of the country because of the intensity
*06:22.820- 06:29.040* :  of these Israeli air strikes. And the authorities are warning that this has put a lot of pressure
*06:29.040- 06:35.840* :  on public services and especially on hospitals. I think it was you know there was a warning
*06:35.840- 06:43.040* :  yesterday from the prime minister who said that hospitals are unable to treat people because of
*06:43.040- 06:49.880* :  the sheer number of casualties from these Israeli attacks. So a lot of pressure on Lebanon and
*06:49.880- 06:56.620* :  obviously if the situation escalates and if there is let's say a ground offensive by the Israeli
*06:56.620- 07:02.280* :  military, this situation could get even worse. So what are people there saying to you?
*07:02.840- 07:10.800* :  We've been to a shelter here in Beirut and 6,000 people were there yesterday. And obviously
*07:10.800- 07:16.160* :  people were talking about the intensity of the attacks. Many of them were carrying just you know
*07:16.620- 07:22.100* :  some bags with some belongings. They said they didn't have time to collect some of the
*07:22.100- 07:27.900* :  possessions. And I think the fear here is that some of them may never be able to go back home,
*07:27.900- 07:34.580* :  especially if there is this Israeli ground offensive. There's been speculation that this is the
*07:34.580- 07:41.040* :  plan of the Israeli military to push his polar fighters away from the border. And many people here
*07:41.040- 07:47.640* :  told us that they have nowhere to go. So again these schools, these public facilities have been
*07:47.640- 07:53.460* :  turned into shelters. And you know there is a lot of uncertainty about what is going to happen
*07:53.460- 07:58.940* :  next for thousands of those people who are now have been displaced because of this conflict.
*07:59.500- 08:05.240* :  And what are the authorities in Beirut where you are? What are they saying? How are they trying
*08:05.240- 08:11.280* :  to keep people calm? We are hearing from Lebanese officials who are saying that it is urgent to
*08:11.280- 08:16.860* :  reach this ceasefire. They say that the country is under attack. I think this is the feeling
*08:16.860- 08:23.860* :  here. This is the mood. Here it's not only Hezbollah that has been affected by these airstrikes,
*08:23.860- 08:29.020* :  by these attacks that have been carried out by Israel. There is a feeling that the entire country
*08:29.500- 08:35.900* :  is being attacked. And I think the main concern here is that we could see an escalation instead
*08:35.900- 08:42.560* :  of de-escalation. Yuga Bachega in Beirut and before him we heard from Yulan Nell in Jerusalem.
*08:43.820- 08:48.700* :  President Biden has announced he is releasing nearly 8 billion dollars of assistance for Ukraine
*08:48.700- 08:54.380* :  ahead of a meeting with President Vladimir Zelensky in Washington. In a statement Mr Biden said all
*08:54.380- 08:59.220* :  the remaining security funds that had been set aside for Ukraine would be released by the end
*08:59.220- 09:04.820* :  of his term. It comes amid signs that were Donald Trump to win November's U.S. presidential election
*09:04.820- 09:09.380* :  he might cut funds to Kiev. More details from Danny Eberhardt.
*09:09.680- 09:14.620* :  President Biden has announced another Patriot battery and more Patriot missiles to boost Ukraine's
*09:14.620- 09:19.360* :  air defenses. A type of long-range glide bomb that will be transferred for the first time
*09:19.360- 09:25.640* :  and more training for Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 fighter jets. President Zelensky has welcomed
*09:25.640- 09:31.000* :  the package as a step to ensuring Ukraine's victory. But what he no doubt really wants is
*09:31.000- 09:36.440* :  permission to use advanced Western weapons to strike targets inside Russia to better protect
*09:36.440- 09:42.740* :  his compatriots, energy system and armed forces who are under extreme pressure. There's no word yet
*09:42.740- 09:48.700* :  on that. Danny Eberhardt. A Japanese man who spent decades facing the death penalty has been
*09:48.700- 09:54.660* :  acquitted and retrial. Iwa Uha Kamada, who's 88 years old, is believed to be the world's longest
*09:54.660- 10:00.960* :  serving death row in mate. In 1968 he was convicted of murdering his boss, the man's wife,
*10:00.960- 10:08.920* :  and their two children. Shama Khalil is in Tokyo. The judge apologized to the sister of Iwa Uha Kamada
*10:08.920- 10:15.640* :  Hiddeko, his 91-year-old sister, who has long been attending these trials because of his ill
*10:15.640- 10:20.540* :  health. The judge said, I'm sorry for taking so long for the court to proceed. And this is
*10:20.540- 10:27.920* :  precisely because it has taken decades for this legal saga to end. This is an acquitil for a man
*10:27.920- 10:34.580* :  that has spent more time awaiting execution than anyone else in the world. And today Iwa Uha Kamada
*10:35.440- 10:43.500* :  was found innocent. And I think the one thing that this case has hinged on is whether the evidence
*10:43.500- 10:48.840* :  had been fabricated. The lawyers, the defense lawyers have been arguing that for years about the
*10:48.840- 10:54.940* :  credibility of the evidence essentially that the red stains found on clothes that were set to be
*10:54.940- 11:00.260* :  worn by the killer, the alleged killer, could not have been blood, because blood would not remain
*11:00.260- 11:10.060* :  that color red on clothing after it was immersed in miso for years. So the nature of the blood
*11:10.060- 11:14.700* :  stains was the argument. And there was a lot of back and forth between the defense and the
*11:14.700- 11:21.780* :  prosecution who kept insisting on the death penalty for Mr. Hakamada. A key date, I would say,
*11:22.580- 11:27.920* :  2014. He was released from jail. He was granted retrial. And then there was a lot of back and forth
*11:27.920- 11:33.760* :  again between the high court and the district court. And it took until last year for the retrial
*11:33.760- 11:40.560* :  to be re-granted and then today for him to be announced innocent. And after facing the death penalty
*11:40.560- 11:46.900* :  for more than half a century, how is he now? Mentally. He is not well at all support his sister,
*11:47.500- 11:51.860* :  supporters and rights advocates have for years criticized the way that he's been treated.
*11:51.860- 11:58.940* :  Remember, he has been in solitary confinement awaiting execution day in and day out for nearly
*11:58.940- 12:04.340* :  half a century before he was released in 2014. And those who are close to him have said that it
*12:04.340- 12:09.860* :  really impaired him and really deeply affected his mental health. His sister today, Hidako,
*12:10.460- 12:17.860* :  was quite emotional in court. She was smiling outside court. But of course, the question here is
*12:17.860- 12:23.780* :  how aware he is of what's happening. Since he was released, he was under her care, under her
*12:23.780- 12:29.520* :  supervision because of his ill health and because of his mental health. And I think a wider story
*12:29.520- 12:35.760* :  here and something that has been raised by rights advocates is not only how long it lasted,
*12:35.760- 12:42.520* :  but the nature of how he was treated. And of course, the fact that Japan, only Japan and the
*12:42.520- 12:50.160* :  United States are the two countries in the G7 in the G7 states that still adopt the the capital
*12:50.160- 12:56.260* :  punishment. Shama Khalil, he's one of England's most controversial monarchs. Richard III is the
*12:56.260- 13:02.620* :  last king of England to die in battle at Bosworth in 1485. He was suspected of being behind the death
*13:02.620- 13:08.160* :  of two young royals, the princes in the tower who disappeared from the Tower of London in 1483
*13:08.160- 13:13.280* :  where they'd been placed for their safety. Now Richard is set to speak from beyond the grave
*13:13.280- 13:18.700* :  after scientists use the shape of his head and knowledge of medieval speech patterns and
*13:18.700- 13:22.700* :  language to recreate his voice. Stephanie Prentice has this report.
*13:33.180- 13:42.520* :  And like this. But now a new study says that instead of speaking with what people in the UK
*13:42.520- 13:49.360* :  may call a partial aristocratic accent, Richard would in fact have had a broad accent with flat
*13:49.360- 13:55.880* :  vowels, similar to England's famous Yorkshire tones. A team of researchers examined his skull
*13:55.880- 14:01.680* :  in depth and tracked speech patterns of the time, bringing together linguists and anatomy
*14:01.680- 14:08.980* :  experts. And after 10 years of back and forth, they've released a clip of how they think he would
*14:08.980- 14:17.820* :  have sounded. And madam, the athlete decides yet that you may often hear from you, to be comfort.
*14:18.920- 14:23.020* :  At such a young age as being near meets their vote, how has Britain?
*14:23.640- 14:28.400* :  The new development was all made possible after Richard's skeleton was found in 2012
*14:28.400- 14:35.280* :  underneath a car park in England's Midlands. The dig revealed Richard had a deformed spine,
*14:35.280- 14:41.120* :  giving credence to William Shakespeare's depiction of him as a hunchback. And crucially,
*14:41.120- 14:47.440* :  the skull also allowed forensic archaeologists to recreate how his face might have looked.
*14:48.320- 14:54.080* :  Next month, the team plan to hold an event to let people hear his voice using a moving breathing
*14:54.080- 15:03.620* :  dummy. And historians have said that hearing his accent will make the former monarch more
*15:03.620- 15:08.680* :  relatable. And the team of scientists say they're bringing the last king of the
*15:08.680- 15:14.920* :  Plantagenet dynasty back to life. Stephanie Prentice on England's King Richard III.
*15:17.280- 15:22.940* :  Still to come on this podcast. Then I felt this thing come from underneath me and grabbed me,
*15:23.220- 15:28.960* :  and my heart sank, and then I was dragged underwater in its jaws, and taken down to the bottom
*15:28.960- 15:34.920* :  of the river. One man's lucky escape after surviving a hippo attack in Zambia.

*16:48.980- 16:51.180* :  Let's return to the situation in the Middle East.
*16:51.180- 16:56.940* :  Israel's ambassador to the UN says his country doesn't want a full-scale war with Hezbollah and
*16:56.940- 17:03.060* :  Lebanon, but won't stand by as Israel's northern region is attacked. Israel says its citizens
*17:03.060- 17:07.600* :  have a right to live in peace, and returning displaced civilians to communities along the border
*17:07.880- 17:13.780* :  is now one of its principal war aims. Around 60,000 Israelis have been away from their homes since
*17:13.780- 17:19.740* :  last October. They were evacuated when Hezbollah started firing rockets over the border at the
*17:19.740- 17:25.100* :  start of the war in Gaza. For the past year, around 200 evacuees have been living in a hotel
*17:25.100- 17:31.120* :  at Kibbutz-Lavi just west of the city of Tiberius. With a war raging just to the north,
*17:31.480- 17:34.380* :  a diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams has been to visit.
*17:37.440- 17:41.100* :  It's an incongruous scene, a dance party in a bomb shelter.
*17:44.520- 17:50.400* :  After a year of life at Kibbutz-Lavi, they're mixing play with safety, trying for a while,
*17:51.020- 17:53.220* :  not to think about what's going on outside.
*17:59.460- 18:04.460* :  Rahel Rahameem is here with her husband and five children. They're from Kiryat Shmona,
*18:04.820- 18:07.760* :  30 miles north of here, right on the Lebanese border.
*18:08.500- 18:12.600* :  We thought it's safe here, but all of the sudden, past two weeks, you are running
*18:12.980- 18:15.880* :  back and forth to the shelter with the kids. How are the kids?
*18:16.840- 18:22.060* :  They are scared too. They are afraid that there is going to be a siren in the middle of the
*18:22.060- 18:28.580* :  night and we won't hear it. I will be confident to send my kids to go back to Kiryat Shmona when I
*18:28.580- 18:33.400* :  can send my kids on the school bus without worrying to death.
*18:38.300- 18:45.300* :  Up the road in Kiryat Shmona, some buses are running, but there's no one on them. A city of 24,000
*18:45.300- 18:51.240* :  people is mostly deserted. Lebanon is just a couple of miles away across the mountain that
*18:51.240- 18:58.220* :  towers over the city. Kiryat Shmona is battle scarred. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged by
*18:58.220- 19:03.420* :  the rockets that arrive, usually with no more than a few seconds, notice from across the border.
*19:05.080- 19:13.820* :  This is a house that was hit some months ago and when you go inside, it is a complete wreck.
*19:13.820- 19:19.760* :  We're here with Major Doran Spielman, a spokesman for the Israeli military. The army he says is
*19:19.760- 19:24.580* :  determined to do whatever it takes to enable Israeli civilians to return to their homes.
*19:25.300- 19:29.240* :  So you're looking at over a hundred homes in Kiryat Shmona, look like this,
*19:30.020- 19:32.860* :  or families if they had lived here would have been wiped out in an instant.
*19:33.760- 19:39.400* :  This is what Israel is fighting for. His bullet is going to have to move back from the border of
*19:39.400- 19:45.140* :  Israel. The only way these people are ever going to come back home is if his bullet is nowhere even close
*19:45.140- 19:49.600* :  where they can shoot them again. Back at Kibbutz-Lavi, the hotel manager, Moshi Gold,
*19:50.080- 19:53.700* :  shows me how he and his staff are looking after their visitors from the border.
*19:54.520- 19:59.720* :  He clearly cares deeply about them. Does he have time, I wonder, to think about what's happening
*19:59.720- 20:07.660* :  on the other side? We see the pictures at the TV. I'm not happy for what I see, but now I have my own
*20:07.660- 20:15.440* :  problems. We reach this point, not because we started it or we wanted it. We've been dragged
*20:15.440- 20:22.380* :  to this thing after what happened in the South. And I'm very sorry, but now I have to take care
*20:22.380- 20:27.940* :  of my own people, my own responsibility. Well, let's cross the border again. We're more than
*20:27.940- 20:32.980* :  a hundred thousand Lebanese people have been forced to seek shelter further north. Schools
*20:32.980- 20:37.740* :  and offices in Beirut have been turned into temporary shelters for them. Eddie Higgins is from
*20:37.740- 20:43.320* :  the Children's Charity Unicef and has been helping set them up. Every day the number of shelters
*20:43.320- 20:49.140* :  is increasing. As of last night we had 250 new shelters that are opening to accommodate.
*20:50.220- 20:56.000* :  All of these very traumatized internally displaced people and they're opening and entering
*20:56.000- 21:01.680* :  shelters in the South and Beirut in Mount Lebanon right across the country. And the situation in
*21:01.680- 21:08.060* :  these shelters is really dire. These are schools. They're not meant to accommodate and house people
*21:08.060- 21:14.060* :  for long periods of time. We're currently distributing mattresses, blankets, winter clothing
*21:14.060- 21:20.640* :  kits for children. Since many children just fled with the clothes that are on their back, leaving behind
*21:20.640- 21:29.120* :  their belongings, their medications, documentation. So it's really extremely concerning the amount
*21:29.120- 21:33.500* :  of fear that we're witnessing amongst children that we're receiving in these shelters.
*21:34.200- 21:39.000* :  And in fact, I can tell you, many of the shelters are already full. As of last night,
*21:39.000- 21:45.420* :  there was more than 50,000 people who are now housed in these shelters and more on the streets.
*21:46.120- 21:51.540* :  So we're desperately trying now and working under extremely difficult conditions to support
*21:51.540- 21:56.560* :  these thousands of displaced mainly women and children. Eddie Higgins from Unicef.
*21:57.300- 22:02.320* :  The Sudanese army has launched a major offensive against the paramilitary rapid support forces
*22:02.320- 22:07.520* :  targeting areas in the capital. It lost 17 months ago at the start of the conflict.
*22:07.520- 22:11.760* :  What details from Richard Gagoy? Witnesses have reported intense
*22:11.760- 22:16.600* :  bombardments and heavy fighting, as army troops crossed two key bridges over the Nal River,
*22:16.600- 22:21.980* :  previously separating parts of the capital held by the army from areas under RSF control.
*22:22.060- 22:27.160* :  Woblin Structe Centre Hartoom, where RSF forces had seized territory from the army.
*22:27.660- 22:30.820* :  The army has struggled to reclaim areas held by the paramilitaries,
*22:31.140- 22:36.460* :  relying heavily on artillery and airstrikes to dislodge RSF troops entrenched across the capital.
*22:37.140- 22:41.860* :  Richard Gagoy. The Chinese government has announced sweeping measures to boost the
*22:41.860- 22:46.140* :  country's struggling economy. The Politburo promised more government investment,
*22:46.140- 22:50.400* :  as well as cuts to interest rates. There also pledges for more jobs.
*22:50.980- 22:54.460* :  Areasia Pacific Correspondent Stephen McDonald spoke to us from Beijing.
*22:55.100- 23:00.760* :  Well, the main thing that's been promised today from the Politburo is for the government to
*23:01.200- 23:06.920* :  somehow get a hold of the real estate crisis. Now, there's such a big deal here because
*23:06.920- 23:12.200* :  real estate sector was a quarter of the most domestic product of all of China a couple of years ago,
*23:12.540- 23:18.440* :  and it's been in terrible state for years. What they've tried, what they've said today they're
*23:18.440- 23:24.460* :  going to do, is to strictly control any increase in new commercial housing construction.
*23:24.860- 23:30.600* :  Now, the reason that is seen as maybe working is that up until now, these developers have been
*23:30.600- 23:35.500* :  going further and further into debt, building forests of towers in places people don't want them
*23:35.500- 23:40.580* :  to somehow stay ahead of the creditors, and it's forced value of all these homes to drop
*23:40.580- 23:45.940* :  there's too many of them in the wrong places, and so if you control it a bit, the idea is that
*23:45.940- 23:50.120* :  it'll drive up the process of the places they're already there, it'll force the developers to
*23:50.120- 23:54.680* :  finish the ones that haven't finished, and they're an awful lot of them, and restore confidence in
*23:54.680- 23:59.560* :  the housing market. Well, you've mentioned the housing crisis, I mean, you live there, how bad are
*23:59.560- 24:04.920* :  things for people in China? It depends, but for some people it's terrible there, you imagine you
*24:04.920- 24:10.800* :  seek your life savings into buying a new flat and your apartment off the plan, as you would say,
*24:11.580- 24:16.500* :  before it's even finished, and some developer, because they've run out of money, hasn't even
*24:16.500- 24:22.380* :  delivered it, and in the worst cases you've had sometimes people camping in the shells of their
*24:22.380- 24:27.880* :  unfinished apartments, in these concrete structures with no windows, which is gas lamps and things,
*24:27.880- 24:32.400* :  no electricity, they're desperate, they are, so for them it's been terrible. Then on top of that,
*24:32.400- 24:37.460* :  you've got youth unemployment, huge problem, you've got the fact that people aren't spending
*24:37.460- 24:43.080* :  enough, and you've got a problem also of deflation. There's such a lack of confidence in the economy
*24:43.560- 24:47.360* :  that people, even though you've got money, are waiting to buy things, because they can see the
*24:47.360- 24:51.600* :  value of everything dropping, the longer they wait, the more the value drops, the more the value
*24:51.600- 24:56.320* :  drops, the longer they wait, and it's a bit of a vicious cycle at the moment. And will these plans
*24:56.320- 25:00.260* :  from the Chinese government do you think they'll be enough to save the economy or make a big difference
*25:00.260- 25:06.020* :  anyway? Well, this is the big question. I mean, one of the things that was announced two days ago
*25:06.020- 25:11.420* :  by the Reserve Bank here is that they were going to limit, reduce the amount, rather that commercial
*25:11.420- 25:16.620* :  banks had to hold back in terms of their reserve funds, freeing up more money for the banks to lend
*25:16.620- 25:21.020* :  to ordinary families. The problem is ordinary families don't necessarily want to borrow money,
*25:21.280- 25:26.180* :  because they don't have any faith in the economy anyway, even though that might work as a bit of
*25:26.220- 25:31.860* :  stimulus, what it requires is a whole change in attitudes here, and that's going to take time
*25:31.860- 25:36.460* :  to turn around, especially as the government tries to drag this economy out of the way it was,
*25:36.460- 25:39.600* :  it's the way they want it to go. It's a painful process and could take time.
*25:40.260- 25:46.400* :  Stephen McDonald. Around the world, movie goers are bulking at the rising price of refreshments
*25:46.400- 25:51.620* :  at cinemas. In some instances, sneaking in their own snacks and drinks to avoid the high charges.
*25:52.220- 25:56.960* :  Now, some cinema chains are being investigated for unfair pricing. From New York,
*25:57.140- 26:00.040* :  Tom Brook visited his local cinema to find out more.
*26:05.900- 26:09.940* :  Buying refreshments when you go to the movies, whether it's a soft drink or popcorn,
*26:09.940- 26:15.500* :  is a long, much cherished practice, but nowadays it really can set you back financially.
*26:17.900- 26:23.940* :  I've just paid a visit to my local cinema here in New York. I spent $18 for a ticket to see a
*26:23.940- 26:28.880* :  feature film. I then went to the refreshment counter and I spent a further $11 for this
*26:29.160- 26:37.140* :  tub of popcorn and another $8 for this soft drink. Now, that comes to $37 and that is a lot of
*26:37.140- 26:42.420* :  money just for one person. Imagine what it's like if you're going with a group of friends or with a
*26:42.420- 26:48.240* :  family. Out on the streets of New York, the general view is that the place of movie refreshments
*26:48.240- 26:55.140* :  is much too high. Whether it's tickets or concessions is way too high at larger chains. I feel like
*26:55.140- 27:00.840* :  the prices jacked up quite a bit. If the refreshments and the tickets as well were more affordable,
*27:00.840- 27:06.240* :  I feel like that could definitely attract more people. It's tough for those who work on the front
*27:06.240- 27:11.820* :  lines. Anthony Squatery is a serverer's a dining cinema because of my refreshment prices,
*27:11.820- 27:17.540* :  his server colleagues are the target of customer frustration. If they think there's something wrong
*27:17.540- 27:21.140* :  with their bill like they think they've been overcharged for something they get very aggressive
*27:21.140- 27:26.260* :  because they've all even if the bill is correct they're already spending so much money.
*27:30.620- 27:35.420* :  Popcorn and cinemas used to be much more affordable but now its prices become a global
*27:35.420- 27:40.160* :  lament. In India there being complaints of a skyrocketing cost while cinemas in
*27:40.160- 27:45.600* :  israel are being investigated for allegedly operating a price fixing cartel in relation to
*27:45.600- 27:51.740* :  refreshments and ticket prices. Some economists see cinemas chains operating a restrictive monopolistic
*27:51.740- 27:57.800* :  practice with high refreshment prices. When you go to the cinema you don't really have a lot of options.
*27:59.160- 28:04.520* :  You're discouraged from bringing your own food in so it is an economic term, a monopoly.
*28:05.440- 28:12.760* :  So if you want your chocolate, your popcorn, your soda, you're going to end up having to pay
*28:12.760- 28:17.760* :  whatever price they charge. So since they have you over that metaphorical barrel there's really
*28:17.760- 28:24.560* :  no reason why prices should come down. One big underlying factor driving up the cost of refreshments
*28:24.560- 28:31.000* :  is that box office takings are still down below pre-COVID levels so cinemas can maintain viability
*28:31.000- 28:36.680* :  are leaning more heavily on refreshment sales than ticket revenues as their operating cost rise.
*28:37.420- 28:41.960* :  Some small cinemas like New York's long established art house cinemas village are trying to
*28:41.960- 28:47.860* :  cater to moviegoers frustrated by high refreshment prices. They take pride in offering not just
*28:47.860- 28:53.780* :  original curated programming but good quality popcorn which costs far less than that found in cinema
*28:53.780- 29:01.460* :  chains. We've cultivated several regular customers who don't even see movies they come in and they
*29:01.460- 29:08.440* :  buy our popcorn every day every other day. So I'm quite proud of that. But with the big cinema chains
*29:08.440- 29:14.060* :  the inflated cost of refreshments is really a reflection of underlying changes in the film business.
*29:14.060- 29:20.260* :  COVID and streaming services have depressed movie going and until people return in greater numbers
*29:20.780- 29:24.880* :  upward pressure on the price of cinema refreshments is just going to continue.
*29:25.600- 29:32.380* :  Tom Brook at least 500 people are reported to be killed each year in attacks from hippos
*29:32.820- 29:38.120* :  but one British tourist in Zambia had a lucky escape after the canoe he and his wife were paddling
*29:38.120- 29:44.040* :  in was overturned by one of the creatures. Here's 63 year old Roland Sherry recounting that moment.
*29:44.060- 29:52.400* :  There was a almighty crash much like a car crash really and our canoe leapt up in the air so back first
*29:52.400- 29:57.200* :  and we were turfed out into the water and we come in new immediately what had happened
*29:57.200- 30:02.280* :  but in the kind of the impact the side of the canoe smashed into my right shoulder
*30:02.860- 30:06.240* :  and was and the shoulder was dislocated as we were turfed into the water.
*30:06.920- 30:13.460* :  So we both arrived in the water at Shirley full of the instruction which is swim like crazy for
*30:13.460- 30:20.680* :  the bank and I was unable to to swim because I only had one arm really so I was trying to say
*30:20.680- 30:26.300* :  do my best for the one arm doggy pedal and then I felt this thing come from underneath me and
*30:26.700- 30:33.740* :  and I kind of knew in my heart saying what what was happening and then I was dragged underwater by
*30:33.740- 30:39.700* :  the hippo in its jaws and taken down to the bottom of the river and I remember thinking quite
*30:39.700- 30:44.400* :  vividly that this really isn't the way I wanted to go you know there were still many things I
*30:44.400- 30:50.500* :  wanted to do in life and being so killed by a hippo in a river was was not high on that agenda
*30:51.000- 30:55.800* :  and he took me down to the bottom of the river and then it let me go and I will I was relieved to get
*30:55.800- 30:59.340* :  to the surface I've seen took a huge goal per there but I'm afraid that wasn't the end of it
*30:59.540- 31:06.400* :  the hippo came and grabbed me in its jaws read out to the water and then threw me like a ragdoll
*31:07.240- 31:11.900* :  we were there to see the natural world and we wanted to see it but I want to see that close up
*31:12.960- 31:17.860* :  Roland Cherry well it turned out the hippo was a mother who appeared to be protecting her young
*31:17.860- 31:23.920* :  as for Roland he suffered life threatening leg and abdominal injuries but was saved by doctors
*31:23.920- 31:29.860* :  at the local hospital and happy ending he's now raising money to buy the hospital an ambulance
*31:31.740- 31:35.120* :  and that's it from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the global news podcast later
