*01:57.360- 02:01.740* :  Today, the not-so-secret battle to control a personal media empire.
*02:02.600- 02:04.480* :  Rupert Murdoch, the mogul who controls
*02:04.480- 02:07.060* :  some of the world's most influential news organizations,
*02:07.060- 02:10.240* :  is this week pitted against three of his children
*02:10.240- 02:14.120* :  in a bitter legal contest taking place behind closed doors.
*02:15.040- 02:19.600* :  After dramatically stepping down as chairman of Fox and newscorp last year,
*02:20.060- 02:23.260* :  the Macquarie or Mr Murdoch hope to pave the way for his so-called
*02:23.260- 02:26.500* :  favourite son to become the sole heir to his throne.
*02:27.200- 02:30.580* :  But his efforts to amend a family trust and tended to share out
*02:30.580- 02:34.340* :  the billionaire's voting rights are being challenged by Lachlan's siblings.
*02:35.340- 02:36.920* :  We're asking why all this matters?
*02:37.500- 02:40.500* :  And should the public have the right to hear about what's going on?
*02:46.940- 02:51.040* :  With me today is the BBC's Culture and Media Editor, Katie Razzle,
*02:51.120- 02:56.760* :  and also Brian Stelter, CNN's Chief Media Analyst and author of Network of Lies,
*02:56.760- 03:02.220* :  the epic saga of Fox News, Donald Trump, and the battle for American democracy.
*03:02.720- 03:02.920* :  Hello.
*03:03.180- 03:03.720* :  Great to be here.
*03:03.940- 03:05.140* :  Good to have you both with us.
*03:05.140- 03:07.620* :  I have to start with a bit of a confession.
*03:08.180- 03:12.900* :  I actually haven't watched succession, but that doesn't mean I haven't been fascinated
*03:12.900- 03:15.220* :  by the Murdoch family dramas for years.
*03:15.780- 03:17.920* :  And I wanted to ask both of you, why did it work?
*03:18.080- 03:23.640* :  Did it work so well and was so popular because it was actually linked to real life people
*03:23.640- 03:24.180* :  and events?
*03:24.260- 03:29.400* :  It had enough juicy content that could possibly have been real that people were fascinated
*03:29.400- 03:29.680* :  by.
*03:30.180- 03:33.980* :  I was going to say that Jesse Armstrong, the writer, has kept us guessing because everybody
*03:33.980- 03:38.560* :  assumed, as soon as the show started, that this was really about the Murdoch's.
*03:38.960- 03:43.400* :  And particularly, you know, there's the three main kids and we knew that he has the
*03:43.400- 03:47.540* :  three main media executive kids, obviously there are the children, but those three children
*03:47.560- 03:50.220* :  in that felt like they depicted the Murdoch children.
*03:50.320- 03:54.380* :  And actually, he kept sort of teasing us, Jesse Armstrong, about whether it was related
*03:54.380- 03:54.900* :  to the Murdoch's.
*03:54.980- 03:58.860* :  But I think he put that to bed in a way that satisfied us all actually because he was
*03:58.860- 04:03.260* :  at the Edinburgh TV festival and he did say that he originally wrote a script about
*04:03.260- 04:04.500* :  Rupert Murdoch and his family.
*04:05.000- 04:07.840* :  He morphed and based it on other people as well, but I think we all, I don't know what
*04:07.840- 04:10.800* :  you think, but I think we all spotted a lot of similarities.
*04:11.720- 04:11.940* :  Right.
*04:11.940- 04:17.760* :  There are other dysfunctional media mogul families, several of them actually, but succession
*04:17.760- 04:20.860* :  was clearly inspired by the Murdoch's.
*04:20.900- 04:25.860* :  And now we're at the point where life is imitating art because storylines from the show are actually
*04:25.860- 04:27.580* :  playing out in real life in Nevada.
*04:27.900- 04:33.800* :  So Katie, tell us a little bit about this man, this material, influential media mogul,
*04:33.800- 04:37.880* :  Rupert Murdoch, who created this massive media empire.
*04:37.880- 04:40.320* :  Tell us about him and what that empire looks like today.
*04:40.640- 04:45.220* :  Well, yes, because I mean, he is characterised by many as the most powerful and recognisable
*04:45.220- 04:51.520* :  media mogul in the world, certainly a shrewd and ruthless businessman, somebody that politicians
*04:51.660- 04:57.180* :  have had to pay homage to for many decades with an empire that spans three continents.
*04:58.040- 05:03.480* :  He's Australian, educated at Oxford University and began by inheriting a newspaper from
*05:03.480- 05:08.040* :  his father in Australia in Adelaide and quickly clearly showed a sort of natural flair for
*05:08.040- 05:08.440* :  journalism.
*05:08.500- 05:14.880* :  And also, I think an understanding of popular taste and expanded that empire into the UK,
*05:14.880- 05:15.940* :  into the US.
*05:16.260- 05:20.560* :  Mr Murdoch, we've called this programme, who is afraid of Rupert Murdoch and it seems that
*05:21.320- 05:26.140* :  many people are afraid, principally because they can't believe that you won't interfere
*05:26.140- 05:30.040* :  and alter the character of the newspapers you've bought the Sunday Times and the Times.
*05:30.040- 05:30.980* :  What do you say to that?
*05:31.560- 05:35.520* :  Well, I certainly didn't buy them to change them and the Times, of course, it'll depend
*05:35.520- 05:36.680* :  on the new editor, what happens?
*05:37.360- 05:41.320* :  Well, somebody like yourself, as was said in the film with a powerful personality and
*05:41.320- 05:46.540* :  liking intervention, it will be very difficult, won't it, for you not to get involved directly
*05:46.820- 05:49.580* :  in the stories that are in the paper and the way it's written, the headlines and all
*05:49.580- 05:52.340* :  the details that actually make up what a newspaper is.
*05:52.780- 05:53.480* :  Oh, extremely difficult.
*05:53.480- 05:57.460* :  But if I see things in the paper which I think are incorrect, I'll certainly point it out
*05:57.460- 06:01.140* :  and say, so I'm saying, made a mistake here, oh, this wasn't as good a reporter was in
*06:01.140- 06:02.200* :  the opposition newspapers.
*06:03.000- 06:05.820* :  I certainly have the right to insist on excellence.
*06:06.480- 06:10.880* :  And these days, he is no longer, he's stepped back, he's now called Chairman Emeritus.
*06:11.900- 06:18.280* :  What he owns is two major entities, news core and Fox core and news core is a whole load
*06:18.280- 06:23.720* :  of papers mainly, including the Wall Street Journal in the US, the New York Post, the Times
*06:23.720- 06:28.720* :  and Sunday Times in the UK, as well as the Sun, it's also Harper Collins, that one of
*06:28.720- 06:33.540* :  the big book publishers, globally and then Fox Corporation, you know, the most famous
*06:33.920- 06:38.860* :  part of that is Fox News, which is one of the most watched news networks, cable news networks
*06:38.860- 06:39.440* :  in the US.
*06:39.860- 06:43.800* :  So Katie, this week, we're all watching what's happening at a court in Nevada.
*06:43.800- 06:45.560* :  Can you outline what the case is about?
*06:46.160- 06:49.340* :  Well, we're all watching what's happening without actually knowing to be fair, because
*06:49.340- 06:50.540* :  it's all completely secret.
*06:50.720- 06:56.600* :  But this is about a trust that was set up after Rupert Murdoch's divorce from his second
*06:56.600- 07:02.100* :  wife Anna, who is the mother of three of the children, James, Loughlin and Elizabeth.
*07:02.500- 07:06.060* :  And that was a trust that was set up and was supposed to be irrevocable.
*07:06.060- 07:10.560* :  So Anna, I'm told, could have taken half of everything, but she wanted to ensure the
*07:10.560- 07:14.340* :  future legacy of her three children and her stepdaughter prudence.
*07:14.700- 07:19.900* :  And what this trust does, it says that after Rupert Murdoch dies, they have equal voting
*07:19.940- 07:22.040* :  rates over what happens to the business.
*07:22.120- 07:27.640* :  He has two other daughters, daughters with Wendy Deng, his third wife, but they were
*07:27.640- 07:30.960* :  actually only added to this trust as financial beneficiaries.
*07:32.000- 07:36.220* :  So what we know is that Rupert Murdoch wants to change the terms of the trust, to give
*07:36.220- 07:39.560* :  his elder son, Loughlin, full power after his death.
*07:39.560- 07:43.680* :  And he's arguing that that is in the interest, the financial interests and the wider interests
*07:43.720- 07:45.380* :  of all the children.
*07:45.380- 07:50.420* :  But that's not how it went down with the other three children who are fighting back.
*07:50.420- 07:56.200* :  And it's what's happening in this secret court is that a Nevada probate judge essentially
*07:56.200- 08:02.580* :  has to decide, is the change that he wants to make in the interest of all equally and
*08:02.580- 08:03.460* :  made in good faith.
*08:03.860- 08:08.480* :  And Brian, like all families, we are fascinated by the relationships within the family and
*08:08.480- 08:09.840* :  the dynamics within the family.
*08:10.500- 08:13.740* :  So who is this favorite son, Loughlin, and what are his politics?
*08:14.340- 08:17.020* :  In some ways, Loughlin is even more conservative than his dad.
*08:17.540- 08:19.520* :  But Loughlin is not as public about this.
*08:20.000- 08:21.680* :  He doesn't talk about politics often.
*08:22.580- 08:26.060* :  He doesn't hobnob with Donald Trump the way Rupert used to.
*08:26.060- 08:29.880* :  He's a more private person, but he is known to be more conservative.
*08:30.300- 08:31.300* :  He has those values.
*08:31.300- 08:33.380* :  He has expressed them occasionally in speeches.
*08:33.820- 08:38.100* :  But damage done to the Americans, like, through unrelenting attacks on its core values
*08:38.460- 08:39.820* :  and via the destructive rewriting of history.
*08:40.280- 08:41.020* :  He's very real.
*08:41.640- 08:46.320* :  In 2019, the New York Times published the first of a series of essays called the 1619
*08:46.320- 08:50.560* :  project, which recast America's accept housing as ratif from inception.
*08:51.440- 08:56.540* :  A project to recast America's history and long accepted values through a radical and
*08:56.540- 08:58.080* :  radically divisive lens.
*08:58.100- 09:01.100* :  And most importantly, it expresses them through Fox News.
*09:01.460- 09:05.880* :  For listeners who are not familiar, who don't watch Fox News on a regular basis, Fox
*09:05.880- 09:08.680* :  is the dominant right-wing player in the United States.
*09:09.240- 09:13.280* :  It is like the McDonald's or the Coca-Cola, you know, of right-wing media.
*09:13.740- 09:19.420* :  Fox has so much to do with Donald Trump's election, and then, frankly, has lost in 2020,
*09:19.420- 09:23.020* :  but then has reemergence in 2024 as a Republican nominee.
*09:23.620- 09:27.420* :  Laughlin Murdoch, for better or for worse, is responsible for a lot of that.
*09:27.420- 09:32.420* :  So when we looked at Laughlin Murdoch, the older son, the chosen son, he is the one who
*09:32.420- 09:36.860* :  is the representative now of Fox and of Fox News, as his father has stepped off to the
*09:36.860- 09:37.160* :  side.
*09:37.700- 09:40.540* :  Rupert was once close with his other son, James.
*09:40.540- 09:41.760* :  What went wrong there?
*09:42.220- 09:46.920* :  I feel like as we look into this famous and dysfunctional, now-worrying family, there's
*09:46.920- 09:48.960* :  only so much we can really tell from the outside.
*09:49.480- 09:50.340* :  What was the breaking point?
*09:50.340- 09:51.180* :  What went wrong?
*09:51.620- 09:55.960* :  But we do know that for a long time, Rupert was trying to involve James in the family
*09:55.960- 09:58.280* :  business, giving him high-ranking positions.
*09:58.300- 10:02.840* :  And in recent years, James has been viewed as the more moderate or even liberal son,
*10:03.260- 10:07.540* :  working with his wife, Catherine, to donate to climate change organizations, supporting
*10:07.540- 10:10.700* :  President Biden and now endorsing Kamala Harris for president.
*10:11.080- 10:14.240* :  That's a dramatic break from Rupert and Laughlin.
*10:14.640- 10:17.500* :  Again, these guys don't say it in public very often, if ever.
*10:17.940- 10:23.280* :  But James has told his friends and associates that he believes Fox News is dramatically
*10:23.280- 10:27.680* :  hurting the United States, is poisoning the public discourse, is misinforming millions
*10:27.680- 10:28.200* :  of people.
*10:28.660- 10:30.480* :  And James even has a plan to fix it.
*10:30.480- 10:33.180* :  James would like to drag Fox more to the middle.
*10:34.080- 10:39.820* :  But he can only do that if he's able to convince his sisters to overthrow his brother, Laughlin.
*10:40.120- 10:42.820* :  And that's where this gets really interesting and really weird.
*10:43.060- 10:45.220* :  And that's where it starts to sound very like succession.
*10:46.620- 10:49.020* :  So there's this fight Katie over the future of Fox News.
*10:49.140- 10:53.020* :  But there was also that very damaging legal battle that Fox went through with Dominion.
*10:53.240- 10:54.420* :  How does that influence things?
*10:54.640- 10:55.300* :  Yes, there was.
*10:55.300- 11:02.660* :  So back in the 2020 election, Fox, broadcast claims of election fraud.
*11:03.340- 11:08.460* :  And essentially what happened was that they were forced to settle a defamation lawsuit
*11:08.460- 11:14.440* :  brought by Dominion voting systems, which was one of the companies that had voting machines
*11:14.460- 11:16.180* :  that we used during the election.
*11:16.260- 11:22.700* :  And basically Fox anchors had defamed that company by endorsing false allegations of election
*11:22.700- 11:28.580* :  fraud in 2020, including claims that the voting machines were rigged against Donald Trump.
*11:28.800- 11:29.200* :  Good evening.
*11:29.580- 11:30.420* :  Welcome to Tucker Carlson.
*11:30.420- 11:31.660* :  Tonight, thank you for watching.
*11:31.660- 11:32.640* :  We appreciate it.
*11:32.640- 11:35.720* :  In case you haven't noticed, it's hard to trust anything you hear right now.
*11:36.000- 11:39.880* :  We want to begin tonight by assessing some of the things no doubt you have heard about
*11:39.880- 11:41.280* :  last week's presidential election.
*11:41.280- 11:44.760* :  They're conflicting versions of virtually every part of that story.
*11:45.300- 11:47.280* :  But as of right now, here's what we think we know.
*11:47.580- 11:51.500* :  What it's meant is that I mean, it's an absolutely huge payout.
*11:51.500- 11:56.380* :  They settled for, we understand it's $787.5 million.
*11:57.340- 12:02.480* :  Today's settlement represents vindication and accountability.
*12:03.460- 12:05.380* :  Lies have consequences.
*12:06.460- 12:10.280* :  In the aftermath of that, they also had to buy the most popular conservative host, Tucker
*12:10.280- 12:14.440* :  Carlson from Fox, because of his incendiary comments.
*12:15.200- 12:19.700* :  James Murdock looked at that from the outside and says this is exactly why there needs to
*12:19.700- 12:20.500* :  be regime change.
*12:20.500- 12:25.880* :  But what's striking about the Nevada situation now is the three siblings are up against the
*12:25.880- 12:27.080* :  other sibling and the father.
*12:27.240- 12:31.860* :  So right now, it is three against one, but because of Murdock, 93 years old is alive
*12:31.860- 12:32.380* :  and well.
*12:32.460- 12:35.520* :  He is the one trying to rewrite his own trust.
*12:36.180- 12:43.260* :  In other words, Rupert is trying to ensure that his other children and not change Fox's
*12:43.260- 12:44.360* :  political identity.
*12:45.100- 12:51.440* :  And it's interesting because I've had some pushback on the idea that the three other children,
*12:51.440- 12:57.000* :  the three older children will vote to oust and the older son, but actually,
*12:57.460- 12:58.260* :  clearly, it's obvious.
*12:58.260- 13:01.660* :  Rupert Murdock thinks they will because otherwise he wouldn't be trying to change the terms
*13:01.660- 13:02.280* :  of this trust.
*13:02.840- 13:03.960* :  What are you hearing on that, Brian?
*13:04.200- 13:09.520* :  I've had sources close to James say he knows this is very sensitive, it's very complicated.
*13:09.520- 13:11.420* :  He would have to have the support of his sisters.
*13:11.420- 13:13.040* :  He would have to persuade them.
*13:13.540- 13:17.900* :  And according to these sources, James is playing a long game and that's what's so awkward
*13:17.900- 13:18.340* :  about this.
*13:18.680- 13:20.540* :  It's all incumbent on his father dying.
*13:21.560- 13:25.860* :  We don't know if Rupert Murdock will be with us for another year or another decade or
*13:25.860- 13:30.740* :  another two decades, but in the event of his death, because it comes for us all eventually,
*13:31.260- 13:34.140* :  there will be this struggle for control of the family businesses.
*13:34.140- 13:39.380* :  There will be this battle, whether James prevails or not is an unknown, but the fact that
*13:39.380- 13:43.340* :  his father's trying to cut it off now and ensure this can't happen, you know, that's
*13:43.340- 13:47.400* :  a plot twist that no one saw coming 25 years ago when this trust was created.
*13:48.300- 13:49.920* :  And Rupert is recently remarried again.
*13:49.940- 13:52.100* :  This could give him a whole new lease on life.
*13:52.440- 13:55.280* :  And at the wedding, these other kids weren't there.
*13:55.620- 13:57.380* :  So on a personal level, this is heartbreaking.
*13:57.840- 14:02.340* :  I mean, you've got to think about that moment when your dad comes to tell you that he wants
*14:02.340- 14:03.960* :  to change the terms of a trust.
*14:04.440- 14:08.660* :  And he's trying to tell you, as I understand it, that this is a good thing that he's doing
*14:08.660- 14:09.920* :  this in your interests.
*14:10.840- 14:15.980* :  And you're sitting there as Elizabeth or Prudence or James, thinking, doesn't feel like
*14:15.980- 14:16.800* :  this to me, dad.
*14:16.800- 14:21.120* :  I mean, whatever, however many millions and billions you have in the end, you want your
*14:21.120- 14:24.660* :  dad to love you and treat you equally, and I guess they think he's not.
*14:26.980- 14:28.880* :  So we know what this case is all about.
*14:29.260- 14:31.940* :  Coming up, we'll ask what it means for the wider media landscape.
*14:40.660- 14:44.460* :  Hi folks, this is Mark Bitman from Food With Mark Bitman, and I'm going to share some
*14:44.460- 14:47.620* :  money-saving tips when it comes to shopping at Whole Foods Market.

*16:11.360- 16:15.420* :  We bring you one big international story in detail five days a week.
*16:15.760- 16:17.500* :  Follow or subscribe where the listen.
*16:18.140- 16:23.620* :  With me are the BBC's culture and media editor Katie Razzle and CNN's chief media analyst
*16:23.700- 16:24.520* :  Brian Stelter.
*16:25.120- 16:28.180* :  Katie, you told us about the size of the Murdoch empire and its vastness.
*16:28.760- 16:34.480* :  But can you give us a sense of how closely involved he is with all of his titles editorially?
*16:35.040- 16:38.340* :  Well, it may be different now because obviously he did make this announcement that he was stepping
*16:38.340- 16:38.720* :  back.
*16:39.460- 16:45.540* :  92-year-old medium-adney, Robert Murdoch, announcing he'll leave his role as chair of Fox and
*16:45.540- 16:49.860* :  News Corp in mid-November, becoming chair emeritus of both businesses.
*16:50.420- 16:52.300* :  His son, Locklin, will take the reins.
*16:52.500- 16:54.800* :  Part of a long-standing succession plan.
*16:55.260- 17:01.000* :  But more broadly, every time in my experience, certainly here in the UK, an editor is asked
*17:01.000- 17:06.120* :  publicly how involved Rupert Murdoch has been in their newspaper title.
*17:06.300- 17:10.960* :  They say, no, not really involved at all, we have full editorial freedom, he's a wonderful
*17:10.960- 17:14.120* :  proprietor and we can do what we like.
*17:14.140- 17:19.540* :  But behind the scenes in my experience, people do say different, they've been very hands-on
*17:19.880- 17:20.800* :  through his career.
*17:21.120- 17:25.820* :  We've got to leave that obviously, and this is some tremendous news, but I think the
*17:25.820- 17:32.260* :  line in it to answer this controversy is to say, forgive the individuals by all means
*17:32.460- 17:33.340* :  but you can't forget.
*17:34.080- 17:37.240* :  Well, of course, we should take the offensive in other words about this, and they're not
*17:37.240- 17:37.760* :  reversing.
*17:37.940- 17:39.800* :  If it keeps it boiling for six weeks, so much better.
*17:40.140- 17:46.900* :  Just ahead of the UK election in July, I did a story about how the son, one of his titles,
*17:46.900- 17:52.760* :  the son newspaper, was going to switch course and endorse Labour for the first time in
*17:52.760- 17:56.440* :  a very long while, because it's traditionally been a conservative backing newspaper and
*17:56.440- 18:02.240* :  then here in the UK, very famously, in 1997 when Tony Blair became prime minister ahead
*18:02.240- 18:04.580* :  of that, the son switched courses.
*18:04.980- 18:11.160* :  I spoke to the son editor from back in 1997, who told a fabulous and interesting story
*18:11.160- 18:15.440* :  about how that change came about, and just that it comes from the top.
*18:15.440- 18:19.380* :  Rupert Murdoch made this decision, he told them that's what he wanted.
*18:19.860- 18:24.940* :  He'd obviously been being rude and had been wooing Tony Blair for a very long time at that
*18:24.980- 18:25.260* :  point.
*18:25.620- 18:30.240* :  But this son editor, he said, we pushed back, we were conserved as we were a conservative
*18:30.240- 18:33.240* :  paper, we didn't want it, but in the end, you do what Rupert Murdoch wants.
*18:33.700- 18:36.800* :  And there have been several scandals under his leadership.
*18:37.260- 18:40.900* :  I think the most notable that people will remember Katie as their long-running phone
*18:40.900- 18:42.400* :  hacking scandal at News of the World.
*18:43.280- 18:48.960* :  This involved allegations that were then proven that News International Journalists were hacking
*18:48.960- 18:50.820* :  people's phones for information.
*18:51.340- 18:55.960* :  Now phone hacking for people who don't know was a technique, essentially that you listen
*18:55.960- 18:58.240* :  to people's mobile voicemails.
*18:58.780- 19:04.040* :  And reporters and a private investigator working for the News of the World, which was the Sunday
*19:04.340- 19:09.960* :  sister title to the sun, used it to target people in the news so that was celebrities, politicians.
*19:10.760- 19:17.560* :  And then this absolutely horrific bombshell emerged once it became clear that the News
*19:17.560- 19:22.680* :  of the World had listened to the voicemails of a schoolgirl who'd been murdered called
*19:22.680- 19:23.420* :  Millie Dowler.
*19:24.380- 19:28.840* :  In the days after she went missing, sorry police kept her payers you go phone, topped
*19:28.840- 19:31.280* :  up with credit, in case she switched it on.
*19:31.880- 19:36.880* :  This evening, the Guardian says it has a well-played source who alleges an investigator paid
*19:36.880- 19:40.800* :  by the News of the World accessed phone messages on Millie's mobile.
*19:41.160- 19:46.260* :  The awful thing, even more shocking than that, was that her parents were given hope that
*19:46.260- 19:50.520* :  she was still alive because it sounded as if that from the phone that their daughter had
*19:50.520- 19:53.760* :  been listening to her own voicemail, so they were given hope that she was alive and
*19:53.760- 19:54.560* :  of course she wasn't.
*19:54.560- 19:56.220* :  It was journalists listening.
*19:56.220- 20:00.700* :  And this caused a huge feroare, quite rightly, here in the UK.
*20:01.380- 20:05.100* :  And Rupert Murdoch took the decision to close the News of the World.
*20:05.580- 20:10.300* :  They admitted that huge scale of hacking that had been going on dating back many years.
*20:10.300- 20:16.620* :  It was really a huge humiliation for Rupert Murdoch personally, came also at huge financial
*20:16.640- 20:17.100* :  cost.
*20:18.340- 20:24.140* :  Actually, isn't really over because NewsCore says this only happened on one newspaper
*20:24.200- 20:28.200* :  at the News of the World, but there have been people battling, saying of course that's
*20:28.200- 20:33.100* :  not true that it happened at the Sun as well, but NewsCore has never, ever accepted that,
*20:33.100- 20:36.980* :  has pushed back on that, and every time there's been some high-profile people like
*20:36.980- 20:41.780* :  Sienna Miller and indeed Hugh Grant, who've tried to take them to call over phone hacking
*20:41.780- 20:44.700* :  when it comes to the Sun, and that's never seen the light of day.
*20:45.600- 20:50.400* :  So despite the scandals that we've been talking about, the Dominion case here in the US,
*20:50.400- 20:56.120* :  and Katie, you referencing the phone hacking with News of the World, it's amazing, isn't it Brian?
*20:56.400- 21:01.880* :  How incredibly widely Rupert Murdoch is because his empire has actually changed a lot over
*21:01.880- 21:02.700* :  the past decade.
*21:02.700- 21:06.200* :  He's navigated things from a business sense in a very clever way.
*21:06.780- 21:09.580* :  And did it start perhaps when Fox and NewsCore split?
*21:10.040- 21:10.960* :  Yes, it did.
*21:11.300- 21:16.620* :  And then when Rupert Murdoch hatched a deal with Bob Eiger to sell most of Fox's entertainment
*21:16.620- 21:21.740* :  assets to Disney, say what you will about Rupert Murdoch, but his timing was exquisite.
*21:22.100- 21:26.840* :  He was able to sell off the cable channels that it sends to client in value, and he was
*21:26.840- 21:31.820* :  able to provide this huge amount of programming that has supercharged the Disney Plus streaming
*21:31.820- 21:32.160* :  service.
*21:32.740- 21:38.740* :  So he was able to cash out at a key time, and he was able to give about $2 billion to each
*21:38.740- 21:39.400* :  of his children.
*21:39.920- 21:44.580* :  Rupert is now part of the battle in Nevada about how that money was split up, and how
*21:44.580- 21:48.120* :  Rupert has been a great caretaker, he's been a responsible patriarch.
*21:48.120- 21:52.860* :  Rupert was able to time the market well, but the result was that his company is now,
*21:52.980- 21:54.380* :  you know, a shell of its former self.
*21:54.380- 21:59.320* :  It's mostly a news and sports company, but those news assets are still very influential,
*21:59.320- 22:03.820* :  you know, not just Fox News, but also the Wall Street Journal, as well as his papers
*22:04.340- 22:05.780* :  in the UK and in Australia.
*22:06.380- 22:11.740* :  You'll notice that in these countries where there are center-right or even far-right movements,
*22:12.340- 22:16.720* :  it is the Murdoch media empire that is helping to lead that charge.
*22:17.240- 22:22.840* :  That's really a common thread that we see in the countries, in the parts of the world
*22:22.840- 22:23.980* :  where Murdoch is operating.
*22:24.380- 22:28.700* :  What are your thoughts on that, Katie, because we are seeing the declining reach of newspapers
*22:28.700- 22:34.340* :  and cable TV, but being here in DC at the moment, you really do feel the power of networks
*22:34.340- 22:34.940* :  like Fox.
*22:35.720- 22:37.920* :  I wonder whether Fox is a very specific case.
*22:37.920- 22:43.400* :  I mean, we endlessly talk about the decline of what's called the legacy media.
*22:43.680- 22:48.620* :  And by that, we really do mean newspapers and the kind of public service broadcasters,
*22:48.620- 22:54.120* :  like, you know, here at the BBC, social media, these big companies, like Google,
*22:54.180- 23:00.060* :  have just taken away the business in a way that feels insurmountable.
*23:00.560- 23:04.880* :  If you think, for example, about the Sun, one of the most influential newspapers,
*23:05.520- 23:10.560* :  back in 1997, the time I was talking about, four million people read that newspaper every day.
*23:11.160- 23:16.560* :  Now, I mean, they don't even print their daily readership, but it's believed to be around 600,000.
*23:16.620- 23:18.320* :  And that's not bad for a newspaper.
*23:18.320- 23:20.480* :  I mean, the decline has been spectacular.
*23:21.340- 23:29.000* :  And that does mean you start to question quite the influence that these newspapers have these days.
*23:29.580- 23:31.680* :  These newspapers are also pivoting to digital.
*23:31.680- 23:33.300* :  Some more successfully than others.
*23:33.300- 23:37.820* :  The Sun would, you know, point to the fact they say they reach nearly seven million people every day
*23:38.280- 23:39.760* :  through a combination of digital and print.
*23:40.160- 23:42.160* :  But I think Fox is a separate case.
*23:42.160- 23:43.120* :  I don't know what you think, Brian.
*23:43.820- 23:47.040* :  Yeah, I do think it's a separate case because Fox programming is addictive.
*23:47.740- 23:52.440* :  It is pressing all the buttons every day, buttons about fear and rage and anger and resentment.
*23:52.440- 23:56.280* :  When the Biden-Harris administration rolled out the red carpet for millions of migrants,
*23:56.380- 23:58.780* :  they didn't just ship them to Texas and New York.
*23:59.140- 24:02.300* :  Thousands were deposited into small towns across the country,
*24:02.300- 24:07.220* :  like Springfield, Ohio, violent crime, skyrocket, 142%.
*24:07.400- 24:10.900* :  Car accidents spiked, trash started piling up in the streets.
*24:10.900- 24:14.240* :  There is even rumors that people's pets have gone missing.
*24:14.600- 24:18.560* :  And in so doing, Fox, much like Donald Trump does with his base,
*24:19.140- 24:22.740* :  it really creates a powerful connection to the audience.
*24:23.380- 24:28.640* :  That is something that is going to continue even as cable declines in the US.
*24:29.260- 24:32.260* :  When Laughlin Murdoch fire Tucker Carlson, there was a ratings collapse.
*24:32.900- 24:35.380* :  But the ratings did eventually bounce back.
*24:35.500- 24:37.000* :  And it proved, once and for all,
*24:37.000- 24:40.120* :  that Fox is bigger than any single individual.
*24:40.700- 24:42.320* :  Now, that raises interesting question.
*24:42.320- 24:45.120* :  Is Fox also bigger than any single executive?
*24:45.880- 24:50.200* :  Thanks to the Dominion case, we know that Rupert Murdoch was criticizing Trump in private,
*24:50.200- 24:52.200* :  saying, we're going to turn him into a non-person.
*24:52.240- 24:53.720* :  We're going to pivot away from Trump.
*24:53.720- 24:57.900* :  This is how Rupert Murdoch was talking in the immediate aftermath of the insurrection.
*24:58.700- 25:02.720* :  And yet, because shows mainstream conspiracy, there is a much aneurysix,
*25:03.140- 25:07.500* :  because guests on Fox suggested maybe it was the government's fault and not the rioters fault,
*25:07.500- 25:11.940* :  because the ground was softened for Trump to have a resurrection.
*25:12.520- 25:13.980* :  But largely thanks to Fox.
*25:14.680- 25:18.480* :  Trump is now back center stage, and Rupert Murdoch seems to be accepting it.
*25:18.840- 25:20.760* :  And I wouldn't count the papers out either.
*25:20.760- 25:23.940* :  The New York Post, for example, that does a lot of great reporting.
*25:24.020- 25:28.280* :  It also had a tendency to promote misinformation from time to time.
*25:28.280- 25:32.500* :  I remember there was a story last year claiming that veterans were being picked out of hotels
*25:32.500- 25:33.880* :  to make room for migrants.
*25:34.500- 25:38.160* :  And of course, that's the kind of story that Fox jumped on, and then it was highlighting
*25:38.160- 25:38.700* :  for days.
*25:39.340- 25:43.860* :  So that pipeline of misinformation, where something can make you really mad about immigration,
*25:44.020- 25:49.440* :  it can spread from Rupert's newspaper to Rupert's network, that's a pipeline that remains
*25:49.440- 25:53.940* :  really powerful, even though some of these individual properties might be shrinking in size.
*25:54.320- 25:56.260* :  Katie, back to the case in Nevada.
*25:56.980- 25:59.340* :  How much do you think we're actually going to learn about it?
*25:59.340- 26:01.720* :  And even if there was a settlement, how much we would learn?
*26:01.720- 26:04.060* :  Are there petitions to unseal the proceedings?
*26:04.640- 26:05.580* :  Well, yes, there have been.
*26:05.620- 26:11.520* :  And those include six national news outlets who in a coalition that includes associated press,
*26:11.540- 26:14.620* :  CNN, various others, Reuters, Washington Post.
*26:14.620- 26:19.160* :  They have filed requests to access proceedings and unseal court records.
*26:19.160- 26:23.900* :  And they're arguing of course that what happens to the empire is in the public interest.
*26:24.420- 26:28.160* :  I read that and I thought, well, good luck, but we know it hasn't happened,
*26:28.160- 26:30.400* :  because I don't think they're sitting in court right now.
*26:30.960- 26:36.040* :  So I guess the question is, will we ever find out or do we have to wait till when he dies?
*26:36.720- 26:40.600* :  I feel like we will, based on the fact that somebody, and I have no idea who,
*26:40.600- 26:43.660* :  but somebody leaked the original staff to the New York Times.
*26:44.460- 26:48.540* :  I hope and I think that there will be some leak that tells us what the judge rules.
*26:48.540- 26:52.440* :  But I don't know when that'll happen, because to your point about the New York Times,
*26:52.500- 26:57.320* :  Rupert started to make these moves almost a year ago, and it didn't leak for more than six months.
*26:58.120- 27:02.940* :  Recently though, there was a leak to the Wall Street Journal that did seem to come from the other side, right?
*27:02.940- 27:04.840* :  So Lachlan and Rupert do own some newspapers.
*27:04.860- 27:07.580* :  They do have an ability to get the news out.
*27:08.220- 27:11.400* :  So I hope the one way or another, we will find out what happens.
*27:11.980- 27:16.040* :  The personal drama of the case and the family, Brian, is so compelling.
*27:16.440- 27:19.260* :  It's that equal parts Shakespeare and today's headlines.
*27:19.260- 27:24.000* :  But why should people actually care about this battle between these billionaires?
*27:24.460- 27:29.840* :  It matters because ultimately, Murdoch's media properties have a profound influence around the world.
*27:30.620- 27:33.060* :  And don't take it from me. Take it from Preston Patton.
*27:33.160- 27:38.800* :  Patton was an executive who worked really closely with Rupert Murdoch in the 1990s, building Fox Broadcasting.
*27:39.560- 27:43.200* :  And Patton recently broke with Rupert and said, Fox News is hurting America.
*27:43.200- 27:44.740* :  The lies are hurting the country.
*27:45.300- 27:50.880* :  He's even trying to petition the American government to revoke a license to make it harder for Fox Operate.
*27:51.340- 27:53.960* :  And Patton said to me, it's so ironic.
*27:53.960- 28:00.120* :  It's hypocritical that they print the dirty laundry of every other family in the world on the front pages of their tabulates.
*28:00.940- 28:04.440* :  But they're blocking the media from gaining access to this trust proceeding.
*28:04.440- 28:07.200* :  And he said this proceeding matters for the following reason.
*28:07.300- 28:13.520* :  It will impact the public by determining the control of the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, etc.
*28:14.600- 28:16.600* :  And that is, I think, why everyone should care about this.
*28:17.100- 28:23.720* :  Because this does trigger an important conversation about the content that these networks and newspapers are publishing.
*28:24.400- 28:31.100* :  Whether you agree or disagree with the content, I look at Fox News and I think it's mostly opinion with a little bit of news added in once in a while.
*28:31.100- 28:33.720* :  It's not really Fox News channel. It's more like Fox opinion.
*28:34.460- 28:36.020* :  But it doesn't have to be that way, right?
*28:36.020- 28:38.220* :  James Murdoch has a very different vision of what it could be.
*28:38.800- 28:41.600* :  Maybe his sister's agree. Maybe they disagree. Maybe we'll find out someday.
*28:42.380- 28:43.460* :  What's the future of Fox News?
*28:43.880- 28:47.200* :  That's a question that can change the outcome of an American election.
*28:47.700- 28:50.400* :  Because it already has before and it may again in the future.
*28:50.860- 28:54.380* :  And just to add there for anyone thinking that sounds US centric, just remember,
*28:54.800- 28:57.400* :  the outcome of the US election affects us all.
*28:57.400- 29:03.140* :  And actually, you could argue that the president of America has more impact on foreign policy than they do in their own country.
*29:03.960- 29:05.420* :  So fascinating to talk to you both.
*29:05.660- 29:07.800* :  Katie Bryan, great to have you with us on the part.
