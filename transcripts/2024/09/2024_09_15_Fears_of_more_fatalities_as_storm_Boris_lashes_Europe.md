*01:35.120- 01:39.660* :  I'm Andrew Peach and in the early hours of Sunday the 15th of September these are our main
*01:39.660- 01:45.520* :  stories. Romania is setting up camps for thousands of people forced from their homes by its
*01:45.520- 01:50.800* :  severe flooding. The US National Security Adviser says intense discussions continue
*01:51.200- 01:55.300* :  on whether to allow Ukraine to fire western long-range missiles at Russia.
*01:56.160- 02:00.420* :  The former president of Peru Alberto Fujimori has been buried with full state
*02:00.420- 02:04.500* :  honors in a ceremony attended by family and friends in the capital Lima.
*02:06.340- 02:11.360* :  Also in this podcast there are estimated to be about a hundred thousand elephants and some
*02:11.360- 02:16.480* :  now that's double the recommended ecological balance of the elephants around.
*02:16.480- 02:21.500* :  Zimbabwe announces plans to coal elephants to feed people who are struggling to feed themselves

*02:31.660- 02:36.060* :  At least four people have been killed in Romania where thousands of homes have been damaged
*02:36.060- 02:40.620* :  and hundreds of people have been evacuated after some of the heaviest rain in years.
*02:41.100- 02:45.300* :  These people on the river Biala near the Czech border with Poland said they feared the worst.
*02:48.900- 02:53.420* :  I prepared sandbags and pumps but it's impossible to predict what's going to happen.
*02:53.420- 02:58.480* :  It's frightening. This is the second time in my life that I've seen such a phenomenon.
*02:59.100- 03:01.260* :  It's a nightmare for the people who live here.
*03:05.400- 03:07.840* :  Of course I'm scared everyone's afraid of water.
*03:08.060- 03:11.280* :  Water is the most powerful force of nature. Everyone's scared.
*03:11.960- 03:16.520* :  Maybe the bridges will be cut off because the water is still rising and there's no hope of the
*03:16.520- 03:20.160* :  rain stopping. Here's our Europe Regional Editor Charles Havelent.
*03:20.660- 03:25.340* :  Romania's prime minister, Marcel Cholakou and his interior and defense ministers
*03:25.820- 03:30.120* :  have all been visiting the inundated areas such as the seriousness of these floods.
*03:30.760- 03:36.540* :  With beds, blankets and food now ready at temporary camps, Mr Cholakou said the priority was to
*03:36.540- 03:41.580* :  prevent further deaths. Video shows firefighters carrying elderly people to safety,
*03:42.060- 03:44.860* :  military boats and planes are being used for rescues.
*03:45.460- 03:48.120* :  Tarentral rain has also hit neighbouring Moldova.
*03:48.120- 03:53.420* :  Dramatic footage from the capital Kishinau shows people being swept down a street
*03:53.420- 03:57.160* :  and coming up against stuck cars. Far to the west,
*03:57.160- 04:01.660* :  rains linked to the same cyclone have struck parts of the Czech Republic and Poland,
*04:01.660- 04:07.240* :  with Austria also braced for them. Polish and Czech streams have become roaring torrents
*04:07.540- 04:13.220* :  and people have been moved to safety. The Czech prime minister Petrofjala has warned of worst case
*04:13.220- 04:18.420* :  scenarios as more rain is predicted. In the giant mountains of northern Bohemia,
*04:18.420- 04:24.260* :  one woman uploaded video of rushing water courses which she said was unlike anything she'd seen
*04:24.260- 04:29.620* :  in 20 years living there. Meanwhile, Myanmar's military leader has made a rare request,
*04:29.620- 04:35.360* :  appealing for urgent international help to deal with deadly flooding in large parts of his country.
*04:35.360- 04:40.420* :  Minion Kling told officials to contact foreign governments for rescue and relief aid.
*04:41.000- 04:45.260* :  In the past, the military has blocked or frustrated humanitarian assistance from abroad
*04:45.660- 04:50.560* :  so it's underlined the gravity of this crisis. There aren't many confirmed details,
*04:50.560- 04:55.160* :  but initial reports suggest at least 160 people have died in recent days,
*04:55.560- 05:01.680* :  most in central and eastern Myanmar. These dissets spoke to Sohn Tan of the BBC's Burmese
*05:01.680- 05:07.580* :  Service and began by asking him how unusual this kind of appeal is. It's quite unprecedented.
*05:07.580- 05:13.540* :  The regime has this natural suspicion of international involvement in their own affairs,
*05:13.540- 05:20.040* :  but the regime has always been blested for refusing international offer of assistance even when
*05:20.040- 05:25.320* :  the country is going through some desperate moments. So this time in a way that it's
*05:25.320- 05:31.380* :  shows their desperation. Also, the regime chief want to show that he is willing to work with
*05:31.380- 05:37.140* :  the international community, but there is a caveat. They always insist that the international aid
*05:37.140- 05:42.220* :  even if it comes to Myanmar, then that should go through them. I mean, the aid could be delivered
*05:42.220- 05:47.780* :  to them and they will do the distribution. Is this in part because some of the worst-affected
*05:47.780- 05:54.360* :  areas are in rebel hands and the military would not want aid to go to them or are there other
*05:54.360- 06:00.700* :  issues? That's always the case. Even in Rakhine State or we had natural disasters in the past,
*06:00.760- 06:04.620* :  and the regime was quite suspicious that when the international aid would be delivered,
*06:04.620- 06:10.720* :  not through them, that would land in the hands of the opposition groups and troops. So they
*06:10.720- 06:16.100* :  always insisted that they would manage by themselves. Currently, also the affected areas,
*06:16.100- 06:21.840* :  many of those areas are in the hands of the rebel, but those sufferer are the local people.
*06:22.740- 06:28.180* :  When they say they want foreign aid, do they prefer that it comes from a country which they
*06:28.180- 06:33.820* :  have close relations like China, or do they make it clear that Western aid would be acceptable
*06:33.820- 06:39.500* :  this time? They didn't make it clear. The Hunta Ji just said that they would want international
*06:39.500- 06:44.860* :  aid to give to the affected peoples. Usually, what happens is that they are more comfortable
*06:44.860- 06:49.300* :  with the countries in the region, you know, ASEAN, Association of Southeast Asian Nation,
*06:49.800- 06:55.020* :  which Myanmar is a part of, ASEAN already set up ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Center,
*06:55.020- 07:01.360* :  which already started to deliver aid, although it's in a very small scale, to the war affected
*07:01.700- 07:07.600* :  and internally displaced people. So, I mean, it's likely that they would go first to that ASEAN
*07:07.600- 07:13.460* :  grouping in some individual countries, but still, it's likely that it would be very suspicious of
*07:13.460- 07:19.800* :  Western involvement. We've seen in disasters and other parts of the world in conflict that
*07:19.860- 07:27.520* :  they, out of the tragedy, comes possible political openings. Is there any desire on the part of
*07:27.520- 07:34.140* :  the military to end its isolation, to reach out to the West, and if so, with the West want to
*07:34.580- 07:40.320* :  reciprocate? Yeah, that is very difficult. With the history of the regimes, they have gone through
*07:40.320- 07:45.280* :  so many kind of disasters in conflict, and they are still also very deep in this conflict,
*07:45.280- 07:51.720* :  civil war, and they are also very suspicious of, especially the Western countries. They only
*07:51.720- 07:56.840* :  said that the opposition groups receive assistance from the Western countries, so they would be
*07:56.840- 08:01.280* :  quite reluctant. People are saying that we have seen in other like Arche and other international
*08:01.280- 08:08.080* :  conflicts, that disasters helped open the dialogue process and reconciliation, but Myanmar is
*08:08.080- 08:13.960* :  quite unlikely. And also the opposition side, they both are quite dead set on crushing the other,
*08:14.400- 08:19.040* :  so I don't see that this could be the very kind of big opening or opportunity for that kind of
*08:19.040- 08:25.520* :  conflict resolution. And that was so in turn from the BBC's Burmese service. The US National
*08:25.520- 08:30.680* :  Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says intense conversations are still taking place among Western
*08:30.680- 08:37.500* :  allies are whether to allow Ukraine to attack Russia with donated long-range weapons. This subject
*08:37.500- 08:42.480* :  was discussed on Friday at a meeting between the US President Joe Biden and the British Prime Minister
*08:42.480- 08:47.040* :  Kyastarma, but no conclusion was announced. The latest from Steve Jackson.
*08:47.620- 08:52.360* :  President Zelensky of Ukraine expressed frustration after the much-trumpeted meeting on Friday,
*08:52.360- 08:57.120* :  between the British and US leaders, he did no announcement on the use of long-range weapons.
*08:57.180- 09:02.660* :  But President Biden's top security adviser has now insisted the issue is still very much on the
*09:02.660- 09:07.460* :  agenda. Jake Sullivan spoke to a security conference in Kiev by video link.
*09:07.700- 09:14.360* :  And I think having a conversation that puts all of the pieces together, what we can offer up,
*09:14.740- 09:20.500* :  what we can support Ukraine with, and then how Ukraine looks at that in the context of a strategy
*09:20.500- 09:26.140* :  for diplomacy, and President Biden will still have four months left in his term, and he's determined
*09:26.140- 09:31.080* :  to use those four months to put Ukraine in the best possible position to prevail.
*09:31.660- 09:36.260* :  He also said that a substantial USAID package for Ukraine would be presented to Congress
*09:36.260- 09:41.920* :  later this month. Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine have been exchanging prisoners of war
*09:41.920- 09:48.420* :  with mediation from the United Arab Emirates. UAE state media said 103 prisoners from each
*09:48.420- 09:54.460* :  side were handed over, and it was Abu Dhabi's eighth such mediation. This Russian soldier couldn't
*09:54.460- 10:02.520* :  believe he was now free. I didn't expect all this. I am going. Everything is fine. I can't
*10:02.520- 10:07.980* :  even admit it yet. I'm overwhelmed with emotion. I don't even know how to say it. Everything is great.
*10:08.720- 10:12.960* :  The Russian Defense Ministry said its freed servicemen were currently in Belarus and receiving
*10:12.960- 10:21.080* :  help. On Friday, Ukraine said it received a further 49 captives from Russia. Peruvians have buried
*10:21.080- 10:27.180* :  their former president, Alberto Fujimori, in Lima. Despite previous convictions for human rights
*10:27.180- 10:32.240* :  abuses and corruption, he was granted a state funeral. Tens of thousands of Peruvians paid their
*10:32.240- 10:37.320* :  respects since his death on Wednesday, with many turning out to watch his funeral being screened
*10:37.320- 10:43.240* :  outside Lima's national theatre. Supporters chanted his nickname Chino as his coffin was carried to
*10:49.260- 10:54.420* :  the graveyard. Alberto Fujimori, governed Peru, with increasing the authoritarian hand in the 1990s,
*10:54.720- 10:59.580* :  and is credited with pulling the country out of economic crisis and defeating the shining path
*10:59.580- 11:04.540* :  in urgency. I've been talking to Leonardo Rosho, the BBC's America's regional editor,
*11:04.900- 11:08.680* :  I asked Leo, first of all, what is Fujimori's legacy? Bit of a mixed one.
*11:09.200- 11:16.160* :  Cheers indeed. I mean, he was convicted. He spent a long time in jail. He went abroad to Japan with
*11:16.160- 11:22.040* :  left power in 2000. Eventually, he was arrested until he came back. And he remained a divisive
*11:22.040- 11:29.820* :  figure in Peru. Of course, the victims of his attacks and with the time when he was in government,
*11:29.820- 11:37.660* :  most of them were poor, indigenous people. He was also accused of sterilizing indigenous people
*11:37.660- 11:42.620* :  against their will. So there are many things. But what I've seen in the past three days is really
*11:42.620- 11:48.560* :  overwhelming. People from all over the country went to pay the last respects to him. Many
*11:48.560- 11:53.660* :  went and interviewed. They said, look, he saved us from communism. They saved us from a brutal group,
*11:53.660- 12:00.020* :  the shining path of Senderro Luminoso. And also, they saved the country from hyperinflation.
*12:00.020- 12:05.560* :  The country was completely out of control, the economy. And he came to power. If you look back at
*12:05.560- 12:11.600* :  the history of Peru, recent history of instability, impeachment after impeachment, corruption of
*12:11.600- 12:18.660* :  presence, he was the last strong leader, Peru head. And just give me a sense of what the proceedings were
*12:19.080- 12:23.280* :  today with the state funeral that's been happening. Well, he'd been lying in state in this
*12:23.660- 12:30.140* :  national theater in the city center with thousands of people went there. And then there was a
*12:30.220- 12:36.480* :  Catholic mass there with the family very emotional. His daughter, Kiko Fujimori, who is the
*12:36.480- 12:44.460* :  political heir of the family, she went on stage there and she just said, look, he's finally free
*12:44.460- 12:50.400* :  of all the attacks, free of all the vengeance. And we'll stay united and we'll keep him his
*12:50.400- 12:55.900* :  name in politics. She is going to run for president again. In two years time, she nearly won the last
*12:55.900- 13:01.620* :  election and she looks very confident. And later, the body was taken to the presidential palace.
*13:02.180- 13:07.020* :  She also thanked the president, Gina Bolwati, for according to her not bowing to pressure from
*13:07.440- 13:13.200* :  international pressure and basically giving him a state funeral. And former Peruvian leaders were
*13:13.200- 13:19.060* :  there. I was surprised in a way that he had such honors after all the controversy. And eventually,
*13:19.060- 13:25.740* :  it was taken to a funeral where Kiko Fujimori again said, it's about time to leave behind all
*13:25.740- 13:30.720* :  these hatred and his division and put Peru first. That's a message, a message of a politician
*13:30.720- 13:35.040* :  who's running for president. Our America's regional editor, Leonardo Rocher.
*13:35.800- 13:40.180* :  More men have come forward, accusing the former chief executive of Abercrombian Fitch and
*13:40.180- 13:45.640* :  his British partner of sexual exploitation. Mike Jeffries and Matthew Smith have been facing
*13:45.640- 13:50.540* :  allegations that they exploited young men for sex at events they hosted around the world.
*13:51.060- 13:56.440* :  The FBI has been investigating after the BBC revealed there was a sophisticated operation involving
*13:56.440- 14:01.960* :  a middleman run for their benefit. Here's our investigation correspondent, Rihanna Croxford.
*14:02.320- 14:07.500* :  I didn't think it would ever come to light. I thought this was a very powerful individual who
*14:07.660- 14:16.120* :  was basically untouchable. This man who I'm calling Luke is one of 20 men I've now spoken with
*14:16.120- 14:21.760* :  who attended or helped organize sex events hosted by Mike Jeffries and his British partner.
*14:22.480- 14:29.560* :  These took place at their New York homes and hotels around the world from at least 2009 until 2015,
*14:29.560- 14:33.260* :  while Mr. Jeffries was chief executive if the fashion brand.
*14:33.560- 14:39.300* :  This whole hotel room was completely converted to being a literal Abercrombie store.
*14:40.020- 14:48.080* :  The photos and the tables, the plants, the cologne sense, it was like a movie set of us Abercrombie
*14:48.080- 14:53.760* :  store. And I thought we were going to do a photoshoot. In 2011, when he was 20, Luke says he
*14:53.760- 14:58.600* :  received a message on a modelling website from a talent scout working for Mr. Jeffries.
*14:58.600- 15:03.920* :  He says this man had offered him the chance of being in a company advert if he flew to Madrid.
*15:04.660- 15:10.220* :  But on arrival, he said he was taken to a hotel room, which resembled a mock Abercrombie store.
*15:10.960- 15:15.800* :  He says Mike Jeffries' assistants, young men in the brand's polos and flip flops,
*15:15.880- 15:19.300* :  were folding clothes, pretending to be shop workers.
*15:19.740- 15:24.780* :  In right away, it's like we go into character. The talent scout or house manager says,
*15:24.780- 15:29.580* :  all right guys, the first thing I want you to do is take off your shirts so you can, you know,
*15:30.520- 15:34.540* :  you guys would be the guys at the Abercrombie store being the shirtless models.
*15:35.640- 15:39.800* :  And he's like, all right now I have two very important guests I'm going to bring into the store
*15:39.800- 15:47.020* :  and these are going to be the customers that you need to impress. And that's when Michael Jeffries
*15:47.020- 15:54.060* :  and Mr. Smith came out of a corner of the room. Luke says Mr. Jeffries and his partner Matthew Smith
*15:54.060- 16:00.580* :  began touching him. He says the Abercrombie boss then performed oral sex on him and Mr. Smith
*16:00.580- 16:07.160* :  tried to do the same. How do you want any of that to happen? No, I mean definitely not,
*16:07.160- 16:12.500* :  absolutely not. I was trying to avoid the whole situation as much as I could but Michael was
*16:12.500- 16:18.060* :  very aggressive. I constantly was saying no and I wanted to go. The FBI began investigating
*16:18.060- 16:23.980* :  after the BBC revealed there was a sophisticated network involving a middleman tasked
*16:23.980- 16:30.180* :  with scouting men for these events. Mike Jeffries and his partner also face a civil lawsuit
*16:30.180- 16:35.820* :  accusing them of sex trafficking and rape. I'm not scared of the FBI and I'm also not scared
*16:35.820- 16:41.800* :  of a court. This is Diego Gillan, a real estate broker who says he's been interviewed by the FBI.
*16:41.980- 16:47.040* :  He says he would take the stand if necessary to defend Mike Jeffries.
*16:47.540- 16:54.360* :  Over the course of life, there's moments when people may have given you a hand for one thing
*16:54.360- 16:59.180* :  or for another and I am the type of person that believes that you should never forget that.
*16:59.600- 17:06.240* :  Back in 2011, Mr. Gillan says he was recruited while homeless and unemployed to attend several
*17:06.240- 17:11.280* :  of these sex events. He says that everyone who attended the events he was present at
*17:11.340- 17:20.140* :  were under no obligation under zero pressure and they were treated excellently in every respect.
*17:20.140- 17:26.920* :  He told the BBC there was also a roster of attendees. Other sources have said this database
*17:26.920- 17:32.980* :  could have as many as 60 different men on it, giving a snapshot of the scale of those recruited,
*17:32.980- 17:39.140* :  but Mr. Gillan's view differs to the other men I've spoken with. Some have said they understood
*17:39.140- 17:46.000* :  these events would be sexual, but not the specifics. Others like Luke have said they felt misled,
*17:46.000- 17:52.980* :  exploited and abused. There's an immense amount of shame associated with, you know, or this
*17:53.000- 17:58.560* :  image or idea that you're not a masculine man if you've been molested or taken advantage of by
*17:58.560- 18:04.900* :  another man. I want to have the message that people can overcome things like this in their life
*18:04.900- 18:10.740* :  and they can move forward. Mr. Jeffrey stepped down in 2014 after two decades in charge.
*18:11.620- 18:17.220* :  He and Mr. Smith did not respond to requests for comment. However, their lawyers have previously
*18:17.220- 18:24.180* :  said they deny allegations of wrongdoing. Abercrombian Fitch said it does not comment on legal matters
*18:24.780- 18:30.260* :  with multiple investigations underway. It's now for the authorities and the justice system

*20:27.080- 20:32.920* :  athlete Reka Cheptagay who died after being doused with petrol and set a light by her ex-boyfriend
*20:32.920- 20:39.680* :  in neighboring Kenya. The 33-year-olds succumb to burns covering 80% of her body. Our senior
*20:39.680- 20:43.240* :  Africa correspondent Anne Sawyer reports from Eastern Uganda.
*20:51.560- 20:57.720* :  An emotional send-off for one of Uganda's finest ambassadors. A sergeant in the armed forces
*20:58.100- 21:03.880* :  Reka Cheptagay's casket was draped in her country's flag and she was given a three-wallet salute.
*21:05.000- 21:09.960* :  Her fellow athletes wore black t-shirts with a message say no to gender-based violence.
*21:10.780- 21:14.640* :  The Kenyan sports minister Kipchumamur Komen spoke at the funeral.
*21:15.620- 21:23.540* :  We are guilty as government but also the community is guilty. It is not true that we did not know
*21:24.360- 21:29.860* :  even in the local community that Rebecca was facing family problems.
*21:30.500- 21:35.880* :  Rebecca Cheptagay is the third elite female athlete to have been allegedly killed by their current
*21:35.880- 21:43.480* :  or former partners in Kenya since 2021, prompting calls for action to tackle violence against women.
*21:44.560- 21:49.500* :  The government of South Sudan has been holding an emergency cabinet meeting hours after
*21:49.500- 21:54.280* :  announcing that long-delayed national elections during December will be postponed for another
*21:54.280- 21:59.840* :  two years. Here's Will Ross. The decision to postpone elections by another two years has
*21:59.840- 22:04.880* :  not come as a great surprise. The political leaders of South Sudan have not exactly been racing to
*22:04.880- 22:09.740* :  get ready for a vote. This has fueled suspicion that they're clinging onto power in the oil-rich
*22:09.740- 22:15.100* :  country. President Salva Keir's office says essential tasks like writing a new constitution
*22:15.140- 22:19.640* :  have to happen before there's an election. Those in charge are the same leaders who
*22:19.640- 22:25.720* :  plunge the country into a five-year-long civil war, given the current relative peace and the fact
*22:25.720- 22:31.460* :  that neighbouring Sudan is being destroyed by conflict, South Sudan's politicians may not come
*22:31.460- 22:37.420* :  under much international pressure. Will Ross reporting. Now this is from the ballet Giselle.
*22:43.460- 22:49.100* :  The ballerina Mikaela de Prince performed in Giselle in 2020. Her death has just been announced at
*22:49.100- 22:55.220* :  the age of 29. A family statement sent she was an inspiration to everyone who heard her story.
*22:55.740- 23:00.820* :  Mikaela de Prince was born during Sierra Leone civil war, which took the lives of both of her parents.
*23:00.860- 23:06.500* :  She went to the US as a four-year-old where her adopted family nurtured her love of ballet.
*23:07.080- 23:12.860* :  A culture correspondent, Nor Nanji taught me more about her life. She did have a really fascinating
*23:12.920- 23:20.340* :  life. She was born in Sierra Leone in 1995 and she was sent to an orphanage when she was just
*23:20.340- 23:27.280* :  three years old and that's after both of her parents died during the civil war. She had spoken
*23:27.280- 23:33.740* :  in the past about how she was seen as almost a devil's child in the orphanage because she suffered
*23:33.740- 23:39.740* :  from her condition in which patches of her skin were losing pigmentation and she was also told
*23:39.740- 23:45.740* :  that she would never be adopted but she was adopted at the age of four by an American couple and
*23:45.740- 23:52.880* :  that's when she moved to the US to New Jersey and her adoptive mother quickly noticed that she was
*23:52.880- 23:58.900* :  really obsessed with ballet and enrolled her into classes and then she from then on was she
*23:58.900- 24:05.440* :  rose to fame. She made history as the youngest principal dancer at the dance theatre of Harlem
*24:05.960- 24:10.740* :  and she has performed all across the world including in a music video for Beyoncé which a lot
*24:10.740- 24:17.440* :  of people will remember. It sounds like her original background, her birth background had a whole
*24:17.440- 24:22.180* :  list of reasons why she wouldn't have ended up in this profession. She wouldn't have ended up
*24:22.180- 24:26.540* :  in the world of ballet and maybe the adoption was the key moment that made that happen.
*24:27.080- 24:32.060* :  I think so. I mean she's often been described as a war orphan so obviously you know things were
*24:32.060- 24:36.960* :  stacked against her if you like when she was when she was very young but clearly that moved to
*24:36.960- 24:42.080* :  the US and you know having an adoptive set of parents who obviously you know were able to spot
*24:42.080- 24:46.800* :  her talent and really nurture that from a young age clearly made a really big difference for her.
*24:47.020- 24:52.020* :  What sort of legacy does she leave in the world of ballet because she's a trailblazer for many people?
*24:52.400- 24:56.840* :  That's right and I mean that's sort of the the gist of what people are saying about her today with
*24:56.840- 25:03.320* :  this very sad news. People are calling her a trailblazer. Her spokesperson said that she had touched
*25:03.320- 25:09.520* :  countless hearts and inspired many leaving a mark on the world of ballet and beyond. They said
*25:09.520- 25:15.100* :  that her life was defined by grace, purpose and strength and that she was unwaveringly committed
*25:15.140- 25:20.300* :  to the arts and also to her humanitarian efforts and I think that's also an important part of the
*25:20.360- 25:25.300* :  story. She was really a campaigner for other young children who'd gone through similar things and
*25:25.300- 25:29.120* :  I think that's very important considering where she also came from.
*25:29.580- 25:35.500* :  Norlandia culture correspondent. Symbar Ways facing a severe drought that's led to food shortages.
*25:35.920- 25:39.740* :  Now the government has come up with a controversial plan to try and feed its citizens.
*25:40.380- 25:46.020* :  It's going to call 200 elephants and then distribute their meat to those who need it.
*25:46.800- 25:49.140* :  I asked our reporter Camilla Mills why they're doing this now.
*25:49.660- 25:54.460* :  There are a number of reasons. First and foremost there are estimated to be about 100,000
*25:54.460- 25:59.860* :  elephants in Symbar Ways. Now that's double the recommended ecological balance of elephants
*25:59.860- 26:06.180* :  around. So there's been as well as the issue of there being a kind of human elephant conflict added
*26:06.180- 26:11.800* :  to this is now the El Nino drought that is happening in southern Africa. Five countries in the
*26:11.800- 26:17.960* :  region are being impacted by it and these are the worst droughts that we have seen in decades.
*26:18.820- 26:23.520* :  Now it's left millions facing hunger so one of the solutions has been to kill
*26:23.520- 26:28.540* :  wild animals. We saw this happen last month in Namibia a number of wild animals were killed
*26:28.540- 26:33.220* :  including over 80 elephants and now this happening in Symbar Ways they're going to be roughly
*26:33.220- 26:39.660* :  200 elephants killed. I have a sense of listeners elsewhere in the world outraged about the idea
*26:39.660- 26:44.720* :  that anyone would kill an elephant. They're just those animals that have a special emotional
*26:44.720- 26:49.220* :  relationship with us somehow if you've never been anywhere near one. Is that true in Symbar
*26:49.220- 26:54.760* :  way? Do people feel like that about elephants there? Yeah elephants are a huge symbol of strength
*26:54.760- 27:01.000* :  and prosperity and they're used as luck symbols as well but something that you've got to remember
*27:01.000- 27:08.200* :  is these elephants are huge mammals. Imagine how much water and food they need but conservationists as
*27:08.200- 27:13.140* :  you say are outraged by this because they are emotionally intelligent and apparently they can
*27:13.140- 27:18.560* :  experience trauma. So there will be people within Symbar Ways and globally who are outraged.
*27:18.820- 27:23.660* :  In fact, culling of elephants was very popular in the 80s and 90s and the reason it really tailed
*27:23.660- 27:30.140* :  off was because of the global backlash. And how exactly do you go about it because logistically
*27:30.140- 27:37.260* :  it can't be easy? What generally happens is that specific animals are targeted and they're targeted
*27:37.260- 27:43.280* :  in their entire family unit so an entire family will be killed then what will happen is the meat
*27:43.280- 27:47.340* :  will be dried it will be packaged and there's going to be a feeding scheme that will go to
*27:47.340- 27:52.940* :  predominantly schools and prisons. So rather than the elephant seating more food than is available
*27:53.760- 27:58.320* :  these 200 elephants are going to be used as food. Yeah they are going to be used as food they're
*27:58.320- 28:04.800* :  going to be sent to people who are in dire need of just basic food but also in need of protein
*28:04.800- 28:11.780* :  as it stands there are about 42% of Symbar Ways live in poverty and the authorities there say that
*28:11.780- 28:17.540* :  6 million will require food assistance between November and March. Camilla Mills reporting.
*28:18.200- 28:22.440* :  According to the British newspaper The Financial Times, Italian baristas are concerned about
*28:22.440- 28:28.680* :  the future of their cheap espressos as the global price of coffee surges. So vital is the espresso
*28:28.680- 28:34.400* :  in lubricating daily life in Italy that prices were once regulated by the state. At the moment
*28:34.400- 28:41.800* :  Italians enjoy a shot from about 1 euro 20 that's around $1.33 as a comparison the average takeaway
*28:41.800- 28:49.560* :  coffee here in London is around $4.50. Amy Kasmin is a financial times journalist in Rome my colleague
*28:49.560- 28:55.120* :  Caroline White asked her what's going on with the price of coffee. The price of the espresso shot
*28:55.120- 29:02.120* :  is rising and could rise further and that is causing quite a lot of heartache here in Italy.
*29:02.520- 29:08.520* :  Italians have grown very accustomed to very affordable coffee they pay some of the lowest prices
*29:09.060- 29:17.660* :  in all of Europe. You can easily find a shot for a euro or maybe 1.2 euros and that's just a fraction
*29:17.660- 29:24.280* :  of the price in some of the other northern European capitals but baristas have been complaining of
*29:24.280- 29:31.540* :  mounting costs and now global coffee bean prices are also surging because of bad weather and that
*29:31.540- 29:38.140* :  has started to trigger a lot of predictions that prices are going to have to rise and there's a
*29:38.140- 29:45.500* :  lot of agitation in the market. Historically the prices were regulated in order to keep the cost of
*29:45.500- 29:51.900* :  an espresso affordable to the common man. There is also a phenomenon of people literally rushing
*29:51.900- 29:59.860* :  into a bar and standing up at the counter and knocking back an espresso liquidy split and leaving
*30:01.360- 30:09.060* :  and this has always been very affordable so the concern now is that if prices rise it's going
*30:09.060- 30:15.220* :  to put a real strain on consumer pockets. What happens do you think if the bars the baristas
*30:15.220- 30:21.500* :  are forced to put prices out will people actually pay for them? Well so in fact baristas
*30:21.500- 30:26.560* :  many baristas will tell you that in the last two years they have already been forced to raise
*30:26.560- 30:33.060* :  prices somewhat because of rising costs linked to things like the war in Ukraine and the surging
*30:33.060- 30:39.240* :  energy prices that was associated with that and other inflationary pressures that made the old
*30:39.240- 30:45.700* :  prices some of which was under a euro per shot. So baristas did raise prices and they said that
*30:45.700- 30:52.400* :  they endured grumbles from their customers but they really had no choice. A bar in LaGuria when
*30:52.400- 30:59.000* :  faced with the grumbles of customers even put up a sign saying we'll give you espresso for
*30:59.020- 31:07.700* :  70 cents if you bring your own cup spoon and sugar from home but bars are very embedded in their
*31:07.700- 31:14.340* :  local communities outside the center tourist areas. Many baristas are very much a part of the
*31:14.340- 31:19.180* :  fabric of the places where they live so they're sensitive to the price pressures on their own
*31:19.180- 31:25.020* :  customers and they're really reluctant to raise prices but there are other strategies people will
*31:25.020- 31:30.660* :  tell you that they'll raise the price of a cappuccino more or they'll raise the price of some of
*31:30.660- 31:37.960* :  the food a little bit more in order to hold that espresso price down because it just seems so
*31:37.960- 31:45.020* :  symbolic and so resonant. Literally you can always find a coffee at any hour at any location
*31:46.540- 31:51.280* :  but the question is how many of these baristas can continue to sustain themselves in business
*31:51.280- 31:57.040* :  and there's a lot of pressure both ways. The Financial Times journalist Amy Kasmin in Italy.
*31:58.220- 32:03.240* :  It's a bit of a cliche to say someone's suffered for their art but the Dutch post-impressionist
*32:03.240- 32:08.880* :  painter Vincent Van Gogh really did. I put my heart and my soul into my work he once said and
*32:08.880- 32:14.540* :  have lost my mind in the process. Rising about his famous paintings of Wheatfields he said they
*32:14.540- 32:20.920* :  represented his sadness and extreme loneliness. Now given that Van Gogh took his own life at the age
*32:20.920- 32:27.680* :  of 37 in 1890. It might sound a bit of a tall order to put on an exhibition about his happy times
*32:28.200- 32:32.240* :  but the National Gallery in London has done just that as Vincent Dowd now reports.
*32:34.940- 32:40.860* :  No Van Gogh exhibition would seek to disguise his sad end but Van Gogh poets and lovers
*32:40.860- 32:48.700* :  focuses on the last two years of his life to show there were moments of joy as well even in his time
*32:48.700- 32:55.320* :  at the San Remy asylum in Provence in the south of France where he went seeking the mental balance
*32:55.320- 33:02.720* :  he knew he lacked. Christopher Riapel is the co-curator. The vast majority of Vincent's career is
*33:02.720- 33:08.420* :  euphoric. With our tales of Wulbegon Vincent we missed the fact this was a man in control of his
*33:08.420- 33:14.800* :  own life. This image shows the hospital at San Remy but look how he transforms the garden we
*33:14.800- 33:21.200* :  have photographs of it those trees aren't there. He is inventing this wonderful space where these
*33:21.200- 33:27.600* :  trees take on they're almost like giant stancing. Very colorful particularly the range of greens
*33:27.600- 33:33.640* :  and the way they play into the blues is really wonderful but we notice in the lower left corner a
*33:33.640- 33:40.800* :  woman with a beautiful parasol overhead which is just a slash of bright red to animate the picture.
*33:41.220- 33:47.780* :  Chris we've come into a different room where the big centerpiece is the two images of sunflowers
*33:48.220- 33:53.640* :  hugely famous in terms of vangoff. Why was Vincent obsessed with sunflowers?
*33:54.460- 34:00.100* :  There are a number of reasons he saw a lot of symbolism in the sun, life, blooming etc.
*34:00.100- 34:06.280* :  They have so much sunlight they kind of create a feeling of sun in us. You're you're blasted
*34:06.280- 34:12.760* :  by sunshine looking at them but you're also again so drawn to the physicality of the way he paints
*34:12.800- 34:18.740* :  those things big thick strokes of color that stand proud on the canvas. Here in the next room
*34:19.320- 34:27.120* :  three pictures clearly from San Remy. Did he change his color palette in the relatively short time
*34:27.120- 34:34.100* :  he was in San Remy? The palette just gets brighter and brighter and purer. I mean more and more you
*34:34.100- 34:41.080* :  see just pure colors laid down on the canvas with incredible vivacity. He always thought it
*34:41.080- 34:47.460* :  realized he could do great things with yellow. What do you suspect Vincent most liked painting?
*34:47.820- 34:53.820* :  He loved being confronted by people and there is a certain joy in the portraits as well but it
*34:53.820- 35:02.160* :  is much more a sense of a face-to-face confrontation. If we look at his take on human beings close up
*35:02.560- 35:07.820* :  they're wonderfully detailed and there's often a sort of spark to them and that that sense of
*35:07.820- 35:12.080* :  a personal engagement is there. He loved people. What are people going to learn from this exhibition
*35:12.080- 35:18.220* :  Chris that they haven't learnt before? Vincent was in control of his own career he was plotting his
*35:18.220- 35:24.240* :  own career how he and his friends were going to make it as independent avant-garde artists in the
