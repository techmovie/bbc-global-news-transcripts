*01:31.820- 01:38.660* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Janet Jolila at 13 hours GMT on
*01:38.660- 01:44.240* :  Friday the 13th of September. These are our main stories. Moscow announces it has expelled six
*01:44.240- 01:49.360* :  British diplomats as President Putin warns the West against allowing Ukraine to use long-range
*01:49.360- 01:55.020* :  missiles on Russia. China is to raise its retirement age, one of the lowest for a major economy.
*01:55.880- 02:01.800* :  Workers at the troubled plainmaker Boeing have gone on strike, rejecting a pay offer of 25%.
*02:04.840- 02:10.840* :  Also in this podcast, we hear about some of science's wackiest ideas, including putting pigeons
*02:11.020- 02:13.420* :  in missiles to guide their flight paths.
*02:18.060- 02:23.700* :  We start with high-stakes diplomacy. Tensions have risen as a British Prime Minister and the US
*02:23.700- 02:28.980* :  President prepared a whole talks in Washington about allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles
*02:28.980- 02:34.540* :  for strikes deep inside Russia. After reports that Iran was now supplying hundreds of
*02:34.540- 02:40.120* :  missiles for Moscow to use, President Putin warned the West that giving long-range weapons to
*02:40.120- 02:44.080* :  Ukraine would mean that NATO countries were at war with Russia.
*02:45.440- 02:51.580* :  If this decision is made, it will mean nothing other than direct participation of NATO countries,
*02:52.080- 02:58.840* :  the United States, European countries, in the war in Ukraine. It is their direct participation,
*02:59.440- 03:03.800* :  and this, of course, significantly changes the very essence of the conflict.
*03:04.660- 03:10.320* :  This will mean that NATO countries, the United States, European countries, are fighting with Russia.
*03:14.860- 03:20.320* :  Then hours after Mr. Putin's warning, Moscow announced that it had expelled six British diplomats,
*03:20.320- 03:26.240* :  accusing them of spying and sabotage. Here's how Russian State Television broadcasts the news to
*03:26.540- 03:38.640* :  the viewers. British diplomats have been accused of espionage. How did the British Embassy in Moscow
*03:38.640- 03:43.520* :  turn into a branch of MI6? The photographs of the six diplomats then appear on screen.
*03:44.240- 03:49.520* :  Britain has dismissed the Russian accusations as completely baseless, saying the six diplomats had
*03:49.520- 03:54.280* :  left Russia many weeks ago, after having their accreditation revoked in separate circumstances.
*03:55.040- 03:59.400* :  Our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford, who is in the Polish capital Warsaw,
*03:59.960- 04:03.720* :  told us more about what the Russians have been saying. They're saying that their
*04:03.720- 04:10.280* :  actions were found to contain signs of intelligence and subversive work. That's the kind of bottom line.
*04:10.960- 04:17.860* :  But more broadly than that, the FSB is also claiming that Britain is responsible for escalating
*04:17.860- 04:23.300* :  the tensions between Russia and the West, what it calls the military political situation. It
*04:23.300- 04:29.080* :  claims that Britain is coordinating this escalation, and that in fact it's saying that the Department
*04:29.080- 04:35.280* :  of the Foreign Office is specifically responsible for the attempts to defeat Russia strategically.
*04:35.280- 04:40.540* :  In terms of what evidence it has of any kind of subversion by these six specific individuals,
*04:40.540- 04:46.720* :  well, the only video that I've seen so far is of Embassy officials meeting independent Russian
*04:46.720- 04:52.300* :  journalists and human rights activists. People who Russia has portrayed and claims are its
*04:52.320- 04:57.640* :  internal enemies, and so it's talking about those meetings as being subversive.
*04:58.080- 05:04.920* :  And it seems the timing is like a diplomatic warning shot, because the UK Prime Minister
*05:04.920- 05:10.800* :  Kierstama is in Washington where he's going to meet President Biden to talk about Ukraine's
*05:11.260- 05:16.540* :  longstanding request to be allowed to use long-range missiles to strike deep into Russia.
*05:17.520- 05:23.060* :  Yes, and I think the timing is absolutely key. I mean, there are diplomatic expulsions periodically,
*05:23.120- 05:29.080* :  and the relationship is dire. This does happen, but I think the announcement right now of this
*05:29.080- 05:34.720* :  particular group of people being expelled, the timing is no coincidence. It's certainly about
*05:34.720- 05:41.220* :  this broader narrative of Russia and the West at war, which is of course what Vladimir Putin
*05:41.720- 05:48.820* :  is warning will be the case if the West goes ahead and gives approval for Ukraine to use
*05:48.880- 05:55.280* :  long-range missiles, Western missiles, inside Russia. But it is interesting that of course Kierstama,
*05:55.280- 06:00.960* :  the British Prime Minister, has given a robust response already to that, saying that Ukraine has
*06:00.960- 06:05.820* :  the right to self-defense. And I've heard also today from the Polish Prime Minister Donald
*06:05.820- 06:11.500* :  Tusk saying that the West essentially shouldn't set too much store by these threats and these warnings
*06:11.500- 06:17.180* :  from Vladimir Putin, saying he's simply trying to discourage the West from providing military aid,
*06:17.180- 06:23.480* :  and in fact his words should rather convince the West that this aid is advisable. Donald Tusk said
*06:23.860- 06:30.020* :  necessary and should continue. Nevertheless, there will be many people worried about the the threat
*06:30.040- 06:37.420* :  of escalation. If Russia was to retaliate to the West supplying Ukraine with long-range missiles,
*06:37.420- 06:42.220* :  what form could that retaliation take? I think it's important to remember that already and for a
*06:42.220- 06:47.240* :  very long time Russia has referred to what's happening in Ukraine as its war with the collective
*06:47.240- 06:52.080* :  West as it describes it. So I think that in itself is not an escalation, but if Russia were to
*06:52.080- 06:58.740* :  retaliate, then I suppose the fear is multi-fold. I mean there's everything on the, I suppose,
*06:58.740- 07:07.300* :  ranging from some kind of hybrid attack, more sabotage in Europe, more hacking to something as
*07:07.520- 07:12.500* :  major as potentially a strike against supply routes for Western missiles into Ukraine. And of
*07:12.500- 07:18.280* :  course Poland, where I am now, is a key part of that logistical operation. But of course, escalating
*07:18.340- 07:24.080* :  to the point where Russia were to strike against a NATO country is massive. And I think the chances
*07:24.080- 07:29.540* :  of that as far as Western politicians at this point see it seem relatively slim because of
*07:29.540- 07:35.880* :  course when President Biden was here in Poland not so long ago, he made clear that the US and NATO
*07:35.880- 07:39.740* :  would defend every inch of NATO territory if it was to come under attack.
*07:40.800- 07:46.800* :  Sarah Reinsford in the Polish capital Warsaw. In Russia itself, ever since the full-scale invasion
*07:46.800- 07:52.360* :  of Ukraine, there have been widespread cases of Russians reporting fellow citizens to the police
*07:52.360- 07:57.740* :  for anti-war views, often leading to prosecution and in some cases prison sentences.
*07:58.780- 08:04.020* :  This has revived memories of the Soviet past when informing on colleagues and labours was actively
*08:04.020- 08:09.360* :  encouraged. Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg has been meeting some of those caught up in this
*08:09.360- 08:17.440* :  new wave of denunciations. Handcuffed, a doctor is led into a Moscow courtroom,
*08:17.440- 08:30.900* :  and locked in a cage. Her name is Nadzieszda Bojanova. She's 68, she's a pediatrician,
*08:31.440- 08:35.940* :  and she's on trial for spreading false information about the Russian army.
*08:36.740- 08:39.220* :  She faces up to 10 years in prison.
*08:43.120- 08:45.960* :  I managed to ask Nadzieszda what she makes of this.
*08:48.500- 08:53.160* :  I read about this kind of thing happening to others. Nadzieszda replies through the glass,
*08:54.040- 08:56.300* :  I never imagined it would happen to me.
*08:59.620- 09:05.480* :  It's happening because of this woman, a patient's mother. She claims that the doctor told her
*09:05.940- 09:11.980* :  Russian soldiers in Ukraine are legitimate targets. She was furious. Her ex-husband
*09:12.020- 09:16.940* :  had been killed fighting in Ukraine. She denounced Nadzieszda to the police.
*09:20.660- 09:26.640* :  One of Stalin's ministers praises a boy who has denounced his own father as an enemy of the
*09:26.680- 09:34.260* :  people. Denunciation was actively encouraged under Stalin. The Gulag was full of victims who'd
*09:34.260- 09:40.300* :  been snitched on by fellow citizens. Nina Flushava is professor of international affairs
*09:40.660- 09:46.780* :  at the New School in New York. She can see that today, Russians are having no problem turning
*09:46.780- 09:52.720* :  the clock back. What I find really remarkable is how quickly Russian genetic memory has come back,
*09:53.440- 09:59.500* :  how people who didn't live in those times suddenly act as if they did. Suddenly they are
*09:59.500- 10:05.200* :  squealing on others. It is a Soviet practice, but it's also something about the Russian genetic code,
*10:05.200- 10:09.500* :  or fear of trying to protect themselves at the expense of others.
*10:09.980- 10:15.580* :  And it is Russia's war in Ukraine, which is fueling this. Not only through repressive new laws,
*10:15.580- 10:22.960* :  aimed at silencing dissent, but by turbocharging here, the hunt for internal enemies, for traitors.
*10:23.880- 10:30.320* :  It's in this atmosphere of us against them that you get students informing on teachers,
*10:30.920- 10:40.620* :  professors on students, parishioners on priests. Some Russians aren't just writing denunciations,
*10:40.780- 10:50.840* :  they're taking the law into their own hands. On a Moscow bus, 87-year-old Demetri Grinchy
*10:51.200- 10:57.360* :  is attacked by two men who claim they've just heard him make insulting comments about Russian
*10:57.360- 11:06.040* :  mercenaries fighting in Ukraine. Shocking mobile phone video shows the pensioner having his arms
*11:06.040- 11:11.700* :  twisted behind his back, then being dragged off the bus and frog marched to the police.
*11:12.620- 11:17.640* :  He wasn't charged, but the incident has left the pensioner shaken and angry.
*11:21.100- 11:27.340* :  The Russian constitution says that everyone has the right to free speech, Demetri tells me,
*11:28.260- 11:37.560* :  why should others get to say what they think and not me? In his flat, Demetri shows me old photos
*11:37.560- 11:45.480* :  of his father, Pavel, who in 1937 was arrested and then executed. One of the many innocent victims
*11:45.480- 11:52.900* :  of Stalin's terror. History never repeats itself exactly, but what is happening today is
*11:52.900- 11:59.760* :  reviving ghosts of the past. With Russia, once again, searching for enemies and traitors and
*11:59.760- 12:07.860* :  Russians being encouraged to join the hunt. Steve Rosenberg reports have emerged of a raid by
*12:07.860- 12:12.840* :  Israeli special forces in Syria to destroy a Hezbollah missile production facility in the country.
*12:13.480- 12:18.400* :  Israel has not commented on the operation, which according to US media reports, took place
*12:18.400- 12:23.000* :  at the beginning of the week. With more details, here's our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams.
*12:23.820- 12:27.120* :  American and other officials quoted in the New York Times and elsewhere,
*12:27.120- 12:32.320* :  paint a picture of a daring operation designed to destroy an underground military facility
*12:32.320- 12:38.760* :  near the Syrian city of Masyaf, around 25 miles north of the Lebanese border. According to
*12:38.760- 12:44.340* :  The Times, Israeli special forces descended from helicopters, placed explosives inside the
*12:44.340- 12:49.860* :  Iranian-built facility and removed sensitive information. Air strikes were used to neutralize
*12:49.860- 12:55.080* :  Syria's defenses and prevent reinforcements from reaching the site. The Israeli government has
*12:55.080- 12:59.900* :  not commented, but the raid seems to have been designed to prevent Iran from supplying precision
*12:59.900- 13:06.140* :  missiles to its Lebanese ally and proxy Hezbollah. Israel attacked the facilities six years ago
*13:06.460- 13:11.460* :  and has mounted dozens of air strikes against Syria since the war in Gaza began almost a year ago.
*13:12.140- 13:18.040* :  But putting Israeli troops on the ground inside Syria is highly unusual. This would be one
*13:18.040- 13:24.080* :  of the most sophisticated operations of its kind in years. Paul Adams, as you may have heard in
*13:24.080- 13:30.000* :  our last global podcast, workers at the US Airplane Giant Boeing were voting on a new contract.
*13:30.540- 13:36.980* :  Well, they've now downed tools and gone on strike after overwhelmingly rejecting the deal that
*13:36.980- 13:44.760* :  included a 25% pay rise. More than 30,000 employees who produce planes including the 737 MAX
*13:44.760- 13:50.340* :  are taking part in the walk out. Speaking at a news conference, John Holden, who led the negotiations
*13:50.340- 13:55.980* :  for the IAM Union, explained why members had rejected the proposed contract and voted for
*13:55.980- 14:00.700* :  strike action instead. While there were many important things that were in this offer,
*14:01.480- 14:06.960* :  it didn't make up, it didn't bridge the gap for 16 years from 2008 and going through two
*14:06.960- 14:14.000* :  extensions and the threats of job loss, you know, stagnated wages, cost shift on health care,
*14:14.540- 14:21.080* :  and many other issues and especially relocation of thousands of jobs for, you know, other programs
*14:21.080- 14:26.640* :  leaving the state. Well, the walk out is yet another setback for Boeing, which is facing deepening
*14:26.640- 14:31.920* :  financial losses as it struggles to repair its reputation after a series of safety issues,
*14:32.560- 14:38.020* :  including two fatal crashes. Our business correspondent, Theo Leggett, told us why the overwhelming
*14:38.020- 14:43.900* :  majority of Boeing workers had rejected a pay offer that on the face of it seemed quite generous.
*14:44.700- 14:51.900* :  The margin by which this offer was rejected, 96% of those pulled, was enormous and it does
*14:51.900- 14:57.360* :  really illustrate that there's been a very serious breakdown of trust between Boeing's management
*14:57.960- 15:02.860* :  and the workers in the Pacific Northwest, so we're talking the Seattle region and also Portland
*15:02.860- 15:09.480* :  and Oregon. And the reason for this, as that IAM representative was suggesting, goes back years.
*15:09.920- 15:15.940* :  So during past contract renegotiations, Boeing was in a position of some strength and it went
*15:15.940- 15:22.380* :  into negotiations threatening the unions that if concessions weren't made, then production might
*15:22.380- 15:28.160* :  be moved to other states where labor laws would be different and it could enforce cutbacks,
*15:28.160- 15:33.860* :  whichever way it wanted to. So for example, in the past Boeing workers had to give up quite
*15:33.860- 15:40.060* :  nice pension plans and paid demands were kept to a minimum and as a result of that there is this
*15:40.620- 15:44.400* :  inbuilt resentment within Boeing's workforce put on top of that what's been happening
*15:44.400- 15:49.940* :  over the past few years when Boeing's been trying to ramp up production particularly of the 737 Max
*15:49.940- 15:54.720* :  and production rates at the factories until recently were going up and up and there were protests
*15:54.720- 15:58.820* :  on the production line that people were simply being overworked. So take all of that together
*15:58.820- 16:04.200* :  and you have this offer which on the face of it seemed quite generous, which union leaders said
*16:04.200- 16:08.760* :  was one of the best contract offers they'd ever come up with but it's still not good enough.
*16:09.340- 16:16.300* :  Fear like it. Butterfly thieves in Sri Lanka have been hit with a massive fine of $200,000.
*16:17.120- 16:22.340* :  Two men, a father and son from Italy were caught trying to smuggle hundreds of dead insects including
*16:22.340- 16:28.280* :  92 species of butterflies out of a safari park and handed the country's highest ever fine for
*16:28.280- 16:33.900* :  wildlife crime but as David Lewis reports if they can't pay it it could get even worse for them.
*16:34.540- 16:40.420* :  It's a family holiday that ended with mass insect death convictions of smuggling and possible
*16:40.420- 16:46.980* :  prison time. Luigi Ferardi and his 28 year old son Mathia were arrested back in May after they
*16:46.980- 16:52.820* :  were found with hundreds of dead butterflies in the boot of their high car. According to investigators
*16:52.820- 16:59.180* :  the pair had reportedly lured the animals at Yala National Park using specialist bait and were
*16:59.180- 17:05.020* :  planning on chemically preserving them but their strategy did not go to plan. Park Ranger,
*17:05.020- 17:12.100* :  K. Sejiro Nishanta told BBC that a suspicious car was spotted in the park on the day of the incident
*17:12.100- 17:17.680* :  and the driver and passenger in it had crept into the forest with insect nets.
*17:17.740- 17:23.080* :  Local workers found hundreds of jars containing the insects in bags in the back.
*17:23.080- 17:29.120* :  All the insects were dead when we found them, Mr Nishanta said. They put a chemical in the bottles
*17:29.120- 17:34.800* :  he alleged. Yala National Park in the southeast of the island is one of Sri Lanka's most popular
*17:34.800- 17:40.420* :  wildlife spots. It's home to leopards, elephants and buffaloes as well as a variety of insects.
*17:40.420- 17:47.360* :  For their roles dad and son face hundreds of charges initially slapped with 801 citations.
*17:47.360- 17:54.140* :  This has now been reduced to 304. They're facing two years in a local prison if the 60 million
*17:54.140- 18:01.640* :  rupee or $200,000 fine isn't met by the end of this month. Friends of the pair back home have pleaded
*18:01.640- 18:08.720* :  for leniency, suggesting the butterflies had no commercial value. Mr Ferardi Sr is an orthopedic
*18:08.720- 18:15.580* :  surgeon. He's been described by pals as an insect enthusiast and is a member of the Entomology
*18:15.580- 18:20.540* :  Association in the city of Moderna, Entomology being the study of insects.
*18:21.500- 18:27.100* :  David Lewis reporting. Now science can be about making people think, but it could also be about
*18:27.100- 18:32.560* :  making them laugh while thinking. And that's what this year's Ig Nobel Prizes in the US are all
*18:32.560- 18:38.500* :  about. Among the scientific achievements being celebrated are research on the possibility of
*18:38.500- 18:44.820* :  placing pigeons inside missiles to better guide them and the discovery that dead fish
*18:45.220- 18:47.600* :  can swim. Alfie Havishan reports.
*18:54.080- 18:58.460* :  Many of us are keen to hear how scientists plan to fix the world's growing list of problems.
*18:58.960- 19:02.960* :  And there was a sense of anticipation at MIT University on Thursday night,
*19:02.960- 19:07.020* :  bummed shuffled onto seats to the tune of a harmonica player at the front of the stage.
*19:07.020- 19:10.160* :  But this time the solutions were a little unusual.
*19:10.160- 19:20.280* :  The winner is the late BF Skinner for experiments to see the feasibility of housing live pigeons
*19:21.220- 19:26.780* :  inside missiles to guide the flight paths of the missiles.
*19:27.940- 19:31.660* :  That's because the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony invites scientists to do something that don't
*19:31.660- 19:37.320* :  normally do, use discoveries to make us laugh. For example by explaining that people famous for
*19:37.320- 19:42.640* :  living a long time often come from places with very bad death keeping records or that dead
*19:42.640- 19:48.500* :  trouts are quite good at swimming. Using its body like a sailboat to tack up wind,
*19:48.540- 19:54.940* :  its torso undulating, acting as a lift producing sail and a stabilizing keel at the same time.
*19:55.800- 20:01.760* :  Fluids flap flexible fish forward from forces and feedback. The water swims the fish.
*20:05.520- 20:09.960* :  And many of them seem to relish the opportunity to strip off the lab coat and loosen up a bit,
*20:10.260- 20:13.740* :  at times performing strange dances as they accepted their prizes.
*20:14.360- 20:17.080* :  It might show the scientists are not as serious as we think,
*20:17.080- 20:22.300* :  but just like the eye-watering grass and complex data, their sense of humour can leave us with
*20:22.300- 20:23.900* :  a similar sense of confusion.
*20:27.420- 20:29.380* :  That report by Alfie Habeson
*20:32.880- 20:37.980* :  Still to come, the end of the road for the grand tour with no more pub banter.
*20:38.960- 20:40.680* :  What do people talk about when they don't drink?
*20:42.200- 20:44.020* :  I don't know, actually, it's the point.
*20:46.500- 20:46.880* :  Brexit?
*20:48.800- 20:54.360* :  We hear from one of the petrolhead trio who have dominated car shows for the past two decades.
*21:01.720- 21:08.260* :  This season, Instacart has your back to school. As in, they've got your back to school lunch
*21:08.260- 21:12.800* :  favourites like snack packs and fresh fruit, and they've got your back to school supplies,
*21:12.800- 21:20.060* :  like backpacks, binders, and pencils. And they've got your back when your kid casually tells you
*21:20.060- 21:25.900* :  they have a huge school project to do tomorrow. Let's face it, we were all that kid.
*21:26.580- 21:32.700* :  So, first, call your parents to say I'm sorry, and then download the Instacart app to get
*21:32.700- 21:38.900* :  delivery in as fast as 30 minutes all school year long. Get a $0 delivery fee with your first

*22:19.480- 22:24.040* :  You're listening to the Global News podcast. Now, it may surprise you to hear that China has
*22:24.040- 22:29.560* :  one of the world's lowest retirement ages for a major economy, especially if you're a woman.
*22:29.560- 22:37.100* :  Currently, some women can retire at 50, the rest at 55, and men can retire at 60. But in a country
*22:37.100- 22:42.760* :  where the birth rate has plummeted in large part because of Beijing's draconian one child policy,
*22:42.760- 22:47.760* :  and where life expectancy has risen substantially as China has become wealthier,
*22:48.180- 22:52.340* :  the government is now looking at following the example of countries like France in raising the
*22:52.340- 22:58.800* :  retirement age to 63 for men and up to 58 for women. Our age at Pacific editor, Michebristo,
*22:58.800- 23:05.380* :  told us more. The retirement age is going to increase mostly by three years from 60 to 63 for
*23:05.380- 23:12.760* :  men. The white collar women, 55 to 58 for women involved in manual labor. The age is going to go up
*23:12.760- 23:19.460* :  a little bit more from 50 to 55. It's going to be introduced starting next year over 15 years,
*23:19.460- 23:24.740* :  so gradual introduction. Essentially, the reason China is doing this is because of the massive
*23:25.380- 23:31.260* :  democratic shift, which is taking place in the country. Fewer babies, that means fewer working
*23:31.260- 23:39.280* :  people in the next decade or so in the few decades ahead, pain less taxes, and also an age in
*23:39.280- 23:44.600* :  population. It's estimated that in about a decade's time, there are going to be 400 million people
*23:44.600- 23:49.700* :  in China over 60. If this change hadn't have come in, then all of those people would have been
*23:49.700- 23:54.620* :  able to claim retirement benefits. What have people been saying about this plan to raise a
*23:54.620- 23:59.540* :  retirement age? Well, all across the world, if you give people the option to retire earlier,
*23:59.540- 24:04.980* :  or later, then most people are going to choose earlier. That's certainly some of the responses
*24:04.980- 24:10.700* :  that we've had in China. But also, there's a recognition, I think, in China that the demographics
*24:10.700- 24:16.700* :  have changed, and the countries facing a more complex economic situation, then it has been in
*24:16.700- 24:23.800* :  the past. This is what a few people in Beijing had to say about that. My first reaction is,
*24:24.180- 24:29.320* :  so when can I get my pension? My biggest concern is not retirement, but rather the fact I'm about
*24:29.320- 24:37.720* :  to turn 35 and will face a difficult employment situation. I may feel a bit reluctant to work
*24:37.720- 24:43.120* :  for such a long time, but I also understand this decision. The government may have to consider
*24:43.120- 24:48.780* :  the issue of an aging population. This being China, the government's going to control the narrative,
*24:48.780- 24:53.300* :  already some online comments have been censored. There are probably not going to be the protests
*24:53.300- 24:58.880* :  that we saw in France, the raising of retirement age, we saw last year, simply Chinese people
*24:58.880- 25:05.460* :  are just going to accept these changes handy down to them. Mickey Bristol. Well, not only
*25:05.460- 25:10.600* :  is the world population getting older, it's getting fatter. Around the world, more and more people
*25:10.600- 25:16.120* :  are becoming obese, making them more likely to suffer serious health issues. Now, the British
*25:16.120- 25:20.920* :  government, two months after it was elected, has announced that from next year, all online
*25:20.920- 25:26.840* :  adverts for food that is high in fat, sugar or salt will be banned. Junk food TV adverts will
*25:26.840- 25:31.560* :  also be blocked at times when children are likely to be watching. Ministers say it's part of a
*25:31.560- 25:37.300* :  campaign to lower child obesity and reduce pressure on the National Health Service. The British
*25:37.300- 25:43.140* :  broadcaster and chef Hugh Fernley Woodenstall told us that more needed to be done. We can't really
*25:43.140- 25:49.380* :  have a coherent conversation about the future of the NHS, unless tackling obesity is at the heart
*25:49.380- 25:55.540* :  of it, because the single biggest cause of preventable illness, of early death, and it's the
*25:55.540- 26:02.360* :  single biggest expense of any disease and living with obesity is a disease for the NHS. So this
*26:02.360- 26:08.100* :  is just one step among many that need to be taken, but it's extremely welcome. Well, our business
*26:08.100- 26:14.220* :  correspondent, Mariko Oy, told us more. Obesity is a big problem, especially among young children,
*26:14.220- 26:19.760* :  and that's what the government wants to tackle. So according to the health minister, more than one
*26:19.760- 26:24.420* :  in five children in England are currently overweight or obese by the time they start primary school,
*26:24.820- 26:30.120* :  and that figure goes up to one third by the time they leave primary school. So in order to tackle
*26:30.120- 26:36.040* :  this, the government has announced or rather confirmed that this new rules will kick in next
*26:36.040- 26:43.880* :  October. So any junk food adverts will be banned on TV before 9 p.m. or after 5.30 a.m. So that's
*26:43.880- 26:50.300* :  basically when children are likely to be watching, and also all the paid for online adverts will
*26:50.300- 26:56.200* :  also be totally banned. So it's something that the previous administration has floated as well,
*26:56.200- 27:01.160* :  but it didn't get executed in this time around. The government has confirmed that it is definitely
*27:01.160- 27:07.080* :  going to start next October. And obesity is a problem, not just for the UK, but for many, many other
*27:07.080- 27:13.680* :  countries. What are other countries doing to tackle this growing issue? Yeah, I was looking up,
*27:13.680- 27:18.760* :  but which other countries may actually treat junk food? I guess in the same category as sexual
*27:18.760- 27:24.620* :  content or swearing. Australia has been, you know, there are rights groups saying that this is
*27:24.620- 27:29.220* :  something that they should consider, but it doesn't look like many other governments has actually
*27:29.220- 27:35.160* :  done this. And in a way I grew up in Japan, you can see junk food ads throughout the day,
*27:35.160- 27:40.420* :  and there's no rules or regulations. I mean, of course, the BCD issue is less of a problem
*27:40.420- 27:46.060* :  here in Asia, but it is a very, I guess, significant and, you know, different approach by the UK
*27:46.060- 27:51.000* :  government this time. That's interesting, isn't it? Because I don't think Japan has anywhere near
*27:51.000- 27:55.580* :  the obesity problem that the UK does. So it does seem to indicate, perhaps, that there are other
*27:55.580- 28:00.500* :  issues that need to be tackled, and that's what health campaigners would say. Yeah, because I think
*28:00.500- 28:06.720* :  it's one thing to just not show it on TV at certain times, but in this day and age, children could
*28:06.720- 28:12.340* :  be watching it online or, you know, streaming, and they're probably watching it on their devices
*28:12.340- 28:17.460* :  in their room. So it's not obviously the only thing that they can do, and there are other things
*28:17.460- 28:24.300* :  like obviously education. All those measures also need to be addressed. Marie Kauoi. North Korea has
*28:24.300- 28:29.380* :  for the first time released photographs showing the machines used to make fuel for its nuclear bombs.
*28:29.740- 28:34.760* :  The images show North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-Un, visiting a uranium enrichment facility.
*28:34.760- 28:41.540* :  Jim McKenzie reports. Just earlier this week, Mr Kim set his country was on course to exponentially
*28:41.540- 28:47.720* :  increase its stash of nuclear weapons. It's not known how many nuclear weapons North Korea has,
*28:47.720- 28:53.080* :  but one recent estimate puts a number at 50, with enough material for another 40.
*28:53.760- 28:58.800* :  This is the first time North Korea has published photos of one of its uranium enrichment facilities.
*28:59.600- 29:04.780* :  Pyongyang may well be doing this to try and put pressure on the US ahead of its presidential
*29:04.780- 29:12.060* :  election. Jim McKenzie. Scientists have solved the mystery of what made a seismic signal reverberate
*29:12.060- 29:17.680* :  around the Earth for nine days last September. A global team of researchers say a massive landslide
*29:17.680- 29:22.700* :  caused a tsunami in a remote field in Greenland. Here's our science correspondent Victoria Gill.
*29:23.260- 29:28.260* :  When seismic sensors around the planet picked up the unusual signal emanating from Greenland,
*29:28.260- 29:33.400* :  a group of geologists set out to solve the mystery of what was causing it. They eventually worked out
*29:33.400- 29:39.240* :  that this vibration that lasted an unprecedented nine days came from a massive landslide that triggered
*29:39.240- 29:44.380* :  a tsunami in a remote field in the east of the country. Before and after images revealed that
*29:44.380- 29:49.720* :  a whole mountain top had collapsed there, sending a volume of rock equivalent to 25 Empire
*29:49.720- 29:55.780* :  state buildings slamming into the water. The depth and narrow shape of this 124 mile long
*29:55.900- 30:02.220* :  in effect trapped the wave so it sloshed back and forth creating the vibrations. Scientists say
*30:02.220- 30:06.600* :  the landslide was caused by rising temperatures in Greenland melting the glacier but was supporting
*30:06.600- 30:11.220* :  this mountain. As temperatures in the Arctic rise the risk of these landslides is increasing
*30:11.220- 30:17.840* :  a destructive side effect of climate change. Victoria Gill. Finally it's a big finale, the end of
*30:17.840- 30:23.100* :  an era for petrolheads. After 22 years the three presenters who first worked together on the
*30:23.100- 30:27.520* :  hugely successful top gear and then on the Grand Tour have reached the end of the road.
*30:28.000- 30:32.960* :  Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May are releasing their last episode of the Grand Tour
*30:32.960- 30:39.840* :  today. Over the years there have been high speed stunts, explosions, crashes, smashes but at the heart
*30:39.840- 30:45.600* :  of it all there's been a relationship between three men. What do people talk about when they don't
*30:45.600- 30:54.780* :  drink? Oh I don't know actually it's good point. Brexit. We've worked together now for many years
*30:55.920- 30:59.720* :  but we've never struggled to think of anything to say before but I think that's partly because
*30:59.720- 31:03.620* :  we can never remember what we said last time so we just do it again. Yeah that's a fact.
*31:04.860- 31:10.440* :  Well James May one of the presenters of the Grand Tour told us why the episode entitled One for
*31:10.440- 31:16.420* :  the Road will be the last. We are getting on a bit and everything does have to end and I think to
*31:16.420- 31:21.380* :  be honest well two things we wanted to end it on our own terms as we always used to say we want
*31:21.380- 31:27.620* :  to land it safely not fly it into a cliff and I think we've largely exhausted our take on the subject.
*31:27.620- 31:33.160* :  Not the subject itself there's space I think for a new approach to it but it can't come from us
*31:33.200- 31:37.160* :  we're a bit too stuck in our way of doing it. But is the subject cars or is the subject
*31:37.160- 31:42.400* :  a friendship between three men? I sometimes wonder if it is friendship we wind each other up so badly
*31:42.400- 31:47.760* :  but I mean it definitely started off as cars and it's rooted in our enthusiasm for them and even
*31:47.760- 31:53.740* :  dare I say it our knowledge of them but it is also about yes it's about human relationships and
*31:53.740- 31:58.900* :  without wishing to sound too pretentious. Also the human condition it's a view of what life means
*31:58.900- 32:04.820* :  through well from the perspective of people who are a bit overly obsessed about cars and of course
*32:04.820- 32:10.920* :  it also turned into a travel show a pantomime a circus all these other things as well and lots of
*32:10.920- 32:17.380* :  crashes and stuff along the way as we were hearing but in this kind of grand finale I mean certainly
*32:17.380- 32:24.920* :  from the tone of that clip what a more relaxed approach. Yes we decided before we set off that as
*32:25.060- 32:30.500* :  we knew as the last one we'd managed to decide that for ourselves before we were formally cancelled
*32:30.540- 32:37.240* :  that we would take a more relaxed approach to it and a more I suppose in a way a more a more real
*32:38.040- 32:43.640* :  and yes a more gentle approach that we chose cars that we'd like as kids and that we knew we were
*32:43.640- 32:47.380* :  on the last one and we would you know it would be slightly malancholic, slightly reflective
*32:48.140- 32:53.680* :  and that informs the whole show I think. Will you miss the others working with the others or being
*32:53.680- 32:59.900* :  with the others? What's your relationship like? Yes I did say somewhere else reason it will be hard
*32:59.900- 33:05.880* :  to settle down to two modest holidays a year after a 22 years of global adventuring and I
*33:06.240- 33:11.000* :  I will miss it but I'm glad we've brought it to a satisfactory conclusion. I'm noting that's not
*33:11.000- 33:15.400* :  a answer to whether you'll miss the other two. Well I don't think it's the last I've seen of them
*33:15.680- 33:21.280* :  to be brutally honest I think there is now no escape I mean this job has occupied over a third of
*33:21.280- 33:26.140* :  my life and the longest I managed to hold down any other job in my life was about a year and a half
*33:26.140- 33:32.320* :  so you know I think the subject of cars everything about them the cars themselves how we use them
*33:32.320- 33:39.260* :  what they represent has never been more interesting but it needs a reformatting and a rethinking of
*33:39.260- 33:46.020* :  the car show which you know as you've observed I was hardly was anymore and it would need younger
*33:46.020- 33:52.020* :  people I think people currently are known to come and re-address the subject and find the new way
*33:52.020- 33:56.880* :  of thinking about it and articulating what it is that a younger generation thinks about it
*33:57.420- 34:03.340* :  that was James May talking to Justin Webb and Michelle Hussein the grand tour one for the road is
*34:03.340- 34:10.540* :  available to watch on Amazon and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of
