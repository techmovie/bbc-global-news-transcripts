*02:02.700- 02:08.120* :  The confirmed deaths of another six of the hostages taken from Israel last October by Hamas
*02:08.420- 02:13.040* :  has led to Israelis taking to the streets in recent days. They're calling for a ceasefire in
*02:13.040- 02:19.080* :  Gaza and criticizing their Prime Minister loudly. We're protesting against the government
*02:19.500- 02:23.580* :  to never give us a chance to rescue our beloved ones.
*02:25.360- 02:29.120* :  Overseas, even close allies of Israel like the US President,
*02:29.120- 02:35.620* :  are ever more bluntly accusing Benjamin Netanyahu of not doing enough to secure a hostage deal.
*02:36.340- 02:41.480* :  So far, Israel's Prime Minister appears not to be listening to any criticism coming his way.
*02:41.740- 02:47.020* :  Now the world will seriously demand an Israel-made concession after this massacre.
*02:47.680- 02:51.700* :  What messages is this sent to Hamas? Murder more hostages, you'll get more concessions.
*02:52.220- 02:58.100* :  So will anything, can anything ever change Benjamin Netanyahu's mind and his plans to keep
*02:58.100- 03:01.600* :  fighting in Gaza, he says, until Hamas is wiped out.
*03:05.940- 03:09.320* :  With me today is the BBC's International Editor, Jeremy Bowen,
*03:09.900- 03:14.140* :  and I wanted to ask you, Jeremy, I mean, you've been covering the Middle East for years.
*03:14.400- 03:19.420* :  I've been out there for quite a few years myself and have spoken to Benjamin Netanyahu,
*03:19.420- 03:24.940* :  the Israeli Premier a few times, but you have really been able to watch him so much over his very
*03:24.940- 03:30.680* :  long political career. Tell us about, you know, who is he? When we talk about Will Benjamin Netanyahu
*03:30.680- 03:35.680* :  listen to X, Y or Z, how likely is he to do that? What kind of political animal is he?
*03:35.960- 03:40.220* :  Well, he's a political animal who's incredibly good at politics, he's incredibly good at staying
*03:40.220- 03:45.520* :  in power. With the exception of a fairly brief period of months, he's been Israeli Prime Minister
*03:45.520- 03:51.120* :  I think about the last 15 years. I used to watch him on TV when he was the ambassador at the United
*03:51.120- 03:58.580* :  Nations, very, very articulate spokesman for Israel. Much of his childhood was spent in the United
*03:58.580- 04:05.960* :  States, which was why he speaks English with such American fluency. When I was based in the
*04:05.960- 04:13.160* :  1990s in Jerusalem, Netanyahu became Prime Minister for the first time in 1996 and it was
*04:13.860- 04:17.980* :  an election which many Israelis old enough to remember it would say, well, everyone went to bed
*04:17.980- 04:22.560* :  thinking it was going to be Shimon Paris, who'd won, but then a few more votes came in and very
*04:22.560- 04:29.640* :  narrowly, Benjamin Netanyahu became the Prime Minister and it was the time of the Oslo peace process,
*04:30.400- 04:34.880* :  which he was vehemently opposed to. And while he went along with a lot of American pressure,
*04:35.660- 04:43.660* :  he was always deeply, instinctively against it. And now, many years later, and in the throws of
*04:43.660- 04:48.940* :  the most violent episode in the modern history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
*04:48.940- 04:54.960* :  any pretence that he had any desire to go in the direction of a two-state solution, a Palestinian
*04:54.960- 05:02.840* :  state alongside Israel has gone. He's vehemently said, no chance. How much is this an ideological
*05:02.860- 05:07.900* :  politician? We're talking about an ideological leader and how much, at the end of the day,
*05:07.900- 05:13.100* :  a pragmatist and survivor, and what's he surviving against if you can give us a quick picture?
*05:13.720- 05:18.860* :  Well, there is always this debate about the degree to which Netanyahu is an ideological man and
*05:18.860- 05:24.360* :  the degree to which he's a political man. He is definitely highly political, but I think that
*05:24.360- 05:30.500* :  is underpinned by ideology much of which he would have got from his father, who was something of a
*05:30.500- 05:37.020* :  controversial academic, but one very anchored in the hard right of Israeli politics.
*05:38.020- 05:44.360* :  Okay, well, let's have a look at the pressures that Benjamin Netanyahu is under. Obviously,
*05:44.360- 05:51.040* :  there was that Hamas organized attack inside Israel, unprecedented in scale and bloodiness,
*05:51.040- 05:56.280* :  largest loss of life inside Israel. Since the founding of the State of Israel almost a year ago now,
*05:56.600- 06:03.000* :  the retribution, the military activity of Israel's inside Gaza has been devastating ever since,
*06:03.000- 06:09.300* :  with Benjamin Netanyahu's aim, he says, that he wants to destroy Hamas, which, you know,
*06:09.300- 06:15.040* :  governs Gaza and is labelled a terrorist organization by the West. What about his people, though?
*06:15.280- 06:17.640* :  I mean, we've seen a general strike this week.
*06:17.740- 06:29.180* :  Israel is on the street saying, we want a ceasefire, the priority has to be getting our hostages
*06:29.180- 06:35.580* :  home. It doesn't look like Benjamin Netanyahu is moved by this. Israel is a very divided country
*06:38.420- 06:42.640* :  and the people who are going out on the streets, particularly of Tel Aviv and other places,
*06:42.640- 06:49.600* :  are very often secular, quite middle class, the kind of people who instinctively would not vote
*06:50.120- 06:57.020* :  for Netanyahu. He has drawn his support over many, many years, fundamentally from those people
*06:57.020- 07:02.080* :  who are on the right of Israeli politics and when we talk about right and left in Israel, it's not
*07:02.080- 07:07.140* :  about where you stand on the control of the economy or anything like that. The more right wing
*07:07.140- 07:13.040* :  Israelis are, the fewer concessions they're prepared to give to Palestinian self-determination,
*07:13.680- 07:19.080* :  vice versa, on the left. Traditionally, there were so-called lefty Israelis who were prepared to go
*07:19.080- 07:22.800* :  down that road of the two-state solution and with all the events that have been going on,
*07:22.800- 07:29.800* :  that's an increasingly small group of people. He's, I think, become very good at riding out a storm.
*07:29.800- 07:36.160* :  He's someone who, one of his essential political tools, is playing for time, waiting for something
*07:36.160- 07:42.120* :  better to turn up. He uses words in a very clever way, sometimes with very different messages in
*07:42.120- 07:47.620* :  Hebrew to the ones he sends out to the world in English and he's become quite a past master at
*07:47.640- 07:53.640* :  that. If you think the position he was in after the 7th of October attacks, when he was widely
*07:53.640- 08:03.060* :  blamed for a series of gross security errors that led to Hamas having an opportunity and not least
*08:03.360- 08:09.460* :  in allowing Hamas to be built up at the expense of the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank,
*08:09.460- 08:15.140* :  who is a group who are prepared to work with Israel who'd recognized Israel's existence, but
*08:15.740- 08:22.340* :  he believed in divide and rule. He felt that they could continue to control Gaza and it turned out
*08:22.340- 08:29.080* :  that was not the case and he is still very adeptly stepping aside from any admissions or
*08:29.080- 08:33.520* :  responsibility on that, but one thing he does know is that when he stops being Prime Minister,
*08:33.520- 08:38.020* :  he will have to face the music. That's right. And so there are allegations. We heard that from
*08:38.020- 08:42.940* :  this crowd, which was largely organized by the biggest trade union in Israel. And this is not a new
*08:42.940- 08:50.940* :  accusation that Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing his best to try and find a ceasefire with Hamas
*08:51.180- 08:58.100* :  because as long as there's conflict in Gaza, he's not facing the music. Also the judicial music
*08:58.100- 09:02.960* :  that he might end up facing. That's the accusation. Yeah, because he's also been on trial over
*09:02.960- 09:07.880* :  a period of years and that's now been put on hold because of the war for really serious corruption
*09:07.880- 09:13.580* :  charges that could end in a jail sentence. Benny Gantz, prominent opposition politician who did
*09:13.580- 09:19.780* :  join his war cabinet for a while after October 7th, he said the other day hostages must be returned
*09:19.780- 09:26.500* :  even at a heavy price. Netanyahu Gantz said his dealing with political survival and harming strategic
*09:26.500- 09:31.700* :  relations with the United States and that message is something that also comes from those
*09:31.700- 09:38.200* :  demonstrators. But on the other side, and these are the people who Netanyahu is keeping very close,
*09:39.000- 09:48.420* :  are the leaders of the extreme ultra-nationalist settler right in Israel. And he has a political
*09:48.420- 09:55.060* :  alliance with them, which delivered him a parliamentary majority. And the leaders of those groups
*09:55.060- 10:01.580* :  there are two gentlemen, they're both cabinet ministers, Iitema Ben-Govir and Betzelal Smotrich.
*10:02.220- 10:08.780* :  Ben-Govir wrote on X regarding the current negotiations about a ceasefire because of course those
*10:08.780- 10:16.840* :  hostages were found dead killed by Hamas in Gaza and that's the Israeli judgment on what happened.
*10:16.840- 10:22.040* :  A country that has Ben-Govir wrote on X, a country that has six of its hostages murdered and
*10:22.040- 10:27.040* :  called blood, doesn't hold negotiations with the murderers, but it stops the negotiations,
*10:27.100- 10:33.280* :  stops giving them fuel electricity, crushes them until they defeat. So while there are people
*10:33.280- 10:39.280* :  on the streets, what matters to Netanyahu is that there are people in the government who continue
*10:39.280- 10:45.900* :  to support him and keeping him office and Ben-Govir and his associate and sometime rival Smotrich
*10:46.420- 10:52.560* :  have both said that if he goes down the road of making deals that they believe are surrender,
*10:52.560- 10:57.700* :  they will topple his government and Netanyahu is clear once to stay in power.
*10:58.100- 11:04.840* :  Of course, so to summarize, he has political pressure from the extreme right in Israeli politics,
*11:05.480- 11:11.120* :  so he prefers to listen to them than the people on the streets. But how divided are the people
*11:11.300- 11:18.640* :  of Israel, Jeremy? Could it get to a point where those angry with Netanyahu demanding a change
*11:18.640- 11:24.200* :  in his military policy right now in Gaza at least for a temporary ceasefire to get the hostages out?
*11:24.200- 11:29.920* :  They could topple him as well? Well, they could only topple him with parliamentary support and
*11:29.920- 11:35.280* :  the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, is actually on an extended summer recess until just about a
*11:35.280- 11:41.560* :  week before the U.S. elections. There are signs that Netanyahu is trying to just keep things going
*11:41.560- 11:45.860* :  until the U.S. elections were and I think, of course, we'll be hoping that Donald Trump wins
*11:46.140- 11:48.920* :  and Donald Trump was very friendly to him in his last administration.
*11:49.640- 11:54.140* :  Well, thank you very much. It's an honor to have Prime Minister Netanyahu, a great friend of mine
*11:54.140- 11:59.660* :  and a great friend of our country. We've had a tremendous almost three-year relationship.
*11:59.660- 12:04.700* :  I've known you for many years before that, but this was three years of prime time and we've
*12:04.700- 12:11.560* :  done a lot for Israel. The latest poll by the public broadcaster can shows a majority of Israelis
*12:11.560- 12:19.560* :  do want that hostage deal, but it's not overwhelming. 53% support was drawn from the Philadelphia
*12:19.560- 12:26.240* :  corridor, which is the strip of land between the southern part of Gaza and Egypt, which is becoming
*12:26.240- 12:33.600* :  one of the big sticking points in the negotiation. In a hostage deal, 29%, believe Israel
*12:33.600- 12:40.060* :  should stay in that corridor, even if it means no hostage deal. And about 50%, I have no confidence
*12:40.060- 12:45.880* :  in the Prime Minister Netanyahu as a war leader. So that shows, I think, more than anything,
*12:46.620- 12:51.940* :  there are huge divisions in the country, political divisions, cultural divisions as well,
*12:51.940- 12:58.460* :  divisions about lifestyle, divisions about the obligations that Israeli citizens owe to their
*12:58.460- 13:04.180* :  country about who, for example, should do military service at the moment. The ultra-orthodox
*13:04.180- 13:11.380* :  community don't really have to do it. And people in the secular community who bearing the brunt
*13:11.560- 13:15.560* :  of all the reserved duty they've had to do are saying, well, hang on a minute, that's not fair.
*13:16.300- 13:20.700* :  All these things, there are loads of issues which cleave the country right into. And I think the
*13:20.700- 13:27.780* :  future of Netanyahu and the possible ceasefire and what the heck happens after there's a ceasefire.
*13:28.260- 13:34.380* :  Those are very, very divisive issues. So Israel divided, but not enough for Netanyahu to feel
*13:34.380- 13:40.440* :  unbearable heat. He's not going to just say, I've had enough, I'm going out the door. That's
*13:41.100- 13:47.620* :  against everything that he's ever stood for in his entire career. But the way it works is that he
*13:47.620- 13:51.940* :  has to lose a vote of confidence in the parliament. The parliament's not even going to reassemble
*13:51.940- 13:58.420* :  until the end of October. So he's got a breathing space here. His political foundations right now are
*13:58.420- 14:06.040* :  looking pretty stable despite those demos on the streets. Right, so that's a situation inside
*14:06.040- 14:14.000* :  Israel. What about close allies outside Israel? Number one, of course, the United States. How
*14:14.000- 14:18.080* :  effective can there would be on Israel's premiere?

*15:48.280- 15:55.040* :  Follow or subscribe wherever you listen. With me is the BBC's international editor Jeremy Bowen.
*15:56.020- 16:02.920* :  What about the international pressure? Because allies of Israel are clearly disturbed by the death
*16:02.920- 16:10.940* :  toll in Gaza, you know, 41,000 and more increasing. So on Monday we heard US President Joe Biden saying
*16:11.500- 16:15.100* :  he didn't think that Mr. Netanyahu was doing enough to reach a deal.
*16:16.580- 16:22.340* :  Mr. President, if you think it's time for Prime Minister Netanyahu to do more on this issue,
*16:22.340- 16:28.560* :  do you think he's doing enough? No. And Kamala Harris since becoming the Democratic presidential
*16:28.560- 16:35.540* :  nominee has told Mr. Netanyahu it is time to end the conflict. I also expressed with the Prime
*16:35.540- 16:43.440* :  Minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far
*16:43.440- 16:52.020* :  too many innocent civilians. How at the end of its tether is the US with all this? Does it have a
*16:52.020- 16:58.020* :  tether when it comes to Israel? I don't think Joe Biden does. I think he's regretful and probably
*16:58.020- 17:06.000* :  resentful about the way that Netanyahu is not doing as he's told. But if you think back to just
*17:06.000- 17:14.940* :  a couple of weeks after the October 7th attacks, Biden flew in to Israel. He put his arms around
*17:14.940- 17:19.260* :  Benjamin Netanyahu, a man with whom he has not gone on well over the years. He's known him for
*17:19.260- 17:27.300* :  very long time and he offered Israel emotional, political, military, diplomatic support. But what he
*17:27.300- 17:35.940* :  also said was do not get blinded by fury and anger and the desire for vengeance as we in the US
*17:36.580- 17:42.500* :  were blinded after 9-11. You have a right to defend yourself but you have to do it in the correct
*17:43.740- 17:50.960* :  way. But the point is that Netanyahu basically didn't listen because, and I think this is critical,
*17:51.180- 17:58.180* :  the US does potentially have levers which are more powerful than words and the best two levers are
*17:58.180- 18:06.760* :  diplomatic support and military supplies. And with the exception of one or two fairly token delays,
*18:07.800- 18:15.480* :  the Americans have continued to funnel in loads and loads of flights of heavy lift aircraft
*18:15.480- 18:22.040* :  bringing in the weapons and the ammunition that Israel needs. And I think that while Joe Biden
*18:22.040- 18:27.760* :  continues to be critical of Israel but then continues to give them all the military supplies
*18:27.760- 18:33.320* :  that they need, it renders what he says hollow. I mean action speak louder than words as you say.
*18:33.320- 18:39.420* :  I wonder what you think that as we get closer to the US election, there are lots of voters
*18:39.900- 18:45.540* :  in the democratic camp who, according to polls, may choose to stay at home because of those
*18:45.540- 18:51.760* :  ongoing weapons deliveries, for example. Do you think the Democrats might be tempted to make
*18:51.760- 18:58.660* :  a bigger move to actually take action to warn Israel? Well, I somehow doubt it because Joe Biden
*18:58.660- 19:04.960* :  is still the president. He describes himself as an Irish Catholic Zionist. His attachment to Israel,
*19:04.960- 19:11.460* :  really Israel right or wrong, runs very, very deep. And so while there are things happening,
*19:11.460- 19:16.600* :  not least the massive death toll of civilians and guards and the humanitarian catastrophes come
*19:16.600- 19:20.520* :  on the Harris and others have called it while that goes on and they, you know, they,
*19:20.720- 19:25.620* :  deeply regret it and what's more than that, they also are very well aware of the potential
*19:25.620- 19:32.640* :  political consequences in the US electoral process. I don't see them changing their views on Israel
*19:32.640- 19:38.580* :  because being close to Israel and being the ultimate support and protector of Israel is deeply
*19:38.580- 19:47.200* :  embedded in the political DNA of not just most American politicians, but many, many American voters.
*19:47.680- 19:53.660* :  And if in the US we don't see action rather than words warning Benjamin Netanyahu, then
*19:54.540- 20:01.860* :  what impact can other smaller, less significant allies in terms of economic and military support
*20:01.980- 20:07.560* :  make on the situation and on changing Benjamin Netanyahu's military policy? I'm thinking about,
*20:08.020- 20:13.220* :  you know, European countries like Spain, Ireland and Norway joining others in recognizing
*20:13.220- 20:19.840* :  Palestinian statehood or the UK as it's done recently, suspending not many, frankly, arms
*20:20.380- 20:25.420* :  with Israel. Does he care about any of this? South Africa at the International Court of Justice
*20:25.900- 20:30.940* :  saying Israel's committing genocide in Gaza, does this make a drop in Benjamin Netanyahu's
*20:31.320- 20:40.280* :  sort of policy pond? He pushes back very, very hard against all of that. He was gaving the condemnatory
*20:40.280- 20:45.240* :  about Britain's decision to pause a couple of, well, a number of arms contracts,
*20:46.740- 20:53.640* :  aided as well and supported by crucial Western allies. He is absolutely condemned, the actions in
*20:53.640- 21:00.380* :  the international judicial system. He personally faces, along with Defense Minister Galanty,
*21:01.180- 21:07.560* :  faces a potential arrest warrant in the International Criminal Court. And Israel has been reported
*21:07.560- 21:14.200* :  to the International Court of Justice for alleged crimes of genocide. So there's a lot of international
*21:14.200- 21:20.500* :  pressure building. Does it make a difference to him? No, I think Netanyahu quite likes the pressure
*21:20.500- 21:28.140* :  because he digs in. However, undoubtedly, it's politically difficult because Israel and his
*21:28.380- 21:33.760* :  critics inside Netanyahu's critics inside Israel make this point. They say Israel is getting more
*21:33.760- 21:39.400* :  and more isolated. And while it has a very strong relationship with the US, then perhaps it can
*21:39.400- 21:46.760* :  afford to be to a point, but equally, it's becoming a much more isolated country than it was
*21:48.620- 21:54.300* :  living memory of people who are probably in their 30s. I wonder if we could delve into a little
*21:54.300- 22:00.080* :  bit of history, Jeremy, because when it comes to pressure bearing down on Benjamin Netanyahu,
*22:00.920- 22:06.300* :  the one he most would care about is the powerful ally, the United States. But there have been
*22:06.300- 22:10.440* :  presidents over the years that have taken a tougher line against Israel, haven't they?
*22:11.140- 22:16.540* :  Absolutely. Harry Truman, who was president in 1948 when Israel declared independence, was a big
*22:16.540- 22:25.600* :  supporter. But then later on in the 1950s, the 1956 Suez War, Israel occupied the Sinai peninsula
*22:25.600- 22:32.340* :  and showed every sign of wanting to keep it from Egypt. And President Eisenhower told them to get
*22:32.340- 22:39.780* :  out. They had to pull back and they did. It was only really the 1967 war that made the Americans
*22:39.780- 22:46.940* :  think that Israel might become a very worthwhile military ally because of the nature of Israel's
*22:46.940- 22:55.720* :  crushing defeat of Syria and Egypt who were allied with the Soviet Union. So it was after 1967
*22:55.820- 23:03.080* :  that the Americans became the main supplier. But even back in the early 90s, there was pressure
*23:03.500- 23:12.420* :  from the U.S. on Israel. They were famously under the presidency of the first President George Bush.
*23:13.380- 23:19.520* :  Peace is vital here and we work too hard to have that request of mine denied.
*23:19.520- 23:24.520* :  You know, they put pressure on Israel. They also stop funding when they thought that funding
*23:24.520- 23:29.320* :  was going to be spent on settlements. And I'm up against some powerful political forces,
*23:29.320- 23:34.960* :  but I owe it to the American people to tell them how strongly I feel about deferral.
*23:35.140- 23:42.720* :  But in the years since then, and partly I think this is because of post 9-11, this feeling that
*23:42.720- 23:47.560* :  Israel was very much in the Western camp and the way the politics have evolved in the United
*23:47.560- 23:54.000* :  States. Now the U.S. absolutely routinely would use its veto at the Security Council to protect
*23:54.000- 24:04.460* :  Israel and they are much more Israel always in the right. One of the long-time peace negotiators
*24:04.960- 24:10.560* :  in the Oslo process famously, he said that looking back on the failures of his of the peace
*24:10.560- 24:15.680* :  negotiations, he said, you know, looking back on it, we were just too often, we were Israel's
*24:15.680- 24:21.940* :  attorney. We were their lawyer. We weren't really intermediaries in the way that we might have been.
*24:21.940- 24:28.820* :  We were essentially representing them. And I think that certainly continues. And if you speak to
*24:28.820- 24:34.740* :  any Palestinian I've spoken to, they'll say, well, hang on a minute, the West roundly condemns
*24:34.740- 24:43.200* :  Russia for what it does in Ukraine, yet they barely criticize what Israel does in Gaza and the
*24:43.200- 24:48.540* :  West Bank. And Palestinians would say, and you know, Israel would absolutely reject this and so
*24:48.540- 24:53.120* :  would its allies. Palestinians would say, what is the difference actually?
*24:54.300- 24:58.820* :  If we return to the question we were looking at right the beginning of this episode, can any
*24:58.820- 25:04.460* :  effective pressure be brought to bear on Benjamin Netanyahu to alter his military strategy
*25:04.460- 25:11.120* :  in Gaza and keep insisting he won't stop till Hamas is wiped out? If international pressure from
*25:11.120- 25:16.100* :  his allies isn't working and domestic pressure isn't working on him, ultimately does it come down
*25:16.100- 25:21.820* :  to Benjamin Netanyahu when he decides? Does it come back to that Jeremy that he'll get to
*25:21.820- 25:27.120* :  a point where it is no longer working for him and only then will he change? In a way, this whole
*25:27.120- 25:32.020* :  thing comes down to two men to Benjamin Netanyahu and to the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwa, who is,
*25:32.600- 25:38.620* :  we assume in some hiding place in Gaza, Israel's public enemy number one, the guy they want to kill
*25:38.680- 25:45.760* :  most. I think that what might bring an end to this war or the phase of this war will be if
*25:46.040- 25:54.640* :  Netanyahu can have a symbol of victory and the principal one would be the killing of Yahya Sinwa.
*25:54.640- 26:00.260* :  If they could kill him and say, look, we have now cut off the head of the snake. We've cut off the
*26:00.260- 26:06.600* :  heads of the replacement snakes as assistant commanders and so on. We can now say we can declare
*26:06.600- 26:13.440* :  victory. Other things as well might affect the calculations not just of Netanyahu but of his
*26:13.440- 26:21.380* :  Western allies and a principal one would be what if there is that much feared hot wider regional
*26:21.380- 26:26.980* :  war which the region has been teetering on the brink of repeatedly. There is a lower level
*26:27.440- 26:33.160* :  wider regional war but it could get so much worse that of as well would change calculations
*26:33.400- 26:39.480* :  greatly. So there are circumstances which will change things but I think at the moment it is
*26:39.480- 26:47.000* :  events like that rather than pressure that might change the calculations for Benjamin Netanyahu.
*26:47.860- 26:52.140* :  Over a very long political career he is the longest serving Israeli Prime Minister,
*26:52.140- 26:57.880* :  longer than Ben Gurion, the founding Prime Minister. He has shown that what he has more than anything
*26:57.880- 27:04.280* :  else is an incredible instinct for political survival. Do you feel that even though the US and
*27:04.280- 27:11.040* :  others have been unsuccessful in changing Netanyahu's military policy over Gaza they have had
*27:11.040- 27:16.120* :  success in recent times in staying his hands somewhat when it comes to action against Iran.
*27:16.120- 27:21.620* :  Even though there have been some audacious events if you like that this fear of the wider war
*27:21.620- 27:26.720* :  which would have a massive economic impact on the West never mind anything else is something
*27:26.720- 27:32.180* :  that is causing them to speak in much sharper tones to Mr Netanyahu behind closed doors.
*27:32.560- 27:37.440* :  Yeah there have been massive diplomatic efforts to try to calibrate Israel's response
*27:37.500- 27:44.020* :  to things that have been done to it which have been seemingly effective. I think the thing to
*27:44.020- 27:50.720* :  remember is that neither Iran and its friends nor the Israelis and their friends want to have
*27:50.720- 27:57.540* :  that regional war. They all recognize how potentially catastrophic it would be but at the same time
*27:57.540- 28:03.740* :  I do get the sense that Netanyahu is prepared at times to push the envelope and to do things
*28:04.580- 28:09.220* :  which is West and back as certainly would feel very uncomfortable about. I'm thinking perhaps
*28:09.220- 28:17.460* :  of the assassination of the Hamas political leader Ismail Hania that was something which Israel chose
*28:17.600- 28:22.880* :  to do. You know Netanyahu I think is a person who over the years has absolutely convinced himself
*28:23.020- 28:30.400* :  that he is actually vital to the security of Israel. He talks a lot about the protection of the
*28:30.400- 28:34.180* :  Jewish people and I think it's something he believes. I mean I don't think he's an entirely
*28:34.180- 28:39.400* :  cynical man at all he has deep beliefs about all of this and he believes that he's the man
*28:39.400- 28:45.480* :  who can protect the Israelis like no other who can juggle their allies who can get them where
*28:45.480- 28:51.260* :  they need to be who can be tough when necessary who can make sure that the money is coming in to
*28:51.600- 28:57.200* :  and the external political support to back what Israel needs to do and at the same time he
*28:58.080- 29:05.040* :  fights political fires inside his own country but he's that person who in his own mind I think he
*29:05.040- 29:13.820* :  really believes that he can do this like nobody else. Thank you Jeremy. It's a pleasure.
