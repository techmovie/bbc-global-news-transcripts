*01:49.260- 01:54.400* :  When the Titan Submersible was reported missing on its expedition to the Titanic last year,
*01:54.460- 01:59.640* :  the eyes of the world became fixed on the recovery mission. But as the prospect of a rescue
*01:59.640- 02:05.580* :  began to wane, authorities concluded the vessel had suffered a catastrophic implosion.
*02:06.020- 02:11.200* :  Eventually, we learnt all five on board died instantly. It was a tragedy and for the past two
*02:11.200- 02:16.600* :  weeks, the US Coast Guard has been hearing from numerous witnesses to try to piece together what
*02:16.600- 02:21.100* :  went wrong. On this episode, we're sifting through the most revealing testimonies.
*02:21.460- 02:25.500* :  Why did Oceangate staff have concerns? Was the fatal mission avoidable?
*02:26.020- 02:31.200* :  And what could the Titans demise mean for the future of deep sea exploration?
*02:38.240- 02:42.880* :  With me today's the BBC's science editor Rebecca Morrell, who not only has been following
*02:42.880- 02:49.280* :  every second of the proceedings, but has also been reporting on her passion, the deep sea for years.
*02:50.340- 02:54.640* :  Rebecca, hi. Thanks for joining. Hello. We're going to get into the detail of what happened
*02:54.640- 02:59.560* :  shortly, but first off, let's just clear something up. Rebecca, what exactly do we mean when we
*02:59.560- 03:03.540* :  talk about a submersible? That's a good question because it's this word we've been hearing
*03:03.540- 03:08.700* :  every day, all day, for the last few weeks during the public hearing. So basically, there are
*03:08.700- 03:15.400* :  different kinds of underwater vehicles. You can have remotely operated vehicles. There are OVs
*03:15.400- 03:20.240* :  and they're basically underwater robots. There's no one inside of them. You can have submarines.
*03:20.380- 03:25.380* :  These are kind of the bigger crafts that you think of that, you know, maybe the military use.
*03:25.380- 03:31.060* :  And the difference with them is that they can move under their own power. They don't have to be
*03:31.060- 03:36.480* :  sort of brought to and from their dive spot. As a submersible, they're generally smaller. They
*03:36.480- 03:41.440* :  need to be carried to the place where they're going to do their dive by a ship. They have a
*03:41.440- 03:46.340* :  support ship. And in terms of their own power, they have batteries that might need to be replaced
*03:46.340- 03:50.260* :  or recharged. So it's a subtle difference, but it's good to know what submersible is.
*03:50.540- 03:54.300* :  While digging into that, in this case, we're talking about the Titan submersible, which was
*03:54.300- 04:00.280* :  supposed to be heading to the wreckage of the Titanic, which is 3,800 meters below sea level.
*04:00.280- 04:06.780* :  That's about 12,500 feet. So could you tell us more specifically about that vessel and who was
*04:06.780- 04:15.100* :  on board? This was a submersible owned by a company called Ocean Gate. The idea behind it was
*04:15.260- 04:21.940* :  to take paying passengers down to see the Titanic, which is at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean,
*04:22.020- 04:28.940* :  you know, the world's most famous shipwreck. It had been operating dives there for a couple of
*04:28.940- 04:35.820* :  years before the accident, but in June 2023, the 18th of June, five people got on board the
*04:35.820- 04:41.760* :  submersible. They were Ocean Gate's CEO, Stockton Rush, Shazada Darwood, a British
*04:41.760- 04:47.400* :  Pakistani businessman, and he's 19-year-old son, Suleiman, Hamish Harding, a British explorer,
*04:47.400- 04:53.660* :  PH Najili, a Titanic expert. So it was a team of five of them getting inside the submersible.
*04:54.100- 05:00.520* :  They set off early in the morning, descended beneath the waves and messaged back and forth with
*05:00.520- 05:05.580* :  a support ship, but about an hour and a half into their journey contact was lost.
*05:06.520- 05:12.700* :  Live from London, this is BBC News. A huge search operation is underway after a tourist submarine
*05:12.700- 05:17.440* :  carrying five people to the wreck of the Titanic went missing in the North Atlantic.
*05:18.480- 05:25.020* :  This sparked an absolutely fast search and rescue operation because the US Coast Guard was
*05:25.280- 05:31.800* :  notified, and for days following the news that this submersible had gone missing, there was a
*05:31.840- 05:37.220* :  search happening by air, by sea, underwater robots were sent down to try and work out what was
*05:37.440- 05:43.900* :  going on. There were reports of underwater noises, so there was this idea that people might be in
*05:43.900- 05:50.660* :  the sub still alive, banging noises. Yeah, that's right. That's how it's reported, but a few days
*05:50.660- 05:55.420* :  after they'd gone missing, the news came in that the wreckage of the submersible had been found
*05:55.600- 06:00.480* :  and all five people had died on board, and it had actually happened an hour and a half into their
*06:00.760- 06:05.580* :  descent. I was in the US at the time, and it felt like everyone was holding their breath,
*06:05.580- 06:10.380* :  counting every minute until we had an answer to that key question, are there any survivors?
*06:10.800- 06:17.640* :  How many days are we talking about here? So the dive began on the 18th of June, when the submersible
*06:18.060- 06:23.200* :  didn't resurface at the time, it was expected to, people on the support ship phoned the US Coast Guard,
*06:23.920- 06:29.460* :  they started their major search and rescue operation the next day, that was the Monday, when
*06:29.460- 06:36.120* :  that really began, and on Thursday, so a few days after that, that was when the wreckage was
*06:36.120- 06:41.500* :  discovered, and it had indeed confirmed that all five people on board had died. This morning,
*06:42.380- 06:50.600* :  an ROV or remote operated vehicle from the vessel Horizon Artic discovered the tail cone
*06:51.100- 06:59.900* :  of the Titan submersible approximately 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic on the seafloor.
*07:00.180- 07:06.240* :  The search and rescue operation was unprecedented, really. I mean, the US Coast Guard is usually
*07:06.240- 07:13.800* :  used to looking for a lost ship, perhaps, or someone lost at sea, so trying to sort of work out how
*07:13.800- 07:19.940* :  to find a submersible that maybe had come to the surface, but was bobbing around, and you know,
*07:19.940- 07:24.540* :  no one knew where it was, or was at the bottom of the ocean with people in it, or, as it turned out,
*07:24.540- 07:29.220* :  had imploded, was very difficult, so people from all over the world, it was a massive search and
*07:29.220- 07:33.060* :  rescue operation, and also because of the nationalities of the people on board, you know, it's a mix of
*07:33.500- 07:39.260* :  British, French, US. It really was unprecedented. Yes, I remember our own teams in South Asia were
*07:39.260- 07:44.540* :  contacting relatives. It really was a global story at the time. We keep talking about a catastrophic
*07:44.540- 07:50.800* :  implosion. What does that mean exactly? At the bottom of the Atlantic ocean where the Titanic is
*07:50.800- 07:57.880* :  3,800 meters down, the pressure is absolutely immense. It's basically the weight of all the water
*07:58.320- 08:04.660* :  above you, pushing down on you, so any craft has to be able to basically withstand, resist that
*08:04.660- 08:11.860* :  pressure. So a catastrophic implosion happens when the submersible that is down at this sort of depth,
*08:11.860- 08:17.480* :  the hole, which is the area where the passengers are in, is somehow breached, and the pressure,
*08:17.480- 08:22.700* :  it basically crushes the vessel, but it happens incredibly quickly. It's instantaneous.
*08:23.380- 08:28.100* :  Now at the time you interviewed James Cameron, the award-winning director of the Titanic film,
*08:28.680- 08:34.120* :  he has actually completed more than 30 submersible dives to the Titanic wreck during development.
*08:35.020- 08:40.980* :  He was among many who called this preventable. I would submit that there's a terrible irony here.
*08:41.500- 08:47.780* :  Here we have at the wreck of Titanic, we now have another wreck that is based on unfortunately
*08:47.780- 08:53.160* :  the same principles of not heating warnings. And the US Coast Guard has spent the last two weeks
*08:53.160- 08:58.780* :  attempting to answer that key question, could this have been prevented? Yeah, that's right. I mean,
*08:58.780- 09:05.520* :  what emerged during the week that the Titanic submersible was missing and after the wreckage had
*09:05.520- 09:13.780* :  been found were just how many people within the deep sea community were really concerned about the
*09:13.780- 09:19.740* :  safety of the submersible that Ocean Gate had designed. There are two purposes behind the
*09:19.740- 09:24.240* :  investigation, and they've actually been investigating this for the last 15 months. So they've been
*09:24.240- 09:31.660* :  trying to work out what were the events leading up to the catastrophic implosion, and could anything
*09:31.660- 09:36.360* :  have been done, running up to that to have stopped it, and what lessons can be learned in the
*09:36.360- 09:41.460* :  future to prevent it from happening again? So as you've mentioned, one of those who tragically
*09:41.460- 09:46.980* :  died was the company's co-founder, Stockton Rush. But throughout these hearings, much of the scrutiny
*09:46.980- 09:55.200* :  has focused on decisions he made as CEO prior to that fatal voyage. What have we learned about him
*09:55.200- 10:02.820* :  and why he founded Ocean Gate? Well, he was an interesting character, his background was in
*10:02.900- 10:10.620* :  engineering and aviation. So in 2009 Stockton Rush founded the Ocean Gate Company. The idea
*10:10.620- 10:16.400* :  originally was to actually buy ready-made submersibles in and to take passengers down in them,
*10:16.440- 10:22.040* :  so basically to charter trips to paying customers. A few years after that, they had a slight change
*10:22.040- 10:26.380* :  of tax, so they did buy some submersibles, but then they decided that they wanted to build their
*10:26.380- 10:31.600* :  own submersible. Yes, that was Guillermo Sunlin, the co-founder of Ocean Gate who said that.
*10:31.600- 10:37.980* :  At the time, we had absolutely no intention of building our own subs. Now, what we did intend to do
*10:38.340- 10:44.900* :  was buy a used sub. Now, we ended up calling it our training wheel sub so that when we went to build
*10:44.900- 10:49.500* :  this fleet of four or five subs and deployed them around the world, we would know what we were
*10:49.500- 10:56.340* :  looking for. What's emerged about Stockton Rush during the hearings? I mean, he was a complicated
*10:56.400- 11:03.120* :  man by the sounds of it. I mean, he was warned repeatedly about the safety of his submersible by
*11:03.120- 11:10.180* :  many people. He wanted me to be a pilot that runs the Titanic missions, and I told him I'm not
*11:10.180- 11:14.740* :  getting in it because the operations crew, I don't trust him, but I didn't trust Stockton either.
*11:15.620- 11:22.000* :  He didn't listen to the safety concerns, and in fact, he was absolutely certain that the sub he
*11:22.000- 11:28.820* :  was building was safe. I mean, a transcript was actually released with him saying, no one is dying
*11:28.820- 11:34.880* :  on my watch. This was from 2018 during a key meeting where someone had brought up safety concerns,
*11:35.020- 11:41.800* :  and I think diving in it is one of the safest things I'll ever do. And despite his passion,
*11:41.800- 11:47.220* :  what do we know about how the company was performing financially? We know that the company was
*11:47.220- 11:54.060* :  strapped for cash. We heard evidence from Amber Bay, who was the Director of Administration
*11:54.240- 12:01.420* :  for the company, and she was talking about their sort of business model. So when the sub
*12:01.420- 12:08.120* :  first started operations, the company was marketing a seat at $150,000, and there wasn't actually
*12:08.120- 12:14.280* :  a seat, you'd actually sit on the floor in the submersible. The next year, that went up to $250,000,
*12:14.420- 12:19.200* :  but diving to the Titanic wasn't easy, so they had lots of attempts to get down there where
*12:19.200- 12:24.120* :  something went a bit wrong with the submersible and they came back up. So the idea was if a paying
*12:24.120- 12:28.580* :  passenger didn't get down to see the Titanic, they didn't get a refund, they were offered
*12:28.580- 12:35.460* :  another dive. But the problem is, every dive and every extra expedition costs money. So they
*12:35.460- 12:41.940* :  were funding the next set of dives with the deposits from future passengers who were going to go
*12:42.200- 12:47.480* :  down. I mean, she also spoke about how she and Stockton, Russia delayed getting their salary
*12:48.060- 12:54.400* :  for a month. I believe it was the beginning of 2023, where you're looking to make ends meet,
*12:54.400- 13:00.660* :  and there was an offer that Stockton had derived, I believe, with an attorney or whomever,
*13:01.120- 13:07.420* :  that we could delay our paychecks and be paid a small amount of interest and recaptured at a
*13:07.420- 13:12.840* :  specific time. It was quite a hand-to-mouth, I think, and some people who gave evidence at the
*13:13.240- 13:19.920* :  hearing also said that this shortage of cash was leading to safety shortcuts particularly,
*13:20.520- 13:26.220* :  when it came to checking this submersible carefully after a particular problem had been seen
*13:26.220- 13:33.800* :  during a dive. And when it came to safety regulations in particular, there was an issue around
*13:33.800- 13:39.780* :  certification, wasn't there? Yes, that's right. So the process of certification, which we've
*13:39.780- 13:46.440* :  been hearing a lot about during the hearing, this is basically an independent safety assessment
*13:46.440- 13:54.080* :  carried out by a third party specialist marine organisation. So their organisations like the
*13:54.080- 14:00.440* :  American Bureau of Shipping or the DMV, which is based in Norway or Lloyd's Register, which is
*14:00.440- 14:07.540* :  based in the UK, what happens is someone from one of these organisations follows the submersible
*14:08.300- 14:15.220* :  from design to construction to testing to operations to confirm that it conforms to certain
*14:16.140- 14:23.280* :  standards. Now, almost all deep-seated submersibles, and in fact all known deep-seated submersibles,
*14:24.020- 14:32.220* :  have been certified, but it isn't mandatory. And Stockton Rush, a Notiongate, opted not to have
*14:32.220- 14:37.240* :  the Titan certified. They talked about it at the beginning when it was in development, which was
*14:37.240- 14:40.840* :  very interesting. We didn't know that about before. They had been thinking about it, but it cost
*14:40.880- 14:46.800* :  money. And whether that was their motivation for not doing it, we can't hear from Stockton Rush
*14:46.800- 14:53.920* :  because he died in the disaster, but they chose not to do it. I mean, he said that he believed
*14:53.920- 15:00.580* :  that certification really sort of stimmed innovation. If you're not breaking things, you're not
*15:00.580- 15:04.560* :  innovating. To me, the more stuff you've broken, the more innovative you've been. And if you're
*15:04.560- 15:09.880* :  operating within a known environment as most submersible manufacturers do, they don't break things.
*15:10.140- 15:15.380* :  That was his argument. He said, what we're doing is too innovative for these organisations.
*15:15.500- 15:21.240* :  They want to hold us back, but deep-seated experts really vehemently disagree with that.
*15:21.240- 15:27.280* :  And basically, they say the more experimentalist submersible gets, the more it needs to be tested
*15:27.280- 15:32.380* :  by outside bodies to make sure that it's safe. And the problem that many have raised here
*15:32.800- 15:36.280* :  is the fact that there were tourists, essentially, passengers on board.
*15:36.960- 15:42.180* :  Yes, that's right. So it's a very interesting point because Oceangate did not call them
*15:42.180- 15:47.900* :  tourists or passengers or paying customers, which is basically what they work. So we're
*15:47.900- 15:53.340* :  paying money to go down in the submersible. They called them mission specialists. So you can look
*15:53.340- 16:00.620* :  at this two ways. You can look at it as a marketing tool to say to someone who's wealthy with a
*16:00.620- 16:04.720* :  lot of money. Look, you're not just buying for a place in the sub. You're going to get involved
*16:04.720- 16:10.280* :  with the expedition. You're going to be involved with checking over the submersible with life on board,
*16:10.280- 16:17.280* :  the ship. So it's a more experiential term. But other people have said actually the term
*16:17.280- 16:24.320* :  mission specialist by not classifying the crew as tourists or paying passengers. It helped
*16:24.320- 16:32.000* :  to circumvent some of the transport rules about what you can take people down in. So it was a
*16:32.000- 16:36.820* :  workaround. That's what they're saying. So we've reminded ourselves about the fatal implosion
*16:36.820- 16:42.220* :  of the Titan submersible and heard about the Maverick mastermind behind the company which developed it.
*16:42.540- 16:48.440* :  Next, we'll take a closer look at the red flag. Staff members say they raised before the Titan's demise.
*16:54.600- 16:58.360* :  Explaining football to the friend who's just there for the nachos? Hard.

*18:21.300- 18:26.600* :  We've heard how Stockton Rush might have been somewhat resistant to what he viewed as bureaucratic
*18:26.600- 18:32.200* :  red tape, but let's dig into some of the specific safety concerns that were raised about the
*18:32.200- 18:36.500* :  Titan. Now the design of the submersible itself has come under the spotlight during the hearing
*18:36.500- 18:43.100* :  hasn't it? Yeah that's right and before actually I mean it's a very unorthodox submersible.
*18:44.140- 18:50.880* :  There were plenty of concerns about its design from the basic stuff like its shape,
*18:50.940- 18:55.640* :  the shape of its hull. Now the hull is the bit of the submersible that the passengers go in.
*18:55.640- 19:03.180* :  It's the bit that resist the immense pressure at these sort of very very deep spots in the ocean,
*19:03.860- 19:09.220* :  but it was cylindrical. It wasn't spherical. Most subs are spherical because it means the effects
*19:09.340- 19:14.680* :  of that pressure have felt equally all around the structure of the hull. That wasn't the case
*19:14.680- 19:21.200* :  with this one. There were questions about the window in the submersible. The people who designed
*19:21.200- 19:28.920* :  the window we've been hearing would only rate it to 1,300 metres, but Titan was diving three times
*19:28.920- 19:35.720* :  deeper and we heard evidence with an engineer who had looked at the design of the window saying
*19:35.720- 19:40.860* :  actually the deep pressure would have shifted it slightly in its place in the sub.
*19:40.980- 19:46.960* :  It wasn't just acrylic windows, plastic materials creep, all materials creep, which means when
*19:46.960- 19:52.320* :  you're under pressure it deforms. The creep test is really important and part of it is if it's
*19:52.320- 19:57.480* :  under pressure does it keep moving. Metal doesn't do that, that acrylic does. One of the biggest
*19:57.480- 20:02.580* :  issues though is what the submersible was actually made of, what the hull was made of. Now most
*20:02.580- 20:08.860* :  deep sea subs are made of metals like titanium. They're very reliable under pressure, but they're
*20:08.860- 20:14.580* :  also expensive. Titanium is really expensive. It's really heavy, which kind of constrains the size
*20:14.580- 20:19.300* :  of the sub. You can't make a very big submersible to get lots of people in there. You can maybe build
*20:19.300- 20:25.480* :  one with a spot for one or two people. Stockton Rush used carbon fiber. It was actually a mix
*20:25.480- 20:31.920* :  of carbon fiber layers mixed with a resin. Now this is used in aviation. It's really good on planes.
*20:31.980- 20:38.320* :  It performs really well in those kind of situations. It's lightweight and it works well under tension,
*20:39.100- 20:46.840* :  but it is not a good material under pressure. It doesn't like being compressed. You get a thing called
*20:46.840- 20:53.100* :  delamination, which is basically where the layers of carbon fiber come apart, which is an issue.
*20:53.100- 20:59.000* :  The other thing is that every time it was going down and becoming compressed and then coming back
*20:59.040- 21:04.320* :  up again and going down again, because it had done lots of dives, it was weakening the material.
*21:04.320- 21:10.080* :  So in a weird sort of way, the passengers who went on the first dive with the Titan actually
*21:10.360- 21:15.140* :  probably would have been safer than the people who went on the last dive with Titan, which is so
*21:15.140- 21:19.640* :  counterintuitive, you would think, oh well, it's been down lots of times. It's fine. It's done it
*21:19.640- 21:23.960* :  before when actually the opposite was true. The third thing we've heard from the evidence is that
*21:23.960- 21:30.840* :  it could just go at any time without warning. So it was a really unorthodox material and there
*21:30.840- 21:35.880* :  were a lot of concerns over the fact it hadn't been tested. If you're going to use something unorthodox,
*21:35.880- 21:40.160* :  I mean, it's a fairly new industry, try new materials, but the experts are saying you've got to
*21:40.160- 21:45.320* :  test it. And again, so much of what you're saying there, red flags are popping in my head, nonstop
*21:45.320- 21:49.260* :  listening to you. And it just keeps going towards that key question. And the answer feels like
*21:49.260- 21:52.980* :  it could have been prevented. I mean, that's what these hearings are trying to determine right now.
*21:53.700- 21:57.800* :  One person, David Lockridge, a former operations director, said he was among those to raise
*21:57.800- 22:03.900* :  concerns, didn't he? Yeah, no, he was very interesting because he basically worked for the company
*22:03.900- 22:11.080* :  in 2018 when the Titan sub was in development. And he did not like what he was seeing.
*22:11.400- 22:18.440* :  The way the company were going with this project and bypassing all the standardized rules and
*22:18.440- 22:24.140* :  regulations that are set in place by people with experience, it was inevitable something was
*22:24.140- 22:31.680* :  going to happen and it was just when. So he brought his concerns to Dr. Rush. He assembled a quality
*22:31.680- 22:40.240* :  assessment report that was presented to the company in 2018. He was summoned to a meeting which
*22:40.540- 22:45.340* :  the transcript is now available on the US Coast Guard's website and it's a very heated exchange
*22:45.340- 22:50.500* :  between them with basically David Lockridge repeatedly saying, I'm really worried about
*22:50.500- 22:56.380* :  this. Most of all, no one's listening to me and Dr. Rush saying, I think it's safe we're at an
*22:56.380- 23:02.520* :  impasse. Lockridge was fired after that meeting, but he was so worried. He actually took his concerns
*23:02.520- 23:10.900* :  to the US occupational safety and health administration. That's OSHA. And he detailed all of his
*23:10.900- 23:18.980* :  worries about the sub's design. But Ocean Gate then sued him for revealing confidential
*23:19.100- 23:24.400* :  information. I mean, he also counter sued them for unfair dismissal. So, you know, this is
*23:24.400- 23:29.820* :  costing more and more money. I think about 11 months after raising the concerns and going to OSHA,
*23:29.820- 23:35.720* :  he decided to drop the case and signed a non-disclosure agreement. I mean, what was very interesting
*23:35.860- 23:42.680* :  at the hearing at the end of an entire day's worth of evidence? He basically said, you had the
*23:42.680- 23:48.540* :  information, OSHA had everything. So, there are definitely questions there about whether the US
*23:48.540- 23:53.360* :  authorities could have stepped in. And he described the company culture as smoke and mirrors, didn't he?
*23:53.820- 23:57.400* :  We've also heard from other staff during the hearings that there wasn't necessarily a culture
*23:57.400- 24:02.900* :  of transparency while communicating safety concerns. I just felt that that didn't seem like the
*24:02.900- 24:07.300* :  customer's concerns were taken particularly seriously. When people would have a legitimate
*24:07.300- 24:14.140* :  concern, it just seemed like they either wouldn't bring it up. Or, in my case, I was entirely dismissed.
*24:14.840- 24:19.460* :  But when it comes to the customers, not everyone felt that way. Yeah, that's right. I mean, we heard
*24:19.460- 24:26.480* :  evidence from two of the paying passengers, Renata Rojas and Fred Hagen. And both of them actually
*24:26.480- 24:32.700* :  spoke about a company that was safety conscious. They said that there were extensive safety
*24:32.700- 24:40.880* :  briefings before every dive. They felt that on the ship, the support ship, there was a good culture
*24:40.880- 24:46.740* :  of safety. They didn't describe a rogue operation in that sense. And Fred Hagen, in particular,
*24:46.740- 24:53.400* :  said that he felt like he was going into the sub with his eyes open. I mean, he knew it was a
*24:53.400- 24:59.520* :  dangerous endeavor, but he was willing to take the risk. Anyone that felt safe going to depths
*24:59.520- 25:04.380* :  in the Titan was deluded or delusional. I mean, it was an experimental vessel. It was clear that it
*25:04.380- 25:11.160* :  was dangerous. And anyone that wanted to go, it was either delusional if they thought it wasn't
*25:11.160- 25:16.260* :  dangerous, or they were just embracing the sense of risk. And Fred Hagen, in fact, had testified
*25:16.260- 25:22.720* :  that the mission was scrapped when there were mechanical issues before right. So the risk to the
*25:22.720- 25:27.860* :  submersible wasn't just theoretical. People did describe actual physical damage.
*25:28.880- 25:34.420* :  One of the things that was very interesting during the public hearing was that the Titan
*25:34.420- 25:44.400* :  submersible over 2021 and 2022 had gone down to see the Titanic 13 times. It had 13 dives there,
*25:44.800- 25:49.840* :  but lots of other dives in between where it hadn't quite made it down as deep passengers hadn't
*25:49.840- 26:00.060* :  seen it. But during these two years of expeditions, 118 technical incidents were listed. And they
*26:00.060- 26:07.980* :  ranged from the batteries dying. So when one dive, the passengers were stuck inside for 27 hours
*26:07.980- 26:14.220* :  on another dive while this sub was being recovered out of the water and brought up to the deck of
*26:14.220- 26:18.820* :  the ship. It was dropped, and the front dome sheared off. It fell off. I mean, this is a bit that
*26:18.820- 26:25.560* :  supposed to be watertight. There's been a lot of discussion about a loud bang that was heard while
*26:25.560- 26:32.240* :  the sub was coming back up to the surface after one of the dives. And actually the US Coast Guard
*26:32.240- 26:38.420* :  heard evidence that this was most likely caused by damage to the hull. Although at the time
*26:39.140- 26:45.120* :  Ocean Gate said it was actually just the sub shifting around in its metal frame. Thrusters
*26:45.120- 26:50.620* :  not working. There's subspinning. Fred Hagen described it being tangled up in the wreck of the
*26:50.620- 26:55.040* :  Titanic only for a minute or two. So I mean, it's been very interesting to hear this catalogue,
*26:55.040- 26:59.400* :  this list, this litany of incidents where things went wrong during the dives.
*26:59.900- 27:05.780* :  So I want to look beyond the hearings now. Once the testimony concludes, what actually happens next?
*27:06.160- 27:11.580* :  Well, the testimony is not the end of this. It's part of the process. So the US Coast Guard will
*27:11.580- 27:18.240* :  continue to gather evidence. And one of the things they do have to do is to really carefully examine
*27:18.240- 27:24.740* :  the wreckage that was recovered. I think one of the most startling images really that were
*27:25.240- 27:31.560* :  released with the pictures of the wreckage of the submersible in pieces mangled and crushed
*27:32.340- 27:39.100* :  scattered across hundreds meters across the floor of the Atlantic. So they want to find out which
*27:39.160- 27:45.540* :  part of the submersible was the first to fail. And they will eventually be publishing a report
*27:46.360- 27:52.780* :  detailing everything they've learnt. It's likely that there will be prosecutions by the US
*27:52.780- 28:01.060* :  government because the question is, if you knew about their safety concerns but ignored them before
*28:01.060- 28:08.520* :  the event, what does that mean? We have to watch that space, but I think that is likely to follow
*28:08.520- 28:14.180* :  and then, you know, there are private lawsuits happening, the family of P.H. Narsiala, the Titanic
*28:14.180- 28:19.520* :  expert who died in the implosion, they're already suing. Looking towards the future, I think the
*28:19.520- 28:26.040* :  big question is, how can you stop something like this from happening again? Everything goes back
*28:26.060- 28:32.520* :  to the regulations and certifications. One of the things I think is likely to come out of this
*28:33.280- 28:39.860* :  is that submersibles will have to be certified. So you think this will likely have
*28:39.860- 28:46.060* :  broader implications for the industry. People won't be able to bypass certification like happened
*28:46.060- 28:50.760* :  in this case. That's right. And I mean, interestingly, the parallel with this is after the Titanic
*28:51.380- 28:57.520* :  sank. It changed the rules and regulations about what you could do at sea. So this is likely to
*28:57.520- 29:04.660* :  change the rules and regulations of what you can do down in the deep sea. It's very interesting
*29:04.720- 29:10.720* :  this because a few people have said, I hope that this incident doesn't stop innovation,
*29:10.760- 29:16.660* :  doesn't stop exploration. But in a way, you sort of testing and regulations can increase
*29:16.660- 29:21.720* :  innovation. It means you can look at new materials. The thing I think it's really important to say,
*29:21.720- 29:27.040* :  though, is Oceangate, where an outlier in this. I mean, I've been reporting on the deep sea
*29:27.040- 29:35.700* :  for 10 or 15 years. And people in the industry take safety really seriously. I love the deep sea.
*29:35.700- 29:39.940* :  You know, I think it's a fascinating place. I'm fascinated by the people who go down there to
*29:39.940- 29:44.600* :  explore it. There's a guy called Victor Vescovo. He's got his own submersible that's been to the
*29:44.600- 29:50.840* :  bottom of the Mariana trench multiple times. But he got his submersible certified. You can
*29:50.840- 29:59.520* :  explore and innovate safely. And people have been doing it for years. Rebecca, thanks so much.
