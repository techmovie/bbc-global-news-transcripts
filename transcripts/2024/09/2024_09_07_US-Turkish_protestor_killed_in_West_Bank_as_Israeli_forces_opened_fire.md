*00:59.620- 01:04.320* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*01:04.320- 01:09.480* :  prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates
*01:09.480- 01:14.500* :  those owners to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hollywood

*01:32.240- 01:38.500* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Janet Jalil and in the early
*01:38.500- 01:44.000* :  hours of Saturday 7th September, these are our main stories. Is Ready Soldiers a reported to a
*01:44.000- 01:48.880* :  shot dead an American woman in the occupied West Bank during a protest against Jewish settlements?
*01:49.720- 01:54.100* :  The judge in Donald Trump's criminal hush money case postponed sentencing until
*01:54.100- 02:01.040* :  after the US presidential election. At least 70 children are still unaccounted for after a deadly
*02:01.040- 02:14.420* :  fire at a school in Kenya. Also in this podcast, the boss and over legend Sergio Mendes has died at
*02:14.420- 02:25.940* :  the age of 83. We begin in the Middle East. A 26-year-old American woman is reported to have been
*02:25.940- 02:33.380* :  shot dead by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank. Ishanore Ezgi Igi, who's of Turkish descent,
*02:33.380- 02:38.800* :  was taking part in a protest against Jewish settlement expansion in the town of Beta and in
*02:38.800- 02:44.380* :  Nablus when she was shot in the head. A fellow activist Jonathan Pollack was also there.
*02:45.060- 02:52.340* :  What happened today is no accident. It is the continuation of the killing of 17 of Beta's
*02:52.340- 02:59.860* :  residents during demonstrations since 2021. It is an intentional killing that is now receiving
*02:59.860- 03:05.960* :  the light of day because she's an American citizen. It was an intentional killing that cannot
*03:05.960- 03:11.740* :  be justified. The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the killing. The Israeli
*03:11.740- 03:17.300* :  military says it's looking into the incident. The US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, gave this
*03:17.300- 03:26.400* :  reaction to the death. We deplore this tragic loss. Now, the most important thing to do is
*03:26.400- 03:31.820* :  to gather the facts and that's exactly what we're in the process of doing and we are intensely
*03:31.820- 03:38.200* :  focused on getting those facts. The UN has called for a full investigation into the death of the
*03:38.200- 03:44.340* :  American Turkish Jewel National. A correspondent in Jerusalem, Mike Thompson, told us more about how she
*03:44.340- 03:51.120* :  came to die. She was attending apparently a regular demonstration against settlement expansion
*03:51.120- 03:57.380* :  in the West Bank, which has been increasing at quite a pace. And according to local media,
*03:57.380- 04:03.460* :  Israeli troops tried to suppress the demonstration that they used. It said live ammunition,
*04:03.460- 04:09.040* :  stun grenades and tear gas to try and stop what was happening. And in the midst of all this,
*04:09.400- 04:15.200* :  it thought the young American woman was hitting the head. She was then taken to hospital in
*04:15.320- 04:21.040* :  Nablus, but medics there were unable to save her life and she was pronounced dead. It was only a
*04:21.040- 04:28.040* :  few weeks ago in the village of Jeet in the West Bank that around 100 settlers invaded the village.
*04:28.040- 04:35.600* :  Cars were burnt, homes were burnt down and a local resident was killed in the clashes that followed.
*04:36.080- 04:41.920* :  And these attacks have been increasing, especially since the start of the Gaza war,
*04:42.360- 04:45.620* :  causing quite a lot of alarm. And there have been several people killed.
*04:46.860- 04:51.640* :  This latest shooting came after the Israeli army ended one of its most destructive raids in
*04:51.640- 04:56.600* :  the occupied West Bank for years in the city of Jeannine. Over the course of more than a week,
*04:56.600- 05:02.480* :  Israeli forces killed dozens of people and caused widespread destruction of streets, homes and
*05:02.480- 05:08.380* :  businesses. Israel said it was acting against terrorists. Some of those killed were militants,
*05:08.380- 05:12.480* :  but some were children. Lucy Williams sent this report from Jeannine.
*05:14.580- 05:20.700* :  After more than nine days of virtual siege, people here are impatient to reclaim their city.
*05:21.640- 05:25.360* :  In Jeannine's cramped refugee camp, residents were emerging this morning,
*05:25.360- 05:32.580* :  stunned and exhausted to assess the damage. We found Khalid Abu Sabir in his basement apartment.
*05:33.320- 05:39.280* :  The army had evacuated him and his wife, he said, before blowing up a cave under the mosque next door.
*05:40.040- 05:48.220* :  There's just nothing left of Khalid Abu Sabir's home. It's just mountains of rubble, tiny sticks of
*05:48.240- 05:54.400* :  furniture sticking out of it. It feels like we are starting our lives all over again. This house
*05:54.400- 05:59.220* :  was all we had. We didn't expect the whole house to be destroyed. We don't know where to go.
*06:01.480- 06:06.980* :  On the floor above, we found Mustafa Antir standing stunned in the flat of his daughter,
*06:06.980- 06:13.820* :  a seal. It's damaged, but intact. He tells me he and his daughter both left the camp during
*06:13.820- 06:19.980* :  the incursion under heavy fire and that two others who evacuated were shot. It was impossible to
*06:19.980- 06:26.700* :  tell where it was coming from. Explosions, drones, shootings, here, here and from the sky.
*06:27.080- 06:33.340* :  We evacuated in groups of 10 to 20, taking roads not completely safe. Those carrying white flags
*06:33.840- 06:38.740* :  but far from us. A seal arrives minutes later, carrying her five-year-old daughter.
*06:38.740- 06:46.560* :  Mustafa waves her in and pulls her close for a hug. Don't be scared, he tells her. A seal looks around
*06:46.680- 06:50.800* :  to shock to speak. Her daughter silent in her arms.
*06:52.940- 06:59.480* :  For the past nine days and ten nights, gunfire and explosions from inside the camp have broken
*06:59.480- 07:07.480* :  the silence of a Janine. Israel said that 14 terrorists had been eliminated during this operation
*07:08.060- 07:13.480* :  and dozens of explosives destroyed along with a weapon's storage facility beneath a mosque.
*07:14.180- 07:17.380* :  Khalid told us there was nothing in the cave they blew up.
*07:20.240- 07:25.800* :  Today, the dead were released along with the living. Bodies kept for days in hospital morgues
*07:26.120- 07:31.560* :  buried in the cemetery next to the camp. Among them, Muhammad Zubaydi, an armed fighter.
*07:32.280- 07:37.840* :  His father, once the local leader of Al-Aqsa martyrs brigades now in an Israeli prison.
*07:38.800- 07:41.820* :  Abu Fariz, who lives in the camp, was at the funeral.
*07:42.980- 07:48.260* :  They come, they go, they come back, we don't mind. The one we lose is a martyr. The one they lose
*07:48.260- 07:55.060* :  goes to hell. Today, we can't confront them directly. We attack and retreat, each trying to hunt the
*07:55.060- 08:02.980* :  other. Inside Janine camp, old bullet holes sit side by side with fresh graffiti celebrating Hamas,
*08:03.700- 08:11.760* :  years of violent confrontation etched into its walls, operations end, the battle here never has.
*08:13.900- 08:19.960* :  That report by Lucy Williamson in Janine. A judge in New York has delayed Donald Trump's
*08:19.960- 08:25.160* :  sentencing over his criminal hush money case until after the US presidential election.
*08:25.180- 08:30.280* :  He was found guilty earlier this year of falsifying business records to cover up payments
*08:30.280- 08:35.940* :  which were made to a porn star stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. I spoke to our
*08:35.940- 08:42.260* :  correspondent John Sudworth, who was outside Trump Tower in New York. Essentially, this will be
*08:42.260- 08:48.280* :  seen as a victory for Donald Trump. It's certainly what his lawyers were pushing for. The lesser
*08:48.280- 08:53.200* :  from the judge in response to their request to delay this sentencing makes it sound as if it's
*08:53.200- 08:59.660* :  been agreed through gritted teeth, making the point that the case they were making that to deliver
*08:59.660- 09:04.540* :  this sentence ahead of the election would risk influencing that election. You know, it's been
*09:04.540- 09:10.020* :  something that Judge Merchant at every stage of the trial and what's happened afterwards has
*09:10.060- 09:17.020* :  been at pains to dispute. Today, I concede that however unwarranted, as he put it,
*09:17.540- 09:21.880* :  there could potentially be the impression of a conflict of interest that people may interpret
*09:21.880- 09:28.940* :  the sentences as being somehow designed to influence the election or in some way influenced by it.
*09:28.940- 09:34.720* :  And for those reasons, because of that risk of appearing to be tainted in that way,
*09:34.720- 09:41.080* :  he has agreed to postpone it until, as you say, November the 26th. Democrats are not going to be
*09:41.080- 09:46.000* :  happy about this, but it was a difficult dilemma for this judge because whichever way he decided,
*09:46.000- 09:51.020* :  he was going to face criticism. Yeah, I think you have to agree with that. It was a very tricky
*09:51.020- 09:56.580* :  decision. This is a very contested divisive political landscape that this election is taking place in,
*09:56.580- 10:02.040* :  this case obviously right at the centre of it, and the risk for the judge, as he admits himself,
*10:02.040- 10:06.560* :  was the appearance that more than justice was being done here, that something else was at stake.
*10:06.560- 10:11.480* :  Of course, the counter argument, what some would now see as the risk is it means Americans go to
*10:11.480- 10:17.340* :  the polls on November the 5th, not knowing whether one of the candidates, one of the leading candidates,
*10:17.340- 10:23.220* :  the Republican nominee for president is going to face either a fine, where many people see it as
*10:23.220- 10:28.060* :  unlikely, but it's still there as a possibility, a custodial sentence. Those things, of course,
*10:28.060- 10:33.000* :  are significant, but now the knowledge of which of those two options he is likely to be given will
*10:33.000- 10:39.640* :  have to wait until after they've cast their votes. John Sudworth, as we record this podcast,
*10:39.640- 10:45.500* :  Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is beginning its journey back to planet Earth, leaving behind its
*10:45.500- 10:51.320* :  two stranded astronauts Sunni Williams and a butch Wilmore, who remain on board the International
*10:51.320- 10:57.540* :  Space Station. The empty capsule which had developed technical problems undocked automatically from
*10:57.540- 11:05.240* :  the ISS on Friday evening. This is a moment it did so. Separation confirmed. Starliner is now
*11:05.240- 11:11.400* :  back in a way from station and starting its return to Earth. Starliner stars will then complete
*11:11.400- 11:17.120* :  two short firings to gradually increase the separation speed to help the spacecraft carefully move away
*11:17.120- 11:23.180* :  from the orbiting lab. The two astronauts will now have to wait until next February when they're
*11:23.180- 11:29.040* :  expected to return to Earth in a SpaceX crew dragon, extending a stay that was supposed to be
*11:29.040- 11:36.580* :  eight days to eight months on the ISS. Richard Trebu is Space reporter at Orlando Sentinel Media Group.
*11:37.040- 11:42.200* :  He explains what will happen to the Starliner capsule on its journey back to Earth.
*11:42.780- 11:49.160* :  It has a six hour flight return home targeting a landing in the desert in the white
*11:49.160- 11:57.420* :  sand area of New Mexico and then after that they're going to ship it back to Kennedy Space Center
*11:57.420- 12:03.880* :  where Boeing's factory is for the Starliner and go over all the data and see if they can fix
*12:03.880- 12:09.100* :  all of the problems that they found on the flight up when it went up there back in June.
*12:09.100- 12:14.400* :  It's not a great look for Boeing. They've got plenty of other issues on their plate but NASA
*12:14.880- 12:22.340* :  likes the vehicle. They just wish that all the little parts that have failed on this trip were
*12:22.660- 12:29.940* :  a little bit more reliable. Space reporter Richard Trebu, a fire at a boy's boarding school in Kenya
*12:29.940- 12:36.180* :  has caused devastation. At least 17 children are already known to have died but the agony continues
*12:36.180- 12:40.800* :  not just for their families but for those of dozens of other boys who still don't know their
*12:40.800- 12:47.980* :  fates. Kenya's deputy president says 70 children still remain unaccounted for. The fire began at
*12:47.980- 12:52.680* :  night in a dormitory at the school in central Kenya before engulfing the building which mainly
*12:52.680- 12:58.340* :  consists of wooden planks. The cause of the blaze is still not clear. Our Africa correspondent
*12:58.340- 13:06.680* :  Barbara Letasha reports from the scene. Parents gathered at the school overcome with shock and sorrow.
*13:06.700- 13:13.020* :  They were taken to see the bodies of the children still in the dormitory. Many burnt beyond recognition.
*13:13.020- 13:18.080* :  The fire broke out overnight while the boys were sleeping. Some escaped the flames by crawling
*13:18.080- 13:23.780* :  under beds. Others ran into the night. John Gathogos said there was no news of what may have happened
*13:23.780- 13:31.880* :  to his nephew. He said it was torturous and painful waiting to find out. Many people in the
*13:31.880- 13:37.440* :  neighborhood rushed to help the firefighters. In the chaos, boys went missing. The deputy president
*13:37.440- 13:43.220* :  Regathe Gashagua visited the school to comfort the parents there and urged others to report if they
*13:57.280- 14:00.940* :  had picked up their children. This is a terrible tragedy. But fires at boarding schools in Kenya
*14:00.940- 14:06.860* :  are common. Many said to be because of arson. It's not known what caused this one. Officials have
*14:06.860- 14:12.820* :  promised a thorough investigation which might bring a certain resolution at some point. But right
*14:12.820- 14:20.160* :  now there is only raw grief and anger. Barbara Letasha reporting. In an earlier edition of this
*14:20.160- 14:25.060* :  podcast, we told you that the country worst affected by M-POK, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*14:25.520- 14:30.760* :  had finally received its first batch of vaccines against the virus. Three weeks after the
*14:30.760- 14:35.920* :  World Health Organization declared the current outbreak a global health emergency. The highly
*14:35.920- 14:42.420* :  infectious disease has killed more than 650 people in Congo, most of them children. Many of the
*14:42.420- 14:47.420* :  cases are in remote eastern parts of the country. But as I corresponded to the town of Goma,
*14:47.420- 14:53.020* :  Simi Jolarsso reports, it will still be some time before they receive the vaccine.
*14:53.700- 14:59.880* :  The arrival of 99,000 doses of a vaccine that could help curb the M-POK's outbreak has been
*14:59.880- 15:05.680* :  long awaited. Although health officials have said they may only begin giving jabs in October,
*15:05.680- 15:11.800* :  giving them time to train health workers. It's not pleasing news to the thousands and camps for
*15:11.800- 15:18.300* :  internally displaced people who are eagerly awaiting them. Like Farahar Makambo, who lives in Mujah
*15:18.300- 15:25.720* :  Camp, Goma, her three children had M-POK's. Let the doctors bring us the vaccine. The vaccine is
*15:25.720- 15:31.480* :  very important because if the disease progresses, children will already be protected and there will be
*15:31.480- 15:37.360* :  less risk of contamination. The epidemic may spread, but it won't be very dangerous if we are
*15:37.360- 15:41.460* :  protected. Nima, as you see away, who lives in the same camp, agrees.
*15:44.240- 15:49.860* :  Our children get sick every day from M-POK's. That's why we want help with the vaccine, so we can
*15:49.860- 15:56.060* :  be protected. There will be several challenges to get those vaccines to this eastern region of the
*15:56.060- 16:02.000* :  D.R. Congo. There's the vastness of the country, the precise temperature at which the vaccine must
*16:02.000- 16:07.980* :  be kept and transported. Then of course, there's an ongoing fighting between the army and armed
*16:07.980- 16:14.660* :  rebel group M-23. It's a concern of Dr Gaston-Bulambo, head of North Kivu's provincial health division.
*16:17.880- 16:23.240* :  The conflict is having a profound effect on the vaccination programme. It's not just vaccination
*16:23.240- 16:28.600* :  against M-POK's, but even the whole vaccination programme is suffering because of difficulties in
*16:28.600- 16:34.640* :  getting vaccines to health zones. This is due to insecurity. The government has said in the meantime,
*16:34.640- 16:41.180* :  it's trying to relieve the overcrowding in camps and provide hygiene supplies. Things people there
*16:41.180- 16:51.100* :  have long called for. Simea Joll also in Goma. Still to come, scientists discover a substance that
*16:51.100- 16:56.400* :  makes a skin of mice transparent. The researchers did an experiment where they rubbed it on the
*16:56.400- 17:01.560* :  belly of a nude mouse, and you could see the internal structure. The liver, the kidneys, the colon,
*17:01.560- 17:06.420* :  the ordinarily obviously you can't see in a mouse. So could this be a breakthrough that revolutionises
*17:16.720- 17:19.400* :  biomedical research? It took a lifetime to find the person you want to marry,

*18:42.920- 18:47.220* :  At a meeting in Germany, he said this was the only way to bring about an end to the war.
*18:47.720- 18:52.200* :  He spoke to representatives of about 50 nations at the United States airbase in Ramstein
*18:52.200- 18:57.120* :  before then holding talks with the German Chancellor Olaf Schultz. He is our defence correspondent
*18:57.120- 19:03.540* :  Jonathan Beal. This was the 24th meeting of the US-led Ramstein group set up to keep the
*19:03.540- 19:08.420* :  flow of Western weapons and ammunition to Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion.
*19:09.360- 19:15.260* :  But it was the first time President Zelensky had attended in person, a sign that he sees this
*19:15.260- 19:21.420* :  as a critical moment in the war, keen to make the most of Ukraine's recent incursion into Russia.
*19:22.220- 19:28.120* :  He started with familiar themes. Ukraine was grateful for Western support, but still needed more.
*19:28.760- 19:35.120* :  He politely chastised allies for failing to deliver on previous promises of more air defenses.
*19:36.020- 19:42.020* :  He noted that supplies of long-range weapons from the US, UK and France had slowed.
*19:42.760- 19:49.440* :  Once again, he pleaded with allies to allow Ukraine to use those weapons to hit targets inside
*19:49.440- 19:57.000* :  Russia itself. Now we hear that your long-range policy has not changed. We think it is wrong
*19:57.000- 20:03.520* :  that there are such steps. We need to have this long-range capability not only on the occupied
*20:03.520- 20:11.220* :  territory of Ukraine, but also on the Russian territory. Yes, so that Russia is motivated to seek peace.
*20:12.160- 20:15.540* :  There was no indication that President Zelensky had shifted minds.
*20:16.420- 20:21.640* :  Germany's defence minister said the policy on the use of long-range missiles hadn't changed.
*20:22.440- 20:26.540* :  The US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said it wouldn't turn the tide of the war.
*20:27.360- 20:31.900* :  There were new pledges of military aid, including shorter-range missiles, artillery,
*20:31.900- 20:37.040* :  and armoured vehicles. But President Zelensky will still leave frustrated.
*20:38.440- 20:43.860* :  Jonathan Bill. Now, this sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but it could well be a breakthrough
*20:43.860- 20:49.460* :  that revolutionises biomedical research. Scientists have discovered that a commonly used
*20:49.460- 20:55.960* :  food colouring can make the skin of a mouse temporarily transparent, allowing them to see its organ's
*20:55.960- 21:01.380* :  function. If successfully tested in humans, it could have wide-ranging applications in medicine
*21:01.380- 21:06.760* :  and health care. The research has been published in the Journal of Science. Dr Christopher Rodens,
*21:06.760- 21:12.280* :  a specialist in using light to study biology from Imperial College in London, spoke to Anita
*21:12.280- 21:16.740* :  Annand about the procedure. It's literally a dye, it's a food dye tartarine.
*21:17.000- 21:21.740* :  You've probably eaten some, maybe even today, it's commonly found in many crisp products and that
*21:21.740- 21:27.640* :  kind of thing. The key insight of the research was to instead of trying to look for a material that
*21:27.640- 21:33.780* :  makes the tissue not absorb and not scatter, they said, okay, what if we don't care about absorption,
*21:34.440- 21:39.680* :  but we just care about the scattering, and we can use a dye that uses a phenomenon known as the
*21:39.680- 21:43.360* :  Kramer's chronic relations to alter the refractive index? Are you talking about a cream that you
*21:43.360- 21:47.600* :  can rub on the skin? I mean, shave a mouse, rub this on the skin and you can see through it
*21:47.840- 21:52.920* :  without the use of anything else. Not necessarily through it, but certainly through much deeper into
*21:52.920- 21:57.540* :  its organs than it would ordinarily be able to. So the researchers did an experiment where they
*21:57.540- 22:03.480* :  rubbed it on the belly of a nude mouse, and you could see the internal structure, the liver,
*22:03.960- 22:08.400* :  the colon, that ordinarily obviously you can't see in a mouse. I mean, that's amazing. I mean,
*22:08.400- 22:13.800* :  without the repercussions could be extraordinary for human beings without any kind of operation,
*22:13.800- 22:18.280* :  or indeed radiation of x-rays, you could get a really good look quite deep inside a human body.
*22:18.440- 22:21.980* :  I think it's important to be clear, we're not advocating that people go out and buy a
*22:21.980- 22:27.800* :  tetacardrasine and rub it into their skin. It is an FDA-approved food dye, so we think it's safe,
*22:27.800- 22:31.840* :  but it's safe for consumption, and we don't know if it's safe for rubbing into your eyes or something.
*22:32.000- 22:36.800* :  Okay, so that's very good. Do not do this at home, but is this going to be a revolution?
*22:36.940- 22:42.780* :  Certainly, for my field, yes. We routinely in optics struggle to get light to go more than a
*22:42.780- 22:47.500* :  millimeter also into tissue. There are advanced techniques that require you to use multi-photon
*22:47.500- 22:52.620* :  lasers, very expensive lasers, to image deep, and we argue about a millimeter, a millimeter and a
*22:52.620- 22:56.940* :  half, and these guys have come along and said we can image nearly a centimeter into tissue.
*22:57.040- 23:00.840* :  Okay, so when you put this stuff on the nude mouse, can you just wash it off and the mouse is fine?
*23:01.120- 23:06.280* :  Apparently so, and this is one of the one of the revolutionary things about it, is it appears
*23:06.280- 23:11.180* :  to be completely benign. You wash it off and it goes back to being opaque, just exactly the same
*23:11.180- 23:17.820* :  as before, a scurries off, runs away, and is fine. Amazing. Dr. Christopher Rowlands from Imperial
*23:17.820- 23:30.680* :  College in London. Now, that's a distinctive bossan over classic mash canada by the Brazilian
*23:30.680- 23:36.560* :  musician Sergio Mendez, who's died at the age of 83. He helped to popularise bossan over and
*23:36.560- 23:41.060* :  Sambo with Western audiences and was also known for putting Brazilian twists on English songs
*23:41.060- 23:45.920* :  such as The Look of Love and The Beatles, The Fool on the Hill. Our entertainment correspondent
*23:45.920- 23:51.540* :  Mark Savage told us more about him. You might not recognise his name, but if you play those songs,
*23:51.540- 23:56.920* :  people know them around the world. Mash canada in particular, a cover of the Georgia band song,
*23:56.920- 24:03.040* :  but his version is the definitive version, a really slinky, kind of seductive, sunkist,
*24:03.040- 24:09.380* :  Brazilian pop song that conquered the charts in the late 60s and kind of triggered his career.
*24:09.380- 24:15.140* :  He was born in Brazil and studied classical piano, but when he heard Take 5 by the Dave Brubeck
*24:15.140- 24:20.420* :  quartet, he decided that was what he wanted to do because suddenly he discovered you could improvise.
*24:20.420- 24:25.380* :  He'd never been told studying classical piano that you could stray from the notes that were written
*24:25.380- 24:30.620* :  on the page. And that inspired him to form jazz quartets, then the bossan over craze happened in
*24:30.620- 24:36.780* :  Brazil. He started getting into that and moved to the US in 1964 because of the military coup
*24:37.200- 24:42.360* :  in Brazil. And there, he realised that he could not only make jazz, but he could popularise
*24:42.360- 24:48.520* :  bossan over, and he used both the Western idiom. He would cover a lot of Western songs by acts
*24:48.520- 24:54.260* :  like The Beatles and Frank Sinatra and combine them with Brazilian rhythms, but he would also bring
*24:54.260- 24:59.680* :  Brazilian songs and westernise them. And he just introduced the world to this song, you know,
*24:59.680- 25:06.120* :  before that, really all that America knew of Brazilian music was Carmen Miranda, you know, with her
*25:07.100- 25:13.160* :  towering hat covered in grapes and bananas, but he really brought a sophistication to Brazilian
*25:13.160- 25:18.920* :  music in the US. And the great thing about him was that for generation after generation,
*25:19.180- 25:26.220* :  they kept discovering him, his appeal was enduring. Yes, so, you know, he recorded 35 albums for the
*25:26.220- 25:31.780* :  first 20 years of his career. He recorded an album a year. And of course, you know, his skill was
*25:31.780- 25:35.960* :  in arranging because a lot of those songs were covers. You know, he did the look of love and he
*25:35.960- 25:40.620* :  performed that at the Academy Awards, that brought him to a bigger audience. He covered The Beatles,
*25:40.620- 25:45.660* :  The Fool on the Hill, and Paul McCartney wrote him a letter and said that is my favourite version
*25:45.660- 25:52.040* :  of that song. But as you say, over generations, he got rediscovered by hip-hop artists who would
*25:52.040- 25:56.840* :  sample his music. And then he started taking an interest in what they were doing and did a
*25:56.840- 26:02.640* :  collaboration with the Black Eyed Peas, and then an album of collaborations with modern pop artists,
*26:02.660- 26:08.700* :  so he did duets with Justin Timberlick and Erika Badu. And he was recording and performing right
*26:08.700- 26:14.920* :  up until November last year. And then unfortunately, he had a bout of COVID that affected his
*26:14.920- 26:19.660* :  rest-reduced system and he had been ill for much of this year. And his family said he had passed away
*26:19.660- 26:25.180* :  peacefully in his adopted home time of Los Angeles. Our entertainment correspondent Mark Savage
*26:25.180- 26:30.980* :  looking back on the life of Brazilian musician Sergio Mendes, who has died at the age of 83.
