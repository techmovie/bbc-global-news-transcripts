*01:20.560- 01:24.720* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Saturday, the 21st of September, these are our main
*01:24.720- 01:29.360* :  stories. The Israeli military says it's killed the head of an elite Hezbollah unit,
*01:29.780- 01:33.840* :  along with other commanders in an airstrike on the Lebanese capital Beirut.
*01:34.460- 01:39.500* :  A report on the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a rally in July has criticised
*01:39.500- 01:43.620* :  the US security services, saying they suffered a communications breakdown.
*01:45.920- 01:49.700* :  Also in this podcast, we say goodbye to a master of the voiceover.
*01:50.180- 01:53.780* :  Hello! Let's watch some television.
*01:54.260- 01:59.420* :  From Grandpa Pig to Thunderbirds, the actor David Graham, who has died at the age of 99.
*02:03.620- 02:09.180* :  The Israeli military says it's killed around 10 Hezbollah commanders in an airstrike in the Lebanese
*02:09.180- 02:15.480* :  capital Beirut. The most senior is said to be Ibrahim Akhil, acting head of the group's elite
*02:15.480- 02:21.680* :  Radwan unit. His bowler is prescribed as a terrorist organisation by the US, the UK,
*02:21.680- 02:27.600* :  and other Western governments. The Lebanese health ministry said nearly 60 people were injured
*02:27.600- 02:32.880* :  in the Israeli strike on a high-rise block of flats. Had a news briefing on Friday,
*02:32.880- 02:39.040* :  the spokesman of the Israeli Defence Forces, or IDF, Daniel Hagari, gave details of the attack.
*02:39.700- 02:47.660* :  Today, the IDF conducted a targeted strike in Beirut, on senior terrorist Ibrahim Akhil,
*02:48.360- 02:54.060* :  the head of Hezbollah's operations and the commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces.
*02:55.480- 03:02.560* :  I can now confirm that Ibrahim Akhil was eliminated together with other senior terrorists
*03:02.560- 03:09.100* :  in Hezbollah's Radwan forces. Lebanon's ambassador to London, Rami Murtada told the BBC
*03:09.100- 03:14.860* :  those responsible for the attacks wanted to impact on Lebanese society as well as Hezbollah.
*03:15.220- 03:22.020* :  It's no secret that it's an overwhelming attack. Of course, the effect on Hezbollah is massive.
*03:22.280- 03:28.700* :  On the Lebanese public at large, it was again very overwhelming. I think one of the aims of
*03:28.700- 03:36.080* :  this attack is to sow division and this array in the country. By all means, it's a full-fledged act
*03:36.080- 03:41.280* :  of war, act of aggression. And according to the United Nations, it's a war crime.
*03:41.980- 03:47.680* :  Hours later, Hezbollah confirmed its commander Ibrahim Akhil was killed in Friday's air strike.
*03:48.400- 03:53.000* :  Ben Brown heard more from the BBC's senior international correspondent, Alla Garin,
*03:53.000- 03:58.780* :  who's in bayret. The Israelis are saying that they have killed Ibrahim Akhil. Certainly,
*03:58.780- 04:03.720* :  he is a big loss for the militant group. He was a very senior militant commander.
*04:03.840- 04:10.520* :  Israel is saying they killed him along with his entire chain of command. Now, we don't yet know
*04:10.520- 04:17.140* :  if civilians have been killed also in this strike. We do know that it took place in a densely
*04:17.140- 04:23.580* :  populated residential area and that a residential block was basically reduced to ruins.
*04:24.140- 04:29.180* :  Now, this is an area I've been in. It's always packed with people. This was very close to a
*04:29.180- 04:34.980* :  mosque. It was a Friday afternoon. We can be sure that lots of civilians were in this area.
*04:34.980- 04:40.680* :  The authorities here in Lebanon are telling us that 60 people have been wounded and there were
*04:40.680- 04:46.360* :  reports earlier this afternoon that five or six children were missing and unaccounted for.
*04:46.360- 04:52.380* :  We don't have any further information about that, but all of this comes not just after the
*04:52.380- 04:57.920* :  exploding pager attacks on the walkie-talkie attacks, which killed more than 30
*04:57.920- 05:05.840* :  has ball of fighters this week, but it also comes after 24 hours of intense Israeli bombardment
*05:05.840- 05:12.000* :  of southern Lebanon. That has been some of the heaviest firing that has taken place in the past
*05:12.000- 05:16.640* :  year of cross-border attacks. And during the course of the day,
*05:16.640- 05:23.440* :  Hasbola has been returning fire. So, what is your reading of what Israel's strategy is now?
*05:23.460- 05:27.860* :  Because we heard from the Defence Minister Yoav Galant saying there's going to be a new phase
*05:27.860- 05:33.840* :  of the war. And he's tweeted to say that the sequence of actions in the new phase will continue
*05:33.840- 05:39.280* :  until our goal is achieved, the safe return of the residents of the north of Israel to their homes.
*05:39.280- 05:44.400* :  That suggests all of this that we've seen this week is part of that new phase he was talking about.
*05:44.620- 05:49.820* :  Well, what is very clear is that Israel intends to keep up the pressure on Hasbola and in fact,
*05:49.820- 05:56.240* :  to keep increasing the pressure. We've had the wave of attacks earlier on this week on the pages
*05:56.240- 06:02.520* :  and the walkie-talkies that shattered the communications network for the armed group, which of course
*06:02.520- 06:10.300* :  is backed by Iran. We had a previous high-profile assassination at the end of July when Israel killed
*06:10.300- 06:17.340* :  the number two military commander in the same area in Beirut, Fouad Shukr. So, Israel is making
*06:17.340- 06:24.000* :  it very clear that it is not reducing the pressure now. We had a statement from the Hasbola leader
*06:24.000- 06:31.720* :  Hassan Nasrullah after the pager attacks saying that the organization had been hit hard, but its
*06:31.720- 06:38.340* :  command and control chain was still intact, that there would be retaliation, although he didn't
*06:38.340- 06:45.120* :  say when, but he insisted that Israel would not be able to achieve its aim of returning residents
*06:45.120- 06:51.560* :  to areas in the south. And you'll remember, Ben, that about 60,000 Israelis have had to leave
*06:51.560- 06:59.160* :  their homes close to the border because of this cross-border firing. And indeed about 90,000 Lebanese
*06:59.400- 07:05.300* :  had to leave their homes for the same reason. So, Israel is making it clear this is the new
*07:05.300- 07:11.740* :  center of gravity. As the Defense Minister has said, the focus has now shifted here to Lebanon
*07:11.740- 07:18.720* :  from Gaza. What's unclear is how far is Israel going to go? Is it going to go as far as a ground
*07:18.720- 07:25.360* :  invasion? Or is it going to try to keep damaging Hasbola from a distance and force the armed
*07:25.360- 07:31.360* :  group into a retreat from the area near the border? So far, there is no indication that Hasbola
*07:31.360- 07:36.720* :  is prepared to do that, but certainly it is a very weakened organization over the past few days,
*07:36.720- 07:42.840* :  but important to say, Ben, that it is still one of the most heavily armed non-state groups
*07:42.840- 07:48.740* :  in the world. Ornoguerin in Beirut, as we heard, the Israeli military said it killed the
*07:48.740- 07:54.520* :  senior Hasbola commander, Ibrahim Akhil. Analysts say he was certainly important within the
*07:54.520- 07:58.960* :  militant group described variously as a member of Hasbola's governing jihad council,
*07:59.480- 08:04.900* :  and the acting ahead of the group's elite, Radwan unit, and with a long history of striking not
*08:04.900- 08:11.180* :  just the Israeli, but U.S. targets as well. Julian Marshall spoke to Firas Maksad, a senior fellow
*08:11.180- 08:16.320* :  at the Middle East Institute in Washington. How significant a figure was, Ibrahim Akhil.
*08:17.000- 08:23.100* :  Very significant. The world one forces are obviously the special operation forces pretty much the
*08:23.100- 08:29.820* :  elite fighting force of Hasbola, and Akhil was not only the commander of that, but reportedly
*08:29.820- 08:37.720* :  after Israel's assassination of Hasbola's chief of staff back in July 30th. Akhil had also taken
*08:37.720- 08:44.220* :  on that role. So from late-breaking reports, this is quite a significant hit, particularly that
*08:44.220- 08:50.740* :  there are some indications that not only was he killed alone, but with the entire command of that
*08:50.740- 08:56.820* :  special operations unit within Hasbola. And that's special operations unit. What did it do?
*08:57.620- 09:02.900* :  These are the elite fighting force of Hasbola, sort of the equivalent of the Marines, so to speak,
*09:02.900- 09:09.720* :  in the United States. Within them is the anti-tank fighting brigades that are deployed in the south,
*09:09.720- 09:16.120* :  very effective, in terms of their firing on Israeli settlements. And so this is the Kremlin
*09:16.380- 09:21.420* :  of Hasbola's fighting force, and it's a pretty embarrassing and devastating blow.
*09:21.940- 09:27.040* :  So what would they have been doing in recent weeks, recent months? Are they involved in southern
*09:27.040- 09:35.060* :  Lebanon? Very much so. In fact, part of the diplomatic deal that the Biden administration has been
*09:35.060- 09:41.840* :  trying to unlock between Hasbola and Israel is the redeployment of that right one force,
*09:41.980- 09:48.660* :  some 8 to 10 kilometers away from the Israel border, together with Israel, perhaps with
*09:48.660- 09:55.000* :  drawing from some disputed points along the border. So the road one forces and their command
*09:55.000- 10:00.600* :  structure have been at the heart of the cross-border fire that Israel has been a target of,
*10:00.600- 10:05.080* :  and very much at the center of the negotiations and the deal that the U.S. is trying to broker.
*10:05.300- 10:13.880* :  How long has Akeel been a member of Hasbola, and what sort of operations has he been involved in
*10:13.880- 10:21.660* :  in the past? I understand that there was some involvement by him in the 1983 bombings in Beirut
*10:21.660- 10:30.080* :  of U.S. targets. Akeel is wanted by the U.S. He had been there from day one in terms of
*10:30.280- 10:36.880* :  Hasbola's formation back when it was called the Islamic Jihad, really the early days of Hasbola,
*10:37.440- 10:43.580* :  and he is one of two, and perhaps even actually the last member of that Jihadi council,
*10:43.580- 10:50.380* :  that sort of top council of Hasbola that was still alive. So Tommy lived a bit more about his
*10:50.380- 10:57.940* :  involvement in those 1983 bombings in Beirut. What we do know is that he was involved in
*10:57.940- 11:03.760* :  planning and in carrying out those attacks against the marine barracks in Beirut, but it did
*11:03.760- 11:12.820* :  result in the loss of a large number of American lives. Some 230, 240 Marines are believed to have
*11:12.820- 11:18.360* :  lost their lives as a result of that operation, and it led, I must say, to an eventual withdrawal
*11:19.040- 11:25.500* :  of the multinational force which the U.S. and France had been spearheading to try and bring the
*11:25.500- 11:30.960* :  Lebanese Civil War to some kind of a close. Feroz Maksadeh, senior fellow at the Middle East
*11:30.960- 11:37.660* :  Institute in Washington. Later, the UN Security Council met in New York to discuss the crisis
*11:37.660- 11:43.900* :  in the Middle East after four days of intensive Israeli attacks on Hasbola. The organization's
*11:43.900- 11:48.900* :  human rights chief, Falkerturk, said he was appalled by what he called the indiscriminate targeting
*11:48.900- 11:54.280* :  of thousands of people in Lebanon through the explosions of communication devices, and said it
*11:54.280- 12:00.520* :  violated international law. International humanitarian law prohibits the use of booby trap devices
*12:01.120- 12:06.940* :  in the form of apparently harmless portable objects which are specifically designed and constructed
*12:06.940- 12:14.820* :  to contain explosive material. It is a war crime to commit violence intended to spread terror
*12:14.820- 12:21.000* :  among civilians. I call again for an independent thorough and transparent investigation
*12:21.340- 12:26.920* :  into the circumstances of these explosions. Those who ordered and carried out these attacks
*12:26.920- 12:33.100* :  must be held to account. The Undersecretary General for Political Affairs Rosemary Decalo
*12:33.100- 12:39.220* :  said that it wasn't too late for diplomacy. The risk to security and stability, not only in Lebanon,
*12:39.260- 12:46.320* :  but also in the region, could not be clearer or graver. The Secretary General has already expressed
*12:46.320- 12:52.300* :  his deep alarm over these events. I echo his sentiments and strongly urge all actors
*12:52.940- 12:58.660* :  to exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation. Rosemary Decalo
*12:59.800- 13:05.100* :  The United States has described footage that appears to show Israeli soldiers shoving apparently
*13:05.100- 13:12.280* :  lifeless bodies from a rooftop in the occupied West Bank as deeply disturbing. The National Security
*13:12.280- 13:17.980* :  Council spokesman John Kirby said Washington had demanded an explanation from Israel and that
*13:17.980- 13:24.540* :  the video appeared to depict apparent and egregious behaviour by professional soldiers. The video
*13:24.540- 13:31.640* :  was filmed following an exchange of fire in the city of Kabataya on Thursday. Zakaria Zakane,
*13:31.640- 13:36.160* :  whose nephew was among those killed, described his horror at what he'd seen.
*13:39.640- 13:44.780* :  How does it feel to be an uncle watching the body of your nephew being mutilated?
*13:45.660- 13:51.280* :  What pain will I live with? What will be the scene? And what will be the last picture of them in my
*13:51.280- 13:57.360* :  head? I will never forget this. The IDF has ordered an investigation into the incident.
*13:57.360- 14:00.120* :  Yolann Nell, who's in Jerusalem, has more details.
*14:00.760- 14:06.140* :  The disturbing videos show Israeli soldiers dragging three bodies across a roof and dropping
*14:06.140- 14:11.380* :  them off the edge. A military bulldozer then appears to pick up and remove the corpses.
*14:12.080- 14:17.960* :  The Palestinian Authority says the footage shows a crime which exposes the brutality of the Israeli
*14:17.960- 14:24.180* :  army. In response, the Israeli military said this was a serious incident that did not conform to
*14:24.180- 14:30.500* :  its values and what was expected of its forces. Under international law, soldiers are obliged to
*14:30.500- 14:36.660* :  ensure that bodies, including of enemy fighters, are treated with respect. Israel's military says it
*14:36.660- 14:42.520* :  carried out a counter-terrorism operation in Kabataya, which included attacking a car with a drone.
*14:42.520- 14:48.220* :  A journalist in the town told the BBC that Israeli undercover troops had surrounded a building.
*14:48.220- 14:53.360* :  Four men who were inside then escaped the roof and were shot by snipers, he said.
*14:54.000- 14:58.680* :  There's been a surge in deadly violence in the West Bank since Hamas's attack on Israel
*14:58.680- 15:02.860* :  last October, which triggered the war in Gaza. Yolann Nell.
*15:03.560- 15:09.120* :  Now to other news. A new report by the U.S. Secret Service over the shooting of Donald Trump
*15:09.120- 15:14.820* :  at a rally in July has found that a series of communication breakdowns hampered its operations
*15:14.820- 15:21.000* :  in protecting the former president. The acting director, Ronald Roe, Jr. admitted that the
*15:21.000- 15:26.100* :  security planning around the rally involved complacency and communication deficiencies.
*15:26.540- 15:29.460* :  This was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service.
*15:29.920- 15:33.440* :  It's important that we hold ourselves accountable and that we use the lessons learned
*15:33.440- 15:38.080* :  to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again. We need a shift
*15:38.080- 15:43.020* :  and how we conduct our productive operations. The Secret Service did not give clear guidance
*15:43.020- 15:48.420* :  or direction to our local law enforcement partners. There were communication deficiencies
*15:48.420- 15:53.400* :  between law enforcement personnel at the site. For more on the failings, here's our North America
*15:53.400- 15:58.760* :  correspondent John Sudworth. The use of different radio frequencies by the local police and the
*15:58.760- 16:03.540* :  Secret Service meant that Mr. Trump's close protection team weren't aware that the alarm
*16:03.540- 16:08.880* :  about a suspicious person had already been raised. Had they been, the review says they may have
*16:08.880- 16:13.220* :  been able to move him out of harm's way. At a press conference, outlining the findings,
*16:13.220- 16:18.220* :  the acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald Roe spoke of a heightened threat environment
*16:18.220- 16:22.120* :  following the second apparent assassination attempt this weekend in Florida.
*16:22.120- 16:26.620* :  And of the need for the agency to undergo what he called a paradigm shift.
*16:26.620- 16:33.100* :  John Sudworth. Voting season in the US has officially kicked off as people in three states lined
*16:33.100- 16:38.800* :  up on Friday at early voting polling sites or election offices to cast their ballots.
*16:38.800- 16:43.980* :  The junior was the first state to offer their voters that option. Minnesota and South Dakota
*16:43.980- 16:49.740* :  will also allow absentee ballots to be cast in person rather than by post. Our correspondent
*16:49.740- 16:53.400* :  Ioni Wells talked to voters, killing up in Fairfax, Virginia.
*16:53.880- 16:57.160* :  There are still more than six weeks to go until the presidential election date,
*16:57.160- 17:02.340* :  but millions of people in the US will cast their ballots early, some by post and some at early
*17:02.340- 17:07.300* :  in-person voting sites like this one in Virginia. We're voting early to make sure that our
*17:07.300- 17:11.120* :  vote is counted. We're voting early because we really wanted to make sure that we
*17:11.560- 17:15.720* :  got out here on the first day. It's exciting. And also we're going to be out of the country
*17:15.720- 17:19.420* :  on election day. From a civic duty perspective, early was better.
*17:19.800- 17:23.640* :  I mean, you don't know what the weather is going to be like. So you just come out. It's a nice day,
*17:23.640- 17:30.200* :  why not? Early voting is the thing now. So here I am. I think most people have decided who they want.
*17:30.200- 17:34.860* :  They've seen where the country is going and where it's been and what they want. I think a lot of
*17:34.860- 17:39.600* :  people have already decided. Nearly 40% of the total votes in Virginia was cast early at the
*17:39.600- 17:44.700* :  last presidential election. Voters in two other states, Minnesota and South Dakota will also have
*17:44.700- 17:50.620* :  the opportunity from Friday to hand in absentee ballots in person instead of posting them. Virginia has
*17:50.620- 17:54.940* :  been a reliably blue Democrat state in the last few elections, but some Republicans have been
*17:54.940- 17:59.520* :  bullish about trying to flip it. Voters will also be casting a vote for the state's members of
*17:59.520- 18:06.780* :  Congress and one of its two senators. I only wells. Biodegradable sanitary pads, child safe,
*18:06.780- 18:12.620* :  cooking stoves and an app that stops online bullying in its tracks. There's just three of the
*18:12.620- 18:19.360* :  scores of new inventions and ideas unveiled in Montreal, Canada. The one young world summit
*18:20.020- 18:25.600* :  brings together future young leaders from more than 190 countries to tackle themes like peace,
*18:25.640- 18:31.600* :  AI and the environment. The BBC's Jacob Evans was at the event opening ceremony.
*18:32.360- 18:39.960* :  From the Bell Centre, home of the Montreal Canadian, welcome to the one young world summit
*18:39.960- 18:49.560* :  2024 opening ceremony. More than 2000 delegates, many in national costume and proudly waving
*18:49.560- 18:54.980* :  their flags took to the stage. The all-singing, all-dancing celebration kicked off a three-day summit
*18:55.440- 19:01.020* :  where people aged between 18 and 35 share their ideas, their solutions and ambitions for a better
*19:01.020- 19:06.300* :  future. One of them, Hannah Raviti, Mike Piclark, traveled here from New Zealand to pick up her
*19:06.300- 19:11.800* :  award as the young politician of the year. Very humbled, um, for us is a saying,
*19:11.880- 19:17.360* :  Kure Tekumarae Kuretomo-Tonakirika, which means the sweet potato will never say how sweet it is,
*19:17.880- 19:24.460* :  so I'm accepting this award not for myself but for the people around me who've raised me.
*19:25.460- 19:30.640* :  Another celebrated participant is Patricia Zanella from Brazil. She's created her country's first
*19:30.640- 19:37.360* :  100% biodegradable sanitary pad. This is the most exciting about it. The difference is that
*19:37.360- 19:46.580* :  he didn't take 500 years to decompose. Just six months, we were able to do this using raw materials
*19:46.580- 19:53.960* :  from Brazil. All the process is really natural and all the fibers are hypoallergenic.
*19:54.820- 19:59.100* :  The summit is the brainchild of Kate Robertson and David Jones, who've harnessed some celebrity
*19:59.100- 20:03.340* :  sparkle from the likes of the singer and movie star Cher, the author, Margaret Atwood,
*20:03.340- 20:08.220* :  Live Aid's Bob Geldoff, and even Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. David Jones,
*20:08.220- 20:11.140* :  as he and Kate have the highest of hopes for the young participants.
*20:11.860- 20:16.040* :  If you come to One Young World, you sort of see the power and its impact, so we've impacted 50
*20:16.040- 20:21.300* :  million lives. Kate always used to say, you know, if we get it right, the future Mandela will
*20:21.300- 20:25.660* :  have come through One Young World and be a One Young World Ambassador, so if we've got the great
*20:25.660- 20:30.240* :  leaders of the world having been One Young World Ambassadors, if you have countries not going to
*20:30.260- 20:34.520* :  wall because they met here, the world doesn't need another youth conference, but it needs impact
*20:34.520- 20:40.100* :  and action, and so that that obsessive focus on scaling our impact. Many of the young people here
*20:40.100- 20:45.440* :  have refused to be defined by their early hardships. Take Charlotte Magui, orphaned at 10 and a
*20:45.440- 20:50.420* :  single mother by 16, she dropped out of school. But when her child was badly burned on a traditional
*20:50.420- 20:55.800* :  Kenyan cooking stove in their slum, she was motivated to act. Her child-friendly stovs can now be
*20:55.800- 21:01.740* :  found in two million homes across Kenya. Initially I just wanted to build a more stable stove to
*21:01.740- 21:06.440* :  limit the risk of bouncing children under the age of five, and while doing more research on that
*21:06.440- 21:12.120* :  was when I realised that, you know, household revolution and high cost fuel were also a factor,
*21:12.700- 21:17.720* :  and I needed to solve all three, so then I went on ahead and designed a stove that would then go
*21:17.720- 21:23.320* :  and solve three problems. The overarching theme here is one of courage and determination to
*21:23.320- 21:28.560* :  reject the status quo, an ambition to rewrite the rules, to create a society they want to inhabit,
*21:29.140- 21:35.180* :  and to act collectively and learn from one another. My name is Jedida Rakhwar, I'm from Kenya. I hope
*21:35.180- 21:41.360* :  that going back home strived and I get motivation to put in the work moving forward and create an
*21:41.360- 21:46.780* :  impact in the class. Malolilay, my name is Sociodiland Bawafi, and I am from the Kingdom of Tonga.
*21:46.980- 21:53.040* :  Yeah, I came here basically to learn about how to improve social impacts for my people back home
*21:53.400- 21:58.580* :  and across the Pacific. My name is Tristan Snyder, and I am from Shawanaka First Nation,
*21:58.700- 22:03.020* :  one thing that has been really resonating with me is really the power of connection here,
*22:03.220- 22:07.800* :  but how those lasting connections will be leaving even after this event finishes.
*22:09.400- 22:11.760* :  Jacob Evans in the Canadian City of Montreal.
*22:14.120- 22:18.860* :  Still to come. This deal may mark something of a makeover for Three Mile Island, which often
*22:18.860- 22:24.360* :  shares space with Chernobyl and Fukushima in the popular imagination. Three Mile Island scene
*22:24.360- 22:30.420* :  of the worst US nuclear accident is being reopened to power Microsoft's data centers.
*22:38.500- 22:41.460* :  Explaining football to the friend who's just there for the nachos?
*22:42.000- 22:46.600* :  Hard. Tailgating from home like a pro with snacks and drinks everyone will love,
*22:47.140- 22:51.640* :  any easy win. And with Instacart helping deliver the snack time MVP's to your door,

*23:11.900- 23:17.100* :  everything going up during inflation, we thought we'd bring our prices down. So to help us,

*23:44.020- 23:48.800* :  It's early autumn in the northern hemisphere and most schools are returning for a new term,
*23:49.500- 23:54.080* :  but not in the West African nation of Niger. None of the schools there have reopened because
*23:54.080- 23:59.120* :  weeks of heavy rain and floods have damaged classrooms and left displaced people using
*23:59.120- 24:04.440* :  school buildings for shelter. Our Africa regional editor will roast, hold me more.
*24:05.060- 24:09.380* :  Niger is an incredibly poor country, so if you go into the rural areas,
*24:10.020- 24:14.320* :  you'll find in the villages that a lot of the homes are made using very basic material,
*24:14.460- 24:19.760* :  mud walls, and some of those homes have just been completely washed away.
*24:19.760- 24:26.280* :  And in fact, the government is talking about 95,000 homes across the country that have been
*24:26.280- 24:31.520* :  destroyed and they're now having to give out a lot of food aid because people are displaced.
*24:31.520- 24:37.720* :  They're not able to be near where they farm, but of course the other problem is a lot of farmland
*24:37.720- 24:43.180* :  has gone with this flooding. So there's a kind of a double problem, but certainly some of the people
*24:43.180- 24:48.240* :  who are talking about what's happened are saying that these rains were far worse than
*24:48.240- 24:52.800* :  than they'd experienced in recent years. To the outsider, we normally associate Niger
*24:52.800- 25:00.160* :  with drought and desertification, and yet this is evidence that there are far more volatile weather
*25:00.160- 25:07.080* :  patterns of all different types. Yeah, we've had frequent droughts where crops completely fail,
*25:07.080- 25:12.460* :  and then there's a real food crisis, and Niger has had many of those. And what's been happening
*25:12.460- 25:21.300* :  in these countries, very dry, arid areas on the Sahel region, every year really people are seeing
*25:21.300- 25:29.200* :  it just getting harder and harder because of the dryness during those dry periods and so many
*25:29.200- 25:34.520* :  crops failing. And that's making life for the farmers incredibly difficult. And then, as you say,
*25:34.520- 25:41.600* :  on the other extreme, you get these extraordinary torrential downpours that go on for a long time and
*25:41.600- 25:47.840* :  cause a different kind of havoc for the people. So they are kind of between the two, and they're
*25:47.840- 25:52.040* :  lurching from droughts to floods. And we're seeing that in other parts of the continent as well.
*25:52.740- 25:58.360* :  The thing about schools closing is that school is a safe environment for young people, supposedly.
*25:58.360- 26:04.360* :  If people aren't in school, the danger potentially is that jihadist groups will prey on individuals.
*26:04.980- 26:10.300* :  Well, certainly there have been cases, you know, there's evidence that not just in Niger,
*26:10.300- 26:15.480* :  but in other areas just across the border in northeast Nigeria, it's the kind of lack of
*26:15.480- 26:21.100* :  opportunities for young people that is driving them into the hands of these jihadist groups. So
*26:21.100- 26:27.180* :  young people who before might have felt they had a chance of earning a living either off the land
*26:27.180- 26:32.400* :  or moving to one of the nearby towns or cities are suddenly finding either the cost of living is
*26:32.400- 26:39.960* :  so high in the cities and be farming because of these climate problems is getting harder and harder.
*26:40.660- 26:46.020* :  Well, Ross, China has fortified its border with Myanmar by building
*26:46.020- 26:51.920* :  higher walls and holding military drills as the civil war on its doorstep threatens its investments
*26:51.920- 26:59.380* :  and its economy. Beijing has also dispatched its top diplomat Wang Yi to try to persuade Myanmar's
*26:59.380- 27:04.260* :  military rulers to return to peace talks and hold nationwide elections as promised.
*27:05.000- 27:10.160* :  Myanmar has been thrown into fresh chaos in recent months after a China broke its ceasefire
*27:10.160- 27:15.560* :  in the north of the country, fell apart. Armed ethnic groups have made huge gains, capturing key
*27:15.560- 27:21.540* :  cities and towns on the main road to China's border, which some believe could be a turning point
*27:21.540- 27:26.780* :  in this civil war. Our China correspondent Laura Bicca has this report from the Chinese border.
*27:28.980- 27:37.080* :  Jade necklace. Burmese jade traders in China beckon us to their stalls.
*27:39.900- 27:46.580* :  They're desperate for a sale, 70% of the world's jade comes from Myanmar and yet they tell us
*27:46.580- 27:54.200* :  the price has plummeted. Strict Covid lockdowns have ravaged this border economy and now the war
*27:54.200- 28:01.500* :  has blocked key trade routes into China. Beijing desperately needs stability if it's to rebuild
*28:01.500- 28:09.340* :  local businesses. Your countries at war just accept what I give you, shouts one Chinese man
*28:09.340- 28:20.620* :  haggling for a bargain. The local maize-like market has stalls brimming with other goods from milk tea
*28:20.620- 28:26.900* :  to tobacco. The few people that make it over the border to China are searching for peace. They
*28:26.900- 28:34.400* :  have hopes of prosperity. But stallholder Li Mianjian says it's hard to make a living when so many
*28:34.400- 28:44.660* :  here are just glad to be alive. It's really, really cruel. I don't know when things can start to
*28:45.660- 28:51.320* :  improve. I hope some decent people can tell our size to stop fighting so the ordinary people
*28:51.320- 28:58.200* :  can suffer less. Otherwise, it's really tragic for us. You know, the bombshells hit hospitals.
*28:58.300- 29:06.720* :  People were killed, including women giving birth there. For Myanmar families with the right
*29:06.720- 29:14.060* :  paperwork, the Chinese city of really has become a safe haven. From here in the middle of the
*29:14.160- 29:20.340* :  square in the Beijing Sun, I can see over the border into Myanmar scattered around the square
*29:21.340- 29:31.860* :  are mostly women with lots of their belongings. Some have their papers on the ground as they try to
*29:31.860- 29:40.680* :  get you work permit in order. Another border checkpoint. China fortified this once poorest border
*29:40.680- 29:44.840* :  during the pandemic building higher fences more checkpoint.
*29:48.640- 29:54.060* :  Loudspeakers still warn Chinese tourists to stay back from the high steel fence.
*29:58.940- 30:04.640* :  Just a few miles away armed insurgents have stepped up their fight against the military regime.
*30:04.640- 30:10.140* :  A Beijing brokered ceasefire was ripped apart and thousands have fled the fighting.
*30:15.420- 30:19.780* :  In response, China is holding regular military exercises along the border.
*30:19.780- 30:27.040* :  State media said this is to maintain order. Beijing also dispatched its top diplomat Wang Yi
*30:27.040- 30:31.180* :  to Myanmar to push military rulers to hold promised elections.
*30:36.540- 30:42.180* :  After long shifts making car parts and clothes, dozens of Burmese workers relax playing
*30:42.180- 30:47.780* :  volleyball. They've been brought from Myanmar as cheap labor for Chinese factories.
*30:51.600- 30:56.820* :  Zanong is 31 and fears he would have been forced to fight if he'd stayed.
*30:59.800- 31:06.140* :  There is nothing we can do because war is happening in Myanmar. Everything is expensive.
*31:06.900- 31:12.080* :  Everywhere there is a battle going on and everyone has to run because of war.
*31:13.200- 31:18.680* :  His work here comes with conditions. The movement of Burmese workers is often restricted
*31:20.940- 31:25.620* :  and enterprising locals have set up food and karaoke stalls to keep them entertained.
*31:29.340- 31:34.380* :  The future prospects of this town and these workers are in Chinese hands
*31:35.280- 31:40.520* :  as Beijing calculates just how big a part it's willing to play in Myanmar's feet.
*31:42.460- 31:48.560* :  That report by Laura Bicker. The owner of Three Mile Island, the site of America's worst
*31:48.560- 31:54.840* :  nuclear accident, says it plans to restart one of the reactors to provide energy for Microsoft.
*31:54.860- 32:01.400* :  If approved by regulators, the plant is slated to reopen in four years time. Will Leonardo reports?
*32:02.040- 32:06.380* :  This deal may mark something of a makeover for Three Mile Island, which often share space with
*32:06.380- 32:11.560* :  Chernobyl and Fukushima in the popular imagination. The 20-year agreement will see a reactor,
*32:11.560- 32:17.240* :  not the one involved in the 1979 partial meltdown, restarted to produce carbon-free power for
*32:17.240- 32:22.820* :  Microsoft's data centers. Three Mile Island is located near Washington, DC, where grids are facing
*32:22.820- 32:27.600* :  strain from the tech sector's voracious appetite for energy fueled by the AI revolution.
*32:28.240- 32:32.820* :  The plant's owner said the deal was a powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a
*32:32.820- 32:38.040* :  clean energy source. Microsoft says it hopes to feed the power to enable data center expansion
*32:38.040- 32:42.320* :  in Chicago, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Will Leonardo.
*32:43.620- 32:49.680* :  The actor who voiced many famous TV characters including Pepper Pig, Thunderbirds and Dr. Who
*32:49.680- 32:55.540* :  has died at the age of 99. David Graham terrified children all over the world when he played
*32:55.540- 33:00.900* :  the evil Daleks in Dr. Who, but he later warmed their hearts as Grandpa Pig.
*33:01.360- 33:04.560* :  Our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson looks back at his life.
*33:08.700- 33:14.740* :  Generations of children grew up listening to David Graham's voice. In the 1960s, he was Parker,
*33:15.120- 33:18.320* :  Lady Penelope's ever-sold loyal chauffeur. Yes, my lady.
*33:20.180- 33:26.260* :  Driving our pink Rolls-Royce in Thunderbirds, he told the BBC that the way Parker spoke was
*33:26.260- 33:31.780* :  based on a real wine waiter. It turned out that he'd been a retired member of the Royal Household.
*33:31.780- 33:35.160* :  I think he worked for the Duke of Windsor, and we asked him, you know what he thought,
*33:35.580- 33:41.640* :  who is a real gent, you know, they don't make them like that anymore, and we just embroider them.
*33:41.640- 33:47.920* :  We are the masters of the earth. He also voiced the Daleks and early Dr. Who, alongside his friend
*33:47.920- 33:54.640* :  Peter Hawkins. Last year, at the age of 98, he returned to provide new Dalek dialogue for a
*33:54.640- 34:04.180* :  restored, colorized version of the original Dalek story. And 20 years ago, he landed a rather
*34:04.180- 34:11.560* :  less menacing role that would run and run. Hello! The voice of Grandpa Pig in Peppa Pig.
*34:11.560- 34:17.640* :  Let's watch them television. David Graham said it was a joy that voice over work had allowed him
*34:17.640- 34:23.000* :  to extend an acting career, which included him being a member of Sir Lawrence Olivier's company
*34:23.520- 34:24.540* :  at the National Theatre.
*34:27.980- 34:32.740* :  Colin Patterson on the life of the actor David Graham, who's just died at the age of 99.
*34:35.360- 34:39.280* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
