*01:25.680- 01:31.560* :  single story in-depth with insight from the BBC's best journalists. There's a new edition every

*01:47.380- 01:55.440* :  Today was the price literally of U.S. democracy. If the 2024 election has so far been
*01:55.440- 02:01.560* :  defined by unexpected twists and surprise turns, there's one thing that was always certain.
*02:01.560- 02:08.480* :  It costs a lot of money. Across all the races being decided in November, the political parties will
*02:08.480- 02:15.700* :  spend not millions but billions of dollars on the campaigns. From yard signs to TV ads and
*02:15.700- 02:23.280* :  consultants and stadium rallies, all of it adds up. We ask what influence does all that money have,
*02:23.640- 02:30.200* :  not just on the success of election campaigns, but on actual politics and democracy in the United
*02:30.200- 02:40.340* :  States. So we've got loads to get into today and helping me to answer all of our questions are
*02:40.340- 02:45.760* :  correspondent in Washington DC, Anthony Serca. Hello. Hi there, how are you doing? And Matthew
*02:45.760- 02:50.340* :  Foster from the Department of Government at the American University, also in Washington DC,
*02:50.780- 02:57.120* :  and you have kindly allowed me to call you Matt today. Hello. Hi, glad to be here. Now this really
*02:57.120- 03:01.480* :  is an issue of huge interest to our listeners wherever they are in the world.
*03:27.540- 03:33.460* :  Okay, before we go any further though, what sums are we talking about? How huge are they?
*03:33.460- 03:37.200* :  I think we have a complete figure from the last election campaign. Don't we back in 2020?
*03:37.820- 03:41.940* :  Okay, you're going to put me on a spot here, but I'm going to say it's about $16 billion or
*03:41.940- 03:47.080* :  they're about. It's a massive amount, although when you look at how much money is spent on say
*03:47.080- 03:51.980* :  dog food advertising or other advertising, corporate advertising, you know, America is a big country,
*03:51.980- 03:57.180* :  so it does cost money to get a message out. All the same though. I mean, with that $16 billion
*03:57.180- 04:03.300* :  figure, there are about 50 countries in the world whose entire GDP is less than $16 billion. So
*04:03.680- 04:09.760* :  that puts it a bit in perspective. Matt, how do Americans as a whole in this huge country
*04:09.760- 04:15.700* :  feel about those kind of figures though? Because we hear so much in the US, like in many parts of the
*04:15.700- 04:20.940* :  world, concerns about cost of living, about inflation levels. And yet at the same time, they're
*04:20.940- 04:26.820* :  hearing these astronomical amounts being spent on a political campaign. That is one of the biggest
*04:26.820- 04:32.160* :  questions, just the sheer amount of waste in all of this. So when we have homeless crises, when we're
*04:32.160- 04:37.740* :  always talking about budgets, I'm always having to cut healthcare and education, is this really
*04:37.740- 04:45.380* :  representing the values to spend $16 billion per election cycle? So I mean, that leads to the question
*04:45.380- 04:52.140* :  where is the money coming from? Anthony, is there a sense then from Americans who are finding it
*04:52.140- 04:58.440* :  difficult to reach the end of the month with the money that they have that politics is decided
*04:58.440- 05:04.860* :  by the rich in the United States? Obviously, the wealthy and the super wealthy do have an
*05:04.860- 05:10.900* :  outsized, say, an American politics because of the way American campaign finance law has been
*05:10.900- 05:16.080* :  organized in a way it's been shaped by Supreme Court decisions in recent years. You have very
*05:16.080- 05:21.780* :  wealthy donors who can spend hundreds of millions of dollars and donate them to committees that
*05:22.180- 05:26.300* :  while they are not directly associated with presidential candidates or not supposed to be at least,
*05:26.660- 05:31.640* :  they can spend money on political races and they spend lots of money on political races,
*05:31.640- 05:38.800* :  they can support individual candidates. So they do have a lot of say, but if you also look at where a
*05:38.800- 05:44.220* :  lot of this money comes from, a lot of it does come from smaller donors and I mean thousands of
*05:44.220- 05:49.740* :  dollars per person that are the limits that they can give to political candidates. And so, you know,
*05:49.740- 05:55.160* :  to get up to that big billions of dollars number, it's not just the super wealthy, it's the fact
*05:55.160- 05:59.720* :  that America is a big country and there are a lot of people who are engaged in politics and a lot
*05:59.720- 06:05.420* :  of candidates, a lot of the successful candidates recently have been able to tap into the millions
*06:05.420- 06:10.220* :  of Americans who donate money and bring all of these small donations together. You've seen that
*06:10.220- 06:13.700* :  with Kamala Harris running for president for the Democrats recently. You've seen that with Donald
*06:13.700- 06:19.960* :  Trump as well. He has a massive grassroots fundraising effort. And you know, we're talking about
*06:19.960- 06:24.120* :  the presidential race, but I'm wondering Matt does it also affect local politics that parties
*06:24.600- 06:29.680* :  may also favor candidates who can fund themselves basically so that there isn't a problem and again,
*06:29.680- 06:35.060* :  then sort of skewering politics towards those who have money. I wouldn't say necessarily that the
*06:35.060- 06:40.200* :  parties are looking for kind of a wealthy self-funding candidates. I think the wealthy self-funding
*06:40.200- 06:44.800* :  candidates are the ones that kind of stick out that can win primaries, but you're absolutely right,
*06:44.800- 06:49.460* :  though. Money and fundraising is the oxygen of campaigns, especially at like the congressional level.
*06:49.860- 06:56.380* :  And the parties and the donors that are close to these parties really are the ones the
*06:56.380- 07:03.740* :  key makers in determining whether this candidate can have a chance or not. That's always been a big
*07:03.740- 07:10.260* :  complaint about our primary system and the money that is really difficult for less well-known
*07:10.260- 07:16.940* :  candidates with less access to money to kind of win those primaries and get on the ticket and then
*07:16.940- 07:20.900* :  get the full support of the party because once the primaries over, these parties, if it's going to
*07:20.900- 07:25.240* :  be competitive, are going to put their money into a race if they can win. So some of your
*07:25.240- 07:28.980* :  memories here is that if you're running for Congress and you win, you basically just have to start
*07:28.980- 07:33.520* :  fundraising for the next election as soon as you get an office. And I think that's the biggest
*07:33.520- 07:38.520* :  advantage to people who are self-funded is that they don't quite have to do as much of that. But
*07:38.780- 07:42.340* :  you know, I've talked to members of Congress and they complain about it all the time. They get to
*07:42.340- 07:47.520* :  Washington. They're here to govern, right? They're here to do things and pass legislation. And then
*07:47.520- 07:53.300* :  their party says and their campaign, their campaign staff says, okay, for three hours a day, every
*07:53.300- 07:58.360* :  morning you have to go sit in a windowless room and make phone calls to donors to get more money.
*07:58.660- 08:01.920* :  So two years from now, if you're in the house or six years from now, if you're in the Senate,
*08:02.420- 08:08.440* :  you can run for election and win again. So it is a massive, not just, you know, resources but time,
*08:08.440- 08:13.160* :  which for a lot of politicians is the most precious resource. One thing that I always hear,
*08:13.520- 08:19.200* :  my wife was a campaign manager and fundraiser and just from everybody involved in politics,
*08:19.200- 08:22.840* :  especially those in campaign managers. The best candidate is the one that's hitting the phones.
*08:22.840- 08:27.400* :  The best candidate is the one that's fundraising. Roughly speaking, what kind of sense do you get
*08:27.400- 08:33.320* :  Anthony of how much time Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are spending at the moment on the campaign
*08:33.320- 08:38.060* :  trail and trying to ramp up those funds? Hi, there are two things they're doing. One, they're going to
*08:38.060- 08:44.460* :  these key battleground states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina,
*08:44.460- 08:48.860* :  Nevada, because that's where this presidential election is going to be decided. So if you look
*08:48.880- 08:53.360* :  Kamala Harris' schedule, if you look at Donald Trump's schedule, they're hitting these states three or
*08:53.360- 08:59.060* :  four times a week. And then there are other stops they make, you know, they go to California,
*08:59.060- 09:04.220* :  they go to Florida, they go to Texas, they go to New York, and those trips are not to court voters,
*09:04.640- 09:10.740* :  those trips are to hold fundraisers and because that's how they get the money. So it's a balance for
*09:11.280- 09:16.400* :  both candidates to the balance between actually meeting voters, actually showing up in the states
*09:16.400- 09:23.060* :  in matter and showing up at these lavish parties where the high rolling donors all show up and
*09:23.320- 09:27.060* :  not just donors who are giving money, but people who are raising money for them, they're called
*09:27.060- 09:31.360* :  bundlers. So these are people who say, okay, I'm going to give you money and they're limits the amount
*09:31.360- 09:37.780* :  of money they can give directly to a candidate. But I have 100, 500, a thousand really wealthy
*09:37.780- 09:43.280* :  friends and all of my friends, I'm going to convince to also give $3,000, which is a limit to
*09:43.280- 09:48.560* :  the candidates. And those people are essential to funding campaigns. So you can see it's a kind of
*09:48.560- 09:53.960* :  a division of time. But if you look at the candidates, they're traveling about half the week,
*09:53.960- 09:58.320* :  Donald Trump maybe a little less Kamala Harris a little more because she kind of had to start from
*09:58.320- 10:03.780* :  a standstill back in July. Of course, she started from a standstill, as you say, but there was like
*10:03.780- 10:08.800* :  a rush of donations towards her when she did take over as a democratic candidate. I just wanted to
*10:08.800- 10:14.140* :  just stop for a second, Anthony, just to go back to what you have been alluding to repeatedly,
*10:14.140- 10:21.260* :  that there are rules in place about donations. There are things called packs, for example. Could
*10:21.260- 10:25.400* :  you briefly outline for us what those rules are? And most importantly, what I want to know is,
*10:25.900- 10:30.180* :  are those rules kept to or do the lines get a bit blurry in the end of the day?
*10:30.720- 10:36.240* :  There are rules, but the lines have gotten very blurry recently. Congress has attempted to
*10:36.500- 10:42.560* :  regulate campaign finance since the 1970s. And the way they've done that is to make limits on the
*10:42.560- 10:49.000* :  amount of money that individuals can donate and corporations can donate to candidates. So like I
*10:49.000- 10:53.500* :  said, there's a $3,000 limit, I believe, on the amount of money you can give per election to a
*10:53.500- 10:58.660* :  candidate committee. You can also give, I think it's $5,000 to political action committees that are
*10:58.660- 11:03.260* :  directly affiliated with candidates. So you can give money, but that's, yeah, that's packs.
*11:03.300- 11:09.820* :  That's the cap on that. There's no limit to the amount that campaigns can spend and candidates
*11:09.820- 11:14.460* :  can spend as long as they raise the money. They can opt into certain limits at the presidential
*11:14.460- 11:20.960* :  level, but the Supreme Court has ruled from very early on that spending money is equivalent of speech
*11:20.980- 11:25.560* :  and government can't regulate how much money can spend because that's regulating free speech,
*11:25.580- 11:30.580* :  and that's protecting the Constitution. Now, there's a big hole that got blown into this back
*11:30.580- 11:35.920* :  in 2010, which after some congressional attempts to limit money that was spent not directly to
*11:35.920- 11:41.720* :  candidates, but on issues and advocating for candidates, independent of candidates. The Supreme
*11:41.720- 11:47.440* :  Court said, no, you can't put limits on what just average billionaires can spend talking about
*11:47.440- 11:52.560* :  issues or talking about candidates, because again, spending money is speech. My name is David Vossi,
*11:52.560- 11:58.400* :  I'm president of Citizens United. It's a monumental victory for Citizens United, and more importantly
*11:58.400- 12:03.720* :  for the First Amendment and the fundamental rights of people to participate in the political process
*12:04.320- 12:08.980* :  and the marketplace of ideas, whether you're an individual, whether you're a corporation,
*12:09.540- 12:16.740* :  or a union, it doesn't matter. You can now participate fully and freely in the election process.
*12:17.080- 12:23.100* :  I'm president of Common Cause, working with public campaign and public citizen and whole group
*12:23.100- 12:30.500* :  of people who are outraged by this decision. It is the super bowl of bad decisions. Corporations
*12:30.500- 12:37.660* :  aren't individuals. There's some of them are larger than countries. We need to recognize that
*12:37.660- 12:44.680* :  money has influenced the debate here in Washington for too long. You have these committees that are
*12:44.680- 12:48.800* :  super PACs are independent of the campaigns, and they're not supposed to coordinate. They're not
*12:48.800- 12:52.480* :  supposed to work with the campaigns, but they can raise all the money they want. They're funded by
*12:52.480- 12:56.860* :  hundreds of millions of dollars from billionaires, and they can start running advertisements saying
*12:56.860- 13:03.260* :  vote for X or vote against candidate Y, or this issue abortion, or the environment, or taxes,
*13:03.780- 13:07.960* :  or crime. This issue is important that this should be what you decide to vote on, and that's why
*13:07.960- 13:13.080* :  you've seen this kind of flood of money into American politics, particularly in the last 14 years,
*13:13.860- 13:18.800* :  and the lack of any kind of control to loophole that lets billionaires really do have an
*13:18.800- 13:23.340* :  outsized say in American politics, at least on the airways and at least in campaigns.
*13:24.480- 13:29.080* :  So we've looked at these massive fundraising machines that are bringing in hundreds of millions
*13:29.080- 13:36.060* :  of dollars for Trump and for Harris, but how is it all spent, and what impact might it have on
*13:36.060- 13:36.920* :  the election result?

*15:14.600- 15:20.180* :  My guiding lights today are correspondent in Washington DC Anthony Circa and Matthew
*15:20.180- 15:25.900* :  Foster from the Department of Government at the American University. I'd love to paint a picture
*15:25.900- 15:31.240* :  together of how the big bucks are raised. Could you take us by the hand and bring us into one of
*15:31.240- 15:37.540* :  these big fundraising events fundraising dinners and paint us a picture of what's going on there?
*15:38.120- 15:43.960* :  Who's that? Look, these fundraising dinners are there to kind of both get the money but also
*15:44.380- 15:50.140* :  attract the news cycle. They're revealing these big numbers and it's more of another PR campaign.
*15:50.140- 15:55.160* :  It's another way to kind of really get on the radar and say, oh, look how well we're doing.
*15:55.160- 16:01.240* :  But yes, these big dollar fundraisers range from kind of celebrities of its California to all the
*16:01.240- 16:06.680* :  local politicians to even sometimes campaign workers and giving them a little bit of thrill to come
*16:06.680- 16:13.580* :  there. It's really just an opportunity to see the candidate kind of feel that you're important
*16:13.580- 16:18.740* :  and people do it because of all the buzz around it. Now most events for fundraising are not
*16:18.740- 16:24.600* :  this glamorous thing. If we get to the nitty-gritty of like lower level races, these tend to be simple
*16:24.600- 16:29.980* :  kind of gatherings where you have like a cheese platter from the supermarket and you're just
*16:29.980- 16:35.300* :  fundraising there. You're crashing my dreams here Matt. I'm thinking about, you know, the pop stars
*16:35.300- 16:41.260* :  and presenters of Saturday night live and selfies with the presidential candidates. I don't want
*16:41.260- 16:47.600* :  to cheese platter. Yeah, and those happen but they're far and few in between these big dollar dinners.
*16:47.900- 16:51.960* :  Most of the time they aren't this glamorous thing and I think Hollywood definitely portrays politics
*16:51.960- 16:57.900* :  in such a more glamorous life and I could tell you that these galas and all these events are not what
*16:57.900- 17:02.300* :  we imagine what we see on TV. Yeah, they take many shapes and sizes and I've been to all different
*17:02.300- 17:05.780* :  sorts of ones. They're the ones that you do hear about in the Hollywood and George Clooney
*17:06.100- 17:10.360* :  throwing that big fundraiser for Joe Biden that he later wrote about and said Joe Biden was kind
*17:10.360- 17:15.860* :  of out of it and that became a criticism of him. That was in California. There are some they
*17:15.860- 17:21.680* :  rented out a theater in New York City and held a fundraiser there but then I've also been to
*17:21.680- 17:27.920* :  ones that are in people's living rooms and houses. Even Donald Trump, I was following him in 2019
*17:27.920- 17:34.280* :  and he took a trip to New Orleans and there was a kind of a lavish big house in New Orleans
*17:34.280- 17:39.340* :  outside of New Orleans where Donald Trump showed up and there were wealthy donors there.
*17:39.340- 17:43.940* :  Any mingled those in the press were kept in the separate room we came in saw him briefly but
*17:44.420- 17:48.280* :  just someone's house and you have the president of the United States and just in someone's house.
*17:48.660- 17:52.640* :  And there are some quite creative ways that we've seen candidates bringing in the dollars.
*17:52.640- 17:57.560* :  Obviously predicts to be Donald Trump colorful ideas with a Trump trading card.
*17:58.200- 18:03.860* :  50 all new stunning digital trading cards it's really something. These cards show me dancing
*18:03.860- 18:08.800* :  and even me holding some bitcoins. The Harris campaign okay I mean she only has short notice
*18:08.800- 18:14.800* :  we've got some caps t-shirts mugs. Y'all this is not a drill the America is an idea shirt is
*18:15.260- 18:20.960* :  actually in stock and I have basically been on the internet begging Kamala HQ to fix their website
*18:20.960- 18:25.920* :  because I don't want to donate money but I do want to buy merch. The two of you in your years
*18:25.920- 18:30.120* :  of political experience would have been some of the more outlandish campaign fundraising
*18:31.160- 18:37.000* :  methods that you've seen. As such as trading cards for Donald Trump he was giving pieces
*18:37.000- 18:43.140* :  of the suit he wore to that debate with Joe Biden at the end of June like little little cuts
*18:43.140- 18:48.080* :  of cloth that if you bought a certain number of trading cards. And people are calling it the knockout
*18:48.080- 18:52.980* :  suit I don't know about that but that's what they're calling it. So we'll cut up the knockout
*18:52.980- 18:58.860* :  suit and you're going to get a piece of it. There's all sorts of different kinds of swag now and all
*18:58.860- 19:03.040* :  sorts of different kinds of knick knacks you can you can get with with the candidates name on
*19:03.040- 19:08.000* :  that for donating and I think that's been actually a bigger part of campaigning now is the campaign
*19:08.000- 19:13.180* :  shop where you can buy t-shirts and things like that it used to just be bumper stickers and buttons
*19:13.300- 19:18.280* :  but we have come a long way from that now and I think the swag is twofold right it's one way
*19:18.280- 19:24.640* :  to generate some money and then it's not a substantial way let's be honest but it serves as a way
*19:24.640- 19:27.680* :  to the kind of advertise for your campaign it's a free way to get your name out.
*19:31.900- 19:35.800* :  We've got all these billions of dollars all this money is being is being raised small donations
*19:35.860- 19:42.500* :  huge donations Anthony how has it then spent and is there a difference between the Trump camp
*19:42.500- 19:47.820* :  and the Harris formally Biden camp? It's spent on a lot of different things but one of the big
*19:47.820- 19:54.120* :  things it's spent on is advertising because advertising is expensive to get a commercial a 60 set
*19:54.120- 20:00.220* :  commercial on television particularly in a major metropolitan area can cost hundreds of
*20:00.220- 20:06.360* :  thousands of dollars national television advertising campaign cost millions of dollars what you're
*20:06.360- 20:13.000* :  seeing now and not just advertising on television and radio you're seeing advertising online as well
*20:13.000- 20:18.500* :  so you're seeing advertising on social media you're seeing pop-up ads on different websites and
*20:18.500- 20:24.040* :  Kamala Harris is spending hundreds of billions of dollars on that. On the border the choice is simple
*20:24.040- 20:30.680* :  Kamala Harris supports increasing the number of Border Patrol agents Donald Trump blocked a bill
*20:30.680- 20:36.340* :  to increase the number of Border Patrol agents. Kamala Harris supports investing in new technology
*20:36.340- 20:42.080* :  to block fentanyl from entering the country. Donald Trump has as well. I'm Donald J Trump and I
*20:42.080- 20:48.800* :  approve this message this is American's borders are and she's failed us under Harris over 10
*20:48.800- 20:56.180* :  million illegally here a quarter of a million Americans dead. There's also a direct mail that
*20:56.240- 21:02.260* :  that people get so things in your in your mailbox that that are not only just advertising for the
*21:02.260- 21:07.740* :  candidate but fundraising pitches to generate more advertising so that's one component of it another
*21:07.740- 21:13.980* :  component is grassroots organizing that's paying campaign staff to be in these battleground states
*21:13.980- 21:20.460* :  that I talked about the ones in the Midwest the ones in the American Southwest and South East it's
*21:20.460- 21:25.680* :  getting them on the ground setting up renting offices renting campaign offices where they're
*21:25.680- 21:31.020* :  going to be sitting there making phone calls to voters organizing volunteers getting out and
*21:31.020- 21:37.680* :  knocking on doors in a close race voter outreach on the ground level still knocking on doors is
*21:37.680- 21:44.920* :  that still it is still the case it still matters especially in a close election turning out your
*21:44.920- 21:49.040* :  voters and making sure they get out there is important you're not knocking on doors necessarily
*21:49.040- 21:54.560* :  to convince someone who's a Republican to vote Democrat and vice versa you're knocking on doors
*21:54.560- 22:00.300* :  of voters who probably would support you if they showed up if they went out to vote but maybe not
*22:00.300- 22:05.640* :  are not going to vote and getting them motivated identifying the ones that you can convince the ones
*22:05.640- 22:11.560* :  that you can get to the polls that is a massive undertaking that takes millions of dollars so those
*22:11.560- 22:15.560* :  are the big things in a candidate travel putting on events having those Donald Trump rallies having
*22:15.560- 22:20.880* :  the Kamala Harris rallies you don't just get a basketball arena for free you have to rent that out
*22:21.220- 22:24.860* :  you have to organize the logistics of it you have to have motorcades you have to have planes
*22:24.860- 22:30.880* :  all of that a national campaign in a country that takes up an entire continent that has
*22:31.460- 22:37.260* :  360 something million people living in it that takes vast amounts of money which is one of the
*22:37.260- 22:43.480* :  reasons why you see both sides spending upwards of a billion dollars on their presidential campaigns
*22:43.480- 22:48.800* :  all told no as you say it's an it's a national campaign but Matt it's the swing states that matter
*22:48.800- 22:54.320* :  right I mean particularly as we get closer and closer to election day if we look at some specifics
*22:54.840- 23:02.400* :  can you see a difference in how the Harris campaign is choosing to spend funds differently to
*23:02.400- 23:08.320* :  to Joe Biden before he dropped out well it's hard to say how they're spending definitely right now
*23:08.320- 23:14.080* :  those numbers are are really in and it's kind of hard to parse that out but what we do see right now
*23:14.080- 23:21.380* :  is that the sunbelt which is in Nevada and Arizona this is much more of a competitive race where
*23:21.380- 23:29.580* :  Donald Trump what was actually pulling ahead it's now much more even and in what we call the
*23:29.580- 23:36.900* :  rust belt or kind of these blue collar areas of Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio Harris has pulled
*23:36.900- 23:42.400* :  slightly ahead and so while it's still a little too early to to determine any final strategy we know
*23:42.400- 23:48.120* :  now there's so much more in play and so they're gonna have decisions I think there's enough money
*23:48.120- 23:53.220* :  to play in all these states but what really happens is they're they have eyes on the ground they have
*23:53.220- 23:59.540* :  pulling they're part of that field work where Georgia was not even in probably in play Harris
*23:59.540- 24:05.380* :  changes that and makes it tempting North Carolina is interesting and in some case they may take into
*24:05.380- 24:10.900* :  account how much money is already in the Senate races because you have very competitive races in
*24:10.900- 24:17.400* :  Michigan Ohio you where there's competitive races is already a ton of money well we even see in
*24:17.400- 24:22.100* :  Montana people are laughing that Donald Trump was visiting there but it is a key state for this
*24:22.100- 24:28.380* :  center run and so where you see these overlapping kind of races and in competition there's going to
*24:28.380- 24:33.560* :  be decisions like I do we need to put more money in here maybe let's just double up this is really
*24:33.560- 24:37.900* :  the secret sauce this is what they're constantly planning this is what they're spending so much money
*24:37.900- 24:43.120* :  and polls and talking about all the time is where we're going to put this money money money money
*24:43.120- 24:49.180* :  Anthony but in the end does it make the difference I mean I found it fascinating to learn that
*24:49.180- 24:56.780* :  Donald Trump actually raised more money after he lost the 2020 election than he had in the leader
*24:56.780- 25:01.880* :  to that election he said you know as we know he said it was stolen and he needed help to fight it
*25:01.880- 25:07.680* :  and I believe he's used lots of those post election funds for to fight his court cases that that
*25:07.680- 25:13.760* :  have turned up will money swing this one well I think money is important but both both campaigns
*25:13.760- 25:18.660* :  seem to have enough money to fund what they're doing and you have to remember at some point there's
*25:18.660- 25:23.740* :  only so much television advertising you can buy I all of the spots are taken up you know with
*25:23.740- 25:28.060* :  the very Senate and congressional campaigns and the presidential campaigns so there's just not
*25:28.060- 25:33.880* :  not places where you can send money if you look back to 2016 Jeb Bush was running for the Republican
*25:33.880- 25:38.980* :  presidential nomination he had more money than he knew what to do with he was sending out DVDs
*25:39.260- 25:45.320* :  a campaign DVDs to various supporters and floorage blanket in the state you know a huge expense
*25:45.320- 25:49.780* :  but that was because he had run out of things to spend money on and he wasn't moving the needle so
*25:50.220- 25:53.540* :  yes it's important to have money it's important to have lots of money to fund these massive
*25:54.040- 25:59.500* :  national presidential campaigns but in the end it comes down to does the voter like your message
*25:59.500- 26:03.920* :  if the voters hearing your message doesn't make a connection and that's what counts and I will also
*26:03.920- 26:09.260* :  say that the way presidential elections are conducted now election day is not just the first Tuesday
*26:09.260- 26:13.900* :  in November people are voting for weeks in advance and so one of these things the campaigns are
*26:13.900- 26:19.520* :  spending money on is identifying who has and hasn't voted yet who is mailed in their ballot who
*26:19.520- 26:24.220* :  is showed up at an early voting station once they do that once they know that the person's voted
*26:24.220- 26:28.180* :  for them they cross them off their list they look for people who they think are their supporters
*26:28.180- 26:33.420* :  who haven't voted yet and getting them out turnout is a huge thing now it's a huge undertaking
*26:33.420- 26:38.080* :  and it's runs from the Pennsylvania they start mailed voting in the middle of September North
*26:38.080- 26:43.200* :  Carolina not much later than that so all of these things it's happening now and it takes money
*26:43.200- 26:49.160* :  an organization but mostly it takes that kind of organization in order to get all of these
*26:49.160- 26:53.100* :  people to the polls and money gets you there but it doesn't always get you over the finish line
*26:53.400- 26:57.840* :  fascinating Matt and Anthony thank you so much for your time thank you so much
