*01:26.340- 01:33.020* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and 1300 eyes GMT on Friday the 27th of September. These are our main stories.
*01:33.020- 01:40.060* :  Hurricane Helene heads to the US state of Georgia after hitting Florida. It was very scary, you know,
*01:40.140- 01:46.500* :  all the water came rushing into the house so grab the dogs and ran as quickly as we could with
*01:46.500- 01:52.640* :  just what we had in our dogs and that was it. Japan has a new prime minister. On a trip to Belgium,
*01:52.640- 01:58.740* :  Pope Francis laments the forced adoption of babies and again apologizes for the treatment of
*01:58.740- 02:06.380* :  some children within the Roman Catholic Church. Child abuse, which is a scourge that the church
*02:06.380- 02:16.460* :  is dressing affirmly and decisively. Also in this podcast, how AI generated clones are being used
*02:16.460- 02:22.360* :  to defraud companies. And you need a few seconds apparently of speech to work with and they pick
*02:22.360- 02:27.020* :  up the mannerisms, they pick up kind of way in the language and the way it's used and actually quite
*02:34.120- 02:38.880* :  believable. Helene which made landfall as a category for hurricane in Florida has now weakened
*02:38.880- 02:45.460* :  to a tropical storm as it moves more inland. The storm is barreling across Georgia towards Tennessee
*02:45.460- 02:52.460* :  and the Carolinas after devastating Florida with fierce winds of up to 225 kilometers per hour
*02:52.840- 02:58.220* :  and flash flooding. Three people have died and nearly two million Florida homes are without
*02:58.220- 03:05.800* :  power. Brianna Garnier lives in the coastal city of Homes Beach. It was very scary you know it's
*03:05.880- 03:14.180* :  it was coming in very very fast but steady across the island and then all of the sudden you know it
*03:14.180- 03:21.540* :  was outside we had stampats and we had prepared but we heard a big bang in the garage door you know
*03:21.540- 03:28.800* :  kind of caved in and all the water came rushing into the house like like a giant stream so grab
*03:28.800- 03:33.840* :  the dogs and ran as quickly as we could with just what we had in our dogs and that was it.
*03:34.300- 03:39.560* :  Officials put in place mandatory evacuation orders for those in the path of the storm and
*03:39.560- 03:45.280* :  warned those who decided to shelter at home to stay put. Alex Harris is a hurricane and climate
*03:45.280- 03:51.200* :  change reporter at Florida's Miami Herald newspaper. The officials always want people to leave
*03:51.200- 03:55.360* :  when our storm comes. It's the safest way to be is just to get out of the way of that storm.
*03:55.920- 04:00.580* :  Most people do evacuate and the sheriffs of those communities have asked anyone who does remain
*04:00.580- 04:05.140* :  to write their name their address and their social security number on their body in marker
*04:05.580- 04:09.940* :  so that they can be identified if necessary after. 17 different counties are under mandatory
*04:09.940- 04:15.420* :  evacuation order that's millions of people driving inland driving to other states trying to get out
*04:15.420- 04:20.720* :  of the way. We've seen thousands of people in shelters up and down the coast. Most of them who
*04:20.940- 04:24.400* :  you know lived in areas that were very low lying very close to the coast or even in
*04:24.740- 04:28.720* :  mobile homes or or manufactured facilities that really just needed to get out of the way.
*04:29.360- 04:35.480* :  55 million people across the southern United States are expected to feel the effects of Helene.
*04:35.920- 04:40.620* :  Syracuse Lucas from BBC Weather tell me more. Well so far we've seen there's extremely
*04:40.620- 04:45.820* :  strong winds we've been talking about 225 kilometers an hour. So it's not just been the power of
*04:45.820- 04:50.880* :  the wind of course that's knocked out power as well but the storm surge has been really significant
*04:50.880- 04:56.000* :  over nine feet so in places around the Florida Big Bend that's a record breaking storm surge
*04:56.300- 05:01.620* :  so that huge body of water just piling inland. I think now the attention is certainly going to be
*05:01.620- 05:06.460* :  turning to the intensity and the duration of the rainfall that we're going to see as well.
*05:06.820- 05:11.400* :  It started off as a category four storm it's been downgraded what does that mean?
*05:11.880- 05:15.380* :  Well it means that the wind speeds have reduced so we're currently seeing winds around about
*05:15.380- 05:20.700* :  110 kilometers an hour so the wind won't be such a problem but even though it's a tropical
*05:20.700- 05:25.220* :  storm not a hurricane it doesn't mean the rain is any less an intensity in fact we're going to see
*05:25.220- 05:29.600* :  really really heavy rain particularly pushing across parts of Kentucky and Tennessee
*05:29.600- 05:33.300* :  around the southern appellations as well because that's where the storm's going to become
*05:33.300- 05:37.380* :  quite slow moving over the next few days so where it bumps into the higher ground of the
*05:37.380- 05:42.960* :  appellations it's going to dump close to 20 inches of rainfall across the region leading to
*05:42.960- 05:47.560* :  flash flooding especially so for urban areas so although it's moving through it's weakening
*05:47.840- 05:53.220* :  it's certainly not going anywhere. So it's going up the south isn't it started off from Florida
*05:53.220- 05:59.560* :  and I mentioned Kentucky I mean how closely can it be tracked? Well forecasters use various things
*05:59.560- 06:03.360* :  to track these storms they use what's going on with the weather at the moment where the winds
*06:03.360- 06:07.700* :  are steering the storm and they also feed all that data into computer models so there's a fairly
*06:07.700- 06:11.600* :  accurate track we think the storm's going to go northwards or northeastwards through
*06:11.600- 06:16.660* :  Georgia as it's moving at the moment into parts of Tennessee Kentucky as well but there's always
*06:16.660- 06:21.000* :  a bit of a cone of uncertainty so it could be a little bit further east a little bit further west
*06:21.420- 06:25.940* :  especially a few days down the line from now that's when the forecast becomes a little bit more
*06:25.940- 06:30.760* :  uncertain but at the moment certainly for the next 24 hours or so with fairly certain that storm
*06:30.760- 06:37.320* :  is going to continue its path. And as far as the big $64,000 question what causes these storms of
*06:37.320- 06:43.720* :  this intensity? Oh yes this is a particularly powerful quite rare major category 4 storm that's
*06:43.720- 06:47.600* :  that's made landfall so of course this is part of the world no stranger to hurricanes we are in
*06:47.600- 06:51.920* :  the middle of peak hurricane season now so the things that cause them initially while the spin
*06:51.920- 06:56.940* :  of the earth so the Coriolis effect creates that spin for hurricanes that we see but hurricanes also
*06:56.940- 07:01.920* :  need a couple of things they need warmth and they need moisture so the very warm waters of the
*07:01.920- 07:08.040* :  Gulf of Mexico are producing the fuel really and as the climate continues to warm sea surface temperatures
*07:08.040- 07:12.460* :  to continue to increase as well that means we're going to see storms like this I think becoming more
*07:12.460- 07:18.880* :  intense in the future. Sarah Keith Lucas. Japan has found out who its next Prime Minister will be
*07:18.880- 07:24.480* :  Shigeru Ishiba a former Defence Minister has won the ruling party's leadership election after
*07:24.480- 07:29.560* :  a second round of voting he's taking over from the current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida who's
*07:29.560- 07:35.260* :  become unpopular because of a series of party scandals and rising prices in a brief speech
*07:35.260- 07:43.860* :  after his victory was announced Mr Ishiba pledged to be honest with the country. I will do my
*07:43.860- 07:48.540* :  utmost to believe in the people to speak the truth with courage and sincerity and to make
*07:48.540- 07:53.200* :  this country a safe and secure place where everyone can live with a smile on their faces once
*07:53.200- 07:54.180* :  again. Thank you very much.
*07:56.640- 08:00.040* :  A correspondent in Tokyo Shama Kiliil tell me more about him.
*08:00.840- 08:06.300* :  Well Shigeru Ishiba has been on the political scene for decades now he is a veteran he is a
*08:06.300- 08:12.440* :  former Defence Minister he is a former LDP Secretary General so he's very experienced on security
*08:12.440- 08:19.380* :  issues but he also knows how the party works how the machinations of the inside party politics
*08:19.380- 08:25.680* :  how they operate what's interesting about him is that he's different from LDP members he says it
*08:25.680- 08:31.420* :  like it is his candor while it ruffles feathers within the party he's recently for example
*08:31.420- 08:36.240* :  been criticizing the Prime Minister will the outgoing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida which is a
*08:36.240- 08:44.660* :  rarity in Japanese politics this candor holds him in good stead with the public and one of the
*08:44.660- 08:51.740* :  reasons some observers were saying that he was chosen was to essentially appeal to the public
*08:51.740- 08:56.520* :  here's a man that says it like it is you know he doesn't do political talk he speaks the truth
*08:57.000- 09:02.200* :  and hopefully that would appeal to a public that has been very angry at the LDP because of recent
*09:02.200- 09:07.260* :  scandals so he he provides a safe pair of hands he provides stability at a turbulent time
*09:07.800- 09:13.860* :  for the party what he doesn't offer I think is a fresh face for the LDP it is desperate to reinvent
*09:13.860- 09:19.720* :  itself it is desperate to regain public trust especially in the fallout of the political funding
*09:19.720- 09:25.600* :  financial scandal and while he will appeal to the public expect a lot of we've learned our lesson
*09:25.600- 09:31.560* :  we've changed we're going to address the economy don't expect a big shake up in the LDP it's
*09:31.560- 09:36.980* :  still a same old party albeit humbled by the recent scandals because there is an election lumens
*09:38.060- 09:45.020* :  that's true the election as it stands is going to be in 2025 so next year but some of the candidates
*09:45.580- 09:49.920* :  including some of of his rivals like Shinjuro Koizumi for example he said that
*09:50.240- 09:54.720* :  it was going to be as soon as this year we don't know if this is something that Mr Ishiba is
*09:54.720- 10:00.020* :  now going to decide there will be a lot of back and forth within party members I think what
*10:00.520- 10:07.280* :  they want to do is not wait too long to be scrutinized by the public and he'll also want to do it
*10:07.580- 10:12.700* :  sooner rather than later to cement his position and what about the challenges facing the country
*10:12.700- 10:18.240* :  you've mentioned the economy what else I think top of his priorities and his challenges is the
*10:18.240- 10:22.760* :  economic wars remember the public has been suffering from a stagnant economy wages that
*10:22.760- 10:27.860* :  haven't moved in three decades they've been struggling to make ends meet so that's one big thing
*10:27.860- 10:34.160* :  but I think also Japan's aging and shrinking population the leader will have to deal with how
*10:34.160- 10:39.560* :  to reinvent the labor market and maybe rethink policies on immigration Shima Khalil
*10:40.340- 10:44.640* :  Lebanese media say Israeli air strikes are still targeting the size of the country
*10:44.640- 10:50.160* :  as frantic diplomatic efforts continue to try to stop an all-out war between Israel and
*10:50.160- 10:55.160* :  Hezbollah pressure is growing on the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to
*10:55.160- 11:00.840* :  a ceasefire in southern Lebanon US officials say Mr Netanyahu gave his backing for a truce
*11:01.040- 11:06.340* :  only to change his mind under pressure from extremists in his government but the Israeli leader
*11:06.340- 11:12.220* :  says negotiations will continue will have more on his position in a moment but first Lebanon
*11:12.220- 11:18.440* :  itself has made an impassioned plea at the UN for a pause in the fighting Abdullah Buhabib
*11:18.440- 11:24.340* :  is the Lebanese foreign minister and his words spoken by translator Mr President Lebanon is
*11:24.340- 11:29.720* :  currently enduring a crisis which is threatening his very existence the future of our people
*11:31.000- 11:37.440* :  and our prosperity are imperiled this is a situation that requires international intervention
*11:37.440- 11:43.920* :  on an urgent basis before the situation spirals out of control with a domino effect
*11:45.540- 11:49.740* :  so with pressure for a ceasefire what are we hearing from Hezbollah I asked our correspondent
*11:49.740- 11:56.260* :  Hugo Bachega who's in Beirut in Lebanon well we haven't heard anything yet from Hezbollah
*11:56.520- 12:01.400* :  obviously you know the conversations the discussions that happen with Hezbollah these are
*12:01.900- 12:07.920* :  indirect conversations because western countries consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization so
*12:07.920- 12:14.320* :  there's no direct contact between western powers involved in these negotiations for a ceasefire
*12:14.700- 12:21.220* :  and Hezbollah but again I think it is very difficult to see how Hezbollah can at this stage
*12:21.220- 12:29.300* :  accept a deal they remain defiant they say that these attacks on Israel are going to continue they
*12:29.300- 12:35.320* :  say that this is in support of Palestinians in Gaza and that these attacks are going to continue
*12:35.320- 12:41.380* :  until there is a ceasefire in Gaza so it's very difficult to see how they're going to detach
*12:41.380- 12:49.300* :  themselves from the situation in Gaza without being seen as abandoning its allies Hamas in Gaza
*12:49.760- 12:56.320* :  and you know one of the main points of its existence which is the resistance against Israel so
*12:56.740- 13:03.100* :  very difficult to see how we can see a de-escalation at the moment and what about those in Lebanon
*13:03.100- 13:09.180* :  who are not supporters of Hezbollah but who are coming under bombardment in these air strikes what
*13:09.180- 13:13.680* :  are they saying yeah what is happening in the countries that people are coming together regardless
*13:13.680- 13:21.600* :  of their political affiliations religion affiliations they believe that the country is under attack
*13:21.680- 13:29.080* :  there's a lot of pressure on services so people are trying to help each other as these attacks continue
*13:29.080- 13:34.640* :  you know widespread attacks thousands of people have been displaced hundreds of people have been
*13:34.640- 13:42.080* :  killed so obviously a lot of people here dislike Hezbollah but they dislike Israel more I think
*13:42.080- 13:49.200* :  you know given the scale of what's happening here we haven't heard strong criticism from people
*13:49.200- 13:55.200* :  who oppose Hezbollah but I think it's fair to say that perhaps some people wouldn't be unhappy
*13:55.200- 14:03.040* :  to see a degraded Hezbollah a weakened Hezbollah because this is a group that many say acts as a
*14:03.040- 14:10.400* :  state within the state many people have been accusing Hezbollah of dragging Lebanon into a conflict
*14:10.400- 14:16.880* :  with Israel that is not in the country's interest but up until now we're seeing unity and we're
*14:16.880- 14:23.240* :  seeing people coming together to help those who've been affected by the conflict Yuga Bachega in Beirut
*14:24.040- 14:30.220* :  Pope Francis has again apologized and expressed shame over child sexual abuse in the Catholic church
*14:30.220- 14:34.000* :  He's in Belgium where he'll meet some of the survivors of that abuse
*14:34.320- 14:37.800* :  He's also expressed sorrow over the practice of forced adoption
*14:38.480- 14:41.300* :  I've been speaking to our Europe Regional Editor Danny Eberhardt
*14:42.020- 14:46.200* :  Well this is a major problem for the Catholic church globally obviously you think of countries like
*14:46.200- 14:52.160* :  Ireland, Spain, Poland these sort of places but also in Belgium so there's been a couple of
*14:52.560- 14:57.520* :  parliamentary inquiries already in Belgium into the issue and there may well be a third one
*14:58.400- 15:07.120* :  so the Pope in a very heartfelt way about the shame of the issue and acknowledging that the church
*15:07.120- 15:13.180* :  had to take responsibility for it but he did say that the church was taking action to address the issue
*15:13.980- 15:20.040* :  I refer to the tragic instances of child abuse which is a scourge that the church is addressing
*15:20.040- 15:26.240* :  firmly and decisively by listening to and accompanying those who have been wounded and by
*15:26.240- 15:31.720* :  implementing a prevention program throughout the world. Brothers and sisters this is a shame
*15:31.720- 15:39.580* :  the abuse of minors. He also talked about forced adoption didn't he? Yeah and this is a problem that
*15:40.100- 15:46.200* :  exists obviously in wider society it's not just the Catholic church but obviously Catholic church
*15:46.220- 15:53.980* :  institutions were heavily involved in this one news site estimated about 30,000 children in
*15:53.980- 16:00.240* :  Belgium were taken from their mothers between 1945 and the 1980s so from institutions for example
*16:00.240- 16:07.060* :  around by nuns and the Pope this is what the Pope Pope Francis had to say about this issue.
*16:10.060- 16:15.400* :  I was saddened to learn about the practice of forced adoption that also took place here in Belgium
*16:15.400- 16:22.860* :  between the 1950s and the 1970s. In those poignant stories we see how the bitter fruit of
*16:22.860- 16:29.120* :  wrongdoing and criminality was mixed in with what was unfortunately the prevailing view in all
*16:29.120- 16:36.480* :  parts of society at that time. So he said it was the problem that was justified as being in the
*16:36.480- 16:41.240* :  interest of both the mother and the child and many in society saw that it was protecting them
*16:41.240- 16:49.760* :  from stigma of giving birth or being an illegitimate child but obviously there's much greater
*16:49.760- 16:55.980* :  knowledge now of the massive trauma and injustice done both to mothers and children on that so
*16:55.980- 17:02.400* :  the idea that people may have been acting in good conscience at the time the society's view of
*17:02.400- 17:08.600* :  that has radically transformed. And the Pope is meeting survivors isn't he but is being pushed
*17:08.600- 17:14.520* :  to do more? Yeah so what was interesting Val was that the King Philippe the King of the Belgians
*17:14.800- 17:20.760* :  was also at this audience and spoke in unusually direct terms about this as did Prime Minister
*17:20.760- 17:27.700* :  Alexander de Crore. So the King spoke of the fact that the church the Catholic Church had taken far
*17:27.700- 17:33.940* :  too long to address these scandals. Alexander de Crore the Prime Minister said that words were not
*17:33.940- 17:40.780* :  enough and concrete measures must be taken. He's also underlined the fact that both of these scandals
*17:40.780- 17:46.620* :  child abuse and forced adoption had badly damaged the trust between the church and Belgian society
*17:47.760- 17:54.560* :  and there's the meeting this afternoon between the victims and the Pope will last about an hour
*17:55.000- 18:01.640* :  and a lot of victims have been calling for justice obviously but also for reparations as part of
*18:01.640- 18:07.800* :  that. And of course what's happened in Belgium happened as you said across the world. The Catholic
*18:07.800- 18:13.060* :  Church has already paid out massive sums in places like the US for this sort of abuse. The
*18:13.060- 18:18.840* :  Pope has made it one of the prime objectives of his papacy to tackle it but critics say he was
*18:18.840- 18:26.340* :  very slow in in getting that ball rolling. Danny Eberhardt the actress de Maggie Smith has
*18:26.340- 18:33.840* :  died at the age of 89. Katie Russell looks back to her life. Little girls and in the business of
*18:33.840- 18:39.160* :  putting all hands on young shoulders. Maggie Smith in the prime of Miss Jean Brody. I am
*18:39.160- 18:45.800* :  dedicated to you in my prime. She won an Oscar for her portrayal of a maverick teacher in 1930s
*18:45.800- 18:51.060* :  Edinburgh. Though with typical rye humor she claimed it did her little good. We said absolutely
*18:51.060- 18:58.700* :  no effect on my career whatsoever. I have to say because when I did get it for best actress I didn't
*18:58.700- 19:04.300* :  think I worked again in films for years. In fact she appeared in five films over the next 10 years
*19:04.700- 19:09.980* :  and won another Oscar for California Suite playing an actress who has been nominated for an academy
*19:09.980- 19:17.700* :  award. I have a definite hump on my left shoulder. It calls 500 pounds and I look like rich of the third.
*19:18.920- 19:25.440* :  Do you notice? Sydney. Maggie Smith had already become a star as a classical actress on the stage
*19:25.440- 19:32.980* :  and on TV in roles such as Porsche in the merchant of Venice. If he lose he makes a swan like and
*19:32.980- 19:38.820* :  fading in music. She was versatile, even singing and dancing in a what a lovely war.
*19:39.080- 19:45.260* :  But on Saturday I'm willing if you'll only take the shilling to make a man of anyone.
*19:45.520- 19:51.760* :  But she had a particular genius for comedy. I prefer acting in straight plays but I find that
*19:51.760- 19:58.540* :  comedy is much easier for me personally. For Maggie Smith, serious acting and comedy weren't so far
*19:58.540- 20:04.220* :  apart. Here she is in Alan Bennett's talking heads playing the quietly desperate wife of a vicar.
*20:04.860- 20:12.180* :  The sermon was about sex. I didn't actually nod off there. I'd heard it before.
*20:12.880- 20:18.500* :  She played some of her best loved characters in her 70s including Professor McGonnell in the Harry
*20:18.500- 20:24.440* :  Potter films. Now today we will be transforming animals into what?
*20:24.780- 20:30.800* :  And in Downton Abbey she was the Dowager counters of Grantham, mistress of the devastating put down.
*20:31.420- 20:36.140* :  When I'm with her I'm reminded of the virtues of the English. But isn't she American?
*20:37.220- 20:42.780* :  Exactly. Dame Maggie Smith who has died at the age of 89.
*20:46.260- 20:51.240* :  We learn what we can expect from a meeting between Velodimir Zelensky and Donald Trump.
*20:59.660- 21:05.200* :  Good taste is easy to spot but hard to pin down. You know it when you see it. And in today's
*21:05.200- 21:10.400* :  culture there's no greater signifier of taste than the car you drive. You want something
*21:11.420- 21:17.780* :  sophisticated but not stodgy. Daring yet classic, approachable but with an air of opulence.
*21:17.900- 21:23.180* :  That's where the Range Rover evoke comes in. The reductive exterior is an elegant expression
*21:23.300- 21:29.740* :  of Range Rover DNA and the chiseled taillight graphics give the evoke a sense of motion even at
*21:29.740- 21:35.660* :  standstill. Explore the Range Rover evoke at LandRoverUSA.com.
*21:36.040- 21:41.160* :  It used to be seen as a costly and risky challenge but sustainability has now become a business
*21:41.160- 21:49.400* :  imperative. Not having the data is no longer an excuse. I'm Chip Kleinexel host of Resilient Edge,
*21:49.720- 21:54.720* :  a business vitality podcast paid and presented by Deloitte and produced by BBC Storyworks Commercial
*21:54.720- 22:00.560* :  Productions. Our second episode is all about moving from intention to action on sustainability.
*22:01.080- 22:05.540* :  Episode 2 of Resilient Edge is coming soon everywhere you listen to podcasts.
*22:11.920- 22:18.060* :  The BBC has been on a rare trip to Omdeban, part of Sudan's capital and one of the battlefields
*22:18.060- 22:23.680* :  of the country's civil war. The army pushed the paramilitary rapid support forces out of key
*22:23.680- 22:28.480* :  areas in months of fierce fighting earlier this year and now it's launched a new offensive
*22:28.480- 22:34.100* :  to take back Khartoum. Civilians are suffering from regular shelling and those living in RSF
*22:34.100- 22:39.200* :  held areas, particularly women, have described lies of almost unbearable hardship.
*22:39.940- 22:42.980* :  Barbara Plattasha sent us this report from the city.
*22:47.700- 22:52.380* :  I'm on the outskirts of Omdeban at a transit point for people who are coming out of RSF held
*22:52.380- 22:58.320* :  territory into an area that is controlled by the army. Some of them are walking, some of them
*22:58.320- 23:04.420* :  are coming on donkey carts, some of them are fleeing permanently to a safer area. Others are
*23:04.420- 23:09.760* :  crossing the line so that they can go to a market and buy goods more cheaply and then go back to
*23:09.760- 23:15.740* :  their homes and we have been hearing horrific stories about what life is like under the RSF.
*23:19.740- 23:22.200* :  So what was it like coming here? What was your journey like?
*23:22.200- 23:28.980* :  It was very difficult these women tell me. At every RSF checkpoint we had to pay they say,
*23:28.980- 23:34.340* :  they walked for four hours to buy food, their husbands can't leave the house for fear of being
*23:34.340- 23:39.340* :  beaten or detained. What about the women? Are the women safe or unsafe?
*23:42.020- 23:46.020* :  The chorus of voices died down until one woman burst out.
*23:47.020- 23:51.460* :  There are so many women here who've been raped but they don't talk about it.
*23:52.200- 23:58.080* :  What difference would it make anyway? Some girls, the RSF makes them lie in the streets at night.
*23:58.880- 24:03.540* :  If they come back late from this market, the RSF keeps them for five or six days.
*24:09.960- 24:15.760* :  As she spoke, her mother sat with head in hand, sobbing. Other women around her also started crying.
*24:22.740- 24:28.140* :  You in your world, if your child went out, would you leave her? Wouldn't you go look for her?
*24:28.220- 24:34.840* :  What can we do? Nothing is in our hands. No one cares for us. We are cut off.
*24:36.760- 24:42.280* :  I asked them why they didn't leave. We're too poor they told me. We have nowhere else to go.
*24:48.020- 24:53.880* :  The capital is still an active war zone but its sexual violence that's become a defining
*24:53.880- 25:00.840* :  characteristic of the conflict. Both sides are accused of war crimes but the RSF more so than the
*25:00.840- 25:11.700* :  army, especially when it comes to rape. They deny the charges. One woman tells us her own story.
*25:14.640- 25:19.580* :  She now works at a tea stall in the market at the transit point but at the beginning of the war
*25:19.580- 25:25.160* :  she says, armed men broke into her house demanding to rape her two daughters. The youngest was
*25:25.200- 25:34.440* :  ten years old. We've chosen to protect her identity for her safety. I told the girls to stay
*25:34.440- 25:40.480* :  behind me and I said to the RSF, if you want to rape anyone, it has to be me. They hit me and told
*25:40.480- 25:45.480* :  me to take off my clothes. Before I took them off, I told my girls to leave and they jumped over
*25:45.480- 25:56.880* :  the fence. Then one of the men laid on me. The other women we met are gathering now to begin the
*25:56.880- 26:04.900* :  trek back home. For as long as this war goes on, they have no choice but to return to its horrors.
*26:05.960- 26:12.100* :  Barbara Pletasha. Ukraine's president Vladimir Zelensky is due to meet Donald Trump on Friday at
*26:12.100- 26:17.500* :  Trump Tower in New York. In talks at the White House, President Biden promised him unwavering
*26:17.500- 26:22.680* :  support for Ukraine and stressed the importance of strengthening its position on the battlefield.
*26:22.680- 26:28.280* :  But Mr. Trump has become increasingly critical of continued US funding for the conflict
*26:28.280- 26:34.240* :  and in recent days has sharpened his attacks against Mr. Zelensky. His art North America correspondent
*26:34.240- 26:40.380* :  David Willis. President Zelensky's meeting with Donald Trump could prove the most significant
*26:40.380- 26:47.380* :  of his current US tour. Shortly after President Biden and his deputy Kamala Harris had separately
*26:47.420- 26:53.860* :  restated their continued unwavering support for Ukraine, and Mr. Biden had announced a new
*26:53.860- 27:00.160* :  military aid package valued at nearly $8 billion, came word that a meeting with Miss Harris'
*27:00.160- 27:06.480* :  presidential rival would be taking place after all. Such a meeting appeared to have been put on
*27:06.480- 27:13.580* :  ice amid growing anger on the part of senior Republicans over a visit by Mr. Zelensky earlier in
*27:13.580- 27:20.440* :  the week to the swing state of Pennsylvania, which they deemed partisan, and by Donald Trump's
*27:20.440- 27:27.140* :  increasingly personal criticism of the Ukrainian leader himself. As well as condemning Ukraine's
*27:27.140- 27:33.780* :  failure to strike a deal with Russia to end the war, Mr. Trump also characterized the Ukrainian leader
*27:33.780- 27:40.460* :  as probably the greatest salesman on earth. Given the contrasting political views surrounding
*27:40.480- 27:47.020* :  continued funding of the war in Ukraine from its biggest international donor, much clearly depends
*27:47.020- 27:50.980* :  on the outcome of this year's US presidential election.
*27:51.820- 27:57.220* :  David Willis. Kenya's president William Ruta has announced that 600 more Kenyan security
*27:57.220- 28:02.780* :  personnel will be deployed to Haiti by the end of the year to fight armed gangs and police
*28:02.780- 28:07.940* :  the country. At home, his own police have been accused of firing on protesters while out of
*28:07.940- 28:12.740* :  uniform. President Ruta, who's current in New York for the UN General Assembly, has been speaking
*28:12.740- 28:20.600* :  to Sumi Somaskanda. What has been achieved in 100 days is phenomenal. The palace is now safe,
*28:20.600- 28:27.420* :  the airport is now safe, the hospital is now okay, the police academy has been recovered and
*28:27.420- 28:35.200* :  their policemen are now being trained. The port is fairly quiet, so the challenge we have is that
*28:35.200- 28:42.200* :  we only have 400 security officers supporting the Haitian police. If we had the deployment of
*28:42.200- 28:48.340* :  2500, we would be talking about a different story and that is why I took the decision when I went
*28:48.340- 28:53.460* :  to Haiti and realized that the amount of progress that had been made on the ground and understood
*28:53.460- 29:01.100* :  that their impediment is the numbers because territory that has been recovered cannot be contained
*29:01.100- 29:06.260* :  because there are fewer officers than are required. Therefore I made the decision that next month
*29:06.260- 29:14.540* :  we will send 300 security personnel in November, we will send another 300 and I am going to work
*29:14.540- 29:22.080* :  with all the other partner countries, the US, Canada, Caribbean, the Burundi, Chad and all the other
*29:22.080- 29:28.780* :  countries that have, including Benin, that have committed to deploying troops so that we can do this
*29:29.160- 29:35.220* :  by January because I believe that within a year we should be able to complete that task and be
*29:35.220- 29:39.040* :  able to stabilize the situation. Absolutely. So let me ask you this because you're describing
*29:39.040- 29:43.340* :  progress. The BBC has spoken to people on the ground who say many Haitians are very disillusioned
*29:43.520- 29:48.680* :  with this deployment so far because they say gang violence and gangs have tightened their grip.
*29:49.200- 29:55.640* :  Did you witness that? Well, I think the people of Haiti are really entitled to feel that we aren't
*29:55.640- 30:01.540* :  doing enough and because of the disparate situation the people of Haiti have been subjected to
*30:01.540- 30:08.160* :  for years. I am very confident this time round that looking at the situation, assessing, listening
*30:08.160- 30:12.980* :  to the commanders, I think we have a real chance to stabilize Haiti. You will know that there has
*30:12.980- 30:18.520* :  been criticism at home in Kenya as well over this deployment and we saw Amnesty International
*30:18.700- 30:23.340* :  and Kenya release a report recently about what happened during anti-government protests in your
*30:23.340- 30:29.180* :  country and they said on June 25th, Kenyan police out of uniform with no official identification
*30:29.220- 30:38.440* :  fired live rounds at demonstrators. Is that true? Well, that is the assertion of Amnesty International.
*30:39.280- 30:44.560* :  The situation in Kenya is different and there are assessments. We have an independent
*30:45.520- 30:51.280* :  police oversight authority that investigates every allegation against the police.
*30:51.440- 30:54.860* :  So you saying this report is not true? That exercise is going on. In fact,
*30:55.880- 31:01.760* :  the situation that you are discussing is under investigation in Kenya. I do not think anybody can
*31:01.760- 31:08.200* :  arrive at a conclusion that these or that happened unless and until an independent investigation
*31:08.240- 31:13.180* :  is carried out. And if you ask for criticism, you know there are many pessimists, there are many
*31:13.180- 31:18.900* :  critics, there are many people who never thought that this deployment would happen and that we
*31:18.900- 31:24.280* :  would make any significant progress. I want to tell you that sentiment even in Kenya is changing
*31:24.600- 31:28.640* :  because people are realizing there is progress being made on the ground. Just quickly, if you are
*31:28.640- 31:34.200* :  independent investigation comes to the conclusion that there was a misconduct by the police,
*31:34.240- 31:39.360* :  there will be consequences? Absolutely. I mean, that is why we have an independent institution
*31:39.360- 31:47.380* :  and Kenya is a functional democracy. We are robustly democratic and we have institutions,
*31:47.540- 31:52.380* :  we have an independent judiciary, we have a parliament that works, we have an executive that is
*31:52.660- 31:58.660* :  held accountable by all the agencies, including independent institutions like the independent
*31:58.660- 32:04.900* :  police oversight authority. Kenya's president William Rutter, companies have been warned about the
*32:04.900- 32:10.600* :  increasing use of AI to carry out what has been called CEO fraud. More victims are coming forward
*32:10.600- 32:16.900* :  with their stories of being targeted using generative AI techniques. One case in Hong Kong reportedly
*32:16.900- 32:24.180* :  saw an AI clone used during a video meeting to trick staff into losing $25 million. But while some
*32:24.180- 32:30.620* :  fear the rise of AI clones, companies including Zoom say we should be excited about a future where
*32:30.620- 32:36.980* :  your own clone can go to a meeting on your behalf. Cyber Correspondent Joe Tidey and his clone reports.
*32:37.840- 32:44.700* :  Hello Joe, what is it that Joe Tidey likes to do for fun? I enjoy participating in triathlon's
*32:44.700- 32:49.160* :  marathons and wild swimming. I also like golfing and Emma Movie geek. Did you spot the difference
*32:49.160- 32:55.840* :  there? The first voice was me. The second was an AI clone of me, not just my voice, my face too,
*32:56.020- 33:02.140* :  albeit a bit twitchy and with a lot of blinking. What are your thoughts on artificial intelligence?
*33:03.320- 33:08.620* :  I believe artificial intelligence AI has immense transformative potential. It can revolution. Aside
*33:08.620- 33:14.940* :  from the long delays, it works pretty well, one-on-one. But what happens if I send my clone to a work meeting?
*33:17.320- 33:23.180* :  Hi team, thank you very much. Sorry, I had to make downstairs to get to do something. So, Joe,
*33:23.180- 33:32.660* :  can you update us on what you're working on? Oh, thank you. Oh, it is AI, isn't it?
*33:33.040- 33:37.100* :  It's AI, it's definitely AI. I said it was AI to start with. The blinking was so weird.
*33:37.380- 33:43.100* :  What's he saying? It's pretty fascinating stuff. By the way, my connection has been a bit dodgy
*33:43.100- 33:48.980* :  today, so if I'm slow to respond, you know why. This AI clone was fooling no one then,
*33:49.280- 33:54.140* :  but there's growing excitement about the tech. Zoom's CEO says we'll one day be able to send
*33:54.140- 33:59.580* :  our clones to meetings on our behalf. But of course, criminals are experimenting too.
*34:00.100- 34:06.100* :  Police in Hong Kong are investigating, after cyber fraudsters used some sort of AI face and voice
*34:06.100- 34:13.100* :  cloning to trick an employee during a live work video meeting. 25 million dollars was transferred
*34:13.100- 34:18.260* :  in the fake deal in February, thought to be the first case of criminals using live cloning tools
*34:18.260- 34:23.700* :  to carry out so-called CEO fraud. But voice cloning attacks are now far more common.
*34:26.180- 34:31.620* :  Martin, upon seeing the NDI, I will be able to form an issue with additional details to ensure
*34:31.620- 34:35.880* :  the successful completion of this operation. In his central London office, Martin Greenfield,
*34:35.880- 34:41.700* :  the CEO of Security Company, Cube Orbis, shows me the voice notes that he thought were from his
*34:41.700- 34:46.000* :  new boss. Yeah, I mean, they were quite lifelike. And actually, later on in the process,
*34:46.000- 34:50.400* :  we'll actually forward these to someone who's known him for years. He actually said, okay,
*34:50.400- 34:56.360* :  well, that actually could be marker. Martin was very nearly tricked into transferring 800,000
*34:56.360- 35:05.520* :  pounds to the criminals. So presumably, the criminals would have taken maybe even that video,
*35:06.160- 35:10.180* :  put it through a machine, then made your voice notes. Absolutely. And you need a few seconds
*35:10.180- 35:15.320* :  apparently of speech to work with, and they pick up the mannerisms, they pick up the kind of way
*35:15.320- 35:21.060* :  in the language and the way it's used, and actually quite believable. Martin only spotted the scam
*35:21.060- 35:25.900* :  after triple checking an email address used by the scammers, pretending to be a lawyer.
*35:26.920- 35:30.300* :  All the perils and positives of AI clones are coming at us fast.
*35:30.400- 35:33.040* :  Great to see you back. What would you like to talk about today?
*35:33.420- 35:39.060* :  My clone's creator, Sooner-Linera, from Friar AI, says there is real potential in this technology.
*35:39.820- 35:45.000* :  There are differences in expectations. If I'm telling you, I have created a digital twin,
*35:45.000- 35:53.120* :  it acts exactly like me. You would pretty soon tell me that, no, this is not you.
*35:54.080- 35:59.620* :  On the other hand, if I say, hey, I have an assistant, it's an AI, you'd have a completely
*35:59.620- 36:05.320* :  different set of expectations. Face swapping technology does cost a lot of money to do right.
*36:05.780- 36:09.820* :  But again, everything gets cheaper and it happens so fast.
*36:10.780- 36:15.040* :  Clearly, we're going to have to start working a lot harder to make sure we know who's on the other
*36:15.040- 36:20.560* :  side of that screen. If you ever have more questions or want to chat again, feel free to reach out.
*36:20.900- 36:21.780* :  Have a wonderful day.
*36:22.580- 36:28.480* :  Joe Tidey and his clone, no clones of presenters on the podcast yet.
*36:31.820- 36:35.300* :  That's it for us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
