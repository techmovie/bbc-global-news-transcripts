*01:19.880- 01:23.240* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.880- 01:30.660* :  I'm Janet Jalil and in the early hours of Monday, the 30th of September, these are our
*01:30.660- 01:31.280* :  main stories.
*01:32.080- 01:36.780* :  Lebanon's health ministry says more than 50 people have been killed in Israel's continuing
*01:36.780- 01:38.680* :  airstrikes across the country.
*01:39.360- 01:44.200* :  These ready forces have widened their offensive by attacking who fee power plants and port
*01:44.200- 01:45.480* :  facilities in Yemen.
*01:46.680- 01:51.880* :  The far right freedom party in Austria is on course to come first in Sunday's general
*01:52.380- 01:52.400* :  election.
*01:55.420- 02:04.980* :  Also in this podcast, we love the music so much and to hear the music, it makes really
*02:08.800- 02:08.820* :  goosebumps.
*02:08.820- 02:12.660* :  We hear about the prized Georgian tradition of polyphonic singing.
*02:17.600- 02:22.860* :  We begin in Lebanon where the health ministry says more than 50 people were killed in Israeli
*02:22.860- 02:24.900* :  strikes across Lebanon on Sunday.
*02:25.440- 02:31.540* :  It said at least 32 died in attacks in the southern Aine Al-Delbe area and 21 more in
*02:31.540- 02:33.420* :  the eastern Balbek Hamel region.
*02:34.180- 02:38.060* :  Israel says it struck more than 120 Hezbollah targets.
*02:38.700- 02:43.140* :  There's been no let up in the Israeli bombardment since its assassination of Hezbollah's leader
*02:43.140- 02:44.620* :  Hassan Nazrallah on Friday.
*02:45.520- 02:50.860* :  At the same time, Israel has expanded its attack on Iranian-backed militants by hitting
*02:50.860- 02:52.720* :  who fee targets in Yemen.
*02:53.400- 02:59.320* :  Washington has warned Israel against starting an all-out war with Hezbollah, but it also says
*02:59.320- 03:03.780* :  it's prepared for a reaction from the militant group or its main-backer Iran.
*03:04.300- 03:07.560* :  From Beirut, he is our Middle East correspondent Yuga Bishaka.
*03:12.280- 03:17.980* :  Israel says its offensive against Hezbollah will not stop, and this is proof of it.
*03:18.460- 03:23.260* :  A massive strike on the eastern Bikar Valley, one of 30 in just one hour.
*03:23.700- 03:27.400* :  There were also fresh attacks on southern Beirut, the group's stronghold.
*03:28.020- 03:31.780* :  One of them, this afternoon, happened shortly after we drove through Dahia.
*03:32.360- 03:35.780* :  Once Hezbollah's beating heart, it now looks like a ghost town.
*03:36.500- 03:42.000* :  Streets are empty, shops closed, and people are still trying to flee, with some apparently
*03:42.000- 03:42.840* :  living on foot.
*03:46.740- 03:51.780* :  Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mekati said as many as a million people might have fled
*03:51.780- 03:53.140* :  their homes across the country.
*03:53.720- 03:56.780* :  He called it the largest displacement in recent memory.
*03:57.700- 04:02.340* :  Authorities are struggling to assist everyone in need, with shelters and hospitals under
*04:02.340- 04:02.780* :  pressure.
*04:03.700- 04:08.280* :  Lebanon is now in a tense and anxious weight, to see how Hezbollah is going to respond
*04:08.280- 04:11.360* :  to the attacks that have claimed so many of its leadership.
*04:12.280- 04:16.960* :  And as an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon looks imminent, concerns persist about this
*04:16.960- 04:19.060* :  becoming a wider regional conflict.
*04:19.860- 04:25.160* :  Speaking to the US network ABC, the White House National Security spokesman John Kirby
*04:25.160- 04:28.180* :  said it seemed likely that Iran would react.
*04:28.700- 04:31.480* :  Well, the rhetoric certainly suggests they're going to try to do something.
*04:31.480- 04:35.280* :  I mean, they're just coming out of Tehran, but we don't really know.
*04:35.280- 04:42.380* :  We're watching this very, very closely to see how, if and how, Hezbollah and Iran may
*04:42.380- 04:42.740* :  react.
*04:42.880- 04:47.900* :  Probably preparing for such a scenario, Israel went on the attack on another front today,
*04:48.440- 04:50.960* :  with airstrikes on the city of Hodeidah in Yemen.
*04:51.400- 04:55.940* :  The military said it had targeted power plants and a seaport, being used by the Houthis
*04:56.180- 04:57.500* :  who were supported by Iran.
*04:58.060- 05:02.800* :  Efforts to de-escalate this conflict has so far failed, and the opposite is happening.
*05:03.560- 05:04.620* :  You go, Bishegar.
*05:05.160- 05:09.920* :  Well, Hezbollah says it's recovered the body of its assassinated leader, Hassan Nazrallah,
*05:09.920- 05:12.440* :  from the wreckage of a building in southern Beirut.
*05:12.960- 05:18.800* :  More details have emerged of how Israeli forces managed to locate and kill Nazrallah, and
*05:18.800- 05:21.500* :  several more Hezbollah leaders in Friday's attack.
*05:21.500- 05:24.140* :  Our security correspondent Frank Gardner reports.
*05:24.620- 05:28.320* :  Israel's decision to target the Hezbollah leader was a strategic one.
*05:28.700- 05:32.680* :  It was taken in the clear knowledge it would be raising the stakes dramatically in its
*05:32.680- 05:37.760* :  ongoing conflict with Iran's allies, around the Middle East, what Tehran calls the Axis
*05:37.760- 05:38.380* :  of Resistance.
*05:39.260- 05:43.660* :  Hassan Nazrallah had a metaphorical target on his back from the moment he took over the
*05:43.660- 05:49.700* :  leadership from his predecessor, Abbas Musawe, himself assassinated by Israel in 1992.
*05:50.720- 05:55.640* :  His whereabouts were supposed to be a closely guarded secret, known only to a tiny handful
*05:55.640- 06:01.980* :  of his most trusted followers, and in recent years he had rarely been seen, except in pre-recorded
*06:01.980- 06:03.160* :  TV broadcasts.
*06:03.740- 06:09.040* :  But the events at the past fortnight have demonstrated just how deeply penetrated Hezbollah's
*06:09.040- 06:11.260* :  security is by Israeli intelligence.
*06:12.040- 06:17.220* :  Sabotaging the group's pages with explosives would have taken months of planning amid total
*06:17.220- 06:17.840* :  secrecy.
*06:18.560- 06:23.900* :  Israel clearly has human informants on the ground in Lebanon, revealing not just the location
*06:23.900- 06:27.540* :  of concealed weapons dumps, but the whereabouts of senior commanders.
*06:28.480- 06:31.820* :  That intelligence led to the airstrike that killed Hassan Nazrallah.
*06:32.400- 06:38.060* :  Israeli Air Force F-15 warplanes reportedly dropped 80 bunker-busting bombs, hitting
*06:38.060- 06:42.100* :  the underground cellar in South Barut, where he was meeting other Hezbollah leaders.
*06:42.920- 06:47.460* :  Hassan Nazrallah will be replaced, but it could take years for that new leader to build
*06:47.460- 06:52.420* :  up a following, and in the current climate, time is probably not on his side.
*06:53.700- 06:54.340* :  Frank Gardner.
*06:54.960- 06:59.060* :  Well, the timing of Hassan Nazrallah's funeral has not yet been announced, but it's thought
*06:59.060- 07:01.240* :  it may be held as early as Monday.
*07:01.840- 07:06.960* :  Hezbollah has confirmed that another of its senior commanders, Nabeel Koch, was killed
*07:06.960- 07:09.100* :  in a separate airstrike on Saturday.
*07:10.200- 07:15.340* :  There are reports from Iran that the aging Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Hamine, amid concerns
*07:15.340- 07:19.780* :  that he could also be a target for assassination, has been taken to a safe location.
*07:20.580- 07:25.520* :  While Iran is vowing to avenge the Hezbollah leader's death in Lebanon, it seems it wants
*07:25.520- 07:29.240* :  its proxies to take the lead, rather than doing so itself.
*07:29.920- 07:34.700* :  Aham Gabbari from BBC Persian told us more about what Iran's leaders had been saying
*07:34.700- 07:35.380* :  on Sunday.
*07:35.780- 07:39.600* :  Today, Iranian Foreign Minister and also Speaker of the Parliament reacted to the killing
*07:39.600- 07:44.280* :  of Hassan Nazrallah, and they both said that the resistance movement is going to give
*07:44.280- 07:45.660* :  the proper response to Israel.
*07:45.800- 07:48.020* :  Now, they resisted what they mean by the resistance movement.
*07:48.080- 07:52.560* :  They were referring to Iranian proxies from Hussis in Yemen to militia groups like
*07:52.560- 07:56.060* :  Katabel Hezbollah in Iraq and also Hezbollah in Lebanon.
*07:56.580- 08:02.260* :  Now, their comments echoes Iranian Supreme Leader Hamine's statement that was published
*08:02.260- 08:06.240* :  yesterday, which two key elements were missing in there.
*08:06.420- 08:11.380* :  One, he said that he did not mention Iran is going to retaliate.
*08:11.380- 08:16.560* :  He said that the resistance movement, the other thing was that he said that usually typically
*08:16.560- 08:20.780* :  in such situations, you know, in previous assassinations and attacks, they used words
*08:20.780- 08:25.600* :  like harsh revenge or a heavy slap on the face of Israel and America.
*08:25.900- 08:26.880* :  This time, that was missing.
*08:27.020- 08:30.680* :  They used a much softer tone and a much more restrained language.
*08:30.680- 08:33.400* :  They said that his blood would not go unevent.
*08:33.780- 08:34.920* :  So this is the two difference.
*08:35.300- 08:40.220* :  Probably Iranians are calculating the risks of getting into a full-blown war.
*08:40.220- 08:44.400* :  And that's why, again, many Iranian officials, including Iranian foreign minister, keep
*08:44.400- 08:49.660* :  saying that this is a trap by Israel they want us to get involved in a full-blown war.
*08:49.840- 08:52.960* :  The hardliners in Iran are not happy with this response.
*08:53.040- 08:54.120* :  They are furious.
*08:54.740- 09:00.080* :  Last night, when I was watching the Iranian State TV, Iranian hardliners were extremely
*09:00.080- 09:06.040* :  angry, saying that if we do not stop and give a heavy response to Israel, this cycle of
*09:06.040- 09:10.220* :  violence is going to continue, and next time they are going to target Iran.
*09:10.800- 09:12.680* :  And this has happened already.
*09:12.680- 09:13.340* :  A smile, Hania.
*09:13.340- 09:20.400* :  Hamas leader was assassinated in Tehran, and Iran did not refrain from giving any retaliatory
*09:20.640- 09:21.720* :  strike in that example.
*09:22.200- 09:25.860* :  So this is what Iranians call it, strategic patience.
*09:25.860- 09:30.280* :  So whether in the coming days, they are going to continue using that as strategic patience
*09:30.280- 09:32.600* :  or give a proper response as yet to be decided.
*09:32.800- 09:35.640* :  Meanwhile, the Supreme Leader has gone into hiding.
*09:35.640- 09:41.160* :  I mean, this may look weak, but at the same time, top officials in Iran are really worried
*09:41.160- 09:45.980* :  about Israeli intelligence because if it's been able to penetrate Hasbola, so effective
*09:45.980- 09:48.480* :  late, it's almost certain it's likely to have done the same with Iran.
*09:48.740- 09:53.200* :  That's a very important question because this is not what only Israelis are saying, but
*09:53.200- 09:58.300* :  Iranian top officials have been saying it for years that Israel has managed to infiltrate
*09:58.300- 10:01.300* :  Iranian intelligence system to the highest level.
*10:01.820- 10:07.200* :  And one Iranian former intelligence minister said that openly that Iranian officials,
*10:07.200- 10:09.860* :  top Iranian officials should be scared for their lives.
*10:10.060- 10:12.800* :  And that's a really serious, you know, comments.
*10:13.220- 10:17.780* :  So and we see that smile, Hania, when he was in Tehran, the exact location was targeted
*10:17.780- 10:22.080* :  in a building where exactly the flat that he was staying at, that place was located.
*10:22.080- 10:24.200* :  The same pattern has happened in Lebanon as well.
*10:24.660- 10:27.640* :  The Hasbola commanders, they were targeted in their cars.
*10:27.640- 10:29.820* :  They were targeted in the buildings.
*10:29.820- 10:33.500* :  They were staying not the entire building, but the exact location was targeted.
*10:33.840- 10:36.140* :  And also the pages on Waki Taki's that they were exploded.
*10:36.180- 10:41.700* :  It shows that Israel has proven that they have won the intelligence war, apart from the
*10:41.700- 10:47.520* :  military technologies and, you know, equipment that you have, Israelis have proven that
*10:47.520- 10:54.360* :  they have enough intelligence to target Iranians and its allies anywhere, probably at any
*10:54.360- 10:54.640* :  time.
*10:55.640- 10:57.520* :  Baham Gobaadi from BBC Persian.
*10:58.500- 11:03.600* :  A judge here in the UK has ruled that two Russians, a former spy and his daughter, who
*11:03.600- 11:08.040* :  were poisoned by the nerve agent Novi Chok in the southern English city of Salisbury
*11:08.040- 11:13.740* :  six years ago, will not have to give oral evidence at a public inquiry because of fears
*11:13.740- 11:14.620* :  for their safety.
*11:15.140- 11:20.640* :  Sergei and Yulia Scripal have provided written statements instead, Graham Satchel reports.
*11:21.200- 11:27.180* :  The Novi Chok attack in 2018 was aimed at Sergei Scripal, a Russian spy who defected and
*11:27.180- 11:28.780* :  allegedly worked for MI6.
*11:28.940- 11:34.160* :  The poisoning widely believed to have been carried out by Russian agents, left Mr Scripal, his
*11:34.160- 11:37.800* :  daughter Yulia and a police officer in hospital all survived.
*11:38.320- 11:43.780* :  Some weeks later, however, 44-year-old Dawn Sturgis died after being exposed to the poison
*11:44.260- 11:46.520* :  which had been left in a discarded perfume bottle.
*11:46.960- 11:50.920* :  A judge, leading an inquiry into her death, has now decided Mr Scripal and his daughter
*11:50.920- 11:56.580* :  will not give evidence in public, saying another attack remains a real risk if their identity
*11:56.580- 11:58.300* :  or current location is revealed.
*11:58.860- 12:02.740* :  Videoed interviews, recorded by the police in 2018, will also not be shown.
*12:03.160- 12:05.960* :  The judge said playing them would add to the risk of identification.
*12:06.600- 12:09.140* :  The Scripal have provided further written statements.
*12:09.820- 12:14.840* :  Dawn Sturgis' family had wanted the Scripal to give oral evidence to address what they've
*12:14.840- 12:16.420* :  called unanswered questions.
*12:16.600- 12:21.100* :  The inquiry, which is being held instead of an inquest, is due to start next month.
*12:21.620- 12:22.340* :  Graham Satchel.
*12:25.080- 12:25.600* :  Still to come?
*12:25.860- 12:30.080* :  Dogs understand that the things that make life worse living are those things that we do for
*12:30.080- 12:30.720* :  their own sake.
*12:31.300- 12:35.080* :  So can dogs teach us a thing or two about how to be happy?

*13:52.400- 13:53.860* :  Sunday's general election.
*13:54.380- 13:59.980* :  The latest in a series of victories for hard right, anti-immigrant and pro-Russian parties
*13:59.980- 14:00.540* :  in Europe.
*14:01.160- 14:08.060* :  As we record this podcast, the latest projections give the freedom party 29% of the votes, 2% more
*14:08.180- 14:09.900* :  than the conservative people's party.
*14:10.220- 14:14.560* :  At a rally, the leader of the freedom party, Herbert Kickl, said what they had achieved
*14:14.560- 14:15.720* :  was historic.
*14:18.100- 14:20.840* :  We have opened the door to a new era.
*14:21.440- 14:25.380* :  We are now really going to write this new chapter in Austria and history together.
*14:26.340- 14:31.400* :  We have internalised the idea that the people come first and then the chancellor.
*14:31.860- 14:37.360* :  It's a remarkable comeback for the party after it was embroiled in the so-called Ibiza Gate
*14:37.360- 14:43.200* :  scandal five years ago involving members meeting the purported niece of a Russian oligarch.
*14:43.860- 14:48.300* :  On Sunday evening I spoke to our correspondent Bethany Bell, who was on a busy street in Vienna.
*14:48.740- 14:51.780* :  She told me how the freedom party had achieved this turnaround.
*14:52.420- 14:58.280* :  The freedom party has tapped very successfully into a number of voter concerns.
*14:58.540- 15:01.620* :  It began during the COVID-19 pandemic.
*15:01.620- 15:05.020* :  It was very critical of COVID lockdowns.
*15:05.580- 15:10.940* :  And then it's also criticised at rising prices in Austria inflation.
*15:11.500- 15:14.940* :  And crucially, it has criticised migration.
*15:15.500- 15:22.100* :  The leader, Herbert Kickl, has said he wants to build fortress Austria to keep migrants
*15:22.100- 15:22.580* :  out.
*15:23.160- 15:29.820* :  And also one of the other things that freedom party voters were asked about by researchers
*15:29.820- 15:30.220* :  here.
*15:30.680- 15:33.700* :  One of the things that has concerned them, they said, was about war.
*15:34.140- 15:40.820* :  And what the freedom party has said is to stress Austria's neutrality and has been very
*15:40.820- 15:43.620* :  much opposed to EU sanctions on Russia.
*15:44.380- 15:48.820* :  And the freedom party leader Herbert Kickl is a very controversial figure.
*15:49.100- 15:51.320* :  Did he head a coalition government?
*15:52.460- 15:55.220* :  He certainly wants to head a coalition government.
*15:55.760- 16:00.180* :  After the election he said, he extended his hand to all the political parties here.
*16:00.560- 16:05.340* :  He's a very divisive figure, though, during the election campaign one of the things he
*16:05.340- 16:09.820* :  said is that he wants to be a People's Chancellor, a Folk's Chancellor.
*16:10.220- 16:15.480* :  And that worries some Austrians because it was a term used to describe Adolf Hitler
*16:15.980- 16:17.280* :  in the 1930s.
*16:17.380- 16:23.240* :  And there are a number of other issues that other parties say, Mr. Kickl is simply too populist.
*16:23.560- 16:29.920* :  And even tonight, outside the parliament, there was a spontaneous demonstration by people
*16:29.920- 16:33.740* :  who were saying, Kickl must not stay in power, he was a Nazi.
*16:34.040- 16:40.080* :  But nevertheless, this result in Austria illustrates the rising support across Europe for hard
*16:40.080- 16:47.060* :  quite parties who've tapped into concerns about immigration levels and who are also often
*16:47.120- 16:47.980* :  pro-Russian.
*16:49.540- 16:57.120* :  It is another sign of rise in power of groups like that, Mr. Kickl has very close relations
*16:57.120- 17:03.440* :  with the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, who has described himself as wanting an
*17:03.540- 17:10.380* :  illiberal democracy and who has been quite vehemently against EU sanctions on Moscow.
*17:10.920- 17:15.780* :  And one of the things that will be in the mind of Austria's president, Alexander Funderbellen,
*17:15.780- 17:21.140* :  is what they do with that in terms of when it comes to who should get the mandate to
*17:21.140- 17:22.360* :  form a government here.
*17:22.800- 17:24.060* :  Bethany Bell in Vienna.
*17:24.840- 17:29.400* :  In Nepal, thousands of members of the security forces have been taking part in relief from
*17:29.400- 17:35.700* :  rescue efforts after floods and landslides killed around 150 people, at least 50 others
*17:35.880- 17:36.300* :  are missing.
*17:36.880- 17:41.200* :  Schools have been shot for three days as the country struggles to cope with its heaviest
*17:41.200- 17:42.380* :  rains in decades.
*17:43.080- 17:48.460* :  Julian Marshall spoke to the BBC's Sanjay Adakal, who's in the Nipoli capital, Kathmandu.
*17:48.800- 17:54.460* :  There was an incessant rainfall since Friday and on Sunday from morning, there's no
*17:54.460- 17:54.780* :  rainfall.
*17:55.180- 18:01.880* :  It's subsided at least in Kathmandu and water levels in most of the rivers in Kathmandu
*18:01.880- 18:04.820* :  and also outside the city, they are receding.
*18:04.820- 18:10.660* :  So, the weather wise also it is improving and so after we are all counting the flood after
*18:10.660- 18:11.240* :  math now.
*18:11.380- 18:14.740* :  And what were the water levels at the peak of this flooding?
*18:14.980- 18:19.940* :  In during the peak of the flooding, one of the major river in Kathmandu city, Bagmati
*18:19.940- 18:25.720* :  had almost come to the level of the bridge, so it was really a bad situation all around
*18:25.720- 18:28.000* :  Kathmandu and also outside the valley.
*18:28.140- 18:34.500* :  Most rivers, they had a very high current and the water level had reached in the two
*18:34.500- 18:35.360* :  denserest levels.
*18:35.700- 18:38.500* :  And which part of the country was worst affected?
*18:38.880- 18:44.280* :  The flooding happened mostly in East and Central Nepal, Kathmandu valley being one of them.
*18:44.740- 18:49.580* :  In Kathmandu valley alone, there were 2,000 houses inundated, 34 people lost their
*18:49.640- 18:49.900* :  lives.
*18:50.520- 18:56.300* :  In a highway near Kathmandu, some vehicles were found buried under landslide and police
*18:56.300- 19:00.960* :  are just recovering dead bodies from them, they have already recovered at least 27 dead
*19:00.960- 19:01.320* :  bodies.
*19:01.720- 19:06.080* :  These people were headed to Kathmandu when they were caught in a landslide apparently.
*19:06.640- 19:12.000* :  And also another neighboring district of Kathmandu is also quite badly affected.
*19:12.020- 19:16.320* :  So it was mostly concentrated in Central and Eastern Nepal.
*19:19.500- 19:24.400* :  The Hacker is a traditional dance, first performed by New Zealand's indigenous Maori community
*19:24.400- 19:26.620* :  and often associated with its rugby team.
*19:27.260- 19:31.780* :  But for the past 10 years, it's been France which has held the title for the largest
*19:31.780- 19:33.180* :  Hacker ever performed.
*19:33.760- 19:39.420* :  Now New Zealand has reclaimed the world record with 6,000 people taking part.
*19:39.940- 19:44.720* :  Performers travelled from across the country to participate with celebrity guests including
*19:44.720- 19:50.120* :  director, tyker, YTT and the American television presenter Conan O'Brien.
*19:50.560- 19:51.580* :  Miki Pristo reports.
*19:55.040- 20:00.280* :  This is the Benz rugby team from New Zealand who are famous for their enthusiastic performances
*20:00.280- 20:02.100* :  of the Hacker before a match.
*20:02.660- 20:07.780* :  For the Maulies though, it was a traditional way to welcome a visiting tribe and to inspire
*20:07.780- 20:09.420* :  warriors going out to battle.
*20:10.160- 20:15.340* :  Perhaps surprisingly the previous world record was held by France, who did the Hacker with
*20:15.380- 20:16.680* :  4,000 people.
*20:17.200- 20:22.580* :  New Zealand have now taken back the crown with a crowd of men, women and children at a stadium
*20:22.580- 20:23.200* :  in Auckland.
*20:28.880- 20:34.080* :  The Hacker wasn't always coordinated, but they nevertheless chanted to the rhythmic movement
*20:34.080- 20:39.440* :  of arms and legs, and they spent the Hacker occasionally pulled frightening faces.
*20:39.960- 20:43.560* :  The record was confirmed by a band from the Guinness World Records.
*20:43.620- 20:50.500* :  While the official number is still being counted because it's a large number, I can safely
*20:50.500- 20:56.480* :  say that you have surpassed the record to beat officially amazing.
*20:56.920- 21:01.160* :  Initial estimates suggested there had been 6,000 doing this particular Hacker.
*21:01.740- 21:06.200* :  The organisers said it had been a matter of national pride that the record for a New
*21:06.200- 21:09.440* :  Zealand tradition should be held by New Zealand.
*21:11.500- 21:14.740* :  Ken Dogs teach us a thing or two about how to be happy.
*21:15.260- 21:19.280* :  Do we humans worry too much or simply expect too much out of life?
*21:19.900- 21:23.120* :  Would we be happier if we channeled our inner dogs?
*21:23.760- 21:28.200* :  Well, Mark Rowlands is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Miami and has just written
*21:28.200- 21:33.360* :  a book called The Happiness of Dogs, why the unexamined life is most worth living.
*21:34.100- 21:38.480* :  Energy explains how we can learn from our canine friends about how to live in the moment
*21:38.480- 21:43.320* :  and be contented with our existence, he's been speaking to Rebecca Kesby.
*21:43.700- 21:47.640* :  One of the things the dogs know that we've forgotten is there are certain things in life
*21:47.640- 21:51.680* :  we do for their own sake and there are certain things in life we do for the sake of something
*21:51.720- 21:52.000* :  else.
*21:52.260- 21:54.740* :  Most obviously we worked in order to get paid.
*21:55.300- 21:59.000* :  I think dogs understand that the things that make life worth living are those things that
*21:59.000- 22:00.340* :  we do for their own sake.
*22:00.660- 22:04.280* :  Like playing, sleeping, eating, these sorts of things.
*22:04.900- 22:09.540* :  Yeah, all the things that they would do just because they want to, not because anyone's
*22:09.540- 22:10.720* :  making them do it.
*22:11.220- 22:14.260* :  And we assume that they're happy with this life.
*22:14.400- 22:15.580* :  How are we grading that?
*22:15.940- 22:20.180* :  Well, I mean, how do we know that anyone is happy where the dog or human basically through
*22:20.180- 22:22.920* :  close personal knowledge and observation of behavior?
*22:23.140- 22:27.760* :  I take my dog every day running along the canal, he chases a guana as they jump into the
*22:27.760- 22:32.100* :  water, they swim to the other side and they stay over the other side for the rest of
*22:32.100- 22:32.500* :  the day.
*22:32.860- 22:36.800* :  When the next morning comes around, they're back on our side and he repeats the whole thing
*22:36.800- 22:37.720* :  over and over again.
*22:37.780- 22:42.240* :  This kind of repetitive activity, the aims only of his own continuation, that is when
*22:42.240- 22:43.040* :  I think he's happiest.
*22:43.740- 22:49.480* :  I guess it's what trying to be more simple in our lives and take pleasure in simple things,
*22:49.480- 22:50.520* :  is that the message?
*22:51.000- 22:55.760* :  Well, we developed a capacity that's very limited in dogs and other animals, a capacity
*22:55.760- 22:56.560* :  for reflection.
*22:56.740- 23:00.840* :  And reflection is the ability to think about yourself by what you're doing and why you're
*23:00.880- 23:01.380* :  doing it.
*23:01.480- 23:04.380* :  It has great advantages, but there are also disadvantages.
*23:05.600- 23:10.720* :  As a result, we became very anxious sort of timorous creatures who are always second-guessing
*23:10.720- 23:11.220* :  ourselves.
*23:12.020- 23:16.740* :  Instead of just going about our lives and believing things and wandering things, we worry
*23:16.740- 23:20.260* :  about our lives, we worry about what it is, we believe, what it is we want.
*23:20.560- 23:24.280* :  And this makes this trouble creatures in a way that other animals, particularly dogs,
*23:24.280- 23:25.460* :  I think, are not.
*23:25.460- 23:29.460* :  This is a sort of habitual tendency if you would be used to over-complicate things.
*23:30.120- 23:34.720* :  I think thinking about animals, what they do, is a very good antidote to this basic
*23:34.720- 23:36.960* :  human tendency towards over-complication.
*23:37.400- 23:42.340* :  So if anyone was listening and wanted to become more dog, what would be your top tip?
*23:42.520- 23:43.920* :  Don't bother because you can't.
*23:44.840- 23:49.940* :  The closest we've become to dogs when we were children, and I think as life goes on,
*23:49.940- 23:54.760* :  capacity's reflection grow and grow and grow, we basically have lost that ability.
*23:55.340- 24:00.880* :  Professor Mark Rowland's author of the book, The Happiness of Dogs, Why the Unexamined Life
*24:00.880- 24:02.340* :  Is Most Worth Living.
*24:03.320- 24:07.600* :  The Eurasian Country of Georgia is famous for being the birthplace of wine and Joseph
*24:07.600- 24:13.900* :  Stalin, but it also has another important cultural export, that is polyphonic singing, where
*24:13.920- 24:19.440* :  two or more melodies are sung by multiple voices, and that long cherished tradition has drawn
*24:19.440- 24:22.580* :  choirs from around the world to Georgia in the past week.
*24:23.140- 24:29.260* :  Professor Rehan Demetri spoke to them to find out what makes Georgian songs so spellbinding.
*24:35.240- 24:40.120* :  This is a German choir singing a Georgian classic Alilol.
*24:40.720- 24:43.340* :  The choir formed over Zoom during the pandemic.
*24:48.220- 24:54.700* :  Stalin and Sabine are thrilled that their choir is performing in Georgia itself for the first time.
*24:55.300- 25:02.000* :  We are all practicing in small ensembles all over Germany and Austria, it's hard to imagine
*25:02.000- 25:03.440* :  that we are in Georgia.
*25:04.240- 25:11.020* :  We love the music so much, and to hear the music makes really goosebumps.
*25:11.620- 25:11.760* :  Yes.
*25:12.240- 25:18.240* :  Can you explain for those who don't know, those who never practice singing, what is it about?
*25:18.240- 25:22.320* :  Well, specifically this music that makes you feel this way.
*25:22.820- 25:30.160* :  It touched me, and one song, Georgian song, could be heard so different, not like one song
*25:30.160- 25:36.200* :  always the same, always in another feeling, but always deep.
*25:43.740- 25:49.820* :  Georgian polyphony is a type of music featuring multiple vocal parts, typically three distinct
*25:49.820- 25:55.140* :  groups of voices involving harmonies, sung without instrumental accompaniment.
*26:01.720- 26:07.420* :  International choirs from Europe, US and Canada have gathered in Tbilisi for the country's
*26:07.560- 26:13.700* :  annual folk festival, to perform alongside Georgian ensembles, sharing their passion for
*26:13.700- 26:18.360* :  this enchanting music and showcasing their own traditional music.
*26:19.240- 26:29.640* :  We are we all important us, where we are.
*26:30.460- 26:33.180* :  a Welsh lullaby by Trio Samaya.
*26:33.880- 26:37.820* :  They are part of a bigger community choir known as Kakali,
*26:38.080- 26:40.240* :  which means Walnut in Georgian.
*26:40.240- 26:40.700* :  Oh, what?
*26:40.980- 26:43.540* :  Yeah, now they're in season, the green ones.
*26:45.300- 26:45.900* :  We're just nuts.
*26:47.720- 26:50.280* :  Liz Wumsy from the Trio Samaya describes
*26:50.280- 26:53.720* :  the effect Georgian polyphonic singing has on her.
*26:55.000- 26:57.220* :  I was a music teacher a long time ago.
*26:57.220- 26:58.980* :  That was my training initially,
*26:58.980- 27:03.220* :  but it was the Georgian songs that just opened my heart,
*27:03.940- 27:06.240* :  singing in my lower register voice
*27:06.660- 27:09.540* :  and changed my life, actually.
*27:09.580- 27:14.280* :  It is a heartfelt experience of open-heartedness.
*27:15.160- 27:16.620* :  I don't know what it is.
*27:17.000- 27:20.720* :  I don't think there's a word for it, but it met my soul.
*27:32.360- 27:34.640* :  That report by Rayhan Dimitri.
*27:37.360- 27:38.580* :  And that's all from us for now,
*27:38.580- 27:41.820* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
