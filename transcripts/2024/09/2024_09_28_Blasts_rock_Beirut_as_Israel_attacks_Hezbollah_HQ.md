*00:23.940- 00:28.060* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we

*01:18.240- 01:21.580* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:21.580- 01:26.540* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Saturday, the 28th of September, the Lebanese
*01:26.540- 01:30.720* :  capital Beirut has been hit by the heaviest Israeli strikes of the war so far.
*01:31.220- 01:34.300* :  Higher-rise buildings were flattened with at least six dead.
*01:34.780- 01:37.460* :  Israel says it was targeting the headquarters of Hezbollah.
*01:37.460- 01:40.840* :  The fate of the group's leader, Hassan Nazrallah, is unknown.
*01:41.440- 01:45.340* :  The Israeli Prime Minister gave the go ahead just moments after addressing the United
*01:45.340- 01:45.760* :  Nations.
*01:49.020- 01:54.060* :  Also in the podcast, at least 33 people have been killed after Hurricane Helene came ashore
*01:54.060- 01:59.900* :  in Florida and a couple of days ago, the biggest leader of Haiti threatened my life.
*01:59.900- 02:05.600* :  He published two videos and attacking me personally and saying he's coming for me.
*02:05.880- 02:10.260* :  How armed gangs in Haiti are targeting journalists who report on their violence.
*02:14.860- 02:19.660* :  Just minutes after the Israeli Prime Minister addressed the world's top diplomatic body,
*02:19.660- 02:24.860* :  the United Nations in New York, he gave the green light to his armed forces to launch
*02:24.860- 02:27.440* :  a devastating strike on Hezbollah in Lebanon.
*02:34.280- 02:39.700* :  The massive blasts in the heavily populated area of southern Beirut just after 6pm local
*02:39.700- 02:44.640* :  time flattened high-rise buildings and sent huge plumes of smoke into the air.
*02:44.640- 02:49.900* :  The strikes reportedly targeted the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nazrallah, with an Israeli
*02:49.900- 02:52.980* :  official saying his death would be a game-changer in the conflict.
*02:53.540- 02:58.900* :  Lebanese media reported that he was unhurt and had been taken to a safe place, but that
*02:58.900- 03:00.060* :  hasn't been confirmed.
*03:00.220- 03:05.140* :  The Lebanese health ministry said six people had died and more than 90 been injured.
*03:05.720- 03:09.820* :  I heard more about the strike, the biggest of the war so far, from our correspondent
*03:09.820- 03:11.200* :  in Beirut and a foster.
*03:11.660- 03:17.840* :  This was heard and felt right across Beirut, I was just a few kilometres away, and the
*03:17.840- 03:24.960* :  sound of those seven or eight just repeated very, very loud bangs was different to anything
*03:24.980- 03:27.480* :  that had been heard before in the last few days.
*03:28.060- 03:33.040* :  It looks like several buildings have been raised to the ground, well looking at pictures
*03:33.040- 03:37.260* :  of rescue teams in there digging through the rubble, trying to find survivors.
*03:37.700- 03:42.900* :  What Israel say is that they were targeting at Hezbollah's essentially headquarters,
*03:43.580- 03:49.340* :  which they said that Hezbollah had deliberately located in a civilian area, and it's worth
*03:49.340- 03:53.200* :  saying that this particular area down here it's called in the southern suburbs of Beirut
*03:53.280- 03:57.520* :  is a Hezbollah stronghold, it's an area that they hold, but it is a place where people
*03:57.520- 04:01.120* :  live, where families with children live and go about their daily lives.
*04:01.600- 04:07.400* :  Now from what Israeli sources have been telling the media, it sounds like they were targeting
*04:07.500- 04:12.700* :  the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah in some kind of decapitation there, but do we
*04:12.700- 04:15.720* :  know what's happened to him and the impact on Hezbollah?
*04:16.480- 04:20.800* :  It is kind of murky because we're hearing different things from different sides as you
*04:20.800- 04:26.900* :  might expect at this stage, so Israeli media are reporting that Hassan Nasrallah, as you
*04:26.900- 04:32.480* :  say, the leader of Hezbollah was the target, obviously somebody that Israel were very keen
*04:32.480- 04:37.700* :  to target what we're hearing out of Iran at the same time, is something sort of very
*04:37.700- 04:38.180* :  different.
*04:38.860- 04:42.780* :  They're saying that he's fine and well, that was what they were saying originally, but
*04:42.780- 04:47.800* :  then it also seems in some Iranian media this idea is starting to creep in that, you
*04:47.800- 04:52.380* :  know, any leader of any organization has people who are ready to step up and take their
*04:52.380- 04:57.420* :  place if they're not around anymore, but at the moment it is, it's just a bit too early
*04:57.420- 04:57.880* :  to tell.
*04:58.560- 05:03.140* :  Meanwhile, Hezbollah has tried to show that it is still a military force, its fired
*05:03.140- 05:07.800* :  rockets into Israel, Israel has hit back so the fighting goes on.
*05:08.680- 05:08.980* :  It does.
*05:09.300- 05:13.320* :  I mean, what you've seen just in the last couple of hours from Hezbollah is sort of very
*05:13.320- 05:16.960* :  similar to the rhythm that we've seen for the last week or so.
*05:16.960- 05:22.220* :  I think the question is whether or not there is going to be a more significant response,
*05:22.320- 05:25.760* :  and again, it's difficult to tell, you know, if you look at, for example, an event
*05:25.760- 05:31.100* :  which happened a few weeks ago now, which was the killing of Isnaha Haneer, the leader
*05:31.100- 05:37.380* :  of Hamassah's political bureau, a huge response was expected to that, you know, possibly
*05:37.380- 05:41.140* :  around joining in with that response, but that hasn't happened just yet.
*05:41.720- 05:45.340* :  We know that these airstrikes that we've seen over the last week in the south of Lebanon
*05:45.920- 05:51.160* :  and in the Becar Valley as well, Israel say that they were designed to degrade Hezbollah's
*05:51.160- 05:55.980* :  military capability, so they said they were targeting weapon storage, missile launch sites,
*05:56.440- 05:59.960* :  although it is also important to say that civilians have been killed in those operations
*05:59.960- 06:02.200* :  as well, at least 50 children have been killed.
*06:02.800- 06:05.760* :  So what can Hezbollah do next?
*06:06.200- 06:11.100* :  And organizations allied with them, the Houthis, for example, in Yemen, or around themselves,
*06:11.100- 06:16.560* :  you know, what they might consider to be a reasonable and proportionate response is something
*06:16.560- 06:18.000* :  that we will wait and see.
*06:18.640- 06:23.800* :  Of course, Lebanon has been through difficult times, terrible times over the past few decades,
*06:23.800- 06:29.940* :  and indeed in recent years, the economic collapse, that huge explosion in the port.
*06:30.140- 06:32.860* :  What is the mood in Beirut now?
*06:33.920- 06:39.020* :  We know I'm looking out over the port, in fact, as I'm speaking to you now, over that
*06:39.060- 06:43.300* :  area of the city that was so badly damaged back in 2020.
*06:43.420- 06:47.860* :  And, yeah, I mean, people here in Lebanon have had an extraordinarily difficult time,
*06:47.860- 06:52.840* :  in areas of crises, you know, whether it be electricity, you know, lack of electricity,
*06:52.840- 06:55.080* :  lack of food, political crises.
*06:55.080- 06:59.620* :  It's been an enormously difficult time, and certainly anybody you speak to here doesn't
*06:59.620- 07:04.220* :  feel strong enough, frankly, to face a war at the moment.
*07:04.900- 07:08.860* :  But right now, you know, even though a ceasefire is being talked about two days ago, this
*07:08.860- 07:13.660* :  is the opposite of that, and it's hard to see how any kind of de-escalation can be achieved.
*07:14.380- 07:19.300* :  A foster in Beirut, well, as we record this podcast, Israel has been carrying out new
*07:19.300- 07:23.200* :  airstrikes, and what it said were weapon sites in southern Beirut.
*07:23.580- 07:28.600* :  After ordering residents of specific buildings to leave, they also attack the city of Tire.
*07:28.600- 07:33.740* :  France said the attacks must be halted, while the Iranian president said Israel was to
*07:33.740- 07:35.780* :  blame for a blatant war crime.
*07:36.380- 07:41.940* :  Joe Biden has expressed concern about an escalation and directed the Pentagon to adjust US
*07:41.940- 07:44.500* :  force posture in the Middle East as necessary.
*07:45.120- 07:49.760* :  The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was a precarious moment for the Middle
*07:49.760- 07:53.040* :  East and the world, and called once again for a truce.
*07:53.320- 07:58.800* :  It is a legitimate and important objective for Israel to, again, create an environment in
*07:58.800- 08:00.680* :  which people can get back to their homes.
*08:01.000- 08:03.140* :  The question is, what's the best way to do that?
*08:03.180- 08:06.640* :  What is the most effective, sustainable way to do that?
*08:07.280- 08:12.480* :  We believe in many other countries who joined us in putting out a call for a ceasefire
*08:12.480- 08:17.300* :  for 21 days, believe that the best way to do that is through diplomacy, through a ceasefire
*08:17.300- 08:18.300* :  and then reaching an agreement.
*08:19.280- 08:24.580* :  Antony Blinken speaking at the United Nations in New York, well, earlier on Friday, there
*08:24.580- 08:29.960* :  was a walk out by some diplomats as the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepared
*08:29.960- 08:31.940* :  to address the General Assembly there.
*08:36.520- 08:37.380* :  Order, please.
*08:41.760- 08:47.160* :  Mr. Netanyahu was then cheered by his supporters in the chamber as he promised to continue attacking
*08:47.160- 08:52.160* :  both Hezbollah and Hamas and making no reference to any ceasefire discussions.
*08:52.760- 08:57.760* :  He accused the UN itself of being an anti-Semitic swamp and called on other countries to help
*08:57.760- 09:00.480* :  fight what he said was a common enemy, Iran.
*09:01.020- 09:06.180* :  Will your nations stand with Israel, will you stand with democracy and peace, or will
*09:06.180- 09:12.480* :  you stand with Iran, a brutal dictatorship that subjugates its own people, exports terrorism
*09:12.480- 09:13.600* :  across the globe?
*09:14.320- 09:16.940* :  For too long, the world is appeased, Iran.
*09:17.400- 09:23.120* :  It turns a blind eye to its internal repression, it turns a blind eye to its external aggression.
*09:23.760- 09:28.380* :  Well, that appeasement must end, and that appeasement must end now.
*09:29.280- 09:33.600* :  Our security correspondent Frank Gardner gave us his assessment of Mr. Netanyahu's speech.
*09:34.000- 09:38.240* :  Benjamin Netanyahu is right at the top of his rhetorical form.
*09:38.240- 09:40.740* :  He is a very accomplished orator.
*09:40.740- 09:44.260* :  I don't know how much that speech he wrote, but he suddenly delivered it with gusto.
*09:44.800- 09:47.000* :  But he's only telling a part of the story here.
*09:47.480- 09:52.980* :  Let's not forget that the curse of October the 7th, as he put it, the disastrous day
*09:52.980- 09:59.040* :  for Israel last year when they got raided by Hamas in that barbaric and sadistic raid,
*09:59.680- 10:00.920* :  that happened on his watch.
*10:01.420- 10:07.280* :  So there is a lot of antipathy towards him in Israel for letting Israel's guard down
*10:07.280- 10:07.840* :  at that point.
*10:07.840- 10:12.980* :  He made no mention of this speech of the fact that Israel carried out an airstrike in April
*10:12.980- 10:19.460* :  on April 1st on a diplomatic mission, the Iranian consulate in Damascus, which killed
*10:19.460- 10:22.740* :  12 people, and that's what triggered the Iranian response.
*10:23.400- 10:29.180* :  Yes, Israel wants peace, and Israel has been unfairly attacked in many cases, and it is
*10:29.180- 10:31.540* :  under constant threat for a lot of people.
*10:32.220- 10:38.540* :  But Benjamin Netanyahu is seen by many, including in the U.S. State Department, as an obstacle
*10:38.540- 10:44.920* :  to the ultimate settling of the Palestine-Israeli question, namely, giving the Palestinians
*10:44.920- 10:46.000* :  a state of their own.
*10:46.640- 10:48.660* :  Our security correspondent Frank Gardner.
*10:49.320- 10:53.300* :  Other news now, and at least 33 people have died in the United States.
*10:53.800- 10:58.360* :  After Hurricane Helene crashed ashore in Florida late on Thursday night, local time.
*10:58.460- 11:04.280* :  Helene, which had been a category 4 storm, has now been downgraded to a tropical depression.
*11:04.820- 11:07.580* :  But Georgia and the Carolinas are still under flood alerts.
*11:08.120- 11:13.440* :  Dave Malkoff from our U.S. partner CBS News reported from Atlanta, Georgia, while standing
*11:13.440- 11:14.840* :  in water up to his waist.
*11:15.240- 11:23.100* :  After the storm came on shore, what's 270 miles from where I am standing right now?
*11:23.500- 11:24.380* :  This is Atlanta.
*11:24.380- 11:28.240* :  It's in North Georgia, the state above Florida.
*11:28.860- 11:35.020* :  That shows how widespread, fast-moving, and strong Helene actually was.
*11:35.340- 11:38.780* :  This is an apartment complex, this car, completely underwater.
*11:39.280- 11:43.220* :  There's a couple of them that are underwater all the way up to the rooftop.
*11:43.800- 11:48.580* :  There are lots of people who are in these apartments back here.
*11:49.180- 11:52.620* :  Dave Malkoff of CBS News in Atlanta, Georgia.
*11:53.260- 11:59.080* :  Every month, people in Brazil, who are on social benefits, spend half a billion dollars
*11:59.080- 12:02.560* :  in gambling, most on football and other sporting bets.
*12:02.960- 12:07.360* :  Now the government is considering blocking those who receive such payments from spending
*12:07.360- 12:09.020* :  the money in online gambling.
*12:09.400- 12:10.820* :  So how big an issue is it?
*12:11.120- 12:13.500* :  I asked our America's regional editor, Leonardo Russia.
*12:13.920- 12:18.480* :  It's huge, and it's very embarrassing for the government, because a lot of that money
*12:18.480- 12:23.680* :  is coming from the poorest in society who get this benefit, which amounts to about a hundred
*12:23.680- 12:29.140* :  dollars a month to basically pay for basic costs of food and education of their children.
*12:29.780- 12:32.620* :  And they're spending their money on betting companies.
*12:32.620- 12:34.840* :  There are about 3,000 of them in Brazil.
*12:35.480- 12:41.260* :  And another aspect of that is this benefit, they normally go to the women in the family
*12:41.260- 12:41.900* :  to the mothers.
*12:42.560- 12:48.760* :  So it's like child benefits, and most of the people addicted are women, and it's targeting
*12:48.760- 12:55.440* :  women who are poor in society using state government money to go to very profitable companies.
*12:55.860- 13:00.420* :  Online gambling is quite a new thing in Brazil, but you were saying it's taken off quite
*13:01.240- 13:01.540* :  spectacularly.
*13:01.720- 13:03.460* :  It's amazing everywhere you look.
*13:03.500- 13:08.340* :  For example, the last time I looked at 15 of the twenth, I think now 18 of the 20 teams
*13:08.340- 13:11.480* :  in the top football division I sponsor by betting companies.
*13:12.000- 13:14.140* :  You have a music events.
*13:14.640- 13:18.680* :  The volleyball federation is sponsored by betting companies.
*13:18.680- 13:19.360* :  They're everywhere.
*13:19.360- 13:23.600* :  They're also involved now with crime, because it's been used by money laundering.
*13:23.600- 13:28.580* :  There's some scandals that have happened with famous singers and politicians.
*13:29.240- 13:30.400* :  It's quite overwhelming.
*13:30.940- 13:35.340* :  And that since regulation of betting was done a year ago.
*13:35.340- 13:39.380* :  So two previous governments and the current government, left wing government, are involved
*13:39.380- 13:39.880* :  in that.
*13:40.240- 13:44.140* :  The government thought it was a good idea to balance the books, and now they are in that
*13:44.140- 13:46.120* :  situation, which is very embarrassing.
*13:46.320- 13:48.380* :  Yeah, I mean, how will this latest measure work?
*13:48.380- 13:52.140* :  Is it even possible to stop people using their money in any way they want?
*13:52.140- 13:56.420* :  They'll try to use like, it's equivalent of the social security number of people who
*13:56.420- 13:58.280* :  get the benefits and block them.
*13:58.560- 14:03.720* :  There's another problem in Brazil that you have this immediate transfer from bank to bank
*14:03.720- 14:08.220* :  of people using their mobile phones, the pioneering system in Brazil called PICS, so people
*14:08.220- 14:11.020* :  do it all the time they can do on the spot.
*14:11.460- 14:14.300* :  And we all know that online gambling is highly objective.
*14:14.700- 14:16.100* :  People at home, they're doing bad.
*14:16.500- 14:20.660* :  And when you see the evidence, it's really shocking and it's a concern for the government.
*14:20.880- 14:22.040* :  I don't know if it's going to work.
*14:22.360- 14:24.860* :  America's regional editor, Leonardo Roshan.
*14:27.500- 14:29.300* :  And still to come on the global news podcast.
*14:29.300- 14:33.560* :  I don't go up to a person in a wheelchair and I don't ask them, why are you in a wheelchair?
*14:33.960- 14:36.360* :  Somebody of the face with difference is no different to that.
*14:36.820- 14:41.640* :  I'd like this experience to educate people about what it might be like to live with a
*14:41.640- 14:44.880* :  face with difference and let's all be a bit kind to do each other.
*14:45.280- 14:51.020* :  The man asked to leave a restaurant because his face was scaring other customers, now campaigning
*15:01.760- 15:01.880* :  to educate people about his condition.

*16:03.160- 16:07.500* :  On Thursday, it looked as if Vladimir Zelensky would head home from his trip to America
*16:07.500- 16:09.340* :  without seeing Donald Trump.
*16:09.380- 16:14.500* :  The former US President has been critical of the Ukrainian leader, while Republicans
*16:14.500- 16:20.140* :  in Congress are furious over Mr. Zelensky's visit to a key swing state with senior Democrats
*16:20.140- 16:20.740* :  in tow.
*16:21.240- 16:25.780* :  But in the end, Mr. Trump relented and confirmed he would meet the wartime president
*16:25.780- 16:26.660* :  after all.
*16:26.900- 16:29.180* :  So how did their talks go at Trump Tower?
*16:29.720- 16:31.800* :  This was what the former US President had to say.
*16:32.180- 16:34.960* :  We're leading in the polls, so we'll see how it all works out.
*16:35.060- 16:35.960* :  Hopefully it'll work out.
*16:35.960- 16:41.320* :  But if it does, we're going to work very much with both parties to try and get this settled.
*16:41.920- 16:44.260* :  It has to end at some point at the end.
*16:44.260- 16:48.420* :  This country has gone through hell like a few countries that have ever, like it's happened
*16:48.420- 16:48.900* :  to anywhere.
*16:48.980- 16:52.120* :  Nobody's ever seen anything like a terrible situation.
*16:52.860- 16:57.580* :  For his part, President Zelensky explained why it was important for him to meet both Donald
*16:57.580- 16:58.940* :  Trump and Kamala Harris.
*16:59.220- 17:03.140* :  After November, we don't know who is on the America to decide who will do the president.
*17:03.640- 17:09.240* :  But we understand that till November, we can't stop, we have to do it, we will try on
*17:09.240- 17:13.020* :  the battlefield without our heroic soldiers when we understand it.
*17:13.120- 17:18.680* :  After November, we have to decide and we hope that the transfer of the United States
*17:19.020- 17:21.960* :  will be very strong and we can't in it.
*17:21.960- 17:25.100* :  That's why I decided to meet with both candidates.
*17:25.620- 17:29.080* :  Our correspondent in New York, Nalitaovi, covered the talks for us.
*17:29.180- 17:32.300* :  So did she observe anything new in Mr. Trump's approach to Ukraine?
*17:32.640- 17:37.560* :  Well we still didn't get any details about how he expects to end the war.
*17:37.680- 17:43.840* :  He said that he wants to see a fair deal and that it would happen at the right time.
*17:43.840- 17:49.020* :  But he reiterated that the war should stop and when he was asked and pushed on kind of
*17:49.020- 17:52.520* :  what was fair, he said it was too early to say that.
*17:52.520- 17:57.880* :  The dynamic between the two men was interesting too because Donald Trump said he was honored
*17:57.880- 18:00.980* :  to have President Zelensky there and he said they had a good relationship.
*18:01.540- 18:06.880* :  But he also put in that he had a great relationship with President Putin as well to which Zelensky
*18:06.880- 18:11.080* :  kind of jumped in and said I hope we have more good relations between us.
*18:11.580- 18:16.620* :  So certainly for President Zelensky it was a victory just to have the meeting but not
*18:16.620- 18:20.360* :  really clear what concrete ideas President Trump had.
*18:20.360- 18:22.240* :  It seems like the two still have different ideas.
*18:22.640- 18:26.020* :  Yeah, I was going to ask if the two men had patched up their differences but it sounds
*18:26.020- 18:30.360* :  like they made a little bit of progress but perhaps not gone all the way.
*18:30.780- 18:34.980* :  There was some tension before this meeting, even questions about whether it was going to
*18:34.980- 18:35.580* :  even happen.
*18:35.580- 18:41.140* :  Donald Trump was very upset when President Zelensky visited an ammunition factory in the
*18:41.140- 18:43.080* :  battleground state of Pennsylvania.
*18:43.740- 18:49.020* :  He kind of saw that as him wanting to help Kamala Harris win the presidential election
*18:49.100- 18:55.020* :  and even called him the greatest salesman in history who leaves with billions of dollars
*18:55.020- 18:57.140* :  every time he leaves the United States.
*18:57.860- 19:01.780* :  And I was actually at a press conference at Trump Tower yesterday when they actually asked
*19:01.780- 19:06.420* :  Donald Trump why did you decide to essentially change your mind and meet with him.
*19:06.840- 19:11.500* :  But it seems like Donald Trump agreed that this was an important meeting to have and it seems
*19:11.500- 19:13.180* :  like they both are patched up.
*19:13.180- 19:18.240* :  He said that the Zelensky was a man of steel for how he handled a call years ago which
*19:18.240- 19:20.340* :  led to Trump's impeachment in the House.
*19:20.660- 19:22.300* :  Neda Talfiq in New York.
*19:22.460- 19:26.740* :  And just a reminder that we're doing a special Q&A podcast on the US presidential election
*19:26.740- 19:27.940* :  in a couple of weeks' time.
*19:27.940- 19:32.760* :  So if you have a question you'd like to put to our AmeriCast colleagues in Washington,
*19:32.860- 19:40.800* :  then please send us an email to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk or tweet us at Global Newspod
*19:41.040- 19:43.580* :  and thanks to those who have already sent in voice notes.
*19:44.540- 19:50.140* :  Three months after the deployment of 400 Kenyan police officials to Haiti, gang violence
*19:50.140- 19:54.100* :  there continues to plague the lives of those in the Caribbean nation.
*19:54.140- 19:59.580* :  A report by the UN Rights Office has highlighted the scale of the problems in Haiti.
*20:00.200- 20:03.880* :  More than three and a half thousand people have been killed since the start of this year
*20:04.180- 20:08.360* :  and the gangs who control much of the capital have been recruiting large numbers of children.
*20:08.980- 20:11.580* :  So what is life like for ordinary Haitians?
*20:11.580- 20:18.440* :  Julian Marshall spoke to Whitlow Meringor, editor-in-chief at the local news organization Aibo Post.
*20:19.080- 20:24.940* :  As a journalist first, I'm facing threats that are specific to my field, for instance,
*20:25.720- 20:32.160* :  a couple of days ago, back on Wednesday, the biggest gang leader of Haiti barbecue threatened
*20:32.700- 20:33.220* :  my life.
*20:33.340- 20:40.380* :  He published two videos about me questioning my reporting and attacking me personally
*20:40.420- 20:42.080* :  and saying he's coming for me.
*20:42.140- 20:49.180* :  So right now I have concerns for my own safety and I also have concerns for the safety of
*20:49.180- 20:52.720* :  my team here working for Aibo Post locally.
*20:52.720- 21:00.860* :  But on a more broad and general level, the gang is extremely vicious in Haiti back, let's
*21:00.860- 21:06.300* :  say, more than two months ago when the Kenyan force arrived in Haiti, people had high hopes
*21:06.380- 21:09.640* :  that they would fight effectively against the gangs.
*21:09.640- 21:15.960* :  But today we are not seeing important results which regards to how they are tackling the
*21:15.960- 21:16.300* :  gangs.
*21:16.780- 21:17.740* :  It's quite the opposite.
*21:18.480- 21:20.100* :  Kidnapping is making a comeback.
*21:20.300- 21:26.460* :  The force is complaining of a lack of resources, a lack of personnel because they are about
*21:26.460- 21:28.800* :  400 in the country.
*21:29.420- 21:37.200* :  The mission is supposed to be helping the Haiti security forces to fight the gangs.
*21:37.300- 21:45.380* :  However, they have yet to register any substantial victory against the gangs.
*21:45.380- 21:48.020* :  And it's a problem for poorer parents.
*21:48.020- 21:51.540* :  It's also a problem for places outside of the capital.
*21:51.920- 21:57.940* :  You have places like Archibald, for instance, which is a very important place in terms of
*21:57.940- 22:04.300* :  agriculture in Haiti, where the gang problem skyrocketed in the past months.
*22:04.900- 22:11.880* :  You have other places that were usually not really touched by the gang violence problem,
*22:11.880- 22:18.600* :  but you are seeing more and more gang members leaving the Haiti capital and going to places
*22:18.600- 22:23.740* :  outside of poorer parents to sell chaos and violence and destruction.
*22:24.040- 22:31.900* :  A new M-report accuses these armed gangs of using sexual violence to punish spread fear
*22:31.900- 22:34.180* :  and subjugate populations.
*22:34.360- 22:36.060* :  Does that sound familiar to you?
*22:36.360- 22:36.920* :  Absolutely.
*22:37.280- 22:45.360* :  When gang members come to your neighborhood generally, you know, virtually every aspect of life
*22:45.360- 22:48.580* :  is affected by such presence.
*22:48.580- 22:57.080* :  They burn down houses of people, they force folks to leave their homes, they rape women
*22:57.080- 23:02.520* :  in a sometimes systematic ways, and they assassinate people.
*23:02.660- 23:10.300* :  It's a very brutal situation and because actually the force is seen as ineffective, we are
*23:10.300- 23:12.800* :  seeing them becoming more brazen.
*23:12.940- 23:18.820* :  For instance, a couple of days ago, we have a report that there were shootings by gang members
*23:19.380- 23:25.920* :  close to the army's offices, which is actually close to the Haiti National Palace.
*23:26.680- 23:32.620* :  So they are not just controlling more territories, they are not just attacking places that they
*23:32.620- 23:39.760* :  did not attack before, but they feel so at ease that they can, you know, try to attack
*23:39.760- 23:45.560* :  other state institutions in a context where you still have this Canadian force in the country
*23:45.560- 23:50.440* :  and it's another indication of the ineffectiveness of the Canadian force.
*23:50.860- 23:53.260* :  With La Merancourt, a journalist in Haiti.
*23:54.240- 23:58.780* :  Here in the UK, three climate activists have carried out a repeat protest by throwing
*23:58.780- 24:01.040* :  soup over Vincent Van Gogh paintings.
*24:01.560- 24:05.960* :  The action at the National Gallery in London came shortly after two of their fellow
*24:05.960- 24:10.600* :  just-stop-oil campaigners were sentenced to prison for doing almost exactly the same
*24:10.600- 24:11.760* :  thing two years ago.
*24:12.160- 24:16.880* :  In a video posted on X, the three protestors can be seen throwing orange-coloured liquid
*24:16.880- 24:21.380* :  over two sunflower paintings, one of which was attacked back in 2022.
*24:32.080- 24:37.460* :  The trio took off their coats to reveal just-stop-oil t-shirts and sat down in front of the
*24:37.500- 24:38.760* :  soup-covered canvases.
*24:39.220- 24:43.000* :  One of the protestors asked the crowd, when will fossil fuel executives and politicians
*24:43.000- 24:46.960* :  be held accountable for the damage they are imposing on every living thing?
*24:47.420- 24:49.880* :  Our correspondent Divya Talwar has more details.
*24:50.380- 24:54.280* :  The National Gallery confirmed that three people had been arrested, but that the paintings
*24:54.280- 24:55.500* :  were undamaged.
*24:55.960- 25:02.160* :  Just an hour before, hundreds more just-stop-oil supporters had gathered outside a southern crown
*25:02.160- 25:02.540* :  court.
*25:03.080- 25:09.600* :  As Jarge Christopher Hare sentenced 22-year-old Anna Holland and 23-year-old Phoebe Plummer,
*25:09.980- 25:16.000* :  the pair targeted another of Van Gogh's sunflower paintings, with two tins of Heinz tomato
*25:16.000- 25:18.120* :  soup in October 2022.
*25:18.920- 25:23.260* :  While no harm was done to the painting due to its glass cover, the antique Italian
*25:23.260- 25:24.780* :  frame was damaged.
*25:25.320- 25:29.240* :  Plummer told the court she made her choices and that she was happy with them.
*25:29.660- 25:32.600* :  The Jarge described their actions as idiotic.
*25:33.240- 25:34.360* :  Divya Talwar
*25:35.120- 25:40.280* :  3D printers have been used to create all kinds of things, toys, furniture, even cars.
*25:40.940- 25:43.720* :  But our next story is about a device that works on a bigger scale.
*25:43.820- 25:48.720* :  It's set to build the world's first 3D printed hotel.
*25:49.420- 25:50.700* :  Stephanie Zacherson has the details.
*25:53.440- 25:59.080* :  In the sandy desert of western taxes on the outskirts of the small city of Marfa, a
*25:59.080- 26:01.460* :  new set of building is taking shape.
*26:03.100- 26:08.940* :  The carved walls, browning as they dry in the heat, are being piped out by a robotic arm
*26:08.940- 26:13.180* :  that's attached to the almost 5-meter tall 3D printer.
*26:13.980- 26:19.420* :  As its layering thick lines of the cement-based mixture to create the walls, it doesn't
*26:19.420- 26:22.500* :  look too different from piping icing on a cake.
*26:23.160- 26:28.440* :  Jason Ballard, the founder of the printing company Icon, wears dark glasses and a wide-brimmed
*26:28.440- 26:33.180* :  hat to protect him from the scorching sun as he walks into one of the future bedrooms,
*26:33.180- 26:36.900* :  a circular room, and explains the idea behind the project.
*26:37.500- 26:41.680* :  You know, the base mixture, it's a little bit secret, so I won't give you all the formulas
*26:41.680- 26:46.620* :  I have to speak, but we've restricted ourselves to a list of sort of globally and ubiquitously
*26:46.620- 26:51.020* :  available materials so that we can do this all over the world and do it affordably all
*26:51.020- 26:53.520* :  over the world, so no exotic materials, no super expensive materials.
*26:53.580- 26:59.540* :  The plan here in the Texan desert is to expand El Cosmico, a remote, artistic campground
*26:59.540- 27:06.180* :  of vintage trailers, yurts and tents, with the addition of 43 hotel huts and 18 residential
*27:06.180- 27:06.740* :  homes.
*27:07.340- 27:13.340* :  Its owner, Liz Lumber, says the new technology allows for unbridled creativity when constructing
*27:13.400- 27:13.720* :  them.
*27:14.300- 27:21.900* :  You've never been able to build with such a little constraint and such fluidity, just
*27:21.900- 27:27.960* :  the curves and the domes and the parabolas, it's a crazy way to build.
*27:28.480- 27:33.600* :  Milad Basley is a science and technology lecturer at Charles Darwin University in Australia.
*27:34.100- 27:39.720* :  He says the efficiency of 3D printing on an industrial scale provides a lot of possibilities,
*27:40.500- 27:46.200* :  but points out there would be other consequences when swapping construction workers for a printer.
*27:46.340- 27:52.680* :  We just cut so many of those jobs from the social point of view and the effect in the economy
*27:53.320- 27:57.180* :  in terms of the local jobs, especially in the remote area, for the Cuban wildlife
*27:57.180- 28:02.040* :  tools that we've been able to consider when we're going to 3D printing.
*28:02.480- 28:06.960* :  There are already projects for building 3D printed housing in countries like Germany,
*28:06.960- 28:13.640* :  Ireland and Portugal, and slightly further away, NASA's been looking at 3D printing for
*28:13.640- 28:16.260* :  building human settlements on the moon.
*28:16.740- 28:17.700* :  Stephanie Zacherson
*28:18.520- 28:23.240* :  The film The Elephant Man tells the true story of John Merrick, a heavily deformed man
*28:23.240- 28:25.160* :  who was mistreated because of his appearance.
*28:25.720- 28:30.960* :  That was in Victorian England, but spool forward more than 100 years and are things any different
*28:30.960- 28:31.420* :  today.
*28:31.580- 28:36.740* :  Well, the experience of Oliver Bromley would suggest that some attitudes remain the same.
*28:36.740- 28:41.480* :  He has a genetic condition that causes non-cancerous tumors to grow on his nerves.
*28:42.100- 28:44.300* :  The effect is very visible on his face.
*28:44.920- 28:49.240* :  He told Anita an aunt about one occasion when a restaurant asked him to leave because
*28:49.240- 28:51.280* :  of complaints he was scaring customers.
*28:51.900- 28:55.740* :  I've never really been as directly discriminated against as I was on that occasion.
*28:55.940- 28:59.080* :  I went into the local park and I actually bored my eyes out.
*28:59.220- 29:03.420* :  I called my wife who came to my rescue, she consoled me and we worked on a plan of action
*29:03.420- 29:08.440* :  going forward and I had such huge support from the hospital staff with whom I shared
*29:08.440- 29:12.980* :  the story as well as my wider family so I felt very reassured after that.
*29:13.160- 29:13.980* :  Did they have a apologise?
*29:13.980- 29:19.460* :  I used their website contact details firstly to complain and then to ask for some sort
*29:19.460- 29:21.960* :  of justification for why they acted in that manner.
*29:21.960- 29:27.500* :  They didn't reply so I took it to the police who were very hopeful they came and interviewed
