*02:12.320- 02:13.920* :  People could come through the same backgrounds.
*02:13.920- 02:15.540* :  They had the same type of education.
*02:16.180- 02:17.480* :  Then they can be vulnerable to group think,
*02:17.480- 02:19.860* :  which is a really common route to intelligence failure.
*02:20.520- 02:23.840* :  Now in the UK, the security service MI5 has made

*02:55.880- 02:56.880* :  in Pennsylvania.
*02:57.780- 02:59.060* :  Speaking at a press conference,
*02:59.060- 03:02.460* :  Sheriff Rick Bradshaw gave details of the evidence
*03:02.460- 03:04.000* :  that had been found at the scene.
*03:04.660- 03:09.660* :  In the bushes where this guy was is an AK-47 style rifle
*03:09.660- 03:12.680* :  with a scope, two backpacks which were hung on the fence
*03:12.680- 03:15.500* :  that had ceramic tile in them and a GoPro,
*03:15.500- 03:17.440* :  which he was going to take pictures of.
*03:17.820- 03:19.460* :  Those are being processed right now.
*03:19.780- 03:22.580* :  The secret service agent that was on the course
*03:22.580- 03:23.900* :  did a fantastic job.
*03:23.900- 03:28.320* :  What they do is they have an agent that jumps one hole ahead
*03:28.320- 03:29.600* :  of her to present was after.
*03:29.960- 03:32.420* :  And he was able to spot this rifle barrel sticking out
*03:32.420- 03:35.120* :  of the fence and immediately engage that individual
*03:35.700- 03:37.380* :  at which time the individual took off.
*03:38.080- 03:42.080* :  Stunning beside the sheriff was a US secret service spokesman
*03:42.080- 03:45.020* :  who described more about what his agent did
*03:45.420- 03:47.760* :  while on the golf course guarding Donald Trump.
*03:48.360- 03:51.600* :  He noticed that the rifle was pointed out,
*03:51.840- 03:52.940* :  our agents engaged.
*03:53.380- 03:56.700* :  We're not sure right now if the individual was able
*03:56.700- 03:58.140* :  to take a shot at our agents,
*03:58.800- 04:03.200* :  but for sure our agents were able to engage with the soldier.
*04:03.200- 04:04.880* :  The first way was to present it.
*04:05.720- 04:08.380* :  I probably was Donald Trump when this gentleman
*04:08.380- 04:09.720* :  was caught and stopped.
*04:10.300- 04:12.600* :  Probably between three and 500 yards,
*04:13.120- 04:14.880* :  but with a rifle on a scope like that,
*04:14.880- 04:16.900* :  it's not a long distance.
*04:17.780- 04:21.800* :  The CBS News Correspondent Christian Benevidis is in Florida
*04:22.340- 04:25.720* :  and says the FBI and our taking the lead in the investigation.
*04:26.260- 04:28.620* :  But this point, what we know is that the secret service
*04:28.760- 04:31.340* :  had already amped up the security
*04:31.340- 04:34.620* :  around the former president because of what we saw happen
*04:34.620- 04:36.700* :  in Butler, Pennsylvania about two months ago.
*04:36.700- 04:40.380* :  At this point, the investigation is just getting underway.
*04:40.960- 04:43.180* :  What we know is that a secret service agent
*04:43.180- 04:45.660* :  apparently spotted the alleged gunman
*04:45.660- 04:48.760* :  as he was two holes ahead of the former president
*04:49.140- 04:52.500* :  who was golfing after he spotted the gunman,
*04:52.500- 04:56.340* :  apparently the secret service agent engaged.
*04:56.340- 05:02.340* :  And at that point, the suspect jumps out from the bushes
*05:02.420- 05:03.980* :  and into the street.
*05:04.300- 05:06.020* :  At this point, according to officials,
*05:06.020- 05:09.540* :  is when a witness sees somebody running from the bushes
*05:09.540- 05:12.620* :  and getting into a vehicle, a black Nissan.
*05:12.620- 05:16.600* :  That Nissan then starts traveling towards the highway.
*05:17.160- 05:21.920* :  At some point, this individual that spotted the suspect
*05:21.920- 05:23.040* :  jumping off from the bushes,
*05:23.480- 05:27.260* :  takes a picture of the license plate of this vehicle.
*05:27.820- 05:30.520* :  That individual then comes forward to police.
*05:30.540- 05:34.400* :  Eventually, police are able to apprehend someone
*05:34.400- 05:37.720* :  in that vehicle just north of here in Martin County
*05:37.720- 05:39.300* :  about one jurisdiction away.
*05:39.860- 05:43.280* :  At this point, again, investigation is very early on
*05:43.700- 05:46.400* :  and there's no sense on who this person is.
*05:46.700- 05:48.740* :  The identity has not been released
*05:48.740- 05:51.540* :  and the motive has not been released, but the FBI,
*05:51.540- 05:54.360* :  the suspect that this is a second attempt
*05:54.360- 05:56.240* :  on the life of the former president.
*05:57.000- 05:59.680* :  CBS News correspondent Christian Benevedes.
*06:00.480- 06:03.240* :  Storm Boris is continuing to hammer much of central
*06:03.240- 06:06.180* :  and eastern Europe with exceptionally heavy rain,
*06:06.180- 06:08.220* :  gale force winds and flooding.
*06:08.720- 06:10.100* :  The impact has been lethal.
*06:10.140- 06:12.820* :  In Romania, at least five people have died
*06:12.820- 06:16.220* :  and one person has been killed in both Austria and Poland.
*06:16.940- 06:18.500* :  Schools of homes across the region
*06:18.500- 06:20.940* :  have been flooded or swept away entirely,
*06:20.940- 06:24.440* :  causing mass evacuations, more than 10,000
*06:24.440- 06:25.760* :  in the Czech Republic alone.
*06:26.620- 06:30.220* :  These residents in the Romanian village of Slobosia, Konaki,
*06:30.220- 06:33.300* :  described how flooding there has left them with nothing.
*06:35.680- 06:37.160* :  It destroyed everything.
*06:37.580- 06:39.140* :  I don't have anything left.
*06:39.860- 06:41.160* :  The beds are filled with mud.
*06:41.160- 06:42.760* :  The pillows are filled.
*06:43.180- 06:44.520* :  I have nowhere to sleep.
*06:46.900- 06:49.020* :  We don't have food, water, clothes.
*06:49.560- 06:50.680* :  The neighbor gave me a dress.
*06:52.260- 06:53.840* :  It killed the docks, the beaks.
*06:53.840- 06:56.380* :  It killed all the chickens, all the grains.
*06:56.920- 06:58.040* :  We have nothing left.
*06:58.720- 07:00.800* :  Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk says
*07:00.800- 07:02.800* :  he's going to declare a state of disaster.
*07:03.620- 07:05.520* :  I spoke to our eastern Europe correspondent,
*07:05.520- 07:07.520* :  Sarah Reinsford, on Sunday evening,
*07:07.520- 07:11.520* :  who was in the flood struck Polish city of Nisa near the Czech border.
*07:11.960- 07:13.560* :  She described the conditions there.
*07:14.060- 07:15.620* :  We turned a corner here in Nisa,
*07:15.840- 07:18.000* :  and we were expecting to turn down a road,
*07:18.140- 07:22.220* :  but it is a huge and very fast-moving river now.
*07:22.700- 07:24.400* :  It has been completely flooded.
*07:24.400- 07:27.500* :  The water is extremely dangerous looking, frankly.
*07:27.500- 07:29.860* :  And in front of me, there is a fire engine
*07:29.860- 07:32.760* :  and a military truck that is stuck right in the middle of it.
*07:32.760- 07:34.300* :  There are people perched on the top
*07:34.420- 07:36.320* :  and just in the last 10 minutes or so,
*07:36.800- 07:38.360* :  a military vehicle has rolled,
*07:38.360- 07:42.420* :  trundled down the road towards this raging flood water,
*07:42.700- 07:45.000* :  and they're about to try to rescue the firefighters
*07:45.000- 07:48.280* :  and the soldiers, in fact, who were trapped in the water.
*07:48.280- 07:51.100* :  And that's just, I think, one illustration of how serious
*07:51.540- 07:53.520* :  the situation here is, not just in Poland,
*07:53.520- 07:55.780* :  but right across this region,
*07:55.780- 07:58.320* :  as that flood water rushes down the mountains.
*07:58.620- 07:59.500* :  The rain has stopped.
*07:59.500- 08:00.900* :  It hasn't been raining here all day.
*08:01.280- 08:02.660* :  In fact, the skies are pretty clear,
*08:02.660- 08:04.480* :  but there is more that's forecast to come.
*08:04.880- 08:07.380* :  But the problem, even without any more rain,
*08:07.380- 08:09.660* :  is that there is a lot more water coming down the mountains.
*08:10.300- 08:11.220* :  Dams are bursting.
*08:11.220- 08:13.380* :  Rivers are bursting in their banks,
*08:13.420- 08:15.800* :  and reservoirs are overflowing.
*08:15.860- 08:17.620* :  And that's precisely what's happened here in Nisa,
*08:17.620- 08:19.500* :  where the situation is extremely serious
*08:19.720- 08:21.660* :  right in the centre of the town.
*08:22.020- 08:24.260* :  With devastating effects across the wide area,
*08:25.060- 08:28.280* :  which regions or areas are seeing the worst impact of the flooding?
*08:28.600- 08:30.500* :  It's the whole of this border region, really,
*08:30.620- 08:32.180* :  between the Czech Republic and Poland,
*08:32.240- 08:34.700* :  and, of course, this is a region that, in 1997,
*08:34.700- 08:36.920* :  experienced the worst-ever flood,
*08:36.920- 08:39.120* :  historic floods that people here still remember.
*08:39.240- 08:41.020* :  And they're kind of shocked, I think,
*08:41.020- 08:43.300* :  to see it all happening again in front of their eyes.
*08:43.500- 08:46.000* :  Just in Nisa, where I am, in the town centre,
*08:46.240- 08:47.960* :  I've seen people rolling up their trousers
*08:47.960- 08:50.280* :  and trying to wade through fast-moving water
*08:50.280- 08:52.060* :  to get to their homes.
*08:52.060- 08:53.880* :  The town hospital has been flooded.
*08:53.880- 08:56.940* :  They've been evacuating people from emergency care.
*08:57.460- 08:58.340* :  The military is involved.
*08:58.340- 08:59.420* :  The peace are involved.
*08:59.940- 09:01.420* :  Donald Trump's Prime Minister has said he's
*09:01.420- 09:03.720* :  done to declare a state of natural emergency,
*09:03.760- 09:07.100* :  and it is definitely what is playing out here in front of us.
*09:07.220- 09:09.420* :  In Nisa, and, as I say, right across this region,
*09:09.420- 09:12.820* :  because the danger is anywhere where the river water
*09:12.820- 09:14.940* :  and the rainwater can come gushing through
*09:15.140- 09:18.420* :  and flood what is already rivers and reservoirs
*09:18.420- 09:19.380* :  that are under great strain.
*09:19.960- 09:21.280* :  Sarah Rainesford in Poland.
*09:22.480- 09:23.820* :  My colleague, Julian Marshall,
*09:23.820- 09:26.700* :  spoke to Professor Miroslav Tinka in Bruno
*09:26.700- 09:28.680* :  in the southwest of the Czech Republic.
*09:29.300- 09:31.720* :  He's with the Global Change Research Institute
*09:31.720- 09:33.480* :  of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
*09:34.280- 09:36.540* :  So what's his meteorological explanation
*09:36.540- 09:38.340* :  for these heavy rains and flooding?
*09:38.940- 09:42.160* :  We basically heard a slowly moving called front
*09:42.920- 09:46.320* :  that turn around if I put it in very simple turns
*09:46.320- 09:48.180* :  and went back over the same area
*09:48.680- 09:52.100* :  and basically brought an usual amount of precipitation
*09:52.100- 09:54.340* :  over the same, a relatively small region.
*09:54.720- 09:58.240* :  And that's usually what causes floods.
*09:58.240- 10:02.320* :  In this case, because we get it at multiple catchments
*10:02.320- 10:06.800* :  and river basins, we are facing both a local flooding,
*10:06.800- 10:10.220* :  but also we are expecting to have floods downstream
*10:10.220- 10:15.640* :  as these smaller sort of rivers joined together at the lowlands.
*10:16.040- 10:18.800* :  That's about the rain doesn't have to be so heavy,
*10:18.880- 10:21.140* :  but because the sheer amount of water that is coming
*10:21.140- 10:24.480* :  from the catchment, that's what's causing the flooding downstream.
*10:24.480- 10:27.580* :  So it's a combination of sort of intense rain
*10:28.000- 10:30.440* :  in many cases over the large areas.
*10:30.440- 10:34.480* :  So when the river meets the major sort of river,
*10:34.480- 10:37.500* :  then we have an usually high levels.
*10:38.100- 10:40.280* :  And have you been affected where you are?
*10:40.700- 10:43.020* :  In Bruno itself, we have flooding,
*10:43.020- 10:46.360* :  especially south of Bruno, two rivers.
*10:47.100- 10:50.840* :  One of the rivers is relatively well managed with two dams.
*10:50.860- 10:54.180* :  So they were able to slow down the peak of the flood wave.
*10:54.180- 10:57.560* :  The other river doesn't have a major dam system.
*10:57.560- 10:59.700* :  So it's pretty much not a free flowing,
*10:59.700- 11:02.960* :  but it's relatively more difficult to regulate.
*11:02.960- 11:06.160* :  So where these rivers meet then and below,
*11:06.160- 11:09.640* :  there is a major problem with local evacuations needed.
*11:10.500- 11:13.420* :  You used the word unusual earlier on.
*11:14.620- 11:18.580* :  So you're saying this is unusual because of what?
*11:19.320- 11:22.140* :  Well, it's unusual from probably several perspectives.
*11:22.140- 11:26.700* :  One unusual thing is that yes, we get floods time to time,
*11:27.020- 11:29.960* :  but in many areas, these are worse than ones
*11:29.960- 11:31.980* :  in the 100 year flood events.
*11:32.400- 11:36.840* :  And we had a similar events in 1997, 2002 and now.
*11:36.980- 11:39.900* :  And we didn't have it over the most of 20th century.
*11:40.180- 11:42.880* :  So the flooding is sort of looks like returning
*11:42.880- 11:46.540* :  to century Europe and it's probably at the peak
*11:46.540- 11:48.760* :  compared to the last 500 years.
*11:49.020- 11:52.740* :  Looking at a long-term data with a large Eastern European area,
*11:52.740- 11:53.820* :  not only to check here.
*11:53.920- 11:56.780* :  The second unusual thing is that it's coming
*11:56.780- 11:58.440* :  relatively late in the season.
*11:58.920- 12:03.000* :  Primatologically, we have the most rain in the summer months,
*12:03.480- 12:05.700* :  June, July, August, September.
*12:05.820- 12:10.400* :  It's on average much sort of poor in the rainfall,
*12:11.060- 12:12.900* :  but as the season is getting longer,
*12:12.900- 12:15.160* :  we face the longer temperatures
*12:15.160- 12:17.420* :  than we get the more rain later.
*12:17.420- 12:19.740* :  But it's unusual in terms of the historical records.
*12:20.500- 12:22.160* :  Professor Miroslav Tinker
*12:22.160- 12:24.680* :  from the Global Change Research Institute.
*12:26.160- 12:28.340* :  The Israeli military has rejected claims
*12:28.340- 12:31.140* :  by the Houthis in Yemen that a missile they fired
*12:31.140- 12:33.380* :  towards Central Israel early on Sunday
*12:33.380- 12:34.920* :  was a hypersonic weapon.
*12:35.660- 12:38.520* :  The ballistic missile landed in an uninhabited area
*12:38.520- 12:41.800* :  after Israeli air defense systems failed to destroy it.
*12:42.440- 12:44.360* :  Israeli military officials said it was not
*12:44.360- 12:47.160* :  an especially new or advanced kind of weapon.
*12:47.700- 12:50.380* :  The military said it fired multiple interceptors
*12:50.480- 12:52.320* :  and at least one struck the missile,
*12:52.320- 12:54.420* :  but failed to destroy it completely.
*12:55.140- 12:58.200* :  At a meeting on Sunday of Israel's Cabinet in Jerusalem,
*12:58.220- 13:00.980* :  the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
*13:01.040- 13:03.300* :  Houthis in Yemen would pay a heavy price
*13:03.300- 13:04.600* :  for launching the attack.
*13:07.940- 13:10.800* :  We're in a multi-front battle against Iran's axis
*13:10.800- 13:13.020* :  of evil that strives to destroy us.
*13:13.360- 13:16.000* :  This morning, the Houthis launched a surface to air missile
*13:16.000- 13:17.680* :  from Yemen into our territory.
*13:18.300- 13:19.780* :  They should have known by now that we
*13:19.780- 13:22.680* :  exact a heavy price for any attempt to harm us.
*13:23.100- 13:24.840* :  Those who need a reminder on the matter
*13:25.180- 13:27.340* :  are invited to visit the port of Hodeida.
*13:28.040- 13:31.140* :  I heard more from our Middle East correspondent, Paul Adams,
*13:31.140- 13:33.260* :  who's been following developments from Jerusalem.
*13:33.920- 13:37.680* :  This was a ballistic missile fired from Yemen,
*13:38.000- 13:39.460* :  a very, very long way away,
*13:39.460- 13:42.780* :  which seems to have reached much further into Israel
*13:43.280- 13:45.760* :  than any previous Houthi missiles.
*13:46.240- 13:47.980* :  It landed in the center of the country.
*13:47.980- 13:51.620* :  The previous ballistic missiles fired in this direction
*13:51.620- 13:55.020* :  had all basically reached the very southern tip of Israel.
*13:55.500- 13:57.380* :  Of course, there was that drone incident
*13:57.400- 14:01.280* :  a month or so back in which a Houthi drone landed right
*14:01.280- 14:04.860* :  in the center of Tel Aviv and killed one civilian.
*14:05.260- 14:08.780* :  And interestingly, it was not properly intercepted
*14:08.780- 14:11.280* :  by Israel's air defense system.
*14:11.640- 14:13.960* :  We've learned this evening from a military official
*14:14.380- 14:17.260* :  that the missile was hit but not fully destroyed.
*14:17.880- 14:20.660* :  And the very slight damage that was done on the ground
*14:20.660- 14:25.980* :  was we believe, done by fragments of the Israeli interceptor
*14:25.980- 14:26.440* :  missiles.
*14:26.820- 14:28.940* :  So I think this will cause concern in Israel
*14:28.940- 14:32.060* :  because it is a step up in the kind of capability
*14:32.720- 14:35.180* :  that the Houthis seem to have at their disposal.
*14:35.180- 14:37.460* :  And in fact, a Houthi spokesman called this
*14:37.840- 14:40.220* :  a new hypersonic missile.
*14:40.480- 14:43.780* :  Benjamin Netanyahu has warned of retaliation.
*14:44.920- 14:45.900* :  What's likely to happen?
*14:46.060- 14:48.760* :  After that drone attack on Tel Aviv,
*14:49.200- 14:52.740* :  the Israelis mounted a very, very sizable air raid
*14:53.140- 14:57.160* :  on the Yemeni port of Haddadah, destroying port facilities
*14:57.480- 14:59.240* :  and a huge oil storage depot.
*14:59.240- 15:01.100* :  It was designed, I think, to send a very, very
*15:01.420- 15:04.780* :  emphatic message to the Houthis not to try this again.
*15:05.300- 15:06.880* :  Well, they have tried it again.
*15:07.320- 15:08.540* :  They seem undeterred.
*15:08.940- 15:13.140* :  In this case, no Israeli civilians were injured or killed.
*15:13.720- 15:17.400* :  But I think the fact that this new capability has been
*15:17.400- 15:21.520* :  demonstrated means that Israel does feel the need to do
*15:21.520- 15:22.480* :  something about it.
*15:22.520- 15:25.380* :  And indeed, Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would
*15:25.620- 15:27.100* :  extract a heavy price.
*15:27.100- 15:31.420* :  And he reminded anyone paying attention of the raid
*15:31.420- 15:32.260* :  on Haddadah.
*15:32.540- 15:36.260* :  So I think it is not, it wouldn't be surprising if in the
*15:36.260- 15:40.380* :  coming days or week or so, we see something again,
*15:40.380- 15:42.640* :  something dramatic, mounted by the Israelis.
*15:43.220- 15:45.360* :  Have the Houthis said anything else about the attack?
*15:45.960- 15:50.100* :  Yes, they said that it was the start of a series of attacks
*15:50.100- 15:53.920* :  leading up to the anniversary of October the 7th.
*15:53.920- 15:57.060* :  Of course, that's the date at which Hamas fighters
*15:57.700- 16:02.240* :  raided into Israel, killed in brutal fashion, 1200 people,
*16:02.900- 16:05.600* :  and triggered the war in Gaza that continues to this day.
*16:06.140- 16:08.780* :  And so the Houthis, who have said that all of their actions,
*16:08.780- 16:12.480* :  both attacks on Israel and attacks on shipping in the Red Sea,
*16:12.480- 16:15.940* :  have all been in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza,
*16:16.360- 16:17.920* :  they are saying we are going to do more of this
*16:17.940- 16:19.360* :  in the run up to that anniversary.
*16:20.100- 16:21.340* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem.
*16:22.060- 16:25.120* :  The Polaris Dawn mission, whose crew traveled further
*16:25.120- 16:27.580* :  into space than any humans for half a century,
*16:27.900- 16:29.460* :  has come to a successful end.
*16:29.960- 16:33.140* :  The SpaceX dragon capsule safely splash down
*16:33.140- 16:34.480* :  off the coast of Florida.
*16:35.040- 16:35.960* :  Palabghat reports.
*16:37.460- 16:39.980* :  Welcome back to Planet Earth, Polaris Dawn.
*16:40.700- 16:45.120* :  Reentry and splash down for Jarod Isaacman's mission went smoothly.
*16:45.780- 16:48.320* :  The dragon capsule re-entered the Earth's atmosphere.
*16:48.780- 16:52.620* :  Its parachutes opened, and the vessel, with its full person crew,
*16:53.040- 16:56.360* :  then drifted down to splash down off the coast of Florida.
*16:57.160- 16:59.600* :  SpaceX has done this many times before,
*17:00.160- 17:03.080* :  but there was nothing routine about the Polaris Dawn mission.
*17:03.680- 17:07.240* :  The crew went higher than any other since the Apollo astronauts
*17:07.240- 17:09.560* :  of the 1960s and 70s.
*17:10.120- 17:11.960* :  They went through a radiation belt
*17:12.360- 17:15.220* :  and carried out the first private sector spacewalk.
*17:16.140- 17:16.940* :  Palabghos.
*17:19.940- 17:23.640* :  Still to come, the Lebanese writer and fervent advocate
*17:23.640- 17:27.480* :  of the Palestinian cause, Elias Hori, has died.
*17:27.900- 17:31.480* :  To him, the Palestinian tragedy was not just about the Palestinians.
*17:32.200- 17:35.100* :  It was a universal, humanist question
*17:35.100- 17:36.740* :  that affects all human beings.
*17:45.640- 17:48.680* :  Explaining football to the friend who's just there for the nachos?
*17:49.220- 17:49.480* :  Hard.
*17:50.180- 17:53.860* :  Tailgating from home like a pro with snacks and drinks everyone will love,

*18:51.200- 18:55.940* :  French authorities have described the death of eight migrants in the channel as a new tragedy
*18:55.940- 18:59.520* :  and said smugglers were putting people at greater and greater risk.
*19:00.140- 19:04.800* :  A boat which was carrying about 60 migrants from countries including Eritrea, Sudan and
*19:04.800- 19:07.640* :  Syria came apart of the coast near Balloyne.
*19:08.180- 19:10.980* :  Six survivors, including a baby, were taken to hospital.
*19:11.560- 19:12.600* :  Simon Jones reports.
*19:13.420- 19:18.360* :  On the beach in the village of Umbla Turs, a crumple, deflated dinghy tells the story of
*19:18.360- 19:20.180* :  the latest loss of life in the channel.
*19:20.540- 19:24.880* :  There is a child's rubber ring, used as a makeshift life jacket, a canister of petrol
*19:24.880- 19:26.960* :  and a shoe discarded in the sand.
*19:27.460- 19:30.660* :  Scores of people packed onto the boat in the early hours of this morning.
*19:30.660- 19:35.540* :  The dead are believed to be from Eritrea, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt and Iran.
*19:35.660- 19:38.980* :  A 10-month-old baby was taken to hospital with hypothermia.
*19:39.460- 19:42.060* :  Jacques-Billon is a senior official in the Calais region.
*19:42.540- 19:43.380* :  The bilan is terrible.
*19:44.120- 19:46.280* :  The figures are terrible.
*19:46.720- 19:47.740* :  Eight people have died.
*19:48.540- 19:53.180* :  The boat sets sail from the slack area, close to Vimera, with 59 people on board.
*19:54.040- 19:55.060* :  It quickly got into trouble.
*19:55.380- 19:56.660* :  It ran a ground on the shore.
*19:57.800- 20:00.180* :  The boat evidently tore apart on the rocks.
*20:03.300- 20:06.900* :  At least 45 migrants have died so far this year attempting the crossing.
*20:06.900- 20:09.780* :  That's more than four times the number for the whole of last year.
*20:10.180- 20:11.220* :  Many of the migrants drowned.
*20:11.220- 20:14.020* :  Others were crushed in dangerously overloaded boats.
*20:14.640- 20:18.380* :  But despite the risks, the desire to get to the UK remains undiminished.
*20:18.700- 20:24.260* :  Yesterday, more than 800 people on 14 boats were brought to Dover by the Border Force and the RNLI.
*20:24.740- 20:28.540* :  The French authorities, like the British, say the gangs organising the journeys,
*20:28.820- 20:29.680* :  need to be stopped.
*20:29.680- 20:32.140* :  But both admit this will not be an easy task.
*20:32.760- 20:33.420* :  Simon Jones.
*20:34.760- 20:41.100* :  The Nigerian authorities say more than 270 inmates are now known to be missing after escaping
*20:41.100- 20:44.500* :  from custody when severe flooding damage to prison.
*20:45.040- 20:48.800* :  The flooding was caused by the collapse of a dam following heavy rainfall.
*20:49.640- 20:52.280* :  Our Africa Regional Editor, Will Ross reports.
*20:52.780- 20:56.580* :  This is the first time that the Nigerian authorities have admitted the scale of the prison
*20:56.600- 20:56.940* :  break.
*20:57.320- 21:01.720* :  The governor of Borno State, Baba Ghanazuluam, had earlier told the BBC that some members
*21:01.720- 21:05.580* :  of the Islamist militant group Boko Aram were amongst those who'd got out.
*21:05.960- 21:10.620* :  What we don't know is how many of the more than 270 missing prisoners are linked to
*21:10.620- 21:11.420* :  Jihadist violence.
*21:12.040- 21:16.620* :  The government department that runs Nigeria's prisons says it's working with security agencies
*21:16.620- 21:18.200* :  to recapture the fugitives.
*21:18.880- 21:22.060* :  It's published their photos and has urged people to remain calm.
*21:22.580- 21:26.300* :  Even adding that the prison break does not affect public safety.
*21:26.820- 21:27.480* :  Will Ross.
*21:28.620- 21:34.500* :  Not rare in the world of ballet took place on stage in Australia in recent days.
*21:35.080- 21:36.660* :  A male paddeder.
*21:37.540- 21:42.840* :  Now as the jury filed back into court, Oscar leaned over the dock eagerly scanning the
*21:42.840- 21:48.580* :  faces of the 12 good men and true, seemingly trying to read in their physiognomies his fate.
*21:49.520- 21:50.300* :  No one spoke.
*21:51.160- 21:52.940* :  No one hardly dared to breathe.
*21:53.380- 21:58.320* :  The sentence of the court is there to be imprisoned and kept to hard labor for two
*21:58.320- 21:58.860* :  years.
*22:01.860- 22:08.460* :  Oscar is a classical ballet featuring gay romance in the portrayal of the love life of the
*22:08.460- 22:11.940* :  famous 19th century Irish writer Oscar Wilde.
*22:12.460- 22:18.200* :  Oscar is the brainchild of David Hallberg, artistic director of the Australian Ballet and
*22:18.200- 22:21.780* :  the first American to have been made a principal of the Bolshoi Ballet.
*22:22.400- 22:27.860* :  The choreographer is Tony Award-winning Christopher Wielden, whose credits include MJ
*22:27.860- 22:30.680* :  The Musical, now running in London and New York.
*22:31.480- 22:36.080* :  David Hallberg took a break from his hectic schedule of rehearsals to tell my colleague
*22:36.080- 22:38.100* :  Paul Henley more about the concept.
*22:38.600- 22:42.480* :  The concept is basically the life and the writings of Oscar Wilde.
*22:42.780- 22:48.800* :  Christopher Wielden, the choreographer, has interconnected two of the great stories that
*22:48.800- 22:54.160* :  he wrote, The Nightingale and The Rose and the picture of Dorian Gray, as well as the
*22:54.160- 22:59.780* :  life that Oscar led, a very colorful life to say the least, but including his trial
*22:59.780- 23:01.440* :  and the time that he spent in prison.
*23:02.040- 23:05.880* :  So it's really the life and the writings of this literary genius.
*23:06.540- 23:08.920* :  Gay ballet isn't an unheard of genre.
*23:09.380- 23:11.820* :  Why do you say this is the first classical gay ballet?
*23:12.120- 23:17.120* :  It is because I think, you know, ballets have always been very heteronormative.
*23:17.120- 23:21.400* :  The prince falls in love with the princess, Romeo falls in love with Juliet.
*23:22.100- 23:26.400* :  I myself as a dancer, you know, for 20 plus years played those roles.
*23:27.260- 23:32.260* :  And the ballet world never really veered into another direction until now.
*23:32.920- 23:40.780* :  And I think, you know, as we start to diversify and include other people that have other walks
*23:40.820- 23:45.140* :  of life, queer people, in this instance, I think it's really important to tell stories
*23:45.140- 23:48.500* :  like that, but ballet does not have a history of doing that.
*23:48.720- 23:54.400* :  Actually quite surprising when you think that so many gay lead dancers have never played
*23:54.400- 23:55.160* :  a gay role.
*23:55.700- 23:56.040* :  It is.
*23:56.340- 23:58.020* :  I was never afforded that opportunity.
*23:58.240- 23:59.380* :  I am a gay man.
*23:59.600- 24:06.740* :  And I honestly can't imagine what it would have been like to be able to express the way
*24:06.740- 24:10.060* :  I express love and my personal life on the stage.
*24:10.380- 24:15.900* :  I was never afforded the opportunity, but the dances of the Australian ballet are being
*24:15.900- 24:17.600* :  afforded this opportunity now.
*24:17.840- 24:22.000* :  You'd definitely never have been afforded that opportunity at the Balshoi in Moscow,
*24:22.000- 24:22.540* :  would you?
*24:22.940- 24:24.620* :  No, no, not at all.
*24:24.620- 24:29.940* :  I had some, you know, some great moments at Balshoi Theatre dancing the great classics,
*24:29.940- 24:33.320* :  but I was never given an opportunity like this.
*24:34.060- 24:37.540* :  David Hallberg, artistic director of the Australian Ballet.
*24:38.240- 24:45.200* :  The Lebanese writer and political activist, Elias Hori, has died in Beirut aged 76, born
*24:45.200- 24:47.700* :  to a middle-class Christian family in Beirut.
*24:47.700- 24:53.740* :  He joined the armed wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization as a young man, and fought
*24:53.740- 24:55.280* :  in the Lebanese Civil War.
*24:55.820- 25:01.600* :  He went on to write over a dozen novels in Arabic, including Gate of the Sun, which has
*25:01.600- 25:06.200* :  been described as the first true magnum opus of the Palestinian saga.
*25:07.180- 25:11.740* :  Fawar's Gehrgez, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics,
*25:12.320- 25:13.540* :  told us more about him.
*25:13.980- 25:21.380* :  Elias Hori was one of the leading and the most impactful writer and novelist, a thinker
*25:21.940- 25:23.460* :  and a public intellectual.
*25:24.080- 25:25.620* :  He was also an activist.
*25:25.800- 25:32.260* :  He participated in the Lebanese Civil War as a progressive leftist activist.
*25:33.200- 25:38.340* :  He fully supported the Arab Spring uprisings in 2010-2012.
*25:39.300- 25:45.940* :  The Palestinian tragedy was one of the most important questions that animated the writings
*25:46.620- 25:51.080* :  of Elias Hori, and of course, he's a position to Arab political authoritarianism.
*25:51.080- 25:55.460* :  I think to him, the Palestinian tragedy was not just about the Palestinians.
*25:55.860- 26:00.700* :  It was a universal humanist question that affects all human beings.
*26:01.540- 26:07.880* :  Most of these writings focus on questions of exile, on questions of basically fragmented
*26:08.520- 26:09.400* :  societies and identities.
*26:09.980- 26:14.980* :  Sadly, and tragically, Elias Hori was very indebted in the past few months.
*26:14.980- 26:21.260* :  I follow his writings in Al-Quds Al-Arabi, in newspaper published in London, and he basically
*26:21.260- 26:29.100* :  drew an organic link between what Israel was doing in Gaza and the deepening political
*26:29.100- 26:33.680* :  authoritarianism in Arab societies in the past 40 or 50 years.
*26:34.340- 26:37.620* :  Professor Fawar's Gehrgez, could you see yourself?
*26:37.620- 26:43.660* :  He's the next James Bond, a fictional spy character, but didn't get all A grades at school.
*26:44.400- 26:49.960* :  Well here in the UK, the security service MI5 has made its entry requirements a lot more
*26:49.960- 26:50.640* :  attainable.
*26:51.240- 26:52.540* :  Keri's Madement reports.
*26:56.880- 27:01.940* :  International travel, Gadgets galore, and Martini shaken, not stirred.
*27:02.440- 27:08.060* :  Working for MI5 may be the dream for many, but it's traditionally seen as open to few.
*27:08.760- 27:14.420* :  Until now, the days of needing a degree from a world-class university seem to be over.
*27:14.940- 27:21.440* :  In fact, there's now a position at MI5, which requires just one GCSE, exams that British
*27:21.440- 27:23.560* :  16-year-olds sit across the country.
*27:24.280- 27:27.140* :  As a foundation analyst, you'd be working with data.
*27:27.700- 27:32.980* :  From audiophiles to communications, your research will be used in investigations to keep
*27:32.980- 27:38.600* :  the country safe, and their reasoning for making entry requirements so accessible, according
*27:38.600- 27:39.420* :  to their website.
*27:40.200- 27:46.960* :  All our analysts have different backgrounds and come from different walks of life.
*27:47.460- 27:53.420* :  However, they do have one thing in common, a passion and interest in helping to protect
*27:53.420- 27:54.820* :  people and places.
*27:55.160- 27:59.640* :  You don't need experience in analysis or a degree to join us.
*27:59.840- 28:01.960* :  It's all about your potential.
*28:02.480- 28:07.660* :  Lewis Sage Passant is a researcher of intelligence and espionage at Loftbury University in the
*28:07.660- 28:11.260* :  UK, and an adjunct professor at Ciance Poe in Paris.
*28:12.140- 28:15.860* :  He says that this change in old ways offers plenty of positives.
*28:16.360- 28:21.420* :  I think traditionally there has been a leaning towards recruiting the best of the best.
*28:21.420- 28:25.400* :  This is a national security measure, so it's only natural that that has been the focus.
*28:26.100- 28:30.560* :  But I think there is often a risk, and I think that's what's probably prompted this type
*28:30.560- 28:35.520* :  of thinking, that if you have people who are always thinking in the same way, people
*28:35.520- 28:39.460* :  could come from the same backgrounds, they have the same type of education, then they can
*28:39.460- 28:42.820* :  be vulnerable to group think, which is a really common route to intelligence failure.
*28:43.220- 28:47.700* :  Hiring analysts with different qualifications, different backgrounds, even different levels
*28:47.700- 28:52.040* :  of qualifications, can actually be a plus for national security, because people can think
*28:52.040- 28:55.640* :  differently they can bring new perspectives in, and that's really important in intelligence
*28:55.640- 28:56.040* :  work.
*28:56.660- 29:01.080* :  If you successfully get through the six to nine month recruitment process, who knows
*29:01.080- 29:02.700* :  where your career could take you?
*29:03.280- 29:08.160* :  But remember, all you need now is a GCSE, one GCSE.
*29:15.720- 29:19.980* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
