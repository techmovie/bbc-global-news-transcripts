*00:16.080- 00:20.720* :  Hi everyone, my name is Natasha Rothwell and I'm here to tell you about my brand new show on Hulu
*00:20.720- 00:25.500* :  called How To Die Alone. I play the character of Melissa. She has no ambition, no love
*00:25.500- 00:31.940* :  life and no money, but what she does have is a reason to be the bad ass **** she was meant to be,
*00:31.940- 00:38.060* :  huh? I can't say ****. Okay, she has a reason to be the woman she was meant to be. You know what?
*00:38.060- 00:42.420* :  Just tell the bleep guy to stick around because I'm just getting **** started. Stream,
*00:42.420- 00:47.500* :  How To Die Alone starting Friday, September 13th on Hulu. Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently,
*00:47.500- 00:52.860* :  I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation.
*00:52.900- 00:57.000* :  They said yes. And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*00:57.000- 01:02.260* :  owners to your contracts, they said, what the **** are you talking about? You insane Hollywood ****.
*01:02.640- 01:07.980* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*01:45.420- 01:50.640* :  Also in this podcast, Barley's Governor proposes a two year ban on building new tourist
*01:50.640- 01:57.100* :  hotels. And with the Midwest front and center of the US presidential contest, what does it mean
*01:57.100- 02:01.560* :  to be a Midwesterner? When you say you're a Midwesterner, it really means something here in the
*02:01.660- 02:06.620* :  States, that genuine ethic. And you've been raised with it, you've been raised to work hard,
*02:06.620- 02:09.680* :  you're not giving anything. And I think that means a lot.
*02:14.000- 02:19.720* :  Germany says it's introducing strict new controls at all its land borders to combat
*02:19.720- 02:25.200* :  illegal migration and counter the threat of Islamist extremism. The country's interior
*02:25.200- 02:30.880* :  minister, Nancy Ferza, said the measures would come into force next week. She announced the move
*02:30.880- 02:38.440* :  at a news conference in Berlin. This will further limit irregular migration and protect against
*02:38.440- 02:43.880* :  the acute dangers posed by Islamist terror and serious crime. We are doing everything in order
*02:43.880- 02:48.960* :  to better protect the people of our country against this. That includes the far-reaching measures
*02:48.960- 02:55.080* :  I am taking now. To find out what lies behind the new approach, I've been talking to our
*02:55.080- 03:00.680* :  correspondent in Berlin, Damon Beginnes. Germany already has controls at many of its borders,
*03:00.680- 03:06.400* :  so particularly eastern and southern borders such as Poland, Czechia, Switzerland. And what
*03:06.460- 03:12.440* :  they've done so far is it's generally spot checks. So it's likely that is going to happen in
*03:12.440- 03:17.920* :  this case as well. Now it's all borders. It's not something that travelers or commuters will
*03:17.920- 03:23.680* :  necessarily notice. What they might notice is some cars are being flagged down or in trains,
*03:23.680- 03:27.560* :  they might see some board of guards talking to some passengers and asking to show their
*03:27.560- 03:31.220* :  documents in their passports. But apart from that it's probably not going to make a massive
*03:31.220- 03:35.820* :  impact on most people's lives. There is a political context to this, isn't it? The political
*03:35.820- 03:41.400* :  context is this ferocious debate about migration we've got going on right now. So the move comes
*03:41.400- 03:46.280* :  after a fatal stabbing in the town of Zorlingin in August. Three people died there. The suspect
*03:46.280- 03:53.140* :  is allegedly a Syrian asylum seeker who came to Germany whose application for asylum was rejected.
*03:53.200- 03:57.700* :  He was supposed to be deported. He wasn't. And this man is accused of being
*03:57.700- 04:02.680* :  his domestic extremist. So on the back of that this sparked off a huge debate about migration
*04:02.720- 04:08.880* :  and asylum seekers whose application have been rejected not being deported when they should be.
*04:09.180- 04:14.020* :  But it's also about the elections. We've had last week key regional elections in eastern
*04:14.020- 04:19.000* :  Germany where the far right A if deeded very well then in less than a week there's another key
*04:19.000- 04:23.920* :  election also in eastern Germany and Brandenburg where the far right is also suspected to do very
*04:23.920- 04:28.200* :  well. And the three governing coalition parties have done very badly. So they're in a mode of panic
*04:28.200- 04:32.680* :  now because all of a sudden all of mainstream parties in Germany with the exception of the Greens
*04:32.700- 04:38.580* :  but all the others are really trying to talk tough on migration because they think that's the
*04:38.580- 04:43.520* :  way to undermine the AFD. Critics would say that's not correct. You know you have a lot of NGO
*04:43.520- 04:48.220* :  groups, refugee rights groups, the churches now have come out today saying these measures are
*04:48.220- 04:55.040* :  dangerous and inhumane but certainly mainstream politics has suddenly shifted into this quite harsh
*04:55.040- 05:00.240* :  rhetoric about migrants and refugees. What's this going to mean for the unity of this three party
*05:00.240- 05:05.240* :  coalition in power at the moment? It's difficult to say because I think right now the mood and the
*05:05.240- 05:10.800* :  debate is sort of a fever pitch. So what you have right now in Germany you have quite a shrill
*05:10.800- 05:17.900* :  debate among centrist politicians who are suddenly talking very tough on migration to an extent that
*05:17.900- 05:22.380* :  we haven't really seen in Germany for a long time. I think also we're seeing a governing party,
*05:22.380- 05:26.620* :  the centre left, the social democrats, the chancellor, all of our shoulders party in a political
*05:26.660- 05:32.480* :  meltdown. So they're reacting also it seems to be a mode of panic and this is not going to help
*05:32.480- 05:36.400* :  the government because we've got three parties putting in three different directions on this.
*05:36.760- 05:40.320* :  You've got the liberals who are talking even tough from migration, they want even tougher
*05:40.660- 05:44.180* :  border checks and then you have the Greens that don't agree with any of this at all.
*05:44.480- 05:49.100* :  So one of the reasons why this government is not doing well with voters is because they've been
*05:49.100- 05:53.420* :  arguing a lot and pulling in three different directions and this issue is only going to increase
*05:53.420- 05:58.920* :  that feeling of disunity within the government. Dame Immiguinness in Berlin. The European Union needs
*05:58.920- 06:06.920* :  more than $800 billion of extra investment every year and major reform or it's at risk of decline.
*06:07.280- 06:12.800* :  That is the stark assessment spelled out in a report by Mario Draghi, the former head of the European
*06:12.800- 06:17.820* :  Central Bank. He's calling on the block to develop a more coordinated industrial policy
*06:17.820- 06:24.040* :  to stop the EU falling way behind the United States and China. Our Europe regional editat Danny
*06:24.040- 06:29.960* :  Aberhardt has more details. The EU, the Draghi report says, needs urgent and radical change
*06:29.960- 06:35.320* :  if it's to compete in an era in which it can no longer count on rapid growth in global trade.
*06:36.160- 06:41.780* :  Mario Draghi spelled out the magnitude of the situation. We have to understand we are becoming
*06:42.260- 06:47.680* :  ever smaller relative to the challenges we face. For the first time since the Cold War,
*06:48.280- 06:53.820* :  we must genuinely fear for our self-preservation and the reason for a unified response
*06:53.900- 06:59.340* :  and never being so compelling. Those challenges include a workforce projected to shrink,
*06:59.340- 07:04.320* :  high energy prices, increasing protectionism, restricting access to foreign markets,
*07:04.940- 07:10.040* :  difficulties securing supplies of key raw materials and a need for greater defense spending in
*07:10.040- 07:16.900* :  a less secure world. Productivity, the report argues, is key. It labeled it an existential challenge,
*07:16.900- 07:21.580* :  as unless it improves, the damage to Europe's economy will mean the block will have to
*07:21.580- 07:26.600* :  compromise some of its fundamental values, things such as equity and social inclusion.
*07:27.640- 07:33.280* :  Productivity in the EU, it says, is lagging behind the US, partly as the block is comparatively
*07:33.280- 07:38.980* :  weak in emerging technologies that will drive future growth. Only four of the world's top
*07:39.020- 07:45.460* :  50 tech companies, Mr. Draghi, said, were European. Unprecedented levels of annual investment are
*07:45.460- 07:52.100* :  needed, it says, nearly 5% of GDP across the block, several times that of the Marshall Plan that
*07:52.100- 07:57.520* :  followed the Second World War. The EU also needs to streamline decision-making and regulation.
*07:58.200- 08:02.980* :  That's easier said than done in a block of 27 countries, led by governments of a wide range
*08:02.980- 08:09.440* :  of political persuasions. The Draghi report says the Union must harness innovation, especially in
*08:09.440- 08:15.420* :  the tech sector, including artificial intelligence, building a better environment to allow startups to
*08:15.420- 08:20.800* :  expand and stay within Europe, rather than be tempted to relocate to the US, where there's ready
*08:20.800- 08:26.560* :  venture capital and less regulation. And it cited defence, both production and procurement,
*08:26.560- 08:32.380* :  as a sector that would benefit hugely from better coordination. It's currently badly fragmented.
*08:33.180- 08:38.860* :  The report also backs decarbonising the economy, one of the European Commission's central aims.
*08:39.380- 08:44.320* :  This, it says, is not just for the planet, but because it also offers a possible competitive
*08:44.320- 08:50.820* :  advantage. Danny Aberhard. Six months after she revealed that she had cancer. Catherine,
*08:50.820- 08:56.160* :  Princess of Wales, says she's finished her course of chemotherapy. She's released a video,
*08:56.420- 09:00.980* :  which was shot in the English County of Norfolk over the summer, where she was staying with
*09:00.980- 09:05.820* :  her husband, Prince William, the son of King Charles, and their children. Palace officials have
*09:05.820- 09:10.920* :  indicated that it isn't possible at this stage to say whether the princess is free from the disease,
*09:11.380- 09:16.880* :  but they say she will return to what they call a light schedule of public engagements in the coming
*09:16.880- 09:22.320* :  months. Our role correspondent, Danny Allarell, reports. The announcement from Kensington Palace
*09:22.320- 09:28.120* :  marks the end of this phase of the Princess of Wales' cancer treatment. The palace has been careful
*09:28.120- 09:34.220* :  with its words. She's not been described as cancer-free, but instead is said to be on a long
*09:34.220- 09:41.500* :  journey to a full recovery. The news came via a film produced by Kensington Palace. Glossy and
*09:41.500- 09:47.220* :  polished, it is narrated by the Princess. This is Catherine in her own words describing the
*09:47.220- 09:52.900* :  challenge over the past nine months of dealing with cancer. The last nine months have been
*09:52.900- 09:58.400* :  incredibly tough for us as a family. Life as you know can change in an instant, and we've had to
*09:58.400- 10:04.160* :  find a way to navigate the stormy waters in Road Unknown. It is unusual to see footage of the
*10:04.160- 10:09.600* :  royal family this intimate and personal. The film shows the Prince of Wales kissing his wife.
*10:10.200- 10:14.780* :  We see them walking and playing with their three children on the North Norfolk coast over the
*10:14.780- 10:22.060* :  summer, as the Princess reflects on how cancer has changed her. This time, as above all,
*10:22.060- 10:27.920* :  reminded William and me to reflect and be grateful for the simple yet important things in life,
*10:28.400- 10:34.040* :  which so many of us often take for granted, as simply loving and being loved.
*10:34.840- 10:39.740* :  The Princess is returned to public life, will be careful with a light schedule being planned,
*10:39.740- 10:44.760* :  that is likely to include Remembrance Sunday and events closer to Christmas.
*10:44.760- 10:54.080* :  Daniela Ralph. In Kenya, fleets of high-tech drones are delivering HIV drugs and testing kits
*10:54.080- 10:59.980* :  to rural areas, and they drop in their goods at places young people go, such as concerts and
*10:59.980- 11:06.000* :  football matches. It's part of an innovative project funded by the Elton John AIDS Foundation
*11:06.000- 11:11.100* :  to tackle a rise in the percentage of new HIV infections among young people.
*11:11.700- 11:14.920* :  Maira Anubi went to Western Kenya to see it in action.
*11:21.920- 11:27.500* :  From a launch pad just outside the city of Kisumu, a fixed-wing drone is fired into the sky,
*11:27.500- 11:34.240* :  carrying a cargo of HIV drugs and testing kits. Flying at speeds of up to 100 kilometres per hour,
*11:34.780- 11:38.380* :  they can deliver the drugs to remote areas quickly and accurately.
*11:39.420- 11:44.960* :  Sharon Omorja is in charge of flight operations for the drone delivery company Zipline.
*11:45.400- 11:49.440* :  Most of the areas we have, they have challenges like floods, so whenever it floods,
*11:49.440- 11:55.400* :  it's very hard to get to the health facilities and also we have the other challenge of the poor
*11:55.400- 12:00.480* :  road networks, so that's where the drone comes in because it can be able to bypass all those
*12:00.480- 12:05.600* :  challenges. To find out where a lot of these drones are taking their packages,
*12:05.920- 12:11.040* :  I took a ride on some bumpy roads to a rural part of the country. The project is targeting
*12:11.040- 12:16.160* :  young people, so the drones are taking HIV supplies to places where they're likely to go,
*12:16.160- 12:24.160* :  such as sport events. So we made it to a village called Nya Koko, and that you can hear it's
*12:24.320- 12:29.640* :  buzzing everywhere. It's an open field. There's a football tournament with girls and young boys
*12:29.640- 12:35.580* :  playing, but over to my right is a white tent and this is a mobile health clinic.
*12:36.320- 12:42.180* :  We are having an outreach activity. We are targeting adolescents and youths with
*12:42.840- 12:47.920* :  reproductive health services and HIV services. This is Joel Abor, one of the nurses.
*12:48.440- 12:52.500* :  He explained why young people prefer this to a formal healthcare facility.
*12:53.180- 12:59.280* :  It could be stigma. They feel that I'm going to a facility. Maybe a neighbor will see me,
*12:59.980- 13:06.160* :  we are in an African society, we've got our cultural beliefs, we've got our religious beliefs,
*13:06.540- 13:14.180* :  probably. That one could be acting as a barrier to them seeking health services as a facility.
*13:15.180- 13:20.960* :  So we are running out of trust condoms, we are running out of self-test kits.
*13:21.200- 13:25.380* :  When supplies start to run down, Joel can order new ones from Zipline on his phone,
*13:25.380- 13:31.760* :  and they're delivered in less than an hour. And our dropping point should be in the field around
*13:31.760- 13:39.160* :  where boys are being laid. The drone drops a small parachute with a red box attached.
*13:40.920- 13:46.780* :  It floats to the ground and Joel goes over to check he's got what he orders.
*13:49.640- 13:52.600* :  A curious crowd of young people have gathered to watch the drone.
*13:53.720- 13:58.580* :  So these are self-test kits and they are saying they know how to use them.
*13:58.900- 14:04.820* :  I don't want any women because it's too much. I'm asking him if he knows why it's important
*14:04.820- 14:11.200* :  to test your stuff. To prevent from HIV, to know your status, they say.
*14:11.740- 14:13.940* :  And if you know your status, why is that a good thing?
*14:14.300- 14:17.360* :  I don't know what you found. I don't know if they're my type of prayer.
*14:17.540- 14:20.960* :  Exactly. Once you know their status, they can plan their lives.
*14:21.700- 14:24.740* :  For other high-risk groups such as the transgender community,
*14:24.780- 14:31.900* :  this sort of outreach can also be a lifeline. Latoya Johnston works one organization called Transury.
*14:32.400- 14:35.080* :  Youth need youthful engagement.
*14:35.560- 14:42.840* :  You want to go and do the HIV testing in spaces that are friendly, that are also like youth
*14:42.840- 14:47.240* :  forecast. Right now if you come here and people are kicking football and there is also
*14:47.240- 14:51.700* :  the dance and the things like that, people will come in without even thinking that they are going
*14:51.700- 14:57.660* :  to go for testing. Zipline estimates that they've reached more than 80,000 young people
*14:58.140- 15:03.040* :  in the year and a half that the project has been going and more than 4,000 have now started
*15:03.040- 15:10.040* :  taking preventative drugs. Maira Anubi reporting and you can find out more about the project in
*15:10.040- 15:14.420* :  this week's edition of People Fixing the World on the BBC World Service.
*15:15.840- 15:22.360* :  The American actor known for one of cinema's most distinctive voices James Earl Jones has died.
*15:22.360- 15:28.440* :  He was 93. James Earl Jones started acting in Broadway taking on theatre roles including
*15:28.440- 15:34.880* :  King Lear and Othello, but he became famous as the voice of the evil Darth Vader in the
*15:34.880- 15:41.020* :  Star Wars films, Vincent Dowd reports. James Earl Jones grew up on his grand parents farm in
*15:41.020- 15:47.660* :  Michigan. The sympathetic teacher helped him conquer a severe speech defect, acting allowed him to
*15:47.660- 15:53.000* :  escape his early lack of self-confidence. I was mute until I was about 14 because I was a
*15:53.000- 15:58.840* :  mistutter. I still am a stutter and when I learned how to work around that stutter I learned the
*15:58.860- 16:05.520* :  great beauty in those who could speak. Though at countless screen credits but from 1977
*16:05.820- 16:11.540* :  it was a voice-only role which brought him fame throughout the English-speaking world.
*16:11.540- 16:19.320* :  In Star Wars producer George Lucas knew he needed to dub in an imposing voice for the Jedi gone
*16:32.920- 16:37.040* :  bad Darth Vader. There were many other screen parts including the voice only appearance in the
*16:37.040- 16:43.660* :  Lion King. For years James Earl Jones was the voice of news channel CNN but his defining role
*16:43.660- 16:51.320* :  was as the voice of one of the greatest bad guys in cinema history. Vincent Dowd on James Earl Jones
*16:51.320- 17:00.820* :  who's died. Coming up we hear from the double amputee who climbed Kilimanjaro just two years
*17:00.820- 17:08.480* :  after her injury. The whole landscape is bathed in this otherworldly pink glow and I was completely
*17:08.520- 17:11.560* :  overcome with emotion and literally birth and tears.
*17:38.300- 17:45.300* :  Tom is the one centralized platform for everything work related and with Monday.com work is just easier.

*17:51.240- 17:55.880* :  Hey I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are
*17:55.880- 18:00.780* :  allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes and then when I asked if raising prices
*18:00.780- 18:05.820* :  technically violates those owners to your contracts they said what the f**k are you talking about

*18:26.820- 18:32.360* :  Clean up efforts are underway in northern Vietnam following a weekend of devastation caused by
*18:32.360- 18:39.120* :  super typhoon Yagi Asia's most powerful storm this year. More than 60 people are reported to have
*18:39.120- 18:49.680* :  been killed. Ella Bicknell has this report. After devastating parts of China's high end province
*18:49.680- 18:56.680* :  and the Philippines on Saturday Yagi made landfall in Vietnam bringing winds up to 200 kilometers
*18:56.680- 19:03.000* :  an hour. Flash flooding and landslides followed. One alone is reported to have buried 17 people.
*19:03.000- 19:08.660* :  On Monday a bridge over the red river in Fudo province collapsed plunging several vehicles
*19:08.660- 19:15.140* :  into the water below. 13 people are still missing. These people survived. A dash cam in their car
*19:22.480- 19:26.480* :  recorded what happened. The vehicle was seconds away from reaching the bridge. Nguyen Min Hai was
*19:26.480- 19:34.920* :  riding a motorbike. He says he's lucky to still be alive. I was so scared when I fell down. I
*19:34.920- 19:40.640* :  feel like I've just escaped death. I can't swim and I thought I was going to die. In neighboring
*19:40.640- 19:46.620* :  in-bind province houses were left submerged under more than a meter of water and 200 kilometers
*19:46.620- 19:51.660* :  to the east. The coastal city of Hai Phong factories were destroyed including the walls of a plant
*19:51.660- 19:57.840* :  owned by South Korean electronics giant LG. Manufacturing in Vietnam is an essential link in the
*19:57.840- 20:04.180* :  supply chain for some of the world's biggest companies. Hai Phong's two million citizens are just
*20:04.180- 20:11.240* :  coming to terms with the devastation. Neighbors rally together to pull trees off the street
*20:11.640- 20:16.280* :  and shopkeeper BVN 2 has spent the day sweeping flood water off his porch.
*20:16.280- 20:25.960* :  The damage done to this community is extremely severe. Most of our roof was blown away
*20:25.960- 20:31.600* :  and the ceiling caved in. It may take three to four years for this place to look the same again
*20:31.600- 20:37.820* :  because the damage is so terrible. Vietnam's weather agency downgraded the storm on Sunday,
*20:37.820- 20:43.740* :  but it's warned of an ongoing risk of flooding and landslides. Millions of people are still without
*20:43.740- 20:49.460* :  power and authorities say it's one of the worst storms to have hit the country in more than 30 years.
*20:49.880- 20:56.400* :  Arabic no reporting. America's Midwest is sometimes derided as flyover country,
*20:56.860- 21:00.540* :  but it may hold the key to the outcome of November's presidential election.
*21:01.000- 21:07.360* :  It's home to two crucial swing states, Wisconsin and Michigan and both vice presidential nominees,
*21:07.360- 21:13.980* :  the Democrat Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walsh and the Ohio Senator, Republican JD Vance,
*21:14.420- 21:18.820* :  both with similarly folksy tones, but two very different visions.
*21:19.500- 21:23.380* :  I grew up in Middletown, Ohio. A small town where people spoke their minds,
*21:23.420- 21:27.960* :  built with their hands and loved their god, their family, their community and their
*21:27.960- 21:32.960* :  country with their whole hearts. But it was also a place that had been cast aside and forgotten
*21:32.960- 21:39.260* :  by America's ruling class in Washington. Now I grew up in Butte Nebraska,
*21:39.820- 21:44.280* :  growing up in a small town like that, you'll learn how to take care of each other.
*21:44.540- 21:50.480* :  That family down the road, they may not think like you do, but they're your neighbors.
*21:51.760- 21:55.340* :  And you look out for them and they look out for you.
*21:55.980- 22:02.140* :  Tim Walsh and before him, JD Vance, another Midwestan state is Missouri and my colleague James
*22:02.140- 22:09.420* :  Menendez has visited a rodeo there in the town of Defiance, about an hour out of St. Louis.
*22:09.760- 22:14.260* :  He went to hear what Midwesterners are really like and what they want from their politicians.
*22:25.440- 22:31.280* :  We drink soda in that pop. We have pork steaks, toaster raviolis. We live in Missouri,
*22:31.280- 22:37.080* :  not Missouri. I've got to ask you about tasty raviolis because they're not really tasty,
*22:37.080- 22:44.600* :  they're deep fried, aren't they? Only Missouri, buddy. We have a really strong root of values and
*22:44.600- 22:49.340* :  morals and you have a tendency to see like a sense of community more I think in the Midwest and
*22:49.740- 22:54.500* :  I think a lot of people still yearn for that. Days gone by, simple life, neighbors looking out
*22:54.500- 22:59.420* :  for each other and it's just that sense of like we're all in this together and in cities you don't
*22:59.420- 23:06.300* :  have that. I think we're good people, at least for me, I know I try to find the good and everybody.
*23:06.300- 23:12.060* :  Polite, there's no reason to be mean or rude, I mean there's just life's too short.
*23:12.200- 23:18.700* :  The cowboy hats and boots feel like a world away from St. Louis but the link is the man who's
*23:18.720- 23:25.520* :  put on the rodeo, Billy Bush, one of the ares to the Budweiser beer fortune. The family brewery now
*23:25.520- 23:32.040* :  sold off is still in the city and the family name is everywhere but Billy prefers life out here
*23:32.400- 23:37.560* :  in the country. It's a great place to grow up, it's where my great-grandfather landed when he came
*23:37.560- 23:43.880* :  over from Europe, he saw the business along the Mississippi River, it's where our roots are and it's
*23:43.880- 23:49.860* :  where my family built an incredible business, you know, a beer dynasty if you will. A well-famous
*23:49.860- 23:54.540* :  business, a Budweiser beer of course and how do you feel we're coming up to an election in November?
*23:55.160- 24:00.800* :  The Midwest is front and center of this campaign for both parties, both the vice-presidential
*24:00.800- 24:06.960* :  candidates are from the Midwest and it's gratifying that people are paying attention to the Midwest
*24:06.960- 24:13.400* :  because often people say that they feel a bit forgotten by whether it's Washington or people on
*24:13.400- 24:18.620* :  the coast, LA, New York, I mean is that fair? I think the Midwest it's very important for the
*24:18.620- 24:24.140* :  candidates this year and every state's going to be very important of Missouri's red state.
*24:24.400- 24:27.780* :  Yeah, nothing's going to change here, is it? I don't think anything's going to change here,
*24:27.780- 24:33.440* :  you know, we have conservative values here, the values of hard work and faith are born here in
*24:33.440- 24:38.280* :  the Midwest really are. Can we talk a bit about immigration? It's a big topic in this election,
*24:38.520- 24:43.520* :  I mean your family story of course is one of immigration in the 19th century from Germany
*24:44.520- 24:50.180* :  and your forefathers saw the potential as you say of this land. What does that have to tell us
*24:50.180- 24:53.980* :  about you know what's happening today? Well you know there's nothing wrong with immigrants,
*24:53.980- 24:58.360* :  that's what this country was founded on. It's just how immigrants come into our country,
*24:58.360- 25:04.080* :  are they coming in legally or are they coming in illegally? Illegal immigration seems to be giving
*25:04.080- 25:10.060* :  all immigrants a bad name these days and it shouldn't be that way but unfortunately with the
*25:10.060- 25:15.420* :  borders being left open as they have been under the current administration, the immigrants now,
*25:15.420- 25:21.040* :  all immigrants seem to have suffered from it. I hope that changes, I hope we get back to the basics
*25:21.040- 25:26.640* :  of the way we used to do things and you know vet these people before they come in the United States
*25:26.660- 25:31.020* :  to make sure they're here to work and not cause problems in our country. Lord knows we have
*25:31.020- 25:36.080* :  enough of that already. And is Donald Trump then the man to do that? I think for sure he's a man
*25:36.080- 25:42.660* :  to do that. I think you know his policies on immigration, on the economy, on our world affairs,
*25:42.660- 25:49.220* :  crime in the streets and other things have been really good for America. I think this we need him
*25:49.220- 25:55.420* :  back in the Oval Office to run this country again. On the issue of immigration it's worth saying that
*25:55.420- 26:01.440* :  Missouri desperately needs more people to come and work here. St. Louis in particular is one of the
*26:01.440- 26:08.500* :  fastest shrinking cities in the country but in a red state, solidly Republican, that's not a
*26:08.500- 26:14.380* :  message you're likely to hear in the run up to the election. James Melendez reporting from St. Louis
*26:14.380- 26:20.900* :  Missouri with its pristine beaches and party atmosphere. The Indonesian island of Bali is
*26:20.900- 26:28.040* :  popular with budget backpackers and tourists enjoying luxury resorts but too many visitors
*26:28.560- 26:34.480* :  has become a cause of concern for the islands acting governor who's proposing a two-year ban on
*26:34.480- 26:39.740* :  building new hotels, villas and nightclubs. This follows a crackdown earlier this year on bad
*26:39.740- 26:45.080* :  behavior by some western tourists. I heard more from our Asia Pacific regional editor,
*26:45.080- 26:50.620* :  Celia Hatten, who's visited the island. I have been to Bali. It was quite quiet when I was there.
*26:50.620- 26:57.680* :  It is not that way now and officials are saying and locals alike and even tourists who go there and
*26:57.680- 27:03.800* :  are paying increasingly eye-watering prices for the right to stay there are really worried because
*27:04.260- 27:09.880* :  Bali is an island so that means it has limited space, limited resources and it's dealing with over
*27:09.880- 27:15.860* :  tourism. That's when the number of visitors exceed capacity. So Nick, if we go back to 2021,
*27:15.900- 27:22.800* :  the height of COVID, there are only 51 foreign tourists visiting the island that year. In the first
*27:22.800- 27:27.820* :  six months of this year, we've already had almost three million tourists. That's huge. I mean,
*27:27.820- 27:33.820* :  the island itself. Yeah, well, there's a population of 4.4 million people on the island, but you know,
*27:33.820- 27:38.560* :  the people who run it, the acting governor and others are saying, look, we just need to put a hold
*27:38.960- 27:45.600* :  on more development. No more luxury resorts, nightclubs that are basically paving over what is
*27:45.900- 27:50.620* :  paradise. And they're worried about the numbers coming and also the type of person coming. I
*27:50.620- 27:54.560* :  mentioned that some people have been behaving quite badly. What kind of things have been going on?
*27:54.640- 27:59.920* :  Well, we've been seeing a lot of issues with people who are going to Bali and aren't really paying
*27:59.920- 28:04.800* :  attention to Bali's unique culture. So we've had a lot of locals who are upset by those who perhaps
*28:04.800- 28:11.000* :  dress inappropriately when visiting a sacred temple. We've also had a lot of drunkenness,
*28:11.000- 28:17.480* :  fights, violence, crime, tourists begging for money on the streets of Bali simply because they
*28:17.480- 28:22.200* :  run out of money. They can't get off the island. So we've had a lot of concerns about that. So not
*28:22.200- 28:27.540* :  just over development, but over tourism and this ban on building. It's a proposition from the
*28:27.540- 28:31.700* :  acting governor. Is it likely to get through? Do you think I think it's getting a lot of support.
*28:31.700- 28:37.120* :  In fact, one other Indonesian official was proposing a 10 year ban saying that that's what's
*28:37.120- 28:42.020* :  really needed to put a stop to things because construction is just proceeding at such a rapid pace
*28:42.020- 28:45.980* :  right now. This is the popular move is it potentially. It seems so. I think locals are really
*28:45.980- 28:51.140* :  pushing for it as well because the things that make Bali beautiful, the rice terraces, the greenery,
*28:51.140- 28:55.900* :  those things are really disappearing at a very quick rate. Celia Hatton.
*28:56.740- 29:02.440* :  And finally, a British woman who lost an arm and a leg in a train accident just two years ago
*29:02.920- 29:09.140* :  had just become the first female double amputee to scale Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro.
*29:09.920- 29:14.040* :  Sarah De La Guard first climbed the mountain about a month before her accident.
*29:14.920- 29:19.820* :  But when she slipped and fell onto train tracks and was struck first by one train and then another,
*29:19.820- 29:25.680* :  she probably thought her mountain climbing days were over. But not so. Rebecca Kersby spoke to Sarah
*29:26.120- 29:30.320* :  and asked her how it felt to get to the top of Kilimanjaro for a second time.
*29:31.020- 29:37.300* :  Oh, it was absolutely amazing. So you basically start from base camp at around midnight. You
*29:37.300- 29:45.200* :  hike up the mountain for about seven hours. You get to the top just as day breaks and it's
*29:45.560- 29:51.480* :  absolutely incredibly beautiful. The the whole landscape is bathed in this otherworldly
*29:51.760- 29:56.440* :  pink glow. And of course, it's extremely difficult to be at that altitude.
*29:57.220- 30:04.240* :  Breathing is very labored. There is 49% less oxygen up there. So it really feels like you breathe
*30:04.240- 30:13.060* :  with one lung. But we made it to the top and I touched a sign and I was completely overcome with
*30:13.060- 30:18.240* :  emotion and literally birth entities. Well, yeah, I mean, it must have been such an emotional
*30:18.240- 30:23.240* :  experience making it for the second time given everything you'd been through.
*30:24.220- 30:29.660* :  Absolutely. So it I thought it was completely impossible. The first time around it was
*30:30.060- 30:37.160* :  dream ten years into making for my husbands and I we turned 40 and didn't have an opportunity
*30:37.160- 30:42.280* :  to celebrate. So we thought it would be fantastic to climb up that mountain and it was really hard
*30:42.280- 30:52.080* :  the first time around. But little did I know what was awaiting afterwards. The incident my my
*30:52.940- 30:59.580* :  you know, life changing injuries gave me the impression that none of this would be ever possible
*30:59.580- 31:06.220* :  again. Well, that must have been very difficult to to try to come to terms with. But it seems
*31:06.220- 31:13.580* :  as if you still had a hope that you would do something like this again. Is it true that
*31:13.580- 31:20.120* :  your mum brought a picture in of the summit of Kilimanjaro to inspire you? Yes, she did. And it
*31:20.120- 31:25.420* :  was really strange that in the aftermath and I was still in in the trauma ward and later in
*31:26.480- 31:32.960* :  the rehabilitation centre. And yet individuals would my friends, my colleagues, my family would come
*31:33.640- 31:41.900* :  to see me and say this, oh, you'll be able to climb up Kilimanjaro one day and it sounded to me
*31:41.900- 31:47.820* :  like they wanted to reassure themselves at the same time. And for me, I laughed bitterly at the time
*31:47.820- 31:53.040* :  thinking, well, but I can't even get out of bed to go to the bathroom by myself. How on earth
*31:53.460- 32:00.960* :  will I be able to climb a mountain that is almost at 6,000 metres in altitude, impossible.
*32:02.260- 32:10.080* :  And yet it was a fictitious goal that over time motivated me at the time, but over time it became
*32:11.200- 32:18.400* :  a crazy reality. Well, I mean, your injuries were obviously very serious. You've got two prosthetic
*32:18.400- 32:24.040* :  limbs, I think, an arm and a leg. And no doubt over the past two years, you'd have had so much
*32:24.420- 32:32.580* :  rehab and physio to try to get your fitness back. How was it climbing with your prosthetics?
*32:32.640- 32:38.540* :  Was it more dangerous in any way or did you have to take extra precautions because of that?
*32:39.640- 32:47.500* :  Yes, of course. I had to have a whole team to support me to get up there. You can't do it on your
*32:47.500- 32:55.540* :  own for sure. And I needed to have the prosthetics fitting to the millimeter to avoid injury,
*32:55.540- 33:03.900* :  overuse of my limbs, chafing, blistering. And I had two medical professionals joined me after
*33:03.900- 33:11.980* :  mountain. They were looking after me extremely well. Balance is a complete danger for me now.
*33:12.440- 33:17.960* :  If I lose it, I could just tumble down a mountain because both amputations are on the same side
*33:17.960- 33:25.540* :  that adds to the difficulty, for sure. And climbing Kilimanjaro for anybody is really
*33:25.540- 33:30.120* :  mentally tough, too, isn't it? Because you've already mentioned it's that altitude is very
*33:30.120- 33:37.260* :  steep in parts. Do you think, though, that the second time, maybe your mental ability was even
*33:37.260- 33:44.220* :  tougher than the first time? Yes. And there was a moment where, particularly on the last day,
*33:44.220- 33:50.940* :  on the final attempt, where I questioned my life choices, really, where, why don't I just go and
*33:50.940- 33:59.360* :  relax on a beach? But at no point did I think that I reached my limit because the past two years
*33:59.360- 34:08.580* :  had been so incredibly difficult. I mean, physically, yes, completely difficult, but at the same time,
*34:09.120- 34:14.400* :  the mental resilience that I needed to build out, that was what helped me ultimately up to the top.
