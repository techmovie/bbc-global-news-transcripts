*01:24.780- 01:29.460* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Monday the 2nd of September.
*01:30.000- 01:35.400* :  Exit polls in Germany suggest a far-right party has won a regional state election for the first time
*01:35.400- 01:42.060* :  since the Nazi era. Protests have erupted in Israel after six hostages were killed in Gaza.
*01:42.580- 01:48.820* :  The unions have called a general strike and Ukraine's second city Harkiv has come under heavy attack by Russia.
*01:49.260- 01:56.000* :  Also in the podcast. When he was first spotted, he was wearing a camera
*01:56.000- 02:01.500* :  attached to a harness, labeled Equipment of St Petersburg. This and his friendliness towards
*02:01.500- 02:06.420* :  humans sparked rumors the mumble had been trained by the Russian Navy as a spy will.
*02:06.980- 02:11.360* :  The mysterious death of a young whale allegedly recruited by the Russians.
*02:16.460- 02:21.820* :  A far-right party is on course to win a state parliamentary election in Germany for the first time
*02:21.820- 02:28.180* :  since the Nazis. According to exit polls, the AFD or alternative for Deutschland looks set to
*02:28.180- 02:33.840* :  become the biggest party in Therungia, while coming a close second in Saxony. Both states are in
*02:33.840- 02:40.080* :  the former East Germany and a fertile ground for the party's anti-immigration anti-Islam message.
*02:40.220- 02:45.720* :  The regional elections came just over a week after a mass stabbing by a suspected Islamist
*02:46.040- 02:51.320* :  in the German city of Zorlingen. Bj√∂rn Herker, controversial head of the AFD in Therungia,
*02:51.700- 03:00.180* :  hailed what he called a historic result. First they ignore you, then they laugh at you,
*03:00.500- 03:09.220* :  then they fight you, and then you win. And today dear friends, we have won.
*03:13.680- 03:19.400* :  Well, despite its victory, the AFD may struggle to find coalition partners, but the result is
*03:19.420- 03:24.960* :  another sign of how voters are abandoning the centre ground with a new far-left party coming
*03:24.960- 03:31.740* :  third in both states. It is a significant blow to the governing SPD and other mainstream parties in
*03:31.740- 03:38.180* :  Germany, no Schmidt as the social democratic party spokesman on foreign affairs. I think this is
*03:38.180- 03:45.580* :  a rather new challenge to German democracy because for many years most Germans trusted
*03:45.580- 03:53.420* :  democracy to work things out. And for the first time at least since I'm active in politics,
*03:53.420- 04:02.180* :  we see large parts of German society just dropping out of the democratic discourse and of the
*04:02.180- 04:07.880* :  workings of the democratic system. But what has attracted voters to the AFD? A question
*04:07.880- 04:13.740* :  Alex Ritsen put to our correspondent in Therungia, Jessica Barker. This has been cooking for quite
*04:13.740- 04:18.860* :  a long time. There's a few things driving it. Frustration with immigration policy, people very
*04:18.860- 04:23.620* :  frustrated by what they see as a failure of mainstream parties to deliver stronger controls,
*04:23.620- 04:28.880* :  frustration in the east about the way reunification has been handled, and feelings of inequality
*04:28.880- 04:34.980* :  between the east and the west. And the AFD's anti-establishment message seems to
*04:34.980- 04:41.320* :  time with people here. There's other policy issues as well, such as their call to stop
*04:41.320- 04:45.620* :  any weapons to Ukraine. And just overall a frustration with the parties that have dominated
*04:45.620- 04:52.440* :  German politics over recent decades. They're detractors, call them Nazis. Are they? And what does
*04:52.440- 04:59.560* :  their election mean for German politics? They are designeces here in Therungia, this state,
*04:59.560- 05:04.780* :  by domestic intelligence as right-wing extremist. Beyond hooker, the leader of the party here in
*05:04.780- 05:10.020* :  Therungia is a particular lightning rod for controversy. And to give you sort of examples as to
*05:10.660- 05:17.740* :  why this Nazi narrative comes up and criticism comes up, he was fined twice this year
*05:18.080- 05:24.800* :  for knowingly a court found using a Nazi slogan. He denied knowing of its origin. But if it's
*05:24.800- 05:30.080* :  things like that that have contributed to deep concern about some of the people within the
*05:30.080- 05:34.480* :  alternative for Deutschland, but he actually is even a controversial figure within the party,
*05:34.480- 05:39.240* :  there have previously been efforts to kick him out over other things that he has said. However,
*05:39.240- 05:44.760* :  what the AFD will say is that the government, domestic intelligence, the media is basically
*05:44.760- 05:48.820* :  conspiring against them and smearing their movement. And that is something you hear over and over
*05:48.820- 05:52.400* :  again, whether it's AFD activists or just people who are thinking of supporting the AFD.
*05:52.700- 05:59.700* :  What impact might this result have on wider German policies on migration on Ukraine?
*06:00.700- 06:05.000* :  On migration, it's already started to have an impact. Last week in the wake of Zolingen,
*06:05.360- 06:11.000* :  the traffic-like coalition government were announcing tougher controls on knife crime and asylum laws,
*06:11.000- 06:16.000* :  the CDU, the Conservative Opposition Party. They've been striking a tougher tone as well.
*06:16.000- 06:21.820* :  So you're already seeing some shifting narratives. This is a year out from the federal elections
*06:21.820- 06:28.060* :  and the coalition government of Chancellor Schultz's SPD, the Greens and the Liberals. They are not
*06:28.060- 06:32.780* :  popular. They are very publicly divided on a number of issues. There's almost kind of a post-mortem
*06:32.780- 06:37.620* :  conversation going on already. No one seems to expect that this framework can hold into the
*06:37.620- 06:42.320* :  next election. I think the CDU have hopes of becoming the largest party in that election,
*06:42.320- 06:46.160* :  but certainly the AFD do appear to be on the march, particularly here in the east.
*06:46.300- 06:50.860* :  Their popularity actually slipped over the year from a high point early in January on a national
*06:50.860- 06:55.180* :  level, but they really have held up in the east. Although there's also another interesting
*06:55.180- 07:00.420* :  insurgent force with the Saravagan Connect Alliance, a new party launched this year and she's
*07:00.420- 07:05.800* :  done really well. Projections suggest that in Saxony, she's got 11.9% of the votes which
*07:05.800- 07:11.440* :  are in a new party this year and here in Turinga, 15.5% of the vote. And for a party that's launched
*07:11.740- 07:15.560* :  just this year, that's quite an incredible position to catapult yourself into.
*07:15.920- 07:21.520* :  The BBC's Jessica Parker in Turingia in Germany. Israel has blamed her mass for the killing of
*07:21.520- 07:26.300* :  six hostages whose bodies were recovered from a tunnel in southern Gaza on Saturday,
*07:27.020- 07:30.900* :  but some of the families of the captives are angry at the Israeli government's failure to
*07:30.900- 07:36.360* :  agree a deal to get them out. Israeli trade unions are increasing the pressure on the Prime
*07:36.360- 07:41.880* :  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. They're calling a general
*07:41.880- 07:47.260* :  strike. The Israeli authorities say the six hostages were shot at close range shortly before
*07:47.260- 07:52.860* :  the military reached them. On Sunday, there were huge protests in Tel Aviv and outside Mr Netanyahu's
*07:52.860- 07:57.400* :  office in Jerusalem, our mid-least correspondent Lucy Williamson has this report.
*07:58.240- 08:04.000* :  Their faces have become icons here. Their names as familiar to Israelis as those of their own
*08:04.000- 08:11.360* :  friends. 23-year-old Hirsch Goldberg-Pollin, an American Israeli. Elmorg-Sarussi.
*08:12.060- 08:17.440* :  Ori-Danino. Alexander Lobanov, who never got to meet his new baby.
*08:18.300- 08:23.480* :  Therapist Kamel Gatt, described by other hostages as their guardian angel.
*08:24.520- 08:29.300* :  Edna Roshalmi, whose last words to her sister were, they've caught me.
*08:29.920- 08:34.720* :  The argument, the comfort of many, was that Hamas would protect them as assets,
*08:35.480- 08:39.360* :  that younger, fitter hostages like these were the ones who would survive.
*08:40.300- 08:44.880* :  Instead, Israel's army says they were shot by Hamas in a tunnel under raffer
*08:44.880- 08:51.820* :  as Israeli forces battled above them. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas would
*08:51.820- 08:59.540* :  pay the price. While Israel is conducting intensive negotiations with the mediators in a
*08:59.540- 09:05.380* :  supreme effort to reach a deal, Hamas continues to firmly refuse any offer. He,
*09:05.640- 09:08.000* :  who murders hostages, does not want to deal.
*09:12.740- 09:18.700* :  Outside Mr Netanyahu's office, thousands came to protest, a giant red flag above them,
*09:19.180- 09:22.780* :  a signal they said that the last red line had been crossed.
*09:24.680- 09:27.960* :  Outside the Israeli Prime Minister's office, the crowd have been shouting,
*09:27.960- 09:35.220* :  murderer is a real sense of anger here. One woman said it feels like October all over again.
*09:35.760- 09:40.820* :  The crowd here are holding posters of the six hostages that have been confirmed,
*09:40.860- 09:48.020* :  dead, and Israeli flags that have been altered to include the yellow ribbon symbol of the hostage
*09:48.020- 09:54.420* :  families. Many of the people here believe Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister,
*09:54.840- 10:00.000* :  just doesn't want a deal. And if a deal is no longer possible, they say,
*10:00.700- 10:03.280* :  then the hostages are no longer valuable to Hamas.
*10:05.200- 10:08.900* :  Lee Seagal's brother Keith is still being held captive in Gaza.
*10:17.440- 10:22.760* :  As one of the hostages, Al-Mogsarousi was buried in Israel, new protests were born.
*10:22.780- 10:27.520* :  Israel's labor union has called a general strike to press for a ceasefire deal.
*10:28.280- 10:34.120* :  Benjamin Netanyahu is being confronted with a choice, peace in Gaza, or war at home.
*10:34.880- 10:41.280* :  Lucy Williamson in Jerusalem. Well last week, the BBC heard from the mother of Hirsch Goldberg
*10:41.280- 10:47.020* :  polling, one of the hostages found dead on Saturday. In that interview, Rachel Goldberg spoke
*10:47.020- 10:52.240* :  about how the fate of the hostages rested with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*10:52.660- 10:59.180* :  and the Hamas leader, Yaya Sinwa. There are two men who hold the decision, just two,
*11:00.180- 11:06.320* :  and until those two men decide that this game, which we feel that it is a game, that we are
*11:06.320- 11:12.360* :  pawns in a game, that are our loved ones, our children, our spouses, our mothers, our fathers,
*11:12.360- 11:18.280* :  our grandparents, and our grandchildren, and all of the innocent people in Gaza are pawns in
*11:18.280- 11:24.840* :  this game between these two men, until these two people decide that each is going to give in a
*11:24.840- 11:30.620* :  little bit, and stop this for the sake of the people in the entire region who are suffering
*11:30.620- 11:39.080* :  horrendously. It won't end. So on the one hand, I'm heartened that people are beginning,
*11:39.100- 11:45.360* :  after almost a year, to understand the complexity of this situation, and that it should not be
*11:45.800- 11:53.360* :  them or us. But on the other hand, it's not in those hands. It's in the hands of these two men.
*11:54.240- 12:00.700* :  Rachel Goldberg talked to BBC last week. Well, Sharon Leaveschitz is a London-based filmmaker whose
*12:00.700- 12:06.900* :  parents were taken hostage on the 7th of October. Her mother was freed, but her 83-year-old father,
*12:06.900- 12:12.920* :  Odead, is still missing, presumed captive in the Gaza Strip. So how she had any news of her father?
*12:13.660- 12:22.460* :  I haven't had a sign of life for many months, so there's no news of my father.
*12:23.360- 12:29.620* :  We know his in Gaza, we know he was alive, and he was with other hostages in the first weeks,
*12:29.620- 12:36.520* :  but we have no further knowledge of his well-being, his whereabouts, his condition.
*12:36.920- 12:41.540* :  And obviously you're worried sick, and your mother is worried sick. So what do you think
*12:42.640- 12:46.400* :  needs to be done about it? Can you see any way to help him?
*12:47.580- 12:54.260* :  I think at the moment, this must be the killing of the six young hostages in cold blood.
*12:55.020- 13:01.320* :  These hostages were very much alive, less than a week ago. They were killed because there's a
*13:01.320- 13:07.400* :  delay in signing the deal, Israel government and Hamas are putting more and more obstacles in
*13:07.400- 13:14.000* :  the way of reaching this deal. And it is the hope of myself and many families and many
*13:14.000- 13:22.080* :  same citizens of this part of the world that these deaths would lead to an uproar by hundreds
*13:22.080- 13:28.960* :  of thousands of Israelis and across the world that will force the hand of the government of Israel
*13:29.300- 13:35.940* :  and of Hamas to sign this deal and bring about an end to this horrific, horrific episode.
*13:36.700- 13:42.920* :  I think the Israeli government's point of view is that it needs to, as they put it, finally defeat
*13:43.500- 13:46.900* :  Hamas first. I mean, can you understand that position?
*13:47.880- 13:51.560* :  I think that the governments of Israel often come up with this saying, no,
*13:51.780- 13:57.980* :  for well that it is impossible to defeat Hamas by keep fighting like that. It will take years
*13:58.660- 14:05.820* :  and really it will cause so much hate and death and carnage that the new people will join Hamas then.
*14:05.820- 14:13.040* :  The way to defeat Hamas is to make an alliance of saying Muslim and countries and Israel
*14:13.620- 14:18.740* :  that wants security and stability in the region. That will be the way to defeat Hamas by
*14:18.740- 14:23.240* :  defeating the causes that lead people to join Hamas in the first place.
*14:23.900- 14:29.920* :  Right, so that's your point of view. Why do you think the Israeli government doesn't agree with you?
*14:31.280- 14:38.520* :  I think the Israeli government is led by a bunch of extremist people that do not in any way
*14:39.200- 14:45.080* :  reflect the majority of the people of Israel, 60 percent of the population in Israel believe
*14:45.080- 14:50.460* :  that a deal should be reached, that the proposed deal should be reached. And so they're working
*14:50.460- 14:57.220* :  a very much against the interest of the majority, only 12 percent are against the deal.
*14:57.680- 15:02.160* :  The majority of the Israeli population, they're doing that for their own political survival,
*15:02.740- 15:08.480* :  they're doing that because they know that once the war is over, then the citizens of Israel will
*15:08.480- 15:15.440* :  demand an election. And it's very much put an end to this government, that is the worst government
*15:15.440- 15:23.020* :  that Israel ever had. And I don't think there's any evidence that hostages release so far have been
*15:23.300- 15:28.140* :  listening to the BBC World Service, but we do broadcast in the Middle East. And hostages in the
*15:28.140- 15:34.820* :  past have been given radios to listen to us. If your father is listening, what do you want to say to him?
*15:36.200- 15:44.840* :  I want to tell him that we're holding on to mom, it's her birthday today, she's 86, she's amazing,
*15:45.320- 15:52.560* :  he's amazing, they celebrated every birthday she had in the last 65 years together,
*15:53.700- 16:00.180* :  and we can't wait for both of them to be reunited and we'll make more birthdays
*16:00.420- 16:01.100* :  then.
*16:06.480- 16:12.320* :  A beluga whale suspected of being trained as a spy by Russia has been found dead off the Norwegian
*16:12.320- 16:18.640* :  coast. The body of the animal was found floating in a bay in southern Norway as Clizia Sala reports.
*16:19.300- 16:24.800* :  The cause of death of the beluga in Norwegian waters is a mistaring itself, he was young and had
*16:24.800- 16:30.940* :  no visible injuries, so his body was taken to the nearest port for examination. When he was first
*16:30.940- 16:36.220* :  spotted off the coast of Norway five years ago, he was wearing a camera attached to a harness,
*16:36.220- 16:42.240* :  labelled Equipment of St Petersburg. This and his friendliness towards humans sparked rumors
*16:42.240- 16:47.540* :  that mumble had been trained by the Russian Navy as a spy will. Experts say this has happened
*16:47.540- 16:52.240* :  in the past, Moscow never responded to the allegations. Clizia Sala.
*16:55.140- 16:57.180* :  And still to come on the Global News podcast?

*18:36.340- 18:40.700* :  The Bengal famine in the middle of the Second World War led to the deaths of at least
*18:40.700- 18:46.580* :  three million Indians who at the time were British subjects. It was one of the largest losses
*18:46.580- 18:51.540* :  of civilian life on the Allied side and isn't remembered with a memorial or even a plaque.
*18:51.540- 18:57.780* :  Kavita Puri traveled deep into the countryside in West Bengal to meet some of the few survivors left.
*18:58.420- 19:02.680* :  They were speaking about the tragedy for the first time and some of their recollections are
*19:02.680- 19:12.700* :  distressing. I was only nine years old then. During the famine, my father was poor. He could no longer
*19:12.700- 19:20.760* :  afford to buy rice. He took us to Kolkata. He said, if we lived here, we would die of hunger.
*19:21.540- 19:26.480* :  Jummana Pukayev is 91. She is tiny, but speaks with authority.
*19:28.060- 19:33.620* :  He carried me on his shoulder from the village to the station. My mother and brother were with us.
*19:34.560- 19:40.760* :  We went by train towards Kolkata. The train was packed. Many haven't bought tickets. They were
*19:40.760- 19:47.100* :  desperate. It was a harrowing scene and almost unimaginable that a nine-year-old could witness
*19:47.100- 19:54.580* :  such suffering. Babies were hungry and crying for food. Our mother was holding her baby on her breast,
*19:56.060- 20:03.220* :  but she was not able to feed her as she was not producing any milk. Her breast had dried off from
*20:03.220- 20:12.120* :  starvation. The baby died while on her breast in the train. Once in Kolkata, there were many people
*20:12.120- 20:18.620* :  on the streets. They were asking for food or money. Soon she joined them. She's never
*20:18.620- 20:25.880* :  forgotten one young girl who showed her kindness. She was fair, a bit blump. The girl gave us two
*20:25.880- 20:34.020* :  pieces of bread with jaggery. My brother ate one and I ate the other piece. Our parents didn't eat
*20:34.020- 20:41.280* :  any. Her father soon managed to get a job so they were just about surviving. If you had stayed
*20:41.280- 20:47.460* :  and not gone to Kolkata, do you think you would have survived? We would have been dead.
*20:49.160- 20:56.580* :  We wouldn't have survived. We would have had no food. We would have starved to death.
*20:57.500- 21:05.560* :  That was the reason why Dad took us there. We traveled deeper into the Sunderban jungle
*21:05.560- 21:12.020* :  near the border with Bangladesh and stopped at a mud house. An elderly man is sitting, waiting.
*21:12.780- 21:20.100* :  He's bare-chested in a dirty. He's in his 90s and his name is Sheikh Qasem. His voice is a whisper.
*21:20.300- 21:28.800* :  My older brother died of hunger. I was very young at the time. I was crying so much uncontrollably.
*21:28.800- 21:35.800* :  My mother couldn't stop me. These survivors, old now, towards the end of their days,
*21:36.620- 21:42.480* :  lived through a devastating famine when they were British subjects, forgotten casualties of World
*21:42.480- 21:50.400* :  War II, but they didn't forget, even if others may have. When I think of my older brother,
*21:51.880- 22:03.020* :  I feel very sad. I weep. I still cry for him. He had left us. It is now my time to leave to one.
*22:05.820- 22:12.320* :  Now report from West Bengal by Kevita Puri. Ukraine's Second City Harkiv suffered a heavy
*22:12.320- 22:17.240* :  Russian missile attack on Sunday evening. Officials said more than 40 people were injured,
*22:17.240- 22:22.560* :  five of them children. President Zelensky renewed his call for Ukraine to be allowed to use
*22:22.560- 22:28.260* :  western-supplied weapons deeper inside Russian territory. Earlier the Danish Prime Minister,
*22:28.260- 22:33.760* :  Method Fredrickson and other NATO leaders at a security forum in Prague said they supported
*22:33.760- 22:39.120* :  the lifting of restrictions. His are security correspondent Frank Gardner. Ukraine said Denmark's
*22:39.120- 22:44.120* :  Prime Minister should get all the military-supported needs without the restrictions on weapons use,
*22:44.340- 22:49.520* :  currently being imposed by certain donor countries. Of course, everything has to be in order with
*22:49.520- 22:55.280* :  international law, but as long as it is, according to international law, I would suggest,
*22:55.320- 23:01.700* :  and my advice to all of us is to not talk about restrictions and put the other way around.
*23:01.700- 23:09.320* :  They need to be able to defend themselves, and self-defense is also about using weapons the other way.
*23:09.600- 23:14.780* :  The US and Germany are known to be the most wary of lifting those restrictions for fear of
*23:14.780- 23:20.600* :  escalation and dragging NATO into direct confrontation with Russia, but Denmark's Method Fredrickson
*23:20.600- 23:26.460* :  told the Globesack Security Conference here in Prague that in her words, all discussions about
*23:26.460- 23:32.340* :  Russia's red lines must end. The head of the Czech army, General Rekha, said the recent Ukrainian
*23:32.340- 23:37.920* :  incursion into Russia's Kursk region showed that NATO should not be scared of Moscow's threatened
*23:37.920- 23:42.620* :  red lines. Western assessments of Russian intentions, he said, were too cautious.
*23:43.200- 23:47.280* :  The former commander of U.S. land forces in Europe, Lieutenant-General Ben Hodges,
*23:47.620- 23:51.580* :  went further and was sharply critical of his own country's policy of restraint,
*23:51.580- 23:56.700* :  not allowing Ukraine to use long-range weapons, like the Army Tactical Missile System,
*23:56.700- 24:02.700* :  inside Russia, he said, was doing more to protect Russian airfields than it was to protect Ukrainian
*24:02.700- 24:06.760* :  civilians from attack. Our Security Correspondent Frank Gardner.
*24:07.720- 24:12.220* :  The Nigerian team at the Paralympics must be hopeful of a good showing in the powerlifting.
*24:12.800- 24:17.700* :  After all, they have topped the medall table at two of the last three games.
*24:18.520- 24:21.500* :  That success has been driven by the women powerlifters,
*24:21.900- 24:28.020* :  including Follashade Olua Femiyaho, who turned to the sport after her dreams of becoming a nurse
*24:28.020- 24:32.580* :  were crushed. She faced many other challenges on her way to medall success,
*24:33.180- 24:35.860* :  as Isaiah Akin-Remi found out when he met her.
*24:39.400- 24:45.000* :  Nigeria's female powerlifters are used to push into limits. At the Tokyo Paralympics
*24:45.000- 24:51.900* :  three years ago, the one six medals, with three of them gold, and Follashade Olua Femiyaho was
*24:51.900- 24:57.500* :  among the champions. Tokyo 2020 was one of the best games.
*24:58.060- 25:02.260* :  My first outing with your London 2012, it was a great experience for me.
*25:02.600- 25:05.940* :  Then, going to Tokyo again is a great one.
*25:06.720- 25:10.160* :  The 39-year-old picked up a silver at those London games,
*25:10.720- 25:15.420* :  and has since enjoyed huge medal success with world and commonwealth titans.
*25:15.920- 25:20.960* :  But this was not a first choice of career. After cutting polio as a young child,
*25:20.960- 25:24.900* :  she wanted to become a nurse. But, as a wheelchair user,
*25:25.080- 25:30.040* :  she felt discriminated against after a family friend discouraged her from applying.
*25:30.040- 25:35.680* :  Because of the discrimination, I couldn't. Because I went there to get a form,
*25:35.840- 25:39.760* :  I was told I would not be able to do it. So, I felt bad.
*25:40.260- 25:45.140* :  Is it because of my disability? There can't become a nurse. I was sweeping.
*25:45.640- 25:50.320* :  So, my mom was consoling me because I felt people with disability, there's no life.
*25:50.700- 25:54.960* :  Because they cannot get to where they want to go. But, I say I have the ambitions.
*25:55.320- 25:58.120* :  I'm still going back for that notice. I was too good here.
*26:00.280- 26:02.460* :  With a nursing ambitions on the Bad Bonner,
*26:02.680- 26:05.800* :  her uncle introduced her to wheelchair power lifting,
*26:06.240- 26:10.660* :  and a sporting career with the very successful Nigerian team, Blasem.
*26:12.080- 26:16.020* :  But a route to sporting glory has not been easy. In 2013,
*26:16.020- 26:19.300* :  she was suspended for two years for a doping violation.
*26:19.300- 26:24.620* :  She maintains the band's substance was in a system because of medical care she received,
*26:25.020- 26:28.000* :  after being rushed to hospital following a miscarriage.
*26:28.940- 26:31.900* :  She then missed Rio 2016 because she was pregnant,
*26:32.060- 26:35.540* :  and says that two sons inspired a comeback for Tokyo.
*26:43.800- 26:46.120* :  And she isn't the only powerlifter in the family,
*26:46.480- 26:51.180* :  her all-spant to the upper Thai rule has also competed at two Paralympics.
*26:51.440- 26:52.560* :  All their women for me.
*26:52.980- 26:55.880* :  She impresses and inspires me. I am always proud of her.
*26:56.200- 27:00.980* :  And I boast that she is my wife. I always encourage her because sometimes,
*27:00.980- 27:06.480* :  when she lifts the weight and is discouraged, I always tell her you can't do it.
*27:06.840- 27:09.060* :  Wouldn't this made us? It means a lot to me.
*27:09.240- 27:14.360* :  It makes me feel among my other colleagues. I'm not feel discriminated.
*27:14.540- 27:17.260* :  So I feel I'm still more better than others.
*27:17.660- 27:18.760* :  As the everybody's.
*27:18.960- 27:21.820* :  I want to make Africa proud. Nigeria proud.
*27:22.340- 27:24.420* :  Myself and my family. I'm my fiducian.
*27:27.600- 27:29.500* :  Bola Shade, a Lua Fermiago,
*27:29.500- 27:33.260* :  talking to Isaiah Akinremi from BBC Sport Africa.
*27:34.060- 27:35.300* :  And staying in Nigeria,
*27:35.300- 27:40.060* :  Chidima Edit Shina, a former Miss South Africa contestant,
*27:40.380- 27:42.680* :  has been crowned Miss Universe Nigeria,
*27:42.680- 27:46.000* :  the 23-year-old who withdrew from the South Africa pageant,
*27:46.280- 27:50.080* :  amid controversy over her nationality, will now represent Nigeria
*27:50.080- 27:53.160* :  at the Miss Universe competition in Mexico this November,
*27:53.720- 27:54.860* :  Richard Cagui reports.
*28:13.720- 28:16.980* :  The probe found her mother committed fraud and identity theft
*28:17.360- 28:19.020* :  to obtain South Africa nationality.
*28:19.540- 28:21.320* :  After her story made headlines worldwide,
*28:21.320- 28:25.080* :  a dishina was invited to compete in the Nigerian beauty pageant.
*28:25.520- 28:29.560* :  A win comes off what has been a challenging few weeks for the law student.
*28:30.140- 28:30.960* :  Richard Cagui.
*28:31.480- 28:33.820* :  Now, just how close is too close?
*28:34.480- 28:36.520* :  This week, a seal conservation charity
*28:36.520- 28:41.360* :  wrote to the BBC apparently alarmed the actions of the seal whisperer,
*28:41.680- 28:43.860* :  a doctor who spends time with grey seals.
*28:44.520- 28:47.340* :  The charity is concerned that Dr Ben Burville's proximity
*28:47.340- 28:49.840* :  to the creatures might encourage other humans
*28:50.380- 28:52.240* :  to get too close to other seals.
*28:52.680- 28:55.040* :  Here's an extract from the BBC's seal whisperer.
*28:57.880- 29:01.360* :  Being with them in their world is just a magical experience.
*29:03.220- 29:05.620* :  Over the last 20 years, I've become an expert
*29:05.620- 29:07.140* :  in underwater seal behaviour.
*29:07.860- 29:10.780* :  Recording activity has never been seen before.
*29:11.900- 29:14.960* :  So where should the line be drawn between recording animals
*29:14.960- 29:16.560* :  and interacting with them?
*29:16.740- 29:18.760* :  Steve Backshall is a wildlife presenter
*29:18.760- 29:21.480* :  who's made a career of getting up close and personal
*29:21.480- 29:23.260* :  with a variety of wild animals.
*29:23.880- 29:26.880* :  I have so many memories of other wildlife presenters
*29:27.480- 29:30.840* :  interacting with wildlife in ways that triggered me towards
*29:31.280- 29:32.520* :  wanting to do this for a living.
*29:33.080- 29:35.760* :  I think one of the most potent was today with Attenborough
*29:35.760- 29:38.460* :  working in South Georgia with southern elephant seals.
*29:39.260- 29:42.060* :  And as he was trying to get his beaches to camera out,
*29:42.080- 29:45.340* :  these giant four-ton, five-ton elephant seals
*29:45.340- 29:47.080* :  were stampeding towards him.
*29:47.460- 29:49.760* :  And he appeared to be trying to bat them off with a broom hand.
*29:52.020- 29:53.960* :  All these are females.
*29:54.460- 29:58.080* :  They came ashore about a month ago to pup.
*29:58.740- 30:00.900* :  And now they're ready to breed together.
*30:01.400- 30:04.560* :  Which was one of those moments that makes you think
*30:05.240- 30:07.160* :  that is absolutely brilliant.
*30:07.160- 30:09.160* :  And that is exactly where I want to be in the future.
*30:09.360- 30:11.240* :  So deciding whether or not to interact with an animal
*30:11.240- 30:12.580* :  is a very complex thing.
*30:12.580- 30:15.020* :  And it's something that takes a huge amount of experience
*30:15.020- 30:17.600* :  and knowledge and years in the field.
*30:18.040- 30:19.800* :  Often you'll find, particularly in my job,
*30:19.840- 30:22.460* :  that if you can hang a little way away from them
*30:22.560- 30:24.080* :  and just go about your business,
*30:24.200- 30:25.720* :  like you're doing something interesting,
*30:25.720- 30:27.540* :  they're intelligent, they're interesting animals.
*30:27.540- 30:30.100* :  They may welcome and glance over your shoulder
*30:30.100- 30:31.340* :  and try and find out what you're doing.
*30:31.340- 30:32.720* :  And when that happens,
*30:33.440- 30:36.240* :  then something magical can happen after.
*30:36.620- 30:38.520* :  I would probably say that one of the proudest moments
*30:38.520- 30:41.840* :  of my entire career was interacting with seals.
*30:41.840- 30:44.720* :  Well, California sea lions during a live broadcast
*30:45.500- 30:47.440* :  of a program called Big Blue Live.
*30:48.140- 30:51.300* :  So we were diving in really dicey conditions,
*30:51.300- 30:53.180* :  completely life, beamed around the world.
*30:53.180- 30:56.000* :  And in this country, I think about six or seven million people
*30:56.600- 31:00.420* :  on lines to the surface in high sea state conditions.
*31:01.460- 31:04.240* :  And the water was filled with sea lions.
*31:06.060- 31:09.240* :  It isn't freely unbelievable spectacle.
*31:10.540- 31:13.040* :  We are at the brink of live broadcast rocks
*31:13.700- 31:17.040* :  and surrounded by California sea lions.
*31:17.620- 31:20.740* :  It was one of the diciest and most exciting things
*31:20.740- 31:22.440* :  that ever happened to me,
*31:22.440- 31:24.380* :  even more so, because every single thing
*31:24.380- 31:26.460* :  that I was doing on camera was being transmitted
*31:26.460- 31:29.300* :  from the surface by someone banging on the bottom of a boat
*31:29.580- 31:30.920* :  with a wrench, because that was the only way
*31:30.920- 31:32.440* :  they could communicate signals to me.
*31:33.480- 31:35.880* :  These bridges are completely transformed.
*31:37.140- 31:38.580* :  Here, they're underwater well.
*31:39.420- 31:42.680* :  They can appear to be clumsy when they're on land,
*31:42.680- 31:47.020* :  but here, they are agile, grateful,
*31:48.460- 31:49.720* :  and sit through the water.
*31:51.200- 31:52.800* :  And the bottom line is that if there's ever
*31:53.180- 31:54.620* :  any danger of stress to an animal
*31:54.620- 31:56.680* :  that you move away and you leave it well alone,
*31:56.680- 31:59.160* :  and that they have lots of ways of showing you that.
*31:59.180- 32:00.200* :  Depending on the animal group,
*32:00.200- 32:03.300* :  there will be various kinds of body language,
*32:03.920- 32:04.960* :  possibly verbal communication,
*32:04.980- 32:07.380* :  certainly ways that they will show you
*32:07.380- 32:10.500* :  whether they are accepting of you in their space or not.
*32:10.840- 32:12.460* :  And I think that with seals,
*32:12.460- 32:14.020* :  that is probably more pertinent
*32:14.020- 32:15.920* :  than with any other kind of animal.
*32:20.260- 32:24.140* :  Steve Baxchall, whose ocean UK series starts next month.
*32:27.280- 32:28.540* :  And that is all from us for now,
*32:28.540- 32:31.220* :  but the Global News podcast will be back very soon.
*32:31.220- 32:33.420* :  This edition was mixed by Tom Bartlett
