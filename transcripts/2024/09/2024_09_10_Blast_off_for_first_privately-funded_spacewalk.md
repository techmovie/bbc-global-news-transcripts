*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:12.560* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:16.080- 00:20.720* :  Hi everyone, my name is Natasha Rothwell and I'm here to tell you about my brand new show on Hulu
*00:20.720- 00:25.500* :  called How To Die Alone. I play the character of Melissa. She has no ambition, no love
*00:25.500- 00:31.940* :  life and no money, but what she does have is a reason to be the bad ass **** she was meant to be,
*00:31.940- 00:38.060* :  huh? I can't say ****. Okay, she has a reason to be the woman she was meant to be. You know what?
*00:38.060- 00:43.160* :  Just tell the bleep guy to stick around because I'm just getting **** started. Stream How To Die
*00:43.160- 00:48.460* :  Alone starting Friday September 13th on Hulu. Ryan Reynolds here for I guess my hundreds
*00:48.460- 00:53.680* :  mid commercial. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, honestly when I started this,
*00:53.680- 00:57.760* :  I thought I'd only have to do like four of these. I mean it's unlimited premium wireless for
*00:57.760- 01:02.600* :  $15 a month. How are there still people paying two or three times that much? I'm sorry,
*01:02.600- 01:08.300* :  I shouldn't be victim blaming here. Give it a try at midmobile.com slash switch, whatever you're ready.
*01:08.620- 01:13.040* :  $45 up from payment equivalent to $15 per month, new customers on first three month plan only,
*01:13.040- 01:15.880* :  taxes and fees extra, speed slower about 40 gigabytes, see details.
*01:19.020- 01:22.320* :  You're listening to the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.060- 01:30.380* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday the 10th of September.
*01:30.380- 01:34.040* :  A privately funded rocket has blasted off on a mission to carry out the first
*01:34.040- 01:40.040* :  spacewalk by civilian astronauts. The UN condemns a lethal Israeli air strike on a humanitarian
*01:40.040- 01:46.260* :  zone in Gaza and China's crackdown on corruption in football sees 43 people banned for life.
*01:49.460- 01:52.800* :  Also in the podcast, why has chocolate become so expensive?
*01:53.400- 02:00.180* :  It's also chocolate. What he's explaining here is that these are all small family farms.
*02:00.560- 02:04.700* :  They're not industrial processes at all and they're producing all this cocoa.
*02:05.460- 02:11.240* :  We visit farmers in the ivory coast and the row over the use of music in video games.
*02:17.060- 02:21.960* :  A privately funded space-ex mission has taken off from Florida with the aim of going further
*02:21.960- 02:25.440* :  from Earth than any man's craft for more than half a century.
*02:41.100- 02:46.660* :  If all goes to plan the Polaris Dorn mission, we'll feature the first ever privately funded
*02:46.660- 02:50.000* :  spacewalk as reflected in a message from mission control.
*02:50.580- 02:55.220* :  Dragon, SpaceX, today you embark on a journey not just of yourselves but for all humanity.
*02:55.720- 02:58.460* :  Each of you has trained tirelessly and prepared rigorously for this moment.
*02:58.780- 03:00.860* :  The moment where we reach higher than space never before.
*03:01.700- 03:05.880* :  As you gaze towards a star, remember that your courage lights the path for future explorers.
*03:06.100- 03:10.000* :  We trust your skills, your bravery, and your teamwork to carry out the mission that lies ahead.
*03:10.340- 03:13.200* :  Know that the entire team back here is with you every step.
*03:13.880- 03:15.200* :  Godspeed, Polaris Donkru.
*03:15.800- 03:17.140* :  May you make history and come home safely.
*03:17.880- 03:22.820* :  LDC, message received. We appreciate the kind words we want to be on this journey without
*03:23.240- 03:26.820* :  all 14,000 of you back at SpaceX and everyone else sharing a song.
*03:27.540- 03:28.460* :  We're going to get to work now.
*03:29.060- 03:34.180* :  Jared Isaacman, the American billionaire who is bankrolling and commanding the Polaris mission.
*03:34.700- 03:39.320* :  Our science correspondent, Palab Goesh, told me the crew of four is hoping to make history.
*03:40.000- 03:42.240* :  We know that the private sector have done a lot.
*03:42.280- 03:44.500* :  You've had billionaires going to space before.
*03:45.120- 03:50.620* :  SpaceX is now supplying and resupplying the space station with crew and astronauts,
*03:50.620- 03:56.000* :  but to date, they've just done the things that NASA has already been able to do,
*03:56.540- 04:01.420* :  perhaps slightly cheaper. But now, for the first time, they are going to do things that
*04:01.420- 04:06.440* :  NASA has not done before. You could think of it as a training wheels coming off,
*04:07.040- 04:10.520* :  and they're going to be doing ambitious things, things that have not been done before,
*04:10.520- 04:14.460* :  not just in this mission, but Isaacman has paid for three more.
*04:14.920- 04:19.760* :  So this doesn't mark a turning point in the role of the private sector in space.
*04:20.120- 04:21.960* :  Yeah, and tell us about this spacewalk.
*04:21.960- 04:23.680* :  It sounds like it could be quite complicated.
*04:24.800- 04:28.100* :  Well, there have been lots of spacewalks before,
*04:28.240- 04:32.420* :  but this is different because a dragon capsule does not have an airlock.
*04:32.420- 04:37.420* :  You'll know from your science fiction films that astronauts go into air locks.
*04:37.900- 04:43.440* :  The air is taken out of the airlock, but the rest of the crew have safely had their atmosphere
*04:43.440- 04:47.940* :  and they don't even need to have the helmets. They might have them on for a precaution.
*04:47.940- 04:53.480* :  Then the doorway opens to space, and the astronauts doing the spacewalk go outside.
*04:54.240- 04:59.760* :  Dragon does not have an airlock, so everyone is going to be exposed to the vacuum of space,
*05:00.340- 05:04.400* :  and the entire capsule is going to be exposed to the vacuum of space.
*05:04.960- 05:10.460* :  So can the capsule bear it? Can all four crew bear it for two hours?
*05:10.700- 05:15.000* :  This is the first time that it's been done before, so let's see what happens.
*05:15.060- 05:19.840* :  Another bit of jeopardy is that they'll be going through a region of space around the earth
*05:19.840- 05:23.160* :  called the Van Allen belts. That's higher in leveled in radiation.
*05:23.160- 05:26.160* :  They'll be safe, but it's higher than normal.
*05:26.160- 05:28.900* :  It's just kind of thing that astronauts will have to get used to
*05:29.420- 05:32.180* :  if they're going to take more long duration flights into space.
*05:32.740- 05:34.500* :  So what's the effect going to be on their bodies?
*05:35.020- 05:38.460* :  In all, there's 37 different experiments they're going to be carrying out
*05:38.820- 05:40.100* :  in this five-day mission.
*05:40.380- 05:44.860* :  Pushing the boundaries, I mean, if it's successful, is this just the start of a whole
*05:44.860- 05:46.640* :  range of private missions that we're going to see?
*05:47.020- 05:50.360* :  Well, in the bigger picture, it's up to the private sector,
*05:50.680- 05:55.080* :  not just to resupply the space station, but to help NASA get to the moon,
*05:55.080- 05:59.860* :  get to the moon again and again and again, and perhaps even go on to Mars.
*06:00.500- 06:04.920* :  NASA needs the private sector, world space agencies need the private sector
*06:05.380- 06:09.380* :  to make space affordable, and who knows, maybe our children will be
*06:09.580- 06:11.600* :  going to the moon Mars or beyond.
*06:12.180- 06:13.960* :  Our science correspondent Palab Gosh.
*06:15.160- 06:20.200* :  Throughout the 11 months of war between Israel and Hamas, people in Gaza have been forced
*06:20.200- 06:23.020* :  to move to different areas to try to escape the fighting.
*06:23.540- 06:27.360* :  The Israeli authorities have often directed them to so-called humanitarian zones,
*06:28.060- 06:29.560* :  but that doesn't mean they're safe.
*06:30.120- 06:34.960* :  Overnight, a missile attack hit a tented encampment at Al-Mawasi near Hanunis,
*06:35.340- 06:39.080* :  tearing huge craters and burying families under the sand.
*06:39.740- 06:42.980* :  The Hamas-Run Health Ministry says 19 people were killed.
*06:42.980- 06:44.640* :  This man described what happened.
*06:47.900- 06:52.700* :  I was sleeping and suddenly I found thick smoke in front of me,
*06:52.980- 06:55.220* :  and I couldn't see who was in front of me.
*06:55.220- 06:58.520* :  Without any warning, the bombing happened in seconds,
*06:58.520- 07:00.680* :  and we woke up and had to run.
*07:00.700- 07:04.300* :  The depth of the hole is 20 meters in the ground,
*07:04.300- 07:08.080* :  and the water came up from under the ground while we were sleeping.
*07:08.140- 07:10.800* :  I woke up to check on my children,
*07:10.800- 07:14.960* :  and I didn't see anything in front of me except a dead person here,
*07:14.960- 07:19.220* :  and another one buried there as a result of the fire from the missiles.
*07:19.260- 07:25.140* :  Israel has questioned the Hamas' casualty figures and said it had struck a Hamas command center.
*07:25.840- 07:29.660* :  Joe Floto, the BBC bureau chief in Jerusalem, told me more about the attack.
*07:30.280- 07:33.240* :  We had some accounts of witnesses who were there
*07:33.780- 07:38.200* :  in Al-Mawassi saying that they saw these huge fireballs go up into the night sky,
*07:39.020- 07:43.580* :  just around half past midnight, and those who ran to the scene were confronted with
*07:44.200- 07:48.460* :  some devastation of tents that were flattened and obliterated,
*07:48.920- 07:51.400* :  and some very large craters in the sand.
*07:51.400- 07:53.080* :  It's a largely sandy area.
*07:53.080- 07:56.240* :  This is an area of sand dunes close to the sea.
*07:56.240- 08:01.700* :  Now, the Israeli defence forces say that they use precision ammunition,
*08:01.760- 08:02.840* :  munitions rather.
*08:03.460- 08:07.060* :  They claim that they were going after significant Hamas members,
*08:07.060- 08:13.460* :  and they've listed three people who they say were part of senior members of the military side of Hamas.
*08:13.760- 08:19.080* :  Yeah, it's not the first time that Al-Mawassi has been targeted by the Israelis.
*08:19.080- 08:22.840* :  Tell us about the rules of targeting a humanitarian zone.
*08:23.280- 08:26.380* :  Israel has always said that humanitarian zone is where they will allow
*08:27.100- 08:29.520* :  international organisations and NGOs to accumulate
*08:30.440- 08:33.560* :  and warehouse a lot of humanitarian assistance,
*08:33.560- 08:37.680* :  and they've built some tent cities there and some field hospitals.
*08:37.680- 08:43.500* :  But Israel always says it will reserve the right to attack its enemies wherever they may be,
*08:43.500- 08:48.860* :  and they accuse Hamas of cynically hiding in those humanitarian areas
*08:49.280- 08:53.960* :  because deliberately in order to shield themselves from Israeli fire.
*08:54.160- 08:55.760* :  Now, for the people there,
*08:56.060- 08:59.520* :  where thousands of families are sheltered in Al-Mawassi,
*08:59.520- 09:02.080* :  and they've been displaced from other parts of Gaza,
*09:02.420- 09:04.060* :  it is a miserable existence.
*09:04.060- 09:07.780* :  They're living under Hamas or an improvised shelters
*09:08.160- 09:12.500* :  under the very, very strong sun of this time of year.
*09:13.120- 09:15.380* :  And for them, nowhere is safe.
*09:15.660- 09:20.500* :  So this kind of airstrike just increases the anxiety for those families
*09:20.500- 09:22.740* :  who are all desperate for this war to end, as you say,
*09:23.120- 09:24.520* :  entering its twelfth month now.
*09:25.040- 09:26.400* :  Jo Floto in Jerusalem.
*09:27.460- 09:31.080* :  When the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan three years ago,
*09:31.080- 09:35.800* :  they started rolling back the freedoms that women and girls had gained over the previous two decades.
*09:36.520- 09:38.200* :  Last month, they cracked down further,
*09:38.580- 09:42.320* :  banning women from speaking or showing their faces outside their homes.
*09:42.320- 09:47.220* :  Our correspondent, Yuga Tulumay, has been to Afghanistan to find out about the impact
*09:47.220- 09:51.220* :  of this harsh new edict, starting with a psychologist's perspective.
*09:52.640- 09:57.100* :  Most often, when I talk to friends, to my students, to colleagues,
*09:57.100- 10:01.460* :  there is no hope, and it's better to die than to live in this situation.
*10:01.660- 10:02.940* :  These are societal thoughts.
*10:03.140- 10:05.080* :  It's getting a lot and a lot day by day.
*10:06.060- 10:09.940* :  Every time these incremental restrictions on women have been announced in Afghanistan,
*10:09.940- 10:15.040* :  in the past, what we have seen is small groups of women marching on the streets,
*10:16.860- 10:20.520* :  shouting slogans, asking for the right to study and the right to work.
*10:20.520- 10:24.400* :  This time around, though, we have seen no demonstrations of those sort.
*10:25.060- 10:27.160* :  We know that Taliban has clamped down on them.
*10:28.060- 10:32.680* :  We've come to meet a woman who used to be a part of those protests.
*10:32.680- 10:37.980* :  She has to move houses every few weeks for her safety.
*10:37.980- 10:42.200* :  She asked for her voice to be changed so she wouldn't be identified.
*10:42.940- 10:47.060* :  I thought it was my duty to join the women who were protesting for our rights.
*10:47.780- 10:51.360* :  The Taliban beat me and dragged me into a vehicle saying,
*10:51.780- 10:53.340* :  why are you acting against us?
*10:54.000- 10:55.400* :  This is an Islamic system.
*10:56.180- 11:00.960* :  They took me to a dark, frightening place and insulted me with terrible words.
*11:01.840- 11:06.460* :  We were treated like animals, and that's why we couldn't continue protesting.
*11:07.220- 11:12.040* :  After being released from detention, we weren't the same people we were before.
*11:14.160- 11:15.820* :  She broke down as she spoke.
*11:18.500- 11:23.800* :  Now, Afghan women have been showing their dissent by posting videos of themselves online,
*11:24.500- 11:27.260* :  singing songs, criticizing the Taliban's actions.
*11:28.460- 11:31.060* :  I've come to the Taliban Government's Media Centre.
*11:31.440- 11:34.620* :  I'm here to meet the Taliban Government's Deputy spokesman,
*11:34.620- 11:38.360* :  Hamdullah Fitrat, and I'm going to ask him about the new law.
*11:38.800- 11:40.540* :  There are people in your own country.
*11:40.540- 11:43.000* :  There are even people who are working for your government
*11:43.000- 11:46.360* :  who say that your interpretation of the Sharia is wrong.
*11:46.820- 11:49.680* :  That the Sharia does not deny women basic rights.
*11:49.680- 11:54.320* :  How can you justify a law that doesn't allow their voices to be heard in public?
*11:57.280- 12:01.380* :  The laws that have been introduced have been approved by the Supreme Leader
*12:01.780- 12:03.640* :  in accordance with Islamic Sharia.
*12:04.280- 12:06.620* :  Any religious scholar can check their references.
*12:07.920- 12:12.480* :  Most of the girls and women we've spoken to in your country say they are prepared to wear
*12:12.480- 12:16.980* :  whatever it is that your government prescribes as long as you allow them to study.
*12:17.180- 12:19.100* :  And because they're not being allowed to do that,
*12:19.100- 12:22.660* :  they're being driven to the point of depression, even suicidal thoughts.
*12:23.440- 12:27.980* :  Isn't it your responsibility as a government to listen to those voices and act on it?
*12:28.120- 12:33.580* :  We'll call the, absolutely, our sister's education is an important issue.
*12:34.340- 12:38.440* :  We are trying to resolve this, which is the demand of a lot of our sisters.
*12:39.100- 12:41.720* :  We have mentioned it several times in the past, too,
*12:42.260- 12:46.140* :  that our leadership is working on it. A solution will be found.
*12:48.200- 12:51.000* :  It's been three years now since girls were locked out of schools.
*12:51.240- 12:54.540* :  Do you really expect people to believe that you are committed to actually doing it?
*12:55.020- 12:59.080* :  We are awaiting the decision of our leadership.
*13:01.760- 13:05.120* :  It's been evident for a long time that there are divisions within the Taliban
*13:05.120- 13:10.320* :  on the issue of women's education. And while for most women and teenage girls,
*13:10.320- 13:16.480* :  that means that they're blocked from getting an education, from college, from work of any sort.
*13:16.740- 13:22.160* :  During our visits to this country, we have often heard that there are pockets where
*13:22.940- 13:29.220* :  there are government run efforts to include women specifically in the public health sector.
*13:30.000- 13:35.340* :  I'm at a training course for midwives that run by the Taliban public health department
*13:35.420- 13:41.020* :  and all of the women in front of me. There are about a dozen of them.
*13:41.540- 13:44.600* :  All of them are young women who appear to be in their 20s.
*13:47.280- 13:51.300* :  My family feels proud of the work that I do. It gives me positive energy.
*13:52.000- 13:54.500* :  I'm happy to be able to serve the people of my country.
*13:54.760- 13:57.620* :  Twenty-seven-year-old Safiya Dolyans.
*13:59.280- 14:05.080* :  What I'm seeing in front of me, this is not likely to bring hope for a majority of women and
*14:05.080- 14:11.400* :  teenage girls. But it is perhaps evidence that there are people within the Taliban government
*14:12.280- 14:19.080* :  who are trying to facilitate and enable the exceptions to the stringent laws where it's possible.
*14:20.380- 14:22.660* :  You'll get a Lamai reporting from Afghanistan.
*14:23.960- 14:28.460* :  Football is one of China's most popular sports, but now the communist authorities
*14:28.460- 14:32.800* :  there are taking action on corruption. After a two-year investigation,
*14:32.800- 14:37.200* :  the regulator has placed lifetime bans on dozens of players and officials.
*14:37.260- 14:40.540* :  I Asia Pacific Editor Celia Hatton is following the story.
*14:40.980- 14:48.540* :  It's a big investigation. 43 people have been headed lifetime bans from football.
*14:48.620- 14:54.840* :  That includes a South Korean player, Sun Jun Ho, who was over in China playing for a Chinese
*14:54.840- 15:00.400* :  team. He was actually detained inside China for 10 months before being allowed to return to
*15:00.400- 15:06.280* :  South Korea earlier this year. The ban also includes two former Chinese national players,
*15:06.280- 15:12.280* :  a former national youth player. And the authorities say that this entire investigation has so far
*15:12.280- 15:21.520* :  netted 128 criminals. They've dismantled 12 online gambling gangs, identified 120 matches
*15:22.100- 15:28.720* :  affected by match fixing, involving everybody from referees to coaches to even club managers.
*15:28.720- 15:34.600* :  Now there's one team that's swirling around in all of this and that's the Shandong Taishan
*15:34.600- 15:40.040* :  football club. This is the club that actually won the Chinese Super League in 2021.
*15:40.060- 15:45.900* :  Quite a few people associated with that team are within that bigger group associated with this
*15:46.180- 15:50.380* :  corruption crackdown. So that team certainly isn't looking very good today.
*15:50.680- 15:55.700* :  Now I know the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, has been clamping down on corruption in business for
*15:55.700- 15:59.460* :  a long time. Is corruption in football a particular problem in China?
*16:00.000- 16:05.700* :  Yeah, and it really is embarrassing for the Chinese authorities because Xi Jinping is also a huge
*16:05.700- 16:12.580* :  football lover. So back in 2015, he said that he wanted the Chinese men's team. I should say
*16:12.580- 16:17.260* :  actually the Chinese women's team is a lot more successful and a lot cleaner than the men's side
*16:17.260- 16:23.400* :  of things, but he said he wanted the men's team to play in, to host, and to win a world cup.
*16:23.400- 16:29.240* :  And we are leagues away from that right now. So this ongoing corruption investigation in football
*16:29.240- 16:35.600* :  has been going on for a while and it's netted huge names. So we have Lee Tia. He's the former head coach
*16:35.600- 16:41.180* :  of the Chinese national team. He's confessed to bribery and he's awaiting sentencing.
*16:41.180- 16:47.080* :  And we also have the former chair of the Chinese Football Association. He's been handed a life
*16:47.080- 16:52.680* :  sentence in prison after he confessed to taking 11 million dollars in bribes.
*16:52.840- 16:55.280* :  Our Asia-Pacific Regional Editor, Celia Hatton.
*16:57.960- 16:59.900* :  And still to come on the global news podcast.
*17:00.480- 17:04.840* :  I think there's not many restrictions on what's posted, like TikTok and Instagram and stuff.
*17:04.980- 17:09.660* :  You can see some crazy things that kids should not see on those platforms, so I think that's good.
*17:10.180- 17:13.480* :  Australia's plan to keep children off social media.
*17:22.060- 17:28.580* :  This season, Instacart has your back to school. As in, they've got your back to school lunch
*17:28.580- 17:33.080* :  favorites like snack packs and fresh fruit. And they've got your back to school supplies,
*17:33.080- 17:40.380* :  like backpacks, binders and pencils. And they've got your back when your kid casually tells you
*17:40.380- 17:46.200* :  they have a huge school project to do tomorrow. Let's face it, we were all that kid.
*17:46.900- 17:53.020* :  So first, call your parents to say I'm sorry and then download the Instacart app to get
*17:53.020- 17:59.200* :  delivery in as fast as 30 minutes all school year long. Get a $0 delivery fee with your first
*17:59.200- 18:04.040* :  three orders while supplies last. Minimum $10 in order, additional term supply.
*18:04.740- 18:10.500* :  Ryan Reynolds here for, I guess, my hundredth mid commercial. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*18:11.040- 18:13.680* :  You know, honestly, when I started this, I thought I'd only have to do like four of these.
*18:13.860- 18:18.660* :  I mean, it's unlimited premium wireless for $15 a month. How are there still people paying
*18:18.660- 18:22.260* :  two or three times that much? I'm sorry, I shouldn't be victim blaming here.
*18:22.560- 18:26.720* :  Give it a try at midmobile.com slash switch, whatever you're ready.
*18:27.040- 18:31.460* :  $45 up from payment equivalent to $15 per month. New customers on first three month plan only.
*18:31.460- 18:34.300* :  Taxes and fees extra. Speed slower above 40 gigabyte, the seat details.
*18:39.640- 18:45.260* :  The killer and former boyfriend of Ugandan marathon runner Rebecca Cheptigay has died.
*18:45.260- 18:51.620* :  Dixon Diyama sustained serious burns when he attacked the Olympic athlete at her home 10 days ago.
*18:51.620- 18:54.860* :  A senior africa correspondent and soy has the details.
*18:55.500- 19:01.880* :  The hospital in the western city of Alderayt has confirmed that Dixon and Diyama,
*19:02.140- 19:06.580* :  the former boyfriend of Rebecca Cheptigay died last night.
*19:06.580- 19:11.340* :  He had been admitted. He was in intensive care after suffering 30% burns.
*19:11.420- 19:16.960* :  From that attack, he allegedly committed against his former girlfriend at her home.
*19:17.520- 19:22.900* :  It is alleged that they had an altercation. They'd been having a dispute over the ownership of
*19:23.380- 19:28.760* :  land and the estranged boyfriend apparently hid behind a chicken coop.
*19:28.880- 19:34.960* :  And when Cheptigay went there, he doused petrol on her and set her on fire.
*19:35.400- 19:41.160* :  She suffered 80% burns according to doctors and succumbed later in hospital.
*19:41.680- 19:46.380* :  It cast a spotlight on disturbing cases of femicide in Kenya.
*19:46.620- 19:50.360* :  Women who have died in the hands of their lovers.
*19:50.900- 19:57.260* :  We have had three athletes, at least three elite female athletes who have died
*19:57.260- 20:06.140* :  allegedly in the hands of their lovers or husband in the case of Agnes Tirol who died in 2021 here in Kenya as well.
*20:09.100- 20:14.020* :  Have you noticed your favourite chocolate bar getting more expensive or staying the same
*20:14.020- 20:19.200* :  price but becoming smaller, so-called shrink flation? There is a simple reason for this.
*20:19.200- 20:24.680* :  The price of cocoa, the vital ingredient in chocolate, has more than trebles in the past couple
*20:24.680- 20:30.080* :  of years. Some blame financial speculators, but there have also been problems affecting cocoa
*20:30.080- 20:34.580* :  growers as John Murphy reports now from the West African nation of Ivory Coast.
*20:38.320- 20:44.360* :  So that's the sound of two young men sitting on wooden seats getting through a pile of cocoa
*20:44.360- 20:52.420* :  beans. They spiked them with their machetes, cut them open and scoop out the seeds that are inside
*20:52.420- 20:58.140* :  which are white in colour. But the actual cocoa pods are yellows and greens and oranges and
*20:58.140- 21:05.660* :  reds. It's quite a pile. It's the first stage in a long journey towards transforming these
*21:05.660- 21:12.520* :  beans into many people's favourite confectionery, chocolate. Ivory Coast produces about 45 percent
*21:12.520- 21:18.980* :  of the world's cocoa. Our guide through this plantation is Imi Kui, president of the local co-operative.
*21:21.480- 21:27.700* :  What he's explaining here is that these are all small family farms. They're not industrial
*21:27.700- 21:35.520* :  processes at all. It's very small scale, pretty poor, obviously, and they're producing all this
*21:35.520- 21:42.200* :  cocoa. In Ivory Coast, the price farmers get for their cocoa is fixed by the authorities to smooth
*21:42.200- 21:49.400* :  over price fluctuations. This April, it was increased by 50 percent after the huge increases on
*21:49.400- 21:56.020* :  the international market. Now farmers are supposed to get about $2.50 per kilogram of dried brown
*21:56.020- 22:06.780* :  fermented cocoa. Many say it's not enough. There's no culture for chocolate here. We don't have the
*22:06.780- 22:13.460* :  culture of eating it. Dr Christian Cadio is from the University of San Pedro, a port city which is
*22:13.460- 22:19.860* :  the world's busiest in terms of cocoa exports. The Ivory government wants to transform the country's
*22:19.860- 22:27.900* :  cocoa industry, she says, and not just export the raw material. There are some small chocolate
*22:27.900- 22:33.980* :  solution units, but they tend to have little contracts with pharmacies, universities and small shops
*22:33.980- 22:40.100* :  because Ivoryans don't have this culture of consuming chocolate. The point is to try to add value
*22:40.100- 22:51.940* :  and not see it all go abroad. Back in the commercial capital Abyssal,
*22:52.020- 23:01.200* :  we're in Chukovy, one of Kudivwels' few chocolate makers. A bowl of chocolates has been brought out.
*23:01.200- 23:10.580* :  Natu. Natuure? Natuure? Casava. Casava, yeah. 95 percent cocoa this one.
*23:11.540- 23:17.200* :  Vivienne Kwame set up her small company three years ago. She caters for a middle-class market,
*23:17.200- 23:21.580* :  expatriates like diplomats and makes chocolate gifts for companies.
*23:21.580- 23:28.480* :  So, that's because during the course of the law, you said that running toward the brown
*23:28.500- 23:34.160* :  gold, we committed a lot of mistakes. Brown gold, I say it was known, yeah. Yeah, and we made a lot
*23:34.160- 23:40.860* :  of mistakes, but now we are working to improve things, including third trade and preventing the
*23:40.860- 23:47.420* :  frustration. So I think now we should be more positive and not being too much critical about it.
*23:48.100- 23:53.540* :  There is definitely some value to be extracted from Ivory Coast's brown gold. The question is
*23:53.540- 23:59.740* :  who gets it and whether those who actually grow it can benefit. That report by John Murphy.
*24:00.660- 24:05.580* :  Now, how do you stop children spending too much time on their mobile phones? Schools have tried
*24:05.580- 24:10.940* :  banning pupils from bringing phones into class while parents have attempted to put limits on
*24:10.940- 24:15.520* :  screen time. Now, Australia's Prime Minister is proposing a different approach,
*24:16.020- 24:20.900* :  Anthony Albanese wants to set a minimum age thought to be 16 before anyone is allowed
*24:20.900- 24:25.620* :  to use social media. These people in Melbourne had mixed feelings about the idea.
*24:26.380- 24:32.060* :  It sounds like an unnecessary overreach by the government. If people don't want their kids
*24:32.100- 24:36.820* :  to use social media, they should just not give them social media, not give them devices and ask them
*24:36.820- 24:40.680* :  not to use it. I don't think the federal government has been involved in banning that sort of thing.
*24:40.920- 24:45.620* :  Well, I think there's not many restrictions on what's posted. I'm ticked off on Instagram
*24:45.620- 24:51.260* :  and stuff. You can see some crazy things that kids should not see on those platforms,
*24:51.260- 24:54.880* :  so I think that's good. For more on this, Rob Young spoke to Faith Gordon,
*24:54.880- 25:00.020* :  professor in law at the Australian National University. Everyone will agree that something
*25:00.020- 25:05.020* :  does need to be done about the lack of accountability. For example, of social media companies,
*25:05.020- 25:10.760* :  this has been a big discussion for quite some time in Australia. But one key feature in all
*25:10.760- 25:15.920* :  of this at the moment is that we're hearing very little from children and young people themselves
*25:15.960- 25:21.840* :  on this issue. We really need to know what the government's proposals are about actually
*25:21.840- 25:29.240* :  how this would operate in reality. It's likely that a ban would be very difficult to implement.
*25:29.640- 25:34.960* :  When you've been conducting research in this area, is it your conclusion that when people
*25:34.960- 25:42.040* :  under the age of 15, for example, go on social media, it is just on balance a negative experience
*25:42.040- 25:47.960* :  for them, that it is worth just making sure they can't go on? Those of us that do research directly
*25:47.960- 25:53.720* :  with children and young people will hear about the negative, but also the positive
*25:54.380- 26:00.860* :  insights of social media. Many children and young people that I've spoken to as part of my research
*26:00.860- 26:07.900* :  have identified the online spaces provide them with a sense of community and a sense of belonging.
*26:07.900- 26:15.840* :  Particularly, I have found children and young people who identify as being part of the LGBTQI
*26:15.840- 26:21.660* :  plus community have highlighted that sometimes that's the only sense of belonging and community
*26:21.660- 26:28.180* :  is find online. We need to be really careful that we're not cutting children and young people off
*26:28.180- 26:35.440* :  from a source of information, whether it be on health or other aspects that they're exploring
*26:35.440- 26:42.820* :  at the moment. We really need to be aware that there are many positive benefits.
*26:42.820- 26:48.760* :  Children and young people are digital natives, technology as it's evolving is going to be very
*26:48.760- 26:55.780* :  much part of their future. Education, as well, is at the core and children and young people make
*26:55.780- 27:03.120* :  many suggestions about how the adults in their lives as well as their peer group should be
*27:03.120- 27:09.740* :  receiving education and they want to see that much more layered and designed by young people
*27:09.740- 27:21.740* :  themselves. This proposal, we need to be careful about excluding children from spaces where they
*27:21.740- 27:26.200* :  actually report as having a sense of belonging and need for those spaces.
*27:27.000- 27:31.420* :  Prath Gordon talking to Rob Yo. Next to a 1980s classic.
*27:43.860- 27:49.820* :  Well, that is temptation by Heaven 17 and it's at the centre of a row over how much video
*27:49.820- 27:56.320* :  games makers should pay for music. The song's co-writer Martin Ware said he was outraged by a
*27:56.320- 28:02.000* :  low offer from rock star games, which is due to release its grand theft autosix next year.
*28:02.760- 28:07.300* :  It's highlighted the debate over whether artists are being ripped off or given an opportunity to
*28:07.300- 28:11.720* :  reach new audiences via video games, as I heard from the BBC's Jasmine Sandar.
*28:12.280- 28:17.020* :  Essentially, this is just a dispute between music artists and gaming companies and a lot of
*28:17.020- 28:21.140* :  music artists are getting really frustrated and upset when they're seeing that the money they're
*28:21.140- 28:26.080* :  being offered or the royalties that they're making from the music are so disproportionately low
*28:26.080- 28:31.080* :  in comparison to how much game developers and gaming companies are making from their products.
*28:31.580- 28:38.520* :  And how has Martin Ware reacted to all this? Well, he expressed his fury on X as quite an
*28:38.520- 28:43.840* :  inflammatory post. He said he was excited when he received the email and when he scrolled to the
*28:43.840- 28:48.520* :  bottom of the email and saw the offer of only seven and a half thousand dollars, he was very
*28:48.520- 28:53.940* :  annoyed at that, especially in comparison to how much grand theft autosix grossed, which was around
*28:53.940- 28:58.780* :  8.6 billion, and he ended his post with a few exclusives as well, which I don't think are very
*28:58.780- 29:04.240* :  radio friendly. Yeah, I suppose it's difficult to measure the impact of music on a game's revenue.
*29:04.520- 29:09.360* :  How have rock star games responded to this current rail? We have contacted rock star games
*29:09.360- 29:14.440* :  to comment that we've not heard back from them yet. In the meantime, we've spoken to the Musician's
*29:14.440- 29:19.240* :  Union and Naomi Paul, who's the General Secretary of the Union told us that the fee offer to Martin
*29:19.240- 29:24.360* :  does actually look really low. She said that they would expect there to be tens of thousands to be
*29:24.360- 29:30.300* :  paid for the master and also tens of thousands to be paid for the publisher potentially as well.
*29:30.300- 29:37.120* :  The BBC's Jasmine Sander. Now this time tomorrow will be digesting the aftermath of the US
*29:37.120- 29:42.500* :  presidential election debate. The vote itself is in eight weeks time, and ahead of the poll will
*29:42.500- 29:48.140* :  be doing a special podcast in collaboration with our friends at America's. So if you have any
*29:48.140- 29:52.940* :  questions you want answered about the election, then please send them in. You can email global
*29:52.940- 30:00.580* :  podcast at bbc.co.uk or tweet us at global news pod. And if possible, please record your question
*30:00.580- 30:02.220* :  in a voice note. Thank you.
*30:05.240- 30:09.720* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the global news podcast very soon.
*30:09.820- 30:14.460* :  This one was mixed by Chris Lovelock and produced by Stephanie Zacherson, our editors,
*30:14.460- 30:17.560* :  Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
*30:26.740- 30:31.340* :  Hi, everyone. My name is Natasha Rothwell, and I'm here to tell you about my brand new show on Hulu
*30:31.340- 30:36.120* :  called How to Die Alone. I play the character of Melissa. She has no ambition, no love
*30:36.120- 30:42.580* :  life, and no money, but what she does have is a reason to be the bad ass b****. She was meant to be,
*30:42.580- 30:48.700* :  huh? I can't say okay. She has a reason to be the woman she was meant to be. You know what?
*30:48.700- 30:54.000* :  Just tell the bleep guy to stick around because I'm just getting started. Stream How to Die Alone,
*30:54.000- 30:59.800* :  starting Friday, September 13th on Hulu. Good taste is easy to spot, but hard to pin down.
*30:59.800- 31:04.860* :  You know it when you see it. And in today's culture, there's no greater signifier of taste
*31:04.860- 31:09.820* :  than the car you drive. You want something is sophisticated, but not stodgy,
*31:10.120- 31:16.300* :  daring, yet classic, approachable, but with an air of opulence. That's where the Range Rover
*31:16.300- 31:21.660* :  evoke comes in. The reductive exterior is an elegant expression of Range Rover DNA,
*31:21.660- 31:27.620* :  and the chiseled taillight graphics give the evoke a sense of motion even at standstill.
*31:28.280- 31:32.780* :  Explore the Range Rover evoke at LandRoverUSA.com.
