*01:25.860- 01:29.100* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Wednesday,
*01:29.100- 01:33.800* :  the 4th of September. The Ukrainian president has vowed revenge for a missile strike on a
*01:33.800- 01:39.080* :  military academy that killed more than 50 people. A former aide to the governor of New York has been
*01:39.080- 01:44.180* :  charged with acting as an agent for China. And France has called for a new migration agreement with
*01:44.180- 01:48.000* :  Britain after 12 people died trying to cross the channel by boat.
*01:48.420- 01:57.980* :  Also in the podcast, 800,000 children in this country know the name of Nicklaus Wynton.
*01:58.360- 02:02.360* :  I hope, you know, in another 100 years, people will know who Nicklaus Wynton was.
*02:03.000- 02:08.900* :  Prague honors the man who rescued hundreds of Jewish children from Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia.
*02:14.020- 02:18.260* :  But we begin with an update on that breaking news that came in as we recorded our earlier
*02:18.260- 02:22.940* :  podcast, a Russian missile attack on the central city of Portava, many kilometers from the
*02:22.940- 02:28.980* :  front line. The Ukrainian authorities now say more than 50 people died and more than 200 were injured
*02:28.980- 02:34.720* :  when two ballistic missiles hit a military academy and nearby hospital. Service personnel were
*02:34.720- 02:39.960* :  among those killed and investigation is underway and it claims an outdoor ceremony had been targeted.
*02:39.980- 02:45.780* :  It's one of the deadliest attacks in two and a half years of war and president Zelensky vowed to
*02:45.780- 02:51.280* :  hold, quote, Russian scum to account. These residents described the moment the missile struck.
*02:55.960- 03:00.640* :  The air raid alert started in just a minute and then there were two explosions and we thought
*03:00.640- 03:05.240* :  it was somewhere on our house. Then we got ready to go outside and realized that it was the
*03:05.240- 03:10.860* :  communications institute. At home, we immediately ran into the bathroom with the child but then
*03:10.860- 03:15.920* :  gathered ourselves. On this side, all the windows were smashed in the entrance and in the neighbor's
*03:15.920- 03:23.520* :  house. We were at home at the time. It was nine in the morning and there were two very strong
*03:23.520- 03:29.060* :  explosions. We were very scared. We quickly ran to the bathroom because it was really scary.
*03:29.340- 03:35.080* :  Fortunately, nothing knocked us out but there is a house nearby. Everything was blown out,
*03:35.080- 03:40.320* :  all the windows. We don't have a basement in our house so our only option was to sit there.
*03:41.040- 03:46.520* :  I got an update from our correspondent at the scene Nick Beak. Oliver, we're just outside this
*03:46.540- 03:51.520* :  particular location that was hit so devastatingly earlier today. At the moment, I can see the
*03:51.520- 03:57.520* :  emergency services working in the dark, fire teams going through the rubble. You might every now
*03:57.520- 04:01.800* :  and then be able to hear the periodic crash of debris being thrown out of the window as they
*04:01.800- 04:07.080* :  try and clear buildings. Just looking up at these buildings, there's hardly any windows in them
*04:07.080- 04:11.260* :  that are not broken that haven't been blown out and that gives you an indication of this blast.
*04:11.300- 04:16.320* :  It really was huge. As well as the emergency workers, you've got lots of Ukrainians soldiers
*04:16.320- 04:21.860* :  around here. We can't get particularly near because of the sensitivity of this site. The fact
*04:21.860- 04:28.640* :  it was a military location and there was training done here. A devastating strike and some questions
*04:28.640- 04:34.240* :  about the possibility of lack security, how this was allowed to happen. The military have been
*04:34.240- 04:39.600* :  talking about the utmost importance of protecting life and then protecting people who are serving
*04:40.020- 04:44.240* :  their country. I mean, it's worth stressing that this is a city which, although like so many other
*04:44.240- 04:50.320* :  places in Ukraine, has experienced missiles, has experienced regular air raid alerts but it is very
*04:50.320- 04:56.460* :  far from the front line, not far though, clearly from the range of Russian missiles which hit with
*04:56.460- 05:02.440* :  devastating impact. I'm just looking actually at a few more firefighters going towards the building
*05:02.440- 05:08.620* :  or what remains of the building. We heard earlier that people were under the rubble, not clear whether
*05:08.620- 05:13.260* :  they'd been located was still alive and could be moved out or whether in fact they had died and
*05:13.260- 05:17.920* :  were unaccounted for but certainly the emergency services will be staying here for a long time
*05:17.920- 05:24.500* :  because of the huge impact of this. And how does this fit into the wider conflict? It's south
*05:24.500- 05:31.220* :  of Kursk where the Ukrainians were on the advance and west of Donbas where the Russians are pushing
*05:31.220- 05:36.820* :  forward. Well, it's central Ukraine and you could say it's both literally and figuratively right
*05:36.820- 05:41.400* :  in the middle of this conflict because it's got nothing directly to do with those two parts of
*05:41.400- 05:46.600* :  the ongoing war that you mentioned but it is somewhere which along with other towns and cities
*05:46.600- 05:53.020* :  have been hit time and again by Russian missiles and this reign of terror as President Zelensky
*05:53.460- 05:58.200* :  continues to call it. He said the Russians were scum today and said in light of what he saw
*05:58.780- 06:05.360* :  happen in this city, the western world, western partners, those in NATO need to do much more to
*06:05.360- 06:11.400* :  help protect Ukraine from strikes like this in the future. Nick Beak in Poltava will Yuri Sack as
*06:11.400- 06:16.640* :  a senior advisor to the Ukrainian government. What was his reaction to the attack? Of course the
*06:16.640- 06:22.900* :  first initial reaction is shock despite the two and a half years of this war and despite the fact
*06:22.900- 06:28.260* :  that one might think that people of Ukraine would be used to these kind of tragedies by now but
*06:28.260- 06:33.200* :  every time something like this happens, it is if it is happening for the first time. So lots of
*06:33.200- 06:40.060* :  casualties, another terrorist attack by a terrorist state and the world is standing by and not giving
*06:40.060- 06:45.700* :  us the permission to use the long-range weapons. These missiles came from more than 400 kilometers
*06:45.700- 06:50.920* :  away we understand. How come people didn't get any significant warning of the strikes?
*06:52.420- 07:00.460* :  Well in fact the investigation into what exactly happened is ongoing and what we have had confirmed
*07:00.460- 07:05.900* :  by the Office of the General Prosecutor by now that the air aid siren was on, a lot of actually
*07:05.900- 07:11.900* :  people who were there, they did manage to seek shelter in a bomb shelter but of course there were
*07:11.900- 07:18.940* :  those who didn't respond appropriately to the air aid siren and hence we have such considerable
*07:18.940- 07:24.800* :  numbers of casualties. What about the target today in Poltava? It was a military one, wasn't it?
*07:25.860- 07:33.600* :  It was a military university where young cadets have been present to almost celebrate the
*07:33.600- 07:40.000* :  beginning of the academic year so it was an educational facility, it wasn't a military facility and
*07:40.000- 07:45.760* :  in addition to that of course we have to say that this was a double tap attack by the Russian
*07:45.820- 07:51.980* :  terrorist state which means that after the first missile that hit the educational facility the second
*07:51.980- 07:58.560* :  one came and it also hit the hospital nearby. Ukraine has constantly asked as you are asking now
*07:58.560- 08:04.960* :  to be given free reign to hit targets further afield and notably inside Russia but this attack came
*08:04.960- 08:13.260* :  from Crimea, surely Ukraine has the green light to hit targets there. Well I think we still our
*08:13.660- 08:17.800* :  general staff and our military leadership has not confirmed yet where exactly this attack came
*08:17.800- 08:23.460* :  from. What we keep saying that there are more than 200 targets inside the Russian territory
*08:23.460- 08:30.860* :  just in the months of August we were the target of almost 1,000 missiles of different kinds.
*08:30.860- 08:36.040* :  Some of them are launched at Ukraine from the Crimean launch pad, some of them are launched from
*08:36.040- 08:41.820* :  the Russian territory, the Kursk region, Belgrade region, Bransk region. So the more we degrade
*08:41.820- 08:47.140* :  the Russian army, the more we degrade the ability to strike us, of course the safer will be our
*08:47.140- 08:56.660* :  people, the sooner we will be able to reach some peace. When Poland and Israel moved to impose
*08:56.660- 09:02.700* :  reforms on their legal systems they faced huge protests and accusations of creeping authoritarianism
*09:03.120- 09:08.720* :  is Mexico now going the same way. Well before President Andres Manuel Lopez obrador
*09:08.720- 09:13.960* :  hands over to his successor next month he's trying to push through changes that will see judges
*09:13.960- 09:20.120* :  elected by a popular vote. Last month judicial workers began an indefinite strike over the
*09:20.120- 09:25.440* :  plans and on Tuesday demonstrators blocked the entrance to Congress as lawmakers were about to
*09:25.440- 09:30.300* :  begin debating the matter, forcing them to move to an alternative venue as I heard from our
*09:30.300- 09:36.480* :  Mexico correspondent Will Grant. The event is going ahead in the Magdalena Mixhulka sports
*09:36.480- 09:42.080* :  complex that was used in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico. It is a reasonably short distance from
*09:42.080- 09:47.120* :  the legislative palace and that's because as you said the entrance to the Congress building
*09:47.120- 09:54.200* :  would be blocked by law students, by those striking workers from the legal system and also people
*09:54.200- 09:59.720* :  were working for the supreme court have gone on strike as well. So there was quite a number of people
*09:59.720- 10:05.880* :  they were going to make it very very difficult as well as those deputies who opposed this reform.
*10:06.340- 10:11.060* :  So the decision of the governing coalition has been to move venue altogether.
*10:11.720- 10:14.500* :  Yeah does it seem likely they'll be able to stop this reform?
*10:15.300- 10:20.660* :  It doesn't to be perfectly honest. All the theatre to one side of changing venues and so on.
*10:20.660- 10:26.540* :  The truth is this is President Andrews Manuel Lopez obrador's brainchild. He wants to see it go
*10:26.540- 10:32.900* :  through. He's convinced it's necessary for a root and branch reform of the judicial system in
*10:32.900- 10:38.780* :  Mexico which he says is corrupt is no longer fit for purpose is infiltrated by organized crime.
*10:39.220- 10:45.180* :  And when he says that he wants that with the supermajority that they have in the houses of Parliament
*10:45.520- 10:51.000* :  it is going to be extremely difficult for any group blocking this to actually be able to prevent
*10:51.000- 10:56.560* :  it going through. But there's not just criticism inside Mexico. The US isn't happy about it.
*10:58.080- 11:02.360* :  No definitely not. You can tell that Washington isn't impressed at all with this reform.
*11:02.860- 11:07.200* :  Their belief is that it undermines democracy. The US Ambassador Ken Salasad
*11:07.400- 11:12.680* :  said that to Mexico's democracy faced a major risk recently which was a clear reference
*11:13.140- 11:19.300* :  to the President's plan to reform this system. Allow voters to pick judges. That would be 7,000
*11:19.300- 11:24.180* :  judges who would be up for votes sometimes next year and then again a couple of years later.
*11:24.740- 11:29.700* :  Nevertheless Mr Lopez obrador doesn't tend to listen too closely to that kind of criticism.
*11:29.700- 11:34.740* :  He's very much of the belief that that's interference in national affairs shouldn't take place.
*11:34.740- 11:39.900* :  And that he is there to do the will of the Mexican people and this was always on his agenda.
*11:40.300- 11:44.060* :  And with this indefinite strike is the justice system able to function?
*11:45.620- 11:49.240* :  It's pretty snowed up as you can imagine at least during this period.
*11:50.080- 11:53.880* :  We will see how long it goes on. It's going to be interesting to see that the Supreme Court itself
*11:53.980- 11:59.880* :  goes on strike and one wonders exactly what the effects will be there on the running of the nation
*11:59.880- 12:05.020* :  as well. It is significant and I think symbolically it's significant as well. It's saying
*12:05.020- 12:09.220* :  you know from the Lopez obrador side and this is the will of the people because the judicial
*12:09.220- 12:13.780* :  system isn't fit for purpose while those who actually work in the judicial system saying we don't
*12:13.780- 12:19.480* :  want this this undermines democracy and it's going to basically politicize the judiciary and make
*12:19.480- 12:25.460* :  it another branch of the executive. Our Mexico correspondent Will Grant, a former aid to the New
*12:25.460- 12:30.540* :  York Governor Kathy Hockle has been arrested and charged with being an undisclosed agent of the
*12:30.540- 12:36.460* :  Chinese government. Linda Sun and her husband Chris Who were arrested at their home on Long Island
*12:36.460- 12:41.720* :  on Tuesday. Miss Sun pleaded not guilty and was released on a one and a half million dollar bond.
*12:41.720- 12:47.540* :  The details from Nettael freak in New York. Prosecutors alleged that Linda Sun followed orders and
*12:47.540- 12:53.100* :  directions from the Chinese government to advance Beijing's political interests. Miss Sun
*12:53.100- 12:58.800* :  is accused of shaping the governor's private phone calls and official public statements to conform
*12:58.800- 13:04.420* :  with the expectations of representatives of the Chinese consulate. It's also alleged that she
*13:04.420- 13:09.320* :  blocked representatives of the Taiwanese government from having access to the governor's office.
*13:09.580- 13:14.480* :  In exchange it's alleged that she and her husband received economic and other benefits.
*13:14.540- 13:20.160* :  Prosecutors say the couple laundered the monetary proceeds to purchase New York real estate were
*13:20.160- 13:28.840* :  $3.6 million. Nettael freak. And still to come on the global news podcast. How many more

*14:56.320- 15:01.360* :  It is an extremely dangerous journey but despite the efforts of the British and French governments
*15:01.360- 15:04.860* :  migrants are still determined to try to cross the English channel.
*15:04.860- 15:09.880* :  The French authorities say at least 12 people died on Tuesday when their boat capsized.
*15:10.500- 15:15.040* :  It is the deadliest disaster in the channel this year and has prompted France to call for a new
*15:15.040- 15:19.380* :  migration treaty with Britain. Our Paris correspondent Hugh Scofield reports.
*15:19.760- 15:25.260* :  Insadly now familiar circumstances the boat carrying around 60 people across the channel proved
*15:25.260- 15:30.760* :  unfit for the task. The rubber launch began breaking up and by the time rescue vessels were at the scene
*15:31.180- 15:35.360* :  all those who'd been on board were in the water. In a major operation they were brought to
*15:35.360- 15:41.560* :  shore by boat and helicopter. Just outside Belon's Shomer an emergency centre was set up to provide
*15:41.560- 15:45.640* :  medical treatment for those less badly injured. Others were taken to hospital.
*15:45.660- 15:51.260* :  France's interior minister Gerald Damanar came to Belon to offer condolences to the bereaved
*15:51.540- 15:55.120* :  and thanks to the emergency services. Today they are two of the people of the
*15:58.580- 16:02.700* :  Africa. Today those affected by this tragedy are people from the horn of Africa who are trying
*16:02.700- 16:07.080* :  to join their families or work in conditions that are not acceptable in France. It is important
*16:07.080- 16:11.780* :  to reestablish a standard migratory relationship with our neighbours and friends in Great Britain.
*16:12.280- 16:17.020* :  Otherwise despite the efforts of police we will not be able to stop these issues affecting
*16:17.020- 16:22.920* :  northern France. This is the most serious incident in the channel this year and brings the overall
*16:22.920- 16:29.600* :  number of deaths in January to nearly 40, a big increase on 2023. Friends officials blame the rising
*16:29.600- 16:35.660* :  toll on unscrupulous traffickers cramming too many people on boats that are clearly unseeworthy.
*16:36.100- 16:40.720* :  You Scofield in Paris. Well the issue of migration has been highlighted in an unusual
*16:40.720- 16:46.520* :  art exhibition in London. The city's subway system features art on the underground at tube stations
*16:46.520- 16:52.380* :  and the latest offering is called a Taste of Home by the British photographic artist Joy Gregory.
*16:52.380- 16:57.620* :  It's just been unveiled at one of the busiest gateways into Britain. Penny Dale went to Heathrow
*16:57.620- 17:05.620* :  Terminal 4 to find out more. We are now arriving at Heathrow Terminal 4 when this train terminates.
*17:09.280- 17:16.820* :  If you look up and around in this concrete ticket hall you'll see a series of prints of fragments
*17:16.820- 17:24.820* :  in different shades of blue. Some have words on them. An ancient woman who has lived all seasons
*17:24.820- 17:31.040* :  wonders the earth gathering camomile. I think they are quite special. It's like maybe try any
*17:31.040- 17:36.520* :  tradition like tie dye. That's quite welcoming really. As people we can commonly connect through
*17:36.520- 17:41.420* :  food and I think that's a really nice way of showcasing that even though we are from very diverse
*17:41.420- 17:46.120* :  backgrounds there are some commonalities. Well we'll go somewhere quite a joy huh? Yeah okay.
*17:47.100- 17:53.840* :  Joy Gregory has created 24 images of plants. She's weaved in the names of herbs and spices like
*17:53.840- 18:00.660* :  cardanum, caraway seeds and pimento as well as some lines from two poems. There's one that's
*18:00.660- 18:07.400* :  sort of like all these blue leaves that are two different colors of blue that sort of wind round.
*18:07.660- 18:11.360* :  They remind me of veins. They make me think of humans and they also make me think of thought
*18:11.360- 18:15.960* :  and feeling and that's the thing that makes you feel quite emotional along with the poetry
*18:16.640- 18:21.280* :  that there's one about home. No one leaves home unless the home is the mouth of a shark.
*18:22.200- 18:26.460* :  And that is very true. That is very true because you have to save your life and you will then
*18:26.820- 18:28.120* :  try to do whatever.
*18:30.100- 18:36.040* :  Usman Hallead runs the Haven coffee shop in northeast London. He trains refugees and he
*18:36.040- 18:42.320* :  organizes comedy nights and art exhibitions as a way of challenging misconceptions about asylum
*18:42.320- 18:51.500* :  seekers. He left Pakistan in 2007. For freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of thoughts, freedom of
*18:51.500- 18:57.720* :  what I want to decide for myself on the basis of religion. People from all over the world have been
*18:57.720- 19:03.620* :  coming to Britain for centuries to work in the cotton mills during the 18th century industrial
*19:03.620- 19:10.100* :  revolution in hospitals after the Second World War and to escape oppression and conflict in
*19:10.100- 19:16.060* :  their own countries. But as Joy Gregory says, people are not always made to feel welcome.
*19:16.600- 19:25.360* :  We've had many years of rhetoric around migrants being a negative thing within our spaces.
*19:25.360- 19:31.380* :  People think about, you know, people coming for asylum as having no skills and no knowledge and
*19:31.380- 19:37.320* :  no training. I think in ten years time we'll be inviting people to come and stay because we need
*19:37.320- 19:42.220* :  people. Like my parents were invited to come from Jamaica to come and help build the country
*19:42.220- 19:48.500* :  after the war. We're all migrants in some sort of way. A taste of home came out of some art workshops
*19:48.500- 19:55.180* :  Joy Gregory held for about a hundred people who are seeking asylum in Britain. Her inspiration
*19:55.180- 20:00.580* :  came from the fact that there are no facilities at their temporary accommodation to cook a meal
*20:00.580- 20:08.560* :  from scratch. Instead, there are just microwave meals. Mac could be your fate for maybe five years
*20:08.560- 20:13.560* :  while you're waiting for your case to be heard and I just think cooking and food is the thing that
*20:13.560- 20:18.140* :  makes it feel like a whole person. If you're feeling homesick, you'll find yourself something
*20:18.140- 20:22.880* :  that reminds you of the home and the spices are the things that actually make you think of
*20:22.880- 20:29.120* :  home because they're the particular flavours that you add to your food. That report by Penny Dale.
*20:29.460- 20:35.180* :  The main opposition party in Uganda says its leader Bobby Wein has been shot in the leg and
*20:35.180- 20:40.660* :  seriously injured by security agents in the capital campala. Bobby Wein has emerged as the strongest
*20:40.660- 20:46.080* :  rival and a thorn in the side of Uganda's long-term president you're wearing a 70. I heard more
*20:46.080- 20:50.960* :  from the journalist Solomon Sir Wanger who is in campala. So what we know for now Bobby Wein
*20:50.960- 20:58.700* :  has been receiving healthcare at one of the national hospitals in campala. We cannot absolutely
*20:58.700- 21:06.380* :  verify without a doubt that he was shot. However, what we know because I was on the ground,
*21:06.380- 21:14.900* :  he sustained a major injury after a scuffle between his voters and the police. What we know also
*21:14.900- 21:21.660* :  is that Bobby Wein was attending a Thanksgiving ceremony for his friend after which he stopped
*21:21.660- 21:28.140* :  along the roadside and tried to speak to his supporters. The police refused and asked him to
*21:28.140- 21:33.620* :  get back into the van and driveway and that's how the scuffer ensued and during the process,
*21:33.620- 21:38.720* :  you know, tear gas was fired. People were throwing stones at the police. There was a scuffle and
*21:38.720- 21:45.220* :  during that scuffle, he sustained an injury. However, I need to add and emphasize that we absolutely
*21:45.220- 21:52.380* :  cannot verify that it was a gun shot. What we know for sure, he sustained an injury and is
*21:52.380- 21:58.100* :  receiving medical care at a hospital in campala. Okay, but there definitely was a confrontation
*21:58.100- 22:02.680* :  and just reminders of how the authorities have treated Bobby Wein in the past.
*22:03.300- 22:09.280* :  Certainly, Robert Chagulanio, Bobby Wein is currently the biggest opposition leader in Uganda
*22:10.020- 22:15.700* :  and, of course, he has given a blood in us to President Yoram Seveni in terms of the political
*22:15.700- 22:22.460* :  warfare, if I can say. Bobby Wein has come out to challenge human rights violations, illegal
*22:22.460- 22:30.020* :  detention, arbitrary arrests and he has been indeed been arrested in the past by military
*22:30.060- 22:36.460* :  officers. His campaigns have been mad by violence. It's needless to say that a number of people have
*22:36.460- 22:42.600* :  died belonging to the National Interplatform Political Party. He certainly has faced the brunt
*22:43.040- 22:50.040* :  of the incumbent President Yoram Seveni. Solomon Sawanger in the Ugandan capital campala.
*22:50.700- 22:56.000* :  Now, here's a question. How many toilets do you really need in a home? Kevin McLeod,
*22:56.000- 23:00.760* :  presenter of a TV show about dream dwellings, has sparked a debate among property designers
*23:01.380- 23:07.120* :  by saying he's annoyed by the over-provision of toilets. That is, houses with more toilets than
*23:07.120- 23:12.020* :  physical occupants. The BBC Sarah Montague asked him why he's so exercised about it.
*23:12.500- 23:16.660* :  If you look at the history of toilets than the flushing toilets, it's been a five hundred
*23:16.660- 23:23.620* :  years slow march. So John Harrington installed a flushing toilet for Queen Elizabeth I in the
*23:23.620- 23:29.920* :  1570s or something. And I once rode a stage show really principally around this, the history of
*23:29.920- 23:34.400* :  the toilet, because I've always found it fascinating how drains are at the very foundation
*23:34.400- 23:39.880* :  literally of our civilization. No drains within cities, cholera breaks out within days.
*23:39.880- 23:44.560* :  So I think there's a very strong historical kind of narrative here, which seems to have
*23:44.560- 23:51.000* :  accelerated very alarmingly in the last 20 years. The ensuite bathroom is sort of everybody
*23:51.000- 23:55.300* :  would love a non-sweet bathroom. That's understandable, isn't it? If you're building your dream
*23:55.300- 24:03.220* :  home. Yes indeed. And I think all of the research demonstrates that adding an on suite can add
*24:03.220- 24:09.360* :  up to 7% to the value of your home. So thereafter, how many more bathrooms do you need? How many more
*24:09.360- 24:15.300* :  toilets do you need? Let's turn to the toilets because you're noticing what lots of individual
*24:15.300- 24:25.180* :  toilets, even on the ground floor? Yep, dotted around. Why? I honestly think it is some form of
*24:25.180- 24:30.420* :  extension of the bathroom idea that you put these things in and the more you put in somehow, the
*24:30.420- 24:36.040* :  more luxurious your home is. In fact, an extension of this idea is the adoption of the Japanese
*24:36.040- 24:42.000* :  technology of the heated seats, the toilet, the placing music that has a B-Day function that
*24:42.000- 24:46.160* :  self-cleans and steams, and all of these, and does your laundry as far as I know,
*24:46.440- 24:51.320* :  and what makes it interesting to me is that the investment in bathrooms seems to pay off. That
*24:51.320- 24:56.600* :  seems to be reflected in the value of homes. The investment in toilets, that's less clear.
*24:56.940- 25:03.040* :  What's the weirdest lieu you've seen? My favourite was actually a long drop composting toilet that
*25:03.040- 25:08.000* :  Ben Law built for himself in the middle of the woods in Sussex. It was a two-seater and it was
*25:08.000- 25:12.000* :  an erased elevated platform and you could sit behind a wicker panel and look out and gaze over
*25:12.000- 25:16.940* :  the forest and it was the most magical place. It taught me actually that we're missing something here.
*25:17.600- 25:20.420* :  Where are we heading with this, do you think? You make the point about the Japanese
*25:21.140- 25:27.920* :  lieu systems. I suspect that we're heading towards this kind of rash of the toilet as the shrine.
*25:28.340- 25:33.720* :  In these toilets and bathrooms, are you seeing increasing B-Day's, if not the Japanese version?
*25:34.100- 25:38.260* :  The B-Day, I think. For your feet, obviously. Yeah, I think if you make the car comparison,
*25:38.300- 25:43.680* :  it's like the early steam cars. I think the B-Day, I think it's had its day. The Japanese
*25:43.680- 25:48.640* :  flushing electronic thing is probably the future. I'm tempted to ask if you've ever used one of
*25:48.640- 25:55.580* :  those Japanese leads. No, I have not and I don't think I'd be comfortable doing so. Kevin McLeod
*25:55.580- 26:02.360* :  talking to Sarah Montague. A new road in the Czech capital Prague has been named after a British man
*26:02.360- 26:07.020* :  who helped save hundreds of mostly Jewish children from the Nazis in the run-up to the Second World
*26:07.340- 26:13.500* :  War. Sir Nicholas Winton, who died in 2015 at the age of 106, was famously modest.
*26:13.920- 26:18.500* :  In fact, the first time that many of those he saved on the kinder transport had heard of him
*26:18.500- 26:25.120* :  was when they were contacted by the BBC programme That's Life in 1988. In a poignant moment of
*26:25.120- 26:30.500* :  television, the presenter Esther Ranson revealed to an unsuspecting Sir Nicholas that the studio
*26:30.500- 26:35.180* :  audience was made up entirely of people he'd rescued from what was then Czechoslovakia.
*26:35.640- 26:41.840* :  This is a picture of Nicholas Winton himself with one of the children he rescued. Back here is the
*26:41.840- 26:49.540* :  list of all the children. This is Vera Diemont. We did find her name on his list. Hello Vera
*26:50.260- 26:53.960* :  and I tell you that you are actually sitting next in Nicholas Winton.
*26:55.640- 27:00.840* :  Can I ask, is there anyone in our audience tonight who owes their life to Nicholas Winton?
*27:01.000- 27:02.960* :  If so, could you stand up please?
*27:12.460- 27:16.860* :  And the entire audience stood up. Well, among those taking part in the programme was Lady
*27:16.860- 27:22.700* :  Melena Grenfell Baines. She was nine when she left Prague with her three-year-old sister Eva
*27:22.700- 27:28.020* :  and travelled to England. She was eventually reunited with her parents more than a year later.
*27:28.360- 27:34.460* :  Now age 94 Lady Melena was in Prague for the new Nicholas Winton Street unveiling ceremony.
*27:34.460- 27:38.000* :  She told my colleague James Kamara Sami what the day had meant for her.
*27:38.500- 27:43.160* :  I think it's difficult to stop anyone in the street and say, have you heard of Nicholas Winton?
*27:43.780- 27:50.520* :  Practically every person in this country knows his name. Not long ago we were having a conference
*27:50.520- 27:56.820* :  and so on said, do the children know his name? And it so happens that today with us was a man who
*27:56.820- 28:04.880* :  regularly travels around schools. We've just worked out that 800,000 children in this country
*28:05.220- 28:12.340* :  know the name of Nicholas Winton. Gosh, and for you, can you tell us as you stand there in Prague,
*28:12.340- 28:16.660* :  what you know of your own story, the circumstances in which you left Prague?
*28:17.040- 28:22.680* :  Well, my own story I only know because one day of telephone rang and this voice said,
*28:22.680- 28:28.560* :  this is a steransom and that was 40 years after it all happened because prior to that,
*28:29.380- 28:37.400* :  none of us and there are hundreds knew how we got on that train and the past was almost forgotten
*28:38.120- 28:44.360* :  because even then, you know, in England Holocaust was not mentioned really until after we found
*28:44.360- 28:51.720* :  Nikki the survivors refused to talk about it for many years and then all of a sudden we now all
*28:51.720- 28:57.000* :  know, you know, what's happening. We're saying we need a new Nicholas Winton because there are so
*28:57.000- 29:02.600* :  many children who need to be helped today. What comes around goes around if one can say that.
*29:03.380- 29:09.000* :  Am I making sense? You're making perfect sense. As you're there now, do you have any instinctive
*29:09.200- 29:15.560* :  memories at all at that time? I have no memory of it. I have an autograph book which my grandfather
*29:15.560- 29:22.260* :  gave me at the night we were leaving and I called that my memory because in that he wrote a message
*29:22.980- 29:29.420* :  never to forget the land I am leaving. By 1939, the adults realized what was happening, Austria,
*29:29.420- 29:34.600* :  the Jews were already being arrested but we as children were not aware of it.
*29:34.960- 29:39.540* :  You talked about the next generations and needing people, the youngsters, to remember
*29:40.020- 29:44.740* :  what happened and so it can never happen again and you're someone who has spoken a lot at schools
*29:44.740- 29:49.820* :  and talked to young people. What is it that connects young people to your stories? Is it the
*29:49.820- 29:54.620* :  separation? Is it that the older sister having to look after a younger sister? Is it these sort of
*29:54.620- 30:00.960* :  basic things? Because I talked to different ages and the youngest ones that I talked about 9 and 10
*30:01.320- 30:07.880* :  and I also asked the teachers, they must prepare the children for what would be a sad story.
*30:08.340- 30:14.080* :  The little ones I mainly talked about having to leave home and why and I have one sample letter
*30:14.320- 30:18.540* :  that was written by a nine-year-old. I used to say to the children, do you ever say I hate you
*30:18.540- 30:24.260* :  which children do to the parents and she said now after what you told us, I cherish my parents
*30:24.260- 30:30.500* :  because I have parents to cherish and that is a nine-year-old child writing a letter and I've got
*30:30.500- 30:36.100* :  hundreds of them and the older they get, the more I tell them, the more I will explain to them
*30:36.100- 30:42.540* :  about the camps, about how my grandparents and my cousins all died in the camps. It does resonate
*30:42.540- 30:47.620* :  with them. There is absolutely no doubt. What do you feel? Do you feel Czech? Do you feel English?
*30:47.620- 30:52.760* :  What do you feel in your heart? Of course, I'm British. We've lived here since that in 39, but I think
*30:52.760- 30:58.020* :  in my cultural soul, I really feel very Czech. And do you think there's a little bit of Czech
*30:58.020- 31:03.900* :  in Senegalese? Oh, I'm convinced after all those years, there must be, yes. And he is there now
*31:03.900- 31:09.700* :  in name as well as in in memory. He is here to be remembered for always because, you know,
*31:09.700- 31:16.880* :  the proudest full of names of famous Czech people who've gone down in history. And so this will
*31:16.880- 31:21.220* :  be another one where I hope, you know, in another hundred years, people will know who Nicholas
*31:21.220- 31:28.320* :  Winter was. Lady, Melena Grenfell Bains. Now, before we go, it is just over two months until the U.S.
