*01:54.000- 02:01.000* :  to rape her has admitted his crimes in court. And in the morning, I was more or less floating for
*02:01.000- 02:07.720* :  two hours because there was not enough wind. So there I traveled maybe one or two kilometers in
*02:08.260- 02:12.680* :  two hours. How to windsurf from the Netherlands to the UK and back.
*02:16.940- 02:21.820* :  Escalating violence in Sudan is creating the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world,
*02:21.820- 02:26.380* :  according to the United Nations. And the head of the World Health Organization, who's just
*02:26.380- 02:31.580* :  returned from there has seen for himself the scale of the devastation. Tens of thousands of
*02:31.580- 02:36.480* :  people have died and 12 million have been forced to flee their homes since April last year when
*02:36.480- 02:42.520* :  Sudan was thrown into disarray after its army and a powerful paramilitary group began a vicious
*02:42.520- 02:48.560* :  struggle for power. Three out of every four children there are going hungry. That's 16 million
*02:48.560- 02:54.160* :  kids. Starving mothers are unable to feed their babies. Speaking to the BBC's Michelle Hussain,
*02:54.160- 03:00.560* :  Tedros Aternom Capriatus said one reason the crisis in Sudan was being overlooked was racism.
*03:01.620- 03:08.960* :  The situation in Sudan is very, very alarming. You know about the massive displacement. It's now
*03:08.960- 03:16.760* :  the largest in the world. And of course, famine. Imagine destruction, displacement, massive
*03:17.240- 03:23.380* :  disease everywhere. And now famine. That's so tragic when I was in Sudan actually I visited
*03:23.380- 03:31.900* :  a camp for IDPs. And also I had visited the hospital, especially the children's ward. And you see
*03:31.900- 03:39.640* :  there many children, skin and bone, imitated. And you can see also famine is in restricted areas
*03:40.120- 03:45.460* :  like California and so on. But starvation is almost everywhere. So the scale is really big. And
*03:45.820- 03:51.060* :  as you know, half of the population needs support now, which is close to 25 million of the total
*03:51.060- 03:57.540* :  population. And that's really big. And 12 million of the population is already displaced. 10 million
*03:57.540- 04:06.100* :  internally and more than 2 million who fled the country. So it's really tragic. And the attention
*04:06.100- 04:13.120* :  it gets from the international community is really low. It's not getting the attention it deserves.
*04:13.640- 04:19.300* :  And I have seen it all and I will continue to speak about it. I think Sudan deserves to be
*04:19.820- 04:26.440* :  center of attention. Why do you think it isn't? That's the sad part because you see it repeatedly.
*04:26.460- 04:36.220* :  It's not just Sudan. But you see it in other areas. You remember when there was war in
*04:36.380- 04:44.020* :  in Tigray Ethiopia, I made the same comment. It was a very tragic war. The number of people killed
*04:44.020- 04:51.800* :  is even more than what you see now in Sudan. And the level of rape was in tens of thousands.
*04:52.520- 04:59.780* :  My observation is when it comes to thousands, especially in Africa, I think the attention is
*05:00.020- 05:06.740* :  really, really low. Is race a factor in that? And I asked that because I think you did some time ago
*05:06.740- 05:11.680* :  say that you wondered whether the world gives equal attention to black and white lives. And you
*05:11.680- 05:17.100* :  were thinking on the one hand about Ethiopia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria, and you were contrasting
*05:17.100- 05:23.060* :  that with concern for Ukraine. Exactly. I think race is in the play here. That's what I feel now
*05:23.060- 05:29.480* :  because we see the pattern now. Were you shocked by what you saw in Sudan? Because I feel
*05:29.480- 05:34.160* :  listening to you that you were and yet I know that you must have seen many terrible things,
*05:34.220- 05:39.720* :  not only in your time leading the WHO, but before that. Yeah, before that because I know war.
*05:40.040- 05:45.580* :  You grew up as a child during war? Yes. So I was brought up actually in the middle of war.
*05:45.780- 05:50.120* :  And I know the smell of war, the image of war, the sound of war.
*05:50.380- 05:54.780* :  And it's impact on you. That's Ethiopia you're referring to?
*05:55.140- 06:02.620* :  Yeah, of course, the impact on me, but from that I can understand how it impacts others.
*06:03.120- 06:09.420* :  And I remember my mother actually praying that I survived a day at a time.
*06:10.420- 06:13.920* :  The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Atonanka Priasis.
*06:15.260- 06:20.780* :  A court in southern France which is holding a high profile rape case has heard from the accused
*06:20.780- 06:27.480* :  for the first time. 71-year-old Dominique Pelico is accused of administering anti-anxiety drugs
*06:27.480- 06:32.640* :  to his wife, of raping her and of recruiting others to do so while she was unconscious.
*06:33.220- 06:36.120* :  I heard more from our Paris correspondent, Huesco Field.
*06:36.860- 06:40.560* :  This case has attracted a lot of attention in France and around the world, of course,
*06:40.560- 06:45.240* :  because of the extraordinary circumstances which it relates about this man Dominique Pelico,
*06:45.900- 06:50.400* :  who he has admitted now in court today that he's did what he was accused of doing,
*06:50.400- 06:56.200* :  which is of drugging his wife repeatedly over 10 years. And in her state of unconsciousness,
*06:56.200- 07:03.420* :  raping her himself, but also, and this is where it becomes so sort of strange and upsetting,
*07:03.420- 07:09.880* :  arranging through the internet for men from the area to come and have sex with her as well.
*07:10.360- 07:14.080* :  So today, he was in court for the first time, at least he was speaking for the first time,
*07:14.080- 07:20.900* :  he's been ill, and he said, I recognize the facts, in their totality, this is what I'm shy
*07:20.940- 07:27.440* :  is true. He then said, I'm a rapist, as are all the other defendants with me here in court,
*07:27.440- 07:32.420* :  and there are 50 other men on trial in this mammoth case. So he's saying, they're rapists,
*07:32.420- 07:36.460* :  too. They knew what this was all about. They understood what was happening when they
*07:37.020- 07:42.460* :  had sex with my wife. This is obviously upon a contention though, because the
*07:42.460- 07:46.320* :  defense of all these men, or nil, or these men, is that they did not consider themselves
*07:46.320- 07:51.040* :  be rapists. They thought they were doing something that was consensual, and which had the agreement
*07:51.040- 07:55.540* :  of the woman in the case, his wife, Yuzel, even though she's, of course, absolutely unconscious
*07:55.540- 08:00.220* :  and flat out at the time. They say they think it was part of a sex game. He's saying no, they knew
*08:00.220- 08:05.580* :  what they were doing. And that, of course, is at the heart of this trial. I mean, he himself
*08:05.580- 08:11.540* :  has admitted, and he was tearful todays, described his, you know, a kind of split personality
*08:11.580- 08:16.740* :  on one side leading a perfectly happy life with this woman who he said he loved, and at the same
*08:16.740- 08:23.480* :  time, unable to resist these impulses to humiliate her and have rape her and have her raped unconscious
*08:23.480- 08:28.320* :  in this way. How did his co-accused react when he made these admissions? They've
*08:28.320- 08:33.160* :  implicated them. Well, there are 50 of them there. So it's hard to say, you know, individually,
*08:33.220- 08:37.520* :  they will react in their different ways. But we know that, I mean, certainly, when he said this
*08:37.520- 08:43.180* :  in court, there was a kind of hubbub among the defendants because he was basically attacking
*08:43.180- 08:48.280* :  their defense. Their defense is going to be, at least many of them, that they thought this was
*08:48.280- 08:53.480* :  a sex game. They went on the internet. There seemed to be something which had been agreed with
*08:53.480- 08:58.900* :  the man and his wife, and they thought they say that it was all something which was therefore not
*08:58.900- 09:05.940* :  constitutive of rape, but of sex between consenting adults. That is clearly going to be a highly
*09:05.940- 09:11.520* :  controversial defense, and it has been undermined already by the statement from the principal accused,
*09:11.520- 09:17.760* :  the man who set up the whole thing in the first place. You scoffield. Deadly floods continue to
*09:17.760- 09:23.380* :  cause devastation in Myanmar. The military government now says more than 220 people,
*09:23.380- 09:28.760* :  an owner of diet, after Typhoon Yagi struck the country. This man flared his village home in
*09:28.760- 09:39.020* :  my court district and said people were becoming desperate. We have lost many things. We lost houses,
*09:39.540- 09:45.560* :  clothes in the walls, and now the floods have swept away the house we were living in, and we cannot
*09:45.560- 09:52.580* :  save it. So there's nothing left for us. We can't even catch fish, and we're in trouble for food.
*09:52.620- 09:59.240* :  We can't stay in our houses anymore because of the floods. Villagers asked the monks to help us,
*09:59.600- 10:05.100* :  and we are sheltering at the monastery. Our correspondent in the region is Rupert Winkfield Hayes.
*10:05.620- 10:09.620* :  It has been a dramatic rise, a doubling of the death toll, but this has been going on. I mean,
*10:09.620- 10:14.480* :  this is over a period of about a week, and one of the things that's making this situation much
*10:14.480- 10:21.180* :  more complicated in Myanmar is the fact that the country is driven by civil war. Since the military
*10:21.180- 10:26.520* :  junta took over in 2021, the country has really been split up into different fiefdoms, different
*10:26.520- 10:32.100* :  warring factions, and that's making this natural disaster a great deal worse because it makes
*10:32.100- 10:37.720* :  it much more difficult to find out exactly what's going on in much of the north and the border areas
*10:38.300- 10:42.980* :  along the Chinese border, the Thai border, and even the border with India. It's very hard to tell
*10:42.980- 10:47.440* :  exactly what's going on, but it looks like a very large area of central Myanmar, all the way from
*10:47.580- 10:54.140* :  Mandalay down to Napier-do, along the Irohwadi River has been very badly flooded, and also in the
*10:54.140- 11:00.340* :  Shans state towards the border with Thailand. This has come from Typhoon Yagi that hit Vietnam
*11:00.340- 11:05.760* :  more than a week ago. This is a monster typhoon that came across the South China Sea, slammed
*11:05.760- 11:11.320* :  into northern Vietnam and Laos, and is still causing this massive flooding all the way across in
*11:11.320- 11:16.320* :  Myanmar. It sounds from what you're saying, so the death toll actually could be even worse
*11:16.320- 11:21.820* :  than we know. I think it's almost certainly going to be a lot higher than this latest figure that
*11:21.820- 11:27.040* :  the military government is giving because they control a relatively small amount of the country,
*11:27.280- 11:30.860* :  although they do control quite a lot of the area that has been flooded around the capital
*11:30.860- 11:36.020* :  Napier-do, but there are areas, like I said in the Shans state and further north, that the government
*11:36.020- 11:40.600* :  has very little control of. We understand there have been landslides in the Shans state. It's a
*11:40.600- 11:45.100* :  very mountainous hilly area. There are many people still missing, so I think we will see that the
*11:45.100- 11:50.700* :  death toll continue to climb, and that's after it killed well over 200 people in northern Vietnam,
*11:50.700- 11:55.300* :  causing real devastation in the mountains of northern Vietnam, and people in high-nan
*11:55.300- 12:00.580* :  in southern China. So this storm has really caused a massive amount of chaos wherever it has
*12:00.580- 12:06.700* :  gone right across this part of Southeast Asia. Rupert Wingfield Hayes. Donald Trump has spoken
*12:06.700- 12:11.700* :  publicly for the first time since the latest apparent attempt on his life at a golf course
*12:11.700- 12:17.140* :  in Florida. He praised his protection team and commended President Joe Biden for his response,
*12:17.140- 12:22.720* :  saying he couldn't have been nicer. Ryan Wesley Ruth, the suspected gunman, has appeared in
*12:22.720- 12:28.280* :  court in connection with the incident. The attack on Sunday has once again raised questions over
*12:28.280- 12:32.960* :  the safety of presidential candidates, barely two months after the former president sustained a
*12:32.960- 12:39.120* :  gunshot wound to his ear. Christopher O'Leary spent more than 20 years with the FBI working on
*12:39.120- 12:43.700* :  counterterrorism investigations. Well, it's a very charged political environment,
*12:43.700- 12:50.820* :  and unfortunately there has been building momentum to change this political frustration
*12:50.820- 12:57.020* :  into mobilizing towards political violence. There are trends in American history and in other
*12:57.020- 13:03.440* :  places around the world where you see patterns where this develops. And here in the United States,
*13:03.440- 13:11.100* :  there is very tense times right now. And it's a lethal combination of rhetoric, polarizing
*13:11.100- 13:18.600* :  rhetoric, the internet and the echo chambers that exist within the internet and some media outlets
*13:19.380- 13:24.780* :  as well as the political rhetoric from many different sides and the US political arena are
*13:24.780- 13:31.420* :  definitely creating a really lethal cocktail. I don't see failures, but I certainly see concerns.
*13:31.600- 13:36.860* :  Now, the Secret Service has been analyzed and criticized by many, but the Secret Service
*13:36.860- 13:45.020* :  is a very small federal agency within the United States. Only a few thousand sworn Secret Service
*13:45.020- 13:51.480* :  agents and informed members. And they have a finite amount of resources and they have a massive
*13:51.480- 13:57.960* :  undertaking to prevent political violence and assassination attempts against the current president
*13:57.960- 14:04.900* :  and the vice president, all visiting heads of state as well as every former president and
*14:04.900- 14:10.660* :  their immediate families. So it's a massive undertaking and they can have zero failures. The
*14:10.660- 14:15.980* :  challenge is, you know, with former president Trump, he's a current candidate so he rates Secret
*14:15.980- 14:21.140* :  Service protection, but it's not at the same level as the sitting president. So the resources that
*14:21.140- 14:26.820* :  he's been given are clearly not adequate to the threat level that he's facing. I will say
*14:27.580- 14:34.140* :  somebody hiding in the shrubs for 12 hours while concerning is not something that
*14:34.140- 14:41.020* :  is shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. Although the president, former president's desire to gulf
*14:41.020- 14:46.440* :  that day wasn't publicized, it does not take an investigator to figure out that president
*14:46.440- 14:53.120* :  Trump, when he goes down to our logo, likes to gulf on weekends. So that's a pattern that you
*14:54.060- 15:00.060* :  analyze and predict. And then gulfing, unfortunately, is a sequential sport. So he's going to follow
*15:00.060- 15:05.560* :  the numbered holes on the gulf course. Somebody just has to lie in wait. So that's a concern.
*15:06.180- 15:09.800* :  When you're protecting somebody, you like to mix things up and prevent patterns.
*15:10.600- 15:16.360* :  Christopher O'Leary. Now, if you had to travel from the Netherlands to England and back
*15:16.360- 15:22.880* :  all in one day, you'd probably fly. But a Dutch windsurfer has done the 400 kilometer trip on his
*15:22.880- 15:30.800* :  board in just 18 hours. Bob van der Bergd spoke to Victoria Wuenkunde. It was rough and really,
*15:30.800- 15:36.520* :  really long. In the end, it took around 18 hours to be back on the land in the Netherlands.
*15:37.180- 15:43.140* :  So it was really late last night. What was rough that in the morning, I was more or less floating
*15:43.140- 15:49.720* :  for two hours because there was not enough wind. So there I traveled maybe one or two kilometers
*15:49.720- 15:57.080* :  in two hours, which is super slow, of course. Then the wind picked up and we had to go through the
*15:57.080- 16:03.420* :  shipping lane. And then we just had to go for hours and hours and hours until we arrived in
*16:03.500- 16:10.540* :  in low stuff. There, actually, I had a really rough time because it was quite cold on the beach
*16:10.540- 16:17.820* :  and the boat had to refill. And I was there waiting in my back locked up a bit. So I felt super,
*16:19.100- 16:23.980* :  so you are doing this for a reason because with what you're talking about, rough seas and having
*16:23.980- 16:29.380* :  your back locked, you are raising money for children, in particular, one child Lucas. Tell us more about
*16:29.380- 16:35.320* :  him. I do this for a charity, which is called Muscles for Muscles. So it's a charity which is
*16:35.320- 16:41.140* :  fighting muscle diseases for kids. And through this charity, I met this kid Lucas, which is 10 years old
*16:41.140- 16:46.380* :  with muscular disease. So I'm happy I can do something good on my own way.
*17:18.820- 17:24.120* :  Explaining football to the friend who's just there for the nachos? Hard. Tailgating from home

*18:17.920- 18:23.620* :  Floods are continuing to wreak havoc and devastation as they sweep through central Europe in the
*18:23.620- 18:28.780* :  aftermath of storm Boris. In the Hungarian capital Budapest, the mayor has asked those living
*18:28.780- 18:34.320* :  near the Danube to evacuate three months worth of rainfall in the Czech Republic in three days.
*18:34.820- 18:40.240* :  Andreas von Weissenberg is in charge of the response for the Red Cross. He says his staff are
*18:40.240- 18:46.240* :  braced for water come. These masses of water and I mean some places in Austria have gotten 400
*18:46.240- 18:52.300* :  millimeters in just a few days. These are extreme numbers and before the water levels make their
*18:52.300- 18:56.660* :  way through rivers and waterways, you will take a number of days, you could take until the end
*18:56.660- 19:01.700* :  of the week, even into early next week. They are in Hungary and in Slovakia, sort of downstream
*19:01.700- 19:05.800* :  teams are on high alert to intervene as the flood water has come through.
*19:06.380- 19:11.920* :  Nick Thorpe in Budapest gave us this update. I'm on Margaret Island in the middle of the
*19:11.920- 19:15.920* :  River Danube right in the center of Budapest. I can see the Hungarian Parliament building
*19:15.920- 19:22.880* :  just in my shoulder and where I'm standing are there's a long wall of sandbags right up to my
*19:22.880- 19:28.620* :  waist really and a crowd of men packing more sandbags. These are some other sandbags which they
*19:28.620- 19:34.740* :  mayor of Budapest, Gergi Karachony has said a million sandbags have been put along these more
*19:34.740- 19:39.960* :  vulnerable points in the capital waiting for this flood wave coming down the Danube towards us now.
*19:40.220- 19:45.760* :  That is the thing isn't it? More bad weather is expected to come and the storm is heading south.
*19:46.180- 19:50.780* :  That's right. I would say at this moment it's not so much the bad weather. The sun is actually
*19:50.780- 19:55.920* :  shining to the relief of many of the people working on these flood barriers here now. It's really the
*19:55.920- 20:03.080* :  effect of the rains and even snow. Several meters of snow fell on the high ground on the mountains
*20:03.080- 20:07.880* :  in Austria over the weekend. Obviously the heavy rain and the devastation we've been seeing in
*20:07.880- 20:13.580* :  the Czech Republic and in Poland. Now the Danube all those smaller rivers which have been causing
*20:13.580- 20:19.280* :  such problems in the mountains and in the hills in other countries of central Europe. Now funneling
*20:19.280- 20:24.560* :  all of that water down into the Danube here all those big tributaries and small tributaries of
*20:24.560- 20:30.180* :  the Danube and bringing that flood wave down. Last night the river peaked in Bratislava to
*20:30.500- 20:36.720* :  slow that capital at 9.5 meters. So that's one issue the sheer level of the water rising where I am
*20:36.720- 20:42.480* :  here rising at about a meter a day expected to peak on Thursday. But then the other question will
*20:42.480- 20:47.540* :  be how long this lasts because obviously the flood defenses very well prepared in each of these
*20:47.540- 20:52.920* :  countries. But if it lasts a long time those defenses that sandbag walls like the one I'm standing
*20:52.920- 20:58.200* :  next to now can get soaked through. And so if this lasts a long time with all that water and
*20:58.480- 21:04.060* :  and the snow melting in Austria then problems could be up further down the line. And the number
*21:04.060- 21:11.520* :  of people who've lost almost everything it's huge isn't it? This is such a large area.
*21:12.040- 21:17.740* :  It is huge. I mean this is Europe's second biggest river. It flows through nine countries. It
*21:17.740- 21:23.120* :  has a catchment area of 19 countries and further down south. So the poorer countries,
*21:23.120- 21:27.380* :  Romania in particular, that's where the biggest loss of life has been so far.
*21:28.260- 21:34.200* :  Nick Thorpen Budapest. The philanthropist and billionaire founder of Microsoft Bill Gates has
*21:34.200- 21:40.200* :  told the BBC that 40 million more children will suffer from hunger's worst effects in the coming
*21:40.200- 21:46.120* :  years because of climate change. He also believes a big drop in international aid means hundreds
*21:46.120- 21:51.040* :  of millions of children are at serious risk of dying or suffering from preventable diseases.
*21:51.600- 21:56.700* :  Mr. Gates told my colleague Robby Young that although there has been progress rich countries have
*21:56.700- 22:04.780* :  a moral duty to act. The period 2000 to the start of the pandemic, everybody should be very,
*22:04.780- 22:12.620* :  very proud that aid generosity cut the child to death rate in half. And the biggest reason for that
*22:12.620- 22:19.240* :  was things like vaccines from Gobi for Tyrian pneumonia and things like bed nets from global fund.
*22:19.920- 22:25.860* :  We were spoiled. I mean that was great. That's where going down. Since the start of the pandemic,
*22:26.780- 22:34.340* :  not just the pandemic, but the interest payments and the cuts in aid mean that we're flat.
*22:35.020- 22:39.700* :  Whether it's improving malnutrition or reducing deaths, we're basically flat.
*22:40.880- 22:45.800* :  And so this year we're particularly focusing on nutrition, but overall messages, hey,
*22:45.800- 22:54.740* :  health in Africa, let's get back to the generosity and the progress that was miraculous to 2019.
*22:54.780- 22:59.940* :  It's easy to say you need to get it back or you want the world to get back to that generosity of
*22:59.940- 23:05.480* :  years gone by, but the pandemic has loaded rich nations, governments with vast amounts of debt.
*23:05.480- 23:10.780* :  People in rich nations have been like everybody around the world, suffering with the cost of living
*23:10.780- 23:16.660* :  crisis. And so what do you say to those people who say they just isn't enough money to spend more
*23:16.660- 23:22.240* :  on aid? Some people in your home country, the US, as they look toward the election in November,
*23:22.240- 23:27.840* :  who say America first, everybody else second. It's important to
*23:28.180- 23:35.340* :  dimensionize the ask here. What we're saying is that rich countries, if they're willing to spend
*23:35.340- 23:44.280* :  one percent of their budget to help poor countries, then the stability in those countries avoids
*23:44.520- 23:51.280* :  all sorts of things that you'd have to intervene in militarily or you'd have a pandemic coming
*23:51.280- 23:58.180* :  out of those countries. And just the pure moral thing of we can run a measles campaign or buy
*23:58.180- 24:04.340* :  a vaccine and save a child's life for a thousand dollars. Do you feel good about that or should you
*24:04.340- 24:09.700* :  take that thousand dollars less than one percent of your budget and spend it on other things?
*24:09.740- 24:16.580* :  And of course, voters get to decide, you know, I claim if all of this was visible to them,
*24:16.700- 24:22.260* :  they would choose to spend that one percent. The founder of Microsoft Bill Gates.
*24:23.600- 24:28.720* :  India's Supreme Court has said states cannot demolish homes of people accused of a crime,
*24:28.720- 24:34.100* :  attack tick plaintiffs in court hearings called bulldozer justice. It's a practice that is
*24:34.100- 24:39.140* :  increasingly used throughout the country. Critics say it seems to be largely practiced in states
*24:39.140- 24:44.780* :  ruled by India's governing party. They also say it unfairly targets minority communities,
*24:45.520- 24:50.480* :  especially Muslims. The Supreme Court will now issue new guidelines on property demolitions.
*24:50.480- 24:56.540* :  And it begins its hearings today. Our South Asia correspondent Samira Hussein reports from Mandler
*24:56.820- 24:59.740* :  in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.
*25:04.020- 25:11.540* :  I'm standing in front of a pile of broken bricks and rocks with steel rods and wires that are
*25:11.540- 25:17.720* :  all twisted up that just lay in a pile of rubble. I can see a pair of sneakers,
*25:18.760- 25:27.020* :  some broken mirrors, and even the head of a plastic doll. This used to be Asya Bano's home,
*25:27.860- 25:32.660* :  but one day in June authorities came and bulldozed it to the ground.
*25:35.240- 25:39.940* :  Social media videos show the moment police entered the village, accusing Asya Bano's husband
*25:40.220- 25:43.700* :  a Muslim of having beef, which is illegal in most Indian states.
*25:47.100- 25:52.000* :  By morning authorities bulldozed her house, saying it was illegally built on public land.
*25:54.720- 25:59.320* :  Overcome with grief, Asya Bano sits in a pile of rubble and broken dreams.
*26:02.360- 26:08.120* :  Where will we go now? We will take shelter in other people's homes. All our belongings are buried.
*26:09.060- 26:12.280* :  But what pains me the most is that I lost my daughter too.
*26:15.300- 26:21.040* :  Her daughter, 16-year-old Zinath, died of pneumonia just six weeks after her home was demolished.
*26:21.820- 26:27.340* :  Asya Bano is convinced it was because she was forced to sleep outside with no shelter from the
*26:27.340- 26:33.880* :  monsoons. Asya Bano's home was not the only one that was destroyed actually along this
*26:34.740- 26:41.980* :  narrow one-lane dirt road. There's about 26 homes that make up this community.
*26:43.220- 26:48.380* :  But on that June day authorities came in and bulldozed almost half of the homes.
*26:52.340- 26:56.020* :  Homes being bulldozed of people that are accused of crimes.
*26:56.880- 27:02.000* :  And that's why the Supreme Court is taking it up. Authorities are saying, well, some of these are
*27:02.000- 27:08.560* :  illegally built, or the building itself is unstable or unsafe and has to come down.
*27:09.620- 27:15.420* :  Amnesty International has documented quite a few of these cases across the country in the last
*27:15.420- 27:19.180* :  few years. And they say the reasonings are much more sinister.
*27:19.360- 27:22.460* :  It's not always the case that it is those who descend, who are targeted.
*27:22.840- 27:25.840* :  But it is generally the case that it's those people the government doesn't like.
*27:25.840- 27:30.020* :  And it is most often the case that these are minorities, particularly Muslims.
*27:30.280- 27:33.900* :  A guard for tell is the chair of Amnesty International here in India.
*27:34.120- 27:38.240* :  None of the due process is actually followed, which is why the Supreme Court has taken an interest
*27:38.240- 27:44.680* :  in this. There is a system that the government must follow. There is a due process
*27:44.680- 27:51.360* :  which it doesn't actually respect. They go about raising people's homes for no reason other than
*27:51.360- 27:55.240* :  the fact that these people are Muslim. The government didn't reply to our requests for comment,
*27:55.240- 27:58.080* :  but has repeatedly denied it, praise on minorities.
*27:59.260- 28:02.460* :  Listen to this clip from the Chief Minister of Odip Radesh,
*28:02.460- 28:08.260* :  Yogi Adityanad, where he pushes back against allegations that Muslim homes are unfairly targeted.
*28:10.640- 28:15.000* :  Show me one Muslim who can say I was innocent, and has been a victim of injustice.
*28:15.660- 28:17.780* :  Show me one. Nobody can say this.
*28:23.060- 28:26.780* :  A busy street in the city of Hujin, police are making an announcement.
*28:27.600- 28:32.040* :  We will use the harshest punishment. They're talking about what some boys will allegedly
*28:32.040- 28:38.640* :  span on a Hindu procession. The video went viral last year. The boys are Schleffman-Sudi's sons.
*28:41.400- 28:46.980* :  The harsh punishment, raising his home to the ground as a devotional Hindu song echoes in the
*28:46.980- 28:57.300* :  neighborhood. They put up a notice saying the building is structurally unsafe and will be demolished.
*28:57.860- 28:59.480* :  Take what you can, you have an hour.
*29:00.780- 29:04.760* :  Nearly accused of a crime, and the entire family pays the price.
*29:07.080- 29:12.000* :  We are in no condition to build it all over again. You cannot build a house just like that.
*29:12.700- 29:17.020* :  Despite India's highest court taking up the issue, none of the victims I spoke with
*29:17.460- 29:20.000* :  actually believe that anything will change.
*29:22.900- 29:23.740* :  Samira Hussein.
*29:24.660- 29:27.860* :  Now, does this sound like a child who hates reading?
*29:28.580- 29:34.020* :  They swung me back and forth like I was a sack of flour. I hate you guys I yelled over their
*29:34.020- 29:41.440* :  laughter. One, Jeremy began, two, Steven said, and three, Conrad finished. They launched me into
*29:41.440- 29:47.140* :  the pool, close. That's a 12-year-old Canadian girl reading her favorite bedtime book.
*29:47.960- 29:51.740* :  But it wasn't always this way. The girl's mother is the Canadian author,
*29:51.740- 29:57.380* :  Marais Silkoff, who became worried when her daughter got a smartphone and all hope of her
*29:57.380- 30:02.980* :  enjoying books, went out of the window. Desperate to introduce her to the joys of reading,
*30:02.980- 30:08.720* :  Marais took extreme action. She offered her daughter a $100 bribe to read.
*30:08.720- 30:15.160* :  Marais been writing about the experience, which has amused some parents and outraged others.
*30:15.860- 30:20.700* :  My daughter was a pretty gregarious girl. She was happy at just about anything.
*30:21.400- 30:26.280* :  She'd get excited about a new dessert cooling in the fridge, kind of jumping up and down that sort
*30:26.280- 30:31.920* :  of thing. And then when she got the phone, which did coincide with puberty, so it's hard to tell,
*30:33.520- 30:38.700* :  where one ends and the other begins. But there was definitely a change, and she entered what I
*30:38.700- 30:45.300* :  called the duvet cave stage, which was just close the door, close the blinds in her room,
*30:45.300- 30:50.880* :  under a duvet, with the phone, as long as we would allow her to stay in there.
*30:50.980- 30:59.160* :  There was a big change from a gregarious tiger to a bit more of a monosyllabic blanket slug,
*30:59.880- 31:05.720* :  wanting her to read real books, physical books, not on a Kindle, not on a screen,
*31:05.820- 31:14.120* :  was just a way to try to put a wedge into this thing that all parents of
*31:14.880- 31:21.040* :  preteens and teens and, you know, even gen alphas, young kids, are dealing with nowadays, which
*31:21.040- 31:27.500* :  is this tsunami of attention grab that we're all dealing with with the phones. You know, you're just
*31:27.500- 31:35.080* :  a single parent fighting Google and Apple and Amazon and everyone else. And it just seems like
*31:35.080- 31:42.040* :  an insurmountable battle and no matter how many time constraints you put in or blackout periods
*31:42.040- 31:48.220* :  or whatever, it just seems a bit unwinnable because you're one parental unit or, in my case, one
*31:48.220- 31:53.360* :  parent up against the system. Had you thought you enjoyed reading before she got a phone?
*31:54.200- 32:02.700* :  No, she did not. Reading at all, as many kids don't these days. You know, there was this really
*32:02.700- 32:10.240* :  depressing Pew study that came out just around 2021's kind of as the pandemic was starting to
*32:10.240- 32:19.660* :  wind down kind of the latter Omicron era. And it basically showed that there was an over 30% decline
*32:19.900- 32:29.040* :  in children around the age of 12 who said that they ever read for pleasure between 2021 and 1984.
*32:29.700- 32:36.480* :  You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out why you offered to pay your daughter $100
*32:36.480- 32:40.760* :  then to read a novel. What was her initial reaction? Absolutely. Yes.
*32:43.100- 32:49.920* :  My daughter never gets $100 for anything. And I got a lot of flak from New York Times readers
*32:49.920- 32:56.760* :  because as expected, a lot of readers said, well, that's nice that you've got a hundred bucks
*32:56.760- 33:02.260* :  that you can throw at your daughter to read a single book. I don't have that type of money.
*33:02.260- 33:09.000* :  I don't have a money tree growing in my backyard. But the point of this was that it was an
*33:09.000- 33:17.160* :  ungodly amount of money, at least in my household, for a 12 year old to get. I wanted my daughter to know
*33:17.260- 33:24.580* :  that this was really, really important and that it was such a serious thing for me and such an
*33:24.580- 33:33.120* :  important thing for her that I was willing to pay her a mint of money in order to try it.
*33:33.400- 33:38.520* :  Of course, she would have tried for 20 bucks or something like that. But I just don't think
*33:38.520- 33:43.500* :  there would have been the same dedication because she knows that, you know, I'm a journalist. I'm
*33:43.500- 33:48.980* :  not rolling in money, right? So she knows that for me to give her a hundred bucks is a big thing
*33:48.980- 33:53.840* :  and that she'd better take it seriously. And she did. And the thing about the experiment,
*33:54.560- 34:00.160* :  it really worked. So, you know, it's only a few months on now, but she's read a couple of other
*34:00.160- 34:06.380* :  books. She says she'd read more. And before I did this, she refused to read any book.
*34:06.920- 34:09.080* :  Canadian author, Marie Silkov.
