*01:18.460- 01:24.140* :  World Service. Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Friday,
*01:24.140- 01:29.900* :  the 27th of September. The US Vice President Kamala Harris has told Vladimir Zelensky she will
*01:29.900- 01:34.700* :  support him in his battle with Russia and criticize those calling on Ukraine to give up land
*01:34.700- 01:39.940* :  for peace. In an apparent change of heart, Donald Trump has said he will now meet the Ukrainian
*01:39.940- 01:45.880* :  President. And in a busy day of diplomacy in Washington, the White House says talks on a cease-fire
*01:45.880- 01:50.520* :  deal for Lebanon are continuing even as Israel keeps up its bombardment.
*01:52.600- 02:00.140* :  Also in the podcast, my day-to-day will not change and I look forward to defending myself and
*02:00.140- 02:06.620* :  defending the people of this city. Staying defined with the mayor of New York, Eric Adams has
*02:06.620- 02:10.400* :  been charged with taking bribes and illegal campaign contributions.
*02:14.540- 02:19.340* :  With the US election fast approaching, Vladimir Zelensky is keen to ensure that whoever wins,
*02:19.340- 02:24.440* :  Ukraine will have continued American support in the battle against the Russian invaders.
*02:24.440- 02:29.580* :  To that end, the Ukrainian leader has met the Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris
*02:29.580- 02:33.480* :  at the White House after holding talks with her current boss, Joe Biden.
*02:33.880- 02:41.620* :  Today we have a new support package, $7.9 million. This will be a great help and I
*02:41.620- 02:47.020* :  raised with President Biden the plan of victory. Today we are preparing to discard the details
*02:47.020- 02:53.740* :  to strengthen the plan, coordinate our positions used and approach our teams will work together
*02:53.740- 02:57.700* :  to ensure that implementation of our future steps.
*02:58.080- 03:03.200* :  For her part, the US Vice President said she stood fully behind Mr. Zelensky and Ukraine.
*03:03.780- 03:09.340* :  As I have made clear on our six previous meetings and throughout Putin's brutal aggression
*03:09.340- 03:15.200* :  and war against Ukraine, my support for the people of Ukraine is unwavering. I've been
*03:15.200- 03:21.180* :  proud to stand with Ukraine. I will continue to stand with Ukraine and I will work to ensure
*03:21.180- 03:29.020* :  Ukraine prevails in this war. And in a veiled criticism of her Republican opponent Donald Trump,
*03:29.020- 03:33.840* :  she said those calling on Ukraine to surrender territory in order to end the war were
*03:33.840- 03:39.600* :  essentially supporting proposals of surrender. A short while later, former President Trump said he
*03:39.600- 03:44.940* :  would meet Vladimir Zelensky on Friday after it looked like he would snub the Ukrainian leader.
*03:45.380- 03:49.140* :  Well, for more on Mr. Zelensky's meeting at the White House, I spoke to our correspondent
*03:49.140- 03:55.400* :  there, Jenny Kumar. Kamala Harris, as you heard there, spoke with her continuing unwavering support.
*03:55.540- 04:01.760* :  And I guess there were two things that President Zelensky was focused on during these meetings
*04:01.760- 04:08.700* :  with the Vice President and the President. And that was continued political support and continued
*04:08.700- 04:15.160* :  military support. So what we heard from Vice President Harris was that things would continue
*04:15.180- 04:21.120* :  the same if she were elected. But in a swipe to her Republican rival, she said there were some
*04:21.120- 04:26.360* :  in the U.S. who wanted Ukraine to surrender. And she said it was imperative for the U.S.
*04:26.360- 04:30.860* :  and the world to fight for Ukraine's sovereignty and democracy. Now, the Harris campaign
*04:30.860- 04:38.320* :  has said, basically, a Trump-balanced administration would sell out Ukraine and cozy up to President Putin.
*04:38.880- 04:43.700* :  Yeah, we'll look at the Republican position in a moment, but President Biden still has what
*04:43.700- 04:47.740* :  four months left in office. What more can he do in that time to help Ukraine?
*04:48.380- 04:55.940* :  Well, he has announced today a Â£8 billion age package and further weapons support.
*04:56.200- 05:03.400* :  But the top ask for a long time has been permission to use Western missiles on targets deep inside
*05:03.400- 05:08.920* :  Russia. Now, there's been no public granting of that permission. Even if there was, we would be
*05:08.920- 05:15.480* :  unlikely to hear of it before any strikes actually happen. Now, in the past couple of days, Donald
*05:15.480- 05:22.640* :  Trump has been very critical of Vladimir Zelensky, and now Republicans are angry with the Ukrainian
*05:22.640- 05:29.540* :  leader. I mean, has he permanently blotted his copybook if the Republicans win the presidential election?
*05:30.400- 05:34.440* :  So this whole meeting here at the White House has been somewhat of shadowed by this growing
*05:34.440- 05:41.560* :  row with the Republicans. And yes, there's been increasingly critical comments of President Zelensky
*05:41.560- 05:47.140* :  from Donald Trump. So for example, yesterday, at a campaign rally in North Carolina, he said that
*05:47.140- 05:52.660* :  the Ukrainian people were dead and the country was destroyed. So raising further questions about
*05:52.660- 05:59.120* :  any future support. And there's also been another almost diplomatic rail where a senior Republican
*05:59.120- 06:04.600* :  has accused President Zelensky of election interference. And that's because he visited a weapons
*06:04.600- 06:10.440* :  factory and they say this was in a key battleground state of Pennsylvania. It was with top
*06:10.600- 06:17.500* :  Deborah Crats and there weren't any Republicans involved. And the House Speaker, Republican Mike
*06:17.500- 06:23.300* :  Johnson has called for the resignation of the Ukrainian ambassador. Jenny Kumar at the White House.
*06:23.500- 06:28.140* :  And just a reminder that we are doing a special Q&A podcast on the US presidential election
*06:28.140- 06:33.420* :  in a couple of weeks. So if you have a question you'd like to put to our America's colleagues in
*06:33.420- 06:42.000* :  Washington, then please send us an email to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk or tweet us at global
*06:42.000- 06:46.500* :  news pod. Perhaps you'd like to know what the outcome of the election would mean for the war
*06:46.500- 06:51.860* :  in Ukraine or indeed something on our next item, the widening conflict in the Middle East.
*06:52.020- 06:54.900* :  And thanks to those who have already sent in voice notes.
*06:56.040- 07:01.920* :  After ignoring demands to halt the fighting in Gaza, the Israeli Prime Minister has now rejected
*07:01.920- 07:08.200* :  a proposal for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon. Benjamin Netanyahu promised to keep fighting
*07:08.200- 07:13.880* :  Hezbollah with full force until victory is achieved on the northern border. David Mensa is a
*07:13.880- 07:19.740* :  spokesman for the Israeli government. By hitting Hezbollah, the way we are in the very
*07:19.740- 07:25.900* :  calibrated way, but also in a way that causes Hezbollah, the terrorist organization devoted to our
*07:25.900- 07:32.700* :  destruction, by hitting them in the way that really hurts. It's actually Israel, which is making
*07:32.700- 07:37.820* :  the possibility for a political diplomatic resolution much more realistic.
*07:38.520- 07:43.300* :  Well, Hezbollah has continued to fire rocket into Israel, something it's been doing for the best
*07:43.300- 07:49.160* :  part of a year, forcing thousands to leave their homes. Those residents who've stayed say the Israeli
*07:49.160- 07:53.100* :  military shouldn't agree to the U.S.-led plan to halt the offensive.
*07:54.600- 08:00.480* :  21 days, they will arrange again, they will bring new missiles, I don't believe in them.
*08:01.200- 08:07.740* :  We must finish with this, to kill them, to stop them, to do something, but not stop the world.
*08:09.180- 08:14.080* :  But behind the scenes at the United Nations where world leaders are gathered for the general
*08:14.080- 08:20.220* :  assembly, efforts are continuing to try to secure a ceasefire. Our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*08:20.220- 08:23.840* :  Daniel Dismoni gave me this update on Israel's position.
*08:24.840- 08:29.340* :  Prime Minister Netanyahu arrived in New York where he's going to be speaking at the UN General
*08:29.340- 08:34.740* :  Assembly and stepping off the plane. He made plane that this is the policy. He said we're going to
*08:34.740- 08:40.420* :  keep striking Hezbollah until we've met our goals. And that goal, which was set last week by
*08:40.420- 08:45.280* :  his government, is to return home 60,000 Israelis who've been displaced in the north of the country
*08:45.280- 08:49.680* :  by his Bala rocket fire. And since then, we've seen all of these strikes against his Bala
*08:50.140- 08:55.320* :  and these very, very extensive airstrikes this week. And the rhetoric from the Israeli leadership
*08:55.320- 09:00.300* :  is that the only way to achieve this goal is through military means. Previously, there was more
*09:00.300- 09:05.280* :  openness, at least verbally, to a diplomatic way forward, but that seems to have closed.
*09:05.860- 09:09.840* :  And certainly it's a coalition government here in Israel. And when there was talk about this
*09:09.840- 09:14.480* :  possible ceasefire, some of his coalition partners, including the security minister and the
*09:14.480- 09:19.120* :  finance minister, both came out and said they would simply not accept it. So certainly this
*09:19.120- 09:23.360* :  government has been talking down any prospect of a diplomatic solution to this.
*09:23.700- 09:27.820* :  Yeah, well, in the US, the White House's discussions are still continuing for this possible
*09:27.820- 09:34.880* :  21-day ceasefire. But in the past few hours, Israel says it has secured nearly nine billion dollars
*09:34.880- 09:40.460* :  worth of US military aid. So it doesn't like Washington wants to use any possible leverage it
*09:40.460- 09:46.280* :  may have. Well, I think Washington has verbally been saying for a long time that they want a
*09:46.280- 09:51.760* :  diplomatic way out of this. They say they're working very hard on a solution. They've said that
*09:51.760- 09:57.280* :  there could be devastating consequences if this conflicts with his Bala. It escalates, for example,
*09:57.280- 10:03.400* :  if there's a ground invasion by Israel. But it does obviously still have leverage over Israel.
*10:03.400- 10:09.060* :  Some people are very critical and says it doesn't use all the leverage it has. I think what remains
*10:09.060- 10:14.180* :  to be seen, what other kind of pressure might be placed on Israel. But certainly, I think the
*10:14.180- 10:18.720* :  diplomatic efforts are going to go on. And with Params Netanyahu speaking that you end, I think he's
*10:18.720- 10:25.620* :  going to kind of answer those who are calling on him to do a ceasefire. Daniel Simone in Jerusalem.
*10:25.660- 10:31.580* :  On Thursday, Lebanon's health ministry said 40 people had been killed in the latest Israeli
*10:31.580- 10:37.660* :  airstrikes bringing the total to almost 700 since Monday. Israel's Air Force edited
*10:37.660- 10:44.060* :  struck more than 200 targets, including Hasbala infrastructure sites and weapons storage facilities.
*10:44.060- 10:49.660* :  But many ordinary Lebanese are suffering. This man's spoken front of the rubble of a destroyed
*10:49.660- 10:58.740* :  house in the Bakar Valley. The Israeli enemy has committed massacres and genocide in Gaza.
*10:59.400- 11:06.540* :  And he's now repeating it here in Lebanon. This house is peaceful and consists of three children
*11:06.540- 11:14.480* :  and an elderly mother. What do these civilians have to do with this? Thousands of people have
*11:14.480- 11:19.380* :  fled their homes and taken shelter at displacement centres. Others have left Lebanon altogether
*11:19.420- 11:26.040* :  with reports of more than 30,000 crossing into Syria. Our correspondent, Rami Ruhiam,
*11:26.040- 11:32.200* :  is in tire on the southern coast of Lebanon. I asked him whether Hasbala wants a ceasefire.
*11:32.920- 11:37.940* :  I think they are keen for a ceasefire, but crucially for a ceasefire that includes Gaza. That
*11:37.940- 11:44.080* :  has been the position of Hasbala since they started attacking Israeli positions first in the
*11:44.080- 11:49.560* :  occupied Shabbar farms and then across the border. They said this is a support front for Gaza
*11:49.560- 11:55.200* :  and they said that it will not stop until the Israelis stop their onslaught in Gaza.
*11:55.780- 12:01.500* :  So in Hasbala's view, a ceasefire is one that includes Gaza and one that does not break that
*12:01.500- 12:06.040* :  link that they insist on, the link between the Lebanese front and the Gaza front. Of course,
*12:06.040- 12:12.120* :  the Israelis are adamant that they want to break exactly that link. So it's not exactly clear how
*12:12.120- 12:17.940* :  the two positions can be in any way brought closer together. But while the fighting goes on,
*12:17.940- 12:25.340* :  it seems Hasbala is taking much worse punishment than Israel. Israel says a Hasbala drone commander
*12:25.340- 12:30.140* :  was killed. How damaging are these attacks on its military infrastructure? Well, we can't really
*12:30.140- 12:35.680* :  know. There's certainly damaging, no doubt. And you know, the the pager attacks were also very,
*12:35.680- 12:41.720* :  very damaging. The assassination in Dahia on Friday was probably more damaging, but yes,
*12:41.720- 12:47.540* :  absolutely. They have taken very, very big and very, very painful blows, but they have also
*12:47.540- 12:53.480* :  expanded the geographic scope of their attacks. And they've also increased the firepower. They have
*12:53.480- 13:00.220* :  also brought in new weapons, new kinds of missiles into play. So they certainly were not paralyzed
*13:00.220- 13:06.980* :  by all of these very painful blows. And it appears that the way things look, there's only one way
*13:06.980- 13:13.440* :  it can go. And that's more escalation. There doesn't seem to be any way out of this at the moment.
*13:13.440- 13:21.060* :  Rami Ruhayem in Tire in Southern Lebanon. The mayor of New York is arguably the most powerful city
*13:21.060- 13:27.100* :  official in the world. But the man who currently has the job, Eric Adams, is facing five criminal
*13:27.100- 13:33.580* :  charges. Once a rising star of the Democratic Party, he's accused of bribery, soliciting campaign
*13:33.580- 13:39.600* :  contributions from foreign nationals and conspiring to commit wire fraud. The U.S. District Attorney
*13:39.600- 13:45.880* :  Damien Williams said that Mr. Adams had crossed bright red lines for years. The conduct alleging
*13:45.880- 13:50.760* :  the indictment, the foreign money, the corporate money, the bribery, the years of concealment,
*13:50.760- 13:57.120* :  is a grave breach of the public's trust. Year after year after year, he told the public he received
*13:57.120- 14:02.540* :  no gifts, even though he was secretly being showered with them. The corruption alleging the
*14:02.540- 14:08.700* :  indictment is, as I said, long running. The benefits, the free upgrades, or free tickets altogether,
*14:08.940- 14:15.540* :  the hotel stays, and the value. And if you just sum up all the dollar amounts here, you get to
*14:15.540- 14:21.900* :  more than $100,000. Mayor Adams denies all the charges. He told a news conference he'd been demonized.
*14:22.720- 14:30.840* :  This is not surprising to us at all. The leaks, the commentaries, the demonizing,
*14:31.560- 14:36.500* :  and I ask New Yorkers to wait to hear out defense before making any judgments.
*14:37.180- 14:44.460* :  I will continue to do the job for 8.3 million New Yorkers that I was elected to do.
*14:45.020- 14:50.040* :  Our correspondent Nettafik in New York told me more about the charges unsealed on Thursday.
*14:50.880- 14:57.580* :  The U.S. Attorney Damien Williams actually held up a cardboard layout of the different
*14:57.580- 15:05.840* :  travel benefits that he alleges Eric Adams received, luxury flights, different tickets to events.
*15:05.840- 15:14.020* :  And they say it amounted to $100,000 in bribes, essentially. And what they're alleging is that
*15:14.020- 15:20.700* :  this was a decade-long scheme that really ramped up when Eric Adams ran for mayor.
*15:21.060- 15:28.260* :  And that not only did he accept these illegal foreign donations, but that he applied for a
*15:28.260- 15:34.160* :  New York program that matched those donations, which amounted to him essentially a stealing $10
*15:34.200- 15:41.200* :  million in public funds. And they say that the Turkish officials, and one official, I should say,
*15:41.200- 15:47.780* :  and the businessmen, did get Eric Adams to do them favors. In one instance, a Turkish
*15:47.780- 15:53.600* :  consulate high-rise building that had safety concerns, well, Eric Adams pressured a fire
*15:53.600- 16:00.180* :  department officials allegedly to get that approved. So officials laid this all out in a press conference.
*16:00.180- 16:05.180* :  And the background to this is essentially that Eric Adams, he knows that he's been under
*16:05.180- 16:10.220* :  this cloud of federal investigation for nearly a year, but he has fought against it.
*16:10.220- 16:17.600* :  He has kind of claimed that he's being targeted by prosecutors for trying to bring up issues
*16:17.600- 16:23.800* :  during his administration, including that of the migration issue. So Eric Adams, remaining defiant,
*16:23.800- 16:30.200* :  saying he will stay in office, that he will not resign, and claiming that this is all essentially
*16:30.200- 16:37.000* :  a witch hunt against him. Netette Talfique in New York. In our previous podcast, we reported on
*16:37.000- 16:42.840* :  new global study that found that children's eyesight is getting worse, with one in three now
*16:42.840- 16:48.620* :  near sighted. In China, the communist authorities have unveiled a plan to address that issue,
*16:48.620- 16:53.880* :  and at the same time tackle the problem of obesity, that affects one in five Chinese children,
*16:53.880- 16:59.380* :  as well as improve children's mental health. The Chinese government says school children should
*16:59.380- 17:04.600* :  spend at least two hours a day doing physical activity. Some of it outdoors. I heard more about
*17:04.600- 17:10.140* :  the plan and reaction to it from our China media analyst, Kerry Allen. So real problems with
*17:10.140- 17:16.200* :  young Chinese students, sitting for long periods of time, eating junk food, and developing
*17:16.260- 17:21.420* :  eye problems. The idea is that this new rule will ensure that students can get outside, get some
*17:21.420- 17:25.820* :  sunshine, talk with one another more, and it's also good for their mental well-being.
*17:26.000- 17:31.140* :  Do they not get enough outside activity at the moment then? They don't, not really, so normally
*17:31.140- 17:35.760* :  there are breaks in between classes that are very, very short. When I lived in China, I worked at
*17:35.760- 17:41.620* :  a school for a period of time, and a lot of students find that it's very, very difficult to find
*17:41.620- 17:46.100* :  somewhere to have a little space to play before having to rush back in. Yes, it sounds like they'll
*17:46.100- 17:50.520* :  have to make some considerable changes then. Yes, and that's one of the concerns on Chinese
*17:50.520- 17:55.400* :  social media platforms today. So a lot of people on the platform Weibo, which is China's equivalent
*17:55.400- 17:59.840* :  of a platform like Facebook or X, they're saying that unless there are regulations,
*17:59.840- 18:05.740* :  they ensure schools have to do this. They think that it won't happen, but there are some who
*18:05.740- 18:11.020* :  think these have been big problems, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, when students were
*18:11.020- 18:16.000* :  remote studying for a long period of time. They were in their homes not moving in front of
*18:16.200- 18:20.440* :  computer screens for eight hours a day. They can see the benefits in this, and they're hoping that
*18:20.440- 18:25.360* :  it could provide benefits to young Chinese children. Yeah, I mean, the benefits of physical activity
*18:25.360- 18:29.700* :  are well known. Why didn't they think about something like this before? Well, there's a lot to get
*18:30.140- 18:36.160* :  in Chinese schools. So in primary schools, in particular, students learn Mandarin. They learn
*18:36.160- 18:42.180* :  literature, maths, English. The Communist Party rhetoric is also integrated into classes, so
*18:42.180- 18:49.660* :  students have, for example, classes in moral education. And PE is also included, but PE is not
*18:49.660- 18:54.500* :  something that has been given a high priority for a long period of time. There are concerns that
*18:54.700- 19:00.140* :  students who spend a lot of time in PE, it might not amount to much career wise, but in light of
*19:00.140- 19:05.000* :  these growing health problems amongst young Chinese children, it's now something that the government
*19:05.000- 19:12.800* :  seems keen to prioritize. Carry out. And still to come on the global news podcast. These people
*19:12.800- 19:20.380* :  are used to seeing death, but not on that scale and not like that. And whatever the figures show you,
*19:22.860- 19:29.620* :  the experience for them was was indescribable. Emotional testimony at the UK COVID inquiry.
*19:37.680- 19:41.440* :  Explaining football to the friend who's just there for the nachos? Hard.
*19:42.200- 19:47.200* :  Tailgating from home like a pro with snacks and drinks everyone will love, any easy win.

*20:13.080- 20:17.920* :  are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising
*20:17.920- 20:22.600* :  prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you
*20:22.600- 20:27.560* :  talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited

*20:43.820- 20:50.020* :  It's been 10 years since the shocking disappearance of 43 students in Mexico. The trainee
*20:50.020- 20:54.800* :  teachers were abducted and killed, apparently by local police officers in collusion with
*20:54.800- 21:00.700* :  organized crime gangs. The suspected massacre in Guerrero State has been called one of Mexico's
*21:00.700- 21:06.660* :  most infamous human rights cases. The investigation was marred by allegations of corruption and a coverup,
*21:07.040- 21:11.980* :  only three of the victims have ever been identified. On Thursday to mark the Anniversary
*21:11.980- 21:18.080* :  Families and Supporters gathered in Mexico City to demand justice. Paul Henley heard more about
*21:18.080- 21:24.080* :  the crime from our correspondent in Mexico City, Will Grant. Well, in essence, Paul, you touched on it
*21:24.080- 21:29.580* :  there. It is one of the most emblematic human rights violations in Mexican history, certainly in
*21:29.580- 21:36.780* :  modern Mexico, arguably in modern Latin America. The name Ayotsinapa, where this tiny student
*21:36.780- 21:42.940* :  teacher college is based, will forever be synonymous in Mexico with the disappearance and
*21:43.420- 21:53.060* :  supposed murder of the 43. The fact that a state forces are believed in independent investigations
*21:53.060- 21:59.080* :  to have been involved alongside organized crime and be that it's never been solved, that they
*21:59.080- 22:03.600* :  simply do not know where the vast majority of those bodies lie. Tell us about the demonstrations.
*22:04.560- 22:08.960* :  Well, as you can imagine, they're gathering in what is essentially the center of Mexico City. They're
*22:08.960- 22:15.980* :  hoping to walk to the presidential palace itself, the national palace. Make their point very, very
*22:15.980- 22:21.420* :  clearly that they feel let down by President Lopez Obrador, a man who said as a campaign promise
*22:21.420- 22:27.340* :  he would leave no stone unturned in this investigation, who has called it a state crime,
*22:27.340- 22:33.460* :  but during his administration, the independent investigators had to abruptly leave Mexico saying
*22:33.460- 22:38.580* :  they were hitting a number of official obstacles when it came to looking at the involvement of
*22:38.580- 22:43.960* :  the military and something that he says is simply not the case that the military were involved. He
*22:43.960- 22:50.540* :  agrees that local forces may have been involved, but doesn't believe that it goes any further than that.
*22:50.540- 22:55.260* :  The thing is, for the families, they may get no further than a certain point on their route,
*22:55.500- 22:59.320* :  because the barricades are firmly up and there is a big, big police presence.
*22:59.440- 23:04.620* :  The new president-elect says she is seeking accountability. How hard a task is that?
*23:05.260- 23:11.640* :  It's huge, I think, because what has been lost in this decade is any sense of shared ground,
*23:11.640- 23:17.720* :  common ground between the Lopez Obrador administration, indeed the party, the governing party,
*23:17.720- 23:24.780* :  Morena, and the victims and their supporters. I think all goodwill has been lost over these years by
*23:24.780- 23:30.700* :  the fact that the victims' families who have kept up their fight for justice simply feel
*23:31.000- 23:35.160* :  they've been pushed back, they've been taken in one direction, pulled back in the other,
*23:35.540- 23:41.580* :  lied to to their faces, and they feel let down by successive administrations. The Pena Nietzsche
*23:41.580- 23:46.920* :  administration under whose watched this horrific situation took place, and the Lopez Obrador
*23:46.920- 23:52.540* :  administration who promised to solve it. Well, grounds in Mexico City. It's been a while since
*23:52.540- 23:57.280* :  COVID dominated the headlines, but it hasn't gone away. The Chinese authorities have,
*23:57.280- 24:02.240* :  for example, warned that the coronavirus is still evolving in potentially dangerous ways.
*24:02.980- 24:07.440* :  In London, on Thursday, we got a reminder of the darkest days of the pandemic at the
*24:07.440- 24:13.500* :  official inquiry into Britain's handling of COVID. Professor Kevin Fong saw the impact first hand
*24:13.500- 24:18.660* :  in hospitals in his role as the National Health Services Advisor for Emergency Preparedness.
*24:19.600- 24:24.840* :  We had nurses talking about patients raining from the sky. One of the nurses told me that they
*24:24.840- 24:30.100* :  just got tired of paying people in body bags. Now, the hospital, but they said that sometimes they
*24:30.100- 24:35.940* :  were so overwhelmed that they were putting patients in body bags, lifting them from the bed,
*24:35.940- 24:40.460* :  putting them on the floor, putting another patient in that bed straight away, because there wasn't time.
*24:42.040- 24:47.820* :  We went to another unit where things got so bad, they were so short of resource that they ran
*24:47.820- 24:53.280* :  out of body bags and they were instead issued with nine foot clear plastic sacks and cable ties,
*24:53.280- 25:00.260* :  and those nurses talk about being really traumatised by that, because they had recurring
*25:01.120- 25:06.280* :  nightmares about feeling like they were just throwing bodies away. These people are used to
*25:06.280- 25:12.020* :  seeing death, but not on that scale and not like that. Professor Kevin Fong, with part of his
*25:12.020- 25:17.440* :  evidence, the inquiry into Britain's response to COVID. Something rather different now,
*25:17.440- 25:23.180* :  and scientists in China say they have discovered the world's oldest known cheese from three and a
*25:23.180- 25:29.120* :  half thousand years ago. They analysed dairy samples found with Bronze Age bodies buried in the
*25:29.200- 25:35.400* :  Xinjiang region of western China and discovered goat cheese and fermenting microbes from kefir.
*25:36.020- 25:40.640* :  Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer on Chinese cuisine, which doesn't usually feature cheese,
*25:40.640- 25:46.460* :  so was she surprised by the discovery? Well, not really, and I think what this highlights is that
*25:46.460- 25:51.320* :  Chinese cuisine has always been very multicultural and shaped not only by ancient indigenous
*25:51.320- 25:57.500* :  traditions, but also by contact with people from, you know, in this period of time and the early
*25:57.500- 26:04.220* :  dynasties, and with people from the northwest. So across north China, you still see the legacy of
*26:04.220- 26:09.580* :  contact with all these nomadic peoples to the north and the west. And yeah, very interesting.
*26:09.580- 26:15.760* :  I mean, still within Chinese borders, you have Uighurs, Tibetans, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and they're all
*26:15.760- 26:20.900* :  people who have daring traditions and who eat various kinds of dairy food. But not the prevalent
*26:20.900- 26:26.540* :  culture. So what happened then? Well, so for a long, many parts of Chinese history, there were
*26:26.540- 26:31.840* :  eras and there were areas where people did have a daring tradition. So there's a very famous
*26:31.840- 26:37.880* :  six-century agricultural manual, which has a whole section on keeping cows and sheep and making
*26:37.880- 26:43.220* :  things like yogurt. During the tang dynasty, more than a thousand years ago, the upper class is
*26:43.240- 26:47.800* :  it something like ghee, clarified butter, and various kinds of yogurt and cheesy foods.
*26:48.680- 26:54.640* :  But in the later dynasties, yes, it sort of became a very minority thing and largely died out
*26:54.640- 27:00.840* :  by the end of the Qing dynasty. So in China today, there are pockets of very fascinating
*27:00.840- 27:07.420* :  cheese making. So for example, in Yunnan province in the southwest, the E people, that's one of the
*27:07.420- 27:13.920* :  minority groups in this very diverse region, they make a goat's milk cheese, which is very like
*27:13.920- 27:20.160* :  Indian paneer, a sort of simple fresh cheese. And another group in dali in Yunnan province
*27:20.160- 27:25.140* :  makes something a bit like mozzarella where they're stretching the curds and then sun drying the
*27:25.140- 27:31.380* :  cheese. So you have these little pockets of cheese making, but it never really caught on.
*27:31.720- 27:36.900* :  I think what's really fascinating is that the Chinese didn't really need cheese because
*27:37.420- 27:42.800* :  quite early on, they started using the soybean, which is very protein rich and offers a similar
*27:42.800- 27:47.000* :  sort of series of amino acids to those, you know, essential for human nutrition.
*27:47.120- 27:51.860* :  And can be fermented, what, and also to give, you know, that's sort of richer flavour too, right?
*27:52.040- 27:57.040* :  They fermented soybeans to make things like the ancestors of soy sauce fermented beans with
*27:57.040- 28:02.160* :  these rich umami flavours. And then from at least a thousand years ago, more than a thousand years
*28:02.160- 28:07.460* :  ago, they were making tofu. But the thing that's so interesting is that the technology of making tofu
*28:07.460- 28:12.820* :  is terribly like the technology for making simple cheeses. You know, you have a milk, in this case,
*28:12.820- 28:19.620* :  a bean milk, and you coagulated, you know, cheeses in Europe is mostly coagulated with
*28:19.620- 28:26.220* :  rennet, an animal enzyme, but in China they use gypsum mineral salts and things to coagulate.
*28:26.220- 28:32.100* :  The soybean, but you end up with something that looks quite cheese-like, so the Chinese perhaps
*28:32.100- 28:37.820* :  didn't really need cheese in the same way. You should unlock talking to James Menendez.
*28:38.680- 28:43.320* :  Astronomers have just published a new map of the Milky Way, the galaxy that includes our own solar
*28:43.320- 28:52.140* :  system. It is a big thing to map, 950,000 trillion kilometres wide. It takes light about 100,000
*28:52.140- 28:57.240* :  years to get across. Professor Catherine Heyman's is the astronomer royal for Scotland.
*28:57.240- 29:01.100* :  She's been telling us what the new map brings to our understanding of the Milky Way.
*29:01.680- 29:07.680* :  Any listeners out there who are lucky enough to live in a dark sky location will have seen that
*29:07.680- 29:13.380* :  faint band of stars that arches all the way across the night sky that marks out the plain
*29:13.380- 29:21.240* :  of our Milky Way galaxy. And it's that starry arch that has been observed for 13 years now,
*29:21.700- 29:26.140* :  using the Vista telescope that's spaced down now in Chile in the Atacama desert.
*29:26.640- 29:32.120* :  And what they've done is they've mapped out all of the objects in that arch of the Milky Way,
*29:32.400- 29:35.600* :  but in the southern hemisphere, so looking into the centre of our Milky Way galaxy.
*29:36.080- 29:40.980* :  And what's really fantastic about this telescope, what's really niche about it, is it looks in the
*29:40.980- 29:45.440* :  infrared. I like to think of this telescope as it's kind of like our Commando telescope. When you
*29:45.440- 29:49.120* :  watch the movies, you see the Commando's go out at night and they can't see anything, so they put
*29:49.120- 29:53.820* :  on their night vision goggles. That's exactly what we're doing with Vista because when you look into
*29:53.820- 29:59.660* :  our Milky Way galaxy, it's full of dust which obscures the light that we can see with our own eyes.
*29:59.960- 30:06.420* :  So we have to look in the infrared light to pier through the dust to see baby stars forming.
*30:07.000- 30:10.620* :  And the montage of images that have been released that you can go and look at
*30:11.080- 30:15.680* :  show some of the prettiest points in our Milky Way galaxy where you see these
*30:15.960- 30:20.440* :  nurseries, stellar nurseries, where these brand new stars are forming gorgeous,
*30:20.440- 30:27.620* :  colourful, gassy regions of our galaxy where new stars are being formed and new planets are being
*30:27.620- 30:30.120* :  created. Professor Catherine Heyman's
*30:30.820- 30:35.960* :  Let's return now to the fighting in Lebanon. Thousands of people have fled their homes in the
*30:35.960- 30:41.780* :  wake of Israel's continued strikes against Hezbollah. One of those people is Sarah. She was
*30:41.780- 30:46.880* :  forced to leave her home to try to find safety further north and she's now living together
*30:46.880- 30:52.040* :  with 12 other family members in temporary accommodation. We can hear from her now and just a warning,
*30:52.040- 30:57.140* :  there are some first hand descriptions of recent attacks that some listeners might find distressing.
*30:58.020- 31:04.600* :  It was literally one deadly week. Three different events happened. The first event was the
*31:04.600- 31:11.420* :  Pajor's explosion and then the second day the Wauki-Tauki explosion. And then two days after that
*31:11.420- 31:18.020* :  we had another explosion, the southern suburb of Peru. All of these things happened very close
*31:18.020- 31:23.760* :  to where I live and where other family members live as well. Things escalated really quickly.
*31:24.280- 31:30.680* :  When the first incident related to the Pajor's explosion happened, I look at my phone and I find
*31:30.680- 31:36.700* :  lots of missed calls on my phone. And then I call my husband and he tells me to rush and try to
*31:36.700- 31:42.180* :  get my kids. I have two kids who were in the daycare. So he was just telling me that people are
*31:42.180- 31:48.340* :  exploding. And I was in shock. I didn't understand. What do you mean by people exploding? I mean,
*31:48.820- 31:55.120* :  is this real life or is this some movie you're narrating for me? I just had to rush to my car.
*31:55.120- 32:00.180* :  I started driving and things weren't clear at all. I started getting other calls from friends,
*32:00.180- 32:04.280* :  from family members, telling me people are dropping from the balcony. People are
*32:04.280- 32:11.820* :  exploding and people didn't really understand what was happening until my aunt told me she called
*32:11.820- 32:17.600* :  and told me it was a Pajor problem. Pajors are exploding. So people are dying on the streets.
*32:17.700- 32:24.540* :  It took me almost an hour to get to the daycare where my children are. I was terrified. I wasn't
*32:24.540- 32:31.140* :  sure if I would find them. And it was this one hour that I was driving that made me feel that
*32:31.800- 32:37.820* :  this is unexplicable. I haven't even seen this in horror movies, you know.
*32:38.540- 32:42.440* :  What's the process you then went through thinking, okay, what do we do then?
*32:42.840- 32:50.560* :  I feel very lucky because unlike a lot of the Lebanese people, thankfully we have a relative that
*32:50.560- 32:55.940* :  has a flat in an area outside Beirut and this relative is outside the country.
*32:56.240- 32:59.900* :  What have you said to your children? I know they're young, but how have you explained to them
*32:59.900- 33:06.240* :  why their lives are suddenly turned upside down? My eldest is a three and then my second child is
*33:06.240- 33:12.540* :  almost two years old. My eldest was preparing to go to school. I had to tell her some positive
*33:12.540- 33:18.720* :  things, of course, that we get to spend some time with family. You get to play a lot. So they're
*33:18.720- 33:24.300* :  happy so far. Is it cramped with 12 of you or is there enough space? It's really cramped. I mean,
*33:24.300- 33:31.560* :  every family gets one room literally. It's not nice. But at the same time, I mean, we're all very close
*33:31.560- 33:36.300* :  to each other. So it's nice living with them. It's not that we don't like living together. It's
*33:36.300- 33:41.560* :  just you don't have enough space to live with your family, you know. Do you think you'll ever be
*33:41.560- 33:47.540* :  able to go home? Of course, I will go back home. I have full faith. But it just may take a long time.
*33:47.800- 33:52.620* :  No matter how long it takes, we will go home. And that was Sarah talking to Andrew Peach.
*33:55.160- 33:59.340* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon. This
