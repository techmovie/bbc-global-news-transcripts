*01:29.360- 01:34.200* :  This is a special updated edition of the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service,
*01:34.720- 01:37.460* :  bringing you the latest on the US presidential debate.
*01:40.100- 01:45.320* :  I'm Paul Moss and as we're recording this podcast, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have just finished
*01:45.320- 01:49.840* :  trading blows in what's been a bitter and at times volatile debate.
*01:50.420- 01:53.980* :  She is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman.
*01:53.980- 01:59.840* :  She says clearly I am not Joe Biden and I am certainly not Donald Trump.
*02:00.360- 02:03.180* :  We'll have more from the debate and analysis from Washington.
*02:05.820- 02:08.260* :  Also in this podcast, the rest of the world news.
*02:09.060- 02:14.580* :  Western nations have imposed news sanctions on Iran for supplying Russia with ballistic missiles
*02:14.580- 02:20.120* :  to use against Ukraine and 26 people are confirmed dead and dozens more are missing
*02:20.740- 02:24.160* :  after a boat carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Senegal.
*02:27.960- 02:33.720* :  It's been said that presidential election debates rarely change voters opinions or shift the
*02:33.720- 02:40.300* :  polls much one way or the other and yet this has already been an election contest like no other
*02:40.300- 02:45.660* :  in American history. And with the two sides closer than ever, even a small shift in support
*02:45.660- 02:49.620* :  could make a big difference, particularly in those key swing states.
*02:49.620- 02:54.940* :  And while this was not a unique debate, it was certainly more heated than most.
*02:54.940- 02:58.220* :  The allegations about each candidate more exotic.
*02:58.220- 03:02.760* :  He was Donald Trump blaming Kamala Harris for letting in too many immigrants
*03:03.480- 03:08.320* :  and repeating a debunked allegation that they had unusual culinary tastes.
*03:08.940- 03:14.580* :  In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats,
*03:14.600- 03:20.240* :  they're eating, they're eating the pets of the people that live there.
*03:20.820- 03:24.120* :  And this is what's happening in our country and it's a shame.
*03:24.360- 03:26.480* :  The Springfield City Manager says there's no evidence of that.
*03:26.480- 03:28.760* :  We'll find out. I'll let you respond to the rest of what you've heard.
*03:29.060- 03:31.000* :  I think you're talking about extreme.
*03:32.480- 03:36.560* :  Kamala Harris has previously been criticized for laughing too much, but her
*03:36.980- 03:41.560* :  mirthful derision there was a stance she often took during the debate when confronted with
*03:41.560- 03:46.780* :  Donald Trump's allegations. It had been widely reported that Mr. Trump's team were telling him
*03:46.780- 03:52.800* :  to refrain from abuse, to hold back on the aggression. But it's not entirely clear he was listening.
*03:52.800- 03:56.000* :  But then Kamala Harris was very much on the front foot.
*03:56.420- 04:00.540* :  Here she was warning of what a Trump presidency would mean for the war in Ukraine.
*04:01.400- 04:04.920* :  If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kiev right now.
*04:05.640- 04:10.920* :  And understand what that would mean, because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine.
*04:10.920- 04:17.440* :  Why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up
*04:18.320- 04:24.240* :  for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator
*04:24.880- 04:26.240* :  who would eat you for lunch?
*04:27.040- 04:30.620* :  I asked our correspondent to Washington Tom Bateman for his assessment.
*04:31.040- 04:35.700* :  Well, I think you're going to hear both sides talk about why this works out for them,
*04:35.700- 04:40.840* :  that it was a victory for them. That's inevitable. There wasn't a major disaster involved in this.
*04:40.840- 04:45.680* :  It wasn't like the June debate. You saw confident performances from the two of them.
*04:46.080- 04:52.480* :  But I think given that Kamala Harris had the bigger challenge here as the untested quantity,
*04:52.840- 04:58.040* :  the new entrance to the race, I think they're going to be pretty pleased and happy with the
*04:58.040- 05:03.940* :  result here. Because what you saw throughout this was the sort of temperament of Donald Trump,
*05:03.940- 05:10.960* :  his frustration and a point anger sort of showing through him feeling he had to resort to his
*05:10.960- 05:18.340* :  political rally mode and really starting to get into some of those more rambling lines that you
*05:18.340- 05:25.080* :  hear him giving his supporters. Well, she attempted really to keep a very cool and calm approach to
*05:25.700- 05:31.600* :  this and really effectively baiting him and then sort of setting a trap and then allowing him to walk
*05:31.600- 05:36.160* :  into it. And we saw that happen really quite a few times throughout this. The moderators would then
*05:36.200- 05:40.480* :  try to fact check some of the more outlandish things that Donald Trump was saying and that was
*05:40.480- 05:46.160* :  making him angry at. So I think the dynamics at which he had clearly carefully tried to orchestrate
*05:46.160- 05:51.260* :  works for her and I think her side will be pretty pleased with the result tonight.
*05:51.600- 05:55.300* :  There was, as you said, quite a lot of baiting. There were insults, but
*05:55.800- 06:00.000* :  contrary to some predictions, they did get into the nitty gritty of policy. What were the
*06:00.260- 06:04.960* :  the standout issues do you think? Well, they really did, actually. And there were a few moments
*06:04.960- 06:10.140* :  where you thought both the because of the strength of the question from the ABC host.
*06:10.600- 06:16.600* :  And also just some moments of revelation. For example, they pressed Donald Trump on whether he
*06:16.600- 06:22.180* :  wanted Ukraine to win the war against Russia. They asked him that repeatedly and he wouldn't
*06:22.180- 06:26.960* :  say that. What he talked about is he wanted the war to end. Now, that was very telling.
*06:26.960- 06:31.880* :  I think that the Harris side will interpret that or want it to be interpreted as him refusing
*06:32.480- 06:36.800* :  to see that there should be a Ukrainian victory at the end of this and therefore
*06:36.800- 06:41.640* :  abandoning a US ally. But that was a strong line of journalistic questioning. I thought there
*06:41.640- 06:47.760* :  was also a moment where on gun control, where Kamala Harris repeatedly said she wanted to come
*06:47.760- 06:50.960* :  back on a point that Donald Trump had said that she wanted to take everyone's guns away.
*06:50.960- 06:55.060* :  And she came back and said that Tim Walls, her running mate and her were both gun owners.
*06:55.480- 07:00.340* :  Now, that was an insightful moment that I think a lot of viewers wouldn't necessarily have
*07:00.960- 07:06.100* :  known about. So there were some important moments. And it did, as you say, get into quite a lot of
*07:06.100- 07:13.520* :  detail in important policy areas, but both domestic and foreign as well. And what you saw was Kamala Harris.
*07:13.520- 07:18.440* :  I think there was a preparedness to realise that the economy is a weak point for her because of the
*07:18.440- 07:24.280* :  very significant inflation that's happened under Biden Harris administration. And she'd obviously
*07:24.280- 07:28.680* :  made a conscious decision not to shy away from that. She really turned it, tried to turn it to
*07:28.680- 07:32.580* :  a campaigning point. Repeatedly saying she wanted to create this opportunity economy,
*07:33.080- 07:39.040* :  $50,000 of start-ups for new businesses and talked about this opportunity economy,
*07:39.040- 07:44.940* :  which became really a tagline that she used in her sort of closing statement as well.
*07:44.940- 07:50.120* :  So it did get into the detail. You told this programme, just as the debate was getting underway,
*07:51.080- 07:54.960* :  that election debates don't normally shift opinion much, but that this time
*07:54.960- 08:00.500* :  might be different. Obviously, it's too early. The polls haven't come out yet, but what's your guess?
*08:02.220- 08:08.540* :  Well, I mean, I sort of stand by the first point that you're not going to see fundamental shifts
*08:08.540- 08:14.440* :  in the opinion polls, but that's really the point about this race that it is so close. I think
*08:14.440- 08:20.520* :  we were saying earlier, there's probably around 150,000 voters that will be the most critical
*08:20.980- 08:24.700* :  decision makers in this because they haven't really made their minds up yet, or a bit more
*08:24.700- 08:30.880* :  perhaps lying across six or seven swing states. But I do think, as I come back to the point,
*08:30.880- 08:36.940* :  I think her side, knowing that they had to insert themselves into the minds of voters as her being
*08:36.940- 08:42.960* :  a serious quantity, that these people could vote for, I think that will work to their favour.
*08:42.960- 08:47.280* :  But I don't think we're going to see a sudden shift of the needle in the way the polls are at
*08:47.280- 08:52.760* :  the moment. In her closing statement, Carmela Harris said she wanted to turn over a new page for
*08:52.760- 09:00.560* :  America. I intend to create an opportunity economy investing in small businesses, in new families,
*09:00.560- 09:07.900* :  in what we can do around protecting seniors, what we can do that is about giving hardworking folks
*09:07.900- 09:14.920* :  a break and bringing down the cost of living. I believe in what we can do together that is about
*09:14.920- 09:20.500* :  sustaining America's standing in the world. In response, Donald Trump accused her and the
*09:20.500- 09:26.180* :  Democrats of having betrayed the American people. So she just started by saying she's going to do
*09:26.180- 09:31.440* :  this. She's going to do that. She's going to do all these wonderful things. Why hasn't she done it?
*09:31.760- 09:36.660* :  She's been there for three and a half years. They've had three and a half years to fix the
*09:36.660- 09:42.180* :  border. They've had three and a half years to create jobs and all the things we talked about.
*09:42.640- 09:48.920* :  Why hasn't she done it? Surely after the debate, our BBC North America correspondent Anthony
*09:48.920- 09:54.800* :  Zurker gave us this analysis of the candidates' performance. I think it was really interesting to see
*09:54.800- 10:01.200* :  how Carmela Harris's strategy from the geto was to try to go Donald Trump into topics in areas he
*10:01.200- 10:06.600* :  didn't want to be on. Talking about his crowd size, hitting him on foreign leaders, laughing at him.
*10:06.600- 10:11.600* :  Time and time again, she got him on the defensive on areas where Carmela Harris may have been weak,
*10:11.600- 10:16.380* :  like immigration and the economy. And then when there were issues where Carmela Harris was the
*10:16.380- 10:22.500* :  strongest on abortion, she was able to go on the attack. So if a debate is won and lost on the
*10:22.500- 10:28.180* :  train on which the debate is held, on taking advantage of your strengths and deflecting your
*10:28.180- 10:32.960* :  weaknesses, it was a very good night for Carmela Harris. I think it'd be hard for Donald Trump's
*10:32.960- 10:38.300* :  side to feel good about what happened tonight because Harris did come in with weaknesses, came in
*10:38.300- 10:43.220* :  with areas where the poll showed that voters have real questions about her on the economy,
*10:43.220- 10:48.640* :  on the administration's handling of Afghanistan, on immigration. And Donald Trump wasn't ever able
*10:48.640- 10:53.300* :  to push those attacks really home. He seemed to get caught up in defending himself,
*10:53.300- 10:58.160* :  defending his crowd size as I mentioned, defending his record on civil rights, those sorts of
*10:58.160- 11:03.880* :  things. It sucked him into response to that chewed in time he could have been using to really land
*11:03.880- 11:08.480* :  rhetorical blows on Carmela Harris. That's all from the US presidential debate now to the
*11:08.480- 11:13.260* :  rest of the world news with Nick Miles. Well, as we heard there, one of the most important issues
*11:13.260- 11:18.580* :  nationally in the US election and one that's actually on the ballot in many states in November
*11:18.580- 11:25.340* :  is the question of access to abortion. In 2022, when the US Supreme Court overturned its landmark
*11:25.340- 11:31.620* :  Roe vs. Wade ruling that protected a woman's right to an abortion, Missouri became the first state
*11:31.620- 11:37.300* :  to implement a near blanket ban on the procedure. The only exception being cases where the mother's
*11:37.300- 11:42.040* :  life is in danger. Women have to travel to abortion clinics outside the state,
*11:42.040- 11:47.140* :  as James Menendez reports. It was heart-wrenching. My world crumbled that day.
*11:47.460- 11:52.880* :  That's Erica who lives on the other side of the state in the confusingly named Kansas City.
*11:53.420- 11:58.160* :  A year and a half ago, she was given the news that no mother to be wants to hear.
*11:59.040- 12:06.340* :  I had a very wanted pregnancy. When my doctor came in and told me my son who we named
*12:06.340- 12:15.680* :  Easton had fetal anomaly and she went on to share what it meant if he survived and so for us,
*12:16.040- 12:22.380* :  thinking about our living child, Easton and his quality of life, our marriage, we did make the
*12:22.380- 12:30.780* :  choiceless choice to seek an abortion. And compounding that horrible situation was the fact that
*12:30.780- 12:36.940* :  Missouri has an almost total ban on abortions. Were there big questions about how you were going
*12:36.940- 12:42.620* :  to get the treatment, the abortion you needed? So when I got to maternal fetal medicine and they
*12:42.620- 12:50.800* :  ran the additional tests, she told me where I could go and it was a 10-hour car ride to Denver,
*12:50.800- 12:58.720* :  Colorado, or an airplane to Washington, D.C. There are those on the other side of the argument
*12:58.720- 13:04.380* :  who believe the sanctity of the fetus' life is the most important thing. What do you say to them?
*13:04.980- 13:12.780* :  Our decision was made out of immense motherly love and fatherly love. I did not want my child
*13:12.780- 13:19.340* :  to suffer. Yeah, that means that I will forever miss him and greet him and wish that things were
*13:19.340- 13:25.400* :  different. But as a parent, aren't you supposed to protect your child? Aren't you supposed to love
*13:25.480- 13:28.720* :  them, even if it means that you don't get what you want?
*13:31.020- 13:33.720* :  Missouri became the first abortion free state.
*13:36.500- 13:38.020* :  Missourians have fought hard.
*13:38.160- 13:43.400* :  Opponents of Amendment 3 as the vote on restoring the right to an abortion in Missouri is known
*13:43.400- 13:49.560* :  are still battling in the courts and in the court of public opinion to get it struck off the
*13:49.560- 13:56.360* :  ballot in November. That campaign is being led by Republican State Senator Mary Elizabeth Colman.
*13:56.860- 14:01.060* :  I believe that every life is sacred and that we should do everything we can to protect the
*14:01.060- 14:05.860* :  unborn. And all the polling suggests that a majority of Americans believe that there should be
*14:05.860- 14:11.940* :  some access to abortion. And we've seen Donald Trump, for example, apparently flip-flopping on
*14:11.940- 14:16.740* :  where he stands on this issue because he seems to be aware that actually this may cost him
*14:17.040- 14:21.400* :  the election. Do you think that's true? No, I think if you look at the history of what Donald
*14:21.400- 14:27.160* :  Trump has done in this issue, it's been a little bit messy. Going back to the 2016 campaign,
*14:27.160- 14:32.560* :  I think that like most Americans, it's not his top issue. He's not paying attention to it at
*14:32.560- 14:36.660* :  the same level. And so he'll say things and then he'll learn more and he'll say, you know what?
*14:36.660- 14:41.960* :  Actually, I was wrong on that. That was Mary Elizabeth Colman ending that report by James
*14:42.940- 14:47.700* :  and within the past few hours, Missouri's top court has ruled that a proposed abortion rights
*14:47.700- 14:53.600* :  amendment to the state constitution will appear on the ballot in November, allowing voters to
*14:53.600- 14:59.320* :  decide whether to restore legal abortion in Missouri. The United States and its allies are
*14:59.320- 15:05.680* :  imposing new sanctions on Iran and Russia over what they call Terran's escalatory decision
*15:06.240- 15:11.060* :  to supply ballistic missiles to Moscow. On a visit to London on Tuesday, the U.S. Secretary of
*15:11.060- 15:16.480* :  State Anthony Blinken warned that Russia had received shipments of ballistic missiles from Iran
*15:16.480- 15:22.480* :  and was likely to use them in Ukraine within weeks. For some time, the United States is warned
*15:22.480- 15:29.360* :  of an additional threat, the provision by Iran of ballistic missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine.
*15:30.880- 15:36.720* :  We've warned Tehran publicly, we've warned Tehran privately that taking this step would constitute
*15:36.720- 15:41.920* :  a dramatic escalation. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner told us more about the weapons.
*15:42.520- 15:47.700* :  This is a weapon system called the Fata 360. Fata means victory. It's an Arabic word, but
*15:47.880- 15:52.820* :  it means the same thing in foreign policy. They are short to medium range ballistic missiles,
*15:52.820- 15:58.240* :  but ballistic missiles basically goes up in a parabola and comes down very fast. They've got a
*15:58.240- 16:05.080* :  maximum range of 75 miles, which is what roughly about 120 kilometers, but they can carry a payload
*16:05.080- 16:11.140* :  of up to 150 kilos of high explosive. It's thought that they're going to be deployed on the
*16:11.140- 16:18.480* :  battlefield in the next few weeks. They will be quite a game changer for Russia because it will allow
*16:18.480- 16:25.740* :  Russia to use these against Ukrainian frontline positions, helping to push back their forces
*16:25.740- 16:31.240* :  in the Donbass where they're already slowly retreating and freeing up Russia's own arsenal
*16:31.240- 16:37.520* :  of longer range ballistic missiles, which they will then use to make life absolutely miserable
*16:37.520- 16:44.360* :  for people in Kiev, Odessa, Lviv, Rivno, further afield cities like that. And there was further
*16:44.360- 16:52.220* :  detail coming out today from the Russians about a new bilateral treaty between Russia and Iran.
*16:52.220- 16:58.540* :  And that suggests that this might not just be a one-off these missiles. It goes to the future as
*16:58.540- 17:03.460* :  well. So that's doubly concerning. They, as in the US and Britain, are very concerned about this
*17:03.680- 17:08.720* :  and also disappointed, I think, because Iran has a new precedent. And Iran has made it clear that
*17:08.720- 17:14.720* :  it wants to reach out and rejoin the rest of the world and take its place. It's rightful seated
*17:14.720- 17:21.080* :  international forums and so on. They're saying it's going on about it in exactly the wrong way.
*17:21.080- 17:27.600* :  It's going in the opposite direction by supplying these weapons and in return getting technology
*17:27.600- 17:35.580* :  from Russia, missile technology and nuclear technology, forging this alliance of the pariahs
*17:35.980- 17:40.480* :  as somebody once called it. Well, it's a troubling cooperation, I guess. Don't forget that the two
*17:40.480- 17:45.360* :  countries have got a common body of water between them, the Caspian Sea. And that's where they were
*17:45.360- 17:50.120* :  able to ship these missiles across. Clearly, the US has been able to detect this, probably through
*17:50.120- 17:56.280* :  satellites, but it could be human or signals intelligence as well. And the US and the UK have shown
*17:56.280- 18:01.680* :  that disappointment, as you expressed it, in saying that there will be further sanctions on
*18:01.680- 18:08.700* :  Tehran, but we've seen the sanctions don't necessarily prevent Tehran from developing these
*18:08.700- 18:13.880* :  new weapons and sending them abroad. They don't. So the sanctions package has already been announced.
*18:13.880- 18:19.040* :  There's a number of individuals who've been sanctioned, but I think most relevant, perhaps to
*18:19.260- 18:25.580* :  to UK and Europe, is that the E3 that's Britain, France and Germany have announced some trade
*18:25.580- 18:31.940* :  sanctions which include transport. And that means that Iran Air, Iran's national carrier is going
*18:31.940- 18:38.520* :  to be restricted from landing in Britain, but not for another year. So in that sense, it's pretty
*18:38.520- 18:46.200* :  toothless. Frank Gardner. As we record this podcast, 26 people are now known to have died after
*18:46.200- 18:52.800* :  a wooden boat carrying migrants capsides off Senegal's coast on Sunday. The authorities say more
*18:52.800- 18:57.700* :  than a hundred people were on board. Our Africa Regional Editor Richard Keigo reports.
*18:58.320- 19:03.320* :  Distraught, relatives and friends have gathered along the beach, anxiously waiting for news of
*19:03.320- 19:08.560* :  their loved ones. So far, four people have been rescued and such efforts are still underway.
*19:09.020- 19:15.080* :  The boat are departed from Boer, about 80 kilometers south of Dakar, bound for Spain's Canary Islands.
*19:15.080- 19:20.340* :  In recent years, the number of migrants living with Africa through Senegal has surged.
*19:20.600- 19:25.880* :  Mostly young men, fling conflict, poverty and unemployment are attempting the dangerous
*19:25.880- 19:32.820* :  Atlantic road to the Spanish islands, with nearly 30,000 arrivals recorded this year. Richard Keigo.
*19:35.600- 19:39.740* :  Still to come. Why should I have to cut my hair and people can have their hair all the way down
*19:40.780- 19:45.620* :  to their hips and as long as they want, but because my hair grows out, I need to cut it.

*21:13.300- 21:17.940* :  In Ukraine, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has said his team
*21:18.300- 21:22.140* :  are doing all they can to deliver justice for crimes committed by Russia.
*21:22.800- 21:27.820* :  Karim Khan was speaking on a visit to Kiev at a children's hospital that was badly damaged by
*21:27.820- 21:34.120* :  a Russian missile back in July. The ICC has already issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and
*21:34.120- 21:38.600* :  senior members of the Russian military, a move which Moscow has condemned.
*21:38.600- 21:42.480* :  Our Europe correspondent Nick Beak sent this report from the hospital.
*21:46.540- 21:51.340* :  A mum desperately calls out for her daughter. A missile has just hit their hospital.
*21:51.960- 21:57.740* :  Oksana says she has no idea if her 16-year-old daughter Solomia is alive or dead.
*21:58.780- 22:00.800* :  Later, they do find each other.
*22:04.280- 22:10.180* :  Today, on a video call, Solomia told us her overwhelming emotion that morning had been fear.
*22:14.240- 22:18.040* :  It was very scary, but I tried not to listen to the explosions and take on.
*22:19.080- 22:22.660* :  When the missile hit, I didn't immediately understand what had happened.
*22:22.940- 22:28.280* :  I thought that maybe I was overthinking and worrying too much, but after some time I understood
*22:32.500- 22:36.660* :  everything. It's two months now since the missile strike at this hospital and in front of us
*22:36.660- 22:42.220* :  is what remains of the intensive care unit. Part of it has been completely leveled.
*22:42.540- 22:46.540* :  All the windows are blasted out. There's a huge amount of debris.
*22:47.400- 22:50.960* :  And the site of cancer patients, intensive care patients,
*22:51.020- 22:55.260* :  bloodied, covered in dust and debris being rushed to safety,
*22:55.720- 22:59.760* :  shocked a lot of people, even in this war of so much death and devastation.
*23:00.060- 23:04.640* :  And for a lot of Ukrainians, it represented Russia sinking to a new level,
*23:05.100- 23:08.440* :  in striking Ukraine's biggest children's hospital.
*23:09.880- 23:12.940* :  The International Criminal Court has been investigating.
*23:13.020- 23:18.300* :  And today its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, came to see the damage for himself,
*23:18.380- 23:23.220* :  and told us his team were pursuing all avenues to help deliver justice.
*23:23.780- 23:28.220* :  We're here for a purpose. It's not a sightseeing visit. It's to move forward,
*23:28.220- 23:32.100* :  to make sure we pierce the veil of immunity and make sure the law is felt.
*23:32.300- 23:33.280* :  And that's why we're here.
*23:34.080- 23:39.680* :  Ukraine says Russia hit the hospital. Moscow claimed it was a Ukrainian air defense missile,
*23:40.280- 23:44.660* :  but the United Nations concluded it was highly likely it was a Russian missile.
*23:45.620- 23:50.400* :  So what does Solemya's mum Oksana think the ICC's investigation will bring?
*23:53.200- 23:57.760* :  I think that this will not lead to anything, to any positive result.
*23:58.940- 24:03.560* :  There are international organizations in the world that could prevent all this happening
*24:03.560- 24:07.600* :  in Ukraine, but no one has done anything so far.
*24:09.060- 24:13.080* :  We put this to the ICC's prosecutor, Karim Khan, while he was at the hospital.
*24:13.800- 24:17.060* :  We're doing our best. It's not going to bring the dead back to life, and it's not going to mean
*24:17.060- 24:22.420* :  that it's any easier for the treatment that she's having, but we're doing our part.
*24:22.440- 24:26.660* :  If everybody plays their part, hopefully it can mitigate some of the harrowing stories
*24:26.660- 24:28.740* :  that we're hearing around the world and also hearing Ukraine.
*24:29.460- 24:34.860* :  Both Ukrainian and international prosecutors hope in time, evidence gathered here
*24:35.220- 24:40.240* :  will help point to a pattern of Russian attacks, attacks far from the front line,
*24:40.940- 24:43.880* :  with vulnerable civilians in the line of fire.
*24:44.380- 24:49.340* :  Nick Beak. The international human rights charity Global Witness says it's documented
*24:49.340- 24:56.360* :  196 killings during 2023 of people who were trying to stop the destruction of natural environments
*24:56.360- 25:01.460* :  around the world. The reports lead author Laura Theronis told my colleague Paul Henry,
*25:01.460- 25:07.560* :  who are the people who lost their lives were? A Colombian small-scale farmer trying to get on
*25:07.560- 25:13.820* :  with a daily life and having this at a small clots of land encroached by corporate interests,
*25:13.820- 25:19.320* :  activists in the Philippines trying to fend off the structures of the land to make way
*25:19.320- 25:26.100* :  for a large-scale airport, indigenous peoples in the Amazon trying to protect their forests.
*25:26.580- 25:31.300* :  Latin America seems to be a center of these kind of killings,
*25:31.300- 25:36.660* :  tragically and Colombia, especially why there. Civil society and social movements and
*25:36.660- 25:40.200* :  indigenous peoples and local communities are really powerful in Latin America,
*25:40.700- 25:46.020* :  so they're really able to make their voices heard and they're being attacked for doing so.
*25:46.020- 25:52.000* :  But also that doesn't mean in any way that being a defender in regions like Asia or Africa
*25:52.000- 25:58.080* :  is any safely. And how carefully researched is your data? Can you establish direct links in
*25:58.080- 26:03.500* :  all these cases between the murder of an individual and specific, say, corporate interests?
*26:04.160- 26:11.000* :  In 2023, for instance, out of 196 cases we were able to identify mining as the sector
*26:11.000- 26:16.620* :  link to the largest amount of cases and that was 25 all in all. But murders are the most
*26:16.620- 26:23.480* :  brutal form of attacks. But our report also features a number of cases from around the world
*26:23.480- 26:28.900* :  of defenders who are luckily very much alive, but are subject to authors of non-lethal attacks,
*26:28.900- 26:34.420* :  including criminalization, which is under rise globally, but also threats and harassment
*26:34.420- 26:36.880* :  and sexual violence. I mean, the list goes on and on.
*26:37.240- 26:39.380* :  Who do you hope your report will influence most?
*26:39.920- 26:44.120* :  Well, we're hoping that the report will really strike a chord with government around the world
*26:44.120- 26:49.420* :  whose responsibility it is to protect land and environmental defenders and to make sure
*26:49.420- 26:55.220* :  that they provide safe operating environments for them so they can just do their works without
*26:55.220- 27:00.940* :  fearing for the lives. And we're also hoping that corporate big enterprises will do the right
*27:00.940- 27:07.600* :  thing, which is exercise due diligence and therefore identify way before they come to any land
*27:07.660- 27:12.680* :  to establish their extractive projects, just establish what risks there are and talk to the
*27:12.680- 27:17.920* :  communists there, you know, talk to them about what the risks might be and and make right decisions
*27:17.920- 27:23.800* :  about their operations that go beyond just profit and take into account a possible human rights
*27:23.800- 27:30.740* :  violations. Laura Ferronis. Mel B from the band The Spice Girls has joined other black women in
*27:30.740- 27:36.620* :  British entertainment by calling on MPs to end discrimination against anyone with afro hair.
*27:37.160- 27:42.240* :  A letter signed by a hundred people says that hair discrimination is a panicious form of
*27:42.240- 27:47.920* :  oppression, which dates back to the slave trade. To stop this, they want the UK's Equality Act
*27:47.920- 27:54.200* :  updated to make afro hair, a protected characteristic along with age, race, religion and sexual
*27:54.200- 28:00.720* :  orientation. The call has been made ahead of World Afro Day on Sunday. Actress and broadcast to
*28:00.720- 28:06.200* :  Sarah Jane Crawford is part of the campaign. She told my colleague Sarah Montague about the
*28:06.200- 28:10.920* :  discrimination. So it's really important to think about it in three main areas. So we've got
*28:10.920- 28:16.780* :  school where typically, you know, a style that is synonymous with afro hair from braids, fades,
*28:16.780- 28:22.940* :  locks, cane rows, styles that are typically penalized in school. There are bands around having
*28:22.940- 28:27.680* :  those hair styles, you know, right from the get go individuals are made to feel on a psychological
*28:27.680- 28:33.420* :  level as if the hair is inferior, it's not good enough. And I think it's because the Eurocentric
*28:33.420- 28:38.720* :  aesthetic is considered to be more neat, tidy and professional. The other area, of course,
*28:38.720- 28:44.380* :  then naturally goes into employment where again, afro hair is deemed unprofessional, which means
*28:44.380- 28:48.260* :  that, you know, you experience anxiety before you even go into the workplace because we actually
*28:48.260- 28:54.240* :  have research that shows that, you know, you are less likely to get a promotion from even being
*28:54.240- 28:59.740* :  hired in the first place. And then the third area is health. What's really, really sad is that
*28:59.740- 29:03.980* :  women of colour are more likely to be impacted by harmful toxins because of hair straightening
*29:03.980- 29:09.540* :  products. And because of this desire to go after the kind of like professional Eurocentric aesthetic,
*29:09.540- 29:14.600* :  you know, afro hair is synonymous with african heritage. So if you protect the characteristic of
*29:14.600- 29:19.880* :  afro hair, then a teacher or someone in the workplace, it's then illegal for them to want you to
*29:19.880- 29:23.700* :  have straight hair. It's then illegal for them to tell you that you can't wear braids because
*29:24.200- 29:29.140* :  obviously this is an afro-centric style or cane rows or of, you know, a fade if you're having
*29:29.140- 29:34.540* :  your hair short or locks. No, I have to say you have the most amazing hair. Thanks. Have you ever
*29:34.540- 29:41.040* :  experienced any of that? I think that definitely for me there was like an unspoken rule going into
*29:41.040- 29:45.840* :  the world of broadcasting that I needed to have straight hair. I think it's definitely changed.
*29:45.840- 29:50.200* :  I was chemically straightening my hair from as young as teenage against my mother's wishes.
*29:50.840- 29:55.740* :  But my mother being Caucasian has a different hair type to mind. So she spent years trying
*29:55.740- 29:59.200* :  to find different hair products for me that were going to work. And, you know, she was navigating
*29:59.200- 30:04.420* :  a journey of not being exactly sure what to do. And this is the case, you know, with a lot of mixed
*30:04.420- 30:09.460* :  heritage families as well. The industry in terms of hair care has definitely moved on. But how's
*30:09.460- 30:13.700* :  the conversations around what is deemed professional? I mean, it would be naive for us to say, is
*30:13.700- 30:17.400* :  that even going on? Do you see what I mean? Well, the mad thing is, of course, if you have straight
*30:17.400- 30:21.620* :  hair, you're trying to get some body and up for it the whole time. But, you know, I mean, you know,
*30:21.760- 30:28.440* :  so if a woman works into a workplace with a suit on and she has locks or a really large afro,
*30:28.440- 30:34.220* :  that is not generally deemed to be professional as an aesthetic. And so, therefore, indirectly,
*30:34.220- 30:38.820* :  what I think very directly, that is in itself racism. And that's why we need to update the
*30:38.820- 30:42.700* :  legislation, update the Equality's Act and include Afro hair as a characteristic.
*30:43.220- 30:44.080* :  Sarah Jane Crawford.
