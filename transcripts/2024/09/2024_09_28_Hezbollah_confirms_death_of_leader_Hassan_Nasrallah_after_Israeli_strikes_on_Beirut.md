*02:37.160- 02:41.540* :  I'm Nick Miles, it's 13 hours GMT on Saturday the 28th of September.
*02:42.180- 02:47.380* :  His bullet has confirmed that its leader Hassan Nasrallah has been killed in an Israeli airstrike.
*02:49.640- 02:54.960* :  This attack was repaired for a long time, executed at the right moment with great precision,
*02:55.480- 02:59.380* :  and now we are moving forward with careful preparation for the next steps.
*03:00.000- 03:03.600* :  The Iran-backed group vowed to continue its fight against Israel.
*03:03.600- 03:09.760* :  We hear from our correspondent in Israel about the decision to target Mr Nasrallah and from Beirut
*03:09.760- 03:14.480* :  about what his death could mean for the movement, who would replace him and how will
*03:14.480- 03:19.560* :  Hisbalah's back a Iran react. This voice from the streets of Tehran is clear on that.
*03:20.640- 03:26.240* :  The message is clear, revenge and revenge. The patience of the people is coming to an end,
*03:26.560- 03:28.220* :  and we want nothing but revenge.
*03:29.200- 03:35.060* :  Also in this special edition of the Global News Podcast, we look at the prospect of a wider regional war.
*03:39.180- 03:43.780* :  Hisbalah has confirmed that Israel killed its veteran leader Hassan Nasrallah
*03:44.180- 03:48.760* :  in a strike on its headquarters in the Lebanese capital Beirut on Friday.
*03:49.520- 03:54.440* :  In a lengthy statement, the Iranian-backed group described him as a martyr and vowed to continue
*03:54.440- 04:00.000* :  its battle against Israel. Daniel Haggari of the Israeli Defence Forces explained the reason for
*04:00.000- 04:09.680* :  the killing. They got together at an underground center under a residential building from which
*04:10.480- 04:14.100* :  they led, designed and commanded the war shearing against Israel.
*04:14.800- 04:22.500* :  Nasrallah is responsible for the murder and abduction of civilians and soldiers from Israel and
*04:22.500- 04:29.000* :  other places in the world. He is one of Israel's biggest enemies throughout history and was a
*04:29.000- 04:35.200* :  threat to Israel for decades, and his killing is making the world a better, safer place.
*04:36.020- 04:40.560* :  And the battles go on, even after the death of Hassan Nasrallah, for the latest,
*04:40.560- 04:46.260* :  his John Donnerson in Jerusalem. There have been dozens of rockets fired into Northern Israel
*04:46.780- 04:51.500* :  this morning, and actually in the moments after Israel announced it had killed Hassan Nasrallah,
*04:51.900- 04:57.440* :  we heard loud explosions as far south as here in Jerusalem, and on the horizon I could see
*04:57.440- 05:06.980* :  what looked like, as well as the rockets being intercepted by the Israel's iron dome missile
*05:06.980- 05:13.760* :  defence shield. So certainly they have given some sort of response this morning. The question is,
*05:14.480- 05:20.300* :  as we've been hearing, where does it go from here? Does the death of Hassan Nasrallah change
*05:20.300- 05:27.280* :  if at all? What Israel does next? I don't think it does, to be honest, because I think Israel
*05:27.280- 05:34.500* :  clearly feels that it has the boot on the throat of Hezbollah at the moment, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*05:34.500- 05:41.100* :  Israel's leader, has said that he is determined to allow those 60,000 Israeli citizens to return
*05:41.100- 05:46.680* :  to their homes in the north, and he is determined to defeat Hezbollah. So there have been
*05:46.680- 05:52.660* :  continued airstrikes today, as you were suggesting from those videos you are looking at in Beirut,
*05:53.100- 05:59.220* :  into Lebanon today, from Israel, and I think that is going to continue. I think it's significant,
*05:59.220- 06:04.860* :  though, because up until this point, Israel has made the calculation throughout all the war in
*06:04.860- 06:10.500* :  Gaza, and with this growing escalation in violence on its northern board with Lebanon, that Iran,
*06:10.500- 06:18.180* :  who, of course, backs, founded, funds, gives weapons to Hezbollah, did not want to get involved
*06:18.180- 06:24.300* :  directly in a wider regional war. Well, the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah is going to put
*06:24.300- 06:29.600* :  that theory to the test, I think, in the coming days and weeks. Our correspondent, John Donerson,
*06:29.600- 06:36.380* :  speaking to my colleague, Rob Young, or plumes of smoke continue to rise above Beirut at thousands
*06:36.380- 06:43.100* :  of residents flee their homes. Our correspondent, Lena Sinjab, is there? The people of Dahyeh, who fled
*06:43.100- 06:50.340* :  Dahyeh this morning after the airstrikes, they are stretched out in almost every street in Beirut,
*06:50.700- 06:58.400* :  on the seaside, in central town, in downtown. So, I mean, even where I am, I could hear the
*06:58.840- 07:05.940* :  cries and the yelling of people following the confirmation from Hezbollah on the death of
*07:06.260- 07:12.680* :  Nasrallah. So, of course, you know, the Shia community, the supporters of Hezbollah are in
*07:12.680- 07:20.120* :  complete shock. He is a big figure for them, and he represents the strength, the unity, he
*07:20.120- 07:26.540* :  represents, you know, fighting Israel for them, despite the prices that they've been paying
*07:26.540- 07:34.680* :  repeatedly because of Hezbollah's involvement in, you know, violence and hostilities with Israel.
*07:35.260- 07:41.900* :  But at the same time, I think the whole country is very cautiously waiting in anticipation to see
*07:41.900- 07:47.860* :  what's going to happen next. This is big news. He is not an ordinary person. He's someone who
*07:48.260- 07:53.940* :  was almost the decision maker of the fate of the whole country. They are in the party,
*07:53.940- 08:02.220* :  they are in every corner of the structure of the state. So, you know, any uncalculated reaction
*08:02.220- 08:09.620* :  from people who disliked Hezbollah might turn things on the ground into really hostility on an
*08:09.620- 08:14.760* :  internal level. These are really crucial times in Lebanon, crucial times in terms with what
*08:14.760- 08:20.160* :  Israel wanted to do next and crucial time in the region as well because Hezbollah don't forget
*08:20.160- 08:24.760* :  they have presence in Syria, they have presence here, they have presence in Yemen, they have
*08:24.760- 08:31.340* :  presence in Iraq. So, you know, I think everyone among leadership in Hezbollah, whoever is left
*08:31.340- 08:38.640* :  of the leadership of Hezbollah will be recalculating their moves wherever communication is available.
*08:38.640- 08:45.420* :  Don't forget that, you know, last week is blow of the page. Issue have disconnected their
*08:45.420- 08:51.500* :  communication among the leadership. So, they are really hit hard from, you know, the heart of
*08:51.500- 08:57.980* :  the organization, but now also the head of the organization is eliminated. These are very crucial
*08:57.980- 09:03.380* :  times, crucial times for, you know, Lebanon and for the safety of the country internally
*09:03.380- 09:10.360* :  and in terms of its, you know, the situation with the Israeli intentions to continue with this
*09:10.360- 09:18.560* :  attack against the group. Lina Sinjab, let's hear more now on Hassan Nasrallah. He'd not been seen
*09:18.560- 09:24.140* :  in public for years because of fears of being assassinated by Israel and was one of the best known
*09:24.140- 09:29.200* :  and most influential figures in the Middle East. The BBC's Middle East regional editor,
*09:29.200- 09:35.680* :  Mike Thompson, looks back over his life. He was one of 10 children born in East Beirut to a family
*09:35.680- 09:40.740* :  that wasn't actually particularly religious. It's thought, although he himself was and from 16
*09:40.740- 09:48.080* :  years old, he immersed himself in religious studies, traveled to Iraq, went to Iran, and then he came
*09:48.080- 09:54.480* :  back and joined Hisbalah soon after Israel's invasion of Lebanon. And in fact, he was largely
*09:54.480- 10:01.820* :  credited by many with Israel's pullout many years later and became revered right across the
*10:01.820- 10:10.320* :  Shia Muslim world. And under his leadership, the group grew massively and became really, he was
*10:10.500- 10:14.880* :  perhaps the most powerful figure in the country by the end of it as their numbers grew and their
*10:14.880- 10:21.140* :  weaponry grew. And the weaponry grew largely off the backing of Iran. We've had the first remarks
*10:21.140- 10:29.020* :  from Iran's supreme leader, Ertala Hamane said, we condemn the killing of the defenseless people
*10:29.020- 10:34.760* :  of Lebanon. It proved the short-sightedness and foolish policies of the leaders of Israel. It's
*10:34.760- 10:40.300* :  incumbent upon all Muslims to stand by the people of Lebanon and the proud Hisbalah movement.
*10:40.500- 10:49.900* :  All eyes are on Iran to see how they react and how in turn, Hisbalah reacts to the killing
*10:49.900- 10:58.020* :  of Mr Nasrullah. What is the capacity of Hisbalah now, even though we've seen two weeks of the
*10:58.020- 11:02.760* :  gradation military and throughout the leadership? What's its capacity to respond now?
*11:03.220- 11:08.340* :  Well, I think that the capacity of Hisbalah is still pretty strong. Although, as you say,
*11:08.340- 11:15.340* :  we've seen so many of their senior commanders assassinated by the communication devices incident
*11:15.340- 11:20.940* :  by several air strikes and, of course, most notably the death of their leader. But nonetheless,
*11:20.940- 11:28.840* :  this is a group with an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles. And some of these missiles are
*11:29.560- 11:34.520* :  quite effective at long range. You could hit virtually any target in Israel and potentially,
*11:34.580- 11:40.340* :  if they couldn't be knocked out by the Israeli forces, could cause quite serious damage and
*11:40.340- 11:44.260* :  loss of life in Israel. And Mike, I suppose, before we go on, we should differentiate
*11:44.260- 11:49.940* :  Hisbalah, which is a military, a political, and a social movement from Lebanon, because there
*11:49.940- 11:56.380* :  is a Lebanese army, isn't there? 70,000 strong. How does that fit into the mix if at all?
*11:56.780- 12:02.160* :  Well, Lebanese government has said that if Israel does launch a ground offensive, that would then
*12:02.160- 12:08.200* :  involve the Lebanese army proper, although it has to be said that Hisbalah is thought to be
*12:08.200- 12:13.340* :  actually more powerful and better armed than the Lebanese army. But nonetheless, there is a
*12:13.340- 12:18.800* :  significant number of soldiers in the Lebanese army. So that would be another thing that Israel
*12:18.800- 12:24.540* :  would have to deal with if it did launch this potential ground, possible ground offensive.
*12:25.080- 12:30.720* :  Mike Thompson. This is a special edition of the Global News Podcast. Hisbalah has confirmed that
*12:30.720- 12:37.200* :  its leader Hassan Nasrallah has been killed in an Israeli air strike. Now, without Iran,
*12:37.200- 12:42.320* :  Hisbalah's influence and military strength would be minimal. The Shia organization has been
*12:42.320- 12:47.880* :  used by Tehran for decades to project its power across the region. Anti-Israeli protesters
*12:47.880- 12:53.480* :  have gathered in the Iranian capital Tehran in support of Hisbalah. One of the demonstrators,
*12:53.480- 12:58.000* :  Mohamed Musavi, said he wanted revenge for Israel's latest actions.
*13:01.700- 13:07.880* :  The message is clear, revenge and revenge. The patience of the people is coming to an end,
*13:08.200- 13:13.580* :  and we want nothing but revenge. And if there's any chance that the news of the martyrdom of Hassan
*13:13.580- 13:18.780* :  Nasrallah is true, it's no different from the martyrdom of General Soleimani. It will cause us
*13:18.780- 13:24.960* :  the same anger towards Israel, and it will only bring Israel's end closer for us. There must be
*13:24.960- 13:29.440* :  an answer, and it must be very soon because I don't think people can wait any longer.
*13:30.080- 13:34.900* :  Well, for years, the Iranian military has trained hisbalah fighters and also sent rockets and
*13:34.900- 13:41.360* :  missiles to Lebanon to fire at targets in Israel. Money has also flooded into its proxy over the years.
*13:42.100- 13:48.280* :  I asked Sivash Adeland from our Persian service, just how important Hassan Nasrallah was to the
*13:48.280- 13:53.940* :  Iranians. We've had a response, a communique that was issued by Iran's Supreme Leader,
*13:53.940- 13:59.220* :  a very underwhelming, given what's been happening. No mention of Hassan Nasrallah's killing
*13:59.220- 14:06.300* :  in the IDF attack. He is simply assuring his audience that Israel will lose in Lebanon as it did
*14:06.300- 14:12.580* :  in Gaza. Obviously, a disappointment for a lot of Iranian heartliners who have been calling for
*14:12.580- 14:18.760* :  Iran to get involved in this. They understand, of course, the importance and significant of his
*14:18.780- 14:24.980* : balah as a force of deterrence for Iran. I mean, this was a group. It was not just meant there to be
*14:24.980- 14:31.440* :  an actor in Lebanon, but also to swing into action if ever there was a confrontation between Iran
*14:31.440- 14:36.100* :  and Israel, and then Israel decided to, let's say, launch attacks against Iran's nuclear
*14:36.100- 14:42.680* :  installations. It was always thought that hisbalah would then swing into action and unleash its
*14:42.680- 14:48.820* :  arsenal of weapons against Israel. So they understand the significance of this loss. Nevertheless,
*14:48.900- 14:55.320* :  Iranian IRGC officials, many of whom have trained hisbalah, who know this organization very well,
*14:56.120- 15:01.720* :  are saying in various interviews that hisbalah will not be damaged because of this,
*15:01.900- 15:06.920* :  that there are other people that will replace it. There are lots of moving parts to this story,
*15:06.920- 15:12.800* :  and the news of Nasrallah's death has been met with raw emotion in downtown Beirut.
*15:13.240- 15:19.140* :  I spoke to Nafi Sir Khanavad, also from the BBC's Persian service, who's there to give me a
*15:19.140- 15:24.420* :  sense of what it's like right now on the streets of the Lebanese capital. We are actually right now in
*15:24.420- 15:31.160* :  downtown Beirut, where many families who fled last night from Dahia spend their nights,
*15:31.800- 15:38.140* :  night here in a park, and they are still here, so desperate. They don't know when they can go
*15:38.140- 15:44.480* :  back home. They don't have any, some of them, they don't have a place to go back. So, and right now
*15:44.480- 15:51.620* :  that I'm talking to you, there is three other, three other explosion heard from Dahia. So it seems
*15:51.620- 15:58.920* :  that Israel is still attacking Dahia. This is the situation, and a while ago I saw a few families
*15:58.920- 16:03.800* :  leaving in a van. I asked them where they are going. They were Syrian families, and among them
*16:03.800- 16:10.100* :  also Lebanese families, that they are going back to Syria because they think Syria is now safer
*16:10.660- 16:15.540* :  than Beirut. And other part of the city that has nothing to do with hisbalah also,
*16:16.600- 16:24.360* :  until morning, everyone heard explosion after explosion. So you can imagine what kind of a state
*16:24.360- 16:31.380* :  of like, what is the mood here, because my, my neighbor, for example last night, texted me that
*16:31.800- 16:38.880* :  Beirut is becoming another Gaza, and we live in a Christian area, but we still could hear massive
*16:38.880- 16:45.440* :  explosions, as if that is happening near us. It's important to note, isn't it, that there are many
*16:45.440- 16:51.300* :  people caught up in the situation in Lebanon, who not only don't support hisbalah, but who are
*16:51.300- 16:58.740* :  actively hostile to them. Yes, and they are, they are so angry because they blame hisbalah that
*16:58.740- 17:09.680* :  hisbalah took Lebanon, not only itself, to avoid Israel, and the thing is that even that view,
*17:09.900- 17:17.400* :  we could sense among people that fled from Dahid, people that fled from Sadr and Lebanon,
*17:17.400- 17:23.420* :  which we spent the last few days with them in a school that they took refuge in Beirut.
*17:23.760- 17:31.580* :  And many of them told us that despite they are supporting Palestinians, and also they are supporting
*17:31.580- 17:37.760* :  Gaza, but they, they don't see it as their war, some of them they told us. Of course, some of them
*17:37.760- 17:43.480* :  were supporting hisbalah fully, but many of them told us that they don't see that it was a war
*17:43.480- 17:48.960* :  that they should pay a price for that. That was Nafisa Konevard from the BBC Persian service,
*17:49.920- 17:54.700* :  as we've been hearing, the death of the hisbalah chief Hassan Nasrallah has been confirmed,
*17:54.740- 18:00.460* :  sending shockwaves throughout the region. Here's our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Asha,
*18:00.980- 18:06.020* :  on what is a very significant moment for the Middle East? Well, I mean, you look towards Iran,
*18:06.020- 18:12.720* :  obviously. Iran had promised after the killing of the Hamas leader, Ismail Hanir, in Tehran,
*18:13.260- 18:18.220* :  a couple of months ago now that it would exact a very, very strong revenge on Israel,
*18:18.220- 18:22.820* :  although Israel has never confirmed it carried out that attack. It hasn't done so, essentially.
*18:23.400- 18:31.500* :  This is the moment you would think when it's absolute key ally, Hassan Nasrallah, in the region,
*18:31.500- 18:37.340* :  it's dual, essentially, of all its proxies, of all its forces, of its foreign strategy,
*18:37.340- 18:44.580* :  essentially, has been severely damaged, wounded, almost put out of action. The Israeli army has put
*18:44.580- 18:51.140* :  out a graphic showing all the top leadership of Hassan Nasrallah now, saying that they've been
*18:51.140- 18:56.680* :  eliminated last week, the pager attack, the communications essentially down. So,
*18:57.480- 19:02.980* :  it, I mean, Hassan Nasrallah, whatever it may be doing publicly, and the fact that it can still
*19:02.980- 19:09.400* :  fire missiles, rockets, as it has done since the attack on Friday evening, but appears to have
*19:09.400- 19:14.900* :  killed Hassan Nasrallah, has still carried out those attacks, but nowhere near the force that has
*19:14.900- 19:20.600* :  been threatened, would Iran now tell Hassan Nasrallah what is left of Hassan Nasrallah, what abilities
*19:20.600- 19:29.520* :  it still has to unleash its capability, would Iran itself be comfortable in taking Israel and
*19:29.520- 19:35.460* :  potentially the US on in a direct conflict? I think the thinking behind that would still be
*19:36.040- 19:41.060* :  no. In Lebanon itself, internally, I think this is a very dangerous moment, there are many there who
*19:41.840- 19:46.620* :  are against Hassan Nasrallah for all sorts of reasons, and will to some extent at least privately
*19:46.620- 19:51.360* :  be celebrating the death of Hassan Nasrallah, but at the same time, they're not only fearing
*19:51.360- 19:56.680* :  what may happen in terms of how Hassan Nasrallah reacts, how Iran reacts, and what Israel will do next,
*19:56.680- 20:03.600* :  but also their own country. Hassan Nasrallah has been the key figure in Lebanon for years,
*20:03.600- 20:09.380* :  politically, militarily. He's now removed, Hasbullah is weakened, there's a power vacuum.
*20:10.320- 20:14.900* :  Lebanon remains fragile in many, many ways, but it remains fragile even in the way that it was
*20:14.900- 20:21.160* :  during the civil war. There are still the different factions, the different groups, and there is
*20:21.160- 20:26.980* :  a possibility that the unrest that we've seen arise from time to time, internally, could return
*20:26.980- 20:32.660* :  without Hasbullah being able to have that central role anymore, even though many there will
*20:32.660- 20:39.820* :  celebrate its weakness. Well, Hasbullah has vowed to continue its fight against Israel.
*20:40.560- 20:45.600* :  Israel says the death of Hassan Nasrallah has dealt a blow to the group and made the world
*20:45.600- 20:50.740* :  a safer place. So let's get the thoughts now of our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
*20:51.840- 20:57.060* :  It's a huge moment, it's a huge moment because of the stature of the man among his followers and
*20:57.060- 21:03.620* :  the fact that for Israel he has been in so many ways, public enemy number one for a very long time.
*21:04.380- 21:09.720* :  He presided over Hasbullah as it was built into a very formidable fighting force with the help
*21:09.720- 21:17.500* :  of Iran. It made the occupation of Israel in the 1980s and 90s so difficult for the Israelis that
*21:17.980- 21:27.960* :  in 2000 they pulled out. 2006 there was a war which in which they fought Israel pretty much to
*21:27.960- 21:34.020* :  a standstill. Since then he has been more of a controversial figure inside Lebanon because
*21:34.580- 21:40.660* :  Hasbullah has been seen, it used to be seen, 2006 he was seen as a national hero by many people,
*21:42.140- 21:51.060* :  but then Hasbullah became rather over mighty, cruel, difficult, oppressive and that made him
*21:51.220- 21:55.740* :  less popular among people who weren't part of his true faithful. But you know these Israelis
*21:55.740- 22:03.320* :  are cock-a-hoop about this because this is a man who they saw as an absolute symbol of all those
*22:03.320- 22:11.620* :  people who are out to destroy them, Iran and its allies and they see this correctly as an
*22:11.620- 22:18.460* :  enormous blow to that Iran-led alliance. It's an enormous blow, is it a decisive blow or does it
*22:18.760- 22:24.980* :  in reality not change much on the conflict that is taking place? Well we don't know really, I mean
*22:24.980- 22:31.280* :  it's getting slightly into the realms of speculation to try and predict the way things will go but
*22:31.280- 22:36.980* :  I think what we can say is that they are not about to surrender his banner and these Israelis have
*22:36.980- 22:43.980* :  reflected that because there's just been a briefing by the army, the Israeli army in which they announced
*22:45.300- 22:49.920* :  that they are banning public gatherings of more than 1,000 people, that they're telling people
*22:49.920- 22:56.360* :  to be careful, stay close to their shelters so they clearly are expecting some kind of a response,
*22:56.880- 23:03.820* :  a fierce one potentially, but I think from the other side from those commanders who remain in
*23:03.820- 23:11.140* :  his banner and the adopted younger generation who will rise up to take some of these posts since so
*23:11.140- 23:18.480* :  many of the senior figures have been killed in the last few months. They might with the Iranians
*23:18.480- 23:23.980* :  think well hang on a minute, if we try and just throw everything at Israel, they'll just hit us
*23:23.980- 23:29.100* :  even harder and maybe even the Americans will get involved so they don't want that, they might try
*23:29.920- 23:33.720* :  a more clever response but now I'm getting to the realm's speculation because I have no idea
*23:33.720- 23:38.380* :  really what's going through their heads except I think what we have to know, what we must realize
*23:38.420- 23:45.060* :  is they will be reeling now from an absolutely seismic blow. And we're going to hear an Iranian voice
*23:45.060- 23:48.820* :  in just a moment because there are so many questions about what if when it comes to the response
*23:48.820- 23:54.640* :  of various countries and various groups and all the while the West is apparently powerless despite
*23:54.640- 23:59.540* :  the US providing the weapons and the planes that were probably used in that attack on Beirut.
*24:01.160- 24:07.980* :  Well the Americans, backed by their Western allies, had a different scenario, not all our war in
*24:07.980- 24:15.220* :  Lebanon and perhaps in a wider part of the region but their plan, which they've been trying to
*24:15.700- 24:21.740* :  make happen over, well really the last year, is to have a political agreement and they've had
*24:21.740- 24:26.580* :  an envoy in the region, a political agreement based on the the U.S. Security Council Resolution
*24:26.580- 24:35.420* :  1701 that ended the 2006 war in which his brother would have to retreat from the Israeli border
*24:35.420- 24:44.080* :  and stop attacking Israel and the Nasrallah while he was alive had said that their attacks on Israel
*24:44.080- 24:50.400* :  would continue until there was a ceasefire in Lebanon so perhaps by calling for sorry a ceasefire
*24:50.400- 24:57.100* :  in Gaza I beg your pardon so perhaps by calling for that 21-day truth which even yesterday the
*24:57.100- 25:03.760* :  United Nations they were hoping that perhaps Prime Minister Netanyahu would go towards accepting it
*25:03.940- 25:09.020* :  which of course he didn't but I think they were hoping that if there was a 21-day
*25:09.020- 25:14.700* :  window of opportunity for the diplomats you never know they might get close to a Gaza ceasefire
*25:15.020- 25:20.300* :  had they done that his brother might have ceased fire themselves would have given them a face-saving
*25:20.300- 25:26.040* :  way out but instead the Israelis have thought well that's not acceptable like a mass they don't
*25:26.040- 25:31.680* :  really they don't want a ceasefire at the moment in Gaza and so they have gotten very very hard
*25:32.180- 25:38.000* :  and they will be padding themselves on the back for inflicting some absolutely grievous blows
