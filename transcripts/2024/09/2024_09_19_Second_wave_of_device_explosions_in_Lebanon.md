*00:16.880- 00:21.600* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.600- 00:22.940* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:23.360- 00:23.980* :  They said yes.
*00:24.360- 00:28.880* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts, they said,
*00:28.880- 00:30.740* :  what the f**k are you talking about?
*00:30.780- 00:32.340* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.

*01:20.080- 01:23.580* :  I'm Andrew Feigean in the early hours of Thursday the 19th of September.
*01:23.580- 01:24.880* :  These are our main stories.
*01:24.900- 01:29.560* :  Israel's Defence Minister says the focus of its year-long war is moving north
*01:29.560- 01:33.820* :  with an army division that was recently in Gaza, moving to the border with Lebanon.
*01:34.380- 01:37.520* :  The comments came after another day of explosions across Lebanon,
*01:37.520- 01:40.720* :  this time involving walkie talkies used by Hezbollah.
*01:41.500- 01:45.340* :  The US Federal Reserve has cut its lending rate by half a percentage point.
*01:45.340- 01:47.460* :  It's first reduction in four years.
*01:50.380- 01:51.260* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:51.340- 01:55.640* :  I felt all strong, grasped, and didn't want to let go.
*01:56.300- 01:58.160* :  And I tried to get off of it once myself.
*01:58.800- 01:59.520* :  Well, I couldn't.
*01:59.660- 02:03.340* :  While the US state of Oregon is recriminalizing drugs like fentanyl,
*02:03.620- 02:06.040* :  just four years after they were decriminalized.
*02:10.160- 02:13.620* :  Now, just 24 hours ago, we were reporting that 12 people had been killed
*02:13.620- 02:18.460* :  and 3,000 had been injured after handheld pages used by Hezbollah fighters
*02:19.060- 02:20.520* :  exploded in Lebanon on Tuesday.
*02:21.180- 02:24.960* :  Then on Wednesday, as some of the dead were buried, there were more explosions.
*02:24.980- 02:29.020* :  This time it was walkie talkies, bought by Hezbollah a few months ago
*02:29.280- 02:30.820* :  at the same time as the pages.
*02:31.320- 02:34.320* :  20 more people died, 450 were injured.
*02:34.980- 02:38.220* :  Now, Israel's Defence Minister has said the focus of its year-long war
*02:38.220- 02:41.520* :  is moving north with an army division that was recently in Gaza,
*02:41.980- 02:43.380* :  moving to the border with Lebanon.
*02:43.980- 02:46.340* :  Here's a recording of one of the blasts on Wednesday,
*02:46.340- 02:48.900* :  posted by LBCI News in Lebanon.
*02:56.280- 02:59.960* :  The FISA code of art of BBC Persian was in Beirut for the few rules
*02:59.960- 03:01.420* :  of those who died on Tuesday.
*03:02.000- 03:02.940* :  Here's what she told me.
*03:03.820- 03:07.760* :  While we were there, we heard quite a strong explosion
*03:08.400- 03:12.080* :  and we found out that the explosion happened not far from us.
*03:12.740- 03:18.500* :  Inside one of the ambulances that was parked near the Puneau area.
*03:19.080- 03:24.820* :  And then right after, again, Hezbollah opium members tried to manage this
*03:24.960- 03:25.560* :  at the atmosphere.
*03:25.560- 03:27.700* :  They asked people to calm down.
*03:28.280- 03:34.980* :  And then after that, we heard other explosions and news started to become
*03:35.600- 03:41.280* :  that again, a new wave of explosions happening across Lebanon
*03:41.280- 03:46.420* :  and especially in Dahia, which is controlled by Hezbollah and it was there.
*03:46.860- 03:52.460* :  We were at for funeral of three members of Hezbollah that were killed yesterday
*03:52.460- 03:59.840* :  in these explosions and an 11-year-old boy that lost his life again
*03:59.840- 04:01.380* :  because of these explosions.
*04:01.700- 04:05.660* :  And give me a sense of what people's reaction was at the time.
*04:05.660- 04:07.160* :  No one's expecting this.
*04:07.160- 04:10.540* :  There are a funeral mourning people who died only yesterday.
*04:10.540- 04:14.120* :  How did they react to the sound of the explosion that you heard?
*04:14.440- 04:17.180* :  For a few seconds, of course, there was panic.
*04:17.720- 04:23.200* :  And you could see that there was a shock in everyone's face from yesterday.
*04:23.780- 04:27.540* :  And that explosion sound made everyone panic for a few seconds.
*04:28.020- 04:31.940* :  But then after that, because it was funeral, everyone said, continued
*04:32.400- 04:33.920* :  as if that nothing was happening.
*04:33.920- 04:38.080* :  But you could feel that that atmosphere is not normal.
*04:38.720- 04:42.320* :  Everyone was waiting for something bigger
*04:42.800- 04:44.760* :  and some people decided to leave.
*04:45.140- 04:48.780* :  And what about people's reaction as the news started to spread
*04:49.600- 04:52.160* :  that this was another wave of attacks
*04:52.180- 04:55.360* :  with it happening in lots of lots of different places like yesterday?
*04:55.960- 04:56.220* :  Shock.
*04:57.040- 04:57.980* :  Everyone is shocked.
*04:58.260- 05:01.200* :  You could see in everyone's face.
*05:01.720- 05:06.300* :  And it's not only people close to Hezbollah or Hezbollah members.
*05:06.880- 05:10.140* :  I can tell you from the reaction that we see on social media
*05:10.920- 05:15.080* :  and the reactions from even on Hezbollah figures
*05:15.080- 05:21.060* :  that now kind of sounding solidarity with the group, not with the group,
*05:21.420- 05:25.020* :  just because of the scale of what happened yesterday.
*05:25.780- 05:30.460* :  Even those that are against Hezbollah sounded more positive
*05:30.460- 05:33.280* :  and they said that they are supporting people
*05:33.280- 05:36.700* :  that were affected in these wavels attack.
*05:36.700- 05:39.780* :  But of course, the new wave of attack
*05:39.780- 05:40.980* :  is more worrying.
*05:41.420- 05:44.160* :  It is a sign that something bigger
*05:44.160- 05:45.400* :  and what can make happen.
*05:46.080- 05:48.700* :  My colleague Nafisa Kanovaar, of BBC Persian,
*05:49.220- 05:52.300* :  the attacks of renewed fears of an escalation of the conflict
*05:52.300- 05:55.000* :  that we discussed by the UN Security Council.
*05:55.580- 05:59.000* :  World leaders have been responding in a reversal of his position
*05:59.100- 06:01.940* :  before the Gaza war, Saudi Arabia's crown prince,
*06:01.940- 06:05.240* :  Mohammed bin Salman, said his country would never normalize
*06:05.240- 06:08.640* :  ties with Israel unless an independent Palestinian state
*06:08.640- 06:09.420* :  were established.
*06:10.120- 06:11.620* :  As we heard in our earlier podcast,
*06:11.620- 06:14.040* :  Iran called the blasts mass murder.
*06:14.620- 06:16.760* :  Speaking in Egypt, after the first attack,
*06:16.760- 06:18.800* :  America's top diplomat, Anthony Blinken,
*06:19.140- 06:21.280* :  said Washington had had no prior knowledge
*06:21.280- 06:22.420* :  of what was going to happen.
*06:22.940- 06:26.160* :  But as our State Department correspondent Tom Beatman now explains,
*06:26.180- 06:28.600* :  the US later changed its tune.
*06:29.440- 06:31.060* :  That message has been tweaked a bit,
*06:31.420- 06:33.400* :  I have to say, in the last few hours,
*06:33.820- 06:36.420* :  with officials briefing anonymously
*06:36.420- 06:39.160* :  that in fact, they did have some advance warning
*06:39.160- 06:42.460* :  in that the Pentagon was told by the Israelis,
*06:42.740- 06:43.820* :  according to these briefings,
*06:44.380- 06:48.080* :  that the Israelis were going to do something in Lebanon yesterday,
*06:48.080- 06:51.380* :  but they didn't give any details of what that operation was.
*06:51.820- 06:53.900* :  It's a slightly bizarre mission, this, I think,
*06:53.900- 06:55.860* :  because it just begs the question,
*06:55.860- 06:57.840* :  well, why didn't the Americans ask them
*06:57.840- 07:01.780* :  what they plan to do when this piece of information was given to them?
*07:01.980- 07:04.340* :  So I think that will be the focus of a lot more questions
*07:04.920- 07:09.000* :  for the Pentagon and the State Department over the next day or two.
*07:09.340- 07:11.480* :  There's been no official comment from Israel.
*07:11.480- 07:14.760* :  A diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams, is in Jerusalem.
*07:15.720- 07:17.960* :  Several theories have been circulating since yesterday
*07:17.960- 07:21.180* :  about the timing of these mass attacks on his Bollar members.
*07:21.780- 07:25.200* :  One is that Israel chose this moment to send a devastating message
*07:25.200- 07:27.360* :  to the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia,
*07:27.780- 07:29.880* :  following a gradual escalation of violence
*07:29.880- 07:31.520* :  along Israel's northern border.
*07:32.140- 07:34.580* :  The other is that Israel did not necessarily mean
*07:34.580- 07:37.560* :  to put this highly ambitious plan in motion just now,
*07:37.920- 07:40.140* :  but found its hand forced by the possibility
*07:40.140- 07:42.100* :  the plot was about to be exposed.
*07:42.920- 07:44.860* :  After today's second round of explosions,
*07:44.860- 07:47.060* :  both explanations are still possible,
*07:47.640- 07:50.720* :  but more than ever, this feels like a concerted effort by Israel
*07:50.720- 07:53.820* :  to cripple his Bollar literally and figuratively.
*07:54.520- 07:58.600* :  With all pages and handheld radios now seen as potentially lethal devices,
*07:59.120- 08:01.440* :  his Bollar's ability to communicate with itself
*08:01.440- 08:03.360* :  is being dramatically eroded.
*08:04.120- 08:06.060* :  Israel may be hoping that by demonstrating
*08:06.060- 08:09.320* :  just how compromised his Bollar's communications are,
*08:09.780- 08:12.660* :  the group will hesitate or find it simply too difficult
*08:12.660- 08:16.640* :  to launch any further cross-border attacks, at least for now.
*08:17.320- 08:19.100* :  Or, Israel is preparing the ground,
*08:19.100- 08:21.160* :  assiduously and terrifyingly,
*08:21.500- 08:24.100* :  for its own major operation inside Lebanon.
*08:24.660- 08:28.440* :  Not all Israelis are convinced such an escalation would be a good idea.
*08:29.040- 08:30.720* :  An opinion Paul published last night
*08:30.720- 08:33.220* :  suggested that 52 percent of Israelis
*08:33.720- 08:35.400* :  favored a wider war in Lebanon,
*08:35.420- 08:39.660* :  but 30 percent were against, with 18 percent undecided.
*08:40.560- 08:43.560* :  One big question is where the pages used by his Bollar
*08:43.560- 08:47.080* :  and targeted on Tuesday and the walkie talkies came from,
*08:47.380- 08:47.960* :  who made them.
*08:48.340- 08:50.700* :  They were carrying the branding of a Taiwanese company,
*08:50.700- 08:53.360* :  Gold Apollo, but that's not where the trail ends.
*08:54.080- 08:56.480* :  Our Asia correspondent, Rupert Wingfield Hayes,
*08:56.480- 08:57.680* :  has more on what we know.
*08:58.760- 09:00.940* :  I am fairly sure that before today,
*09:00.940- 09:04.420* :  very few people anywhere had heard the name Gold Apollo
*09:04.420- 09:07.180* :  or knew of the little Taiwanese company behind it.
*09:07.560- 09:10.620* :  Today, its name has been making headlines around the world
*09:11.040- 09:12.720* :  and for all the wrong reasons.
*09:13.540- 09:16.160* :  It stands accused of being the company that manufactured
*09:16.160- 09:19.460* :  the electronic pages that on Tuesday began exploding
*09:19.460- 09:22.300* :  across Lebanon in during thousands of people.
*09:23.000- 09:25.880* :  At the company's office in a non-descript business park
*09:25.880- 09:28.380* :  in a Thai-based suburb, the atmosphere
*09:28.380- 09:30.540* :  was a mixture of panic and denial.
*09:31.240- 09:32.460* :  This is nothing to do with us,
*09:32.460- 09:34.120* :  the company's founder, Xu Qin Guang,
*09:34.120- 09:37.240* :  told a gaggle of journalists who had turned up at his door.
*09:38.060- 09:39.520* :  Soon he was back with an explanation.
*09:40.220- 09:42.240* :  Those are not our pages, he said.
*09:42.520- 09:45.400* :  We signed an agreement with a company in Europe three years ago
*09:45.400- 09:47.700* :  to use our brand name on their pages.
*09:48.340- 09:50.860* :  The ones in Lebanon must have been made by them.
*09:52.040- 09:54.420* :  It all sounded a little implausible.
*09:55.100- 09:57.260* :  Photos of some of the exploded devices
*09:57.260- 09:59.620* :  clearly showed the Gold Apollo name
*10:00.360- 10:02.600* :  and looked pretty much identical to model
*10:02.600- 10:05.040* :  that until Tuesday had been proudly displayed
*10:05.040- 10:06.860* :  on Mr Xu's company website.
*10:07.700- 10:10.900* :  That website is suddenly impossible to access.
*10:11.900- 10:14.900* :  Still, Mr Xu insisted, and by early afternoon,
*10:14.940- 10:18.480* :  he produced a statement naming the European company
*10:18.540- 10:22.680* :  BAC Consulting and an address in Budapest.
*10:23.500- 10:24.940* :  It took several more hours,
*10:25.300- 10:27.120* :  but eventually an American news network
*10:27.120- 10:31.060* :  managed to track down the CEO of BAC Consulting,
*10:31.480- 10:33.260* :  a young British-educated woman
*10:33.260- 10:37.420* :  who denied her company has ever manufactured any pages.
*10:38.580- 10:40.260* :  And so the plot thickens.
*10:40.780- 10:43.180* :  Tonight a team of investigators left the offices
*10:43.180- 10:46.140* :  of Gold Apollo with boxes of documents
*10:46.920- 10:49.720* :  and many, many questions still to be answered.
*10:50.320- 10:52.840* :  Our Asia correspondent, Rupert Wingfield Hayes.
*10:53.640- 10:54.700* :  Let's move on to other news.
*10:54.700- 10:56.940* :  Now, emergency workers in central Thailand
*10:56.940- 10:59.020* :  have rescued a 64-year-old woman
*10:59.460- 11:01.900* :  from the grip of a huge reticulated python.
*11:02.460- 11:04.040* :  Police broke down the woman's door
*11:04.040- 11:06.180* :  after a neighbor heard her calling for help.
*11:06.620- 11:07.960* :  Here's Abigail Maudsley.
*11:08.720- 11:10.880* :  The rescuers were alerted when a neighbor
*11:10.880- 11:13.660* :  heard the woman's faint, exhausted cries.
*11:14.640- 11:17.140* :  They found her on the ground being slowly crushed
*11:17.140- 11:18.860* :  by the four meter long snake.
*11:20.080- 11:21.740* :  It took more than half an hour for them
*11:21.740- 11:23.920* :  to extract her from its powerful coils.
*11:24.520- 11:26.500* :  A widow who lived alone, she said she'd
*11:26.500- 11:29.320* :  been washing dishes behind her house on Tuesday night
*11:29.700- 11:31.860* :  when she felt a sharp pain in her thigh
*11:31.860- 11:36.060* :  as the python sank its teeth in and began to wrap around her.
*11:36.880- 11:39.560* :  She'd been struggling for two harrowing hours
*11:39.560- 11:41.420* :  by the time help arrived.
*11:42.340- 11:44.700* :  A tea company in Shen Zhen has apologized
*11:44.700- 11:46.800* :  and deleted a social media video
*11:47.140- 11:49.580* :  with themes from China's cultural revolution.
*11:50.220- 11:53.580* :  It showed employees of Gooming wearing cardboard posters
*11:53.980- 11:56.240* :  with some of the things they were guilty of at work,
*11:56.240- 11:58.760* :  like forgetting to give a straw to a customer.
*11:59.340- 12:00.700* :  Gooming make milk tea.
*12:00.900- 12:03.080* :  I started by asking our China media analyst,
*12:03.080- 12:04.480* :  Carrie Allen, what that is.
*12:05.320- 12:06.600* :  It can be iced beverages.
*12:06.640- 12:08.460* :  They can have little bubbles in.
*12:08.460- 12:11.260* :  Often they're tea that's got fruit in.
*12:11.840- 12:14.980* :  So it's like a fruity, milky drink.
*12:15.600- 12:18.240* :  There's very popular in China and very popular in Asia as a whole.
*12:18.680- 12:21.600* :  What happens in this video that turns out to be so controversial?
*12:22.480- 12:25.900* :  Well, it shows three employees at one of the stores.
*12:26.360- 12:29.060* :  This company's got more than 9,000 in China.
*12:29.620- 12:33.480* :  And they've got cardboard boards hung over their heads
*12:34.080- 12:35.700* :  with words on, for example, saying,
*12:35.700- 12:39.200* :  I am guilty of not giving a straw to a customer.
*12:39.420- 12:42.160* :  And they're meant to be very tongue in cheek.
*12:42.160- 12:43.560* :  They're meant to be a bit of a joke.
*12:44.320- 12:46.320* :  But the reason this is so controversial
*12:46.320- 12:49.440* :  is because wearing a sign that says, I'm guilty.
*12:50.000- 12:53.440* :  A lot of people in China will think back to the cultural revolution.
*12:53.540- 12:56.380* :  One of the most stark signs during this period,
*12:56.380- 12:58.540* :  this was the 1960s and 70s,
*12:59.120- 13:02.000* :  was people, landlords in particular,
*13:02.000- 13:04.820* :  being publicly shamed wearing big signs
*13:04.820- 13:08.660* :  that say I am guilty of things like capitalism.
*13:09.220- 13:12.980* :  So seeing this social media video instantly makes people think back
*13:12.980- 13:15.300* :  to that time a very controversial time in China.
*13:15.800- 13:18.040* :  I mean, I suppose it's designed to do exactly that.
*13:18.040- 13:20.580* :  It's just something that the authorities in China,
*13:20.580- 13:22.820* :  perhaps people in China are not ready for.
*13:23.960- 13:24.760* :  Well, absolutely.
*13:24.760- 13:27.320* :  And the company, which is one of the biggest
*13:27.320- 13:28.700* :  milk tea companies in China,
*13:28.700- 13:31.040* :  has apologized today saying they didn't anticipate
*13:31.040- 13:33.700* :  the misunderstandings that people would have about this video
*13:33.740- 13:35.920* :  and the discomfort that people would have seeing it.
*13:36.220- 13:38.060* :  Because there are people from around that time
*13:38.100- 13:41.760* :  who they remember it was a very distressing time.
*13:41.760- 13:44.000* :  I mean, seeing people who were beaten up,
*13:44.420- 13:45.760* :  there were public beatings,
*13:46.040- 13:48.500* :  people were imprisoned, there were rapes, torture.
*13:48.500- 13:50.560* :  It was a very, very controversial time.
*13:50.600- 13:53.000* :  And this was just meant to be a bit of fun.
*13:53.000- 13:56.060* :  That's what the employees who made this video said.
*13:56.060- 13:57.740* :  They thought it would just be a bit of fun.
*13:58.140- 13:59.820* :  And there are people on Weibo,
*13:59.860- 14:02.360* :  which is a very popular social media platform in China,
*14:02.360- 14:04.360* :  saying that they think it's a smart campaign.
*14:04.360- 14:05.740* :  They can see the fun in it.
*14:06.180- 14:08.300* :  And it has got a lot of attention as a result,
*14:08.300- 14:10.360* :  even though for a lot of people,
*14:10.360- 14:12.700* :  it is actually quite distressing to see
*14:12.860- 14:15.140* :  and they feel very uncomfortable about seeing it.
*14:15.340- 14:17.480* :  So, yeah, the company has needed to apologize.
*14:18.060- 14:19.820* :  The company said they thought it would be a meme,
*14:19.820- 14:22.060* :  it will be something that people could have a bit of fun with.
*14:22.600- 14:24.320* :  But in their apology today,
*14:24.320- 14:27.600* :  they've simply said, sorry, we messed up big time.
*14:28.060- 14:29.860* :  Our China media analyst, Carrie Allen.
*14:32.660- 14:33.420* :  And still to come.

*14:44.340- 14:48.200* :  or maybe real estate sales on Mars is your profession?
*14:48.200- 14:48.900* :  It doesn't matter.

*15:20.260- 15:21.520* :  Ryan Reynolds here from InMobile.
*15:21.820- 15:23.260* :  With the price of just about everything
*15:23.520- 15:24.660* :  going up during inflation,
*15:24.660- 15:26.820* :  we thought we'd bring our prices down.
*15:27.280- 15:29.840* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer,
*15:29.860- 15:31.080* :  which is apparently a thing.
*15:31.480- 15:33.360* :  Mid-Mobile unlimited premium wireless.
*15:33.360- 15:36.740* :  30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20,
*15:36.740- 15:39.480* :  20, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, just 15 bucks a month.
*15:39.740- 15:43.160* :  So give it a try at mid-mobile.com slash switch.
*15:43.620- 15:45.440* :  $45 upfront for three months plus taxes and fees,
*15:45.540- 15:46.800* :  promulure it for new customers for limited time,
*15:46.860- 15:48.100* :  and the minimum for them 40 gigabytes per month
*15:48.100- 15:49.640* :  slows, full turns at mid-mobile.com.
*15:55.560- 15:58.740* :  At the end of 2020 people in the US West Coast state
*15:58.740- 16:01.000* :  of Oregon voted for a different approach
*16:01.000- 16:02.800* :  to dealing with burgeoning drug abuse.
*16:03.360- 16:06.360* :  More than half gave their backing to a law decriminalizing
*16:06.360- 16:08.500* :  the possession of a small amount of hard drugs
*16:08.500- 16:10.660* :  like fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine.
*16:11.400- 16:13.720* :  Instead of a conviction, users were given a fine,
*16:13.720- 16:16.480* :  much like a speeding ticket, which they could get out of
*16:16.660- 16:17.800* :  if they went into rehab.
*16:18.260- 16:21.040* :  But nearly four years on, that experiment has come to an end.
*16:21.400- 16:22.520* :  From the start of this month,
*16:22.520- 16:24.340* :  possession is once again a crime.
*16:24.820- 16:27.500* :  That's after a public outcry against the number of people
*16:27.500- 16:30.140* :  openly taking drugs and living on the streets.
*16:30.840- 16:32.000* :  James Menendez reports.
*16:32.980- 16:35.780* :  I felt all strong, you know, and that was just a new thing.
*16:36.260- 16:38.980* :  It grasped me and didn't want to let go.
*16:40.780- 16:42.940* :  And I tried to get off of it once myself.
*16:44.140- 16:44.960* :  Well, I couldn't.
*16:45.440- 16:48.520* :  Bill, who's originally from Alaska, tells me he's been
*16:48.520- 16:50.500* :  a drug addict most of his life.
*16:50.500- 16:54.440* :  He's 62, but looks older with a nervous gaze
*16:54.440- 16:57.600* :  that occasionally breaks into a rye, crinkled smile.
*16:58.240- 17:00.200* :  Like when he tells me that he came to Oregon
*17:00.200- 17:02.900* :  because a friend said it was easy to score drugs
*17:02.900- 17:06.700* :  in particular fentanyl coming up the West Coast from Mexico.
*17:07.320- 17:08.260* :  His friend was right.
*17:08.260- 17:09.460* :  It was easy.
*17:09.740- 17:12.540* :  And that sent Bill hurtling into the abyss.
*17:13.300- 17:15.940* :  See, the problem with fentanyl was I couldn't go
*17:15.940- 17:17.500* :  maybe two hours without.
*17:18.540- 17:19.880* :  Were you worried about overdosing?
*17:20.580- 17:22.360* :  No, it didn't, it didn't change anything.
*17:23.080- 17:24.760* :  What were you worried about is running out.
*17:26.340- 17:29.140* :  We've come to downtown Portland now,
*17:29.380- 17:31.120* :  and I've come to talk to Max Williams,
*17:31.140- 17:33.460* :  who was heavily involved in the campaign
*17:33.460- 17:36.920* :  to re-criminalize the possession of hard drugs.
*17:36.920- 17:41.240* :  What was your problem with the moves to decriminalize hard drugs?
*17:41.540- 17:43.560* :  I think it opened up a considerable more
*17:43.560- 17:45.320* :  amount of open-air drug use.
*17:45.320- 17:48.780* :  The consequences that the provisions had allowed
*17:48.780- 17:51.540* :  for a $100 ticket to be written by law enforcement,
*17:51.540- 17:53.140* :  but there was zero enforcement.
*17:53.540- 17:57.220* :  And as a result, we saw increasing amounts of overdoses,
*17:57.900- 18:00.660* :  increased retail crime, and violent crime,
*18:01.000- 18:02.960* :  and people becoming increasingly concerned
*18:02.960- 18:06.580* :  about an almost dystopian feel to Portland's downtown.
*18:07.060- 18:10.860* :  We saw three people openly doing drugs.
*18:11.000- 18:14.220* :  This is a problem that's going to take a while to fix.
*18:14.460- 18:17.180* :  I do think collectively, if you were to ask most people,
*18:17.180- 18:19.520* :  they would say things are trending in the right direction,
*18:19.560- 18:21.400* :  but it's not going to be an overnight success.
*18:25.540- 18:28.400* :  This facility here exists exclusively for individuals
*18:28.400- 18:31.500* :  that require 24, 7,365 medical monitoring,
*18:32.040- 18:33.080* :  or staff of the bathroom.
*18:33.140- 18:35.760* :  One of the benefits of the Portland experiment
*18:35.760- 18:38.340* :  was more funding for the treatment of addiction.
*18:38.820- 18:42.380* :  Paid for, in a neat twist, out of the taxes on sales
*18:42.380- 18:44.180* :  of marijuana, which is legal.
*18:44.580- 18:47.820* :  That money helps set up this detox facility in the city,
*18:47.820- 18:51.340* :  Joe Bazegi, is it direct to, can I ask you this?
*18:51.480- 18:53.040* :  I mean, there is, have been an argument
*18:53.040- 18:57.320* :  that decriminalization caused more overdoses in Portland.
*18:57.880- 19:01.220* :  Your best place to answer whether that's true or not, is it?
*19:01.340- 19:02.220* :  No, it's not true.
*19:02.460- 19:04.880* :  What is true is that the replacement
*19:04.880- 19:08.120* :  of our heroin supply with elicitly manufactured fentanyl
*19:08.120- 19:11.920* :  50 times as strong has spiraled our overdose death rates.
*19:12.420- 19:14.960* :  Measure one time was passed in November of 2020,
*19:15.500- 19:18.060* :  and implemented in February of 21.
*19:18.940- 19:23.820* :  We saw 70% increase in overdose deaths in Oregon in 2020
*19:24.400- 19:25.460* :  before the law was implemented.
*19:25.920- 19:28.500* :  What do you make of the fact that it's being recriminalized?
*19:28.500- 19:29.880* :  What do you think the impact will be?
*19:30.240- 19:32.020* :  People are less likely to engage with treatment
*19:32.360- 19:35.180* :  if they first have to admit to a crime in order to enter
*19:35.180- 19:36.860* :  treatment, so people are afraid,
*19:36.860- 19:40.780* :  because criminality is associated with their health condition.
*19:41.580- 19:44.960* :  Court in the middle of all these arguments, people like Bill,
*19:44.960- 19:48.840* :  who was brought back from the brink, others weren't so lucky.
*19:49.180- 19:53.120* :  Last year in Oregon, nearly 1,400 people died
*19:53.120- 19:58.160* :  from an opioid overdose, a five-fold increase since 2019.
*19:59.180- 19:59.980* :  And how are you feeling now?
*20:00.760- 20:04.180* :  Oh, it's way better to be freed up to where I don't have
*20:04.180- 20:07.700* :  to find a place to hide and smoke, you know?
*20:08.520- 20:09.720* :  That's pretty good.
*20:10.460- 20:13.060* :  So, is it fair to say that this place saved your life?
*20:13.680- 20:14.580* :  Oh, that's way better.
*20:16.240- 20:16.540* :  Yeah.
*20:17.820- 20:19.840* :  And that was Bill, formerly a fentanyl addict,
*20:19.840- 20:22.240* :  ending that report by James Melendez.
*20:23.040- 20:25.320* :  The US Federal Reserve has cut its lending rate
*20:25.320- 20:26.980* :  for the first time in four years.
*20:27.280- 20:29.880* :  The target range has been dropped by half a point
*20:29.880- 20:32.900* :  to between 4.75 and 5%.
*20:33.360- 20:36.180* :  The Fed said it had gained confidence that US inflation
*20:36.180- 20:39.200* :  was moving sustainably towards the target of 2%.
*20:39.660- 20:42.020* :  The chairman of the Federal Reserve is Jerome Powell.
*20:43.060- 20:46.400* :  This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain
*20:46.400- 20:48.400* :  the strength of the economy and the labor market
*20:49.020- 20:51.880* :  and will continue to enable further progress on inflation
*20:52.520- 20:55.780* :  as we begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance.
*20:56.480- 20:58.660* :  We are not on any preset course.
*20:59.480- 21:02.220* :  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.
*21:03.020- 21:05.460* :  This report from our North America business correspondent,
*21:05.460- 21:06.600* :  Ritika Gupta.
*21:07.180- 21:10.320* :  What it's suggesting is that the Fed is concerned
*21:10.320- 21:12.840* :  about the risks of growth to the economy.
*21:12.840- 21:16.620* :  It has that dual mandate of ensuring full employment
*21:17.140- 21:19.260* :  whilst also keeping inflation in target.
*21:19.260- 21:21.940* :  We've seen inflation start to recede, start to moderate.
*21:21.940- 21:24.220* :  The central bank did say expects inflation
*21:24.220- 21:25.680* :  to return to target next year.
*21:25.960- 21:28.660* :  So perhaps it is focusing more on employment
*21:28.660- 21:31.680* :  and any risks to slow a growth for the economy.
*21:32.120- 21:34.480* :  After the announcement, Donald Trump said the rate cut
*21:34.480- 21:36.660* :  showed the US economy was either very bad
*21:37.020- 21:38.180* :  or they're playing politics.
*21:38.880- 21:41.360* :  Just a quick reminder that in the run up to the US presidential
*21:41.360- 21:44.000* :  election in November, we'll be doing a special podcast
*21:44.000- 21:45.780* :  with our friends at BBC America.
*21:46.060- 21:49.140* :  We need your questions, though, to put to our team in the US.
*21:49.660- 21:51.300* :  So if there's anything you'd like to know about
*21:51.300- 21:53.880* :  the Trump Harris contest, do drop us an email,
*21:53.880- 21:58.820* :  globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk, or find us on X
*21:58.820- 22:00.920* :  where we are at global news part.
*22:00.920- 22:04.880* :  And if you can, please record your question as a voice note.
*22:05.980- 22:08.500* :  In 2023, the World Health Organization
*22:08.500- 22:11.620* :  estimated that more than 55 million people across the globe
*22:11.900- 22:15.140* :  had dementia with nearly 10 million new cases every year.
*22:15.840- 22:17.540* :  And of course, it affects everyone differently.
*22:17.960- 22:20.720* :  The journalist, Amthea Rowan, has written about her experience
*22:20.720- 22:24.220* :  of her mother's dementia in a book called A Silence to Nami.
*22:24.720- 22:27.580* :  As she told Sarah Montague, the first she knew that something was wrong
*22:27.620- 22:30.380* :  was when her mother suddenly stopped recognizing her.
*22:31.220- 22:34.220* :  She said, now tell me, when did we first meet?
*22:34.440- 22:36.480* :  I thought she must be joking, and I laughed,
*22:36.480- 22:39.160* :  but it was very clear by her response that she wasn't joking,
*22:39.460- 22:40.860* :  and that she didn't know who I was.
*22:40.860- 22:44.420* :  I said to her, mum, you've known me my whole life, I'm your daughter.
*22:45.320- 22:47.500* :  And she accepted that with some embarrassment.
*22:48.460- 22:51.560* :  But in the next day, she refuted that furiously.
*22:52.080- 22:53.820* :  I couldn't possibly be her daughter
*22:53.820- 22:56.500* :  because I was much too old to be her daughter.
*22:56.500- 23:00.100* :  At the time, I was just over 50, and she was very nearly 80.
*23:00.860- 23:03.620* :  So I tried to collect photographs together
*23:04.340- 23:07.620* :  and produce this sort of PowerPoint of pictures.
*23:08.080- 23:10.640* :  I produced photographs with her parents and me.
*23:11.300- 23:13.800* :  And my siblings, she knew who my siblings were,
*23:13.840- 23:15.220* :  but she didn't know who I was.
*23:15.900- 23:19.640* :  And you needed to do this, not just because it would be nice
*23:19.640- 23:22.780* :  that your mother knew you were her daughter,
*23:22.780- 23:24.540* :  but also because of the care.
*23:24.820- 23:26.540* :  She wasn't living with me at the time.
*23:26.540- 23:27.960* :  She was staying with me at the time.
*23:28.700- 23:31.400* :  But there were medications that needed to be administered.
*23:32.180- 23:34.600* :  And I just needed her to feel at peace being with me.
*23:35.340- 23:37.120* :  Later on, when she came to live with me,
*23:37.380- 23:39.720* :  and she lived with me for a year and a half before she died,
*23:40.480- 23:42.380* :  there were many times when she didn't know who I was.
*23:42.380- 23:44.400* :  But by then, I'd grown used to it.
*23:44.680- 23:47.320* :  With dementia, they talk about distracting people,
*23:47.320- 23:50.620* :  just constantly appeasing, you never challenge.
*23:50.780- 23:55.600* :  Did you do that at the beginning before you knew fully what you were doing?
*23:55.720- 23:58.160* :  Oh, in the beginning, I stated my position.
*23:58.160- 23:59.600* :  I am your daughter.
*23:59.960- 24:03.000* :  And I continued to state my position most of the time
*24:03.020- 24:04.960* :  when it seemed important to do that.
*24:04.960- 24:09.480* :  For example, when she felt unsafe or where were her people.
*24:10.140- 24:12.020* :  Well, I'm your person, my mom, I'm your daughter.
*24:12.880- 24:16.380* :  But she also disputed the fact that my father had died.
*24:16.380- 24:17.860* :  My father died when we were teenagers.
*24:18.580- 24:20.780* :  And she told me that he had left her.
*24:21.460- 24:23.280* :  And the first time she told me that,
*24:23.280- 24:26.120* :  I said to her, he didn't leave you mum, he died.
*24:27.100- 24:29.280* :  And she said, well, I never knew that.
*24:29.280- 24:30.780* :  Thank you so much for telling me.
*24:31.540- 24:33.480* :  Anyway, he continued to leave her.
*24:34.060- 24:36.160* :  And I continued to state the fact of his dying.
*24:36.160- 24:38.320* :  And till it occurred to me one day to ask her,
*24:38.320- 24:39.140* :  what was better?
*24:39.340- 24:41.240* :  Would it be better to think he died?
*24:41.860- 24:44.280* :  Or would it be better to think that he had left you?
*24:44.840- 24:47.480* :  And she said it would be better to think that he had left me
*24:47.480- 24:48.900* :  because then he might come back.
*24:49.840- 24:52.940* :  And then it occurred to me, sometimes my truth,
*24:53.800- 24:56.400* :  maybe more painful, maybe sometimes her truth,
*24:56.400- 24:59.820* :  whatever fiction she's living in is an easier one to live with.
*25:00.400- 25:02.600* :  When she eventually died, did you think
*25:02.600- 25:06.120* :  I have been actually dealing with this death for some time
*25:06.120- 25:08.040* :  and you've been grieving her?
*25:08.440- 25:09.100* :  Yes, I did.
*25:09.240- 25:12.460* :  They call dementia sort of a slow death
*25:12.460- 25:15.160* :  and a death by 1,000 cuts and all these kinds of things,
*25:15.160- 25:16.940* :  these phrases that they use for it.
*25:17.540- 25:17.960* :  I did.
*25:18.460- 25:21.500* :  And I think the hardest thing when somebody dies from dementia,
*25:21.500- 25:25.160* :  it was four or five years since mum had forgotten me
*25:25.220- 25:25.840* :  when she died.
*25:26.840- 25:30.220* :  But what I'm trying to do now is you have to reach beyond the time
*25:30.220- 25:31.220* :  when they had dementia.
*25:31.740- 25:32.900* :  And you have to look at all photographs
*25:32.900- 25:34.520* :  and remember old stories.
*25:34.720- 25:38.120* :  And then somehow they're conjured to the forefront of your mind again
*25:38.120- 25:40.860* :  because there was nothing to remember.
*25:41.300- 25:43.560* :  It's a very slow, long, painful process
*25:43.600- 25:45.300* :  and you lose a bit of them every day.
*25:46.080- 25:47.600* :  Journalist, Anthea Rowan.
*25:48.400- 25:49.920* :  Let's return to our main story now,
*25:49.920- 25:51.580* :  the devastating attacks in Lebanon.
*25:51.580- 25:55.180* :  It's almost exactly a year since the 7th of October massacre
*25:55.180- 25:55.980* :  in Israel.
*25:56.640- 25:59.400* :  So how dangerous a moment is this for the region?
*25:59.400- 26:02.400* :  A question for our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
*26:03.160- 26:06.720* :  That's a really dangerous, as dangerous as any in the last
*26:06.720- 26:09.880* :  almost 12 months, since those are mass attacks,
*26:09.880- 26:13.100* :  which by the way, this last year has been the most dangerous year
*26:13.660- 26:17.360* :  since 1948 when Israel fought and won for its independence.
*26:19.280- 26:20.740* :  Why is it so dangerous right now?
*26:20.740- 26:23.280* :  Well, that's because at the moment there seems to be
*26:23.900- 26:27.180* :  no possibility of diplomacy getting through
*26:27.760- 26:29.500* :  and de-escalating the situation.
*26:29.980- 26:32.580* :  That's because it depends on a cease-fire in Gaza
*26:33.440- 26:34.840* :  and that isn't happening either.
*26:35.600- 26:38.980* :  Now, while Israel has scored a really significant tactical
*26:39.060- 26:42.500* :  victory here, there is a potential longer term
*26:42.500- 26:46.300* :  serious strategic downside because Israel has humiliated
*26:46.560- 26:47.360* :  its enemy in Lebanon.
*26:47.360- 26:49.160* :  There's no question about that.
*26:49.160- 26:52.240* :  But it doesn't get Israel closer to its strategic aims,
*26:52.240- 26:53.420* :  the things it wants to do.
*26:53.960- 26:56.920* :  That is to stop the rocket fire over the border into Israel.
*26:57.460- 27:00.960* :  60,000 plus people have been evacuated for almost a year
*27:00.960- 27:02.420* :  from their homes as a result of that.
*27:02.420- 27:04.380* :  They want to go home and they want to push
*27:04.380- 27:07.260* :  as well as well back away from the border.
*27:08.040- 27:12.460* :  I do not see how these attacks get Israel closer to that.
*27:12.680- 27:15.020* :  Now, Israel, of course, defends itself, self-defense
*27:15.020- 27:18.320* :  against a terrorist organization is what it would say.
*27:19.000- 27:21.800* :  But there are plenty of people criticizing Israel as well
*27:21.800- 27:24.900* :  for using force somewhat indiscriminately
*27:25.640- 27:27.460* :  as well as hitting military targets,
*27:27.460- 27:28.580* :  those who are fighters,
*27:29.140- 27:30.460* :  also hitting members of their family,
*27:30.460- 27:33.440* :  killing children, killing bystanders in markets.
*27:34.160- 27:36.120* :  So Israel under pressure with that
*27:36.120- 27:37.320* :  and one more thing as well.
*27:37.820- 27:41.480* :  The UN General Assembly is sitting at the moment in New York
*27:41.480- 27:46.080* :  and by a vote of 123 to 14 with 43 abstentions.
*27:46.540- 27:49.400* :  The General Assembly supported a Palestinian resolution
*27:49.400- 27:52.840* :  saying that Israel must end its unlawful presence
*27:52.920- 27:55.220* :  in the occupied territories within a year.
*27:55.220- 28:00.700* :  It's non-binding, but it shows just how isolated the Israelis are.
*28:01.520- 28:03.320* :  Our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
*28:04.020- 28:05.940* :  Now, there are many things that distinguish humans
*28:05.940- 28:07.660* :  from our ancestors, the apes,
*28:07.660- 28:11.140* :  from the ability to create fire to our technological skills.
*28:11.620- 28:12.860* :  Did you know that until now,
*28:12.860- 28:15.940* :  humans were thought to be the only primate that could dance?
*28:16.680- 28:18.180* :  Not anymore, it seems.
*28:18.180- 28:21.840* :  After scientists found that Gibbons also enjoy a jig.
*28:22.280- 28:23.500* :  More from Isabella Jewel.
*28:24.100- 28:25.940* :  They shake very vigorously
*28:26.380- 28:29.460* :  and it's a cross between a robot dance and vogueing.
*28:29.760- 28:32.740* :  This might sound like a standard night out on the town,
*28:33.380- 28:35.380* :  but instead of a sweaty night club,
*28:35.740- 28:39.200* :  the backdrop to this dance is a little more tropical.
*28:40.940- 28:44.920* :  Scientists studying Gibbons a type of ape native to parts of Asia
*28:45.300- 28:47.580* :  say they've discovered that they like to dance.
*28:48.460- 28:50.720* :  And unusually for the animal kingdom,
*28:50.720- 28:54.440* :  where several non-apes species perform a sort of mating dance,
*28:54.480- 28:58.380* :  in this case, it's the female Gibbons who are the most into it.
*28:58.780- 29:02.180* :  Professor Priti Patel-Groes of the University of Oslo
*29:02.500- 29:04.200* :  is co-author of the paper.
*29:04.460- 29:06.160* :  The Gibbons dances our rhythmic
*29:06.160- 29:09.260* :  in that the length of time between individual movements
*29:09.260- 29:11.580* :  and a dance sequence are relatively uniform.
*29:12.180- 29:13.800* :  It's as though they're following a beat.
*29:14.020- 29:17.460* :  The other thing we found is that the dance behavior is intentional,
*29:18.160- 29:20.960* :  so the Gibbons will check to see if there's an audience
*29:20.960- 29:22.120* :  before they dance.
*29:22.440- 29:25.320* :  The Gibbons will dance standing up on their back,
*29:25.360- 29:27.800* :  lying down in different positions.
*29:27.880- 29:30.760* :  So there's not one way in terms of body posture
*29:30.760- 29:32.780* :  that they will perform these dance displays.
*29:33.140- 29:34.420* :  But why do they do it?
*29:34.720- 29:38.080* :  And the wild Gibbon dances have been claimed to be a mating ritual
*29:38.820- 29:41.340* :  in the rescue shelters in Zoos,
*29:41.640- 29:43.220* :  which is where our data came from.
*29:43.840- 29:46.320* :  We find a much broader range of uses.
*29:46.320- 29:49.820* :  They dance to solicit socialization or grooming,
*29:50.560- 29:52.920* :  and they don't just dance to each other,
*29:53.040- 29:56.140* :  but they also direct these dances at humans as well.
*29:56.560- 29:59.760* :  And we think that when they're directed at humans,
*29:59.760- 30:04.020* :  it's in anticipation of feeding social interaction,
*30:05.060- 30:06.420* :  sometimes excitement as well.
*30:06.740- 30:09.720* :  There are 26 different types of ape across the world.
*30:10.300- 30:12.440* :  Is it really just the Gibbons who dance?
*30:13.080- 30:15.240* :  Here's a case where we have a primate.
*30:15.280- 30:18.240* :  It's a small ape that displays rhythmic,
*30:18.240- 30:20.600* :  intentional, structured dancing.
*30:21.320- 30:23.260* :  We can take this methodology in tools
*30:23.680- 30:25.840* :  and try to look for this in the great apes.
*30:26.100- 30:27.780* :  So according to this new research,
*30:27.780- 30:31.680* :  it's not just humans who go bananas for a dance.
*30:32.240- 30:33.500* :  It's about a dual reporting.
*30:36.080- 30:37.160* :  And that's all from us for now.
*30:37.160- 30:39.620* :  There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.

*31:48.260- 31:50.700* :  this is Series 2 of the coming storm.
*31:52.660- 31:54.180* :  There's a divide in American politics.
*31:54.180- 31:56.800* :  Between those who think democracy is in peril
*31:56.800- 31:59.560* :  and those who think it's already been subverted,
*31:59.900- 32:01.400* :  hollowed out from the inside.
*32:01.400- 32:04.660* :  As America prepares to elect its next president,
*32:04.660- 32:07.160* :  we go through the looking glass into a world
*32:07.500- 32:08.900* :  where nothing is as it seems.
*32:09.340- 32:12.100* :  And the institutions of the state are a facade.
