*01:27.880- 01:30.920* :  the 12th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:31.640- 01:36.300* :  Donald Trump and Kamala Harris meet again after both claim victory in yesterday's
*01:36.820- 01:37.380* :  presidential debate.
*01:38.160- 01:41.180* :  Ukraine's president Zelensky calls for big decisions
*01:41.180- 01:46.000* :  as the US and UK ponder permission to use their long-range missiles.
*01:46.880- 01:49.020* :  Protesters take to the streets in Mexico
*01:49.640- 01:52.460* :  after Congress approves the election of all judges.
*01:55.240- 01:56.200* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:56.860- 01:59.580* :  I'm allowed to, but my boyfriend isn't.
*01:59.760- 02:01.640* :  When I do it, it's charming when he does it.
*02:01.640- 02:03.420* :  It's absolutely fairer.
*02:03.880- 02:05.860* :  Should you be allowed to eat in bed?
*02:06.380- 02:08.120* :  We dish up a range of opinions.
*02:10.840- 02:14.960* :  Vice-president Kamala Harris and Donald Trump shook hands again on Wednesday,
*02:14.960- 02:18.720* :  following their competitive televised debate the night before.
*02:19.400- 02:21.600* :  But this doesn't mean the entity is going away.
*02:21.600- 02:25.020* :  They met again at one of America's most solemn occasions.
*02:25.820- 02:27.900* :  In New York, at the ground zero site,
*02:28.380- 02:30.480* :  where the people killed on September 11,
*02:30.480- 02:33.020* :  23 years ago were remembered.
*02:33.680- 02:36.380* :  For millions of Americans, there has been good news today.
*02:37.000- 02:38.540* :  Another drop in core inflation,
*02:38.540- 02:41.480* :  which is hoped will encourage a cut in interest rates.
*02:42.180- 02:44.120* :  The economy was a big issue in the debate,
*02:44.120- 02:48.260* :  and will be all the way up to polling day on November 5th.
*02:48.620- 02:52.760* :  But initial polls suggest Ms. Harris did better than Mr. Trump.
*02:52.760- 02:56.960* :  Our Washington correspondent Ioni Wells gave me her assessment.
*02:57.620- 03:00.140* :  Well, I think any debate like this is of course important.
*03:00.140- 03:02.940* :  It's a chance for the candidates to really land
*03:02.940- 03:05.320* :  some of their core messages with voters.
*03:05.860- 03:08.880* :  Now, we still need to wait a couple of days really until we get
*03:09.380- 03:11.280* :  further updates on the national picture,
*03:11.280- 03:13.160* :  the state sort of picture of polls
*03:13.300- 03:15.040* :  and how they've shifted over the last couple of days.
*03:15.140- 03:17.700* :  But there were some snap polls that took place
*03:17.700- 03:19.760* :  just after the debate itself.
*03:19.760- 03:22.460* :  There was a UGov survey of more than 2000 voters,
*03:23.020- 03:26.620* :  which suggested that 54% thought that Kamala Harris,
*03:26.900- 03:30.400* :  one only 31% thought Trump did in a CNN one.
*03:30.460- 03:32.500* :  Similarly, that suggested that the voters
*03:32.500- 03:35.960* :  hold thought that Harris was the better performer in the debate.
*03:35.960- 03:38.360* :  But of course, these are only kind of snapshots really
*03:38.400- 03:40.260* :  of that immediate reaction after the debate.
*03:40.260- 03:42.700* :  And of course, that should be coupled with the context
*03:42.700- 03:45.120* :  that only sort of 4% suggested that the debate
*03:45.120- 03:46.460* :  actually change their minds.
*03:46.960- 03:49.180* :  And one thing we know is that the core group
*03:49.180- 03:51.560* :  that both candidates really need to appeal to at the moment
*03:51.560- 03:53.800* :  is undecided voters, those who aren't
*03:53.800- 03:57.060* :  sort of passionately supporters of one party or the other.
*03:57.220- 03:58.920* :  So I think there is still quite a long way
*03:58.920- 04:01.280* :  to go for both candidates to really sort of convince
*04:01.280- 04:04.060* :  some of those undecided voters why they should vote for them.
*04:04.460- 04:06.520* :  But I think one thing that will certainly
*04:06.520- 04:08.040* :  have sort of shifted the dial about this debate
*04:08.040- 04:10.440* :  is some of the key soundwights that came out of it,
*04:10.440- 04:13.320* :  whether it was Kamala Harris' message on abortion,
*04:13.520- 04:15.180* :  and then they need to protect reproductive rights,
*04:15.180- 04:18.240* :  or whether it was Donald Trump repeating a debunked claim
*04:18.240- 04:21.220* :  that heightened migrants, eating people's pets in Ohio,
*04:21.820- 04:24.080* :  these kind of sound bites that came across in the debate.
*04:24.140- 04:26.180* :  I think that it already being massively shared
*04:26.180- 04:28.200* :  on social media, and I think will certainly
*04:28.200- 04:31.280* :  be things that voters around the US see in the coming days.
*04:31.660- 04:33.220* :  Undondled Trump at times did appear
*04:33.220- 04:35.500* :  to be on the back foot during the debate last night.
*04:35.500- 04:38.140* :  Is there any sign from his team what they'll be doing next?
*04:38.380- 04:39.980* :  Well, Kamala Harris has certainly said
*04:39.980- 04:42.320* :  that she's up for round two for a second debate.
*04:42.320- 04:44.300* :  That's something his team haven't committed to.
*04:44.700- 04:46.040* :  Some have read that as a suggestion
*04:46.040- 04:48.160* :  that perhaps he didn't feel it went as well
*04:48.160- 04:49.400* :  as it could have done for him.
*04:49.680- 04:52.280* :  I think certainly in terms of his sort of campaign plans,
*04:52.500- 04:54.540* :  as I mentioned there, I think he's going to be planning
*04:54.540- 04:56.420* :  to really kind of double down on some of the key messages
*04:56.420- 04:57.860* :  he tried to land in that debate,
*04:57.860- 05:00.600* :  whether it's things like the economy or immigration.
*05:00.600- 05:02.680* :  I think he sees those as some of his strengths
*05:02.680- 05:04.560* :  when it comes to sort of key talking points,
*05:04.920- 05:06.680* :  but also continuing to campaign
*05:06.680- 05:08.480* :  in some of those key battleground states,
*05:08.480- 05:11.340* :  which are going to be really where this election is won or lost.
*05:11.600- 05:13.440* :  And one of the key battleground states
*05:13.440- 05:16.280* :  are only worlds was talking about is Michigan.
*05:16.380- 05:19.500* :  Our correspondent John Sudworth has been finding out
*05:19.500- 05:21.520* :  how voters there viewed the debate.
*05:25.160- 05:27.140* :  On the streets of Saginaw County,
*05:27.760- 05:30.140* :  the canvases are battling for every vote,
*05:30.800- 05:32.020* :  sometimes quite literally.
*05:32.880- 05:33.420* :  At the joke.
*05:34.380- 05:36.720* :  OK, well, so this is a guy that, you know,
*05:36.720- 05:38.660* :  I ran into earlier, so.
*05:38.660- 05:39.720* :  Vote for Trump.
*05:40.260- 05:41.220* :  Here's the joke.
*05:41.940- 05:42.560* :  He's a clown.
*05:44.800- 05:46.020* :  Underneath the new paint,
*05:46.020- 05:48.260* :  this is still Rust Belt country.
*05:48.840- 05:50.800* :  Once solid Democrat Donald Trump
*05:50.800- 05:53.400* :  snatched an arrow victory here in 2016
*05:53.460- 05:56.160* :  with Michigan's closed down car plants
*05:56.160- 05:59.100* :  that backdroped to his message of American decline.
*05:59.100- 06:01.920* :  There are, I don't say her, because she has no policy.
*06:02.760- 06:04.580* :  There are still car workers here.
*06:05.280- 06:07.060* :  And at this union organized event,
*06:09.620- 06:11.940* :  there was no doubting the allegiance,
*06:16.240- 06:17.940* :  as they rooted for Kamala Harris,
*06:20.620- 06:22.340* :  but in these uncertain times,
*06:23.100- 06:26.680* :  dig a bit deeper and the political tensions are easy to find.
*06:27.860- 06:31.040* :  There's a lot less people here than they were expected.
*06:31.080- 06:34.520* :  One of the organizers has told me that his father
*06:35.480- 06:36.800* :  and his uncles, all of them,
*06:36.800- 06:40.040* :  lifelong union men have all gone over to Trump.
*06:40.460- 06:41.940* :  And he's not sure about his sons.
*06:43.540- 06:45.160* :  In a deeply divided state,
*06:45.160- 06:47.180* :  it's the undecided voters
*06:47.420- 06:49.280* :  who'll call the outcome of this election.
*06:50.160- 06:51.580* :  So what did they make of the debate?
*06:52.360- 06:54.520* :  I do like what she's talking about,
*06:54.520- 06:57.040* :  in particular, about women's rights.
*06:57.360- 06:58.640* :  I'm real big on that.
*06:59.000- 07:01.340* :  And also, most of all, the economy.
*07:01.960- 07:02.820* :  Enough to vote for her?
*07:04.500- 07:05.120* :  Probably.
*07:06.200- 07:08.620* :  I grew up here, my whole life.
*07:08.920- 07:10.640* :  I've been here when we had factory plants
*07:10.640- 07:13.120* :  in every corner of our major roads.
*07:13.640- 07:14.240* :  That's all gone.
*07:14.960- 07:15.780* :  I'm going to vote for Trump.
*07:18.800- 07:20.180* :  Debates are fleeting.
*07:20.180- 07:23.540* :  It is economic sentiments that sway voters.
*07:24.440- 07:26.480* :  This company polishes giant trucks,
*07:26.480- 07:28.480* :  the lifeblood of America's economy.
*07:29.500- 07:31.840* :  Trump has this message of a broken America.
*07:32.760- 07:33.780* :  Does that resonate with you?
*07:34.360- 07:36.680* :  Yeah, I think America is kind of broken right now.
*07:36.680- 07:38.440* :  I think everyone's just fighting
*07:38.440- 07:39.900* :  just to keep their head above the water.
*07:42.460- 07:45.020* :  It's here in the hard grimy work
*07:45.020- 07:46.800* :  that Democrats used to count on.
*07:47.380- 07:48.880* :  You get a sense of the changes
*07:48.880- 07:50.800* :  that make this election so close.
*07:51.720- 07:54.880* :  John Sudworth, with the presidential debate over
*07:55.320- 07:57.580* :  and a vice presidential debate still to come,
*07:58.100- 07:59.640* :  work elaborating with our colleagues
*07:59.640- 08:02.180* :  at BBC America's to bring you
*08:02.180- 08:04.100* :  a special edition ahead of the poll.
*08:04.660- 08:06.340* :  If you have any questions you want answered
*08:06.340- 08:09.200* :  by our team in the US, then please send them in.
*08:09.640- 08:12.700* :  You can email or send a voice note to global podcast
*08:12.740- 08:18.720* :  at bbc.co.uk or tweet us at Global NewsPod to Ukraine.
*08:24.800- 08:27.060* :  There was a reminder in Kiev on Wednesday
*08:27.060- 08:29.040* :  that diplomacy in the midst of a war
*08:29.440- 08:30.340* :  can be interrupted.
*08:31.020- 08:33.680* :  That siren sounded as the US Secretary of State
*08:33.680- 08:37.080* :  Anthony Blinken, his UK counterpart David Lamy
*08:37.480- 08:39.660* :  and President Vladimir Zelensky were meeting
*08:39.660- 08:42.460* :  to discuss further Western support for Ukraine.
*08:43.320- 08:44.760* :  Ukraine's new foreign minister,
*08:44.760- 08:47.740* :  Andrii Sibahai, outlined what was said.
*08:48.460- 08:52.920* :  The main topic of our discussion was the strengthening
*08:52.920- 08:56.300* :  of the defense capabilities of our countries.
*08:56.820- 09:00.240* :  After 16 fighter planes, artillery shells,
*09:00.240- 09:02.660* :  everything that works for our victory.
*09:03.180- 09:06.660* :  Mr. Blinken announced $700 million in new funding
*09:07.160- 09:09.680* :  and he also said the message to Moscow was clear.
*09:10.140- 09:13.500* :  The bottom line is this, we want Ukraine to win
*09:14.120- 09:15.960* :  and we're fully committed to keep marshalling the support
*09:16.580- 09:18.500* :  that it needs for its brave defenders and citizens
*09:19.440- 09:20.220* :  to do just that.
*09:21.460- 09:23.600* :  Now, support for Ukraine will endure
*09:24.560- 09:26.360* :  because it doesn't depend on any one country,
*09:27.400- 09:29.380* :  any one party, any one election.
*09:30.180- 09:33.880* :  Here today, the United States, the United Kingdom,
*09:34.760- 09:37.400* :  are united in support of Ukraine and its success.
*09:38.360- 09:41.360* :  Also at the news conference was our diplomatic correspondent,
*09:41.360- 09:42.500* :  James Landel.
*09:42.960- 09:45.240* :  What's fascinating is you have to read between the lines.
*09:45.700- 09:48.780* :  When you ask Mr. Lamy about these long-range missiles
*09:48.980- 09:52.080* :  and whether or not the UK and the US are going to give permission
*09:52.080- 09:55.300* :  for Ukraine to use these missiles to strike deeper
*09:55.760- 09:58.840* :  into Russian territory, Mr. Lamy tends
*09:58.840- 10:00.880* :  to sort of try and brush the question away by saying
*10:00.880- 10:03.180* :  he's not going to help Mr. Putin by talking
*10:03.180- 10:06.700* :  about tactical operational decisions in public.
*10:07.460- 10:09.500* :  But then he makes an argument for change.
*10:09.620- 10:13.240* :  He makes the argument that now that it is proven
*10:13.240- 10:17.300* :  that Russia is getting access to Iranian missiles,
*10:18.200- 10:19.780* :  he says that's changed the debate.
*10:19.780- 10:23.280* :  That means that Ukraine has to think about
*10:23.300- 10:24.500* :  how it's going to defend itself
*10:25.520- 10:26.980* :  and that gets you into a different space
*10:26.980- 10:29.080* :  to say, well, maybe Ukraine doesn't need greater capability.
*10:29.960- 10:32.820* :  When you listen carefully to Mr. Blinken,
*10:32.820- 10:34.840* :  he says, look, you know, we're thinking about these things.
*10:35.460- 10:37.520* :  He's going to give advice to the President.
*10:37.520- 10:39.580* :  Mr. Lamy will give advice to the Prime Minister.
*10:39.580- 10:40.740* :  They're meeting on Friday.
*10:41.620- 10:42.980* :  This is going to be discussed further.
*10:42.980- 10:44.580* :  We think at the UN General Assembly,
*10:44.580- 10:47.440* :  when Mr. Zelensky will meet Mr. Biden face to face.
*10:47.780- 10:49.920* :  So I don't think any decision is imminent on this.
*10:50.380- 10:53.620* :  But clearly, they think that it's moving in a direction.
*10:53.660- 10:55.300* :  Mr. Blinken, for example, you know,
*10:55.300- 10:58.400* :  it was quite dismissive of the argument that critics make,
*10:58.400- 11:00.480* :  which, you know, particularly within the US system,
*11:00.800- 11:03.640* :  who say you can't authorize these kind of a lot
*11:03.640- 11:06.020* :  deep, long-range fires as they're known,
*11:06.480- 11:08.560* :  because there's a real risk of escalation.
*11:08.900- 11:10.840* :  Well, Mr. Blinken said, well, yeah, you know,
*11:11.420- 11:12.840* :  escalation is the fact that we have to consider,
*11:13.220- 11:15.280* :  but it's certainly not the only factor.
*11:15.620- 11:17.020* :  So at the moment, what we're seeing
*11:17.020- 11:19.140* :  is an evolving discussion and argument,
*11:19.140- 11:20.400* :  not a final decision.
*11:20.660- 11:22.400* :  And how crucial are the talks coming up
*11:22.400- 11:24.980* :  between President Biden and President Zelensky?
*11:25.140- 11:26.180* :  Oh, I think they're absolutely crucial,
*11:26.180- 11:28.680* :  because that, I think, is where ultimately
*11:28.680- 11:29.880* :  this decision is going to be made.
*11:30.180- 11:32.960* :  Mr. Biden so far, President Biden has been reluctant
*11:32.960- 11:33.820* :  to go down this line.
*11:33.880- 11:35.080* :  He's listened to one of his advisors,
*11:35.080- 11:36.940* :  Michael Jake Sullivan, National Security Advisor,
*11:37.400- 11:39.420* :  who've been very cautious about,
*11:39.420- 11:44.120* :  throughout this whole war, about going hard on new weapons
*11:44.120- 11:47.900* :  and risking further escalatory attack from the Russians.
*11:48.240- 11:50.640* :  But actually, what's happening now is that Mr. Blinken,
*11:50.640- 11:51.960* :  Mr. Lamy and others say, well, actually,
*11:51.960- 11:53.600* :  that escalation is happening anyway.
*11:54.140- 11:56.780* :  It is the Russians that are suddenly going to start,
*11:56.860- 11:58.380* :  he's starting to use Iranian missiles.
*11:58.480- 12:01.760* :  It is the Russians who are stepping up their tax
*12:02.180- 12:03.360* :  in the east of Ukraine.
*12:03.360- 12:05.220* :  It is the Russians who are sending
*12:05.220- 12:08.460* :  these incredibly powerful, dangerous glide bombs.
*12:08.800- 12:10.560* :  So that's the argument they're making,
*12:10.560- 12:12.460* :  and it's an evolving argument.
*12:13.000- 12:13.800* :  James Landel.
*12:14.460- 12:16.820* :  Next day, disturbing story in Malaysia,
*12:17.380- 12:19.920* :  where police say they've rescued hundreds of children
*12:19.920- 12:22.960* :  from care homes run by an Islamic charity.
*12:23.600- 12:25.440* :  It's claimed that youngsters were subjected
*12:25.440- 12:29.200* :  to physical and sexual abuse, religious teachers
*12:29.200- 12:30.780* :  and carers have been arrested.
*12:31.460- 12:34.580* :  I heard more from our Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Hatton.
*12:35.160- 12:37.080* :  The authorities say that they'd actually
*12:37.080- 12:41.860* :  been receiving reports and complaints about these homes,
*12:41.860- 12:44.560* :  the charity that oversees these homes,
*12:44.560- 12:47.620* :  which are located in two Malaysian provinces,
*12:48.080- 12:50.240* :  dating back to 2011.
*12:51.200- 12:54.200* :  But police say that many of the complaints were withdrawn
*12:54.200- 12:56.400* :  after those who had involved,
*12:56.400- 12:59.340* :  who'd actually filed the complaints, received threats.
*12:59.960- 13:02.340* :  And so it wasn't until earlier this month,
*13:02.820- 13:04.780* :  when new reports were filed against
*13:04.780- 13:06.960* :  what was taking place inside these homes,
*13:07.380- 13:10.960* :  that police carried out six earlier arrests very quietly,
*13:11.500- 13:14.560* :  and then started to plan the big early morning raid
*13:14.560- 13:15.820* :  that we saw today.
*13:15.920- 13:17.220* :  So what happened on this raid?
*13:17.220- 13:19.640* :  And those arrested, what have they been accused of?
*13:19.680- 13:23.220* :  Well, around 1,000 police, social workers
*13:23.220- 13:26.480* :  and health workers were involved in the raids today
*13:26.480- 13:28.980* :  on these 20 charity homes.
*13:28.980- 13:31.840* :  They rescued more than 400 children.
*13:31.840- 13:36.760* :  They then went on to arrest 66 men and 105 women.
*13:36.780- 13:39.980* :  Those people arrested, they say, were carers
*13:40.400- 13:42.080* :  and religious teachers.
*13:42.700- 13:46.780* :  They've been accused of physical and sexual abuse,
*13:47.100- 13:50.560* :  on the children, but also inciting the children
*13:50.560- 13:51.940* :  to abuse one another.
*13:52.520- 13:55.280* :  They say that sometimes some of the children were found
*13:55.300- 13:58.400* :  with burns from hot spoons on their body.
*13:58.400- 14:01.260* :  They say that many of the children were in ill health.
*14:01.300- 14:03.920* :  They weren't allowed to seek medical treatment
*14:03.920- 14:06.480* :  until they were in critical condition.
*14:07.120- 14:08.760* :  And alarmingly, the authorities say
*14:08.760- 14:10.660* :  that they can't rule out the possibility
*14:11.200- 14:13.540* :  that there were some deaths under the watch
*14:13.540- 14:15.420* :  of this charity syndicate.
*14:15.620- 14:17.840* :  Well, the conditions for the children sound horrific.
*14:17.840- 14:19.460* :  Do we know anything more about them?
*14:19.540- 14:21.140* :  Well, we know that there were equal numbers
*14:21.140- 14:25.480* :  of girls and boys rescued from these homes,
*14:25.480- 14:29.380* :  ranging in age from one to 17.
*14:29.380- 14:33.660* :  Now, remarkably, many of these children are not orphaned.
*14:33.660- 14:35.040* :  So these were not orphanages.
*14:35.760- 14:37.880* :  Instead, many of these children were sent
*14:37.880- 14:40.200* :  to live in these homes by their parents
*14:40.700- 14:42.340* :  who believe that they were going to be receiving
*14:42.340- 14:43.700* :  religious education.
*14:43.840- 14:46.500* :  It's also said that many of the children came
*14:46.500- 14:47.800* :  from poor backgrounds.
*14:48.400- 14:51.140* :  So I think that these families believe
*14:51.140- 14:52.620* :  that they didn't have much of a choice
*14:52.640- 14:54.240* :  that was probably the best place
*14:54.700- 14:56.700* :  for their children to grow up.
*14:57.000- 14:59.180* :  The authorities say there's simply so many children
*14:59.220- 15:00.840* :  that it's going to take them two weeks.
*15:00.840- 15:02.120* :  They've been sent to go and live
*15:02.120- 15:03.560* :  in a police training center.
*15:03.860- 15:05.260* :  It's going to take around two weeks
*15:05.260- 15:08.120* :  for the authorities to process all the children
*15:08.480- 15:10.760* :  and to assess their current state of health
*15:10.760- 15:12.020* :  and their current mental health.
*15:12.620- 15:15.520* :  Celia Hatton, one of the most high-profile murders
*15:15.520- 15:17.360* :  during the conflict in Northern Ireland
*15:17.360- 15:19.760* :  is to be the subject of a public inquiry
*15:20.260- 15:21.760* :  ordered by the UK government.
*15:22.360- 15:24.340* :  Pat Phanookan, a human rights lawyer,
*15:24.340- 15:27.260* :  was killed by pro-British loyalist paramilitaries
*15:27.660- 15:30.400* :  at his home in Belfast in 1989.
*15:31.260- 15:33.520* :  Mr. Phanookan's family welcomed the announcement,
*15:33.580- 15:36.760* :  saying that after 35 years of cover-ups,
*15:37.100- 15:38.540* :  it was now time for the truth.
*15:39.160- 15:41.200* :  Here's our island correspondent, Chris Page.
*15:42.000- 15:44.720* :  Previous investigations have already find evidence
*15:44.800- 15:47.300* :  that members of the security forces colluded
*15:47.600- 15:49.100* :  in the murder of Pat Phanookan.
*15:49.540- 15:51.620* :  Naya Public and Quarry is set to examine
*15:51.620- 15:53.100* :  the extent of their involvement.
*15:53.580- 15:55.280* :  The Northern Ireland Secretary Hillary Ben
*15:55.280- 15:57.860* :  told Parliament that the decision would follow through
*15:57.860- 16:00.980* :  on guarantees from the past, which ministers gave,
*16:01.460- 16:02.360* :  but didn't act on.
*16:02.360- 16:06.840* :  Plain fact is that two decades on,
*16:07.360- 16:09.760* :  the commitment made by the government,
*16:10.380- 16:12.720* :  first in the agreement with the Irish government
*16:12.720- 16:16.280* :  and then to this house to establish an inquiry
*16:16.280- 16:20.600* :  into the death of Mr. Phanookan remains unfulfilled.
*16:21.700- 16:24.200* :  It is for this exceptional reason
*16:24.860- 16:28.480* :  that I have decided to establish an independent inquiry.
*16:29.140- 16:31.480* :  Mr. Phanookan was a high-profile defense lawyer
*16:31.480- 16:33.560* :  during the conflict known as the Troubles.
*16:33.580- 16:37.660* :  He was shot 14 times in front of his family at his home.
*16:38.140- 16:39.940* :  The gone men were from the loyalist group,
*16:39.940- 16:41.600* :  the Ulster Defense Association.
*16:42.220- 16:44.260* :  Two paramilitaries involved in the murder
*16:44.260- 16:47.320* :  were working as informers for the police and the army.
*16:47.980- 16:51.200* :  Mr. Phanookan's son, John, is an MP for Sinn Fein.
*16:51.660- 16:53.780* :  He rejected claims by some unionists
*16:53.780- 16:56.960* :  that his father's case was being given preferential treatments.
*16:57.680- 16:58.940* :  First of all, the state targeted,
*16:59.760- 17:00.520* :  unsat in place,
*17:02.200- 17:05.500* :  certain motion events that my father was murdered
*17:05.500- 17:07.160* :  in front of all of us as we had our dinner.
*17:08.500- 17:10.700* :  The term collusion was dismissed
*17:11.440- 17:14.880* :  and we've had to fade tooth and nail every step of the way.
*17:15.400- 17:17.680* :  Phanookan's family have taken legal proceedings
*17:17.680- 17:19.040* :  over a number of years
*17:19.360- 17:22.000* :  to try to get the government to call a public inquiry.
*17:22.100- 17:25.240* :  He was one of more than three and a half thousand people
*17:25.240- 17:26.780* :  he were killed in Northern Ireland
*17:26.780- 17:30.320* :  from the late 1960s until the late 1990s.
*17:30.720- 17:33.200* :  The question of how the deaths should be investigated
*17:33.600- 17:36.400* :  remains one of the most complex and contentious issues
*17:36.840- 17:37.940* :  in this part of the UK.
*17:38.800- 17:41.220* :  The Irish Prime Minister, the Teeshak Simon Harris,
*17:41.220- 17:43.640* :  welcomed the announcement of the inquiry
*17:44.200- 17:46.900* :  saying it was a vindication of a long campaign.
*17:47.600- 17:48.240* :  Chris Page.
*17:51.080- 17:51.720* :  Still to come.
*17:52.360- 17:54.120* :  I was not a tailor with Phan.
*17:54.120- 17:55.480* :  It was just a question of time
*17:55.880- 17:57.620* :  and you'll probably pay a price for it
*17:57.620- 17:59.000* :  at the in the marketplace.
*17:59.500- 18:02.460* :  After Taylor Swift publicly backed Kamala Harris,
*18:03.100- 18:05.500* :  we ask what roles celebrity endorsements have
*18:05.500- 18:06.660* :  in U.S. Elections?

*19:52.500- 19:54.900* :  Israel's latest attack on a UN school in Gaza
*19:54.900- 19:56.940* :  came in broad daylight, throwing panic

*20:00.120- 20:02.680* :  Videos in the aftermath show are now depressingly familiar
*20:02.680- 20:04.880* :  scene, rescuers searching through the rubble,

*20:30.040- 20:31.900* :  to elect judges at all levels.
*20:32.660- 20:34.720* :  The reforms have sparked mass protest
*20:34.720- 20:38.740* :  including in Mexico City, where protesters stormed Congress,
*20:38.740- 20:41.480* :  forcing politicians to move into another building.
*20:42.160- 20:45.400* :  The outgoing president, Andreas Manuel Lopez-Obrador,

*20:55.800- 20:59.720* :  I think that we will move forward in Mexico
*21:00.140- 21:01.540* :  and set an example for the world,
*21:02.000- 21:04.580* :  because the judiciary, as has been more than demonstrated,
*21:04.580- 21:06.300* :  does not administer justice.
*21:06.780- 21:09.320* :  But critics like these demonstrators in the capital
*21:09.340- 21:12.520* :  say the measures will threaten judicial independence
*21:13.120- 21:15.320* :  and undermine the system of checks and balances.
*21:16.020- 21:20.820* :  Because it goes against the counterweight
*21:20.820- 21:22.460* :  and the impartiality of the judge,
*21:23.040- 21:25.140* :  the judge has no democratic role at all.
*21:25.640- 21:27.240* :  And that is what the legislator's are for.
*21:27.740- 21:29.300* :  They are supposed to be our representatives.
*21:29.460- 21:31.660* :  They have turned a deaf ear to our requests.
*21:31.720- 21:33.300* :  The judge must be impartial
*21:33.400- 21:35.380* :  and his loyalty must be to the Constitution.
*21:35.420- 21:41.400* :  The election does not guarantee that there will be no corruption.
*21:42.000- 21:44.300* :  And it does guarantee that they will not have
*21:44.340- 21:45.500* :  well-prepared judges.
*21:45.920- 21:48.260* :  Right now, there are judges who are well-prepared
*21:48.640- 21:50.660* :  and preparation makes you more committed
*21:50.660- 21:52.120* :  to the people than election.
*21:52.880- 21:54.660* :  The plan means thousands of states
*21:54.660- 21:56.700* :  and federal judges will be fired,
*21:57.260- 21:59.320* :  including the entire Supreme Court
*21:59.840- 22:01.340* :  and replaced into elections.
*22:02.260- 22:04.000* :  Why are these measures so controversial?
*22:04.580- 22:06.560* :  That's a question I pose to our correspondent
*22:06.560- 22:08.720* :  in Mexico City, Will Grant.
*22:09.360- 22:12.180* :  All 7,000 judges and magistrates in Mexico
*22:12.180- 22:13.460* :  will be directly elected.
*22:14.000- 22:16.700* :  That alone is enough to infuriate
*22:17.000- 22:19.260* :  not just oversee the Supreme Court itself,
*22:19.860- 22:22.920* :  but actually many of the employees
*22:22.920- 22:24.120* :  of the justice system,
*22:24.500- 22:27.120* :  law students, opponents more broadly
*22:27.120- 22:28.760* :  to Andrews Manuel López Obrador,
*22:29.060- 22:32.000* :  people who feel that the whole operation is an effort
*22:32.000- 22:34.860* :  to strengthen power into the hands
*22:34.860- 22:36.760* :  of his governing party Morena,
*22:37.120- 22:40.020* :  a sort of final parting shot from Mr López Obrador
*22:40.420- 22:42.020* :  before he stands down next month.
*22:42.200- 22:44.080* :  In the short term, what impact would this have
*22:44.080- 22:45.860* :  on the judicial system in Mexico?
*22:46.220- 22:48.000* :  I think short term, it's going to make things
*22:48.000- 22:49.980* :  a bit difficult, quite honestly,
*22:49.980- 22:52.840* :  in the sense that many of those who turned out
*22:52.840- 22:55.120* :  and you heard the protest is there,
*22:55.540- 22:58.320* :  will have been made up of striking workers
*22:58.800- 23:00.180* :  from the Supreme Court,
*23:00.180- 23:02.300* :  from the justice system more broadly.
*23:02.760- 23:05.000* :  And if they want to, they can really bring things
*23:05.500- 23:07.680* :  to a halt if they deepen and strengthen
*23:07.680- 23:10.500* :  and widen their strikes as they're threatening to.
*23:10.900- 23:13.240* :  They don't see this as necessarily ending
*23:13.680- 23:15.000* :  with the president's rubber stamp
*23:15.000- 23:16.800* :  once the bill reaches his desk.
*23:17.100- 23:19.140* :  They think this has still got a way to go,
*23:19.140- 23:22.500* :  although they do know that legally, as it were,
*23:22.560- 23:24.600* :  there's not much more they can do at this stage,
*23:24.600- 23:28.080* :  leaving protests pretty much their only tool at this point.
*23:28.440- 23:30.600* :  I'm briefly, Will, does the president consider this
*23:30.600- 23:32.040* :  to be his legacy in many ways?
*23:32.300- 23:34.740* :  I think so, he's talked about how corrupt
*23:34.760- 23:38.140* :  and infiltrated by organized crime, he believes,
*23:38.740- 23:40.120* :  the justice system in Mexico,
*23:40.120- 23:41.940* :  to be he's believed for a long time
*23:41.940- 23:44.480* :  that it's in need of complete root and branch reform.
*23:44.960- 23:47.400* :  He's often said that this is the way that he thinks
*23:47.400- 23:50.080* :  it can be more democratic, not less democratic,
*23:50.080- 23:53.480* :  by actual popular vote choosing all of those judges,
*23:53.860- 23:55.380* :  and he will be extremely pleased
*23:55.380- 23:57.360* :  to have got this through before he leaves office.
*23:58.000- 23:59.720* :  Will Grant in Mexico City.
*24:00.720- 24:02.440* :  Are your efforts to get a good night's sleep
*24:02.440- 24:04.540* :  disrupted by someone else snoring?
*24:05.140- 24:06.280* :  Or are you the culprit?
*24:06.840- 24:08.400* :  Well, help may be at hand.
*24:08.840- 24:11.240* :  A new study suggests that an epilepsy drug,
*24:11.680- 24:13.520* :  Salthiam, could reduce it,
*24:13.840- 24:15.500* :  and also the more serious symptoms
*24:15.500- 24:17.280* :  of obstructive sleep apnea.
*24:17.740- 24:19.260* :  At the moment, CPAP devices
*24:19.260- 24:21.800* :  applying continuous positive airway pressure
*24:22.220- 24:24.780* :  or oral appliances are typically used.
*24:25.400- 24:27.260* :  Lindsey Browning is a sleep expert
*24:27.260- 24:29.480* :  with a doctorate in insomnia.
*24:30.080- 24:32.580* :  The major treatment for snoring sleep apnea
*24:33.000- 24:35.180* :  is like you said, the physical opening
*24:35.180- 24:38.280* :  and continuous airway pressure to help people breathe
*24:38.560- 24:40.360* :  by either keeping the airway open
*24:40.360- 24:43.060* :  by a mandibular device that sort of makes the lower jaw
*24:43.560- 24:45.300* :  go forward so that you keep the airway open
*24:45.300- 24:47.380* :  or with the continuous pressure of air
*24:47.380- 24:49.440* :  throughout the night to keep that airway open.
*24:49.900- 24:52.100* :  And of course, sleep apnea is hugely important
*24:52.100- 24:53.700* :  it has such devastating effects.
*24:54.360- 24:55.440* :  Because if it's untreated,
*24:55.620- 24:57.460* :  then people sleep is fragmented,
*24:57.460- 24:59.560* :  they're continually waking up throughout the night,
*24:59.560- 25:00.860* :  they have daytime fatigue,
*25:01.500- 25:02.620* :  they might fall asleep at the wheel,
*25:02.620- 25:05.160* :  they're so tired as well as the impact it has on their
*25:05.260- 25:07.020* :  greater health, like their risk of heart attacks,
*25:07.020- 25:09.260* :  high blood pressure, weight gain, that kind of thing.
*25:09.500- 25:11.380* :  This trial was on a small group of people
*25:11.380- 25:12.960* :  and it was a very preliminary thing.
*25:12.960- 25:16.260* :  So we can't draw huge plans for a health care from it,
*25:16.300- 25:18.980* :  but it is really exciting that there might be
*25:18.980- 25:22.120* :  a drug treatment available that is going to help with sleep
*25:22.120- 25:24.460* :  apnea because the trouble with CPAP machines
*25:24.460- 25:26.640* :  is that some people really don't get on with them.
*25:27.040- 25:28.440* :  Either they don't fit properly,
*25:28.660- 25:30.000* :  though they come from the middle of the night
*25:30.000- 25:31.820* :  or people just find them so uncomfortable
*25:31.820- 25:33.520* :  that they just don't want to sleep with them.
*25:33.920- 25:36.720* :  So if for those people who can't use CPAP machines,
*25:36.740- 25:38.880* :  there are other alternatives available
*25:38.880- 25:42.180* :  and if this drug, which is already used for epilepsy
*25:42.180- 25:46.640* :  and children, if this drug might be one of several options,
*25:47.200- 25:50.060* :  going forwards more clinical trials to see about the side effects,
*25:50.060- 25:53.240* :  see if it really is as effective as this preliminary study suggests,
*25:53.820- 25:56.400* :  that would be really exciting to help treat more people
*25:56.400- 25:57.100* :  with CPAP near.
*25:57.600- 25:58.440* :  Lindsay Browning.
*25:58.860- 26:01.460* :  Well, if snoring isn't causing arguments in the bedroom,
*26:01.460- 26:04.860* :  how about the age-old debate about whether you can eat in bed?
*26:05.660- 26:07.900* :  The UK food writer, Nigella Lawson,
*26:07.900- 26:10.420* :  author of How to Be a Domestic Goddess,
*26:10.980- 26:12.340* :  revealed to the Times newspaper,
*26:12.940- 26:14.720* :  that's one of the favorite spots for a meal.
*26:15.420- 26:17.300* :  I am very pro eating in bed.
*26:17.300- 26:19.780* :  I will eat absolutely anything in bed,
*26:19.780- 26:21.960* :  except something that needs a knife and fork.
*26:21.960- 26:24.480* :  It has to be either fingers or a spoon.
*26:25.380- 26:28.600* :  Those words were voiced up by producer and not Nigella.
*26:29.020- 26:31.500* :  So are you into eating under the sheets?
*26:32.080- 26:33.280* :  Or does it fill you with horror?
*26:33.640- 26:36.820* :  William Sitwell is a restaurant critic for the Daily Telegraph,
*26:37.280- 26:38.520* :  but first Hannah Betts,
*26:38.800- 26:40.380* :  a feature writer and columnist,
*26:40.560- 26:41.600* :  based here in the UK.
*26:42.420- 26:44.120* :  I'm with the domestic goddess.
*26:44.120- 26:47.120* :  I think people who talk at breakfast are the real animals,
*26:47.120- 26:48.820* :  but breakfast in bed is fine.
*26:49.380- 26:52.760* :  Although there is a caveat, I do have one rule.
*26:53.460- 26:56.160* :  I'm allowed to, but my boyfriend isn't.
*26:56.600- 27:01.020* :  I am a delicate napkin to Julia Flight type creature
*27:01.020- 27:02.800* :  eating off a tray with my newspaper,
*27:03.680- 27:06.500* :  but he is a clumsy heterosexual male
*27:07.020- 27:08.900* :  who leaves a permanent trail of detritus,
*27:08.920- 27:11.260* :  a bit like the pig pen character in Snoopy.
*27:11.260- 27:13.820* :  So when I do it, it's charming when he does it.
*27:13.820- 27:15.380* :  It's absolutely fair.
*27:15.680- 27:16.560* :  It's a beautiful dish.
*27:16.560- 27:19.460* :  It's me sitting up, surrounded by cushions
*27:19.460- 27:21.600* :  and a lapel and negligee and a turban,
*27:21.600- 27:24.620* :  receiving gentleman callers and during my level,
*27:25.460- 27:26.360* :  picture of elegance.
*27:26.740- 27:28.680* :  You know, Hannah talks so beautifully,
*27:28.680- 27:30.920* :  wants to almost convince, but only almost.
*27:31.120- 27:33.560* :  Nigella is a goddess on everything apart from this,
*27:33.560- 27:35.680* :  where she's, I'm afraid, almost satanic.
*27:36.340- 27:37.640* :  You should never eat in bed.
*27:37.640- 27:38.880* :  You should never drink in bed.
*27:39.320- 27:40.900* :  It's lovingly, it's lazy.
*27:41.200- 27:42.480* :  It's the root of all evil.
*27:42.480- 27:44.720* :  It causes obesity because you're not moving,
*27:44.720- 27:47.180* :  unless you're absolutely bedridden.
*27:47.720- 27:50.200* :  And I think all meals should really be taken at the table.
*27:50.200- 27:54.080* :  Although I do allow sofa, telly, suppers.
*27:54.600- 27:56.740* :  William Sitwell and Hannah Betts.
*27:57.320- 27:59.100* :  Let's end this podcast by returning
*27:59.100- 28:01.280* :  to the US presidential election.
*28:01.780- 28:04.540* :  After last night's debate, the pop star Taylor Swift
*28:05.060- 28:07.260* :  announced she is backing Kamala Harris.
*28:07.840- 28:10.080* :  A picture of her holding a cat was captioned
*28:10.080- 28:13.440* :  with her endorsement signed Childless Cat Lady,
*28:13.880- 28:16.160* :  a mocking reference to the criticism of women
*28:16.160- 28:20.440* :  who aren't mothers by Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance.
*28:20.960- 28:24.460* :  Mr. Trump called into Fox News to share his thoughts.
*28:25.160- 28:26.880* :  I was not a Taylor Swift fan.
*28:26.880- 28:28.240* :  It was just a question of time.
*28:28.620- 28:30.080* :  She's a very liberal person.
*28:30.420- 28:32.520* :  She seems to always endorse a Democrat
*28:33.520- 28:35.620* :  and she'll probably pay a price for it
*28:35.620- 28:37.060* :  at the in the marketplace.
*28:37.560- 28:41.580* :  But celebrity endorsements are nothing new in US elections.
*28:42.180- 28:43.620* :  As on North America correspondent,
*28:43.700- 28:46.540* :  Net Atalvik explains, politicians
*28:46.540- 28:49.020* :  have long coveted celebrity star power
*28:49.020- 28:50.540* :  as they bid for the White House.
*28:50.540- 28:53.520* :  Everyone is voting for Jack.
*28:54.220- 28:58.520* :  Frank Sinatra did it his way, turning his song High Hopes
*28:58.520- 29:03.160* :  into the anthem for John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign.
*29:03.720- 29:08.940* :  High hopes is got to high hopes.
*29:09.240- 29:11.860* :  J.K. believed he was indebted to the singer.
*29:12.420- 29:14.400* :  Then a decade later, Sinatra endorsed
*29:14.400- 29:16.560* :  the actor-turned presidential candidate,
*29:16.560- 29:20.340* :  Republican Ronald Reagan, who also came out victorious.
*29:21.320- 29:25.860* :  One academic study suggests that Oprah Winfrey had a significant effect
*29:25.860- 29:28.620* :  on the 2008 Democratic primary.
*29:29.040- 29:31.380* :  I came out in the cold today to tell you
*29:31.380- 29:34.700* :  why I believe that choice needs to be Barack Obama.
*29:35.280- 29:37.500* :  Her support for the young senator at the time
*29:37.500- 29:41.540* :  over Hillary Clinton helped him become the Democratic candidate.
*29:41.540- 29:44.040* :  The study said her endorsement resulted
*29:44.040- 29:46.260* :  in more than a million votes for him.
*29:46.740- 29:48.140* :  But there were two caveats.
*29:48.520- 29:50.760* :  Oprah had unparalleled popularity
*29:50.760- 29:53.040* :  and it wasn't a general election
*29:53.040- 29:56.280* :  where voters are more concerned about policy.
*29:57.080- 30:00.700* :  This time, Donald Trump has won the backing of some celebrities,
*30:01.100- 30:03.320* :  including the former wrestler, Hulk Hogan.
*30:03.320- 30:07.880* :  I said, let Trump America from wild brother,
*30:08.380- 30:10.700* :  let Trump America rule again.
*30:11.000- 30:14.360* :  But now, attention is increasingly focused on social media.
*30:15.060- 30:17.960* :  Elon Musk uses his ex or Twitter platform
*30:17.960- 30:20.480* :  to amplify Donald Trump and his concerns.
*30:21.220- 30:23.780* :  Last month, the artist, Charlie XCX,
*30:23.780- 30:27.660* :  posted that Kamala was brat, a pop culture compliment.
*30:28.000- 30:31.420* :  You're just like that girl who is a little messy
*30:31.420- 30:34.000* :  and likes to party and like, it's brat, you're brat.
*30:34.420- 30:34.820* :  That's brat.
*30:35.320- 30:38.120* :  That inspired a whole trend of millions of memes
*30:38.120- 30:40.740* :  and videos that energized her campaign.
*30:41.440- 30:45.460* :  Taylor Swift's post has been liked more than 8 million times so far,
*30:45.460- 30:48.800* :  and she has 283 million followers.
*30:49.220- 30:51.940* :  In a tight race where swing states are decided
*30:51.940- 30:53.540* :  by the narrowest of margins,
*30:53.660- 30:57.600* :  even a slight uptick in voter engagement and registration
*30:58.260- 30:59.320* :  could make a difference.
*30:59.980- 31:00.760* :  Netta Talfik.
*31:03.760- 31:05.080* :  And that's all for most for now,
