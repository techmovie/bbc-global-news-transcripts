*02:14.800- 02:16.900* :  and steal 50 bases in a season
*02:21.540- 02:26.440* :  we start with the escalating crisis in the Middle East where fears are growing of a major
*02:26.440- 02:30.700* :  confrontation between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah
*02:31.440- 02:36.340* :  the past three days have seen some of the most intense attacks in Lebanon since the war in
*02:36.340- 02:42.240* :  Gaza started almost a year ago overnight there was an intense wave of airstrikes
*02:42.580- 02:47.840* :  as Israel targeted positions in southern Lebanon a stronghold for the Iranian-backed militant
*02:47.840- 02:52.260* :  Hezbollah group a few hours later Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel
*02:52.920- 02:57.920* :  the Lebanese economy minister Amim Salam says the situation is escalating by the
*02:57.920- 03:04.460* :  hour and having terrible consequences from the security perspective it's been really outrageous
*03:04.460- 03:11.180* :  what happened and this attack has hit a lot of civilians including young people and women
*03:11.180- 03:17.780* :  and children on the same front the economy is another dimension that is being deeply affected
*03:17.840- 03:25.080* :  by this escalation now this adds another layer that really stops growth stops any flow of cash
*03:25.080- 03:31.860* :  related to investment stops any visits to Lebanon from tourists and puts us in a very tough
*03:31.900- 03:38.680* :  place now in the economy and on the security front the past three months I would say that
*03:38.680- 03:46.380* :  witnessed the major escalations in Lebanon has really decreased the number of people visiting
*03:46.380- 03:53.100* :  Lebanon even the Lebanese diaspora which has known to be the largest that really contributes to
*03:53.100- 03:58.940* :  the economy these latest bombardments came just hours after the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah
*03:59.360- 04:04.740* :  vowed to punish Israel which he blamed for attacking the group's pages and walkie talkies
*04:04.740- 04:11.080* :  in a coordinated attack which killed nearly 40 people and injured 3,000 we've been hearing
*04:11.080- 04:16.560* :  reaction about the escalation of violence from frightened residents in Lebanon this is Rafahela
*04:17.020- 04:23.400* :  what is going on here is terrifying it's like if we were inside the horror movie our long
*04:23.400- 04:31.740* :  terrifying dream we are hostages yes we are hostages people do not have the means to survive
*04:31.740- 04:40.500* :  neither materially or morally and our politicians have failed us the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*04:40.500- 04:46.360* :  Netanyahu has vowed to return tens of thousands of residents evacuated from the northern border
*04:46.360- 04:52.960* :  areas to their homes or Talberti is among them basically I have two kids my partner is in reserves
*04:53.600- 05:00.100* :  then we live in a hotel room which is around 21 meters square next to the sea of Galilee
*05:00.880- 05:06.000* :  I was born on the border with Lebanon my mother was born there I have friends in Lebanon
*05:06.560- 05:12.220* :  they know that we don't want this war none of us asked for it shortly before we recorded this
*05:12.220- 05:18.420* :  podcast we had from our correspondent Yolanda Nell in Jerusalem what we're hearing from the north
*05:18.420- 05:26.440* :  of Israel about 150 rockets fired by Hezbollah the Israeli military renewing its call for residents
*05:26.440- 05:33.360* :  to stay close to bomb shelters this is really after we've had in the past 24 hours some very
*05:33.360- 05:40.760* :  serious exchanges of fire and we've had overnight the Israeli military saying that it hit about
*05:40.760- 05:45.680* :  a hundred rocket launch sites in the south of Lebanon that it took out a thousand launch
*05:45.680- 05:51.600* :  barrels ready to be fired at northern Israel other Hezbollah infrastructure and the reports are
*05:51.600- 05:57.220* :  really this was the strongest bombing that we've seen the heaviest bombing of southern Lebanon
*05:57.220- 06:05.780* :  since the 7th of October last year that's when Hezbollah really began its firing of rockets at Israel
*06:05.780- 06:13.000* :  in support of Hamas in the Gaza Strip so there has been fighting going on along this border
*06:13.380- 06:18.360* :  in parallel to the war in Gaza and what about the military build up that we were hearing was
*06:18.800- 06:23.660* :  happening in the north is that still going on well interestingly the Israeli military is not
*06:23.660- 06:30.180* :  commenting too much openly on it but as fighting in Gaza has slowed we have seen that Israel has
*06:30.180- 06:35.280* :  been strengthening its forces along the border with Lebanon and we know that this week there's
*06:35.280- 06:40.680* :  been this powerful army division the 98th division that took part in some of the heaviest
*06:40.680- 06:47.200* :  fighting in Gaza moved up to northern Israel and that is said to include thousands of troops
*06:47.200- 06:53.220* :  that's not something that has been confirmed by Israeli military officials but this is what is
*06:53.220- 06:59.660* :  being widely reported and it's really you know clear to the military has said it staged a series
*06:59.660- 07:05.060* :  of drills along the border it wants to show that it is ready for what is what is called a new phase
*07:05.060- 07:10.900* :  of the war and we're hearing that there's going to be a probe into this video that's been online of
*07:10.900- 07:17.680* :  soldiers throwing bodies from the roof of a building in the West Bank now of course under international
*07:17.680- 07:25.560* :  law respecting bodies of the dead even if they're those of your enemies in a war situation
*07:25.580- 07:32.300* :  that is is a requirement under international law and that's why these Israeli military has come
*07:32.300- 07:38.240* :  out saying that this is not in accordance with its values and what it expects of its soldiers.
*07:42.040- 07:45.800* :  The European Union is to lend Ukraine nearly 40 billion dollars
*07:46.160- 07:50.700* :  President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested the money would go towards repairing Ukraine's
*07:50.700- 07:56.140* :  energy infrastructure which has been repeatedly struck by Russian drone and missile attacks
*07:56.140- 08:01.280* :  as well as crucial air defenses and drone production. Jessica Parker has more details.
*08:01.900- 08:06.260* :  The funds were announced by EU Chief Ursula von der Leyen at a news conference alongside
*08:06.260- 08:12.860* :  President Zelensky. This is part of an as yet unrealized scheme by wealthy G7 nations
*08:12.860- 08:18.320* :  to raise 50 billion dollars for Ukraine from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets.
*08:18.380- 08:22.940* :  Speaking on a visit to Kiev, Ms. von der Leyen said she was absolutely confident
*08:22.940- 08:28.400* :  that other nations would do their bit. The EU's aim is to start releasing it share of the money by
*08:28.400- 08:34.420* :  the end of the year. Jessica Parker, it's difficult to get hold of official statistics about the
*08:34.420- 08:40.000* :  number of people who have been killed fighting for Russia in Ukraine but what researchers can do
*08:40.320- 08:44.040* :  is look at such things as online obituaries posted by their families.
*08:44.760- 08:51.080* :  Now the BBC working with a Russian independent website has identified more than 70,000 people
*08:51.080- 08:55.900* :  who have died fighting in Russia's military since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
*08:56.600- 08:59.080* :  Olga Ifshiner of BBC Russian has this report.
*08:59.920- 09:05.800* :  The faces of Russian fighters killed in Ukraine are changing. Now more and more men in the
*09:05.800- 09:10.280* :  40s, 50s and even 60s are volunteering for the front line.
*09:11.180- 09:16.580* :  62-year-old Renat Husnyyarov was one of them. Before he volunteered, he had two jobs.
*09:17.240- 09:22.420* :  Fighting for Russia, he earned seven times what he did before. Russian authorities have repeatedly
*09:22.420- 09:29.200* :  increased sign-up bonuses to attract men like Renat. He died in February this year. We don't
*09:29.200- 09:33.380* :  know where exactly but thousands kilometers away from his home in Russia.
*09:36.300- 09:41.560* :  Last month Russian forces faced a Ukrainian offensive in Kursk, the first on Russian territory.
*09:42.520- 09:47.200* :  The Kremlin claims this attack has encouraged more volunteers to sign-up to fight.
*09:48.960- 09:52.200* :  There are no official figures on the numbers of Russian killed,
*09:52.580- 09:57.920* :  so since the start of the war the BBC and its partner media Zona have been trying to build a
*09:57.920- 10:02.380* :  picture of what's happening on the front lines. We have been using photos of graves,
*10:02.380- 10:07.720* :  social media posts and news articles to uncover the scale of Russian losses.
*10:09.320- 10:14.600* :  So far we have managed to verify that 70,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war.
*10:14.920- 10:20.220* :  The recent figures also show that for the first time the largest group of men dying are volunteers,
*10:20.780- 10:25.660* :  not regular soldiers or convicts, but men who have signed up after the start of the full scale
*10:25.660- 10:31.060* :  invasion in February 2022. A study from the Russian Ministry of Defense
*10:31.060- 10:37.000* :  seen by the BBC suggests that many of those deaths could be avoided with better first aid and
*10:37.000- 10:44.180* :  medical care. Moscow continues to use so-called mid-grind attacks trying to wear down Ukrainian forces.
*10:44.840- 10:48.980* :  And volunteers now seem to be used at the most challenging parts of the front line.
*10:49.560- 10:55.600* :  Our data shows that volunteers are now dying at a faster rate than in the first two years of the war.
*10:58.920- 11:04.580* :  This spike in the number killed coincides with the Russian offense on Avdivka in the east of Ukraine.
*11:05.420- 11:08.220* :  It was one of the deadliest confrontations in this war.
*11:09.460- 11:15.540* :  Having lost thousands of troops, Russia was able to take ruins of Avdivka in early 2024.
*11:18.040- 11:24.220* :  As our count only includes deaths reported publicly, the true figure of losses is significantly higher.
*11:24.820- 11:27.220* :  Asked for comment the Russian government did not respond.
*11:29.180- 11:34.520* :  Early this year, Ukraine acknowledged 31,000 soldiers had been killed, but estimates from the US
*11:34.520- 11:41.940* :  intelligence suggest the number is higher. Moscow continues to push on, willing to exchange
*11:41.940- 11:45.540* :  thousands of lives for small pieces of scattered land.
*12:11.060- 12:17.820* :  The Japanese player, Shohei Otani, has become the first US major league player to achieve 50 home runs
*12:17.820- 12:23.680* :  and 50 stolen bases in a single season. Otani hit the record for the Los Angeles Dodgers
*12:24.120- 12:27.300* :  with a seventh-inning home run against the Marlins in Miami.
*12:28.180- 12:32.080* :  Someone who is very excited about this is our business reporter, Mariko Oy.
*12:32.080- 12:34.560* :  She is Japanese and a baseball fan.
*12:34.560- 12:38.020* :  So first, we asked her to explain this 50-50 club.
*12:38.620- 12:43.080* :  I will try, Jackie, because I actually haven't actually talked about baseball in English.
*12:43.080- 12:47.540* :  I only talk about baseball in Japanese and every time I have to cover sport, you know, as he said,
*12:47.540- 12:52.080* :  I'm a business journalist. So every time I had to cover like rugby, I had to learn all the terminologies,
*12:52.080- 12:58.960* :  but basically, stolen bases is when a player runs from one of the bases to the next one,
*12:59.020- 13:01.900* :  while the pitcher is throwing a ball. Does that make sense?
*13:02.180- 13:07.260* :  And the pitcher doesn't, you know, manage to hit. So the player actually steals the next
*13:07.260- 13:11.700* :  base when, you know, he doesn't actually deserve to be except for the fact that he runs so fast
*13:11.700- 13:16.720* :  that he's managed to get it. And home run obviously is a big hit that goes across the wall.
*13:17.160- 13:20.600* :  Incredible news. I mean, you know, it's my daughter's birthday and
*13:20.620- 13:24.260* :  but when my parents called this morning, all I could hear was their scream.
*13:24.260- 13:25.820* :  But oh my gosh, she's done it.
*13:26.260- 13:31.160* :  But also, what I thought was fascinating was after inventing that 50-50 club,
*13:31.160- 13:35.120* :  he then hits another home run and then he steals another base.
*13:35.120- 13:41.260* :  So it's now 51-51 and MLB, you know, posted on Twitter, slash ex saying,
*13:41.260- 13:49.520* :  oh, 51-51, LOL. So 60, 60 next, you know, anyone. So incredible achievement. Very excited.
*13:49.920- 13:52.680* :  So tell us a little bit more about Shohei Otani.
*13:53.680- 13:59.120* :  I mean, he's obviously been a baseball sensation. He's always been big in Japan, but obviously,
*13:59.120- 14:06.420* :  he's he's signed that massive contract, record contract worth $700 million last year
*14:06.700- 14:11.920* :  joined the Los Angeles Dodgers. And since then, he's been doing incredibly well.
*14:11.920- 14:16.920* :  And what's quite amazing about his achievement this time is that he's actually still recovering
*14:16.920- 14:21.940* :  as a as a picture. He's got an injury and he had an operation. So he's doing all sorts of
*14:21.940- 14:27.700* :  rehabilitation as a picture, but as a hitter, he's been doing achieving so many different things.
*14:27.820- 14:32.380* :  And that's that's what makes him amazing. But at the same time, you know, given I am a business
*14:32.380- 14:37.140* :  journalist, I can also talk about numbers and money and the economy contribution that he's
*14:37.140- 14:43.160* :  been making to LA, but also to Japan, you know, the ticket sales, all the advertisement that
*14:43.160- 14:48.100* :  Japanese companies have been spending millions of dollars to advertise against at stadium,
*14:48.660- 14:52.280* :  an amazing baseball and also a great contributor to the economy.
*14:52.860- 14:55.480* :  That was Mariko Oy and happy birthday to her daughter.
*14:56.320- 15:01.700* :  Now, are you the parent of a fussy eater or perhaps you were that child who had a tantrum
*15:02.020- 15:06.540* :  at the prospect of eating green vegetables? Well, scientists here in the UK have found that
*15:06.540- 15:12.920* :  fussy eaters are the way they are, mainly because of their genes. So parents aren't to blame,
*15:12.920- 15:18.200* :  well, not directly anyway. My colleague, Amol Rajan, has been speaking to Dr. Claire Lou Wellen,
*15:18.200- 15:24.120* :  who is professor of psychology and epidemiology at University College London and senior author of
*15:24.120- 15:29.940* :  the study. We found that individual differences between children ranging from toddlerhood all the way
*15:29.940- 15:35.580* :  to early adolescence and how they respond to the opportunities to try new foods and a range of
*15:35.580- 15:41.220* :  different foods with Texas and flavours. Those individual differences have a strong genetic component
*15:41.220- 15:46.380* :  to them. So the reason why some children are quite finicky with trying certain sorts of
*15:46.380- 15:50.100* :  foods and new foods and other children are really adventurous and they happily join in with
*15:50.460- 15:56.780* :  family meals is largely down to genetic differences between children rather than parenting styles.
*15:57.060- 16:05.920* :  Few. So for doing you study twins to ascertain this stuff? We did. So we studied fussy eating in a large
*16:05.920- 16:12.480* :  population-based cohort of families and twins in England and Wales and we measured fussy eating
*16:12.480- 16:18.080* :  in toddlerhood at 16 months of age, three years, five years, seven years, and in early adolescence,
*16:18.080- 16:24.600* :  at 12 to 13 years. And we compared how similar identical twins are, who are 100% genetically
*16:24.600- 16:29.960* :  the same, with non-identical twins who share about 50% of their genes. And what we found was that
*16:29.960- 16:35.480* :  the identical twins were much more similar at all of the different ages in their tendency to be a
*16:35.480- 16:39.540* :  bit fussy around. So this is going to make some parents feel less guilty, but those parents may also
*16:39.540- 16:44.320* :  want some help. Did you find any evidence of what works in trying to get these, these little
*16:44.320- 16:49.280* :  critters to eat your parsnip or whatever it might be? So that wasn't the focus of this particular
*16:49.280- 16:54.720* :  study, but there has been a lot of other research into the sort of practical strategies that parents
*16:54.720- 16:59.320* :  can use. And there are three things that have a lot of evidence behind them. So firstly,
*16:59.320- 17:06.000* :  what we call repeated exposure, which is offering your child that particular food they reject very
*17:06.000- 17:11.200* :  regularly without coercion and an environment where they feel quite calm. That doesn't have to
*17:11.200- 17:16.700* :  be meal time. And eventually children will often try the food and then they'll start to eat it
*17:16.700- 17:22.380* :  more frequently, continue to offer a wide variety of food. So don't stop, don't give up just because
*17:22.380- 17:27.260* :  of child eats a limited range of foods. And if you want your child to eat what you eat a family meal
*17:27.260- 17:31.760* :  sit down with your child as often as you can and eat with your child and try not to get too stress.
*17:31.760- 17:41.140* :  That was Dr Claire Llewellen. Still to come. We have received applications for a lot of marathon
*17:41.140- 17:48.380* :  at best attempts at the longest time to hug a tree. The rise of obscure world record attempts
*17:56.880- 17:59.940* :  in West Africa. Millions of people have lost weight with personalized plans for

*18:29.620- 18:34.640* :  the hunt. These aren't your average orcas. These guys are organized.
*18:35.820- 18:39.320* :  Marketing team, did you get those social media posts scheduled for the CO migration?
*18:40.180- 18:44.740* :  Hi, I, Captain. We even have an automated notification for all pod managers when they go live.
*18:45.540- 18:50.080* :  They use Monday.com to keep their teamwork sharp, their communication clear, and their goals in

*19:02.200- 19:08.300* :  Now to what's being described as the catastrophic situation in Haiti, gang has control most of
*19:08.300- 19:12.660* :  the capital, port of Prince, and their influence also stretches across much of the country.
*19:13.260- 19:17.200* :  The ongoing violence has displaced more than half a million people in recent years.
*19:17.880- 19:22.760* :  A Kenyan-led multinational security force has been helping the Haitian police tackle the
*19:22.760- 19:28.640* :  gangs. Some gang leaders have been rounded up, but the criminal organisations remain very powerful.
*19:29.380- 19:35.840* :  There are plans for an election in two years, the first since 2016, but a UN official William O'Neill
*19:35.840- 19:41.900* :  is warning that no election will be possible until the security situation is brought under control.
*19:42.480- 19:47.700* :  Mr O'Neill has just returned from a 12-day fact-finding mission to Haiti, and he spoke to the BBC.
*19:48.520- 19:53.680* :  My presence on the situation is catastrophic. It's worse than when I was here last year in October
*19:53.680- 19:59.780* :  November. The security situation is very bad. The situation for the humanitarian issues like
*19:59.780- 20:06.240* :  access to food, healthcare, water is much worse. I was in the southern peninsula, which is
*20:06.240- 20:10.820* :  totally cut off from the rest of the country. By about a thousand gang members are holding about
*20:10.820- 20:17.180* :  four million people hostage who live on the southern branch of Haiti. There's no way to get out
*20:17.180- 20:23.280* :  there other than by air that's safe and boats sometimes, but the gangs now hijacked boats,
*20:23.840- 20:27.640* :  and the one-meter road that leads out of the capital to the whole southern region is controlled by
*20:27.640- 20:32.420* :  gangs and they've cut it off. When you say that things got worse since your last visit, how do you
*20:32.420- 20:38.420* :  explain that? I think a lot of it has to do with the crisis for about four months from late February
*20:38.420- 20:44.700* :  into early June when the gangs really did almost take over the whole city. The former Prime Minister
*20:44.700- 20:50.580* :  was never able to get back into the country. Time is against reform. Time works in the gangs
*20:50.580- 20:55.260* :  favor. The gangs have used that time to replenish their arms and munitions, most of which come from
*20:55.260- 20:59.600* :  the United States. I think it's a shocking failure of the part of the United States to stop these
*20:59.600- 21:04.160* :  weapons from getting here, and so they've been able to get stronger. The new government, which
*21:04.160- 21:09.060* :  really started working in early mid-late June, is still finding its way. They have a totally
*21:09.060- 21:13.040* :  different approach I have to say. I met with the previous Prime Minister. I met with the current
*21:13.040- 21:18.040* :  Prime Minister, Gary Coney. It's a totally different ballgame. Prime Minister Coney is very committed
*21:18.040- 21:23.940* :  to bringing chain to trying to get things right here, but it's complicated. It's hard. He doesn't
*21:23.940- 21:28.540* :  have that enough of anything. Nobody has enough of anything. That's the problem on the good guy's side.
*21:28.540- 21:33.480* :  If I could use that term, whereas the bad guys have lots of things. Unless you get the
*21:33.480- 21:38.660* :  security situation under control, nothing else is possible here. They're talking about schools
*21:38.660- 21:43.780* :  reopening on October 1st. They already delayed that by about a month. Five, six million people
*21:44.180- 21:48.540* :  are food insecure on the verge of famine. Most of the hospitals in Port-au-Prince aren't working,
*21:49.160- 21:56.340* :  so you can sense, I think, the frustration and anger in my voice, but it's outrageous as this
*21:56.340- 22:00.180* :  has gotten to this point. The Secretary General of the other day made a very strong statement,
*22:00.180- 22:04.940* :  I thought, saying, you know, Haiti shouldn't be this difficult. It's not that big. It's not
*22:04.940- 22:09.780* :  Sudan. It's not Ukraine. And it's not that much money that's required both to fund the
*22:09.780- 22:13.880* :  international force and to fund the humanitarian appeal, which is at a shockingly low,
*22:14.300- 22:19.180* :  about 20 percent has been pledged. And we're not talking about lots and lots of money on international
*22:19.180- 22:23.680* :  scale. It's peanuts, but it's not there. And that's a scandal, frankly.
*22:23.960- 22:28.540* :  In these really atrocious, deplorable conditions that you depict so vividly,
*22:29.020- 22:32.200* :  how do people survive? How do ordinary people get by?
*22:32.980- 22:38.060* :  I asked myself that every day we visited up displaced persons sight in the city. People have
*22:38.060- 22:43.060* :  been forced to flee their own other part of Port-au-Prince. The living conditions for them are
*22:43.340- 22:48.260* :  unbelievably dire. They're under tarps when it rains. It's flooding. There's water,
*22:48.260- 22:54.240* :  that's standing water. There's hard toilets. They don't get food. I honestly don't know how
*22:55.040- 22:58.620* :  the average hate can get through one day, let alone day after day.
*22:59.020- 23:04.000* :  That was William O'Neal, and he was talking to James Coppnell. Now, in this pod yesterday, we heard
*23:04.000- 23:09.060* :  from the US special envoy to Sudan, Tom Perielo, and he told us that the Biden administration
*23:09.060- 23:15.420* :  was maintaining pressure on warring parties to try to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Sudan.
*23:15.420- 23:21.180* :  He said more aid was now getting in, but not enough. So what is the situation right now?
*23:21.880- 23:27.740* :  At least 12 million people are displaced. Close to 25 million people face acute hunger and
*23:27.740- 23:35.600* :  need urgent help as famine looms. Some estimates suggest that 2.5 million people could die in Sudan
*23:35.600- 23:42.460* :  before the end of the year. Amol Rajan spoke to Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the
*23:42.460- 23:48.840* :  Yale Humanitarian Research Lab. He has been tracking the conflict in Sudan, and particularly in
*23:48.840- 23:55.340* :  Elfasha, where the UN says there's been an escalation in fighting. Elfasha is a crossroad city
*23:55.560- 24:01.440* :  at the intersection of four roads in North Star 4. It is before the current conflict. It was
*24:02.100- 24:12.460* :  the last safe haven for Zagawa, for and Masalee, local African people who had fled previous violence.
*24:13.180- 24:19.000* :  And it was home to three of the largest internally displaced camps in Sudan,
*24:19.000- 24:25.140* :  and arguably in the case of Zamzam, one of the largest internally displaced camps in East Africa.
*24:25.860- 24:29.900* :  And I know that using this high resolution imagery, using open communication,
*24:29.900- 24:35.040* :  you're able to monitor closely what's happening in areas like Elfasha. What are you seeing?
*24:35.740- 24:41.240* :  Since Friday, we are seeing basically the eruption of what you can call free fire zone.
*24:41.800- 24:48.680* :  Sudan armed forces have launched at least over 48 different air strikes, if not more,
*24:48.700- 24:54.380* :  primarily using ground strike fighters and attack helicopters. And right now, the Sudan armed
*24:54.380- 24:59.920* :  forces basically have their back to the wall. They're stuck in a corner of the city. And now the
*24:59.920- 25:05.840* :  question is, is RSF breaking through? If they do, Elfasha may fall soon.
*25:06.640- 25:10.620* :  What is the overall humanitarian situation in this giant country, which of course
*25:10.620- 25:15.860* :  was split into the creation of South Sudan a few years ago? It is several different disasters
*25:15.860- 25:21.380* :  all happening at once. There's an outbreak of cholera that's killed at least according to health
*25:21.380- 25:27.680* :  officials, over 10,000, cartoon and under mom, the twin cities of the capital have been basically
*25:27.680- 25:34.280* :  late to waste. Think of Aleppo and Syria. And then in Darfur, there's been a series of massacres
*25:34.280- 25:41.380* :  since the war started last year, including the El Janena killings, which according to the U.N.
*25:41.420- 25:46.840* :  may have killed as many as 15,000 mosleys. We're also seeing historically high floods.
*25:47.740- 25:53.540* :  And that has complicated the ability of the U.N. to reach those desperately in need with supplies.
*25:53.540- 25:59.760* :  In the case of Zamzam and Elfasha, what is called integrative phase classification five,
*25:59.760- 26:05.280* :  otherwise known spam and has been declared, and those conditions are spreading throughout the
*26:05.320- 26:10.020* :  country. And this is affecting just a people understand, this is affecting well over 10 million
*26:10.020- 26:15.980* :  people, many of them facing extreme malnutrition, many of those children. That's correct. And
*26:15.980- 26:21.040* :  Sudan is now the largest displacement crisis in the world, bigger than Gaza, bigger than Ukraine.
*26:21.820- 26:28.420* :  Nathaniel Raymond. Here in the UK, lawyers representing some of the 37 women who have accused
*26:28.420- 26:34.200* :  Muhammad al-Faird of rape and sexual assault have described the late Harrods owner as a monster,
*26:34.200- 26:40.380* :  whose behaviour was enabled by the luxury department store. Speaking at a news conference in London,
*26:40.380- 26:46.100* :  one of his alleged victims, Natasha, explained what would happen when she was asked to attend
*26:46.100- 26:51.340* :  a private meeting. And I should warn you that her account is disturbing. A forced kiss,
*26:52.400- 26:57.700* :  his hands gripping your face to his lips, or pulling you down on his lap, where his hands were
*26:57.700- 27:04.600* :  free to explore any part of your body that he wished. These incidents lasted seconds, but the fear
*27:04.600- 27:10.360* :  installed left me paralyzed. But I was always reminded not to mention them to anyone. He would know
*27:10.360- 27:18.220* :  if I did. The legal teams said the billionaire who died last year, aged 94, had set up a system in
*27:18.220- 27:23.840* :  which young women were recruited, so he could assault them. One of the baristas representing the
*27:23.840- 27:30.440* :  women, Maria Muller, says some of them were threatened by Mr. Al-Faird's security team to keep quiet.
*27:30.920- 27:37.280* :  If they ever attempted to complain about the sexual assaults, we know that they would receive threats
*27:37.280- 27:44.220* :  along the lines of, you'll never work in London again. I know where you and your family live.
*27:45.100- 27:47.260* :  Francis Reed has been following developments.
*27:48.040- 27:53.780* :  Mohamed Al-Faird was not just a billionaire. He was a significant figure in British society
*27:53.780- 27:59.640* :  as the boss of Harrods and then as the owner of Fullham Football Club. But allegations about his
*27:59.640- 28:05.080* :  behaviour towards female staff at the department store, including sexual harassment and rape
*28:05.080- 28:11.120* :  are growing. Multiple women have contacted the BBC. In the news conference, their legal teams
*28:11.120- 28:16.800* :  described Mohamed Al-Faird as a monster and a predator who was enabled by those around him.
*28:16.920- 28:21.640* :  The lawyers said the luxury department store had full culpability for the abuse,
*28:21.640- 28:27.220* :  also describing unnecessary and intrusive medical examinations for female employees.
*28:27.260- 28:32.060* :  They compared the case to horrific cases that involved high-profile offenders,
*28:32.700- 28:37.440* :  such as Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein and Jimmy Savile, and said their single aim
*28:37.440- 28:42.400* :  was to seek justice for the survivors. The current owners of Harrods says it has a settlement
*28:42.400- 28:47.800* :  process available to women who say they were attacked by Mr Al-Faird, insisting the business
*28:47.800- 28:55.380* :  is very different now. That was Francis Reed. For some, it represents a wonderfully pristine habitat
*28:55.380- 29:01.200* :  for marine life. The waters around the Arctic play host to everything from whales and dolphins
*29:01.200- 29:07.600* :  to strange-looking sea sponges, as well as coral reefs. But under the sea bed, there's something
*29:07.600- 29:13.700* :  else, vast supplies of minerals, including rare earth metals, which Norway wants to extract.
*29:13.740- 29:19.140* :  Another campaign group, Greenpeace, has warned that plans to do this risk-causing,
*29:19.140- 29:23.980* :  permanent damage. Our Europe regional editor, Paul Moss, is following the story.
*29:24.520- 29:29.980* :  The minerals that are there in the sea bed are things like copper, nickel, cobalt and rare earth
*29:29.980- 29:35.780* :  metals. Now, these have always been valuable, but now more than ever, why? Well, because we're
*29:35.780- 29:40.600* :  trying to increase the number of electric cars in the world, these need batteries, and these
*29:40.600- 29:45.360* :  metals are needed for the batteries they put in electric cars and in other industrial products
*29:45.360- 29:50.840* :  that use renewable energy. But there's something else, increasingly, countries are trying to ensure
*29:50.840- 29:56.920* :  they have secure supplies of the resources they need when Russia invaded Ukraine. It made a few
*29:56.920- 30:01.440* :  countries sit up and go, hold on, we're dependent on Russia for huge amounts of our gas and we
*30:01.440- 30:06.980* :  can't necessarily rely on it. A lot of these metals I'm talking about are actually there in China,
*30:07.420- 30:11.200* :  and again, there's a fear of future conflict with China, would mean you couldn't rely on supplies.
*30:11.200- 30:16.220* :  They're also Russia and China gaining influence in parts of Africa, where these metals are found.
*30:16.220- 30:21.260* :  Again, fear that they could then hold the world to ransom. So, for proponents of sea mining,
*30:21.260- 30:25.400* :  sea bed mining, this is a win-win. There they are, the metals under the sea, close to home.
*30:26.060- 30:31.040* :  They also argue that sea mining is less damaging to the environment than digging up the land.
*30:31.060- 30:35.160* :  I mean, there's another example. Indonesia currently supplies a lot of the world's nickel,
*30:35.640- 30:40.280* :  but mining that has meant destroying vast tracts of rainforest. They say better to get it from
*30:40.280- 30:44.820* :  under the sea. Okay, so what's green piece's objection then? Well, they say digging up the sea bed,
*30:44.820- 30:49.660* :  there may be less visible damage, but it's actually devastating nonetheless. I mean, the more we
*30:49.660- 30:54.900* :  learn about the sea and his other habitats, you more you understand that these are complex ecosystems,
*30:55.740- 31:00.380* :  different species interacting with each other. If you go and destroy one part of it,
*31:00.640- 31:05.120* :  you cause a cascade of problems, which will destroy all mean marine life. They're also worried
*31:05.120- 31:09.720* :  about accidents. We'll already dig up one mineral from the sea under the sea and that's oil.
*31:10.100- 31:14.260* :  Look at all the oil rigs they say that go wrong. It could happen with this deep metal mining.
*31:14.700- 31:18.760* :  And just finally, is green piece alone in its objections? No, not at all. In fact, Britain and
*31:18.760- 31:23.820* :  France and some other countries have called for an international moratorium on all sea bed mining.
*31:23.820- 31:28.960* :  The European Parliament issued a warning to Norway saying, don't do this, you could harm fisheries,
*31:28.960- 31:33.940* :  for example, they also worry that if Norway goes ahead, that will encourage other countries
*31:33.980- 31:37.980* :  around the world to start digging up their sea beds. We just don't understand the risks
*31:37.980- 31:42.940* :  sufficiently they say. That's Paul Moss. And finally, let's talk about
*31:42.940- 31:49.360* :  cookethons, speechethons and skipethons, because Guinness World Records says it's seeing a
*31:49.360- 31:54.640* :  staggering increase in attempts to make and break new records from West Africa. It really kicked
*31:54.640- 32:00.320* :  off last year in Nigeria. At one point, the Guinness World Records social media account even
*32:00.320- 32:06.580* :  humorously posted enough of the recordethons. But the mania is showing no signs of slowing down.
*32:06.580- 32:11.320* :  Richard Hamilton reports on the activities with which people are trying to beat the world.
*32:19.760- 32:26.140* :  In May last year, a young Nigerian chef, Hilda Bassi, smashed the world record for marathon
*32:26.140- 32:34.560* :  cooking. She spent 93 hours and 11 minutes preparing, frying, baking and roasting local dishes.
*32:35.160- 32:41.180* :  Her attempt was supported by celebrities and politicians in Nigeria and attracted millions
*32:41.180- 32:47.840* :  on social media. The Guinness World Records website even slowed down for days as thousands
*32:47.840- 32:55.660* :  went online to follow her progress. The interest in West Africa specifically really blew up once
*32:55.760- 33:02.360* :  Hilda Bassi had made her attempt for the longest cooking marathon and then ultimately being awarded
*33:02.460- 33:08.580* :  with it. Mark McKinley is the director of Central Records Services at Guinness World Records.
*33:08.620- 33:15.700* :  He says the engagement from West Africa has reached historic levels since the Bassi cookethon.
*33:16.140- 33:23.600* :  So we've seen many, many applications. So applications coming in for a variety of record titles
*33:24.060- 33:31.220* :  and excitingly a number of applications actually becoming record holders. So we're seeing more record
*33:31.220- 33:37.580* :  holders from that region than we that we ever have. We have received applications for a lot of
*33:37.580- 33:44.400* :  marathon ed based attempts. So we awarded a record relatively recently for the longest time to
*33:44.400- 33:51.420* :  hug a tree. There was three young men from Nigeria who did a variety of skipping records. So the most
*33:51.420- 34:00.440* :  rope crossovers skipping on one leg in 30 seconds. Between 2013 and 2022, there were about 7,000
*34:00.440- 34:08.020* :  applications from West Africa representing 1 percent of the global tally. But since 2023,
*34:08.820- 34:14.400* :  roughly the same number of applications have been received or about 8 percent of the total.
*34:15.160- 34:21.240* :  In the 1990s, the Guinness Book of Records, as it was known then, was popular in middle class
*34:21.240- 34:27.580* :  West African households. But Hilda Bassi has reintroduced it to the TikTok generation.
*34:28.700- 34:35.240* :  The rise in West Africa is also partly because it's seen as a short cut to fame and riches
*34:35.840- 34:42.140* :  in a region suffering from poverty and record unemployment. Although record breakers are not paid,
*34:42.140- 34:49.140* :  Hilda Bassi received several endorsement deals. And the marathon genre has proved particularly
*34:49.140- 34:56.820* :  popular despite some health risks. A Camaroonian blogger went temporarily blind during a crying
*34:57.420- 35:03.840* :  marathon. A Lagos masseuse collapsed in the middle of a massage endurance attempt. And the authorities
*35:03.840- 35:11.420* :  in southwest Nigeria banned a kissing marathon. Other unusual attempts include a 200-hour
