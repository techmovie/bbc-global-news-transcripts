*01:19.120- 01:22.300* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.120- 01:29.860* :  I'm Paul Moss and at 1300 GMT on Tuesday, 3rd of September, these are our main stories.
*01:30.360- 01:36.340* :  A Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian city of Poltava has killed more than 40 people and
*01:36.340- 01:42.700* :  injured almost 200 more. Officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo say almost 130
*01:42.700- 01:48.460* :  prisoners were killed during an attempted jail break. And the former chief executive of Volkswagen
*01:48.460- 01:54.460* :  is going on trial. Nine years after the carmaker was found to have cheated laboratory tests on
*01:54.460- 02:08.220* :  the vehicle's emissions. Also in this podcast, Mongolia welcomes President Putin. But will he be arrested there?
*02:12.940- 02:18.260* :  As we record this podcast, news is coming in of a Russian missile strike that according to
*02:18.260- 02:23.720* :  Ukraine's President Zelensky has killed more than 40 people. The target was Poltava,
*02:23.720- 02:29.820* :  a city in the center of Ukraine. More than 180 people were wounded. Speaking in the last hour,
*02:29.820- 02:35.460* :  Mr. Zelensky said it was a very difficult day for Ukraine. We got more details from the BBC
*02:35.460- 02:41.820* :  monitoring team's Russia and Ukraine specialist Vitaly Shevchenko. The Ukrainian President said that
*02:41.820- 02:49.180* :  it was carried out using two ballistic missiles. And it hit an educational establishment,
*02:49.180- 02:54.920* :  which are called an Institute of Communications. Now there are indications that this institute was
*02:55.400- 03:01.200* :  used by the Ukrainian military to train to use communications on the battlefield. So there are reports
*03:01.200- 03:08.440* :  that the strike targeted Ukrainian military. The defence ministry in Kiev also issued a statement
*03:08.440- 03:15.900* :  saying that it's an awful day in Poltava. And these people were hit while on their way to the
*03:15.900- 03:21.940* :  bomb shelter. So they did not have enough time to evacuate. Many were trapped under the rubble.
*03:21.980- 03:28.760* :  The Ukraine military says that 25 people had been rescued and search and rescue operations
*03:28.760- 03:37.140* :  are still ongoing. Now, Poltava is fairly removed from the front line. So it's not seen the
*03:37.540- 03:43.420* :  most vicious Russian missile attacks, unlike some of the Ukrainian cities in the east and northeast
*03:43.420- 03:49.260* :  in Ukraine, such as Kharkiv. Now that's all changed. Clearly tragic developments in Poltava.
*03:49.260- 03:55.880* :  Three days of mourning have been declared in the city. Ukraine is trying to find out how this
*03:55.880- 04:02.580* :  happened just at a time when it's trying to improve its air defenses. Ever since Ukraine had
*04:02.860- 04:07.860* :  launched that incursion into Russia, there's been speculation that Vladimir Putin would want to
*04:07.860- 04:13.340* :  hit back at Ukraine in a way that caused more serious casualties than in the past, perhaps as a
*04:13.340- 04:19.620* :  form of punishment. Is it possible that that's what we're seeing here? It is possible, Polt, but
*04:19.620- 04:26.020* :  let's not forget that this and earlier massive missile strikes that Russia has been carrying out
*04:26.700- 04:32.800* :  over the past weeks. They are parts of Russia's previous strategy. There are nothing that Russia
*04:32.800- 04:39.000* :  has not done before. So it could also, just as equally be argued, that Russia would have
*04:39.700- 04:43.740* :  tried to do something like that anyway. Kursk or no, Kursk.
*04:44.440- 04:50.720* :  Vitaly Shevchenko. Today's attack comes after a weekend of extensive drone strikes carried out
*04:50.720- 04:56.460* :  by Ukraine on Russia. They targeted a refinery and power station deep within the country.
*04:57.100- 05:02.520* :  The Kremlin claims the majority of the drones were intercepted. James Patton Rodgers is executive
*05:02.520- 05:08.520* :  director of the Cornell Brooks Tech Policy Institute and has advised NATO and the United Nations
*05:08.520- 05:14.420* :  on drone warfare in the past. He told the BBC's Catherine Vieira-Hunga how Ukraine had attempted
*05:14.420- 05:21.100* :  to match Russia's drone capabilities. Russia does rely quite heavily on Iran's for its drone
*05:21.800- 05:29.240* :  designs, for its supply of drones, but Ukraine has tried to match this capacity by really allowing
*05:29.240- 05:35.160* :  for government support, the regulation of the rocket industry, of the defense manufacturing
*05:35.160- 05:42.300* :  industry, and the popping up of these local production and industrial hubs that allow for a
*05:42.300- 05:48.560* :  range of very different and technically specific drones some used for tactical battlefield use,
*05:48.560- 05:54.080* :  like the smaller first-person view quadcopter systems, all the way up to much longer systems
*05:54.080- 06:00.580* :  that have a range of anything up to 800 miles. So Ukraine has really diversified its defense
*06:00.580- 06:04.800* :  industry and as a result of that can present quite a lot of powerful systems on the battlefield.
*06:05.080- 06:10.780* :  What does it mean for the direction of the conflict? Because now Ukraine is taking Russian
*06:10.780- 06:17.980* :  territory, but it also has this massive front line at home. So how can it deploy this technology
*06:17.980- 06:24.400* :  to try and take on Russia? Well, it's exactly because it can deploy this technology that it can
*06:24.400- 06:30.200* :  take on Russia, or at least it's trying desperately to defend itself, of course, against an offensive
*06:30.200- 06:36.540* :  Russia that started this invasion. What these drones allow is to strike deep behind enemy lines.
*06:36.540- 06:41.800* :  What Russia has been doing over recent months and weeks is pushing its supplies further and
*06:41.800- 06:46.260* :  further back and making sure that it's attack aircraft off further back from the front line. That
*06:46.260- 06:53.620* :  is in reaction to the effectiveness of Ukrainian drone systems. And so as Ukraine increases the
*06:53.620- 06:58.960* :  amount of drones that can fire and also the range of those drones, then it means that any of the Russian
*06:58.960- 07:03.520* :  aircraft that are attacking Ukraine itself, well, they become less effective. They have to be
*07:03.520- 07:08.520* :  further back. They have to fly further for their sources and they become increasingly vulnerable
*07:08.520- 07:13.520* :  to these drone attacks that are coming in. Now, alongside that, of course, the Ukrainians are also
*07:13.520- 07:20.200* :  bombing ammunition sites, industrial sites, and the oil and gas making facilities of the Russian
*07:20.200- 07:27.080* :  state. All of this is in a desperate attempt to try and blunt the war-making industry of Russia to
*07:27.080- 07:34.020* :  make it too damaging to continue this war. James Patton Rodgers. It wasn't drones, but missiles,
*07:34.020- 07:37.180* :  which seemed to have been at the center of a treason trial in Russia,
*07:37.700- 07:43.840* :  occurred in Moscow's sentence to prominent scientists to 15 years in jail. It's been reported. He was
*07:43.840- 07:49.520* :  accused of handing over secrets connected with Russia's hypersonic missile program. Alexander
*07:49.520- 07:54.040* :  Shipplyuk was the director of an institute that's part of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
*07:54.520- 07:57.720* :  Russia's state news agency TAS said he specialized in
*07:57.960- 08:02.220* :  Aerophysical Research, more details from Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.
*08:02.660- 08:08.600* :  Alexander Shipplyuk was sentenced to 15 years in a high-security penal colony. He's one of a
*08:08.600- 08:14.640* :  dozen Russian physicists arrested since 2015, who have some connection to the development of
*08:14.640- 08:21.140* :  hypersonic technology or to institutions that work on it. All have been charged with treason.
*08:22.100- 08:27.200* :  Because the trial was held behind closed doors, the details of the case haven't been made public.
*08:27.940- 08:33.400* :  Steve Rosenberg. Mongolia finds itself in a rather tricky diplomatic situation.
*08:33.400- 08:38.300* :  It's currently playing host of Vladimir Putin, Mongolia, and Russia are rolled allies.
*08:38.800- 08:43.960* :  The visits to mark the anniversary of a key battle they fought together against Japan in 1939.
*08:45.080- 08:50.180* :  But there is an arrest warrant out for President Putin issued by the International Criminal Court,
*08:50.180- 08:57.100* :  the ICC. The Mongolia is an ICC signatory. Still, Mr. Putin was welcomed at the airport by an
*08:57.100- 09:07.880* :  honor guard and full military fanfare. The visit is about more than pomp and mutual gratitude.
*09:07.880- 09:12.620* :  Russia's President Vladimir Putin has said the two countries have the potential for gas and
*09:12.620- 09:18.360* :  other energy cooperation deals. And as far as these two Mongolians were concerned, the international
*09:18.360- 09:26.200* :  criminal court's warrant should be ignored. The ICC is an international organization.
*09:26.920- 09:31.260* :  It's true that we are a member country, but it doesn't mean we have to follow every order.
*09:31.900- 09:37.600* :  And arresting Putin during this visit would be immoral and improper. China and Russia are both
*09:37.600- 09:44.440* :  very important to us as neighbors. We Mongolians do not support the arrest of Putin.
*09:44.440- 09:47.080* :  I don't support it because it's bad, man.
*09:49.580- 09:52.880* :  Russia appears confident there will be no arrest of its President,
*09:52.880- 09:58.860* :  Kremlin spokesman last week said they had no concerns. And it seems that confidence is well
*09:58.860- 10:03.300* :  founded. As our Asia-Pacific regional editor, Celia Hattin explains.
*10:04.020- 10:09.240* :  Mongolia says it's politically neutral, like Switzerland, and in recent years it's portrayed
*10:09.240- 10:15.280* :  itself as an unbiased third party on the global stage. Its host did high-profile diplomatic
*10:15.280- 10:20.300* :  gatherings to flesh out difficult topics from climate change to regional security.
*10:21.120- 10:26.400* :  But that doesn't change the fact that Mongolia is a landlocked country, sandwiched between two
*10:26.400- 10:33.560* :  comparatively rich, powerful nations, Russia and China. Mongolia is a huge country. It takes
*10:33.560- 10:39.980* :  a half the size of Europe, but it has a relatively small population, 3.3 million people.
*10:40.500- 10:44.320* :  It's almost completely dependent on trade with its two giant neighbors.
*10:44.540- 10:51.180* :  In the face of this, the Mongolian government started a third-naber strategy by forging close ties
*10:51.180- 10:57.020* :  with countries other than China and Russia, like the United States. A series of western leaders
*10:57.020- 11:03.500* :  have recently walked the red carpet in Ulan Bator. So, Mr. Putin's arrival has placed the
*11:03.500- 11:09.160* :  country in a difficult position, testing its neutrality. The Kremlin says the country's leaders
*11:09.160- 11:13.960* :  will discuss the building of a natural gas pipeline that would go through Mongolia,
*11:14.520- 11:21.040* :  carrying resources to China. Since Ulan Bator is dependent on Russia for fuel and energy,
*11:21.040- 11:27.820* :  such a pipeline would also be very valuable. Mongolia's economy has been hard hit by climate
*11:27.820- 11:32.760* :  change, killing off scores of livestock and forcing it to look for other ways to survive.
*11:33.640- 11:39.460* :  Ulan Bator could be trading one headache for another. If officials failed to arrest Vladimir
*11:39.460- 11:44.480* :  Putin, the country could face prosecution by the International Criminal Court and serious
*11:44.480- 11:51.540* :  criticism from its third-nabors. But presumably, after eyeing a powerful Russia to its north and
*11:51.540- 11:57.280* :  a pro-Russia China to the south, that's a risk the Mongolians have decided to take.
*12:14.140- 12:20.860* :  New, but the settler movement dates back far longer, as draw ed kes and Israeli expert on settlement
*12:20.860- 12:26.680* :  activity explains. This is a phenomenon actually which goes back, we can see the beginning of it
*12:26.680- 12:33.280* :  in the early 1980s, but it started to pick up actually in the last decade, and especially since
*12:33.280- 12:39.940* :  2017 when Trump came into office. And these entities with the elbows are usually organized around
*12:39.940- 12:45.860* :  one family and one couple in their late 20s, 30s, and then bunch of youngsters. Teenagers very
*12:45.860- 12:55.720* :  often people who are not using regularly schools who are channeled by the welfare parties to work
*12:55.720- 13:03.360* :  volunteer in these elbows and these entities. The idea behind it is to establish an elbows to
*13:03.360- 13:11.000* :  usually very remodeled from any other Israeli salmon or or existing elbows. In the middle of an
*13:11.000- 13:16.760* :  agriculture, Palestinian agricultural and herding area, in order to use the herd, which are
*13:16.760- 13:22.880* :  sometimes about sheep goat, sometimes about cattle, in order to use these herds to deport
*13:22.880- 13:31.860* :  deliberately Palestinians from agricultural and herding areas, these elbows have changed completely
*13:32.220- 13:39.220* :  large tracks of the West Bank. I'm talking about 100,000 of Dunams, which have become inaccessible
*13:39.220- 13:45.440* :  or very, very dangerous for Palestinian because of these elbows. We're talking about Mafia. We're talking
*13:45.440- 13:51.560* :  about Mafia. These elbows, settlers who are running these elbows, they're part of a larger system,
*13:51.560- 13:58.100* :  which is completely backed by all state organs I'm talking about, maybe Israeli police, I'm talking
*13:58.100- 14:02.860* :  about the Israeli military. I'm talking about different Israeli ministries who are financing
*14:02.860- 14:12.080* :  these elbows and these, this Palestinian family who is in danger to lose their land has no chance,
*14:12.080- 14:17.280* :  absolutely no chance against these people. We're not talking about lack of enforcement. We're
*14:17.280- 14:23.740* :  talking about actual violation of the law, also the Israeli law, not only international law,
*14:24.060- 14:30.860* :  which has a very, very clear purpose to depopulate larger tracks of the West Bank and to transfer
*14:30.860- 14:37.980* :  these lands to Israelis, settlers who are moving into this area. This is a system which several
*14:37.980- 14:46.620* :  Israeli public and governmental organs are very, very intensively involved with by financing and
*14:46.620- 14:53.360* :  by backing nothing could work without the Israeli state decision to carry out this campaign.
*14:57.400- 15:04.500* :  Still to come? I love the Sikh warriors and like they would represent what Sikhs would wear,
*15:05.060- 15:09.420* :  let's say, if they went into battle. We tell you all about the Sikh superheroes.
*15:17.360- 15:20.780* :  It's summer in Britain and the crimes are just getting started.

*15:47.300- 15:51.540* :  I'm Sumi Somaskanda from the Global Story podcast where we're looking at the problems facing
*15:51.540- 15:57.720* :  Boeing after failures of its Starliner spacecraft have left two astronauts stranded in space.
*15:58.460- 16:03.080* :  They were supposed to be on the International Space Station for eight days, but will now be
*16:03.080- 16:08.700* :  there for at least eight months. This is the latest in a long line of crises facing the company.
*16:09.440- 16:14.620* :  So is this one failure too far for Boeing? Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
*16:21.340- 16:26.800* :  It's one of the biggest corporate scandals of modern times. The German giant Volkswagen was found
*16:26.800- 16:32.480* :  to have cheated laboratory tests to make their cars appear more eco-friendly. It's already
*16:32.480- 16:38.600* :  cost Volkswagen more than 30 billion dollars in fines, compensation and legal fees, but Tuesday
*16:38.600- 16:44.260* :  sees the company's former head go on trial for his role in the affair. Martin, Winter Corn faces
*16:44.260- 16:49.320* :  up to ten years in prison if convicted. But then as our international business correspondent,
*16:49.320- 16:54.660* :  Theo Leggett told me, the effects of this affair were widespread and long-lasting.
*16:55.440- 17:01.480* :  It was a huge scandal. This was a scandal that rocked the entire car industry and rocked the
*17:01.480- 17:06.380* :  German corporate establishment as well. This was Volkswagen. The Volkswagen Empire, which doesn't
*17:06.380- 17:12.540* :  just include Volkswagen cars, it's Audi, it's Porsche, it's Saar, it's Škoda, one of the jewels in
*17:12.540- 17:19.260* :  the crown of German industry. And what happened was in 2015, the U.S. environmental authorities
*17:19.260- 17:27.260* :  accused Volkswagen of deliberately fitting software in its cars that enabled them to get through
*17:27.340- 17:32.700* :  emissions testing by artificial means. And Volkswagen eventually did own up to this.
*17:33.120- 17:37.860* :  And what had been happening was Volkswagen was on a sales drive in the United States. It wanted
*17:37.860- 17:43.200* :  to sell more cars there and it wanted to sell diesel cars there. And it did a marketing campaign
*17:43.200- 17:48.960* :  based on clean diesels. The problem was its engines weren't that clean. And in order to meet U.S.
*17:48.960- 17:55.420* :  emissions standards, which were very stringent, it either would end up with cars that didn't
*17:55.420- 18:00.920* :  perform very well or weren't very reliable, or it fitted software. So that's what happened
*18:00.920- 18:06.220* :  with Volkswagen. But Martin Vinterkorn's facing a criminal trial, what exactly are the offences
*18:06.220- 18:11.180* :  that he's alleged to have committed? First of all, fraud that people who bought cars that were
*18:11.180- 18:15.920* :  fitted with the so-called defeat devices that turned emission controls off in the lab, on in
*18:15.920- 18:19.280* :  the lab and then off when they were on the road didn't know what they were buying and suffered
*18:19.280- 18:25.180* :  financial losses as a result. Market manipulation, because Volkswagen wasn't transparent
*18:25.180- 18:30.280* :  with Volkswagen investors about what they were doing and the share price fell in the wake of all
*18:30.280- 18:35.100* :  this. And also poetry. He's accused of giving forced testimony to a German parliamentary committee
*18:35.440- 18:39.300* :  which was investigating the scandal. Now, he would have gone on trial years ago, but he's been
*18:39.300- 18:43.640* :  suffering from poor health, which is why it's only now nine years after the scandal erupted,
*18:43.640- 18:47.560* :  that we're seeing him take the stand. You mentioned there that the share price fell, but
*18:47.880- 18:53.720* :  briefly Martin, in the sort of longer term, was Volkswagen affected, their sales and their
*18:53.720- 18:59.440* :  financial position? They were affected very significantly. There was first of all that £30
*18:59.440- 19:06.760* :  billion loss, which is part of its history now, but also the entire strategy of the company had
*19:06.760- 19:12.280* :  to be overhauled. In the wake of all of this, Volkswagen moved away from producing diesel cars,
*19:12.280- 19:18.660* :  they were unmarketable for a while, and it focused instead on electric cars. And German politicians
*19:18.660- 19:23.980* :  sort of followed suit and decided to launch their own campaigns against diesel cars in particular,
*19:23.980- 19:30.420* :  but also against petrol cars. So this is why nowadays we have these looming dates when European
*19:30.420- 19:35.540* :  governments will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, 2030 in the United Kingdom, for example,
*19:36.020- 19:39.760* :  and everybody's going to have to move electric. That was a move that probably would have happened
*19:39.760- 19:44.920* :  at some point, but it was accelerated to a great degree by the Volkswagen scandal.
*19:45.460- 19:50.880* :  Theo-legged. Makala Prison may be the largest in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*19:51.500- 19:56.400* :  but there were only ever supposed to be 1,500 people incarcerated there. At the last count,
*19:56.400- 20:02.420* :  however, there were 12,000 eight times more than its capacity. So it's safe to say these are
*20:02.420- 20:07.760* :  challenging conditions at the best of times, and when inmates apparently attempted a mass breakout,
*20:07.760- 20:13.940* :  the result was widespread death and injury. The DRC's interior minister, Jackamaine Shabani-Luku,
*20:14.600- 20:18.860* :  posted a video statement on social media outlining the extent of the casualties.
*20:23.220- 20:29.540* :  The provisional human death toll stands at 129, including 24 from gunshot wounds.
*20:29.540- 20:34.300* :  The others died in a stampede, from suffocation, and some women were raped.
*20:34.300- 20:39.800* :  59 people were also injured. The government is pleased that calm has been restored,
*20:39.800- 20:45.680* :  but condemns these unfortunate incidents and offers its deepest condolences to the families
*20:45.680- 20:51.080* :  and loved ones of the victims. An investigation is underway to identify and prosecute those
*20:51.720- 20:56.420* :  responsible. Africa Regional Editor, Richard Kugoy, told us what we know so far.
*20:57.100- 21:03.600* :  On Monday at around 2am in the morning, some inmates set on fire, the administration block,
*21:03.600- 21:09.440* :  and a couple of other buildings in this facility. So in the process, some of the inmates
*21:09.440- 21:15.600* :  out of panic attempted to find their way out and just to run away from the fire. So a stampede
*21:15.600- 21:22.900* :  occurred, and in the process almost 129 people died. And yet we also heard the interior minister
*21:22.900- 21:28.720* :  there talking about women being raped. Do we have any idea how that managed to happen in the
*21:28.720- 21:34.300* :  middle of the kind of chaos you're describing? Because this is a very overcrowded facility,
*21:34.300- 21:40.120* :  and so there have been challenges in terms of investment. And so it's become very difficult,
*21:40.120- 21:45.660* :  because in the course of the chaos, then you'd have the male and female inmates interacting.
*21:45.660- 21:51.800* :  The prison officers must have been overwhelmed by this incident. But this was a breakout that has
*21:51.800- 21:57.340* :  never been witnessed before, because we had a similar incident in 2017, but the scale of this
*21:57.420- 22:05.140* :  is huge. Richard Cugoy. Pope Francis is nothing if not ambitious. At the age of 87,
*22:05.180- 22:10.520* :  he's just arrived in Indonesia where he aims to promote peace between Christians and Muslims,
*22:10.520- 22:16.120* :  and try to persuade people to take climate change more seriously, and unless anyone should doubt
*22:16.120- 22:22.420* :  his get up and go, the Pope will continue by visiting East Timor, Singapore, and Papu New Guinea
*22:22.420- 22:28.780* :  at 12-day tour in total. There has been some concession to the pontiff's relatively advanced age,
*22:28.780- 22:34.080* :  we're told he'll rest for a day after what's been a 13-hour flight to reach the Indonesian capital.
*22:34.680- 22:39.320* :  But then he'll have a series of meetings and a public appearance. Whereas our Southeast Asia
*22:39.320- 22:44.360* :  correspondent Jonathan Head explained, he's expected to talk about Indonesia's different religions
*22:44.360- 22:49.260* :  and religious groupings. It's got the world's largest Muslim population, Islam is not the official
*22:49.740- 22:55.420* :  religion. Many faiths are tolerated and do coexist. There have been examples of violence,
*22:55.460- 23:00.980* :  particularly with the rise of Islamic extremism that we saw particularly about 20 years ago,
*23:00.980- 23:06.200* :  and Christian communities have been targeted. I think the bigger issue that is raised, particularly
*23:06.200- 23:13.380* :  by human rights groups, is a general reduction of tolerance of religious practices and use of
*23:13.380- 23:18.000* :  things like the blasphemy law. It's been used in quite a number of high profile cases against people
*23:18.000- 23:24.460* :  perceived to have insulted Islam, the intolerance of other factions of Islam as well, other splinter
*23:24.820- 23:29.380* :  groups. Generally, I don't think that the Pope is going to highlight those. He's going to highlight
*23:29.380- 23:35.440* :  the positives, which is that in his view, Indonesia is still a great example of multi-religious
*23:35.440- 23:39.860* :  cooperation and cohabitation, given that in many parts of the world there's much less of that.
*23:40.400- 23:44.980* :  Indonesia is also, from his point of view, a kind of model, non-aligned country, a country that
*23:44.980- 23:49.920* :  opens itself up diplomatically to all sides. It's a big and important global player,
*23:50.440- 23:55.900* :  and the Vatican has for many, many years, going back decades, made a particular point of working
*23:55.900- 24:01.660* :  on its relationships with successive Indonesian governments, a secular state, remember, to enhance
*24:01.660- 24:07.160* :  the protection and the status of the relatively small Catholic population. It's only about 3% of
*24:07.160- 24:11.640* :  the population. And briefly, Jonathan, I mean, climate change, it is you in all the countries
*24:11.640- 24:16.960* :  of the Pope's visiting, what's his message, and who's his audience? His audience, he hopes,
*24:16.960- 24:23.360* :  will be the entire population, and Indonesia is, for us, its majority Islam, religion has taken
*24:23.360- 24:29.340* :  very seriously. He's a high status visitor from another faith. I think, of course, the Roman Catholic
*24:29.340- 24:34.080* :  population, which is distributed very widely in Indonesia, and many people will have to travel a
*24:34.080- 24:38.720* :  long way to have a chance to see him in the capital Chikato, which is the anyplace in Indonesia he's
*24:38.720- 24:44.100* :  going. For them, it's obviously enormous significance. It's 35 years since the last visit by a
*24:44.100- 24:48.940* :  Pope to Indonesia, so people have been waiting a long time to have the chance for many coming
*24:48.940- 24:54.020* :  into Chikato tomorrow to celebrate mass with him in a stadium, and that's very, very special for them.
*24:54.680- 24:59.280* :  Jonathan Head, we were speaking there about climate change, the effects of global warming
*24:59.280- 25:04.760* :  are many and varied. And a new report serves to emphasize just how many different areas of life
*25:04.760- 25:09.940* :  can be altered. Bangladesh is currently recovering from recent flooding, which displays more than
*25:09.940- 25:14.680* :  five million people a problem, which scientists say can only get worse as temperatures rise.
*25:15.440- 25:21.380* :  At the charity's UNICEF and save the children, say this could harm efforts to reduce child
*25:21.380- 25:25.160* :  marriage. So what's the connection? Greer Jackson explains.
*25:29.100- 25:32.700* :  The heavy rains in Bangladesh have shattered many lives.
*25:35.800- 25:41.740* :  Here, a man is carrying chickens on his head in a cage, protecting them as brown,
*25:41.740- 25:51.000* :  ankle deep water rushes all around him. It was a flood just like this one that led a girl who
*25:51.000- 25:57.740* :  will call a liar to be married off. Her family lost everything and had to leave their home.
*25:59.180- 26:04.880* :  I was so young just 16 years old then. I did not want to get married, but I was married anyway.
*26:05.960- 26:10.840* :  If I could have stayed in school, I could have been someone. I could have joined the army,
*26:11.240- 26:13.820* :  but I have not been able to change anything in my life.
*26:14.700- 26:19.780* :  Underpinning child marriage is poverty, insecurity and gender inequality,
*26:20.640- 26:26.900* :  but increasingly climate change is playing a role. It's making extreme weather like
*26:26.900- 26:35.160* :  heavy monsoons and heatwaves much more common. And that is increasing the risk factors for girls
*26:35.160- 26:41.900* :  being married before they're 18 years old. That's according to Gabrielle Zabo from the charity
*26:41.900- 26:48.640* :  Save the Children. So I think if we imagine a family that's experienced a climate disaster,
*26:49.460- 26:54.480* :  there's often huge financial pressure that comes with losing the crop or even being forced
*26:54.880- 27:00.320* :  to migrate because you can no longer earn an income in the area you once lived. That family
*27:00.320- 27:04.460* :  is then forced to make some of those tricky decisions about whether they'd be better able to provide
*27:04.460- 27:09.620* :  for their daughters if they were to marry them to another family. What does the day to say
*27:09.620- 27:15.440* :  on that increased risk? There was a study done in Bangladesh a few years ago that showed very
*27:15.440- 27:21.260* :  young adolescent girls. So those who were much less likely to be child brides were actually
*27:21.260- 27:27.680* :  twice as likely to marry in the year that followed an extreme heat wave. Gabrielle fears that
*27:27.680- 27:34.620* :  not only could more girls be at risk because of climate change, but also they may be forced to
*27:34.620- 27:41.520* :  marry even younger. Yes, so this is one of the I guess really concerning aspects of crisis
*27:42.540- 27:48.060* :  is that the more desperate families become the lower those ages tend to go.
*27:52.060- 27:58.280* :  But in Bangladesh, community hubs like the one where Shabnaza Harin works are fighting back.
*27:58.760- 28:04.160* :  We can prevent child marriage by making the community aware of the issue with campaigns on the
*28:04.160- 28:10.560* :  TV, radio and the internet. And we can put on events in the community where we talk about child
*28:10.560- 28:17.240* :  marriage and its negative consequences. Thanks to initiatives like this, Bangladesh has managed
*28:17.240- 28:27.180* :  to reduce the number of child brides 10 years ago 65% of girls got married early. Now it's 56%.
*28:28.140- 28:33.720* :  But now climate change could diminish that progress. Warns Gabrielle from Save the Children.
*28:34.360- 28:38.480* :  The extra heartbreaking piece I think around Bangladesh is actually a country that have been
*28:38.480- 28:46.200* :  making huge progress to reduce rates of child marriage. And now this increasing climate
*28:46.200- 28:51.260* :  disasters are creating real barriers that are slowing down progress and perhaps threatening to
*28:51.260- 28:58.060* :  push back progress. That report from Greia Jackson. It's long been a complaint about superhero
*28:58.060- 29:02.740* :  heroes that while they may have had very different superpowers, they were all to a man and woman
*29:02.740- 29:08.140* :  white. Now that has changed in recent years most notably, there was the Oscar-winning film Black
*29:08.140- 29:13.680* :  Panther. But there have also been Middle Eastern and Asian superheroes and super heroines.
*29:14.120- 29:19.340* :  Now the Kalsa Toy Store in the English City of Leicester has created action figures that look
*29:19.340- 29:25.520* :  like Sikhs and they're spreading around the world. As BBC Asian networks Raj Khor Bilku has
*29:25.520- 29:29.600* :  been finding out, the idea was born out of a chat between two friends.
*29:35.840- 29:40.520* :  Belinda's kids in Leicester are obsessed with their new toys. Tara is 10 years old.
*29:40.800- 29:48.040* :  I love that it's like the Sikh warriors and like they would represent what Sikhs would wear
*29:48.420- 29:52.420* :  like let's say if they went into battle. And Zoroah were is seven.
*29:56.520- 30:01.940* :  Kalsa Toy Store was created in 2021 by two friends from Coventry, making action figures based
*30:01.940- 30:10.420* :  on Sikh history and culture, the first of its kind in the world. I've come to the distribution
*30:10.420- 30:15.780* :  centre in Leicester's mountain roads to meet co-founder Suk Singh. So I was with my business partner,
*30:15.780- 30:21.940* :  we were at his house and he has two young boys and they said Dad, why don't we have any toys that
*30:21.940- 30:26.780* :  look like us and that's kind of like a light bulb moment where we thought actually yeah that's
*30:26.780- 30:31.520* :  true like why don't we have something that you know represents our image, our physical characteristics
*30:31.740- 30:38.400* :  because we have a very distinct and unique appearance. Where to spread far away is online and now the
*30:38.400- 30:48.720* :  companies getting orders from all corners of the world. We've got quite a global reach now so we've
*30:48.720- 30:54.540* :  had a lot of orders from Canada, a lot of orders from America and now we see an increase in
*30:54.540- 30:59.560* :  demand in Australia and India as well. Ordained seats have a very distinct appearance including
*30:59.560- 31:05.960* :  uncut hair, wearing a turban and a ceremonial dagger called a kibbarn. These are all featured in
*31:05.960- 31:11.320* :  the action figures. We wanted to create characters which are fiction based and the reason we did that
*31:11.320- 31:15.680* :  it just to keep you know the utmost respect in terms of how these tours will be used you know
*31:15.680- 31:19.380* :  which children might be thrown on the floor we can understand what some people would find that
*31:19.380- 31:24.340* :  like and hurt their sentiments. Action figures have been around for decades from Superman to Spider-Man
*31:24.600- 31:29.160* :  so why are these figurines such a big deal for the Sikh community? It's a very good question.
*31:29.380- 31:34.220* :  Sequinda Singh from Sri Guru Nanak Sahib Academy travels the world teaching about Sikh history.
*31:34.660- 31:40.520* :  Sikhs we are very small in numbers and wherever they we go we stand out because we are that
*31:40.520- 31:44.600* :  visible. It can be a problem when it comes to bullying or getting picked on because if you look
*31:44.600- 31:49.180* :  different then you're going to be a target. When they see these figurines it gives them that
*31:49.180- 31:54.420* :  confidence that they need to be able to go out there and be proud of who they are. As for Kalsa
*31:54.420- 31:59.300* :  Toi Sto what are the plans moving forward Sikh? We want to make animations which allow children
*31:59.300- 32:04.620* :  to watch them and take away a piece of education from that as well about Sikh history, about
*32:04.620- 32:09.680* :  Sikh culture, about heritage. That report from Raj Kaur Bilko.
*32:12.120- 32:16.180* :  And that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*32:16.840- 32:21.180* :  If you want to comment on the podcast or the topics covered in it you can send us an email.
*32:21.180- 32:29.160* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on x at Global News Pod.
*32:29.160- 32:34.740* :  This edition was mixed by Nora Hool. The producer was Rachel Wright. The editor is Karen Martin.
*32:35.260- 32:37.380* :  I'm Paul Moss until next time goodbye.
*33:05.260- 33:10.020* :  I can feel it. I'm going to crack the stream the best in British crime drama on Britbox.
*33:10.380- 33:14.000* :  You know this is why I want to be a detective. Watch with a free trial today.
*33:15.040- 33:19.280* :  I'm Sumi Somaskanda from the Global Story Podcast where we're looking at the problems facing
*33:19.280- 33:25.480* :  Boeing after failures of its Starliner spacecraft have left two astronauts stranded in space.
*33:26.240- 33:30.820* :  They were supposed to be on the International Space Station for eight days but will now be
*33:30.820- 33:36.440* :  there for at least eight months. This is the latest in a long line of crises facing the company.
*33:37.200- 33:42.360* :  So is this one failure too far for Boeing? Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
