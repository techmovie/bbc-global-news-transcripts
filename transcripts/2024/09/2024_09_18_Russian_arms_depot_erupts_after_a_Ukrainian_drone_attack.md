*01:31.400- 01:31.980* :  stories.
*01:32.400- 01:36.440* :  Ukraine appears to be behind a train attack on a Russian military base which has caused
*01:36.440- 01:38.580* :  explosions that can be seen from space.
*01:39.180- 01:44.480* :  Iran accuses Israel of mass murder for its targeted attack on thousands of members of
*01:44.480- 01:46.760* :  Hezbollah using exploding pages.

*01:52.600- 01:53.160* :  crisis.
*01:55.900- 01:58.820* :  Also in this podcast, the party is over.
*01:59.140- 01:59.460* :  Perhaps.
*01:59.900- 02:01.820* :  Have you ever been to a top-aware party on your own?
*02:01.960- 02:02.900* :  No, I'll say I have.
*02:03.240- 02:03.740* :  I'm a barn.
*02:03.820- 02:04.200* :  Have you?
*02:05.400- 02:06.180* :  No, I haven't lived.
*02:06.300- 02:07.100* :  Shall we throw one?
*02:07.100- 02:07.940* :  We should.
*02:07.940- 02:08.380* :  Yeah.
*02:08.920- 02:13.560* :  The brand top-aware is fighting to survive after a bankruptcy filing.
*02:17.300- 02:23.280* :  We start in Russia where a Ukrainian drone attack on an arsenal in Western Russia has caused
*02:23.280- 02:29.260* :  a fire and forced the partial evacuation of residents in the town of Toripets.
*02:29.560- 02:35.220* :  It targeted stores of missiles, ammunition and explosive sending flames and smoke high
*02:35.440- 02:36.320* :  into the night sky.
*02:36.340- 02:41.840* :  The governor of the Tava region, Igor Rodinia, said the fire had been caused by falling
*02:41.840- 02:42.240* :  debris.
*02:45.620- 02:52.480* :  The Russian Federation's air defense system was activated tonight due to an attack by
*02:52.480- 02:54.500* :  unmanned aerial devices.
*02:55.260- 02:59.100* :  The drones were shot down, but there was a fire when they fell.
*02:59.780- 03:06.180* :  We are currently working to maintain public order whilst also evacuating our people
*03:06.660- 03:08.300* :  and the residents who are there.
*03:08.820- 03:13.420* :  As Ukraine has ramped up its domestic drone production over the past two years, it has increased
*03:13.420- 03:15.540* :  attacks on Russian territory.
*03:15.540- 03:19.600* :  Ukraine's biggest ever-drenched, right, targeted Moscow earlier this month.
*03:19.900- 03:24.900* :  Just before we recorded this podcast, I heard more from our correspondent James Waterhouse
*03:25.260- 03:25.920* :  who's in Kiev.
*03:26.440- 03:29.800* :  Ukraine is building this as quite the coup, if you like.
*03:29.800- 03:36.140* :  We've heard from sources at the country's security service who say this was the
*03:36.140- 03:43.620* :  targeting of a sizable military site in a Russian town called Todapets, where tens
*03:43.620- 03:48.940* :  of millions of dollars has been spent over the past few years as Russia's military has
*03:49.260- 03:52.100* :  stored fuel tanks are stationed there.
*03:52.100- 03:57.760* :  They've stored a whole host of ammunition, artillery shells, ballistic missiles and other
*03:57.760- 04:04.320* :  explosives, all things which are used in Russia's continued invasion of Ukraine.
*04:04.460- 04:08.800* :  If you look at satellite imagery, it's a sizable complex.
*04:09.560- 04:16.160* :  Now if you couple that with the explosions we have seen in the subsequent videos where
*04:16.500- 04:22.940* :  you are seeing huge plumes of smoke followed by what are clearly shockwaves which go for
*04:22.940- 04:28.840* :  quite a distance, that is reflective, I think, of warehouses being full of ammunition.
*04:29.120- 04:31.400* :  Yeah, these explosions visible from space.
*04:31.860- 04:36.700* :  We heard of confirmation from NASA that they picked up several heat sources on satellite
*04:36.700- 04:39.820* :  imagery and even a minor earthquake was reported.
*04:40.460- 04:44.740* :  That will add to Ukrainian delight and it will be a much needed morale boost.
*04:45.360- 04:49.880* :  There's also a broader political picture here as well where at the moment the west is saying
*04:49.880- 04:56.620* :  Ukraine can't use the missiles they provide on targets inside Russia, so we're seeing
*04:56.620- 05:01.060* :  Ukraine say, okay, well if you're not going to let us, we'll do it ourselves with drones
*05:01.060- 05:03.260* :  that we continue to manufacture domestically.
*05:03.420- 05:08.960* :  How much of the weaponry and ammunition that Russia is using in Ukraine would have been
*05:08.960- 05:10.320* :  stored at this place?
*05:10.820- 05:11.920* :  Very hard to quantify.
*05:12.340- 05:15.000* :  Clearly, this was a major hub.
*05:15.160- 05:20.080* :  If you look at our Russia fires artillery on Ukrainian territory.
*05:20.080- 05:24.940* :  If you look at our Russia, mounts missile attacks right across the front line.
*05:25.480- 05:30.380* :  It sustains these kind of strikes on a daily basis.
*05:30.920- 05:36.500* :  Now, in terms of missile stockpiles, it's thought Russia has around a thousand and give
*05:36.500- 05:39.180* :  all tail, it'll never let it drop to a significant level.
*05:39.520- 05:44.460* :  Its economy is on a war footing and typically it likes to build that stock pile up before
*05:44.460- 05:47.620* :  unleashing nationwide air attacks inside Ukraine.
*05:47.620- 05:51.680* :  So this will certainly frustrate the Russians in that endeavor.
*05:52.060- 05:57.040* :  It'll also crucially frustrate Russia's operations closer to the front line.
*05:57.040- 06:02.300* :  But to what extent is not yet clear, because we have to remind ourselves that things are
*06:02.300- 06:07.420* :  not going Ukraine's way on the battlefields still, they haven't for some time, but certainly
*06:07.420- 06:10.860* :  this sends a message both militarily and politically.
*06:11.900- 06:18.520* :  James Waterhouse in Kiev Iran has accused Israel of mass murder after thousands of
*06:18.520- 06:23.620* :  handheld pages exploded in a coordinated attack that resembled something out of a
*06:23.660- 06:24.180* :  spytherin.
*06:24.180- 06:29.900* :  The Lebanese government says 12 people were killed and nearly 3,000 injured, including
*06:29.900- 06:31.260* :  the Iranian ambassador.
*06:31.760- 06:37.360* :  Among those treating the victims is Dr. Elias Warak, an ophthalmologist at Mount Lebanon
*06:37.360- 06:38.660* :  University Hospital.
*06:39.260- 06:45.080* :  The least I can say it has been a nightmare, probably this is the worst day of my life as
*06:45.080- 06:45.580* :  a physician.
*06:46.320- 06:53.780* :  I believe the number of casualties and the type of damage that has been done is humongous.
*06:54.360- 06:57.040* :  Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes.
*06:57.260- 07:04.080* :  I can tell you that probably more than 60 to 70% of the patients ended up with the eviscerating
*07:04.080- 07:06.540* :  or removing at least one of their eyes.
*07:06.840- 07:10.820* :  And we're talking about young population, about patients in their 20s.
*07:11.120- 07:14.140* :  And unfortunately, the damage is not limited only to the eyes.
*07:14.140- 07:19.480* :  Some of them, they had intracranial damage, a damage in their brain, in addition to any
*07:20.200- 07:23.780* :  facial damage, whether to the nose, to the mouth, to the ears.
*07:24.400- 07:28.460* :  Unfortunately, most of them, they lost at least one of their hands.
*07:28.940- 07:33.800* :  There's been widespread condemnation in the Middle East and Hezbollah itself is vowed
*07:33.800- 07:34.580* :  to retaliate.
*07:34.940- 07:36.620* :  Israel has made no public comment.
*07:36.620- 07:41.300* :  The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is visiting Egypt, denied that Washington
*07:41.300- 07:43.640* :  had any prior knowledge of the attack.
*07:44.120- 07:45.980* :  He spoke at a news conference in Kare.
*07:46.520- 07:51.340* :  The United States did not know about nor was it involved in these incidents, and we're
*07:51.340- 07:53.840* :  still gathering the information and gathering the facts.
*07:54.400- 07:59.600* :  Broadly speaking, we've been very clear and we remain very clear about the importance
*07:59.600- 08:05.680* :  of all parties avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict that we're
*08:05.680- 08:09.280* :  trying to resolve in Gaza to see it spread to other fronts.
*08:09.760- 08:12.540* :  It's clearly not in the interest of anyone involved to see that happen.
*08:12.960- 08:16.360* :  So what do we know about the Pager attack and how it happened?
*08:16.780- 08:21.600* :  Just before we recorded this podcast, I asked our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bashegger,
*08:21.820- 08:23.760* :  who's in the Lebanese capital buried.
*08:24.360- 08:31.420* :  The reports today suggest that these pages, there were explosives in those pages and that
*08:31.460- 08:34.760* :  they were detonated remotely at the same time.
*08:35.140- 08:40.800* :  After all these pages received a message that people believed had come from Hezbollah because
*08:40.800- 08:46.640* :  these pages had been distributed by Hezbollah precisely because of security concerns,
*08:47.020- 08:53.940* :  concerns that the Israeli military, the Israeli intelligence agencies could have reached Hezbollah's
*08:54.100- 08:55.400* :  telecommunication system.
*08:55.480- 09:01.080* :  So these pages had been distributed thousands of them to fighters, to members of the group,
*09:01.760- 09:02.660* :  to protect them.
*09:02.880- 09:09.080* :  And instead what happened yesterday was that those pages were used in this unprecedented
*09:09.080- 09:14.900* :  attack here in terms of the scale of this attack, a massive security breach for Hezbollah.
*09:15.300- 09:20.880* :  And an attack that has not only shocked Lebanon but has caused a lot of anger here because
*09:21.240- 09:27.140* :  these pages exploded as people were in shops, were with their families at home.
*09:27.540- 09:34.640* :  Reports here in Lebanon suggest that one of the victims, a girl aged eight, she died when
*09:34.640- 09:39.140* :  she went to pick up the page of her dad after the message was received.
*09:39.220- 09:42.780* :  So there is a lot of anger here in Lebanon following this attack.
*09:43.220- 09:47.820* :  Little doubt that Israel and probably the Mossad were behind this.
*09:48.180- 09:51.180* :  Exactly and we haven't heard any reaction from the Israelis.
*09:51.340- 09:56.740* :  This is the natural position every time these attacks happen.
*09:56.860- 10:02.920* :  But Hezbollah and Lebanon have blamed Israel for the attack and Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate.
*10:02.920- 10:07.940* :  And tomorrow we are expecting to hear from the powerful head of Hezbollah, Hassan Asrallah,
*10:07.940- 10:13.280* :  who is going to give a speech, reacting to what happened here in Lebanon yesterday.
*10:13.860- 10:17.980* :  And again for almost a year people here in Lebanon have been fearing that Hezbollah has
*10:17.980- 10:24.160* :  been dragging this country into another conflict with Israel with these near daily cross-border
*10:24.160- 10:24.720* :  attacks.
*10:25.000- 10:30.640* :  The Israelis are now saying that the return of tens of thousands of residents would be displaced
*10:30.640- 10:34.640* :  because of the violence in other news row is one of the goals of the war.
*10:35.160- 10:39.640* :  And I think here today those fears are again on the rise.
*10:40.180- 10:41.960* :  Here you go, Bishaga in Beirut.
*10:42.660- 10:47.900* :  For the first time in a decade voters are going to the polls in a state election in Jammu
*10:47.900- 10:48.580* :  and Kashmir.
*10:48.940- 10:54.760* :  The region is claimed by both India and Pakistan and has been the cause of three wars between
*10:54.760- 11:00.540* :  the rival nuclear armed neighbours, thousands have died since the start of a decade-long
*11:00.540- 11:02.900* :  armed insurgency against Indian rule.
*11:02.940- 11:09.380* :  The BBC's Rias Masruh, who's in the Kashmiri capital Sinragar, spoke earlier to my colleague
*11:09.380- 11:10.920* :  Victoria Uwankunda.
*11:11.400- 11:15.600* :  The last election happened in 2014 and this is for the first time that people are coming
*11:15.600- 11:16.320* :  out to vote.
*11:16.420- 11:22.100* :  But a lot has happened in this past decade because a ceasefire is holding between India and
*11:22.100- 11:27.480* :  Pakistan and the level of violence has gone tremendously low in Kashmir valley, although
*11:27.480- 11:31.940* :  it's escalating in parts of Jammu, which is in the Himalayan range of Peer Punjab.
*11:32.460- 11:38.320* :  This is for the first time that I am right now in the hometown of a much celebrated militant
*11:38.320- 11:43.300* :  commander, Burhan Mani, who was the poster boy of local insurgency in 2016.
*11:43.980- 11:48.800* :  Back then when we came here to cover elections after his killing in an encounter, there were
*11:48.800- 11:53.120* :  people who would refuse to come out of their homes and polling booths over a deserted
*11:53.340- 11:53.440* :  look.
*11:54.040- 11:58.780* :  But right now, as I am in his hometown, people are coming out in throes and they are queuing
*11:58.780- 12:00.220* :  up outside polling stations.
*12:00.840- 12:05.540* :  So there's a lot of enthusiasm about the voting in these parts where the first phase is
*12:05.540- 12:05.880* :  happening.
*12:06.140- 12:11.940* :  Bring us, our listeners, to update of why this area is so controversial and important
*12:11.940- 12:15.540* :  to both India and Pakistan and other, they've been fighting over it for years.
*12:15.540- 12:21.300* :  As you said, Kashmir is disputed since 1947 between two nuclear parts, but as far as
*12:21.360- 12:25.200* :  elections are concerned, they have been a contentious issue between both the countries.
*12:25.340- 12:30.740* :  Because Pakistan claims that elections cannot be an authentic expression of political aspirations
*12:30.740- 12:34.300* :  as mandated by the United Nations, you know, resolution.
*12:34.820- 12:39.160* :  And India claims that people are coming out to vote, that means they are authenticating
*12:39.160- 12:40.580* :  India's claim on Kashmir.
*12:40.580- 12:45.820* :  So this claim and counterclaim has made these elections contentious between the two countries.
*12:46.040- 12:50.480* :  Give us a sense, then, of who are the main contenders in this election and the parties
*12:50.980- 12:52.340* :  who are vying for a seat.
*12:52.540- 12:57.860* :  You see, BJP for past 10 years has been, you know, telling its supporters and people in
*12:57.860- 13:03.300* :  Hindu majority Jammu that this will be for the first time since 1947 that a Hindu
*13:03.300- 13:06.420* :  Chief Minister will be elected and BJP will form the government.
*13:06.420- 13:11.260* :  But it could not get many candidates in Kashmir value, although it is building candidates
*13:11.260- 13:15.460* :  on all 43 seats in Jammu region, which is Hindu majority region.
*13:15.860- 13:21.700* :  But a dramatic turn of events came up when former lawmaker, engineer Rashid, was released
*13:21.700- 13:27.540* :  two months back and now he is out on limited time bail and he campaigned across Kashmir.
*13:27.540- 13:32.800* :  He has fielded his candidates on many seats and his political slogan is the resolution
*13:32.800- 13:36.080* :  of Kashmir issue, play-based seat, release of prisoners.
*13:36.080- 13:41.100* :  So this has given a kind of breather to voters to utilize this political space to express
*13:41.100- 13:42.940* :  their anger against whatever has happened.
*13:43.480- 13:48.520* :  Rias Masroo, elections are also being held in Sri Lanka this weekend.
*13:48.660- 13:54.300* :  For decades, politics in Sri Lanka has been dominated by one family, the Raja Paxas.
*13:54.820- 14:00.120* :  But their reputation was ruined after the country's economic collapse in 2022, a result
*14:00.120- 14:04.700* :  of decades of financial mismanagement by the governments in which they played leading
*14:04.700- 14:05.140* :  parts.
*14:05.460- 14:10.200* :  In Saturday's presidential elections, people are hopeful that this could be the beginning
*14:10.200- 14:15.860* :  of a new era, the BBC's South Asia correspondent Samira Hussein reports from Sri Lanka.
*14:18.980- 14:22.880* :  The Raja Paxas have dominated Sri Lankan politics for decades.
*14:23.680- 14:28.800* :  Namal Raja Paxa is the latest from the political dynasty to enter the presidential race.
*14:29.420- 14:34.740* :  His family has a long history in Sri Lanka, most notably for sinking the island nation
*14:35.000- 14:36.980* :  into a crushing economic crisis.
*14:38.480- 14:43.920* :  Most of the amounts of excitement as Namal Raja Paxa takes the stage at this political rally,
*14:44.480- 14:47.060* :  hundreds have come to listen to him speak.
*14:47.560- 14:53.440* :  Although the Raja Paxa name comes with a lot of political baggage, he believes that he
*14:53.440- 14:55.100* :  can overcome some of that legacy.
*14:56.240- 15:01.700* :  His father and his uncle, both forced out of office, but Namal Raja Paxa says he can
*15:01.700- 15:02.500* :  be somebody new.
*15:02.780- 15:06.740* :  The Raja Paxas are blamed for Sri Lankan's economic growth.
*15:07.120- 15:08.540* :  Why do you think you should run?
*15:09.360- 15:11.000* :  Well, see, it's up to the people who deserve it.
*15:11.040- 15:12.200* :  We have been known exactly.
*15:13.180- 15:18.000* :  We know we haven't done anything wrong to the people of this country, so we are willing
*15:18.000- 15:19.440* :  to face the people and the public.
*15:19.440- 15:21.700* :  So, let the public decide as to what they want to vote for.
*15:25.800- 15:31.860* :  Two years ago, there was a massive uprising against severe food shortages and skyrocketing
*15:31.860- 15:38.260* :  inflation, a result of decades of financial mismanagement by the Raja Paxas, furious
*15:38.260- 15:44.300* :  protesters defying curfews, phenomenal scenes of people storming the presidential palace.
*15:51.740- 15:58.400* :  We've come two hours outside Colombo to a political rally, and it's held by Anorakumara
*15:58.400- 15:59.260* :  Desanayaka.
*15:59.860- 16:07.900* :  Now, he is running saying that he's the representative for the working class, and there's quite a
*16:07.900- 16:11.620* :  lot of people here, several thousand have come out to listen to him speak.
*16:13.700- 16:18.900* :  There's music, there are pink flags everywhere, people wearing bright pink hats.
*16:20.020- 16:24.260* :  I see a woman in front of me actually wearing a bright pink dress that matches his political
*16:24.260- 16:24.780* :  colors.
*16:27.180- 16:29.800* :  Desanayaka has become an unlikely frontman.
*16:30.320- 16:34.140* :  Also a strong contender, Saejit Bremadasa, leader of the opposition.
*16:34.960- 16:40.200* :  There are a total of 38 candidates in these elections, including the current president,
*16:40.720- 16:41.780* :  Ronald Viguer-Masinger.
*16:42.500- 16:47.800* :  Whoever becomes the next president of Sri Lanka has got big problems to solve, not just
*16:47.800- 16:51.300* :  the economy, but rebuilding the trust the people too.
*16:56.140- 17:00.520* :  Still to come, are we here from a father and daughter on the importance of getting
*17:00.520- 17:04.400* :  seek music, included in music exams here in the UK?
*17:04.960- 17:09.860* :  It will also help a lot of other young girls and young boys get closer to their religion
*17:10.060- 17:10.460* :  and faith.
*17:28.600- 17:31.180* :  It took a lifetime to find the person you want to marry.
*17:31.580- 17:34.420* :  Finding the perfect engagement ring is a lot easier.

*17:58.580- 17:59.300* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*17:59.300- 18:03.260* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*18:03.400- 18:05.920* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*18:06.260- 18:10.380* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*18:10.380- 18:13.660* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*18:13.960- 18:14.300* :  That's right.
*18:14.620- 18:18.940* :  We're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*18:33.740- 18:38.280* :  The government of the Netherlands, which is now a coalition dominated by the far-right
*18:38.280- 18:43.400* :  Freedom Party, has told the European Commission that it wants to opt out of common policies
*18:43.400- 18:44.160* :  on migration.
*18:44.220- 18:49.540* :  The previous government had agreed to an EU-packed on migration viewed as something ever
*18:49.540- 18:54.100* :  breakthrough for the bloc, our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Aberhardt reports.
*18:54.960- 18:59.840* :  Announcing the step on social media, the new Dutch asylum and migration minister, Maya
*18:59.840- 19:04.020* :  Line Farber, said her country needed to be in charge of its own asylum policy.
*19:04.720- 19:09.720* :  She belongs to the far-right anti-Islam Freedom Party of Het Wilders, the senior partner
*19:09.720- 19:10.960* :  in the coalition government.
*19:11.660- 19:13.840* :  It seeks to drastically limit migration.
*19:14.520- 19:17.660* :  The move may be more about posturing than having a real effect.
*19:18.360- 19:22.940* :  Last week, a spokesman for the European Commission poured cold water on the idea of the Netherlands
*19:22.940- 19:24.980* :  opting out of adopted legislation.
*19:25.920- 19:30.960* :  Optouts do exist in certain circumstances, but are rare and negotiated at treaty level
*19:30.960- 19:31.960* :  across the EU.
*19:32.380- 19:33.580* :  Danny Aberhardt.
*19:34.160- 19:39.280* :  President Joe Biden has called on Sudan's warring parties to re-engage in negotiations
*19:39.280- 19:43.360* :  to end their conflict, which has been raging for more than 17 months.
*19:43.920- 19:48.280* :  You might have heard the podcast recorded at this time yesterday when we heard the head
*19:48.280- 19:53.280* :  of the World Health Organization talking about the civil war saying starvation is almost
*19:53.280- 19:53.800* :  everywhere.
*19:54.120- 20:00.240* :  Close to 25 million people or half the Sudanese population are affected by famine, and it's
*20:00.240- 20:04.480* :  being made worse by the displacement of the population due to the fighting.
*20:04.840- 20:10.500* :  Our correspondent Barbara Plattasha is now in port Sudan, the de facto capital, since
*20:10.500- 20:15.240* :  the conflict began, and a key starting point to try to get aid in.
*20:15.600- 20:17.380* :  She gave us her first impressions.
*20:18.220- 20:19.500* :  It's a port city, obviously.
*20:19.700- 20:25.680* :  One of the key ports on the Red Sea, and there's a Corniche next to the water right across
*20:25.680- 20:31.400* :  from where all the main harbor is and where the ships come, and the evenings we've been
*20:31.400- 20:33.760* :  walking along the Corniche, and we're quite a lot of people out.
*20:34.000- 20:39.320* :  It's very, very hot here, and so in the evenings the people come out and sit on chairs
*20:39.320- 20:42.020* :  next to the water and their little cafes around.
*20:42.020- 20:45.600* :  We saw some children's splashing around in the water as well.
*20:46.160- 20:50.540* :  It's always been an important city, but it's become a much bigger factor in Sudan since
*20:50.540- 20:56.040* :  the war began last year, because the war is happening in the capital in Khartoum, and
*20:56.040- 21:00.480* :  so the army and the government and so on have basically moved here to port Sudan.
*21:00.480- 21:05.480* :  It's become the de facto capital, and so in a way it's become quite a bit of a hub,
*21:05.480- 21:08.840* :  like a functioning city, and people have been flooding in.
*21:08.840- 21:13.760* :  It's very, you get a lot of people coming in, not just the displaced people fleeing,
*21:13.760- 21:19.680* :  but you get people having moved from Khartoum because they were trying to escape the conflict,
*21:19.680- 21:22.320* :  but also to set up businesses, and so on.
*21:22.380- 21:25.860* :  So for example, we went to a place called the Grand Hotel.
*21:25.860- 21:28.940* :  Now the Grand Hotel in Khartoum is an icon.
*21:28.940- 21:32.500* :  It was built in the 1900s by the Sudanese Railway.
*21:32.500- 21:36.200* :  It's a beautiful, iconic sort of building here.
*21:36.200- 21:39.680* :  Now they said, well, we can't get to Khartoum, so we're going to open something called
*21:39.680- 21:45.640* :  the Grand Hotel here, much more functional, clean and new, but none of the flourishes
*21:45.640- 21:49.940* :  of the Grand Hotel here, and we saw a met a couple of women there who were just showing
*21:49.940- 21:50.320* :  us around.
*21:52.480- 21:52.540* :  They were workers.
*21:52.600- 21:54.780* :  They had come from Khartoum, and they're amongst many who've come from Khartoum here.
*21:54.780- 21:58.280* :  We went to the market, and it was bustling, absolutely crowded.
*21:58.920- 22:04.140* :  Many, many vendors, many people there, lots of goods to buy, including food, but the prices
*22:04.140- 22:05.200* :  are really, really high.
*22:05.200- 22:10.400* :  It's like a war economy, and I chatted with one young man who had come from Amdraman,
*22:10.400- 22:12.460* :  which is a sort of sister city to Khartoum.
*22:12.700- 22:17.180* :  He is a student, and he had been hoping to enter university there, but he said all the
*22:17.180- 22:20.420* :  universities, the schools had been shut down because of the war, so eventually he
*22:20.420- 22:22.820* :  ended up here in Port Sudan trying to find work.
*22:23.240- 22:25.500* :  Barbara Pletasha in Port Sudan.
*22:26.720- 22:32.000* :  When we think about climate change, we normally think about the immediate impacts, heat waves,
*22:32.000- 22:37.680* :  droughts and floods, but in fragile nations, climate change can do more damage than that.
*22:38.060- 22:41.120* :  Some analysts describe it as a chaos multiplier.
*22:41.120- 22:46.800* :  It can worsen existing conflicts by intensifying the competition for scarce resources.
*22:47.080- 22:52.220* :  So, what can be done to lift vulnerable nations out of this cycle of misery?
*22:52.700- 22:56.700* :  Our climate editor Justin Rowlett has been too Somalia to find out.
*22:57.360- 23:02.320* :  The country has just experienced its worst drought for 40 years.
*23:02.680- 23:08.160* :  An event scientist's reckon was made a hundred times more likely by human caused climate
*23:08.540- 23:08.560* :  change.
*23:08.820- 23:14.280* :  It left people literally biting, but access to water and to pasture.
*23:14.300- 23:17.600* :  The shake on Ismail, a local farmer.
*23:21.300- 23:23.540* :  There's no respect if you don't have a gun.
*23:24.620- 23:28.840* :  The harders who leave the animals into the farm stay back when they see my gun.
*23:29.140- 23:31.460* :  They get scared of it.
*23:35.100- 23:43.120* :  For the last 30 years Somalia has been experiencing a brutal Islamist insurgency, a civil war and
*23:43.120- 23:46.320* :  a whole series of regional and clan conflicts.
*23:47.120- 23:52.320* :  It means local disputes like these can easily spiral into full-blown battles.
*23:54.860- 24:00.120* :  And if you're not just drought, Somalia has experienced terrible floods as well.
*24:05.340- 24:07.540* :  The most vulnerable bear the brunt.
*24:15.120- 24:23.020* :  The U.N. estimates one and a half million children under the age of five are acutely malnourished.
*24:23.740- 24:29.460* :  This combination of climate change and conflict has driven four million Somalis a fifth of
*24:29.460- 24:33.300* :  the population into vast makeshift refugee camps.
*24:33.980- 24:38.840* :  The little international help people have been huffed made from rubbish they've scavenged.
*24:39.080- 24:42.600* :  They have to pay rent as well as for their food and water.
*24:42.960- 24:47.180* :  It means there is a huge reservoir of people desperate for paid work.
*24:47.820- 24:53.120* :  Like many men in the camps, Alima, Ali Muhammad's husband and four of her sons have taken
*24:53.120- 24:55.620* :  up the only opportunity and been to them.
*24:59.160- 25:04.420* :  They are rural people with no skill so the only work they could get was in the army.
*25:05.040- 25:10.960* :  They were desperate and when you are without food long enough and your children are looking
*25:10.960- 25:13.640* :  at you, you will do anything.
*25:16.480- 25:19.300* :  And it's not like climate changes as Somali people's fault.
*25:19.680- 25:24.560* :  The entire country has admitted roughly as much carbon dioxide from fossil fuels since
*25:24.560- 25:30.960* :  the fifties as the U.S. has in the last three days, yep, three days.
*25:31.900- 25:33.740* :  But Somalia is taking action.
*25:34.340- 25:40.740* :  We visited a power station moving over to wind and solar power and training up a new generation
*25:40.740- 25:42.980* :  of renewable energy engineers.
*25:42.980- 25:49.540* :  I met entrepreneurs, setting up new businesses, including a refugee woman who set up her own
*25:49.540- 25:50.820* :  cafe in the camp.
*25:51.640- 25:58.380* :  You can hear more of Justin's reporting from Somalia in the latest climate question podcast
*25:59.000- 26:04.300* :  by searching for BBC Climate Question on any podcast app you use.
*26:05.440- 26:11.600* :  Norway, one of the world's largest exporters of oil now has more electric vehicles on its
*26:11.600- 26:13.080* :  roads than petrol driven cars.
*26:13.080- 26:18.340* :  By the end of next year, it's aiming to become the first nation to end the sale of new
*26:18.340- 26:20.140* :  petrol and diesel cars.
*26:20.540- 26:24.660* :  Christina Buu is head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicles Association.
*26:25.560- 26:31.740* :  It's a real big milestone that we reached currently a bit more than 26% of all passenger
*26:31.740- 26:38.360* :  cars are full electric and we're not at 100% yet, but we are quickly getting there.
*26:38.660- 26:45.360* :  Norway has had a clear goal and the goal is that in 2025, next year, 100% of new sales
*26:45.360- 26:48.280* :  are to be serumation cars, electric or hydrogen.
*26:48.660- 26:53.560* :  To reach that goal, the politicians have used the measures they have, which is using our
*26:53.560- 27:00.900* :  tax system, accepting electric cars from taxes, but more importantly, also slowly increasing
*27:00.940- 27:07.040* :  the taxes on the sales of petrol and diesel engine cars, more and more, so making those
*27:07.040- 27:13.100* :  cars that we don't want more expensive and EVs more competitive, really, because in many
*27:13.100- 27:17.800* :  other countries in the world, most other countries, really, EVs are still a lot more expensive
*27:17.800- 27:19.060* :  to buy and to purchase.
*27:19.440- 27:23.720* :  And on top of that, there's also been, over the years, quite a few incentives when it
*27:23.720- 27:25.200* :  comes to using the EVs as well.
*27:25.500- 27:29.380* :  Christina Buu from the Norwegian Electric Vehicles Association.
*27:30.640- 27:33.640* :  Now, have you ever been to a Tupperware party?
*27:33.640- 27:38.540* :  My producer remembers her mum holding them growing up in the 1980s?
*27:38.660- 27:44.720* :  Well, it may be the end of an era as a Tupperware brand has just filed for bankruptcy in the
*27:44.720- 27:45.400* :  United States.
*27:45.500- 27:51.260* :  The firm, which makes the plastic containers beloved by cooks, is reportedly more than
*27:51.260- 27:53.200* :  $700 million in debt.
*27:53.720- 27:55.360* :  You just think the brand will get one forever.
*27:55.700- 27:58.000* :  So what's the reaction to this news?
*27:58.400- 28:03.220* :  My colleague Emma Barnett has been speaking to the chef, restaurant, her and Tupperware
*28:03.220- 28:04.860* :  fan Angela Hornett.
*28:05.340- 28:08.460* :  I think it's become generic with anything plastic in a kitchen.
*28:09.040- 28:13.120* :  You know, I mean, I'm sure I look in my kitchen as probably as some maybe Tupperware, but
*28:13.120- 28:17.060* :  otherwise, it's plastic containers that you can reuse and reuse, but you all call
*28:17.060- 28:19.600* :  it Tupperware because that's what you all think it is.
*28:20.360- 28:23.720* :  Yeah, I think, yeah, it's a shame, really, because I think one is obviously tragic for
*28:23.720- 28:27.500* :  the people losing their jobs and livelihoods, but as well, I think it's something given
*28:27.500- 28:30.040* :  that we're all about sustainability and reuse and stuff.
*28:30.040- 28:32.720* :  It's a great thing to have because you do reuse it.
*28:33.100- 28:35.220* :  You know, it's not having to cover stuff with a clean film.
*28:35.220- 28:39.360* :  It's not having to cover stuff with foil that you get rid of, you know, this stuff can
*28:39.360- 28:40.060* :  go on forever.
*28:40.560- 28:42.340* :  So I'm quite surprised that it has gone.
*28:42.580- 28:47.200* :  You can see it's the level of cost going up, transportation, use of raw materials, and
*28:47.200- 28:48.320* :  that's what's done it for them.
*28:48.440- 28:50.240* :  Is that a pet that's got a view in the background?
*28:50.760- 28:53.160* :  That is Betty Boo in the background, Betty here.
*28:53.160- 28:55.780* :  We cover her dog food and stuff, put it in a tough way.
*28:55.880- 28:56.540* :  Do you?
*28:56.540- 29:03.040* :  OK, well, what are the most important bits of detail about how you're storing anyone's
*29:03.040- 29:04.540* :  food, pet or human?
*29:06.080- 29:06.100* :  Yeah.
*29:06.100- 29:08.260* :  And just looking at the history of the firm, I mean, as you say, it's become a synonymous
*29:08.260- 29:10.080* :  word with all food storage containers.
*29:10.080- 29:16.900* :  But the company founded in 1946 by Earl Tupper, who patented the container's flexible airtight
*29:16.900- 29:21.520* :  seal, and became well known in the 50s and 60s when people, and I'm going to go for it
*29:21.520- 29:26.200* :  women, probably largely, held Tupperware parties to sell these containers.
*29:26.200- 29:28.300* :  Have you ever been to a Tupperware party on your own?
*29:28.360- 29:30.320* :  No, I don't say I have Emma Barnett.
*29:30.360- 29:30.640* :  Have you?
*29:31.840- 29:32.360* :  No, I haven't.
*29:33.380- 29:33.980* :  I haven't lived.
*29:33.980- 29:34.120* :  Shall we throw one?
*29:34.120- 29:34.380* :  We should.
*29:36.860- 29:36.880* :  Yeah.
*29:36.880- 29:38.860* :  Because I love, you know, the other thing I sort of think I always think about Tupperware.
*29:38.860- 29:43.860* :  As you see, it come up in so many programs like sitcoms or, you know, comedies.
*29:43.880- 29:46.100* :  You know, I always remember modern family, everyone arguing.
*29:46.100- 29:49.200* :  There was some thing about marking about someone's taking my Tupperware container.
*29:49.200- 29:49.280* :  Yes.
*29:49.560- 29:51.680* :  Because I think people feel very personal about it.
*29:51.720- 29:51.940* :  Oh, yeah.
*29:52.420- 29:55.740* :  You know, because they can put their Christmas cake in it, and they use that every year,
*29:55.740- 29:57.560* :  and it's that same container that seals it.
*29:58.220- 30:02.480* :  And I do ask my Tupperware plastic back when I give things out, and I have to say.
*30:03.200- 30:06.840* :  Chef Angela Hornett and her dog, Betty Boo.
*30:07.980- 30:13.220* :  We're going to end this podcast with some seek devotional music played by a father and
*30:13.260- 30:13.620* :  daughter.
*30:13.740- 30:19.480* :  The reason for doing so is that Sacred Seek Music, known as Kirtan, has now become part
*30:19.480- 30:24.140* :  of the universal eight grade music examination system here in the UK.
*30:24.140- 30:30.060* :  The top grades can count towards university entrance by what's known as the UCAS system
*30:30.460- 30:31.100* :  in Britain.
*30:31.360- 30:36.180* :  That means five South Asian string instruments can now be studied.
*30:36.580- 30:40.660* :  Hagenda Lali led the development of the exam grading system.
*30:41.080- 30:44.180* :  Hagenda's 13-year-old daughter, Nana Ki.
*30:44.180- 30:49.760* :  Lali has been learning to play the Sarungi since she was five years old and seeing with
*30:49.760- 30:49.920* :  it.
*30:50.260- 30:55.980* :  She's been telling my colleague, Amal Rajan, why it was important to get this accreditation.
*30:56.720- 31:01.000* :  What we wanted to see was to get the recognition, rigor and value.
*31:01.000- 31:05.460* :  So children are learning these instruments, they're learning how to sing, but they're not
*31:05.460- 31:09.500* :  getting the recognition, and it was really important that we set something up, that would
*31:09.500- 31:10.760* :  get them that recognition.
*31:11.320- 31:15.380* :  And as far as the rigor is concerned, set something up, that tutors can apply rigorously
*31:15.380- 31:19.700* :  and give them kind of staged learning and give them a kind of sense of progression.
*31:20.080- 31:23.980* :  And what kind of reaction have you had to this news, both within the seat community and
*31:23.980- 31:24.380* :  beyond?
*31:24.600- 31:28.620* :  It's been phenomenal, so we're sitting here at the BBC Studios today, but we've also
*31:28.620- 31:30.760* :  been contacted by schools in India.
*31:31.480- 31:35.960* :  We're launching it in Baltimore, Seattle and Houston, so it's kind of gone all around
*31:35.960- 31:37.940* :  the world pretty quickly within a week.
*31:38.080- 31:41.920* :  And how important is it to you that the next generation, including girls like your daughter,
*31:42.340- 31:43.220* :  are playing these instruments?
*31:43.800- 31:48.600* :  Well, it's part of our cultural heritage, it's part of our faith, and we want to preserve
*31:48.600- 31:48.960* :  this.
*31:49.260- 31:54.120* :  And I think one way of doing that is to give them that recognition, that we're going
*31:54.120- 31:55.840* :  to get something out of this in the end.
*31:56.300- 32:01.320* :  And to top it all off, obviously, the UCAS recognition is kind of, you know, that you
*32:01.320- 32:02.240* :  couldn't get any better than that, really.
*32:02.260- 32:04.840* :  Is your lovely 13-year-old daughter Nanaki there?
*32:04.880- 32:05.580* :  Are you there, Nanaki?
*32:05.820- 32:06.240* :  Oh, yes.
*32:06.540- 32:06.900* :  Hello.
*32:07.460- 32:08.640* :  So you play the saranghi.
*32:08.640- 32:11.240* :  Just tell us a bit about that instrument and how hard it is to play.
*32:11.820- 32:16.880* :  The saranghi is super hard because you have to be able to find the pitch on it without
*32:16.880- 32:21.360* :  having any frets, and you have to be able to bone a straight line, and you have to sing
*32:21.360- 32:22.200* :  it at the same time.
*32:22.380- 32:23.360* :  So it's super hard.
*32:23.560- 32:26.440* :  I think there are a lot of people who don't actually know what any of that means, so it sounds
*32:26.440- 32:27.020* :  very hard.
*32:27.260- 32:28.700* :  How often do you practice Nanaki?
*32:29.100- 32:33.700* :  Me and my dad practice every day at, like, seven-ish for half an hour.
*32:33.980- 32:34.500* :  Every day?
*32:34.880- 32:35.100* :  Yeah.
*32:35.560- 32:36.520* :  Not before school, surely.
*32:36.820- 32:38.120* :  No, after school, yeah.
*32:38.660- 32:41.080* :  And just from your point of view, Nanaki, how cool is it?
*32:41.080- 32:45.780* :  How important is it that these amazing instruments and the culture they're part of is now
*32:45.780- 32:47.280* :  recognised in this formal way?
*32:47.580- 32:51.820* :  I think that it's really great, because I'm going to start playing CUNY in quite a few
*32:51.820- 32:55.680* :  years away, but that will really help me, and they will also help a lot of other young
*32:55.680- 32:59.700* :  girls and young boys get closer to their religion and face.
*33:00.200- 33:03.220* :  We're going to end the programme with a live demonstration of this music.
*33:03.220- 33:08.580* :  We've got in the studio Aftas Singh, who is a Taos player from the NUM DERRY community.
*33:09.060- 33:11.600* :  Here is Aftas Singh playing the Taos.
*33:12.720- 33:38.420* :  Aftas Singh, a Taos player from the NUM DERRY community.
