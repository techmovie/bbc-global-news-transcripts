*00:20.140- 00:26.420* :  facing Boeing after failures of its Starliner spacecraft have left two astronauts stranded in
*00:26.420- 00:32.160* :  space. They were supposed to be on the International Space Station for eight days, but will now be
*00:32.160- 00:37.760* :  there for at least eight months. This is the latest in a long line of crises facing the company.
*00:38.500- 00:43.700* :  So is this one failure too far for Boeing? Find us wherever you get your podcasts.

*00:53.760- 00:58.300* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Tuesday the third of September.
*00:58.380- 01:03.060* :  Despite pressure from hostage families, the Israeli public and even President Biden,
*01:03.060- 01:07.740* :  the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he won't make concessions to a
*01:07.740- 01:13.660* :  grievous cease-fire deal with Hamas. The mayor of Paris wants the Olympic rings to stay on the
*01:13.660- 01:18.280* :  Eiffel Tower forever and how to hold a fashion show in a war zone.
*01:21.600- 01:25.720* :  Also in this podcast, the bow of Titanic, that's what you think of when you think of the shipwreck
*01:26.180- 01:30.240* :  and it doesn't look like that anymore. It's just another reminder of the deterioration
*01:30.240- 01:35.000* :  that's happening every day. People ask all the time how long is Titanic going to be there. We don't
*01:35.000- 01:41.640* :  know, but we're watching it in real time. Underwater robots reveal how much the Titanic has decayed.
*01:46.540- 01:51.360* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is undergrowing pressure to secure the release of
*01:51.360- 01:57.840* :  the remaining hostages in Gaza after six were found dead in a tunnel on Saturday. Hostage families
*01:57.840- 02:02.620* :  say their loved ones would still be alive if Mr. Netanyahu had not been so reluctant to reach
*02:02.620- 02:08.260* :  a deal with Hamas. He has insisted the only way to prevent a repeat of the 7th of October massacre
*02:08.260- 02:13.640* :  is to ensure the Palestinian group is totally defeated. But critics say he's stringing out
*02:13.640- 02:19.260* :  negotiations in order to hold on to power. President Biden has added his voice to those calling
*02:19.260- 02:23.600* :  on Mr. Netanyahu to do more. He was speaking to reporters as he arrived at the White House.
*02:24.120- 02:28.640* :  Are you planning to present a final hospital deal for the both sides of this week?
*02:28.860- 02:33.780* :  We're very close to that. What makes you think that this deal will be successful in a way
*02:33.780- 02:41.920* :  that the other deals were not? Mr. President, if you think it's time for Prime Minister Netanyahu
*02:42.200- 02:46.020* :  to do more on this issue, do you think he's doing enough? No.
*02:47.420- 02:52.740* :  Well Mr. Biden's comments came as thousands of Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv and
*02:52.740- 02:58.100* :  Jerusalem after a day that saw many workers going on strike. But the Israeli Prime Minister
*02:58.100- 03:03.720* :  shows no sign of being willing to compromise. In a TV address, he said Israel would not agree to
*03:03.720- 03:09.180* :  a demand to withdraw from a narrow strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border known as the
*03:09.180- 03:15.020* :  Philadelphia Corridor. What has changed in the last five days? What has changed? One thing,
*03:15.660- 03:21.820* :  these murderers executed six of our hostages. They shot them in the back of the head.
*03:22.680- 03:29.860* :  That's what's changed. And now after this, we're asked to show seriousness. We're asked to make
*03:29.860- 03:36.720* :  concessions. What message does this send Hamas? It says, kill more hostages, murder more hostages,
*03:36.720- 03:42.200* :  you've got more concessions. The pressure internationally must be directed at these killers,
*03:43.140- 03:49.820* :  at Hamas, not at Israel. We need maximum pressure on Hamas. I don't believe that I the President Biden
*03:49.820- 03:56.360* :  or anyone serious about achieving peace and achieving the release would seriously ask Israel,
*03:57.280- 04:02.860* :  Israel, to make these concessions. Our diplomatic correspondent James Landel is in Jerusalem.
*04:02.860- 04:09.000* :  I asked him what he made of Mr. Netanyahu speech. What you heard, I think this evening, was a mixture
*04:09.000- 04:18.240* :  of contrition, but also defiance. You had the contrition of a Prime Minister of Israel, begging the
*04:18.240- 04:27.360* :  forgiveness of the hostage families, those who lost their lives in recent days, and saying that
*04:27.360- 04:33.700* :  Israel got very close to rescuing them, but in his words, not close enough, and asking the families
*04:33.700- 04:39.060* :  for their forgiveness. He also tried to associate himself with the families, saying that he was part
*04:39.060- 04:44.640* :  of what he called the community of the bereaved, an apparent reference to the fact that he lost
*04:44.640- 04:50.040* :  his brother in an Israeli military operation many, many years ago, saying that he was part of
*04:50.200- 04:54.320* :  that community, and only if you have suffered that kind of bereavement, can you understand the pain
*04:54.320- 04:59.260* :  and sorry of what the families are going through. So there was that, but on the other hand, there was
*05:00.140- 05:07.260* :  very, very defiant defense of his policy position, saying now is the time for unity, now is not
*05:07.260- 05:13.400* :  a time for cabinet ministers in Israel to squabble, and a very strong defense of the idea that
*05:13.560- 05:19.840* :  if there is to be any ceasefire deal, Israeli forces have to remain in that border corridor
*05:19.840- 05:26.540* :  in southern Gaza on the border with Israel, what he calls the Philadelphia corridor. And it was
*05:26.540- 05:31.620* :  an astonishing defense of that. The Prime Minister even sort of gave us a PowerPoint presentation
*05:31.680- 05:37.220* :  about it with maps, and essentially his argument was that if Israel gives up control of that,
*05:37.220- 05:43.120* :  that buffer zone, then Hamas will in future be able to continue rearming itself and remain
*05:43.120- 05:48.580* :  a threat to Israel in the future. That is a defense of his position, it is not one held by many
*05:48.580- 05:53.640* :  figures, senior figures in Israel's defense establishment, it is not an argument that is supported
*05:53.640- 05:59.440* :  by the families of the hostages, who say no, that simply isn't, doesn't wash, and that actually
*05:59.440- 06:04.000* :  what needs to happen now, the greater priority is to secure the release of those hostages,
*06:04.000- 06:08.100* :  otherwise more are going to die as happened in recent days. You mentioned the families,
*06:08.100- 06:13.840* :  some in the military, he's also facing pressure from Joe Biden, people on the streets in Israel
*06:13.840- 06:18.560* :  and some in his own cabinet, where does it go from here? Well, the supporters of the hostages,
*06:18.680- 06:22.400* :  and those people who are on the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv tonight, hope that we've reached
*06:22.400- 06:27.340* :  a tipping point, but I have to say we have reached these moments before, so far in this war,
*06:27.600- 06:33.760* :  and thus far the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu has not shifted its position. What has
*06:33.760- 06:37.360* :  been interesting is that while the political pressure continues, the economic
*06:37.360- 06:43.660* :  pressure today was perhaps less than some had hoped for. Yes, there was a general strike,
*06:43.660- 06:47.920* :  and there was, this was the first time this had happened since the war began, but it was patchy,
*06:47.920- 06:54.020* :  it was not deep, it was not a comprehensive strike, so the economic pressure isn't there yet.
*06:54.020- 07:00.140* :  The political pressure, though, does continue, but all the signs now is that he remains
*07:00.140- 07:05.900* :  defiant, and he thinks he'll keep enough political support for that argument until he
*07:05.900- 07:09.260* :  doesn't, and then he will change. James Landau in Jerusalem
*07:10.180- 07:15.460* :  Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, radical Israeli settlers have seized the opportunity
*07:15.460- 07:20.880* :  to take over land in the other, much larger Palestinian territory, the occupied West Bank,
*07:20.880- 07:25.960* :  forcing Palestinians from their homes. Instead of the traditional urban settlements,
*07:26.000- 07:31.340* :  they are establishing what are called herding outposts, with the intention of controlling large
*07:31.340- 07:37.900* :  tracts of land. While these settlements are illegal, BBCI investigations has found evidence
*07:37.900- 07:43.800* :  that they are supported by an Israeli government-funded organization, Amir Nadir reports.
*07:46.760- 07:49.060* :  Muhammad is playing an audio message on his phone.
*07:49.520- 07:56.400* :  Listen, the voice says, I will tell you this only once, you have two days to leave the area.
*07:56.960- 08:00.600* :  Muhammad's mother, Aysha, wonders if it's a settler, they know well.
*08:02.060- 08:08.160* :  He's a settler called Moussha, but we call him Moussa. He's the one who kicked us out.
*08:11.600- 08:16.460* :  In October 2023, a few days after the Hamas attack on Israel, Aysha and her husband,
*08:16.460- 08:23.540* :  Nebel, were forced off their land in the Jordan Valley. Recently, the couple were able to
*08:28.460- 08:31.580* :  briefly return home. In the kitchen, all the cupboard doors have been thrown open,
*08:31.580- 08:36.540* :  and the drawers pulled out. In the living room, the sofas have been slashed so that the foam
*08:36.540- 08:43.820* :  stuffing shows through. Outdoors, her husband, Nebel, points to where the tap has been snapped off
*08:43.820- 08:50.200* :  the water tank, and the solar panels have been smashed. This farmland is mine.
*08:51.180- 08:57.260* :  Ten dunams here, 20 dunams there, and 10 dunams around the house. That's my home.
*08:59.800- 09:06.000* :  They were kicked out at Gunpoint, Aysha says, and she accuses a local settler of putting a gun to her head.
*09:07.300- 09:12.800* :  The man she is accusing is called Moussa Sharavit, an Israeli settler in his late 20s.
*09:13.060- 09:17.680* :  In this video published on his website, he presents in a delicate view of life in the rich
*09:17.680- 09:23.900* :  agricultural landscape of the West Bank. But the group of farm buildings that he set up,
*09:23.900- 09:29.420* :  what's known as a hurting outpost, is illegal under Israeli law, and we've discovered how some
*09:29.420- 09:34.520* :  settlers like Moussa Sharavit have received support from powerful groups. One of them,
*09:34.520- 09:39.240* :  the world's ionist organization, is more than a hundred years old. One of its key departments
*09:39.240- 09:44.980* :  is the Settlement Division, funded by the Israeli government. It's a buddy which runs very, very,
*09:44.980- 09:51.720* :  very big part of a land which had been expropriated by the Israeli authorities in the West Bank,
*09:51.720- 09:58.220* :  to different Israeli settlements or settlers. This is Draut Eskis, an Israeli activist who
*09:58.220- 10:03.320* :  tracks the construction of Israeli settlements and outposts. The BBC has seen documents that show
*10:03.320- 10:08.980* :  how the WZO has allocated large areas of land in the occupied West Bank to settlers. They
*10:08.980- 10:19.300* :  forbid the building of any structures. Draut Eskis shows us a contract on his mobile phone between
*10:19.300- 10:24.760* :  the WZO and a settler whose name's been redacted, so we can't be sure if it's Moussa Sharavit,
*10:25.140- 10:33.700* :  but it does match the date he moved to the area. Moussa Sharavit has been sanctioned by the UK,
*10:33.700- 10:39.060* :  accused of forcing around 20 Palestinian families off their land, but we found a pattern of other
*10:39.060- 10:44.620* :  settlers who've established illegal outposts on land allocated by the WZO. Two of those settlers
*10:44.620- 10:50.480* :  have also recently been sanctioned by the UK for violence against local Palestinians. The WZO
*10:50.480- 10:56.620* :  didn't respond to our questions. To get to Moussa Sharavit's outpost, you have to drive up a long
*10:56.920- 11:01.700* :  winding gravel track. He hasn't responded to any of our attempts to try and speak with him,
*11:02.000- 11:04.860* :  so that was our chance to try and put our questions to him.
*11:08.460- 11:14.220* :  Moussa comes to meet us outside the farm gate. His brother David follows him, filming us on his
*11:14.220- 11:19.960* :  mobile. He has an assault rifle over one shoulder. Moussa has a handgun stuck in his waistband.
*11:20.480- 11:24.100* :  We've spoken to a lot of the Palestinian families here who say that you've used violence on them,
*11:24.100- 11:28.780* :  forced them out of their homes. Maybe it's a different Moussa, I don't know him.
*11:29.280- 11:33.620* :  It was definitely you who filmed you. We've spoken to a Palestinian woman who says you put a gun to
*11:33.620- 11:39.900* :  her head. I'm sorry. I don't know about it. Maybe it's another Moussa. There are a lot of
*11:39.900- 11:44.540* :  Moussa's here. It's a very common name in Israel. It is unquestionably Moussa Sharavit.
*11:44.540- 11:50.660* :  The Moussa Sharavit who appears in his own promotional videos. He says again that he doesn't
*11:50.660- 11:56.100* :  know what I'm talking about and turns away. Since October, settlers have stepped up their efforts
*11:56.100- 12:00.140* :  to build illegal outposts in the West Bank, but despite international sanctions,
*12:00.700- 12:03.540* :  they remain undeturbed and increasingly powerful.
*12:06.800- 12:11.740* :  Relations between Finland and his giant neighbour Russia took a downturn when Russian troops
*12:11.740- 12:16.660* :  launched their full-scale invasion of Ukraine two and a half years ago. Finland imposed sanctions,
*12:16.660- 12:22.540* :  expelled Russian diplomats, and eventually joined NATO, much to President Putin's anger.
*12:23.080- 12:28.080* :  Now, the Finnish government says it intends to stop Russian citizens buying property in Finland
*12:28.080- 12:32.760* :  in order to protect national security. I heard more from my reporter, Roosterpucker.
*12:33.540- 12:37.080* :  The main problem is not the number of these properties. There aren't that many of them,
*12:37.080- 12:41.380* :  about three and a half thousand, but where they are and many of them are in very strategic
*12:41.380- 12:46.460* :  locations like near Air Force bases, garrisons, main power lines, and even the main shipping lane
*12:46.460- 12:51.180* :  between Finland and Sweden. And the concerns about the threat they pose, it's pretty realistic
*12:51.280- 12:56.360* :  about a year ago, if you remember, a Russian man vessel cut to the main electricity cable between
*12:56.360- 13:02.100* :  Finland and Estonia. There's also been more or less constant and massive jamming of GPS signals
*13:02.100- 13:06.900* :  in the region. A couple of months ago, the Finnish carrier Finne had to stop its flight to
*13:06.900- 13:11.780* :  directly in Estonia because of that. And to that, the fact that Russians have been caught flying
*13:11.780- 13:16.780* :  drones over nuclear power stations in Sweden, and military areas in Norway, so I'd say most
*13:16.780- 13:22.460* :  Finns are pretty worried. Now this is just currently a proposal, so will it happen, and if so,
*13:22.460- 13:26.880* :  how much difference will it make? It will absolutely happen, the government has got a very clear
*13:26.880- 13:31.860* :  majority in Parliament, and these measures have already been widely debated, and they are supported
*13:31.860- 13:36.340* :  by the main opposition parties. There have been some queries from some legal specialists,
*13:36.360- 13:41.160* :  but they are mainly to do with the detail of the proposals. These are not seen as controversial
*13:41.160- 13:46.740* :  moves, but ones that are essential for Finland's security. Hopefully, I think this is what the
*13:46.740- 13:52.220* :  government is thinking, this will put a stop to a development that has been allowed to go on for
*13:52.220- 13:57.920* :  too long. And it feeds into the wider dispute between the two countries. Have we had any reaction
*13:57.920- 14:03.140* :  from Russia and what do people in Finland make of it? There's been no reaction from Moscow today.
*14:03.140- 14:07.760* :  I mean, previously, the Russians have said that any restrictions on them buying property in Finland
*14:07.760- 14:13.280* :  is a gross human rights violation. As far as relations with Russia and what Finns think about
*14:13.280- 14:18.340* :  them are concerned, I don't think Finns really see that there is a dispute just between their
*14:18.340- 14:23.040* :  country, and Russia, the overwhelming majority, would say that Russia is waging an illegal war of
*14:23.040- 14:28.260* :  conquest against Ukraine. This, of course, is something Finns say they have been subjected to countless
*14:28.260- 14:33.200* :  times over the centuries, and that the dispute is between those upholding, seeking to uphold,
*14:33.200- 14:37.720* :  at least, a rules-based international order, and those seeking to destroy it.
*14:37.920- 14:43.900* :  Ristapurka. The mayor of Paris and Idalgo has provoked controversy in the French capital by saying
*14:43.900- 14:49.440* :  she wants to keep the Olympic rings on the Eiffel Tower as a permanent fixture after the games
*14:49.440- 14:52.460* :  are over. Parisians are divided on the idea.
*14:56.460- 15:02.240* :  This Eiffel Tower is quite beautiful decorated in these Olympic rings. Above all, the values
*15:02.240- 15:08.100* :  conveyed by them are fabulous. It's our way of showing our attachment to these international
*15:08.100- 15:12.480* :  values of peace, of solidarity. So yeah, I think it's a great idea.
*15:17.240- 15:21.980* :  Know that the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games are going to finish, I think we have to move
*15:21.980- 15:28.060* :  on. I'm not for keeping the rings after the games are over. The five rings weigh 30 tons, so
*15:28.060- 15:33.120* :  why does Anidalgo want to keep them on the Eiffel Tower? Husekofield is our Paris correspondent.
*15:33.780- 15:37.560* :  Well, I suppose the cynic would say because she doesn't want the party to end. It's just like
*15:37.560- 15:41.940* :  something the day after Christmas, wishing Christmas could be extended into boxing day. It's been a
*15:41.940- 15:46.980* :  very successful Olympic Games. She's obviously high on the buzz of it all, and for once people have
*15:46.980- 15:51.620* :  been talking up the French experience, the Paris experience, and that is an experience she wants
*15:51.620- 15:56.880* :  to perpetuate. That's, I guess, a cynical view. I mean, maybe she would respond by saying no,
*15:56.880- 16:02.000* :  we think the rings have a proper place on the Eiffel Tower, and it was such an important Olympic
*16:02.000- 16:07.080* :  Games that they deserve to stay there, but I suspect that history will treat this idea rather
*16:07.120- 16:11.980* :  less kindly, you know, time moves on. The Olympics will be forgotten, and I think I can't
*16:11.980- 16:16.520* :  imagine how in a year from now they would look appropriate there at all. Yeah, I mean, who has the
*16:16.520- 16:21.180* :  final say over whether they could stay on the Eiffel Tower? In theory, I think she does because
*16:21.180- 16:25.960* :  the Eiffel Tower does belong to the city of Paris, but, you know, there is a wave of opposition,
*16:25.960- 16:31.380* :  spearheaded by, not least, the culture minister, that's Rashida Datti, who's a long-time
*16:31.380- 16:37.760* :  enemy of Anidalga in the Paris City Hall, and Rashida Datti is pointing out that apart from
*16:37.760- 16:42.820* :  belonging to the city of Paris, the monument is also a historic monument, which is covered by all
*16:42.820- 16:47.880* :  sorts of rules, and therefore the city, even though it owns it, can't just willy-nilly do what it
*16:47.880- 16:54.100* :  wants with it. So, I mean, it's shaping up if Anidalga persists to be a big legal battle about whether
*16:54.100- 16:59.760* :  or not they can stay there. Rashida Datti says that the permission to put them up thus far was
*16:59.940- 17:04.480* :  kind of gesture towards the Olympic Games, but it was only ever intended that they'd be there in
*17:04.480- 17:08.740* :  a kind of temporary way. And do we know what happens to the rings normally after an Olympics?
*17:09.160- 17:12.960* :  I don't know, a general story of the Olympic rings, but I know that after the London Olympic
*17:12.960- 17:18.880* :  Games, they were taken down and recycled. There were some at the St. Pancras Station, which
*17:18.880- 17:22.960* :  were taken down, and apparently were turned into seating, coloured seating at St. Pancras Station,
*17:22.960- 17:28.420* :  so you can actually still go and sit on an Olympic ring in the environs of St. Pancras Station,
*17:28.420- 17:31.960* :  but otherwise they just get taken down and repurposed. I'm sure that's what's happened in every
*17:31.960- 17:36.020* :  other city, and it does seem, I suspect, probably what's going to happen here, too.
*17:36.540- 17:42.160* :  Husegovelled in Paris. A British woman is thought to have set a new world record for the fastest
*17:42.160- 17:49.600* :  female swim across Lake Geneva. Sam Farrow took 22 hours and 48 minutes to cover a distance of almost
*17:49.600- 17:55.480* :  73 kilometres. She only stopped to tread water while having food or drink, or occasionally to
*17:55.480- 18:01.040* :  roll up into a ball to bend her spine because of cramp and backache. She's been talking to Sarah
*18:01.040- 18:06.100* :  Montague. When we booked the swim originally, I just wanted to see how far I could go. I
*18:06.100- 18:09.860* :  wanted to see if I could finish it. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be the fastest
*18:09.860- 18:14.560* :  woman. We went about five hours faster than I was expecting. I think it was just a really good
*18:14.560- 18:19.400* :  combination of good weather, good currents, and just being stronger than I thought it was,
*18:19.400- 18:24.320* :  it just goes to show what your body can achieve. My longest previous swim was about 36 kilometres,
*18:24.860- 18:29.960* :  so everything after that was unknown for myself in the crew. About 55 came, my back really started
*18:30.440- 18:35.620* :  to fatigue, and that's when the cramps and the pain really started. I think your mind gives in
*18:35.620- 18:40.800* :  long before your body gives in, so if you can keep your head positive, you can get there in the end,
*18:40.800- 18:45.480* :  so every time that my brain tried to tell me that I couldn't do it, I just tried to try and
*18:45.480- 18:49.620* :  flip it and think, right, it's 4am, you're in the middle of Lake Geneva, how special is this?
*18:49.680- 18:54.220* :  Not many people get the chance to do this, and I was also really lucky that I had two women on my
*18:54.220- 18:59.940* :  crew, Jane and Claire, who alternated, Claire would swim for an hour with me, and then my friend Jane
*18:59.940- 19:03.120* :  would get in the kayak and kayak for an hour with me, so I was never on my own.
*19:03.600- 19:06.200* :  And then the feeling when you did it? What was that like?
*19:07.700- 19:11.940* :  What a relief that was on dry land, but also I don't think it's quite kicked in yet, I've not had,
*19:12.320- 19:15.160* :  not really had the emotions yet, I think it's all a bit of a shock still.
*19:15.460- 19:16.720* :  Is there a next swim?
*19:16.980- 19:19.600* :  There definitely will be, we'll plan another big swim for next year,
*19:20.120- 19:24.360* :  if we can do 70k, let's see how far we can go really, but it's just finding the right location
*19:24.420- 19:26.760* :  and boats and crews and things, so we'll see.
*19:27.480- 19:29.300* :  Sam Farrow talking to Sarah Montague
*19:32.420- 19:34.640* :  And still to come on the global news podcast?
*19:36.220- 19:40.760* :  Everyone I know who uses eggs gets a bit lost between what is real and what is fake.
*19:41.240- 19:45.520* :  If Elon Musk wants to come here and things this is of an unrepublic, he's wrong.
*19:46.200- 19:49.360* :  How do Brazilians feel about the banning of eggs?
*19:55.880- 20:03.200* :  I'm Sumis Omaskanda from the Global Story Podcast where we're looking at the problems facing
*20:03.200- 20:09.380* :  Boeing after failures of its Starliner spacecraft have left two astronauts stranded in space.
*20:10.160- 20:13.500* :  They were supposed to be on the International Space Station for eight days,
*20:14.160- 20:16.540* :  but will now be there for at least eight months.
*20:17.400- 20:20.360* :  This is the latest in a long line of crises facing the company,
*20:21.120- 20:23.800* :  so is this one failure too far for Boeing?
*20:24.680- 20:26.280* :  Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
*20:32.580- 20:37.380* :  The wreck of the Titanic was found in 1985, more than 70 years after its
*20:37.380- 20:42.740* :  sank on its maiden voyage in the North Atlantic. The latest expedition to the wreck site on the
*20:42.740- 20:48.640* :  Ocean floor has revealed the slow decay of the liner's famous bow. Our science editor Rebecca
*20:48.640- 20:52.600* :  Morrell was given exclusive access to footage taken by underwater robots.
*20:53.340- 20:58.520* :  It's the image that made Titanic instantly recognizable. The bow of the doomed liner
*20:58.520- 21:03.500* :  looming out of the darkness of the Atlantic deep, but this image has changed forever.
*21:04.160- 21:08.680* :  A four and a half meter long section of railing is now missing from the front of the ship,
*21:08.680- 21:14.180* :  having tumbled to the seafloor. The expedition team thinks it fell at some point in the last two
*21:14.180- 21:20.620* :  years. Dives in 2022 showed the railing intact but buckling. The loss is a consequence of the
*21:20.620- 21:26.280* :  ongoing deterioration of the ship. After 112 years beneath the waves, it's being eroded
*21:26.280- 21:30.600* :  by salt water and microbes are eating away at the huge metal structure.
*21:30.600- 21:36.380* :  Thomasine Array is the director of collections at RMS Titanic Inc, who carried out the expedition.
*21:36.700- 21:43.520* :  You have all these moments in pop culture and it's just iconic to see the bow of Titanic. That's
*21:43.520- 21:47.560* :  what you think of when you think of the shipwreck and it doesn't look like that anymore. It's just
*21:47.560- 21:52.840* :  another reminder of the deterioration that's happening every day. People ask all the time how long
*21:52.840- 21:56.580* :  is Titanic going to be there. We don't know, but we're watching it in real time.
*21:56.920- 22:02.260* :  The expedition gathered more than two million images and hours of footage of the wreck. It's
*22:02.260- 22:06.540* :  still being reviewed to catalogue the finds, but the team has announced one major discovery,
*22:06.540- 22:12.540* :  a 60-centimeter tall bronze statue called the Diana of Versailles, which once adorned the first
*22:12.540- 22:17.720* :  class lounge. The figure was found lying face-up in the debris field that surrounds the wreck.
*22:18.220- 22:23.300* :  Our science editor, Rebecca Morrell. The social media platform X is facing the loss of one of
*22:23.300- 22:28.420* :  its largest markets in an argument over hate speech and disinformation. On Friday,
*22:28.420- 22:34.000* :  Brazil's telecom regulator suspended access to it for the country's 200-plus million people
*22:34.000- 22:39.980* :  after a ruling by a senior judge. On Monday, the Brazilian Supreme Court upheld that ruling.
*22:39.980- 22:44.140* :  It's being seen as the most serious crisis yet for Elon Musk's platform.
*22:44.680- 22:47.000* :  Our business reporter David Wadell has the story.
*22:49.400- 22:55.460* :  When Elon Musk took control of Twitter two years ago in a $44 billion deal rebranding it X,
*22:55.900- 22:59.580* :  he signaled there would be far fewer restrictions on what people could post.
*23:00.840- 23:06.540* :  Mr. Musk calls himself a free speech absolutist as he told the BBC's James Clayton last year.
*23:06.760- 23:13.120* :  Free speech is meaningless unless you allow people you don't like to say things you don't like,
*23:13.680- 23:19.280* :  otherwise it's relevant. And if at the point of which you lose a free speech, it doesn't come back.
*23:20.480- 23:24.460* :  Since then, the platform and its owner have faced constant controversy.
*23:25.240- 23:29.940* :  Individuals banned from Twitter, including controversial influencer Andrew Tate,
*23:30.220- 23:34.640* :  and the UK far-right activist Tommy Robinson, were reinstated by X.
*23:35.500- 23:40.700* :  During violent far-right protests this summer in the UK, Mr. Musk found himself in a
*23:40.700- 23:46.680* :  rye with Prime Minister Sukkier Starmer, after posting that civil war is inevitable and accusing
*23:46.680- 23:54.440* :  the government of two-tier policing. Mr. Musk's latest rye threatens X's position in one of its
*23:54.440- 24:02.180* :  biggest markets. Over the weekend, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandra de Mareish ordered
*24:02.180- 24:07.580* :  the platform to be shut down across the country. It comes after a month's long feud over alleged
*24:07.580- 24:13.920* :  misinformation and hate speech on the platform, in which Mr. Musk called the judge an evil dictator.
*24:16.780- 24:21.460* :  People my age aren't really in the habit of watching TV news or reading the news,
*24:21.820- 24:25.920* :  and Twitter, or X, was a way at least for me to get news from around the world.
*24:26.600- 24:31.680* :  So I've lost touch a little with what's happening around the world and a way of entertaining myself.
*24:33.620- 24:39.340* :  X was a much freer space for various forms of speech, so much so that there was a lot of
*24:39.340- 24:44.240* :  discrimination. So honestly, I do see a positive side to Twitter being shut down,
*24:44.660- 24:49.860* :  but there were also many good movements, campaigns, and NGOs that have lost their space.
*24:51.420- 24:55.840* :  Everyone I know who uses X gets a bit lost between what is real and what is fake,
*24:55.840- 25:00.180* :  but I don't think it has to be all or nothing. There could be some regulation there.
*25:00.560- 25:04.860* :  If Elon Musk wants to come here and thinks this is a banana republic, he's wrong.
*25:05.500- 25:11.600* :  The arrest in France last month of Pavleduroff, CEO of Messaging Up Telegram, has raised the
*25:11.600- 25:17.700* :  sticks in the debate. France has rejected claims that CEO can't be held responsible for illegal
*25:17.700- 25:24.100* :  content shared on the platform, but Elon Musk hinted on X over the weekend that it's probably
*25:24.100- 25:29.540* :  wise for me to limit movements to countries where free speech is constitutionally protected.
*25:30.160- 25:36.680* :  David Woodell reporting. The last time Ukraine staged its own fashion week was back in 2022,
*25:36.780- 25:42.700* :  but after three seasons on the road, in London, Paris, Copenhagen, and Berlin, the event is now
*25:42.700- 25:48.060* :  finally back in Kiev. Safety measures include equipping venues with bombshellters.
*25:48.320- 25:53.040* :  Many designers expect there shows to be interrupted by the sounds of sirens, but say they'll just
*25:53.040- 25:58.240* :  start up again immediately afterwards. So what's it like holding a fashion event in a war zone?
*25:58.240- 26:04.560* :  We heard from two Ukrainian designers who are attending, Julie Jamos-Nuyuk, owner of the brand
*26:04.560- 26:10.720* :  JMM, as well as Elvira Gasanova, a designer originally from Donetsk, now living in Kiev.
*26:11.200- 26:16.920* :  It was difficult because of that when you do some fashion show in different countries, it's not about
*26:17.480- 26:23.640* :  your show because you can't invite your clients, you can't do all that you can when you do it
*26:23.960- 26:29.900* :  in your home because tomorrow I will have my show in Kiev and we do our big show with a lot of
*26:29.900- 26:36.120* :  clients, with a lot of celebrities, Ukrainians, with a lot of friends of the brand, and it's really
*26:36.120- 26:43.760* :  another part of all that we're doing, and if someone tells that it's not okay because it's war in
*26:43.760- 26:48.740* :  Ukraine, we know that it's really important for us because it's really an important part of our
*26:48.740- 26:54.240* :  business. Just this morning Kiev was under heavy shell and yet we continue to push forward,
*26:54.340- 26:59.860* :  and I'm proud to be a part of Ukraine in fashion weeks, returned to Kiev, it's a powerful
*26:59.860- 27:05.680* :  statement that despite the hardships we continue to create and stay rooted in our culture.
*27:06.280- 27:12.600* :  We want to highlight that Ukraine is a home of talented, creative people who can produce something
*27:12.600- 27:17.840* :  truly unique and valuable, no matter of the dark times in Ukraine.
*27:18.740- 27:24.020* :  Julia, you say it's an important symbol, but is anyone in Ukraine what with their being a war on
*27:24.100- 27:30.640* :  thinking much about fashion? I mean are people buying things? Of course people buy and we have to
*27:30.640- 27:38.700* :  live from day to day, we have shows that they tuned in this world, no matter way, no matter the
*27:38.700- 27:46.640* :  circumstances, we have to show our culture to the whole world and mission of designers to light
*27:46.680- 27:53.220* :  this process. Yeah, I think that a lot of our clients right now just live every day like
*27:53.220- 27:59.420* :  they are last day, and they really want to celebrate their birthday, their special events,
*27:59.420- 28:06.120* :  like super events, really, that's why they buy a lot of clothes, they understand that you never
*28:06.120- 28:10.860* :  know what will be tomorrow. Just finally, but maybe a slightly strange question, Julie, it has the war
*28:10.860- 28:15.420* :  actually influenced what is fashionable, what what people are wearing. Of course, so many people
*28:15.420- 28:20.640* :  are involved in the armed forces now, we keep seeing Vladimir Zelensky, the president on TV wearing
*28:20.640- 28:26.220* :  the same sort of dark green t-shirt with the cargo pants, I mean it has had an influence on
*28:26.220- 28:34.820* :  Ukrainian fashion. I think that first lady, Elena Zelenska, is showing her position in negotiations
*28:34.820- 28:42.680* :  when she wearing a dark green and just Ukrainian designers, it's very important to all of us.
*28:43.020- 28:48.440* :  Ukrainian fashion designers, Julie, Yama, Luyuk and Elvira, guessing over talking to Luke Jones.
*28:49.580- 28:54.020* :  One of the astronauts stranded on the International Space Station has reported a strange noise
*28:54.020- 28:59.660* :  coming from Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Butch will more contact admission controlled in
*28:59.660- 29:05.060* :  Houston to share his concerns, just days before the faulty vehicle is due to undock and attempt
*29:05.060- 29:10.420* :  to return to Earth unmanned. Here's the moment butch relayed the mystery sounds to administrators on
*29:17.100- 29:21.540* :  the ground. All right, butch that one came through, it was kind of like a pulsing noise, almost like
*29:22.440- 29:27.660* :  sonarping. Now I do it one more time and large else criteria to see if things are going on. Here we go.
*29:33.640- 29:38.020* :  Well, the US Space Agency has now released a statement apparently clearing up the mystery,
*29:38.020- 29:42.720* :  former NASA astronaut, Colonel Cady Coleman, spoke to Evan Davis.
*29:43.320- 29:48.260* :  What you're hearing is feedback from the speaker and it's an audio configuration between
*29:48.260- 29:52.920* :  the Space Station and the Starliner and that doesn't surprise me a bit in that you would think,
*29:52.920- 29:57.380* :  you know, a radio we've had them for a long time, but it's a pretty complicated beast up on the
*29:57.380- 30:01.680* :  Space Station and it's connecting the Russian segment, the Japanese segment, the European segment,
*30:02.200- 30:06.300* :  and now the Starliner. I mean, there's still things to learn and apparently this week I know
*30:06.300- 30:11.380* :  the thing was learned. Yeah, I mean, obviously online people had lots of theories. It's an alien
*30:11.380- 30:17.540* :  with a decapitated head outside the craft banging it on the on the side. All of those kinds of
*30:17.540- 30:23.700* :  crazy hot, but tell us about the sound when you're up there. Are there lots of noises or is
*30:23.700- 30:28.780* :  it incredibly quiet on the Space Station? I would never say it's quiet up there and that we have
*30:28.780- 30:34.960* :  a lot of white noise from the fans because we have to circulate the air quite well because we
*30:34.960- 30:40.540* :  need to scrub out the CO2 that we breathe out. So there's a lot of air movement, which is good.
*30:40.860- 30:45.560* :  That means there's a lot of fan noise and they've done their best to minimize that fan noise,
*30:45.560- 30:50.660* :  but it's still very much from white noise. But I think as folks that live up there, I mean,
*30:50.880- 30:54.380* :  Space Flight is still, we're always learning things and every time you notice something that's
*30:54.380- 30:59.740* :  unexpected, we report that to the ground so that they can understand that, oh, this mechanism,
*30:59.740- 31:04.620* :  that's always easy to operate is suddenly stiff. Or I'm hearing this thing, you know, when you go
*31:04.620- 31:08.560* :  to the mechanic and you say, you know, my car is making this sound. And I thought it was really great
*31:08.560- 31:13.100* :  that they could actually play the sound for mission control. And so it's kind of our job to notice
*31:13.100- 31:16.820* :  those things. We're at the edge, you know, the dozen people that are up in space right now are
*31:16.820- 31:21.680* :  the furthest away from Earth and their job is to notice stuff for all of us. For my astronaut,
*31:21.680- 31:29.100* :  Cady Coleman. And that's all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*31:29.100- 31:33.160* :  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and produced by Richard Halton, our editors,
*31:33.160- 31:36.220* :  Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
*31:44.620- 31:49.360* :  I'm Sumi Somaskanda from the Global Story podcast where we're looking at the problems facing Boeing
*31:49.840- 31:55.040* :  after failures of its Starliner spacecraft have left two astronauts stranded in space.
*31:55.780- 32:00.400* :  They were supposed to be on the International Space Station for eight days, but will now be
*32:00.400- 32:06.000* :  there for at least eight months. This is the latest in a long line of crises facing the company.
*32:06.760- 32:11.940* :  So is this one failure too far for Boeing? Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
