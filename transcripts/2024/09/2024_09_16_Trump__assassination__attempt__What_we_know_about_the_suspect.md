*01:26.120- 01:32.820* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 13 hours GMT on Monday, the 16th of September, these are our main
*01:32.820- 01:33.320* :  stories.
*01:33.320- 01:38.720* :  We get the latest on the man suspected of trying to assassinate Donald Trump.
*01:39.220- 01:44.940* :  Germany reintroduces controls on all external borders, an American pastor held in a Chinese
*01:44.940- 01:47.560* :  jail for 18 years is finally home.
*01:47.840- 01:50.480* :  And the UN speaks out on Gaza.
*01:53.440- 01:58.560* :  Also in this podcast, the male officer told me to take off my coat and lay down on the
*01:58.560- 01:58.780* :  bed.
*01:59.040- 02:04.960* :  He was holding a black leather whip in one hand, rare testimony from women in Iran who say
*02:04.960- 02:08.200* :  they've been persecuted because of social media activity.
*02:11.880- 02:16.540* :  New concerns have been raised in the United States about the safety of presidential candidates
*02:16.540- 02:21.280* :  after an apparent second attempt in two months on the life of Donald Trump.
*02:21.280- 02:26.320* :  The former president was unharmed when shots were fired at a Florida golf course where he
*02:26.320- 02:27.340* :  was playing on Sunday.
*02:27.340- 02:31.960* :  A suspect named by US media as Ryan Routh was later arrested.
*02:32.420- 02:34.600* :  He's expected to appear in court later.
*02:35.000- 02:39.600* :  The Republican governor of Florida, Ron de Santis, said people deserved the truth about
*02:39.600- 02:45.620* :  how a would-be assassin was able to get within 500 yards, 400 meters of Mr. Trump.
*02:45.840- 02:50.900* :  The security has been tightened around the former president after the shooting in Pennsylvania
*02:50.900- 02:53.740* :  in July in which he suffered a wound to his ear.
*02:54.020- 02:58.840* :  A correspondent Tom Bateman is in Florida at the West Palm Beach Course.
*02:59.500- 03:04.020* :  Where I'm standing now, which is on the perimeter on the edge of the Trump International Golf
*03:04.020- 03:04.220* :  Club.
*03:04.600- 03:07.220* :  That's his private golf club here in West Palm Beach.
*03:07.680- 03:13.240* :  The former president was moving from the fifth to the sixth hole and there was an advanced
*03:13.280- 03:19.700* :  detail of Secret Service agents who were sweeping the area that he was about to head into.
*03:20.260- 03:25.500* :  When they spotted what they described as the barrel of a rifle pointing through a chainling
*03:25.500- 03:31.080* :  fence in the bushes here, and that's when they say they engaged this suspect.
*03:31.080- 03:33.980* :  They fired the man hiding in the bushes.
*03:33.980- 03:38.200* :  He then fled, got into a black Nissan and drove off.
*03:38.820- 03:45.380* :  Since then, they have detained a suspect that they identify as the same person who fled
*03:45.380- 03:46.040* :  this scene.
*03:46.040- 03:52.300* :  He's now now being held in the county jail, essentially ahead of a court appearance this morning.
*03:53.240- 03:59.240* :  What is unclear at the moment is still whether or not this man fired at the Secret Service
*03:59.240- 04:00.940* :  agents or at Donald Trump himself.
*04:01.000- 04:03.340* :  We don't have that confirmed yet.
*04:03.580- 04:06.860* :  They were asked that question directly in the news conference and all they've said about
*04:06.860- 04:11.360* :  that is they know that their Secret Service agents shot at the suspect whether or not
*04:11.360- 04:16.820* :  he shot towards them or towards the former president is still a focus of their investigation.
*04:17.180- 04:21.340* :  This obviously raises more questions about the former president's security.
*04:22.220- 04:28.040* :  It does because remember, it's just over two months since Donald Trump was the subject
*04:28.040- 04:32.220* :  of a first attempt at assassination at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
*04:32.360- 04:38.120* :  That precipitated the resignation of the director of the Secret Service over failures
*04:38.120- 04:41.200* :  to protect him effectively in that incident.
*04:41.900- 04:46.240* :  Here we are yet again with a second apparent attempt here.
*04:46.260- 04:51.420* :  I think there's a couple of things to say about the way this is being looked at here.
*04:52.180- 04:58.680* :  It is certainly clear that the fact they spotted this gun in the bushes potentially saved
*04:58.680- 04:59.880* :  Donald Trump's life.
*05:00.520- 05:04.540* :  There will be a lot of tribute and there has been tributes over that fact, but the wider
*05:04.540- 05:07.600* :  issue is about securing the perimeter of the golf course.
*05:07.900- 05:11.640* :  It's long been a concern of the Secret Service and other law enforcement officials about
*05:11.640- 05:14.540* :  his vulnerability when he plays golf.
*05:15.000- 05:21.200* :  Sometimes there are members of the public on these golf courses in very close vicinity when
*05:21.240- 05:25.740* :  he is playing and there seems to have been a bit of a patchwork approach to how they're
*05:26.400- 05:26.560* :  protected.
*05:26.560- 05:31.820* :  Tom Baseman, Ryan Routh's social media profile suggests that he's been involved in efforts
*05:31.820- 05:33.960* :  to get foreign fighters into Ukraine.
*05:34.080- 05:37.120* :  This was him speaking in June 2022.
*05:37.780- 05:40.800* :  These flags represent the civilians that are here fighting.
*05:41.160- 05:45.480* :  It doesn't represent the governments, but we are keeping an account of all the civilians
*05:45.480- 05:48.420* :  that are here fighting that have come from their own countries.
*05:48.780- 05:49.700* :  They've sold everything.
*05:49.700- 05:50.440* :  They've owned.
*05:50.780- 05:51.940* :  They've sold their vehicles.
*05:51.940- 05:52.500* :  They're tired.
*05:53.740- 05:56.640* :  Everything to come here and support Ukrainians.
*05:57.060- 06:03.540* :  So it is truly heroic what these kids and adults have done as far as getting here on
*06:03.540- 06:07.460* :  their own dime and spending their own money to come here and fight with the Ukrainians.
*06:08.000- 06:13.960* :  Mr Routh was speaking there to a French freelance journalist, EM Pita, who's based in Kiev.
*06:14.460- 06:19.420* :  He told my colleague, Cassia Madera, how he'd come across Mr Routh in the Ukrainian capital
*06:19.420- 06:20.180* :  two years ago.
*06:20.660- 06:26.620* :  I was talking with some passbys, and I think he hover heard me mentioning that I was a journalist.
*06:27.200- 06:32.700* :  So he asked me straight up if I could record his message or his appeal to the world, if
*06:32.700- 06:32.980* :  you will.
*06:33.440- 06:40.060* :  So I didn't see much interest in it as a story in the sense that it was just a lone volunteer
*06:40.800- 06:45.660* :  sitting in the middle of the capital, already six months, well, four months into the
*06:45.660- 06:46.360* :  full-scale invasion.
*06:47.540- 06:51.160* :  But I thought I would be doing in a favor because the man was already kind of, as you can
*06:51.160- 06:57.820* :  say, seen the video theory arts in very emotional, seen as far as I could tell, well-meaning,
*06:57.820- 07:02.180* :  well-intentioned, a bit cookie, some might say, but well-meaning.
*07:02.180- 07:05.240* :  So we kind of sat down and introduced himself.
*07:05.240- 07:09.600* :  So he said he was from Hawaii that he had sold most of his possessions to come to Ukraine,
*07:10.640- 07:15.360* :  that he was refused entry into the international legion of Ukraine into five because he was considered
*07:15.360- 07:20.680* :  to all, he told me that he was, I think, in his late 50s at the time, and introduced himself
*07:20.680- 07:26.140* :  as a recruiter for the international legions and whatever, and then he went into this kind
*07:26.140- 07:30.680* :  of rent about how the world is not doing enough about how countries are not doing enough
*07:30.680- 07:31.400* :  to help Ukraine.
*07:31.860- 07:34.560* :  And generally seemed very, very emotional.
*07:34.560- 07:39.120* :  He mentioned his own personal situation a number of times, meaning, as I said, that he
*07:39.120- 07:42.580* :  had sold most of his possessions, that he had traveled halfway across the world to
*07:42.580- 07:46.360* :  come to Ukraine, and that basically we were not doing enough to help the country that
*07:46.360- 07:49.580* :  was being invaded, and that is still being invaded by Russia.
*07:50.260- 07:51.780* :  Guim, this is extraordinary.
*07:51.780- 07:57.120* :  We have to obviously be careful because this man has now been arrested.
*07:57.120- 08:02.820* :  He's a suspect in this apparent assassination attempt of the former President Donald Trump.
*08:02.820- 08:09.460* :  But when you realized that this was the man who you spoke to just a couple of years ago,
*08:09.980- 08:10.880* :  what was your reaction?
*08:11.320- 08:15.440* :  I basically woke up this morning to the phone, pinging constantly with notifications,
*08:15.540- 08:21.360* :  mostly from ex-fomely-known as Switzerland, because some people found that video that I had
*08:21.360- 08:23.460* :  posted on social media back in the days.
*08:23.640- 08:27.340* :  As far as I can recall, it was a call for a two-action, not so much for the governments,
*08:27.920- 08:32.400* :  but to the people that people should take matters into their own hands, basically, you know,
*08:32.400- 08:37.200* :  come over to Ukraine and fight, meaning that people should get off their couch, take up a rifle,
*08:37.500- 08:38.740* :  and go fight individually.
*08:39.120- 08:40.620* :  Journalist G.M.P. Tag.
*08:41.540- 08:46.400* :  To Germany now, where authorities have reintroduced border checks at all nine of the country's
*08:46.400- 08:51.660* :  land borders, in a move that has drawn criticism from several European partners, critics
*08:51.660- 08:56.460* :  describe the move as a panic to response to the electoral rise of the far right party,
*08:56.460- 08:57.340* :  the AFD.
*08:57.660- 09:02.740* :  The spokesman for the Federal Police, Dieter Hut, said he did not expect there would be
*09:02.740- 09:04.240* :  many delays for motorists.
*09:04.660- 09:13.220* :  Our controls are very flexible and dependent on the situation, which means we're not setting
*09:13.220- 09:18.740* :  up the classic border post, and we do not check every vehicle or every person.
*09:19.440- 09:24.820* :  Rather, the checks are targeted at vehicles where we suspect illegal migration.
*09:25.620- 09:32.100* :  By doing so, we want to keep the inconvenience for commuters and the transfer of goods to
*09:32.100- 09:32.640* :  a minimum.
*09:33.280- 09:37.760* :  I asked our Berlin correspondent, Jessica Parker, what exactly the German government
*09:37.760- 09:38.640* :  have done and why?
*09:39.100- 09:46.420* :  They already had border controls in place on their eastern and southern borders, so alongside
*09:46.420- 09:52.920* :  countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria as well, particularly routes that have
*09:52.920- 09:56.400* :  been well known for being used as migrant crossing points.
*09:56.720- 10:01.260* :  What they've now done is extend these border controls, which are essentially spot checks.
*10:01.300- 10:06.040* :  We're not talking about a hard border here, to all of their borders, including in the
*10:06.040- 10:12.420* :  north, with Denmark, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, so as you say, all of their
*10:12.420- 10:16.880* :  land borders now, initial reports that we've seen so far this morning suggest traffic
*10:16.880- 10:21.140* :  is flowing fairly freely, and look, I've seen those border controls in operation where
*10:21.140- 10:24.920* :  they were already in place in the south and the east, I mean, they're very varied to
*10:24.920- 10:30.600* :  absolutely no kind of control on quiet country roads whatsoever visible, at least, to
*10:30.600- 10:36.620* :  busier highways I saw from Poland, where lorries and trucks, basically vehicles where potentially
*10:36.620- 10:40.560* :  people might be hidden, or they'll be the capacity to hide people within them were being pulled
*10:40.580- 10:41.540* :  over and checked.
*10:41.640- 10:45.300* :  So I think it'll be quite varied, it's really not something where you're going to see every
*10:45.300- 10:50.600* :  vehicle flagged over every person's paperwork checked, but there is some political signalling
*10:50.980- 10:54.760* :  here going on as well, even though the practicalities by some are being questioned.
*10:55.120- 11:00.920* :  But the whole point of the Schengen border free area in Europe is that there aren't any
*11:00.920- 11:01.280* :  borders.
*11:01.580- 11:05.740* :  Yeah, and some people are accusing Germany of undermining this.
*11:06.000- 11:09.160* :  That being said, they're not the first country to do something like this.
*11:09.160- 11:11.180* :  These controls, they have to be temporary.
*11:11.180- 11:16.940* :  That's the kind of rule here that if you want to apply in essentially an extraordinary
*11:17.680- 11:21.080* :  situation, some kind of border control, at the moment these are only supposed to last
*11:21.080- 11:24.040* :  for six months, so that they can then get rolled over.
*11:24.360- 11:28.100* :  They have been used in other countries, for example, if there's a major sporting event
*11:28.100- 11:30.740* :  or a security concern of some description.
*11:31.200- 11:34.500* :  So Germany isn't necessarily breaking you ground, except for the fact they are doing
*11:34.500- 11:35.740* :  it on all their borders.
*11:35.740- 11:41.300* :  And of course, as well, Germany, the largest EU economy, often seen as the engine for
*11:41.300- 11:45.900* :  economic growth in Europe, although their economy is fairly flatlining at the moment.
*11:45.900- 11:52.840* :  And I think some are accusing them of doing this to pander to what we're seeing, in terms
*11:52.840- 11:56.700* :  of you mentioned it before, the success of the far right alternative for Deutschland,
*11:56.720- 12:00.940* :  which immigration is their kind of signature issue, and they've done very well into recent
*12:00.940- 12:05.040* :  regional elections and could do well in another regional election this coming Sunday.
*12:05.460- 12:06.860* :  Jessica Parker, in Berlin.
*12:07.720- 12:12.560* :  The Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, has declared a state of natural disaster as floodwaters
*12:12.560- 12:17.460* :  in and date parts of the country, forcing thousands from their homes, at least four people
*12:17.460- 12:19.640* :  have died on the Polish Czech border.
*12:20.120- 12:24.420* :  Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford is there, and I asked her what the situation
*12:24.420- 12:25.280* :  was like now.
*12:25.780- 12:29.060* :  There's, I guess, a little bit of good news this morning here in Istanbul, because the
*12:29.060- 12:34.940* :  reins have stopped, and it does seem like in the main river that's been raging right
*12:34.940- 12:37.960* :  through the centre of this town, the water levels have dropped a little bit.
*12:37.960- 12:42.880* :  The reservoir, too, the level has gone down slightly, because the fear overnight was
*12:42.880- 12:47.940* :  that there's a dam that's burst up river from here, and everyone locally had been told
*12:47.940- 12:51.560* :  to expect a wave of water heading towards this town.
*12:52.120- 12:56.600* :  That didn't happen overnight, so people are breathing huge size of relief, because there's
*12:56.600- 13:00.420* :  a lot of people here who've been extremely worried about their homes, about their businesses.
*13:00.860- 13:05.440* :  Yesterday, we saw really dramatic scenes later at night as the military rolled in to one
*13:05.440- 13:12.200* :  area of town, where a road looked exactly like a huge and very fast-moving river, and
*13:12.200- 13:16.620* :  in the middle of all of that water, there was a fire truck that had got trapped and a military
*13:16.620- 13:22.420* :  truck, too, so pretty dramatic scenes throughout the day yesterday, as I say, things slightly
*13:22.420- 13:26.400* :  calmer today, but still people are very nervous about what might yet be to come here.
*13:26.560- 13:29.640* :  Donald Tusk has declared a state of natural disaster.
*13:29.640- 13:30.960* :  What does that mean in practice?
*13:31.320- 13:36.400* :  In practice, that means that there's recourse to funding and to assistance from the EU.
*13:36.660- 13:41.960* :  It means that Poland can call on the EU for help with logistics, for help, with transport
*13:41.960- 13:46.080* :  potentially with more helicopters, if they need it, and more vehicles to help evacuate
*13:46.080- 13:48.820* :  people into help with the rescue and the recovery, essentially.
*13:48.860- 13:53.300* :  It also gives the government a little bit more power if they need to control population
*13:53.420- 13:56.800* :  movements if they need to order people to evacuate or if they need to implement some
*13:56.800- 13:58.340* :  kind of curfew or anything like that.
*13:58.440- 14:01.000* :  And Sarah, that's the thing, isn't it, because it's not just that area.
*14:01.000- 14:04.780* :  This is over a large part of Central and Eastern Europe.
*14:05.060- 14:07.240* :  Yeah, Romania very, very badly affected.
*14:07.240- 14:08.880* :  Several people killed there.
*14:09.240- 14:13.200* :  We now know four people have lost their lives in Poland, in the Czech Republic.
*14:13.200- 14:17.260* :  At the last count, I think, at least four people have been swept away by the waters.
*14:17.280- 14:22.640* :  And remember that a lot of people in this region think back to 1997, the moment that
*14:22.640- 14:25.820* :  was called the Millennium Flood, the Great Floods of 1997.
*14:25.880- 14:29.360* :  In those floods, more than a hundred people were killed.
*14:29.780- 14:33.680* :  And lots of people are pointing out now that people locally and the authorities locally
*14:33.680- 14:34.980* :  are much better prepared.
*14:34.980- 14:37.020* :  They have more floodgates in place.
*14:37.020- 14:39.940* :  They know better how to deal with this kind of emergencies.
*14:40.780- 14:47.160* :  Sarah Reinsford, now to what could be one of the biggest financial scandals ever to
*14:47.160- 14:47.960* :  engulf football.
*14:48.160- 14:53.900* :  The hearing into Manchester City's 115 charges for alleged breaches of the English
*14:53.900- 14:59.160* :  Premier League's financial rules have started, just in web spoke to the BBC's sports editor
*14:59.160- 14:59.960* :  Dan Rowan.
*15:00.340- 15:07.280* :  These 115 charges relate to the 14 seasons after City's Abu Dhabi takeover back in 2008,
*15:07.280- 15:10.440* :  which of course transformed into one of the richest clubs in the world.
*15:11.000- 15:15.980* :  This was a period, these 14 seasons in which they achieved unprecedented domination of
*15:15.980- 15:17.700* :  the English game, winning several titles.
*15:18.220- 15:23.300* :  And in effect, they are accused of subverting financial rules that limit club spending
*15:24.020- 15:24.560* :  on players.
*15:24.560- 15:30.360* :  In effect, cheating, the regulations, they include 54 counts of failing to provide accurate
*15:30.360- 15:35.400* :  financial information over nine seasons, 14 of not providing full details for manager
*15:35.920- 15:41.500* :  and player payments, several counts of failing to comply with both UEFA and Premier League
*15:41.500- 15:41.820* :  rules.
*15:42.340- 15:47.460* :  And then also 35 counts of failure to cooperate with an investigation that was conducted
*15:47.460- 15:48.240* :  over four years.
*15:48.560- 15:54.140* :  The most serious charges relate to an allegation that City effectively inflated commercial
*15:54.200- 16:00.140* :  revenue, just in by disguising direct investment from the club's Abu Dhabi owners as sponsorship
*16:00.580- 16:00.720* :  income.
*16:01.060- 16:05.000* :  But it's important to stress, the club denies all charges and say they have a body of
*16:05.020- 16:07.460* :  irrefutable evidence that will, they say, clear them.
*16:07.580- 16:08.820* :  Who actually makes the decision?
*16:09.580- 16:12.840* :  Well, this is a Premier League arbitration disciplinary process.
*16:12.840- 16:17.660* :  So it's a three person panel that's expected to last around 10 weeks.
*16:17.660- 16:22.300* :  It starts today at a location that hasn't been disclosed in central London.
*16:22.300- 16:22.580* :  Really?
*16:23.080- 16:24.500* :  Well, it's at a secret location.
*16:24.800- 16:25.760* :  This is not held in public.
*16:25.760- 16:31.020* :  This is an internal disciplinary process expected to last more than two months, and then
*16:31.020- 16:33.840* :  they'll be considerable amount of time potentially of deliberation.
*16:33.840- 16:38.400* :  So it may not be until next year, but this has been rumbling on now, since 2018, would
*16:38.400- 16:43.240* :  you believe, when allegations first came to light, the Premier League set up an investigation
*16:43.920- 16:47.800* :  around that time and they were charged, in fact, city back in February of 2023.
*16:47.860- 16:49.000* :  So this has been rumbling on.
*16:49.000- 16:51.020* :  This has become a huge saga for the league.
*16:51.080- 16:56.620* :  And is it right that ultimately it could require them to be relegated, which would be an
*16:56.620- 17:02.700* :  extraordinary kind of world story when unprecedented and seismic for a club that enjoys such domination.
*17:03.480- 17:06.940* :  If they were found guilty of the most serious charges, I think, you know, city would risk
*17:06.940- 17:10.840* :  being forever associated with one of the biggest financial scandals that sports
*17:10.840- 17:11.160* :  have seen.
*17:11.740- 17:15.440* :  And they could, yes, in theory, face a points deduction serious enough to condemn them
*17:15.440- 17:18.820* :  to relegation or even expulsion from the Premier League.
*17:18.820- 17:23.060* :  Now such a fate would cast a long shadow, wouldn't it, over city's achievements, he could
*17:23.060- 17:28.140* :  even spark claims for compensation, for a case that's been billed as sports trial of
*17:28.140- 17:28.640* :  the century.
*17:28.640- 17:33.020* :  Today, certainly marks the finding stage in a legal dispute, the like of which English
*17:33.020- 17:33.980* :  football has never seen.
*17:33.980- 17:37.160* :  And as well as the club, there's a huge amount of stake for the Premier League as well
*17:37.160- 17:39.620* :  at a time of various regulatory challenges.
*17:46.680- 17:50.820* :  I've tried so many times to put into words what we're working on, baby, baby, and to me
*17:50.820- 17:53.880* :  and I fail every time, so I'm going to sing, no.
*17:56.560- 18:02.560* :  The mega hits and misses for this year's Emmy Awards celebrating the best in television.
*18:11.140- 18:16.360* :  Deep in the ocean, an orca pod is on the hunt, but these aren't your average orcas.
*18:17.160- 18:18.700* :  These guys are organized.
*18:29.660- 18:33.880* :  They use Monday.com to keep their teamwork sharp, their communication clear, and their goals
*18:33.880- 18:40.380* :  in sight, Monday.com, for whatever you run, even orcas, go to Monday.com to dive deeper.
*18:41.140- 18:44.200* :  Ryan Reynolds here for, I guess, my hundredth mint commercial.
*18:44.740- 18:48.940* :  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, honestly, when I started this, I thought I
*18:48.940- 18:50.120* :  only had to do like four of these.
*18:50.300- 18:53.620* :  I mean, it's unlimited premium wireless for $15 a month.
*18:53.720- 18:56.640* :  How are there still people paying two or three times that much?
*18:57.240- 18:58.720* :  I'm sorry, I shouldn't be victim blaming here.
*18:58.760- 19:03.160* :  Give it a try at midmobile.com slash switch, whatever you're ready.
*19:03.480- 19:07.640* :  $45 up from payment equivalent to $15 per month, new customers on first three month plan
*19:07.640- 19:10.840* :  only, taxes and fees extra, speed slower above 40 gigabyte, the CT tails.
*19:16.240- 19:21.920* :  The UN's most senior official overseeing aid and reconstruction in Gaza has said the
*19:21.920- 19:24.900* :  international community is failing innocent civilians.
*19:25.400- 19:31.340* :  Speaking to the BBC from New York, Sigrid Cagg, the senior UN coordinator for humanitarian
*19:31.340- 19:37.340* :  action and reconstruction in Gaza, describe the territory as the most unsafe place in the
*19:37.340- 19:38.080* :  world to work.
*19:38.400- 19:43.300* :  Ms. Cagg was speaking in a rare interview with our chief international correspondent, Least
*19:43.300- 19:43.620* :  who said,
*19:44.280- 19:52.140* :  My main message is of a very somber and perhaps dark nature that you may turn conditions in
*19:52.140- 19:58.820* :  Gaza as well documented and reported are akin to a significant catastrophe that we've built
*19:58.820- 20:04.780* :  all systems to be in place, but there's no substitute for political will and the political
*20:04.780- 20:06.880* :  choice to improve matters.
*20:07.340- 20:11.160* :  The ceasefire and release of the hostages is desperately needed.
*20:11.600- 20:15.040* :  Not much else can be improved until we reach that point.
*20:15.700- 20:18.180* :  Is the UN failing the people of Gaza?
*20:18.560- 20:20.300* :  It's too easy to say we're failing.
*20:20.700- 20:25.360* :  What we are doing collectively, I would say, is an international community, is we are failing
*20:25.360- 20:29.860* :  the innocent civilians in Gaza and that comes out of the political environment.
*20:30.300- 20:32.420* :  The UN is working around the clock.
*20:32.940- 20:38.260* :  The so-called enabling environment in Gaza is actually counter to anything else we've
*20:38.260- 20:39.760* :  witnessed on other places.
*20:40.380- 20:41.660* :  It's highly unsafe.
*20:42.340- 20:45.060* :  So let's look at the political environment.
*20:46.020- 20:51.120* :  For example, the British foreign secretary David Lamy said he has repeatedly enforcefully
*20:51.120- 20:53.960* :  raised his concerns with Israeli officials.
*20:54.440- 20:57.880* :  He said regrettably they have not been addressed satisfactorily.
*20:58.120- 21:00.460* :  Have your concerns been addressed satisfactorily?
*21:00.460- 21:03.180* :  My mission has constructive discussions.
*21:03.220- 21:05.960* :  We put asks on the table some of them are met.
*21:06.420- 21:13.320* :  We also obtain commitments but between the commitment and the time that it takes to actually
*21:13.320- 21:18.140* :  seek and see visible and tangible implementation too much time passes.
*21:18.440- 21:20.880* :  There is not a day, not a second to lose.
*21:21.540- 21:25.300* :  But it's month after month, as you know, it's just getting worse.
*21:25.840- 21:27.780* :  So your mandate is failing.
*21:28.280- 21:33.340* :  The only metric that matters is change in the well-being in the conditions of people on
*21:33.340- 21:33.720* :  the ground.
*21:33.980- 21:36.900* :  But that is getting worse, the well-being of the people of Gaza.
*21:37.320- 21:40.800* :  We can't say that aid hasn't gotten in, but it's insufficient.
*21:40.960- 21:46.740* :  It is not broad enough in the scope of good people need, but in nowhere does it meet the
*21:46.980- 21:48.180* :  totality of needs.
*21:48.180- 21:50.460* :  And these needs are an expression of rights.
*21:51.160- 21:56.280* :  Israeli officials tell us that one of the main reasons for the aid shortage is that Hamas
*21:56.700- 22:01.340* :  is stealing the aid, which means the United Nations is not controlling it.
*22:01.600- 22:02.260* :  Is that the issue?
*22:02.800- 22:03.640* :  We hear that a lot.
*22:03.640- 22:06.460* :  I find that very difficult to confirm.
*22:06.460- 22:11.700* :  I know that our colleagues, the different UN organizations, are working, they're distributing,
*22:11.840- 22:17.460* :  they're monitoring, they're securing the assistance and through their operations and
*22:17.460- 22:19.720* :  partners and actually making sure it reaches people.
*22:20.220- 22:23.420* :  I can't say that everything goes right all the time.
*22:23.420- 22:24.600* :  This is a war zone.
*22:24.940- 22:31.180* :  You are one of the few senior UN officials who meets senior Israeli officials, including
*22:31.180- 22:33.220* :  Prime Minister Netanyahu.
*22:34.000- 22:37.660* :  How does he explain to you why more trucks are not going in?
*22:37.660- 22:41.760* :  Why Gaza is on the brink of famine if not already in famine?
*22:42.160- 22:47.120* :  I don't have the habit to comment publicly on what I discuss in closed-door meetings,
*22:47.640- 22:52.120* :  but what is important is that we are very clear on our asks and our observations.
*22:52.480- 22:58.020* :  These are serious discussions, and we continue to press on the follow-up.
*22:58.500- 23:01.540* :  The UN's secret carg talking to least who said.
*23:02.680- 23:07.900* :  After serving nearly 20 years of a life sentence in a Chinese prison, a US pastor is back
*23:07.900- 23:11.060* :  home with his family in Texas following his release.
*23:11.240- 23:16.860* :  David Lin was jailed in 2006, a decision which was criticized by the American government.
*23:17.340- 23:21.760* :  The development comes a few weeks after the US national security adviser Jake Sullivan
*23:22.140- 23:24.680* :  was in Beijing trying to secure Mr. Lin's freedom.
*23:25.140- 23:30.220* :  He's been calling on Beijing to free two other Americans serving jail time in China.
*23:30.660- 23:33.860* :  I spoke to our Asia Pacific editor, Mickey Bristo earlier.
*23:34.140- 23:38.460* :  Well, David Lin was born in China, but is a naturalized US citizen.
*23:38.460- 23:42.780* :  He wasn't actually a Christian when he first went to the United States, but became one,
*23:42.860- 23:47.160* :  and then decided that his role in life was to be a missionary back home in the place of
*23:47.160- 23:47.920* :  his birth, China.
*23:47.920- 23:51.560* :  So from the 1990s, he increasingly went there on this kind of work.
*23:51.560- 23:58.340* :  In 2006, he was detained, and eventually he was charged with contract fraud, essentially
*23:58.340- 23:59.000* :  what he was doing.
*23:59.000- 24:04.320* :  He was trying to help an underground unofficial church in Beijing to build a meeting hall.
*24:04.440- 24:07.940* :  That's why he was charged a sentence to life in prison.
*24:08.220- 24:12.220* :  Essentially, that's where he's been since, for a brief period, or for actually the first
*24:12.220- 24:16.020* :  decade of his time in prison, he asked his family not to campaign for his release.
*24:16.100- 24:20.460* :  He took his time in prison and thought he could take part in missionary work.
*24:20.620- 24:25.820* :  But about six years ago, he appears to have changed his mind as his family to campaign
*24:25.820- 24:26.460* :  for his release.
*24:26.480- 24:30.820* :  They did that, and now he's been released and flown home to his family in Texas.
*24:31.160- 24:33.420* :  And why did China choose to free him now?
*24:33.660- 24:37.640* :  It's a difficult question to answer, because China hasn't officially said they've reduced
*24:37.640- 24:41.520* :  his sentence a couple of times in the subsequent years.
*24:41.540- 24:46.540* :  It was due to be released at the end of this decade, but surely something to do with a pressure
*24:46.540- 24:52.840* :  put on China by the United States to release a prisoner they believed had been incarcerated
*24:52.840- 24:54.740* :  because of spurious charges.
*24:54.980- 25:00.620* :  Also, the background of this is improving relations between Beijing and Washington.
*25:00.620- 25:04.960* :  Beijing, particularly, wants to make sure it has better relations with American.
*25:04.960- 25:10.220* :  And so releasing an American, it has in prison is a gesture of goodwill towards that.
*25:10.840- 25:11.520* :  Mickey Bristo.
*25:12.460- 25:17.380* :  The BBC has spoken to people in Iran who say they've been unjudi-followed, arrested,
*25:17.380- 25:22.760* :  and punished by the state for speaking out against the Islamic Republic on social media.
*25:23.260- 25:27.260* :  Testaments come two years after the women life freedom protests,
*25:27.260- 25:32.420* :  ignited by the death of Masa Amini, who died in police custody, after she was arrested
*25:32.420- 25:37.180* :  and, according to eyewitnesses, beaten for wearing the mandatory hijab loosely around
*25:37.180- 25:37.660* :  her head.
*25:38.140- 25:44.740* :  BBC trending reporter Reha Kansara has more warning this report includes distressing accounts
*25:44.740- 25:45.400* :  of violence.
*25:45.820- 25:49.160* :  I didn't really care enough to hide who I am or where the photo was taken.
*25:50.080- 25:52.600* :  I wanted to say we exist.
*25:54.700- 26:00.540* :  Last year, Alif was arrested after her social media post was picked up by the Iranian authorities.
*26:01.140- 26:06.840* :  The post, a photo of her with her long black hair flowing freely, was an act of defiance
*26:06.840- 26:10.120* :  in a country where the hijab is required by law.
*26:10.840- 26:11.840* :  Why did I do that?
*26:12.360- 26:17.780* :  Because I needed an outlet for all my pent-up emotions to share them with people who
*26:17.780- 26:18.720* :  thought like me.
*26:19.160- 26:24.020* :  Alif, whose name we've changed for security reasons and whose words are spoken by an actor,
*26:24.580- 26:25.720* :  was soon arrested.
*26:26.460- 26:32.060* :  It blindfolded and handcuffed me, put my head on the seat, and when we arrived at the
*26:32.060- 26:34.780* :  location, they put me in a solitary cell overnight.
*26:35.400- 26:37.540* :  The interrogation began the next day.
*26:37.920- 26:42.400* :  They released my hands, and the male officer told me to take off my coat and lay down
*26:42.400- 26:42.900* :  on the bed.
*26:43.960- 26:46.700* :  He was holding a black leather whip in one hand.
*26:47.640- 26:50.520* :  That's when he started hitting me all over my body.
*26:50.520- 26:54.100* :  It was very painful, but I didn't want to show weakness.
*26:54.840- 26:59.500* :  He's one of five Iranians we've spoken to whose court documents reveal that the Iranian
*26:59.500- 27:05.600* :  authorities built cases using their online posts to charge them for propaganda against
*27:05.600- 27:06.260* :  the state.
*27:07.060- 27:09.940* :  Three received suspended sentences like Alif.
*27:10.420- 27:16.640* :  No lashes, but fines and the threat of further tougher retribution looming over them.
*27:17.520- 27:20.480* :  One woman faced prison time and fled the country.
*27:21.460- 27:26.600* :  Tamara Shidi, Director of Internet Security and Digital Rights at the Mian Group, calls
*27:26.600- 27:31.200* :  Iran a surveillance state and says its techniques mimic China's.
*27:31.300- 27:35.640* :  They can jow locate where is your mobile phone, they can see what mobile phone is connected
*27:35.640- 27:41.480* :  to what kind of IT addresses, and then they figured out what's the identity of the people
*27:41.480- 27:43.760* :  who are using that particular mobile phone.
*27:49.620- 27:54.760* :  The ecosystem of surveillance has helped the authorities crush dissent quickly and
*27:55.300- 27:55.360* :  efficiently.
*27:55.980- 28:01.560* :  Since 2009, the government has blocked Western social media apps like Instagram, Twitter
*28:01.560- 28:04.500* :  and Telegram because they cannot control them.
*28:05.180- 28:10.620* :  But Iranians have bypassed the bands using VPNs to disguise their locations and use these
*28:10.660- 28:11.340* :  platforms.
*28:11.720- 28:16.280* :  We contacted the Iranian government and put forward to them all the allegations, contributors
*28:16.280- 28:18.160* :  and experts made to the BBC.
*28:18.860- 28:20.200* :  They did not get back to us.
*28:24.540- 28:28.780* :  Two years on, the death of Masa Amini reverberates across the country.
*28:29.580- 28:34.700* :  Though mass demonstrations have come to a halt, people are protesting in more subtle ways.
*28:35.360- 28:41.080* :  And this movement that's led by women and driven by a right to life and freedom shows
*28:41.080- 28:42.380* :  no signs of stopping.
*28:43.180- 28:45.060* :  It's like seeds of a flower.
*28:45.860- 28:50.980* :  Even if a flower wears or dries out, it seeds for one and flower elsewhere.
*28:51.840- 28:56.440* :  We now speak often in our family and friendship circles about the Women Life Freedom Movement
*28:56.440- 28:58.200* :  and our experience of it.
*29:01.080- 29:03.680* :  BBC trending reporter Reihar Kansara.
*29:04.860- 29:10.580* :  The Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has declared a state of natural disaster as floodwaters
*29:10.820- 29:14.180* :  in and date parts of the country forcing thousands from their homes.
*29:14.660- 29:19.600* :  All countries have been affected at least four people have died on the Polish check border.
*29:19.940- 29:25.140* :  Now, Eastern European correspondent Sarah Reinsford is there, as to what the situation was
*29:25.140- 29:25.740* :  like now.
*29:26.360- 29:29.640* :  There's, I guess, a little bit of good news this morning here in Nisra because the
*29:29.640- 29:35.520* :  rains have stopped and it does seem like in the main river that's been raging right
*29:35.520- 29:38.540* :  through the centre of this town, the water levels have dropped a little bit.
*29:38.540- 29:43.720* :  The reservoir too, the level has gone down slightly because the fear overnight was that
*29:43.740- 29:48.780* :  there's a dam that's burst up river from here and everyone locally had been told to
*29:48.780- 29:52.140* :  expect a wave of water heading towards this town.
*29:52.740- 29:57.220* :  That didn't happen overnight, so people are breathing huge size of relief because there's
*29:57.220- 30:01.020* :  a lot of people here who've been extremely worried about their homes, about their businesses,
*30:01.720- 30:02.540* :  all around the reservoir.
*30:02.540- 30:07.360* :  People have been evacuated and moved to higher ground and this morning we were down by
*30:07.360- 30:11.320* :  the river bank and people were coming down to check out the situation slightly relieved
*30:11.320- 30:16.060* :  as I say, but still nervous because there are reports of still immense water pressure
*30:16.060- 30:21.700* :  on dams and on rivers all over this region and yesterday we saw really dramatic scenes
*30:21.700- 30:27.460* :  later at night as the military rolled in to one area of town where a road, a main road
*30:27.920- 30:33.460* :  looked exactly like a huge and very fast-moving river and in the middle of all of that water
*30:34.000- 30:38.500* :  there was a fire truck that had got trapped and a military truck too that had gone to
*30:38.500- 30:39.200* :  rescue them.
*30:39.260- 30:44.280* :  So pretty dramatic scenes throughout the day yesterday as I say things slightly calmer
*30:44.280- 30:47.700* :  today but still people are very nervous about what might yet be to come here.
*30:47.860- 30:52.280* :  Donald Tusk has declared a state of natural disaster, what does that mean in practice?
*30:52.640- 30:57.720* :  In practice that means that there's recourse to funding and to assistance from the EU.
*30:57.960- 31:03.260* :  It means that Poland can call on the EU for help with logistics, for help with transport
*31:03.260- 31:07.720* :  percent of more helicopters if they need it and more vehicles to help evacuate people
*31:07.720- 31:10.140* :  and to help with the rescue and the recovery essentially.
*31:10.180- 31:14.640* :  It also gives the government a little bit more power if they need to control population
*31:14.660- 31:18.120* :  movements if they need to order people to evacuate or if they need to implement some
*31:18.120- 31:19.660* :  kind of curfew or anything like that.
*31:19.740- 31:23.980* :  And Sarah that's the thing isn't it because it's not just that area, this is over a large
*31:23.980- 31:26.100* :  part of central and eastern Europe.
*31:26.380- 31:30.180* :  Yeah, Romania very, very badly affected, several people killed there.
*31:30.520- 31:34.520* :  We now know four people have lost their lives in Poland in the Czech Republic.
*31:34.520- 31:38.800* :  At the last count I think at least four people have been swept away by the waters.
*31:38.800- 31:44.280* :  And remember that a lot of people in this region think back to 1997, the moment that was
*31:44.280- 31:47.120* :  called the millennium flood, the great floods of 1997.
*31:47.120- 31:52.560* :  Now in those floods more than a hundred people were killed and lots of people are pointing
*31:52.560- 31:56.720* :  out now that people locally and the authorities locally are much better prepared.
*31:56.720- 31:58.820* :  They have more floodgates in place.
*31:58.820- 32:01.740* :  They know better how to deal with this kind of emergencies.
*32:02.480- 32:07.380* :  Sarah Reinsford. The Japanese historical epic Shogun has smashed
*32:07.380- 32:12.980* :  all time records and is named Best Drama at television's Emmy Awards in L.A.
*32:12.980- 32:16.560* :  The first foreign language TV series to win the Best Drama Award.
*32:17.100- 32:22.060* :  Netflix's Baby Rain Deer, a chilling story about a bartender stalked by a customer,
*32:22.680- 32:27.540* :  was named Best Limited Series. L.A. Correspondent Emma Vady was there.
*32:28.160- 32:32.000* :  Thought Baby Rain Deer was going to be a delightful children's story about Rudolf.
*32:33.040- 32:36.420* :  That's Jean Smart, who won Best Actress for her role in Hacks,
*32:36.740- 32:40.160* :  introducing the Emmy nominees for one of the top awards of the night.
*32:40.620- 32:45.140* :  And the Emmy goes to Baby Rain Deer.
*32:46.080- 32:51.900* :  Baby Rain Deer, the show adapted from a one-man play which became a surprise overnight Netflix hit,
*32:51.900- 32:56.660* :  one nearly all of its categories. Richard Gad, the creator of the show,
*32:56.660- 33:00.860* :  said to be his own real-life story about sexual abuse and stalking,
*33:01.240- 33:04.340* :  picked up awards for acting, writing, and Best Drama.
*33:05.040- 33:09.500* :  Look, 10 years ago I was down and out, right? I never ever thought I'd get my life together.
*33:09.940- 33:11.920* :  I never ever thought I'd be able to rectify myself.
*33:11.920- 33:15.500* :  Well, what had happened to me and get myself back on my feet again.
*33:15.500- 33:20.160* :  And then here I am, just over a decade later, picking up one of the biggest writing awards in television, yeah.
*33:20.520- 33:22.240* :  Jessica Gunning, Baby Rain Deer.
*33:24.340- 33:29.080* :  Well, Jessica Gunning, who plays his obsessive stalker, one best supporting actress.
*33:30.220- 33:32.720* :  Oh, my goodness, me. Glinking, heckers.
*33:33.560- 33:34.620* :  Thank you so much.
*33:35.660- 33:37.840* :  I honestly feel like I'm going to wake up any minute now.
*33:37.840- 33:40.420* :  This whole thing has been a dream. Thank you very, very much indeed.
*33:41.080- 33:44.140* :  My biggest thanks, though, has to go to Mr. Richard Gad.
*33:44.140- 33:46.240* :  I don't know. It's the best act right now.
*33:48.080- 33:51.800* :  I've tried so many times to put into words what working on Baby Rain Deer meant to me,
*33:51.800- 33:54.860* :  and I fail every time. So, I'm going to sing, no.
*33:57.800- 33:58.200* :  Very much.
*34:00.040- 34:01.680* :  And the Emmy goes to...
*34:03.200- 34:03.640* :  Shogun.
*34:05.800- 34:08.700* :  The historical drama Shogun made Emmy's history,
*34:08.700- 34:12.360* :  winning 18 awards the most ever in a single season.
*34:12.400- 34:15.980* :  The stars, Anna Sawai, and Hira Yuki Senada,
*34:16.200- 34:19.740* :  became the first Japanese nominees to win best dramatic actors.
*34:21.360- 34:24.760* :  And thank you for all the crew and cast of Shogun.
*34:25.380- 34:26.420* :  I'm so proud of you.
*34:30.400- 34:35.980* :  It was an East meets West dream project with respect.
*34:37.500- 34:43.500* :  And Shogun taught me that when people work together, we can make miracle.
*34:45.360- 34:48.060* :  We can create a better future together.
*34:48.900- 34:49.620* :  Thank you so much.
*34:51.720- 34:55.900* :  And the TV industry has been in a slump with less shows made this year
*34:56.140- 34:57.840* :  and studios reigning in their budgets.
*34:58.560- 35:01.240* :  But with Baby Rain Deer, one of the biggest winners of the night,
*35:01.640- 35:06.020* :  it shows you don't need massive budgets to deliver compelling TV for audiences.
*35:08.440- 35:09.020* :  Emma Vardi.

*36:01.180- 36:06.540* :  but what she does have is a reason to be the bad-ass b**** she was meant to be,
*36:06.780- 36:08.100* :  huh? I can't say b****.
*36:08.340- 36:12.000* :  Okay, she has a reason to be the woman she was meant to be.
