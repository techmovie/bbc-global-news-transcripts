*02:01.780- 02:07.600* :  the latest recruits from Ukraine as they prepare to join the fighting on Russian territory
*02:08.240- 02:12.720* :  and how boys are besieged by violent content and social media.
*02:13.120- 02:16.820* :  I've tried like putting a little not-interested thing, but then three videos later you'll get
*02:16.820- 02:17.260* :  another one.
*02:17.700- 02:21.340* :  It ruins your mood, it makes you a bit numb, it desensitizes you to everything.
*02:25.440- 02:29.960* :  We begin in Israel where a general strike was called by the country's largest union to
*02:29.960- 02:35.020* :  pressurize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing a cease-fire deal after the
*02:35.020- 02:39.100* :  bodies of six hostages were recovered by soldiers in Gaza on Sunday.
*02:39.660- 02:42.640* :  Hundreds of thousands of people have been taking part across the country.
*02:50.000- 02:52.860* :  Businesses were shut down and highways blockaded.
*02:52.860- 02:57.400* :  The Vengarina International Airport in Tel Aviv was operating with reduced staff.
*02:57.920- 02:59.780* :  This was the response of one traveler.
*03:00.220- 03:03.340* :  We planned to go on a wave to Greece for one week holiday.
*03:03.420- 03:08.320* :  Unfortunately our flight has been delayed due to the changes the strike today.
*03:09.280- 03:15.520* :  Having said that, I've participated in the big event last night for the hostages and
*03:15.520- 03:18.760* :  for me the cause justify their impact on me.
*03:19.460- 03:24.540* :  The strike follows a huge protest on Sunday where many accused the Israeli Prime Minister
*03:24.540- 03:28.620* :  and his government of not doing enough to bring hostages home from Gaza.
*03:28.820- 03:31.800* :  It's believed 97 are still being held there.
*03:32.200- 03:36.680* :  The U.S. government has been trying for months to broker a cease-fire between her mass and
*03:36.680- 03:37.020* :  Israel.
*03:37.500- 03:42.040* :  More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict according to the Hamas
*03:42.080- 03:43.140* :  run health authority.
*03:43.760- 03:49.600* :  That followed the Hamas attack on Israel in October in which 1200 Israelis were killed and
*03:49.600- 03:51.700* :  251 were abducted.
*03:52.480- 03:57.620* :  Union leader Peter Lerner told the BBC why he believed the strike in Israel was the right
*03:57.620- 03:58.320* :  course of action.
*03:58.800- 04:05.640* :  The damage to Israel's economy to the workers of Israel, the concerns that we have with
*04:05.640- 04:13.440* :  political influences in the negotiation process and the need for unity, not the vision
*04:13.440- 04:18.860* :  in our society and the requirements to restore the safety and security to people of Israel
*04:19.300- 04:23.560* :  and the internally displaced people here in Israel required a general strike.
*04:24.260- 04:29.260* :  Doctors who cancelled operations too, the Chief of the Surgery Division at Rambam Hospital
*04:29.260- 04:34.700* :  in Haifa, Professor Yuhida Ulman, explained why he and his colleagues decided to walk
*04:34.700- 04:35.060* :  out.
*04:35.420- 04:43.440* :  It's striking, it's a very hard word for physicians who are here to take care for the life and
*04:43.440- 04:46.080* :  the well-being of our patients.
*04:46.820- 04:55.360* :  But we are in a very, very hard situation now, we and all the country because of their
*04:55.360- 05:01.240* :  hostages and yesterday it was maybe the hardest day.
*05:02.080- 05:06.660* :  The Israeli government took legal action to block the strike, which it says is political.
*05:07.280- 05:09.880* :  John Donerson is our correspondent in Jerusalem.
*05:10.360- 05:14.900* :  I spoke to him before the unions agreed to comply with the court order to end the strike
*05:15.240- 05:17.420* :  at 1430 hours local time.
*05:17.980- 05:23.560* :  Thousands of businesses are closed, some schools, universities and government ministries as
*05:23.600- 05:29.920* :  well, banks, some bus networks and a forum representing some hostage families has called
*05:29.920- 05:35.820* :  for more protests today across the country with plans to block some of Israel's busiest
*05:36.000- 05:36.240* :  roads.
*05:36.420- 05:41.520* :  And this comes after last night's protests, which were the biggest scene in Israel since
*05:41.520- 05:46.560* :  the start of the war with hundreds of thousands demonstrating across the country.
*05:47.160- 05:48.760* :  And what do the protesters want?
*05:49.400- 05:54.520* :  Well, the outrage at Hamas is a given, but these protests are not about that.
*05:54.520- 05:59.920* :  The anger is directed at the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is
*05:59.920- 06:06.300* :  accused of blocking a ceasefire and hostage release deal to prioritize his own personal
*06:06.820- 06:08.320* :  political survival.
*06:08.380- 06:13.800* :  So what the protesters want is a ceasefire and hostage release deal.
*06:13.800- 06:19.780* :  Now after the discovery of the bodies of six hostages over the weekend or at the end
*06:19.780- 06:24.800* :  of last week, some families have said their loved ones blood is on the Prime Minister's
*06:24.800- 06:24.980* :  hands.
*06:25.180- 06:30.120* :  And at last night's protests, we had extraordinary scenes really with people chanting murderer
*06:30.580- 06:32.140* :  directed at Mr Netanyahu.
*06:32.140- 06:39.100* :  He of course entirely rejects that he says it is Hamas who is blocking a deal and insists
*06:39.640- 06:42.000* :  he will pursue them and bring them to account.
*06:42.960- 06:50.160* :  So does that mean there is no change in strategy or do you think there is some room for the government
*06:50.160- 06:53.820* :  of Benjamin Netanyahu to exceed to some of the protesters' demands?
*06:54.940- 06:55.980* :  Well, he is in a tight spot.
*06:55.980- 06:58.540* :  There is pressure from the public.
*06:58.540- 07:02.480* :  There is pressure from the opposition parties in Israel.
*07:02.480- 07:08.680* :  There is pressure from the international communities who have been pushing for a comprehensive
*07:08.680- 07:12.960* :  ceasefire and hostage release deal for Gaza for months.
*07:12.960- 07:15.900* :  And there is pressure from within his own government.
*07:15.900- 07:23.060* :  So the Defence Minister, you have glant, has reportedly been in a shouting match with
*07:23.820- 07:30.460* :  Mr Netanyahu in recent days because he also feels that now is the time to do a deal
*07:30.460- 07:34.100* :  and that Mr Netanyahu with his demands is blocking that.
*07:34.100- 07:39.200* :  But he is in a tight spot, the Prime Minister, because also within his government you have
*07:39.200- 07:47.280* :  far-right nationalist ministers who have said they will bring the government down by quitting
*07:47.300- 07:49.780* :  if he goes ahead and does a deal.
*07:50.340- 07:54.540* :  So he is in a difficult position but the pressure is building all the time.
*07:55.540- 08:00.980* :  John Donerson Ukraine has launched widespread drone attacks against targets across the
*08:00.980- 08:02.980* :  Russian border and in the capital Moscow.
*08:03.460- 08:08.060* :  The mayor of Moscow said that at least five drones flying towards the city were destroyed.
*08:08.600- 08:11.880* :  The governor said nearly 40 others were destroyed over several regions.
*08:12.440- 08:14.040* :  Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow.
*08:14.420- 08:20.240* :  According to Russia's Defence Ministry, overnight more than 150 Ukrainian drones targeted
*08:20.960- 08:21.960* :  15 Russian regions.
*08:22.720- 08:26.420* :  The Russian military claimed that the drones were intercepted and destroyed.
*08:27.200- 08:31.660* :  But as a result of the attack, a fire has broken out at an oil refinery in Moscow.
*08:32.320- 08:35.260* :  In a separate technical room, the Moscow mayor said.
*08:36.060- 08:40.580* :  Meanwhile, a hundred miles from the Russian capital, loud blasts were heard close to the
*08:40.700- 08:42.220* :  Konakova power station.
*08:42.700- 08:44.880* :  There were reports of ablaze there too.
*08:45.540- 08:50.060* :  The government in Kiev says it is continuing to seize more Russian land, following its
*08:50.060- 08:51.740* :  surprise incursion a month ago.
*08:52.220- 08:56.240* :  But the biggest military operation into Russia, since the Second World War, has failed
*08:56.240- 09:00.720* :  to ease the huge pressure that Ukraine faces on the eastern home front.
*09:00.740- 09:06.460* :  And given our faces, tough strategic choices about where to commit its troops, our Europe
*09:06.460- 09:10.660* :  correspondent Nick Beek traveled to the Sumi and Cheninev regions near the border with Russia
*09:11.140- 09:15.060* :  to meet the latest Ukrainian recruits as they prepare to join the battle.
*09:18.820- 09:24.660* :  We've joined the Ukrainian military convoy and we're heading towards the Russian border,
*09:25.460- 09:31.020* :  moving along these dusty roads through one village after another that's already been
*09:31.020- 09:33.460* :  scarred from Russian shelling.
*09:34.060- 09:40.240* :  The windows in a lot of places have been blown out, whole houses have been completely obliterated,
*09:40.800- 09:43.120* :  all the civilians have been evacuated from here.
*09:43.660- 09:47.400* :  And we're driving towards a new base that the Ukrainians have set up.
*09:47.600- 09:53.920* :  This was in the aftermath of their lightning quick incursion into Russian territory.
*09:56.760- 10:02.000* :  Your canopy of thick forest, we meet troops who have just returned from Kursk, among them
*10:02.000- 10:07.800* :  a platoon commander from the 22nd mechanized brigade, who goes by the cool sign Storm.
*10:09.540- 10:13.060* :  The Russian soldiers who surrendered, we took as prisoners of war.
*10:13.060- 10:15.260* :  The Russians called attack us, we killed.
*10:15.700- 10:18.900* :  Do you know how long you'll be on Russian territory when you go back?
*10:20.620- 10:24.220* :  We are fulfilling an order, we'll be there as long as we're told to.
*10:24.400- 10:27.380* :  To have an order to move forward, you can get to Moscow.
*10:28.940- 10:34.840* :  It feels that in taking us here, Ukraine is trying to send the message that it's got no
*10:34.840- 10:39.860* :  intention of giving up the Russian land that it gained so quickly, and that in fact it's
*10:39.860- 10:46.040* :  digging in, setting up new bases like this one, and preparing more troops to cross the
*10:46.060- 10:49.000* :  border into Russia, but it's a gamble.
*10:50.940- 10:55.840* :  A gamble because Ukraine is now fighting on yet another front, and the generals need
*10:55.840- 11:02.300* :  to decide where to send the newest army recruits, either inter-Kursk or to defend the battered
*11:02.300- 11:03.860* :  eastern front line at home.
*11:09.060- 11:13.000* :  This is a training camp in the Chernahev region that also borders Russia.
*11:13.540- 11:19.180* :  The military, anxious that the location remains secret, asked us to view the footage we recorded,
*11:19.740- 11:21.440* :  and did not have any editorial control.
*11:22.080- 11:27.200* :  Just looking around at the recruits who are being trained today, and most of them are in
*11:27.200- 11:34.040* :  their 30s, a significant number over 40 and over 50, two and a half years into this war,
*11:34.500- 11:38.740* :  and Ukraine is desperate for troops on the front line.
*11:39.740- 11:43.600* :  For years, Rusty Slav worked as a driver in his home city of Odessa.
*11:44.200- 11:47.960* :  Within weeks, he could be part of Ukraine's operation in Russia.
*11:48.400- 11:53.960* :  I think this is the right thing to do.
*11:54.460- 11:56.300* :  Look, how long they've been on our land.
*11:56.420- 11:59.720* :  You can't just sit there while they're capturing our territory.
*12:00.020- 12:01.360* :  What will we do then?
*12:01.940- 12:06.860* :  Kievoid hoped that Moscow would divert thousands of troops from the east of Ukraine to defend
*12:06.920- 12:07.500* :  Kursk.
*12:07.860- 12:09.720* :  But so far, that hasn't happened.
*12:13.060- 12:19.040* :  Valentin tells us he's had a busy month recovering Ukrainian vehicles recently damaged or destroyed
*12:19.660- 12:20.280* :  inside Russia.
*12:20.880- 12:25.960* :  It's hard to assess the level of casualties that Ukraine has taken in its surprise operation.
*12:26.740- 12:29.980* :  But everyone here, unsurprisingly, is backing the mission.
*12:30.500- 12:35.680* :  Rusty Slav, the new recruit from Odessa, is adamant Ukraine deserves more help.
*12:36.640- 12:39.420* :  We would like to hit Moscow to end this dirty war.
*12:39.920- 12:41.280* :  Children and civilians suffer.
*12:41.620- 12:42.400* :  Everyone does.
*12:43.120- 12:48.540* :  A month after Zelensky's Kursk gamble, the initial morale boost of the incursion has faded
*12:48.940- 12:48.960* :  away.
*12:49.600- 12:55.120* :  A strategic dilemma remains, and none of Ukraine's next moves look simple.
*12:57.260- 12:58.460* :  Nick Beak reporting.
*12:59.400- 13:03.500* :  Finland is planning to stop Russians buying and renting property in the country.
*13:03.500- 13:08.480* :  It also wants to ban others from acting on behalf of Russian citizens and companies in
*13:08.480- 13:09.440* :  such transactions.
*13:09.800- 13:11.480* :  Mr. Piko has the details.
*13:12.080- 13:15.740* :  Over the past decades, Russians have bought more than 3,000 properties in Finland.
*13:16.140- 13:21.460* :  Many are in strategic locations, near-garisons or close to critical infrastructure, like major
*13:21.460- 13:23.020* :  power lines or shipping lanes.
*13:23.680- 13:25.900* :  All of these are obvious targets for sabotage.
*13:26.120- 13:30.040* :  Something Russia has been accused of carrying out in a number of European countries.
*13:30.760- 13:34.700* :  Finland tightened its restrictions on Russia on ownership seven years ago, but the Defence
*13:34.700- 13:38.480* :  Minister and the Hackenon acknowledged that that had not been enough.
*13:38.480- 13:42.300* :  The country had been too naive about the threat Moscow poses.
*13:42.920- 13:46.160* :  Similar concerns have been raised in neighboring Sweden and Norway.
*13:46.960- 13:47.660* :  Risto Piko
*13:48.460- 13:53.860* :  Now to Mexico, worth thousands packed the capital's central square, the Zokalo, for President
*13:53.860- 13:58.240* :  AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez-Obrador's final annual address to the nation.
*13:58.840- 14:03.180* :  Following his marina parties resounding victory in June's elections, the President is leaving
*14:03.180- 14:09.160* :  office in a month, handing power to Claudia Shainbaum, soon to be Mexico's first female
*14:09.160- 14:09.700* :  President.
*14:10.380- 14:14.600* :  Before he goes, Mr. LÃ³pez-Obrador, who's often called Amlo, has promised to push through
*14:14.600- 14:18.060* :  a huge reorganization of the judicial system there.
*14:18.520- 14:23.380* :  He told supporters he stands by his record, as Mexico's defender of democracy.
*14:27.280- 14:32.380* :  We've denounced acts of corruption and influence that prevail in the judiciary.
*14:33.220- 14:40.760* :  That is why we have sent to Congress an initiative for the people to elect judges, magistrates
*14:40.760- 14:48.060* :  and ministers, so that they impart justice for the benefit of all, and are not at the exclusive
*14:48.060- 14:52.180* :  service of organized crime and white collar crime.
*14:52.720- 14:54.880* :  They must serve the people.
*14:55.740- 15:01.100* :  Catarina Schultz is a freelance journalist based in Mexico City, and Gido Daleks Ritzen
*15:01.100- 15:03.280* :  about the controversy behind these reforms.
*15:03.980- 15:09.440* :  At the heart of the reform is a proposal to elect judges by popular vote, and the left
*15:09.440- 15:15.540* :  discovery argues that the judiciary now serves the political and ethnic elite, not the public.
*15:16.060- 15:22.020* :  But detractors say that this plan could dangerously politicize the justice system, and compromise
*15:22.720- 15:22.840* :  independence.
*15:22.860- 15:29.620* :  For the United States, which is Mexico's principal trade partner, they buy 83% of its exports.
*15:30.060- 15:35.740* :  The U.S. Ambassador to Cancelasar said the reform represents a risk for democracy, and it
*15:35.740- 15:39.820* :  could be a threat to the free trade agreement linking the two countries in Canada.
*15:40.160- 15:43.520* :  Is he going to be able to do it in the time that he's got left, or is this something he's
*15:43.520- 15:48.480* :  going to have to hand over to his successor, Claudia Scheinbaum?
*15:49.340- 15:53.800* :  Yeah, this is something that he's going to hand over for Scheinbaum.
*15:54.580- 15:59.640* :  She models pretty much exactly what we've seen in Amos government.
*16:00.140- 16:03.180* :  He endorsed her throughout her entire campaign trail.
*16:03.860- 16:08.660* :  She's taking on most of what he's left behind, and continuing with that.
*16:08.800- 16:15.240* :  So it wouldn't be surprising if, despite the controversy around this, she picks it up
*16:15.280- 16:16.780* :  and continues to run with it.
*16:17.000- 16:20.480* :  What can we expect from her presidency?
*16:20.520- 16:24.280* :  She's taking over a huge majority in parliament.
*16:25.000- 16:31.520* :  Yes, and this is the first time in this century that a Mexican government will have a supermajority
*16:31.520- 16:32.280* :  in Congress.
*16:32.820- 16:35.940* :  She won by a landslide, 60% of the vote.
*16:36.360- 16:40.580* :  And overall, Scheinbaum has made it clear that her government, like I said, will essentially
*16:40.580- 16:42.660* :  model that of Amos government.
*16:43.340- 16:48.160* :  Of course, this time, though, the majority will allow them to modify the constitution without
*16:48.160- 16:50.380* :  needing any opposition votes.
*16:50.920- 16:56.460* :  And the opposition has actually filed suits with Mexico's electoral court, both about the
*16:56.460- 17:00.800* :  presidential elections in June and about the distribution of legislative seats.
*17:01.280- 17:03.400* :  So this is something that we haven't seen before.
*17:03.400- 17:05.200* :  She's also the first woman president.
*17:05.840- 17:10.180* :  And it's going to be really interesting to see how her presidency unravels.
*17:10.560- 17:13.900* :  What are the key takeaways from President Albradoel's time in office?
*17:14.540- 17:20.020* :  Well, economic policies, his austerity measures, he cuts salaries and government expenses,
*17:20.140- 17:26.600* :  including his own, to reduce spending and social welfare, which was a huge point for the
*17:26.600- 17:32.120* :  majority of Mexican voters, because he expanded programs like scholarships for youth, for young
*17:32.120- 17:39.140* :  people, pensions for older adults, and he increased the minimum wage, which also really impacted
*17:39.140- 17:39.760* :  the vote.
*17:39.760- 17:43.640* :  But his presidency didn't come without controversies.
*17:43.960- 17:49.900* :  He was accused of, and still is, of centralizing power, undermining press freedom, and face
*17:49.900- 17:51.520* :  criticism for fossil fuel investments.
*17:51.520- 17:55.860* :  So there were quite a few things that struck chords with a lot of the voters.
*17:56.380- 18:00.680* :  Of course, it wasn't enough for people to stray away from voting for the same party for
*18:00.680- 18:03.480* :  a sort of continuity of the same presidency.
*18:04.260- 18:05.340* :  Katarina Schultz.
*18:07.520- 18:08.160* :  Still to come.
*18:08.580- 18:13.560* :  I've had some indication from the powers that we, Gandalf, will make an appearance.
*18:13.560- 18:19.720* :  I'm not letting anybody else put on the pointy hat and the beard if I can help it.
*18:20.200- 18:25.840* :  We hear from veteran actor Sir Ian McKellen following his fall from a London stage earlier
*18:25.840- 18:26.280* :  this year.
*18:34.920- 18:39.940* :  Are you a professional pillow fighter or a 9-5 low cost time travel agent or maybe real
*18:39.940- 18:41.760* :  estate sales on Mars is your profession?
*18:42.880- 18:43.620* :  It doesn't matter.

*19:36.080- 19:39.540* :  delivery in as fast as 30 minutes all school year long.

*19:44.220- 19:47.120* :  Minimum $10 in order, additional terms apply.
*19:52.100- 19:57.500* :  Germany's anti-immigration alternative for Germany or AFD party is celebrating an historic
*19:57.500- 20:01.240* :  success with the victory in the eastern state of Therinja.
*20:01.720- 20:06.560* :  The AFD came a close second in Sunday's other state election in the more populist neighbouring
*20:06.580- 20:07.620* :  state of Saxony.
*20:08.180- 20:12.320* :  The German Chancellor, Olaf Schultz, has urged mainstream politicians not to lend support
*20:12.320- 20:13.020* :  to the party.
*20:13.500- 20:18.920* :  But the deputy leader of the AFD, Beatrice von Schork, said ignoring the AFD would mean
*20:18.920- 20:21.000* :  disregarding the wishes of voters.
*20:21.600- 20:27.460* :  It is very clear what voters have asked for, and you can see in both states there is
*20:27.460- 20:32.900* :  a good majority for the CDU and the AFD to form a coalition.
*20:32.960- 20:37.660* :  And if you ask the people, this is also backed by the majority of the people.
*20:38.120- 20:42.560* :  So by not doing so, this is neglecting of what the people want.
*20:43.220- 20:48.140* :  A member of the ruling SPD, Neil Schmid, told the BBC he doesn't expect the outcome to
*20:48.140- 20:51.940* :  have a significant impact on how the federal government functions.
*20:52.720- 21:00.060* :  These states count about 5 million inhabitants out of 80 million in Germany.
*21:00.820- 21:07.580* :  So yes, huge blow to the government, a wake-up call to defend democracy against anti-democratic
*21:07.580- 21:16.420* :  forces like the far-right, but there will be no immediate effect on the federal government.
*21:17.040- 21:20.960* :  I asked our correspondent in Berlin, David McGinnis, to give us his analysis.
*21:21.880- 21:26.580* :  Usually, regional elections are not connected to federal elections or the national vote.
*21:26.700- 21:31.100* :  So in that sense, you could say he's right, having said that, I think what we're already
*21:31.100- 21:33.280* :  seeing is a real effect nationally.
*21:33.280- 21:38.620* :  And that's because the three parties who are in this ruling national coalition government
*21:39.600- 21:42.520* :  all did so badly in these elections.
*21:43.460- 21:49.140* :  The difficulty is that for the past couple of years in government, they've all had to
*21:49.140- 21:53.040* :  make so many compromises, because these are very three very different parts, they usually
*21:53.040- 21:57.520* :  wouldn't form a alliance together, that they've really lost a lot of their voters.
*21:57.520- 22:01.260* :  A lot of their core voters are really disappointed with the compromises they've had to make.
*22:01.920- 22:06.360* :  What we're now seeing is that because they've all done so badly and because the AFD has
*22:06.360- 22:10.760* :  done so well, people within their parties are already now calling for them to defend their
*22:10.760- 22:11.960* :  turf even more.
*22:12.440- 22:16.460* :  And the problem is, it's a bit of a vicious circle because that's now going to lead
*22:16.460- 22:21.240* :  to an even more argumentative coalition government and these spats within the governing
*22:21.240- 22:23.940* :  coalition are one of the reasons why the government's been doing so badly.
*22:23.940- 22:29.240* :  So it's sort of a vicious circle in that the worst these parties do, the more they fight
*22:29.240- 22:31.060* :  and the more they fight, the worse they do.
*22:31.540- 22:35.300* :  And I think we're in this sort of almost a death spiral for the governing coalition where
*22:35.300- 22:39.240* :  people are saying, no, no, we're not going to split apart, we're not going to let the
*22:39.240- 22:39.900* :  government fall.
*22:39.920- 22:44.600* :  But you know, for government members to say that we're not going to let the government
*22:44.640- 22:44.860* :  fall.
*22:45.180- 22:46.520* :  And how bad it is really.
*22:46.920- 22:50.960* :  And how much widespread support is there for the AFD?
*22:51.680- 22:56.200* :  Well, certainly in parts of eastern Germany, they are very popular and by far the strongest
*22:56.420- 22:57.220* :  political force.
*22:57.220- 23:02.800* :  So in some local councils, they have quite powerful positions on a local municipal level,
*23:03.340- 23:07.380* :  particularly in rural, depopulated parts of eastern Germany, they're very strong.
*23:08.060- 23:10.540* :  In the cities, in eastern Germany, they do less well.
*23:10.540- 23:17.020* :  The cities are booming, a more diverse population, a younger population, and there the AFD doesn't
*23:17.020- 23:18.360* :  necessarily always do that well.
*23:18.800- 23:21.880* :  In western Germany, it really depends where you're looking, there are pockets where the
*23:21.880- 23:23.860* :  AFD does well, there are pockets where they don't.
*23:23.860- 23:29.500* :  I think though the main impact they've had nationally is on the rhetoric, on the discourse.
*23:29.500- 23:34.360* :  Since the end of the national parliament, the Bundesliga in 2017, they've really shifted
*23:34.360- 23:34.920* :  the debate.
*23:35.540- 23:41.320* :  The whole debate in parliament has become much more rancorous, the way the AFD talks, the
*23:41.320- 23:45.640* :  way they talk about minorities, the way they talk about certain communities within Germany,
*23:46.060- 23:49.880* :  has really shifted the dial on what's acceptable in Germany.
*23:49.900- 23:55.880* :  That combined with more ferocious discourse on social media and other chains in society.
*23:56.660- 23:59.940* :  But I think we've really seen a change in the rhetoric and that's impacted mainstream
*23:59.940- 24:02.800* :  parts as well, in terms of policy as well.
*24:02.800- 24:09.260* :  So for example, on migration, the AFD is fiercely anti-migrant, anti-refugee, in some cases
*24:09.260- 24:10.060* :  anti-Islam.
*24:11.020- 24:17.360* :  To undermine or to try and win back voters who've gone to the AFD, some mainstream parties
*24:17.360- 24:23.360* :  have started talking in a way that's not that dissimilar to the AFD and have started
*24:23.360- 24:27.200* :  suggesting policies which some would say are simply an AFD copy.
*24:27.200- 24:31.220* :  So we are seeing a change in how mainstream parties are acting as well.
*24:31.840- 24:37.580* :  Damian McGinnis, more than 4.5 billion people around the world use smartphones, that's
*24:37.580- 24:42.360* :  more than 60% of the global population and there are growing concerns about their impact
*24:42.360- 24:43.240* :  on children.
*24:43.760- 24:48.940* :  Now, a new BBC investigation has revealed that teenage boys have struggled to escape violent
*24:48.940- 24:53.340* :  and besogynistic content being served to them on their social media feeds.
*24:53.960- 24:58.460* :  Our disinformation and social media correspondent Mariana Spring has been finding out more about
*24:58.460- 24:59.840* :  it and why it happens.
*25:00.440- 25:04.940* :  A lot of this does come back to the algorithms recommendation systems that push our stuff
*25:04.940- 25:08.720* :  based on what they think we might like and based on the preferences of other users.
*25:08.740- 25:13.500* :  It's all to keep us coming back, but the kinds of stuff that can keep us gripped can
*25:13.500- 25:15.340* :  also be harmful, especially for teenagers.
*25:15.560- 25:20.220* :  And I've chatted to several teenagers, including Kai, who's now 18, who told me he's found
*25:20.220- 25:25.520* :  it very difficult to escape violence and misogyny served up on his TikTok and Instagram feeds
*25:25.880- 25:26.700* :  since he was 15.
*25:26.700- 25:30.380* :  He said the tools that he's used indicate that he doesn't want to see particular videos
*25:30.380- 25:34.480* :  on the sites haven't worked and when he comments on posts to say he doesn't want them or
*25:34.480- 25:39.240* :  tries to reset his algorithms when he accidentally likes a video, his feed is just flooded with
*25:39.240- 25:40.000* :  more, he says.
*25:40.300- 25:44.840* :  He's into boxing, but he doesn't want to see some of this more extreme content, including
*25:44.840- 25:48.500* :  glorifying domestic violence, for example, and not only has this had an impact on him,
*25:48.780- 25:53.340* :  but also some of his friends too, he told me about one friend who started to adopt misogynystic
*25:53.340- 25:55.560* :  views off the back of watching these kinds of videos.
*25:56.220- 26:00.260* :  And Kai says his feed looks very different from those of girls the same age that he
*26:23.800- 26:23.820* :  knows.
*26:24.720- 26:28.060* :  To find out why this was happening, I tracked down some of the people who've been working
*26:28.060- 26:31.820* :  on the inside of the social media companies, including someone called Andrew Cuang, who
*26:31.820- 26:35.780* :  worked at TikTok in Dublin for 19 months until 2022.
*26:36.440- 26:40.740* :  And as part of an effort to help keep teenagers safer, he says he and a colleague decided
*26:40.740- 26:44.740* :  to check what was being recommended to some 16 year olds on the app.
*26:45.100- 26:50.820* :  If you're a female, a 16 year old who live in London, they're just usually interested
*26:50.820- 26:59.800* :  in the pop singers, the songs, makeup, whereas it's very different for teenage boy and
*26:59.800- 27:08.020* :  so stabbing, knifing, type of content, sometimes sexual content, and of course mostly with the
*27:08.340- 27:11.900* :  misogynystic sort of controversial hate content as well.
*27:12.960- 27:16.760* :  According to Andrew Cuang, the algorithms fuel his engagement regardless of whether
*27:16.760- 27:20.920* :  that engagement is positive or negative, and that could explain in part why Kai's efforts
*27:20.920- 27:22.780* :  to manipulate the algorithms weren't working.
*27:22.780- 27:26.940* :  According to TikTok, the algorithms are not informed by a user's gender, but Andrew
*27:26.940- 27:30.860* :  says the interest teenagers express when they sign up often have the effect of dividing
*27:30.860- 27:35.500* :  them up along gender lines, which explains why a 16 year old could be recommended violent
*27:35.500- 27:37.000* :  content to begin with.
*27:37.620- 27:41.400* :  Andrew says the algorithm recommending content to TikToks for you page doesn't always
*27:41.400- 27:45.860* :  differentiate between harmful and non-harmful content, and one of the problems he identified
*27:45.860- 27:50.420* :  when he worked at TikTok was that the team is involved in training and coding that algorithm
*27:50.700- 27:53.920* :  to not always know the exact natures of the video that it was recommending.
*27:54.440- 27:59.280* :  I reached out to the social media companies about all of this, TikTok says that it has
*27:59.280- 28:03.840* :  40,000 safety staff working alongside innovative technology to keep its apps safe.
*28:04.400- 28:08.220* :  It says it doesn't use gender to recommend content, has settings for teens to block content
*28:08.220- 28:12.060* :  that may not be suitable, and doesn't allow extreme violence or misogyny.
*28:12.480- 28:16.320* :  The matter which owns Instagram says it's introduced over 50 different tools, resources
*28:16.320- 28:21.100* :  and features, including for parental supervision and reducing sensitive content for teens.
*28:22.020- 28:22.800* :  Mariana Spring
*28:23.740- 28:27.500* :  Political statements and protests are a recurring theme at the Olympic Games.
*28:27.960- 28:33.520* :  Paris 2024 was no exception when an Afghan breakdance was disqualified for wearing a
*28:33.520- 28:37.820* :  cape with the words free Afghan women during her pre-qualifying routine.
*28:38.380- 28:43.200* :  In her first news conference since the Games, Maniza Talash says she has no regrets, and
*28:43.200- 28:45.440* :  if given the chance, would do the same again.
*28:46.160- 28:50.680* :  Since they resume control of Afghanistan three years ago, the Taliban's restrictions on
*28:50.680- 28:56.000* :  women's freedoms have drawn sharp criticism from human rights groups and from many foreign
*28:56.000- 28:56.420* :  governments.
*29:02.360- 29:07.460* :  It was in the noisy open-air arena in the plastic icon call that Maniza Talash made her
*29:07.460- 29:08.000* :  stand.
*29:08.520- 29:13.360* :  During her battle against India's Sajo, the Netherlands, the 21-year-old unveiled a light
*29:13.360- 29:16.060* :  blue cape made from the material of a burka.
*29:16.420- 29:19.860* :  The headdress, the Taliban said, all Afghan women must wear.
*29:20.400- 29:22.940* :  It displayed the words free Afghan women.
*29:25.480- 29:30.500* :  All 50 of the Olympic charter explicitly bans the display of any political messaging,
*29:31.120- 29:33.060* :  including signs or arm bans.
*29:33.540- 29:36.320* :  As a result, she was disqualified from the competition.
*29:36.500- 29:38.960* :  A decision she does not regret.
*29:42.400- 29:47.440* :  Lots of people ask if it was a difficult decision to sacrifice my Olympic dream to make
*29:47.440- 29:48.060* :  this message.
*29:48.820- 29:54.140* :  For me, it was very simple, because when there is a cause to defend, you go out there
*29:54.140- 29:54.940* :  and do it.
*29:55.800- 29:59.160* :  It was important to me to use the burka in the form of wings.
*29:59.340- 30:05.440* :  I wanted it to symbolize Afghan women escaping, freeing themselves and taking flight.
*30:06.300- 30:11.300* :  When the Taliban reached her control, Talash, originally from Kabul, made the decision to
*30:11.340- 30:12.180* :  flee the country.
*30:12.440- 30:14.680* :  She ended up settling in Spain.
*30:15.280- 30:21.620* :  She was one of the 37 Afghans and six Afghans selected by the IOC to compete for the refugee
*30:21.620- 30:22.080* :  team.
*30:23.180- 30:28.300* :  I am not gifted at speaking publicly, but I like to take action.
*30:29.080- 30:32.060* :  I am like a bomb because I grew up among the bombs.
*30:32.760- 30:38.040* :  In the three years under Taliban rule, women have been excluded from almost every aspect
*30:38.040- 30:39.180* :  of public life.
*30:39.660- 30:44.520* :  Last week, the group issued a banner on women's voices being heard and faces being seen
*30:44.520- 30:45.320* :  in public.
*30:46.000- 30:50.620* :  Talash says she hopes women's freedoms will one day return to Afghanistan.
*30:51.720- 30:54.840* :  The day will come when we will be reunited on our own land.
*30:55.640- 30:58.060* :  On that day, we can live together again.
*30:58.060- 31:02.980* :  I want to tell them not to give up for people who keep fighting for them.
*31:07.060- 31:12.120* :  The UN has said that the Taliban must improve life for women in Afghanistan if they have
*31:12.120- 31:14.360* :  any hope of international recognition.
*31:15.020- 31:20.560* :  In reply, the Taliban say their law is firmly rooted in Islamic teachings, and it should
*31:20.560- 31:22.520* :  be respected and understood.
*31:23.440- 31:24.060* :  Ella Bicknell.
*31:24.780- 31:29.440* :  And finally, the actor Sir Ian McKellen known for his role as Gandalf in the Lord of the
*31:29.440- 31:34.520* :  Rings franchise and his many appearances in Shakespeare's plays has told the BBC that
*31:34.520- 31:38.300* :  at 85 years old, he has no plans to retire from acting.
*31:38.840- 31:42.920* :  He fell off stage early this year during a theatre production in London, breaking his
*31:42.920- 31:43.280* :  wrist.
*31:43.600- 31:45.280* :  Tim Mufford has been speaking to him.
*31:45.800- 31:54.600* :  It was a nasty fall and it was a shock initially, but I fractured my wrist so every kid
*31:54.600- 31:55.980* :  does when it falls on his bike.
*31:57.640- 31:59.500* :  And Chypto Vertebri.
*32:00.000- 32:01.980* :  And do you remember how it happened?
*32:01.980- 32:08.920* :  I am moving about, got my foot caught and the remains of a chair which I tried to kick
*32:08.960- 32:14.500* :  off and during that I propel myself forward as it were on a skateboard on the newspaper
*32:14.660- 32:21.980* :  of China's surface down to the four stage and then off the stage was a three foot drop,
*32:22.340- 32:26.400* :  partly broken by a member of the audience on the front row.
*32:26.720- 32:32.140* :  I was extremely lucky when that I was wearing a padded suit because full staff at the
*32:32.140- 32:34.040* :  party I was playing is fat.
*32:34.760- 32:39.760* :  It wasn't that I got dizzy or anything like that, it was a pure accident.
*32:40.340- 32:45.260* :  So I can't myself lucky that it's beginning to be a distant memory.
*32:45.860- 32:50.140* :  I mean your work ethic has been revered within the industry and beyond for many many years.
*32:50.140- 32:52.140* :  Has it an agey reassess that at all?
*32:52.360- 32:57.080* :  I don't think so, they've got an ethic, it's just what else would I be doing if I wasn't
*32:57.080- 32:57.480* :  working.
*32:57.740- 33:03.280* :  I shall take the rest of the year off and then get back to work in January.
*33:03.560- 33:10.900* :  Just keep at it as long as the legs and the lungs and the mind keep working.
*33:11.720- 33:17.340* :  I forget names and of course when you say that to somebody they say, oh me too, and
*33:17.340- 33:18.780* :  you think, well is it the human condition?
*33:19.740- 33:23.760* :  And it does run at, and runs mid eight, there's no too many names.
*33:24.460- 33:29.880* :  When you're older you've got more to remember than people who are young, nevertheless it's
*33:29.880- 33:33.140* :  a nuisance when you can't remember your best friend's name, you know.
*33:33.660- 33:35.900* :  Is there a particular role of which you're most proud?
*33:36.440- 33:40.740* :  I was in a wonderful production by Trevor Nunn for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1976
*33:41.740- 33:42.620* :  of my best.
*33:43.120- 33:49.600* :  If you can manage to take on all the intricacies and subtleties of Shakespeare's verse and
*33:49.600- 33:54.440* :  then make it seem as if you're making it up as you go along, then you've cracked the
*33:54.460- 33:55.900* :  biggest problem of doing Shakespeare.
*33:56.380- 34:00.260* :  And then all of the things is my Casablanca, you know.
*34:00.420- 34:05.100* :  Another one, the hunt for Gollum, is due to be made, will you be playing Gandalf in it?
*34:05.760- 34:11.480* :  Well I've had some indication from the powers that be Gandalf will make an appearance.
*34:12.400- 34:17.640* :  I'm not letting anybody else put on the pointy hat and the beard if I can help it.
*34:18.440- 34:19.620* :  Sir Ian McKellen.
