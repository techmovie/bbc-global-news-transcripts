*01:36.860- 01:40.020* :  This is the Global News Podcast for the BBC World Service.
*01:42.480- 01:48.120* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Monday the 9th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:48.700- 01:54.660* :  Nicolas Maduro's rival in the widely disputed presidential election fleeced to Spain and claims
*01:54.660- 02:00.640* :  political asylum. More than 700 children are caught up in an alleged rogue surgeon investigation
*02:00.660- 02:06.520* :  at the world famous Great Ormond Street Hospital. South Korea's military has removed all online
*02:06.520- 02:11.140* :  digital photos of its staff to prevent them falling victim to deep fake pornography.
*02:14.420- 02:18.640* :  Also in this podcast, I would say that it's a very cold place where it's winter and time
*02:18.640- 02:22.320* :  fun stuff at the year. So if you're going to go bundle up, do not bring any
*02:22.320- 02:28.960* :  vitals and be very, very careful. Tips for travelers to North Korea as the secretive dictatorship
*02:28.960- 02:38.220* :  prepares to open up to tourism. It's been six weeks since the authorities in Venezuela declared
*02:38.220- 02:43.700* :  Nicolas Maduro the winner of the presidential election without releasing the detailed results.
*02:44.140- 02:48.760* :  The opposition cried foul, saying the election was rigged and that their candidate Ed Bondo
*02:48.760- 02:54.640* :  Gonzalez was the rightful winner. He went into hiding after the election and prosecutors issued
*02:54.640- 03:00.000* :  a warrant for his arrest. Now, he's been flown to Spain on board a Spanish military plane.
*03:00.420- 03:05.920* :  Back in Venezuela, the Attorney General Tarek Williams' sub confirmed Mr. Gonzalez' exit
*03:05.920- 03:09.280* :  from the country had been allowed after careful negotiations.
*03:13.060- 03:18.580* :  The governments of Spain and Venezuela agreed to grant a safe conduct to the citizen Ed Bondo
*03:18.580- 03:24.240* :  Gonzalez so that he could leave his national territory and benefit from the asylum granted by
*03:24.240- 03:30.320* :  Spain. Consequently, the Attorney General's office expresses its absolute respect for the decisions
*03:31.060- 03:40.760* :  of the Venezuelan government. Antonio Ledesma is another leading Venezuelan opposition
*03:40.760- 03:46.200* :  politician already in exile in Spain. He's a former mayor of Caracas and is now
*03:46.200- 03:51.340* :  international coordinator of the political movement still led by Maria Carina Machado,
*03:51.840- 03:57.080* :  who was barred from running for president and who is in hiding in the Venezuelan capital.
*03:57.560- 04:03.520* :  Paul Henley asked Mr. Ledesma why he thought Ed Bondo Gonzalez had felt compelled to join him
*04:03.520- 04:15.720* :  in Madrid. I believe that it is mainly because he felt that his life and his families were in
*04:15.720- 04:21.020* :  danger. Edmondo Gonzalez has been suffering lots of harassment in the last few days. Look,
*04:21.360- 04:26.780* :  it is enough to mention that they issued an arrest warrant for him, but the situation is
*04:26.940- 04:31.640* :  escalated and that is what led him to leave Venezuela so he could protect not only his life,
*04:31.700- 04:37.480* :  but also the political project that represents so much for our country. He has the trust of more than
*04:37.480- 04:48.100* :  7.3 million Venezuelans who elected him as the president on July 28. Will it be possible for Mr.
*04:48.100- 04:52.780* :  Gonzalez to stay politically active and effective from Spain?
*04:57.280- 05:03.360* :  I think it's not only possible, but fundamental. Mr. Gonzalez and Maria Carina Machado have formed
*05:03.360- 05:09.680* :  a duo and now this union is opening up so Edmondo Gonzalez can move freely as president-elect
*05:09.680- 05:15.520* :  in other parts of the world, leading the diaspora, and Maria Carina Machado can carry out the work
*05:15.980- 05:26.600* :  as the visible head of this movement. Will he work with him? Of course, we are all ready to
*05:26.600- 05:33.020* :  welcome him to join his agenda. I spoke a lot to Maria Carina Machado today about what we have
*05:33.020- 05:38.840* :  to do now, and that's pushing so the Spanish Parliament can pass a proposition on Tuesday that
*05:38.840- 05:42.940* :  recognizes Edmondo Gonzalez as the legitimate president of Venezuela.
*05:46.280- 05:53.160* :  Maria Carina Machado is a woman with an extraordinary capacity for resilience.
*05:53.160- 05:59.600* :  She adapts to the circumstances and turns any adversity into an opportunity. She has been
*05:59.600- 06:05.280* :  attacked by a regime not only physically, but also when they disqualify her from being our
*06:05.280- 06:12.440* :  presidential candidate. And she has been reinventing herself so she can fulfill that historical role,
*06:12.440- 06:22.500* :  which is to lead the opposition and its fight. Why is it so important for her to stay in Venezuela?
*06:24.620- 06:29.180* :  She has said it. What is happening in Venezuela is a spiritual struggle and the
*06:29.180- 06:34.220* :  fuel to keep people's energy on is faith, is hope, and the trust that they have in
*06:34.220- 06:38.400* :  Maria Carina Machado, she is a woman who has been coherent and brave.
*06:43.020- 06:47.600* :  Tell us about your experience as a politically active member of the opposition in exile.
*06:53.600- 06:58.960* :  We have to try to manage the hopes in here. It is a very difficult task because we have
*06:58.960- 07:04.420* :  Venezuelans spread all over the world, and we are talking about the humanitarian disaster with
*07:04.420- 07:10.880* :  almost 9 million people that has left the country. And here in exile, you have to deal with
*07:10.880- 07:16.760* :  the nostalgia, the melancholy, and the anger that Venezuelan citizens are brought off and feel,
*07:16.760- 07:23.320* :  because they have experienced so many letdowns. And that is why Maria Carina Machado has insisted
*07:23.320- 07:29.320* :  that we should do everything possible so that people do not lose hope and become this courage.
*07:35.680- 07:37.000* :  Antonio Ledesma
*07:38.120- 07:42.140* :  Great almond street in London is one of the world's leading children's hospitals,
*07:42.140- 07:46.340* :  treating thousands of sick youngsters from more than 80 countries every year.
*07:46.680- 07:51.880* :  Opened in 1852, it is rightly proud of its history and excellence. But on Sunday,
*07:51.880- 07:57.580* :  it said that it was carrying out a review into the cases of more than 700 of its patients because
*07:57.580- 08:02.340* :  of concerns raised about a former surgeon. Lawyers representing a number of the families
*08:02.340- 08:08.180* :  said that children were subjected to unnecessary surgery and had come to severe harm.
*08:08.540- 08:10.640* :  Elizabeth Malayakow is one of the lawyers.
*08:11.340- 08:16.000* :  What we do know from representing clients who are children is that sometimes the injuries
*08:16.000- 08:21.800* :  don't manifest until they're much older. And families and our clients, the patients want to know.
*08:22.360- 08:27.080* :  Firstly, if they have suffered harm or alternatively, whether they are likely to suffer injuries in
*08:27.080- 08:31.780* :  the future on account of treatment they've received. And if that is the case, they may wish to seek
*08:31.780- 08:37.060* :  treatment and advise elsewhere. And it's very important for them to know that so soon the trust
*08:37.060- 08:41.600* :  can conclude that the better. I heard more from our correspondent, Ellie Price.
*08:42.380- 08:47.500* :  We know that yes, Jabba no longer works for Great almond streets. He's not had a license to
*08:47.540- 08:52.720* :  practice here in the UK since January, but we understand he is still working at an orthopedic
*08:52.720- 08:59.660* :  clinic in Dubai. What we know is that Great almond street is looking into 721 patients. Of course,
*08:59.660- 09:04.860* :  all children, it being a children's hospital who had come into contact with yes, a Jabba while
*09:04.860- 09:11.160* :  he worked there as a surgeon. Now so far of the 39 cases that the hospital has reviewed more than
*09:11.160- 09:17.320* :  half of those children were found to have been harmed. So 13 of those children were severely harmed.
*09:17.480- 09:20.600* :  And when you say harmed, what kind of harm have they come to?
*09:20.900- 09:24.980* :  Well, we've spoken to lawyers representing some of the families treated by yes, a Jabba,
*09:25.540- 09:30.500* :  who say children as young as four months old were subjected to unnecessary surgery and suffered
*09:30.500- 09:36.680* :  life-changing injuries. In fact, one child had to undergo an amputation that could possibly have
*09:36.680- 09:41.360* :  been avoided if different treatment had been followed. Now, of course, the world famous children's
*09:41.360- 09:46.360* :  hospital, Great almond street, has said it's incredibly sorry for the worry and uncertainty caused
*09:46.840- 09:49.980* :  and that it has contacted all patients and families affected.
*09:50.600- 09:55.520* :  Do we know where this goes from here? Well, it's likely to take 18 months. We're told to complete
*09:55.520- 10:02.020* :  this review from the hospital. It's got to go through, as I say, the 721 patients that had any
*10:02.020- 10:06.840* :  contact with this surgeon, who's obviously not working there. So I think it's important to note
*10:06.840- 10:11.540* :  that well over half of those patients that he saw, they'll be reviewed, but their deem to have not
*10:11.540- 10:17.200* :  necessarily had an urgent review, i.e., their cases aren't necessarily likely to be terribly urgent
*10:17.200- 10:21.320* :  to be looked into. So I think it's important to note that it's not everyone who ever came into
*10:21.320- 10:26.460* :  contact with him, but certainly this is a review that will go on for 18 months. Now, we have
*10:26.460- 10:32.120* :  contacted Mr Jabba for comment, but as so far we haven't heard anything back. Great almond street
*10:32.120- 10:38.760* :  hospital also asked the Royal College of Surgeons to look into the practices surrounding this particular
*10:38.760- 10:44.440* :  department and this particular surgeon. That report has been published, but only confidentially,
*10:44.440- 10:48.040* :  and we're told that it will be made public on Christmas Eve of this year.
*10:48.580- 10:55.200* :  Ellie Price. A prominent Russian opposition activist has told the BBC she is 100% sure a journalist,
*10:55.200- 11:00.380* :  Pablo Gonzales, who was deported to Russia last month as part of a giant prisoner swap with
*11:00.380- 11:06.100* :  Western countries, is in fact a Russian intelligence agent. In her first interview on the topic,
*11:06.100- 11:12.500* :  Zana Nemtsova said she wanted to warn others of the danger from Russian spies. Mr. Gonzales,
*11:12.500- 11:19.960* :  a Spanish citizen, born in Moscow as Pablo Rootsov, was arrested in Poland in 2022. The espionage
*11:19.960- 11:26.380* :  case against him is classified, but the BBC has heard detailed testimony of how he infiltrated
*11:26.380- 11:31.940* :  Russian opposition circles abroad in order to report back on them to his handlers in Russian
*11:31.940- 11:38.100* :  intelligence. He says he's an innocent man, a Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford reports.
*11:43.900- 11:50.140* :  In August, Vladimir Putin welcomed home a group of Russian agents and a hitman for his FSB
*11:50.140- 11:57.880* :  intelligence service. They had just been swapped for a group of Westerners taken prisoner in Russia
*11:58.540- 12:05.900* :  and several Russian dissidents. Standing before Mr. Putin that day was Pablo Rootsov with a dark
*12:05.900- 12:14.100* :  beard, a bald head, and a secret mission for Russian intelligence. And you had no idea what he was
*12:14.100- 12:21.840* :  doing, right? To be honest, I got my first suspicion in 2019 and everybody said no, no, no, this is
*12:22.400- 12:27.840* :  this is nonsense, nonsense. That's Jean-Anne and Sova, a prominent Russian opposition figure
*12:27.840- 12:35.800* :  in exile. And she knew the bearded man as Pablo Gonzales, a Spanish journalist. Two years ago,
*12:35.800- 12:42.620* :  he was arrested in Poland and accused of espionage for Russia. This is Jean-Anne's first interview
*12:42.620- 12:49.740* :  about what happened. People regard you as a crazy person, so they can say you are paranoid,
*12:49.740- 12:56.860* :  you know? But I was right. Absolutely right. Pablo had talked his way into Jean-Anne's circle
*12:56.860- 13:04.120* :  back in 2016. She now knows he was informing on their activities from the start, writing character
*13:04.120- 13:11.200* :  reports to a handler. She was shown Pablo's reports by Polish investigators, but she can't disclose
*13:11.200- 13:17.200* :  any details. Like the Polish authorities, Jean-Anne believes those reports were sent to Russian
*13:17.200- 13:26.920* :  military intelligence, the GRU. These people regard you as their enemies. His words are important
*13:27.560- 13:35.080* :  to the GRU and it might have led to very serious consequences, which does not suggest that Pablo
*13:35.080- 13:41.740* :  will cause some damage, but they have other people who are doing this. So this is why this is
*13:42.900- 13:48.880* :  she knows what she's talking about. Her father was Boris Nemtsov, an opposition leader in Russia,
*13:49.500- 13:56.560* :  assassinated in 2015, right next to the Kremlin. Can I ask you just completely, clearly, you have no
*13:56.560- 14:04.100* :  doubt that Pablo Gonzales, Pablo Rupsov, is or was this by? Yes, I have no doubt. I wanted to
*14:05.600- 14:12.680* :  warn people that it's not something very far away from us. It's not something that you
*14:12.940- 14:21.660* :  can read in books or watch in movies. It's very close. People should be very careful. That's it.
*14:22.040- 14:28.180* :  Jean-Anne herself left Russia for safety after her dad's murder. In Europe, she didn't use to think
*14:28.180- 14:35.260* :  much about her security, but the unmasking of Pablo, the Spanish journalist, has changed everything.
*14:36.060- 14:42.920* :  That report by Sarah Rensford. After 11 days of competition involving more than 4,400 athletes
*14:42.920- 14:51.500* :  from 168 nations and 549 medals up the grabs, the Paris Paralympics has now ended with a spectacular
*14:51.500- 14:57.020* :  closing ceremony, presided over by President Macron and the president of the International
*14:57.020- 15:02.500* :  Paralympics Committee, Andrew Parsons. China was the overall winner. Great Britain came second,
*15:02.500- 15:08.420* :  and the hosts France had their most successful games, coming eighth. I heard more from our
*15:08.420- 15:14.780* :  sports reporter, Paul Serres. An incredibly fitting and apt end, Alex, to what has been an
*15:14.780- 15:21.240* :  incredible two months or so in the French capital. Paris kicked off its racing spikes and slipped
*15:21.240- 15:28.360* :  on its dancing shoes as DJs mixed the music of French superstars of years gone by Johnny Alliday and
*15:28.360- 15:35.060* :  Edith Piaf with hip-hop beats and break dancers at a packed step to France. There was a brief moment
*15:35.060- 15:41.200* :  of calm as the mayor of Paris and Idaalgo. She handed the Paralympic flag to her LA counterpart
*15:41.200- 15:46.980* :  Karen Bass with Los Angeles set to host the next games in four years' time. There was a cross
*15:46.980- 15:52.340* :  two LA with the jazz pianist Matthew Whitaker, the singer Anderson Park, reigniting the party
*15:52.860- 15:58.700* :  before things came back to Paris, the mulley and duo of Amadou and Mariam. And then six French
*15:58.700- 16:04.140* :  athletes, including Oralie Obert, Gold Medalist in Boccia, and the three-time Gold Medalist in
*16:04.140- 16:10.840* :  Paris cycling, Machu, Bosrodon, extinguished the Paralympic flame, signaling the end of what has
*16:10.840- 16:16.060* :  been an incredible summer of Olympic and Paralympic games. So quite a fitting legacy for Paralympic
*16:16.060- 16:22.700* :  sports, particularly in France. Absolutely, yes. A city more suited now to wheelchair users and
*16:22.700- 16:27.160* :  others with needs. Baroness Tannigre Thompson, a winner of eleven Paralympic Gold medals
*16:27.600- 16:32.360* :  in an incredible career called it, a Paralympic overlay. Organizers have used many
*16:32.780- 16:36.860* :  established and stunningly beautiful venues throughout the games, the Palace at Versailles,
*16:36.860- 16:42.120* :  the Grand Palais, and the Paralympic overlay has made them infinitely more accessible for everyday
*16:42.120- 16:46.560* :  people. And the city itself has become more accessible. Buses are wheelchair friendly. Now the
*16:46.560- 16:53.120* :  Metro is yet to catch up. Some lanes, road lanes exclusively used for games traffic will become
*16:53.120- 16:58.720* :  legacy routes for use from next year onwards for public transport and for car sharing. So,
*16:59.240- 17:04.180* :  you know, legacy is the buzz word since probably since the Barcelona Games in 92 and Paris will be
*17:04.180- 17:11.960* :  blessed with an incredible legacy. Paul Sarah's. Still to come. Life is too short.
*17:12.440- 17:16.520* :  Geno, I don't want to look back and go, why did I worry about that thing?
*17:17.600- 17:21.880* :  The movie star Kate Winslet on Hollywood's ongoing problem with body image.
*17:30.740- 17:36.040* :  Are you a professional pillow fighter or a 9-5 low-cost time travel agent or maybe real estate

*18:49.000- 18:54.380* :  17 months of fighting have left so many dead incident that the makeshift graveyards are visible
*18:54.380- 19:00.800* :  from space. An estimated 150,000 people have been killed more than 10 million are thought to have
*19:00.800- 19:07.100* :  led their homes and now famine stalks the land with fears that 2.5 million civilians could starve
*19:07.100- 19:13.160* :  by the end of the year. It's that fear of a famine worse even than that in Ethiopia back in
*19:13.160- 19:19.000* :  the 1980s that has prompted UN experts to call for an international force to protect civilians.
*19:19.000- 19:25.120* :  The UN population funds regional director Laila Baker spelled out why such a force was needed.
*19:25.600- 19:30.900* :  80% of the health facilities in some areas have been damaged, particularly in Khartoum
*19:31.180- 19:36.640* :  and the western part of the country. The UN operational agencies, the humanitarian agencies
*19:36.640- 19:44.940* :  like UNFPA, need to have unhindered unconditional access to those populations that means bringing
*19:44.940- 19:49.980* :  in goods, supplies and people to relieve the situation on the ground.
*19:50.400- 19:54.460* :  And yet no sooner was the call made than it was rejected by the Sudanese government
*19:54.460- 19:59.880* :  with the foreign ministry calling the UN Mission Political and Illegal and accusing it
*20:00.120- 20:05.340* :  of violating its mandate. For more on what lies behind the decision and the risks of global
*20:05.340- 20:10.560* :  inaction, I spoke to our African regional editor Richard Kegoy on the line from Nairobi.
*20:10.920- 20:16.680* :  Both sides are the paramilitaries RSF and the Sudanese National Army have been accused of
*20:16.680- 20:21.260* :  committing what the team of experts described as the harrowing human rights of our
*20:21.260- 20:25.600* :  relations and the international crimes. So they're talking about crimes such as the sexual
*20:25.600- 20:32.480* :  violence, a bitterly arrest, torture and detention. So the RSF has been accused by the Sudanese
*20:32.480- 20:37.360* :  National Army of targeting civilians. So they claim that they've been using airstrikes
*20:37.360- 20:43.120* :  to shell schools, hospitals, communication networks, key water and electricity supplies.
*20:43.680- 20:48.340* :  Now because of the fighting that has been going on, delivery of aid has been obstructed
*20:48.520- 20:52.460* :  and this has really put to the vulnerable populations people displaced are from their homes
*20:52.460- 20:57.800* :  because of the war at a very tricky situation. So we're looking at humanitarian organizations saying
*20:57.800- 21:03.820* :  that 30% of the population is undernourished because the war has disrupted food production and
*21:03.820- 21:08.920* :  delivery of aid and essential supplies and that's why they're saying it's important that there is
*21:08.920- 21:14.640* :  intervention through the deployment of a foreign force that's going to be neutral and also
*21:15.320- 21:20.320* :  ensure that the situation which at the moment is considered to be very dire and they declare the
*21:20.320- 21:26.620* :  UN team of experts are farming at one of the camps called a Zamzam because 500,000 people,
*21:26.620- 21:33.360* :  that's half a million people were at risk of starvation. Given just how horrendous things are,
*21:33.360- 21:38.560* :  why has the government dismissed this call for an international force to secure the delivery
*21:38.560- 21:42.540* :  of supplies to starving people? What they're saying is that they want the national
*21:42.540- 21:47.200* :  process to be prioritized, specifically the JEDA peace agreement. So they're saying when you
*21:47.200- 21:52.960* :  deploy an external force, an international foreign force, then that amounts to an external
*21:52.960- 21:58.260* :  mechanism to sort out what is an internal issue. That's why they've been very reluctant to take
*21:58.260- 22:03.480* :  part in other initiatives like at the UN sponsored talks that took place in Geneva recently.
*22:03.640- 22:09.660* :  Richard, the world up to now hasn't really paid a lot of attention to the war in Sudan but it
*22:09.660- 22:14.500* :  is fair to say this really does have consequences for the rest of the world, doesn't it?
*22:14.620- 22:19.240* :  Absolutely because a lot of people don't seem to really appreciate what is at stake at the moment.
*22:19.780- 22:25.640* :  This crisis, if not addressed, it could snowball to not only a regional but a global crisis.
*22:26.420- 22:31.480* :  So from a humanitarian point of view, they're saying that we're looking at around 6 to 10 million
*22:31.480- 22:37.840* :  people at risk of dying by 2027 from starvation. Another thing is if you look at geographically
*22:37.840- 22:42.840* :  the positioning of Sudan because of the long porous border, people would be smuggled through
*22:42.840- 22:48.380* :  Libya across the Mediterranean Sea into Europe, which has really been dealing with the migration
*22:48.940- 22:54.900* :  crisis. Richard Kegoi. The Israeli military says three security guards have been killed by a
*22:54.900- 23:00.040* :  government at a border crossing between Jordan and the occupied West Bank. The attacker was shot
*23:00.040- 23:05.680* :  dead by Israeli forces, Mike Thompson reports from Jerusalem. The attacker, named by the Israeli
*23:05.680- 23:11.640* :  military as Maharajazi, is said to have approached the Allenby bridge crossing from Jordan in a
*23:11.640- 23:17.920* :  lorry before leaping out an opening fire. He was then shot dead by Israeli security forces.
*23:18.540- 23:24.040* :  This is the first attack from Jordan on Israeli personnel since the start of the Gaza war.
*23:24.040- 23:30.440* :  The man's motives are unclear, but Jordan is home to a large number of Palestinian refugees,
*23:30.440- 23:36.320* :  and the country has been deeply critical of Israel's actions in Gaza. Her mass has called the
*23:36.320- 23:43.160* :  attacker a brave hero, but Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has described him as a
*23:43.160- 23:51.200* :  loathsome terrorist inspired by Iran's murderous ideology. Jordan says it has begun a full investigation.
*23:51.340- 23:56.520* :  The Allenby bridge crossing, along with Israel's two land crossings with Jordan,
*23:56.520- 24:03.880* :  will remain closed until further notice. Mike Thompson. The Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet has
*24:03.880- 24:09.460* :  joined other Hollywood stars and spoken out against women being made to conform to female
*24:09.460- 24:15.580* :  body stereotypes on screen. She spoke to the BBC's Laura Kuhnsberg about her new movie Li, a
*24:15.580- 24:21.180* :  biopic on the extraordinary life of the Vogue model Li Miller, who became a photojournalist
*24:21.180- 24:30.900* :  during the Second World War. Li Miller was a female photographer who found herself becoming a
*24:30.900- 24:38.240* :  war correspondent during the Second World War. She was an American woman. She was just an extraordinary
*24:39.540- 24:49.140* :  life force of a woman who, through herself, at life, lived it full throttle, even if it meant
*24:50.280- 24:55.940* :  suffering the consequences and paying an emotional price for bearing witness the things that she
*24:55.940- 25:02.580* :  experienced, how she came to be in a conflict zone documenting the truth behind the atrocities
*25:02.580- 25:10.080* :  of the Nazi regime, for the female readers of British Vogue. She was just unbelievable. It's not a film
*25:10.080- 25:16.360* :  about a war. It's about her internal war with herself and the consequences, the personal price
*25:16.380- 25:23.340* :  that she paid for putting herself through the challenges of documenting exactly what had happened.
*25:24.140- 25:30.780* :  Tell me about Li Miller in the bath. So there is an iconic image of Li Miller in Hitler's bath tub.
*25:31.060- 25:36.600* :  So on the same day that she was in Dachau concentration camp, she and David Sherman drove to
*25:36.600- 25:41.720* :  meet Droughtom Unic and they had a right to Hitler's apartment, probably bribed their way in and
*25:41.720- 25:48.020* :  yeah sure, there was a bathroom, there was hot water and a bath tub. But of course as she got in that
*25:48.020- 25:54.480* :  bath, I can totally see Li with her sense of whimsy and just how brazen she was. My god that was a
*25:54.480- 25:59.240* :  damn fine scoop. There was no way she wasn't going to get her good friend, David Sherman,
*25:59.240- 26:06.360* :  of Life magazine to photograph her in that tub. You were asked a while ago about a scene in the film
*26:06.360- 26:10.580* :  and you said that there was a crew somebody on set had said oh you should sit up. Of course it created
*26:11.360- 26:16.600* :  headlines because what you had talked about was the Euro physical appearance inside a film when
*26:16.600- 26:23.620* :  you were playing a character and do you find there's a bit of a trap for because for many years you've
*26:23.620- 26:29.520* :  been incredibly honest and candid about how the body police come for a female for women in the public
*26:29.520- 26:36.000* :  eye and then if you don't say anything if you don't call it out well then you tolerate it but if
*26:36.000- 26:42.740* :  you do say something then that creates a story and headlines all of its own. Well you know it's
*26:42.740- 26:47.960* :  interesting how much people do like labels for women and they very much like them in
*26:47.960- 26:52.180* :  these days and annoyingly they sort of still do you know we have we slapped these labels on women
*26:52.180- 26:58.920* :  that we just don't have for men it's absolutely bizarre to me. It was my job to be like Li. She
*26:58.920- 27:04.760* :  wasn't lifting weights and doing Pilates, she was eating cheese, bread and drinking wine. So of
*27:04.760- 27:12.340* :  course her body would be soft but I think we're so used to perhaps not necessarily seeing that
*27:12.340- 27:18.300* :  and enjoying it the instinct weirdly is to see it and criticise it or comment on it in some way
*27:18.300- 27:23.160* :  and people were saying God how wonderful you know she's saying that she doesn't care about her body
*27:23.160- 27:27.920* :  I was talking about the character is the character that I'm playing but of course I don't care but
*27:28.380- 27:35.560* :  it was through the conversation about playing Li and I think my point is that as women you know we
*27:35.560- 27:41.320* :  so need to be having that conversation and just celebrating just being a real shape and being soft
*27:41.320- 27:48.100* :  and maybe having a few extra rolls me Laura life is too short do you know I don't want to look
*27:48.100- 27:53.440* :  back and go why did I worry about that thing and so guess what I don't worry anymore I don't care
*27:53.480- 27:57.860* :  I'm just going to live my life I'm going to enjoy it get on with it you got one go around make the
*27:57.860- 28:04.340* :  most of it Kate Winslet South Korea's Defence Ministry says all photos and videos of soldiers
*28:04.620- 28:09.560* :  and military officials have been removed from the Armed Forces Internal Communications Network
*28:09.560- 28:15.300* :  to prevent the images being turned into deep fakes more details from our Asia Pacific Editor
*28:15.300- 28:21.920* :  Syria Hatton the ministry said 22 female soldiers have already been targeted by individuals who
*28:21.920- 28:28.400* :  used artificial intelligence to manipulate the soldier's work IDs and transform the images into
*28:28.400- 28:34.840* :  fake pornographic material now only senior personnel with special access will be allowed to view
*28:34.840- 28:41.740* :  restricted identification photos last week so launched a preliminary investigation into the
*28:41.740- 28:48.400* :  encrypted messaging platform telegram on suspicion it's helping to spread deep fake pornography
*28:48.620- 28:54.880* :  mostly targeting women and girls investigators said they'll be working with their counterparts in
*28:54.880- 29:01.200* :  France who in August arrested the head of telegram the Russian entrepreneur Pavel Dorov
*29:01.560- 29:07.860* :  Celia Hatton well across the border in the north the secretive totalitarian dictatorship is
*29:07.860- 29:13.220* :  preparing to welcome tourists towards the end of the year if you're tempted to go you will
*29:13.220- 29:18.920* :  according to past visitors probably be shown lots of churches and Buddhist temples but as former
*29:18.920- 29:26.700* :  AP bureau chief on the Korean peninsula Jean Lee told us you should be very very wary North
*29:26.700- 29:33.780* :  Korea has a socialist constitution that does formally guarantee the right to religious freedom
*29:34.400- 29:41.340* :  it is only state-sanctioned institutions where North Koreans are allowed to exercise any show
*29:41.340- 29:46.280* :  of religion and yet they want to show to the world that they do have religious institutions it is
*29:46.280- 29:51.460* :  part of their history and their culture so there are several churches Buddhist temples are
*29:51.460- 29:56.800* :  certainly on the tour that foreigners are taken on but when you go to visit these it's very hard
*29:56.800- 30:03.600* :  to tell whether these are authentic services and whether people are actually observing the religion
*30:03.600- 30:15.300* :  or if they are actors or paid to play a role as fake as that I would say that it is their role
*30:15.480- 30:21.480* :  North Koreans were there to play the role of somebody who is either a Buddhist or a Christian
*30:21.900- 30:26.540* :  and it's very hard when you're in North Korea I spent many years in North Korea it can often be
*30:26.540- 30:31.800* :  very perplexing for people who visit to try to identify and decipher what's real and what's not
*30:31.800- 30:37.340* :  we know that these people are hired to play that role but are there also times when we're not there
*30:37.340- 30:44.740* :  when you can actively say worship now what I would say is that if there are Christians for example
*30:44.740- 30:52.180* :  in North Korea they would know that any type of worship in private or underground would be extremely
*30:52.180- 30:59.720* :  dangerous this goes back to the history the heritage of American missionaries who did go to Korea when
*30:59.720- 31:06.860* :  it was one country and they created a vibrant community in Pyongyang the capital of North Korea
*31:07.360- 31:14.020* :  and I think the first leader of North Korean Kim Il Sung his family was Christian in many ways
*31:14.260- 31:19.780* :  the Kim family the ruling family of North Korea they drew and they do continue to draw on that
*31:19.780- 31:26.380* :  heritage in the making of the cult of personality around the Kim family the first leader Kim Il Sung
*31:26.380- 31:33.080* :  of North Korea did draw on what the Koreans were accustomed to they were accustomed to Christianity
*31:33.760- 31:39.880* :  to a monarchy because Korea had been ruled for many years by a rule of family what he created was
*31:39.880- 31:46.180* :  a cult of personality it is more like a monarchy but to justify their position he drew on Christianity
*31:46.320- 31:52.260* :  so so much of that language he said that they are having sent the most important guidance comes from
*31:52.260- 31:57.900* :  something called the 10 principles and as soon as I saw that I thought that is just like the 10
*31:57.900- 32:04.420* :  commandments but every North Korean knows that the most important deity in North Korea is Kim Il Sung
*32:05.080- 32:11.780* :  if I was a tourist tempted by the possibility of going and visiting North Korea what should I watch out
*32:11.780- 32:18.420* :  for they say that they're only going to start opening up in this very far northern part of North
*32:18.420- 32:23.500* :  Korea called Mt. Batu and so the main town of that area is called Sanjean and I have written
*32:23.500- 32:28.980* :  about this town calling the bathroom of North Korea because it is considered to be the birthplace
*32:28.980- 32:36.180* :  of the second leader of North Korea Kim Jong-un. Now that is a myth he was born in Siberia as far as we know
*32:36.900- 32:42.580* :  so I always caution tours to be very careful when they're in North Korea to recognize that
*32:42.580- 32:47.880* :  they're being brought on a very specific type of pilgrimage I would say that it's a very cold place
*32:47.880- 32:52.440* :  where it's winter and night months out of the year so if you're going to go bundle up do not bring
*32:52.440- 32:58.540* :  any bibles and be very very careful. Gene Lee talking to Edward Sturton
