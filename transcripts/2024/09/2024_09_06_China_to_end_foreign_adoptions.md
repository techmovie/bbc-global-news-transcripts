*01:31.360- 01:33.840* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:36.120- 01:40.640* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 6th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:41.360- 01:45.920* :  China is ending the practice of allowing children to be adopted abroad. We'll ask why.
*01:45.920- 01:50.740* :  We're in Kenya at the side of a primary school fire in which 17 boys were killed.
*01:51.440- 01:56.920* :  We look at the link between America's declining bat population and the increase in child mortality.
*01:59.080- 02:03.100* :  Also in the podcast. Who knew it's one of the more bizarre injuries we've come across in recent
*02:03.100- 02:09.380* :  seasons. There are risks that are associated with this bodily function. So what simple act was it
*02:09.400- 02:11.880* :  that put a professional footballer in the sick bay.
*02:16.580- 02:21.900* :  Many people have adopted children from China over the decades visiting the country to pick them up
*02:21.900- 02:28.360* :  and then taking them to a new home overseas. At least 150,000 children have gone abroad in the
*02:28.360- 02:32.200* :  last three decades. But now the Chinese government has had a rethink.
*02:37.820- 02:43.200* :  That's mounting a foreign ministry spokesperson saying the practice of allowing children to
*02:43.200- 02:49.280* :  be adopted overseas is coming to an end. She says this followed what she called the spirit of
*02:49.280- 02:54.120* :  relevant international conventions. And she went on to express gratitude to foreign
*02:54.120- 02:59.060* :  governments and families who'd wished to adopt Chinese children. I got more from our Asia
*02:59.060- 03:03.700* :  Pacific editor, Mickey Bristol. It's understandable to see this change because
*03:04.060- 03:09.620* :  there has been a real shift in the attitude towards a number of children in China by the Chinese
*03:09.620- 03:17.140* :  government. Over about a decade ago China ended the one child policy which had been in place
*03:17.140- 03:23.420* :  for a couple of decades itself. And that policy led to if I'm putting in sensitively an excess
*03:23.420- 03:29.220* :  of children, parents were punished if they had more than one child. And so a lot of families
*03:29.220- 03:35.760* :  were simply forced to kind of put their children up for adoption or put them into orphanages.
*03:35.760- 03:42.700* :  So that kind of created a supply, a market if you will, four overseas adoption. And the Chinese
*03:42.700- 03:49.200* :  government allowed it simply as a way to allow these excess children to kind of find loving families.
*03:49.540- 03:54.480* :  So up until now has this been a successful policy? Yeah, it depends on which point of view you're
*03:54.480- 04:00.140* :  looking at it from our memory in 1990 I was in the city of Guangzhou in southern China where a lot
*04:00.140- 04:04.820* :  of the adoptions were carried out. Now we're staying near a hotel called the White Swan.
*04:05.680- 04:10.520* :  And a lot of the parents adopting children would stay there and around the streets, the streets
*04:10.520- 04:16.440* :  around the hotel you could see really joyous and happy parents pushing their newly adopted
*04:16.440- 04:22.040* :  children around in brand new burgues and push chairs. And so from that point of view, it was a
*04:22.040- 04:27.620* :  real success because parents without children were able to adopt children. I also saw the other side
*04:27.620- 04:33.540* :  of the story though in memory in the year 2000, I went to an orphanage just outside Beijing,
*04:33.540- 04:40.920* :  a small orphanage run by an American couple. It had just a kind of a dozen children in there,
*04:40.920- 04:48.180* :  all of them girls, all of them abandoned by their parents because there is a favoritism towards
*04:48.180- 04:54.920* :  boys in China and parents simply couldn't have more than one child. So for those children it was a
*04:54.920- 05:00.340* :  real tragedy because they were separated from their family. So it just really depends on how you're
*05:00.340- 05:05.880* :  looking at this story whether you characterize it as successful or not. Indeed. What about this latest
*05:05.880- 05:11.340* :  decision though? Do we know what it'll mean for pending applications? Well there's one small
*05:11.340- 05:18.540* :  exception to the overall blanket ban on adoptions overseas and that's siblings or step children
*05:18.540- 05:23.800* :  of children who have already been adopted can still be adopted but it seems that there will be no more
*05:25.120- 05:29.120* :  apart from that, no more adoptions. So for example in America at the moment you've got several
*05:29.120- 05:36.900* :  hundred couples waiting to adopt children in China, they're probably not going to get their children.
*05:37.400- 05:43.860* :  Mickey Bristo. Both sides in Sudan's Civil War have committed abuses on a large scale which may
*05:43.860- 05:49.680* :  amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity. That is the finding of a UN-led investigation.
*05:49.680- 05:56.040* :  It recommends an arms embargo and a peacekeeping force to protect civilians. It can't come soon
*05:56.040- 05:59.900* :  enough for the millions of people who've been displaced by the conflict. Our correspondent
*05:59.900- 06:06.840* :  Noah Almagafi has gained rare access to the city of Port Sudan and a key border area in
*06:06.840- 06:12.800* :  neighbouring Chad where refugees are still flowing out as aid agencies desperately try to get in.
*06:17.180- 06:23.140* :  The sound of children collecting something that should be one of their most basic rights but here
*06:23.140- 06:30.920* :  it's a luxury. We're in a camp in Sudan where a long line of children are queuing for water.
*06:31.960- 06:37.340* :  Civil War has torn the country apart and created the world's biggest displacement crisis.
*06:42.420- 06:48.900* :  Nearby in a simple tent which is crammed with beds sits Safar Sulayman. She says she fled with her
*06:48.900- 06:54.420* :  children from one city to another trying to escape the war before arriving here in Port Sudan.
*06:57.240- 07:02.520* :  The fighting near us was so intense within the first two days two members of my family were killed.
*07:03.740- 07:06.080* :  Then I watched as two of my neighbours were cutting two.
*07:08.000- 07:13.780* :  The scale of suffering here in Sudan is unimaginable. 16 months of war have had a devastating
*07:13.820- 07:18.760* :  impact on people's lives here. Over 10 million people have had to flee their homes.
*07:23.940- 07:28.640* :  We're about to arrive by helicopter at one of the sites that's key to getting more food to
*07:28.640- 07:34.820* :  those in need in Sudan. We're landing in Adre in neighbouring Chad. It's a critical crossing point
*07:34.820- 07:43.240* :  for aid. Eight trucks are lined up and ready but across the border in Sudan is territory held by a
*07:43.240- 07:47.400* :  group called the Rapid Support Forces who are fighting the Sudanese armed forces.
*07:48.140- 07:54.580* :  For months, SAF have blocked supplies from getting inciting concerns that aid is being stolen by
*07:54.580- 08:00.780* :  the RSF and that weapons are being smuggled into. Both sides in the conflict have denied
*08:00.780- 08:08.500* :  impeding the delivery of humanitarian relief. As aid prepares to go in through this border,
*08:09.100- 08:11.660* :  families are crossing the other way to escape the war.
*08:12.600- 08:18.160* :  Bethena is one of the group of refugees who arrived five days ago from the besieged city of El Fesher.
*08:18.820- 08:24.340* :  Therefore has seen some of the worst of the fighting, claims of war crimes and horrific sexual
*08:24.340- 08:29.360* :  violence. But it was hunger that drove them to make this treacherous journey to Chad.
*08:32.240- 08:37.420* :  It's very hard, so dangerous to come here but all the shops are closed. There was no food
*08:37.420- 08:42.920* :  anymore, nothing to drink, nothing to feed my children. There is nothing to eat, there is
*08:42.920- 08:48.180* :  nowhere to hide. There were no aid agencies, she says. Her family received no help.
*08:48.680- 08:53.360* :  Aid agencies are relieved to see truckloads making their way in today but they say a constant
*08:53.360- 08:59.320* :  flow of aid is needed to deal with the horrific situation in Sudan where already one location
*08:59.360- 09:03.140* :  has been declared a famine and 13 others are at risk of famine.
*09:05.620- 09:11.180* :  Eminem Hamid, the UN's deputy secretary general, is here in Adre watching some of the aid make
*09:11.180- 09:16.560* :  its way into Sudan. She warns that if the flow of food and supplies isn't increased,
*09:16.560- 09:19.140* :  the consequences could be dire.
*09:19.480- 09:22.420* :  These are mothers, daughters, kids. People are going to die.
*09:23.260- 09:28.040* :  Simple as that. More gender-based violence than some of that will they will not recover from.
*09:28.240- 09:29.520* :  This is the ultimate suffering.
*09:29.860- 09:35.560* :  By repeatedly spurning peace talks and impeding aid, the two warring sides are effectively
*09:35.560- 09:42.040* :  putting millions of people at risk of starvation. Many of those we spoke to are hoping the world will
*09:42.040- 09:47.720* :  take notice and action before it's too late. Now I'll amagathy with that report.
*09:49.140- 09:53.760* :  It is difficult but clearly not impossible to report from at least some of the parts of Sudan
*09:53.820- 09:59.120* :  affected by the war. But in Gaza journalists have been far less successful at reporting what's
*09:59.120- 10:04.460* :  going on. That's because they've repeatedly been denied access by Israel's government for 11
*10:04.460- 10:10.660* :  months. Michelle Hussein has been speaking to CNN's chief international presenter Christian Amampur,
*10:11.060- 10:12.620* :  who's currently reporting from Ukraine.
*10:13.220- 10:17.940* :  In my experience, it's not just unusual it's unprecedented for a country that calls itself
*10:17.940- 10:24.060* :  the leading democracy in that region. Here in Dunipro and in Kiev and in Karkiv and all the places
*10:24.060- 10:29.640* :  that I've been over this last week, we have a lot more access and this country has been a democracy
*10:29.640- 10:35.560* :  for far longer than Israel has. And it's very interesting to be able to see the difference in
*10:35.560- 10:41.240* :  what we're able to tell because of the access that we're able to get. We have tried so many times,
*10:41.240- 10:46.280* :  as you know, many of us, Michelle, many in the international press have signed letters and have
*10:46.280- 10:52.080* :  tried to, you know, put our case forward to the Israeli government. And that's not to say that
*10:52.080- 10:58.000* :  we are not enormously grateful to the exceptional Gaza journalists who are risking their lives,
*10:58.000- 11:03.780* :  not just being there, but sending out the information for then many of us to be able to take their
*11:03.780- 11:08.140* :  work, hopefully crediting them as they are due and sending it out to the public.
*11:08.540- 11:13.860* :  That information, it is easier though, isn't it, for all the Israeli government to attack it because
*11:13.860- 11:20.420* :  it comes out of an area that Hamas has governed for a long time when I asked a spokesman for
*11:20.420- 11:24.720* :  the Israeli government not long ago about these restrictions. He said this is a war zone.
*11:24.720- 11:29.780* :  We're trying to get our hostages out and we will do nothing whatsoever to jeopardize the safety
*11:29.780- 11:35.200* :  of our hostages. If journalists are there, that makes the situation even more complicated.
*11:35.200- 11:40.720* :  Well, I'm not sure what he's talking about, frankly. Ever since time immemorial journalists have
*11:40.720- 11:45.960* :  been covering wars. We understand what it takes, we understand various rules of engagement,
*11:45.960- 11:51.560* :  and we understand how to operate in these areas. To your point about Gaza journalists,
*11:51.560- 11:56.700* :  that is the absolute tragedy that because they are journalists inside Gaza, because they are,
*11:57.240- 12:02.140* :  for the most part, garrisons, Palestinians, then Israel and its allies have been able to
*12:02.140- 12:08.980* :  cast aspersions on what they report. And that is incredibly unfair, incredibly, you know, wrong.
*12:09.020- 12:15.400* :  It is not a solution. We are journalists who represent democracies around the world, not least,
*12:15.400- 12:21.100* :  journalists who represent key allies of Israel without whom it would not have the economic
*12:21.100- 12:27.720* :  or military might that it has. And at the very least, we should be able to represent our constituents
*12:27.720- 12:34.200* :  around the world in our own countries by telling them what is going on and how an ally is conducting
*12:34.620- 12:39.760* :  itself in a war zone. There's no excuse for this whatsoever. I mean, here we are in Ukraine,
*12:39.760- 12:44.900* :  there are ballistic missiles being thrown around here at random and at will. We're still covering
*12:44.900- 12:49.740* :  it. There are cruise missiles. There's F-16s bombing us. I mean, hello.
*12:50.800- 12:57.720* :  That's Christian Amanpour. Our next item is an extraordinary story linking the deaths of children
*12:57.720- 13:03.920* :  in the United States to the bat population. It's because a particular ecosystem was thrown out of
*13:03.920- 13:09.240* :  balance as anna-azlem reports. Research from the United States shows a decline in the bat
*13:09.240- 13:15.180* :  population led to a surge in infant mortality rates. It sounds random, but as a result of a series
*13:15.180- 13:20.920* :  of common sense connections, a fungal disease called white nose syndrome spread across the US in 2006
*13:20.920- 13:26.180* :  killing off millions of bats. The animals eat bugs, so with natural pest control gone,
*13:26.180- 13:31.640* :  there was a 31 percent increase in the use of insecticide. The chemicals then polluted water
*13:31.640- 13:36.700* :  in air leading to nearly eight percent rise in infant mortality, a standard measure for studying
*13:36.700- 13:42.100* :  the health impacts of environmental pollution. Dr. Al Frank from the University of Chicago estimates
*13:42.100- 13:48.420* :  there were around 1,300 infant deaths between 2006 and 2017 linked to the destruction of the
*13:48.420- 13:54.020* :  bat population. This is the latest study to suggest biodiversity loss across the world is having
*13:54.020- 13:59.960* :  severe consequences for humans. In Central America, scientists say fewer amphibians and snakes have
*13:59.960- 14:06.060* :  caused spikes in malaria cases. Ecosystems are complicated things interwoven with connections
*14:06.060- 14:11.520* :  that scientists only partially understand. Dr. Frank warns that we pay attention when species
*14:11.520- 14:19.180* :  become extinct, but that's often too late. Anna-azlem. Most athletes who take out racing at elite level
*14:19.180- 14:25.520* :  focus either on sprinting or long distance running. Very few decide to do both, but that's exactly
*14:25.520- 14:32.780* :  what one Paralympian has done. Wheelchair racer Noemi Alphonse is competing for Mauritius in Paris.
*14:32.780- 14:38.700* :  She came forth in the 100 meters final on Wednesday and on Sunday she'll be competing in the marathon.
*14:39.260- 14:43.620* :  It's no surprise then that she has a picture of the comic book icon Wonder Woman on her
*14:43.620- 14:50.360* :  prosthetic leg and a matching tattoo on her arm. BBC Sport Africa's Rob Stevens went to meet her.
*14:50.620- 14:55.400* :  Everyone when they see my leg they are like oh you are Wonder Woman fan, you like movies,
*14:55.660- 15:00.700* :  but I'm not really a movie fan. She may not be a fan of films, but for Noemi Alphonse,
*15:00.700- 15:06.560* :  her life reads like a movie script. Born with a limb deficiency, she was fitted with a prosthetic leg
*15:06.560- 15:13.860* :  when she was just eight months old. Now age 28 she's a global wheelchair racing star. I really like
*15:13.860- 15:20.300* :  Wonder Woman because it shows the power that we as women we have and what we have to
*15:20.300- 15:25.700* :  overcome every time. So this is why I have Wonder Woman and my tattoo also I have the logo,
*15:25.700- 15:31.720* :  but I don't see me as a Wonder Woman. I want to be a Wonder Woman. Not a super hero, but the one
*15:31.720- 15:37.360* :  who is able to overcome everything. So this is why I like Wonder Woman. Alphonse comes to these
*15:37.360- 15:42.540* :  games having competed in Tokyo three years ago, but since then she's become World Champion in
*15:42.540- 15:49.920* :  the women's T5400 meters, winning gold in Kobe, Japan in May. It was a hugely emotional moment for her.
*15:50.160- 15:55.380* :  It was a dream come true. When I scream at the end, everyone knows I'm a nice person. I don't really
*15:55.380- 16:03.740* :  shout. I was overwhelmed just realizing what I was able to do during the middle ceremony I cried.
*16:03.740- 16:08.460* :  It was really a nice time for me. Alphonse is one of six competitors from Mauritius,
*16:08.460- 16:13.960* :  taken part in the Paris Paralympics, an encouraging number considering that ten African nations have
*16:13.960- 16:19.460* :  not been able to send anyone to France, and nine others only have one representative. Alphonse
*16:19.460- 16:23.680* :  credits the government's sports ministry for their support, but she says that as a world champion,
*16:23.680- 16:28.520* :  she's well aware of the pressure on her shoulders now to bring back a medal. I know now the
*16:28.680- 16:35.360* :  title that I have coming to Paris is heavy because we have a media pressure in Mauritius everyone
*16:35.360- 16:40.960* :  when they see me. It's like, yeah, we will win the gold medal, but all I said, I am a world champion now.
*16:41.080- 16:48.040* :  That doesn't mean I will be a Paralympic champion. So we are six athletes here. We have to be equal
*16:48.040- 16:52.220* :  with everyone. No favorite athletes, Mauritius as one.
*16:54.840- 17:00.600* :  Coming up. It's a relief that someone is being held accountable, but at the end of the day,
*17:00.600- 17:07.260* :  it doesn't change that Jordan's not here. A landmark case in the growing crime of sex torsion.

*18:26.860- 18:31.240* :  Over a hundred other children were forced to shelter under their beds as the flames spread.
*18:31.660- 18:36.360* :  Some of them were badly burned. President William Ruto has called the incident horrific
*18:36.360- 18:41.960* :  and devastating. I spoke to our Africa correspondent Barbara Pettarsha, who's at the hospital
*18:42.320- 18:46.500* :  in the county of Nieri. This is the hospital where the trauma victims are going to be brought.
*18:46.500- 18:50.640* :  There were 14 children who were quite severely burned, who have also been brought to hospital.
*18:50.640- 18:55.620* :  So you get the sense there of what sort of recovery is going to be needed, not just from the
*18:55.620- 18:59.660* :  burns, but also from the psychological terror of these children who were caught in the fire
*19:00.060- 19:06.500* :  overnight, which started around 11 p.m. around between 11 and midnight in the boys dormitory.
*19:06.500- 19:13.440* :  156 boys were sleeping there between the ages of 9 and 13 and golfed by flames. Some of them
*19:13.440- 19:18.280* :  tried to escape the fire by crawling underneath the beds and it took a while to put it out.
*19:18.280- 19:23.400* :  The firefighters were delayed because of a muddy road, but neighbors came on the scene. People
*19:23.400- 19:27.660* :  around as well as officials and there were quite a few people in the end who were working to put
*19:27.660- 19:32.940* :  out the fire and trying to rescue the boys, most of whom were rescued, but tragically a good
*19:32.940- 19:39.220* :  number were killed, burned beyond recognition and some severely burned. So obviously an investigation
*19:39.220- 19:44.300* :  is going to get underway into what caused this. Are there any theories yet?
*19:45.140- 19:49.700* :  There are no theories about this particular school burning yet. No, that's still under investigation,
*19:49.740- 19:55.140* :  but has to be said that the burning of boarding schools or fires at boarding schools in Kenya
*19:55.600- 20:00.860* :  is actually rather common, usually put down to arson. Somebody starts the fire and often it has
*20:00.860- 20:05.100* :  turned out to be the students themselves, sometimes protesting heavy workloads or
*20:05.340- 20:10.280* :  poor living conditions or for other reasons. So it has happened before and we've had casualties
*20:10.280- 20:15.320* :  before. We don't know if that's the reason this fire started. The president has said there
*20:15.320- 20:20.140* :  must be a thorough investigation and that those responsible must be held to account and investigative
*20:20.140- 20:26.260* :  team has already started doing its work. But for the parents, the most immediate concern and gruesome
*20:26.260- 20:30.080* :  concern is just to find children. Some of them still not sure what happened to their child,
*20:30.440- 20:34.740* :  which hospital exactly they've been taken to and also the remains haven't all been identified.
*20:34.740- 20:40.320* :  So for them, the issue is very immediate, very tragic and very much about possibly having lost
*20:40.320- 20:46.560* :  somebody they love very much. Barbara Pettasha in Kenya. People are bracing themselves in southern
*20:46.560- 20:53.260* :  China and Vietnam for super typhoon Yagi. It's hitting the island of Hainan as we record this
*20:53.260- 20:58.920* :  podcast and it looks set to be the strongest storm there in over a decade. At least 13 people
*20:58.920- 21:04.600* :  were killed in flooding and landslides as Yagi swept through the Philippines. Laura Bicca is our
*21:04.600- 21:10.740* :  correspondent in Beijing. It's doubled in strength after it reached havoc in the northern Philippines.
*21:10.740- 21:16.020* :  Meteorologists are telling us it's got winds of up to around 240 kilometres an hour,
*21:16.520- 21:22.720* :  but I think what we're looking at is the island of Hainan. Now this is like a popular tourist spot
*21:23.280- 21:29.500* :  in China. It's got beautiful sandy beaches, lovely coastlines, but obviously that will make it
*21:29.500- 21:36.160* :  quite vulnerable to typhoons. The sweeping round of the eye, the winds that are sweeping round the
*21:36.220- 21:42.240* :  eye, are also scheduled to hit Guangdong. Now the important thing about Guangdong is it's
*21:42.480- 21:47.060* :  once was known as the factory of the world, it's China's manufacturing hub and it's already
*21:47.060- 21:53.480* :  suffered from a number of floods this year. China has dispatched a task force right across southern
*21:53.480- 21:59.120* :  China to prepare for floods and to prepare for any potential typhoon-related damage.
*21:59.480- 22:03.640* :  An extraordinary coincidence today, we've heard from China's Weather Service that last month
*22:04.200- 22:09.480* :  was the country's hottest August in more than six decades. The EU is saying that the past three
*22:09.480- 22:15.220* :  months, the hottest June and August ever recorded. These changes in weather patterns
*22:15.960- 22:20.000* :  mean that China particularly and those other countries in that area are going to have to think
*22:20.260- 22:25.000* :  long and hard about where to build things in the future, aren't there? Are there plans for relocating
*22:25.000- 22:30.400* :  things, do you think? China is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world. It
*22:30.400- 22:36.440* :  suffers from a real water crisis. First of all, during the one season, it has too much water,
*22:36.440- 22:42.600* :  and it all falls in the same place and at the same time. Then, of course, it has huge dry seasons,
*22:42.600- 22:48.880* :  massive droughts. It has this problem between drought and between flood. Meanwhile,
*22:48.880- 22:56.020* :  it has a country that is thirsty for water. It doesn't have enough water in long term to supply
*22:56.020- 23:00.600* :  most of its population, and this is something that it's having to grapple with. Not only
*23:00.600- 23:05.680* :  that you've just heard the figures there, the annual climate blue book that you're referring to
*23:05.680- 23:10.520* :  is released by the China Meteorological Administration. It's warning that temperatures across
*23:10.520- 23:17.460* :  the country could rise by 1.7 to 2.8 degrees Celsius within the next 30 years, and it's eastern China,
*23:17.460- 23:22.740* :  so it's those coastal areas and that northwest region of Xinjiang, which suffers from drought,
*23:22.740- 23:29.680* :  will suffer the most. Laura Bicca. Sextortion is a rapidly growing cybercrime.
*23:29.840- 23:35.140* :  People are targeted by scammers pretending to be someone else who's romantically interested in them.
*23:35.560- 23:40.720* :  Then, they try to get the victim to send explicit images of themselves, and if they do, they extort
*23:40.720- 23:47.060* :  money from them. Now, the US has just had its first successful prosecution of two men from Nigeria,
*23:47.060- 23:52.500* :  where the crime is particularly prevalent. The brothers have been sentenced to 17 and a half
*23:52.500- 23:58.600* :  years in prison for a scam that led an American teenager, Jordan De May, to kill himself.
*23:59.120- 24:03.160* :  Our cyber correspondent, Joe Tidey, told Catherine Biara Hangar, what happened?
*24:03.820- 24:08.800* :  He was befriended on Instagram by an attractive girl, his age, she thought,
*24:08.800- 24:15.340* :  called Danny, and they started talking, and she was flirting with him, and then she sort of
*24:15.760- 24:20.740* :  sent some sexual images and coaxed him into sending some intimate pictures of himself.
*24:20.740- 24:26.380* :  And then, that's when the two brothers came clean and said, actually, we are not who you think we are.
*24:26.900- 24:30.220* :  We are scammers from Nigeria, and we want you to pay us.
*24:30.640- 24:36.520* :  And over the course of the next few hours, they managed to get Jordan to send them hundreds of dollars.
*24:36.840- 24:40.020* :  It's all he had. He worked him at Donalds, and that was sort of all his savings.
*24:40.060- 24:44.680* :  And then, when he said, I can't send you any more, please don't share the pictures with anybody.
*24:44.700- 24:48.060* :  Don't send them around to my friends and family like they were threatening.
*24:48.520- 24:50.340* :  He said, if you do this, I will kill myself.
*24:50.340- 24:55.740* :  And then, the message records showed that the Nigerian said, good, do that, or we'll make you do it.
*24:56.360- 24:59.860* :  And then, of course, we know that he did take his life that night.
*24:59.860- 25:05.360* :  And it was in 2022, and it's taken a long time for the police and obviously the family
*25:05.360- 25:08.360* :  who've been going through this whole thing to see justice.
*25:08.920- 25:11.360* :  And Joe, let's play listeners a bit of this interview.
*25:11.420- 25:15.860* :  This is what Jordan Demay's mother had to say about the outcome of this legal case.
*25:16.600- 25:19.780* :  It's a relief that someone is being held accountable,
*25:20.820- 25:24.440* :  but at the end of the day, it doesn't change that Jordan's not here.
*25:24.660- 25:31.580* :  It's really a struggle because there's no good that is coming out of this situation
*25:32.440- 25:37.780* :  for my family or for the individual's responsible's family.
*25:38.780- 25:45.240* :  The best thing that can come of this is that it's setting an example for the people who
*25:46.060- 25:49.700* :  are doing this to other individuals that you can be caught.
*25:49.940- 25:51.720* :  It's not a nameless crime.
*25:52.840- 25:57.320* :  And hopefully that deters them from continuing to go after our children.
*25:58.240- 26:02.740* :  And it's also creating awareness for kids that this is what's going on.
*26:02.740- 26:09.040* :  It's continuing to rise and they need to be aware of who they are talking to on social media.
*26:09.720- 26:11.620* :  Yes, Jordan Demay's mother there.
*26:11.880- 26:15.580* :  And Joe, how significant has this legal trial been?
*26:15.920- 26:20.580* :  It's been hugely significant because, of course, the Jordan Demay story partly thanks to the
*26:20.580- 26:24.680* :  woman you heard there, Jen Booter, his mother has been very, very high profile.
*26:24.680- 26:27.880* :  She has become something of a campaigner on TikTok.
*26:27.880- 26:31.420* :  For example, telling people, telling young people about what happened to her son.
*26:31.420- 26:37.340* :  She's done every single news outlet in the US and been trying to push the awareness of sex
*26:37.340- 26:41.700* :  torsion because it is the fastest growing crime, cybercrime against young people.
*26:42.240- 26:45.820* :  There have been something like 27 suicides in the last two years.
*26:46.060- 26:47.180* :  And that's in the US alone.
*26:47.260- 26:50.740* :  We know, of course, there's two others in the UK recently as well.
*26:51.400- 26:54.180* :  And the case has been watched by people all over the world.
*26:54.180- 26:59.460* :  And particularly, of course, people in Nigeria, they've been trying to make sure that the
*26:59.460- 27:05.260* :  Nigerian Yahoo boys, as they call them, this culture of people using cybercrime to earn a living.
*27:05.260- 27:08.160* :  They've been trying to get the story out that this can happen.
*27:08.300- 27:11.780* :  People are killing themselves because of your activity in your actions.
*27:16.020- 27:18.200* :  Now, let's end this podcast with sneezes.
*27:18.200- 27:23.120* :  They can be loud, they often come in threes, and sometimes they can be bad for your health.
*27:23.600- 27:25.960* :  As one professional footballer can attest to.
*27:26.300- 27:31.200* :  Nigerian Victor Ade Boyejo, who plays for the English team Balkan wanderers,
*27:31.200- 27:37.940* :  Mr Game Midweek, after suffering an unusual injury caused by what's been described as a hefty sneeze.
*27:38.060- 27:43.900* :  Club manager Ian Everett says they're waiting for scan results after he felt a crack in between his ribs.
*27:43.900- 27:47.900* :  He told reporters Victor is powerful, even his sneezes are powerful.
*27:48.480- 27:50.000* :  So how dangerous can they be?
*27:50.000- 27:54.080* :  Rick Edwards has been speaking to Adam Taylor, who's a professor of anatomy.
*27:54.520- 27:57.760* :  Who knew it's one of the more bizarre injuries we've come across in recent seasons?
*27:58.400- 28:01.680* :  You know, there's everybody knows sneezing is just one of those things that happens every day.
*28:01.680- 28:05.620* :  But there are risks that are associated with this bodily function.
*28:05.940- 28:11.360* :  So is it more risky, the sort of more powerful you are, as his manager sort of suggests there?
*28:11.540- 28:16.180* :  It's entirely possible. I mean, we don't typically see sneezing-related injuries
*28:16.180- 28:23.940* :  in young athletes, you know, the demographic of people we typically see with these kind of injuries
*28:23.940- 28:28.380* :  are usually elderly because they've got weaker or lower bone mass.
*28:28.600- 28:32.940* :  And they're, you know, 8% of injuries do occur in men in and around their 40s,
*28:32.960- 28:37.580* :  but typically the most severe injuries such as broken ribs are seen in elderly people.
*28:37.580- 28:43.700* :  So, you know, there is that element is his manager described to Victor being a very strong guy.
*28:43.700- 28:47.940* :  And that's, you know, we have to think about that, that his muscle force and the power that he's
*28:47.940- 28:52.800* :  generating, even from those small muscles in and around your ribs and your chest are probably far greater
*28:52.800- 28:57.980* :  than, you know, yours or mine are. And so there is that risk, you know, in people with lean body
*28:57.980- 29:02.300* :  mass, high muscle percentage, that they're exerting a force that's far greater on their
*29:02.300- 29:04.940* :  boney architecture than you or I could ever dream of doing.
*29:05.340- 29:10.420* :  But it is better to sneeze than the not sneezes, isn't it? You want to get the stuff out?
*29:10.420- 29:14.560* :  That's the point that sneezes. Yeah, absolutely. Right. You know, the body sneezes to clear
*29:15.580- 29:20.580* :  potentially dangerous material, you know, dust particles, viruses, bacteria out of our airways
*29:20.600- 29:25.260* :  and out of our passages to protect our delicate lung tissues. And, you know, there are, as we've
*29:25.260- 29:29.540* :  discussed, there are risks with sneezing, but there's also probably bigger risks with holding
*29:29.540- 29:34.700* :  sneezes in. Yeah, just very quickly, yes or no, is it true that if you sneeze with your eyes open,
*29:34.700- 29:40.060* :  your eyes can pop out? That's fake. That's that one sorted then. Adam Taylor speaking to Rick Edwards.
*29:42.380- 29:46.000* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast

*30:52.280- 30:56.500* :  The stories they don't want told. I was one of many people that were victims who was used.
*30:56.720- 31:01.400* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity holding the powerful to account.
