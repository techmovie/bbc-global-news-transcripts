*01:41.820- 01:47.100* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday 11 September.
*01:47.100- 01:51.020* :  The top diplomats from the US and Britain make a joint visit to Ukraine.
*01:51.020- 01:55.360* :  But will they approve the use of long-range missiles inside Russia?
*01:56.140- 02:00.820* :  Tens of thousands of people flee their homes in the Vietnamese capital as the red river
*02:00.820- 02:06.860* :  bursts its banks. And doctors in Congo tell the BBC they are struggling to contain the outbreak of
*02:06.860- 02:15.500* :  an outbreak. Also in the podcast, a snap poll suggests Kamala Harris won Tuesday's presidential
*02:15.500- 02:22.000* :  debate against Donald Trump, but will it change anyone's views? Kamala Harris held her own,
*02:22.000- 02:27.680* :  but she did a really good job. He's still able to lead a country. In his strong leader,
*02:28.160- 02:31.020* :  everybody says what they want to say. I think there was a lot of lives last night.
*02:31.720- 02:37.080* :  And Brazil's former president, Jaya Bolsonaro, is awarded more than $2,000 in damages
*02:37.560- 02:39.180* :  after a dispute about furniture.
*02:45.060- 02:49.440* :  The foreign ministers of the US and Britain have arrived in Kiev in a joint show of support
*02:49.440- 02:54.840* :  for Ukraine. Anthony Blinken and David Lamy will discuss Ukrainian demands to relax restrictions
*02:54.840- 03:00.760* :  on the use of long-range weapons against targets inside Russia. The US is considering ending
*03:00.760- 03:07.480* :  its ban after accusing Iran of a dramatic escalation by providing Russia with short-range ballistic
*03:07.480- 03:14.100* :  missiles. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that Russia would retaliate to any change in
*03:19.120- 03:24.560* :  policy. The response will be appropriate. It will be appropriate. You know, there's no need to
*03:24.560- 03:29.940* :  wait for any responses everywhere. Special military operation is the answer to all these activities.
*03:30.680- 03:35.240* :  Well, on his arrival in Ukraine, the British Foreign Secretary announced that the UK had sanctioned
*03:35.240- 03:40.560* :  10 ships of Russia's Shadow Fleet, which Britain says is used to avoid western sanctions.
*03:40.620- 03:44.980* :  I heard more about the visit to Kiev from our correspondent there, Nick Beek.
*03:45.460- 03:51.940* :  It represents the first joint trip overseas by a British Foreign Secretary and their American
*03:51.940- 03:58.180* :  counterpart in more than a decade. The fact that they've got the train together from Poland,
*03:58.180- 04:03.120* :  taking the long journey to the capital Kiev where I'm talking to you from now. They say this
*04:03.120- 04:08.380* :  is emblematic of the ongoing support for Ukraine. But I think for President Zelensky,
*04:08.660- 04:15.040* :  he wants to see and hear about a change in American and British policy, specifically on the issue
*04:15.040- 04:19.660* :  of long-range missiles, because so far, even though the Ukrainians have been supplied with
*04:20.080- 04:23.880* :  British and American long-range missiles, they haven't been given the permission to use them.
*04:23.880- 04:28.380* :  President Zelensky says they're absolutely necessary to strike further into Russia,
*04:28.380- 04:34.820* :  so that they can take out Russian airfields, and specifically the bombers, the planes that take
*04:34.820- 04:40.960* :  off and then cause havoc over the skies of Ukraine. What is the prospect of a change in policy?
*04:41.460- 04:47.800* :  It could well be on the way, and I think this is largely down to what President Biden has said in
*04:47.800- 04:53.400* :  the past 24 hours, saying that his administration was working that out now, when asked whether he'd
*04:53.400- 04:59.760* :  be prepared to change his policy. So it may well be that if there is a change, both the Americans
*04:59.760- 05:05.440* :  and the British announce this together, which of course would be really pleasing to President
*05:05.440- 05:11.060* :  Zelensky after months and months of saying this was absolutely necessary. And it appears to be linked
*05:11.060- 05:19.260* :  to this intelligence about Iran supplying Russia with new missiles. What more is known about that?
*05:19.680- 05:23.660* :  The argument for not giving permission until now has been that there may be an escalation.
*05:23.660- 05:29.440* :  People mindful that President Putin has said that those countries giving permission to the Ukrainians
*05:29.440- 05:34.960* :  to use long-range missiles that would hit deep into Russia, the responsibility would lie with
*05:34.960- 05:41.020* :  the Americans and the British. What seems to have changed is this announcement by Anthony Blinken
*05:41.020- 05:47.700* :  on Tuesday that he says intelligent shows that the Iranians are now supplying short-range missiles
*05:48.380- 05:55.380* :  to Russia. He says these will be used on the battlefield and basically they will allow the Russians
*05:55.380- 06:02.620* :  to keep their own longer-range missiles to hit places further into Ukraine itself. So it could
*06:02.620- 06:08.680* :  well be that this development has basically crystallized this change in policy if it comes from
*06:08.680- 06:14.800* :  the Americans, but certainly that other European countries, the UK, Germany, and France have
*06:14.800- 06:20.540* :  described that the prospector, as the Americans say, the hard intelligence they have that these
*06:20.540- 06:27.140* :  missiles are being sent to Russia as something which is posing an increased threat to security in
*06:27.140- 06:30.440* :  the whole of Europe. Nick Beak in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev.
*06:31.080- 06:37.780* :  The previous US election debate in June didn't go well for the Democrats, with Joe Biden forced
*06:37.780- 06:43.880* :  to quit as the presidential nominee. So how did his successity when she debated Donald Trump on
*06:43.880- 06:50.200* :  Tuesday night? According to a snap opinion poll, Kamala Harris came out on top, putting the Republican
*06:50.200- 06:55.260* :  former president on the defensive, so much so that he even made a surprise appearance in the
*06:55.260- 07:00.160* :  spin-room afterwards to try to regain the initiative. Our correspondent, Gary O'Donney,
*07:00.160- 07:01.960* :  who watched the debate unfold in Philadelphia.
*07:07.520- 07:11.200* :  Not just the first debate for these two as presidential candidates,
*07:11.200- 07:16.340* :  but the first time these two have ever met, as they came to debate in Philadelphia,
*07:16.380- 07:20.100* :  the so-called city of brotherly love, not so much.
*07:20.340- 07:22.880* :  She's a Marxist. Everybody knows she's a Marxist.
*07:23.080- 07:27.200* :  People start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom.
*07:27.400- 07:31.780* :  But soon they got onto issues such as immigration, a key concern for voters,
*07:32.260- 07:38.240* :  a one that could be a strength for the former president, though he chose to focus on unsubstantiated
*07:38.240- 07:45.840* :  claims about migrants eating people's pets. In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that
*07:45.840- 07:51.140* :  came in, they're eating the cats, they're eating the vice president, but scared to contain herself.
*07:51.300- 07:56.440* :  Of the people that live there. Moderators attempted to fact check the former president
*07:56.440- 08:02.440* :  on several occasions during the debate, not least when he had this to say on the contentious
*08:02.440- 08:07.860* :  issue of abortion. Will she allow abortion in the eighth month, ninth month, seventh month?
*08:08.220- 08:13.000* :  Okay, would you do that? There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby
*08:13.000- 08:18.300* :  after it's born. The economy was always going to be a hugely important issue.
*08:18.300- 08:23.800* :  It's what most Americans really care about. She is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden.
*08:23.800- 08:27.960* :  I don't know the Donald Trump attempted to tie Kamala Harris to her boss.
*08:30.220- 08:35.580* :  The vice president talked about her economic plans, but not perhaps as much as her supporters
*08:35.580- 08:39.520* :  would have liked. On international affairs, though, she was scathing.
*08:39.520- 08:44.180* :  World leaders are laughing at Donald Trump. I have talked with military leaders,
*08:44.180- 08:50.200* :  some of whom work with you, and they say you're a disgrace. Donald Trump hit back by attacking
*08:50.200- 08:55.040* :  the chaotic withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, and again claimed,
*08:55.620- 08:57.900* :  Ukraine war wouldn't have happened under him.
*08:57.940- 09:02.160* :  We're playing with World War III, and we have a president that we don't even know if he's
*09:02.380- 09:06.920* :  where is our president. Donald Trump ending that report from Gary O'Donohy.
*09:07.540- 09:12.720* :  Well, the polarized nature of American politics means even families there are divided.
*09:12.780- 09:18.920* :  Derek Sengano from Michigan, for example, is a Trump voter. His sister Tammy is a Democrat.
*09:19.640- 09:24.060* :  Their brother David is an independent, but like millions of Americans, they were all glued
*09:24.060- 09:29.620* :  to the Harris Trump debate. So what did they make of it? The BBC's Sarah Montague has been
*09:29.620- 09:35.480* :  speaking to them first Tammy. I felt that Kamala Harris held her own.
*09:35.520- 09:42.340* :  I thought she did a really good job, especially not engaging with Donald Trump too much,
*09:42.340- 09:47.200* :  as far as arguing and stuff like that. Well, I've got to go to Derek on this.
*09:47.600- 09:52.260* :  There were a lot of questions for people ahead of this debate, wanting to know more about her,
*09:52.260- 09:57.660* :  because she's the unknown, relatively unknown candidate. What did you think of her as a Trump
*09:57.660- 10:02.800* :  supporter? Well, I think Tammy and I must have been watching a different debate last night,
*10:02.800- 10:09.040* :  because she did go after Trump several different times. She didn't really pinpoint anything or
*10:09.040- 10:15.340* :  say anything. She was really going to do all I remember her really saying is let's forget the
*10:15.340- 10:20.620* :  last four years and move on. But in a way, you two aren't the surprising one. David, you have
*10:20.620- 10:26.200* :  often been on the fence in the past. What did you see in terms of how, whether it will influence
*10:26.200- 10:35.160* :  your vote, come November? I feel that the very first question that they asked the VP was,
*10:35.560- 10:41.380* :  are we better off four years ago? And she could not answer that. So right there, no accomplishments.
*10:41.420- 10:48.980* :  I mean, the media made her, nobody knew of her, and also now it's just so biased when it comes
*10:48.980- 10:53.300* :  to that. There's so much hatred still in the US between the right and the left.
*10:53.640- 10:58.340* :  And does that make you want to vote for Donald Trump? We're in an incredible unique situation where
*10:58.340- 11:04.940* :  we have, we've seen both of the candidates in office. And for me, life was better under Trump,
*11:05.640- 11:11.800* :  which suggests you will be voting for Trump. You know what? I'm still, I honestly, you know,
*11:11.800- 11:18.100* :  I'm independent. You know, you get what's stopping you because I know it's not like I don't like
*11:19.200- 11:24.900* :  I like him better than what I see what's been happening in the last three and a half years.
*11:24.900- 11:30.540* :  It's amazing that David and Lindsey had all these fact checks right away for Trump, and they didn't
*11:30.540- 11:35.720* :  fact check her at all. The moderators. Yeah, the matter, it's, it's just crazy. I mean,
*11:35.980- 11:41.600* :  they didn't tell me how do you respond to that? They didn't need to fact check her because she was
*11:41.600- 11:49.080* :  telling the truth. She was much more positive. And Donald Trump was saying things that were
*11:49.080- 11:54.700* :  very, very negative and pretty off the cuff as far as, you know, she answered the abortion.
*11:54.700- 12:02.720* :  She answered the question regarding January 6th. He had no answer. He wouldn't, he sat there and
*12:02.720- 12:08.600* :  did not say he would change a thing that happened on that day. And that's just amazing to me.
*12:09.000- 12:13.220* :  Derek, can I ask you about some of the things that Donald Trump says, whether it's about
*12:13.220- 12:20.900* :  immigrant-seating dogs and cats and family pets or about January the 6th or, or indeed abortion,
*12:21.640- 12:26.220* :  what do you, are there, are there moments where you think, I'm not sure I believe him on that,
*12:26.220- 12:31.600* :  but I mean, you know, we're hearing about the fact checking, but it does it worry you?
*12:32.160- 12:37.960* :  No, I, you still be able to lead a country. You need a strong leader, you know, and you have
*12:37.960- 12:43.600* :  these third world countries that they do not speak with women, even if they're in a leadership
*12:43.600- 12:48.260* :  position. It's just the way the world is. Am I right in understanding that's what you're saying,
*12:48.260- 12:53.700* :  that you think the US would be weaker if it had a female president? Not anything against them,
*12:53.700- 13:00.180* :  but that's the way the world is. Tammy? I don't agree that our nation would be weaker with a female
*13:00.180- 13:07.440* :  president, especially this female president. She seems to have a lot of leadership skills,
*13:07.440- 13:14.480* :  and she's very, very smart. So I can't imagine our country being weaker because of that.
*13:14.800- 13:19.500* :  I can imagine our country being weaker with someone in office like Donald Trump,
*13:19.500- 13:26.100* :  who other countries don't take seriously. David, has your relationships within the family
*13:26.100- 13:32.780* :  been affected at all? No, I mean, you did say David, so all my siblings just be quiet for a minute.
*13:32.780- 13:39.700* :  Can I have a little talk with Sarah? Just me and Sarah? No, I mean, we're still close. I mean,
*13:39.700- 13:44.380* :  we get together as much as we can, and we typically, I mean, I don't think we talk politics as much
*13:44.380- 13:50.260* :  as we used to because there's really nothing. I try to avoid it. The St. Gano family from Michigan,
*13:50.260- 13:54.960* :  and for more on last night's debate, check out the global story, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*13:55.660- 13:59.480* :  Well, the election itself is now fast approaching, and ahead of polling day,
*13:59.480- 14:05.160* :  we'll be doing a special podcast in collaboration with our friends at BBC America. So if you have
*14:05.160- 14:09.960* :  any questions you want answered by our team in the US, please send them in. You can email global
*14:09.960- 14:17.120* :  podcast at bbc.co.uk or tweet us at global news pod. And if possible, please record your question
*14:17.120- 14:25.020* :  in a voice note. Thank you. Officials in northern Vietnam say almost 180 people have now died
*14:25.020- 14:30.660* :  after a super typhoon hit at the weekend. Yagi, the country's most powerful storm in 30 years,
*14:30.660- 14:36.800* :  continues to bring heavy rainfall, landslides and flooding. Vietnam's weather bureau chief said today
*14:36.800- 14:42.640* :  the red river in Hanoi had hit its highest level in 20 years. I got the latest from our correspondent
*14:42.640- 14:48.020* :  in the region, Rupert Wingfield Hayes. It's continuing to get worse, despite the fact that
*14:48.020- 14:52.780* :  Typhoon Yagi actually passed over Vietnam two days ago and has broken up in the mountains over
*14:53.860- 14:58.140* :  the hours. The amount of rainfall that is dropped over northern Vietnam means that flood levels
*14:58.140- 15:02.660* :  along the red river valley are continuing to rise. In fact, in Hanoi in the capital, we've heard
*15:02.660- 15:07.780* :  that they've evacuated around 16,000 residents from low-lying areas of the city close to the river
*15:08.280- 15:13.760* :  and that flooding in those areas is now at about a meter. And the red river level is continuing to rise.
*15:13.760- 15:18.220* :  So it's a very serious situation. People there are saying they haven't seen floods like this for
*15:18.220- 15:27.060* :  20 or even 30 years and there is a dam upstream in the red river valley that is above danger levels
*15:27.060- 15:31.460* :  and is continuing to rise. So they're going to have to release more to form that dam which is
*15:31.460- 15:36.640* :  going to exacerbate the flooding further downstream. So it's still a very critical situation for
*15:36.640- 15:41.620* :  much of northern Vietnam. Yeah, people desperate for help even putting out please on social media.
*15:42.220- 15:47.360* :  That's right. I mean, what's going on down in Haifong and Hanoi in the big cities, but there's also
*15:47.360- 15:51.800* :  what's going on a completely different story up in the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam
*15:51.800- 15:57.660* :  further inland and there villages have been hit by landslides. People are cut off. The roads are
*15:57.660- 16:02.560* :  gone. The electricity is gone and so there's a completely different rescue operation going
*16:02.560- 16:08.420* :  on there. Yesterday there was a large landslide that buried a whole village killing 16 people in one
*16:08.420- 16:15.200* :  village and rescue teams are really just struggling to get in and get people out. And this is the third
*16:15.200- 16:21.160* :  super typhoon to hit the region in a pretty short time. Is there more bad weather on the way?
*16:21.760- 16:25.040* :  Well, the typhoon season is far from over. The typhoon season now in Southeast Asia goes
*16:25.040- 16:31.400* :  well into November, even into December. We've had typhoon gamey in July, which hit Taiwan,
*16:31.400- 16:36.920* :  which was a super typhoon, biggest in a long time to hit Taiwan. Then there was typhoon Shan Shan,
*16:36.920- 16:42.560* :  which was also a huge system that went over the whole of Japan at the end of last month.
*16:42.920- 16:48.920* :  And now typhoon Yagi smashing into both southern China and then into Vietnam. So these typhoons,
*16:48.920- 16:53.140* :  it's not that typhoons are getting more numerous in the western Pacific, but their size
*16:53.500- 16:57.440* :  is growing. And we're so is seeing more of these super typhoons coming out of the western
*16:57.440- 17:00.840* :  Pacific. And they're very, very difficult to deal with, not just because of the winds,
*17:01.200- 17:04.480* :  but just the enormous amount of precipitation that they carry with them.
*17:05.320- 17:11.600* :  Rupert Wingfield haze. Over the past few days, survivors of a bus crash in Australia last summer have
*17:11.600- 17:16.900* :  given emotional testimony in court. Ten people died while traveling back from a wedding in the
*17:16.900- 17:22.820* :  Hunter Valley wine region in New South Wales. Some survivors have life changing injuries. Many of
*17:22.820- 17:28.200* :  them were in court to watch the moment the driver, Brett Button, was sentenced to 32 years in prison.
*17:28.200- 17:33.660* :  The judge said that in his 50 year career, he'd never seen a case which had caused such extraordinary
*17:33.660- 17:39.500* :  devastation to so many individuals and families. Our Sydney correspondent Katie Watson has the details.
*17:40.240- 17:47.080* :  It was an event that shocked Australia, a country that has a very, has very safe safety record
*17:47.080- 17:55.720* :  when it comes to driving. What we heard was Brett Button was driving 35 wedding guests back home
*17:56.220- 18:00.980* :  after an event in Hunter Valley. And Hunter Valley is a few hours away from here in Sydney. It's
*18:00.980- 18:07.420* :  a very popular place for weddings. It's where there are a lot of vineyards. And he had he was a driver
*18:07.420- 18:15.440* :  who was dependent on opioids. He had taken tramadol, which can lead to fogginess. And he had also
*18:15.440- 18:20.880* :  been accused of driving dangerously. There are some passengers had said that they were concerned
*18:20.880- 18:27.220* :  about the speed he was driving. And he lost control at a roundabout. And the bus turned over and
*18:27.220- 18:35.200* :  slid along a guardrail. Now all 35 passengers on the coach were there were ten who died and 25
*18:35.420- 18:43.020* :  injured. Everybody was affected apart from the driver himself. And the last few days we've
*18:43.020- 18:48.540* :  heard testimony from those survivors who talked about the grief and the pain that they're going
*18:48.540- 18:54.520* :  through. It's been a very emotional few days in court ahead of the sentencing that we have just
*18:54.520- 19:03.060* :  heard. Katie Watson. And still to come on the global news podcast. The potential of it is huge.
*19:03.080- 19:06.620* :  I, you know, it's also running across all the network with the American networks right now,
*19:06.620- 19:10.120* :  even though we just had the debate. So her timing is as always impeccable.
*19:10.600- 19:15.320* :  Could Taylor Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris influenced young female swing voters?

*20:41.820- 20:46.620* :  Healthcare workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo have told the BBC they are struggling to
*20:46.620- 20:51.840* :  cope with the inbox outbreak in the east of the country. Medical staff in South Kivu,
*20:51.840- 20:56.340* :  the worst affected region in the world, say they are running out of supplies and have no
*20:56.340- 21:02.480* :  information about when they'll get vaccines. The BBC's Simeijon Oshou has been given rare access
*21:02.480- 21:06.540* :  to an inbox treatment centre in South Kivu where infections are rising.
*21:11.080- 21:15.900* :  The cries of babies are resounding here. As the number of infections rise,
*21:16.520- 21:18.620* :  the age of the patients gets younger.
*21:20.360- 21:27.640* :  Mourhula Balumi is the youngest inbox case at Lueros Community Hospital at only four weeks old.
*21:28.100- 21:33.000* :  It's an agonising ordeal for first time mom, 18-year-old Faraja Rukhara.
*21:34.220- 21:41.380* :  It's sad to see my first born suffering from this strange disease. I have a lot of pain in my heart.
*21:42.200- 21:44.220* :  It's a very bad and dangerous disease.
*21:50.040- 21:54.780* :  Mpox has caused many to lose that appetite. They have become malnourished.
*21:56.620- 22:02.140* :  Yvette Cabrilla was relieved after her 10-month-old daughter, Aminipa, recovered from the disease,
*22:02.880- 22:07.120* :  only to get ill herself. As babies pass on Mpox to their parents,
*22:07.240- 22:10.160* :  there's fear of a new wave of infections.
*22:13.760- 22:17.180* :  This is the first time many here have encountered Mpox.
*22:17.820- 22:21.880* :  Butchers Kachira rushed her three-year-old granddaughter here in a panic.
*22:24.360- 22:27.920* :  I just saw the child get sick. I didn't even know the name of the disease.
*22:28.720- 22:33.020* :  We can't sit and wait for the children and even adults could die. They won the vaccines.
*22:33.100- 22:39.160* :  Just over three weeks ago, this hospital was used to treat all sorts of diseases and conditions.
*22:39.860- 22:44.920* :  They used to get around 80 patients a month. But the outbreak got so bad here,
*22:44.920- 22:48.520* :  they had to convert it into an Mpox-only treatment centre.
*22:49.140- 22:52.560* :  Now they've had nearly 200 patients in three weeks.
*22:53.340- 22:58.940* :  Healthcare workers here say if the government doesn't step in quickly, things will only get worse.
*23:04.200- 23:05.400* :  It's a very convenient don't fall.
*23:08.360- 23:12.220* :  Remain in motivated is difficult for nurses like Immanuel Fakiri,
*23:12.700- 23:17.420* :  who's worked here for four years. Every day, he fears catching and passing
*23:17.420- 23:22.860* :  Mpox on to his own children, who are only seven, five, and one year old.
*23:26.780- 23:29.860* :  We've learned from social media that the vaccine is already available.
*23:30.240- 23:34.380* :  You saw how I touched the patients, because that's my job as a nurse.
*23:35.240- 23:38.600* :  So we are asking the government to help us by first giving us the vaccines.
*23:39.520- 23:45.060* :  It's a sentiment shared by his colleague, Dr. Pacific Caranzo, who's had to observe his
*23:45.100- 23:46.460* :  patients' share beds.
*23:49.560- 23:54.180* :  You will see that the patients are slipping out of the floor, as far as other challenges are
*23:54.420- 23:56.600* :  concerned. There's still no staff motivation.
*23:56.800- 24:00.140* :  Past or protective equipment isn't enough of it.
*24:00.600- 24:05.040* :  We try to do what we can to look after the sick, and not to put ourselves at risk either.
*24:05.040- 24:07.160* :  We're not spared from the disease.
*24:07.160- 24:13.160* :  This region of the DR Congo has experienced a battle of control over its mineral rich land
*24:13.160- 24:19.280* :  for nearly 30 years. While South Kiwi's governor, Jean-Jacques Perussi-Cediqui,
*24:19.460- 24:22.840* :  says the government is doing its best to get medics what they need.
*24:22.840- 24:27.960* :  He told us the conflict was proving costly and making things harder.
*24:28.560- 24:33.560* :  We are facing many challenges. We don't have roads. I mean, the war is going on.
*24:34.020- 24:39.680* :  We are accommodating thousands of IDPs. The country is losing a lot of money in trying to address
*24:39.680- 24:44.500* :  this war. The medicine will come in less than two weeks. I'm going to live on myself.
*24:45.220- 24:48.980* :  I will definitely deliver what is available in terms of urgent assistance.
*24:49.720- 24:51.460* :  I am confident that we will succeed.
*24:53.960- 24:59.100* :  That certainty is not yet mirrored by staff at this Ampox Treatment Centre, whose dedication
*24:59.100- 25:04.160* :  ensured there have been no deaths here. Yet, they promised to keep showing up,
*25:04.800- 25:06.940* :  despite the bleakness of what lies ahead.
*25:07.700- 25:11.480* :  Simea John Oshar reporting from South Kiwi in eastern Congo.
*25:12.480- 25:17.500* :  When President Luis Sinacio Lula de Silva moved into Brazil's presidential palace last February,
*25:17.500- 25:22.920* :  he accused his predecessor, Gia Bolsonaro, of stripping the place of hundreds of pieces of
*25:22.920- 25:28.420* :  furniture. A court has just awarded Mr. Bolsonaro and his wife more than two and a half thousand
*25:28.420- 25:34.000* :  dollars in damages over those claims. It's a rare legal and personal victory for the far-right
*25:34.000- 25:38.900* :  former leader, who has faced countless allegations of wrongdoing since leaving office.
*25:39.500- 25:45.080* :  As Leandro Presyresh from BBC Brazil explains, he was accused of taking a whole host of goods.
*25:45.800- 25:52.280* :  In total, the federal government stated that 261 items had gone missing during the transition
*25:52.320- 25:56.980* :  from Bolsonaro to Lula's administration. The issue is that in March of this year,
*25:57.600- 26:02.680* :  it came out to information that the federal government had found all of these items as they were
*26:02.680- 26:08.760* :  located in different parts of the presidential palace. Originally, Bolsonaro sued Lula personally
*26:08.760- 26:14.440* :  in person, but a federal court dismissed the case saying that it was the federal government that
*26:14.440- 26:19.780* :  should be sued and not Lula as an individual. So Bolsonaro failed another lawsuit against
*26:19.780- 26:25.040* :  the federal government. In this case, Bolsonaro claimed that Lula's words had misled the public
*26:25.040- 26:32.060* :  opinion with false information about him. Bolsonaro lawyers also requested $3,000 US dollars
*26:32.060- 26:37.840* :  reparation and asked for a public statement to be posted by the presidency. But what happened
*26:37.840- 26:44.940* :  was that the judge imposed a $2.6,000 US dollars fine and denied the request for this public statement.
*26:44.940- 26:49.680* :  In terms of the money, it's not really a big win, but when it comes to the narrative,
*26:50.360- 26:53.740* :  it's important to remember that Brazil remains a very polarized country. So
*26:54.140- 26:59.120* :  for the narrative of someone who's been persecuted, which is what he's been claiming since
*26:59.120- 27:04.180* :  he left office, it makes a lot of sense. The Andro Presyresh of BBC Brazil.
*27:05.060- 27:10.460* :  Much of modern life is spent online with billions of us on Facebook, YouTube, and other social
*27:10.460- 27:15.780* :  media sites. But what happens to your digital accounts and online assets when you die?
*27:16.500- 27:20.860* :  New research from the British consumer group, which suggests that most people don't have a plan
*27:20.860- 27:26.460* :  for digital death. It's urging people to work out in advance what to do with their digital assets.
*27:26.460- 27:30.040* :  The group's technology expert, Andrew Loughlin, spoke to the BBC.
*27:30.740- 27:34.100* :  Nobody really wants to talk about death, but it is important to think about these things,
*27:34.100- 27:39.360* :  isn't it? But I think what's important is when we think about our will, we often think about
*27:39.360- 27:43.460* :  like physical things like I'm going to give this picture to someone or this
*27:44.000- 27:48.700* :  suggestive draws and you also might think about obviously money you've got in bank accounts and
*27:48.700- 27:55.720* :  who's going to get an inheritance and so on and so forth. But actually nowadays, an awful lot
*27:55.720- 28:01.340* :  of our most valuable and pressured sort of possessions quite well is held digitally. I mean,
*28:01.540- 28:07.080* :  I can example of that is say you and your partner have got loads of photos of the kids when
*28:07.080- 28:12.060* :  they were young, but they're all in a digital locker, say an online cloud storage solution.
*28:12.660- 28:17.620* :  If you don't think about how that person's going to access those photos, they could be in theory
*28:17.620- 28:23.540* :  lost forever. So it's important that people think about these things really. It can be quite tricky.
*28:23.540- 28:28.700* :  You can designate someone as a legacy contact, which gives you some access rights to your Facebook
*28:28.700- 28:33.040* :  account. But if not, and this is the case in a lot of these situations, you are kind of having
*28:33.040- 28:38.400* :  to prove that you deserve to have access rights to that data. And the reason why is because
*28:38.760- 28:45.160* :  you don't actually have any inherent rights to that person's information, your data rights
*28:45.160- 28:50.320* :  cease when you pass away. So it's not like they are then passed on to your next
*28:50.320- 28:56.100* :  with Kindirekli, rather that person has to prove that they have the rights. In some cases,
*28:56.100- 29:01.660* :  this can mean bursty because death certificates, in some cases actually, such as with Microsoft,
*29:02.100- 29:05.260* :  can actually mean getting caught order. Andrew Goffin.
*29:05.800- 29:10.660* :  Returning now to the US presidential debate, and shortly after Donald Trump and Kamala Harris
*29:10.660- 29:15.440* :  made their closing statements, one of the world's biggest pop stars Taylor Swift announced her
*29:15.440- 29:22.480* :  support form as Harris in an online post to her more than 280 million followers. And let's say
*29:22.480- 29:28.300* :  that young women who comprise much of her loyal group of fans are likely to be a key demographic
*29:28.300- 29:33.540* :  in the election. California's Democratic governor Gavin Newsom said the Trump campaign
*29:33.540- 29:39.500* :  shouldn't underestimate Swift's support. Some advice to Donald Trump, don't disparage that
*29:39.500- 29:46.380* :  endorsement at your own peril. She is a cultural icon. Something big has happened in the world,
*29:46.380- 29:51.380* :  in terms of the energy and vibrancy she's associated with, the optimism she's associated with.
*29:51.800- 29:55.900* :  That was a big deal. But the Republican Matt Gaetz was more dismissive.
*29:56.520- 30:01.600* :  I love when liberals make our art and our music and conservatives make our law and our policy.
*30:02.180- 30:05.100* :  Our reporter David Lewis considers the pop stars endorsement.
*30:05.800- 30:10.960* :  As American viewers digested, the two presidential candidates knocking lumps out of each other,
*30:10.960- 30:16.360* :  in Philadelphia, pop star Taylor Swift waded in with what could be the most important endorsement
*30:16.360- 30:21.740* :  of this election. I'm voting for at Kamala Harris because she fights for the rights and causes
*30:21.740- 30:25.340* :  I believe need a warrior to champion them. She wrote on social media.
*30:25.840- 30:30.720* :  She went on to call Ms Harris a steady-handed gifted leader and also praised her running
*30:30.720- 30:36.460* :  mate Tim Waltz for his support of LGBT issues and reproductive rights. And what the singer
*30:36.460- 30:44.060* :  songwriter says matters with an Instagram following of 283 million, many, many decimal points larger
*30:44.060- 30:48.940* :  than mine. She has more subscribers than there are eligible voters in the United States.
*30:48.940- 30:53.380* :  Shannon Felton spent who's a political strategist went on to explain the possible
*30:53.380- 30:58.460* :  implications of Swift's comments. Her endorsement in the past has had an impact.
*30:59.540- 31:04.200* :  And so yes, the potential of it is huge. I, you know, it's also running across all the net
*31:04.240- 31:07.780* :  with the American networks right now, even though we just had the debate. So her timing is,
*31:08.260- 31:14.680* :  as always, impeccable. She's a marketing genius. But I will say the other thing about Taylor Swift,
*31:14.680- 31:18.800* :  what's interesting about this endorsement is she doesn't really like to get into the political
*31:18.800- 31:23.120* :  fray as much she has done in the past, but she's really, really choosy with it.
*31:23.360- 31:28.040* :  The reality is this endorsement shouldn't come as the greatest political shock of this feisty
*31:28.040- 31:32.940* :  campaign. Swift publicly backed the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020, and her fanbase
*31:32.940- 31:37.780* :  tend to be skewed towards young women who are already likely to be voting Democrat. But the
*31:37.780- 31:43.140* :  enormity of her stardom and following matter in her post she urged first-time voters to register
*31:43.620- 31:48.720* :  and announce she'd post a link with more voting information on her page. Swift then signed the
*31:48.720- 31:54.420* :  post as a childless cat lady, a reference to comments made by Trump's running mate JD Vance
*31:54.420- 32:00.320* :  about women who don't have children. David Lewis, and since that endorsement, Donald Trump claimed
*32:00.320- 32:06.340* :  that Taylor Swift would quote, pay a price with fans. For backing Carmella Harris, he told Fox News,
*32:06.340- 32:11.960* :  I was not a Taylor Swift fan. She's a very liberal person. And for balance, we should say that
*32:11.960- 32:18.160* :  former wrestler Hulk Hogan, TV star Amber Rose, and billionaire Elon Musk have all endorsed Donald
*32:21.320- 32:25.480* :  Trump. And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon. This
*32:25.480- 32:30.660* :  edition was mixed by Masoud Ibrahim Kaelan, produced by Chantal Hartle, our editors Karen Martin.
