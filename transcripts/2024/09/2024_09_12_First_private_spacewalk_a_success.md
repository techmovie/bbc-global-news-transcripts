*01:19.080- 01:22.440* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.420- 01:29.600* :  I'm Janet Joliel and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday the 12th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:30.340- 01:35.460* :  A billionaire becomes one of two astronauts to conduct the first ever commercial spacewalk.
*01:35.460- 01:40.520* :  We look at what this means for the future of space travel. The family of the jailed
*01:40.540- 01:46.460* :  Belarusian opposition leader, Maria Koliesnikova, say they fear she is being slowly killed.
*01:49.460- 01:55.660* :  Also in this podcast, bananas are selected, peeled, sweetened and does in yeast and lemons to
*01:55.660- 02:02.980* :  preserve taste. They're then fermented to make wine. The ingenious new way farmers in Malawi are
*02:02.980- 02:13.440* :  using over ripe bananas. We start in space where shortly before we recorded this podcast a new
*02:13.440- 02:21.280* :  frontier was breached about 700 kilometers above earth, the world's first spacewalk by a private
*02:21.280- 02:27.920* :  citizen. A billionaire Jared Isaacman was first after spacecraft. He was then followed by fellow
*02:27.920- 02:34.080* :  non-professional astronaut SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis. They were testing their next generation
*02:34.080- 02:39.640* :  space suits with the aim of eventually a mission going to the moon and their Mars.
*02:40.300- 02:44.640* :  This was a moment where Mr. Isaacman emerged as a crew on Earth watched.
*02:45.120- 02:48.020* :  There is our first view of the forward hatch.
*02:52.540- 02:57.140* :  Once again, this helmet cam, where we met structure we see is the spacewalker.
*02:57.560- 03:01.760* :  This is Jared now egressing through the forward hatch of dragon resilience.
*03:03.620- 03:05.540* :  I have a feeling the crowd is about to go wild.
*03:17.940- 03:21.760* :  The words of Jared Isaacman, as he emerged from that spacecraft,
*03:21.760- 03:26.920* :  well the two astronauts were outside the capsule for a total of 15 minutes as they
*03:26.920- 03:32.480* :  conducted a series of mobility tests on their space suits. Dr. Kathleen Lewis is a space
*03:32.480- 03:36.900* :  historian. She gave her reaction to the first ever commercial spacewalk.
*03:37.700- 03:43.540* :  Those were remarkable words but what I found even more remarkable is that flexibility in the
*03:43.540- 03:48.280* :  the elbows and the shoulders of the suit. Operating inside his space suit is like
*03:48.280- 03:55.700* :  operating inside a sealed balloon. Dr. Simian Barber, who is a planetary science specialist,
*03:56.340- 03:59.440* :  said he hoped this milestone would encourage other scientists.
*04:00.200- 04:03.020* :  I hope that is inspirational to other people watching as well.
*04:03.360- 04:08.820* :  You know Sarah Gillis started as an intern at SpaceX and now has just stepped out into space.
*04:08.820- 04:14.680* :  I just hope that inspires the next generation of the scientist engineers to get involved in space.
*04:15.900- 04:20.600* :  I asked our science correspondent Palab Gosh what it was like watching the live pictures of this
*04:20.600- 04:27.800* :  groundbreaking spacewalk. Emotional I think is the word. I have to say as a kind of hard boiled
*04:27.800- 04:33.780* :  science correspondent I've seen lots of missions and the risk is that it stops being so special but
*04:34.460- 04:41.100* :  when we saw what Jarrah saw he had a helmet can we could it was a point of view picture. He clambered
*04:41.100- 04:50.500* :  up through the hatch and emerged this beautiful view of the earth and is saying it looks like a
*04:50.500- 04:57.440* :  perfect world. It was like that one small step moment historic words for an historic moment
*04:57.900- 05:03.360* :  that had been spacewalks before but this is the first time that's been carried out by a totally
*05:03.360- 05:11.760* :  private crew. It has a lot of firsts as well. It also did it without an airlock but it went
*05:11.760- 05:18.380* :  incredibly smoothly. The private sector has today shown that it can do everything NASA can do
*05:18.980- 05:24.320* :  but more cheaply so this is the start of something but just right now it's a job well done.
*05:25.060- 05:29.760* :  A job well done and it was interesting looking at these spacesuits because they do look different
*05:29.760- 05:34.840* :  from what we're used to seeing. Tell us about why they're so important. What they were testing
*05:34.840- 05:41.140* :  these two astronauts when they went out in these suits. The spacesuits we saw in some of us saw in
*05:41.140- 05:47.340* :  the Apollo missions and you can still see a very bulky you know the space is cold. It's extremely
*05:47.340- 05:54.300* :  cold and also there's a vacuum of space and you need to have backpacks and so you know astronauts
*05:54.300- 06:01.620* :  look like kind of snow people and and even the modern day suits since then are to slim down
*06:01.620- 06:09.600* :  but these new spacesuits from SpaceX are slimmer still and the the watchword has been comfort
*06:10.040- 06:17.560* :  and reusability but also the suits are designed to be reusable at the moment. Space suits are
*06:17.560- 06:23.380* :  developed for one particular astronaut so if you can reuse a space suit using for another person
*06:23.380- 06:28.740* :  that saves a lot of money. Not having an airlock saves lots of money and the whole idea is to
*06:28.740- 06:34.600* :  reduce costs so you can have more missions to space to try and build infrastructure on the moon
*06:34.600- 06:40.220* :  and around the moon make space travel more commonplace. Human spaceflight is back with
*06:40.220- 06:46.240* :  a vengeance and who knows what's possible particularly with the private sector driving it now.
*06:47.300- 06:52.480* :  Palabgosh with the aim of eventually sending a mission to the moon and then to Mars.
*06:53.860- 06:59.140* :  Four years ago Belarus's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko was almost forced from power
*06:59.140- 07:03.680* :  by huge street protests. One of those imprisoned in the crack down that followed was the
*07:03.680- 07:08.760* :  oppositional leader Maria Koyestnikova. A figure sometimes compared to the widely admired
*07:08.760- 07:14.960* :  Putin critic Alexei Navalny who died in a Russian jail. Now her family say they fear that she's
*07:14.960- 07:19.140* :  being slowly killed as she's kept in solitary confinement and not given enough food.
*07:19.720- 07:24.140* :  The news of her flight came as Mr. Lukashenko began a surprise release of other political prisoners
*07:24.700- 07:29.160* :  leading some to wonder whether he's signaling to Western governments that he wants to reduce his
*07:29.160- 07:33.780* :  own political isolation. Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford reports.
*07:40.700- 07:48.820* :  Tatiana is desperately worried about her sister. Maria Koyestnikova was locked up for
*07:48.820- 07:56.240* :  leading peaceful mass protests in Belarus in 2020. Crowds rallying against an election rigged
*07:56.320- 08:02.800* :  to return Alexander Lukashenko to power. But the activist is being punished further in prison,
*08:03.640- 08:12.080* :  kept in isolation for 18 months now, no visits, no letters, no calls, and increasing concerns
*08:12.080- 08:19.460* :  for her health. What we hear she is starving in the colony, her illness requires a diet. She
*08:19.460- 08:25.880* :  basically cannot eat what the food they provide in the colony. I believe that she already passed
*08:25.880- 08:34.560* :  such a critical weight loss that endures her life. I think that any means should be used to
*08:35.500- 08:39.600* :  help her to save her because her situation is critical.
*08:42.880- 08:49.440* :  This is walking through this pedestrian area of central Warsaw and people in the coffee shops
*08:49.480- 08:56.080* :  here, the vast majority of them are speaking Russian. A lot of them are from Belarus. A lot of them
*08:56.720- 09:01.560* :  took part in those protests in 2020 and left so they didn't get arrested.
*09:10.500- 09:17.180* :  For Dimitri Lukashenko, this city is now home. The journalist spent 28 months locked up.
*09:17.180- 09:23.200* :  His only crime was to report on the opposition protests and then on his country's complicity
*09:23.200- 09:30.700* :  in the war on Ukraine. In one prison camp he worked breaking rocks alongside men convicted of
*09:30.700- 09:37.940* :  murder and drug smuggling. But he tells me up to 30% of the inmates were there for their politics.
*09:38.920- 09:42.900* :  You can spot them by the yellow tags they have stitched on their chest.
*09:46.800- 09:51.680* :  This summer though, Dimitri was suddenly pardoned by Alexander Lukashenko.
*09:52.660- 09:58.860* :  He is one of about 80 political prisoners released so far in a series of surprise amnesty.
*10:04.440- 10:08.860* :  Maybe those who started the process, the arrests, realized they went too far.
*10:09.900- 10:15.840* :  I don't know, but it's such a moment of joy to be home, to hug our families and to breathe freely
*10:15.840- 10:20.780* :  again. The main thing is that this process is happening and for it not to stop.
*10:27.520- 10:31.900* :  That media are presenting the pardons as proof of a caring, humane leader.
*10:32.700- 10:37.960* :  There's another election due next year, so it is possible Lukashenko is looking to soften his image.
*10:39.940- 10:43.200* :  Others think he's signaling to the West that he wants to engage.
*10:44.180- 10:48.920* :  The chances of big name prisoners like Maria Kolesnikov are getting out, look slim.
*10:52.700- 10:56.360* :  Dimitri thinks about Maria Kolesnikov a lot.
*10:56.360- 11:03.940* :  She became hugely popular during the 2020 protests, but Dimitri knows how in prison political
*11:03.940- 11:07.260* :  detainees are singled out for extra punishment.
*11:11.820- 11:15.980* :  And even though he's out now, he admits he jumps at every noise,
*11:16.580- 11:21.280* :  terrified the police are coming for him again to lock him up again.
*11:23.680- 11:27.660* :  You understand that you've done nothing wrong and they shouldn't be coming for you,
*11:27.740- 11:31.160* :  but you can't tell your heart that, Dimitri says.
*11:32.700- 11:35.480* :  It is the brutal Belarus of today.
*11:37.340- 11:39.060* :  And your heart is afraid.
*11:39.820- 11:41.680* :  That report by Sarah Reinsford.
*11:42.940- 11:47.040* :  The head of the UN has described an Israeli attack on a school in which six UN workers
*11:47.040- 11:51.960* :  were killed as totally unacceptable. It's the fifth time that the school in Gaza has been hit
*11:51.960- 11:57.360* :  by Israeli forces since the start of their current war with Hamas. The Hamas' run health
*11:57.360- 12:02.200* :  authorities say 18 people were killed in all. The UN Agency for Palestinian refugees,
*12:02.200- 12:06.580* :  Unre, said it was a single, deadliest attack for its workers since the war began.
*12:07.260- 12:10.620* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Daniel Desimone told us more.
*12:11.120- 12:16.640* :  This attack took place on Wednesday. It was an air strike by the Israeli military.
*12:16.640- 12:22.980* :  The UN Agency concern Unre says two air strikes hit a school in its surroundings in Nuzerat
*12:22.980- 12:29.220* :  in central Gaza. And among those killed was the manager of the shelter and other team members.
*12:29.500- 12:33.320* :  And they say that the school has been hit five times now since the war began.
*12:34.120- 12:39.700* :  And it's home to around 12,000 displaced people, mainly women and children.
*12:40.580- 12:47.740* :  And Unre says no one is safe in Gaza. Unre's head had said that at least 220 of its staff
*12:47.740- 12:54.940* :  have now been killed in Gaza since the war began between Hamas and Israel in October last year.
*12:55.740- 13:02.120* :  And the UN's head, Antonio Guterres, says that these dramatic violations of international
*13:02.120- 13:09.480* :  humanitarian law need to stop now. The Hamas' run government media office in Gaza said
*13:09.480- 13:16.580* :  18 people were killed in the strike yesterday. And the UN said that six of its staff were
*13:16.580- 13:20.060* :  among those killed. So what does Israel said in response to this?
*13:20.160- 13:25.960* :  Well, so the Israeli military said that it conducted what it called a precise strike on terrorists
*13:25.960- 13:31.900* :  who were operating inside a Hamas command and control centre in the compound. And that it was
*13:31.900- 13:38.900* :  being used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute attacks against the Israeli military.
*13:39.520- 13:43.960* :  And Israel itself. And they say that prior to the strike numerous steps were taken to mitigate
*13:43.960- 13:50.860* :  the risk of harming civilians. Now, Israel argues that this is another example of Hamas
*13:51.680- 13:56.060* :  effectively exploiting civilian infrastructure for its own ends.
*13:56.460- 14:00.420* :  So where does this leave the work of the UN Palestinian Agency? Because it has so much to do here.
*14:00.420- 14:05.160* :  We've just had this polio vaccination campaign. It's trying to protect people who are homeless,
*14:05.160- 14:10.700* :  who are suffering diseases and malnutrition. This makes their job even harder, doesn't it?
*14:10.960- 14:16.100* :  It does well that, you know, that their head, Philly Lazareini has come out since what happened
*14:16.100- 14:22.180* :  yesterday and said that humanitarian staff premises and operations have been blatantly and
*14:22.180- 14:27.160* :  unabatedly disregarded since the beginning of the war. There's no sense in which they're going
*14:27.160- 14:32.000* :  to stop their operations because of this. But the senior UN staff are coming out and be very,
*14:32.000- 14:36.060* :  very critical following what happened yesterday. Daniel Dismoney.
*14:37.320- 14:42.320* :  Now, if you open your fridge and see a black, overripe banana, you might think about making
*14:42.320- 14:47.820* :  banana bread or banana muffins. Well, in Malawi, extreme weather patterns are forcing farmers to
*14:47.820- 14:53.520* :  experiment with new ways of using their harvests. Some of them are now turning overripe bananas that
*14:53.520- 15:00.040* :  would otherwise go to waste into a surprising new product. Wine. And as Anne Okuma reports,
*15:00.040- 15:10.020* :  it seems to be a hit with both producers and consumers. Emile is clearing weed from her once
*15:10.020- 15:17.860* :  thriving banana plantation. A severe heat wave has turned most of her harvests into
*15:17.860- 15:24.260* :  caught soil and dried up leaves. If it's sad that we have to go through all this waste,
*15:24.400- 15:28.680* :  the heat here is unbearable. All our hard work and investment is lost.
*15:33.820- 15:37.880* :  Extreme weather events in Karonga district north and Malawi have become more frequent.
*15:38.420- 15:42.800* :  Farmers here face a challenging mix of harsh heat and intense rain.
*15:44.840- 15:50.200* :  Emile relocated her farm from the shores of Lake Malawi to higher grounds to protect her land
*15:50.200- 15:55.400* :  from flooding. But now, searing temperatures have made farming nearly impossible.
*15:58.020- 16:02.280* :  Some of the bananas fell off their branches. Some you can't even see where we planted.
*16:03.200- 16:08.080* :  Down at the old farm, our challenge was loads of water from the lake. Up here, we have way too much
*16:08.080- 16:12.160* :  it from the sun. All this makes our bananas ripen very fast and go to waste.
*16:14.700- 16:19.820* :  So instead of throwing away overripe bananas, Emile and her colleagues have put them to better use.
*16:22.480- 16:24.680* :  The use of a ripe bananas to make wine.
*16:25.820- 16:31.620* :  Bananas are selected, peeled, sweetened and doused in yeast and lemons to preserve taste.
*16:32.280- 16:34.180* :  They are then fermented to make wine.
*16:35.940- 16:41.340* :  Tenison Gondwe is the CEO of Compsip Cooperative Union which has been helping women venture
*16:41.340- 16:48.400* :  into this business. There was quite a lot of problems for the farmers to transition from
*16:48.400- 16:54.560* :  banana as a subsistered crop to a wine making. To maintain quality and taste of the banana wine,
*16:54.560- 17:00.320* :  that's why we are saying we have invested very much in capacity to train them on how to
*17:00.320- 17:06.900* :  to have quality production and also to maintain the taste. That's why we also have our
*17:06.900- 17:13.300* :  colleagues in Marlboro standards which is trying to satisfy her. We have also assisted them
*17:13.300- 17:18.500* :  with the equipment for them to measure the quality and the quality content of the banana wine.
*17:20.160- 17:25.240* :  Vignettes that rely on stable climates are threatened by the unpredictability of climate change.
*17:26.280- 17:32.260* :  So could bananas replace crops for wine making? What is for sure now is that banana wine has proved
*17:32.260- 17:37.920* :  a success in neighboring markets in Tanzania and Rwanda. But what about here in Malawi?
*17:39.000- 17:42.280* :  Back at the farm, wine makers have a taste of their labor.
*17:53.280- 17:56.980* :  Adapting to climate change is a tough challenge for farmers around the world,
*17:57.440- 18:02.900* :  but as the farming community in this part of Malawi can testify, there can be alternative solutions.
*18:03.600- 18:08.080* :  As the sea almost goes, if life gives you over every bananas, make wine.
*18:11.400- 18:14.920* :  Anokumu reporting and staying with eating fruits or plants,
*18:15.460- 18:19.920* :  reaching for the medicine in the first aid kit to treat an injury or sickness is fairly common
*18:19.920- 18:25.200* :  for us, but it's not something we would generally expect animals to do. Now researchers in Gabon
*18:25.200- 18:31.000* :  studying plants eaten by wild gorillas say the primates could hold clues to future drug discoveries
*18:31.480- 18:32.900* :  as Rebecca Wood reports.
*18:40.760- 18:46.500* :  Fewer than 150,000 western lowland gorillas survive in the wild in Central and West Africa.
*18:47.200- 18:53.040* :  They live in dense forest, feeding on stems, bamboo shoots and fruits. Now scientists have
*18:53.040- 18:58.100* :  discovered that amongst that diet are plants with medicinal effects that could help fight
*18:58.100- 19:04.120* :  super bugs in humans. The study took place in Gabon's Makalabadudu National Park,
*19:04.120- 19:09.520* :  where researchers observed the behavior of the primates and recorded the plants they ate.
*19:10.260- 19:14.800* :  They also interviewed people living in a nearby village, including traditional healers and
*19:14.800- 19:21.340* :  herbalists about the plants used in local medical practices. And they then found four native plant
*19:21.340- 19:28.000* :  species we use by both, and when tested, all showed antibacterial activity against at least one
*19:28.000- 19:34.260* :  multi-drug resistant strain of the bug E. Coli. And the one they're most excited about is the
*19:34.260- 19:40.340* :  bug of the Frommarje tree, which they say showed remarkable activity against all strains of the
*19:40.340- 19:46.140* :  infection. The observation adds to a growing body of evidence about the way primates use plants
*19:46.140- 19:52.700* :  to keep healthy, a wounded orangutan in Indonesia recently made headlines for using a plant
*19:52.700- 19:59.980* :  paste to heal an injury. And in 2022, scientists reported on chimpanzees that were seen apparently
*19:59.980- 20:05.060* :  applying insects to wounds. Although the researchers said it's not clear if this particular
*20:05.060- 20:10.480* :  group in Gabon were consuming the barkers food or medicine, his hoped further research on the
*20:10.480- 20:17.280* :  four plants may yield promising drugs to treat bacterial infections, the sort of primate prescription.

*21:57.980- 22:02.940* :  The former president of Peru, Alberto Fujimori, who spent a decade and a half in prison for
*22:02.940- 22:09.200* :  crimes against humanity, has died at the age of 86. Mr Fujimori, who was of Japanese heritage,
*22:09.200- 22:15.300* :  won the presidency in 1990, defeating the writer Mario Vargas Losa in a surprise result.
*22:15.980- 22:21.020* :  His decade as president was marked by sieges and massacres, including a four-month hostage
*22:21.020- 22:26.620* :  drama at the Japanese Embassy in Lima. He was loved by many for crushing and notorious left-wing
*22:26.700- 22:32.720* :  path guerrillas, but hated by others for the ruthless authoritarian and corrupt way he
*22:32.720- 22:38.100* :  governed, including the use of death squads. He was released from jail last year because of ill
*22:38.100- 22:43.840* :  health. Danny Aeberhard looks back on Alberto Fujimori's controversial legacy.
*22:44.880- 22:49.480* :  Alberto Fujimori came to power as a true outsider. His background was humble,
*22:49.480- 22:56.140* :  born in 1938 to Japanese immigrant parents. An agricultural engineer by training, he emerged from
*22:56.140- 23:01.780* :  relative obscurity in academia to win the presidency in 1990 and promptly cultivated the image of a
*23:01.780- 23:07.280* :  maverick. He took over during a perfect storm of crises, the country crippled by hyperinflation
*23:07.540- 23:12.060* :  and a bloody insurgency by two left-wing guerrilla groups, the Tupac Amaro Revolutionary
*23:12.060- 23:17.420* :  Movement and the much bigger shining path. On the economic front, his neoliberal program of
*23:17.420- 23:22.180* :  shock therapy soon ended Peru's hyperinflation and ushered in a period of rapid growth.
*23:23.100- 23:28.520* :  He also authorised a fight back against the insurgency. 1992 proved a breakthrough year,
*23:28.900- 23:32.260* :  above all with the capture of the leader of the shining path Abbey Mahoguse Man.
*23:32.960- 23:36.760* :  Within a couple of years, the shining path was defeated as a major threat to the state.
*23:37.500- 23:41.240* :  This, for his supporters, was perhaps Alberto Fujimori's crowning achievement.
*23:42.080- 23:46.560* :  The threat from the rebel insurgency hadn't completely abated, however. In late 1996,
*23:46.560- 23:52.480* :  Tupac Amaro guerrillas took 800 guests hostage at a party being held at the Japanese ambassador's
*23:52.480- 23:57.560* :  residence in Lima, demanding the release of imprisoned comrades. The president refused.
*23:58.340- 24:02.140* :  During the long standoff that followed, all but some 70 hostages were released.
*24:03.040- 24:08.020* :  The drama gripped the world. Then, in April 1997, the crisis came to a head.
*24:13.920- 24:19.480* :  Peruvian Commando stormed the residents, killing all 14 guerrillas. Only one hostage died.
*24:20.400- 24:23.920* :  After the siege, Mr. Fujimori reiterated his hard-line stance.
*24:31.960- 24:36.360* :  In Peru, we are not going to accept terrorism.
*24:37.160- 24:42.040* :  In Peru, we're going to lay the foundations of the principles of democracy.
*24:42.800- 24:46.840* :  But a growing number of critics attacked what they saw as Mr. Fujimori's increasing disregard
*24:46.840- 24:52.040* :  for Peru's domestic institutions. This trait at first manifested itself in 1992,
*24:52.500- 24:55.700* :  when he dissolved Congress after accusing it of obstructing progress.
*24:56.620- 25:01.400* :  His democratic credentials were further weakened by a series of scandals, culminating in 2000,
*25:01.400- 25:06.640* :  when his former intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, fled the country after video evidence
*25:06.640- 25:12.140* :  emerged of him bribing opposition politicians. Soon after, President Fujimori fled to Japan.
*25:12.900- 25:18.120* :  As a dual national, he evaded Peruvian justice. But in 2005, on a visit to Chile,
*25:18.120- 25:23.800* :  he was arrested and subsequently extradited to Peru. There he was convicted in a series of trials
*25:23.800- 25:29.820* :  on charges including corruption and abuse of power. Most damningly, he was sentenced to 25 years in
*25:29.820- 25:35.280* :  jail for being behind two death squad massacres in the early 1990s. It was the first time a
*25:35.280- 25:39.820* :  democratically elected Latin American leader had been tried and found guilty in his own country
*25:39.820- 25:46.940* :  of human rights abuses. Danny Aberhard would that look back on the life of Alberto Fujimori.
*25:48.040- 25:51.560* :  To the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires now, where there have been some violent
*25:51.560- 26:00.760* :  disturbances outside the Parliament building. Thousands of people protested against President
*26:00.760- 26:05.620* :  Javier Milé's veto of a rise in pensions. The protesters, many of them pensioners,
*26:05.620- 26:11.140* :  tore down police barriers and banged pots and pans. Police responded with pepper spray and
*26:11.140- 26:16.780* :  rubber bullets. Our correspondent in Buenos Aires, Natalio Cossoi, told us why anger is running so
*26:17.900- 26:24.460* :  high. Pensions represent a big chunk of government expenditure and when a government wants to
*26:24.460- 26:31.120* :  implement a plan like Milés, he definitely ends up touching pensions. And Natalio, they were
*26:31.120- 26:36.900* :  trying to get an 8.1 percent pension, right? That sounds quite a lot until he realised that
*26:36.900- 26:43.580* :  year-on-year inflation was 240 percent. Just give us an idea as to how pensioners in Argentina
*26:43.580- 26:50.480* :  get by on 230 dollars a month. How far does that go? That's not enough to cover the basic
*26:50.480- 26:56.720* :  basket of goods and services you need to live. Every month what we've been getting from the
*26:56.720- 27:02.800* :  previous government and this one is discretional bonus that tries to compensate for that and
*27:02.800- 27:09.480* :  means that they just about manage this basic basket of goods. But it's really, really tough
*27:09.480- 27:14.340* :  for them. And President Javier Milé came in promising to slash government spending and
*27:14.340- 27:20.920* :  is it having the desired effect of improving the economy? Well, in terms of slowing down inflation,
*27:20.960- 27:27.200* :  for instance, it's been working rather well, if you wish, although inflation seems to have found
*27:28.160- 27:34.360* :  its basic level where it doesn't seem to be able to move down from that, which is around 4 percent
*27:34.360- 27:43.120* :  a month. But at the same time, all this cutting and spending has caused a very serious recession. So
*27:43.580- 27:48.680* :  in terms of a recovery of the economy, I think we can say it's with far from there. In terms of how
*27:48.680- 27:52.880* :  inflation is looking, it's looking better. And the government wants to show that it can control
*27:52.880- 27:58.860* :  the budget so that in the future it might be able to borrow money from abroad, which it currently
*27:58.860- 28:05.860* :  can't. And Talio Kosoi in Argentina talking to Nick Miles. Europe's Consumer Rights Group has
*28:05.860- 28:10.740* :  accused some of the biggest game developers of deliberately tricking players into spending more
*28:10.740- 28:15.820* :  money than they intended. The group are more than 20 of its member countries have filed a complaint
*28:15.820- 28:21.260* :  with the European Commission. Olivia Noon reports. The Consumer Rights Group says many of the
*28:21.260- 28:25.940* :  companies such as those behind Fortnite and Minecraft were manipulating players into over
*28:25.940- 28:30.620* :  spending on in-game vegetable currencies. The group said players, particularly children, were
*28:30.620- 28:35.620* :  vulnerable because they went where of the true value of online currencies. Games often allow
*28:35.620- 28:41.280* :  players to exchange real cash for gems, points or coins. The group is calling for these to be
*28:41.280- 28:46.140* :  displayed at all times in real world currency and stressed that while children are often those
*28:46.140- 28:52.560* :  playing the most, they lack financial literacy. Olivia Noon. One of our biggest stories this week has
*28:52.560- 28:58.020* :  been the US presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Perhaps the most outrageous
*28:58.020- 29:03.180* :  highlight was Mr. Trump's false claim that Haitian immigrants in the city of Springfield in Ohio
*29:03.180- 29:09.380* :  were abducting and eating pets, a claim that was immediately corrected by one of the moderators
*29:09.380- 29:14.800* :  who said a local official had denied that any such incidents had occurred. The claims have also
*29:14.800- 29:20.300* :  been dismissed by the Republican governor of Ohio, local police and the city authorities. But how
*29:20.300- 29:24.380* :  do the Haitian community in Springfield feel about the former president's claims?
*29:24.500- 29:30.300* :  Willis Dorsenville is a president of the Haitian Community Health and Support Center in Springfield,
*29:30.300- 29:38.840* :  Ohio. It's so shocking and sad at this time and it creates some fear amongst the Haitian
*29:38.840- 29:47.800* :  immigrants in Springfield. They fear for their lives and they fear as well for the kids' life.
*29:47.820- 29:55.200* :  They are so concerned that this will not escalate to violence,
*29:56.320- 30:03.220* :  so which why just to help them to understand that it might be for political aim,
*30:03.740- 30:09.220* :  but it's a shocking news for the community. They feel very scared for their lives because of that.
*30:10.240- 30:20.420* :  Seeking to occupy the highest of the USA, I think they should do better. They are well-educated
*30:20.420- 30:28.780* :  folks who know how to check the veracity of anything. That's the first thing. And the second thing
*30:28.780- 30:37.180* :  is that Jett Evans made the tweet on Monday and the debate was Tuesday night. And they have
*30:37.180- 30:44.060* :  modern 24 hours just to check the authenticity. They could just call the city manager here in
*30:44.060- 30:48.940* :  Springfield. They could have normally go on their website or the Springfield's police
*30:48.940- 30:55.020* :  department website as if anything of that is true. Just call away. They could have normally
*30:55.020- 31:01.120* :  just verify anything. But I am happy that the city officials and the city manager and the police
*31:01.120- 31:07.560* :  department, they all rejected that claim about anything that has to do with people living
*31:07.560- 31:13.860* :  past in Springfield. Willis Dawsonville of the Haitian Community Support Centre in Springfield
*31:13.860- 31:20.780* :  in Ohio. Now time for a quick message from Oliver. Hi all just a quick reminder that in the run up
*31:20.780- 31:25.480* :  to the US presidential election we'll be doing a special podcast in collaboration with our
*31:25.480- 31:30.980* :  friends at BBC America. But we need your help to come up with questions to put to the team in
*31:30.980- 31:36.120* :  the US. So if there's anything you'd like to know please send us an email to globalpodcast at
*31:36.120- 31:43.740* :  bbc.co.uk or tweet us at Global NewsPod. And if possible please record your question in a voice note.
*31:44.080- 31:50.040* :  Thank you. Now if you're a fan of the rock star John Bon Jovi here's another reason to be one.
*31:50.180- 31:54.300* :  He's been praised by police and Nashville in the US state of Tennessee for helping a woman
*31:54.300- 31:59.020* :  in distress who was on the ledge of a bridge. Video shows him going to talk to the woman who'd
*31:59.020- 32:04.200* :  climbed over the bridge's railing before then helping to guide her to safety. David Lewis has
*32:04.200- 32:11.240* :  the story. Newly released CCTV images show the tense moment John Bon Jovi sporting his trademark
*32:11.240- 32:17.700* :  leather jacket and dark jeans slowly walks over to the distressed woman. Dressed in blue she's
*32:17.700- 32:22.560* :  holding onto the railings on the wrong side of the bridge barrier below her is the Cumberland River.
*32:23.060- 32:28.920* :  As members of the public nervously watch on and some snap photos the 62 year old rock star
*32:28.920- 32:35.060* :  gives her a wave, leans across and engages her in conversation. After a short exchange he can be
*32:35.060- 32:40.040* :  seen with the aid of another bystander who was talking to the woman helping the person back over
*32:40.040- 32:46.140* :  the barrier to safety. Once she's safe he gives her a big hug. Later images show the star leaving
*32:46.140- 32:52.180* :  the bridge accompanying the woman. According to separate footage put out on social media Bon Jovi
*32:52.180- 32:57.020* :  was in the Memphis State Capitol shooting a music video. They keep the faith and bed of roses
*32:57.020- 33:02.980* :  singer has plenty of experience in helping people in need. The artist has for many years sponsored
*33:02.980- 33:08.300* :  homeless and vulnerable young people in the United States through his John Bon Jovi Soul Foundation.
*33:08.460- 33:14.160* :  Messages of appreciation have now come in online. Metro Nashville Police Department wrote
*33:14.540- 33:19.520* :  a shout out to John Bon Jovi in his team for helping a woman on the Sagan-Tahler pedestrian
*33:19.520- 33:25.400* :  bridge. While Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake said in a statement it takes
*33:25.400- 33:31.340* :  all of us to help keep each other safe. David Lewis so what do you do or say if you find someone
*33:31.340- 33:37.060* :  in that situation? Let's hear from someone who's had experience of this. Sophie Walters volunteers
*33:37.060- 33:42.600* :  with Samaritans a UK charity that offers emotional support to anyone who's struggling to cope.
*33:43.400- 33:51.440* :  I came across someone as I was walking along a towpath who looked very distressed and I stopped
*33:51.440- 33:59.200* :  and I asked if they were okay and they said no they weren't okay and I sat with them for a while
*33:59.200- 34:08.520* :  and just chatted and I think when someone is in that zone they're convinced that no one cares about
*34:08.520- 34:13.440* :  them and that the world would be better off without them and I think just showing that that you do
*34:13.440- 34:22.260* :  care makes a huge difference and then my main priority was to get them away from the zone of danger
*34:22.260- 34:31.580* :  to a situation where I could get help because I knew that if I could give them time for those
*34:32.400- 34:39.980* :  feelings to pass and to ponder what was happening in their life then they might make a different
*34:39.980- 34:44.220* :  decision. Sophie Walters from the charity Samaritans
*34:47.000- 34:51.360* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
