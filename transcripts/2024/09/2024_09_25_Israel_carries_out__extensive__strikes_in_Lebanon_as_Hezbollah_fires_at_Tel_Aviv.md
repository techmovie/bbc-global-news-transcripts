*01:25.180- 01:30.880* :  I'm Andrew Peach and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday, the 25th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:31.560- 01:36.880* :  Israel's latest barrage of strikes targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon has killed more than 20 people
*01:37.140- 01:38.440* :  and injured scores more.

*01:58.960- 02:03.440* :  Also in this podcast, do you neglect other activities in your lives and do you find yourself
*02:03.900- 02:06.220* :  maybe lying about the amount of time to family and friends?
*02:06.860- 02:09.080* :  How to know if you're addicted to your smartphone.
*02:12.180- 02:15.580* :  Let's start with the latest on the attacks between Israel and Hezbollah.
*02:16.060- 02:20.820* :  Most of Hezbollah's attacks into Israel are rocket strikes on towns in the north of Israel,
*02:20.820- 02:26.020* :  but earlier today they find what they say was a ballistic missile at the commercial capital Tel Aviv,
*02:26.360- 02:30.060* :  intended to hit the headquarters of Israel's intelligence agency Mossat.
*02:34.940- 02:38.980* :  Sirens were heard over the city and Israeli defense systems intercepted the missile.
*02:38.980- 02:44.000* :  It's the first time a Hezbollah rocket has reached Tel Aviv according to Israeli officials.
*02:44.720- 02:49.700* :  Since then, Israel has been launching what it's described as extensive strikes in the south of Lebanon,
*02:49.700- 02:53.020* :  where the health ministry says more than 20 people have been killed.
*02:53.020- 02:56.040* :  Our Middle East correspondent Yolanael is in Jerusalem.
*02:56.580- 03:02.260* :  The day really began for people in Tel Aviv with their rocket warning sirens going off.
*03:02.420- 03:04.340* :  They had to rush to bomb shelters.
*03:04.960- 03:09.380* :  This was the first time the Israeli military said that Hezbollah had fired one of its longer-range
*03:09.380- 03:11.980* :  missiles this deep into Israel.
*03:11.980- 03:13.180* :  It was intercepted.
*03:13.180- 03:16.320* :  Israel has this sophisticated air defense system.
*03:16.480- 03:19.180* :  There were no casualties and no real damage from that.
*03:19.680- 03:22.840* :  But we were told that this was a heavy warhead that was used.
*03:23.240- 03:28.300* :  The Israeli military stressing that it believed a civilian area was being targeted.
*03:28.300- 03:31.360* :  That this could have reached even further into Israeli territory.
*03:31.360- 03:34.280* :  Hezbollah claiming it was firing at Mossat headquarters.
*03:34.280- 03:39.860* :  It blames the spy agency for the pager attack targeting its operatives last week.
*03:40.260- 03:44.080* :  And some speculation about was this carefully calibrated by Hezbollah,
*03:44.080- 03:46.720* :  which knows very well about Israel's air defenses,
*03:47.380- 03:52.980* :  so that it was really maybe sending a message that it still does have this huge arsenal of longer-range weapons
*03:52.980- 03:55.400* :  that it hasn't really been using yet.
*03:55.400- 03:59.820* :  But that did trigger then a new round of cross-sport fire.
*03:59.820- 04:04.260* :  Already, Israel had been carrying out strikes on what it said with Hezbollah targets overnight.
*04:04.260- 04:09.320* :  But it then hit the launch site it said, which was far from the South Lebanon border.
*04:09.320- 04:13.540* :  And it also hit in the east of the country in this wave of strikes.
*04:13.540- 04:18.180* :  And we've seen heavy bombardment in the north of Israel coming from Hezbollah as well,
*04:18.180- 04:20.200* :  causing at least some property damage.
*04:20.200- 04:24.120* :  A reminder that if this wasn't sort of a largely evacuated area,
*04:24.500- 04:25.960* :  there would be more casualties.
*04:26.480- 04:31.620* :  And when this log jam in this situation, it seems to me where no one wants to draw back
*04:31.760- 04:33.420* :  and no one wants to escalate the thing.
*04:33.420- 04:36.940* :  So what we've just been describing is what's been happening today.
*04:36.940- 04:38.760* :  Happens day after day after day.
*04:39.280- 04:41.860* :  Yes, you do see these sort of tit-for-tat exchanges.
*04:41.860- 04:45.420* :  And it can lead to very dangerous escalation.
*04:45.420- 04:47.720* :  I mean, at the same time, it's important to highlight that these,
*04:48.040- 04:49.480* :  particularly the last three days,
*04:49.920- 04:51.780* :  in terms of the rocket fire both ways,
*04:51.780- 04:56.220* :  has really been the most intense that we've seen in 11 months of conflict
*04:56.220- 05:00.560* :  that have gone on really in parallel to the war in Gaza triggered
*05:01.040- 05:04.760* :  by that war and now taking up much more of Israel's attention.
*05:04.760- 05:08.360* :  This on top of those attacks that we saw last week
*05:08.360- 05:12.280* :  that Israel has not taken responsibility for targeting
*05:12.380- 05:15.320* :  the Hezbollah electronic devices,
*05:15.800- 05:20.520* :  Israel does say that it has killed at least three senior commanders of Hezbollah
*05:20.820- 05:22.480* :  in the past few days as well.
*05:22.680- 05:25.680* :  There have been Israeli officials briefing that they hope these attacks
*05:25.680- 05:28.700* :  would force Hezbollah into a diplomatic solution,
*05:28.700- 05:33.260* :  the solution that the U.S. President Joe Biden was saying yesterday was still possible.
*05:33.260- 05:36.740* :  But, you know, it's really not clear that that is something that would work.
*05:36.740- 05:39.220* :  Hezbollah said it would carry on with these attacks into Israel
*05:39.220- 05:42.300* :  until there was a ceasefire in Gaza.
*05:42.840- 05:46.240* :  And we've got the focus of the UN General Assembly in New York,
*05:46.240- 05:51.080* :  where leaders from the Middle East and the wider international community can have their say.
*05:51.400- 05:53.980* :  Is anyone have any hope that's going to shift the thing?
*05:53.980- 05:55.060* :  Move it on in some way.
*05:55.660- 05:59.760* :  So, certainly this latest escalation is a main subject
*05:59.760- 06:02.560* :  as world leaders are meeting in New York.
*06:02.560- 06:05.540* :  We've had President Biden also calling on Israel and Hamas
*06:05.560- 06:08.180* :  to finalize a ceasefire hostage release deal
*06:08.180- 06:10.720* :  which could calm things down across the region.
*06:10.720- 06:13.500* :  We've had these big warnings from the UN Secretary General
*06:13.500- 06:15.480* :  that Lebanon is at the brink.
*06:15.740- 06:18.220* :  It's at risk of becoming another Gaza.
*06:18.220- 06:20.340* :  And that's something that people all around the world
*06:20.340- 06:21.900* :  should be very worried about.
*06:22.440- 06:24.680* :  And we've had from the Israeli Prime Minister
*06:24.680- 06:29.040* :  who had been expected to go pretty much all week to New York
*06:29.040- 06:30.260* :  to meet different leaders.
*06:30.640- 06:33.500* :  He has delayed his trip to the UN General Assembly.
*06:33.500- 06:35.560* :  He's still supposed to speak there on Friday,
*06:35.560- 06:37.200* :  but it will now be a very short trip.
*06:37.200- 06:38.600* :  He'll travel there tomorrow.
*06:38.600- 06:41.220* :  We're told and come back the day after his address.
*06:41.860- 06:43.440* :  Yola, know with me from Jerusalem.
*06:44.140- 06:46.940* :  In Lebanon, the Israeli air strikes targeting Hezbollah
*06:46.940- 06:50.120* :  are having a devastating effect on the lives of people in the South.
*06:50.560- 06:53.340* :  Lebanese officials say hospitals are struggling to cope
*06:53.340- 06:54.520* :  with the number of casualties
*06:54.940- 06:57.380* :  and that over half a million people have been displaced.
*06:58.060- 07:01.320* :  Armidilist correspondent Hugo Besheger reports now from Beirut
*07:01.640- 07:04.740* :  which is grappling with the influx of refugees from the South.
*07:07.000- 07:09.920* :  For a second day, congested roads to Beirut.
*07:10.720- 07:13.400* :  Thousands are on the move, fleeing southern Lebanon
*07:13.400- 07:17.180* :  and Israel's air strikes that show no sign of easing.
*07:17.880- 07:21.880* :  It's conflict with Hezbollah now being felt all across the country.
*07:25.560- 07:28.760* :  Here in Beirut, this school is one of dozens
*07:28.760- 07:31.980* :  that have been turned into shelters for the displaced
*07:32.000- 07:39.480* :  6,000 people are here without knowing when or if they'll be able to go back home again.
*07:42.320- 07:44.120* :  Classrooms have now become bedrooms.
*07:44.860- 07:47.800* :  Instead of tables and chairs, mattresses on the floor.
*07:52.020- 07:53.360* :  My son carried me.
*07:53.360- 07:55.260* :  There were air strikes where we lived.
*07:55.920- 07:56.880* :  Everybody had left.
*07:57.140- 07:58.360* :  There was nobody there.
*07:59.140- 08:03.380* :  Kaffir, who is 52, cannot walk and travel 13 hours
*08:03.780- 08:06.020* :  with 10 relatives in just one car.
*08:09.360- 08:11.340* :  We were the last people to leave.
*08:11.340- 08:12.920* :  The kids were screaming.
*08:13.560- 08:15.720* :  They were scared and I was scared too.
*08:16.480- 08:18.240* :  What do you think is going to happen next?
*08:18.820- 08:20.400* :  I hope everything calms down.
*08:20.780- 08:22.040* :  I hope there's a solution.
*08:22.620- 08:24.400* :  May God help the people of the South.
*08:24.960- 08:25.840* :  May God help them.
*08:26.680- 08:30.320* :  There's uncertainty and anxiety, but defiance too.
*08:31.140- 08:33.480* :  South Lebanon is a Hezbollah stronghold.
*08:34.040- 08:37.120* :  They may have been weakened, but they still enjoy support.
*08:38.140- 08:41.840* :  65-year-old Maryam had not time to take anything with her.
*08:43.780- 08:45.040* :  Our men make us proud.
*08:45.700- 08:48.480* :  If it wasn't for them, we would have been crushed a long time ago.
*08:49.360- 08:52.080* :  May God destroy Israel and whoever is on their side.
*08:52.860- 08:56.200* :  We hope to be victorious, not to be humiliated.
*08:57.000- 09:00.120* :  And with God's help, we will be victorious.
*09:01.020- 09:04.580* :  And if we have to leave our homes for that to happen, so be it.
*09:07.400- 09:09.040* :  This country has been paralyzed,
*09:09.600- 09:11.900* :  but it's not only the present that is in doubt.
*09:12.560- 09:13.820* :  It's also its future.
*09:14.520- 09:17.520* :  Salam, who is only eight, came to talk to us
*09:17.840- 09:19.780* :  when she saw our camera and microphone.
*09:24.320- 09:26.020* :  I'm very scared, she said.
*09:26.820- 09:28.720* :  She's too young to understand this war,
*09:29.340- 09:31.340* :  but her life will be changed by it.
*09:32.720- 09:37.140* :  Hugo Bashega in Beirut, the U.S. Secretary of State and New Blinken has
*09:37.140- 09:40.880* :  insisted the U.S. is working hard to de-escalate the situation.
*09:41.260- 09:43.020* :  He's been speaking to CBS News.
*10:11.680- 10:15.600* :  Starting on October 8th, Hezbollah and the North from Southern Lebanon
*10:15.600- 10:18.420* :  started loving rockets and missiles into Israel.
*10:19.160- 10:22.520* :  People living in Northern Israel had to flee their homes, about 70,000.
*10:22.960- 10:25.780* :  And Israel, understandably, legitimately, wants a secure environment
*10:25.780- 10:26.880* :  so people can return home.
*10:27.140- 10:31.640* :  The best way to get that is through diplomacy and agreement to pull back forces,
*10:32.080- 10:33.840* :  allow people to return home in Northern Israel.
*10:34.140- 10:37.020* :  Also, many Lebanese in Southern Lebanon forced from their homes.
*10:42.600- 10:47.020* :  The Civil War in Sudan that broke out in April last year has killed thousands of people
*10:47.020- 10:48.140* :  and displaced millions.
*10:48.140- 10:50.940* :  There have been several warnings about the risk of famine.
*10:51.200- 10:54.840* :  Now, the medical charity MSF has published a new report on the situation
*10:54.840- 10:57.180* :  in the Sudanese region of South Darfur.
*10:57.600- 10:59.240* :  And it makes for pretty grim reading.
*10:59.240- 11:02.960* :  As I heard from our Africa security correspondent Ian Wafoula.
*11:03.440- 11:05.460* :  Andrew, you've just described as a grim reading.
*11:05.460- 11:08.880* :  And actually, the MSF says that the world's worst,
*11:08.880- 11:13.040* :  maternal and child health emergency is actually happening in Sudan.
*11:13.040- 11:15.900* :  And that's because a report they just released today found
*11:15.900- 11:18.600* :  that women and children are dying at a shocking rate.
*11:19.060- 11:22.600* :  It further explains that between the months of January and August,
*11:23.340- 11:25.520* :  two hospitals, particularly in South Darfur,
*11:25.520- 11:27.800* :  recorded 46 maternal deaths.
*11:27.800- 11:31.340* :  And remember, we're just talking about one state and just two hospitals.
*11:31.340- 11:34.580* :  So this number could be far high within the entire country.
*11:34.580- 11:37.580* :  That is why the MSF is kind of sounding the alarm here
*11:37.580- 11:39.220* :  and saying that this is actually happening.
*11:39.580- 11:42.480* :  And they're going to the extent of calling the United Nations
*11:42.480- 11:46.420* :  to actually ensure that this war comes to end in the tour
*11:46.420- 11:48.500* :  inside kind of put their differences aside.
*11:48.500- 11:50.000* :  And remember that at the end of the day,
*11:50.320- 11:53.580* :  it's the people who are hurting from this conflict,
*11:53.700- 11:57.080* :  especially now, the MSF emphasizes women and children.
*11:57.420- 11:59.380* :  And in fact, they go ahead to say that actually,
*11:59.660- 12:01.140* :  these deaths could have been preventable
*12:01.560- 12:03.540* :  because most of them happened in circumstances
*12:03.540- 12:06.200* :  where medical facilities have been run down
*12:06.200- 12:07.860* :  as a result of the war and rule.
*12:08.000- 12:10.300* :  So on the one hand, we've got the famine.
*12:10.440- 12:13.460* :  On the other, we've got the collapse really of health care,
*12:13.460- 12:16.280* :  particularly maternal health care in that part of Sudan.
*12:17.180- 12:18.180* :  Yeah, that's right.
*12:18.180- 12:22.100* :  And another thing that the aid agencies are also trying to figure out
*12:22.120- 12:26.320* :  is how do you deliver life-saving medical equipment
*12:26.320- 12:29.040* :  or drugs that are needed to areas that have been affected
*12:29.040- 12:32.180* :  by conflict at the same time protect their very own personnel?
*12:32.180- 12:35.120* :  Because we've had instances where humanitarian aid workers
*12:35.120- 12:37.580* :  themselves have fallen victim to the war.
*12:37.920- 12:40.300* :  And so these are some of the issues that aid agencies
*12:40.300- 12:43.560* :  like Dr. Zalbotas or MSF are trying to navigate
*12:43.560- 12:44.760* :  as the war continues.
*12:45.140- 12:46.980* :  And certainly even as conversations happen
*12:46.980- 12:49.620* :  at the United Nations General Assembly right now,
*12:49.900- 12:52.880* :  definitely focus is on whether wars or conflicts
*12:52.880- 12:54.880* :  such as that of Sudan will be addressed.
*12:55.560- 12:57.300* :  Ian Wathula with me from Nairobi.
*12:57.960- 13:01.380* :  The rapid fall from grace of the American rapper Sean Combs
*13:01.380- 13:02.980* :  has made headlines around the world.
*13:02.980- 13:06.300* :  Combs, also known as PDD, was arrested last week
*13:06.300- 13:08.840* :  and charged with offenses including sex trafficking.
*13:09.560- 13:12.020* :  Now another woman, Talia Graves, has come forward
*13:12.020- 13:13.120* :  accusing him of rape.
*13:13.680- 13:16.680* :  At a news conference, she said the assault had left her feeling worthless.
*13:17.440- 13:20.920* :  The internal pain after being sexually assaulted
*13:21.960- 13:25.200* :  has been incredibly deep and hard to put into words.
*13:25.940- 13:29.620* :  Because beyond just physical harm caused by
*13:30.080- 13:34.360* :  and during the assault, it's a pain that reaches
*13:34.360- 13:36.940* :  into your very core of who you are
*13:37.620- 13:41.820* :  and leaving emotional scars that may never fully heal
*13:42.640- 13:46.100* :  some of the hardest parts of this pain,
*13:46.700- 13:50.300* :  the shame and the guilt, being blamed,
*13:50.380- 13:56.140* :  questioned and threatened, has often made me feel worthless.
*13:57.300- 14:01.780* :  Al-Asangely's reporter Samantha Granville told us more about what Talia Graves said.
*14:02.280- 14:04.740* :  Throughout the press conference, she was fighting back tears
*14:05.000- 14:08.520* :  and there was some extremely graphic claims outlined by her attorney
*14:08.520- 14:11.420* :  and then also detailed in the lawsuit that they filed.
*14:12.060- 14:15.320* :  And she alleges that Diddy and his associates gave her a drink
*14:15.320- 14:17.980* :  that was likely laced and caused her to lose consciousness.
*14:18.660- 14:20.920* :  And when she woke up, she said she was bound and restrained
*14:20.920- 14:22.880* :  and could not leave the situation.
*14:23.440- 14:28.660* :  The suit also says that Diddy and his bodyguard brutally sexually abused
*14:28.840- 14:32.960* :  and violated her and despite her cries of pain, they just refuse to stop.
*14:33.580- 14:36.660* :  So as you just heard in the clip, Talia has suffered emotionally.
*14:36.660- 14:39.560* :  You can hear it in her voice and she said she's had suicidal thoughts
*14:39.560- 14:41.400* :  and still lives in fear of the incident
*14:41.880- 14:44.500* :  and has been suffering from depression and anxiety
*14:44.500- 14:46.000* :  and panic attacks ever since.
*14:46.540- 14:49.480* :  Why has it taken so long for these allegations to surface?
*14:50.320- 14:54.160* :  Well, according to the lawsuit, Talia said she was threatened by Diddy
*14:54.300- 14:56.140* :  so she didn't want to speak out.
*14:56.320- 14:59.460* :  She was scared that he would use his power to ruin her life
*14:59.460- 15:02.400* :  as he had said explicitly to her.
*15:02.560- 15:05.740* :  And let's not forget the power that P Diddy held for so long.
*15:05.740- 15:09.380* :  For decades, he was considered the hip hop industry himself.
*15:09.980- 15:13.860* :  So to go out and speak against him and to make claims against him
*15:13.860- 15:17.400* :  was just really daunting and he was seen as untouchable
*15:17.400- 15:18.740* :  for a really, really long time.
*15:19.560- 15:22.780* :  P Diddy Shorn comes is currently in prison.
*15:22.780- 15:27.420* :  Where are we with the investigations into what are now numerous allegations?
*15:28.300- 15:31.920* :  Prosecutors say they've interviewed more than 50 victims in witnesses
*15:31.920- 15:37.540* :  to P Diddy's ongoing abuse and that they expect more people to likely come forward.
*15:38.080- 15:40.800* :  It's really a race to get to the witnesses at this point.
*15:40.800- 15:44.100* :  So they'll be looking at his inner circle to see who knew what,
*15:44.680- 15:45.760* :  who acted in what way.
*15:46.000- 15:48.480* :  And though people don't like to rat out their friends,
*15:48.480- 15:51.340* :  I think we'll see that lips will loosen pretty quickly
*15:51.340- 15:53.460* :  when the threat of prison is on the table.
*15:54.180- 15:56.680* :  As for Diddy, he's been denied bail twice.
*15:56.780- 16:00.540* :  His lawyers tried to appeal it saying he could be put on house arrest
*16:00.540- 16:01.760* :  until his trial starts.
*16:02.240- 16:05.220* :  No female visitors would be allowed to come visit him at his house.
*16:05.220- 16:07.080* :  It could be a $50 million bond.
*16:07.080- 16:08.600* :  And the judge said no.
*16:08.600- 16:12.600* :  He just doesn't trust that Diddy will act with good behavior waiting for trial.
*16:12.600- 16:15.620* :  So P Diddy sitting in prison in New York,
*16:15.620- 16:17.100* :  he's waiting for his next court date.
*16:17.300- 16:20.220* :  And it's very likely that he's seen his last days of free man.
*16:21.200- 16:23.300* :  Samantha Grahamville talking to Alex Ritson.
*16:23.940- 16:27.600* :  Fidel Castro famously called Cuba the safest country in the world.
*16:27.780- 16:30.540* :  When it came to the island's low rate of violent crime,
*16:30.540- 16:31.460* :  he may have had a point.
*16:32.060- 16:34.000* :  In recent months, crime has been worsening.
*16:34.000- 16:36.260* :  Official government statistics remain low.
*16:36.260- 16:38.660* :  But many believe they don't reflect the reality.
*16:38.660- 16:42.200* :  More and more victims have reported their experiences on social media
*16:42.560- 16:44.920* :  from muggings at knife point to gang violence.
*16:44.920- 16:47.560* :  And adding to the problem is a cheap new drug
*16:48.140- 16:49.700* :  as well grant reports from Havana.
*16:53.720- 16:55.920* :  In the low income Havana neighborhood of Kaya,
*16:55.920- 16:58.720* :  Wesson, friends of an aspiring music producer,
*16:58.900- 17:01.940* :  called the Jan Franco, gathered to send him off in song.
*17:02.940- 17:05.120* :  Just 19 years old when he was killed,
*17:05.120- 17:07.360* :  Jan was stabbed twice in the chest,
*17:07.460- 17:10.080* :  following a disagreement outside a recording studio,
*17:10.920- 17:13.420* :  caught in the middle when one of the youths pulled a knife.
*17:14.140- 17:17.740* :  Another tragic killing on the traditionally safe Caribbean island.
*17:20.960- 17:24.980* :  A month on, his older sister Samantha remains in a state of numb grief.
*17:28.000- 17:30.860* :  She scrolls through photos of Jan Franco on her computer.
*17:31.440- 17:34.240* :  She says her brother's murder has torn a hole in her family.
*17:35.380- 17:38.800* :  Yet Jan Franco is just one of many to have been killed in recent months
*17:38.800- 17:42.300* :  over trivial arguments and gang rivalries says Samantha.
*17:44.660- 17:47.100* :  So many young people have been killed this year.
*17:47.680- 17:49.340* :  The violence is getting out of hand.
*17:49.900- 17:52.860* :  They are basically gangs and that's where it's all coming from.
*17:56.700- 18:01.540* :  To these gangs often solve their quarrels with knives and machetes, I asked her.
*18:03.420- 18:06.680* :  Yes, almost no one settles an argument with their fists anymore.
*18:07.180- 18:09.580* :  It's all knives, machetes, even gangs.
*18:10.260- 18:11.700* :  Things are just done understand.
*18:13.100- 18:15.680* :  Samantha adds that a new drug called chemical,
*18:16.320- 18:18.640* :  a cheap chemical high with a cannabis base,
*18:19.160- 18:22.720* :  is increasingly popular among Cuban youth in the parks and on the streets.
*18:26.960- 18:31.220* :  Previously just saying that Cuba has a problem with street drugs and violent crime,
*18:31.220- 18:34.420* :  especially to a foreign journalist could land you in trouble.
*18:35.180- 18:38.960* :  The authorities in Havana have always played down the social problems on the island
*18:38.960- 18:44.000* :  and been quick to paint any criticism of their communist system as anti-revolutionary lines
*18:44.000- 18:46.420* :  originating from Miami or Washington.
*18:51.400- 18:55.060* :  But such has been the perception of a sharp drop in public security that
*18:55.180- 18:58.540* :  top government officials had to acknowledge the problem on state TV,
*18:59.380- 19:01.440* :  including a discussion of the drug chemical.
*19:02.060- 19:08.000* :  On air, the government claimed just 9% of crimes in Cuba are violent and just 3% are murders.
*19:09.060- 19:12.800* :  However, there is a serious lack of transparency over government crimes statistics.
*19:13.820- 19:17.220* :  In large part, the Cuban state continues to blame the old enemy,
*19:17.220- 19:22.780* :  the United States for both the presence of opioids on the island and for the US embargo,
*19:22.780- 19:28.380* :  which they argue has made economic life in Cuba so dire that some are turning to crime.
*19:31.800- 19:36.000* :  Most people in Cuba, it seems, have either recently been a victim of opportunistic theft
*19:36.140- 19:39.740* :  themselves or have a friend, neighbor or relative who has been.
*19:40.540- 19:46.560* :  Many remain wary of talking publicly, but Shida Gonzalez, a transgender activist in Cuba,
*19:46.560- 19:52.320* :  is used to speaking out and says her story of being robbed at knife point is now common.
*19:53.040- 19:56.960* :  It was the response by the police, which disillusioned her the most she adds.
*19:59.640- 20:03.700* :  After the attack, I came across two motorbike police officers in a nearby street.
*20:04.440- 20:07.700* :  I was very distressed and said to them, look what just happened to me,
*20:08.100- 20:11.500* :  but they directly told me we're not here for stuff like that.
*20:11.580- 20:17.260* :  It was such an awful thing to hear because I told them where they could find the attacker,
*20:17.660- 20:19.640* :  but they just didn't pay any attention to me.
*20:22.460- 20:26.240* :  In contrast to their raucous singing, when the moment came to Lodiam,
*20:26.240- 20:32.380* :  Franco onto the hearse, his friends showed at his coffin in hushed tones and tearful murmurings.
*20:33.160- 20:37.100* :  Cuba's youth face more difficulties growing up than most in the Caribbean,
*20:37.800- 20:40.360* :  and many have fled in search of greater opportunities.
*20:41.260- 20:44.420* :  Those that stay must now contend with rising crime too,
*20:45.080- 20:48.220* :  as another pillar of the Cuban Revolution, public safety,
*20:48.660- 20:52.260* :  now looks more unstable than at any other time since the Cold War.
*20:54.600- 20:55.740* :  We'll grant in Havana.
*20:57.780- 20:58.860* :  Still to come in this podcast?
*21:00.980- 21:04.240* :  Well, the Americans say moog, the Dutch say moog,
*21:04.640- 21:09.220* :  and we didn't really know how to pronounce it when the instruments first arrived,
*21:09.980- 21:11.280* :  so we call them moogs.
*21:11.460- 21:15.080* :  An ode to the keyboard that's the cornerstone of many pop classics.
*21:21.980- 21:25.020* :  Explaining football to the friend who's just there for the nachos?
*21:25.540- 21:30.140* :  Hard. Tailgating from home like a pro with snacks and drinks everyone will love,
*21:30.700- 21:31.560* :  any easy win.

*22:39.600- 22:43.580* :  China has launched an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean.
*22:44.020- 22:48.120* :  The country's defense ministry said the missile which was carrying a dummy warhead wasn't
*22:48.120- 22:50.140* :  directed at any country or target.
*22:50.140- 22:55.060* :  But the test has added to international unease about China's growing nuclear arsenal.
*22:55.600- 23:00.060* :  The government of Japan said the lack of transparency around the issue was a serious concern.
*23:00.060- 23:03.800* :  Australia said it was seeking an explanation for the missile launch.
*23:04.260- 23:07.240* :  Our China correspondent Stephen McDonnell has been telling me more.
*23:07.720- 23:12.540* :  Well at first blush you can imagine people thinking there goes an intercontinental ballistic
*23:12.540- 23:17.340* :  missile from China or a test and it may be seen as a show of strength.
*23:18.520- 23:22.100* :  I guess against the US, Europe or whoever.
*23:23.340- 23:25.340* :  But really it could be something much worse than that.
*23:25.400- 23:29.000* :  Because let's assume for the moment the China actually needed to do this test.
*23:29.600- 23:31.360* :  Well why might it need to do that?
*23:31.740- 23:35.320* :  Because it already has all these nuclear weapons already has missiles.
*23:36.000- 23:42.700* :  Because this is new gear, new warheads, new missiles which can go much further,
*23:43.160- 23:45.460* :  further and in much greater numbers.
*23:47.040- 23:52.260* :  Tests like this at least officially haven't been carried out for decades from China.
*23:52.260- 23:59.720* :  And so it would only be if you are significantly expanding your nuclear weapons capabilities
*23:59.820- 24:01.920* :  that you would need to do such tests.
*24:02.540- 24:07.140* :  And that's what has people worried, especially given that Washington and Beijing
*24:07.980- 24:14.960* :  around a year ago started nuclear arms talks again only to see them collapse a few months ago
*24:15.380- 24:20.280* :  after the Chinese government accused the US of supplying too many arms to Taiwan.
*24:20.860- 24:24.400* :  Okay so there's obviously concern about China having new warheads.
*24:25.120- 24:28.580* :  What's the worry in terms of the context in which they could be used?
*24:30.780- 24:34.560* :  Well not only new but more, lots of them and they can go further.
*24:34.560- 24:40.200* :  So because in the past China's already said we would never use nuclear weapons as a first option.
*24:40.260- 24:47.920* :  And it compared to Russia and the US, its nuclear capabilities have been much smaller.
*24:48.620- 24:51.260* :  Well now we're seeing Xi Jinping changing all that.
*24:51.260- 24:55.600* :  The rocket force here is vastly expanding a lot more money going into this.
*24:56.480- 24:59.860* :  We've had the Japanese government saying today this is a serious concern.
*24:59.860- 25:03.860* :  And although China warned other countries, it didn't warned Japan about this test,
*25:04.260- 25:07.300* :  but that could be because this particular missile, test missile at least,
*25:07.660- 25:09.440* :  didn't fly over Japanese land.
*25:10.180- 25:11.580* :  Steve McDonald in Beijing.
*25:12.380- 25:16.640* :  Garners' persistent cost of living crisis is set to be a dominant issue in the
*25:16.640- 25:19.800* :  West African countries upcoming general election in December.
*25:20.360- 25:24.660* :  And with food prices continuing to surge, some people are coming up with innovative ways
*25:24.660- 25:27.980* :  to feed their families from Akra, here's Thomas Naughty.
*25:28.360- 25:33.100* :  So the first thing we have to do is to wash your what's on their lawns and then the vegetables
*25:33.100- 25:35.060* :  that you'll be using and the running water.
*25:35.060- 25:41.000* :  LNGBAR4 is a 30-year-old Iranian food content creator from Takra Day in Western Ghana.
*25:42.020- 25:45.340* :  Xi has found a non-conventional solution to cope with price hikes,
*25:45.740- 25:48.740* :  replacing tomatoes with watermelon in her local recipes.
*25:49.660- 25:55.400* :  I'm going to the Jubilee Market in Takra Day to shop some ingredients for my water melon stew.
*25:56.260- 25:59.440* :  And I choose water melon because I think it's quite affordable.
*26:01.660- 26:05.060* :  The latest inflation figures released by the government show that
*26:05.560- 26:09.720* :  prices of food items like vegetables have gone up by 37%.
*26:10.140- 26:14.500* :  So LNGBAR4 has been teaching a social media followers how to prepare
*26:14.500- 26:17.380* :  water melon stew to cope with the high prices of tomatoes.
*26:17.800- 26:23.420* :  Therefore, for one minute and then pour in your water melon pep pep mix, okay?
*26:23.880- 26:29.060* :  And then I used to go to the market every day just to get fresh goose for my videos.
*26:29.060- 26:35.480* :  But now I do stock the house because I know each and every day there will be different prices
*26:35.700- 26:36.480* :  on food items.
*26:37.060- 26:41.160* :  The government started a planting for food and jobs initiative in 2017.
*26:41.820- 26:45.960* :  But that hasn't done enough to solve the problem of high cost of food in the country.
*26:46.780- 26:49.180* :  A legal money has destroyed farmlands.
*26:49.780- 26:54.600* :  Poor road networks linking farms to urban areas have contributed to 40%
*26:54.640- 26:56.140* :  pus harvest losses.
*26:57.980- 27:00.980* :  I'm at the Jubilee Market, one of the biggest in the Ghanaian capital,
*27:00.980- 27:04.460* :  Akra. A number of food items are on display here.
*27:04.460- 27:11.320* :  We have tomatoes, we have pep pep, we have the inflation has slowed down in this country
*27:11.320- 27:15.660* :  in recent months. But food prices remain high.
*27:16.000- 27:21.640* :  The government and the IMF have said that the economy is showing signs of improvement.
*27:22.380- 27:26.380* :  But it's here to reflect in the pockets of ordinary Ghanaians.
*27:27.560- 27:30.240* :  The economy's professor Godfrey Bocke explains.
*27:30.240- 27:34.620* :  There's a possibility that inflation may not come down significantly.
*27:34.940- 27:39.560* :  Beyond that, if you want to complement the limited domestic supply,
*27:39.560- 27:43.340* :  you want to import a little bit more, you don't have the effects.
*27:44.060- 27:46.520* :  You don't have the foreign currency to meet that demand.
*27:47.920- 27:53.120* :  Ghana has to the cause this December in a heated contest between two popular canadiens.
*27:53.540- 27:56.880* :  Both focus on how to resolve the country's economic crisis.
*27:57.440- 28:01.780* :  Ghanaians are hopeful that the economy will bounce back when the new government
*28:01.780- 28:03.720* :  takes office in January next year.
*28:04.320- 28:09.520* :  Tomas Nadi in Akra. President Joe Biden has announced that the US will donate a million
*28:09.520- 28:15.380* :  doses of MPOX vaccine and $500 million to help the response to MPOX in Africa.
*28:16.000- 28:20.140* :  The Democratic Republic of Congo is the country most severely affected by the latest outbreak,
*28:20.140- 28:22.100* :  which has killed more than 700 people.
*28:22.740- 28:25.780* :  A quarter of a million vaccines have already been distributed there.
*28:25.780- 28:30.280* :  And one of two companies approved to manufacture them is Denmark's Bavarian Nordic.
*28:30.600- 28:32.460* :  We have from its CEO Paul Chaplin.
*28:32.900- 28:38.160* :  We've told the world that we have changed our manufacturing focus to make two million doses
*28:38.680- 28:39.580* :  available this year.
*28:40.180- 28:44.820* :  As we sit here today, I doubt we will supply all that to a million this year.
*28:45.480- 28:48.460* :  So you're saying you will have vaccinations made.
*28:48.460- 28:49.680* :  There will be doses made.
*28:50.400- 28:55.140* :  There will be people in DR Congo and elsewhere who need those vaccinations.
*28:55.140- 28:59.720* :  But there isn't anybody in the middle willing to pay and therefore receive them.
*29:00.120- 29:01.700* :  Well, currently that looks like situation.
*29:01.900- 29:06.680* :  Yes, but we are at the beginning of the declaration of a public emergency.
*29:06.680- 29:10.120* :  And it does take the international community and our experience
*29:10.640- 29:12.960* :  time to get moving.
*29:13.500- 29:18.220* :  We see ourselves as part of a solution and could further expand our capability
*29:18.220- 29:19.480* :  should we need to.
*29:20.020- 29:22.260* :  But at the moment, that doesn't seem that it's required.
*29:22.700- 29:25.820* :  My colleague James Coppnell spoke to Dr. A. O. R. D. Alakija,
*29:26.120- 29:29.980* :  chair of the African Vaccine Delivery Alliance who told him vaccines are welcome,
*29:29.980- 29:31.500* :  but only part of the answer.
*29:32.080- 29:34.380* :  The reality is that we aid the world cannot produce
*29:34.820- 29:38.820* :  enough vaccines in time to, to, to, to curtail an outbreak.
*29:38.820- 29:44.140* :  Nor can we vaccinate, you know, hundreds of millions of people in time to curtail an outbreak.
*29:44.140- 29:50.080* :  The only way to stop outbreaks is to stop them or to stop academics becoming pandemics is to stop
*29:50.080- 29:52.300* :  outbreaks in the communities where they begin.
*29:52.580- 29:56.820* :  The only way to do that is by strengthening health systems, by having diagnostic testing,
*29:56.820- 30:01.960* :  by having rapid testing so that when people notice the symptoms and the signs of a disease,
*30:01.960- 30:04.640* :  that they can immediately go and get a test.
*30:04.640- 30:09.780* :  And if people don't have access to that, then like COVID, people go out and they spread it.
*30:09.780- 30:13.020* :  And, and this is happening in truckers and in workers.
*30:13.020- 30:17.460* :  Very similar sort of spread to HIV in its early days.
*30:17.680- 30:20.800* :  So people are having a test, sort of, are noticing a symptom.
*30:20.800- 30:24.660* :  The only test available for most of them are long-term PCR,
*30:24.660- 30:27.800* :  where they don't get the results for weeks and weeks.
*30:28.140- 30:30.080* :  And so by the time the results come,
*30:30.080- 30:33.480* :  and they know that they're actually infected and potentially infectious,
*30:34.060- 30:35.020* :  that they're long gone.
*30:35.020- 30:37.700* :  They've maybe gone through three or four countries,
*30:38.320- 30:40.900* :  and perhaps infected a whole trail of people.
*30:41.220- 30:44.580* :  But if we're looking at, for example, the ESA, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*30:44.580- 30:48.420* :  which has been really the epicenter of this end-porks outbreak,
*30:48.900- 30:53.540* :  this is a place where health systems are in disarray to be polite,
*30:53.540- 30:56.960* :  where there is conflict, where there are so many challenges.
*30:56.960- 31:01.900* :  If one of the ways of dealing with it is improving the health service and health delivery,
*31:02.520- 31:04.660* :  and so on, that's not something that's going to happen overnight.
*31:05.740- 31:07.660* :  No, but this is what we should be focusing on.
*31:07.660- 31:10.960* :  We'd, I mean, health systems are improving in many parts of Africa.
*31:11.400- 31:13.740* :  I mean, DRC, yes, health systems are in disarray.
*31:13.740- 31:16.420* :  Health systems are in disarray in many parts of Africa.
*31:16.760- 31:21.780* :  Yesterday for the UN General Assembly, I spoke on a panel or co-led a panel
*31:22.100- 31:25.260* :  together with the Japanese government on investing in health.
*31:25.580- 31:27.040* :  And this is exactly what we're saying.
*31:27.040- 31:30.640* :  What we are seeing in DRC and in Nigeria, where I'm from,
*31:30.640- 31:35.300* :  is that we have built on the strengthening of health systems from COVID.
*31:35.640- 31:40.000* :  WHO in Africa, at a meeting I was at in Brazaville just three, four weeks ago,
*31:40.300- 31:44.160* :  told us that they're now lab capabilities, laboratory capabilities,
*31:44.300- 31:49.160* :  foretesting in 40, I think back 47 countries,
*31:49.160- 31:52.580* :  where before they perhaps were only existed in two or three,
*31:52.780- 31:54.860* :  these are the investments from COVID.
*31:55.280- 31:58.340* :  You know, so it doesn't happen overnight, but vaccines also
*31:58.620- 32:02.260* :  are not going to get from people's ports into people's arms overnight.
*32:02.620- 32:05.100* :  You know, there has to be a balance. We have to do both.
*32:05.100- 32:07.200* :  It's not either or it's both hand.
*32:07.480- 32:10.660* :  There are a lot of studies into phone addiction among young people,
*32:10.660- 32:14.620* :  but a new one by the World Health Organization says there's been a sharp rise
*32:14.620- 32:16.740* :  in the use of social media by teenagers.
*32:17.380- 32:21.500* :  Dr. Joe Inchley is co-author of the report and spoke to my colleague, Nick Robinson,
*32:21.820- 32:23.820* :  about how to know if someone has a problem.
*32:24.240- 32:28.020* :  What we're measuring is what we're calling problematic social media use.
*32:28.020- 32:31.060* :  So it is based on addictive-like symptoms,
*32:31.060- 32:34.260* :  but we're not measuring addiction per se, it's important to clarify that.
*32:34.360- 32:36.460* :  So the sort of questions we ask are things like,
*32:37.140- 32:40.200* :  are you always thinking about social media when you're not on it?
*32:40.260- 32:42.320* :  Do you find it hard to come off social media?
*32:42.840- 32:45.480* :  Do you neglect other activities in your lives because of the
*32:45.480- 32:48.280* :  amount of time you're spending on social media and do you find yourself
*32:48.740- 32:51.920* :  maybe lying about the amount of time to family and friends and so on?
*32:51.920- 32:55.220* :  So it's really these sort of this impact that goes
*32:56.180- 33:00.140* :  that seeps into other areas of their lives and has a negative effect on, for example,
*33:01.060- 33:05.000* :  activities outside the home and also their relationships in their life.
*33:06.060- 33:08.840* :  And the other thing that comes out of the report is that the numbers
*33:09.660- 33:13.780* :  displaying that attitude to social media has increased in his
*33:14.140- 33:16.180* :  higher hair than in many other countries in the world.
*33:17.340- 33:23.140* :  Yeah, so the study includes 44 countries and we are seeing a sort of increase across the board
*33:23.140- 33:26.200* :  in problematic social media use, particularly amongst girls.
*33:26.200- 33:29.080* :  But in the UK and England and Scotland in particular,
*33:29.660- 33:33.160* :  we've seen a more marked increase over the last four years.
*33:33.280- 33:37.500* :  So now, over one in five, 13-year-old girls in Scotland and England report
*33:37.500- 33:40.100* :  these problematic social media use behaviors.
*33:41.360- 33:44.320* :  Now, three pop songs, thriller by Michael Jackson,
*33:44.320- 33:46.020* :  Dancing Queen by Abba.
*33:46.420- 33:48.520* :  I feel love by Donna Summer.
*33:48.520- 33:52.540* :  One thing they have in common is the MOOG, a classic synthesizer,
*33:52.820- 33:54.900* :  which is celebrating its 60th anniversary.
*33:55.540- 33:57.800* :  When the most popular one, the Mini MOOG ceased production.
*33:57.860- 33:59.960* :  It was feared it was a sound that was going to disappear.
*34:00.500- 34:02.820* :  But the passion of its fans have led to a revival.
*34:03.300- 34:05.980* :  David Cilato has been to meet the MOOG ensemble.
*34:06.580- 34:07.620* :  Yeah, let's go to Hamburg.
*34:09.020- 34:09.260* :  Okay.
*34:14.760- 34:17.040* :  We're in a garage in a secret location.
*34:20.580- 34:23.640* :  And I am surrounded by MOOGs.
*34:26.620- 34:30.220* :  This is the MOOG ensemble, led by Will Gregory from Guildfram.
*34:35.120- 34:37.420* :  Key thing, MOOG, MOOG.
*34:38.240- 34:41.620* :  Well, the Americans say MOOG, the Dutch say MOOG,
*34:41.920- 34:45.220* :  and we didn't really know how to pronounce it
*34:45.260- 34:46.620* :  when the instruments first arrived.
*34:47.260- 34:48.540* :  So we call them MOOGs.
*34:48.720- 34:51.040* :  And Will loves his MOOGs.
*34:51.260- 34:56.140* :  But to help understand why, you agreed to introduce me to his original MOOG.
*34:56.560- 34:57.960* :  How many synthesizers have you got?
*34:58.680- 34:59.120* :  Too many.
*35:00.280- 35:01.980* :  I've counted a lot when I've walked in here.
*35:02.440- 35:05.220* :  Yeah, the man cave, I'm sorry, it's a bit embarrassing.
*35:07.000- 35:08.240* :  So this isn't a original Mini.
*35:10.120- 35:11.840* :  It's immediately 70s, isn't it?
*35:13.960- 35:14.440* :  Well, it is.
*35:14.940- 35:18.040* :  It's the future, the sound of the future from the 70s, yeah.
*35:18.600- 35:20.880* :  And I think they had a good visual of the future in the 70s.
*35:20.980- 35:22.900* :  But can I ask how old you MOOGs?
*35:23.280- 35:25.820* :  Well, it's 1972, I think, so.
*35:26.220- 35:27.020* :  52 years old?
*35:27.120- 35:27.340* :  Yeah.
*35:28.240- 35:30.600* :  I hate to say it, but it's big clots out, isn't it?
*35:32.680- 35:34.500* :  It just needs a bit of TLC once in a while.
*35:35.440- 35:37.120* :  The Mini MOOG, the Model D,
*35:37.340- 35:38.940* :  a little wooden clad keyboard
*35:39.720- 35:43.020* :  that has that classic, rich, warm MOOG sound
*35:43.020- 35:46.220* :  that hugs you like a cosmic comfy jumper
*35:47.160- 35:49.000* :  with its trademark base.
*35:50.580- 35:54.140* :  I mean, it's just, you know, all those 70s disco records.
*35:55.140- 35:57.600* :  But when production stopped, there was a fear
*35:57.600- 36:00.720* :  that the MOOG sound would slowly die.
*36:01.080- 36:03.860* :  Let's just play the first until the repeat sign.
*36:04.700- 36:07.800* :  But the passion of Will and his fellow Moogists has prevailed,
*36:07.800- 36:10.660* :  the classic Model D, is back in production.
*36:11.000- 36:11.520* :  Born in?
*36:11.940- 36:14.360* :  And with new MOOGs, there are new converts.
*36:16.760- 36:17.520* :  I'm Hazel Mills.
*36:18.240- 36:19.080* :  I'm in Okamori.
*36:19.160- 36:22.260* :  You and Hazel, you're slightly younger than the average age
*36:22.260- 36:23.420* :  of the rest of the ensemble.
*36:23.780- 36:25.500* :  I don't want to be rude in some way here.
*36:26.240- 36:26.720* :  Honestly.
*36:28.420- 36:32.560* :  Inside and very old, actually, they are beautiful sounding.
*36:34.420- 36:35.600* :  It's got a personality.
*36:35.600- 36:36.920* :  It's got soul.
*36:37.160- 36:37.940* :  Soul, yes.
*36:39.100- 36:41.160* :  We do a bit of Vangelis, a bit of Doctor Hood,
*36:41.760- 36:44.540* :  and, of course, a bit of Wendy.
*36:45.180- 36:45.880* :  Wendy Carlos.
*36:46.180- 36:47.720* :  She is the reason this group exists.
*36:48.360- 36:49.740* :  It was her switched on Bach.
*36:53.320- 36:54.600* :  And Clockwork Orange soundtrack
*36:55.200- 36:57.360* :  that brought the sound of the MOOG to the masses.
*36:57.360- 36:59.380* :  Switched on Bach changed everything.
*36:59.940- 37:01.820* :  And Clockwork Orange still gives me chills.
*37:02.500- 37:03.480* :  Fantastic, yeah.
*37:06.620- 37:08.080* :  Do you know what Wendy makes for this?
*37:08.980- 37:09.860* :  Absolutely no idea.
*37:09.860- 37:11.920* :  Wendy is virtually radio silent.
*37:12.780- 37:15.980* :  And it's obviously retreating into her glory
*37:16.660- 37:18.260* :  without having to muddy the waters.
*37:20.720- 37:24.220* :  So on this 60th anniversary, we have new MOOGs
*37:24.840- 37:29.520* :  and a celebration of the mysterious genius of Wendy Carlos.
*37:33.860- 37:35.660* :  Our answer correspondent, David Sillato.
*37:38.220- 37:39.320* :  And that's all from us for now.
