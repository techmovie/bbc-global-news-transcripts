*00:50.180- 00:54.820* :  if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*00:55.240- 00:57.840* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*00:57.840- 01:02.640* :  honoris to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hollywood
*01:02.640- 01:08.760* :  s**t. So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*01:26.340- 01:30.880* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway and this edition is published in the early hours of Thursday the 26th
*01:30.880- 01:36.080* :  of September. The head of the Israeli military tells troops to be ready for a possible ground
*01:36.080- 01:42.680* :  invasion of Lebanon. We hear from Beirut and Northern Israel. Kenyan police are accused of
*01:42.680- 01:48.760* :  using excessive force when clamping down on protesters in June. And why children's eyesight appears
*01:48.760- 01:57.640* :  to be getting worse. Also in this podcast, the idea long term is that we're going to use a small
*01:57.640- 02:04.380* :  underwater vehicle to do their job. The challenge is to scale it to the Arctic scale, so millions
*02:04.380- 02:08.660* :  or square kilometers. A new plan to tackle melting ice sheets.
*02:13.920- 02:19.380* :  Is Israel preparing for a ground invasion of Lebanon? It certainly looks that way,
*02:19.380- 02:24.620* :  with the armed forces calling up two reserve brigades for, quote, operational missions in the
*02:24.620- 02:30.420* :  northern arena. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fight would go on until
*02:30.420- 02:33.000* :  northern Israel was safe from Hezbollah attacks.
*02:36.900- 02:43.540* :  I cannot detail everything we are doing, but I can tell you one thing. We are determined to
*02:43.540- 02:50.020* :  return our residents in the north safely to their homes. We are striking Hezbollah with blows.
*02:50.020- 02:56.920* :  It never imagined. We are doing this with full force. We are doing this with strategy.
*02:57.740- 03:02.940* :  One thing I promise you. We will not rest until they return home.
*03:03.360- 03:09.060* :  The head of Israel's armed forces, Heritzi Halavi, was more explicit, telling troops near the
*03:09.060- 03:13.200* :  border with Lebanon that Israeli boots would soon enter enemy territory.
*03:16.220- 03:22.200* :  You hear the planes up here. We are attacking all day. This is both to prepare the ground for your
*03:22.200- 03:28.900* :  potential entry and to continue hitting Hezbollah. Today, Hezbollah has expanded its circle of fire.
*03:29.660- 03:34.300* :  And later in the day, it will receive a very strong response. You will prepare.
*03:35.140- 03:39.420* :  Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams spent the day on Israel's northern border
*03:39.860- 03:42.500* :  and had this assessment of how events may unfold.
*03:43.300- 03:49.240* :  Clearly today did mark a shift because we had the head of the army as you just played that clip,
*03:49.660- 03:56.660* :  saying publicly for the first time that Israeli troops may end up on the ground inside southern
*03:56.660- 04:01.860* :  Lebanon. This is something that the head of Israel's northern command is said to favor the
*04:01.860- 04:07.680* :  creation of some kind of buffer zone along the northern border. And so here we have someone on
*04:07.680- 04:12.860* :  camera that the head of the army is saying that this could happen. The reason obviously is because
*04:13.760- 04:19.460* :  I think there is a recognition that despite the absolute pounding that the Israeli Air Force
*04:19.460- 04:24.860* :  is delivering and has been delivering for the last several days on Hezbollah's forces in southern
*04:24.860- 04:30.900* :  Lebanon and elsewhere in Lebanon, the notion that you can clear them away from the border
*04:31.460- 04:38.100* :  adequately without sending troops in is pretty unlikely. We were in Kiryat Shimonad and just
*04:38.100- 04:44.660* :  north of here right next to the Lebanese border earlier today. We saw a town deserted. We saw
*04:45.480- 04:51.280* :  rockets fired from across the border being intercepted overhead. Reminders that the situation
*04:51.280- 04:56.920* :  along the border remains completely untenable. And the Israeli government is saying emphatically
*04:56.920- 05:03.920* :  that it's war aim, it's principle war aim, frankly at the moment, is to bring Israeli citizens
*05:03.920- 05:10.200* :  back to their homes along the northern border. And it is unlikely that that can happen without
*05:10.200- 05:16.460* :  some kind of either diplomatic breakthrough or if that doesn't work, some kind of military
*05:16.460- 05:23.140* :  incursion on the ground. No one with any institutional memory within the Israeli defense forces
*05:24.200- 05:30.780* :  will relish the prospect of going back into southern Lebanon. There was the war in 2006, but of course
*05:31.880- 05:37.460* :  before that in the 80s and 90s, a 20 year occupation of southern Lebanon and attempt
*05:38.100- 05:46.920* :  to create an ally with the Christian forces in Lebanon. It all cost a great deal of blood and
*05:46.920- 05:53.860* :  treasure. The Israeli public became profoundly disillusioned with it and eventually in the year 2000,
*05:53.860- 06:00.460* :  the Israeli military pulled out. I remember watching the last Israeli soldier closing the gate
*06:00.460- 06:08.160* :  as the troops finally left, much to there and the Israeli public's relief. So if the government
*06:08.160- 06:13.040* :  is thinking of going back in on the ground now, it is going to have to sell this in a way that
*06:13.040- 06:19.200* :  the Israeli public will buy. Paul Adams in northern Israel, well over the border in Lebanon,
*06:19.200- 06:24.900* :  people are desperate to get away from the Israeli air attacks. This British resident of Beirut,
*06:24.900- 06:29.880* :  whose Lebanese husband is disabled, says the sense of fear in the capital is palpable.
*06:30.700- 06:36.740* :  On West Beirut, from everything that you will have seen and heard about the atrocities
*06:36.840- 06:45.160* :  of last week, mean that people are very, very afraid and you can taste the fear in the air.
*06:45.740- 06:54.180* :  It's all around and of course those live in the south of Beirut and are having to evacuate
*06:55.200- 07:02.260* :  are coming to Beirut in huge numbers to try and find family and friends or sanctuary in
*07:02.260- 07:07.720* :  some sort of safe area. So it's tension, it's tension all around.
*07:08.660- 07:14.520* :  A third of Lebanon's population come from families that have already fled their homes at least once,
*07:14.520- 07:20.680* :  either in Syria or many years ago on land that now forms part of Israel, Gaza or the occupied
*07:20.680- 07:25.900* :  West Bank. They're now being joined by thousands of internally displaced Lebanese.
*07:26.180- 07:30.940* :  Jan Eglon, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, says Lebanon is on the brink.
*07:31.520- 07:39.380* :  This society will break. Beirut is so overwhelmed, so are the other cities. It has to stop,
*07:39.380- 07:45.720* :  this madness has to stop. We are, as aid organizations, incapable of meeting the new needs.
*07:45.720- 07:53.880* :  It's unbearable. There is no real options but to end this enormous aerial campaign against
*07:53.880- 08:00.400* :  Lebanon and of course, Hasbola to stop with these indiscriminate rockets going into Israel.
*08:01.100- 08:05.960* :  And he had this warning for the Western world. Hasbola said that they started with the rockets
*08:06.600- 08:13.900* :  in solidarity with Gaza. I mean, it's not a good way of showing solidarity to send
*08:13.900- 08:22.940* :  indiscriminate rockets anywhere. But indeed, yes, it's a ripple effect and the rest of the world
*08:22.940- 08:30.400* :  does not understand that the West doesn't treat occupational Palestinians like the West is treating
*08:30.400- 08:36.200* :  occupation of Ukrainians. It's seen as industrial scale hypocrisy.
*08:36.700- 08:42.120* :  Jan Eglon, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council. For more on the plight of those caught up in the
*08:42.120- 08:47.520* :  fighting in Lebanon, I spoke to our correspondent in Beirut, Hugo Bichiga. People are exhausted.
*08:47.880- 08:54.500* :  It's been almost a year of this conflict. And I mean, the images of those airstrikes, people
*08:55.140- 09:01.880* :  believe that residential areas have been hit, have been targeted. That civilians are again
*09:01.900- 09:07.560* :  being targeted by these attacks. And obviously, we've seen that tens of thousands of people are now
*09:07.560- 09:12.960* :  trying to leave southern Lebanon. And they're coming to places like Beirut, where schools have
*09:12.960- 09:18.920* :  been turned into shelters, putting a lot of pressure on public services, hospitals as well,
*09:19.280- 09:26.040* :  under a lot of pressure. I actually interviewed the health minister yesterday. And he talked about
*09:26.040- 09:31.800* :  the pressure on the health service, hospitals, places that are struggling to cope with everything
*09:31.800- 09:37.360* :  that's been happening. So far, it seems that the authorities have been able to respond to
*09:37.360- 09:43.400* :  what's happening. But if these attacks continue, you know, the public services may become
*09:43.720- 09:47.800* :  overwhelmed because of the sheer number of people who are in need of help.
*09:48.000- 09:55.140* :  And if it gets worse, if Israel does send in ground forces, how will the civilians respond
*09:55.140- 10:00.680* :  and how will Hezbollah respond? We're seeing now that the attempts by civilians
*10:00.680- 10:07.120* :  in southern Lebanon to leave and to come to places like Beirut continue. And for Hezbollah,
*10:07.120- 10:12.480* :  we haven't heard from the man making those decisions. Hassan Nasrallah, he hasn't given a speech,
*10:12.480- 10:19.700* :  he hasn't really reacted since these airstrikes started. Last week, he gave a speech. And essentially,
*10:19.700- 10:26.860* :  he said, you can invade and we are ready to fight. And Hezbollah has been saying they have surprises,
*10:27.520- 10:33.640* :  ready for the Israelis if there is an invasion. But I think it's a very difficult situation for them
*10:33.640- 10:39.480* :  because they've been weakened, they've been degraded, that communication network has been infiltrated,
*10:39.480- 10:44.580* :  that military leadership has essentially been decimated. So I think it's going to be very
*10:44.580- 10:49.740* :  difficult for them to try to organize any kind of significant response if there is a grounding
*10:49.740- 10:54.700* :  invasion. But we'll see. It does feel tonight though that we're closer to this possible
*10:54.700- 10:59.340* :  grounding invasion by the Israeli military. You go, but Jager in Beirut.
*11:00.440- 11:05.920* :  The Ukrainian president has accused Russia of planning attacks on Ukraine's nuclear power facilities.
*11:05.920- 11:11.680* :  Vladimir Zelensky was speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York. He's hoping to use the
*11:11.680- 11:17.620* :  visit to secure continued support from international allies. Russia hasn't commented. Our correspondent
*11:17.620- 11:23.540* :  in Kiev, Jessica Parker, has more details. The message was designed to be stark. President
*11:23.540- 11:28.760* :  Zelensky used his UN address to emphasize a claim by Kiev that Russia has been obtaining
*11:28.760- 11:35.080* :  images and information about Ukraine's nuclear power plants. He said Moscow may be plotting to
*11:35.080- 11:42.040* :  attack these sites to disconnect them from the energy grid. If God forbid Russia causes a nuclear
*11:42.040- 11:49.000* :  disaster at one, one of our nuclear power plants radiation will not respect state borders.
*11:49.720- 11:55.020* :  And unfortunately, various nations could feel their devastating effects.
*11:55.860- 12:00.400* :  Mr. Zelensky is trying to refocus the world's attention on the Russian invasion.
*12:00.880- 12:05.680* :  Tomorrow, he'll have talks with US President Joe Biden in a likely bid to ask for more
*12:05.680- 12:10.720* :  weapon support, financial assistance, and future security guarantees in what's being
*12:10.720- 12:16.540* :  built as a victory plan. It's a timely meeting. As Donald Trump has again suggested,
*12:16.540- 12:22.400* :  he could curtail vital US support for Kiev if he returns to the White House.
*12:22.880- 12:28.520* :  Jessica Parker in Kiev. Well, the US announced a further $375 million
*12:28.520- 12:34.800* :  worth of military aid for Ukraine on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Donald Trump doubled down on his
*12:34.800- 12:40.280* :  opposition to support for the country, accusing Vladimir Zelensky of refusing to make a deal to
*12:40.280- 12:46.460* :  end the war with Russia. He was speaking at an election rally in North Carolina. His democratic
*12:46.460- 12:51.220* :  rival, Kamala Harris, is also on the road, setting out details of her economic policies,
*12:51.220- 12:56.740* :  and a campaign stop in the vital swing state of Pennsylvania. And that's my cue to remind you
*12:56.740- 13:01.780* :  that we are doing a special Q&A podcast on the US presidential election in a couple of weeks.
*13:01.780- 13:06.020* :  So if you have a question you'd like to put to our America's colleagues in Washington,
*13:06.020- 13:13.980* :  then please send us an email to globalpodcastatbbc.co.uk or tweet us at Global NewsPod.
*13:14.200- 13:16.620* :  And thanks to those who have already sent in voice notes.
*13:17.780- 13:23.760* :  The 25th of June was a dark day for Kenya. Six people were killed when police opened fire on
*13:23.760- 13:28.820* :  protesters outside Parliament in Nairobi. They started shooting after failing to disperse the
*13:28.820- 13:33.720* :  demonstrators with tear gas and water cannon. Some protesters who were calling on President
*13:33.720- 13:38.980* :  Ruto to step down over planned tax rises managed to storm the parliamentary building.
*13:39.500- 13:45.220* :  Now Amnesty International says an independent investigation into the shooting is urgently needed
*13:45.220- 13:50.960* :  as I heard from Richard Cagoy in Nairobi. They say that the Kenyan police
*13:51.040- 13:57.600* :  violated the law, applied excessive force against the protesters which led to the deaths of
*13:57.600- 14:03.180* :  six people and hundreds of people who were injured. And so they're saying the conduct of the police
*14:03.180- 14:07.980* :  is in question and that's why they're saying they needed judicial commission of inquiry.
*14:07.980- 14:12.560* :  So then they can establish those who are responsible and they can be held to account.
*14:13.080- 14:18.760* :  And is that likely to happen? Are the authorities expected to agree to an independent inquiry?
*14:19.500- 14:24.020* :  That's the big question because so far the Office of the Attorney General, the police
*14:24.620- 14:29.780* :  have not responded even to questions and inquiries from Amnesty International
*14:29.940- 14:34.580* :  and other Sikhs and Human Rights groups that were investigating this matter.
*14:35.260- 14:39.760* :  It's difficult to see how the police will respond to this because the police have been
*14:39.760- 14:45.740* :  defending themselves saying that they did what they could within their ability at the time
*14:45.740- 14:51.360* :  because they were saying that people who were criminals had infiltrated the protest and so it
*14:51.360- 14:57.720* :  was in their interest to protect businesses and ordinary Kenyans who were exposed to this threat.
*14:57.720- 15:02.660* :  So police have been really very defensive about this and I guess it's just a wait and see.
*15:03.200- 15:07.500* :  Now we're three months on from the events of the 25th of June.
*15:08.380- 15:10.260* :  What is the situation like in Kenya now?
*15:11.040- 15:15.200* :  I think I would describe it realistically as a sense of unease.
*15:15.600- 15:21.320* :  The fact that of course we've had a semblance of order and quietness across the country.
*15:21.320- 15:27.580* :  It seems like the issues that the protesters were raising have not been adequately addressed.
*15:27.760- 15:32.480* :  This way the fact that the current government has seemed to have found a political solution.
*15:32.480- 15:37.440* :  But the issues to do with the economy and especially the majority of the young people who
*15:37.440- 15:42.080* :  are so disenfranchised because they feel there are no prospects especially for employment
*15:42.080- 15:47.440* :  because of the state of the economy. They feel that their grievances were not really hard and so
*15:47.440- 15:53.080* :  we're hearing from analysts saying that we're sitting on a ticking time bomb and that's why the
*15:53.080- 15:57.700* :  political establishment really needs to hear, listen and respond to the issues.
*15:58.160- 16:04.940* :  And do the police in Kenya have a reputation as being particularly violent when dealing with
*16:04.940- 16:13.220* :  demonstrations? Historically the police have been known to respond to protesters with excessive
*16:13.220- 16:18.340* :  force. They don't really have a very good reputation and that's why they've been subjected to
*16:18.340- 16:24.780* :  countless initiatives to reform the police force in Kenya. Richard Kegoi in Nairobi.
*16:25.840- 16:31.560* :  Expert witnesses have told a hearing into the Ocean Gate sub-disaster what might have caused
*16:31.560- 16:37.180* :  the Titans submersible to break apart. The US Coast Guard inquiries entering its final days.
*16:37.180- 16:42.860* :  Five people were killed last year when the craft suffered a catastrophic implosion on its way
*16:42.860- 16:46.540* :  to see the wreck of the Titanic. Here's our science editor, Rebecca Murrell.
*16:47.060- 16:51.960* :  The evidence presented focused on the submersibles hull, the parts of the craft where the passengers
*16:52.900- 16:57.420* :  were. Much of it was destroyed by the implosion but investigators have been analysing some of the
*16:57.420- 17:02.400* :  remaining pieces that were scattered across the sea floor. The hull was made from layers of carbon
*17:02.400- 17:08.560* :  fiber, a highly unusual material for a sub because it's not reliable under pressure. Images of the
*17:08.560- 17:13.900* :  wreckage show how those layers of carbon fiber had separated, a known problem called delamination.
*17:14.600- 17:19.880* :  And in some places the material had also cracked. It was not confirmed that the hull was the first
*17:19.880- 17:24.620* :  part of the sub to fail, but the details suggest it's now the focus of the investigation.
*17:25.160- 17:30.580* :  The US Coast Guard also heard evidence about a loud bang that passengers heard during a dive in 2022.
*17:31.400- 17:35.160* :  At the time it was suggested this was made by the metal frame around Titan,
*17:35.760- 17:39.300* :  but a new analysis of sensors on the sub suggests that the noise
*17:39.300- 17:44.200* :  signaled some kind of change to the fabric of the hull and the way it was able to respond to
*17:44.200- 17:47.760* :  the pressures of the deep. Our science editor, Rebecca Murrell.
*17:50.400- 17:56.080* :  And still to come on the global news podcast. They are our direct cousins with whom we share
*17:56.080- 18:01.880* :  an ancient relative with chimpanzees about six million years ago, with gorillas about eight
*18:01.880- 18:07.200* :  million years ago. Spain considers giving new rights to protect great tapes.
*18:15.160- 18:19.860* :  Hey I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.
*18:20.080- 18:25.040* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally when they announce they'd be raising
*18:25.040- 18:30.220* :  their prices due to inflation we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*18:30.480- 18:35.500* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*18:45.220- 18:49.980* :  Hey it's Paige from Gagley Squad. Everybody knows about Daphne and they know I just got a cat. I
*18:49.980- 18:56.180* :  would literally die for her. I was so nervous about the litter box portion of getting a cat.
*18:56.180- 19:02.220* :  And honestly I think it was like the number one thing that was keeping me from being a cat owner.
*19:02.820- 19:07.160* :  Litter robot by whisker is the solution to all of your litter box problems.

*19:13.460- 19:18.080* :  a fresh bed of litter and your friends won't think that your house smells like a litter box.
*19:18.780- 19:25.620* :  I feel like Daphne is unique in tone anyways but I actually feel like Daphne is more of a clean
*19:25.620- 19:31.120* :  freak than other cats. I don't know why I feel like that but I feel like she gets especially happy
*19:31.120- 19:37.580* :  when I clean up her area. So the fact that her litter is always rotating. I know that when she's
*19:37.580- 19:43.600* :  in there she feels clean and that means a lot to me. There are over one million happy pets and pet
*19:43.600- 19:48.940* :  parents who have upgraded to litter robot. So what are you waiting for? Right now whiskers offering

*20:14.200- 20:18.880* :  The UN chief Antonio Gutierrez has told a high level meeting at the United Nations that
*20:18.880- 20:25.340* :  rising sea levels threaten to create a tide of misery for millions with intense storm surges,
*20:25.340- 20:31.020* :  coastal erosion and flooding. Part of the problem is that melting in the Arctic creates a vicious
*20:31.020- 20:38.060* :  circle. As the ice vanishes it exposes the darker ocean surface which absorbs more of the sun's
*20:38.060- 20:44.040* :  energy which in turn accelerates warming. But scientists are working on a possible solution,
*20:44.040- 20:49.880* :  pumping seawater onto the ice to make it thicker. I spoke to Andrea Jekolini, head of the
*20:49.880- 20:57.400* :  British firm Real Ice. So this is called the ice thickening and it consists in pumping seawater
*20:57.400- 21:03.280* :  at the beginning of the winter from under the sea ice to the top of the sea ice. So what this does
*21:03.280- 21:10.040* :  it creates an extra layer of ice because the water in contact with the very cold air temperature
*21:10.040- 21:17.540* :  which frees very quickly. In addition to that what we are doing is because there's normally a layer
*21:17.540- 21:23.680* :  of snow on top of the sea ice by freezing that layer of snow we also reduce the insulation
*21:24.260- 21:30.240* :  between the air and the bottom of the ice. So the ice will naturally continue to grow thicker
*21:30.700- 21:35.220* :  through the rest of the winter. So there is an extra gain that we can observe at the end of the
*21:35.440- 21:40.280* :  winter. And how does this work practically? Do you have boats there or do you put pumps on the ice
*21:40.280- 21:46.820* :  itself? You make a hole in the ice and you use a submersible pump to actually draw the water from
*21:46.820- 21:51.580* :  under the ice to the top of the ice. So the water only needs to travel a few centimeters.
*21:52.460- 21:58.880* :  Just pumps which have a very high flow and very little power consumption so we can be very
*21:58.880- 22:04.840* :  efficient. This is how we are testing it now but the idea long term is that we're going to use
*22:04.860- 22:10.500* :  a small underwater vehicle to do that job because obviously the challenge is to scale it
*22:10.620- 22:17.080* :  to the Arctic scale so millions of square kilometers. That will be quite a feat. How's it going so far
*22:17.080- 22:22.900* :  in terms of your results? They've been very promising. We've been in the Arctic twice in February 2023
*22:22.900- 22:30.260* :  in Alaska and in January this year in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada. We realized last time we
*22:30.260- 22:37.080* :  went an area if you want to a foot will pitch for around 25 centimeters on top of the ice by
*22:37.080- 22:43.320* :  just flooding the area with water. So we created roughly to give an idea one thousand tons of
*22:43.320- 22:50.860* :  new ice and this was just a few days of pumping. Then we went back in May to check the final
*22:50.860- 22:56.640* :  measurements and we found that the area we realized was actually 50 centimeters thicker than the
*22:56.900- 23:03.660* :  control area. So there was an extra 25 centimeters extra growth compared to the non-rearized area
*23:04.160- 23:09.360* :  that we gained which was the promising part that we wanted to validate. So it sounds like it's made
*23:09.360- 23:15.720* :  a big difference there. When might this be able to be scaled up across the Arctic? It will take
*23:15.720- 23:21.480* :  a few years. First of all we need to make sure that we can actually go to bigger areas where we can
*23:21.480- 23:27.520* :  observe that the ice at the end of the summer actually lasts a few more weeks or months so it can
*23:27.520- 23:34.040* :  expose its bright surface to the sun and reflect a lot of solar radiation to keep the world cooler if
*23:34.040- 23:40.440* :  you want. So we'll try this winter with a one square kilometer area but then we also need to
*23:40.440- 23:45.580* :  demonstrate that there's no side effects. We need to show that wildlife, environmental, local
*23:45.580- 23:52.540* :  populations are not affected by our work and once that is done we can give it to whoever wants to
*23:52.540- 23:59.220* :  use it as a tool to cool the planet. Andrei Ocecalini had of the firm real ice.
*24:00.480- 24:06.220* :  Children's ice site is steadily getting worse with one in three now short-sighted
*24:06.220- 24:12.280* :  unable to see things in the distance clearly according to a new study. It warns that short-sighted
*24:12.280- 24:18.220* : ness is a growing health concern around the world set to affect millions more children by 2050.
*24:18.680- 24:24.400* :  Victoria Oon Kunda asked Professor Kathy Weiss, a pediatric ice specialist from the University
*24:24.400- 24:32.160* :  of Alabama in the US why this is happening. You know researchers aren't exactly sure. We do know
*24:32.700- 24:39.900* :  that this increase in the number of people and children who are getting more nearsighted precedes
*24:39.960- 24:46.460* :  you know the widespread use of electronic devices and so you know we're not really sure exactly
*24:46.460- 24:52.640* :  why it could be related to not getting outdoors as much. There's certainly a genetic component
*24:52.640- 24:59.020* :  to short-sightedness but it doesn't explain what the environment seems to be doing to the eye.
*24:59.760- 25:06.340* :  So what are the worst affected areas or places? There are several Asian countries where 90%
*25:06.340- 25:13.200* :  of the population has nearsightedness so we're not sure if that is because those heavily populated
*25:13.200- 25:19.420* :  areas tend to have you know people indoors more people in high-rises or if it's you know that
*25:19.420- 25:27.660* :  genetic influence to it. In the US we know that in the early 1970s about 25% of Americans had
*25:28.140- 25:36.320* :  nearsightedness and in around 2000 about 42% had it and so you know almost half we also know that
*25:36.320- 25:45.780* :  good research done in Australia suggests that by 2050 50% of the world population will be nearsighted.
*25:45.780- 25:54.580* :  So it's happening everywhere for the most part you'll see it less in countries where outdoor work
*25:54.580- 26:02.020* :  is primary in Australia actually they have less nearsightedness and more skin cancer because
*26:02.020- 26:07.880* :  they're outdoors more. What could promote healthy eyesight? How could we reverse this issue?
*26:07.880- 26:17.720* :  Because this has tripled between 1990 and 2023 up to 36%. First early detection is going to be
*26:17.720- 26:25.000* :  important. The nearsighted eye is too long so we can't actually reverse nearsightedness yet. We do
*26:25.000- 26:31.000* :  know that much literature suggests that we can slow down this short-sightedness and slow down
*26:31.000- 26:36.700* :  the growth of the eye which is great and that's with interventions like special contact lenses,
*26:36.700- 26:43.960* :  multifocal contact lenses, etropine is often used that's an eye drop to help slow down nearsightedness
*26:43.960- 26:51.060* :  and there are special spectacle lenses that may help as well. We would love to prevent the onset
*26:51.060- 26:55.840* :  or delay the onset of nearsightedness. We're not quite there yet but there is emerging
*26:55.900- 27:02.740* :  research that suggests that we could do that. I think what families can do first is get their
*27:02.740- 27:09.960* :  preschoolers outside get the two and three and four-year-olds outside to get that good outdoor light
*27:09.960- 27:16.060* :  that the eyes seem to like and then you know before school or when they start school you know
*27:16.060- 27:23.080* :  kids should have you know pretty good vision 2020 vision and if you see kids squinting or you know
*27:23.080- 27:28.820* :  holding up things very close to their eyes then that's a suggestion that their eyes may be
*27:28.820- 27:35.160* :  short-sighted so getting a vision screening or a comprehensive eye exam would be really important
*27:35.180- 27:40.860* :  and because the earlier we can identify nearsightedness in a child the better we can treat it.
*27:41.280- 27:47.920* :  Professor Kathy Weiss of the University of Alabama. Spain is considering giving new rights to great
*27:47.920- 27:53.160* :  apes paving the way for them to be protected from harmful commercial and scientific exploitation.
*27:53.180- 27:59.660* :  This group of primates which includes gorillas, orangutans, bonobos and chimpanzees is thought
*27:59.660- 28:05.240* :  to be close enough to us humans to warrant a change in the law. If approved the legislation would be
*28:05.240- 28:10.480* :  a world first going much further than recognising animals merely as sentient beings.
*28:11.140- 28:15.680* :  Julie Forrester is a professor at the University of Sussex here in England specialising in the
*28:15.680- 28:22.300* :  behaviour and brain organisation of human and non-human great apes so how closely related are
*28:22.300- 28:28.660* :  they to us. Incredibly close there's this common misconception sometimes that chimpanzees and gorillas
*28:28.660- 28:34.440* :  are like a version of our ancestral selves but they are incredible species in their own right.
*28:34.440- 28:41.100* :  They are our direct cousins with whom we share an ancient relative with chimpanzees about six
*28:41.100- 28:47.040* :  million years ago with gorillas about eight million years ago so our brains, our behaviours,
*28:47.040- 28:52.700* :  our bodies are all very similar. It's true that our ape cousins don't have human language and they
*28:52.700- 28:56.700* :  can't tell us what we're thinking or they're thinking but this doesn't really make them less
*28:56.700- 29:01.500* :  intelligent and we know that many different animal species have different ways to communicate.
*29:01.500- 29:06.920* :  They use a lot of sign language they lose a lot of body posture and in fact we even know from
*29:06.920- 29:13.100* :  human studies that most of what we're communicating isn't really through our verbal speech it's
*29:13.100- 29:19.300* :  through the way we move our eyes around our bodies our faces and we get more information about
*29:19.300- 29:25.340* :  people's intentions from their body language than we do from their actual words. You know I'm a great
*29:25.340- 29:31.220* :  ape you're a great ape we're all primates and from my perspective we're all people human or
*29:31.220- 29:36.240* :  non-human great apes and I know from my own research and from research of my colleagues
*29:36.880- 29:42.300* :  that great apes share a very similar experience of the world to us not just like how they see and
*29:42.300- 29:49.300* :  hear but also how they feel and how they think so they have joy they laugh they grieve they can
*29:49.300- 29:55.980* :  deceive and in fact they're evolved to be very intelligent in their environments and they could
*29:55.980- 30:00.880* :  be you and me hands down in a test of spatial mapping for example.
*30:01.500- 30:07.600* :  Gilly Forrester. A large, rather ordinary looking warehouse in the German city of Cologne is the
*30:07.600- 30:13.500* :  closest you can get to walking on the moon without leaving earth. The European Space Agency says
*30:13.500- 30:20.020* :  its facility known as Luna is the world's most faithful recreation of the Luna surface and as
*30:20.020- 30:23.440* :  Richard Hamilton reports it's just been officially inaugurated.
*30:30.600- 30:37.640* :  Inside the 9 meter high warehouse encased in black walls and ceilings lies a replica of the
*30:37.640- 30:49.260* :  soil that covers the lunar surface. The 700 square meter terrain is strewn with craters
*30:49.260- 30:56.760* :  lumps and rocks and smothered in a fine pale grey powder. More than 50 years ago astronauts
*30:56.760- 31:02.920* :  on NASA's Apollo missions worried that their spacesuits would not protect them from this fine
*31:02.920- 31:09.780* :  material on the moon which was the result of being repeatedly hit by asteroids. Inside this
*31:09.780- 31:16.960* :  building the simulated dust has been ground from a volcanic rock found in a mountain range near
*31:16.960- 31:24.800* :  Cologne. Matthias Maura is an astronaut with the European Space Agency and has served as an advisor
*31:24.800- 31:32.020* :  for Luna over the past decade. So this facility is worldwide the best facility to prepare missions
*31:32.020- 31:38.180* :  to the moon. We have everything that we need to test and prepare ourselves for the moon. It's a
*31:38.180- 31:44.020* :  facility that not even NASA has or any other international partners. So we believe that in the
*31:44.020- 31:49.880* :  future many people will come to Cologne before flying to the moon. I hope also all the NASA
*31:49.880- 31:55.820* :  astronauts will train here before their mission to the moon. The facility will also soon be home to
*31:55.820- 32:03.020* :  a roving artificial sun and an intricate harness system dangling from the ceiling to allow astronauts
*32:03.020- 32:10.200* :  to experience the bouncy reduced gravity of the moon. Luna's floor will also be frozen to a
*32:10.200- 32:16.700* :  depth of three meters to let astronauts practice drilling in search of water ice. Alexander
*32:16.700- 32:22.900* :  Guest who's another European astronaut says the more we understand about the moon the more we
*32:22.900- 32:28.980* :  understand about the earth. The moon is very special in that it's crucially important for our
*32:28.980- 32:36.080* :  understanding of our own planet earth of ourselves of where we come from. The moon is basically a
*32:36.120- 32:42.840* :  twin of planet earth. We don't know quite how it got into existence probably by a big cosmic collision
*32:43.740- 32:49.740* :  and it contains a lot of rocks that are billions of years old that are similar to the ones on earth
*32:50.020- 32:54.600* :  which we don't find on earth anymore. We cannot study them here. If you go to the moon we can study
*32:54.600- 33:00.220* :  we can read in like a history book. This facility has opened several years later than planned
*33:00.240- 33:06.900* :  delayed by the pandemic and the discovery of protected lizards at the site just as construction
*33:06.900- 33:13.180* :  was about to start. The project is part of a joint venture between the European Space Agency
*33:13.180- 33:20.060* :  and NASA for their upcoming Artemis mission. The Europeans are building the service module for
*33:20.060- 33:25.380* :  the Artemis spacecraft as well as the living quarters for an orbiting space station.
*33:26.040- 33:31.940* :  As the world sets its sights on the moon once again the hope is that this will play a critical
*33:31.940- 33:36.700* :  role in preparing for humanity's return. Richard Hamilton.
*33:39.540- 33:43.360* :  And that is all from us for now but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
