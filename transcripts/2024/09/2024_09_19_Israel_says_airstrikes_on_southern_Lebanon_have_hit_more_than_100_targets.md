*01:25.780- 01:29.920* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Friday the 20th of September,
*01:29.920- 01:31.560* :  these are our main stories.
*01:31.560- 01:37.460* :  Israel says its airstrikes on southern Lebanon have hit more than 100 Hezbollah targets.
*01:38.160- 01:42.980* :  In the US the repercussions of false claims by Donald Trump that immigrants are eating
*01:42.980- 01:50.040* :  pet cats and dogs. The EU sends 11 billion dollars to rebuild the communities in central and
*01:50.040- 01:53.280* :  eastern Europe devastated by the storm Boris.
*01:55.720- 01:57.880* :  Also this podcast, the Iron Maiden Galaxy.

*02:09.900- 02:11.960* :  50 years after it was formed.
*02:15.960- 02:19.920* :  We begin this podcast with the latest on the airstrikes in southern Lebanon.
*02:19.920- 02:24.860* :  After Israel launched some of the heaviest bombing since the October 7th attacks.
*02:24.900- 02:29.820* :  The Israeli military says its war planes struck more than 100 Hezbollah sites,
*02:30.220- 02:32.660* :  including rocket launchers ready to be fired.
*02:32.660- 02:37.760* :  Israeli war planes flew low over Beirut, creating sonic booms.
*02:38.120- 02:42.520* :  As Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, a prescribed terrorist organization,
*02:42.640- 02:45.840* :  condemned this week's exploding devices attacks.
*02:46.620- 02:51.380* :  At least 37 people have been killed and thousands more injured since Tuesday
*02:51.760- 02:56.280* :  by exploding pages and walkie talkies used by members of Hezbollah.
*02:56.340- 03:02.360* :  The Lebanese mission to the UN says a preliminary investigation found the targeted devices were
*03:02.360- 03:08.800* :  professionally booby trapped before arriving in Lebanon and were detonated by sending emails to the
*03:08.800- 03:14.300* :  devices. Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah accused Israel of being behind that operation
*03:14.800- 03:15.920* :  and promised a response.
*03:17.580- 03:21.540* :  There is no doubt that the aggression that took place is a major one, and as I said in my speech,
*03:21.540- 03:26.620* :  it is unprecedented and will be met with tough retribution and just retribution and just
*03:26.840- 03:29.480* :  punishment where they expect it and where they do not.
*03:31.320- 03:36.520* :  Our correspondent Hugo Bachega in Beirut listened to the speech and gave us this analysis.
*03:37.380- 03:40.960* :  I think it was very interesting that he acknowledged that this was a massive
*03:40.960- 03:46.160* :  security blow unprecedented in the history of Hezbollah.
*03:46.480- 03:54.480* :  And as expected, he promised a harsh punishment, but he didn't give any indication
*03:54.920- 03:56.880* :  of how this response is going to be.
*03:56.880- 04:02.660* :  But I think it was also interesting that there was no change in Hezbollah's position.
*04:02.720- 04:08.460* :  Again, the indication is that Hezbollah is not interested in an escalation in this conflict
*04:08.460- 04:15.020* :  with Israel, with seeing that for almost a year, Hezbollah has been attacking positions in
*04:15.020- 04:20.480* :  Northern Israel saying that this is in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Hassan Nasrallah again
*04:20.500- 04:27.100* :  said that this campaign, these attacks are going to continue unless there is a ceasefire in Gaza.
*04:27.100- 04:32.680* :  So this has been the main hope here to de-escalate the stations between Israel and Hezbollah
*04:33.000- 04:37.560* :  and those negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza have been unable to reach a deal.
*04:38.000- 04:44.720* :  Hassan Nasrallah also reflected on those decisions that have been taken by the Israeli authorities
*04:44.720- 04:49.360* :  to add the return of those residents who have been displaced from communities in Northern Israel
*04:49.800- 04:57.220* :  as one of the war goals. He said that these attempts by Israel were not succeed.
*04:57.220- 05:01.600* :  And again, that these attacks by Hezbollah are going to continue.
*05:01.600- 05:06.100* :  So no clear indication of what Hezbollah is going to do. Again, as expected,
*05:06.100- 05:09.700* :  some harsh words against Israel saying that these attacks that happened here
*05:10.080- 05:13.860* :  amounted to a declaration of war. He said it was a massacre.
*05:13.860- 05:19.000* :  And again, reflecting on the suffering of the population here over the last two days.
*05:19.680- 05:25.380* :  Hugo Bachega in Beirut. Well, Israel hasn't admitted it was behind the recent attacks via
*05:25.380- 05:31.100* :  walkie-talkies in Pagers. Israel's defence minister, you have Galant, said battle plans for the
*05:31.100- 05:36.580* :  Israel-Lebanan border area had been approved. I got more from our correspondent, Daniel
*05:36.580- 05:43.160* :  Dismoney, in Jerusalem. The Israeli airstrikes today really continue, frankly, almost daily airstrikes
*05:43.160- 05:46.620* :  that have been taking place for quite a long time. Quite a large number of strikes,
*05:46.620- 05:51.000* :  they perhaps a bit more than normal. And the timing of them was certainly interesting,
*05:51.000- 05:54.220* :  because they were happening at the same time that Hassan's rally was speaking, they started
*05:54.220- 05:59.520* :  just beforehand. And letting that timing may not be a coincidence, it may have been intended
*05:59.520- 06:05.960* :  to send a bit of a message to him and to Hezbollah. But the strikes really were a continuation
*06:06.240- 06:13.520* :  of Israel trying to degrade Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon. It's become a daily
*06:13.520- 06:19.100* :  occurrence, this exchange of fire, Hezbollah firing rockets and drones into northern Israel,
*06:19.100- 06:25.500* :  and Israeli fighter jets flying over and attacking Hezbollah positions. And what about these
*06:25.500- 06:31.100* :  reported Israeli plans to take over southern Lebanon? Israel has sat out, as Hugo was saying,
*06:31.100- 06:36.140* :  a war goal of turning Israeli citizens who've been displaced in the north to their homes,
*06:36.180- 06:42.220* :  and there's around 60,000 Israelis who've been displaced. Until this week, there were three
*06:42.220- 06:48.300* :  kind of core war goals of the war that started last October. And they related to Hamas and to
*06:48.300- 06:53.060* :  Gaza. The Israeli security camera added another one earlier in the week, and that was returning
*06:53.060- 06:59.220* :  the citizens. That was like a formalization of the north, the northern front, as being part of
*06:59.220- 07:05.400* :  this war. And this week, the Israeli Defense Minister has spoken about a new phase of the conflict,
*07:05.960- 07:10.560* :  and the fact that the conflict is kind of moving north. They moved a division of the army north
*07:11.320- 07:16.820* :  to the north, massively increasing the troop numbers there. And so what they've said is what their
*07:16.820- 07:21.560* :  goal is. They haven't said how they're going to achieve it. And at the moment, we are seeing
*07:21.560- 07:27.140* :  a continuation of the air strikes. Obviously, we saw the explosions in Lebanon through the
*07:27.140- 07:31.560* :  walkie talkies and the pages. Israel not accepting responsibilities that are denying
*07:31.560- 07:36.900* :  responsive to that, but widely being blamed for it. And frankly, it's hard to see who else it was.
*07:37.580- 07:42.900* :  And that may be part of the same strategy. But I think whether there's actually a ground
*07:42.900- 07:46.200* :  incursion, we still don't know. And they certainly haven't said they're going to do that yet.
*07:47.000- 07:53.860* :  Daniel Dismona in Jerusalem. Washington continues to urge restraint, believing that a diplomatic
*07:53.860- 07:59.200* :  solution in the Middle East is achievable and urgent. Briefing United Nations Security
*07:59.200- 08:03.720* :  Council members earlier, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process,
*08:03.720- 08:09.760* :  Toru, Wenezland, said both sides needed to avoid any further actions that would further worsen
*08:09.760- 08:15.400* :  the situation. I would like to express my great concern of the growing risk of white scale
*08:15.680- 08:21.980* :  regional escalation. The series of explosions across Lebanon and rocket spies towards Israel in
*08:21.980- 08:29.620* :  recent days adds to the volatility. I call on all sides to refrain from steps that will further
*08:29.620- 08:33.900* :  exacerbate the situation and take immediate steps to the escalation.
*08:34.420- 08:40.420* :  So how precarious a moment is this for the Middle East? I asked our security correspondent, Frank Gardner.
*08:41.300- 08:46.040* :  Well, it's not the most dangerous moment, even though that's what the Saudi ambassador to London,
*08:46.040- 08:53.580* :  I think, has said, because there are constraining factors on both sides here. For his bullet,
*08:54.140- 09:00.120* :  they know that if they hit back too hard at Israel, Israel will hit back even harder, and that will
*09:01.300- 09:06.980* :  severely damage Lebanon's infrastructure, that country is already on its knees economically and
*09:06.980- 09:12.820* :  financially, and the last thing it needs as a full-scale war. So, Hasbola knows that if they
*09:12.820- 09:19.500* :  provoke Israel too much in their retaliation, it's going to be costly for Lebanon for their host
*09:20.660- 09:24.480* :  country. At the same time, they know that they've got to do something, so there wasn't much of a
*09:24.480- 09:29.300* :  clue in Hassan Nasrullah's speech. There's always a lot of fiery angry rhetoric. If anything,
*09:29.300- 09:36.080* :  it was a pep talk for his troops, kind of morale booster for them, but he did say you won't necessarily
*09:36.080- 09:41.420* :  hear about how we're going to retaliate. Maybe that's a hint. Maybe it's an empty threat. Who knows?
*09:41.980- 09:47.400* :  For Israel, the constraining factor here is that although there is a lot of political pressure
*09:47.400- 09:54.900* :  on the government to resolve the situation on the northern border, which is depriving well over 60,000
*09:54.900- 09:58.800* :  Israeli citizens from being able to go back to their homes and farms and businesses,
*09:59.300- 10:05.620* :  and an even greater number on the Lebanese side, they know that if they are going to go into Lebanon
*10:05.620- 10:10.600* :  as they have done in the past in previous wars, they're going to get a bloody nose. Hasbola's
*10:10.600- 10:15.500* :  got a very powerful arsenal, and on top of those constraining factors, you've got diplomats
*10:15.500- 10:20.600* :  like Anthony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, trying to call for calm, but it's not that easy
*10:20.600- 10:26.540* :  for, I mean, I don't think Hasbola or Iran, for that matter, and much mood for for calm, because
*10:26.540- 10:33.860* :  Iran is still smarting at the July 31st assassination of Ismail Haneer, the Hamas political leader,
*10:34.500- 10:40.840* :  in an Iranian guesthouse in Tehran, in the heart of the capital, and that is humiliating and
*10:40.840- 10:45.460* :  embarrassing for Iran, so there will be plenty of people in the security establishment there who
*10:45.460- 10:50.880* :  want vengeance for that. Can any pressure be brought to bear internationally? You mentioned the
*10:50.880- 10:56.160* :  Americans. What about the United Nations Security Council? I'm not expecting that to have a
*10:56.160- 11:01.660* :  great deal of effect, to be honest. The real problem here is that the Gaza conflict seems to be
*11:01.660- 11:06.040* :  intractable, and we know where the problem is there, which is that the Israeli government
*11:06.760- 11:14.380* :  doesn't want to sign something that hands over the control of the southern border of Gaza,
*11:14.380- 11:19.220* :  something called the Philadelphia Corridor, because it doesn't trust anybody, including the UN,
*11:19.880- 11:26.000* :  not to stop Hamas weapons being smuggled back in and launched at Israel's cities and towns.
*11:26.780- 11:31.540* :  So for their part, Hamas say, well, we're not going to sign up to a deal and hand over our
*11:31.900- 11:38.020* :  prize, the Israeli hostages, unless we can be sure that Israel is going to leave Gaza and not come
*11:38.020- 11:43.940* :  back, and Israel's refusing to give that guarantee. And the Americans are clearly getting very frustrated
*11:44.580- 11:51.280* :  with what they see as Netanyahu's entranjitance. Frank Gardner, one of the most memorable moments of
*11:51.280- 11:56.620* :  the US presidential election campaign was during the TV debate this month when Donald Trump claimed
*11:56.620- 12:02.580* :  that immigrants are eating pet animals in the town of Springfield, Ohio. The claim has been denied
*12:02.580- 12:09.760* :  by authorities and ridiculed particularly online. They're eating the dogs, the people that came in,
*12:09.760- 12:18.060* :  they're eating the cats, they're eating the pets. Well, it certainly puts Springfield on the map.
*12:18.060- 12:23.140* :  The small city has experienced an influx of migrants from Haiti in the last few years,
*12:23.600- 12:28.440* :  but with all the recent attention on the town, it's now been forced to shut down schools due to
*12:28.440- 12:34.120* :  bomb threats, has braced itself for right wing rallies and dealt with hate speech online.
*12:34.940- 12:37.760* :  Mike Wendling went to Ohio to see her residents are coping.
*12:39.460- 12:44.740* :  Rumors are swirling here in Springfield, Ohio. There's talk of white vans moving immigrants into
*12:44.740- 12:50.000* :  the town, when really they're moving them to and from their factory jobs. Far-right groups have
*12:50.000- 12:54.560* :  been marching in the streets and there are fears they'll return. Earlier this week, local schools
*12:54.560- 13:00.400* :  were closed by hoax bomb threats. It's legging out time at one of the primary schools here in
*13:00.400- 13:05.960* :  Springfield and there's a discreet but definitely noticeable police presence. The authorities
*13:06.580- 13:11.960* :  have ordered state troopers to be posted outside of all the schools in the district here
*13:12.540- 13:17.460* :  because of the dozens of bomb threats, most of which the governor of Ohio says have come
*13:17.460- 13:24.120* :  from overseas. Parents here are concerned, a little bit wary, but most of all baffled as to what's
*13:24.120- 13:29.120* :  happened to this community over the past week. There's always a concern. There's always going to be
*13:29.120- 13:33.580* :  that concern when you send your children to school with everything that's going on in the world today.
*13:33.740- 13:38.280* :  I think they need to leave the schools out of it. I'm up here getting my grandkids at the same
*13:38.280- 13:43.640* :  school I got my kids from. Everybody's cats are safe, dogs are safe. You go up here at these
*13:43.640- 13:49.800* :  factories, this big factory, going to bathrooms. There's killed the agents on the walls.
*13:51.420- 13:56.940* :  I mean it's bad. Despite the rumors, the one thing that most parents here agree on is that the grand
*13:56.940- 14:02.360* :  daddy rumor of them all, which started all of this off, is absolute bunk. It's been just over a
*14:02.360- 14:07.320* :  week since Donald Trump stood at the podium on a national TV debate stage and said something out
*14:07.540- 14:20.280* :  that had its origins in the dark corners of the internet. This unsubstantiated claim was made
*14:20.280- 14:26.080* :  at a city council meeting in August. It went viral as did a Facebook post recounting a cat eating
*14:26.080- 14:32.220* :  allegation written by a Springfield resident who attributed it to the friend of the daughter of a
*14:32.220- 14:37.080* :  neighbor. She's since taken the claim back, but not before it became entangled in the fractious
*14:37.080- 14:44.080* :  U.S. political race and turned this normally quiet city of 60,000 in southwest Ohio upside down.
*14:44.360- 14:49.040* :  Haitians who have just been mining their business going to work in coming home are now terrified
*14:49.060- 14:55.020* :  to walk on the streets. Laura Kovaleski grew up in Springfield. She and her Haitian mother run a
*14:55.020- 15:00.260* :  translation and advice service for immigrants here and she says life has changed over the past week.
*15:00.440- 15:05.900* :  There's a woman who came with her small son who's probably around four years old and she just
*15:05.920- 15:11.620* :  wanted a one way to get to Brazil because she's terrified of someone killing her son. Her walking
*15:11.620- 15:15.600* :  home, her transit to home, she gets people yelling at her screaming at her and she knows it's
*15:15.600- 15:19.600* :  hateful, but she doesn't understand what they're saying. Local business owners have praised Haitians for
*15:19.600- 15:24.040* :  their hard work. They've revitalized many of the factories here, but the tensions in the community
*15:24.040- 15:28.980* :  are evident. Haitians here have told me of stories of harassment and more serious incidents including
*15:28.980- 15:34.500* :  assaults. But in the face of all the negative attention, there are signs that Springfielders are
*15:38.800- 15:42.440* :  sticking together. At a Haitian restaurant in South Springfield, businessman Jacob Paying takes a
*15:42.440- 15:47.180* :  quick break from ferrying dishes of rice, beans and stew from the kitchen. For the past week and a
*15:47.180- 15:56.000* :  half, 96% of our guests are non-hation. Before we did have a few here and there, you know they wanted
*15:56.000- 16:02.620* :  to try the culture, try the food at a curiosity. Now they've been coming by numbers to support us.
*16:02.620- 16:07.640* :  For now, things here in Springfield may have quieted down. The governor of Ohio says
*16:07.640- 16:12.380* :  bomb threats have tapered off, but Springfield's moment in the spotlight might not be over
*16:12.380- 16:17.320* :  quite yet. Donald Trump has suggested he'll hold a rally here in the near future.
*16:18.880- 16:23.920* :  Mike Wendling. Heavy metal fans around the world have been celebrating our
*16:23.920- 16:29.060* :  maiden's announcement of an international tour to mark the group's 50th anniversary.
*16:29.140- 16:34.780* :  The iconic British band have so far committed to dates across the UK in Europe next year,
*16:35.140- 16:39.040* :  and are thought to be about to reveal more destinations for 2026.
*16:39.760- 16:45.000* :  Michael Han, author of Denomen Leather, The Rise and Fall of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal,
*16:45.180- 16:50.100* :  spoke to us about our maiden's impact on heavy metal music around the world.
*16:51.040- 16:55.940* :  They're in a hugely important group in the history of heavy metal because they proved that you
*16:55.940- 17:02.560* :  could stay true to your roots and be successful. When in the mid 80s, lots of bands were
*17:03.280- 17:08.620* :  turning to make up and to poppy chorus is made and doubled down, and they became bigger than ever
*17:08.620- 17:15.400* :  as a result. Their influence on metal has been profound in the sense of being role models
*17:16.160- 17:23.260* :  for fidelity to metal. They're sound is so distinctive that it's hard to copy them without
*17:23.260- 17:28.740* :  obviously copying them, so you won't get that many bands you sound exactly like Iron Maiden.
*17:29.400- 17:35.680* :  Since the mid 80s, Iron Maiden have been an arena-filling band in Europe and the UK
*17:35.680- 17:41.460* :  and in North America and in South America. They're a band who can fill stadiums around the world.
*17:41.460- 17:47.120* :  They've broken new ground for metal in many ways. They're playing a huge outdoor show in Bangalore
*17:47.780- 17:53.460* :  about 20 years ago that was one of the big moments for metal in India. They're a band who
*17:53.460- 17:58.660* :  take their duty of taking their music all around the world absolutely seriously. If you
*17:58.660- 18:02.840* :  obviously film their shows in South America is berserk. People really love them and they're playing
*18:02.840- 18:09.140* :  the vast, vast, vast crowds, but they've done that by being consistent. They never tried to make
*18:09.140- 18:15.380* :  commercial hair metal. They never put on makeup. They always did what they did, which was these long
*18:15.380- 18:21.260* :  intricately involved songs, often based on progrop, often taken from history, and with certain
*18:21.260- 18:27.680* :  defining elements in the sound, the twin lead guitars and especially the gallop, the Iron Maiden gallop,
*18:27.680- 18:35.340* :  the sound that powers so many of their songs. They're an instantly recognizable band and they
*18:35.340- 18:39.680* :  have been from very long time. They're bands who can still appeal to 14-year-olds because they
*18:39.680- 18:47.880* :  still sound gory and grizzly. The author, Michael Han. Still to come in this podcast?
*18:50.740- 18:57.680* :  I think my brain will permanently be rewired with the image of floating. My body keeps wanting to go
*19:01.080- 19:06.340* :  back. It's music but not as we know it as a violin player returns from space.

*19:48.260- 19:53.160* :  allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes. And then when I asked if raising prices
*19:53.160- 19:57.880* :  technically violates those owners to your contracts, they said, what the **** are you talking

*20:20.060- 20:25.720* :  Flood defences in Poland's third biggest city of Rotswap looked to have held firm for now
*20:26.100- 20:31.340* :  after the worst floods and at least two decades ravaged central Europe this week, killing at
*20:31.340- 20:37.540* :  least 23 people. The floods that have inundated the Polish Czech border since the weekend reached
*20:37.540- 20:42.540* :  the city of more than 600,000 overnight. The president of the European Commission,
*20:42.540- 20:48.300* :  Ursula von der Leyen, traveled to Rotswap on Thursday. She met the prime ministers of Poland,
*20:48.300- 20:53.660* :  Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to discuss the EU support for the country's worst
*20:53.660- 20:59.880* :  affected. This is what she announced after the meeting. These are extraordinary times and
*20:59.880- 21:07.220* :  extraordinary times need extraordinary measures. At first sight, 10 billion euros are possible
*21:08.060- 21:15.540* :  to mobilize from the cohesion funds for the countries that are affected. This is an emergency
*21:15.540- 21:22.700* :  reaction now. Ursula von der Leyen, well Paul Henley, spoke to Seminis and Gupta, the international
*21:22.700- 21:28.260* :  climate reporter for the New York Times, and asked her what conclusions she drew from the announcement
*21:28.260- 21:37.120* :  by Ursula von der Leyen. Two things. One, it's an acknowledgement that even countries in Europe
*21:37.980- 21:48.040* :  are having to urgently adapt to the hazards of extreme weather. And two, I'm struck by
*21:48.040- 21:54.340* :  how much an emergency funding the European Union can mobilize. 10 billion dollars is quite a lot
*21:54.340- 22:00.920* :  of money and it's not the kind of money that many low and middle-income countries have when they
*22:00.920- 22:07.560* :  face similar or far worse climate hazards. What's the best way of spending that money do you think?
*22:09.580- 22:16.340* :  Well, I can certainly tell you about the research that I have seen. There are many ways to adapt
*22:16.420- 22:25.060* :  to what is becoming more frequent and more unpredictable extreme weather events. So for something
*22:25.060- 22:32.660* :  like storms and flooding, there are a few things that are known to work. One is putting in place an
*22:32.660- 22:40.860* :  early warning system that very clearly tells people what the weather projections are and
*22:42.320- 22:48.940* :  advises them on what to do, including how to get to the closest shelters. That, of course, means
*22:48.940- 22:57.140* :  having shelters around. In the long term, slightly harder things to do, things like prevent development
*22:57.140- 23:04.460* :  in flood-prone areas or especially risky areas. But where those areas are already developed,
*23:04.540- 23:09.180* :  you'd have to pay people quite a lot of money to move permanently away from river banks, wouldn't you?
*23:10.460- 23:17.540* :  Well, and that's true, and that may not be necessary in instances like this. So in instances like
*23:17.540- 23:25.560* :  this, it may well be necessary to shore up physical infrastructures to make roads and bridges more
*23:25.560- 23:33.020* :  capable of handling extreme rainfall. But we also know from other examples around the world,
*23:33.020- 23:41.620* :  examples of extreme flooding that the damages and the loss of life is really extreme when people
*23:41.620- 23:47.600* :  are living in particularly risky areas. We've only got a few seconds, but are you clear there is
*23:47.600- 23:54.080* :  a connection between these floods and climate change very briefly? There is no direct connection
*23:54.080- 23:59.840* :  between these floods being attributable to climate change. Those studies simply haven't been done
*23:59.840- 24:06.720* :  yet. However, a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, which means that more extreme rainfall
*24:06.720- 24:13.820* :  events are a hallmark of climate change. So many sangupta, the international climate reporter,
*24:14.300- 24:19.740* :  for the New York Times. A woman who was part of the expedition on board the ship which launched
*24:19.740- 24:26.080* :  the ill-fated Titan mission to visit the Sunken Titanic has given emotional testimony at a hearing
*24:26.080- 24:31.360* :  into what went wrong. Renata Rojas said that after the sub-communication ceased last June,
*24:31.360- 24:36.800* :  she worried where are they. The U.S. Coast Guard inquiry has also released new underwater footage
*24:36.800- 24:41.380* :  of the wreck of the sub. Our science editor Rebecca Morel was watching proceedings.
*24:42.260- 24:48.160* :  Recorded nearly 3,800 meters down at the bottom of the Atlantic, the footage shows the titan
*24:48.160- 24:54.280* :  submersible in pieces on the sea floor. A metal dome can be seen coming apart from a ring of
*24:54.280- 24:59.280* :  titanium, which is attached to the remnants of the hull. This is where the passengers would have
*24:59.280- 25:04.380* :  been. The sub would have been crushed instantaneously by the immense pressure of the deep.
*25:05.060- 25:09.440* :  The footage has been released by the U.S. Coast Guard, which is trying to establish exactly
*25:09.440- 25:14.780* :  what went wrong. There was also evidence from Renata Rojas, who was on board the support ship
*25:14.780- 25:20.920* :  in 2023 when the titan subm went missing with the loss of all five passengers. She was asked
*25:40.520- 25:43.480* :  about how they had seemed before setting off. The year before the disaster on the titan,
*25:43.480- 25:48.600* :  she had herself paid for a place on the sub. She said although things went wrong with that dive,
*25:48.600- 25:54.060* :  there were problems controlling the vessel. She trusted Oceangate's safety protocols. The hearings
*25:54.060- 26:01.720* :  continue. When archaeologists go digging, they're usually looking for lost treasure or statues
*26:01.720- 26:07.120* :  and the remains of buildings from civilisations in the past. But a team of students in northern
*26:07.120- 26:13.000* :  France find a note from a fellow archaeologist who'd been doing their job 200 years ago.
*26:16.500- 26:20.240* :  The team of students, led by a professional archaeologist, is conducting an excavation
*26:20.240- 26:25.720* :  at a site called Caesar's Camp, on cliffs north of Dieppe in Normandy. Though it's called Caesar's
*26:25.720- 26:30.040* :  Camp, it is in fact the site of a fortified Celtic or Gourished village, not decimilar from the
*26:30.040- 26:35.220* :  one in the Asterix books. The dig was ordered because coastal erosion is gradually destroying the
*26:35.220- 26:39.840* :  site, may well or have fallen into the sea in a few years' time. On Monday, one of the teams,
*26:39.840- 26:45.000* :  sifting through the earth, chanced upon a small jar, inside which was a glass flask,
*26:45.360- 26:50.800* :  and inside that was a tiny roll of paper tied with string. When they opened a paper, they found
*26:50.800- 26:56.740* :  it was a message, left behind by a certain PJ Ferre, a local man who the message said,
*26:56.740- 27:03.680* :  in January 1825, was conducting an excavation on this very site. He'd left the note, knowing,
*27:03.680- 27:09.680* :  or hoping that one day researchers would be back. So not quite the discovery the team was expecting
*27:09.680- 27:16.940* :  for the moment of archeological magic, nonetheless. He's scurfield. Now to a story about a South
*27:16.940- 27:23.980* :  American capubara that has catapulted a small family-run zoo in Telford in England into the headlines.
*27:23.980- 27:30.400* :  Cinnamon, the giant rodent, escaped almost a week ago, and though her keepers tracked her down using
*27:30.400- 27:36.740* :  thermal drones, they now say plans to capture her a temporarily on hold, in case they scare the
*27:36.740- 27:42.440* :  animal away. The zoo says the story of cinnamon's escape has captured international attention.
*27:42.700- 27:49.360* :  We've got an update on the capubara from Will Dorrell, partner and zoo owner at Huzoo and Dinosaur
*27:49.360- 27:55.260* :  World. She's spotted two nights in a row each time within about 5-10 meters of her previous location.
*27:55.500- 28:00.900* :  It is woodland that is owned by the zoo, but the thicket that she goes to as soon as we turn up,
*28:00.900- 28:06.220* :  it's pretty much impenetrable, obviously not for a capubara, but for human beings. So it is making
*28:06.220- 28:12.000* :  life a lot more difficult than obviously we anticipated at first. We are hoping that we can obviously
*28:12.000- 28:16.160* :  entice her out of there, but we've just paused things at the moment because what we don't want to do
*28:16.160- 28:21.020* :  is potentially end up forcing her to feel that she's got to move elsewhere and moving off-site and
*28:21.020- 28:24.840* :  somewhere that could potentially be dangerous for her. She seems very, very comfortable. We sort of
*28:24.840- 28:28.420* :  seem to find her sort of den area last night, where it was certainly area that she's spending a lot
*28:28.420- 28:33.580* :  of time. There was a lot of capubara poo around there, a huge amount of food and it's huge water
*28:33.580- 28:37.400* :  sources there. There's several ponds in that in that woodland that we can see evidence that she's
*28:37.400- 28:41.240* :  been to a couple of them. In the wild, if they felt threatened, the person they would do is dash to
*28:41.240- 28:46.420* :  water and go underwater, but she is living her best life at. It's literally a bit of a capubara's
*28:46.460- 28:50.600* :  dream, which is great for her, not so great for us because we can't really offer her something
*28:50.600- 28:56.120* :  that she hasn't already got. They're very, very stocky animals. She's probably the size of a large
*28:56.120- 29:00.720* :  spaniel at the moment, so a large fox might be of a similar size, but they're not going to go
*29:00.720- 29:05.160* :  for a capubara. Unfortunately, it was keeper era. One of our zookeepers when they were entering her
*29:05.160- 29:09.260* :  enclosure to moat, so they were using a tractor with a moor on the back. They had to have the gate
*29:09.260- 29:13.320* :  open for a short period of time as they went in and standard protocol should be that they check the
*29:13.320- 29:18.000* :  area immediately by the gate to make sure there's not a capubara near there and on this occasion,
*29:18.000- 29:25.140* :  they either did and didn't see her or they forgot to check it. Well, Doral, these days it's not that
*29:25.140- 29:30.680* :  unusual to have long distance link-ups between musicians in different countries, but now one
*29:30.680- 29:33.540* :  group has taken the idea into new frontiers.
*29:47.040- 29:53.800* :  That's a recording of Sarah Gillis playing a violin in space alongside musicians back on Earth.
*29:54.400- 30:00.560* :  She returned last weekend after five days in orbit with SpaceX's Polaris Dawn and told Tim
*30:00.560- 30:07.120* :  Franks that taking a violin into space is much trickier than you may think. It was certainly a
*30:07.120- 30:12.600* :  age challenge to get there. On our mission, we were performing a spacewalk and so the entire capsule
*30:12.600- 30:18.000* :  went to vacuum. So there were all sorts of considerations for how we actually safely bring
*30:18.000- 30:23.460* :  an instrument to space. We did have to put it in a vacuum chamber, put it through chemical and
*30:23.460- 30:29.920* :  material testing. I did all sorts of measurements on exactly how much rosin was required to actually
*30:29.920- 30:36.100* :  make sound. I think for me personally, one of my favorite moments was just seeing a wooden violin
*30:36.100- 30:41.700* :  floating in this 21st century spacecraft. I think all of us were pretty emotional the first time
*30:41.700- 30:46.540* :  we unpacked it and pulled it out. Well, I can imagine, and I mean, obviously you're talking about
*30:47.200- 30:52.000* :  something that has been very fundamental to human existence for a very long time. Absolutely.
*30:53.100- 30:57.700* :  Suddenly coming into close contact with something which is right at the very edge of that,
*30:58.040- 31:03.340* :  of our technological experience. And I guess it's worth underlining the fact that you are not just
*31:03.340- 31:09.560* :  a very talented musician. You were also chief engineer on this project. So I guess it meant a lot
*31:09.560- 31:15.860* :  to you. Yeah, I think this whole mission has been very near and dear to my heart. So had the immense
*31:15.860- 31:21.660* :  privilege to contribute to the mission, both as a crew member in the spacecraft, but also on the
*31:21.660- 31:26.900* :  development side, helping us figure out the procedures and go through all of the testing on the
*31:26.900- 31:33.060* :  space suit and the mobility aids and support of the EVA. And the EVA, the extra vehicular activity
*31:33.060- 31:38.420* :  as it's called with you actually popping your head. And well, I guess some of your body out of
*31:38.420- 31:43.900* :  the spacecraft. Yeah. So our biggest mission objective was performing the first commercial
*31:43.900- 31:50.620* :  spacewalk. And this has really been a massive development endeavor by the SpaceX team over the last
*31:50.720- 31:55.660* :  two and a half years. But for this mission, we were in a spacecraft with four people and there's no
*31:55.660- 32:00.800* :  airlock. So what this required was actually venting the entire spacecraft to vacuum with all four
*32:00.800- 32:06.820* :  crew members suited and then opening the hatch to go out and collect data, go through some test
*32:06.820- 32:13.340* :  matrix. And I know Sarah that you've been very clean to emphasize that you were doing some serious
*32:13.340- 32:17.860* :  research up there. You will also be aware that there've been some people who have said, you know,
*32:17.860- 32:24.240* :  this was a mission that happened as a result of a put it crudely, a billionaire, a Jared Isaacman
*32:24.240- 32:31.080* :  who had sort of money to burn on this exploration. What's your answer to that? I think every single one
*32:31.080- 32:37.140* :  of the objectives that was undertaken on this mission has very real application to the future
*32:37.140- 32:43.520* :  of humanity in space. When you think about a future where we want to send hundreds of people to
*32:43.520- 32:49.160* :  space, we want people to be able to live on planet someday. You can't have suits that require
*32:49.160- 32:54.420* :  billions of dollars to build that are so custom for the spacewalk. This is the first time a commercial
*32:54.480- 32:59.800* :  entity has taken on this challenge of actually starting the design cycle to build a suit that could
*32:59.800- 33:05.400* :  someday support hundreds of people living in space communication over Starlink. It fundamentally
*33:05.400- 33:13.540* :  can change how we interact both on Earth as well as with satellites and vehicles on orbit. It is
*33:13.540- 33:20.360* :  an absolute game changer for how you can communicate and what you can actually accomplish. The science
*33:20.360- 33:25.220* :  and research that we performed on this mission was was very intentionally selected. We were able to
*33:25.220- 33:31.820* :  get through almost 40 different research experiments looking at really how do you take people and allow
*33:31.820- 33:36.880* :  them to go into space for longer. Can I just ask how you are and how the violin is? Are you both
*33:36.880- 33:42.320* :  doing okay since your turn? Absolutely. I'm doing so wonderfully. I think my brain will permanently
*33:42.320- 33:50.440* :  be rewired with just the image of floating. My body keeps wanting to go back and just experience
*33:50.440- 33:57.700* :  that true weightlessness again. But the violin is doing great. It survived full exposure to vacuum,
*33:57.700- 34:02.360* :  state intact. It will actually be auctioned off at some point in the future. So watch out for that.
*34:06.620- 34:10.680* :  That's it from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
