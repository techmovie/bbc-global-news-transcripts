*00:52.140- 00:56.740* :  And in today's culture, there's no greater signifier of taste than the car you drive.
*00:56.740- 01:00.300* :  You want something sophisticated, but not stodgy,
*01:00.600- 01:05.400* :  daring yet classic, approachable, but with an air of opulence.
*01:05.560- 01:07.880* :  That's where the Range Rover evoke comes in.
*01:08.020- 01:12.140* :  The reductive exterior is an elegant expression of Range Rover DNA
*01:12.140- 01:18.100* :  and the chiseled taillight graphics give the evoke a sense of motion even at standstill.

*01:26.500- 01:29.660* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:31.740- 01:36.500* :  I'm Janak Jalil and in the early hours of Friday the 6th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:37.160- 01:41.460* :  America's top diplomat visits Haiti in a show of support for a nation struggling to
*01:41.460- 01:47.440* :  free itself from the grip of gangs and corruption. President Biden's son Hunter enters a
*01:47.440- 01:55.000* :  surprise guilty plea in a tax evasion case. Providers of VPNs say they've seen an unprecedented
*01:55.000- 02:01.300* :  surge in demand in Brazil since a social media platform X was banned there last week.
*02:04.640- 02:09.820* :  Also in this podcast, the actress Jillian Anderson talks to the BBC about her new book,
*02:09.820- 02:12.740* :  a collection of women's sexual fantasies.
*02:13.160- 02:16.580* :  And I did include my own fantasy in the book.
*02:16.800- 02:17.940* :  Any clues which one?
*02:23.180- 02:25.880* :  Haiti has been gripped by gang violence for years.
*02:26.460- 02:30.400* :  The situation shows little sign of improvement despite the recent deployment of a
*02:30.400- 02:34.640* :  longer-weighted international force which includes hundreds of police officers from Kenya
*02:35.160- 02:39.840* :  and is funded by the United States. The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken
*02:39.840- 02:44.480* :  traveled to Haiti to try to push forward the process of organizing elections.
*02:45.120- 02:49.380* :  Mr. Blinken said he hoped to see an electoral council established next year.
*03:11.200- 03:15.340* :  So how much of a difference has the US funded international force made in Haiti?
*03:15.860- 03:18.980* :  Our Central America and Caribbean correspondent is Will Grant.
*03:19.460- 03:22.520* :  It's dropped out of the headlines a little bit compared to a few months ago,
*03:22.520- 03:28.500* :  but that's not a suggestion that the humanitarian crisis isn't just as severe as it has been
*03:28.720- 03:31.340* :  you know, over this past year, a couple of few years really.
*03:31.780- 03:36.240* :  I think the difference about what this international force might have made is simply
*03:36.240- 03:39.000* :  sureing up the security situation a little better.
*03:39.520- 03:44.840* :  These 400 or so Kenyan officers supporting the Haitian National Police
*03:45.360- 03:50.020* :  has at least bolstered the police a little bit and brought a period of calm.
*03:50.020- 03:53.780* :  Now critics suggest that that period of calm may have been sort of on its way
*03:53.780- 03:57.480* :  anywhere and they haven't really made any great inroads to taking back territory
*03:57.480- 03:59.540* :  or pacifying the country as a whole.
*04:00.020- 04:05.480* :  Nevertheless, I think Haiti has enjoyed would be the wrong word but maybe experienced a few more
*04:05.480- 04:08.200* :  weeks of calm than it had earlier in the year.
*04:09.080- 04:10.880* :  So tell us about Mr Blinken's visit.
*04:11.080- 04:14.940* :  What is he hoping to achieve from this rare trip to Haiti?
*04:15.800- 04:17.900* :  Well, part of it will be symbolic.
*04:17.900- 04:23.240* :  It is a message being sent out by the Secretary of State that the US supports that international force
*04:23.600- 04:27.640* :  that are there fully in support of the transitional council and the new prime minister.
*04:28.440- 04:32.520* :  Those direct meetings between the two of them they can put issues on the table,
*04:32.520- 04:37.220* :  questions about how the United States might be able to bolster humanitarian aid to the nation.
*04:37.220- 04:42.940* :  But I think also there is an element about seeing the neighbour, the Dominican Republic,
*04:42.940- 04:44.680* :  which will be the second part of his trip.
*04:45.080- 04:48.120* :  Obviously that is a very strained relationship.
*04:48.120- 04:54.280* :  The Dominican Republic has not necessarily welcomed Haitians with open arms indeed has
*04:54.560- 04:58.120* :  deported Haitians back to the country in the midst of a crisis so there will be conversations
*04:58.580- 04:59.520* :  on that front too.
*05:00.480- 05:06.100* :  Will Grant, President Biden's son Hunter has pleaded guilty in his tax evasion case
*05:06.100- 05:11.220* :  appearing to surprise federal prosecutors who are ready to begin his trial in Los Angeles.
*05:11.980- 05:17.560* :  He had previously denied allegations that he intentionally avoided paying $1.4 million in
*05:17.560- 05:24.000* :  income tax to fund a lavish lifestyle. Hunter Biden has already faced one criminal trial this year
*05:24.440- 05:28.080* :  having been convicted of offenses related to the possession of a gun in June.
*05:28.720- 05:32.540* :  I spoke to our correspondent Emma Vardy who was on a busy street in Los Angeles
*05:33.220- 05:38.940* :  and started by asking her why Hunter Biden has made this sudden decision to change his plea.
*05:39.840- 05:44.640* :  It's pretty clear that having gone through a criminal trial earlier this year was
*05:44.900- 05:50.320* :  personally very difficult for him and his family and loved ones and that seems to be the basis
*05:50.320- 05:56.320* :  for him deciding to kind of put an end to this and accept going for a guilty plea.
*05:56.320- 06:01.180* :  He just put out a statement saying when he went to trial previously he didn't realize the
*06:01.180- 06:05.280* :  anguish it would cause his family and he says I will not put them through it again.
*06:06.440- 06:10.660* :  So clearly this is something which he has discussed with people he loves behind the scenes
*06:10.660- 06:17.220* :  as well as his legal team and that has brought him to his decision today. Now previously of
*06:17.220- 06:22.760* :  course when his father Joe Biden was running for a second term this case took on a huge amount
*06:22.760- 06:29.260* :  of political significance too because Joe Biden's opponents were using Hunter Biden's crimes
*06:29.260- 06:35.340* :  and his wrongdoing to try to cast shadow over Joe Biden as well. The stakes are a bit lower
*06:35.340- 06:40.180* :  politically now but of course there's still huge interest in the dealings of the president.
*06:40.180- 06:45.320* :  It's sad the first president's son to have ever been convicted in this way and this would have
*06:45.320- 06:50.220* :  been the second criminal trial that was set to get going and which lots of his public representative
*06:50.220- 06:55.540* :  during the period of which he was addicted to crack cocaine would have been laid there once again
*06:55.540- 07:01.540* :  clearly that was very painful for his family last time around and he's decided to put a
*07:01.540- 07:07.800* :  stop to it now and to plead guilty. And so when will he be it be sentenced and is he likely to face
*07:07.940- 07:12.880* :  a lengthy prison term? Well the judges reminded the court today that he could face prison of
*07:12.880- 07:19.860* :  up to 17 years. We expect though and legal commentators have suggested it could be quite a lot
*07:19.860- 07:24.980* :  less than that particularly also now because of his guilty plea and other mitigation that they
*07:24.980- 07:30.740* :  will put forward in for example things that he has now fully paid his taxes there's no outstanding
*07:30.740- 07:39.120* :  money owing but you know these are serious offenses and up to 17 years is what he could be facing.
*07:39.620- 07:44.800* :  It is also quite rare that somebody faces these tax fraud charges and Hunter Biden's team
*07:45.340- 07:50.480* :  pretty much argued quite often that it was partly that he was so high profile that he was being
*07:50.480- 07:56.260* :  held up in this way. Now his sentence in won't take place now until December so quite a way off
*07:56.760- 08:01.380* :  and the heat again will have come out of things quite a lot by then as well because of course that
*08:01.380- 08:07.820* :  is after the November election that people are very focused on. Emma Vardy, providers of virtual
*08:07.820- 08:13.820* :  private networks or VPNs say they've seen an unprecedented surge in demand in Brazil since the
*08:13.820- 08:19.160* :  social media platform X was banned there last week. A Brazilian Supreme Court judge ordered that
*08:19.160- 08:24.380* :  XB suspended after its owner Elon Musk refused to take down several accounts accused of spreading
*08:24.380- 08:31.460* :  disinformation. Ioni Wells reports from São Paulo. X was banned in Brazil after it was ordered to
*08:31.460- 08:36.740* :  suspend dozens of accounts accused of allegedly spreading disinformation and then failed to meet a
*08:36.740- 08:42.260* :  deadline to name a new legal representative in the country. People using VPNs to access it can
*08:42.260- 08:48.820* :  face fines worth nearly $9,000 US dollars. Despite this VPN companies say demand has surged.
*08:49.220- 08:56.260* :  One firm, Proton VPN, said their platform had seen a 1,840% increase in sign-ups since the
*08:56.260- 09:00.600* :  ban compared to their normal rate. Their general manager said the ban amounted to censorship.
*09:01.180- 09:06.180* :  X's owner Elon Musk has accused the judge of destroying free speech. Ioni Wells.
*09:07.160- 09:11.700* :  The newly appointed French Prime Minister Michelle Barnier has pledged to work for respect and
*09:11.700- 09:18.580* :  unity in what has become a politically divided country. Mr Barnier was unveiled on Thursday as a
*09:18.580- 09:23.940* :  choice of France's president Emmanuel Macron after two months of political deadlock. An election
*09:23.940- 09:29.600* :  in July saw votes divided between left wing, centrist and far-right groupings, but with none gaining
*09:29.600- 09:35.740* :  a majority. The veteran French conservative who was the EU's Brexit negotiator faces the formidable
*09:35.740- 09:41.260* :  task of trying to put together a government that won't be toppled by the left or the far-right.
*09:43.980- 09:50.020* :  I approach this period, this new chapter that is opening with great humility. Perhaps the wisdom
*09:50.020- 09:56.660* :  that comes with grey hair is what is needed for this new chapter, this era, this period to be a
*09:56.660- 09:59.340* :  useful one for the French people and for France.
*10:02.740- 10:06.220* :  Of course, one that in Paris, you scoffield, told us more about Michelle Barnier.
*10:06.980- 10:10.760* :  He's most famous in Britain and maybe around the world as being the man who negotiated Brexit
*10:10.760- 10:17.240* :  for the EU, but in France he does have a long and older profile. He, as he says, is a veteran of
*10:17.240- 10:23.820* :  the centre-right, the augurlest party, not that means much anymore. He's 73 years old now, looks young,
*10:24.840- 10:30.300* :  but joined Parliament. Back way back in the 70s, at one point he was the youngest member of Parliament,
*10:30.300- 10:35.260* :  back then. He served as an minister several times, foreign minister and a jackshare,
*10:35.260- 10:41.280* :  before then going to Europe. Obviously, he's very pro-European, very marked by that experience
*10:41.280- 10:45.900* :  in his pro-European credentials are very, very high. And then, Colmaynating there with the long
*10:45.900- 10:50.960* :  period as negotiated for Brexit. He's got a long, long track record, but what you can't say of him
*10:50.960- 10:56.400* :  at all is that he's some kind of maverick or unconventional figure. He's the most conventional
*10:56.400- 11:00.380* :  figure you can imagine, a very, very much in the establishment figure. And that is, I guess,
*11:00.380- 11:04.880* :  both a strength and a weakness now. I mean, he's certainly got plenty of gravitas and experience,
*11:04.880- 11:11.440* :  but at a time when the voters are supposed to have said, we want no more of the establishment,
*11:11.440- 11:16.560* :  what they've got is a lot more of it with him. So what will his priorities be and
*11:16.560- 11:21.820* :  crucially, will his appointment be enough to end the political instability in France?
*11:22.660- 11:26.480* :  I don't think it'll be enough to end this instability. You've heard there, how the left and
*11:26.480- 11:31.500* :  this alliance, with Jean-Luc Melon, sure, the firebrand or the fire left very much at the head of it.
*11:32.660- 11:37.220* :  You know, they are up in arms. They see that they causes a legitimate. They feel that they won
*11:37.220- 11:41.040* :  the election. They should therefore have the choice. The left should therefore be the first
*11:41.040- 11:46.140* :  to have dibs at the Prime Minister's ship. So you're there out to get him. The question is,
*11:46.520- 11:52.540* :  really, is the populist right also out to get him? I mean, if the two of them, the left and the
*11:52.540- 11:56.980* :  populist right decided they didn't want him, then he would be out without any shadow of it out.
*11:57.680- 12:03.320* :  But for the time being, the populists of Mary and the Pen are kind of holding fire. They're saying,
*12:03.320- 12:09.140* :  we'll see what happens. You know, we'll see what his programme is. If he is tough on immigration,
*12:09.280- 12:16.320* :  if he starts improving public services, then maybe, you know, we can give him a lease of life.
*12:16.660- 12:21.140* :  But, you know, he is very, very much dependent on that equation. And as soon as the
*12:21.140- 12:23.400* :  hard right decides they don't want him, they can vote him out.
*12:24.200- 12:30.000* :  He's Gofield. Let's stay in France for a case that has stunned and horrified the country.
*12:30.600- 12:35.880* :  A man has gone on trial accused of enlisting dozens of strangers to rape his wife after he drugged
*12:35.880- 12:41.380* :  her at their family home near Avignon. The court has been told the abuse went on for more than a
*12:41.380- 12:47.020* :  decade, and that the woman's husband had filmed what happened. On Thursday, the woman who's now
*12:47.020- 12:53.820* :  in her 70s began telling her story in court. She's waived her right to anonymity in order to help
*12:53.820- 12:59.200* :  other women recognise if they're being abused in the same way. And just to warn you, this report by
*12:59.200- 13:03.180* :  France correspondent Andrew Harding contains distressing details.
*13:04.480- 13:10.400* :  One woman's voice shook France to the core. Giselle Pelica walked calmly into a court house
*13:10.780- 13:15.460* :  to confront the 51 men accused of raping her over the course of more than a decade,
*13:15.460- 13:21.320* :  as she lay unconscious in her own bed, drugged by her own husband. On the witness stand,
*13:21.320- 13:27.160* :  the 72-year-old described the moment her happy marriage collapsed when a French policeman showed
*13:27.160- 13:32.800* :  her pictures seized from her husband's laptop, pictures of strangers raping her. This is a
*13:32.800- 13:39.320* :  translation of her testimony. It was hard to recognise myself. Then the officer showed me a second
*13:39.320- 13:46.400* :  photo and a third. I asked him to stop. It was unbearable. I was lifeless in my bed, and a man
*13:46.400- 13:53.260* :  was raping me. My world fell apart. I'm speaking now, not for myself, but for all the women who are
*13:53.260- 13:58.540* :  trived and abused. Her husband Dominique had filmed it all, asking only that the men
*13:58.540- 14:05.240* :  warn their hands and take other steps to avoid waking his wife. Dominique has already confessed
*14:05.240- 14:10.820* :  to all this, but many of the other alleged rapists told French police they either didn't know she
*14:10.820- 14:17.740* :  was unconscious or presumed her husband's consent was somehow enough. After testifying,
*14:17.740- 14:23.400* :  Pelico chose to face the cameras again, masking the devastation she said was inside her.
*14:25.320- 14:30.220* :  I think I've said everything I could. It's not easy. There is a lot of pressure. We're going to have
*14:30.220- 14:36.560* :  to fight to the end. This trial is going to last four months. The campaigners here say the problem
*14:36.560- 14:42.760* :  of drugging and raping is far wider than reported. They hope the courage shown by Giselle Pelico
*14:43.300- 14:49.960* :  will now lead to wider changes in laws and attitudes. That report by Andrew Harding.
*14:50.780- 14:54.740* :  Crowds of Palestinians have been queuing at medical centres in the south of the
*14:54.740- 14:59.960* :  embattled Gaza Strip for their children to be vaccinated against polio in a second stage of a
*14:59.960- 15:07.380* :  campaign that has so far seen more than 180,000 youngsters inoculated. Gaza's health ministry reported
*15:07.380- 15:14.640* :  the first case of polio in 25 years last month in a baby. As a devastating Israel Hamas war has
*15:14.640- 15:20.360* :  left many families living out in the open without basic facilities and exposed to sewage and disease.
*15:21.260- 15:24.160* :  These parents said they were terrified for their children.
*15:25.900- 15:32.700* :  There is a lack of hygiene. Food and water are not clean. This vaccination is important for them
*15:32.940- 15:38.300* :  to protect them from diseases that might spread due to malnutrition and poor sanitation.
*15:41.120- 15:46.100* :  I fear the new diseases that have surfaced due to the type of life we currently live
*15:46.780- 15:53.120* :  moving from a tent to a tent. We hope that this vaccine protects them from any complications.
*15:54.520- 15:58.480* :  I asked our Middle East regional editor, Mike Thompson, who's monitoring the situation in
*15:58.480- 16:02.200* :  Gaza from Jerusalem, how the vaccination process is going.
*16:03.200- 16:07.920* :  It's proceeding very well. According to the UN, they say they have managed to vaccinate.
*16:07.920- 16:13.940* :  As you said, there are 189,000 children, so that's fine, but it's very challenging because
*16:14.740- 16:20.380* :  here you have a place that's been devastated by this ongoing conflict. Apparently two thirds
*16:20.380- 16:26.580* :  of the roads have damaged half the hospitals are out of action. You've got so many displaced people
*16:26.580- 16:32.320* :  and, in fact, most of the population of Gaza is displaced. Some of the children that they'll be
*16:32.320- 16:38.040* :  looking to vaccinate aren't actually in these poor seat fires, so they won't be able to reach
*16:38.040- 16:43.240* :  some of them, but aside from that, they're somehow managing to make quite good progress.
*16:43.680- 16:46.800* :  And how will this continue? How long will these seat fires last for?
*16:47.080- 16:53.340* :  Well, each zone has three days and a possible extra day that Israel's agreed to if they
*16:53.340- 16:57.320* :  haven't managed to catch the children they need. And already in the last zone, in the central
*16:57.320- 17:03.560* :  area of Gaza, an extra day had to be added. So after the south, everything moves on then to the
*17:03.560- 17:09.560* :  north, and they're hoping in the end to be able to reach 640,000 children in Gaza.
*17:10.040- 17:15.220* :  And they do need to get about 95% of the children there to effectively vaccinate them.
*17:15.400- 17:20.500* :  The only thing that I've seen that seems a bit worrying is the UN saying that a second dose
*17:21.120- 17:27.620* :  would be needed in late September, partly because I haven't heard so far that pauses have
*17:27.620- 17:33.420* :  been allowed for that. Unless, of course, it's the case that there is a local place that could
*17:33.420- 17:38.900* :  store the vaccines, although that's hard to imagine in a place that's so rexed by conflict.
*17:39.720- 17:43.540* :  Mike Thompson, saying on the topic of urgently needed vaccines,
*17:43.620- 17:47.340* :  three weeks after the World Health Organization declared the latest
*17:47.340- 17:53.960* :  MPOX outbreak, a global emergency, the country at its epicenter, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*17:53.960- 18:01.060* :  has finally received its first vaccines. Nearly 100,000 doses of an MPOX vaccine were delivered to
*18:01.060- 18:05.320* :  the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, with a similar number expected in the next few days.
*18:06.000- 18:11.440* :  Since the start of the year, this vast country has recorded more than 650 deaths.
*18:11.840- 18:17.240* :  The vaccines donated by the European Union still have to be transported to eastern Congo,
*18:17.840- 18:22.520* :  in a country which has poor roads and lacks even basic health care in many places.
*18:23.340- 18:28.720* :  This message from an MPOX patient in Congo was sent to the BBC by the charity MSF or
*18:28.720- 18:37.340* :  Doctors Without Borders. My name is Madua. I knew I was infected when things started appearing
*18:37.340- 18:43.540* :  on my body. I started taking treatment earlier in vain before being brought here.
*18:44.080- 18:50.560* :  I don't recall encountering anybody. I ate meat, but I don't know if I got it from there.
*18:50.560- 18:55.660* :  I was wondering with it, since treatment in hospitals was not helping me much,
*18:56.380- 19:02.440* :  until the wife of my uncle brought me here. She told me to see specialists who arrived to treat it.
*19:02.920- 19:08.500* :  I spent three months and a week with the grace of God, I followed treatment and got healed
*19:08.740- 19:13.080* :  by the grace of God. Our Africa Health correspondent,
*19:13.080- 19:17.420* :  Docus Van Geera, told me more about the vaccination process in the DRC.
*19:18.320- 19:24.120* :  We've seen 99,000 doses there about arrive. We're expecting more on Saturday.
*19:24.880- 19:30.600* :  So this is very important, because vaccines do play an important role in any outbreak, not just
*19:30.700- 19:35.420* :  MPOX. Is this enough though? Some say that this is just a drop in the ocean,
*19:35.420- 19:41.700* :  because DRC initially needs at least three million doses. Africa's disease says the
*19:41.700- 19:49.100* :  continent needs 10 million. So what can 200,000 doses do? And this particular vaccine requires
*19:49.100- 19:56.300* :  two doses administered within a space of four weeks. So 200,000 doses may just probably go
*19:56.300- 20:03.320* :  to 100,000 people, but it's still worth a shot for a disease that is affecting many people,
*20:03.320- 20:08.500* :  particularly in this country. But these vaccines have arrived in Kinshasa. They still got to be
*20:08.500- 20:14.060* :  transported thousands of kilometers to get to the people that need them the most. Why is this
*20:14.060- 20:19.380* :  taking so long? Given the fact that the World Health Organization declared the latest MPOX
*20:19.380- 20:26.440* :  outbreak, a global emergency three weeks ago. So why has it taken so long? WHO says that it would
*20:26.440- 20:30.840* :  not take shortcuts. There's a process that has to be forward in terms of getting an emergency
*20:30.840- 20:37.760* :  use license. However, because of the situation in DRC, even without that license, Gavi,
*20:37.760- 20:43.060* :  the vaccine alliance could procure the vaccines and have them delivered. On your question of why
*20:43.060- 20:49.620* :  would it take so long in country? When you look at the DRC, it is a huge country. The most affected
*20:49.620- 20:56.180* :  areas are also forested areas, hard to reach, hard to access. And we have conflict in East and
*20:56.180- 21:01.840* :  DRC particularly. So there has to be safety considerations, cold chain considerations.
*21:02.220- 21:08.200* :  This vaccine needs to be stored at a particular temperature. How do you move it around within
*21:08.200- 21:13.480* :  that cold chain? Will they use helicopters? Will they use motorbikes? Will they use vehicles?
*21:13.500- 21:18.640* :  All these logistics need to be considered. And there's also another question. These vaccines
*21:18.700- 21:25.960* :  stand are only intended for adults. Yet most of the deaths from MPOX this year have been children,
*21:25.960- 21:33.820* :  I think, four out of every five. Yes, and that is a concern that the partners WHO, UNICEF, Gavi,
*21:33.820- 21:40.840* :  and DRC's government is considering. There's also another vaccine manufactured by Japan's KM
*21:40.840- 21:46.560* :  biologics. And it has been recommended in children who are much younger. But then we still do not
*21:46.560- 21:52.360* :  know when they'll be available in country and whether they will be administered to children so
*21:52.360- 21:59.980* :  soon because there's no data on how it would work in the context in DRC. Africa Health Correspondent
*21:59.980- 22:09.040* :  Tokus Wangira. Still to come? We've known for some time that noise produces stress and stress
*22:09.040- 22:15.960* :  produces cardiovascular heart disease. Now new research has drawn a link between noise
*22:16.320- 22:17.520* :  and infertility.

*24:05.100- 24:11.260* :  Andreas Carlson, whose responsibility for transport? A country like Sweden with vast
*24:11.260- 24:17.100* :  distances and managed partially populated areas. Aviation plays a crucial role in domestic travel.
*24:17.540- 24:22.300* :  It enables connections between loved ones across the country and serves as an important
*24:22.300- 24:26.100* :  driver of Sweden's economy. And despite aviation's importance,
*24:26.100- 24:31.400* :  role in the transport system, it has unfortunately been deprioritized for many years.
*24:31.620- 24:36.840* :  So does that mean people aren't traveling within Sweden to go and see family and all of that
*24:36.840- 24:40.360* :  kind of thing as a result of these taxes? It's only been in place for six years.
*24:40.900- 24:47.920* :  Yeah, and we see now that the Swedish aviation industry is in a difficult situation. We have
*24:47.920- 24:55.060* :  problems with the domestic routes and we need to see how we can strengthen the competitiveness
*24:55.060- 25:00.260* :  in the aviation sector. The aviation tax, which was constructed by the former government,
*25:00.260- 25:07.620* :  hits planes with sustainable fuel in the tanks just as hard as those without. That means
*25:07.620- 25:13.340* :  the aviation tax doesn't have any incentives for more climate friendly solutions at all.
*25:14.400- 25:19.380* :  Sweden's infrastructure minister Andreas Carlson, saying with matters aeronautical,
*25:19.380- 25:24.720* :  now are you sitting comfortably? If you are, then you may be listening to a downloaded version of
*25:24.720- 25:29.420* :  this podcast while you are in aeroplane. Plane seats may not always be comfortable,
*25:29.420- 25:35.840* :  but it seems many of them are made with great care and ingenuity. Some can cost tens of
*25:35.840- 25:39.460* :  thousands of dollars each, especially if you're lucky enough to be a first class,
*25:40.060- 25:44.580* :  where they come fitted with the very latest entertainment systems, luxury upholstery,
*25:44.960- 25:50.600* :  and of course loads of legroom. Roger Hearing has been speaking to our reporter, Chris Baranyuk,
*25:50.640- 25:56.020* :  who's been visiting factories in Northern Ireland, where nearly a third of the world's aircraft seats
*25:56.020- 26:02.180* :  are made. These seats are designed to go into a pretty compact space, but still offer a huge
*26:02.180- 26:06.720* :  range of functionality. You think of it like a big bit of technology packed with different
*26:06.720- 26:12.200* :  capabilities. I mean, you've got the reclining seat itself that can recline fully into a two meter
*26:12.520- 26:18.320* :  flat bed. You've got storage and storage for anything you might bring on the plane right there
*26:18.320- 26:23.700* :  in your seat. You've got entertainment systems. In some of these seats, they come with a 32-inch
*26:23.700- 26:30.180* :  TV screen. They even have cooling systems to keep all of the electronics from overheating,
*26:30.620- 26:37.300* :  so it's packing all of that into a repeatable compact space that makes them so precise and
*26:37.300- 26:41.660* :  difficult to do. Yeah, and I guess you do sit on them, bounce up and down on them. I don't know,
*26:41.660- 26:45.840* :  do they're comfortable? I didn't get the chance to bounce up and down on them. I think they may
*26:45.840- 26:50.100* :  have taken a picture of that, but I did get the chance to lie down in one briefly, and yet very
*26:50.100- 26:54.460* :  comfortable, I have to say. I think really you'd have to lie there for about seven hours to
*26:54.940- 27:00.880* :  really test them, but they do have robots at this production line where the robots are
*27:00.880- 27:04.560* :  interacting with the seats. They're moving tray tables in a night, thousands and thousands of
*27:04.560- 27:10.080* :  times to see if they'll hold up to constant use or repeated use over their lifetimes.
*27:10.400- 27:15.340* :  And I guess, I mean, you're testing the luxury end of the market there, I guess, but they're
*27:15.340- 27:20.420* :  also economy seats. Do the companies make those, I guess, they're different? These companies in
*27:20.420- 27:23.660* :  Northern Ireland, I mean, there's three that tend to get mentioned, in particular, there's Thompson
*27:23.660- 27:29.560* :  Arrow, Collins Aerospace, and there's also Alice Blue Arrow, and these companies tend to specialise
*27:29.720- 27:33.640* :  in business class and first class seats. That's what they really want to do is specialise that
*27:33.640- 27:38.040* :  high-end part of the market. There are other companies trying the world to make a lot of economy
*27:38.040- 27:45.140* :  seats. Saffron is a good example there in France, but the precision engineering is very
*27:45.140- 27:51.420* :  highly desired by airlines, by aircraft manufacturers, for this clean and part of the aircraft.
*27:51.420- 27:56.820* :  They want to be able to choose from a big range of seats that come with the latest technology,
*27:57.160- 28:02.940* :  fine leather, fine fabrics. They want to set themselves apart. This is what Thompson Arrow told me,
*28:02.940- 28:06.460* :  they like to appeal to, and that's what they really specialise in.
*28:06.800- 28:11.380* :  It's been strange in a way, I suppose, that Northern Ireland will be getting such a big slice
*28:11.380- 28:16.200* :  of the market in this. Do they have particular skills there? Yes, it's been surprising at first
*28:16.280- 28:21.200* :  to hear that just under a third of the world's airline seats are made in Northern Ireland,
*28:21.200- 28:26.000* :  but it does make sense when you think about it. Northern Ireland has a long history
*28:26.440- 28:31.520* :  of manufacturing. People may be familiar with Harlem and Wolf. The shipguard is one of the
*28:31.980- 28:36.580* :  biggest shipguards in the world, and more recently, consider companies like Right Bus.
*28:37.060- 28:41.460* :  They've made the new root master buses that were introduced in London some years ago,
*28:41.980- 28:46.820* :  and Northern Ireland also makes and exports a lot of machinery that's used in agriculture and
*28:46.820- 28:54.220* :  construction. There is a bit of a pedigree in manufacturing in Northern Ireland, and the companies
*28:54.220- 28:59.620* :  that work in these sorts of areas are actually desperate for more and more staff. There's lots of
*29:00.320- 29:04.900* :  evidence that they would like to hire more people. Thompson Arrow is one of the companies that
*29:04.900- 29:11.060* :  really wants to expand right now. Chris Baranuch in Northern Ireland. New research has drawn a link
*29:11.060- 29:16.420* :  between noise and infertility. It's a Danish study published in the British Medical Journal,
*29:16.980- 29:22.700* :  and it seems to affect all the women, not younger ones. One headline is that noisy neighbourhoods
*29:22.740- 29:29.860* :  could be linked to nearly 15% increased risk of infertility in women over the age of 35.
*29:30.560- 29:35.840* :  It seems to have a small effect on older men as well. At the same time, the study found a link
*29:35.840- 29:42.760* :  between air quality and male fertility. Evan Davis spoke to Jill Bell, a professor of
*29:42.760- 29:49.280* :  vascular medicine at the University of Dundee in Scotland. I think it's a really interesting study,
*29:49.540- 29:54.740* :  not least because it's drawing people's attention to the dangers of noise. We've known for some time
*29:54.740- 30:02.520* :  that noise produces stress and stress produces cardiovascular heart disease. And I think what's
*30:02.560- 30:08.640* :  interesting here is that we're seeing this same stress affecting fertility. And there's one in
*30:08.640- 30:13.860* :  seven people globally suffer from infertility. It really is a very important study.
*30:14.300- 30:19.520* :  Right, so the route would be stress. Now we also have this finding. This is basically work in
*30:19.520- 30:25.740* :  Denmark on a very, very large sample of people. And so you're looking at kind of broad patterns in
*30:26.260- 30:32.900* :  the data. The air pollution effect on men rather than women. What could be going on there?
*30:33.980- 30:41.220* :  Yes, again, another interesting result. We do know, for example, that women's eggs are there
*30:41.220- 30:48.220* :  right at the beginning when you're born. They're there ready to go. Men in contrast, they make their
*30:48.280- 30:54.680* :  sperm every three months. And of course, dividing cells are much more susceptible to toxins like air
*30:54.680- 31:00.700* :  pollution. So that's possibly one reason. Another reason could be, and this is particularly for the
*31:00.700- 31:05.120* :  nitric oxide gases, which weren't studied, but which have been shown before to be linked to male
*31:05.120- 31:11.400* :  infertility, nitric oxide gases from cars actually absorb through the skin. And I think we all
*31:11.400- 31:19.160* :  know that where you store your sperm is actually just hanging out there and is much more in the open
*31:19.160- 31:24.240* :  air as opposed to the ovaries, which are tucked nicely in your body. So there are some reasons for
*31:24.620- 31:28.740* :  Well, look, going back to noise pollution, have we not been thinking about this enough? I mean,
*31:28.740- 31:33.480* :  I was obviously very surprised to hear this conclusion. Is this something we should be thinking
*31:33.480- 31:41.060* :  about more than? Yes, in the UK, we only have legislation about noise between the hours of 10 pm
*31:41.060- 31:46.560* :  and 7 am. So actually, there's no guidance at all in the number of decibels you can have during
*31:46.560- 31:51.800* :  the day. And we do, when a house is being built, somebody will come along and look at the traffic
*31:51.800- 31:56.800* :  and say, oh, yes, you need double glazing here or you don't. But the difficulty is that this study
*31:56.800- 32:02.140* :  actually showed an effect at quite low levels of sound. And so I think this is going to affect
*32:02.140- 32:08.840* :  town planning. It's going to affect insulation in houses and really needs to be looked at very
*32:08.840- 32:14.580* :  thoroughly, because we're probably going to need new legislation and due course. If this study
*32:14.580- 32:19.440* :  is validated, the advice from the chief scientific officer at care fertility was that people trying
*32:19.440- 32:25.580* :  to conceive shouldn't be unduly concerned by the research. I mean, just any words of advice
*32:25.580- 32:31.100* :  to people in that position? Yes, I mean, in fairness, we know, for example, that drinking a lot of
*32:31.100- 32:37.300* :  alcohol, being overweight, being underweight, or contribute to infertility. But you can't get
*32:37.300- 32:43.780* :  away from the study in the fact that you mentioned yourself. But 14% of these women were actually
*32:43.780- 32:49.560* :  affected by noise. And if you're sitting out there and you are struggling to have a baby,
*32:49.560- 32:54.340* :  you might be thinking, oh gosh, could be the main road running past? And I think this does deserve
*32:54.340- 33:00.840* :  more work. And then we need to take action if it's validated. Professor of Vascular Medicine at
*33:00.840- 33:06.980* :  the University of Dundee, Jill Belch. Just over 50 years ago, a journalist called Nancy Friday
*33:06.980- 33:12.960* :  wrote a book, My Secret Garden, All About Women's Sexual Fantasies. It was a bestseller and
*33:12.960- 33:20.380* :  revelation. That was 1973. Now the actress, Jillian Anderson, one of whose many roles includes playing
*33:20.380- 33:26.980* :  a sex therapist in the TV series Sex Education, has compiled her own collection of women's fantasies
*33:26.980- 33:33.980* :  called Want, which were emailed to her anonymously by women from all over the world. Our culture editor,
*33:34.380- 33:41.120* :  Katie Razzle, has been talking to her. I don't want to have sex.
*33:43.300- 33:46.160* :  Okay. Do you want to have a seat?
*33:48.500- 33:53.600* :  After playing Jean Milburn, giving advice to teenagers in the Netflix series Sex Education,
*33:54.200- 33:58.020* :  Jillian Anderson invited women to tell her their sexual fantasies.
*34:02.820- 34:07.800* :  Now, 50 odd years after Nancy Friday did something similar in My Secret Garden,
*34:07.800- 34:11.200* :  she has compiled an anthology of the letters they wrote.
*34:11.540- 34:17.200* :  I find it hard to read them and not think, who are they? What's going on in their lives?
*34:18.480- 34:24.320* :  I mean, ultimately, this is not my book. This is the book of every woman who contributed.
*34:24.900- 34:29.980* :  And there is still, for many people, a shame or a taboo about talking about sex and talking
*34:29.980- 34:36.500* :  about your sexual fantasies. Yeah, I mean, even though we have, you know, shows like Sex Education
*34:36.500- 34:44.280* :  and Euphoria and 50 Shades of Grey and the multi-billion dollar porn industry, it's in our faces
*34:44.280- 34:53.080* :  on our screens and our phones all the time. And yet, talking about what goes on inside our minds
*34:53.340- 34:54.860* :  makes people really uncomfortable.
*35:00.960- 35:06.960* :  It's 30 years since Jillian Anderson first made her mark as Dana Scully in the TV show The X Files.
*35:06.960- 35:12.900* :  She's played powerful and interesting women ever since, including Detective Superintendent Stella
*35:12.900- 35:19.400* :  Gibson in the Fall and Miss Havisham in Great Expectations. Do you not think as I do?
*35:20.880- 35:26.200* :  Stella is beautiful. Many of the fantasies are from older women. They have insight,
*35:26.200- 35:30.760* :  they appreciate their emotional maturity. So the aging process, I'm glad to hear it as I'm
*35:30.760- 35:35.080* :  very much aging, does have its benefits. But I know it's also quite brutal and that's an actor
*35:35.080- 35:40.660* :  in the public eye. I wonder how you approach aging? I've certainly gone through periods where it
*35:40.660- 35:49.540* :  struck me quite harshly that I too am aging and almost feel like one needs to go through a
*35:49.540- 35:55.380* :  morning of, you know, morning youth at various stages. How's the morning going?
*35:55.380- 36:01.960* :  Oh, just really deep feelings. You know, it's very moving and slightly melancholic.
*36:02.340- 36:05.820* :  You seem fairly comfortable about sexuality and sex. Is that right? Is that fair?
*36:05.920- 36:12.240* :  Yeah, I am, I'm very comfortable with it and I did include my own fantasy in the book.
*36:12.480- 36:13.620* :  Any clues which one?
*36:24.260- 36:28.840* :  That was the actress, Jillian Anderson, talking to the BBC's culture editor, Katie Razor.
