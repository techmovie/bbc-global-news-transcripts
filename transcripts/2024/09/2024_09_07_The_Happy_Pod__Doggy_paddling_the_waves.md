*01:31.460- 01:33.900* :  This is the happy part from the BBC World Service.
*01:39.060- 01:43.780* :  I'm Nick Miles and in this edition. I've met some of the greatest people that would have never
*01:43.780- 01:49.840* :  been in my life without this crazy little sport we're doing. The dogs catching waves with their
*01:49.840- 01:55.100* :  humans. There were two little boys, no older than six or seven years, study the side of the road
*01:55.300- 01:59.780* :  and they saluted the team when they went through and it'll start to stick with me forever.
*02:00.420- 02:05.960* :  The British rescue teams revisiting Morocco a year on from the devastating earthquake
*02:06.400- 02:09.000* :  and could we soon have healthy chocolate?
*02:15.360- 02:20.060* :  Over the past couple of weeks we've been treated to an array of sports through the Olympic
*02:20.060- 02:25.800* :  and Paralympic games but here's one you might not have heard of before, dog surfing.
*02:26.440- 02:31.380* :  The world dog surfing championships happened earlier this year in California and attracted a
*02:31.380- 02:37.880* :  crowd of thousands. Two people that took part were James Wall and his dog Faith and David Fassoli
*02:37.880- 02:43.920* :  with his dog ESA. The happy boards Holly Gibbs spoke to them and started by asking them how they
*02:43.920- 02:49.240* :  got into the sport. You guys can't see me but I actually have one hand and I was doing some inner
*02:49.240- 02:55.620* :  piecework in the cruise California and I was just a puppy at the time and she learned the waves
*02:55.620- 03:01.720* :  and then we got on the pool and then I had a board and it just became one with us.
*03:01.960- 03:07.320* :  And how about you James? I lost my previous dog at Cocker Spaniel and then I got a new dog
*03:07.320- 03:12.280* :  and with that dog I always said hey I'm going to do better with this dog than I did the last.
*03:12.280- 03:17.700* :  So I saw on TV dog surfing and thought all right that sounds like a crazy idea but let's do it.
*03:17.820- 03:23.120* :  So we started out with Raven and she didn't do too well but then I had adopted Faith.
*03:23.120- 03:28.060* :  I found her in a parking garage and decided to give her a better life and then decided that
*03:28.060- 03:33.980* :  hey let's give Faith a try see if she enjoys this surfing thing and basically ever since then we've
*03:33.980- 03:38.920* :  been hooked and it's just awesome because she was a rescue dog that was fearful of the world
*03:39.040- 03:45.900* :  and dog surfing got her more open friendly and trusting with everything and it built a bigger bond
*03:45.900- 03:51.280* :  with her and I and we haven't looked back since. And how do you actually get the dogs on a surf board?
*03:51.480- 03:57.180* :  My family we have two Labadors who absolutely love the water but I don't think I'd get them on
*03:57.180- 04:03.220* :  a surf board. Well one of the things that it's going to sound fine is the dogs need to enjoy the water
*04:03.220- 04:08.640* :  if they love it that was my problem with Raven. She was a Dutch Shepherd Belgian Malinois mix.
*04:08.640- 04:15.240* :  She loved the water. She any water that was near she was in it. That was kind of a problem because
*04:15.240- 04:20.320* :  it was counterproductive is she wanted in the water. Versus Faith she tolerates the water she
*04:20.320- 04:25.540* :  likes the water but she has it in her head that if I'm on this board I'm not forced to swim and
*04:25.540- 04:31.300* :  besides that you got to do some groundwork at home teach him the surfboards a friend feed the dog
*04:31.300- 04:35.680* :  on the board make that board their best friend if they gain two or three pounds because they learn
*04:35.680- 04:40.800* :  to love that board that's not a problem. And David what did the dogs get out of it? I assume they
*04:40.800- 04:46.720* :  enjoy it. Once again my dog has this like little obsessive gene and in her head this little
*04:46.920- 04:54.040* :  obsession with water fetching. So for her she gets to be with me she gets to be in the water she
*04:54.040- 04:59.840* :  gets to be on a board she gets to be in sand she gets to be at the pool she gets to be at the lake
*05:00.020- 05:06.260* :  and all that combined I enjoy that same thing myself so I think the lining what we both love to do
*05:06.260- 05:11.520* :  makes it successful for us. Well that leads me onto my next question. What do you both get out of it?
*05:11.520- 05:17.000* :  James let's start with you. How much do you enjoy it? For me personally as funny as it's going to
*05:17.000- 05:22.460* :  sound is I actually hate the beach. I had never dreamed of that this is going to be something I'm
*05:22.460- 05:27.880* :  going out there doing going to the beach. But yet my dog loves going and they created a huge bond
*05:27.880- 05:32.780* :  between faith and I and then I've met some of the greatest people that would have never been in my
*05:32.780- 05:38.200* :  life without this crazy little sport we're doing. The other thing I've learned is other people
*05:38.200- 05:43.700* :  are seeing what we're doing and the fun I'm having with my dog and it makes them happy. So I've
*05:43.700- 05:49.700* :  gotten we started a social media page to save photos and share with friends and random strangers
*05:49.700- 05:56.140* :  have emailed me message me and they're saying I had such a horrible day I went online I found a
*05:56.140- 06:01.720* :  picture of your dog wearing sunglasses riding a surfboard or just enjoying life and that that brought
*06:01.720- 06:07.900* :  me up. I'm sharing the love of my dog with everyone else. And finally in one sentence could you
*06:07.900- 06:13.580* :  both sum up the feeling of being in the water with your dogs? Just joy. I was going to say joyful
*06:13.580- 06:17.680* :  is going to be my word. That was the first thing that came to my mind was joyful and joyful.
*06:19.060- 06:25.020* :  Faith is my best friend. She goes with me pretty much everywhere. I have gotten to meet wonderful
*06:25.020- 06:30.740* :  people, wonderful dogs through this little French bulldog named Isa. James Wall and David
*06:30.740- 06:37.360* :  for Sully speaking to Holly Gibbs. On the 8th of September last year a devastating earthquake struck
*06:37.360- 06:44.100* :  Morocco killing around 3,000 people. The local people there looked after the search and rescue
*06:44.100- 06:49.240* :  teams and one British team was so moved by the hospitality they've gone back to visit.
*06:49.940- 06:53.980* :  Richard Hamilton has been speaking to some of those who took part in the rescue efforts
*06:54.420- 06:56.560* :  and he starts by looking back on the day it happened.
*06:59.780- 07:04.600* :  Rescue teams in Morocco are battling to reach people still trapped in the rubble following
*07:04.600- 07:12.860* :  Friday's earthquake. The 6.9 magnitude earthquake was the strongest ever recorded in Morocco's history.
*07:13.600- 07:20.600* :  The epicenter was about 70 kilometers southwest of Marrakesh in remote villages dotted
*07:20.600- 07:27.400* :  among the Atlas Mountains. The quake struck just before midnight on the Friday. A team of 63
*07:27.400- 07:34.440* :  volunteers from Isa or international search and rescue flew out to Marrakesh on the Sunday.
*07:34.440- 07:40.840* :  Their team leader, Russ Gordon, says he was overwhelmed by the welcome from local people.
*07:41.340- 07:44.020* :  When we got up into the mountain villages up into the Atlas Mountains,
*07:44.020- 07:48.500* :  the other people, absolutely unbelievable, supportive, offering us water,
*07:49.020- 07:53.780* :  but it was really, really humbling to see those people. When everything around them was falling down
*07:53.780- 07:58.520* :  they still offered us a smile and a welcome. Apart from water, what else did they provide?
*07:59.040- 08:03.800* :  All assistance support, obviously the language barriers for some of us trying to find out
*08:03.800- 08:08.120* :  as much information as we can, taking us to other villages that have been cut off, offering
*08:08.120- 08:13.360* :  a helping hand and loading of equipment. Were some local people getting involved in terms of
*08:13.500- 08:18.660* :  getting their hands dirty as well? Absolutely. The best rescuers out there and the people that
*08:18.660- 08:23.840* :  are at the thick end before we arrive are the local responders, the families, the people that are
*08:23.840- 08:27.980* :  there straight after the aftermath, they hold the best information, but the hardest workers
*08:27.980- 08:33.440* :  because they're absolutely trying to support their local villages, people they've known all their
*08:33.440- 08:38.660* :  lives, whereas you know we're a searching rescue team coming in to look for those deep-seated
*08:38.660- 08:44.220* :  victims under the rubble piles and it's quite challenging. The ISR team searched for victims
*08:44.220- 08:50.600* :  under the rubble of collapsed buildings with rescue dogs and specialist acoustic equipment.
*08:51.500- 08:55.140* :  They also treated many people for injuries and trauma.
*09:05.500- 09:09.380* :  Here they are teaching children's songs in a makeshift tented camp
*09:12.460- 09:17.780* :  and then when it was time to leave something else happened. There's a significant thing that
*09:17.780- 09:22.340* :  stuck out in my mind, it won't leave with me forever, we've done our final shift and we were
*09:22.340- 09:27.700* :  making a move for some rest and recuperation. There were two little boys no older than six or
*09:27.740- 09:32.480* :  seven years to the side of the road and they saluted the team when they went through and it'll
*09:32.480- 09:37.900* :  start to stick with me forever. I think that said it all for us as thanks. I don't think anybody
*09:37.900- 09:43.680* :  would ever have to say anything else. Ross Gordon's team also received a personal letter from
*09:43.680- 09:50.940* :  King Muhammad VI of Morocco thanking them for their help. They've now begun a five-day sponsored
*09:50.940- 09:57.520* :  walk revisiting villages in the Atlas Mountains and the money raised will go towards building a
*09:57.520- 10:04.440* :  new school and community center in the village of Izukak near the epicenter. Together with the
*10:04.440- 10:10.400* :  British ambassador Simon Martin they will lay a foundation stone of this new building. It's a
*10:10.400- 10:18.260* :  symbolic gesture but also after the devastation of a year ago a symbol of hope. Richard Hamilton reporting.
*10:19.140- 10:24.620* :  Now, have you ever wanted a birthday you could really remember? That was the case for Paul Barton
*10:24.620- 10:31.420* :  who's a pianist from England. When he turned 50 he had one wish to play the piano for elephants
*10:31.420- 10:38.320* :  in the wild and that is exactly what he did. Mobine as caught up with Paul and started by asking
*10:38.320- 10:44.760* :  where this idea came from. It was my 50th birthday and my wife wanted to do something special.
*10:45.220- 10:50.840* :  I said look my dream would be I just love to play one piece of music for an elephant for my
*10:50.840- 10:56.980* :  birthday. That's that's that would that would be my dream. I thought maybe the music therapy could
*10:56.980- 11:03.480* :  help elephants that had had stressful lives that had worked in tourism, logging trade. Maybe the
*11:03.480- 11:09.360* :  beautiful sounds of soothing classical music played with love and with expression might just
*11:09.360- 11:15.300* :  bring a little bit of comfort. There was nothing much more than that. So just a really practical question
*11:15.680- 11:22.480* :  how do you get such a beautiful piano into that space? Yeah. When we first started this project we
*11:22.480- 11:27.000* :  approached a number of piano stores and asked them would they hire a piano for the project and
*11:27.520- 11:34.980* :  oh absolutely no no no no you got to keep the piano in a room not take it outdoors. So
*11:35.640- 11:41.680* :  the first piano I took I made myself my wife and I we made it out of wood and we made it
*11:42.080- 11:48.420* :  like a flat pack piano to fit into a taxi that we could take out into the wilderness and play
*11:48.420- 11:53.480* :  for the elephants and then as time went by we were able to get acoustic pianos from my sponsor
*11:54.340- 12:01.280* :  in Vienna and we took those pianos out into the wiles and we paid piano movers to take them down
*12:01.340- 12:08.140* :  muddy rocky roads to the river and put them out in under the shade of a tree and we discovered
*12:08.140- 12:14.200* :  that it was the wooden acoustic pianos that made the kind of sounds that the elephants responded
*12:15.040- 12:20.920* :  I'd really like to understand what you what you see and also what you feel when these elephants
*12:21.040- 12:26.160* :  are in front of you and you're playing music to them. The younger elephants like to play with
*12:26.160- 12:34.520* :  certain squeaks of a guitar or a flute or they they really want to play with a clarinet. Then there
*12:34.520- 12:41.080* :  are the young elephants and male and female or sometimes male and male or female and female.
*12:41.780- 12:46.780* :  You play beautiful piece of melodic music and they will touch each other's heads with their
*12:46.780- 12:54.060* :  trunk and they will caress each other by their ears their face and it's an incredible thing to
*12:54.060- 13:00.020* :  see that. The mood suddenly changes from running through the mountain valley and then they hear
*13:00.020- 13:03.980* :  the music and then they suddenly stop and then start to caress each other. That was something
*13:03.980- 13:08.020* :  incredible to observe. Can you give me an example? What would be an example of something that's
*13:08.080- 13:13.940* :  calming, something that's going to soothe and reduce tension? One of the elephants I played for
*13:13.940- 13:19.800* :  was called Chai Chinna. He was a very dangerous bull elephant. Not only dangerous to humans,
*13:19.800- 13:26.340* :  dangerous to other elephants and dangerous to himself. Soothing, classical music seems to calm
*13:26.340- 13:33.080* :  the restlessness. So for example, I would play him a piece of music by Edward Elgar.
*13:40.160- 13:44.860* :  By trusting these pieces of music that were written sometimes hundreds of years ago by great
*13:44.860- 13:52.060* :  composers, sometimes I've almost stopped playing because I've been so surprised. They can also lift
*13:52.060- 13:58.460* :  their trunk and put the trunk over the piano onto the keys and sniff around and when they do
*13:58.460- 14:04.960* :  that it's in my experience it's been maybe the biggest privilege of my life. And you can hear more
*14:04.960- 14:11.200* :  from Paul on Outlook, wherever you get your BBC podcasts from. On the happy pod we like to find
*14:11.200- 14:16.280* :  the joy around the world to tell you. But sometimes we stumble across tales that are not necessarily
*14:16.380- 14:22.980* :  happy but more weird and wonderful, like this one. The Estonian police and border guard has gained
*14:22.980- 14:28.740* :  an unlikely recruit. He's Vilka and he's a hamster. Here's Tams and Selby to tell us more.
*14:29.120- 14:34.200* :  Vilka is the newest recruit working at the Eda Harryu Police Station in Estonia,
*14:34.200- 14:41.000* :  unlike all the other officers who work there. Vilka is a hamster. The story begins with a couple
*14:41.000- 14:46.200* :  breaking up and rowing over who got what. When the police got involved and the couple were dividing
*14:46.200- 14:53.260* :  up their belongings, neither wanted the hamster. Then officer Victoria Muracep stepped in. She's
*14:53.260- 14:59.400* :  an experienced rodent owner and already has two guinea pigs at home. She adopted Vilka and brought
*14:59.400- 15:05.920* :  him into work where he was an instant hit with the other officers. The Estonian broadcaster ERR
*15:05.920- 15:11.000* :  went to meet Vilka. It reported that he'd undergone observation training and had already
*15:11.000- 15:17.220* :  attended a meeting. According to Estonian police, there are currently no plans for Vilka to accompany
*15:17.220- 15:24.620* :  officers on patrol because, and I quote, he's more suited to office work. Tams and Selby reporting there.
*15:29.460- 15:34.080* :  Coming up in this podcast, I'm Samuel Massage in the World and for all the
*15:34.080- 15:40.380* :  refugees in the world, follow hope, follow freedom, follow peace. Meet the first member of the

*17:10.440- 17:16.280* :  To our listeners with a sweet tooth now, listen up. Scientists in Switzerland have come up with a
*17:16.280- 17:23.580* :  way to make chocolate using the entire cocoa fruit rather than just using the beans and without
*17:23.580- 17:28.700* :  adding sugar. They hope that this creation will allow people to indulge in their love for
*17:28.700- 17:33.640* :  chocolate without any of the health risks. They also claim that this so-called healthy chocolate
*17:33.640- 17:39.140* :  could be better for the environment and better for the cocoa farmers. As the happy pods,
*17:39.660- 17:42.380* :  as the happy pods, Abiona Boyer has been finding out.
*17:49.660- 17:55.060* :  We're spending over $133 billion on our sweet tooths for chocolate. And this is only expected
*17:55.060- 17:59.040* :  to shoot up to an eye-watering 182 billion in the next year.
*18:03.740- 18:08.320* :  But with a push to healthy eating, how can we reconcile our tastes with clean living?
*18:14.620- 18:18.920* :  Well, scientists at ETH Zurich, a public research university in Switzerland,
*18:18.920- 18:23.780* :  say they have a solution. By mashing up the sweet pulp together with the husk of a cocoa pod
*18:23.900- 18:28.320* :  and then adding it to the chocolate, they found a way to replace the crystalline sugar that's normally
*18:28.320- 18:33.340* :  added. Professor Eric Windhabb described to us what this healthy chocolate tastes and feels like.
*18:33.480- 18:39.400* :  It tastes like chocolate with a fruity sweetness, which is a bit peach, lychee-like people.
*18:39.400- 18:44.880* :  This is how people describe it. It has a great melt. It has a great, let's say, after flavour,
*18:44.880- 18:50.720* :  as we call it. Due to this fruity note, the flavour taste part is a new one and a fascinating one.
*18:50.980- 18:54.060* :  And it's not just health benefits that this new chocolate claims to offer.
*18:54.060- 18:59.080* :  Its makers say it could also change the way cocoa is farmed and how farmers are paid.
*18:59.080- 19:06.140* :  The major benefit from a sustainability perspective is you use a big portion of the whole fruit,
*19:06.340- 19:11.380* :  because otherwise you would have thrown it away. So there is more chances to do also in the country.
*19:11.380- 19:15.980* :  So we have collaborations in Ghana now. There is now a factory built harvesting.
*19:15.980- 19:20.500* :  These juice concentrating the juice, so all these these sweetening part of it.
*19:20.500- 19:26.780* :  And that means there is value creation in the country already, quite remarkable.
*19:27.140- 19:33.340* :  Explore it how can we maybe best pay peer to peer in order to have more income to the cocoa farmers.
*19:39.060- 19:42.560* :  Take it easy with Cadbury's caramel.
*19:43.280- 19:44.580* :  Abiona Boya reporting.
*19:45.520- 19:51.120* :  A mother of two is thought to have set a new world record for the fastest female swim across
*19:51.120- 19:59.920* :  Lake Geneva. The 73 kilometre swim took Sam Farrow 22 hours and 48 minutes of continuous swimming.
*20:00.460- 20:05.520* :  She only stopped to tread water while she had some food or drink or occasionally to relieve cramp
*20:05.520- 20:11.700* :  and backache. The BBC's Sarah Montague spoke to Sam about her achievement and started by asking her
*20:12.100- 20:13.760* :  if she thought the feat was achievable.
*20:14.500- 20:18.980* :  When we booked the swim originally, I just wanted to see how far I could go. I wanted to see
*20:18.980- 20:22.740* :  you if I could finish it. Never in my wildest dreams that I think I would be the fastest woman.
*20:23.380- 20:25.720* :  We went about five hours faster than I was expecting.
*20:26.140- 20:30.380* :  And why was that? What was what were you thinking as you were going across the lake?
*20:30.700- 20:35.200* :  I'm not sure to be honest. I think I had just I don't know whether it underestimated my
*20:35.200- 20:39.740* :  own abilities or whether the currents on the day were just particularly in my favour.
*20:40.240- 20:46.840* :  I think it was just a really good combination of good weather, good currents and just being
*20:46.840- 20:49.780* :  stronger than I thought it was. It just goes to show what your body can achieve.
*20:50.060- 20:55.520* :  Congratulations on doing it. You don't quite know yet whether you have set the world record on this
*20:55.520- 20:58.540* :  for a woman swimming across Lake Geneva.
*20:59.100- 21:02.680* :  So it is the fastest female time but it's not officially ratified yet.
*21:02.920- 21:07.620* :  Okay, well can you talk us through what happens? Because the idea of swimming 22 hours
*21:07.620- 21:11.720* :  continuously. It's incomprehensible to a lot of us.
*21:11.840- 21:16.840* :  I felt really good until about 55k in actually which was unexpected.
*21:17.220- 21:21.720* :  My longest previous swim was about 36 kilometres so everything after that was unknown
*21:22.140- 21:28.020* :  for myself and the crew. About 55k my back really started to fatigue and that's when
*21:28.120- 21:30.020* :  yeah the cramps and the pain really started.
*21:30.260- 21:32.840* :  Are you doing one stroke throughout the swim?
*21:33.080- 21:34.880* :  Yeah, the whole thing is on freestyle on front crawl.
*21:35.200- 21:37.940* :  And obviously at times you're going you're in the middle of the night.
*21:38.240- 21:40.520* :  Yeah, so I had about 10 hours of complete darkness.
*21:40.980- 21:45.440* :  How do you mentally, what are you thinking during that time when you're in pain,
*21:45.440- 21:47.940* :  you're getting cramps and you've got a long way to go?
*21:48.180- 21:49.940* :  It was just about trying to keep the mind positive.
*21:49.940- 21:52.720* :  I think your mind gives in long before your body gives in.
*21:52.720- 21:56.680* :  So if you can keep your head positive, you can get there in the end.
*21:56.680- 22:00.140* :  So every time that my brain tried to tell me that I couldn't do it,
*22:00.460- 22:03.060* :  I just tried to try and flip it and think right it's 4am.
*22:03.460- 22:05.540* :  You're in the middle of late Geneva, how special is this?
*22:05.600- 22:07.260* :  Not many people get the chance to do this.
*22:07.680- 22:10.740* :  And I was also really lucky that I had two women on my crew,
*22:11.240- 22:14.480* :  Jane and Claire, who alternated, Claire would swim for an hour with me.
*22:14.700- 22:17.820* :  And then my friend, Jane, would get in the kayak and kayak for an hour with me.
*22:17.940- 22:19.020* :  So I was never on my own.
*22:19.240- 22:20.300* :  It's very much a team sport.
*22:20.500- 22:23.540* :  It was just the present so I could just see the light or the odd paddle
*22:23.820- 22:25.300* :  from the kayak.
*22:25.300- 22:27.820* :  So it was just knowing that someone was there next to me.
*22:28.040- 22:30.400* :  And I read that you get chopped food and drink on a rope.
*22:30.760- 22:31.220* :  What do you eat?
*22:31.340- 22:34.380* :  Can you possibly eat during when you're doing that?
*22:34.920- 22:36.920* :  So I have carbohydrate powders mixed with cordial.
*22:37.260- 22:38.740* :  We had vegetable soup.
*22:39.120- 22:42.380* :  I had kindle mink cake and things like that, little cakes,
*22:42.960- 22:43.700* :  just to keep me going.
*22:44.080- 22:46.500* :  And then the feeling when you did it, what was that like?
*22:47.640- 22:49.380* :  What's a relief that was on dry land?
*22:50.040- 22:51.740* :  But also I don't think it's quite kicked in yet.
*22:51.760- 22:53.960* :  I've not really had the emotions yet.
*22:54.020- 22:55.480* :  I think it's all a bit of a shock still.
*22:55.620- 22:57.180* :  We'll plan another big swim for next year.
*22:57.380- 23:00.180* :  If we can do 70k, let's see how far we can go really.
*23:00.480- 23:02.000* :  Incredible, Sam Farrow there.
*23:02.600- 23:04.880* :  And now another sporting accomplishment.
*23:05.260- 23:08.620* :  This time at the Paralympics, where one woman has become the first member
*23:08.620- 23:12.560* :  of the Paralympic refugee team to win an Olympic medal.
*23:13.260- 23:15.760* :  Zakia Kudadadi, who's from Afghanistan,
*23:16.420- 23:20.220* :  won bronze in one of the Para Taekwondo categories in Paris,
*23:20.600- 23:23.880* :  defying the Taliban's wishes that women do not play sport.
*23:23.880- 23:28.860* :  She says she hopes her achievement sends a message for all the refugees in the world
*23:28.860- 23:30.080* :  to follow hope.
*23:30.080- 23:33.760* :  And she dedicated her win to all the women in Afghanistan.
*23:34.540- 23:35.960* :  Stephanie Brentis has this report.
*23:36.940- 23:40.600* :  I'm so happy and I'm so proud for for this medal.
*23:40.880- 23:43.380* :  Because after two, three years I work hard,
*23:44.380- 23:47.300* :  with regime, with problem, with all but I'm being.
*23:47.520- 23:48.560* :  This is for me's dream.
*23:48.560- 23:50.280* :  And now it's true.
*23:50.880- 23:54.560* :  Zakia Kudadadi fled her home country of Afghanistan
*23:54.560- 23:58.200* :  after going into hiding when the Taliban swept into Kabul
*23:58.520- 24:00.620* :  and seized power three years ago.
*24:01.080- 24:04.360* :  Since then, the regime has cracked down on women's rights,
*24:04.780- 24:06.400* :  including playing any sports,
*24:06.940- 24:09.060* :  and there have been widespread reports of abuse.
*24:09.840- 24:15.180* :  Today, in my country, life is not easy for all the women
*24:15.380- 24:19.080* :  and girls because Taliban in Afghanistan
*24:19.080- 24:22.220* :  and everything is finished for all the women.
*24:22.780- 24:26.700* :  Maybe for this medal, all the women continue life
*24:26.700- 24:32.400* :  and continue fight with Taliban and maybe we are together
*24:32.400- 24:34.400* :  in peace in my country.
*24:34.980- 24:38.600* :  The 25-year-old, who competes with one functional arm,
*24:38.600- 24:42.600* :  was given refuge in France and started a new life in Paris.
*24:43.280- 24:45.240* :  Back in her home province of Harat,
*24:45.240- 24:47.520* :  there was always a Taliban presence,
*24:47.520- 24:50.040* :  even when the group were not in charge.
*24:50.040- 24:53.380* :  And Zakia trained at home in order to feel safe.
*24:53.880- 24:56.840* :  She says now, having the support of the French people
*24:56.840- 24:59.220* :  and world-renowned Taikwondo coaches,
*24:59.640- 25:01.700* :  has allowed her to fulfill her potential.
*25:02.280- 25:05.640* :  After left my country, I continue my sport in French.
*25:06.060- 25:09.520* :  I am very, very progress in my sport, Taikwondo,
*25:10.020- 25:12.060* :  with my best coach, Habin Yare,
*25:12.700- 25:15.280* :  because in Afghanistan, I am continuing to take wonder
*25:15.280- 25:16.640* :  but it's not very professional,
*25:16.640- 25:20.220* :  because in Afghanistan, it's dangerous,
*25:20.220- 25:23.640* :  but here in French, everything is perfect.
*25:23.660- 25:28.480* :  Next, Zakia plans to compete at the Los Angeles Paralympics
*25:28.480- 25:32.100* :  in 2028, says any medal she gets
*25:32.100- 25:34.160* :  offer all the world refugees,
*25:34.660- 25:36.760* :  and that next time she's going for gold.
*25:37.380- 25:40.900* :  I'm Senua massage in the world and for all the refugees in the world,
*25:41.960- 25:44.480* :  follow hope, follow freedom, follow peace.
*25:45.300- 25:47.160* :  That report was by Stephanie Prentice.
*25:47.780- 25:49.820* :  Many of us have had that one teacher
*25:49.820- 25:52.000* :  who made a lasting impact on our lives,
*25:52.200- 25:54.120* :  whether it was through their passion for the subject,
*25:54.120- 25:57.020* :  their teaching style, or the way they believed in us.
*25:57.020- 25:59.000* :  They leave a lasting legacy, don't they?
*25:59.300- 26:02.620* :  Mine was Mr. Tember who managed to inspire me with his joy
*26:02.620- 26:05.080* :  for mixing up things in the chemistry lab.
*26:05.700- 26:09.000* :  For many South Africans, their inspiration was William Smith,
*26:09.000- 26:11.940* :  the famous TV science and maths educator.
*26:12.560- 26:15.640* :  Tributes have been pouring in following the news of his death,
*26:15.640- 26:19.100* :  after a short battle with cancer. He was 85 years old.
*26:19.360- 26:22.380* :  Ella Bicknell looks back on the impact he had on his students.
*26:23.280- 26:25.520* :  So why is going to be a quarter of X,
*26:25.940- 26:29.360* :  which comes out to be 2,500,000?
*26:29.760- 26:30.920* :  Now he has a tricky problem.
*26:31.200- 26:32.940* :  William Smith had a simple vision,
*26:33.240- 26:35.980* :  bringing education to everyone no matter who they were
*26:36.200- 26:37.200* :  and where they came from.
*26:37.200- 26:39.960* :  A top science graduate from Rhodes University,
*26:39.960- 26:43.720* :  Smith was on track to a lucrative career in the explosives industry.
*26:44.240- 26:46.400* :  However, his true passion was teaching.
*26:47.020- 26:50.020* :  In the 1970s, he ran his first multi-racial school,
*26:50.020- 26:52.580* :  despite backlash from a party to authorities.
*26:52.580- 26:55.120* :  He also set up Pre-University School,
*26:55.440- 26:58.840* :  an organisation which prepared students for their first year of studies.
*26:58.840- 27:03.080* :  It was quickly adopted by all major universities in South Africa.
*27:03.520- 27:05.900* :  So it's going to be a third of a quarter of X,
*27:05.920- 27:11.180* :  you know what the answer is, it's 833,333.
*27:11.600- 27:14.580* :  But he became a universal name with his daytime programme,
*27:14.900- 27:15.620* :  The Learning Channel.
*27:16.080- 27:19.320* :  A self-taught filmmaker, he spent years convincing public broadcaster,
*27:19.320- 27:22.900* :  SABC, to put him on air and bring his lessons to the masses.
*27:23.640- 27:26.320* :  Millions of South Africans tuned in to hear his warm,
*27:26.320- 27:29.260* :  enthusiastic voice and watch his border marker
*27:29.260- 27:32.340* :  stained hands break down Matt's problems step by step.
*27:32.380- 27:35.340* :  One of those children watching, Johann Ferreira,
*27:35.560- 27:38.920* :  he's now a professor at the University of Pretoria's statistics department.
*27:39.180- 27:43.280* :  Mathematics and science is supposed to be for everyone,
*27:43.280- 27:45.860* :  even if you do not become a scientist.
*27:46.400- 27:51.720* :  And I think the digestible way that he introduced and covered concepts
*27:52.400- 27:53.200* :  was essential.
*27:53.760- 27:56.040* :  These days, education resources are everywhere.
*27:56.500- 27:59.560* :  B.O. Hunt says Mr. Smith was always ahead of the curve.
*27:59.980- 28:03.100* :  You can watch YouTube videos, you can watch many different things.
*28:03.940- 28:06.460* :  But I like to think of William Smith
*28:06.940- 28:11.140* :  as the original science content creator of South Africa.
*28:11.780- 28:18.020* :  And it was presented in such a fantastic national free-to-view platform.
*28:18.680- 28:21.780* :  As well as an academic resource, for many of those watching,
*28:21.780- 28:23.580* :  he served a pastoral role.
*28:23.800- 28:25.120* :  He was a friend, a mentor,
*28:25.720- 28:29.220* :  a point made by radio presenter Anelae Mododa in her tribute
*28:29.220- 28:31.640* :  on the 947 Jobo Breakfast Show.
*28:32.160- 28:35.120* :  Sometimes, that was the only time somebody had a parent
*28:35.120- 28:36.480* :  to help them with their homework.
*28:36.840- 28:38.900* :  So the ties are definitely academic,
*28:38.900- 28:41.140* :  but I think they just run so much stronger,
*28:41.140- 28:45.740* :  like they run into fiber and morals and ethics and love and consistency,
*28:45.760- 28:47.280* :  which is what love is.
*28:47.280- 28:51.580* :  When you switch the TV on in the afternoon, William Smith was there.
*28:51.980- 28:54.920* :  Smith received many notable accolades in his lifetime,
*28:54.940- 28:58.460* :  including Teacher of the Year and an honorary life membership
*28:58.460- 29:00.060* :  of the Golden Key International,
*29:00.060- 29:03.740* :  an organization dedicated to academics around the world.
*29:04.260- 29:06.960* :  By far, his most significant, the Order of Bayer Bab,
*29:06.960- 29:09.680* :  the highest accolade bestowed to any South African,
*29:09.680- 29:13.320* :  presented to him by Cyril Ramaphosa in 2019.
*29:13.340- 29:15.940* :  The South African president said William Smith
*29:15.940- 29:19.080* :  deemed mystified mathematics unscience for generations.
*29:19.180- 29:22.580* :  He was an education and cultural icon.
*29:28.880- 29:30.460* :  That's all from the happy part for now.
