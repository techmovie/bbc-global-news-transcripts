*01:19.800- 01:22.680* :  This is the happy pod from the BBC World Service.
*01:26.740- 01:31.620* :  I'm Janet Gillil and in this edition, dream big, dream audaciously and grow for it.
*01:31.980- 01:37.120* :  We hear from a woman who's defied the odds to fulfil her childhood dream of becoming an astronaut.
*01:37.780- 01:41.640* :  I used to love lying on the beach looking up at the stars above me,
*01:41.640- 01:47.880* :  that childlike curiosity gave me such a drive to explore them. Also how a car accident
*01:47.880- 01:52.180* :  prompted a photographer to share his skills with children in bellies.
*01:52.480- 01:57.700* :  Life is too short to be so selfish and I like to say in trying to figure out a way to heal
*01:57.700- 02:03.400* :  myself. I figure out a way to change the world. We visit a school for older people in an
*02:03.460- 02:10.660* :  Indian village and the wobbling online sensation that has one heart in Thailand and beyond.
*02:16.760- 02:22.060* :  We start with a woman who's made her childhood dreams come true with a giant leap in the world
*02:22.060- 02:28.560* :  of space exploration. After 13 months of rigorous training, Catherine Bernelpeg qualified with
*02:28.560- 02:34.780* :  the European Space Agency earlier this year as a first astronaut to officially represent Australia.
*02:35.500- 02:39.700* :  In the past, Australians who went into space had to do so under another country's flag.
*02:40.340- 02:44.880* :  Catherine, who's 39 and has two daughters, had worked as a space engineer in six different
*02:44.880- 02:50.080* :  countries before eagerly moving back home when Australia established its own space agency six
*02:50.080- 02:55.540* :  years ago. And she hopes her achievement will inspire others to pursue careers in what are known
*02:55.540- 03:01.540* :  as STEM subjects, science, technology, engineering and maths. She's been speaking to the happy
*03:01.540- 03:07.460* :  pods Isabella Jewel. It's an incredible honor to be the first to represent Australia as a qualified
*03:07.460- 03:14.040* :  astronaut. When I was a young kid growing up with the childhood astronaut dream, I never thought
*03:14.040- 03:20.340* :  I'd have the chance to do so representing my home country. And so it's really pinched me staff
*03:20.340- 03:26.240* :  to now be mission ready. And I'm excited, not just for me, but for what it can mean to unlock
*03:26.240- 03:32.820* :  opportunity for more in Australia, our scientists, our engineers, our educators. And hopefully also
*03:32.820- 03:36.820* :  list the aspirations of young people across our country, whatever their dreams may be.
*03:37.080- 03:41.220* :  Take me back to when you were that young child who was focused on becoming an astronaut.
*03:41.680- 03:45.580* :  What was it about space and being an astronaut that really inspired you?
*03:45.860- 03:51.760* :  When I was young, it was for the adventure. I used to love lying on the beach looking up at the
*03:51.760- 03:56.980* :  stars above me. And when I learned that some of those stars were not just twinkly lights,
*03:56.980- 04:02.120* :  but actually entire planets worlds that humans had never explored, that childlike curiosity
*04:02.220- 04:06.800* :  gave me such a drive to explore them. I was a kid that like looking under every rock, like
*04:06.800- 04:11.820* :  climbing every tree and asking of why a lot annoying all the people around me probably, but
*04:12.160- 04:19.540* :  that curiosity evolved into a real determination. When I was a teenager, our school had our first
*04:19.540- 04:25.240* :  career counseling session from about 14. And they asked us to write down three options and I only
*04:25.240- 04:30.220* :  wrote down astronaut. My school and my parents said, we'll go figure out what that would take,
*04:30.220- 04:35.300* :  probably thinking that would help me say sense. But actually, what I found out was that to be an
*04:35.300- 04:40.980* :  astronaut is the combination of any STEM career your passion takes you down. You can be a scientist
*04:40.980- 04:48.000* :  an engineer, a doctor, a pilot. You should be someone that enjoys sports and expeditions and
*04:48.000- 04:53.340* :  have some time living internationally. And that all just sounded great. So it progressed from the
*04:53.340- 04:59.000* :  desire for adventure to the desire to contribute to helping have concrete steps forward in human
*04:59.000- 05:03.440* :  discovery. And now as an astronaut, after having spent almost 15 years as a space engineer,
*05:03.960- 05:10.800* :  I also really value space for how it can underpin our society and help improve life on earth as well.
*05:11.080- 05:15.100* :  You've not yet been to space. Do you have any planned missions coming up soon?
*05:15.580- 05:21.080* :  Not yet. So I graduated from what's called basic astronaut training in April this year. So it's
*05:21.080- 05:27.300* :  early days for me, but it's an incredibly exciting time to be an astronaut. Humanity is going back
*05:27.300- 05:32.240* :  to the moon, not to walk, but to work and to discover fundamental things about the formation
*05:32.780- 05:36.920* :  of our earth moon system that can help us understand things like climate change. The kind of
*05:36.920- 05:42.660* :  research we can do in the unique environment of microgravity is research that cannot be done on
*05:42.660- 05:49.600* :  Earth, whether that's research into new medicines or conditions or new materials technology is like
*05:49.600- 05:55.060* :  robotics. Fascinating stuff. And you know, if you were to go to space, what is it that would be
*05:55.060- 05:58.480* :  the most exciting element of that experience for you?
*05:58.760- 06:04.160* :  Oh, well, to go to space, representing my country, representing humanity would be such an honor.
*06:04.620- 06:10.700* :  I want to go, of course, with a suite of scientific and technology research experiments.
*06:10.700- 06:16.460* :  I would, of course, love a spacewalk every astronaut would love a spacewalk, you know, to step out
*06:16.460- 06:23.000* :  of that airlock and be surrounded personally by space outside the space suit and see the beauty
*06:23.000- 06:28.100* :  of the planet. We live on at the same time, you know, with a spinner in hand to go and do work out
*06:28.100- 06:34.380* :  there would be amazing. Today, the ultimate destination for any astronaut is the moon. That would be
*06:34.380- 06:38.260* :  the dream, I think, of most rookie astronauts like myself today.
*06:38.540- 06:43.380* :  And what message would you give to other people, other young children, young adults who are looking
*06:43.380- 06:48.300* :  to become astronauts in the future? I tell them to absolutely pursue the astronaut dream.
*06:48.940- 06:52.700* :  You know, becoming an astronaut is a cherry on the top of any STEM career they're passion
*06:52.700- 06:57.180* :  takes and two. And if they're in a STEM career, they're at the center of discovery and have the
*06:57.180- 07:01.320* :  ability to solve the great problems facing our worlds. And when you're an astronaut, you're part
*07:01.320- 07:06.500* :  of the solutions too. So for people that want to be an astronaut, dream big, dream audaciously
*07:06.500- 07:12.320* :  and go for it. So who says mass homework can't be exciting? That was Catherine Bernelpeg talking
*07:12.320- 07:17.300* :  to Isabella Jewel. Now, we often ask you to get in touch with stories you think will make us
*07:17.300- 07:22.400* :  all smile. And listeners Susan Gilkey did just that to tell us about a group of young people
*07:22.400- 07:27.780* :  in Belize who are being given the chance to change their own lives. The part of a photography
*07:27.780- 07:33.400* :  camp set up three years ago to offer children from some of the most turbulent areas in the south
*07:33.400- 07:39.500* :  side of Belize city, the skills to compete with professionals from around the world. It was founded
*07:39.500- 07:45.160* :  by the country's United Black Association for Development with funding from the widow of a citizen
*07:45.160- 07:51.540* :  of Belize who'd moved to the US, bread a cliff augustine. The happy pods Holly Gibbs spoke to
*07:51.540- 07:57.660* :  three of the students, Navine and Sheree, who are both 10, along with 17-year-old Sodee. And to
*07:57.660- 08:02.620* :  the main teacher, professional photographer Menleck Marin Coleman, who explained that the camp
*08:02.620- 08:08.160* :  came about when he returned home to Belize to recover after fracturing his wrist in a car accident.
*08:09.040- 08:14.240* :  I discovered that there was an opportunity here for me to impact the youth on a personal level
*08:14.580- 08:18.120* :  that if I could never shoot again at the best thing that I could do was teach the children
*08:18.120- 08:25.420* :  of Belize a craft and a skill that can help them further. This ability to take care of themselves,
*08:25.420- 08:29.480* :  the ability to fund their own community, the ability to be historians in their own story.
*08:29.760- 08:35.120* :  Wow, so you took something bad that happened to you and turned it around into this camp. That's
*08:35.120- 08:40.560* :  amazing. How does that feel? In the moment, I think it was it was all a part of my healing process,
*08:40.560- 08:46.560* :  but three years later, looking at all the exhibitions, these students are amazing photographers.
*08:46.560- 08:51.380* :  Like, absolutely, absolutely amazing. Just raw god-given talent. It feels amazing. It's very
*08:51.380- 08:55.960* :  fulfilling. It's healing a part of myself that was deeper than just my wrist, you know what I mean?
*08:55.960- 09:00.800* :  Like giving back and impacting the community on a positive level and actually putting money
*09:00.800- 09:05.420* :  in photographers' pockets. And Navine, can you tell me a bit about your love for taking photos?
*09:05.420- 09:10.660* :  Why'd you like to take photos so much? I love taking photos because it helps me
*09:10.660- 09:15.980* :  capture the moment and bring back memories that I probably wouldn't have just remembered in my mind.
*09:15.980- 09:19.700* :  And I'm learning new things and making bonds with amazing people.
*09:20.120- 09:26.240* :  And Sharif, how does photography make you feel? It makes me feel wonderful that I can meet new people,
*09:26.300- 09:36.260* :  new people and friends that I didn't know. My memories will be a boat. If I was not in the
*09:36.260- 09:41.340* :  photographer gap, I would don't know anything about pictures, taking pictures.
*09:42.080- 09:45.800* :  What about you, Zoday? When I started, I was a bit shy. I was
*09:45.800- 09:53.120* :  learning to share more of an artist person. So the photography kind of opened my eyes to a new
*09:53.120- 09:58.500* :  hobby. I want to do it more now. My camera has taken me all over the world. So my goal is to create
*09:58.500- 10:03.040* :  more photographers and more artists. I'm hoping that at the end of the camp, each of my students
*10:03.040- 10:07.420* :  will have professional portfolios, to have books done, to have pieces in international galleries.
*10:07.420- 10:11.780* :  Belize is such a beautiful place. People come all around the world as two photos of Belize.
*10:11.980- 10:17.660* :  How does it feel when you see your students photography on display? What sense of pride do you get?
*10:17.700- 10:23.860* :  It is amazing. I am every year. They completely blow me away. There are photographs on the walls
*10:23.860- 10:28.940* :  for the last exhibitions that I really can't believe a nine-year-old took, or a ten-year-old took,
*10:28.940- 10:34.860* :  or I can't express how proud and amazed I am. Could you all tell me what your favorite photo
*10:34.860- 10:39.640* :  that you've ever taken is? Let's start with you, Zoday. I remember I saw this boat,
*10:39.640- 10:44.540* :  sailboat, and it was just quite perfect at the moment, and the sun was setting up at the same time.
*10:45.160- 10:50.060* :  So I quickly grabbed the digital camera and I quickly snapped it. I went and looked at it. I just
*10:50.060- 10:56.120* :  was like, wow, I did that. And I showed Uncle Malik, and he was like, you got it, girl!
*10:56.360- 11:03.000* :  Yeah, that's kind of my favorite photo. My favorite photo that I ever taken is this year at
*11:03.000- 11:10.080* :  Placencia, Wayne. One month it's picking up a love story, a love story. And Naveen?
*11:10.400- 11:17.080* :  We went on a road trip and there was this really old house. It was with backgrounds like mountain,
*11:17.080- 11:21.420* :  and then the bottom was just landscape, and it was really old. It looked like it was burned.
*11:21.940- 11:27.140* :  And so I went on a certain angle and snapped the picture, and it's definitely one of my favorites
*11:27.140- 11:32.040* :  in one of the most experienced photos I've ever taken. Does photography make you happy?
*11:32.680- 11:39.600* :  Yes, ma'am, it does. Yes, taking photos then make me happy because I experienced stuff,
*11:39.660- 11:48.520* :  I love that in the perfect angle. It really does make me happy. It makes me feel quite peaceful,
*11:48.520- 11:52.060* :  and there's nothing really bothering me, and I'm just being myself.
*11:52.540- 11:55.760* :  I'm sorry, it's one of those things that it kind of never leaves you. Even if you don't do it
*11:55.980- 12:00.220* :  professionally, all my students are getting used to seeing themselves in a positive life,
*12:00.220- 12:05.420* :  seeing their community in a positive life, and showing that to the world. And also keeping their
*12:05.420- 12:10.240* :  own histories. We hold time in our hands, we hold, we are the ones that choose the moments to keep.
*12:10.620- 12:15.580* :  And what's your message to other people about turning around a bad situation and giving back
*12:15.580- 12:21.240* :  to your community? Life is too short to be so selfish, and I realized, I could
*12:21.620- 12:25.240* :  pity myself forever about, you know, never being able to shoot again or I could do something about
*12:25.240- 12:29.060* :  it, and I like to say, in trying to figure out a way, you're going to heal myself, I figure
*12:29.060- 12:34.100* :  out a way to change the world in a small way, but in fact, I would say it's not about how you
*12:34.100- 12:39.360* :  start by how you finish. Menlick, marrying Coleman, and his students, Navine,
*12:39.360- 12:45.000* :  Cherif and Zody, sharing their love of photography. You can see all the photos from the camp
*12:45.000- 12:51.540* :  over the last three years at keepitsimplyorganic.com. And if like Susan, you want to send us a story
*12:51.540- 13:01.200* :  that's inspired you, the email address is globalpodcastatbbc.co.uk. Now it's been an upsetting year
*13:01.200- 13:05.860* :  for animal lovers in Turkey, after the government approved a law to round up the country's many
*13:05.860- 13:11.520* :  stray dogs and put them in shelters. But one rescue centre says the move has also led to a
*13:11.520- 13:17.020* :  surge in demand from people wanting to give them new homes abroad, as Shantar Hartle explains.
*13:21.660- 13:27.920* :  Meet Dali and Dizi. They've once roamed the streets of Turkey, but are now enjoying life in
*13:27.920- 13:33.640* :  their new adopted homes in the Netherlands. Turkey is estimated to have 4 million stray dogs,
*13:34.160- 13:40.660* :  but existing shelters only have capacity for 100,000, so finding a safe place for all of them is a big
*13:40.660- 13:46.820* :  challenge. Neil Gulsaya, who runs the shelter near Istanbul, says demand for adoption from people
*13:46.820- 13:57.360* :  outside Turkey has risen since the law was passed. We have around 20 or 25 dogs ready to fly.
*13:57.360- 14:02.480* :  People will continue to reach out to us, she said. I hope that we will send more dogs soon.
*14:02.640- 14:04.140* :  They will all have good homes.
*14:09.440- 14:15.660* :  Sending dogs to the EU is a long and expensive process. A necessary paperwork and vaccinations
*14:15.680- 14:23.480* :  can take a few months and costs in excess of $1,000. But it was a price worth paying for Dizi's new
*14:23.480- 14:29.020* :  foster owner, Caroline Dilemon, who lives just outside Amsterdam. She was mourning the death of
*14:29.020- 14:34.700* :  her dog when she heard about the situation in Turkey and wanted to help. She said Dizi was now
*14:34.700- 14:44.040* :  settled in her new home. She's very open, like an open book. She hasn't got any anxiety to
*14:44.040- 14:52.980* :  which other dogs. She's really happy going outside, running around in the water or playing with other
*14:52.980- 15:04.380* :  dogs. Also she's really happy. Back in Turkey, animal lovers have come up with other ways to
*15:04.380- 15:09.860* :  protect street dogs. Some companies are adopting strays for their offices and a number of vets are
*15:09.860- 15:16.000* :  offering free vaccinations for those who adopt animals from the streets. Well, that report by
*15:16.000- 15:26.560* :  Chantal Hartle. Coming up in this podcast, I do seem to be someone that can look at a problem
*15:27.200- 15:31.860* :  and come up with a solution to solve it. And I am a true believer that when communities work
*15:31.860- 15:37.380* :  together, great things can be achieved. The New Zealand woman who's brought a sense of community

*17:11.000- 17:17.520* :  young women committed to empowering senior citizens in their village. Arshdeep Kaua from BBC Punjabi
*17:24.740- 17:30.120* :  has been finding out more. This is baby wapu school in Punjab. Its mission is to educate the elders of
*17:30.220- 17:36.920* :  Balo village. Baby wapu means mother and father. Words that are fondly used to refer to older
*17:36.920- 17:43.220* :  people in Punjabi. The school was started in January by two young women Rajwinder Kaur and
*17:43.220- 17:48.640* :  Jislin Kaur who wanted to make sure that no one in the village remained illiterate.
*17:51.700- 17:57.220* :  Initially the task was to teach them to sign their names but after their enthusiastic response
*17:57.220- 18:04.860* :  the elders are now learning to read, write and even count. Mohinder Singh who's 85 is one of them.
*18:12.940- 18:19.600* :  I have learnt to sign my name. I can count from one to hundred and I have learnt Punjabi
*18:19.600- 18:25.640* :  alphabets. It was not difficult. I feel happy and not shy to write now.
*18:31.160- 18:36.360* :  The school is run in the village library with more than 80 elderly men and women attending for
*18:36.360- 18:46.080* :  three hours a day, six days a week. All the classes are taught for free. Most of the serencs
*18:46.080- 18:52.240* :  are over 60 years of age and could not attend school when they were younger, mainly due to poverty.
*18:53.060- 18:57.320* :  75 years old Mohinder Singh is also one of the students here.
*19:01.020- 19:06.740* :  I could not go to school in my childhood. I did farming. My family could not afford education.
*19:07.420- 19:09.380* :  Now I am taught how to read and write.
*19:12.440- 19:19.380* :  Jiswinder Kaur who is 75 years old had also never attended school before. She's now learning how to write.
*19:24.100- 19:29.640* :  I used to see people read and write. I always wanted to learn and sign my name instead of
*19:29.640- 19:36.800* :  thumb stamping. Once they learn to sign their names, the students get reward of 100 Indian rupees,
*19:36.800- 19:42.600* :  which is equivalent to a dollar and twenty cents. But their teacher Rajwinder Kaur says,
*19:42.620- 19:48.420* :  it's the desire to learn more and be able to read their favorite books and religious texts
*19:48.860- 19:51.060* :  that make them attend classes every day.
*19:53.960- 19:59.900* :  It's up to the villagers if they want to sign up. We have 80 students and we run two classes.
*20:00.800- 20:07.140* :  First, our plan was to teach them how to sign their names. The elders themselves wanted to
*20:07.140- 20:10.020* :  learn Punjabi alphabet and we are happily teaching them.
*20:10.020- 20:22.440* :  That report by Ashdeep Kaur proving that it's never too late to learn.
*20:23.140- 20:27.000* :  Now, how well do you know your neighbours and would you be able to turn to them for support
*20:27.000- 20:33.520* :  in difficult times? When riots broke out in the UK back in 2011, Emma Rigby who lives in
*20:33.520- 20:38.540* :  North London found herself longing for the sense of community she'd grown up with in New Zealand.
*20:39.400- 20:43.960* :  Realising she had no one she could reach out to left her with a desire to make a difference,
*20:43.960- 20:49.440* :  not just for herself but for all the people living around her. So she founded a network called
*20:49.440- 20:55.440* :  Love Your Doorstep in the area of London where she lives in Nfield. I asked Emma to take me back to
*20:55.440- 21:01.720* :  the night of the riots. So we had burnt out cars, we had people breaking down brick walls
*21:01.740- 21:07.540* :  and breaking into local shops and looting and people running around with masks on and dogs and
*21:07.540- 21:14.660* :  it was just extremely scary that night. We had to barricade our front doors, I had two young children
*21:16.100- 21:21.600* :  and it was that night that I thought I don't even know who my neighbours are, this is crazy.
*21:21.940- 21:28.140* :  But I kind of made a decision, I thought well I've two decisions, I thought I either go back to
*21:28.140- 21:34.220* :  New Zealand or take my kids home or I'm going to stay and I'm going to change this and it almost
*21:34.220- 21:40.220* :  became like this personal mission of mine to bring our community together and it's been a personal
*21:40.220- 21:47.440* :  mission of mine now for the past 13 years. And I understand that you have 30,000 members,
*21:47.440- 21:53.660* :  that's quite an achievement. Yeah I think what's amazing about our community is it's been organically
*21:53.660- 22:01.660* :  growing over 13 years. So we've just hit 34,000. We really nurture the group, it's not really about
*22:01.660- 22:06.880* :  numbers for us, it's about how engaged the community is and how much people are gathering or
*22:06.880- 22:12.600* :  how much we're able to point people in the right direction for what they need. So it really
*22:12.600- 22:17.240* :  has been an organic growth of local people wanting to be part of love your doorstep.
*22:17.820- 22:21.940* :  One of our projects that we set up five years ago off the back of love your doorstep
*22:22.680- 22:28.000* :  was the love your doorstep community patrol. Very passionate about this so we were, I was called
*22:28.000- 22:35.460* :  into a local infield school because 19 of the young boys had been robbed for their mobile phones
*22:35.460- 22:41.340* :  and money. Anyway long story short we decided to, well I decided to set up a community patrol scheme.
*22:41.340- 22:48.900* :  Within five years we've now got just over 150 volunteers and they put that friendly face back
*22:48.900- 22:54.600* :  on the street and it's amazing what a really friendly person in a blue vest can do tear.
*22:54.940- 22:59.660* :  You know if there's people around causing problems they will normally go the other way.
*23:00.360- 23:06.020* :  But I think the biggest thing for me is it's made young people feel safer and it's still allowing
*23:06.020- 23:11.780* :  them to have their independence. You must be so proud of this. I'm so passionate about my volunteers
*23:11.780- 23:17.380* :  and you know the time they give out they're such selfless people and yeah it's been a fantastic
*23:17.380- 23:23.260* :  thing to be involved in something like this should be in every community. You're someone who came
*23:23.260- 23:28.760* :  from halfway across the world to settle in London and yet somehow you've done things that a
*23:28.760- 23:33.660* :  lot of Londoners haven't been able to. You think it takes an outsider to come in and sort out an
*23:33.660- 23:38.120* :  issue that perhaps people don't know how to deal with when it's something they've grown up with?
*23:38.320- 23:43.580* :  Potentially it could just be my personality as well. Maybe I would have done this in New Zealand,
*23:44.580- 23:49.240* :  maybe I wouldn't know that so hard to tell I've been here 20 years now but I do seem to be
*23:49.240- 23:55.680* :  someone that can look at a problem and come up with a solution to solve it. So I have a
*23:55.680- 24:02.200* :  my time been called a Disruptor on many occasions but I'd like to think that the work I do is from
*24:02.200- 24:08.120* :  a good place with good values and I am a true believer that when communities work together great
*24:08.120- 24:13.280* :  things can be achieved. Emma Rigby and if you have a story about someone who's brought your community
*24:13.280- 24:21.400* :  together we'd love to hear it email us at globalpodcastatbbc.co.uk. Art can be a source of happiness
*24:21.400- 24:26.380* :  for many of us and around the world Vincent Van Gogh is certainly among the most loved of all
*24:26.380- 24:31.220* :  painters. He's often remembered for the mental health struggles that led him to cut off his
*24:31.220- 24:36.540* :  own ear and later to take his own life but a new exhibition at the National Gallery in London
*24:36.540- 24:42.500* :  wants to remind us that his life contained happiness as well. Vincent Dowd went to see the show.
*24:45.460- 24:52.940* :  No Van Gogh exhibition would seek to disguise his sad end at the age of 37 but Van Gogh poets and
*24:52.940- 25:00.560* :  lovers focuses on the last two years of his life to show there were moments of joy as well even in
*25:00.560- 25:06.680* :  his time at the San Remy asylum in Provence in the south of France where he went seeking the
*25:06.680- 25:14.620* :  mental balance he knew he lacked. Christopher Riapel is the co-curator. He is exploring nature
*25:14.620- 25:21.960* :  and exploring friendship with such inventiveness. The vast majority of Vincent's career is euphoric.
*25:21.960- 25:27.480* :  With our tales of Warbegon Vincent we missed the fact this was a man in control of his own life.
*25:27.660- 25:33.800* :  This image shows the hospital at San Remy but look how he transforms the garden we have photographs
*25:33.800- 25:40.540* :  of. Those trees aren't there. He is inventing this wonderful space where these trees take on
*25:40.560- 25:46.820* :  they're almost like giants dancing. Very colorful particularly the range of greens and the way they
*25:46.820- 25:53.080* :  play into the blues is really wonderful but we notice in the lower left corner a woman with a
*25:53.080- 26:00.260* :  beautiful parasol overhead which is just a slash of bright red to animate the picture. Chris we've
*26:00.260- 26:07.800* :  come into a different room where the big centerpiece is the two images of sunflowers hugely famous
*26:07.800- 26:13.680* :  in terms of vangoff. A bit of a cue to get two images. It is indeed this is the first time that
*26:13.700- 26:21.520* :  the Philadelphia Museum of Arts great sunflowers has left the museum. Why was Vincent obsessed with
*26:21.520- 26:28.600* :  sunflowers? There are a number of reasons he saw a lot of symbolism in the sun, life, blooming etc.
*26:28.940- 26:36.580* :  They have so much sunlight they kind of create a feeling of sun in us. You're blasted by sunshine looking
*26:36.580- 26:42.280* :  at them but you're also again so drawn to the physicality of the way he paints those things
*26:42.280- 26:49.640* :  big thick strokes of color that stand proud on the canvas. Here in the next room three pictures
*26:50.280- 26:56.420* :  clearly from San Remy. Are there different locations? It's quite I'm not sure. That is a
*26:56.420- 27:02.820* :  surprising thing. He's in his house looking out a window at the exact same site, same little
*27:02.820- 27:08.220* :  house in the distance, same hills beyond and yet you would really have to stand here for 10 minutes
*27:08.220- 27:14.120* :  on your own to figure that out but each one transformed in terms of color in terms of angle
*27:14.300- 27:19.960* :  clouds that have their seem to have their own independent life. There are different emotions
*27:19.960- 27:26.260* :  he's playing with as well as as different perspectives. Did he change his color palette in the
*27:26.260- 27:32.420* :  relatively short time he was in San Remy? The palette just gets brighter and brighter and
*27:32.960- 27:39.020* :  purer. I mean more and more you see just pure colors laid down on the canvas with incredible
*27:39.020- 27:44.900* :  vivacity. He always thought it realized he could do great things with yellow and one of the things
*27:44.900- 27:51.900* :  we see in this exhibition is how wonderful he is with white. White really makes the surface dance.
*27:52.760- 27:59.180* :  What do you suspect Vincent most liked painting? He loved being confronted by people and there is
*27:59.180- 28:06.080* :  a certain joy in the portraits as well but it's much more of a sense of a face to face confrontation.
*28:06.080- 28:13.400* :  If we look at his take on human beings close up they're wonderfully detailed and there's often
*28:13.400- 28:19.020* :  a sort of spark to them and that that sense of a personal engagement is there. He loved people.
*28:19.020- 28:23.620* :  What are people going to learn from this exhibition Chris that they haven't learnt before? Vincent
*28:23.620- 28:29.760* :  was in control of his own career. He was plotting his own career how he and his friends were going
*28:29.760- 28:35.180* :  to make it as independent avant-garde artists in the world and yes he sold very few pictures
*28:35.180- 28:41.220* :  during his lifetime. 25 years after his death he was the most famous artist in the world so he
*28:41.220- 28:48.500* :  was doing something right. That report by Vincent Dowd on the joyous side of his namesake Van Gogh.
*28:49.420- 28:54.960* :  Now she may only be two months old but she's already amassed a vast fan base online in Asia
*28:54.960- 29:00.560* :  across Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. She's even got her own Wikipedia page as a result of her
*29:00.560- 29:07.660* :  growing fame. Time magazine has hailed her as an icon and a legend. Vanessa Heaney reports on this
*29:07.660- 29:13.880* :  latest internet sensation. With her stumpy little legs, podji body and gappy teeth,
*29:14.300- 29:19.920* :  she's not exactly the most obvious social media it girl. But Mue Deng which roughly translates
*29:19.920- 29:28.260* :  as bouncy pork is a huge internet star and a baby pig me hippo. When she was born two months
*29:28.260- 29:35.440* :  ago at the cow co open zoo in Thailand zookeeper Attenpon Nundi started posting videos of her.
*29:35.820- 29:41.560* :  He thought he'd make her famous in Thailand but never imagined how far her fame would spread.
*29:42.440- 29:47.160* :  Now videos of Mue Deng wobbling adorably around her enclosure have gone viral.
*29:47.400- 29:54.240* :  She has a fervent following of obsessed fans who monitor her every move. With one saying on X
*29:54.240- 29:59.460* :  they'd been thinking about this queen all day while another said they didn't know anything else
*29:59.460- 30:05.300* :  going on in the world right now except for Mue Deng. One makeup company in Thailand has even
*30:05.300- 30:11.400* :  started telling users to wear their blush to look like a baby hippo and cafes are producing cakes
*30:11.400- 30:16.900* :  in her likeness. Not surprisingly her fame has caused visitor numbers to double at the zoo
*30:16.900- 30:21.980* :  where she lives near the city of Pataya. And while some thoughtless people have thrown things to
*30:21.980- 30:26.960* :  try and wake her up for their photos, she's attracted adoring visitors from around the world
*30:26.960- 30:33.060* :  and even being welcomed by the Royal Thai Embassy which described her cute appearance as soothing.
*30:33.100- 30:38.860* :  Her birth is also good news for her endangered species native to West Africa. Attenpon
*30:38.860- 30:44.280* :  the zookeeper hopes that Mue Deng's cuteness will help raise awareness and encourage people to
*30:44.280- 30:51.500* :  learn more about them. Vanessa Heaney on the hip baby hippo Mue Deng and you can see pictures
*30:51.500- 30:56.120* :  of the happy hippo in all her wobbly cuteness on the BBC news website.
