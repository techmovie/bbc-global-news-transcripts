*01:44.420- 01:51.380* :  Ready meals, chocolate, biscuits, sausages, fizzy drinks. We know that processed food is bad for us.
*01:52.440- 01:56.940* :  But recent research shows that in many countries around the world, the majority of calories most
*01:56.940- 02:03.540* :  of us consume are from products known as ultra-processed foods. These foods are being blamed for an
*02:03.540- 02:10.260* :  increase in ill health, including heart attacks, strokes, obesity, type 2 diabetes and even anxiety.
*02:11.340- 02:16.540* :  So how harmful are ultra-processed foods for our health, and given how common they are,
*02:16.860- 02:18.440* :  is it even possible to avoid them?
*02:23.480- 02:27.920* :  With me today is BBC Health Correspondent, Philippa Roxby, and Ruth Alexander,
*02:27.920- 02:32.380* :  a presenter of the BBC programme The Food Chain. Good to have you both with us. Hi.
*02:32.500- 02:37.680* :  Thanks, hi, Lucy. Hello. Ruth, can we start with some basics? What exactly are ultra-process
*02:37.680- 02:41.260* :  foods? They're known by some as UPFs, but what are they?
*02:41.980- 02:48.520* :  Good question. I'm afraid there is no set definition, but in general, it refers to food that
*02:48.520- 02:55.200* :  contains ingredients that you wouldn't find in your home kitchen, food that's been industrially
*02:55.200- 03:00.820* :  made and formulated to behave in a way that it wouldn't, if it was at home with you. So ice cream
*03:00.820- 03:06.800* :  that doesn't melt, bread that takes days to go stale, it's often packaged, it's made for convenience,
*03:07.960- 03:15.280* :  often heavily marketed. Think of packaged snacks, sweets, biscuits, pastries, cakes,
*03:15.400- 03:22.860* :  pizzas, cereals, chicken nuggets, sausages, burgers, hot dogs, yoghurt, instant soups. I mean,
*03:22.860- 03:28.080* :  the list just goes on and on and on. Ruth, I'm now just mentally running through a checklist
*03:28.080- 03:32.760* :  of everything that's in my cupboards, in my fridge and freezer, and I'm a little bit worried
*03:33.400- 03:37.260* :  about what you're about to tell us. So I know you've also been going through your cupboards.
*03:37.260- 03:42.380* :  What have you found? Yeah, that's right. And actually, I mostly cook from scratch,
*03:42.380- 03:47.720* :  so I didn't think I would find much, but I found plenty whole meal bread, you know, the sliced
*03:47.720- 03:53.660* :  package variety that you find in supermarkets. Nutritionally good for you, but ultra-processed,
*03:53.940- 03:59.100* :  fish fingers, which I think of as a sort of quick but healthy dinner time thing, and I thought,
*03:59.100- 04:03.860* :  well, that can't be ultra-process, it's just fish and bread crumbs, isn't it? It was ultra-processed.
*04:04.220- 04:07.600* :  Mayonnaise. I'd had a little bit with my lunch when I was going around my kitchen checking
*04:07.640- 04:15.120* :  things. Ultra-processed. But the one that probably surprised me most of all was stock cubes. I looked
*04:15.140- 04:20.300* :  at them and they are ultra-processed. So that means that all those home cooked stews I did,
*04:20.780- 04:26.700* :  all that cooking from scratch I did actually was kind of undone by the fact that I put a
*04:27.000- 04:31.920* :  stock cube or two in that was ultra-processed. I mean, I think about fish fingers being the staple
*04:31.920- 04:36.820* :  for so many kids up and down the country here in the UK, but in the Western world as well. So many
*04:36.820- 04:41.760* :  people have them and wouldn't think that. What about Philippa cereal? So many kids start the day
*04:41.760- 04:47.220* :  with a bowl of cereal with some whole milk. Yeah, okay. Well, it can be depending on the type of cereal
*04:47.220- 04:51.500* :  you choose. There's a lot of cereals that are sweetened, so lots of sugar is added to them,
*04:51.560- 04:55.680* :  and actually you've got some here. They look a little bit chocolatey. There's definitely added
*04:55.680- 05:00.980* :  sugar in there, but then there's a lot of cereals that are whole green and have fiber in them,
*05:01.380- 05:06.260* :  and are good for you. So this is the slight issue with the definition of ultra-processed foods
*05:06.820- 05:11.660* :  is that you tend to think that everything you're in your cupboard cannot be eaten, but actually
*05:11.660- 05:16.680* :  there are some that do contain the good stuff you need and it's just sorting good ones out from
*05:16.680- 05:20.600* :  the bad ones. I mean, I think one of the things with cereal is that their marketer is being healthy
*05:20.600- 05:25.220* :  for you and a really good start to the day, particularly for kids. And this is where scientists are
*05:25.220- 05:29.840* :  really concerned out there because they say actually they're the driving force behind multiple
*05:29.840- 05:33.720* :  diet related illnesses can be and something as simple as your breakfast cereal.
*05:34.200- 05:37.040* :  Yeah, that's right. I mean, there's evidence that the majority of children's diets,
*05:37.040- 05:41.000* :  particularly in the Western world, are made up of ultra-processed foods, so everything from,
*05:41.400- 05:45.020* :  you know, the bread they eat to the cereals to maybe the drinks they have at breakfast.
*05:45.900- 05:50.000* :  And that's a real worry because these kids are growing up and what will this do to their health
*05:50.420- 05:55.840* :  later on? I mean, there's lots of research growing evidence that ultra-process foods aren't particularly
*05:56.520- 06:02.020* :  good for us, but scientists are still not sure exactly what it is about those foods that's
*06:02.020- 06:06.880* :  causing the problem. Is it the way they're made, the way they're processed, or is it the fact that
*06:06.880- 06:11.500* :  they just contain lots of sugar and lots of fat, as we can see here. I mean, we've got a table
*06:11.500- 06:18.100* :  in front of us full of ultra-processed foods and just looking at them, some you could say they're
*06:18.100- 06:24.920* :  high in saturated fats, salt, sugar, but there's some pretty innocent looking bread there as well.
*06:24.920- 06:29.160* :  What's wrong with that? Well, that's right. I mean, bread comes in all different shapes and
*06:29.160- 06:34.660* :  sizes. I guess you could say these might be burger rolls. I suppose they're white, so they're
*06:34.660- 06:39.700* :  definitely not full of fiber, probably not whole grain. So nutritionists would say if you're going
*06:39.700- 06:45.500* :  to go for a certain type of bread, go for the whole grain variety. I guess these are processed to last
*06:46.280- 06:51.920* :  longer. They look like sort of long life rolls, so you want them to stay okay in your
*06:51.920- 06:56.960* :  recovery so you can eat them for several days, and that's why in the food industry, they do
*06:56.960- 07:01.660* :  process things to preserve them and keep them for longer. So some reasons why processing is a good
*07:01.660- 07:06.320* :  thing, there are other reasons why processing might not be such a good thing, and that's what scientists
*07:06.320- 07:10.540* :  are trying to work out. Yeah, and I see Ruth that scientists have done a big review, the largest
*07:10.540- 07:15.240* :  review of some of the evidence today, and they say there are 32 harmful health effects
*07:15.760- 07:21.800* :  from some of these foods that are out there. But looking at the table in front of us,
*07:21.800- 07:26.660* :  even thinking about what's in our cupboards, is there any nutritional value, or is there
*07:26.660- 07:30.940* :  some hope there with some of these foods Ruth? Well, that's a thing, and as Philip was saying,
*07:30.940- 07:38.560* :  it's not known why ultra-process food might be causing harm, and it could be that there are
*07:38.560- 07:43.380* :  some foods that are ultra-process that are absolutely fine for you. I mean, there's another category
*07:43.380- 07:48.460* :  that's just down from ultra-process, which is processed food, and that's not being criticised,
*07:48.720- 07:52.540* :  but when I was looking in my cupboards, the dark chocolate that I would like to say is an
*07:52.540- 07:57.240* :  occasional treat, actually it's probably quite a frequent treat if I'm honest, that was processed,
*07:57.240- 08:03.340* :  not ultra-processed. Is it good for me? In the quantities I eat it, I'm not so sure. Also,
*08:03.340- 08:09.840* :  potato crisps, another of my weaknesses, is another good one to look at, because if they've got
*08:09.840- 08:15.720* :  added flavour, they tend to be ultra-processed, but the plain salted varieties are not considered
*08:15.720- 08:21.640* :  ultra-processed. Are they good for me? Well, they're full of saturated fat and have high levels of
*08:21.640- 08:27.420* :  salt, probably not, actually, so it's not clear-cuts. Ruth, you and I share these guilty pleasures.
*08:27.420- 08:32.340* :  I also love crisps, I have to say, as well as dark chocolate. But does this mean, Philip,
*08:32.340- 08:37.280* :  that we have to get into the habit of looking at labels? It's not something I often do, but I suppose
*08:37.440- 08:42.200* :  it's time, isn't it? It's always a good idea, because if you turn around and you look at the
*08:42.200- 08:48.440* :  ingredients, you can see just how many are contained within a certain item. And a good rule of thumb
*08:48.440- 08:53.980* :  is if there's more than five, and most of them are unpronounceable, you know, they're huge long
*08:53.980- 09:00.840* :  names that end with an O, and perhaps even a number, or the letter E, they might be additives,
*09:01.240- 09:05.360* :  they might be flavourings, they might be colourings. So it's a good rule of thumb to think, well,
*09:05.360- 09:09.900* :  if there's loads of these additives in this food, is it really going to be a good thing for me?
*09:09.900- 09:14.500* :  And do I need it? So maybe look for something that's got fewer ingredients and less of the sort of
*09:14.500- 09:18.960* :  additives in them. So that's one way, good way of thinking about it. Quite often on packaging,
*09:18.960- 09:23.760* :  there's a sort of traffic label system, certainly in some parts of the world that shows you how much
*09:23.760- 09:31.420* :  fat is in a product, how much sugar, and how much salt. And again, that's a really good way of thinking,
*09:31.420- 09:35.600* :  is this going to be good for me or not? Well, you've already mentioned those words around the
*09:35.600- 09:40.360* :  world, surely the picture is different, depending on which country we're talking about. And I know in
*09:40.360- 09:45.060* :  2010, a group of Brazilian scientists said we should be focusing less on the nutritional content of
*09:45.060- 09:52.400* :  food and more on the form of processing it undergoes. And they created this nova classification,
*09:52.400- 09:58.300* :  which categorises foods based on how processed they are. And Ruth, I know you've spoken to one of
*09:58.300- 10:03.280* :  the scientists who came up with that system, Professor Jean-Claude Mulbaric from the University of
*10:03.280- 10:08.360* :  Montreal and Canada. It has a huge impact in changing how people think about food. The most
*10:08.360- 10:15.020* :  important thing we've done is to change the mind of the people from nutrients to practices. So
*10:15.400- 10:22.460* :  before nova, people were talking about fiber, about sugar, about salt. With nova, we talk about
*10:22.460- 10:30.840* :  why we process food and why we use such additive versus natural substances. It's a change in the way
*10:30.840- 10:36.800* :  people think about food. And we're getting also an impact on policies, but it's something that
*10:36.800- 10:42.840* :  it's a little slower to obtain because there's a lot of resistance in the market from companies
*10:42.840- 10:47.960* :  that are producing those ultra-process food. So Ruth, you've been speaking to these scientists at
*10:47.960- 10:53.620* :  the University of Montreal. Did they give you an idea of just how common new PFs are and how
*10:53.620- 10:58.260* :  difficult and tricky it is to avoid them? They did. I actually asked for some examples of
*10:58.260- 11:03.960* :  ultra-process food, and after about a minute of different foods being listed, I realised it would
*11:03.960- 11:09.660* :  have been much simpler to ask what isn't ultra-processed. The sales of this type of food are actually
*11:09.660- 11:13.780* :  thought to be increasing around the world, particularly in middle-income countries, where the
*11:13.780- 11:20.060* :  sales are rising and then in richer countries, they're already pretty high. I mean, you know yourself
*11:20.060- 11:26.040* :  if you go to the shops, actually. You've got the fruit and veg aisle, and then beyond that there,
*11:26.040- 11:31.540* :  I just, many, many shelves, with lots of different packaged goods. And if you look at the ingredients
*11:31.540- 11:36.760* :  on the back, it's often a long, long list of ingredients. So there is a fair amount of ultra-process
*11:36.760- 11:41.620* :  food out there. And apparently the people who tend to be the ones eating the highest amounts
*11:41.620- 11:48.260* :  tend to be younger, people who live in cities, often single people. So, you know, as we know, it's
*11:48.260- 11:52.340* :  convenient to get something out of the packet. Particularly when everyone's so busy at the moment,
*11:52.340- 11:57.640* :  and this fast pace world that we live in, Philip, how much harder is it if you've got a health
*11:57.700- 12:02.420* :  or dietary issue, which means that you have to have these foods? I know I have a son who has
*12:02.420- 12:09.400* :  celiac, and a lot of what I go to buy seems to have a lot of UPFs in it. And it's because it doesn't
*12:09.400- 12:13.420* :  necessarily have the ingredients in it to make the foods stick together, or to a last a long time,
*12:13.420- 12:16.920* :  or it has a lot of sugar in it to make it taste good. There aren't many other options.
*12:17.200- 12:21.620* :  Yeah, that's true. I mean, a lot of people do rely on ultra-processed foods for their
*12:21.620- 12:27.520* :  dietary needs, celiacs, for example, have to avoid foods that have gluten in them. So, if you go
*12:27.520- 12:31.980* :  to that particular aisle in the supermarket, you're going to find things that are processed because
*12:31.980- 12:36.820* :  they need to avoid that ingredient and replace it with something else. These products don't necessarily
*12:36.820- 12:43.060* :  look like the original raw food, and so they would count as ultra-processed. And then there's
*12:43.060- 12:49.460* :  things like baby formula milk. That would count as ultra-processed under this classification system,
*12:49.460- 12:54.020* :  and yet it's something that's used worldwide by moms trying to feed their babies,
*12:54.640- 12:59.700* :  and it comes from cow's milk. But it's had other things added to make it healthy for babies.
*12:59.700- 13:05.300* :  There's also vegan foods, plant-based foods. They would also count as ultra-processed,
*13:05.640- 13:10.900* :  and yet there's seen as very healthy alternatives to meat. So, it's a little bit confusing. There are
*13:10.900- 13:16.660* :  lots of people who can't necessarily avoid ultra-processed foods in the shops. That sounds really tricky
*13:16.660- 13:23.160* :  Ruth, because we are seeing a bit of an explosion in people who have chosen to have a vegan diet or
*13:23.160- 13:29.500* :  a plant-based diet as well. And from what we've been talking about, really hard for them to avoid
*13:29.500- 13:34.000* :  UPFs, they might not even know that the food they're eating has UPFs in them. Yes, if you're
*13:34.000- 13:38.620* :  drinking oat milk, for example, if you look at the ingredients there, it'll be full of
*13:38.780- 13:45.700* :  emulsifiers and texturises and other things like that. But I must say, I spoke to Jean-Claude
*13:45.700- 13:53.500* :  Mubarak about the issue of, for example, infant formula and gluten-free foods and said, well,
*13:53.500- 13:59.660* :  you know, they're ultra-processed under this nova classification system, but people rely on those
*13:59.660- 14:05.540* :  for health reasons. And he agreed and said, actually, I view infant formula, for example, as medicine,
*14:05.540- 14:10.920* :  not as food, but medicine. When we talk about celiac disease or, you know, this case of milk formula,
*14:11.680- 14:18.000* :  to me, these are miracles that saves lives, but I see this as medicine. When you cannot give
*14:18.580- 14:24.200* :  breastfed milk to your kid, then you need an alternative. And what we have is milk formula,
*14:24.200- 14:31.360* :  which is the next best thing we have. But to me, it's a medication. So, he wouldn't want people
*14:31.360- 14:36.480* :  to be overly anxious about what ultra-processed products they're buying when they're buying them
*14:36.560- 14:41.960* :  for a very good health reason. As with many things with diet, it's often about balance.
*14:43.000- 14:48.400* :  So, we've looked at what UPFs are and why they can harm your health. Next, the ways you can avoid
*14:48.400- 14:51.120* :  UPFs and what we don't yet know about them.
*14:57.960- 15:01.680* :  Hey, Pride members. Are you tired of ads interfering with your favorite podcasts?

*15:37.120- 15:41.080* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t.
*15:41.360- 15:46.660* :  So, to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*15:46.740- 15:51.040* :  Give it a try at midmobile.com slash switch. $45 upfront for three months plus taxes and fees,
*15:51.040- 15:53.420* :  promoting for new customers for limited time. Unlimited more than 40 gigabytes per month,

*16:03.300- 16:08.440* :  This is the global story. We bring you one big international story in detail five days a week.
*16:08.440- 16:13.440* :  Follow or subscribe wherever you listen. I'm speaking to Ruth Alexander and Philippa
*16:13.440- 16:19.340* :  Roxby about ultra-process foods. So, the big question for both of you is how can we avoid
*16:19.340- 16:24.300* :  UPS? It's pretty tricky because one of the messages is that we should be cooking from scratch
*16:24.300- 16:28.980* :  and cooking at home and our own kitchens with food that we know where it's come from, but
*16:29.300- 16:32.020* :  this is a really time consuming at the end of a long day.
*16:32.500- 16:36.820* :  Yeah, I mean, it's very difficult as we discuss to avoid every single ultra-process food. It's
*16:36.820- 16:43.340* :  extremely difficult. And if you're a busy working parent, it's much easier. Let's face it,
*16:43.540- 16:47.940* :  to reach for something that's ready, ready made, ready to go in the oven, ready to go in the
*16:47.940- 16:53.420* :  microwave. It's quite often cheaper, too. And in these constrained times when we're all thinking
*16:53.420- 16:58.740* :  about how much money we've got in our pockets, that is an easier option. But I think experts would
*16:58.740- 17:04.020* :  say don't throw everything out of your cupboard, then don't go mad feeling guilty about everything
*17:04.020- 17:10.480* :  you use that comes from a jar. But the messages always have more fresh vegetables and fresh fruit
*17:10.480- 17:17.240* :  in your diet and fish and lean meat and whole grains. Just think of getting that balance in your
*17:17.320- 17:21.100* :  in your diet. I think a lot of people might understand that, but some of those straightforward
*17:21.100- 17:26.320* :  things, like fresh fruit and vegetables, grains, lean meat and fish, it is expensive.
*17:26.860- 17:31.980* :  Philipo, these Brazilian scientists only came up with the term UPF back in 2010. That wasn't that
*17:31.980- 17:37.180* :  long ago. So how much more is there to find out about the impact that UPFs have on our health?
*17:37.500- 17:42.240* :  There's quite a long way to go. Scientists are trying to work in the lab and look at the effects
*17:42.240- 17:47.240* :  of things like additives and emulsifiers, which we find in ultra-processors. They're trying to
*17:47.240- 17:52.680* :  look at those in the lab and find out if there might be an impact on our guts. And so far they think
*17:52.680- 17:58.680* :  there might be, but then they need to move on to doing that in big human studies, studies of
*17:58.680- 18:04.520* :  lots of different people. And at the moment, the research we have is based on great big observational
*18:04.520- 18:09.000* :  studies, which means that you're really relying on somebody filling in a questionnaire about what
*18:09.000- 18:14.380* :  they've eaten in a couple of months ago. And so they're not particularly reliable studies. All
*18:14.380- 18:19.980* :  they can do is say that we think these ultra-process foods that these people have eaten are linked to
*18:20.420- 18:25.080* :  poor health later on, maybe heart attacks and cardiovascular disease. But what these studies
*18:25.080- 18:30.680* :  don't show is that that ultra-process food caused that heart attack. And so maybe in the meantime,
*18:30.680- 18:35.380* :  lots of nutritionists say, just go back to thinking about how much fat, how much sugar, how many
*18:35.380- 18:39.480* :  calories are in the things we're eating. Ruth, I was in the supermarket recently, and it's the first
*18:39.480- 18:43.800* :  time I've noticed this, that people have been standing in arms with their phones out and scanning
*18:43.800- 18:50.520* :  food. What kind of tech is out there to help us identify what's in the food that we're buying and
*18:50.520- 18:56.200* :  what UPF's are there? Yes, you can find these apps, which will tell you this is ultra-processed,
*18:56.200- 19:01.940* :  and also what the nutritional value of the food is. I used one in my kitchen. It was called
*19:01.940- 19:08.680* :  Open Food Facts, and that's actually a French-based non-profit organisation set up 10 years ago.
*19:09.240- 19:14.240* :  And I must say they're sort of like, once you get going on it, you know, I had to make a conscious
*19:14.240- 19:21.100* :  decision to okay, close the cupboards, put my phone down, just start this. What you do is you scan
*19:21.100- 19:27.500* :  the barcodes and it will come up and you yourself can add products in. So users have taken pictures
*19:27.660- 19:33.660* :  and added the ingredients in, so it's this sort of big database made up of products that people
*19:33.660- 19:38.400* :  have found on the shelves or in their kitchen all around the world. But this one has a traffic light
*19:38.400- 19:43.640* :  system where you're looking at, you know, green, the nutritionally good, red if it's ultra-processed.
*19:44.000- 19:49.160* :  But as we've been saying, actually it's not clear cut really, and I spoke to the founder of
*19:49.160- 19:54.680* :  that app, and he agreed that actually it is a confusing picture. You know, perfect word,
*19:54.680- 20:00.480* :  basically food would be clearly labeled front of back, so you would have clear warnings about
*20:00.480- 20:07.700* :  ultra-processed. And that's the final eventual point of those apps. It's not basically keeping
*20:07.700- 20:13.200* :  people captive to scanning products. It's basically changing the formulas of the food offer,
*20:13.580- 20:19.400* :  so that everyone benefits and that their systemic change in what we buy in the supermarket,
*20:19.400- 20:25.900* :  that the default choice in the supermarket becomes the right choices. We believe that if we
*20:25.900- 20:31.780* :  mobilize, if we team up together, we can force the industry to actually listen to the public,
*20:31.780- 20:37.860* :  listen to the governments and it changes the balance of power between the food industry and the
*20:37.860- 20:42.780* :  general public. I was on a family holiday recently and we got the kids to do all the scanning of
*20:42.780- 20:47.520* :  the food, which they thought was great fun. Any excuse to use the phone, I don't think they mind,
*20:47.520- 20:51.320* :  as long as they've got the phone in their hands, they're happy, but it is quite a lot of effort
*20:51.860- 20:56.700* :  to scan a product like this. And Chile has an interesting example of what their government is doing
*20:56.700- 21:00.540* :  about UPF's booth. Tell us what they did to tackle high obesity rates.
*21:01.160- 21:05.800* :  Yes, a few years ago, they brought in a system where they have black labels on packaging,
*21:05.800- 21:13.940* :  which if it's high in sugar or in fat, for example, with the idea of bringing down obesity rates,
*21:14.580- 21:20.220* :  looking into the statistics, it's not clear that it has actually had a great effect on those
*21:20.260- 21:24.680* :  rates, but we did speak to people in Chile about whether they found those labels useful,
*21:25.060- 21:29.440* :  while they know what to do and they know to avoid the black labels and they know to avoid
*21:29.440- 21:34.420* :  ultra-process food. Actually, sometimes life just gets in the way. We really try to avoid that,
*21:34.540- 21:39.680* :  but anyway, when we're in the hurry, I think we just speak the things that we know already
*21:40.040- 21:46.200* :  and they think that we like. There's also all the tasty food and all the nice food that
*21:47.020- 21:52.540* :  the normally the kids like is like full of labels and sugar and all that things.
*21:53.220- 22:00.200* :  So even you try to avoid it, it's easier to buy and most of the people we buy that kind of food
*22:00.200- 22:07.360* :  because it's cheaper. A lot of this food is targeted at children, so sweets and candies.
*22:07.360- 22:13.300* :  When ice cream is a commonly ultra-processed food. And it is worrying when you think of childhood
*22:13.300- 22:17.640* :  obesity rates, such a creeping up in lots of countries in the world. If we don't follow
*22:17.640- 22:23.120* :  if I get on top of UPS, what's going to happen in the long term? Yeah, I suppose it's quite depressing
*22:23.120- 22:28.840* :  really to think that obesity rates could rise even more. As you see, countries are already struggling
*22:28.840- 22:34.800* :  to try and make sure that children grow up eating the right things and are not overweight by the
*22:34.800- 22:41.360* :  time they reach school or even start secondary school. And this type of food is so freely available
*22:41.360- 22:47.100* :  and it's cheap and it's very morish. And of course, lots of people say that it slips down very
*22:47.100- 22:53.220* :  easily and it means that you want more very soon afterwards, so potentially you eat more of that
*22:53.220- 22:59.200* :  type of stuff. And if children grow up used to eating that way, that will continue into adulthood.
*22:59.900- 23:04.620* :  But I think scientists have still got a job to do to find out more evidence about whether
*23:04.620- 23:10.180* :  it's the processing that's to blame or whether it's the ingredients. And then also I suppose we
*23:10.180- 23:16.340* :  all need to think about how we can help people choose more of the right kinds of foods
*23:16.620- 23:20.880* :  unless of the wrong kinds of foods, but it's a big challenge. Yeah, education is obviously key
*23:20.880- 23:26.260* :  with this, Ruth. Yes, and probably the thing to do is to start with a small realistic step as well.
*23:26.260- 23:29.680* :  If you're listening to this and thinking, you know, what I would like to reduce the amount
*23:29.680- 23:36.740* :  of ultra-process food I'm eating, perhaps it's just making one meal in the week from scratch.
*23:37.480- 23:43.040* :  If you're vegan and you're relying on, you know, plant-based meat subsistutes, which are often
*23:43.040- 23:49.840* :  ultra-process, think about substituting that with lentils and beans, which can bulk out the dish.
*23:50.300- 23:55.320* :  I think what also we might, you know, lose if ultra-process food continues to be as popular as it is,
*23:55.640- 24:00.620* :  is the joy of home cooking. I mean, many of us are so busy that it is hard to fit that in,
*24:00.960- 24:05.980* :  but, you know, if you can sort of find a simple recipe that, you know, worked one day a week,
*24:05.980- 24:11.160* :  maybe build up from there. Easier said than done, I know, though. Ruth, it would be lovely if you
*24:11.160- 24:15.340* :  were here with us, but maybe it's best that you're not, because given our weakness for crisps,
*24:15.500- 24:20.180* :  I've got some in the table in front of me, it's going to take every bit of my willpower not to
*24:20.180- 24:24.520* :  polish them off, but it's been lovely to have you with us. Thanks so much. Thank you very much,
*24:24.520- 24:29.960* :  and yeah, I'm pleased to have avoided that bug of crisps. Can we resist my offer? No,
