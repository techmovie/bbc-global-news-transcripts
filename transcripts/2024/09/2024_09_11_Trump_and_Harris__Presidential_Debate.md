*01:34.020- 01:38.100* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 11th of September, these are our main
*01:38.100- 01:42.920* :  stories. Kamala Harris has accused Donald Trump of having a real problem with the truth,
*01:43.400- 01:47.320* :  ahead of the televised debate between the two US presidential candidates.
*01:48.140- 01:53.060* :  Western nations have imposed new sanctions on Iran for supplying a Russia with ballistic missiles
*01:53.060- 01:59.600* :  to use against Ukraine. 26 people are confirmed dead and dozens more are missing after a boat
*01:59.600- 02:02.940* :  carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Senegal.
*02:05.660- 02:11.060* :  Also in this podcast. In girls, it's all over the brain. Both hemispheres, all lobes,
*02:11.540- 02:14.240* :  but most of the areas have to do with social processing.
*02:14.840- 02:19.940* :  We hear about the staggering impact that living through the COVID pandemic had on girls' brains.
*02:24.100- 02:28.440* :  As we record this podcast, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are preparing for their much
*02:28.440- 02:34.380* :  publicized live televised presidential debate in Philadelphia. In a race that is effectively a
*02:34.380- 02:38.800* :  tie at the moment, it's a fitting place for the debate. It's in the state of Pennsylvania,
*02:38.800- 02:43.980* :  which is one of a handful of swing states that will determine the outcome of the election.
*02:44.580- 02:49.920* :  Aaron Karl is a presidential debate expert from the University of Michigan. He says more than
*02:49.920- 02:53.320* :  50 million Americans will tune into the 90-minute showdown.
*02:53.680- 02:59.560* :  There's no other event in the campaign, speeches, press conferences, the conventions that will
*02:59.560- 03:04.620* :  gather anywhere near this number, this audience of tens of millions, approaching superbowl like
*03:04.620- 03:09.960* :  ratings, one night, one opportunity for both to reach so many people.
*03:10.500- 03:12.840* :  Among the millions watching, these voters in Philadelphia.
*03:13.540- 03:20.600* :  Vice President Harris really think this is her chance to get her message out, to get her
*03:20.640- 03:23.800* :  personality out there, really to find out what her policies are.
*03:23.900- 03:29.720* :  I'm interested to hear what both individuals have to say. I haven't swayed who I'm putting
*03:29.720- 03:34.640* :  the vote for. I don't want to convict the felon as the president, so there you go.
*03:35.360- 03:38.060* :  Also in Philadelphia, our correspondent, Netta Tulfik.
*03:38.380- 03:44.620* :  Kamala Harris said she's preparing for Donald Trump to tell a lot of untruths for him to go
*03:44.620- 03:51.060* :  low and that she just wants to remind the American people in her words that he is somebody who is
*03:51.060- 03:57.000* :  for himself and not for the country. And so I think she knows she has to do a number of things
*03:57.000- 04:02.820* :  at this debate, which is by the way, the first time she will meet Donald Trump face to face in
*04:02.820- 04:08.300* :  the same room. She knows she has to introduce herself to voters because polling shows that there
*04:08.300- 04:13.960* :  are a number across America who still feel they don't know her that well or her policies,
*04:13.960- 04:17.800* :  because even though she's been the vice president, it's of course been in support of
*04:18.280- 04:23.760* :  President Biden's agenda. They want to know what she is about. She also needs to outline her
*04:23.760- 04:30.200* :  policies and she has said she wants to focus on policy over personality. She wants to make sure she
*04:30.200- 04:36.280* :  outlines what has really been a move to the middle for her on a number of things. She wants to
*04:36.280- 04:41.560* :  really focus on the economy with the inflation inflation so high that of course something that
*04:42.020- 04:47.700* :  as being part of the incumbent party, she has worried people will put on her. But also she wants
*04:47.700- 04:53.680* :  people to focus on Donald Trump. Again, this idea that freedom is at stake here that she wants to
*04:53.680- 04:58.140* :  move the country forward and her message that he wants to take the country back, including on
*04:58.140- 05:04.040* :  things like abortion. And Netta, what will Donald Trump's advisors have been telling him to focus on?
*05:04.940- 05:10.040* :  Well, look, his advisors think that his kind of greatest strength is his unpredictability.
*05:10.040- 05:16.540* :  They say that Kamala Harris might struggle to really take him on on the debate stage. I mean,
*05:16.900- 05:20.300* :  Kamala Harris's team would push back on that saying she's a former federal prosecutor,
*05:20.300- 05:24.840* :  but Donald Trump has done seven debates. He has a history of knowing how to kind of
*05:24.840- 05:31.220* :  goad his opponent while appearing confident. His team says that they want to make sure that he
*05:31.220- 05:37.960* :  hammers home the point that all of Joe Biden's policies are Kamala Harris's policies as well.
*05:38.120- 05:43.940* :  And they want to paint her as somebody who is radically to the left. So that's certainly going
*05:43.940- 05:49.920* :  to be his strategy. But look, I think if we look back at his original debate with Joe Biden, 75
*05:49.920- 05:56.080* :  days ago, which obviously ended disastrously for Joe Biden and him leaving the race, Donald Trump
*05:56.080- 06:02.860* :  showed a lot of composure. It didn't let himself kind of get rattled. Many are questioning whether
*06:02.860- 06:08.260* :  he'll be able to do the same this time around. Nettaurfic, my colleague Evan Davis spoke to the
*06:08.260- 06:13.940* :  Republican strategist and debate coach Brett O'Donnell, who's prepared many presidential candidates
*06:13.940- 06:20.440* :  for televised clashes from George W. Bush and Mitt Romney to Ron DeSantis. First, what advice would
*06:20.440- 06:28.020* :  he give to Kamala Harris? Donald Trump has a thin skin. I would go after him at a personal level,
*06:28.540- 06:35.140* :  talk about things that might irritate him and try to get him angry and have an outburst on the
*06:35.140- 06:41.300* :  stage. That would make me look good. So for Kamala Harris, it's all about focusing on personality
*06:41.300- 06:49.360* :  and persona and trying to contrast like ability as opposed to getting bogged down in policy.
*06:49.760- 06:56.540* :  The problem with that, though, is the American public are hurting from an economy that's been
*06:56.540- 07:03.040* :  bad for almost four years. And they are looking for someone who will lead them out of this and has a
*07:03.040- 07:11.700* :  plan to do so. So she may do that at the expense of really giving a vision for where she'd take
*07:11.700- 07:16.680* :  the country. And as Donald Trump said the other night in a town hall, you might not like me,
*07:17.160- 07:21.960* :  but you should vote for me because I'd be a better president. So I think that's probably going to
*07:21.960- 07:27.020* :  be his argument. Okay, what would your advice be to him about how to play it tonight? Just the
*07:27.020- 07:35.320* :  opposite of Kamala Harris. It would be stay focused on policy. Make her own her record. In fact,
*07:35.320- 07:42.580* :  she does own the last three and a half years. Don't let her get away with looking like a challenger
*07:42.580- 07:50.420* :  or a change agent. And then write the following words, dangerously liberal and failed and weak
*07:50.420- 07:57.400* :  at the top of his page. And everything he says should point toward those four words.
*07:57.720- 08:00.780* :  Well, it's interesting you say that I think they're not being allowed to take notes in today.
*08:00.780- 08:05.320* :  So he won't be able to learn the words off by heart, I think, if I'm not mistaken in terms of
*08:05.320- 08:09.560* :  the rules. Sure, sure. But when he walks out on stage, write those at the top of the page.
*08:10.400- 08:17.620* :  And and then connect with the audience underneath of it and do everything in his power to go after
*08:17.620- 08:24.620* :  her. He's got to make this election a referendum on her and the status quo. Now you have been there
*08:24.620- 08:28.860* :  coaching candidates on these debates. I don't think you've coached Trump himself.
*08:29.840- 08:35.420* :  Might not. My guess is though, he would be a difficult one to coach. I mean, he's an unguided
*08:35.420- 08:40.580* :  missile. I mean, you can tell him focus on this focus on that. Use these words. But I don't know,
*08:40.580- 08:45.980* :  would he would he listen to what you say? Do you think? I don't know. I've never been given that
*08:45.980- 08:52.460* :  opportunity. But here's the one thing I do know. He's done a ton of interviews. And and there's
*08:52.460- 08:57.540* :  no substitute for being in the bright lights. And I think that's a disadvantage for Kamala Harris.
*08:57.540- 09:05.140* :  My guess is right now deep down. She's probably regretting not doing more interviews because that
*09:05.140- 09:11.040* :  gives you a chance to try out answers to get used and comfortable to being peppered with questions
*09:11.340- 09:16.100* :  from the press rather than your staff. We'll see what happens. You know, in the in the first
*09:16.100- 09:22.600* :  debate between Biden and Trump and June, he was very disciplined in that first 30 to 40 minutes,
*09:22.600- 09:28.920* :  which is when you win and lose these things. And so we'll see what kind of performance he turns in
*09:28.920- 09:34.900* :  tonight. Brett O'Donnell and you can watch the debate on the BBC news channel. Well, as we heard
*09:34.900- 09:40.260* :  there, one of the most important issues nationally in the US election and one that's actually on the
*09:40.260- 09:47.020* :  ballot in many states in November is the question of access to abortion in 2022 when the US Supreme
*09:47.020- 09:52.700* :  Court overturned its landmark Roe versus Wade ruling that protected a woman's right to an abortion.
*09:52.700- 09:59.020* :  Missouri became the first state to implement a near blanket ban on the procedure. The only exception
*09:59.020- 10:04.060* :  being cases where the mother's life is in danger. Women have to travel to abortion clinics
*10:04.220- 10:10.380* :  outside the state as James Menendez reports. It was heart-wrenching. My world crumbled that day.
*10:10.720- 10:16.140* :  That's Erica who lives on the other side of the state in the confusingly named Kansas City.
*10:16.660- 10:21.400* :  A year and a half ago, she was given the news that no mother to be wants to hear.
*10:22.280- 10:29.620* :  I had a very wanted pregnancy when my doctor came in and told me my son who we named
*10:29.620- 10:38.940* :  Easton had fetal anomaly and she went on to share what it meant if he survived and so for us,
*10:39.280- 10:45.620* :  thinking about our living child, Easton and his quality of life, our marriage, we did make the
*10:45.620- 10:53.640* :  choiceless choice to seek an abortion. And compounding that that horrible situation was the fact
*10:53.640- 11:00.060* :  that Missouri has an almost total ban on abortions. Were there big questions about how you were
*11:00.060- 11:05.740* :  going to get the treatment, the abortion you needed? So when I got to maternal fetal medicine and
*11:05.740- 11:14.040* :  they ran the additional tests, she told me where I could go and it was a 10-hour car ride to Denver
*11:14.040- 11:22.240* :  Colorado or a airplane to Washington DC. There are those on the other side of the argument who
*11:22.240- 11:27.640* :  believe the sanctity of the fetus' life is the most important thing. What do you say to them?
*11:28.220- 11:36.280* :  Our decision was made out of immense motherly love and fatherly love. I did not want my child to
*11:36.280- 11:42.600* :  suffer. Yeah, that means that I will forever miss him and greet him and wish that things were
*11:42.600- 11:48.640* :  different. But as a parent, aren't you supposed to protect your child? Aren't you supposed to love
*11:48.740- 11:51.980* :  them, even if it means that you don't get what you want?
*11:54.300- 11:56.980* :  Missouri became the first abortion free state.
*12:01.500- 12:06.660* :  The Ponents of Amendment 3 as the vote on restoring the right to an abortion in Missouri is known
*12:06.660- 12:12.820* :  are still battling in the courts and in the court of public opinion to get it struck off the
*12:12.820- 12:19.600* :  ballot in November. That campaign is being led by Republican states, Senator Mary Elizabeth Colman.
*12:20.120- 12:24.320* :  I believe that every life is sacred and that we should do everything we can to protect the
*12:24.320- 12:29.120* :  unborn. And all the polling suggests that a majority of Americans believe that there should be
*12:29.120- 12:35.200* :  some access to abortion. And we've seen Donald Trump, for example, apparently flip-flopping on
*12:35.200- 12:39.980* :  where he stands on this issue because he seems to be aware that actually this may cost him
*12:40.320- 12:44.660* :  the election. Do you think that's true? No, I think if you look at the history of what Donald
*12:44.660- 12:50.460* :  Trump has done in this issue, it's been a little bit messy. Going back to the 2016 campaign,
*12:50.460- 12:55.780* :  I think that like most Americans, it's not his top issue. He's not paying attention to it at
*12:55.780- 12:59.920* :  the same level. And so he'll say things and then he'll learn more and he'll say, you know what,
*12:59.920- 13:05.200* :  actually, I was wrong on that. That was Mary Elizabeth Colman ending that report by James
*13:06.240- 13:10.960* :  and within the past few hours, Missouri's top court has ruled that a proposed abortion rights
*13:10.960- 13:16.840* :  amendment to the state constitution will appear on the ballot in November, allowing voters to
*13:16.840- 13:22.580* :  decide whether to restore legal abortion in Missouri. The United States and its allies are
*13:22.580- 13:28.940* :  imposing new sanctions on Iran and Russia over what they call Tehran's escalatory decision
*13:28.940- 13:34.300* :  to supply ballistic missiles to Moscow. On a visit to London on Tuesday, the US Secretary of
*13:34.300- 13:39.740* :  State Anthony Blinken warned that Russia had received shipments of ballistic missiles from Iran
*13:39.740- 13:45.740* :  and was likely to use them in Ukraine within weeks. For some time, the United States is warned
*13:45.740- 13:52.620* :  of an additional threat, the provision by Iran of ballistic missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine.
*13:54.100- 13:59.980* :  We've warned Tehran publicly, we've warned Tehran privately that taking this step would constitute
*13:59.980- 14:05.160* :  a dramatic escalation. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner told us more about the weapons.
*14:05.780- 14:10.940* :  This is a weapon system called the Fata 360. Fata means victory. It's an Arabic word but
*14:11.160- 14:16.060* :  means the same thing in foreign policy. They are short to medium-range ballistic missiles,
*14:16.060- 14:21.460* :  but a ballistic missile basically goes up in a parabola and comes down very fast. They've got a
*14:21.460- 14:28.340* :  maximum range of 75 miles, which is what roughly about 120 kilometers, but they can carry a payload
*14:28.340- 14:34.400* :  of up to 150 kilos of high explosive. It's thought that they're going to be deployed on the
*14:34.400- 14:41.720* :  battlefield in the next few weeks. They will be quite a game-changer for Russia because it will allow
*14:41.720- 14:49.240* :  Russia to use these against Ukrainian frontline positions, helping to push back their forces in
*14:49.240- 14:55.880* :  the Donbass where they're already slowly retreating and freeing up Russia's own arsenal of longer-range
*14:55.880- 15:01.500* :  ballistic missiles, which they will then use to make life absolutely miserable for people in
*15:01.500- 15:08.760* :  Kiev, Odessa, Lviv, Rivno, further afield cities like that. And there was further detail coming
*15:08.760- 15:16.800* :  out today from the Russians about a new bilateral treaty between Russia and Iran. And that suggests
*15:16.800- 15:22.420* :  that this might not just be a one-off these missiles. It goes to the future as well. So that's
*15:22.520- 15:27.280* :  doubly concerning. They, as in the U.S. and Britain, are very concerned about this and also
*15:27.280- 15:32.100* :  disappointed, I think, because Iran has a new precedent. And Iran has made it clear that it
*15:32.100- 15:37.980* :  wants to reach out and rejoin the rest of the world and take its place. It's rightful seated
*15:37.980- 15:44.340* :  international forums and so on. They're saying it's going on about it in exactly the wrong way.
*15:44.340- 15:50.780* :  It's going in the opposite direction by supplying these weapons and in return getting technology
*15:50.780- 15:58.820* :  from Russia, missile technology and nuclear technology forging this alliance of the pariahs
*15:59.260- 16:03.720* :  as somebody once called it. Well, it's a troubling cooperation, I guess. Don't forget that the two
*16:03.720- 16:08.600* :  countries have got a common body of water between them, the Caspian Sea. And that's where they're
*16:08.600- 16:13.160* :  able to ship these missiles across. Clearly, the U.S. has been able to detect this, probably
*16:13.160- 16:18.740* :  through satellites, but it could be human or have signals intelligence as well. And the U.S. and
*16:18.740- 16:23.780* :  the UK have shown that disappointment, as you expressed it, in saying that there will be further
*16:23.780- 16:31.580* :  sanctions on Tehran, but we've seen the sanctions don't necessarily prevent Tehran from developing
*16:31.580- 16:36.800* :  these new weapons and sending them abroad. They don't. So the sanctions package has already been
*16:36.800- 16:41.200* :  announced. There's a number of individuals who've been sanctioned, but I think most relevant
*16:41.200- 16:48.160* :  perhaps to to UK and Europe is that the E3 that's Britain, France and Germany have announced
*16:48.160- 16:53.600* :  some trade sanctions which include transport. And that means that Iran Air, Iran's national
*16:53.600- 17:00.840* :  carrier is going to be restricted from landing in Britain, but not for another year. So in that
*17:00.840- 17:08.500* :  sense, it's pretty toothless. Frank Gardner. As we record this podcast, 26 people are now known to
*17:08.500- 17:15.500* :  have died after a wooden boat carrying migrants capsides off Senegal's coast on Sunday. The authorities
*17:15.500- 17:20.920* :  say more than 100 people were on board. Our Africa Regional Editor Richard Keigo reports.
*17:21.560- 17:24.660* :  Distraught, relatives and friends have gathered along the beach,
*17:25.080- 17:29.740* :  anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones. So far, four people have been rescued,
*17:29.740- 17:36.360* :  and such efforts are still underway. The water departed from Boer, about 80 km south of Dakar,
*17:36.660- 17:41.200* :  bound for Spain's Canary Islands. In recent years, the number of migrants living
*17:41.200- 17:47.320* :  with Africa through Senegal has surged. Mostly young men, fling conflict, poverty and unemployment

*18:00.980- 18:06.460* :  people can have their hair all the way down to their hips and as long as they want,
*18:06.460- 18:12.700* :  but because my hair grows out, I need to cut it. The campaign to end Afrohead Discrimination.

*19:36.200- 19:41.520* :  Scientists and parents for that matter are constantly trying to uncover more about the mystery
*19:41.520- 19:46.560* :  that is the teenage brain. It's no secret that adolescent brains go through huge changes,
*19:46.980- 19:53.140* :  but researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle found that was only amplified during
*19:53.140- 19:59.580* :  the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, between 2018 and 2021, the time when most of the COVID lockdowns
*19:59.580- 20:05.680* :  took place, they found the adolescent brains of girls aged considerably faster than those of teenage
*20:05.680- 20:13.080* :  boys. I heard more from the BBC's Ella Bicknell. This study involved 160 boys and girls in their
*20:13.280- 20:19.440* :  adolescent years, and they put them through an MRI scanner both before and after the COVID pandemic,
*20:20.060- 20:24.320* :  and what they were doing, they were mapping the brain for what we call cortical thinning,
*20:24.320- 20:29.300* :  and it's a natural biological process, and it happens in the cortex, which is the outermost layer
*20:29.300- 20:35.680* :  of our brain. They found in these teenagers, during that really crucial, very difficult time,
*20:35.680- 20:42.500* :  a lot of them went through, their brains age at a faster rate. For boys, that was 1.4 years faster,
*20:42.700- 20:48.540* :  for girls that was 4.2 years faster, a massive difference. So for example, a girl would walk into
*20:48.540- 20:53.640* :  the lab for their brain to be scanned at age 11. Brain was scanned again at 14, but this scientist
*20:53.640- 20:58.640* :  found that their brain had aged as if they were 18 years old. That's an extraordinary difference
*20:58.640- 21:04.680* :  between boys and girls. Do we know why this was happening? So this study was mainly about
*21:04.680- 21:09.400* :  finding out that it happened. So any theories that come from this are mainly speculative. They
*21:09.400- 21:14.600* :  don't have firm proof, but the lead doctor, Patricia Cull, who I spoke to earlier, she thinks it's
*21:14.600- 21:19.580* :  because of that lack of social interaction. Girls are much more dependent on social interaction
*21:19.580- 21:24.060* :  at their age. When they were mapping the brains, they found 30 regions of the girls' brains have
*21:24.060- 21:30.300* :  been affected, things like their ability to process emotional and social cues. Boys less so,
*21:30.300- 21:34.780* :  only two regions of their brains have been affected. But they're testing out other theories. COVID
*21:34.780- 21:41.180* :  itself was one that they tested out. Dr Cull told me that was an unlikely cause. For example,
*21:41.180- 21:48.040* :  there's no data suggesting that girls acquired COVID more than boys, and the effects in girls
*21:48.040- 21:55.260* :  are so much stronger than in boys. In girls, it's all over the brain. Both hemispheres, all lobes,
*21:55.740- 22:02.900* :  in boys, it's only in visual cortex. Whereas in girls, the areas, again, it's all over, but most
*22:02.940- 22:09.080* :  of the areas have to do with social processing. Areas you're used to think about what others behaviors
*22:09.080- 22:15.300* :  and what their words mean? What she's saying that sounds very concerning. Are there other reasons
*22:15.300- 22:21.020* :  for concern as well? Well, the reason why Dr Cull thinks this could be concerning is she looks
*22:21.020- 22:27.160* :  back on previous literature, previous studies, that shows that a natural development in teenagers,
*22:27.160- 22:33.000* :  that could lead to anxiety and depression in years to come. However, COVID-19 and the pandemic and
*22:33.000- 22:38.940* :  those lockdowns are over for the foreseeable future. It's unlikely that teenagers' brains will go
*22:38.940- 22:45.480* :  through anything like this again. However, Dr Cull and her team stress that. Teenagers undergo a lot
*22:45.480- 22:50.680* :  of chronic stress at the moment, whether that be worries about climate change, cyberbullying,
*22:50.680- 22:56.980* :  a lack of social connection because of the influence of social media. So she says we should still
*22:57.020- 23:02.940* :  keep this at the back of our minds. She also wants further research. How does this impact these
*23:02.940- 23:09.540* :  teenagers into their 20s, into their 30s and then right through into later life? Ella Bicknell.
*23:10.100- 23:15.380* :  In Ukraine, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has said his team are doing
*23:15.380- 23:21.280* :  all they can to deliver justice for crimes committed by Russia. Karim Khan was speaking on a visit
*23:21.280- 23:26.800* :  to Kiev at a children's hospital that was badly damaged by a Russian missile back in July.
*23:26.800- 23:32.560* :  The ICC has already issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and senior members of the Russian
*23:32.560- 23:38.820* :  military, a move which Moscow has condemned. Our Europe correspondent Nick Beak sent this report from
*23:38.820- 23:48.100* :  hospital. A mum desperately calls out for her daughter. A missile has just hit their hospital.
*23:48.800- 23:54.580* :  Oksana says she has no idea if her 16-year-old daughter Solomir is alive or dead.
*23:55.620- 24:04.700* :  Later, they do find each other. Today, on a video call, Solomir told us her overwhelming
*24:04.700- 24:14.040* :  emotion that morning had been fear. It was very scary, but I tried not to listen to the explosions
*24:14.040- 24:21.060* :  and say, when the missile hit, I didn't immediately understand what had happened. I thought that maybe
*24:21.060- 24:25.680* :  I was overthinking and worrying too much, but after some time I understood everything.
*24:29.380- 24:34.260* :  It's two months now since the missile strike at this hospital and in front of us is what remains
*24:34.260- 24:41.140* :  of the intensive care unit. Part of it has been completely leveled. All the windows are blasted
*24:41.140- 24:47.780* :  out. There's a huge amount of debris. And the sight of cancer patients, intensive care patients,
*24:47.820- 24:53.440* :  bloodied, covered in dust and debris being rushed to safety, shocked a lot of people,
*24:53.440- 24:59.200* :  even in this war of so much death and devastation. And for a lot of Ukrainians, it represented
*24:59.240- 25:05.280* :  Russia sinking to a new level in striking Ukraine's biggest children's hospital.
*25:06.740- 25:11.940* :  The international criminal court has been investigating and today its chief prosecutor,
*25:11.940- 25:18.280* :  Karin Khan, came to see the damage for himself and told us his team were pursuing all avenues
*25:18.280- 25:25.060* :  to help deliver justice. We're here for a purpose. It's not a sightseeing visit. It's to move forward
*25:25.060- 25:30.140* :  to make sure we pierce the veil of immunity and make sure the law is felt and that's why we're here.
*25:30.900- 25:36.520* :  Ukraine says Russia hit the hospital. Moscow claimed it was a Ukrainian air defense missile,
*25:37.120- 25:41.500* :  but the United Nations concluded it was highly likely it was a Russian missile.
*25:42.480- 25:47.240* :  So what does Solemya's mum Oksana think the ICC's investigation will bring?
*25:50.040- 25:54.620* :  I think that this will not lead to anything, to any positive result.
*25:55.780- 26:00.840* :  There are international organisations in the world that could prevent all this happening in
*26:00.840- 26:08.480* :  Ukraine, but no one has done anything so far. We put this to the ICC's prosecutor, Karin Khan,
*26:08.480- 26:12.980* :  while he was at the hospital. We're doing our best. It's not going to bring the dead back to life
*26:13.040- 26:17.440* :  and it's not going to mean that it's any easier for the treatment that she's having,
*26:18.120- 26:22.520* :  but we're doing our part and if everybody plays their part, hopefully it can mitigate some of
*26:22.740- 26:25.540* :  the harrowing stories that we're hearing around the world and also hearing Ukraine.
*26:26.320- 26:31.700* :  Both Ukrainian and international prosecutors hope in time evidence gathered here
*26:31.700- 26:38.280* :  will help point to a pattern of Russian attacks. Attacks far from the front line with vulnerable
*26:38.280- 26:45.420* :  civilians in the line of fire. Nick Beak. The European Union's Competition Commissioner has hailed
*26:45.420- 26:51.800* :  two rulings against US technology giants Apple and Google as big wins for European citizens.
*26:51.800- 26:58.560* :  Margaret Etverka said a verdict by the EU's highest court that Apple must pay 14 billion
*26:58.560- 27:02.500* :  dollars in unpaid taxes to Ireland was a victory for tax justice.
*27:02.880- 27:08.380* :  The Court of Justice confirmed the decision from 2016 by the European Commission.
*27:09.580- 27:17.700* :  Ireland granted Apple on offer 8, which Ireland now has to recover and this judgment is final.
*27:19.000- 27:23.540* :  The Court also confirms the Commission decision in the Google Shopping Antitrust case
*27:24.200- 27:26.720* :  and also this is a final judgment.
*27:27.360- 27:30.000* :  The details from our Europe editor, Dali Eberhardt.
*27:30.100- 27:33.660* :  Margaret Avesteier called the Apple ruling a win for tax justice.
*27:34.260- 27:39.700* :  She'd argued eight years ago that an Apple subsidiary had effectively paid tax rates as low as a tiny
*27:39.700- 27:45.460* :  fraction of a single percent on the firm's European profits. Ireland, which had defended its tax
*27:45.460- 27:51.200* :  arrangements, fought the case alongside Apple, but it now has 14 billion dollars of revenue to spend.
*27:51.200- 27:56.400* :  Separately, the European Court of Justice upheld the decision that Google had abused its
*27:56.400- 28:02.040* :  dominant position in online searches by favoring its shopping service. Both Google and Apple say
*28:02.040- 28:07.960* :  they're disappointed with the rulings. Danny Eberhardt. The International Human Rights Charity Global
*28:07.960- 28:14.980* :  Witness says it's documented 196 killings during 2023. People who were tried to stop the
*28:14.980- 28:20.000* :  destruction of natural environments around the world. The reports lead author Laura Theronis
*28:20.000- 28:26.180* :  told my colleague Paul Henry who the people who lost their lives were. A Colombian small scale farmer
*28:26.180- 28:32.620* :  trying to get on with their daily lives and having this at a small plot of land encroached by
*28:32.780- 28:38.940* :  corporate interest activists in the Philippines trying to fend off the structures of the land to
*28:38.940- 28:46.340* :  make way for a large-scale airport, indigenous peoples in the Amazon trying to protect their forests.
*28:46.800- 28:53.620* :  Latin America seems to be a center of these kind of killings tragically and Colombia, especially
*28:53.620- 28:59.020* :  why there. Civil society and social movements and indigenous peoples and local communities are
*28:59.020- 29:04.280* :  really powerful in Latin America, so they're really able to make their voices heard and they're
*29:04.280- 29:10.160* :  being attacked for doing so but also that doesn't mean in any way that being a defender in
*29:10.160- 29:16.740* :  regions like Asia or Africa is any safely. And how carefully researched is your data? Can you
*29:16.740- 29:22.040* :  establish direct links in all these cases between the murder of an individual and specific
*29:22.060- 29:30.000* :  say corporate interests? In 2023 for instance out of the 196 cases we were able to identify mining
*29:30.000- 29:36.400* :  as the sector link to the largest amount of cases and that was 25 all in all but murders are
*29:36.400- 29:43.000* :  the most brutal form of attacks but we you know our report also features a number of cases from
*29:43.000- 29:47.400* :  around the world of defenders who are luckily very much alive but you know our subjective
*29:47.400- 29:52.800* :  authors of non-lethal attacks you know including criminalization which is on the rise globally
*29:52.800- 29:57.120* :  but also threats and harassment and sexual violence I mean the list goes on and on.
*29:57.460- 30:02.280* :  Who do you hope your report will influence most? Well we're hoping that the report will really
*30:02.280- 30:07.400* :  a spectacle with government around the world whose responsibility it is to protect land
*30:07.400- 30:13.560* :  environmental defenders and to make sure that they provide safe operating environments for them
*30:13.700- 30:17.960* :  you know so they can just do their works without fearing for the lives and we're also hoping that
*30:18.760- 30:24.320* :  corporate big enterprises will do the right thing which is exercise due diligence and therefore
*30:24.320- 30:30.200* :  identify you know way before they come to any land to establish their extractive projects just
*30:30.200- 30:34.720* :  establish what risks there are you know and talk to the community says that you know talk to them
*30:34.720- 30:40.380* :  about what the risks might be and and make right decisions about their operations that go beyond
*30:40.380- 30:46.060* :  just profit and take into account a possible human rights violations. Laura Fernos,
*30:46.980- 30:52.760* :  Mel B from the band The Spice Girls has joined other black women in British entertainment by calling
*30:52.760- 30:59.600* :  on MPs to end discrimination against anyone with Afro hair a letter signed by a hundred people says
*30:59.600- 31:05.040* :  that hair discrimination is a panicious form of oppression which dates back to the slave trade
*31:05.040- 31:10.840* :  to stop this they want the UK's equality act updated to make Afro hair a protected
*31:10.840- 31:16.920* :  characteristic along with age, race, religion and sexual orientation the call has been made ahead
*31:16.920- 31:23.600* :  of World Afro Day on Sunday actress and broadcaster Sarah Jane Crawford is part of the campaign
*31:23.600- 31:28.660* :  she told my colleague Sarah Montague about the discrimination. So it's really important to think
*31:28.660- 31:34.800* :  about it in three main areas so we've got school where typically you know a style that is synonymous
*31:34.800- 31:40.960* :  with Afro hair from braids fades locks cane rows styles that are typically penalized in school
*31:41.100- 31:46.880* :  there are bands around having those hairstyles you know right from the get go individuals and
*31:46.880- 31:51.660* :  may to fill on a psychological level as if the hair is inferior it's not good enough and I think
*31:51.660- 31:58.360* :  it's because the Eurocentric aesthetic is considered to be more neat tidy and professional. The other
*31:58.360- 32:04.380* :  area of course then naturally goes into employment where again Afro hair is deemed unprofessional which
*32:04.380- 32:08.500* :  means that you know you experience anxiety before you even go into the workplace because we actually
*32:08.500- 32:14.480* :  have research that shows that you know you are less likely to get a promotion from even being
*32:14.480- 32:19.980* :  hired in the first place and then the third area is health what's really really sad is that
*32:19.980- 32:24.220* :  women of color are more likely to be impacted by harmful toxins because of hair straightening
*32:24.220- 32:29.780* :  products and because of this desire to go after the kind of like professional Eurocentric aesthetic
*32:29.780- 32:35.100* :  you know Afro hair is synonymous with African heritage so if you protect the characteristic of Afro
*32:35.140- 32:40.260* :  hair then a teacher or someone in the workplace it's then illegal for them to want you to have
*32:40.260- 32:44.420* :  straight hair it's then illegal for them to tell you that you can't wear braids because obviously
*32:44.420- 32:50.620* :  this is an Afrocentric style or cane rows or you know a fade if you're having your hair short or locks
*32:51.020- 32:55.900* :  no I have to say you have the most amazing hair thanks have you ever experienced any of
*32:56.720- 33:02.560* :  I think that definitely for me there was like an unspoken rule going into the world of broadcasting
*33:02.620- 33:07.320* :  that I needed to have straight hair I think is definitely changed I was chemically straightening my
*33:07.320- 33:13.420* :  hair from as young as teenage against my mother's wishes but my mother being Caucasian has a different
*33:13.420- 33:17.960* :  hair type to mind so she spent years trying to find different hair products for me that we're going
*33:17.960- 33:23.280* :  to work and you know she was navigating a journey of not being exactly sure what to do and this is
*33:23.280- 33:27.820* :  the case you know with a lot of mixed heritage families as well the industry in terms of hair cares
*33:27.820- 33:32.780* :  definitely moved on but has the conversations around what is deemed professional I mean it would
*33:32.780- 33:36.900* :  be naive for us to say is that even going on do you see what I mean well the mad thing is of course
*33:36.900- 33:41.800* :  if you have straight hair you're trying to get some body and all time but you know what I mean you know
*33:41.800- 33:48.240* :  so if a woman works in a walk into a workplace with a suit on and she has locks or a really large
*33:48.240- 33:55.000* :  Afro that is not generally deemed to be professional as an aesthetic and so therefore indirectly what I
*33:55.000- 33:59.060* :  think very directly that is in itself racism and that's why we need to update the
*33:59.060- 34:04.300* :  legislation update the Equality's Act and include Afro hair as a characteristic Sarah Jane Crawford
*34:06.800- 34:10.540* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later
