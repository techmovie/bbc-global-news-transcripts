*01:09.120- 01:13.200* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:15.620- 01:22.020* :  I'm Nigel Adely, hand of the early hours of Friday the 13th of September. These are our main stories.
*01:22.680- 01:27.940* :  President Putin has warned that if the West allows Ukraine to fire long-range missiles at targets
*01:27.940- 01:34.200* :  inside Russia, it will bring them into direct conflict with Moscow. There's despair in Nigeria
*01:34.220- 01:40.220* :  where hundreds of thousands have been displaced by flooding. A tie caught as issued arrest warrants
*01:40.560- 01:47.220* :  for six retired security personnel over the death of 85 Muslim protesters two decades ago.
*01:50.040- 01:55.120* :  Also in this podcast, in our skin we have four main receptors with the type of
*01:55.220- 02:01.420* :  textured of the object that we are interacting with, the type of stimulus or what is the direction
*02:01.420- 02:07.660* :  of the stimulus as well. Scientists have unveiled new touch technology that potentially could help
*02:07.660- 02:10.860* :  patients who've lost sensitivity in their hands and fingers.
*02:15.680- 02:19.300* :  President Putin has said the West will be in direct conflict with Russia,
*02:19.820- 02:24.620* :  if it allows Ukraine to strike Russian territory with Western-made long-range missiles.
*02:25.440- 02:30.620* :  Mr. Putin said that because NATO military personnel would have to program the flight paths,
*02:31.240- 02:35.040* :  such a move would drag the country's supply and keep into the war.
*02:35.580- 02:43.120* :  If this decision is made, it will mean nothing other than the direct participation of NATO countries,
*02:43.120- 02:48.280* :  the United States and European countries, in the warning Ukraine. And this, of course,
*02:48.280- 02:53.480* :  significantly changes the very essence of the conflict. This will mean that NATO countries
*02:53.480- 02:58.720* :  are fighting with Russia. And if that's the case, we'll make the appropriate decisions based
*02:58.720- 03:03.800* :  on the threats that we face. President Vladimir Zelensky has been urging his allies
*03:03.800- 03:09.700* :  to allow him to hit Russian military targets beyond his border, most recently to a joint UK
*03:09.700- 03:16.080* :  and American mission. President Biden is expected to discuss the issue with the UK Prime Minister
*03:16.080- 03:22.720* :  Kier Starmer on Friday in Washington. Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg was asked if he thought
*03:22.720- 03:28.040* :  these were the most hawkish comments yet we've heard from President Putin regarding the war in
*03:28.040- 03:33.960* :  Ukraine. I think so, yes. And what we heard from Vladimir Putin today was a clear warning to the
*03:33.960- 03:40.240* :  West. Do not do this. Do not allow Ukraine to use your missiles to strike Russian territory.
*03:40.240- 03:45.360* :  What we didn't hear from Vladimir Putin was what Russia is going to do if this actually happens.
*03:45.360- 03:51.880* :  He talked about taking appropriate decisions, but without any detail. Now, what might those
*03:51.880- 03:58.380* :  decisions be? Well, in the past, President Putin has proposed providing advanced long-range weapons
*03:58.380- 04:03.980* :  to Western adversaries to strike Western targets abroad. He's also suggested in the past
*04:03.980- 04:10.380* :  deploying conventional missiles within striking distance of America and its European allies.
*04:10.380- 04:16.440* :  Now, Russian officials many times have accused the West of fighting Russia,
*04:16.440- 04:21.420* :  waging war against Russia on the territory of Ukraine. Putin made it clear today that if this
*04:21.420- 04:27.020* :  goes ahead, if Western missiles are used to target Russian territory, this will take things to a
*04:27.020- 04:32.980* :  whole new level. So, in a sense, Western leaders will have to decide which is greater the risk
*04:33.440- 04:39.680* :  of escalation or the need to help Ukraine and allow Ukraine to strike Russian territory with these
*04:39.680- 04:46.080* :  missiles. Steve Rosenberg in Moscow. I spoke to the defence analyst Jonathan Marcus and asked him how
*04:46.080- 04:51.380* :  serious did he think the Putin threat was? I think there's been a long-standing pattern of these
*04:51.380- 04:57.920* :  kinds of inflammatory remarks from the Russian President. He's frequently stated in the past that
*04:57.920- 05:04.780* :  one or other action, one or other supply of any new type of weaponry to Ukraine by the West will
*05:04.780- 05:11.940* :  lead to all sorts of terrible repercussions from Russia. Often, this has amounted to nuclear
*05:11.940- 05:19.640* :  saber rattling. The reality is that every stage Mr. Putin's bluff has been called and these
*05:19.640- 05:27.400* :  remarks from him have always turned out to be just hot air. The Ukrainians have used Western
*05:27.400- 05:34.780* :  weapons inside Ukraine to some extent already. Ukraine, they've certainly fired them as well into
*05:34.780- 05:40.440* :  Crimea, which of course was part of Ukraine, but Mr. Putin now believes it is part of Russia.
*05:41.060- 05:48.600* :  The Ukraine has invaded Russian territory in the Kursk salient. That hasn't brought any kind of
*05:48.600- 05:55.260* :  Russian nuclear response, so I think many people will write this off just as more rhetoric from
*05:55.260- 06:00.140* :  the Russian leader. Just a reminder is what sort of weapons we're talking about here in this
*06:00.140- 06:06.640* :  particular case. Well, we're talking about two broad types of weapons. One is an air-launched
*06:06.640- 06:12.800* :  cruise missile launched from a fast jet. It's called Storm Shadow in Britain, Scalp in France. It's
*06:12.800- 06:19.440* :  essentially the same weapon. These have already been supplied to Ukraine, and as I say, used to get
*06:19.440- 06:26.980* :  some targets in Crimea and elsewhere. They have a range of, in excess of 250 kilometers. There's
*06:26.980- 06:32.700* :  also then a missile system, which is fired from a multiple launch rocket system, the ATACMS,
*06:32.700- 06:39.640* :  the Army Tactical Missile System, which is a US-supplied weapon. That has a range of up to 300 or
*06:39.640- 06:46.340* :  so kilometers. And again, it's already been supplied and used by the Ukrainians in attacks against
*06:46.340- 06:51.920* :  Russian facilities in Crimea. Do you think the timing here was significant with President Biden
*06:51.920- 06:57.560* :  and Prime Minister Starman meeting? Yes, absolutely. I mean, all the indications are that there seems to be
*06:57.560- 07:03.940* :  a loosening of restrictions coming. Those are certainly the hints that seem to be coming from
*07:03.940- 07:09.380* :  both Washington and from London. The British government, I think, is perfectly happy to lift
*07:09.380- 07:14.700* :  some of the restrictions, but it obviously needs a US cover. And indeed, there are some electronics
*07:14.700- 07:20.420* :  in its missiles, which are sourced from the United States, so the United States permission is
*07:20.420- 07:26.180* :  needed. So I think there will be some kind of relaxation, but probably not an indiscriminate
*07:26.180- 07:32.960* :  permission to use the weapons anywhere. Jonathan Marcus, meanwhile, a Russian strike on Red Cross
*07:32.960- 07:39.000* :  vehicles in the east of Ukraine has killed three aid workers, according to President Zelensky,
*07:39.340- 07:45.380* :  who called it a war crime. The attack happened in a village 100 kilometers from the front line in
*07:45.380- 07:51.640* :  Donetsk. The Red Cross said its team had been preparing to distribute fuel to vulnerable households
*07:51.660- 07:57.380* :  ready for the winter. Two other team members were injured. Paul Henley heard more from our
*07:57.380- 08:02.680* :  correspondent, James Waterhouse, who was in Kiev. We are trying to stitch this together, but
*08:02.680- 08:10.640* :  President Zelensky posted a picture appearing to show a white ICRC Laurie. You could see the Red Cross
*08:10.700- 08:16.420* :  on the side. It was on fire. There were crates at the back. And what the organization is saying is
*08:16.420- 08:21.680* :  that these are teams that regularly operate in the area. They were in a village north of the
*08:21.680- 08:26.500* :  occupied city of Donetsk. This is somewhere very close to the front line, somewhere very dangerous,
*08:26.500- 08:32.140* :  and they were giving out wood and coal briquettes, you know, the type you would see in the barbecue.
*08:32.520- 08:36.880* :  Two people there ahead of what is going to be a difficult winter with the country's infrastructure
*08:36.880- 08:43.600* :  continuing to be targeted. And what they're saying is that a group of vehicles came under artillery
*08:43.600- 08:49.880* :  fire, where three Ukrainian team members lost their lives and two other people were injured.
*08:50.380- 08:55.320* :  Incidents like these are rare. You know, there was an international food kitchen vehicle that was hit
*08:55.320- 09:01.240* :  in July. There were no casualties then. But despite the very real dangers where you have drones overhead,
*09:01.240- 09:06.280* :  where you have the constant thread of missile and artillery strikes, humanitarian teams
*09:06.280- 09:11.880* :  are rarely coming to harm's way. But it's also a reminder of the very real risks they take
*09:11.900- 09:17.080* :  because of how regular they head to these kind of areas. Is there a definitive answer as to
*09:17.080- 09:21.800* :  who's responsible? It's very difficult to pin this down. President Zelensky, as I say,
*09:21.800- 09:28.380* :  is called this another Russian war crime. It's clear in his mind. The ICRC won't be drawn on this.
*09:28.380- 09:33.720* :  They see that as a sort of crucial tenet of their presence as a humanitarian organization.
*09:34.560- 09:38.860* :  But if you look at the fact that it is often Russia, that habitually targets Ukrainian
*09:38.860- 09:44.820* :  controlled territory with artillery strikes. Sometimes they are targeted, you know, because of
*09:44.820- 09:49.740* :  drone reconnaissance, for example. They are able to hit moving vehicles. We've, you know,
*09:49.740- 09:54.480* :  there've been teams of journalists who've been targeted in this way in the past. But equally,
*09:54.480- 10:01.020* :  we see indiscriminate Russian attacks time after time on residential areas. I don't think we will
*10:01.020- 10:06.920* :  ever know for sure what the motive was, whether this was deliberate, and thus far we've had no
*10:06.920- 10:13.580* :  kind of acknowledgement by the Kremlin. But at the very least, this is a very difficult, tragic day
*10:13.580- 10:20.320* :  for teams concerned. James Waterhouse in Ukraine. Now to northeast Nigeria, which has been hit
*10:20.320- 10:25.980* :  by the worst floods in 30 years. Nearly half a million people in Borno State have been displaced.
*10:26.660- 10:33.100* :  As entire residential areas in the state capital, my doigry have been submerged. Around 40 people
*10:33.100- 10:38.380* :  are known to have died, but that number is expected to rise as search and rescue operations
*10:38.380- 10:45.380* :  continue. Zana Barma of the Nigerian Red Cross Society is leading the emergency response from
*10:45.380- 10:51.160* :  my doigry. I'm right now at one of the such and rescue operations collection points,
*10:51.980- 10:59.800* :  where we receive displaced persons in the thousands, mostly women and children who are trapped
*10:59.980- 11:06.400* :  in different locations. We attend to women and children in the thousands stranded and we provide
*11:06.400- 11:13.720* :  them emergency water. We equally along the process, we come across a number of foxes which we
*11:13.720- 11:21.680* :  provide body bags. Our reporter, Asiat Olaoloa, has been covering the floods and she sent this
*11:21.680- 11:27.880* :  update from the area. A lot is needed to do three days into the flood disaster. Hundreds of people
*11:27.880- 11:34.800* :  still stranded. I was at one of the four sediment camps and what I saw was really, I was really
*11:34.800- 11:39.480* :  emotional. I was close to tears because I saw a nursing mother who was six children who said that
*11:39.480- 11:44.780* :  they are not eating anything. She had to give them one plate of food for them to share and it was the
*11:44.820- 11:49.840* :  same. There were many displaced persons in the camp told me. I want to ask the governor about
*11:49.840- 11:54.780* :  why the supplies and the food they are sharing are not going around. He said that they are overwhelmed
*11:54.780- 12:00.180* :  basically and is falling on authorities and all the organizations and even the residents basically
*12:00.180- 12:05.840* :  to give as little as they can because this is a catastrophic incident that is going to hurt the
*12:05.840- 12:11.420* :  state for a long time. Our African regional editor Will Rolls began by telling me about the dam
*12:11.420- 12:17.980* :  collapse that unleashed the flooding. This dam allowed dam, which is south of the state capital,
*12:17.980- 12:24.700* :  my degree, was obviously getting extremely full over the last 10 days or so because of
*12:25.120- 12:30.940* :  torrential rain, relentless rain. There are some reports from within the city from residents living
*12:30.960- 12:36.680* :  there that they spoke to the authorities and said we were worried about this dam and the safety
*12:36.680- 12:44.240* :  of it and there was some kind of an inspection but within days it had broken, the dam wall had broken
*12:44.240- 12:50.460* :  and basically this happened at night and then the water just flooded straight into the city so
*12:50.460- 12:56.720* :  people were asleep as it happened and then literally woke up as the water was kind of rising
*12:56.720- 13:02.420* :  up through their home, so absolutely terrifying scenes and as we just heard there, the rescue
*13:02.420- 13:07.260* :  effort is extremely complicated. And there be a danger now of course of water-borne diseases which
*13:07.260- 13:12.500* :  often happens in situations like this? Yeah, I mean my degree that the infrastructure is not great
*13:13.180- 13:19.300* :  to start with even before this. This is a city that's been through a lot over the last decade and
*13:19.300- 13:25.480* :  a half with conflict and everything but from what we're hearing most of the sewers are kind of
*13:25.480- 13:31.220* :  broken down and there's a lot of contamination from the sewers into the water supply but also
*13:31.220- 13:36.680* :  just to get hold of food and water is difficult at the moment so that's bound to increase
*13:36.680- 13:41.100* :  to increase problems and make people more susceptible. And we've heard about the situation in
*13:41.100- 13:47.200* :  Borno State and my doggery but there seems to be a region-wide problem. It is a region-wide problem
*13:47.360- 13:52.460* :  right the way across from sort of Sudan we've had terrible flooding there which has made you
*13:52.460- 13:58.200* :  know all the efforts to get food to people affected by the war even harder and then also in Chad
*13:58.200- 14:04.300* :  we're talking about one and a half million people affected according to the UN, 300 killed in
*14:04.300- 14:10.960* :  or 300 dead in in recent weeks and then in the far north of Cameroon there's been very heavy
*14:10.960- 14:16.480* :  rain since the end of July and there are photos that I've seen today of people being rescued
*14:16.480- 14:25.260* :  in wooden boats, 200,000 affected there but also quite a big impact on farming areas with thousands
*14:25.260- 14:30.200* :  and thousands of hectares of arable land destroyed so that's going to create a sort of longer term
*14:30.200- 14:37.540* :  problem. Will Ross, Israel has faced international condemnation for an air strike on a school in
*14:37.540- 14:44.340* :  Gaza that's been used to house displaced people. The Hamas run government in Gaza says 18 people
*14:44.340- 14:50.520* :  were killed. The UN Secretary-General described Wednesday's attack as totally unacceptable.
*14:50.700- 14:57.040* :  The UN's main agency in Gaza said six of its staff were among the dead. Israel maintains
*14:57.040- 15:03.360* :  it was targeting Hamas fighters. Our correspondent Paul Adams sent this report from Jerusalem.
*15:04.000- 15:09.400* :  Israel says around half of those killed belonged to Hamas. It's published a list of nine men
*15:09.400- 15:14.080* :  all of whom it says were members of the group's military wing but the Israeli government
*15:14.080- 15:19.780* :  this is the latest sign of Hamas's willingness to embed itself inside Gaza's civilian infrastructure.
*15:20.460- 15:25.460* :  David Menser is a government spokesman. When a school is no longer a school and becomes a
*15:25.460- 15:30.880* :  Hamas commanding control center used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks
*15:30.880- 15:37.800* :  then it becomes a legitimate target. Israel also claims that three of the men on the list published
*15:37.820- 15:44.480* :  today were employed by UNRA, the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees. For months, Israel has accused
*15:44.480- 15:50.220* :  the UN, the Gaza Strip's biggest employer, of allowing Hamas operatives to infiltrate its ranks.
*15:50.220- 15:56.560* :  UNRA said none of the names published today was among 119 previously mentioned by Israel.
*15:57.120- 16:01.680* :  Philippe Lazareini, UNRA's commissioner general, said the attack on the school was devastating.
*16:02.020- 16:07.980* :  This shelter, which is a school in Userat a few days ago, was used for our polio vaccination
*16:07.980- 16:16.420* :  campaign. It is sheltering 12,000 people. We have United Nations staff living there. We had
*16:16.420- 16:22.700* :  absolutely no information before the strike. The Hamas operates inside schools, hospitals and other
*16:22.700- 16:29.180* :  civilian areas is not in doubt. And earlier this year the UN sacked nine employees after Israel
*16:29.180- 16:34.800* :  provided evidence that they were indeed members of Hamas. But in its relentless pursuit of its
*16:34.800- 16:40.340* :  enemies in Gaza, Israel has shown again and again that it is willing to kill significant numbers
*16:40.340- 16:45.420* :  of civilians. And since Israel continues to prevent foreign journalists from entering Gaza,
*16:45.900- 16:50.740* :  it remains extremely hard to get at the truth of each and every tragic episode.
*16:58.860- 17:03.780* :  Billionaire Jared Isaacman, who funded the Polaris Dawn Mission,
*17:03.780- 17:09.540* :  am musician turned engineer Sarah Gillis, stepped out of SpaceX's dragon ship
*17:09.540- 17:15.540* :  to test their next generation spacesuits. Our science reporter Georgina Ranard was watching.
*17:19.260- 17:25.180* :  The Billionaire Jared Isaacman paid an undisclosed amount to fund this five day trip to space.
*17:25.180- 17:30.640* :  He made history when he popped his head out of the SpaceX dragon capsule for around 15 minutes
*17:30.960- 17:35.500* :  and 435 miles beneath him, the blue curve of his home planet.
*17:35.840- 17:40.580* :  Back at home we all have a lot of work to do but from here it sure looks like a perfect road.
*17:41.200- 17:44.700* :  Down on that perfect world, cheers erupted at the SpaceX headquarters.
*17:46.940- 17:51.360* :  One of their own engineers, Sarah Gillis, aged just 30, was next to emerge,
*17:51.760- 17:55.200* :  gently moving her limbs to test the suit while tethered to the craft.
*17:59.360- 18:04.240* :  Both were wearing newly designed spacesuits that can be used inside and outside of the craft.
*18:04.240- 18:09.600* :  And for the first time in decades, there was no airlock in the capsule, exposing the crew to the
*18:09.600- 18:15.160* :  space vacuum outside. It marks a moment when the private space sector matches or even overtakes
*18:15.160- 18:20.220* :  government-funded space exploration, explains Simeon Barber, a research scientist at the Open
*18:20.800- 18:25.500* :  University. Today we've seen a glimpse of the future for human spaceflight with private companies,
*18:25.980- 18:31.460* :  conducting the first ever spacewalk, demonstrating new technologies including spacesuits that
*18:31.460- 18:34.880* :  could be used on future missions to the moon and even onward to Mars.
*18:35.220- 18:39.900* :  Considering the risks of using an inexperienced crew to perform unregulated activities,
*18:39.900- 18:44.860* :  Mr Isaacman will be pleased with the results. But it will be a long time before the ordinary
*18:44.860- 18:47.580* :  person can afford his or her own spacewalk.
*18:48.220- 18:54.660* :  Georgina Ranard. Evan Davis spoke to former NASA astronaut Susan Killrain and began by asking
*18:54.660- 18:59.100* :  her about the new space suit being used on the SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission.
*18:59.500- 19:07.480* :  Oh, they're significantly different. The new SpaceX spacesuits for going outside the vehicle
*19:07.480- 19:13.420* :  are designed much like the ones that they wear inside. But with some, you know, strengthening,
*19:13.420- 19:21.140* :  of course, it's kind of like body armor made from cloth, from fabric, so that it can take
*19:21.400- 19:28.240* :  withstand the pressurization of the space suit, withstand being in space, but also have some
*19:28.300- 19:31.760* :  flexibility and the ability to work in space.
*19:32.800- 19:38.420* :  What's the status of these now? Are they considered tested? Will NASA now use these lighter
*19:38.420- 19:43.300* :  space suits? Do you think or is it a SpaceX monopoly on those for SpaceX missions?
*19:44.540- 19:50.160* :  Well, they're considered having been on a test. There will be other tests. I would assume that
*19:50.160- 19:55.540* :  they'll find things that they might want to modify from what they learned today and go on to
*19:56.000- 20:02.120* :  modify more. But NASA isn't going to be changing their spacesuits anytime soon. But I can't say
*20:02.120- 20:08.220* :  that they won't use similar space suits in the future or perhaps even work jointly together
*20:08.220- 20:15.420* :  on missions to the moon and Mars in the future. I was a bit surprised watching it that they exposed
*20:15.420- 20:21.520* :  four astronauts at the same time. They depressurized the cabin at the same time in these
*20:21.520- 20:27.960* :  spacesuits rather than one. If I wasn't designing it, I'd probably say let's just try to one person
*20:27.960- 20:33.600* :  first maybe or were you surprised at that? Well, because Dragon doesn't have an airlock,
*20:33.600- 20:39.920* :  it's not possible to just do one person or two people. And if you think back to the original
*20:39.920- 20:46.060* :  Gemini days and Apollo days, spacewalks were done the same where we depressurized the entire capsule.
*20:47.040- 20:54.980* :  So it's not new technology. And I will say also that the Dragon has been has undergone significant
*20:55.000- 21:01.120* :  testing in a vacuum environment to make sure that this was going to work without fail.
*21:02.100- 21:07.760* :  Now you're best as you can, of course, as always. Yeah. You know what Elon Musk's real mission is.
*21:07.760- 21:12.820* :  He's been spelling it out again today. He's tweeted it out when we go out there to explore the galaxy.
*21:12.860- 21:17.880* :  We'll find many dead one planet civilizations that never made it to the next planet.
*21:18.300- 21:23.760* :  His goal is Mars. This is just the the starter, isn't it? How realistic in
*21:24.900- 21:29.960* :  space industry, his aspirations considered? First of all, I think most of us
*21:29.960- 21:36.880* :  have realized not to underestimate Elon Musk in any of his endeavors. But I do think he is still
*21:36.880- 21:43.360* :  a ways off, but he is working towards that goal. And he's actually launched a mission yesterday,
*21:43.420- 21:50.800* :  the Polaris mission where they're doing significant testing and science all about going further
*21:50.800- 21:57.600* :  into space. They went higher up into space. They went into greater radiation area. They've
*21:58.300- 22:05.220* :  you know, working on this new suit, done the first civilian extra vehicular work. So I mean,
*22:05.220- 22:11.220* :  this is all towards going further into space. Former NASA astronaut Susan Killrain.
*22:14.000- 22:19.060* :  Still to come, a warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture. So when these storms do come
*22:19.060- 22:25.120* :  in the future, they are likely to bring more intense rainfall and more of these issues with flooding.
*22:25.420- 22:30.100* :  We assess the reasons behind Typhoon Naji, which has battered Southeast Asia.

*23:30.700- 23:35.940* :  Workers at Boeing's West Coast plans have started voting on a new contract offer offered
*23:35.940- 23:43.240* :  by the US Aerospace Giant. If it's rejected by the 33,000 employees, strike action could begin
*23:43.240- 23:51.820* :  on Friday. The proposed deal includes a general wage increase of 25%, a bonus and a pledge to
*23:51.820- 23:58.000* :  build Boeing's next commercial jet in the Seattle area. Gideon Long heard more from the BBC's
*23:58.000- 24:02.980* :  International Business Correspondent Theo Lakers. There's a great deal at stake here, Gideon,
*24:02.980- 24:09.080* :  for 33,000 unionized workers in Washington State, mainly at Boeing's Rent and Factory,
*24:09.080- 24:14.680* :  where it makes for the 737 and at its Everett factory, where it makes the triple-7.
*24:14.960- 24:20.940* :  And also some workers as well in Portland, Oregon, which makes parts for civilian aircraft and
*24:21.560- 24:27.640* :  drones as well. What they're voting on is a four year new contract that has been negotiated
*24:27.640- 24:33.280* :  between the IM, the union and Boeing. But the essential point that it makes is it will increase
*24:33.340- 24:40.160* :  pay across the board by about 25% over four years. It includes extra benefits, like reduced
*24:40.160- 24:47.160* :  mandatory overtime, better health benefits, a slightly better retirement program. And Boeing and
*24:47.160- 24:54.700* :  the union leadership seem very pleased with this. But it has to be voted on by Boeing workers.
*24:55.420- 25:01.180* :  If they approve it, it'll go ahead. If they reject it, they will also vote on whether or not
*25:01.180- 25:07.760* :  to take strike action. And if two thirds of those balleted vote for strike action, then a strike
*25:07.760- 25:13.720* :  could begin at Boeing from midnight Thursday into Friday Pacific time. Do we get any sense of how
*25:13.720- 25:18.340* :  likely it is to be approved? So although the way the voting works with a two thirds majority
*25:18.340- 25:24.360* :  needed for a strike, that seems to put Boeing in the pound seat, it seems to suggest that this
*25:24.360- 25:30.280* :  contract will be approved, it is by no means a done deal. The union leadership have recommended
*25:31.560- 25:36.280* :  this. But there have been demonstrations over the past week, particularly outside Boeing's
*25:36.280- 25:42.420* :  Everett plant, by a large number of workers who are clearly angry, some of them suggesting even
*25:42.420- 25:48.960* :  that they've been sold out by the union leadership. There is antipathy between Boeing's workers
*25:48.960- 25:55.060* :  and Boeing management that is not new. It goes back years. It goes back to a time when Boeing went
*25:55.060- 26:00.960* :  into negotiations like these on previous contracts in a position of strength and effectively
*26:00.960- 26:06.080* :  ratcheted down the terms and conditions of workers, including taking away their guaranteed
*26:06.080- 26:12.160* :  pension plans because it could threaten them with taking production out of Washington state
*26:12.160- 26:17.540* :  and to other areas of the country where there would be much less unionisation. And that's why
*26:17.540- 26:23.200* :  incidentally, I think that one of the items that Boeing's put in this proposal is the suggestion
*26:23.200- 26:28.440* :  that if it starts building a new aircraft design within the next four years, that new aircraft
*26:28.440- 26:33.620* :  would be built in Washington state. But whether the workforce are impressed by that, whether they
*26:33.620- 26:39.880* :  feel they can trust management, that's likely to be key. Theo Leggett, a Thai quarters-issued arrest
*26:39.880- 26:47.300* :  warrants for six retired security personnel over the deaths of 85 Muslim protesters two decades ago.
*26:47.820- 26:54.380* :  A seventh suspect, an MP with immunity, has been ordered to appear in court. Mickey Bristo has the
*26:54.380- 27:00.960* :  story. The incident in 2004 is known as the attack by massacre. It began when hundreds of
*27:00.960- 27:06.320* :  Muslims protested outside a police station in the south of Thailand. Seven were shot dead.
*27:06.940- 27:12.340* :  Others were rounded up and crammed on top of each other into waiting trucks and driven five
*27:12.340- 27:18.480* :  hours to an army base. At the end of the journey, 78 had suffocated. No one has ever been
*27:18.480- 27:23.900* :  prosecuted for the deaths. Families of those who died launched their own lawsuit this year
*27:24.440- 27:31.180* :  before a 20-year window for prosecutions runs out. Mickey Bristo, millions of people across
*27:31.180- 27:36.740* :  Southeast Asia have suffered the impact of Typhoon Yaji, the most powerful storm to hit the
*27:36.740- 27:43.100* :  South China Sea in 30 years. It's caused widespread damage in multiple provinces and countries.
*27:43.860- 27:49.420* :  226 people have died in Vietnam. Nine people are known to have died in northern Thailand.
*27:49.500- 27:55.420* :  In Myanmar, 17 bodies have been recovered from flooded villages in the Mandalay region.
*27:55.420- 28:02.540* :  50,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. Ben Rich from BBC Weather told me more about
*28:02.540- 28:08.060* :  the storm and where it could be heading next. Yaji is not a Typhoon anymore. It hasn't been a
*28:08.060- 28:14.200* :  Typhoon for several days because as soon as these storms make landfall, they lose the warm water
*28:14.200- 28:19.300* :  of the ocean. That's what gives them their fuel. And so in terms of wind, the storm eases.
*28:19.400- 28:25.160* :  This is not a Typhoon anymore. But what we've got is an area of low pressure left behind a lump
*28:25.160- 28:30.940* :  of rain if you like that is pushing its way westwards. It has been moving across some parts of Thailand.
*28:30.940- 28:35.700* :  It is now moving across Myanmar. It will also believe it will not be affecting Bangladesh and
*28:35.700- 28:41.020* :  northern parts of India as we head through the next couple of days. Of course, it's the rainy season
*28:41.020- 28:46.540* :  and we should expect storms at this time of year. But is there anything unusual about storm Yaji?
*28:46.720- 28:51.260* :  So yes, this is the rainy season. The southwest monsoon that affects that whole sway
*28:51.260- 28:56.940* :  of Southeast Asia. And what Yagi has done or the remnants of Yagi, it's been an injection of
*28:57.320- 29:02.040* :  extra moisture if you like. So it has enhanced those monsoon downpours made them more intense.
*29:02.040- 29:07.340* :  And that's why we've seen the widespread impact. Now, these are Typhoons and tropical storms
*29:07.340- 29:12.920* :  in this part of the world. They tend to form in the Pacific. They then drift westwards.
*29:13.280- 29:18.160* :  And normally at some point, they bend northwards far enough that they're sort of taken away
*29:18.160- 29:22.680* :  towards the northeast by the winds that blow high up in the atmosphere. This one has stayed
*29:23.160- 29:27.640* :  on pretty much a solidly westward track. So it's avoided those winds that would have torn it
*29:27.640- 29:32.180* :  apart and taken it away. And that's why it's been allowed to move across all of these different
*29:32.180- 29:37.700* :  countries in that Southeast and part of Asia. Looking at the data, is this an exceptional
*29:38.220- 29:43.000* :  rainy season or the norm now? This is obviously an exceptional thing to have
*29:43.000- 29:49.440* :  happened at this point and obviously is enhancing the monsoon rains. Now, climate change is making
*29:49.440- 29:56.180* :  intense rainfall more likely. In terms of these storms, we are not necessarily going to see more
*29:56.180- 30:01.240* :  of these tropical storms and typhoons as a result of climate change. In fact, the evidence is that
*30:01.240- 30:07.480* :  we probably won't see more of these storms. But when they do develop, higher sea surface temperatures
*30:07.480- 30:13.840* :  will mean that they are able to intensify more rapidly. So that could bring more intense winds,
*30:13.840- 30:18.920* :  stronger and more damaging winds. And then on top of that, a warmer atmosphere, a warmer air
*30:19.220- 30:24.520* :  is able to hold more moisture. So these storms are able to hold and squeeze out more rainfall.
*30:24.520- 30:30.660* :  So when these storms do come in the future, they are likely to bring more intense rainfall and more
*30:30.660- 30:36.860* :  of these issues with flooding. Ben Rich. Researchers have unveiled new touch technology
*30:36.860- 30:42.140* :  that potentially could help patients with our sensitivity in their hands and fingers.
*30:42.600- 30:47.660* :  It could also be used to operate robotics for medical surgery or safely handle radioactive
*30:47.660- 30:54.440* :  materials in nuclear decommissioning. Haptic technology is designed to create the perception
*30:54.440- 31:01.140* :  of touch. A new system was created by researchers and university college London, who say it creates
*31:01.140- 31:06.780* :  the real experience of touching objects, stimulating the full range of sensors on our fingertips
*31:06.780- 31:12.180* :  for the first time. Dr Sara Abad is the lead researcher on the project.
*31:12.960- 31:18.920* :  The new technology that we have developed is bio-inspired on the human sense of touch.
*31:19.280- 31:26.020* :  So we look into how we interact with our world, which is basically our skin. And in our skin,
*31:26.020- 31:32.440* :  we have four main receptors, which are mainly associated with touch. Each one of them provides a
*31:32.440- 31:37.740* :  different type of information. It gives us the type of texture of the object that we are interacting
*31:37.820- 31:44.520* :  with the type of stimulus or what is the direction of the stimulus as well. So we can provide
*31:44.520- 31:51.200* :  stimulus across the whole finger so it's more realistic as well in that sense. Depending on how much
*31:51.200- 31:58.560* :  you have lost, we can quantify this so we can measure it periodically so we can study how it
*31:58.560- 32:04.860* :  is evolving over time. It has so many applications. So for instance, it can be applied in the social
*32:04.860- 32:11.040* :  context. Nowadays, we do several video calls every day. But unfortunately, the difference between
*32:11.040- 32:17.680* :  a face-to-face interaction is we develop social bonding due to the sense of touch. If we provide
*32:17.680- 32:23.360* :  that information using our fingertip interface to the video calls, we want to enhance those
*32:23.360- 32:29.580* :  video calls and we would like to promote how it can enhance the social bonding. So what we will do
*32:29.580- 32:35.820* :  is we will embed our interfacing a glove so you will be able to, when you are interacting,
*32:35.820- 32:39.060* :  you will receive the information the stimulus is straight to your fingers.
*32:39.660- 32:42.740* :  Dr. Sarah Abbott from University College London.
*32:45.440- 32:50.560* :  And that's all for us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
