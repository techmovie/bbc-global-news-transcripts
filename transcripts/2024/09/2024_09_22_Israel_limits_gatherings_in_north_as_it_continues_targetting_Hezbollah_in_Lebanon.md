*01:16.040- 01:20.820* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Sunday, the 22nd of September, these are our main stories.
*01:21.520- 01:25.020* :  Dozens of Israeli warplanes have been carrying out widespread attacks
*01:25.020- 01:30.920* :  on his bullet targets in southern Lebanon. Elon Musk has backed down in his legal fight
*01:30.920- 01:36.220* :  with a Brazilian judge who closed down his social media platform X in the country.
*01:36.940- 01:41.820* :  Vladimir Karamosa, the Russian dissident freed in a prisoner swap last month,
*01:42.180- 01:46.880* :  has told the BBC he thought he was about to be executed when guards came to fetch him in the night.
*01:51.660- 01:56.140* :  You go back to the 16th century, and beyond, and you've got kings declaring that their
*01:56.700- 02:00.040* :  role in life, that their purpose is to put chicken in everybody's pot.
*02:00.520- 02:05.340* :  No wonder Council workers are revolting over a decision to introduce vegetarian only
*02:05.340- 02:07.060* :  canteen food twice a week.
*02:10.800- 02:14.900* :  The Israeli military says dozens of its planes have carried out more widespread
*02:14.900- 02:18.160* :  air strikes on his bullet targets in southern Lebanon.
*02:18.600- 02:23.140* :  They say they took the action after identifying plans by the movement to escalate
*02:23.140- 02:27.540* :  rocket attacks on Israel. In anticipation to retaliatory strikes,
*02:27.540- 02:32.440* :  Israel announced restrictions on civilian gatherings from the northern city of Haifa
*02:32.880- 02:37.660* :  up to the border with Lebanon. On Saturday evening, Daniel Hagarri, a spokesperson for the
*02:37.660- 02:40.840* :  Israeli Defense Forces, or IDF, gave this update.
*02:41.460- 02:45.060* :  In the last hour, we've been attacking widely in southern Lebanon,
*02:45.060- 02:50.380* :  following the identification of his belas preparations to fire into Israeli territory.
*02:51.100- 02:56.600* :  Dozens of war planes are currently attacking terror targets and launches to eliminate the threats
*02:56.600- 02:58.360* :  against the citizens of Israel.
*02:58.700- 03:02.940* :  Well, earlier, hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group, fired dozens of rockets into
*03:02.940- 03:08.900* :  northern Israel from Lebanon. The ongoing cross-border strikes by both sides have raised
*03:08.900- 03:13.880* :  fresh concerns about the conflict escalating even more and spreading even further.
*03:14.400- 03:18.400* :  The U.S. National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, warned that the escalation in fighting
*03:18.400- 03:24.540* :  could ignite a regional war. Andrea Tenenti is a spokesperson for the UN peacekeeping mission
*03:24.540- 03:26.060* :  Unifil in Beirut.
*03:26.540- 03:30.960* :  Definitely, the situation now is really concerning and the escalations of these days
*03:31.640- 03:37.400* :  also very worrying and all actors need to immediately de-escalate. A solution is still
*03:37.400- 03:42.720* :  possible, but of course you need a commitment of the parties and at the moment the situation
*03:42.720- 03:49.120* :  is more than concerning that could potentially escalate to a wider conflict and not only a conflict
*03:49.120- 03:52.100* :  between Isbol and Israel, but a regional conflict.
*03:52.480- 03:55.940* :  Karen Genoni spoke to the BBC's senior international correspondent,
*03:55.940- 03:59.860* :  Ola Garian, who's in Beirut, on Saturday evening and got the latest.
*04:00.420- 04:05.060* :  Tonight Israel has been stepping up its bombardment of southern Lebanon.
*04:05.740- 04:12.520* :  Now, it says it is doing that in response to intelligence it had that Hasbola was planning to
*04:12.520- 04:18.600* :  carry out a series of attacks on Israel. So, Israel is presenting this as preemptive action
*04:18.600- 04:25.340* :  on its part. It says dozens of warplanes are involved. We've been receiving video from locations
*04:25.340- 04:31.340* :  in the south which show really massive air strikes taking place and that's been the situation
*04:31.380- 04:37.400* :  throughout the day today and indeed yesterday some of the heaviest bombardment that we have seen
*04:38.040- 04:44.480* :  in this year-long conflict. Now, we also know that today Hasbola for its part, the Iranian
*04:44.480- 04:50.220* :  Backed Group. It isn't backing down. It has continued firing rockets across the border
*04:50.860- 04:57.620* :  into Israel up to 100 rockets and Israel says that specifically it was targeting Hasbola
*04:57.620- 05:03.440* :  rocket launch sites. But I have to say in broad terms that if the international community
*05:04.020- 05:07.660* :  was worried before about what's going on here and I think it certainly was,
*05:07.660- 05:13.740* :  well I imagine it will be much more concerned tonight. The images we're seeing from the border
*05:13.740- 05:20.700* :  area show large explosions, show fires on the southern side of the border were told there are
*05:20.700- 05:27.160* :  also fires on the Israeli side and of course in recent days Israel has been stepping up its
*05:27.160- 05:32.100* :  attacks on Hasbola. First of all with the exploding walkie-talkies, the exploding
*05:32.100- 05:38.680* :  pages and then of course yesterday's deadly air strike here in Beirut in which the death toll
*05:38.680- 05:44.400* :  has now risen to 37. And those series of attacks and all sorts of different methods all of
*05:44.400- 05:50.200* :  that you mentioned, what impact have the last few days had on Hasbola's capacity to fight?
*05:50.200- 05:55.380* :  I think we can't be sure about that yet but it has certainly been devastating. It's been a
*05:55.380- 06:01.720* :  series of devastating blows for the organization. At first of all country-wide its communications
*06:01.720- 06:08.720* :  network has been severely disrupted. Many of its members have been injured, many innocent members
*06:08.720- 06:15.060* :  of the public also and indeed two children died during that wave of attacks, the exploding
*06:15.180- 06:22.040* :  pages when they picked them up. So many Hasbola members wounded, many, many killed. The communications
*06:22.040- 06:28.920* :  network disrupted. Then yesterday Israel targeted a very senior military commander,
*06:28.920- 06:34.780* :  Ebrahim Akeel, managed to kill him and other senior commanders who were meeting below ground in
*06:34.780- 06:41.140* :  Beirut. That will have had an impact on Hasbola's ability to respond. We just don't yet know
*06:41.640- 06:47.520* :  how and when it's going to be able to mount a response at what level of response it can manage
*06:47.520- 06:53.120* :  at this stage. All are gathering in Beirut. For months now there has been a standoff between
*06:53.120- 06:59.320* :  Brazil and the social media platform X. The app was suspended in the country last month on the
*06:59.320- 07:05.180* :  basis that hundreds of accounts were spreading disinformation and far-right views. But now the
*07:05.180- 07:10.540* :  New York Times says an agreement has been reached in court. Our America's regional editor is Leonardo
*07:10.540- 07:16.940* :  Russia. What the New York Times says is that Elon Musk, his lawyers, told them that they have
*07:16.940- 07:22.900* :  decided to abide by the court orders in Brazil. There were three conditions that the Supreme Court
*07:22.900- 07:29.600* :  judge, in charge of the case, Alexandre de Morais had put to X, said they had to block the accounts
*07:29.600- 07:36.420* :  of about 300 people accused of spreading disinformation and anti-democratic information or far-right
*07:36.420- 07:41.700* :  views. They had also to reappoint the legal representative in Brazil and they had to reopen
*07:41.700- 07:48.400* :  their office in Brazil. And all that changed last month when Elon Musk refused to do. He called
*07:48.400- 07:55.020* :  the judge Morais a criminal authoritarian and just refused. He closed the office basically so that
*07:55.020- 08:00.480* :  there will be no legal representation for his company in Brazil. But that has cost him probably
*08:00.540- 08:07.180* :  1,000 millions of users and he's now decided to to backtrack and to abide by the legislation.
*08:07.300- 08:12.980* :  What the New York Times is saying is that X services should be resumed in Brazil in the next few
*08:12.980- 08:18.240* :  days. And this spat between X and the Brazilian authorities goes back some way, doesn't it?
*08:18.440- 08:23.920* :  Talk us through the context. It's been going on for a while because what you had in Brazil is
*08:24.460- 08:29.620* :  with the previous government, the right-wing government of Jair Bolsonaro, this judge started to
*08:29.620- 08:35.720* :  look into the present himself and his supporters and saying they were spreading fake news online
*08:35.720- 08:41.140* :  in calling, for example, for a military coup, calling for the closure of the Supreme Court,
*08:41.140- 08:47.100* :  the closure of Congress, which banned by the Brazilian Constitution. So that was going on before
*08:47.100- 08:52.720* :  this whole spat with X started. And then many of those people, those users, were spreading
*08:52.720- 08:58.840* :  these messages or posting their messages through the social media platform X. And then the judge
*08:58.840- 09:03.740* :  was checking what's called the fake news inquiry, told him, look, these are the lists of people
*09:03.740- 09:08.580* :  that we've checked and they need to be banned or suspended from your services. And Elon Musk said,
*09:08.580- 09:13.780* :  this is against the law, this is censorship, this goes against the Brazilian Constitution, the
*09:13.780- 09:18.320* :  basic principles of freedom of speech. And I'm not going to abide by the law. So the Brazilian
*09:18.320- 09:24.840* :  Supreme Court was issuing fines, making threats until last month, they decided, look,
*09:24.840- 09:30.300* :  the services are suspended. And that's where we are now. They have about 20 million users in
*09:30.300- 09:34.680* :  Brazil, one of the biggest in the world. And I think that Elon Musk doesn't want to lose that.
*09:34.860- 09:40.000* :  Yeah, so it's good for X. I get those tens of millions of users back in Brazil. As you said,
*09:40.000- 09:45.360* :  it must have been tougher, Elon Musk, to capitulate like this. Not only for him, but also for
*09:45.360- 09:51.280* :  supporters of the former President Bolsonaro and many people who saw him as a beacon of liberty in
*09:51.280- 09:56.500* :  Brazil that were going to challenge the Supreme Court. But for example, what's being said is he
*09:56.500- 10:02.560* :  compromised to government demands in India and Turkey, for example, because probably because
*10:02.560- 10:07.940* :  those are important markets. But what I've seen online from people who are living abroad in the
*10:07.940- 10:12.900* :  United States, who are, say, conservative right wing supporters, they are very disappointed
*10:12.900- 10:17.840* :  with Elon Musk bowing to pressure from the Supreme Court, George. Leonardo Rosha.
*10:18.680- 10:24.600* :  The US Vice President, Carmela Harris, has accepted an invitation from CNN to hold a second
*10:24.600- 10:30.140* :  debate with Donald Trump in the run up to November's presidential election. Her campaign team said
*10:30.140- 10:34.860* :  Mr. Trump should have no problem agreeing to the challenge given that he believed he'd won their
*10:34.860- 10:40.260* :  recent head-to-head and the format was the same. But the former president said it was too late
*10:40.260- 10:46.000* :  to hold another debate. The problem with another debate is that it's just too late. Voting has already
*10:46.000- 10:52.440* :  started. She's had her chance to do it with Fox. You know, Fox invited us on and I waited and waited.
*10:54.080- 10:59.060* :  They turned it down. They turned it down. But now she wants to do a debate right before the election
*10:59.060- 11:05.600* :  was CNN because she's losing badly. Ms. Harris is widely considered to have outperformed her
*11:05.600- 11:11.120* :  Republican challenger in September's contest. Mr. Trump had already ruled out holding a second.
*11:11.940- 11:16.040* :  Staying with the US presidential election, here's a quick message from Oliver Conway.
*11:16.580- 11:20.460* :  Hi, all just a quick reminder that in the run up to the US presidential election,
*11:20.460- 11:24.960* :  we'll be doing a special podcast in collaboration with our friends at BBC America.
*11:25.180- 11:29.460* :  But we need your help to come up with questions to put to the team in the US.
*11:29.460- 11:36.060* :  So if there's anything you'd like to know, please send us an email to globalpodcast.bbc.co.uk
*11:36.060- 11:41.780* :  or tweet us at Global NewsPod. And if possible, please record your question in a voice note.
*11:42.140- 11:46.040* :  Thank you. Thanks, Oli. Now a leading Russian dissident,
*11:46.040- 11:52.100* :  freed in a prisoner swap, has said he thought he was about to be executed when guards came to fetch him.
*11:52.480- 11:59.380* :  Vladimir Karamursa had been given a 25-year sentence for treason after criticising the war in Ukraine
*11:59.380- 12:06.440* :  and had already served nearly a year in solitary confinement. Mr. Karamursa told the BBC what happened.
*12:07.100- 12:12.200* :  I was asleep on suddenly the doors to my prison cell burst open and group of prison officers
*12:12.440- 12:17.860* :  barged in. I was woken up. I saw that it was dark. I asked what time it was. They said 3am.
*12:18.740- 12:23.520* :  And they told me to get up and get ready in 10 minutes. At that moment, I was absolutely certain
*12:23.520- 12:29.240* :  that I was being let out to be executed. But instead of the nearby wood, they took me to the airport,
*12:29.780- 12:34.120* :  handcuffed with a prison convoy, brought me on a plane and flew me to Moscow.
*12:34.860- 12:37.720* :  He said that his release from prison still feels surreal.
*12:38.260- 12:41.980* :  Since the prison had changed, it has felt as if I've been watching some kind of a film.
*12:42.180- 12:46.720* :  It's a very good one, but it still does not feel real, because just a few weeks ago I was sitting in
*12:46.720- 12:50.560* :  my two by three meters cell in solitary confinement in a maximum security prison in Siberia,
*12:51.100- 12:56.440* :  thinking that I was never getting out of there. Here I am sitting with you. This exchange is
*12:56.440- 13:01.280* :  tested on you too. The fact that at the end of it all, public opinion in democratic countries
*13:01.820- 13:04.480* :  is more powerful than any dictatorship can ever help to you.
*13:04.840- 13:06.160* :  Vladimir Karamosa
*13:07.500- 13:12.040* :  In the German state of Brandenburg, people will head to the polls on Sunday in another
*13:12.040- 13:17.500* :  election dominated by immigration. Earlier this month, the anti-migrant far-right alternative
*13:17.500- 13:24.220* :  for Germany or AFD won an election for the first time. It's all very different from a decade ago
*13:24.220- 13:29.840* :  when the then-chancellor Angela Merkel allowed in one and a half million refugees and migrants.
*13:29.840- 13:35.620* :  Many of them are now becoming German citizens, but how do the new Germans feel about the
*13:35.620- 13:40.460* :  increasing hostile debate around migration? Damian McGinnis has been finding out.
*13:42.060- 13:51.660* :  So we are in Smitarnesstraße 31 in front of the school, Jamhol, where I used to live for six months.
*13:52.360- 13:59.500* :  In 2015, Parvine spent months traveling mostly on foot from Afghanistan to Europe
*14:00.020- 14:05.060* :  with her three-year-old son and her disabled nephew. They were shot at by border guards
*14:05.720- 14:11.820* :  and Parvine feared for her life in the Mediterranean when the overcrowded rubber dinghy they were in,
*14:11.820- 14:20.100* :  crossing from Turkey to Greece started sinking. Somehow you got to forget the person you are
*14:20.180- 14:25.960* :  and how you were leaving in your country like a human being. That was breaking me down.
*14:27.560- 14:34.080* :  Life has changed a lot. Recently I received my citizenship.
*14:39.860- 14:46.660* :  The image I remember most from 2015 is Munich train station, where many refugees arrived in
*14:46.660- 14:52.600* :  Germany for the first time. Most had come from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.
*14:55.880- 15:01.280* :  They were greeted by locals holding up signs saying welcome and handing out food, drink and teddy bears,
*15:01.920- 15:08.340* :  and many Germans suddenly felt proud of the nation's new found identity as a welcoming safe haven.
*15:10.240- 15:15.060* :  But what became known then as the welcome culture is today hard to find.
*15:15.780- 15:20.060* :  Three people were killed, eight more suffered severe knife wounds after a man attacked people
*15:20.380- 15:26.340* :  apparently at the ramp. Germany is in a political meltdown over migration in part because of the
*15:26.380- 15:32.660* :  fallout of a brutal stabbing in the town of Zorlingon in August. It was a Syrian asylum seeker.
*15:32.720- 15:38.940* :  I say he is a member of the Islamic State group. The attack has only played into the hands of those
*15:39.060- 15:47.540* :  who wish to connect refugees and migrants with crime and terror. Right now everything is coming to
*15:47.540- 15:52.800* :  ahead and now is the opportunity to say we're incredibly afraid and we know we are being threatened.
*15:52.960- 15:57.980* :  Asaltana came to Germany a decade ago from Afghanistan when she was just 10 years old.
*15:58.380- 16:03.420* :  Today she's about to go to law school but she's still waiting for her German citizenship.
*16:04.060- 16:09.120* :  I met her in the eastern state of Therinja as she was planning a protest against the far-right
*16:09.120- 16:14.100* :  AFD party which is just one of the most votes in the regional election here.
*16:14.800- 16:17.580* :  But you have to understand that this has been the reality for years.
*16:23.760- 16:30.020* :  Meanwhile Paven with her new German passport has been able to visit her sister in London for the
*16:30.040- 16:39.440* :  first time. I found London really different than Berlin. I even cried for a couple of times
*16:39.440- 16:45.900* :  and I think people being so nice to each other. She's also just qualified as a social worker
*16:46.320- 16:52.460* :  and is now thinking about moving to the UK because she doesn't feel welcome in Germany anymore.
*16:53.200- 16:58.800* :  According to one study a quarter of people with a migrant heritage in Germany are also thinking
*16:58.840- 17:03.140* :  about leaving and 10 percent have concrete plans to emigrate.
*17:03.660- 17:12.080* :  Saltana though is staying and her anti-racism demo drew huge crowds.
*17:14.360- 17:19.180* :  Her answer to the far right is not to leave but to get more politically active.
*17:19.920- 17:24.560* :  We have no choice. Many of the migrants have no citizenship and so have no right to vote.
*17:25.360- 17:30.300* :  But we have voices and we want to take these voices out onto the streets and say we are here
*17:30.300- 17:35.400* :  and we are staying here and we will keep fighting and we will not let our rights be taken away.
*17:39.380- 17:44.980* :  That report was by Damien McGinnis in Germany. Still to come.
*17:45.660- 17:48.880* :  The cost has been heavy for both sides in this hell spot in Arnhem.
*17:48.920- 17:53.980* :  Further south the Second Army has taken a large hall of enemy prisoners but in spite of their successes
*17:53.980- 17:59.880* :  the British have been unable to force away through. 80 years on hundreds of NATO paratroopers
*17:59.880- 18:05.600* :  have landed near the Dutch city marking the anniversary of the Second World War operation
*18:05.880- 18:06.560* :  Market God.

*19:20.740- 19:26.320* :  Sri Lanka has imposed an overnight curfew across the island hours after polls closed in the
*19:26.320- 19:31.400* :  country's presidential election. Voting went peacefully, but the authorities said the additional
*19:31.400- 19:36.360* :  measure was put in place to ensure public safety. As votes are being counted, security officials
*19:36.360- 19:42.060* :  have been seen patrolling the streets. The election is widely seen as a referendum on the government
*19:42.060- 19:48.100* :  handling of the economy. The full results are not expected until at least Sunday. Our South
*19:48.100- 19:53.680* :  Asia correspondent Samira Hussein reports from the capital Colombo. Two years ago skyrocketing
*19:53.680- 19:59.960* :  inflation and severe shortages of food and petrol sparked mass protests and forced Sri Lanka's
*19:59.960- 20:06.400* :  deeply unpopular leader, Gautobaya Raja Bucksa, from office. The country is still reeling from
*20:06.400- 20:11.520* :  the effects of the crisis and the economy remains the most important issue for voters today.
*20:12.080- 20:17.020* :  Everything is so expensive at the moment. So we would like to change in that as well. When it comes
*20:17.020- 20:22.420* :  to daily expenses, when it comes to children's expenses and everything is expensive. Like most of
*20:22.420- 20:28.200* :  the taxes hide good change in everything, basically. A lot of things need to be fixed, the political
*20:28.200- 20:34.140* :  system, the poverty level. If those things are met, I think that's a comfortable place to stay.
*20:34.380- 20:40.060* :  The incumbent Rano Vikramasine is running for re-election, but his political future remains uncertain.
*20:40.880- 20:45.300* :  Tasked with steering Sri Lanka through a period of painful economic reforms,
*20:45.300- 20:52.260* :  he is largely seen as an ally of the previous government. A Marxist candidate, Anura Kumara
*20:52.260- 20:57.720* :  Dishanayaki, has emerged as an unlikely frontrunner, positioning himself as the voice of Sri
*20:57.720- 21:04.820* :  Lankan's working class. His nearest rival, Sajit Premadasa, won 42% of the vote in the last election.
*21:05.820- 21:11.380* :  Now he is relying on his promise to ease the tax burden on Sri Lankan's to secure a majority.
*21:15.080- 21:20.920* :  Shell's fardens are heavily populated areas, dwindling stocks of food and constant power outages.
*21:21.460- 21:26.240* :  The half a million people living in El Fashair, a city in Sudan's Darfur region,
*21:26.800- 21:31.360* :  have been at the center of the civil war for months now. There are reports of an upsurge in the
*21:31.360- 21:36.640* :  fighting at the moment, with the paramilitary rapid support forces pushing forward and the Sudanese
*21:36.640- 21:42.680* :  air force responding with war planes. Our Africa, regional editor, Will Ross gave me an update.
*21:43.280- 21:47.900* :  It is difficult to get news out because of communications problems, but there have been some
*21:47.900- 21:53.020* :  videos circulating, actually showing some of the fighting, now that there are malicious
*21:53.020- 21:58.680* :  that are allied to the Sudanese army, and they have been kind of celebrating in recent days
*21:59.340- 22:06.280* :  as they push back the rapid support forces, but it does seem that the RSF, this paramilitary force,
*22:06.320- 22:10.920* :  is just so determined to try and capture the city. They have been trying to do that for months,
*22:11.660- 22:17.540* :  and they are repeatedly shelling areas, and now according to a UN official sort of going
*22:17.540- 22:24.600* :  door-to-door combat as well inside the city, and they are talking about breaching some of the
*22:24.960- 22:30.440* :  defense positions of the Sudanese army and its allies, so it kind of feels as though the city is
*22:30.440- 22:37.080* :  under ever-increasing pressure, and of course lots of warnings of what may happen if the city
*22:37.080- 22:42.060* :  were to fall. I mean the world is watching the United Nations Secretary General Antony Gutereg
*22:42.060- 22:47.080* :  said it is gravely alarmed by these reports of a full scale assault on the city,
*22:47.640- 22:53.360* :  and yet what's going to stop the RSF, pressure on their backers, is it coming?
*22:53.360- 22:59.540* :  It doesn't seem so, I mean people have kind of talked around the issue, there is lots of evidence
*22:59.540- 23:05.460* :  that the United Arab Emirates have been backing the rapid support forces, something they deny,
*23:06.380- 23:14.080* :  but nobody's really spoken out to really call for the backers of the different sides to stop,
*23:14.080- 23:20.260* :  and any calls for a ceasefire, they've all been ignored, and once again we're hearing calls
*23:20.260- 23:27.340* :  from now the UN official in charge of preventing genocide, saying she's worried about what's going
*23:27.340- 23:33.020* :  to happen if the city falls and calling on the RSF to stop the assault, the same message from the
*23:33.020- 23:39.300* :  UN Secretary General, but who knows if anybody's listening? Will Ross. Saturday was World
*23:39.300- 23:45.320* :  Alzheimer's Day, the most common cause of dementia, which is a gradual decline in brain functioning.
*23:45.340- 23:52.000* :  It can affect memory, thinking skills, and other mental abilities. Over 55 million people worldwide
*23:52.000- 23:56.420* :  live with dementia, the majority of them in low and middle-income countries.
*23:57.440- 24:03.040* :  Krupa Paddy spoke to the journalist and science writer Antthea Rowan, who was written a book,
*24:03.040- 24:09.900* :  a silent tsunami swimming against the tide of my mother's dementia. She recalled the moment
*24:09.900- 24:15.500* :  her mother forgot she was her daughter. We were on holiday, and one evening I asked if she should
*24:15.500- 24:21.120* :  like a drink, yes she'd like a drink, I fetched her a cold beer, we sat down, and she sort of lent
*24:21.120- 24:28.080* :  in towards me, and she said to me, now tell me, when did we first meet? I really thought that she
*24:28.080- 24:33.500* :  was joking, I think I laughed, and it was clear that she wasn't joking, and she was a little
*24:33.500- 24:38.660* :  embarrassed then, and when I said, I'm your daughter, oh yes, yes of course you are. But the next morning
*24:38.660- 24:44.420* :  she'd obviously been fretting about this all night, and the next morning she flatly and furiously
*24:44.420- 24:51.240* :  refused that I was her daughter, and said that I must be lying, and I looked too old to be her daughter.
*24:51.880- 24:59.140* :  I collected photographs on my laptop as a sort of PowerPoint who's who to try to prove I was her
*24:59.140- 25:04.520* :  daughter, and lending context to that argument that I was her daughter, but she continued to attest
*25:04.520- 25:08.740* :  that I wasn't her daughter, to the point where I heard her checking with people on the phone,
*25:08.740- 25:14.600* :  I hear that Antthea is my daughter, you know I wish somebody had told me, so it wasn't just
*25:14.600- 25:20.760* :  the forgetting, but it was this completely skewed logic, that's a lot to process. It was, and my eldest
*25:20.760- 25:25.160* :  daughter said to me, how does it make you feel, but I wasn't really able to articulate how it made
*25:25.160- 25:32.620* :  me feel like I felt very very shocked, I felt very confused, I really felt at sea, I didn't know
*25:32.620- 25:37.320* :  what to feel, but you knew she had memory loss, so was it that you weren't anticipating this moment?
*25:37.520- 25:42.920* :  I didn't know that I memory loss was anything like that, she had had a stroke a few years previously,
*25:43.600- 25:48.400* :  and the doctors at the time said to us, there may be some transient memory loss, I have since
*25:48.400- 25:55.560* :  discovered that a stroke can cause dementia, and quite quickly after it in somebody who's elderly,
*25:56.300- 26:01.100* :  so I sort of blamed it on the stroke, I blamed it on the fact that she was elderly,
*26:02.020- 26:09.100* :  I blamed it on senior moments, I think it was a denial, denial in a total lack of education
*26:09.100- 26:16.320* :  about dementia, which is so important, and you also write about how you felt alienated, but that
*26:16.320- 26:21.520* :  was very different to your mother's relationship with your sister, and your granddaughter?
*26:21.600- 26:27.640* :  Yes, yes, yes, she knew all of them, she didn't want me, I had been dispensing all her
*26:27.640- 26:31.840* :  medications and helping her to bed every evening, she didn't want me to do that anymore, she closed
*26:31.840- 26:38.440* :  the door and said, no, no, my sister, Carol will help me, my daughter, Carol will help me,
*26:39.240- 26:44.380* :  I didn't feel angry or resentful that at anybody else that she did remember, I just
*26:44.800- 26:51.040* :  shocked and quite numb, I mean, you never, ever expect that a parent will forget you, and yet I
*26:51.040- 26:58.360* :  find it is incredibly common in dementia, how that forgetting happens, I think is different in
*26:58.360- 27:04.620* :  every case, and Anthony, you were very honest with your mom about her condition, and I wonder how
*27:04.620- 27:12.180* :  that played into the dynamic between the two of you? I was honest to a point, I only ever used the
*27:12.180- 27:19.540* :  word dementia with her once, and it caused such distress, I never did it again, because later on
*27:19.540- 27:24.120* :  she came to live with me, and she lived with me for 18 months before she died, and she would often
*27:24.120- 27:32.100* :  complain, oh my memory is so terrible, and I would, I said to her, oh mum, you know, you're old,
*27:32.100- 27:38.300* :  or we all forget the things, I tried to minimise it for her because she knew what that word meant
*27:38.300- 27:43.800* :  dementia, and I wasn't going to use it again, you also write that, forgetting is just the beginning,
*27:43.800- 27:49.700* :  yes, forgetting is just the beginning of dementia, and once I had lived with the condition for some
*27:49.700- 27:55.700* :  months, quite frankly, it's the least of it, it was the least of it in my case, in the end I didn't
*27:55.700- 28:01.960* :  matter that she had forgotten who I was, I didn't mind that towards the end I hated that she lost
*28:02.020- 28:06.920* :  her sense of taste, that it was one of the last things she was able to enjoy was food, so it was
*28:06.920- 28:13.240* :  one of the last things as her carer, that I could make a bit of a fuss over her meals, prepare
*28:13.240- 28:17.920* :  things for her, then she really enjoyed her life was so small by then, that if she could have one
*28:17.920- 28:22.900* :  meal that she really enjoyed, and really relished, I made it worth it, but when she couldn't taste,
*28:23.700- 28:29.860* :  I really hated that, and I hated her hallucinations and paranoia, they bought such fear to her.
*28:30.600- 28:33.240* :  Amthea Rowan, the journalist and author of the book,
*28:33.800- 28:37.400* :  a silent tsunami swimming against the tide of my mother's dementia.
*28:39.060- 28:43.320* :  700 NATO para-troopers have landed near the Dutch city of Arnhem,
*28:43.740- 28:49.040* :  part of events to mark the 80th anniversary of the Second World War Operation Market Garden.
*28:49.400- 28:53.300* :  This was an attempt by Allied troops to capture key bridges in the Netherlands,
*28:53.300- 28:58.700* :  which they hoped would pave the way for an assault on Nazi Germany, it failed.
*28:59.260- 29:02.120* :  Our correspondent Anna Holligan watched Saturday's commemoration.
*29:05.980- 29:12.060* :  10 of thousands of people gathered on Ginkyll Heath to witness a reenactment of what was one of
*29:12.060- 29:18.040* :  the bloodiest episodes of the Second World War. 700 para-troopers from several NATO nations,
*29:18.040- 29:24.340* :  including the UK, Poland and the USA, who were involved in the campaign, parachuted into the
*29:24.340- 29:29.280* :  fields, which saw some of the fiercest fighting. The cost has been heavy for both sides in this
*29:29.280- 29:34.540* :  hell spot in Arnhem. Further south, the Second Army has taken a large call of enemy prisoners,
*29:34.540- 29:38.860* :  but in spite of their successes, the British have been unable to force away through.
*29:39.160- 29:44.260* :  For Operation Market Garden, 35,000 airborne troops were dropped behind enemy lines
*29:44.820- 29:49.640* :  in an attempt to carve out a shortcut into Nazi Germany. It was thought that if the
*29:49.640- 29:54.620* :  Brigiet Arnhem could be taken, there was hope of an early invasion of Germany that might have
*29:54.620- 30:01.620* :  ended the war in December 1944, but after nine days of relentless fighting, a third of those
*30:01.620- 30:08.860* :  involved had either been taken prisoner or killed. Jeff Roberts is among the few surviving veterans
*30:08.860- 30:14.640* :  of Arnhem. We did our best, I didn't tell you, wasn't quite good enough to try.
*30:14.940- 30:23.420* :  I'm not here, I'm here, I'm here. Operation Market Garden may not have resulted in a military
*30:23.420- 30:28.620* :  victory, but is remembered for the courage and tenacity demonstrated by the Allied forces.
*30:29.140- 30:33.800* :  These commemorations aren't just about commemorating the past, but ensuring future generations
*30:33.800- 30:39.320* :  are conscious of how and by whom freedom was fought. Anahologin in the Netherlands.
*30:40.420- 30:45.220* :  Now to a decision in France that some are seeing as a victory in the fight against global warming,
*30:45.220- 30:52.020* :  others as an abuse of power. Officials in Paris have decided to give their 51,000 council workers
*30:52.920- 30:57.820* :  vegetarian meals twice a week in its canteens in a bid to be more eco-friendly.
*30:58.260- 30:59.720* :  Stephanie Prentice has this report.
*31:03.220- 31:08.000* :  Anyone listing French stereotypes when it comes to food would be quick to get to
*31:08.000- 31:14.420* :  dishes like steak-free, cocoa-van and cornblur. And the idea that French cuisine is synonymous
*31:14.420- 31:21.660* :  with meat or fish dishes is certainly backed by data. The average French person eats 120 kilograms
*31:21.660- 31:29.080* :  of meat every year compared to an EU average of 104, and those numbers may be about to go down.
*31:29.680- 31:34.860* :  Under a new scheme in Paris which has taken meat and fish off the menu for council workers
*31:34.860- 31:41.120* :  twice a week. My colleagues are very unhappy with the decision taken by the city,
*31:41.980- 31:44.880* :  especially for agents who work physically demanding jobs.
*31:44.880- 31:51.540* :  The workers unions are not happy. Patrick O'Frey is the spokesperson for the left-wing force
*31:51.540- 31:54.780* :  Ouvrier and says the plan is counterproductive.
*31:55.360- 32:00.560* :  I don't have any statistics, but I see many of my colleagues going to the nearby Boulangerie
*32:01.100- 32:06.920* :  instead to get a sandwich with meat, parmolouse. In this case, it is neither better for health
*32:06.920- 32:13.580* :  nor the environment. It was of course in Paris that the international treaty on climate change
*32:13.580- 32:19.700* :  was signed in 2016 pledging to minimize global warming with the livestock sector flagged as a
*32:19.700- 32:27.080* :  problem in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. But food historian Dr Annie Gray says eating meat is
*32:27.080- 32:32.860* :  deeply ingrained in French national identity. From a modern perspective, anyone who's travels
*32:32.860- 32:37.640* :  recently in France will know that outside Paris, vegetarian food is very hard to get hold of,
*32:37.940- 32:43.500* :  and it is regarded generally speaking as a kind of no-agraid of food. And from a historical point
*32:43.500- 32:48.580* :  of view, meat has always been very important. You know, you go back to the 16th century and beyond,
*32:48.660- 32:53.800* :  and you've got kings declaring that their role in life, that their purpose, is to put chicken
*32:53.800- 32:59.340* :  in everybody's pot. So far, Annie Dalgo, the mayor of Paris, maintains that dishes like broccoli
*32:59.340- 33:05.180* :  gratter will stay top of menu on Wednesdays and Fridays. And as for the workers, the BBC
*33:05.180- 33:11.740* :  spoke to outside one canteen, while some of them aren't happy, we need to have the choice to eat
*33:11.740- 33:19.240* :  what we want. It's a freedom. Others seem open to meat in the middle. I still eat meat the
*33:19.240- 33:23.800* :  rest of the days. It's just two days a week, so it's fine. If you want to make people change,
*33:23.860- 33:31.980* :  you have to force them in a way. Maybe it can make the mind change. So they won't be happy at first,
*33:32.040- 33:35.620* :  but I think it's a good thing. That report was by Stephanie Prentice.
*33:37.980- 33:42.040* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the global news podcast later.
