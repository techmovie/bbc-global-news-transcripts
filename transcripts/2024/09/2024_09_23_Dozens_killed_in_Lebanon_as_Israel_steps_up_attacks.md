*01:19.080- 01:22.300* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.540- 01:30.520* :  I'm Andrew Peach, and at 13 hours GMT on Monday, the 23rd of September, these are our main stories.
*01:31.260- 01:36.160* :  Lebanon says at least 180 people have been killed by Israeli attacks on Hezbollah
*01:36.160- 01:40.160* :  positions, making it the deadliest day in that conflict since last October.
*01:40.980- 01:45.960* :  People in Indian-administered Kashmir vote in local elections for the first time in a decade,
*01:46.700- 01:51.580* :  and a high-profile murder trial begins in Italy in a case which prompted protests around the
*01:51.580- 01:58.480* :  country. Also in this podcast, this is the Forkala, this is the White Friday.
*01:59.300- 02:06.580* :  It was an old lady that has several old vineyards, and we found more than one variety in these vineyards.
*02:07.080- 02:08.220* :  So it was a very good day.
*02:08.640- 02:11.600* :  How European winemakers are adapting to climate change.
*02:14.560- 02:18.280* :  The health authorities in Lebanon said at least 180 people have been killed,
*02:18.280- 02:22.520* :  and more than 700 wounded in Israeli air strikes near the southern border.
*02:23.120- 02:27.900* :  The Israeli army says it's targeted more than 300 positions, which it says as sites used by
*02:27.900- 02:33.140* :  the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah. Pictures on social media showed explosions and smoke
*02:33.140- 02:39.160* :  billowing from damaged buildings. Earlier, Israel warned people to move out of areas used by Hezbollah
*02:39.160- 02:44.480* :  after several days of cross-border bombardment. The Israeli Defence Minister Yov-Ghalan
*02:44.480- 02:47.680* :  vowed to continue fighting until the country's war goals were met.
*02:54.300- 02:59.400* :  The sequence of operations continues and will continue until we achieve our goals,
*02:59.400- 03:03.100* :  to return the residents of the north safely to their homes.
*03:03.600- 03:06.940* :  As Bela said, it had fired dozens of rockets towards northern Israel.
*03:06.940- 03:10.220* :  Israel Defence Forces said several have been shot down.
*03:10.880- 03:13.780* :  Ibrahim Nemner is Lebanese MP from the Progressive Left.
*03:13.780- 03:19.500* :  Speaking to the BBC, he accused Israel of violating international law with complete disregard
*03:19.500- 03:24.260* :  for civilian lives. The situation now is taking a different turn in Lebanon.
*03:24.260- 03:31.580* :  When Israel is starting to really disregard the civilian casualties and targeting civilians,
*03:31.800- 03:36.720* :  two days a few days ago, when they demolished the whole building because there were some Hezbollah
*03:36.720- 03:41.840* :  leaders meeting there, and tens of civilians were killed in that attack.
*03:42.220- 03:47.100* :  We are seeing more and more of this, and unfortunately, Israel is not taking into
*03:47.100- 03:50.280* :  conservation international law or the civilians in any regard.
*03:50.740- 03:53.920* :  Our correspondent, Rami Rahiam, is in the Lebanese capital Beirut.
*03:54.440- 04:01.460* :  We've just received words from the Lebanese Ministry of Health that so far 100 people have been
*04:01.460- 04:10.000* :  killed in this latest wave of Israeli attacks across the south and in areas of the Bicar.
*04:10.760- 04:16.320* :  100 people and according to the Ministry of Health among these are women, children,
*04:17.180- 04:25.340* :  and health workers who are trying also to provide the much needed aid to others in the region.
*04:25.340- 04:32.740* :  We also know that there have been large numbers of people trying to get from the south to Beirut
*04:33.560- 04:40.700* :  or just drive north away from these areas that are being bombed by the Israelis.
*04:42.100- 04:50.320* :  And essentially, the feeling is that this is a new round of escalation and it's edging
*04:50.900- 04:54.120* :  ever closer to a much wider confrontation.
*04:54.120- 04:59.860* :  We know people have been receiving text messages and voice messages today saying leave
*04:59.860- 05:05.560* :  your village if Hezbollah is present, basically, and it sounds as though people are
*05:05.560- 05:11.140* :  heeding that advice from the Israeli defense forces because they're taking their
*05:11.140- 05:15.220* :  children out of school. We know the traffic is very heavy. People are on the move.
*05:16.700- 05:19.640* :  Yes, they are on the move, but I don't think they're heeding the advice.
*05:19.640- 05:25.460* :  They are on the move because the bombing has actually started and quite possibly
*05:26.540- 05:32.740* :  the all of these messages are very widely seen as part of the psychological warfare,
*05:32.740- 05:38.400* :  but that does not mean that they are not true. People do understand that once Israel starts
*05:38.400- 05:45.780* :  sending messages like this, it's quite likely preparing to escalate its bombing campaign.
*05:45.780- 05:52.340* :  So people will move when they feel that a wave of bombing and air raids is about to come
*05:52.340- 06:01.280* :  their way and that's what's happening. These strikes are happening all across the border area.
*06:02.600- 06:08.580* :  The reports coming in quite a few hours ago were already saying that not one border village
*06:09.320- 06:13.720* :  escaped the first wave of bombing and it's going on.
*06:14.600- 06:19.360* :  Some people might have someone to go and stay with a friend or relative. If you don't have that,
*06:19.880- 06:26.240* :  where do you go? Right now the government has started opening schools to receive people who
*06:26.240- 06:31.940* :  don't have anywhere to go. Other people, as you mentioned, will try to go and stay with friends
*06:31.940- 06:37.140* :  and relatives in areas that are seen to be safer and which are in fact so far safer.
*06:38.060- 06:45.360* :  And also some people are trying to rent places to stay. So people are just trying to find
*06:46.060- 06:50.760* :  whatever shelter, whatever place they can away from the bombing.
*06:51.240- 06:56.320* :  That correspondent Rami Raheim with me from Beirut. Next to Sri Lanka where the
*06:56.320- 07:01.340* :  country's new president has been officially sworn in. Anurakamara Dishanayaka is a left-leaning
*07:01.340- 07:07.180* :  politician who promised voters good governance and measures to fight corruption. At his inauguration,
*07:07.180- 07:09.720* :  he promised a fresh start for all Sri Lankans.
*07:13.140- 07:17.580* :  We have a deep understanding that we have a challenging country. Our politics must be
*07:17.580- 07:23.280* :  cleaner than this. There is a need for a political culture that people expect. We will commit ourselves
*07:23.280- 07:27.500* :  to that. The public have a very negative view of politicians and politics.
*07:28.060- 07:32.560* :  So what can Sri Lankans expect from their new president? Here's our South Asia regional
*07:32.560- 07:39.340* :  editor and Barrasan Ethirajan. After taking over Mr. Anurakamara Dishanayaka has made it very
*07:39.340- 07:46.260* :  clear that he was not a magician to bring up immediate solutions to the massive economic crisis
*07:46.260- 07:53.500* :  the country is facing at the moment. He also said that Sri Lanka cannot remain in isolation from
*07:53.500- 08:00.440* :  the world because there were concerns about the winners left-wing economic policies and what
*08:00.440- 08:08.940* :  this will mean for the industries and privatization. So people are waking up to the reality of Marxist
*08:09.240- 08:14.760* :  a leftist party leader taking over the president of this country. People would say this as a tectonic
*08:14.760- 08:20.860* :  shift from the age-old politics of Sri Lanka where a few very traditional established political
*08:20.860- 08:27.020* :  parties and political denisties were dominating the Sri Lankan politics for more than 50 years.
*08:27.480- 08:33.980* :  So they're also waiting to see what kind of policies and announcements the new president is going
*08:33.980- 08:39.340* :  to make. You might say Mr. Dishanayaka has got a tough inheritance with the country and economic
*08:39.340- 08:44.180* :  crisis. You were there during the big protests a couple of years ago. Are we any indications yet
*08:44.180- 08:51.920* :  as to what are you going to do? One of the things a senior leader of his party told me on Sunday that
*08:51.920- 08:58.160* :  they want to renegotiate some of the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund which gave
*08:58.160- 09:06.100* :  a 2.9 billion dollar bailout package to Sri Lanka last year. Now that led to many austerity
*09:06.100- 09:12.620* :  measures. Taxes were hiked and many welfare programs, fundings were cut. So one of the first things
*09:12.620- 09:18.480* :  he wants to do is to alleviate the sufferings of the poor and the middle class people because of
*09:18.480- 09:25.400* :  these austerity measures. But the big challenge is the country has a 36 billion dollar foreign debt.
*09:25.820- 09:30.680* :  Now the government of Sri Lanka has been negotiating with both the international creditors and the
*09:30.680- 09:36.300* :  institutions for a debt restructuring. And that is a huge challenge how they are going to repay
*09:36.300- 09:42.980* :  this debt. An immediate priority is to bring down the cost of living, the prices of essential
*09:42.980- 09:49.120* :  commodities like food, fuel and utility bills. He has promised a lot during the campaign period,
*09:49.120- 09:55.900* :  but now he will know how difficult it is to manage the expectations of the people because people
*09:55.900- 09:59.640* :  have chosen them because they lost faith with the world political system.
*09:59.840- 10:05.160* :  I'm Barrison etharajan reporting. A murder trial begins in Italy today in a case which has
*10:05.160- 10:10.920* :  prompted protests around the country and changes to Italian law. Philippa Toretta has already
*10:10.920- 10:16.020* :  pleaded guilty to the killing, but the debate it provoked continues. Our Europe Regional Editor
*10:16.020- 10:23.100* :  Paul Moss explains. Julia Czekatine was a 22-year-old student in the city of Patua. Last year she was about
*10:23.100- 10:28.880* :  to graduate when she met up with her former boyfriend, Philippa Toretta. It seems he was having trouble
*10:28.880- 10:34.460* :  accepting their relationship was over, was trying to get her back. And when she said no on this
*10:34.460- 10:40.280* :  tire occasion, they had a row. According to reports of the autopsy, he stabbed her more than
*10:40.280- 10:46.380* :  70 times. He fled. His car was found there a week later in Germany when it ran out of petrol.
*10:46.380- 10:51.500* :  As you said, he quickly pleaded guilty. So the actual manhunt and the investigation were brief,
*10:52.180- 10:57.440* :  but the reaction was only just beginning. There were protests across. Italy demands for the changes
*10:57.440- 11:02.980* :  to the law and indeed changes were introduced. So the strong reaction that we've seen is about
*11:02.980- 11:08.100* :  the context of the number of women being attacked in Italy. Yeah, that's the interesting thing
*11:08.100- 11:12.900* :  isn't. I mean, why do some crimes seem to cut through? Protesters pointed out that, you know,
*11:12.900- 11:18.180* :  just how common murder of women is in Italy last year, just to give you an example, 120 women were
*11:18.180- 11:24.100* :  murdered, most of them by their partners or their ex-partners. This provoked a strong reaction.
*11:24.100- 11:29.160* :  Maybe it was the extreme violence of the killing. There were also the comments made by Julia's
*11:29.160- 11:33.160* :  older sister, Eleanor, which were widely publicized. She said, men who commit violence against
*11:33.160- 11:38.840* :  women are not monsters. They're not mentally ill. They are the natural result of patriarchal
*11:38.840- 11:44.460* :  attitudes and a culture of rape. Bear in mind also that Italy was just getting used to having
*11:44.460- 11:49.100* :  his first female prime minister. And Georgia Malone did speak out strongly against this crime.
*11:49.700- 11:53.720* :  And her governments introduced these new laws, toughening penalties for domestic violence,
*11:53.720- 11:58.380* :  strengthening restraining orders. And for once, this is one cross-party approval.
*11:58.880- 12:02.660* :  So from the wider issue back to the legal proceeding, what's expected to happen?
*12:03.060- 12:07.100* :  You know, I think the trial itself is going to be a bit of an anti-climax. He's pleaded guilty.
*12:07.100- 12:12.000* :  No one doubts he's going to get a very long prison sentence. What would be interesting,
*12:12.000- 12:17.600* :  though, is to see if coverage of the trial provokes more demands, renews those pushes for change.
*12:17.600- 12:22.000* :  Because what campaigners against violence against women say is that the new laws are welcome,
*12:22.040- 12:26.120* :  but they're not enough. They say the underlying attitudes remain there.
*12:26.920- 12:31.020* :  And I think this puts the prime minister, Georgia Malone, in an interesting position. She has
*12:31.480- 12:36.240* :  criticized violence against women. I don't think anyone doubts her genuine anger about the problem.
*12:36.900- 12:41.280* :  But she's also said again and again that Italy needs to return to its traditional values
*12:41.280- 12:45.940* :  of the strong family. And what some campaigners say is those traditional values are strong
*12:45.940- 12:49.900* :  family. Those are the values that say the man is in charge, not to be challenged,
*12:50.420- 12:54.960* :  that if he has to enforce his real with violence, well, sometimes that might be necessary.
*12:55.700- 12:57.680* :  You're a regional editor, Paul Moss.
*12:58.540- 13:03.440* :  Police in Tanzania have prevented a demonstration from taking place in Dara Salam,
*13:03.440- 13:07.220* :  after arresting several people, including two leading opposition figures.
*13:07.220- 13:11.900* :  The Kadema party had called the protests following allegations of political kidnappings
*13:11.900- 13:15.320* :  and murders. Florian Kajake reports from Dara Salam.
*13:25.220- 13:29.800* :  In the country's potency to Dara Salam, despite an official ban from the police,
*13:29.960- 13:34.120* :  the opposition is accusing President Samiya Sulohasan of returning the country to the
*13:34.120- 13:37.800* :  oppressive tactics Hovera predecesa John Magu Fuli. Mr. Boeh,
*13:37.960- 13:42.120* :  told journalists shortly before his arrest that the opposition was paying the full price of
*13:42.120- 13:47.660* :  democracy, but headed to show the way the party chairman turned up at the protest with his rota,
*13:47.880- 13:51.460* :  who was also arrested. Police had tightened security in Dara Salam overnight,
*13:51.700- 13:53.160* :  ahead of the planned demonstrations.
*13:54.320- 13:58.260* :  For the first time in 10 years, Indian-administered Kashmir is voting
*13:58.260- 14:02.560* :  in local assembly elections. It's a region which has lived through a violent
*14:02.560- 14:06.820* :  insurgency for decades and has always had a complex relationship with Delhi.
*14:07.380- 14:11.100* :  While some continue to boycott elections, there are others coming out to vote.
*14:11.700- 14:15.240* :  Let's find out what's changed and what Kashmiris want from these elections with our
*14:15.240- 14:17.400* :  India correspondent, Arundh Dei Mukherjee.
*14:25.320- 14:29.420* :  We're currently part of a convoy of Kashmiri politician Mr. Engineer Rashid,
*14:29.420- 14:35.900* :  heading to North Kashmir. His cavalcade is surrounded by supporters chanting his name and slogans
*14:35.900- 14:38.800* :  in his favor. They're saying the lion has come.
*14:41.880- 14:47.640* :  Engineer Rashid is promising change. An accused in a terror funding case and in jail for
*14:47.640- 14:51.600* :  the last five years, Rashid is now out on bail to campaign.
*14:54.240- 14:56.920* :  I spoke to him about his hopes for Jammu and Kashmir.
*14:58.860- 15:02.440* :  There are two things in my politics. One is to take care of the developed
*15:02.500- 15:08.720* :  government. The second is to take care of the country. You know it, the political issue
*15:08.960- 15:12.680* :  of Kashmir, there are explanations for the resolution to Kashmir issue.
*15:13.020- 15:15.220* :  So I want to carry both the things simultaneously.
*15:18.580- 15:23.980* :  He fought and won the general elections earlier this year despite being behind bars.
*15:25.220- 15:30.040* :  Rashid's campaign struck a chord with voters still reeling under the loss of
*15:30.040- 15:37.880* :  statured and autonomy five years ago. While speaking to me about what the people here have
*15:37.880- 15:43.060* :  gone through, he breaks down. I wish a day to come when there would be absolute peace,
*15:43.960- 15:51.160* :  but not that of a graveyard. But peace would really give sense of belonging to my people.
*15:52.440- 15:58.360* :  Since the 1990s, an armed insurgency against Indian rule has claimed thousands of lives,
*15:58.920- 16:04.840* :  including civilians and security forces. For decades, India has been accused of human rights
*16:04.840- 16:11.220* :  violations and cracking down on dissent. But in the last few years, critics say this has only
*16:11.220- 16:18.840* :  intensified. Voting in the recent general elections was a form of resistance.
*16:19.520- 16:23.940* :  Yem Modi talks about a new Kashmir. If new Kashmir means prizes will go up,
*16:23.940- 16:29.720* :  then we don't want new Kashmir. What exactly is the idea of development for them?
*16:29.780- 16:33.840* :  In the heart of the region's capital city, Shrinagar, I meet first-time voter,
*16:33.840- 16:41.700* :  24-year-old Malihar Sofi. She has decided not to vote because the elections for her hold little hope.
*16:42.300- 16:46.160* :  Peace in the region she says has come at the cost of personal liberties.
*16:46.160- 16:52.440* :  People don't speak like they used to against whatever was happening. But now we are not allowed to say so,
*16:52.640- 16:54.780* :  yeah, everything is peaceful because nobody speaks against them.
*16:57.140- 17:03.300* :  But the Bharati Ajanta Party says there is peace and the burden of conveying this message here
*17:03.780- 17:10.320* :  is on one prominent BJP face. We're in central Shrinagar and we've just arrived at the office
*17:10.320- 17:18.060* :  of engineer Ajaz BJP candidate. This is our achievement.
*17:18.060- 17:23.580* :  Elections have happened in the past too. But now, water turnout has increased.
*17:24.040- 17:27.020* :  Today, people are expressing their trust in democracy.
*17:29.840- 17:34.660* :  That's their pitch as the Hindu nationalist party tries to make inroads in a
*17:34.660- 17:38.060* :  Muslim majority region where it has never had much presence.
*17:39.020- 17:44.620* :  I'm in Shrinagar at a BJP rally walking alongside a combo of cars.
*17:45.280- 17:48.520* :  The cars are winding through roads with houses lined on both sides,
*17:49.180- 17:53.520* :  but as we've seen in other rallies, we usually see locals come out onto the roads,
*17:54.260- 17:59.060* :  trying to catch a glimpse of their local candidate, but that seems to be missing over here.
*17:59.960- 18:05.260* :  BJP is still seen here as the party responsible for taking away Kashmir's autonomy.
*18:06.140- 18:10.020* :  Its government in New Delhi blamed for crushing any dissent.
*18:10.600- 18:14.440* :  A charge, Ajaz, takes a hard line on while speaking to me.
*18:15.780- 18:20.840* :  Our country is a democrat. We won't allow terrorists to roam freely on our road.
*18:21.060- 18:22.920* :  We don't want a system of separatism.
*18:22.920- 18:25.520* :  All those people who are with separatists.
*18:25.940- 18:30.940* :  As Kashmiris go about their daily lives, they are also aware of another reality.
*18:31.460- 18:35.460* :  Even after a new government takes over in this federally administered region,
*18:36.120- 18:39.240* :  real power will remain in the hands of the centre.
*18:39.920- 18:42.600* :  Our India correspondent, Arun Jai Mukaji reporting.
*18:45.280- 18:46.400* :  Still to come in this podcast?
*18:46.600- 18:49.500* :  The messaging that we're getting currently is all about negativity.
*18:49.500- 18:51.240* :  It cuts its austerity.
*18:51.240- 18:52.080* :  It's fear of pain.
*18:52.080- 18:56.200* :  It's like my god, we've been through 14 years of austerity and pain and kind of cutbacks.
*18:56.500- 18:58.460* :  We need confidence, we need investment, we need growth.
*18:58.840- 19:03.360* :  What voters in Britain won from the governing Labour Party as it holds its annual conference.
*19:10.820- 19:13.860* :  Explaining football to the friend who's just there for the nachos?
*19:14.380- 19:14.640* :  Hard.
*19:15.340- 19:19.000* :  Tailgating from home like a pro with snacks and drinks everyone will love,
*19:19.540- 19:20.400* :  any easy win.
*19:20.820- 19:24.040* :  And with Instacart helping deliver the snack time MVP's to your door,

*19:42.620- 19:46.580* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*19:46.840- 19:49.240* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*19:49.560- 19:53.160* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*19:53.160- 19:56.960* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*19:57.220- 20:02.220* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*20:16.360- 20:19.780* :  Two recent security breaches surrounding the former President Donald Trump,
*20:19.780- 20:23.800* :  including one which resulted in a failed assassination attempt in Pennsylvania,
*20:23.800- 20:29.780* :  have sparked a whole new world of disinformation and hate online ahead of November's US election.
*20:30.480- 20:34.100* :  For a new BBC Sound series called Why Do You Hate Me USA?
*20:34.700- 20:37.340* :  The BBC's disinformation and social media correspondent,
*20:37.340- 20:39.540* :  Mariana Spring, has been to Colorado.
*20:39.540- 20:43.380* :  A state which has become a hotbed for conspiracy theories like this,
*20:43.380- 20:48.160* :  to investigate how two people, one who plans to vote Republican and the other Democrat,
*20:48.560- 20:50.820* :  have been drawn into evidence-free theories.
*20:51.720- 20:54.820* :  So I think a lot of this can start with genuine questions that people have.
*20:55.000- 20:55.960* :  How could this have happened?
*20:55.960- 20:59.440* :  There were lots of allegations of security failings, for example,
*20:59.440- 21:04.320* :  the head of the Secret Service in the United States actually resigned after that assassination attempt
*21:04.760- 21:06.400* :  that happened in July in Pennsylvania.
*21:07.240- 21:08.820* :  So it often begins with that.
*21:08.820- 21:12.520* :  But then there's this next step and it is being exposed to
*21:13.720- 21:17.240* :  baseless, unevidence theories about what has really gone on.
*21:17.340- 21:19.520* :  I think some of it is just as human beings.
*21:19.520- 21:22.800* :  We are looking for a reason and an answer and an explanation.
*21:23.420- 21:26.960* :  When it comes to the assassination attempt that happened in July,
*21:26.960- 21:31.020* :  we still are pretty unclear on what the motives of that shooter were.
*21:31.020- 21:35.140* :  That leaves a lot of questions and then conspiracy theories, speculation, false claims,
*21:35.140- 21:40.820* :  filled that void and the one that filled that void, the loudest or the most, was this
*21:41.960- 21:46.440* :  unevidence idea that this had somehow been staged, the shooting that happened in July.
*21:46.800- 21:52.880* :  Now you spoke to someone about why she believes it was staged and even why she perhaps wants to
*21:52.880- 21:57.140* :  believe it was staged. Yeah, it was really interesting. So I was out in Colorado.
*21:57.220- 22:02.420* :  Colorado is a state that has become a bit of a hotbed for conspiracy theories because
*22:03.480- 22:08.640* :  it was a place where some of the false claims about the election being stolen in 2020 proliferated.
*22:09.120- 22:16.980* :  And I met two different women there. One who is what you might call an experienced believer
*22:16.980- 22:22.100* :  of conspiracy theories. She's someone who has often posted about natural medicine and
*22:23.180- 22:28.100* :  her lifestyle. She's called Wild Mother on social media. But more recently she started posting
*22:28.540- 22:32.640* :  unproven theories about what's going on behind the headlines. And so when the shooting
*22:32.640- 22:37.260* :  happened, she found herself going down what we often call the rabbit hole to try and get more answers.
*22:38.120- 22:42.800* :  And she was exposed to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which for people who haven't heard of it,
*22:42.840- 22:48.360* :  is a sprawling conspiracy theory that suggests Donald Trump is waging a secret war against
*22:48.660- 22:55.820* :  a powerful cabal of people. And in her mind, this or rather what she saw online and what she wanted
*22:55.820- 23:02.340* :  to believe was that this had been set up by Trump's own team in order to frame the deep state.
*23:02.800- 23:07.940* :  I hope it is, you know, I really do. Why? Because I think our country needs rescuing from our
*23:07.940- 23:13.460* :  government right now. It's a horrible mess. It seems to me that once you get into this way of
*23:13.460- 23:17.640* :  looking at the world and thinking about it, it's almost like fundamentally changes the way you
*23:17.640- 23:23.820* :  observe like every event like from the assassination attempt to 9-11. It's like going to a magic show
*23:23.820- 23:27.760* :  as a kid and then that you find out for the first time that the magician is pulling one over on you.
*23:28.260- 23:30.740* :  Now every time you go to a magic show, you know what they're doing.
*23:31.580- 23:36.100* :  What's perhaps the most interesting is someone like Wild Mother has been thinking in that way for
*23:36.100- 23:40.640* :  quite a while. Whereas the other woman I met Camille, she's voted Democrat for the past 15 years.
*23:40.920- 23:45.980* :  She's never believed anything had been staged before in this way. And yet she was also
*23:45.980- 23:52.000* :  pushed this stuff on her social media feeds and drawn into a world where these things she'd been
*23:52.000- 23:57.100* :  so opposed to could actually possibly be true. Now you also talked to people who run the elections
*23:57.580- 24:01.920* :  in Colorado about the kind of threats they've been having. Yeah and I think it's important to
*24:01.940- 24:05.980* :  understand the link in some ways between people believing that an assassination attempt could be
*24:05.980- 24:11.540* :  staged contrary to the evidence and people believing that anything could be staged or rigged
*24:11.660- 24:16.500* :  and that includes elections and that's where the election workers come in. So that erosion of trust
*24:17.760- 24:22.140* :  institutions and in the people who are tasked with protecting and upholding those institutions
*24:22.260- 24:27.780* :  is part of the problem here. I went to Jefferson County and I got to go inside the election building
*24:28.340- 24:32.300* :  where I met several of the people who worked there including the county clerk Amanda Gonzalez and
*24:32.300- 24:38.180* :  also one of her employees, Quang. And they spoke about how rather than it easing up after the 2020
*24:38.180- 24:43.300* :  election, it's feeling a whole lot scarier for them and they're having to think a lot about security.
*24:43.760- 24:49.000* :  I think as an election worker, we are kind of the front lines, right? You know post the results
*24:49.000- 24:57.620* :  of 2020. Myself and my colleagues have been targeted with harassment, accusations of us doing
*24:57.620- 25:04.300* :  the various things. I don't tell a lot of the public that I'm in elections unless the conversation
*25:04.300- 25:09.500* :  drives it that way. I generally tell just you know random strangers that I'm just in IT.
*25:10.360- 25:15.960* :  And you can listen to the first two episodes of Why Do You Hate Me USA on BBC Sounds or Wherever You
*25:15.960- 25:20.860* :  Get Your BBC Podcasts. Each week, Mariana is going to be investigating how a different
*25:20.860- 25:25.400* :  phenomenon unfolding on social media is shaping November's presidential election.
*25:26.540- 25:31.080* :  Britain's governing Labour Party is holding its annual conference this week in the city of Liverpool.
*25:31.760- 25:36.020* :  But why do you mind if I expected a celebration of its landslide win in July's election?
*25:36.460- 25:40.840* :  That's been tarnished by negative headlines about gifts to senior party figures,
*25:41.280- 25:45.280* :  just as the same politicians announce a cut to universal fuel allowances for all,
*25:45.280- 25:49.700* :  but the poorest old age pensioners. And other criticisms have been raised,
*25:49.700- 25:54.480* :  shortly after the Chancellor or Finance Minister Rachel Reeves took to the stage to thank
*25:54.480- 25:59.600* :  Labour voters, a protestor stood up and criticised the government over the environment and arms
*25:59.600- 26:07.140* :  sales to Israel. I will repay the trust that people put in us. Trust is hard earned,
*26:08.080- 26:15.580* :  but it's easily squandered. Just ask the Conservatives. They paid the price for their incompetence,
*26:15.760- 26:18.300* :  their dishonesty and their rule breaking.
*26:18.820- 26:25.000* :  We are still selling arms in Israel. I know who opposed it to any French law, but I don't
*26:25.000- 26:30.420* :  think I know who opposed it. That heckler was forcibly removed from the hall.
*26:30.420- 26:33.060* :  Our political correspondent Rob Watson's in Liverpool.
*26:33.600- 26:38.300* :  I mean, in many ways Andrew enabled her to trot out the line Labour uses in these circumstances,
*26:38.300- 26:43.180* :  which is a hard like all those left-wing parties. We used to be a partist of protest,
*26:43.660- 26:46.440* :  party of protest, but now we're a party of serious government.
*26:47.600- 26:53.320* :  What else did she have to say in terms of economic messaging? Nothing terribly new today, I don't
*26:53.320- 26:57.580* :  think. It's interesting you put it that way, Andrew. I don't think we learned a vast amount
*26:57.580- 27:01.900* :  if anything about Britain's macroeconomic policy under this new Labour government.
*27:02.420- 27:06.540* :  What she was trying to do though in the short term was this incredibly difficult balance between
*27:07.180- 27:11.440* :  saying to the country and to the world, look, we're going to be fiscally responsible. The
*27:11.440- 27:14.640* :  Conservative government left us in a mess. We're going to try and balance the books,
*27:15.220- 27:20.160* :  but because there's been all this criticism that my goodness, Keir Starmer and Rachel Rees have
*27:20.160- 27:24.640* :  been too gloomy to say. But once we've got everything settled, you know, once Britain is on a firm
*27:24.640- 27:29.300* :  financial footing, don't worry, it's going to be fabulous. Life in here is great. We've got lots
*27:29.300- 27:33.400* :  of entrepreneurs. People are going to be building stuff. So it was trying to strike that balance
*27:33.400- 27:38.600* :  between saying, yes, we're going to be responsible, but don't worry, there is a brighter future ahead.
*27:39.120- 27:43.260* :  A bit stage managed these events. You were certainly getting lots of clapping cheering,
*27:43.260- 27:47.100* :  standing ovation, all of that. What's the mood light behind the scenes in Liverpool?
*27:47.920- 27:53.620* :  A bit stage managed as being generous, Andrew. I mean, these party conferences are incredibly
*27:53.620- 27:59.240* :  stage managed and all designed to sort of improve the mood of journalists and of activists and
*27:59.240- 28:03.920* :  try and send a message out to the country that you're united. I mean, the mood of activists
*28:03.920- 28:10.360* :  is a mix of absolutely celebration after being back in power after 14 years in the wilderness.
*28:10.940- 28:16.540* :  But there has been concern among activists about the kind of political stumbles, the lack of
*28:16.540- 28:20.880* :  judgment as they would see it that Keir Starmer and others have made. And also, I suppose,
*28:21.440- 28:26.920* :  more profoundly than that, a sort of a nagging doubt, you know, can labour really turn around
*28:26.920- 28:32.720* :  the British economy given the sort of headwinds it faces given the deficit that it has, the dead it
*28:32.720- 28:37.980* :  has like so many other western nations and the forecasts of rather anemic growth. So people are
*28:38.280- 28:42.540* :  yes celebrating but thinking, good and gracious, we do have a tough road ahead.
*28:42.800- 28:48.580* :  I'll correspond on Rob Watson in Liverpool. September is usually harvest time for some of Europe's major
*28:48.580- 28:54.660* :  wine producers, but they've seen their yields hard hit by climate change while new wine regions
*28:54.660- 28:59.660* :  are emerging with better growing conditions. For traditional wine regions, droughts and rising
*28:59.660- 29:05.000* :  temperatures pose a big challenge. Sophie Eastor from the BBC's Climate Question Podcast
*29:05.000- 29:09.580* :  has been to Catalonia in eastern Spain to see how one wine maker is adapting.
*29:13.820- 29:19.820* :  We are in Masla Blana at Bignare, so here we have very, very all vines.
*29:20.600- 29:26.840* :  Giuseppe Sabaric is the chief wine maker at Familiar Torres, one of the oldest family wine
*29:26.840- 29:35.260* :  companies in Spain. The family has been making wine here since 1870, but now it's facing a huge
*29:35.260- 29:43.400* :  challenge. We have a big drought period having half yield in the vineyards as average in the area.
*29:43.400- 29:48.320* :  Wow, so you have half as many grapes grown as a normal year?
*29:48.440- 29:54.340* :  Yes, because when the drought periods are too long another thing appears that was unexpected in
*29:54.340- 29:58.140* :  the area, I never seen that, is the death of the plants.
*30:01.480- 30:06.640* :  For the grapes that do survive, higher temperatures mean they ripen two weeks earlier,
*30:07.220- 30:10.260* :  and that affects the taste and character of the wine.
*30:10.600- 30:18.180* :  The aromas are evolving from fresh or green fruit to ripe and then over ripe and jammy fruits.
*30:18.520- 30:22.700* :  You have more sugar in the grapes, so more sugar means more alcohol in the wines.
*30:23.780- 30:29.660* :  A recent study found that 90% of traditional wine regions in lowland Spain,
*30:29.660- 30:36.560* :  Greece, Italy and southern California could disappear by the end of this century if they don't adapt.
*30:37.580- 30:43.500* :  The Torres family have started planting grapes at altitude to get away from the scorching heat.
*30:44.280- 30:49.520* :  We have been producing grapes in the pyrrines at 1,000 meters.
*30:51.000- 30:56.380* :  If you go up the temperatures are very low comparing to here, so that's good for the plants.
*30:57.040- 31:00.240* :  In a test vineyard I saw one of their other strategies.
*31:01.200- 31:09.680* :  In the early 19th century a disease called phyloxera came from the USA and destroyed most of the native grapefines across Europe,
*31:10.320- 31:11.740* :  including here in Catalonia.
*31:12.680- 31:15.900* :  Most people thought they were lost forever, until now.
*31:17.180- 31:22.780* :  Sometimes we find just one old find, sometimes we find a small plantation,
*31:23.700- 31:26.820* :  and sometimes it's in the middle of the forest in the tree.
*31:27.200- 31:31.280* :  Mireia Torres is part of the family's 5th generation of wine makers.
*31:32.140- 31:37.440* :  Using announcements in the local press, she's been leading a grape hunt across the region.
*31:44.160- 31:49.700* :  Mireia's found 60 varieties so far, some of which are more resistant to drought
*31:50.200- 31:53.420* :  and ripen later, which helps with higher temperatures.
*31:54.520- 31:58.340* :  She hopes there'll be the climate-proof wines of the future.
*31:58.600- 32:01.440* :  And this is the forcada, this is the white variety.
*32:02.280- 32:09.600* :  It was an old lady that has several old vineyards, and we found more than one variety in these vineyards.
*32:10.100- 32:11.200* :  So it was a very good day.
*32:12.660- 32:20.760* :  Finding the vine is just the start of a long 12-year process to get it checked for viruses and officially approved.
*32:23.820- 32:29.720* :  As the world warms, you might start noticing more unfamiliar grape varieties on the market,
*32:30.220- 32:33.100* :  as places like Spain try to keep the wine flowing.
*32:33.720- 32:36.120* :  The good news is, they taste pretty good.
*32:37.780- 32:42.140* :  That from Sophie Eustor, you can hear more on that on the Climate Question Podcast,
*32:42.620- 32:45.980* :  either on BBC Sounds or wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*32:47.000- 32:51.620* :  However busy your day is, what would you do if you came across a defenseless animal?
*32:51.620- 32:57.320* :  A new book called Raising Hair tells the tale of a busy political adviser in the UK
*32:57.320- 33:02.880* :  who says her former city life was changed when she took in an abandoned baby hair.
*33:03.220- 33:04.740* :  Stephanie Prentice takes up the story.
*33:11.280- 33:15.440* :  For Chloe Dalton, that sound of a hair drumming its feet on a cushion
*33:15.800- 33:18.300* :  soon became the soundtrack to her days.
*33:19.100- 33:24.900* :  It was during one of the Covid lockdowns and one of her daily walks that she spotted a baby hair
*33:24.900- 33:26.200* :  lying on the ground.
*33:26.840- 33:31.100* :  I instinctively initially left it because I assumed that its mother was nearby,
*33:31.100- 33:36.540* :  but it was in a very exposed position within sight of predators with passing cars in the middle of
*33:36.540- 33:42.400* :  a track. So after four or five hours, I came back and I brought it in with the expectation
*33:42.500- 33:45.000* :  that I would actually return it to the field at nightfall.
*33:45.380- 33:47.780* :  But a conservationist explained to me that that would be impossible.
*33:47.780- 33:50.740* :  It would smell of me and its mother if she was still alive would reject it.
*33:50.920- 33:54.240* :  Chloe wanted the hair to live but not as a pet.
*33:54.260- 34:00.660* :  She didn't cage it or even name it, assuming when it was strong enough it would return to the wild.
*34:01.440- 34:05.280* :  That day soon came, but it didn't turn out as she expected.
*34:05.840- 34:10.700* :  One day when it was a few months old, it learnt to leap through the garden wall and I thought
*34:10.700- 34:16.500* :  it was gone forever and in fact it wasn't, it came back and for over three years this
*34:16.800- 34:20.760* :  beautiful creature has leapt over the garden wall every morning and come to sleep in the house.
*34:20.760- 34:25.560* :  It's not tame or domesticated, but it's found this balance it lives alongside humans.
*34:25.660- 34:30.540* :  To the extent that she actually gave birth to leverits in my house.
*34:31.040- 34:36.820* :  Now this blended family lived together with generations of leverits visiting Chloe's garden.
*34:36.820- 34:44.220* :  The doors are always open and the original hair always returns often to sleep under Chloe's desk.
*34:44.540- 34:51.560* :  Keggy Crew is an expert in animal behavior and the author of beastly the epic 40,000 year story
*34:51.560- 34:57.820* :  of animals and us. She says her populations are in decline and that makes stories like this
*34:57.860- 35:04.940* :  all the more important. To be able to use that experience to take it further into the bigger
*35:04.940- 35:11.160* :  wider world where the existential threat of losing animals is I think that the real lesson
*35:11.620- 35:17.540* :  in this whole story that actually animals can save us but first we have to save them.
*35:17.780- 35:23.220* :  In the book Chloe does say the hair saved her giving her a new perspective on life.
*35:23.780- 35:27.300* :  I've had this extraordinary opportunity to live alongside a family of wild animals.
*35:27.820- 35:31.500* :  The experience had a huge impact on me in terms of reconnecting me to nature,
*35:31.500- 35:35.220* :  teaching me to see nature, hear nature feel nature completely differently.
*35:36.140- 35:37.840* :  That report from Stephanie Prentice.
*35:39.940- 35:43.620* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
