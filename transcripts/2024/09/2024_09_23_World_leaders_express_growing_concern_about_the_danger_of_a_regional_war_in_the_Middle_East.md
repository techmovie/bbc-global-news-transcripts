*01:19.680- 01:24.220* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Monday the 23rd of September, these are our main stories.
*01:24.820- 01:29.860* :  World leaders are expressing growing concern about the dangers of a regional war in the Middle East.
*01:30.340- 01:34.740* :  Sri Lanka's presidential election has been won by a left-wing anti-corruption candidate,
*01:35.300- 01:37.240* :  Anura Kumara Desanayaka.
*01:37.860- 01:41.340* :  Voting in regional elections in the German state of Brandenburg
*01:41.620- 01:46.120* :  has ended with provisional results showing Chancellor Olaf Schultz's social democrats
*01:46.540- 01:49.300* :  a slightly ahead of the far-right AFD.
*01:49.620- 01:54.900* :  Also in this podcast, we meet the man who discovered this.
*02:03.420- 02:07.500* :  An unknown piece by one of the world's greatest composers, find out who later.
*02:12.000- 02:13.400* :  We begin in the Middle East.
*02:14.080- 02:18.880* :  Both Israel and Husbala have threatened to intensify their cross-border attacks.
*02:19.640- 02:23.200* :  As fears grow that the worsening violence could erupt into an all-out war.
*02:23.760- 02:28.080* :  The two sides are exchanging heavy rocket fire which has killed at least three people in Lebanon
*02:28.080- 02:31.520* :  and sent hundreds of thousands of Israelis to bomb shelters.
*02:32.120- 02:37.620* :  Husbala says the confrontation has entered a new phase becoming an open-ended battle of reckoning.
*02:38.280- 02:44.100* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists his troops landed a series of blows on the
*02:44.100- 02:48.900* :  group and warns that if it hasn't got the message, yes, then it will.
*02:49.620- 02:53.780* :  President Joe Biden says the United States will do everything in its power to prevent an
*02:53.780- 02:58.460* :  escalation of the conflict. Egypt had already warned that intensifying
*02:58.460- 03:04.620* :  fighting between Israel and Lebanon's Iranian-backed Husbala risks igniting a regional conflict.
*03:05.340- 03:10.640* :  Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams, who's in Jerusalem, sent this report on Sunday's developments.
*03:12.940- 03:17.680* :  In Curiat Bialek, on the outskirts of Haifa, bulldozers have been clearing rubble all day.
*03:19.080- 03:23.820* :  A town hit for the first time in almost 20 years by rockets fired from inside Lebanon.
*03:26.120- 03:29.840* :  Smoke pours from a gutted building, car's lying mangled in the road.
*03:30.320- 03:32.080* :  Akhir Itzraqi lives nearby.
*03:40.480- 03:45.160* :  The war's in alarm and then immediately after the war, it be explosion.
*03:45.160- 03:50.440* :  By lunchtime, Husbala had launched more than 150 rockets and drones across the border.
*03:50.920- 03:54.680* :  Pro-Iranian militia groups in Iraq said they had fired missiles too.
*03:55.460- 03:57.820* :  The army said most were intercepted, but some,
*03:57.820- 04:01.120* :  Husbala rockets landed much further into Israel than before.
*04:01.120- 04:06.160* :  The north of the country remains on high alert, with schools closed, hospitals moving
*04:06.180- 04:09.260* :  under ground and public gatherings restricted.
*04:12.720- 04:17.600* :  Across the border, Israeli jets have kept up a relentless bombardment, striking hundreds of
*04:17.600- 04:21.860* :  targets across southern Lebanon. Israel says it's hitting his baller's infrastructure,
*04:22.220- 04:23.780* :  and especially its rocket launchers.
*04:26.300- 04:29.920* :  As you watch us from Beirut, Diala says the people of Lebanon don't want war,
*04:29.920- 04:33.060* :  but in the end she says we're not the ones making decisions.
*04:33.060- 04:36.360* :  With its aerial bombardment, strikes on senior commanders,
*04:36.360- 04:40.140* :  and presumed booby trapping of thousands of pages and walkie-talkies,
*04:40.520- 04:43.800* :  Israel has dramatically escalated its war on Hezbollah.
*04:44.140- 04:47.880* :  The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning delivered a stern warning.
*04:51.700- 04:56.860* :  In the last few days, we inflicted on Hezbollah a sequence of blows that it did not imagine.
*04:57.440- 05:02.360* :  If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you it will understand the message.
*05:03.680- 05:08.560* :  Israel, he said, was determined to return 60,000 displaced civilians to their homes close to
*05:08.560- 05:13.620* :  the border. For now at least, Hezbollah seems equally determined to stop that from happening.
*05:14.100- 05:18.900* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem, or with tensions in the Middle East, showing no signs of cooling,
*05:19.380- 05:23.120* :  our international editor Jeremy Bowen considers where the region is heading.
*05:23.780- 05:29.840* :  Israel's offensive against Hezbollah with airstrikes assassinations and the audacious weaponization
*05:29.840- 05:36.700* :  of pages and radios is designed to change the balance of power in the border war, forcing
*05:36.700- 05:43.720* :  Hezbollah to stop firing into Israel. Without question, Israel has inflicted severe blows on its
*05:43.720- 05:49.860* :  enemy in Lebanon, which limit its capacity to go on the offensive, but they will not be enough
*05:49.860- 05:54.920* :  to make it comply. Fighting Israel is deep in Hezbollah's DNA.
*05:54.920- 06:02.180* :  Its arsenal is largely intact, its attacks continue, and its leader Hassan Nasrallah has promised
*06:02.180- 06:09.520* :  retaliation. Israel's next steps might include a ground offensive, sending troops and tanks
*06:09.520- 06:15.700* :  into Lebanon. It has reinforced units on the border, and well-informed former generals assess
*06:15.700- 06:22.480* :  there is a strong chance it might happen. The rapid escalation driven by the Israelis since the
*06:22.480- 06:28.720* :  Pager attack is why Israel's allies as well as its enemies are preparing for the worst.
*06:29.720- 06:35.440* :  Nothing has happened in the last few days to slow down the slide into a much bigger war.
*06:36.140- 06:41.980* :  The US and UK among many others insist that only diplomacy can cool this crisis,
*06:42.840- 06:49.620* :  but without a ceasefire in Gaza their hands are tied, and it's not clear who is listening to them.
*06:50.200- 06:56.360* :  Jeremy Bowen, in a separate development, the news organization Al Jazeera has accused Israel's
*06:56.360- 07:02.240* :  armed forces of committing a criminal act when they raided its offices in the occupied West Bank.
*07:02.240- 07:08.960* :  It's been closed for an initial period of 45 days. The Qatari-owned television network
*07:08.960- 07:14.860* :  aired dramatic live footage showing heavily armed Israeli soldiers entering its bureau in Ramallah,
*07:15.160- 07:20.160* :  an ordering journalist to stop work and leave the office immediately. Israel says it took the
*07:20.160- 07:25.240* :  measures because Al Jazeera is guilty of incitement and of supporting terrorism. The Israeli
*07:25.240- 07:29.580* :  government had previously shut down Al Jazeera's offices in East Jerusalem.
*07:31.600- 07:38.120* :  He calls himself the voice of the working class, and now Anora Kumar Dishanayaka has become
*07:38.120- 07:44.540* :  Sri Lanka's new president. Mr Dishanayaka campaigned on a promise to implement anti-corruption
*07:44.740- 07:50.560* :  two years after street protests forced the then president to flee the country. He's largely seen
*07:50.560- 07:56.120* :  as the candidate of change who's managed to break Sri Lanka's political dynasty. Samira Hussain
*07:56.120- 08:02.660* :  spoke to me from the Sri Lankan capital, Colombia. It was at the election commission office that he
*08:02.660- 08:09.240* :  was pronounced officially as president, and you know you have to think that this was a candidate
*08:09.840- 08:16.680* :  that came up as an unlikely frontrunner. He's not new to politics, but he's certainly someone
*08:16.680- 08:23.200* :  who's been able to capitalize on the anger of Sri Lankans. Very angry at what happened
*08:23.200- 08:29.140* :  with regards to the crushing economic crisis that was largely due to decades of financial
*08:29.140- 08:34.840* :  mismanagement here in Sri Lanka. So he really capitalized on that. And the sense from Sri
*08:34.840- 08:42.200* :  Lankans that they really want some kind of change. Now for so many years politics in this country has
*08:42.200- 08:49.160* :  really been dominated by one political family, the Rajabaksas, and he really positioned himself as
*08:49.160- 08:55.780* :  a candidate who is so far from that political dynasty that you could trust him with trying to
*08:55.780- 09:01.280* :  rebuild the country. Change is easy to promise hard to deliver, isn't it? Particularly with regards
*09:01.280- 09:04.520* :  to the economy. You'll have to tie the line with the international lenders, Wendy.
*09:05.320- 09:11.500* :  Right. I mean, you can't go and renegotiate a lot of the debt that the country is under. Look,
*09:11.500- 09:19.300* :  it has $92 billion in debt, and that's including both national and foreign debt. And there have been
*09:19.300- 09:25.300* :  some pretty intense austerity measures put in place by the International Monetary Fund, where
*09:25.300- 09:31.040* :  the lot of the money has come from for Sri Lanka. One of the things that, you know,
*09:31.040- 09:38.100* :  proponents of the IMF would say is that, look, they don't ever institute the kinds of measures that
*09:38.100- 09:43.000* :  they don't believe that the country can take. And although there is quite a lot of pressure on
*09:43.000- 09:50.920* :  every day Sri Lankans who are dealing with higher taxes and stagnant wages, it is a bit of something
*09:50.920- 09:56.240* :  that the country has to bear because of just how many dollars in debt they are.
*09:56.960- 10:03.940* :  Samir Ossin in Colombia there. Next to Germany and the provisional result from a key regional
*10:03.940- 10:09.660* :  election in the country is put in the governing social democrat party narrowly ahead of the far
*10:09.660- 10:16.240* :  right AFD. Brandenburg in the country's northeast has traditionally been seen as safely in social
*10:16.240- 10:22.480* :  democrat hands, but two regional elections earlier this month saw major gains for the far right.
*10:22.480- 10:27.980* :  And Sunday's vote was being viewed as a crucial test of the anti-immigrant parties fortunes.
*10:28.400- 10:33.580* :  The state premier, Dismar Voitka, emphasized the significance of the vote.
*10:35.960- 10:41.900* :  We said that we would face this fight, and therefore it was our aim from the very beginning
*10:41.940- 10:49.800* :  to stop our country getting a big, brown stamp. It seems that once again, as so often in history,
*10:49.800- 10:54.880* :  it was the social democrats who stopped extremists on their way to power.
*10:57.500- 11:01.960* :  I heard more from our correspondent Mark Lowen in Berlin on the SPD's success.
*11:02.660- 11:06.760* :  It's a very narrow way actually. I'm at the party election headquarters of the AFD,
*11:07.000- 11:11.140* :  and they actually let out cheers when the results came out. I mean, that was hiding
*11:11.140- 11:15.440* :  their disappointment to some extent, but also showing the extent to which the party has risen,
*11:15.440- 11:22.060* :  because I can give you the final results that have just come through. And the SPD has 30.7%
*11:22.340- 11:30.580* :  of the votes, and the AFD at 29.6%, so just over 1% between them. It is a narrow victory,
*11:31.380- 11:35.940* :  one which the SPD will savor and provide some respite for Olaf Scholz,
*11:36.400- 11:40.340* :  given the fact that there were increasing calls for him to step aside ahead of federal elections
*11:40.340- 11:45.200* :  next year. And if the SPD had lost Brandenburg, which is a state which it has ruled since
*11:45.200- 11:50.420* :  German reunification in 1990, I think it could have proved fatal for him. Perhaps those calls will,
*11:51.640- 11:55.520* :  if not for silent, they will perhaps be slightly quieter over the next few days,
*11:55.520- 12:02.320* :  but the AFD has come within almost a percentage of victory. And so it is another sign of how the far
*12:02.320- 12:07.880* :  right has really soared in this country. I mean, it now has in the space of a month. There's one
*12:07.880- 12:12.960* :  in one region election in Therinjan come a close second into others, and shows to some extent that
*12:12.960- 12:17.780* :  the old political order in this country, and as it is in much of Europe, is crumbling. The AFD
*12:17.780- 12:23.520* :  has capitalized on voter discontent with integration. That was to topping the polls in terms of the
*12:23.520- 12:28.080* :  number one issue for voters. It capitalized on anger, about immigration, capitalized on people's
*12:28.080- 12:32.300* :  anger, about the cost of living, given Germany's support for Ukraine. And it has done very well,
*12:32.300- 12:37.080* :  albeit beaten into second place. I briefly mark those comments about the brown stamp.
*12:37.080- 12:42.880* :  Demonizing voters of the AFD doesn't necessarily bring them back on site, does it?
*12:43.200- 12:46.760* :  It doesn't, but the party is bullish that, you know, they are still continuing their line,
*12:46.760- 12:51.060* :  which is that, you know, they've even talked about remigration, deporting migrants. They are very
*12:51.060- 12:55.140* :  they are very confident in their rhetoric. I mean, this is a party which in three states
*12:55.140- 12:59.940* :  of the country has been classified as right wing extremist. The leader in the ranger, the state
*12:59.940- 13:05.000* :  that it won, was found guilty of using a banned Nazi slogan. They say they are not. They say,
*13:05.000- 13:08.380* :  I mean, I spoke to one of their MPs just here. He said that these parties are not a threat to
*13:08.380- 13:12.840* :  democracy. They are simply supporting common sense. And they're saying that migrants who come here
*13:12.840- 13:15.840* :  and cause problems in the country, they don't want and voters don't want them.
*13:16.200- 13:24.280* :  Mark Loen at the AFD party headquarters in Berlin. What a thrill to discover an unknown piece of
*13:24.280- 13:32.380* :  music by the 18th century composer Wolfgang Amadez Mozart. Dr Ulrich Lysinger, director of research
*13:32.380- 13:38.500* :  at the Mozart Institute in the Austrian city of Salzburg, has done exactly that. And the
*13:38.500- 13:43.860* :  piece was performed for the first time, at least the first time in recent history last week. Ed
*13:43.860- 13:49.720* :  would certain heard more from Dr. Lysinger. We basically went through all major libraries and
*13:49.720- 13:56.060* :  this library card at some point caught my attraction, seeing a trio in C major for two
*13:56.060- 14:02.660* :  violins and bass by Mozart. And everybody should know that there is no piece. I can understand
*14:02.660- 14:08.320* :  that other people had it seen before and thought, oh, this cannot possibly be by Mozart.
*14:08.320- 14:16.080* :  The source and the music speak for themselves and for Mozart, starting with the title page,
*14:16.460- 14:24.500* :  where the composer is named Del Signor Wolfgang Mozart. This form of the name was not used after
*14:24.500- 14:30.000* :  the first Italian tours. So only the earliest sources have this form, Wolfgang Mozart.
*14:30.540- 14:37.820* :  Can you point us to a passage which made you immediately think this must be Mozart?
*14:38.460- 14:46.360* :  Let me give you one step first, namely the form of the piece. We have seven movements starting with a
*15:03.060- 15:08.420* :  march. So this is a serenade, a cassazio, a type of music that was common only in South
*15:08.420- 15:18.440* :  and Germany and Austria. And perhaps the most telling piece is the second of the minuets because
*15:18.720- 15:24.300* :  this has in the, particularly in the trio section, it alludes to on playing.
*15:39.880- 15:46.340* :  This is something that we find often in Mozart's vicinity, for example in works by his father,
*15:46.340- 15:52.220* :  Leopold. And another telling spot is the slow movement, the adagio.
*16:06.460- 16:13.600* :  With violins with Sordini and there is a specific characteristic because there is a
*16:13.920- 16:21.000* :  juxtaposition of triplets and straight sixteenths and eighth notes. And we find this characteristics,
*16:21.100- 16:27.680* :  for example, in Mozart's earliest symphony, K-16, or in some of the early violins and artist,
*16:28.300- 16:35.520* :  but basically not later in his lifetime. We'd like to leave our program today with a piece
*16:35.620- 16:41.520* :  from this composition. Can you choose one for us? So I personally would take the finale,
*16:41.520- 16:46.740* :  it's really a charming piece, it's not just a new discover, which will be forgotten on Tuesday.
*16:46.740- 16:53.480* :  I think it will have a slight chance to go into the repertoire because people may add this 10
*17:04.340- 17:09.140* :  minute piece to the programs. Dr. Ulrich Lisinger, director of research at the Mozart Institute
*17:09.140- 17:18.960* :  in Salzburg. Still to come. If the man who's sweeping the floor and the studio came up with an idea
*17:18.960- 17:22.400* :  and took someone, if he thought it was funny, he'd put it in the script.
*17:22.980- 17:30.260* :  Remembering the hit US comedy show Friends, which first appeared on TV screens 30 years ago.
*17:38.760- 17:43.960* :  Explaining football to the friend who's just there for the nachos? Hard, tailgating from

*18:50.040- 18:55.760* :  been killed and three others injured while accompanying diplomats in the northwest of the country.
*18:55.780- 19:00.060* :  The group has returned safely to Islamabad. Caroline Davis reports.
*19:00.700- 19:04.240* :  Diplomats from 11 different countries, including Russia, Iran and Portugal,
*19:04.240- 19:08.460* :  were in swat to attend a conference intended to promote tourism in the district,
*19:08.460- 19:13.400* :  according to one of the events attendees. The explosion happened as the convoy of vehicles
*19:13.400- 19:18.100* :  traveled from the event venue to the hotel. The diplomats and others were supposed to be staying
*19:18.100- 19:22.880* :  in overnight. Images from the scene showed the police van, which was traveling ahead as a scout
*19:22.880- 19:28.500* :  vehicle, blackened and dented from the explosion. Another video shows a police officer. His head
*19:28.500- 19:34.120* :  bandaged and bleeding being wheeled into hospital on a stretcher. So far no one has said they carried out
*19:34.120- 19:40.760* :  the attack. Caroline Davis, it's estimated that half of the world's population don't have access
*19:40.760- 19:47.200* :  to essential health care. In South Africa, hospital trains complete with clinics and a pharmacy,
*19:47.200- 19:52.440* :  are traveling to remote communities to provide affordable treatment. The scheme has been growing
*19:52.440- 20:00.460* :  since it began around 30 years ago and last year saw a staggering 640,000 patients. It's so popular
*20:00.460- 20:05.900* :  that people often have to queue overnight. But as Paul Lecadier reports from Soweto,
*20:06.420- 20:13.600* :  most think it's worth waiting for. As I made my way into the station, I saw a slick grey train,
*20:13.600- 20:21.440* :  19 carriages long. It's called the Transnet Pelopepa healthcare train. Pelopepa means good
*20:21.440- 20:28.180* :  clean health. Besides the train, a two rows of white plastic chairs and mostly older women
*20:28.180- 20:35.180* :  are sitting, waiting patiently to be seen. One of them is Solofello Lydia, who is waiting
*20:35.180- 20:42.500* :  for a dental appointment. I think it's one year I have a problem with my teeth, so I don't like
*20:42.500- 20:47.740* :  the way I smile. For me, I'm just enjoying because it's my first time to come. Also it's
*20:47.820- 20:57.860* :  much cheaper than when I go to the dentist. On the platform, I saw an optician asking
*20:57.860- 21:06.840* :  an elderly lady to read out letters. Another optician, Komotsupalahama, told me they mostly treat
*21:06.840- 21:14.740* :  older patients who struggle to read or see far away. It is really a nice feeling to actually change
*21:14.740- 21:19.720* :  somebody's world. We get patients that come here and they didn't even know how bad their vision
*21:19.720- 21:24.760* :  is. Others are desperate to get spectacles because without government institutions, it takes
*21:24.760- 21:30.220* :  longer for them to get the spectacles, but then with us we provide them with the services in
*21:30.220- 21:38.700* :  the same day. Passing a lens cutting machine, I got talking to Zongezile Makubi, who was waiting
*21:38.700- 21:46.000* :  for his pair of glasses. Zongezile was prepared to wait as he knew he'd get an eye test and new
*21:46.000- 21:52.520* :  glasses for 30 rent. That's less than two US dollars. At a local clinic, he would have paid
*21:52.520- 21:59.280* :  10 times as much. People do not have money, people are unemployed, so once an opportunity like
*21:59.280- 22:05.540* :  this come, people will come in large numbers. The service is way better than the local clinics.
*22:06.220- 22:11.380* :  They're moving very quickly. I matched head it down the train to the dental clinic.
*22:12.340- 22:18.120* :  Well, lots of children this side of the train. I think they are from the same school because
*22:18.600- 22:23.800* :  they are dressed in the same colors, black and white uniform with a bit of red.
*22:24.820- 22:33.360* :  Anyone under 16 get services on the train for free, as I heard from the lead dentist Dr Agnes Ramutla.
*22:34.180- 22:39.680* :  So here we offer services that you find at a maybe a local hospital, so that would be your
*22:39.680- 22:45.240* :  cleanings and your feelings and extractions. So most of our numbers we get them from
*22:45.240- 22:50.180* :  actually schools. Obviously they're desperate for this service. How important is this to you?
*22:50.440- 22:55.080* :  I like helping communities. It's like we are their last hope. I'm very passionate about
*22:55.140- 22:59.920* :  dentistry. I've always wanted to do this my whole life. So this is like a dream.
*23:00.820- 23:08.420* :  The train service really relies on medical students like Timberlite Dubé. Students work on the train
*23:08.420- 23:14.820* :  for a fortnight during their final year of studies. Usually at school you would see two,
*23:14.820- 23:21.680* :  three patients a day, but here we go as far as seeing 120 patients on a daily basis. So it is
*23:21.680- 23:26.960* :  extremely hectic, but it's extremely helpful. I'm part of my passion during dentistry was to
*23:26.960- 23:32.660* :  help people and that's exactly what we are doing here. There are 22 permanent staff who work
*23:32.880- 23:38.680* :  and slip on the train. Nurses and other support workers are employed locally.
*23:39.340- 23:44.620* :  I'm Polar Cagy on board South Africa's hospital train and you can hear more about the trains
*23:44.620- 23:48.620* :  on people fixing the world, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*23:50.400- 23:55.440* :  There's been more grim news over the weekend from Ukraine, civilians killed by Russian drones
*23:55.440- 24:01.340* :  and air strikes, dozens more injured and of course there's the continuing fighting on the ground
*24:01.960- 24:08.600* :  in Kursk in Russia and the Donbass regions. So it might seem odd that both Russia and Ukraine
*24:08.600- 24:15.020* :  have been focused on the world of chess. Russia is excluded from the world chess federation
*24:15.020- 24:20.180* :  along with its ally Biela Rus and on Sunday there was a vote on whether to re-admit them,
*24:20.440- 24:25.400* :  a vote which Russia lost. Our Europe regional editor Paul Moss told us more.
*24:25.920- 24:31.100* :  The first thing you've got to understand is that chess is a big deal in Russia. The game has a
*24:31.100- 24:36.800* :  lot of prestige. It's very popular. In fact, if you look at the last 100 years, most of the world's
*24:36.800- 24:42.620* :  chess champions were Russian. So yes, when Russia was kicked out of the international chess federation,
*24:42.620- 24:47.060* :  that really mattered. It was kicked out after the invasion of Ukraine along as you said with its
*24:47.060- 24:53.520* :  ally Biela Rus and the reason given was that they say chess is essentially a tool now of Vladimir Putin.
*24:53.520- 24:58.260* :  If you look at the Russian chess federation on the board, you have Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin
*24:58.260- 25:03.540* :  spokesman. You have Sergei Shogu, the defense secretary. It's not a past time like any other. Also,
*25:04.100- 25:08.800* :  they say that the Russian chess federation organized tournaments in the areas of Ukraine,
*25:08.800- 25:13.320* :  which Russia has occupied. In other words, chess is complicit in the invasion. So
*25:13.320- 25:19.040* :  Russia is subject to all sorts of boycotts and sanctions. This one really hurt. So here's what
*25:19.040- 25:24.260* :  Vladimir Putin did. This weekend there was a chess congress going on in the Hungarian capital,
*25:24.260- 25:31.960* :  Budapest, and Kyrgyzstan, an ally of Russia, put a motion to admit Russia back into the chess
*25:31.960- 25:36.560* :  federation along with Belarus. I should say it's not just Russia taking this very seriously.
*25:36.560- 25:42.500* :  Vladimir Zelensky sent one of his top people to Budapest to lobby people to try and persuade the
*25:42.500- 25:48.440* :  Ved delegates to vote against admitting Russia again. So the vote went against Russia? What exactly
*25:48.440- 25:53.360* :  happened? Who voted? Yeah, essentially Russia lost and by a large majority, only 21 member states
*25:53.360- 25:58.980* :  voted to completely re-admit Russia. The only caveat is that they voted to look at the possibility
*25:58.980- 26:04.180* :  of allowing junior teams to come, but I think it's under the age of 12, and also chess teams that
*26:04.180- 26:09.080* :  involve disabled people. Now, there's another reason why this really matters. Russia, of course, as I
*26:09.080- 26:15.600* :  said, subjects will sorts of boycotts and sanctions. It's thought that what Vladimir Putin was hoping
*26:16.260- 26:20.820* :  was that if he could muster a majority to reverse this boycott, it would show, look, I can do it,
*26:20.820- 26:26.200* :  I have got countries on my side, and maybe it would lead to other boycotts and sanctions being
*26:26.200- 26:32.000* :  reversed. But if that's what he hoped for, well, it failed, and if that's the case, I would say
*26:32.000- 26:39.480* :  Russia today has one very disappointed president. Paul Moss. Ecuador has just started power cuts
*26:39.480- 26:45.360* :  a day earlier than planned due to a severe drought that's affecting its hydroelectric plants.
*26:45.380- 26:50.920* :  The country is suffering its worst drought in 60 years, with no significant rainfall in over
*26:50.920- 26:56.700* :  two months. Are America's regional editor Leonardo Rocher reports? Ecuador's government had already
*26:56.700- 27:02.100* :  announced overnight power cuts across the country from Monday, but because of the severity of the
*27:02.100- 27:08.100* :  crisis, it cut electricity this weekend in 12 provinces, from eight in the morning to five in the
*27:08.100- 27:13.540* :  afternoon. President Gustavo Noboa says he's considering further cuts and other emergency measures.
*27:14.100- 27:18.860* :  In the capital, Kittel, 60 neighborhoods have had their water supplies suspended.
*27:19.400- 27:24.140* :  Several other countries in South America are suffering the impact of the worst drought in
*27:24.140- 27:30.260* :  living memory. Leonardo Rocher. Now, if you're of a certain age, you'll know exactly what this is.
*27:36.320- 27:41.680* :  That is the theme of the hit US comedy show Friends, which first appeared on TV screens
*27:41.680- 27:48.280* :  30 years ago on Sunday and went on to dominate 90s TV in the US and beyond.
*27:48.280- 27:53.980* :  It's making a comeback now on streaming sites, so a whole new generation is catching up with the
*27:53.980- 27:59.120* :  six main characters, three women and three men in their mid 20s in the first series, at least,
*27:59.480- 28:05.500* :  wrestling with finding jobs in New York, love and drinking vast amounts of coffee as they went.
*28:06.100- 28:10.800* :  Well, the six stars became household names, and the show also featured cameo performances from
*28:10.800- 28:17.480* :  the likes of Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and the British actor Tom Conti, who played Ross Gelers'
*28:17.480- 28:21.600* :  father-in-law. Here's a reminder. Here comes my dab and step-mom.
*28:29.420- 28:35.700* :  Darling, they're good. Darling is the Gellers. He's very seldom bold. I should never have
*28:35.700- 28:36.340* :  Mad at her.
*28:37.640- 28:40.060* :  Rebecca Kesby caught up with Tom Conti,
*28:40.060- 28:43.040* :  and he told her what it was like to be part of the friend's gang.
*28:43.620- 28:46.060* :  Well, it was one of the nicest jobs I've ever had.
*28:46.060- 28:49.160* :  I was astounded when I read it was 30 years, yes.
*28:49.380- 28:52.160* :  But by the time you arrived on the set,
*28:52.220- 28:54.540* :  it wasn't already an established show,
*28:54.540- 28:54.980* :  wasn't it?
*28:55.160- 28:57.100* :  Everybody knew it was a winner already.
*28:57.100- 28:59.580* :  What was it like to arrive on the set
*28:59.580- 29:01.320* :  and meet everybody and be part of the gang?
*29:01.560- 29:04.000* :  Well, it was one of the nicest jobs I've ever had
*29:04.200- 29:05.940* :  when I was asked to do it.
*29:06.240- 29:08.880* :  And I said to the family that I've been asked to do it.
*29:09.100- 29:11.720* :  If I had said, I've just been asked to do a movie
*29:12.020- 29:14.500* :  with Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman.
*29:14.880- 29:17.120* :  And they would have said, oh, that's, that's very nice.
*29:18.340- 29:21.140* :  When I said, I've been asked to do some episodes of friends.
*29:21.620- 29:22.620* :  They went crazy.
*29:23.000- 29:25.900* :  So my God, how completely amazing and wonderful.
*29:26.460- 29:30.360* :  So that was a measure of how the show was perceived, you know,
*29:30.360- 29:34.520* :  by everyone, it was just hugely popular by then.
*29:34.920- 29:36.720* :  I think it was series four, I was in.
*29:36.760- 29:40.140* :  So the surprising thing about it was that quite often
*29:40.440- 29:42.480* :  when people have been working together for years,
*29:42.920- 29:44.560* :  there's that lot had, you know,
*29:44.600- 29:46.420* :  there's a lot of griping goes on
*29:46.420- 29:49.280* :  and they've decided not to like each other and all that
*29:49.280- 29:51.460* :  sort of thing that didn't happen with them.
*29:51.800- 29:54.300* :  Yeah, because you always get this idea
*29:54.300- 29:56.300* :  that they were friends off the set.
*29:56.400- 29:58.620* :  But then when you hear stories from Hollywood
*29:58.620- 30:02.000* :  full of backstabbing and so on, but they really were friends.
*30:02.520- 30:04.100* :  They seemed to be absolutely.
*30:04.660- 30:06.780* :  Yes, I mean, the girls sometimes sat on the boys' knees
*30:06.780- 30:08.280* :  and rehearsals such like, you know,
*30:08.500- 30:10.180* :  they really seemed to like each other,
*30:10.180- 30:12.040* :  which was wonderful and refreshing.
*30:12.680- 30:16.000* :  What do you think it was that made it such a hit?
*30:16.000- 30:19.140* :  Because I mean, it really rejuvenated TV comedy
*30:19.720- 30:20.760* :  at the time, didn't it?
*30:20.760- 30:23.000* :  And a lot of people talk about the script.
*30:23.120- 30:25.640* :  People talk about the set up, you know,
*30:25.640- 30:27.360* :  the fact that it was three boys, three girls.
*30:27.360- 30:29.660* :  What do you think was the magic chemistry?
*30:30.520- 30:33.000* :  Well, the first thing, of course, is always the script.
*30:33.520- 30:35.400* :  I'm not only that, but the team leaders
*30:36.080- 30:38.760* :  who create the atmosphere for working
*30:39.260- 30:42.380* :  and then choosing, as you say, the right cast.
*30:42.380- 30:45.780* :  And it's important when you're casting something
*30:45.780- 30:49.360* :  to choose people who you're not only think are good,
*30:49.840- 30:52.520* :  but you think will be fun to work with and won't be a pain.
*30:52.600- 30:54.720* :  And I think they were very careful about the casting
*30:54.720- 30:57.360* :  and they found people who were pleasant,
*30:57.360- 31:00.260* :  you know, amenable people and that worked.
*31:00.280- 31:03.040* :  The other thing that was wonderful about it was that
*31:03.540- 31:05.640* :  they would take any idea that was funny.
*31:05.860- 31:08.260* :  If you improvised a line, for example,
*31:08.260- 31:11.260* :  at rehearsal as a read through and it got a laugh,
*31:11.960- 31:13.940* :  then that line went into the, you know,
*31:13.940- 31:16.160* :  you could have page, a rewrite page
*31:16.180- 31:17.500* :  under your dressing room door
*31:17.500- 31:19.680* :  and that line was now officially in the script.
*31:20.240- 31:22.280* :  You know, if the man who's sweeping the floor
*31:22.280- 31:25.960* :  and the studio came up with an idea and told someone
*31:26.300- 31:28.460* :  if they thought it was funny, they'd put it in the script.
*31:29.000- 31:30.560* :  That was the actor Tom Conti.
*31:33.020- 31:34.060* :  And that's all from us for now,
*31:34.060- 31:35.400* :  but there will be a new edition
