*01:29.180- 01:32.220* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:34.120- 01:39.660* :  I'm Andrew Peachan at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 9th of September. These are our main stories.
*01:40.420- 01:45.380* :  Growing evidence emerges of record levels of malnutrition affecting children in Afghanistan
*01:45.380- 01:51.540* :  under Taliban rule. Huge crowds turn out in Timor Lester to welcome Pope Francis at the start
*01:51.540- 01:58.500* :  of a three day visit. Also in this podcast we look ahead to the televised debate between Kamala Harris
*01:58.500- 02:03.140* :  and Donald Trump and certain clients prefer to give me their phone and they want me to go the
*02:03.140- 02:07.560* :  extra distance of even like messaging their spouse send a picture of central parks and a
*02:07.560- 02:13.240* :  screenshot of the run and be like be home soon honey. The mules being paid to run in place of people
*02:13.240- 02:22.200* :  trying to boost their exercise records on the fitness app Strava. Afghanistan is facing an
*02:22.200- 02:28.220* :  unprecedented hunger crisis and the country's children are the biggest casualties. 3.2 million
*02:28.220- 02:33.260* :  children under the age of five are malnourished. Aid cuts in the Taliban's policies,
*02:33.260- 02:38.180* :  specifically those restricting the activities of women have resulted in a significant drop in
*02:38.180- 02:43.360* :  funding to public health care and community nutrition programs. The BBC has found that the
*02:43.360- 02:48.960* :  direct impact is a rapid rise in child mortality. From Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan,
*02:48.960- 02:54.360* :  our South Asia correspondent Yuga Tula Mai sent this report which contains some distressing content.
*02:58.180- 03:03.480* :  I'm in the main regional hospital in Jalalabad which is the capital of Nangarhar province in the
*03:03.480- 03:09.240* :  east of Afghanistan. I'm seeing in front of me just a sea of people who are coming in, bringing
*03:09.240- 03:16.540* :  in their sick children and what we've been told is that every day on an average about 600 children
*03:16.540- 03:23.460* :  come here who need to be treated in a hospital but there are only 120 beds. Even the facilities
*03:23.460- 03:28.300* :  that are operating those are being supported at the moment by international aid organizations
*03:28.300- 03:34.600* :  but in the past couple of years we've seen dramatic aid cuts. What we're witnessing in front
*03:34.600- 03:40.860* :  of us is a direct impact of that cut in aid and it's also the impact of the Taliban government's
*03:40.860- 03:47.220* :  policies, especially their restrictions on women which have resulted in some donors cutting funds
*03:47.220- 03:56.620* :  to Afghanistan. I'm in the room where they're treating children with severe acute malnutrition.
*03:56.620- 04:02.980* :  I've counted seven beds and 18 babies and from what doctors here are telling us this is not
*04:03.040- 04:08.420* :  some kind of a seasonal increase. This is now what they see regularly here.
*04:09.280- 04:15.040* :  Seven months old, Hajira babies the size of a newborn baby. She wears a long red t-shirt,
*04:15.040- 04:21.540* :  her legs are bare and stick like. Six of her siblings have died and now she's battling for her life.
*04:22.880- 04:30.760* :  Her mother Amina looks despondent. This is like Doomsday for me. I've suffered so much. I feel so
*04:30.760- 04:35.960* :  much grief. Can you imagine what I've gone through watching my children die? It is because of
*04:36.020- 04:42.620* :  poverty. All I can feed them is dry bread and water that I warm up by keeping it out under the sun.
*04:43.580- 04:47.060* :  One of the babies we've just been shown is in a critical condition.
*04:50.480- 04:57.400* :  She's a one-year-old baby girl. Her name is Asma and she's got a little oxygen mask attached
*04:57.400- 05:04.700* :  to her nose and mouth. She's gasping for breath. She's not blinking. Doctors have told us that they
*05:04.700- 05:09.680* :  don't think this baby will survive. Her mum is sitting beside her.
*05:10.560- 05:18.400* :  Nasiba has already lost three children. I feel like the flesh is melting from my body.
*05:19.100- 05:23.740* :  I can't bear to see her suffering like this. She sounds breaking down into songs.
*05:24.700- 05:32.560* :  The doctor tells us Asma might go into cardiac arrest soon. We leave the room. Less than two hours later
*05:32.560- 05:39.540* :  she died. We've just come back to the malnutrition ward after a couple of hours that we were
*05:39.540- 05:47.100* :  in another part of the hospital. And we've been given the news that baby Asma has died.
*05:48.380- 05:56.100* :  And in her place in the little half a bed that she laid left empty. I can see already another child
*05:56.100- 06:01.220* :  who looks severely malnourished. There are just so many sick children in need.
*06:02.080- 06:07.920* :  Yogi Tula, my reporting from Afghanistan. An influential evangelist preacher and self-styled
*06:07.920- 06:13.160* :  son of God has been arrested in the Philippines after a long chase. Apollo Kibaloy,
*06:13.160- 06:17.880* :  who's accused of sex trafficking and child sexual abuse, has been presented at a news conference
*06:17.880- 06:23.180* :  with several of his co-accused. The interior minister Benjamin Abelos described his arrest.
*06:26.180- 06:31.960* :  He was caught inside the sect's Davao headquarters. The police went inside to look for him.
*06:32.160- 06:37.600* :  And when Kibaloy and his co-accus were about to go out, the police stepped aside. That's what happened.
*06:37.600- 06:42.800* :  They surrendered to the Philippine police. Mr. Kibaloy, who's also wanted in the United States,
*06:42.800- 06:47.580* :  he said to be a friend of the former president Rodrigo Deterte. I heard more about him from our
*06:47.580- 06:55.720* :  Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Hatton. Kibaloy is a preacher who built up a cult following under
*06:55.720- 07:03.600* :  a church called the Kingdom of Jesus Christ. Back in 1973, he went to see the American evangelist
*07:03.600- 07:10.880* :  Billy Graham. And it was at that prayer meeting that Kibaloy said he heard whispers telling him
*07:10.880- 07:17.000* :  that he was also appointed son of God. And that's when he began to become an evangelist himself.
*07:17.000- 07:24.000* :  He had millions of followers in the Philippines who used to tune into his radio and television
*07:24.000- 07:31.600* :  sermons and later online. He really has a devoted following. He's accused, though, by the FBI.
*07:31.600- 07:38.060* :  He was on the FBI's most wanted list in the United States. Along with a very small group of his
*07:38.060- 07:43.900* :  inner circle, sending women and girls overseas to the United States on fraudulent visas,
*07:44.320- 07:50.080* :  and getting those women and girls to use sex in order to solicit what returned as charity
*07:50.080- 07:56.500* :  donations to a fake charity. But that money, the FBI says, was actually being used to fund
*07:56.500- 08:03.040* :  Kibaloy's lifestyle. He had a private jet. He had a huge compound, several homes around the world.
*08:03.040- 08:09.060* :  So that's why the United States wanted him so much. And the Philippines followed shortly after.
*08:09.300- 08:14.760* :  And the end of this story, the chase and the arrest is pretty dramatic. Absolutely. I mean,
*08:15.140- 08:20.920* :  the Philippines and the United States have been hunting for this man for three years. The hunt
*08:20.920- 08:28.860* :  then focused on one of Kibaloy's main properties, which is 70 acres, huge property, 2000 police
*08:28.860- 08:34.000* :  descended on this property and really battled with Kibaloy's followers in order to be able to
*08:34.260- 08:39.780* :  try to find him. They thought he was in an underground bunker and they started using life detection
*08:39.780- 08:45.180* :  equipment, the kind of stuff you would use to find evidence of life in an earthquake zone. They
*08:45.180- 08:50.100* :  found heartbeat underground, but couldn't find the entrance to the bunker. They then had started
*08:50.100- 08:56.460* :  digging underground at tunnel. And that's when either according to Kibaloy's followers, he surrendered
*08:56.460- 09:03.540* :  according to the police. They forced his arrest. Celia Hatton reporting. Outside of the Vatican,
*09:03.540- 09:08.420* :  Timoleste, formerly East Timor, has the highest proportion of Catholics in its population.
*09:08.420- 09:14.100* :  So maybe it's no surprise that thousands camped out and lined the streets to welcome Pope Francis
*09:18.880- 09:23.500* :  as he arrived there. On Tuesday, around 700,000 people, more than half the population, are
*09:23.500- 09:28.480* :  expected to attend an open air mass, which the Pope will celebrate. There are also questions about
*09:28.480- 09:33.700* :  child abuse cases, though linked to the clergy. In a speech in the Capitol Dilly, he said everyone
*09:33.700- 09:39.580* :  had a duty to prevent every kind of abuse of young people, but didn't refer to specific cases or
*09:39.580- 09:44.560* :  acknowledge Vatican responsibility. Christopher White is a correspondent for the National Catholic
*09:44.560- 09:49.720* :  Reporter and has traveled with the Pope to Timoleste. This is a country where the church was
*09:49.720- 09:54.100* :  instrumental in its independence. And because of that, you know, many church leaders,
*09:54.100- 09:59.220* :  presbishops, arts considered heroes, almost untouchable type figures. And what we've seen,
*09:59.220- 10:03.640* :  particularly in the last three years, is that there's a real staggering shameful history of
*10:03.640- 10:09.260* :  clerical sexual abuse going all the way to the top. One of the heroes of this country was a
*10:09.260- 10:15.660* :  bishop by the name of Bello. He was a noble peace prize winner in 1996. And it's been reported
*10:15.660- 10:20.480* :  quite convincingly that he systematically abused teenage boys, and that the Vatican eventually
*10:20.480- 10:26.920* :  retired him for health reasons. And it just came out in 2022 that the Vatican had sort of secretly
*10:26.920- 10:31.960* :  sanctioned him. This is a reality that those on the ground here do not actually believe. You will
*10:31.960- 10:37.920* :  talk to Timolese Catholics, and they hold him in such high esteem that they denied this. So it's
*10:37.920- 10:42.620* :  going to be very interesting to see how the Pope navigates this place where the church and state
*10:42.620- 10:47.420* :  are really quite entangled. We're coming up to what could be a crunch moment in the race for the
*10:47.420- 10:52.720* :  White House. On Tuesday, presidential candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump go head to head
*10:53.060- 10:58.080* :  in what could well be the only televised debate between them. So how much room from Anuva to the two
*10:58.080- 11:03.880* :  candidates still having the polls? I asked CBS correspondent Karissa Lawson. Well, there's not
*11:03.880- 11:08.920* :  actually much room at all, especially given the outcome of the two latest polls of likely voters
*11:08.920- 11:14.300* :  that were just released on Sunday. Those polls show that former President Donald Trump and Vice
*11:14.300- 11:20.040* :  President Kamala Harris are just about even. It really demonstrates just how close the 2024
*11:20.040- 11:26.920* :  U.S. presidential race has become with less than two months left before the November 5th election.
*11:26.920- 11:34.540* :  In the latest New York Times, Sienna College poll, Trump leads Harris 48 to 47%. A CBS news
*11:34.540- 11:40.700* :  UGov poll looked at some of the key battleground states. In Michigan, it shows Harris leading Trump
*11:40.700- 11:48.020* :  by 50 to 49%. In Pennsylvania, it's a dead heat at 50-50. And in Wisconsin, Harris leads Trump
*11:48.020- 11:55.800* :  51 to 49%. And as we saw with Joe Biden, these TV moments can be very significant. We've got a
*11:55.800- 12:00.400* :  situation with these two where Donald Trump in particular is pretending he's doing no preparation
*12:00.400- 12:05.480* :  for the debate, whereas actually they're both doing loads. Right, exactly. Vice President Kamala Harris
*12:05.480- 12:11.280* :  has been preparing for this debate by holding mock debates with a Trump-like substitute, complete
*12:11.280- 12:17.460* :  with television lighting. And would-be moderators asking her very pointed questions. Meanwhile,
*12:17.460- 12:22.760* :  former President Donald Trump has been engaging more in policy briefings with his age,
*12:23.220- 12:28.700* :  but is actually not opted for any mock debates whatsoever. Now, both candidates definitely
*12:28.700- 12:34.020* :  taking different approaches to this high stakes debate that millions of likely U.S. voters will
*12:34.020- 12:38.700* :  be watching. Voters have said they want to know more about how each candidate will tackle things
*12:38.700- 12:44.600* :  that they care most about like the economy. And immigration, meanwhile, some things to note about
*12:44.600- 12:50.460* :  the debate. It will be 90 minutes long. It will not have a live audience, but it will have muted
*12:50.460- 12:55.320* :  microphones when the other candidate is speaking. Something Donald Trump's campaign wanted and
*12:55.320- 13:00.040* :  Harris's campaign did not. Harris's campaign actually said it will prevent Donald Trump from having
*13:00.040- 13:04.880* :  face-to-face conversations with her, but Donald Trump's campaign says they accepted the debate
*13:04.880- 13:10.620* :  under the exact same terms as the first debate against President Biden with he was a nominee.
*13:11.060- 13:15.780* :  Karissa Lawson with me from New York. Now to controversy in the world of running.
*13:15.780- 13:21.180* :  After a TikTok influencer claimed that some runners are paying so-called mules to run
*13:21.180- 13:27.280* :  for them and log in on the fitness app Strava. It tracks physical exercise on a map along with
*13:27.400- 13:32.520* :  times for other followers to view online. Now, I have heard of this kind of thing if staying fit
*13:32.520- 13:37.580* :  gets you a better deal on health insurance, but I haven't heard of it just to get extra kudos
*13:37.580- 13:43.620* :  on Strava. It's about a jewel has the story. I have to confess that for over a year now,
*13:43.620- 13:48.440* :  I have been a Strava mule. If you're not part of the run talk community,
*13:48.440- 13:53.320* :  you may be wondering what an earth fitness influencer Veljko is talking about.
*13:54.140- 13:59.360* :  The TikToker complete with 1980s Mullet and Mustache has gained an online following,
*13:59.360- 14:05.160* :  posting videos about his training schedule. Now, though, he's messed up to making a quick
*14:05.160- 14:10.400* :  bug by running on behalf of other people for cash. So basically, somebody will pay me to run a
*14:10.400- 14:15.240* :  race with their Strava account on my phone. Sometimes they give me their phones. If I'm being honest,
*14:15.240- 14:20.500* :  I'm willing to do anything for the right price. The so-called Strava mules, jockeys or surrogates
*14:20.780- 14:26.460* :  seem to be advertising their services worldwide, with one social media account based in the UK
*14:27.160- 14:32.640* :  providing a global network of athletes, who charged the equivalent of 33 cents per kilometer of
*14:32.640- 14:39.100* :  running and 13 cents for cycling. Hardly a fortune, but if you run with several people's devices at
*14:39.100- 14:46.740* :  once, the fees can add up. But why would anyone pay for such a service? For some, it's part of a
*14:46.740- 14:52.060* :  wider prank on their friends and followers. That's according to running influencer Veljko.
*14:52.260- 14:56.200* :  Today's actually a slow mule day. This is a guy who's probably going to run a 240 marathon,
*14:56.200- 15:00.820* :  but he keeps posting slow times. So then when he does run the marathon, his friends will be like,
*15:00.820- 15:07.220* :  what? No way. That's impossible. But for others, the reason is more simple. In a world where we
*15:07.220- 15:12.580* :  present our best sides on social media, why not try and convince your followers that you're
*15:12.580- 15:17.140* :  a better runner than you really are? The majority of the clients are just one-off muleing
*15:17.140- 15:23.260* :  experiences. They just want the glory for one day, one Instagram story. Is it really so different
*15:23.260- 15:29.560* :  to a slightly photoshopped holiday pick or flattering filter? Or is it a worrying new trend aimed at
*15:29.560- 15:33.940* :  deceiving those around you? Certain clients prefer to give me their phone and they want me to go the
*15:33.940- 15:37.980* :  extra distance of even like messaging their spouse, send them a picture of central parks,
*15:37.980- 15:42.580* :  send them a screenshot of the run and be like, be home soon, honey. Well, the run talk community
*15:42.580- 15:48.580* :  is pretty bemused by the trend, like this Australian user. I don't know how I got it on the side
*15:48.580- 15:56.780* :  of TikTok, but can someone please explain to me why someone would want a Strava mule? What?
*15:56.780- 16:02.320* :  For SofJ Fitness and Influencer Base in the UK, it's just unsustainable.
*16:02.480- 16:07.580* :  Clearly, the lambs people go to to keep up these fake appearances. It's also that so embarrassing
*16:07.580- 16:12.080* :  if then your friend asks you off the cuff to go for a run with them and you can't keep up.
*16:12.440- 16:17.880* :  It seems that some people will do anything for Kudos, so what happens now that the lid's
*16:17.880- 16:22.660* :  been lifted on this inventive news social media phenomenon? It's about a dual reporting.
*16:24.960- 16:30.340* :  Still to come on this podcast? I love it, I love the old furniture, it really brings it into
*16:30.340- 16:36.960* :  character. I like that way of moving to a castle. It's really exciting. The children being
*16:36.960- 16:39.420* :  scored in a medieval English castle.
*16:47.980- 16:53.520* :  Good taste is easy to spot, but hard to pin down. You know it when you see it. And in today's
*16:53.520- 16:58.720* :  culture, there's no greater signifier of taste than the car you drive. You want something
*16:59.760- 17:06.100* :  sophisticated, but not stodgy, daring yet classic, approachable, but with an air of opulence.
*17:06.220- 17:11.820* :  That's where the Range Rover evoke comes in. The reductive exterior is an elegant expression of

*18:12.820- 18:17.260* :  Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russia's course region last month boosted national morale.
*18:17.260- 18:22.500* :  But Ukraine is on the back foot in key parts of the battlefield at home. In the east,
*18:22.500- 18:27.420* :  troops are trying to hold on to the strategically important city of Pokrovsk, but thousands of
*18:27.420- 18:31.460* :  civilians are now fleeing. Abdul Jalil Abdul Rasulov has been to the area.
*18:36.340- 18:42.120* :  Soldiers of the 15th Brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard rushed to their artillery installation.
*18:43.660- 18:50.520* :  They operate near the town of Selideva in eastern Ukraine and have just received an order to open fire.
*18:54.800- 19:00.660* :  Each crew member has his own task. One soldier turns away to aim the gun,
*19:01.400- 19:05.820* :  another one loads it. When ready, commander pulls the rope.
*19:09.020- 19:16.360* :  The gun is an old American Houter M101. This same type of weapon was used in World War II.
*19:17.400- 19:21.960* :  Now Ukrainian forces rely on it to stop Russian troops.
*19:26.780- 19:33.140* :  And lately Russian attacks in their area have been relentless, as Dmitro, Commander of the unit
*19:33.140- 19:39.680* :  explains. The fighting is very intense. We fire up to 200 rounds a day.
*19:40.480- 19:44.300* :  The enemy continues their attacks in small groups, sometimes up to 60 people.
*19:45.140- 19:49.080* :  They're trying to break through our defensive lines, so we provide cover to our infantry.
*19:52.300- 20:00.320* :  15 kilometers west of Selideva is Pokrovsk. This city is a major transportation hub in eastern Ukraine,
*20:00.920- 20:05.600* :  essential for delivering food, weapons and soldiers to the front line.
*20:07.220- 20:12.120* :  Moscow's objective is to seize this city and cut off the supply route.
*20:12.660- 20:17.860* :  Pokrovsk is turning into another ghost town on the front line. Banks, shops and other
*20:17.860- 20:23.080* :  businesses are closed, and the sound of explosions is getting louder and louder each day.
*20:23.880- 20:27.260* :  And this city is already within the range of Russian artillery.
*20:28.120- 20:33.000* :  The authorities urge local residents to get out while they still can.
*20:35.720- 20:41.500* :  Sixty-nine year old Maria Goncharenko heats this advice and signs up for evacuation.
*20:45.400- 20:51.020* :  Volunteers in blue bulletproof beds arrive to pick her up from an old Soviet apartment block.
*20:51.840- 20:55.420* :  They take her to an assembly point and help to board a bus.
*20:57.440- 20:59.880* :  Do I need to pay? Maria asks them.
*21:00.900- 21:03.780* :  No, she's assured. It's all free of charge.
*21:05.040- 21:07.060* :  Then she bursts into tears.
*21:10.020- 21:14.960* :  We lived peacefully, worked until retirement, and look at what Russians did to us.
*21:15.460- 21:16.360* :  I curse Putin.
*21:19.300- 21:21.460* :  Do you know where you're going to, I ask?
*21:23.840- 21:26.980* :  No, but the most important thing is to get out of this city.
*21:27.180- 21:28.860* :  I'm going to get out of here.
*21:29.860- 21:32.120* :  Attraport from Adichalil Abdul Rasulov.
*21:32.760- 21:37.740* :  According to the United Nations, the civil war in Sudan has killed more than 20,000 people
*21:37.740- 21:40.440* :  and created the world's biggest displacement crisis.
*21:41.040- 21:45.580* :  You may have heard in our earlier podcast that the military government has rejected a UN proposal
*21:45.580- 21:49.200* :  for the deployment of an international peacekeeping force there.
*21:49.800- 21:53.280* :  The head of the world health organization Dr. Tedros Adhani Gubiessis
*21:53.540- 21:56.840* :  has been to Sudan over the weekend and raised the alarm about the famine,
*21:56.980- 21:58.620* :  affecting some parts of the country.
*21:59.340- 22:05.320* :  I was shaken by the state of many of the tiny, tiny western children
*22:05.960- 22:13.060* :  and stunned by the harrowing accounts of their mothers who have been displaced multiple times.
*22:13.860- 22:18.440* :  Sudanese are suffering through a perfect storm of crisis.
*22:19.440- 22:22.500* :  Back in May, a Dutch think tank called the Klingendoll Institute,
*22:22.500- 22:27.440* :  warned that two million people would die of hunger and related diseases by the end of this year.
*22:28.040- 22:32.480* :  Leyla Malana Allen is a correspondent for PBS NewsHour and it's just back from Sudan.
*22:33.220- 22:37.820* :  I flew into Potsudam, went down to Ombraman, which is part of Hartoom State,
*22:37.820- 22:43.740* :  just next to the capital Hartoom, which has been recently taken back by the Sudanese armed forces.
*22:44.300- 22:49.940* :  I went up to Shendi and Aparah, which are areas in between, and then wound over to Kassala and
*22:49.940- 22:54.740* :  Ghizaraf, which are on the other side of Sinara State, which is an area that the Aparahs
*22:54.740- 22:58.740* :  have been sweeping through at the moment, and that's kind of the bread bowl of the country,
*22:58.740- 23:00.820* :  where most of the grain for the country is made.
*23:01.320- 23:03.900* :  And how widespread would the food shortages?
*23:05.240- 23:06.320* :  They're very erratic.
*23:07.160- 23:12.020* :  What's pretty horrifying to see is the people who are managing to escape from Aparahsaf held
*23:12.020- 23:16.400* :  areas and frontline areas, who are evidently severely emaciated.
*23:16.820- 23:21.180* :  I was going into hospitals, seeing children with severe malnutrition,
*23:21.820- 23:25.580* :  with looking five, six months old, their lungs are starting to fail, their lives are failing,
*23:25.580- 23:29.060* :  they had so little food, they can barely take the formula they're being fed,
*23:29.580- 23:32.380* :  their parents, of course, are giving them what food they can get hold of,
*23:32.820- 23:36.980* :  but those parents and mothers themselves can't make any breast milk because they've got malnutrition
*23:36.980- 23:41.240* :  themselves, and they're often waiting so long to get to the hospital because it's so dangerous
*23:41.240- 23:44.720* :  to cross that sometimes it's too late and children are dying of this.
*23:45.040- 23:47.640* :  Now, in some areas where the roads have been opened by the army,
*23:47.880- 23:53.380* :  there is more food, the problem is that prices have gone up ten times at least in the last few
*23:53.380- 23:57.400* :  months because of a huge economic crash, so even where there is food, people can't afford it.
*23:57.740- 24:03.400* :  What is the solution in a situation where both the paramilitaries and the government army
*24:03.400- 24:10.420* :  are refusing to have those the UN force that might kind of help with making the situation
*24:10.420- 24:17.360* :  calmer so that they can get food to people? So, the aid issue is just one issue here,
*24:17.420- 24:21.720* :  and the reality is that just managing to open some of the aid pathways, of course,
*24:21.720- 24:25.920* :  we know that both the RSF and the Sudanese armed forces are blocking access for aid.
*24:25.920- 24:28.800* :  Some of that has recently been opened, but the majority is still closed.
*24:29.340- 24:32.280* :  Just providing aid to people is not going to solve the problem.
*24:32.280- 24:36.800* :  If you are able to get hold of food, but you are being displaced five, six times,
*24:36.800- 24:41.300* :  every time your family finds somewhere safe, a militia or an air strike turns up and you have
*24:41.300- 24:45.560* :  to flee again, your daughters are being raped, your family members are being killed in front of you,
*24:45.760- 24:50.200* :  your children haven't been in school for a year and a half, just getting food there is not enough.
*24:50.640- 24:55.520* :  Now, this is a civil war in that it's an internally fought war, but it's not a civil war in terms
*24:55.520- 25:00.560* :  of the Sudanese people fighting each other. This is two military groups who are fighting each other
*25:00.560- 25:05.160* :  with the people in the middle and the people are suffering. The reality is that something political
*25:05.160- 25:11.300* :  has to be done to force these warring parties to stop and prioritize the well-being of the Sudanese
*25:11.300- 25:17.280* :  people. Laila Malana Allen with levodiseko. The tech giant Google is in court facing its
*25:17.280- 25:22.960* :  second big anti-trust case of the year with the US Department of Justice this time focusing on
*25:22.960- 25:30.520* :  Google's advertising. Performance Max expands on your AI powered search campaigns so you can drive
*25:30.520- 25:34.780* :  incremental conversions across Google's full range of advertising channels, including
*25:34.780- 25:41.820* :  search and also YouTube display, Gmail, Discover and Maps. Prosecutors argue Google operates a
*25:41.820- 25:47.380* :  monopoly stifling innovation and competition. Google has long fought back against claims that it's
*25:47.400- 25:52.240* :  too dominant. US analyst Bobo Donnell told us what the authorities are concerned about.
*25:52.900- 25:57.000* :  We have to think about this in terms of the different pieces. I mean, Google, that is alphabet,
*25:57.000- 26:02.020* :  is this huge conglomerate. They have many different pieces. This is the ad tech business and it's
*26:02.020- 26:06.700* :  a portion of the ad tech business. It's not the Google ad words where companies can buy a word
*26:06.700- 26:10.900* :  if you search for word that pops up their ad. This is a different part of that ad business.
*26:11.300- 26:16.840* :  In general, Google's advertising business has been quite robust. But again, this piece is separate
*26:16.840- 26:21.540* :  from that and what they're specifically looking at here is this ad technology that's pretty much
*26:21.540- 26:26.500* :  a behind the scenes kind of thing where there's a marketplace for these advertisements and how they
*26:26.500- 26:30.320* :  get placed and how they get bought and sold. Google has been doing a lot of that of course because
*26:30.320- 26:34.740* :  they needed some of this as they developed their search engine and all the advertising associated
*26:34.740- 26:40.880* :  with it. So one possibility is that if there is a breakup, perhaps it's just a sale of this ad tech
*26:41.260- 26:46.140* :  which is not going to impact all the things that we interact with Google and alphabet. But of
*26:46.140- 26:50.440* :  course, from a total business perspective, it would be obviously a big change. So it's going to be
*26:50.440- 26:55.680* :  interesting to see a lot of this is around banner ads. And as you know, more and more ads are
*26:55.680- 27:00.780* :  happening through mobile devices and other different places. And so it's hard to make a discussion
*27:00.780- 27:05.560* :  about one type of ad when there's many other types of ads. And I think that's of course what Google
*27:05.560- 27:10.500* :  is going to argue on the other side, the Department of Justice is going to say, look, there haven't
*27:10.500- 27:15.380* :  been enough people who are offering this exchange type service and that's a monopoly and that's
*27:15.380- 27:18.960* :  a bad thing. And of course, they just won the first trial. So there's going to be a little bit of
*27:18.960- 27:24.760* :  momentum from the DOJ against Google on this second one. When the world renowns street artists
*27:24.760- 27:29.960* :  Banksy went on a painting spree in London this summer, it became a huge tourist attraction.
*27:30.180- 27:35.420* :  There was lots of speculation over what his nine works meant artistically. What do they mean
*27:35.420- 27:40.380* :  financially for the areas where he chooses to make his mark? This from Sarah Rogers.
*27:41.180- 27:43.900* :  What makes anything worth what's worth? I mean, whatever someone's going to play,
*27:43.900- 27:46.760* :  got one at the end of my road. Has it increased the value of my flat? I'm not sure.
*27:46.760- 27:51.260* :  Priceless. Any artist is good for attracting people and populating cities.
*27:51.440- 27:54.880* :  You can't move it, so it's prices, I suppose. It's just cool for everybody to see it.
*27:55.160- 28:01.120* :  Cool to see for free, but there's no doubt the elusive Banksy is a very bankable artist.
*28:01.740- 28:07.020* :  If you ask a lot of people to name an artist, often they can name Banksy. So when nine pieces
*28:07.020- 28:12.560* :  featuring animals, including elephants, a rhino, and even a cat appeared sprawled across London,
*28:12.560- 28:20.720* :  they brought in the crowds. Wow. Wow. I'm following their trail to find out how the wow
*28:20.720- 28:26.060* :  factor is financially impacting the areas they've been left in. The next station is mortgage.
*28:26.640- 28:30.840* :  First historic guild hall yard where there's piranhas painted on a police box,
*28:31.220- 28:33.840* :  Madeline White from Hangup Gallery is a Banksy specialist.
*28:34.180- 28:39.720* :  Culturally he's incredibly valuable and it enters people's lives in a way that it might not
*28:39.720- 28:43.880* :  if it were hidden away in a gallery. It's not hidden away, but the local authority,
*28:43.880- 28:48.920* :  the city of London Corporation, have snapped up the piranha police box, moving it outside one
*28:48.920- 28:53.560* :  of its galleries. Culture chairman Munsar Ali. We decided to move it here for the public
*28:53.560- 28:58.480* :  good to protect it. We're not in the business to support graffiti arts. We don't support
*28:58.480- 29:03.100* :  graffiti art, but we want to protect and support Banksy. Why is that? I knew you were the last
*29:03.100- 29:08.060* :  one. You've had a 2,000 people come over here. I'm hoping those 2,000 people will go and then
*29:08.060- 29:12.680* :  have a coffee at a local coffee shops and increase business for the local businesses.
*29:14.700- 29:19.560* :  Okay, so is that happening? Let's head to the tourist area of Brick Lane. It's full of shops
*29:19.560- 29:25.880* :  in global cuisine and a Banksy. Three monkeys swinging across a railway bridge. There's even a
*29:25.880- 29:30.920* :  tour group as we arrive. Here's that Banksy. We just walked down the street and it was that.
*29:31.280- 29:35.640* :  So you didn't intentionally come to this area to look for? No, we've come for bagels. So is it
*29:35.640- 29:40.420* :  boosting business? Yeah, people just stop there, they take a photo and pass. That's it.
*29:40.540- 29:46.080* :  A lot of people come here, they lay on the stairs, they sit on the stairs. It's not good for the
*29:49.520- 29:55.300* :  business. But if you're off the tourist beat like Pobona Mark, the Banksy depicting a rhino,
*29:55.300- 30:01.660* :  mounting a car five minutes from his pub is very welcome. It's bought a nice weekday lunch
*30:01.660- 30:07.020* :  on trades. Thank you very much. Please put one on the side of our wall.
*30:08.760- 30:13.380* :  Students in the UK are starting their first four week back at school after the summer break.
*30:13.380- 30:17.480* :  But for people that won primary school in the village of Kenton in southwest England,
*30:17.480- 30:22.560* :  their learning environment looks a little different. The children are having lessons in a medieval
*30:22.560- 30:27.960* :  castle after their school was flooded. Jeanine Jansen's been to see how the pupils and teachers
*30:27.960- 30:38.340* :  are getting on. Powder and castle, a stunning setting fit for an Earl. But never in their wildest
*30:38.340- 30:45.420* :  dreams did the children from Kenton think this would be their new school. I thought the teachers
*30:45.420- 30:52.640* :  were joking. They couldn't wait to enter with fantasies of Harry Potter and the Hogwarts
*30:52.640- 31:00.100* :  School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I love it. I love the old furniture. It really brings it into
*31:00.100- 31:08.480* :  character. I like that way of move to a castle. It's really exciting. This time last year flooding
*31:08.480- 31:15.900* :  hit Kenton and their beloved school was a complete mud bath. To see what we're left with
*31:16.740- 31:23.360* :  is heartbreaking. Absolutely heartbreaking. First they shared with their neighbouring school at Ken.
*31:24.280- 31:32.560* :  Then they moved into this church in Doolish. The children really have been on quite a journey.
*31:33.660- 31:41.200* :  I really miss Kenton's school, but I love being on the move sort of.
*31:41.580- 31:47.060* :  The Earl of Devon is fantastic. He's been so supportive of Kenton Primary School. He really is
*31:47.060- 31:54.520* :  such a lovely chap. It really feels quite surreal to come to school down the drive, up through past
*31:54.520- 32:00.740* :  the deer park, into the castle. It really has been an amazing experience so far. Everywhere you look,
*32:00.740- 32:08.360* :  there are castles and turrets. The best thing is probably the playground. We can play football
*32:08.820- 32:15.300* :  without and slide tackle without hurting ourselves on par with it. We also see deer day today
*32:16.260- 32:23.560* :  and I've seen three buzzards flying around. Today we saw some geese.
*32:23.560- 32:30.660* :  Going back in time is clearly a novelty. Just love being in the Victorian classroom.
*32:31.600- 32:38.920* :  There's lots of old tables which it's really cool because you've got a section underneath to put
*32:38.920- 32:45.020* :  all your stationery. Well, they're really weird because some stuff like slips off and falls.
*32:46.120- 32:47.800* :  And the seats are really uncomfortable. Yeah.
*32:49.920- 32:54.260* :  They've just found out they've got funding to build a brand new school in the village.
*32:54.880- 33:01.100* :  But the question is, after the magic of powder and castle, will they ever want to leave?
*33:02.800- 33:03.940* :  Janine Jansen reporting.
*33:06.480- 33:10.280* :  And that's all from us for now. There will be a new edition of Global News to download later.
