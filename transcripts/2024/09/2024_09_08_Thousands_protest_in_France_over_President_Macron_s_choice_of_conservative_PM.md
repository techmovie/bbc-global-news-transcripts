*01:36.940- 01:41.880* :  I'm Janet Jalil, and in the early hours of Sunday, the 8th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:42.600- 01:47.240* :  Tens of thousands of people have been demonstrating across France, claiming President Macron
*01:47.240- 01:53.560* :  has stolen democracy by appointing a right-wing Prime Minister. Security forces in Venezuela's
*01:53.560- 01:59.460* :  capital have encircled the Argentine Embassy, where prominent opposition figures have been sheltering
*01:59.460- 02:05.540* :  for months. The heads of the American and British intelligence services say the world is facing
*02:05.540- 02:12.480* :  a threat, not seen since the Cold War. Also in this podcast...
*02:18.820- 02:25.280* :  The award-winning lyricist, Will Jennings, who wrote many hits like this one, has died at the age of 80.
*02:29.960- 02:35.360* :  We begin in France, where tens of thousands of people have been taking part in demonstrations,
*02:35.360- 02:40.960* :  claiming that President Macron has stolen democracy by appointing a right-wing Prime Minister,
*02:41.380- 02:46.020* :  Michel Barnier. The mostly left-wing protesters took to the streets of more than a hundred
*02:46.020- 02:55.200* :  towns and cities. These demonstrators in Bordeaux shouted resistance resistance.
*02:55.880- 03:00.400* :  Mr Barnier, a former Foreign Minister, who also acted as the EU's Brexit Negotiator,
*03:00.400- 03:04.860* :  was appointed by President Macron on Thursday after two months of political deadlock
*03:04.860- 03:10.660* :  in the wake of inconclusive elections, which saw Parliament roughly split in three between a left
*03:10.660- 03:16.160* :  wing alliance, Mr Macron's centrist and the far-right. Although the left did win the most votes,
*03:16.160- 03:21.900* :  it came nowhere near an absolute majority. The French far-right leader, Jordan Badella,
*03:21.900- 03:25.680* :  had this warning for President Macron and his new Prime Minister.
*03:29.900- 03:35.220* :  If Mr Barnier wants to be the voice and the driver of the democratic aspirations
*03:35.340- 03:41.420* :  that were expressed in the elections, then I will judge him on his policies.
*03:42.760- 03:49.600* :  If, on the other hand, he is the new frontman for Macronism, and he continues the policy
*03:49.600- 03:56.360* :  that was led by the French President and Manuel Macron, then this government will fall.
*03:57.400- 04:02.720* :  Natalie Ozeo is a French MP for La France and Soumise, the France Unbound Party,
*04:02.720- 04:04.680* :  which forms part of the left wing alliance.
*04:05.440- 04:10.700* :  Emmanuel Macron's decision to appoint right-winger Michel Barnier is just a betrayal
*04:11.220- 04:15.800* :  of the people's vote and of the message that was sent on July the 7th.
*04:16.360- 04:20.140* :  So this is outrageous. It's democratically scandalous.
*04:21.220- 04:26.700* :  I think this protest day, today's September 7th, may be just the first step.
*04:27.060- 04:33.760* :  The outrage, the anger, is just increasing, but now people are fed up with Macron's
*04:33.760- 04:40.500* :  methods, and it cannot last longer. I asked our Paris correspondent Huseko Field if the left
*04:40.560- 04:44.460* :  had got the turnout they were hoping for. It's always hard to judge these things,
*04:44.460- 04:49.360* :  and when the left is claiming success, of course, they're saying 150,000 on the streets of Paris,
*04:49.360- 04:54.360* :  police are saying 25,000, the police are more likely to be accurate than what the left's
*04:55.340- 05:00.240* :  estimations are. So I wouldn't say it was a massive turnout at all, but I mean, she's right,
*05:00.240- 05:05.720* :  I think, in saying that this is only the beginning. This heralds suspect, a long period in which
*05:06.160- 05:09.920* :  it's likely that they could be successive demonstrations, which are likely to increase in
*05:10.600- 05:15.720* :  intensity and size. Because as you heard from us, they're very angry. They feel a righteous
*05:15.720- 05:21.720* :  indignation that while they say they won the election on numerical terms, they've been kind of
*05:21.720- 05:27.560* :  short-circuited, and Macron's turn to the centre-right to form the next government. So they feel
*05:27.560- 05:31.620* :  that they're powered up now. They've got a cause that they can really put people up with,
*05:32.040- 05:36.100* :  and I suspect that's what's going to happen. Well, they left to say that the far-right led by
*05:36.100- 05:41.720* :  Marine Le Pen are now effectively king-makers. Do they have a point? Well, they do have a point.
*05:41.720- 05:46.740* :  That language, isn't itself, of course, shows a certain point of view. I mean, what's clear
*05:46.740- 05:53.440* :  is that the far-right has a veto in effect on Michel Barnier. As you've said, succinctly,
*05:53.440- 05:59.040* :  at the beginning, you know, no party can govern by itself. So the anyway, a party can govern,
*05:59.040- 06:03.280* :  and essentially, you know, Barnier's from the centre, is if one of the other two blocks
*06:03.280- 06:08.640* :  decides temporarily to either back him or at least abstain. And that's what's happened,
*06:08.640- 06:14.040* :  that the hard-right is abstaining, that populists are abstaining in effect from coming up with
*06:14.040- 06:20.120* :  any strong view on Barnier, waiting to see what he does. That's why the left can say, oh, he's
*06:20.120- 06:24.540* :  only there with the connivance of the hard-right, and there's a sort of tacit alliance between the
*06:24.540- 06:29.700* :  centre, the right, and the hard-right. Of course, it suits the left to sort of maintain that idea,
*06:29.700- 06:33.480* :  because it looks like Macron's took on the bed with the fascists and all the rest of it.
*06:33.840- 06:39.040* :  I mean, the reality is a reality of a very, very complex political situation, and that reality is
*06:39.040- 06:43.960* :  also one in which, you know, Barnier is, thankfully, on a thread. I mean, he could go any minute,
*06:43.960- 06:49.340* :  if the hard-right decides to drop him. Huse Goefield. As we record this podcast,
*06:49.340- 06:54.540* :  Venezuela's security forces have surrounded the Argentine embassy in the capital Caracas,
*06:54.980- 06:59.720* :  which is sheltering six Venezuelan political figures opposed to President Nicolas Maduro.
*07:00.220- 07:05.500* :  The Venezuelan government has also revoked its permission for Brazil to represent Argentinian
*07:05.500- 07:11.480* :  diplomatic interests. Jenny Kumar reports from Washington. Some of those sheltering in the embassy
*07:11.480- 07:17.160* :  have posted on social media that electricity was cut off. They fled there after facing a rest
*07:17.160- 07:23.020* :  for alleged political violence in March. The government has now accused them of planning terrorism
*07:23.020- 07:28.840* :  and assassination attempts. It's also announced it's revoked Brazil's custody of the embassy
*07:28.840- 07:35.060* :  in an apparent attempt to remove diplomatic immunity. Brazil has said it would continue its
*07:35.060- 07:39.140* :  custody of the embassy until another state was selected to take over.
*07:40.180- 07:46.060* :  Jenny Kumar. The international order is under threat in a way that we haven't seen since the
*07:46.060- 07:51.520* :  Cold War. That's the warning from the heads of the US and British foreign intelligence services.
*07:52.100- 07:57.520* :  The CIA chief William Burns and Richard Moore, who leads MI6, have written an article together
*07:57.520- 08:02.800* :  in a British newspaper warning of an unprecedented array of challenges to global security.
*08:03.480- 08:07.180* :  In a joint appearance in London, they said they were working to disrupt what they called
*08:07.180- 08:12.520* :  Russia's campaign of sabotage across Europe. They said that as well as resisting Russia's war
*08:12.520- 08:17.220* :  of aggression in Ukraine, they were also pushing for a de-escalation of conflict in the Middle
*08:17.220- 08:22.700* :  East and working to thought the Islamic State Group. The BBC's security correspondent Gordon
*08:22.700- 08:28.420* :  Carrera was at the event. Ukraine's incursion into Russia may have taken western spy chief
*08:28.420- 08:34.740* :  surprise, but the heads of the CIA and MI6 praised the operation as a significant achievement
*08:34.740- 08:41.240* :  while also saying the consequences remained unclear. There have been suggestions that fears over how
*08:41.240- 08:46.040* :  the Russian leader might respond have slowed down the provision of support to Ukraine.
*08:46.220- 08:51.860* :  But William Burns said that while there have been moments of concern, Russian threats should not
*08:51.860- 08:57.500* :  paralyze the West. There was a moment in the fall of 2022, when I think there was a genuine
*08:57.500- 09:03.400* :  risk of, you know, the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons. I have never thought, however,
*09:03.460- 09:09.540* :  and this is the view of my agency, that we should be unnecessarily intimidated by that. Putin's
*09:09.540- 09:14.860* :  a bully. He's going to continue to save or save or rattle from time to time. Moscow spy
*09:14.860- 09:18.800* :  services have been accused of becoming more aggressive in their operations in Europe,
*09:18.800- 09:25.600* :  carrying out arson and sabotage. This has included using criminals, but Sir Richard Moore said this
*09:25.600- 09:31.480* :  did not necessarily mean they were becoming more amateurish. It's just a bit more reckless,
*09:31.480- 09:36.140* :  I mean, I think Russian intelligence services have gone a bit feral. This was the first ever
*09:36.140- 09:42.880* :  joint appearance in public by the heads of CIA and MI6, and the message was clear. Cooperation
*09:42.880- 09:48.140* :  between their two spy agencies remains closer than ever. Gordon Carrera,
*09:48.920- 09:54.260* :  the killing of an American Turkish activist in the occupied West Bank on Friday sparked outrage
*09:54.260- 09:58.680* :  with the United Nations calling for an investigation, and the Turkish President,
*09:58.680- 10:06.300* :  Recep Tayyip Erwan, describing it as a barbaric act. Witnesses say Aishino or Esgi Igi was shot
*10:06.300- 10:11.800* :  in the head by Israeli soldiers and her family are demanding an independent US-led investigation
*10:11.800- 10:17.740* :  into her death. Standing over the wrapped bodies of Ms. Egi and a Palestinian girl in a hospital
*10:17.740- 10:23.300* :  morgue, the governor of Nablus Hassan Douglas said the Israeli military would continue killing
*10:23.300- 10:31.980* :  indiscriminately unless the war in Gaza ended. But it's done to differentiate between an activist
*10:31.980- 10:37.080* :  and a Palestinian girl. We tell the whole world it's time to stop the crazy war on the Palestinian
*10:37.080- 10:41.720* :  people, the killing of children and the demolishing of mosques, churches, schools and hospitals.
*10:42.480- 10:45.760* :  From Jerusalem, here's our diplomatic correspondent, James Landel.
*10:46.460- 10:51.360* :  The family of Aishino or Esgi, Aegee, said she'd been a passionate human rights activist
*10:51.360- 10:56.600* :  all her life. In a statement, they said she'd been killed needlessly, unlawfully and violently
*10:56.600- 11:02.320* :  by the Israeli military. They said an inquiry by the authorities in Israel would not be adequate
*11:02.320- 11:07.940* :  and called on President Biden to order an independent investigation. The 26-year-old,
*11:07.940- 11:13.540* :  who had joined US and Turkish nationality, had just graduated from Washington University in Seattle.
*11:14.180- 11:18.700* :  She was taking part in a protest against an illegal settlement in Nablus in the West Bank.
*11:19.460- 11:23.460* :  Witnesses in Palestinian officials said Israeli soldiers shot her in the head.
*11:24.100- 11:28.760* :  The Israeli defense forces said the incident was under review but claimed that soldiers had
*11:28.760- 11:34.800* :  fired at an instigator of violent activity who was throwing rocks. The organizers of the protest,
*11:34.800- 11:40.420* :  the international solidarity movement, insisted it had been peaceful and said Miss Aegee had
*11:40.420- 11:45.460* :  been 200 meters away from the soldiers. The United Nations called for a full investigation.
*11:45.500- 11:49.960* :  The White House said it was deeply disturbed and had asked Israel to investigate.
*11:51.040- 11:56.620* :  James Landel. Voting has ended in Algeria in a presidential election, which the incumbent
*11:56.620- 12:03.480* :  Adam Majeed Tebun is widely expected to win. More than 24 million Algerians are registered to vote,
*12:03.900- 12:09.320* :  and President Tebun's two challenges had called for a high turnout. But campaign rallies
*12:09.320- 12:15.880* :  have struggled to generate enthusiasm in this North African nation. Richard Hamilton considers
*12:15.880- 12:23.440* :  the significance of these elections. Ever since 1992 when elections were annulled, Algeria has
*12:23.440- 12:29.680* :  been run by a military-backed government. In that year an Islamist party was on course to win,
*12:30.300- 12:36.380* :  but the Algerian elite was deeply worried by that prospect and halted democracy in its tracks.
*12:37.140- 12:44.140* :  The annulment provoked a bloody civil war that lasted until 2002. And in the aftermath,
*12:44.140- 12:50.240* :  the country has been stable but tightly controlled and election results have been a formality.
*12:50.940- 12:54.460* :  But then in 2019 something remarkable happened.
*12:55.020- 13:00.640* :  Protests against the ailing president of Algeria who's running for a fifth term in April's
*13:00.640- 13:07.960* :  elections have turned violent. Massive street protests broke out against the 82-year-old president
*13:07.960- 13:15.260* :  Abdulaziz Bhutaflika. The demonstrations became known as the revolution of smiles as they were
*13:15.260- 13:23.000* :  largely peaceful or Iraq. They did succeed in forcing Bhutaflika to stand down, but hopes of
*13:23.000- 13:31.200* :  lasting change soon evaporated. As in Egypt and Sudan, the protesters felt the revolution had
*13:31.200- 13:38.360* :  been stolen by the army. Algeria remains a repressive society and there's little freedom of speech
*13:38.360- 13:45.200* :  or the media. Amnesty international has said the authorities have a zero-tolerance approach
*13:45.200- 13:51.920* :  towards dissenting opinions. And that is why so many people did not want to endorse Abdulaziz
*13:51.920- 13:57.920* :  taboon. He voted today making positive noises about the electoral process.
*14:02.020- 14:06.900* :  The election campaign was a clean campaign really. The candidates were up to scratch.
*14:06.940- 14:12.040* :  They painted an image that was a tribute to Algeria and Algerian democracy.
*14:12.740- 14:18.020* :  With young people making up more than half the population, all three candidates promised
*14:18.020- 14:23.340* :  improved living standards and reducing the country's dependence on oil and gas.
*14:24.260- 14:30.860* :  The electoral commission announced that as of 5pm there had been a turnout of just 26 percent,
*14:31.580- 14:36.260* :  compared to 33 percent during the 2019 elections at the same time.
*14:37.180- 14:44.180* :  78-year-old Abdulaziz taboon is heavily favoured to see off two relatively weak challenges,
*14:44.300- 14:51.580* :  as many other candidates have been prevented from standing. Official results are expected on Sunday.
*14:52.560- 14:58.460* :  Richard Hamilton reporting. Now let's turn to matters aquatic. We know that life under the
*14:58.460- 15:06.320* :  surface of our oceans is plentiful but not necessarily noisy. That was until now. A new book by
*15:06.320- 15:11.840* :  the Canadian science writer Amarina Kingdon called Sing Like A Fish describes how the oceans
*15:11.860- 15:18.400* :  actually have a vast range of sounds made by fish, crustaceans and even simpler forms of life
*15:18.780- 15:24.740* :  which we humans cannot always hear. She spoke to Julian Warwicker from Redmond Bay in Ontario.
*15:25.560- 15:30.180* :  Right at World War I because of the threat of U-boats and submarines underwater and then slightly
*15:30.180- 15:35.040* :  before that with the sinking of the Titanic, there was this huge rush to try to figure out how we
*15:35.040- 15:40.700* :  could use underwater sound to discover threats, listen for threats and make shipping safer.
*15:41.240- 15:46.580* :  And as soon as we started developing the technology that led us overcome that problem of human
*15:46.580- 15:51.960* :  ears not really working in the water, all of a sudden there was this huge amount of sound that
*15:51.960- 15:57.120* :  we realized was happening. And one of those sounds was what's the first early submarineers called
*15:57.180- 16:04.780* :  Crackle. It sounded like crackling like rain, bacon or rain on a tin roof. And what this turned
*16:04.780- 16:10.680* :  it to be after decades of research was in fact fields of little shrimp that were snapping their
*16:10.680- 16:14.680* :  claws. They have these very very loud claws they're called snapping shrimp or pistol shrimp.
*16:15.200- 16:19.820* :  And we would clap their claws together and make a very loud popping bubble in order to defend
*16:19.820- 16:25.740* :  their little territories. There was a real step up in World War II with underwater networks of
*16:25.740- 16:30.580* :  hydrophones that were listening in the ocean and we were sending sound over longer and longer ranges
*16:30.580- 16:36.180* :  to try to ping off of enemy submarines. And the Americans had laid a string of hydrophones across
*16:36.180- 16:40.880* :  the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. That's where you'd go if you were going to go up by sea right to
*16:40.880- 16:45.900* :  Washington DC. And the problem was that around about April May all of a sudden the hydrophones were
*16:45.900- 16:57.960* :  drowned out with this humming noise. And at first people were quite worried and after some
*16:57.960- 17:03.260* :  extensive investigation they determined that in fact it was the kind of toadfish that hums
*17:03.260- 17:08.820* :  very very loudly for a mate and they do this every spring on mass. And unfortunately breeding toadfish
*17:08.880- 17:13.180* :  had drowned out these very strategically important hydrophones. And in fact the first real
*17:13.180- 17:19.440* :  systemic in-depth surveys of the sounds of underwater sea life were done by the military
*17:19.440- 17:25.220* :  precisely because they needed to have manuals of what these sounds were so that people didn't
*17:25.220- 17:30.660* :  inadvertently call in the big guns for what might turn out to be a thin whale or crackling shrimp
*17:30.660- 17:38.580* :  or something like that. Do we know how much the other animals underwater can hear these sounds?
*17:38.580- 17:44.620* :  We do. We can give fish for example hearing tests and we can generate audiograms so you can
*17:44.620- 17:49.660* :  kind of generate a line much like a human who's ever had a hearing test of what frequencies of fish
*17:49.660- 17:54.400* :  can hear and what sensitivities you can hear and you can do the same with marine mammals and you can
*17:54.400- 17:59.200* :  also kind of do the same for a lot of invertebrates and a squid but the end of the day we are still
*17:59.200- 18:04.740* :  learning a lot especially about the invertebrates. For example lobsters and muscles those animals can
*18:04.740- 18:09.120* :  very much detect sound but they don't do it with the same organs. I mean they don't have ears do they?
*18:09.260- 18:15.540* :  We have ears fish have ears but about 90% plus of the species in the ocean aren't vertebrates but they
*18:15.540- 18:19.720* :  still manage to detect sound and a lot of the ways that they do this is with organs called
*18:19.720- 18:24.400* :  statusists or anything that allows them to detect ballots because those organs that detect
*18:24.400- 18:29.540* :  balance they rely on motion and sound is just a pressure wave moving through the water.
*18:30.020- 18:35.120* :  How much is human activity then disturbing animals underwater?
*18:35.440- 18:39.840* :  It's hard to tell because by the time we started to really listen underwater in the past few
*18:39.860- 18:44.120* :  decades we'd already been making quite a lot of noise underwater with ships. There's just so
*18:44.120- 18:49.360* :  much constant 24 hour ship sound from shipping lanes that we don't really have a baseline of what
*18:49.360- 18:54.680* :  a ocean without our own sound is like shipping noise has doubled in the ocean every decade since the
*18:54.680- 18:59.580* :  1960s. But also because of global warming presumably those ships are traveling further north and
*18:59.580- 19:04.660* :  further south than they once did. Yes exactly so there are still areas of the ocean where
*19:05.020- 19:09.260* :  shipping noise hasn't really intruded quite so much one big area is the Arctic. So there's actually
*19:09.260- 19:14.300* :  a lot of effort right now to get what we would call baseline levels of sound and listening year
*19:14.300- 19:20.140* :  round for what animals are up there in what might be close to a somewhat pristine soundscape
*19:21.140- 19:26.200* :  so that if we do bring human industry into the Arctic we can at least kind of understand what
*19:26.200- 19:29.920* :  the animals were adapted to before we came and try to minimize our impact.
*19:31.960- 19:35.820* :  That was Amarina Kingdon author of the book Sing Like A Fish.
*19:39.000- 19:44.280* :  Still to come calls in Sweden for an end to the practice of fathers giving away their daughters
*19:44.280- 19:51.760* :  at weddings. I'm not so fond of bands. Sweden is quite an equal country to begin with. I think
*19:51.760- 19:53.920* :  that everyone deserves the wedding of their dreams.

*20:54.260- 20:58.640* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast. The Kenyan authorities say some of the children
*20:58.640- 21:03.880* :  who were missing after a devastating fire at a boys boarding school have now been found.
*21:04.360- 21:09.840* :  But a government spokesman says at least 21 boys are now confirmed to have died after flames
*21:09.840- 21:15.400* :  tore through the dormitory where they were sleeping on Friday. DNA tests need to be carried out on
*21:15.400- 21:21.880* :  some of the bodies as they're so badly burnt. Officials say 17 children remain unaccounted for.
*21:22.500- 21:28.280* :  The cause of the fire is still not known. Barbara Plattascha reports from the school in January
*21:28.280- 21:34.140* :  in central Kenya. Efforts to trace the missing boys continue. It's thought that some parents may
*21:34.140- 21:38.600* :  have picked up their children without reporting that they did so. It's also been suggested that some
*21:38.600- 21:43.060* :  boys may have taken refuge with members of the community who rushed to try and help put out the
*21:43.060- 21:49.920* :  fire. One woman at the school, Angela Kamani, said she's still looking for her 11-year-old nephew.
*21:49.920- 21:55.240* :  She'd been at a late-night church vigil nearby when the congregation heard the children's screams.
*21:59.580- 22:04.000* :  When we broke into the dormitory, there were some rescued, some unconscious, and some dead,
*22:04.000- 22:08.720* :  she says. We haven't found my nephew in hospitals and wonder if he's among those burned
*22:08.720- 22:14.500* :  beyond recognition. It's such a heavy load of grief for our family. That's the fear of many others.
*22:14.500- 22:20.060* :  DNA tests are needed to identify some of the remains. The authorities have also ordered an
*22:20.060- 22:27.540* :  investigation into the cause of the fire. Barbara Plattascha in Kenya. NASA officials say they fully
*22:27.540- 22:31.880* :  expect to continue working with Boeing in space despite the technical glitches suffered by the
*22:31.880- 22:36.940* :  company's Starliner spacecraft. The capsule returned to Earth from the International Space Station
*22:36.940- 22:41.760* :  this weekend, but the two astronauts it took up to the space station are now stuck there
*22:41.760- 22:47.820* :  until next year. Experts will now pour over the spacecraft data to decide when Starliner might
*22:47.820- 22:55.420* :  fly again. Our science editor, Rebecca Morrell, has more. Just a beautiful sight as Starliner makes
*22:55.420- 23:01.880* :  its way to the sands of New Mexico. Appearing in the night sky above the deserts of New Mexico,
*23:02.480- 23:06.820* :  Boeing's Starliner capsule descended to the ground beneath three huge parachutes.
*23:07.480- 23:12.560* :  The landing was successful and went to plan, apart from the fact the capsule was empty.
*23:13.300- 23:17.880* :  The astronauts it was supposed to carry, NASA's Butch Wilmore and Sunny Williams stayed behind
*23:17.880- 23:22.540* :  on the International Space Station. Sunny spoke to mission control before the capsule
*23:22.540- 23:28.660* :  nicknamed Calipso, undocked from the orbiting lab. You guys, it is the time to bring clips to
*23:28.660- 23:35.360* :  home. You have got this. We have your backs and you've got this bring your back to Earth.
*23:36.460- 23:41.880* :  Good luck. Boeing's capsule experienced helium leaks and problems with its thrusters after it
*23:41.880- 23:46.440* :  launched in June. And NASA decided it wasn't safe enough to bring the astronauts home.
*23:47.020- 23:51.920* :  Steve Stitch from the US Space Agency said the landing was a bittersweet moment for the Starliner
*23:51.920- 23:58.260* :  team. From a human perspective, all of us feel happy about the successful landing, but then there's
*23:58.260- 24:04.280* :  a piece of us, all of us, that we wish it would have been the way we had planned it. We had planned
*24:04.280- 24:09.920* :  to have the mission land with Butch and Sunny on board. I think there's depending on who you are
*24:09.920- 24:15.760* :  on the team, different emotions associated with that. It'll take a little time to determine the
*24:15.760- 24:20.600* :  path forward, but today we saw the vehicle perform really well. We've got some things we know we've
*24:20.600- 24:26.440* :  got to go work on and we'll go do that and fix those things and then go fly when we're ready.
*24:26.820- 24:31.680* :  Both Boeing and NASA will now be pouring over the data from this test flight. They'll need
*24:31.680- 24:37.080* :  to fix the technical problems before Starliner can fly again. Astronauts Butch and Sunny will
*24:37.080- 24:43.220* :  instead ride home with rival company SpaceX, but not until February next year, extending what
*24:43.220- 24:48.080* :  was supposed to be an eight day mission to eight months. But NASA says the pair are in good
*24:48.080- 24:52.320* :  spirits as they settle in for their much longer than anticipated stay in space.
*24:53.340- 24:58.400* :  Rebecca Morrell. When you think of traditional Christian weddings, you most probably think of a
*24:58.400- 25:03.800* :  bride walking down the aisle on the arm of her father to the accompaniment of a classic wedding march.
*25:11.780- 25:16.580* :  Well, that may no longer happen in Sweden. In a country where it's already common practice for
*25:16.580- 25:21.980* :  the bride and groom to walk down the aisle together, a motion to actually ban the practice of fathers
*25:21.980- 25:27.260* :  giving away their daughters at the altar has been submitted to the Protestant Lutheran Church by
*25:27.260- 25:33.260* :  a pastor in the city of Gothenburg who claims it's a symbol of the patriarchal system. Amanda
*25:33.260- 25:38.300* :  Kaplan got married in May. Julian Morricca asked her about her wedding and whether she'd known
*25:38.300- 25:44.600* :  about this Swedish tradition. We were aware of it when we started to plan our wedding more or less.
*25:44.660- 25:50.200* :  I mean, you've always seen the Hollywood movies with the bride walking down the aisle with a father,
*25:50.200- 25:56.320* :  but when we started planning it for real, then our priest told us about the Swedish tradition
*25:56.320- 26:02.780* :  and how it's usually done here and that it has a lot to do with the equality that you are going
*26:02.780- 26:08.480* :  into the marriage, both on your own willing, that you're not forced into do anything that you,
*26:08.660- 26:12.880* :  you were starting your life together and for that walking together down the aisle.
*26:13.020- 26:16.400* :  So was there ever a moment when you thought you might do it the Hollywood way?
*26:16.680- 26:22.220* :  Well, yeah, all of my childhood, you know, small girls dreaming about their wedding. I thought
*26:22.220- 26:27.260* :  that was the way that it was supposed to be done. And when you discussed it with the priest who
*26:27.260- 26:33.580* :  obviously presided over the ceremony, how did that discussion unfold? You always felt you had the
*26:33.580- 26:39.720* :  choice still presumably? Yeah, but he recommended it very forcefully so to speak. That's the way
*26:39.720- 26:45.860* :  that it should be done and stuff like that. He liked to refer to some words from the Bible,
*26:45.860- 26:52.860* :  actually, in Matthew 19. There's a saying that is, haven't you read? He replied that at the beginning,
*26:52.860- 26:59.120* :  the creator made the male and the female and said, for this reason, a man will leave his father
*26:59.120- 27:06.500* :  and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh. So he said that if anyone
*27:06.500- 27:12.060* :  should go with the parent on the aisle, it should be the groom. Now we have this situation where
*27:12.060- 27:19.420* :  a pastor in Gothenburg is putting forward a proposal for an actual ban on the bride arriving on
*27:19.420- 27:25.900* :  being walked down the aisle by her father because it's to do with a patriarchal symbolism that
*27:25.900- 27:31.700* :  that pastor would like to see Sweden get rid of. Do you see that a ban could work here that would
*27:31.700- 27:38.380* :  be applicable here? I'm not so fond of bans at all. I think that it should be up to yourself since
*27:38.380- 27:43.900* :  it's your day and not somebody else's. Then at the same time, you should pay your respect to the
*27:44.100- 27:50.040* :  church that you're in. You should pay your respect to the traditions, but if the priest is okay with
*27:50.040- 27:55.680* :  it and I think they should be, then I don't see why it should be a problem at all and I don't
*27:55.680- 28:02.300* :  really like the way of having someone else other than the ones marrying and maybe the priest deciding
*28:02.300- 28:09.580* :  how to do the ceremony. Sweden is quite an equal country to begin with. I think that everyone deserves
*28:09.580- 28:16.500* :  the wedding of their dreams. Amanda Carpland. The award-winning lyricist, Will Jennings, who worked with
*28:16.500- 28:21.680* :  artists such as Barry Manelow, Steve Wimwood and Randy Crawford, has died at the age of 80.
*28:21.940- 28:28.060* :  The American songwriter won a Grammy for Eric Clapton's Tears in Heaven and two Oscars for my heart

*28:45.020- 28:47.620* :  From Whitney Houston's, didn't we almost have it all?
*28:47.620- 29:00.380* :  To Steve Wimwood's higher love, Will Jennings wrote them all. In a career spanning five decades,
*29:00.380- 29:05.760* :  the man from the small town of Kilgore, Texas, wrote for a number of smash hit artists,
*29:06.440- 29:11.680* :  including BB King, Mariah Carey, Jimmy Buffett, Barry Manelow and Roy Orbison.
*29:18.100- 29:21.880* :  Jennings collaborated on a whole range of songs for film soundtracks,
*29:22.480- 29:28.740* :  bringing illustrious success in the process. It was in 1983 when he won his first Academy Award
*29:28.740- 29:34.980* :  for the song Up Where We Belong, sung by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Wands for an officer and a gentleman.
*29:48.300- 29:52.840* :  Fast forward eight years and he won a Grammy Award for writing lyrics to Eric Clapton's Tears
*29:52.840- 29:56.760* :  in Heaven for the film Rush, which was also nominated for a Golden Globe.
*30:07.300- 30:13.120* :  But above the more came the Celine Dion classic My Heart Will Go On, written for James Cameron's
*30:13.120- 30:19.100* :  Titanic, sweeping home a second Oscar, a Golden Globe and a Grammy Award in 1997.
*30:19.940- 30:25.440* :  In 2006, his legacy was cemented when he was inducted into the songwriter's hall of fame.
*30:26.300- 30:30.320* :  The singer Peter Wolf paid tribute to Jennings on social media, calling his friends,
*30:30.360- 30:36.160* :  a maestro, brilliant mind and a gentle spirit, who enriched his life in so many lives.
*30:40.980- 30:45.080* :  Guy Lambert with that look back on the life of the American lyricist Will Jennings,
