*01:16.940- 01:20.020* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:22.080- 01:26.680* :  I'm Andrew Patron in the early hours of Saturday the 14th of September. These are our main
*01:26.680- 01:32.020* :  stories. President Biden has met with Britain's Prime Minister to discuss whether to let Ukraine
*01:32.020- 01:37.740* :  fire Western long-range weapons at Russia. A military court and the Democratic Republic of Congo
*01:38.120- 01:42.540* :  has sentenced 37 people to death for taking part in an alleged coup attempt.
*01:43.240- 01:47.440* :  The footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has thought to be the first person ever to reach more than a
*01:47.480- 01:50.580* :  billion followers across all of his social media accounts.
*01:53.300- 01:58.120* :  Also in this podcast, I just want everybody to know how much we appreciate the concern for us
*01:58.860- 02:02.580* :  specifically. Every time I talk to someone that, hey, that we're praying for you, there's prayers
*02:02.580- 02:07.320* :  coming up for me and Sonny both. Street signs, people we don't even know across the nation.
*02:07.320- 02:11.940* :  Which will more one of two NASA astronauts stranded at the International Space Station
*02:11.940- 02:16.880* :  by technical problems with their Boeing spacecraft. They say they don't feel let down.
*02:20.160- 02:24.340* :  President Biden and the British Prime Minister have met at the White House with an appeal by
*02:24.340- 02:29.860* :  Ukraine to be allowed to fire Western supplied long-range weapons at targets in Russia on the agenda.
*02:30.500- 02:34.360* :  President Zelensky has said if Mr. Biden and Mr. Starmer give the go ahead,
*02:34.760- 02:39.200* :  Russia's missile launchers in the main logistics routes could be destroyed within months.
*02:39.200- 02:43.020* :  As they sat down in the White House before the media were instructed to leave,
*02:43.440- 02:45.940* :  the US President addressed the British Prime Minister.
*02:46.600- 02:52.800* :  Thank you for the UK leadership. The United States is just standing with you,
*02:53.440- 02:56.480* :  helping Ukraine as it defends against Russia's non-stop regression.
*02:56.480- 03:00.820* :  And it's clear that Putin will not make it clear that Putin will not prevail in this war.
*03:01.180- 03:05.840* :  After the meeting finished, Keir Starmer had this to say to journalists outside the White House.
*03:06.320- 03:11.100* :  We've had a long and productive discussion on a number of fronts, including Ukraine as you'd
*03:11.100- 03:16.600* :  expect, the Middle East, the Pacific, talking strategically about tactical decisions.
*03:16.780- 03:20.480* :  This isn't about a particular decision, and we'll obviously pick up again in
*03:20.840- 03:25.300* :  anger in just a few days' time with a wider group of individuals.
*03:25.300- 03:29.920* :  But this was a really important invitation for the President to have this level of discussion
*03:30.580- 03:35.000* :  about those critical issues. But with President Putin threatening war with NATO,
*03:35.480- 03:38.300* :  aren't you creating the impression that he's intimidating you?
*03:38.880- 03:42.600* :  Well, there's only one reason we're having these discussions, and that is because Putin has
*03:42.600- 03:48.780* :  illegally invaded Ukraine. And the quickest way to resolve this, obviously, lies through,
*03:49.260- 03:52.920* :  you know, what Putin actually does because it's for him to end this.
*03:53.200- 03:57.780* :  But we are having the discussion. We've stood with Ukraine. Ukraine has a right to self-defense,
*03:58.840- 04:04.840* :  and we've stood united, not just with our allies here in the US, but across with our NATO allies.
*04:04.840- 04:06.300* :  That's very, very important to us.
*04:06.660- 04:11.360* :  Now, before those comments bike here, Starmer, Sean Lay spoke to the BBC's political editor,
*04:11.360- 04:15.280* :  Chris Mason, who's travelling with the Prime Minister, and on the White House meeting,
*04:15.280- 04:18.880* :  the issue of Western long-range weapons he had this to say.
*04:19.280- 04:25.720* :  This question around missiles and Ukraine is being addressed, is being talked about.
*04:25.720- 04:30.240* :  I've just come from the blue room of the White House, John, where we were briefly invited
*04:30.240- 04:34.700* :  in for what's then as the spray, where reporters pile into a corner of the room. We hear some
*04:35.100- 04:39.440* :  broad-based words from the principles, as they're known, the Prime Minister and the
*04:39.880- 04:44.040* :  President, re-then shout a wall of noise of questions, most of which are ignored, and then we're
*04:44.040- 04:49.060* :  kicked out. And then they start their talks proper. The canvas is wider than just missiles,
*04:49.100- 04:52.940* :  and the canvas is wider than just Ukraine. They will talk about the Middle East, they will talk
*04:52.940- 05:01.540* :  about China and AI and trade. But yes, the question around missile deployment is there,
*05:01.540- 05:08.740* :  and there is a subtlety of difference between two of Kiev's closest allies. There is a skepticism
*05:08.740- 05:16.060* :  in the White House, particularly around the deployment of US missiles by Ukraine into Russia.
*05:16.560- 05:21.860* :  The UK has been making an argument about the deployments of Stormshadow, these are Anglo-French
*05:21.920- 05:28.260* :  missiles, and it would appear in the diplomacy that there is an attempt to get to a place where
*05:28.820- 05:34.840* :  Ukraine's allies can line up behind a position where perhaps some of these missiles are granted
*05:34.840- 05:40.780* :  authorization for deployment, probably the Anglo-French ones, but perhaps not the American ones,
*05:40.780- 05:47.240* :  but with all sides amongst the allies, maintaining a common public position. Welcome to the
*05:47.280- 05:51.340* :  complex world of international diplomacy. Some would call it compromise, others would
*05:51.340- 05:56.600* :  call it a fudge, but it's probably the reality of a major alliance, like NATO. No
*05:56.600- 06:01.480* :  announcement then expected imminently on this, but do you think it is getting close?
*06:01.700- 06:06.880* :  I think we are getting ever closer to it, yes. I don't think there won't be any announcements
*06:06.960- 06:11.960* :  tonight. It is possible, Sean, that there never will be an announcement, because today has proven
*06:12.420- 06:16.880* :  something that is obvious, but nonetheless, when you see it, it is there to observe, which is that
*06:16.880- 06:21.600* :  words matter too. We've seen Moscow picking today to make that announcement about the
*06:21.600- 06:27.980* :  expulsion of British diplomats. That is no coincidence. It happened several weeks ago, so an
*06:27.980- 06:33.880* :  announcement itself would be perceived as provocative. I think, as and when a decision is taken,
*06:34.260- 06:39.320* :  the first we're likely to know about it is when one of these weapons is deployed in Russia.
*06:39.800- 06:44.940* :  Chris Mason at the White House in Washington. President Putin has said NATO would be directly
*06:44.940- 06:50.620* :  involving itself in the war by allowing Ukraine to use those long-range missiles inside Russia,
*06:51.000- 06:55.540* :  because they'd need to use the alliance's satellites to find the targets. At the U.N.
*06:55.540- 07:00.380* :  Security Council, Russia's ambassador, Vasily Nabenzia, echoed that statement and reminded
*07:00.380- 07:05.860* :  members that Russia is a nuclear power, more from our security correspondent Gordon Carrera.
*07:06.640- 07:11.220* :  Stormshadow missiles would be launched from Ukrainian fighter jets with the trigger pulled by
*07:11.220- 07:17.920* :  Ukrainians, so why does Vladimir Putin claim their use with mean NATO was directly involved in the war?
*07:18.440- 07:23.120* :  Part of the answer may come from the way the missiles are targeted. They rely on being programmed
*07:23.120- 07:27.900* :  with data about the terrain they fly over, and the U.S. tends to be the main provider of the
*07:27.900- 07:33.100* :  kind of satellite and imagery data required. But the truth is that the provision of Western
*07:33.100- 07:38.740* :  intelligence for Ukraine's operations has long been known to Moscow, even if it's little spoken
*07:38.740- 07:45.000* :  of by Western governments. And Stormshadow itself has already been used in Crimea, which Russia annexed
*07:45.000- 07:51.400* :  in 2014 and considers its own territory. Western spies say President Putin uses saber
*07:51.400- 07:57.040* :  rattling to sow division and doubt in his adversaries, but believe he has no interest in an all-out
*07:57.040- 08:01.960* :  war with NATO. So the notion that the use of Stormshadow crosses a red line,
*08:01.960- 08:06.960* :  significantly different from those that he has drawn in the past, and which NATO has already
*08:06.960- 08:13.720* :  crossed, has been met with skepticism. Next to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 37 people
*08:13.720- 08:18.660* :  have been sentenced to death by a military court, they were all accused by the authorities of
*08:18.660- 08:24.640* :  taking part in an attempted coup. 14 people were acquitted. Our Afrika regional editor Will Ross
*08:24.640- 08:30.340* :  told me more about what the group were supposed to have done. We believe that the 37 people were all
*08:30.340- 08:37.160* :  arrested, the authorities said, in or very near the president's office, and it was this office
*08:37.160- 08:43.680* :  back in May that was taken over briefly by this group of armed men, in what the authorities are
*08:43.680- 08:48.700* :  saying was a coup attempt. They were armed, and in fact, the whole event at one point was live
*08:48.700- 08:55.420* :  streamed on social media by the supposed ringleader Christian Malanga. He was actually killed by
*08:55.420- 09:02.440* :  security forces, but then went to this trial, which is in a military prison on the outskirts of
*09:02.440- 09:09.360* :  the capital, Kinshasa, under a tent, and there were scenes of jubilation. People very excited when
*09:09.360- 09:16.600* :  they were acquitted and set free at 14 of them, and the 37 we understand have five days to appeal
*09:16.600- 09:23.420* :  against these death sentences. Some of the defendants said they were forced into taking part by
*09:23.420- 09:28.780* :  Christian Malanga, the leader of this coup, who is no longer with us. You're right, the son
*09:29.020- 09:37.700* :  of Christian Malanga, who's called Marcel, who's, I think, 21 years of age. During the trial,
*09:38.280- 09:44.360* :  he told the court that his own father had threatened to kill him if he didn't take part in the coup.
*09:45.020- 09:49.920* :  It was an extraordinary plot, and Christian Malanga's described as a Congolese politician,
*09:50.000- 09:54.960* :  but he's not very well known, but he talked about being the president of a new
*09:55.620- 10:02.060* :  Zaire, and there are also other nationals, including a British passport holder, Yusuf Izanghi,
*10:02.060- 10:07.560* :  and the court said that he had tried to recruit some of the others who took part in the coup attempt.
*10:08.160- 10:13.680* :  Will Ross reporting. The NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sonny Williams left for the International
*10:13.680- 10:19.040* :  Space Station in Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on the 5th of June. They were supposed to be there
*10:19.040- 10:24.240* :  for eight days, but after technical problems, their spacecraft returned to Earth without them,
*10:24.540- 10:29.560* :  and I'm expecting to come home in February. On Friday, they spoke for the first time from the
*10:29.580- 10:35.600* :  ISS in an Earth-to-Space call, answering questions from journalists. I just want everybody to know how
*10:35.600- 10:40.760* :  much we appreciate the concern for us specifically. Every time I talk to someone that, hey,
*10:40.760- 10:45.320* :  that we're praying for you, there's prayers coming up for me and Sonny both. Street signs,
*10:45.320- 10:49.580* :  people we don't even know across the nation. Sonny and Butch were praying for you. Come on back,
*10:49.600- 10:54.560* :  all those things. And I can tell you, it really goes a long way. You asked what we missed,
*10:54.560- 10:58.600* :  right? Of course, you know, the things that we always miss, our families. I miss my two dogs,
*10:58.600- 11:03.440* :  I miss my friends. But you know what? Everybody understands, and everybody's cheering for us to get
*11:03.440- 11:11.340* :  back with Krunai. 90% of our training is preparing for the unexpected. And sometimes the actual
*11:11.660- 11:16.500* :  unexpected goes beyond what you even think that could happen. And that's just the way it goes
*11:16.500- 11:22.480* :  sometimes, because we are pushing the edges of the envelope and everything that we do,
*11:22.920- 11:27.960* :  and it is not easy. This is the first time that we've had humans in space and starliner,
*11:27.960- 11:33.420* :  and we did find stuff, and you know, we made the right decisions and we're here, and that's how it
*11:33.420- 11:37.720* :  goes in the business. The things that I can't control, I'm not going to fret over it. There's no
*11:37.720- 11:44.180* :  benefit to it at all. So we march forward, carry out the plan of the day. My husband has said that,
*11:44.180- 11:49.980* :  my mom has said it before too. This is my happy place. I love being up here in space. It's just
*11:50.320- 11:56.000* :  fun. You know, every day you do something that's work, quote unquote, you can do it upside down,
*11:56.000- 12:01.480* :  you can do it sideways. So it adds a little different perspective. You know, we're living in a
*12:01.480- 12:06.940* :  remote area, but we're doing world-class science as well as, you know, living with other people,
*12:06.940- 12:11.620* :  you know, for the betterment of so much, and you know, being able to have a perspective out the
*12:11.620- 12:16.740* :  window as well as a perspective upside down or sideways is something that I, I hope we can pass
*12:16.740- 12:21.700* :  on to the rest of humanity. NASA, astronaut, sunny Williams, and butch Wilmore.
*12:24.040- 12:28.220* :  Still to come in this podcast? I have been on Bumble, I've been on
*12:28.280- 12:35.220* :  LOXY, I've been on, what's called? Does this other app compete? I am single. I've been on date,
*12:35.220- 12:39.560* :  but nothing. I'll be called disillusioned with online dating apps.
*12:47.780- 12:51.680* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mid-Mobile. With the price of just about everything going up during
*12:51.680- 12:57.360* :  inflation, we thought we'd bring our prices down. So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer,

*14:17.260- 14:22.580* :  Most notorious drug lords in Latin American history appeared in court in Brooklyn to plead
*14:22.580- 14:28.460* :  not guilty to the drug trafficking charges against him. In total, there were 17 charges from drug
*14:28.460- 14:34.180* :  smuggling to money laundering and weapons charges. He will face a mandatory life sentence if convicted.
*14:35.040- 14:39.940* :  Now in his 70s, it was thought that Zambada might successfully evade capture in Mexico,
*14:39.940- 14:45.880* :  as he was renowned for being more careful than his cartel co-founder Huakim El Chapo Guzman.
*14:46.980- 14:51.800* :  Financial police in Italy, so they're broken up a gang that trafficked fake vintage video game
*14:51.800- 14:57.940* :  consoles made in China. Nine Italians have been arrested. The counterfeit devices contain popular
*14:57.940- 15:03.960* :  games from the 1980s and 90s, including Street Fighter and Star Wars. There is a current trend
*15:03.960- 15:08.420* :  for what's been called retro gaming, with vintage games soaring in popularity.
*15:09.100- 15:13.120* :  Julian Marshall spoke to Jay MacDonald, founder of the website RetroGames Start.
*15:13.860- 15:20.060* :  I grew up on the classic console starting in the 70s, and then it was in 2018. I started
*15:20.460- 15:25.200* :  getting interested again and wanted to share the experience with my daughter. It was a teenager.
*15:26.000- 15:31.940* :  And what I found was she genuinely enjoyed them having known nostalgia for them, but just
*15:32.280- 15:37.780* :  having fun. But the technology is a little primitive, isn't it compared to modern video game
*15:37.780- 15:45.720* :  consoles? Absolutely, yeah, it is. And that limitation is a plus because it forced game makers
*15:45.720- 15:53.640* :  to be more creative in certain ways. And also the advancement of technology is kind of a poor yardstick
*15:54.260- 15:59.960* :  for measuring the successful design of a game, whether it's actually enjoyable or not,
*15:59.960- 16:04.880* :  whether it's engaging and serves a good purpose. We've kind of been lulled into this idea that
*16:04.880- 16:10.000* :  everything needs to advance, become faster, more high resolution. And that benefits certain
*16:10.000- 16:14.680* :  types of gameplay, but there are other things that it just doesn't really do much for.
*16:15.140- 16:18.840* :  These RetroGames, they're cheaper, I would imagine, than the modern ones.
*16:19.640- 16:23.500* :  Typically, yes, prices all over the board, there are a lot of people who've gotten in because of
*16:24.060- 16:29.940* :  speculation and collecting, and so certain prices have gone up. But if you're just going to go out and
*16:29.940- 16:36.180* :  buy a used vintage cartridge somewhere, yes, definitely. I mean, you're surprised that there
*16:36.480- 16:42.940* :  appears to be this vast market for the fake vintage video game consoles.
*16:43.800- 16:49.860* :  Well, I'm not surprised in that RetroGaming has become a real trend. What I am surprised about
*16:49.980- 16:56.660* :  is why aren't the copyright holders meeting this market need? As someone who makes a living in
*16:56.660- 17:01.740* :  the creative space, I believe in copyright law, and I think that IP law should be respected.
*17:01.740- 17:07.440* :  And I'm not an advocate for piracy, but I do understand that there are people who want access
*17:07.440- 17:14.780* :  to things and the companies that are the actual holders of all these properties don't seem to be
*17:15.580- 17:18.360* :  giving people what they're looking for. They get a little bit here, a little bit there,
*17:18.980- 17:24.220* :  but it would be nice if they would just recognize that there's this market and be more robust about
*17:24.220- 17:30.340* :  how they engage with it. So you think games companies should make more of these games available,
*17:30.340- 17:37.100* :  and that would put an end to the fake market? Well, you're always going to have a price game,
*17:37.860- 17:44.240* :  the multi-cart that's hundreds of games or whatever it is. That's always going to price undercut
*17:44.660- 17:50.680* :  something that a legitimate company will sell, but I think it would reduce that level of interest
*17:50.680- 17:55.860* :  because it's a better experience if you can get a real console, a real cartridge that is
*17:55.860- 18:01.120* :  legitimately produced and high quality. Retro game enthusiast, James McDonald.
*18:01.180- 18:06.420* :  The Portuguese football Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first person on earth to have a total
*18:06.420- 18:11.840* :  of a billion followers on social media. This number is calculated by combining his total number of
*18:11.840- 18:17.840* :  followers on sites, including Instagram and Facebook. Here's Andrew Ochen. When Cristiano Ronaldo
*18:17.840- 18:23.100* :  joined YouTube last month, his channel rocketed to 50 million subscribers within a week.
*18:23.640- 18:27.320* :  That's believed to have boosted his online presence. The total number of his followers
*18:27.320- 18:32.280* :  across social media has been calculated by combining the totals from six platforms,
*18:32.760- 18:38.820* :  including the Chinese sites, Weibo and Quasho. This huge popularity online is mostly due to his
*18:38.820- 18:43.960* :  achievements on the football field. Ronaldo is the top scorer in UEFA Champions League history,
*18:43.960- 18:48.980* :  and last week he became the first footballer to score 900 top-level career goals.
*18:49.580- 18:54.280* :  According to Forbes magazine, he is also the highest paid athlete this year, making around
*18:54.280- 19:01.200* :  $260 million. Taking impressive photographs of animals in the wild requires skill,
*19:01.200- 19:07.940* :  patience and timing. Doing it underwater makes it all the harder. The ocean photographer of the
*19:07.940- 19:13.480* :  year competition captures the wonders of the deep sea with more than 15,000 photos submitted
*19:13.480- 19:20.040* :  and the top prize captured a brutal swale of the coast of northwest Mexico with its mouth wide open.
*19:20.440- 19:24.680* :  Brutus Wells are named after the Norwegian who built the first wailing stations in South Africa
*19:24.680- 19:29.920* :  in the early 20th century. In each of them, they spoke to the winning photographer Rafael Fernández
*19:29.920- 19:35.660* :  Keberiah. That area during the last part of the year, during that season, it has a huge migration
*19:35.660- 19:41.060* :  of sardines. So basically what we are trying to get there are the predators around the bait balls,
*19:41.060- 19:45.980* :  around the balls of sardines, eating and predating from that. And the biggest you can find,
*19:45.980- 19:50.520* :  it's a huge whale, it's so difficult, but luckily we got it, so I'll drink it through.
*19:50.740- 19:56.440* :  There are not so many, it's not easy to see and to see it eating from from that, it's an ever
*19:56.440- 20:02.600* :  more complicated situation. So I think it's once in a lifetime and we were lucky to see it, even
*20:02.600- 20:08.960* :  several times this year, but it was something that I might not even see in my life, so very lucky.
*20:09.640- 20:14.980* :  So how long did you spend around this particular time in the waters of the Pacific coast
*20:14.980- 20:21.360* :  trying to get these fantastic images? So from the sunrise till the end of the day,
*20:21.360- 20:27.560* :  every day for the season that might be around two months, and I have been doing this for a few
*20:27.560- 20:32.760* :  years. So as I say, it was something that I was hearing that some people was getting, but I was
*20:32.760- 20:38.480* :  not expecting to get it and you need to be out there and spend a lot of time and effort to get
*20:38.480- 20:43.360* :  that moment, I mean, ready also to photograph it. So two months out of each year for several
*20:43.360- 20:47.360* :  years, that's really interesting just to get that kind of detail and get an idea of the kind of
*20:47.360- 20:52.460* :  work that goes into getting an image like this. So when you looked at this shot afterwards,
*20:52.460- 20:57.880* :  did you think to yourself, this is a really special shot? For sure, we knew that the moment was
*20:57.880- 21:03.180* :  super special because everything was perfect. The bowl of sardines was not in the
*21:03.180- 21:09.380* :  shallow water, it was four or five meters deep, then I was great. So when we got back to land,
*21:09.420- 21:14.500* :  I checked the pictures and my friends told me that the picture was really powerful. I was with
*21:14.500- 21:22.000* :  some photographers and we might say that we kind of knew it. Now recently on the Global News podcast,
*21:22.000- 21:28.640* :  we reported an unusual way of dating by going to the supermarket. This Spanish craze has been
*21:28.640- 21:34.200* :  encouraging single people to seek partners in the food shops by using a fruit-based code in
*21:34.200- 21:39.260* :  their choice. If you're available, put an upside down pineapple in with your groceries.
*21:39.980- 21:44.260* :  This new venture has been brought about by a disillusionment with online dating apps.
*21:44.720- 21:49.820* :  Luke Jones has been talking to Malia, a Canadian in Bali, Mark and Irish Guy in the Netherlands,
*21:49.820- 21:54.300* :  and Faith and I, Jerry and woman in the UK. So how single are they?
*21:54.980- 22:02.400* :  I am very more single like. My single is super single. My life is screaming single.
*22:02.780- 22:09.420* :  So I have been on Bumble, I've been on age, I've been on Luxe, I've been on WhatsApp,
*22:09.420- 22:15.700* :  does this other app compete? Yes, I've been on those apps in the last one year. I am single.
*22:15.700- 22:19.780* :  I have been on dates, but nothing. Message you saved, Mark?
*22:19.780- 22:24.100* :  Yeah, okay, good. I don't know. I'm like that single. I guess I am in for a year.
*22:25.680- 22:30.540* :  Yeah, I guess I'm more or less the same. I was in a relationship with someone that I met on a
*22:30.540- 22:36.260* :  dating app actually last year, up until March of this year. I mean, yeah, I've been on Bumble,
*22:36.300- 22:41.180* :  Hinge, Tinder, and there's another one called Field. I tried that for a while.
*22:41.340- 22:45.120* :  Then broadly, if anyone has never heard of any of these things, I mean, generally,
*22:45.260- 22:51.040* :  a lot of nonsense if I'm honest. No, but practically speaking. You're sort of flicking through
*22:51.040- 22:53.940* :  pictures of people and saying, oh, I like the look of them or I don't have them. Yeah, there
*22:53.940- 22:58.500* :  are more or less the same. Everybody has a little profile and it's the name really six pictures
*22:58.500- 23:02.960* :  of yourself that you think you look good in and a few interests and you try and write a bio and
*23:02.960- 23:06.680* :  you just it's very vain. You have to just swipe left or right. The worst thing about this
*23:06.680- 23:11.300* :  baking app, you need to pay for a subscription for you to see how comfortable it's like to you.
*23:14.180- 23:18.520* :  Malay here, what about you? So I recently just got out of a relationship, which is
*23:18.880- 23:24.480* :  met organically, but prior to it took a while because I refused to go on dating apps,
*23:25.120- 23:29.740* :  but what I find funny is that it's a lot like the pot calling the cuddle black. I feel like
*23:29.740- 23:35.920* :  everyone that has involved the dating apps likes to write them off, but I do agree with faith.
*23:35.920- 23:41.680* :  It used to be a lot better. I've had really good experiences where people have literally
*23:41.680- 23:49.300* :  moved across the world that I've met through dating apps, but yes, recently I feel like it's just
*23:49.560- 23:53.840* :  a way for people to get quick validation. They get out of a relationship and it's like, okay,
*23:53.840- 23:59.000* :  let me just fill the void really quickly. And it's really hard to sift through that nonsense.
*23:59.000- 24:05.120* :  I'm not saying that everyone is like that. We've all been on dating apps, so surely there's people
*24:05.120- 24:10.600* :  on there looking for something authentic, but majority, it's yeah, that's what you're facing.
*24:11.220- 24:16.060* :  I just I just feel like the guys on dating app right now, they are not looking for someone to date.
*24:16.060- 24:20.800* :  They feel like, okay, when they're going to app, they could swipe 10 ladies, they could add 10
*24:20.800- 24:25.280* :  ladies out on dates, they could tell them, I want you to come over to my place, so they don't have
*24:25.280- 24:30.140* :  to go through the organic way to asking you out, getting to know you, they're just very straight
*24:30.140- 24:35.420* :  up. This is what I want in a woman. I have met a guy on a dating app that he did not tell me,
*24:35.420- 24:40.040* :  we're talking for like a week, and this guy literally was supposed to meet her for a date.
*24:40.040- 24:44.520* :  I'm on the day of the date, he told me that he wants to come pick me up. I was like, don't worry,
*24:44.520- 24:48.680* :  because I don't like giving strangers my address. I would come to the location. Then he started
*24:48.680- 24:54.580* :  reading and then this guy said, should I come over to yours? I was like, no, and I could hear a girl's
*24:54.580- 24:58.440* :  voice in the background. And I said, sorry, who's that? He said, oh my girlfriend, she stays
*24:59.980- 25:06.960* :  up. And this is not made up. This is not made up. And you are on a date, it's got a dating app.
*25:07.600- 25:16.340* :  And I was like, or does she? Oh my God. I don't have anything like that. No, thankfully not actually.
*25:16.340- 25:20.040* :  Yeah, I didn't have anything that exciting. Well, what was your worst being like Mark?
*25:21.100- 25:25.420* :  There was one like at the start of the summer, I met somebody, went on a date together,
*25:26.020- 25:31.120* :  was very nice, really hit it off. They invited me back at theirs and were like, they want to sleep
*25:31.120- 25:36.040* :  with you, but at a nice time, if you want to stay over, I said, sure. The next week, we had a
*25:36.040- 25:39.860* :  range of another date and then they randomly texted me, I was finishing work and they said, text me
*25:39.860- 25:43.920* :  like 11 at night and said, hey, what if I, they lived in a different city? What if I got a train
*25:43.920- 25:48.980* :  to visit you now and stayed over? And I was like, yeah, sure, fine, let's do it. They came to my house
*25:48.980- 25:54.380* :  like 12, 30 at night. They stayed for like 36 hours and then they ghosted me for a weekend and then
*25:54.380- 26:00.280* :  said they don't want to see me again. Well, there she said that. Yeah, I think we should just leave
*26:00.280- 26:04.820* :  it there and I said, okay, well, all the signs were kind of pointing the opposite direction. May I
*26:04.820- 26:10.480* :  ask why? And she said, yeah, I just, you know, wasn't feeling it. I'm thinking, you stayed for like
*26:10.480- 26:16.600* :  from Thursday night to Saturday morning. What a what's it when you're not feeling it? I was Mark,
*26:16.600- 26:20.260* :  Malia and Faith with Luke Jones on online dating.
*26:23.000- 26:26.600* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
