*00:16.900- 00:21.620* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*00:21.620- 00:22.960* :  prices due to inflation.
*00:22.960- 00:23.980* :  They said yes.
*00:23.980- 00:28.700* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts, they
*00:28.700- 00:32.500* :  said, what the f**k are you talking about, you insane Hollywood s**t?

*01:19.940- 01:26.720* :  I'm Nikki Cardwell and at 1,400 GMT on Thursday 19 September, these are our main stories.
*01:27.560- 01:32.400* :  The Civil Aviation Authority in Lebanon has banned pages and walkie talkies from all
*01:32.400- 01:37.600* :  flights out of Bate Route Airport following the targeting of Hezbollah's communication devices.
*01:38.180- 01:41.880* :  There have been more exchanges of fire between Israel and the militants.
*01:42.400- 01:47.260* :  The Israeli Security Services say they've arrested an Israeli businessman allegedly recruited
*01:47.260- 01:50.420* :  by Iran to assassinate Prime Minister Netanyahu.
*01:52.480- 01:57.940* :  Also in this podcast, artificial intelligence needs global oversight and developing nation's
*01:57.940- 02:00.100* :  need of voice according to the United Nations.
*02:00.840- 02:05.540* :  And the late billionaire and former Harrods boss, Muhammad Al-Faird, is accused of rape
*02:05.660- 02:06.540* :  by former staff.
*02:06.800- 02:11.020* :  He was trying to get in my room in quite an aggressive manner, it was absolutely terrifying.
*02:11.140- 02:12.560* :  We have a special report.
*02:17.100- 02:21.980* :  The authorities in Israel say an Israeli businessman is being held in custody over an
*02:21.980- 02:25.000* :  extraordinary plot to assassinate leading politicians.
*02:25.260- 02:31.860* :  The Security Services alleged 72-year-old Motti Maman traveled to Iran twice and was paid
*02:31.860- 02:37.000* :  to kill the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Defence Minister or the Director of the
*02:37.000- 02:38.480* :  Domestic Security Agency.
*02:39.060- 02:41.240* :  Sharon Benjamin is a senior police officer.
*02:45.660- 02:50.640* :  An incident that sets a new bar of severity and audacity that we've not yet known.
*02:51.000- 02:55.480* :  We're talking about an Israeli who, during a war, during the State of Israel's toughest
*02:55.480- 03:01.420* :  time, enters Iran, holds a meeting with Iranian intelligence agents who ask him to help
*03:01.420- 03:05.080* :  in a plan to assassinate senior figures in the State of Israel.
*03:06.300- 03:12.060* :  Northern border in Lebanon, there's continuing turmoil after two consecutive days of exploding
*03:12.880- 03:13.560* :  communications devices.
*03:13.660- 03:19.040* :  Both pages and walkie-talkies have now been banned on flights out of Bayrood's airports.
*03:19.580- 03:24.260* :  Now, Jets Aliba is a member of the Lebanese Parliament with the coalition Takadam.
*03:24.640- 03:27.100* :  What are her feelings after the two waves of attacks?
*03:27.960- 03:33.520* :  So the first one is sadness, because of the number of injured people.
*03:33.920- 03:40.900* :  The second is an all of how destructive this massacre was.
*03:41.580- 03:49.980* :  And the third is also some kind of disparity of what is next and how bad does it get?
*03:50.740- 03:53.260* :  A correspondent in Jerusalem is Yolanda Nell.
*03:53.260- 03:57.920* :  Alex Ritson began by asking her about that alleged assassination plot.
*03:58.600- 04:02.920* :  An Israeli court has actually lifted today a gag order on this spying case.
*04:03.500- 04:09.580* :  I'm revealing that this man, Mottima Man, a 72-year-old Jewish Israeli from Ashkelon in
*04:09.580- 04:16.320* :  the South has been charged with being recruited by Iran to assassinate senior Israeli officials,
*04:16.420- 04:22.840* :  including the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Defence Minister, or that the
*04:22.840- 04:24.980* :  head of the Shinbet spy agency.
*04:25.560- 04:32.200* :  And really, you know, he's said to have attended at least two meetings in Iran himself, who
*04:32.200- 04:37.280* :  is somebody who'd been working as a businessman in Turkey for quite a lot of time.
*04:37.280- 04:42.300* :  And it's a really intriguing case that just reminds you of the ongoing shadow war between
*04:42.380- 04:44.660* :  Israel and Iran.
*04:45.100- 04:51.680* :  Last week, we had the Shinbet uncovering what it said was a plot by Hezbollah as an Iranian
*04:52.520- 04:56.180* :  backed group to assassinate the former Defence Minister Moshe Yalon.
*04:57.160- 05:03.040* :  This perhaps puts current events, though, into a wider context, because although we
*05:03.040- 05:07.640* :  only just found out about it, the leaders of Israel would have known about this as they
*05:07.640- 05:10.000* :  were planning all the current series of actions.
*05:11.340- 05:11.620* :  Indeed.
*05:11.620- 05:14.380* :  There's just so much that's going on at the moment.
*05:14.900- 05:20.600* :  I have to say, though, on the ground, away from this assassination plot, as much as tensions
*05:20.600- 05:26.840* :  remain extremely high after the attack on the Hezbollah communication devices that's
*05:26.840- 05:32.800* :  been attributed to Mosad, although Israel is not officially commenting, not saying that
*05:32.800- 05:36.260* :  its spy agency was behind that in any way.
*05:37.480- 05:41.360* :  We've got on the ground events that look very similar to what we've seen over the past
*05:41.360- 05:42.080* :  11 months.
*05:42.620- 05:47.600* :  We've been hearing from the Israeli military that it carried out airstrikes hitting Hezbollah
*05:49.080- 05:49.100* :  targets.
*05:49.100- 05:53.880* :  In southern Lebanon, Israeli media reporting that a number of Israelis have been wounded
*05:53.880- 06:02.460* :  by anti-tank missile fire from Lebanon, and yesterday Hezbollah fired about 20 different
*06:02.460- 06:08.580* :  rockets into Israel, most of which were intercepted by the air defense systems without causing any
*06:08.580- 06:11.120* :  injuries, according to what the Israeli military has told us.
*06:11.240- 06:19.080* :  It does feel like Israel has stepped up its war aims by at least one gear.
*06:20.180- 06:24.220* :  Well, the Israeli Defense Minister has said this is a new phase of operations.
*06:24.980- 06:30.120* :  Israel's not making it clear if it's expecting to go to all out war with Hezbollah or just
*06:30.120- 06:33.120* :  increase its focus on that northern border.
*06:33.120- 06:38.200* :  It's been adding troops, a whole division that was recently fighting in Gaza that includes
*06:39.320- 06:41.080* :  mandos and paratroopers.
*06:41.940- 06:49.480* :  It's put more military resources along that border, and it's really been emphasizing different
*06:49.480- 06:53.560* :  leaders coming out saying they're committed to this new war goal that they have set of
*06:53.560- 06:59.260* :  returning tens of thousands of displaced Israeli citizens to their homes in the north, and
*06:59.260- 07:04.760* :  previously the indications of being that Israel was wanting to push Hezbollah away from
*07:04.760- 07:05.140* :  the border.
*07:05.300- 07:07.300* :  That could involve a ground assault.
*07:07.980- 07:12.340* :  As we recorded this podcast, the head of Hezbollah was due to give us speech following
*07:12.340- 07:13.720* :  the blasts in recent days.
*07:13.720- 07:17.820* :  We'll bring you the latest developments in the next edition of the Global News Podcast.
*07:17.940- 07:22.860* :  For this assessment of what might happen next, my colleague Nick Robinson spoke to our
*07:22.860- 07:24.820* :  international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
*07:25.360- 07:30.360* :  I'm picking up from people I'm speaking to that there's a great deal of concern, including
*07:30.360- 07:35.420* :  among Israel's Western allies, that the moment that people have feared for a long time
*07:35.420- 07:42.260* :  a wider Middle East war is looming, and that, of course, has been, you know, an argument
*07:42.260- 07:46.460* :  well rehearsed over the months, and that, of course, might have catastrophic consequences
*07:46.460- 07:51.460* :  for, well, not just people in the region, but it will have reverberations across the globe
*07:51.460- 07:52.060* :  if it happens.
*07:52.140- 07:53.020* :  That's hope it doesn't.
*07:53.120- 07:55.380* :  Reverberations around the globe in what way?
*07:55.800- 08:01.680* :  Well, I think the history shows that events that happen in the Middle East tend not to stay
*08:01.680- 08:06.320* :  in the Middle East, and you can't predict exactly the way it's going to work out.
*08:06.320- 08:12.380* :  But there are always vibrations and consequences in terms of movements of people, in terms
*08:13.260- 08:18.520* :  of organizations taking action against, say, for example, allies of Israel.
*08:18.860- 08:26.000* :  I was in Lebanon in the war in 2006, and also an earlier large-scale Israeli attack in
*08:26.000- 08:32.440* :  1996, Israel has a long record of intervening in Lebanon, and actually a long record of having
*08:32.440- 08:38.260* :  to retreat because it hasn't gone the way that they hoped for, and the 1982 war was
*08:38.260- 08:41.500* :  called Operation Peace for Galilee by the Israelis.
*08:42.160- 08:47.580* :  The US fears that the wider war might happen and that they might get dragged in, they have
*08:47.580- 08:53.220* :  a diplomatic plan, an envoy who's been working, assiduously over the month, to try to bring
*08:53.220- 08:59.280* :  it to fruition, and while he has a framework, it depends, really, I think, from his
*08:59.280- 09:04.960* :  bullar side on whether or not there is a ceasefire in Gaza, these things are connected, and
*09:04.960- 09:08.900* :  the efforts to get a ceasefire in Gaza are not bearing fruit.
*09:09.500- 09:13.780* :  So the Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that it's imperative all parties refrain
*09:13.780- 09:17.740* :  from any actions that could escalate the conflict, but clearly at the moment Israel has
*09:17.740- 09:18.720* :  been escalating.
*09:18.720- 09:24.820* :  There were those assassinations in Beirut and in Tehran earlier in the summer, and the
*09:24.820- 09:29.400* :  last two days there's been a really significant escalation by the Israelis, and also their
*09:29.400- 09:33.940* :  rhetoric has gone up a notch as well, and they're moving troops to the border.
*09:34.360- 09:39.740* :  Now these may be precautions, and they may simply be demonstrations and part of a great
*09:39.740- 09:45.380* :  game of trying to put pressure on them on his bullar without taking military action.
*09:45.880- 09:51.900* :  But the fact is that you can't keep an international affairs, you can't keep going to the brink,
*09:52.680- 09:57.620* :  which has happened repeatedly over the last year, without the risk that you might tumble
*09:57.620- 09:58.180* :  over it.
*09:58.720- 10:02.760* :  Events in the Middle East are playing a big role in the U.S. presidential election and
*10:02.760- 10:08.020* :  their special attention being paid in Michigan, which has a large Arab-American population.
*10:08.020- 10:13.100* :  It's also one of the crucial swing states which will determine whether Kamala Harris or
*10:13.100- 10:17.460* :  Donald Trump will be the next president, with polling suggesting the race between the
*10:17.460- 10:20.260* :  two is very close, every vote will count.
*10:20.740- 10:24.060* :  Katrina Perry has been to Michigan to take the electoral temperature.
*10:26.320- 10:31.580* :  The city of Dearborn is home to the biggest Arab-American and Muslim-American populations
*10:31.580- 10:38.000* :  in the U.S. The economy, cost of living, immigration, all issues concerning voters
*10:38.000- 10:42.060* :  here, but the Middle East crisis is top of the list.
*10:43.300- 10:48.240* :  Concerned for family and friends in Gaza has spread to worries about those in Lebanon
*10:48.840- 10:53.020* :  as exploding devices killed dozens and injured thousands this week.
*10:54.100- 11:03.640* :  It's heartbreaking just knowing that our tax money and our hard work is helping fund this.
*11:04.320- 11:09.600* :  These business owners, longtime Democrats, feel abandoned by the Biden-Harris administration
*11:09.620- 11:12.080* :  in its continued support for Israel.
*11:12.400- 11:16.240* :  You have somebody that's claiming to be a Democrat, somebody that's claiming to be a Republican,
*11:16.800- 11:22.000* :  and they're parroting the exact same platforms who can cause more damage, who can cause more
*11:22.220- 11:22.560* :  destruction.
*11:23.080- 11:28.140* :  The thought of voting for someone who's directly contributing, right now, directly contributing
*11:28.140- 11:34.800* :  to the death and destruction of our home country and of our relatives overseas.
*11:35.440- 11:40.680* :  I've made a decision to vote for Jill Stein, and I know that there are people who will
*11:40.680- 11:42.660* :  say, you know, it's a wasted vote.
*11:43.840- 11:46.660* :  Sam Hamud is the owner of the Sahara Cafe.
*11:47.680- 11:48.880* :  We asked for a ceasefire.
*11:49.860- 11:51.280* :  We never received a ceasefire.
*11:52.100- 11:56.060* :  I mean, no, I don't, we're running out of words.
*11:56.300- 12:00.340* :  As a local employer, he says inflation is crippling him.
*12:00.800- 12:01.860* :  I use a lot of flour.
*12:01.860- 12:03.380* :  I bake my own bread here.
*12:03.980- 12:09.700* :  For example, in 21, September 21, I brought down the power of 40 pound bags of flowers.
*12:10.360- 12:12.320* :  It cost me 1378 a bag.
*12:12.940- 12:15.580* :  Today, it's costing me 2192 a bag.
*12:16.160- 12:17.200* :  I always bring this going here.
*12:17.620- 12:20.860* :  Kaisal Tsawafi runs an auto parts manufacturing business.
*12:21.340- 12:24.840* :  He's created 1,000 jobs in the last 25 years.
*12:25.260- 12:32.660* :  Each party has pros and cons, and some day carry positive stuff and some negative stuff.
*12:32.720- 12:36.680* :  So we are still undecided which way to go.
*12:37.020- 12:41.060* :  It's a clearer choice for Dr. Bilal Nasir.
*12:41.580- 12:43.820* :  Trump, he's offered to stop the war song.
*12:45.020- 12:50.860* :  During his four years of presidency, we haven't experienced any wars.
*12:52.100- 12:55.260* :  And the economy was booming, actually.
*12:56.140- 12:59.840* :  In 2020, Joe Biden won Michigan by 2.78 percent.
*12:59.840- 13:04.260* :  In 2016, Donald Trump won by just 0.23 percent.
*13:04.780- 13:07.440* :  And the campaigns know it's going to be tight again this year.
*13:07.440- 13:09.880* :  They're peppering the state with multiple visits.
*13:10.380- 13:15.600* :  In the last week alone, Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, JD Vance and Tim Walls have all made
*13:15.600- 13:16.680* :  trips to Michigan.
*13:17.440- 13:23.460* :  Cybersecurity experts told BBC News that Russia, China and Iran all have plans to disrupt
*13:23.460- 13:24.940* :  the US presidential election.
*13:25.100- 13:31.280* :  The Microsoft Threat Analysis Center says efforts by Kremlin-aligned groups have been derailed
*13:31.280- 13:33.820* :  by the Democrats' recent change in candidate.
*13:34.420- 13:38.200* :  Our artificial intelligence correspondent Mark Chislak reports from New York.
*13:39.200- 13:42.640* :  Sea of calm away from the tourists and traffic.
*13:42.740- 13:47.160* :  This is where we find M-TAC, the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center.
*13:48.180- 13:52.440* :  Let's take a look now at an actor of a former employees of the Russian Ministry of Defense.
*13:53.060- 13:58.360* :  Here, specialist analysts, many with military intelligence backgrounds, detect and disrupt
*13:58.360- 14:01.700* :  cyber-enabled influence threats to democracies worldwide.
*14:02.380- 14:07.400* :  Reports say compile advise governments like the UK and US about these risks.
*14:08.100- 14:12.140* :  Individuals from this organization serve on a special presidential committee.
*14:12.140- 14:17.560* :  Former FBI Special Agent and now head of M-TAC Clint Watts tells me Russian-aligned plans
*14:17.560- 14:23.100* :  to interfere with the US election have been thrown into disarray by Kamala Harris' run
*14:23.100- 14:23.760* :  for president.
*14:23.960- 14:30.180* :  The biggest impact of the switch of Biden for Vice President Harris has been it's really
*14:30.180- 14:32.420* :  thrown the Russians so far off their game.
*14:32.500- 14:35.140* :  They had focused everything really on President Biden.
*14:35.500- 14:40.760* :  Had going back to 2018-19, they had really focused on Biden as somebody they needed to remove
*14:40.760- 14:42.480* :  from office to get what they wanted in Ukraine.
*14:43.020- 14:46.000* :  Today, that has changed almost entirely.
*14:46.360- 14:50.600* :  Watts goes on to tell me Russian groups aren't the only ones engaging in this kind of activity.
*14:51.120- 14:56.800* :  Iran has just entered the fold in recent months using both cyber-attacks and influence operations
*14:56.880- 14:58.220* :  to try and cause chaos.
*14:58.480- 15:01.700* :  Then China, in previous cycles, we saw almost nothing from China.
*15:01.700- 15:06.820* :  But in this case, we do see them establishing social media accounts and websites, which
*15:06.820- 15:10.040* :  they used to provoke some sort of conversations with American voters.
*15:10.040- 15:13.300* :  And this is the first cycle where we've had all three that we can definitely point to.
*15:13.800- 15:16.500* :  Santa Sikari is an M-TAC threat analyst.
*15:16.660- 15:22.160* :  She tells me that AI is being used in influence campaigns, but in a much more mundane way
*15:22.620- 15:24.100* :  than many might expect.
*15:24.700- 15:29.560* :  We found that in the source code for these websites, they were doing was using AI to rewrite
*15:29.560- 15:33.020* :  content from a real place and using that for the bulk of their website.
*15:33.620- 15:38.720* :  And then occasionally, they would write real articles when it was a very specific political
*15:38.720- 15:39.020* :  point.
*15:40.480- 15:45.900* :  The U.S. Department of Justice has separately accused Russia and Iran of election interference.
*15:46.360- 15:52.140* :  Recently seizing 32 websites, it says, used AI to try and spread Russian disinformation.
*15:52.300- 15:58.760* :  With seven weeks to go, cybersecurity companies and intelligence agencies remain on high alert
*15:58.760- 16:03.480* :  to online attempts to interfere with an election that has global consequences.
*16:04.180- 16:07.080* :  And it's not just election officials that are worried about AI.
*16:07.080- 16:12.180* :  The United Nations has published a report condemning the current governance of artificial
*16:12.180- 16:17.740* :  intelligence as a patchwork of guidelines dominated by just a handful of wealthy countries.
*16:17.860- 16:23.120* :  The UN's report commissioned by the General Secretary Antonio Guterresche urged states
*16:23.120- 16:28.620* :  to create an international committee that includes developing nations in AI governance.
*16:29.280- 16:31.340* :  Here's our technology editor, Zoe Kleinman.
*16:31.900- 16:36.940* :  If I had a pound for every treaty code guidelines, set of principles and so on,
*16:36.940- 16:39.820* :  that I've read about AI safety in the last couple of years.
*16:39.840- 16:44.360* :  I think I'd be talking to you for my intropical island right now, because there's been so many
*16:44.360- 16:44.920* :  of them.
*16:45.160- 16:49.000* :  But the whole time there's also been voices saying, we don't need all of this.
*16:49.000- 16:53.760* :  What we need is a UN level oversight, you know, just like we have on climate change.
*16:53.940- 16:58.640* :  And now that's exactly what this report, which has been commissioned by the UN itself,
*16:58.640- 17:05.040* :  is recommending along with a global AI fund to enable more countries to access AI tools
*17:05.040- 17:05.700* :  and training.
*17:05.880- 17:09.580* :  What's really interesting to note, I think, is the spread of power, if you like, among
*17:09.580- 17:14.420* :  all of these conversations, because they are very much centered around rich Western countries.
*17:14.860- 17:19.300* :  The report authors looked at a sample of those biggest treaties and declarations that
*17:19.300- 17:19.960* :  we've had lately.
*17:19.960- 17:23.660* :  And it found that only seven countries have signed up to all of them.
*17:23.980- 17:28.040* :  And they include the UK and the US and Canada and France.
*17:28.060- 17:33.320* :  And there were 118 UN member states that haven't signed up to any of them at all.
*17:33.700- 17:36.060* :  And guess what, they're all largely based in the global south.
*17:36.060- 17:40.420* :  So we've got a really uneven distribution here of where even the conversations about
*17:40.420- 17:42.260* :  AI safety and control are having.
*17:42.260- 17:46.580* :  And on the other hand, we've got this enormously powerful and rapidly evolving technology
*17:46.980- 17:51.580* :  that's coming out as very fast and is threatening to disrupt lots of people's lives all over
*17:51.580- 17:51.980* :  the world.
*17:52.600- 17:53.740* :  So we climb and reporting.
*17:56.580- 18:08.680* :  Later, the importance of the seabed in preventing climate change.
*18:15.760- 18:16.500* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*18:16.500- 18:21.220* :  Recently, I asked Mint Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise
*18:21.220- 18:22.560* :  prices due to inflation.
*18:22.560- 18:23.600* :  They said, yes.
*18:24.020- 18:27.980* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those onerous to your contracts,
*18:27.980- 18:30.340* :  they said, what the f**k are you talking about?
*18:30.340- 18:31.940* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*18:32.220- 18:37.540* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*18:37.560- 18:40.120* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.

*19:23.880- 19:29.380* :  The BBC has revealed that the late Mohammed Alphired former owner of the famous London department
*19:29.380- 19:34.360* :  store Harrods has been accused of rape by five female ex-employees.
*19:34.720- 19:41.080* :  Mr Alphired, an Egyptian-born businessman, rose from a poor family in Alexandria to buying
*19:41.080- 19:43.320* :  the world famous shop in 1985.
*19:44.040- 19:48.760* :  A BBC documentary has uncovered evidence that under Mohammed Alphired's ownership,
*19:48.780- 19:53.940* :  Harrods not only failed to intervene, but helped cover up abuse allegations.
*19:54.060- 19:58.380* :  This report from Shimer Khalil contains description of sexual violence.
*20:01.560- 20:04.320* :  I went back to Harrods about a year ago.
*20:06.540- 20:12.200* :  I knew if I could walk through and come out the other side, I'd be in a good place to be talking to you.
*20:13.780- 20:18.840* :  I joined Harrods because I wanted to be a buyer and I ended up working for an
*20:18.840- 20:20.100* :  absolute monster.
*20:21.320- 20:24.800* :  When Mohammed Alphired took over Harrods, the world famous department store,
*20:25.320- 20:29.460* :  he quickly embraced his high profile role and the status that came with it.
*20:32.500- 20:35.540* :  To his customers on the celebrity guests, he was all charm.
*20:35.580- 20:40.420* :  But to many of his female employees, he was a different man, a predator.
*20:41.480- 20:45.620* :  We've heard testimony from more than 20 of Alphired's female ex-employees.
*20:46.460- 20:53.760* :  He tried to rate me more than once and he pushed me in and onto the bed so that I couldn't move.
*20:54.400- 20:58.560* :  You know, he was 79 nearly 80 and I was 15.
*20:59.740- 21:01.480* :  Mohammed Alphired was rich and powerful.
*21:01.500- 21:05.960* :  That power allowed him to carry out assault at scale over decades.
*21:06.480- 21:09.220* :  Rising France and he'd come upstairs into my room.
*21:10.620- 21:11.980* :  I was absolutely terrified.
*21:12.860- 21:17.080* :  Sophia worked as his personal assistant for three years, starting in 1988.
*21:18.200- 21:24.000* :  Got into bed with me, he was trying to kiss me and push himself on me and again,
*21:24.040- 21:28.040* :  I just, I don't know how I did it. I just kicked him off. I kicked him,
*21:28.040- 21:33.620* :  kicked him, kicked him, kicked him, screamed and again, I got him off. I was just just terrified.
*21:33.820- 21:39.920* :  We also spoke to Jumma, who worked as Alphired's personal assistant for two years in the late 2000s.
*21:40.200- 21:43.440* :  I think Mohammed Alphired is rapist. I think it's a serial rapist.
*21:45.320- 21:52.520* :  I joined in 2007 and it was my first job in London. His behaviour with become more scary while I was
*21:52.580- 21:59.720* :  on the trips. My first trip was actually to Abu Dhabi and he was trying to get in my room in quite
*21:59.720- 22:03.260* :  an aggressive manner. It was absolutely terrifying. I just didn't know which way to turn.
*22:03.260- 22:08.920* :  So I brought a small dick to phone that I had in my pocket and these are the transcripts from
*22:08.920- 22:14.200* :  those recordings. One of them was in Paris in his residence there, Villa Windsor.
*22:16.800- 22:22.400* :  I said, I just want to go to sleep on my own, mystified, I don't want to, mystified and he kept
*22:22.400- 22:29.360* :  saying, relax, please relax. How can you relax when you're in that situation? He walked out and he
*22:29.360- 22:35.240* :  was angry. Not long after this incident, Jumma says Alphired raped her.
*22:36.300- 22:41.080* :  The BBC has her testimony from four other women who say he raped them at his properties.
*22:42.300- 22:47.340* :  In 2009, Jumma contacted a lawyer who told Herds she was leaving her job on the grounds of
*22:47.340- 22:51.980* :  sexual harassment. She didn't feel able to disclose the more serious allegations at the time.
*22:53.100- 22:58.180* :  They agreed to pay a settlement if she signed a non-disclosure agreement. There was also one
*22:58.180- 23:04.140* :  other condition. The lawyer is organized for a shredding truck to come to my lawyer's office.
*23:05.400- 23:09.980* :  Where we placed everything in, it was shredded in front of us, including tapes I had of him.
*23:10.220- 23:14.680* :  My phone had messages and voicemails, really quite nasty voicemails on them.
*23:15.260- 23:19.280* :  Someone from HR was present for the shredding of all of the evidence I had.
*23:21.320- 23:27.800* :  I thought I'd lost the transcripts, but actually what I did have was the transcriptions sent to my lawyer
*23:28.360- 23:31.640* :  in my scent items of my email account at the time.
*23:33.220- 23:37.400* :  In a statement, the current owners of Herds say they were utterly appalled by the allegations,
*23:37.500- 23:42.680* :  and that employees who were his victims had been failed, for which they sincerely apologized.
*23:43.660- 23:48.200* :  They also said that the Herds of Today is a very different organization to the one owned and
*23:48.200- 23:55.360* :  controlled by Alphired, between 1985 and 2010. There were several attempts to expose Alphired
*23:55.360- 24:00.960* :  before his death, but it is only now that many of the survivors feel able to speak publicly about
*24:00.960- 24:06.080* :  the abuse for those who have, the silence and the taboo are finally broken.
*24:06.680- 24:11.200* :  For more on this, the new season of World of Secrets from the BBC World Service is available
*24:11.200- 24:17.120* :  right now, wherever you get your BBC podcasts, and the documentary Alphired Predator at Herds
*24:17.380- 24:23.720* :  is coming soon on the BBC News Channel on TV, and if you're in the United States or Canada on BBC
*24:23.720- 24:29.380* :  Select. A man has been arrested in Sublisi on suspicion of murdering the most prominent transgender
*24:29.380- 24:36.700* :  woman in Georgia. The 26-year-old is accused of stabbing Kazaria Abra Micei to death in her home
*24:36.700- 24:42.800* :  on Wednesday. Rayhanda Mietri is in Sublisi. The model and actor had more than half a million
*24:42.800- 24:49.340* :  followers on Instagram, and her openness about identity was considered an act of bravery in the country,
*24:49.340- 24:54.080* :  which has seen a number of violent homophobic rides organized by far-right groups.
*24:54.440- 25:00.140* :  Her murder took place a day after Georgia's parliament passed a new law on family values and
*25:00.140- 25:06.840* :  the protection of minors. It imposes further restrictions on LGBTQ rights, including a continuing
*25:06.840- 25:10.740* :  ban on same-sex marriages and gender-affirming medical treatment.
*25:11.400- 25:16.720* :  For more on the legislation from the governing Georgian Dream Party that curbs LGBT rights,
*25:16.720- 25:23.360* :  my colleague Emilio Cricio has been speaking to Tamar Dakeli, a queer activist and the founder of
*25:23.360- 25:29.000* :  the Tablisi Pride Group. When the Georgian Dream, the ruling party announced the bill, it was
*25:29.520- 25:35.160* :  very clear that they wanted to basically use this bill in order to animate their conservative
*25:35.160- 25:41.560* :  electorate in order to appeal to the people who live in the regions of Georgia who are very
*25:42.340- 25:47.980* :  traditional and who are nostalgic about the way that life was back in the Soviet Union.
*25:48.300- 25:55.660* :  But of course, on a personal level, I am devastated and disappointed that this is actually what
*25:55.660- 26:01.820* :  Georgia has come to. When several years ago we were progressing towards having more advanced
*26:01.820- 26:08.440* :  rights towards greater equality and freedom. Now we are regressing at an alarming rate.
*26:08.820- 26:13.920* :  In recent months, Georgia was in the headlines as the government looked to pass an anti-foreign
*26:13.920- 26:19.480* :  agent's bill. That sparked mass demonstrations. In your opinion, is there a connection between
*26:19.480- 26:25.920* :  that bill and this anti-LGBT propaganda bill? Yes, there is definitely a connection between the foreign
*26:25.920- 26:34.300* :  agent bill and the anti-LGBT bill. Both of them are designed to to censor and to make life
*26:34.300- 26:39.620* :  difficult basically for the people who are progressive, for the people who are fighting for democracy
*26:39.620- 26:46.860* :  here. On the one hand, we have this foreign agent bill that targets civil society, including us
*26:46.860- 26:53.640* :  as Felicity Pride because we have been one of the primary targets of this bill, but also the rest
*26:53.640- 27:00.340* :  of the civil society organizations that are monitoring the elections, organizations that are giving
*27:00.340- 27:06.120* :  out services that are working on women's rights and so on. On the other hand, we have this
*27:07.240- 27:14.420* :  anti-LGBT bill which basically this bill gives the government authority to disperse any rally,
*27:14.420- 27:22.540* :  any demonstration which features an openly LGBT person or like which features something
*27:22.540- 27:29.120* :  about same-sex couples. So this bill is also about censorship and it's going to censor books and
*27:29.120- 27:38.700* :  movies and theater plays and you have to cut out scenes featuring LGBT people from movies or
*27:38.720- 27:44.840* :  from books or from theater plays and this really feels like authoritarian, this really feels like
*27:45.780- 27:52.560* :  Soviet Union all over again. And the Tbilisi Pride group is a really significant group when it
*27:52.560- 27:57.740* :  comes to queer activism not only in Georgia but in the wider region in the South Caucasus.
*27:57.900- 28:02.600* :  What could this bill mean for the activities of your group of the Tbilisi Pride group?
*28:03.120- 28:09.340* :  Our activities are going to be totally thinned I would say. We have already been unable to hold
*28:09.340- 28:16.920* :  activities like this summer in summer of 2024 we were unable to hold pride events. I would say
*28:16.920- 28:23.540* :  everybody is feeling really panicked even more so than me. I'm just that kind of person but
*28:24.040- 28:29.460* :  most people around me are actually very stressed out and anxious and panicked and a lot of
*28:29.460- 28:35.400* :  people have already been packing their stuff and emigrating a broad, especially queer people.
*28:36.240- 28:43.580* :  We have had a lot of farewell parties recently of queer people who are also very visible,
*28:43.580- 28:50.260* :  who are not really feeling safe to stay but if the community really leaves then what are these
*28:50.260- 28:57.380* :  changes even for like who are we going to celebrate the victory with if the community leaves.
*28:58.160- 29:02.360* :  That was Tamarja Kelly, a queer activist and the founder of the Tbilisi Pride group.
*29:03.480- 29:09.020* :  The International Energy Agency has warned that Ukraine faces its most challenging winter yet
*29:09.020- 29:14.640* :  when it comes to ensuring energy supplies. Intense Russian attacks have severely depleted
*29:14.640- 29:19.460* :  its generating capacity and grid. Is our Europe regional editor Danny Overhard?
*29:19.960- 29:25.240* :  In a report the IEA said Ukraine could see electricity shortfalls of a third of peak
*29:25.240- 29:30.520* :  demands this winter. Russian attacks of unprecedented scale earlier this year it said
*29:30.520- 29:36.440* :  meant Ukraine could only generate about a third of the electricity it could pre-war even before
*29:36.440- 29:41.120* :  the latest strikes. The IEA is recommending ten steps to help Ukraine,
*29:41.120- 29:46.260* :  bolstering air defenses being the most important but also speeding up deliveries of equipment
*29:46.260- 29:51.240* :  and spares and improving ways of supplying it with gas and electricity from the EU.
*29:51.920- 29:55.320* :  The agency is also warning of the threat to Moldovan energy supplies.
*29:56.220- 30:00.300* :  There's currently a renewed momentum for a diplomatic solution to the war in Sudan.
*30:00.300- 30:05.880* :  The conflict broke out last year between the regular army and the paramilitary rapid support
*30:05.880- 30:11.300* :  forces. Millions have been driven from their homes and famine has been declared in some areas.
*30:11.900- 30:15.100* :  Earlier this week the U.S. President Joe Biden called for the warring
*30:15.100- 30:20.100* :  sides to engage in talks. The BBC's former Sudan correspondent James Cotnell asked
*30:20.100- 30:25.480* :  the U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan Tom Perry-Ello about the timing of this diplomatic push.
*30:26.200- 30:31.200* :  Well we're talking about a situation that's in some ways unprecedented in recent history.
*30:31.200- 30:36.320* :  We've got a million people facing starvation but 20 million facing acute hunger.
*30:36.780- 30:42.720* :  We're determined a situation where sexual slavery is being used as a weapon of war along with
*30:42.720- 30:48.380* :  starvation and we've been trying to get talks going for many, many months and President Biden said,
*30:48.380- 30:53.340* :  look we got to go forward with these talks in August. We gathered a group of diplomatic partners.
*30:53.340- 31:00.200* :  We started to get access routes open. We're moving food by the tons, by the millions of pounds
*31:00.200- 31:05.900* :  but it's not even nearly enough relative to the scale of the crisis and I think President Biden wanted
*31:05.900- 31:10.920* :  to continue to escalate that pressure. One of the main focuses of the fighting right now,
*31:10.920- 31:16.720* :  of course there are many across the country, is Elfasha in the Western Darfur region, North Darfur
*31:16.720- 31:24.540* :  with the RSF besieging it. Is it your sense that it is now a critical moment in terms of trying
*31:24.540- 31:30.400* :  to save in particular civilian lives there as the RSF closes in on the city? It's a horrific
*31:30.400- 31:36.460* :  situation and we certainly need to think about hundreds of thousands of civilians who are stuck in
*31:36.460- 31:43.540* :  the city or have managed to escape as far as the SAMSAM camp but still are facing a desperate need
*31:43.540- 31:49.480* :  for food and medicine. We've been trying to get in emergency convoys but we have to end this
*31:49.480- 31:55.420* :  fighting. We need the RSF to pull back from the siege and the joint forces and the army to
*31:55.420- 32:00.820* :  agree to that ceasefire and that's just for Elfasha. We're talking about a country of 50 million
*32:00.820- 32:08.100* :  people across a tremendous diversity of ethnic groups all facing this crisis with so little attention
*32:08.100- 32:13.140* :  from the international community so we really appreciate that President Biden and Secretary Blinken
*32:13.140- 32:18.420* :  have focused that our partners including the Egyptians are trying to figure out a way to end
*32:18.420- 32:25.020* :  this horrific crisis. One thing we hear a lot from Sudanese's frustration at the International
*32:25.020- 32:32.840* :  Community perhaps America above all treating both of the main-waring parties the same. As soon as
*32:32.840- 32:38.220* :  armed forces in the RSF on the one hand they did this on the other they did this. Do you perceive
*32:38.220- 32:45.500* :  them as equal or do you see as many Sudanese for example say that the RSF is committing the
*32:45.500- 32:50.340* :  majority of the crimes against civilians that more civilians are suffering at the RSF's hands
*32:50.420- 32:57.320* :  than at the hands of others? We don't see them as equal we see in our sanctions show this greater
*32:57.320- 33:03.780* :  level of atrocities in the RSF but we also hold the army to a higher standard because it wants to
*33:03.780- 33:09.200* :  be seen as the legitimate army and the sovereign power and therefore when it does things like shut
*33:09.200- 33:15.500* :  down the border to food and medicine to reach the most vulnerable we do expect more of them and so
*33:15.500- 33:21.700* :  I think right now we don't see two equal sides we two see two different sides but we also remember
*33:21.700- 33:28.020* :  this crisis was created because the two sides that are fighting now joined forces to overthrow
*33:28.720- 33:33.920* :  the civilian democratic transition that the Sudanese people dreamed of. Finally in this podcast
*33:41.620- 33:47.080* :  well it might be mud to flanders and swan but to some conservationists it's blue carbon
*33:47.080- 33:53.180* :  the sediment and silt on the seabed that holds huge quantities of organic carbon and the worry
*33:53.180- 33:58.900* :  is that by disturbing it for example by building wind farms it might release carbon into the
*33:58.900- 34:04.920* :  atmosphere boosting global warming. Ruth Williams is the head of marine conservation at the wildlife
*34:04.920- 34:11.480* :  trust here in Britain. It's kind of the unsung hero of our seas unfortunately the seabed sediments
*34:11.480- 34:16.840* :  in particular but other blue carbon habitats our salt marshes and our seagrass are at risk of
*34:16.840- 34:22.340* :  disturbance and particularly the muds they're disturbed by bottom-trawed gear fishing gear that
*34:22.340- 34:27.840* :  really destroys the top surfaces of those muds and offshore development where cables are laid
*34:27.840- 34:32.660* :  across moorings are inputted to that sediment and it's really awareness of that disturbance
*34:32.660- 34:36.580* :  that we want to raise. So in other words if you're going to put up a wind farm which clearly is
*34:37.080- 34:41.140* :  being done in part because of dealing with climate change all those cables that are kind of come
*34:41.140- 34:46.200* :  from the wind farm onto our shores what could you do then to protect the mud that's disturbed as a
*34:46.200- 34:51.320* :  result. What we're calling for is a whole system approach. This report recognizes the importance
*34:51.320- 34:56.920* :  of blue carbon what we now need to see is better strategic planning of activities at sea and to use
*34:56.920- 35:01.800* :  the network of marine protected areas on nature reserves at sea much more effectively to protect
*35:01.800- 35:07.520* :  not just the biodiversity the wildlife that lives in these areas but also this blue carbon this
*35:07.520- 35:13.380* :  incredible valuable resource as well so we want to mandate all activities under that impact
*35:13.380- 35:18.240* :  assessment system because these damaging activities are still allow in these areas which is wrong
*35:18.240- 35:23.180* :  at the moment and we need to protect and move forward and provide that wind wind for both nature
*35:23.180- 35:27.260* :  and our climate targets. Ruth Willib speaking there to Nick Robinson
