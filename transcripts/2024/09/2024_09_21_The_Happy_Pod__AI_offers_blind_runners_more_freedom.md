*01:20.240- 01:23.680* :  Hi, this is Fatmer in Malmo and you're listening to The Happy Pod.
*01:28.820- 01:30.680* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition.
*01:31.140- 01:37.220* :  I felt just one of all of those 18,000 persons, you know, my disability was not an issue anymore.
*01:37.580- 01:42.960* :  Celebrating the new technology that enabled a visually impaired runner in Sweden to complete a half
*01:42.960- 01:47.260* :  marathon. The train bringing affordable healthcare to communities across South
*01:47.260- 01:52.920* :  Africa, we meet a man returning to Morocco to thank the villagers who saved him after he was
*01:53.000- 01:54.100* :  crushed by a boulder.
*01:54.340- 01:55.480* :  I wouldn't be here without them.
*01:55.840- 01:59.420* :  It's a very selfless act for them to do that in a time of need.
*02:00.060- 02:03.240* :  We'll hear about Penn Chan, the escaped penguin who survived,
*02:03.240- 02:07.760* :  thanks to a typhoon and the couple with a rather unusual job share.
*02:08.120- 02:13.000* :  I'm Chauvin Berman and I'm Matthias Luttenberg and you're listening to The Happy Pod
*02:13.000- 02:14.580* :  from the BBC World Service.
*02:20.020- 02:25.120* :  We start with an invention that it's hoped could bring a new sense of freedom and independence
*02:25.120- 02:30.980* :  to millions of people with visual impairment. It was given a test run literally on a half marathon
*02:30.980- 02:35.220* :  in Sweden and it's probably best if you're listening to this on headphones.
*02:36.140- 02:48.300* :  The new system, tested by the former Paralympian Fatmir Cerametti, uses the camera of a smartphone
*02:48.300- 02:54.340* :  attached to his chest and sends signals to his headphones telling him there if he's too close
*02:54.660- 02:56.740* :  to someone or if he needs to go left.
*03:03.340- 03:08.220* :  Or indeed right. It's hoped the technology can be improved to allow people with
*03:08.220- 03:11.780* :  sight problems to do a wide range of activities independently.
*03:11.860- 03:18.220* :  Before the event Fatmir, whose vision has been fading since he was 13, was excited about the
*03:18.220- 03:23.200* :  freedom of running by himself. So my colleague Andrew Peach asked him, how did it go?
*03:23.680- 03:31.480* :  It felt great, a sense of freedom, a sense of self-development that everything is actually
*03:31.480- 03:38.680* :  possible to do. So it was a different experience but really, really nice.
*03:39.060- 03:44.860* :  So a lot of people will have seen athletes being supported by someone running with them.
*03:45.520- 03:47.160* :  What did you want to do it on your own?
*03:47.540- 03:51.480* :  Until I got 13 years old, I could see full. I was fully sighted.
*03:51.820- 03:59.620* :  And I got this eye sickness called glaucoma that took away about 80% of my sight through two years
*04:00.220- 04:06.220* :  and after that it slowly decreased. So now I can just see the difference between light and darkness
*04:06.880- 04:14.180* :  and getting through those years, being afraid of losing your sense of freedom and
*04:14.660- 04:22.600* :  being able to do stuff by your own is a huge feeling to bear. So when this opportunity came
*04:22.600- 04:30.780* :  from Google for me to be part of this project and try to do this was of course an offer I could
*04:30.780- 04:38.240* :  not say no to. Running is supposed to be one of the easiest sports outdoors things to do.
*04:38.280- 04:43.760* :  You just put on your shoes and go out and run if you're fully sighted and that's my goal.
*04:43.760- 04:50.360* :  That's my wish to also be able to do that in the future. Just go out and run whatever I feel
*04:50.880- 04:58.580* :  doing it without having anyone. I'm really excited about what this kind of technology will bring
*04:58.580- 05:04.480* :  to us as disabled people in the future. I mean some people I suppose might be fearful to
*05:04.940- 05:11.180* :  go running without someone there at their side because I guess you can't be quite as certain
*05:11.900- 05:17.280* :  that there's nothing there is a danger or nothing in the way or anything of that sort.
*05:17.600- 05:23.680* :  Well you know I've been an athlete basically all my life. I've had the honors of being part of
*05:23.680- 05:31.380* :  three Paralympics in a sport called Goal Ball. So I'm used to you know tough training and a bit
*05:31.380- 05:39.500* :  rough. So for me I was not afraid and I actually just after a couple of trials with these
*05:39.500- 05:45.500* :  device I felt like I can trust the system. Could you use it the whole time? Do you think the AI
*05:45.500- 05:51.160* :  could get clever enough to be able to guide you through life as a blind person as well as when
*05:51.160- 05:58.360* :  you're in a more controlled environment? Well I am prepared to go so far as to say that AI will
*05:58.360- 06:06.300* :  be a game changer when it comes to accessibility for people who visually impairment. I'm sure that
*06:06.340- 06:13.340* :  this is just a small step of what's waiting ahead. Imagine you could use this kind of programming
*06:13.380- 06:21.400* :  in every situation in life even like going skiing or just going to the store to buy products.
*06:21.400- 06:25.840* :  I'm really hopeful and I think that this is this is the future.
*06:26.260- 06:30.340* :  I get the freedom thing. One of my closest friends is a disabled yachtswoman and the important
*06:30.340- 06:36.420* :  thing about going sailing for her is to find technology that means she can do it on her own
*06:36.820- 06:41.020* :  even though she can't use her arms and legs but the freedom that you then have which you're
*06:41.020- 06:47.300* :  denied in many areas of life as a disabled person must be incredible. Well imagine you know
*06:48.080- 06:56.340* :  the feeling that I had for the first time for for being blind so many years now to run to the
*06:56.340- 07:01.880* :  finish line and know that it's a hundred meters straight ahead and now I can just do it
*07:02.080- 07:08.800* :  completely on my own just being able to to run through that finish line and then just hug my
*07:08.800- 07:15.200* :  teammates it was like I felt just you know that's one of all of those 18,000 persons you know my
*07:15.200- 07:20.740* :  disability was not an issue anymore and that is the the main thing for me in this project it was
*07:20.980- 07:27.080* :  the feeling about you know being able to accomplish something like this completely on my own was
*07:27.080- 07:33.480* :  huge. Admir Selimetti was talking to Andrew Pete to South Africa now and a solution to bring
*07:33.480- 07:38.760* :  decent affordable health care to people who otherwise wouldn't have access to it.
*07:39.240- 07:43.400* :  Two trains travel around the country complete with clinics and a pharmacy.
*07:43.940- 07:49.180* :  The scheme has been growing since it began around 30 years ago and last year saw a staggering
*07:49.180- 07:56.800* :  640,000 patients. It's so popular that people often have to queue overnight but as umpola
*07:56.800- 08:02.240* :  kaja reports from Soweto a township of Johannesburg most think it's worth waiting for.
*08:04.320- 08:10.160* :  As I made my way into the station I saw a slick grey train 19 carriages long.
*08:10.820- 08:17.040* :  It's called the Transnepelopepa healthcare train. Pelopepa means good clean health.
*08:17.560- 08:23.820* :  Besides the train, a two rows of white plastic chairs and mostly older women are sitting
*08:23.820- 08:31.900* :  waiting patiently to be seen. One of them is Sulufelo Lucia who is waiting for a dental appointment.
*08:32.800- 08:38.720* :  I'm here to come and clean my teeth. I think it's one year I have a problem with my teeth
*08:39.280- 08:44.280* :  so I don't like the way I smile it's much cheaper than when I go to the dentist.
*08:45.320- 08:52.680* :  There are 22 permanent staff who work it and slip on the train. Nurses and other support workers
*08:52.680- 09:02.120* :  are employed locally. On the platform I saw an optician asking an elderly lady to read out letters.
*09:04.580- 09:09.760* :  Another optician, Komotsupalahangwe, told me they mostly treat older patients.
*09:10.080- 09:15.980* :  It is really a nice feeling to actually change somebody's world. We get patients that come
*09:15.980- 09:20.920* :  here and they didn't even know how bad their vision is. They realize that wow what I've been seeing
*09:20.920- 09:25.220* :  is actually not there and others are desperate to get spectacles because without government
*09:25.220- 09:29.900* :  institutions it takes longer for them to get the spectacles but then with us we provide them
*09:30.320- 09:32.400* :  with the services in the same day.
*09:33.640- 09:40.920* :  Crossing a lands cutting machine I got talking to Zongizile Makubu. Zongizile was prepared to wait
*09:40.920- 09:47.920* :  as he knew he'd get an eye test and new glasses for 30 rent that's less than two US dollars.
*09:48.700- 09:55.000* :  At a local clinic he would have paid 10 times as much. People do not have money, people are unemployed
*09:55.000- 10:01.640* :  so once an opportunity like this come people will come in large numbers. The service is way
*10:01.640- 10:07.700* :  better than the local clinics. I matched headed down the train to the dental clinic.
*10:08.640- 10:14.400* :  Whoa lots of children this side of the train. I think they are from the same school because
*10:14.400- 10:23.060* :  they are dressed in the same colors. Anyone under 16 get services on the train for free as I heard
*10:23.060- 10:29.500* :  from the lead dentist Dr Agnes Ramutla. So here we offer services that you find at a
*10:29.940- 10:34.880* :  maybe a local hospital. So that would be your cleanings and your feelings and
*10:34.880- 10:40.280* :  extractions. So most of our numbers we get them from actually schools. Obviously they are desperate
*10:40.280- 10:45.740* :  for this service. How important is this to you? I like helping communities it's like we are
*10:46.100- 10:50.880* :  there last hope. So with day we can even see more than 100 in a local hospital. I used to see
*10:50.880- 10:56.740* :  like 28 days and that was a lot for me. I see passion in your face. Yes I'm very passionate
*10:56.740- 11:01.900* :  about dentistry. I've always wanted to do this my whole life. So this is like a dream.
*11:02.780- 11:09.640* :  The train service really relies on medical students like Timberlite Dubé. Students work
*11:09.640- 11:15.940* :  on the train for a fortnight during their final year of studies. Usually at school you would
*11:15.940- 11:23.080* :  see two or three patients a day but here we go as far as seeing 120 patients on a daily basis
*11:23.080- 11:28.460* :  so it is extremely hectic but it's extremely helpful. A part of my passion during dentistry
*11:28.460- 11:33.620* :  was to help people and that's exactly what we are doing here. Bringing smiles you know when
*11:33.620- 11:38.680* :  people live they're like oh thank you very much I can smile now and I'm happier that's exactly
*11:38.680- 11:44.460* :  what our job is to do. That report was by Impola Kaja and you can hear more about the healthcare
*11:44.460- 11:50.860* :  trains on people fixing the world wherever you get your BBC podcasts. Now a bird is
*11:50.860- 11:56.300* :  escaping into the wild to go on an adventure sounds like the plot of the animated Madagascar
*11:56.300- 12:02.260* :  movies and very much up our street. Penchang the penguin ran away or rather swam away from
*12:02.260- 12:09.100* :  captivity in Japan in August. She wasn't expected to survive the ocean or wild weather and yet this
*12:09.100- 12:16.440* :  is after all the happy pod. Abiona Boyer reports. On a hot summer's day in August on the tiny island
*12:16.440- 12:22.500* :  of Himakajima of the coast of Tokyo penchang a six year old cape penguin was taking a leisurely
*12:22.500- 12:27.380* :  swim at the beach to avoid heatstroke that was until she spotted a hole in the net used to fence
*12:27.380- 12:32.480* :  of the penguins and decided to make a break for it by swimming off into the ocean's vast waters.
*12:32.860- 12:37.580* :  Pen was born and raised in captivity so she'd never had to hunt or fend for herself and her swimming
*12:37.580- 12:42.500* :  ability was not thought to be on a par with wild cape penguins. For two weeks the future
*12:42.500- 12:47.540* :  of bird evaded her keepers who were worriedly searching for her. No one ever expected her to
*12:47.540- 12:52.220* :  survive more than a week and all hope was thought to have been lost when sightings of pen ran dry
*12:52.400- 12:58.700* :  and typhoon shanshan for search efforts to come to a halt. But by a complete stroke of luck that
*12:58.700- 13:04.140* :  same typhoon would prove to be the key to penchang survival. The lack of boats and fishing nets in the
*13:04.140- 13:10.140* :  ocean meant that she could swim about safely. She'd actually travelled 45 kilometers away from home
*13:10.320- 13:15.480* :  even going all the way round the tip of the cheetah peninsula before being rescued and reunited
*13:15.480- 13:21.140* :  with her keepers from gettican painters. The chief keeper, Raya Sake Mai, said that although pen
*13:21.140- 13:25.760* :  had lost a little weight she had no injuries and she'd clearly managed to find sustenance while
*13:25.760- 13:30.860* :  on her travels as well as having had a chance to work on her swimming skills. Now he said she was in
*13:30.860- 13:36.740* :  good spirits and sleeping safely next to him. For now at least there will be no more escape attempts.
*13:43.480- 13:47.160* :  Still to come in this podcast. We're getting comments from people that have said, I've had a really
*13:47.160- 13:50.580* :  really hard way. I've just seen this video of Maddy and it's completely changed my life and I feel
*13:50.580- 13:56.200* :  so much better. The dog whose love of rubbish collectors has made her an online sensation.
*14:04.160- 14:09.620* :  Now to the story of a very grateful man. Kiran Saubura was trekking in the snowy
*14:09.620- 14:16.420* :  atlas mountains of Morocco in February last year when disaster struck. He was crushed by a falling
*14:16.420- 14:22.580* :  boulder which broke his pelvis and severely damaged his legs and there he lay on that mountain
*14:22.580- 14:29.840* :  side far from home. Certain he was going to die. Instead he was saved by strangers. A passing
*14:29.840- 14:35.820* :  Spanish walker gave him a sleeping bag and gloves then eight men arrived from a village many kilometers
*14:35.820- 14:41.380* :  away to carry him to safety. Kiran is now planning to return to Morocco to thank them
*14:41.380- 14:47.360* :  and to give them the money he has raised running two marathons. Yes two marathons after those
*14:47.360- 14:54.000* :  injuries in February last year. He spoke to the happy pods Holly Gibbs starting with the moment
*14:54.020- 15:02.740* :  of the accident. My friend all of a sudden screamed my name. I turned round a boulder which my friend
*15:02.740- 15:11.100* :  believes also over 200 kilos hit me in my head. I tumbled down 20 feet and once I got to the bottom
*15:11.100- 15:15.620* :  of the path noticed that the boulder was rolling down the path and about to roll on top of me which
*15:15.620- 15:23.560* :  it did and the pain was unbearable. After two minutes they managed to get it off. I laid back
*15:24.200- 15:30.300* :  soon as I literally laid my head back I lost my eyesight for 20 minutes. I had made peace with
*15:30.300- 15:37.660* :  the dying. I had basically sat there and thought about my family and the life I had lived and
*15:38.500- 15:45.160* :  I was genuinely happy with the life I had lived and something crazy happened at that point in time
*15:45.160- 15:50.420* :  where my eyesight started to come back. I was like well I think I'm going to survive this.
*15:51.120- 15:56.980* :  The eight villages tricked up and the rogues wrapped me in rogues and tied me in rope
*15:58.220- 16:01.600* :  and I remember the little old man there there wasn't enough rope so he took his belt off and
*16:02.080- 16:07.940* :  tied his belt around me as well and then they put me on the stretcher and literally ran me down the
*16:07.940- 16:13.520* :  mountain in like two hours. How do you even come back from that lying there thinking that you
*16:13.520- 16:17.800* :  were going to die and thinking about all the people that you you love and you're not going to get
*16:17.800- 16:24.340* :  to see again? How do you even begin to get back on track? I tell you one thing when I actually got back
*16:24.400- 16:29.240* :  it was probably the best week and a half two weeks I spent with my family ever. The good side of
*16:29.240- 16:35.040* :  humanity when moments like that where you've nearly died you start to see no matter what anyone's
*16:35.040- 16:40.860* :  got going on in their own life people they drop it and they come to see you and it just brought
*16:40.860- 16:45.440* :  everyone together and yeah it's a moment I never forget I've realised I had how many good people
*16:45.440- 16:51.500* :  I had around me. Talk to me about why you want to go back to Morocco and meet the people who saved you.
*16:52.460- 16:56.360* :  Purely down to the fact I wouldn't be here without them you know it's a very selfless act
*16:56.640- 17:01.160* :  for them to do that in a time of need and like I said about the the side of humanity that many
*17:01.160- 17:05.440* :  people would like to overlook and what we don't get to see right because you see so much negative
*17:05.440- 17:12.240* :  things being portrayed on social media even news outlets and it's nice to see and feel and have
*17:12.240- 17:18.600* :  the experience of what humanity really is and for them to do that for me I just want to go back
*17:18.600- 17:23.720* :  and say thank you I raise money you know running a few marathons for them you know if someone could
*17:23.720- 17:28.760* :  do that for me I'm sure I can do a few things that potentially really challenging for myself
*17:28.760- 17:34.600* :  and give back to them. We talk a lot about kindness on the happy board and it seems that this is the
*17:34.600- 17:39.700* :  eight people that saved you ultimately it's an act of huge kindness as it made you want to pay
*17:39.700- 17:44.160* :  it forward do you find yourself looking out for others a bit more now you've had those people
*17:44.160- 17:48.860* :  look out for you yeah my personal mission is just to create as much impact in this world before I
*17:48.860- 17:54.220* :  die I've got given a second chance in my eyes so for me I know that my place in this world from
*17:54.540- 17:59.280* :  this day forward is to create as much impact as possible and help people and finally what is your
*17:59.280- 18:06.660* :  message to those eight people who saved you on the mountain it's really hard because I'm actually
*18:06.660- 18:15.340* :  of a fool about that but my message would be thank you so much for their act of kindness and
*18:16.280- 18:23.000* :  just their selfless act of being able to get someone they don't know in a time of extreme need
*18:23.760- 18:29.940* :  of the mountain safe and back home to people that love him and also me getting back to the people
*18:29.940- 18:34.340* :  that I thought I wasn't going to get saved by too. Kiran Saubura was talking to Holly Gibbs.
*18:35.600- 18:41.100* :  Now to bell fast where one dog has been brightening up the lives of bin workers on their weekly
*18:41.100- 18:47.560* :  collection Maddie the one-year-old golden retriever waits patiently every Friday to be petted
*18:48.060- 18:54.940* :  and has also found online fame with videos of her being a friendly golden retriever attracting
*18:54.940- 19:00.800* :  millions of views our Northern Ireland communities correspondent Mark Simpson has been to meet her.
*19:07.220- 19:14.220* :  Mark and Nathan love Maddie and Maddie loves Mark and Nathan and Friday wouldn't be Friday
*19:14.900- 19:18.960* :  without a get-together. The build up the sea of Maddie is on the label so it is
*19:19.300- 19:22.560* :  waste for us every morning every Friday morning to come around to give us a door the door
*19:22.620- 19:25.640* :  tells you and get out you can hear the lawyer coming up the street and stuff and everyone ever
*19:25.640- 19:29.660* :  came on Nathan's been doing the wrong log on to me he says whenever I come up here on a Friday
*19:29.660- 19:33.440* :  there's a dog up here they have to pat the dog and I'll see a Christian waste force. Does she not
*19:33.440- 19:38.760* :  hold you up? We don't mean I can stay here all day I stay here at a five o'clock wouldn't bother me.
*19:39.180- 19:43.080* :  Are all dogs like Maddie? I'd like to say they are because I'm a very big dog person
*19:43.080- 19:49.440* :  but he is just one of a kind. Maddie belongs to the fittest family in East
*19:49.440- 19:56.780* :  Bellfast in and Ruth their son Josh and daughter Caitlin. We've seen that she likes the bin workers.
*19:57.180- 20:01.400* :  What about the posties? I absolutely loves everyone and anyone who comes to the garden should
*20:01.860- 20:08.940* :  meet them, come say hi. She loves me everyone. Maddie has another family too on social media,
*20:09.900- 20:16.880* :  national and international followers and it's all because of videos of the Friday bin collections
*20:17.060- 20:25.160* :  outside the house. Caitlin takes up the story. So she's now I just passed the milestone with 20,000
*20:25.160- 20:29.480* :  followers on Instagram there's a video with 10 million views one with what 6.7 million and
*20:29.480- 20:34.240* :  another one with 2.2 million and they are all featuring the bin then. So we try really hard to come
*20:34.240- 20:38.360* :  up with like different content, different ideas and different videos and think yeah this is going
*20:38.360- 20:42.860* :  to be great and it gets me about 20,000 which is still fantastic and then the video as soon as
*20:42.860- 20:49.340* :  a bin man appears it's like wow 10 million views. Why is this caught fire? Everyone loves the dog
*20:49.340- 20:53.820* :  video. Everyone knows that you know any any videos my mom's always sending me videos going
*20:53.820- 20:58.620* :  retrievers and I think that's the reason why we ended up getting a dog because she was her feed was
*20:58.620- 21:02.480* :  being filled with videos of golden retrievers but there's something different about just normal
*21:02.940- 21:08.060* :  everyday people interacting with the dog and I think it's so lovely to say what started off
*21:08.060- 21:12.800* :  as something that was really really innocent actually and just posting videos of our pets smiling
*21:12.860- 21:17.020* :  and being happy. Actually we're getting comments from people that have said I've had a really really
*21:17.020- 21:21.420* :  hard week and I've just seen this video with Maddie and it's completely changed my life and I
*21:21.420- 21:27.340* :  feel so much better. The comments from people in like South Korea, Brazil, France, all over the world
*21:27.340- 21:31.480* :  and thankfully there's a transit button on Instagram so we can actually tell what they're saying but
*21:31.920- 21:37.960* :  it's just blown up in a way that we never could have imagined. While we were filming
*21:37.960- 21:45.880* :  mild-mannered Maddie didn't bark she just sat there cool calm and like the bins collected.
*21:50.000- 21:54.500* :  Mark Simpson reporting. Now for a few other stories that we've spotted this week,
*21:54.500- 22:00.820* :  a sheriff's deputy has been praised for climbing between moving vehicles on a busy highway
*22:00.820- 22:07.320* :  in Michigan to help a driver who was having a medical emergency. Deputy Nicole Myron was able to stop
*22:07.320- 22:12.720* :  his truck and get him help. The Makeham County Sheriff said her quick thinking and selfless actions
*22:12.780- 22:19.000* :  ended safely what could have been a tragic situation. San Diego Zoo is celebrating the birth of
*22:19.000- 22:23.720* :  a Sumatran tiger cub. The species is critically endangered with just four to six hundred
*22:24.000- 22:28.960* :  thought to remain in native habitats. The cub was born last month and it's thought that the
*22:28.960- 22:33.560* :  mother Jillian won't bring it out of their den for a few more weeks to give them time to bond.
*22:34.180- 22:38.800* :  Zookeepers say they hope the cub will give visitors a greater understanding of what they call
*22:38.800- 22:46.600* :  this incredibly special species and after thousands of public votes Hawkes Bay Airport in New Zealand
*22:46.600- 22:52.320* :  has announced the name of its new fire truck. More than 1,500 suggestions have been submitted
*22:52.320- 22:58.880* :  from around the world including spraying mantis and trucky muck truck face of course but the winner
*22:58.880- 23:05.920* :  by a landslide was Judy Drench. Employers are often looking for new ways to make jobs more attractive
*23:05.920- 23:11.160* :  during covid. Many people acquire a taste for working from home and since then there have been
*23:11.160- 23:17.180* :  moves in some countries towards bringing in a four-day working week. But how would you feel about
*23:17.180- 23:22.940* :  sharing a job with your partner? Well that's exactly what two German diplomats have chosen to do.
*23:23.240- 23:28.960* :  Over the next four years Joven Bellman and Matthias Luttenberg will be sharing the position
*23:28.960- 23:35.460* :  of Germany's ambassador to Canada. They arrived in Ottawa in July and will take turns with the role
*23:35.920- 23:40.280* :  while the other focuses on caring for their three children. They've been talking to Isabella
*23:40.280- 23:46.300* :  Jewel starting with Joven who's the first to take the helm. Normally there is one ambassador to
*23:46.300- 23:53.220* :  every country. You present your letters of credence to the head of state and then you you're the one
*23:53.220- 23:59.460* :  at the helm of the embassy and your partner if you have one either has a separate job or often
*23:59.460- 24:04.780* :  partners it's very difficult for them to work abroad because of course if your job is tied to
*24:04.780- 24:11.360* :  your home country it's often a challenge. So in our case we both presented letters of credence to
*24:11.360- 24:16.840* :  the governor general here in Canada. We'll rotate and inform the Canadians who is in charge each time.
*24:17.200- 24:21.840* :  An ambassador is actually a wonderful job. Your job is to present your country for
*24:21.840- 24:27.080* :  the relations between the countries, between the people, open up opportunities. There's so
*24:27.080- 24:32.680* :  much wonderful things to do and great people to meet. Of course it's very time consuming. You often
*24:32.680- 24:38.620* :  have appointments the whole day, you travel, you have engagements in the evening and when you're
*24:38.620- 24:43.640* :  a family like us with three children you need to make sure that they get the attention they deserve
*24:43.640- 24:49.700* :  as well which is why we have decided to share this job. How are you both finding it so far? I
*24:49.700- 24:54.820* :  appreciate that you only arrived in Canada a couple of months ago but how's it been going?
*24:55.580- 25:00.660* :  It's not always easy when you're used to work in full time to be honest but of course for the kids
*25:00.660- 25:06.520* :  it's I think so far a very good experience. They always have a parent around to consult, to ask
*25:06.520- 25:11.400* :  especially when you're new in the country. There's so many new challenges, be it school or
*25:11.820- 25:16.300* :  private life, finding friends and you really need to have some support there from your parents. So
*25:16.300- 25:20.940* :  this is working well. I think my kids have to get used to my style of cooking. They're not used
*25:20.940- 25:26.680* :  to this but honestly I think it's working pretty well and then we are glad that we have that chance
*25:26.680- 25:32.780* :  and that the Canadian government agreed for us to have that model. It's a wonderful job and
*25:32.780- 25:39.460* :  Canadians are very welcoming, friendly, helpful people. I mean everybody has been just wonderful
*25:39.460- 25:45.060* :  here and the people we've met together as part of some of the meetings we've done together or as
*25:45.060- 25:51.080* :  part of meetings we've had in the residence really were very very gratifying and I think we will
*25:51.080- 25:55.800* :  have a wonderful time. Do you think to have been that this job-sharing model that you're doing
*25:55.800- 26:02.360* :  with your husband might enable more women in the future to rise the ranks in diplomacy which is
*26:02.360- 26:09.120* :  traditionally seen as a more male-dominated career path? Finding flexible models of work is
*26:09.120- 26:14.560* :  certainly part of the strategy we have at the foreign office and that the minister really is leading
*26:15.440- 26:22.380* :  to make it easier for women in the service to grow up in their careers and to get to a more
*26:22.380- 26:27.540* :  equal percentage between a men and women in leadership positions. There are many other elements
*26:27.540- 26:33.600* :  such as work from home, home office or part-time work when the children are small which my husband
*26:33.600- 26:38.940* :  actually has done at a certain point in his career. We've also both of us taken turns to stay at
*26:38.940- 26:44.640* :  home when the children were where in their first years so there are many many ways to make our work
*26:44.640- 26:50.200* :  more flexible. We want the best and the brightest and in order for them to find our service
*26:50.200- 26:56.160* :  attractive the service has to become more flexible. If you don't mind me asking how did the two of you
*26:56.160- 27:02.140* :  meet? You might not be surprised that we met in the diplomatic training academy which was in our
*27:02.140- 27:07.720* :  former capital bon at that time however we we didn't become a couple immediately but only a
*27:07.720- 27:12.460* :  a couple of years later after finishing our first postings abroad but funny enough
*27:12.600- 27:17.300* :  during our joint year and bon we were sharing the passion for theatre and took over the main
*27:17.300- 27:22.480* :  roles in a very modest theatre production that we organised as a group of diplomatic trainees
*27:22.480- 27:27.360* :  and you might be delighted to hear that it's Shakespeare that we chose and it was Love's
*27:27.360- 27:32.880* :  Labour's Lost where we played the main character. How romantic I love it so do you think that this
*27:32.880- 27:38.820* :  scheme is perhaps making diplomacy a bit more romantic or paving the way for couples to kind of
*27:38.820- 27:44.680* :  go forward into the world of diplomacy together? Never really looked at it like this but in a way I
*27:44.680- 27:50.220* :  can only say that sharing a job can be very good for a relationship. A suitably diplomatic answer
*27:50.220- 27:55.500* :  there. Ambassadors, Matthias Luttenberg and Churvin Bellman speaking to Isabella Jewel.
