*01:30.960- 01:34.960* :  You're listening to the happy part from one young world.
*01:39.980- 01:44.520* :  Hello, I'm Holly Gibbs and for this week's happy pod from the BBC World Service,
*01:45.020- 01:47.600* :  we are in Montreal for the one young world summit.
*01:47.920- 01:53.300* :  To the mob, be happy new in Montreal and welcome to one young world.
*01:54.200- 01:58.360* :  We've met young leaders and innovators from more than 190 countries
*01:58.360- 02:02.440* :  who have gathered to confront the biggest challenges facing humanity.
*02:02.440- 02:05.620* :  Despite the difficult themes discussed here in Canada,
*02:05.620- 02:10.600* :  the people we've met have shown so much optimism, hope and solutions for the future
*02:11.220- 02:14.300* :  and we're going to share their inspiring stories with you.
*02:14.640- 02:18.220* :  When you see the way that we challenge things and parliament,
*02:18.220- 02:22.880* :  they're just really different and it's definitely what I'm aligned to.
*02:23.220- 02:27.740* :  They're also using the knowledge they gain here to make a real difference back home.
*02:27.900- 02:33.180* :  I already know that there was sustainable and biodegradable products around the globe,
*02:33.180- 02:36.720* :  but I never had the chance to see this product in Brazil.
*02:37.000- 02:39.780* :  There are so many young people from around the world that really care.
*02:39.780- 02:43.620* :  I'm not alone in what I'm doing and there's other young change makers who are on the same path
*02:43.800- 02:46.940* :  and we all are going to we're going to change this world and it's one step at a time.
*02:53.000- 02:56.220* :  First up in Montreal is Hannah Rafiti Maipi Clark.
*02:56.280- 03:02.040* :  She became New Zealand's youngest MP for more than 170 years when she was elected
*03:02.040- 03:07.720* :  into parliament last year and it wasn't just her age that caught attention, so did this.
*03:14.260- 03:24.460* :  Hannah performed a ceremonial hacker, a traditional ritual of the Maori people.
*03:25.120- 03:29.960* :  Her work has gathered global recognition and now she's been named as one of the politicians of
*03:29.960- 03:36.280* :  the year at the One Young World Summit here in Canada. So what's it like being a 22-year-old MP?
*03:36.280- 03:42.080* :  Our reporter, Jacob Evans, caught up with Hannah and began by asking her how she felt after winning
*03:42.080- 03:46.220* :  the award. Very humbled, Fais is a saying,
*03:48.640- 03:55.560* :  which means the sweet potato will never say how sweet it is, so I'm accepting this award,
*03:55.560- 03:58.920* :  not for myself, but for the people around me who've raised me.
*03:59.480- 04:00.560* :  So how did you get into politics?
*04:01.080- 04:05.620* :  Okay, so never been into politics, but I am into standing up for our people.
*04:05.980- 04:11.900* :  My grandparents have been heavily involved in kind of always challenging the status quo
*04:12.360- 04:17.360* :  through activism, so I've always kind of just been surrounded in that environment,
*04:17.980- 04:24.060* :  which I guess inspired me to the party that I'm a part of as the party Māori,
*04:24.060- 04:29.760* :  which is an all-indigenous party. When you see the way that we challenge things in parliament,
*04:30.300- 04:34.440* :  they're just really different and it's definitely what I'm aligned to.
*04:35.380- 04:38.980* :  I'm talking about challenging things in parliament. You went viral for doing the Haka
*04:39.540- 04:42.960* :  in parliament. Talk to me about that and how important it was for you to do that.
*04:43.220- 04:51.380* :  So Haka is a form of expression. It's more than a performance. It's more so a
*04:52.940- 04:57.640* :  guess physical embodiment of expressing our culture. We do that through singing,
*04:57.640- 05:05.160* :  chance, instruments, but this Haka was not for anyone else. It was purely just to calm my
*05:05.160- 05:09.940* :  nerves down and that's what I'm used to do. So, you know, being 22 and being a parliament,
*05:09.940- 05:15.700* :  you're the youngest elected MP in 170 years. What's that like? Do you think people treat you differently
*05:15.700- 05:22.100* :  for being so young? I think there's many factors like being young, being female and also being
*05:22.100- 05:28.980* :  Māori is super, super challenging. Not just for myself, but for us as a people. And then at the
*05:28.980- 05:38.620* :  same time, I'm 22, so my outlook on it is that I want our people to see us living and thriving.
*05:39.520- 05:43.220* :  And so, you know, we talked to you about as you as a politician, but what about you as a person?
*05:43.220- 05:47.640* :  What are your friends make of this journey around it? So, I've got to my best friends actually
*05:47.640- 05:51.980* :  here on the trip with me and I've got some of my, I've got a kapa ka group that is with me as well
*05:52.480- 05:57.220* :  and that just goes to the saying that I didn't want to come here alone and I'm never put in positions
*05:57.220- 06:02.140* :  where I'm alone. I travel as much as I can with free generation. So, my parents and my grandparents
*06:02.140- 06:06.600* :  and anyone from those generations. And it's important that I travel with three generations,
*06:07.320- 06:13.500* :  even though it's a little bit costly because there's also something that we call tekanga, which is
*06:13.500- 06:22.380* :  customs that keep us safe. And I guess that is why my strong foundation, why I'm able to do the
*06:22.380- 06:28.080* :  work that I can do because my foundation is so strong and I'm protected. And are you just like
*06:28.080- 06:35.980* :  every other normal 22-year-olds? Definitely. You chronically online. Yeah, I'm a sucker for Tik Tok.
*06:35.980- 06:40.580* :  I'll just scroll constantly, like this morning, like for two hours, I should have been doing work.
*06:40.660- 06:47.740* :  But I guess I don't see them as guilty pleasures, but actually now I've reframed that to
*06:48.600- 06:53.980* :  self-care. So, it's okay to go on my phone, to watch movies, to watch Netflix.
*06:54.900- 06:58.620* :  And so, lastly, what's your ambition? What do you want to do in the future?
*07:00.200- 07:05.080* :  I don't want to do in the future. I don't even know what I'm doing tomorrow.
*07:05.080- 07:10.540* :  Jacob Evans speaking with Hannah Rafiti May Piclach.
*07:11.280- 07:15.420* :  Now to technology that aims to stop cyberbullying before the damage is done.
*07:15.980- 07:21.820* :  Trisha Prabhu, who's 24 years old, has been recognised at this summit for her company Rethink,
*07:21.820- 07:27.580* :  and it all started when she took a free coding class at her local library. I met with Trisha
*07:27.860- 07:31.080* :  and started by asking her why she wanted to create the technology.
*07:31.920- 07:35.460* :  Unfortunately, at first, I had my own experience with online harassment,
*07:35.460- 07:40.280* :  like so many members of Gen Z today. Sadly, it's become a right of passage in some ways for our
*07:40.280- 07:45.020* :  generation. I, for a very long time, I think, like a lot of victims thought there was something wrong
*07:45.020- 07:51.440* :  with me that I was the problem. And my wake-up call was realising much later, a couple years later,
*07:51.920- 07:55.980* :  that in fact cyberbullying was a silent pandemic, because I started to read and see new stories
*07:55.980- 08:01.720* :  of other young people who had been cyberbullied sometimes in extreme ways with really damaging
*08:01.720- 08:07.900* :  consequences. I was just horrified, and I could not believe that, you know, it was in the news
*08:07.900- 08:12.640* :  cycle and then it would disappear, and it was almost like we were accepting that that was just the
*08:12.640- 08:19.120* :  world we had to live it. I felt like I could not be a bystander to that, and I decided, okay,
*08:19.200- 08:25.360* :  I have to do something. And a bit about you. You have been nominated as the entrepreneur of the
*08:25.360- 08:31.500* :  One Young World Summit. How does that feel? It feels very surreal. I remember getting the
*08:31.500- 08:38.460* :  email thinking, oh my goodness, me, I was, I was so, um, so flirt and just so grateful. I think it's
*08:38.460- 08:44.240* :  a testament to the power of young people's voices to do things. Value in our world is not just
*08:44.240- 08:48.820* :  monetary, and I think that that's something that business needs to wake up to more and more.
*08:48.820- 08:53.520* :  And I think social entrepreneurship is a really beautiful example of how you can build an
*08:53.520- 08:58.560* :  organization that has tremendous impact that you're incredibly proud of, and create value in a
*08:58.560- 09:03.380* :  lot of different ways. But you can also create a world that's consistent with the values that
*09:03.380- 09:08.120* :  you want to live. And we do that by building technology that helps you to pause and rethink
*09:08.120- 09:12.880* :  before they say something that could be offensive. Our vision is really to get young people to
*09:12.880- 09:16.720* :  embrace the intentionality and criticality that they may apply in in-person settings,
*09:17.200- 09:21.820* :  but they may not do online. And in doing so, really create this revolution around the digital
*09:21.880- 09:26.080* :  world, where we are centering positivity and kindness in our interactions, instead of a lot of
*09:26.080- 09:30.500* :  the toxicity and hate that characterizes a lot of our digital experience today. And have you had
*09:30.500- 09:35.520* :  any use of feedback from people that use rethink? Yes, and that's probably one of one of the most
*09:35.520- 09:41.120* :  special parts of my job is hearing from young people who have, you know, benefited from the technology
*09:41.120- 09:46.880* :  in some way. A lot of the discourse we have around cyberbullies today, the message is very much,
*09:46.880- 09:50.700* :  these kids are awful. And if you think about it, you know, the fundamental assumption that
*09:50.700- 09:56.040* :  rethink is rooted on is, no, it's not that, you know, we're all awful people or Gen Z is just so
*09:56.040- 10:00.780* :  terrible. It's that we've been put in this environment that is so frictionless and, you know,
*10:01.000- 10:05.540* :  can feel so ephemeral that you'll say and do things that you would never do in person. And so what
*10:05.540- 10:09.700* :  we need to do is to be able to reclaim our humanity online. Some of the funniest feedback I
*10:09.700- 10:15.120* :  receive is from adults, actually, who will tell me, I need this for my work email. How do you balance
*10:15.120- 10:21.740* :  being 24 and achieving everything that you have? It's a lot. There are definitely days where,
*10:21.940- 10:26.080* :  you know, I wish it got in a little bit more sleep or days where it can feel a little surreal. The
*10:26.120- 10:29.980* :  shifts, like I remember in high school, because I started this work when I was 13, you know,
*10:29.980- 10:35.140* :  sometimes I would go from like a math test to receiving an award on an international stage and
*10:35.140- 10:39.900* :  it was like the stark contrast between those things could be kind of funny. But I mean, for me,
*10:39.900- 10:44.320* :  balancing it all, I think is having a supportive community around me. Those are professional mentors,
*10:44.320- 10:50.020* :  but it's also family and friends, people who know me for me and celebrate for me for me and all
*10:50.020- 10:54.520* :  of the context that, you know, I appear in whether it's me just being a 24-year-old and, you know,
*10:54.520- 10:58.900* :  going out with some friends and getting dinner, or it's me as founder and CEO doing this work.
*10:58.900- 11:03.520* :  So I think that is really, really helpful. Did you always want to be an entrepreneur? I did not. No,
*11:03.540- 11:09.460* :  I am. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a princess and then I wanted to be an astronaut and then I
*11:09.460- 11:13.160* :  wanted to be an author for the longest time. There's still time to become a princess.
*11:14.680- 11:19.820* :  This is the happy pod. What makes you happy? I think seeing young people do things that make our
*11:19.820- 11:24.620* :  world better makes me really, really happy because it gives me a lot of hope for the future of our world.
*11:25.580- 11:31.080* :  That was Trisha Prabe. Around the world, millions of women and girls still cannot afford
*11:31.080- 11:36.280* :  menstrual products or even have access to them. It's called period poverty and one young
*11:36.280- 11:42.040* :  activist is hoping to eradicate it in her native Brazil. There, one in four do not have access
*11:42.040- 11:48.280* :  to sanitary products. Patricia Zinella created her country's first 100% biodegradable sanitary pad
*11:48.280- 11:54.380* :  and uses local communities to distribute them to every corner of Brazil. She've only he saw her
*11:54.380- 12:02.420* :  at the summit. We saw menstrual poverty in our daily routine, so I already spotted
*12:02.420- 12:11.260* :  woman's bi pads and when I started this program, I was thinking how this woman that don't have
*12:11.260- 12:19.040* :  access to pads when she didn't find someone like me that will support her what this woman will do
*12:19.040- 12:26.040* :  on the next month. I already know that there was sustainable and biodegradable products around
*12:26.040- 12:32.220* :  the club, but I never had the chance to see this product in Brazil. So you employ women
*12:32.220- 12:39.540* :  to make the sanitary pads, is that right? Yeah. So that's a kind of a whole new way of engaging
*12:39.540- 12:46.160* :  women, like you say, into work, but you've got the sanitary pad in front of us. Do you want to show us
*12:46.220- 12:51.260* :  what makes it different? Because I'm looking at it, doesn't look any different to an ordinary sanitary
*12:51.260- 13:00.140* :  pad? Yeah, the difference is that he didn't take 500 years to decompose just six months. We were
*13:00.140- 13:09.380* :  able to do this using raw materials from Brazil, so it's from Bumble, cellos, natural glue, so
*13:10.000- 13:15.960* :  all the process is really natural and all the fibers are hypothertonic.
*13:17.020- 13:23.700* :  So let me have a little feel. Oh, it's very nice to soft. Yeah, so how do you get these out to
*13:23.700- 13:29.060* :  people who need them the most? How are they reaching the people who experience menstrual poverty?
*13:30.180- 13:37.380* :  So this is the most incredible part of work. We are able to work with different stakeholders
*13:38.200- 13:44.500* :  to provide first of all the funding for the production. So the women that are producing also have
*13:44.500- 13:52.080* :  access to the pads. When we see the production, we already know where this production will
*13:53.100- 14:00.000* :  go. So for example, our last production, it was 100% to donation for NGOs in Salvador,
*14:00.000- 14:06.620* :  Bahia. And this is incredible because we had the chance to have sponsors that provide us
*14:06.620- 14:13.720* :  the funding for due this production. And after this, we were able to give this production.
*14:14.380- 14:21.300* :  We are rethinking the way that pads are done and distributed to the needs of the communities that
*14:21.300- 14:25.360* :  we are working for. Patricia Zinella speaking with Chavon Lehi.
*14:30.800- 14:35.080* :  You're listening to a special edition of The Happy Pot recorded at the One Young World Summit
*14:35.080- 14:41.040* :  in Montreal, Canada. Coming up, Prince William said he loved what we do and he actually
*14:41.040- 14:47.240* :  went on to call me the Queen of Africa, which was really insane. The teenage mom turned CEO
*14:47.240- 14:49.340* :  who caught the eye of royalty.

*16:14.340- 16:19.360* :  Some say a picture is worth a thousand words. And that's the case for Cesar de Sfouli,
*16:19.360- 16:24.660* :  a Spanish-Iranian photojournalist who is one of the winners of the one young world journalist
*16:24.660- 16:30.520* :  of the year award. His work focuses on migration, human rights and international affairs.
*16:31.220- 16:33.940* :  I asked Cesar what it feels like to be a winner.
*16:34.620- 16:39.620* :  It's a pleasure to be part of a community that is recognizing young leaders around the world.
*16:39.620- 16:45.040* :  And it's, yeah, I mean, I feel honoured. And it's a responsibility as well because there are
*16:45.040- 16:49.660* :  like important names that were awarded before and people who are doing my thing. And it feels
*16:50.680- 16:55.440* :  big to be among them. It's been like 12 years. I'm working as a photojournalist.
*16:55.720- 17:02.460* :  I think and I believe that photography is a language that we use in daily basis.
*17:02.740- 17:07.320* :  That is a specific language to tell things. It's so important these days that we need people
*17:07.320- 17:13.560* :  who are experts on communicating through photography. So what I do is to make sure that the stories
*17:13.560- 17:19.620* :  I tell through photography are meaningful, are journalistic, and to make sure that I send messages
*17:19.620- 17:24.600* :  on the right way through photography. And talk to us a bit about the power of photography.
*17:24.980- 17:30.980* :  You can send very different messages through one same picture. So when you are making a photograph,
*17:30.980- 17:36.980* :  you can probably direct the way people will interact with every reality that you are photographing.
*17:36.980- 17:42.480* :  So you can photograph a reality from a perspective that is going to create hope and interest and
*17:42.480- 17:48.660* :  happiness depends on what you want to create. Or you can create drama. You can create or repeat
*17:48.660- 17:54.840* :  stereotypes that have already been built on those realities. I have been trying to run away from
*17:56.140- 18:02.620* :  the usual representation of migrants. Usually this construction of the migrant identity as a mass
*18:03.120- 18:08.020* :  as people that we cannot connect with. We cannot identify. And what I do is to photograph
*18:08.020- 18:13.560* :  individuals that I always name. I always know who they are. And I tell their stories from a
*18:13.560- 18:19.060* :  closer perspective. But in context where we can identify with them. So we can see regular people
*18:19.060- 18:24.080* :  having regular lives in regular spaces to tell this story from a positive perspective, from a
*18:24.640- 18:31.480* :  better perspective, from a more human empathetic perspective that helps audiences to connect.
*18:31.480- 18:36.940* :  It makes my work make sense. How does it feel to be making waves as a young person? And what would
*18:36.940- 18:42.720* :  you say to other young people who want to get into a field that is mostly dominated by people not
*18:42.720- 18:49.800* :  their age? So my advice is to build a thing. What do you do to make sure you don't judge too much
*18:49.800- 18:54.200* :  the ones who are there. But try to understand what they do and where they are there. And try to
*18:54.200- 18:58.900* :  bring something with you. Try to find what you can add to those structures that are already
*18:58.900- 19:04.240* :  existing and how you can improve them and make sure that you are respectful with the realities
*19:04.240- 19:12.500* :  that you are reporting on. How are you going to celebrate your award? I don't know. I didn't plan.
*19:14.440- 19:19.540* :  I think we're going to probably party tonight and celebrate. Hopefully, I don't know. And then
*19:19.540- 19:25.180* :  with friends when I'm back home. But I didn't plan a celebration. Caesar just flew away.
*19:26.260- 19:31.060* :  Another business leader who's been honoured here in Montreal is Charlotte Magui, the founder of
*19:31.060- 19:37.340* :  Makuru Clean Stoves. Charlotte grew up in one of the biggest slums in Nairobi. By the age of 10 she
*19:37.340- 19:42.700* :  was an orphan and its 16 she became a mother, leading her to drop out of school and find a job
*19:42.700- 19:47.800* :  selling charcoal. Then when her daughter suffered severe burns from her traditional stove,
*19:48.340- 19:53.100* :  Charlotte was inspired to create her own business, producing child and environmentally friendly
*19:53.100- 19:59.440* :  stoves that can now be found in two million homes across Kenya. She also won the 2022
*19:59.460- 20:06.060* :  earth shop prize. She's been speaking to the happy-pods Chavon Lehi. Initially, I just wanted to build
*20:06.060- 20:11.420* :  a more stable stove to limit the risk of bouncing children under the age of five. And while doing
*20:11.420- 20:16.160* :  more research on that was when I realised that, you know, household air pollution and high cost
*20:16.860- 20:22.340* :  fuel were also a factor and I needed to solve all three. So then I went on ahead and designed
*20:22.340- 20:28.920* :  a stove that would then go and solve three problems. When did you know that you had become successful?
*20:29.020- 20:34.780* :  When did that moment happen? I think I've had different moments where I've felt again because
*20:34.780- 20:39.380* :  you're an entrepreneur, so you never really felt successful and then the days when you feel like
*20:39.380- 20:45.220* :  a loser the days that you feel like you know invisible. And the more recent moment was I think when
*20:45.220- 20:51.980* :  I was in London for climate week and Prince William said he loved what we do and he actually
*20:51.980- 20:58.540* :  went on to call me the Queen of Africa which was really insane but I thought he wouldn't do that
*20:58.540- 21:06.440* :  if he didn't think what we do is inspirational and impactful and that is such a moment of pride
*21:06.440- 21:11.960* :  for me because when then things don't go right or when I'm struggling I replay that moment in my head.
*21:11.960- 21:18.160* :  Yeah. So obviously you said you feel very grateful to win these awards but how do you stay
*21:18.160- 21:24.920* :  happy? How do you stay positive? What makes you really yeah really happy? I think what makes me happy
*21:25.160- 21:33.600* :  is seeing the life that I have managed to be peeled for myself. My my life was going to take a
*21:33.620- 21:38.920* :  very different time. Like this was not what I was going to live up to be. I wasn't going to have
*21:38.920- 21:43.600* :  the family that I have. I wasn't going to have you know the work that I have so I got really lucky
*21:43.700- 21:54.840* :  and is knowing that I was I was one choice away from living a very different life and every day
*21:54.840- 21:59.000* :  things that make you happy that get you motivated because you know what everyone has those mornings
*21:59.000- 22:02.860* :  where they get up and they go I don't want to go to work but you've got a big company you have a
*22:02.860- 22:09.160* :  very busy schedule how do you keep yourself motivated and keep yourself happy. Yeah. Oh man I love
*22:09.380- 22:15.520* :  food so every day if I wake up and I'm having a difficult day and I smell pancakes or like
*22:16.020- 22:21.080* :  I know there's some sweet corn in my fridge that I can boil and eat it brings me so much joy
*22:21.080- 22:29.740* :  and books books are my favorite pick up just because books also did save my life but those are some
*22:29.740- 22:35.420* :  of the things that every day when it gets rough I'm very easy to make happy just give me pancakes
*22:35.420- 22:42.880* :  so sweet corn. I want to talk about that books saved your life what do you mean by that. I mean
*22:42.880- 22:50.180* :  the place that I grew up was as you know quite dangerous you know and just not it wasn't a pretty
*22:50.180- 22:55.880* :  life a lot of the people I grew up with the way life timed out for them was very different
*22:56.660- 23:03.280* :  but my love for books saved me because of the fact that I could I was able to speak differently
*23:03.960- 23:10.780* :  I had great vocabulary and so the first chance that books ever gave me was getting penpals because
*23:10.780- 23:16.200* :  I could write composition really well and so I got penpal pals from the UK from the US and I
*23:16.200- 23:21.400* :  would just write through a bunch of kids my age and that helped give me opportunities to see
*23:21.400- 23:27.480* :  their outside world the world outside of Mukuru when I say books have my life I mean I would have
*23:27.480- 23:32.780* :  a completely different life if I couldn't communicate and I was able to communicate because of the
*23:32.780- 23:39.360* :  fact that I loved reading. Charlotte Magaier from the north of Nigeria to the front cover of Forbes
*23:39.360- 23:46.080* :  magazine with no business training or fashion experience Fatima Babakura created a luxury accessories
*23:46.080- 23:51.860* :  brand and now she's giving back to the community that raised her Shavon caught up with her at the
*23:51.860- 23:58.020* :  one young world summit. So growing up in Nigeria and another girl and another girl means that you
*23:58.020- 24:03.720* :  know we're very conservative we go to school we come back and usually like after a university you
*24:04.100- 24:09.900* :  you aspire to marriage even if you do end up getting a career it's like you do it but you don't
*24:09.900- 24:15.420* :  put it in our faces you know very quiet that's what the culture is and so you know having to like
*24:15.420- 24:20.980* :  just explain to people why I do things and do it like on a global stage you know be out there
*24:20.980- 24:26.360* :  be on like news interviews like just showing myself a lot of people didn't understand
*24:27.120- 24:33.400* :  mostly you know the male figures in like our society is you know something that was challenging
*24:33.400- 24:38.600* :  but it's you know I've done it and it's inspired a lot of people to now want to like start businesses
*24:38.640- 24:44.980* :  while maintaining those values and like cultural like norms. Since building my businesses I've
*24:44.980- 24:51.220* :  realized what really keeps me like in it and also happy is just the why the reason why I do it
*24:51.560- 24:56.240* :  so with my perfumes business for example beyond you know like making money as you know as
*24:56.240- 25:01.700* :  with any business it's also to empower the women who come from where I come from you know it's a
*25:01.700- 25:07.980* :  community that has been affected by Boko Haram it's a community of women who are not like entrepreneurs
*25:08.020- 25:13.480* :  but support their family the little way that they could and so you know we work with women like
*25:13.520- 25:19.380* :  that to be able to make our incense and what we've done is you know take some of our profits
*25:19.380- 25:26.240* :  actually 50% of our profit and send it to them and so it's really the reason why I do things
*25:26.300- 25:30.920* :  is to just make sure that beyond making money and making impact and like people's lives especially
*25:30.920- 25:37.220* :  the lives of women. Okay so now on to the very glamorous part tell me about your collection what
*25:37.220- 25:44.080* :  you design. So I love to think about my shoe and bag business as you know every day is a party
*25:44.640- 25:48.900* :  you should be able to wear something that makes you feel like you're celebrating yourself even if
*25:48.900- 25:53.140* :  you weren't going to an event you know something that makes you feel you're most confident you're
*25:53.140- 26:01.080* :  most happy in our shoes and our bags. I hear that a certain Beyonce has worn one of your bags I mean
*26:01.160- 26:09.220* :  what? Yeah so in 2020 when Beyonce did the compilation of like black businesses in the world we
*26:09.220- 26:14.760* :  were lucky to be featured in you know in that list and it was really beautiful and I felt very
*26:14.760- 26:19.680* :  honored and you know it changed a lot of things for our business. Oh my gosh what was that
*26:19.680- 26:25.580* :  moment like when you realized Beyonce had singled out your business? Honestly at first I thought
*26:25.580- 26:31.180* :  it was a joke I thought it was fake because I received the email from someone who had seen the list
*26:31.180- 26:37.180* :  so he sent me the link and said oh you've just been featured on Beyonce.com and so I sent him a
*26:37.180- 26:45.160* :  message replying and saying show me proof I don't believe you. And I did click it and it was real
*26:45.520- 26:49.940* :  and I was just like all over the place and you know I went to my mom my mom doesn't know who Beyonce is
*26:50.500- 26:54.440* :  and she goes so what does that mean? I'm like you don't worry about it you're going to see what it
*26:54.440- 26:58.580* :  means and then you know shortly after we decided to get orders I'm like this is what it means. What
*26:58.580- 27:05.080* :  advice do you have for people who want to make a difference? Like it doesn't have to be big honestly
*27:05.080- 27:10.220* :  I don't consider like any of the things that I do big enough so you know start with changing one
*27:10.220- 27:14.740* :  person's life if you were just being kind to someone with the words that you share with them
*27:15.100- 27:20.600* :  put in their names in like rooms where they're not present that you know might change their life
*27:21.080- 27:26.780* :  I think just start with that and you know these things multiply. She's only he speaking to Fatima
*27:26.780- 27:37.260* :  Baba Kura and that's all from the happy pod for now we'd love to hear from you as ever the
*27:37.260- 27:43.160* :  address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk this edition was made by the team here in Montreal
*27:43.160- 27:49.580* :  Shavon Lee he Jacob Evans and our editor Karen Martin I'm Holly Gibbs and let's give the last
*27:49.580- 27:57.200* :  words to the participants of the 2024 one young world summit. I'm leaving this summit feeling a
*27:57.200- 28:02.680* :  lot less isolated because I had had the privilege of being surrounded by community being surrounded
*28:02.680- 28:07.980* :  by other young advocates and I feel like I'm leaving here connected to a community folks who are
*28:07.980- 28:13.320* :  doing really good work and I know going forward if I'm facing difficulties if I'm facing challenges
*28:13.540- 28:17.360* :  there are people I've now connected to that I can reach out to for support there's a community
*28:17.360- 28:23.240* :  that I can lead on. I'm so inspired already about the amazing work people are doing we walk to
*28:23.240- 28:28.460* :  help girls and women to end gender disturbance child marriage and female gender legislation so I'm
*28:28.460- 28:33.940* :  very much inspired to go back to my country to do more work to you know to work harder to help
*28:33.940- 28:38.780* :  girls and women to live up to their full potential. It has really reenstealed my belief in
*28:38.780- 28:43.220* :  humanity and my optimism for the future and there are so many young people from around the world
*28:43.220- 28:47.220* :  that really care I'm not alone in what I'm doing and there's other young change makers who are
*28:47.220- 28:51.540* :  on the same path or different paths and we all are gonna we're gonna change this world and it's
*28:51.540- 28:58.120* :  one step at a time we are strong alone for sure every person has the ability to lead a movement
*28:58.120- 29:04.100* :  but we are so much stronger together. You know what I was saying yesterday before bed I was like
