*01:19.860- 01:22.640* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.380- 01:29.540* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 30th of September. These are our main stories.
*01:29.540- 01:35.640* :  Israel expands its military operation in Lebanon. Our correspondent has been speaking to people caught
*01:35.640- 01:42.840* :  up in the violence in the Bicar Valley. She wasn't responding and her head was bashed open
*01:42.840- 01:46.960* :  with blood pooling under her. Her brother had an eye injury.
*01:47.920- 01:53.500* :  Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Rally Party, has gone on trial in Paris charged with
*01:53.500- 02:02.140* :  corruption. Also in this podcast and historic moment as Britain shuts its last coal-fired power
*02:02.140- 02:11.900* :  station, the first G7 nation to do so. It's three days since an Israeli air strike killed the
*02:11.900- 02:17.560* :  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon and tensions are very high in the Middle East.
*02:17.960- 02:23.160* :  Israel has continued with its air strikes against Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militant groups
*02:23.560- 02:28.380* :  and it's amassing its troops at the border with Lebanon, giving the impression that they're ready
*02:28.380- 02:34.560* :  for a possible ground invasion. Our senior international correspondent Alla Garen reports now from
*02:34.560- 02:40.820* :  the React Hospital in the Bicar Valley in Lebanon. You may find some of the details in her report
*02:40.820- 02:47.500* :  upsetting. I'm standing outside a ward in a pediatric intensive care unit.
*02:48.240- 02:53.820* :  There's a six-year-old girl inside in the bed closest to the window. She's called Nour.
*02:54.720- 03:01.760* :  Her head is bandaged and she's seriously ill. Her mother Rima is with me.
*03:02.500- 03:06.980* :  Rima, can you tell me what happened? How did Nour get these injuries?
*03:07.860- 03:15.260* :  We were sat right by the front door not brave enough to go inside because we thought the building
*03:15.260- 03:22.460* :  would collapse on us if it was hit. Then when the bombing got closer and more intense we decided
*03:22.460- 03:28.740* :  to go in whatever the consequences. I picked up Nour and her brother but the missile was much faster
*03:28.740- 03:35.300* :  than I was. The next thing I remember I was on the floor and when I got up it was obvious.
*03:36.140- 03:43.840* :  She was the one most badly hurt. She wasn't responding and her head was bashed open with blood
*03:43.840- 03:50.220* :  pooling under her. Her brother had an eye injury. All her cousins were also on the floor hurt.
*03:52.040- 03:59.020* :  Before Nour was injured was she very scared because of what was going on. Could you hear a lot
*03:59.020- 04:07.640* :  of explosions in the past few days? Yes. I would try and soothe her telling her not to be afraid
*04:07.640- 04:15.960* :  but nothing would happen. She called on God and the prophets for help. But it was her fate to be
*04:15.960- 04:28.300* :  hurt the worst. Well within the last few seconds we've had a strike. We heard the plane in the
*04:28.300- 04:35.700* :  air. Then we felt the impact. The windows here shook. They rattled and it's an indication of how
*04:36.120- 04:42.320* :  nowhere here is safe. Even patients in hospitals can't feel completely safe.
*04:44.940- 04:51.840* :  With me is the medical director Dr. Basel Abdullah. Dr. Tell me what kind of cases have you
*04:51.840- 04:59.460* :  been receiving in recent days of people wounded by Israeli attacks? In total we had more than 400
*04:59.460- 05:03.840* :  injured patients. Almost the majority of the patients are coming from the same family.
*05:04.680- 05:12.120* :  And are you receiving casualties every day? Yeah every day. It must be very difficult for you and
*05:12.120- 05:17.960* :  for your colleagues to be receiving so many wounded in such a short space of time. Seeing children
*05:17.960- 05:23.940* :  bombed, seeing elderly patients, seeing women bombed, it's difficult. The majority of the nurses,
*05:25.280- 05:35.100* :  doctors are depressed. An ambulance has just arrived now bringing casualties from the latest
*05:35.100- 05:41.140* :  air strike. They're being treated in the emergency department. There's a lot of anger and
*05:41.180- 05:45.660* :  tension. People are stressed. Wondering when this is going to stop.
*05:47.300- 05:55.440* :  That was all a garrin. Hezbollah's deputy leader, Niam Kasim, has insisted that it will fight back
*05:55.980- 06:00.900* :  and that despite the death of Hasan Nasrallah and other Hezbollah commanders, the group's military
*06:00.900- 06:10.260* :  capacity has not been diminished. The Islamic resistance will continue to confront the Israeli
*06:10.260- 06:16.180* :  enemy in solidarity with Gaza and Palestine, in defense of Lebanon and its people,
*06:16.900- 06:20.820* :  and in response to the assassinations of leaders and the killing of civilians.
*06:21.780- 06:26.460* :  We recognize that the battle may be long and all options are available to us.
*06:27.080- 06:32.940* :  Should the Israelis decide to launch a grand invasion, the resistance forces are ready to engage
*06:32.940- 06:37.940* :  with it. Our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bashayga has this assessment from Beirut.
*06:38.600- 06:44.480* :  I think it's a fact that Hezbollah has been heavily damaged by two weeks of intense Israeli
*06:44.480- 06:50.680* :  air strikes. It's entirely the ship has been decimated. They are in a difficult position obviously
*06:50.900- 06:57.360* :  and their communications network has been breached. It is very difficult to see how they are going
*06:57.360- 07:03.780* :  to come up with some kind of coordinated response to these attacks. Niam Kasim said the group is
*07:03.780- 07:10.020* :  ready to confront any Israeli grounding vision of Lebanon. So the signs coming from Israel
*07:10.020- 07:16.500* :  suggest that this is imminent. Yoav Galant, the Israeli defense minister was visiting troops
*07:16.500- 07:22.040* :  along the border. He said the killing of Hasan Nasrallah was a very important step but not
*07:22.040- 07:27.780* :  the final one. And I think here in Lebanon this is the concern that we're going to see a wider
*07:28.200- 07:33.200* :  Israeli campaign against Hezbollah, including a grounding vision of Saudi Lebanon to
*07:33.400- 07:38.080* :  create what the Israeli officials described as a buffer zone in the south to destroy the
*07:38.080- 07:43.780* :  infrastructure that has been created by Hezbollah and push Hezbollah away from the border. So
*07:43.780- 07:49.620* :  he was defiant but the situation is very different for Hezbollah. Hugo, the Lebanese prime minister
*07:49.700- 07:55.640* :  Najib Mekati has just been saying that he is ready to send troops of the Lebanese army to the
*07:55.640- 08:01.420* :  southern border. One would imagine that would be worrying for Israel because it would put Hezbollah
*08:01.920- 08:06.760* :  and the Lebanese armed forces on the same side. Yeah, I mean it's very difficult to see how
*08:06.760- 08:13.140* :  any kind of deal or any kind of negotiation can reach a ceasefire at the moment. The Israelis
*08:13.620- 08:18.980* :  think they are being extremely successful with the operation they've carried out so far in terms
*08:18.980- 08:25.020* :  of weakening Hezbollah and they want to change the reality along the border. So the Lebanese are
*08:25.020- 08:30.280* :  saying that they are ready to implement the United Nations Resolution 1701 which is the
*08:30.280- 08:35.840* :  resolution that was approved in 2006 to put an end to the last war between Hezbollah and Israel.
*08:36.140- 08:40.340* :  And I think it's very difficult to see why the Israelis would accept any kind of deal at the
*08:40.340- 08:49.200* :  moment. They feel that they have inflicted a significant blow and they believe that they
*08:49.200- 08:56.060* :  have the momentum now to degrade Hezbollah quite significantly to again change the situation
*08:56.180- 09:00.220* :  along the border. They say that the goal of this operation is to allow the return of those
*09:00.460- 09:05.660* :  60,000 residents who have been displaced because of those rockets that have been fired by Hezbollah.
*09:05.680- 09:10.880* :  So very difficult to see how any kind of diplomatic solution can be found right now.
*09:10.880- 09:17.380* :  Hugo Baschaiga. Let's head to the French capital Paris now where Marine Le Pen, the leader of the
*09:17.380- 09:23.420* :  right wing populist party, the National Rally, is on trial for allegedly misusing European
*09:23.420- 09:29.720* :  parliamentary funds. So how serious is this for her personally and for her political ambitions?
*09:30.300- 09:33.140* :  Our correspondent Hugh Schofield is following events at the court.
*09:33.900- 09:41.200* :  She's accused of presiding over a system going back many years in which party workers at a time
*09:41.200- 09:46.580* :  when the party was in financial difficulty were paid effectively not with the party's own money
*09:46.580- 09:53.420* :  but with European money. The system relates to MEP's people working as deputies in Brussels
*09:53.900- 10:01.080* :  who 15 years ago the party had several 20 or more of these MEP's. They all get an envelope from
*10:01.080- 10:05.380* :  the Parliament money to pay for assistance. In theory these assistance should be people
*10:05.380- 10:10.160* :  are helping purely with parliamentary work in Strasbourg and Brussels but what the party is accused
*10:10.160- 10:15.440* :  of doing is using that money to pay Paris-based workers who occasionally would take trips up to
*10:15.740- 10:19.360* :  Strasbourg to sort of keep up the front that they were working in the Parliament but weren't
*10:19.360- 10:25.400* :  really, were basically fully fledged members of the party apparatus in Paris. That's the accusation
*10:25.400- 10:29.980* :  of course that's saying it's not true and they're saying also that Brussels is a European
*10:29.980- 10:34.860* :  Parliament was placed where this kind of thing went on to varying degrees a lot.
*10:35.620- 10:40.120* :  Hugh, her party did extremely well in European parliamentary elections earlier this year.
*10:40.620- 10:45.060* :  It looked at one stage as if she was going to be the largest party in the French parliamentary
*10:45.060- 10:50.500* :  elections. It said it was in the first round so her party is riding high. What would a guilty verdict
*10:50.500- 10:55.900* :  mean for her and her party? Well I think there are two things there. One thing is the kind of
*10:56.200- 11:02.500* :  technical consequence of her being found guilty and possibly declared ineligible for public
*11:02.500- 11:07.600* :  office. That would be a huge blow to her personal ambitions. There's no guarantee that it would
*11:07.600- 11:12.280* :  happen even if she's found guilty. It's that one possible punishment would be this punishment of
*11:12.280- 11:18.580* :  ineligibility for five years, which would mean she couldn't run for president in 2027. That
*11:18.580- 11:24.960* :  would be a major blow. The other side of this thing, what would it do to the image of the party?
*11:24.960- 11:30.080* :  What would it do to it standing as a vote winner in France? I think there the answer is rather
*11:30.080- 11:35.340* :  different. I think such as the cynicism towards Europe and towards the establishment in general,
*11:35.800- 11:41.120* :  a lot of people will simply say, well okay she's been found guilty I don't care. In fact once
*11:41.120- 11:46.640* :  again it's the system attacking an outsider. I think it politically, overall for the party,
*11:46.640- 11:51.560* :  it would probably make little difference if she was found guilty. In fact it might even help them.
*11:52.140- 11:55.780* :  Huge scope field. Japan's incoming prime minister has called a
*11:55.780- 12:01.520* :  snap general election for the end of October. Shigeru Ishiba was only elected as leader of the
*12:01.520- 12:07.040* :  ruling liberal democratic party on Friday and is due to be approved as prime minister in parliament
*12:07.040- 12:12.280* :  on Tuesday. I'll start Asia Pacific editor Mickey Bristo. Why call an election now?
*12:13.060- 12:19.060* :  He probably feels that he wants to establish his administration with legitimacy in the eyes of
*12:19.060- 12:23.480* :  the public. In fact at a press conference, as exactly what he said, he wanted to give people
*12:23.940- 12:28.880* :  the earliest opportunity to test his administration, which he's still developing by the way. He hasn't
*12:28.880- 12:34.280* :  really announced his whole cabinet yet. There's probably a little bit more to it than that though,
*12:34.280- 12:40.680* :  because the race to allow him to become prime minister of Japan through the LDP was a really tight
*12:40.680- 12:46.360* :  one. There were nine candidates. Initially there was a runoff with a challenge between two people.
*12:46.360- 12:52.300* :  He just won. So it's probably more about establishing his legitimacy with the public to give him
*12:52.300- 12:58.620* :  credibility within the LDP. That's perhaps why he's called the election now. Now is this a gamble,
*12:58.620- 13:03.540* :  though, for him and also for the liberal party because he is coming to office on the back of the
*13:03.760- 13:08.740* :  corruption scandal, isn't he? He is. Elections are always dangerous in democracies because you don't
*13:08.740- 13:14.200* :  know who's going to win. Less so in Japan because the LDP has been in power mostly in the post-war
*13:14.200- 13:19.920* :  period, really, rarely been out of power. So there's less risk associated with that. As you say,
*13:19.920- 13:26.360* :  you mentioned corruption scandal there, that's related to the LDP under a previous prime minister
*13:27.000- 13:31.700* :  suggestions that money was misappropriated. This is a chance for the party to kind of
*13:31.740- 13:39.420* :  a fresh start having election, giving the party a clear new mandate is a way to kind of look forward
*13:39.420- 13:45.980* :  rather than looking back. Mickey Bristow. In just under five weeks time, Kamala Harris will be hoping
*13:45.980- 13:51.700* :  to become America's first female president, but at the moment polling looks too close to call.
*13:51.700- 13:56.660* :  And if she does lose, she wouldn't be the first woman to suffer election defeat by Donald Trump.
*13:56.700- 14:02.520* :  The other was, of course, Hillary Clinton back in 2016, who's been speaking to the BBC's Amal
*14:02.520- 14:09.300* :  Rajan. What does she think? Is it stake this time around? I think the election outcome in the United
*14:09.300- 14:16.120* :  States will have repercussions far beyond our borders. It will also determine whether or not we
*14:16.120- 14:23.020* :  continue supporting Ukraine, whether we can get some kind of workable resolution in the Middle East
*14:23.180- 14:28.920* :  and so much else. And I say that because the two candidates have presented extremely
*14:29.020- 14:35.160* :  different agendas for where they want to take our country. And so I think it's really important
*14:35.280- 14:39.900* :  that people around the world understand that we know what the stakes are and we're doing everything
*14:39.900- 14:45.960* :  we can to elect Kamala Harris. Everyone can understand why you of all people would take what Donald
*14:45.960- 14:52.020* :  Trump says seriously, but do you give any credence to the idea that he did identify and articulate
*14:52.020- 14:58.200* :  perhaps sooner, perhaps better than some others, the legitimate grievances of many Americans who feel
*14:58.200- 15:03.420* :  that globalization has robbed them of their agency and of their future? You know, I think it's fair
*15:03.420- 15:09.360* :  to say that people support him for different reasons. And certainly for people who feel that they
*15:09.360- 15:14.900* :  are overlooked, they're unseen, the economy doesn't work for them, and they just want change. And
*15:14.900- 15:19.200* :  they are willing to risk the most dramatic kind of change. Although frankly, he didn't help them
*15:19.200- 15:23.780* :  very much the first time. So why they think he would this time is sort of a question mark.
*15:24.380- 15:30.420* :  But I think our problem is frankly, we are not the most effective messengers about what we see
*15:30.420- 15:36.600* :  and what we're trying to do to address these real and legitimate concerns that people have.
*15:37.180- 15:46.620* :  And I recognize and accept my share of the responsibility, but it is hard in a time when politicians
*15:46.780- 15:52.800* :  are expected to be more entertaining where social media demands that you be outrageous,
*15:52.800- 15:58.580* :  that you say something that breaks through to do the hard, boring work of actually getting
*15:58.580- 16:05.140* :  things done. You've known Joe Biden for decades. Now hindsight is a wonderful thing, but do you think
*16:05.680- 16:11.380* :  with the benefit of hindsight that he should have stepped down earlier? No, no, I do not. Why not?
*16:11.700- 16:16.400* :  I do not. We are now in a much different world because Joe Biden has been our president
*16:17.000- 16:22.440* :  in so many different ways, including the huge climate to investments that have been made,
*16:22.440- 16:28.100* :  advanced manufacturing so much else. And I was with him a week before that disastrous debate.
*16:28.100- 16:34.960* :  And I saw no reason why he should have stepped down. But once that debate happened,
*16:34.960- 16:41.060* :  he could not recover and he did the right thing. It was a selfless patriotic act for him
*16:41.060- 16:47.520* :  to step down and then endorse his vice president. And what would it mean to you if she went all the
*16:47.520- 16:52.860* :  way if Kamala Harris won and that she got the presidency that you got so close to? It would be
*16:52.860- 17:02.140* :  exhilarating. I mean, I am so excited by this opportunity for her to be president not only because
*17:02.140- 17:07.020* :  I know her and I believe she would be a good president, but it's imperative to defeat Donald Trump
*17:07.020- 17:13.340* :  to break the fever that he has caused in our political system and to try to help the Republican
*17:13.340- 17:19.960* :  Party become a party of principle again, not a party that basically follows him. Hillary Clinton.
*17:22.220- 17:27.300* :  Coming up. Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
*17:32.840- 17:39.320* :  We say farewell to the American singer, songwriter and actor Chris Christofferson, who's died aged 88.
*17:47.940- 17:53.360* :  It was more than 140 years ago when the UK became the birthplace of the world's first
*17:53.360- 17:58.660* :  coal-fired power plant, producing electricity for homes and factories across the land.
*17:58.660- 18:05.100* :  But today, its last remaining coal plant is closing for business. It is the first G7 country to
*18:05.100- 18:10.580* :  phase the fossil fuel out completely. So what are the reasons behind it? Justin Rolert is our
*18:10.580- 18:16.640* :  climate editor. Anxiety about coal really peaked back in the 50s when we had these terrible smogs.
*18:16.940- 18:20.780* :  So the work concerns about the quality of the air you could trace back at the beginning of the
*18:20.780- 18:26.900* :  end perhaps to there. But really what's happened in the last kind of few decades is in the 90s,
*18:26.980- 18:33.700* :  the North Sea in Britain started producing a lot of gas. That gas became cheaper and more
*18:33.700- 18:38.760* :  efficient than coal, happening at the same time as anxieties about acid rain across Europe,
*18:38.760- 18:43.440* :  which meant the EU had brought in regulations to control the emissions of coal plants,
*18:43.440- 18:47.580* :  which pushed up the price. So that was the first wave. They called it the dash to gas, which
*18:48.040- 18:52.700* :  squeezed a bit of coal out of the system. And then there was a second wave of reduction of coal use
*18:53.000- 18:57.260* :  when we began to roll out renewables in the UK, which has created the space, if you like,
*18:57.580- 19:01.800* :  that's allowed us now to close that last coal plant up in Nottinghamshire,
*19:02.180- 19:06.660* :  Ratcliffe, on saw. And allowed us to become the first of the G7 that there's a wealthy group of
*19:06.660- 19:11.780* :  nations to do so. How or other G7 nations doing on that front? Not as well. I mean, the other
*19:11.780- 19:17.380* :  thing that happened in the UK was our last big kind of bill out of new coal stations was in the 60s.
*19:17.840- 19:24.560* :  We never replaced those. Other countries, Germany, America, built out new coal stations 10,
*19:24.560- 19:29.000* :  15, 20 years ago. So they've still got a fleet of coal stations that are kind of, if you like,
*19:29.000- 19:32.700* :  inadvertent commas economically viable. As we're on their knees, they were at the end of their
*19:33.100- 19:37.560* :  life. So it was kind of relatively easy to close them down. So Germany, for example,
*19:37.560- 19:43.180* :  is not looking to end the use of coal to about 2035. So we are ahead of the path. There are other
*19:43.180- 19:47.840* :  European countries that have done it much smaller ones. Belgium, Sweden, Portugal, Austria have
*19:48.180- 19:52.580* :  ended coal. But yeah, we are the first. I mean, and the other interesting picture, not just
*19:52.580- 19:57.820* :  coal plants, but of course, the industrial revolution itself began here in the UK. The first
*19:57.820- 20:02.560* :  industrial nation now ending the use of coal is a very dramatic day. Just in road light.
*20:03.740- 20:09.560* :  The BBC has discovered McDonald's failed to stop the exploitation of nine men who'd been
*20:09.560- 20:15.440* :  trafficked to the UK from the Czech Republic and forced to work in a branch of the fast food
*20:15.440- 20:21.000* :  chain. The men were brought to the UK by members of a Czech criminal gang who faced trial
*20:21.000- 20:27.040* :  earlier this year. John Ironmunker reports. The victims worked in a Cambridgeer McDonald's
*20:27.040- 20:31.780* :  for more than four years. They were controlled by the gang with threats and violence and nearly all
*20:31.780- 20:36.800* :  their wages were stolen by the criminals who trafficked them to the UK. But neither McDonald's
*20:36.800- 20:41.360* :  nor the franchisees running the branch noticed the signs they were victims of modern slavery,
*20:41.880- 20:46.560* :  including that the wages for multiple people were being paid into the same bank accounts
*20:46.560- 20:51.840* :  and individuals were working up to a hundred hours a week. The company and its franchisee
*20:51.840- 20:56.960* :  say they've taken action to help detect potential risks in future and are committed to helping
*20:56.960- 21:02.540* :  every employee, the same gang forced other victims to work in a London factory supplying
*21:02.540- 21:07.100* :  own brand Pitterbreds to leading supermarkets. The British retail consortium,
*21:07.100- 21:12.020* :  speaking on behalf of the industry, says retailers do investigate and take swift action,
*21:12.300- 21:16.840* :  but it's important the retailers learn from cases like this. John Ironmunker
*21:17.760- 21:22.380* :  Tributes to being paid to the American singer, songwriter and actor Chris Christofferson,
*21:22.380- 21:28.140* :  who's died at the age of 88. He appeared in the hit movie A Star Is Born with Barbara Strisoned
*21:28.140- 21:31.760* :  and wrote songs like me and Bobby McGee and helped me make it through the night.
*21:32.340- 21:37.600* :  Michelle Hussein spoke to Joseph Hudeck from Rolling Stone magazine about Chris Christofferson's
*21:37.600- 21:43.980* :  legacy. When you talk about Chris Christofferson, yes, he's a singer, but above all else he was a
*21:43.980- 21:51.780* :  songwriter. Chris had this ability to just get into the heart of human emotion and human vulnerability
*21:51.900- 21:58.140* :  and particularly loneliness. There was something about the way that Chris could write about this idea
*21:59.400- 22:05.160* :  of not having anyone there to support you or any sense of structure that no one else could.
*22:05.380- 22:09.820* :  We were talking a bit about some of his songs and one of them that is really gets to the heart of
*22:09.820- 22:22.540* :  this is Sunday morning coming down. And Sunday morning coming down was most famously recorded
*22:22.540- 22:28.420* :  by Johnny Cash, but I would argue that Chris Christofferson's version is even more powerful.
*22:29.140- 22:35.840* :  Another of his songs that became very well known is me and Bobby McGee. Did he mind when his work
*22:36.020- 22:41.140* :  became much better known when it was covered by others? No, I don't think so at all. He didn't
*22:41.140- 22:46.780* :  hear Janice Joplin's version of me and Bobby McGee, which of course is the most famous one
*22:47.240- 22:52.720* :  until after Janice passed. And I believe he said he just walked all over Los Angeles just in
*22:52.720- 22:56.420* :  tears and he could barely listen to the song without breaking, you know, breaking up.
*23:09.620- 23:14.940* :  When you're a songwriter here in Nashville, the Nashville songwriter community is so based
*23:14.980- 23:20.500* :  around writing songs, not just for yourself, but for others, right? There's the community is
*23:20.900- 23:26.960* :  about sharing those songs and you don't particularly own a song per se. So if that song resonated
*23:26.960- 23:31.660* :  with someone else, Christofferson was more than happy to have them record it. Help me make it through
*23:31.660- 23:37.900* :  the night is another one of his maybe beautiful songs. Do you see him as a pioneer of Nashville?
*23:38.400- 23:43.020* :  Oh, without a doubt. Yeah, I mean, you know, we said it before, but Nashville is really a songwriting
*23:43.020- 23:48.320* :  town. There's a phrase that they use here. They say it all begins with a song and that's really what
*23:48.320- 23:53.500* :  is at the heart of this community. And that's why Christofferson is like the North Star in that
*23:53.500- 23:57.780* :  respect. I mean, you know, we'll talk about help me make it through the night. I mean, everyone
*23:57.780- 24:04.100* :  from Jerry Lee Lewis to Tina Turner and most famously Sammy Smith recorded that song. And she
*24:04.100- 24:10.920* :  had a number one with it, but Chris is just so hard to beat. Take the ribbon from your hand.
*24:14.220- 24:21.580* :  Shake it loose. Let it fall. Think about Christofferson's voices. He would even admit he was not a good singer.
*24:21.580- 24:26.720* :  You know, his voice was croaking. You know, when he uttered those sounds and the song like
*24:26.720- 24:30.620* :  help me make it through the night, you're really kind of worried that he may not see the morning light.
*24:30.620- 24:35.700* :  You know, that's what that song is about. One of his acting roles was in a star is born.
*24:44.140- 24:48.660* :  When Barbara, I think I saw this, she tweeted this today after, after Chris passed.
*24:48.660- 24:53.780* :  She said she first saw him perform at the Troubadour Club in Los Angeles. And right away,
*24:53.780- 24:58.880* :  she knew that he had what she wanted for the script that she was developing, which was the
*24:58.880- 25:04.500* :  star's born. He was on stage at the Troubadour strumming his guitar barefoot, very much the
*25:04.500- 25:09.460* :  fokie hippie kind of Troubadour at that time. But you know, I think acting was just another part
*25:09.460- 25:14.900* :  of who he was was just another facet of the man that is Chris Christofferson. I don't think it's
*25:14.900- 25:21.700* :  anything that he pursued any harder per se than he did songwriting. Joseph Houdak from Rolling Stone
*25:21.700- 25:27.720* :  magazine. But many people around the world, the UK is high on the list of places they'd like to
*25:27.720- 25:33.320* :  visit, although those used to the blazing heat might find the grey and wet weather a little
*25:33.320- 25:39.760* :  dreary if they stayed too long. But Holly Hennessy, a cruise enthusiast from Florida, was left without
*25:39.760- 25:46.060* :  a choice. She and her cat, called Captain, are finally now setting sail after four months stranded
*25:46.060- 25:52.220* :  in Belfast because of a problem with the ship. So is she sad or excited to be leaving? She's
*25:52.220- 25:57.920* :  been speaking to the BBC's Nick Robinson. You know, it's a little bit of both the ship people. We
*25:57.920- 26:04.460* :  all rented the pedal taverns yesterday. We had three of them. We had quite a group. And one of the
*26:04.460- 26:09.700* :  residents had made a beautiful soundtrack to go with it. And as we were passing City Hall,
*26:09.700- 26:18.920* :  that beautiful Belfast City Hall time to say goodbye came on the music and I cried. So I'm going
*26:18.920- 26:23.200* :  to be sad to say goodbye to Belfast, but we'll see you again, Clown. We'll get in the next
*26:23.200- 26:30.300* :  circumnavigation. You're not going to miss the weather, I suspect, Holly. Not at all. Not at all.
*26:30.720- 26:34.780* :  Lots of time with the umbrella spent in Belfast, but what are the happy memories there?
*26:35.240- 26:42.160* :  Well, part of the happy memory was surviving it. I actually wore out an umbrella. It lost its
*26:42.160- 26:50.980* :  waterproofing. It got so much use. I loved that my day trips, the Lord Mayor had us all the shipmates
*26:50.980- 26:58.280* :  for a reception at his chambers. It was wonderful. He invited the cat. Cat couldn't make it because
*26:58.280- 27:03.400* :  it was raining that day, but that's the kind of welcome we've had here in Belfast. Well,
*27:03.400- 27:08.920* :  make us jealous now because you live on this ship. This is your home. Where are you going now?
*27:09.500- 27:15.880* :  Well, our first port of call will be breasted, France, and then we will meander down the coast of
*27:15.880- 27:23.360* :  Europe and cross over the Atlantic to the Caribbean and then get back with our normally scheduled
*27:23.360- 27:28.560* :  itinerary. When your old friends in Florida ring up, say, should we go to Belfast? What will you say
*27:28.560- 27:32.920* :  to them? Get the weather forecast before you go. That was Holly Hennessy.
*27:34.660- 27:38.100* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the global news podcast
*27:38.220- 27:43.660* :  later. We're also planning a special edition of the podcast, marking one year since the Hamas
