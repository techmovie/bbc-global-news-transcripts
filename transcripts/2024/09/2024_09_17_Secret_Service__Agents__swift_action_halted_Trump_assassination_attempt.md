*00:45.200- 00:49.780* :  Mobile's legal team if big wireless companies are allowed to raise prices due to inflation.
*00:49.780- 00:53.840* :  They said yes. And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*00:53.840- 00:59.360* :  to your contracts, they said, what the f**k are you talking about? You insane Hollywood s**t?

*01:21.320- 01:23.560* :  I'm Andrew Peagin and the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:23.560- 01:29.240* :  the 17th of September. These are our main stories. The acting head of the US Secret Service says
*01:29.240- 01:34.500* :  swift action from agents help to fall the apparent attempt to assassinate Donald Trump on Sunday.
*01:34.500- 01:40.080* :  Mr. Trump has blamed the attack on rhetoric from his Democrat opponents. President Biden has said
*01:40.080- 01:45.000* :  there's no place for political violence in America. The Iranian president has promised to make
*01:45.000- 01:50.880* :  sure the morality police don't harass women. Also in this podcast,
*01:50.880- 01:57.720* :  there are no words to ease the loss endured by the families impacted by this tragic incident.
*01:57.720- 02:02.540* :  But we hope that this hearing will help shed light on the cause of the tragedy
*02:02.540- 02:08.100* :  and prevent anything like this from happening again. A public hearing begins into the submersible
*02:08.100- 02:13.020* :  which imploded on its way to find the Titanic. It hears the vessel had technical problems
*02:13.420- 02:14.800* :  during previous expeditions.
*02:18.220- 02:22.020* :  Now as we record this podcast, it's 30 hours since the US Secret Service,
*02:22.020- 02:27.320* :  one whole ahead of Donald Trump at his golf course in Florida spotted a rifle in the bushes
*02:27.320- 02:33.320* :  less than 500 meters from the man they were there to protect. On Monday, the suspect appeared at
*02:33.320- 02:38.900* :  West Palm Beach Courthouse charged with gun crimes. It's just the start of a legal process for
*02:38.900- 02:43.500* :  Ryan Ralph, a 58-year-old who lives in Hawaii, and appears to have been obsessed with the
*02:43.500- 02:49.220* :  war in Ukraine, even traveling there two years ago to try to take part. We learned a bit more
*02:49.220- 02:54.000* :  about the suspect at a news conference. The FBI said Ryan Ralph had previous weapons,
*02:54.000- 03:00.280* :  convictions, and was most recently questioned by police in 2019. But much of the focus was on whether
*03:00.280- 03:05.320* :  the Secret Service had protected Mr. Trump. The acting director Ronald Rose for the operation
*03:05.320- 03:09.740* :  had been a success. So here's the deal. When it comes to the Secret Service protection,
*03:09.740- 03:15.480* :  we provide the highest level. So what we did yesterday was exercise our emergency plan,
*03:15.480- 03:20.120* :  based on the number of tactical assets and the highest level of protection that we are providing.
*03:20.640- 03:23.460* :  And again, what I go back to is yesterday was an off-the-record movement,
*03:24.220- 03:29.160* :  off-the-record. And the president wasn't even really supposed to go there. It was not on his
*03:29.160- 03:33.100* :  official schedule. And so we put together a security plan and that security plan worked.
*03:33.760- 03:37.780* :  An off-America correspondent Peter Bose told me more about what we learned at the news conference.
*03:37.780- 03:42.920* :  Well, there was a lot about the former president's ongoing security. Ronald Rose,
*03:42.920- 03:46.060* :  Secret Service's acting director, who have just heard from, said,
*03:46.400- 03:52.640* :  law enforcement presence around Donald Trump's Florida home was now as intense as when he was
*03:52.640- 03:58.300* :  president. On what happened actually on Sunday, the Secret Service confirmed that the suspect,
*03:58.300- 04:05.280* :  Ryan Ruth, who was on the public side of the fence of the Trump golf course did not have a line
*04:05.280- 04:10.640* :  of sight on the former president. They previously said that he was about 500 yards away.
*04:10.640- 04:17.420* :  Nor did he fire any shots when he was confronted. Mr. Trump had been playing an unscheduled
*04:17.420- 04:23.600* :  round of golf and official say that the suspect, according to the FBI's analysis of cell phone
*04:23.600- 04:29.860* :  data, had been in the area for nearly 12 hours. And officials say they're still working to confirm
*04:29.900- 04:35.900* :  whether he acted alone. There's a pretty spirited defense of the Secret Service saying,
*04:35.900- 04:42.020* :  look, we had a plan. We executed the plan. It all worked. The suspect is in custody.
*04:42.020- 04:48.400* :  The former president is safe. Is the Secret Service under any real pressure from the American public
*04:48.400- 04:54.120* :  or establishment over this? Well, suddenly he painted a picture of the Secret Service being
*04:54.120- 05:00.800* :  under intense pressure underfunded for years with a mission to always get it right. Or as he put it
*05:01.040- 05:07.240* :  as zero fail mission. Now, Mr. Rose said the Secret Service Asians this past weekend did their jobs
*05:07.240- 05:13.280* :  as you say to the letter when they noticed a man poking a rifle through the bushes at Donald
*05:13.280- 05:18.740* :  Trump's golf course. To paraphrase, he and others insisted that their plan to protect the
*05:18.740- 05:23.880* :  president during what was this unscheduled visit when he said he wasn't supposed to be there.
*05:23.880- 05:27.780* :  It wasn't as if he was breaking any rules by being there. It's just that Donald Trump often
*05:27.780- 05:33.880* :  does that. He will occasionally have an unscheduled game of golf and that the plans in that moment
*05:33.880- 05:39.300* :  had absolutely worked. And let's talk about the political ramifications. Donald Trump's been
*05:39.300- 05:44.260* :  pretty quick to say, oh, it's the the Democrat rhetoric, causing people to dislike me, causing
*05:44.260- 05:51.600* :  people to take shots at me. Meantime, Biden and Harris have been keen to say no political violence
*05:51.600- 05:55.760* :  in America. And now that I understand the president has spoken to Mr. Trump.
*05:57.220- 06:01.300* :  Yes, that's what I understand as well that President Biden, this is according to a White House,
*06:01.740- 06:07.300* :  official has spoken with Donald Trump, conveyed his relief that he is safe,
*06:08.160- 06:13.940* :  the two apparently shared a cordial conversation and former President Trump expressed his
*06:13.940- 06:19.320* :  thanks for the call. But to your right, political ramifications are clearly going to be the issue,
*06:19.320- 06:24.540* :  at least one of the issues moving forward. And as you say, strong words from both Kamala Harris and
*06:24.760- 06:29.700* :  Joe Biden denouncing political violence, Mr. Trump has chosen to blame the current President
*06:29.700- 06:35.660* :  and his opponent in this election for what happens, saying that their rhetoric is causing me Donald
*06:35.660- 06:42.740* :  Trump to be shot at when I am the one he says who is going to save the country. Peter Boes with me
*06:42.740- 06:48.720* :  from Los Angeles. In our earlier podcast, we heard accounts of violence against women perpetrated
*06:48.720- 06:54.160* :  by Iran's morality police. Our report coincided with the second anniversary of the death of
*06:54.160- 06:59.320* :  Masa Amini, who died in police custody after she was arrested and according to eyewitnesses
*06:59.320- 07:06.100* :  beaten for wearing the mandatory hijab too loosely. Now Iran's President Masood Pezeshkin has
*07:06.100- 07:11.700* :  vowed to use his power to ensure the morality police don't bother women. The issue came up during
*07:11.700- 07:16.820* :  his first news conference since taking office in July when he replaced the ultra conservative
*07:16.820- 07:23.160* :  Ebrahim Reisi who died in a helicopter crash. I asked J.R. Gold, a BBC Persian, whether anything
*07:23.160- 07:28.260* :  is likely to change for Iranian women. One thing we have to understand are that the morality
*07:28.260- 07:32.820* :  police is not controlled by the president. In fact, is the police and the Supreme Leader
*07:33.220- 07:39.260* :  pretty much said the policies. But what he said today, President Pezeshkin, when asked by a
*07:40.040- 07:45.220* :  reporter, a female reporter, he said, until I get here, I have to go around a few blocks,
*07:45.220- 07:51.320* :  just avoid morality police. So I wouldn't be stopped and make it on time. And the president said,
*07:51.840- 07:58.140* :  I'm sorry you faced this and I assure you I will talk to them and follow up. Hopefully you wouldn't
*07:58.140- 08:05.480* :  experience something like this. But I think his tone is very reconcilatory and he tried to
*08:05.480- 08:10.860* :  pretty much be above every other group's conservative, ultra conservative and other people who
*08:10.860- 08:18.500* :  are demanding more freedom for women. But I don't think so far he has been able to achieve
*08:18.500- 08:24.000* :  something tangible to see underground. But what we see from the women themselves in a defined
*08:24.000- 08:30.480* :  act, we see them more and more everyday, removing headscarf and walking the street of Tehran
*08:30.480- 08:36.640* :  and other major cities around the country. Now this marks the second anniversary of Pasad Amini's death
*08:36.640- 08:44.600* :  in police custody, which is so widely reported at the time. How is that being marked by women in Iran?
*08:45.060- 08:52.960* :  Well, on Saturday, 34 women led by Nobel laureates in Nargis-Mahammadi, they went on hunger strike.
*08:53.240- 08:57.960* :  And actually a soundfile, we got from inside the notorious event president in Tehran,
*08:57.960- 09:04.820* :  they were chanting to remember Masa Amini and also chanting against Islamic Republic of Iran,
*09:04.820- 09:11.500* :  it was an act of define in captivity. So the election of a more moderate president in Iran is
*09:11.500- 09:16.240* :  reflective of public opinion from what you're saying. But what remains to be seen is how much
*09:16.240- 09:21.900* :  influence that has on the real power in Iran, the Supreme Leader. Everyone knows in Iran,
*09:21.980- 09:29.980* :  major policies, decisions lays in the hand of Supreme Leader and the powerful Iranian Revolution
*09:29.980- 09:36.460* :  guards. So the reality is this president with the promise of change, with the promise of
*09:36.460- 09:42.400* :  improving relations with the West, removing sanctions, because the sanctions are crippling
*09:42.400- 09:49.700* :  Iranian economy, and many people are struggling for their daily needs. So I think he promised it,
*09:49.740- 09:56.020* :  but so far what we have heard from President Posishyan is pretty much trying to unite those
*09:56.020- 10:03.940* :  element within the establishment. And we haven't seen much change underground. This is
*10:03.940- 10:10.660* :  remained to be seen whether this is his tactics to bring them on board, even including them
*10:10.660- 10:19.400* :  in his administrations, to make change in the country, or no, his entire aim is to keep the system
*10:19.400- 10:26.900* :  intact. J.R. Gold from BBC Persian with me. TikTok is in court in Washington to challenge a law
*10:27.140- 10:31.860* :  that'll see the social media outband in the US, unless it's Chinese owner sells it.
*10:32.320- 10:37.080* :  Let's get the story from Lily Jamali. President Joe Biden signed the divest or ban
*10:37.080- 10:42.520* :  ultimatum against TikTok into law this spring, after it passed with overwhelming bipartisan
*10:42.520- 10:47.880* :  support in the US Congress. Lawmakers said the social media platform could allow China's
*10:47.880- 10:54.520* :  government to access the data of its 170 million American users. TikTok has pushed back against
*10:54.520- 10:59.200* :  those claims. It's called the measure an extraordinary intrusion on free speech rights.
*10:59.600- 11:04.400* :  The parties in the case have asked for a ruling by early December. That would give the US Supreme
*11:04.400- 11:08.860* :  Court an opportunity to take the case up before a potential ban could take effect.
*11:09.720- 11:14.000* :  The US Coast Guard has begun hearings to investigate the implosion of the Titan's
*11:14.000- 11:18.720* :  submersible last year, which killed five people during a trip to see the wreck of the Titanic.
*11:18.860- 11:24.860* :  A days-long search operation was launched in June 2023. After the ocean gate vessel
*11:24.860- 11:30.020* :  failed to resurface from its voyage, more than 600 kilometres off the Canadian coast.
*11:30.020- 11:32.960* :  This report from our science editor Rebecca Morrell.
*11:33.300- 11:37.460* :  I would like to ask that everyone present please stand for a moment of silence and respect
*11:37.460- 11:39.920* :  to those persons who perish as a result of this casualty.
*11:41.300- 11:45.820* :  The hearing started with a moment to remember the five people who died on board ocean gates
*11:45.820- 11:51.280* :  Titan's subm last year. It imploded as it approached the wreck of the Titanic at the bottom of the
*11:51.280- 11:57.400* :  Atlantic Ocean. The US Coast Guard began by outlining serious problems experienced by the vessel
*11:57.400- 12:04.640* :  on expeditions carried out before the disaster. In 2021 and 2022, over the course of 13 dives to
*12:04.640- 12:11.760* :  the Titanic, it had 118 issues with equipment. These included the subs front dome falling off when
*12:11.760- 12:18.000* :  it was brought out of the sea. It's thrusters failing at 3,500 metres down. And on one dive,
*12:18.000- 12:22.300* :  its batteries died, leaving its passengers stuck inside for 27 hours.
*12:23.080- 12:27.260* :  Messages that were exchanged between the sub and its surface ship during the final dive
*12:27.260- 12:33.180* :  were also released. Titan began its dive at 917 in the morning, and while communications were
*12:33.180- 12:38.100* :  patchy, it sent messages about the progress of its descent. About an hour into the dive,
*12:38.100- 12:46.260* :  Titan messaged all good here. The last message was sent at 1047 at a depth of 3,346 metres.
*12:46.920- 12:50.260* :  After that, communication was lost. The sub had imploded.
*12:51.040- 12:55.000* :  The US Coast Guard said that there was nothing in the messages to suggest that the passengers
*12:55.000- 13:00.800* :  in the sub had any idea that anything was wrong. The hearings also heard for the first time from
*13:00.800- 13:05.240* :  representatives of ocean gates. Their lawyer, James Fretz, gave their condolences.
*13:05.560- 13:11.920* :  There are no words to ease the loss endured by their families impacted by the tragic incident.
*13:11.920- 13:16.800* :  But we hope that this hearing will help shed light on the cause of the tragedy
*13:17.380- 13:19.560* :  and prevent anything like this from happening again.
*13:19.980- 13:22.420* :  The hearings will continue over the next two weeks.
*13:23.040- 13:24.180* :  Rebecca Morrell reporting.
*13:26.480- 13:27.280* :  And still to come.
*13:27.900- 13:34.360* :  You've made remarkable progress, working with countries along migration routes as equals,
*13:34.360- 13:38.800* :  to address the drivers of migration of source and to tackle the gangs.
*13:38.800- 13:44.340* :  The British Prime Minister flies to Rome to get tips from the Italians about stopping migrant boats.
*13:53.100- 13:57.500* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. Recently, I asked Mintmobile's legal team if big wireless companies
*13:57.500- 14:00.880* :  are allowed to raise prices due to inflation. They said yes.
*14:01.300- 14:03.880* :  And then when I asked if raising prices technically violates those
*14:03.920- 14:07.660* :  to your contracts, they said what the f**k are you talking about?
*14:07.680- 14:09.240* :  You insane Hollywood s**t.
*14:09.540- 14:14.860* :  So to recap, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*14:52.120- 14:56.540* :  The former face of BBC News here in the UK, Hugh Edwards, has avoided jail
*14:57.020- 15:00.600* :  after admitting accessing indecent images of children as young as seven.
*15:01.240- 15:05.340* :  The 63-year-old was given a suspended sentence. You'll go to prison for six months
*15:05.340- 15:10.860* :  if you reoffend within two years. He also has to complete sex-evended prevention program.
*15:11.460- 15:16.080* :  The BBC said it was appalled by Edwards' crimes and he had betrayed its audiences.
*15:16.880- 15:20.520* :  Hugh Edwards was entrusted with leading the BBC's coverage of major events,
*15:20.580- 15:23.400* :  like the death of Queen Elizabeth two years ago.
*15:24.260- 15:28.200* :  A few moments ago Buckingham Palace announced the death of Her Majesty
*15:28.700- 15:33.920* :  Queen Elizabeth II. The palace has just issued this statement.
*15:34.840- 15:39.340* :  It says the Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon.
*15:40.380- 15:43.440* :  More from our culture and media editor Katie Razzle.
*15:43.760- 15:48.140* :  Well, Hugh Edwards has been convicted of making indecent images of children.
*15:48.360- 15:52.800* :  This is something that he pleaded guilty to in July, but the sentencing was today.
*15:52.860- 15:58.880* :  And when it comes to that term making, what actually happened was that he was sent
*15:58.920- 16:01.520* :  indecent images of child abuse, which he opened.
*16:01.560- 16:05.000* :  And by opening them, that, according to British law, means you have made them,
*16:05.040- 16:07.560* :  because it's almost like you've re-created them.
*16:07.900- 16:12.080* :  And the judge was very clear today that every time somebody opens these sorts of images,
*16:12.080- 16:15.520* :  they are retraumatising and re-victimising these young children.
*16:16.060- 16:18.300* :  So that's what the case was about.
*16:19.160- 16:21.500* :  What we learned today, you know, I've been covering this story for a year.
*16:21.500- 16:24.040* :  It's been unfolding in different ways for a year.
*16:24.040- 16:27.200* :  We've only known about this criminality since July.
*16:27.920- 16:32.160* :  But I have to say, even though it's prepared for this being about child abuse,
*16:33.060- 16:36.240* :  when you hear the details, the graphic details of what was happening to these children,
*16:36.320- 16:40.540* :  I mean, I did feel very shaken as I'm sure anybody did who heard them.
*16:40.880- 16:45.740* :  Two of the moving images involved children, a child as young as between seven and nine.
*16:45.900- 16:50.080* :  Most of the children were between 12 and 15 and all of them were male.
*16:51.080- 16:55.340* :  And Hugh Edwards probably isn't that well known outside this country.
*16:55.340- 17:01.120* :  But it's hard to exaggerate how integral to BBC News coverage he was, isn't it?
*17:01.320- 17:02.500* :  That is absolutely right.
*17:02.660- 17:07.100* :  I mean, the judge said today he's probably the most recognisable newsreader journalist
*17:07.100- 17:09.560* :  we have in this country, or at least he was.
*17:10.280- 17:12.900* :  So he was the trusted face of BBC News.
*17:12.900- 17:16.080* :  He presented the flagship programme called News at 10,
*17:16.080- 17:19.960* :  but he also was the person picked to announce the death of the Queen,
*17:19.960- 17:25.140* :  to really hold our hand through some very significant moments in British cultural identity
*17:25.140- 17:29.500* :  in the nation's moments, or whether that's the Queen's Prince Philip's funeral,
*17:29.500- 17:32.640* :  who was the husband of Queen Elizabeth or Royal Weddings.
*17:33.060- 17:34.400* :  So he really was.
*17:34.400- 17:39.580* :  The face of BBC News and the embodiment of BBC values, if you like, which means that this story
*17:39.920- 17:42.520* :  has just rocked everybody to their core.
*17:43.340- 17:47.860* :  And until surprisingly recently, he was paid large amounts of money by the BBC,
*17:47.860- 17:51.440* :  what about the reputational damage to the organisation?
*17:52.040- 17:56.300* :  Well, the chair of the BBC has accepted that the BBC has been damaged by this.
*17:56.300- 18:01.500* :  Clearly, the BBC is, they're right when they say Hugh Edwards is the villain of the piece.
*18:01.560- 18:06.560* :  It's not the BBC that have acted in this way, but there are these questions
*18:07.280- 18:09.040* :  around judgement by senior leaders.
*18:09.040- 18:13.320* :  So he was paid a vast amount of money, almost as much as the Director General,
*18:13.320- 18:15.320* :  who's the person at the very top of the BBC.
*18:16.080- 18:19.680* :  He got a pay rise of £40,000 in the last financial year.
*18:20.300- 18:25.260* :  And we now know that they continue to pay him around, so that would be about £200,000
*18:25.580- 18:29.700* :  between when he was arrested, and they knew about that arrest, and when he resigned.
*18:29.700- 18:30.920* :  So that was over five months.
*18:31.300- 18:33.440* :  And the BBC has asked him to pay that back.
*18:33.500- 18:37.820* :  And my understanding is there is no sign of that money as yet coming back from Hugh Edwards
*18:37.820- 18:39.280* :  if it is going to at all.
*18:39.620- 18:42.660* :  And so there are questions around why did they make this decision?
*18:42.940- 18:46.240* :  They knew that he had been arrested for very serious offences.
*18:46.860- 18:50.700* :  They were balancing their duty of care towards him as an employee.
*18:50.700- 18:54.020* :  There were no doubt had HR and lawyers in their ears saying,
*18:54.020- 18:55.360* :  you can't break this contract.
*18:55.640- 18:57.260* :  And they, of course, didn't know he was guilty.
*18:57.700- 19:00.720* :  And they certainly didn't know that the images were of such young children.
*19:01.120- 19:04.340* :  But they knew they were of the most serious category.
*19:04.340- 19:08.300* :  We heard in court today that Hugh Edwards was struggling with his mental health
*19:08.300- 19:09.320* :  and was a suicide risk.
*19:09.400- 19:12.140* :  And I'm sure that played in to their decision making.
*19:12.140- 19:17.020* :  But still, there are questions about why they weren't more robust at that point.
*19:17.880- 19:19.500* :  Katie Razzle with Paul Henley.
*19:19.920- 19:22.560* :  Two world leaders in very different political traditions,
*19:22.560- 19:26.540* :  met on Monday to talk about migration and asylum applications.
*19:26.700- 19:30.280* :  The issue is high on the agenda of the new British Prime Minister,
*19:30.280- 19:34.080* :  Keir Starmer, who flew to Rome to hold talks with his Italian counterpart,
*19:34.080- 19:37.900* :  Georgia Maloney, who's seen a big fall in arrivals since she took power.
*19:38.520- 19:42.320* :  At a news conference after the talks, Keir Starmer praised Mr Maloney's government,
*19:42.660- 19:45.320* :  saying it had made remarkable progress on migration.
*19:45.920- 19:47.860* :  Here's our home correspondent, Mark Loan.
*19:48.260- 19:50.880* :  They're not natural political bedfellows.
*19:50.880- 19:54.980* :  So Keir Starmer from the left, who began politics in the young socialists
*19:55.420- 19:59.180* :  and the right-winger, Georgia Maloney, who started her career in Italy's
*19:59.180- 20:00.680* :  youth neo-fascists.
*20:01.000- 20:03.840* :  But the Italian Prime Minister has moved away from the extreme
*20:03.840- 20:06.560* :  and now leads one of the EU's key members,
*20:06.980- 20:09.800* :  crucial to Sir Keir's aim of a reset with Europe.
*20:10.380- 20:12.100* :  Top of today's talks was migration.
*20:12.700- 20:15.800* :  Britain is struggling to stop small boats crossing the channel
*20:16.160- 20:18.300* :  with another eight migrants drowning this weekend.
*20:18.300- 20:22.060* :  Italy, the EU member that receives the highest number of migrants,
*20:22.060- 20:26.440* :  has witnessed a big fall in arrivals this year, which Sir Keir praised.
*20:26.440- 20:31.900* :  You've made remarkable progress, working with countries along migration routes
*20:31.900- 20:35.840* :  as equals to address the drivers of migration at source
*20:36.360- 20:37.580* :  and to tackle the gangs.
*20:37.580- 20:43.500* :  And as a result, irregular arrivals to Italy by sear down 60 percent
*20:44.220- 20:45.620* :  since 2022.
*20:46.560- 20:49.940* :  Central to that drop are deals struck with Tunisia and Libya,
*20:49.940- 20:55.860* :  the main points of departure, with Italy and the EU giving Tunisia more than 200 million euros.
*20:56.440- 20:59.660* :  But that's been heavily criticised, given that the Tunisian president
*20:59.660- 21:01.600* :  has been clamping down on democracy.
*21:02.240- 21:06.640* :  Some members of the European Parliament have warned the EU is bankrolling dictators.
*21:07.540- 21:10.500* :  Sir Keir also heard more from Miss Maloney about the centres
*21:10.500- 21:14.080* :  Italy is preparing to open in Albania to house asylum seekers.
*21:14.680- 21:18.220* :  Unlike with the Rwanda scheme, these camps will be run by Italy
*21:18.220- 21:20.920* :  and successful claimants would be given asylum here.
*21:20.920- 21:25.560* :  The Italian Prime Minister rejected criticism by human rights groups about the scheme.
*21:29.620- 21:34.200* :  I can see I don't know what human rights violations you're referring to, frankly speaking,
*21:34.720- 21:39.280* :  because I have explained at length that the jurisdiction of these centuries in Albania,
*21:39.780- 21:41.720* :  it's Italian and European jurisdiction.
*21:42.020- 21:47.060* :  So either you believe that European jurisdiction violates the human rights of migrants
*21:47.100- 21:49.500* :  or well, I don't know.
*21:50.200- 21:54.880* :  For now, Albania has said this deal is only with Italy, its closest ally in Europe.
*21:55.380- 21:58.780* :  But the new British government is said to be very interested in the model of
*21:58.780- 22:03.060* :  offshoring migration, as countries on the front line of this global challenge
*22:03.420- 22:07.180* :  look at new ways to solve a seemingly intractable problem.
*22:08.160- 22:14.100* :  In the HBO drama Succession, an elderly media mogul places four children off against each other
*22:14.500- 22:18.520* :  as each tries to prove themselves to be the rightful heir to the media empire.
*22:19.320- 22:24.880* :  A civil trial, which is just got underway, pits real-life media baron Rupert Murdoch and his elder son
*22:25.300- 22:26.700* :  against three of his other children.
*22:27.180- 22:30.980* :  And it's to decide the succession of the business if and when Murdoch retires.
*22:31.660- 22:34.540* :  So what is Mr Murdoch senior trying to achieve?
*22:34.920- 22:38.060* :  Sarah Ellison is media correspondent for the Washington Post.
*22:38.640- 22:46.380* :  He's attempting to change the terms of the trust that was set up when he and his second wife,
*22:46.780- 22:50.500* :  Anna Murdoch divorced many years ago and the terms of that divorce
*22:51.640- 22:57.300* :  were that she was giving up a tremendous amount of money in order to ensure that her three children
*22:57.760- 23:01.880* :  and prudence, the eldest child of Rupert Murdoch's first marriage,
*23:02.400- 23:06.800* :  would have equal control over the family trust after Rupert died.
*23:07.540- 23:13.260* :  And what Rupert Murdoch is attempting to do is because there has been so much bad blood
*23:13.260- 23:20.040* :  between his children, he is attempting to cement control going into the future of his
*23:20.040- 23:25.140* :  media empire with one of his children, Lachlan Murdoch, his eldest son,
*23:25.200- 23:28.380* :  and he's trying to strip the control away from the other three children.
*23:28.540- 23:32.280* :  So it really is like an episode of succession then isn't it?
*23:32.280- 23:37.560* :  The TV program sounds like it. I mean you say there's been bad blood between the siblings
*23:37.560- 23:41.860* :  but doesn't Mr Murdoch himself have a role in that?
*23:41.860- 23:46.180* :  He's been sort of pitting them against each other hasn't he, all these decades?
*23:46.820- 23:52.280* :  Absolutely, he has had his children compete against one another for his affection
*23:52.280- 23:59.660* :  for the prize of running the media empire. So while he has always said he wanted one of his children
*23:59.660- 24:06.200* :  to succeed him, running his company, he never said which one exactly and he always made it a bit
*24:06.200- 24:11.700* :  of a prize. So they've all gone through their time in the barrel. Things really came to a head
*24:12.180- 24:17.860* :  during the phone hacking crisis. That was when James was running the European and Asian parts of
*24:18.440- 24:23.920* :  the Murdoch Empire and there was a terrible phone hacking crisis and then Rupert and Lachlan
*24:23.920- 24:30.420* :  and Elizabeth all came in to sort of undercut James. That was sort of the beginning of when James
*24:30.420- 24:35.920* :  and Lachlan really felt like they were rivals of one another. I mean they had this the entire
*24:35.920- 24:38.940* :  time that they were growing up but that was the moment when it really came to a head.
*24:39.160- 24:44.720* :  So this is about voting control. It's not actually about money and profit is it? It's about the
*24:44.720- 24:51.260* :  power and I guess the direction of the Murdoch empire is that really what it boils down to.
*24:51.640- 24:58.620* :  Well that's exactly what it's about in fact and it is essentially what Rupert is most worried
*24:58.620- 25:03.940* :  about and Lachlan, you know James and Lachlan and Rupert are not speaking to each other anymore.
*25:04.340- 25:10.920* :  So James has sort of when he left the company he critiqued the coverage in the Murdoch properties
*25:10.920- 25:15.680* :  the way they were covering climate change. He was upset with Fox News in the United States for
*25:15.680- 25:22.360* :  the way that it had initially pushed election denial here after Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden
*25:22.360- 25:27.440* :  and what's happening now is that Rupert is essentially saying that the only way that he can change
*25:27.440- 25:32.420* :  the terms of the trust is if he can convince the court that it is in the financial benefit of his
*25:32.420- 25:38.620* :  hairs to have this control under Lachlan and what he is saying and what he is arguing is that
*25:38.900- 25:44.600* :  the future of the Murdoch company really has to be under a conservative owner and that is
*25:44.600- 25:51.200* :  Lachlan Murdoch. Sarah Ellison with Rebecca Kesby. One of the original members of the Jackson 5,
*25:51.200- 25:57.340* :  Tito Jackson has died at the age of 17. Along with his brothers, Jermaine, Jackie, Marlon and Michael,
*25:57.880- 26:02.200* :  he enjoyed huge success from the late 1960s with songs like ABC,
*26:02.200- 26:06.800* :  I want you back and I'll be there. He spoke to the BBC in 2017.
*26:06.800- 26:13.520* :  I've enjoyed what I do. I have fun at what I do. I call it the best job in the world and some
*26:13.520- 26:18.300* :  people look at show business and they say show business. Who wants to be an entertainer?
*26:18.300- 26:23.780* :  You know, there's drugs, there's booze, there's parties and this and that.
*26:24.220- 26:29.740* :  But a lot of people find this hard to believe but the Jackson 5 has never been to their own
*26:29.740- 26:34.980* :  after party or never. So we didn't do the alcohol scene and all that whole thing.
*26:35.660- 26:41.440* :  That's one of the reasons why we're still capable of doing what we do today and still enjoy it
*26:41.700- 26:47.400* :  and do it in a healthy way. Our entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson looks back at Tito
*26:47.400- 26:54.540* :  Jackson's life. The Jackson 5 were a pop phenomenon.
*26:57.680- 27:01.380* :  Their first four hit singles all made it to number one in the US.
*27:05.180- 27:07.240* :  The first group ever to achieve the feat.
*27:11.040- 27:15.260* :  And Tito Jackson was there from the start first in the early 60s with his brothers,
*27:15.260- 27:20.700* :  Jameen and Jackie and then joined by Marlon and Michael. They supported the likes of James Brown
*27:20.700- 27:26.420* :  and the Islay Brothers before leaving Indiana to sign from Motown, relocating to Los Angeles.
*27:30.600- 27:35.720* :  Tito was only 16 when the group made it big and despite being an accomplished guitarist,
*27:35.720- 27:40.520* :  Motown didn't trust him to play on the records using session musicians instead.
*27:41.040- 27:42.900* :  This only changed when they quit the label.
*27:48.300- 27:54.080* :  After 1984's victory tour, the biggest in history at the time, Michael Jackson left for good.
*27:54.080- 28:00.140* :  But despite breaks and lineup changes, Tito continued to play live with different incarnations
*28:00.140- 28:06.440* :  of the Jackson's right up until the end, appearing just over a week ago at the Boogie Town festival
*28:06.700- 28:07.940* :  in Walton on Thames.
*28:14.740- 28:17.120* :  Our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson.
