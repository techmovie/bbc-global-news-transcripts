*01:31.660- 01:34.640* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:36.100- 01:40.900* :  I'm Nick Barnes, and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday, the 5th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:41.620- 01:47.880* :  Calls for action on violence against women after a Ugandan Olympic athlete was set on fire and
*01:47.880- 01:54.840* :  killed allegedly by her former partner. China promises over 50 billion dollars in loans to African
*01:54.840- 02:00.480* :  nations. Emmanuel Macron chooses Michel Barnier to be France's new prime minister.
*02:02.960- 02:09.400* :  Also in this podcast, sometimes they took the people and then they bring some barber and then
*02:09.400- 02:15.720* :  they shaved the birds directly on the police station. The country where the police are on the
*02:15.720- 02:23.140* :  lookout for men with beards. We start in East Africa.
*02:29.140- 02:34.700* :  She was a good child. Very polite. She had no issues at all. I just don't know.
*02:35.440- 02:41.620* :  That is the simple tribute from the grieving mother of the Ugandan athlete, Rebecca Cheptegay.
*02:42.280- 02:47.020* :  On Sunday, Rebecca had just come home from church where she was living in Northwestern Kenya
*02:47.620- 02:51.780* :  when she was doused in petrol and set on fire, allegedly by a former boyfriend.
*02:51.780- 02:57.760* :  She suffered burns to more than 70% of her body and the day she died. The head of Uganda's
*02:57.760- 03:03.560* :  Olympic Committee called her killing a cowardly and senseless act that has led to the loss of a great
*03:03.560- 03:10.880* :  athlete. Her legacy will continue to endure. Our reporter Celestine Karoney in Nairobi told me more
*03:10.880- 03:15.360* :  about her and the wider problem of violence against women in Kenya and beyond.
*03:41.340- 03:45.520* :  This was a case that was in front of the authorities and had not been resolved yet.
*03:45.960- 03:50.540* :  On Sunday, when she came back home from church with her two children, she was doused with
*03:50.540- 03:56.060* :  petrol and set on fire and her alleged ataka also suffered burns. Both of them are taken to
*03:56.060- 04:01.760* :  hospital in the ICU with serious burns. This morning, we received the news that Cheptegay had
*04:01.760- 04:07.160* :  passed on. Cheptegay did compete for Uganda not just at this year's Olympics, but also last
*04:07.160- 04:12.580* :  year at the World Championships. She is known to be a winner in the world, a mountain and a trail
*04:12.580- 04:19.140* :  running where she won't go back in 2022. Extraordinary talented athlete. There are an awful lot of
*04:19.140- 04:25.520* :  violence against women in Kenya. Specifically, there's worry about an increasing amount of violence
*04:25.520- 04:30.700* :  against female athletes there, isn't there? Yes, there is a concern because this case about
*04:30.700- 04:34.640* :  Cheptegay has really struck a chord within Kenyan Athletics community because two years ago,
*04:35.000- 04:40.980* :  two athletes Agnestyrop who is Kenyan abiding talent and Damaris Mutua Kenyan born by rainy
*04:40.980- 04:47.000* :  were murdered at the hands of their intimate partners according to police. Agnestyrop's husband
*04:47.000- 04:52.160* :  is currently in court facing a mother charge while Damaris Mutua's boyfriend is still
*04:52.160- 04:56.640* :  at large, police are looking for him. And so there's a lot of concern around violence against
*04:56.640- 05:02.140* :  athletes. And Athletics Kenyan yesterday spoke to the BBC about safeguarding policies that they're
*05:02.140- 05:07.920* :  introducing are the training they're doing now around athletes and around female athletes specifically
*05:07.960- 05:13.900* :  on how to be safe, how to ensure safe reporting especially because we hear that a lot of these
*05:13.900- 05:18.860* :  athletes or a lot of women who are suffering gender-based violence do not make reports with the
*05:18.860- 05:25.620* :  authorities out of fear, out of shame or lack of trust in the public system. And so there's a lot of
*05:25.620- 05:30.160* :  training that Athletics Kenyan say they're trying to do to raise awareness on this issue.
*05:30.520- 05:34.840* :  Nationally there is an issue really around gender-based violence as well because last year
*05:35.260- 05:41.740* :  a report from the demographic health survey showed that 40% of women have suffered a form of
*05:41.740- 05:47.420* :  violence with a physical or sexual. So it is a concerning issue in this country, gender-based
*05:47.420- 05:52.860* :  violence. And a concern too that perhaps some men across can you do not take this as a serious
*05:52.860- 05:58.320* :  issue? Yes, yes, absolutely. There's that concern as well yesterday via Athletics Kenyan
*05:58.320- 06:04.800* :  president, retired general, Tuay told me that some of the challenges they face is that they hear
*06:04.960- 06:09.720* :  there's a lot of cultural challenges because of most of these athletes who say, oh, you know,
*06:09.720- 06:14.680* :  we've been raised like this. This is, you know, the man takes charge. And a lot of these issues he
*06:14.820- 06:21.220* :  said really also stem from the ownership of property. Most of these women who maybe are competing
*06:21.220- 06:25.900* :  and their property is not in their names and things like that, yet they're the ones who earn
*06:25.900- 06:30.500* :  the money. So they've really said there's a lot of cultural education that needs to be done
*06:30.500- 06:36.540* :  around that. They'll sell us in Corona. China's relations with America and much of Europe
*06:36.540- 06:43.940* :  are at a low-Eb over Taiwan, human rights, and economic strains as well. So Beijing is continuing
*06:43.940- 06:49.140* :  to look south for friends and clients. And the south has come to Beijing this week
*06:49.140- 06:54.680* :  in the form of 50 African leaders for a summit, the first such face-to-face meeting since the start
*06:54.680- 06:59.680* :  of the coronavirus pandemic to strengthen ties. And what better way to strengthen them than
*06:59.680- 07:04.940* :  with the promise of cash? China's president Xi Jinping has pledged over 50 billion dollars
*07:04.940- 07:11.680* :  in new loans for Africa over the next three years. China Africa relations are now at their
*07:11.680- 07:17.740* :  best period in history. Looking to the future, I propose raising China's bilateral relations
*07:17.740- 07:23.640* :  with all African countries that have diplomatic ties to the level of strategic relationships.
*07:25.740- 07:29.880* :  So what does he mean by that? I spoke to our correspondent in Beijing, Nora Bicca.
*07:30.480- 07:35.420* :  What he's meaning is he wants China to work together with African nations
*07:36.260- 07:43.120* :  to and cleave themselves away from Western influence. This is about China trying to raise its
*07:43.120- 07:50.080* :  influence in a continent that is rich in minerals, that is rich in oil. And when the African
*07:50.080- 07:56.700* :  nations are developing, China wants them to look towards Beijing, not elsewhere, not the United
*07:56.700- 08:03.240* :  States, not the European Union and certainly not the likes of the UK. They want African nations
*08:03.240- 08:08.480* :  to look towards China. Now China has a very long deep relationship with African nations. However,
*08:08.480- 08:14.320* :  in recent years, the continent has become quite a source of competition. And I think what China's
*08:14.320- 08:20.440* :  beginning to do, certainly pre-pandemic, was they were building a major infrastructure projects.
*08:20.440- 08:25.700* :  You're looking at roads, railways, ports, right across different nations across Africa.
*08:26.240- 08:33.460* :  But during the pandemic years, as China's economy begins to falter, those investments also
*08:34.040- 08:40.360* :  began to falter. And the money tap almost on some of them started to switch off, which meant
*08:40.360- 08:46.340* :  that many African nations will it will hang on a second. Can we trust China? This three-day summit,
*08:46.340- 08:52.380* :  which is being billed in Chinese media, as the most important diplomatic event of the year,
*08:52.380- 08:59.700* :  it is the biggest in quite a long time. This diplomatic event is aimed at shoring up confidence.
*09:00.180- 09:04.660* :  And Laura, what stood out for me and probably will have stood out for Western diplomats is when
*09:04.660- 09:11.020* :  he talked about sending military advisers to? Yeah, and he's pledged about $280 million in aid
*09:11.020- 09:15.740* :  in military aid, which is he said it's going to be split evenly between military and food
*09:15.740- 09:20.980* :  assistance. But I think that is the largest amount in military aid that China has a marked for
*09:20.980- 09:28.760* :  this purpose. So I think many people will see that as Beijing looking at the security of the
*09:28.760- 09:33.540* :  relationship between Beijing and its partners in Africa, looking to make sure that its investments
*09:33.540- 09:39.960* :  are secure along the continent. Laura Bicca in Beijing. So how is this being viewed by African
*09:39.960- 09:46.040* :  leaders? Our correspondent Barbara Plerashe is in Nairobi. China has been a very important source of
*09:46.040- 09:51.980* :  financing, as Laura was saying. They would want to see that continue, but also there is the issue
*09:51.980- 09:58.160* :  of the death that that builds up. Now, China has been a major contributor to Africa's death binge,
*09:58.580- 10:04.000* :  not the only one, but it is the top bilateral lender. And it has been reluctant to restructure
*10:04.000- 10:09.080* :  those deaths in the way that some major creditor nations and the IMF might have done. So debt
*10:09.080- 10:15.120* :  restructuring will be one, but they will also be looking still to get that kind of investment that
*10:15.120- 10:20.760* :  they need for those infrastructure projects, railways, roads, bridges, which are particularly
*10:20.760- 10:25.240* :  important to them, especially as they're trying to organize a continental free trade zone.
*10:25.660- 10:29.780* :  And if you look at African leaders, and I'm generalizing here, but I think they have a more
*10:30.180- 10:35.620* :  transactional view of how they relate to allies, and they're able to do that because they're
*10:35.620- 10:41.980* :  being courted more given the resources, given the geopolitical competition. So they would see China
*10:41.980- 10:47.900* :  as a bilateral lender, as a top business partner of choice, but they would also, many of them,
*10:47.900- 10:53.000* :  not all of them would speak to the Americans as well to see what they get out of their relationship.
*10:53.000- 10:57.300* :  And so you see a number of African leaders. I would say Kenya's president being one of them who
*10:57.300- 11:02.700* :  do have relations, good relations with both and do try to make the most of those relations.
*11:03.220- 11:09.180* :  Barbara Pledascha in Nairobi there. A vigil has been held in the French city of Calais
*11:09.300- 11:15.220* :  in tribute to the people who lost their lives as they tried to reach the UK in a small inflatable boat.
*11:15.900- 11:21.460* :  Six children and a pregnant woman were among 12 who died on Tuesday after their boat sank off
*11:21.460- 11:26.740* :  the French coast. This latest incident, one of the deadliest of its kind in months, has raised
*11:26.740- 11:32.540* :  more questions about the tactics used by people smugglers and the police fighting them. Our corresponded
*11:32.540- 11:39.360* :  in France, Andrew Harding attended the vigil in Calais. The mood here is somber. There is a lot of
*11:39.360- 11:46.620* :  anger though directed towards the French security forces. The militarization that people fear
*11:47.140- 11:53.720* :  is taking place along the coastline. But also towards the authorities in Britain, calls for people
*11:53.720- 12:01.540* :  to make it easier for migrants to cross safely and legally to the UK. One of those attending this
*12:01.540- 12:10.480* :  vigil is Danny Patu who works for a local charity supporting migrants here. All these extra security
*12:10.480- 12:17.120* :  forces active on our coastline, the burgues and drones and helicopters, all this is achieving is
*12:17.120- 12:23.340* :  more death. It is provoking those migrants who want to cross to take greater risks. I'm furious.
*12:23.980- 12:27.280* :  These people are trapped here. They're not welcome anywhere. It's beautiful.
*12:28.600- 12:34.700* :  Further down the coast, fishermen dragging boxes of fresh welks onto the key side, a good haul.
*12:35.120- 12:42.340* :  But the mood here is subdued too. On Tuesday, Captain Gaiton Bayet and his crew came across the
*12:42.340- 12:48.300* :  smugglers boat minutes after it had capsized and they were soon dragging dead bodies from the water.
*12:52.000- 12:55.040* :  It shouldn't have happened. So who is to blame I ask?
*12:58.140- 13:03.240* :  Bayet frowns and shrugs. There was nothing left of the boat when we arrived, he continues.
*13:03.240- 13:10.920* :  There were obviously far too many people on board. For now, police here in France have finished
*13:10.920- 13:16.760* :  interviewing survivors, but the investigation, the search for the ring leaders in the smuggling
*13:16.760- 13:24.380* :  networks continues. And so does this. A municipal bulldozer clearing away another
*13:24.380- 13:31.900* :  informal migrant camp, tents and mattresses dumped in a skip. Police on standby in case of trouble.
*13:32.260- 13:38.200* :  But this particular migrant camp was where the Eritreans who drowned on Tuesday were living.
*13:38.860- 13:42.720* :  The timing of its destruction seems unfortunate at best.
*13:48.620- 13:52.980* :  With the help of a translator listening on a phone line, I speak to a young Eritrean man,
*13:52.980- 13:58.720* :  who tells me he knew some of those who died, but who still hasn't given up on his own dream of
*13:58.720- 14:01.920* :  reaching the UK. Thank you. What did he say, please?
*14:13.360- 14:19.840* :  So what next for this decade's long ever evolving crisis? Olivier Barbera is the mayor of a
*14:19.840- 14:23.980* :  resort town called Le Portel, where the bodies were brought ashore this week.
*14:29.340- 14:33.540* :  You can see the English coast from here, and you can imagine how these migrants don't want to stay
*14:33.540- 14:38.140* :  in France. Some have traveled across Europe on food. They just want to get to a country where
*14:38.140- 14:42.340* :  they are family, where they speak the language, and where they know they can find work easily.
*14:42.860- 14:47.540* :  Here in France, people still welcome the migrants with compassionate kindness, but it is
*14:47.540- 14:56.860* :  goes on, I think, attitudes will change. My sense is that they're changing already,
*14:56.860- 15:00.680* :  that people are losing patience with the authorities on both sides of the channel,
*15:00.940- 15:06.740* :  skeptical that we are anywhere close to a comprehensive solution to stop the small boats
*15:06.780- 15:13.160* :  and smuggling gangs, and to end the misery that now clings to this coastline like a sea fog.
*15:14.820- 15:15.900* :  Adry Harding Reporting
*15:16.860- 15:23.820* :  It was a highly successful Olympic Games in Paris for Uzbekistan, finishing 13th in the world.
*15:23.820- 15:30.400* :  It's highest ranking since independence back in 1991, but one gold medalist speaking anonymously
*15:30.400- 15:35.760* :  says he and the other athletes were forced to get rid of their beards before a video call
*15:35.760- 15:40.820* :  with the president, and it seems the government is keen to make sure all men take on a clean
*15:40.820- 15:47.700* :  shave and look. Emilio Cricio has been speaking to the BBC's Uzbek services, Shodiya Saif.
*15:48.360- 15:56.740* :  Formerly, there is no law which has been having a bird, but the police go around the mosques
*15:56.880- 16:03.200* :  and around the streets, and they will catch the people with the bird, and they will ask for the
*16:03.200- 16:10.940* :  politely shave your bird, and if they refuse, they will say that we will jail you for the 15 days,
*16:11.140- 16:17.100* :  and sometimes they took the people to the police station, and then they bring some barber,
*16:17.100- 16:21.960* :  and then they shaved the birds directly on the police station.
*16:22.260- 16:28.560* :  In many Islamic countries, it's quite common for men to wear beards, and Uzbekistan is a majority
*16:28.560- 16:33.300* :  Muslim country, so it begs the question, why is this happening?
*16:33.620- 16:42.640* :  You know, there's around 47 million people in Uzbekistan, and more than 90% Muslim, so people try
*16:42.640- 16:50.520* :  to have a bird, but the government is trying to take a balance with Islamism and secular state,
*16:51.080- 16:57.000* :  so they want to keep more secular. It's not only taking the bird issue here,
*16:57.440- 17:01.200* :  right now they are against the Nikhabs.
*17:01.520- 17:04.540* :  And Nikhabs, the long gown that just shows the eyes.
*17:04.800- 17:12.360* :  Yeah, yeah, just shows the eyes, so recently they find one lady, because she has a medical mask
*17:12.360- 17:19.340* :  on her face, and scarf on her head. Meanwhile, in neighboring Afghanistan, the Taliban government
*17:19.340- 17:26.200* :  is enforcing quite strict virtue laws, which reportedly include the mandatory wearing of beards.
*17:26.500- 17:31.560* :  Is that influencing the enforcement of secularist laws in Uzbekistan?
*17:31.940- 17:36.540* :  I think, yeah, it's a good point, because on the social media, also the people mentioning that,
*17:36.660- 17:42.600* :  and because there's a one river, which divides the country, the Amudaria, and they said the other
*17:42.600- 17:49.380* :  side of the Amudaria river, people forced to have a bird, but the other side is vice versa.
*17:50.140- 17:54.820* :  So, I think it also plays kind of role, because, you know,
*17:55.080- 18:00.600* :  government is afraid that one day, Uzbekistan also become a, you know, Islamic country.
*18:03.580- 18:05.380* :  Still to come on this podcast?
*18:10.380- 18:15.360* :  This is our land, a land of peace, the plentiful.
*18:15.840- 18:20.300* :  We look at the O'William plans for a library filled with copies of just one book.
*18:28.460- 18:33.120* :  Good taste is easy to spot, but hard to pin down. You know it when you see it,
*18:33.320- 18:37.940* :  and in today's culture, there's no greater signifier of taste than the car you drive.
*18:38.360- 18:41.500* :  You want something is sophisticated, but not stodgy,
*18:41.800- 18:46.600* :  daring, yet classic, approachable, but with an air of opulence.
*18:46.760- 18:51.280* :  That's where the Range Rover evoke comes in. The reductive exterior is an elegant

*19:39.140- 19:43.600* :  The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has named the veteran conservative politician,
*19:43.640- 19:49.480* :  Michel Barnier, as prime minister two months after France's snap elections ended in political
*19:49.480- 19:54.080* :  deadlock. He's been asked to form a new government in an attempt to end weeks of failed
*19:54.080- 19:58.980* :  negotiations between rival parties. Our Paris correspondent, Hugh Scofield, tell me more about the
*19:58.980- 20:03.280* :  new French PM. Michel Barnier will be well-known to people in Britain,
*20:03.340- 20:07.600* :  because he was, of course, the voice of the EU throughout the long Brexit negotiations.
*20:07.740- 20:13.900* :  That's how he won his reputation there. But, of course, long before that, he had a pass in France
*20:13.900- 20:19.100* :  and in Europe. He was first a minister back in 93 under the cohabitation government,
*20:19.340- 20:22.960* :  when Metron was president. And he served under Shirok after that. He was foreign affairs minister
*20:23.860- 20:28.720* :  for a period in the early 2000s, and then went to Europe. And his sort of flag was very much associated
*20:28.720- 20:33.160* :  with Europe after that, becoming the commissioner and then the negotiator. And after the Brexit
*20:33.160- 20:38.180* :  happened, he's kind of gone into kind of conference land. He sort of disappeared off the map,
*20:38.180- 20:43.900* :  just doing the tour of the world, talking about the great good and good and important matters.
*20:44.480- 20:48.540* :  And learning lots of money, I'm no doubt. And now he's been resuscitated because he's
*20:48.640- 20:53.660* :  going to fix the bill as someone who could rescue Macron from the whole that he's dug himself.
*20:54.200- 20:59.560* :  That's because he is someone who is not going to completely dismantle the legacy of Macron's
*20:59.560- 21:03.560* :  first years. For example, he's someone on the right who will be in favor of the key thing,
*21:03.560- 21:08.620* :  in particular, that the pension reform. And he's someone who, and the face of it, is not going to
*21:08.620- 21:14.260* :  automatically bring a trigger at the rejection of the far right. Now, the point about all this is
*21:14.260- 21:18.720* :  that the parliament is completely divided into different blocks. And only as a prime minister
*21:18.720- 21:22.640* :  who can command some support from either the far right or the left is going to survive.
*21:22.640- 21:27.780* :  And, you know, right now it looks like, you know, Barney will have the support of the centre
*21:27.780- 21:33.080* :  and maybe the tolerance of the far right for a bit. But he's hanging on a on a thread.
*21:33.540- 21:37.400* :  The sort of damically hangs over any point. I mean, it's certainly hangs over, he said too.
*21:37.620- 21:40.780* :  Yeah, he's definitely not going to be supported by the left and the far left.
*21:40.780- 21:46.080* :  A Jean-Luc Milachon from the the hard left, France, unbound party. Part of the biggest
*21:46.080- 21:50.120* :  alliance, if you like, from the left, a new popular front has saying that we're going to call for
*21:50.120- 21:54.760* :  street protests. His appointment would be proof that the election has been stolen from the left.
*21:55.020- 21:57.920* :  But you think possibly he might get the supporter of the right.
*21:58.240- 22:01.120* :  Well, I don't think it's the support of the hard right, there's sort of populist right.
*22:01.540- 22:05.960* :  But, you know, they're all playing games. Marine Le Pen's party, you know, obviously,
*22:06.340- 22:09.120* :  doesn't like him for all sorts of reasons, not least because he's very European,
*22:09.120- 22:14.540* :  also because he certainly doesn't want to repeal the pensions reforms, which are, you know,
*22:14.540- 22:19.980* :  Macron's flagship in which the hard right, the populist's hate. But they don't hate him as
*22:19.980- 22:24.360* :  viscerally as some other people on the right and they might keep him in power for a bit by not voting
*22:24.360- 22:28.960* :  against him, simply to seem twisty and agony, maybe, but just to show that they're bosses.
*22:28.960- 22:33.280* :  So he may stay in power, but suddenly the left absolutely hates him and, well,
*22:33.280- 22:36.620* :  he's definitely stands for, shall we say, because they say they won the election.
*22:37.020- 22:40.260* :  It's been stolen from them and, you know, the establishment, the establishment right
*22:40.260- 22:46.760* :  is a returning one of its own with, even worse, the support and connivance of the hard right of
*22:46.760- 22:52.560* :  the Marine Le Pen is. Husekofield, when the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken,
*22:52.560- 22:57.680* :  visits Haiti today, it will not be to congratulate the authorities on a mission accomplished.
*22:57.680- 23:03.960* :  Haiti has been devastated by gang violence, which has made many parts of the capital no-go areas.
*23:04.380- 23:09.060* :  And now the Haitian government has extended a state of emergency to the whole country.
*23:09.440- 23:13.880* :  It comes after protesters stormed and vandalized the power plant, leaving more than a million
*23:13.880- 23:20.100* :  people without electricity. Around 400 Kenyan peacekeepers were sent to Haiti back in June,
*23:20.160- 23:23.780* :  but they've yet to make a big impact on the levels of insecurity.
*23:24.400- 23:26.880* :  Matthias Pierre is a former Haitian minister.
*23:27.620- 23:34.920* :  Certainly I was always concerned there would be no great improvement. I think more equipment
*23:35.620- 23:43.100* :  like armored vehicle and ammunition came to the country to support the national police
*23:43.540- 23:50.580* :  and the 500 Kenyans to fight the gangs, but the lack of strategy is the biggest issue.
*23:50.740- 23:56.700* :  Don't see any strategy from the Haitian government to put in place the right people
*23:57.240- 24:00.260* :  in the position to develop a strategy to fight the gangs.
*24:00.760- 24:04.720* :  I have more about the new state of emergency from our Latin America and Caribbean editor,
*24:04.720- 24:09.740* :  Vanessa Buschlütte. The reason why they've extended the state of emergency from the capital
*24:10.000- 24:15.960* :  is that in the past, in the past months, the most egregious violence has always been concentrated
*24:15.960- 24:20.460* :  in the capital, but that has changed. It has now spread to some of the provinces.
*24:20.740- 24:25.380* :  Artibim Bonit, for example, which is to the northwest of the capital now has seen
*24:25.380- 24:31.920* :  kidnappings and extortion and attacks on people who are traveling to get food.
*24:31.920- 24:38.360* :  And so this situation obviously has prompted the measure taken by the prime minister to extend
*24:38.360- 24:43.560* :  that state of emergency. But what many locals are saying is that with that extension of the state
*24:43.560- 24:49.320* :  of emergency, there's no real change on the ground. It's not like more police are then deployed
*24:49.320- 24:53.940* :  or more resources are sent to the police. And so they're saying those are just words
*24:53.940- 24:59.480* :  not really action. And these 400 Kenyan peacekeepers are spread extremely thin, aren't they?
*24:59.640- 25:05.740* :  Absolutely. And they themselves have been saying that they haven't really gone to the front line
*25:05.740- 25:12.500* :  as they term it because they haven't been given the armored vehicles or the body armor to be able
*25:12.500- 25:17.740* :  to do so. So the commander of the Kenyan forces has been speaking to media back in Kenya,
*25:17.740- 25:25.200* :  bemoaning this very fact and also calling for other nations to help strengthen that multinational force.
*25:25.340- 25:30.480* :  Which brings us to Anthony Blinken's visit today. What can we expect to possibly come out
*25:30.480- 25:37.180* :  from that? A spokesperson for the State Department has said that Mr Blinken wants to get an idea
*25:37.180- 25:43.800* :  on the ground of what is needed. But it sounds like he might also be calling for a more nations
*25:43.800- 25:49.620* :  to participate in that multinational force. And according to one article in the Miami Herald,
*25:49.620- 25:55.220* :  he may even be considering changing the status of that multinational force to a UN-led force,
*25:55.220- 26:00.280* :  which would mean that the funding would be guaranteed. Funding is the key problem here. And that's
*26:00.280- 26:06.840* :  what the Kenyans and the Haitians are both saying. Vanessa Bushlooter. The European Union, the US
*26:06.840- 26:13.080* :  and the UK are among nearly 50 countries that have signed the first ever global treaty on artificial
*26:13.080- 26:18.480* :  intelligence. The likes of Japan, Israel and Canada are also on board with the legally binding
*26:18.780- 26:23.620* :  agreement, which focuses on protecting human rights and democracy from the latest technology.
*26:24.220- 26:29.820* :  So, we climb in reports. It's an international agreement on the priorities of AI legislation.
*26:29.980- 26:34.940* :  And there's lots of different countries involved in this. There are 46 members of the Council of
*26:34.940- 26:38.840* :  Europe alone. And they've also brought in 11 other countries as well, including quite big
*26:38.840- 26:44.600* :  territories like the US and Japan. Now, to be honest with you, the actual content of it,
*26:44.600- 26:49.780* :  if you follow AI regulation conversations quite closely like I do, isn't really anything that you
*26:49.780- 26:55.040* :  haven't heard before. It's designed to protect human rights and democracy from AI risks. It's
*26:55.040- 27:00.140* :  designed to protect the public from the misuse of AI tools. It names issues like the spread of
*27:00.140- 27:05.860* :  disinformation and the use of biased data as problems that it wants to safeguard against. And it
*27:05.860- 27:11.140* :  commits the countries that have signed up to monitor AI developments and products. What's
*27:11.140- 27:16.820* :  missing from it is any kind of enforcement mechanism. There's no carrot or stick to keep AI
*27:16.820- 27:22.080* :  companies in line. But that's deliberate because the onus is now going to be on the signatories to
*27:22.080- 27:26.820* :  come up with their own legislation. And here's the thing. As we know, a lot of them are actually
*27:26.820- 27:31.860* :  doing that already. And in the case of the EU, they've done it. We've got the EU AI act. So,
*27:31.860- 27:36.260* :  while this is symbolic, I don't think you're going to suddenly see what we're really waiting for
*27:36.260- 27:41.140* :  in this AI regulation journey that we're on, which is clear rules and clear consequences.
*27:41.160- 27:44.200* :  That's not going to happen quite yet. Zoe Kleinman.
*27:45.200- 27:50.480* :  There was a time when the northern sea route was attempted only by the more daring of sailors.
*27:51.100- 27:56.000* :  It takes ships from the north of Europe through thousands of kilometers of volatile seas between
*27:56.000- 28:01.080* :  the north coast of Russia and the Arctic, much of it blocked by ice for most of the year.
*28:01.540- 28:07.160* :  And then down into East Asia. But Russia's president Putin wants more cargo ships to use that
*28:07.160- 28:12.140* :  route. And he's called for foreign investment to make it easier. So, what's the thinking behind
*28:12.140- 28:17.960* :  it? I asked our Europe regional editor Paul Moss. Well, two reasons really, Nick. On the one hand,
*28:17.960- 28:22.760* :  there's more of a need for it. And rather usefully, that needs come as time when traveling
*28:22.760- 28:28.280* :  via the northern sea routes become more easy. First, time a ship actually went down. It was in 1878.
*28:28.540- 28:33.100* :  It was captain by a Swedish explorer. But most of the time, as you say, ships can't get through
*28:33.560- 28:38.060* :  there's ice in the way. So, it's not really a reliable route for cargo. Instead, from Europe to
*28:38.060- 28:42.640* :  Asia or the other way around, they go via the southern point of Africa. All the Sue is can now
*28:42.640- 28:48.180* :  thousands of kilometers longer. So, what's changed? Well, the climate has changed. Global warming
*28:48.180- 28:53.540* :  means that sea ice is melting. The Arctic is retreating. Most people, of course, see climate
*28:53.540- 28:58.200* :  changes of threat to humanity, but some clearly regarded as representing an opportunity. So,
*28:58.200- 29:04.040* :  for the past few years, there's been more cargo going through. But now, not only is there the
*29:04.040- 29:09.700* :  possibility of using this route, there's also more of a need. Russia has, of course, been sanctioned
*29:09.700- 29:15.260* :  by most countries in Europe. So, Vladimir Putin's looking to increase trade with Asia. Just the right
*29:15.260- 29:20.120* :  moment to open up this new route. Another incentive I should mention is that the alternative,
*29:20.120- 29:24.880* :  the Sue as Canal has started looking rather more risky. We've had goofy rebels firing rockets
*29:24.880- 29:30.000* :  at shipping. And you may remember the Canal was blocked at one point. So, all these reasons
*29:30.000- 29:35.300* :  means that Russia's keen to make the North Sea route far more viable and far more used.
*29:35.840- 29:39.940* :  And Paul, what is Russia doing to encourage the use of the Northern Sea route?
*29:40.340- 29:45.180* :  He's brought some brand new ice breakers, one of them nuclear powered. And he's going to
*29:45.400- 29:49.780* :  construct other so that when there is sea ice, they can ram right through it. He wants to develop
*29:49.780- 29:54.960* :  a transport hub around the Russian port of Mermansk, which also involves building railways there.
*29:55.460- 30:00.720* :  And at the Eastern Economic Forum, he asks foreigners to invest in this developing that port.
*30:01.140- 30:05.540* :  Of course, there's an incentive for countries in Asia to use this route because they too
*30:05.540- 30:11.080* :  can send their ships the other way. Get them to Europe far more quickly. Now, I should say that
*30:11.300- 30:16.080* :  this economic forum is a chance for Vladimir Putin to act like the big regional leader to say
*30:16.080- 30:21.420* :  Russia's open for business with a strong economy. Not everyone is convinced by this,
*30:21.420- 30:26.840* :  Russia is putting huge amounts of its resources into invading Ukraine, taking people out of the
*30:26.840- 30:32.280* :  workforce to send them into battle, often to be killed, of course. So, not everyone is convinced
*30:32.280- 30:37.100* :  that the Russia is a place for investors to stick their money. But clearly, if Vladimir Putin
*30:37.100- 30:41.700* :  wants to persuade them the North Sea route is a good place to invest. Paul Moss.
*30:43.020- 30:49.140* :  Barnhill Cottage lies at the end of a narrow lane called the Long Road. It's surrounded by
*30:49.140- 30:56.020* :  Moorland on the Scottish Hebridean island of Dura. It's a desolate place and was the perfect setting
*30:56.020- 31:02.980* :  for George Orwell to write his dystopian masterpiece, 1984. And now there are efforts to establish a very
*31:02.980- 31:09.140* :  orwellian type of library there, made up entirely of copies of that one book. Terry Egan reports.
*31:20.740- 31:26.260* :  The remote Scottish island of Dura has long been a place of pilgrimage for fans of George Orwell.
*31:26.260- 31:33.120* :  It has a population of just over 200 and it's where towards the end of his life Orwell wrote his
*31:33.120- 31:39.620* :  magnificently bleak novel, 1984, about a future under the dictatorship of Big Brother.
*31:42.700- 31:48.400* :  Earlier this year, to mark the 75th anniversary of 1984 being published, an artist,
*31:48.400- 31:57.600* :  Hans K. Klausen, collected 1,984 copies of the book together. That library, which is currently
*31:57.600- 32:05.700* :  touring, is based in Edinburgh. Now though, Mr. Klausen wants to give his mobile library a home in Dura.
*32:06.040- 32:11.540* :  We took this novel back home to the island where it was written and now we want to take the library
*32:12.040- 32:16.620* :  across the UK, possibly even further, and it's going to be an interactive library. We want to take
*32:16.620- 32:22.020* :  it to organisations, to institutions, to places of learning, and then after a year or two of touring,
*32:22.020- 32:27.800* :  I'd love to take it back and give it its permanent home in Dura and make it a place of destination there.
*32:28.020- 32:32.320* :  People from all over the world already travel to Dura for the Orwell connection.
*32:32.380- 32:37.760* :  As it stands though, they currently face a long drive, followed by a difficult walk,
*32:37.820- 32:44.360* :  sometimes just a stand and look at a house. Mr. Klausen wants to change all that,
*32:44.360- 32:49.840* :  and the project has the backing of people there associated with the Orwell family and the Orwell
*32:49.840- 32:56.020* :  Foundation, which promotes writers who share the author's values. Dura was Orwell's home towards
*32:56.020- 33:01.660* :  the end of his life, and it would have influenced the mood of that book. But spoiler alert,
*33:02.220- 33:08.780* :  while things don't end well for 1984's protagonist Winston Smith, hopefully they will turn out
*33:08.780- 33:17.200* :  better for the library dedicated to his story. That report was by Terry Egan.
*33:18.920- 33:22.360* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast
*33:22.360- 33:27.240* :  later on. If you want a comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*33:27.240- 33:33.680* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on x at Global News
*33:33.800- 33:38.600* :  Pod. This edition was mixed by Pat Sissons and the producer was Alfie Habersham.
*33:39.020- 33:42.620* :  The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Nick Miles and until next time, goodbye.
*33:51.500- 33:57.100* :  That justice system ultimately ignored all of those bodies and all of the families.
*33:57.500- 34:01.660* :  The stories they don't want told. I was one of many people that were victims who was used.
*34:01.960- 34:06.560* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity. Holding the powerful to account.
*34:07.240- 34:10.780* :  The culture of secrecy needs to be broken.
