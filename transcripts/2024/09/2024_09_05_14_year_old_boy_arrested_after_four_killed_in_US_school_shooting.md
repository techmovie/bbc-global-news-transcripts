*01:41.940- 01:45.220* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:47.220- 01:52.420* :  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Thursday the 5th of September these are our main stories.
*01:53.220- 01:58.320* :  Police in the US state of Georgia say a 14 year old has been detained following a high school
*01:58.320- 02:04.860* :  shooting in which four people were killed. The US sanctions Russian state media executives as it
*02:04.860- 02:10.440* :  accuses Moscow of a widespread campaign to interfere with this year's presidential election.
*02:11.420- 02:17.160* :  Mexico's congress moves ahead with controversial judicial reforms despite widespread protests.
*02:19.820- 02:26.200* :  Also in this podcast animal rights groups say a much loved whale suspected of being a Russian spy
*02:26.200- 02:33.800* :  was shot dead. The injuries that are clearly visible are so serious and so concerning
*02:34.500- 02:38.460* :  that we want the police to be involved in an hourly stage of this process.
*02:42.880- 02:48.460* :  We start with a story that is all too sadly familiar. A school shooting in the US which has left
*02:48.460- 02:54.360* :  four people dead. Officials have named a 14 year old student cult gray as a suspected
*02:54.360- 03:00.160* :  government. The school in state of Georgia is around 70 kilometers northeast of the state capital
*03:00.160- 03:05.380* :  Atlanta. These students described the moment they realized a shooting was underway.
*03:06.060- 03:12.240* :  We heard some loud bangs like gunshots in the hallway and we heard some of them were
*03:12.240- 03:17.780* :  the panicking felt like they were going to pass hours something and after like 20, 15 minutes
*03:17.780- 03:23.400* :  the cops came. Two police officers came in with their guns telling us that this is not a drill
*03:23.880- 03:29.220* :  and that we still not safe the school still not safe. The director of the Georgia Bureau of
*03:29.220- 03:34.620* :  Investigation Chris Hosey gave this briefing to reporters. This is a murder investigation.
*03:35.060- 03:42.760* :  The shooter is in custody. His name is Colt. That's COLT Gray. He is a 14 year old student.
*03:43.560- 03:49.120* :  He is a 14 year old student here at the high school. Again he has been taken into custody.
*03:49.120- 03:52.160* :  He will be charged with murder and he will be tried as an adult.
*03:53.220- 03:58.520* :  President Joe Biden said he was mourning the dead and that Americans could no longer accept
*03:58.520- 04:04.580* :  such shootings as normal. The sentiment echoed by the vice president Kamala Harris as she spoke
*04:04.580- 04:11.700* :  at an election rally in New Hampshire. And it's just outrageous that every day in our country and the
*04:11.700- 04:18.500* :  United States of America that parents have to send their children to school worried about whether or
*04:18.500- 04:25.820* :  not their child will come home alive. It's senseless. We've got to stop it and we have to end this
*04:25.820- 04:32.060* :  epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for all. I heard more about the shooting from our
*04:32.060- 04:38.260* :  U.S. correspondent Nitatovik. Law enforcement were on the scene within minutes they say they also
*04:38.260- 04:44.560* :  actually had two resource officers who are posted at the school who were the first to encounter
*04:44.600- 04:51.220* :  the suspect. And they said that when they encountered the suspect he immediately surrendered,
*04:51.220- 04:57.840* :  got on the floor and was taken into custody. Now they have identified him as Colt Gray.
*04:57.840- 05:05.580* :  He is a 14-year-old who went to the school who is a student there. And they say that before
*05:05.740- 05:14.240* :  they apprehended the suspect, two students and two teachers had been killed. And nine others
*05:14.240- 05:21.000* :  also suffered gunshot wounds and are being treated at the hospital. They have been able to
*05:21.000- 05:26.980* :  interview the suspect and get in touch with his family. And they say he's going to be charged as
*05:27.340- 05:33.260* :  an adult for murder. And that's despite the fact that he's only 14 years old.
*05:34.200- 05:40.860* :  That's right. And inevitably it's raised the question, how has a 14-year-old been able to go into
*05:40.860- 05:50.280* :  school with a gun without any kind of warning signs beforehand? This is something that has happened
*05:50.300- 05:55.380* :  before in the United States. Of course, school shootings have become something of an epidemic.
*05:56.180- 06:01.560* :  And it's become such a normal part of students' lives that it's really intolerable.
*06:02.100- 06:06.960* :  And we've had the Vice President Kamala Harris talking about this gun epidemic. We've had
*06:06.960- 06:13.800* :  the President Joe Biden talking about how this has to stop. He has tried in the past to bring
*06:13.800- 06:19.880* :  in tighter gun controls but failed. This shooting comes two months before the US presidential election.
*06:19.960- 06:26.200* :  It's occurred in a crucial swing state. Will it be any different this time? Could this shooting play into
*06:26.200- 06:31.700* :  political considerations? Well, look, Kamala Harris was campaigning in New Hampshire,
*06:31.700- 06:38.140* :  but she took the time to stop and speak about Georgia. And she said this is going to be an issue
*06:38.140- 06:45.620* :  in this election. Look, I've been covering school shootings since Newtown Connecticut in 2012,
*06:45.620- 06:55.240* :  when 26 people were killed, including 26 and 7-year-olds. And after that, when there was no action,
*06:55.240- 07:03.760* :  many felt it would be almost impossible to get any kind of political will to change laws.
*07:04.140- 07:07.980* :  You know, parents of those students, families of those students have become activists.
*07:08.860- 07:15.180* :  Since then, there have been many other school shootings. And even with all of the kind of calls
*07:16.480- 07:22.820* :  and campaigns, even with more data coming out about the effects of gun violence and the fact that
*07:22.820- 07:30.700* :  it kills youth more than any other cause in this country, there is a real kind of problem in
*07:30.700- 07:35.760* :  getting the two sides together. You have those who want to protect the right to bear arms,
*07:35.760- 07:41.060* :  the Second Amendment, and who fear that any kind of stricter regulations would just take away
*07:41.060- 07:45.300* :  their rights. And you have those who want universal background checks,
*07:45.300- 07:51.580* :  bans on assault weapons, who feel that those kind of what they say common-sense gun laws
*07:51.580- 07:57.400* :  should be something that is easy to get through. There should be compromise. But there hasn't been a
*07:57.400- 08:03.180* :  way to kind of bridge that gap over the years. And right now, as you say, there's a presidential
*08:03.180- 08:10.000* :  election. And so it's very unlikely that there will be any movement until at least a new
*08:10.000- 08:14.420* :  president is elected. And even then, it really depends on what shape Congress is in.
*08:16.640- 08:22.020* :  The US has for years accused Russia and other hostile nations of attempting to influence its
*08:22.020- 08:27.480* :  presidential elections. Now it's announced that sanctions have been imposed against two
*08:27.480- 08:33.440* :  editors of the Russian state broadcaster RT, accusing them of spreading Kremlin propaganda to
*08:33.440- 08:39.000* :  influence this November's election. Eight other people said to have been involved in the operation
*08:39.000- 08:44.040* :  have also been sanctioned. The US Attorney General, Merrick Garland, said the Justice Department
*08:44.040- 08:50.060* :  would aggressively counter Russian efforts to undermine American democracy, including taking
*08:50.060- 08:56.220* :  action against multiple internet domains he said were engaging in covert campaigns to interfere
*08:56.220- 09:02.660* :  with the US election. These websites were designed to appear to American readers as if they were
*09:02.660- 09:09.360* :  major US news sites like the Washington Post or Fox News. But in fact, they were fake sites.
*09:10.000- 09:14.180* :  They were filled with Russian government propaganda that had been created by the Kremlin
*09:14.180- 09:20.140* :  to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and interests,
*09:20.140- 09:26.920* :  and influence voters in the United States and in other countries. Internal documents of the
*09:26.920- 09:33.300* :  Kremlin described the content as, quote, bogus stories disguised as newsworthy events. Close
*09:33.300- 09:37.620* :  quote. My correspondent in Washington, Jenny Kuma, told us more.
*09:38.080- 09:43.740* :  Well, there's some 65 days until the US presidential elections and the Biden administration
*09:43.740- 09:50.900* :  has called out what it says is Russian interference in that vote. Now multiple government agencies
*09:50.900- 09:56.800* :  have announced a range of measures to tackle the spread of Russian disinformation and that
*09:57.340- 10:04.280* :  includes visa restrictions, sanctions and indictments. Now amongst that, the US Treasury Department
*10:04.280- 10:12.100* :  has indicted the managing editor of RT, the Russian state broadcaster and her deputy. Now they're
*10:12.100- 10:20.120* :  accused of spending 10 million pounds to secretly pay an unnamed company in Tennessee to spread
*10:20.120- 10:27.100* :  thousands of videos on social media. Now in a statement to the BBC, RT has dismissed the claims
*10:27.100- 10:35.260* :  in a mocking statement saying 2016 called and it wants its cliches back a reference to Russian
*10:35.260- 10:42.900* :  interference in past US elections. So why would Russia do this? Well the US says it's because it
*10:42.900- 10:49.980* :  wants to so division amongst American voters and to undermine international support for Ukraine which
*10:49.980- 10:57.300* :  Russia invaded two years ago. Now the US says it's not just Russia doing this, it's also points
*10:57.340- 11:06.920* :  to Iran and China and last month it accused Iran of hacking at the Trump campaign and leaking
*11:06.920- 11:15.300* :  documents. It also has accused Iran of trying to hack the Harris campaign. Jenny Kumar, next let's
*11:15.300- 11:24.560* :  turn to Mexico. Where demonstrators took to the streets to express their alarm of a controversial
*11:24.560- 11:30.160* :  reforms to the country's judicial system. Despite the protests, the reforms were approved by the
*11:30.160- 11:35.400* :  lower house of the Mexican Congress in a marathon session on Tuesday night. Under the plans, which
*11:35.400- 11:41.240* :  also have to be approved by the Senate, 7,000 magistrates and judges, including Supreme Court
*11:41.240- 11:46.920* :  Justices, will be elected by popular vote. The opposition and rights groups say it's an effort by
*11:46.920- 11:53.680* :  the outgoing president, Andreas Manuel Lopez-Obrador, to concentrate power in the hands of his left-wing
*11:54.140- 11:59.720* :  party. I ask our correspondent in Mexico City will grant tell us more about these reforms and why
*11:59.720- 12:06.580* :  they're so controversial. I think it's the element of the popular vote for pretty much every judge
*12:06.580- 12:11.800* :  in the country and magistrate, including those sitting on the Supreme Court. That is the element
*12:11.800- 12:18.240* :  which those opposition parties and the protesters believe that is undermining Mexican democracy,
*12:18.240- 12:25.480* :  but which supporters of President Lopez-Obrador claim is a sort of root and branch reform of the
*12:25.480- 12:31.760* :  judiciary, which is riddled with corruption, much of which comes from the malign influence of
*12:31.760- 12:37.440* :  organized crime. It's interesting the timing of this, because President Lopez-Obrador's term
*12:37.440- 12:43.640* :  finishes soon. His successor, Claudia Scheinbaum, is from the same party, so why is he doing this now?
*12:44.120- 12:48.640* :  I think it's his final pillar, really, of his political project. It's one thing that he has
*12:48.640- 12:54.420* :  often talked about, just how much he believes that the judicial system in Mexico isn't fit for
*12:54.420- 12:58.980* :  purpose anymore, that is beholden to political elites in the country, and as I mentioned,
*12:58.980- 13:04.920* :  it contains organized crime, the influence of organized crime. So I think it is something that was
*13:04.920- 13:10.400* :  very important to him personally, into his political project, with him stepping down, even though
*13:10.400- 13:14.980* :  his successor has committed to the project, I think it's something that he himself want to
*13:14.980- 13:20.440* :  design into law, and of course he has both the lower and upper chambers of parliament, so it's
*13:20.440- 13:24.860* :  going to essentially be rubber stamped by his supporters. So it looks like this is going to go
*13:24.860- 13:30.520* :  through, but this move is also creating tensions with the US and Canada. Yeah, absolutely,
*13:30.520- 13:35.120* :  the two other states that are part of the free trade agreement of the North American region
*13:35.460- 13:40.960* :  have real reservations about what this means for a Mexican democracy. We've seen investors
*13:41.500- 13:46.280* :  pull out and be very, very spooked, the markets clearly spooked by what's going on,
*13:46.680- 13:53.240* :  because it looks to markets at least that this is a sort of authoritarian move, that this, as you
*13:53.240- 13:57.220* :  mentioned in your introduction, is an effort to concentrate power in the hands of the executive,
*13:57.220- 14:03.940* :  and certainly in the hands of the party, loyal to President Lopez Obrador. So yeah, it will go
*14:03.940- 14:08.460* :  through almost certainly, but it doesn't stop it being very, very controversial still.
*14:09.560- 14:14.260* :  We'll grant in Mexico. Here in Britain, there have been calls for government action
*14:14.260- 14:21.060* :  over building safety after an inquiry found that all 72 deaths in the Grenfell Tower fire in
*14:21.060- 14:28.300* :  West London in 2017 were avoidable. Survivors and victims families have also criticised what they
*14:28.300- 14:34.360* :  called the long delay for justice after the blaze. The fire broke out on the fourth floor of the
*14:34.360- 14:39.300* :  tower block because of a faulty fridge before the flames then raced up the sides of the building,
*14:39.300- 14:44.600* :  trapping residents on the upper levels. The inquiry blamed years of government
*14:44.600- 14:51.100* :  inaction and corporate read and dishonesty for the disaster which was caused by flammable cladding.
*14:51.100- 14:56.820* :  The British Prime Minister, Kirstama, has apologised to the families. Speaking in Parliament,
*14:56.820- 15:01.060* :  he said his government would take action to hold those responsible to account.
*15:01.060- 15:06.120* :  In the light of such findings, it is imperative that there is full accountability,
*15:06.880- 15:12.460* :  including through the criminal justice process, and that this happens as swiftly as possible.
*15:13.860- 15:18.120* :  So I can tell the House today that this government will write to all companies found by the inquiry
*15:18.640- 15:23.120* :  to be part of these horrific failings as the first step to stopping them being awarded
*15:23.120- 15:29.460* :  government contracts. Two residents of Grenfell Tower have spoken to the BBC about the events of
*15:29.460- 15:36.020* :  that day more than seven years ago, and how they hope Wednesday's report will bring about real change.
*15:36.060- 15:42.540* :  Our special correspondent Lucy Manning went to meet them. 72 names were read out by the inquiry
*15:42.540- 15:49.060* :  chairman. One of them was Khadija Khaloofi. In northwest London, her mother, brother, sister and
*15:49.060- 15:56.160* :  niece, watched a Samaritan more big remembered her and the others who died. The 52-year-old lived
*15:56.160- 16:01.740* :  on the 17th floor of Grenfell, and it's believed she went to check on another family as she tried
*16:01.740- 16:09.140* :  to escape. She never made it out of the building. Her brother Karim now has the 1700 pages of the
*16:09.140- 16:16.760* :  report that amplifies his feelings of injustice, grief and fury. When you are here and everything
*16:16.760- 16:25.660* :  was available, you heard also because of their dishonesty. You have anger inside you. You said
*16:26.400- 16:37.740* :  what are they waiting for to make charges to give us injustice? We are traumatized. We are empty
*16:37.740- 16:44.500* :  inside now. Marcio and Andrea Gomez and their two children were trapped on the 21st floor. They
*16:44.500- 16:51.280* :  survived, but Andrea was seven months pregnant, and baby Logan was still born. Mr Gomez said the
*16:51.280- 16:56.620* :  police always said they needed to wait for the inquiry, and now it has reported the police investigation
*16:56.660- 17:03.520* :  must give them justice. We knew exactly what our truth was. It's great to see it now in black and
*17:03.520- 17:08.920* :  white written down, but you can see there from the fraudulent, the greed, the dishonesty that was
*17:09.340- 17:14.840* :  going on. Does it give you the answers about how and why your little baby died? No, I don't think it
*17:14.840- 17:21.100* :  gives me the answers of how Logan dies or how anybody dies. I mean, we can see there it could have
*17:21.100- 17:26.360* :  been all avoidable. There is anger among some of the bereaved that the six-year inquiry meant the
*17:26.360- 17:32.660* :  police investigation was delayed, and no charges are expected anytime soon. Grenfell wasn't just a
*17:32.660- 17:40.020* :  building but a community, and those who died there, the babies, children, parents, and grandparents
*17:40.020- 17:48.360* :  were killed. The report is clear by dishonesty, disregard, and greed. That report by Lucy Manning.
*17:49.400- 17:55.120* :  There's been an unexpected twist in the death of a much-loved whale. If you remember, Baldemir,
*17:55.120- 18:01.160* :  he was the beluga whale discovered off the coast of Norway back in 2019, wearing a harness with
*18:01.160- 18:06.720* :  a mount for a camera. That led some to suspect the whale, who showed interest in people and seemed
*18:06.720- 18:13.300* :  used to them, had been sent by Russia on a spying mission. Well, Baldemir remained in Norwegian waters,
*18:13.300- 18:19.300* :  but this week he was found dead, and now an animal welfare charity, which got to see the whale's
*18:19.300- 18:25.480* :  dead body, says he was shot repeatedly. Our Europe Regional Editor Paul Moss reports.
*18:31.140- 18:36.400* :  They live for decades, and their high intelligence means that some whales are open to being trained.
*18:37.160- 18:42.100* :  So it was perhaps inevitable they would be seen as having a potential military use.
*18:45.520- 18:50.900* :  Both the old Soviet Union and the United States operated programs, which included beluga whales,
*18:50.900- 18:57.260* :  as well as dolphins. Sea mammals were tried out for rescuing navy divers, spotting enemy vessels,
*18:57.840- 19:03.380* :  and even detecting mines. So when a beluga whale turned up off the northern coast of Norway,
*19:03.380- 19:08.840* :  with what seemed to be a camera holder, there was obvious suspicion it had been sent on a Russian
*19:08.840- 19:15.580* :  espionage mission. The harness had a label saying St. Petersburg, but despite the apparently hostile
*19:15.580- 19:22.000* :  intent of his handlers, Baldemir became something of a celebrity, an aquatic James Bond who never
*19:22.000- 19:28.840* :  strayed far from Scandinavian waters. But that all ended this week when Baldemir was found dead by
*19:28.840- 19:34.840* :  two people outfishing. Among those who examined the carcass was Sirri Martensen, a vet from the
*19:34.840- 19:43.360* :  animal charity Noa. She believes the whale had been shot. The injuries that are clearly visible
*19:43.360- 19:50.060* :  are so serious and so concerning that we want the police to be involved in an early stage of this
*19:50.060- 19:56.100* :  process. So that is why we have filed a police report today. It will take three weeks for an
*19:56.100- 20:02.400* :  official autopsy report to be issued, but without any obvious assailant, its possible Baldemir's death
*20:02.400- 20:10.700* :  will remain as mysterious as his sadly interrupted life. That report by Paul Moss.
*20:13.940- 20:18.060* :  Still to come? I obviously got myself a trolley. I went straight over to the
*20:18.140- 20:25.540* :  Froome Veg section where I got a pineapple, placed it upside down in my trolley. So what exactly
*20:25.540- 20:28.060* :  is happening in Stif Markis in Spain?

*21:51.380- 21:56.660* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast. There's been chaos and gridlock across Nigeria.
*21:56.660- 22:02.700* :  After a hike in fuel prices by the state-owned oil company exacerbated a chronic shortage.
*22:03.340- 22:11.000* :  Nigeria's National Petroleum Company, NNPC, put up the price per liter of petrol by 40 US cents.
*22:11.400- 22:12.380* :  Well, Ross, reports.
*22:13.120- 22:18.160* :  Nigeria's state-owned petroleum company said mounting debts and rising global fuel prices had
*22:18.160- 22:22.680* :  led to the shortages. At many filling stations, there are long queues with some people sleeping
*22:22.680- 22:28.000* :  in their cars. But it's not just motorists who need to fill up. Most homes have small diesel generators
*22:28.000- 22:32.560* :  because the electricity supply is so inadequate. Now many people are pinning their hopes on a new
*22:32.560- 22:38.200* :  oil refinery set up by one of Africa's richest men, Aliko Dangote. It's just started producing
*22:38.200- 22:43.160* :  petrol, but in a sign of how topsy-turvy the whole industry is, the refinery has had to
*22:43.160- 22:46.360* :  source much of its crude oil from as far away as Brazil.
*22:47.380- 22:52.500* :  Will Ross. The concept of dynamic pricing when companies suddenly inflate prices at times
*22:52.500- 22:58.720* :  of high demand is relatively common in the US, but it's starting to become more of an issue in Europe,
*22:59.620- 23:04.920* :  especially for live music events. Recently there was outrage when concert tickets for the rock band
*23:04.920- 23:10.480* :  OASIS more than doubled in price while people were queuing online to buy them. The EU commission
*23:10.480- 23:14.500* :  has now said it will examine the practice as Shantar Hartle explains.
*23:14.620- 23:20.420* :  When it comes to booking things such as airline tickets, hotels and some ride-hailing services,
*23:21.000- 23:26.500* :  dynamic pricing is nothing new. There's no legal issue here either, as long as businesses follow
*23:26.500- 23:31.900* :  consumer laws. But there are concerns that this strategy is becoming increasingly common in the
*23:31.900- 23:38.820* :  music industry, pricing fans out of gigs. Last weekend, fans of the band OASIS spent hours in
*23:38.820- 23:44.180* :  an online queuing system for the Groups reunion tour. The advertised price of a standard ticket
*23:44.180- 23:50.920* :  was $177 US dollars. But for some who continued to wait, a pop-up message appeared,
*23:50.920- 23:57.880* :  alerting them that due to high demand, the fee had gone up to more than $400. At that point,
*23:57.880- 24:03.040* :  some, like four James, gave up. I was queuing for around five and a half hours or so,
*24:03.040- 24:07.520* :  but refused to pay that price when I eventually got through. It was far too expensive to justify
*24:07.520- 24:13.400* :  the cost, really. In the US, laws have been introduced in Minnesota and Massachusetts, which force
*24:13.400- 24:19.680* :  online ticket sellers to disclose the total cost upfront, prompted by a number of issues when
*24:19.680- 24:25.880* :  Taylor Swift fans attempted to book tickets for her last US tour. The upset about ticket price
*24:25.880- 24:31.040* :  inflation has now reached Brussels. The EU Commission has confirmed it will look into dynamic
*24:31.040- 24:37.340* :  pricing as part of a review of digital consumer laws. As spokesperson said, the strategy could
*24:37.340- 24:43.640* :  potentially breach EU policies if the price was increased after a consumer had put the tickets
*24:43.640- 24:50.680* :  in their online basket. The Dutch MEP Lara Volters went one step further, saying new laws were
*24:50.680- 24:56.500* :  necessary to protect music fans from being ripped off by what she described as a soulless practice.
*24:57.900- 24:58.860* :  Chantal Hartel
*24:59.520- 25:04.520* :  If you think about illegal smuggling, perhaps weapons or drugs come to mind, but conservationists
*25:04.520- 25:10.200* :  around the globe are increasingly worrying about plant smuggling. The practice of harvesting rare
*25:10.200- 25:15.680* :  and often endangered species from one country and shipping them off to another. Gardeners are
*25:15.680- 25:20.000* :  buying the illicit plants online, often without knowing that they're breaking the law.
*25:20.740- 25:26.760* :  So the Royal Botanic Gardens at Q here in London and traffic and NGO dedicated to protecting
*25:26.760- 25:33.940* :  wild species are teaming up with eBay to try to get the plant leaves off the platform. Dominique
*25:33.940- 25:40.340* :  Prinsloo is a project manager for traffic in Cape Town in South Africa. Celia Hatton started by
*25:40.340- 25:45.480* :  asking her how big this business is. It's probably much larger than the general public
*25:45.480- 25:51.900* :  expected. We've had hundreds and thousands of plants seized in South Africa. That we're making
*25:51.900- 25:58.160* :  their way to overseas markets. Unfortunately, it's not just South Africa. The Southern African
*25:58.160- 26:03.980* :  East Africa is at straight as well with a lot of plant species in demand from various countries
*26:03.980- 26:10.900* :  in these regions. And how organized is this market? Who's going out to seize these plants and
*26:10.900- 26:16.860* :  who's who's profiting? This is actually quite an organized crime. It's a lot more organized than
*26:16.860- 26:22.980* :  was originally thought. It's very much unfortunately locals in South Africa and other Southern African
*26:22.980- 26:30.260* :  countries are recruited to access these plants in the wild harvest them and then bring them to hubs
*26:30.260- 26:36.800* :  in South Africa where they are collated and shipped to markets overseas. And what plants are
*26:36.800- 26:43.980* :  trafficked the most? In South Africa, particularly we have got a succulent plant from a dwarf
*26:43.980- 26:49.940* :  succulence which only occur in certain areas in the western part of the country to sort of
*26:50.060- 26:54.820* :  taller succulents. Some of the main species that we are seeing are part of a genus called
*26:54.820- 27:01.000* :  phyton which is a dwarf succulent with very pretty flowers and these are unfortunately illegally
*27:01.000- 27:07.280* :  harvested on mass. We've had over one million seized plants represented over 600 different species
*27:07.280- 27:13.560* :  that have been illegally harvested. So it's a big business. What does this mean for ordinary people
*27:13.560- 27:19.260* :  who might be interested in buying plants online? Is there any way to tell if a plant is trafficked?
*27:19.320- 27:24.920* :  Is quite challenging to tell whether a plant was illegally harvested or harvested from the wild
*27:24.920- 27:30.960* :  versus artificially propagated? We at traffic along with a few other organizations. So our partners
*27:30.960- 27:36.040* :  at the Royal Botanic Gardens Q as well as the South African National Biodiversity Institute
*27:36.560- 27:42.260* :  have worked together to coming up with ways that buyers can find out whether their purchases of
*27:42.260- 27:47.360* :  plants are legal, sustainable and ethical. So it's very difficult to tell from looking at an
*27:47.360- 27:52.580* :  advert online. We do encourage buyers to ask more questions to the sellers. Specifically,
*27:52.580- 27:56.980* :  you know, where did the plants come from? What is the species? Is it protected by national
*27:57.720- 28:03.180* :  legislation? And is it threatened by illegal harvesting? And what about prosecutions? Have we seen
*28:03.180- 28:08.480* :  any attempts to really shut down these organized rings? There have been numerous successful
*28:08.480- 28:14.140* :  prosecutions. There has been a lot of awareness by various organizations and law enforcement agencies
*28:14.500- 28:18.780* :  trying to make sure that prosecutors and magistrates are aware of the severity of the crime,
*28:18.780- 28:23.420* :  trying to ensure that the attention that's paid to the case and that the penalties that are
*28:23.720- 28:27.680* :  given are adequate to try and deter individuals from getting involved.
*28:28.020- 28:33.500* :  And last Dominic, why does it matter so much that we shut down this practice of selling
*28:33.500- 28:38.700* :  illicit plants online? What would happen if we didn't try to stop it? This trade severely
*28:38.700- 28:44.880* :  impacts biodiversity in South Africa and also southern Namibia. This area supports more than
*28:44.880- 28:51.100* :  6,000 succulent species of which 40% are endemic. And what we're seeing is single, you know,
*28:51.100- 28:56.680* :  illegal harvesting episodes have resulted in whole species extensions. So losing these species,
*28:56.680- 29:02.560* :  it degrades ecosystems, it deprives, you know, South African communities of their natural
*29:02.560- 29:08.520* :  resources. And it also, it criminalizes individuals who are drawn into this illegal harvesting
*29:08.520- 29:13.020* :  and this trade for financial gain. That's why it's so urgent that it must be addressed.
*29:14.500- 29:17.920* :  Dominic Prinsloo from the Conservation NGO Traffic.
*29:19.020- 29:25.420* :  Now, are you looking for a date? I don't mean the fruit, but a fruit could help you find one.
*29:25.480- 29:30.340* :  The reason I say that is because people in Spain have been going to supermarkets to try to find
*29:30.340- 29:37.240* :  partners between 7 and 8 pm local time. People have flooded to the mercadonna supermarkets all
*29:37.240- 29:42.780* :  around the country and they've put an upside down pineapple in their basket to show that they're
*29:42.780- 29:49.900* :  single. They hope other people with pineapples will notice them and make a move. The trend has gone
*29:49.900- 29:55.700* :  viral on TikTok and in Bilbao, the police were called in because of rowdy scenes at one super
*29:55.700- 30:01.760* :  market. So why are people going to supermarkets to find love at all? Luke Jones spoke to Shalini
*30:01.760- 30:07.320* :  Kellinghaus, a relationship coach based in Barcelona and Alice Garnett, a journalist who went to Spain
*30:07.320- 30:14.200* :  to give it a go. First, he asked Alice how it all worked. I obviously got myself a trolley. I went
*30:14.200- 30:21.160* :  straight over to the fruit and veg section where I got a pineapple, placed it upside down in my trolley.
*30:21.960- 30:26.620* :  Then there was a couple of other things that you could get to indicate what you were looking for.
*30:26.620- 30:31.440* :  So if you got lentils because they've got a really long shelf life that indicates you're looking
*30:31.440- 30:37.340* :  for something long-term. If you get cucumbers, I'm not going to go into what that means but you can
*30:37.340- 30:43.180* :  read into that what you were. Very wise. And there were other things like chocolate and confectionery
*30:43.180- 30:48.040* :  meant that you were looking for something short but sweet olive oil meant you were looking for someone
*30:48.720- 30:54.520* :  with money like all these different basically whole codes and stuff. So to figure out what to put
*30:54.520- 30:59.960* :  in my trolley. And you tried it. I mean how did it go? Honestly I think I was there on the wrong
*31:00.060- 31:07.080* :  days of the week. Oh no. Yeah so I know that what you mentioned before about the police. I think
*31:07.080- 31:12.480* :  that had happened on like a Thursday or Friday. Which makes sense because in the UK like Thursday's
*31:12.480- 31:18.520* :  a big day for going out for like young professionals whereas you know Sunday, Monday, not so much.
*31:18.520- 31:24.900* :  So I was unlucky I think was my timing. Shilini your relationship coach why are people
*31:24.900- 31:30.500* :  resorting to this? I think it's much like this whole running clip trend that is happening globally as
*31:30.500- 31:34.880* :  well that people are just tired and they're very you know I think we have a pandemic of loneliness
*31:34.880- 31:40.340* :  and mental health issues and people we need visceral experience we need real life experiences we
*31:40.340- 31:45.980* :  need each other and I think people crave interactions and I think it's kind of you know because of
*31:45.980- 31:50.120* :  social media and the pandemic we've kind of gotten a bit yeah isolated and people have lost
*31:50.120- 31:54.720* :  the ability to kind of you know the natural ability to approach each other and yeah so they're
*31:54.720- 31:58.560* :  looking for ways to interact in real life. But we've got all these dating apps for that purpose
*31:58.560- 32:02.700* :  now haven't we why do they need to wander around the local supermarket with bar of chocolate and
*32:02.700- 32:07.660* :  some olive oil in their basket and waiting someone to wink at them? The dating apps are not really
*32:07.660- 32:12.880* :  working for most people it's you know I think it's created an idea of objectifying each other
*32:12.880- 32:18.060* :  objectifying ourselves it's kind of a numbness and and dopamine you know people get dopamine
*32:18.060- 32:22.140* :  kicks out of apps but not so much partners and much of these apps they're also not designed
*32:22.260- 32:26.420* :  for you to find actually someone they're just designed for you to keep be on the app and stay on
*32:26.420- 32:30.980* :  the app so yeah I think it's just not working for people and they just you know maybe dopamine you
*32:30.980- 32:34.620* :  get dopamine hits but you don't get intimacy and they're just craving intimacy and real life
*32:34.620- 32:40.180* :  interactions. The relationship coach Shilini Kellinghouse and before her the journalist Alice
*32:40.180- 32:47.220* :  garnered it on an unusual way of finding love and that's all from us for now but there will be
