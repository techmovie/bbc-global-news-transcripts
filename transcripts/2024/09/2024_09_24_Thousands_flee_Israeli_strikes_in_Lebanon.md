*01:23.520- 01:28.780* :  I'm Andrew Peach, and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday, the 24th of September, these are our main
*01:28.780- 01:29.280* :  headlines.
*01:29.340- 01:34.060* :  The Israeli military and Hezbollah group in Lebanon are continuing cross-border attacks.
*01:34.600- 01:39.860* :  Lebanon's health minister says 558 people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes since
*01:39.860- 01:40.380* :  yesterday.
*01:41.100- 01:45.540* :  Swedish prosecutors accuse Iran of a hack aimed at causing division in Sweden.
*01:47.940- 01:48.700* :  Also, in this podcast,
*01:48.700- 01:53.300* :  it could have so much impact on our future, and the future of the information that the
*01:53.300- 01:55.440* :  public receives in this country.
*01:55.580- 01:59.620* :  What do we know about the secret court battle to determine the future of Rupert Murdoch's
*01:59.620- 02:00.320* :  media empire?
*02:04.140- 02:09.860* :  The Lebanese military says 558 people have been killed since Israel launched airstrikes
*02:09.860- 02:10.740* :  in southern Lebanon.
*02:11.100- 02:12.260* :  50 of them were children.
*02:12.340- 02:16.300* :  Israel says it's targeting Hezbollah and not the Lebanese people.
*02:16.780- 02:20.400* :  But there's no doubt that civilians have been among the casualties and thousands of
*02:20.400- 02:23.280* :  people in southern Lebanon have been forced to flee their homes.
*02:23.920- 02:28.180* :  My colleagues at BBC Arabic spoke to two people who made the journey towards Beirut
*02:28.400- 02:28.980* :  in their cars.
*02:33.460- 02:37.180* :  We all received messages at home, but from different numbers and names.
*02:37.880- 02:41.780* :  The message said that we had to flee our neighborhood because it was close to sites
*02:41.780- 02:44.880* :  that would be hit and close to weapons depots as well.
*02:45.800- 02:50.820* :  In words, the whole of southern Lebanon began to be hit more than a hundred towns were
*02:50.820- 02:52.060* :  rocked by blasts.
*02:52.440- 02:55.700* :  It was a massacre, so we had to flee to save our lives.
*03:01.480- 03:06.160* :  We spent about eight hours on the road from the south to here, from Nabatea, specifically
*03:06.160- 03:06.960* :  to Beirut.
*03:07.760- 03:11.060* :  During those eight hours, we had to stop for 10 or 15 minutes every now and then on
*03:11.060- 03:12.700* :  the road because of the heavy traffic.
*03:13.060- 03:15.760* :  All the way, we heard the sounds of explosions and missiles.
*03:16.380- 03:18.320* :  It was really scary and terrifying.
*03:20.080- 03:24.620* :  A correspondent Nina Sinjab is in Beirut, I'll slain about the journeys people are making.
*03:25.140- 03:31.240* :  It's really a terrible time for many Lebanese here, you know, especially yesterday they spent
*03:31.240- 03:36.880* :  hours and hours trying to take the roads to safe areas to escape the southern part of
*03:36.880- 03:42.080* :  Lebanon towards Northern City, whether in Tear or approaching even nearer to Beirut.
*03:42.380- 03:46.640* :  The government has established at least five schools as shelters here in Beirut.
*03:46.960- 03:51.940* :  Many people are sending out messages of free homes, free housing whenever it's possible
*03:51.940- 03:57.600* :  to receive people and welcome them during this difficult time before everyone knows what's
*03:57.600- 03:58.320* :  going to happen next.
*03:58.320- 04:02.720* :  So it's really a time of emergency, a time of panic for many Lebanese.
*04:02.980- 04:07.260* :  Even here in Beirut today, the streets are empty, schools and universities are closed.
*04:07.740- 04:11.660* :  Many people are staying home, worrying and waiting for what's going to happen next.
*04:11.720- 04:14.200* :  And we're saying earlier, some people know where they're going.
*04:14.200- 04:17.120* :  They're going to stay with a family member or something like that.
*04:17.560- 04:20.300* :  A lot of people making this journey don't really know where they're going.
*04:21.400- 04:23.980* :  That's the reality, thousands and thousands of people.
*04:24.460- 04:29.060* :  They're going to be cramped in shelters, probably in schools like the ones established in
*04:29.060- 04:34.080* :  Beirut or waiting for governments and parties to provide help and aid.
*04:34.460- 04:38.140* :  And don't forget that this is, you know, in a country that is already suffering
*04:38.140- 04:38.800* :  like a crisis.
*04:38.800- 04:44.240* :  There is electricity crisis, people who are going to stay in schools, there is no power,
*04:44.240- 04:46.840* :  there is no hygiene, you know, kids for them.
*04:47.180- 04:52.040* :  So it's really an emergency situation and everyone is rushing to help, but, you know,
*04:52.040- 04:56.380* :  the demand is beyond people's capacity or the government's capacity itself.
*04:56.840- 05:01.040* :  The news is breaking that the Israeli military is saying it's conducted a targeted strike
*05:01.040- 05:05.380* :  in Beirut itself, more details to come as we get them.
*05:05.380- 05:07.720* :  But some people are actually leaving Beirut, aren't they?
*05:07.720- 05:10.400* :  Some people want to be even further away from the border than that.
*05:11.100- 05:15.500* :  There are many people are heading up to the mountain areas trying to escape Beirut.
*05:15.500- 05:20.480* :  Don't forget that it's been a attempts here and past few months, there were sonic boom
*05:20.480- 05:24.720* :  in Beirut repeatedly every single day that people are scared and panicking.
*05:25.220- 05:30.080* :  And now with this approaching and airstrikes happening in Dahye in the south of Beirut
*05:30.280- 05:33.500* :  and it has been a stronghold but also condensed with civilians.
*05:33.900- 05:38.820* :  You also want to escape Beirut and anywhere near a place that could be a target.
*05:38.820- 05:44.780* :  The message from Israel is to draw a distinction between the Lebanese people and Hezbollah,
*05:44.780- 05:48.860* :  the actions against Hezbollah are not the people, but they're also keen to point out
*05:48.860- 05:54.320* :  that some civilians are harboring not only Hezbollah fighters but also Hezbollah weapons in their homes.
*05:54.320- 05:59.860* :  Give us a sense of how widely supported Hezbollah is in southern Lebanon,
*05:59.860- 06:01.100* :  is possible to judge that.
*06:02.860- 06:08.740* :  Well, basically most of the messages coming from Hezbollah community or Hezbollah strongholds
*06:08.740- 06:10.180* :  are in support of Hezbollah.
*06:10.580- 06:15.060* :  Despite the affirmation from families and civilians that they don't want to be dragged
*06:15.060- 06:19.020* :  into a full-fledged war, people want to live normal life.
*06:19.020- 06:21.280* :  They want to work their kids to go to school.
*06:21.280- 06:26.800* :  It's the beginning of the school year now so people don't want to be like living in shelters
*06:26.800- 06:28.940* :  and running away for their own safety.
*06:29.380- 06:34.240* :  However, especially in the last week, people felt that the indiscriminate attacks
*06:34.240- 06:39.140* :  and bombardment taken place by the Israelis have fueled people's anger
*06:39.140- 06:42.460* :  and made them even more supportive for Hezbollah than before.
*06:42.920- 06:45.560* :  Our correspondent, Lena Sinjab from Beirut.
*06:45.560- 06:49.600* :  For the very latest, go to the live page at BBC.com slash news.
*06:49.600- 06:54.400* :  For more on the strategy on both sides of the border, I spoke to our security correspondent,
*06:54.940- 06:55.440* :  Frank Gardner.
*06:56.100- 07:02.140* :  I think Hezbollah's strategy will be to keep its head down and try and survive this
*07:02.520- 07:03.540* :  and then bounce back.
*07:04.080- 07:06.740* :  In other words, what one of survival and resilience?
*07:07.580- 07:12.100* :  It's surprising some people that they haven't unleashed their more powerful weapons.
*07:12.180- 07:13.700* :  There may be several reasons for this.
*07:14.180- 07:16.420* :  Some of them have been destroyed in these air strikes.
*07:17.300- 07:23.780* :  They also know Hezbollah that if they start hitting civilian areas and start inflicting
*07:23.780- 07:27.840* :  major civilian casualties on Israel in the way that Israel is doing on Lebanon,
*07:28.580- 07:33.360* :  then there will be a massive retaliation from Israel that will probably
*07:33.840- 07:37.940* :  destroy Lebanon's infrastructure, including hitting Beirut Airport.
*07:38.440- 07:41.660* :  So there's some restraint there and there's also a possibility that Iran
*07:42.560- 07:48.680* :  is quietly calling on Hezbollah to show restraint because it needs Hezbollah's arsenal
*07:49.420- 07:54.760* :  to remain intact as a deterrent against Israel hitting Iran's nuclear sites.
*07:55.460- 07:59.880* :  So that's one of the sort of arms-length uses that Iran has for Hezbollah.
*08:00.600- 08:06.540* :  But let's not forget, Hezbollah is absolutely reeling from the blows that it suffered in the
*08:06.540- 08:13.020* :  last 10 days. You know, the pager and walkie-talkie explosions, the assassination of senior commanders,
*08:13.060- 08:18.620* :  the slow degrading of its missile capability, the hitting of the Rudwan infantry,
*08:18.620- 08:26.640* :  reading party commanders, but it's still intact and it will, I think, surprise and annoy
*08:26.640- 08:29.560* :  the Israelis as to how resilient it can be.
*08:30.240- 08:35.880* :  If Israel seeks conflict, or at least ends up in conflict with Hezbollah, that's a very different
*08:35.880- 08:40.400* :  thing from being in conflict with Hamas. Hezbollah is a far stronger organization.
*08:41.320- 08:46.000* :  Well, I'm supposed to use the word if because it's been in conflict with Hezbollah since
*08:46.000- 08:52.360* :  October the 8th, the day after the horrific raid into southern Israel by Hamas on October the
*08:52.360- 08:58.000* :  7th. So straight after that, Hezbollah started loving rockets across the border and that
*08:58.000- 09:03.900* :  drove 60,000 plus of Israel's citizens out of their homes and farms and businesses
*09:04.740- 09:08.960* :  further south. They've been putting a lot of pressure on the Israeli government to return.
*09:08.960- 09:16.040* :  So Israel says its vow day now is to clear Hezbollah away from that border, push them back north
*09:16.040- 09:22.500* :  of the Latani river, and so making that northern area of Israel safe. I'm not sure that that's
*09:22.500- 09:29.020* :  going to be possible without a ceasefire agreement that both sides stick to. Doing it by military
*09:29.020- 09:35.500* :  force alone, I think, is going to be very difficult. Israel has an unhappy past in South Lebanon.
*09:35.500- 09:41.960* :  It occupied Lebanon for 18 years, finally pulling out in 2000. It came under constant attack. It
*09:41.960- 09:48.160* :  couldn't domestically sustain the casualties it was taking. And it fought a war, a full-scale war,
*09:48.160- 09:53.720* :  which I think is what you were referring to, really kind of gloves off full-scale war in 2006,
*09:53.720- 10:00.260* :  a 34-day war with Hezbollah, which neither side really won. It ended in conclusively. Both sides
*10:00.260- 10:06.560* :  were hurt, neither side won, and since then Hezbollah has stocked up massively on its huge
*10:06.560- 10:11.680* :  arsenal of weapons far more powerful than anything Hamas has got as you point out.
*10:12.100- 10:17.500* :  Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner. The authorities in Sweden have accused Iran's
*10:17.500- 10:22.180* :  security service of being behind thousands of text messages that were sent to mobile phone
*10:22.180- 10:26.460* :  users, calling for them to take revenge against people who'd burned copies of the Quran.
*10:26.500- 10:32.180* :  Around 15,000 people got the messages last year. Are you a regional editor, Danny Abraham,
*10:32.180- 10:38.680* :  explain what the Swedish prosecutors were saying? They're saying basically a team called the Anzu
*10:38.680- 10:45.820* :  team hacked a text messaging operator in Sweden to send these messages out. And the security
*10:45.820- 10:50.620* :  service in Sweden says that this group was acting on behalf of Iran's revolutionary guard,
*10:50.620- 10:55.800* :  very powerful military organization in Iran. It's very closely connected to the state.
*10:55.800- 11:00.820* :  They've called it an influence operation that was designed essentially to create divisions
*11:00.820- 11:08.240* :  in Swedish society and also to paint Sweden as an Islamophobic country. Now, Sweden in many
*11:08.240- 11:12.880* :  people's eyes is seen as quite a tolerant country, but this was obviously a very controversial phase.
*11:13.460- 11:18.280* :  And they say they know who the hackers are, Andrew, but they've closed the investigation because
*11:18.280- 11:23.620* :  they see it as unlikely that the suspects would either be extradited or prosecuted in Iran.
*11:23.740- 11:28.800* :  Just winding back a step further, why were copies of the Quran burned in this case?
*11:29.460- 11:35.340* :  Well, Sweden has extremely strong constitutional protections for freedom of speech, freedom of
*11:35.340- 11:41.620* :  assembly, freedom of expression, some of the strongest in the world. And so the cases of the
*11:41.620- 11:46.040* :  Quran burning, not just the Quran burning, there were attempts also to burn the Torah, the Jewish
*11:46.040- 11:51.920* :  Holy book and the Bible. But basically what the law says is that there needs to be an extremely
*11:51.920- 11:59.000* :  strong public order reason to ban such demonstrations. And the Swedish government actually criticised
*11:59.000- 12:04.780* :  these burnings and said that they were Islamophobic. And the Swedish police tried to stop
*12:04.780- 12:09.640* :  burnings from taking place. But the Swedish court stepped in and said, no, you don't have sufficient
*12:09.640- 12:15.400* :  justification. The balance of freedom of speech outweighs this. So they're very, very controversial.
*12:15.400- 12:20.680* :  They cause violent protests in places like Indonesia and Pakistan, the Swedish diplomats were
*12:20.680- 12:25.220* :  summoned in the Gulf. And they're also almost threatened to derail on Sweden's application to
*12:25.220- 12:30.420* :  join NATO. Turkey was very angry. A Quran had been burned earlier in the year in front of the
*12:30.420- 12:36.120* :  Turkish embassy. You're a regional editor, Danny Aberhard. A secret court battle in the US to
*12:36.120- 12:40.900* :  determine who will control the future of the media empire owned by Rupert Murdoch has concluded.
*12:41.480- 12:46.080* :  The case is believed to have been born of a rift within the Murdoch family over who will get to
*12:46.080- 12:52.080* :  control Fox News and Newscore when Rupert Murdoch, who's 93, dies. The case could have big
*12:52.080- 12:57.920* :  implications for news outlets that millions of people use. But as the case was held behind closed
*12:57.920- 13:03.400* :  doors, the decision when it comes will also be secret. And North America correspondent Emevadi
*13:03.400- 13:08.780* :  reports from Nevada. He's erratic. He's making bad decisions. If he's not careful, he's going
*13:08.780- 13:12.120* :  to destroy the company. Anyway, you're going to do something. I think I'm the best option.
*13:12.300- 13:17.380* :  The TV drama Succession was inspired by Rupert Murdoch's media family dynasty.
*13:20.440- 13:24.780* :  But now in real life, he's in the middle of a bitter battle with his four adult children.
*13:25.260- 13:29.280* :  Over who will be his successor and take over the media empire when he dies?
*13:31.560- 13:36.700* :  This is Fox News Alert. The 93-year-old owns Newscore and Foxcore, which includes many
*13:36.700- 13:42.180* :  major newspapers and television networks, including the right-wing news outlet Fox News.
*13:42.180- 13:47.480* :  So much of those claims that voter fraud never happens. Of course it happens. They knew it happened.
*13:47.480- 13:53.180* :  The channels given Donald Trump a major platform and in the past has broadcast conspiracy theories
*13:53.180- 14:01.220* :  which have been proven to be false. Rupert Murdoch now reportedly wants to give full control to
*14:01.220- 14:06.020* :  his eldest son, Lacklin, who's believed to share his father's more conservative views.
*14:06.020- 14:10.460* :  Instead of handing equal power over the corporations to the four eldest children,
*14:10.860- 14:14.200* :  who've more liberal views and could take the companies in a different direction.
*14:17.880- 14:21.720* :  So the Murdoch's have descended on the small desert town of Reno, Nevada,
*14:21.720- 14:27.920* :  to resolve the family drama in court. Anytime you have a probate case involving family members,
*14:27.920- 14:34.200* :  the main dynamic that you see is that emotions are involved. It creates honestly the most
*14:34.200- 14:40.200* :  contentious cases. That's Aras Saddam, a probate attorney with experience in family trust cases.
*14:40.460- 14:46.100* :  There's a huge amount on the line here. You have an irrevocable trust which is not usually
*14:46.100- 14:50.700* :  the type of estate planning instrument that people use. They usually use a different kind of trust
*14:51.360- 14:56.180* :  called a revocable trust, which allows them to change it. And here what you have is an irrevocable
*14:56.180- 15:02.380* :  trust that the Rupert Murdoch is attempting to change. In most states, that's very difficult.
*15:02.380- 15:07.920* :  In Nevada, it's a little easier. The Murdoch's have little connection to Nevada but state laws
*15:07.940- 15:13.260* :  allow the hearing to be held in private. We're outside the courthouse here, a place we could
*15:13.260- 15:19.440* :  normally go inside and report from, but the nature of this case is that journalists are essentially
*15:19.440- 15:28.460* :  locked out. So we know very little we have watched the Murdoch family arriving going in very quickly
*15:28.460- 15:34.540* :  out of a convoy of big black cars, but there's not much else to go on.
*15:37.460- 15:41.940* :  Down the road from the courthouse, there's a amusement at a local t-shop that the media family
*15:41.940- 15:47.020* :  dynasty has come to battle for the fortunes of Rupert Murdoch on their doorstep. A lot of the turns
*15:47.100- 15:51.480* :  when these big things happen in the world, you kind of see it as like, oh this happens in another
*15:51.480- 15:57.380* :  place, not at home, not in your town. So definitely like weird for it to be so close.
*15:57.740- 16:02.600* :  I think that it's such a high-stakes trial and the fact that it's being kept so secret
*16:03.220- 16:07.580* :  is kind of shady. It has, it could have so much impact on our future and the future of the
*16:07.580- 16:14.140* :  information that the public receives in this country. Rupert Murdoch's powerful media empires helped
*16:14.140- 16:19.280* :  shape politics and the careers of political leaders around the world and this family relationship
*16:19.280- 16:24.840* :  in future will keep on impacting the type of news that people consume for years to come.
*16:25.740- 16:28.200* :  North America correspondent Imavadi Innebada
*16:29.320- 16:32.540* :  and still to come on the global news podcast. Another species, for example,
*16:32.540- 16:37.180* :  may trade the steel food from the octopus and the octopus can get annoyed with this and roll
*16:37.180- 16:42.120* :  up a chest and punch the individual. How the octopus is leader of the pack underwater.
*16:49.200- 16:52.740* :  Explaining football to the friend who's just there for the nachos? Hard.
*16:53.480- 16:57.140* :  Tailgating from home like a pro with snacks and drinks everyone will love,

*17:28.160- 17:33.500* :  Britbox. Don't miss new seasons of a claimed series like Blue Lights which time at calls
*17:33.500- 17:39.820* :  Belfast answer to the wire. And the responder starring Martin Freeman in his international
*17:39.820- 17:44.540* :  Emmy award winning role. I can feel it. I'm going to crack stream the best of British crime drama
*17:44.540- 17:49.260* :  on Britbox. No, this is why I want to be a detective. Watch with a free trial today.
*17:55.760- 18:00.820* :  President Zelensky says he has a plan for victory against Russia and within days he'll present
*18:00.820- 18:06.160* :  it to his Western backers. It's a key week of diplomacy for the Ukrainian leader as he visits
*18:06.160- 18:11.620* :  the US. Our Europe correspondent Jessica Parker reports now from Kiev on what might be in this
*18:11.620- 18:16.520* :  strategy when the people of Ukraine are prepared to consider concessions to end the war.
*18:19.420- 18:25.000* :  A ballet performance in a theatre in the heart of Ukraine's capital hundreds watch on.
*18:29.580- 18:34.900* :  Life does go on here in Kiev as it does across much of Ukraine but of course the war
*18:34.900- 18:43.520* :  and what's next is very much on people's minds. Demetro is among those I meet outside.
*18:43.520- 18:51.120* :  The soldiers face and lips are badly burnt both arms bandaged up just recently injured fighting
*18:51.120- 18:58.020* :  in Ukraine's east for him there can be no peace while Russia remains in any part of the country.
*18:58.360- 19:05.180* :  We will not surrender our territories for which so many people have fallen.
*19:06.140- 19:09.260* :  If we end the war at this stage what will we fight for?
*19:10.280- 19:12.160* :  Will you go back to the frontline? Will you fight again?
*19:13.620- 19:20.120* :  Of course, of course, my brothers, my comrades are there. I will not retreat. I will be there
*19:20.120- 19:25.600* :  until my last breath. 28-year-old Tatiana's husband is also in the military.
*19:28.500- 19:33.360* :  What do you just victory look like and are you willing to make compromises?
*19:36.060- 19:41.200* :  It's a difficult question to say we will fight to the end until we get back Ramiya's
*19:41.200- 19:46.760* :  heart knowing the sacrifices we are making to get our territories back. But if we stop
*19:46.760- 19:52.720* :  fighting now will this war just repeat itself in ten years time? Will my son then have to fight?
*19:52.940- 19:57.500* :  We are thankful to President Biden by partisan support and thanks to President Zelensky
*19:57.500- 20:03.320* :  who's in the U.S. this week has warned against a frozen conflict and his teams denied that
*20:03.320- 20:09.380* :  their so-called victory plan soon to be handed to President Joe Biden contains any kind of
*20:09.380- 20:15.280* :  partial ceasefire proposal. We're just coming to the offices of the English language
*20:15.280- 20:19.820* :  online newspaper The Key of Independent to meet its editor Olga Rudenko.
*20:20.640- 20:25.760* :  Makes sense, right? Danesky is presenting Biden with a very concrete plan and some people in
*20:25.760- 20:30.700* :  the U.S. who have not supported Ukraine before have said that we'll keep giving money to
*20:30.700- 20:34.920* :  Ukraine but there is no concrete plan so this is the concrete plan. She believes the blueprint
*20:34.920- 20:42.920* :  will contain asks on weapons and future security guarantees but our concessions also up for discussion.
*20:43.700- 20:49.020* :  The idea of a ceasefire, conceding territory, it is a really sensitive conversation in Ukraine
*20:49.020- 20:56.100* :  but realistically do you think that is what Ukraine does have to look at and might actually be looking
*20:56.100- 21:01.760* :  at somewhere in government? Of course, words to ceasefire must fall to round. The conversation
*21:01.760- 21:06.560* :  must be happening somewhere in the government about whether we cannot do this. At the same time
*21:06.560- 21:14.540* :  for the majority of Ukrainians it's still I think too sensitive and unimaginable to concede anything
*21:14.540- 21:23.920* :  even temporarily to Russia. The ballet performance in Kiev centers on a young priest caught
*21:23.920- 21:32.780* :  between a nightmarish dream and reality. President Zelensky sees this week as crucial as he again
*21:32.780- 21:39.100* :  pleased with the West to choose to keep believing in Ukraine because people here will tell you that
*21:39.100- 21:46.340* :  when it comes to fighting Russia's invasion they feel they have no choice. That is their reality.
*21:50.720- 21:56.560* :  Our correspondent Jessica Parker in Kiev. Police in Switzerland have arrested several people after
*21:56.560- 22:03.100* :  a so-called suicide pod was used for the first time. The device is about the size of a coffin and
*22:03.100- 22:08.040* :  allows people to kill themselves by pressing a button. I've found out more from Charlotte Gallagher.
*22:08.940- 22:14.060* :  The death happened on Monday afternoon in a forest close to the German border and there are
*22:14.060- 22:20.540* :  photos of the device surrounded by trees. It looks really space age. It looks really surreal actually
*22:20.540- 22:25.820* :  just to see it in the middle of a forest. An assisted dying organisation says the person who died
*22:25.820- 22:31.580* :  was a 64-year-old woman from the US who traveled to Switzerland to do this. It said she'd been
*22:31.580- 22:37.360* :  suffering for many years from a number of serious problems associated with a severely compromised
*22:37.360- 22:43.640* :  immune system. A Dutch newspaper says that a photographer working for them who'd plan to take
*22:43.640- 22:49.100* :  photos of the pod being used is one of those people being arrested and we think another person
*22:49.100- 22:54.780* :  is possibly from the assisted dying organisation who was there. Now the sarcopod itself dispenses
*22:54.780- 23:01.100* :  a noxious gas when a button is pushed by the user but before they can press that button once they
*23:01.100- 23:06.560* :  get inside they're asked automated questions like do you know who you are and do you know what is
*23:06.560- 23:11.540* :  going to happen when you press this button and the pod has been taken away by the police.
*23:12.760- 23:18.460* :  People travel specifically to Switzerland to end their lives in some circumstances because
*23:18.460- 23:23.700* :  assisted suicide laws are more liberal there than elsewhere. So why are we talking about people
*23:23.700- 23:29.020* :  being arrested? So there are rules governing assisted suicide in Switzerland even though assisted
*23:29.020- 23:35.060* :  suicide is legal as well as these moral and ethical dilemmas and this pod in particular has been
*23:35.060- 23:39.600* :  really controversial in Switzerland this is the first time it's been used. So assisted suicide
*23:39.600- 23:45.180* :  is legal there as long as the action which directly causes death is performed by the person who wants
*23:45.180- 23:51.680* :  to die but if someone helps that person perform the action they can be convicted and go to jail.
*23:52.160- 23:56.360* :  Now the Swiss government have also given a few more details as to why this sarcopod is breaking
*23:56.360- 24:02.360* :  the law they say the product doesn't meet safety requirements and also the gas used is breaching
*24:02.360- 24:07.620* :  the chemicals act but the person who designed this pod essentially wants it to be mass-produced
*24:07.620- 24:13.700* :  and for people who want to use it to be able to. Charlotte Gallagher reporting. Back on the 19th of
*24:13.700- 24:18.820* :  July I was here in this studio about to present a program on the BBC World Service as news of the
*24:18.820- 24:25.840* :  global IT outage began to break starting in Australia and New Zealand. As it spread we wondered if
*24:25.840- 24:30.360* :  we'd get on air at all as much of the Western world came to a standstill planes were grounded
*24:30.360- 24:36.200* :  shops couldn't take payments held services lost their appointment systems. It was all down to a
*24:36.200- 24:42.260* :  40 software update released by the Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. Later one of its senior executives
*24:42.260- 24:47.760* :  is due to answer questions at the US Congress. Let's hear first from one of those affected Joe
*24:47.760- 24:53.580* :  Robertson who lost money after she tried to take her children on holiday. No explanation whatsoever
*24:53.580- 24:58.300* :  everybody was just you know crowding nine people who worked at the airport and they were just like
*24:58.300- 25:04.000* :  we don't know what's going on. I was heartbroken at the end of it actually because I'm putting away
*25:04.000- 25:11.020* :  like £328 each month of my wage and I'm not full-time I'm only part-time you know and then just
*25:11.020- 25:16.880* :  for that £900 just to be gone. I've been talking to our technology editors that we climate
*25:16.880- 25:22.940* :  about the scale of the outage. It affected absolutely millions of people didn't it Angie and
*25:22.960- 25:28.080* :  most of them I think I've probably never heard of the firm CrowdStrike until that day I spent some
*25:28.080- 25:33.140* :  time with Joe yesterday who we just heard from. She'd never heard of them at all you know a fairly
*25:34.220- 25:41.160* :  not exactly a household name of a cyber security firm if use an update overnight and there's
*25:41.160- 25:45.220* :  a fault in its system which means it doesn't realise that there's a fault in the actual update
*25:45.220- 25:50.040* :  and it turns out that this little tiny bit of software reacts very badly with windows
*25:50.040- 25:56.860* :  different computers. Now CrowdStrike doesn't have loads of customers but it has very big ones banks
*25:56.920- 26:03.300* :  airlines and we saw all the chaos that ensued and it kind of followed the sun as people were waking
*26:03.300- 26:09.540* :  up computers and systems were going down sort of one by one weren't they as different time zones
*26:09.540- 26:17.040* :  kind of came online. It was the biggest outage I've ever seen and obviously in those early
*26:17.460- 26:22.400* :  moments we were all thinking you know is this it is this the big cyber attack what is going on
*26:22.400- 26:27.540* :  what on earth has happened here it was it was a frightening morning I think before the details
*26:27.540- 26:33.460* :  unrolled. Do we know what we'll learn from this appearance at Congress today? I think what we can
*26:33.460- 26:40.240* :  expect today is a pretty robust session from US politicians I think they're going to be angry
*26:40.240- 26:45.260* :  but they do want answers they want to understand from CrowdStrike how it happened they want to be
*26:45.260- 26:50.480* :  reassured that number one it won't happen again and number two it hasn't given cyber criminals
*26:50.480- 26:56.080* :  any clever ideas. I have to say I've seen quite a few tech bosses now hold in front of Congress
*26:56.080- 27:01.520* :  over the years that I've been covering the tech beat and I've generally I would say some of the
*27:01.520- 27:05.660* :  politicians that ask the questions understand technology better than others and lots of them
*27:05.660- 27:11.140* :  like the sound of their own voices but they can be pretty ferocious and forensic and rightly so I
*27:11.140- 27:16.580* :  think in this occasion because of the size of the catastrophe that was inadvertently sparked by
*27:16.580- 27:22.020* :  the firm. And has the the sector already learned lessons from what happened either the words
*27:22.220- 27:27.320* :  I suppose I'm saying could this happen again? It's a really tricky one actually Andrew because on
*27:27.320- 27:35.140* :  the one hand in order to be an effective cyber security device then this has to be able to
*27:35.140- 27:39.440* :  access all the bits of a computer doesn't it to find any viruses that are lurking but on the other
*27:39.440- 27:45.400* :  hand in giving it that power it also gives it the possibility for things to go horribly wrong
*27:45.400- 27:50.520* :  when something like this does happen and it's not entirely right. Our technology editor Zoe Kleinman
*27:51.100- 27:56.420* :  a new study has shown the octopus is less of a solitary creature than we thought in fact the
*27:56.420- 28:02.280* :  study by the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior suggests they cooperate with fish to share
*28:02.280- 28:07.860* :  the load when it comes to hunting and not only that they help to organize the hunting expeditions
*28:07.860- 28:12.440* :  and if a fish isn't pulling its weight the octopus might even throw a punch
*28:12.820- 28:17.400* :  Ian Cousin is director of the Department of Collective Behavior at the Max Planck Institute.
*28:18.160- 28:22.900* :  The different species play different roles a species called the goatfish goes out and explores
*28:22.900- 28:27.880* :  and tries to find where food is and it comes back and sort of effectively tells the octopus you know
*28:27.880- 28:33.280* :  I think this food over there another species for example may try to steal food from the octopus and
*28:33.280- 28:38.060* :  the octopus can get annoyed with this and roll up a chest and punch the individual to prevent it
*28:38.060- 28:44.180* :  from stealing food and so the octopus is really utilising the information provided by different
*28:44.180- 28:49.100* :  species but ultimately he or she has more influence than the others about where they go
*28:49.580- 28:54.160* :  and then when they get there the octopus with its unique morphology with those bendy arms can
*28:54.160- 28:59.540* :  go into the coral reef and can pull us out food that can be taken by some of the other species
*29:00.140- 29:05.380* :  the octopus definitely benefits we think some of the fish species benefit but there is some sort
*29:05.380- 29:10.740* :  of tension between them there's a sort of competition as well as operation so if individuals
*29:10.740- 29:16.760* :  become too exploitative then this is when the octopus turns to conflict and punches them to reduce
*29:16.760- 29:21.740* :  that behavior so the octopus kind of regulates it stops individuals from cheating the system.
*29:22.080- 29:25.880* :  I love the idea of the octopus meeting out discipline in the fish community
*29:27.800- 29:31.240* :  and that's all from us for now there'll be a new edition of global news to download later

*30:34.780- 30:40.340* :  conflict raging there we hear from some of the millions of civilians brutalized and displaced
*30:40.420- 30:46.680* :  it's been dubbed the forgotten war but is it more ignored than forgotten by the international
