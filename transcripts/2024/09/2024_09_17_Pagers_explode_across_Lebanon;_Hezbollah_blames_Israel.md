*01:27.980- 01:32.320* :  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Wednesday, the 18th of September. These are our
*01:32.320- 01:39.480* :  main stories. Pages explode across Lebanon. Hezbollah blames Israel. The rapper and producer
*01:39.480- 01:44.220* :  Sean Diddy Combs pleads not guilty to charges of racketeering and sex trafficking.
*01:44.980- 01:50.560* :  Instagram introduces accounts for children aged 13 to 15 to protect them from harmful content.
*01:53.000- 01:58.000* :  Also in this podcast, Scotland agrees to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
*01:58.760- 02:03.660* :  And a whistleblower tells a hearing into the tight and submersible disaster that his warnings about
*02:03.660- 02:09.260* :  safety were ignored. You have to have the confidence in the equipment to do the job. It's like
*02:09.260- 02:14.040* :  every other industry. And did you have confidence in the way that the tide was being built at this time?
*02:14.900- 02:16.460* :  No confidence whatsoever.
*02:20.400- 02:24.480* :  We'll start in Lebanon where several people have been killed and thousands more injured.
*02:24.920- 02:30.620* :  After handheld pages, the sort used by the militant group, Hezbollah, suddenly exploded in
*02:30.620- 02:34.020* :  several locations across the country, leading to shocking scenes.
*02:37.960- 02:45.440* :  Ambulances and cars rush the wounded to hospitals. Lebanon's health ministry are
*02:45.440- 02:50.360* :  as medical staff to report for duty and for people to donate blood. Hezbollah has
*02:50.360- 02:55.000* :  blamed Israel for what it calls criminal aggression. Israel has yet to comment.
*02:55.020- 02:59.840* :  My colleague, James Menendez, spoke to Lebanon's health minister, Dr. Firas Abiyat.
*03:00.060- 03:05.600* :  This all started at half past three this afternoon when a large number of patients started
*03:05.600- 03:11.740* :  presenting to our hospitals. We did complain that their major or communication device exploded.
*03:12.060- 03:19.460* :  And this has resulted in what we are now reporting around 2,800 casualties, including 200
*03:19.460- 03:24.660* :  casualties that are in critical conditions. And up till now, we are reporting nine deaths,
*03:24.880- 03:30.160* :  including an eight year old child. And what sort of injuries to those who were wounded have?
*03:31.180- 03:36.240* :  So most of the injuries appear to be to the face, especially to the eyes, and also to the
*03:36.240- 03:41.220* :  hand with some amputations, whether it's in the hand or finger amputations. And some of them
*03:41.220- 03:47.440* :  have injuries to their flank. And can you tell us are all those who have been injured?
*03:47.440- 03:53.740* :  Are they all members of the militant group Hezbollah or civilians being injured too?
*03:54.140- 03:59.280* :  Well, we're seeing all kinds of people to be honest. And as you know, the vast majority of
*03:59.280- 04:04.440* :  people who are presenting to the emergency rooms are in their civilian clothes. So it's very
*04:04.440- 04:10.420* :  difficult to discern whether they belong to a certain entity like Hezbollah or others.
*04:10.840- 04:16.000* :  But we are seeing that there are, including among them, people who are old or people who are
*04:16.080- 04:21.500* :  very young, likely child that, you know, unfortunately died. And there are some of them who are
*04:21.500- 04:27.660* :  health care workers. Can I just ask you this? I mean, it is 2024 and pages are old technology.
*04:27.660- 04:32.480* :  And we're told that Hezbollah uses them because they're more secure. But do other people in Levin
*04:32.480- 04:39.800* :  and use pages? Well, there are, you know, still in hospitals, some of the hospitals,
*04:39.800- 04:46.300* :  personnel who use pages. But I really cannot comment more on this simply because this is not
*04:46.300- 04:50.860* :  a part that, you know, as from the health sector, we were very much interested in.
*04:51.240- 04:55.180* :  It is though a major security breach for your country, isn't it?
*04:55.780- 05:01.660* :  I think it's a major escalation at the time when everybody was hoping that things are moving
*05:01.660- 05:07.980* :  towards kind of cessation of hostilities or some kind of a ceasefire. This is clearly a move
*05:07.980- 05:14.580* :  in their own direction. Who do you blame for what's happened? Well, I think, you know, the obvious
*05:15.360- 05:23.980* :  culprit has to be the Israelis. But I think that the security people will have more to say on this
*05:23.980- 05:31.240* :  issue. If that is true, though, how worried are you about escalation along Levin and southern
*05:31.240- 05:37.640* :  border with Israel, with all the potential casualties that that might entail? Well, indeed. I mean,
*05:37.640- 05:43.060* :  you know, we in the health sector have been quite worried since day one. And that's why we have
*05:43.060- 05:48.420* :  been holding these drills and preparation for the health sector and Levin and preparing for
*05:48.420- 05:54.380* :  mass casualties that unfortunately we experience today. And Levin is, as everybody knows,
*05:54.380- 06:00.560* :  is passing through multiple crises, including severe financial crisis. So the ability of the healthcare
*06:00.560- 06:08.000* :  sector to bear more stresses is quite concerning. And that is why I really hope that a solution
*06:08.000- 06:14.000* :  towards the escalation, a ceasefire, would be the option that hopefully can lead us out of this
*06:14.000- 06:20.000* :  mess that we're in. Levin and health minister Dr. Ferris Abiyad. So how could this have happened?
*06:20.000- 06:23.980* :  Geetiger and Murphy asked our security correspondent Frank Gardner.
*06:24.320- 06:30.060* :  This operation took two things. It took very precise, timely intelligence to know what this
*06:30.060- 06:34.860* :  batch was, where it was coming from, when it was going where. And secondly, technical capability
*06:34.860- 06:39.980* :  to be able to do this. And the assumption, certainly by Hezbollah, and most of the region is that
*06:39.980- 06:45.460* :  Israel, which is not commenting, was behind this because there is form here. Back in 1996,
*06:45.460- 06:51.760* :  they were able to assassinate a leading Hamas bomb maker called Yahya Yash. I speak into experts
*06:51.760- 06:56.540* :  about it and they think that the most likely explanation is that somebody was able to insert
*06:56.540- 07:02.520* :  themselves into the supply chain and insert between 10 to 20 grams of military grade high
*07:02.520- 07:10.660* :  explosive, probably HMX or RDX, into these pages disguised or hidden inside a fake electrical
*07:10.660- 07:15.520* :  component. That would then have been triggered or armed rather by what's called an alpha
*07:15.520- 07:21.380* :  numeric signal, sent to these one-way pages. So the pages receive messages, but they don't send
*07:21.380- 07:26.740* :  them. They're pages, not mobile phones. And Hezbollah told its people don't use mobile phones.
*07:26.740- 07:31.200* :  They're too dangerous. Have these instead. They turn out to have been just as dangerous. But the
*07:31.200- 07:37.840* :  amount of explosive in them, in 99% plus of the cases, wasn't fatal. This is a warning. This is
*07:38.200- 07:44.220* :  a psychological blow against Hezbollah, which must be hugely undermining to their morale and their
*07:44.700- 07:48.940* :  ability to conduct operations. They must be thinking, what else is compromised by this?
*07:49.060- 07:52.360* :  I just want to bring in another guest who's just managed to join his followers, judges,
*07:52.780- 07:57.100* :  for us, of international relations at the LSC. Thank you so much for being with us as far as.
*07:57.340- 08:05.440* :  Just your response in terms of this extraordinary attack, what do you think it means for all parties?
*08:06.560- 08:12.260* :  Well, I think it's one of the greatest security breach of Hezbollah. Hezbollah communication
*08:12.260- 08:19.540* :  system. Hezbollah command and control. The number of casualties is vast, almost 2,700.
*08:19.580- 08:25.660* :  I can expect now there is a lot of chaos within the decision-making process. I don't think we're
*08:25.660- 08:31.520* :  going to expect any major retaliation in the next hours or next few days. Hezbollah will most likely
*08:31.520- 08:38.300* :  take its time, assess the implications. I can imagine now there's a great deal of volatility,
*08:38.300- 08:44.720* :  a great deal of chaos within the decision-making process, because this particular vast breach
*08:44.720- 08:51.100* :  basically targets the nerve center, the decision-making process of Hezbollah. But my take on it is
*08:51.100- 08:57.540* :  that Hezbollah faces some very big strategic dilemma, because while Hezbollah feels bound
*08:57.540- 09:02.860* :  to retaliate, Hezbollah also does not really want to trigger all out war. Because Hezbollah
*09:02.860- 09:09.960* :  assessment, I take it that this is the first shot in the Israel's all-out war against Hezbollah.
*09:10.180- 09:15.380* :  Israel really has been provoking Hezbollah, has been pushing Hezbollah, and this attacks really,
*09:15.380- 09:22.680* :  it's not just a psychological attack. This is a major security catastrophic attack on Hezbollah.
*09:23.040- 09:28.100* :  So I think Hezbollah leaders will basically take their time, will assess their options.
*09:28.100- 09:33.740* :  But at the same time, I doubt very much whether Hezbollah's attack will target any kind of civilians
*09:33.740- 09:39.240* :  in Israel, because Hezbollah has been really avoiding targeting Israeli civilians because Hezbollah,
*09:39.240- 09:44.700* :  the strategic, the overarching strategic aim of Hezbollah is to avoid all out war.
*09:44.980- 09:49.680* :  Because both Iran and Hezbollah believe that Israel is trying to drag them to all out war,
*09:49.680- 09:53.820* :  not only against Israel, but also against the United States and each Western Allies
*09:53.820- 09:59.780* :  who have a massive armada nearby. If it is Israel, it's an extraordinary operation as we've
*09:59.780- 10:05.580* :  been saying by them, Frank, where do you think the sleeves the region now? And what do you think
*10:05.580- 10:12.840* :  about the timing? I mean, Russian Shogu is, I think, visiting Iran today. The US envoy was in
*10:12.840- 10:17.420* :  the region yesterday. We've got a US election coming up in weeks. It's so volatile.
*10:17.500- 10:21.860* :  There's a lot of moving parts here, but I think rather as far as Jerkis mentioned there,
*10:22.400- 10:27.680* :  the whole struggle, the whole confrontation that has gone on for a long time between Hezbollah
*10:28.200- 10:33.680* :  and Iran on one side and Israel on the other, is a very calibrated struggle. Both sides
*10:33.680- 10:39.720* :  don't want to go to a full-scale war. Israel's interest is to push Hezbollah back north of the
*10:39.720- 10:45.220* :  Latani river and stop the attacks on its own civilians and citizens on the Israeli side of that
*10:45.220- 10:51.000* :  border. It suits Iran to have Hisbalah needle Israel by these constant little attacks,
*10:51.000- 10:57.140* :  but not so much that it provokes a full-scale war, which, as he says, would be devastating for Lebanon.
*10:57.140- 11:02.920* :  Lebanon's economy is already on its knees. The country is absolutely hobbled by one disaster
*11:02.920- 11:08.140* :  after another. And ordinary Lebanese are saying to Hezbollah, please don't start a war with Israel.
*11:08.140- 11:12.880* :  We can't take it. We don't want to see our buildings, our bridges, our hospitals destroyed in
*11:12.880- 11:17.940* :  a massive, great big Israeli air campaign, but Israel at the same time is under pressure from its
*11:17.940- 11:24.000* :  own citizens to push Hezbollah back from the border so that it's 60,000 citizens can return to
*11:24.000- 11:28.660* :  their homes, their farms, and their businesses. And it's beginning to run out of patients.
*11:29.200- 11:34.280* :  And unless there is some kind of a peace deal, whether it's Shoigu or the UN or whoever
*11:34.300- 11:40.240* :  somehow mock heads together and get some kind of a peace deal, which looks unlikely, unless that
*11:40.240- 11:45.780* :  happens, I think there is an increasing risk of a larger conflagration in that region.
*11:46.200- 11:50.480* :  The BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner, we also heard there from Fowers Gurgers,
*11:50.480- 11:54.540* :  Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics.
*11:55.800- 12:01.180* :  The American music star, Sean Diddy Combs, has been taken into custody after pleading not guilty
*12:01.180- 12:05.100* :  to sex trafficking and other charges at a federal court in New York.
*12:05.620- 12:10.540* :  The rapper, one of the biggest names in hip hop since the 1990s, was arrested late on Monday,
*12:10.540- 12:15.860* :  and the indictment against him was released early on Tuesday. Here's New York prosecutor Damian
*12:15.860- 12:21.120* :  Williams, outlining the allegations. The indictment alleges that combs abuse and exploited women
*12:21.120- 12:27.160* :  and other people for years, and in a variety of ways. As alleged, combs use force, threats of
*12:27.440- 12:33.920* :  coercion to cause victims to engage in extended sexual performances with male commercial sex workers,
*12:34.460- 12:39.940* :  some of whom he transported or caused to be transported over state lines. Combs allegedly planned
*12:40.440- 12:44.100* :  and controlled the sex performances, which he called free-goffs.
*12:44.720- 12:49.020* :  Sean Combs' legal team say he's innocent and that appear against the decision to hold him
*12:49.020- 12:55.040* :  without bail pending his trial. Here's his lawyer, Michael Agnifolio. Mr. Combs is a fighter.
*12:55.660- 13:00.600* :  He's going to fight this to the end. He's innocent. He came to New York to establish his
*13:00.600- 13:05.120* :  innocence. He's not afraid. He's not afraid of the charges. There's nothing that the government
*13:05.120- 13:12.100* :  said in their presentation today that changes anyone's mind about anything. He's been looking forward
*13:12.100- 13:16.420* :  to this day. He's been looking forward to clearing his name, and he's going to clear his name.
*13:17.060- 13:20.100* :  Data traffic is our correspondent in New York, who's following the case.
*13:20.700- 13:26.700* :  Sean P. Diddy Combs has been charged with racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation
*13:26.700- 13:32.400* :  of prostitution, and essentially the kind of overall charges is that he used his business as
*13:32.400- 13:40.480* :  a criminal enterprise. He used his staff alongside his wealth to transport women as well as male
*13:40.480- 13:47.840* :  sex workers across state lines to record sexual performances that he referred to as free-goffs,
*13:47.840- 13:55.100* :  and he would coerce these women to engage in sexual activity for days, giving them drugs,
*13:55.800- 14:02.040* :  such as cocaine and ketamine, recording the sexual activities, and using it as collateral
*14:02.140- 14:10.220* :  to make sure that they remained silent. And they say that this was pervasive abuse for decades.
*14:10.380- 14:17.540* :  He also resorted to attempts at kidnapping and arson to make sure that he wasn't caught.
*14:17.880- 14:22.140* :  And the last couple of hours we've learned that the judges decided not to give him bail. Why?
*14:22.140- 14:28.480* :  Sean Combs did plead not guilty in court. His lawyers argued that the sexual activity
*14:28.480- 14:33.180* :  described in the indictment was all consensual, and that he should be kept in home detention.
*14:33.260- 14:39.960* :  But prosecutors essentially said that he was a flight risk, that given his vast wealth as a billionaire,
*14:39.960- 14:46.740* :  he couldn't be trusted to stay and not try to flee. They also detailed their
*14:46.740- 14:51.020* :  in allegations that he had tried to tamper with witnesses and obstruct justice.
*14:51.020- 14:56.200* :  And they said because he was a serial abuser, he remained a threat to the community. They say they
*14:56.640- 15:02.420* :  found a pink substance in his hotel where they arrested him, which they believe was drugs.
*15:02.420- 15:07.200* :  And so they said that he should be held in detention for the safety of the community,
*15:07.200- 15:10.900* :  and the judge essentially sided with prosecutors here.
*15:11.120- 15:13.100* :  What sort of sentence could he be facing, do you think?
*15:13.460- 15:17.400* :  Look, it's a mandatory minimum of a 15-year prison sentence,
*15:17.400- 15:23.520* :  but it goes all the way up to life behind bars if he's convicted of all three of these
*15:23.520- 15:31.080* :  incredibly serious counts. And this case is really kind of similar, I would say, to that of
*15:31.080- 15:36.360* :  Arkelli, another trial that I covered. Arkelli was facing similar charges.
*15:36.880- 15:41.740* :  And Arkelli and two trials in New York and Chicago got a combined sentence of 30 years in prison.
*15:42.400- 15:46.500* :  So prosecutors arguing that they have mountains of evidence to prove his guilt.
*15:46.500- 15:51.000* :  They say during two raids on his homes in Miami and Los Angeles in March,
*15:51.000- 15:57.540* :  that they uncovered many electronic devices, over 90, that they had footage of these so-called
*15:57.580- 16:03.060* :  freakoffs that they had interviewed dozens and dozens of witnesses, and that they feel confident
*16:03.060- 16:08.040* :  in their case. Another topic with me from New York. We've been hearing in the last few days
*16:08.040- 16:13.300* :  on the podcast about the devastating floods in Central and Eastern Europe. Over the summer,
*16:13.300- 16:17.600* :  hurricanes and cyclones have battered North America and parts of Southeast Asia,
*16:18.020- 16:21.740* :  and countries across Africa have also been suffering drought and severe rains.
*16:22.520- 16:26.440* :  Some farmers in Malawi have found a novel way to rescue their banana crops,
*16:27.020- 16:31.760* :  by turning their overripe fruit into wine, and Akubu has the story.
*16:35.200- 16:38.620* :  Emily is clear and read from her once thriving banana plantation.
*16:42.280- 16:47.120* :  A severe heatwave has turned most of her harvest into scot soil and dried up leaves.
*16:49.140- 16:53.100* :  It is said that we have to go through all this waste, the heat here is unbearable,
*16:53.300- 16:55.860* :  all our hard work and investment is lost.
*17:00.760- 17:05.060* :  Extreme weather events in Karonga district, North and Malawi have become more frequent.
*17:05.660- 17:09.980* :  Farmers here face a challenging mix of harsh heat and intense rain.
*17:11.340- 17:16.580* :  So instead of throwing away overripe bananas, Emily and her colleagues have put them to better use.
*17:19.280- 17:21.440* :  The use of a ripe bananas to make wine.
*17:22.580- 17:28.380* :  Bananas are selected, peeled, sweetened and doused in yeast and lemons to preserve taste.
*17:29.040- 17:30.940* :  They are then fermented to make wine.
*17:32.660- 17:36.020* :  Tennyson Gondwe is the CEO of Comcept Cooperative Union,
*17:36.380- 17:39.140* :  which has been helping women venture into this business.
*17:50.980- 17:55.580* :  Banana wine has proved a success in neighboring markets, in Tanzania and Rwanda,
*17:56.120- 17:57.640* :  but what about here in Malawi?
*17:58.720- 18:02.000* :  Back at the farm, wine makers have a taste of their labor.
*18:03.100- 18:05.340* :  This is very sweet wine.
*18:05.620- 18:07.680* :  You need to be seated to enjoy the flavours.
*18:07.680- 18:11.680* :  We don't want to drink wine, we don't want to drink wine.
*18:12.980- 18:16.680* :  Adapting to climate change is a tough challenge for farmers around the world,
*18:17.140- 18:20.260* :  but as the farming community in this part of Malawi can testify,
*18:20.860- 18:22.620* :  there can be alternative solutions.
*18:26.860- 18:32.020* :  Now still to come in this podcast, Ecuador's new president says he wants U.S. forces back on its
*18:32.020- 18:34.280* :  soil to help fight drugs gangs.
*18:34.780- 18:38.740* :  And we will take those non-reproductive animals and move them
*18:38.800- 18:41.160* :  where the temperature was a little bit more stable.
*18:41.460- 18:45.960* :  And about six months down the line, they are mating and laying eggs.
*18:46.220- 18:50.540* :  Our scientists are getting endangered shellfish in Florida to find a mate.
*19:00.220- 19:03.240* :  Explaining football to the friend who's just there for the nachos?
*19:03.760- 19:08.380* :  Hard. Tailgating from home like a pro with snacks and drinks everyone will love,
*19:08.940- 19:09.800* :  any easy win.
*19:10.200- 19:13.440* :  And with Instacart helping deliver the snack time MVP's to your door,

*19:34.820- 19:38.640* :  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, honestly, when I started this,
*19:38.640- 19:40.240* :  I thought I'd only have to do like four of these.
*19:40.460- 19:43.720* :  I mean, it's unlimited premium wireless for $15 a month.
*19:43.820- 19:46.760* :  How are there still people paying two or three times that much?
*19:47.340- 19:48.820* :  I'm sorry, I shouldn't be victim blaming here.

*19:58.000- 20:00.840* :  Taxes and fees extra. Speed slower about 40 gigabyte seat details.
*20:05.720- 20:11.220* :  The social media giant Meta has announced new restrictions on Instagram for 13 to 15-year-olds.
*20:11.460- 20:14.980* :  There'll be new teen accounts for new joiners, although critics say
*20:14.980- 20:17.980* :  those already on the platform will likely slip through the net.
*20:18.400- 20:20.160* :  Here's our correspondent, Angus Crawford.
*20:20.680- 20:22.420* :  The first thing is it's going to start immediately.
*20:22.460- 20:25.260* :  It's extraordinary as if Meta was in a real hurry.
*20:25.260- 20:28.780* :  First of all, what's going to happen is new users signing up today
*20:28.780- 20:32.400* :  will automatically default to a teen account.
*20:32.400- 20:33.640* :  There's new teen account.
*20:33.800- 20:34.980* :  Now, why is that important?
*20:34.980- 20:36.080* :  Well, there's new teen account.
*20:36.200- 20:37.820* :  Apparently, it will be locked down.
*20:37.820- 20:40.120* :  That means the status will be private by default.
*20:40.120- 20:42.020* :  There'll be restrictions on messaging.
*20:42.020- 20:43.020* :  Who you can message.
*20:43.520- 20:45.540* :  Restrictions on content you can see.
*20:46.020- 20:48.460* :  And the time that you can use the app.
*20:48.520- 20:51.840* :  Now, what's also interesting is 16 and 17-year-olds
*20:52.020- 20:53.900* :  will be able to turn off those restrictions.
*20:53.900- 20:57.300* :  But for the first time, 13 to 15-year-olds,
*20:57.600- 21:01.260* :  they'll need parental permission to turn off those features.
*21:01.640- 21:03.860* :  And that's really interesting, because that will engage then
*21:04.380- 21:07.180* :  much more parental oversight of what they're doing.
*21:07.180- 21:09.960* :  And it means that parents will have access to information about
*21:10.440- 21:12.620* :  who they're messaging, what content they're looking at.
*21:12.900- 21:17.120* :  And they will also be able to set things like time as on when young people
*21:17.120- 21:19.940* :  can look at this kind of content.
*21:19.940- 21:21.680* :  Now, what's really interesting as well,
*21:22.340- 21:25.180* :  the migration for those who are already on the app,
*21:25.240- 21:26.680* :  the under-18s already on the app,
*21:26.680- 21:28.960* :  that starts next week and will be a process
*21:28.960- 21:30.720* :  that should continue across the world
*21:30.720- 21:33.960* :  and may be completed, they say, by about Christmas.
*21:34.640- 21:35.920* :  Hang on, though. I've got teenagers.
*21:36.200- 21:39.540* :  All they're going to do is lie about when they were born.
*21:39.660- 21:41.280* :  Isn't it? And claim they're older than they are.
*21:41.760- 21:44.940* :  This is exactly the problem that campaigners have pointed out.
*21:45.160- 21:46.640* :  Two problems on age verification.
*21:46.640- 21:48.480* :  Number one, those already on the app.
*21:48.800- 21:50.880* :  We all know plenty of teenagers, they simply lied
*21:50.880- 21:52.080* :  when they first went on the app.
*21:52.080- 21:54.280* :  So they could be on the app now at 14,
*21:54.280- 21:56.180* :  claiming they joined when they were 20.
*21:56.480- 21:57.220* :  So that's a real problem.
*21:57.340- 21:59.400* :  And there's actually some really interesting research on that,
*21:59.400- 22:04.240* :  which shows that something like 65% of nine to 12-year-olds
*22:04.240- 22:07.220* :  who shouldn't be on the app at all already have an Instagram account.
*22:07.260- 22:08.380* :  So that's a big problem.
*22:08.380- 22:12.000* :  How are we going to go back and age verify those young people
*22:12.000- 22:14.280* :  who are on the app and shouldn't have been on the app
*22:14.320- 22:15.540* :  and have lied about their age?
*22:15.540- 22:17.820* :  So that's number one. Number two, new users.
*22:18.220- 22:20.120* :  There's got to be some really good age verification
*22:20.240- 22:21.800* :  on the new users signing up.
*22:21.800- 22:24.040* :  And what's really interesting is, you know,
*22:24.040- 22:27.100* :  that has come in for a lot of criticism about age verification.
*22:27.240- 22:30.340* :  So what is it going to do today about age verification
*22:30.400- 22:31.560* :  that it wasn't doing yesterday?
*22:31.560- 22:32.300* :  It's a really good point.
*22:32.820- 22:33.920* :  Angus Crawford reporting.
*22:34.720- 22:36.440* :  A former director at Ocean Gates,
*22:36.440- 22:38.540* :  the company who's tight and submersible,
*22:38.540- 22:41.880* :  imploded last year during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic,
*22:42.440- 22:45.360* :  says he had no confidence in how the vessel was being built.
*22:46.100- 22:49.380* :  David Lockridge has told a US Coast Guard hearing into the incident
*22:49.380- 22:52.920* :  that his safety warnings were ignored by Ocean Gates CEO,
*22:53.380- 22:54.060* :  Stockton Rush.
*22:54.680- 22:57.620* :  Mr Rush was one of five people killed by the implosion.
*22:58.060- 23:00.940* :  Our science editor Rebecca Morrell was watching proceedings.
*23:01.620- 23:04.740* :  This is the first time that David Lockridge has spoken publicly
*23:04.740- 23:06.360* :  about his time at Ocean Gates.
*23:06.380- 23:11.040* :  The former Royal Navy engineer was employed from 2015 to 2018
*23:11.040- 23:13.020* :  while the Titan sub was being developed.
*23:13.640- 23:16.360* :  He told the hearing that his job was to oversee safety.
*23:16.640- 23:19.840* :  You have to have the confidence in the equipment to do the job.
*23:19.840- 23:21.640* :  It's like every other industry.
*23:22.120- 23:24.240* :  If you don't have the confidence in it, you don't do it.
*23:24.580- 23:24.960* :  That's it.
*23:25.560- 23:28.040* :  Indeed, you have confidence in the way that the Titan was being built
*23:28.040- 23:28.560* :  at this time?
*23:29.320- 23:30.900* :  No confidence whatsoever.
*23:31.500- 23:33.940* :  And I was very vocal about that and still am.
*23:34.160- 23:36.000* :  He told the hearing he'd warned Ocean Gates
*23:36.000- 23:37.460* :  about significant problems.
*23:38.220- 23:40.900* :  These included a viewport that was only deemed safe
*23:40.900- 23:43.740* :  to 1,300 metres by its manufacturer,
*23:43.740- 23:47.480* :  but the sub was diving three times deeper to get to the Titanic.
*23:48.240- 23:50.400* :  He also said the material the sub was made of,
*23:50.400- 23:52.920* :  carbon fiber was of such poor quality
*23:53.300- 23:56.820* :  that he could shine a torch through a five-inch thick sample of it.
*23:57.520- 24:00.800* :  Several times he described Titan as an abomination of a sub.
*24:00.940- 24:02.780* :  At the end of the day, safety comes first
*24:02.820- 24:04.320* :  than any time you're going on a sub.
*24:04.740- 24:07.400* :  Most important thing is going home safety of families.
*24:07.920- 24:10.200* :  Yes, you're taking a risk, going down the submersible,
*24:10.200- 24:14.340* :  but don't take risks that are unnecessary with faulty
*24:14.340- 24:16.860* :  and I mean faulty, deficient equipment.
*24:17.160- 24:19.820* :  Mr. Lockridge was fired after raising these concerns.
*24:19.900- 24:22.660* :  The hearings will continue for the next two weeks.
*24:23.300- 24:26.060* :  It's 15 years since US soldiers left Ecuador
*24:26.060- 24:28.220* :  and handed control of their base in Manter
*24:28.220- 24:30.940* :  on the Pacific coast to the Ecuadorian authorities.
*24:31.800- 24:34.860* :  Since then, powerful armed gangs and transnational drugs
*24:34.860- 24:37.020* :  cartels have become a huge problem.
*24:37.700- 24:40.000* :  And that's why the new president, Daniel Naboa,
*24:40.220- 24:41.620* :  wants to change the constitution
*24:41.620- 24:44.940* :  to allow foreign military bases to operate in Ecuador again.
*24:45.680- 24:48.380* :  Rebecca Kesby spoke to Otto Rahman-Somenholzer,
*24:48.580- 24:50.040* :  who was vice president of Ecuador
*24:50.040- 24:52.360* :  between 2018 and 2020.
*24:52.360- 24:55.500* :  Did he think allowing foreign military involvement in the country
*24:55.820- 24:56.600* :  was a good idea?
*24:57.060- 24:58.320* :  Politically, it is.
*24:58.640- 25:00.680* :  And you have elections coming soon, next February.
*25:01.040- 25:02.520* :  And you have a government that is having issues
*25:02.520- 25:04.040* :  to keep up its popularity.
*25:04.560- 25:05.940* :  In terms of solving the violence,
*25:06.400- 25:08.920* :  it's not about having military personnel.
*25:09.340- 25:10.580* :  It's presence in the country.
*25:11.140- 25:13.860* :  It's more about having access to technology and equipment.
*25:14.480- 25:16.780* :  That's why I say that all cooperation is welcome
*25:16.780- 25:18.300* :  from the US or from anywhere.
*25:18.920- 25:22.300* :  We do have the military personnel that is trained
*25:22.300- 25:23.880* :  and that is ready for the fight
*25:23.880- 25:26.000* :  and the police personnel as well.
*25:26.640- 25:29.120* :  But we do need equipment for intelligence,
*25:29.120- 25:31.760* :  for logistics, for air control.
*25:32.260- 25:33.820* :  And that equipment is expensive.
*25:34.200- 25:37.380* :  So what we normally get from cooperating countries
*25:38.000- 25:40.240* :  is, I don't know, secondhand equipment,
*25:40.900- 25:42.860* :  stuff that they are not really using.
*25:42.860- 25:46.740* :  That doesn't involve having or not having military bases.
*25:46.980- 25:49.180* :  I don't think you lose any sovereignty
*25:49.560- 25:51.880* :  as the opposition to the government would say
*25:52.420- 25:53.580* :  if you have military bases.
*25:54.000- 25:55.780* :  I don't think that it's necessary.
*25:56.060- 25:58.380* :  That's only, I don't think that it's what we need right now.
*25:58.380- 25:59.540* :  What we need right now is equipment,
*25:59.980- 26:01.120* :  help, intelligence.
*26:01.740- 26:03.000* :  Listen, helping money laundry.
*26:03.500- 26:05.640* :  Most of the, or many of the gangs
*26:05.640- 26:07.480* :  are laundering their money also abroad.
*26:08.000- 26:10.360* :  In 2009, when President Correa decided
*26:10.360- 26:12.760* :  to expel the American base from Manta,
*26:13.000- 26:15.420* :  Ecuador lost its operational capabilities
*26:15.420- 26:17.220* :  to control its maritime space.
*26:17.820- 26:20.400* :  And it didn't replace that air surveillance
*26:20.400- 26:22.360* :  of the Pacific Ocean with anything.
*26:22.740- 26:26.880* :  In 2019, without having to bring back foreign bases,
*26:27.600- 26:30.260* :  we recovered the control of the air space
*26:30.260- 26:31.300* :  on the Pacific Ocean.
*26:31.900- 26:35.940* :  With that, the increase of the seizures of cocaine
*26:36.900- 26:37.780* :  was exponential.
*26:38.180- 26:40.500* :  But also when you increase the capture of drugs,
*26:41.000- 26:42.220* :  you have violence rising.
*26:42.380- 26:43.780* :  And that's where Ecuador is right now.
*26:44.080- 26:46.700* :  Well, you say it's politically popular.
*26:47.100- 26:50.580* :  And I guess that's because of the grip the countries in
*26:51.020- 26:54.640* :  from the gangs and the drug cartels and so on.
*26:54.640- 26:58.460* :  I mean, we've had huge prison breaks just this year.
*26:58.460- 27:02.580* :  We had a television station taken over earlier
*27:02.580- 27:04.020* :  on this year as well.
*27:04.020- 27:07.660* :  And people in Ecuador are absolutely terrified
*27:07.660- 27:11.180* :  of these armed groups and the grip they have in the country.
*27:11.680- 27:16.700* :  Yeah, Ecuador went from having around six violent deaths
*27:16.700- 27:20.660* :  every 100,000 citizens to around 50 last year.
*27:21.340- 27:23.380* :  So it's also an exponential increase.
*27:23.640- 27:25.740* :  The more drugs you capture, the harder you fight,
*27:25.740- 27:28.040* :  drug gangs, the more violence you have.
*27:28.500- 27:29.480* :  So it's a hard choice.
*27:29.840- 27:31.480* :  As a leader, as a government, it's a hard choice.
*27:31.940- 27:32.780* :  You have to make one.
*27:33.160- 27:35.340* :  This is a transnational and multinational problem.
*27:35.660- 27:36.240* :  Drug trafficking.
*27:36.240- 27:37.860* :  It's not an Ecuador-only problem.
*27:38.600- 27:40.820* :  And all help you can get from any country that really
*27:40.820- 27:42.160* :  wants to help must be welcome.
*27:42.340- 27:43.420* :  And I think that's positive.
*27:44.040- 27:45.880* :  But then having foreign bases in Ecuador
*27:45.880- 27:47.000* :  will be part of the solution.
*27:47.000- 27:48.080* :  I'm not sure about that.
*27:48.480- 27:51.660* :  The 2026 Commonwealth Games were supposed to be held
*27:51.660- 27:53.500* :  in the Australian state of Victoria.
*27:54.000- 27:56.580* :  But officials there pulled out because of spiraling costs.
*27:57.300- 27:59.500* :  Now, the Scottish government has agreed a deal
*27:59.500- 28:02.160* :  that will bring the games to Glasgow just 12 years
*28:02.160- 28:04.240* :  after the city last hosted the event.
*28:04.820- 28:07.260* :  Our Scotland correspondent, Catcher and a Renton reports.
*28:13.160- 28:15.520* :  The opening ceremony for the Commonwealth Games
*28:15.520- 28:19.220* :  in Glasgow 2014 was a spectacular event
*28:19.220- 28:21.840* :  marking the beginning of a summer to remember.
*28:22.680- 28:25.940* :  Glasgow 2026 has been given the green light
*28:25.940- 28:29.560* :  by the Scottish government, but it will be a much scaled down affair.
*28:30.240- 28:33.520* :  After the Australian state of Victoria pulled out last year,
*28:33.900- 28:36.840* :  Commonwealth Games Scotland suggested Glasgow could rescue
*28:36.840- 28:40.860* :  the 2026 games using existing infrastructure and venues.
*28:40.940- 28:45.460* :  The cost for 2014 was £543 million.
*28:45.740- 28:50.120* :  The budget for this game is set to be about £114 million.
*28:50.540- 28:54.640* :  Crucial to the decision and assurance that no public money
*28:54.640- 28:56.600* :  will be provided by the Scottish government.
*28:56.600- 28:59.960* :  There will be 10 core sports at Glasgow 2026
*28:59.960- 29:04.860* :  that were 17 in 2014, and only four venues will be used
*29:05.200- 29:07.520* :  as opposed to 14 a decade ago.
*29:08.100- 29:10.900* :  The proposal will now go to the Commonwealth Games federation
*29:10.900- 29:13.360* :  for consideration, but this seems a formality.
*29:13.920- 29:17.340* :  It's hoped the legacy from this game will be a paired back model
*29:17.640- 29:19.880* :  that is more attractive for places to host.
*29:20.360- 29:23.780* :  The cost and organisational challenges associated with the event
*29:23.780- 29:25.740* :  means it's hard to find willing hosts,
*29:26.340- 29:28.840* :  so how bright does the future look for the Commonwealth Games?
*29:29.400- 29:31.640* :  Is our sports news correspondent Laura Scott?
*29:32.460- 29:34.900* :  For now, the Commonwealth Games has been given a lifeline,
*29:34.960- 29:37.680* :  but many will be wondering how much longer it can survive,
*29:37.680- 29:40.280* :  given the difficulties faced in finding a host
*29:40.280- 29:42.760* :  and scrutiny around the relevance of the Commonwealth.
*29:42.780- 29:47.700* :  The UK and Australia have held every edition of the Commonwealth Games this century,
*29:48.040- 29:50.020* :  apart from the 2010 Games in Delhi,
*29:50.560- 29:52.600* :  and there is currently no host for 2030
*29:52.600- 29:54.900* :  after Alberta pulled out last year.
*29:55.400- 29:57.200* :  But there is confidence among organisers
*29:57.200- 29:59.580* :  that by resetting and refreshing the format
*29:59.980- 30:01.300* :  and cutting the number of sports,
*30:01.760- 30:04.400* :  a more diverse group of nations will find it an appealing
*30:04.400- 30:06.400* :  and affordable prospect to host.
*30:06.980- 30:09.520* :  Organisers have already warned the cycling road race
*30:09.520- 30:12.120* :  and the marathon are likely to be cut in Glasgow
*30:12.620- 30:15.340* :  with more difficult decisions to be taken in the coming weeks.
*30:15.340- 30:18.620* :  However, they promise it will still be a world-class event
*30:18.620- 30:21.100* :  and that a new model can breathe fresh life
*30:21.100- 30:24.060* :  into the Commonwealth Games as its centenary approaches.
*30:24.620- 30:27.500* :  Now it's being called speed dating for shellfish.
*30:28.120- 30:30.100* :  The shallow waters around the Florida Keys
*30:30.100- 30:32.900* :  get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter
*30:33.300- 30:35.460* :  for the endangered Queen Conte to reproduce.
*30:36.260- 30:38.800* :  But the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission
*30:38.800- 30:42.900* :  has a plan to save the species by moving more than 200 conscious
*30:42.900- 30:46.480* :  to cooler deeper waters to try to kickstart their sex drive
*30:46.480- 30:50.460* :  as all the conways been hearing from research scientist Gabriel Delgado.
*30:50.920- 30:53.100* :  We will take those non-reproductive animals
*30:53.100- 30:55.260* :  that don't contribute to future generations
*30:55.400- 30:59.660* :  and move them into aggregations offshore on the reef track
*30:59.660- 31:03.140* :  where the temperature was a little bit more stable throughout the year
*31:03.380- 31:06.120* :  and their reproductive capabilities are rescued.
*31:06.580- 31:08.380* :  And about six months down the line,
*31:08.380- 31:11.180* :  they are mating and laying eggs.
*31:11.560- 31:13.360* :  One of the interesting things about Queen Conte
*31:13.360- 31:15.560* :  is that they have separate male and female sexes
*31:15.560- 31:16.220* :  just like humans.
*31:16.260- 31:20.500* :  But if their densities fall below a minimum threshold,
*31:20.540- 31:22.700* :  they have trouble finding each other.
*31:23.000- 31:25.380* :  And so what we're doing is moving these animals
*31:25.860- 31:28.400* :  from these areas where they're not reproductive
*31:29.060- 31:31.240* :  to some of these aggregations that are at
*31:31.240- 31:33.140* :  or below this minimum threshold
*31:33.140- 31:36.500* :  to boost reproductive output from that aggregation.
*31:37.140- 31:41.520* :  Now by doing this aren't you getting in the way of natural selection
*31:41.520- 31:44.820* :  and why is it important to preserve them?
*31:45.380- 31:48.460* :  If we were moving or releasing hatchery animals
*31:48.540- 31:51.700* :  that would be derived from very few parents,
*31:51.760- 31:53.760* :  then yes, we would be having genetic issues.
*31:54.140- 31:55.380* :  But in this particular case,
*31:55.700- 31:57.400* :  the genetics should not be an issue
*31:57.400- 32:01.180* :  because we're moving wild animals to other wild animals,
*32:01.180- 32:03.180* :  if you will, just boosting their density.
*32:03.920- 32:05.700* :  As far as why that's important,
*32:05.700- 32:09.600* :  the Queen Conk is a protected species in Florida.
*32:09.600- 32:12.740* :  There used to be commercial and recreational fisheries for them,
*32:12.740- 32:14.760* :  but they were closed due to overexplitation.
*32:15.500- 32:19.080* :  But culturally, the animal is still rather important to the Keys.
*32:19.080- 32:21.740* :  The Keys are affectionately known as the Conk Republic.
*32:22.320- 32:23.900* :  If you were born in the Keys,
*32:23.900- 32:25.620* :  you're known as a saltwater conk.
*32:26.060- 32:28.080* :  If you live in the Keys long enough,
*32:28.080- 32:30.580* :  they term you as a fresh water conk,
*32:30.760- 32:32.580* :  just to make a difference between those
*32:32.580- 32:34.780* :  who are actually native residents.
*32:35.260- 32:38.260* :  So the animal is rather iconic to the Keys
*32:38.260- 32:39.640* :  and also throughout the Caribbean
*32:39.640- 32:42.100* :  where population still support fisheries.
*32:42.100- 32:44.680* :  So it's an important socio-economic species
*32:44.680- 32:45.920* :  throughout its range.
*32:46.160- 32:48.140* :  Research scientists, Gabriel Delgado.
*32:50.380- 32:51.500* :  And that's all from us for now.
