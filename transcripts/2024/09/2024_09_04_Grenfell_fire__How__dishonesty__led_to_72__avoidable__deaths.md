*00:45.760- 00:51.300* :  opposite of what Big Wireless does. They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally,
*00:51.300- 00:56.380* :  when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our
*00:56.380- 01:01.520* :  prices due to not hating you. That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a
*01:01.520- 01:07.820* :  month to just $15 a month. Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch. $45 upfront for three months

*01:21.400- 01:26.480* :  I'm Nick Miles, and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday, the 4th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:27.100- 01:32.780* :  A long awaited report into one of Britain's worst ever residential fires has blamed decades of
*01:32.780- 01:39.320* :  failure and dishonesty. There have been widespread Russian missile and drone strikes on Ukraine.
*01:39.760- 01:44.620* :  I was walking up by the explosions. Each month, each day, Russia's
*01:44.620- 01:49.980* :  shelling Ukraine sending ballistic missiles. It's part of nightmare we're living in.
*01:50.400- 01:56.540* :  The Pope is in Indonesia calling for interfaith unity, and a mayor in the Philippines is accused
*01:56.540- 02:03.620* :  of spying for China. Also in this podcast, we take a trip to Eastern Europe.
*02:04.060- 02:11.600* :  The Banyan country has been made famous through millions of articles in the world for its
*02:11.600- 02:18.080* :  wilderness and its untouched beauty. But with a huge drive for tourism growth, how long will it
*02:18.080- 02:26.640* :  stay that way? We start this podcast with the results of a long awaited report into one of Britain's
*02:26.640- 02:34.360* :  worst ever residential fires that killed 72 people back in 2017. The team, conducting the inquiry,
*02:34.360- 02:40.100* :  was firm in blaming dishonest companies and in different authorities for the disaster.
*02:40.100- 02:45.320* :  The chair of it, Martin Morbick, listed those behind the failings, including successive
*02:45.920- 02:49.980* :  governments, building companies, the local council and the London fire brigade.
*02:50.660- 02:55.500* :  The simple truth is that the deaths that occurred were all avoidable,
*02:56.380- 03:00.320* :  and those who lived in the tower were badly failed over a number of years,
*03:01.160- 03:07.340* :  and in a number of different ways, by those who were responsible for ensuring the safety of
*03:07.340- 03:13.060* :  the building and its occupants. Not all of them bear the same degree of responsibility for the
*03:13.060- 03:20.300* :  eventual disaster, but as our reports show, all contributed to it in one way or another,
*03:21.420- 03:27.360* :  in most cases, through incompetence, but in some cases, through dishonesty and greed.
*03:28.220- 03:33.600* :  Shortly afterwards, Natasha Elcock from Grenfeld United, which represents the families of those
*03:33.600- 03:39.100* :  who died in the fire, gave her reaction to the report. This country has been failed by
*03:39.100- 03:45.000* :  governments of all political persuasions. Our expectation is your government will break old habits
*03:45.660- 03:50.460* :  and implement all the recommendations made by Sir Martin Morbick's report, because the time
*03:50.460- 03:55.000* :  to address this is already three decades too late. For the report to be worth anything,
*03:55.000- 04:00.480* :  it must bring systematic change. To prevent another tragedy like Grenfeld, your government
*04:00.480- 04:05.680* :  needs to create something that doesn't exist. You must become a government with the power and
*04:05.680- 04:11.480* :  ability to separate itself from the construction industry and corporate lobbying. Our London correspondent
*04:11.480- 04:16.300* :  Rob Watson told me more about the findings and how he reported on the fire at the time.
*04:16.880- 04:21.620* :  I should say that did I was there that morning of the fire reporting on it for the BBC World
*04:21.620- 04:27.640* :  Service, and in 40 odd years of reporting in the UK on and off for the BBC, it was one of the
*04:27.640- 04:33.120* :  grimest things I've ever reported on and the shock in the community was extraordinary just to put
*04:33.120- 04:39.800* :  this in some kind of context. Now to answer your question, the inquiry has made 58 recommendations,
*04:39.940- 04:45.340* :  but I'll just pick out, I guess, to the first two and the most striking one is that there should
*04:45.340- 04:50.700* :  be, from now on, a single construction regulator to make sure that there are standards throughout
*04:50.700- 04:55.720* :  the country and that there should be just one government minister to oversee the whole thing,
*04:55.720- 05:01.060* :  and that the guidance to the construction industry about fire safety should be revised because
*05:01.060- 05:05.780* :  it's inadequate. I think those are the two main ones that stand out. And Rob, what happens now
*05:05.780- 05:13.140* :  in terms of legal action? So in terms of legal action, it will be up to the central prosecution
*05:13.240- 05:18.160* :  service in this country to decide now that the inquiry is out of the way. Now that they've
*05:18.160- 05:24.340* :  heard a lot of evidence, is there enough? Can they build a case, criminal cases against some
*05:24.340- 05:29.840* :  of the individuals and companies named? And I don't think that's going to happen tomorrow next
*05:30.300- 05:36.240* :  week or in the coming months, but we probably would hear something in the next year or so.
*05:36.760- 05:40.900* :  And Rob, in terms of this is being seen to a certain extent, or the Grenfell was anyway,
*05:41.180- 05:46.780* :  in terms of the haves and haves and nots. Grenfell, a lot of low-income families in that tower block,
*05:46.780- 05:53.520* :  the perception was that people turned a blind eye to what was going on in Grenfell
*05:53.900- 05:57.360* :  because of the types of people there. Is that valid in any way?
*05:58.240- 06:04.360* :  That is what the inquiry found. And actually, that's what politicians have been saying in the last
*06:04.360- 06:09.520* :  hour or so since the report came out that that really was an element that an awful lot of the
*06:09.520- 06:15.060* :  people, the majority of people who lost their lives and who lived in Grenfell were people of color
*06:15.060- 06:20.080* :  and that they had been ignored perhaps partially because of that. Though, in other words,
*06:20.080- 06:25.600* :  there was a racial factor. I mean, the other aspect that's come out is that essentially,
*06:25.600- 06:31.420* :  this was sort of part of a wider malaise of deregulation and of governments and the construction
*06:31.460- 06:36.900* :  industry was going for the bottom line. In other words, their main eye was not on the safety of
*06:36.900- 06:42.380* :  people, but essentially on trying to save money. So it's a sobering moment for the state.
*06:43.260- 06:49.220* :  Rob Watson. To Ukraine now, where Russia's latest assault on the country has seen a major
*06:49.220- 06:54.940* :  attack on the western city of Lviv, at least seven people were killed there. It comes after
*06:54.940- 07:00.740* :  Tuesday's missile strike on the city of Poltava, which left more than 50 dead. It's led
*07:00.740- 07:06.000* :  Ukraine's president to call once again on the country's allies to provide more air defense systems.
*07:06.740- 07:12.880* :  The Ukrainian member of parliament, Alexander Merezhko, spoke to the BBC about the latest strikes.
*07:13.640- 07:20.420* :  So far, we know that Kiev was bombarded. I was walking up by the explosions. Lviv was bombarded,
*07:20.420- 07:26.840* :  you know, but it happens on daily basis. Well, each, each month, each day, Russia's
*07:27.160- 07:33.500* :  shell in Ukraine sending ballistic missiles. And we're kind of good used to this. It's part of
*07:33.500- 07:38.300* :  nightmare we're living in. The whole country, meanwhile, has been placed under air alert.
*07:38.880- 07:40.400* :  Nick Beak is in Poltava.
*07:41.380- 07:45.060* :  Worth reminding ourselves that Lviv is right in the west of the country. It's only about
*07:45.180- 07:50.280* :  40 miles or so from the Polish border. So right on the border of the European Union,
*07:50.280- 07:55.720* :  crucially, right on the edge of the NATO alliance, where that begins. But clearly, once again,
*07:55.720- 08:00.280* :  that has not deterred Russia. What we're hearing from Lviv is that at least seven people have
*08:00.280- 08:04.860* :  been killed, including three children. And we've been looking at some video that's emerged,
*08:04.860- 08:10.360* :  and it shows the moment of impact, a huge explosion, and then a very large amount of debris
*08:10.360- 08:15.540* :  raining down on what is clearly a residential area. So I think Lviv of all the places targeted
*08:15.540- 08:21.140* :  once again, the worst affected, although overnight, all of Ukraine was under an air radar alert.
*08:21.560- 08:27.600* :  Nick, you're in Poltava. The scene of a place where 50 people were killed yesterday in a strike
*08:27.600- 08:32.200* :  on a big building there. What's the latest where you are? Yeah, I'm just standing outside it now.
*08:32.200- 08:38.200* :  It's a military academy, and just around us, there are lots of soldiers as you'd expect, but also
*08:38.760- 08:44.220* :  tents have been set up, volunteers have arrived here with food, drink, coffee, and they've been
*08:44.220- 08:49.060* :  giving refreshments to the emergency services, the police, the fire service, who have been working
*08:49.060- 08:55.200* :  through the night. Now, this has not been a rescue operation. This has been a recover operation. We
*08:55.200- 09:00.620* :  heard last night that at least 18 people were unaccounted for trapped under the rubble, and just
*09:00.620- 09:05.960* :  looking at what they're doing now, this is really a case of moving all that has been damaged
*09:06.580- 09:13.920* :  from this place, because this was a huge double ballistic missile strike. We spoke to one cadet
*09:13.920- 09:19.200* :  who'd enrolled only two weeks ago who said that the two strikes came in in very quick succession,
*09:19.200- 09:24.520* :  and people simply didn't have any time to get to safety. President Zelenskiy says there needs
*09:24.520- 09:28.580* :  to be a big investigation into what happened here. And Nick, all this comes when there's a bit of
*09:28.620- 09:33.560* :  political upheaval going on in Ukraine at the moment. The foreign ministers just been removed from
*09:33.560- 09:40.920* :  office. Other people are expected to change in a reshuffle. What's going on? Yes, we have seen over
*09:40.920- 09:46.180* :  the past two and a half years, some reprashing of both the military and also the political
*09:46.180- 09:51.100* :  setup here. President Zelenskiy has said he's been keen to do that. We haven't got all the details
*09:51.100- 09:54.780* :  yet, but it does seem that this is quite a significant reshuffle that President Zelenski
*09:55.220- 10:01.100* :  is doing. Apparently his aim is that he wants to get Ukraine in a better position for the autumn
*10:01.100- 10:06.100* :  and all the challenges that will bring. I'm thinking about the continued Russian strikes on the
*10:06.100- 10:10.820* :  energy infrastructure. We don't quite know the details, but certainly we've seen a resignation
*10:10.820- 10:15.340* :  letter from foreign minister Kulabah who's been a really pivotal figure, someone who's
*10:15.340- 10:20.940* :  toured around European world capitals over the past two and a half years and trying to ask for more help.
*10:21.620- 10:28.120* :  Nick Beak. A mayor from the Philippines, who's been accused of being a Chinese spy and of
*10:28.120- 10:34.200* :  involvement in human trafficking, has been arrested in Indonesia. Allen Squill, who was a political
*10:34.200- 10:38.640* :  novice when she was elected two years ago as mayor of a small town north of Manila,
*10:39.120- 10:43.940* :  is wanted in the Philippines on a number of charges related to offshore gambling hubs operating
*10:43.940- 10:49.520* :  in her municipality. Questions have been raised in the Philippines Senate about her true identity
*10:49.520- 10:54.380* :  with some suggesting she may have been working for the Chinese government. Here's our south-east
*10:54.380- 11:00.580* :  Asia correspondent Jonathan Het. The saga of 37-year-old Alice Guo has gripped the Philippines for
*11:00.580- 11:06.400* :  much of this year. After a police raid on a huge offshore gambling compound in the town where she
*11:06.400- 11:12.840* :  was mayor revealed evidence of human trafficking and online scam operations. She managed to leave the
*11:12.840- 11:18.140* :  country in July but has now been arrested near the Indonesian capital Jakarta and is awaiting
*11:18.140- 11:24.880* :  deportation. Alice Guo was accused of being a part owner of the gambling operation. A Senate inquiry
*11:24.880- 11:30.460* :  then raised questions about her true nationality after her birth certificate was found to have been
*11:30.460- 11:36.540* :  registered only when she was 17. No one seems to have known anything about her before she ran for
*11:36.540- 11:42.840* :  mayor in the small town of Bamban two years ago. One senator has suggested that she may be a Chinese
*11:43.420- 11:49.020* :  spy. Alice Guo says she was brought up by her Chinese father on a pig farm that she did not
*11:49.020- 11:54.980* :  know her mother and that she was schooled at home. The offshore gambling business grew rapidly after
*11:54.980- 12:00.460* :  it was legalized under the previous Duterte administration, attracting large numbers of Chinese
*12:00.460- 12:06.180* :  investors. However, the business has been tarnished by links to online scam centres and human
*12:06.540- 12:12.700* :  trafficking and was banned by President Marcos in June. The questions raised about Alice Guo's
*12:12.700- 12:18.040* :  origins have coincided with deteriorating relations between the Philippines and China
*12:18.500- 12:22.240* :  over disputed islands in the South China Sea. Jonathan Hade.
*12:23.160- 12:29.200* :  Biela Rousse has released 30 more prisoners who had taken part in anti-govern protests. An
*12:29.200- 12:34.720* :  official statement described this as a humanitarian gesture saying that the 23 men and seven women
*12:34.720- 12:40.360* :  were mostly parents of young children. Human rights activists say there are about 1,400 people
*12:40.360- 12:46.100* :  in prison in Biela Rousse for voicing dissent against Alexander Lukashenko who has run the country
*12:46.100- 12:53.440* :  since 1994. Here's our Europe regional editor Paul Moss. It's four years since Belarus was rocked
*12:53.440- 12:59.460* :  by demonstrations against its presidential election, which saw Alexander Lukashenko return to power
*12:59.460- 13:05.100* :  for a sixth time. Governments around the world criticized the result as fraudulent and protesters
*13:05.100- 13:10.860* :  took to the streets. More than a thousand were arrested. Now 30 of those people have apparently
*13:10.860- 13:16.900* :  been released. But human rights groups say it's a total of more than 1,400 remain in Belarusian
*13:16.900- 13:22.240* :  prisons, simply for criticizing the government. They've also warned that prisoners are sometimes
*13:22.240- 13:29.600* :  re-arrested soon after being freed. Paul Moss. From Barcelona to Athens, tourism has become a
*13:29.600- 13:35.960* :  controversial issue across many southern European destinations, particularly this summer. However,
*13:36.300- 13:42.540* :  in Albania, holidaymakers are welcomed. According to the UN, it is number one in Europe for tourism
*13:42.540- 13:48.520* :  growth and fourth in the world. Our reporter Daniel Rosni has been to Albania to find out more.
*13:51.360- 13:56.420* :  As you can hear, the crystal clear water is crashing into a beach in Vlor, the country's third
*13:56.420- 14:01.800* :  largest city. Around 3 million people live here in Albania, but the government wants 14 million
*14:01.800- 14:08.980* :  tourists to visit by the end of 2024, like this woman. Why did you come here? Why? Because it's
*14:09.140- 14:17.980* :  cheap for us and I am a mother alone with three child. So it's the best option to go to the
*14:18.700- 14:24.140* :  beach invagation and have fun. Last year, the travel and tourism industry made up around 25%
*14:24.220- 14:30.500* :  of Albania's GDP. That's according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. It's partly thanks to
*14:30.500- 14:35.440* :  airlines like Wizair investing in routes to the Albanian capital, Tarana, four years ago.
*14:35.940- 14:42.580* :  Tomorrow, Nicky Friver is from Wizair. We have seen 13 fold girls in Albania in 2023,
*14:42.580- 14:49.120* :  compared to when we started. Basically, it's 50% growth year-on-year in the past couple of years.
*14:49.720- 14:54.220* :  With the global brands like the Hotel Chains, Maria, Hilton and Intercontinental have also
*14:54.220- 14:59.480* :  expanded here. The Albanian government wants to attract more big investors and is offering
*14:59.480- 15:04.880* :  to lease state-owned land for just over one US dollar to developers if they create jobs.
*15:04.880- 15:10.700* :  The former US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is hoping to build a $1 billion
*15:10.700- 15:15.680* :  luxury resort in the city of law. So Kushner wants to build there.
*15:17.320- 15:25.060* :  So my name is Yone Verbsi and I work at Pibenea, a bird-life Albania. The Albanian country has been
*15:25.660- 15:32.740* :  made famous through millions of articles in the world for its wilderness and its untouched beauty
*15:32.740- 15:38.320* :  and that's why millions of people came here last year. He's concerned about the environmental
*15:38.320- 15:44.080* :  impact of the resort on protected areas like this one and the nearby Natalagoon home to thousands
*15:44.080- 15:49.740* :  of flamingos. Kushner's plans haven't been formally approved yet but he's posted them on his
*15:49.740- 15:54.580* :  Instagram account. We asked for an interview with Kushner's firm Affinity Partners but didn't get
*15:54.580- 15:59.540* :  a response. Others, though, welcomed the new development. According to the World Travel and Tourism
*15:59.540- 16:05.340* :  Council, one in five people in Albania now have jobs supported by tourism, the mayor of law,
*16:05.340- 16:11.080* :  Ermold Dreda, wants that to increase even more. We are putting all our energies,
*16:12.220- 16:17.080* :  how to develop more, how to create more space, but we don't see it as a problem.
*16:17.420- 16:20.680* :  Onella Lippory, editor-in-chief of the Business Magazine Monitor,
*16:20.680- 16:26.860* :  is also concerned that it's only a small number of international brands investing in Albania.
*16:27.220- 16:31.340* :  This money does not bring the long-term growth because you can build now,
*16:31.340- 16:34.300* :  you don't have international companies or people who work there.
*16:34.740- 16:39.600* :  We're back on the beach. Visitors are only too aware that Albania wants to become a top
*16:39.600- 16:45.160* :  tourist destination. We think that the tourism will take off really soon, big time. It will be
*16:45.160- 16:50.000* :  nice to go now before it's ruined. The Albanian government now has the difficult task of
*16:50.000- 16:55.560* :  encouraging the brands and developers to invest while keeping the landscape that attracts tourists
*16:55.560- 17:02.480* :  in the first place. Daniel Rosny. Still to come in this podcast.
*17:03.180- 17:08.780* :  On average, as people score higher in their belief in this, there is a kind of higher
*17:08.780- 17:14.380* :  probability in our studies that they reported being bankrupt. We take a deeper look at the wellness
*17:14.380- 17:17.300* :  trend that's become a multi-billion dollar business.

*18:27.120- 18:33.240* :  Let's go to Indonesia now, where Pope Francis is on the first stop of a four-nation tour of Asia,
*18:33.580- 18:40.080* :  the longest trip of his papacy so far. So why is this trip so interesting? Well, Indonesia has the
*18:40.080- 18:45.740* :  world's largest Muslim population, but is officially a secular state with significant religious
*18:45.740- 18:51.480* :  minorities, including around 8 million Roman Catholics. The 87-year-old Pontiff has been
*18:51.480- 18:55.700* :  addressing politicians and religious leaders at the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
*19:00.460- 19:06.320* :  To favor peaceful and constructive harmony that assures peace and unites forces to defeat
*19:06.320- 19:12.920* :  the imbalances and bags of misery that still persist in some areas, the church wants to increase
*19:12.920- 19:19.460* :  into religious dialogue. In this way, prejudices can be eliminated and a climate of mutual
*19:19.460- 19:26.200* :  respect and trust can grow. Our correspondent Hannah Somersier is covering the Pope's visit in Jakarta.
*19:26.640- 19:33.940* :  The Pope has held Indonesia as the model of unity, but he also stressed that there's still
*19:33.940- 19:42.260* :  extremism in Indonesia. So despite the government efforts to de-radicalize the extremists
*19:42.780- 19:49.280* :  in Indonesia, there are still a lot of terrorist organizations even inside the capital city of Jakarta.
*19:49.780- 19:58.340* :  So to strengthen this message, the Pope wants to hold a religious meeting tomorrow at the largest
*19:58.340- 20:06.360* :  mosque in the South Asia, called Istiklal Mosque. So he wants to strengthen the message by holding
*20:06.360- 20:13.700* :  this meeting with six other religion leaders. And Hannah, you talked about extremist groups that
*20:13.700- 20:19.140* :  is on the far end of the problems that Indonesia has, but what about on a day-to-day basis?
*20:19.520- 20:23.320* :  Is there much generally intolerance towards religious minorities still?
*20:23.900- 20:33.680* :  Yes, intolerance is not too high, but it's stagnant. There has been some ban for the people
*20:33.680- 20:40.940* :  who want to build church and etc. And also they are banning the extremist organizations,
*20:41.880- 20:50.480* :  urge the government to close or ban other religions that want to hold a mass or
*20:50.480- 20:59.260* :  but it's just in the outskirts of Indonesia. So there are still some incidents, but right now the
*20:59.260- 21:06.800* :  government is trying to address this issue. Some human rights groups said that the effort that
*21:06.800- 21:12.960* :  done by the government was not enough and we are still waiting for the next step from the government
*21:12.960- 21:18.620* :  to address this issue. And Hannah, I mentioned that there are only 8 million Roman Catholics in Indonesia.
*21:18.620- 21:25.480* :  What about the rest of the country? Is the Pope's visit getting a lot of credence, a lot of
*21:25.480- 21:31.720* :  interest from them as well? Yeah, just this morning, I covered the Pope visit to the President
*21:31.720- 21:38.040* :  of Seattle Palace in Jakarta and when the Pope was holding a meeting with the president outside
*21:38.040- 21:46.040* :  the presidential palace, people gathered and they hope to see the side of the Pope and they're
*21:46.040- 21:51.840* :  all coming from the different backgrounds like their Muslims, Buddhist, Christians. So
*21:52.240- 21:59.760* :  Indonesian people welcome the Pope with such a warm welcome, but some of them also said that
*21:59.760- 22:05.220* :  the Pope also needs to address intolerance that are still happening in Indonesia.
*22:05.820- 22:11.880* :  Hannah, someone say that. Now do you struggle with new technology but are scared to admit it?
*22:12.500- 22:17.380* :  If so, it seems you're in good company. Two-thirds of business leaders are afraid to admit
*22:17.380- 22:22.200* :  when they don't understand new technology. That's according to a recent survey. Over half
*22:22.200- 22:28.200* :  also admitted to spending money on digital services that they don't understand or have not helped
*22:28.200- 22:32.600* :  the business. Apparently, it's down to a fear of looking old and out of touch.
*22:33.360- 22:39.720* :  Law Redmond is managing partner at the marketing agency BBD Perfect Storm, which was behind the
*22:39.720- 22:45.480* :  research and she spoke to my colleague Sally Bundek. It is unfortunate that we are seeing that the
*22:45.480- 22:50.040* :  fear of tech is holding a lot of business leaders back and I think this has been dazzled by the
*22:50.040- 22:55.180* :  complexity of the amount of digital solutions and channels available to them. It's becoming quite
*22:55.620- 23:00.500* :  hard to understand where to invest and what we're finding is almost half of that like you said
*23:00.500- 23:06.320* :  are losing sleep over the fear of the pace of digital change right now. And it is extremely
*23:06.320- 23:12.220* :  fast pace. We've been talking about artificial intelligence so much this year and last year.
*23:12.680- 23:18.120* :  So what's the answer for those CEOs, bosses of companies who are in this position, what should they
*23:18.120- 23:24.640* :  do? I think to eradicate this fear because it can stifle innovation. It's really important to
*23:24.640- 23:30.960* :  raise a hand and seek advice, find those experts who can support them and help them navigate through
*23:30.960- 23:35.380* :  these digital spaces because at the minute we're finding that they are, they're fear admitting
*23:35.380- 23:40.720* :  that they don't understand and it is time to take a step back, face into some tough questions
*23:40.860- 23:45.700* :  and get that advice and help. It's getting the right advice and help though isn't it because you
*23:45.700- 23:51.400* :  get bamboozled by this sort of IT tech consultants who come in with all the language and the jargon
*23:51.400- 23:55.340* :  that you really don't understand and you end up paying them a lot of money for services that you
*23:55.340- 24:00.600* :  still don't understand and it may not benefit your business. Well I think that's fine, that's also
*24:01.300- 24:05.760* :  like we said over half of business leaders are admitting to having spent money in these places
*24:05.760- 24:10.420* :  and not understanding the technology but I think it's important that we come together and
*24:10.420- 24:17.240* :  not let technology happen to them but let's make technology work for them and let's how it's
*24:17.240- 24:22.380* :  find a way to make it work for their business and make it much more worthwhile in terms of where
*24:22.380- 24:27.660* :  they're investing and getting the best returns. That was Laura Redmond. Japan has managed to eradicate
*24:27.660- 24:34.060* :  a population of mongooses after a decade's long battle. They were released on a southern island
*24:34.060- 24:40.160* :  to kill venomous snakes but their numbers ended up endangering the Amami rabbit that's a special
*24:40.160- 24:48.020* :  national treasure. Mickey Brister reports. 30 mongooses were released on Amami Oshima in the late 1970s
*24:48.460- 24:53.460* :  to kill a poisonous viper known as the Habu but the snakes are mostly active at night
*24:54.000- 24:59.400* :  when the mongooses prefer to sleep so they started attacking where Amami rabbits instead.
*25:00.200- 25:06.000* :  The population of rabbits plunged and Japan realized it would have to get rid of the invasive mongooses.
*25:06.660- 25:12.740* :  The campaign began in the year 2000 using traps and stiffer dogs. The last mongoose was caught
*25:12.740- 25:20.000* :  six years ago with officials confident they've now all gone. Now from mongooses to the business of
*25:20.000- 25:26.620* :  manifesting. In the modern sense it means trying to make something happen by imagining it
*25:27.060- 25:31.960* :  and consciously thinking that it will happen, like a dream job or even a healthy body,
*25:32.400- 25:39.600* :  a sort of hyper-focus positive thinking. When the pop star Dua Lipa headlined the UK's Glaston
*25:39.600- 25:45.220* :  Breast Festival earlier this year, for example, she said she'd manifested the moment. Some
*25:45.220- 25:50.600* :  footballers say they envision themselves scoring goals before a game. It's all about seeing
*25:50.600- 25:56.200* :  yourself doing something and feeling how you'd feel doing it. Well some people, of course,
*25:56.520- 26:02.620* :  think that's a bunch of nonsense. Whatever the truth, manifesting is now part of a multi-billion
*26:02.620- 26:08.900* :  dollar wellness market, particularly online. Business Daily reporter Megan Lawton has been hearing
*26:08.900- 26:18.500* :  from those who are part of it. We're in the Toronto home of Alicia Tleon, who has gained 60,000
*26:18.500- 26:24.320* :  followers on TikTok in less than a year by posting videos about manifesting. In the past year,
*26:24.500- 26:30.080* :  I have significantly changed my entire life, okay? I got a new job. So there is a lot of money in
*26:30.080- 26:35.120* :  business, there's a lot of money in manifestation. It's in this flat that she makes Instagram and
*26:35.120- 26:41.020* :  TikTok content, which she gets paid for, thanks to brand deals and the TikTok creator fund,
*26:41.020- 26:47.580* :  which pays out based on views. So if you, different avenues, of course, is coaching, you can do,
*26:48.060- 26:52.200* :  if you're paying TikTok Reels, you can make money off of that or Instagram as well. There's a lot of
*26:52.200- 26:57.300* :  brand partnerships that you can do. Alicia's online success is part of a bigger trend which emerged
*26:57.300- 27:02.940* :  during the pandemic, with searches for the practice rising more than 600% in March 2020,
*27:02.940- 27:08.400* :  according to Google data. But the business of manifesting goes beyond social media.
*27:08.600- 27:14.160* :  You're Spiritual Queen and welcome to my YouTube channel here on my channel. Emma Mumford is the UK's
*27:14.160- 27:20.200* :  leading manifestation expert, a best-selling author and host of the Spiritual Queen's Badass podcast.
*27:20.300- 27:25.920* :  Emma makes her money through her book deals, the wellness retreat she runs, and individual coaching
*27:25.920- 27:31.700* :  sessions. Since Emma started, she's found manifesting's appeal has broadened. I think it tends to be
*27:31.700- 27:36.660* :  younger now as well when I first started. Seven, eight years ago, it was more people my own age,
*27:36.660- 27:42.300* :  kind of in their 30s, 40s, 50s, whereas now I can see and I can have people in my group,
*27:42.300- 27:47.140* :  so it even come for one to one session and they could be 18 or they could be 60 or 70.
*27:47.460- 27:52.800* :  Type manifesting into any search engine and you'll be inundated with podcasts, articles, books
*27:52.800- 27:58.080* :  and inspirational quotes. The results that have come up here are all telling me how to manifest
*27:58.080- 28:04.080* :  anything I want, so instantly you can see the appeal. But not everyone sees the industry so
*28:04.080- 28:10.940* :  positively. So on average, as people score higher in their kind of belief in this, there is a kind
*28:10.940- 28:16.200* :  of higher probability in our studies that they reported being bankrupt. Dr Lucas Dixon is from
*28:16.200- 28:21.720* :  Queensland University, Australia. He's researched the psychology behind the concept of achieving
*28:21.720- 28:27.960* :  financial success through aspirational thinking. Manifestors were more likely to believe in
*28:27.960- 28:33.560* :  get rich quick schemes and they were also more likely to be bankrupt. Emma Mumford again.
*28:33.760- 28:38.280* :  I've never known personally anyone to go bankrupt from manifesting. If anybody online,
*28:38.280- 28:43.840* :  regardless of a manifestation teacher or, you know, anything self-development, if someone is
*28:44.220- 28:48.280* :  telling you to do something and it doesn't feel right, like use your discernment with that,
*28:48.280- 28:55.000* :  trust your intuition with that. Back in June, Julie Perth, holding audience of over 100,000 people,
*28:55.000- 29:00.580* :  that she manifested her way to headline in Glastonbury's pyramid stage. For trend forecasters
*29:00.580- 29:06.640* :  like Lucy Green, celebrity endorsements such as duers give manifesting. Tremendous impact on
*29:06.640- 29:13.340* :  legitimising it as an idea and a methodology. It kind of sits within a broader trend among millennials
*29:13.340- 29:21.440* :  and Gen Z's for, and men and women, not just women, for living your best life and using manifesting
*29:21.440- 29:28.100* :  to self-actualise and achieve everything that you deserve and want. The Global Wellness Institute
*29:28.100- 29:35.540* :  estimates that the wellness economy could be worth $8.5 trillion by 2027 with manifesting playing
*29:35.540- 29:42.380* :  a key part in the growth. That was Meghan Lawton reporting. Almost four decades after the movie
*29:42.380- 29:49.360* :  Beetlejuice became a smash hit, making around $75 million worldwide, and that was back in 1988.
*29:50.140- 29:56.400* :  It is back. Director Tim Burton is once again at the helm, others from the 1988 cast have returned,
*29:56.460- 30:02.460* :  and they're joined by new stars like Jenna Ortega, perhaps best known for her role as Wednesday.
*30:03.220- 30:05.160* :  Charlotte Gallagher has met some of the cast.
*30:07.480- 30:13.040* :  The juice is loose. I already was excited because I know when I'm walking into it, just to know
*30:13.720- 30:19.660* :  if I could bring it, and then he starts walking on the sets and then you go, oh yeah, I remember
*30:19.660- 30:26.380* :  this. You just see him concentrating here. Sporting the trademark wild hair and black eyes.
*30:27.360- 30:31.800* :  Michael Keaton is also joined by Winona Ryder from the original cast. You're saying that someone
*30:31.800- 30:37.380* :  called Beetlejuice? Don't say his name. If you say his name three times, he will appear. How much
*30:37.380- 30:41.320* :  of you is a Beetlejuice? I know you're not a demon, but like do you put some of yourself in it?
*30:41.320- 30:44.600* :  How do you know I'm not a demon? Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.
*30:47.940- 30:52.140* :  Justin Theroux, who is perhaps best known as the former husband of Jennifer Aniston,
*30:52.640- 30:56.240* :  is one of the new cast members, playing the creepy fiance.
*30:56.580- 31:00.680* :  You're a figment of my imagination. Really? Is this a figment of your imagination?
*31:03.200- 31:05.480* :  He based the character on his own mother's boyfriends.
*31:06.060- 31:13.020* :  My mom was a single mom and periodically, not often, but she would bring back like a boyfriend
*31:13.020- 31:17.160* :  who, you know, had three kids and he would try to appreciate himself to the family.
*31:17.160- 31:22.180* :  And it was always be way too quick, you know, to be like, hey, what's going on? What are you up to?
*31:22.180- 31:27.580* :  Take a look at him. Give me a hug. Now I'm not so bad for him. Yeah, go on, man.
*31:29.340- 31:33.960* :  If he wants to marry this woman, he's got to win the hearts of the family.
*31:33.960- 31:38.500* :  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's that was just what would be the worst thing for him to do right now.
*31:38.500- 31:42.420* :  It'd be like, yeah, comfort her daughter, you know, yeah, and then for Pays.
*31:42.620- 31:50.900* :  Yeah, exactly. When stage star, Jenna Ortega, makes her Beetlejuice debut as
*31:50.900- 31:57.460* :  were known a rider's troubled daughter. And Catherine O'Hara returns as her step-grandmother.
*31:57.660- 32:01.560* :  This one, it is a lot more emotional than the last one and I think it's actually pretty
*32:01.560- 32:06.880* :  incredible to focus, you know, such an insane story on, you know, which is named after a character
*32:06.880- 32:13.260* :  who is sleazy and disgusting and gross or whatever and still make it a film about women and kind of
*32:13.260- 32:17.680* :  in love and family. Exactly. That's true. There'd been rumours about a Beetlejuice kind of remake,
*32:17.680- 32:23.660* :  like Beetlejuice in Hawaii. We surprised that at this point, 36 years after it finally got made.
*32:23.860- 32:27.520* :  Yeah, it was funny to actually get a call from the actual director, Tim Collins,
*32:27.820- 32:33.080* :  and he was just in a place where he felt like he'd lost his way. And he just wanted to get back
*32:33.080- 32:37.580* :  to who he was and what he really loved doing and things he cared about and things that make him laugh,
*32:37.580- 32:47.480* :  which are all over this movie. What?! Why?! No! No! No! I'm trying to capture the perfect
*32:47.480- 32:51.780* :  primal screen. I'm going to blow it up, mount it on the wall, and I invite all of you to do the same.
*32:52.040- 32:55.520* :  For you, Jenna, I feel like you often play these very strong young women who are not afraid of
*32:55.540- 32:59.140* :  standing out and being their own person. Is that important to you when you think about
*32:59.280- 33:02.840* :  you've got so many young fans and then you play these roles that they will stand up for what they
*33:02.840- 33:07.040* :  believe in? Yeah, it's incredibly important. I mean, especially because, you know, maybe people
*33:07.040- 33:11.120* :  feel a little bit weirder, I feel like they stick out a little bit more in a crowd or, you know,
*33:11.120- 33:14.680* :  it's hard for them to relate to people. I think it's important to see people in these fields,
*33:14.680- 33:20.000* :  in these worlds, in these environments, and just kind of own it. Michael Keaton and Tim Burton
*33:20.000- 33:25.660* :  have made many films together, including two Batman's, but Keaton did have a few reservations
*33:25.660- 33:30.540* :  about that costume. The bat suit, you know, which a lot of people laughed at at the beginning,
*33:30.540- 33:34.500* :  at the point of years and the thing, and, you know, when you're getting into it, you think,
*33:34.540- 33:40.440* :  oh boy, this could go... this could go poorly. But work that suit, dude. Turn like that,
*33:41.060- 33:44.700* :  look like that, make that thing look powerful. I'm Batman.
*33:47.120- 33:51.540* :  That report by Charlotte Gallagher meeting the cast of Beetlejuice, the sequel.
*33:53.920- 33:57.800* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*34:31.080- 34:37.720* :  facing Boeing after failures of its Starliner spacecraft have left two astronauts stranded in space.
*34:38.460- 34:41.840* :  They were supposed to be on the International Space Station for eight days,
*34:41.840- 34:47.700* :  but will now be there for at least eight months. This is the latest in a long line of crises
*34:47.700- 34:54.620* :  facing the company. So is this one failure too far for Boeing? Find us wherever you get your podcasts.
