*01:20.100- 01:23.240* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:26.380- 01:29.900* :  I'm Paul Moss and in the early hours of Wednesday 25th of September,
*01:29.900- 01:35.460* :  these are our main stories. Lebanon's Health Minister says two days of Israeli air strikes have
*01:35.460- 01:40.900* :  created carnage across the country. The United Nations meets in New York with the Middle East
*01:40.900- 01:46.840* :  top of the agenda and CrowdStrike, the company responsible for the world's worst computer glitch,
*01:47.300- 01:48.140* :  is held to account.
*01:51.320- 01:52.440* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:00.440- 02:03.480* :  the news sound being used to start races in Ukraine.
*02:08.680- 02:12.840* :  When air strikes hit southern Lebanon on Monday, many people fled northwards.
*02:12.840- 02:18.900* :  Some of them heading to the capital Beirut, but Tuesday saw Beirut also hit by deadly air strikes.
*02:18.940- 02:24.260* :  Six people were killed and among them, according to the Israelis, was a senior Hezbollah commander,
*02:24.520- 02:29.240* :  Ibrahim Muhammad Kubasi. He was in charge of the group's missile and rocket force,
*02:29.240- 02:36.000* :  but whether or not he was successfully targeted, the Lebanese MP Ibrahim Nemne said civilians were
*02:36.000- 02:40.360* :  directly in the firing line. We cannot accept the kinds of attacks that
*02:40.360- 02:46.720* :  are taking place on our nation. We have 10,000 of Lebanese people being displaced right now.
*02:46.760- 02:51.460* :  They have nowhere to go. And for the Israelis, they seem like they are just collaterant
*02:51.460- 02:55.920* :  damage. If they see a target, they just go out and they attack. It's unimaginable.
*02:55.920- 03:01.160* :  It's an amount of damage and the repercussions that is having our people and our economy
*03:01.160- 03:02.680* :  and as a whole as a nation.
*03:03.480- 03:09.220* :  Israel says it warn civilians to leave areas it plans to attack, sending messages to people's
*03:09.220- 03:14.920* :  mobile phones. Of course, for obvious reasons, some Lebanese are now rather wary of using any kind
*03:14.920- 03:20.220* :  of electronic communications equipment. And as these people explain, the messages cause considerable
*03:20.220- 03:26.820* :  confusion anyway. We all receive messages at home, but from different numbers and names.
*03:27.080- 03:31.300* :  The message said that we had to flee our neighborhood because it was close to the size that would
*03:31.300- 03:36.960* :  be hit and close to weapon depots as well. After was the whole of southern Lebanon began to be
*03:36.960- 03:40.620* :  hit, more than 100 towns were rocked by blasts. It was a massacre.
*03:42.620- 03:47.180* :  They sent us a message threatening us to leave our land or villages in our homes,
*03:47.880- 03:53.500* :  but we will not leave the land, the houses, the family or the villages, even if we suffer a lot of
*03:57.260- 04:01.320* :  losses. The gas stations have been traffic jammed as the service pressures on them increased.
*04:01.320- 04:05.920* :  People are afraid that this war will last and their displacement will last longer.
*04:06.640- 04:12.120* :  They do not know where they will go then. We are tired and afraid because Israel does not
*04:12.120- 04:17.160* :  differentiate between us and anyone else. It does not differentiate between civilians and
*04:17.160- 04:23.300* :  non civilians. Israel, of course, continues to deny this. As with its assault on Gaza claiming,
*04:23.300- 04:28.740* :  it tries to avoid civilian deaths. And in any case, according to Moshe Terpaz and Israeli
*04:28.740- 04:34.460* :  member of parliament, his country has a right to respond to the aerial attacks emanating from Lebanon.
*04:35.020- 04:40.640* :  There's a hundred percent consensus in Israel that Israel has to fight back
*04:40.640- 04:47.840* :  Kisbala, which has been shooting at Israel missiles from the summit of October. When we are
*04:47.840- 04:55.860* :  shot on an everyday basis, there's no question about the need to react and to overcome the missiles
*04:55.860- 05:00.580* :  that are shot at Israel. But it seems there were more air strikes on Lebanon later on Tuesday.
*05:01.080- 05:04.500* :  Our correspondent in Beirut Annan Foster told me what she witnessed.
*05:30.460- 05:37.920* :  Now in hearing them, in the Lebanese capital feels so unusual at the moment. It really shows you
*05:37.920- 05:42.660* :  the level of escalation that we're at now. In that situation, it might sound odd to speak of
*05:43.040- 05:47.780* :  restraint, but we know that Hezbollah has these much longer-range missiles that they haven't been
*05:47.780- 05:53.100* :  firing. Presumably, that's the fear at the moment that they will let these off and attack Israel with them.
*05:53.440- 05:57.200* :  Well, these are questions that are being asked constantly. You just, you know, people at home,
*05:57.200- 06:02.980* :  people in the street. And yes, exactly wondering why. Now, Israel will say that they have worked
*06:02.980- 06:08.920* :  very hard in the last few days to degrade Hezbollah's capability. They say that all of these air strikes
*06:08.920- 06:14.040* :  that they're carrying out in the Becar Valley, in the south of Lebanon, they say they've been
*06:14.040- 06:20.600* :  destroying these weapon stores. And Hezbollah is quite clearly a more difficult position that
*06:20.600- 06:26.000* :  it perhaps expected to be if it does use some of those long-range weapons. But again, we're just
*06:26.000- 06:31.040* :  in a situation, though, that so many conversations have so many theories, but yet you still feel that
*06:31.040- 06:35.140* :  we will wake up tomorrow morning, and nobody quite knows what the next step is going to be.
*06:35.380- 06:41.200* :  Hezbollah draws most of its support from Lebanon's sheer population. And I'm wondering what other
*06:41.200- 06:46.020* :  communities think of what they're doing? Are they showing solidarity with Hezbollah for attacking
*06:46.020- 06:51.320* :  Israel or are they angry at the movement because it's bringing down all this destruction on Lebanon?
*06:51.880- 06:56.880* :  That is an interesting question. Actually, it gets to the heart of one of the key issues in
*06:56.880- 07:02.500* :  Lebanese society, which of course is these sectarian splits, which you see often now in the
*07:02.500- 07:07.480* :  politics of Lebanon, which was created after the Civil War, where you have these different
*07:07.480- 07:11.120* :  political parties, you have different positions in the government that are held by
*07:11.120- 07:17.200* :  shears, by Sunnis, by Maronite Christians, and normally those different groups
*07:17.200- 07:22.940* :  they struggle to agree. But one thing that does unite people is their hatred. It's a strong
*07:22.940- 07:30.080* :  word, but they're hatred of Israel. And so that is why I think you will see more popular support
*07:30.080- 07:35.700* :  for Hezbollah in this moment than you would do for anything else, because the history between
*07:35.700- 07:43.180* :  Lebanon and Israel, it runs deep, it is bitter, and it is difficult. And people will support
*07:43.180- 07:48.880* :  anything that they see, defends them against Israel. Anna Foster in Beirut.
*07:49.460- 07:54.660* :  It's an odd coincidence of timing that just as a full-scale regional war seems to be getting
*07:54.660- 07:59.520* :  ever more likely in the Middle East, a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly was being
*07:59.520- 08:05.060* :  held in New York, one obviously scheduled long in advance, but made perhaps more necessary
*08:05.060- 08:10.400* :  than ever. The situation in Lebanon featured high in the speeches. The UN Secretary-General
*08:10.400- 08:16.060* :  Antonio Quaterrace warned that Lebanon was on the brink. Joe Biden was addressing the assembly
*08:16.060- 08:21.660* :  for the last time as U.S. President and said that further escalation was in no one's interest,
*08:21.660- 08:24.520* :  though he made clear who he thought was to blame.
*08:25.100- 08:33.620* :  Hezbollah, unprovoked during the October 7 attack, launching rockets in Israel. Almost a year later,
*08:33.620- 08:37.960* :  too many on each side of the Israeli Lebanon border remained displaced.
*08:39.080- 08:43.600* :  Full-scale war is not in anyone's interest. Even a situation is escalated.
*08:44.780- 08:46.560* :  A diplomatic solution is still possible.
*08:47.200- 08:50.940* :  Joe Biden has, of course, talked about de-escalating the conflict in Gaza.
*08:51.580- 08:56.500* :  And his administration came up with several peace plans, only to see them rejected by Israel.
*08:56.500- 09:01.840* :  Critics said he didn't push Israel hard enough, continuing to supply it with military aid,
*09:01.840- 09:06.680* :  even as he urged restraint. So I asked our correspondent to the UN net at our peak.
*09:07.140- 09:11.320* :  Mr. Biden had said anything on Tuesday about Lebanon that gave people hope.
*09:11.940- 09:17.040* :  Delek, it's here we're listening to Joe Biden's speech for any signs of that,
*09:17.040- 09:22.880* :  or perhaps just new ideas to prevent an all-out war engulfing the Middle East. But
*09:23.600- 09:29.780* :  Joe Biden really didn't kind of offer anything different in his speech to the general assembly.
*09:30.380- 09:37.700* :  Very much still expressing commitment to Israel as the U.S.'s ally, and instead kind of having
*09:37.700- 09:43.960* :  this tone of optimism, this sense that a diplomatic solution is still possible, he says.
*09:44.380- 09:49.020* :  But I would just have to note that there has been a very different tone from others who have spoken.
*09:49.020- 09:53.720* :  You mentioned there the UN Secretary General warning that the world can't afford
*09:53.720- 09:59.420* :  for Lebanon's become another Gaza. But we also heard from Turkey's President, for example,
*09:59.420- 10:05.360* :  President Erdogan, saying that the values of the UN system and the Western world were dying in
*10:05.360- 10:10.940* :  Gaza and calling for an alliance of humanity to stop Israel and claiming that the UN is just
*10:10.940- 10:16.080* :  dysfunctional and needs to be reformed. Also, the Kingdom of Jordan, King Abdullah, also saying
*10:16.080- 10:22.520* :  it's no surprise that those in and outside of the UN feels like its ideals are crumbling.
*10:23.240- 10:27.900* :  Despite that tone of optimism from President Biden, very much real frustration being expressed
*10:27.900- 10:31.580* :  by other members here. I was going to ask you if the UN can really
*10:31.580- 10:36.560* :  achieve much with Lebanon. It sounds like either people there don't think the UN is up to this
*10:36.560- 10:41.100* :  task. Well, I think there's a realization that the UN is only as strong as its members,
*10:41.100- 10:48.020* :  and what we have seen over nearly a year is just how paralyzed the UN Security Council
*10:48.560- 10:54.220* :  can be on Gaza and in the Middle East, because again, the United States holds a veto wielding
*10:54.220- 10:58.800* :  power, regardless of the resolutions that have gone through the Security Council, in fact,
*10:58.800- 11:03.640* :  with the support of the U.S., we haven't seen that being implemented on the ground by Israel or
*11:03.640- 11:10.280* :  Hamas. So, when there is this kind of failure to have respect for UN Security Council resolutions
*11:10.280- 11:15.660* :  for decisions coming out of the International Court of Justice, there has been comments by UN
*11:15.660- 11:22.420* :  officials here that there has to be a reforming of the actual UN system, so it's not tied to just
*11:22.420- 11:26.300* :  the permanent five members of the Security Council. Nettafiq in New York.
*11:27.480- 11:32.980* :  How was July 19th view? You may remember that as the day that your train or bus wasn't running,
*11:33.340- 11:38.080* :  whether you couldn't take any money out of the bank. It was the day a company most of us had never
*11:38.080- 11:43.440* :  heard of made a mistake with a software update. This then disabled vast numbers of computers
*11:43.440- 11:48.820* :  around the world which used the Windows operating system. Crowdstrike was a company concerned,
*11:49.480- 11:54.340* :  and Tuesday, so one of its senior executives, Adam Myers, hold before a U.S. congressional
*11:54.340- 11:59.900* :  committee, he began with an apology. We let our customers down. Crowdstrike was in the process
*11:59.900- 12:04.900* :  of updating our customers on a new threat, or at least a content configuration update for the
*12:04.900- 12:09.160* :  Windows sensor that did not work as expected. This resulted in Microsoft's system crashes
*12:10.020- 12:15.420* :  for a number of our users. On behalf of everyone at Crowdstrike, I want to apologize. We're deeply
*12:15.420- 12:18.900* :  sorry, and we are determined to prevent this from ever happening again.
*12:19.640- 12:24.200* :  Sorry was of course not the only thing the committee wanted to hear, but also some kind of
*12:24.200- 12:29.220* :  explanation. I asked our tech correspondent, Lily Jamali, who's in Washington, what we learned.
*12:29.800- 12:34.260* :  There was plenty of tech speak there. In fact, the company had initially been asked to send
*12:34.260- 12:40.900* :  its CEO. It did not. It actually sent a different executive who is very high level in the
*12:40.900- 12:47.560* :  technologist realm, and ended up debriefing with members of Congress, has been doing so for
*12:47.560- 12:53.020* :  a couple of weeks now, so they sent him instead. Adam Myers is his name. A couple of lawmakers
*12:53.020- 12:58.060* :  had questions about artificial intelligence that came up a few times, whether that played a
*12:58.060- 13:03.420* :  role here. Today, we learned that it did not, that this was a standard update, the likes of which
*13:03.420- 13:08.900* :  get sent out 10 to 12 times a day, so not AI. But there were a lot of things that we already
*13:08.900- 13:15.320* :  knew that were sort of discussed again, including the fact that the issue that caused that July 19th
*13:15.520- 13:21.200* :  outage is now incapable of recurring. That particular one doesn't mean something else might not
*13:21.200- 13:26.240* :  bring systems down. And we also heard again about the fact that this was not a cyber attack,
*13:26.240- 13:31.500* :  which was very early on something people were wondering about on that day. This was an internal
*13:31.500- 13:37.200* :  error, which again, they say with confidence will not recur. I think what astonished so many of
*13:37.200- 13:41.080* :  us that day was to find out that as I said, a small company you've never heard of had the power
*13:41.080- 13:45.960* :  to bring down all these computer systems. And I guess what we want to know is, are there other
*13:45.960- 13:50.840* :  companies like that out there? I mean, it may well be that this one's got its fairs in order,
*13:50.840- 13:55.620* :  but others don't. Yeah, I mean, you're talking about the known unknown there. And I think that's
*13:56.060- 14:01.340* :  absolutely a concern. One of the issues that I found very interesting that was raised today,
*14:01.660- 14:07.040* :  this was from Congressman Eric Swalwell, who was a Democrat from California, was the issue
*14:07.040- 14:13.140* :  of market share. So 25% of Fortune 500 companies were affected by this outage.
*14:13.660- 14:19.600* :  And Swalwell talked about how with market share like that, this company has to ensure that they
*14:19.600- 14:24.640* :  secure against this type of risk. I mean, you're never going to get it 100% right. You're never
*14:24.640- 14:31.500* :  going to completely eliminate risks, but you need to come a lot closer than what we saw on that
*14:31.500- 14:37.940* :  particular day. And what we heard from Swalwell was a plea for cooperation. He said that companies
*14:37.940- 14:43.900* :  in this very sensitive cybersecurity space, which can bring entire companies down, bring entire
*14:43.900- 14:49.740* :  sectors down, these cybersecurity companies really need to work together. Even though they are
*14:49.740- 14:55.200* :  competitors, you know, Microsoft and CrowdStrike are competing. But in this case, they've actually
*14:55.200- 15:00.060* :  showed a lot of cooperation to try to strengthen the system so that something like this doesn't happen
*15:00.060- 15:06.640* :  again. Lily Jamali. The Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the most dangerous places
*15:06.640- 15:12.540* :  on earth. Dozens of armed groups rampaging through the region conflict has been going on for decades.
*15:12.540- 15:18.240* :  But despite all this, there is some rare good news from there. Conservationists say they've seen
*15:18.240- 15:23.500* :  an increase in the mountain gorilla population in the Varunga National Park. The newsrooms
*15:23.500- 15:29.240* :  Richard Hamilton has actually been to Varunga and first told me what it was like. It's staggeringly
*15:29.240- 15:34.940* :  beautiful. I went there in the early 1990s before the Ruand and Genocide and before all this
*15:34.960- 15:40.820* :  armed conflict kicked off. It's set amongst the foothills of the Ruanzori Mountains, which are
*15:40.820- 15:46.020* :  also called the Mountains of the Moon. It's very lush. It's volcanic. There's something like
*15:46.020- 15:52.080* :  3,000 different species of plants. And of course, the famous mountain gorillas. And within about an
*15:52.080- 15:58.460* :  hour, the park range has pointed out a silver back and a female gorilla. And there was a rustle
*15:58.460- 16:03.180* :  in the leaves and a sort of ball of fluff landed at our feet. And it was a baby gorilla playing
*16:03.180- 16:09.080* :  around our legs. So we got really close to them. And it was so moving to see these magnificent
*16:09.080- 16:14.520* :  creatures in the wild in their own natural habitat. It's something I'll never forget.
*16:15.180- 16:21.860* :  We're used to hearing about wild animals, including gorillas, being killed maybe by poachers.
*16:22.620- 16:26.760* :  Why is the gorilla population in this park apparently increased?
*16:27.500- 16:32.480* :  I think that's a bit of a conundrum. And we don't really know. And it may be a glitch,
*16:32.480- 16:37.860* :  because as you say, it's so dangerous there. And there's armed groups and there's been poaching.
*16:37.860- 16:45.760* :  But one of the things that the park rangers have trained up about 100 local people to act as community
*16:45.760- 16:52.080* :  trackers. And they have been going into the park every day and checking on the welfare of the gorillas.
*16:52.120- 16:57.980* :  I think that's made a difference. Just in this year alone, there have been 10 baby gorillas
*16:57.980- 17:06.800* :  born. And the population has now increased from a low point of about 350 in the 1980s to over a
*17:06.820- 17:12.640* :  thousand individual mountain gorillas. And a third of them are in the Virunga National Park.
*17:13.060- 17:19.820* :  At the same time, you do have not only poachers, but different armed factions fighting. You have
*17:19.820- 17:26.240* :  the threat of disease. They still face huge challenges, don't they? Keeping these gorillas alive.
*17:26.240- 17:32.560* :  That's right. And for the last 30 years, there's been armed conflict. There've been Hutu militia
*17:32.560- 17:40.340* :  that came from Rwanda. There's the M23 that's supposed to be backed by Rwanda. Over two million
*17:40.340- 17:46.720* :  people have been displaced in North Kivu. Many rangers have been killed. So it's so dangerous for
*17:46.720- 17:51.320* :  people to even do their jobs to look after the gorillas. And of course tourism, which used to
*17:51.320- 17:55.740* :  bring in a lot of money, that's out of the question at the moment because it's just there's too much
*17:55.740- 18:01.200* :  fighting over the resources. And there are traps that poachers set for other animals like
*18:01.200- 18:06.460* :  antelopes and pigs. And then baby gorillas who are inquisitive get caught in those snare traps as
*18:06.460- 18:12.520* :  well. So there's still a very precarious existence for these wonderful creatures. Richard Hamilton.
*18:12.520- 18:28.020* :  Still to come, the British sandwich maker who became a surprise hero in China.

*19:43.540- 19:47.460* :  The good news for American would be slimmers is that the weight loss drugs as
*19:47.460- 19:53.240* :  epic and we go v do seem to work. The bad news apparently is that Americans are paying more
*19:53.240- 19:58.760* :  than anyone else to shed those all important kilos. A month supply of the drug can cost over
*19:58.760- 20:03.840* :  a thousand dollars. Despite costing less than a hundred in countries like Germany or the UK.
*20:03.900- 20:09.980* :  That was the issue under examination at a US Senate hearing on Tuesday led by Bernie Sanders.
*20:09.980- 20:15.560* :  The committee grilled last Euginson CEO of the drug company Novo Nordisk which makes his
*20:15.560- 20:21.920* :  epic and we go v mr. Sanders lost no time in cutting to the chase. Bottom line is you are
*20:21.920- 20:27.740* :  charging the American people substantially more for the same exact drug than you are charging
*20:27.740- 20:33.360* :  people in other countries and my question is why. Last Euginson was ready with an answer.
*20:33.780- 20:38.000* :  The US he said had a complex health system which was to blame for the high prices.
*20:38.640- 20:42.680* :  He defended his company and its record of tackling obesity around the world.
*20:43.200- 20:48.960* :  For decades our public discourse about obesity and to some extent to diabetes was based on
*20:48.960- 20:55.120* :  misinformation and blame. These conditions were treated as a personal choice, a failure or willpower.
*20:55.960- 21:00.000* :  No one was talking about how these are chronic diseases and treatable diseases.
*21:01.060- 21:05.540* :  With the discovery of semi-glutite and the development of osemplik and we go we are collective
*21:06.360- 21:10.960* :  understanding of these diseases fundamentally changed. While watching the hearing was Dr.
*21:10.960- 21:15.840* :  Melissa Barber, a researcher at Yale University who studies pharmaceutical markets.
*21:16.460- 21:21.240* :  What did she make of Novo's argument? At the end of the day, Novo Nordisk sets the price,
*21:21.240- 21:26.280* :  right? It's been a useful excuse because we do have a very very complicated payment system
*21:26.700- 21:30.980* :  but it's been very much an excuse. Right now the US government, so the the federal health
*21:30.980- 21:35.360* :  programs we have are on track to spend more on wagovino's and picked than they spend on all
*21:35.360- 21:39.480* :  other prescription drugs but together it's about 170 billion. If you look at the private market
*21:39.480- 21:43.920* :  it's the same number, about 400 billion is projected to be spent if only half of the adults
*21:44.180- 21:48.260* :  who are eligible for these drugs take them. Novo Nordisk doesn't have the production capacity
*21:48.760- 21:53.220* :  to serve demand in the US or globally and this of course affects patients.
*21:53.740- 21:57.740* :  It also has a downstream effect on not just people that are using GLP ones but people that are
*21:57.740- 22:02.920* :  using insulin. GLP ones refer to a class of drugs of which osemplik and wagovina are our
*22:02.920- 22:08.480* :  part of. So Novo has pulled out of making human insulin times and insulin deadomere.
*22:09.060- 22:12.340* :  And why are they pulling out? Well when you have limited manufacturing capacity you're going to
*22:12.340- 22:17.280* :  prioritize the most profitable drugs. So GLP ones have a profit margin of about 30,000 percent.
*22:17.620- 22:22.580* :  Insulums have a very poultry profit margin of just 2000 percent. I think it's important to note
*22:22.580- 22:27.580* :  that these drugs are not available at any price in low and low income countries. Novo Nordisk
*22:27.580- 22:32.580* :  is not selling them. They're not available. So if you're saying oh you know you're starting
*22:32.580- 22:36.700* :  a lot in the US you can afford to be able to make these drugs accessible elsewhere. Not only
*22:36.700- 22:40.940* :  are they not selling them they're also cutting back on insulin. So about a few months ago
*22:41.660- 22:45.620* :  Novo Nordisk stops applying the South African public health system with insulin. Very abruptly
*22:45.620- 22:50.420* :  hugely catastrophic with health system. Really dangerous for patients to have to transition
*22:50.420- 22:55.520* :  really quickly not necessarily half supply. This is not about taking care of the global South.
*22:55.520- 22:58.100* :  This is very much just making as much profit as possible.
*22:58.500- 23:04.260* :  Dr Melissa Barber. After years of campaigning by LGBTQ activists in Thailand
*23:04.260- 23:09.580* :  it's finally happened. The country has become the first in Southeast Asia to legalize same
*23:09.580- 23:15.280* :  sex marriage. It's the third in Asia overall following the Paul and Taiwan. A new bill which
*23:15.280- 23:20.320* :  also includes adoption and inheritance rights was signed into law by the country's King.
*23:20.320- 23:26.420* :  Clizia Sala has this report. It was the last hurdle in a legislative process that took several
*23:26.420- 23:32.240* :  months. Thailand's parliament passed the same sex marriage bill in June and now King Mahavaj
*23:32.240- 23:37.420* :  Yalongkorn has given it royal approval. It marks the culmination of long years of campaigning,
*23:37.760- 23:42.040* :  often overshadowed by the country's recent history of political outstakes and mass street
*23:42.040- 23:47.440* :  protests. But Thailand is also known for its vibrant LGBT community and culture of tolerance
*23:48.040- 23:51.980* :  with strong public support for equal marriage. The new law will come into effect
*23:51.980- 23:56.080* :  early next year with the first same sex marriage is expected in January.
*23:56.880- 24:03.340* :  Clizia Sala. In the past 40 years the Amazon Rainforest has lost an area about the size of
*24:03.340- 24:09.760* :  Germany and France combined to deforestation. That's according to a new report by RISG,
*24:09.760- 24:15.120* :  the campaign group of science researchers. They found the rainforest was replaced by pasture
*24:15.120- 24:21.020* :  and soya bean fields for animals to graze in, or else it was dug up for gold mining. Meanwhile,
*24:21.020- 24:26.480* :  the region has also suffered particular devastation this year from wildfires, several of which
*24:26.480- 24:31.780* :  are currently ravaging the forests. Michael Sweet is professor of molecular ecology at the University
*24:31.780- 24:37.120* :  of Derby in the English Midlands. He warns that the rate of destruction is still increasing.
*24:45.060- 24:50.080* :  But it's the first time that it's been catalogued in such a reliable method.
*24:50.080- 24:56.220* :  So that's one-fifth of the entire Amazon which is now gone. But it gets even worse than that because
*24:56.560- 25:03.340* :  unfortunately more and more hectares are at threat. So it's thought to be about 38% of the forests as
*25:03.340- 25:09.580* :  well on top of that are actually in a degraded state. It's mostly deforestation associated with
*25:09.580- 25:16.600* :  agriculture for the most part. But then it's also entwined and linked with aspects of climate change,
*25:16.600- 25:22.540* :  which again are anthropogenically driven. So human derived climate change. And that's causing
*25:22.540- 25:29.240* :  the forests to dry out a lot more. So they're witnessing less rain. And so the Amazon on top of
*25:29.260- 25:34.740* :  losing the trees, the important tree aspect and obviously the biodiversity which goes with that,
*25:35.100- 25:39.480* :  the rivers are starting to dry out as well. And obviously the Amazon is famous for its river
*25:39.820- 25:44.320* :  as well as being the lungs of our planet. And we're now starting to see devastating effects
*25:44.320- 25:51.620* :  with this recently 120 of the endangered river dolphins being found dead as the rivers subsides.
*25:52.240- 25:59.260* :  Professor Michael Sweet. It was in 1904 that a pistol was first fired to start an Olympic race.
*25:59.940- 26:04.400* :  Since then that sound of a gunshots being used at track events around the world. But of course
*26:04.400- 26:10.500* :  gunshots have other associations for some people. There are countless stories of war veterans having
*26:10.500- 26:15.520* :  very serious reactions to the sound of a gun being fired. And some of those veterans might
*26:15.520- 26:21.440* :  well be involved in sporting competition. That's particularly likely in Ukraine where so many men
*26:21.440- 26:26.380* :  of fighting age have been sent to the front. For that reason, at the Kiev Marathon last weekend,
*26:26.900- 26:30.140* :  there was an alternative sound used to tell the runners when to start.
*26:41.980- 26:46.300* :  Well, that sound was created by Gus Kovan, the sound designer from Los Angeles.
*26:46.840- 26:50.080* :  He told James Kumarisami what motivated him to make it.
*26:50.680- 26:55.880* :  I do have a daughter who has special needs and she has sensitivities to loud sounds.
*26:55.880- 27:02.480* :  They do a lot of her friends. So when I was told about this sound, I immediately jumped at it
*27:02.480- 27:06.720* :  because it has so much meaning for me. So how did you approach this?
*27:06.900- 27:10.340* :  Well, we didn't start with a blank slate. There were a series of requirements.
*27:10.340- 27:15.420* :  So the sound needed to be clear. It needed to do a lot of the things that a pistol shot would do.
*27:16.000- 27:21.160* :  But without traumatizing people in this marathon, in particular, you have a lot of war veterans.
*27:21.980- 27:28.180* :  They had people in wheelchairs and people who were neurodiverse. And so it needed to be an
*27:28.180- 27:33.500* :  exciting sound, but it needed to also have the components that one would need to have at the
*27:33.500- 27:38.860* :  beginning of a race, right? Where you have a really loud burst that everybody can hear and
*27:38.860- 27:43.940* :  that it's crystal clear. And how did you did you test out different versions to work out with
*27:43.940- 27:48.040* :  people could hear it with that effect of actually getting them to start running?
*27:48.400- 27:56.200* :  So we ended up making probably close to 50 sounds. And then we narrowed those sounds down to
*27:56.200- 28:03.400* :  four or five sounds that were then tested at a university in Kiev on people who were war veterans,
*28:03.580- 28:09.840* :  some of whom were suffering from PTSD. And the sound that was eventually selected was the sound
*28:09.840- 28:14.720* :  that met all the criteria, but also caused the least amount of trauma.
*28:15.160- 28:20.700* :  And beyond countries like Ukraine, where, as you say, people are traumatized by war,
*28:20.700- 28:24.680* :  are there other places where you think this could replace the old gunshot?
*28:24.900- 28:30.160* :  I hope so. I mean, I'm a runner myself. And, you know, you're there on a starting line,
*28:30.160- 28:34.140* :  right? You've taken your gels, you've drunk your electrolytes, you're ready to go, and then there's
*28:34.140- 28:39.240* :  this sound that all of a sudden stresses you out as you're about to start. I feel like there's room,
*28:39.240- 28:44.720* :  there's a place for replacing the pistol sound everywhere. I mean, certainly here in the US,
*28:44.720- 28:49.760* :  we have a lot of gun violence. So I think it's not just war, it's everywhere.
*28:50.360- 28:54.980* :  Gus Kovan, there's been an outpouring of sadness on social media in China
*28:55.460- 29:01.120* :  after the death of a British man who'd become an unexpected online sensation. Keith Brown went viral
*29:01.120- 29:07.420* :  after his Chinese wife started filming him making what many considered to be rather unexciting sandwiches.
*29:07.920- 29:10.840* :  Our China correspondent Stephen McDonald reports from Beijing.
*29:15.060- 29:19.840* :  That's Keith Brown, or old dry Keith, as he became affectionately known in China,
*29:20.360- 29:25.540* :  but more than a million followers who took pity on him for what they thought was the hilariously
*29:25.540- 29:33.180* :  bland nature of his sandwiches. His Chinese wife, Jung, started filming him making lunch for a bit of fun,
*29:33.180- 29:38.380* :  and posting the videos on China's version of TikTok Do-Yin. As it turned out,
*29:38.380- 29:45.160* :  viewers became fascinated not only by Keith's basic diet, but also his gentle accepting philosophy
*29:45.160- 29:50.900* :  on life. Sadly, though, they were told this week that old dry Keith had died from bone cancer.
*29:50.900- 29:56.980* :  He wasn't able to travel to China recently as he'd planned, but he leaves behind an army of
*29:56.980- 30:01.220* :  friends here who never had a chance to meet him. Stephen McDonald
